EUGENE FELSNICK.

168
00:09:32,737 --> 00:09:38,188
AND SPEAKING OF EXPLOSIVES, THE
SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS DECIDED THIS
YEAR TO SUSPEND OUR

169
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:44,025
DUCK-AND-COVER EXERCISES AT THE
HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL SINCE MOST OF
YOU ARE TOO BIG TO FIT UNDER THE

170
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:44,803
DESKS.

171
00:09:44,836 --> 00:09:50,669
BUT PLEASE NOTE WE'RE ACTIVELY
LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO BUILD A
NEW BOMB SHELTER WITH ENOUGH

172
00:09:50,676 --> 00:09:52,458
ROOM FOR ALMOST EVERYONE.

173
00:09:53,282 --> 00:10:00,000
NEXT FRIDAY WILL BE OUR FIRST
PEP RALLY, AND EVERYONE KNOWS
YOU CAN'T HAVE PEP WITHOUT

174
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,220
CHEER.

175
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,288

00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,070
>> I DON'T KNOW.

831
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:33,080
IT LOOKS PRETTY HOPELESS.

832
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,090

833
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:36,230

HAVE YOU BOYS LEARNED NOTHING IN
MY CLASS?

836
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:41,070
DON'T ANSWER THAT.

837
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:41,529
ALL RIGHT.

838
00:45:41,529 --> 00:45:43,160
HOW'S THE PATIENT?

839
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,110
>> LOOK, WE JUST GOT BANG OUT
THE DENT.

843
00:45:50,529 --> 00:45:52,200
>> THE ENGINE.

844
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,060
>> WHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO GET A
NEW ENGINE?

845
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:57,190
>> BOYS, THERE'S AN OLD
SAYING -- "THERE'S A SPARE PART
IN EVERY PARKED CAR."

846
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:59,080
>> WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT?

847

>> PRISON.

848
00:45:59,497 --> 00:46:00,120
I LEARNED A LOT.

00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,130
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

850
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:04,130
>> SO, YOU'RE SAYING WE SHOULD
STEAL FROM OTHER PEOPLE'S CARS?

851
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:06,000
>> I SAID NO SUCH THING.

852
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,230
AND I WILL DENY IT TO THE BOARD
OF EDUCATION.

853
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:13,030
NO, I'M JUST INSPIRING YOU TO
FOLLOW THAT AUTOMOTIVE DREAM AND

00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,220
I DON'T WANT THE GET IN ANY
TROUBLE.

862
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:27,160
