00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,376
Hey, whoa! What are you doing?
You're not putting me on.

533
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,337
I'm just checking my web cam back home.

534
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,342
I've hidden it in a pot plant.

535
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,378
You've hidden it?

536
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:37,218
Yeah - I've turned it
into a nanny cam

537
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,724
to keep an eye on things.

538
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:43,808

ELSPETH: There's my boys.

541
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:57,075
This should help with the pain, Mr Dickens.

542
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,780
Oh, thanks.

543
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:02,827
I'm so terribly sorry.

544
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,663
That's alright, Mary.
I'm sorry about the swearing.

545
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,327
Oh, I should have realised who you were,

546
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:09,246
but Mrs Dickens said you were out of contact...

547
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,540
- No, no. It's fine.

how you and the boys are doing.

Um, give me a buzz back
when you get this message. Thanks.

00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,903
Thanks for having me.

612
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:06,692
I just can't believe it.
It's a dream.

613
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,031
Ralph, fetch the Goddess.

614
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,335
- Tada.
- I love it.

00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,592

618
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,511
Is that a line from the ad?

619
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:34,427
That's THE line.
My line, actually.

620
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:38,064
And strictly speaking, it's not an ad, it's a webisode.

621
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,815
A series of webisodes.

622
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:43,774
So the idea is, right, to post a whole bunch of clips

623
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:45,313
of you singing on the Net,

624
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,902
and in each clip, you'll play

625
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:49,238
one of these different characters.

626
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,653
And then you'll use your Goddess computer

627
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,742
to solve any little problems that might arise.

628
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,999
Have you had a chance to read the scripts yet?

629
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:59,411
- Great.
- Big day tomorrow.

- Hello?
- Oh, hi!

634
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,812
Hey.

635
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,850
- So, you got a gig.
- Yeah.

636
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:25,270
It's a Web thing.
Son of ads but on the Net.

637
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,780
- So you're back.
- Yep. Yep.

638
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,657
I left a million messages for you,

639
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:31,489
but you weren't there, and I thought,

640
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:33,904
"He wouldn't want me to miss
an opportunity like this."

641
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,788

- Yeah.
- How are the whales?

00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:45,297
- How did it go?
- Fine. Good. It went well.

Fine.

649
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,759
Don't say it's fine when you don't mean it.

650
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:54,799
- I do mean it.
- No, you don't. You're angry.

651
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:57,515
I'm not angry. I just wasn't
expecting you to be away.

652
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:59,600
- Yeah, well, I am.
- Yeah, you are.

653
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,890
When you're away, do I call up and pick fights with you?

654
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,275
Picking fights?
I'm not the one picking fights!

655
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,935
Why would you accuse me of picking fights

How do you know?

1239
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:08,309
I've been watching too.

1241
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:12,488
It is on your website.

- Bollocks.
- How could you not know that?

- Can you show me how you...
- What are you so panicked about?

1249
01:18:36,795 --> 01:18:38,672
I haven't even told him about the web cam.

1250
01:18:38,839 --> 01:18:40,716
I mean, about me doing the web cam thing,

1251

What?!

- I can't come. I'm not coming.
- This is just nerves...

I don't want to be the next big thing.

Stop. Let's just
get in the car...

for making me a nobody.

1310
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:10,426
But it's them that have turned me into somebody.

1311
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:14,313
No-one is asking you
to leave your family behind.

- Get her bags.

No, Cassandra.
I'm not coming.

1316
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:28,403
You signed a legally binding contract.

1318
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:34,499
I went to pick up the contract last night

1319
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:36,251
and she hadn't signed it.

1320
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:40,005
She... said that she was gonna
bring it this morning,

1321
01:22:40,164 --> 01:22:43,384
but she's obviously...
ripped it up... or something.

1322
01:22:43,542 --> 01:22:47,092
That's right.
There is no contract.

1331
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:15,783
so that I can break through the <i>glass</i> ceiling, yeah.

1332
01:23:15,949 --> 01:23:17,872

Don't you presume to know anything about me.

1335
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:30,931
I didn't ditch my husband.

1336
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:33,558
He left me because I couldn't have children.

1337
01:23:33,717 --> 01:23:36,015
And guess why I don't tell that story to anyone.

1338
01:23:36,178 --> 01:23:37,805
I didn't...

1339
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:42,147
Because that story makes me a sad, lonely loser.

1340
01:23:42,309 --> 01:23:45,188
So forgive me if I spin the story

1341
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:48,574
in a way that seems superficial to you, Elspeth,

1342

but that is not how I see myself.

1343
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:54,284
That is not who I am.

1344
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:56,824
I am Cassandra Wolfe.

He's not wearing any wings.

1362
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:46,650
Oh, yeah. I...
I just suggested it, and...

1363
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:48,481
I hope you don't mind.
I just...

1364
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:50,396
We just thought we'd save them for special days.

1365
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:53,566
- Is that alright?
- Of course.

1366
01:25:54,608 --> 01:25:56,952
Where's their father?

1367
01:26:03,867 --> 01:26:06,666
- Hi.
- Hey.

1368
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:09,957
I know you're angry with me.
I know why.

1369
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:12,801
I had no choice.

1370
01:26:12,959 --> 01:26:15,712
That's it?
That's the apology?

1371
01:26:15,879 --> 01:26:19,383
I was desperate for some sort of contact.

1372
01:26:19,549 --> 01:26:21,472
So that makes it OK to expose our kids

1373
01:26:21,635 --> 01:26:23,763
to every perv and weirdo who decided to log on?

1374
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:25,931
No, that was a mistake -
I left the web cam on

1375
01:26:26,098 --> 01:26:27,850
to keep an eye on the nanny, that's all.

1376
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:30,235
As soon as I knew everyone was watching, I called you.

1377
01:26:30,394 --> 01:26:31,611
- Who's the bloke?
- What bloke'?

1378
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:33,363
Oh, come on, Elspeth.
Don't do this.

1379
01:26:33,522 --> 01:26:36,241
- Rory? He's just a friend.
- Not Rory, Neil.

1380
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,902
- Who's Rory?
- Neil?

1381
01:26:38,068 --> 01:26:39,661
Yeah, Neil, who sent you perfume.

1382
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:41,197
Neil sent me perfume?

1383
01:26:41,363 --> 01:26:43,991
Oh, well...
He's just a boy, Jimmy.

1384
01:26:44,157 --> 01:26:45,409
He helped me install the web cam.

1385
01:26:45,575 --> 01:26:47,043
Why would he send you perfume?

1386
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:49,751
Because I smell?
I don't know.

1387
01:26:49,913 --> 01:26:51,631
So who's this Rory?

1388
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:53,258
Nobody.

1389
01:26:53,417 --> 01:26:55,636
I'm sorry everyone got to watch you,

1390
01:26:55,794 --> 01:26:57,796
but I'm not sorry that I got to watch you,

1391
01:26:57,963 --> 01:26:59,510
because I fell in love with you.

1392
01:26:59,673 --> 01:27:01,926
