00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,800
This is no place to make a speech,

62
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,240

You don't want to be told how unhappy you are

66
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,800

00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,080

She has lost me.

Let us welcome you to the save-a-soul mission.

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,800
Come to me! Come to me!

75
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,440
Folks, you're going to call me a liar,

76
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,840
think I ain't tellin' the truth

77
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,240
because today I'm giving away

78
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,640
solid gold watches for 1.00 each.

79
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,920
That's right, my friends,

80
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,040
a solid gold watch for one buck.

81
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,960
All that glitters is not gold.

82
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,160
More to be desired are the judgments of heaven.

83
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,720
- Gold is not enough. 
- You say it's not enough?

84
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,120
Today only I'll include a nailbrush

85
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,800
with a solid ivory top

86
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,320
and a built-in, genuine magnetic compass.

87
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,800
There you are.

88
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,720
When you're brushing your nails,

89
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,640
do you wonder where you're going?

90
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,520
Which way is north, east, south, west?

91
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,080
Which way are you going -

92
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,480
down, down, down, or up to salvation?

93
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,320
Find out at the mission absolutely free.

94
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,200
The nailbrush absolutely free! Don't crowd. Don't push.

95
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,840
There's plenty of room for everybody.

96
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,680
There's room for everybody in the kingdom of heaven, too.

97
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,040
Now, folks, I don't care whether you buy or not.

98
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,320
Let's pack up.

99
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,720
Did you notice this time a lot of them stayed

100
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,720
till you were almost halfway through?

101
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,120
If we could only sell salvation for a buck -

102
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,120
solid gold with an ivory top

103
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,920
and a built-in compass.

104
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,880
Sarah, you don't suppose those watches

105
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,800
could really be solid gold?

106
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,720
Uncle Arvide, don't you dare.

107
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,840
That's right, my friends, a solid gold watch for one buck!

108
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,640
Harry the horse!

109
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,800
Benny Southstreet.

110
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,680
Since when do you yell out the name of a person

111
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,600
in the open air, which is full of police?

112
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,000
It was a friendly impulse. I lost my head.

113
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,360
If I do not like you so much, this would now be a fact.

114
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,800
You know Nicely-Nicely Johnson.

115
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,240
Of course. How goes everything?

116
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,400
Nicely-nicely, thank you.

117
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,720
I have been waiting to hear from Nathan Detroit

118
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,080
what will be the location of his crap game.

119
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,280
We don't know yet. Nathan's been looking around.

120
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,680
But as you know, he's very hard to please.

121
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,760
Confidentially, the heat is on very hot.

122
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,720
- And it is making Nathan sweat. 
- That's too bad.

123
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,640
I would dislike to take my trade elsewhere,

124
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,520
but I'm loaded and looking for action.

125
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,920
I've just acquired 5,000 fish.

126
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,880
5,000? If it can be told, where did you take on

127
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,360
- this fine bundle of lettuce? 
- I have nothing to hide.

128
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,560
I collected the reward on my father.

129
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,000
It is an advantage to have a successful father.

130
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,320
Nobody wanted my old man for as much as 500.

131
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm worried about Nathan. Harry's not the only one.

132
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,400
There's a lot of loose money around.

133
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,320
Everybody's looking for some action.

134
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,240
- If Nathan doesn't find a place... 
- SHOP BELL JINGLES

135
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,520
Why, Lieutenant Brannigan. Mr Southstreet,

136
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,440
it is Lieutenant Brannigan of the New York City police department.

137
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,920
Have either of you seen Nathan Detroit?

138
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,440
Which Nathan Detroit is that?

139
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,880
Your boss Nathan Detroit.

140
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,920
The Nathan Detroit who runs a floating crap game.

141
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,000
- Floating crap game? 
- On a boat?

142
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,520
A crap game that moves to different spots

143
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,520
so the police can't find it.

144
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,080
Sounds difficult to do.

145
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,720
You should know since it's your job

146
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,080
to rustle up the customers and tell 'em where it is.

147
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,120
Especially with a famous detective like you putting on the heat.

148
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,400
You can give just that message to Detroit.

149
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,680
Tell him Brannigan says

150
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,760
he's not finding a spot for his crap game

151
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,320
because everybody knows Brannigan's put on the heat,

152
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,200
and Brannigan's breathing down everybody's neck.

153
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,240
Nathan, you're lucky. You just missed Brannigan.

154
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,480
I'm lucky. I just missed Brannigan.

155
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,400
He left a message. He said to tell you...

156
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,480
I am not going to find a place

157
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,320
for my crap game, because everybody knows

158
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,160
Brannigan's turned on the heat. Brannigan's breathing down everybody's neck.

159
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,640
That's what he said.

160
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,160
Won't any of the regular places take a chance,

161
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,880
- seeing it's you? 
- Seeing it's me, no.

162
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,480
Except one. Joey Biltmore's garage.

163
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,800
Joey said he might take a chance...for 1,000.

164
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,160
- 1,000! 
- In advance and in cash.

165
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,760
He would not even take my marker.

166
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,520
This I do not believe! Joey Biltmore

167
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,920
will not take your marker.

168
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,240
This Brannigan has some breath. A marker's not just a paper

169
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,120
saying "I owe you 1,000, Nathan Detroit."

170
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,440
A marker is the one pledge a guy cannot Welsh on. Never.

171
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,240
It's like not saluting the flag.

172
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,760
It does not seem possible - me without a livelihood.

173
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,600
I've been running the crap game since I was a juvenile delinquent.

174
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,720
But, Nathan, the situation's desperate.

175
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,960
You have got to think of something.

176
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,800
My only thought costs 1,000. I cannot even afford to think.

177
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,440
I'm broke. I'm so broke I couldn't even buy a present for Adelaide.

178
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,880
Is it her birthday?

179
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,560
It is mine and Adelaide's 14th anniversary.

180
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,440
We are engaged 14 years today.

181
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,880
Nathan, you must concentrate on a game.

182
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,680
The town's up to here with high players. The Greek's in town.

183
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,880
- Brandy Bottle-base. 
- Scranton slim. 
- I know. I know.

184
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,400
I could make a fortune, but to make a fortune, I need a fortune.

185
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,280
1,000 bucks. Where do I get it?

186
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,120
# The Biltmore garage wants a grand

187
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,320
# But we ain't got a grand on hand

188
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,200
# And they now have a lock on the door

189
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,840
# To the gym at public school 84

190
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,760
# There's the stockroom behind McCloskey's bar

191
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,880
# But Mrs McCloskey ain't a good scout

192
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,600
# And things bein' how they are

193
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,200
# The back of the police station is out

194
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,320
BOTH: # So the Biltmore garage is the spot

195
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,960
# But the 1,000 bucks we ain't got

196
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,360
# Why, it's good old reliable Nathan

197
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,960
# Nathan, Nathan Nathan Detroit

198
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,800
# If you're lookin' for action He'll furnish the spot

199
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,920
# Even when the heat is on It's never too hot

200
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,320
# Not for good old reliable Nathan

201
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,560
# For it's always just a short walk

202
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,520
# To the oldest established Permanent floating

203
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:51,280
# Crap game in New York

204
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,680
# There are well-heeled shooters Everywhere, everywhere

205
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,040
# There are well-heeled shooters everywhere

206
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,840
# And an awful lot of lettuce

207
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,320
# For the fella who can get us there

208
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,960
# If we only had a lousy little grand

209
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,840
# We could be a millionaire

210
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,760
# That's good old reliable Nathan

211
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,320
# Nathan, Nathan Nathan Detroit

212
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,200
# If the size of your bundle You want to increase

213
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,040
# I'll arrange that you go broke In quiet and peace

214
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,400
# In a hideout provided by Nathan

215
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,920
# Where there are no neighbours to squawk

216
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,840
# It's the oldest established Permanent floating

217
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,320
# Crap game in New York

218
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,520
# Where's the action? Where's the game?

219
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,000
# Gotta have the game or we'll die from shame

220
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,640
# It's the oldest established

221
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,640
# Permanent floating

222
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,480
# Crap game

223
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,240
# In

224
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:02,120
# New York! #

225
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,640
Gentlemen, I am deeply touched

226
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,760
by your faith and loyalty.

227
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,680
Gentlemen, do not worry.

228
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,080
Nathan Detroit's crap game will float again.

229
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,120
Nathan, guess who's sitting in Mindy's

230
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,240
- eating a steak breakfast. 
- Hitler.

231
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,000
Wrong. Sky Masterson.

232
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,520
Sky Masterson's in town. This should be

233
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,240
the greatest crap game of your career.

234
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,720
Where will it be?

235
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,680
City hall. Mayor's office.

236
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,800
- What time? 
- We will leave you know, Angie.

237
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,040
Sky Masterson, the highest player of them all.

238
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,560
What a spot I'm in.

239
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,000
He bets higher than the Greek?

240
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,400
Why do you think they call him Sky?

241
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,280
Once, with my own eyes, I saw him bet 5,000 bucks

242
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,360
that one raindrop would beat another down the window.

243
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,320
Another time he was sick, and he would not take penicillin.

244
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,520
He bet his fever would go to 104.

245
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,960
Did he win?

246
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,040
He got lucky. It went to 106.

247
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,360
So why don't I bet him?

248
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,480
Why not bet him 1,000 on something?

249
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,640
Max, what's the matter, no Danish today?

250
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,640
It's a holiday in Denmark, how do I know?

251
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,120
All these years, you've brought me Danish.

252
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,960
We ain't got Danish today.

253
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,680
Today I'm bringing you cheesecake. You want strudel instead?

254
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,760
I don't like strudel.

255
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,160
So eat the cheesecake. Live it up a little.

256
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,360
I do not understand you.

257
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,600
Everybody's crazy about Mindy's cheesecake and strudel.

258
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,120
- They must sell thousands. 
- That's just it.

259
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,040
Everybody's on cheesecake and strudel.

260
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,760
Makes me feel like I'm playing a favourite.

261
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,600
Playing the favourite...

262
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,640
Nicely, Benny... I want you to go into the kitchen

263
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,840
and find out exactly how many pieces of cheesecake they sold yesterday.

264
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,080
Also, how many pieces of strudel.

265
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,880
How much cheesecake? How much strudel?

266
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,360
Why do you want to know?

267
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,120
I'm investigating for the FBI. Go!

268
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,960
Brannigan! Stop breathing down my neck.

269
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,120
- Why, Nathan. 
- Adelaide. Doll.

270
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,840
How could you think I was Lieutenant Brannigan?

271
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,920
We don't even use the same perfume.

272
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,800
I was kind of daydreaming, I guess.

273
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,000
I don't dream about detectives, even in the daytime.

274
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Do you know what I dream about?

275
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,880
You. And your career as a businessman

276
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,920
in a normal business, and our career together

277
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,120
as a normal husband and wife.

278
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,160
- Ah-choo! 
- Gesundheit! 
- Thank you.

279
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,080
Your cold is not getting better.

280
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,920
It comes and goes. It's just a chronic condition.

281
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,800
Even if it is, it sure hangs on.

282
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,400
Nathan.

283
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,160
Speaking of chronic conditions...

284
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,960
Happy Anniversary.

285
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,400
Guess what's inside.

286
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,120
- 1,000 bucks? 
- I only wish it was.

287
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,080
Go on, open it up.

288
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,840
"Mr Nathan Detroit, General Manager."

289
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,000
- General Manager of what? 
- Whatever you set your mind on.

290
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,680
I have faith.

291
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,800
Adelaide, I... I do not have a present for you.

292
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,560
I don't mind if you don't give me a present.

293
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,800
It makes me feel like we were married.

294
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,320
There isn't anything I couldn't do without,

295
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,120
as long as you don't start running that crap game again.

296
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,680
Crap game? Adelaide, didn't I promise you?

297
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,880
- 1,200 cheesecake, 1,500 strudel. 
- What?

298
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,000
Yesterday Mindy's sold 1,200 cheesecake and 1,500 strudel.

299
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,080
- More strudel. Are you sure? 
- Straight from the baker's mouth.

300
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,520
What's this all about?

301
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,400
Statistics. Things a businessman has to have at his fingertips.

302
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,760
- Hey, any news yet? 
- I will leave you know.

303
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,400
I'm getting impatient, Detroit.

304
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,440
- And what was that about? 
- His wife's having a baby.

305
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,280
- But why is he asking you? 
- He's nervous. It's his first wife.

306
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,920
I'm expecting a fellow

307
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,840
on an important business conference.

308
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,720
Are you trying to get rid of me?

309
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,240
- No, doll, just this fella does big business. 
- Supermarkets?

310
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,600
Super super. With him, business is business. Dolls make him nervous.

311
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,000
Besides, you're late for your rehearsal.

312
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,880
Nicely, you and Benny take Adelaide by cab.

313
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,800
It's only a couple blocks.

314
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,200
The streets are covered with tourists.

315
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,120
I do not want you molested.

316
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,440
Nathan, darling, you are the most thoughtful man that ever lived.

317
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,640
- But who's paying for the cab? 
- I am, of course.

318
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,440
Sky Masterson.

319
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,160
- Detroit. 
- Is it really you?

320
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,560
How goes your percentage of life?

321
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,440
- Not bad. And you? 
- Healthy at the moment.

322
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,320
Sit. Relax. Talk. Maybe you're in a hurry.

323
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,160
My daddy always said there's only one time to hurry -

324
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,520
when the cops are coming up the stairs.

325
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,920
How about some coffee? Maybe a piece of cheesecake?

326
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,960
No, thanks. I'm pleased to hear things go well.

327
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,360
From communiques received in Las Vegas,

328
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,880
we understood Brannigan was corking up the town.

329
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,560
Ah, who worries about Brannigan? How was Vegas?

330
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,000
Paradise for two weeks.

331
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,680
For two weeks I gambled in green pastures...

332
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,400
the dice were my cousins, and the dolls were agreeable,

333
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,960
with nice teeth and no last names.

334
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,800
Sure I cannot offer you cheesecake or maybe strudel?

335
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,720
No, thanks. I just ate.

336
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,600
How long will you be in town?

337
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,800
Only for tonight. Tomorrow I fly to Havana.

338
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,400
Sky.

339
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,800
Don't think I am a pest,

340
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,560
but eat this last bite of cheesecake.

341
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,040
Honestly, I couldn't swallow a mouthful.

342
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,720
- How is Adelaide? 
- Fine, fine.

343
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,920
I suppose one day you'll be getting married.

344
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,480
- We all got to go sometime. 
- But we can fight it.

345
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,680
The companionship of a doll is a pleasant thing

346
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,560
even for a period running into months.

347
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,480
But for a lifelong relationship,

348
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,320
no doll can replace aces back to back.

349
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,240
Still, you'll admit Mindy's cheesecake

350
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,360
is the greatest cheesecake alive.

351
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,040
Gladly.

352
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,120
Furthermore, I'm quite partial to Mindy's cheesecake.

353
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,160
And although you might disagree,

354
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,120
many people prefer Mindy's strudel.

355
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,640
Do you disagree?

356
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,080
It is my understanding that the United States constitution

357
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,480
allows everybody their free choice between cheesecake and strudel.

358
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,600
I would be interested to hear...

359
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,040
offhand, would you say

360
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,880
that Mindy's sells more cheesecake or more strudel?

361
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,280
Going strictly by my personal preference,

362
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,680
I'd say more cheesecake than strudel.

363
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,280
For how much?

364
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,960
- What? 
- For how much?

365
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,280
Why, Nathan, you never lay money on the line.

366
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,840
You always take your bite off the top.

367
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,320
1,000 bucks says yesterday Mindy's sold more strudel than cheesecake.

368
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,200
Nathan, let me tell you a story.

369
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,120
Have we got a bet?

370
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,480
On the day I left home to make my way in the world,

371
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,360
my daddy took me to one side.

372
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,760
"Son," my daddy says to me,

373
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,640
"I'm sorry I'm not able to bankroll you

374
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,560
"to a very large start.

375
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,440
"But not able to get you rolling,

376
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,360
"instead, I'll stake you to some valuable advice.

377
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,240
"One day in your travels,

378
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,080
"a guy will show you a brand-new deck of cards

379
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,480
"on which the seal is not yet broken.

380
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,880
"Then he'll offer to bet you

381
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,760
"that he can make the Jack of spades

382
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,640
"jump out and squirt cider on your ear.

383
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,040
"Son, you do not accept this bet,

384
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,440
"because as sure as you stand there

385
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,280
"you're going to wind up with an ear full of cider."

386
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,200
Now, I do not suggest

387
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,160
you've been clocking Mindy's cheesecake.

388
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,040
Would I do such a thing?

389
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,480
However, if you're really looking for action,

390
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,880
I will bet you the same 1,000

391
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,320
you cannot name the colour tie you have on.

392
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,640
Have we got a bet?

393
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,000
No bet.

394
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,800
Polka dots.

395
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,680
In the whole world, nobody but Nathan Detroit

396
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,920
could blow 1,000 bucks on polka dots.

397
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,800
- Hi, Sky. 
- How goes it, Sky?

398
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,560
Healthy at the moment. And with you, Nicely?

399
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,120
Nicely-nicely, thanks. Nathan? What's wrong? You look sick.

400
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,640
A temporary disorder. The cheesecake backed up on him.

401
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,120
Maybe that's why they said they sell more strudel.

402
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,480
Adelaide gave us a message.

403
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,640
Pick her up after the show and don't be late.

404
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,640
Yes, dear. I mean OK

405
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,640
"Yes, dear"? This is husband talk.

406
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,480
Nathan, you are trapped. Adelaide is the kind of doll

407
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,280
- most difficult to unload. 
- I don't want to unload her. I love her.

408
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:02,160
If a guy does not have a doll, who would holler on him? A doll is a necessity.

409
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,920
I'm not knocking dolls. They're something to have around

410
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,800
when they come in handy, like cough drops.

411
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:14,080
What proves me right is that dolls are available all over the place.

412
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,520
Not dolls like Adelaide.

413
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,960
Nathan, nothing personal,

414
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,320
and no offence, but, figuring weight for age,

415
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,800
all dolls are the same.

416
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,720
All dolls are the same?

417
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,520
As far as the eye can see.

418
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,600
It seems a doll would come in handy on a trip to Havana.

419
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,000
How come you ain't got one?

420
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,960
How come you're going alone?

421
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,800
A matter of choice. If I wish to take a doll,

422
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,200
the supply is more than Woolworth has beads.

423
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,640
- Not high-class dolls. 
- There's only one class - indivisible, interchangeable.

424
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,400
A doll is a doll. All dolls. Any doll. You name her.

425
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:54,600
Any doll? Would you bet 1,000 bucks that if I name a doll, you can take her to Havana?

426
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,840
You've got yourself a bet.

427
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,280
MISSION BAND PLAYS

428
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,800
I name her.

429
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,080
- Her? 
- Sergeant Sarah Brown.

430
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,680
Daddy... I got cider in my ear.

431
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,160
It is my fault, you know.

432
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,080
It's not the mission, it's me.

433
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,880
I can't do the job that has to be done. I'm a failure.

434
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,280
I'd be doing the right thing

435
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,320
if I resigned and went home to Boston.

436
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:53,200
Sarah. Should you be able to bend a solid gold watch?

437
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,120
- Of course not. 
- That's what I thought.

438
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,640
Why do you want to go home,

439
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,560
because Boston has no sinners?

440
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,480
What have I accomplished here?

441
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,080
Surrounded by depraved characters and after months of work,

442
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,080
- an empty mission. 
- I'm ashamed of you.

443
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,400
Just because the riffraff of Broadway didn't break down that door

444
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,280
the minute they heard you ran this mission.

445
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,200
These aren't small-town delinquents

446
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,600
who drink too much saturday night.

447
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,000
These are the devil's first-string troops,

448
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,080
an army of devil's disciples.

449
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,720
TAP TAP

450
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,640
Do you take sinners here?

451
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,960
At any time of day or night, son. Come right in.

452
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,880
- Coffee and a doughnut? 
- Just coffee, thanks.

453
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:44,040
I'm not here because I'm hungry... not for food, that is.

454
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,800
"Blessed are they which do hunger after righteousness."

455
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,080
"Hunger and thirst after righteousness." Yes, sir, that's it.

456
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,240
My name's Arvide Abernathy.

457
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,120
The young lady is Sergeant Sarah Brown.

458
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:00,520
- To you, brother Arvide and sister Sarah. 
- How do you do?

459
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,800
Brother Sky. Hello, sister Sarah.

460
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,120
- Is that your name? Sky? 
- Sky Masterson.

461
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,120
What is it that troubles you, Mr Masterson?

462
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,520
- Brother sky. 
- I gather you're not in need of money.

463
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,920
I'm healthy at the moment. It can change.

464
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,320
Are only the unhappy poor welcome here?

465
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,720
What are you unhappy about, Son?

466
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,120
Ahem. Gambling.

467
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,720
Well, apparently you are a successful gambler.

468
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,120
Is it wrong to gamble or only to lose?

469
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,000
I better come back when I'm broke.

470
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,440
Oh, please don't misunderstand.

471
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,120
It's just unusual for a successful sinner

472
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,080
to be unhappy about sin.

473
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,560
Besides, my unhappiness appeared suddenly. Maybe it'll go away.

474
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,920
We can keep you unhappy. Give us a chance.

475
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:51,240
You don't look like a gambler. What made you take it up?

476
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,000
Evil companions.

477
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,120
Evil companions who are always offering sucker bets.

478
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,120
What is a sucker bet?

479
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,520
A bet that's reserved for suckers.

480
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,920
For a gambler, getting sucked in

481
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,400
is most humiliating,

482
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,760
but losing means you're marked as a chump.

483
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,200
- So you must win these bets. 
- Is that so terrible, being marked as a chump?

484
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,720
Among my people, being a chump is like losing your citizenship.

485
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,400
A chump is an outsider, a yokel who'll buy anything varnished.

486
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,720
- Like a solid gold watch for 1.00? 
- This is a real chump.

487
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,880
I'll get some rest before we go out again.

488
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,320
Brother Sky, I'm glad you found us.

489
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,440
Stay and talk to sister Sarah.

490
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,920
Whatever your problems are, she'll have the answer.

491
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,800
- I hope so. 
- I know so.

492
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,960
If there's one thing sister Sarah never fails in,

493
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,120
it's solving other people's problems.

494
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,040
What did he mean by that?

495
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,920
The way he said it - you never fail

496
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,440
- solving other people's problems. 
- Haven't we changed places, Mr Masterson?

497
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,400
Brother Sky. Why can't you call me brother Sky?

498
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,840
Brother Sky.

499
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,800
Aren't we discussing your problems?

500
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,440
Maybe nonsinners also have problems.

501
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,240
If you're sincerely interested

502
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,120
in giving up gambling, Mr... Brother Sky,

503
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,640
reading these pamphlets will help you.

504
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,600
Daddy always said reading pamphlets never made anybody give up anything.

505
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,560
I had a more personal help in mind.

506
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,480
We're having a midnight prayer meeting thursday.

507
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,840
Thursday's the day after tomorrow. Who's going to help me between now and then?

508
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,760
Well, our doors are always open. Come in anytime.

509
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,720
You know what I think, sister Sarah?

510
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,480
I think you not only don't want to help me,

511
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,760
- but for some reason, you're against me. 
- I'm afraid that's true.

512
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,240
I don't trust you, Mr Masterson.

513
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,800
- Brother Sky. 
- Mr Masterson.

514
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,360
You don't believe I'm a sinner.

515
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,200
I prepared to believe you're the biggest sinner I've met.

516
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,160
But you don't believe I want to repent.

517
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,640
Is that it?

518
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,480
All of a sudden you want a cup of coffee.

519
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,840
Did it ever occur to you

520
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,000
some people could be all repentance and no sin?

521
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,120
I may start a chain of missions to help your kind.

522
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,800
"Come all ye repenters.

523
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,160
"et us bring a little sin into your life."

524
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,000
"There is no peace onto the wicked. Proverbs."

525
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,560
This is wrong.

526
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,840
Let's say it's a matter of opinion, shall we?

527
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,520
I made a statement of fact. It's wrong.

528
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,960
How dare you?

529
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,800
Even if it's not a church, it is a mission!

530
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,760
- How dare you blaspheme? 
- How dare you misquote the bible?

531
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,360
- It's Isaiah, not proverbs. 
- Proverbs. 
- Isaiah.

532
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,520
Chapter 57, verse 20 or 21.

533
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,360
Would you like to bet on it?

534
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,280
Not money, just a nice sociable bet.

535
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,480
Isaiah?

536
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,560
Isaiah.

537
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:06,320
There's only one thing that's been in as many hotel rooms as I have, the Gideon bible.

538
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,880
Never tangle with me on the good book.

539
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,280
I've read it a dozen times.

540
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,200
- If that didn't help... 
- Who says it wasn't?

541
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,080
Once I found a three-horse parlay -

542
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,160
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

543
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,320
Mr Masterson, why did you come in here?

544
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,040
I told you, I'm an unhappy sinner.

545
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,680
- Excuse me, but you're a liar. 
- Excuse me, but lying is not my sin.

546
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,960
I'm not interested in a 1.00 gold watch.

547
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,760
We'll lay it on the line. We'll deal the hand open.

548
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,560
- Say that in English. 
- I'm sure you've earned your stripes courageously

549
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,600
- in active combat against the devil. 
- Don't be sarcastic.

550
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,400
But not on this particular battlefield against the devil's first-line troops.

551
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,280
You can't reach the enemy. This mission's laying an egg.

552
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,720
You don't know that.

553
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,880
You are stuck with a storeful of repentance and no customers.

554
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,960
Without sinners, repentance doesn't exist.

555
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,840
So you're stuck with a storeful of nothing.

556
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:05,360
- Was that a fair rundown? 
- I wouldn't know. I've never had a rundown.

557
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,240
Would you be open to a proposition?

558
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,840
I've had those. No.

559
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,440
Don't flatter yourself. I'm talking business.

560
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,840
I'm in a position to supply you

561
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,800
with the raw material you need for your work, namely sinners.

562
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,360
- How? 
- That's my work.

563
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,280
When is this big midnight meeting?

564
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,720
Thursday, day after tomorrow.

565
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,120
I guarantee to supply that meeting

566
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,040
with at least one dozen genuine sinners.

567
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,960
Whether they repent is up to you.

568
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,840
Thank you. That seems to be a fair rundown.

569
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,240
Now, if you will excuse me.

570
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,920
Just a minute, sister Sarah.

571
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,880
This is not charity. It's a business transaction.

572
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,760
Something you want for something I want.

573
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,400
And what is that?

574
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,480
Have dinner with me tomorrow night.

575
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,640
Why should that be something you want?

576
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,560
Maybe because I think I'll be hungry tomorrow night.

577
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,160
- Keep this. My marker. 
- Your what?

578
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,560
My IOU for at least one dozen genuine sinners

579
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,080
delivered as described.

580
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,360
- I'll pick you up tomorrow at noon. 
- At noon for dinner?

581
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,120
It takes time to get to the El Cafe Cabano.

582
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,560
- El cafe Cabano. Where's that? 
- Havana.

583
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,600
- Havana, Cuba? 
- What other Havanas are there?

584
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,480
You're taking me to dinner in Havana, Cuba?

585
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,040
They eat there, too.

586
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,400
What do you take me for, a... a chump?

587
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,800
- Ah-ah! Isaiah's on the back. 
- Get out!

588
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,120
What are they worth to you?

589
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,800
One dozen genuine sinners ready for salvation.

590
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,240
What are they worth to you, a chicken salad in a tearoom?

591
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,240
One last word, sergeant.

592
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,360
I don't want you walking out of here thinking the reason you're upset

593
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,400
is because some black-hearted sinner made improper advances...

594
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,200
- It's none of your business. 
- ..to a virtuous young lady with a shining white soul.

595
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,360
Any sinful thoughts present in this room

596
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,000
come out of you, doll, not me.

597
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,800
You're quite right. I'm nothing but a repressed, neurotic girl.

598
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,520
I've read two whole books on the subject. Abnormally attracted to sin

599
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,840
and therefore, abnormally afraid of it.

600
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,560
You're not the first to try that approach.

601
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,840
I'm happy to know that I am not the first man

602
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,920
to ever try to approach you at all.

603
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,080
- You're not even close. 
- I imagine you've succeeded in blocking all possible approaches.

604
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,600
Except for a few you wouldn't know about.

605
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,440
I only know the ones on the outskirts of society.

606
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,320
What are the approaches like on the inskirts?

607
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,560
All paved with honourable intentions?

608
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,960
- I wonder what he'll be like. 
- Who?

609
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:41,680
That upright, downright, forthright square with his close-shaved chin up

610
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,000
who, right now somewhere, is marching along the proper approach to proper you.

611
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,640
What'll he be like?

612
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,920
He will not be a gambler.

613
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,080
I know better than you what he won't be. But what will he be?

614
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:59,080
- How will you know when he gets to you? 
- Don't worry, I'll know.

615
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:03,400
# For I've imagined every bit of him

616
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,000
# From his strong moral fibre

617
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,040
# To the wisdom in his head

618
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:14,320
# To the homey aroma of his pipe

619
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,840
# You have wished yourself A small-town Galahad

620
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,760
# The breakfast-eating four-button type

621
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:27,120
# And I shall meet him When the time is ripe

622
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,160
# I'll know

623
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,480
# When my love comes along

624
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,880
# I won't

625
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,840
# Take a chance

626
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,000
# For, oh

627
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,720
# He'll be just what I need

628
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,760
# Not some fly-by-night Broadway romance

629
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,840
# And you'll know at a glance By the two pair of pants

630
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,480
# I'll know

631
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,840
# By his calm, steady voice

632
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:05,800
# Those feet on the ground

633
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,040
# I'll know

634
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,040
# As I run to his arms

635
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,800
# That at last I've come home

636
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,440
# Safe and sound

637
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,840
# Until then I shall wait

638
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:31,280
# Until then I'll be strong

639
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,440
# For I'll know

640
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,040
# When my love

641
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,800
# Comes along

642
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,240
# Mine will come As a surprise to me

643
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:56,760
# Mine I leave to chance And chemistry. #

644
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,280
Chemistry?

645
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,640
Yeah, chemistry.

646
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,880
# Suddenly I'll know

647
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,200
# When my love comes along

648
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,920
# I'll know Then and there

649
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,080
# I'll know

650
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,520
# At the sight of her face

651
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:23,960
# How I care, how I care How I care

652
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:29,040
# And I'll stop And I'll stare

653
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,120
# And I'll know

654
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:37,960
# Long before we can speak I'll know

655
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:43,280
# In my heart I'll know

656
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,120
# And I won't ever ask Am I right?

657
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,440
# Am I wise? Am I smart?

658
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,960
# But I'll stop And I'll stare

659
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:02,240
# At that face In the throng

660
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:08,080
# Yes, I'll know

661
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,920
# When my love

662
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,920
# Comes along. #

663
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:01,280
Mm-hmm. Well, that makes it necessary for me to drop back again.

664
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,120
Matthew 5:39. Don't bother looking it up.

665
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,040
It's the bit about the other cheek.

666
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,440
I know, Joey,

667
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,040
but the 1,000 bucks is guaranteed.

668
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,280
What? It's a bet I cannot lose.

669
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,720
I bet Sky Masterson

670
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,120
he could not take a certain doll to Havana.

671
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,280
Not this doll. Not this doll.

672
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,720
Now the grand finale of our round-the-world revue.

673
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,120
The Hotbox takes you out to the alley

674
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,960
with Miss Adelaide and her Alley Kittens.

675
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:08,960
Meow!

676
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,160
Meow!

677
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,280
Meow!

678
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,240
CORKS POP Meow!

679
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,760
ALL: Hello!

680
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,840
ALL: Prrr!

681
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,240
ALL: Prrr!

682
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,160
ALL: Ohh!

683
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,240
# One meow, two meow three meow, scat

684
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,360
# What's the initial of my pet tomcat?

685
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,760
# Is it A-B-C-D-E-F-G?

686
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,160
# Is it H or J or L-M-N-O-P?

687
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,240
# Is it L-M-N-O-P-Q-R-S-T?

688
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,160
# No, it's U You're the cat for me! #

689
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,000
ALL: Meow!

690
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,160
ALL: Meow!

691
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,160
ALL: Uh-uh.

692
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,720
# You know you've been mean to me

693
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,680
# And you know when you're mean to me

694
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:18,520
# How it always makes me wanna roam

695
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,480
# And you know there's a danger

696
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,520
# That some gentle stranger

697
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,280
# Might pick me up

698
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:34,440
# And make me feel at home

699
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,600
# So pet me, papa papa, pet me nice

700
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,720
# Meow Meow

701
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,760
# Ooh, pet me, papa Papa, melt the ice

702
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,600
# And you know how

703
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,240
# If you don't want me out roamin' the city

704
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,520
# Talk to me pretty Here, kitty kitty

705
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,440
# And pet me, papa Papa, pet me nice

706
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,320
# Ooh, pet me, papa Papa, pet me good

707
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,520
# Meow Meow

708
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,880
# Pet me, papa Proper, like you should

709
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,000
# And you know how

710
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,680
# If you care to keep me Home by the fire

711
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,280
# 'Specially when it's time to retire

712
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,200
ALL: # Then pet me, papa Papa, pet me good

713
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:18,120
# Warm up my saucer of milk And maybe I'll purr

714
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,080
# Lay out my cushion of silk Don't rumple my fur. #

715
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,920
THEY HISS

716
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,200
# Just reach over and

717
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,600
# Pet me, papa Papa, melt the ice

718
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,400
# If you don't want me out roamin' the city

719
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,720
# Talk to me pretty Here, kitty kitty

720
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,600
# And pet me, papa That's my good advice

721
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,120
# Pet me, papa Meow

722
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,360
# Pet me, papa Rrruff!

723
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:48,120
# Pet me, papa Papa, pet me...

724
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,600
# That'll get me!

725
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:56,000
# Pet me, papa Papa, pet me nice! #

726
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,920
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

727
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:03,000
Joey, can I tell the guys that the game will be

728
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,920
at your garage tomorrow night?

729
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,040
I would gladly pay you in advance,

730
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,800
but I will not get the money until tomorrow.

731
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,440
I need time to spread the word around.

732
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,480
Joey, listen to...

733
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,400
Yes, Joey.

734
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,880
Yes, Joey.

735
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,480
Drop dead, Joey.

736
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,920
Yes, Joey.

737
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,400
Oh, Nathan, darling.

738
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,280
You got here early. It's so thrilling

739
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,680
to find you waiting for me

740
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:38,920
just like we were married and I was coming home from work.

741
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,800
You wouldn't make me stop working, would you?

742
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,040
That would be cruel.

743
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,960
A doll like you could earn good money

744
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,600
for another ten years, easy.

745
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,680
Sweet. And you were reading my book, too.

746
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,400
See? Reading don't make people go blind.

747
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,280
- It's very interesting, isn't it? 
- What is?

748
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,800
Oh, the book. Yeah.

749
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,680
The doctor gave it to me.

750
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,600
He thought it might help me get rid of my cold.

751
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,080
With a book?

752
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,680
The doctor thinks my cold

753
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,480
might possibly be caused by psychology.

754
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:13,560
Ah... How does he know you got psychology?

755
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:18,240
Nathan, everybody has got it. And female psychology explains

756
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:22,520
why certain girls do certain kinds of things.

757
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,320
It's all in the book.

758
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,200
Must be some book.

759
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,880
Uh... would it tell you

760
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,760
what kind of a doll would go for a guy

761
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,880
which you wouldn't think she would do so?

762
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:42,080
Nathan, no matter how terrible a fella seems,

763
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:45,720
you can never be sure that some girl won't go for him.

764
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,760
Take us.

765
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,960
Get dressed. We'll go eat.

766
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:57,360
Uh... starting next week, Nathan, I will be getting a raise in salary.

767
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,680
Where does it say what different dolls will do?

768
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:05,200
- You're not even listening to me! Ah-choo! 
- Gesundheit.

769
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,040
I'll be making enough for us to finally get married.

770
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,480
What do you think?

771
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,200
Hmm? Oh, of course we'll get married...

772
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,640
sooner or later.

773
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,920
Nathan, after 14 years, it is already too late to be sooner,

774
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,200
and if it gets much later,

775
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,840
soon, it will be too late even to be later.

776
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,880
- Ah-choo! 
- Gesundheit.

777
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:28,560
Besides, Nathan, I don't know what to do about mother.

778
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,000
What about your mother?

779
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,360
This is something that I haven't told you before,

780
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,680
but my mother, back in Rhode island,

781
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:40,080
she thinks that... That we are already married.

782
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,960
How could she think such a thing?

783
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,800
Maybe because I wrote her that we were already married.

784
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,200
That would make her think so.

785
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:53,480
Nathan, in Rhode island, people do not remain engaged for 14 years.

786
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,080
They get married.

787
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,000
So how come it's such a small state?

788
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,880
Furthermore, after about two years...

789
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,600
After about two years, we...

790
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,960
- We got a divorce? 
- We had a baby.

791
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,840
You wrote your mother we had a baby?

792
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:13,200
I had to, Nathan. Mother kept after me,

793
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,080
and finally I just ran out of excuses.

794
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,880
- And what type baby was it? 
- It was a boy.

795
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:24,320
- I named it after you, Nathan. 
- Thank you. 
- You're welcome.

796
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,080
And tell me, what has Nathan Jr Been doing all these years?

797
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,760
Well, right now he's in boarding school.

798
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,200
I wrote mother

799
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,560
that he won the football game last saturday.

800
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,440
I wish I had a bet on it.

801
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,920
But, Nathan, that...

802
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,400
..that isn't all.

803
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,680
Don't tell me we also have got an Adelaide Jr?

804
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:52,680
All these years, Nathan. Mother believes in big families,

805
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,600
and we had such an early start.

806
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,040
Just give me the grand total.

807
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,080
- Five. 
- Adelaide!

808
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:06,000
How could you do such a thing

809
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,880
to a nice old broad like your mother?

810
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,680
Nathan, darling, let's just us get married,

811
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,880
and I'll handle everything else. OK?

812
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,000
OK, doll. When we're ready.

813
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,840
Nathan, we're ready now. We've been ready for 14 years.

814
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,680
All we need now is a license

815
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,280
- and a blood test. 
- Blood test?

816
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,680
Don't worry, Nathan. You've got blood.

817
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,080
What a city.

818
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:35,440
First they close my crap game, then they open my veins.

819
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,840
You gave up the crap game.

820
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:42,520
Of course I did, doll. For you. Because I love you.

821
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,840
Can I borrow some earrings?

822
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,280
It is customary, Laverne,

823
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,080
to knock when entering the private dressing room

824
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,040
of an engaged person.

825
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,480
As far as I'm concerned, you are in here by yourself.

826
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,760
May I borrow some earrings?

827
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,160
- Diamonds or pearls? 
- Diamonds.

828
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,080
Top drawer of the trunk. The big box.

829
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,160
Aren't they a little long, dear?

830
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,080
Remember, you've got a short neck.

831
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,480
He's a tall man.

832
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,080
You! I'm all dated up

833
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,000
with society max tomorrow night,

834
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,320
and he breaks it, on account of your silly crap game!

835
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,000
Adelaide, look at me. I'm on my knees!

836
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,440
Oh, get up.

837
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,280
It reminds me of your crap game.

838
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:48,560
- Adelaide, doll! 
- Ah-choo!

839
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,640
- You're getting upset about nothing. 
- Ah-choo!

840
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,640
- I set it up a long time ago. 
- Ah-choo!

841
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,000
- Understand? 
- Ah-choo!

842
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,840
Look, we love each other. We're going to get married.

843
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,280
We'll be happy.

844
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,320
Get out of my life, Nathan Detroit!

845
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,320
- I knew you'd understand. 
- Ah-choo! 
- Gesundheit.

846
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,520
It says here...

847
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:49,360
# The average unmarried female

848
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,240
# Basically insecure

849
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,600
# Due to some long frustration

850
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,240
# May react

851
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:03,160
# With psychosomatic symptoms

852
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:05,800
# Difficult to endure

853
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:10,920
# Affecting the upper respiratory tract

854
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,800
# In other words

855
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,080
# Just from waitin' around

856
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,600
# For that plain little band of gold

857
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:23,080
# A person Could develop a cold

858
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:29,080
# You could spray her wherever You figure the streptococci lurk

859
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,800
# You can give her a shot For whatever she's got

860
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,840
# But it just won't work

861
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,520
# If she's tired of gettin' that fish-eye

862
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,840
# From the hotel clerk

863
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,400
# A person

864
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,520
# Can develop a cold. #

865
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,080
It says here...

866
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:50,800
# The female remaining single

867
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,680
# Constantly in suspense

868
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,920

00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:03,200
# And she can hear church bells chime

00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,960
# The compartment is air conditioned

891
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:12,640

# And a sinus that's really A pip... #

898
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,240
Ah-choo!

899
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,680
# From a lack of community property

900
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,920
# And a feeling she's getting too old

00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,320
# And stray no more

00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,400
# Stray no more

907
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,400
# Stray no more

908
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,000
# Put down the bottle

909
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,600
# And we'll say no more

910
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,720
# Follow. #

911
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,640
If you'd arrived one minute earlier,

912
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,720
you would've witnessed Miss Sarah give Sky Masterson a 100% brush-off.

913
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:53,040
So the 1,000 for Joey Biltmore is practically in your pocket. You should be jumping for joy.

914
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,400
I'm jumping.

915
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,600
You got work to do, arrangements to make.

916
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,320
A shave and a hot towel will fix you up.

917
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,160
For who should I have a shave? For who should I have a hot towel?

918
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,720
Do you know what is at stake here?

919
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,800
Nathan Detroit's crap game, because of a doll.

920
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,680
I cannot believe that a businessman like you

921
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,320
could let himself go and fall in love with his own fiancee.

922
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:16,120
All right! So Adelaide's my weakness.

923
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,920
Can you not be tolerant of my weakness,

924
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,400
especially since it's the sad condition

925
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,520
guys are in all over the world? Look.

926
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,440

927
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,520

00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,320
# And it looks like I'm just another victim. #

944
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,000
Yes, sir.

945

# When you see a guy Reach for stars in the sky

# The guy's only doin' it for some doll! #

975
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:35,600
Well, I think we finally managed to shake off the prince of darkness.

976
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,640
You certainly did your best to discourage him.

977
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,160
I certainly did.

978
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,600
Arvide.

979
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:46,000
General Cartwright, what a pleasant surprise.

980
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,880
We didn't even know you were in town.

981
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,760
Flew in from Boston early this morning.

982
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,200
Important luncheon meeting.

983
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,080
While waiting, thought I'd check our outposts.

984
01:00:56,080 --> 01:01:00,480
I must say, I was surprised to find the mission unattended

985
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,360
in a neighborhood as unsavory as this.

986
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,320
Why should you be surprised, general?

987
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,720
You've seen our records.

988
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,920
We can't get anyone in here even to rob us.

989
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:12,920
Yes. Well, now that you've brought it up,

990
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,840
I must confess I've come for a purpose...

991
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,240
an unhappy one, I'm afraid.

992
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:21,120
I know it doesn't look as if we're accomplishing anything, but in time...

993
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:24,000
Time is what we can no longer afford.

994
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,760
My good friends, after careful deliberation,

995
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,320
national headquarters has decided

996
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,240
to close this branch of the mission.

997
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:33,960
- Close the mission? 
- No, general, please.

998
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:37,720
Even if I haven't made it a success, someone will.

999
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:40,520
Sarah, if you can't attract sinners, nobody can.

1000
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:43,360
There are so many calls on us, dear,

1001
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:46,080
other places where our work's needed.

1002
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,520
KNOCK ON DOOR

1003
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:50,520
How do you do? I don't believe we've met,

1004
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:52,520
Brother...?

1005
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,960
Brother Sky Masterson, former sinner.

1006
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,320
I'm general Cartwright, regional director.

1007
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,480
Why isn't his name on the progress report?

1008
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,920
- What were you doing in there? 
- I was resting, sister Sarah.

1009
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,280
I was going to ask brother Arvide

1010
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:10,200
if I could carry the drum this afternoon.

1011
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:14,440
General, on behalf of future former sinners, I protest the closing of this mission.

1012
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:15,880
General, I should explain...

1013
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:21,000
Sarah, this man has a right to be heard. Continue, brother Sky.

1014
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:27,440
General, would you be open to a proposition?

1015
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,600
The General's leaving this afternoon.

1016
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:32,480
She will not be available for dinner tonight.

1017
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,560
Sarah, what are you talking about?

1018
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:37,720
What have you got in mind, young man?

1019
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,160
Faith in Sister Sarah.

1020
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,520
I ask you to give her 36 hours to prove

1021
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,440
that she can make this mission pay off.

1022
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:48,280
Savings souls shouldn't be referred to as "paying off."

1023
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:49,520
Why 36 hours?

1024
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:52,920
Because he knows our big meeting in 36 hours

1025
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,920
- will be a great success. 
- Uncle Arvide.

1026
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,880
How can you guarantee that, Brother Sky?

1027
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:03,600
Well, let's just say I have a feeling about it.

1028
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,880
"If sinners entice thee, consent thou not."

1029
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,320
That's the wrong thought.

1030
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:10,080
Where is yesterday's thought for the day?

1031
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,520
Top right-hand drawer.

1032
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,440
Excuse me, General.

1033
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:18,560
Before going to the expense of a big meeting,

1034
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:22,640
we'd require more than just a feeling that it will be successful.

1035
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,520
Oh, it's a very strong feeling, General.

1036
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:29,840
Ah. "There is no peace to the wicked." Isaiah 57:21.

1037
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,320
That is correct.

1038
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,280
General, my proposition is this -

1039
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,120
why don't you come to tomorrow's midnight meeting

1040
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,080
and find out for yourself?

1041
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:43,840
Well, if I thought there was a chance of finding definite progress, any sizable turnout...

1042
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:56,680
What do you think, Sister Sarah?

1043
01:03:56,680 --> 01:04:02,480
Don't you honestly believe that this mission could be saved within the next 36 hours?

1044
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,120
General Cartwright.

1045
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:14,120
I am in a position to guarantee you personally

1046
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,600
at least one dozen genuine sinners.

1047
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:19,520
- Hallelujah! 
- Hallelujah!

1048
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,320
Halle...

1049
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:24,240
lujah.

1050
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,520
Be sure you're wearing your carnation.

1051
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,120
Remember, nobody gets in the crap game

1052
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,280
without they got a red carnation.

1053
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:38,720
It's like a password. Nathan's orders.

1054
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,720
- We got the flowers. 
- Where is the action?

1055
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,360
Once Nathan arrives, we're...

1056
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,720
He has arrived. Is it all set?

1057
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:50,560
Can I tell the customers it's Joey Biltmore...

1058
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:53,880
Not till I put the 1,000 in Joey's hand. I haven't got it yet.

1059
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,080
Nicely's waiting for Sky at his hotel.

1060
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:58,720
The minute Sky gives him the money, nicely brings it to me.

1061
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,560
They won't stick around much longer. They're getting nervous.

1062
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,040
I'm not nervous?

1063
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,840
Well, Harry the Horse. How's everything in Brooklyn? The same?

1064
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,880
I hope you will not spoil our evening,

1065
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:14,440
Inasmuch as I happen to be entertaining a very prominent guest tonight.

1066
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:18,480
I would like you to meet Big Jule from Chicago.

1067
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,400
I would like you to meet Big Jule from Chicago.

1068
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,320
Big Jule, welcome to our fair city,

1069
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,640
in which, as you know, the heat is on.

1070
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:31,520
However, if you will be patient, you will be provided with action.

1071
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:39,800
What do you say, Big Jule, should we stick around or blow?

1072
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:43,160
I come here to shoot crap. Let's shoot crap.

1073
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:46,760
- Order another milkshake and relax. 
- Nathan.

1074
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:52,520
Do not let the fact that Big Jule drinks milk give you wrong ideas.

1075
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,880
Big Jule does not like to be displeased.

1076
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,280
Why, Harry, did I give the impression

1077
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,680
that I was being rude to a guest who has

1078
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:02,440
such a well-deserved reputation?

1079
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,480
Big Jule, I'm sure

1080
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,760
that you did not misunderstand my kidding remarks.

1081
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:10,120
It's just that one look at your kindly face,

1082
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:13,360
which is so full of fun, good fellowship...

1083
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,200
Could I have a swallow of your milk?

1084
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:21,120
Well, well, well...

1085
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,840
what have we here?

1086
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,360
The jails must be empty tonight.

1087
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,960
Can anybody be missing?

1088
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,760
Harry the Horse, Liver Lips Louie,

1089
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:37,160
Angie the Ox,

1090
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,760
Society Max...

1091
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:44,080
And here's a face for which I cannot supply a name.

1092
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:46,920
May I ask where you come from?

1093
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:51,160
- East Cicero, Illinois. 
- And what is your occupation there?

1094
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:56,440
I'm a scoutmaster.

1095
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:00,160
Don't ever help my mother across the street.

1096
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:04,960
Such lovely red carnations.

1097
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,920
Is it a funeral?

1098
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:12,320
Did somebody die suddenly that I don't know about yet?

1099
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,320
What's on, Nathan?

1100
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:25,520
What brings these senior delinquents together?

1101
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,600
They got lonely. How do I know?

1102
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,520
And why are they all wearing red carnations?

1103
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:34,320
- They're also all wearing pants. 
- You're up to no good!

1104
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,560
Is it now a crime to wear flowers?

1105
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:39,120
Is Mindy's suddenly a hideout for gangsters?

1106
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,880
Lieutenant, I'll confess.

1107
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,960
We're smuggling hot cheesecake into Canada.

1108
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:51,560
This is all I need. It's complete.

1109
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:54,920
Everybody in the whole world who hates me

1110
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,400
is now here.

1111
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:10,640
What's the use, Nathan? Why try to keep it a secret?

1112
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:14,120
- Bite your tongue, Benny! 
- OK, Southstreet, let's have it. What's this all about?

1113
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:17,120
- It's A... it's a party, lieutenant. 
- What kind of party?

1114
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:21,800
A bachelor dinner for Nathan Detroit. He's getting married.

1115
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,080
# For he's a jolly good fellow

1116
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,760
ALL: # For he's a jolly good fellow

1117
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:28,400
# For he's a jolly good fellow

1118
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,720
BIG JULE: # Which nobody cannot deny! #

1119
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:35,200
Ooh! Oh, Nathan, darling, I'm so thrilled.

1120
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:37,120
Why didn't you tell me?

1121
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:40,160
Well, it was going to be a surprise wedding.

1122
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:42,560
You certainly had me fooled, Detroit.

1123
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,480
When is the happy occasion?

1124
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:48,760
It's going to take time to get the blood test and the license.

1125
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:51,880
Gee, wouldn't it be wonderful if we could get married tomorrow night?

1126
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:53,920
Right after the new show opens at the hotbox.

1127
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:57,280
Adelaide, according to the laws under which we live,

1128
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:58,840
it's going to take a little time.

1129
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:03,160
- You could elope. 
- You are telling me to violate the law?

1130
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,280
It's legal to elope at your age.

1131
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:08,640
And Maryland will marry you right away. No blood test.

1132
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,840
Ain't that unhealthy?

1133
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:14,680
Nathan, the lieutenant has a romantic suggestion of which I approve.

1134
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:19,000
Elope. And for the trip, I will loan you my getaway car.

1135
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,960
That is, my station wagon.

1136
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:27,120
Oh, Nathan, darling, let's do it. Please?

1137
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:38,360
OK. Deal me in.

1138
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:44,920
- Speech, Nathan. 
- Speech. 
- Give us a speech.

1139
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,400
ALL: Speech! Speech!

1140
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:53,600
# Unaccustomed as I am to getting married

1141
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,960
# I am taking this occasion here to say

1142
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:01,960
# That me

1143
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:04,360
# And Adelaide

1144
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:06,480
# Are finally

1145
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:12,080
# Naming the day

1146
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:15,120
# Though she knows deep in her heart

1147
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:22,320
# I'm a phony, and I'm a fake She wants five children to start

1148
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:26,280
# Five's a difficult point to make

1149
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,720
# But

1150
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:32,320
# Adelaide Adelaide

1151
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:35,320

01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:38,840
# Is takin' a chance on me

1153
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:45,560
# Takin' a chance I'll be respectable and nice

1154
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:50,480
# Give up cards and dice And go for shoes and rice

1155
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,640
# So, gentlemen Deal me out

1156
01:10:53,640 --> 01:11:00,040
# Do not try to feel me out I got no more evenings free

1157

# Since Adelaide Adelaide

# Talk about your long shots Takin' a chance on me. #

1160
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:23,400
Well, my congratulations, too, and I certainly hope

1161
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:26,720
there's nothing in heredity.

1162
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:29,680
It might seem unimportant on the night before your wedding,

1163
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:32,080
but your blintzes are getting cold.

1164
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,920
Who cares? As long as Nathan stays hot.

1165
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:38,760
Don't forget to bring my purse to the Hotbox.

1166
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,200
Darling, I'm so excited.

1167
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:43,120
I don't even want to go back to work.

1168
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:46,960
I've got so much to do before tomorrow night.

1169
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:51,240
What about my mother? I've got to write her.

1170
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:56,080
- What'll I say? 
- Send a telegram. Date it back 14 years.

1171

# On me. #

1188
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:53,520
Nathan, you are indeed a most lucky fella.

1189
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,440
She is a most beautiful doll indeed.

1190
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,880
Do you agree, big Jule?

1191
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,080
Tell me - how long do you know the doll?

1192
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:01,640
- 14 years. 
- Let's shoot crap.

1193
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:07,080
- Nathan. 
- You got the money?

1194
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:09,920
Sky wasn't at the hotel or the mission?

1195
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,880
I'm trying to tell you.

1196
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:15,160
- He must be with the mission band. 
- Nathan, wait!

1197
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:17,240
MISSION BAND PLAYS

1198
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:37,520
SINGING IN SPANISH

1199
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:01,240
"This church is for the most part Spanish baroque,

1200
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:02,680
"built of native limestone.

1201
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:07,640
"The original church was built on this site in 1674

1202
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:12,400
"and reconstructed between 1704 and 1724."

1203
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,320
It's almost impossible to believe.

1204
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:17,200
Well, that's not very old for a church.

1205
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:21,480
- Long before 1674, there were missionaries... 
- What does it say about the moonlight?

1206
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:23,720
The moonlight?

1207
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:26,840
- Mm-hmm. 
- It's very bright, isn't it?

1208
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:29,800
So bright you're reading your guidebook by it.

1209
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,720
Now that you mention it.

1210
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:34,600
What does it say about the music?

1211
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,880
- The music? 
- Mm-hmm.

1212
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,280
It's a lovely tune.

1213
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:45,320
Let me read out of Sky Masterson's guidebook about you.

1214
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:48,200
You could be locked away in a room

1215
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:52,520
with no sun, no moon, no laughter, no music, no love,

1216
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,000
and you wouldn't care.

1217
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:57,520
You could still be a missionary.

1218
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:03,080
"The cobblestones in this plaza

1219
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,480
"are approximately four centuries old.

1220
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:08,800
"They are the very cobblestones that were put down

1221
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,240
by the Spanish colonists in 1519."

1222
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:22,120
Buenas tardes. Que van a tomar?

1223
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,160
What's your pleasure?

1224
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:26,080
Oh, drinking.

1225
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:28,520
What's your pleasure?

1226
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:34,600
- Milk, please. 
- Don't make a spectacle of yourself. 
- Milk.

1227
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:37,520
You're a united states citizen in a foreign country.

1228
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:41,360
Where's your pride in what the world thinks about America?

1229
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:44,320
- Milk. 
- Milk.

1230
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:49,560
- Dulce de leche. Dos. 
- Leche dulce, dos. Si, senor.

1231
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,960
What did you order?

1232
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:57,320
Dulce de leche. Dulce is Spanish for sweet.

1233
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:01,120
- De means of. Leche means milk. 
- Sweet of milk.

1234
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,040
Don't they serve it plain?

1235
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:06,920
Only in the mornings. It has to do with the heat.

1236
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:10,120
At night, they put a kind of a preservative in it.

1237
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:12,440
That's interesting. What do they use?

1238
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:14,720
- Bacardi. 
- Bacardi?

1239
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:19,160
Doesn't that have alcohol in it?

1240
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:22,080
Just enough to keep the milk from turning sour.

1241
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:31,800
That's the same song we heard near the church, isn't it?

1242
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:35,160
Playing the tambourine has developed your ear for music.

1243
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:41,680
Mr Masterson, you think I'm an awful prude, don't you?

1244
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:45,280
- Are you? 
- Well, I wonder sometimes.

1245
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:53,360
For instance, supposing I wasn't in mission work...

1246
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,680
Mm-hmm.

1247
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:59,920
Mmm. This is a tasty milkshake.

1248
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,840
Do you mind if I have another?

1249
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:09,320
Supposing I was just any girl.

1250
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:14,120
Would any girl be a prude if she refused to go to Havana

1251
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:16,560
with a man she'd never met?

1252
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,240
Oh, I suppose not.

1253
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:22,120
Would you like to try some of my milkshake

1254
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:27,080
- while you're waiting for yours? 
- Oh, just a sip.

1255
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:31,320
Oh, thanks.

1256
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:37,040
I don't know when I've been so thirsty.

1257
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:42,640
Still, you do think I'm a prude, don't you?

1258
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,840
- I don't know what you are. 
- You must think I'm something.

1259
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:49,080
You're something all buttoned up, all except one button.

1260
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,720
Oh, isn't it awful?

1261
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:54,840
It's a nervous habit. It's so silly.

1262
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:07,080
SLURPING

1263
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:12,400
I'm sorry. I just wasn't thinking. It's so delicious.

1264
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:16,520
That bacardi flavouring certainly makes a difference, doesn't it?

1265
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:19,720
Oh, yeah. nine times out of 10.

1266
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:22,200
You know, this would be a wonderful way

1267
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,640
to get children to drink milk.

1268
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:29,360
SAME MELODY CONTINUES TO PLAY

1269
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,880
A melody can have the same notes,

1270
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:46,240
but suddenly it's a different song.

1271
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:49,600
- Again, please? 
- That song.

1272
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,480
Before it was just romantic, just silly slush.

1273
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:57,280
Now it's playing inside of me all true and honest,

1274
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:00,320
as if my heart were beating the drum.

1275
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:08,200
How much do you know about life?

1276
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:11,080
Only a little bit around the edges.

1277
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,960
- Tell me about life. 
- All about it?

1278
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:15,400
How to live.

1279
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:17,640
Doing what you want,

1280
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:20,200
having what you want, saying what you want.

1281
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:25,440
- Being what you want. 
- Nobody can. Nobody does.

1282
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,840
If you could, you probably wouldn't want to.

1283
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:30,240
You're wrong, brother Sky. You're wrong.

1284
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:32,160
You tell me about life.

1285
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:35,040
You don't believe I could, don't you?

1286
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,480
I believe I could.

1287
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:41,280
After all, it was you that came to me for help, isn't that so?

1288
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:45,480
Because you were unhappy. What were you unhappy about, Sky?

1289
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,400
I can't remember this minute.

1290
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:50,040
But you do remember I failed you.

1291
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:53,800
I was weighed in the balance and found wanting.

1292
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:58,560
- Daniel 5:27. 
- For that I am truly sorry.

1293
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,960
But I intend to make it up to you.

1294
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:07,120
I intend to give you all the help you will ever require.

1295
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:10,120
You have given me a great deal of help already.

1296
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:14,400
You don't think I remember, don't you? But I do.

1297
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,760
Every word, as if you were saying it now.

1298
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,880
What?

1299
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:23,920
About having a more... personal help in mind...

1300
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,760
..when I gave you those silly old pamphlets,

1301
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:32,600
as if they could take the place of a truly personal help.

1302
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:39,560
SLURPING

1303
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:42,440
How can a sinner hope to be saved

1304
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:44,840
by maybe one hour of help,

1305
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,240
when for 23 he must fight temptation alone?

1306
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:52,040
- How indeed? 
- It's been done with people who drink too much.

1307
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:56,200
Help day and night, night and day. Anywhere, anytime.

1308
01:20:56,200 --> 01:21:00,000
- That's a full-time job. 
- You're a full-time sinner.

1309
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,400
Maybe a little time off for good behaviour?

1310
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:06,360
Pal, you're not going to fight alone anymore.

1311
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:10,160
What if it's against mission policies? Private lessons in salvation?

1312
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:11,640
Because I'm going to be with you.

1313
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:14,480
A one-woman mission for the personal salvation of me?

1314
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,960
Day and night. Night and day.

1315
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:20,240
Sister Sarah, why would you want to?

1316
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:22,640
Whatever you do, wherever you go.

1317
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:26,000
- Why, Sister Sarah, why? 
- I want to be with you.

1318
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,960
The world's full of souls

1319
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:30,960
- closer to salvation than mine. 
- Anytime, anywhere.

1320
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,360
Easier to save and much more worth saving.

1321
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,000
You, you...

1322
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,840
Please say something.

1323
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:51,600
I've got to know what you're thinking.

1324
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,040
I'm thinking...

1325
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:05,040
..it's time you had your dinner.

1326
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:11,520
SAME MELODY: # Hay en tu mirar

BELL CONTINUES RINGING

1343
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:55,920
- Oh. 
- Still dizzy?

1344
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:00,400
You won't believe me, but with my head underwater,

1345
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:03,800
- I actually heard bells ringing. 
- I'll believe you.

1346
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,560
Ask me how do I feel?

1347
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:09,160

01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:24,400

# Ding! #

1382
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:41,920
We just got time to catch the last plane to New York.

1383
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:45,720
- People miss planes. It happens. 
- Yeah.

1384
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:51,080
It also happens that people win with loaded dice.

1385
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:54,680
- I know what I'm doing. 
- Do ya, kid?

1386
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:57,800
I don't.

1387
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:04,560
Suddenly I'm playing by a whole new book of rules.

1388
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:05,960
You make me feel

1389
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:10,120
as if I were a dishonest horse race or something.

1390
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:12,400
The bells rang. They really rang.

1391
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:17,400
They weren't magical bells for lovers full of rum and music on a make-believe island.

1392
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:20,280
They rang to tell us what time it is.

1393
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:22,920
Shall we synchronise our watches?

1394
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:25,760
I know the night-time. I live in it.

1395
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:27,600
It does funny things to you.

1396
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:34,240
You must be trying to tell me I'd hate myself in the morning.

1397
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:41,160
I look as if I'd been in a fight or something.

1398
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:44,040
You know, you're the most mixed-up man

1399
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:47,560
- I've ever met in my life. 
- Easily.

1400
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:49,480
All that nonsense about night-time,

1401
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:51,640
daytime, rule books and such.

1402
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:55,120
Sarah.

1403
01:30:57,480 --> 01:31:00,320
You know why I brought you to Havana?

1404
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:03,200
Because I made a bet that I could.

1405
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:07,520
That's why I came to the mission, to win a bet.

1406
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:10,000
Why not? You're a gambler.

1407
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:12,280
And, darling...

1408
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:16,160
..you are also a chump.

1409
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:59,160
We're blocks from the mission.

1410
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:02,520
Come on. A little walk will do you good.

1411
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:06,120
- What time is it? 
- It's dawn any minute.

1412
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,640
What makes the light so strange and white?

1413
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:17,040
Because only in times square,

1414
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:20,480
the dawn gets turned on by an electrician.

1415
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:24,760
Listen.

1416
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:26,360
What?

1417
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:27,560
Footsteps.

1418
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,600
Now is the time you can hear footsteps on Broadway.

1419
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:22,600
A cup of coffee?

1420
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:25,880
No.

1421
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:28,000
Doughnut?

1422
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,760
No.

1423
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:31,600
Dulce de leche?

1424
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:37,760
# Do dum #

1425
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,880
# ba ba bum #

1426
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:42,280
# da da dee da da... #

1427
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:44,640
you remember that tune pretty well.

1428
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:47,040
It keeps running through my heart.

1429
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:49,120
It's got words, you know.

1430
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:53,200
Something about "amor, amor", I'll bet.

1431
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:56,240
It's about you.

1432
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:01,960
About you right now.

1433
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:07,800
# Your eyes are the eyes

1434
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:11,680
# Of a woman in love

1435
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:19,320
# And, oh how they give you away

1436
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:23,160
# Why try to deny

1437
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:26,680
# You're a woman in love

1438
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:30,040
# When I know very well

1439
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:33,360
# What I say

1440
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:37,920
# I say no moon in the sky

1441
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:41,480
# Ever lent such a glow

1442
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:47,840
# Some flame deep within made them shine

1443
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:57,080
# Those eyes are the eyes of a woman in love

1444
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:02,480
# and may they gaze evermore

1445
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:05,840
# Into mine

1446
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:09,680
# Tenderly gaze

1447
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:15,960
# Evermore into mine

1448
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:19,880
# And what about you?

1449
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:24,720
# It's got you, too

1450
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:30,240
# Your eyes are the eyes

1451
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:33,560
# Of a man who's in love

1452
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:41,000
# That same flame deep within made them shine

1453
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:45,760
# Your eyes are the eyes

1454
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:49,960
- # Of a man who's in love 
- Woman in love

1455
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:58,760
BOTH: # And may they gaze evermore Into mine

1456
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:04,400
# Crazily gaze

1457
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:07,840
# Evermore

1458
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:14,440
# Into mine. #

1459
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:18,280
MISSION DRUM BEATS

1460
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:32,600
- Uncle Arvide, where have you been? 
- Good morning, Sarah. Good morning, Brother Sky.

1461
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:36,800
- We took your advice. 
- We've been out all night on a crusade against the devil.

1462
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:38,800
SIREN

1463
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:51,840
Come on, fellas! Cheese it, it's the cops. Come on, guys. Let's go!

1464
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:57,280
SIRENS GETTING CLOSER

1465
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:01,560
- Nathan, what is this? 
- Bingo.

1466
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:06,040
Wait a minute. Where are you all going? I'm out ten Gs.

1467
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:22,520
It's no use. They were tipped off.

1468
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:26,160
I suppose you can explain all this, Miss Brown.

1469
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:28,440
Explain? Explain what?

1470
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:33,240
I guess it was just a coincidence the mission was open and empty all night

1471
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:36,920
while everybody suddenly took off on an all-night crusade.

1472
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:41,200
But you yourself didn't go on the crusade, and you weren't here.

1473
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:44,400
Now maybe that's two coincidences.

1474
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:48,720
Masterson, I had you in my big-time book.

1475
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:51,600
Now I suppose I'll have to reclassify you

1476
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:53,840
under "shills and decoys".

1477
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:19,560
You certainly do know the nighttime, don't you, and the funny things it does?

1478
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:23,560
- It certainly did them to me. 
- Answer only one question.

1479
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:27,640
It didn't do much thanks to you, not me. Just more than enough.

1480
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:29,640
- Answer one question. 
- Any question.

1481
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:32,760
- Am I now supposed to prove to you... 
- There's nothing to prove.

1482
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:35,160
You're taking for granted I'm guilty as charged.

1483
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:39,320
Everything that was to be proved has already been proved. If I hadn't gone with you,

1484
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:42,800
- this would never have happened. 
- You went with me to help the mission. 
- Did I?

1485
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:46,880
I can't remember that far back.

1486
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:49,360
Oh, Sarah.

1487
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:53,720
Is that really why I went with you, to help the mission?

1488
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:56,120
Is that really why you took me?

1489
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:57,560
To win the bet, I told you!

1490
01:38:57,560 --> 01:39:00,560
Was that all of the bet, Sky?

1491
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:05,040
- What do you take me for? 
- Or was there more, much more?

1492
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:10,520
Did you win the bet? Did you truly win all of the bet?

1493
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:12,920
What do you take yourself for?

1494
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:14,840
What kind of doll are you?

1495
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:17,840
A daytime doll. A mission doll.

1496
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:41,840
TIN CAN RATTLES

1497
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:06,240
EMCEE: And now the feature attraction of our all new Four-D Follies,

1498
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:08,160
the Hotbox proudly presents

1499
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:10,760
miss Adelaide and her debutantes.

1500
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:18,680
- Nicely, nicely, thank you. 
- I didn't ask how you are. 
- Don't.

1501
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:20,440
What are you doing here? Where's Nathan?

1502
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:24,440
Nathan. That's what I'm doing here. I'm supposed to bring miss Adelaide a message from him.

1503
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:26,920
I wish Nathan would bring his own messages.

1504
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:41,360
# He bought me the fur thing

1505
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:43,040
# Five winters ago

1506
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:46,040
# And the gown the following fall

1507
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:49,840
# Then the necklace, the bag the hat and the shoes

1508
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:53,880
# Oh, what generous gifts I recall

1509
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:59,400
# Then last night in his apartment

1510
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:03,840
# He tried to remove them all

1511
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:09,080
# And I said as I ran down the hall

1512
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:15,240
# Take back your mink

1513
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:18,040
# Take back your pearls

1514
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:20,160
# What made you think

1515
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:23,880
# That I was one of those girls?

1516
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:28,320
# Take back the gown

1517
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:31,240
# The shoes and the hat

1518
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:36,920
# I may be down But I'm not flat as all that

1519
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:41,560
# I thought that each expensive Gift you'd arranged

1520
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:44,720
# Was a token of your esteem

1521
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:49,040
# Now when I think of what you want in exchange

1522
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:55,960
# It all seems a horrible dream

1523
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:59,800
# So take back your mink

1524
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:02,680
# To from whence it came

1525
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:07,320
# And tell them to shorten the sleeves

1526
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:11,840
# For some other dame

1527
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:19,760
# Take back your mink take back your pearls

1528
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:23,920
# What made you think that I was one of those girls?

1529
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:27,440
# I'm screamin' take back the gown

1530
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:32,240
# Take back the hat I may be down

1531
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:34,800
# But I'm not flat as all that

1532
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:37,640
# I thought that each expensive gift you'd arranged

1533
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:40,240
# Was a token of your esteem

1534
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:42,960
# But when I think of what you want in exchange

1535
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:45,520
# It all seems a horrible dream

1536
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:50,640
# Oh, take back your mink those old worn-out pelts

1537
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:54,000
# And go shorten the sleeves

1538
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,600
# For somebody else

1539
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:56,800
# Well, wouldn't you? #

1540
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:11,640
I cannot do it, Sky.

1541
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:14,120
I cannot bring myself to tell miss Adelaide

1542
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:17,640
Nathan is not going to elope with her tonight.

1543
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:20,240
Nathan is what he is. She ought to know better.

1544
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:22,200
I thought the game broke up last night.

1545
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:23,720
Big Jule, being a large loser,

1546
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:25,440
is most insistent that the game goes on.

1547
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:28,200
- So we find another place, the game goes on. 
- Where?

1548
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:30,440
It's too hard to describe. I could take you there,

1549
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:32,640
but I must deliver this message first.

1550
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:34,640
I'll deliver it. Meet me outside.

1551
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:37,520
If you're looking for action, the boys are pretty tired.

1552
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:41,840
No, I'm leaving town tonight. But I gave my marker to somebody.

1553
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:44,280
I want to make it good before I leave.

1554
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:54,200
You know something, Sky? Suddenly I'm embarrassed.

1555
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:57,080
I don't know which etiquette I should use.

1556
01:44:57,080 --> 01:44:59,480
- Etiquette? 
- Your being here tonight

1557
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:02,800
must have something to do with the wedding.

1558
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:06,640
Nathan must've sent you as one of his seconds or something.

1559
01:45:06,640 --> 01:45:10,440
- Nathan didn't exactly send me. 
- Then I don't understand.

1560
01:45:10,440 --> 01:45:13,840
I'm supposed to give you a message from him.

1561
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,720
He's out there, isn't he?

1562
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:19,640
- I mean, nathan's here tonight in the Hotbox? 
- No.

1563
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:23,440
But tonight...

1564
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:26,440
Sky, we're eloping tonight.

1565
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:28,240
We're getting married tonight.

1566
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:31,080
In front of people, we talked about it.

1567
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:34,440
- Oh, Sky, he's just got to be here. 
- He isn't.

1568
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:37,280
It seems that one of nathan's close relatives...

1569
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:39,680
- er... 
- His aunt in Pittsburgh.

1570
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:44,800
- That's the one. 
- His floating aunt in Pittsburgh.

1571
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:48,640
It's the crap game again.

1572
01:45:48,640 --> 01:45:51,760
- Does it surprise you? You know Nathan. 
- He promised to change.

1573
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:53,400
Change, change. Who do you love?

1574
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:56,080
Nathan, or what you want to make out of him?

1575
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:59,440
I want to marry and live normal like people.

1576
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:02,800
I want a normal home with wallpaper and bookends.

1577
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:06,680
Then fall in love with people, not with gamblers.

1578
01:46:13,480 --> 01:46:14,920
Adelaide,

1579
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:16,840
my daddy once told me,

1580
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:20,080
"no matter who you get married to,

1581
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:22,120
you wake up married to somebody else."

1582
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:25,160
You take it the way the dice falls.

1583
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:26,920
But a guy doesn't want to feel

1584
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:29,320
he's dress material a woman cuts according

1585
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:32,680
to the way they wear husbands this year.

1586
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:37,480
It's easy for you to talk. You're not in love with Nathan.

1587
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:38,920
No, I'm not.

1588
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:44,800
Wait till you fall in love with somebody you shouldn't.

1589
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:47,080
Wait till it happens to you.

1590
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:50,160
Yeah.

1591
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:54,760
Must be tough to take.

1592
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:07,240
Sarah, I don't believe Sky had any more to do

1593
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:09,640
with what happened here last night than I did.

1594
01:47:09,640 --> 01:47:13,880
That's why you buy solid gold watches for 1.00.

1595
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:15,360
Do you believe it?

1596
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:18,440
- Whether he did... 
- Do you believe it?

1597
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:21,320
They used our mission for their crap game.

1598
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:24,240
- If Sky wasn't involved... 
- Don't you understand?

1599
01:47:24,240 --> 01:47:28,520
All I could see was him running away from the police

1600
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:30,920
with the rest of that trash.

1601
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:34,800
All I could see was he was one of them.

1602
01:47:37,160 --> 01:47:41,960
And I never saw till now how much in love with him you are.

1603
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:43,440
I'll get over it.

1604
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:45,640
Why would anyone want to get over

1605
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:48,640
the one thing you hope for from the minute you're born?

1606
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:50,080
I'll get over it.

1607
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:52,480
Why? Because it's the greatest reward

1608
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:55,400
that woman or man can have on earth?

1609
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:57,840
To love and to be loved?

1610
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:04,480
I just want to remind you,

1611
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:07,360
you hold my marker for 12 or more sinners

1612
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:10,080
- by midnight tonight. 
- Forget about it.

1613
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:12,680
I do not forget a marker.

1614
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:16,040
Well, last night the mission was filled

1615
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:17,960
with your friends.

1616
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:19,480
Let's say we're even.

1617
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:29,920
If you don't make that marker good,

1618
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:32,360
I'll buzz it all over town you're a welsher.

1619
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:46,720
Nicely, time's running out. Where's the crap game?

1620
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:48,200
A ten-minute walk.

1621
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:50,120
- Which way? 
- This way.

1622
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:03,720
Craps!

1623
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:24,880
Wait a minute. Where are you all going?

1624
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:26,840
I come here to shoot crap.

1625
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:28,240
I've had enough.

1626
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:30,640
How many days we been here?

1627
01:52:30,640 --> 01:52:34,640
As you can see Big Jule, the boys are slightly fatigued from weariness,

1628
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:37,120
having been shooting crap for quite a while now.

1629
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:38,840
Namely, 24 hours.

1630
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:42,720
I don't care who's tired. I'm out 25 Gs. Nobody leaves.

1631
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:44,440
I am half dead.

1632
01:52:44,440 --> 01:52:47,560
Shut up, or Jule will arrange the other half.

1633
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:50,160
Since I've been cleaned out of cash,

1634
01:52:50,160 --> 01:52:53,760
I announce that I will now play on credit.

1635
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:58,520
Big Jule, you cannot imagine how exhausted they are,

1636
01:52:58,520 --> 01:53:01,080
especially on a non-cash basis.

1637
01:53:01,080 --> 01:53:03,560
Me? Personally, I'm fresh as a daisy.

1638
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:05,280
Then I'll play with you.

1639
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:07,760
But I am not a player. I am merely the operator.

1640
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:09,760
You've been raking down out of every pot.

1641
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:11,520
You must have by now quite a bundle.

1642
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:14,640
Being I assume the risk, is it not fair I assume some dough?

1643
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:19,240
Detroit, I'm going to roll you, willy or nilly.

1644
01:53:19,240 --> 01:53:22,920
If I lose, I'll give you my marker.

1645
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:24,720
And if I lose?

1646
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:27,520
You will give him cash.

1647
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:31,240
- Let me hear from big Jule. 
- You'll give me cash.

1648
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:32,560
I heard.

1649
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:36,640
Here's my marker. Put up your dough.

1650
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:38,560
Anything wrong?

1651
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:41,680
"I owe you 1,000, signed X."

1652
01:53:41,680 --> 01:53:44,920
How is it you can write 1,000 but not your signature?

1653
01:53:44,920 --> 01:53:48,200
I was good in arithmetic, but I stunk in English.

1654
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:52,720
Here. This will put you through Harvard.

1655
01:53:52,720 --> 01:53:55,000
I'm rolling the whole thousand.

1656
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:02,800
And to change my luck, I'm going to use my own dice.

1657
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:04,120
Your own dice?

1658
01:54:04,120 --> 01:54:07,760
Yeah, had 'em made especially for me in Chicago.

1659
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:11,640
- I do not wish to seem petty, but may I look? 
- Here.

1660
01:54:15,080 --> 01:54:18,280
But...these dice ain't got no spots on 'em. They're blank.

1661
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:20,240
Oh, I had 'em removed for luck,

1662
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:22,680
but I remember where they formerly were.

1663
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:24,720
You are going to roll blank dice

1664
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:26,800
and remember where the spots formerly were?

1665
01:54:28,280 --> 01:54:31,680
Detroit, do you doubt my memory?

1666
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:35,160
Big Jule, I have great trust in you.

1667
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:41,520
Ha! 5 and a 5. 10. My point's 10.

1668
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:44,800
At least I got a chance. He remembered a hard point.

1669
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:47,760
Ha! ten! I win. six and a 4.

1670
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:49,480
Which is which?

1671
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:52,000
Either way. I'm rolling to 2,000.

1672
01:54:57,080 --> 01:54:59,560
Ha! 7. I win.

1673
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:02,560
I could have sworn he'd remember that one.

1674
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:07,720
Detroit, I'm gonna take it easy with you this time.

1675
01:55:07,720 --> 01:55:09,640
I'm shooting 1.00.

1676
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:13,200
I'll cover all of it.

1677
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:19,360
Ha! How do you like that? Snake eyes. I lose.

1678
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:23,240
I won't even bother picking it up. Benny, pick it up.

1679
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:25,640
Here's your chance to get even.

1680
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:27,360
I'm rolling three Gs.

1681
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:30,600
Three Gs? But that's my whole bankroll.

1682
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:32,600
Three Gs. Get it up.

1683
01:55:34,240 --> 01:55:36,720
Well, here we go...

1684
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:39,080
Down memory lane.

1685
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:46,760
Ha! Lucky me. 11. I win.

1686
01:55:46,760 --> 01:55:48,400
I'm clean.

1687
01:55:49,480 --> 01:55:52,320
Seeing that I'm on a lucky streak,

1688
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:55,800
I will now roll the rest of you guys.

1689
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:57,240
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1690
01:55:57,240 --> 01:55:59,360
You have got to give me a chance to get even.

1691
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:01,280
I will now roll you with my dice.

1692
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:02,920
What are you gonna use for money?

1693
01:56:02,920 --> 01:56:05,440
I will give you my marker.

1694
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:09,120
And against your marker, big Jule puts up cash?

1695
01:56:09,120 --> 01:56:12,480
- Nathan done it. - Yeah. What is this anyway?

1696
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:13,920
Take it easy, Nathan.

1697
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:15,360
Him and his no-spot dice.

1698
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:18,240
Somebody ought to knock the spots off of him.

1699
01:56:18,240 --> 01:56:20,800
Nathan, do not make big Jule have to do something to you.

1700
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:23,760
Detroit, I'm on vacation. Don't louse it up.

1701
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:27,440
What could you do me? Shoot me? Put me in cement?

1702
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:29,560
At least I would know where I am.

1703
01:56:29,560 --> 01:56:31,960
Here I risked my neck to set up this crap game,

1704
01:56:31,960 --> 01:56:33,880
even promised to get married.

1705
01:56:33,880 --> 01:56:36,880
And where do I wind up? Broke. In a sewer.

1706
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:38,960
Believe me, my tough friend from Chicago,

1707
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:41,480
there's nothing you could do that would not cheer me up.

1708
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:43,320
NICELY NICELY: Here they are.

1709
01:56:44,920 --> 01:56:47,320
And how is everybody down here?

1710
01:56:47,320 --> 01:56:50,560
Ah! I smell fresh blood. Looking for some action?

1711
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:53,840
Not at the moment. I just came underground to talk to some of my friends.

1712
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:55,760
We ain't talkin', we're shooting crap.

1713
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:58,120
- It'll only take a minute. 
- We're shooting crap.

1714
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:03,960
Gentlemen, I would like to talk to you about Sarah Brown's mission

1715
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:06,480
where you were so rudely interrupted last night.

1716
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:10,760
What kind of characters walk around the sewers of New York? Who is this joker?

1717
01:57:10,760 --> 01:57:15,080
He is the guy who's trying to take the mission doll to Havana.

1718
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:17,200
Oh, him.

1719
01:57:17,200 --> 01:57:19,200
I suggest you return to where you came,

1720
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:20,840
back to your praying tomato.

1721
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:23,520
Around here your presence is slowing up the action.

1722
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:25,720
If you are so eager for action,

1723
01:57:25,720 --> 01:57:28,720
care to make a small wager on a proposition?

1724
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:30,720
Pray tell, what's the proposition?

1725
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:33,040
An old one my daddy taught me.

1726
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:36,360
Now, am I right-handed or left-handed?

1727
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:38,320
Now, how would I know?

1728
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:40,240
I'll give you a clue.

1729
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:52,120
Give me that gu...

1730
01:57:52,120 --> 01:57:55,720
Now, to continue with what I was talking about.

1731
01:57:55,720 --> 01:57:59,560
Tonight Miss Sarah's holding a midnight prayer meeting.

1732
01:57:59,560 --> 01:58:02,320
I promised to supply that meeting with some sinners.

1733
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:04,680
Now when it comes to sinners,

1734
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:08,160
no sewer anywhere could provide such a congregation.

1735
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:15,880
I would consider it a very great personal favour.

1736
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:19,520
I ain't spending no time in no hallelujah joint.

1737
01:58:21,120 --> 01:58:23,960
If not as a favour to me, how about as a favour to yourselves?

1738
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:28,520
I guarantee you the air in the mission smells cleaner than it does down here.

1739
01:58:28,520 --> 01:58:29,800
Rusty Charlie?

1740
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:32,400
Society Max?

1741
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:36,800
If anybody else would go, I would also go, Sky,

1742
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:38,720
but you know me, I'd go anywhere.

1743
01:58:38,720 --> 01:58:42,280
Well, thanks, Nathan, but just you alone is not enough.

1744
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:46,480
Well, I tried.

1745
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:49,040
Uh, Sky...

1746
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:51,160
about that Havana business.

1747
01:58:51,160 --> 01:58:53,560
I regret I temporarily do not have

1748
01:58:53,560 --> 01:58:55,280
the 1,000 to pay you.

1749
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:59,400
I'm glad you reminded me, Nathan. You won the bet.

1750
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:05,160
But I thought you took Miss Sarah to Havana. You thought wrong.

1751
01:59:07,120 --> 01:59:10,560
On your feet, big Jule. I'll roll you again.

1752
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:12,440
This time with real dice.

1753
01:59:12,440 --> 01:59:13,880
Nothin' doin'. With honest dice,

1754
01:59:13,880 --> 01:59:16,800
big Jule cannot make a pass to save his soul.

1755
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:18,240
What did you say?

1756
01:59:18,240 --> 01:59:22,520
I only said that with real dice, big Jule cannot make a pass to save his soul.

1757
01:59:22,520 --> 01:59:25,320
That's very interesting.

1758
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:27,480
Maybe with honest dice,

1759
01:59:27,480 --> 01:59:30,680
I can make a pass to save his soul.

1760
01:59:30,680 --> 01:59:33,920
And yours. And yours and yours.

1761
01:59:35,200 --> 01:59:37,720
I'm gonna roll these dice.

1762
01:59:37,720 --> 01:59:39,160
One roll,

1763
01:59:39,160 --> 01:59:42,960
and I'll bet each of you 1,000 against your soul.

1764
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:47,720
1,000 cash against a marker for your soul.

1765
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:52,200
If I win, all of you show at the mission tonight. Have I got a bet?

1766
01:59:52,200 --> 01:59:53,840
ALL TALK AT ONCE

1767
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:55,400
Let me get this.

1768
01:59:55,400 --> 01:59:56,880
If you lose,

1769
01:59:56,880 --> 01:59:59,760
you got to give us each 1,000 bucks.

1770
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:03,760
If you win, then we all show up at the mission doll's cabaret?

1771
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:06,400
Save-a-soul mission, midnight tonight. One meeting.

1772
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:08,120
If you lose, 1,000 apiece?

1773
02:00:08,120 --> 02:00:09,800
1,000 apiece.

1774
02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:12,800
- That's OK by me. 
- What have I got to lose?

1775
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:22,280
What's the delay, Sky? You turning chicken?

1776
02:00:22,280 --> 02:00:24,320
You know better than that, Horse.

1777
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:26,760
You've seen me roll for twice as much.

1778
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:35,800
Only I got a lot more than money riding on this one.

1779
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:42,440
# They call you

1780
02:00:42,440 --> 02:00:44,800
# Lady luck

1781
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:48,040
# But there is room for doubt

1782
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:53,280
# At times you have A very unladylike way

1783
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:55,720
# Of runnin' out

1784
02:00:55,720 --> 02:00:59,640
# You're on this date with me

1785
02:00:59,640 --> 02:01:03,400
# The pickings have been lush

1786
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:08,240
# And yet before This evening is over you might

1787
02:01:08,240 --> 02:01:12,520
# Give me the brush You might forget your manners

1788
02:01:12,520 --> 02:01:16,000
# You might refuse to stay

1789
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:20,760
# And so the best That I can do

1790
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:23,320
# Is pray

1791
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:27,720
# Luck, be a lady tonight

1792
02:01:27,720 --> 02:01:30,440
# Luck, be a lady tonight

1793
02:01:30,440 --> 02:01:34,200
# Luck, if you've ever Been a lady to begin with

1794
02:01:34,200 --> 02:01:38,440
# Luck, be a lady tonight

1795
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:41,720
# Luck, let a gentleman see

1796
02:01:41,720 --> 02:01:44,440
# How nice a dame you can be

1797
02:01:44,440 --> 02:01:47,880
# I know the way you've treated Other guys you've been with

1798
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:51,920
# Luck, be a lady with me

1799
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:55,360
# A lady doesn't leave her escort

1800
02:01:55,360 --> 02:01:58,360
# It isn't fair It isn't nice

1801
02:01:58,360 --> 02:02:01,360
# A lady doesn't wander all over the room

1802
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:04,120
# And blow on some other guy's dice

1803
02:02:04,120 --> 02:02:10,600
# So let's keep the party polite Never get out of my sight

1804
02:02:10,600 --> 02:02:13,560
# Stick with me, baby I'm the fella you came in with

1805
02:02:13,560 --> 02:02:16,040
# Luck, be a lady

1806
02:02:16,040 --> 02:02:19,160
# Luck, be a lady

1807
02:02:19,160 --> 02:02:21,680
# Luck, be a lady tonight

1808
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:53,360
# A lady wouldn't flirt with strangers

1809
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:56,720
# She'd have a heart She'd have a soul

1810
02:02:56,720 --> 02:02:59,600
# A lady wouldn't make Little snake eyes at me

1811
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:02,480
# When I bet my life on this roll

1812
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:06,120
- # So let's keep the party polite 
- Why don't he shoot?

1813
02:03:06,120 --> 02:03:09,000
- # Never get out of my sight 
- Come on, quit stallin'

1814
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,400
# Stick with me, baby I'm the fella you came in with

1815
02:03:11,400 --> 02:03:14,760
- # Luck, be a lady 
- Sky's turnin' yellow

1816
02:03:14,760 --> 02:03:17,360
- # Luck, be a lady 
- What are you scared of?

1817
02:03:17,360 --> 02:03:20,320
# Luck, be a lady

1818
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:25,520
- # Tonight 
- Comin' out, comin' out. #

1819
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:27,200
ALL: Ha!

1820
02:03:30,760 --> 02:03:33,160
I tell ya, I don't wanna go.

1821
02:03:33,160 --> 02:03:35,560
But, big Jule, you give your marker.

1822
02:03:35,560 --> 02:03:38,400
If you welsh, this will cause me no little embarrassment.

1823
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:41,280
I am sure you do not want to cause me embarrassment.

1824
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:43,680
Well, if it ever gets back to Chicago

1825
02:03:43,680 --> 02:03:49,000
that I went to a prayer meeting, no decent person will talk to me.

1826
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:01,440
Oop.

1827
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:02,560
Adelaide!

1828
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:06,400
How clumsy of me. So sorry. An awkward coincidence.

1829
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:07,840
Adelaide, listen.

1830
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:10,960
I sent Nicely especially to explain about tonight.

1831
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:13,080
If you knew what I've been through...

1832
02:04:13,080 --> 02:04:16,720
Please. Let us not have a vulgar scene.

1833
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:21,360
After all, we're civilised people. We do not have to conduct ourselves like a slob.

1834
02:04:24,160 --> 02:04:27,160
Adelaide, what is this? How can you be so upset

1835
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:29,560
over one lousy elopement?

1836
02:04:29,560 --> 02:04:31,480
I am not upset.

1837
02:04:31,480 --> 02:04:34,800
I have succeeded in your not being able to upset me no more.

1838
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:37,120
I have got you completely out of my...

1839
02:04:38,360 --> 02:04:39,760
Ah-choo!

1840
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:41,080
Gesundheit.

1841
02:04:41,080 --> 02:04:42,200
..System.

1842
02:04:44,240 --> 02:04:46,200
Oh, Nathan!

1843
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:47,760
SHE SOBS

1844
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:50,960
Adelaide, baby, don't do that to me.

1845
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:53,840
I can't stand it when you cry.

1846
02:04:53,840 --> 02:04:56,720
Look. We'll get married. I promise you.

1847
02:04:56,720 --> 02:04:59,240
We'll have what you always wanted...

1848
02:04:59,240 --> 02:05:01,960
A little white house with a green fence,

1849
02:05:01,960 --> 02:05:03,920
just like the Whitney colours.

1850
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:08,720
Oh, Nathan, if I could only believe you.

1851
02:05:08,720 --> 02:05:11,560
We could still make everything all right.

1852
02:05:11,560 --> 02:05:15,480
- We could elope right now. 
- Adelaide, could we?

1853
02:05:21,320 --> 02:05:24,520
- I almost forgot. But right at this time I cannot. 
- Why not?

1854
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:28,200
I'm gonna tell you the truth, but you will not believe me.

1855
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:30,280
Nathan, why can't we elope?

1856
02:05:30,280 --> 02:05:33,160
I have to go to a prayer meeting.

1857
02:05:33,160 --> 02:05:36,840
That is the biggest and most unforgivable lie you've ever told me!

1858
02:05:36,840 --> 02:05:38,920
It's true! I promise you.

1859
02:05:38,920 --> 02:05:40,680
# You promise me this you promise me that

1860
02:05:40,680 --> 02:05:42,520
# You promise me everything under the sun

1861
02:05:42,520 --> 02:05:44,720
# But you give me a kiss And you're grabbin' your hat

1862
02:05:44,720 --> 02:05:46,840
# And you're off to the races again

1863
02:05:46,840 --> 02:05:49,960
- # When I think of the time gone by 
- Adelaide...

1864
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:51,920
- # And I think of the way I tried 
- Adelaide...

1865
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:55,320
# I could honestly die

1866
02:05:56,480 --> 02:06:01,240
# Call a lawyer and sue me Sue me

1867
02:06:01,240 --> 02:06:05,760

# Go ahead, hate me, I love you

1870

# The best years of my life I was a fool to give to you

1871
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:18,080
# All right, already I'm just a no-goodnik

1872
02:06:18,080 --> 02:06:20,680
# All right, already It's true

1873
02:06:20,680 --> 02:06:25,400
# So nu So sue me, sue me

1874

# What can you do me? I love you

# But you gamble it here you gamble it there

1876
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:33,880
# You gamble on everything all except me

1877
02:06:33,880 --> 02:06:35,840
# And I'm sick of you keeping me up in the air

1878
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:38,960
# Till you're back in the money again When I think of the time gone by

1879
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:42,280
- # Adelaide... 
- And I think of the way I tried

1880
02:06:42,280 --> 02:06:47,000
- # Adelaide...

1881
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,440
SHE CRIES

02:06:55,480 --> 02:07:01,360
# Serve a paper and sue me Sue me

Ah-choo!

# Give a holler and hate me Hate me

1886
02:07:09,200 --> 02:07:12,480
- # Go ahead, hate me, I love you 
- When you wind up in jail

1887
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:15,320
# Don't come to me to bail you out

1888
02:07:15,320 --> 02:07:18,080
# All right, already So call a policeman

1889
02:07:18,080 --> 02:07:21,840
# All right, already It's true, so nu

1890
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:25,880
# So sue me, sue me

1891
02:07:25,880 --> 02:07:33,320
# What can you do me? I love you

1892
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:37,520
# You're at it again You're running the game

1893
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:39,280
# I'm not gonna play second fiddle to that

1894
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:41,280
# I'm sick and I'm tired of stalling around

1895
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:43,240
# I'm telling you now that we're through

1896
02:07:43,240 --> 02:07:45,520
# When I think of the time gone by

1897
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:49,000
- # And I think of the way I tried 
- Adelaide!

1898
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:53,000
# I could honestly die

1899
02:07:54,920 --> 02:07:58,480
# Sue me Sue me

1900
02:07:58,480 --> 02:08:01,960
# Shoot bullets through me

1901
02:08:01,960 --> 02:08:09,960
# I love you! #

1902
02:08:15,240 --> 02:08:16,960
Ah-choo!

1903
02:08:24,080 --> 02:08:26,280
According to my wrist chronometer,

1904
02:08:26,280 --> 02:08:28,160
it's well past midnight.

1905
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:30,120
It seems to me that if this big meeting

1906
02:08:30,120 --> 02:08:32,040
were going to be as big as you'd hoped,

1907
02:08:32,040 --> 02:08:33,480
by now, somebody...

1908
02:08:33,480 --> 02:08:34,920
you're quite right, General.

1909
02:08:34,920 --> 02:08:37,440
- Sarah. 
- Why keep pretending?

1910
02:08:37,440 --> 02:08:40,800
It's childish of us to think we could make sinners appear

1911
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:42,240
for this big meeting

1912
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:44,760
when we've failed so miserably up to now.

1913
02:08:44,760 --> 02:08:48,040
When I say we, I mean I failed.

1914
02:08:53,120 --> 02:08:56,480
Welcome, brothers! Welcome! Come in. Come in.

1915
02:08:56,480 --> 02:09:00,640
Come on. Move in. Move in, everybody. Hats off.

1916
02:09:00,640 --> 02:09:03,040
Step along. You, too, big Jule.

1917
02:09:03,040 --> 02:09:05,320
Move it. Come on, kid.

1918
02:09:08,480 --> 02:09:10,280
Keep moving. Come on.

1919
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:16,120
Is everybody accounted for?

1920
02:09:17,080 --> 02:09:21,000
- Where's Nathan Detroit? 
- Present. 
- All right.

1921
02:09:27,480 --> 02:09:31,800
Well, I made good my marker. I ought to ask you to return it,

1922
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:34,680
but it would break up your pretty set of thoughts for today.

1923
02:09:34,680 --> 02:09:38,040
When you get around to it, mark it "paid in full."

1924
02:09:38,040 --> 02:09:39,960
Would you gentlemen sit down?

1925
02:09:39,960 --> 02:09:41,600
Sit down. Do as you're told!

1926
02:09:48,440 --> 02:09:53,040
On behalf of General Cartwright, Sergeant Sarah Brown, and the rest of us...

1927
02:09:53,040 --> 02:09:54,480
The army's certainly changed.

1928
02:09:54,480 --> 02:09:57,840
In the next war, I wanna be a red cross nurse.

1929
02:09:57,840 --> 02:09:59,920
- LAUGHTER 
- Quiet! Quiet!

1930
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:01,440
I remind you, gentlemen,

1931
02:10:01,440 --> 02:10:04,320
you're no longer on your knees in a sewer,

1932
02:10:04,320 --> 02:10:06,240
but sitting in a mission.

1933
02:10:06,240 --> 02:10:08,640
I trust there will be no further unpleasantness.

1934
02:10:08,640 --> 02:10:11,520
Now, since I depart to move on to other places,

1935
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:14,920
I'm appointing Nathan Detroit as my deputy.

1936
02:10:14,920 --> 02:10:17,120
Nathan, I hand you herewith their markers

1937
02:10:17,120 --> 02:10:19,160
to be returned when they are made good.

1938
02:10:19,160 --> 02:10:21,280
And anybody who does not play out this hand

1939
02:10:21,280 --> 02:10:23,960
strictly according to Hoyle, will answer to me personally.

1940
02:10:23,960 --> 02:10:26,040
And that means in person.

1941
02:10:30,480 --> 02:10:32,600
What a remarkable young man.

1942
02:10:36,400 --> 02:10:40,240
I will add nothin' to what Sky said except to say that there are many here

1943
02:10:40,240 --> 02:10:45,320
upon who, if they get out of line, I would squeal with pleasure.

1944
02:10:45,320 --> 02:10:47,600
Brother Arvide, your dice.

1945
02:10:50,280 --> 02:10:53,200
Gentlemen, our meeting tonight will be conducted

1946
02:10:53,200 --> 02:10:56,040
by the regional director of the Save-a-soul mission,

1947
02:10:56,040 --> 02:10:57,440
General Cartwright.

1948
02:11:01,880 --> 02:11:06,200
I have rarely attended a meeting in any of our branches

1949
02:11:06,200 --> 02:11:09,520
which could boast of so many evil-looking sinners.

1950
02:11:11,160 --> 02:11:13,040
Now, surely your hearts must be heavy

1951
02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:14,880
with sins to which you want to confess.

1952
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:18,240
Who will be the first to give testimony?

1953
02:11:18,240 --> 02:11:20,840
Benny Southstreet, give testimony.

1954
02:11:20,840 --> 02:11:22,920
I plead the fifth commandment.

1955
02:11:22,920 --> 02:11:25,800
Come, brothers, we know how difficult it is.

1956
02:11:25,800 --> 02:11:29,280
But if one of you will open his heart, the others will follow.

1957
02:11:29,280 --> 02:11:33,480
Benny, this is an order. Tell the people what a bum you are.

1958
02:11:36,400 --> 02:11:39,800
Well, I was always a bad guy.

1959
02:11:39,800 --> 02:11:41,760
I was even a bad gambler.

1960
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:44,680
I would like to be a good guy and a good gambler.

1961
02:11:44,680 --> 02:11:46,080
I thank you.

1962
02:11:46,080 --> 02:11:48,000
Who will be next?

1963
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:49,640
Big Jule.

1964
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:51,560
What's the pitch?

1965
02:11:51,560 --> 02:11:54,440
Tell the people all the terrible things you've done,

1966
02:11:54,440 --> 02:11:58,280
but ain't gonna do no more. And watch your language.

1967
02:11:59,320 --> 02:12:03,800
Well, I used to be bad when I was a kid.

1968
02:12:03,800 --> 02:12:05,920
But ever since then, I've gone straight,

1969
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:11,640
as you can prove by my record - 33 arrests and no convictions.

1970
02:12:13,640 --> 02:12:15,560
- Horse. 
- No!

1971
02:12:15,560 --> 02:12:18,560
- Harry the horse. - Go ahead. Go ahead.

1972
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:24,320
Well, when Sky was rolling us against our souls...

1973
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:25,720
I beg your pardon?

1974
02:12:25,720 --> 02:12:29,080
Sky Masterson - he rolled us 1,000 against our souls.

1975
02:12:29,080 --> 02:12:31,480
- That's why we're here. 
- I don't understand.

1976
02:12:31,480 --> 02:12:33,240
I'll interpret for you.

1977
02:12:33,240 --> 02:12:36,120
He means they're here only because Sky Masterson

1978
02:12:36,120 --> 02:12:39,200
won them in a dice game.

1979
02:12:39,200 --> 02:12:42,040
Then this whole meeting, in a way,

1980
02:12:42,040 --> 02:12:44,440
is the result of gambling.

1981
02:12:44,440 --> 02:12:46,400
Fire fought with fire.

1982
02:12:46,400 --> 02:12:49,440
Sergeant Sarah, you are to be congratulated.

1983
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:51,440
Congratulations, Sarah!

1984
02:12:53,600 --> 02:12:54,880
Thank you so much.

1985
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:57,440
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1986
02:12:57,440 --> 02:13:00,320
I ain't finished my testimony yet.

1987
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:04,600
So my sin is that when Sky was rolling us,

1988
02:13:04,600 --> 02:13:09,880
I wished that I could win the 1,000 instead of having to come here.

1989
02:13:09,880 --> 02:13:12,880
Now that I'm here... I still wish it!

1990
02:13:15,640 --> 02:13:18,280
Something very funny has been happening to me,

1991
02:13:18,280 --> 02:13:21,920
sitting here, I mean. Like I'm remembering a dream.

1992
02:13:23,960 --> 02:13:25,120
You...

1993
02:13:27,640 --> 02:13:30,320
Tell us, Nicely. Tell us in your own words.

1994
02:13:31,640 --> 02:13:34,240
NICELY: Yeah, that's it - a dream.

1995
02:13:34,240 --> 02:13:36,320
# I dreamed last night

1996
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:38,640
# I got on the boat to heaven

1997
02:13:38,640 --> 02:13:42,360
# And by some chance I had brought my dice along

1998
02:13:42,360 --> 02:13:46,040
# And there I stood And I hollered, someone, fade me

1999
02:13:46,040 --> 02:13:52,600
# But the passengers They knew right from wrong

2000
02:13:52,600 --> 02:13:56,280
# For the people all said sit down Sit down, you're rockin' the boat

2001
02:13:56,280 --> 02:13:58,880
# People all said sit down Sit down, you're rockin' the boat

2002
02:13:58,880 --> 02:14:00,880
# And the devil will drag you under

2003
02:14:00,880 --> 02:14:03,120
# By the sharp lapel of your checkered coat

2004
02:14:03,120 --> 02:14:04,840
# Sit down, sit down, sit down,

2005
02:14:04,840 --> 02:14:07,240
# Sit down, sit down, you're rockin' the boat

2006
02:14:09,240 --> 02:14:12,480
# I sailed away On that little boat to heaven

2007
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:15,760
# And by some chance Found a bottle in my fist

2008
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:19,440
# And there I stood Nicely passing out the whiskey

2009
02:14:19,440 --> 02:14:25,680
# But the passengers were bound to resist

2010
02:14:25,680 --> 02:14:29,240
# For the people all said Beware, you're on a heavenly trip

2011
02:14:29,240 --> 02:14:32,440
# People all said, beware Beware, you'll scuttle the ship

2012
02:14:32,440 --> 02:14:33,920
# And the devil will drag you under

2013
02:14:33,920 --> 02:14:35,680
# By the fancy tie round your wicked throat

2014
02:14:35,680 --> 02:14:37,360
# Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down

2015
02:14:37,360 --> 02:14:39,720
# Sit down, you're rockin' the boat

2016
02:14:39,720 --> 02:14:41,520
# And as I laughed

2017
02:14:41,520 --> 02:14:43,440
# At those passengers to heaven

2018
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:45,000
# Ha ha ha ha!

2019
02:14:46,120 --> 02:14:49,080
# A great big wave came And washed me overboard

2020
02:14:49,080 --> 02:14:52,840
# And as I sank And I hollered, someone save me

2021
02:14:52,840 --> 02:14:55,720
# That's the moment I woke up

2022
02:14:55,720 --> 02:14:59,160
- # Thank the lord 
- ALL: Thank the lord

2023
02:14:59,160 --> 02:15:02,400
ALL: # Thank the lord

2024
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:05,880
# And I said to myself, sit down Sit down, you're rockin' the boat

2025
02:15:05,880 --> 02:15:08,920
# Said to myself sit down Sit down, you're rockin' the boat

2026
02:15:08,920 --> 02:15:10,600
# And the devil will drag you under

2027
02:15:10,600 --> 02:15:12,360
# With a soul so heavy you'd never float

2028
02:15:12,360 --> 02:15:13,800
# Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down

2029
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:16,080
# Sit down, you're rockin' the boat Sit down, you're rockin'

2030
02:15:16,080 --> 02:15:18,160
# Sit down, sit down, sit down you're rockin' the boat

2031
02:15:18,160 --> 02:15:19,240
# Sit down, you're rockin'

2032
02:15:19,240 --> 02:15:22,200
# Sit down, sit down, sit down, you're rockin' the boat

2033
02:15:22,200 --> 02:15:27,280
- # Sit down 
- ALL: # You're rockin' the boat. #

2034
02:15:36,760 --> 02:15:40,040
Now, Brother Brannigan, What can we do for you?

2035
02:15:40,040 --> 02:15:41,960
Maybe you would like to testify?

2036
02:15:41,960 --> 02:15:44,360
I'll do my testifying in court,

2037
02:15:44,360 --> 02:15:46,240
where I will testify you ran a crap game

2038
02:15:46,240 --> 02:15:48,200
here in the mission last night.

2039
02:15:48,200 --> 02:15:51,640
A crap game! In the mission?

2040
02:15:51,640 --> 02:15:54,400
Miss Sarah, you were standing right there

2041
02:15:54,400 --> 02:15:57,480
when they ran out. You saw them. Aren't these the men?

2042
02:16:05,240 --> 02:16:07,880
You must be mistaken, lieutenant.

2043
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:12,160
I never saw these gentlemen before in my life.

2044
02:16:14,040 --> 02:16:16,240
- BIG JULE: 
- There's a right broad.

2045
02:16:16,240 --> 02:16:21,080
If you'll excuse us, lieutenant, we'd like to go on with our meeting.

2046
02:16:27,960 --> 02:16:29,400
Tell me something.

2047
02:16:29,400 --> 02:16:31,640
Is my name Brannigan?

2048
02:16:31,640 --> 02:16:33,720
When last seen.

2049
02:16:33,720 --> 02:16:37,440
Thanks. I was beginning to wonder.

2050
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:47,840
On behalf of everybody concerned, thanks, Miss Sarah.

2051
02:16:47,840 --> 02:16:49,240
Also at this time,

2052
02:16:49,240 --> 02:16:52,160
I would like to personally make a confession.

2053
02:16:52,160 --> 02:16:55,040
General, we did shoot crap here last night,

2054
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:57,840
but unbeknownst to anybody connected with the mission.

2055
02:16:57,840 --> 02:17:01,760
And for this, we're all sorry. Ain't we, boys?

2056
02:17:03,240 --> 02:17:04,600
Ain't we, boys?

2057
02:17:04,600 --> 02:17:08,000
- ALL: Yeah. Sure. Oh, yeah. 
- I'm really sorry.

2058
02:17:09,040 --> 02:17:12,920
I did another terrible thing. I bet a certain guy

2059
02:17:12,920 --> 02:17:15,840
that he could not take a certain doll away with him to Havana.

2060
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:17,840
I know this I should not have done,

2061
02:17:17,840 --> 02:17:22,520
although it did not do no harm because, well, I won the bet.

2062
02:17:22,520 --> 02:17:24,600
You won the bet?

2063
02:17:24,600 --> 02:17:28,160
Sure. The guy told me he did not take the doll away.

2064
02:17:28,160 --> 02:17:31,320
And for this I feel much better.

2065
02:17:32,640 --> 02:17:36,240
- CARTWRIGHT: 
- Gentlemen, we will now sing number 244,

2066
02:17:36,240 --> 02:17:40,120
'Follow the Fold.' You will find it on page 27.

2067
02:17:46,360 --> 02:17:50,440
# Follow the fold and stray no more

2068
02:17:50,440 --> 02:17:52,240
# Stray no more

2069
02:17:52,240 --> 02:17:54,440
# Stray no more

2070
02:17:54,440 --> 02:17:58,360
# Put down the bottle and we'll say no more

2071
02:17:58,360 --> 02:18:02,200
# Follow, follow the fold. #

2072
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:49,400
Brothers and sisters, as you all know,

2073
02:20:49,400 --> 02:20:51,480
traffic is very heavy this time of night,

2074
02:20:51,480 --> 02:20:54,320
so my ceremony will be brief.

2075
02:20:55,560 --> 02:20:58,440
Do you, Sarah Brown, take Sky Masterson

2076
02:20:58,440 --> 02:21:01,480
- to be your wedded husband? 
- I do.

2077
02:21:01,480 --> 02:21:04,200
Do you, Sky Masterson, take Sarah Brown

2078
02:21:04,200 --> 02:21:07,240
- to be your wedded wife? 
- I do.

2079
02:21:07,240 --> 02:21:09,960
Do you, Miss Adelaide, take Nathan Detroit

2080
02:21:09,960 --> 02:21:13,000
- to be your wedded husband? 
- I do.

2081
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:17,680
Do you, Nathan Detroit, take Miss Adelaide to be your wedded wife?

2082
02:21:19,560 --> 02:21:22,560
- - Ah-choo! 
- That means he does. 
- - He's gotta say it.

2083
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:23,800
I do.

2084
02:21:23,800 --> 02:21:25,280
Under the authority granted me

2085
02:21:25,280 --> 02:21:27,680
by the state, county, and city of New York,

2086
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:30,680
I hereby pronounce you men and wives!

2087
02:21:30,680 --> 02:21:34,240
CHEERING

2088
02:21:53,960 --> 02:21:55,800
# When you see a guy

2089
02:21:55,800 --> 02:21:57,720
# Reach for stars in the sky

2090
02:21:57,720 --> 02:22:01,720
# You can bet That he's doing it for some doll

2091
02:22:01,720 --> 02:22:05,960
# When you spot a John Waiting out in the rain

2092
02:22:05,960 --> 02:22:10,080
# Chances are he's insane As only a John can be for a Jane

2093
02:22:10,080 --> 02:22:13,840
# When you meet a Gent Paying all kinds of rent

2094
02:22:13,840 --> 02:22:19,200
# For a flat That could flatten The Taj Mahal

2095
02:22:22,240 --> 02:22:25,000
# Call it sad, call it funny

2096
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:28,760
# But it's better than even money

2097
02:22:28,760 --> 02:22:33,120
# That the guy's only doing it

2098
02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:38,440
# For some doll. #
