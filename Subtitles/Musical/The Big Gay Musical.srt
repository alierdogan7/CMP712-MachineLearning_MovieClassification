1
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:17,340
Do I look fat?

2
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:23,588
I'm serious.

3
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,758
Do l?

4
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:29,628
Yes.
Yes, you look fat.

5
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,294
As big as a house.

6
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,094
I cannot believe you just said that.

7
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:39,165
And here I am, carrying your baby.

8
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,138
How do I know it's my baby?

9
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:46,176
Do you know what your problem is?

10
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,214
You've got a chip on your shoulder.

11
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,208
Yes.

12
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:52,578
Just can't.

13
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:54,310
And it's as big as a boulder.

14
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:57,149
I can't take it.
I can't take it, excuse me.

15
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,655
Excuse me, excuse me.

16
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:01,755
Excuse me.

17
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:05,297
Sir, are you okay?
Is there anything you need?

18
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:08,626
Yes.
I need a musical.

19
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:10,397
A BlG

20
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:11,627
GAY

21
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,271
MUSlCAL!

22
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,809
I love being OFF Broadway!

23
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:57,475
Ladies and gentleman,

24
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:00,312
welcome to the first preview
of "Adam and Steve -

25
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,647
Just the Way God Made 'Em."

26
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:04,313
Before the show begins,

27
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,120
we need to let you know that
the show was rated "FLAMlNG"

28
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:09,627
by the Coalition of Christians.

29
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,130
But that doesn't mean it's
about homosexuals.

30
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,698
It just means, that if
you enjoy this show,

31
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,631
you'll end up burning in
hell, right next to us.

32
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:20,305
[Applause]

33
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,302
Hi!
I'm Adam.

34
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,309
And I'm his husband, Steven.

35
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,107
And this is our story.

36
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,779
In the beginning,

37
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,948
God created the Heavens and the Earth.

38
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:34,778
Wait a minute!

39
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:37,179
That's not how it's supposed to begin.
You grabbed the wrong book.

40
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,482
Sorry.

41
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:45,793
In the beginning,

42
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,326
God was... bored.

43
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,400
He was all alone in the universe,

44
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,501
and the thought of
being alone forever bothered Him.

45
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:56,573
He realized what he needed were
beautiful beings to entertain Him.

46
00:02:56,776 --> 00:03:00,303
So, God created the angels.

47
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,251
And they were hot.

48
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,912
Each angel was hot...
and sexy...

49
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,686
and male.

50
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,502
God loved the angels, but soon
realized that He wanted more.

51
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,475
So, God created the Earth.

52
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:18,256
? He made the Earth full
ofbeauty and wonder. ?

53
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:28,666
? He made the skyfull
of stars like no one could. ?

54
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:38,341
? He made the oceans
and rivers and mountains. ?

55
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:42,344
? And He knew ?

56
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:46,484
? it was good. ?

57
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:51,487
? One day God came down to Earth
and summoned all His might. ?

58
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:55,660
? He took one look at
the darkness and said ?

59
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,788
Why the fuck is it
so dark down here?

60
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:01,595
Oh, that's better.

61
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,333
Aren 't they great?

62
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,401
Let's show 'em angels!

63
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:09,831
? It's God.
He's the one creator. ?

64
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:13,568
? It's God.
He's the entertainer. ?

65
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,544
? It's God.
He's the great orator. ?

66
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,684
? It's God.
He's the mastur... ?

67
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:20,682
[Gasp]

68
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,718
What?
He is the master.

69
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,620
? I am God. ?

70
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,458
? I created the plants
and the trees. ?

71
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:36,294
? I made all the animals -
the birds and the bees. ?

72
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,494
? I made everything that you see, ?

73
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:42,573
? but none of it satisfied me. ?

74
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:45,769
? I needed interaction and drama. ?

75
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,481
? I needed something
entertaining to see. ?

76
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,041
? I loved all the stuff
that I created, ?

77
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,718
? but it's like a nature show on TV.. ?

78
00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:59,989
So God created a man.

79
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,857
Adam was just what God wanted.

80
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,857
A man to do the gardening,

81
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:10,535
take care of the animals.

82
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,533
But, Adam was lonely.

83
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,900
And, God wasn't very fond of what
Adam was doing with the animals.

84
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,671
[Baa...]

85
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:23,338
So God created Eve, a woman for Adam.

86
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,486
And they were happy.

87
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:35,685
For a while.

88
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,487
You couldn't even make
me something to eat?

89
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,392
Don't you start with me!

90
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:42,998
But the shit hit the fan when
they ate God's favorite fruit.

91
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,598
Here!
Eat this.

92
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,845
Jesus Christ!

93
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:53,943
Yes daddy?

94
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,615
Nothing.
Go back to bed.

95
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,779
It wasn't my fault. I swear.

96
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:02,511
It was a serpent.

97
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,747
Yeah, a serpent.

98
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:09,860
? And so I threw them both
out of my garden. ?

99
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:13,057
? What else was there for me to do? ?

100
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,158
? But then the garden
just seemed so empty, ?

101
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:20,699
? and I was depressed
and I was so blue. ?

102
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,842
Hey God.
Why don 't you try two men?

103
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:27,043
What the hell!
Let's try it!

104
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:32,415
? I made another Adam for my garden, ?

105
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,852
? but I didn't make another Eve. ?

106
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:39,752
? I made another man
a bit more sensitive, ?

107
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:47,694
? and I called him Steve! ?

108
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:53,895
? And that is how it all began, ?

109
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:58,634
? the story of Adam and Steve. ?

110
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:03,111
? Though it's not written
in the Bible, ?

111
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:08,146
? it's the truth from
above so believe. ?

112
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:15,687
? And now here's Adam and Steve. ?

113
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:20,855
? God bless Adam and Steve. ?

114
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,565
Just the way I made 'em!

115
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,096
Really good show guys.

116
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,899
Yeah, for a first preview, it
was actually pretty good.

117
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:29,369
Where are you rushing off to?

118
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,600
I don't do stage doors.

119
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:31,741
What do you mean?

120
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,606
There's nothing I hate more than
people at the stage door.

121
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,475
They feel like they have to
tell you how good you are.

122
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,015
It's fake and awkward
and I just don't do it.

123
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,880
Oh look, Patti LuPone.

124
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:43,816
Do you always beat
the audience?

125
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,547
So far so good.

126
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,020
What about your fans?

127
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:48,625
My "fans"?
Yeah right.

128
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,819
Oh, I'm working at
'Mostly Sondheim' later,

129
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,928
so if you wanna stop by, let me know.

130
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:54,827
I cant wait to hear some fat
guy singing "All that Jazz."

131
00:08:55,034 --> 00:09:00,904
Or some flamer singing "And
I am telling you, Sophie."

132
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:04,508
Show tunes and booze kids.
That's what keeps me happy.

133
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:05,609
I'll see you guys later.

134
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:06,971
Yeah later.

135
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,176
Oh, I'm sorry!

136
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,052
No problem.
See you tomorrow.

137
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:18,621
Hey babe.
Great first preview.

138
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:21,691
See you soon.
Smiley face.

139
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,392
We are so proud ofyou.

140
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:26,793
You're gonna be such a
big starin New York City.

141
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,125
It's just Off-Broadway.

142
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,666
Just Off-Broadway?

143
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,435
People would sell their souls

144
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,096
to be starring in an Off-Broadway
show, and don't you forget it.

145
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:37,276
We just wanted to call and tell
you how proud we are of you.

146
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,140
And congratulations.

147
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,539
Thank you.

148
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,111
We have a surprise foryou.

149
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,049
We're coming to your
opening night.

150
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,651
Hey, we weren't going to
miss your big night, huh?

151
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:49,843
Hey, we've been to all the others.

152
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,149
How could we miss your first
New York City opening night?

153
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,757
The first of many.

154
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,892
Oh, great!

155
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,722
Hey, we should let you go
and enjoy your success.

156
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,761
Oh yeah, God bless.

157
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,058
We love you honey.

158
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,598
God bless.

159
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,633
I love you too.

160
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,543
Hi everyone.
Welcome to 'Mostly Sondheim!'

161
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,148
We have one hell of a crowd here.

162
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,945
'Mostly Sondheim' is like
an open mic night for show tunes.

163
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,882
Every song you sing has
to be from a show

164
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,989
or from a songwriter that
has written a show.

165
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,715
Oh, actually you can
sing whatever you want

166
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,826
if you tip twenty dollars.
We don 't care.

167
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,996
And I couldn't imagine beginning
Mostly Sondheim

168
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,290
without hearing my gorgeous co-host,

169
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:38,033
Kate Pazakis' gregarious,
fabulous vocal chords.

170
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:38,999
Gregarious?

171
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,502
I don't know. I just
made up the word.

172
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,697
So, hit it Jack! And
don't forget to tip.

173
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,678
? Fridaynight. ?

174
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,009
? I spend the whole week
waiting for Friday night. ?

175
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:56,855
? Anticipating all the
lonely hearts. ?

176
00:10:57,056 --> 00:11:02,392
? We all play parts on Friday night. ?

177
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:12,664
? 'Cause that's when
the party starts! ?

178
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:15,932
? And the party isn 't
over 'til the bar runs dry, ?

179
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:19,305
? and the next one too,
where you catch my eye. ?

180
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:26,083
? No the party isn 't over 'til we
hail a cab and I go home with you. ?

181
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,812
? See, the party isn't
over 'til I've seen your face. ?

182
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,014
? And I know it's you,
from outer space! ?

183
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:36,661
? And the party isn 't
over 'til I find the one. ?

184
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:43,768
? 'Til I fall in love with you! ?

185
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,001
Alright!

186
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:55,174
Well, it's four AM, and you know
what that means, folks!

187
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,975
You 're gonna finally play
some fucking Sondheim?

188
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:01,779
No, it means you have to go home
and don't forget to tip!

189
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,579
'Mostly Sondheim' my ass!

190
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,917
They should call it
'Mostly Jason Robert Brown.'

191
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,615
Goodnight everybody.
Get home safe!

192
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,021
Goodnight!

193
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,096
You're ready to go?

194
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:16,096
I'm ready for a lot of things.

195
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,862
Hmm, I like the way that sounds.

196
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,276
Look!

197
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,375
The homosexuals lifestyle is the
biggest threat our nation has,

198
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:34,014
even more so than terrorism.

199
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,221
And they call themselves Christians.

200
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,451
Didn't Jesus say

201
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,952
"Do to your neighbors as you
would have them do unto you"?

202
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:45,221
Well, that sounds
like a good philosophy.

203
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:48,724
Wait!

204
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:49,491
What?

205
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,269
No flood?
No Iightning?

206
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,462
No wrath of God?

207
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,075
I guess He approves.

208
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,175
C'mon.

209
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,383
We've gotta be
good neighbors.

210
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:09,542
[Text signal]

211
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,814
Another text from
the boyfriend?

212
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,919
Sebastian is not my boyfriend.

213
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,916
We've only been dating
a couple weeks.

214
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,021
Honey, you've been
single forever.

215
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,714
If I were you I'd call
him a boyfriend

216
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,258
just so I could say I had
one this millennium.

217
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,428
It's not about having a boyfriend.

218
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,224
It's about finding the right one.

219
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,194
I have a little surprise for you.

220
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,924
Because you've both
been so wonderful,

221
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,103
I'm giving you some
special wedding gifts.

222
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,204
What?!
He's giving them more stuff!

223
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,567
I bet they'll start
singing show tunes.

224
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:41,208
Art, fashion, creativity, music!

225
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,981
? Look at them who are so happy. ?

226
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,083
? Look at them, so content. ?

227
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:51,188
? Living there in our garden
while we're here in a tent! ?

228
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,551
? This fight isn't over. ?

229
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,927
? No, they are gonna pay! ?

230
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:58,392
? Those man who are so happy, ?

231
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:01,589
? those men who are so gay! ?

232
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:03,427
Maybe that's what
we should call 'em.

233
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,365
Gays!

234
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,833
'Cause they're happy.

235
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,234
Shut up!

236
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,899
Hey, this isn't my fault!

237
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,004
God and his damn fruit.

238
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:17,546
Oh, hey Steve.

239
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,418
Hey Adam.
Look what I just made.

240
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,283
OK, now it's official.
You are a genius!

241
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:26,981
Oh you're too sweet.

242
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:28,250
Who would've ever thought

243
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,360
you could get this awesome
juice out of a potato?

244
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:31,791
Well look at these cool
glasses you made.

245
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:32,988
They're hand blown!

246
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,929
That has always been one
of your specialties.

247
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:35,931
What about last night?

248
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,433
You figured out how
to pull the skin back.

249
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,831
It's so much better that way.

250
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,098
I know, now I really like bananas.

251
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,206
Hey, I wonder if our kids
are going to be like us...

252
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,571
or like them.

253
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,003
What do you mean?

254
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:51,205
How do we now if our kids are
going to be cultured and stuff?.

255
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,146
Or like us?

256
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:58,686
Well, we'll just have to teach our
kids to be like us, that's all.

257
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,651
And tell them to stay away
from the garden.

258
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,526
Hey!
Who are you?

259
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:12,830
Hi, I'm Adam
and this is my husband Steve.

260
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,164
What's your name?

261
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,431
Cain.

262
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,101
Do you want a banana?

263
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,370
Mommy,
can I eatAdam's banana?

264
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,774
Make sure you
pull the skin back.

265
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,143
Stay away from them!

266
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,376
They're trying
to convert our children.

267
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,384
That's how they plan to do it.

268
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:32,079
They don't have to go through
labor pains at all.

269
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,950
They just use fruit!

270
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,253
Cain!

271
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:40,255
God doesn't like the gay people.

272
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,299
That's why he keeps them locked
up in the gated garden.

273
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:48,132
And He's given us...
this entire desert,

274
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:51,605
which is why He loves us more.

275
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:56,274
? Be careful of gaypeople, ?

276
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,006
? and theirperverted needs. ?

277
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,481
? Theywantyou to be like them, ?

278
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,381
? but God needs you to breed. ?

279
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,647
? Those gays want to convert you ?

280
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,748
? and your little brother too. ?

281
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,423
? Make your parents proud of you. ?

282
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,596
? You know what just to do. ?

283
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,027
Go check on your little brother.

284
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,334
? This fight isn 't over. ?

285
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,366
? No, they are gonna pay. ?

286
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,663
? Those men who are so happy,?

287
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,564
? those men who are so gay. ?

288
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,176
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!

289
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,379
What is it Cain?

290
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:30,381
I had to...
I had to kill Abel.

291
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:31,913
What?
Why?

292
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:33,914
He was...
He was...

293
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,517
He was singing a showtune.

294
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,725
NO!

295
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,117
Not a showtune!

296
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,694
? Somehow they got to Abel, ?

297
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,067
? andtaught him their sick ways. ?

298
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,428
? Wontyou please protect me Mommy ?

299
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,537
? from turning out that way? ?

300
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:57,706
Don't worry Cain.
I'll protect you from those people!

301
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,375
I promise you Mommy,
I will never ever

302
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,377
sing a showtune.

303
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,345
? We'll show His chosen people ?

304
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,679
?just who will win this fight. ?

305
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,079
? Abel's death
is on their heads now. ?

306
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,087
? I know that we are right. ?

307
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,385
? We must stop them
from recruiting ?

308
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,686
? new people to their fray. ?

309
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,724
? And hate has many uses. ?

310
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,362
? We hate those who are gay! ?

311
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,464
Cain, get th at book
Mama's been working on.

312
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:29,767
You mean the Breeder's lnformational
Book of Living Examples?

313
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,198
Yes, honey.

314
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,401
But we call it
"the B.I.B.L.E." for short.

315
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,746
What are you writing it for?

316
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:40,607
I have to teach our descendants
to hate the gays.

317
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,344
Do you think this book will be enough
to warn them in the future?

318
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:44,522
What if they don't believe it?

319
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,215
They'll believe what they read.

320
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,222
In five thousand year from now,

321
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:52,363
they wont even know who
wrote the damn thing!

322
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,733
? We'll get His chosen people. ?

323
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,400
? Those men, we'll make them pay. ?

324
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,300
? I will teach all of the children ?

325
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,533
? to hate those who are gay. ?

326
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:10,443
? All of those showtune singing ?

327
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:15,484
? gays! ?

328
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:01,232
Hey.

329
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,491
Hi.

330
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,437
You 're cute.

331
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,431
Thanks.

332
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,810
I'm just here to relax.

333
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,982
I can help with that.

334
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,078
I'm actually seeing someone.

335
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,476
I'm not gonna tell him.

336
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,546
I'm not here to hook up.

337
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,419
C'mon, just let me suck you off.

338
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:28,353
No!

339
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,551
Just leave me the fuck alone.

340
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:34,063
I tried to be nice but... Christ!

341
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,863
Dick.

342
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:40,131
Can I talk to you about something?

343
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,203
Sure, what is it?

344
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,771
My parents are coming
to opening night.

345
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,306
That's great!

346
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,471
It is. I mean they've always
been so supportive,

347
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,942
but I never expected them to
come all the way for this.

348
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:52,374
It is your first New York opening.
You shouldn't be surprised.

349
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,347
I know, but my parents
are very religious.

350
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:57,344
Oh, so do your parents know
what the show is about?

351
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:00,457
I told them it was "Adam and
Eve - The Way God Made 'Em".

352
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,752
Yeah, there gonna be surprised.

353
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,758
And they don't know about me either.

354
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,364
This is gonna be good.

355
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,197
I'm sorry.

356
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,234
I'm serious.
I'm freaking out.

357
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,199
They wouldn't let us
read Harry Potter,

358
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:14,839
because it was all magic
and against God.

359
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,667
Well if they think Harry
Potter is sacrilegious,

360
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,740
I cant wait to hear their
review of this show.

361
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,571
I try to be good,
I don't have sex...

362
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,770
But you've had sex right?

363
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,775
What?
Seriously?

364
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,816
I wanted to wait for the right guy.

365
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:32,252
But I don't really go out and meet
people so I never really found one.

366
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:35,722
Wow. But haven't you
ever been curious?

367
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,588
No.

368
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,728
Yes.
I don't know.

369
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,696
Look, sex is the last thing on my mind
right now. What am I gonna do?

370
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,094
I wish I knew what to tell you.

371
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:45,701
My parents are gonna hate me.

372
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:48,429
No they're not. It's all gonna
be OK. Trust me.

373
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,835
Look, we gotta go.
We'll talk later?.

374
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:51,975
Yeah.

375
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:52,976
Ok.

376
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:55,209
God I wish this wasn't happening.

377
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:58,781
And just as the prophecies foretold,
five thousand years later,

378
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:02,284
God putAdam and Steve back on the
Earth to prove their love was real,

379
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:05,413
and able to beat the obstacles
of the modern world.

380
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,386
They were put in different places,

381
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:11,824
and in homes that used the Breeders
lnformational Book of Living Examples.

382
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:17,426
? I was sitting backstage ?

383
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:20,603
? and wondering what to say ?

384
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:24,572
? so I raised my hands to Heaven ?

385
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:28,576
? and I began to pray. ?

386
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,872
? And Jesus said to ?

387
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:30,878
? praise Him. ?

388
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:31,845
? Jesus said to ?

389
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:32,709
? love Him. ?

390
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:33,850
? Jesus said to ?

391
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:35,417
? glorify Him. ?

392
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,348
? Yes, Jesus said. ?

393
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:37,419
? Oh, Jesus said ?

394
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:38,452
? find salvation. ?

395
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,591
? He said make a...
donation. ?

396
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:43,955
? Jesus said, oh Jesus said.
Oh, yes he said! ?

397
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,958
And Jesus said to me,
"Patty Maye,

398
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:54,636
Patty Maye, I want you to go out
and tell the people how you feel.

399
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,468
Tell them how you feel
about being a Christian."

400
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,944
So Jesus, this one's for you.

401
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,810
? I'm proud to be a Christian ?

402
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,985
? and to love my fellow man. ?

403
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,821
? Proud to be a Christian ?

404
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:13,923
? to help others when I can. ?

405
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,889
? I'm proud to be a Christian ?

406
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:19,427
? and be nice to everyone. ?

407
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:22,998
? We're not better than
the Jews or the Arabs ?

408
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,495
? as they continue to fight. ?

409
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:28,935
? We're not better than the
Catholics, those boozers, ?

410
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:33,942
? but we are always right. ?

411
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,706
And do you know why
I know we're right?

412
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:37,609
? And Jesus said to ?

413
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:38,580
? praise Him. ?

414
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,582
? Jesus said to ?

415
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:40,583
? love Him. ?

416
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:41,584
? Jesus said to ?

417
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:42,947
? glorify Him. ?

418
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:43,780
? Yes, Jesus said. ?

419
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:44,717
? Oh, yes He said ?

420
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:45,912
? find salvation. ?

421
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:48,058
? He said make a...
donation. ?

422
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,657
? Jesus said, oh Jesus said,
oh yes He said! ?

423
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:56,392
Isn't she wonderful?

424
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:01,095
Everyday I thank the Lord for
bringing me Patty Maye.

425
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,508
Now, do you know
what it is time for?

426
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:04,732
Well, I hope so.

427
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,741
It is time to hear about Jesus!

428
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:08,640
Amen!

429
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:12,544
But before I can tell y'all about
the word of the Lord,

430
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:15,845
I need to talk to you about
something very important.

431
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:19,147
My friends,
partners in my ministry,

432
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:23,050
we have fallen on hard times.

433
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:28,559
Now, we want to express across
the world our message,

434
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,201
but, we are running out of money!

435
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:33,730
Now you know all the
money in your wallets

436
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,873
and in your bank accounts
and on your credit cards,

437
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:38,634
well, that is not your money!

438
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:41,004
That is God's money,

439
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,511
and God needs his money back!

440
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:44,773
Hallelujah!

441
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,974
And then last thing, just
at the end of "creation"

442
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,618
I want a sforzando
on the "aah",

443
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,947
so just watch me, it will
be like "aaaaahh!"

444
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,757
Like that, yeah?

445
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:53,754
Yes.

446
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,153
Thank you so much.

447
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,520
Have a good second act.

448
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:57,559
Thank you.

449
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,293
So, what do you think I should do?

450
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,898
About what?
Your parents or your virginity?

451
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,931
What? Huh? What?

452
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:06,728
You're a vir...

453
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:10,436
You'll have to excuse her. She's
never had to use that word before.

454
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:14,669
That is not true. I used to pray to
that Mary person and she was a vir...

455
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,211
Are you really a virgin?

456
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,606
This probably wasn't the best
place for this conversation.

457
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,477
We can help you out
with your virginity.

458
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:22,051
Oh, no you can't.
Leave him alone.

459
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:25,052
I didn't mean it like that. I meant
come out with us tonight.

460
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,384
We know a lot of hot boys.
We can get you laid.

461
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:28,354
Come out with us!

462
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,652
I'm not trying to get laid.

463
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,853
Going out tonight might be good
for you. Take your mind off things.

464
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:34,622
Give you a chance to clear your head.

465
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,734
And Sebastian and I will be there
to make sure these whores

466
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:39,927
don't put you on an express
train to hell.

467
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,799
Are you calling me a whore?

468
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:46,477
If I wasn't sitting in this chair
right now, I'd take my...

469
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:48,168
But you are, Blanche!
You are!

470
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,863
To alcohol!

471
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:16,234
Go-go dancing. I couldn't
imagine doing that.

472
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,536
Is he for real?
Red panties.

473
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,474
I know, and he has a zit
on his right butt cheek.

474
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:32,921
Alright, let's get him another.

475
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:34,819
I'll be right back.

476
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:35,890
Okay.

477
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:40,662
Hey! Hey you!
How you doing?

478
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,992
I've never been better.
This was such a good idea.

479
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:45,533
Are you sure?
You seem pretty wasted.

480
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:48,867
You can call it "wasted',
I call it "free!"

481
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,235
Okay, just don't do
anything stupid.

482
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,982
I'll show you guys dancing.

483
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:10,083
What is this?

484
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,263
No, no, no, no.

485
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:18,101
Alright, I am so over you
and your friends.

486
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:24,102
Put it on my face,
put it on my face, yeah

487
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:37,785
Oh my God.

488
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:00,867
So good!
Don't knock yourself out.

489
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,681
I think this is yours.

490
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,251
I have no idea how it
ended up off of me.

491
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:11,649
May I help you
put it back on?

492
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,721
You can help me do anything.

493
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:15,256
Oh really?

494
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,794
Yeah.

495
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,030
Not in front of my friends.

496
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:27,135
What?

497
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:29,135
We can't kiss in front of my friends.

498
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,001
You know you kissed me right?

499
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:32,732
Yeah, I know, but

500
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:35,310
we can't do this in
front of my friends.

501
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:45,018
Do you want to go somewhere?

502
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,247
I've always wanted
to go to Paris.

503
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,286
Well, for tonight,
lets go to my place.

504
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,293
That will do for now.

505
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:01,932
Hey hold this,
I'll be right back.

506
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:11,242
Hey Eddie!

507
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:13,272
Can I talk to you a minute?

508
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:14,315
Sure, what's up?

509
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:15,486
Sorry.

510
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,217
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

511
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:19,423
Yeah, why?

512
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,291
I just want to make sure.

513
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,358
You and your newfound freedom.

514
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,423
You don't have to go home with anyone.

515
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,229
Yeah, I know.

516
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,829
I wanna go home with him.

517
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:31,365
He's really hot.

518
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,498
Okay.

519
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:36,130
I appreciate it.
Goodnight.

520
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:37,000
Be safe.

521
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,470
Uh huh.

522
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:03,792
I've never done this before.

523
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:06,026
Just relax.

524
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,238
Doesn't this feel good?

525
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:10,898
Yes.

526
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,752
Wait, shouldn 't we get a con...

527
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,951
Don't worry about it.

528
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,521
Do you do this a lot?

529
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:32,525
No, you're special.

530
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:39,027
So, what happened
to you last night?

531
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:40,204
What do you mean?

532
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,373
Well, first you were drunk, and
then you were with that guy...

533
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:43,404
Scott?

534
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:44,233
Scott.

535
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:45,272
Did you do it?

536
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,841
Did you tap his little ass?

537
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:50,310
Well, he actually...

538
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,411
No!

539
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:54,347
What?

540
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,080
You bottomed for a bottom?

541
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:58,016
I don't even know what to say to that.

542
00:30:58,456 --> 00:30:59,480
But you were safe, right?

543
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:00,182
What?

544
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,156
You were safe, right?

545
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:02,193
Safe?

546
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:04,918
When you had sex,
you used a condom?

547
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,456
He doesn't have sex a lot.

548
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:08,497
He said it would hurt more if...

549
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,491
Are you serious?

550
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:13,997
He's a slut! Don't you ever have
unsafe sex again, you hear me?

551
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,038
Never!
I don't care who you're with.

552
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,038
You just met him, that's crazy!

553
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:19,903
But...

554
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:22,170
Never have unsafe sex!

555
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:23,380
Ok?

556
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:25,549
Yes.
Fine.

557
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:28,043
Five minutes guys!

558
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:29,948
Thanks, five.

559
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:32,918
So, what should I do
about my parents?

560
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:35,786
Well, whatever you do, don't tell them
a bottom banged you bareback.

561
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,188
I'm serious!

562
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:41,091
Look, whatever you do, whatever
you tell them, just...

563
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:43,596
make sure you do it
before they get here.

564
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:45,401
[text signal]

565
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:46,865
What the hell?

566
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,265
What's wrong?

567
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:55,136
Someone told Sebastian
that I was HlV positive.

568
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,480
Oh, that makes sense now,
all the safe stuff.

569
00:31:58,683 --> 00:31:59,445
I'm so sorry, I didn't...

570
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:00,514
I'm not!

571
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:03,443
I'm not positive!

572
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:07,985
Benny, you know what
I think it's time for?

573
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:11,495
I think it's time to tell all
our Christian friends

574
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,626
just what's going on in our
own family right now.

575
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,967
Are you sure you're up
for it, Sugar Plum?

576
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:18,157
I'm strong.

577
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:19,270
Strong.

578
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:20,235
For Jesus!

579
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,530
That's my Patty!

580
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,236
I'm not sure if y'all
know this or not,

581
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:32,276
but one of our very own singing
angels is my nephew, Steven.

582
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:36,509
My sister became a Catholic
for her husband,

583
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,453
and they have been raising Steven

584
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:41,054
as a Catholic!

585
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,384
Oh Lord.

586
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:49,965
Jesus just told me how
much that hurt Him!

587
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:55,102
Now, a couple of weeks ago,
Steven came to me and he said,

588
00:32:55,306 --> 00:33:00,005
"Aunt Patty, I think there's something
you need to know."

589
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:02,370
Well, I clutched my heart and I said

590
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,414
"Please, dear Jesus. Let him tell me
he's leaving the Catholic Church!"

591
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:07,641
Praise Jesus!

592
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:13,046
But no, he said, "Aunt Patty,

593
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:16,950
I am a hhh...homosexual."

594
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:18,162
Homosexual!

595
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:23,598
Well, I fell to my knees and I said,
"No Jesus! No! He's become a priest!"

596
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:24,593
Oh no!

597
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:27,596
Well, thank Jesus,
he was not a priest.

598
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,032
But he was a hh...homosexual.

599
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,179
But at least that's a disease
we can cure him of.

600
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:39,015
Well, Benny and I talked to him,

601
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:44,587
and we read him parts of the bible
where it says homosexuality is wrong.

602
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,318
God hates them.

603
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:47,983
Hates them! Yes!

604
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:51,457
And then, Jesus gave me my mission.

605
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:56,463
And Benny and I together
started a retreat program

606
00:33:56,667 --> 00:34:01,400
to help those young homosexuals
on the straight path to Jesus!

607
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:02,402
Good Lord!

608
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:05,701
To scare that demon of
homosexuality out of them!

609
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,099
Praise Jesus!

610
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:10,644
And we found a wonderful
recovered homosexual

611
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,781
named Bruce Cohan,

612
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,175
not Cohen.

613
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:19,353
And he used to be a choreographer
on the Broadway

614
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,047
until he found Jesus.

615
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:21,782
Yes indeed!

616
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,354
And he will lead that retreat!

617
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,324
Yes Lord!

618
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,987
Now part of your donations today

619
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:32,762
will go towards the "Foundation
Against Gayness Society."

620
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:39,242
Now, here's our nephew,
the reformed Catholic,

621
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:41,344
and soon to be reformed homosexual,

622
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:42,376
Praise Lord!

623
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:46,107
Steven, to give his testimony.

624
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:50,047
Praise Jesus.

625
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:51,346
Praise Jesus.

626
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:00,292
This whole situation has been
very difficult for me.

627
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:02,429
You see,

628
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:04,430
I love the Lord,

629
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:06,693
but, I know He doesn't love me.

630
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,706
I know He doesn't want
me to be gay.

631
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:14,172
And I know He won't love me
until I stop being this way.

632
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,647
? I will change foryou. ?

633
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:23,082
? I will change foryou, my God! ?

634
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:29,317
? I will be the boy
you want me to be! ?

635
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:33,088
? I will change for you. ?

636
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:37,292
? I will change foryou, my God. ?

637
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:43,566
? I just want to know
you love me again. ?

638
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:46,604
? I'll cast off these
wicked passions, ?

639
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,439
? these desires that I feel. ?

640
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:54,175
? I'll cast out these thoughts
that so offend Thy will. ?

641
00:35:54,385 --> 00:36:01,223
? I will change, I promise,
I will change. ?

642
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:14,566
? I will change foryou my God. ?

643
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:17,367
Hey Sebastian, it's Paul.

644
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,702
Please call me back,
we need to talk about this.

645
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:24,075
I'm not positive. I don't know
who told you that, but it's a lie.

646
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,339
Please call me back.
Bye.

647
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:31,348
This is the Lyons. Leave a message
and we'll call you right back.

648
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,749
Hi Mom and Dad, it's just me.

649
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:39,259
I just got out the show and
I wanted to call to say hi.

650
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,589
Hope you guys are well.

651
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,600
We'll talk soon.

652
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:47,198
I love you.

653
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:48,899
A lot.

654
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,466
? Well, you know I've been a liar... ?

655
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,769
I can 't believe someone
would do that to you.

656
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:57,573
I mean, if someone told him I was a
drunk or something I wouldn't care.

657
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,409
'Cause it's true.

658
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,613
This is just vicious.

659
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:03,343
Fuck it.

660
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,953
I'll be right back.

661
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,325
That's Johnny, everyone!

662
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,688
All right, now it's time for
us to bring up one of our

663
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,420
regulars here at 'Mostly Sondheim.'

664
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:14,596
Come on up, Dante!

665
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,393
He's not gonna sing
that song again?

666
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:18,261
Hey.

667
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:19,527
You better sing 'Meadowlark' later.

668
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:20,328
Ok.

669
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:22,866
This is one of my favorite songs.

670
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:24,831
Oh yes he is.

671
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:30,503
? Fernando, the espresso man, ?

672
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:33,479
? brings mejava when he can. ?

673
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:36,520
? Fernando, the espresso man, ?

674
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,420
? I love him a lot a lot a ?

675
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:39,715
? latte! ?

676
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,484
Someone please shoot me!

677
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:43,825
Here.

678
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,325
Just shoot these.

679
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,894
? Fills my coffee with his cream! ?

680
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:49,666
You're ok?

681
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:51,435
Yeah...

682
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:52,832
? I love him a lot a lot a ?

683
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:54,299
? latte! ?

684
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,333
Thanks for coming here.

685
00:37:58,542 --> 00:37:59,839
I just wish I was in better spirits.

686
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:01,409
It's ok.

687
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:04,540
Is it strange that he's
not calling me back?

688
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:06,876
Who?
Oh, thanks.

689
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,413
Scott.

690
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,713
He isn't calling me back.

691
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:13,321
What'd you think was gonna happen?

692
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:16,425
You met him. You had sex.
That's pretty much the end of it.

693
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:19,488
But I thought he liked me.

694
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:23,224
Eddie, it's not about liking you or
not liking you. It was just sex!

695
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:24,366
But it was so special.

696
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:26,832
It was just sex, trust me.

697
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,903
Just sex?

698
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:32,701
So I should just go out and
have sex with people?

699
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,642
What the hell do I know?

700
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:39,974
Why does being gay have
to be this hard?

701
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,353
I don't know, but you can't
let this get you down.

702
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:47,820
You can't let this asshole hurt you.
You just have to pick up and move on.

703
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,419
Everything is gonna be OK.

704
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,255
And if you're looking
for more then sex,

705
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,830
you don't sleep with the guy
an hour after you met him.

706
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,067
I just feel awful.

707
00:38:58,035 --> 00:39:00,003
And my butt still hurts.

708
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:02,539
I'm sorry.

709
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:06,337
As Homer Simpson so admirably put it,

710
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:11,880
"To alcohol, the cause of
and solution to all of life's problems."

711
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:16,715
So, what are you gonna
do about Sebastian?

712
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:49,777
Paul?

713
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,650
Yeah.

714
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:00,552
Hey!

715
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:02,630
Thanks for calling me back.

716
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,357
No, I'm fine.

717
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,559
I just have a lot on my
mind right now.

718
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,496
A lot!

719
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:11,607
Look, I can't really talk right now.
I'm on my way to a dance class,

720
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:13,037
but I'll call you later.

721
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:14,877
Bye, love you.

722
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:19,710
Hey Sebastian, it's Paul.

723
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:20,917
Again.

724
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:24,144
Listen, I just got tested for you
and I'm negative.

725
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:25,988
We need to talk.

726
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,395
What are you writing, your memoirs?

727
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,560
No, I'm just trying to get
my thoughts together.

728
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:35,697
You're OK?

729
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:40,166
Yeah, this whole Sebastian thing
is just freaking me out.

730
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,471
Oh, I got tested.

731
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:43,162
And?

732
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:44,404
I'm negative.

733
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:45,472
Of course.

734
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:49,407
But no matter how safe you are,
those tests are just so nerve-wracking.

735
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,808
What did Sebastian say when you
told him you were tested?

736
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,981
Nothing. He hasn't even
called me back yet.

737
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,476
He's an asshole.

738
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:56,675
No, he's just confused.

739
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:59,685
No, he's an asshole.
You at least deserve a phone call.

740
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:03,189
You know, I try and look for a healthy
monogamous relationship,

741
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:05,391
or someone to spend my life with,

742
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:08,396
but I always end up getting fucked.

743
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:09,533
And not in a good way.

744
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:13,635
That's why I don't do the love thing
anymore. It get's too complicated.

745
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:16,568
What you need is to get fucked...
and in a good way!

746
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:21,871
I want a husband, two point five kids,
a house in the Hamptons and a dog.

747
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:24,480
I don't wanna be a slut
like everyone else.

748
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:25,910
Are you talking about me?

749
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:28,550
Oh, I don't think the word
slut does you justice.

750
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:29,776
Bitch!

751
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:30,885
Whore!

752
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:31,884
Slut!

753
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:33,078
Oh, you wish!

754
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,425
Look, if you wanna change,
then change.

755
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:38,027
If you don't, then stop
bitching about it!

756
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:42,598
It's just sex, it doesn't
have to be special.

757
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,869
It's just like working out.
But with someone else.

758
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:48,698
But I want sex to be special -
to mean something.

759
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,496
But why?

760
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:55,570
Imagine if you went to a theme park
and walked around and around

761
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:58,009
until you found the perfect
rollercoaster.

762
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:00,876
By the time you picked the right one,
the park would be closed,

763
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:03,610
and you wouldn't have gotten
to enjoy anything.

764
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:06,949
Sometimes you should just
shut up and enjoy the ride.

765
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:09,025
Cute analogy.

766
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:10,124
I am impressed.

767
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,688
Thanks.

768
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,955
Go on.
Be a slut.

769
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:17,759
Be a great big slut.
Try 'Manhunt.'

770
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:20,036
I'm not going on 'Manhunt.'

771
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,037
Position?

772
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,610
Top.

773
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,243
Versatile.

774
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,051
Hello!

775
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:34,107
Hello!

776
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:36,381
Tonight I've dug into my trunk

777
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:39,112
and pulled out a song that I've
never ever sung before.

778
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:44,955
It seems to be the new theme song
since I've had my 'epiphany.'

779
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:52,060
? I was raised to have values. ?

780
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:57,030
? Of myforbearance,
myparents would be proud! ?

781
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:59,575
This is fantastic!

782
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:04,976
? So forgive, this vulgar phrase
which now I shall use. ?

783
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:10,050
? God, I need to get plowed! ?

784
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:12,213
? To hell with romance. ?

785
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:14,847
? Just drop your pants. ?

786
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:19,626
? I wanna be a slut. ?

787
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,060
I decided to hook up online.

788
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,757
It's happening. The end
of the world is upon us.

789
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:26,800
Run for your lives!
Hell has frozen over.

790
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:29,302
? But now I don't care. ?

791
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:33,837
? As long as myfeet
end up in the air. ?

792
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:38,139
? Well, I wanna be a slut. ?

793
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:40,943
I've tried the whole dating
thing. It didn't work,

794
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:42,311
so I'm trying something new.

795
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,618
Show us your profile!

796
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:44,685
No!

797
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:47,288
Bitch, let us help you.
We're professional sluts.

798
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:48,715
Trust us.

799
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:50,359
? I'm eagerto please. ?

800
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,694
? I'm down on my knees. ?

801
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:54,223
You're using your headshot?

802
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:58,693
Child, I have a camera. But do not use
your headshot. That's just crazy!

803
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:02,661
? You'll be the grill,
maybe I'll be the meat. ?

804
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:07,139
? I'll be the harbor
and you'll be the fleet. ?

805
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:11,609
Perfect!

806
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:12,747
But you cut off my head.

807
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,180
Exactly! Now we're gonna
take one with your face.

808
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:18,821
And you don't have to show this pic

809
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:20,285
unless you're interested in
the guy you're talking to.

810
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:23,693
I never realized being
a slut was so hard.

811
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:25,555
? Like a teenage gorilla. ?

812
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:27,396
Don't worry baby, we'll help you.

813
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:31,197
? You don't have to be
all that buff or a jock boy. ?

814
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:36,237
? Let's cut to the chase,
let's see your cock boy. ?

815
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,930
? All guilt has ceased. ?

816
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:40,708
? Pretend I'm a priest. ?

817
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:45,142
? I wanna be a slut! ?

818
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,909
? In the john in the mall, ?

819
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:50,177
? giving head in a stall. ?

820
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:54,687
? I wanna be a slut. ?

821
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,050
? Call me Maxwell, I'm good. ?

822
00:44:57,327 --> 00:44:59,386
? To the very last drop. ?

823
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:01,697
? Call me bitch, call me whore, ?

824
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,433
? go ahead, call a cop. ?

825
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:09,033
? Whoeveryou call, just
be sure he's a top. ?

826
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:13,801
? I've tattooed a target on my butt. ?

827
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:17,170
? Cause I wanna be a... ?

828
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,781
It's like Will Rodgers
always used to say,

829
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:21,917
"l never met a man I didn 't like."

830
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:29,753
? Cause I wanna be a slut! ?

831
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:31,821
My parents would have loved this.

832
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:35,822
Paul Connor everybody.

833
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:40,036
Lord! Take a break. Crazy!

834
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:42,166
Alright, let's do something else.

835
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:43,031
Sorry.

836
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:44,201
Hi.

837
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,170
Hey.

838
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:47,070
I really liked watching you.

839
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:49,372
Do you wanna see more?

840
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,338
Mm-hm.

841
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:53,743
You're place?

842
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:55,885
Sure.

843
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:59,752
? I met my love in a very odd way. ?

844
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:05,122
? From a distance, we connected. ?

845
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:07,388
That was awesome.

846
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:10,129
I do what I can.

847
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:13,229
Did you cum?

848
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:16,167
No.

849
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:17,940
Oh no, no.

850
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:19,507
I wanna make you cum.

851
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:22,174
I'm just really drunk.

852
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,285
Come on.

853
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,928
What?

854
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:51,131
Yeah... uh...
I don't cuddle.

855
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:56,371
Goodnight.

856
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:18,024
? Looking at men makes us sick! ?

857
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:19,566
? Looking at men makes us sick! ?

858
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:21,494
? We don't wanna suck on dick! ?

859
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:23,065
? We don't wanna suck on dick! ?

860
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:24,205
? Sound off! ?

861
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:24,999
? One, two. ?

862
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:25,868
? Sound off! ?

863
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:26,542
? Three, four. ?

864
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:27,410
? Bring it on home. ?

865
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:29,242
? One, two, three, four. ?

866
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:31,346
? One, two. Three, four. ?

867
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:36,849
Ok boys, it's time to start
talking about Jesus!

868
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,177
Sorry, I'm late.

869
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:40,321
Oh, that's OK Sweetie...

870
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,252
Son!

871
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,289
We're just getting started here.

872
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:45,358
Steve, why don't you
get him a T-shirt?

873
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:52,461
Thanks.

874
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:56,529
Thanks.

875
00:47:57,307 --> 00:48:00,208
First thing I wanna do is
learn our camp song.

876
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:03,142
And if you ever forget
what it's called,

877
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:07,078
all you have to do is look down
on your camp T-shirt.

878
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:09,184
Now, this is how it goes.

879
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:14,253
? I'm gonna go straight...
to Heaven. ?

880
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:18,485
? I'm gonna go be Jesus' friend. ?

881
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:23,026
? I'm gonna go straight...
to Heaven. ?

882
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:27,936
? I'm never gonna be gay,
be gay again. ?

883
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:31,164
OK, now it's time for
all of you to try.

884
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:35,208
? I'm gonna go straight...
to Heaven. ?

885
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:40,049
? I'm gonna go be Jesus' friend. ?

886
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:44,152
? I'm gonna go straight...
to Heaven. ?

887
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:48,921
? I'm never gonna be gay,
be gay again. ?

888
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:52,562
? Here at 'FAGS'camp,
we've come to learn ?

889
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:55,557
? how to change our ways. ?

890
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:59,627
? We're gonna stop being sissy men. ?

891
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:03,471
? So when we pray
to Jesus, we can say ?

892
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:05,335
? I'm gonna go straight.
Straight! ?

893
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:07,270
? To Heaven.
Yeah! ?

894
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,810
? I'm gonna go be Jesus' friend. ?

895
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:10,775
? Hey Jesus! ?

896
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:14,472
? I'm gonna go straight...
to Heaven. ?

897
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:18,314
? I'm never gonna be gay,
be gay again. ?

898
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:22,187
? Here at 'FAGS'camp,
we're on our knees. ?

899
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:25,418
? But it's just to pray! ?

900
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:28,689
? We're gonna learn to
be rugged and butch. ?

901
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:32,134
? So when we pray
to Jesus, we can say ?

902
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:35,600
? I'm gonna go straight...
to Heaven. ?

903
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:39,032
? I'm gonna go be Jesus' friend. ?

904
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:42,302
? I'm gonna go straight...
to Heaven. ?

905
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,971
? We're never gonna be gay. ?

906
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:31,388
? I'm gonna go straight...
to Heaven. ?

907
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:35,190
? I'm gonna go be Jesus' friend. ?

908
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:39,495
? I'm gonna go straight...
to Heaven. ?

909
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,001
? I'm never gonna be gay. ?

910
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:44,467
? Be gay again. ?

911
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:51,480
Excuse me! I saw the show.
I just wanted to say hi.

912
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:52,912
You saw the show?

913
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:53,674
Yeah.

914
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:56,450
There's no way you could have seen it
and made it back here this fast.

915
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:59,417
Oh, well, I saw the show last night,

916
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:02,217
but by the time I made it to the
stage door you'd already left,

917
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:04,758
so I came to meet you tonight.

918
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:06,891
Glad you liked the show.

919
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:08,597
You look familiar.

920
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:11,734
Oh, I go to 'Mostly Sondheim'
once in a while.

921
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:12,726
Oh, cool!

922
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:15,798
Well, make sure you say hi next
time you're at Sondheim.

923
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:21,644
Do you... think maybe we could grab a
drink or go for coffee or something?

924
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:22,669
I don't know.

925
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,277
I have to run but, but I'm sure I'll
run into you again soon, OK?

926
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,436
Hey!

927
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,807
So, how was your workout?

928
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:04,380
Fine, yours?

929
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,088
It was good.

930
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:17,157
So I was thinking,

931
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:18,527
maybe we could...

932
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:20,767
You know what would be really hot?

933
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:22,195
What?

934
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:25,603
Not you.

935
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:32,541
Doyou want to take a walk?

936
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:33,841
OK.

937
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:35,649
But don't try anything.

938
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:38,821
I won't touch you I promise.

939
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:43,286
It's so beautiful here.

940
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:44,858
I know.

941
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:48,229
Isn't it wonderful how God has
brought us here to help us?

942
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:50,831
Help us?
Help us what?

943
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:53,725
He should be helping us break out.

944
00:52:57,474 --> 00:52:59,738
Are you OK?
Is there a problem?

945
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:01,205
Am I doing something wrong?

946
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:01,843
Huh?

947
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:04,213
You haven't even tried to touch me.

948
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:06,540
You just told me you
didn't want me to.

949
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:07,512
I thought you'd at least try.

950
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:10,743
I didn't take you here to molest you.
I just wanted to talk to you.

951
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:13,149
You're not even attracted
to me, are you?

952
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,221
I think you're absolutely adorable.

953
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:16,686
Then kiss me.

954
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:18,861
I want to know what its like.

955
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:20,928
You've never been kissed before?

956
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:22,457
No.

957
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:25,163
Just kiss me, please.

958
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:26,698
I can't!

959
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:28,063
Forget about the promise.

960
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:29,603
It's not about the promise.

961
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:32,366
It's about this fucked up place.

962
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:34,041
We should get back.

963
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:37,213
Why? Are we just hanging
out so we can make out?

964
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:38,745
No.

965
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:41,943
What else could we do?

966
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,779
Well, we could talk about
this sick place.

967
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:49,618
We can talk about who we really
are. We can talk about...

968
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:50,485
Sick?

969
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:53,288
This place is here to help us become
who God wants us to be.

970
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:56,795
Yeah. You go on and
find out who that is.

971
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,434
I'm already what God wants me to be.

972
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,631
And where are you going
tonight mister?

973
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:03,897
My first online date.

974
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:07,572
Oh look our little boy's getting
all dressed up for a trick.

975
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:09,972
It's like he's growing up
right before our eyes.

976
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:10,903
Shut up!

977
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:13,509
I'd say good luck, but you know
these things are kind of a given.

978
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:14,775
He's real hot too.

979
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:16,953
Yeah, if he sent you a real picture.

980
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:17,877
What do you mean?

981
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:20,448
Don't listen to the bitter,
Dear. Just go have fun,

982
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:23,386
and give it to him once
or twice for me.

983
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:24,560
Goodnight boys.

984
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,820
Oh, thanks for the help
with the profile.

985
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:28,998
That's what slutty friends are for.

986
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:32,363
Where are my pants?

987
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:33,866
Right here.

988
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:35,471
Thank you

989
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:39,875
Oh, hey!

990
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,175
I guess we bumped into
each other after all.

991
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:44,710
Hey!
Nice to see you again.

992
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:50,675
Yeah, I gotta go to work.

993
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:54,721
Hopefully we bump into
each other again.

994
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,482
Yeah sure.

995
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:09,902
Paul?

996
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:14,642
You look just like your picture.

997
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:17,505
I need a drink.

998
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:20,673
Cranberry vodka.

999
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:21,873
Alright.

1000
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:23,586
You 're really cute.

1001
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:26,818
Thanks!
I see you in here a lot.

1002
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:29,685
I like the ambiance.

1003
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,051
I bet you do.

1004
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:33,588
I work down the block in the
show "Adam and Steve -

1005
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:34,786
Just The Way God Made'Em."

1006
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,863
I hear it's great.
I'd love to see it.

1007
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:41,364
I can get you comps. Give me your
number I'll call you tomorrow and

1008
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:42,230
hook it up.

1009
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:43,337
Yeah, that'd be great.

1010
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:53,581
Let me know when you wanna...

1011
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:54,681
cum.

1012
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:55,646
Yeah.

1013
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:57,386
What are you doing after work?

1014
00:55:57,721 --> 00:55:58,619
Huh?

1015
00:55:58,822 --> 00:55:59,846
The change is your tip.

1016
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:01,549
Thank you.

1017
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:04,724
I got a tip with your
name all over it.

1018
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:06,891
Thanks.
I'm already taken.

1019
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:07,961
Come on!

1020
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:11,562
Come home with me, I'll fuck you like
you've never been fucked before.

1021
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:14,236
Whoa Sparky, now you're getting
a little inappropriate.

1022
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:16,665
Just give me another drink.

1023
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:17,897
How about I give you a little water?.

1024
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,369
Why don't you just give
me a little vodka?

1025
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:21,670
Why don't you go home and sober up?

1026
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,368
Why don't you just give me
another fucking drink?

1027
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:24,410
You know I know the owner.

1028
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:25,774
Yeah, everyone knows the owner.

1029
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:27,677
Just give me another fucking drink!

1030
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:31,815
Are you fucking serious?

1031
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:33,420
Go sober up.

1032
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:29,636
Mom, Dad - I need to
tell you something.

1033
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:38,748
So, how does this usually start?

1034
00:57:40,924 --> 00:57:43,449
How do you want it to start?

1035
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:45,125
This is all about you.

1036
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:50,957
Well...

1037
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:52,464
Would you like me to undress for you?

1038
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:53,962
Sure.

1039
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:07,573
So, tell me about yourself.

1040
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:08,918
Sure.

1041
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,516
What would you like to know?

1042
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:17,082
Where are you from?
Why do you do this?

1043
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:22,925
Well, I'm from Washington.
Seattle, actually.

1044
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:27,831
I go to NYU.
And this is how I pay for it.

1045
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:30,000
Nothing crazy or anything.

1046
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:32,201
Does your family know you do this?

1047
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:34,702
No. They do know I'm gay though.

1048
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:36,911
Are you seeing anyone?

1049
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:38,080
Yes.

1050
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,040
Does he know?

1051
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:44,213
How would you like a massage?

1052
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:47,620
Sure.

1053
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:05,033
Isn't this whole thing
strange for you?

1054
00:59:05,808 --> 00:59:08,208
It was... at first.

1055
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:13,207
And you probably end up
sleeping with fat old men.

1056
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:18,210
Sometimes I get to sleep with
hot young guys like you.

1057
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:22,553
Do you sleep with hot
young guys a lot?

1058
00:59:23,092 --> 00:59:28,155
A lot of young guys just don't wanna
deal with dating or meeting anyone.

1059

my parents I'm gay.

Good.

back in a few months to do it again.

1224
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:35,253
OK.

1225
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:36,786
Oh, I can't leave yet.

1226
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:39,995
They want to take me back and give
me a counseling session in a few.

1227
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:42,523
Teach me about safe sex.

1228
01:11:42,731 --> 01:11:44,926
No problem.
I can wait.

01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:47,894
Thank you so much for coming with me.

1230
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:51,668
I'm glad you're OK.

1231
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:57,939
So...

1232
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,277
I met a cute boy last night.

1233
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:01,414
Oh, me too!

1234
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:02,845
Mine sang me a song.

1235
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:04,041
Mine's a Mormon.

1236
01:12:06,088 --> 01:12:08,989
I think we're both pretty
damn pathetic.

1237
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,985
I think I like being pathetic.

1238
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:17,698
Eddie, you wanna come back now?

1239
01:12:27,443 --> 01:12:28,637
David?

1240
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:03,601
I can't believe we're doing this.

1241
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,879
We said we were going to be here.

1242
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:09,278
We can't miss the biggest
opening night of his life.

1243
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:13,717
Even if the whole show
just seems so wrong?

1244
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:21,688
I am just as troubled by all of this
as you are, but he's still our son.

1245
01:13:29,872 --> 01:13:31,362
Hey everyone.

1246
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:34,633
Now remember Patty has a new
song at the end of the show.

1247
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:37,874
I can't believe they're adding
a new song opening night.

1248
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,844
They don't call it 'off-Broadway'
for nothing.

1249
01:13:44,853 --> 01:13:47,515
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to opening night

1250
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:50,385
of "Adam and Steve - Just
the Way God Made'Em!"

1251
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:54,084
Before we begin, we must inform you
that the coalition of Christians

1252
01:13:54,296 --> 01:13:55,991
has rated our show "FLAMlNG."

1253
01:13:56,198 --> 01:14:00,362
This doesn't mean we condone or
encourage the homosexual lifestyle.

1254
01:14:00,569 --> 01:14:02,867
It just means that if
you enjoy our show,

1255
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:06,507
You'll end up burning in
Hell right next to us!

1256
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:14,672
God? If you're listening,
we need some help!

1257
01:14:14,883 --> 01:14:17,317
I'm frightened Adam, I'm frightened!

1258
01:14:17,519 --> 01:14:19,783
We're lost in the woods and we don't
know where we're supposed to be going.

1259
01:14:19,988 --> 01:14:21,478
Hello!

1260
01:14:26,829 --> 01:14:30,128
Are you a good witch or a bad witch?

1261
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:32,463
Why, I'm not a witch at all.

1262
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:34,829
I'm your guardian angel,

1263
01:14:35,037 --> 01:14:36,061
Dorothy.

1264
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:38,804
An angel? Did God send you
here to bring us to Hell?

1265
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:43,509
No Dear. He sent me here to
bring you to New York City.

1266
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:46,477
New York City is God's favorite city,

1267
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:50,777
but you can't go there
shirtless. Here!

1268
01:14:53,555 --> 01:14:54,852
Wear these.

1269
01:14:55,057 --> 01:14:56,490
Aren't they a little small?

1270
01:14:56,692 --> 01:15:00,093
Trust me, Steve.
It'll look divine!

1271
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:03,996
These do look good.

1272
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:06,226
You look great.

1273
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:07,465
You too.

1274
01:15:07,703 --> 01:15:09,830
Did you think I would steer you wrong?

1275
01:15:10,038 --> 01:15:13,872
After all, you're both
friends of Dorothy now.

1276
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:15,370
Can I ask you a question?

1277
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:16,508
Of course, Steve.

1278
01:15:16,712 --> 01:15:18,680
Does God hate us because we're gay?

1279
01:15:19,615 --> 01:15:21,742
Honey, how could you even think that?

1280
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:27,018
? God made all different
types of people ?

1281
01:15:27,222 --> 01:15:29,747
? with different jobs to do. ?

1282
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:33,086
? He made all of the breeders ?

1283
01:15:33,295 --> 01:15:36,492
? to make more gays
like you and you. ?

1284
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:39,132
? So sure, they might be jealous. ?

1285
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:42,231
? Don 't listen to what they say. ?

1286
01:15:42,638 --> 01:15:45,835
? You're just the way he made you. ?

1287
01:15:46,074 --> 01:15:48,770
? God loves gays. ?

1288
01:15:48,977 --> 01:15:51,810
? God loves gays. ?

1289
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:54,676
? God loves gays. ?

1290
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:57,750
? Each one of you is special ?

1291
01:15:57,953 --> 01:16:00,649
? in your own way. ?

1292
01:16:00,856 --> 01:16:03,825
? Some people are gays in hiding. ?

1293
01:16:04,026 --> 01:16:06,256
? They're the ones
who love to shout. ?

1294
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:10,156
? They need to know God loves them ?

1295
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:13,091
? to help them with
their coming out. ?

1296
01:16:13,635 --> 01:16:16,536
God is going to send you
to the fires of Hell!

1297
01:16:20,142 --> 01:16:22,736
? God loves gays, Honey. ?

1298
01:16:22,945 --> 01:16:24,412
Being gay is an abomination,

1299
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:26,705
and the only thing worse than
being an abomination...

1300
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:28,314
is being a Jew.

1301
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:35,757
? God loves gays, Mary. ?

1302
01:16:44,199 --> 01:16:50,570
? God madly loves the gays. ?

1303
01:17:26,408 --> 01:17:29,206
? God loves gays. ?

1304
01:17:29,945 --> 01:17:31,378
? God loves gays. ?

1305
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:32,371
? Yes he does. ?

1306
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:35,079
? Each one ofyou is special ?

1307
01:17:35,283 --> 01:17:40,050
? in your own gay way, ?

1308
01:17:40,355 --> 01:17:42,823
? and it doesn 't matter ?

1309
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:46,027
? if you are butch or fey. ?

1310
01:17:46,228 --> 01:17:49,720
? Stay just the way he made you. ?

1311
01:17:50,232 --> 01:17:52,666
? God loves gays, Honey. ?

1312
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:55,401
? God loves gays, Mary. ?

1313
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:58,295
? No matter what yourjob is, ?

1314
01:17:58,707 --> 01:18:01,198
? He loves you the way you are. ?

1315
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:04,777
? You can be a politician ?

1316
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:07,676
? or working in a leather bar. ?

1317
01:18:07,883 --> 01:18:10,875
? God loves all He created ?

1318
01:18:11,086 --> 01:18:13,714
? no matter what people say. ?

1319
01:18:13,922 --> 01:18:17,050
? Stay just the way He made you ?

1320
01:18:17,259 --> 01:18:18,351
? cause ?

1321
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,785
? He loves you. ?

1322
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:23,726
? He loves you. ?

1323
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:27,891
? He loves you. ?

1324
01:18:30,806 --> 01:18:42,081
? He LOOOOO... ?

1325
01:18:46,755 --> 01:18:51,886
? HE LOOOOV.ES...?

1326
01:18:54,029 --> 01:19:02,698
? GAYS! ?

1327
01:19:06,141 --> 01:19:08,302
I was up for that part.

1328
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:13,714
I think I'm gonna like it here.

1329
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:15,849
There are so many
friends of Dorothy here.

1330
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:18,215
You know what this journey
has taught me?

1331
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:19,352
What?

1332
01:19:20,922 --> 01:19:23,413
That I want you in my life forever.

1333
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,427
Steve?

1334
01:19:28,497 --> 01:19:29,486
Will you marry me?

1335
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:31,398
Of course I will.

1336
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:36,794
No, no, no! You can't do this.
This is an abomination.

1337
01:19:37,005 --> 01:19:41,942
The Lord God said that two men should
not sleep in the same bed.

1338
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:45,043
It is Adam and Eve,
notAdam and Steve.

1339
01:19:45,247 --> 01:19:47,442
If God were here right now,
what would He say?

1340
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:49,316
Why don't you just ask me?

1341
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:51,008
Who are you supposed to be?

1342
01:19:51,219 --> 01:19:53,847
What did they expect? God!

1343
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:58,085
The Father.
The man upstairs.

1344
01:19:59,094 --> 01:20:00,118
Watch this.

1345
01:20:00,929 --> 01:20:02,920
Let there be darkness.

1346
01:20:03,932 --> 01:20:06,833
I said LETTHERE BE DARKNESS!

1347
01:20:07,335 --> 01:20:08,893
Now watch this - my favorite part.

1348
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:11,436
Why the fuck is it so dark down here?

1349
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:20,273
If you are God, then you know it's
Adam and Eve, notAdam and Steve.

1350
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:22,814
You shouldn't believe
everything you read.

1351
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:24,986
But your book specifically says...

1352
01:20:25,954 --> 01:20:29,185
My book?
Who said it was my book?

1353
01:20:29,424 --> 01:20:32,393
What do you think,
I faxed it down here?

1354
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:35,191
It was written by man.

1355
01:20:35,397 --> 01:20:38,093
It was interpreted by man.

1356
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:40,995
It was abused by man.

1357
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:43,296
I never told people to hurt and kill.

1358
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:45,063
I told everyone to Iove.

1359
01:20:45,273 --> 01:20:48,140
You mean, you love the gays?

1360
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:50,538
Didn't you just hear the last song?

1361
01:20:51,313 --> 01:20:53,873
Maybe we were wrong.

1362
01:20:55,884 --> 01:20:59,411
I'm so sorry we tried to change you.

1363
01:21:00,121 --> 01:21:01,281
Can you ever forgive us?

1364
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:02,513
Of course I can.

1365
01:21:02,924 --> 01:21:04,983
I love you both so much.

1366
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,385
I guess we were wrong.

1367
01:21:12,267 --> 01:21:14,201
Forgive me

1368
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:18,495
? I didn't realize 'til now ?

1369
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:25,038
?that our cold, self-righteous
words could hurt you so. ?

1370
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:29,115
? I was taught very young, ?

1371
01:21:29,317 --> 01:21:32,616
? by those who came before me, ?

1372
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:35,546
? to fear and condemn ?

1373
01:21:35,957 --> 01:21:38,926
? the things I don 't know. ?

1374
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:42,585
? There is fear in the hearts ?

1375
01:21:42,998 --> 01:21:45,990
? of those who would change you. ?

1376
01:21:46,201 --> 01:21:52,470
? Fear of the light that
shines from you. ?

1377
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:58,938
? They don't know that light
was designed by God, ?

1378
01:21:59,147 --> 01:22:05,052
? who gave it a brilliant
and beautiful hue. ?

1379
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:08,620
? And to those who would change you, ?

1380
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:11,492
? or send you away, ?

1381
01:22:11,693 --> 01:22:17,893
? you must proudly stand
your ground and say, ?

1382
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:23,332
? I was put on this Earth as I am. ?

1383
01:22:24,205 --> 01:22:30,474
? I was born with my own
special blessings. ?

1384
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:36,549
? I let them shine
and not give a damn. ?

1385
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:44,620
? I was put on this Earth as I am. ?

1386
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:50,495
? There is envy in those ?

1387
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:53,532
? who recklessly judge you, ?

1388
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:59,696
? wishing their hearts
could love like yours. ?

1389
01:23:00,141 --> 01:23:05,977
? They don't understand,
they can reach within, ?

1390
01:23:06,214 --> 01:23:11,584
? and find all the love,
forgiveness restores. ?

1391
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:17,584
? And to those who condemn you
with fury and shame, ?

1392
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:24,057
?you must strongly plant
your feet and proclaim, ?

1393
01:23:24,265 --> 01:23:29,498
? I was put on this Earth as I am. ?

1394
01:23:30,105 --> 01:23:35,702
? I was put here to live
as His creation, ?

1395
01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:42,016
? and I know I'm loved
in virtue and sin. ?

1396
01:23:42,217 --> 01:23:47,450
? I'm calm and content
within my own skin. ?

1397
01:23:47,655 --> 01:23:53,355
? I was put on this Earth as I am. ?

1398
01:23:53,561 --> 01:23:59,397
? I was born with my own
special blessings. ?

1399
01:23:59,634 --> 01:24:05,072
? I let them shine and
not give a damn. ?

1400
01:24:05,306 --> 01:24:09,402
? I was put on this Earth ?

1401
01:24:10,311 --> 01:24:17,376
? as I am! ?

1402
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:27,185
Is there anything you wanna
say to each other?.

1403
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:30,626
You know, marriage is
a commitment of love.

1404
01:24:30,832 --> 01:24:35,030
It's the binding together of your
two souls throughout eternity.

1405
01:24:35,236 --> 01:24:38,603
Don 't ever make this commitment
unless you sure you're ready.

1406
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:43,238
You know I love you,
but are you ready?

1407
01:24:43,445 --> 01:24:46,073
If not, I'm willing to wait.

1408
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:49,079
My whole life, I've wondered
what was wrong with me.

1409
01:24:49,284 --> 01:24:51,775
The problem was that I hated myself.

1410
01:24:52,187 --> 01:24:55,418
And it made me feel so alone.

1411
01:24:55,623 --> 01:24:57,784
You will never be alone again.

1412
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:01,060
You showed me how to love myself,

1413
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:03,162
and now I'm ready to love you.

1414
01:25:03,531 --> 01:25:05,328
I'm so ready.

1415
01:25:05,533 --> 01:25:08,661
Our little Steven is getting married.

1416
01:25:09,804 --> 01:25:13,365
? You'll neverbe alone. ?

1417
01:25:13,575 --> 01:25:15,475
? I'll always be here foryou. ?

1418
01:25:15,677 --> 01:25:19,078
? You'll neverbe alone. ?

1419
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,248
? I'll always love you, ?

1420
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:24,543
? and I'll be faithful to you. ?

1421
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,145
? Then with my blessing, ?

1422
01:25:27,589 --> 01:25:30,387
? and as the angels sing with glee, ?

1423
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:32,786
? I'll call you one now ?

1424
01:25:33,628 --> 01:25:36,358
? through all eternity. ?

1425
01:25:36,564 --> 01:25:42,628
? You'll never be alone! ?

1426
01:25:42,837 --> 01:25:44,202
I love you, Adam.

1427
01:25:44,405 --> 01:25:45,372
I love you, Steve.

1428
01:25:45,573 --> 01:25:47,541
And they're just the way I made'em!

1429
01:26:05,059 --> 01:26:06,253
That's our son!

1430
01:26:06,561 --> 01:26:07,755
That's our son!

1431
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:36,555
Thanks.

1432
01:26:58,580 --> 01:27:00,946
We are so proud of you.
