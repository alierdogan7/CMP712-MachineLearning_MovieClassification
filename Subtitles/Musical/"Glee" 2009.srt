1
00:00:04,361 --> 00:00:06,796
Honey...

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,066
you're never gonna believe
what I did today.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,336
I decided to take
over the Glee Club.

(school bell ringing)
KURT:<i> My name is Kurt Hummel.</i>

6
00:00:26,283 --> 00:00:27,516
<i>I'm a sophomore at McKinley.</i>

7
00:00:27,551 --> 00:00:29,485
<i>My first day at this school,</i>

8
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,253
<i>the principal got up in front
of the whole freshman class</i>

9
00:00:31,288 --> 00:00:33,055
<i>and told us that
the next four years</i>

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,857
<i>were going to be the best years
of our lives.</i>

11
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:36,258
Out of the way, fag!

12
00:00:36,293 --> 00:00:37,526
<i>What a joke.</i>

13
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:39,195
Sorry.

14
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:41,530
Hope I didn't make you late
for remedial math.

15
00:00:41,565 --> 00:00:43,733
What was that?

16
00:00:43,767 --> 00:00:46,235
Nothing. I just...
I just said I was sorry.

17
00:00:48,638 --> 00:00:50,039
(kicks books)

18
00:00:52,042 --> 00:00:53,409
Nice.

19
00:00:53,443 --> 00:00:55,277
Hey, bro, don't be gay.

20
00:00:55,312 --> 00:00:59,482
KURT:<i> Another day, another</i>
<i>cataclysmic humiliation.</i>

21
00:01:01,485 --> 00:01:04,954
<i>Everywhere I go,
I'm isolated and alone.</i>

22
00:01:04,988 --> 00:01:07,308
<i>I know my mom used to tell me
how good it made her feel</i>

23
00:01:07,324 --> 00:01:08,891
<i>that I was such a happy kid,</i>

24
00:01:08,925 --> 00:01:10,726
<i>but honestly,
I don't even remember</i>

25
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:13,095
<i>what that would've
even felt like.</i>

26
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,864
<i>I feel like I could die tomorrow</i>

27
00:01:14,898 --> 00:01:16,866
<i>and I don't think
anyone would really care.</i>

28
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,336
<i>I'm not sure
anyone would even notice.</i>

29
00:01:24,975 --> 00:01:26,575
EMMA:
Can I help you?

30
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,210
Oh! No. I'm-I'm sorry.

31
00:01:28,245 --> 00:01:29,445
I-I just made a wrong turn.

32
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:31,147
What's your name?
Kurt Hummel.

33
00:01:31,181 --> 00:01:33,849
Hi, Kurt. I'm Miss Pillsbury,
the guidance counselor.

34
00:01:36,153 --> 00:01:38,154
Are you new to the school?
I'm a sophomore.

35
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:39,255
That's awkward.

36
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:41,557
Well, if you ever need anything,

37
00:01:41,591 --> 00:01:42,892
my door is always open.

38
00:01:42,926 --> 00:01:44,393
(quietly): One, two,
three, four, five.

39
00:01:44,428 --> 00:01:46,762
Because feelings don't
take vacations, do they?

40
00:01:46,797 --> 00:01:48,064
They work in 24-hour shifts.

41
00:01:48,098 --> 00:01:49,565
I mean, I don't.

42
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm only here during
regular school hours.

43
00:01:51,034 --> 00:01:52,668
And I take vacation.

44
00:01:52,703 --> 00:01:54,270
I try not to eat into
my sick days...

45
00:01:54,304 --> 00:01:56,464
It was nice meeting you.
Yeah, it was nice meeting you.

46
00:01:56,473 --> 00:01:57,707
Mm-hmm.

47
00:02:07,684 --> 00:02:09,685
(school bell ringing)

48
00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:17,660
What is that on your hands
and your coveralls?

49
00:02:17,694 --> 00:02:20,096
What would you call that?
Is that oil? Is that grease?

50
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,690
Down at the shop,
we just call it grime.

51
00:02:21,698 --> 00:02:23,966
Grime.
Look, I know why

52
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:25,001
you asked me down here.

53
00:02:25,002 --> 00:02:26,969
Oh, you do? Oh. Oh, dear.

54
00:02:27,004 --> 00:02:28,204
Is Kurt acting
strangely at home?

55
00:02:28,238 --> 00:02:29,772
Yeah, since he was two.

56
00:02:29,806 --> 00:02:31,474
Look, I know he's a
little bit different,

57
00:02:31,508 --> 00:02:33,109
but I also think
it's a little early

58
00:02:33,143 --> 00:02:34,343
to be talking about it.

59
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:35,618
I mean, kids,

60
00:02:35,646 --> 00:02:37,113
they grow out of
stuff all the time.

61
00:02:37,147 --> 00:02:38,781
When I was his age,
I was a Bengals fan.

62
00:02:38,815 --> 00:02:40,316
Now I'm a Browns fan,

63
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,118
all the way.
No, sorry,

64
00:02:42,152 --> 00:02:44,153
I don't think we're talking
about the same thing.

65
00:02:44,187 --> 00:02:47,323
Um, I'm worried
that Kurt is, uh...

66
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:48,724
depressed.

67
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,126
Oh.
No, deeply.

68
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,694
And I'm concerned about him.

69
00:02:51,728 --> 00:02:55,665
Look, I-I walked in on him,
and he was reading this.

70
00:03:07,611 --> 00:03:08,844
Hey.

71
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,079
What's up?

72
00:03:10,113 --> 00:03:11,981
Nothing.

73
00:03:12,015 --> 00:03:13,649
Is it time for me
to start dinner?

74
00:03:13,684 --> 00:03:15,551
Uh, in a minute.

75
00:03:15,585 --> 00:03:17,353
I, uh...

76
00:03:17,387 --> 00:03:19,747
I got called into school by
your guidance counselor today.

77
00:03:22,292 --> 00:03:27,363
She told me...
some upsetting stuff.

78
00:03:27,397 --> 00:03:29,899
I'm fine, Dad.

79
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:31,901
She's... she's just
overreacting.

80
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:33,502
Look, Kurt, I don't want to talk

81
00:03:33,537 --> 00:03:35,738
about this any more
than you do. Okay?

82
00:03:35,772 --> 00:03:38,441
You do your thing, I do mine.

83
00:03:38,475 --> 00:03:43,045
But you're all alone down here,
most of the time.

84
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,014
You don't have any friends.

85
00:03:45,048 --> 00:03:46,248
You don't understand.

86
00:03:46,283 --> 00:03:47,683
School is very complicated
for me.

87
00:03:47,718 --> 00:03:50,453
I was a teenager;
I get the pressure.

88
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:53,756
Making friends... that's why
I joined the football team.

89
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,259
You want me to join
the football team?

90
00:03:56,293 --> 00:03:57,927
Look, I'm not asking here, Kurt.

91
00:03:57,961 --> 00:03:59,362
This is an order.

92
00:03:59,396 --> 00:04:02,198
By the end of this week,
I want you on a team,

93
00:04:02,232 --> 00:04:04,192
or I'm taking away
the sewing machine.

94
00:04:05,902 --> 00:04:07,870
(school bell ringing)

95
00:04:07,904 --> 00:04:09,906
(lively chatter)

96
00:04:31,428 --> 00:04:33,162
May I sit here?

97
00:04:33,196 --> 00:04:34,597
Be careful with the posters.

98
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:36,299
They take 20 minutes each
to make.

99
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,600
Okay.

100
00:04:37,634 --> 00:04:39,302
I see you're in the Speech Club.

101
00:04:39,336 --> 00:04:41,070
Speech Club, Renaissance Club,

102
00:04:41,104 --> 00:04:43,239
the Muslim Students Club,
Black Student Union.

103
00:04:43,273 --> 00:04:45,353
It's important for me to be
immersed in all cultures.

104
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,909
I'm an actress.

105
00:04:46,944 --> 00:04:49,111
Oh, I know. I've seen
your videos on MySpace.

106
00:04:49,146 --> 00:04:50,346
You're very talented.

107
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,481
I'm Rachel Berry.

108
00:04:52,516 --> 00:04:54,317
Kurt Hummel.

109
00:04:54,351 --> 00:04:56,752
Well, perhaps I should
join the Speech Club.

110
00:04:56,787 --> 00:04:59,155
My-my dad's making me
join something.

111
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:00,523
And to be honest with you,
I have also been

112
00:05:00,557 --> 00:05:01,958
toying around
with a career in acting.

113
00:05:01,992 --> 00:05:03,759
I'm not toying around
with anything.

114
00:05:03,794 --> 00:05:05,461
The minute I graduate, I'm
going directly to Broadway

115
00:05:05,495 --> 00:05:07,430
and I'm never looking back.

116
00:05:07,464 --> 00:05:08,998
Besides, you can't join
the Speech Club; it's full.

117
00:05:09,032 --> 00:05:12,168
- Oh.
- Can you carry a tune?

118
00:05:12,202 --> 00:05:13,202
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

119
00:05:13,237 --> 00:05:14,837
- Yes.
- Because I don't know

120
00:05:14,871 --> 00:05:16,439
if you've heard the good
news, but the Glee Club

121
00:05:16,473 --> 00:05:17,840
is starting up again. It was
really awful when that perv,

122
00:05:17,874 --> 00:05:19,208
Mr. Ryerson, was in charge,

123
00:05:19,243 --> 00:05:20,543
but Mr. Schuester
is taking over now.

124
00:05:20,577 --> 00:05:22,144
He's the really
cool Spanish teacher

125
00:05:22,179 --> 00:05:24,146
who looks like an old
Justin Timberlake.

126
00:05:24,181 --> 00:05:25,781
When he was in this school
and he was in the Glee Club,

127
00:05:25,816 --> 00:05:27,550
they won nationals.
Do you know how hard that is?

128
00:05:27,584 --> 00:05:29,352
I'm assuming that you're
a contralto or a mezzo-soprano.

129
00:05:29,386 --> 00:05:31,020
We'll explore your vocal range
tomorrow after school.

130
00:05:31,054 --> 00:05:32,321
I'll reserve the auditorium.

131
00:05:33,423 --> 00:05:35,057

(laughs) That was incredible!

184
00:07:43,554 --> 00:07:45,254
That is definitely the song
that we need to sing

185
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:46,489
when we audition together.

186
00:07:46,523 --> 00:07:48,257
Together?
I'm sorry, Kurt,

187
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:49,926
it-it doesn't
work that way.

188
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,161
When you look at the sky
at night, what do you see?

189
00:07:52,196 --> 00:07:53,930
Um... stars?

190
00:07:53,964 --> 00:07:56,032
Exactly.
Some shine brighter than others,

191
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:57,633
but they all shine on their own.

192
00:07:57,668 --> 00:07:59,268
I enjoyed singing with you today

193
00:07:59,303 --> 00:08:00,837
and I look forward
to doing it again,

194
00:08:00,871 --> 00:08:02,371
but when it comes to auditions,

195
00:08:02,406 --> 00:08:04,474
it's every man for himself
on this stage.

196
00:08:04,508 --> 00:08:05,875
Eat or be eaten.

197
00:08:08,178 --> 00:08:10,913
This is show choir.

198
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:16,052
(school bell ringing)

199
00:08:17,855 --> 00:08:19,856
Oh! Um, hi.

200
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,124
- Uh, Miss Jones?
- That's me.

201
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:24,293
I-I'm Kurt Hummel.

202
00:08:24,328 --> 00:08:25,661
Mm-hmm. Kurt Hummel.

203
00:08:25,696 --> 00:08:27,029
And what do you want?

204
00:08:27,064 --> 00:08:28,498
We're walking, we're talking.

205
00:08:28,532 --> 00:08:29,999
Well, I heard that you
were a-a total star

206
00:08:30,033 --> 00:08:31,467
in your church choir
and that you cracked

207
00:08:31,502 --> 00:08:33,035
a stained glass window
when you hit a high note

208
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,904
singing ♪ Jesus. ♪

209
00:08:34,938 --> 00:08:37,140
Well, that's how you get
the big man upstairs' attention.

210
00:08:37,174 --> 00:08:39,654
Well, I want to be
just like you.

211
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:44,881
Kurt, you are...
you're adorable.

212
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:46,716
But I just don't think
that this pale, sexy,

213
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,218
Keebler Elf look really fits in
with my church choir.

214
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:50,486
I mean, no offense.

215
00:08:50,521 --> 00:08:51,721
Oh, no, no.
None taken.

216
00:08:51,755 --> 00:08:52,995
No, no, not a church.

217
00:08:53,023 --> 00:08:54,557
Uh, here, in the new Glee Club.

218
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:56,259
Haven't you heard?

219
00:08:56,293 --> 00:08:58,828
Why wait for Sundays to be
Aretha Franklin and Beyoncé

220
00:08:58,862 --> 00:09:00,496
and Donna Summer
when you can do it

221
00:09:00,531 --> 00:09:02,698
every day right here at
William McKinley High School?

222
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:04,233
Miss Jones is listening.

223
00:09:04,268 --> 00:09:05,701
Well, I-I want to audition,

224
00:09:05,736 --> 00:09:07,203
but I'm a-a nobody, you know?

225
00:09:07,237 --> 00:09:09,237
You know, I don't know
what song to sing,

226
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:10,907
I don't know what to do
with my hands when I'm singing,

227
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:12,842
I don't know how to
move all cool, like...

228
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:15,945
like you do, because...
because you're you,

229
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:18,181
and, well, I'm-I'm...

230
00:09:18,215 --> 00:09:19,849
I'm this.

231
00:09:19,883 --> 00:09:22,585
But inside, I'm-I'm more.

232
00:09:22,619 --> 00:09:24,520
Okay.

233
00:09:24,555 --> 00:09:25,888
I will help.

234
00:09:25,923 --> 00:09:27,256
First tip:

235
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,358
you have an incredibly loud
sense of fashion...

236
00:09:29,393 --> 00:09:30,893
Which, you know, respect.

237
00:09:30,928 --> 00:09:32,728
But I see the way
that you slink around

238
00:09:32,763 --> 00:09:34,363
at this school.
Mm-hmm.

239
00:09:34,398 --> 00:09:36,299
It's time for your attitude
to match your outfits.

240
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,301
I guess I just feel safer

241
00:09:38,335 --> 00:09:40,036
if I let all the clothes
do the talking.

242
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,270
In a way, it lets me
feel invisible.

243
00:09:41,305 --> 00:09:42,738
Not anymore.

244
00:09:42,773 --> 00:09:44,707
I think I might know
the perfect song for you.

245
00:09:44,741 --> 00:09:46,542
KURT:
<i>Hello, I'm Kurt Hummel</i>

246
00:09:46,577 --> 00:09:47,944
<i>and I'll be singing
"Mr. Cellophane."</i>

247
00:09:47,978 --> 00:09:49,578

Thank you. That was...
that was really nice.

259
00:10:22,846 --> 00:10:24,847
(power tools whirring)

260
00:10:28,786 --> 00:10:30,353
KURT:
Hey, Dad!

261
00:10:30,387 --> 00:10:32,088
- I did it.
- Huh?

262
00:10:32,122 --> 00:10:34,757
- I joined a team.
- Hey, hey! All right!

263
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:36,626
There we go, Kurt!
Which one?

264
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,928
- The Glee Club.
- What's Glee Club?

265
00:10:38,962 --> 00:10:41,097
It's amazing. We-we
sing and we dance

266
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:44,033
and it's full of inducing
community-based activities.

267
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:46,202
Look, uh, Kurt...

268
00:10:46,236 --> 00:10:48,204
it's not like I got
a problem with it.

269
00:10:48,238 --> 00:10:52,008
I'm all for singing and dancing,
but the point of this

270
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:55,211
was for you to feel
what it's like to bond

271
00:10:55,245 --> 00:10:57,380
over a shared goal.

272
00:10:57,414 --> 00:10:59,215
Well, Glee Club
is-is kind of like that.

273
00:10:59,249 --> 00:11:00,883
At the end of the term,
we-we perform

274
00:11:00,918 --> 00:11:02,718
at this big competition
in front of an audience.

275
00:11:02,753 --> 00:11:04,387
Against other schools, you know?

276
00:11:04,421 --> 00:11:06,055
So it really is
like a sports team?

277
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,557
Yeah, yeah, uh, kind of.

278
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:09,325
Except with choreography
and Beyoncé.

279
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:11,160
Who's Beyoncé? She one of
the girls on the team?

280
00:11:11,195 --> 00:11:14,197
No, Dad, she's, like, the
biggest pop star in the world.

281
00:11:14,231 --> 00:11:15,798
Oh.
I mean, we-we could use

282
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,734
a-a strong male lead,

283
00:11:17,768 --> 00:11:22,205
but... I really think it's-it's
gonna be something special.

284
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,240
Okay, good.

285
00:11:24,274 --> 00:11:25,908
This is good.

286
00:11:25,943 --> 00:11:27,477
I still think it'd do you good

287
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:30,179
to be part of
a real sports team, but...

288
00:11:30,214 --> 00:11:31,981
well, you seem happy.

289
00:11:32,015 --> 00:11:37,220
Honestly, Dad, I don't
think I've ever been this

290
00:11:37,254 --> 00:11:39,522
genuinely excited
to go to school.

291
00:11:39,556 --> 00:11:41,624
Thanks for
pushing me to do this.

292
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:49,911
Thanks for showing up
for yourself.

293
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:52,001
MAN:
Hey, Burt!

294
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:53,936
Yeah?

295
00:11:56,073 --> 00:11:57,507
What?

296
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,275
KURT:
<i>I'm gay, Dad.</i>

297
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:02,011
<i>Please don't stop loving me,
but I'm gay.</i>

298
00:12:02,046 --> 00:12:03,746
We good?

299
00:12:03,781 --> 00:12:05,281
I got to go deal with this.

300
00:12:05,315 --> 00:12:07,583
Yeah... yeah, yeah, we're good.

301
00:12:07,618 --> 00:12:09,285
Okay.

302
00:12:12,322 --> 00:12:13,723
BURT:
Who needs me?

303
00:12:20,047 --> 00:12:22,015
(School bell ringing) MERCEDES: <i>My
name is Mercedes Jones,</i>

304
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:24,050
<i>and I don't have a lot
of friends at this school.</i>

305
00:12:24,085 --> 00:12:25,565
<i>I mean, it's not like
I get picked on,</i>

306
00:12:25,586 --> 00:12:27,554
<i>and folks are nice, I guess,</i>

307
00:12:27,588 --> 00:12:29,856
<i>but there sure are a lot of
white folks here at McKinley.</i>

308
00:12:29,891 --> 00:12:31,191
<i>I mean, there is
that one black kid,</i>

309
00:12:31,225 --> 00:12:32,392
<i>but he's real boring.</i>

310
00:12:32,426 --> 00:12:33,660
- Hey, Mercedes.
- Yeah. Hi.

311
00:12:33,694 --> 00:12:35,662
<i>I'm a big star at my church,</i>

312
00:12:35,696 --> 00:12:37,197
<i>where everybody knows
I got a big-ass voice,</i>

313
00:12:37,231 --> 00:12:39,065
<i>but here, I'm just a nobody.</i>

314
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,700
<i>But that's all gonna change
real soon</i>

315
00:12:40,735 --> 00:12:42,235
<i>because I heard
they're jump-starting</i>

316
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,837
<i>the singing club at McKinley,</i>

317
00:12:43,871 --> 00:12:47,040
<i>and Mercedes Jones has
decided to sign up.</i>

318
00:12:47,074 --> 00:12:49,609
(school bell ringing)

319
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:50,644
Excuse me, Mercedes Jones?

320
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,112
Hi, I'm Rachel Berry.

321
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,080
I saw that you signed up
for the Glee Club. Me, too.

322
00:12:54,115 --> 00:12:55,348
I can tell by
your sloppy signature

323
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:56,783
that you have
a very strong personality,

324
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,585
and I can tell by the way
that you hold your torso

325
00:12:58,619 --> 00:12:59,886
that you have
a very strong diaphragm,

326
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:01,354
which means that
you're very talented.

327
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:02,789
Which is good, because
I'm very talented, too.

328
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,224
Well, it's nice to
meet you, Rachel.

329
00:13:04,225 --> 00:13:05,759
Guess I'll be seeing
you in Glee Club.

330
00:13:05,793 --> 00:13:07,594
Here's the thing:
we're both gonna be competing

331
00:13:07,628 --> 00:13:09,796
for the female lead, which I
want us to see as a good thing.

332
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:10,897
My dads always say: the
person who's better than you,

333
00:13:10,932 --> 00:13:12,532
or maybe, in this case,

334
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:13,900
maybe the person who's
almost as good as you

335
00:13:13,935 --> 00:13:15,469
should be considered
your best friend.

336
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,237
Okay, let me just stop you
right there, because I can see

337
00:13:17,271 --> 00:13:18,638
what it is you're trying to do.
You're trying to get all

338
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,474
in my head and make me nervous
like Ike Turner

339
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,576
so you can swoop down
and get all the attention.

340
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,244
But let me tell you something.

341
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:25,645
I've been dealing with
this kind of nonsense

342
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,280
for the past three years
in my church choir,

343
00:13:27,315 --> 00:13:30,250
and I overcame it
and I'm over it.

344
00:13:30,284 --> 00:13:31,818
You go to one of those
singing black churches.

345
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,220
That's amazing.

346
00:13:33,254 --> 00:13:35,822
One of my dads is black.

347
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,757
See? Another thing
that we have in common.

348
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:39,926
What?
A black dad.

that I would not have seen

that you felt something.

what you're saying:

my audience isn't your audience.
I should've known.

Of course we did it, Autobot,

456
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:21,575
because you dared us to
and also because

457
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:22,676
we don't give a what what.

458
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,844

00:18:23,878 --> 00:18:25,078
that Rachel girl had it coming

460
00:18:25,113 --> 00:18:27,514
for making fun of my true form.

Mr. Clarkson, his werewolf
heritage is not a real ethnicity

462
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,285

to whatever roadkill he used

463
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,087

523
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,200
r-really, really good.

524
00:21:24,235 --> 00:21:25,702
I had no idea.

525
00:21:25,736 --> 00:21:27,437
- Really?
- Seriously.

526
00:21:27,471 --> 00:21:29,471
That's the best voice
I have ever heard.

527
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,611
(school bell ringing)

528
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,250
Brad.

529
00:21:40,284 --> 00:21:41,952
Welcome, everybody!

530
00:21:41,986 --> 00:21:44,387
Can I just say
what an awesome job

531
00:21:44,422 --> 00:21:47,891
you all did in your auditions.
I was... I was blown away.

532
00:21:47,925 --> 00:21:49,759
Okay, so...

533
00:21:49,794 --> 00:21:52,629
grab a pair of gloves
and some sheet music.

534
00:21:52,663 --> 00:21:55,098
"S-S-S..." "Sit Down,
You're Rockin' the Boat"

535
00:21:55,132 --> 00:21:57,467
by the legendary Frank Loesser.

536
00:21:57,501 --> 00:21:58,869
We did this at
McKinley's Christmas concert

537
00:21:58,903 --> 00:22:00,904
my sophomore year,
and we got a standing O.

538
00:22:00,938 --> 00:22:03,440
Artie, why don't
you take the lead.

539
00:22:03,474 --> 00:22:04,808
- Yes!
- Mr. Schuester.

540
00:22:04,842 --> 00:22:06,276
With all due respect,

541
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,711
I'm the only member here who was

542
00:22:07,745 --> 00:22:09,246
in Mr. Ryerson's
original Glee Club;

543
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,147
therefore, I should be
getting the first solo.

544
00:22:11,182 --> 00:22:13,049
Say what?

545
00:22:13,084 --> 00:22:15,485
It's the first song; it sets
the precedent for everything.

546
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,787
Rachel, Artie's gonna
sing the first solo, period.

547
00:22:17,822 --> 00:22:19,502
You and everyone else
are gonna have plenty

548
00:22:19,523 --> 00:22:22,092
of opportunities for a
solo; we'll all take turns.

549
00:22:22,126 --> 00:22:24,127
In fact, I was thinking
for sectionals, we would do

550
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:26,930
a medley from<i> Grease.</i>
Who wants the Sandy part?

551
00:22:26,964 --> 00:22:28,832
Is this even a
discussion right now?!

552
00:22:28,866 --> 00:22:30,834
I'm the only person in this room
who can play Sandy!

553
00:22:30,868 --> 00:22:33,069
- Why? Because you're white?
- RACHEL: Okay, I wouldn't dream

554
00:22:33,104 --> 00:22:36,106
of being Mrs. Saigon
or black Dorothy from the Wiz,

555
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,620
but if we want to be taken
seriously as a glee club,

556
00:22:38,643 --> 00:22:40,176
then it can't be about color
or disability or whatever.

557
00:22:40,211 --> 00:22:42,245
It has to be about who
has the best voice.

558
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,281
Exactly. That would be me.

559
00:22:47,351 --> 00:22:48,418
Let's warm up.

560
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:49,692
Brad.

561
00:22:52,723 --> 00:22:54,724
(vacuum whirring)

562
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,064
(vacuum stops)

563
00:23:04,502 --> 00:23:05,969
I thought you were
finishing up out here?

564
00:23:06,003 --> 00:23:08,004
I-I was just taking
a little break.

565
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,399
You just left
the vacuum cleaner on

566
00:23:09,407 --> 00:23:10,807
so that I would think
you were cleaning

567
00:23:10,842 --> 00:23:12,442
while you were goofing off
with the sheet music.

568
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:15,278
(sighs) There is a division
of labor in this house, Will.

569
00:23:15,313 --> 00:23:16,813
You do the cooking and cleaning,

570
00:23:16,848 --> 00:23:18,815
and I will carry our children
when we have them.

571
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,517
Which might not be anytime soon

572
00:23:20,551 --> 00:23:22,485
because I'm sure all this
extra free work you're doing

573
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,020
for the Glee Club
is tiring you out

574
00:23:24,055 --> 00:23:25,789
and making your sperm stressed.

575
00:23:25,823 --> 00:23:27,190
You're right.

576
00:23:27,225 --> 00:23:29,192
I am stressed.

577
00:23:29,227 --> 00:23:32,028
And I'm sure my sperm's stressed, too.
Mm-hmm.

578
00:23:32,063 --> 00:23:34,130
The Glee Club is one day old,
and there's already in-fighting.

579
00:23:34,165 --> 00:23:36,733
(sighs) Which is
kind of my fault,

580
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:38,368
because I asked
who wanted the first solo,

581
00:23:38,402 --> 00:23:40,337
and Rachel and Mercedes
both raised their hands,

582
00:23:40,371 --> 00:23:41,838
and I don't want to
disappoint either of them.

583
00:23:41,873 --> 00:23:43,874
Just give it to whichever one
is the most pathetic.

584
00:23:43,908 --> 00:23:46,309
It's much harder to be jealous
of someone when you think

585
00:23:46,344 --> 00:23:47,911
you're better than they are.

586
00:23:47,945 --> 00:23:49,813
Even if they get something
that you want.

587
00:23:49,847 --> 00:23:51,414
I love it when you're all smart.

588
00:23:51,449 --> 00:23:53,016
Oh. (Giggles)

589
00:23:55,953 --> 00:23:58,421
I'm only gonna
ask you this once,

590
00:23:58,456 --> 00:24:01,725
and then I promise I will never
bring up the Glee Club again.

591
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:04,060
Okay.

592
00:24:04,095 --> 00:24:06,229
Is it worth it?

593
00:24:06,264 --> 00:24:07,864
I mean, you know
I'm a little bit psychic.

594
00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:09,566
I have a bad feeling about this.

595
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,369
How could anything bad
come out of a glee club?

596
00:24:12,403 --> 00:24:14,571
Because look how distracted
you are by it already.

597
00:24:14,605 --> 00:24:17,374
What if you end up spending
so much time with the glee kids

598
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,376
that you start neglecting
our time together?

599
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,211
I don't want to become
one of those ignored wives

600
00:24:21,245 --> 00:24:22,279
who has an affair.

601
00:24:22,313 --> 00:24:24,915
You are the love of my life.

602
00:24:24,949 --> 00:24:28,385
And nothing is ever gonna
take you away from me.

603
00:24:32,557 --> 00:24:34,157
Good.

604
00:24:35,455 --> 00:24:37,589
Mr. Schuester, how's the search for
our male lead going?

605
00:24:37,623 --> 00:24:40,392
I took the initiative of making
a list of potential candidates

606
00:24:40,426 --> 00:24:41,893
- based on their yearbook photos.
- Um, thanks, Rachel.

607
00:24:41,928 --> 00:24:43,762
But I was actually headed
to the locker room

608
00:24:43,796 --> 00:24:46,098
- to see if, uh, any of the football
players signed up. - Great.

609
00:24:46,132 --> 00:24:47,532
I also made a list
of all the reasons

610
00:24:47,567 --> 00:24:49,034
why I should be getting
the first solo.

611
00:24:49,068 --> 00:24:50,402
I think it would make
an important statement

612
00:24:50,436 --> 00:24:51,937
to the rest of the team
if you told them

613
00:24:51,971 --> 00:24:54,451
right at the beginning
that I'm the star.

614
00:24:55,241 --> 00:24:57,709
Oh, my God.

615
00:24:57,744 --> 00:24:59,077
A-Are you okay?

616
00:24:59,112 --> 00:25:01,213
(laughter)

617
00:25:01,247 --> 00:25:03,215
I told you.

618
00:25:03,249 --> 00:25:05,417
Everyone hates me.

619
00:25:05,451 --> 00:25:07,219
(school bell ringing)

620
00:25:07,253 --> 00:25:08,820
Everybody up!

621
00:25:08,855 --> 00:25:10,622
We're moving to the auditorium.

622
00:25:10,657 --> 00:25:11,990
Alcoholics Anonymous
has the auditorium.

623
00:25:12,025 --> 00:25:13,291
Not anymore.

624
00:25:13,326 --> 00:25:15,060
Principal Figgins
believes in us so much,

625
00:25:15,094 --> 00:25:16,294
he's giving it to us.

626
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:18,096
For a while.

627
00:25:18,131 --> 00:25:20,966
Let's go. And grab a copy of
"You're the One That I Want."

628
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,467
Hold up, who gets
to sing the Sandy part?

629
00:25:22,502 --> 00:25:24,036
Rachel.

630
00:25:25,104 --> 00:25:26,672
Are you serious?

631
00:25:26,706 --> 00:25:29,107
I can blow the roof
off that auditorium.

632
00:25:29,142 --> 00:25:30,742
Her little bitty Jewish voice
won't make it

633
00:25:30,777 --> 00:25:32,511
- past the third row.
- Racist!

634
00:25:32,545 --> 00:25:34,946
And untrue. I can belt just
as good as you, better even.

635
00:25:34,981 --> 00:25:36,948
Oh, really?
Well, let's prove it.

636
00:25:36,983 --> 00:25:39,484
Let's have a sing-off
right here, right now.

637
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:41,253
We're not having a sing-off!

638
00:25:41,287 --> 00:25:43,255
Although that's not a bad idea
for a future exercise.

639
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:45,357
Rachel has this solo.

640
00:25:45,391 --> 00:25:46,658
Like I said,
you'll all take turns.

641
00:25:46,693 --> 00:25:48,627
Except the white girl
goes first.

642
00:25:48,661 --> 00:25:50,696
The white girl
always goes first.

643
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,164
(sobbing softly)

644
00:25:58,204 --> 00:26:00,205
Hey.

645
00:26:03,343 --> 00:26:05,344
I didn't get the solo.

646
00:26:07,347 --> 00:26:11,717
I lost it to that demented
little Beanie Baby.

647
00:26:11,751 --> 00:26:15,187
Mr. Schuester is never
gonna give me a solo.

648
00:26:15,221 --> 00:26:17,389
It's a waste of time;
I'm gonna quit.

649
00:26:17,423 --> 00:26:20,726
Nobody in there is gonna see me
the way that I see myself.

650
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,728
Mercedes.

651
00:26:22,762 --> 00:26:24,029
You are so young.

652
00:26:24,063 --> 00:26:26,331
Glee Club just started.

653
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:28,467
Who knows
what your future holds?

654
00:26:28,501 --> 00:26:30,969
Mercedes,

655
00:26:31,004 --> 00:26:34,206
you are a star.

656
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,208
But part of the responsibility

657
00:26:36,242 --> 00:26:38,176
that goes along
with being a star

658
00:26:38,211 --> 00:26:41,246
is learning to share
the spotlight.

659
00:26:41,281 --> 00:26:45,150
Maybe she's gonna get the solos

660
00:26:45,184 --> 00:26:47,486
because she needs it more
than you do right now.

661
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,189
Truth is, Mercedes, Rachel
will make you better.

662
00:26:51,224 --> 00:26:53,425
Her drive and ambition

663
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:56,261
will help you raise
your expectations of yourself,

664
00:26:56,296 --> 00:26:58,730
and you can use that
to become great.

665
00:26:58,765 --> 00:27:00,732
And I have a feeling

666
00:27:00,767 --> 00:27:02,868
you two are gonna
become great friends.

667
00:27:02,902 --> 00:27:04,202
(scoffs)

668
00:27:04,237 --> 00:27:05,937
(sniffles)

669
00:27:05,972 --> 00:27:08,440
Stars have a way
of finding each other.

670
00:27:08,474 --> 00:27:10,309
Okay, come here.

671
00:27:12,312 --> 00:27:14,279
(school bell ringing)

672
00:27:14,314 --> 00:27:15,547
There you go, Sue.

673
00:27:15,581 --> 00:27:16,949
Some principals would say

674
00:27:16,983 --> 00:27:20,052
that importing a rare silk
trampoline mat

675
00:27:20,086 --> 00:27:23,622
from China is an extravagance,
but not this principal.

676
00:27:23,656 --> 00:27:26,858
The Cheerios! Are McKinley
High's number one priority.

677
00:27:26,893 --> 00:27:29,094
Oh, thank you so much,
Principal Figgins.

678
00:27:29,128 --> 00:27:30,762
I could have never
led my Cheerios!

679
00:27:30,797 --> 00:27:34,399
To a record five consecutive
national championships

680
00:27:34,434 --> 00:27:36,301
without you.
(chuckles)

681
00:27:36,336 --> 00:27:38,303
Actually, I could have done it
very easily without you.

682
00:27:38,338 --> 00:27:40,619
Oh, uh, and that reminds me.
I have a question for you.

683
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,040
Hmm?

684
00:27:42,075 --> 00:27:43,909
What exactly is going on
with Will Schuester

685
00:27:43,943 --> 00:27:45,377
taking over the show choir?

686
00:27:45,411 --> 00:27:47,212
The Glee Club?

687
00:27:47,246 --> 00:27:49,915
Why, Sue, that's nothing
but a trifling.

688
00:27:49,949 --> 00:27:51,917
Well, I just want to be clear
that the star performers

689
00:27:51,951 --> 00:27:53,919
at this high school
are my Cheerios!,

690
00:27:53,953 --> 00:27:55,821
and I should hope
it remains that way.

691
00:27:55,855 --> 00:27:57,456
Oh, Sue, don't worry.

692
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:00,926
You are my star.
You are on Fox Sports Net.

693
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,894
- Yes. - And besides, show
choir won't last.

694
00:28:02,929 --> 00:28:06,598
Will only has five students,
one of them a cripple.

695
00:28:06,633 --> 00:28:08,767
And children these days
aren't interested

696
00:28:08,801 --> 00:28:11,136
in singing to each other.

697
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:14,239
They're too busy with
their Friendster and Myspace

698
00:28:14,274 --> 00:28:15,741
and Blockbuster Video.

699
00:28:15,775 --> 00:28:17,676
These are things
that are here to stay.

700
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,411
Well, I don't know.

701
00:28:19,445 --> 00:28:23,248
I have a bad feeling
about this Glee Club.

702
00:28:23,283 --> 00:28:25,550
(school bell ringing)

703
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,621
(cheering)

704
00:28:31,624 --> 00:28:33,125
Come on, go!

705
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:34,593
Okay, come on.

706
00:28:34,627 --> 00:28:36,495
Traveling.

707
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:38,931
Hey!

708
00:28:38,965 --> 00:28:40,933
Hey, you know, because
we're best friends,

709
00:28:40,967 --> 00:28:43,001
I want to ask you something frankly.
Sure.

710
00:28:43,036 --> 00:28:44,436
Wait, I-I'm your
best friend?

711
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,638
I-I know nothing about you.
We hardly even talk.

712
00:28:46,673 --> 00:28:48,440
We just play basketball
once a week.

713
00:28:48,474 --> 00:28:50,208
Yeah, like I said, best friends.

714
00:28:50,243 --> 00:28:51,443
(sighs)

715
00:28:51,477 --> 00:28:53,278
What are your...
Thank you.

716
00:28:53,313 --> 00:28:55,280
What are your intentions
with this Glee Club?

717
00:28:55,315 --> 00:28:56,481
Intentions?
I don't know.

718
00:28:56,516 --> 00:28:58,150
I guess we'll have to find out.

719
00:28:58,184 --> 00:28:59,551
I don't know, I just...

720
00:28:59,586 --> 00:29:01,553
I look around this school,
I see all these kids

721
00:29:01,588 --> 00:29:02,988
who don't have the arts
in their lives,

722
00:29:03,022 --> 00:29:04,990
and I want them
to have what I had...

723
00:29:05,024 --> 00:29:07,392
A place where they can go
to experience the joy of music.

724
00:29:07,427 --> 00:29:09,161
Yeah, well, they already
have that, William.

725
00:29:09,195 --> 00:29:11,396
It's called the iPod.
I don't know, being a part

726
00:29:11,431 --> 00:29:13,465
of Glee Club was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

727
00:29:13,499 --> 00:29:15,400
Now you're a high school
Spanish teacher.

728
00:29:15,435 --> 00:29:16,668
(laughs)

729
00:29:16,703 --> 00:29:18,470
Will, the students
at this school

730
00:29:18,504 --> 00:29:19,905
aren't going to
become performers.

731
00:29:19,939 --> 00:29:21,240
They're not gonna become
professional singers

732
00:29:21,274 --> 00:29:22,708
or dancers or actors.

733
00:29:22,742 --> 00:29:24,643
They'll be fry cooks
and auto mechanics.

734
00:29:24,677 --> 00:29:27,479
And it's really unfair of you
to suggest anything otherwise.

735
00:29:27,513 --> 00:29:31,250
Fostering unrealistic dreams
in these kids will accomplish

736
00:29:31,284 --> 00:29:33,018
absolutely nothing
but to make their lives

737
00:29:33,052 --> 00:29:36,321
that much more dark
and depressing.

738
00:29:36,356 --> 00:29:39,191
I'm sorry, Sue.
I just disagree.

739
00:29:39,225 --> 00:29:41,159
I mean, the arts are important.

740
00:29:41,194 --> 00:29:43,495
Certainly more important
than cheerleading.

741
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:44,897
(quietly):
How dare you.

742
00:29:44,931 --> 00:29:46,565
And I think,
with a little hard work,

743
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:48,700
this Glee Club could
really accomplish something.

744
00:29:48,735 --> 00:29:50,736
I got Finn Hudson to sign up,

745
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:53,005
and he's the captain
of the football team, so...

746
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,706
who knows
what our future could hold?

747
00:29:54,741 --> 00:29:57,376
I'm gonna give you an
ultimatum, William.

748
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:58,911
You either drop this Glee Club,

749
00:29:58,945 --> 00:30:01,213
or you and I will cease
to be friends.

750
00:30:01,247 --> 00:30:02,807
(chuckles):
What?

751
00:30:04,317 --> 00:30:05,717
Are you serious?

752
00:30:05,752 --> 00:30:07,185
You do not want to make

753
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,588
an enemy out of Sue Sylvester.

754
00:30:09,622 --> 00:30:11,456
You don't want to do that.

755
00:30:18,164 --> 00:30:19,965
Sorry, Sue.

756
00:30:20,567 --> 00:30:22,634
No deal.

00:31:40,236 --> 00:31:43,304
I am very aware that it is the
job off the assistant manager

788
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:46,541
to stock the novelty sheets,
Howard, but I am pregnant,

789
00:31:46,575 --> 00:31:49,043
and my doctor says I
need to take it easy.

790
00:31:49,078 --> 00:31:51,045
- Are you on bed rest?
- Oh, not officially,

791
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,547
but I'm sure I will
be soon enough.

792
00:31:52,581 --> 00:31:54,341
And even sooner,
if you keep stressing me out

793
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,310
by complaining that you can't
do my job right now.

(sighs)

797
00:32:03,225 --> 00:32:05,059
Mrs. Schuester,
I'm Rachel Berry.

798
00:32:05,094 --> 00:32:06,461
I'm one of
your husband's students,

799
00:32:06,495 --> 00:32:07,695
Glee Club specifically.

800
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:10,465
- I'm working.
- First of all,

801
00:32:10,499 --> 00:32:12,233
I just wanted to congratulate
you on your new addition.

802
00:32:12,268 --> 00:32:14,035
I can tell that you already
have the pregnancy glow.

803
00:32:14,069 --> 00:32:15,904
Oh. Thank you.

804
00:32:15,938 --> 00:32:17,806
Second of all, I just wanted to
ask you to reconsider guilting

805
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,542
your husband into quitting his
job and becoming an accountant.

806
00:32:20,576 --> 00:32:23,311
Here's what I've learned in the
years since I left high school.

807
00:32:23,345 --> 00:32:25,413
There's who you are, and
there's who you think you are.

808
00:32:25,448 --> 00:32:27,715
And your level of
personal misery is determined

809
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,851
by how big the gap is
between them.

810
00:32:29,885 --> 00:32:33,488
It's my job as a wife to help
my husband see who he really is,

811
00:32:33,522 --> 00:32:36,257
rather than going after
who he thinks he ought to be.

812
00:32:36,292 --> 00:32:38,226
That's how I keep him happy.

813
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,829
But isn't the point of life to
imagine yourself doing something

814
00:32:40,863 --> 00:32:43,331
greater, then working hard
to achieve all of your dreams?

815
00:32:43,365 --> 00:32:45,100
Yes, if it's realistic.

816
00:32:45,134 --> 00:32:47,936
See, I want a bigger house,
and I want to decorate it

817
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,370
with the entire catalog
from Pottery Barn,

818
00:32:49,405 --> 00:32:51,239
and I can have those things.

819
00:32:51,273 --> 00:32:54,509
But not if I'm gonna let Will
ruin it by chasing after a dream

820
00:32:54,543 --> 00:32:56,511
that doesn't change our lives
in any measurable way.

821
00:32:56,545 --> 00:32:58,379
Oh, but he would be helping...
Mainly me...

822
00:32:58,414 --> 00:32:59,948
To achieve my full potential.

823
00:32:59,982 --> 00:33:01,616
That's not gonna help
Mama buy personalized.

824
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,952
Mr. and Mrs. throw pillows
from the monogram shop.

825
00:33:03,986 --> 00:33:07,922
Do not put the plush blankets
with the novelty sheets!

826
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,229
You're stressing out my baby.

827
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:17,766
Mrs. Schuester,

828
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,300
I am begging you to reconsider.

829
00:33:19,335 --> 00:33:20,935
Mr. Schuester listens to you.

830
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,604
Yes, because he's my husband.

831
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:25,940
And it is my job to bring
structure to our family,

832
00:33:25,975 --> 00:33:28,810
and his job to do as I say.

833
00:33:31,514 --> 00:33:34,949
I always wanted to be in
an all-male a Capella group.

834
00:33:35,985 --> 00:33:38,420
I guess my dream is dead, too.

835
00:33:42,691 --> 00:33:45,093
First the almighty Finn
Hudson joins Glee Club,

836
00:33:45,127 --> 00:33:47,562
and everyone rejoices
like he's baby Jesus.

837
00:33:47,596 --> 00:33:49,230
Then he quits, then he rejoins,

838
00:33:49,265 --> 00:33:51,266
then he immediately
starts bossing us around

839
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,860
like we're his slaves, and we're
supposed to be happy about that?

840
00:33:53,869 --> 00:33:55,437
We need him though, Kurt.

841
00:33:55,471 --> 00:33:57,238
Why? Because
he's popular?

842
00:33:57,273 --> 00:33:58,907
No, he's not only popular.

843
00:33:58,941 --> 00:34:01,443
He's at the top of the damn
McKinley High food chain.

844
00:34:01,477 --> 00:34:03,912
But I don't know...
Maybe he needs us, too.

845
00:34:03,946 --> 00:34:05,814
Oh, yeah, sure. The guy
with the perfect life

846
00:34:05,848 --> 00:34:07,649
needs to hang out with
the damaged goods.

847
00:34:07,683 --> 00:34:08,817
Who you calling "damaged goods"?

848
00:34:08,851 --> 00:34:10,418
No one!

849
00:34:10,453 --> 00:34:12,287
I'm just saying that
I don't trust him.

850
00:34:12,321 --> 00:34:14,856
I mean, he already gets
everything that he wants.

851
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:17,592
What is he doing barging into
our club and taking it over?

852
00:34:17,626 --> 00:34:19,928
Mark my words, he's gonna get

853
00:34:19,962 --> 00:34:21,602
some jocks and some
Cheerios! To join him,

854
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,665
and then we are
gonna get pushed out.

855
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:24,866
Oh, no.

856
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,134
Nobody pushes out
Mercedes Jones.

857
00:34:26,168 --> 00:34:28,369
Or Kurt Hummel.
I will not allow it.

858
00:34:28,404 --> 00:34:30,105
No, sir.

859
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:32,874
You know, now that
I think about it,

860
00:34:32,908 --> 00:34:34,943
he was pretty bossy today.

861
00:34:34,977 --> 00:34:37,479
I cannot believe he convinced
me to make our costumes.

862
00:34:37,513 --> 00:34:39,447
Oh, by the way,
if you need help with that,

863
00:34:39,482 --> 00:34:40,949
I'm more than happy to pitch in.

864
00:34:40,983 --> 00:34:42,650
You can't go wrong
with red and denim.

865
00:34:42,685 --> 00:34:45,165
How did you become so
smart and adorable?

866
00:34:46,355 --> 00:34:48,490
(both laugh)

867
00:34:48,524 --> 00:34:50,458
Oh.

868
00:34:50,493 --> 00:34:52,193
Baby, can you hand
me some sugar?

869
00:34:52,228 --> 00:34:53,628
Oh.

870
00:34:53,662 --> 00:34:55,163
Sure.

871
00:34:55,197 --> 00:34:56,831
Thanks!

872
00:34:56,866 --> 00:34:58,533
You're the only openly
gay person I know.

873
00:34:58,567 --> 00:34:59,734
That is so brave of you.

874
00:34:59,769 --> 00:35:01,403
Well, coming out was

875
00:35:01,437 --> 00:35:02,737
the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

876
00:35:02,772 --> 00:35:04,639
But I'm telling you
it feels so nice

877
00:35:04,673 --> 00:35:06,541
to not be living a lie anymore.

878
00:35:06,575 --> 00:35:08,143
So what about you, Joby?

879
00:35:08,177 --> 00:35:09,677
Are you thinking about
coming out anytime soon?

880
00:35:09,712 --> 00:35:11,513
What? I-I'm not gay.

881
00:35:11,547 --> 00:35:12,881
I'm straight as an arrow.

882
00:35:12,915 --> 00:35:14,315
I'm attracted to women.

883
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,350
Obviously, of course.

884
00:35:15,384 --> 00:35:17,052
Um, I-I had no idea, I...

885
00:35:17,086 --> 00:35:19,254
I mean, it's obvious
that Rachel's only

886
00:35:19,288 --> 00:35:21,189
letting him stay in the club
because she has

887
00:35:21,223 --> 00:35:22,757
a fat crush on him.

888
00:35:22,792 --> 00:35:23,992
KURT:
<i>So do you. No, I don't.</i>

889
00:35:24,026 --> 00:35:25,860
<i>Oh, get real, you do, too.</i>

890
00:35:25,895 --> 00:35:27,328
Yeah, maybe you're right.

891
00:35:27,363 --> 00:35:30,231
Maybe having Finn Hudson around
is a mistake.

892
00:35:30,266 --> 00:35:32,701
I'm gonna call
an emergency meeting.

893
00:35:38,518 --> 00:35:40,519
And another thing... he wants us
to do "Don't Stop Believin'."

894
00:35:40,553 --> 00:35:41,787
Our audience is
gonna think we're doing

895
00:35:41,821 --> 00:35:43,255
a salute to<i> The Sopranos</i> finale.

896
00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:46,024
- You guys started without me?
- Uh, hell yeah, Berry.

897
00:35:46,059 --> 00:35:47,593
- You're, like, ten minutes late.
- You're lucky that I came

898
00:35:47,627 --> 00:35:49,461
at all and I don't think
that we should be having

899
00:35:49,496 --> 00:35:51,663
emergency meetings without all
of our members, including Finn.

900
00:35:51,698 --> 00:35:53,298
That's what this is about.

901
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:55,267
Okay, we're having
second thoughts about him.

902
00:35:55,301 --> 00:35:56,802
For the record,
not all of us are.

903
00:35:56,836 --> 00:35:58,337
Okay, we can't kick him out.

904
00:35:58,371 --> 00:36:00,272
I just personally
persuaded him to come back.

905
00:36:00,306 --> 00:36:02,508
Them personally
persuade him to quit.

906
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:05,144
It shouldn't be that difficult.
He's already quit once before.

907
00:36:05,178 --> 00:36:06,678
Look, it's obvious that Artie

908
00:36:06,713 --> 00:36:09,782
and I don't fit your idea
of a proper leading man.

909
00:36:09,816 --> 00:36:12,618
And honestly I don't care, but
he shouldn't be an evil jock.

910
00:36:12,652 --> 00:36:14,319
I don't think
that Finn Hudson is evil.

911
00:36:14,354 --> 00:36:16,155
Now, his girlfriend,
Quinn Fabray?

912
00:36:16,189 --> 00:36:17,189
She's a grade-A bitch.

913
00:36:17,223 --> 00:36:19,024
Hey, all I know

914
00:36:19,059 --> 00:36:21,894
is that when the jocks locked
me in that nasty Porta-Potty,

915
00:36:21,928 --> 00:36:23,996
Finn Hudson rescued me.

916
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:26,298
Then, after rehearsal,
he wheeled me home.

917
00:36:26,332 --> 00:36:29,301
<i>He wheeled me all the way home,</i>

918
00:36:29,335 --> 00:36:30,903
<i>and he told my mom what happened</i>

919
00:36:30,937 --> 00:36:32,638
<i>and he apologized to her.</i>

920
00:36:32,672 --> 00:36:34,540
So, he's not evil.

921
00:36:34,574 --> 00:36:37,242
Not by a long shot.
He's never called me fat.

922
00:36:37,277 --> 00:36:39,378
I mean, that's better than most
of the jerks at this school.

923
00:36:39,412 --> 00:36:41,513
I guess when I got tossed
into the Dumpster,

924
00:36:41,548 --> 00:36:43,549
he let me take off
my Marc Jacobs jacket.

925
00:36:43,583 --> 00:36:45,250
That was kind of nice.

926
00:36:45,285 --> 00:36:47,986
He is awfully c-cute.

927
00:36:48,021 --> 00:36:51,356
Maybe he's not
that different than us.

928
00:36:51,391 --> 00:36:52,658
Maybe he just

929
00:36:52,692 --> 00:36:54,493
wants to be accepted
for who he is

930
00:36:54,527 --> 00:36:56,528
and not for
what people label him as.

931
00:36:56,563 --> 00:36:58,530
And if we start
excluding people,

932
00:36:58,565 --> 00:37:01,133
then we're no different
than the people who exclude us.

933
00:37:03,236 --> 00:37:06,872
So far, my time
at McKinley has sucked.

934
00:37:06,906 --> 00:37:09,808
But... not this week.

935
00:37:11,811 --> 00:37:14,079
I made some friends.

936
00:37:14,114 --> 00:37:16,715
And that's always been
really hard for me.

937
00:37:18,418 --> 00:37:21,520
I don't know what's gonna happen
with this club,

938
00:37:21,554 --> 00:37:23,522
but...

939
00:37:23,556 --> 00:37:25,858
maybe it'll be
something special.

940
00:37:25,892 --> 00:37:27,693
Maybe it'll be

941
00:37:27,727 --> 00:37:30,596
somewhere safe where we can...

942
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:33,432
learn from each other
and be who we are,

943
00:37:33,466 --> 00:37:36,301
including people
who are different than us.

944
00:37:36,336 --> 00:37:39,204
When we look back
on our time here,

945
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:41,040
we should be proud.

946
00:37:41,074 --> 00:37:45,244
For what we did
and-and who we included.

947
00:37:47,514 --> 00:37:49,982
All in favor of keeping Finn
in the Glee Club?

948
00:37:50,984 --> 00:37:52,051
Aye.

949
00:37:52,085 --> 00:37:52,818
Aye.

950
00:37:52,852 --> 00:37:53,852
Aye.

951
00:37:55,522 --> 00:37:57,956
Aye.

952
00:37:59,693 --> 00:38:02,628
Aye.

953
00:38:02,662 --> 00:38:04,329
For the last time,
my hands are tied.

954
00:38:04,364 --> 00:38:06,665
I can't offer Will Schuester
a raise to run a club

955
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,568
that no one cares about
and has only six members!

956
00:38:09,602 --> 00:38:11,303
Fine, then we're gonna lose Will
Schuester, and it's gonna be

957
00:38:11,337 --> 00:38:12,971
under your leadership
that McKinley High becomes

958
00:38:13,006 --> 00:38:14,773
the most recent in a very long
line of public schools

959
00:38:14,808 --> 00:38:17,609
that offer no performing arts
whatsoever!

960
00:38:17,644 --> 00:38:20,012
And that's a fact
that wounds me deeply,

961
00:38:20,046 --> 00:38:23,182
neurotic, adorable Guidance
Counselor Emma Pillsbury.

962
00:38:23,216 --> 00:38:26,318
I can't offer Will
Schuester more money,

963
00:38:26,353 --> 00:38:28,887
but I can offer him
something better.

964
00:38:29,956 --> 00:38:33,993
A precious adolescent memory.

965
00:38:34,027 --> 00:38:35,694
I scoured McKinley's archives

966
00:38:35,729 --> 00:38:37,463
and found this footage

967
00:38:37,497 --> 00:38:41,867

968
00:38:41,901 --> 00:38:46,805

Congratulations, buddy.

977
00:39:24,444 --> 00:39:26,679
I just heard the great news.

978
00:39:26,713 --> 00:39:28,981
Oh, thanks. Yeah.
Terri and I are really excited.

979

We've been talking
about kids for a while.

980
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:33,385
No, not that news. Knocking
somebody up isn't difficult

981
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,587
and hardly merits
a congratulations.

982
00:39:35,622 --> 00:39:37,556
No, I'm talking about
your other news,

983
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,692
your leaving the profession
of teaching.

984
00:39:39,726 --> 00:39:41,727
Oh, uh... You know, to
be honest with you,

985
00:39:41,761 --> 00:39:43,395
teaching is for losers.

986
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,910
Nope, accounting is the
career for you. Oh, hey,

987
00:39:45,932 --> 00:39:48,534
- I got you a going away present.
- An abacus.

988
00:39:48,568 --> 00:39:51,370
Yeah, the Orientals say it's
easier than a calculator,

989
00:39:51,404 --> 00:39:54,206
which is an obvious lie designed
to make us feel inferior.

990
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,776
Oh, and here's five years
worth of receipts

991

992
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:01,780
