1
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,438
Whoa, there!

2
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:27,804
Halt!

3
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,597
Who goes there?

4
00:04:30,809 --> 00:04:34,643
It is l, Arthur, Son of Uther Pendragon,
from the castle of Camelot.

5
00:04:35,249 --> 00:04:37,968
King of the Britons, defeater of the Saxons.

6
00:04:38,609 --> 00:04:40,679
Sovereign of all England!

7
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:43,482
Pull the other one.

8
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:46,686
l am, and this is my trusty servant, Patsy.

9
00:04:47,049 --> 00:04:50,405
We have ridden the length of the land
in search of knights...

10
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:55,244
...who will join me in my court at Camelot.
l must speak with your lord and master.

11
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,840
-What? Ridden on a horse?
-Yes.

12
00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:00,200
-You're using coconuts!
-What?

13
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:04,163
You've got two empty halves of coconut,
and you're banging them together.

14
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:07,798
So? We have ridden since
the snows of winter covered this land.

15
00:05:08,489 --> 00:05:11,959
-Through the Kingdom of Mercia.
-Where did you get the coconuts?

16
00:05:12,049 --> 00:05:13,164
We found them.

17
00:05:13,249 --> 00:05:16,366
Found them? In Mercia?
The coconut is tropical.

18
00:05:16,769 --> 00:05:19,363
-What do you mean?
-Well, this is a temperate zone.

19
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:22,998
The swallow may fly south with the sun,
or the house martin or the plover...

20
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:27,241
...may seek warmer climes in winter,
yet these are not strangers to our land.

21
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:32,680
-Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
-Not at all. They could be carried.

22
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:37,321
-What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
-It could grip it by the husk.

23
00:05:37,929 --> 00:05:42,605
it痴 not a question of where he grips it.
it痴 a simple question of weight ratio.

24
00:05:43,049 --> 00:05:47,042
A 5-ounce bird could not carry
a 1-pound coconut.

25
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:51,839
It doesn't matter. Go tell your master
that Arthur from Camelot is here.

26
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:56,281
In order to maintain air-speed velocity...

27
00:05:56,529 --> 00:06:00,761
...a swallow needs to beat its wings
43 times every second, right?

28
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:02,920
-Please!
-Am l right?

29
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:07,682
-I知 not interested.
-It could be carried by an African swallow.

30
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:12,880
Oh, yes! An African swallow, maybe.
Not a European swallow. That's my point.

31
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:14,197
l agree with that.

32
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:18,202
Will you ask your master
if he wants to join my court at Camelot?

33
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:22,287
But then, of course,
African swallows are non-migratory.

34
00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:25,441
-Oh, yes.
-They couldn't bring a coconut, anyway.

35
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:29,525
Wait a minute! Supposing two swallows
carried it together?

36
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:34,400
-No, they'd have to have it on a line.
-Simple. They'd use a strand of creeper.

37
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:37,961
-Held under the dorsal guiding feathers?
-Why not?

38
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:41,608
Bring out your dead!

39
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:13,244
Ninepence.

40
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:34,319
-Bring out your dead.
-Here's one.

41
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:35,559
Ninepence.

42
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:37,207
-I知 not dead!
-What?

43
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:39,849
-Nothing. There's your ninepence.
-I知 not dead!

44
00:07:39,929 --> 00:07:42,079
-He says he's not dead.
-Yes, he is.

45
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:43,602
-I知 not!
-He isn't.

46
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:46,157
-He will be soon. He's very ill.
-I知 getting better!

47
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:47,921
You'll be stone dead in a moment.

48
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,569
l can't take him like that.
it痴 against regulations.

49
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:53,846
-l don't want to go on the cart.
-Don't be such a baby.

50
00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:55,999
-l can't take him.
-l feel fine.

51
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:58,045
-Well, do us a favour.
-l can't.

52
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:00,643
Can you hang around a few minutes?
He won't be long.

53
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:03,323
Got to go to the Robinsons'.
They've lost nine today.

54
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:05,127
-When's your next round?
-Thursday.

55
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:08,804
-l think I値l go for a walk.
-You're not fooling anyone, you know.

56
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:13,724
-Isn't there something you can do?
-l feel happy.

57
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:17,802
-Thanks very much.
-Not at all. See you on Thursday.

58
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:18,924
Right.

59
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:25,527
-Who's that, then?
-l don't know. Must be a king.

60
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:28,277
-Why?
-He hasn't got shit all over him.

61
00:08:51,169 --> 00:08:52,522
-Old woman!
-Man!

62
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:56,445
Man. Sorry.
What knight lives in that castle over there?

63
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,480
-I知 37.
-What?

64
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:02,684
-I知 37. I知 not old.
-l can't just call you ''man.''

65
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:05,647
-You could say, ''Dennis.''
-l didn't know you were a Dennis.

66
00:09:05,729 --> 00:09:07,321
You didn't bother to find out.

67
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:10,048
l did say sorry about the ''old woman,''
but from behind--

68
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:13,280
What l object to
is that you treat me like an inferior.

69
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:16,122
-Well, l am king.
-King? Very nice.

70
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,408
How did you get that?
By exploiting the workers!

71
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:23,085
By hanging on to outdated
imperialist dogma which perpetuates...

72
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:26,047
...the economic and social differences
in our society!

73
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:30,441
-lf there's ever going to be any progress--
-There's some lovely filth down here.

74
00:09:31,449 --> 00:09:32,598
How do you do?

75
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:35,567
How do you do, good lady?
l am Arthur, King of the Britons.

76
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:37,958
-Whose castle is that?
-King of the who?

77
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:40,159
-The Britons.
-Who are the Britons?

78
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:43,247
We all are. We're all Britons.
And l am your king.

79
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:47,001
Didn't know we had a king.
We're an autonomous collective.

80
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:49,842
You're fooling yourself.
We're living in a dictatorship.

81
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:52,887
A self-perpetuating autocracy
in which the working class--

82
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:55,324
There you go. Bringing class into it again.

83
00:09:55,409 --> 00:09:59,721
-That's what it's all about. lf only people--
-Please, good people. l am in haste.

84
00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:01,602
Who lives in that castle?

85
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:04,485
-No one lives there.
-Who is your lord?

86
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:06,366
-We don't have a lord.
-What?

87
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:09,327
l told you.
We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune.

88
00:10:09,729 --> 00:10:13,039
We take turns to act as
a sort of executive officer for the week.

89
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:15,563
-Yes.
-But all the decisions of that officer...

90
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:18,561
-...are ratified at a biweekly meeting.
-Yes, l see.

91
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:21,800
-By majority in the case of internal affairs.
-Be quiet!

92
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:26,121
-By a two-thirds majority in the case of--
-Be quiet! l order you to be quiet.

93
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:28,520
''Order.'' Who does he think he is?

94
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:31,117
-l am your king!
-l didn't vote for you.

95
00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:34,566
-You don't vote for kings.
-How did you become king then?

96
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:39,560
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad
in the purest shimmering samite...

97
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:42,921
...held aloft Excalibur
from the bosom of the water...

98
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:48,205
...signifying, by divine providence,
that l, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur.

99
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,168
That is why I知 your king!

100
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:54,561
Listen. Strange women lying in ponds,
distributing swords, is no basis...

101
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:57,800
...for a system of government.
Supreme executive power...

102
00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:02,280
...derives from a mandate from the masses.
Not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

103
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:03,279
Be quiet!

104
00:11:03,369 --> 00:11:06,486
You can't expect to wield
supreme executive power...

105
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:09,037
...'cause some watery tart
threw a sword at you.

106
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:12,246
-Shut up!
-lf l went around saying l was an emperor...

107
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:16,402
...because some moistened bint had lobbed
a scimitar at me, they'd put me away!

108
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:20,448
-Will you shut up?
-See the violence inherent in the system.

109
00:11:20,609 --> 00:11:24,045
-Shut up!
-See the violence inherent in the system!

110
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:27,087
-Help, I知 being repressed!
-Bloody peasant!

111
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:29,478
What a give away. Did you hear that?

112
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:32,242
That's what I知 on about.
Did you see him repressing me?

113
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:08,281
You fight with the strength of many men,
Sir Knight.

114
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:13,399
l am Arthur, King of the Britons.

115
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:21,881
l seek the finest and bravest knights
in the land to join me in Camelot.

116
00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:30,326
You have proved yourself worthy.
Will you join me?

117
00:13:35,729 --> 00:13:38,687
You make me sad. So be it. Come, Patsy.

118
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:40,601
None shall pass.

119
00:13:40,969 --> 00:13:42,960
-What?
-None shall pass.

120
00:13:43,609 --> 00:13:47,204
l have no quarrel with you, good
Sir Knight, but l must cross this bridge.

121
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:49,405
Then you shall die.

122
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:54,037
l command you, as King of the Britons,
to stand aside.

123
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:57,765
l move for no man.

124
00:13:59,489 --> 00:14:00,638
So be it!

125
00:14:26,289 --> 00:14:28,280
Now, stand aside, worthy adversary.

126
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:31,441
-'Tis but a scratch.
-''A scratch''? Your arm's off.

127
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:33,844
-No, it isn't.
-Well, what's that, then?

128
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:36,288
-I致e had worse.
-You liar.

129
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:37,927
Come on, you pansy!

130
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:46,968
Victory is mine.

131
00:14:48,729 --> 00:14:50,799
We thank thee, Lord, that in thy--

132
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:53,562
-Come on, then.
-What?

133
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:55,038
Have at you.

134
00:14:56,689 --> 00:14:59,044
You are brave, Sir Knight,
but the fight is mine.

135
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:00,482
Had enough, eh?

136
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:04,083
Look, you stupid bastard.
You've got no arms left.

137
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:05,568
-Yes, l have.
-Look!

138
00:15:05,969 --> 00:15:07,402
Just a flesh wound.

139
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,758
-Look, stop that.
-Chicken!

140
00:15:10,849 --> 00:15:13,044
I値l have your leg. Right!

141
00:15:15,969 --> 00:15:18,244
-Right! I値l do you for that.
-You'll what?

142
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:21,127
-Come here.
-What are you going to do? Bleed on me?

143
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:23,848
-l am invincible!
-You're a loony.

144
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:28,084
The Black Knight always triumphs.
Have at you!

145
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:30,283
Come on, then.

146
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:37,320
All right, we'll call it a draw.

147
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:40,518
-Come, Patsy.
-Oh, l see.

148
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:44,445
Running away? You yellow bastard!

149
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:48,482
Come back here and take what's coming
to you! I値l bite your legs off!

150
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:55,877
''Pie Jesu Domine

151
00:15:56,489 --> 00:16:00,687
''Dona eis requiem

152
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:06,718
''Pie Jesu Domine

153
00:16:08,289 --> 00:16:13,079
''Dona eis requiem''

154
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:26,640
-A witch!
-We found a witch.

155
00:16:28,729 --> 00:16:30,799
-We got a witch.
-We found a witch.

156
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:34,928
We've got a witch.

157
00:16:36,289 --> 00:16:38,200
Burn her!

158
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:50,004
-We have found a witch. May we burn her?
-Burn her!

159
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:54,567
-How do you know she is a witch?
-She looks like one.

160
00:16:56,529 --> 00:16:57,928
Bring her forward.

161
00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:02,921
-l am not a witch.
-But you are dressed as one.

162
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:05,962
-They dressed me up like this.
-We didn't!

163
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:08,085
And this isn't my nose. it痴 a false one.

164
00:17:08,129 --> 00:17:11,769
 

165
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:14,085
-Well?
-Well, we did do the nose.

166
00:17:14,889 --> 00:17:17,642
-The nose?
-And the hat. But she is a witch.

167
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:20,807
Burn her!

168
00:17:21,729 --> 00:17:25,642
-Did you dress her up like this?
-No. Yes.

169
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:29,160
Yes, a bit. She has got a wart.

170
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:34,483
-What makes you think she is a witch?
-Well, she turned me into a newt.

171
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:36,958
A newt?

172
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:42,283
l got better.

173
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:45,089
-Burn her anyway.
-Burn her!

174
00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:53,325
Quiet! There are ways of telling
whether she is a witch.

175
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:57,280
-Are there? What are they? Tell us.
-Do they hurt?

176
00:17:57,729 --> 00:18:00,527
Tell me: What do you do with witches?

177
00:18:00,689 --> 00:18:02,964
Burn them!

178
00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:07,604
-What do you burn apart from witches?
-More witches!

179
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:12,245
-Wood.
-So, why do witches burn?

180
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:25,683
-'Cause they're made of wood?
-Good.

181
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,999
So, how do we tell
whether she is made of wood?

182
00:18:32,089 --> 00:18:36,605
-Build a bridge out of her.
-Can you not also make bridges of stone?

183
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:38,798
Oh, yeah.

184
00:18:39,889 --> 00:18:42,164
Does wood sink in water?

185
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,844
-No.
-It floats.

186
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:46,567
Throw her into the pond!

187
00:18:49,489 --> 00:18:52,447
-What also floats in water?
-Bread.

188
00:18:53,449 --> 00:18:55,246
-Apples.
-Very small rocks.

189
00:18:55,689 --> 00:18:58,249
-Cider. Gravy. Cherries.
-Nuts.

190
00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:00,407
-Churches.
-Lead.

191
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:01,598
A duck!

192
00:19:03,889 --> 00:19:04,878
Exactly.

193
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:08,207
So, logically....

194
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,247
lf she...

195
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:13,284
...weighs the same as a duck...

196
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:17,162
...she's made of wood.

197
00:19:17,249 --> 00:19:18,648
And, therefore....

198
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:22,168
-A witch!
-A witch!

199
00:19:26,689 --> 00:19:28,805
We shall use my largest scales.

200
00:19:48,249 --> 00:19:51,685
Right. Remove the supports!

201
00:19:58,689 --> 00:20:00,407
-it痴 a fair cop.
-Burn her!

202
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:06,849
 

203
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:11,206
Who are you,
who are so wise in the ways of science?

204
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:14,520
-l am Arthur, King of the Britons.
-My liege.

205
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:20,604
Good Sir Knight, will you come to Camelot,
and join us at the Round Table?

206
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:23,160
My liege, l would be honoured.

207
00:20:23,769 --> 00:20:26,237
-What is your name?
-Bedevere, my liege.

208
00:20:26,689 --> 00:20:29,283
Then l dub you, Sir Bedevere...

209
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:31,960
...knight of the Round Table.

210
00:20:33,209 --> 00:20:36,804
The Wise Sir Bedevere Was the first
to join King Arthur's knights.

211
00:20:37,089 --> 00:20:39,842
But other illustrious names
Were soon to follow.

212
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:42,087
Sir Lancelot the Brave.

213
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:44,687
Sir Galahad the Pure.

214
00:20:45,449 --> 00:20:48,327
And Sir Robin,
the Not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Lancelot...

215
00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:50,559
...Who had nearly fought
the Dragon of Angnor...

216
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,607
...Who nearly stood up to
the vicious Chicken of Bristol...

217
00:20:53,689 --> 00:20:57,284
...and Who had personally Wet himself
at the Battle of Badon Hill.

218
00:20:57,529 --> 00:21:00,839
And the aptly named
Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film.

219
00:21:02,209 --> 00:21:03,847
Together they formed a band...

220
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,604
...Whose names and deeds
Were to be retold throughout the centuries.

221
00:21:07,729 --> 00:21:09,959
The Knights of the Round Table.

222
00:21:10,689 --> 00:21:13,965
That, my liege, is how we know
the Earth to be banana-shaped.

223
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:16,404
This new learning amazes me,
Sir Bedevere.

224
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:20,164
Explain again how sheep's bladders
may be employed to prevent earthquakes.

225
00:21:20,249 --> 00:21:21,967
-Certainly, sir.
-Look, my liege.

226
00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:25,569
 

227
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:27,801
-Camelot.
-Camelot.

228
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:29,920
-Camelot.
-it痴 only a model.

229
00:21:31,609 --> 00:21:34,123
Knights, l bid you welcome
to your new home.

230
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:36,763
Let us ride to Camelot!

231
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:41,680
''We're knights of the Round Table
We dance whene'er we're able

232
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:44,727
''We do routines and chorus scenes
With footwork impeccable

233
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:47,767
''We dine well here in Camelot
We eat ham and jam and Spam a lot

234
00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:58,522
''We're knights of the Round Table
Our shows are formidable

235
00:21:59,209 --> 00:22:00,927
''But many times
We're given rhymes

236
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:03,762
''That are quite unsingable
We're opera mad in Camelot

237
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:05,919
''We sing from the diaphragm a lot

238
00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:24,449
''In war we're tough and able

239
00:22:24,689 --> 00:22:26,042
''Quite indefatigable

240
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:28,206
''Between our quests
We sequin vests

241
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:31,361
''And impersonate Clark Gable
it痴 a busy life in Camelot

242
00:22:31,729 --> 00:22:35,608
''l have to push the pram a lot''

243
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:43,645
No, on second thoughts,
let's not go to Camelot. It is a silly place.

244
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:44,923
Right.

245
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:56,920
Arthur.

246
00:22:57,369 --> 00:22:58,768
King of the Britons.

247
00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:04,124
Don't grovel. If there's one thing
I can稚 stand, it's people grovelling.

248
00:23:04,209 --> 00:23:05,847
-Sorry.
-And don't apologize.

249
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:09,725
Every time I talk to someone it's
''sorry this,'' and, ''forgive me that''...

250
00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:11,367
...and, ''I'm not Worthy.''

251
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:14,123
-What are you doing now?
-I知 averting my eyes, O Lord.

252
00:23:14,209 --> 00:23:18,566
Don't. It's like those miserable psalms.
They're so depressing.

253
00:23:18,769 --> 00:23:20,441
-Now, knock it off!
-Yes, Lord.

254
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:23,885
Right. Arthur, King of the Britons.

255
00:23:24,449 --> 00:23:26,963
Your knights of the Round Table
shall have a task...

256
00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:29,643
...to make them an example
in these dark times.

257
00:23:29,729 --> 00:23:32,323
-Good idea, O Lord!
-'Course it's a good idea.

258
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:36,558
Behold, Arthur, this is the Holy Grail.

259
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:41,246
Look Well, Arthur,
for it is your sacred task to seek this grail.

260
00:23:41,649 --> 00:23:43,799
That is your purpose, Arthur.

261
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:47,328
The quest for the Holy Grail.

262
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:54,639
-A blessing from the Lord.
-God be praised!

263
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:12,209
 

264
00:24:51,209 --> 00:24:52,244
Halt!

265
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:03,804
Hello!

266
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:12,158
Hello!

267
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:15,288
Hello. Who is it?

268
00:25:15,609 --> 00:25:19,045
It is King Arthur, and these are
my knights of the Round Table.

269
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:20,682
Whose castle is this?

270
00:25:20,889 --> 00:25:24,040
This is the castle of my master,
Guy de Loimbard.

271
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:27,878
Go and tell your master
that we have been charged by God...

272
00:25:28,449 --> 00:25:32,727
...with a sacred quest. lf he will give us
food and shelter for the night...

273
00:25:33,129 --> 00:25:35,882
...he can join us in our quest
for the Holy Grail.

274
00:25:36,209 --> 00:25:39,246
Well, I値l ask him,
but l don't think he'll be very keen.

275
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,320
He's already got one, you see.

276
00:25:42,449 --> 00:25:44,804
-What?
-He says they've already got one!

277
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:49,764
-Are you sure he's got one?
-Oh, yes. it痴 very nice.

278
00:25:50,609 --> 00:25:52,679
l told him we've already got one.

279
00:25:55,729 --> 00:25:59,847
-Can we come up, and have a look?
-Of course not! You are English-types.

280
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:03,604
-Well, what are you then?
-I知 French.

281
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:07,477
Why do you think l have
this outrageous accent, you silly king?

282
00:26:07,969 --> 00:26:11,041
-What are you doing in England?
-Mind your own business.

283
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:16,238
lf you will not show us the Grail,
we shall take your castle by force.

284
00:26:16,329 --> 00:26:19,366
You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs!

285
00:26:19,929 --> 00:26:23,717
Go and boil your bottoms,
sons of a silly person.

286
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:27,718
l blow my nose at you,
so-called Arthur King.

287
00:26:27,929 --> 00:26:31,842
You and all your silly English knights.

288
00:26:38,449 --> 00:26:41,680
-What a strange person.
-Now look here, my good man--

289
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:44,044
l don't want to talk to you no more...

290
00:26:44,329 --> 00:26:47,446
...you empty-headed,
animal food-trough wiper.

291
00:26:47,849 --> 00:26:50,443
l fart in your general direction.

292
00:26:50,929 --> 00:26:55,605
Your mother was a hamster,
and your father smelt of elderberries.

293
00:26:57,769 --> 00:27:00,329
Is there someone else up there
we could talk to?

294
00:27:00,409 --> 00:27:04,163
No. Now go away,
or l shall taunt you a second time.

295
00:27:06,449 --> 00:27:09,964
Now, this is your last chance.
I致e been more than reasonable....

296
00:27:10,089 --> 00:27:11,442
-Fetchez la vache!
-Quoi?

297
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:12,325
Fetchez la vache!

298
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:14,969
 

299
00:27:15,209 --> 00:27:18,167
lf you do not agree to my commands,
then l shall--

300
00:27:19,969 --> 00:27:21,197
Jesus Christ!

301
00:27:21,409 --> 00:27:24,289
 

302
00:27:26,089 --> 00:27:28,284
Right! Charge!

303
00:27:35,249 --> 00:27:39,649
 

304
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:44,797
Run away! Run away!

305
00:27:54,929 --> 00:27:57,124
-Fiends! I値l tear them apart.
-No, no.

306
00:27:57,209 --> 00:28:00,042
Sir, l have a plan, sir.

307
00:29:05,089 --> 00:29:09,889
 

308
00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:32,638
-Un cadeau.
-What?

309
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:33,718
-A present.
-Un cadeau.

310
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:35,800
Oui, allons-y. Let's go.

311
00:29:59,249 --> 00:30:00,364
What happens now?

312
00:30:00,449 --> 00:30:05,318
Well, now, Lancelot, Galahad,
and l wait until nightfall...

313
00:30:05,569 --> 00:30:09,562
...and then leap out of the rabbit,
taking the French by surprise.

314
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:12,563
Not only by surprise, but totally unarmed!

315
00:30:13,529 --> 00:30:14,723
Who leaps out?

316
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:17,723
Lancelot, Galahad, and l...

317
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:20,767
...leap out of the rabbit.

318
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:29,401
Look. lf we built this large,
wooden badger....

319
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:35,524
Run away!

320
00:30:44,889 --> 00:30:47,357
-History for Schools. Take 8.
-Action!

321
00:30:47,769 --> 00:30:51,444
Defeat at the castle seems to have
utterly disheartened King Arthur.

322
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:55,159
The ferocity of the French taunting
took him completely by surprise.

323
00:30:56,489 --> 00:31:00,562
Arthur became convinced
that a new strategy was required...

324
00:31:00,729 --> 00:31:04,961
...if the quest for the Holy Grail were
to be brought to a successful conclusion.

325
00:31:05,049 --> 00:31:07,768
Arthur, having consulted
his closest knights...

326
00:31:08,169 --> 00:31:12,242
...decided that they should separate,
and search for the Grail individually.

327
00:31:12,649 --> 00:31:14,401
Now, this is what they did--

328
00:31:17,569 --> 00:31:18,558
Frank!

329
00:31:19,969 --> 00:31:23,169
 

330
00:31:26,449 --> 00:31:28,724
The tale of Sir Robin.

331
00:31:29,769 --> 00:31:32,522
So, each of the knights
Went their separate ways.

332
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:35,926
Sir Robin rode north,
through the dark forest of Ewing...

333
00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:38,603
...accompanied by his favourite minstrels.

334
00:31:39,809 --> 00:31:43,358
''Bravely bold Sir Robin
Rode forth from Camelot

335
00:31:44,089 --> 00:31:48,002
''He was not afraid to die
O, Brave Sir Robin

336
00:31:48,369 --> 00:31:52,123
''He was not at all afraid
To be killed in nasty ways

337
00:31:52,569 --> 00:31:55,163
''Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin

338
00:31:56,809 --> 00:32:00,404
''He was not in the least bit scared
To be mashed into a pulp

339
00:32:01,089 --> 00:32:05,162
''Or to have his eyes gouged out
And his elbows broken

340
00:32:05,369 --> 00:32:09,123
''To have his kneecaps split
And his body burned away

341
00:32:09,409 --> 00:32:12,481
''And his limbs all hacked and mangled
Brave Sir Robin

342
00:32:13,889 --> 00:32:15,880
''His head smashed in
And his heart cut out

343
00:32:15,969 --> 00:32:17,800
''His liver removed
And his bowels unplugged

344
00:32:17,889 --> 00:32:20,722
''His nostrils raped, his bottom burned off
And his penis--''

345
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:23,607
That's enough music for now, lads.

346
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,206
Looks like there's dirty work afoot.

347
00:32:28,809 --> 00:32:31,562
Anarcho-syndicalism
is a way of preserving freedom.

348
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:34,959
Dennis, forget about freedom.
Don't drop that mud.

349
00:32:38,369 --> 00:32:40,564
Halt! Who art thou?

350
00:32:40,849 --> 00:32:44,046
-''He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin--''
-Shut up!

351
00:32:45,569 --> 00:32:48,766
Nobody, really. l was just passing through.

352
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:50,243
What do you Want?

353
00:32:50,329 --> 00:32:52,604
-''To fight and--''
-Shut up!

354
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,607
Nothing. Nothing, really.

355
00:32:56,529 --> 00:32:59,680
-Just to pass through, good Sir Knight.
-I'm afraid not.

356
00:33:01,569 --> 00:33:06,245
-Actually, l am a knight of the Round Table.
-You're a knight of the Round Table?

357
00:33:06,729 --> 00:33:07,605
l am.

358
00:33:07,689 --> 00:33:09,839
-In that case, I have to kill you.
-Shall I?

359
00:33:09,929 --> 00:33:12,045
-I don't think so.
-What do I think?

360
00:33:12,129 --> 00:33:13,881
-Kill him.
-Let's be nice to him.

361
00:33:13,969 --> 00:33:15,038
-Shut up.
-But--

362
00:33:15,129 --> 00:33:15,845
And you!

363
00:33:15,929 --> 00:33:18,079
Get the sword out.
I Want to cut his head off!

364
00:33:18,169 --> 00:33:20,888
-Cut your own head off.
-Yes, do us all a favour.

365
00:33:20,969 --> 00:33:22,925
-What?
-Yapping on all the time.

366
00:33:23,009 --> 00:33:25,648
-You're lucky you're not next to him.
-What do you mean?

367
00:33:25,729 --> 00:33:27,685
-You snore.
-I don't.

368
00:33:27,889 --> 00:33:30,926
-You've got bad breath.
-Only because you don't brush my teeth.

369
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,284
Stop bitching, and let's go and have tea!

370
00:33:33,369 --> 00:33:37,328
All right! We'll kill him first,
and then have tea and biscuits.

371
00:33:37,409 --> 00:33:38,683
-Yes.
-Not biscuits.

372
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:42,079
All right! Not biscuits.
But let's kill him anyway.

373
00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:43,204
Right.

374
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:47,919
-He's buggered off!
-So he has! He's scarpered.

375
00:33:48,009 --> 00:33:50,318
-''Brave Sir Robin ran away''
-No!

376
00:33:50,409 --> 00:33:53,287
-''Bravely ran away, away''
-l didn't.

377
00:33:54,169 --> 00:33:57,923
''When danger reared its ugly head
He bravely turned his tail and fled

378
00:33:58,009 --> 00:34:01,718
''Yes, Brave Sir Robin turned about
And gallantly he chickened out

379
00:34:02,089 --> 00:34:05,764
''Bravely taking to his feet
He beat a very brave retreat

380
00:34:05,969 --> 00:34:08,722
-''Bravest of the brave, Sir Robin''
-l never!

381
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,837
''Pie Jesu Domine

382
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:19,687
''Dona eis requiem''

384
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,639
The tale of Sir Galahad.

385
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:36,040
Open the door.

386
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:40,161
In the name of King Arthur, open the door!

387
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:49,759
Hello!

388
00:35:50,369 --> 00:35:53,964
Welcome, gentle Sir Knight.
Welcome to the Castle Anthrax.

389
00:35:55,169 --> 00:35:57,444
-The Castle Anthrax?
-Yes.

390
00:35:58,449 --> 00:36:00,405
it痴 not a very good name, is it?

391
00:36:00,489 --> 00:36:04,846
But we are nice, and we will attend
to your every, every need!

392
00:36:05,729 --> 00:36:08,004
You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?

393
00:36:08,129 --> 00:36:10,404
-The what?
-The Grail. It is here?

394
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:14,202
But you are tired,
and you must rest awhile.

395
00:36:14,689 --> 00:36:16,042
Midget! Crapper!

396
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:19,241
-Yes, O Zoot?
-Prepare a bed for our guest.

397
00:36:19,689 --> 00:36:22,157
-Thank you, Zoot.
-Thank you.

398
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:23,881
Away, away, varletesses!

399
00:36:25,569 --> 00:36:29,528
The beds here are warm and soft,
and very, very big.

400
00:36:30,009 --> 00:36:32,648
-Look, l--
-What is your name, handsome knight?

401
00:36:32,969 --> 00:36:34,960
Sir Galahad the Chaste.

402
00:36:36,129 --> 00:36:38,962
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot.

403
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:43,603
-But come.
-Please, in God's name, show me the Grail.

404
00:36:44,809 --> 00:36:47,642
You have suffered much. You are delirious.

405
00:36:47,729 --> 00:36:50,368
-Look, l have seen it. It is here.
-Sir Galahad!

406
00:36:50,449 --> 00:36:54,237
You would not be so ungallant
as to refuse our hospitality.

407
00:36:57,169 --> 00:37:02,289
I知 afraid our life must seem very dull
and quiet, compared to yours.

408
00:37:03,009 --> 00:37:07,799
We're 8 score blondes and brunettes,
all between 16 and 19 and a half...

409
00:37:08,249 --> 00:37:11,207
...cut off in this castle,
with no one to protect us.

410
00:37:12,289 --> 00:37:13,768
It is a lonely life.

411
00:37:14,489 --> 00:37:19,358
Bathing, dressing, undressing,
making exciting underwear.

412
00:37:20,809 --> 00:37:23,243
We are just not used to handsome knights.

413
00:37:23,569 --> 00:37:26,037
Nay. Come. You may lie here.

414
00:37:28,129 --> 00:37:30,438
-But you are wounded!
-No, it's nothing!

415
00:37:30,729 --> 00:37:35,723
You must see the doctors immediately.
Please, lie down.

416
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:41,884
-Well, what seems to be the trouble?
-They're doctors?

417
00:37:43,089 --> 00:37:45,205
They have a basic medical training.

418
00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:48,169
Come, come, you must try to rest.

419
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,807
Dr. Piglet! Dr. Winston! Practice your art.

420
00:37:58,969 --> 00:38:01,688
-Try to relax.
-Are you sure that's absolutely necessary?

421
00:38:02,129 --> 00:38:03,562
We must examine you.

422
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,640
-There's nothing wrong with that.
-Please. We are doctors.

423
00:38:11,969 --> 00:38:13,482
Look, this cannot be.

424
00:38:14,009 --> 00:38:16,204
-l am sworn to chastity!
-Back to your bed!

425
00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:18,962
Torment me no longer.
l have seen the Grail.

426
00:38:19,289 --> 00:38:22,008
-There's no Grail here.
-l have seen it.

427
00:38:23,049 --> 00:38:24,528
-l have seen--
-Hello.

428
00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:31,317
Hello.

429
00:38:43,009 --> 00:38:46,849
 

430
00:38:50,249 --> 00:38:53,844
-Zoot!
-l am Zoot's identical twin sister, Dingo.

431
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:57,603
-Where are you going?
-l seek the Grail.

432
00:38:57,729 --> 00:38:59,845
l have seen it here in this castle!

433
00:39:00,889 --> 00:39:05,087
Oh, no. Bad, bad Zoot!

434
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:08,606
-What is it?
-Wicked, bad, naughty Zoot!

435
00:39:09,089 --> 00:39:13,128
She has been setting light to our beacon,
which is Grail-shaped.

436
00:39:13,529 --> 00:39:15,759
it痴 not the first time
we've had this problem.

437
00:39:15,849 --> 00:39:17,487
it痴 not the real Grail?

438
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:20,567
Wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot.

439
00:39:20,689 --> 00:39:23,886
She is a bad person,
and must pay the penalty.

440
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,679
Do you think this scene
should have been cut?

441
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:30,522
We were so worried
when the boys were writing it.

442
00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:33,806
But now we're glad. it痴 better
than some previous scenes, l think.

443
00:39:34,169 --> 00:39:35,602
Ours Was better visually.

444
00:39:35,689 --> 00:39:38,328
Ours was committed.
It wasn't a string of pussy jokes.

445
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:40,843
-Get on with it.
-Yes. Get on with it!

446
00:39:40,929 --> 00:39:43,443
Get on with it!

447
00:39:44,009 --> 00:39:47,604
-l am enjoying this scene.
-Get on with it!

448
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,168
Wicked, wicked Zoot!

449
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:57,001
She must pay the penalty.

450
00:39:57,209 --> 00:40:01,805
In Castle Anthrax, we have a punishment
for setting alight the Grail-shaped beacon.

451
00:40:02,409 --> 00:40:05,207
You must tie her down on a bed,
and spank her.

452
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:07,445
A spanking! A spanking!

453
00:40:07,609 --> 00:40:11,363
You must spank her, and after you've
spanked her, deal with her as you like.

454
00:40:11,449 --> 00:40:13,644
-And, then, spank me.
-And me!

455
00:40:13,729 --> 00:40:14,798
-And me.
-And me.

456
00:40:14,889 --> 00:40:17,278
Yes. You must give us all
a good spanking!

457
00:40:17,369 --> 00:40:18,848
A spanking!

458
00:40:20,689 --> 00:40:25,843
-And, after the spanking, the oral sex.
-The oral sex!

459
00:40:26,609 --> 00:40:28,600
Well, l could stay a bit longer.

460
00:40:28,729 --> 00:40:30,765
-Sir Galahad!
-Hello.

461
00:40:30,849 --> 00:40:33,158
-Quick! You are in great peril.
-Why?

462
00:40:33,249 --> 00:40:35,479
-No, he isn't!
-Silence, foul temptress!

463
00:40:35,569 --> 00:40:37,764
-She's got a point.
-We'll cover your escape!

464
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:40,488
-Look, I知 fine!
-Wait, Sir Galahad!

465
00:40:40,569 --> 00:40:44,642
-l can tackle this lot single-handed!
-Yes, let him tackle us single-handed!

466
00:40:45,649 --> 00:40:47,048
No, Sir Galahad. Come!

467
00:40:47,129 --> 00:40:49,359
Honestly, l can handle this lot easily!

468
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:51,963
-Yes, let him handle us easily.
-No, sir. Quick!

469
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:55,359
Wait! Please! l can defeat them!
There's only 150 of them!

470
00:40:55,689 --> 00:40:58,362
He'll beat us easily. We haven't a chance.

471
00:41:02,329 --> 00:41:03,523
Oh, shit!

472
00:41:03,889 --> 00:41:06,528
-You were in great peril.
-l don't think l was.

473
00:41:06,609 --> 00:41:08,042
You were in terrible peril.

474
00:41:08,129 --> 00:41:11,166
-Let me go back, and face the peril.
-No, it's too perilous.

475
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:13,484
it痴 my duty to sample as much peril
as l can.

476
00:41:13,569 --> 00:41:15,241
We've got to find the Holy Grail.

477
00:41:15,329 --> 00:41:17,968
-Let me have just a bit of peril?
-No. it痴 unhealthy.

478
00:41:18,049 --> 00:41:20,005
-l bet you're gay.
-No, I知 not.

479
00:41:21,489 --> 00:41:25,084
Sir Lancelot had saved Sir Galahad
from almost certain temptation.

480
00:41:25,369 --> 00:41:27,803
But, they Were still no nearer the Grail.

481
00:41:28,089 --> 00:41:31,604
King Arthur and Sir Bedevere,
not more than a swallow痴 flight away...

482
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:33,520
...had discovered something.

483
00:41:34,529 --> 00:41:36,963
That's an unladen swallow痴 flight,
obviously.

484
00:41:37,049 --> 00:41:39,404
They Were more than
two laden swallow痴 flights away.

485
00:41:39,489 --> 00:41:41,639
Four, With a coconut
on a line between them.

486
00:41:41,729 --> 00:41:43,287
If the birds Were--

487
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:45,200
Get on with it!

488
00:41:45,289 --> 00:41:46,244
Oh, anyway...

489
00:41:46,329 --> 00:41:49,685
...on to Scene 24, Which is a smashing
scene, With some lovely acting...

490
00:41:49,769 --> 00:41:51,839
...in Which Arthur discovers a vital clue.

491
00:41:51,929 --> 00:41:54,727
There aren't any swallows,
but I think you can hear a--

492
00:41:56,569 --> 00:42:00,244
And this enchanter of whom you speak,
he has seen the Grail?

493
00:42:00,369 --> 00:42:04,609
 

494
00:42:05,249 --> 00:42:06,682
Where does he live?

495
00:42:06,889 --> 00:42:08,402
Old man, where does he live?

496
00:42:09,689 --> 00:42:14,365
He knows of a cave.
A cave which no man has entered.

497
00:42:14,769 --> 00:42:18,205
-And the Grail. The Grail is there?
-There is much danger.

498
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:22,682
For beyond the cave
lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril...

499
00:42:23,209 --> 00:42:25,518
...which no man has ever crossed.

500
00:42:25,969 --> 00:42:28,278
But the Grail. Where is the Grail?

501
00:42:28,929 --> 00:42:31,807
Seek you the Bridge of Death.

502
00:42:33,449 --> 00:42:36,043
The Bridge of Death?
Which leads to the Grail?

503
00:43:19,449 --> 00:43:24,204
-Who are you?
-We are the knights who say, ''Ni''!

504
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:26,803
-No! Not the knights who say ''Ni''?
-The same!

505
00:43:26,889 --> 00:43:30,484
-Who are they?
-We are the keepers of the sacred words.

506
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:34,206
''Ni,'' ''Peng,'' and ''Neee Wom''!

507
00:43:35,009 --> 00:43:37,398
Those who hear them
seldom live to tell the tale.

508
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:41,687
The knights who say, ''Ni''
demand a sacrifice.

509
00:43:41,769 --> 00:43:44,203
Knights of Ni,
we are but simple travellers...

510
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:46,883
...who seek the enchanter
who lives beyond these woods.

511
00:43:46,969 --> 00:43:48,084
Ni! Ni!

512
00:43:53,809 --> 00:43:58,166
We shall say, ''Ni'' again to you,
if you do not appease us.

513
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:01,761
-What is it you want?
-We want...

514
00:44:02,889 --> 00:44:04,561
...a shrubbery.

515
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:06,398
A what?

516
00:44:06,489 --> 00:44:10,448
-Ni! Ni!
-Please! No more!

517
00:44:10,529 --> 00:44:14,124
-We will find you a shrubbery.
-You must return with a shrubbery...

518
00:44:14,209 --> 00:44:17,440
...or else you will never pass
through this wood...

519
00:44:17,929 --> 00:44:19,282
...alive.

520
00:44:19,569 --> 00:44:21,878
Knights of Ni, you are just and fair.

521
00:44:21,969 --> 00:44:24,722
-We will return with a shrubbery.
-One that looks nice.

522
00:44:24,809 --> 00:44:26,686
-Of course.
-And not too expensive.

523
00:44:26,769 --> 00:44:29,920
-Yes.
-Now go!

524
00:45:02,209 --> 00:45:07,009
 

525
00:45:11,969 --> 00:45:14,164
Stop that! Stop that!

526
00:45:14,329 --> 00:45:17,048
Go on, be off! Go away.

527
00:45:20,089 --> 00:45:21,442
And you, be off!

528
00:45:26,729 --> 00:45:27,718
Bloody weather.

529
00:45:28,289 --> 00:45:30,120
The tale of Sir Lancelot.

530
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:39,407
One day, lad, all this will be yours.

531
00:45:39,529 --> 00:45:41,918
-What, the curtains?
-No, not the curtains.

532
00:45:42,009 --> 00:45:46,287
All that you can see,
stretched out over the hills and valleys.

533
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:48,121
That'll be your kingdom, lad.

534
00:45:48,209 --> 00:45:49,881
-But, Mother.
-Father, lad.

535
00:45:50,049 --> 00:45:53,519
-But, Father, l don't want any of that.
-Listen, lad.

536
00:45:53,649 --> 00:45:58,484
l built this kingdom up from nothing.
When l started here, it was a swamp.

537
00:45:58,809 --> 00:46:01,721
Other kings said l was daft
to build a castle on the swamp.

538
00:46:01,809 --> 00:46:04,801
But l built it all the same to show them.

539
00:46:05,289 --> 00:46:07,007
It sank into the swamp.

540
00:46:07,089 --> 00:46:09,808
So, l built a second one.
That sank into the swamp.

541
00:46:09,889 --> 00:46:13,564
So, l built a third one. That burned down,
fell over, then sank in the swamp.

542
00:46:13,649 --> 00:46:15,560
But the fourth one stayed up.

543
00:46:16,369 --> 00:46:18,360
And that's what you'll get, lad.

544
00:46:18,489 --> 00:46:23,005
-The strongest castle in these isles.
-But l don't want any of that.

545
00:46:23,569 --> 00:46:25,287
-I壇 rather--
-Rather what?

546
00:46:25,489 --> 00:46:27,127
I壇 rather just...

547
00:46:28,489 --> 00:46:31,242
-...sing.
-Stop that.

548
00:46:31,329 --> 00:46:34,002
You're not going into a song
while I知 here!

549
00:46:34,089 --> 00:46:36,319
In 20 minutes, you're marrying a girl...

550
00:46:36,409 --> 00:46:40,243
...whose father owns
the biggest tracts of open land in Britain.

551
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:43,008
-But l don't want land.
-Listen, Alice.

552
00:46:43,089 --> 00:46:44,647
-Herbert.
-Herbert.

553
00:46:44,729 --> 00:46:47,960
We live on a bloody swamp,
we need all the land we can get.

554
00:46:48,529 --> 00:46:51,248
-But l don't like her.
-Don't like her?

555
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:53,408
What's wrong with her?

556
00:46:53,489 --> 00:46:57,607
She's beautiful, she's rich.
She's got huge...

557
00:46:58,289 --> 00:46:59,642
...tracts of land.

558
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:05,523
l know, but l want the girl
that l marry to have...

559
00:47:06,289 --> 00:47:09,599
...a certain special something.

560
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,519
Cut that out!

561
00:47:13,849 --> 00:47:18,161
You're marrying Princess Lucky,
so you'd better get used to the idea!

562
00:47:19,449 --> 00:47:20,438
Guards!

563
00:47:20,889 --> 00:47:24,006
Make sure the Prince doesn't leave
the room until l get him.

564
00:47:24,089 --> 00:47:26,922
Not to leave the room,
even if you come and get him.

565
00:47:27,009 --> 00:47:28,965
No. Until l come and get him.

566
00:47:29,289 --> 00:47:32,361
Until you come and get him,
we're not to enter the room.

567
00:47:32,489 --> 00:47:37,119
No, you stay in the room
and make sure he doesn't leave.

568
00:47:37,409 --> 00:47:39,798
-And you'll come and get him.
-Right.

569
00:47:39,889 --> 00:47:43,404
We don't need to do anything,
apart from stop him entering the room.

570
00:47:43,689 --> 00:47:46,681
-No. Leaving the room.
-Leaving the room, yes.

571
00:47:46,969 --> 00:47:48,925
-All right?
-lf....

572
00:47:49,009 --> 00:47:51,318
-lf we're--
-Yes?

573
00:47:52,929 --> 00:47:55,045
Look, it's quite simple.

574
00:47:55,129 --> 00:47:59,168
You stay here and make sure
he doesn't leave the room.

575
00:48:00,289 --> 00:48:02,280
-All right?
-l remember.

576
00:48:02,489 --> 00:48:04,719
Can he can he leave the room with us?

577
00:48:05,129 --> 00:48:08,804
No, you just keep him in here,
and make sure--

578
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:11,084
Yes! We'll keep him in here, obviously.

579
00:48:11,169 --> 00:48:14,206
-But if he had to leave--
-No. Keep him in here!

580
00:48:14,329 --> 00:48:16,923
-Until you, or anyone--
-Not anyone, just me.

581
00:48:17,009 --> 00:48:19,284
-Just you....
-Get back.

582
00:48:19,609 --> 00:48:20,564
-Right?
-Right.

583
00:48:20,649 --> 00:48:22,560
We'll stay here until you get back.

584
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:25,322
-And make sure he doesn't leave.
-What?

585
00:48:26,609 --> 00:48:29,567
-Make sure he doesn't leave.
-The Prince?

586
00:48:29,649 --> 00:48:32,846
-Yes, make sure he doesn't leave.
-Yes, of course!

587
00:48:32,929 --> 00:48:34,487
l thought you meant him!

588
00:48:34,569 --> 00:48:38,084
It seemed a bit daft
me having to guard him when he's a guard.

589
00:48:38,529 --> 00:48:41,202
-Is that clear?
-Quite clear. No problems.

590
00:48:41,369 --> 00:48:42,358
Right.

591
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:47,003
-Where are you going?
-We're coming with you.

592
00:48:47,089 --> 00:48:51,048
l want you to stay here,
and make sure he doesn't leave.

593
00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:52,723
l see, right.

594
00:48:53,489 --> 00:48:57,004
-But, Father--
-Shut it, and get that suit on.

595
00:49:04,449 --> 00:49:06,280
And no singing!

596
00:49:06,689 --> 00:49:08,520
Go and get a glass of water.

597
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:57,797
-Well taken, Concorde!
-Thank you, sir, most kind.

598
00:49:57,889 --> 00:49:59,368
And again!

599
00:49:59,649 --> 00:50:02,641
Over we go! Good, steady!

600
00:50:02,729 --> 00:50:04,845
Now, the big one!

601
00:50:05,649 --> 00:50:07,605
Come on, Concorde!

602
00:50:08,689 --> 00:50:10,680
Message for you, sir.

603
00:50:13,169 --> 00:50:14,966
Concorde, speak to me!

604
00:50:24,249 --> 00:50:25,841
''To whoever finds this note...

605
00:50:25,929 --> 00:50:29,842
''...l have been imprisoned by my father...

606
00:50:30,209 --> 00:50:32,723
''...who wishes me to marry
against my will.

607
00:50:32,809 --> 00:50:35,243
''Please, please come and rescue me.

608
00:50:35,729 --> 00:50:39,039
''l am in the tall tower of Swamp Castle.''

609
00:50:39,129 --> 00:50:42,280
At last! A call! A cry of distress!

610
00:50:42,369 --> 00:50:45,406
This could be the sign
that leads us to the Holy Grail!

611
00:50:45,529 --> 00:50:49,920
Brave Concorde,
you shall not have died in vain!

612
00:50:50,249 --> 00:50:51,887
I知 not quite dead, sir.

613
00:50:53,889 --> 00:50:56,403
You shall not have been mortally wounded
in vain!

614
00:50:56,489 --> 00:50:58,684
l think l could pull through, sir.

615
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:02,078
-l see.
-l think I知 all right to come with you.

616
00:51:02,169 --> 00:51:03,841
No, sweet Concorde! Stay here.

617
00:51:03,929 --> 00:51:06,966
l will send help as soon as
l have accomplished a daring and...

618
00:51:07,049 --> 00:51:09,688
...heroic rescue in my own particular....

619
00:51:12,849 --> 00:51:14,567
-Idiom, sir?
-Idiom!

620
00:51:14,729 --> 00:51:17,960
-No, l feel fine, actually, sir.
-Farewell, sweet Concorde!

621
00:51:18,929 --> 00:51:21,966
I値l just stay here, shall l, sir?

622
00:51:23,929 --> 00:51:24,998
Yeah.

623
00:52:19,489 --> 00:52:23,489
 

624
00:52:46,849 --> 00:52:47,838
Hey!

625
00:53:37,089 --> 00:53:39,319
You're not allowed to enter the room--

626
00:53:41,289 --> 00:53:44,167
Fair one, behold your servant,
Sir Lancelot of Camelot.

627
00:53:44,249 --> 00:53:48,003
-l have come to take.... I知 terribly sorry.
-You got my note!

628
00:53:48,329 --> 00:53:52,038
-l got a note.
-You've come to rescue me?

629
00:53:52,449 --> 00:53:55,122
-Well, no, you see--
-l knew someone would.

630
00:53:55,409 --> 00:53:59,846
l knew that somewhere out there,
there must be someone--

631
00:54:00,609 --> 00:54:02,725
Stop that! Stop it!

632
00:54:04,209 --> 00:54:05,164
Who are you?

633
00:54:05,249 --> 00:54:06,807
-I知 your son.
-No, not you.

634
00:54:06,889 --> 00:54:09,961
-I知 Sir Lancelot, sir.
-He's come to rescue me, Father.

635
00:54:10,049 --> 00:54:14,088
-Let's not jump to conclusions.
-Did you kill all those guards?

636
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:15,927
Yes. Sorry.

637
00:54:16,009 --> 00:54:18,364
-They cost 50 pounds each.
-I知 awfully sorry.

638
00:54:18,449 --> 00:54:22,362
Don't be afraid of him, Sir Lancelot.
I致e got a rope ready.

639
00:54:23,089 --> 00:54:25,364
You killed eight wedding guests and all!

640
00:54:25,529 --> 00:54:27,759
Well, you see,
l thought your son was a lady.

641
00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:29,123
l can understand that.

642
00:54:29,209 --> 00:54:31,439
-Hurry, Sir Lancelot! Hurry!
-Shut up!

643
00:54:31,529 --> 00:54:34,805
-You only killed the bride's father!
-l didn't mean to.

644
00:54:34,889 --> 00:54:37,528
Didn't mean to?
You put your sword through his head!

645
00:54:37,609 --> 00:54:40,487
-Oh dear, is he all right?
-You kicked the bride in the chest!

646
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:42,958
-it痴 going to cost me a fortune!
-l can explain.

647
00:54:43,049 --> 00:54:46,678
l was in the forest, riding north
from Camelot when l got this note.

648
00:54:46,769 --> 00:54:49,283
-Are you from Camelot?
-Hurry, Sir Lancelot!

649
00:54:49,409 --> 00:54:51,240
I知 a knight of King Arthur, sir.

650
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:54,241
Very nice castle, Camelot.
Very good pig country.

651
00:54:55,089 --> 00:54:58,001
-Is it?
-l am ready!

652
00:54:58,089 --> 00:55:01,684
-Would you like to come have a drink?
-That's awfully nice of you.

653
00:55:02,009 --> 00:55:05,046
-l am ready!
-l mean, to be so understanding.

654
00:55:05,129 --> 00:55:08,883
You see, when I知 in this idiom,
l sometimes get a bit carried away.

655
00:55:15,289 --> 00:55:18,599
Now, this is the main hall.
We'll have all this knocked through--

656
00:55:18,689 --> 00:55:22,238
-There he is!
-Bloody hell.

657
00:55:31,249 --> 00:55:34,844
-Hold it, please!
-See what l mean? l get carried away.

658
00:55:34,929 --> 00:55:37,727
I知 really most awfully sorry.
Sorry, everyone.

659
00:55:37,809 --> 00:55:39,162
He's killed the best man!

660
00:55:40,649 --> 00:55:45,245
Hold it, please, hold it.
This is Sir Lancelot...

661
00:55:45,329 --> 00:55:50,244
...from the Court of Camelot,
a brave and influential knight.

662
00:55:50,649 --> 00:55:53,402
-And my special guest here today.
-Hello.

663
00:55:53,489 --> 00:55:55,002
He killed my auntie!

664
00:55:55,769 --> 00:56:00,206
No, please!
This is supposed to be a happy occasion!

665
00:56:00,289 --> 00:56:04,077
Let's not bicker and argue
about who killed who.

666
00:56:04,809 --> 00:56:09,121
We are here today to witness the union
of two young people...

667
00:56:09,249 --> 00:56:11,479
...in the joyful bond of holy wedlock.

668
00:56:13,049 --> 00:56:16,678
Unfortunately, one of them,
my son Herbert...

669
00:56:17,409 --> 00:56:19,400
...has just fallen to his death.

670
00:56:20,209 --> 00:56:23,565
But l don't want to think I致e lost a son,
so much as...

671
00:56:24,009 --> 00:56:25,647
...gained a daughter.

672
00:56:26,329 --> 00:56:29,446
For, since the tragic death of her father--

673
00:56:29,529 --> 00:56:31,520
He's not quite dead!

674
00:56:32,849 --> 00:56:35,761
Since the near fatal wounding
of her father--

675
00:56:35,849 --> 00:56:38,238
He's getting better!

676
00:56:39,409 --> 00:56:42,606
For, since her own father...

677
00:56:42,689 --> 00:56:45,886
...who, when he seemed about to recover...

678
00:56:46,329 --> 00:56:49,639
...suddenly felt the icy hand of death
upon him.

679
00:56:50,529 --> 00:56:51,644
He's died!

680
00:56:52,129 --> 00:56:55,644
l want his only daughter to look upon me...

681
00:56:55,729 --> 00:57:00,007
...as her own dad, in a very real,
and legally binding sense.

682
00:57:01,769 --> 00:57:06,285
And l feel sure that the merger....
The union between the Princess...

683
00:57:06,969 --> 00:57:10,518
...and the brave but dangerous
Sir Lancelot of Camelot--

684
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:13,927
-What?
-Look, the dead Prince!

685
00:57:16,529 --> 00:57:19,885
-He's not quite dead!
-l feel much better.

686
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:22,722
You fell out of the tall tower, you creep!

687
00:57:23,009 --> 00:57:26,638
-No, l was saved at the last minute.
-How?

688
00:57:26,889 --> 00:57:28,481
I値l tell you.

689
00:57:29,769 --> 00:57:32,203
Not like that! Not like that.

690
00:57:32,289 --> 00:57:35,759
''He's going tell
He's going to tell''

691
00:57:35,809 --> 00:57:39,649
 

692
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:41,920
Quickly, sir, come this way!

693
00:57:42,009 --> 00:57:45,718
No, it's not right for my idiom.
l must escape more....

694
00:57:47,529 --> 00:57:50,601
-Dramatically, sir?
-Dramatically.

695
00:58:02,249 --> 00:58:04,683
Excuse me,
could somebody give me a push, please?

696
00:58:14,386 --> 00:58:17,906
 

697
00:58:19,946 --> 00:58:21,538
Old crone!

698
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:26,456
Is there anywhere in this town
where we could buy a shrubbery?

699
00:58:27,266 --> 00:58:30,622
-Who sent you?
-The knights who say, ''Ni''!

700
00:58:30,746 --> 00:58:33,465
No! We have no shrubberies here.

701
00:58:33,546 --> 00:58:37,505
lf you do not tell us where we can buy
a shrubbery, my friend and l...

702
00:58:37,866 --> 00:58:39,060
...will say....

703
00:58:40,226 --> 00:58:42,945
We will say, ''Ni.''

704
00:58:43,506 --> 00:58:44,780
Do your worst!

705
00:58:44,866 --> 00:58:48,825
Very well.
lf you will not assist us voluntarily...

706
00:58:52,386 --> 00:58:53,501
-...Ni!
-No!

707
00:58:54,226 --> 00:58:56,421
Never. No shrubberies.

708
00:58:56,746 --> 00:58:58,386
-Ni!
-Noo!

709
00:58:58,386 --> 00:59:00,422
No, it's not that, it's ''Ni.''

710
00:59:00,466 --> 00:59:03,386
 

711
00:59:03,626 --> 00:59:04,946
No, you're not doing it properly.

712
00:59:04,946 --> 00:59:06,299
-Ni.
-You've got it.

713
00:59:06,386 --> 00:59:08,456
-Ni!
-Ni!

714
00:59:08,546 --> 00:59:11,504
Are you saying ''Ni'' to that old woman?

715
00:59:12,546 --> 00:59:13,376
Yes.

716
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:18,494
What sad times are these when passing
ruffians can say, ''Ni'' at will to old ladies.

717
00:59:19,066 --> 00:59:22,138
There is a pestilence upon this land.
Nothing is sacred.

718
00:59:22,466 --> 00:59:26,095
Even those who arrange shrubberies
are under considerable economic stress...

719
00:59:26,186 --> 00:59:28,097
...at this period in history.

720
00:59:28,186 --> 00:59:30,780
-Did you say ''shrubberies''?
-Yes.

721
00:59:30,866 --> 00:59:33,778
Shrubberies are my trade.
l am a shrubber.

722
00:59:33,866 --> 00:59:38,257
My name is Roger the Shrubber.
l arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.

723
00:59:39,026 --> 00:59:41,142
-Ni!
-No!

724
00:59:42,106 --> 00:59:44,939
Knights of Ni,
we have brought you your shrubbery.

725
00:59:45,026 --> 00:59:47,256
-May we go?
-It is a good shrubbery.

726
00:59:47,466 --> 00:59:51,618
l like the laurels particularly.
But there is one small problem.

727
00:59:52,146 --> 00:59:53,215
What is that?

728
00:59:53,306 --> 00:59:57,106
We are now no longer
the knights who say ''Ni.''

729
00:59:57,106 --> 00:59:58,506
We are now the knights who say:

730
00:59:58,506 --> 01:00:00,098
''Ekke Ekke Ekke Ptang Zoo Boing''!

731
01:00:00,146 --> 01:00:04,466
 

732
01:00:04,706 --> 01:00:06,706
Therefore, we must give you a test.

733
01:00:06,706 --> 01:00:10,176
What's is this test,
knights who until recently said ''Ni''?

734
01:00:10,866 --> 01:00:12,936
Firstly, you must find...

735
01:00:13,626 --> 01:00:15,298
...another shrubbery!

736
01:00:16,426 --> 01:00:18,781
Not another shrubbery!

737
01:00:18,866 --> 01:00:22,461
Then you must bring it here
beside this shrubbery.

738
01:00:22,666 --> 01:00:26,056
Higher, so you get the two-level effect,
a path going down the middle.

739
01:00:26,146 --> 01:00:28,102
A path! A path!

740
01:00:28,186 --> 01:00:31,178
Then, when you have found
the shrubberies...

741
01:00:31,546 --> 01:00:34,697
...you must cut down
the mightiest tree in the forest...

742
01:00:35,426 --> 01:00:38,463
...with a herring!

743
01:00:39,666 --> 01:00:42,226
-We shall do no such thing.
-Please.

744
01:00:42,626 --> 01:00:45,618
Cut down a tree with a herring?
It can't be done.

745
01:00:47,306 --> 01:00:49,103
-Don't say that word.
-What word?

746
01:00:49,186 --> 01:00:51,097
l cannot tell. Suffice to say...

747
01:00:51,186 --> 01:00:53,780
...it's one of the words
the knights of Ni cannot hear.

748
01:00:53,866 --> 01:00:56,664
How can we not say the word
if you don't tell us what it is?

749
01:00:56,746 --> 01:00:58,782
-He did it again.
-What? ''Is''?

750
01:01:00,186 --> 01:01:02,620
You wouldn't get very far in life
not saying ''is.''

751
01:01:03,306 --> 01:01:04,739
My liege, it's Robin.

752
01:01:04,826 --> 01:01:09,058
''He's jacking it in and packing it up
And sneaking away and buggering up

753
01:01:09,146 --> 01:01:13,583
''And chickening out and pissing a pot
Yes, bravely he is throwing in the sponge''

754
01:01:13,666 --> 01:01:14,860
-Robin.
-My liege.

755
01:01:14,946 --> 01:01:16,504
it痴 good to see you.

756
01:01:16,586 --> 01:01:19,054
You haven't given up your quest
for the Holy Grail?

757
01:01:19,146 --> 01:01:21,501
-''He is sneaking away and--''
-Shut up!

758
01:01:21,986 --> 01:01:24,375
-No, far from it.
-You said the word again.

759
01:01:24,466 --> 01:01:28,857
l was looking for it here in this forest.

760
01:01:29,066 --> 01:01:33,218
-No, it is far from this place.
-Stop saying the word!

761
01:01:33,306 --> 01:01:35,661
-The word we cannot hear!
-Stop it!

762
01:01:35,826 --> 01:01:37,782
-He said, ''it'' again!
-That's it!

763
01:01:37,866 --> 01:01:40,744
I致e said, ''it.'' I致e said, ''it.''
I致e said, ''it'' again!

764
01:01:40,826 --> 01:01:42,942
That's three ''its''!

765
01:01:48,906 --> 01:01:53,184
And so Arthur and Bedevere and
Sir Robin set out on their search to find...

766
01:01:53,266 --> 01:01:57,020
...the enchanter of Whom
the old man had spoken in Scene 24.

767
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:01,225
Beyond the forest
they met Lancelot and Galahad...

768
01:02:01,306 --> 01:02:03,615
...and there Was much rejoicing.

769
01:02:05,426 --> 01:02:10,026
 

770
01:02:14,666 --> 01:02:16,782
In the frozen land of Nador...

771
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:19,539
...they Were forced to eat
Robin's minstrels.

772
01:02:20,186 --> 01:02:22,700
And there Was much rejoicing.

773
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:25,498
A year passed.

774
01:02:29,186 --> 01:02:31,541
Winter changed into spring.

775
01:02:32,066 --> 01:02:34,102
Spring changed into summer.

776
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:36,981
Summer changed back into Winter...

777
01:02:37,066 --> 01:02:42,299
...and Winter gave spring and summer
a miss and went straight on into autumn.

778
01:02:42,666 --> 01:02:43,815
Until one day.

779
01:03:05,146 --> 01:03:07,102
Knights...

780
01:03:07,626 --> 01:03:08,820
...forward!

781
01:03:33,266 --> 01:03:38,706
 

782
01:03:44,226 --> 01:03:46,740
What manner of man are you,
that can summon up fire...

783
01:03:46,826 --> 01:03:51,456
-...without flint or tinder?
-l am an enchanter.

784
01:03:54,066 --> 01:03:57,741
-By what name are you known?
-There are some who call me...

785
01:03:59,746 --> 01:04:02,340
-...Tim.
-Greetings, Tim the enchanter!

786
01:04:02,426 --> 01:04:04,701
Greetings, King Arthur.

787
01:04:05,506 --> 01:04:07,098
-You know my name?
-l do.

788
01:04:14,826 --> 01:04:17,420
You seek the Holy Grail.

789
01:04:18,026 --> 01:04:20,984
That is our quest.
You know much that is hidden, Tim.

790
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:22,215
Quite.

791
01:04:30,146 --> 01:04:32,455
Yes, we are looking for the Holy Grail.

792
01:04:32,706 --> 01:04:36,460
-Our quest is to find the Holy Grail.
-Yes, it is.

793
01:04:39,546 --> 01:04:42,663
-And so we're looking for it.
-Yes, we are.

794
01:04:42,746 --> 01:04:45,465
-We have been for some time.
-Ages.

795
01:04:47,986 --> 01:04:52,218
So, anything you could do to help
would be...

796
01:04:54,586 --> 01:04:55,655
...very...

797
01:04:56,906 --> 01:04:59,579
-...helpful.
-Look, can you tell us where--

798
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:06,178
Fine, l don't want to waste
any more of your time...

799
01:05:06,266 --> 01:05:10,020
...but l don't suppose you could tell us
where we might find a....

800
01:05:12,986 --> 01:05:14,544
A what?

801
01:05:16,626 --> 01:05:18,139
A grail?

802
01:05:18,226 --> 01:05:20,296
Yes, l think so.

803
01:05:20,826 --> 01:05:21,861
Yes.

804
01:05:22,986 --> 01:05:24,055
Yes!

805
01:05:26,186 --> 01:05:28,905
-Thank you.
-Splendid!

806
01:05:32,586 --> 01:05:35,054
Look, you're a busy man--

807
01:05:35,146 --> 01:05:39,617
Yes, l can help you find the Holy Grail.

808
01:05:40,026 --> 01:05:44,622
To the north, there lies a cave.
The Cave of Caerbannog.

809
01:05:44,706 --> 01:05:48,745
Wherein, carved in mystic runes,
upon the very living rock...

810
01:05:49,306 --> 01:05:52,503
...the last words
of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged...

811
01:05:54,546 --> 01:05:59,301
...make plain the last resting place
of the most Holy Grail.

812
01:06:00,146 --> 01:06:03,138
-Where could we find this cave, Tim?
-Follow!

813
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:08,465
But follow only if ye be men of valour.

814
01:06:08,906 --> 01:06:12,182
For the entrance to this cave
is guarded by a creature...

815
01:06:12,666 --> 01:06:15,783
...so foul, so cruel...

816
01:06:15,866 --> 01:06:18,983
...that no man yet
has fought with it and lived.

817
01:06:20,186 --> 01:06:27,137
Bones of full 50 men lie strewn
about its lair. So, brave knights...

818
01:06:27,226 --> 01:06:33,256
...if you do doubt your courage
or your strength, come no further...

819
01:06:33,346 --> 01:06:38,340
...for death awaits you all
with nasty, big, pointy teeth.

820
01:06:40,626 --> 01:06:42,423
What an eccentric performance!

821
01:06:55,426 --> 01:06:56,779
They're nervous, sire.

822
01:06:56,866 --> 01:06:59,380
Then we'd best leave them here
and carry on, on foot.

823
01:06:59,466 --> 01:07:01,457
Dismount!

824
01:07:13,506 --> 01:07:17,340
Behold the Cave of Caerbannog!

825
01:07:19,666 --> 01:07:22,658
-Right, keep me covered.
-What with?

826
01:07:23,386 --> 01:07:25,661
-Just keep me covered.
-Too late.

827
01:07:26,946 --> 01:07:28,061
There he is!

828
01:07:31,026 --> 01:07:33,096
-Where?
-There.

829
01:07:34,106 --> 01:07:37,018
-What, behind the rabbit?
-It is the rabbit.

830
01:07:39,066 --> 01:07:41,421
-You silly sod!
-What?

831
01:07:41,506 --> 01:07:42,905
You got us all worked up.

832
01:07:42,986 --> 01:07:44,624
That's no ordinary rabbit.

833
01:07:44,706 --> 01:07:49,541
That's the most foul, cruel and
bad-tempered rodent you ever set eyes on.

834
01:07:49,626 --> 01:07:53,096
You tit! l soiled my armour
l was so scared!

835
01:07:53,226 --> 01:07:56,582
Look, that rabbit's got
a vicious streak a mile wide.

836
01:07:56,666 --> 01:07:58,577
-it痴 a killer!
-Get stuffed.

837
01:07:58,666 --> 01:08:00,896
-He'll do you up a treat, mate!
-Yeah?

838
01:08:00,986 --> 01:08:03,420
-You manky Scots git!
-I知 warning you.

839
01:08:03,506 --> 01:08:07,021
-What's he do? Nibble your bum?
-He's got huge, sharp....

840
01:08:08,026 --> 01:08:09,698
It can leap about....

841
01:08:10,146 --> 01:08:13,422
-Look at the bones!
-Go on, Bors, chop its head off.

842
01:08:13,546 --> 01:08:17,095
Right. Silly little bleeder.
One rabbit stew coming right up.

843
01:08:18,786 --> 01:08:19,935
Look!

844
01:08:19,986 --> 01:08:23,186
 

845
01:08:23,546 --> 01:08:26,583
-Jesus Christ!
-l warned you!

846
01:08:26,666 --> 01:08:28,657
-I致e done it again.
-l warned you.

847
01:08:28,746 --> 01:08:31,943
But did you listen to me?
No, you knew it all, didn't you?

848
01:08:32,106 --> 01:08:36,463
it痴 just a harmless little bunny, isn't it?
Well, it's always the same.

849
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:39,060
-l always--
-Shut up!

850
01:08:40,466 --> 01:08:42,218
Charge!

851
01:08:58,226 --> 01:09:00,581
Run away!

852
01:09:09,586 --> 01:09:11,542
-How many did we lose?
-Gawain.

853
01:09:11,626 --> 01:09:13,582
-Ector.
-And Bors. That's five.

854
01:09:13,666 --> 01:09:15,543
-Three.
-Three.

855
01:09:15,906 --> 01:09:19,421
We better not risk another frontal assault,
that rabbit's dynamite.

856
01:09:19,506 --> 01:09:22,020
Would it help to confuse it
if we run away more?

857
01:09:22,106 --> 01:09:25,337
-Shut up and change your armour.
-Let us taunt it.

858
01:09:25,426 --> 01:09:28,099
It may become so cross,
that it will make a mistake.

859
01:09:28,186 --> 01:09:29,255
Like what?

860
01:09:30,506 --> 01:09:31,495
Well....

861
01:09:34,546 --> 01:09:36,423
-Have we got bows?
-No.

862
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:38,781
-We have the Holy Hand Grenade.
-Yes, of course!

863
01:09:38,866 --> 01:09:40,538
The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch.

864
01:09:40,626 --> 01:09:43,345
it痴 one of the sacred relics
Brother Maynard carries.

865
01:09:43,426 --> 01:09:46,384
Brother Maynard!
Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade.

866
01:10:11,986 --> 01:10:15,986
 

867
01:10:16,586 --> 01:10:17,814
How does it....

868
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:19,621
How does it work?

869
01:10:19,706 --> 01:10:22,425
-l know not, my liege.
-Consult the Book of Armaments.

870
01:10:22,506 --> 01:10:26,135
Armaments 2: 9-21.

871
01:10:29,346 --> 01:10:33,100
''And St. Attila raised the hand grenade
up on high, saying:

872
01:10:33,786 --> 01:10:37,745
'''O Lord, bless this thy hand grenade,
that with it thou mayest...

873
01:10:37,826 --> 01:10:41,341
'''...blow thine enemies
to tiny bits, in thy mercy.'

874
01:10:41,986 --> 01:10:44,944
''And the Lord did grin
and the people did feast upon...

875

''...the lambs and sloths and carp
and anchovies and orangutans...

''...and breakfast cereals

877
01:10:52,706 --> 01:10:54,139
Skip a bit, Brother.

878
01:10:55,866 --> 01:11:00,417
''The Lord spake, saying,
'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin...

'''...then shalt thou count to three,

Amen.

890
01:11:38,346 --> 01:11:39,335
Amen.

891
01:11:39,426 --> 01:11:40,461
Right.

892
01:11:41,106 --> 01:11:43,256
One, two, five!

893
01:11:43,346 --> 01:11:45,143
-Three, sir!
-Three!

894
01:11:46,706 --> 01:11:50,706
.

895
01:12:29,226 --> 01:12:30,659
There! Look!

896
01:12:31,546 --> 01:12:33,821
What does it say? What language is that?

897
01:12:33,906 --> 01:12:36,056
Brother Maynard, you're our scholar.

898
01:12:36,226 --> 01:12:37,705
It is Aramaic!

899
01:12:38,026 --> 01:12:40,779
Of course. Joseph of Arimathea!

900
01:12:41,106 --> 01:12:43,097
-Of course.
-What does it say?

901
01:12:43,226 --> 01:12:46,423
It reads, ''Here may be found...

902
01:12:46,506 --> 01:12:49,976
''...the last words of Joseph of Arimathea:

903
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:53,783
'''He who is valiant and pure of spirit...

904
01:12:54,546 --> 01:12:56,662
'''...may find the Holy Grail...

905
01:12:56,986 --> 01:13:01,104
'''...in the Castle of Aaargh.'''

906
01:13:02,946 --> 01:13:04,061
What?

907
01:13:04,786 --> 01:13:08,461
''The Castle of Aaargh.''

908
01:13:09,106 --> 01:13:10,300
What is that?

909
01:13:10,826 --> 01:13:12,942
He must have died while carving it.

910
01:13:13,026 --> 01:13:15,745
-Come on!
-That's what it says.

911
01:13:15,866 --> 01:13:19,302
Look, if he was dying,
he wouldn't bother to carve ''Aaargh.''

912
01:13:19,506 --> 01:13:22,782
-He'd just say it.
-That's what's carved in the rock.

913
01:13:23,146 --> 01:13:25,057
-Perhaps he was dictating it.
-Shut up!

914
01:13:25,146 --> 01:13:27,341
-Does it say anything else?
-No!

915
01:13:27,426 --> 01:13:30,543
Just ''Aaargh.''

916
01:13:32,426 --> 01:13:34,735
Aaargh.

917
01:13:34,826 --> 01:13:38,421
Do you suppose he meant the Camargue?

918
01:13:38,506 --> 01:13:40,417
-Where's that?
-In France, l think.

919
01:13:40,506 --> 01:13:45,102
-Isn稚 there a St. Aaargh's in Cornwall?
-No, that's St. lves.

920
01:13:45,386 --> 01:13:47,456
St. lves.

921
01:13:49,546 --> 01:13:51,980
No, ''Aaargh.'' At the back of the throat.

922
01:13:52,066 --> 01:13:55,058
No, in surprise and alarm!

923
01:13:55,306 --> 01:13:57,945
-You mean a sort of a ''Ah!''
-Yes, that's right.

924
01:13:59,586 --> 01:14:00,541
My God!

925
01:14:03,266 --> 01:14:07,942
it痴 the Legendary Black Beast of Aaargh!

926
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:10,859
That's it! Run away!

927
01:14:12,306 --> 01:14:26,266
.

928
01:14:26,266 --> 01:14:27,494
We've lost him.

929
01:14:29,226 --> 01:14:31,865
As the horrendous Black Beast
lunged forward...

930
01:14:32,546 --> 01:14:35,219
...escape for Arthur
and his knights seemed hopeless.

931
01:14:35,306 --> 01:14:39,140
When, suddenly, the animator
suffered a fatal heart attack.

932
01:14:39,466 --> 01:14:41,934
The cartoon peril Was no more.

933
01:14:42,706 --> 01:14:45,459
The quest for the Holy Grail
could continue.

934
01:14:57,106 --> 01:14:58,664
There it is!

935
01:14:58,906 --> 01:15:02,945
-The Bridge of Death.
-Great.

936
01:15:03,106 --> 01:15:05,939
Look! There's the old man from Scene 24.

937
01:15:06,026 --> 01:15:09,621
-What's he doing here?
-He is the keeper of the Bridge of Death.

938
01:15:10,106 --> 01:15:12,336
He asks each traveller five questions.

939
01:15:12,426 --> 01:15:14,303
-Three questions.
-Three questions.

940
01:15:14,386 --> 01:15:17,822
-He who answers the five questions--
-Three questions.

941
01:15:17,906 --> 01:15:22,184
-Three questions, may cross in safety.
-What if you get a question wrong?

942
01:15:22,266 --> 01:15:25,622
Then you are cast
into the gorge of eternal peril.

943
01:15:25,866 --> 01:15:28,903
-Oh, wacko.
-Who's going to answer the questions?

944
01:15:29,026 --> 01:15:31,745
Brave Sir Robin, you go.

945
01:15:32,466 --> 01:15:34,377
I致e got a great idea:

946
01:15:34,986 --> 01:15:36,465
Why doesn't Lancelot go?

947
01:15:36,546 --> 01:15:39,185
Yes, let me go, my liege.
l will take him single-handed.

948
01:15:39,266 --> 01:15:42,781
-l shall make a feint to the northeast....
-Hang on!

949
01:15:42,986 --> 01:15:45,500
-Just answer the five questions--
-Three questions.

950
01:15:45,586 --> 01:15:49,420
Three questions, as best you can.
And we shall watch and pray.

951
01:15:49,626 --> 01:15:51,378
l understand, my liege.

952
01:15:51,626 --> 01:15:55,096
Good luck, brave Sir Lancelot.
God be with you.

953
01:15:59,386 --> 01:16:00,375
Stop!

954
01:16:01,906 --> 01:16:06,343
Who would cross the Bridge of Death,
must answer me these questions three.

955
01:16:06,506 --> 01:16:08,622
Ere the other side he see.

956
01:16:08,826 --> 01:16:11,704
Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper.
I知 not afraid.

957
01:16:11,946 --> 01:16:15,700
-What is your name?
-My name is Sir Lancelot of Camelot.

958
01:16:16,426 --> 01:16:18,098
What is your quest?

959
01:16:18,346 --> 01:16:20,302
To seek the Holy Grail.

960
01:16:20,786 --> 01:16:22,822
What is your favourite colour?

961
01:16:23,266 --> 01:16:25,416
-Blue.
-Right. Off you go.

962
01:16:26,826 --> 01:16:28,657
Well, thank you very much.

963
01:16:32,946 --> 01:16:34,095
That's easy.

964
01:16:37,026 --> 01:16:38,015
Stop.

965
01:16:38,746 --> 01:16:43,217
Who approacheth the Bridge of Death,
must answer me these questions three.

966
01:16:43,586 --> 01:16:45,702
Ere the other side he see.

967
01:16:46,506 --> 01:16:49,145
Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper.
I知 not afraid.

968
01:16:49,226 --> 01:16:52,696
-What is your name?
-Sir Robin of Camelot.

01:16:56,466 --> 01:16:58,502
What is the capital of Assyria?

971
01:17:01,226 --> 01:17:02,454
l don't know that!

972
01:17:10,866 --> 01:17:11,742
Stop!

973
01:17:12,786 --> 01:17:16,176

-What is your quest?
-To seek the Holy Grail.

980
01:17:42,306 --> 01:17:45,537
What is the air-speed velocity
of an unladen swallow?

981
01:17:46,266 --> 01:17:49,019
What do you mean?
An African or European swallow?

982
01:17:50,026 --> 01:17:51,459
l don't know that!

983
01:17:57,466 --> 01:17:59,741
How do you know
so much about swallows?

984
01:17:59,866 --> 01:18:02,426
You have to know these things
when you're a king.

985
01:18:17,106 --> 01:18:20,946
.

986
01:18:31,346 --> 01:18:36,306
 

987
01:18:40,666 --> 01:18:41,655

Lancelot!

990

The Castle Aaargh. Our quest is at an end.

991
01:20:49,266 --> 01:20:53,426
.

992
01:21:05,826 --> 01:21:07,339
God be praised.

993
01:21:10,786 --> 01:21:12,185
Almighty God...

994
01:21:12,266 --> 01:21:15,975
...we thank thee, that thou hast vouchsafed
to us the most holy--

995
01:21:18,026 --> 01:21:18,663
Jesus Christ!

996
01:21:18,706 --> 01:21:22,226
 

997
01:21:22,466 --> 01:21:23,706
Dirty English knights.

998
01:21:23,706 --> 01:21:26,266
Monsieur Arthur King,
who has the brain of a duck.

999
01:21:26,346 --> 01:21:29,622
So, we French fellows
outwit you a second time.

1000
01:21:29,746 --> 01:21:32,624
How dare you profane this place
with your presence?

l command you,
in the name of the knights of Camelot...

1002

...to open the doors of this sacred castle...

1003
01:21:39,746 --> 01:21:43,056
...to which God himself has guided us.

1004
01:21:43,146 --> 01:21:48,266
How you English say?
I値l unclog my nose in your direction.

1005
01:21:48,346 --> 01:21:49,779
Sons of a window-dresser!

1006
01:21:49,866 --> 01:21:52,334
So, you think you could
out-clever us French folk...

1007
01:21:52,426 --> 01:21:55,816
...with your silly knees-bent,
running about, advancing behaviour.

1008
01:21:55,906 --> 01:21:58,579
l wave my private parts at your aunties.

1009
01:21:58,866 --> 01:22:03,257
You cheesy lot of second-hand,
electric donkey-bottom biters!

1010
01:22:03,346 --> 01:22:05,382
In the name of the Lord...

1011
01:22:05,466 --> 01:22:09,061
...we demand entrance
to this sacred castle!

1012
01:22:09,146 --> 01:22:11,819
No chance, English bed-wetting types.

1013
01:22:11,906 --> 01:22:15,979
l burst my pimples at you, and call your
door-opening request a silly thing!

1014
01:22:16,066 --> 01:22:19,342
You tiny-brained wipers
of other people's bottoms.

1015
01:22:19,426 --> 01:22:22,941
lf you'll not open this door,
we shall take this castle by force!

1016
01:22:24,746 --> 01:22:26,941
In the name of God and the glory of our--

1017
01:22:28,706 --> 01:22:31,140
Right! That settles it!

1018
01:22:31,906 --> 01:22:34,898
Depart at this time,
and don't be approaching any more...

1019
01:22:34,986 --> 01:22:39,502
...or we fire arrows into your heads,
and make castanets out of your testicles.

1020
01:22:39,586 --> 01:22:41,144
Walk away, just ignore them.

1021
01:22:41,226 --> 01:22:44,980
And now remain gone,
illegitimate-faced bugger-folk!

1022
01:22:45,106 --> 01:22:49,577
And, if you think you got a nasty
taunting this time, you ain't heard...

1023
01:22:49,666 --> 01:22:53,056
...nothing yet, dirty English knights!

1024
01:23:14,026 --> 01:23:16,984
-We shall attack at once.
-Yes, my liege.

1025
01:23:17,146 --> 01:23:18,943
Stand by for attack!

1026
01:24:01,106 --> 01:24:04,466
 

1027
01:24:16,146 --> 01:24:17,499
French persons!

1028
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:22,015
Today the blood of many a valiant knight
shall be avenged.

1029
01:24:22,546 --> 01:24:25,743
In the name of God,
we shall not stop our fight...

1030
01:24:25,866 --> 01:24:30,417
...till each one of you lies dead,
and the Holy Grail...

1031
01:24:30,546 --> 01:24:33,982
...returns to those whom God has chosen.

1032
01:24:35,386 --> 01:24:38,264
Charge!

1033
01:24:56,226 --> 01:25:01,106
 

1034
01:25:02,866 --> 01:25:05,175
Yes, they're the ones, I知 sure.

1035
01:25:10,666 --> 01:25:13,134
-Come on.
-Put this man in the van.

1036
01:25:16,906 --> 01:25:19,625
-Put him in the van.
-Get a blanket over that one.

1037
01:25:19,866 --> 01:25:22,334
Come on, back! Right back!

1038
01:25:24,466 --> 01:25:26,616
That's an offensive weapon, that is.

1039
01:25:29,546 --> 01:25:31,776
All right, sonny, that's enough.
Pack that in.

1040
01:25:44,306 --> 01:25:48,146
