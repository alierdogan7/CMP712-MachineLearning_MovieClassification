1
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,239
Where to, Mr. Churchill?

2
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,574
Some large, bright, gay place
with hundreds of beautiful girls.

3
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:58,046
- Some large, bright, gay place.
- With hundreds of beautiful girls.

4
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,083
Yes, sirree.

5
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,483
Isn't that a coincidence,
on the right there?

6
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:17,798
- Thank you, Jeeves. Thank you, Jives.
- Mr. Churchill, hold it, please.

7
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,433
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

8
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,472
- Here we go.
- Evening, Mr. Churchill.

9
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,303
Good evening, Marcus.

10
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:28,539
Why, Mr. Churchill,
you're quite a stranger.

11
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,273
Not to the people that know me.

12
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,940
Girls?

13
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:33,483
Good evening. Hello, fellows.

14
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,018
- Hi, hey.
- How are you?

15
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:36,485
- Why, Mr. Churchill.
- Thomas.

16
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,817
- We certainly have missed you.
- Well, thank you.

17
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,789
You couldn't have picked
a better night.

18
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,723
- Really? Why?
- Tommy Dorsey's opening.

19
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,994
- Hiya, Tom.
- Hello, Dan.

20
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:29,508
<i>I've always been considered</i>
<i>Quite a delicate child</i>

21
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:33,476
<i>Watched over by a governess</i>
<i>And nurse</i>

22
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:37,446
<i>To say I've led a sheltered life</i>
<i>Is putting it mild</i>

23
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:41,519
<i>I promise you it couldn't be much worse</i>

24
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:45,451
<i>Mother always called me</i>
<i>Her hothouse rose</i>

25
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,391
<i>And all the dates I had</i>
<i>Were with hothouse beaus</i>

26
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,362
<i>But now that I am old enough</i>
<i>To cast a few votes</i>

27
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:58,800
<i>I'm going out and sow a few oats</i>

28
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,440
<i>So</i>

29
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:05,271
<i>Treat me rough, muss my hair</i>

30
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:09,006
<i>Don't you dare to handle me with care</i>

31
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:12,777
<i>I'm no innocent child, baby</i>

32
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:16,581
<i>Keep on treating me wild</i>

33
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,053
<i>Treat me rough</i>

34
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,219
<i>Pinch my cheek</i>

35
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:23,954
<i>Kiss and hug and squeeze me</i>
<i>Till I'm weak</i>

36
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,759
<i>I've been pampered enough, baby</i>

37
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,426
<i>Keep on treating me rough</i>

38
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:40,501
<i>Treat me rough, muss my hair</i>

39
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,241
<i>Don't you dare to handle me with care</i>

40
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,944
- <i>I'm no innocent child</i>
- <i>No innocent child</i>

41
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,648
<i>Keep on treating me wild</i>

42
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,485
<i>Treat me rough</i>

43
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,321
<i>Pinch my cheek</i>

44
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:59,158
<i>Kiss and hug and squeeze me</i>
<i>Till I'm weak</i>

45
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:02,460
- <i>I've been pampered enough</i>
- <i>I've been pampered enough</i>

46
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:06,002
<i>Baby, keep on treating me rough</i>

47
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,333
<i>Can't get enough</i>

48
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:12,035
<i>Treat me rough</i>
<i>No one can</i>

49
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:15,806
<i>Don't you dare to handle me with care</i>

50
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,474
<i>I'm no innocent child, baby</i>

51
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:24,555
<i>Keep on treating me wild</i>
<i>Treat me rough</i>

52
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:26,852
<i>Pinch my cheek</i>

53
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:30,484
<i>Kiss and hug and squeeze me</i>
<i>Till I'm weak</i>

54
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:34,258
<i>I've been pampered enough, baby</i>

55
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:37,801
<i>Keep on treating me rough</i>

56
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:04,293
<i>When I was born</i>
<i>They found a silver spoon in my mouth</i>

57
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:08,230
<i>I had a barber just to curl my hair</i>

58
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:12,235
<i>If winter came</i>
<i>The mater carried me to the south</i>

59
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:16,341
<i>The point is that I had the best of care</i>

60
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:20,342
<i>Women and headwaiters fawned on me</i>

61
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:24,040
<i>Life was just a bore till it dawned on me</i>

62
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:28,017
<i>That if I'd ever want to be a man</i>
<i>Amongst men</i>

63
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:33,318
<i>I'd have to be manhandled now and then</i>

64
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:37,554
<i>So treat me rough</i>
<i>Muss my hair</i>

65
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,461
<i>Don't you dare to handle me with care</i>

66
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:45,263
<i>I'm no innocent child, baby</i>

67
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:49,306
<i>Keep on treating me wild</i>

68
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:53,434
<i>Treat me rough, pinch my cheeks</i>

69
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:57,049
<i>Kiss and hug and squeeze me</i>
<i>Until I'm weak</i>

70
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:00,947
<i>I've been pampered enough, baby</i>

71
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,487
<i>Keep on treating me rough</i>

72
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,706
Danny Churchill.

73
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,509
Silly, isn't it, Dad?

74
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,620
- Son.
- Yes, sir?

75
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,813
You're living in a world
of weekend whimsy...

76
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,924
...and growing up to be
a rich man's son.

77
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,583
Surely you don't believe what's
printed in the papers?

78
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,491
"Publisher's son is crowned king.
Danny Jr. "

79
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,155
"Publisher's son stops show. "
Why, it's incredible.

80
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,529
Dad, you know how reporters
like to exaggerate.

81
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:26,570
Any mention of Danny Jr. Winning
academic honors at Yale?

82
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,900
- No. Or even a spelling bee?
- No.

83
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,976
The next thing you know,
you'll be sponsoring a beauty contest.

84
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,135
- It isn't really that bad.
- Now look, Danny.

85
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,247
None of this stuff is actually bad.

86
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,111
But if it keeps on,
you'll get to be known as a character.

87
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:40,513
The first thing you know...

88
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,587
...why, you start living up
to the write-ups and that is bad.

89
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:46,782
And we're not going to let
that happen, are we?

90
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,757
You're right. I'm sorry, Dad.
I'll leave for New Haven today.

91
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,955
No, Danny, you're not going back
to New Haven.

92
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,828
No, you're going to Cody.

93
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,236
Cody? What's that?

94
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:01,635
Cody College of Mines and Agriculture.
It's out West.

95
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:05,174
It has fresh air.
And it is not coeducational.

96
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:08,279
Dad, you can't be serious.
Why, a guy would go daffy out there.

97
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,439
Well, there's a bare possibility
that it might make a man of you.

98
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:14,085
And another thing,
just so it won't be a shock to you.

99
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:17,120
There hasn't been a woman out there
since the Civil War.

100
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,451
Well, that doesn't make any...

101
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:33,799
"Codyville. Two thousand,
eight hundred and fifty feet. "

102
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,349
Hey.

103
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:47,310
Hey!

104
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:50,417
- Where's the hotel in this town?
- Ain't none.

105
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,115
Well, where do people live?

106
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,890
There ain't none.

107
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:59,122
Well, could you tell me
where Cody College is?

108
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:02,131
Down the road, about eight miles.

109
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,064
Well, are there any taxis in the town?

110
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:07,433
Oh, no, don't tell me. I know.
There ain't none.

111
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,871
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

112
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:26,586
"Cody College.
Eight miles. "

113
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:44,203
"Cody College.
Eight miles. "

114
00:10:57,256 --> 00:11:01,818
"Cody College.
Eight miles. "

115
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:54,710
Hey.

116
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,180
Hey!

117
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,544
Having a little trouble?

118
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,252
Why don't you leave it out here
for the buzzards?

119
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:09,756
Well... Well, I'll be.

120
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,089
Hello.

121
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,595
- I said, hello.
- That's what I thought you said.

122
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:17,099
Well, what do people out West say
when somebody says hello to them?

123
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,627
Look, stranger,
why don't you just go away?

124
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,295
Oh, that isn't very nice.

125
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,170
I've been lying under that jumping jack
for a half an hour.

126
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:27,005
- I'm not in the mood for small talk.
- Oh, excuse me.

127
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,306
I just happened to be in
the neighborhood...

128
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,450
...and I thought I'd drop by
to tell you...

129
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:34,848
...that you're the best-looking
automobile mechanic I've ever seen.

130
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,719
Traveling salesman?

131
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:43,189
- What are you laughing at?
- Nothing. I'm just happy.

132
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:46,820
- You're sure it isn<i>'</i>t the sun.
- No, no, it's something about my father.

133
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,934
He sent me out West to get away...
To get away from the girls.

134
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,764
And I find you right out here
in the middle of the desert.

135
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,235
I think it's very funny.

136
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:55,464
- You do?
- Yeah.

137
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,235
Would you go ahead and have
your own private little joke.

138
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,502
I've got things to do.

139
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,717
What are you doing down there?

140
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,243
Grinding coffee.

141
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,978
May I?

142
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,392
Won't talk, eh?

143
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,902
Well, it looks like Hattie here
isn't gonna be very sociable.

144
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,768
Well, I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

145
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,433
There's nothing left for you to do
but to sit here...

146
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,476
...and give me the story of your life.

147
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,844
If I'm not at school in 10 minutes
I'm gonna miss the mail train.

148
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,144
You mean Cody?

149
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,354
You don't mean to tell me
that you're a student there?

150
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,422
No, I carry the mail.

151
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,486
Government's making a big mistake.

152
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,721
They ought to put your picture
on the postage stamps.

153
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:54,365
Well, I can't waste any more time here.

154
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:58,333
Wait a minute, would you?
Let me try it once more, please?

155
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,650
- Well, that's it.
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?

156
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:14,786
Out West, when we're in trouble,
we walk.

157
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:17,149
It's the same in the East.
I'll go with you.

158
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:20,121
My name is Danny Churchill.
I'm from New York.

159
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,385
Free, white and lonesome.

160
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:26,827
- Danny... Did you say Churchill?
- Churchill Jr., yeah.

161
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:31,159
- The playboy?
- Well, I...

162
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:36,467
- What's so funny?
- Oh, goodness gracious.

163
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:39,035
I don't get it.

164
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,212
Oh, yes, indeed.

165
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,240
Fancy meeting you here?

166
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:50,319
- I don't get it.
- They tell me that you're...

167
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:53,754
That you're quite a hand with the ladies.

168
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,121
I hope I'm as good a hand here
with Hattie.

169
00:14:56,295 --> 00:15:00,356
- As you think you are with the ladies?
- All right. All right.

170
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:46,076
Hey. Hey. How about me?

171
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,678
- Hi. Are you Danny Churchill?
- Yeah.

172
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,009
Well, I'm Henry Lathrop.

173
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,650
- Glad to know you.
- How are you?

174
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:02,218
I'm sorry about jumping over you.
We didn't see you.

175
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:03,514
Well, that's all right.

176
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,317
We'll show you where to register
and the dean's office...

177
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,517
...and the mess hall
and then to your room.

178
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,162
- Swell.
- Come on, let's go.

179
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:17,660
Hi.

180
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:21,067
This is Danny Churchill,
just got in from New York.

181
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,105
This is Bud Livermore,
you're roommate.

182
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:24,537
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hi.

183
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,178
Big day tomorrow.
See you in the morning, about 6:00.

184
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,745
Yeah.

185
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:32,640
Did...? Did he say 6:00?

186
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,482
- When do you sleep?
- We hit the hay pretty early.

187
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:38,748
- At about what time?
- All lights out at 9:30.

188
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:40,585
That's a quaint little hour.

189
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,886
Yeah, and the hay feels pretty good
about then.

190
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,225
- What do you sleep on around here?
- These.

191
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,922
- No mattress?
- Yeah, right here.

192
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,692
You unroll them. I'll show you how.

193
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:52,530
I can see we put them down ourselves
but who puts them up?

194
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,763
You put hooks on the side of the wall...

195
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,340
...and this room can become
a nice little closet.

196
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:58,601
You get used to it.

197
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:01,940
They keep you so busy,
most of the time you don't even notice it.

198
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:04,378
I'm curious.
What does a fellow do around here?

199
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,917
Well, you're up at 5:45.
Roll your cot, clean the room...

200
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,716
...and you're in the mess hall by 6:10.
On the days you don't wait on tables.

201
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:15,155
- Well, how about do you ever...?
- Then you're back in your room at 6:45.

202
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:18,660
- Until 7, your time's your own.
- Well, do you ever get...?

203
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:22,164
Then you go to classes until 10 minutes
of 1, dinner until 1:30.

204
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:24,632
Then you have another 15 minutes
to do anything.

205
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,395
Like playing 18 holes of golf.

206
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:29,040
Then in the afternoon,
you work in the laboratory...

207
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,666
...or in the mine shaft or with the
livestock, depending on your courses.

208
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,176
- Don't you get...?
- Until 5:45.

209
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,280
Then come back to your room
for supper.

210
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,542
After supper, you study till 9:30
and then you go to bed.

211
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:40,912
In a wheelchair, no doubt.

212
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:43,646
- So you see, it's a pretty full day.
- I'd say so.

213
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:46,416
Except Saturday, we have
the afternoon off from 3 till 6.

214
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:47,650
Oh, goody, goody.

215
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:51,023
And at night we see movies,
sometimes talkies.

216
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,664
Talkies?

217
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:57,730
Well, that sort of rounds out
the whole week, doesn't it?

218
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,633
Yeah. I'll go take a shower now
before I do anything else...

219
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,932
I forgot to tell you...

220
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,871
...the showers are out back,
there aren't too many of them.

221
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:07,273
You have to write your name
on a slip of paper...

222
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,209
...and put it in the box in the hall.

223
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,372
The monitor checks it
when you can use them.

224
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,744
The best day is Saturday.

225
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:43,877
Good morning.

226
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,045
Hey, come on.

227
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:52,886
Hey, you gotta get up.

228
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,222
- Up and at them.
- No, no, no.

229
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:58,590
- Come on.
- Look. I'll tell them. I'll tell them.

230
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:02,427
- Fine. When he gets here, I'll tell them.
- Come on. Come on. Up you get.

231
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:07,470
Yeah, 48 states in America and
I have to wake up in a bureau drawer.

232
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,599
- What was that?
- The gong. You get used to it.

233
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,245
- Yeah. Like hanging.
- Come on, will you get up there?

234
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:15,607
- Fine. I'm up.
- Come on.

235
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,944
I jump right out of bed, see?
Okay. Fine.

236
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,653
What, no Indians?

237
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,154
- Hi, you lads.
- Hello, Bud.

238
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:30,818
- How are you?
- How did you sleep?

239
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,964
Sleep? I hardly yawned.

240
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:36,760
Well, wait till you get your lungs full
of some of that good fresh air.

241
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:39,426
- Here you are. Climb into these.
- What are these?

242
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:42,073
We're going on an all-day ride.
Do it every two weeks.

243
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,066
- Well, where to?
- Nowhere in particular.

244
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,439
We ride up into the hills
and spend the night...

245
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,342
...and we come home in the morning.

246
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:53,211
Well, if it's all the same to you fellows,
I think I'll just sit this one out.

247
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:54,511
- No, you don't.
- Come on.

248
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:57,018
Come on, Dan. Come on, Dan.

249
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,915
Come on, fellows, let's go.

250
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,185
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, will you?

251
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:03,885
How do I look?

252
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,620
You look great, old man.

253
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:09,062
Yeah, well, if you bump into
Buffalo Bill, tell him not to worry.

254
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:11,202
That's a good one.

255
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:17,306
Hey, where'd everybody go?

256
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:18,943
Hey, who's riding that buck?

257
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,408
- Good morning.
- Hello, Rags.

258
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,104
- Ain't you coming along?
- As soon as I finish the mail.

259
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,547
Hurry. There's no point to these rides
unless you barbecue them steaks.

260
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,709
I'll be there.
What's holding everything up?

261
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,151
We're waiting for Park Avenue
to mount Whitey.

262
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:37,960
Oh, fine. I gotta see that.

263
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,462
I hope you fellows have a spirited
animal for me...

264
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,396
...because I'm a guy that likes a horse
with plenty of zoom.

265
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:46,128
- I think we can arrange that.
- Well, where is he?

266
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,136
There he is, Whitey.

267
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:53,601
Well, I'll see you later.

268
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:57,545
Why, you'll love Whitey.
He's as meek as a lamb.

269
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,844
Hey, what's that?

270
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,646
The new guy from New York.
He's riding Whitey.

271
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,119
Wait a minute.
You want me to climb up on that?

272
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,485
Why, sure.

273
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,124
All right, boys, let's go.

274
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,715
Whitey.

275
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:41,859
Hey, Whitey.

276
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,736
Whitey, please.

277
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,413
What have I done?

278
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,621
Hi there.

279
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,260
Can I give you a lift?

280
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,797
Anything you could give me
would be an improvement.

281
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:25,966
You're that young fellow
from New York, ain't you?

282
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:28,936
No. No.
I'm that old fellow from New York.

283
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:31,575
- Who are you?
- I'm Rags, New York City.

284
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,438
Checker Cab Company, Class of 1933.

285
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:36,206
Yeah, you haven't got
a checkered cab with you, have you?

286
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:39,373
No, but I got a buckboard.
I can take you up to the camp in that.

287
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:42,247
- What camp?
- With the boys.

288
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,446
Hey, where's Whitey?

289
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,217
Whitey?
Oh, Whitey hit the road.

290
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:49,519
He'll stop when
he gets back to the corral.

291
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:52,891
As far as I'm concerned, he can keep
going until he hits Connecticut.

292
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:56,033
- Well, you ready to ride?
- Yeah.

293
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,567
If I can sit on my stomach.

294
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:02,901
What else do they do around here
besides play cowboys and Indians?

295
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:04,371
The boys work pretty hard...

296
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:07,376
...especially since they threatened
to close the school.

297
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,104
- Yeah? Why?
- I don't know.

298
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,580
Something about the legislature
couldn't get enough unenrollments.

299
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:15,447
If it hadn't been for Armour
and his granddaughter Ginger...

300
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,111
Ginger? Say, is that the girl
that delivers the mail?

301
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,952
That's her. She's coming out
to cook supper for the boys.

302
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,094
Tell me about her, will you?

303
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:26,128
Ain't nothing much to tell
except that she's just wonderful.

304
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:30,462
- Everybody loves her.
- Are you sure it's just everybody?

305
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,695
Yeah. Especially Henry Lathrop.

306
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:37,330
Is he the fellow that goes around
acting like he owns the place?

307
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:38,908
That's him.

308
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:41,511
I knew there was something
about him I didn't like.

309
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:25,884
- Hi, Rags.
- Hey, you lost a tire.

310
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,024
Hey, Danny. Where's Whitey?

311
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,358
Who's that cowboy with you?

312
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:40,701
Did you enjoy the ride?

313
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:44,603
Yeah. I haven't had so much fun
since I was shot out of a cannon.

314
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:05,252
<i>Some fellows like to tiptoe</i>

315
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,593
<i>Through the tulips</i>

316
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,400
<i>Some fellows go on</i>

317
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:17,633
<i>Singing in the rain</i>

318
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:25,742
<i>Some fellows keep on painting skies</i>

319
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,886
<i>With rainbows</i>

320
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:34,015
<i>Some fellows go on swinging</i>

321
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:40,188
<i>Down the lane</i>

322
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,698
<i>But</i>

323
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:48,896
<i>I'm biding my time</i>

324
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:53,670
<i>Because that's the kind of guy I'm</i>

325
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:56,673
<i>While other folks grow dizzy</i>

326
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:59,043
<i>I'll keep busy</i>

327
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:03,813
<i>Biding my time</i>

328
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,423
<i>Next year</i>

329
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:08,889
<i>Next year</i>

330
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:13,690
<i>Something's bound to happen</i>

331
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:16,231
<i>This year</i>

332
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,699
<i>This year</i>

333
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:23,807
<i>I'll just keep on napping</i>

334
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:28,378
<i>I'm biding my time</i>

335
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:33,381
<i>Because that's the kind of guy I'm</i>

336
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:36,019
<i>There's no regretting</i>

337
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:38,451
<i>When I'm setting</i>

338
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:43,822
<i>Biding my time</i>

339
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:05,739
<i>I'm biding my time</i>

340
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:07,976
<i>Biding my time</i>

341
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:12,920
<i>Because that's the kind of guy I'm</i>

342
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:17,653
<i>Beginning on a Monday</i>
<i>Right through Sunday</i>

343
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:23,028
<i>Biding my time</i>

344
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:45,922
- <i>I'm biding my time</i>
- <i>I'm biding, biding</i>

345
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:50,653
<i>Cause that's the kind of guy I'm</i>

346
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,421
<i>That's I'm</i>

347
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,861
<i>Chasing away flies</i>

348
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:57,331
<i>How the day flies</i>

349
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:02,804
<i>Biding, biding my time</i>

350
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:28,123
<i>Yahoo</i>

351
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:31,831
<i>Yahoo</i>

352
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,977
<i>Stranger so long</i>

353
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:27,318
<i>I'll just go along</i>

354
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,086
<i>Biding</i>

355
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:33,389
<i>Biding</i>

356
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:36,830
<i>Biding</i>

357
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:42,906
<i>My time</i>

358
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:48,576
This Western air certainly does
bring out harmony, doesn't it?

359
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,570
It brings out a lot of things.

360
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:51,840
Ginger.

361
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,507
- Yes, Henry.
- You'd better be getting back.

362
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,176
- It's exactly 8:14.
- Yeah.

363
00:30:56,421 --> 00:31:00,517
You know, the astounding thing, that
in exactly 24 hours it'll be 8:14 again.

364
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:04,059
And just think, you'll be the first
to know.

365
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:09,326
Come on, Corky, let's go.
Good night, fellows.

366
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,933
Good night, Ginger.

367
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,261
See you tomorrow.

368
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,833
Come on, fellows, let's turn in.

369
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:23,740
Hey.

370
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:38,954
What's so funny?

371
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:43,260
The strange things you see
when you haven't got a gun.

372
00:31:57,048 --> 00:32:02,418
Me. Me pay you for ride home.

373
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,715
Thank you very much.
The pleasure is all ours.

374
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,381
See you later, buddy. Home.

375
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:21,065
No, sir, it's not like that.
It's not the place.

376
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:23,969
The place is beautiful,
but it just isn't for me.

377
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:27,270
You mean, it's the kind of a school
you'd want to send your son to.

378
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,503
Yes, sir. That's it.

379
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,774
No, I'm sorry. I beg your pardon.
I didn't mean it quite like that.

380
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:36,011
That's all right, Danny, I understand.
It's kind of too bad, though.

381
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:37,677
Pardon me.

382
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:41,347
You know, your grandfather and I
were roommates here.

383
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,759
Hello. Yes.

384
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:46,686
It's the registrar.

385
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:49,298
He wants to know if you're gonna
start classes today.

386
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,456
Well...

387
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:55,470
Hello, Ed. No, he's going back.
Too much fresh air out here.

388
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,108
I don't want you to get
the wrong impression, sir.

389
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:00,369
I have nothing personal
against the school.

390
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:05,107
That's all right, son. I'd probably
be just as unhappy in the Stork Club.

391
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,712
Say, your dad's gonna be
kind of unhappy too, isn't he?

392
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:13,655
Take unhappy and multiply it by furious
and add a little belligerent...

393
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,123
...and I think you've just about got it.

394
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,518
Come in.

395
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:19,890
Gramp, there's a friend of yours outside.

396
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:23,830
The maybe-maybe girl from
never-never land, Ms. Polly Williams.

397
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:28,132
Hi, Grampo. Here I am C.o. D., F.o. B.,
and M.U.G.

398
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:29,898
Come on, honey, hang one on.

399
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:33,738
- There. That didn't hurt a bit, did it?
- Polly, I'm glad to see you.

400
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:37,642
I'm glad you said, "I'm glad to see you,"
because I'm glad you're glad to see me.

401
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:39,373
- Hi, neighbor.
- Excuse me, Danny.

402
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,815
- This is my grandchild. Ms. Ginger Gray.
- Yes, we've met before.

403
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:45,285
Yes. And this is my cousin
Ms. Polly Williams.

404
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:47,390
Mr. Daniel Churchill, Jr.

405
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,650
Hi, Church. How's your steeple?

406
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:52,989
Say, you know, junior, you're cute.

407
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:54,825
- Well, I...
- That's all right, junior.

408
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:57,695
I know just how you feel.

409
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,765
Here's some mail for you, Mr. Churchill.

410
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:04,767
Channel number five.

411
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:07,000
There's something loose in here.

412
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:11,239
Well, I think I'd better get going
so I don't miss my train.

413
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:14,817
Danny, Ginger's having a big birthday
party tonight. You better stay over.

414
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:17,580
I'd like to very much,
but I've already wired my father.

415
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:19,950
You're missing some mighty fine
singing.

416
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:22,092
Yes, sir.
Ginger's got plenty of snap.

417
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,490
I'm sure Mr. Churchill would find it
rather dull.

418
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:26,892
Would you like me to drive you
to the junction?

419
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,054
I don't...

420
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,962
It will be a pleasure.
I don't want you to miss that train.

421
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:32,966
- Thank you very much.
- Don't mention it.

422
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:34,229
It's very nice of you...

423
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,771
So long, junior.
See you in the pool room.

424
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:38,841
Just ask for Polly.

425
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:42,275
So long, Polly. Watch your crackers.

426
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:50,749
Nice day, isn't it?

427
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,917
Nice day yesterday.

428
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,586
What do you think the chances are
for tomorrow?

429
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:03,158
Say, you by any chance aren't related
to Harpo Marx, are you?

430
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:09,401
There's something I have to tell you.

431
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:11,701
And if I don't tell you,
I'm gonna hate myself.

432
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:13,776
I'll bet you'd be the only one.

433
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:18,441
You are the most precocious,
overconfident, spoiled young man...

434
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,084
...I've ever had the misfortune to meet.

435
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:24,949
- I think you're cute too.
- As an added attraction, you're a quitter.

436
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,683
Why, you've been eating ice cream
with a silver spoon...

437
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:31,056
...in a nice fat college for a long time
that when you get out here...

438
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,220
...with plain people, you run for cover.

439
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:35,058
Wait a minute. Now it's my turn.

440
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,258
Did anyone tell you
that you've got a face...

441
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:39,494
...like a two-week vacation with pay?

442
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,932
Did anyone ever tell you...

443
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,699
...you've got a nose cute enough
to write a song about?

444
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:47,641
Did anyone tell you when a girl like you
starts talking about a fellow like me...

445
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:51,077
...it means only one thing, that
you're falling madly in love with him?

446
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:54,047
Did anyone ever tell you
that a fellow in my state of mind...

447
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:57,346
...is apt to kiss a girl
in your state of mind?

448
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,818
- I dare you.
- You what?

449
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,053
- I double-dare you.
- Double?

450
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:07,660
- You did it.
- I did?

451
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,460
Why, it's funny.
I didn't even notice it.

452
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:38,318
<i>Have some pity on an Easterner</i>

453
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:41,556
<i>Show a little sympathy</i>

454
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:44,667
<i>No one possibly could be sterner</i>

455
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:48,202
<i>Than you have been with me</i>

456
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:51,802
<i>Now, there's a job that I'm applying for</i>

457
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:55,139
<i>Let me put it to you thus</i>

458
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:58,212
<i>It's a partnership I'm dying for</i>

459
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:01,351
<i>Mr. And Mrs. Us</i>

460
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:05,546
<i>Now, before you file it on the shelf</i>

461
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:10,683
<i>Let me tell you of myself</i>

462
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:16,390
<i>Oh, I'm the chappie to make you happy</i>

463
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:20,128
<i>I'll tie your shoesies</i>
<i>And chase your bluesies</i>

464
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:21,771
<i>Oh, lady, would you?</i>

465
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:26,706
<i>Oh, lady, could you use me?</i>

466
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:30,005
<i>Now, I'd shake the mat out</i>
<i>And put the cat out</i>

467
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:33,378
<i>I'd clean the garret and feed the parrot</i>

468
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:35,178
<i>Oh, lady, would you?</i>

469
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:39,119
<i>Oh, tell me. Could you use me?</i>

470
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:43,757
<i>Oh, do you realize what a good man</i>

471
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:47,386
<i>You're getting in me</i>

472
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:50,966
<i>I'm no Elk or Mason or Woodman</i>

473
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:53,968
<i>Who gets home at 3</i>

474
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:57,905
<i>The girls who see me</i>
<i>Grow soft and dreamy</i>

475
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:01,238
<i>But I'm a gander who won't philander</i>

476
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:03,710
<i>Oh, could you use me?</i>

477
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:09,877
<i>Because I certainly could use you</i>

478
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:19,961
<i>There's a chap I know in Mexico</i>

479
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:23,658
<i>Who's as strong as he can be</i>

480
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:27,235
<i>Eating nails and drinking Texaco</i>

481
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:31,239
<i>He is the type for me</i>

482
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:35,777
<i>There is one in California</i>

483
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:39,382
<i>More romantic far than you</i>

484
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,781
<i>When he sings "Ha-cha-cha-chornia"</i>

485
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:46,980
<i>I often think he'll do</i>

486
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,683
<i>But as for you, sir</i>

487
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:55,856
<i>I'm afraid you will never make</i>

488
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:59,628
<i>The grade</i>

489
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:04,798
<i>For you're no cowboy</i>
<i>You're soft and how, boy</i>

490
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:08,103
<i>I feel no muscle that's fit for tussle</i>

491
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:13,444
<i>I must refuse you</i>
<i>I cannot use you, excuse me</i>

492
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:18,480
<i>No night life for you</i>
<i>The birds would bore you</i>

493
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:21,716
<i>The cows won't know you</i>
<i>A horse would throw you</i>

494
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:27,330
<i>You silly man, you</i>
<i>To ask me, can you use me?</i>

495
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:31,731
<i>Though at love you may be a wizard</i>

496
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:35,998
<i>I'm wanting to know</i>

497
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:39,142
<i>Could you warm me up in a blizzard</i>

498
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:42,837
<i>Say, 40 below</i>

499
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:46,847
<i>Your ties are freakish</i>
<i>Your knees are weakish</i>

500
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:50,350
<i>You're not a spender, you elbow-bender</i>

501
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,682
<i>Though you can use me</i>

502
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:58,727
<i>I most certainly can't use you</i>

503
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:17,279
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

504
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:21,179
<i>Happy birthday, dear Ginger</i>

505
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:26,153
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

506
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:31,358
<i>A happy birthday to you</i>
<i>A happy birthday to you</i>

507
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:34,760
<i>A happy birthday, Miss Ginger</i>

508
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:40,370
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

509
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,130
oh, thank you.

510
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:44,399
- Make a wish.
- Come on, Ginger, make a wish.

511
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:45,872
All right.

512
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:50,275
- One.
- Two, three.

513
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:57,848
Come on. Come this way.

514
00:40:58,022 --> 00:40:59,546
Here it is.

515
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,528
Here it is.

516
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:06,526
For you, Miss Ginger.

517
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,862
"To Ginger, from all her fellows. "

518
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:10,796
- And that includes me.
- Go on, pull it.

519
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,629
- What, this?
- Sure. See what's in it.

520
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,236
All right.

521
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:20,599
Oh, it's beautiful.

522
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:23,508
Go on. Play something, Ginger.

523
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,581
And it plays.

524
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:39,294
<i>Dozens of boys would storm up</i>

525
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:43,229
<i>I had to lock my door</i>

526
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,699
<i>Somehow I wouldn't warm up</i>

527
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:50,967
<i>To one before</i>

528
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:54,668
<i>What was it that controlled me?</i>

529
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:58,246
<i>What kept my love-life lean?</i>

530
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:01,384
<i>My intuition told me</i>

531
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:06,148
<i>You'd come on the scene</i>

532
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:10,191
<i>If you'll listen to the rhythm</i>
<i>Of my heartbeat</i>

533
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,760
<i>You will get</i>

534
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:17,868
<i>Just what I mean</i>

535
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:21,228
<i>Embrace me</i>

536
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:26,638
<i>My sweet embraceable you</i>

537
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,937
<i>Embrace me</i>

538
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:33,880
<i>You irreplaceable you</i>

539
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,781
<i>Just one look at you</i>

540
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:41,288
<i>My heart grew tipsy in me</i>

541
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:44,154
<i>You and you alone</i>

542
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:49,459
<i>Bring out the gypsy in me</i>

543
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:53,967
<i>I love all the many charms</i>

544
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:57,107
<i>About you</i>

545
00:42:57,274 --> 00:42:59,208
<i>Above all</i>

546
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:04,678
<i>I want my arms about you</i>

547
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:08,944
<i>Don't be a naughty papa</i>

548
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,281
<i>Come to baby</i>

549
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:16,950
<i>Come to baby, do</i>

550
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:19,289
<i>My sweet</i>

551
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:24,457
<i>Embraceable</i>

552
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:26,899
- <i>You</i>
- <i>Embrace me</i>

553
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:32,304
<i>My sweet embraceable you</i>

554
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:34,239
<i>Embrace me</i>

555
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:39,246
<i>You irreplaceable you</i>

556
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:40,542
<i>In your arms</i>

557
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:44,711
<i>I find love so delectable, dear</i>

558
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:46,583
<i>Doo-doo-doo</i>

559
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:47,917
<i>I'm afraid</i>

560
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:53,530
<i>It isn't quite respectable, dear</i>

561
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:55,255
<i>But hang it</i>

562
00:43:55,432 --> 00:44:00,495
<i>Come on, let's glorify love</i>

563
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:02,332
<i>Ding-dang it</i>

564
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:07,569
<i>You'll shout encore if I love</i>

565
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:10,976
<i>Don't be a naughty baby</i>

566
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:14,584
<i>Come to papa, come to papa, do</i>

567
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:19,849
<i>My sweet embraceable</i>

568
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:23,357
<i>You</i>

569
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:13,971
<i>My sweet embraceable</i>

570
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:17,341
<i>You</i>

571
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:48,509
<i>I love all the many charms</i>

572
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:51,648
<i>About you</i>

573
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:53,339
<i>Above all</i>

574
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:58,318
<i>I want my arms about you</i>

575
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:01,886
<i>Don't be a naughty baby</i>

576
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:03,684
- <i>Come to Tommy</i>
- <i>Come to Georgie</i>

577
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:05,351
- <i>Come to Harry</i>
- <i>Come to Johnny</i>

578
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:08,930
- <i>Come to Bobby</i>
- <i>Come to baby, do</i>

579
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:14,401
<i>My sweet embraceable</i>

580
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:19,804
<i>You</i>

581
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:27,081
Henry, do you think
the night is this beautiful...

582
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:29,242
...just because it's my birthday?

583
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:32,320
Oh, I don't know. I'd say it was
more or less of a coincidence.

584
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:34,354
Oh, you would?

585
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:37,253
- Ginger.
- Yes, Henry?

586
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:40,919
- Ginger, I'm a man of few words and...
- Yes, Henry?

587
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:45,364
Well, after approaching the subject
from every standpoint very objectively...

588
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:50,166
...I think it would be to our mutual
advantage if we became engaged.

589
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:54,033
- Engaged?
- Yes.

590
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:58,614
And after a respectable period of time,
I think we should be married.

591
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:02,146
Henry, this is so sudden.

592
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,618
Well, you know I like to put my cards
on the table.

593
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:09,054
Yes, well, I think you could
have taken out the joker.

594
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,288
Well?

595
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:14,294
- Well, what?
- Well, I'm waiting for an answer.

596
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:17,729
- Well, that's pretty complicated.
- It's really quite simple.

597
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:23,840
You're young, attractive, intelligent
and I'm young and intelligent.

598
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,907
And all we need is a meeting
of the minds.

599
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:29,777
Meeting of the minds?

600
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,981
Look, Henry, I think you're
an awfully nice boy...

601
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,777
...and I'm very fond of you.

602
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:37,352
But you just don't ask a girl
to marry you...

603
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,354
...like going to the hardware store
to buy a coffee grinder.

604
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,151
You don't come up
to a girl and say:

605
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:45,386
"The humidity's high for this time
of year. Will you marry me?"

606
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:49,692
Well, I just didn't want to get romantic.

607
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:55,169
You just didn't want to get romantic.
What are you saving it for?

608
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,531
I thought we were above
that sort of thing.

609
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:03,440
Well, Henry, maybe you are.
I hope I'm not.

610
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:06,911
Very well, Ginger, I'm not discouraged.
Shall we go back?

611
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:09,450
No, you go ahead.

612
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,714
I'm going to stay out here
and just look at everything.

613
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,187
As you wish.

614
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:49,383
What are you doing here?

615
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:53,461
I just got to thinking
about what you said in the car...

616
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:55,894
...and I got to thinking
that you were right.

617
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:58,864
Besides, I heard you were getting
married...

618
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:01,470
...so I came back to offer my services.

619
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:04,334
- In what capacity?
- Best man.

620
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:06,237
Well, I'm not getting married.

621
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:07,707
I didn't think so.

622
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:09,505
I just said, I didn't think so.

623
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,547
Oh, you didn't think so.
Have you been listening all the time?

624
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:15,947
No, really, I was trapped there.

625
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:18,386
He certainly does pack a terrific wallop.

626
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:21,524
- Who?
- Mr. Put-Your-Cards-on-the-Table.

627
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:22,818
He's a very nice fellow.

628
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:26,292
Yes, he's a very nice fellow.

629
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,658
Just the guy to get
Juliet off the balcony.

630
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:31,300
Well, there are other things
besides making love.

631
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,766
Wait a minute. Don't start knocking that.

632
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:37,164
Are you going to be staying...

633
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:38,968
...around?

634
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,541
Yes.

635
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:43,703
I'm going to be staying... around.

636
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,745
I thought you hated it here?

637
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,610
Not anymore.

638
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:51,310
Well, what made you decide to stay...

639
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:52,955
...around?

640
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:55,057
Well, it could be the climate...

641
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:58,058
...around, but it isn't.

642
00:49:58,228 --> 00:50:01,163
Or it could be my love
for the great open spaces...

643
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,491
...but it isn't.

644
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:05,392
And again,
it could be that I just like you.

645
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:08,901
Yeah. Yeah, it could be.

646
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:13,933
- Were you always out of your mind?
- No, no, no, just lately.

647
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:16,443
And gosh, it's wonderful.

648
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:22,018
- I think I'd better get back to the party.
- Oh, wait a minute.

649
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:25,586
- Here, I've got a present for you.
- For me?

650
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:28,884
Sure. My grandmother gave it
to my father, and he gave it to me.

651
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:30,424
It's lucky.

652
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:33,654
It's beautiful. My.

653
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,631
That's me, before and after.

654
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,667
- You haven't changed much.
- Only I dress better now.

655
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:41,736
I can't take it if it's your lucky piece.

656
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:43,998
No, go ahead and keep it.
I won't need it now.

657
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:46,142
Now that you're around.

658
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:51,371
Gosh, first a piano and now this.
It's quite a birthday.

659
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,379
Would you do something for me?

660
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:59,185
Well, remember the kiss
that I gave you this afternoon?

661
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:03,586
Would you mind giving it back to me?

662
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,163
Oh, well, if that's the way
you feel about it.

663
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:13,700
- Happy birthday.
- What?

664
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:15,735
Happy birth...

665
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:26,275
Come in.

666
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:29,113
- Hi, Rags.
- Hi, Mr. Churchill.

667
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:32,653
- How are you feeling?
- Well, great, as long as I don't sit down.

668
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:35,553
Mr. Churchill, I knew you wasn't
gonna walk out on us.

669
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:36,749
You did? How?

670
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:39,623
I wasn't one of those taxi jockeys
in New York for nothing.

671
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:43,061
You ain't the kind that'll hop out
of a cab in the middle of traffic...

672
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:45,030
...just because the meter's gonna jump.

673
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:46,191
Thanks, Rags.

674
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:48,269
- Will you do something for me?
- Anything.

675
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,406
- Will you send this telegram for me?
- Sure.

676
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:52,371
I'll phone it in from
the post exchange.

677
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:54,442
Thanks. Here's something
for your trouble.

678
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,078
- No, that's all right.
- Why not?

679
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:57,770
Oh, no, I never touch the stuff.

680
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,745
Money's just like women and popcorn...

681
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:01,816
...the more you get the more you want.

682
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:04,453
I ain't had change
for a quarter in 10 years...

683
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,612
...and, boy, am I a happy guy.

684
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:11,956
- Hello, Rags. How are you?
- Mr. Lathrop.

685
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,960
- Would you do me a favor, please?
- Sure.

686
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:18,693
- Send this before the station closes.
- Well, there's the telephone right there.

687
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:22,697
Well, I can't go around
reading other people's mail.

688
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:27,967
Have a sandwich?

689
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,306
Oh, no, thanks.
Had too much birthday cake.

690
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,107
"Mr. Daniel Churchill Sr.

691
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:36,048
New York Union,
Times Square, New York City.

692
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:39,245
Dear Dad, have changed my mind. " Stop.

693
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:41,583
"Am not leaving Cody. " Stop.

694
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:45,159
"This school has as much personality
as a cup of cold cocoa...

695
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:48,058
...and I still think
the place is pretty snerpy. "

696
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:51,223
- Excuse me, I made a...
- Go ahead, Tom.

697
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:53,699
"And the students here play
cowboys and Indians...

698
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:56,464
...but you know a Churchill never quits. "
Stop.

699
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,269
"There's something about this place
that fills a fellow with plenty of ginger. "

700
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:03,310
Stop. "I would appreciate check
by Pony Express.

701
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,711
Love, Danny Boy. " Thanks, Ed.

702
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:09,147
Cowboys and Indians?
Come on, fellows.

703
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:12,417
- What's going on, Henry?
- I'm calling a mass meeting tonight.

704
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:13,578
What for?

705
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:16,225
To discuss the dismissal
of Danny Churchill Jr.

706
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:20,022
- Why?
- Read the telegram he sent his father.

707
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:23,826
"Dear Dad, changed my mind.
Am not leaving Cody. "

708
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,763
Danny Churchill or no Danny Churchill?

709
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:27,870
He won't change the school to his liking.

710
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,233
The student council will take care
of this.

711
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:32,102
Come on.

712
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:43,452
- Did you put this up on the board?
- I did.

713
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,417
I think you and I better step outside.

714
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:50,322
You know, this Western air fools you.
It makes you feel extra brave.

715
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:52,393
All right, so you're taller than I am.

716
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,359
- I think that we'd...
- No, I'm all right.

717
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:56,556
- I can take care of myself.
- Well, all right.

718
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:59,463
Why, Henry here is the boxing champ
of the school.

719
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:01,228
Do you want to step outside or not?

720
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:04,305
Mr. Churchill, Mr. Lathrop, the dean
wants you in the office.

721
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:07,841
- Do you know what he wants?
- No, I don't, but he's steaming.

722
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:10,509
- Good day.
- How are you, sir?

723
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,204
Little excitement going on here?

724
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:14,407
- Yes, sir.
- What seems to be the trouble?

725
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:15,573
- It seems...
- We found...

726
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:16,980
From left to right, please.

727
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:20,247
- It's about this telegram.
- I've been informed of its contents.

728
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,391
This is my fault.
Those are my sentiments.

729
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,754
I'm sorry I feel the way I do, but I do.

730
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,260
I feel as though I've caused enough
trouble here.

731
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,660
I think the best thing for me to do
is resign.

732
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:32,233
Young man, you are the resign-est
fellow I ever saw.

733
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:34,563
- Yes, sir.
- All you've done since you arrived...

734
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:37,332
...was unpack, pack and resign.
- Yes, sir.

735
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:39,805
- Would you tell me something?
- Yes, sir.

736
00:54:39,976 --> 00:54:43,241
Just what is the meaning
of the word "snerpy"?

737
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,514
Well... Well, a snerp...

738
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:50,483
...is a looging with a belt in the back.
Sometimes referred to as a diljo.

739
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:53,555
- A diljo is a...
- Never mind. I have a rough idea.

740
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:55,281
- Henry Lathrop.
- Yes, sir?

741
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,619
What prompted you put that notice
on the board?

742
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:00,092
- The student council had a meeting...
- A meeting?

743
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:02,663
Every time a cow coughs,
that council has a meeting.

744
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:03,890
Where's my glass?

745
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:07,763
We felt if that was Mr. Churchill's
opinion, he didn't belong here.

746
00:55:07,937 --> 00:55:10,269
You did? If you'd been minding
your own business...

747
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,409
...you wouldn't know what people are
saying in private telegrams.

748
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:16,340
If you didn't know that,
there wouldn't have been a meeting.

749
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:18,071
- Sir, we were only...
- Would there?

750
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:20,011
- No.
- Supposing we forget all about it.

751
00:55:20,183 --> 00:55:22,743
- But the student council...
- Hoot on the student council.

752
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:24,181
There's my glass.

753
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:26,379
- Lf this young man thinks we're a...
- A diljo?

754
00:55:26,556 --> 00:55:28,421
A diljo, that's his privilege.

755
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:30,855
- We're still in America, aren't we?
- Yes, sir.

756
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:33,723
Well, that gives him a right
to call us a diljo.

757
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:38,231
As for you, supposing you stop
unpacking, packing and resigning...

758
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:40,631
...and start learning something
around here?

759
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:42,328
Yes, sir.

760
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,666
Well, get going, both of you.

761
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:47,872
Oh, just a minute.

762
00:55:48,478 --> 00:55:50,708
There's another American custom.

763
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:57,385
Well, don't stand there like
Ike and Mike, scoot.

764
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:00,582
- Hi, boys.
- Hi, dean.

765
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:02,657
Hello, Gramps.

766
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:05,886
Ginger, have we a slang dictionary?

767
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:08,053
What's your problem?
What word do you want?

768
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:09,664
Looging.

769
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:11,664
- Looging?
- With a belt in the back.

770
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:13,268
<i>Flash. The legislature today... </i>

771
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:15,700
<i>... in conjunction with</i>
<i>the new education bill... </i>

772
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,238
<i>... has ordered Cody College</i>
<i>to be closed next year. </i>

773
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:19,773
<i>Reason given by legislature:</i>

774
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:22,639
<i>Applications for enrollment</i>
<i>have fallen off to an extent... </i>

775
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:25,144
<i>... that they decided</i>
<i>to withdraw school's charter. </i>

776
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:27,749
<i>The bill awaits Governor Tait's</i>
<i>signature. </i>

777
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:29,441
What does that mean?

778
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:31,610
The school closes.

779
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:34,154
Well, that's impossible.

780
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:37,259
- Did you know about it?
- Yes.

781
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:38,985
Well, they can't do that.

782
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:41,630
- Let's do something about it.
- I've done all I could.

783
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:43,265
- Lf he signs that...
- Don't worry.

784
00:56:43,433 --> 00:56:45,264
After all these years...

785
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:47,493
Gramp.

786
00:56:48,204 --> 00:56:49,728
Well, I just can't stand here.

787
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:52,067
I better call a meeting,
tell them about it.

788
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,233
What will you do if you lose
the school?

789
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:57,642
Oh, I'll find some other kind
of business, I reckon.

790
00:56:58,281 --> 00:57:01,739
I'm getting kind of tired of the boys,
anyhow.

791
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:25,103
- Hi there.
- Hello.

792
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,572
Any mail for me?

793
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:28,711
No, not today.

794
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:34,214
Ginger, about forwarding my mail...

795
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:39,019
Here. You can fill that out.

796
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:43,617
Well, I guess now that the college
is closing, all your problems are settled.

797
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:46,393
Look, Ginger, I'm not gonna be
a hypocrite and say:

798
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:48,827
"I'm sorry the place is closing,"
because I'm not.

799
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:51,523
But I am sorry about leaving you.

800
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:56,671
Hey, come on.
Things aren't really that bad.

801
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:01,243
I'm sorry, but poor Gramp.

802
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:03,606
All his life,
he worked so hard for the place.

803
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,874
Why, every boy that came in there
was just like his own.

804
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:08,677
Here, blow.

805
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:10,581
Blow. Blow.

806
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:14,983
Ginger,
I'm not going back to New York.

807
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,183
- You're not?
- No, I'm gonna stay right here.

808
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,521
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not getting sentimental.

809
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:22,290
I don't care about the school.
As far as I'm concerned...

810
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:24,865
...it's just a place to look at
from an upper berth.

811
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:28,197
But, well, I...
I do care about you.

812
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:33,642
- You do?
- Yes, I do.

813
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:36,404
What they need here's a less cheering
and more operation.

814
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:37,568
You bet.

815
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:40,739
Let's go to the dean's. We'll give him
something to cheer about.

816
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:42,680
- All right.
- Are you through with that?

817
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:45,446
- Yeah.
- Thanks. Come on.

818
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:48,022
- May we ask you a question, please?
- Why, certainly.

819
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:51,160
How many applications do you need
for next year's freshman class?

820
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:52,316
Oh, about 125.

821
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:55,896
You mean if 125 applied for admission,
that you'd get the appropriation?

822
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:57,999
- That's right.
- It's very simple.

823
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:00,829
What made Dartmouth famous?
The Dartmouth Winter Carnival.

824
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:02,801
What put Southern California
on the map?

825
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:03,961
The Rose Bowl.

826
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:05,869
What made Notre Dame
a household word?

827
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,066
Football teams.

828
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:09,939
Every college in the country
was made famous by some event.

829
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:11,910
What's the springboard
for Cody College?

830
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:14,606
A Western rodeo.
Once a year we'll bring back the West.

831
00:59:14,784 --> 00:59:16,809
- Daniel Boone.
- Jesse James and Buffalo Bill.

832
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:18,419
- Beautiful girls.
- On horseback.

833
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:21,022
- Glorious costumes. Happy. Carefree.
- Gay.

834
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:23,624
Once a year,
we'll choose the most beautiful girl.

835
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:25,385
We'll make her Queen of the Rodeo.

836
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,759
Sure. Little kids will be begging
their mothers to send them out here.

837
00:59:28,932 --> 00:59:30,194
Well, it's fantastic.

838
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:32,732
All we want is your permission
to see the governor.

839
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:37,032
Well, I've lived through three blizzards,
an epidemic and four wars in my time.

840
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:39,367
I guess I could stand
a hundred beautiful girls.

841
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:41,601
- On horseback.
- On horseback.

842
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:45,407
Danny, I give you the governor.

843
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:58,318
Hey. Hey. Egghead.

844
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:01,622
- Ma'am.
- You took the wrong road.

845
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:03,689
So I did.

846
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:17,308
Yes, I'll call you as soon as I can make
an appointment with the governor.

847
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:20,478
Not at all. Thank you.

848
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:23,478
"Governor's daughter
makes debut tonight.

849
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:27,111
Marjorie Tait, season's popular deb,
official hostess at inaugural ball. "

850
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:30,657
- She's a pretty girl.
- Domestic, isn't she?

851
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:32,556
What time is it?

852
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,427
Four o'clock.

853
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,830
- Excuse me, sir, but don't you...
- I'm sorry...

854
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:42,733
...but the governor is still busy
with a special committee.

855
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:46,705
And besides, he's seeing no one today
except by appointment.

856
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:49,037
Not even a Republican?

857
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:54,573
What are we gonna do?

858
01:00:58,287 --> 01:01:00,687
Stand up, Ginger, and let me...
Let me see that dress.

859
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:02,984
Will you? For a minute, please?

860
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:06,660
Stand up and let me...
Let me see your dress.

861
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:11,962
My, my.

862
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:15,132
It's awfully pretty. Blue is nice on you.

863
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:18,000
Yes, sir. Very, very pretty.

864
01:01:20,043 --> 01:01:21,772
Yes, you...

865
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:26,140
...certainly, certainly look nice.

866
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:28,249
What'd you write on that...?

867
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:32,684
Would you take this into the governor?
I hate to bother you like this.

868
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:35,551
"Dear Bill, in town for the day.
Could you see me a minute?

869
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:36,953
Regards, Dan. "

870
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:39,151
Now, young fellow,
we can't have any of that.

871
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:41,421
Please, take it in. I'll bet he'll see me.

872
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:43,690
- What are you trying to do, get me fired?
- No.

873
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:47,563
- The governor has a broadcast here...
- Please, if he doesn't see us, we'll leave.

874
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:49,261
- Yeah.
- Well, all right.

875
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:51,698
- Can we leave the equipment here?
- Yes.

876
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:54,342
The room we'll use for the broadcast
is down the hall.

877
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:56,478
I'll show it to you.

878
01:01:57,847 --> 01:02:00,475
I don't think we're gonna get to see him.

879
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:03,175
Oh, sure we will.

880
01:02:12,128 --> 01:02:13,561
Here we are at Forest Hills...

881
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:17,291
...bringing you the tennis matches
between Covas and Lopez from Mexico.

882
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:20,630
Miss Covas is about to serve.
It's an excellent serve, cross-handed.

883
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:23,465
Back-handed cross-court.
Miss Covas outside.

884
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:27,541
It's 40-love, match point.
Miss Lopez is about to serve now.

885
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:29,974
She asked that everybody in the gallery
be silent.

886
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:32,614
It's an excellent serve.
It's cross-courted back-hand.

887
01:02:32,782 --> 01:02:34,579
There's a volley.

888
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:39,752
Out.

889
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:46,228
We're about to bring you the main
event between champion Joe Louis...

890
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:48,192
...and the contender, Johnny Paycheck.

891
01:02:48,364 --> 01:02:50,559
As yet, both boys have not come
into the ring...

892
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:52,701
...but we expect them at any moment.

893
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:55,838
And here's Harry Bellows
announcing in the center of the ring.

894
01:02:56,005 --> 01:02:58,803
Introducing the main contestants
of the evening...

895
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:00,169
...15 rounds of boxing...

896
01:03:00,343 --> 01:03:02,709
...for the heavyweight championship
of the world...

897
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:06,406
...from Des Moines, Iowa,
weighing 187 and a quarter pounds...

898
01:03:06,582 --> 01:03:08,743
...wearing black trunks,
Johnny Paycheck.

899
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:11,478
Stand up, Paycheck. Take a bow.
Okay, okay.

900
01:03:11,654 --> 01:03:15,647
And his worthy opponent, considered
the greatest heavyweight of all times...

901
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:18,726
...from Detroit, weighing 202
and a quarter pounds...

902
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:21,489
...wearing purple tights, Joe Louis.

903
01:03:21,664 --> 01:03:23,222
Stand up, Louis, take a bow.

904
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:26,926
Hello, Joe. Here's the bell for round one
and your announcer, Clem McCarthy.

905
01:03:27,103 --> 01:03:30,231
Good evening, thanks very much.
Louis stalks him with a left hand.

906
01:03:30,406 --> 01:03:33,432
It's the same old Joe Louis
that we've seen time and time again.

907
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:36,407
He tries with a left hand to the body.
Paycheck bounced away.

908
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:39,605
He didn't like the blow at all.
Louis caught him with a left hand.

909
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:41,977
Paycheck is down.
The count is one, two, three.

910
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:44,278
Ladies and gentlemen,
referee Arthur Donovan...

911
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:47,422
...has stopped the bout
and it's Louis, by a knockout.

912
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:50,684
Stick around. We'll try and get
a few words from the champion.

913
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:53,693
Pardon us. Can we get through?
Hey, Joe. Joe, Joe, Joe.

914
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:55,694
Ladies and gentlemen,
here's Joe Louis.

915
01:03:55,865 --> 01:03:58,060
Tell us about the fight
as long as it lasted.

916
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:01,260
Joe, did he hurt you in the first round?
Joe Louis.

917
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:03,598
Thank you very, very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

918
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:08,267
It was a tough fight. If I fight him again
maybe I'll still keep the championship.

919
01:04:08,644 --> 01:04:11,807
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.

920
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:15,144
Well, don't you think you better stop
shrieking with laughter?

921
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:16,546
I don't feel like laughing.

922
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:18,983
You're getting to be
a regular problem child.

923
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:22,488
Even worse than that kid I used to
know, the kid with the electric leg.

924
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:24,922
- Electric leg?
- Yeah.

925
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:27,221
A fellow I know stepped on
a high-tension wire.

926
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:31,355
Oh, we saved his life, but from then on,
his leg was always magnetized.

927
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:33,399
What? Is he all right now?

928
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:35,901
I don't know.
I haven't seen him lately.

929
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:38,973
But you shouldn't let a situation
like this aggravate you.

930
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:42,633
After all,
worrying never solved anything.

931
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:45,847
Remember what Shakespeare once said:

932
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:48,415
"He jests at scars that never
felt a wound.

933
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:53,381
But, soft! What light through
yonder window breaks?

934
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:57,083
'Tis the east and Juliet is the sun. "

935
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:01,628
Do you really think
we'll get to see the governor?

936
01:05:01,797 --> 01:05:03,788
I take an oath.

937
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:09,361
- What if he turns us down?
- Oh, he hasn't got a leg to stand on.

938
01:05:09,805 --> 01:05:11,932
And neither have I.

939
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:15,506
Now we present George Armour Allan,
and the news.

940
01:05:15,878 --> 01:05:18,506
Take it away, New York.

941
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:31,192
Mr. Churchill.

942
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:33,223
Mr. Churchill?

943
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:34,420
Oh, excuse me.

944
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:36,326
The governor will see you
immediately.

945
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:38,967
- This way, please.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you, sir.

946
01:05:39,135 --> 01:05:40,966
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- Yes.

947
01:05:41,137 --> 01:05:43,401
- Remember our bet.
- Hurry up. Hurry up.

948
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:49,068
Mr. Churchill.

949
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:51,645
Well, it's certainly good...

950
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:56,417
Why, what is it, young man?

951
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:01,951
Well, what can I do for you, son?

952
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:05,927
Well, who are you?
What's your name?

953
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:09,995
Really now...

954
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:12,134
Mr. Governor,
my name is Ginger Gray...

955
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:14,929
...and this quiet fellow here
is Danny Churchill.

956
01:06:15,571 --> 01:06:16,629
Dan Churchill?

957
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:18,933
- That's impossible. L...
- Junior.

958
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:20,234
Junior.

959
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:23,435
- Are you Dan Churchill's son?
- Yes.

960
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:25,170
- Yes, sir.
- Hello, Dan.

961
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:26,576
- How's your dad?
- Well...

962
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:28,614
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

963
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:31,551
What's on your mind?

964
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:34,246
This is Ginger.
She's the granddaughter of Dean Armour.

965
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:36,015
Dean Armour? Really?

966
01:06:36,192 --> 01:06:37,591
I talked to him on the phone.

967
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,625
I know. That's why we came to see you.

968
01:06:39,795 --> 01:06:40,989
I'm a student there.

969
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:43,028
You are? I didn't know that.

970
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:45,861
I am. Mr. Governor,
you can't close down that college.

971
01:06:46,035 --> 01:06:49,698
I'm afraid I have nothing to do with it.
The legislature passed the bill.

972
01:06:49,872 --> 01:06:52,432
I know, but the bill's no good
unless you sign it.

973
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:56,135
I know, Ms. Gray, but I have to sign it,
I'm afraid.

974
01:06:56,312 --> 01:06:59,577
Suppose you gave us more time.
Suppose a lot of applications came in...

975
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:03,344
...then you won't have to sign the bill?
- But what makes you think they will?

976
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:06,784
I have a feeling a lot of boys will
wanna go to Cody College next year.

977
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:09,220
- Yes, sir.
- Just what do you me want to do?

978
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:10,518
- Give us 30 days.
- Yeah.

979
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:15,153
And if nothing happens within that time,
then go ahead and sign the bill, sir.

980
01:07:16,432 --> 01:07:18,457
I'm a reasonable man.

981
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:19,760
All right.

982
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:22,301
- There you go.
- Thank you.

983
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:25,463
I won't even ask
how it's going to be done.

984
01:07:27,143 --> 01:07:29,077
<i>You're on the air in five minutes, sir. </i>

985
01:07:29,245 --> 01:07:31,179
Sorry, I have to run.

986
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:34,009
My daughter's giving a big party.
Would you like to come?

987
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:36,310
I can't.
I have to get back, but Danny can go.

988
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:40,717
Oh, well, thanks very much
but all I have is this pinstripe suit.

989
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,687
- Wish I could wear one.
- You go ahead.

990
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:44,826
- I don't really feel as though I...
- Go on.

991
01:07:44,994 --> 01:07:46,120
You know. Go on.

992
01:07:46,295 --> 01:07:49,423
- All right. Thank you, sir, very much.
- Fine.

993
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:52,032
- Say hello to your grandfather.
- I will, thank you.

994
01:07:52,201 --> 01:07:54,533
- I'll see you later.
- All right, sir. Goodbye.

995
01:07:54,703 --> 01:07:55,727
Danny.

996
01:07:56,939 --> 01:07:59,737
- For you, John.
- Thank you, sir.

997
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:06,213
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

998
01:08:06,382 --> 01:08:07,371
- Hello.
- How about it?

999
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:09,711
We've got the governor
in the palm of our hands.

1000
01:08:09,885 --> 01:08:11,978
Great. Set the capitol
right on its dome?

1001
01:08:12,154 --> 01:08:15,180
- Oh, get in, will you, Polly?
- Don't forget to see the newspapers.

1002
01:08:15,357 --> 01:08:16,881
- No.
- And call the newsreel men.

1003
01:08:17,059 --> 01:08:19,323
- Don't forget the photographers.
- I'll swamp them.

1004
01:08:19,495 --> 01:08:21,895
Please be sure and ask
the governor's daughter down.

1005
01:08:22,064 --> 01:08:23,258
I'll get her. Don't worry.

1006
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:25,764
All right. Here, I wanna give you
something.

1007
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:27,027
Oh, what's that for?

1008
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:29,694
Well, you're going to need
an awful lot of luck.

1009
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:31,699
All right.

1010
01:08:31,874 --> 01:08:35,708
Say, you gonna be busy
on Sunday, say, in about 50 years?

1011
01:08:35,878 --> 01:08:37,539
No, I don't think so.

1012
01:08:37,713 --> 01:08:40,841
Would you like to help me celebrate
my golden wedding anniversary?

1013
01:08:41,016 --> 01:08:44,213
I'd love to, if you don't think
your wife would mind.

1014
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:47,312
All right, Rags.

1015
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:50,184
Well, come on around.

1016
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:53,260
All right, get going.
And no shortcuts.

1017
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:06,732
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hey, Danny. I'm glad to see you.

1018
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:08,035
What are you doing here?

1019
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:10,371
I heard you're looking for a short
piano player.

1020
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:13,037
- You can sit in anytime.
- How long will you be around?

1021
01:09:13,215 --> 01:09:15,149
We play a theater
and at the Upton Hotel.

1022
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:18,514
- Are you doing anything on the 17th?
- Seventeenth? Not that I know of.

1023
01:09:18,687 --> 01:09:20,052
- Then you've got a job.
- Swell.

1024
01:09:20,222 --> 01:09:22,122
- There you are.
- Hello, Marjorie.

1025
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:25,522
Do you think you have time
to meet 12 beautiful girls?

1026
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:27,753
Not more than six at a time.

1027
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:30,421
- I'll dig you later, Tom.
- Solid.

1028
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:33,261
I think you're one of the most
beautiful girls I ever saw.

1029
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:35,460
You do?

1030
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:39,369
I wouldn't be surprised if you were
chosen Queen of the Rodeo.

1031
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:41,373
That would be really exciting.

1032
01:09:41,544 --> 01:09:44,945
Oh, well, I can't make any promises,
but I could go to work on it.

1033
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:48,083
Oh, that's so sweet of you.

1034
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:51,583
You know, I think you're one
of the most beautiful girls I ever saw.

1035
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:53,654
Oh, that's a rather big statement.

1036
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:55,881
Oh, I've seen an awful lot of girls.

1037
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:58,355
And my picture will be in all the papers?

1038
01:09:58,527 --> 01:10:03,624
- After all, my father owns 14 and...
- oh, Danny, you're so fascinating.

1039
01:10:03,799 --> 01:10:07,496
In a small way, but fascinating.

1040
01:10:08,404 --> 01:10:11,100
I think you're one of the most
beautiful girls I ever saw.

1041
01:10:11,273 --> 01:10:12,968
Do you really?

1042
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:15,474
Yes. I've got books at home to prove it.

1043
01:10:15,644 --> 01:10:20,138
Oh, Danny, let's do sit the next one out.

1044
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:23,717
We certainly all shall. Come.

1045
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:26,314
Do you think the boys
might choose me queen?

1046
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:29,753
I'm chairman of the committee and
I've got an awful good ear for music.

1047
01:10:29,925 --> 01:10:33,486
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.
- Danny, you're delightful.

1048
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:37,365
Oh, I'm sorry. Here.

1049
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:41,499
My, what a lovely locket.

1050
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:45,299
- Did a girl give it to you?
- No, I've had it for quite some time.

1051
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:49,774
- Precious. Do you mind if I try it on?
- I'd rather you wouldn't, because I...

1052
01:10:49,945 --> 01:10:51,708
- May I?
- Well, I don't know.

1053
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:55,111
- Certainly, darling. Excuse me.
- Yeah.

1054
01:10:55,284 --> 01:10:56,751
Thank you.

1055
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:09,197
Ladies and gentlemen,
with your kind permission...

1056
01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:12,198
...presenting the music of that great
American composer...

1057
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:13,426
...Mr. George Gershwin.

1058
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:16,969
Our own arrangement
of "Fascinating Rhythm. "

1059
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:03,181
All right, everybody.
The polls are now open.

1060
01:17:03,352 --> 01:17:05,343
Step up and vote
for the Queen of the Rodeo.

1061
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,455
- Come on, everybody vote.
- Only vote for one at a time, folks.

1062
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:10,489
- Polls are now open.
- Ballots right here.

1063
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:11,648
Get your ballots.

1064
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:15,329
- Hi, Church.
- How's your steeple?

1065
01:17:15,497 --> 01:17:19,399
How did you know? Fine. Say, are there
really going to be 100 pretty girls here?

1066
01:17:19,568 --> 01:17:20,592
You bet there are.

1067
01:17:20,769 --> 01:17:23,033
I can see I'm in for a very quiet
weekend.

1068
01:17:23,205 --> 01:17:25,366
Wait a minute.
Listen, have you seen the dean?

1069
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:27,667
- Yeah.
- Is he still happy?

1070
01:17:27,843 --> 01:17:31,108
He's happy, but getting older.

1071
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:35,715
Hey, Mr. Danny,
I sure hope Miss Ginger wins.

1072
01:17:35,884 --> 01:17:38,148
Are you crazy? She better hadn't.

1073
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,448
Who better had?
The governor's daughter.

1074
01:17:41,623 --> 01:17:44,421
Wait a minute. I thought you told
Miss Ginger she'll win.

1075
01:17:44,593 --> 01:17:46,823
Oh, I've told a lot of girls
they're gonna win.

1076
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:48,758
- Why?
- We need the publicity.

1077
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:50,795
I think she's wonderful...

1078
01:17:50,966 --> 01:17:53,230
...and I'm terribly in love with her...

1079
01:17:53,402 --> 01:17:55,768
...but she just isn't news, Rags.

1080
01:17:55,937 --> 01:18:01,170
Mr. Danny, that's a lovely pair of boots
you got on, but I'd hate to be in them.

1081
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:07,047
Hey, Danny.
Hey, Dan, come here.

1082
01:18:07,716 --> 01:18:10,082
- Where have you been?
- Been counting up the votes.

1083
01:18:10,252 --> 01:18:14,018
- You're in the biggest trouble I ever saw.
- The junior league wants me for murder.

1084
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:16,419
Oh, tornado coming.

1085
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:21,286
Oh, Bud.

1086
01:18:21,663 --> 01:18:23,722
- Have you seen him yet?
- Who?

1087
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:28,063
- Danny Churchill.
- Oh, Danny.

1088
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:31,137
No, I haven't.
I think he went to sleep.

1089
01:18:31,306 --> 01:18:32,295
To sleep?

1090
01:18:32,474 --> 01:18:35,238
Yeah, he's got a pretty big day
tomorrow.

1091
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:37,776
Girls, I think I see Danny.

1092
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:39,675
- Where?
- Inside.

1093
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:44,884
Oh, thanks.

1094
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:46,884
- Where is Ginger?
- She's inside.

1095
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:52,183
You're gonna get fat if you don't stop
eating all those bananas.

1096
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,225
When you look like me
from the neck up...

1097
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,057
...from the neck down is no problem.

1098
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:58,461
Do you really think I'll win
the crown tonight?

1099
01:18:58,633 --> 01:18:59,622
Are you kidding?

1100
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:02,702
The rest of those dames aren't
even on the same floor with you.

1101
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:07,399
You know what you ought to do...
Hey. Hey, Ginger. Hey.

1102
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:11,012
Oh, that's fine, card tricks.

1103
01:19:13,048 --> 01:19:14,572
What is it, Danny?

1104
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,809
Ginger, you like me quite a bit,
don't you?

1105
01:19:16,985 --> 01:19:19,044
I think we're safe in saying that.

1106
01:19:19,221 --> 01:19:21,212
Well, I think you know
how I feel about you.

1107
01:19:21,389 --> 01:19:22,913
I think so.

1108
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:25,685
Remember once you told me
that about 100 years ago...

1109
01:19:25,861 --> 01:19:29,092
...an Indian pushed that rock
from the other side of that mountain...

1110
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:31,755
...just to prove to a girl
that he was on the level...

1111
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:33,901
...and she was the only one
he cared about?

1112
01:19:34,069 --> 01:19:35,229
That's right.

1113
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:40,370
Well, I want you to know that no matter
what happens tonight or anytime...

1114
01:19:40,542 --> 01:19:45,138
...I'd move that rock on the other side
of the mountain, any day, any night.

1115
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:47,011
It's a pretty tall mountain.

1116
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:49,847
We've got them taller than that.

1117
01:19:54,823 --> 01:19:56,882
Come on, let's go back to the dance.

1118
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:04,261
- The crowd's wonderful, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1119
01:20:04,432 --> 01:20:06,627
I guess the good-luck locket's
really working.

1120
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:11,066
Danny, could I have it back now?

1121
01:20:11,239 --> 01:20:14,003
I mean, just so that maybe
I could win the crown tonight.

1122
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:18,909
Well, Ginger, I forgot to tell you,
but I lost it on the road.

1123
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,809
- Hi there.
- Hi.

1124
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:23,314
Hello, Gramp.
Well, what do you think of it all?

1125
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:26,977
Well, I kind of lost track
of the whole thing miles back.

1126
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:31,117
- Isn't it nice? Danny, you really...
- Ginger.

1127
01:20:31,293 --> 01:20:33,955
Would you care to dance with Ginger?
Go ahead. It's fine.

1128
01:20:34,129 --> 01:20:37,394
- Well, Danny...
- Have fun. Dance.

1129
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:44,734
- Would you like to get some air?
- I'd love to.

1130
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:50,970
Danny. Danny Churchill.

1131
01:20:51,146 --> 01:20:54,604
Wait a minute, that's you.
Why, they're calling you.

1132
01:20:54,783 --> 01:20:57,445
- Well, go on up.
- Danny.

1133
01:20:57,619 --> 01:20:59,314
Oh, Danny.

1134
01:20:59,487 --> 01:21:01,887
- Danny.
- Attention, please.

1135
01:21:02,357 --> 01:21:05,520
And now,
the high point of our little jamboree.

1136
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:10,028
Mr. Danny Churchill will crown
the most attractive...

1137
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:13,827
...the most popular,
the most everything girl...

1138
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:16,470
...Queen of the Rodeo.

1139
01:21:20,508 --> 01:21:23,443
You're about to see a man buried alive.

1140
01:21:26,915 --> 01:21:28,883
Ladies and gent...

1141
01:21:29,351 --> 01:21:31,945
Ladies and gentlemen.

1142
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:37,023
I want to thank you all
for coming here tonight.

1143
01:21:37,192 --> 01:21:39,922
Especially the ladies.

1144
01:21:40,095 --> 01:21:44,498
There's nothing
that I'd rather do than this.

1145
01:21:46,868 --> 01:21:48,563
Thank you, Tom.

1146
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:51,001
Looks a little nervous, doesn't he?

1147
01:21:51,172 --> 01:21:53,436
- He's a study.
- Yeah.

1148
01:21:53,608 --> 01:21:55,735
In suicide.

1149
01:21:57,212 --> 01:22:01,911
There have been so many sensational
girls here tonight...

1150
01:22:02,117 --> 01:22:06,781
...that it's been quite a problem.

1151
01:22:08,056 --> 01:22:11,787
But it had to be done, anyhow.

1152
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:16,659
And I thought
that the voting was so close...

1153
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:19,800
...that you should meet the two girls...

1154
01:22:19,968 --> 01:22:23,699
...who came down the stretch together.

1155
01:22:25,073 --> 01:22:28,167
The delightful and talented...

1156
01:22:28,343 --> 01:22:31,835
...and lovely, Miss Ginger Gray.

1157
01:22:40,588 --> 01:22:43,557
And now the gracious...

1158
01:22:43,725 --> 01:22:46,990
...and lovely daughter of the governor...

1159
01:22:47,762 --> 01:22:52,563
...Miss Nancy Tait.
I mean Miss Marjorie Tait.

1160
01:22:56,004 --> 01:22:57,869
And now...

1161
01:22:58,039 --> 01:22:59,870
...for the queen.

1162
01:23:01,509 --> 01:23:05,206
It's with great pleasure...

1163
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:06,540
...and honor...

1164
01:23:06,715 --> 01:23:09,377
...on behalf of Cody College...

1165
01:23:09,951 --> 01:23:12,044
oh, I can't look at this.

1166
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:16,350
...to award the crown to...

1167
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:20,016
...Miss Marjorie Tait.

1168
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:24,662
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1169
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:26,596
I'm very happy...

1170
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:31,271
Lost it on the road?
What's she doing, hitchhiking?

1171
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:34,499
- Ginger, I can explain everything.
- Danny, wait, the crown.

1172
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:36,910
There.

1173
01:23:38,947 --> 01:23:41,507
Where do you want me to ship the body?

1174
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:44,078
Ginger, listen to me.

1175
01:23:44,252 --> 01:23:48,780
Remember what I told you
about moving the rock.

1176
01:23:48,957 --> 01:23:51,721
I wouldn't believe you
if you moved a mountain.

1177
01:23:51,893 --> 01:23:53,588
Ginger.

1178
01:23:55,563 --> 01:23:57,258
Miss Ginger.

1179
01:23:58,633 --> 01:24:03,502
Oh, Miss Ginger, you can't do that.
That's for kids.

1180
01:24:03,671 --> 01:24:06,401
Oh, Rags, I feel so miserable.

1181
01:24:06,574 --> 01:24:08,838
Oh, Miss Ginger...

1182
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:11,945
...you know I've known you
since you were that high...

1183
01:24:12,113 --> 01:24:16,174
...and I saw you fall off horses
and get run over...

1184
01:24:16,351 --> 01:24:19,252
...but, gee, I never saw you cry.

1185
01:24:21,456 --> 01:24:24,789
- You know what I came out here for?
- What?

1186
01:24:24,959 --> 01:24:27,359
You remember one day
you told me that...

1187
01:24:27,529 --> 01:24:29,520
Well, if ever I felt lonesome...

1188
01:24:29,697 --> 01:24:32,495
...that you'd sing me a song
just for me?

1189
01:24:34,969 --> 01:24:37,301
Well, I feel lonesome.

1190
01:24:43,678 --> 01:24:48,206
<i>Old man sunshine, listen you</i>

1191
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:52,513
<i>Never tell me dreams come true</i>

1192
01:24:52,687 --> 01:24:55,121
<i>Just try it</i>

1193
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:59,192
<i>And I'll start a riot</i>

1194
01:25:00,395 --> 01:25:04,764
<i>Beatrice Fairfax, don't you dare</i>

1195
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:09,063
<i>Ever tell me he will care</i>

1196
01:25:09,237 --> 01:25:14,971
<i>I'm certain it's the final curtain</i>

1197
01:25:15,143 --> 01:25:18,169
<i>I never want to hear</i>

1198
01:25:18,346 --> 01:25:21,213
<i>From any cheerful</i>

1199
01:25:21,382 --> 01:25:24,647
<i>Pollyannas</i>

1200
01:25:24,819 --> 01:25:27,913
<i>Who tell you</i>

1201
01:25:28,089 --> 01:25:32,651
<i>Fate supplies a mate</i>

1202
01:25:32,827 --> 01:25:38,322
<i>It's all bananas</i>

1203
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:44,033
<i>They're writing songs</i>

1204
01:25:44,205 --> 01:25:46,070
<i>Of love</i>

1205
01:25:46,241 --> 01:25:49,904
<i>But not for me</i>

1206
01:25:50,078 --> 01:25:54,913
<i>A lucky star's above</i>

1207
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:58,575
<i>But not for me</i>

1208
01:25:58,753 --> 01:26:03,486
<i>With love to lead the way</i>

1209
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:08,254
<i>I've found more skies of gray</i>

1210
01:26:08,429 --> 01:26:12,763
<i>Than any Russian play</i>

1211
01:26:12,934 --> 01:26:18,065
<i>Could guarantee</i>

1212
01:26:18,673 --> 01:26:23,269
<i>I was a fool</i>

1213
01:26:23,444 --> 01:26:25,275
<i>To fall</i>

1214
01:26:25,446 --> 01:26:29,473
<i>And get that way</i>

1215
01:26:29,651 --> 01:26:32,814
<i>Heigh-ho alas</i>

1216
01:26:32,987 --> 01:26:38,823
<i>And also lacka-day</i>

1217
01:26:38,993 --> 01:26:44,989
<i>Although I can't dismiss</i>

1218
01:26:45,466 --> 01:26:48,128
<i>The memory</i>

1219
01:26:48,303 --> 01:26:53,639
<i>Of his kiss</i>

1220
01:26:53,808 --> 01:26:56,902
<i>I guess</i>

1221
01:26:57,078 --> 01:27:01,515
<i>He's not</i>

1222
01:27:01,683 --> 01:27:05,847
<i>For</i>

1223
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:12,983
<i>Me</i>

1224
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:23,830
Rags, what's the matter?

1225
01:27:24,005 --> 01:27:26,872
I feel so much better now.

1226
01:27:27,041 --> 01:27:30,909
Oh, Rags, don't cry.

1227
01:27:33,147 --> 01:27:34,739
Ginger.

1228
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:50,993
Ginger.

1229
01:27:51,165 --> 01:27:53,030
Who's going away?

1230
01:27:53,468 --> 01:27:55,026
I am.

1231
01:27:56,237 --> 01:27:57,568
Where?

1232
01:27:57,739 --> 01:27:59,104
Back East with Polly.

1233
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:00,935
Back East?

1234
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:02,508
Why?

1235
01:28:04,545 --> 01:28:06,376
Lots of reasons.

1236
01:28:06,547 --> 01:28:07,809
When?

1237
01:28:07,982 --> 01:28:09,677
Pretty soon.

1238
01:28:10,184 --> 01:28:11,674
Ginger.

1239
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:14,511
Ginger, look at me.

1240
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:17,523
I'm looking.

1241
01:28:17,692 --> 01:28:19,626
I'm sorry.

1242
01:28:20,361 --> 01:28:21,988
You're not looking at me now.

1243
01:28:22,163 --> 01:28:24,757
I'm really sorry about your grandfather
and the school...

1244
01:28:24,932 --> 01:28:27,264
...and about your not winning the crown.

1245
01:28:27,869 --> 01:28:30,269
You're not angry with me really,
are you?

1246
01:28:30,438 --> 01:28:31,735
No.

1247
01:28:31,906 --> 01:28:34,374
And you know that I'm really sorry?

1248
01:28:34,542 --> 01:28:36,100
Yes.

1249
01:28:36,811 --> 01:28:38,403
Will you...?

1250
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:41,514
Will you write to me?

1251
01:28:42,850 --> 01:28:44,249
No.

1252
01:28:44,419 --> 01:28:45,977
Why not?

1253
01:28:48,656 --> 01:28:50,920
Because I won't have anything to write.

1254
01:28:51,092 --> 01:28:52,719
I will, though.

1255
01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:56,994
- You will?
- Yeah, lots of things.

1256
01:28:57,165 --> 01:28:59,633
About how I fell in love with you...

1257
01:28:59,801 --> 01:29:01,996
...under an old transmission...

1258
01:29:02,637 --> 01:29:05,105
...and how I felt
like cutting off my right arm...

1259
01:29:05,273 --> 01:29:08,071
...after I gave that other girl the crown.

1260
01:29:08,276 --> 01:29:12,770
Oh, I... I don't care about that.

1261
01:29:12,947 --> 01:29:14,847
You're not looking at me.

1262
01:29:16,651 --> 01:29:18,209
Ginger.

1263
01:29:18,386 --> 01:29:20,616
Wait. I want to tell you about the locket.

1264
01:29:20,788 --> 01:29:23,848
- I don't wanna hear about it.
- Well, here it is.

1265
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:25,424
Why, I don't want it.

1266
01:29:25,593 --> 01:29:28,061
- I don't even wanna touch it.
- Take it, please?

1267
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:31,926
Every time I'll look at it, I'll hate
myself for the rest of my life.

1268
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:35,032
Oh, won't you, please?

1269
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:36,894
Did you ever...?

1270
01:29:37,071 --> 01:29:39,835
Ever kiss that debutante?

1271
01:29:40,007 --> 01:29:41,975
I take an oath.

1272
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:44,841
Did you ever want to?

1273
01:29:45,012 --> 01:29:47,276
Never mind, don't answer that.

1274
01:29:47,849 --> 01:29:49,407
Ginger.

1275
01:29:53,554 --> 01:29:56,114
- We tried to make a three-ring...
- Hallelujah. Excuse me.

1276
01:29:56,290 --> 01:29:57,382
- Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah.

1277
01:29:57,558 --> 01:29:59,856
- What's the meaning of this?
- Cody comes to life.

1278
01:30:00,027 --> 01:30:02,188
- You keep out of this.
- No, sir.

1279
01:30:02,363 --> 01:30:03,921
Why, hello, Dad.

1280
01:30:04,098 --> 01:30:06,157
Do you know this school
isn't going to close?

1281
01:30:06,334 --> 01:30:07,733
- It isn't?
- No. Look at this.

1282
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:10,200
- Applications for admittance.
- To this school.

1283
01:30:10,371 --> 01:30:11,702
- Next year.
- Over 200 of them.

1284
01:30:11,873 --> 01:30:14,364
- The governor can't close the school.
- He can't?

1285
01:30:14,542 --> 01:30:16,669
Now, get yourself all set now.
Are you ready?

1286
01:30:16,844 --> 01:30:18,141
- Ready for anything.
- Yeah.

1287
01:30:18,312 --> 01:30:19,904
These applications are from girls.

1288
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:21,514
- From what?
- Girls.

1289
01:30:21,682 --> 01:30:23,445
Why not make the school coeducational?

1290
01:30:23,618 --> 01:30:26,951
- Oh, no.
- Didn't I tell you girls had a future?

1291
01:30:27,121 --> 01:30:30,989
I always said you were girl crazy.
I was wrong. You're just crazy.

1292
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:33,821
- Wait a minute.
- I don't feel that way. It's a good idea.

1293
01:30:33,995 --> 01:30:36,395
No, not you.
Get me the governor.

1294
01:30:36,564 --> 01:30:38,657
You heard me, the governor. Yes.

1295
01:30:39,066 --> 01:30:43,435
- And reverse the charges.
- Oh, Gramp.

1296
01:30:48,142 --> 01:30:49,905
- Is everybody having fun?
- Yeah.

1297
01:30:50,077 --> 01:30:51,635
That's only the beginning.

1298
01:30:51,813 --> 01:30:55,305
Now, the golden voice of the golden
West, our own Ginger Gray.

1299
01:30:55,483 --> 01:30:58,816
Singing "I Got Rhythm" accompanied
by Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra...

1300
01:30:58,986 --> 01:31:00,112
...and that ain't hay.

1301
01:31:16,504 --> 01:31:22,067
<i>Days can be sunny with never a sigh</i>

1302
01:31:22,243 --> 01:31:28,409
<i>Don't need what money can buy</i>

1303
01:31:28,583 --> 01:31:34,078
<i>Birds in the tree sing</i>
<i>Their day full of song</i>

1304
01:31:34,255 --> 01:31:41,127
<i>Why shouldn't we sing along?</i>

1305
01:31:41,295 --> 01:31:44,856
<i>I'm chipper all the day</i>

1306
01:31:45,032 --> 01:31:48,468
<i>Happy with my lot</i>

1307
01:31:48,636 --> 01:31:52,572
<i>How do I get that way?</i>

1308
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:58,110
<i>Look at what I've got</i>

1309
01:31:58,279 --> 01:32:00,110
<i>I got rhythm</i>

1310
01:32:00,281 --> 01:32:02,078
<i>I got music</i>

1311
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:06,016
<i>I got my man</i>
<i>Who could ask for anything more?</i>

1312
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:09,884
<i>I got daisies in green pastures</i>

1313
01:32:10,057 --> 01:32:13,788
<i>I got my man</i>
<i>Who could ask for anything more?</i>

1314
01:32:13,961 --> 01:32:17,658
<i>Old man trouble, I don't mind him</i>

1315
01:32:17,832 --> 01:32:21,495
<i>You won't find him around my door</i>

1316
01:32:21,669 --> 01:32:23,432
<i>I got starlight</i>

1317
01:32:23,604 --> 01:32:25,367
<i>I got sweet dreams</i>

1318
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:28,532
<i>I got my man</i>
<i>Who could ask for anything more?</i>

1319
01:32:28,709 --> 01:32:30,870
<i>Who could ask for anything more?</i>

1320
01:32:31,312 --> 01:32:35,146
<i>Who could ask, who could ask</i>
<i>Who could ask for anything more?</i>

1321
01:32:35,316 --> 01:32:39,252
- <i>I got rhythm, I got music</i>
- <i>I got rhythm, I got music</i>

1322
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:42,617
- <i>I got my man</i>

1323
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:46,351
<i>I got daisies in green pastures</i>

1324
01:32:46,527 --> 01:32:49,496
<i>I got my man</i>
<i>Who could ask for anything more?</i>

1325
01:32:49,664 --> 01:32:53,191
- <i>Old man trouble, I don't mind him</i>
- <i>Old man trouble, I don't mind him</i>

1326
01:32:53,367 --> 01:32:55,801
- <i>You won't find him</i>
- <i>You won't find him</i>

1327
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:57,938
<i>Hanging round my front or back door</i>

1328
01:32:58,105 --> 01:32:59,800
<i>I got starlight</i>

1329
01:32:59,974 --> 01:33:02,909

<i>I got rhythm</i>

<i>I got music</i>

1334
01:33:19,093 --> 01:33:20,720
<i>I got my man</i>

1335
01:33:20,895 --> 01:33:22,419
<i>Who could ask</i>... <i>?</i>
<i>Who could ask</i>... <i>?</i>

1336
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:26,624
<i>Who could ask</i>
