FOR TOO LONG A TIME.

1136
01:31:58,084 --> 01:32:02,217
BUT FOR ONE SECOND--
[ Chuckles ]
OH, BOY !

1137
01:32:32,950 --> 01:32:37,451
I KNOW IT'S WRONG,
BUT I HAVE THIS TREMENDOUS URGE
TO SING "AULD LANG SYNE."

1138
01:32:57,785 --> 01:33:00,251
DID YOU CLOSE THE WINDOWS
IN YOUR ROOM ?

1139
01:33:03,050 --> 01:33:07,785
WELL, IT'S ALL OVER,
MY DARLING.
WE'RE GOING HOME NOW.

1140
01:33:07,851 --> 01:33:12,184
MY PLACE ISN'T MUCH--
TWO SMALL ROOMS,

1141
01:33:12,251 --> 01:33:14,184
A FURNISHED MEDICINE CABINET.

1142
01:33:14,251 --> 01:33:16,317
BUT WE'LL BE MARRIED.

1143
01:33:16,384 --> 01:33:20,751
AND SOON THERE'LL BE THE SOUND
OF TINY FLANKENS RUNNING AROUND.

1144
01:33:20,818 --> 01:33:24,584
OH, FELIX !
[ Sobs ]

1145
01:33:24,651 --> 01:33:27,418
WH-WH-WHAT IS IT ?

1146
01:33:27,484 --> 01:33:30,317
WHAT HAVE I SAID ?
WE'LL GET A BIGGER PLACE.

1147
01:33:30,384 --> 01:33:32,818
I'LL GIVE UP SNEEZING.
WHAT IS IT ?

1148
01:33:32,885 --> 01:33:36,050
OH, FELIX,
I CAN NEVER MARRY YOU.

1149
01:33:36,117 --> 01:33:39,518
YOU CAN'T ?
YOU DON'T LOVE ME ?

1150
01:33:39,584 --> 01:33:44,451
YES, I DO.
I DO LOVE YOU, AND THAT'S
WHY I WON'T MARRY YOU.

1151
01:33:44,518 --> 01:33:47,651
WELL, FRANCESCA,
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

1152
01:33:47,718 --> 01:33:51,084
I CAN'T KEEP ON DATING YOU
IN JUNGLES.

1153
01:33:51,151 --> 01:33:54,917
NO, FELIX.  THERE'S
SOMETHING I MUST TELL YOU.

1154
01:33:54,984 --> 01:33:58,751
HAVEN'T YOU WONDERED
WHY I WAS ON THAT ISLAND ?

1155
01:33:58,818 --> 01:34:03,317
YOU SEE, I'M NOT
A HUMAN BEING LIKE YOU ARE.

1156
01:34:03,384 --> 01:34:08,184
I WAS CREATED BY FRANKENSTEIN
AFTER THE MONSTER AND HIS MATE.

1157
01:34:08,251 --> 01:34:11,017
I WAS HIS MASTERPIECE.

1158
01:34:11,084 --> 01:34:16,050
BUT WHERE OTHER WOMEN HAVE
A HEART, I HAVE A SPRING
THAT WILL UNWIND.

1159
01:34:16,117 --> 01:34:18,351
WHERE OTHER WOMEN HAVE LUNGS,

1160
01:34:18,418 --> 01:34:22,618
I'VE GOT A PUMP THAT RUNS
ON BATTERIES WHICH WILL RUN OUT.

1161
01:34:22,684 --> 01:34:25,618
WHERE OTHER WOMEN HAVE
ELBOWS AND KNEES,

1162
01:34:25,684 --> 01:34:30,518
I HAVE METALLIC JOINTS
THAT WILL ONE DAY
GROW RUSTY AND STIFFEN.

1163
01:34:30,584 --> 01:34:35,651
I'M JUST A MACHINE WITH
HUNDREDS OF PARTS THAT WILL
EVENTUALLY WEAR OUT.

1164
01:34:35,718 --> 01:34:39,151
WELL, FRANCESCA--
[ Sneezes Violently ]

1165
01:34:39,217 --> 01:34:42,917
WELL, FRANCESCA,
NONE OF US ARE PERFECT--
[ Clicking ]

1166
01:34:42,984 --> 01:34:45,551
ARE PERFECT--  [ Clicking ]
ARE PERFECT--  [ Clicking ]
ARE PERFECT--  [ Clicking ]

1167
01:34:45,618 --> 01:34:47,551
