Rock and roll!

15
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,919
Go on.

16
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,279
Hi!

17
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,359
Come with me.

18
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,359
How long did you spend
in the United States?

19
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,199
Four years.

20
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,599
And then six months in Manchester.

21
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,679
Manchester!

22
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,359
- Did you see any football?
- Of course.

23
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,319
We lived next to the stadium.

24
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,199
Manchester are no big deal,
are they?!

25
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,359
Honved would thrash them!

26
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,159
- Go Honved!
- Go Honved!

27
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,879
How long do you plan to stay?

28
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,119
- A pretty long time.
- More specifically?

29
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,919
Twenty or thirty years, minimum.

30
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,759
Could you tell me
why you came back to Hungary?

31
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,679
Because of Honved.

32
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,959
The footie's better here.

33
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,119
- It's all been organised
with the Ministry. - Really?!

34
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,919
We'll soon see about that.

35
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,839
Yes?

36
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,319
Yes!

37
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,759
Sixty-two forint.

38
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,599
Sixty...

39
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,999
...two.

40
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,759
Who are you?

41
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,119
Balogh. I'm the joint tenant.

42
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,279
The bathroom is mine
until 5:30

43
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,199
and the kitchen until 7:00.

44
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,959
Everything is yours after 8:00.

45
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:19,999
Stay with me tonight!

46
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,599
Baby-doll, Stay with me tonight!

47
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,759
I'm on my knees and begging please,

48
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,359
Stay with me tonight!

49
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,079
Stay tonight now please!

50
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,719
One more night is all I need!

51
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,919
Baby, baby, give this night to me!

52
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,279
Stay with me tonight!

53
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,119
Stay tonight now please!
Solo...

54
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,319
Stay, babe...

55
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,119
Stay, babe!

56
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,799
Stay with me,
You're my baby!

57
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,319
Stay with me tonight!

58
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,919
Thanks a lot!
That was the Angela Band!

59
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,759
Angel Land, Angel Land.

60
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,079
Sure, that's right.
You boys go and load your stuff.

61
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,759
I'm delighted to welcome everyone
on such a beautiful day.

62
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,679
You can come a bit closer!
Don't be scared, I don't bite!

63
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,759
- You were great!
- Thanks.

64
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,599
- Did it sound okay?
- Brilliant! You were great!

65
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,119
Can we carry your guitar, Rone?

66
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,119
No one want to take this?

67
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,279
Hi, baby! You look wonderful!

68
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:52,599
And now for one of the musical
highlights of the afternoon,

69
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,199
from the Number-Two Automobile
Repair Workshop

70
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,639
the one and only Figaro!

71
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,319
You show them, son! Go on!

72
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,759
There are places in the world
abroad today,

73
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,839
Where they only think of work
and never play.

74
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,279
Over there they've got it all wrong,
They should all sing this song.

75
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,239
The work you do means more
than just pay.

76
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,639
The Angela Band was really good!

77
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,959
Angel Land.

78
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,079
- I'm counting on you for state
holidays! - Will you pay us then?

79
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,719
You got drinks, didn't you?

80
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,679
- Didn't you get your "Bambi"?
- Sure!

81
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,079
Thanks for the refreshments,
Comrade Bigali!

82
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,279
Enjoy!

83
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,199
Bigali can stuff
his "Bambi" up his...!

84
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,199
Csipu, go get some shots
and a tray of beer.

85
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,879
You are loaded!

86
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:11,759
So lift your hands up high
and all sing after me.

87
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,359
So lift your hands up high,
up up up high, up high

88
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,639
and all sing after me.

89
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:27,279
Over there they never have
a happy day.

90
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,679
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

91
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,199
Who's that?

92
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,279
I don't know.
I've never seen him before.

93
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,759
A mango and vanilla shake.

94
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,239
- Have you run out?
- We've just got this!

95
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,879
He looks bloody familiar...

96
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,759
Hi, Csipu!

97
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,279
Hi there...

98
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,919
- Miki!!
- Kids, it's Miki!

99
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,079
- Hi, guys!
- Hi, Miki!

100
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,799
- You look great!
- Thanks.

101
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,359
- Shit hot!
- Hey! Watch the hair!

102
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,999
- Okay. Hi! Welcome to Hungary!
- Drink this instead!

103
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,919
What is it?

104
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,279
- Whiskey!
- No! Really?

105
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,079
An Elvis lighter!

106
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,719
- Let's have a look!
- Kid!

107
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,759
- Have you crawled back home?
- Shame you missed us!

108
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,279
We played
"Stay Here Tomorrow"!

109
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,879
- What?
- It's cool!

110
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,919
- We got it off Radio Luxembourg!
- Hang on!

111
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,599
- You know Frank Sinatra?
- We did him too.

112
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,639
No one listens to Sinatra
anymore.

113
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,639
Really?

114
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,359
- Will you tell us
what they listen to? - Sure!

115
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,959
Stuff like Johnny Cash
and Jerry Lee Lewis!

116
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,999
- I love Jerry Lee!
- You should see him live.

117
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,839
You've seen Jerry Lee live?

118
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,759
Don't swallow everything!

119
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,999
I saw him in Kansas City with
Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins.

120
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,079
- You saw Carl Perkins?
- Come on!

121
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,599
Perkins!

122
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,239
- Perkins...
- No!

123
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,199
- Perkins.
- Perkins!

124
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,679
What about Kansas City?

125
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,919
The best thing
that ever happened to me!

126
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,359
Was it wild?

127
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,359
Wild? The support band went off
and all the lights went out.

128
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,159
Then a thousand spots
came on all at once

129
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,639
and Jerry Lee was standing
at the piano.

130
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,759
He wore sequined white
trousers,

131
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,959
a French wig on his head,
and silver moccasins.

132
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,079
He said...

133
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,599
Don't drink all the whiskey!

134
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,199
"I stick my finger in hot pussy

135
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,919
and wipe it along the keys
so the stride slides better."

136
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,359
That's wild!

137
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,319
Jerry started with his left hand
and then the right joined in.

138
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,279
A gentle tinkle

139
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,079
and the feet started.

140
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,319
Then the knees.

141
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,599
Let's see your knees!

142
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,079
Comrades! Emergency!

143
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,239
Urgent police intervention
is required!

144
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,159
Fucking move!

145
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,759
Welcome to
employees of the interior Ministry.

146
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,599
You are the swift response unit!

147
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,039
What are you playing at?!

148
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,639
Let's show them a really
happy day!

149
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,919
Left hand's boogie,
right hand's rock,

150
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,999
Show us girls, what you all got!

151
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,599
Let's rock,

152
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,039
everybody rock.

153
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,319
The people's will can't be stopped

154
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,879
When we go wild
with the people's rock!

155
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,079
Way down south,

156
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,679
back of the woods,

157
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,959
I grew up there,

158
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,319
the best I could.

159
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,919
Through the good times and the bad

160
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,279
the boogie was the only hope I had.

161
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,359
So I took my chance
like Memphis would.

162
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,199
Where the southern sun
never fails to shine,

163
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,919
The boogie-woogie rhythm
was always mine.

164
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,039
Playing the piano night and day,

165
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,679
All those southern girls
came out to play.

166
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,879
The dance floor is the place for me,

167
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,119
Two hands where they should
always be,

168
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,679
Between the waistband and the knee!

169
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,279
Music from the USA,

170
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,959
Playing in the park for you today.

171
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,199
We ain't listening

172
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,199
to what you say.

173
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,999
Let's rock,

174
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,999
everybody rock.

175
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,359
In the shadow of the Eastern Bloc,

176
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,079
Let's go wild with the people's rock.

177
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,919
Just one thing:

178
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,159
don't never give up.

179
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,759
Life's a Coca-Cola,

180
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,319
so drink it up!

181
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,079
Closer, closer! A bit closer!

182
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,639
You can be what you want to be
from ABC to XYZ.

183
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,839
Good tunes are our only goal,

184
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,879
They simply call it rock and roll!

185
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,839
Water cannons now!

186
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,959
Fuck you too, mate!

187
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,199
Someone went and called the cops,

188
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,279
It'll take much more to make us stop.

189
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,119
Music from the USA

190
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,639
Playing in the park for you today.

191
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,079
We're listening to what they play,

192
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,959
Though we all might get locked away.

193
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,919
This is one lively May Day!

194
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,959
Let's go!

195
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:30,799
Let's go wild to the people's rock!

196
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,199
We've all gone wild
to the people's rock!

197
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,359
Where have you been?
What do you look like?

198
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,959
- I got wet.
- It hasn't been raining.

199
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,639
A passing shower.

200
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,759
On Tisza Street?

201
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,039
How do you know?
Who grassed?

202
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,279
You are in Hungary now, son!

203
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,799
Everyone sees and hears everything.

204
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,679
Have you been out like that?

205
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,199
I'll fetch a towel.

206
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,359
Just look at yourself!

207
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,959
Pure provocation!

208
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,359
It's just a Hawaiian shirt.

209
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,239
You have to blend
into the background...

210
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,319
Be a sparrow among sparrows

211
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,839
and not parade around
like a cockatoo!

212
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,999
You never had a problem
with this shirt before!

213
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,239
- It was fine on 5th Avenue but
not here. - Really?

214
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,319
So why aren't we still
on 5th Avenue?!

215
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,839
Did I ask you to
drag me back here?!

216
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,119
This is our home, my boy!

217
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,039
It's your home!

218
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,279
I'm really sorry, Comrade Miltenyi.
It's not my fault.

219
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:33,359
They changed the programme
and the youth reacted badly.

220
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,239
They went completely mad.

221
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,959
They're not interested in "Pol-Beat".
They just want the tom-tom.

222
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,959
This is where freedom has taken us.

223
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,919
Have you ever been grape-picking...
Comrade Bigali?

224
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,679
Grape-picking?

225
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,199
When the grapes...

226
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,079
Precisely.

227
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,279
What mustn't you do to the barrels
of grape juice?

228
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,239
Close them. But why?

229
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,199
Why?

230
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:15,679
Because they start to ferment
and then... boom!

231
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,159
Is the picture clear, Comrade Bigali?

232
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,759
Clear. Completely clear.

233
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,359
The youth have started to ferment and
that's not necessarily a bad thing.

234
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,759
They need to be given space.

235
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,719
Of course, all within strict limits.

236
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,799
There is a new directive,
Comrade Bigali.

237
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,359
We are going to organise
a talent competition.

238
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,839
The youth

239
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,999
can explore their identity
within a cultured environment.

240
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,159
I am depending on you to organise
the district qualifiers.

241
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,079
Thank you.
It will be an honour.

242
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,359
It wasn't easy.

243
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,079
I stood up for you.

244
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,239
Don't let me down... Arpad!

245
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,879
Thank you... Sandor.

246
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,199
Cultural centres across
the country

247
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,759
are filled with the sound
of feverish preparation

248
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,919
as the auditions are announced
for "Show What You Know".

249
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,359
It is important that we increase
our pupils' artistic activity

250
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,719
and for them to take part
in such events.

251
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,159
Entrants are invited for poetry
reading, music groups...

252
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,759
Can you read it, sweetheart?

253
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,799
- "Show What You Know".
- Clever you. That's right!

254
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,079
Do you want it?

255
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,039
Sure.
Any more where that came from?

256
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,319
Are you interested in
American records?

257
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,319
Sure.

258
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,039
Okay.

259
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,199
Cool wheels.

260
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,079
- Can I give it a go some time?
- Sure, why not?

261
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,239
But be careful because
it's brand-new.

262
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,759
- "Brook 'en hairy ha."
- No!

263
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,919
It's "broken heart", man.

264
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,679
You looking for something?

265
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,159
Listen!
Tripolisz on drums, Csipu...

266
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,199
Csipu and Nyiro guitar.

267
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,599
And then you and me.
What do you say?

268
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,919
I know a stack of Jerry Lee Lewis
numbers and we can sing in English.

269
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,079
Like in real English!

270
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,319
It'd be cool.
What do you reckon?

271
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,119
And...

272
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,319
we could think up the hair and
the image and the whole thing.

273
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:20,919
What?

274
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,919
We could be a pro band.

275
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,599
Balloons, smoke, coloured lights,
backing singers. The whole lot.

276
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,599
The gig could be ready in time
for "Show What You Know".

277
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,919
- Gig?
- Gig!

278
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,159
That's what they call it over there.

279
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,919
Hands off my band, you little monkey!

280
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,199
Summer by the pool,

281
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,959
Sun's hot, water's cool!

282
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,959
The girl's are pretty hot,

283
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,999
Come on down
and you can see the lot!

284
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,359
Let's go a ride on your moped,

285
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,199
I ain't gonna listen
to what my ma said.

286
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,999
Step on the gas
and not on the brake,

287
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,919
Pretty checks are waiting
down at the lake.

288
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,719
We've tried
all the dances on the list,

289
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,639
The time has come to try the twist!

290
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,319
Tune in on my radio,

291
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,159
Rock and roll's the only way to go!

292
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,959
Come on, come on, Julie,
you know I'll love you truly

293
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,879
all the summer long.

294
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,719
The party starts at six
I won't look at other chicks,

295
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,639
Dance the twist with me
and you can't go wrong!

296
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,799
This is a dance not like the rest,

297
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,679
You've danced with the others
but I am the best.

298
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,359
Come on, baby, it will be fine,

299
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,239
Dance with me in the summer sunshine!

300
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,199
I brought it in for a full service.

301
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,959
Let's go and eat.

302
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,879
Hey, what's that?

303
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,119
A tap.

304
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,119
- Tap?
- Press it!

305
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,359
- Thanks fellas.
- Hi, Miki!

306
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,759
Hi there!

307
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,799
- Do you recognise me?
- Of course.

308
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,919
You came back then?

309
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,679
It sort of looks like it.

310
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,199
Who was that?

311
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,919
No one.

312
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,759
Just a girl.

313
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,199
Let's show them all
how to do the grind!

314
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,039
- What's the grind?
- This is the grind!

315
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,799
Now let's show them
how to do the wind!

316
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,079
- What's the wind?
- This is the wind!

317
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,759
- Stamp that cigarette out!
- Go, go!

318
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,679
- If you like, it give a shout!
- Oh, oh!

319
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,359
- Come on now and let it all out!
- Go, go!

320
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,079
Let's go!

321
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,599
I guess this means we're not going
to the cinema tonight.

322
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,199
Sure we are! Eight o'clock.

323
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,319
We agreed to meet at eight.

324
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,719
What's going on?

325
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,239
Grab him!

326
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,319
What's that?

327
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,119
Buddy Holly?

328
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,319
What kind of name is Buddy?

329
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,239
Buddy Holly.

330
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,199
- He's American.
- America? Typical.

331
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,919
And they've got the atomic bomb?
Has the world gone mad?

332
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,759
Buddy and the boys have got the bomb.
Where did you get this from?

333
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,999
Are you distributing contraband goods?

334
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,959
It's not contraband.

335
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,599
- No?
- No!

336
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,959
If I see you here again, I'll kick
your arses! ls the picture clear?

337
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,319
- Clear.
- Sorry!

338
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,239
- It's clear!
- Make yourselves scarce!

339
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,599
No more pool for you this summer.

340
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,359
The Yankee stays where he is.

341
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,319
You're not a bad kid, I know that.

342
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,839
But they don't want to believe me.

343
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,359
Who?

344
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,119
They say that you are

345
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,919
ruining the minds
of the Hungarian youth.

346
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,879
What am I doing?

347
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:16,039
You have imported this infection,
this virus.

348
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,319
- It's just a record.
- This?

349
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,839
No, son.

350
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,079
This is six years in prison.
Anti-state agitation.

351
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,599
- That's rubbish.
- What did you say?

352
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,199
- I said it's rubbish.
- I thought I heard wrong.

353
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,359
Did your dad bring things like
this back too?

354
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,759
- Insightful literature?
- Leave my dad out of this.

355
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,079
Okay. We can do that.

356
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,759
- Do you know about
"Show What You Know"? - Yes.

357
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,079
I have got a couple of protégés
in the Young Socialists

358
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,039
and a couple of the girls can sing...

359
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,319
Gretchen and Hella might come
with two others from East Germany.

360
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,359
I want you to do something colossal
with them and my son.

361
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,879
What do you say?

362
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,919
Good.

363
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,639
And leave your father to me.

364
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,639
We'll offer him a helping hand.

365
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,199
Tuesday it is then.

366
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,039
Buddy Hooligan.

367
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,119
No more ham?

368
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,839
Bacon, son! Bacon!

369
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,719
Bacon...
Okay, bacon.

370
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,119
Your father has been
to the Ministry today.

371
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,759
They won't take him back.

372
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,199
Kollar doesn't work there anymore,
he's been transferred...

373
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,999
or something.

374
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,719
All new faces.

375
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,679
They promised to let him know
if anything comes up.

376
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:22,119
We'll just have to make do with
what I earn at the hairdresser's.

377
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:26,159
And that is very tough
for a man to live with.

378
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,119
Am I interrupting?

379
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,599
Preparations are going
precisely to plan.

380
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,239
The activity of the pupils
is exceeding all expectations.

381
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,999
Very good.

382
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,119
Prosit!

383
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,279
It goes something like this.

384
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,279
Getting ready for my first ball,

385
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,839
And I'll never forget it all.

386
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,119
Jacket and tie, shoes all shined,

387
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,159
I was looking all so fine.

388
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,079
Combed my hair in the barber's chair,

389
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,119
Heard a tune or two
and just dreaming of you.

390
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,359
Join in now!

391
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,679
Ciao Marina!

392
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,039
It was always so great with you!

393
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,359
Ciao Marina!

394
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,599
My love for you was always so true.

395
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,599
I love you.

396
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,159
Your taxi, sir!

397
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,079
Welcome to the winning team!

398
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,359
Ciao Marina!

399
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,919
You're my darling angel from above.

400
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,279
Ciao Marina!

401
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,359
I still don't know
how we fell in love.

402
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,639
I love you.

403
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,719
Stop!

404
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,199
You're speeding up!
Don't be stupid!

405
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,239
- You're all over the place!
- What's your problem?

406
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,959
- I've got the right tempo!
- Entschuldigung!

407
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,959
- Ist Miki zufallig hier?
- Csipu, you're good at Russian.

408
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:45,159
- Just because I didn't fail!
- Wir suchen einen gewissen Miki.

409
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,039
Hello!

410
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,199
- Tripolisz.
- Gretchen.

411
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,319
- Kak tyibja zavut?
- You idiot, she's called Gretchen.

412
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,919
- Csipu.
- Gretchen.

413
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,919
- Lotti.
- Tripolisz.

414
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,999
- Csipu.
- Lotti.

415
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,039
- Sura.
- Gretchen.

416
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,039
Ich bin malenkij Nyiro.

417
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,919
Oh... they're already here.

418
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,639
Madchen!

419
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,599
Wiedersehen... Ja.

420
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,639
Tschuss...

421
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,599
You can start packing!
Come on, one two!

422
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,359
What are you doing here?

423
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,079
You know...
East German cultural gift hamper.

424
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,079
What's the whispering?

425
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,319
Make yourself scarce!

426
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,199
Well, girls...
Los, los, ja?

427
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,239
- Comrade Bigali.
- Yes?

428
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,679
- Could the boys join in?
- Reach into your mouth,

429
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,719
remove what's in it,

430
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,879
and continue.
Yes?

431
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,159
So, could Csipu and the boys
join us?

432
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,079
It would be good for the girls.
We could rehearse with a band.

433
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,239
Why not? it's a colossal idea!

434
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,359
Okay, you can unpack.

435
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,119
- But we...
- Sorry, kid, no time to waste!

436
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,599
- I'll get you for this.
- It'll be fine, you'll see!

437
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,039
- What?
- Your hair looks great.

438
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,199
Thanks.

439
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,599
- Where are you going, son?
- It's six o'clock.

440
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,999
Get back on stage!

441
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,839
I'll bring a doctor's note, okay...
Bigali?

442
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:51,959
Right.

443
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,639
You can walk out if you like.

444
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,039
- If I embarrass you or the girls.
- Or me.

445
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,039
We're waiting.

446
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,599
Right.

447
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,319
- What are we going to hear?
- An American...

448
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,639
What?

449
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,799
- Latin... Latin-American
- Sorry?

450
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,359
Cuban...
...a Cuban song.

451
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,359
Great. What's it about?

452
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,039
The workers on the plantation
conspire behind the foreman's back

453
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:33,199
and discuss where they are to hold
their illegal communist gathering.

454
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,919
Great!

455
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,119
Let's see it!

456
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,679
And the East German girls?
I trust they are in good hands!

457
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,279
Hang on!
I don't understand!

458
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,959
But of course!
Comrade Bigali is looking after them.

459
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,599
Stop a minute!

460
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,759
Where's the plantation?

461
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,959
Is this the illegal plot?

462
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,199
You get out of here!

463
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,319
I don't believe this!

464
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,359
Stop this reactionary music, Miki!

465
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,359
Stop now!

466
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,599
Comrade Bigali?

467
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,759
Comrade Miltenyi.

468
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,679
This is... it's a little...

469
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,159
A little... Cuban Mediterranean...

470
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,239
music that got a little...

471
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,839
How shall I say?

472
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,239
A little song
from the Cuban plantations and...

473
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,599
Kubanische revolutionen...

474
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,079
And that is the point we are at.

475
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,599
More or less.

476
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,359
Ja, stimmt!

477
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,079
Chewing gum?

478
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,079
- What chewing gum?
- No chewing gum.

479
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,239
- Try to be normal.
- Okay.

480
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,799
Don't be your usual self...

481
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,199
Sanyi Miltenyi is
my only influential friend.

482
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,159
He's promised to find me
some acceptable work.

483
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:25,039
- Do you understand what I am asking?
- He's understood.

484
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,599
The wanderer returns.

485
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,999
Come on in. This way please.

486
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,919
- Hello! And you?
- The young one.

487
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,359
- Hello, my dear.
- Hello!

488
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,079
- Hello!
- Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

489
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,039
Just a bit of lipstick.

490
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:14,359
Vera! Surprise!
Looks who's here!

491
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,119
Well, you've grown into a big girl!
A young lady.

492
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,719
- Hello!
- Hello, my dear!

493
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,679
- Hi!
- Hi!

494
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,359
What's wrong?
You two used to be so close.

495
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:35,279
So how was the land of milk
and honey?

496
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,679
Not for us.

497
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,359
They don't make such good stew
do they?

498
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,799
They call it goulash over there.

499
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,239
Goulash?

500
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,919
Goulash is goulash.

501
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,199
And stew is stew.

502
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,079
Am I right?

503
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,359
- Vera made the dumplings!
- Mother!

504
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:04,319
You cook beautifully!
She's a treasure!

505
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,759
- She'll make some man very happy.
- Did you hear that, Miki?

506
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,839
Miki hasn't got time for that.

507
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,799
He's become very active recently.
I saw it with my own eyes.

508
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,279
- I didn't know that.
- You can be proud of him!

509
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:24,279
He is preparing four East German
comrades for "Show What You Know".

510
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,199
I'm pleased to hear it.

511
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,119
Vera's entering
the competition too.

512
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,599
- That's not been decided.
- Oh yes it has!

513
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,039
But let's talk about
more serious matters.

514
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,839
What are we going to drink?

515
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,839
Vera!

516
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,759
Why didn't you answer my letters,
Miki?

517
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:27,279
Why, did you write any?
Did you really write to me?

518
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,799
Don't do that, it's pathetic!

519
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,799
You know I wrote.

520
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,159
Like we agreed.
A letter a week.

521
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,639
I spent all my pocket money
on stamps.

522
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,679
I'm sorry. Really I am.

523
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,719
And I can pay for the stamps...

524
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,999
Who cares about the stupid stamps?

525
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,719
You dropped me, that's all.
No big deal.

526
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,359
I thought we'd never see
each other again.

527
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,759
There was no point
in digging up the past.

528
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,959
- And I'm the past you had to dig up?
- Not at all!

529
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,919
Listen, Miki!

530
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,039
I'm not angry with you.

531
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,959
We were just kids.

532
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,319
We thought it was more, it was
different, it was the real thing...

533
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,719
But we were wrong. That's all.

534
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,759
You'll find someone else.

535
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,599
You've turned into a good-looking guy.

536
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,999
Just my luck.

537
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,799
What do you want?

538
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,799
Do you want me to beg?

539
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,119
Sorry...

540
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,039
But I won't make this easier for you.

541
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,839
You don't deserve it.

542
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,879
A toast! Do you want some too?

543
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,199
No. I'm making ice tea.

544
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:12,599
- What to?
- I've got a job.

545
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,679
See?

546
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,879
- I told you so!
- Sanyi is going to help.

547
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,359
- Cheers!
- To Sanyi!

548
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,119
No ice tray?

549
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,079
No.

550
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,159
Show me that!

551
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,159
Is that still here?!

552
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,959
You're too soft!

553
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:44,639
- Oh no, they're old mates.
- They're dubious.

554
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,679
In your position, it's no game!

555
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,319
Where's your necklace?

556
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,959
- What?
- Your necklace.

557
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,679
Oh, I didn't put it on.

558
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,919
It doesn't go with these earrings.

559
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,879
Cheers.

560
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,199
Savings Book

561
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,239
How much is it worth now?

562
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,119
Well...
There's plenty to last us...

563
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,279
for a week.

564
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,199
Come here!

565
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,839
From now on, you do what I say.

566
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:52,199
Tasteful dance music. Positive
message in a cultured environment.

567
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,359
Put this on.

568
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,199
Right.

569
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,199
I hope you know this one.

570
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,919
Is the picture clear?

571
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,919
Mihaly Vaczi:
"Still Not Enough".

572
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,719
It's not enough to fear,
fight the fight instead.

573
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,759
Hello there!

574
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,759
I want a word with you.

575
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:34,279
Have you got any original
Jerry Lee Lewis records?

576
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,679
- Aha.
- Supraphon?

577
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,079
- Sun Records.
- Sun Records?

578
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:42,879
"You ain't gonna make her...

579
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,159
a bong, a bong, bong..."
You got that?

580
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,039
- Frankie Lane, "Jezebel"?
- Sure!

581
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,919
- "Green Fields"?
- I've got them all!

582
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,359
Listen...

583
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:56,759
I've got to have them!
Come here! How much do you want, kid?

584
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,879
- They're not for sale.
- Name your price!

585
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,279
Get lost!

586
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,919
It's not enough to guess
what road lies ahead.

587
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,919
Live in hope and not in dread!

588
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,039
Thank you, congratulations.

589
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,919
And now for the fabulous...

590
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,639
Figaro Band!

591
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,759
What are you going to sing?

592
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,999
A song.

593
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,599
Great!
And what is the song about?

594
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,759
- The unveiling of the Berlin Wall.
- Bravo!

595
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:21,199
Marika, give me one of those!

596
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,039
Is business good?

597
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,639
So-so.

598
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,199
That's the spirit! Cheers!

599
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,919
Thanks. I'll be back in a minute.

600
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,599
Sweetheart, give me another
one of those.

601
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,239
Bravo, kid!

602
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,359
Your father must be proud of you.

603
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:29,919
Here we go!

604
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,199
They call him the Kissin' King
behind his back,

605
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,599
He strolled into town
down an old dirt track.

606
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,919
When he turns his radio on,

607
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,759
The girls in town rush out the salon,

608
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,839
And dance around the king
from dusk till dawn.

609
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,839
I saw him at the movies
the other night,

610
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:01,199
Kissin' a girl and holding her
oh so tight.

611
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,039
Some folks will say that he's a fake,

612
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,799
But the Kissin' King
is a loving mistake.

613
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,919
He kisses girls
and leaves them to shake.

614
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:15,159
- He's the Kissin' King!
- The king! The king!

615
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,679
- He's the Kissin' King!
- The Kissin' King!

616
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,919
He's the Kissin' King!

617
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,839
That's him!

618
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,239
The guitar!

619
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,759
Grab him!

620
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,639
Come on!

621
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,679
Stop this at once!

622
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,919
Let him go!
He hasn't done anything wrong!

623
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,599
What's going on?

624
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,119
We have reports of theft from
seventeen women

625
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:03,039
who had valuables stolen
during intimate relations.

626
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,639
Intimate?
What do you mean, "intimate"?

627
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,999
He kissed the dames
and swiped their stones.

628
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,199
They're just joking, babe.
Can't you see?

629
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,959
What?
Why don't you laugh with us a bit?

630
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:18,879
Hit him again!

631
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,279
Calm down, girls!

632
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,599
He's the Kissin' King!

633
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,039
King! King!

634
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,919
The Kissin' King!

635
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:55,719
If he strolls into a corner bar,

636
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:00,599
The girls come running
from near and far.

637
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,359
But he's so cool,
you know what I mean,

638
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,079
He drops a coin
in the music machine.

639
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:11,079
The Kissin' King dances
with his latest queen.

640
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,759
He runs his fingers
through her silky curls,

641
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:21,839
Around her neck
a gleaming string of pearls.

642
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,079
They stop outside for one more kiss,

643
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,679
But the Kissin' King,
don't miss a thing.

644
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,919
He sure can kiss!
A ring-a-ding-ding!

645
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,359
He's a woman's man,

646
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,359
Doing all he can.

647
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,119
He's a woman's man,

648
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,919
I'm his greatest fan.

649
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:51,759
I just wanna be the Kissin' King!

650
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:27,759
Hey! Miki! Miki! Miki!
Come on! Jump in!

651
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,879
We're celebrating, hey, girls?

652
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,319
What? You monkey!

653
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:38,079
We're through to
the next round, that's all!

654
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,279
Smoke?

655
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,119
Do you know what I want?

656
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,359
You've got no idea!

657
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:53,239
I just want to make music
and fall in love!

658
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:00,119
Rone is right.
The communists should be squashed!

659
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,359
Be careful or they'll squash you!

660
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,839
Do you know what
rock and roll really is?

661
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:12,359
Rock and roll is music, that's all!
You should grow up!

662
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,359
Never!

663
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,599
We'll write a song to your memory.

664
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,239
About what a great musician
you could have been!

665
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,799
If anything happens,
my dad will kill...

666
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,239
- Kill who?
- Us!

667
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:35,759
- If we get caught, what should
we say? - That we found it.

668
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:39,039
I'm gonna piss my pants!

669
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,199
Stop!

670
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,239
Vodka?

671
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,359
- I'm going back!
- No! it's here in my jacket.

672
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,079
That's right! Is it far?

673
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,199
Is it far? it's on the corner!

674
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:14,199
Every night, I see your face,

675
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:20,359
And I watch you every morn.

676
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:26,719
And when I pass you in the park,

677
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:31,679
My heart starts bleeding

678
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,319
because it is torn.

679
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:53,199
I walk the streets lost and alone,

680
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:59,919
'cus I don't have you to call my own.

681
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:06,199
I try so hard to hide my emotions,

682
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,159
But my darling

683
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:15,319
I'm not made of stone.

684
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:22,359
I know now, baby, I need you so,

685
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:27,159
Why did I ever let you go?

686
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:35,919
I want you to be mine forever,

687
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:40,919
Please don't say no!

688
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:51,159
I sit and watch you from time to time,

689
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,919
As you comb your long brown hair.

690
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,079
Do something!

691
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:03,199
Do you care for me my darling?

692
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,199
The piano's on fire!

693
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,759
Or just say the word...

694
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,199
and I'll be gone...

695
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,839
Put it out!

696
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,199
I wanted to be a fireman
when I was a kid.

697
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,919
I can't pee because of my hernia!

698
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:49,359
We did our best.

699
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:53,999
Thanks.

700
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,919
Do you think your dad will notice?

701
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,919
How much did you get for it?

702
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,039
I didn't sell it.

703
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,159
But?

704
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,679
I lost it.

705
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:50,119
You lost a piano?
I see.

706
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:53,119
- Did it fall out of your pocket?
- Darling!

707
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:54,919
Where have you been?

708
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,759
What's the money for?
A woman? Alcohol?

709
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,119
Do you want me to
breathe on you, Dad?

710
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:03,079
- He never drinks!
- What else will you sell?

711
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:06,839
- I guess it'll be
the family clock next... - Clock?

712
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,279
My son is a criminal!
He'll rot in prison!

713
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:15,199
He was serenading!

714
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,239
Doing what?

715
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,799
He was serenading the girl he loves.

716
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,599
You should be proud.

717
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:26,039
Proud? Are you mad?
What is there to be proud of?

718
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:29,759
That he stole the family piano,

719
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,599
dragged it down the street

720
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,959
and threw it in the Danube
like an old bike?!

721
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:37,319
- You serenaded me!
- Me? Out of the question!

722
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:41,919
Zalakaros in the summer of '47.

723
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:46,279
You stood with the hotel band
under my window.

724
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:50,799
You lit candles around the pool,

725
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,759
and you balanced

726
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:58,079
on a blue lilo
in the middle of the pool

727
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,839
- and sang "'Ô Sole Mio".
- Me?

728
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,599
Yes, you!

729
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:08,599
You had to sell your watch and
a pair of shoes to pay for it all.

730
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,199
That wasn't such a sane thing
to do either!

731
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,759
But it was wonderful...

732
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,919
Wonderful!

733
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,959
I'll strangle this woman.

734
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:32,079
If I had,
I'd have served my sentence

735
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:35,359
and I'd be coming out of prison
just as the kid goes in!

736
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,159
Don't be so grumpy!

737
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,879
When was the last time you saw
Karoly Csibi?

738
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:45,359
Who?

739
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,279
I play with this hand...

740
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:57,039
Are you saying you don't know Rone?

741
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,759
Oh, Rone? I know him.

742
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,919
Where is he hiding? Tell me!

743
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,679
Are you deaf?!

744
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,919
Who's hiding him?

745
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:14,919
Has he tried to sell you jewellery?

746
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,039
No.

747
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:21,679
Sadly not.

748
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:28,199
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

749
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,039
Your equipment.

750
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,959
Make way.

751
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,359
Twist, twist, twist!

752
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:45,359
Come on boys and girls,
let's do the twist!

753
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:50,359
I've been working hard
all night and day

754
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,039
Time to throw all my cares away,

755
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,919
Now the weekends here
and it's time to play,

756
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:58,679
Come and join me twisting away!

757
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,879
- Twist, twist!
- Twist, twist, casino twist!

758
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:03,919
- Casino twist!
- Twist, twist, casino twist.

759
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,919
- Twist, twist!
- Twist, twist, casino twist!

760
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,759
I'll show you how it goes.
It's all you need to know!

761
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,239
Slot machines are flashing
in a coffee bar,

762
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,039
I've tried my luck
but never got too far.

763
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,959
But what the hell,
I think I'll have another go

764
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,239
I put the money in,
pull the handle slow.

765
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,999
- Twist, twist...
- Twist, casino twist.

766
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,959
- Casino twist.
- Twist, casino twist.

767
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:29,159
- Twist, twist...
- Twist, casino twist...

768
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:31,839
Come on over baby,
let's do it again!

769
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,839
Miki! isn't that your dad?

770
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,679
- Twist, twist!
- Twist, casino twist.

771
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,919
- Casino twist.
- Twist, twist, casino twist.

772
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:03,199
- Twist, twist.
- Twist, twist, casino twist.

773
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,199
Twist the alphabet,
count one to ten!

774
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,759
Come on, Miki!
Come on, it'll be fine!

775
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,359
What's this dance, kids?

776
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,199
- Is it the rumba?
- Nooo!

777
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,879
- Perhaps the samba?
- Nooo!

778
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:21,759
- Maybe the mambo?
- Nooo!

779
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:23,599
Well, what then?

780
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:27,239
Twist, twist!
Twist, twist, twist, twist!

781
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,639
See you at the hottest place in town,

782
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:34,199
We'll all be there,
just getting down.

783
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:37,199
The pretty girls
will all stand in a queue

784
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,639
There's plenty of me for all of you!

785
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:42,039
- Twist, twist.
- Twist, twist, casino twist.

786
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,119
- Casino twist!
- Twist, twist! Casino twist.

787
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,839
- Twist, twist!
- Twist, twist, casino twist.

788
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,759
There are dances I can list
but none like the twist!

789
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,599
- To the right!
- Twist, twist, a casino twist

790
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,999
- To the left!
- Twist, twist, casino twist!

791
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:59,119
- To the back!
- Twist, twist, casino twist!

792
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:04,959
Twist, twist!

793
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,719
- Puke at home! Get out!
- Run home, kid!

794
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,599
Shit!

795
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,359
We should divide the women up now
so there's no fighting later.

796
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:23,639
- Sure! I'm having Zsofi Winkler!
- Magda Szukits!

797
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,119
Which girl do you want, Miki?

798
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:30,359
- Leave him, he's out of it.
- Vera Miltenyi!

799
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,119
They'd never allow her out.

800
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:35,919
That's my mum's!

801
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:39,759
- Let's go for it, fellas!
- That's the spirit!

802
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,839
Who are you after, Nyiro?

803
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:06,159
- I can't hear!
- Come on out.

804
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,879
Who are you after?

805
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:18,359
Mari Winkler.

806
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:20,999
- Wow!
- Man! Are you sure?

807
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,279
Yes, why?

808
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,999
- You know she likes
to be tortured during sex! - No!

809
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:27,999
- I know.
- He knows.

810
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:31,239
What does that mean?
Should I pull her hair?

811
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:35,319
- No!
- My dad's toolbox is in the pantry.

812
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:37,759
There's Mari!

813
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,879
Hear that, Nyiro?!
Go for it, hard man!

814
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:49,679
Nyiro fancies you!

815
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,679
Hi, Mary!

816
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,079
Want to dance?

817
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:04,639
We could do something better first.

818
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:18,159
Right then...

819
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:22,599
Just cha-cha-cha,

820
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:26,239
That's the task for today.

821
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,679
Yes, cha-cha-cha,

822
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:32,359
Let the rhythm sway.

823
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:36,239
And cha-cha-cha,

824
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:39,759
Now go this way and that way.

825
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,599
...three, four, one, two.
Cha-cha-cha!

826
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,079
Cha-cha-cha,

827
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,279
Do it with passion, hey!

828
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:53,639
I don't care if he's rich or poor,

829
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,719
Bringing diamonds to my door...

830
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:01,119
I don't need no luxury,

831
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:04,079
Just a man who gives me more.

832
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,359
And cha-cha-cha,

833
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:11,679
I just can't stop!

834
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:14,119
I'll cha-cha-cha,

835
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,359
Until I drop!

836
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:28,639
Oh, cha-cha-cha!

837
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:37,679
In the street,
or in the bar,

838
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,159
If you're a star or just who you are.

839
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:45,599
Dance with me and we'll go far.

840
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,639
Come on baby! Ooh and ah!

841
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,719
Just cha-cha-cha,

842
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:55,759
It's the dance we all want to do.

843
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:57,599
Hey, cha-cha-cha,

844
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,639
It's for me and you.

845
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:07,159
I don't need nothing from my school,

846
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:10,639
Only the cha-cha is cool!

847
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:15,079
Don't be a square,
don't be a fool,

848
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:18,159
it makes me so hot
'cus it's so cool!

849
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,319
Oh, cha-cha-cha,

850
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:25,039
I just can't stop!

851
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:29,799
I'll cha-cha-cha
until I drop.

852
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,959
If this turns you on...

853
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,359
Get out, you bastard!

854
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,879
You animal!

855
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,679
That animal climbed on me
and sawed my ponytail off!

856
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:52,759
You told me to! You bastards!

857
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,039
It suits you.

858
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:12,079
Rone! Rone's here!

859
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,359
- Hi!
- Where the hell were you?

860
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:16,999
We thought you'd defected!

861
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:18,679
American kid!

862
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,919
Have you got a fan club now?

863
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:25,039
- You really are a big man now!
- Hi.

864
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,079
Hi.

865
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,359
What's this?

866
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:31,759
Rick Nelson!

867
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,999
- Rone!
- Catch it, kid!

868
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:37,239
It's all in the wrist action!

869
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:38,879
Give it back!

870
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:42,639
Tripolisz!
Don't let a girl tell you what to do!

871
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,079
If you break it, you pay for it!

872
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:52,959
Thanks.

873
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:56,799
What's this, babe?
Are you dating the slime-ball?

874
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,639
What's it to do with you?

875
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,919
- Arsehole!
- What?

876
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:07,719
Has the American kid got you now too?

877
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:11,319
What does he give you
so you'll kiss his arse?

878
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:15,679
Sura! Chewing gum?

879
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:19,959
You bend over for this spy
for a packet of gum?

880
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:21,879
Miki isn't a grass!

881
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,719
Not a grass?

882
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:27,359
Why do you think the Yanks
sent them home?

883
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:28,839
Why not?

884
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:34,919
Tripo!
You can't be that stupid!

885
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:39,239
They sent them home because
they were spying for the commies.

886
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,199
Has the penny dropped?

887
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,759
- You're an idiot!
- Get off!

888
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,679
Why does he kiss Bigali's arse?

889
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:51,719
He sings with East German sluts
rather than us!

890
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:54,759
How do you think they came
back home with no trouble?

891
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,359
That's true.

892
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:02,039
You got your flat back and your jobs.

893
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,359
That's not true.

894
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:06,079
Back into the interior Ministry!

895
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:07,839
The Ministry of industry.

896
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,119
So it was industrial espionage!

897
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:13,359
- We really don't know about his dad.
- Fuck off, Nyiro!

898
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:19,159
I know you grassed me up,
you monkey!

899
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,119
Hi, Vera!

900
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:24,319
Both him and his dad are grasses.

901
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,719
Hi, guys.
ls the party still going?

902
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,799
Vera!

903
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,599
Vera! Vera!

904
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:37,879
Vera! I'm sorry...
I didn't mean to.

905
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:43,119
Rings of fire...

906
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:46,119
before my eyes,

907
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:49,919
My heart is burning for the prize.

908
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:52,599
This love we have can't be denied,

909
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,359
I fell for you on a Saturday night!

910
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:57,919
You're the only one I want,

911
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:00,599
You're the only one I need.

912
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:03,159
Do I really have to plead?

913
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:10,119
My heart stops
still when you look at me!

914
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,599
I saw you at the local hop,

915
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,159
And you brought me a soda-pop,

916
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,759
I know now that I've reached the top,

917
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:24,239
One taste of you
and I just can't stop!

918
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,799
You're the only one I want,

919
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,599
You're the only one I need.

920
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,999
Do I really have to plead?

921
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:37,599
My heart stops
still when you look at me!

922
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:40,199
Vera!

923
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:44,799
Is everything okay?

924
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:57,199
Kid!

925
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,759
What are you doing?

926
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:06,679
Watch out because it's brand-new!

927
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:20,719
Do you want some gum?

928
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:58,679
Watch out because it's brand-new!

929
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,319
What's up, kid?

930
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,199
Need any help?

931
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:12,599
No thanks, I can manage!

932
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:33,919
Don't need words
when our love is true,

933
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,679
Somehow I guess I always knew,

934
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:39,039
It's you for me and me for you,

935
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:41,759
Stay with me the whole night through!

936
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,879
You're the only one I want,

937
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,839
You're the only one I need,

938
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,199
Do I really have to plead?

939
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:55,599
My heart stops
still when you look at me!

940
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:07,599
My heart stops...

941
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,959
My heart stops!

942
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:25,239
Stop!
You're under arrest!

943
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:28,839
Stop!

944
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,279
Thank you!

945
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:57,759
Listen to me!

946
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:02,279
If I see you near my daughter again,
I'll cut your balls off!

947
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,119
Where did you screw the dames?

948
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:37,359
Hands behind your back!

949
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:39,839
Is the record stuck?

950
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,999
Where are the necklaces?

951
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,839
I'm in no hurry...

952
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:11,239
Won't you give me one, boss?

953
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:16,319
Give him one!

954
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,359
Stop that!

955
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:27,359
What good will all this do?

956
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:30,639
Relax, kid,
you can go home soon!

957
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:34,319
Relax, kid,

958
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:36,279
you'll go home soon!

959
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,719
Fucking bastard!

960
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:54,999
Your dad will be shocked when
he sees what his comrades did.

961
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:07,919
When the Cuban missile crisis erupted,

962
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:11,759
the CIA reviewed
all recent immigrants.

963
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:14,679
They found out my father
had been a Party member.

964
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:18,199
We were given 48 hours
to leave the country.

965
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,359
We hung around in Manchester
for 6 months.

966
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:26,199
It took that long to arrange
to come home and not get locked up.

967
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:28,999
Do you know
what he did before we left?

968
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,199
He was an engineer.

969
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:32,719
And now...

970
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,359
he's a bus conductor!

971
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:38,359
A bus conductor...

972
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:42,839
Bus conductor! Great!

973
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:54,159
I only wanted to live a normal life

974
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:59,999
and to break out of this leper colony.

975
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:06,919
I wanted to have a flat and a car.

976
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:15,039
Look at Marina.

977
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:19,919
She's a first-class girl, hey?

978
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,799
So sweet...

979
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,879
Should I take her home to my dad?

980
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:33,879
To my alcoholic dad in a basement?

981
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:41,679
In a land where these thugs
dictate the morals,

982
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:45,999
I want to be the biggest gangster.

983
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:55,199
Take the band.

984
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:06,599
But with your own songs!

985
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:13,759
You're good at this game.

986
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,039
You really are.

987
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:25,039
Driving a Chevrolet down the streets
of Budapest lined with palm trees.

988
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:31,199
You're right.

989
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,759
That's what's needed here.

990
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:39,079
Pretend it's America.

991
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:42,799
Pretend we live normal lives.

992
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:14,359
It wasn't easy to get you out
but I organised it.

993
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:16,359
Thanks.

994
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:18,759
It was nothing!

995
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:22,239
The finals are just
around the corner, hey, Miki?

996
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:39,079
Seven o'clock tonight
in your Sunday best.

997
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,119
We can go.

998
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:53,679
Sorry...

999
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:22,359
You didn't steal from me!

1000
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:24,759
Why didn't you steal from me?

1001
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:29,599
I only steal from the wives
of wealthy communists.

1002
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:32,159
Look at me!

1003
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:35,159
Look into my eyes, Karcsi.

1004
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,639
What did you come here for?

1005
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:45,359
What for?

1006
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,119
What do you think?

1007
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:50,679
Let's finish it, baby.

1008
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:55,319
Find yourself another guy.

1009
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:01,679
- You'll be a granny when I get out!
- They've got no proof.

1010
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,919
They'll find the gear sooner or later.

1011
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:11,239
Where is it?

1012
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:19,679
- It's better if you
don't get involved. - Where is it?

1013
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:50,959
Search the place!

1014
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:56,759
What's the problem?
ls there a problem?

1015
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:32,919
I'll be back for
the car tomorrow, Karcsi.

1016
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:52,119
My name's Gyula.

1017
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:48,879
Ah, bambina!

1018
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:52,199
- You came then!
- Hi, Brenner!

1019
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:55,119
Impress me.

1020
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:12,079
Cool!

1021
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:06,079
Hi, babe.

1022
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,759
You look great.

1023
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:22,359
There is something left, hey?

1024
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,759
Aha.

1025
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:34,359
But... no more rock and roll.

1026
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,359
Hi!

1027
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,279
Come on, hurry up, son!

1028
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:53,159
I've got some good news
but don't get too excited.

1029
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:56,919
- It looks like I'm on the jury!
- Dad!

1030
01:30:57,160 --> 01:31:01,119
Calm down. You still have
to work hard. Especially you!

1031
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:03,999
Because I'll knock your block off.

1032
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,159
Okay then. Kiss!

1033
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:11,679
Und ja, und schon, und alles...

1034
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:13,999
Gehen!

1035
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:18,759
Miki!

1036
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,839
- Hi! They let you out?
- Yes!

1037
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:24,079
- And Rone too?
- No, not him.

1038
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:29,079
Come on, Miki!

1039
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:35,199
Bye!

1040
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:42,919
Sorry!

1041
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:45,759
Good evening!

1042
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,919
Sorry!

1043
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:49,359
This way!

1044
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:15,359
We are now going to
a live broadcast...

1045
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:22,279
Ladies and gentlemen,

1046
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:27,199
welcome to the final of Hungarian
Television's talent contest.

1047
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:31,159
This exciting series
has now reached its climax,

1048
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:35,919
when the youth of Hungary can
eventually respond to the challenge of:

1049
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:37,839
"Show What You Know"!

1050
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:40,599
Let the show commence.

1051
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:43,199
First in the folk music category

1052
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:47,759
we have the
Pecel Endeavour Zither Ensemble.

1053
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:20,359
- How was your day?
- Fabulous!

1054
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:27,239
The first on stage to recite a poem
is Vera Miltenyi from Budapest.

1055
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:36,279
Mihaly Vaczi:
"Still Not Enough"

1056
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:41,759
it's not enough to fear,
fight the fight instead.

1057
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:46,719
It's not enough to flicker,
but burn with flames of red.

1058
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:53,359
It's not enough to talk,
but say what's not been said.

1059
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:57,039
It is not enough to sense,

1060
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:06,719
you have to know instead.

1061
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:12,759
It's not enough to journey,
but walk where others dare not tread.

1062
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:16,599
You have to set out first,
along the road ahead.

1063
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:21,599
One man is not enough,
others must be led.

1064
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:26,039
And only those should lead,
who are for leading bred.

1065
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:32,679
Goodwill is not enough,
it takes a stronger head.

1066
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:35,199
But is a head enough?

1067
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:39,199
No, it needs a heart to spread

1068
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:44,319
the message of this verse,
of pain and passion true.

1069
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,079
To strive for a better life,

1070
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:53,079
a life for me and you.

1071
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:00,759
It's not enough to guess...

1072
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:10,079
it's not enough to guess
what road lies ahead.

1073
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:26,599
Thank you for
that wonderful rendition.

1074
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:34,759
- Have we got the bathroom yet?
- Five more minutes, sweetheart.

1075
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,599
Now, in the dance music category,

1076
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,959
a true international delight

1077
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:47,079
combining the best of Hungarian
and East German talent.

1078
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:50,759
All the way from 13th District:
Figaro!

1079
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:00,079
I know them.

1080
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:03,719
Miki! Where is that...?

1081
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:05,759
Miki!

1082
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:13,279
Stupid kid!

1083
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:43,999
Fantastic, thank you!

1084
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:45,959
It's going to be tough for the jury.

1085
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:47,199
Points please!

1086
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:48,599
Seven.

1087
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:49,999
Six.

1088
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:51,039
Eight.

1089
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:52,919
Five.

1090
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:55,999
A can't see Arpad Bigali's points.

1091
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:59,359
Ten! Thank you!

1092
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:02,199
We only have one more winner to pick.

1093
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:05,119
And that's in
the dance music category.

1094
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:07,359
And now for our last performers...

1095
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:06,359
Roll on up the rug tonight
'cus we're dancing!

1096
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:08,759
Come on roll it up right now!

1097
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:13,719
It's gonna be a night for romancing,
don't worry I'll show you how!

1098
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:16,319
Turn the lights down low,
open the piano,

1099
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:18,919
Forget all about that
"quick, quick, slow"!

1100
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:21,919
Tonight we're gonna rumble,
sing loud and don't mumble,

1101
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:24,119
Come on roll the rug up now!

1102
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:30,079
Can we join you?

1103
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:41,839
Everybody's sleeping,
no need for creeping

1104
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,239
around in the street outside.

1105
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,999
It's quiet in the town square.
No need to play fair.

1106
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:49,079
There's nothing we've got to hide.

1107
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:51,239
The neighbours can all just hang.

1108
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:54,599
Play the drum with a bang, bang, bang!

1109
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:56,759
What the hell do we care?
They can all come and stare!

1110
01:39:57,080 --> 01:39:59,719
Come on roll the rug up now!

1111
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:04,199
I've waited all my life
for this night to come,

1112
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:09,279
Smoking, drinking beer
and chewing gum!

1113
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:11,999
The place is ours to do as we want,

1114
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:14,839
So say you will and
don't say that you won't.

1115
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:19,679
Come on, darling,
you're the only one!

1116
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:22,239
Roll on up the rug tonight
'cus we're dancing!

1117
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,679
Come on roll it up right now!

1118
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:29,359
It's gonna be a night for romancing,
don't you worry I'll show you how!

1119
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:31,919
Turn the lights down low,
open the piano,

1120
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:34,879
Forget all about that
"quick, quick, slow"!

1121
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:37,359
Tonight we're gonna rumble,
sing loud and don't mumble,

1122
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:40,599
Come on roll the rug up now!

1123
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:04,999
Thank you.

1124
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:09,599
And that was?

1125
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:13,679
Isn't that your son?

1126
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:14,719
Yes, he is!

1127
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:19,239
The Hungaria Band!

1128
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:22,159
Jury, points please!

1129
01:41:25,640 --> 01:41:26,719
10 points.

1130
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:29,839
10 points, 10 points...

1131
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:32,119
And another 10...

1132
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:36,279
10 points.

1133
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:40,239
Fantastic.
Let's see the last score.

1134
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:42,039
If it's more than five...

1135
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:44,359
Zero?

1136
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:46,119
What?

1137
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:06,759
Ten points!

1138
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:10,799
And so Hungaria are the winners!

1139
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:16,879
That's cold!

1140
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:31,599
- Sandor, what are you doing?
- What's going on?

1141
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:33,839
I told you, I'd cut your balls off!

1142
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:38,039
"May I enter with
new songs for a new age?"

1143
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:42,679
Yes, of course...
in a cultured environment.

1144
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:48,279
That's our kind of rock and roll!
Congratulations, son!

1145
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:50,919
Thank you!

1146
01:43:51,120 --> 01:43:53,319
Your poem was wonderful!

1147
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:55,759
Let's have a drink!

1148
01:43:57,800 --> 01:43:58,679
Good evening.

1149
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:00,039
Evening.

1150
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:03,359
Mum!

1151
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:05,879
The light!

1152
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,919
Made in Hungaria,

1153
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:13,919
My only mania.

1154
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:19,599
Where music played and dance
floors swayed to a new melodia.

1155
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:26,079
With a shiny new guitar
I brought rhythms from afar,

1156
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:29,359
The flame caught light
and still burns bright.

1157
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:31,359
Why did I wander?

1158
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:34,599
Then my heart caught fire,

1159
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:37,199
And took us all much higher.

1160
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:39,319
Now or never!

1161
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:49,639
We were all filled with hope,
but life's a slippery slope,

1162
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:55,599
So along with the rest,
I soon learned to cope.

1163
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:58,599
Hungary my home,

1164
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:01,639
The one place that's my own.

1165
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:07,119
But now I'm back there’s noway
I'll roam.

1166
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:10,719
Made in Hungaria,

1167
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:13,919
My only mania.

1168
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:18,599
It's been so good to me
my lovely Hungary.

1169
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:22,919
I've been to the USA,

1170
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:25,919
And heard how they play,

1171
01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:31,919
I brought it home to my home town
to sing my own way.

1172
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:34,919
Because the only way I know,

1173
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:37,999
Was to stay and not to go,

1174
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:43,639
My homeland may be small
but I love it so.

1175
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:46,599
It's only when your

1176
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:49,319
roots are strong

1177
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:51,879
that you can ever grow.

1178
01:46:55,840 --> 01:47:01,359
We are all filled with hope,
but life's a slippery slope,

1179
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:07,359
So along with the rest,
we soon learn to cope.

1180
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:10,799
Hungaria my home,

1181
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,719
The one place that's my own.

1182
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:19,599
But now I'm back there's no way
I'll roam.

1183
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:22,359
Made in Hungaria,

1184
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:25,599
Not all agree,

1185
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:30,799
But it's been good to me
my lovely Hungary.

1186
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:38,279
I've had my finger on the beat
of the pulse of the street.

1187
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:44,199
'Cus rock and roll is the school
of knocks that keeps you on your feet.

1188
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:49,199
But the rewards are always sweet.

1189
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:04,879
Made in Hungaria.

1190
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:19,639
You are all filled with hope,
but life's a slippery slope,

1191
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:25,639
But along with the rest,
you'll soon learn to cope.

1192
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:28,759
Hungary my home,

1193
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:31,759
The one place that's my own,

1194
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:37,239
I'm back to stay,
there's no way I'll roam.

1195
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:40,719
Made in Hungaria,

1196
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:43,959
It's a magic mania.

1197
01:48:44,240 --> 01:48:48,759
And it's been so good to me
my lovely Hungary.

1198
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:52,719
Made in Hungaria,

1199
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:55,959
It's a magic mania.

1200
01:48:56,240 --> 01:49:00,799
And it's been so good to me
my lovely Hungary.
