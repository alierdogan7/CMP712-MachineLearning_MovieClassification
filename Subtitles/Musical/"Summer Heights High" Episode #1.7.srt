1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,960
I've got Year 9s first period.
God help me.

2
00:00:09,995 --> 00:00:11,525
Mmm.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,180
With the blonde hair?

4
00:00:13,215 --> 00:00:14,765
What are you doing today?

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,205
Um... today.
Tonight I was in a movie.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,880
One of my big gripes
is there's a lot of teasing

7
00:00:20,915 --> 00:00:22,325
that goes on at this school.

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,640
Kids are very nasty. And Toby
deals with a lot of that stuff.

9
00:00:25,675 --> 00:00:29,000
He has to deal with being called,
"You spaz".

10
00:00:29,035 --> 00:00:32,005
"You retard". "Spastic".

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,125
Um, what else do you get?
"Nuff nuff".

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,365
And I know how he feels.
I had a difficult school time myself.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,040
I went to an all-boys school, and
I went by my real name in those days,

14
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,525
which is Helen -

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,560
the ancient Greek
masculine version of the name.

16
00:00:46,595 --> 00:00:49,725
And you can imagine
at at boys' school,

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,485
with a name like Helen Gregson,
it was not easy.

18
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,240
Getting called things. " Oh, you big poof,
Helen. You 're a poofter."

19
00:00:56,275 --> 00:00:58,640
And I used to wear my pants
fairly high in those days

20
00:00:58,675 --> 00:01:00,240
'cause I was a dancer and...

21
00:01:00,275 --> 00:01:01,685
Pretty funny.
Mmm.

22
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,845
Dance... that's just how
we wore them then.

23
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,640
So, " Helen, stop pulling
your pants up, you big poof."

24
00:01:07,675 --> 00:01:09,837
Nasty things like that.

25
00:01:09,872 --> 00:01:11,965
So I know how it feels.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes. We look after each other,
don't we?

27
00:01:15,035 --> 00:01:17,037
Yeah.
We do.

28
00:01:17,072 --> 00:01:18,772
Just... Alright.

29
00:01:18,807 --> 00:01:20,473
And release.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,445
Did you lock the car?

31
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,245
Course I fucking locked it.

32
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,077
Don't talk to me
like that, you little fuck.

33
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,920
Don't walk next to me. It looks gay.

34
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,960
So is he back on the Ritalin?
Yeah.

35
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:05,725
OK. Well, that can help.

36
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,605
And, Jonah, have you had time

37
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,760
to think things over
during the suspension?

38
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:11,605
Answer your teacher.

39
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,097
He's not my teacher,
he's student welfare.

40
00:02:14,132 --> 00:02:16,554
Any sort of changes
that you could make?

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,560
Be better at school.

42
00:02:19,595 --> 00:02:21,085
And be more behaved.

43
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,605
What about at home,
Mr Takalua?

44
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,757
Is there anything you can change
to help Jonah get through all this?

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,840
Be stricter on him.
Make him do his work.

46
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,937
And smack him out if he doesn't.

47
00:02:32,972 --> 00:02:34,965
Well, not really changes like that.

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,440
I was thinking more of doing some
reading together in the evenings.

49
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:40,960
Yeah, maybe.
That's a homo thing to do.

50
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:42,697
I'm not doing that, sir.

51
00:02:42,732 --> 00:02:44,365
Alright, what about the work

52
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,118
you were supposed to do
during your suspension?

53
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,440
Jonah, what subject was this for?

54
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:56,685
I don't know.

55
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,280
Well, what teacher gave it to you?

56
00:02:59,315 --> 00:03:00,765
Mr Poulos.

57
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,725
The science teacher.
Yeah.

58
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,200
We went and buy the glue for it
and he works hard on it.

59
00:03:06,235 --> 00:03:08,005
Yeah, I can see he worked hard on it.

60
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,400
But I'm afraid to tell you
this is not school work.

61
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:11,833
A suspension isn't a holiday, Jonah.

62
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,440
Do you really wanna go to
a fourth school in two years?

63
00:03:16,475 --> 00:03:18,112
No, sir.
No, I didn't think so.

64
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,205
Holly. Oh, my God.

65
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,240
Did you get my text?
Is it a formal issue?

66
00:03:25,275 --> 00:03:27,356
Formal issue. Guys, formal issue.

67
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,680
So, the DJ called me last night
and says there's no way he's doing it

68
00:03:32,715 --> 00:03:34,937
unless we give him
full payment up-front.

69
00:03:34,972 --> 00:03:37,125
Yeah, it's, like, five grand.

70
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,960
So just tell him we don't have it.
I told him. He got really mad.

71
00:03:39,995 --> 00:03:42,760
It's a serious issue, guys.
It's, like, the biggest part of it.

72
00:03:42,795 --> 00:03:44,565
When I said I was gonna plan a formal

73
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,400
I didn't realise that you guys
would be too povo to pay for it.

74
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,005
We've sold, like, three tickets.
I know.

75
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,120
So, as of today, Jonah,
we're gonna implement some changes.

76
00:03:57,155 --> 00:03:59,045
You are now on parole.

77
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,560
That means one tiny thing and
there are big, big consequences.

78
00:04:04,595 --> 00:04:07,617
And first of all, we're gonna
ban you from breakdancing,

79
00:04:07,652 --> 00:04:10,640
because breakdancing is the cause
of a lot of your issues.

80
00:04:10,675 --> 00:04:12,085
That's bullshit, sir.

81
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,360
Jonah, every time you get into
a fight, it's about breakdancing.

82
00:04:16,395 --> 00:04:17,925
It's a waste of time.
It's fucked up.

83
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,480
One time you get caught breakdancing
and you are out of here.

84
00:04:21,515 --> 00:04:25,000
Well, if he fucks up again
I'm gonna send him back to Tonga.

85
00:04:25,035 --> 00:04:26,800
How would you feel about that, Jonah?

86
00:04:26,835 --> 00:04:28,233
I'd feel bad.

87
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,040
I don't wanna go to Tonga.
I'd miss my friends.

88
00:04:32,075 --> 00:04:33,925
I'll miss this school.
Mmm.

89
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,760
I went to Tonga once
when I was 10, and it was shit.

90
00:04:36,795 --> 00:04:39,477
Alright. So don't break the rules.

91
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:42,160
Do you understand that?
Yeah.

92
00:04:42,195 --> 00:04:43,805
Good.

93
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,205
How about, um... just an idea -

94
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,840
we could, like,
maybe buy our own tickets.

95
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,405
No, we are not
buying our own tickets.

96
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,440
We're on the formal committee.
We've done so much work.

97
00:04:51,475 --> 00:04:54,240
Yeah, we've done way too much work.
No way.

98
00:04:54,275 --> 00:04:56,397
Oh, my God. I just
thought of an idea.

99
00:04:56,432 --> 00:04:58,476
What?
We could do, like, a fundraiser.

100
00:04:58,511 --> 00:05:00,485
I've done heaps of it.
I know what to do.

101
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,720
No, seriously, like, we'll do,
like, a dress-up day -

102
00:05:02,755 --> 00:05:04,357
like, a theme dress-up day, right?

103
00:05:04,392 --> 00:05:05,925
And everyone has to bring, like, $2.

104
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,765
It will be so cool.

105
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,485
Five bucks.
Five bucks!

106
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,400
And five bucks times the whole school
is, like, 20,000 bucks or something.

107
00:05:13,435 --> 00:05:15,845
And we could do
a fashion parade.

108
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,685
Like, $10 at the door.
I love fashion parades!

109
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,440
And we'll do... like, we'll set up
a little catwalk in a classroom.

110
00:05:21,475 --> 00:05:24,160
And I can bring in all my designer
clothes and you guys can wear them!

111
00:05:24,195 --> 00:05:25,445
Yeah!

112
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,300
That's, like, paid for our formal.

113
00:05:27,335 --> 00:05:29,085
Let's go tell Mr Cameron.
Oh, my God.

114
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,315
I'll do an announcement at assembly.
It will be so cool.

115
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,680
Thank you, Rosie.

116
00:05:41,715 --> 00:05:43,125
Pop those down there.

117
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,440
Greg, could I have a word with you
in my office, if you wouldn't mind?

118
00:05:46,475 --> 00:05:47,885
Yes.

119
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,320
I'm sorry to hear about your dog.
It's obviously quite upsetting.

120
00:05:51,355 --> 00:05:52,525
Yes, it is.

121
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,405
The reason I want to talk to you

122
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,660
is to tell you that
Meredith's finalised

123
00:05:56,695 --> 00:05:58,880
all her family affairs
in New Zealand

124
00:05:58,915 --> 00:06:01,512
and she'll be here on Friday.

125
00:06:01,547 --> 00:06:04,110
As what?
As head of drama.

126
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,080
We don't need a head of drama.
I'm the director of performing arts.

127
00:06:09,115 --> 00:06:11,837
You have been outstanding -
I can't thank you enough for filling in,

128
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,560
and I'll be putting something
in the newsletter - but Meredith...

129
00:06:14,595 --> 00:06:16,365
No, I'm the director
of performing arts.

130
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,405
Look, Meredith will be back
as the head of drama

131
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,557
and you 'll be returning
to being a senior drama teacher.

132
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,440
When am I getting my arena seating...
for the show?

133
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:30,045
When are you... when are you...

134
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,960
...opening up your budget and giving
a little bit to Drama for once?

135
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:36,920
When am I getting... when am I
getting my basketball hoop down?

136
00:06:36,955 --> 00:06:38,645
When am I getting
some support from you?

137
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,880
Instead, you 're wasting it
on sport and cricket stumps

138
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:44,965
and stupid things
that the school doesn't need.

139
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,040
Why don't you go buy some more books
for the library or crap like that?

140
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,680
Because the funds are certainly not
coming in my direction.

141
00:06:50,715 --> 00:06:52,317
Greg, don't be ridiculous.

142
00:06:52,352 --> 00:06:53,885
I am greatly supportive of you

143
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,005
and I've appreciated
all that you 've done.

144
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,080
You 're not a supporter of me.
You don't support me.

145
00:06:58,115 --> 00:06:59,525
If you supported me,

146
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,560
you wouldn't have the special ed kids
in the demountables

147
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:03,560
on the site where you know
I want to build

148
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:05,040
the Gregson Performing Arts Centre.

149
00:07:05,075 --> 00:07:06,485
That's not supportive.

150
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,395
Greg, I have to consider
other departments in the school,

151
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,271
and, from where I stand,
Drama is a small department.

152
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,965
Well, you need to give me
a chance to make it big.

153
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,080
Once I've finished the show,
then build the performing arts centre.

154
00:07:22,115 --> 00:07:25,197
The kids will be coming in droves,
you know that.

155
00:07:25,232 --> 00:07:28,280
And I need your help.
I don't need... Meredith.

156
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,405
Greg, I understand
what you 're saying,

157
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,040
but I've been in the public school
system for over 30 years now

158
00:07:34,075 --> 00:07:36,405
and I know what the funding is like.

159
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,600
Your performing arts centre
is a fabulous idea,

160
00:07:39,635 --> 00:07:41,557
but it is not realistic.

161
00:07:41,592 --> 00:07:43,445
It's never going to happen.

162
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,472
Let me do my show
and I will get you that money.

163
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,805
I need you to help me

164
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,990
instead of putting up walls.

165
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,592
I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.

166
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,160
I'm so sick of you. I'm so...
I'm sick of this stupid school.

167
00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:03,605
And you 're all pathetic.

168
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,285
I've built that drama department up

169
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,165
from the shithole that it was
when I came here

170
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,080
and you 've never... you 've never
appreciated me for doing that.

171
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,525
You 've never thanked me.

172
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,200
You 've never said, " Greg,
thank you for what you 've done."

173
00:08:15,235 --> 00:08:17,005
You know, I could have taken
a different road.

174
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,640
I could have been huge by now if I'd
taken a different path in my life.

175
00:08:20,675 --> 00:08:22,845
I could have been famous.
I would have been massive.

176
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,320
Instead I've just chosen to
waste my time in a pathetic school

177
00:08:26,355 --> 00:08:28,880
with loser teachers
and idiots like you.

178
00:08:28,915 --> 00:08:30,565
And I'm so sick of it.

179
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,240
You 're pathetic. I'm better than
all of you people out there.

180
00:08:33,275 --> 00:08:34,753
I'm better than all of you.

181
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,605
I try to bring a little bit of hope,

182
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,080
a little bit of magic into the school
and I get a...

183
00:08:40,115 --> 00:08:41,525
I try to have a dream.

184
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,600
I dare to have a dream that's big
and you shove it in my face.

185
00:08:44,635 --> 00:08:46,165
I get it slapped back in my face.

186
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,031
"No, it's not possible.
We can't do that."

187
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,405
Shoot me for wanting to... to dream.

188
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,560
Shoot me for giving the kids
something to aspire to.

189
00:08:53,595 --> 00:08:55,360
I'm bloody resigning.
I'm so sick of it.

190
00:08:55,395 --> 00:08:57,080
Shove it up your arse, Margaret.

191
00:08:57,115 --> 00:08:59,045
I'm resigning, everyone.

192
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,230
I'm out of here. That's it. I'm gone.

193
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,725
There's my letter of resignation.

194
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,458
And there's some flowers
for my dead dog.

195
00:09:05,493 --> 00:09:07,157
Why don't you stick those
up your fat arse?!

196
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,200
Fuck off, everyone!

197
00:09:10,235 --> 00:09:11,633
I'm gone.

198
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,660
We got kicked out
of our old area.

199
00:09:20,695 --> 00:09:23,085
Now we're in this shit area.

200
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,925
Yeah, we've got a fucked-up ground.

201
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,205
There's no audience
when we breakdance.

202
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,640
No-one ever comes down here.
It's so boring, man.

203
00:09:29,675 --> 00:09:31,085
Come on, man.
I can't do it.

204
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,000
Come on, no teachers
can see from here.

205
00:09:33,035 --> 00:09:34,485
I'll get busted if I do it.

206
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,360
Since the fight, like, we don't even
talk to the Year 7 s anymore, man.

207
00:09:37,395 --> 00:09:40,200
We don't even... it's like they
don't... they're not even there, bro.

208
00:09:40,235 --> 00:09:42,800
We don't even look at them.
Especially Keiran.

209
00:09:42,835 --> 00:09:44,245
He's a fucker.

210
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,085
He made up
this all-Aussie crew

211
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,480
and he's going around telling people
that his crew's better than us.

212
00:09:50,515 --> 00:09:52,437
It's crap.
Bro, he's racist.

213
00:09:52,472 --> 00:09:54,325
He only lets Aussies in it.

214
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,680
And Aussies are shit breakdancers.
Bloody Aussies.

215
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,318
The All-Aussie Breakdancing Crew's
made up of me, Liam

216
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,996
and a couple of other guys
I'm teaching breakdance.

217
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,880
The only rule is that
you have to be Aussie to be in it,

218
00:10:09,915 --> 00:10:11,325
so no wogs or fobs.

219
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,805
And our year level coordinator,
Miss Wheatley,

220
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,840
said we can breakdance
at the end-of-term assembly.

221
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:15,880
So we're practising.

222
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,765
Hi, miss!

223
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,445
Oh, man, when Jonah
was away, the Year 7 s,

224
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,740
they wrote all this racist shit
on Jonah's locker.

225
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:24,965
Yeah, like, "Go home, fobs,"
and shit like that.

226
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,965
Keiran wrote it.
And saying, "Go back to Samoa."

227
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,325
Keiran fucking wrote it.
He's denying it, but he wrote it.

228
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,820
No, it wasn't us. We don't know
who did it, but. It wasn't us, but.

229
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:37,280
They probably did it themselves
to make it look like we did it.

230
00:10:37,315 --> 00:10:39,245
Yeah. They're stupid enough
to do that.

231
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,920
And I know if I take revenge on him
and smash him or some shit,

232
00:10:42,955 --> 00:10:44,365
that I'll get busted for it.

233
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,478
I'll get blamed for it
and then I'll have...

234
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,556
<i>... I'll get fucking expelled
or some shit.</i>

235
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,060
And now for a quick message
from Jamie King.

236
00:10:52,095 --> 00:10:54,607
I'm just about
to make my announcement

237
00:10:54,642 --> 00:10:57,085
about the fundraiser for the formal.

238
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,925
I've done heaps of
this kind of stuff before

239
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,760
and the key thing is
to make people feel really guilty.

240
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:04,365
AIDS is a huge problem in Africa.

241
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,480
People are dying
of AIDS every second.

242
00:11:06,515 --> 00:11:07,925
It's really bad.

243
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,580
So on Thursday we'll be having
a dress-up day

244
00:11:10,615 --> 00:11:13,200
to raise important funds
for AIDS in Africa.

245
00:11:13,235 --> 00:11:14,645
Going with the AIDS thing

246
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,120
means that people are more likely
to give money,

247
00:11:17,155 --> 00:11:18,805
'cause they're gonna feel really bad.

248
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,640
Like, if I just said it was for
the formal, like, they wouldn't care.

249
00:11:21,675 --> 00:11:23,085
Do you know what I mean?

250
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,200
The dress-up theme is AIDS, so come
dressed as an AIDS-related thing,

251
00:11:27,235 --> 00:11:30,200
like a doctor, a nurse,
a patient or an African.

252
00:11:30,235 --> 00:11:32,080
Also there's gonna be
a fashion parade

253
00:11:32,115 --> 00:11:33,840
in the multipurpose room at lunch,

254
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,337
and it's $10 to get in.

255
00:11:35,372 --> 00:11:36,765
Thank you, everyone.

256
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,365
I don't really
see it as lying.

257
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,960
It's, like, just delaying
telling them the truth about it.

258
00:11:41,995 --> 00:11:43,393
Do you know what I mean?

259
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,400
Well, I'm leaving
at the end of today.

260
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:50,445
I'm really going. I'm ready.

261
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,320
Can you make sure we're going
in some sort of order with this?

262
00:11:54,355 --> 00:11:56,325
I'm doing
the whole farewell thing.

263
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,605
Guys, I'm gonna be
handing round my card.

264
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,880
I've got the whole staff
signing one of those...

265
00:12:00,915 --> 00:12:02,325
<i>... the big, oversized cards</i>

266
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,840
that I went and got at recess
from the newsagent.

267
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,840
The card's on its way round, so...

268
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,405
What are you gonna write?

269
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,445
So everyone's wishing me well,
which is very nice.

270
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,720
Sorry, I don't know you very well.
Can I get you to sign this, please?

271
00:12:14,755 --> 00:12:16,245
Um, everyone's talking about it.

272
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,880
There's a lot of talk
around the school.

273
00:12:17,915 --> 00:12:19,445
Listening, please, everyone.

274
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,440
It is my last day today -
Mr G's last day at school -

275
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,645
so if you have anything
you want to say to me

276
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,640
then come and talk to me now
in the playground - here.

277
00:12:27,675 --> 00:12:29,285
I've let the whole school know.

278
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,920
Um, I've said goodbye
to good friends.

279
00:12:30,955 --> 00:12:32,365
OK, off you go.

280
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,045
I've gone around
to my favourite teachers.

281
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,360
I'm not gonna say goodbye to
everyone - I don't like everyone.

282
00:12:36,395 --> 00:12:37,925
Go and get the rubbish.
No, Mr G.

283
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,645
The show's off.
I'm not doing the show anymore.

284
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:46,040
My artistic integrity was being
tampered with way too much.

285
00:12:46,075 --> 00:12:47,765
Rodney's organised one of those

286
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,880
farewell, walkout, guard of honour
sort of things, um...

287
00:12:50,915 --> 00:12:53,960
...which is compulsory
for all the drama kids to go to,

288
00:12:53,995 --> 00:12:56,360
so there should be
a fairly big turnout for that.

289
00:12:56,395 --> 00:12:59,165
Thank you. Thanks. 'Bye, everyone.

290
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,400
Who's creamed the car?
Has anyone creamed the car? No.

291
00:13:01,435 --> 00:13:03,405
See you, mate.
Yeah, see ya. Good.

292
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,840
But I've just...
I've reached the end of my tether.

293
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,477
I've come to the end.
And it feels right.

294
00:13:08,512 --> 00:13:11,079
Goodbye, Summer Heights High, forever.

295
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,965
Hi.
Oh, my God!

296
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,405
Oh, my God, you 're so hot!

297
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,765
Yeah, I'm, like,
a naughty AIDS nurse.

298
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,680
I thought you said
we all had to be African.

299
00:13:28,715 --> 00:13:30,560
Yeah, I didn't want
anyone else to copy.

300
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,320
Yeah, we just came
from the lockers, though,

301
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:34,765
and not everyone's got into it.

302
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,189
No. They still have to pay
the five bucks, though.

303
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,040
Jonah. Jonah should be
the only one at the computer, Leon.

304
00:13:42,075 --> 00:13:44,645
Miss!
Leon needs to finish his own story.

305
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,680
To be honest,
I'm a bit worried about Jonah.

306
00:13:46,715 --> 00:13:49,240
He seems, um... a little withdrawn

307
00:13:49,275 --> 00:13:50,805
and... and unhappy.

308
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,245
Doug's taking this
really hard line with him

309
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,480
and I'm just not quite sure
that it's the right approach.

310
00:13:56,515 --> 00:13:59,040
How are you going there, mister?
Alright, miss.

311
00:13:59,075 --> 00:14:01,045
He's losing confidence.

312
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,600
I just worry sometimes that we, as
a school, aren't doing him much good.

313
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:08,685
The last day of term
is Gumnut story day.

314
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,220
So I hope that everybody
sent their notes home.

315
00:14:11,255 --> 00:15:08,983
Why do we have to call it
Gumnut Cottage Story Day?

316
00:15:09,018 --> 00:16:06,712
That's... it means nothing.
It's an insult to me.

317
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,245
I forgot that you were
such a man now, Jonah.

318
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,480
Maybe you want to work on a new title,
something that's more manly.

319
00:14:20,515 --> 00:14:22,360
What about Gumnut Cottage
Wicked Day?

320
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,125
Yeah!
Yeah!

321
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,280
Guys, AIDS money. AIDS in Africa.
Did you guys bring your money?

322
00:14:27,315 --> 00:14:30,400
It doesn't matter if you didn't
wear casuals, you still pay.

323
00:14:30,435 --> 00:14:31,925
Thanks a lot.

324
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,880
Hello. How are you?
Hi. Good.

325
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,997
Have you got five bucks?
Yeah.

326
00:14:36,032 --> 00:14:38,080
Yep.
Oh, you came as a lesbian.

327
00:14:38,115 --> 00:14:39,685
That looks cool.
Thanks.

328
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,485
It kinda relates. Like, gay - AIDS.

329
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,080
It's just my casual stuff really.
Oh, cute!

330
00:14:45,115 --> 00:14:46,045
Hi, girls.

331
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,680
Mr Cameron, can I check
your heart rate?

332
00:14:47,715 --> 00:14:49,885
You all look great.
Only joking.

333
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,320
Appreciate what you 're doing, girls.
This is for a great cause.

334
00:14:52,355 --> 00:14:53,845
Thanks, Mr Cameron.

335
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,040
We are making so much money.
This is gonna pay for it easy.

336
00:14:57,075 --> 00:15:00,440
Remember that on story day
there's no school uniform,

337
00:15:00,475 --> 00:15:02,125
but I want you all to dress well.

338
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,560
I want you all
to look like gentlemen.

339
00:15:04,595 --> 00:15:06,125
OK, which means, Leon...

340
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,600
...which means collared shirts,
long pants.

341
00:15:09,635 --> 00:15:11,645
And I want your hair done.

342
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,925
Gumnut Cottage Story Day
happens once a year.

343
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,765
I don't even have a collared shirt.
Well, borrow one, Jonah.

344
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,405
The boys write and publish
their own stories during the term.

345
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,440
Some of their families have never
ever seen them or heard them read,

346
00:15:25,475 --> 00:15:29,000
and so suddenly there they are
reading their own stories

347
00:15:29,035 --> 00:15:30,445
in front of an audience.

348
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,040
I have to say
that I always end up in tears.

349
00:15:33,075 --> 00:15:36,165
Miss, how come
I can't use spellcheck?

350
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,480
'Cause if you use spellcheck
you 'll never learn how to spell.

351
00:15:39,515 --> 00:15:40,960
Don't read it, miss.
Uh, it's alright.

352
00:15:40,995 --> 00:15:42,405
Hands off the screen.

353
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,540
What the Year 7 s wrote
on Jonah's locker was horrible.

354
00:15:45,575 --> 00:15:48,207
It was really, really hurtful.
I really felt for him.

355
00:15:48,242 --> 00:15:50,840
It's really fantastic
that Jonah's not retaliating.

356
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,960
That's been really,
really good of him.

357
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,480
I think he's being very brave.

358
00:15:54,515 --> 00:15:56,320
Fuck off, miss.
I'm not.

359
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,085
Don't.

360
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,565
Sorry for saying "fuck off".

361
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,457
Just... finish up.
Go away, miss.

362
00:16:02,492 --> 00:16:05,315
Trust me for once.
I do, I do!

363
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,685
Hey, girl. Girls.

364
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,680
Girls, come over. It's me.

365
00:16:28,715 --> 00:16:30,125
It's Mr G.

366
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,718
I'm a teacher. Come over.

367
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,873
Is Mrs Cotton back yet?

368
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,645
Is everyone freaking out
that I'm not there?

369
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,840
Can you guys go back in and spread it
that I'm out the front?

370
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,434
Tell everyone. Thanks.

371
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,480
Um... Mr G, Miss Murray would like
to see you in her office.

372
00:16:50,515 --> 00:16:52,160
She told me to get you.
Miss Murray?

373
00:16:52,195 --> 00:16:53,605
How does she know I'm here?

374
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,040
She says she can see you
driving past from her office.

375
00:16:57,075 --> 00:16:58,485
Well, tell Miss Murray

376
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,160
that if she wants to talk to me
she can come to me.

377
00:17:01,195 --> 00:17:02,593
Go and tell her that.

378
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,765
$10, thanks.

379
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,873
Hi. Do you have your $10? Thank you.
You 're supporting AIDS.

380
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,045
Everyone in position.

381
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,640
Oh, my God, everyone's there.
I'm so nervous.

382
00:17:15,675 --> 00:17:18,077
Are you guys ready?
Um, I'm gonna go last.

383
00:17:18,112 --> 00:17:20,480
Hi, everyone.
Welcome to Fashion Parade.

384
00:17:20,515 --> 00:17:22,320
No, you go last.

385
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,240
This is a Dolce & Gabbana dress
that I wore to my Year 9 formal.

386
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:41,798
As you can see, it still fits me.

387
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,720
This is an outfit
that I might wear on the weekend

388
00:17:50,755 --> 00:17:52,560
if I'm just going to the shops
for something.

389
00:17:52,595 --> 00:17:54,845
It's very casual yet very now.

390
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,960
And remember, guys, bigger donations
will be accepted.

391
00:17:57,995 --> 00:17:59,485
Do it for the Africans.

392
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,640
Right, you go...
first you go knuckle,

393
00:18:01,675 --> 00:18:03,925
doosh, doosh, doosh, doosh, doosh.

394
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,400
The whole point is
that if he doesn't breakdance

395
00:18:07,435 --> 00:18:08,885
we're gonna be named
as the shitholers.

396
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,125
And if he does breakdance
and get caught he's gonna get...

397
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,200
He's not gonna get caught, because
no teachers go behind the gym.

398
00:18:14,235 --> 00:18:16,960
We got a text message
from Keiran last period.

399
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,525
Sent it to Joseph's phone,

400
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,920
and he said he wants to
battle Jonah after school.

401
00:18:21,955 --> 00:18:23,845
He wants to have
a breakdancing challenge.

402
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,620
He's gonna go round school saying
I'm not a good enough breakdancer.

403
00:18:26,655 --> 00:18:29,360
But the whole school already knows
you 're not a good breakdancer.

404
00:18:29,395 --> 00:18:31,845
I have to fucking do it, bro.
Don't do it, man.

405
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,040
If he doesn't do it then they'll go,
"Oh, there's that shit crew.

406
00:18:35,075 --> 00:18:36,605
"There's Jonah and his shit crew.

407
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,480
"They didn't even wanna
battle Keiran."

408
00:18:38,515 --> 00:18:39,925
I'm supporting him, youse are not.

409
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,960
If he gets expelled,
what are you gonna do then?

410
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,965
What if Keiran
tips off the teachers?

411
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,205
He's probably setting you up
right now, man.

412
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,360
What do you want me to do, boys -
just ignore the shit?

413
00:18:51,395 --> 00:18:53,525
Don't do it.
I have to do it.

414
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,200
What the fuck do you know about it?

415
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:56,805
You know I'm a good breakdancer.

416
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,560
I could beat... I could
squash that little homo

417
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,005
with one little fucking move.

418
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,560
Everyone knows
you 're the best.

419
00:19:01,595 --> 00:19:03,005
Text him back, Joseph.

420
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,560
Say I'll meet him at
the back of the gym after school.

421
00:19:05,595 --> 00:19:07,960
Bro, this is fucked, man.
Do it.

422
00:19:07,995 --> 00:19:09,405
Do it.
Fucking do it.

423
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,192
You 're fucking yourself
up, though, man.

424
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,085
Greg.
Hello.

425
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,045
Hi there.
I've noticed you parked here.

426
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,320
I'm just wondering how you 're
getting on and so on.

427
00:19:18,355 --> 00:19:19,965
Good. Fine.

428
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,800
Just... just on my way to the shops.
Do you mind if I get in?

429
00:19:22,835 --> 00:19:24,245
Because...
Yeah, that's alright.

430
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,558
I'd actually like you
to reconsider your resignation.

431
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,320
Well, that's very interesting,
but that won't be happening.

432
00:19:33,355 --> 00:19:34,800
Well, look,
why don't we just pretend

433
00:19:34,835 --> 00:19:36,317
that all of this didn't happen?

434
00:19:36,352 --> 00:19:37,765
You can just step back into it.

435
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,485
I don't even need to
process your letter.

436
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,320
Well, that would be very convenient
for you, wouldn't it? No paperwork.

437
00:19:43,355 --> 00:19:45,397
Greg, what I'd like you to do
is to think it through.

438
00:19:45,432 --> 00:19:48,136
You 've rushed into this.
I've thought it through.

439
00:19:48,171 --> 00:19:50,805
I don't think you have.
I know exactly what I'm doing.

440
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,440
I've been disrespected and mistreated
and shoved around, and I'm...

441
00:19:55,475 --> 00:19:57,680
<i>... I've made up my mind,
I'm not coming back to teach.</i>

442
00:19:57,715 --> 00:19:59,125
So forget it.

443
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,480
Well, look, as you know, Meredith
started again from leave today...

444
00:20:03,515 --> 00:20:06,245
<i>... and she and I believe
that you need a better title.</i>

445
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,840
If you 're willing to come back,
I'd like to give you the title

446
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,840
of creative coordinator
of the drama department.

447
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,357
Don't patronise me, Margaret.

448
00:20:15,392 --> 00:20:17,840
That is a pathetic title.

449
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,400
Just get on with your life.
I'm getting on with mine.

450
00:20:24,435 --> 00:20:25,845
Getting on with your life?

451
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,520
Why have you spent all day driving
up and down outside the school?

452
00:20:28,555 --> 00:20:30,085
Because it's on my way to the shops.

453
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,351
I do have a life outside
Summer Heights High, believe it or not.

454
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,000
Alright, Greg, if that's your attitude,
I can't do any more,

455
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:39,480
but if you want to change your mind,
you know where I am.

456
00:20:39,515 --> 00:20:40,925
Fine.
OK.

457
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,005
Fine.
See you, then.

458
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,680
How are the kids getting on with
the... cancelling the production?

459
00:20:46,715 --> 00:20:49,357
Are they upset?
We haven't cancelled the production.

460
00:20:49,392 --> 00:20:51,965
It's going ahead.
Well, I told you to cancel it.

461
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,200
No, I'm sorry, we're not gonna waste
a great production like that.

462
00:20:55,235 --> 00:20:58,400
Meredith's going to direct it
and we're going to open next week.

463
00:20:58,435 --> 00:21:00,760
Over my friggin' dead body
is she going to direct it.

464
00:21:00,795 --> 00:21:02,325
That's my show.

465
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,965
If you dare put that production on

466
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,040
I will sue your arse
for copyright infringement.

467
00:21:07,075 --> 00:21:08,845
Greg, I'm sorry.
You can't put my show on.

468
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,880
There's nothing more I can do,
I'm sorry about that.

469
00:21:10,915 --> 00:21:12,605
Alright, well, I'm coming back, then.

470
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,920
I'm coming back to direct the show.
I'm not coming back to teach.

471
00:21:15,955 --> 00:21:18,720
But tell Meredith to get
her grubby hands off my cast.

472
00:21:18,755 --> 00:21:20,165
And I'm moving back into the office.

473
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,400
I need the gym for the next five days
and I'll see you on opening night.

474
00:21:23,435 --> 00:21:24,880
Thank you.
OK. Alright.

475
00:21:24,915 --> 00:21:26,313
Thank you, Greg.

476
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,885
Sir, I said I'm sorry.

477
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,120
Ja'mie's in
a massive amount of trouble.

478
00:21:32,155 --> 00:21:34,445
Ashley actually told Mr Cameron

479
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,920
that we were using the AIDS money
to pay for the formal.

480
00:21:36,955 --> 00:21:39,445
And she's seriously getting busted.

481
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,805
It was Holly's idea.
You know where I stand.

482
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,880
It wasn't just me, the other girls
were just as much in it too.

483
00:21:44,915 --> 00:21:47,520
Ashley's just a little
goody-goody bitch for telling.

484
00:21:47,555 --> 00:21:49,285
What happened?

485
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,320
He's being a frig.
Well, what did he say?

486
00:21:51,355 --> 00:21:53,285
He's seriously mad.
Tell us what he said.

487
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,720
We have to give all the money
back to an AIDS charity.

488
00:21:55,755 --> 00:21:57,285
No way.
Are you serious?

489
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,440
Yeah, and he said he's punishing me
by cancelling the formal.

490
00:22:00,475 --> 00:22:01,885
Oh, my God, that's fucked up.

491
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,600
Seriously, if I have to cancel
the formal, I'm going to kill myself.

492
00:22:05,635 --> 00:22:07,437
He does not realise
how much work we've done.

493
00:22:07,472 --> 00:22:09,240
And he's gonna tell
the Department of Education

494
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:11,080
and I might have to
go back to Hillford.

495
00:22:11,115 --> 00:22:13,565
Seriously.
He is not gonna beat us.

496
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,600
We'll sort something out.
Seriously, what are we gonna do?

497
00:22:15,635 --> 00:22:17,357
Right, everybody reading on
to chapter two

498
00:22:17,392 --> 00:22:19,080
if you 've finished chapter one already.

499
00:22:19,115 --> 00:22:20,513
Can you please put your hand down?

500
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,280
Whoever that was, turn it off now
or it belongs to me.

501
00:22:27,315 --> 00:22:28,713
Do you understand?

502
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,220
It's from Keiran.
What does it say?

503
00:22:39,255 --> 00:22:41,560
It says, "Prepare to lose, fobs."

504
00:22:41,595 --> 00:22:43,965
Little fucking homo.

505
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,592
He's gonna fucking die after.

506
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,085
Fucker.

507
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,200
Jonah, do not tempt me!
I'm just sounding...

508
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:51,765
You are on thin ice as it is.

509
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,480
Now, do you want me to go
and speak to Mr Peterson

510
00:22:54,515 --> 00:22:56,045
about you misbehaving
in my class again?

511
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,880
I'm just trying to do the work, miss.
I couldn't sound out the word.

512
00:22:58,915 --> 00:23:02,040
I had to say it out loud.
No talking.

513
00:23:02,075 --> 00:23:03,685
Yes, miss.

514
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,045
Alright, everybody, now you 've got

515
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,885
another minute
to finish those questions.

516
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,245
I can't finish this in a minute.
We need more time.

517
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,637
Jonah, finish the questions
in silence like everybody else, OK?

518
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,525
Where do you wanna warm up?

519
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,405
We'll warm up
in the lockers.

520
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,760
Yeah, the teachers never
come into the lockers.

521
00:23:23,795 --> 00:23:26,517
Then we'll go
to the back of the gym.

522
00:23:26,552 --> 00:23:29,240
Jonah! Stop interrupting my class!

523
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:31,925
I have had enough of it!

524
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,518
What was the last thing I just said?!

525
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,792
What was the last thing
I just asked you to do, Jonah?

526
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,080
I don't know, miss.
I'm waiting. Don't know?

527
00:23:42,115 --> 00:23:44,285
I don't know, miss.

528
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,436
Well, how about an easier
question for you, Jonah?

529
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,320
What's the name of the book
we've been reading all term?

530
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,873
How about I give you a clue, Jonah?
It starts with the letter 'T '.

531
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,160
How about you just give me
any 'T ' word, Jonah?

532
00:24:04,195 --> 00:24:06,200
Any word that starts
with the letter 'T '.

533
00:24:06,235 --> 00:24:08,031
How about you do that?

534
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,440
Do you know what the letter 'T '
looks like, Jonah?

535
00:24:12,475 --> 00:24:14,257
Don't fuck with me, miss.
You 'll regret it.

536
00:24:14,292 --> 00:24:16,186
I'll regret it, will I?
Well, do you know what?

537
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,080
I've had just about enough
of you in my class.

538
00:24:18,115 --> 00:24:20,217
Now, get up out of your seat
and get out!

539
00:24:20,252 --> 00:24:22,285
Go to the principal's office!
No, miss!

540
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,800
Just pick your books up
and get out of my class!

541
00:24:25,835 --> 00:24:29,245
Just get out of my class!
Go now, Jonah!

542
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,397
I don't want to see you
back in here now. Just go!

543
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,060
So Mum's offered to pay
for the DJ and the venue.

544
00:24:41,095 --> 00:24:44,280
And you can give
all the AIDS money to a charity.

545
00:24:44,315 --> 00:24:46,365
And it's worked out really well

546
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,040
and you don't have to tell
the Department of Education.

547
00:24:49,075 --> 00:24:50,605
Well, thank you for coming in,
Mrs King.

548
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,560
You 're very welcome, Mr Cameron.
It's a very generous offer.

549
00:24:54,595 --> 00:24:58,480
But I'm afraid we can't sort of
deal with this issue like that.

550
00:24:58,515 --> 00:25:01,725
You must understand
that Jamie's very enthusiastic.

551
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,360
She is a very enthusiastic girl,
but this is a serious situation

552
00:25:06,395 --> 00:25:08,565
and we need to find a way
to deal with it.

553
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:13,245
So, um... Mum and I want to know
if you 'll accept a cheque

554
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,080
to keep quiet about this and not tell
the Department of Education.

555
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:18,245
No, Jamie.
We're really rich.

556
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,720
So just name your price
and we'll sort you out.

557
00:25:20,755 --> 00:25:22,285
Please, Mrs King, put it away.

558
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,400
To be honest, I don't want to tell
the Department of Education,

559
00:25:25,435 --> 00:25:29,017
so I have spoken
to the principal about this

560
00:25:29,052 --> 00:25:32,565
and we have agreed
to keep it under wraps.

561
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,160
If we can find a charity that
we could put the money towards...

562
00:25:36,195 --> 00:25:38,600
<i>Mmm, that's a good idea.
... then that would be good.</i>

563
00:25:38,635 --> 00:25:41,685
Now, to the matter of the formal.
Yep.

564
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,285
I've got an idea
that I'm going to put to you.

565
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,645
We can have the staffroom,
OK, as the formal venue.

566
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,040
You can bring in your stereo
and some streamers and balloons,

567
00:25:53,075 --> 00:25:55,600
you can decorate it up
as much as you like.

568
00:25:55,635 --> 00:25:57,285
No. Sorry.

569
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,680
Sorry, I'm... we're not
having it in the staffroom, sir.

570
00:25:59,715 --> 00:26:01,525
It's not an option, Jamie.

571
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,485
Sir, I'm...
It's the Year 11 formal, OK?

572
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,040
It's meant to be the best night
of Year 11 s' lives.

573
00:26:07,075 --> 00:26:08,605
I'm not...

574
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,820
The theme of the formal's
Rich for a Day,

575
00:26:10,855 --> 00:26:13,000
it's not
Povo Public School Crap for a Day.

576
00:26:13,035 --> 00:26:14,885
I'm not having it in the staffroom.

577
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,840
Jamie, I'm not giving you
an option here.

578
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:20,125
Sir, seriously.

579
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,840
It's the staffroom or no formal.

580
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:24,796
Mum, no.

581
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,445
Here's our star.

582
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,680
In a matter of hours,
the arena will ignite.

583
00:26:33,715 --> 00:26:35,800
G to Rodney.
Visuals in 20 seconds.

584
00:26:35,835 --> 00:26:37,605
'Mr G The Musical'!

585
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,080
One teacher tried
to make a difference.

586
00:26:40,115 --> 00:26:41,960
Hey, kids, it's time for school!

587
00:26:41,995 --> 00:26:43,125
# Ecstasy... #

588
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,840
# Some kids
call me a slut... #

589
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:45,845
# E, e, e... #

590
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,445
# Wanna tell the children... #

591
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,360
I'm a dreamer and I always will be.

592
00:26:50,395 --> 00:26:52,240
Say goodbye. See you in 100 years.

593
00:26:52,275 --> 00:26:53,685
Don't bend the poster.

594
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,400
Threatening a teacher
is an extremely serious business.

595
00:26:56,435 --> 00:26:58,800
Look at Miss Murray
when she's talking to you.

596
00:26:58,835 --> 00:27:00,737
Did you get busted again?
No.

597
00:27:00,772 --> 00:27:02,586
"Teachers at this school are gay."

598
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,400
Fuck off!
You 're a good bloke, sir.

599
00:27:04,435 --> 00:27:05,365
Let's go, boys.

600
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,885
We're setting up
for tonight's formal.

601
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,845
Get off the chair.
We have got the staffroom.

602
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,380
Teachers, can you get out?
I'm pumped for the formal!

603
00:27:11,415 --> 00:27:13,880
Kaitlyn, I totally wore
that style, like, two years ago.

604
00:27:13,915 --> 00:27:16,057
Oh, my God. What am I gonna do?

605
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,165
Oh, my God.

606
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,680
There's so many
attention seekers here.

607
00:27:19,715 --> 00:27:21,125
Ja'mie.
Ja'mie King.

608
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,045
You 're so hot, Ja'mie.

609
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,120
It's my last day. When the bell goes
I'm just gonna lose it.

610
00:27:27,155 --> 00:27:28,965
My friend Brianna's here.

611
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,445
Get a sense of humour, car!

612
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,800
Public schools rock!
That's not a large brain.

613
00:27:32,835 --> 00:27:34,358
High five for the holidays.
