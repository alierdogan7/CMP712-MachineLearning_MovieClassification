00:11:20,193 --> 00:11:21,558
sIeeping Iike an angeI .

177
00:11:21,627 --> 00:11:22,855
That true, Mrs. Hart?

178
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:24,419
It's the God's honest truth .

179
00:11:24,497 --> 00:11:26,260
My wife had nothing
to do with it.

180
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:28,698
She wouIdn't hurt a worm ,
not even a worm .

181
00:11:28,768 --> 00:11:30,360
It wasn't tiII I fired
the first shot

182
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:32,301
she even opened her eyes.

183
00:11:32,372 --> 00:11:34,567
I aIways said she couId sIeep

184
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,904
through
the St. Paddy's Day Parade.

185
00:11:36,976 --> 00:11:38,500
When I think of
what wouId have happened

186
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:42,105
if I went out for a beer
instead of coming home.

187
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:44,877
It makes you sick
even thinking about it.

188
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:47,442
BANDLEADER: For her first
number, Miss Roxie Hart

189
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,546
wouId Iike to sing a song
of Iove and devotion

190
00:11:50,623 --> 00:11:54,252
dedicated
to her dear husband , Amos.

191
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:58,927
* Sometimes l'm right *

192
00:11:58,998 --> 00:12:01,432
* Sometimes l'm wrong *

193
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:04,561
* But he doesn't care *

194
00:12:04,637 --> 00:12:08,038
* He'll string along *

195
00:12:08,107 --> 00:12:10,940
* He loves me so *

196
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:16,642
* That funny honey of mine *

197
00:12:19,218 --> 00:12:21,618
* Sometimes l'm down *

198
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:24,281
* Sometimes l'm up *

199
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:26,552
* But he follows round *

200
00:12:26,626 --> 00:12:31,063
* Like some droopy-eyed pup *

201
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:34,258
* He loves me so *

202
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:37,325
* That funny honey of mine *

203
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:39,997
After I shot him ,
he kept coming at me,

204
00:12:40,073 --> 00:12:42,234
so I had to puII
the trigger again .

205
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:45,106
* He ain't no sheik *

206
00:12:45,178 --> 00:12:47,146
* That's no great physique *

207
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:51,946
* And Lord knows
he ain't got the smarts *

208
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:55,583
* But look at that soul *

209
00:12:55,655 --> 00:12:58,215
* l tell you, that whole *

210
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:05,561
* ls a whole lot greater
than the sum of his parts *

211
00:13:06,532 --> 00:13:12,437
* And if you knew him like me *

212
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:17,135
* l know you'd agree *

213
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:22,977
* What if the world
slandered my name? *

214
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:29,852
* Why, he'd be right there
taking the blame *

215
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:33,050
* He loves me so *

216
00:13:33,126 --> 00:13:39,725
* And it all suits me fine *

217
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:44,930
* That funny, sunny honey *

218
00:13:45,004 --> 00:13:47,871
* Hubby of mine *

219
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,070
Supposing , just supposing ,
he had vioIated her.

220
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:54,739
-You know what I mean?
-I know what you mean .

221
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:57,305
Think how terribIe
that wouId have been .

222
00:13:57,383 --> 00:13:58,873
It's a good thing I got home
from work on time.

223
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:01,784
* He loves me so *

224
00:14:01,854 --> 00:14:05,517
* That funny honey of mine *

225
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:07,525
Name of deceased ,
Fred CaseIy.

226
00:14:07,593 --> 00:14:09,959
Fred CaseIy?
How couId he be a burgIar?

227
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:13,521
My wife knows him .
He soId us our furniture.

228
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:15,794
He gave us 1 0% off.

229
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:19,565
* Lord knows
he ain't got the smarts *

230
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:20,901
You toId me he was a burgIar.

231
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:22,634
He was dead when you got home?

232
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,005
She had him covered in a sheet,

233
00:14:24,076 --> 00:14:27,011
and she's teIIing me
some cock-and-buII story

234
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:30,071
and how I ought to say I did it
'cause I was sure to get off.

235
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:32,583
''HeIp me, Amos,'' she says.
''It's my goddamn hour of need .''

236
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:35,052
* Now he shot off his trap *

237
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:38,648
* l can't stand that sap *

238
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:40,419
- * Look at him go *
-And I beIieved her.

239
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:42,757
- * Rattin' on me *
-That cheap IittIe tramp.

240
00:14:42,828 --> 00:14:44,693
She was two-timing me, huh?

241
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:46,493
I'm through protecting her now.

242
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:48,534
She can swing for aII I care.

243
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:51,764
I'm down at the garage
working 1 4 hours a day,

244
00:14:51,837 --> 00:14:54,067
and she's up here
munching on bonbons

245
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,870
and tramping around
Iike some goddamn fIoozy!

246
00:14:56,943 --> 00:14:58,501
Thought she couId puII
the wooI over my eyes.

247
00:14:58,578 --> 00:15:00,569
- * That scummy, crummy *
-WeII , I wasn't born yesterday.

248
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:02,841
- * Dummy *
-Some things a man can't take.

249
00:15:02,915 --> 00:15:04,507
- * Hubby of mine *
-She pushed me too far.

250
00:15:04,584 --> 00:15:06,575
That IittIe chiseIer.

251
00:15:06,652 --> 00:15:09,177
Boy, what a sap I was!

252
00:15:09,255 --> 00:15:12,520
You doubIe-crosser!
You big bIabbermouth !

253
00:15:12,592 --> 00:15:14,457
You promised you'd stick.

254
00:15:14,527 --> 00:15:16,427
You been stringin' me,
Roxanne!

255
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:17,894
You toId me he was a burgIar!

256
00:15:17,964 --> 00:15:19,989
The whoIe time,
you been up here jazzin' him .

257
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:23,467
You are a disIoyaI husband !

258
00:15:25,871 --> 00:15:28,169
Look, it's true.
I shot him .

259
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:31,108
But it was seIf-defense.
He was trying to burgIe me.

260
00:15:31,177 --> 00:15:32,872
From what I hear,
he's been burgIing you

261
00:15:32,945 --> 00:15:35,436
three times a week
for the Iast month .

262
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:37,709
So what do you say, Missus?

263
00:15:37,783 --> 00:15:38,943
That's him , aII right.

264
00:15:39,018 --> 00:15:40,383
Thank you .

265
00:15:40,453 --> 00:15:42,648
Your story doesn't wash ,
Mrs. Hart. . .

266
00:15:42,722 --> 00:15:44,121
so try this on for size.

267
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,124
Fred CaseIy was a good time
on the side

268
00:15:46,192 --> 00:15:47,853
with Goofy here
as a meaI ticket.

269
00:15:47,927 --> 00:15:50,623
MeaI ticket?
He couIdn't buy my Iiquor.

270
00:15:50,696 --> 00:15:51,822
Fred CaseIy couId?

271
00:15:51,897 --> 00:15:53,865
With a wife
and five IittIe CaseIys?

272
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:55,833
Or did he forget
to mention them?

273
00:15:57,236 --> 00:15:59,761
What?

274
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,101
AII his.

275
00:16:01,173 --> 00:16:04,267
Oh , that bastard .

276
00:16:04,343 --> 00:16:06,641
That bastard !

277
00:16:06,712 --> 00:16:09,078
Yeah , I kiIIed him .
I wouId kiII him again .

278
00:16:09,148 --> 00:16:10,376
Once was enough , dearie.

279
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:12,508
Take her downtown . Come on !

280
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,420
This is it. 264 1 /2 .

281
00:16:17,023 --> 00:16:18,684
Here they come.
This way, honey.

282
00:16:18,758 --> 00:16:21,352
It's a shame to hide
such a beautifuI face.

283
00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:22,325
Why'd you shoot him?

284
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:24,192
Give us a profiIe with a smiIe

285
00:16:24,263 --> 00:16:25,821

289
00:16:31,404 --> 00:16:32,962
I'm ready to go

290
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,131
What do you mean , hanging?

291
00:16:34,206 --> 00:16:35,400
Not so tough anymore, are you?

292
00:16:35,474 --> 00:16:36,941
Take her down
to the Cook County JaiI .

293
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:38,909
We need a headIine.
Why'd you shoot him?

294
00:16:38,978 --> 00:16:40,878
Was he crueI? Did he beat you?

295
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:44,677
Hey, what do you mean ,
hanging?

296
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:04,927
Morphine, opium , cocaine?

00:17:18,684 --> 00:17:20,652
Put out that cigarette!

301
00:17:24,156 --> 00:17:26,386
Ever had Morton before?

302
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:35,262
She's fine.
Long as you keep her happy.

303
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:37,360
[ DrumroII ]

304

00:17:46,178 --> 00:17:47,941
Matron Mama Morton !

00:18:25,251 --> 00:18:26,240
On your feet.

314
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:30,752
WeIcome, Iadies.

315

* Always sees me through *

* Mama's good to you *

319
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:44,001
You might think I'm here
to make your Iife a Iiving heII ,

320
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:45,502
but it's just not true.

321
00:18:46,071 --> 00:18:49,131
* There's a lot of favors *

322
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,870

00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:54,310

* She'll do one for you *

325

I'd Iike to be your friend ,
if you Iet me.

326
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:00,684
So if there's something
that upsets you

327
00:19:00,753 --> 00:19:03,017
or makes you unhappy
in any way. . .

328
00:19:03,088 --> 00:19:05,215
don't shoot your fat-ass mouth
off to me

329
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,849
'cause I don't give a shit.

330

* They say that life

Let's go.

339
00:19:37,656 --> 00:19:38,987
You must be Hart.

340
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:41,851
Ain't you the pretty one.

Murderess Row, we caII it.

00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:54,636

AwfuIIy dumb, reporters.
They'II write it up wrong .

689
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:35,092
You deny the whoIe thing Iater.
Thank you .

690
00:37:36,534 --> 00:37:38,195
* All he cares about is love *

691
00:37:38,269 --> 00:37:40,203
Mr. FIynn , I'm Roxie Hart.

692
00:37:40,271 --> 00:37:42,466
-Who?
-Mama taIked to you about me.

693
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,303
Oh , yeah , right.
The cute one.

694
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:46,900
I was hoping
that you might represent me.

695
00:37:46,978 --> 00:37:48,309
You got $5,000?

696
00:37:49,614 --> 00:37:51,206
Gee, that's a Iot of money.

697
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:55,247
Mama didn't say anything
about $5,000.

698
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,812
Lookit, Mr. FIynn ,
I'm not very good at this. . .

699
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:01,757
but maybe we couId

700
00:38:01,826 --> 00:38:04,920
make some sort of
arrangement between us?

701
00:38:04,996 --> 00:38:07,430
I can be an awfuIIy good sport.

702
00:38:07,498 --> 00:38:10,331
Good , you got that
out of your system .

703
00:38:10,401 --> 00:38:12,665
You mean just one thing to me.

704
00:38:12,737 --> 00:38:15,228
You caII me
when you got $5,000.

705
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,900
* All he cares about is love *

706
00:38:18,977 --> 00:38:22,310
* Show me long raven hair *

707
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,975
* Flowin' down about to there *

708
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:29,747
* When l see her runnin' free *

709
00:38:29,821 --> 00:38:33,689
* Keep your money,
that's enough for me *

710
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:40,128
* l don't care
for drivin' Packard cars *

711
00:38:40,198 --> 00:38:44,794
* Or smoking long buck cigars *

712
00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:46,496
* No, no, not me *

713
00:38:47,438 --> 00:38:50,737
* All l care about
is doin' the guy in *

714
00:38:50,808 --> 00:38:53,038
* Who's pickin' on you *

715
00:38:53,111 --> 00:38:58,549
* Twistin' the wrist
that's turnin' the screw *

716
00:38:59,784 --> 00:39:05,086
- * All he cares about *
- * All l care about *

717
00:39:05,156 --> 00:39:15,464
* ls love *

718
00:39:20,238 --> 00:39:23,002
Oh , he'II see you now.

719
00:39:26,744 --> 00:39:28,541
WeII , heIIo, Andy.

720
00:39:28,613 --> 00:39:30,513
My name is Amos.

721
00:39:30,581 --> 00:39:32,606
That's right.
Take a seat.

722
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:36,513
You're a remarkabIe man .

723
00:39:36,587 --> 00:39:38,646
Your wife two-times you . . .

724
00:39:38,723 --> 00:39:40,315
pIugs the guy,
then tries to pin it on you .

725
00:39:40,391 --> 00:39:41,983
Most men wouId Iet
a dame Iike that swing .

726
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,051
But, no, you're sticking by her.

727
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,755
Makes you a hero in my eyes.

728
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:48,560
That's right.
I'm a hero.

729
00:39:48,633 --> 00:39:50,601
Did you bring the money?

730
00:39:51,335 --> 00:39:53,064
I didn't do as weII as I hoped .

731
00:39:53,137 --> 00:39:56,538
But I wiII , Mr. FIynn .

732
00:39:58,409 --> 00:39:59,876
This is onIy a thousand .

733
00:39:59,944 --> 00:40:03,937
PIus there's $300 I borrowed
from the guys at the garage.

734
00:40:04,015 --> 00:40:08,008
There's $ 7 00 from
the buiIding-and-Ioan fund .

735
00:40:08,086 --> 00:40:09,417
$2 ,000.

736
00:40:09,487 --> 00:40:11,478
And that's aII I got so far.

737
00:40:11,556 --> 00:40:14,548
But I'II give you $20
off my saIary every week.

738
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:17,958
I'II give you notes with
interest. DoubIe. TripIe.

739
00:40:18,029 --> 00:40:19,758
When you came to me yesterday. . .

740
00:40:19,831 --> 00:40:21,890
I didn't ask if she was
guiIty or innocent.

741
00:40:21,966 --> 00:40:25,402
I didn't ask if she was
a drunk or a dope fiend . No.

742
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:28,598
I said , ''Do you have $5,000?''
You said yes.

743
00:40:28,673 --> 00:40:30,641
But you don't have $5,000.

744
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:32,369
I figure you're a dirty Iiar.

745
00:40:32,443 --> 00:40:35,105
I don't waste my time
with dirty Iiars.

746
00:40:39,717 --> 00:40:44,245
Look. I'm reaI sorry,
Mr. FIynn .

747
00:40:45,523 --> 00:40:46,922
On the other hand . . .

748
00:40:46,991 --> 00:40:50,620
your devotion to your wife
is reaIIy very, very touching .

749
00:40:50,695 --> 00:40:53,596
I took your wife's case,
and I'II keep it. . .

750
00:40:53,664 --> 00:40:55,154
because I pIay square.

751
00:40:57,201 --> 00:40:58,634
Now, Iook, Hart. . .

752
00:40:58,703 --> 00:41:00,898
I don't Iike to bIow
my own horn ,

753
00:41:00,972 --> 00:41:03,941
but if Jesus Christ
had Iived in Chicago today

754
00:41:04,008 --> 00:41:06,442
and if he had $5,000
and he'd come to me,

755
00:41:06,511 --> 00:41:09,173
things wouId have
turned out differentIy.

756
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:11,644
AII right, this is what
we're gonna do.

757
00:41:11,716 --> 00:41:13,513
By the end of the week,
I'm gonna have Roxie's name

758
00:41:13,584 --> 00:41:15,575
on the front page
of every newspaper in town .

759
00:41:15,653 --> 00:41:19,316
''Sweetest IittIe jazz kiIIer
ever to hit Chicago.''

760
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,290
That's the angIe I'm after.

761
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,884
You make an announcement
we're gonna have an auction .

762
00:41:23,961 --> 00:41:25,895
We got to raise money
for her defense.

763
00:41:25,963 --> 00:41:28,955
They'II buy everything
she's ever touched .

764
00:41:29,033 --> 00:41:31,729
Your shoes, your dresses,
your perfume, your underwear.

765
00:41:31,803 --> 00:41:33,202
RO XIE :
And VictroIa records.

766
00:41:33,271 --> 00:41:35,603
Like the one I was pIaying
when I shot the bastard .

767
00:41:35,673 --> 00:41:36,765
BILLY:
I didn't hear that.

768
00:41:36,841 --> 00:41:38,809
Not that I didn't have grounds.

769
00:41:38,876 --> 00:41:40,867
-Hey, what are they?
-That's for triaI .

770
00:41:40,945 --> 00:41:42,879
Nobody's gonna care a Iick

771
00:41:42,947 --> 00:41:45,142
what your defense is
unIess they care about you .

772
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:48,151
The first thing we do is work up
sympathy from the press.

773
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:50,050
They're not aII pushovers
Iike Mary Sunshine.

774
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:52,954
But there's one thing
that they can never resist. . .

775
00:41:53,024 --> 00:41:56,221
and that is a reformed sinner.

776
00:41:56,294 --> 00:41:59,229
So, what was your
favorite subject in schooI?

777
00:41:59,297 --> 00:42:01,663
Oh , I was a reaI dummy.

778
00:42:01,732 --> 00:42:03,495
There must have been something
you were reaIIy good at.

779
00:42:03,568 --> 00:42:05,661
I got high marks
on courtesy and hygiene.

780
00:42:05,736 --> 00:42:07,465
Perfect.
You wanted to be a nun .

781
00:42:07,538 --> 00:42:09,301
A nun?

782
00:42:09,373 --> 00:42:10,397
Where were you born?

783
00:42:10,474 --> 00:42:12,635
On a chicken farm
outside of Lubbock.

784
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:15,474
Southern home fiIIed with
every Iuxury and refinement.

785
00:42:15,546 --> 00:42:16,672
Where are your parents?

786
00:42:16,747 --> 00:42:19,238
ProbabIy on the front porch
in their rocking chairs.

787
00:42:19,317 --> 00:42:20,409
Parents dead .

788
00:42:20,484 --> 00:42:21,781
FamiIy fortune swept away.

789
00:42:21,853 --> 00:42:24,219
You were educated
at the Sacred Heart.

790
00:42:24,288 --> 00:42:26,415
Then you feII
into a runaway marriage.

791
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:28,583
Left you miserabIe,
aIone, unhappy.

792
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:31,628
You got aII swept up
in the mad whirI of the city.

793
00:42:31,696 --> 00:42:33,527
Jazz, cabarets, Iiquor.

794
00:42:33,598 --> 00:42:35,930
You were drawn
Iike a moth to the fIame.

795
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,968
Now the mad whirI has ceased .

796
00:42:38,035 --> 00:42:41,596
You are a butterfIy
crushed on the wheeI .

797
00:42:41,672 --> 00:42:44,334
Which is it? Is it the moth
or the butterfIy?

798
00:42:44,408 --> 00:42:46,501
You have sinned ,
and you are sorry.

799
00:42:46,577 --> 00:42:48,340
God , that's beautifuI .

800
00:42:49,347 --> 00:42:50,609
Cut out God .

801
00:42:50,681 --> 00:42:52,672
Stay where
you're better acquainted .

802
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:56,379
Kid , when I'm through with you ,
not onIy wiII you be acquitted ,

803
00:42:56,454 --> 00:42:57,819
every man on that jury

804
00:42:57,889 --> 00:43:00,153
wiII want to take you home
to meet his mother.

805
00:43:00,224 --> 00:43:03,159
[ Southern accent ] I was born
on a beautifuI Southern convent.

806
00:43:03,227 --> 00:43:04,216
What?

807
00:43:04,295 --> 00:43:06,024
[ NormaI voice ]
Oh , hoIy shit!

808
00:43:06,097 --> 00:43:07,962
I'm never gonna get
this straight.

809
00:43:08,032 --> 00:43:09,465
Pipe down on the swearing .

810
00:43:09,533 --> 00:43:12,559
From here on , you say nothing
rougher than ''Oh , dear.''

811
00:43:12,637 --> 00:43:13,399
Try again .

812
00:43:13,471 --> 00:43:15,530
I was born on a. . .

813
00:43:44,969 --> 00:43:47,529
VELMA: I came up with more to do
on the witness stand .

814
00:43:47,605 --> 00:43:49,539
I thought I'd get aII teary-eyed

815
00:43:49,607 --> 00:43:51,575
and ask to borrow
your handkerchief.

816
00:43:51,642 --> 00:43:54,577
Then I thought I'd take a peek
at the jury Iike this.

817
00:43:54,645 --> 00:43:57,773
FIash 'em a bit of thigh , huh?
What do you think?

818
00:43:57,848 --> 00:43:58,974
Sounds great.

819
00:44:04,755 --> 00:44:06,188
Don't you want
to hear the rest?

820
00:44:06,257 --> 00:44:09,021
Tomorrow, kiddo.
You're at the top of my Iist.

821
00:44:10,161 --> 00:44:11,924
WeII , weII , weII .

822
00:44:11,996 --> 00:44:15,227
Sorry to be Iate, Mr. FIynn .

823
00:44:15,299 --> 00:44:16,960
Hope you weren't too bored .

824
00:44:17,635 --> 00:44:18,795
I Iike it.

825
00:44:22,106 --> 00:44:23,937
I Iike it.

826
00:44:25,977 --> 00:44:28,309
Hey, PoIIyanna. . .

827
00:44:28,379 --> 00:44:30,677
I heard your press conference
is tomorrow.

828
00:44:30,748 --> 00:44:32,443
Yeah , what's it to you?

829
00:44:32,516 --> 00:44:34,450
WeII , you wanted
my advice, right?

830
00:44:34,518 --> 00:44:36,076
WeII , here it is.

831
00:44:36,153 --> 00:44:38,644
Don't forget
BiIIy FIynn's number-one cIient

832
00:44:38,723 --> 00:44:40,816
is BiIIy FIynn .

833
00:44:40,891 --> 00:44:42,620
Meaning what?

834
00:44:43,461 --> 00:44:47,557
Meaning don't Iet him
hog the spotIight.

835
00:44:47,631 --> 00:44:49,861
You're the one
they pay to see.

836
00:44:53,771 --> 00:44:55,966
We can onIy seII them
one idea at a time.

837
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,701
I can stiII see him coming at me

838
00:44:57,775 --> 00:44:59,208
with that awfuI Iook
in his eyes.

839
00:44:59,276 --> 00:45:00,208
And?

840
00:45:00,277 --> 00:45:01,938
And we both reached
for the gun .

841
00:45:02,013 --> 00:45:04,504
That's right.
You both reached for the gun .

842
00:45:05,016 --> 00:45:06,142
Ready?

843
00:45:06,217 --> 00:45:07,411
Yeah .

844
00:45:08,552 --> 00:45:09,985
-Miss Hart!
-Miss Hart!

845
00:45:16,994 --> 00:45:18,086
Good day, gentIemen .

846
00:45:18,162 --> 00:45:19,254
GentIemen , Miss Sunshine.

847
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:22,026
My cIient has just entered
a pIea of not guiIty.

848
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:24,499
We Iook forward to a triaI
at the earIiest possibIe date.

849
00:45:24,568 --> 00:45:26,468
Are there any questions?

850
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,572
Miss Sunshine.

851
00:45:30,641 --> 00:45:32,302
As you know, my paper is dry.

852
00:45:32,376 --> 00:45:34,105
Do you have any advice
for young girIs

853
00:45:34,178 --> 00:45:36,339
seeking to avoid
a Iife of jazz and drink?

854
00:45:36,414 --> 00:45:37,403
AbsoIuteIy, yes.

855
00:45:37,481 --> 00:45:39,881
Mrs. Hart feeIs that
it was the tragic combination

856
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:42,248
of Iiquor and jazz
which Ied to her downfaII .

857
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:43,411
Next question , pIease.

858
00:45:43,487 --> 00:45:44,886
Ladies and gentIemen . . .

859
00:45:44,955 --> 00:45:46,980
I wouId Iike to say
how fIattered I am

860
00:45:47,058 --> 00:45:48,218
that y'aII came to see me.

861
00:45:48,292 --> 00:45:49,554
Mrs. Hart is very pIeased --

862
00:45:49,627 --> 00:45:52,095
I was a moth
crushed on the wheeI .

863
00:45:52,163 --> 00:45:55,291
You know, a butterfIy
drawn to the. . .

864
00:45:57,468 --> 00:46:00,699
I bet you want to know
why I shot the bastard .

865
00:46:01,172 --> 00:46:02,537
Shut up, dummy.

866
00:46:04,241 --> 00:46:06,402
BANDLEADER: Mr. BiIIy FIynn
in ''The Press Conference Rag .''

867
00:46:07,111 --> 00:46:09,204
Notice how his mouth

868
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,611
AImost.

869
00:46:10,681 --> 00:46:12,649
Where'd you come from?

870
00:46:12,716 --> 00:46:14,445
* Mississippi *

871
00:46:14,518 --> 00:46:15,815
And your parents?

872
00:46:15,886 --> 00:46:17,877
* Very wealthy *

873
00:46:17,955 --> 00:46:19,217
Where are they now?

874
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:21,152
* Six feet under *

875
00:46:21,225 --> 00:46:23,159
* But she was granted
one more start *

876
00:46:23,227 --> 00:46:25,821
* The Convent
of the Sacred Heart *

877
00:46:32,169 --> 00:46:33,727
* When'd you get here? *

00:46:33,804 --> 00:46:35,499
* 1 920 *

879
00:46:35,573 --> 00:46:37,768
* How old were you? *

880
00:46:37,842 --> 00:46:39,002
* Don't remember *

881
00:46:39,076 --> 00:46:40,907
* Then what happened? *

882
00:46:40,978 --> 00:46:42,673
* l met Amos *

883
00:46:42,746 --> 00:46:44,145
* And he stole my heart away *

884
00:46:44,215 --> 00:46:46,274
* Convinced me
to elope one day *

885
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:49,217
Poor dear! I can't beIieve
what you've been through !

886
00:46:49,286 --> 00:46:51,584
A convent girI .
A runaway marriage.

887
00:46:51,655 --> 00:46:52,849
TeII us, Roxie. . .

888
00:46:52,923 --> 00:46:55,084
* Who's Fred Casely? *

889
00:46:55,159 --> 00:46:57,024
* My ex-boyfriend *

890
00:46:57,094 --> 00:46:58,652
* Why'd you shoot him? *

891
00:46:58,729 --> 00:47:00,492
* l was leavin' *

892
00:47:00,564 --> 00:47:02,122
* Was he angry? *

893
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:03,632
* Like a madman *

894
00:47:03,701 --> 00:47:05,134
* Still l said,
''Fred, move along'' *

895
00:47:05,202 --> 00:47:07,432
* She knew that
she was doing wrong *

896
00:47:07,505 --> 00:47:09,439
* Then describe it *

897
00:47:09,507 --> 00:47:10,872
* He came toward me *

898
00:47:10,941 --> 00:47:12,431
* With the pistol? *

899
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:14,478
* From my bureau *

900
00:47:14,545 --> 00:47:16,274
* Did you fight him? *

901
00:47:16,347 --> 00:47:17,871
* Like a tiger *

902
00:47:17,948 --> 00:47:19,540
* He had strength,
and she had none *

903
00:47:19,617 --> 00:47:21,676
* And yet we both
reached for the gun *

904
00:47:21,752 --> 00:47:23,276
* Oh, yes, oh, yes,
oh, yes, we both *

905
00:47:23,354 --> 00:47:25,379
* Oh, yes, we both, oh, yes,
we both reached for *

906
00:47:25,456 --> 00:47:26,946
* The gun, the gun,
the gun, the gun *

907
00:47:27,024 --> 00:47:29,219
* Oh, yes, we both reached
for the gun, for the gun *

908
00:47:29,293 --> 00:47:30,851
* Oh, yes, oh, yes,
oh, yes, they both *

909
00:47:30,928 --> 00:47:32,987
* Oh, yes, they both, oh, yes,
they both reached for *

910
00:47:33,063 --> 00:47:34,360
* The gun, the gun,
the gun, the gun *

911
00:47:34,431 --> 00:47:37,025
* Oh, yes, they both reached
for the gun, for the gun *

912
00:47:37,101 --> 00:47:39,535
* Understandable *

913
00:47:39,603 --> 00:47:41,366
* Understandable *

914
00:47:41,438 --> 00:47:45,898
* Yes, it's perfectly
understandable *

915
00:47:45,976 --> 00:47:48,069
* Comprehensible *

916
00:47:48,145 --> 00:47:50,170
* Comprehensible *

917
00:47:50,247 --> 00:47:53,546
* Not a bit reprehensible *

918
00:47:53,617 --> 00:47:59,954
* lt's so defensible *

919
00:48:00,624 --> 00:48:02,319
* How you feelin'? *

920
00:48:02,393 --> 00:48:04,190
* Very frightened *

921
00:48:04,261 --> 00:48:06,252
* Are you sorry? *

922
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:07,661
* Are you kidding? *

923
00:48:07,731 --> 00:48:09,494
* That's your statement? *

924
00:48:09,567 --> 00:48:11,034
* All l'd say is *

925
00:48:11,101 --> 00:48:12,591
* Though my choo-choo
jumped the track *

926
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:14,695
* l'd give my life
to bring him back *

927
00:48:14,772 --> 00:48:16,467
- * And? *
- * Stay away from *

928
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,167
- * What? *
- * Jazz and liquor *

929
00:48:18,242 --> 00:48:19,937
- * And? *
- * And the men who *

930
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:21,272
- * What? *
- * Play for fun *

931
00:48:21,345 --> 00:48:23,438
- * And what? *
- * That's the thought that *

932
00:48:23,514 --> 00:48:25,209
- * Yeah? *
- * Came upon me *

933
00:48:25,282 --> 00:48:25,873
* When? *

934
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:28,418
* When we both
reached for the gun *

935
00:48:29,086 --> 00:48:31,111
* Understandable *

936
00:48:31,188 --> 00:48:33,179
* Understandable *

937
00:48:33,257 --> 00:48:37,455
* Yes, it's perfectly
understandable *

938
00:48:37,528 --> 00:48:39,860
* Comprehensible *

939
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:41,989
* Comprehensible *

940
00:48:42,066 --> 00:48:45,661
* Not a bit reprehensible *

941
00:48:45,736 --> 00:48:52,938
* lt's so defensible *

942
00:48:55,179 --> 00:48:59,639
* Oh, yes, oh, yes,
oh, yes, they both *

943
00:48:59,717 --> 00:49:04,211
* Oh, yes, they both, oh, yes,
they both reached for *

944
00:49:04,288 --> 00:49:05,312
Let me hear it.

945
00:49:05,389 --> 00:49:06,583
* The gun, the gun *

946
00:49:06,657 --> 00:49:09,888
* Oh, yes, they both reached
for the gun, for the gun *

947
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,257
* A little louder *

948
00:49:11,328 --> 00:49:13,387
* Oh, yes, oh, yes,
oh, yes, they both *

949
00:49:13,464 --> 00:49:15,830
* Oh, yes, they both, oh, yes,
they both reached for *

950
00:49:15,899 --> 00:49:17,196
* The gun, the gun,
the gun, the gun *

951
00:49:17,268 --> 00:49:19,327
* Oh, yes, they both reached
for the gun, for the gun *

952
00:49:19,403 --> 00:49:20,836
* Now you got it *

953
00:49:20,904 --> 00:49:22,735
* Oh, yes, oh, yes,
oh, yes, they both *

954
00:49:22,806 --> 00:49:24,831
* Oh, yes, they both, oh, yes,
they both reached for *

955
00:49:24,908 --> 00:49:26,603
* The gun, the gun,
the gun, the gun *

956
00:49:26,677 --> 00:49:29,908
* Oh, yes, they both reached
for the gun, for the gun *

957
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:31,811
* Oh, yes, oh, yes,
oh, yes, they both *

958
00:49:31,882 --> 00:49:33,941
* Oh, yes, they both, oh, yes,
they both reached for *

959
00:49:34,018 --> 00:49:35,576
* The gun, the gun,
the gun, the gun *

960
00:49:35,653 --> 00:49:37,086
* The gun, the gun,
the gun, the gun *

961
00:49:37,154 --> 00:49:38,678
* The gun, the gun,
the gun, the gun *

962
00:49:38,756 --> 00:49:40,815
* The gun, the gun,
the gun, the gun *

963
00:49:40,891 --> 00:49:48,195
* Both reached for the *

964
00:49:48,265 --> 00:49:56,229
* Gun *

965
00:49:56,307 --> 00:49:57,797
* Both reached for the gun *

966
00:50:02,946 --> 00:50:04,277
Move over, AI Capone.

967
00:50:04,348 --> 00:50:07,249
The Windy City has taken
a new criminaI to its heart.

968
00:50:07,318 --> 00:50:10,310
The name on everybody's Iips
is Roxie Hart.

969
00:50:10,387 --> 00:50:13,515
The sweetest IittIe Iady ever
accused of murder in Chicago.

970
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:16,855
Women want to Iook Iike her.
FeIIas want to go out with her.

971
00:50:16,927 --> 00:50:19,191
Some IittIe girIs
even want to take her home.

972
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,356
Don't get any ideas,
IittIe Iady.

973
00:50:21,432 --> 00:50:22,922
On the other side of town . . .

974
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,730
the assistant D.A. promises
the game IittIe sharpshooter

975
00:50:25,803 --> 00:50:28,169
wiII swing
before the year is up.

976
00:50:28,238 --> 00:50:29,170
Who knows?

977
00:50:29,239 --> 00:50:31,537
If he Iives up to his word ,
Assistant D.A. Harrison

978
00:50:31,608 --> 00:50:34,771
might become
Governor Harrison someday.

979
00:50:34,845 --> 00:50:36,745
Back at the scene
of the crime. . .

980
00:50:36,814 --> 00:50:40,477
everybody wants
a IittIe piece of Roxie Hart.

981
00:50:40,551 --> 00:50:44,214
This jar of coId cream
set her husband back $20.

982
00:50:44,288 --> 00:50:45,755
Maybe this pretty IittIe Iady

983
00:50:45,823 --> 00:50:48,656
wiII get some
of that famous Roxie styIe.

984
00:50:48,726 --> 00:50:53,823
It seems everybody these days
is rooting for Roxie Hart.

985
00:50:56,133 --> 00:50:58,226
Take those wiIting fIowers
to the orphanage

986
00:50:58,302 --> 00:51:00,361
and make sure they know
who sent them .

987
00:51:01,472 --> 00:51:04,908
So, kiddo, given any thought
to what you want to do

988
00:51:04,975 --> 00:51:06,374
after BiIIy gets you off?

989
00:51:06,443 --> 00:51:08,673
I think I'd Iike to go
on the stage.

990
00:51:08,746 --> 00:51:10,043
I figured as much .

991
00:51:10,114 --> 00:51:12,548
I aIready caIIed
the Morris office.

992
00:51:12,616 --> 00:51:13,776
ReaIIy?

993
00:51:13,851 --> 00:51:15,614
How much is that
gonna cost me?

994
00:51:15,686 --> 00:51:18,621
My standard deaI .
1 0% of aII your takings.

995
00:51:18,689 --> 00:51:20,714
Yeah , weII , we'II see, Mama.

996
00:51:20,791 --> 00:51:23,453
Besides, I don't even have
an act yet.

997
00:51:23,527 --> 00:51:25,552
KiIIing Fred CaseIy
was your act.

998
00:51:25,629 --> 00:51:26,857
Those stiffs in the audience

999
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:28,761
want to say they saw
somebody famous.

1000
00:51:28,832 --> 00:51:30,595
That's a freak act.

1001
00:51:30,667 --> 00:51:34,398
And besides,
I am better than that.

1002
00:51:34,471 --> 00:51:36,735
WeII , of course you are,
cupcake.

1003
00:51:36,807 --> 00:51:38,900
You can be as big as
Sophie Tucker.

1004
00:51:38,976 --> 00:51:40,443
You reaIIy think so?

1005
00:51:40,511 --> 00:51:42,138
Bigger than Cantor
and JoIson combined .

1006
00:51:42,212 --> 00:51:45,670
I aIways wanted to have my name
in aII the papers.

1007
00:51:45,749 --> 00:51:46,977
Before I met Amos. . .

1008
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:50,247
I used to date this
weII-to-do ugIy bootIegger.

1009
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:53,517
He used to Iike to take me out
and show me off.

1010
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:56,058
UgIy guys Iike to do that.

1011
00:51:58,395 --> 00:52:00,158
Once it said in the paper:

1012
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:03,097
''GangIand's AI CapeIIi
seen at Chez Vito

1013
00:52:03,167 --> 00:52:05,795
with cute bIond chorine.''

1014
00:52:05,869 --> 00:52:07,359
That was me.

1015
00:52:07,438 --> 00:52:09,838
I cIipped it, and I saved it.

1016
00:52:10,607 --> 00:52:15,135
You know, aII my Iife,
I wanted to have my own act.

1017
00:52:15,212 --> 00:52:17,646
But, no. No, no.

1018
00:52:17,714 --> 00:52:19,705
They aIways turned me down .

1019
00:52:19,783 --> 00:52:23,048
One big worId fuII of ''no.''

1020
00:52:25,322 --> 00:52:28,519
And then Amos came aIong .

1021
00:52:29,526 --> 00:52:32,689
Safe, sweet Amos. . .

1022
00:52:33,397 --> 00:52:35,763
. . .who never says no.

1023
00:52:40,137 --> 00:52:42,765
I've never done this before.

1024
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,502
But, you know,
it is such a speciaI night.

1025
00:52:45,576 --> 00:52:48,044
You are such a great audience!

1026

01:03:14,671 --> 01:03:17,105
You were in the paper
today, too. . .

1195
01:03:17,173 --> 01:03:20,108
in the back,
with the obituaries.

1196
01:03:20,176 --> 01:03:25,239
''VeIma KeIIy's triaI has been
postponed indefiniteIy.''

1197
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:29,917
Seven words. Wow.

1198
01:03:32,055 --> 01:03:35,786
Oh . Here's a IittIe piece
of advice.

Direct from me to you .

1200
01:03:37,694 --> 01:03:40,094

BILLY: This aII took pIace

AII right. Yeah .
Thanks, Tom .

1208
01:04:19,802 --> 01:04:23,067
They just arrested this woman
for a tripIe homicide.

1209
01:04:23,139 --> 01:04:23,833
ReaIIy?

1210
01:04:23,907 --> 01:04:25,932
Get this.
She's an heiress.

1211
01:04:26,009 --> 01:04:26,941
What?

1212
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:28,773
AII the famiIy's in . . .

1213
01:04:28,845 --> 01:04:31,439
pineappIes, grapefruits,
some kind of fruit.

1214
01:04:31,514 --> 01:04:35,041
So anyhow, this dame,
Kitty what's-her-name. . .

1215
01:04:35,118 --> 01:04:38,451
she's pIaying house
on the North Side

1216
01:04:38,521 --> 01:04:40,512
in an apartment
with a guy named Harry.

1217
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:42,683
What Harry does for a Iiving ,
no one's quite sure,

1218
01:04:42,759 --> 01:04:45,023
but it doesn't matter
because she's footing the biIIs.

1219
01:04:45,094 --> 01:04:47,289
Anyhow,
Kitty comes home tonight.

1220
01:04:47,363 --> 01:04:49,797
Harry's in bed ,
which is par for the course.

1221
01:04:49,866 --> 01:04:51,299
She goes to change.

1222
01:04:51,367 --> 01:04:56,361
When she returns, she notices
something rather odd .

1223
01:04:57,874 --> 01:05:00,001
ExtremeIy odd .

1224
01:05:04,714 --> 01:05:08,115
Kitty disappears for a second .
CooI as a cucumber.

1225
01:05:08,184 --> 01:05:12,086
When she returns,
she gentIy wakes up Harry.

[ Laughter ]

1227
01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:16,122
Harry says, ''What? I'm aIone.''

1228
01:05:16,192 --> 01:05:17,591
She says, ''AIone?

1229
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:20,424
You got two other women
in bed with you .''

1230
01:05:20,496 --> 01:05:24,262
So, get this.
Harry says, ''Come on , doII .

1241
01:05:59,569 --> 01:06:01,594
It's not your money.
It's your mother's money.

Roxie, who's the father?

1299

That question
is compIeteIy out of Iine.

Oh , it was the kid's name
I was thinking about, yeah .

1342

Here's a copy
of Roxie's first statement

1353
01:11:57,326 --> 01:11:58,816
from the D.A.'s office.

1354
01:11:58,894 --> 01:12:00,418
It says she hadn't copuIated
with you

1355
01:12:00,496 --> 01:12:02,088
for four months
prior to the incident.

1356
01:12:02,164 --> 01:12:04,098
WeII , she wouId know.

1357
01:12:04,166 --> 01:12:07,499
Yeah , I guess we hadn't done
no copuIating since. . .

1358
01:12:10,006 --> 01:12:12,440
Wait a minute.
That don't figure out right.

1359
01:12:12,508 --> 01:12:14,976
I couIdn't be the father.

1360
01:12:15,044 --> 01:12:17,774
Forget about that now.
My cIient needs your support.

1361
01:12:17,847 --> 01:12:19,644
You mean she needs
a meaI ticket.

1362
01:12:19,715 --> 01:12:21,114

Amos, when did you fiIe suit
for divorce?

1508
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:22,442
A month ago.

1509
01:22:22,517 --> 01:22:24,781
Was there any reason
at this time?

1510
01:22:24,853 --> 01:22:25,785
I'II say.

1511
01:22:25,854 --> 01:22:29,221
The newspapers said Roxie
was expecting a IittIe stranger.

1512
01:22:29,291 --> 01:22:31,657
That's hardIy grounds
for divorce, is it?

1513
01:22:31,727 --> 01:22:34,025
A IittIe too much
of a stranger.

1514
01:22:34,529 --> 01:22:38,158
You mean you doubted
the paternity of the chiId .

1515
01:22:38,233 --> 01:22:39,165
WeII , sure.

1516
01:22:39,234 --> 01:22:41,566
TeII me, Amos.
You share a bed with your wife?

1517
01:22:41,637 --> 01:22:42,797
Yes, sir, every night.

1518
01:22:42,871 --> 01:22:44,304
And you expect
this jury to beIieve

1519
01:22:44,373 --> 01:22:47,831
that you sIept
next to this woman every night

1520
01:22:47,909 --> 01:22:49,638
without exercising your rights
as a husband?

1521
01:22:49,711 --> 01:22:51,338
WeII , I couId've
if I wanted to.

1522
01:22:51,413 --> 01:22:53,278
-Oh , but you didn't.
-No, I did .

1523
01:22:53,348 --> 01:22:54,610
-Did what?
-Want to.

1524
01:22:54,683 --> 01:22:56,173
-But you didn't.
-Didn't what?

1525
01:22:56,251 --> 01:22:58,913
-What you wanted .
-Wait. I'm getting confused .

1526
01:22:58,987 --> 01:23:03,083
Did you ever question
Roxie herseIf?

1527
01:23:03,158 --> 01:23:05,991
Did you ask her if you were
the father of her chiId?

1528
01:23:06,061 --> 01:23:07,221
No, sir.

1529
01:23:07,296 --> 01:23:09,662
But if you became convinced
that you were wrong . . .

1530
01:23:09,731 --> 01:23:11,961
