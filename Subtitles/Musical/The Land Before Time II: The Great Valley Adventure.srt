1
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,509
<i>Our vast universe is filled...</i>

2
00:01:03,577 --> 00:01:07,206
<i>with objects of incredible size...</i>

3
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,115
<i>objects separated by distances
too great to measure.</i>

4
00:01:16,923 --> 00:01:20,859
<i>But it's also made up
of many millions of particles...</i>

5
00:01:20,927 --> 00:01:23,691
<i>far too small to see.</i>

6
00:01:23,764 --> 00:01:29,725
<i>And these tiny things
arejust as important to life
as the large ones.</i>

7
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:39,478
<i>Many eons ago, dinosaurs ruled our planet.</i>

8
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:42,447
<i>Most of them were huge,</i>

9
00:01:42,516 --> 00:01:46,418
<i>but among these giants
lived tiny creatures...</i>

10
00:01:48,388 --> 00:01:52,051
<i>dinosaurs the size ofkittens.</i>

11
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,765
<i>In a world of such immense creatures,</i>

12
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:05,532
<i>something so small
could easily be overlooked.</i>

13
00:02:07,073 --> 00:02:11,271
<i>But small things can be very important.</i>

14
00:02:12,345 --> 00:02:15,746
<i>The dinosaurs of the Great Valley knew that...</i>

15
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:21,812
<i>especially when that small thing
was a tasty flower...</i>

16
00:02:21,888 --> 00:02:25,517
<i>which bloomed
only once in a great while.</i>

17
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,956
They look so pretty.

18
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,330
And they smell so good.

19
00:02:38,405 --> 00:02:41,670
But mostly, they taste so great.

20
00:02:41,741 --> 00:02:44,335
Mmm.

21
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:46,641
They look all ripe and ready to me.

22
00:02:46,713 --> 00:02:50,308
<i>
Mm-hmm.
- Yep, yep, yep.</i>

23
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:52,715
<i>Me think so too.</i>

24
00:02:52,786 --> 00:02:55,311
I say we eat one.

25
00:02:55,388 --> 00:02:58,323
- Ducky, no. Wait!
- Whoa!

26
00:03:00,594 --> 00:03:02,528
Why did you do that?

27
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:07,192
Come on. You know the rules.
Everybody has to wait until Nibbling Day.

28
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:11,897
<i>Then we all come here together and
we take turns, and we all get a tree sweet.
</i>

29
00:03:11,972 --> 00:03:13,872
That's the way we always do it.

30
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:18,707
It's the only fair way to make sure
everybody gets a... Spike, don't!

31
00:03:20,914 --> 00:03:22,905
You've gotta wait too.

32
00:03:22,983 --> 00:03:25,975
Me get what you say
'bout bein' fair and all,

33
00:03:26,052 --> 00:03:30,455
but me thinkin' all the time...
all the time thinkin'...
and me think this:

34
00:03:30,524 --> 00:03:35,985
If me fly up to tippy-tippy-top
of tree-sweet tree and take tree sweets
from tree for me and you three...

35
00:03:36,062 --> 00:03:37,996
then we okay, see?

36
00:03:38,064 --> 00:03:40,225
Say that again?

37
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,031
Uh, no. Me just get 'em.

38
00:03:48,275 --> 00:03:51,472
Ooh. Lots of good ones up top.

39
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,004
Okeydokey, here me go!

40
00:04:05,992 --> 00:04:10,793
<i>
I asked you a question,young one.
What were you up to?</i>

41
00:04:11,865 --> 00:04:14,026
M-Me?
Oh. Oh, me.

42
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,799
Um, me think me see
flying pointy-bottomed stinger
up on tree sweets,

43
00:04:18,872 --> 00:04:21,033
so me tryin' to chase 'em off?

44
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:25,373
Well, all right then.

45
00:04:26,446 --> 00:04:30,610
<i>Everyone in the valley is waiting
for a taste of those tree sweets.</i>

46
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:32,618
They've been waiting a long time,

47
00:04:32,686 --> 00:04:35,883
and I don't want any of them
to be disappointed.

48
00:04:35,956 --> 00:04:41,724
That's why I've made it my job to pay attention
to every single little morsel on that tree.

49
00:04:41,795 --> 00:04:46,562
<i>And if even one of them disappears,
I'll know it.</i>

50
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:48,965
Understand?

51
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:54,029
Humph.

52
00:04:58,578 --> 00:05:01,308
<i>
He caught you so bad.</i>

53
00:05:01,381 --> 00:05:04,009
Looks like you'll have to wait
until Nibbling Day after all.

54
00:05:04,084 --> 00:05:08,783
And we all know who gets
the first tree sweet on Nibbling Day.

55
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:11,824
Yeah. Why is that anyway?

56
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:16,351
'Cause I was the first one to find
the tree-sweet tree. Everyone knows that.

57
00:05:16,429 --> 00:05:21,162
That is not how I remember it.
Nope, nope, nope.

58
00:05:21,234 --> 00:05:23,168
<i>Me 'member too.</i>

59
00:05:23,236 --> 00:05:26,433
<i>It was the first time us ever saw
the tree-sweet tree.!</i>

60
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:34,011
Hey, guys.
Come look what I found!

61
00:05:36,683 --> 00:05:39,948
- Hey, what's this?

62
00:05:45,058 --> 00:05:46,992
Oh, that is good one.

63
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,791
<i>
That's right.
That's exactly how it happened.</i>

64
00:05:55,402 --> 00:05:57,563
Heh. Yeah, I guess you're right.

65
00:05:57,637 --> 00:06:01,835
Littlefoot should have had
the first tree sweet.
He was just too... little.

66
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:04,240
Huh? What?

67
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,574
Oh, I don't mean " little" exactly.

68
00:06:06,646 --> 00:06:09,843
You know... short, small. Whatever.

69
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:13,408
You... You think I'm small?

70
00:06:13,486 --> 00:06:16,512
Come on.
Don't take it so personally.

71
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:21,424
I'm just saying you're not exactly
normal-sized for a longneck, are you?

72
00:06:21,494 --> 00:06:24,930
I'm... I-I'm still growing.

73
00:06:24,998 --> 00:06:29,765
Oh, is that what's happening?
Huh. It's taking a while, isn't it?

74
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:36,231
So long, " little foot. "

75
00:06:39,312 --> 00:06:41,507
Do not worry, Little...

76
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:47,180
U-Um, you will grow... someday.

77
00:06:47,253 --> 00:06:50,188
Me think so too... probably.

78
00:06:50,256 --> 00:06:54,090
Yeah. Thanks.
See ya later.

79
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,096
<i>
Way to go, Ducky.
I-I didn't mean to...</i>

80
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,433
<i>
Topsy? Is that really you?
Huh?</i>

81
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,637
Topsy! It is you.

82
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:15,875
- Tria?
- Mm-hmm.

83
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:20,409
W-When did you...
I-I mean... I-I mean, how-how did...

84
00:07:20,487 --> 00:07:24,184
I mean... Whoa-ho-ho.

85
00:07:24,257 --> 00:07:27,283
Why, Topsy,
you haven't changed a bit...

86
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,818
still the handsomest thing
with three horns.

87
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:37,761
Oh!

88
00:07:37,837 --> 00:07:40,067
Oh, I-I'm hooked.

89
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,839
Yep, the same old Topsy.

90
00:07:46,913 --> 00:07:48,972
That Littlefoot.

91
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:55,010
Imagine, telling me
I don't get the first tree sweet.

92
00:07:55,088 --> 00:07:58,649
<i>Of course you get the first tree sweet.</i>

93
00:07:58,725 --> 00:08:01,956
<i>Daddy?</i>

94
00:08:02,028 --> 00:08:04,826
<i>You'd do that for little old me?</i>

95
00:08:04,898 --> 00:08:09,995
<i>
W-Why, sure I would. I'd...
- Dad, is that you?</i>

96
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:12,537
Yeah. Great. So, um...

97
00:08:12,605 --> 00:08:15,165
So why don't we get together later.

98
00:08:16,376 --> 00:08:19,971
Whatever you say, good-lookin'.

99
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:23,777
<i>
- Daddy?</i>

100
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:26,341
Cera, uh, what a surprise.

101
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:29,183
Who were you talking to just now?

102
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:34,488
Talking to?
Why, u-u-um, u-u-um, um...

103
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:37,530
Hey, you know what
we haven't done in a long time?

104
00:08:37,597 --> 00:08:42,933
Gone to the watering hole together, huh?
Huh? Uh, what do you say?

105
00:08:43,002 --> 00:08:45,527
Just you and me...
family time.

106
00:08:45,605 --> 00:08:49,200
Okay. Sure, I guess.

107
00:08:55,248 --> 00:08:58,809
"Too little. " " Small one. "

108
00:08:58,885 --> 00:09:02,514
For now, maybe.
But one of these days...

109
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:25,067
Here, Littlefoot.
Would you like a ride?

110
00:09:25,144 --> 00:09:28,875
What's the matter?
You think I'm too small or something?

111
00:09:28,948 --> 00:09:31,109
Can't make it on my own?

112
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:35,120
Why, no, Littlefoot.
That's not it at all.

113
00:09:35,188 --> 00:09:39,056
Well, you'd be right.
I am small.

114
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,958
Perhaps for now.
But you'll grow.

115
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:44,155
Of course you will, Littlefoot.

116
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:48,462
Just think how big your dad is.
And your grandfather...

117
00:09:48,534 --> 00:09:52,732
<i>why, he was once your size,
and look at him now.</i>

118
00:09:53,806 --> 00:09:56,206
He was?
You were?

119
00:09:56,276 --> 00:10:00,406
Yes. Yes, Littlefoot, I was.
Just your very size.

120
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,971
Not by your age,
of course.

121
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:05,609
Uh, well, no.

122
00:10:05,685 --> 00:10:08,153
Uh, by your age, I had grown.

123
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:10,712
Thanks.

124
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:18,929
And so will you.
You'll grow. I promise.

125
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:25,103
Maybe they're right.

126
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:29,574
<i>Ah, maybe they're all right.
Maybe I am small.</i>

127
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:34,145
But I'm big enough
to get the first tree sweet.

128
00:10:39,752 --> 00:10:43,188
Come on.
You can do it.

129
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:49,157
Oh, yeah. I got you now.

130
00:10:49,228 --> 00:10:51,992
Almost there.

131
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,071
<i>Oh, no.</i>

132
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,899
Huh?

133
00:11:43,116 --> 00:11:45,516
Uh?

134
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:58,697
- Uh?
Did you hear something?

135
00:11:58,765 --> 00:12:01,996
Just a flier.
If you say so, big fella.

136
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:05,196
But it sure sounded to me
like somebody screamed.

137
00:12:05,271 --> 00:12:08,331
Nah. What would anybody have
to scream about...

138
00:12:08,408 --> 00:12:11,844
on a beautiful day like today?

139
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:23,555
What was that?

140
00:12:23,623 --> 00:12:27,150
Ah, Mr. Threehorn again.

141
00:12:27,226 --> 00:12:29,217
But what's wrong?

142
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:32,492
I don't know,
but I'm sure he'll tell us.

143
00:12:39,272 --> 00:12:43,641
So, Cera, you mad you not gonna get
first bite of tree sweets?

144
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:45,643
<i>What do you think?
</i>

145
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:50,045
Uh, yes?

146
00:12:52,518 --> 00:12:56,921
<i>
Have you ever seen such a sad sight?</i>

147
00:12:56,989 --> 00:12:59,150
All those tree sweets...

148
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:04,060
near the peak of their
flavor perfection... gone!

149
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:13,634
But that's not the saddest part.
The worst of it is that
someone here took them.

150
00:13:13,706 --> 00:13:18,803
<i>
- That's right.
Someone here stole from you.</i>

151
00:13:18,878 --> 00:13:23,178
Because of them,
you won't get a tree sweet.

152
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:27,583
<i>
Well, I was sure looking forward to eating
one of those tree sweets, because...</i>

153
00:13:27,653 --> 00:13:32,590
Well, because Topsy here
promised me the very first one.

154
00:13:32,658 --> 00:13:36,424
Didn't you, handsome?

155
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:42,629
Did her say " Topsy"? Ew.
D'oh!

156
00:13:42,702 --> 00:13:45,227
D'oh!

157
00:13:45,304 --> 00:13:51,265
What's the matter with...
I didn't do it! You hear me?
I didn't do it!

158
00:13:54,347 --> 00:13:55,974
Uh...

159
00:13:58,518 --> 00:14:01,385
Hey, I know you.

160
00:14:01,454 --> 00:14:06,949
I saw you running away
when Topsy and I
found the tree sweets gone.

161
00:14:09,362 --> 00:14:12,331
<i>
Well? What do you have to say
for yourself,huh?</i>

162
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:18,434
Okay, okay. I was here.

163
00:14:18,504 --> 00:14:22,736
But I didn't eat the tree sweets.
I didn't. I swear it.

164
00:14:22,808 --> 00:14:25,743
Oh, yeah?
Then who did?

165
00:14:28,714 --> 00:14:32,150
The little ones, that's who.

166
00:14:32,218 --> 00:14:35,779
Little longnecks...
I saw 'em with my own eyes.

167
00:14:35,855 --> 00:14:39,723
<i>- They were only about this tall.
What's he talking about?</i>

168
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:45,560
It's true.
And they ate all the tree sweets...
ate 'em right off the tree.

169
00:14:45,631 --> 00:14:50,227
I came walking along and saw 'em.
I was so surprised I screamed.

170
00:14:50,303 --> 00:14:54,865
- And then I ran away to, uh...
you know, to go find help.

171
00:14:54,941 --> 00:15:00,743
But I guess Mr. Threehorn came along
right then, and he saw for himself.
And then he screamed.

172
00:15:00,813 --> 00:15:03,441
Shouted, not screamed.

173
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,544
Okay. Yeah. Shouted.

174
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:13,252
So, wait. Y-You saying
the tree sweets all get et
by little-bitty longnecks...

175
00:15:13,326 --> 00:15:15,590
'bout this big?

176
00:15:15,661 --> 00:15:16,923
Yeah!

177
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:21,261
Yeah, right.

178
00:15:29,542 --> 00:15:32,978
Nice try.
You are in so much trouble.

179
00:15:36,215 --> 00:15:38,740
Oh!
He's telling the truth.

180
00:15:38,818 --> 00:15:43,778
<i>
Look, those bite marks were made
by something really small...</i>

181
00:15:43,856 --> 00:15:46,882
<i>even smaller than Littlefoot.</i>

182
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,725
- Topsy's right.

183
00:15:53,032 --> 00:15:55,592
Me sorry
me no believe you.

184
00:15:55,668 --> 00:15:58,296
<i>
But this is terrible news...</i>

185
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:02,432
our valley infested with tiny pests...

186
00:16:02,508 --> 00:16:07,571
who creep and crawl around
under our very snouts eating our food?

187
00:16:07,647 --> 00:16:09,581
Ugh, disgusting.

188
00:16:09,915 --> 00:16:11,974
Little things are awful.
I hate 'em!

189
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:14,542
Oh.

190
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:27,490
Creepy crawlies
Creepy crawlies

191
00:16:27,566 --> 00:16:31,798
Everybody hates those little
creepy crawlies

192
00:16:31,871 --> 00:16:34,339
-  They tickle and they bite
- Ooh!

193
00:16:34,407 --> 00:16:36,671
-  They sneak around at night
- Ooh!

194
00:16:36,742 --> 00:16:40,473
Everything about them
is just not right

195
00:16:40,546 --> 00:16:45,677
Those little creepy crawlies
Creepy crawlies

196
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:47,946
Icky, sticky
Tiny, spiny

197
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,954
Creepy crawlies

198
00:16:50,022 --> 00:16:52,547
-  They nibble on your ears
- Ouch!

199
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,525
And in-between your toes
No!

200
00:16:54,593 --> 00:16:58,290
They eat all your food
out from under your nose

201
00:16:58,364 --> 00:17:02,266
Those awful creepy crawlies

202
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,205
They might be smart
They might be dumb

203
00:17:08,274 --> 00:17:12,370
-  We don't know what they look like
-  Or where they're from

204
00:17:12,445 --> 00:17:17,246
The only thing we know is
they're different from us

205
00:17:17,316 --> 00:17:20,877
And anything that's different
is dangerous

206
00:17:20,953 --> 00:17:24,411
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

207
00:17:26,592 --> 00:17:30,653
Creepy crawlies
Creepy crawlies

208
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,224
The world's a better place
without those creepy crawlies

209
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:40,000
But every living thing
has a role to play

210
00:17:40,072 --> 00:17:42,734
-  They might be nice
- No, sir!

211
00:17:42,808 --> 00:17:46,403
- No way!
-  Not icky, sticky

212
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:48,845
Tiny, spiny

213
00:17:48,914 --> 00:17:52,247
Nitsy, gnatsy
Smash 'em flatsy

214
00:17:52,318 --> 00:17:57,187
Creepy crawlies

215
00:17:57,256 --> 00:17:59,349
Eww!

216
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:04,953
Of course, you know
what we all have to do.

217
00:18:07,032 --> 00:18:10,559
We have to hunt them down
and exterminate them.

218
00:18:13,606 --> 00:18:15,938
<i>
Wait.! Wait, everyone, please.</i>

219
00:18:16,008 --> 00:18:19,000
Let's not get carried away.

220
00:18:19,078 --> 00:18:24,380
These little creatures, whoever they are,
have as much right to be here as we do.

221
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:28,147
And they have as much right
to eat the tree sweets.

222
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:38,957
Then it's settled.
We'll rid the valley of this threat.
Who wants to search where?

223
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:44,365
Spike and I will search together.

224
00:18:44,437 --> 00:18:47,497
Mm-hmm.
And we will find the little ones first.
Yep, yep, yep.

225
00:18:47,573 --> 00:18:51,634
Oh, yeah?
Well, me a flier, so me look from sky.

226
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,905
Me find 'em before you!

227
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:56,607
Come on, Spike. Let us hurry.

228
00:18:59,051 --> 00:19:02,179
<i>
Cera, what's wrong?</i>

229
00:19:02,254 --> 00:19:07,214
Why don't I go with you, Topsy?
Well, all right, but, uh,
we have to be careful.

230
00:19:08,294 --> 00:19:13,288
<i>
Oh, Cera. Oh, um,</i>

231
00:19:13,365 --> 00:19:16,027
would you like
to search with me?

232
00:19:18,103 --> 00:19:20,799
We, um...

233
00:19:20,873 --> 00:19:23,535
Hmm. We need to talk.

234
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:26,772
<i>
Topsy, come on.!</i>

235
00:19:26,846 --> 00:19:31,146
Go talk with her.
I'm hunting with Littlefoot.

236
00:19:31,217 --> 00:19:33,913
<i>
Cera. Cera.!</i>

237
00:19:33,986 --> 00:19:36,352
<i>
Littlefoot, let's go.</i>

238
00:19:50,202 --> 00:19:53,968
Creepy crawlies
Creepy crawlies

239
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:58,373
It is so much fun
to look for creepy crawlies

240
00:19:58,444 --> 00:20:00,378
Searching all around

241
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:02,380
Our noses to the ground

242
00:20:02,448 --> 00:20:07,715
Hoping that the little creatures
can be found, those little

243
00:20:07,786 --> 00:20:11,187
Creepy crawlies
Creepy crawlies

244
00:20:11,257 --> 00:20:15,193
Me will be the one
to find those creepy crawlies

245
00:20:15,261 --> 00:20:19,425
Me flying very high
with such a sharply eye

246
00:20:19,498 --> 00:20:23,434
<i>Nothing can escape
the looker in the sky</i>

247
00:20:23,502 --> 00:20:27,097
<i>Not even creepy crawlies</i>

248
00:20:28,607 --> 00:20:31,098
Creepy crawlies

249
00:20:32,678 --> 00:20:34,771
Creepy
Creepy

250
00:20:34,847 --> 00:20:36,940
-  Crawlies
-  Crawlies

251
00:20:37,016 --> 00:20:41,282
Creepy, crawly, creepy
Creepy crawlies

252
00:20:46,992 --> 00:20:50,792
Remember, these things
are small and fast.

253
00:20:50,863 --> 00:20:54,196
Keep your head to the ground
and your eyes open.

254
00:20:57,603 --> 00:20:59,628
Ow!
Ooh!

255
00:21:01,473 --> 00:21:04,203
Huh?

256
00:21:06,845 --> 00:21:12,044
Hey, you, come back here!
Hold it right there, buster.
You're in big trouble.

257
00:21:12,117 --> 00:21:14,108
Hey! I said stop!

258
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:39,443
No tiny longnecks there.
Nope, nope nope.

259
00:21:43,248 --> 00:21:45,546
Searching for the little ones
is kinda fun.

260
00:21:47,753 --> 00:21:49,687
Mm-hmm.

261
00:21:50,756 --> 00:21:54,749
- Hmm.

262
00:21:54,827 --> 00:21:57,796
<i>
I do not think grown-ups
are too good at it though.</i>

263
00:21:57,863 --> 00:21:59,797
Come back here!
Get over here!

264
00:22:02,434 --> 00:22:06,666
<i>
And I do not think Petrie will see anything
from up there either.</i>

265
00:22:06,739 --> 00:22:10,300
Nothing escape the looker in the sky.

266
00:22:10,376 --> 00:22:13,709
Me see everything.
Me know everything.

267
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:18,216
Hoo-hoo!
Me swoop down
on tree-sweet stealers and...

268
00:22:18,283 --> 00:22:23,186
Me see one...
teeny little longneck.

269
00:22:23,255 --> 00:22:26,782
Here come looker in the sky!

270
00:22:29,528 --> 00:22:32,463
<i>Hold it right there,
you tree-sweet stealer.!</i>

271
00:22:43,709 --> 00:22:46,303
Petrie, are you all right?

272
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:50,075
Me okay,

273
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:53,607
but you look way lot littler
from up there.

274
00:22:56,855 --> 00:23:00,382
And they swarmed all over the tree...

275
00:23:00,459 --> 00:23:04,828
just like a big bunch
of underground creepy crawlers,

276
00:23:06,765 --> 00:23:08,824
only a lot bigger, and...

277
00:23:08,901 --> 00:23:11,893
Okay, okay!
Nobody really cares.

278
00:23:17,376 --> 00:23:21,710
Hey, who was that
with your dad anyway?
They sure looked friendly.

279
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,841
- Hmm.
- Have you known her long?

280
00:23:28,987 --> 00:23:31,353
Hey, you think maybe he likes her?

281
00:23:31,423 --> 00:23:35,416
- She gonna be your new mom?

282
00:23:35,494 --> 00:23:39,225
No! Are you crazy?

283
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:42,290
No, no, no!

284
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:55,312
Sorry.
I was only asking.

285
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,144
Well, don't ever ask again.

286
00:23:59,284 --> 00:24:01,218
Humph!

287
00:24:01,286 --> 00:24:05,120
Yeah. Okay. Sure.

288
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,920
Um, you wanna look
for tiny longnecks now?

289
00:24:07,993 --> 00:24:11,952
No!

290
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:14,225
Sort of a waste of time anyway.

291
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,263
How do you find something that little
in a valley this big?

292
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:24,632
Huh...

293
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,871
Oh, great.

294
00:24:26,945 --> 00:24:32,076
Help! Cera!

295
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,547
Would you get up, please?

296
00:24:36,622 --> 00:24:41,525
Huh? H-H-Huh?
Do you mind? I can't breathe.

297
00:24:45,264 --> 00:24:48,665
Ah. That's better.

298
00:24:54,306 --> 00:24:58,037
Hmm, was it
something I said?

299
00:25:08,554 --> 00:25:11,580
<i>
Whoa-ho-ho.</i>

300
00:25:13,292 --> 00:25:16,955
<i>Oh, Topsy,
you say the silliest things.</i>

301
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,994
- Well?

302
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:27,630
Find any tiny longnecks
up there?

303
00:25:27,706 --> 00:25:32,006
Why, uh, Cera, how...
Who, uh...

304
00:25:32,077 --> 00:25:36,377
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

305
00:25:36,448 --> 00:25:40,384
Cera, here's somebody
I've been wanting you to meet.

306
00:25:40,452 --> 00:25:44,548
She just migrated here
after the cold time, and, uh...

307
00:25:44,623 --> 00:25:48,286
Huh, well, the funniest thing.

308
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,624
We know each other...

309
00:25:50,696 --> 00:25:53,722
oh, from a long time ago.

310
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:56,529
I was a wild young fella,

311
00:25:56,602 --> 00:25:59,366
and she was the cutest...
Cut it out.

312
00:26:02,307 --> 00:26:07,643
But, so, um, anyway,
her name's Tria.

313
00:26:08,981 --> 00:26:13,350
Hello, Cera.
Topsy's told me
so much about you.

314
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:17,752
Funny, he hasn't told me
anything about you.

315
00:26:23,195 --> 00:26:25,186
That went well.

316
00:26:40,646 --> 00:26:44,104
Uh? Huh? Uh?

317
00:26:48,553 --> 00:26:51,283
- Don't run away again.

318
00:26:51,356 --> 00:26:54,792
Uh, you're not gonna do anything to me.

319
00:26:57,429 --> 00:27:01,126
What could we do
to somebody as big as you?

320
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:03,599
<i>
Yeah. You're gigantic.</i>

321
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:09,198
Hey. That's right.
I am big, aren't I?

322
00:27:09,274 --> 00:27:11,504
Yeah! I'm big.

323
00:27:11,576 --> 00:27:14,739
I... am... big!

324
00:27:14,813 --> 00:27:19,079
Do you remember me?
Uh, should I?

325
00:27:19,151 --> 00:27:22,518
Sure. I ate a tree sweet off your nose.

326
00:27:22,587 --> 00:27:26,148
Sorta icky, but good.
I stood right on top of you.

327
00:27:28,126 --> 00:27:30,754
Sorry, not me.

328
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:34,094
You sure? 'Cause I could've sworn...

329
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:39,934
Nope. Different longneck.
We all kinda look alike,
so it's a natural mistake.

330
00:27:41,873 --> 00:27:46,105
Okay, if you say so.
Anyway, my name's Skitter.

331
00:27:46,178 --> 00:27:49,841
Nice to meet you.
They call me Littlefoot.

332
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:54,352
You've gotta be kidding.

333
00:27:59,624 --> 00:28:02,024
Hey, meet my friends.

334
00:28:02,094 --> 00:28:05,029
This is Rocky
and his twin sister, Dusty.

335
00:28:05,097 --> 00:28:07,861
No. I'm Rocky,
and she's...
Dusty.

336
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:10,959
Sorry. Anyway, this is Lizzie.

337
00:28:11,036 --> 00:28:14,836
- Hi.
- And over there's Chatter, and there's...

338
00:28:14,906 --> 00:28:18,842
<i>Skitter.! Lizzie.!</i>

339
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:22,903
- Better hide. That's Big Daddy!
-" Big Daddy"?

340
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:27,383
<i>- Do you kids hear me
when I'm talking to you?
</i>

341
00:28:30,022 --> 00:28:32,718
You kids might as well come out.

342
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:36,090
I'll find you sooner or later.

343
00:28:37,095 --> 00:28:39,996
<i>Uh,yes, sir. Yes, Daddy.
All right. Sorry.</i>

344
00:28:40,065 --> 00:28:43,398
- Yes, sir.

345
00:28:45,404 --> 00:28:47,395
You okay?

346
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:01,048
You!

347
00:29:03,155 --> 00:29:05,282
M-M-Me?

348
00:29:05,357 --> 00:29:07,621
You told them about us, didn't you?

349
00:29:07,692 --> 00:29:10,252
You told the big ones.

350
00:29:10,328 --> 00:29:14,458
No, Big Daddy.
It wasn't him.
I made the same mistake.

351
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:16,467
It was somebody who looks like him.

352
00:29:16,535 --> 00:29:18,935
Hey, maybe he's a...
Twin.

353
00:29:25,577 --> 00:29:29,741
Well, uh,
if you kids say so.

354
00:29:29,815 --> 00:29:33,717
But you know better
than to bring a big one here.

355
00:29:33,785 --> 00:29:38,415
Lizzie, I'm ashamed of you.
My own daughter...

356
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,924
<i>But, Daddy...
Sir, um,</i>

357
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,552
they didn't bring me here.

358
00:29:43,628 --> 00:29:45,994
I sorta fell in.

359
00:29:46,064 --> 00:29:50,125
Oh.

360
00:29:50,202 --> 00:29:54,229
Nobody's fault then.

361
00:29:54,306 --> 00:29:58,504
Well, I guess that's it.
We're moving!

362
00:30:02,581 --> 00:30:07,314
Kids, we've got to go.
They found us.

363
00:30:07,385 --> 00:30:09,683
They haven't found you.

364
00:30:09,754 --> 00:30:13,246
I'm the only one,
and I won't tell.

365
00:30:13,325 --> 00:30:16,260
It doesn't matter.
We have to go anyway.

366
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:21,493
Your folks are looking everywhere for us.
We can't even sneak out at night
to find food.

367
00:30:21,566 --> 00:30:24,160
It's true. We're awful hungry.

368
00:30:25,604 --> 00:30:29,404
Maybe I could help.

369
00:30:42,187 --> 00:30:44,178
I'll be back.

370
00:31:14,186 --> 00:31:16,120
Hmm.

371
00:31:34,272 --> 00:31:36,706
Huh?

372
00:31:36,775 --> 00:31:39,608
<i>Hey.! Littlefoot did it.!
I told you he would.</i>

373
00:31:44,316 --> 00:31:46,307
Oh!

374
00:31:49,988 --> 00:31:53,617
<i>
Night, guys.</i>

375
00:31:53,692 --> 00:31:55,922
<i>
Bye, Littlefoot. Thanks.!</i>

376
00:32:03,568 --> 00:32:06,230
Littlefoot, get up.

377
00:32:06,304 --> 00:32:08,898
Yeah.

378
00:32:15,914 --> 00:32:20,248
Get up. Get up. Get up.
The little longnecks
have striked again.

379
00:32:20,318 --> 00:32:22,309
What?

380
00:32:23,388 --> 00:32:25,652
Thieves in the night.
That's what they are.

381
00:32:25,724 --> 00:32:28,625
They don't eat only tree sweets
but tree stars as well.

382
00:32:28,693 --> 00:32:31,253
And they even strike
while we're asleep.

383
00:32:31,329 --> 00:32:34,423
We must find them.

384
00:32:34,499 --> 00:32:36,433
<i>Let's form some search teams.</i>

385
00:32:36,501 --> 00:32:38,833
<i>
He's really something, isn't he?
Huh?</i>

386
00:32:38,903 --> 00:32:42,236
<i>Strong and commanding...
and cute.</i>

387
00:32:42,307 --> 00:32:47,472
You don't know anything about him.
I used to...
back when we were younger.

388
00:32:47,545 --> 00:32:51,276
I'd like to get to know him again.
Like to get to know you too.

389
00:32:51,349 --> 00:32:54,147
Yeah?
Well, don't hold your breath.

390
00:33:09,668 --> 00:33:11,602
Cera, come hunt with us.

391
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:16,130
Your dad says whoever finds the little
longnecks first will get a special treat.
Uh-huh.

392
00:33:16,207 --> 00:33:19,176
Yeah? Like what?

393
00:33:19,244 --> 00:33:22,771
I do not know exactly,
but old Topsy says...

394
00:33:24,215 --> 00:33:29,016
Don't ever call my dad that again.
Got it?
Yep.

395
00:33:30,422 --> 00:33:33,482
So, she gonna go
with us or what?

396
00:33:57,682 --> 00:34:01,311
Hey, uh, what's that over there?

397
00:34:01,386 --> 00:34:03,320
I think I see something.

398
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:08,223
Come on! Follow me!

399
00:34:12,597 --> 00:34:14,531
<i>
Aw, it is not them.</i>

400
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:19,434
<i>
Ow.! Oh, whatever it is,
it bites.</i>

401
00:34:41,426 --> 00:34:43,451
<i>
Thank you.</i>

402
00:35:25,503 --> 00:35:28,233
Cera, are you awake?

403
00:35:29,307 --> 00:35:34,870
Look, I'm...
I-I-I-I don't... I, um...
It's just that...

404
00:35:34,946 --> 00:35:36,880
Oh.

405
00:35:36,948 --> 00:35:39,849
This is so much harder than yelling.

406
00:35:40,852 --> 00:35:46,313
Look. Tria's an old friend,
and she doesn't have anyone.

407
00:35:46,391 --> 00:35:52,330
She needs protection,
and she's really nice.

408
00:35:52,397 --> 00:35:54,592
She...

409
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:59,330
Well, she likes me, and I like her.

410
00:36:00,905 --> 00:36:06,605
But I want things back the way
they were before, when you didn't
like anybody and nobody liked you.

411
00:36:08,446 --> 00:36:13,281
I don't think things are ever
going to be that way again.

412
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:15,285
Humph.

413
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:40,542
Humph. " Tria. " Tri-a.

414
00:36:40,612 --> 00:36:42,671
Humph.

415
00:36:42,747 --> 00:36:46,046
What kind of dopey name
is that anyway?
Huh?

416
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:57,292
Hmm.
He's up to something.

417
00:36:57,362 --> 00:36:59,557
And I'm gonna find out what.

418
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,573
I did not call your dad " Topsy. "
I promise.

419
00:37:12,644 --> 00:37:17,343
Shh. Come on. And bring Spike.

420
00:37:30,862 --> 00:37:33,057
Petrie, wake up!

421
00:37:42,941 --> 00:37:45,535
What... is... matter with you?

422
00:37:46,611 --> 00:37:49,273
Cera was wondering
if you could come down.

423
00:37:49,347 --> 00:37:52,783
Well, me think...
me have no... choice!

424
00:38:03,194 --> 00:38:06,755
What do you think he's doing?
Taking a snack to Grandpa and Grandma?

425
00:38:10,468 --> 00:38:13,232
Maybe he gather tree stars in his sleep.

426
00:38:13,304 --> 00:38:15,363
I do not care.

427
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,433
Nope, nope...
nope.

428
00:38:20,612 --> 00:38:24,844
Well, it's better than
looking for little creatures
who probably don't even exist.

429
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:26,907
Come on.

430
00:38:41,466 --> 00:38:44,924
- Huh?

431
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:54,874
Whew.

432
00:39:00,885 --> 00:39:04,446
<i>
Where he go?
He can't move that fast.</i>

433
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:18,066
Not again?

434
00:39:18,136 --> 00:39:22,630
We expectin' anybody else
to drop in tonight?

435
00:39:22,707 --> 00:39:24,800
Huh?

436
00:39:26,878 --> 00:39:30,746
We found 'em.

437
00:39:34,085 --> 00:39:39,387
These are sneaky, mean little longnecks?

438
00:39:39,457 --> 00:39:42,255
Ohhh.

439
00:39:45,463 --> 00:39:47,397
Excuse me.

440
00:39:47,465 --> 00:39:51,026
<i>Whoa.
You are short, aren't you?</i>

441
00:39:51,102 --> 00:39:53,332
I used to be taller.

442
00:39:53,404 --> 00:39:57,898
We gotta go tell grown-ups quick,
so we can be the first
and get the special treat.

443
00:39:57,975 --> 00:40:02,969
Yep, yep, yep!
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

444
00:40:03,047 --> 00:40:07,006
Don't do it, guys.
Don't tell on 'em.

445
00:40:07,085 --> 00:40:10,452
<i>Don't worry. We won't.</i>

446
00:40:10,521 --> 00:40:14,184
Just how big of a fool
do you take me for?

447
00:40:14,258 --> 00:40:17,125
Uh, not very?

448
00:40:17,195 --> 00:40:22,360
But Tops... Uh, me mean, Cera's dad,
he wanna hear all about it.

449
00:40:22,433 --> 00:40:26,369
That's right.
That's exactly why
we're not gonna tell him.

450
00:40:26,437 --> 00:40:28,371
You mean it?

451
00:40:28,439 --> 00:40:30,737
Wo-Won't your dad get mad?

452
00:40:30,808 --> 00:40:33,470
What do I care
if they ate the tree sweets?

453
00:40:33,544 --> 00:40:35,808
I wasn't gonna get
the first one anyway.

454
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,316
There is something going on
between Cera and Topsy...

455
00:40:39,383 --> 00:40:41,874
that I do not understand.

456
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:51,150
You don't have
to worry about us.

457
00:40:51,229 --> 00:40:53,163
We won't give you away.

458
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,727
You know what, young lady?
I believe you.

459
00:41:02,673 --> 00:41:06,268
Me no think they look
so sneaky and mean after all.

460
00:41:06,344 --> 00:41:10,440
You want us to show you
some of our secret places?
Uh-huh.

461
00:41:10,515 --> 00:41:13,746
- Sure.
- I would normally say no,

462
00:41:13,818 --> 00:41:16,184
but you're gonna
do it anyway.

463
00:41:16,254 --> 00:41:19,621
So I might as well
save myself the effort.

464
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:24,494
<i>Come on!
</i>

465
00:41:25,696 --> 00:41:28,563
<i>
Come on, Spike.</i>

466
00:41:32,804 --> 00:41:35,602
Hmm.

467
00:41:38,943 --> 00:41:42,106
So, your dad
gets mad a lot?

468
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,841
Oh, yeah.

469
00:41:43,915 --> 00:41:45,849
Mine too.

470
00:41:47,418 --> 00:41:50,046
Sounds like we've got
something in common.

471
00:41:55,526 --> 00:41:58,518
Hmm. Can't be too careful.

472
00:41:58,596 --> 00:42:00,530
Rainin' big ones around here.

473
00:42:08,139 --> 00:42:10,607
Whoo! Whoo!

474
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,339
<i>Who wants a ride?</i>

475
00:42:25,923 --> 00:42:28,790
<i>
Hey, come on.!</i>

476
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:33,923
<i>Follow the leader!
Come on.! Come on.! Come on.!
Let's go.!</i>

477
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:50,513
<i>
Come on.! Move it, Spike.!</i>

478
00:43:05,029 --> 00:43:08,658
Ah-Ah-Ah-choo!

479
00:43:13,471 --> 00:43:16,133
<i>
Come on, Lizzie.</i>

480
00:43:18,209 --> 00:43:21,235
<i>So your dad's
pretty grumpy too, huh?</i>

481
00:43:21,312 --> 00:43:24,008
Yeah. He really
drives me crazy
sometimes.

482
00:43:24,081 --> 00:43:26,106
He can't take a joke,
for one thing.

483
00:43:26,183 --> 00:43:28,413
Neither can mine.

484
00:43:28,486 --> 00:43:30,420
No sense of humor at all.

485
00:43:30,488 --> 00:43:32,422
It's funny though.

486
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:35,823
He always gets the craziest
when he thinks I'm in trouble.

487
00:43:35,893 --> 00:43:38,623
Same with my dad.

488
00:43:38,696 --> 00:43:41,824
He got so mad when we
made friends with Littlefoot.

489
00:43:42,934 --> 00:43:45,425
I think he was just scared for us.

490
00:43:58,182 --> 00:44:02,710
Dads can be a problem
Dads can be a pain

491
00:44:02,787 --> 00:44:07,383
They always act just like
they think you've got no brain

492
00:44:08,225 --> 00:44:12,559
Sometimes they're enough
to drive a girl insane

493
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:15,224
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

494
00:44:15,299 --> 00:44:18,166
Oh, dads
Oh, dads

495
00:44:18,235 --> 00:44:23,002
They treat you like a baby
like you're so small you'll break

496
00:44:23,074 --> 00:44:25,008
And then they scream and yell

497
00:44:25,076 --> 00:44:28,341
When you make one mistake
Yeah, yeah, yeah

498
00:44:28,412 --> 00:44:32,576
All their rules are more
than any girl can take

499
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:35,118
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

500
00:44:35,186 --> 00:44:37,654
Oh, dads
Oh, dads

501
00:44:38,656 --> 00:44:43,218
Big dads, small dads
I guess it goes for all dads

502
00:44:43,294 --> 00:44:46,092
They drive you crazy
every single day

503
00:44:46,163 --> 00:44:48,097
So crazy
So crazy
So crazy

504
00:44:48,165 --> 00:44:53,728
Fat dads, skinny dads
even little minidads

505
00:44:53,804 --> 00:44:56,329
But you gotta love 'em

506
00:44:56,407 --> 00:45:01,208
Anyway
Anyway

507
00:45:03,147 --> 00:45:08,050
You know it's 'cause they love you
They only want what's best

508
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:10,553
The way they fuss and worry

509
00:45:10,621 --> 00:45:12,589
They make a girl depressed

510
00:45:12,656 --> 00:45:17,593
You wanna tell them
Dad, please
Give it a rest

511
00:45:17,661 --> 00:45:20,095
Oh-oh-oh

512
00:45:20,164 --> 00:45:22,928
Hey, Dad
Hey, Dad

513
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,525
You make me wanna holler

514
00:45:25,603 --> 00:45:27,901
You make me wanna shout

515
00:45:27,972 --> 00:45:32,875
Find somebody else
that you can worry about

516
00:45:32,943 --> 00:45:36,879
-  Please, please
-  Please, oh, please

517
00:45:36,947 --> 00:45:38,972
Don't be such a dad

518
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:42,144
Please, Dad
Don't be such a dad

519
00:45:42,219 --> 00:45:45,746
-  Don't be such a dad
-  Please, Dad

520
00:45:45,823 --> 00:45:48,121
Please, please
Please, please

521
00:45:48,192 --> 00:45:55,655
Please, Dad
Please, Dad

522
00:45:59,503 --> 00:46:02,666
I know my dad wants
the best for me,

523
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:05,675
but sometimes I think
he worries about me too much.

524
00:46:05,743 --> 00:46:08,337
I wish he had
someone else to worry about...

525
00:46:08,412 --> 00:46:12,348
<i>or maybe someone
to help him worry about me.</i>

526
00:46:12,416 --> 00:46:14,441
You know what I mean?

527
00:46:14,518 --> 00:46:17,282
Someone like, well...

528
00:46:17,354 --> 00:46:21,120
Yeah, I know exactly
what you mean.

529
00:46:34,105 --> 00:46:38,439
<i>-  Spike, go.
</i>

530
00:46:50,387 --> 00:46:52,321
See you guys tonight.

531
00:46:52,389 --> 00:46:55,552
We will bring lots to eat.
Yep, yep, yep.

532
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,551
If Spike no eat it first.

533
00:47:04,101 --> 00:47:07,434
<i>Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with us.</i>

534
00:47:08,706 --> 00:47:11,174
Bye, Cera.

535
00:47:11,242 --> 00:47:13,176
Don't worry so much,
Daddy.

536
00:47:13,244 --> 00:47:15,235
We can trust them.

537
00:47:16,814 --> 00:47:18,748
Especially Cera.

538
00:47:18,816 --> 00:47:21,046
I hope you're right, Lizzie.

539
00:47:21,118 --> 00:47:24,019
But there's one thing
you've got to remember
about the big ones.

540
00:47:24,088 --> 00:47:28,923
Just because they're bigger,
they think that makes them
more important.

541
00:47:28,993 --> 00:47:33,225
And sometimes they forget
about the little details...

542
00:47:33,297 --> 00:47:35,288
like us.

543
00:47:56,487 --> 00:47:57,954
<i>
Wake up, Littlefoot.</i>

544
00:47:58,022 --> 00:48:01,014
The great circle
is already rising in the sky.

545
00:48:06,363 --> 00:48:09,264
Gosh. So soon?

546
00:48:17,274 --> 00:48:21,142
Are you two sure
you feel okay this morning?

547
00:48:21,212 --> 00:48:24,204
Uh, we are fine.

548
00:48:24,281 --> 00:48:26,647
Just... fine.

549
00:48:26,717 --> 00:48:29,481
Yep, yep, yep.

550
00:48:49,006 --> 00:48:51,566
Be careful, Petrie.

551
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:23,006
<i>Cera?
</i>

552
00:49:23,073 --> 00:49:27,669
Are you okay, honey?
You look beat.

553
00:49:27,745 --> 00:49:29,679
I'm fine.

554
00:49:37,921 --> 00:49:42,051
Look, Cera, I have tried
every way I know
to be nice to you,

555
00:49:42,126 --> 00:49:44,720
<i>but you've shrugged me off.</i>

556
00:49:44,795 --> 00:49:47,628
Fine. I'm a big girl.
I can take it.

557
00:49:47,698 --> 00:49:50,064
But I like your dad.
I always did.

558
00:49:50,134 --> 00:49:54,161
And he likes me, and I think
we're good for each other.

559
00:49:54,238 --> 00:49:56,229
And I could be good
for you, too...

560
00:49:56,307 --> 00:49:59,743
<i>if you'd let me.</i>

561
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:04,907
I could be someone who'd help your dad
worry about you, you know?

562
00:50:07,117 --> 00:50:09,585
I was hoping
we could be friends,

563
00:50:09,653 --> 00:50:11,985
but I guess that's up to you.

564
00:50:17,861 --> 00:50:20,091
Tria, wait.

565
00:50:21,598 --> 00:50:24,658
Maybe we could give it a try...

566
00:50:25,803 --> 00:50:27,930
being friends.

567
00:50:38,415 --> 00:50:40,440
Mm!

568
00:50:51,995 --> 00:50:53,963
Do you think
they'll come back tonight?

569
00:50:55,632 --> 00:50:59,398
Sure. Littlefoot said they would.
Don't you trust him?

570
00:51:00,771 --> 00:51:02,705
Mm-hmm.

571
00:51:13,016 --> 00:51:14,950
Hey, guys! Wait up.

572
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:19,419
Tonight, me tickle Rocky.

573
00:51:20,791 --> 00:51:24,158
<i>See how he likes it.</i>

574
00:51:24,228 --> 00:51:27,595
First we have to find
the best tree stars to take 'em.

575
00:51:28,665 --> 00:51:31,190
<i>Where do you kids think
you're going this time of night?</i>

576
00:51:35,472 --> 00:51:38,964
<i>I don't know, Daddy.
Where do you think you're going?</i>

577
00:51:39,042 --> 00:51:41,943
Wha... Huh? Who, me?

578
00:51:42,012 --> 00:51:45,175
Well, honey, I'm-I'm...
I'm just, uh...

579
00:51:45,249 --> 00:51:47,774
I'm on guard duty.
That's what.

580
00:51:47,851 --> 00:51:50,684
Too big a job to leave
to anybody else,

581
00:51:50,754 --> 00:51:54,212
what with all the tree stars
disappearing around here.

582
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:57,886
<i>You kids get back to bed.
It's not safe for you
to be wandering around...</i>

583
00:51:57,961 --> 00:52:01,192
with all those tiny longnecks
on the loose.

584
00:52:01,265 --> 00:52:04,291
Oh, Daddy,
they wouldn't hurt anybody.

585
00:52:04,368 --> 00:52:06,700
How do you know?

586
00:52:07,938 --> 00:52:10,805
Oh, I mean...
Well, why would they?

587
00:52:10,874 --> 00:52:13,866
We're so much bigger
than they are.

588
00:52:15,345 --> 00:52:18,712
It's the little ones
you have to worry about.

589
00:52:19,716 --> 00:52:22,116
<i>Now shoo.!
</i>

590
00:52:22,186 --> 00:52:24,313
Skedaddle.
Back home, all of you.

591
00:52:24,388 --> 00:52:27,653
Don't let me catch you
out this late again.

592
00:52:27,724 --> 00:52:30,522
Now move!

593
00:53:11,935 --> 00:53:14,267
<i>Lizzie, where you goin'?</i>

594
00:53:14,338 --> 00:53:18,206
<i>Lizzie.! This is bad.
This is really bad.</i>

595
00:53:25,282 --> 00:53:27,614
Hmm.

596
00:53:42,366 --> 00:53:46,063
<i>
Halt! Who goes there?</i>

597
00:53:46,136 --> 00:53:48,263
Shh.

598
00:53:48,338 --> 00:53:50,272
It's just me, Topsy.

599
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:52,331
Oh, Tria.

600
00:53:53,911 --> 00:53:56,709
Now, I'm going to tell you
what I told Cera.

601
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,771
It's not safe for you
to be out here...

602
00:53:58,849 --> 00:54:01,647
with all these little creatures
wandering around.

603
00:54:01,718 --> 00:54:05,484
Oh, come on, Topsy.
Loosen up. Live a little.

604
00:54:05,556 --> 00:54:07,683
Admit it.
You're glad to see me.

605
00:54:07,758 --> 00:54:11,421
Well, I...
Of course I'm glad, but, uh...

606
00:54:11,495 --> 00:54:15,158
- But I'm on duty.

607
00:54:15,232 --> 00:54:18,497
Oh, well. You can't
blame a girl for trying.

608
00:54:19,736 --> 00:54:23,832
Walk me back.
Oh. Okay.

609
00:54:26,543 --> 00:54:30,479
No. I can't do it.
It's my job to stay here...

610
00:54:30,547 --> 00:54:32,742
and look for those little...

611
00:54:36,219 --> 00:54:39,655
Oh! It's so cute.

612
00:54:39,723 --> 00:54:42,283
Lizzie!

613
00:54:45,395 --> 00:54:49,092
You little... I'll teach ya,
you tree-sweet stealers.

614
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:52,624
- Come back here!
- Topsy! Leave them alone.

615
00:54:55,405 --> 00:54:58,772
Mm!

616
00:55:04,114 --> 00:55:07,083
Did they get away?

617
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:09,084
For now.

618
00:55:10,087 --> 00:55:12,988
Good.

619
00:55:13,056 --> 00:55:15,388
But now we know
where to find them.

620
00:55:23,066 --> 00:55:25,000
And though I gave chase,

621
00:55:25,068 --> 00:55:28,435
the vicious little vermin
narrowly escaped.

622
00:55:28,505 --> 00:55:31,372
But I found their lair.

623
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:34,171
<i>
Yeah.! Yeah.!</i>

624
00:55:35,712 --> 00:55:37,646
<i>Now we can return
to their hideout...</i>

625
00:55:37,714 --> 00:55:42,310
<i>and rid the Great Valley
of this scourge forever.!</i>

626
00:55:42,386 --> 00:55:43,819
Oh, no!

627
00:55:43,887 --> 00:55:46,151
No! They're not like he said!

628
00:55:46,223 --> 00:55:51,525
- What?
- Sure, they're little,
but they're cute and... frightened.

629
00:55:51,595 --> 00:55:55,861
We should just...
leave them alone.

630
00:55:55,932 --> 00:55:59,095
If you don't know
what you're talking about,
you shouldn't talk at all.

631
00:55:59,169 --> 00:56:00,727
What?

632
00:56:02,506 --> 00:56:05,373
I say we go to their hideout
and seal it up with rocks.

633
00:56:05,442 --> 00:56:08,036
<i>
Yeah.! Come on.!</i>

634
00:56:10,447 --> 00:56:12,711
Everyone! Please!

635
00:56:12,783 --> 00:56:16,549
We should talk this over.
Please, listen to me.

636
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:18,611
Keep movin'!

637
00:56:18,689 --> 00:56:21,123
Grandpa, we've gotta
stop 'em.

638
00:56:21,191 --> 00:56:24,558
Yes. Yes, Littlefoot, but how?

639
00:56:29,399 --> 00:56:31,697
I know how.

640
00:56:35,338 --> 00:56:38,273
- There it is right there.
- That's the place.

641
00:56:41,511 --> 00:56:44,639
-  Push!

642
00:56:44,715 --> 00:56:47,809
Push!

643
00:56:49,853 --> 00:56:53,812
Come on!
Keep pushing! Keep pushing!
Come on!

644
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:57,883
<i>
Please! Listen to me!</i>

645
00:56:57,961 --> 00:57:00,589
Everyone! Please!

646
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:22,216
Stop! Please!

647
00:57:22,285 --> 00:57:24,515
You're making a big mistake!

648
00:57:24,588 --> 00:57:28,115
I'm the one who took all the tree sweets
off the tree-sweets tree.

649
00:57:28,191 --> 00:57:30,455
Huh?

650
00:57:32,028 --> 00:57:34,963
What?
What are you talking about?

651
00:57:35,031 --> 00:57:38,000
- What say?
- What is he saying?

652
00:57:38,068 --> 00:57:40,832
I didn't mean to.

653
00:57:40,904 --> 00:57:43,372
The tiny longnecks
ate the tree sweets,

654
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,342
but they wouldn't have
if I hadn't knocked them
all off the tree.

655
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:49,742
<i>I was gonna tell the truth,</i>

656
00:57:49,813 --> 00:57:53,749
<i>but when I saw
how mad everybody was,
I got scared.</i>

657
00:57:53,817 --> 00:57:58,220
<i>So I blamed everything
on the tiny longnecks.
</i>

658
00:57:58,288 --> 00:58:03,351
Do you still trust
the big ones now?

659
00:58:03,426 --> 00:58:07,260
Anyway, I know now
that they're nice.

660
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:09,321
They're really nice.

661
00:58:09,399 --> 00:58:13,165
And I...

662
00:58:13,236 --> 00:58:15,170
I'm sorry.

663
00:58:23,647 --> 00:58:25,877
Well,

664
00:58:25,949 --> 00:58:29,146
I suggest we all just go home...

665
00:58:29,219 --> 00:58:32,518
and leave these little creatures
in peace.

666
00:58:36,026 --> 00:58:38,187
Come on.
Let's go.
Yeah.

667
00:59:17,634 --> 00:59:20,762
Well, come, little one.

668
00:59:20,837 --> 00:59:22,828
Time for sleep.

669
00:59:46,029 --> 00:59:48,589
<i>
Oh, no.!</i>

670
00:59:48,665 --> 00:59:52,260
Look out! Hurry!

671
00:59:56,206 --> 00:59:59,642
<i>
Oh, the poor little things.</i>

672
00:59:59,709 --> 01:00:01,472
I'm sorry, Littlefoot.

673
01:00:45,288 --> 01:00:49,418
If only I could start all over

674
01:00:49,492 --> 01:00:52,950
And take things back somehow

675
01:00:53,029 --> 01:00:58,558
I wouldn't have lied
or tried to hide

676
01:00:58,635 --> 01:01:03,663
If I knew then
what I know now

677
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:07,642
If I did something wrong
I'd own up

678
01:01:08,812 --> 01:01:12,509
Even if I was afraid

679
01:01:12,582 --> 01:01:19,215
Now my friends are sad
'cause of the mess I made

680
01:01:21,191 --> 01:01:26,128
Strange how little things
like lies

681
01:01:26,196 --> 01:01:28,858
Keep growing taller

682
01:01:28,932 --> 01:01:34,097
Until one day
you lose your way

683
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:38,038
<i>And troubles get bigger</i>

684
01:01:38,108 --> 01:01:40,372
<i>While you get smaller</i>

685
01:01:50,286 --> 01:01:54,780
If I could get it right
the first time

686
01:01:54,858 --> 01:01:58,294
I'd never have to make mistakes

687
01:01:58,361 --> 01:02:03,264
But then you'd never grow
and never know

688
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:06,598
The courage living takes

689
01:02:07,804 --> 01:02:11,467
If only you remember

690
01:02:11,541 --> 01:02:15,443
To think with your heart
Why then

691
01:02:15,512 --> 01:02:19,312
You'll never have to say
If only

692
01:02:19,382 --> 01:02:23,910
I'll never have to say
If only

693
01:02:23,987 --> 01:02:29,425
I'll never have to say, if only
You'll never have to say, if only

694
01:02:29,492 --> 01:02:34,088
Again

695
01:02:40,503 --> 01:02:42,903
If only.

696
01:02:59,823 --> 01:03:02,621
I don't recognize
this tunnel at all.

697
01:03:02,692 --> 01:03:07,129
Hmm. Must have just been created
by the big rockfall that closed our way out.

698
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,025
Which way...
Do we go?

699
01:03:16,406 --> 01:03:18,397
This way.

700
01:03:19,409 --> 01:03:22,708
But this'll take us away
from Cera and the others.

701
01:03:24,047 --> 01:03:27,039
Oh, that's the whole idea.

702
01:03:44,467 --> 01:03:47,402
Hi, guys.

703
01:03:49,572 --> 01:03:51,904
Are you really that mad at me?

704
01:03:53,743 --> 01:03:58,942
Well, why? I mean, I can understand
the grown-ups and the tiny longnecks,

705
01:03:59,015 --> 01:04:01,142
but why are you guys mad?

706
01:04:02,385 --> 01:04:06,048
I do not know if I can say it
all like I hear it in my head.

707
01:04:06,122 --> 01:04:08,056
Me neither.

708
01:04:08,124 --> 01:04:10,786
Me mad, but hard to tell why.

709
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:13,226
Yeah, mm-hmm.

710
01:04:13,296 --> 01:04:16,732
I will try if you want.
Me too.

711
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:21,668
Well, okay.
Go ahead, I guess.

712
01:04:21,738 --> 01:04:24,468
You messed up the tree-sweets tree,

713
01:04:24,541 --> 01:04:28,170
so I did not get any tree sweets,
and neither did anybody else.

714
01:04:28,244 --> 01:04:30,178
Mm-hmm.

715
01:04:30,246 --> 01:04:33,306
You make friends with tiny ones,
but you make everybody mad at them...

716
01:04:33,383 --> 01:04:35,408
so they unhappy now too.

717
01:04:35,485 --> 01:04:39,751
So why you make friends with them
in the firstest place?
Mm-hmm.

718
01:04:39,822 --> 01:04:44,316
You made the grown-ups so mad
that they knocked rocks down
on the tiny little longnecks...

719
01:04:44,394 --> 01:04:46,385
so they are now covered up
with rocks,

720
01:04:46,462 --> 01:04:48,862
and I do not think
that is fair either.

721
01:04:48,932 --> 01:04:54,837
Plus Spike eated all the bestest
tree stars me found this morning.

722
01:04:54,904 --> 01:04:56,895
Mm-hmm.

723
01:04:56,973 --> 01:05:00,272
I didn't do that.
Spike did.

724
01:05:01,978 --> 01:05:06,472
- Hmm?
- In that case, me done.

725
01:05:06,549 --> 01:05:10,952
I am done too.
Mm-hmm.

726
01:05:12,822 --> 01:05:16,349
For folks who didn't think
they could explain how they felt,

727
01:05:16,426 --> 01:05:19,088
you did a pretty good job.

728
01:05:21,164 --> 01:05:24,930
So, is that it?
You guys won't even talk to me?

729
01:05:25,001 --> 01:05:27,162
You hear somebody?
Me no hear nobody.

730
01:05:27,237 --> 01:05:29,171
I do not hear nobody either.

731
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:32,674
Fine!

732
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:49,920
Tria?
Oh, hi, Cera.

733
01:05:49,993 --> 01:05:52,257
You're not mad at me, are you?

734
01:05:52,328 --> 01:05:55,092
I mean, about the tiny longnecks.

735
01:05:55,164 --> 01:05:57,428
I think my dad is.

736
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:59,434
Oh, honey, no.

737
01:05:59,502 --> 01:06:01,766
I think it's sweet
that you made friends with them.

738
01:06:01,838 --> 01:06:05,535
They're cute.
It's your father I'm mad at.

739
01:06:05,608 --> 01:06:08,338
'Cause he yelled at you
in front of everybody?

740
01:06:08,411 --> 01:06:13,849
Well, that. But, mainly,
I just got tired of him
being so mean to the tiny ones.

741
01:06:13,916 --> 01:06:16,680
He didn't used to be so mean.

742
01:06:16,753 --> 01:06:21,156
Hmm. He always was handsome though.

743
01:06:26,429 --> 01:06:31,128
You know what I think?
I think he did it... for you.

744
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,498
Hmm? Come again?

745
01:06:33,569 --> 01:06:37,835
He wanted to show you
how much he likes you
by giving you the first tree sweet.

746
01:06:37,907 --> 01:06:41,399
And when the tiny longnecks
ate 'em all, he couldn't.

747
01:06:41,477 --> 01:06:44,878
I think Dad felt like they stole
those tree sweets from you.

748
01:06:44,947 --> 01:06:46,881
And that's why
he doesn't like them...

749
01:06:46,949 --> 01:06:49,247
<i>'cause ofhow much
he likes you.</i>

750
01:07:12,809 --> 01:07:16,176
Well, at least we won't have
big ones chasing us all the time.

751
01:07:21,484 --> 01:07:23,418
Of course, I could be wrong.

752
01:07:23,486 --> 01:07:25,954
Run!

753
01:08:06,996 --> 01:08:08,793
In there!

754
01:08:32,021 --> 01:08:37,755
But those sharpteeth are heading
toward the Great Valley.
I know. That's why we're not.

755
01:08:37,827 --> 01:08:40,318
But what about our friends?

756
01:08:41,564 --> 01:08:44,863
They're big enough
to take care of themselves.
Now come on.

757
01:08:52,675 --> 01:08:56,202
Huh. Who needs friends anyway?

758
01:08:56,279 --> 01:09:00,010
I'm big enough
to take care of myself.

759
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:17,463
Me no believe you talk
to Littlefoot like that.

760
01:09:17,533 --> 01:09:19,330
You so mean.

761
01:09:19,402 --> 01:09:22,132
Oh! I am not meaner than you.

762
01:09:22,205 --> 01:09:24,605
- You are the one
who made him the saddest.

763
01:09:24,674 --> 01:09:26,835
<i>Yep,yep,yep.</i>

764
01:09:26,909 --> 01:09:29,969
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

765
01:09:30,046 --> 01:09:33,709
But me no want to make him sad.

766
01:09:33,783 --> 01:09:37,219
Me Littlefoot's bestest friend.

767
01:09:37,286 --> 01:09:40,414
Me too.

768
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:43,857
I am his bestest friend too.

769
01:09:49,565 --> 01:09:51,760
Now that's a disgusting sight.

770
01:09:53,336 --> 01:09:57,602
We-We chase Littlefoot off.

771
01:09:57,673 --> 01:10:01,109
Don't just sit there crying about it.
Make it better.

772
01:10:01,177 --> 01:10:04,078
Go find him
and tell him you're sorry.

773
01:10:04,146 --> 01:10:08,014
How-How come you
so smart all of a sudden...

774
01:10:08,084 --> 01:10:10,018
<i>about making things better?</i>

775
01:10:10,086 --> 01:10:13,613
I've just gotten
some practice lately.

776
01:10:13,689 --> 01:10:16,385
<i>- Hey. There's Littlefoot now.
- Littlefoot?</i>

777
01:10:16,459 --> 01:10:19,189
Hey, Littlefoot.

778
01:10:45,621 --> 01:10:48,886
Leave her alone,
you big bully!

779
01:10:48,958 --> 01:10:51,654
Don't just stand there.
Run!

780
01:11:01,904 --> 01:11:03,838
Let's go, Ducky!

781
01:11:03,906 --> 01:11:06,773
I am so, so, so, so sorry
for what I said.

782
01:11:06,842 --> 01:11:11,279
Really. Really so, so...
Tell me about it later, okay?

783
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:27,125
Ha, ha! Missed me!

784
01:11:34,837 --> 01:11:39,035
- Lizzie. Skitter.

785
01:11:41,577 --> 01:11:43,568
<i>
Over here.! Over here.!</i>

786
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:48,038
Run, kids!
I can handle this guy.

787
01:11:48,117 --> 01:11:50,142
Maybe.

788
01:11:56,592 --> 01:11:59,322
Back off!

789
01:11:59,395 --> 01:12:01,625
She's with me.

790
01:12:01,697 --> 01:12:03,790
Oh, Topsy.

791
01:12:03,866 --> 01:12:06,334
I love it
when you act all brave.

792
01:12:08,571 --> 01:12:11,335
- Daddy!

793
01:12:17,546 --> 01:12:19,571
Whoa!
Whoa!

794
01:12:23,486 --> 01:12:26,387
Lizzie! Skitter!
You okay?

795
01:12:35,598 --> 01:12:37,657
<i>
Hey.! You.!</i>

796
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:44,201
Why don't you pick on somebody
your own size?

797
01:12:48,244 --> 01:12:52,943
Wow. They came back,
all of them.
I can't believe it.

798
01:13:12,001 --> 01:13:15,368
Hang on, little ones.
I'm coming!

799
01:13:20,309 --> 01:13:22,641
<i>
This way.! Run.! This way.!</i>

800
01:13:26,615 --> 01:13:28,742
Stay behind me, kids.

801
01:14:19,902 --> 01:14:21,665
<i>
That should do it.</i>

802
01:14:25,074 --> 01:14:29,033
<i>
Well, they won't
come back that way.</i>

803
01:14:29,111 --> 01:14:32,444
<i>I still can't believe
you came back to help us.</i>

804
01:14:32,515 --> 01:14:36,315
Well, sure.
You're our friends.

805
01:14:37,586 --> 01:14:42,888
I'm, uh... Well, I'm sorry
for all the trouble that I caused.

806
01:14:42,958 --> 01:14:46,621
Hey, you're a dad.
That's what we do.

807
01:14:46,695 --> 01:14:49,926
But you also saved
my daughter's life,

808
01:14:49,999 --> 01:14:52,058
and for that I'm grateful.

809
01:14:54,069 --> 01:14:56,299
Way to go, Topsy.

810
01:14:56,372 --> 01:14:59,000
You're the big hero.

811
01:15:01,477 --> 01:15:05,311
I'm sorry. We had to seal up
that new tunnel.

812
01:15:05,381 --> 01:15:08,680
<i>We don't want any sharpteeth
getting back in.</i>

813
01:15:08,751 --> 01:15:11,879
Great! That means
you've gotta stay.

814
01:15:15,024 --> 01:15:19,586
Well, I guess, if we gotta,
you know, we gotta.

815
01:15:25,501 --> 01:15:29,403
Besides, who'd wanna leave
friends like you?

816
01:15:47,289 --> 01:15:50,190
<i>
The next time
the tree sweets were in bloom,</i>

817
01:15:50,259 --> 01:15:53,592
<i>all of the dinosaurs
gathered for Nibbling Day.</i>

818
01:16:08,143 --> 01:16:11,635
Did you see, Grandpa?
I could reach.

819
01:16:11,714 --> 01:16:13,705
I'm bigger now.

820
01:16:13,782 --> 01:16:17,115
Littlefoot, you grew bigger...

821
01:16:17,186 --> 01:16:20,087
the day you stood up
in front of everyone...

822
01:16:20,155 --> 01:16:22,282
and admitted you were wrong.

823
01:16:28,898 --> 01:16:33,232
<i>
Now that we're all gathered,
let's eat some tree sweets, shall we?</i>

824
01:17:00,095 --> 01:17:02,029
Yeah!

825

<i>
And every Nibbling Day,
the dinosaurs of the Great Valley...</i>

<i>gathered to celebrate
these small things oflife...</i>

827
01:17:13,709 --> 01:17:15,802
<i>which mattered so much.</i>

828
01:17:23,118 --> 01:17:26,110
