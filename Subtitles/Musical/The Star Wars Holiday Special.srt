1
00:00:59,797 --> 00:01:01,668
That's it, I'm turning back.

2
00:01:03,423 --> 00:01:05,300
I know your family's waiting.

3
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,565
I know it's an important day.

4
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:14,135
All right. We'll give it a try. I'll set
short coordinates,

5
00:01:14,635 --> 00:01:15,815
we won't jump far.

6
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,166
I'll get you back there in time, pal.
Trust me.

7
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:24,068
Our only hope now, is
to outrun that Imperial

8
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:26,167
garbage scow, tho'. I'm
going to lightspeed.

9
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:32,049
That's the spirit! You'll be celebrating
Life Day before you know it!

10
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:35,588
Standby, here's where we say
goodbye to our unpleasant friends.

11
00:01:42,992 --> 00:01:46,708
A long time ago in a galaxy
far far away...

00:11:39,943 --> 00:11:41,523
YOU HAVE REACHED TRAFFIC

33
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:00,266

34
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,060
What's that?

35
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,583
Oh, Artoo, look.
It's Chewbacca's family.

36
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:32,606
Here, keep working on it.

37
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,291
Hello Malla, Itchy.

38
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,592
Hiya Lumpy.

39
00:12:37,122 --> 00:12:38,719
Where's Chewbacca?

40
00:12:43,754 --> 00:12:45,951
Whoa, wait a minute! One at a time.

41
00:12:58,103 --> 00:12:58,699
Yeah...

42
00:13:00,123 --> 00:13:01,375
Not now, Artoo.

43
00:13:05,235 --> 00:13:07,635
Uh, wait a minute, I don't like the
looks of this. Let me get this fixed.

44
00:13:08,586 --> 00:13:11,497
Oh, Artoo, you're supposed to be
watching that...

45
00:13:14,277 --> 00:13:17,688
There, that ought to hold it.
I think.

46
00:13:19,616 --> 00:13:20,970
What's up?

47
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,780
Chewbacca...

48
00:13:22,955 --> 00:13:25,171
Yeah, well, bring him to the screen.
I want to say hello to him.

49
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:29,661
You don't know where he is?

50
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:32,994
Oh, he's not there yet. Is that it?

51
00:13:34,062 --> 00:13:35,314
Oh boy.

52
00:13:36,644 --> 00:13:41,689
Well, all I can tell you is that,
uh, he and Han left here on schedule.

53
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,082
If he's not there now,
they're way overdue.

54
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:46,894
There must've been trouble.

55
00:13:53,553 --> 00:13:55,251
Artoo, please, this is important.

56
00:13:55,784 --> 00:13:57,595
Now, now listen. Calm down.
I mean...

57
00:13:57,596 --> 00:14:00,026
you know how Han and
Chewbacca are anything

58
00:14:00,027 --> 00:14:02,562
could've happened - they
could've, they could've stopped

59
00:14:02,563 --> 00:14:05,097
off somewhere, or been held
up by an asteroid storm.

60
00:14:05,592 --> 00:14:06,521
Listen,

61
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,890
I wouldn't worry about
Chewbacca, I know him

62
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,939
and he hasn't missed a
Life Day yet, right?

63
00:14:11,543 --> 00:14:14,042
Well, there you go! He's not going to
miss this one either.

64
00:14:14,592 --> 00:14:18,099
It's just taking him a little longer to
get there, that's all. He'll make it.

65
00:14:19,515 --> 00:14:21,213
Come on, don't look so worried.

66
00:14:21,214 --> 00:14:24,499
Now, Chewie's not gonna wanna come home
to a house full of long faces, is he?

67
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,503
Come on, Malla.
Let's see a little smile.

68
00:14:29,711 --> 00:14:30,787
Come on...

69
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:33,727
There, that's better.

70
00:14:33,728 --> 00:14:35,472
Try to enjoy your Life Day.

71
00:14:35,578 --> 00:14:38,375
I gotta get back to this engine.
I think we might have it solved.

72
00:14:39,675 --> 00:14:42,804
OH! ARTOO!
What are you doing?!

73
00:14:43,747 --> 00:14:45,444
What are you doing?!

74
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,780
Oh no...

75
00:14:52,077 --> 00:14:55,271
It's alright. Nobody's perfect.

80
00:15:47,324 --> 00:15:49,692
Hello, an Imperial Guard.

81
00:15:50,344 --> 00:15:52,024
I suppose you
want to see my identification.

82
00:15:52,025 --> 00:15:55,989
No, I'm off duty. I've come
to look around your shop.

83
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,225
Well, good, good, good.

84
00:15:57,226 --> 00:15:59,738
Look around,
browse around, make yourself at home...

85
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:03,644
As you can see I've got just about
everything a man or wookiee would want.

86
00:16:06,214 --> 00:16:07,047
Oh here,

87
00:16:07,552 --> 00:16:09,451
let me show you this; I really
love this.

88
00:16:14,282 --> 00:16:15,314
No...

89
00:16:21,254 --> 00:16:22,398
Ah, here we are. Here it is.

90
00:16:23,887 --> 00:16:25,255
A pocket sized aquarium.

91
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:26,959
Wonderful, isn't it?

92
00:16:31,726 --> 00:16:33,306
And, you can take it with you anywhere.

93
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:35,724
And the tank is a snap to clean.

94
00:16:35,725 --> 00:16:37,158
I hate fish.

95
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:38,996
Well, so do I, as a matter of fact.

96
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:40,375
I take a drink once and a while,

97
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,732
but I just thought I'd
show you some of the

98
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:45,548
stupid stuff those
wookiees purchase from me.

99
00:16:46,178 --> 00:16:47,023
Oh, here...

100
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:52,098
Here's a hot little item that seems to
be moving pretty rapidly these days.

101
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,902
Excuse me, I got a wall screen customer.

102
00:16:58,887 --> 00:16:59,959
Good to see you again.

103
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,299
Don't worry Malla.

104
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,772
I know just why you're calling.

105
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:06,895
You're wondering when that shaggy carpet
you ordered will arrive at your home.

106
00:17:07,749 --> 00:17:10,368
Let me assure you madam,
it's on its way.

107
00:17:11,191 --> 00:17:14,521
You know, it was made especially for you
by a little old woman four planets away.

108
00:17:15,472 --> 00:17:17,181
She did it all by herself.

109
00:17:17,182 --> 00:17:20,462
In fact, you
might say she did it by Han... Solo.

110
00:17:22,922 --> 00:17:24,705
Tho' it's going to take some time to get
to you.

111
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,784
I know you'll understand.

112
00:17:28,598 --> 00:17:29,991
You understand don't you?

113
00:17:30,337 --> 00:17:31,292
Terrific!

114
00:17:31,493 --> 00:17:36,148
By the way, I'll be by later to
drop off that extra proton energy pack.

115
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,828
You're welcome.

116
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,861
What's a matter?
Don't you like this?

117
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,273
It's just a groomer.

118
00:17:45,561 --> 00:17:47,572
- Just a groomer?
- A groomer..

119
00:17:47,773 --> 00:17:49,326
Just a groomer, you say?

120
00:17:51,847 --> 00:17:53,089
It's a lot more than that.

121
00:17:54,182 --> 00:17:55,879
Evidently, you haven't
read the instructions,

122
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,575
the warranty, and the guarantee.

123
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,858
Besides shaving and hair trimming.
It's guaranteed

124
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:02,139
to lift stains off clothing,
faces, and hands.

125
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,150
Cleans teeth, fingers, and toenails.

126
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:08,363
Washes eyes, pierces ears, calculates,
modulates, and syncopates like rhythms

127
00:18:08,364 --> 00:18:11,766
and can repeat the entire Imperial Code,
all 17 volumes,

128
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:14,389
in half the time of the
old XP-21.

129
00:18:15,314 --> 00:18:17,871
Just the thing to keep
you squeaky clean.

130
00:18:18,072 --> 00:18:19,922
I use one of these all the time.

131
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:22,163
Really?

132
00:18:22,746 --> 00:18:23,955
Well, not all the time,

133
00:18:24,555 --> 00:18:26,338
but some of the time.

134
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,927
Oh, another outstanding, uh, feature
of this little model

135
00:18:28,928 --> 00:18:33,192
you can recharge it by simply plugging
it into any ordinary laser outlet.

136
00:18:33,193 --> 00:18:34,194
I'll take it.

137
00:18:34,195 --> 00:18:35,295
Good! I thought you would.

138
00:18:36,178 --> 00:18:38,689
Well, would you
like to pay me something

139
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:41,137
for it or give me something in trade?

140
00:18:41,138 --> 00:18:43,588
I said I'll take it!

141
00:18:45,026 --> 00:18:46,446
That's a load off my mind.

142
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,200
I thought I might embarrass

143
00:18:49,201 --> 00:18:51,490
you when I told you it was a gift.

144
00:18:52,844 --> 00:18:54,196
I don't like embarrassing people

145
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:57,549
I don't like being embarrassed
myself that's why I,

146
00:18:57,584 --> 00:18:59,813
uh, don't like to embarrass people.

147
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,470
I just said that...

148
00:19:06,968 --> 00:19:08,248
just a groomer...

149
00:19:12,722 --> 00:19:15,408
We've ordered a blockade and a curfew.

150
00:19:15,506 --> 00:19:16,822
And, started a search operation.

151
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,712
It's just a matter of time
before we find the Rebels.

152
00:19:19,713 --> 00:19:22,773
I want the Rebels
located and identified.

153
00:19:22,774 --> 00:19:25,722
If it means searching every household in
the system.

154
00:21:57,023 --> 00:21:58,917
Hello...

155
00:22:00,706 --> 00:22:03,642
Today we are going to
be preparing a very

156
00:22:03,643 --> 00:22:06,578
succulent dish called
"Bantha Surprise."

157
00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:08,770
It's not only a very hearty, nourishing
dish,

158
00:22:08,771 --> 00:22:11,012
but it's very economical, too.
So all those

159
00:22:11,013 --> 00:22:13,252
hungry mouths in your
household will be going

160
00:22:13,253 --> 00:22:16,169
"yummy yum for their tummy
tum." If you just follow

161
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:19,084
along with me as I prepare
this popular favorite.

162
00:22:19,491 --> 00:22:20,934
Now, today

163
00:22:20,969 --> 00:22:25,625
I'm going to be using the
tenderest cut of the bantha: the loin.

164
00:22:25,626 --> 00:22:28,603
The loin is very tasty and serves four
nicely.

165
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,791
But, of course, if your family
has a hearty appetite,

166
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:37,061
I would suggest then that old popular
holiday favorite: The Bantha Rump.

167
00:22:42,005 --> 00:22:43,896
Um, very tender.

168
00:22:45,018 --> 00:22:47,736
Ah, we just slice into
bite-sized pieces.

169
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:55,336
And only you know the size of a bite in
your family!

170
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,094
Oh! Alright,

171
00:23:00,095 --> 00:23:02,219
now it's time to put our chunks

172
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:07,325
into our pots.

173
00:23:09,322 --> 00:23:11,049
Nicely... nicely...

174
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,539
Add a dash of negavo.

175
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:13,985
Umm, very good.

176
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:15,769
A sprig of celentery.

177
00:23:16,308 --> 00:23:20,907
Umm, umm, just a bit of
turshum, always nice.

178
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:25,090
And, uh. Um! Turshum is nice!

179
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,507
And, just a little whisper of chelchum.

180
00:23:29,443 --> 00:23:31,077
Ah, looking very nice.

181
00:23:32,838 --> 00:23:33,938
Guess what I forgot?

182
00:23:36,313 --> 00:23:38,353
A bit of the calarantrum root!

183
00:23:39,493 --> 00:23:41,722
Wonderful! Just adds
that touch of piquancy.

184
00:23:42,775 --> 00:23:43,333
There we go.

185
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:45,977
Very nice. Um!

186
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,572
Now we add enough liquid to cover.

187
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:55,891
And guess what we're ready for now:

188
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,904
The cooking! Step one

189
00:23:57,939 --> 00:23:59,896
we stir the mixture.

190
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:03,398
Stir, stir, stir, stir,
stir, stir, stir,

191
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:06,050
stir, stir, stir, stir, very nice.
Now, step

192
00:24:06,051 --> 00:24:08,700
two while we're
stirring, we also whip.

193
00:24:08,701 --> 00:24:13,079
So it's stir, whip, stir, whip, whip,
whip, stir,

194
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,267
stir, whip, stir, whip, whip,
whip, stir.

195
00:24:16,268 --> 00:24:18,440
Now, let's try it again together at
an increased tempo

196
00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:20,498
because precision is very
important in this recipe

197
00:24:20,499 --> 00:24:22,555
and we do want a fine
consistency, don't we?

198
00:24:22,556 --> 00:24:24,688
So, and on the count of one

199
00:24:24,689 --> 00:24:28,189
stir, whip, stir, whip,
whip, whip, stir,

200
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:31,689
stir, whip, stir, whip,
whip, whip, stir.

201
00:24:31,777 --> 00:24:34,225
Come on, faster altogether now. Cooking
can be fun.

202
00:24:34,226 --> 00:24:37,207
Stir, whip, stir, whip,
whip, whip, stir,

203
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:40,188
stir, whip, stir, whip,
whip, whip, stir.

204
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:43,952
Wah! Having fun, having fun, alright.
Having it all nicely, now.

205
00:24:43,953 --> 00:24:46,934
Step three we also have to beat.

206
00:24:46,935 --> 00:24:53,935
So it's: beat, beat, beat, stir, whip,
stir, whip, beat, beat, stir

207
00:24:54,495 --> 00:24:56,116
That's not
right. I'm sorry.

208
00:24:56,117 --> 00:24:59,617
Stir, whip, stir, whip,
whip, whip, stir, beat,

209
00:24:59,618 --> 00:25:03,117
stir, whip, stir, whip,
whip, whip, stir, beat.

210
00:25:08,155 --> 00:25:11,747
Coming... coming along nicely. Mmmm,
starting to have a fine aroma.

211
00:25:17,857 --> 00:25:19,750
Whew, caught it just in time.
Now at this

212
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:21,643
time, I usually like
to taste the broth.

213
00:25:21,678 --> 00:25:24,215
So, we'll have a little taste
and see how it's coming along.

214
00:25:25,084 --> 00:25:28,991
Mmmm, a little bit more turshum. A bit
negavo. A little tunkell.

215
00:25:29,292 --> 00:25:30,443
One for the pot,

216
00:25:31,358 --> 00:25:32,643
Hum! Coming along

217
00:25:33,726 --> 00:25:35,031
Very nice.

218
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:40,912
Oh, wonderful! Coming along nicely...

219
00:26:19,572 --> 00:26:22,898
Alright. Alright, the
coordinates weren't the best.

220
00:26:24,224 --> 00:26:26,854
Out of the frying pan
into the fryer, huh pal?

221
00:26:27,831 --> 00:26:29,647
How should I know we'd
come outta hyperspace

222
00:26:29,648 --> 00:26:31,462
into the middle of an Imperial convoy.

223
00:26:31,463 --> 00:26:33,928
At least against these fighters
we got more of a chance.

224
00:26:34,766 --> 00:26:36,014
However slim...

225
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,973
You can say that again.

226
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,799
This is one Life
Day we won't soon forget.

227
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,000
Wait,

228
00:26:43,289 --> 00:26:45,000
I lost control of the remote cannons.

229
00:26:47,031 --> 00:26:49,930
I'm gonna hafta run back and operate the
aft gun manually. Stay on things here.

230
00:26:49,931 --> 00:26:52,769
Why do I always think that taking you
home for Life Day's gonna be easy?

231
00:27:11,384 --> 00:27:13,812
Attention all viewers.

232
00:27:16,697 --> 00:27:19,354
Due to suspected Rebel activity on the
Kashyyyk planet

233
00:27:19,355 --> 00:27:21,897
the Empire has declared martial law.

234
00:27:22,813 --> 00:27:25,296
A blockade has been set up
around the planet

235
00:27:25,297 --> 00:27:31,176
No ships will be permitted to land
or take off until further notice.

236
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,970
It's me Saundan.

237
00:28:09,691 --> 00:28:10,672
Hi, Itchy.

238
00:28:11,175 --> 00:28:14,835
I brought you that proton pack.
You know, for the, uh, the whatsis

239
00:28:15,508 --> 00:28:18,004
the whatchamalcalit,
the, the thingamabob,

240
00:28:18,261 --> 00:28:20,543
the mind evaporator.
That's it, the mind evaporator.

241
00:28:21,302 --> 00:28:23,189
Boy am I glad to see you folks.

242
00:28:23,893 --> 00:28:26,098
How are my favorite wookiees today?

243
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:30,108
Why all the long hairy faces?

244
00:28:32,092 --> 00:28:34,326
I made it through the Imperial
patrol, didn't I?

245
00:28:36,352 --> 00:28:37,935
If I made it, Chewie and Han will.

246
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,062
Is this all the big hello I get?

247
00:28:46,537 --> 00:28:49,611
I brought you somethin' special short
stuff.

248
00:28:49,612 --> 00:28:50,612
You want it?

249
00:28:50,613 --> 00:28:51,613
You got it.

250
00:28:51,614 --> 00:28:52,614
Happy Life Day.

251
00:28:57,732 --> 00:28:59,716
I love to make a wookiee happy.

252
00:29:00,297 --> 00:29:02,248
And now, for the lovely
lady of the house.

253
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,395
Happy Life Day.

254
00:29:06,304 --> 00:29:07,908
Now wait a, wait a minute, not so fast.

255
00:29:08,258 --> 00:29:10,500
What does an old friend get?

256
00:29:12,274 --> 00:29:13,555
Well?

257
00:29:16,858 --> 00:29:18,296
That's more like it.

258
00:29:59,586 --> 00:30:02,206
Itchy, I know what you'd like.

259
00:30:10,594 --> 00:30:12,806
I'll insert this proton pack.

260
00:30:13,472 --> 00:30:14,627
Now then Itchy,

261
00:30:15,712 --> 00:30:18,294
I thought you might like
this. It's one of those uh...

262
00:30:18,295 --> 00:30:19,295
oh, it's a real...

263
00:30:19,407 --> 00:30:21,283
it's kinda hard to explain...

264
00:30:22,649 --> 00:30:23,908
WOW,

265
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:25,791
if you know what I mean.

266
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:29,335
Put that right in there.

267
00:30:32,324 --> 00:30:34,703
And I do mean happy Life Day.

268
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,368
I know you're searching for me.

269
00:31:51,731 --> 00:31:54,840
Searching, searching... I'm here.

270
00:31:55,962 --> 00:31:58,673
My voice is for you alone.

271
00:31:59,274 --> 00:32:02,268
I am found in your eyes only.

272
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,637
I exist for you alone.

273
00:32:04,638 --> 00:32:07,090
I am in your mind

274
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,501
as you create me.

275
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:14,506
Oh, yes... I can feel my creation.

276
00:32:16,438 --> 00:32:20,054
I'm getting your message.
Are you getting mine?

277
00:32:21,961 --> 00:32:26,663
Oh, oh... We are excited, aren't we?

278
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:35,907
Now, we can have a
good time, can't we?

279
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,782
I'll tell you a secret, I find you
adorable.

280
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:49,123
I'll tell you a secret, I find you
adorable.

281
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:51,876
I find you adorable.

282
00:32:51,877 --> 00:32:54,035
I find you adorable.

283
00:32:56,043 --> 00:32:58,588
I don't need to ask how you find me.

284
00:32:58,589 --> 00:33:02,352
You see, I am your fantasy.

285
00:33:02,353 --> 00:33:06,703
I am your experience.
So experience me.

286
00:33:08,834 --> 00:33:12,074
I am your
pleasure. Enjoy me.

287
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:15,689
This is our moment together in time

288
00:33:16,724 --> 00:33:21,288
that we might turn this
moment into an eternity.

289
00:33:47,489 --> 00:33:52,075
<i>If we could only bend this minute.</i>

290
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:57,657
<i>Infinitely extend this minute.</i>

291
00:33:58,893 --> 00:34:05,003
<i>Then I could live my whole
life right now.</i>

292
00:34:11,492 --> 00:34:15,760
<i>Reality is sweet this minute.</i>

293
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:21,263
<i>Can't we repeat and repeat
this minute?</i>

294
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:29,189
<i>Why can't it always be right now?</i>

295
00:34:32,014 --> 00:34:35,707
<i>I've parted with yesterday.</i>

296
00:34:37,602 --> 00:34:42,751
<i>Yesterday's moment is cold.</i>

297
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:51,353
<i>All I ask is this moment to hold.</i>

298
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:03,900
<i>How can we ever lose this minute?</i>

299
00:35:05,507 --> 00:35:09,397
<i>From all my life, I choose this minute.</i>

300
00:35:11,141 --> 00:35:15,724
<i>I will give up the old and the new.</i>

301
00:35:16,368 --> 00:35:18,207
<i>Sharing with you...</i>

302
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,361
<i>this minute now.</i>

303
00:35:31,984 --> 00:35:38,984
<i>If I could just hold my breath and
close my eyes and not make a sound.</i>

304
00:35:46,129 --> 00:35:50,669
<i>Will the universe stop going 'round?</i>

305
00:35:57,901 --> 00:36:01,401
<i>Still the universe
keeps going'round and</i>

306
00:36:01,402 --> 00:36:04,901
<i>'round and on and on
and on and on and on.</i>

307
00:36:09,636 --> 00:36:12,371
<i>A minute's almost gone.</i>

308
00:36:12,914 --> 00:36:16,942
<i>How can we ever, ever lose
this minute?</i>

309
00:36:17,822 --> 00:36:22,963
<i>From all my life, I choose
this minute.</i>

310
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:31,430
<i>I will never need anything
more than living for this minute now.</i>

311
00:36:39,805 --> 00:36:42,000
<i>This minute now.</i>

312
00:36:45,417 --> 00:36:52,417
<i>This minute now.</i>

313
00:36:57,186 --> 00:37:02,963
<i>This minute... now.</i>

314
00:37:45,782 --> 00:37:49,570
Ah, I have made the connection.
You may speak now, if you wish.

315
00:37:50,416 --> 00:37:53,827
Malla, it's good to see you.
Happy Life Day

316
00:37:58,089 --> 00:37:59,986
Oh, she says it may be
a happy Life Day for

317
00:37:59,987 --> 00:38:01,883
you, but personally,
she's seen happier ones.

318
00:38:02,486 --> 00:38:04,207
I... I don't want to
tie up the channels.

319
00:38:04,208 --> 00:38:06,600
So, could you do me a
favor and send either

320
00:38:06,601 --> 00:38:08,991
Chewbacca or Han Solo
to the screen please?

321
00:38:11,944 --> 00:38:13,743
She says that she would
like to grant your

322
00:38:13,744 --> 00:38:15,541
request, but is quite unable to do so.

323
00:38:15,741 --> 00:38:16,813
You mean they haven't arrived yet?

324
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:22,583
She says, there has been no contact.

325
00:38:22,584 --> 00:38:24,545
Yes, I think I understand her message.

326
00:38:25,954 --> 00:38:29,243
Oh, that Imperial patrol must be giving
them more trouble than we bargained for.

327
00:38:31,946 --> 00:38:33,806
Malla, are, are you alone?

328
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,405
If, you would permit me.

329
00:38:38,352 --> 00:38:41,809
No, she says she is not alone.
She's with a friend.

330
00:38:42,836 --> 00:38:44,887
Could he come to the screen, please?

331
00:38:50,986 --> 00:38:52,561
Good afternoon, ma'am.

332
00:38:52,806 --> 00:38:55,142
I'm Saundan, a local trader.

333
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:58,295
A friend of the rebellion and a
member of the Alliance.

334
00:38:59,485 --> 00:39:02,014
Good. Look, I know I can
count on you to take

335
00:39:02,015 --> 00:39:04,543
care of my friends until
their leader returns.

336
00:39:04,544 --> 00:39:06,110
You'll do that for me, won't you?

337
00:39:06,327 --> 00:39:08,749
Yes indeed, ma'am.
That's what I'm here for.

338
00:39:11,335 --> 00:39:13,747
She is expressing her warmth
towards the trader.

339
00:39:15,217 --> 00:39:18,900
Look, I can see you're in good hands,
Malla. I'll contact you again, soon.

340
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,209
Now then,

341
00:39:25,944 --> 00:39:27,227
what's that I smell?

342
00:39:27,428 --> 00:39:30,193
Oh, could it be some of those
famous wookiee ookiees?

343
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,977
I told you we'd make it. Did I ever let
you down?

344
00:39:43,182 --> 00:39:46,391
I feel the same way about you too, pal.
And your family.

345
00:39:50,434 --> 00:39:53,228
I've never seen so much Imperial traffic
in this system.

346
00:39:53,263 --> 00:39:56,022
Better land on the north side. It'll be
safer there.

347
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:02,150
So, it's a long walk. A little exercise
never hurt anybody.

348
00:40:08,755 --> 00:40:10,498
Happy Life Day, pal.

349
00:40:25,228 --> 00:40:26,871
Sounds like a starship.

350
00:40:26,906 --> 00:40:29,531
What I tell ya?
Must be Chewbacca now!

351
00:45:23,103 --> 00:45:25,447
This unit is occupied by four wookiees.

352
00:45:25,448 --> 00:45:29,340
Two adult males, one adult female, and
one male child.

353
00:45:38,984 --> 00:45:41,128
Where is the other wookiee male?

354
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:46,075
Officer, uh, maybe I could
be of some help there, sir.

355
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:49,343
Who are you and what are you
doing in this wookiee house?

356
00:45:49,344 --> 00:45:51,422
Oh, I'm a trader in this district.
You see, the uh,

357
00:45:51,423 --> 00:45:53,435
uh the truth of the matter
is she had a terrible fight

358
00:45:53,436 --> 00:45:55,446
with her husband and he
just stormed right out.

359
00:45:55,447 --> 00:45:56,448
Your identification.

360
00:45:56,449 --> 00:45:57,449
I said it!

361
00:45:58,621 --> 00:45:59,986
Your identification.

362
00:45:59,987 --> 00:46:00,988
Oh, identification, yes.

363
00:46:00,989 --> 00:46:03,414
It's a very important
thing, identification.

364
00:46:03,415 --> 00:46:05,329
I, I never leave the shop
without my identification.

365
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:07,242
It's uh, it's very important,
just in times like this.

366
00:46:07,243 --> 00:46:09,305
I just found my identification. I think
it's in my pocket.

367
00:46:10,308 --> 00:46:11,346
Search the dwelling.

368
00:46:12,701 --> 00:46:14,469
Officer, you may notice
that little leather

369
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:16,236
case that I carry my
identification card in.

370
00:46:16,237 --> 00:46:19,954
I whipped that up myself. That's a
pretty fast selling little item.

371
00:46:24,957 --> 00:46:28,260
Uh... uh well, some people like to keep
things neat and clean and that's why uh,

372
00:46:28,261 --> 00:46:30,592
I have the little leather case for the
identification card.

373
00:46:30,593 --> 00:46:32,803
As a matter of fact, if any
of you guys want a couple of

374
00:46:32,804 --> 00:46:35,113
those leather cases. I've gotta
couple of extra ones here.

375
00:46:44,941 --> 00:46:47,084
Oh, officer, that uh, that
picture you're looking

376
00:46:47,085 --> 00:46:49,227
at right now was taken
quite a few years ago.

377
00:46:49,228 --> 00:46:52,398
That's uh, one of me. I've
gained quite a bit of weight since then.

378
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,374
Hello little guy.
Where's your daddy?

379
00:46:59,921 --> 00:47:03,110
Hey, they have no respect for authority!

380
00:47:04,449 --> 00:47:05,916
Excuse me. I beg your pardon.

381
00:47:05,917 --> 00:47:08,889
Uh, maybe you know my brother's boy.
He's a member of the Imperial militia.

382
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:12,141
He must be 24 or 25 years old by know.
Good little guy...

383
00:47:12,142 --> 00:47:15,004
Your identification is in order.
You can go now.

384
00:47:15,005 --> 00:47:16,418
Thank you, thank you very much.

385
00:47:16,419 --> 00:47:19,203
I just have a little more work to
finish up here and uh,

386
00:47:19,204 --> 00:47:21,341
oh by the way, uh,
while I'm finishing up

387
00:47:21,342 --> 00:47:23,477
here uh, why don't you
boys uh, take it easy.

388
00:47:23,478 --> 00:47:25,724
Relax. Put your feet up
and make yourself at home.

389
00:47:25,725 --> 00:47:28,024
Wookiee food isn't the
greatest but I'm sure I can

390
00:47:28,025 --> 00:47:30,323
whip something up in the
kitchen that we can all eat.

391
00:47:30,923 --> 00:47:32,287
Uh, you don't mind do ya, Malla?

392
00:47:33,859 --> 00:47:35,775
Malla will you come in the kitchen to
help me.

393
00:47:43,763 --> 00:47:46,880
What are doing with that thing? That's a
very delicate piece of workmanship.

394
00:47:46,881 --> 00:47:48,078
Alright Malla, it's alright.

395
00:47:48,379 --> 00:47:50,572
The slightest jarring will mess up the
whole works.

396
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:53,346
If you're going to play
around with it let me show you how.

397
00:47:55,066 --> 00:47:57,291
Relax, I gotta turn it on, don't I?

398
00:47:58,923 --> 00:48:00,990
Just sit down and enjoy it.

399
00:48:03,809 --> 00:48:06,071
Ok. Here we go.

400
00:48:33,716 --> 00:48:35,296
Will you get on with it?

401
00:48:35,297 --> 00:48:36,297
Okay, okay.

402
00:49:11,689 --> 00:49:15,568
<i>God, all dignified, if you want to.</i>

403
00:49:17,546 --> 00:49:21,682
<i>What I would really like to know.</i>

404
00:49:23,504 --> 00:49:26,840
<i>Will you light the sky on fire?</i>

405
00:49:29,439 --> 00:49:33,339
<i>Will you light
tonight like you did the night before?</i>

406
00:49:34,525 --> 00:49:39,445
<i>Hey! You could take me higher than the
diamonds in the sky.</i>

407
00:49:41,369 --> 00:49:44,544
<i>Take me, light in the
sky and we'll vanish</i>

408
00:49:44,545 --> 00:49:47,719
<i>without a trace and
we'll see God then.</i>

409
00:49:59,415 --> 00:50:02,721
<i>Temples and mirrors interest me.</i>

410
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:08,741
<i>Though all there really is to know.</i>

411
00:50:11,549 --> 00:50:14,822
<i>Will you light the sky on fire?</i>

412
00:50:17,377 --> 00:50:21,996
<i>Will you light the sky on fire
again tonight?</i>

413
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:28,152
<i>You can take me higher
than the diamonds in the sky.</i>

414
00:50:30,473 --> 00:50:36,155
<i>Take me, we'll vanish without a
trace and then we'll all see God then.</i>

415
00:50:59,902 --> 00:51:02,126
<i>On the pyramids of the legend.</i>

416
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:06,620
<i>The great god Kopa Khan came
from the stars and vanished.</i>

417
00:51:06,843 --> 00:51:10,567
<i>And the legends say he will
come back again someday</i>

418
00:51:13,326 --> 00:51:14,522
<i>someday...</i>

419
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:56,449
<i>Will you light the sky on fire?</i>

420
00:51:59,714 --> 00:52:03,719
<i>Will you light tonight like
you did the night before.</i>

421
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:09,874
<i>You can take me
higher than the diamonds in the sky.</i>

422
00:52:11,501 --> 00:52:15,936
<i>Take me, light in the sky and we'll
vanish without a trace,</i>

423
00:52:15,937 --> 00:52:18,217
<i>And then we'll see god then.</i>

424
00:52:23,502 --> 00:52:27,009
<i>Yes, I would really like to know.</i>

425
00:52:29,975 --> 00:52:33,759
<i>What I've been watching this for.</i>

426
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:39,842
<i>Yes, I would really like to know.</i>

427
00:52:42,138 --> 00:52:45,053
<i>Will you light the sky on fire?</i>

428
00:52:48,087 --> 00:52:52,354
<i>Will you light the sky
like you did the night before?</i>

429
00:52:54,038 --> 00:52:58,175
<i>You could take me higher than
the diamonds in the sky.</i>

430
00:53:00,807 --> 00:53:05,737
<i>Take me, we'll vanish without a
trace. And we'll all see God then.</i>

431
00:53:08,667 --> 00:53:10,766
<i>Vanish without a trace.</i>

432
00:53:14,541 --> 00:53:16,531
<i>Vanish without a trace.</i>

433
00:53:17,681 --> 00:53:22,165
<i>Come on, come on, come on, come on,
come on, let's vanish without a trace.</i>

434
00:53:23,353 --> 00:53:27,899
<i>Come on, come on, come on, come on,
come on, we'll vanish without a trace.</i>

435
00:54:04,894 --> 00:54:05,945
I knew you'd like it.

436
00:54:06,345 --> 00:54:10,391
Your work here is finished.
You may leave now.

437
00:54:10,392 --> 00:54:12,804
I guess you're right. It's about all

438
00:54:13,845 --> 00:54:16,370
I can do for now. I hope you guys
find what you're looking for.

439
00:54:16,857 --> 00:54:18,069
Keep up the good work.

440
00:54:18,558 --> 00:54:19,427
Malla.

441
00:54:21,307 --> 00:54:23,387
Itchy, please...

442
00:54:26,929 --> 00:54:29,967
Alright, finish the search of the
residence.

443
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,122
Oh, I almost forgot.
I want to leave you

444
00:54:32,123 --> 00:54:33,763
my card in case you
need any of uh, oh...

445
00:54:33,764 --> 00:54:34,845
Okay, I'm leaving.

446
00:54:37,806 --> 00:54:40,915
Investigate the upper area. Check for
any Rebel material.

447
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:44,592
Anything to connect
this household with the Alliance.

448
00:54:44,593 --> 00:54:46,424
Oh, don't forget about
those protective cases for

449
00:54:46,425 --> 00:54:48,254
your identification card.
I gotta good item...

450
00:54:48,255 --> 00:54:49,255
That's it, I'm gone.

451
00:54:51,514 --> 00:54:55,248
Finish the search of the house. We have
other areas to cover today.

452
00:54:56,624 --> 00:54:59,491
You! Take the upper area.

453
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:07,058
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uhh...

454
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:10,403
We don't want to have to hurt anyone.

455
00:55:11,188 --> 00:55:14,356
That's not what we're here for.

456
00:55:15,169 --> 00:55:21,438
But, when my men get angry I can't
always control them.

457
00:55:22,756 --> 00:55:25,792
We are going to continue our search.

458
00:55:28,176 --> 00:55:30,954
Now keep him quiet

459
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:35,310
and I'll forget this ever happened.

460
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,917
Starlog 3-24-1 from the
bridge of the cruiser

461
00:56:10,918 --> 00:56:13,514
RS Reekvange, captain Kazan reporting.

462
00:56:13,515 --> 00:56:17,058
We are awaiting the return of captain
Han Solo and his first mate, Chewbacca.

463
00:56:17,059 --> 00:56:19,084
Who are long overdue
on a delicate mission

464
00:56:19,085 --> 00:56:21,109
to acquire the mystical talisman,

465
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:24,342
which has been sought by our
forces and the Empire.

466
00:56:26,736 --> 00:56:29,984
The talisman, it makes things invisible,
I think.

467
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:31,696
Yes, even you.

468
00:56:32,446 --> 00:56:34,287
Which I think might be an
improvement.

469
00:56:34,828 --> 00:56:36,009
We've picked up something.

470
00:56:38,088 --> 00:56:39,433
It's the Millennium Falcon.

471
00:56:40,274 --> 00:56:42,777
They're coming out of lightspeed.
I can't make contact.

472
00:56:42,778 --> 00:56:43,966
Try a lower channel.

473
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:46,689
Falcon, do you copy? Come in Falcon.

474
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:49,188
It's Chewie. But where's Han?

475
00:56:49,189 --> 00:56:51,249
That's him! Hanging upside down!

476
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,623
I can't make radio contact.

477
00:56:54,024 --> 00:56:56,362
He's on a collision course.
Princess, we're

478
00:56:56,363 --> 00:56:58,699
in mortal danger from our own forces.

479
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,116
Falcon, do you copy?

480
00:57:00,117 --> 00:57:01,118
This is madness.

481
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:03,662
You're right General. I can't understand
what Chewbacca's doing.

482
00:57:04,077 --> 00:57:06,461
Whatever he's doing, there must be a
reason.

483
00:57:06,462 --> 00:57:07,263
Hold your fire.

484
00:57:07,264 --> 00:57:09,339
We've lost all contact, sir.

485
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:13,792
Standby. The Falcon is near impact.

486
00:57:18,933 --> 00:57:20,173
I'm going after them.

487
00:57:20,174 --> 00:57:22,258
Luke, take Artoo with you.

488
00:57:24,375 --> 00:57:25,463
What'd he say?

489
00:57:25,464 --> 00:57:28,605
If something has happened to captain
Solo and Chewbacca is alone,

490
00:57:28,905 --> 00:57:30,904
you will need me to interpret.

491
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,701
Sir, he's firing on us.

492
00:57:44,817 --> 00:57:47,122
I know, but I don't think
he means to hit us.

493
00:57:47,123 --> 00:57:49,427
Chewie's a better shot than that.

494
00:57:49,428 --> 00:57:51,387
Look, he's speeding up.
We're losing him.

495
00:57:52,061 --> 00:57:53,600
Not for long.

496
00:57:54,603 --> 00:57:57,775
This is Y-4 to base. He's heading
straight for a moon in...

497
00:57:58,276 --> 00:57:59,848
the Panos system.

498
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:11,009
Hang on Artoo.

499
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:13,756
What about me?
I'm going to shake apart!

500
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:15,912
We're approaching the water planet.

501
00:58:16,834 --> 00:58:18,571
We're following Han and Chewie...

502
00:58:21,151 --> 00:58:22,101
We've lost them.

503
00:58:23,251 --> 00:58:25,573
Hang on, Threepio. We're going in.

504
00:58:25,574 --> 00:58:27,742
Are you sure this is the best way, sir?

505
00:58:36,478 --> 00:58:38,542
Master Luke, sir, are you all right?

506
00:58:39,121 --> 00:58:40,839
Yes. How 'bout Artoo?

507
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:45,343
Our comlinks are out. We
can't contact the base.

508
00:58:47,647 --> 00:58:48,948
Where are you going, sir?

509
00:58:49,147 --> 00:58:51,851
To see if I can locate the Falcon by
visual sighting.

510
00:58:51,852 --> 00:58:53,585
Maybe it's close by.

511
00:58:58,303 --> 00:59:00,713
Artoo, stand by to
fire the ejection pod.

512
00:59:00,782 --> 00:59:03,063
And hurry Artoo or we'll be desert soon.

513
00:59:19,043 --> 00:59:20,456
What is it, master Luke?

514
00:59:20,908 --> 00:59:21,906
I'm not sure.

515
00:59:25,184 --> 00:59:27,177
You saved my life. Thank you.

516
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:28,765
You are alone?

517
00:59:29,554 --> 00:59:32,766
I have two droids. We've come in search
of a ship that crashed near here.

518
00:59:32,801 --> 00:59:34,268
Maybe I can help you.

519
00:59:34,303 --> 00:59:38,222
I am Boba Fett. The
ship you seek is nearby.

520
00:59:38,257 --> 00:59:40,322
Are the Imperial troops
near this planet?

521
00:59:40,357 --> 00:59:43,743
They are here, friend and growing more
powerful.

522
00:59:44,433 --> 00:59:45,578
How far away?

523
00:59:45,579 --> 00:59:49,594
Settle down.
All they do is eat.

524
00:59:49,629 --> 00:59:52,475
This is all we have but uh, he's welcome
to it.

525
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:56,087
You are foolish to waste your
kindness on this dumb creature.

526
00:59:56,088 --> 00:59:59,607
No lower life form is
worth going hungry for, friend.

527
01:00:00,434 --> 01:00:03,132
I take it
you have no love of the Empire.

528
01:00:03,594 --> 01:00:04,608
I don't.

529
01:00:05,336 --> 01:00:06,599
Well, neither do I.

530
01:00:06,934 --> 01:00:09,160
It will be easy to
find the ship you seek.

531
01:00:09,628 --> 01:00:11,087
Follow me, friend.

532
01:00:12,146 --> 01:00:15,119
Don't you think it might be imprudent to
trust him so quickly, sir?

533
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:19,753
He's our only chance. And, besides he
seems like a friend.

534
01:00:22,416 --> 01:00:26,185
Indeed, friend is merely a term that is
often misused.

535
01:00:26,486 --> 01:00:27,866
Did Artoo say that?

536
01:00:27,901 --> 01:00:29,583
Words to that affect.

537
01:00:37,857 --> 01:00:41,681
Chewie, you've got the talisman.
What's wrong?

538
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,318
No, don't destroy it!

539
01:00:47,862 --> 01:00:48,884
The talisman...

540
01:00:48,885 --> 01:00:51,174
Boba Fett, no! He's a friend.

541
01:00:51,774 --> 01:00:54,390
Don't hurt him, Boba Fett.

542
01:00:54,791 --> 01:00:56,345
What did he do to Luke?

543
01:00:58,468 --> 01:01:02,324
He didn't do anything. R2-D2
has detected contamination.

544
01:01:03,274 --> 01:01:04,796
It must have come from the talisman.

545
01:01:05,938 --> 01:01:10,101
Artoo says it's some kind of sleeping
virus that only affects humans.

546
01:01:11,886 --> 01:01:15,627
He says the only way to keep them alive
is to let the blood rush to their heads.

547
01:01:16,311 --> 01:01:19,377
I know this sleeping virus the Empire
uses on its enemies.

548
01:01:19,678 --> 01:01:23,414
They have a remedy for it in the city.
I could get some for you.

549
01:01:24,624 --> 01:01:27,972
I'm afraid, Chewbacca
insists on going with you

550
01:01:27,973 --> 01:01:32,389
You'll only get in the way. But, if you
must. Come on.

551
01:01:57,721 --> 01:01:58,721
You stay here.

552
01:02:00,293 --> 01:02:01,947
While I get the serum.

553
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:05,706
I said stay, friend.

554
01:02:06,007 --> 01:02:10,703
Luke trusted me and I'm your only
chance of getting out of here alive.

555
01:02:10,704 --> 01:02:13,141
Do you understand me?

556
01:02:21,759 --> 01:02:24,307
Starlog update: although
Boba Fett quickly

557
01:02:24,308 --> 01:02:26,854
located the serum for
the sleeping virus

558
01:02:26,855 --> 01:02:29,337
We had no idea of his real plan.

559
01:02:38,998 --> 01:02:41,323
I have made contact
with the Rebels and all

560
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:43,647
is proceeding as you
wish, Darth Vader.

561
01:02:47,429 --> 01:02:49,138
What is it now?

562
01:07:43,306 --> 01:07:45,957
Oh is that all, just some silly game.

563
01:08:03,754 --> 01:08:06,204
Yes, their metabolisms are slowing down.

564
01:08:06,205 --> 01:08:08,158
I wonder what's keeping Chewbacca.

565
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:11,421
Try to find them on the viewscreen.
Darth Vader!

566
01:08:11,422 --> 01:08:16,174
Good work, but I want them alive.

567
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:21,387
Now that you've got their trust,
they may take you to their new base.

568
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:22,935
This time we'll get them all.

569
01:08:22,936 --> 01:08:28,953
I see why they call you the best bounty
hunter in the galaxy.

570
01:08:29,054 --> 01:08:31,094
Oh no! What will we do now?

571
01:08:36,141 --> 01:08:37,654
I have the serum.

572
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:39,588
We must leave quickly, friend.

573
01:09:06,472 --> 01:09:07,724
Are you all right?

574
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:08,770
I'm not sure.

575
01:09:10,405 --> 01:09:11,552
What happened?

576
01:09:11,553 --> 01:09:12,788
I don't know.

577
01:09:12,789 --> 01:09:15,181
Well, somebody must know something.

578
01:09:18,494 --> 01:09:21,639
He says our friend Boba found serum for
the talisman virus.

579
01:09:23,134 --> 01:09:24,995
Boba, you're a hero and
a faithful friend.

580
01:09:24,996 --> 01:09:26,856
You must come back with us.

581
01:09:28,864 --> 01:09:30,368
What's the matter with Artoo?

582
01:09:30,369 --> 01:09:35,602
I'm afraid, sir, it's because you said
Boba is a friend and faithful ally.

583
01:09:35,603 --> 01:09:38,798
That simply does not feed properly into
Artoo's information bank.

584
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,445
What are you talking about?

585
01:09:40,446 --> 01:09:43,327
We intercepted a message between
Boba and Darth Vader, sir.

586
01:09:43,328 --> 01:09:46,533
Boba Fett is Darth Vader's
right hand man. I'm afraid

587
01:09:46,534 --> 01:09:49,738
this whole adventure has
been an Imperial plot.

588
01:09:49,739 --> 01:09:51,593
We'll meet again, friend.

589
01:09:55,282 --> 01:09:58,344
Well, trust a droid to get to the bottom
of things.

590
01:09:58,345 --> 01:10:00,576
Boba sure fooled the rest of us.

591
01:10:01,851 --> 01:10:03,106
I beg your pardon, sir.

592
01:10:03,541 --> 01:10:07,119
Chewbacca suspected all along there
was something bad about Boba.

593
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,576
How did you know, Chewie?

594
01:10:10,481 --> 01:10:13,783
May I quote directly, sir?
He just didn't smell right.

595
01:10:17,183 --> 01:10:19,914
Well, lets's get off this galactic
raindrop.

596
01:10:20,677 --> 01:10:23,628
Captain Kazan, starlog
3-24-1 signing off.

597
01:10:23,629 --> 01:10:26,579
May the force be with you.

598
01:11:16,563 --> 01:11:17,625
Let's go.

599
01:11:35,643 --> 01:11:36,947
Nothing up there.

600
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:45,361
Go clean up your room.

601
01:12:16,552 --> 01:12:19,228
That will keep him busy for a while.

602
01:13:28,015 --> 01:13:32,146
This product was packed under strict
quality control on the system Amorphia

603
01:13:32,147 --> 01:13:35,192
and this instructional cassette provided
by the manufacturer.

604
01:13:35,193 --> 01:13:40,237
It offers a unique chance for consumers
everywhere to meet an Amorphian being.

605
01:13:40,238 --> 01:13:42,814
The motor abilities
of Amorphian citizens

606
01:13:42,815 --> 01:13:45,390
are frequently impaired
by malfunctions

607
01:13:45,391 --> 01:13:48,134
which results in
a temporary loss of power.

608
01:13:49,542 --> 01:13:53,069
This in no way reflects on the
safety of our product,

609
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:55,973
rather it should serve
as a guarantee of our

610
01:13:55,974 --> 01:13:58,876
high standards of long
wear and durability.

611
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:04,225
Thank you for selecting our brand of
mini-transmitter.

612
01:14:04,803 --> 01:14:08,734
If you assemble it properly, following
the instructions I'm about to give you.

613
01:14:08,935 --> 01:14:13,254
It will provide many years of fun
and valuable services.

614
01:14:22,758 --> 01:14:24,555
But, now let's get started, shall we?

615
01:14:32,056 --> 01:14:36,564
First, find the sealed package
containing all the tools you'll need.

616
01:14:42,438 --> 01:14:43,534
It looks like this.

617
01:14:46,428 --> 01:14:49,814
Try not to rip it open because
it makes a very handy

618
01:14:49,815 --> 01:14:53,199
storage case for your tools
until you need them again.

619
01:14:59,904 --> 01:15:02,945
Now, this is the first
thing you'll need.

620
01:15:04,367 --> 01:15:07,951
Please be careful not to hurt
yourself on the sharp edges.

621
01:15:21,871 --> 01:15:26,097
Now, find the circuit breaker module

622
01:15:27,033 --> 01:15:30,408
and by the way, let's start calling
these components by their proper names.

623
01:15:30,999 --> 01:15:34,595
Circuit breaker module.

624
01:15:48,979 --> 01:15:52,479
Remember, every one of the ten
thousand terminals on your

625
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:55,979
circuit breaker module is
marked in a particular color.

626
01:15:57,322 --> 01:15:59,847
Beautiful, aren't they? Like a rainbow.

627
01:16:00,829 --> 01:16:04,160
These must be connected with the
wires with the corresponding colors.

628
01:16:05,092 --> 01:16:07,697
So, red goes to red.

629
01:16:10,501 --> 01:16:16,062
Blue goes to blue and so on.
Now, watch me closely.

630
01:16:19,099 --> 01:16:21,211
And we'll assemble our mini-transmitters
together.

631
01:16:22,053 --> 01:16:27,685
Let us work slowly and methodically
because this is a job worth doing well.

632
01:16:29,047 --> 01:16:30,892
Well, I see time is running out.

633
01:16:31,309 --> 01:16:32,852
So, we better turn
our attention to the

634
01:16:32,853 --> 01:16:34,594
assembly of the impulse
to voice translator.

635
01:16:35,033 --> 01:16:37,014
The impulse to voice translator.

636
01:16:37,249 --> 01:16:39,549
The very heart of the
mini-transmitter which

637
01:16:39,550 --> 01:16:41,848
converts electronic
energy which provide

638
01:16:41,849 --> 01:16:45,220
into any of a thousand
recognizable languages.

639
01:16:45,255 --> 01:16:50,435
We must remain alert for this very
complicated procedure.

640
01:16:51,472 --> 01:16:55,254
Endurance and concentration are the key
words here

641
01:16:55,729 --> 01:16:59,229
and the total utilization
of our neural

642
01:16:59,230 --> 01:17:02,729
cranial synapsis is
absolutely essential.

643
01:19:43,559 --> 01:19:45,659
The following live broadcast is...

644
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:48,971
recommended by the Imperial
council in the belief that your

645
01:19:48,972 --> 01:19:52,282
commitment to remain upstanding
citizens will be reinforced.

646
01:19:52,283 --> 01:19:55,930
It is required viewing for all
members of the Imperial forces.

647
01:19:55,931 --> 01:19:58,538
Time now for life on Tatooine.

648
01:19:58,954 --> 01:20:01,927
Brought to viewers
everywhere in the hope that

649
01:20:01,928 --> 01:20:04,900
our own lives may be
uplifted by the comparison

650
01:20:04,901 --> 01:20:07,700
and enriched with the
gratitude of relief.

651
01:20:08,298 --> 01:20:10,726
This transmission isunrehearsed and
unedited

652
01:20:10,727 --> 01:20:15,615
and is hereby begun without further
comment as to its lack of moral value.

653
01:21:09,970 --> 01:21:13,447
Well, I'm certainly not going to
get rich with customers like you.

654
01:21:13,448 --> 01:21:15,713
I thought I taught you to
drink faster than that.

655
01:21:15,714 --> 01:21:17,605
Well, at least you're steady.

656
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:21,123
Oh, come on now. Drink up. There's
plenty more where that came from.

657
01:21:26,361 --> 01:21:29,033
- What'll it be?
- Hello, Ackmena.

658
01:21:29,434 --> 01:21:33,446
Okay, we'll do it your way. Hello. Now,
we'll do it my way. What'll it be?

659
01:21:33,447 --> 01:21:34,629
Can we talk?

660
01:21:35,179 --> 01:21:36,650
Well of course we can talk.

661
01:21:36,651 --> 01:21:39,505
We are talking. You're not ordering.
I'm not pouring.

662
01:21:39,506 --> 01:21:42,359
We are not drinking. We are talking.

663
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:45,837
I'm moving this to make room for
a drink, so that next time I

664
01:21:45,838 --> 01:21:49,314
say "what'll it be" and you tell me.
I can put it right there.

665
01:21:49,349 --> 01:21:50,694
Doesn't matter. Give me anything.

666
01:21:50,695 --> 01:21:52,189
I'll have one of those.

667
01:21:53,276 --> 01:21:55,098
I'm sorry I couldn't get back before.

668
01:21:55,099 --> 01:21:56,339
Ah, before what?

669
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:57,535
Uh, until now...

670
01:21:57,835 --> 01:21:59,752
until tonight. I thought
about it a dozen times.

671
01:21:59,753 --> 01:22:00,869
I had to be sure.

672
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:02,541
Ah, excuse me. I have
a customer waiting.

673
01:22:02,542 --> 01:22:03,612
I'll be right back.

674
01:22:04,633 --> 01:22:07,511
"Come back soon, I'll be waiting."

675
01:22:20,332 --> 01:22:21,281
Ackmena?

676
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:30,287
How's your drink?

677
01:22:30,862 --> 01:22:33,977
It's all gone. Look, there's
a flower on top of it.

678
01:22:34,048 --> 01:22:35,884
I see there is. Do you
want another drink?

679
01:22:36,566 --> 01:22:38,714
The flower is for you.
I wanted to bring you

680
01:22:38,715 --> 01:22:40,861
something and that's
all I could think of.

681
01:22:41,994 --> 01:22:44,779
I don't get many flowers.
I uh... but you

682
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:47,564
didn't have to bring
me anything Ah, ah...

683
01:22:47,634 --> 01:22:48,922
Krelman.

684
01:22:49,645 --> 01:22:51,967
Krelman, what a nice name.

685
01:22:53,112 --> 01:22:55,524
When I left here the other
night, I felt something

686
01:22:55,525 --> 01:22:57,936
that I haven't felt in longer
than I care to remember.

687
01:22:58,346 --> 01:22:59,707
I felt alive again.

688
01:23:00,303 --> 01:23:03,539
Someone made me feel like all the
years I've lived meant something.

689
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:08,198
And all you said was six simple words.
"Come back soon, I'll be waiting."

690
01:23:08,199 --> 01:23:10,796
Well, after all, only
words I probably...

691
01:23:10,797 --> 01:23:13,234
more than words. I knew that
at the time.

692
01:23:13,599 --> 01:23:16,895
That's why I went home and thought
and thought about what you said.

693
01:23:16,896 --> 01:23:18,444
Oh? What did I say?

694
01:23:18,445 --> 01:23:20,773
It uh, it doesn't matter, silly.

695
01:23:20,774 --> 01:23:23,466
What you said is not as important
as what you meant.

696
01:23:23,467 --> 01:23:24,468
Oh? What did I mean?

697
01:23:24,469 --> 01:23:28,425
I decided what you meant was exactly the
thing I needed to hear.

698
01:23:28,726 --> 01:23:30,580
Well, I'm glad about that.

699
01:23:31,303 --> 01:23:34,299
You know its funny. A man can live as
long as I have.

700
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:37,140
Through all the ups and
downs and just when he

701
01:23:37,141 --> 01:23:39,980
thinks its all over, someone
cares for him again.

702
01:23:39,981 --> 01:23:42,262
I wasn't looking for that when I came in
here.

703
01:23:42,263 --> 01:23:43,926
Maybe that's why it, it happened.
Because

704
01:23:43,927 --> 01:23:45,588
I wasn't asking for love anymore.

705
01:23:45,589 --> 01:23:47,857
I wasn't desperate. I wasn't
begging, whining, ruffling,

706
01:23:47,858 --> 01:23:50,125
sniveling. I just came
in here for a drink...

707
01:23:51,288 --> 01:23:52,663
and I find a lot more.

708
01:23:52,964 --> 01:23:56,497
- Uh, uh, Kerlman...
- Krelman.

709
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:59,636
Uh, lis... listen uh, Krelman.
You're, you're kind

710
01:23:59,637 --> 01:24:02,739
and, and sweet and, and
terribly attractive but,

711
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:05,840
if, if you're saying what
I think you're saying you

712
01:24:05,841 --> 01:24:08,940
felt you meant I thought
you needed to hear then,

713
01:24:08,941 --> 01:24:10,896
I just have one thing to say. I did not.

714
01:24:11,256 --> 01:24:12,991
Ackmena, don't do this to me...

715
01:24:12,992 --> 01:24:14,585
Now, please look! I have customers.

716
01:24:14,586 --> 01:24:16,918
Why don't you sit down.
Finish your drink.

717
01:24:16,919 --> 01:24:19,250
Have another drink. This one's on me.

718
01:24:20,474 --> 01:24:24,192
Now, you stay just as long as you want.

719
01:24:34,982 --> 01:24:38,254
But, I have business to attend to. I
really have no time for anything else.

720
01:24:38,255 --> 01:24:40,859
You'll change your mind.
I just know you will.

721
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:42,497
Six simple words.

722
01:24:42,498 --> 01:24:45,674
I could wait forever to hear it
again because I know...

723
01:24:45,675 --> 01:24:47,822
Come back soon, I'll be waiting.

724
01:25:11,038 --> 01:25:14,398
Due to increased activity among
subversive forces,

725
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:19,424
we are placing a curfew on the entire
Tatooine system effective immediately.

726
01:25:19,625 --> 01:25:24,163
All inhabitants will return to their
homes at once.

727
01:25:24,972 --> 01:25:28,238
This order will remain in
effect until further notice.

728
01:25:39,611 --> 01:25:41,308
Okay, Bobbarine. Take a break.

729
01:25:42,626 --> 01:25:45,302
I don't know how long. Maybe forever.

730
01:25:45,576 --> 01:25:46,694
Oh, don't leave me now.

731
01:25:48,056 --> 01:25:50,440
Please, please, I have
enough aggravation.

732
01:25:51,639 --> 01:25:53,692
Alright, one more round
before you leave.

733
01:25:53,693 --> 01:25:55,744
And this one's on the me. Tork,

734
01:25:57,714 --> 01:25:59,613
see what the boys on the bandstand
will have.

735
01:26:06,801 --> 01:26:11,079
Gentlemen, gentlemen, I don't
know how to tell you this but

736
01:26:11,470 --> 01:26:15,864
I guess the wall screen
said it all. We're closed.

737
01:26:19,329 --> 01:26:21,592
Gentlemen, I guess you
didn't hear what I said.

738
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:25,066
The Empire has closed us down.

739
01:26:25,801 --> 01:26:28,038
Now, I know this sort of
thing happens all the time.

740
01:26:28,039 --> 01:26:30,274
I... I'm sure it's just temporary,

741
01:26:30,702 --> 01:26:32,585
Fellas, The party is over.

742
01:26:34,789 --> 01:26:36,242
How dare you. You stop that.

743
01:26:36,411 --> 01:26:39,935
Stop Tork, it's alright.
I'll reason with them.

744
01:26:43,063 --> 01:26:48,717
Kelnor, Zutnor, come on you guys.
Haven't I always lent you money?

745
01:26:51,396 --> 01:26:55,028
Ludlow, Ludlow, you of all creatures.
Please do me a favor and leave.

746
01:26:56,364 --> 01:26:57,624
Ludlow, you're heartless.

747
01:26:58,744 --> 01:27:01,104
Thorp, Thorp, after all
I've down for you.

748
01:27:03,652 --> 01:27:05,078
Short memory, eh, Thorp?

749
01:27:05,079 --> 01:27:06,579
Short memory!

750
01:27:07,498 --> 01:27:09,798
Helpmus, do you remember
the time that...

751
01:27:11,162 --> 01:27:12,772
I don't believe we've met.

752
01:27:14,434 --> 01:27:15,404
We're closed!

753
01:27:16,729 --> 01:27:17,972
I said, we're closed.

754
01:27:18,464 --> 01:27:20,410
Look, I'm sorry we are closed.

755
01:27:20,818 --> 01:27:22,874
The Empire just imposed a
curfew on this planet.

756
01:27:22,875 --> 01:27:24,929
Everybody has to leave right now.

757
01:27:26,288 --> 01:27:29,114
Now... Tork, I don't
want anymore trouble.

758
01:27:29,115 --> 01:27:31,940
You, take care of the door.

759
01:27:47,303 --> 01:27:51,874
Alright, alright, alright, alright.

760
01:27:53,072 --> 01:27:54,223
I can take a hint.

761
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:56,926
We'll have one more round.

762
01:27:57,223 --> 01:27:58,772
This one's on the house.

763
01:28:01,902 --> 01:28:03,581
I'll run a tab for the Empire.

764
01:28:20,576 --> 01:28:22,110
<i>Just one more round, friend.</i>

765
01:28:23,370 --> 01:28:25,344
<i>Then homeward bound, friend.</i>

766
01:28:26,659 --> 01:28:28,754
<i>Don't forget me in your dreams.</i>

767
01:28:32,058 --> 01:28:34,063
<i>Just one more song, friend.</i>

768
01:28:35,125 --> 01:28:36,498
<i>I so lone friend</i>

769
01:28:37,985 --> 01:28:40,963
<i>The night's get shorter it seems.</i>

770
01:28:43,650 --> 01:28:46,745
<i>Just one more rhyme, friend.</i>

771
01:28:46,746 --> 01:28:48,544
<i>Yes, it's a crime, friend.</i>

772
01:28:49,605 --> 01:28:54,984
<i>But you know time, friend.
Time can fly.</i>

773
01:28:55,832 --> 01:28:57,389
<i>So it's goodnight, friend.</i>

774
01:29:00,603 --> 01:29:03,012
<i>Goodnight, but not goodbye.</i>

775
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:18,007
<i>Just one more drop, friend.</i>

776
01:29:19,552 --> 01:29:21,272
<i>Before we stop, friend.</i>

777
01:29:22,859 --> 01:29:25,069
<i>One more moment face to face.</i>

778
01:29:28,203 --> 01:29:30,161
<i>Next time you're dry, friend.</i>

779
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:36,999
<i>Try stopping by, friend.
If there's a light in the place.</i>

780
01:29:40,009 --> 01:29:42,588
<i>We may not cry, friend.</i>

781
01:29:43,452 --> 01:29:45,043
<i>But we survive, friend.</i>

782
01:29:46,145 --> 01:29:50,922
<i>Look, we're alive, friend.
You and I.</i>

783
01:29:52,059 --> 01:29:53,429
<i>So say goodnight, friend.</i>

784
01:29:57,311 --> 01:29:59,198
<i>Goodnight, but not goodbye.</i>

785
01:30:09,286 --> 01:30:16,286
<i>Just one more dance, friend.
Just one more chance, friend.</i>

786
01:30:17,689 --> 01:30:20,329
<i>One more chorus, one more tune.</i>

787
01:30:23,716 --> 01:30:25,916
<i>It's not the end, friend.</i>

788
01:30:26,816 --> 01:30:29,020
<i>If you're a friend, friend.</i>

789
01:30:29,842 --> 01:30:32,412
<i>Then you come back to me soon.</i>

790
01:30:35,683 --> 01:30:37,425
<i>But it's too late, pal.</i>

791
01:30:38,808 --> 01:30:40,701
<i>To celebrate, pal.</i>

792
01:30:42,038 --> 01:30:44,184
<i>You have to wait, pal.</i>

793
01:30:45,071 --> 01:30:47,384
<i>Don't you cry.</i>

794
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:49,821
<i>Now, it's goodnight, friend.</i>

795
01:30:52,004 --> 01:30:53,059
<i>Goodnight friend.</i>

796
01:30:55,219 --> 01:30:55,980
<i>Goodnight friend.</i>

797
01:31:13,643 --> 01:31:14,478
<i>Follow me!</i>

798
01:31:54,105 --> 01:31:55,567
<i>You're such a dear, friend.</i>

799
01:32:01,693 --> 01:32:03,092
<i>You know I'm here, friend.</i>

800
01:32:06,568 --> 01:32:08,075
<i>Is that a tear, friend.</i>

801
01:32:10,096 --> 01:32:10,889
<i>In your eye?</i>

802
01:32:14,850 --> 01:32:16,074
<i>Now, it's goodnight, friend.</i>

803
01:32:21,813 --> 01:32:23,313
<i>Goodnight friend.</i>

804
01:32:30,921 --> 01:32:34,090
<i>Goodnight but not...</i>

805
01:33:03,464 --> 01:33:09,763
Return to base. Return to base.
Return to base. Return to base...

806
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,192
Message received and obeyed.

807
01:33:15,116 --> 01:33:16,443
We leave at once.

808
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:21,372
You, stay here.

809
01:33:22,008 --> 01:33:24,336
There's a male missing
from this household

810
01:33:24,337 --> 01:33:26,664
and I want you to be
here when he returns.

811
01:33:27,325 --> 01:33:30,491
It's possible, he's one of the
Rebels we're looking for.

812
01:33:46,215 --> 01:33:52,534
Return to base. Return to base.
Return to base. Return to base...

813
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:08,850
Return to base. Return to base.
Return to base. Return to base...

814
01:38:40,374 --> 01:38:42,653
Lumpy, are there any more inside?

815
01:38:43,498 --> 01:38:45,796
Come here sweetheart.
It's okay. It's alright now.

816
01:38:46,614 --> 01:38:48,296
Everything's okay now.
Here's your daddy.

817
01:38:48,874 --> 01:38:50,413
Boy, has he grown.

818
01:38:53,281 --> 01:38:55,386
It's okay everybody. He's gone.

819
01:38:55,387 --> 01:38:58,000
How are ya? Malla! Ha, ha!

820
01:39:00,003 --> 01:39:01,655
Itchy, you look wonderful.

821
01:39:01,656 --> 01:39:02,486
Doing well, huh?

822
01:39:02,941 --> 01:39:07,647
Your son's been doin' you proud. He's
saved my tail more'n a couple of times.

823
01:39:09,331 --> 01:39:11,622
Look Malla, I'd love to but, I can't.
I gotta get back

824
01:39:11,623 --> 01:39:13,912
to the Falcon before somebody
stumbles across her.

825
01:39:14,225 --> 01:39:17,493
Hey, will you look at Lumpy?
He's sure grown, huh?

826
01:39:18,403 --> 01:39:20,036
An' I think his voice is changin'.

827
01:39:21,212 --> 01:39:24,085
Come on, I'm just teasin' ya.
Well, look.

828
01:39:25,038 --> 01:39:27,162
I gotta go. Have a nice Life Day.

829
01:39:27,163 --> 01:39:29,653
But be careful, a lotta
troopers in the area.

830
01:39:30,056 --> 01:39:32,921
Chewie, check and see if the coast is
clear, will ya?

831
01:39:37,603 --> 01:39:40,060
You're like a family to me.

832
01:39:48,668 --> 01:39:51,297
I know, bye.

833
01:39:54,212 --> 01:39:54,931
Okay pal?

834
01:39:56,948 --> 01:39:58,198
Bye everybody.

835
01:39:59,343 --> 01:40:00,188
Well pal...

836
01:40:04,338 --> 01:40:05,522
be careful.

837
01:40:09,441 --> 01:40:11,551
They'll be lookin' for him.

838
01:40:14,047 --> 01:40:15,007
Take care.

839
01:41:35,938 --> 01:41:37,777
You sure know how to make a guy feel
welcome.

840
01:41:37,959 --> 01:41:39,242
Glad you're home, Chewbacca.

841
01:41:43,232 --> 01:41:46,069
If you're looking for who I'm thinking
you're looking for, forget him.

842
01:41:46,070 --> 01:41:48,039
We won't be bothered by him again.

843
01:41:53,114 --> 01:41:54,791
This is a general alert.

844
01:41:55,814 --> 01:42:00,619
Calling officer B-4711, officer B-4711.

845
01:42:00,620 --> 01:42:02,934
We are unable to reach
you on your comlink.

846
01:42:02,935 --> 01:42:04,713
Is there a problem?

847
01:42:05,213 --> 01:42:08,396
You are instructed to turn on
your comlink immediately.

848
01:42:10,464 --> 01:42:12,545
Wait, wait a minute.
I think I can handle this.

849
01:42:22,944 --> 01:42:25,068
We have two-way communication, trader
Saundan.

850
01:42:25,269 --> 01:42:28,270
Is this a report about
the missing trooper?

851
01:42:28,271 --> 01:42:29,271
It is, sir.

852
01:42:29,272 --> 01:42:32,002
Trooper B-4711 was here with
three other men.

853
01:42:32,108 --> 01:42:33,647
They left and he remained.

854
01:42:34,467 --> 01:42:35,549
As soon as they had gone,

855
01:42:35,749 --> 01:42:38,493
he packed a lot of food from
this house and robbed me blind.

856
01:42:38,494 --> 01:42:39,972
Then, he took off for the hills.

857
01:42:41,884 --> 01:42:43,506
Very well. We'll send
out a search party.

858
01:42:43,507 --> 01:42:44,927
Thank you.

859
01:42:50,408 --> 01:42:51,343
Yes, sir.

860
01:42:52,214 --> 01:42:54,076
Identification is very important.

861
01:42:54,858 --> 01:42:57,796
Helps you maintain contact with
the Empire at times like this.

862
01:43:03,141 --> 01:43:03,702
Lumpy.

863
01:43:04,796 --> 01:43:05,681
Itchy.

864
01:43:06,006 --> 01:43:06,906
Chewie.

865
01:43:07,538 --> 01:43:08,179
Malla.

866
01:43:09,315 --> 01:43:10,324
This day is for you.

867
01:43:12,276 --> 01:43:13,770
Have a wonderful celebration.

868
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:22,410
And may the force be with you.

869
01:47:46,764 --> 01:47:47,926
Happy Life Day.

870
01:47:52,797 --> 01:47:54,388
Happy Life Day, everyone.

871
01:48:00,276 --> 01:48:03,103
And, we're certainly glad that we
were allowed to celebrate it.

872
01:48:05,705 --> 01:48:06,726
Yes, Artoo.

873
01:48:10,024 --> 01:48:12,275
It is indeed true, that
at times like this,

874
01:48:12,310 --> 01:48:15,982
Artoo and I wish that we were more
than just mechanical beings...

875
01:48:17,347 --> 01:48:21,198
and were really alive, so that we
could share your feelings with you.

876
01:48:21,290 --> 01:48:22,422
Chewbacca!

877
01:48:23,111 --> 01:48:25,836
Chewbacca, we were so relieved to hear
you were alright.

878
01:48:29,628 --> 01:48:33,470
All of you are an important part of my
life, pal. I'm glad I could be here.

879
01:48:36,183 --> 01:48:37,665
This holiday is yours

880
01:48:37,666 --> 01:48:40,462
But we all share with you the
hope that this day brings

881
01:48:40,463 --> 01:48:43,258
us closer to freedom, and
to harmony, and to peace.

882
01:48:43,930 --> 01:48:45,770
No matter how different we appear,

883
01:48:45,848 --> 01:48:49,717
we're all the same in our struggle
against the powers of evil and darkness.

884
01:48:49,718 --> 01:48:53,005
I hope that this day will
always be a day of joy in

885
01:48:53,006 --> 01:48:56,291
which we can reconfirm our
dedication and our courage.

886
01:48:56,292 --> 01:49:00,060
And more than anything
else, our love for one another.

887
01:49:01,015 --> 01:49:02,986
This is the promise of the Tree of Life.

888
01:49:06,793 --> 01:49:11,103
We celebrate a day of peace.

889
01:49:12,653 --> 01:49:16,443
A day of harmony.

890
01:49:19,171 --> 01:49:23,896
A day of joy we can all share

891
01:49:25,236 --> 01:49:29,499
together joyously.

892
01:49:31,487 --> 01:49:35,868
A day that takes us
through the darkness.

893
01:49:37,548 --> 01:49:42,215
A day that leads us into might.

894
01:49:43,866 --> 01:49:48,612
A day that makes us want to
celebrate...

895
01:49:49,833 --> 01:49:53,384
the light.

896
01:49:58,823 --> 01:50:04,003
A day that brings the promise

897
01:50:04,934 --> 01:50:09,638
that one day, we'll be free

898
01:50:12,222 --> 01:50:13,560
to live,

899
01:50:14,539 --> 01:50:15,548
to laugh,

900
01:50:16,132 --> 01:50:16,855
to dream,

901
01:50:17,658 --> 01:50:18,355
to grow,

902
01:50:19,163 --> 01:50:19,834
to trust,

903
01:50:20,604 --> 01:50:24,108
to love,

904
01:50:25,316 --> 01:50:28,358
to be.
