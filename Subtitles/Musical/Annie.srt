<i>- [Door Slams]</i>
<i>- Okay, missy.</i>

341
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,328
I don't want you
ever to do this again,

342
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:50,568
so you're gonna scrub
every inch of this dump... with this.

343
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,735
- Glad you're back?
- Yes, Miss Hannigan.

344
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:57,178
Liar! What's the one thing
I always taught you?

345
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:00,115
Never tell a lie.

346
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:02,846
- That's right.
<i>- [Knocking]</i>

347
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,855
Excuse me. I was told I'd find
a Miss Hannigan here.

348
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:10,291
- And who might you be?
- I'm Grace Farrow. The City
Board of Orphans said...

349
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:15,628
Look, it was all a mistake. Somehow,
Annie got in the laundry basket.

350
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:18,965
Well, one thing led to another,
and I had to call the cops.
Please don't fire me!

351
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,597
I think you must have me
confused with somebody else.

352
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:25,267
Oh, I get it.
[Scoffs]

353
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:29,677
Uh, listen, honey, if you're peddlin'
beauty products, I don't need any.

354
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:32,306
Miss Hannigan,
I do not peddle anything.

355
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,783
I'm personal secretary
to Mr. Oliver Warbucks.

356
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,557
<i>- The</i> Oliver Warbucks?
- Yes.

357
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,389
- The richest man in the world?
- Yes.

358
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,123
The Board of Orphans
sent me here...

359
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:49,462
to extend Mr. Warbucks'
personal invitation to an orphan...

360
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:51,728
<i>to spend the holidays</i>
<i>in his home.</i>

361
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,134
I'm an orphan.
I can be ready in five minutes.

362
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:57,470
An orphan <i>child.</i>
Perhaps a child like this one.

363
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:59,702
Great idea. I'm a child,
and I'm an orphan.

364
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,836
A liar!
Annie ain't no orphan.

365
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:04,574
She's my little girl,
and she's nothing but trouble.

366
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,708
That seems hard to believe.

367
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:11,687
Look, you can have any orphan
in the joint, only you can't have Annie.

368
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,726
If this has something to do
with the laundry or the police,

369
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:17,727
perhaps the Board of Orphans
should know.

370
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:23,732
She's all yours.

371
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:26,895
- Merry Christmas.
- Good.

372
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:30,497
If you'll just sign the paperwork
and get Annie's coat.

373
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:34,008
Coat? Why would
a kid need a coat?

374
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:39,706
- We'll buy you one at Bergdorf's
on the way uptown.
- Really?

375
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:43,015
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Bergdorf's? Well, ain't we fancy?

376
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:46,923
- [Girls Gasping]
- You'll never guess what happened.

377
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:51,121
- I get to go away for Christmas.
- [Girls Cheering]

378
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,426

Bye, Annie! Bye!

Gee, it's really big.

386
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:38,502
Everybody!
Everybody,

387
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,773
this is our
Christmas guest, Annie.

388
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,407
Annie, this is...
everybody.

389
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:48,486
Hello, everybody.

390
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:50,611
Did Mr. Warbucks' plane
arrive yet?

391
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:53,520
He called from Teeterboro.
His airplane's been delayed,

392
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,525
but he's on his way.

393
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,619
- May I take your coat, miss?
- Will I get it back?

394
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,164
- [Chuckles]
- Of course you will, honey.

395
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:05,168
Now tell me, what would you like
to do first?

396
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:10,832
The floors. I'll scrub them,
and then I'll do the windows!

397
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:14,639
No, Annie, Annie!
You're Mr. Warbucks' guest.

398
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:19,046
- You're here to have fun.
- Really?

399
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,551
Really. Now, we've ordered in
special things just for you.

400
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:27,023
Mr. Warbucks instructed me to make sure
that for the next two weeks...

401
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,355
you have a swell time here.

402
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,691
# Cecile will pick out
all your clothes #

403
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:35,698
You mean I get
to wear new things?

404
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,736
#Your bath is drawn
by Mrs. Greer #

405
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,534
Really? A bath?
All for me?

406
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,041
#Annette comes in
to make your bed #

407
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:49,079
I get my own bed too?

408
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:53,583
# I think I'm gonna
like it here #

409
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:59,216
#The swimming pool
is to the left #

410
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:02,157
A pool?
Inside?

411
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,991
#The tennis court is
in the rear #

412
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:08,895
Aw, gee, I don't know
how to play.

413
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,333
# Have an instructor
here at noon #

414
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:15,406
You'll be playing
like a pro in no time.

415
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:20,068
# I think I'm gonna
like it here #

ring for Drake #

00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:31,216
# Drake will bring
your tray #

#When you're through
Mrs. Pugh #

419
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:39,193
# Comes to take it away #

420
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:56,575
# No need to pick up
any toys #

421
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:59,775
The kids'll never
believe this.

422
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:02,648
# No finger will you lift #

423
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,451

[All]
#We have but one request #

425

# Please put us to the test #

# I know I'm gonna
like it here #

427
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,017
# Used to room
in a tomb #

428
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:15,286
#Where I'd sit and freeze #

429
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:18,521
# Get me now
Holy cow #

430
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:21,393
# Could someone pinch me #

431
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,399
# Please #

432
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:32,136
#We never had
a little girl #

[All]
#We never had a little girl #

434
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:41,982
# I'm very glad
to volunteer #

#We hope you understand #

00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:48,724
#Your wish is our command #

# Like it here ##

439
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,613
- Who are you?
- I'm Annie.

440
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,581
<i>Welcome home, Mr. War</i>b<i>ucks.</i>
<i>How was your trip?</i>

441
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:17,745
Don't ask me about my trip.
It was a nightmare.

442
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:21,586
My factories are shutting down
right and left. It's bad, very bad.

443
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:23,592
I'll be in my study.
Mrs. Pugh, bring me a sandwich.

444
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:26,390
President Roosevelt phoned. He's
awaiting your call at the White House.

445
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:29,057
Fine.

446
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:33,365
- What did you say your name was?
- Annie, sir.

447
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,564
Is there any particular reason
why you're here?

448
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:38,574
With all the negative press
you've been receiving, sir.

449
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:41,975
- Oh, yes, right.
- Annie is the orphan
you invited for Christmas.

450
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,483
- You're a girl. Orphans are boys.
- You didn't specify boy, sir.

451
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,246
Aw, gee, Mr. Warbucks, sir,
that's okay.

452
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:51,253
You can trade me in
for a boy.

453
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:54,256
I really liked seeing your house.
It sure is big.

454
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,595
Annie,

455
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:04,634
I couldn't be
more delighted...

456
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:09,570
that you'll be spending Christmas
here with me in my big house.

457
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,675
What are we
supposed to do with her?

458
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:17,771
Well, it is Annie's
first night here, so...

459
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:19,782
Then come to my club
for dinner and cigars.

460
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,852
Sir, your club is
for men only.

461
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:25,480
- And I don't smoke.
- I see.

462
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,785
- Then how about a brandy?
- How about a Broadway show?

463
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:30,087
Gee, I've never been
to one of those before.

464
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:34,425
Then you'll attend
a Broadway show... with Grace.

465
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,737
I thought
you were going out.

466
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:50,541
Oh, yes, well, see,
Mr. Warbucks,

467
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:54,277
I've never met anybody with a real job,
except Mr. Bundles,

468
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:57,149
so I'd kinda like
to watch you work.

469
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:00,156
Fine. Sometime
when I'm not busy.

470
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,158
Sir, you're never not busy.

471
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,694
Oh.

472
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:06,695
All right.

473
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,913
Well, that's about it.
Good-bye.

474
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:28,076
Couldn't I watch
just a few more minutes?

475
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:34,649
My assessment of the situation,
Mr. President? Well, it's
pretty darned bad out there.

476
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:38,559
My factories... everybody's factories...
are shutting down.

477
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:41,496
Mr. President, I know
you're feeling pressure.

478
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:48,029
I'm feeling pressure myself
at this very moment.

479
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,039
You're coming to New York
for the holidays?

480
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:52,268
- Invite him for Christmas!
- Why don't you and Mrs. Roosevelt...

481
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:57,279
<i>spend</i> C<i>hristmas with me</i>
<i>and my new... Annie?</i>

482
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:01,346
Excellent!
He said yes!

483
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:04,216
That's wonderful news.

484
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,722
So the President of the United States
is coming to your house for Christmas?

485
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:08,621
For Christmas dinner.
I wonder what Democrats eat.

486
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:11,787
Let's go out and celebrate with Annie.
We'll show her the town.

487
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,364
- Too much work, Grace.
- That's okay, sir.

488
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:18,765
I've never seen New York before,
so I'm just as happy to watch you work.

489
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:22,134
You're telling me you live in New York
City and haven't seen the place?

490
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,107
- Miss Hannigan...
- She runs the orphanage.

491
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:29,270
Well, she never lets
us kids out.

492
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,280
What's New York City like
anyway?

493
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,748
Well, it's...

494
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:38,549
Hmm?
Let me think.

495
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,657

Annie, before we eat,

681
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:08,990
there's something
I want to ask you.

682
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:12,823
But first... Did you know
that I was an orphan?

683
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:14,487
No, sir.

684
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:18,432
I lost my parents
when I was very young, and,

685
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:20,662
well, from that day on,

686
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:24,866
I vowed to work very hard
and become very rich.

687
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,307
- And that's just what he did.
- Yes.

688
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:32,040
But, Annie,
l-l-I never realized...

689
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,515
- U-Until he met you...
- Exactly.

690
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:38,782
I mean, what's life about...

691
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:41,551
if you don't have anyone
to share it with?

692
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:44,354
- D-Do you follow me?
- Sure.

693
00:52:47,063 --> 00:52:49,827
No, not really.

694
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:51,525
Oh.

695
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:57,138
Maybe this will
explain it better.

696
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:06,706
Oh, gee, thank you, sir.

697
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:09,216
L-I noticed that old broken one
you always wear,

698
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:12,049
and I thought, off with the old,
on with the new.

699
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:14,885
No!
I don't want a new one!

700
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:16,891
My mom and dad left me
with this one...

701
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:19,860
and a note saying
they'd come back for me someday.

707
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:41,413
If it's your parents you want,
then I'll find them for you.

708
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:43,884
But I'll need your locket
and that note...

709
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:47,423

to your mother and dad.

01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:15,781
and any specific details
will be most helpful.

835
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:20,018
Sir, I think every liar,
thief and crackpot...

836
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:22,120
showed up
on our doorstep today.

837
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:26,531
So many sob stories, but nobody
mentioned giving Annie the locket.

838
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,867
Did they show up yet?

839
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:34,033
It appears that everyone who claims
they were your parents are fakes.

840
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:39,479
Oh. Well, I'm sure
my real parents'll show up.

841
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:41,880
Maybe they missed their train
or got lost or something.

842
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:44,817
Sir, this just arrived
via special messenger from the F.B.I.

843
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:47,617
Good. The information
about Annie's locket.

844
01:03:47,723 --> 01:03:50,954
"Between 1918 and 1924,

845
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:54,518
90,000 of Annie's type of locket
were made and sold."

846
01:03:56,132 --> 01:04:00,535
The F.B.I. Says it's impossible
to trace your parents through it.

847
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:05,337
I'm so, so very sorry.

848
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:10,844
Drake, let's you and I
check on the Christmas menu.

849
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:14,340
You did the best
you could, sir.

850
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:17,078
<i>Thank you</i>
<i>for all you've done.</i>

851
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:20,815
You know, I guess a kid
can do okay without parents.

852
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:23,517
Looks like you got
everything <i>you</i> wanted.

853
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:27,687
I'm afraid
that isn't so, Annie.

854
01:04:29,966 --> 01:04:34,027
# I've made me a fortune #

855
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:37,401
#That fortune made ten #

856
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:40,566
# Been headlined
and profiled #

857
01:04:40,676 --> 01:04:44,271
#Again and again #

858
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:47,747
# But something
was missing #

859
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:51,183
# I never quite knew #

860
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:55,053
#That something was someone #

861
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:58,854
# But who #

862
01:04:58,961 --> 01:05:01,862
# My speeches are greeted #

863
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:05,229
#With thunderous acclaim #

864
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:08,599
#At two universities #

865
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:11,264
# Bearing my name #

866
01:05:11,374 --> 01:05:15,037
#Yes, something was missing #

867
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:18,375
# Each time I got through #

868
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:21,939
#That something was someone #

869
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:25,316
# But who #

870
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:28,618
#Who could #

871
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:32,091
#That someone be #

872
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:35,391
# How could she make it #

873
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:38,729
# Known #

874
01:05:38,834 --> 01:05:44,431
#Who would need me #

875
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:47,236
# For me #

876
01:05:47,343 --> 01:05:51,643
# Need me for me #

877
01:05:51,747 --> 01:05:55,649
#Alone #

878
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:29,650
Annie,

879
01:06:29,752 --> 01:06:33,415
I love you as if you were
my own little girl.

880
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:39,219
I want to adopt you.
Would you consider it?

881
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:44,792
It's just that I love
my real mother and father so much.

882
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,368
I don't know if I could love
anybody else.

883
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:52,539
I understand,

884
01:06:52,641 --> 01:06:57,203
but if you could find
a place in your heart for me...

885
01:06:57,313 --> 01:07:00,874
#The world was
my oyster #

886
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:04,680
# But where was
the pearl #

887
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:07,847
#Who dreamed
I would find it #

888
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:11,188
# In one little girl #

889
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:15,161
#Yes, something
was missing #

890
01:07:15,264 --> 01:07:20,600
# But dreams
do come true #

891
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,672
#That something #

892
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:28,176
# Is no one #

893
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:32,611
# But you #

894
01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:39,077
Mr. Warbucks, if I can't
have my real parents,

895
01:07:39,188 --> 01:07:42,248
I think I'd really like it
if you'd be my father.

896
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:52,300
I have an idea.
Grace!

897
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:55,632
- Yes, Mr. Warbucks.
Is everything all right?
- C<i>ouldn't</i> b<i>e</i> b<i>etter.</i>

898
01:07:55,738 --> 01:08:00,766
TelephoneJustice Brandeis
and ask him to come over
to sign the adoption papers.

899
01:08:00,876 --> 01:08:04,107
Oh!
That's wonderful news!

900
01:08:04,213 --> 01:08:06,613
Oh, Mr. Warbucks,
that's wonderful ne...

901
01:08:06,715 --> 01:08:09,479
Um, when shall I tell
the judge to come?

902
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:14,488
Well, Grace, it's Christmas Eve.
Let's have the adoption tonight
and a big party as well.

903
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:19,994
- Tell Mrs. Pugh to order in
flowers, champagne, caviar.
- And ice cream and roasted corn.

904
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,997
Did you hear the little lady?
Ice cream and roasted corn...

905
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:26,125
and all the Christmas decorations
left in the city of New York.

906
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:30,797
- Yes, sir.
- And Grace, extend our invitation
to everyone in the house.

907
01:08:30,906 --> 01:08:33,602
Miss Grace,
will you be there too?

908
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:35,973
'Cause it's really nice
when you're both together.

909
01:08:37,413 --> 01:08:39,813
Grace, will you join us?

910
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:42,145
Well, I'd be honored.

911
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:44,583
Wonderful.
Let's get ready.

912
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:46,814
L-I'll take care of everything!

913
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:26,558
Mr. Warbucks,
the house is ready.

914
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:33,033
<i>[Sighs]</i>
<i>Drake,</i>

915
01:09:33,135 --> 01:09:35,865
it's never looked better.

916
01:09:35,971 --> 01:09:38,872
You've <i>really</i> outdone
yourself this time.

917
01:09:38,974 --> 01:09:41,534
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

918
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:44,704
Annie!
Are you ready?

919
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:51,511
Leapin' lizards!
Just look at this joint!

920
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:55,855
- You know what, Annie?
- What?

921
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:58,392
I think I'm the luckiest man
in the world.

922
01:09:58,494 --> 01:10:01,429
And I think
I'm the luckiest kid.

#Together at last #

924
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:06,891
#Together forever #

#They never can sever #

# I don't need sunshine now

#You've made life a song #

01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:34,788
#You made me the singer #

01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:38,298
#And what's that

# Ba, ba, ba anything

#You can say that

938
01:10:51,313 --> 01:10:54,077
#Yesterday
was plain awful #

- Yes, sir.

The house is all spiffed up.
Looks like we're ready.

That's a very pretty dress
you're wearing,

965
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:23,900
and you look
very pretty in it.

966
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:26,406

So happy you could make it
on such short notice.

970
01:12:32,915 --> 01:12:35,816
Happy to be here to preside
over this momentous occasion.

971
01:12:35,918 --> 01:12:38,887
- And this is Annie.
- Oh, how nice to meet you.

972
01:12:38,987 --> 01:12:42,514
Well, Oliver, Annie,
I'm ready to begin if you are.

973
01:12:42,624 --> 01:12:44,683
- I'm ready, Judge.
- Me too.

974
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:47,523
- [Barking]
- I guess it's unanimous.

975
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:50,564
- Shall we begin?
<i>- Sir?</i>

976
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:55,530
Sir, before you start...

977
01:12:55,637 --> 01:12:59,573
<i>May I present the Mudges.</i>

- There she is.
- [Crying]

980
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:09,283
- Who are you?
- We're your mommy and daddy.

981
01:13:10,519 --> 01:13:12,749
- [Barking]
- Mind your manners.

982
01:13:12,855 --> 01:13:16,222
We're Ralph
and Shirley Mudge.

983
01:13:16,325 --> 01:13:20,785
- Ain't she cute, Ralphie?
- Oh, she's a regular doll.

984
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:22,921
Annie <i>Mudge</i>?

985
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:25,431
- [Growling]
- Sandy! Shh! Be polite.

986
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:28,025
Drake, please.

987
01:13:28,137 --> 01:13:32,096
Perhaps we should
discuss this privately.

988
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:37,907
- Well, we was kids and poor, sick...
- And dumb to leave you.

989
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:39,947
But we had no choice.

990
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:44,951
You see, a nice man in Canada
offered us a job on a farm.

991
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:46,953
- No babies allowed.
- No.

992
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:50,991
So, we had to leave ya
for a little while.

993
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:54,494
Eleven years is more
than a little while.

994
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:58,464
Mr. And Mrs. Mudge, yours is
a touching story, but...

995
01:13:58,567 --> 01:14:02,298
But l-l-I suppose
you'd like to see some I.D.

996
01:14:02,404 --> 01:14:06,135
<i>Well, here's</i>
<i>our driver's licenses...</i>

997
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:10,007
and, um, Annie's
birth certificate.

998
01:14:14,917 --> 01:14:20,321
<i>It appears to</i> b<i>e in order.</i>
<i>Born: New York, Octo</i>b<i>er 28, 1922.</i>

999
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:23,983
- That's my birthday.
- Those are the dates in Annie's note.

1000
01:14:24,092 --> 01:14:27,687
Yes, but I'm still not sure.

1001
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:33,991
Finally, we saved up enough money
to come looking for our little girl.

1002
01:14:34,102 --> 01:14:37,765
<i>We got into town, and we went straight</i>
<i>to where we left our little</i> b<i>a</i>b<i>y.</i>

1003
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:40,501
And the very nice...
and very attractive...

1004
01:14:40,609 --> 01:14:43,476
lady at the orphanage said
we'd find Annie here.

1005
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:47,972
- I still can't believe
we found our baby.
- Me neither.

1006
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:50,017
[Both Sobbing]

1007
01:14:50,118 --> 01:14:54,680
Mr. And Mrs. Mudge,
there is one more thing.

1008
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:59,989
Oh! You know, with all the thievin'
that goes on in orphanages,

1009
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:03,690
I bet you don't have what
we left with you all those years ago.

1010
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:09,703
You wouldn't happen to have
the other half of this?

1011
01:15:09,805 --> 01:15:11,705
Would you?

1012
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:17,711
- [Gasping]
<i>- Look, Ralphie!</i>
- The locket.

1013
01:15:17,813 --> 01:15:19,713
<i>She's wearin'it!</i>

1014
01:15:19,815 --> 01:15:23,717
Perfect fit, so if you just get
Annie's things, we'll be on our way.

1015
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:25,753
Mr. Mudge.

1016
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:29,483
- What about the money?
- Oh, of course.

1017
01:15:29,591 --> 01:15:32,389
You'll be wanting something
for having taken care of her.

1018
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:34,826
<i>Well, we ain't got much,</i>

1019
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:37,558
but... here.

1020
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:42,160
You didn't know that Mr. Warbucks
was offering a $50,000 reward...

1021
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:45,672
<i>- for the couple who can prove</i>
<i>they're Annie's parents?</i>
- He is?

1022
01:15:45,774 --> 01:15:48,572
Well, we sure don't want
no money.

1023
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:51,077
- No, no, no, no.
- J<i>ust... We want our little girl.</i>

1024
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:54,273
Come on, Pa.

1025
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:59,619
On the other hand,

1026
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:07,127
with $50,000,

1027
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:10,426
we could afford
to bring Annie up right.

1028
01:16:10,532 --> 01:16:13,797
- Uh-huh.
- [Stammering] In what form
might this money be?

1029
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:15,802
Certified check.

1030
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:19,874
You can pick it up
tomorrow with Annie.

1031
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:21,875
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?

1032
01:16:21,977 --> 01:16:25,276
<i>I'd like Annie to spend</i>
C<i>hristmas morning with us.</i>

1033
01:16:26,648 --> 01:16:28,548
If that suits you?

1034
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:30,641
Oh, yes, please.

1035
01:16:33,055 --> 01:16:35,819
We've lived without her
for 11 years.

1036
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:38,654
I guess one more night
won't hurt.

1037
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,660
Come, Shirley.

1038
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:42,957
Wait, I just want one more look
at my sweet angel!

1039
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:47,832
<i>She's a dream! A dream!</i>

Come on. Let's join
the rest of the guests,

1042
01:16:57,245 --> 01:16:59,145
tell them
your wonderful news.

1043
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:10,489
<i>Thank you, Drake.</i>

1044
01:17:11,927 --> 01:17:16,387
Everyone, Annie has
finally found her parents.

1045
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:22,001
- Here's to Annie Mudge.
- [All] To Annie Mudge.

1046
01:17:44,259 --> 01:17:48,628
# Silly to cry
Nothing to fear #

1047
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:53,224
# Betcha where they live's

1048
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:58,034
# Betcha your life

1049
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:00,199
# Lookin' at them #

1050
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:05,041
# It's easy to tell #

1051
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:13,553
#The sun'll come out
tomorrow #

1052
01:18:13,655 --> 01:18:18,251
# Bet your bottom dollar
that tomorrow #

1053
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,692
#There'll be sun #

1054
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:25,863
#Just thinkin' about
tomorrow #

1055
01:18:25,967 --> 01:18:30,563
# Clears away the cobwebs
and the sorrow #

1056
01:18:30,672 --> 01:18:34,608
#Till there's none #

1057
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:37,235
#When you're stuck
with a day #

1058
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:40,906
#That's grey and lonely #

1059
01:18:41,016 --> 01:18:44,782
#You just stick out your chin
and grin #

1060
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:50,256
#And say #

1061
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:55,420
#The sun'll come out
tomorrow #

1062
01:18:55,530 --> 01:19:00,627
# So you gotta hang on
till tomorrow #

1063
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:04,228
# Come what may #

1064
01:19:04,339 --> 01:19:07,274
#Tomorrow, tomorrow #

1065
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:11,471
# I love ya tomorrow #

1066
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:16,779
#You're only a day #

1067
01:19:16,885 --> 01:19:25,293
#Away ##

1068
01:19:34,402 --> 01:19:37,132
Aw, come on, why can't I
go with youse guys?

1069
01:19:37,239 --> 01:19:39,639
'Cause you can't leave children
all alone, that's why.

1070
01:19:39,741 --> 01:19:42,301
Huh! Since when did you care
about those little tykes?

1071
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:46,608
It's Christmas. My heart is full
of glad tidings of great joy.

1072
01:19:46,715 --> 01:19:51,175
- Now let's go get that raggedy Annie.
- Catch you later, baby doll.

1073
01:19:52,521 --> 01:19:56,423
But l-l-I ain't the motherly type.
[Coughs]

1074
01:20:08,203 --> 01:20:10,831
- Merry Christmas, Annie.
- Merry Christmas, Annie.

1075
01:20:10,939 --> 01:20:12,839
<i>Merry</i> C<i>hristmas.</i>

1076
01:20:12,941 --> 01:20:15,205
Did you look under the tree to see
if Santa left you anything?

1077
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:19,041
No, he brought me my parents.
That's plenty.

1078
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:22,882
Think they'll let me
keep Sandy...

1079
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:27,011
and let me come visit you,
sir, and Miss Grace?

1080
01:20:27,122 --> 01:20:29,989
Yes, of course,
they will.

1081
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:32,889
You look like
you didn't get any sleep.

1082
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:37,488
Oh, yes, well, we've been
talking with the president...

1083
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:41,160
and working with the F.B.I.
All through the night,

1084
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:43,362
and they haven't turned up
anything suspicious, so...

1085
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:48,135
So I'm really a Mudge...
Annie Mudge.

1086
01:20:48,243 --> 01:20:50,711
Where's our little
Christmas present?

1087
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:54,805
- We know she's here somewhere.
- Mr. And Mrs. Mudge.

1088
01:20:54,916 --> 01:20:57,885
- [Barking]
- [Whimpering]

1089
01:20:57,986 --> 01:21:01,217
You will let me keep him,
won't you?

1090
01:21:01,323 --> 01:21:03,985
- Why, of course.
- [Barks]

1091
01:21:04,092 --> 01:21:07,255
The only thing I love more than
little girls is little dogs.

1092
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:09,262
Don't I, Ralphie?

1093
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:11,264
Come on, Sandy.

1094
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:15,564
Well, we better be on our way
with our little Annie.

1095
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:20,164
- And our little check.
- So soon? Annie hasn't even
opened her presents yet.

1096
01:21:20,275 --> 01:21:23,938
- Sorry, we ain't got time.
- Very well.

1097
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:26,741
If you'll come this way,
we'll prepare the check.

1098
01:21:28,783 --> 01:21:31,251
- Darn. Lost again.
- [Girls Laughing]

1099
01:21:31,353 --> 01:21:34,083
Gosh! You sure you girls
never played poker before?

1100
01:21:34,189 --> 01:21:36,521
Beginner's luck.
How much she owe us?

1101
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:40,925
$479.39.

1102
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:43,088
What? Where am I gonna get
that kind of loot?

1103
01:21:44,532 --> 01:21:47,968
Hey, why am I worryin'?

1104
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:51,630
I'll be rollin' in it when Rooster
and Hannigan get back from Warbucks'.

1105
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,265
- That's where Annie is.
- Oops.

1106
01:21:54,376 --> 01:21:58,278
What's goin' on?
Spill the beans.

1107
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:01,281
Nuh-uh.
My lipstick is sealed.

1108
01:22:01,383 --> 01:22:03,783
Yeah, but your purse ain't.

1109
01:22:03,885 --> 01:22:06,285
Hey, give that back
right now!

1110
01:22:06,388 --> 01:22:10,984
Yeah, I'm sure the cops'll
be very interested in your fake I.D.s.

1111
01:22:11,092 --> 01:22:14,323
[Screams]
You watch it. Get out of my way.

1112
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:17,455
I want those back right now.

1113
01:22:17,565 --> 01:22:20,090
Fess up!

1114
01:22:20,201 --> 01:22:23,295
Okay, okay!
Rooster and Hannigan are pretending...

1115
01:22:23,405 --> 01:22:27,136
to be Annie's parents
for the reward money.

1116
01:22:27,242 --> 01:22:29,972
And when they get back,

1117
01:22:30,078 --> 01:22:32,979
I'll be sittin' large
and livin' pretty.

1118
01:22:33,081 --> 01:22:36,141
What makes you so sure
they'll be comin' back?

1119
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:38,981
[Chuckles]
Because I'm Rooster's dame.

1120
01:22:39,087 --> 01:22:42,989
He'd never let me take the rap
and spend three months on Rikers Island.

1121
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:47,519
Again.

1122
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:51,462
Sir, the Mudges'
certified check for $50,000.

1123
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:54,194
- Well, nice meeting you all.
- We'd better get.

1124
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:57,328
Cheerio. Toodle-oo. Ta-ta.
See you in church.

1126
01:23:01,776 --> 01:23:03,801
Oh! How silly of us.

1127
01:23:03,912 --> 01:23:06,540
We've been childless for so long,
it's gonna take some getting used to.

1128
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:10,448
- Come on, precious. So sweet.
- Come, Annie.

1129
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:19,517
- [Muffled] Come on.
- Unhand me!

1130
01:23:19,627 --> 01:23:23,859
- You messed with the wrong dame!
- What are you doin' here?

1131
01:23:23,965 --> 01:23:27,901
Makin' sure I get my piece of the cake.
I want my moolah.

Out of my way!

ever shut its doors?

Uh, it was his idea.
He made me do it.

Annie, Annie, tell these people
how good I always been to ya, huh?

1150
01:24:29,864 --> 01:24:35,097
Miss Hannigan, I would, but
the one thing you always taught me was:

1151
01:24:35,203 --> 01:24:37,103
Never tell a lie.

1152
01:24:38,506 --> 01:24:41,805
Brat! I'll let you in

I never liked you. Never. You're
nothing but a rotten gold digger.

I've always been so good to ya,

1163
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:19,308
Annie, I also have
some important news for you.

1164
01:25:19,414 --> 01:25:21,314
Oliver.

1165
01:25:24,252 --> 01:25:29,246
The F.B.I. Were finally able to trace
the handwriting on that note of yours...

1166
01:25:29,357 --> 01:25:32,417
to a David and Margaret Bennett.

1167
01:25:34,028 --> 01:25:38,328
You mean the Bennetts
are my real parents? Where are they?

1168
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:45,838
Annie, I'm sorry, it seems
they passed away some time ago.

1169
01:25:47,642 --> 01:25:52,045
So, I really <i>am</i> an orphan.

1170
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:04,216
Annie, are you
all right?

1171
01:26:06,728 --> 01:26:08,628
Yeah.

1172
01:26:08,730 --> 01:26:10,630
I think so.

1173
01:26:12,467 --> 01:26:17,166
See, I always knew
my parents loved me,

1174
01:26:17,272 --> 01:26:20,503
and they'd come back for me,

1175
01:26:20,608 --> 01:26:22,508
if they were alive.

1176
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:31,346
I guess you have to look
at the bright side.

1177
01:26:31,452 --> 01:26:33,886
At least I'm not a Mudge.

1178
01:26:33,988 --> 01:26:37,014
[All Laughing]

1179
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:40,720
I hope this is the start
of a wonderful new life for all of us.

1180
01:26:40,828 --> 01:26:46,061
<i>And I'll see to it that</i>
<i>each and every one of you...</i>

1181
01:26:46,167 --> 01:26:49,500
will be adopted
by a fine, upstanding family.

[Cheering]

1183
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:54,740
And Annie picked out Christmas presents
for all of you.

1184
01:26:54,842 --> 01:26:59,245
- They're waiting
underneath the Christmas tree.

1185
01:26:59,347 --> 01:27:04,876
Grace! When I talk about
a new life for all of us...

1186
01:27:04,986 --> 01:27:07,420
I do mean all of us.

1187
01:27:11,726 --> 01:27:16,095
And if you'd still like
to be Annie Bennett Warbucks...

1188
01:27:16,197 --> 01:27:18,791
I'd like that
more than anything.

1189
01:27:20,201 --> 01:27:22,101
I love you very much, Annie.

1190
01:27:22,203 --> 01:27:25,104
And I love you,
Daddy Warbucks.
