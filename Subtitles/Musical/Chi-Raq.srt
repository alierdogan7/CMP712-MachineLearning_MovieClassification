is the black suit undertaker.

176
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,765
But don't pity our pain.

177
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,850
Might ain't always right,
ain't you heard?

178
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,968
And this coming from a natural man.

179
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:28,289
Baby, you come face to face
with the super bad Mr. Dolmedes.

180
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,405
My black ass
was on the first box of Wheaties.

181
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,444
I was raised up in a pail
of rusted nails.

182
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,370
Ran butt-naked
through golf ball-sized hail.

183
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,763
<i>Was weaned on thunderbird
from my mama's tities.</i>

184
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,131
Kicked ass from coast to coast,
till both shoe toes were shitty.

185
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,444
Chewed up electric lines
and pissed out lightning bolts.

186
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,087
Hit Godzilla so hard,
it gave my poor daddy a jolt.

187
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,085
Sank the Titanic, with a frozen turd,

188
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,731
then won ten Grammys

189
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,486
and didn't sing or rap
one Goddamn motherfuckin' word.

190
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,002
<i>Now,</i> I <i>told you
about The Signifying Monkey.</i>

191
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,721
And rapped about <i>Shine</i>
but this here tale of two cities,

192
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,169
is one of a kind.

193
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,688
It all started with a gorgeous
nubian sister.

194
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,162
Baby's so fine
she made George Zimmerman

195
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,004
and Darren Wilson wanna kiss her.

196
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,006
<i>"DOLMEDES: As Tough as Coffy
and sexy as Foxy Brown!</i>

197
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,761
<i>Hell, Beyonce Knowles herself

198
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,524
<i>They call her Lysistrata.</i>

199
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,204
A woman like no other.

Dis Chocolate Brown Sistah
was Finer'n a Muthafucka!

201
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,888
She could put fear in a Pitbull.
Made Bruce Lee flee.

202
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,531
Knocked out Frazier and Ali,

203
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,120
den ran Money Mayweather up a
sycamore tree.

204
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,921
<i>Wit' a mind like Einstein.

00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,127

211
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,601
Messed up.

212
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,041
Barbara, did you see the shooter?

213
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,527
Oh, boy.

214
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,161
- Somebody called me to tell me that...
- Ma'am, please.

215
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,531
What happened? What's going on?

216
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,281
My baby-

217
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,441
That's my...

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,647
Ma'am, please.

219
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,121
Is that?

220
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,244
- Is that... What happened?
- Ma'am.

221
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,767
You have to go down to the morgue
for identification, ma'am.

222
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,481
That's my baby.

00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,446
- Patti.
- You can't cross the line, ma'am.

Please.

Ain't nobody out here see nothin'?

00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,284
And I even can't get to my own child.

230
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,481
I'm sorry, ma'am.

231
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,601
What happened?

232
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,727
Don't touch me!

233
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,006
You don't even deserve

234
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,162
to look at my child's body
laying right on this ground!

235
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,241
None of you.

00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,610
You gonna get your day, Lysistrata.

You and your damn boyfriend.

00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,327
You got what's coming for you.

00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,210
I want you to look at her,
look at her right there.

That's a seven... A little baby!

241
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,241
A baby.

242
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,127
A baby.

243
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,765
I can't take this anymore.

244
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,641
Your daughter is in heaven.

245
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,971
It could be you, next time. Will you
be standin' around lookin' then?

246
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,810
This "Nuthin" ' has no where to go.

247
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,241
Welcome to my home.

248
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,483
Come on in. Come on.

249
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,360
HELEN: Why don't you move in
with that boy of yours?

251
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,401
Wouldn't be safe.

252
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,131
I suppose he'll be gunnin'
for who set that fire.

253
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,364
Y'all make my tired ass tired.

254
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,809
There are children here in Englewood!
Does that mean anything to you?

255
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,283
Runnin' up the street.
Shootin' and killin'.

256
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,130
Do you care at all?

257
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,162
- Maybe I should leave.
- No. Sit.

259
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,882
You're gonna deal with this today.

260
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,883
- You don't have any family?
- No, ma'am.

261
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,561
I'm an orphan.

262
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,161
My moma put me up for
adoption at birth.

263
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,721
I grew up moving from
one Group Home to another.

264
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,769
Lord, help you, child.

265
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,566
Where's your flatscreen?

266
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,290
Malcom X once said,

267
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,761
"The best way to hide something
from negros,"

268
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,605
"is to put it in a book."

269
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,081
Well, I can dig it, Miss Helen.

270
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,011
You sure got mad books.

271
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,406
Books are my life.

272
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,401
My life are books.

273
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,409
- You always lived here?
- No.

274
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,765
I lived in Cabrini Green
back when it was clean,

275
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,445
before they knocked it down.

276
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,644
Oh, lot of black folk
got gentrified across town.

277
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,450
- Who's this?
- My daughter.

278
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,921
Pam.

279
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,001
Let me guess.

280
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,525
- Ten?
- That's right.

281
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,844
HELEN: Fifth grade, class picture.

282
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,721
[GUNSHOT]
Girl, come away from that window!

283
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,641
Chi-Raq.

284
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,246
Chi-Raq.

285
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,240
I hate that name.

286
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,521
It's not who we are.

287
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,571
Chicago has always been
a straight-up gangster town.

288
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,446
- We are not Chi-Raqs.
- What do you call all these shootings?

289
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,650
Crime, doing time.

290
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,484
It's not just about Chicago.

291
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,604
What about Bodymore Murderland?

292
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,921
Killadelphia.

293
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,924
City of brotherly murder.

294
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,889
Bucktown. Brooklyn, New York.

295
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,766
So many people getting shot,
hospitals goin' broke!

296
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,766
I mean, you got to get on the E-way,
people dying enroute.

297
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,604
They can't even file a lawsuit.

298
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,684
I mean, there ain't no trauma centers
here on the Southside.

299
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,240
There was a time in summer
when it got hot,

300
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,688
your child could go outside and play
and not get shot.

301
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,962
- Well, I don't remember that time.
- It existed.

302
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,964
I'm sorry, Miss Helen,
but it's a war zone here.

303
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,811
The US spends money
on the Iraqi people,

304
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,163
to train them, govern them,
helped them build an economy.

305
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,691
Billions and billions in dollars.

306
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,525
The Afghan people too.

307
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,969
They don't do economic development
like that here on Southside.

308
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,970
See, Americans like war.

309
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,085
They like guns.

310
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,721
Fun and games.

311
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,801
Fun and games?

312
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,002
Ask the parents at Sandy Hook.

313
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,925
When they murdered white babies
and things don't change.

314
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,971
Saving black life is way out of range.

315
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,166
I keep thinking of that mother
that lost her child.

316
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,361
You should.

317
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,244
This boy, you with?

318
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,641
- Chi-Raq?
- What?

319
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,807
That's what they call him.

320
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,050
Wait a minute now. Hold on.

321
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,570
They call him Chi-Raq?

322
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,007
Yes, ma'am.

323
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,642
Lord, have mercy.

324
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,120
Well, he's a rapper.

325
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,245
I mean, he's gonna be big time famous.

326
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,646
You really never heard of him?

327
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,849
I heard he was the leader
in this gang mess, girl.

328
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,566
Oh, Miss Helen,
they don't say "gang" anymore.

329
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,201
They say organization.

330
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,890
What is his real name?

331
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,371
His government name?

332
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,361
Nah.

333
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,841
Demetrius.

334
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,446
Demetrius DuPree.

335
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,808
Demetrius DuPree.

336
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,041
His father?

337
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,001
All Chi's told me
is that he died in prison.

338
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,248
He's got a good heart
deep down inside.

339
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,281
I love him.

340
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,762
- I can change Chi.
- Darling.

341
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,890
People change
when they decide to change.

342
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,770
You make it sound so easy.

343
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,850
All you can do
is create an environment for change.

344
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,730
Like an alcoholic,
you take away his booze.

345
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,326
You just try taking away their guns.

346
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,801
All right.
Well, what else do they love?

347
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,928
- Getting turned up, making money.
- What else?

348
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,810
[CHUCKLING] Yeah, Well.

349
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,041

to the Second Liberian Civil War
in 2003.

<i>REPORTER: Irene, your daughter is another
victim to the senseless violence</i>

<i>here in Englewood
on the Southside of Chicago.</i>

360
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,528
<i>What do you want people to know?
What can people do?</i>

361
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,365
IRENE: <i>You know these babies don't asked
to be caught in the middle of this.</i>

362
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,481
<i>They don't.</i>

366
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,650
What's up, girlfriend?

367

You unhappy stayin'
at Miss Helen's crib?

368
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,282
You know how old people live.

369
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,850
That ain't the thing, Rasheeda.

370
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,641
- I'm on fire.
- Burn, baby, burn.

371
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,371
We agreed to hook up, make this plan.

372
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,971
Where da Females at? Huh?

373
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,689
Laid up with some man.

374
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,770
Oh, no.

375
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,122
Hell not! Marcy! Tee Tee!

376
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,840
- It was today?
- Damn right, it was today.

377
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,082
Y'know I was waitin'
for a line from Jackson.

378
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,083
He's in Afghan, seein' action.

379
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,844
Waitin' for his call,
I went to the mall.

380
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,127
Lil' Man wanted some Cap'n Crunch.

381
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,084
He'll eat it for breakfast
or maybe lunch.

382
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,525
Get in the damn car.

383
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,246
Whose crib this be?

384
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,604
- Indigo.
- Indigo?

385
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,361
Isn't that Cyclops' main squeeze?

386
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,686
Cyclops's bae?

387
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,931
Yo, I got dem in purple.

388
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,248
She a woman. We all black women.

389
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,010
That's the matter at hand, sister.

390
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,162
Yeah, yeah, I can dig da Sister Apps!

391
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,969
But make sure dey don't bust no caps.

392

Can I help you?

393
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,841
'Sup, Indigo?

394
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:30,084
Are you CoverGirl clean,
mad figure, brick shit house, mean!

395
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,204
This about who set your house on fire?

396
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,806
- What dese tired strags want?
- What y'all want!?

397
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,928
Chill wit da shrill,
before I whoop yo' butt, slut.

398
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,005
Are you serious? You are at my door.

399
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,003
I got a kid with me, y'all. Relax.

400
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,650
- Calm down.
- Peace, peace and hair grease.

401
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,290
- Check your girl.
- Check her.

402
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,361
Check the ignorance.

403
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,241
- We all sisters here.
- Bitch, I ain't your sister.

404
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,930
This is my runnin' partner, Dania.

405
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,570
- My ace boon koon, Hecuba.
- What?

406
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,160
And I know you know Kenya, the rapper.

407
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,851
I ain't putting out fear
so what ya tryin' to steer?

408
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,887
God Forbid, Cyclops find you
Spartan chicks up in here.

409
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,731
Everybody in here got a man
in orange and purple colors.

410
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,768
Bangin' and slangin',
fighting for a flag,

411
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,962
risking that long zip
of the cadaver bag.

412
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,889
- That's how we live.
- That's how we die.

413
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,563
You want to loose your man
to a drive-by?

414
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,762
In a pinebox before he's 25.

415
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,366
- I lost my cousin.
- And I lost my little brother.

416
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,721
I lost my nephew.

417
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,604
My uncle got killed two weeks ago.

418
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,326
And like always, nobody saw nothin'.

419
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,686
All to the bang, bang.

420
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,250
Bang, bang.

421
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,766
We've all lost people, too.
Many a sister and brother.

422
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,320
Now, I'd like to see
Cyclops and Chi put down that mess

423
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,244
between the Trojan and the Greeks,
but that day looks bleak.

424
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,125
What if we could devise a method
to end the bloodshed?

425
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,203
Yo count on me. You need money?

426
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,443
I'll pawn all the gold around my neck,
den git turned up 'till I'm a wreck!

427
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,602
I'm ready to split myself
up the middle, to give you half.

428
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,682
I'm down for the cause but how?

429
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,725
We force our men to negotiate peace

430
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,731
by exercising cocksure self control

431
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,770
and total abstinence
from knockin' the boots.

432
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,491
I never did like you Trojan
chicken heads any-goddamn-way so...

433
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,608
- Oh, hell, no.
- You got to get out of here.

434
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,762
- Y'all kickin' us out?
- Yeah, out of here.

435
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,490
- Shoot 'em up.
- Bang, bang.

436
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,329
Please, please, just sit down.

437
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,283
We ain't gonna be dat long,
Rasheeda, shut up!

438
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,525
- Give me one more minute.
- Hey, I got my son with me,

439
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,601
<i>I</i> got to go.

440
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,331
Marcy, this has to do with your son.

441
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,530
Just a minute ago, you were ready
to split yourself up the middle.

442
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,008
Go ahead so that
you Spartans can get out of here.

443
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,288
I just saw a mother weepin'
in the streets.

444
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,488
Her baby's blood spilt.

445
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,286
Man, you really think
somethin' like that could bring peace?

446
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,449
Y'all know the power we have over them
withholding with just a day.

447
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,084
A week? Imagine a month.

448
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,890
A year.

449
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,966
They are gonna bring the peace.

450
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,243
Suppose, suppose
that the men just dump us.

451
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,687
If we all hold out,
who can they go to?

452
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,120
The thots!

453
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,600
Dem hoes o'er there.

454
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,842
Well, we will enlist them too.

455
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,327
We want our men alive,
we want our babies to thrive,

456
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,170
we gonna have to organize.

457
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,681
Repeat after me.

458
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:26,008
I will deny all rights of access
or entrance...

459
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,967
I will deny all rights

460
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,330
of access or entrance...

461
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,367
from every husband, lover,
or male acquaintance...

462
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:45,324
from every husband, lover,
or male acquaintance...

463
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,962
who comes to my direction,
in-erection...

464
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,883
who comes to my direction,
in-erection...

465
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,884
Come on, say it.

466
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,608
Girl, can't cheat us.

467
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,968
I can't do this. No.

468
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:06,250
If he should force me to lay
on that conjugal couch...

469
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:11,721
if he should force me to lay
on that conjugal couch...

470
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:17,251
I will refuse his strokin',
not give up that nappy pouch.

471
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,407
I will refuse his stroke,
not give up that nappy pouch.

472
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,922
- No peace...
- No pussy.

473
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,291
The red wine has been drunk,
the plan has now struck.

474
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,851
Dolmedes must tell you fellas,
y'all about to get punked.

475
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,763
Lysistrata had them all
take a solemn oath,

476
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,967
"Stop the murder madness,
or there would be no more pokes.”."

477
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,086
Some even thought the shit was hoax.

478
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,081
How could dem females give up
long dick and da down stroke?

479
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,602
This must be some bullshit.

480
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,405
Ain't no fucking way.

481
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,609
But y'all about to find out

482
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,805
these gals don't play.

483
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,968
No more punane, nookiepie,
beehive or honeybun.

484
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,370
No coochie, no nappy dugout.
That's right.

485
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,001
You get none.

486
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,921
Say what?

487
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,080
CHI-RAQ: To be so smart,
y'know you're tweakin' right?

488
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,283
You Lame as Hell, playin' games for
real wit' dis whack-ass panty strike.

489
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,885
And that's the shit we don't like.

490
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,121
You want to choose to be ruled,

491
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,168
bitches gonna be tight
when you make they lose their dudes.

492
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,009
I dunno who you think
you're tryin' to change.

493
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,050
I'm Trojan through and through,
that's stronger than any damn screw.

494
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,360
It' even bigger than you.

495
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,523
All you care about
is this tired gangster game.

496
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,411
Well, it's lame.

497
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,249
You think you'll die with fame?

498
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,882
Negro, two days later
no one will even remember your name.

499
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,568
Your machismo's really masochism.
That's why we cuttin' off da jism!

500
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,882
As long as you love the life
more than a wife,

501
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,121
we strike.

502
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,806
Why you so frigid?

503
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,009
Baby, let me thaw you out
with this ice-pick.

504
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,204
Know you can't resist
the chocolate lick.

505
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,047
Chill out.

506
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,329
This next move is the best move
and it's gonna be smooth...

507
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,562
Fine. Remember that
little Kiddie Rhyme.

508
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,529
Three, Six, Nine, Indigo Drank Wine.

509
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,489
Made her Chicks walk this No Sex Line.

510
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,483
But the Line Broke!
Them Bitches Choked!

511
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,642
And Lysistrata
and her "Former" "Friends"

512
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,888
got replaced by some tighter pokes.

513
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,527
Bye.

514
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,361
- Be...
- Safe.

515
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,089
What's happenin'
with the jump off bacchos?

516
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,810
We got the cheese, where's the nachos?

517
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,644

And no, it doesn't look good...

693
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,482
Not when Patti was lost
on a busy street,

694
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,608
with folks going to work and school,

695
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,523

How is it possible that not one
witness has come forward?

697
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,923
- Not one!
- How is it possible

698
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,642
that no one has the courage
and the conscience to speak up

699
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,446

Cynics say,
"Well if I snitch I'll be killed too."

702
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,486
First of all,
when a murderer walks free,

703
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,403
we are all in danger.

704
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,482
But if multiple folks come forward,

705
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,921
multiple folks who
witnessed these murders

706
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,849
there is no one target.

707
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,322
What makes someone
a target is not the shooter.

708
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,482
What makes someone
a target is the community

709
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,688
that surrenders to fear.

710
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,090
And becomes silent!

711
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,929
That's why we at St. Sabina

712
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:40,525
must put out a $5,000 reward
for information

713

of Patti's killer.

01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:51,371
back when we lived in
The Cabrini Green Projects,

1705
01:52:52,240 --> 01:52:53,890
Pam was outside...

1706
01:52:54,440 --> 01:52:57,649
jumping double dutch
when they started shooting.

1707
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:01,286
She was shot through her left eye

1708
01:53:02,440 --> 01:53:04,329
by a stray bullet.

1709
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:07,327
This was over twenty years ago

1710
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:10,808
and children dying from stray bullets

1711
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:14,169
wasn't a common occurrence like it is
today.

1712
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:20,010
Days later a young man
came to my apartment.

1713
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:22,680
He begged my forgiveness,

1714
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:26,843
then he confessed to the police.

1715
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:29,929
Back then,

1716
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:33,408
it was a violation of the gang code

1717
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:35,967
to murder children.

1718
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:41,091
He knew...

1719
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:44,165
He knew

1720
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:47,088
that if he didn't confess
to me and the police

1721
01:53:47,160 --> 01:53:48,525
that the gangs

1722
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:50,850
would end his life.

1723
01:53:53,400 --> 01:53:55,243
And that man was your father.

1724
01:53:57,680 --> 01:53:58,841
Jamel.

1725
01:54:10,720 --> 01:54:12,449
Never knew him.

1726
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:16,722
Only heard stories.

1727
01:54:18,160 --> 01:54:20,561
He got killed in prison
when I was just a shorty.

1728
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:23,847
He tried to be a good man.

1729
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:27,771
You can be a good man.

1730
01:54:35,160 --> 01:54:37,003
Be a good man.

1731
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:43,609
Be a good man...

1732
01:54:47,240 --> 01:54:48,969
Be a good man...

1733
01:54:51,480 --> 01:54:52,891
Be a good man...

1734
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,411
Be a good man...

1735
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:02,043
Be a good man...

1736
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:21,280
I did dirt.

1737
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:24,731

1740
01:55:54,120 --> 01:55:55,610
It was an accident.

1741
01:55:55,960 --> 01:55:57,166
No!

Time for you to do the same.

1746

Take the blame. Take the claim.

1747
01:56:36,680 --> 01:56:38,762
Take it on the chin
and confess your sin.

1748
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:42,246
Be a man and quit trying to suppress
this pain you in.

1749
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:44,807
Hell of a mess this gang you in.

1750
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:46,960
Sleepless nights!

1751
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:50,207
Too weak to fight,
couldn't reach us to teach us right.

our dying brothers.

that's what they want us to be,

1754
01:56:55,160 --> 01:56:56,241
Deaf and dumb.

1755
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:59,326
But you see, the only ones we
protecting is the gun.

1756
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:02,331
So run, nigga, run,
I let it run outta me.

1757
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:04,962
Cause I'm finally free from all these
demons.

1758
01:57:05,480 --> 01:57:08,051
Finally I'm leaving!
Finally I'm breathing!

1759
01:57:08,440 --> 01:57:10,408
So bring the truth! Bring the truth!

1760
01:57:11,080 --> 01:57:14,050
Bring the truth, brother! Bring it!

1761
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:27,450
He'll be all right.
Chi-Raq can take care of himself.

1762
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:30,084
That's Demetrius.

I ain't too sure about that
but for now,

1770
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:02,730
I'll say yeah!

1771
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:07,010
Lysistrata formed an army more
powerful than the Roman Empire.

Burned through the city,

1773
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:11,409
just like that Chicago fire.

1774
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:15,169
So remember,
Queen Prophet, Lysistrata.

1775
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:19,404
And the lessons that she taught you.
