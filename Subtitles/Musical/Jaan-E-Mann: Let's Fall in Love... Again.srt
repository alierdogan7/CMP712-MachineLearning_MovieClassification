1
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,403
Agastya! Do you remember
what day is today?

2
00:02:44,981 --> 00:02:47,916
So farfrom Earth.
What difference does that make?

3
00:02:48,117 --> 00:02:49,516
whether it Monday or Friday...

4
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:51,452
every day is the same to us.

5
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:56,354
No stupid! Remember, exactly an year ago,

6
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,489
we left on this mission on 25th August.

7
00:03:02,232 --> 00:03:04,291
25th August! Oh my God!

8
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,364
What happened?

9
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,067
l forgot to call my friend, Suhan.

10
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,701
Today is his birthday.

11
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:12,105
Suhan?

12
00:03:12,475 --> 00:03:14,204
Yeah! He is an old friend of mine.

13
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:15,801
From Houston?

14
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:18,105
No. From Mumbai, lndia.

15
00:03:18,414 --> 00:03:20,974
From lndia? -Yeah.

16
00:03:22,018 --> 00:03:23,986
Well, what exactly are you trying to do..

17
00:03:24,187 --> 00:03:26,917
..calling someone in lndia
at 5 in the morning?

18
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:33,559
That's true.

19
00:03:34,831 --> 00:03:37,493
Well. Now that you have a
couple of hours before..

20
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,295
..you call him, why don't you tell me
about yourfriend, Suhan?

21
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:45,338
Well. Where do l start from?

22
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:51,206
Suhan. Let me start before l met him.

23
00:05:04,587 --> 00:05:07,579

24
00:05:15,798 --> 00:05:16,992

Actually the only person who's really,
really important to me.

34

l'd like to thank my little..

35
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,792

45
00:06:15,758 --> 00:06:16,656
Sorry guys.

46
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,994
l was saying my little uncle and..

47
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:22,461
Excuse me.

48
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:24,055
This is embarrassing.

49
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:28,701
Uncle. Uncle l was just talking about you.

50
00:06:29,172 --> 00:06:30,639
Uncle will you call me in two minutes?

51
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,034

are you still dreaming?

53
00:06:35,545 --> 00:06:36,569
Uncle.

54
00:06:38,748 --> 00:06:39,510
Dream?

55
00:06:45,888 --> 00:06:46,684
Yes, uncle.

56
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:48,516

00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,153

00:06:52,628 --> 00:06:53,856
Uncle, l'll just come.

59
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:02,438
Suhan! My hero! My superstar!

60
00:07:02,638 --> 00:07:05,163
Uncle, basket.

61
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,974
Uncle, what is the trouble?

62
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,771
That you woke me up early in the morning.

63
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:13,541
You are right.

64
00:07:17,053 --> 00:07:18,782
Give it to me. Sorry! Sorry!

65
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:20,046
What were you trying to do?

66
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:22,417
Sorry, uncle. l was trying to help you.
l won't do it.

67
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,025
You want to help me
because l am a dwarf.

68
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:27,753
No, uncle! Tell me from where
do you look like a dwarf?

69
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,225
Exactly. You are my real friend.

70
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:31,024
l know.

71
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:34,731
Are you the new assistant?

72
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:36,097
Yes, sir. Pandey.

73
00:07:37,073 --> 00:07:41,635
Mr. Pandey, henceforth knock
before entering my office.

74
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:43,344
Sorry, Bonny sir.

75
00:07:44,313 --> 00:07:46,247
What did you say? - Bonny sir.

76
00:07:47,283 --> 00:07:50,446
lt's not Bonny sir. lt's Bonney!

77
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:52,177
l don't know why my parents kept
my name such..

78
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:53,912
..that it suits my personality.

79
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:56,921
Bonny! - Bonney!

80
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,023
Bo.. - Okay. You can call me sir.

81
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,252
Okay, sir. Sir!

82
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:02,721
Don't you sit down! Stand up! Stand up!

83
00:08:02,932 --> 00:08:04,729
Don't ever sit down in front of me. Okay. - Sir.

84
00:08:04,934 --> 00:08:06,959
Yeah. - Sir, this is the bona fide certificate.

85
00:08:08,304 --> 00:08:10,864
What certificate?
- Sir, bona fide certificate.

86
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:14,042
lt's not bona fide.
lt's bonafide certificate.

87
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,268
Even l can see that.
But what are these for?

88
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,605
Mr. Bawarchee.

89
00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:26,913
Mr. Pandey.. are you doing this deliberately?

90
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:28,454
What, sir?

91
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,486
Because you know that l..

92
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:32,351
Sir, you what?

93
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:35,963
Because l am.. because l am.. -You?

94
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:37,257
Because l am a dwarf.

95
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,025
Sir, how can you even imagine this!

96
00:08:40,236 --> 00:08:40,793
Sir, l can't even imagine this!

97
00:08:41,003 --> 00:08:44,530
Okay! Okay! Relax! Don't get emotional.

98
00:08:50,246 --> 00:08:51,474
Bonney Singh. Okay.

99
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:53,978
Thank you, sir.

100
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:56,709
Sir..

101
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,780
Yes, Mr. Pandey.

102
00:08:59,021 --> 00:09:00,613
Sir, today l need a half-day leave.

103
00:09:00,823 --> 00:09:03,951
Of course! Of course!
Why do you need a leave?

104
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,890
Sir, my car has broken down.
lts bonnet has broken.

105
00:09:09,865 --> 00:09:13,232
Bonnet? Get out! Get out!

106
00:09:18,107 --> 00:09:20,268
No need to hide your laughter, dear.

107
00:09:20,543 --> 00:09:22,238
Very soon these tears of happiness..

108
00:09:22,445 --> 00:09:24,675
..are going to be converted
into tears of sorrow.

109
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:26,075
No!

110
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:31,080
A notice had come today in the morning.

111
00:09:35,057 --> 00:09:36,285
Of Piya's lawyer.

112
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:42,288
Ayear ago Mr. Suhan Kapoor and
Ms. Piya Goyal had divorced.

113
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:46,434
The court had declared that
every month on the 1st..

114
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:49,469
..the husband Suhan Kapoor
will send a cheque of 25,000..

115
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:54,405
..as alimony to his wife Piya Goyal.

116
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,545
But even after a year Suhan Kapoor..

117
00:09:57,747 --> 00:10:02,013
..has not sent even a single cheque of
alimony to Piya Goyal.

118
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:05,349
Because of Suhan Kapoor's
carelessness Piya Goyal..

119
00:10:05,554 --> 00:10:09,786
..had to undergo tremendous financial,
physical and mental stress.

120
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:13,052
Because it has been proved
that Piya Goyal..

121
00:10:13,262 --> 00:10:16,720
..can't depend on Suhan Kapoor every month..

122
00:10:16,932 --> 00:10:21,494
..so Piya Goyal demands
a one time settlement..

123
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:26,368
..of 50 lakhs as an alimony
from Suhan Kapoor.

124
00:10:28,344 --> 00:10:30,039
50 lakhs!

125
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:34,509
You have one month's time to
repay the settlement amount.

126
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,749
Suhan! Suhan! Suhan!

127
00:10:42,692 --> 00:10:43,317
Catch the ball!

128
00:11:00,776 --> 00:11:01,435
Uncle!

129
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,940
l had heard that poison is
used to treat poison.

130
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:07,613
But shock is used to treat shock..

131
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:09,114
..l am seeing it forthe first time.

132
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:12,446
50 lakhs! Uncle,
from where will l get 50 lakhs?

133
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:14,418
l don't have enough money to even pay..

134
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:15,214
..the telephone and electricity bill.

135
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,221
l have not paid my house rent
forthe past 3 months.

136
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,916
This has no connection with the law.

137
00:11:19,128 --> 00:11:20,459
Law had decided the amount.

138
00:11:20,663 --> 00:11:22,563
And you have not paid
a single penny to Piya.

139
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,859
But uncle, Piya doesn't need money.

140
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:28,434
l don't have work.
She should be giving me the alimony.

141
00:11:28,637 --> 00:11:31,105
But when you got divorced,
at that time you had work..

142
00:11:31,307 --> 00:11:32,274
..and Piya had no work.

143
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:33,999
Correct! Correct!

144
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,740
But now the tables have turned.

145
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,470
She has work.
That too in New York.

146
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:41,479
She is earning in dollars.
Uncle, l have no work.

147
00:11:41,684 --> 00:11:44,744
So we have to go to the court
and re-evaluate this case.

148
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,855
And you will have to get me
the alimony. Correct.

149
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,250
Really? How much?

150
00:11:49,592 --> 00:11:51,150
l think 50,000 per month is fine.

151
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,987
50,000! l will strangulate you!

152
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:54,492
Why? You didn't like my idea?

153
00:11:54,697 --> 00:11:57,165
Not at all! At least some time
take your work seriously.

154
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,763
This is a court case.

155
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,163
You have not given a single penny..

156
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,701
..to Piya in the past one-year as alimony.

157
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:04,668
lf you will go to the court,
then you yourself will get stuck.

158
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,444
Uncle, what should l do? l don't get any work.

159
00:12:09,945 --> 00:12:11,105
Whatever money l had, l spent that..

160
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,281
..on bodybuilding and photo session.

161
00:12:13,716 --> 00:12:15,274
Where will l get 50 lakhs?

162
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,145
Dear, you will have to arrange
forthe money.

163
00:12:17,353 --> 00:12:19,548
Otherwise you will have
to rot in the prison.

164
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:24,120
l will not go to the prison.

165
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,160
lf l went to prison..
then my dream of becoming..

166
00:12:28,364 --> 00:12:30,491
..a super star will be completely shattered.

167
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:32,963
l will somehow survive. But you won't.

168
00:12:33,202 --> 00:12:36,000
l will think of a brilliant idea.

169
00:12:37,473 --> 00:12:38,735
l could have never imagined!

170
00:12:38,941 --> 00:12:41,603
l could have never imagined that
Piya would behave like this!

171
00:12:42,411 --> 00:12:43,378
l don't know what have l done that..

172
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:44,273
..she is taking revenge from me!

173
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:46,712
She wants to send me to prison.

174
00:12:47,082 --> 00:12:48,379
What is this?

175
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:49,380
l am showing you the flashback.

176
00:12:49,585 --> 00:12:51,678
So that you will get a rough idea about my life.

177
00:12:51,921 --> 00:12:55,755
People who live for love they are lucky.

178

People who die for love they too are strange.

My saga is precious. Beloved.

180
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:09,229

turn out to be like this?

She looked so innocent.

the norm of the society.''

Your story is very sad.
lt is very emotional.

Even today l don't understand
why she did this to me.

She ditched me at the time
when l needed herthe most.

Women are like this.
You can nevertrust women.

lf you have wealth and fame,
then women will hover around you.

And when you are in trouble,
they will leave you in a lurch.

Friend, you don't worry about that.

You don't worry about that.

272
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,877
Because the one who has given hunger..

273
00:23:56,751 --> 00:23:58,013
..He will provide you with food too.

274
00:23:58,587 --> 00:23:59,781
Because the one who has given thirst..

...He will provide you with alcohol too.

276
00:24:01,756 --> 00:24:03,553
And the one who has given alcohol,
he will give snacks too.

00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:05,919
The one who has given the trouble,
he will solve it too.

278
00:24:06,128 --> 00:24:07,527
We will surely find a scapegoat..

279
00:24:07,729 --> 00:24:09,993
..from whom we will get 50 lakhs.

280
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,130
What scapegoat, uncle?

281
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:14,894
What scapegoat?
A scapegoat that has 50 lakhs.

282
00:24:15,303 --> 00:24:19,069
Afoolish man who is willing
to give us 50 lakhs.

283
00:24:19,274 --> 00:24:21,640
Afool who will dance to ourtunes.

284

Afool who will listen to
everything that we say.

285

An idiot who will do whatever we say.

286

such a foolish and idiot person?

This house doesn't belong to my father.

l am a tenant. And forthe last 3 months,
l have not paid the rent.

291
00:24:51,806 --> 00:24:53,239
How much will you get foryour old car?

292
00:24:53,441 --> 00:24:55,409
l already sold it 3 months back for 50 lakhs.

293
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:56,577
You can't sell your house and car.

294
00:24:56,778 --> 00:24:58,268
Do you have something to sell?

295
00:25:01,283 --> 00:25:02,341
Uncle. -Yes.

296
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:05,952
How much will l get for my kidney?

Don't talk rubbish.

l don't say this. lt is written in the books.

Now only God can save us.

301
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,473
Let's ask God's help.

302
00:25:28,677 --> 00:25:29,644
Help.

304
00:25:33,415 --> 00:25:37,146
We don't have any other option.

305

First time l'm asking you something.

306
00:25:40,422 --> 00:25:41,514
No other way too.

307
00:25:41,723 --> 00:25:46,217

solve all our problems.

-What are you looking for?

Piya. - Piya?

314
00:26:19,561 --> 00:26:21,392
Piya does not stay here.

She does not stay here.
She has been divorced.

Divorce.

320
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,579
Piya cannot go away like this.

321
00:26:44,052 --> 00:26:45,883
How can Piya be compared to that guy?

322
00:26:46,655 --> 00:26:49,954
Piya is anangel and that
man is a bloody animal.

323
00:26:50,325 --> 00:26:52,452
lt's all my mistake,
l shouldn't have let her go.

00:28:40,668 --> 00:28:42,192
Super Star!

356
00:28:42,404 --> 00:28:45,965
This means you are the new owners
of this house. - Oh yes.

357
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:50,168
But the way you are asking questions to me..

358
00:28:50,378 --> 00:28:52,642
..as if you know Piya very well.

359
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:54,474
As if you are her relatives, could be a brother

360
00:28:54,682 --> 00:28:59,483
From yourtalks it looks like
you know Piya's family very well.

361
00:28:59,687 --> 00:29:01,279
Yes. - ls it? - How?

362
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:05,949
No, l don't know Piya's family,
but l know Piya very well.

363
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,822
She was my girl friend. -What?

364
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:09,155
Yes, she was my sweet heart?

365
00:29:09,364 --> 00:29:13,664
But, Piya's marriage was going
to be with some one else..

366
00:29:14,469 --> 00:29:18,098
What did l tell you?
She was surely my girl friend..

367
00:29:18,473 --> 00:29:19,838
..but l was not her boy friend. - Oh!

368
00:29:24,312 --> 00:29:27,304
Actually, Piya was surely going to marry me.

369
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:32,415
But then she married that bull.

370
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,823
Have you seen him?
He looked like King Kong.

371
00:29:36,491 --> 00:29:40,018
l had already said that
Piya can't be happy with that Gorilla.

372
00:29:40,829 --> 00:29:44,094
She was a delicate doll,
and the guy was a hairy bear!

373
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:46,859
But you did not tell,
how did you know her?

374
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,063
How did l know?

375
00:29:54,175 --> 00:29:56,268
Actually we studied together.

376
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:01,374
She was the love of my life,
my sweet heart.

377
00:30:03,184 --> 00:30:04,082
Who's snap is this?

378
00:30:06,754 --> 00:30:07,948
This is me and Piya.

379
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,449
That is the only one copy with me.

380
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:12,751
Keep it carefully.

381
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,525
That was the last time l saw Piya.

382
00:30:19,968 --> 00:30:21,401
She was very happy.

383
00:30:23,104 --> 00:30:27,973
l don't know how she would be now.

384
00:30:28,943 --> 00:30:30,968
No son, don't say like that.

385
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,247
You were saying how Piya was
going to marry you.

386
00:30:38,152 --> 00:30:46,617
Yes. lt is a long story.
lt will take lots of time.

387
00:30:46,828 --> 00:30:49,126
You don't worry about time.
We have enough.

388
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,490
What do you say? -Yes.

389
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:52,865
l still remember vividly...

390
00:30:54,168 --> 00:30:55,567
My first day in college.

391
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:06,436
E = mc2. l don't know
how that genius cracked it.

392
00:31:06,648 --> 00:31:12,780
Amazing. Einstein, genius.
What's the time?

393
00:31:12,987 --> 00:31:14,420
Ok, ok. l am going. Bye, bye.

394
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,728
Ouch! Hey!

395
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:43,139
Sorry..

396
00:32:14,749 --> 00:32:16,614
Love at first sight.

397
00:32:17,452 --> 00:32:20,478
l remember. The first day of the college.

398
00:32:28,796 --> 00:32:29,820
My foot!

399
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:39,403
What happened, then?

400
00:32:40,775 --> 00:32:44,108
Days passed away,
we started coming closer..

401
00:32:44,445 --> 00:32:46,208
Me and Piya were like one.

402
00:32:46,781 --> 00:32:52,742
Whatever class, chemistry,
physics.. we sat together.

403
00:32:53,921 --> 00:32:54,819
Then, one day..

404
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,483
'Find your last years forms'

405
00:33:07,802 --> 00:33:08,894
Sure, sure. Sure.

406
00:33:12,306 --> 00:33:15,742
Excuse me. Excuse me.

407
00:33:17,011 --> 00:33:18,342
Who are you? What do you want?

408
00:33:19,047 --> 00:33:22,813
Me, Agastya Roy. Your neighbor.
Always stay next to you.

409
00:33:23,017 --> 00:33:25,178
Really? l never saw you before?

410
00:33:25,953 --> 00:33:28,217
But l have seen you always. -What?

411
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:32,359
Your sister. She's calling you.
She's waiting outside.

412
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:42,870
Come here. Please pass my message..
- No. No.

413
00:33:48,509 --> 00:33:52,673
Please.. - Ok, Ok.

414
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,144
Sir. l have one question, sir. -Yes?

415
00:34:04,092 --> 00:34:05,650
Very good question, Agastya.

416
00:34:10,098 --> 00:34:11,326
Go, go. Go.

417
00:34:12,366 --> 00:34:16,166
Yeah, come in. You dropped your book.

418
00:34:17,205 --> 00:34:20,572
Agastya! What are you doing?

419
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,283
lt was the first time l remember.

420
00:34:33,621 --> 00:34:36,852
l mean.. l had sacrificed for Piya.

421
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:55,899
l'm performing in your
college tomorrow night.

422
00:34:57,979 --> 00:34:59,879
Who will you come with?

423
00:35:01,382 --> 00:35:02,815
Somebody has to accompany me.

424
00:35:04,118 --> 00:35:07,610
You know l've psychological problem,
l can't see you with any other man.

425
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:09,481
Suhan, please, buddy.

426
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,681
Your concert, and how can l go alone?

427
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,356
Don't get jealousy. Okay listen to me.

428

429

Come with him.

430
00:35:31,112 --> 00:35:33,672
You've already floored too many here.

431
00:35:33,915 --> 00:35:38,215
l don't expect trouble from this idiot.

432
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,053
Ok. Ok. - Sorry.

433
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,657
Even today when l think of that day..

434
00:35:48,029 --> 00:35:50,520
..my ears start ringing.

435
00:35:51,966 --> 00:35:53,934
My sacrifice didn't got wasted.

436
00:35:54,969 --> 00:35:58,769
l was sitting alone on the steps and thinking..

437
00:35:58,973 --> 00:36:03,603
Hi Champu. Oh my god! Are you crying?

438
00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:08,214
No. There was something in my eye.

439
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,615
Take this. -What's this?

440
00:36:10,818 --> 00:36:12,877
l am sorry, it was because of me.

441
00:36:15,189 --> 00:36:19,216
No. Not because of you. Don't be sorry.

442
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,918
You are a friend. And in friendship,
you never say::

443
00:36:22,129 --> 00:36:25,963
..sorry orthank you.
Friends are friends. Ok?

444
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:28,567
Oh Champu, you are so sweet.

445
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:33,031
Don't cry. Ok, listen.

446
00:36:33,507 --> 00:36:37,841
Will you come to the rock-show
along with me as my date?

447
00:36:45,186 --> 00:36:45,811

448
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,180
l would love to come.

449
00:36:49,523 --> 00:36:50,080
Champu, you are late.

450
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,418
Sorry, l had gone to buy a new suit.

451
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,116
How do l look?

452
00:36:53,327 --> 00:36:55,454
Wow! -At least look at it once.

''A O. -A. O.''

458
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,551
''Louder!''

466

''Then why am l flying?''

''Then why am l flying?''

bT

490
00:41:54,962 --> 00:41:56,827
After listening to such a sad story..

491
00:41:57,498 --> 00:41:59,864
..my eyes water, and my throat is dry.

492
00:42:00,901 --> 00:42:02,698
l will go and get tea.

493
00:42:04,138 --> 00:42:07,972
Shall l get some thing foryou, Champu?
l am sorry.

494
00:42:08,842 --> 00:42:10,901
l entered your character.

495
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,474
Shall l get something foryou, Agastya?

496
00:42:13,881 --> 00:42:17,282
Yeah, l will just have a.. Bourn vita.

497
00:42:17,585 --> 00:42:21,453
lts not Bourn and then Vita.
lt's Bournvita. Ok?

498
00:42:21,889 --> 00:42:23,982
Come. Follow me.

499
00:42:28,596 --> 00:42:31,531
What are you looking for?
Recipe for vita? - Shut up!

500
00:42:34,001 --> 00:42:34,933
Found it!

501
00:42:40,874 --> 00:42:42,136
What did you find uncle, 5 millions?

502
00:42:42,343 --> 00:42:46,109
l did not find 5 million rupees,
but an idea to obtain it.

503
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:56,985
Now listen carefully. Section 25,
Under Hindu Marriage Act.

504
00:42:57,458 --> 00:42:59,858
After divorce, a husband has to take care..

505
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:04,190
..of his wife's expenses,
unless she is married again.

506
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:07,930
Once your Ex-wife remarries..

507
00:43:08,135 --> 00:43:11,195
..then her responsibility
passes to the second husband.

508
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:16,201
And you.. need not give money
towards expenses.

509
00:43:24,818 --> 00:43:26,479
This means if Piya gets married to Champu..

510
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:27,949
..then we will get 5 million rupees?

511
00:43:29,256 --> 00:43:31,986
Ok. This time nothing should go wrong.

512
00:43:32,893 --> 00:43:39,321
As you wish. l am doing it foryou,
as being yourfriend and lawyer.

513
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:40,864
l was doing my duty.

514
00:43:41,402 --> 00:43:42,664
Now it is your wish.

515
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:53,240
There is no loss, uncle? - No.

516
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,684
So.. what do you say?

517
00:44:00,587 --> 00:44:02,020
As you wish.

518
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:09,228
l was thinking, we wont find a
better suitorfor our Piya.

519
00:44:10,264 --> 00:44:13,028
So we should find a auspicious time..

520
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:15,565
..and get both of them married.

521
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,095
Even l was thinking the same.

522
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:21,300
You look, how things work out.

523
00:44:27,715 --> 00:44:31,207
Take son. Bournvita foryou. - Thank you.

524
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,215
So son, what have you thought?

525
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,854
What will you do in life?

526
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:39,220
Nothing uncle. l'm thinking
of going back home.

527
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,054
But you know, l'm worried about Piya.
-You should be.

528
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:43,661
l don't know what condition she might be in.

529
00:44:44,531 --> 00:44:48,228
Look son, whatever happens in life is for good.

530
00:44:48,902 --> 00:44:51,894
Had everything been alright in Piya's life..

531
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:55,371
..then today you would be having
Bournvita with her husband.

532
00:44:55,576 --> 00:44:57,874
You wouldn't be having Bournvita
standing here with him and me.

533
00:44:58,078 --> 00:45:00,137
You wouldn't be having Bournvita.

534
00:45:00,347 --> 00:45:01,871
What? - He hasn't got it.

535
00:45:02,082 --> 00:45:03,014
He hasn't got it.

536
00:45:03,217 --> 00:45:07,381
Son, you are having Bournvita with us here..

537
00:45:07,588 --> 00:45:10,386
..because Piya has been separated
from her husband.

538
00:45:10,591 --> 00:45:12,149
He still hasn't got it.

539
00:45:12,393 --> 00:45:13,587
One second uncle.

540
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,191
Are you telling me about
Piya or Bournvita?

541
00:45:16,397 --> 00:45:18,331
Hey shut up, shut up.

542
00:45:18,532 --> 00:45:19,658
You haven't got it, l'll explain to you.

543
00:45:19,867 --> 00:45:23,268
You.. l'll tell you.

544
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,664
Piya has been divorced.

545
00:45:24,872 --> 00:45:25,839
Has been divorced. -Yeah.

546
00:45:26,373 --> 00:45:28,568
That means she doesn't stay
with her husband.

547
00:45:28,776 --> 00:45:30,471
That means she is alone once again.

548
00:45:30,677 --> 00:45:34,579
You have come here after 7 years,
crossing the seven seas, why?

549
00:45:35,516 --> 00:45:36,175
To have Bournvita.

550
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:39,216
You haven't come for Bournvita!

551
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:42,753
You have come because
you are destined to be with Piya..

552
00:45:42,956 --> 00:45:44,617
..and Piya is destined to be with you.

553
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:47,385
You are made for each other.

554
00:45:47,594 --> 00:45:49,221
Made for each other. -Yeah.

555
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:50,827
Really? -Yes.

556
00:45:51,031 --> 00:45:58,369
Yes. She is only yours, only yours.
- Only yours. - She's mine?

557
00:45:58,572 --> 00:45:59,869
Yeah, she's yours.

558
00:46:00,073 --> 00:46:02,303
Your name is written on her.

559
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:03,407
Otherwise why would she have divorced?

560
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:06,943
Why? -Why would you come here
after 7 years? -Why?

561
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:08,872
Yeah man, that makes sense.

562
00:46:09,082 --> 00:46:10,549
Of course, that makes sense.

563
00:46:10,751 --> 00:46:12,514
Then why are you here having
Bournvita with us?

564
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:17,554
Why? - Here is her address, that she had sent
forforwarding her letters etc.

565
00:46:17,758 --> 00:46:24,163
Take a flight to New York and after 22 hours,
Piya will be in your arms.

566
00:46:30,938 --> 00:46:32,337
One second. But..

What will l do there?

568
00:46:34,608 --> 00:46:35,734
Do we have to explain to you?

569
00:46:35,943 --> 00:46:37,376
Yes you will. -Will l?

570
00:46:37,578 --> 00:46:39,876

00:55:47,327 --> 00:55:48,123
Yeah.

706
00:55:50,296 --> 00:55:52,662
lt's my luck, l was born with it.

707
00:55:52,866 --> 00:55:54,356
There's nothing one can't do.

708
00:55:55,035 --> 00:55:56,263
Cool. Cool.

709
00:55:56,469 --> 00:55:59,632
Hot chocolate sir. - Thank you.

710
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:03,570
And your apple juice.
- Thank you sweetheart.

711
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:04,971
And you know what?

712
00:56:05,178 --> 00:56:06,372
This is foryou.

713
00:56:09,682 --> 00:56:10,614
Thanks.

714
00:56:15,688 --> 00:56:17,315
l'm getting nervous thinking that when l..

715
00:56:17,524 --> 00:56:21,483
..meet Piya tomorrow,
what will become of me?

716
00:56:24,998 --> 00:56:28,934
l don't even know what
she likes or dislikes.

717
00:56:30,703 --> 00:56:32,568
l hope l don't make a fool out of myself.

718
00:56:32,772 --> 00:56:36,503
God has sent me to solve your problem.

719
00:56:36,876 --> 00:56:38,571
lf this is not a miracle then what is it?

720
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:41,340
ln the same flight,
we are both going to New York.

721
00:56:41,548 --> 00:56:43,675
And that too, not alone,
but sitting together.

722
00:56:43,883 --> 00:56:44,577
Yeah.

723
00:56:44,784 --> 00:56:47,753
l promise you.

724
00:56:49,055 --> 00:56:49,714
l'll help you out.

725
00:56:49,923 --> 00:56:52,084
Specially after hearing your
about your pining for her.

726
00:56:52,592 --> 00:56:53,354
Really?

727
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,485
l have promised uncle that, until l..

728
00:56:56,696 --> 00:57:03,693
..get you married,
l won't catch a flight back to Mumbai.

729
00:57:04,104 --> 00:57:07,699
Promise.- Our mission started like this.

730
00:57:07,907 --> 00:57:11,138
And then begun the biggest
con in the history.

731
00:57:57,123 --> 00:58:00,092
l completely surrendered myself to Suhan.

732
00:58:00,627 --> 00:58:02,322
He was my Godfather.

733
00:58:17,977 --> 00:58:21,105
Excuse me sir, can you
guide me to this address?

734
00:58:23,816 --> 00:58:25,613
The sweet little girl next door.

735
00:58:26,486 --> 00:58:27,111
Piya. -Yes.

736
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,514
My neighbor.

737
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:31,618
You've come to the right
address young man.

738
00:58:31,824 --> 00:58:32,950
She's right up there in
her apartment.

739
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,127
But why is the window closed.

740
00:58:35,328 --> 00:58:37,125
She's probably sleeping right now.

741
00:58:38,998 --> 00:58:41,466
You must be the brother
she's been talking about.

742
00:58:42,001 --> 00:58:42,797
Her brother?

743
00:58:46,339 --> 00:58:47,135
Probably.

744
00:58:47,507 --> 00:58:49,634
Nice meeting you.

745
00:58:55,181 --> 00:58:55,977
Hey guys.

746
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:10,490
''My love foryou is not new''

747
00:59:11,698 --> 00:59:16,158
''But still why...?''

748
00:59:22,875 --> 00:59:26,675
''l will make a house in front
of your house..''

749
00:59:26,879 --> 00:59:29,006
''l will make my world..''

750
00:59:30,883 --> 00:59:37,015
''ln my neighboring window,
there's a piece of moon..''

751
00:59:37,223 --> 00:59:41,353
''lt is regrettable that it is..''

752
00:59:42,562 --> 00:59:43,529
What are you looking at?

753
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:44,856
You have forgotten the
mission so soon.

754
00:59:45,064 --> 00:59:48,363
Oh yes. Piya. Show me.

755
00:59:48,901 --> 00:59:50,528
She is probably sleeping. - Okay.

756
00:59:50,803 --> 00:59:53,704
You keep watching. Call me quickly
when she wakes up.

757
01:00:14,093 --> 01:00:14,559
What happened?

758
01:00:15,495 --> 01:00:16,223
What happened?

759
01:00:17,597 --> 01:00:18,723
You were right.

760
01:00:18,931 --> 01:00:20,728
She has grown so much in 7 years.

761
01:00:22,101 --> 01:00:23,227
Behave yourself. - Sorry.

762
01:00:23,436 --> 01:00:24,562
Relax. - Sorry. - Chill. - Sorry.

763
01:00:24,771 --> 01:00:25,738
Just hold. - Right.

764
01:00:29,442 --> 01:00:30,409
Have you gone crazy?

765
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:32,077
She looks like Piya to you?

766
01:00:32,278 --> 01:00:32,903
Then who is she?

767
01:00:33,179 --> 01:00:36,910
Please. Get the number of your specs
checked Mr. Agastya Rao, okay?

768
01:00:37,116 --> 01:00:38,083
l am an lndian, not Russian.

769
01:00:38,284 --> 01:00:39,911
What?

770
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:41,245
Agastya, Agastya.

771
01:00:43,289 --> 01:00:44,085
Agastya Rao.

772
01:00:45,124 --> 01:00:45,749
Sorry.

773
01:00:56,969 --> 01:00:58,436
Can l see once, once?

774
01:01:02,308 --> 01:01:03,275
Please.

775
01:01:30,503 --> 01:01:31,299
Agastya!

776
01:01:33,005 --> 01:01:33,972
What is this?

777
01:01:37,343 --> 01:01:38,310
What is this?

778
01:01:38,511 --> 01:01:41,480
l am an astronaut and this is a telescope.

779
01:01:41,681 --> 01:01:43,148
Father of binoculars.

780
01:01:43,583 --> 01:01:44,982
Move. Let me see.

781
01:01:45,184 --> 01:01:46,310
Why are you pushing me?

782
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:48,316
Hold this.

783
01:01:49,689 --> 01:01:52,317
Amazing. - lsn't it?

784
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:53,349
Something will have to be
done about you.

785
01:02:29,228 --> 01:02:32,857
Suhan understood l can't impress Piya.

786
01:02:33,566 --> 01:02:36,694
So he changed my
personality just like him.

787
01:03:13,105 --> 01:03:19,066
l am looking just like you, right?
Rock Star. -Yeah!

788
01:03:22,949 --> 01:03:24,746
Sir, what can l get foryou?

789
01:03:24,951 --> 01:03:27,419
An apple juice and wine.
- l'll have coffee.

790
01:03:29,121 --> 01:03:30,748
Uncle! - Uncle?

791
01:03:32,625 --> 01:03:33,421
How did you come here?

792
01:03:33,793 --> 01:03:35,420
Who uncle and whose uncle.

793
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:40,928
Do you have a twin brother in lndia?
This small.

794
01:03:41,968 --> 01:03:44,937
lf l am this big then
how can my twin be this much?

795
01:03:45,137 --> 01:03:46,263
l don't have a twin brother.

796
01:03:46,472 --> 01:03:47,769
l'll ask my parents...

797
01:03:52,311 --> 01:03:55,610
Saw that. Absolutely identical.
He is uncle's carbon copy.

798
01:03:55,815 --> 01:03:58,443
How is it possible?
-Why it can't be possible?

799
01:03:58,651 --> 01:04:01,950
lt is written that there are
at least seven people in this..

800
01:04:02,154 --> 01:04:02,950
..with similarface.

801
01:04:04,156 --> 01:04:05,123
lt is all nonsense.

802
01:04:05,324 --> 01:04:07,952
No it is not nonsense.
lt is a scientifically proven thing.

803
01:04:08,327 --> 01:04:10,454
There are seven people
who look similar in this world.

804
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:12,129
And... -And?

805
01:04:13,833 --> 01:04:18,463
Just a minute. That means that
there must be seven more..

806
01:04:18,671 --> 01:04:20,138
..girls looking just like Piya.

807
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:24,139
l think l should be afterthem at least
l will get one of them. What say?

808
01:04:25,011 --> 01:04:26,979
Do you love Piya's face
or her personality?

809
01:04:27,179 --> 01:04:27,975
Both.

810
01:04:29,181 --> 01:04:31,479
Then you forget all this
nonsense and concentrate..

811
01:04:31,684 --> 01:04:33,811
..on the mission. - Ok. Tell me.

812
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:36,488
Today is the mission's first day
so we will do warm up today.

813
01:04:36,689 --> 01:04:37,656
Listen, you do exactly
what l tell you to do.

814
01:04:37,857 --> 01:04:39,654
Not a penny less or
not a penny more.

815
01:04:39,859 --> 01:04:41,156
Otherwise the whole
mission will get ruined.

816
01:04:41,527 --> 01:04:43,154
When Piya comes out of
her apartment..

817
01:04:45,364 --> 01:04:46,831
..when you look at..

818
01:04:47,033 --> 01:04:48,830
.. heryou react as if you have
seen her suddenly. - How?

819
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:52,003
Just show me once more.

820
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:55,667
Now l'll do it. Just look at me. - Ok.

821
01:04:57,777 --> 01:05:00,337
You do wonderful false acting.
You should have been in Hollywood.

822
01:05:00,546 --> 01:05:01,342
Now stop it.

823
01:05:01,547 --> 01:05:03,845
Now listen further.
When she is walking ahead you'll..

824
01:05:04,116 --> 01:05:07,517
..call her by her name.
Like this...Piya!

825
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:08,846
Piya! - Oh! My God!

826
01:05:09,055 --> 01:05:10,522
Oh! My God! -You here?

827
01:05:10,723 --> 01:05:12,190
You here? - How amazing!
- How amazing!

828
01:05:12,391 --> 01:05:13,187
She will turn back and look at you.

829
01:05:13,459 --> 01:05:14,858
Her air will fly in high speed.

830
01:05:23,235 --> 01:05:25,203
Go my lion. My blessings
are with you.

831
01:05:25,404 --> 01:05:26,530
You remember everything, right? - No.

832
01:05:27,239 --> 01:05:29,867
What? - l forget everything
when l look at Piya.

833
01:05:30,076 --> 01:05:31,202
You please come with me.

834
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:33,037
No! -Why?

835
01:05:33,412 --> 01:05:37,041
Why? Why...Why? - No, why
...why am l asking this..

836
01:05:37,249 --> 01:05:38,876
..question? l am asking you this.
Why? - Ok.

837
01:05:39,752 --> 01:05:40,878
Come on, let us go back home. Please.

838
01:05:41,087 --> 01:05:43,214
No. l'll do one thing.

839
01:05:43,422 --> 01:05:46,391
l will go with you, l will be nearyou
but l will not be with you. Ok?

840
01:05:46,592 --> 01:05:51,052
Ok. -Wait. You'll go like this to her.

841
01:05:53,933 --> 01:05:54,558
Now it is Ok. - Thank you, brother.

842
01:05:55,968 --> 01:06:02,066
Let's rock it now. - Rock it.
Rock it in and out..

843
01:06:02,441 --> 01:06:03,066
Ok. Let's go.

844
01:06:20,626 --> 01:06:22,253
Understood Champu, what you've to do?

845
01:06:28,134 --> 01:06:31,934
Hello! Yes, everything is fine...Oh! Piya!

846
01:06:33,305 --> 01:06:34,431
Go back. Start again.

847
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,268
Energy...loud...feeling...emotion...

848
01:06:37,977 --> 01:06:39,945
Take 2. Ready? Action!

849
01:06:40,479 --> 01:06:46,782
Hello! No, no, there is absolutely

850
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:49,947
Cut! Cut! Cut! What are you doing?

851
01:06:50,222 --> 01:06:53,623
Go back. Call out louder, Piya.

852
01:06:53,993 --> 01:06:55,620
Take 3. Action!

853
01:06:55,895 --> 01:06:58,955
Yes, everything l fine...Piya!

854
01:07:53,385 --> 01:07:56,013
Me...me...

855
01:08:06,398 --> 01:08:07,865
Oh! My God! Champu?!

856
01:08:19,311 --> 01:08:20,539
You have changed so much, Champu?

857
01:08:21,413 --> 01:08:27,545
Yes. -When did you come to New York?

858
01:08:29,255 --> 01:08:31,883
This morning....Today morning.

859
01:08:54,446 --> 01:08:55,743
Nice meeting you.

860
01:08:55,948 --> 01:08:57,575
Hi! Piya! - Hi!

861
01:08:59,285 --> 01:09:00,912
Zubin. Zubin Batlibhoy.

862
01:09:01,287 --> 01:09:07,089
Hi! Bye! Bye! Piya! Piya Bye! Bye!

863
01:09:07,293 --> 01:09:09,090
Where are you Piya? Bye!

864
01:09:14,633 --> 01:09:16,931
Did you see that how
Piya just went with Zubin?

865
01:09:17,136 --> 01:09:18,103
l saw. l saw everything.

866
01:09:18,804 --> 01:09:21,773
Don't worry, she'll not for him.

867
01:09:21,974 --> 01:09:23,498
But what happened to you?

868
01:09:23,709 --> 01:09:24,971
Had you applied henna on your lips?

869
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:29,777
l had told you earlierthat
the moment l see Piya something..

870
01:09:29,982 --> 01:09:30,778
..happens to me.

871
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:32,779
l think l have laid a bet
on a lame horse.

872
01:09:32,985 --> 01:09:36,443
l have a bright idea. Sorry,
l was hearing you both.

873
01:09:36,655 --> 01:09:37,622
l could not stop myself.

874
01:09:38,490 --> 01:09:41,618
This is a micro walkie-talkie.

875
01:09:41,827 --> 01:09:45,957
With this l sit here and control
my entire staff.

876
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,627
You are too much, uncle.

877
01:09:49,835 --> 01:09:53,464
When you want to stop
showing off then tell us.

878
01:09:53,672 --> 01:09:55,139
We want to take something important.

879
01:09:55,341 --> 01:09:56,638
Alright. l was just trying to help you.

880
01:09:56,842 --> 01:09:57,467
Please, don't pay attention to him.

881
01:09:57,676 --> 01:09:58,802
You tell me what you wanted to say.

882
01:09:59,178 --> 01:10:00,304
Oh! You are a good boy.

883
01:10:00,512 --> 01:10:03,811

And then what everyou want
him to do you tell him.

01:10:10,522 --> 01:10:12,649
You will keep telling him and
he will keep doing them.

887
01:10:13,359 --> 01:10:16,487
Wow! Uncle. At least
you were of some use.

01:10:18,097 --> 01:10:18,995
Thank you, very much.

890
01:10:19,365 --> 01:10:22,823
But listen, remember its range
is only 100 metres.

891
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:25,837

01:10:52,564 --> 01:10:53,360
l am just thinking this.

900
01:10:53,565 --> 01:10:56,363
After all you are going for
my work, brother. - Right.

901
01:10:57,569 --> 01:10:58,866
You are going for my work.

902

You did not recognise me? - No.

Have a look.

909
01:11:31,971 --> 01:11:33,734
That means that nobody will be
able to recognise me.

910
01:11:34,106 --> 01:11:37,234
And l will be at a distance of
100 metres from you.

911
01:11:37,443 --> 01:11:39,070
This is a book on Picasso.
- But this is an old book.

912
01:11:39,278 --> 01:11:41,906
Second hand, only then it will
appear like you've read it.

913
01:12:04,636 --> 01:12:05,933
Excuse me, Can l help you?

Champu sounds sexy.

916
01:12:15,647 --> 01:12:17,444
But how come you are here?

917
01:12:19,651 --> 01:12:22,620

You know these flowers.

Oh! What?

When you see me...

929
01:12:49,348 --> 01:12:51,145
You feel l don't go well with flowers.

930
01:12:51,350 --> 01:12:53,818
Never judge anyone with appearance.

931
01:12:54,019 --> 01:12:56,317
You are the flower Halycon.

932
01:12:56,522 --> 01:13:01,482

..interested in flowers.

937
01:13:13,539 --> 01:13:16,007
Listen l do not believe in this
boy-girl thing.

938
01:13:16,375 --> 01:13:18,172
l do not believe in boy-girl thing.

939
01:13:18,377 --> 01:13:19,503

940
01:13:19,711 --> 01:13:20,837
l am a homosexual.

941
01:13:21,046 --> 01:13:23,844
Oh Shit! Don't say that.

942
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:26,518
You say, l am a heterosexual.

943
01:13:26,718 --> 01:13:28,515
Heterosexual.

944
01:13:30,722 --> 01:13:32,189
Oops! - Oops!

945
01:13:34,726 --> 01:13:36,193

l like Picasso? l love Picasso.
Picasso is in my blood.

947
01:13:41,233 --> 01:13:42,700
But how did you know? Oh!

948
01:13:46,238 --> 01:13:47,705
Sharp observation.

949
01:13:49,908 --> 01:13:52,706
l have read Picasso fourtimes.

950
01:13:53,912 --> 01:13:57,040
You know what is the best thing
about Picasso? -What?

951
01:13:57,916 --> 01:13:58,541
Boss!

952
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:06,717
So, you were telling me
something about Picasso.

953
01:14:07,593 --> 01:14:11,893
Oh! Yes, Picasso. Picasso....

954
01:14:13,332 --> 01:14:15,061
Who are you? -Zorro.

955
01:14:15,267 --> 01:14:17,565
Zorro? Then become invisible
and show me.

956
01:14:21,607 --> 01:14:23,734
You really want to know
about Picasso?

957
01:14:24,009 --> 01:14:26,910
You are a fraud. Fraud!
You do this and show me.

958
01:14:34,686 --> 01:14:36,085
How could you that Zubin?

959
01:14:36,288 --> 01:14:37,414
No, l didn't do anything.

960
01:14:37,689 --> 01:14:41,921
Zorro, it was him outside your boutique.
You guys can't believe it.

961
01:14:50,302 --> 01:14:52,770
l am too glad that you've
come to our Casino.

962
01:14:53,138 --> 01:14:56,596
l had done all the arrangements
forthe Fresh food.

963
01:14:56,808 --> 01:14:58,275
But suddenly how come
you are in a mood of having..

964
01:14:58,477 --> 01:14:59,273
..ltalian food.

965
01:14:59,478 --> 01:15:00,775
You like ltalian?

966
01:15:00,979 --> 01:15:05,939
l like ltalian? l love ltalian.
ltalian is in my blood.

967
01:15:06,318 --> 01:15:10,277
Suhan never got an opportunity
to wear diffrent get ups.

968
01:15:10,489 --> 01:15:14,448
So he used this opportunity to
wear different costumes.

969
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:17,356
Always came in a different costume.
And he was funny.

970
01:15:23,335 --> 01:15:24,802
l'll have one Vinaigrette.

971
01:15:25,070 --> 01:15:26,970
l'll have the same. Thanks.

972
01:15:27,339 --> 01:15:28,806
And l'll have a diet coke.

973
01:15:29,675 --> 01:15:33,304
Just diet coke. Come on, Zubin.
Order something.

974
01:15:34,012 --> 01:15:35,639
No. l hate ltalian food.

975
01:15:35,847 --> 01:15:37,144
Specially spicy food.

976
01:15:37,516 --> 01:15:38,813
You don't like spicy food?

977
01:15:39,017 --> 01:15:40,484
You don't like spicy food? - No.

978
01:15:40,686 --> 01:15:41,482
You like spicy food.

979
01:15:42,354 --> 01:15:46,654

980
01:15:46,858 --> 01:15:47,825
Spice is in my blood.

01:16:32,571 --> 01:16:34,698
Hey! Where is this man?
Where is this man?

986
01:17:25,457 --> 01:17:27,425
You? You were at the boutique
too, right?

987
01:17:27,793 --> 01:17:30,421
Now l know. You are following us.

988
01:17:43,308 --> 01:17:44,104
Come on, let us go.

989
01:17:58,156 --> 01:18:00,124
What are you looking for Aditya?

990
01:18:00,992 --> 01:18:03,119
What was l looking for?

991
01:18:05,831 --> 01:18:09,790
Brooklyn Tower! l wanted to see
it since my childhood.

992
01:18:10,335 --> 01:18:11,802
lt's very beautiful, isn't it?

993
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:15,966
Thanks for everything.

994
01:18:16,174 --> 01:18:18,642
You should not thank me.
You should thank Zubin.

995
01:18:18,844 --> 01:18:19,469
He paid the bill.

996
01:18:20,679 --> 01:18:22,442
No, l did not mean that.

997
01:18:23,014 --> 01:18:24,811
l really had a great time this evening.

998
01:18:26,184 --> 01:18:34,319
Me too. ln fact after 7 years
l have laughed so much.

999
01:18:36,862 --> 01:18:40,992
7 years? Can l ask you
something? Hope you will..

1000
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:42,166
..not feel bad.

1001
01:18:42,534 --> 01:18:45,002
Did you love a girl in the college?

1002
01:18:48,874 --> 01:18:52,002
l heard that she broke your heart
so you left college and..

1003
01:18:52,210 --> 01:18:54,007
..went away.

1004
01:18:58,717 --> 01:19:01,015
We did not come to know
where you had gone.

1005
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:05,850
You just disappeared. You used
to love that girl very..

1006
01:19:06,057 --> 01:19:13,020
..much, right? Do you
love her now also?

1007
01:19:16,902 --> 01:19:20,702
l am sorry...l think you
are unable to forget her.

1008
01:19:23,909 --> 01:19:27,709
You don't mind me asking...
Who she was.

1009
01:19:29,247 --> 01:19:33,206
Look if only you want it.
l might be of some help to you.

1010
01:19:33,418 --> 01:19:36,216
Please tell me who was she.

1011
01:19:36,421 --> 01:19:38,889
You.

1012
01:19:46,264 --> 01:19:48,391
How can you help me?

1013
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:58,068
Ok. Now she is already married.

1014
01:20:00,278 --> 01:20:03,736
Then you can get any good girl.

1015
01:20:04,015 --> 01:20:04,913
You forget her.

1016
01:20:05,116 --> 01:20:09,075
No. l will marry her only.

1017
01:20:09,287 --> 01:20:13,087
lf l get married then l will marry
her only otherwise...

1018
01:20:17,295 --> 01:20:22,426
lf Suhan hadn't come, the show
would've ended before the start.

1019
01:20:54,332 --> 01:20:56,129
ln thirty seconds she will
come out wearing a nightie.

1020
01:21:02,741 --> 01:21:04,971
Oh! But where have l kept the remote?

1021
01:21:11,349 --> 01:21:12,475
Oh! Yes, in the kitchen.

1022
01:21:17,022 --> 01:21:22,654
She will jump on the couch.
Now she will watch..

1023
01:21:22,861 --> 01:21:24,158
..emotional films and cry
like Meena Kumari.

1024
01:21:31,870 --> 01:21:32,461
What are you doing?

1025
01:21:33,004 --> 01:21:34,995
l am eating chocolate and
studying the case.

1026
01:21:36,541 --> 01:21:37,838
That's enough. Excuse me.

1027
01:21:38,043 --> 01:21:40,170
What is it? Are you a wrestler?

1028
01:21:40,378 --> 01:21:41,504
What will you do by watching?

1029
01:21:41,947 --> 01:21:45,348
l don't think you should watch
like this. -Why?

1030
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:47,347
Then you too will fall in love.

1031
01:21:48,219 --> 01:21:55,022
What? l don't need anybody's love.

1032
01:21:55,226 --> 01:21:58,024
l am happy alone. You keep
your Piya to yourself.

1033
01:22:00,398 --> 01:22:02,025
Now what have you done?

1034
01:22:17,816 --> 01:22:18,714
Satellite connection?

1035
01:22:18,917 --> 01:22:21,715
No. Telescope. - Oh! Fantastic.

1036
01:22:24,923 --> 01:22:28,051
Yeah. Pop corn? -Yeah.

1037
01:23:33,491 --> 01:23:42,627
''lt is an unknown city.''

1038
01:23:43,001 --> 01:23:51,966
''lt is an unknown evening.''

1039
01:23:52,510 --> 01:23:59,473
''Life is...

1040
01:23:59,684 --> 01:24:06,487
..unknown.''

1041
01:24:06,691 --> 01:24:16,327
''What is your name?''

1042
01:24:16,534 --> 01:24:18,661
''Strange is this life.''

1043
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:21,168
''This life is strange.''

1044
01:24:21,372 --> 01:24:23,340
''Here you meet then separate.''

1045
01:24:23,608 --> 01:24:25,667
''After separation again we meet.''

1046
01:24:32,383 --> 01:24:41,348
''lt is an unknown city.''
