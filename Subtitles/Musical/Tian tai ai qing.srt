1
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:17,959
Ha! A hundred for posture, zero for score.

2
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,251
That's okay, posture is all that matters.

3
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:24,584
I've got pictures of your poses

4
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,084
but none of your gutter balls.

5
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:30,667
What was that last ball?

6
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:33,334
A bowling ball.

7
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:35,376
I know that, idiot.

8
00:01:36,167 --> 00:01:37,584
Oh, it was a UFO ball.

9
00:01:39,084 --> 00:01:41,126
If that was a UFO ball,

10
00:01:41,126 --> 00:01:42,626
then where are the aliens?

11
00:01:44,334 --> 00:01:46,126
Hey Tempura, you're up.

12
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:50,959
Wow, you think you're so fly!

13
00:01:56,084 --> 00:01:56,501
Ah, man.

14
00:01:56,501 --> 00:01:57,251
Shit.

15
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:00,917
That gutter ball wasn't because of my head.

16
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:05,376
Come one, come all! Have a seat.

17
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:07,751

22
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:15,876
a clinic where you can watch a show?

23
00:02:15,876 --> 00:02:17,334
No, right?

24
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:19,792
Shows makes people happy,

25
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:21,501
and happiness is a cure-all.

26
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:23,042

What a bad time

30
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:29,376
for those kids to be late.

31
00:02:29,376 --> 00:02:30,167

Oh, sorry.

Ready, go.

103
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:28,417
Hello, sister-in-law!

104
00:06:31,376 --> 00:06:32,459
What the hell?

105
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:34,751

Oh, come on.

She's your dream lover.

108
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,376
So we should say hi at least.

109
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:39,834
Aiyah, I'm going to starve to death.

110
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:40,917
Is dinner ready?

111
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:42,459
Hey, whose turn is it to get sweet potatoes?

112
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:43,459
Sweet potatoes?

113
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:45,459
Egg.

114
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:46,376
It's your turn, Egg.

115
00:06:46,376 --> 00:06:47,876
Bullshit. Why me?

116
00:06:47,876 --> 00:06:48,792
I don't wanna.
You look the most like a sweet potato.

117
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:49,792
Come on, let's go up.

118
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:51,459
You look like a sweet potato.

119
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:52,334
You're the vegetable.

120
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:59,001
<i>OK, we're home.</i>

121
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:00,667
Tempura and A-Lang, welcome home!

122
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:01,667
You're unzipped again.

123
00:07:03,751 --> 00:07:05,917
Hey A-Lang, where have you been?

124
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:07,084
Off making money, where else?

125
00:07:08,251 --> 00:07:10,876
Look at you two, so romantic.

126
00:07:10,876 --> 00:07:11,709
You're back already?

127
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:13,876
Give me a theme song.

128
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:18,792
Hey Wax.

129
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:20,251
<i>Aren't you fired, Choco?</i>

130
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:21,334
Yeah.

131
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:25,292
Wanna touch my little sweet potato?

132
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:27,292
I'd rather eat the real thing.

133
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:28,167
Where's Sweet Potato Girl?

134
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:29,376
Inside.

135
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:36,459
Hurry, hurry, hurry

136
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,626
Hey, there's still some left.

137
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:43,251
Hey!

138
00:07:43,251 --> 00:07:44,834
What are you doin', stealing my potatoes?

139
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:46,334
Rotten Egg,
how dare you steal my sweet potatoes!

140
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:47,084
How dare you!

141
00:07:47,084 --> 00:07:48,459
You stole my sweet potatoes!

142
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:49,709
It was THEM!

143
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:51,626
Who is "them"? These are for dinner.

144
00:07:51,626 --> 00:07:53,042
Hey, Sweet Potato Girl.

145
00:07:54,251 --> 00:07:55,667
Tempura

146
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,167
I'm the one who was hungry
for sweet potatoes.

147
00:07:58,167 --> 00:07:59,542
Oh.

148
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:00,876
It's okay, then.

149
00:08:00,876 --> 00:08:04,459
You can have as many as you want.

150
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:05,626
Then one more for me.

151
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:07,417
Mind your own business, I didn't mean you.

152
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:11,417
Sorry, Tempura, I need to go back to work.

153
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:12,917
Okay, go do your work.

154
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,417
Hey, did you ever notice

155
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:19,751
that Sweet Potato Girl is kinda pretty

156
00:08:19,751 --> 00:08:21,542
when she's not being mean?

157
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,084
Mirror, mirror on the wall

158
00:08:23,084 --> 00:08:23,917
if someone was saying

159
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:26,251
mean things about you behind your back

160
00:08:26,251 --> 00:08:27,626
what would you do?

161
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:32,709
I'd make them throw up their sweet potatoes.

162
00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:39,834
<i>I know how to be easygoing.</i>

163
00:08:39,834 --> 00:08:42,001
<i>I know how to cook.</i>

164
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:45,042
<i>I know that I'm your type.</i>

165
00:08:45,042 --> 00:08:46,042
<i>Who'd you hear that from?</i>

166
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:48,001
<i>I deliver goods and carry bricks.</i>

167
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:50,001
<i>I dodge the debt collectors.</i>

168
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:53,126
<i>Every day we're just fooling around.</i>

169
00:08:53,126 --> 00:08:54,001
<i>Smear some soy sauce.</i>

170
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,959
<i>I can't afford the sweet potatoes.</i>

171
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:57,917
<i>Just keep fooling around.</i>

172
00:08:57,917 --> 00:09:01,292
<i>Grandpa taught me not to be lazy.</i>

173
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:02,001
<i>You'll turn into a lazy burn.</i>

174
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:03,917
<i>Sit on the water tower and sew.</i>

175
00:09:03,917 --> 00:09:06,042
<i>Pound the laundry
and work out those muscles.</i>

176
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:09,501
<i>Auntie told the sparrow that he's meaty.</i>

177
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:13,876
<i>Open the windows dry out the blankets.</i>

178
00:09:13,876 --> 00:09:17,876
<i>The birds are singing do-do-do-do-re-mi.</i>

179
00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:19,959
<i>The moonlight is beautiful.</i>

180
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,209
<i>The air is so fresh.</i>

181
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:24,626
<i>I'm hungry but satisfied.</i>

182
00:09:24,626 --> 00:09:25,626
<i>Hoot</i>

183
00:09:25,917 --> 00:09:28,001
<i>There is so much love around here.</i>

184
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,917
<i>If we laughed more, life would hurt less.</i>

185
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:33,834
<i>On this rooftop, we're closer to the sky.</i>

186
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:36,001
<i>When it rains, we can wash our hair.</i>

187
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:37,959
<i>We can even barbeque
right outside our house.</i>

188
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:40,959
<i>We don't need to watch any movies
because we are the story.</i>

189
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:41,959
<i>Yes, we are the story.</i>

190
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:43,917
<i>We can't afford to buy diamonds.</i>

191
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,834
<i>But we can always play mahjong.</i>

192
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:49,209
<i>But we played the wrong tile
because of our singing.</i>

193
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:50,042
<i>Ah, you're an idiot.</i>

194
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:51,917
<i>We don't have money, but we have friends.</i>

195
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:53,834
<i>We love to dream, but we won't bother you.</i>

196
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:57,876
<i>No matter how cruel the world is,
we won't complain.</i>

197
00:09:57,876 --> 00:10:02,042
<i>Loneliness is always welcome
on this rooftop.</i>

198
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:13,709
Why did you start dinner without me?

199
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:15,292
Well, you were busy singing.

200
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:17,667
Wax, hurry up, it's getting cold.

201
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:19,459
Wow, looks delicious! Dig in.

202
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:20,417
Jasmine

203
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:21,959
We have a new show at the clinic.

204
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:22,709
How about I take you to see it?

205
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:24,251
Oh, that would be nice.

206
00:10:24,251 --> 00:10:25,167
I'll go with you.

207
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,626
Go with me, go with me!

208
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,751
Hey, mind your own business.

209
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:29,501
It's complicated down there in Galilee City.

210
00:10:29,501 --> 00:10:31,834
Come on, everybody, eat up.

211
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:32,376
Here, have some of this.

212
00:10:32,376 --> 00:10:33,376
Jasmine, look at him.

213
00:10:33,376 --> 00:10:34,834
Alright now, eat up.

214
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,626
Aiyoh

215
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:37,876
Jasmine, Jasmine

216
00:10:37,876 --> 00:10:39,084
You're such a great cook!

217
00:10:39,084 --> 00:10:40,876
Why don't you open a restaurant in Galilee?

218
00:10:40,876 --> 00:10:42,167
We can make some money that way.

219
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:44,501
Yeah, you should open a restaurant!

220
00:10:44,501 --> 00:10:47,001
You all enjoy my cooking,
that's enough for me.

221
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:48,417
I don't know how to run a business.

222
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:50,959
I know how!

223
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,626
Whoa, the sweet potatoes
don't taste very sweet today.

224
00:10:55,334 --> 00:10:56,459
Mirror, mirror on the wall.

225
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:57,126
Wait a second.

226
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,501
Oh, Jasmine, look at him.

227
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:02,917
All you do all day is

228
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:04,167
horse around.

229
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:05,876
That's why you're all single.

230
00:11:05,876 --> 00:11:07,459
I have a boyfriend.

231
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:09,459
Who?

232
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:10,876
Someone in my dreams.

233
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:12,792
Wax

234
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:14,042
When are you going to bring a girlfriend home

235
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:15,876
and introduce her to us?

236
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,751
Hey, why don't you musicians

237
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:20,209
compose a song for us single men?

238
00:11:22,084 --> 00:11:22,876
The same song as last time.

239
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:44,667
Hey look, you guys!

240
00:11:45,126 --> 00:11:47,917
Dr. Bo's new car is so rad!

241
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:50,376
Wow, let's drive it to Tempura's party

242
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,001
and surprise him.

243
00:11:52,001 --> 00:11:53,584
You can't go in your pajamas.

244
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:56,251
Pajamas? Are you nuts?

245
00:11:56,251 --> 00:11:59,167
These are my Woodstock clothes.

246
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:02,501
It's the latest fashion for hippies.

247
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:06,209
All you need's a bandana, some music

248
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:09,459
and you can relax on the lawn.

249
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:12,501
Wow.

250
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:18,042
Show some respect for an artist.

251
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:21,459
Daddy, please.

252
00:12:21,751 --> 00:12:25,084
Can I borrow your car?

253
00:12:25,084 --> 00:12:26,251
So you've seen it?

254
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:28,876
Let me tell you

255
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:33,751
my car has got shiny rims

256
00:12:33,751 --> 00:12:36,542
snowy white leather seats

257
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:39,209
shocks that are as flexible as a mattress.

258
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:42,626
Wow, more comfy than my bed!

259
00:12:42,626 --> 00:12:45,709
So, can I borrow it?

260
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:47,834
Of course not.

261
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:48,709
Huh?

262
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:51,542
What's that sound?

263
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:57,126
Hey! Wait!

264
00:12:57,126 --> 00:12:59,876
That's my new car!

265
00:12:59,876 --> 00:13:01,834
Come back so I can kick your asses!

266
00:13:02,126 --> 00:13:02,959
Hmmph

267
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:12,876
It's very nice to see you all today.

268
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,417
Thank you all for

269
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:17,751
collecting rent for Rango over the past year.

270
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:19,209
Rango's position

271
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:21,542
can't be filled by just anyone.

272
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:24,417
Only I can choose who can do this job.

273
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:27,709
Without all of you,
there'd be no City Housing Authority.

274
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:31,251
Without Rango, there'd be no city of Galilee.

275
00:13:31,251 --> 00:13:31,876
<i>Rango, come up and say a few words.</i>

276
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,501
Gentlemen

277
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:51,751
In keeping with precedent,
I'd like to announce

278
00:13:51,751 --> 00:13:56,376
the person who collected
the most rent last year.

279
00:13:56,376 --> 00:13:57,167
It was Big Red again.

280
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:01,251
Big Red is in charge of the East District

281
00:14:01,251 --> 00:14:04,001
and its 102 stores and 7 night clubs

282
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:05,792
as well as the toughest job,
the Dragon Gate Baths.

283
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:08,251
Okay everybody,
raise your glasses to Big Red.

284
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:11,209
Cheers

285
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:12,751
Range, I need to be on my way.

286
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:13,792
Okay, I won't keep you.

287
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:14,042
Okay.

288
00:14:14,334 --> 00:14:16,126
Don't forget our golf game.

289
00:14:16,126 --> 00:14:17,126
I'll be there.

290
00:14:17,126 --> 00:14:18,084
Music

291
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:22,001
Rango

292
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:24,417
Everybody take your seats.

293
00:14:25,584 --> 00:14:29,417
Big Red topped the charts this year.

294
00:14:29,417 --> 00:14:32,126
But the payments
have dropped off in recent months.

295
00:14:32,126 --> 00:14:33,126
Is there something wrong?

296
00:14:33,334 --> 00:14:35,001
Tell me, I'll take care of it.

297
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,376
Did you hear what Rango said?

298
00:14:39,376 --> 00:14:41,459
What have you been doing?

299
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,292
I'm sorry, Rango.

300
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:47,834
Your big brother's a bit of a hothead.

301
00:14:47,834 --> 00:14:50,126
Just like me when I was young.

302
00:14:50,751 --> 00:14:52,376
Get used to it.

303
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:54,792
Drink up, everybody.

304
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:56,667
Cheers, cheers.

305
00:14:58,001 --> 00:14:59,834
In addition to Big Red

306
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:01,876
we also have a dark horse.

307
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:04,042
Tempura

308
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,001
Yes, Rango, sir.

309
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:09,334
You're new

310
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:13,376
and collect from small hawkers
in the South District

311
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:17,751
But you've been doing very well.

312
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:18,501
That's my job, boss.

313
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:22,792
Big Red,
assign him a street in the East District.

314
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:25,834
Give him the Dragon Gate Baths.

315
00:15:27,251 --> 00:15:28,292
The Dragon Gate Baths?

316
00:15:29,084 --> 00:15:30,667
I'm done with lunch.

317
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:33,501
Anyone who wants some leftovers,
be my guest.

318
00:15:39,417 --> 00:15:40,376
Tempura, sit.

319
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:41,376
Cheers.

320
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:44,834
Oh

321
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:48,709
Shit

322
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:50,459
Oh, no

323
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:51,751
It's a new car.

324
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:54,251
Um... you go ahead without us.

325
00:15:55,251 --> 00:15:57,334
What the hell? It's a new car.

326
00:15:57,334 --> 00:15:57,876
What about your new car?

327
00:15:57,876 --> 00:15:58,584
Hey, wait a second.

328
00:15:59,209 --> 00:15:59,959
Wax

329
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,501
I'll fix the light, I'll fix it.

330
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:03,584
Big Red, he's a friend.

331
00:16:04,084 --> 00:16:06,459
A friend of who?

332
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:09,001
You're not getting out?

333
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:10,751
We thought you had it under control.

334
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:14,209
I got stuck, I can't move.

335
00:16:14,251 --> 00:16:16,792
It's time to eat.

336
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:18,751
Oh. Then let's go eat.

337
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:19,709
Hey, why are you here?

338
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:20,792
You skipped work?

339
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:21,292
No.

340
00:16:21,334 --> 00:16:24,001
We wanted to show you Dr. Bo's new car,
but...

341
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:25,334
It's pretty cool, let's go.

342
00:16:25,334 --> 00:16:25,876
Let me introduce you to Rango.

343
00:16:25,876 --> 00:16:27,876
Rango, these are my brothers.

344
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,376
Say hello to Rango.

345
00:16:29,376 --> 00:16:30,959
Hello, Rango.

346
00:16:31,376 --> 00:16:33,251
Have a seat.

347
00:16:34,001 --> 00:16:35,084
Get them something to drink.

348
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:37,376
No, let me get that.

349
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:40,084
Get a glass, and drink a toast to Rango.

350
00:16:40,126 --> 00:16:41,751
Relax, relax

351
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,584
have some food and drinks.

352
00:16:46,084 --> 00:16:49,876
Tempura,
you're okay with the Dragon Gate Baths?

353
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:51,917
No problem.

354
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:53,459
My bros and I will take care of it tomorrow.

355
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:04,084
Wax, I know you're the man.

356
00:17:04,584 --> 00:17:05,959
Why don't we go now, it's not too late

357
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,542
otherwise Big Red will collect the rent.

358
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,167
Collect the rent?

359
00:17:09,876 --> 00:17:11,501
We're not here to take a bath?

360
00:17:11,501 --> 00:17:14,834
I skipped my shower last night for this.

361
00:17:14,876 --> 00:17:17,042
Maybe we should go have some
egg drop soup.

362
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:18,542
Are you ready?

363
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:22,084
Did you see that badass attitude yesterday?

364
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:23,792
That's what you lack.

365
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:26,751
Yeah. Attitude.

366
00:17:34,626 --> 00:17:36,667
Boys on the left.

367
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:38,042
Girls on the right.

368
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:42,834
We're not here to bathe

369
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:44,084
we're here to collect rent.

370
00:17:46,584 --> 00:17:48,584
Collecting rent? Ha.

371
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,084
You guys look like you work out.

372
00:17:51,084 --> 00:17:52,126
But there are a lot more

373
00:17:52,126 --> 00:17:53,584
guys with muscles inside.

374
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:55,251
Deal with the guys inside first
and then we'll talk.

375
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:58,834
And put your clothes on. You'll catch a cold.

376
00:17:58,834 --> 00:18:00,709
Put your clothes on.

377
00:18:02,001 --> 00:18:02,501
For real?

378
00:18:02,501 --> 00:18:03,501
Ha

379
00:18:03,501 --> 00:18:04,709
Just you wait.

380
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,209
We'll see if you still wanna say "ha" after this.

381
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:07,251
Ha

382
00:18:07,251 --> 00:18:08,376
Let's go.

383
00:18:11,917 --> 00:18:13,542
Stay calm, stay calm.

384
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:15,251
Those are all temporary tattoos.

385
00:18:15,834 --> 00:18:17,501
You want Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck?

386
00:18:18,376 --> 00:18:19,417
We have some at home.

387
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:21,334
Come on, follow me

388
00:18:21,459 --> 00:18:22,709
Follow you, follow you.

389
00:18:23,292 --> 00:18:25,292
Then I want both Mickey and Donald.

390
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:28,501
We're here to collect rent.

391
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:29,542
Come on, pay UP!

392
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:30,876
What are you taking a bath for?

393
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:38,376
Maybe another day.

394
00:18:38,376 --> 00:18:38,792
Good idea.

395
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:41,001
What do you mean another day?

396
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:42,751
Pay UP-

397
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:43,751
You wanna die?

398
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:47,126
You're afraid of him?

399
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,209
Yeah

400
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:51,626
How about a song before we die?

401
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:57,042
<i>Ah</i>

402
00:18:57,542 --> 00:18:59,834
<i>You want to fight me</i>

403
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:02,001
<i>but didn't you hear?</i>

404
00:19:02,001 --> 00:19:05,667
<i>My fist is unstoppable.</i>

405
00:19:17,001 --> 00:19:18,959
<i>I can do the splits.</i>

406
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:21,126
<i>My legs are firm and steady.</i>

407
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:24,792
<i>And now I'll reward you
with the famous Buddha Palm.</i>

408
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:25,459
<i>Wah-lih -lay-heng</i>

409
00:19:25,459 --> 00:19:27,209
<i>A tiger tattoo on my left chest.</i>

410
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:27,709
<i>Tiger tiger</i>

411
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,334
<i>A dragon scar on my right arm.</i>

412
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:29,876
<i>Dragon dragon</i>

413
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:33,376
<i>You better hurry
and apologize to me right now.</i>

414
00:19:33,376 --> 00:19:34,667
<i>I am sorry.</i>

415
00:19:35,376 --> 00:19:37,459
No way.

416
00:19:40,042 --> 00:19:41,376
<i>I'm the real thing.</i>

417
00:19:41,376 --> 00:19:42,376
<i>Brush brush</i>

418
00:19:42,376 --> 00:19:43,584
<i>I'll hit you so hard, you'll cry for your mama.</i>

419
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:44,376
Ma-ma

420
00:19:44,376 --> 00:19:48,459
<i>Just 'cause you're big and strong
doesn't make you the boss.</i>

421
00:19:58,167 --> 00:19:59,084
A-Lang, let's go.

422
00:19:59,084 --> 00:20:01,001
Leave him.

423
00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:07,292
Say sorry.

424
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,209
You should have paid up in the first place.

425
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:11,626
So, listen.

426
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:13,417
My name's Tempura, the rent collector.

427
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:14,792
Remember me next time. Thank you.

428
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:18,584
<i>I may not be a master like them</i>

429
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,792
<i>I may not be a master like them,
but look out.</i>

430
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:29,876
<i>I am a rose wrapped in thorns,
left on the side of the road.</i>

431
00:20:34,709 --> 00:20:36,959
Aiyah, just in time.

432
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:39,709
I told you to take the side exit.

433
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:41,292
You lost, pay up.

434
00:20:41,292 --> 00:20:42,334
All right, I owe you one.

435
00:20:44,001 --> 00:20:45,334
Did that hurt?

436
00:20:45,334 --> 00:20:47,251
You heartless bastards.

437
00:20:48,001 --> 00:20:49,292
Get up, get UP-

438
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:51,542
You're running away?

439
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,501
Hurry up, he's coming

440
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,751
Wax, he looks really hurt.

441
00:20:53,751 --> 00:20:55,042
Shall we take him to Dr. Bo?

442
00:20:55,042 --> 00:20:56,001
No, we don't want Dr. Bo to find out.

443
00:20:56,001 --> 00:20:57,417
Slow down.

444
00:20:58,584 --> 00:20:59,667
Ah, catch me if you can.

445
00:21:00,584 --> 00:21:00,959
Oh! No! Stop!

446
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,292
Hey, listen. What's going on?

447
00:21:02,292 --> 00:21:03,751
It's a domestic dispute, none of our business.

448
00:21:05,001 --> 00:21:06,167
Let me go!

449
00:21:07,709 --> 00:21:09,167
Cut, cut, cut

450
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,876
What are you doing?
We're shooting a film here!

451
00:21:10,876 --> 00:21:12,042
Don't you see that camera?

452
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:13,917
Stop it, those are MY lines.

453
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:15,667
Who's the director, you or me?

454
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:17,626
Don't you see that camera?

455
00:21:17,626 --> 00:21:18,876
Again from the top!

456
00:21:18,876 --> 00:21:20,167
Really pisses me off.

457
00:21:39,584 --> 00:21:41,792
Ha ha, it's a rare injury for you.

458
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:43,792
Let's capture the moment.

459
00:21:43,792 --> 00:21:45,792
You just love acting tough

460
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:47,084
and playing it cool, don't you?

461
00:21:47,084 --> 00:21:47,876
Wax

462
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:52,292
Hmm, what's that strange flavor?

463
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:54,876
I'll mix another one.

464
00:21:54,876 --> 00:21:56,209
If I didn't teach you Kung-Fu

465
00:21:56,209 --> 00:21:57,292
you'd be dead.

466
00:21:57,292 --> 00:21:58,334
Hmmph.

467
00:21:58,334 --> 00:21:59,626
Dad

468
00:21:59,626 --> 00:22:01,001
Why didn't you ever teach me Kung-Fu?

469
00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:03,251
Your legs are too short to kick anyone.

470
00:22:03,251 --> 00:22:04,959
What about you?

471
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:06,042
Wow, so long.

472
00:22:06,251 --> 00:22:07,751
Hold still.

473
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:11,334
Dr. Bo, I was the hero who saved the day.

474
00:22:11,334 --> 00:22:14,042
Yeah, a hero in someone else's movie.

475
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:14,792
What movie?

476
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,334
We also saw what's-his-name.

477
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:17,626
Saw who?

478
00:22:17,626 --> 00:22:19,251
Some stuntman.

479
00:22:19,251 --> 00:22:20,792
Oh yeah, a stuntman.

480
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:21,459
Stuntman?

481
00:22:22,751 --> 00:22:24,084
Ah, how I miss the old days.

482
00:22:24,084 --> 00:22:25,917
Dr. Bo, were you a stuntman?

483
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:27,751
How else you think I learned Kung-fu?

484
00:22:28,751 --> 00:22:29,042
Yeah

485
00:22:29,042 --> 00:22:30,542
That's why Dr. Bo opened his clinic.

486
00:22:30,542 --> 00:22:31,542
Stuntmen get hurt all the time.

487
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:32,126
And?

488
00:22:32,126 --> 00:22:33,959
What's the clinic got to do with stuntmen?

489
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:35,501
Are you an idiot?

490
00:22:35,501 --> 00:22:36,626
Of course the reason

491
00:22:36,626 --> 00:22:37,751
my dad runs the clinic

492
00:22:37,751 --> 00:22:38,834
is to make money.

493
00:22:38,834 --> 00:22:39,709
The more injuries there are,

494
00:22:39,709 --> 00:22:41,334
the bigger the profits.

495
00:22:41,334 --> 00:22:42,792
Tofu, do you have to pay for treatment here?

496
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:43,626
Of course not.

497
00:22:43,626 --> 00:22:44,417
Great, let me kick your ass.

498
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:45,709
No! Daddy!

499
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:46,792
Watch what you say.

500
00:22:46,792 --> 00:22:48,459
You make me sound like a profiteer.

501
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:49,459
If it weren't for me

502
00:22:49,459 --> 00:22:51,042
who'd take care of you?

503
00:22:51,042 --> 00:22:52,417
Oh

504
00:22:54,001 --> 00:22:55,751
Back in the day

505
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:57,584
so many actresses fancied me.

506
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,751
The other actors just hated me.

507
00:23:01,126 --> 00:23:02,626
Hey, that's for Wax.

508
00:23:02,626 --> 00:23:03,751
Then pour another.

509
00:23:03,751 --> 00:23:04,126
All right.

510
00:23:04,126 --> 00:23:06,417
Dr. Bo, you're not finished with me yet.

511
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:08,042
Just a minute, it won't kill you to wait.

512
00:23:09,876 --> 00:23:11,167
Where was I?

513
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:15,459
Back in the day.

514
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:17,667
So many actors fell for me.

515
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:19,167
Actresses.

516
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:20,542
No, sorry.

517
00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:21,876
Back in the day

518
00:23:21,876 --> 00:23:22,626
So many

519
00:23:22,626 --> 00:23:23,959
So many mosquitoes, why?

520
00:23:24,292 --> 00:23:24,834
Back in the day

521
00:23:27,042 --> 00:23:29,751
At nightfall, the stars shine.

522
00:23:29,751 --> 00:23:32,417
Dear Rooftop residents,

523
00:23:32,417 --> 00:23:34,292
at the end of a beautiful day

524
00:23:34,292 --> 00:23:37,376
here's a song for you.

525
00:24:22,709 --> 00:24:24,917
This is A-Lang, who's calling?

526
00:24:24,917 --> 00:24:25,667
Idiot.

527
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:27,167
I'm looking for Jasmine.

528
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:28,834
You knocked six times.

529
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,376
That was five.

530
00:24:30,376 --> 00:24:32,167
Oh, I see.

531
00:24:32,834 --> 00:24:34,001
Are you trying to tell Jasmine

532
00:24:34,001 --> 00:24:36,501
about how you met the girl
of your dreams today?

533
00:24:37,501 --> 00:24:39,126
Idiot.

534
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:54,251
<i>The sky darkens with the passing clouds.</i>

535
00:24:54,251 --> 00:24:58,667
<i>The waves roll quietly in the soft wind.</i>

536
00:24:58,667 --> 00:25:07,209
<i>Though you're far away,
you've made me so happy.</i>

537
00:25:07,209 --> 00:25:11,459
<i>Forgive me, I'm using this camera to pretend</i>

538
00:25:11,459 --> 00:25:16,626
<i>like I'm kissing you, though you're far away.</i>

539
00:25:16,626 --> 00:25:24,584
<i>Through the camera's shutter,
you're my eternal love.</i>

540
00:25:28,376 --> 00:25:29,167
Good

541
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:29,709
Cut, cut, cut

542
00:25:29,709 --> 00:25:30,667
William, great job. You're quite the actor.

543
00:25:30,876 --> 00:25:31,376
Great job.

544
00:25:31,376 --> 00:25:32,792
Come on over here.

545
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:35,334
William, great job.

546
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:36,084
Great job.

547
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:39,292
With you in the cast, this'll be a huge hit.

548
00:25:39,292 --> 00:25:40,417
That's because you're a good director.

549
00:25:40,417 --> 00:25:41,792
Aw, shucks. Yes I am.

550
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:43,001
So, should we call it a day?

551
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:44,292
Call it a day?

552
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,209
Yeah, let's call it a day.

553
00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:46,001
Okay, one moment please.

554
00:25:46,001 --> 00:25:46,584
Okay.

555
00:25:46,834 --> 00:25:48,001
That's it for today, everybody.

556
00:25:48,001 --> 00:25:51,417
Thank you William.

557
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:52,751
Thank you everybody, good job!

558
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:53,792
You're welcome.

559
00:25:53,792 --> 00:25:55,167
It's all thanks to William.

560
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:55,626
William

561
00:25:55,626 --> 00:25:56,834
William, here comes Starling.

562
00:25:57,084 --> 00:25:58,834
Thank you, thank you William.

563
00:25:58,834 --> 00:25:59,959
Thank you William.

564
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:00,792
You're very welcome.

565
00:26:03,459 --> 00:26:04,876
Starling has great potential.

566
00:26:04,876 --> 00:26:05,667
You'll be a star.

567
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:06,626
A star.

568
00:26:06,626 --> 00:26:07,834
Say thank you to William.

569
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:08,667
Thank you.

570
00:26:08,917 --> 00:26:09,626
Oh, by the way

571
00:26:09,626 --> 00:26:11,167
I booked a lane at the bowling alley tonight.

572
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:11,834
Anyone interested in going?

573
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:14,417
Yeah, sure.

574
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:15,251
Would you like to go?

575
00:26:15,251 --> 00:26:18,917
We love bowling.

576
00:26:18,917 --> 00:26:21,626
I'll see you tonight, then.

577
00:26:23,376 --> 00:26:24,709
Ok, let's go. Thank you William.

578
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,542
Your car is ready, William.

579
00:26:28,042 --> 00:26:30,126
Of course we should go. Let's go.

580
00:26:39,126 --> 00:26:40,709
Alright, that's about it.

581
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:44,459
Get up.

582
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:53,209
You know why you got beaten up?

583
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:54,292
My accounts aren't in order.

584
00:26:55,876 --> 00:26:57,167
Have I

585
00:26:57,501 --> 00:27:00,417
ever let you guys go hungry?

586
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:02,667
No

587
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:07,751
I hurt your body

588
00:27:09,001 --> 00:27:10,542
but you hurt my trust.

589
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:13,126
I'm sorry, Rango.

590
00:27:13,126 --> 00:27:15,501
Rango is actually a good person.

591
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:19,626
Come on in.

592
00:27:20,459 --> 00:27:21,209
Get him fixed up.

593
00:27:21,584 --> 00:27:22,501
Wax

594
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:23,542
Why don't you wait for me outside.

595
00:27:23,751 --> 00:27:24,334
Ok

596
00:27:24,501 --> 00:27:25,876
Hey, actually, wait a sec.

597
00:27:26,251 --> 00:27:28,126
Why don't you come in with me?

598
00:27:31,459 --> 00:27:33,126
Rango,
here's the rent from the Dragon Gate Baths.

599
00:27:34,542 --> 00:27:36,501
Here. You can count it.

600
00:27:45,084 --> 00:27:46,334
Jiang

601
00:27:52,626 --> 00:27:54,001
<i>What's the matter, Rango?</i>

602
00:27:54,376 --> 00:27:55,584
It's not enough?

603
00:27:59,584 --> 00:28:00,959
It's more than enough.

604
00:28:01,209 --> 00:28:03,417
More than enough?

605
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:06,042
But this is what Big Red's guys collected.

606
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:10,084
Well done.

607
00:28:11,834 --> 00:28:13,792
Dinner's on me.

608
00:28:15,042 --> 00:28:15,792
Thank you, Rango.

609
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:17,126
How's it going?

610
00:28:17,292 --> 00:28:19,126
The street assigned to you isn't easy.

611
00:28:19,126 --> 00:28:21,084
A few of the shops are being difficult.

612
00:28:21,084 --> 00:28:22,959
Do you need more people to help?

613
00:28:23,417 --> 00:28:24,542
Actually, Rango,

614
00:28:24,542 --> 00:28:26,417
the Dragon Gate Baths was tough.

615
00:28:26,626 --> 00:28:27,709
But it was alright thanks to my bro Wax.

616
00:28:27,709 --> 00:28:28,667
He's a good fighter.

617
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:30,501
Wax.

618
00:28:33,126 --> 00:28:34,126
Wax, come here.

619
00:28:35,334 --> 00:28:36,667
Fighting isn't everything

620
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:38,626
I've got plenty of fighters.

621
00:28:38,626 --> 00:28:40,209
I like people who are loyal.

622
00:28:40,209 --> 00:28:41,542
Do you have a job?

623
00:28:41,542 --> 00:28:43,626
Do you want to come work for me?

624
00:28:43,626 --> 00:28:45,709
I work in a clinic.

625
00:28:45,709 --> 00:28:47,667
If your people get hurt, send them to me

626
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:48,751
for medical treatment.

627
00:28:49,334 --> 00:28:49,834
Watch your mouth.

628
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:52,042
Think it over.

629
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:54,542
There isn't much to think about, actually.

630
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:58,542
I don't like having a boss.

631
00:29:00,126 --> 00:29:01,667
I like this kid.

632
00:29:03,001 --> 00:29:04,667
You know why I like you?

633
00:29:07,209 --> 00:29:08,709
You don't beat around the bush.

634
00:29:09,042 --> 00:29:09,834
Thank you, Rango.

635
00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:11,959
Okay, you can go now.

636
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,834
Thank you, Rango.

637
00:29:14,042 --> 00:29:15,334
Let's go.

638
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:30,751
William, here's the thing.

639
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:32,251
You'd be smart to buy our cinema.

640
00:29:32,251 --> 00:29:34,459
It's a real money maker.

641
00:29:34,459 --> 00:29:35,376
Yes, William.

642
00:29:35,376 --> 00:29:37,001
Every time we show your movies

643
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:38,626
the tickets sell out.

644
00:29:38,626 --> 00:29:40,542
We've made a fortune.

645
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:42,792
Then why are you selling it?

646
00:29:44,334 --> 00:29:46,876
William, listen to me, you're a huge star.

647
00:29:46,876 --> 00:29:47,959
Wouldn't it be great

648
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:49,417
if you had your own movie theater?

649
00:29:49,417 --> 00:29:51,209
Come on,now, gentlemen!

650
00:29:51,209 --> 00:29:53,209
No more shop talk.

651
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:55,126
Drink up. Come on, let's have some fun.

652
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,584
Ha ha, come on.

653
00:29:57,459 --> 00:29:58,876
William, what do you think,

654
00:29:58,876 --> 00:30:01,209
We've got some fine ladies here, right?

655
00:30:01,751 --> 00:30:02,626
Yes

656
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:05,792
Get up and dance!

657
00:30:06,667 --> 00:30:08,334
Take good care of these two gentlemen.

658
00:30:08,334 --> 00:30:10,792
Show them some dance moves.

659
00:30:15,667 --> 00:30:16,876
Oh, it's Big Red!

660
00:30:16,876 --> 00:30:18,667
William, here's a good friend of mine

661
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:19,501
that I want you to meet.

662
00:30:19,501 --> 00:30:21,417
Perfect timing, have a seat.

663
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:23,042
Get them some drinks.

664
00:30:23,209 --> 00:30:24,334
Come on in.

665
00:30:24,334 --> 00:30:25,417
Take a seat.

666
00:30:26,126 --> 00:30:29,084
William, our nightclub business depends

667
00:30:29,084 --> 00:30:30,459
so much on Big Red's goodwill.

668
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:32,292
We never have any trouble.

669
00:30:32,292 --> 00:30:33,959
If you encounter any trouble during the

670
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:35,459
filming, just call Big Red.

671
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:36,959
All you need is

672
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:39,334
Mike, thank you

673
00:30:39,334 --> 00:30:42,292
The director and producers deal with that.

674
00:30:42,292 --> 00:30:44,084
It's got nothing to do with actors.

675
00:30:44,084 --> 00:30:45,626
And besides, we don't work with

676
00:30:45,626 --> 00:30:48,126
people that have questionable backgrounds.

677
00:30:48,126 --> 00:30:48,959
Watch your attitude.

678
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:51,626
Hey, relax, relax, relax.

679
00:30:51,626 --> 00:30:53,667
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

680
00:30:53,917 --> 00:30:56,459
William, I think it's time to go.

681
00:30:56,459 --> 00:30:57,417
Tomorrow morning

682
00:30:57,417 --> 00:31:00,667
you're playing golf with the mayor.

683
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:03,417
Yes, William and the mayor are good friends,

684
00:31:04,334 --> 00:31:06,251
You and the Mayor are friends?

685
00:31:07,501 --> 00:31:11,792
I've also met with him several times.

686
00:31:11,792 --> 00:31:15,959
Lee, let me get this.

687
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:18,626
Oh, wonderful, how nice.

688
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:19,959
Thank you, William.

689
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:21,459
William, thank you. Thank you.

690
00:31:21,459 --> 00:31:23,334
I'll see you soon, William

691
00:31:23,334 --> 00:31:25,876
Thank you, Bao, thank you.

692
00:31:26,792 --> 00:31:28,334
Today is the day.

693
00:31:28,334 --> 00:31:29,626
I'm gonna win that motorcycle

694
00:31:29,626 --> 00:31:31,459
if it's the last thing I do.

695
00:31:31,834 --> 00:31:33,542
Has anyone ever gotten a score of 300 here?

696
00:31:34,834 --> 00:31:36,459
A-Lang, you can do it!

697
00:31:43,251 --> 00:31:43,917
Wow, yes.

698
00:31:44,542 --> 00:31:45,792
Ladies and gentlemen

699
00:31:45,792 --> 00:31:47,709
a bowler in lane five

700
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:50,584
has gotten 11 strikes so far!

701
00:31:50,584 --> 00:31:51,292
That's A-Lang!

702
00:31:51,292 --> 00:31:53,709
He's gonna reach 300!

703
00:31:53,709 --> 00:31:55,417
Everybody, come cheer him on.

704
00:31:56,209 --> 00:31:58,626
If he gets it, he'll win a motorcycle!

705
00:31:58,626 --> 00:32:00,709
You sure you got that right?

706
00:32:00,709 --> 00:32:01,501
It's true!

707
00:32:01,501 --> 00:32:02,042
It is.

708
00:32:02,042 --> 00:32:02,876
Really!

709
00:32:03,292 --> 00:32:04,084
300, 300

710
00:32:04,084 --> 00:32:05,167
A-Lang, you can do it!

711
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:14,584
300, 300

712
00:32:33,834 --> 00:32:37,126
Mom, it's okay, I can walk.

713
00:32:37,126 --> 00:32:39,417
No, Lang-Lang, you have a fever.

714
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:41,001
Just hold on a little longer

715
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,917
and we'll be at the doctor's.

716
00:32:48,001 --> 00:32:50,334
Mom, one day I'll buy you a motorcycle

717
00:32:59,042 --> 00:33:00,501
Oh no...

718
00:33:09,126 --> 00:33:11,042
Yay!

719
00:33:11,042 --> 00:33:13,542
Mom, now we can ride together!

720
00:33:20,084 --> 00:33:21,209
Hey, there's a show, too.

721
00:33:21,209 --> 00:33:22,917
Let's go over there and watch.

722
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,209
What the hell?

723
00:33:41,626 --> 00:33:43,251
Who the hell is that freak?

724
00:34:01,876 --> 00:34:06,001
I haven't come out in a very long time.

725
00:34:06,001 --> 00:34:08,084
Actually, I've never come out here before.

726
00:34:08,084 --> 00:34:13,084
Because no one has ever bowled 300.

727
00:34:14,709 --> 00:34:17,292
I'm the boss and you have my word.

728
00:34:17,292 --> 00:34:19,501
Bowl 300 and you get a motorcycle!

729
00:34:19,501 --> 00:34:21,542
From all the colors of the rainbow

730
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:24,709
you can choose the one you like.

731
00:34:24,709 --> 00:34:26,542
Mo Mo Mo Mo

732
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:29,126
Motorcycle

733
00:34:29,126 --> 00:34:31,042
Mo Mo Mo Mo your mom.

734
00:34:31,042 --> 00:34:31,876
Don't even think about running away.

735
00:34:31,876 --> 00:34:34,042
I worked so hard to get 300!

736
00:34:34,042 --> 00:34:35,626
Can people actually ride on those things?

737
00:34:36,042 --> 00:34:38,001
Don't those look like people to you?

738
00:34:38,751 --> 00:34:39,834
Alright, fine.

739
00:34:39,834 --> 00:34:43,001
Well, it's better than nothing.

740
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:47,084
William,
it's been a while since you've taken us out.

741
00:34:52,334 --> 00:34:53,542
Wait up, wait up, wait up!

742
00:34:54,001 --> 00:34:54,917
Why don't we play billiards first?

743
00:34:54,917 --> 00:34:56,334
Everyone plays for free tonight.

744
00:35:04,501 --> 00:35:05,667
William

745
00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:07,167
Have a seat over here

746
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:08,084
Have a seat.

747
00:35:08,084 --> 00:35:09,667
Sit, sit ,sit

748
00:35:13,751 --> 00:35:16,501
William, we're so happy to have you.

749
00:35:16,501 --> 00:35:18,959
What just happened?

750
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:20,459
It was just a skit.

751
00:35:20,459 --> 00:35:22,667
We were just acting.

752
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:23,959
Business is good, huh?

753
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:25,959
Maybe a bit too crowded, actually.

754
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:27,417
Shall I clear the place?

755
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:29,917
No, it's okay. Let's shoot some pool first.

756
00:35:29,917 --> 00:35:32,251
Okay, then, have fun.

757
00:35:35,251 --> 00:35:36,542
Let me take a shot.

758
00:35:37,584 --> 00:35:38,501
You still owe me a motorcycle.

759
00:35:40,876 --> 00:35:43,959
Hey! Pssst!

760
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:50,709
Remember me?

761
00:35:52,459 --> 00:35:53,376
From that day?

762
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:58,334
Hush.

763
00:35:58,626 --> 00:36:01,084
Get lost.

764
00:36:01,084 --> 00:36:02,459
That must be her dad.

765
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:04,542
William, William

766
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:06,792
That's the guy who injured our stuntman.

767
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:07,876
That's him!

768
00:36:16,126 --> 00:36:20,834
He's telling you not to take photos, okay?

769
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:24,584
Wax, watch this.

770
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:28,126
You want an autograph? Sorry, we're busy.

771
00:36:42,751 --> 00:36:45,001
Okay? Okay what?

772
00:36:56,626 --> 00:36:58,501
Hey, are you all right?

773
00:37:02,709 --> 00:37:06,042
Okay, ready, camera

774
00:37:06,042 --> 00:37:07,542
Action

775
00:37:11,917 --> 00:37:15,084
Jump, jump!

776
00:37:16,376 --> 00:37:17,792
Jump!

777
00:37:17,792 --> 00:37:19,084
Cut, cut, cut

778
00:37:19,084 --> 00:37:19,834
This is pissing me off.

779
00:37:19,834 --> 00:37:21,292
Look, are you gonna jump or not?

780
00:37:21,292 --> 00:37:22,584
Who found this guy? Huh?

781
00:37:22,584 --> 00:37:25,334
Director, aren't you the one who found him?

782
00:37:25,334 --> 00:37:26,626
Oh, right.

783
00:37:26,626 --> 00:37:28,667
Keep rolling. Man I'm so pissed off.

784
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:30,251
What are you doing?

785
00:37:30,251 --> 00:37:31,751
You afraid to jump?

786
00:37:31,751 --> 00:37:33,917
Why'd you come if you're scared?

787
00:37:40,251 --> 00:37:42,667
Another guy who just came to see the girl.

788
00:37:43,376 --> 00:37:46,084
Can't blame you, we all wanna do her.

789
00:37:47,376 --> 00:37:47,917
What the hell?

790
00:37:52,251 --> 00:37:54,001
Don't stop, keep filming!

791
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:02,751
Go, go, go!

792
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:10,501
Yes

793
00:38:11,084 --> 00:38:13,084
Come back here!

794
00:38:13,084 --> 00:38:14,459
Aiyah

795
00:38:23,292 --> 00:38:25,334
I said he was good, right?

796
00:38:26,751 --> 00:38:27,876
Ha ha, wait for me, wait!

797
00:38:27,876 --> 00:38:28,876
Okay

798
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:32,084
What a stuntman.

799
00:38:35,001 --> 00:38:38,209
Hey Wax, lookin' good!

800
00:38:38,209 --> 00:38:39,626
You guys are dead meat.

801
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:44,292
Hey, big guy.

802
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:45,959
Nice job with the fighting.

803
00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:46,834
It was okay.

804
00:38:46,834 --> 00:38:47,751
So I'm thinking,

805
00:38:47,751 --> 00:38:49,876
let's have you do a couple more takes,

806
00:38:49,876 --> 00:38:51,417
but with your mask a little higher.

807
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:52,292
Go ahead and cover your whole face.

808
00:38:52,292 --> 00:38:53,209
Best not to see your face at all.

809
00:38:53,209 --> 00:38:55,084
How'll they know it's me
if my face is covered?

810
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,334
You see that guy over there?

811
00:38:59,751 --> 00:39:01,126
Why is he wearing the same clothes as me?

812
00:39:01,126 --> 00:39:02,917
Because you're his stunt double.

813
00:39:02,917 --> 00:39:04,042
What's going on inside your head?

814
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:05,542
What do you mean? Huh?

815
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:07,167
Hey, sorry.

816
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:08,917
Your friend said that you can do anything.

817
00:39:11,292 --> 00:39:12,209
See, the thing is

818
00:39:12,709 --> 00:39:15,959
you were supposed to jump from here.

819
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:18,751
But you looked scared.

820
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:21,959
No, I wasn't scared.

821
00:39:24,001 --> 00:39:25,792
But your fighting was great.

822
00:39:25,792 --> 00:39:26,709
Yeah.

823
00:39:26,709 --> 00:39:28,876
You're gonna have to pay
for all the stuntmen you hurt.

824
00:39:28,876 --> 00:39:29,667
You

825
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:31,542
No, no, forget about the bill.

826
00:39:31,542 --> 00:39:33,917
Let's break for dinner.

827
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:35,584
Dinner time!

828
00:39:35,584 --> 00:39:38,584
William, let's eat first.

829
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:42,209
So, can you do a few more takes for us?

830
00:39:42,209 --> 00:39:43,001
Okay

831
00:39:44,084 --> 00:39:45,542
Let me go eat first.

832
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:46,542
Okay.

833
00:39:50,334 --> 00:39:52,459
Hey, dance or no?

834
00:39:52,459 --> 00:39:54,292
Wait for the shrimp vendor's music.

835
00:40:01,251 --> 00:40:04,334
<i>Money is hard to make,</i>

836
00:40:04,334 --> 00:40:07,959
<i>but for the ones we love</i>

837
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:09,959
<i>we go out to sea and work hard.</i>

838
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:11,667
When was I out at sea?

839
00:40:11,667 --> 00:40:15,334
<i>Is that really what we're fighting for.</i>

840
00:40:15,334 --> 00:40:18,334
<i>Money is hard to make,</i>

841
00:40:18,334 --> 00:40:19,126
<i>Hard to make.</i>

842
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:22,251
<i>And we work so hard.</i>

843
00:40:22,251 --> 00:40:22,751
<i>Work so hard.</i>

844
00:40:22,751 --> 00:40:26,459
<i>Just to see the ones we love.</i>

845
00:40:26,459 --> 00:40:30,334
<i>There is nothing we won't do...</i>

846
00:40:30,334 --> 00:40:32,334
<i>Nothing we won't do</i>

847
00:40:32,709 --> 00:40:34,667
Hey, that's enough, guys.

848
00:40:36,959 --> 00:40:38,917
Wax, are you still pissed?

849
00:40:41,751 --> 00:40:42,667
Nah.

850
00:40:43,751 --> 00:40:45,334
The three of you are nuts.

851
00:40:45,334 --> 00:40:47,792
You know I almost drowned before.
Whose idea was it?

852
00:40:47,792 --> 00:40:49,667
All right, Egg, admit it.

853
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:50,251
Come on, say you're sorry.

854
00:40:50,251 --> 00:40:51,251
You want me to make egg drop soup?

855
00:40:51,251 --> 00:40:53,126
Hey, it was your idea.

856
00:40:53,126 --> 00:40:54,667
All right, stop fighting.

857
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:56,792
Well it couldn't have been me.

858
00:40:56,792 --> 00:40:58,251
All right, all right, it was me.

859
00:40:58,251 --> 00:40:59,126
It was just a joke.

860
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:00,334
Why are you so upset?

861
00:41:00,334 --> 00:41:01,542
It was embarrassing.

862
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,042
Do I look like a stunt double?

863
00:41:04,042 --> 00:41:04,959
You did really well.

864
00:41:05,709 --> 00:41:06,626
Hello, sister-in-law.

865
00:41:08,251 --> 00:41:09,459
Try saying that again.

866
00:41:09,459 --> 00:41:11,334
Why do you always have to embarrass me?

867
00:41:11,334 --> 00:41:12,417
It wasn't embarrassing.

868
00:41:12,417 --> 00:41:14,542
You did Well.

869
00:41:15,459 --> 00:41:17,001
Did you see that?

870
00:41:17,584 --> 00:41:20,167
These are my friends.
You saw them the other day.

871
00:41:20,167 --> 00:41:22,417
They're a pack of idiots, ha ha.

872
00:41:23,459 --> 00:41:23,959
Who's an idiot?

873
00:41:23,959 --> 00:41:24,959
They don't look like idiots.

874
00:41:24,959 --> 00:41:26,084
Of course we don't look like idiots.

875
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:26,667
Yeah.

876
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:27,751
You guys are funny.

877
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,501
We're a lot of fun, too.

878
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:30,834
We're going bowling tomorrow.

879
00:41:30,834 --> 00:41:31,584
Wanna join us?

880
00:41:32,709 --> 00:41:34,751
Oh, I have a recording session tomorrow.

881
00:41:35,751 --> 00:41:36,584
A recording session?

882
00:41:36,584 --> 00:41:37,834
Oh, a recording!

883
00:41:37,834 --> 00:41:40,501
Yeah, we all like music too.

884
00:41:41,084 --> 00:41:42,126
Where's the recording session?

885
00:41:42,126 --> 00:41:43,167
Uh-

886
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,334
Hey, relax.

887
00:41:44,334 --> 00:41:45,959
We're nice guys.

888
00:41:47,876 --> 00:41:50,001
It's the recording studio near the traffic circle.

889
00:41:50,001 --> 00:41:51,084
Li-Feng Recording studio?

890
00:41:51,292 --> 00:41:51,751
Yes.

891
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:54,209
Starling, I went to your trailer

892
00:41:54,209 --> 00:41:56,126
and your dad said you were here.

893
00:41:57,709 --> 00:42:01,001
Hey big guy, you fought well.

894
00:42:04,292 --> 00:42:06,917
So about tomorrow's recording,

895
00:42:06,917 --> 00:42:09,376
I've finished my part already.

896
00:42:09,376 --> 00:42:11,959
As for your part, do your best.

897
00:42:11,959 --> 00:42:12,834
This is an important track for you.

898
00:42:12,834 --> 00:42:14,376
What the. ...?

899
00:42:14,376 --> 00:42:16,751
Your girl is taken, that's what.

900
00:42:16,751 --> 00:42:18,459
The shrimp roll guy is still open.

901
00:42:39,959 --> 00:42:41,792
Oops. Let's pick it up.

902
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:42,751
There you go.

903
00:42:45,292 --> 00:42:47,167
Was that six knocks or seven?

904
00:42:47,709 --> 00:42:48,417
Who is it?

905
00:42:49,334 --> 00:42:51,626
Hey it's me, what's up?

906
00:42:51,626 --> 00:42:53,334
Just babysitting Jasmine's kid.

907
00:42:53,334 --> 00:42:54,626
Babysitting?

908
00:42:54,626 --> 00:42:55,667
Her friend came to visit.

909
00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:58,251
So she left her kid at my place.

910
00:42:58,251 --> 00:43:01,042
You'd make a pretty good babysitter.

911
00:43:01,042 --> 00:43:03,126
If A-Lang looked after the kid

912
00:43:03,126 --> 00:43:05,751
he'd be scared by all that hair.

913
00:43:09,917 --> 00:43:10,459
Let me ask you something.

914
00:43:10,459 --> 00:43:10,959
Okay.

915
00:43:12,626 --> 00:43:13,876
If there were two guys

916
00:43:13,876 --> 00:43:16,042
and one was a movie star

917
00:43:16,042 --> 00:43:17,376
who had everything,

918
00:43:17,376 --> 00:43:19,876
and the other guy was just an average guy

919
00:43:19,876 --> 00:43:22,626
He's not exactly rich, but he has a rich life.

920
00:43:22,626 --> 00:43:25,792
If you were a girl, who'd you pick?

921
00:43:25,792 --> 00:43:27,167
Me?

922
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:30,042
The rich guy.

923
00:43:30,042 --> 00:43:31,459
Who asked you, A-Lang?

924
00:43:31,459 --> 00:43:33,209
Of course I'd go for the guy with money.

925
00:43:33,209 --> 00:43:34,876
Who'd pick the loser?

926
00:43:34,876 --> 00:43:37,542
Having money's great. You can do anything.

927
00:43:37,542 --> 00:43:39,834
Hey, are you from the Rooftop or not?

928
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:43,501
I was just quoting Egg.

929
00:43:45,167 --> 00:43:46,792
Tell Egg to come and listen.

930
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,751
I am listening.

931
00:43:50,084 --> 00:43:51,834
What've you been saying, silly Egg?

932
00:43:52,584 --> 00:43:53,959
Hey, Wax-

933
00:43:53,959 --> 00:43:55,626
try not to worry about it.

934
00:43:55,626 --> 00:43:56,751
If it's meant to be, it's meant to be.

935
00:43:56,751 --> 00:43:58,209
If it's not, then it's not.

936
00:43:59,542 --> 00:44:02,584
Hey Egg, that actually makes a lot of sense.

937
00:44:02,584 --> 00:44:03,459
Wax.

938
00:44:03,459 --> 00:44:05,209
Shall I take you to Dr. Bo

939
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:06,792
to heal your lovesickness?

940
00:44:06,792 --> 00:44:08,459
You guys are idiots.

941
00:44:08,459 --> 00:44:09,834
Go to bed.

942
00:44:12,126 --> 00:44:13,751
Idiots.

943
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:27,334
<i>The sky darkens with the passing clouds.</i>

944
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:31,709
<i>The waves roll quietly in the soft wind.</i>

945
00:44:31,709 --> 00:44:36,917
<i>Though you're far away,
you've made me so happy.</i>

946
00:44:43,209 --> 00:44:44,542
Starling, wait a minute.

947
00:44:48,084 --> 00:44:50,126
What are you guys doing here?

948
00:44:55,876 --> 00:44:58,209
Judging from your outfit,

949
00:44:58,209 --> 00:45:00,751
I'd say you're the guitarist.

950
00:45:00,751 --> 00:45:02,001
Uh-huh.

951
00:45:02,001 --> 00:45:03,834
The guy that looks like broccoli?
The drummer.

952
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:05,584
Plus two backup singers.

953
00:45:05,584 --> 00:45:07,292
We're just visiting.

954
00:45:07,292 --> 00:45:09,667
I thought the band was coming tomorrow.

955
00:45:17,209 --> 00:45:17,959
Starling,

956
00:45:17,959 --> 00:45:20,876
Let's pick up from where we stopped.

957
00:45:21,167 --> 00:45:23,126
Wow, so fancy.

958
00:45:23,126 --> 00:45:25,751
Hey, no shoes inside the studio.

959
00:45:25,751 --> 00:45:27,751
Yeah, no shoes.

960
00:45:28,751 --> 00:45:30,376
He meant no flip-flops, either.

961
00:45:30,876 --> 00:45:32,876
Sorry, but we haven't washed our feet lately.

962
00:45:34,459 --> 00:45:36,126
All right, fine.

963
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:40,417
Starling, let's take it from the top.

964
00:45:48,834 --> 00:45:50,917
She sure is pretty,

965
00:45:50,917 --> 00:45:53,792
but her singing is a little...

966
00:45:54,917 --> 00:45:55,751
A little what?

967
00:45:57,626 --> 00:45:59,167
Natural.

968
00:45:59,709 --> 00:46:01,084
Yeah

969
00:46:02,001 --> 00:46:05,542
Hey, wait a second.

970
00:46:06,042 --> 00:46:07,167
What is it?

971
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:08,876
Are we too loud?

972
00:46:08,876 --> 00:46:10,709
It's none of your business.

973
00:46:10,709 --> 00:46:11,959
Hey Starling,

974
00:46:11,959 --> 00:46:15,042
I feel like something was missing just now.

975
00:46:15,042 --> 00:46:16,751
What does that mean?

976
00:46:16,751 --> 00:46:18,209
I think it's great.

977
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:20,709
Hmmph. What do you know?

978
00:46:20,709 --> 00:46:22,459
What I'm looking for is a feeling

979
00:46:22,459 --> 00:46:24,709
that's sad, but not too sad.

980
00:46:24,959 --> 00:46:27,709
You want to be happy, but can't be.

981
00:46:28,001 --> 00:46:29,001
What are you going on about?

982
00:46:29,084 --> 00:46:29,584
Huh?

983
00:46:31,042 --> 00:46:32,459
Can she hear us?

984
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:34,126
Not unless I press this button.

985
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:34,834
Okay.

986
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,376
I'm the one who's unhappy.

987
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:37,501
Hey-

988
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:38,917
Wax, don't be impulsive.

989
00:46:38,917 --> 00:46:39,542
Right.

990
00:46:39,876 --> 00:46:40,417
It's you.

991
00:46:40,584 --> 00:46:42,417
All your talk is upsetting my bro.

992
00:46:42,417 --> 00:46:44,834
She can't hear you, but she can still see you.

993
00:46:45,001 --> 00:46:46,001
Oh, ha ha.

994
00:46:49,376 --> 00:46:50,334
Sit down.

995
00:46:51,292 --> 00:46:52,959
Press the button for me.

996
00:46:54,626 --> 00:46:56,626
Starling, this time

997
00:46:56,626 --> 00:46:58,376
I want you to give me

998
00:46:58,376 --> 00:47:00,334
sad, but not too sad

999
00:47:00,334 --> 00:47:01,834
and happy, but-

1000
00:47:01,834 --> 00:47:03,417
not yet really happy. Something like that.

1001
00:47:03,417 --> 00:47:04,751
Isn't that what I just said?

1002
00:47:05,959 --> 00:47:07,751
Okay, Starling, let's do it again.

1003
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,126
Wait, who's that guy singing?

1004
00:47:18,417 --> 00:47:19,709
It's the lead actor.

1005
00:47:20,001 --> 00:47:21,751
Is he in there too?

1006
00:47:21,751 --> 00:47:22,834
Where is he?

1007
00:47:23,167 --> 00:47:26,084
We recorded it already.
Are you guys really musicians?

1008
00:47:43,751 --> 00:47:45,209
Bye-bye

1009
00:47:45,376 --> 00:47:46,792
Hey, are you-

1010
00:47:46,792 --> 00:47:48,126
Are you leaving?

1011
00:47:49,292 --> 00:47:51,542
Yeah, you guys were sleeping

1012
00:47:51,542 --> 00:47:52,417
and I didn't want to wake you up.

1013
00:47:52,417 --> 00:47:53,667
No, they were sleeping, I was awake.

1014
00:47:53,667 --> 00:47:55,959
Did you just "fall" for the girl?

1015
00:47:56,251 --> 00:47:57,459
Starling, how could you do that?

1016
00:47:57,459 --> 00:47:58,542
How could you leave without us?

1017
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,417
Are you hungry?

1018
00:47:59,417 --> 00:48:01,001
Let us take you out to eat.

1019
00:48:01,001 --> 00:48:02,209
Eat?

1020
00:48:02,917 --> 00:48:05,292
But I don't even know your names.

1021
00:48:05,709 --> 00:48:08,001
My name's Wax, and the others don't matter.

1022
00:48:08,001 --> 00:48:09,584
Hi I'm Egg.

1023
00:48:10,251 --> 00:48:11,251
Tempura

1024
00:48:11,917 --> 00:48:13,167
Broccoli

1025
00:48:13,709 --> 00:48:15,584
All food? You guys are funny.

1026
00:48:15,709 --> 00:48:17,792
You should spend more time with

1027
00:48:17,792 --> 00:48:20,167
ordinary people before you become a star

1028
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:21,126
otherwise you'll wish you'd

1029
00:48:21,126 --> 00:48:22,334
savored the joys of everyday life.

1030
00:48:22,334 --> 00:48:24,751
What do you mean? She's already famous.

1031
00:48:24,751 --> 00:48:26,584
No, I'm really not.

1032
00:48:26,584 --> 00:48:29,251
You're not a star? Then come with us.

1033
00:48:29,251 --> 00:48:30,376
Uh-

1034
00:48:41,792 --> 00:48:44,417
It'll be dark when I get there.

1035
00:48:44,917 --> 00:48:48,542
Don't rush, you'll have to wait for me anyway.

1036
00:48:55,542 --> 00:48:58,792
<i>The night market</i>

1037
00:48:58,792 --> 00:49:01,626
<i>is the place to be.</i>

1038
00:49:03,459 --> 00:49:05,376
<i>Come on everybody.</i>

1039
00:49:05,376 --> 00:49:06,542
Thirty cents a go, everyone wins!

1040
00:49:06,876 --> 00:49:11,334
<i>We'll be happy together.</i>

1041
00:49:11,334 --> 00:49:14,542
<i>I'll never forget</i>

1042
00:49:14,542 --> 00:49:18,751
<i>roasting corn with you</i>

1043
00:49:18,751 --> 00:49:22,667
<i>and catching goldfish with you</i>

1044
00:49:22,667 --> 00:49:27,959
<i>a bittersweet love.</i>

1045
00:49:32,042 --> 00:49:35,542
What a wonderful place.
I've never been here.

1046
00:49:35,542 --> 00:49:37,751
I told you, it's fun, right?

1047
00:49:37,751 --> 00:49:40,959
Let's see if anyone recognizes her.

1048
00:49:45,501 --> 00:49:48,001
What are you staring at?

1049
00:49:49,501 --> 00:49:50,251
Let's go.

1050
00:49:51,959 --> 00:49:54,001
Hi Tempura

1051
00:49:54,001 --> 00:49:54,876
Hey Jiang

1052
00:49:54,876 --> 00:49:58,792
Are you the girl on the billboard?

1053
00:50:01,042 --> 00:50:02,126
Sorry, I didn't catch your name.

1054
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:04,167
You need to wear these at the night market.

1055
00:50:04,417 --> 00:50:05,459
That's what all the stars do.

1056
00:50:05,459 --> 00:50:07,917
I told you she's a star.

1057
00:50:08,251 --> 00:50:09,959
But a star without a name.

1058
00:50:09,959 --> 00:50:12,251
Put them on so people won't recognize you.

1059
00:50:12,251 --> 00:50:13,126
That's not a bad idea.

1060
00:50:13,126 --> 00:50:14,667
Jiang, credit my account, ck?

1061
00:50:14,667 --> 00:50:15,751
Huh?

1062
00:50:15,751 --> 00:50:16,917
No, you don't have to do that.

1063
00:50:16,917 --> 00:50:17,917
Yeah, you don't have to do that.

1064
00:50:17,917 --> 00:50:19,251
It's okay, we're good friends.

1065
00:50:19,251 --> 00:50:21,042
Yes, yes, yes...

1066
00:50:24,917 --> 00:50:26,251
Looks great.

1067
00:50:27,126 --> 00:50:28,417
No it doesn't.

1068
00:50:28,417 --> 00:50:29,459
Shut up.

1069
00:50:29,876 --> 00:50:31,292
I'm so hungry.

1070
00:50:31,292 --> 00:50:32,917
What shall we eat?

1071
00:50:33,584 --> 00:50:34,709
What do you wanna eat?

1072
00:50:34,709 --> 00:50:36,251
BBQ sausages!

1073
00:50:36,251 --> 00:50:38,292
You can love em' and leave em'

1074
00:50:38,292 --> 00:50:39,334
you can fling em' about.

1075
00:50:39,334 --> 00:50:40,751
You can travel the world
but please don't miss out

1076
00:50:40,751 --> 00:50:43,001
Come take a look, come give 'em a try.

1077
00:50:43,001 --> 00:50:44,667
Our clothes are so hot, you'll look really fly.

1078
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:45,542
Once you try this brand name

1079
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,542
Then life won't be the same.

1080
00:50:48,501 --> 00:50:52,292
Aiyah, it's a superstar!

1081
00:50:52,584 --> 00:50:53,334
Hey!

1082
00:50:55,709 --> 00:50:57,292
A superstar would never

1083
00:50:57,292 --> 00:50:58,751
come to a place like this

1084
00:50:58,751 --> 00:51:01,209
cause this is a place for average people,
ha ha.

1085
00:51:01,209 --> 00:51:03,376
Hello everyone!

1086
00:51:03,376 --> 00:51:06,459
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're delighted to have you!

1087
00:51:06,459 --> 00:51:07,126
How about

1088
00:51:07,126 --> 00:51:10,292
a rousing song of welcome?

1089
00:51:10,292 --> 00:51:11,542
Ha ha, here we go!

1090
00:51:17,292 --> 00:51:19,959
<i>Come, come!</i>

1091
00:51:19,959 --> 00:51:22,292
<i>Welcome to the most passionate island
on the planet.</i>

1092
00:51:22,292 --> 00:51:23,751
<i>Hajiu, hajiu, hajiu</i>

1093
00:51:23,751 --> 00:51:25,626
<i>The Lovers' Lake Night Market!</i>

1094
00:51:25,626 --> 00:51:27,959
<i>The Lovers' Lake</i>

1095
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:28,917
<i>Night Market.</i>

1096
00:51:28,917 --> 00:51:30,251
<i>Hajiu, hajiu, hajiu</i>

1097
00:51:30,251 --> 00:51:35,209
<i>Oh, beautiful lady.</i>

1098
00:51:35,209 --> 00:51:38,417
<i>Welcome to The Lovers' Lake.</i>

1099
00:51:38,417 --> 00:51:41,459
<i>I promise you won't want to go home.</i>

1100
00:51:41,459 --> 00:51:43,167
<i>Hajiu, hajiu, hajiu</i>

1101
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:48,084
<i>Take a walk around the island.</i>

1102
00:51:48,084 --> 00:51:51,251
<i>There's food, games, and handsome men.</i>

1103
00:51:51,251 --> 00:51:54,251
<i>Take home whichever one you like!</i>

1104
00:51:54,251 --> 00:51:55,751
<i>Hajiu, hajiu, hajiu</i>

1105
00:51:55,751 --> 00:51:56,959
<i>Which one do you like?</i>

1106
00:51:56,959 --> 00:51:57,667
<i>Hajiu</i>

1107
00:51:57,667 --> 00:51:58,667
<i>Which one do you like?</i>

1108
00:51:58,667 --> 00:51:59,209
<i>Hajiu</i>

1109
00:51:59,209 --> 00:52:00,251
<i>Which one do you like?</i>

1110
00:52:00,251 --> 00:52:02,376
<i>Hajiu, hajiu, hajiu</i>

1111
00:52:02,376 --> 00:52:03,501
<i>I'm not a handsome guy.</i>

1112
00:52:03,501 --> 00:52:03,917
<i>Hajiu</i>

1113
00:52:03,917 --> 00:52:05,084
<i>But at least I know how to sing.</i>

1114
00:52:05,084 --> 00:52:05,542
<i>Hajiu</i>

1115
00:52:05,542 --> 00:52:06,667
<i>So, choose me!</i>

1116
00:52:06,667 --> 00:52:07,834
<i>Hajiu, hajiu, hajiu</i>

1117
00:52:11,917 --> 00:52:14,209
I hope you all have a great time!

1118
00:52:14,459 --> 00:52:16,792
Starling, let's go fishing down at the lake.

1119
00:52:16,792 --> 00:52:18,334
But you can catch goldfish here.

1120
00:52:18,334 --> 00:52:20,209
Really? Where?

1121
00:52:20,876 --> 00:52:21,792
Yeah.

1122
00:52:21,792 --> 00:52:22,542
Over there-

1123
00:52:22,542 --> 00:52:24,209
Oh, I see.

1124
00:52:24,209 --> 00:52:26,542
I wanna play too.

1125
00:52:26,542 --> 00:52:29,126
Why don't you go fish for bottles?

1126
00:52:29,126 --> 00:52:30,042
Leave the goldfish to us.

1127
00:52:30,042 --> 00:52:31,251
Let's go.

1128
00:52:31,251 --> 00:52:32,042
Hey-

1129
00:52:32,292 --> 00:52:34,376
Wow, what's going on here?

1130
00:52:35,876 --> 00:52:39,751
Is this your first time at Lovers' Lake?

1131
00:52:40,251 --> 00:52:43,251
I've got two stands,
one for clothes and one for fish.

1132
00:52:43,251 --> 00:52:45,501
Having two wives isn't easy.

1133
00:52:45,501 --> 00:52:47,626
Oh, by the way, there's a tradition.

1134
00:52:47,626 --> 00:52:50,542
If lovers catch a pair of fish

1135
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,334
and set them free in Lovers' Lake

1136
00:52:52,334 --> 00:52:55,709
they'll have a beautiful life together.

1137
00:52:55,709 --> 00:52:57,584
We're just friends.

1138
00:52:59,917 --> 00:53:02,167
You'll be lovers after you're done fishing.

1139
00:53:12,501 --> 00:53:14,042
Almost, almost, come on.

1140
00:53:14,042 --> 00:53:15,334
Tempura, something's wrong.

1141
00:53:15,334 --> 00:53:16,251
What's wrong?

1142
00:53:17,792 --> 00:53:18,834
Wax-

1143
00:53:21,751 --> 00:53:23,459
Hold on a sec,
I'm gonna get something to eat.

1144
00:53:25,251 --> 00:53:28,084
I thought Tempura was collecting rent.

1145
00:53:28,084 --> 00:53:30,126
He said we could have a couple more days.

1146
00:53:33,626 --> 00:53:35,334
Tempura said that?

1147
00:53:35,834 --> 00:53:37,459
I'm in charge now.

1148
00:53:37,751 --> 00:53:39,751
Roman, don't get mad.

1149
00:53:40,042 --> 00:53:42,292
We'll pay you next time, I promise.

1150
00:53:44,292 --> 00:53:45,376
Get up.

1151
00:53:47,084 --> 00:53:49,834
Roman, Roman, what are you doing?

1152
00:53:50,584 --> 00:53:52,626
Showing you who's boss.

1153
00:53:52,626 --> 00:53:54,584
Can't you see?

1154
00:53:54,584 --> 00:53:57,167
Rango will be pissed.

1155
00:53:57,167 --> 00:53:58,626
If they can't pay,

1156
00:53:58,626 --> 00:54:00,792
then they get punished.

1157
00:54:00,792 --> 00:54:02,501
This is my district.

1158
00:54:02,501 --> 00:54:05,459
Boss, how many sausages do I get?

1159
00:54:05,584 --> 00:54:06,959
Are you really buying sausages?

1160
00:54:07,126 --> 00:54:08,459
You're a dead man.

1161
00:54:09,667 --> 00:54:10,792
Wait,

1162
00:54:10,792 --> 00:54:13,751
how about a song before I die?

1163
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:14,792
La~

1164
00:54:14,792 --> 00:54:16,334
Don't you "la" me.

1165
00:54:17,126 --> 00:54:18,626
When the dice stop spinning

1166
00:54:18,626 --> 00:54:20,626
you'll all be on the ground.

1167
00:54:42,501 --> 00:54:45,292
Is it delicious? Yeah? ls it good?

1168
00:55:08,667 --> 00:55:11,001
Next time, remember my bro Wax.

1169
00:55:11,001 --> 00:55:12,584
Ah, man.

1170
00:55:12,584 --> 00:55:14,251
Bad luck again.

1171
00:55:14,251 --> 00:55:15,751
You think you're hot shit?

1172
00:55:16,167 --> 00:55:19,084
Big Red is coming soon,
and you'll all be dead.

1173
00:55:19,334 --> 00:55:20,209
Big Red?

1174
00:55:20,209 --> 00:55:20,959
Hey

1175
00:55:21,126 --> 00:55:22,667
Whose afraid of Big Red?

1176
00:55:23,417 --> 00:55:24,126
Starling

1177
00:55:24,334 --> 00:55:24,917
Starling

1178
00:55:32,417 --> 00:55:33,542
A-Lang, this way!

1179
00:55:34,042 --> 00:55:35,584
Egg, run!

1180
00:55:35,626 --> 00:55:36,334
Run, run, run!

1181
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:38,751
Hey, you didn't take your fish!

1182
00:55:40,959 --> 00:55:41,917
Where are they?

1183
00:55:41,959 --> 00:55:43,542
They took off.

1184
00:55:47,584 --> 00:55:49,501
Here, keep the change.

1185
00:55:49,542 --> 00:55:50,376
What's with the attitude?

1186
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:51,417
Outta the way!

1187
00:55:56,126 --> 00:55:57,209
Watch out!

1188
00:56:01,459 --> 00:56:02,876
Faster!

1189
00:56:03,751 --> 00:56:04,626
They're coming!

1190
00:56:07,792 --> 00:56:09,501
Stop!

1191
00:56:10,501 --> 00:56:12,834
I said kick some ass,

1192
00:56:12,834 --> 00:56:14,542
not get your ass kicked.

1193
00:56:15,459 --> 00:56:16,959
Sorry, boss.

1194
00:56:17,167 --> 00:56:20,292
Boss, that looked like a famous actress.

1195
00:56:24,584 --> 00:56:25,584
Go to the night market and find out.

1196
00:56:25,626 --> 00:56:26,167
Yes sir.

1197
00:56:26,209 --> 00:56:27,334
Go.

1198
00:56:28,792 --> 00:56:31,126
Who are they, why are they chasing you?

1199
00:56:31,167 --> 00:56:32,292
A-Lang owes them money.

1200
00:56:32,501 --> 00:56:34,459
He owes them a lot.

1201
00:56:34,501 --> 00:56:35,334
Who said my name?

1202
00:56:35,376 --> 00:56:37,126
Nobody, keep driving.

1203
00:56:37,167 --> 00:56:37,709
Oh.

1204
00:56:38,917 --> 00:56:45,501
<i>Hurry up my little swan, hurry, hurry!</i>

1205
00:56:45,501 --> 00:56:46,917
Hurry UP!

1206
00:56:47,126 --> 00:56:47,834
<i>Faster!</i>

1207
00:56:48,959 --> 00:56:53,459
<i>Take us home, please.</i>

1208
00:57:08,959 --> 00:57:10,751
You guys live in the Rooftop district?

1209
00:57:12,292 --> 00:57:13,626
My dad says

1210
00:57:15,292 --> 00:57:17,584
it's a bit rough up there.

1211
00:57:17,626 --> 00:57:19,626
No, people in the Rooftop District

1212
00:57:19,667 --> 00:57:21,834
are cultural and artistic people.

1213
00:57:21,876 --> 00:57:23,042
Yeah.

1214
00:57:23,417 --> 00:57:25,001
But if your heart is troubled,

1215
00:57:25,876 --> 00:57:29,417
then the whole world seems rough.

1216
00:57:29,667 --> 00:57:30,709
What are you going on about?

1217
00:57:30,709 --> 00:57:33,167
Wow, you're so sophisticated.

1218
00:57:33,209 --> 00:57:35,209
Hey, she said you're sophisticated.

1219
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:35,959
Can't tell by looking.

1220
00:57:36,001 --> 00:57:36,584
You really can't tell.

1221
00:57:36,626 --> 00:57:38,542
But I'll show you someone who does look it.

1222
00:57:38,584 --> 00:57:39,459
Ah?

1223
00:57:40,751 --> 00:57:41,667
Ready?

1224
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,792
Hello, sister-in-law!

1225
00:57:44,334 --> 00:57:45,167
Don't listen to their nonsense.

1226
00:57:45,209 --> 00:57:48,209
Because we can see you everyday.

1227
00:57:48,251 --> 00:57:49,876
You just can't see us.

1228
00:57:49,917 --> 00:57:51,959
Nonsense.

1229
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:53,501
So, you see us every day, right?

1230
00:57:53,542 --> 00:57:55,084
No, I mean we see you every day.

1231
00:57:55,084 --> 00:57:55,792
So we've known you for a long time.

1232
00:57:55,834 --> 00:57:57,959
But you hadn't met us yet.

1233
00:57:58,001 --> 00:58:00,251
Nonsense again.

1234
00:58:01,292 --> 00:58:05,209
Soto us, you're like our sister.

1235
00:58:05,251 --> 00:58:06,876
What are we talking about?

1236
00:58:07,209 --> 00:58:09,501
Then why "sister-in-law"?

1237
00:58:09,542 --> 00:58:11,584
Because, because, um...

1238
00:58:11,626 --> 00:58:13,251
You'll find out if you come upstairs with us.

1239
00:58:14,459 --> 00:58:15,626
You know something,

1240
00:58:15,667 --> 00:58:17,876
Wax doesn't bring just anybody up there.

1241
00:58:17,917 --> 00:58:20,292
It's a lot of fun up there.

1242
00:58:20,334 --> 00:58:20,834
Come in-

1243
00:58:20,876 --> 00:58:22,417
It's a lot of fun.

1244
00:58:29,251 --> 00:58:30,376
Yay!

1245
00:58:30,376 --> 00:58:31,251
Bye-bye, Wax.

1246
00:58:40,667 --> 00:58:41,959
Outta the way!

1247
00:58:42,459 --> 00:58:43,459
What are you doing?

1248
00:58:43,584 --> 00:58:44,584
Come on.

1249
00:58:46,126 --> 00:58:46,917
See, I told you.

1250
00:58:46,959 --> 00:58:48,417
We are cultural and artistic people.

1251
00:58:48,459 --> 00:58:50,251
Guitar music as soon as you arrive.

1252
00:58:52,251 --> 00:58:55,709
Cat got your tongue?
If you can't say it, sing it.

1253
00:58:55,751 --> 00:58:57,459
Oh, right.

1254
00:59:00,584 --> 00:59:02,084
<i>Hey, newbie.</i>

1255
00:59:02,126 --> 00:59:04,751
<i>You're not THAT person, are you?</i>

1256
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:05,959
<i>Take a wild guess.</i>

1257
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:08,376
<i>I think I've mistaken you for someone else</i>

1258
00:59:08,417 --> 00:59:10,126
<i>Because I can't believe the beauty</i>

1259
00:59:10,126 --> 00:59:14,334
<i>I see in front of me.</i>

1260
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:16,251
You are so sweet.

1261
00:59:16,417 --> 00:59:17,917
<i>Forget them.</i>

1262
00:59:17,917 --> 00:59:20,459
<i>Hurry and come with me.</i>

1263
00:59:20,459 --> 00:59:21,667
<i>Come and enjoy</i>

1264
00:59:21,667 --> 00:59:24,209
<i>this beautiful night scenery.</i>

1265
00:59:24,209 --> 00:59:25,751
<i>No matter how beautiful this rooftop is</i>

1266
00:59:25,792 --> 00:59:30,709
<i>it will never be as beautiful as your smile.</i>

1267
00:59:32,167 --> 00:59:34,501
<i>Shoo-bee-doo-wa</i>

1268
00:59:34,542 --> 00:59:36,751
<i>I wish time could pause just for a moment.</i>

1269
00:59:36,792 --> 00:59:38,209
<i>What did you say?</i>

1270
00:59:38,251 --> 00:59:40,376
<i>I didn't say anything.</i>

1271
00:59:40,417 --> 00:59:42,209
<i>Shoo-bee-doo-wa</i>

1272
00:59:42,251 --> 00:59:46,501
<i>What are you being all shy about?</i>

1273
00:59:49,834 --> 00:59:51,042
<i>His name is "Chocolate.”</i>

1274
00:59:51,084 --> 00:59:53,709
<i>Do you like chocolate?</i>

1275
00:59:53,751 --> 00:59:55,167
<i>No, not really.</i>

1276
00:59:55,209 --> 00:59:57,584
<i>Step aside, who asked you.</i>

1277
00:59:57,626 --> 00:59:58,834
<i>Now I'm certain</i>

1278
00:59:58,834 --> 01:00:05,209
<i>you're the star on that billboard.</i>

1279
01:00:05,209 --> 01:00:12,959
<i>Big star</i>

1280
01:00:18,167 --> 01:00:21,126
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

1281
01:00:22,876 --> 01:00:24,876
Yes, yes.

1282
01:00:24,917 --> 01:00:26,459
This is my friend Starling.

1283
01:00:27,459 --> 01:00:28,834
My Rooftop friends,

1284
01:00:28,876 --> 01:00:30,126
do me a favor

1285
01:00:30,167 --> 01:00:31,584
and go back to your homes.

1286
01:00:31,626 --> 01:00:33,751
Or you'll make her nervous.

1287
01:00:33,792 --> 01:00:36,834
All right, that's enough staring.

1288
01:00:37,917 --> 01:00:38,792
I am so nervous.

1289
01:00:38,792 --> 01:00:39,584
Go on now.

1290
01:00:40,167 --> 01:00:40,959
What is it?

1291
01:00:41,001 --> 01:00:41,792
Superstar-

1292
01:00:41,834 --> 01:00:42,709
We are culturally rich

1293
01:00:42,751 --> 01:00:43,876
and decent people.

1294
01:00:43,917 --> 01:00:44,959
That's the third time.

1295
01:00:45,001 --> 01:00:45,876
Ah? ls it?

1296
01:00:45,917 --> 01:00:47,626
Hi, Jasmine.

1297
01:00:49,042 --> 01:00:50,417
She said "good job."

1298
01:00:50,459 --> 01:00:51,834
Let me introduce you to someone.

1299
01:00:52,959 --> 01:00:54,042
Over here.

1300
01:00:55,667 --> 01:00:56,751
Jasmine, Jasmine

1301
01:00:56,792 --> 01:00:58,042
Did you hear us singing?

1302
01:00:58,834 --> 01:01:00,126
Hi, Starling.

1303
01:01:00,126 --> 01:01:01,251
Hi. This is Jasmine.

1304
01:01:01,251 --> 01:01:02,251
How are you, Jasmine?

1305
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:02,917
Good, good

1306
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:04,084
She raised us since we were kids.

1307
01:01:04,126 --> 01:01:05,667
And she's a fantastic cook.

1308
01:01:05,667 --> 01:01:06,292
World-class, world-class.

1309
01:01:06,292 --> 01:01:07,459
No, it's just home cooking.

1310
01:01:07,501 --> 01:01:08,834
Her home cooking

1311
01:01:08,876 --> 01:01:12,626
is better than all the top
restaurants in Galilee.

1312
01:01:12,667 --> 01:01:14,292
Although I've never been to one.

1313
01:01:14,334 --> 01:01:15,959
If you've never been to one,
how do you know?

1314
01:01:16,001 --> 01:01:16,667
Really delicious.

1315
01:01:16,709 --> 01:01:18,042
All right, all right.

1316
01:01:18,084 --> 01:01:20,501
So, superstar, what brought you here?

1317
01:01:22,126 --> 01:01:23,292
Oh Jasmine,

1318
01:01:23,334 --> 01:01:24,126
we wanted to show Starling

1319
01:01:24,167 --> 01:01:27,042
how cultured and artistic
we are on the Rooftop.

1320
01:01:27,084 --> 01:01:28,334
The fourth time.

1321
01:01:28,376 --> 01:01:29,792
Is it the fourth?

1322
01:01:29,834 --> 01:01:31,167
I've been asking Wax

1323
01:01:31,209 --> 01:01:33,334
to bring a girlfriend home but

1324
01:01:33,376 --> 01:01:35,251
I didn't expect you'd come so soon!

1325
01:01:35,292 --> 01:01:35,667
Yeah-

1326
01:01:35,709 --> 01:01:37,126
He always gets what he wants, lucky guy.

1327
01:01:37,167 --> 01:01:38,917
Jasmine, we're just friends.

1328
01:01:38,959 --> 01:01:39,834
Oh.

1329
01:01:39,876 --> 01:01:41,001
Still just friends now,

1330
01:01:41,042 --> 01:01:43,251
but who knows about tomorrow?

1331
01:01:44,876 --> 01:01:46,167
That's enough.

1332
01:01:47,084 --> 01:01:49,917
We Rooftop people are always joking around.

1333
01:01:49,959 --> 01:01:52,417
We're like a big family, don't mind us.

1334
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:53,417
I won't.

1335
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:55,251
But you're also part of the family

1336
01:01:55,751 --> 01:01:57,876
We see you every day.

1337
01:02:00,834 --> 01:02:03,001
I told you that you're like a sister.

1338
01:02:03,042 --> 01:02:04,751
Then why "sister-in-law"?

1339
01:02:05,209 --> 01:02:06,126
Uh-

1340
01:02:07,917 --> 01:02:09,917
You kids have fun, I'm gonna go make dinner.

1341
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:11,126
Let me help.

1342
01:02:11,167 --> 01:02:12,084
I wanna help too.

1343
01:02:12,126 --> 01:02:13,001
You can't cook.

1344
01:02:13,042 --> 01:02:15,417
Jasmine, I don't want potatoes tonight.

1345
01:02:15,459 --> 01:02:16,667
Your ass is grass.

1346
01:02:16,709 --> 01:02:18,209
Tempura, Tempura

1347
01:02:18,251 --> 01:02:19,834
Starling, it's noisy here.

1348
01:02:19,876 --> 01:02:21,876
Let me take you somewhere quieter.

1349
01:02:23,376 --> 01:02:24,334
Noisy?

1350
01:02:24,334 --> 01:02:25,126
It's too noisy?

1351
01:02:25,126 --> 01:02:27,417
It's very quiet here.

1352
01:02:27,459 --> 01:02:29,292
Ha ha

1353
01:02:29,334 --> 01:02:31,709
Wow, it's so beautiful.

1354
01:02:31,751 --> 01:02:33,042
I never knew there was a place like this

1355
01:02:33,084 --> 01:02:34,626
in Galilee.

1356
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:35,501
Of course.

1357
01:02:35,542 --> 01:02:36,459
This is the place on the Rooftop

1358
01:02:36,501 --> 01:02:38,876
that's closest to the stars.

1359
01:02:38,917 --> 01:02:42,126
Your wishes are more likely
to come true up here.

1360
01:02:42,167 --> 01:02:43,584
Really?

1361
01:02:43,626 --> 01:02:45,251
Yes.

1362
01:02:45,292 --> 01:02:47,542
That's how I got you up here.

1363
01:02:49,209 --> 01:02:51,251
That's not funny.

1364
01:02:52,876 --> 01:02:55,542
Hey, do you have a wish?

1365
01:02:57,667 --> 01:03:01,251
I wish my father would stop gambling,

1366
01:03:02,334 --> 01:03:04,167
and that I could make more money

1367
01:03:04,209 --> 01:03:05,792
so I could pay off my debt to William.

1368
01:03:05,834 --> 01:03:07,126
William?

1369
01:03:07,167 --> 01:03:09,751
That's why William's company signed me.

1370
01:03:10,709 --> 01:03:13,626
But he takes care of my father and me.

1371
01:03:14,709 --> 01:03:15,876
That's good, then.

1372
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:16,751
Otherwise-

1373
01:03:16,792 --> 01:03:18,251
What about you?

1374
01:03:18,876 --> 01:03:20,751
You look so carefree.

1375
01:03:21,584 --> 01:03:23,792
I envy you guys-

1376
01:03:23,834 --> 01:03:27,126
I wish I could be just be myself.

1377
01:03:27,626 --> 01:03:29,084
Like you Guys.

1378
01:03:31,667 --> 01:03:33,417
It's simple.

1379
01:03:33,459 --> 01:03:35,084
Depends on whether you want to be

1380
01:03:35,126 --> 01:03:36,792
the chess player or the pawn.

1381
01:03:36,834 --> 01:03:38,584
See, people on the Rooftop

1382
01:03:38,626 --> 01:03:39,584
are ordinary people

1383
01:03:39,626 --> 01:03:42,292
with extraordinary lives.

1384
01:03:42,334 --> 01:03:45,501
Yes, I can see that from the way you dress.

1385
01:03:47,001 --> 01:03:50,876
That's just an attitude towards life.

1386
01:03:53,167 --> 01:03:56,417
<i>Sister, go bravely forward...</i>

1387
01:03:56,542 --> 01:03:59,042
Hey what are you doing
playing that song now?

1388
01:03:59,042 --> 01:04:00,751
Sorry, I'll play a different song.

1389
01:04:32,084 --> 01:04:34,959
No matter what happened in the past,

1390
01:04:35,001 --> 01:04:37,917
it's fate that made us friends.

1391
01:04:37,959 --> 01:04:38,584
William-

1392
01:04:38,626 --> 01:04:40,667
If you want to take any of them home,

1393
01:04:40,709 --> 01:04:42,376
it's on the house, okay?

1394
01:04:42,417 --> 01:04:43,667
Master Lee,

1395
01:04:43,709 --> 01:04:45,042
Your girls are all very pretty-

1396
01:04:45,084 --> 01:04:45,417
Yes.

1397
01:04:45,459 --> 01:04:48,501
But no one is quite like my Starling.

1398
01:04:49,584 --> 01:04:50,542
Starling?

1399
01:04:50,584 --> 01:04:52,584
Boss, that's the woman.

1400
01:04:53,334 --> 01:04:54,209
What's the matter?

1401
01:04:55,251 --> 01:04:55,709
I saw her

1402
01:04:55,751 --> 01:04:58,292
with a guy called Wax.

1403
01:04:58,334 --> 01:04:59,417
Impossible.

1404
01:04:59,459 --> 01:05:01,667
Starling is with William.

1405
01:05:01,709 --> 01:05:03,876
That must have been someone else.

1406
01:05:03,917 --> 01:05:05,667
You mean we're all blind?

1407
01:05:06,417 --> 01:05:07,959
Everybody, chill.

1408
01:05:08,001 --> 01:05:09,751
We're all friends here.

1409
01:05:09,792 --> 01:05:12,876
William, aren't you friends with the mayor?

1410
01:05:13,667 --> 01:05:14,917
Here's the thing.

1411
01:05:14,959 --> 01:05:17,542
Big Red, why don't you tell him yourself.

1412
01:05:19,167 --> 01:05:22,667
William, it's really simple.

1413
01:05:24,417 --> 01:05:28,126
I want to run the City Housing Authority

1414
01:05:28,167 --> 01:05:30,959
and you're the only one who can help me.

1415
01:05:37,001 --> 01:05:39,376
You want me to

1416
01:05:39,417 --> 01:05:41,292
mention it to the mayor?

1417
01:05:41,334 --> 01:05:43,959
Right?

1418
01:05:44,001 --> 01:05:46,584
I want you to convince the mayor

1419
01:05:46,626 --> 01:05:49,584
not just mention it.

1420
01:05:53,084 --> 01:05:54,417
Fine.

1421
01:05:55,459 --> 01:05:57,542
But I'll need something from you too.

1422
01:06:13,209 --> 01:06:15,667
Hey, cut, cut, cut.

1423
01:06:15,709 --> 01:06:17,417
Wax, what's wrong with you?

1424
01:06:17,459 --> 01:06:19,417
This isn't a comedy.

1425
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:21,376
I'm sorry.

1426
01:06:24,001 --> 01:06:24,459
What's the matter with you?

1427
01:06:24,501 --> 01:06:26,167
What are you laughing at?

1428
01:06:26,209 --> 01:06:27,001
You know every time

1429
01:06:27,001 --> 01:06:28,792
you screw up a take, he has to kiss her again.

1430
01:06:28,834 --> 01:06:30,292
It wasn't on purpose,
I was changing my pants.

1431
01:06:30,334 --> 01:06:31,334
I didn't know he'd say "action" so quickly.

1432
01:06:31,376 --> 01:06:33,292
Changing your pants? Back there?

1433
01:06:42,876 --> 01:06:44,626
Why do they have to kiss for so long?

1434
01:06:50,209 --> 01:06:50,751
Cut.

1435
01:06:51,542 --> 01:06:52,917
Who said that?

1436
01:06:53,917 --> 01:06:56,542
Hey you,
why are you yelling cut during their scene?

1437
01:06:56,584 --> 01:06:57,334
Get out, get out, get out!

1438
01:06:57,376 --> 01:06:59,126
Had enough fun yet?

1439
01:06:59,167 --> 01:06:59,959
All of you, get out!

1440
01:07:00,001 --> 01:07:00,709
Sorry, sorry

1441
01:07:00,751 --> 01:07:02,001
It's my friends' first time on set.

1442
01:07:02,667 --> 01:07:04,042
Come on, let's go.

1443
01:07:04,084 --> 01:07:05,876
Let's take a break.

1444
01:07:08,292 --> 01:07:10,876
Enjoying yourself? You're up next.

1445
01:07:11,334 --> 01:07:11,792
Me?

1446
01:07:11,834 --> 01:07:13,417
Yeah

1447
01:07:13,459 --> 01:07:15,084
Hey, thanks.

1448
01:07:15,126 --> 01:07:17,042
No problem, now hurry up.

1449
01:07:19,792 --> 01:07:21,251
Have a seat.

1450
01:07:21,917 --> 01:07:23,042
You want a different pose?

1451
01:07:24,709 --> 01:07:25,626
Tie him up.

1452
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:28,167
I thought this was a kissing scene.

1453
01:07:28,209 --> 01:07:31,126
A kissing scene? You can kiss my ass.

1454
01:07:31,167 --> 01:07:33,584
Haven't you ever seen a super hero movie?

1455
01:07:33,626 --> 01:07:35,917
The hero always takes a beating

1456
01:07:35,959 --> 01:07:38,334
before he gets to kiss the girl.

1457
01:07:38,376 --> 01:07:41,042
And the kissing scene isn't for you.

1458
01:07:42,751 --> 01:07:44,292
Director, I have a little suggestion.

1459
01:07:44,334 --> 01:07:45,292
Yes?

1460
01:07:45,667 --> 01:07:47,501
They should hit him for real.

1461
01:07:47,542 --> 01:07:48,209
For real?

1462
01:07:48,251 --> 01:07:49,709
That would be more realistic.

1463
01:07:49,751 --> 01:07:51,709
Besides, he's a stuntman, right?

1464
01:07:51,751 --> 01:07:54,334
Hey, can you take a real beating?

1465
01:07:57,709 --> 01:07:58,751
Yeah.

1466
01:07:58,876 --> 01:08:00,126
Perfect.

1467
01:08:01,042 --> 01:08:02,334
Hey, Director!

1468
01:08:02,376 --> 01:08:03,417
Sorry. sorry!

1469
01:08:03,459 --> 01:08:04,334
Sorry, William.

1470
01:08:04,376 --> 01:08:05,167
Your seat's over there.

1471
01:08:05,209 --> 01:08:06,376
I'm so sorry.

1472
01:08:17,126 --> 01:08:18,709
Take your time with that.

1473
01:08:18,709 --> 01:08:19,209
I'm gonna go change.

1474
01:08:19,209 --> 01:08:22,001
Oh, okay. See you, William.

1475
01:08:29,709 --> 01:08:32,667
Director, everyone looks tired today.

1476
01:08:33,459 --> 01:08:35,667
Shall we take a break?

1477
01:08:38,251 --> 01:08:39,376
Cut, cut, cut

1478
01:08:39,417 --> 01:08:40,584
That's a wrap.

1479
01:08:40,626 --> 01:08:41,667
Perfect.

1480
01:08:47,542 --> 01:08:49,251
Are you okay?

1481
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:50,876
I'm fine.

1482
01:08:51,501 --> 01:08:52,792
Pretty badass, right?

1483
01:08:52,834 --> 01:08:55,167
Yes, that was quite a beating you took.

1484
01:08:55,209 --> 01:08:56,167
No, what I meant was

1485
01:08:56,209 --> 01:09:00,042
after all that, my hair still looks good.

1486
01:09:02,126 --> 01:09:03,251
Are you in pain?

1487
01:09:03,292 --> 01:09:04,751
Nah, I'm fine.

1488
01:09:06,167 --> 01:09:10,251
I felt terrible watching you get beaten up.

1489
01:09:13,376 --> 01:09:14,917
Then it's all worth it.

1490
01:09:14,959 --> 01:09:16,584
What?

1491
01:09:16,626 --> 01:09:17,667
I'm gonna go change.

1492
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:32,667
What are you staring at? Hop in.

1493
01:09:32,709 --> 01:09:33,584
Is this your car?

1494
01:09:33,626 --> 01:09:34,876
Yes.

1495
01:09:34,917 --> 01:09:35,959
Who are you fooling?

1496
01:09:36,001 --> 01:09:38,084
Why else do you think I work so hard?

1497
01:09:38,126 --> 01:09:39,667
Hard-earned money.

1498
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:50,084
Stop here for a second.

1499
01:09:52,084 --> 01:09:53,042
Can I give you a lift?

1500
01:09:53,084 --> 01:09:54,626
That's okay.

1501
01:09:54,626 --> 01:09:56,251
I'm going the other way.

1502
01:09:56,251 --> 01:09:57,459
My driver can swing around and drop you off.

1503
01:09:58,501 --> 01:10:01,084
No, really, it's fine.

1504
01:10:01,126 --> 01:10:03,459
My father will pick me up soon.

1505
01:10:03,501 --> 01:10:05,126
See you tomorrow.

1506
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:07,917
OK, see you tomorrow.

1507
01:10:12,126 --> 01:10:12,709
Let's go.

1508
01:10:23,501 --> 01:10:25,584
Looks like nobody's here.

1509
01:10:26,459 --> 01:10:27,917
Hello?

1510
01:10:27,917 --> 01:10:29,126
What are you doing here?

1511
01:10:29,126 --> 01:10:31,042
Dr. Bo and Tofu went out, so we're in charge.

1512
01:10:31,042 --> 01:10:32,584
Starling, have a seat.

1513
01:10:32,584 --> 01:10:34,667
I'm fine, patch yourself up first.

1514
01:10:36,334 --> 01:10:38,709
Do you want to try our house special?

1515
01:10:39,709 --> 01:10:40,501
Starling,

1516
01:10:41,292 --> 01:10:43,251
Would you like to try our house special?

1517
01:10:43,751 --> 01:10:45,251
Why are you mimicking me?

1518
01:10:45,709 --> 01:10:48,001
Wax, what happened to your face?

1519
01:10:48,251 --> 01:10:49,084
Did you get in a fight?

1520
01:10:49,792 --> 01:10:50,834
It was William, wasn't it?

1521
01:10:51,042 --> 01:10:52,001
No-

1522
01:10:52,001 --> 01:10:54,042
Right. He couldn't have beaten you up.

1523
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,001
Starling, want a drink?

1524
01:10:56,334 --> 01:10:57,876
I can mix you anything you want.

1525
01:10:58,459 --> 01:11:00,501
Then I'd like a glass of truth serum.

1526
01:11:00,501 --> 01:11:01,542
For him.

1527
01:11:01,542 --> 01:11:03,292
Because he's so stubborn.

1528
01:11:04,251 --> 01:11:06,042
Even if he's hurt he won't admit it.

1529
01:11:06,042 --> 01:11:08,417
I knew you got in a fight.

1530
01:11:11,167 --> 01:11:12,126
Done.

1531
01:11:12,542 --> 01:11:14,459
It's not the same glass, what are you doing?

1532
01:11:14,876 --> 01:11:15,834
Drink it.

1533
01:11:16,334 --> 01:11:18,292
Starling asked you to drink it, so drink up.

1534
01:11:18,459 --> 01:11:20,292
And then tell us who you got in a fight with.

1535
01:11:20,292 --> 01:11:21,792
Yeah.

1536
01:11:21,792 --> 01:11:22,834
Do you like Starling?

1537
01:11:22,834 --> 01:11:23,709
Yes.

1538
01:11:27,459 --> 01:11:30,376
I'm going upstairs for a sec.

1539
01:11:30,376 --> 01:11:31,667
What did you give him?

1540
01:11:33,584 --> 01:11:34,834
Tap water.

1541
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:37,626
Sister-in-law-

1542
01:11:37,959 --> 01:11:39,334
Sister-in-law-

1543
01:13:23,292 --> 01:13:24,542
No peeking.

1544
01:13:24,542 --> 01:13:26,251
I'm not peeking.

1545
01:13:26,542 --> 01:13:28,334
Why all the mystery?

1546
01:13:28,334 --> 01:13:29,376
You'll find out soon enough.

1547
01:13:29,667 --> 01:13:31,001
No peeking.

1548
01:13:31,001 --> 01:13:33,751
I'm not. What is it you want to show me?

1549
01:13:35,542 --> 01:13:36,876
What is it?

1550
01:13:36,876 --> 01:13:38,084
Ready?

1551
01:13:38,584 --> 01:13:39,126
Ready?

1552
01:13:39,376 --> 01:13:39,917
Yes.

1553
01:14:22,584 --> 01:14:26,584
<i>The moonlight splashes upon the rooftop.</i>

1554
01:14:26,584 --> 01:14:30,417
<i>Your silhouette leaves me dazzled.</i>

1555
01:14:30,417 --> 01:14:37,792
<i>I know I'm not good enough for you</i>

1556
01:14:38,334 --> 01:14:41,917
<i>But I'll hold on to hope.</i>

1557
01:14:41,917 --> 01:14:46,251
<i>Protecting you</i>

1558
01:14:46,251 --> 01:14:52,209
<i>Just like protecting
this beautiful rooftop scenery.</i>

1559
01:14:54,042 --> 01:14:58,084
<i>The blowing wind can't cut off</i>

1560
01:14:58,084 --> 01:15:01,876
<i>the development of our story.</i>

1561
01:15:01,876 --> 01:15:09,084
<i>This romance belongs only to us.</i>

1562
01:15:09,084 --> 01:15:13,376
<i>It's quietly blooming.</i>

1563
01:15:13,376 --> 01:15:14,626
<i>The moonlight on this rooftop.</i>

1564
01:15:14,626 --> 01:15:17,584
<i>(Starling)
The moonlight on this rooftop.</i>

1565
01:15:17,584 --> 01:15:18,209
<i>(Starling) Bestows me the strength
to fall in love with you.</i>

1566
01:15:18,209 --> 01:15:20,334
<i>Bestows me the strength
to fall in love with you.</i>

1567
01:15:20,334 --> 01:15:22,209
<i>Star(Starling) Bestows me the
strength to fall in love with you.</i>

1568
01:15:22,209 --> 01:15:24,001
Love(Starling) 
 <i> Bestows me the strength 
to fall in love with you.</i>

1569
01:15:24,001 --> 01:15:25,959
<i>Bestows me the strength
to fall in love with you.</i>

1570
01:15:37,709 --> 01:15:39,459
Happy Valentine's Day!

1571
01:16:05,126 --> 01:16:06,417
Hello!

1572
01:16:06,417 --> 01:16:07,667
Not so fast!

1573
01:16:11,584 --> 01:16:12,584
Come here.

1574
01:16:57,626 --> 01:16:59,084
Happy Valentine's Day!

1575
01:17:06,459 --> 01:17:08,917
The little princess is heading home.

1576
01:17:08,917 --> 01:17:11,001
I had a great time today.

1577
01:17:18,209 --> 01:17:19,876
Do you have to take me home so early?

1578
01:17:19,876 --> 01:17:20,917
It's because of my dad, isn't it?

1579
01:17:34,501 --> 01:17:38,584
William, don't forget your promise to Big Red.

1580
01:17:41,542 --> 01:17:43,626
Give these photos to Bao.

1581
01:17:43,626 --> 01:17:45,459
Have him send them to the newspapers, ok?

1582
01:17:46,501 --> 01:17:48,626
William, you sure that's a good idea?

1583
01:17:48,626 --> 01:17:50,084
It'll hurt the movie.

1584
01:17:50,292 --> 01:17:53,501
Cut the crap, just do what I say.

1585
01:17:53,667 --> 01:17:54,459
Go.

1586
01:17:56,709 --> 01:17:59,126
Go tell Big Red

1587
01:17:59,126 --> 01:18:00,584
that William has kept his word.

1588
01:18:15,917 --> 01:18:19,126
<i>Run run run, I like to watch you run.</i>

1589
01:18:19,126 --> 01:18:22,251
<i>Flee flee flee, don't let me catch you.</i>

1590
01:18:22,251 --> 01:18:27,209
<i>Fugitive, how romantic.</i>

1591
01:18:27,209 --> 01:18:30,376
<i>There's a strip of electric poles ahead.</i>

1592
01:18:30,376 --> 01:18:31,792
<i>Makes me wanna whistle.</i>

1593
01:18:31,792 --> 01:18:33,542
<i>Don't run,</i>

1594
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:34,876
<i>I love to watch you go.</i>

1595
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:39,501
<i>Run fast, run quickly,</i>

1596
01:18:39,834 --> 01:18:41,209
<i>Superstar, you and me.</i>

1597
01:18:41,209 --> 01:18:43,084
<i>Run, run, run</i>

1598
01:18:43,084 --> 01:18:44,376
<i>don't howl at me.</i>

1599
01:18:44,376 --> 01:18:46,126
<i>Woof, woof, woof</i>

1600
01:18:46,126 --> 01:18:47,584
<i>bark like a dog.</i>

1601
01:18:47,584 --> 01:18:49,126
<i>Snap, snap...</i>

1602
01:18:49,126 --> 01:18:52,167
<i>I don't care if you live or die.</i>

1603
01:18:53,876 --> 01:18:55,584
<i>Smile,</i>

1604
01:18:55,584 --> 01:18:57,084
<i>take a picture.</i>

1605
01:18:57,084 --> 01:18:58,834
<i>Shake,</i>

1606
01:18:58,834 --> 01:19:00,167
<i>tomorrow, you're on the front page.</i>

1607
01:19:00,167 --> 01:19:01,751
Snap, Snap

1608
01:19:01,751 --> 01:19:05,084
<i>You don't have any freedom.</i>

1609
01:19:05,084 --> 01:19:08,709
<i>Your life is in my hands.</i>

1610
01:19:08,709 --> 01:19:11,792
Extra! Extra! Read all about it!

1611
01:19:12,959 --> 01:19:16,584
Extra! Extra! Read all about it!

1612
01:19:30,167 --> 01:19:36,167
Extra! Extra! Read all about it!

1613
01:19:38,126 --> 01:19:40,167
Extra! Extra! Read all about it!

1614
01:19:45,126 --> 01:19:46,542
Starling-

1615
01:19:46,542 --> 01:19:49,001
How could you let this happen?

1616
01:19:49,001 --> 01:19:51,376
Are you trying to ruin your career?

1617
01:19:53,209 --> 01:19:56,501
I don't know how they got these photos.

1618
01:19:56,501 --> 01:19:57,417
You don't know?

1619
01:19:57,417 --> 01:19:59,792
Must be that boy, he pulled a fast one on you.

1620
01:19:59,792 --> 01:20:01,626
Wax would never do that to me.

1621
01:20:02,417 --> 01:20:04,751
You still trust him?

1622
01:20:04,751 --> 01:20:06,917
There are reporters waiting outside.

1623
01:20:06,917 --> 01:20:08,876
I don't even know what to do.

1624
01:20:18,626 --> 01:20:19,626
What's all the excitement?

1625
01:20:20,001 --> 01:20:21,376
Hi, Wax.

1626
01:20:21,376 --> 01:20:22,709
Come over here, let's get your picture.

1627
01:20:22,709 --> 01:20:23,251
Get a shot of him.

1628
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:24,376
How did you know my name?

1629
01:20:25,209 --> 01:20:26,542
Where'd you get the name "Wax"?

1630
01:20:26,542 --> 01:20:28,167
Can we get an action shot? Yes, like that.

1631
01:20:29,417 --> 01:20:32,667
It's like hair wax.

1632
01:20:32,667 --> 01:20:33,417
Everyday, I-

1633
01:20:33,417 --> 01:20:34,459
Okay, that's not important.

1634
01:20:34,459 --> 01:20:36,584
Let's get a shot of you holding our paper.

1635
01:20:36,584 --> 01:20:37,876
Let's get one with our paper too.

1636
01:20:41,251 --> 01:20:42,959
See that smug look on his face?

1637
01:20:47,584 --> 01:20:48,584
Where'd you get this photo?

1638
01:20:48,584 --> 01:20:49,751
I thought you sent it out.

1639
01:20:49,751 --> 01:20:50,959
What do you mean?

1640
01:20:51,167 --> 01:20:52,251
Let's go.

1641
01:20:53,376 --> 01:20:54,709
Thanks,guys.

1642
01:20:55,001 --> 01:20:56,751
I want to state once and for all

1643
01:20:56,751 --> 01:20:58,459
That brat has nothing to do with my Starling.

1644
01:20:58,459 --> 01:21:00,584
There's no relationship whatsoever.

1645
01:21:00,876 --> 01:21:01,709
So you don't consider him

1646
01:21:01,709 --> 01:21:02,667
to be Starling's boyfriend then?

1647
01:21:02,667 --> 01:21:04,376
What boyfriend?

1648
01:21:04,834 --> 01:21:06,876
Just because they spent
Valentine's Day together-

1649
01:21:06,876 --> 01:21:07,959
Mr. Lee, let me explain.

1650
01:21:07,959 --> 01:21:08,876
I didn't take this picture.

1651
01:21:08,876 --> 01:21:10,167
You think we're all fools?

1652
01:21:10,167 --> 01:21:11,626
Of course you didn't take it.

1653
01:21:11,626 --> 01:21:12,792
You had someone else take it.

1654
01:21:12,792 --> 01:21:13,751
How much money did you make off this?

1655
01:21:13,751 --> 01:21:14,834
Yeah, how much?

1656
01:21:15,542 --> 01:21:17,667
You Rooftop people only care about money.

1657
01:21:18,334 --> 01:21:21,001
I'm warning you, stay away from Starling.

1658
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:21,584
Get lost.

1659
01:21:24,167 --> 01:21:25,751
Okay, we're done here.

1660
01:21:25,751 --> 01:21:27,584
Thank you, everybody.

1661
01:21:38,126 --> 01:21:40,459
Lee, you go on inside.

1662
01:21:40,459 --> 01:21:42,209
I want to talk to Starling.

1663
01:21:42,209 --> 01:21:44,667
Yes, William.

1664
01:21:45,876 --> 01:21:47,042
Don't worry.

1665
01:21:47,042 --> 01:21:50,209
I won't let him near Starling ever again.

1666
01:21:50,209 --> 01:21:51,709
I understand.

1667
01:21:51,709 --> 01:21:54,917
There are a lot of people like him out there.

1668
01:21:54,917 --> 01:21:57,501
And Starling is naive.

1669
01:21:57,501 --> 01:21:59,917
She doesn't understand
the ways of the world.

1670
01:22:00,459 --> 01:22:01,709
You understand?

1671
01:22:01,709 --> 01:22:03,584
That brat was just using you

1672
01:22:03,584 --> 01:22:05,459
to sell photos.

1673
01:22:06,751 --> 01:22:08,209
Okay, I'm going inside.

1674
01:22:08,209 --> 01:22:09,667
Okay. Take your time.

1675
01:22:12,709 --> 01:22:15,792
A-Pu, drive on up ahead.

1676
01:22:20,126 --> 01:22:21,584
The studio is not happy.

1677
01:22:22,542 --> 01:22:25,959
They think that the news will hurt the film.

1678
01:22:26,834 --> 01:22:28,209
I'm sorry.

1679
01:22:29,709 --> 01:22:31,334
But we can fix that

1680
01:22:32,292 --> 01:22:34,334
if we create a bigger news story

1681
01:22:34,334 --> 01:22:37,126
than the one between you and that guy.

1682
01:22:40,626 --> 01:22:43,834
Starling, think about it.

1683
01:22:43,834 --> 01:22:46,001
Your father is stressed about his debts.

1684
01:22:46,001 --> 01:22:49,084
He begged me to sign you
and put you in a movie.

1685
01:22:49,084 --> 01:22:51,292
You have a career, thanks to your father.

1686
01:22:51,292 --> 01:22:53,334
He even put you up in a huge house.

1687
01:22:54,917 --> 01:22:57,084
If you let that guy affect you

1688
01:22:57,084 --> 01:22:58,792
then what's going to happen to your father?

1689
01:22:59,084 --> 01:22:59,709
Huh?

1690
01:23:05,626 --> 01:23:07,501
I hired a photographer. He's back there.

1691
01:23:08,417 --> 01:23:09,292
Don't look.

1692
01:23:10,834 --> 01:23:12,917
Just let him take some photos.

1693
01:23:13,334 --> 01:23:16,001
Your father can keep on living the good life.

1694
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:18,959
You're a good daughter.

1695
01:23:19,417 --> 01:23:22,251
I don't believe you'd say no, right?

1696
01:23:36,626 --> 01:23:38,251
<i>This just in... The hottest movie star, William</i>

1697
01:23:38,251 --> 01:23:42,167
<i>has admitted to his relationship
with Starling.</i>

1698
01:23:42,167 --> 01:23:43,834
<i>Their agency has confirmed the news.</i>

1699
01:23:45,209 --> 01:23:45,917
Why are you so early today?

1700
01:23:45,917 --> 01:23:47,709
Just came to fix this radio.

1701
01:23:47,709 --> 01:23:49,251
<i>The two say they're getting serious.</i>

1702
01:23:49,251 --> 01:23:50,542
What are you doing?

1703
01:23:50,542 --> 01:23:52,584
Conserving energy.

1704
01:23:52,876 --> 01:23:53,459
What are you doing?

1705
01:23:53,626 --> 01:23:56,042
Watching a cartoon,
wanna join me, it's really good.

1706
01:23:56,292 --> 01:23:57,042
I gotta go to work.

1707
01:23:57,251 --> 01:23:59,417
Wax, I'm sure you'll get over it eventually.

1708
01:23:59,792 --> 01:24:01,667
Hey. Silence is golden.

1709
01:24:01,667 --> 01:24:03,084
What are you doing?

1710
01:24:08,876 --> 01:24:11,667
I'll take all of your papers, please.

1711
01:24:14,959 --> 01:24:15,751
Hey Wax.

1712
01:24:15,751 --> 01:24:16,542
One newspaper, please.

1713
01:24:16,542 --> 01:24:17,292
But he just-

1714
01:24:17,292 --> 01:24:19,001
He what? He doesn't sell newspapers.

1715
01:24:19,001 --> 01:24:21,001
What do you want to eat? My treat.

1716
01:24:21,167 --> 01:24:21,959
I'm not hungry.

1717
01:24:21,959 --> 01:24:23,709
Not hungry? How 'bout some almond tea?

1718
01:24:23,709 --> 01:24:24,251
Not thirsty.

1719
01:24:24,251 --> 01:24:26,209
Wax, if I were her, I'd choose you.

1720
01:24:26,209 --> 01:24:27,042
I'd choose you too.

1721
01:24:27,042 --> 01:24:27,584
What do you mean?

1722
01:24:27,709 --> 01:24:29,417
Choose what? What are you talking about?

1723
01:24:29,417 --> 01:24:30,792
Choose

1724
01:24:30,792 --> 01:24:32,501
Mr. Universe!

1725
01:24:33,001 --> 01:24:34,501
You guys are on time today.

1726
01:24:36,334 --> 01:24:37,459
We should be safe here.

1727
01:24:37,459 --> 01:24:38,209
Relax.

1728
01:24:38,209 --> 01:24:39,792
Dr. Bo's a cheapskate,
he doesn't have anything.

1729
01:24:39,792 --> 01:24:41,542
No newspaper subscription.

1730
01:24:41,542 --> 01:24:43,917
Radio's broken, no TV

1731
01:24:45,417 --> 01:24:47,376
Why are you guys so early today?

1732
01:24:47,834 --> 01:24:48,501
Hey!

1733
01:24:48,876 --> 01:24:49,751
Hey, Dr. Bo

1734
01:24:49,917 --> 01:24:51,209
You trying to scare us?

1735
01:24:51,209 --> 01:24:52,917
Why are you so early today?

1736
01:24:52,917 --> 01:24:54,042
Come here, I've got something to show you.

1737
01:24:54,042 --> 01:24:54,917
Come over here.

1738
01:24:56,792 --> 01:24:57,834
What is it?

1739
01:25:05,459 --> 01:25:08,292
Check it out, a brand-new TV.

1740
01:25:08,459 --> 01:25:09,167
I bet you lads

1741
01:25:09,167 --> 01:25:10,251
never had a TV at home.

1742
01:25:10,251 --> 01:25:11,126
Am I right?

1743
01:25:14,167 --> 01:25:15,709
<i>Up next, breaking news...</i>

1744
01:25:15,917 --> 01:25:19,626
<i>The hottest movie stars,
William and Starling</i>

1745
01:25:19,626 --> 01:25:21,334
<i>have been photographed kissing
in the street.</i>

1746
01:25:21,334 --> 01:25:23,376
<i>William said
that even though Starling is new,</i>

1747
01:25:23,376 --> 01:25:25,084
<i>he hopes his fans will love her too</i>

1748
01:25:25,084 --> 01:25:27,292
<i>and support their relationship.</i>

1749
01:25:36,251 --> 01:25:38,667
You brat, it's you again.

1750
01:25:38,667 --> 01:25:40,126
You got the paparazzi with you again?

1751
01:25:40,126 --> 01:25:41,542
Take my picture if you like.

1752
01:25:43,334 --> 01:25:45,917
Sir, is Starling home?

1753
01:25:45,917 --> 01:25:47,417
She doesn't want to see you.

1754
01:25:47,417 --> 01:25:49,501
She's with William.

1755
01:25:50,792 --> 01:25:52,417
He's a superstar. And you?

1756
01:25:52,417 --> 01:25:54,167
You're a nobody.

1757
01:25:54,167 --> 01:25:56,042
You think my Starling is blind?

1758
01:25:56,042 --> 01:25:59,167
She knows who can give her a good life.

1759
01:25:59,584 --> 01:26:03,584
Do me a favor, don't show up here again.

1760
01:26:03,584 --> 01:26:06,542
If you really love her, let her go.

1761
01:26:09,626 --> 01:26:11,084
Now go.

1762
01:26:56,292 --> 01:26:59,167
<i>Forget about her</i>

1763
01:26:59,167 --> 01:27:02,751
<i>I keep telling myself.</i>

1764
01:27:02,751 --> 01:27:06,292
<i>Though I don't know her any more.</i>

1765
01:27:06,292 --> 01:27:11,292
<i>In my heart, she's still so clear.</i>

1766
01:27:11,292 --> 01:27:13,667
<i>Oh, forget about it.</i>

1767
01:27:13,667 --> 01:27:16,626
<i>Just go along with the melody</i>

1768
01:27:17,209 --> 01:27:20,167
<i>and forget the sorrow.</i>

1769
01:27:20,792 --> 01:27:25,542
<i>I can keep going, without backup.</i>

1770
01:27:26,209 --> 01:27:33,542
<i>Move forward, find new memories,
new surroundings.</i>

1771
01:27:33,542 --> 01:27:40,126
<i>clear up, wait for the rain to give up.</i>

1772
01:27:40,126 --> 01:27:44,667
<i>Crying in the rain.</i>

1773
01:27:44,667 --> 01:27:47,751
<i>But you're everywhere.</i>

1774
01:27:48,209 --> 01:27:54,376
<i>Maybe I won't see you any more
if I wipe them away.</i>

1775
01:27:54,792 --> 01:28:00,042
<i>Your smile is so clear in my mind.</i>

1776
01:28:00,042 --> 01:28:05,959
<i>I'm totally wrapped up in you.</i>

1777
01:28:06,501 --> 01:28:09,126
<i>I weep with the rain.</i>

1778
01:28:09,126 --> 01:28:13,792
<i>Crying in the rain.</i>

1779
01:28:13,792 --> 01:28:17,167
<i>You're everywhere.</i>

1780
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:23,751
<i>Holding you tight
is the only way out of this pain.</i>

1781
01:28:23,751 --> 01:28:29,209
<i>There is no room for me in your world.</i>

1782
01:28:29,209 --> 01:28:35,584
<i>I'm not sure who's harder to see, you or me.</i>

1783
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:42,709
<i>We're both waiting for the rain to stop.</i>

1784
01:29:30,876 --> 01:29:33,376
Hey, when her movie comes out

1785
01:29:33,376 --> 01:29:34,417
are you gonna go see it?

1786
01:29:34,417 --> 01:29:36,292
I don't think so.

1787
01:29:36,292 --> 01:29:39,376
Besides, who has money for tickets?

1788
01:29:39,792 --> 01:29:41,501
I want to see her and William's acting.

1789
01:29:43,126 --> 01:29:44,001
Yeah, seriously.

1790
01:29:44,001 --> 01:29:45,542
She's been in so many commercials lately.

1791
01:29:45,792 --> 01:29:47,626
It's getting to be a bit much.

1792
01:29:48,001 --> 01:29:48,751
You know

1793
01:29:48,751 --> 01:29:51,667
it'd be impossible to take down that billboard.

1794
01:29:51,667 --> 01:29:53,501
So if A-Lang and I get the chance

1795
01:29:53,501 --> 01:29:56,959
maybe we could spruce it up a bit.

1796
01:29:56,959 --> 01:30:00,417
Yeah, we'd risk our lives for you.

1797
01:30:01,001 --> 01:30:04,751
But it's so damn high.

1798
01:30:08,292 --> 01:30:11,292
Go! Chop-chop.

1799
01:30:12,084 --> 01:30:13,667
You stole my tune.

1800
01:30:13,667 --> 01:30:15,042
It was my tune.

1801
01:30:16,792 --> 01:30:17,917
Bye-bye.

1802
01:30:17,917 --> 01:30:19,209
Cut the bye's.

1803
01:30:22,209 --> 01:30:22,834
Wax-

1804
01:30:24,167 --> 01:30:25,167
Women...

1805
01:30:25,167 --> 01:30:26,959
are just like buttons.

1806
01:30:26,959 --> 01:30:28,709
You drop one on the street.

1807
01:30:28,709 --> 01:30:29,751
And if you aren't paying attention

1808
01:30:29,751 --> 01:30:31,667
you won't go back and look for it.

1809
01:30:31,667 --> 01:30:32,751
Your problem is

1810
01:30:32,751 --> 01:30:34,751
you're paying too much attention.

1811
01:30:34,959 --> 01:30:36,626
Without buttons,

1812
01:30:36,626 --> 01:30:38,001
a shirt can still look good.

1813
01:30:38,959 --> 01:30:40,917
I've got a lot of buttons.

1814
01:30:40,917 --> 01:30:42,376
I can get you one for right here.

1815
01:30:43,001 --> 01:30:44,042
Here, here, here-

1816
01:30:44,042 --> 01:30:45,626
This shirt doesn't have any buttons.

1817
01:30:45,792 --> 01:30:47,584
I know that.

1818
01:30:50,251 --> 01:30:52,251
You know what?

1819
01:30:52,376 --> 01:30:53,459
I don't really want to be part of

1820
01:30:53,459 --> 01:30:56,292
all the politics at the City Housing Authority.

1821
01:30:56,292 --> 01:30:58,417
I feel bad

1822
01:30:58,417 --> 01:31:00,376
about getting you guys involved.

1823
01:31:00,376 --> 01:31:01,917
Feel bad for what? It's not a big deal.

1824
01:31:02,084 --> 01:31:02,709
Hey-

1825
01:31:02,709 --> 01:31:04,417
You left your work at the clinic to help me.

1826
01:31:04,417 --> 01:31:05,584
And got chased by Big Red.

1827
01:31:05,584 --> 01:31:06,084
Hey

1828
01:31:06,084 --> 01:31:07,792
What if Big Red comes here?

1829
01:31:09,584 --> 01:31:12,667
I just want to keep life simple.

1830
01:31:14,542 --> 01:31:16,376
Look at the people living on the Rooftop.

1831
01:31:16,376 --> 01:31:18,042
Some of them have never been down there.

1832
01:31:18,042 --> 01:31:19,917
They know nothing about the outside world.

1833
01:31:19,917 --> 01:31:21,751
They don't make any money,

1834
01:31:21,751 --> 01:31:23,709
but they're happy.

1835
01:31:25,501 --> 01:31:26,751
So,

1836
01:31:26,751 --> 01:31:28,542
Without the City Housing Authority

1837
01:31:28,542 --> 01:31:30,167
we'd all be a lot happier.

1838
01:31:31,959 --> 01:31:34,334
What put you in such a funk?

1839
01:31:36,709 --> 01:31:38,667
Are we bros or what?

1840
01:31:38,667 --> 01:31:39,834
Yes.

1841
01:31:40,667 --> 01:31:44,084
Then go with me to Rango's tomorrow.
I'll quit.

1842
01:31:46,542 --> 01:31:48,501
Rango-

1843
01:31:49,417 --> 01:31:52,876
What's the rush to see me?

1844
01:31:54,001 --> 01:31:57,459
You should know.

1845
01:31:57,459 --> 01:31:59,501
The mayor told me.

1846
01:32:01,001 --> 01:32:02,334
What a surprise to find out

1847
01:32:07,334 --> 01:32:10,334
this one's dared to ask for my position.

1848
01:32:13,876 --> 01:32:15,709
You've come at just the right time.
Come on in.

1849
01:32:17,042 --> 01:32:18,917
Why do we always come at the wrong time?

1850
01:32:20,042 --> 01:32:21,042
Hi Rango.

1851
01:32:21,209 --> 01:32:22,376
You two, take a seat over there.

1852
01:32:22,376 --> 01:32:23,209
Okay.

1853
01:32:24,417 --> 01:32:27,459
Tempura, starting tomorrow

1854
01:32:27,751 --> 01:32:28,626
you and your friend

1855
01:32:28,626 --> 01:32:32,167
are in charge of the entire East District.

1856
01:32:33,959 --> 01:32:34,834
Rango-

1857
01:32:36,292 --> 01:32:38,376
That's my district.

1858
01:32:38,376 --> 01:32:39,709
Yes.

1859
01:32:40,542 --> 01:32:43,876
It was until yesterday.

1860
01:32:43,876 --> 01:32:48,084
I told them to start tomorrow.

1861
01:32:48,084 --> 01:32:49,042
Is there a problem?

1862
01:32:50,292 --> 01:32:51,709
What do you mean?

1863
01:32:51,709 --> 01:32:52,792
Big Red-

1864
01:32:59,084 --> 01:33:01,001
What I mean is,

1865
01:33:04,709 --> 01:33:07,501
I want you out of
the City Housing Authority for good.

1866
01:33:12,417 --> 01:33:13,792
Just you wait.

1867
01:33:23,417 --> 01:33:24,584
Let's go.

1868
01:33:28,542 --> 01:33:30,417
Hey, what are they doing here on set?

1869
01:33:42,501 --> 01:33:45,709
William, long time no see.

1870
01:33:47,167 --> 01:33:48,376
What's the matter now?

1871
01:33:48,376 --> 01:33:51,501
You promised me a deal with the mayor.

1872
01:33:51,501 --> 01:33:52,834
But the mayor betrayed me.

1873
01:33:52,834 --> 01:33:54,792
Why the hell is that?

1874
01:33:55,459 --> 01:33:57,542
Big Red, I did what I could.

1875
01:33:57,542 --> 01:34:00,959
What he decides is none of my business.

1876
01:34:00,959 --> 01:34:03,126
Are you fucking playing me?

1877
01:34:03,126 --> 01:34:04,292
Let me say this

1878
01:34:04,292 --> 01:34:05,376
very clearly.

1879
01:34:05,709 --> 01:34:07,001
I only play people who are worth it.

1880
01:34:07,001 --> 01:34:09,376
You have anything that's worth it?

1881
01:34:09,667 --> 01:34:10,709
Huh?

1882
01:34:11,876 --> 01:34:14,376
Here, this is for the photos you took.

1883
01:34:14,376 --> 01:34:16,251
I suggest you hurry up and take it.

1884
01:34:16,251 --> 01:34:18,376
We have a movie premiere to go to.

1885
01:34:18,376 --> 01:34:20,417
You're wasting our time.

1886
01:34:23,876 --> 01:34:26,251
Thanks, enjoy your premiere.

1887
01:34:26,917 --> 01:34:29,917
Outta the way!

1888
01:34:34,376 --> 01:34:37,542
May 31 st, isn't that today?

1889
01:34:37,542 --> 01:34:39,084
Yeah, it's today.

1890
01:34:39,876 --> 01:34:42,084
Is dinner ready, Jasmine?

1891
01:34:42,084 --> 01:34:43,251
Yes, it's ready.

1892
01:34:43,251 --> 01:34:44,876
Sorry, I'm getting hungry.

1893
01:34:44,876 --> 01:34:46,292
Jobless and hungry?

1894
01:34:46,292 --> 01:34:47,959
Come on over,

1895
01:34:47,959 --> 01:34:49,667
let's celebrate.

1896
01:34:49,667 --> 01:34:50,334
Celebrate what?

1897
01:34:50,334 --> 01:34:51,709
Tempura wanted to resign, but he didn't.

1898
01:34:51,709 --> 01:34:52,917
Instead, he got promoted.

1899
01:34:52,917 --> 01:34:54,959
Oh? Yeah?

1900
01:34:55,084 --> 01:34:56,542
Wow-

1901
01:34:57,001 --> 01:34:59,084
That means you've got us
when the bill comes!

1902
01:34:59,084 --> 01:35:01,292
We'll never have to work at the clinic again!

1903
01:35:01,292 --> 01:35:04,417
Hey, how can you say that?

1904
01:35:04,417 --> 01:35:06,626
You still need a job of your own.

1905
01:35:06,626 --> 01:35:08,751
But a certain someone
hasn't worked in a long time,

1906
01:35:08,751 --> 01:35:10,917
because he's down in the dumps.

1907
01:35:12,459 --> 01:35:13,459
Wax-

1908
01:35:13,459 --> 01:35:14,292
Hmm?

1909
01:35:14,292 --> 01:35:16,084
You can't stay like this forever.

1910
01:35:16,084 --> 01:35:17,292
Starling wouldn't want

1911
01:35:17,292 --> 01:35:19,334
to see you like this.

1912
01:35:19,334 --> 01:35:21,751
I don't think she's gonna see him like that.

1913
01:35:21,959 --> 01:35:23,042
Hey!

1914
01:35:23,334 --> 01:35:24,417
You deserved it.

1915
01:35:27,042 --> 01:35:28,292
You better pull yourself together

1916
01:35:28,292 --> 01:35:30,626
if you're gonna win her back.

1917
01:35:30,626 --> 01:35:33,126
Jasmine, I can't do it.

1918
01:35:33,126 --> 01:35:35,251
How do you know if you don't try?

1919
01:35:35,251 --> 01:35:37,834
Look at that billboard.

1920
01:35:37,834 --> 01:35:38,876
It's fate that

1921
01:35:38,876 --> 01:35:40,876
brought you two together.

1922
01:35:40,876 --> 01:35:43,042
How can you give up so easily?

1923
01:35:43,042 --> 01:35:45,001
Just let it slip away?

1924
01:35:45,001 --> 01:35:47,042
You'd be a fool to do that.

1925
01:37:21,251 --> 01:37:22,334
Hi. Simon.

1926
01:37:22,334 --> 01:37:23,251
Hello.

1927
01:37:23,251 --> 01:37:26,084
Long time no see.

1928
01:37:26,084 --> 01:37:28,251
Starling, you're a beautiful dancer.

1929
01:37:28,417 --> 01:37:31,126
Starling, this is our Asian distributor, Simon.

1930
01:37:31,126 --> 01:37:31,792
Hi, how are you?

1931
01:37:32,501 --> 01:37:35,167
This is our overseas distributor.

1932
01:37:35,459 --> 01:37:38,584
Nice meeting you,
have you had a great time?

1933
01:37:38,584 --> 01:37:40,459
Starling, I was just telling your father

1934
01:37:40,459 --> 01:37:43,709
we a have a lot of movies
that'd be perfect for you.

1935
01:37:44,084 --> 01:37:46,042
Simon,
you should consider working with Starling.

1936
01:37:46,042 --> 01:37:47,959
You can arrange it through me.

1937
01:37:47,959 --> 01:37:49,501
Sure, sure, sure.

1938
01:37:49,501 --> 01:37:51,959
Please excuse me.
I need to return to my dressing room.

1939
01:37:51,959 --> 01:37:53,001
Yes, see you.

1940
01:37:53,001 --> 01:37:53,376
Thank you.

1941
01:37:53,376 --> 01:37:54,334
We love you very much.

1942
01:37:54,334 --> 01:37:55,459
Have yourselves a great time.

1943
01:37:56,709 --> 01:37:57,917
I'm going to go change clothes.

1944
01:37:57,917 --> 01:37:58,709
Okay.

1945
01:37:58,709 --> 01:37:59,376
See you.

1946
01:37:59,376 --> 01:37:59,834
Okay.

1947
01:38:17,292 --> 01:38:17,959
Wow

1948
01:38:17,959 --> 01:38:20,959
Wow, what a big event.

1949
01:38:20,959 --> 01:38:22,834
We should have borrowed Dr. Bo's car.

1950
01:38:25,001 --> 01:38:26,334
Hey, Wax.

1951
01:38:26,334 --> 01:38:27,459
Where you think you're going?

1952
01:38:27,459 --> 01:38:29,292
You won't get in dressed like that.

1953
01:38:29,292 --> 01:38:30,584
You're underdressed.

1954
01:38:30,584 --> 01:38:32,376
You need a Woodstock outfit like mine.

1955
01:38:32,376 --> 01:38:33,209
Pajamas?

1956
01:38:33,209 --> 01:38:34,542
It won't work.

1957
01:38:34,542 --> 01:38:37,167
Tempura,
you're always the best-dressed one.

1958
01:38:37,167 --> 01:38:37,709
Thank you.

1959
01:38:37,709 --> 01:38:38,126
You're welcome.

1960
01:38:38,126 --> 01:38:39,459
So, you should go in.

1961
01:38:39,459 --> 01:38:40,459
Me?

1962
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:44,251
Hey, Sir? Sir!

1963
01:38:44,251 --> 01:38:45,626
Hi Peter, what a coincidence!

1964
01:38:45,626 --> 01:38:46,376
You are?

1965
01:38:46,376 --> 01:38:47,667
Tempura.
You came for the premiere, too, huh?

1966
01:38:47,667 --> 01:38:48,084
Yes.

1967
01:38:48,084 --> 01:38:48,876
Shall we?

1968
01:38:51,001 --> 01:38:53,251
Yes! Get me a lobster while you're in there.

1969
01:38:53,542 --> 01:38:54,917
Let's go out back and watch.

1970
01:38:58,167 --> 01:39:01,834
There's a ton of media here today.

1971
01:39:02,251 --> 01:39:03,209
Hey, Bao.

1972
01:39:04,417 --> 01:39:07,376
Wax didn't come tonight did he?

1973
01:39:07,667 --> 01:39:09,751
He wouldn't dare.

1974
01:39:10,876 --> 01:39:11,584
William-

1975
01:39:11,959 --> 01:39:14,334
What would you have to bring up that kid for?

1976
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:18,126
He wouldn't come harrass Starling again,
would he?

1977
01:39:18,542 --> 01:39:19,792
No.

1978
01:39:20,292 --> 01:39:23,459
This afternoon, Big Red reminded me of him.

1979
01:39:24,126 --> 01:39:27,584
You know I hate being threatened.

1980
01:39:27,584 --> 01:39:31,876
Those people are no threat to you.

1981
01:39:31,876 --> 01:39:33,792
Big Red is easy to get rid of.

1982
01:39:33,792 --> 01:39:36,501
Just give him a little cash.

1983
01:39:36,501 --> 01:39:37,459
Am I right?

1984
01:39:38,084 --> 01:39:40,959
But Wax, on the other hand-

1985
01:39:41,501 --> 01:39:43,876
William, that really was clever

1986
01:39:43,876 --> 01:39:46,917
sending those photos to the newspaper

1987
01:39:46,917 --> 01:39:50,334
and getting his ass kicked.

1988
01:39:51,126 --> 01:39:52,792
What a smart move.

1989
01:39:53,251 --> 01:39:54,501
So it was you!

1990
01:39:55,042 --> 01:39:57,709
You made everyone believe it was Wax.

1991
01:39:59,792 --> 01:40:01,126
Bao, can you give us a moment?

1992
01:40:01,334 --> 01:40:02,542
Close the door behind you.

1993
01:40:12,334 --> 01:40:13,751
Didn't you believe it too?

1994
01:40:15,584 --> 01:40:17,834
Who are you blaming?

1995
01:40:17,834 --> 01:40:19,542
You're the one who didn't trust him.

1996
01:40:21,667 --> 01:40:23,667
You think you can slap me?

1997
01:40:24,209 --> 01:40:25,751
You really think you're a huge star.

1998
01:40:25,751 --> 01:40:26,709
Huh?

1999
01:40:28,459 --> 01:40:29,167
Where are you going?

2000
01:40:31,709 --> 01:40:33,501
You think you can run away?

2001
01:40:36,542 --> 01:40:38,917
Don't forget your father owes me money.

2002
01:40:38,917 --> 01:40:40,917
If I didn't pay off his gambling debts

2003
01:40:40,917 --> 01:40:43,126
he would have gone bankrupt.

2004
01:40:45,251 --> 01:40:46,876
Without me

2005
01:40:46,876 --> 01:40:49,084
you'd never have gotten a lead role.

2006
01:40:50,501 --> 01:40:52,042
And don't you forget it.

2007
01:40:52,584 --> 01:40:54,751
Listen-

2008
01:40:54,751 --> 01:40:57,292
The fact is, I own you.

2009
01:40:57,292 --> 01:40:58,501
You think you're better than everyone?

2010
01:40:58,501 --> 01:40:59,751
What do you want from me?

2011
01:41:01,084 --> 01:41:01,834
Go on, scream.

2012
01:41:01,834 --> 01:41:02,709
Go ahead, scream away!

2013
01:41:02,709 --> 01:41:04,126
Keep screaming! Starling!

2014
01:41:04,376 --> 01:41:05,167
Ha ha, it's not what you think.

2015
01:41:05,167 --> 01:41:06,709
That's Starling's voice.

2016
01:41:06,709 --> 01:41:08,001
Don't forget-

2017
01:41:08,001 --> 01:41:09,667
you owe William money, right?

2018
01:41:09,667 --> 01:41:10,959
Don't you get it?

2019
01:41:10,959 --> 01:41:12,417
Yes sir, Bao, I'll get the money.

2020
01:41:12,417 --> 01:41:14,042
Hey, listen to me.

2021
01:41:14,042 --> 01:41:16,084
It's like having a son-in-law.

2022
01:41:16,084 --> 01:41:17,876
You lucky bastard.

2023
01:41:17,876 --> 01:41:18,667
After this

2024
01:41:18,667 --> 01:41:20,626
think about all the money you'll have.

2025
01:41:20,626 --> 01:41:23,126
If you prefer the poor kid, then you're nuts.

2026
01:41:23,126 --> 01:41:26,876
I always get what I want.

2027
01:41:30,626 --> 01:41:33,667
Starling, Starling!

2028
01:41:33,667 --> 01:41:35,667
Starling! Open the door, William!

2029
01:41:35,667 --> 01:41:36,292
Dad!

2030
01:41:36,292 --> 01:41:36,917
William, I beg you.

2031
01:41:36,917 --> 01:41:37,626
Help!

2032
01:41:37,626 --> 01:41:39,417
What's wrong with you?

2033
01:41:39,709 --> 01:41:41,834
Bao, sir, I beg you.

2034
01:41:41,834 --> 01:41:43,126
Let Starling go!

2035
01:41:43,126 --> 01:41:44,959
I'll pay you back. I'm begging you.

2036
01:41:44,959 --> 01:41:46,167
That's enough already.

2037
01:41:49,251 --> 01:41:50,751
Starling, Starling!

2038
01:41:50,751 --> 01:41:51,959
William, William!

2039
01:42:18,501 --> 01:42:20,251
Help!

2040
01:42:23,626 --> 01:42:24,251
What do you want?

2041
01:42:25,251 --> 01:42:28,084
Go on, continue.

2042
01:42:28,084 --> 01:42:29,376
How dare you!

2043
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:31,876
You'll never make it out of Galilee.

2044
01:42:31,876 --> 01:42:35,376
I never planned on leaving.

2045
01:42:40,459 --> 01:42:41,459
What's taking so long?

2046
01:42:41,459 --> 01:42:43,876
Yeah, where's my lobster?

2047
01:42:44,459 --> 01:42:45,876
There's a guard at the door.

2048
01:42:45,876 --> 01:42:47,917
Hey, you guys go in from the window, okay?

2049
01:42:47,917 --> 01:42:50,126
Why are we always doing things like this?

2050
01:42:50,126 --> 01:42:52,084
Any other ideas?

2051
01:42:52,084 --> 01:42:52,417
Okay-

2052
01:42:52,417 --> 01:42:53,917
I'll do it for lobster.

2053
01:43:37,376 --> 01:43:38,167
Where are you going?

2054
01:43:40,667 --> 01:43:41,667
Shut up!

2055
01:43:46,376 --> 01:43:47,959
The movie has only just started.

2056
01:43:47,959 --> 01:43:49,584
What's the rush?

2057
01:43:51,626 --> 01:43:52,792
Reporters-

2058
01:43:53,251 --> 01:43:56,042
Come over to the center.

2059
01:43:56,042 --> 01:43:57,167
Come over here.

2060
01:43:57,876 --> 01:43:59,084
Get this on film.

2061
01:43:59,459 --> 01:44:00,709
It's a top story.

2062
01:44:00,709 --> 01:44:01,751
Why aren't you taking pictures?

2063
01:44:05,501 --> 01:44:06,709
Shoot!

2064
01:44:12,251 --> 01:44:14,792
Superstar William-

2065
01:44:15,959 --> 01:44:19,251
Come and tell everyone

2066
01:44:19,251 --> 01:44:21,167
what you were just trying to do.

2067
01:44:24,584 --> 01:44:27,084
Big Red, take it easy.

2068
01:44:27,542 --> 01:44:29,501
I'll go settle things with the mayor.

2069
01:44:29,501 --> 01:44:31,584
That's not what I want to hear you say.

2070
01:44:32,417 --> 01:44:34,126
I want you to explain
what you were just doing.

2071
01:44:36,001 --> 01:44:37,001
I-

2072
01:44:39,126 --> 01:44:40,542
Starling

2073
01:44:41,626 --> 01:44:43,167
I'm sorry.

2074
01:44:43,959 --> 01:44:45,667
Oh, now you're sorry?

2075
01:44:46,584 --> 01:44:48,584
Starling, do you accept his apology?

2076
01:44:48,584 --> 01:44:50,417
Huh?

2077
01:44:50,417 --> 01:44:52,876
This animal was trying to rape you just now.

2078
01:44:53,501 --> 01:44:54,834
You hate him, right? Come here.

2079
01:44:54,834 --> 01:44:57,001
Come on, don't be afraid.

2080
01:44:57,001 --> 01:44:58,167
Come here.

2081
01:44:59,001 --> 01:45:00,959
Take this knife. Take it!

2082
01:45:00,959 --> 01:45:01,792
Kill him.

2083
01:45:01,792 --> 01:45:02,626
Come on.

2084
01:45:03,251 --> 01:45:05,667
Do it, do it!

2085
01:45:18,292 --> 01:45:19,584
Starling

2086
01:45:19,584 --> 01:45:20,917
Starling, run!

2087
01:45:22,751 --> 01:45:24,834
Wax, you finally showed up.

2088
01:45:24,834 --> 01:45:27,126
I've been waiting.

2089
01:45:27,126 --> 01:45:29,876
Are you here for your brother?

2090
01:45:29,876 --> 01:45:31,167
Or for your lover?

2091
01:45:31,417 --> 01:45:32,792
Let them go.

2092
01:45:34,292 --> 01:45:36,876
I could kill you right here, right now.

2093
01:45:36,876 --> 01:45:38,584
But that that would be too quick.

2094
01:45:39,417 --> 01:45:40,709
And where's the fun in that?

2095
01:45:40,709 --> 01:45:42,417
You know it, too.

2096
01:45:43,334 --> 01:45:44,459
Right?

2097
01:45:45,334 --> 01:45:47,376
Give me a gun with just one bullet.

2098
01:45:47,376 --> 01:45:49,709
If you kill one of them,

2099
01:45:50,126 --> 01:45:52,376
I'll let the other one go.

2100
01:45:52,376 --> 01:45:56,376
Trust me, I'm a man of my word.

2101
01:45:57,459 --> 01:45:59,751
This is what happens to traitors.

2102
01:46:05,292 --> 01:46:06,126
Big Red-

2103
01:46:06,126 --> 01:46:07,417
Stay where you are.

2104
01:46:14,001 --> 01:46:16,209
She looks like she's in pain.

2105
01:46:17,001 --> 01:46:18,792
Do you want to relieve her of her pain?

2106
01:46:18,792 --> 01:46:20,376
Or save her?

2107
01:46:24,126 --> 01:46:26,792
Do you know why I kept you alive?

2108
01:46:27,459 --> 01:46:30,334
Because I want to see you
get killed by your brother.

2109
01:46:30,709 --> 01:46:32,584
You bastard!

2110
01:46:38,709 --> 01:46:42,126
Oh, I'm so scared.

2111
01:46:46,417 --> 01:46:49,042
Stop wasting time.

2112
01:46:49,042 --> 01:46:51,376
When the music stops, if you haven't decided

2113
01:46:52,751 --> 01:46:54,501
then you're all gonna die.

2114
01:48:10,417 --> 01:48:11,376
Hurry

2115
01:48:44,334 --> 01:48:45,792
Come on!

2116
01:50:06,501 --> 01:50:07,542
Are you hurt?

2117
01:50:07,542 --> 01:50:08,626
No

2118
01:50:26,292 --> 01:50:27,292
Get down.

2119
01:51:47,876 --> 01:51:49,376
Now what?

2120
01:51:50,626 --> 01:51:51,667
Don't be afraid.

2121
01:51:58,626 --> 01:52:00,001
What are you doing?

2122
01:52:01,292 --> 01:52:03,001
Keep it for me.

2123
01:52:03,001 --> 01:52:04,876
What?

2124
01:52:04,876 --> 01:52:06,167
Get out.

2125
01:52:06,167 --> 01:52:08,167
I don't want to.

2126
01:52:08,167 --> 01:52:09,167
Get out!

2127
01:52:09,167 --> 01:52:10,209
I don't want to.

2128
01:52:10,209 --> 01:52:10,792
Get out!

2129
01:52:10,792 --> 01:52:12,042
I don't want to.

2130
01:52:50,792 --> 01:52:53,167
Come on, keep on going!

2131
01:53:12,042 --> 01:53:14,709
If you really love her, then leave her.
