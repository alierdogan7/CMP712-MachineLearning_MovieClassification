1
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,475
From "Carmen", the novel, 1845.

2
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,197
In Spain,

3
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,592
for a woman to be thought beautiful,

4
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,351
she should have thirty positive qualities.

5
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,195
Or to put it another way,

6
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,234
it must be possible

7
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,916
to apply to her three adjectives,

8
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,830
each of which describes

9
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,391
ten parts of her person.

10
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,277
For example, three that are dark,

11
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,351
dark eyes,

12
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,480
dark eyelashes,

13
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,596
dark eyebrows.

14
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,074
Three that are delicate,

15
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,472
her hands,

16
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,232
her lips,

17
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,471
her hair, and so forth.

18
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,598
My woman could not lay claim
to such perfection.

19
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:46,993
Her eyes were slanting but remarkably wide,

20
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,957
her lips rather full but finely chiseled,

21
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,909
her hair rather coarse and black
with a sheen like a raven’s wing,

22
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,153
was long and shining.

23
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,153
Not to weary you
with too long a description,

24
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,516
I will sum her up by saying

25
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,837
that for every fault she had a quality

26
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,549
perhaps more striking from the contrast.

27
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,871
She had a strange wild beauty,

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,560
a face that was disconcerting
but unforgettable.

29
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,040
Her eyes in particular

30
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,396
had an expression
at once alluring and fierce,

31
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,154
that I had never seen
on any other human face.

32
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,874
Sorry I'm late.

33
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,391
-You shouldn’t park here.
-Show some respect.

34
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,159
Don’t make us angry!

35
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,470
They're full of crap.

36
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,556
Hot and dusty at the barracks

37
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,230
every day something to see

38
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,436
Watching people as they pass

39
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,359
Check out the girls and rate their butts!

40
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,469
Check out the girls!

41
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:49,277
Waiting at the fence, watching girls go by

42
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,276
We talk and smoke
hoping to catch their eye

43
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,351
Hot and dusty at the barracks

44
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,476
every day something to see

45
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,236
Watching people as they pass

46
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,108
Check out the girls and rate their butts!

47
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,479
Check out the girls!

48
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,270
Who’s this young girl?

49
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,035
It looks like our luck is in today

50
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,595
Young lady

51
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,480
we're here at your service

52
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,472
She needs our help!

53
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,438
Young lady, can I help you?

54
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,594
I'm looking for a sergeant

55
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,235
I'm a sergeant

56
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,948
Sir, I must tell you

57
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,838
the sergeant I'm looking for

58
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,036
is called Jongkhaya

59
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,117
Jongi? We all know Jongi

60
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,394
Thank God!

61
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,439
Is he here?

62
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,471
He’s not with us

63
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,199
He’s on the other watch

64
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,480
He isn’t here?

65
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,835
Sorry, my darling

66
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,115
Sorry, my baby

67
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,549
He isn’t here

68
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,558
But don’t go away

69
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,957
He won’t be long

70
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,239
Your special sergeant

71
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,480
will soon be here

72
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,480
He'll soon be here

73
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,480
Your special sergeant will be here

74
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,189
with the change of the watch

75
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,512
But to make the time seem shorter

76
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,870
stay with us a moment more

77
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,996
Come inside, see our quarters

78
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:34,480
You'll find a welcome there for sure

79
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,311
-In there?
-In there

80
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,072
I can’t go inside

81
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,950
but thanks, anyway

82
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:51,353
Pretty girl, don’t be frightened

83
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,389
We respect your point of view

84
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,950
You will find us welcoming

85
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:09,552
We'll take extra care of you

86
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,149
No doubt you would

87
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,480
Even so I have to go

88
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,391
I cannot stay

89
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,072
I shall return

90
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,037
to see my precious sergeant

91
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,113
arriving with the change of watch

92
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,599
Stay here with us

93
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,552
You'll see your precious sergeant

94
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,037
arriving with the change of watch

95
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,838
-Stay here with us!
-I can’t, I can’t!

96
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,035
Stay here with us!

97
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,151
Don’t go away, don’t go!

98
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,471
Kind sirs, I must go!

99
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,195
You let her get away...

100
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,508
No, it was you.

101
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,151
Our girl has flown

102
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,117
We're on our own

103
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,033
Waiting at the gate

104
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,477
Back where we were

105
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,480
Hot and dusty in the barracks

106
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,391
Every day something to see

107
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,311
Watching people as they pass

108
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,109
Check out the girls and rate their butts

109
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,198
Check out the girls!

110
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,989
hey, Jongkhaya,

111
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,115
you're in luck.

112
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,237
You've a babe looking for you.

113
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,912
I don’t know any women here.

114
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,515
What did she look like?

115
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,114
Fit enough, nice body,

116
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,313
but dresses as if she’s from the rural areas.

117
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,435
Nomakhaya?

118
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,595
Didn’t ask her name,

119
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,996
I was too busy looking...

120
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,469
Gentlemen...

121
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,436
Let’s take a look
round this township of yours.

122
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,839
Sergeant, let’s go.

123
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,468
it’s peaceful for your first day, sir.

124
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,471
What goes on in there?

125
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,476
That? Cigarette factory, sir.

126
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,591
We're really past apartheid now.

127
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,909
Factories...

128
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,879
Factories in townships...

129
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,188
Women workers?

130
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,918
That’s right, sir.

131
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,992
Lots of them,

132
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,480
rolling cigarettes all day long.

133
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,595
You wait, sir,

134
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,229
it’s lunchtime now,

135
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,312
the guys will come running.

136
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,475
But not you?

137
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,359
They're township girls,

138
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,149
not my type.

139
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,356
There’s the bell, sir. Judge for yourself.

140
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,351
Can we go closer, sir?

141
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,475
Okay, let’s go.

142
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,040
Now the bell has rung

143
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,475
Now their break has started

144
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,480
All the factory girls

145
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,278
will come out here

146
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,999
Come to us, you girls

147
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,548
Do yourselves a favour

148
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,879
Let us say the kind of things
you'd like to hear

149
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,268
Let us whisper words of love in your ear

150
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,439
Loving words in your ear

151
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,469
I smoke like a nervous wreck.

152
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,391
it’s your own fault.

153
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:03,993
Look here they come

154
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:11,992
hot and sexy

155
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,278
They're keen, I'll bet

156
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,553
See the smoke from our cigarettes

157
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,308
fill the air

158
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,480
It rises higher still

159
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,473
and its perfume lingers there

160
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,871
Soon it wafts through your senses

161
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,272
captivating

162
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,113
How powerful that scent is

163
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,911
How intoxicating

164
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,471
A man’s promise like smoke

165
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,395
will soon disappear

166
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,076
Promises in your ear
Like smoke will disappear

167
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,472
Loving words simply disappear

168
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,516
See our smoke disperse

169
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,114
See the smoke disappear

170
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,069
Disappear

171
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,399
Disperse in the air

172
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,392
with its heady perfume

173
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,155
Our smoke will soon disappear

174
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,480
Amanda, where is Carmen?

175
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,152
Carmen’s around.

176
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,114
is she still in there?

177
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,480
Where is she?

178
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,118
Where’s Carmen?

179
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,354
She’s in there

180
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,913
Here she is!

181
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,471
Look at us

182
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,040
Won’t you speak to us

183
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:08,474
and say when you'll give us your love?

184
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,472
You ask when I'll love you?

185
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,948
Who knows? I don’t

186
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,909
Tomorrow perhaps

187
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,389
or never

188
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,471
who knows

189
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,152
It won’t be today

190
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,950
That’s for sure!

191
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:51,480
Love’s a bird that no one tames

192
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,480
No sooner caged than it flies away

193
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,480
No one can control it

194
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,480
No one can contain it

195
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,480
Love won’t be begged or threatened

196
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,429
Love won’t surrender to the loudest calls

197
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,349
It’s the keen one who'll fail

198
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,958
and the cool one who'll take the prize

199
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,352
Love’s a bird that no one tames

200
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,560
no sooner caged than it flies away

201
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,118
No one can control it

202
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,558
No one can contain it

203
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,834
I ignore all the rules

204
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,550
Love’s a stranger to me

205
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:02,198
If you don’t want me then I'm yours

206
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,990
But if I want you then be afraid

207
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,310
Beware her love!

208
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:17,239
If you don’t want me then I'm yours

209
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,276
Beware her love!

210
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:27,472
But if I want you

211
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,119
you'd best be afraid

212
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,951
I ignore all the rules

213
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,830
Love’s a stranger to me

214
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,835
If you don’t want me then I'm yours

215
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,480
But if I want you then beware

216
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,074
Beware her love!

217
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:03,352
If you don’t want me then I'm yours

218
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,431
Beware her love!

219
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:12,875
But if I want you

220
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,988
you'd best beware!

221
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,435
If you try to capture love

222
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,235
away it flies, you can see it go

223
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,871
Look for love when it’s hidden

224
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,511
You'll suffer and live in hell

225
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,480
All around you, feel love surround you

226
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,235
You're trapped within its timeless spell

227
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,348
If you seek love, it confounds you

228
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,480
You'll suffer, it gives you hell

229
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,270
If you try to capture love

230
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,354
away it flies, you can see it go

231
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,389
Look for love and it’s gone

232
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,270
Abandon it and it’s yours

233
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,831
I ignore all the rules

234
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:35,480
Love’s a stranger to me

235
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,873
If you don’t want me then I'm yours

236
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,351
But if I want you then be afraid

237
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,276
If you don’t want me

238
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,478
If you don’t want me then I'm yours

239
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,352
But if I want you

240
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:10,031
if I want you, you'd best beware!

241
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,350
If you don’t want me

242
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,592
If you don’t want me then I'm yours

243
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,916
Beware her love!

244
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,878
But if I love you

245
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:55,471
if I love you, you'd best beware!

246
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,480
I ignore all the rules

247
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,994
Love’s a stranger to me

248
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,514
If you don’t want me then I'm yours

249
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,477
But if I want you then beware!

250
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,189
You better use this condom
if you want her...

251
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,118
Carmen is so irritating,
she’s always showing off.

252
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,436
I can smell trouble.

253
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,116
He’s returned home,

254
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,556
and will perform in Cape Town

255
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,114
with the Gypsy Cigarette Girls Choir.

256
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,430
They'll be conducted

257
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,118
by his cousin, Andile Nkomo.

258
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,873
Stay tuned to see a recent performance.

259
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,435
Sergeant.

260
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,273
Who’s there?

261
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,475
-Why are you here?
-Your mother sent me.

262
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,594
My mother sent you?

263
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,112
How is my mother?

264
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,439
I am her messenger

265
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,994
She sent a letter

266
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,149
A letter?

267
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,390
And these as well

268
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,314
A ring for you to keep with this photo

269
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,918
And more

270
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,480
There’s more?

271
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,235
And more, I dare not tell you

272
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,073
She asked if I would give you

273
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,037
something more

274
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,270
Something else besides

275
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,432
which you, her loving son

276
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,040
would treasure more than these

277
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,951
What is this something

278
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,998
Nomakhaya, won’t you tell?

279
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,311
The gift your mother gave

280
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,393
is on my lips

281
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,109
for me to give to you

282
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,109
Last Sunday after church

283
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,475
she took me in her arms

284
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:54,398
and bid me come to you today

285
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,479
She said to me, "Nomakhaya

286
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,910
"please go to Seville

287
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,275
"It isn’t very far

288
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,430
"and when you're there

289
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,474
"find my son, my dear child

290
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,315
"My son, my Jongi

291
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,432
"Tell him that his mother

292
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,315
"says a prayer for him night and day"

293
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,470
She has never recovered

294
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:39,197
from the day you went away

295
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:44,195
"Tell him how I miss him

296
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:49,480
"How I long to see him"

297
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:54,480
She asked me to embrace you

298
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,077
She asked me to kiss you on her behalf

299
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,310
You've a kiss from my mother?

300
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,594
A kiss for you

301
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,480
You've a kiss from my mother?

302
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:09,029
I gave my word

303
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,159
Her kiss I'd give to you

304
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,957
My mother, I see her now

305
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,589
I see my mother once again

306
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,839
I see the village

307
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:38,835
where we lived then

308
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:45,996
He sees his mother once again

309
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:53,111
He sees our village

310
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:59,833
These memories fill his heart with courage

311
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:04,198
These treasured memories of home

312
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:09,480
fill my heart with courage

313
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,596
Beloved mother

314
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,836
I see the village

315
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,595
Sweet memories of home

316
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,151
Marriage is a blessing from God.

317
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,471
You will be blessed for eternity.

318
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,268
Now let me hear amen.

319
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,271
Yes, brothers and sisters,

320
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,476
adultery is a great sin.

321
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,399
Come for a swim.

322
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,480
I can’t swim.

323
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,515
Come, I’ll teach you.

324
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,591
I’m scared.

325
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:57,516
Sweet memories of home

326
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,511
I can’t swim.

327
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,355
You show no respect to my wife.

328
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,476
Don’t think like that...

329
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,232
I’m serous.

330
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,314
You're being stupid.

331
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,879
Don’t call me stupid.

332
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,035
You have my sympathy.

333
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,469
What did you say?

334
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,312
I told them the truth.

335
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,315
We went swimming and he sipped.

336
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,313
Mother, I...

337
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,548
Today

338
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,471
I lost both my sons.

339
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,355
I’m washing my hands of you.

340
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:28,193
Leave me.

341
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,910
Leave me to grieve.

342
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,914
My dear son,

343
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,111
take care of yourself.

344
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:02,036
I hope one day you'll come home.

345
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,197
When you choose a wife,

346
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,437
let it be your brother’s widow.

347
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,268
From your dear mother.

348
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,199
I have to go.

349
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,395
Wait, Nomakhaya

350
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,232
Really, I have to go.

351
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,469
They're killing each other.

352
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,834
Who? Where?

353
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,148
At the factory.

354
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,475
Come and help!

355
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,954
Come and help us now!

356
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,993
It was Carmen who started the fight

357
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,957
No, it wasn’t her!

358
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,480
Yes, it was her!

359
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,232
She struck out first

360
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,390
No, that’s a bloody lie

361
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,150
Listen to us!

362
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,992
We'll tell how it was

363
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,593
It was Carmen

364
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,480
who started the fight

365
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,833
It was Manelisa

366
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,478
who started the fight

367
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,115
It was Carmensitha!

368
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,838
It was Manelisa!

369
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,433
Now, will someone please tell me

370
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,391
what’s been gong on in there?

371
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,469
There was a fight.

372
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,120
This girl got stabbed with this knife.

373
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,874
By who?

374
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,109
By her.

375
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,479
I don’t have to answer to you.

376
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,358
I’ll answer real police, not you rookies.

377
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,480
Rookies

378
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,833
Maybe they are,

379
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,480
but take a good look at me.

380
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,035
Answer.

381
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:20,033
-The bitch attacked me first.
-it’s you who attacked first, stupid bitch.

382
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,480
There was a fight

383
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,198
and that one got stabbed.

384
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,480
What do you have to say for yourself?

385
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,469
Answer.

386
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,118
Sergeant, watch her.

387
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,594
You're hurting me.

388
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,470
Then don’t give me trouble.

389
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,393
Then let me go.

390
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,551
Why would I do that?

391
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,119
Because my mother lives alone
in the rural areas.

392
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,474
She needs me.

393
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,993
honestly. You're from there, aren’t you?

394
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,072
Won’t you help me?

395
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,000
Don’t play games.
You're not a township girl?

396
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,998
Of course not.

397
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,356
You really think I’ll help you?

398
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,990
You'll do what I want, sooner or later.

399
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,198
I go to church too.

400
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,959
Don’t make me laugh.

401
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,838
"Love your neighbour,"
that’s what the Bible says.

402
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,390
Oh, you kept the flower...

403
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:09,389
I’ve enchanted you.

404
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,593
Stop talking.

405
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,476
Sergeant, take her away

406
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,473
In the hottest part of the township

407
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,308
with my friend Bra Nkomo

408
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,597
is where I dance the Twalatsa

409
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,156
and drink sputla

410
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,913
at Bra Nkomo’s shebeen

411
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,119
But being alone is hardly fun

412
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,952
it’s best if there’s another one

413
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,837
since pleasure is for two

414
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,480
I'd like to take my lover there

415
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,480
What am I saying?

416
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,948
He was a liar and a cheat

417
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,110
I've finished with him!

418
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:39,232
My heart is breaking, who'll comfort me?

419
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,480
There are loads of men who want me

420
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,358
but none of them can turn me on

421
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,399
Is there no one who can?

422
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,870
Show me that man

423
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,077
I'd love him well

424
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:59,073
Who wants me? Who wants my heart?

425
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,596
Now’s your chance, make your move

426
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,075
I won’t hang around

427
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,480
you know where I'm going

428
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,837
In the hottest part of the township

429
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,480
with my friend Bra Nkomo

430
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,075
that’s where I dance the Twalatsa

431
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,833
and drink sputla

432
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,473
Every Sunday I go to Bra Nkomo’s!

433
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,195
Shut up!

434
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,999
Don’t talk to me

435
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,873
It’s not to you I speak

436
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:43,229
I'm singing to amuse myself

437
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:48,156
And I'm thinking

438
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:53,234
I take it I'm still allowed to think

439
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,480
I've got a man in mind

440
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,952
a certain man in mind

441
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:08,437
a gorgeous man who loves me

442
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:16,034
and who in time I could love

443
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:22,511
This man is not a captain

444
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,991
or an officer

445
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,996
He’s only a sergeant

446
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,914
full of passion

447
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,480
and I want to make him mine

448
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,233
I'm losing my senses

449
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:45,480
If I give myself to you

450
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,480
can I trust you

451
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,040
and if I love you

452
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:56,910
you must love me

453
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,957
I will save you

454
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,480
You'll dance with me

455
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,469
Give me your word

456
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,919
the Twalatsa

457
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,072
and we'll drink sputla

458
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,355
Give me your word

459
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,994
In the hottest part of the township

460
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,480
with my friend Bra Nkomo

461
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,995
that’s where I dance the Twalatsa

462
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,913
and drink sputla

463
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:25,197
I ignore all laws

464
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:31,116
Love’s a stranger to me

465
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:37,480
If you don’t want me then I'm yours

466
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:43,350
but if I want you, then be afraid

467
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:52,879
If you don’t love me

468
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,829
then I'm yours

469
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:06,548
But if I love you

470
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:14,197
you'd best beware

471
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,276
hey, shut up

472
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,956
Your singing is so bad...

473
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,035
Stop or I’ll shoot

474
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,471
Leave him alone

475
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:57,480
Listen, son of my son,

476
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,119
the comrades will take good care of you.

477
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,040
Don’t cry, child,

478
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,036
they are good friends.

479
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,477
Go well. Go well.

480
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,994
Don’t give Thand trouble.

481
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,957
Mum’s gong to Bra Nkomo’s.

482
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,437
Your mum’s gong dancing...

483
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,480
Don’t worry, child, I’ll be back.

484
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,438
We'll see about that

485
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,119
Where’s my hair band?

486
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,471
Let’s go.

487
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,878
Why such a hurry?

488
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,235
I want to see Luiamie

489
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,474
I’m gonna drink myself to death today.

490
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:38,472
Carmen, you're mad,
the police are still looking for you.

491
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:42,308
So what Frigging police.

492
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:08,475
The drums begin to beat

493
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:13,475
a rhythm slowly starts

494
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:19,237
The girls get to their feet

495
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:24,155
and move towards the stage

496
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:34,838
Marimbas are heard

497
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:39,480
and guitars take up the tune

498
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:44,110
The swirling music

499
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:49,194
surrounds you with sound

500
00:55:45,605 --> 00:55:52,397
Golden jewelry flashing and shining

501
00:55:52,605 --> 00:55:59,477
Colourful clothes swirling
faster than the wind

502
00:56:03,005 --> 00:56:06,236
There’s no escaping from the music now

503
00:56:06,605 --> 00:56:09,995
the dance has found its rhythm

504
00:56:10,085 --> 00:56:12,724
At first tentative

505
00:56:13,005 --> 00:56:14,605
but soon spinning around

506
00:56:14,605 --> 00:56:20,680
and round and round

507
00:56:20,965 --> 00:56:22,717
and round!

508
00:56:57,285 --> 00:57:00,038
The fever grips the band as well

509
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,958
Musicians play as though possessed

510
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:05,639
They're captivated like the rest

511
00:57:05,725 --> 00:57:08,319
For none can resist the music’s spell

512
00:57:11,445 --> 00:57:14,243
The frenzy holds them in a trance

513
00:57:14,325 --> 00:57:16,998
to break away there’s not a chance

514
00:57:17,085 --> 00:57:19,394
They're drunk on the rhythm

515
00:57:19,485 --> 00:57:21,123
they're lost

516
00:57:21,205 --> 00:57:22,638
turning and swaying

517
00:57:22,725 --> 00:57:27,958
they're intoxicated by the dance!

518
00:58:26,245 --> 00:58:27,598
Come here.

519
00:58:58,085 --> 00:58:59,598
Gentlemen, please,

520
00:58:59,965 --> 00:59:01,284
we don’t want trouble.

521
00:59:01,365 --> 00:59:04,994
We're celebrating my cousin’s return.

522
00:59:05,085 --> 00:59:06,564
No trouble please.

523
00:59:06,605 --> 00:59:09,677
This shithole is full of lowlifes,

524
00:59:09,965 --> 00:59:12,957
even our little jailbird here.

525
00:59:13,725 --> 00:59:15,556
I’ve never been to jai.

526
00:59:18,605 --> 00:59:23,121
Only because that bastard let you go.

527
00:59:23,205 --> 00:59:24,604
he seemed okay to me...

528
00:59:25,725 --> 00:59:27,443
What happened to him?

529
00:59:28,165 --> 00:59:31,601
Confined to barracks.

530
00:59:32,605 --> 00:59:34,641
he’s out today,

531
00:59:36,325 --> 00:59:38,600
but I demoted him.

532
00:59:39,605 --> 00:59:41,323
That’s fine by me,

533
00:59:41,725 --> 00:59:44,444
I prefer men...

534
00:59:44,525 --> 00:59:46,595
Officers can’t give you anything.

535
01:00:09,485 --> 01:00:13,603
in return for sex I’ll forget everything...

536
01:00:15,725 --> 01:00:17,317
Yes or no?

537
01:00:30,285 --> 01:00:33,402
I’ll decide when and where.

538
01:00:38,525 --> 01:00:40,197
I’ll see you soon...

539
01:01:00,485 --> 01:01:02,521
he’s here

540
01:01:04,005 --> 01:01:07,600
his car is coming

541
01:01:34,045 --> 01:01:38,084
Welcome to the son of KwaJola!

542
01:01:48,685 --> 01:01:51,153
Welcome to the son of KwaJola!

543
01:05:16,085 --> 01:05:18,519
You sing well.

544
01:05:20,405 --> 01:05:21,724
What’s your name?

545
01:05:24,965 --> 01:05:26,523
My name is Carmen.

546
01:05:27,085 --> 01:05:29,155
My friends call me Carmenstha.

547
01:05:29,605 --> 01:05:32,677
Carmenstha. You've a beautiful voce.

548
01:05:33,525 --> 01:05:37,279
I think we'll see more of each other.

549
01:05:37,365 --> 01:05:39,560
in your dreams.

550
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:43,121
Nothing wrong with dreaming...

551
01:05:43,605 --> 01:05:45,675
Dreams of my father brought me home.

552
01:05:47,165 --> 01:05:48,598
Give me a smoke.

553
01:06:21,605 --> 01:06:22,958
Lades,

554
01:06:23,525 --> 01:06:25,322
the guys want to talk.

555
01:06:26,125 --> 01:06:27,683
What’s up?

556
01:06:28,325 --> 01:06:29,553
Come.

557
01:06:30,605 --> 01:06:33,278
Can you take them home?

558
01:06:52,965 --> 01:06:54,284
Listen up.

559
01:06:54,365 --> 01:06:59,075
You have to help us with Customs.

560
01:07:04,965 --> 01:07:08,002
if we throw them a beach party,

561
01:07:08,085 --> 01:07:09,598
they'll let us through.

562
01:07:18,605 --> 01:07:23,474
There are boxes of these coming in by boat.

563
01:07:27,165 --> 01:07:29,599
So it’s agreed, you'll help us.

564
01:07:35,645 --> 01:07:38,557
Police, police

565
01:07:55,125 --> 01:07:56,604
Come back, you cowards

566
01:07:57,125 --> 01:07:58,478
he’s with me.

567
01:08:14,165 --> 01:08:15,598
You made it then.

568
01:08:16,165 --> 01:08:17,484
Of course

569
01:08:18,085 --> 01:08:20,201
how could I not?

570
01:08:23,965 --> 01:08:25,603
You took your time...

571
01:08:28,165 --> 01:08:29,996
I was confined to barracks.

572
01:08:31,605 --> 01:08:33,277
have you forgiven me?

573
01:08:34,605 --> 01:08:35,674
Of course.

574
01:08:37,485 --> 01:08:39,123
how could you ask that?

575
01:08:42,605 --> 01:08:44,357
I love you.

576
01:08:47,205 --> 01:08:48,604
They all say that...

577
01:08:51,405 --> 01:08:52,633
Who does?

578
01:08:54,405 --> 01:08:55,633
Who says that?

579
01:08:57,365 --> 01:08:59,196
Don’t tell me you're jealous

580
01:08:59,685 --> 01:09:01,357
Don’t be stupid.

581
01:09:11,605 --> 01:09:13,960
I’ll make you forget about the past.

582
01:09:17,565 --> 01:09:18,600
St down.

583
01:09:21,725 --> 01:09:25,115
I want to show you how we please our men.

584
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,598
Relax, Jong,

585
01:09:31,965 --> 01:09:33,603
and let me please you...

586
01:11:51,045 --> 01:11:52,683
Carmen, shut up

587
01:11:52,965 --> 01:11:54,717
I’m called to barracks at once.

588
01:12:01,085 --> 01:12:06,239
How could I be so stupid?

589
01:12:08,605 --> 01:12:14,601
I've made a fool of myself

590
01:12:15,605 --> 01:12:18,199
I made all the moves

591
01:12:18,285 --> 01:12:20,605
I gave all I had

592
01:12:20,605 --> 01:12:24,644
Tried everything to please you

593
01:12:26,605 --> 01:12:28,482
I danced

594
01:12:28,565 --> 01:12:30,362
and I sang

595
01:12:30,445 --> 01:12:33,198
I thought after time

596
01:12:33,285 --> 01:12:36,994
you'd be mine

597
01:12:37,405 --> 01:12:38,474
Tara tata!

598
01:12:38,565 --> 01:12:40,362
The radio is bleating

599
01:12:40,445 --> 01:12:41,560
Tara tata!

600
01:12:41,605 --> 01:12:43,482
He’s going to be late!

601
01:12:43,565 --> 01:12:46,159
Oh, my God!

602
01:12:46,245 --> 01:12:48,634
The radio is bleating

603
01:12:48,725 --> 01:12:51,603
He'll be late, he'll be late!

604
01:12:52,205 --> 01:12:54,594
He drops his woman

605
01:12:55,645 --> 01:12:57,601
and runs

606
01:12:57,645 --> 01:13:02,639
Well, so much for his love

607
01:13:04,045 --> 01:13:06,275
Don’t doubt my love

608
01:13:06,365 --> 01:13:07,400
What love?

609
01:13:07,485 --> 01:13:08,964
Listen to me

610
01:13:09,045 --> 01:13:11,081
It’s no use

611
01:13:11,165 --> 01:13:12,200
Listen to me

612
01:13:12,285 --> 01:13:14,116
Men are always lying

613
01:13:14,205 --> 01:13:17,595
Hear me out!

614
01:13:18,365 --> 01:13:20,640
Shut your mouth

615
01:13:22,325 --> 01:13:24,605
and hear me out!

616
01:13:24,605 --> 01:13:26,402
Get a grip on yourself

617
01:13:51,525 --> 01:13:58,476
Look, here’s the flower that you gave me

618
01:13:58,605 --> 01:14:06,478
I keep it here and dream of you

619
01:14:07,085 --> 01:14:14,321
All the days I was confined

620
01:14:15,285 --> 01:14:22,282
it never lost its treasured smell

621
01:14:25,045 --> 01:14:31,598
Beside me through each passing hour

622
01:14:32,285 --> 01:14:38,474
I could feel your love in this flower

623
01:14:39,325 --> 01:14:46,322
When I thought about you

624
01:14:46,405 --> 01:14:50,637
I closed my eyes

625
01:14:51,085 --> 01:14:55,397
and you were there

626
01:14:57,005 --> 01:15:02,602
At times I cursed the day I met you

627
01:15:03,085 --> 01:15:09,399
I'd call out your name and reject you

628
01:15:11,445 --> 01:15:19,159
What evil forces were at play

629
01:15:20,725 --> 01:15:27,563
on that fateful day?

630
01:15:28,165 --> 01:15:33,114
My life is empty without you

631
01:15:33,205 --> 01:15:38,325
It was blasphemy to doubt you

632
01:15:38,405 --> 01:15:43,081
My guilt weighed me down

633
01:15:46,005 --> 01:15:48,121
Oh, Carmen, my love

634
01:15:48,205 --> 01:15:52,562
my only desire was to see you

635
01:15:52,605 --> 01:15:57,440
to see you again

636
01:15:57,525 --> 01:16:04,044
I love you desperately

637
01:16:04,405 --> 01:16:11,197
please just look at me

638
01:16:11,525 --> 01:16:17,236
How can I make you understand?

639
01:16:18,725 --> 01:16:21,319
Please, Carmen

640
01:16:25,365 --> 01:16:32,123
You hold my life in your hands!

641
01:16:40,165 --> 01:16:47,196
I love you

642
01:17:10,165 --> 01:17:14,602
No, you don’t love me

643
01:17:14,685 --> 01:17:16,243
Yes, I do

644
01:17:16,325 --> 01:17:20,238
No, you don’t love me

645
01:17:22,605 --> 01:17:26,605
If you loved me

646
01:17:26,605 --> 01:17:32,475
you'd never
You'd never leave me

647
01:17:33,645 --> 01:17:36,284
Forget the police

648
01:17:37,725 --> 01:17:40,285
Come with us, stay with us

649
01:17:40,365 --> 01:17:42,117
I beg you

650
01:17:42,205 --> 01:17:44,196
Forget your duty

651
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:46,003
Show you care!

652
01:17:46,085 --> 01:17:47,404
Set me free

653
01:17:47,485 --> 01:17:49,601
Forget the police

654
01:17:49,645 --> 01:17:56,483
and show you truly love me

655
01:17:56,965 --> 01:17:59,604
Carmen, I beg you please

656
01:17:59,685 --> 01:18:02,199
have mercy on me

657
01:18:02,285 --> 01:18:04,435
-Save me
-Show me you care

658
01:18:04,525 --> 01:18:06,481
-Dear God
-And come with me

659
01:18:06,565 --> 01:18:09,318
Listen to me

660
01:18:09,405 --> 01:18:12,605
Show me you care

661
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:17,520
If you say you love me

662
01:18:17,605 --> 01:18:24,317
You'll love me

663
01:18:36,205 --> 01:18:39,641
No! I cannot do as you say

664
01:18:39,725 --> 01:18:41,477
Just think of the shame

665
01:18:41,645 --> 01:18:45,320
The failure of deserting

666
01:18:45,405 --> 01:18:46,599
the dishonour
of deserting the police!

667
01:18:47,365 --> 01:18:48,400
I can’t do it

668
01:18:49,405 --> 01:18:50,599
Well, then go!

669
01:18:50,685 --> 01:18:52,605
I implore you

670
01:18:52,605 --> 01:18:53,640
I don’t love you anymore

671
01:18:53,725 --> 01:18:55,681
-I beg you
-Piss off!

672
01:18:56,205 --> 01:19:00,483
You make me sick

673
01:19:00,965 --> 01:19:05,243
I'm leaving you

674
01:19:05,325 --> 01:19:09,523
Forever

675
01:19:09,605 --> 01:19:10,594
Get out

676
01:19:12,605 --> 01:19:15,403
Farewell

677
01:19:15,965 --> 01:19:19,594
Forever

678
01:19:20,405 --> 01:19:21,554
Farewell!

679
01:19:21,605 --> 01:19:22,594
Get out!

680
01:19:31,605 --> 01:19:33,482
What does he want?

681
01:19:33,565 --> 01:19:35,044
Be quiet

682
01:19:49,965 --> 01:19:51,605
What’s this?

683
01:19:51,605 --> 01:19:53,516
You disappoint me

684
01:19:53,605 --> 01:19:56,563
Shame on you!

685
01:19:56,605 --> 01:20:01,395
Giving in to a common sergeant

686
01:20:01,485 --> 01:20:03,999
while the Officer’s around

687
01:20:04,605 --> 01:20:06,323
Push off, get out now!

688
01:20:06,405 --> 01:20:07,394
No!

689
01:20:07,725 --> 01:20:10,080
You heard, I said get out

690
01:20:10,165 --> 01:20:12,281
I will not leave

691
01:20:12,365 --> 01:20:13,718
You fool

692
01:20:15,525 --> 01:20:16,640
If you're a man then fight!

693
01:20:39,165 --> 01:20:41,633
Brave officer

694
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:45,473
My hero

695
01:20:46,485 --> 01:20:52,594
It looks like love has played
a little game with you

696
01:20:53,405 --> 01:20:56,556
Your timing wasn’t good

697
01:20:56,605 --> 01:20:59,517
in this location

698
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:02,324
We want no trouble

699
01:21:02,405 --> 01:21:07,240
So you give us no choice but to detain you

700
01:21:07,325 --> 01:21:10,044
indefinitely!

701
01:21:18,005 --> 01:21:20,565
Are you with us?

702
01:21:20,605 --> 01:21:21,720
Now I have no choice

703
01:21:23,605 --> 01:21:25,516
You still have your doubts?

704
01:21:25,605 --> 01:21:27,277
Don’t worry

705
01:21:27,365 --> 01:21:30,675
very soon you'll have more chances

706
01:21:30,965 --> 01:21:34,196
Stay with us, don’t change your mind

707
01:21:34,285 --> 01:21:37,322
You can be whoever you want to be

708
01:21:37,405 --> 01:21:40,602
Live in liberty and enjoy your life

709
01:21:40,685 --> 01:21:42,482
you can be free!

710
01:21:42,565 --> 01:21:45,125
Yes, you'll be free!

711
01:21:45,205 --> 01:21:46,718
Stay, don’t try to resist

712
01:21:47,005 --> 01:21:48,605
as your life is changing

713
01:21:48,605 --> 01:21:51,995
Stay with us and be free

714
01:21:52,085 --> 01:21:53,643
Your path will be clear

715
01:21:53,725 --> 01:21:55,397
you'll have many more chances

716
01:21:55,485 --> 01:21:58,557
you'll be whoever you want to be

717
01:21:58,605 --> 01:22:02,041
Best of all you'll live in liberty

718
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:04,320
You'll be free

719
01:22:04,485 --> 01:22:09,479
You'll be free!

720
01:22:10,285 --> 01:22:12,594
I'll follow you

721
01:22:13,605 --> 01:22:15,596
I'll be free

722
01:22:20,285 --> 01:22:26,076
The most important thing of all

723
01:22:26,165 --> 01:22:31,523
is freedom

724
01:22:31,605 --> 01:22:36,201
Freedom!

725
01:24:27,485 --> 01:24:30,522
You were too quick to accept a ring
from that bastard.

726
01:24:32,125 --> 01:24:34,116
he'll hurt you again.

727
01:24:36,085 --> 01:24:38,155
he uses the Bible to hide his true nature.

728
01:24:38,365 --> 01:24:40,720
he'll beat you again.

729
01:25:43,605 --> 01:25:47,075
We'll go check out the sailor boys.

730
01:25:47,565 --> 01:25:49,521
You babes wait here.

731
01:25:50,605 --> 01:25:52,402
Where do you think you're gong?

732
01:25:52,605 --> 01:25:53,958
You wait too.

733
01:25:54,725 --> 01:25:56,204
Police boy

734
01:26:21,325 --> 01:26:23,043
Tell us, tell us

735
01:26:24,565 --> 01:26:27,716
what did the signs show?

736
01:26:28,485 --> 01:26:31,716
Talk to us about the signs

737
01:26:32,005 --> 01:26:35,520
What did they show?

738
01:26:42,525 --> 01:26:46,200
Amathambo, show us

739
01:26:46,285 --> 01:26:50,119
what our destiny may hold

740
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:52,082
Who we should be wary of?

741
01:26:53,725 --> 01:26:55,636
Will we ever fall in love?

742
01:26:57,605 --> 01:26:59,641
Amathambo will tell

743
01:27:00,045 --> 01:27:03,605
Tell us who to be wary of

744
01:27:03,605 --> 01:27:06,677
and whether we'll ever fall in love

745
01:27:09,605 --> 01:27:11,197
Such riches

746
01:27:12,965 --> 01:27:14,603
Such love

747
01:27:20,405 --> 01:27:23,605
Let me see

748
01:27:23,605 --> 01:27:30,078
what the signs showed to me

749
01:27:43,525 --> 01:27:46,483
Rubbish! Lies!

750
01:27:57,725 --> 01:28:01,957
It’s death, death is coming

751
01:28:02,125 --> 01:28:03,604
First for me

752
01:28:03,645 --> 01:28:06,159
then for him

753
01:28:06,245 --> 01:28:09,605
For both of us

754
01:28:09,605 --> 01:28:12,597
It’s death

755
01:28:35,725 --> 01:28:41,721
I've been trying to change

756
01:28:42,165 --> 01:28:47,319
what the amathambo showed

757
01:28:48,205 --> 01:28:54,394
But there is nothing that can help me

758
01:28:56,445 --> 01:29:01,644
the signs never lie

759
01:29:02,565 --> 01:29:10,597
If in the book above
it says you're blessed

760
01:29:10,685 --> 01:29:16,476
then throw them without fear

761
01:29:16,605 --> 01:29:22,601
The signs will always
spell out happiness

762
01:29:25,605 --> 01:29:30,963
that’s what Fate says

763
01:29:32,565 --> 01:29:39,596
If it’s time for you to die

764
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:44,721
then take your final breath

765
01:29:45,605 --> 01:29:53,285
Then throw them twenty times

766
01:29:53,525 --> 01:29:58,724
Amathambo won’t change their meaning

767
01:29:59,445 --> 01:30:03,484
If you have to die

768
01:30:03,605 --> 01:30:10,158
throw them twenty times

769
01:30:10,605 --> 01:30:18,603
Their meaning won’t change

770
01:30:19,965 --> 01:30:26,120
They'll still predict your death

771
01:30:31,725 --> 01:30:34,523
It’s death

772
01:30:38,045 --> 01:30:42,561
My death

773
01:30:42,605 --> 01:30:48,362
It’s always

774
01:30:50,485 --> 01:30:52,953
Death

775
01:31:14,245 --> 01:31:15,724
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

776
01:31:16,005 --> 01:31:17,597
Curiosity killed the cat

777
01:31:18,605 --> 01:31:20,960
We're not in the mood for silly games.

778
01:31:21,045 --> 01:31:24,481
That was not funny.

779
01:31:24,645 --> 01:31:26,636
They're coming back, let’s go.

780
01:31:35,365 --> 01:31:36,400
What’s gong on?

781
01:31:36,485 --> 01:31:38,605
There are three of them waiting down there.

782
01:31:38,605 --> 01:31:40,163
Only three?

783
01:31:40,245 --> 01:31:42,520
That’s fine. Half for each of us

784
01:31:43,085 --> 01:31:44,120
Piss off

785
01:31:45,525 --> 01:31:47,605
No one asked you.

786
01:31:47,605 --> 01:31:49,596
Keep watch and wait for the call.

787
01:31:50,485 --> 01:31:52,077
if anyone comes past,

788
01:31:53,085 --> 01:31:54,643
deal with them. Understand?

789
01:31:58,085 --> 01:32:00,599
Okay, girls, let’s see you work your stuff.

790
01:32:08,325 --> 01:32:12,159
We know just how to deal with them

791
01:32:12,245 --> 01:32:16,033
like all other men they'll be really dim

792
01:32:16,445 --> 01:32:18,595
What they desire

793
01:32:19,285 --> 01:32:23,403
is to pinch us on the arse

794
01:32:23,485 --> 01:32:25,476
No need to fight, no need to fuss

795
01:32:25,565 --> 01:32:27,521
when we can lead them by the nose

796
01:32:27,605 --> 01:32:31,605
Everyone enjoys some flattery

797
01:32:31,605 --> 01:32:33,605
Everything comes from being nice

798
01:32:33,605 --> 01:32:35,605
a smile is cheap at the price

799
01:32:35,605 --> 01:32:37,277
If we flatter them

800
01:32:37,365 --> 01:32:40,198
they'll let us pass

801
01:32:40,285 --> 01:32:42,162
Watch and you'll see

802
01:32:42,245 --> 01:32:44,440
we guarantee they'll let us pass

803
01:32:44,525 --> 01:32:46,561
All of the goods will get through!

804
01:32:51,445 --> 01:32:54,605
We know how to deal with them

805
01:32:54,605 --> 01:32:59,599
Like all other men they'll be dim

806
01:33:11,165 --> 01:33:14,077
They'll let us pass!

807
01:33:14,605 --> 01:33:18,962
Flattery will see us through!

808
01:33:51,165 --> 01:33:52,962
They've arrived,

809
01:33:53,165 --> 01:33:55,042
you can bring the bakkies.

810
01:33:56,245 --> 01:33:57,439
Let’s go.

811
01:34:15,605 --> 01:34:16,640
That’s the place.

812
01:34:17,605 --> 01:34:19,084
-There?
-Yes.

813
01:34:24,605 --> 01:34:26,596
I have my reasons for helping.

814
01:34:30,045 --> 01:34:32,081
Are you sure you're gong to be okay?

815
01:34:32,445 --> 01:34:34,163
Yes. Thank you.

816
01:34:48,085 --> 01:34:54,035
Poor girl, I lied

817
01:34:54,125 --> 01:34:57,401
to make her believe

818
01:34:57,485 --> 01:35:01,034
that I'm not frightened here

819
01:35:03,365 --> 01:35:06,641
I lied

820
01:35:09,605 --> 01:35:13,484
For within my poor heart

821
01:35:13,565 --> 01:35:17,558
I'm trembling with fear

822
01:35:19,645 --> 01:35:25,163
Scared, all alone in this place

823
01:35:25,245 --> 01:35:28,203
yet, in spite of my fear

824
01:35:28,285 --> 01:35:34,121
my heart is reassured

825
01:35:35,085 --> 01:35:39,442
For through the divine gift

826
01:35:39,525 --> 01:35:42,597
of Your Grace

827
01:35:43,285 --> 01:35:50,282
you will watch over me

828
01:35:50,605 --> 01:35:53,324
my Lord

829
01:37:54,205 --> 01:37:55,399
Leave me alone.

830
01:37:55,485 --> 01:37:56,605
Don’t you love me anymore?

831
01:37:56,605 --> 01:37:58,516
You're history.

832
01:38:01,605 --> 01:38:03,402
Leave her alone

833
01:38:12,285 --> 01:38:15,197
What are you doing here?

834
01:38:16,725 --> 01:38:22,595
Please listen to me

835
01:38:25,965 --> 01:38:29,321
Your mother

836
01:38:29,405 --> 01:38:35,196
her life nearly over

837
01:38:35,285 --> 01:38:39,119
is waiting to discover

838
01:38:39,205 --> 01:38:44,723
what’s happened to her son

839
01:38:45,005 --> 01:38:50,125
She won’t live much longer

840
01:38:50,205 --> 01:38:55,438
she longs to see you

841
01:38:56,365 --> 01:39:01,155
Please, have mercy on her

842
01:39:07,725 --> 01:39:11,001
Leave this place and come with me

843
01:39:11,085 --> 01:39:13,315
If your mother is ill

844
01:39:13,405 --> 01:39:15,475
you should go home

845
01:39:15,565 --> 01:39:18,033
Do you want me to go?

846
01:39:18,125 --> 01:39:20,605
There’s nothing for you here

847
01:39:20,605 --> 01:39:23,483
Do you want me to go

848
01:39:23,685 --> 01:39:28,600
so you can find a new lover?

849
01:39:30,005 --> 01:39:32,473
Never

850
01:39:32,565 --> 01:39:34,605
Hell, no!

851
01:39:34,605 --> 01:39:38,234
You must kill me first

852
01:39:40,005 --> 01:39:43,315
I'll stay till my last breath

853
01:39:43,405 --> 01:39:47,603
We took a vow

854
01:39:48,605 --> 01:39:53,963
that only death would separate us

855
01:39:54,045 --> 01:39:58,596
Though I find that death is near

856
01:39:59,725 --> 01:40:02,717
I'll never let you go

857
01:40:10,245 --> 01:40:11,314
Leave me be

858
01:40:12,125 --> 01:40:14,002
I am destined to die

859
01:40:18,605 --> 01:40:20,605
You'll be mine

860
01:40:20,605 --> 01:40:23,677
you bitch

861
01:40:24,005 --> 01:40:28,605
You were mine since you cast
your evil spell

862
01:40:28,605 --> 01:40:33,725
Our lives are so entwined

863
01:40:34,965 --> 01:40:39,605
only death will separate us

864
01:40:39,605 --> 01:40:44,395
Now my death awaits me

865
01:40:45,645 --> 01:40:48,478
I'll never let you go!

866
01:40:52,365 --> 01:40:55,516
Listen to me, Jongi

867
01:40:55,605 --> 01:41:00,156
for one last time

868
01:41:04,045 --> 01:41:09,438
Your mother is very ill

869
01:41:11,365 --> 01:41:15,722
and believe me

870
01:41:16,005 --> 01:41:18,473
she does not want to die

871
01:41:18,565 --> 01:41:21,443
until she’s forgiven you

872
01:41:21,525 --> 01:41:23,243
My mother about to die?

873
01:41:23,325 --> 01:41:24,963
Yes, it’s true!

874
01:41:25,245 --> 01:41:29,318
Then I must go

875
01:41:31,005 --> 01:41:33,599
You're in luck, for now

876
01:41:34,205 --> 01:41:37,595
But I will return

877
01:44:08,965 --> 01:44:14,597
house of KwaJola,
Mpondomse, MphaNkomo.

878
01:44:16,085 --> 01:44:17,598
Today we are here

879
01:44:18,605 --> 01:44:21,119
for my cousin Luiamie.

880
01:44:42,605 --> 01:44:44,516
Thank you, cousin.

881
01:44:47,205 --> 01:44:51,596
As you have heard from my cousin here,

882
01:44:55,525 --> 01:44:58,562
my father has been in my dreams,

883
01:44:59,405 --> 01:45:01,043
again and again.

884
01:45:02,405 --> 01:45:06,444
Therefore I made the decision to come home

885
01:45:06,525 --> 01:45:08,605
and perform this ceremony.

886
01:45:08,605 --> 01:45:11,073
He’s wise, that one.

887
01:45:13,005 --> 01:45:16,998
Jola, Ngwanya, Qengeba, MphaNkomo.

888
01:45:17,685 --> 01:45:21,564
Take this bull’s hide to keep you warm.

889
01:45:23,565 --> 01:45:28,719
Please continue protecting this family.

890
01:45:29,245 --> 01:45:30,724
You protected me while I was overseas

891
01:45:31,485 --> 01:45:33,605
and granted me good fortune.

892
01:45:33,605 --> 01:45:35,675
By these words I ask you

893
01:45:35,965 --> 01:45:39,162
to grant me continuing luck.

894
01:45:46,085 --> 01:45:48,679
I give you this spear to make the sacrifice.

895
01:45:49,605 --> 01:45:51,277
Thank you, cousin.

896
01:46:31,605 --> 01:46:34,403
Good afternoon, Mampondomse.

897
01:46:38,605 --> 01:46:42,484
Luiamie, we salute you

898
01:46:44,165 --> 01:46:49,364
As the family of kwaNgxabane, Qengeba,

899
01:46:49,445 --> 01:46:53,233
I say to all of you here,

900
01:46:55,285 --> 01:46:58,595
today we are as one family.

901
01:47:08,645 --> 01:47:10,601
We say to you,

902
01:47:11,605 --> 01:47:16,599
all your ancestors are here with you today.

903
01:47:18,085 --> 01:47:22,237
They've heard you.

904
01:49:16,965 --> 01:49:19,479
Take my advice

905
01:49:20,565 --> 01:49:22,999
you mustn’t stay around here

906
01:49:23,085 --> 01:49:25,599
Why not?

907
01:49:26,605 --> 01:49:28,277
He’s here

908
01:49:28,365 --> 01:49:29,593
Who?

909
01:49:29,645 --> 01:49:31,601
Him

910
01:49:34,445 --> 01:49:37,676
Hiding there in the audience

911
01:49:37,965 --> 01:49:39,603
Beware

912
01:49:42,245 --> 01:49:44,600
Yes, I can see him

913
01:49:45,365 --> 01:49:47,242
Beware

914
01:49:48,405 --> 01:49:53,115
I'm not the type to be frightened

915
01:49:55,085 --> 01:49:56,605
I will wait

916
01:49:56,605 --> 01:49:58,675
and speak to him

917
01:50:06,005 --> 01:50:09,042
Believe me

918
01:50:09,125 --> 01:50:10,604
beware

919
01:50:10,725 --> 01:50:12,602
I'm not scared

920
01:50:14,405 --> 01:50:15,963
Beware

921
01:51:14,445 --> 01:51:16,436
-It’s you
-It’s me

922
01:51:16,525 --> 01:51:19,437
They warned me

923
01:51:19,525 --> 01:51:23,279
that you were here

924
01:51:23,365 --> 01:51:26,357
and lying in wait for me

925
01:51:26,445 --> 01:51:29,198
They also told me

926
01:51:29,285 --> 01:51:34,234
that my life’s in danger

927
01:51:37,285 --> 01:51:39,958
But I'm not afraid

928
01:51:41,245 --> 01:51:44,601
and I won’t run away

929
01:51:45,645 --> 01:51:48,637
I'm not trying to scare you

930
01:51:53,525 --> 01:51:56,605
I'm begging you

931
01:51:56,605 --> 01:52:01,998
let’s put the past behind us

932
01:52:02,565 --> 01:52:05,637
Come back to me

933
01:52:05,725 --> 01:52:08,398
I forgive you

934
01:52:11,405 --> 01:52:14,522
If you come with me

935
01:52:14,605 --> 01:52:21,124
we'll begin a life together

936
01:52:21,205 --> 01:52:26,723
and live happily

937
01:52:27,085 --> 01:52:29,645
We shall never be together

938
01:52:29,725 --> 01:52:32,717
once love’s broken, it won’t mend

939
01:52:33,005 --> 01:52:37,556
I've made up my mind

940
01:52:38,525 --> 01:52:41,517
Our love is gone

941
01:52:41,605 --> 01:52:44,165
it’s over now

942
01:52:47,005 --> 01:52:52,125
You know it’s the truth

943
01:52:52,205 --> 01:52:55,163
when I say

944
01:52:55,245 --> 01:52:57,600
it is finished

945
01:53:01,525 --> 01:53:05,154
It can’t be the end

946
01:53:05,245 --> 01:53:09,602
Please say it isn’t over

947
01:53:12,165 --> 01:53:14,605
I'm still in love with you

948
01:53:14,605 --> 01:53:17,605
Give me a chance

949
01:53:17,605 --> 01:53:22,998
A chance to save you

950
01:53:23,085 --> 01:53:28,523
and save myself as well

951
01:53:36,525 --> 01:53:42,998
So you love me no more?

952
01:53:53,605 --> 01:53:59,601
So you love me no more?

953
01:54:00,605 --> 01:54:07,158
No, I love you no more

954
01:54:09,605 --> 01:54:13,598
I still adore you, Carmen

955
01:54:13,685 --> 01:54:17,605
My heart still burns with passion

956
01:54:17,605 --> 01:54:19,605
What do you want from me?

957
01:54:19,605 --> 01:54:21,960
You're being ridiculous

958
01:54:23,445 --> 01:54:26,357
I swear I'm still in love with you

959
01:54:27,605 --> 01:54:29,675
If it’s your desire

960
01:54:29,965 --> 01:54:31,603
I'll be a smuggler

961
01:54:31,685 --> 01:54:37,521
I'll do whatever you ask
Whatever you want

962
01:54:42,085 --> 01:54:46,605
Please don’t leave me

963
01:54:46,605 --> 01:54:49,597
Remember what we had

964
01:54:50,605 --> 01:54:54,598
Our love burned with passion!

965
01:54:55,605 --> 01:55:02,283
Please don’t leave me now!

966
01:55:02,365 --> 01:55:07,314
Carmen’s not scared of death

967
01:55:09,125 --> 01:55:11,958
Free I was born

968
01:55:12,045 --> 01:55:15,196
and free is how I'll die

969
01:55:31,685 --> 01:55:34,074
I'll ask you one more time

970
01:55:34,165 --> 01:55:35,605
you bitch

971
01:55:35,605 --> 01:55:37,605
to come with me

972
01:55:37,605 --> 01:55:40,199
No! No!

973
01:55:40,725 --> 01:55:44,434
Here’s your ring

974
01:55:44,605 --> 01:55:49,121
the stupid ring you gave me

975
01:55:49,325 --> 01:55:50,678
Take it!

976
01:55:52,485 --> 01:55:53,600
Down to hell!

977
01:56:29,285 --> 01:56:32,595
You can take me away

978
01:56:37,445 --> 01:56:41,154
I killed her
