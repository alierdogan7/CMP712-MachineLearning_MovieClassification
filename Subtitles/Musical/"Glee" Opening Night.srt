00:00:15,834 --> 00:00:18,269

8
00:00:18,303 --> 00:00:19,670
There's nothing on the hanger.

9
00:00:19,705 --> 00:00:21,806

the emperor wears no clothes.

12
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:33,250
Love me.
I love you.

13
00:00:33,285 --> 00:00:34,952
Why can't you love me back?

14
00:00:34,987 --> 00:00:36,754

00:00:36,788 --> 00:00:39,924

have no business being up there,

18
00:00:43,595 --> 00:00:44,862
Where's my purse?

19
00:00:44,896 --> 00:00:46,797
Or my Finn necklace.
Where's my Finn necklace?

20
00:00:46,832 --> 00:00:48,799

You killed it
in the previews up in Syracuse.

65
00:02:50,388 --> 00:02:52,756
- RACHEL: No, you didn't read any of the reviews.
- Yes, I did, I read every

66
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,325
- single one of them.
- No, you only read the legit ones.

67
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:55,626
You did not read the
independent bloggers

68
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,961
or you didn't read
the comments sections.

69
00:02:56,995 --> 00:02:58,596
I told you to stay out
of that comments section.

70
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,564
I know, but I couldn't help it,
and now it's like

71
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,566
they're my anxiety avatars.
Like the people in my dream.

72
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:04,001
They're the voices
of all the self-doubt

73
00:03:04,035 --> 00:03:05,736
that I've ever had
about myself. And, you know,

74
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,705
why do people become actors
in the first place?

75
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,673
You know? It's because
we want to be loved.

76
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,408
We're like a...
like a bottomless cup

77
00:03:11,443 --> 00:03:13,944
that just constantly needs to be
filled with love and validation.

78
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:15,946
Give me your phone.

79
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:22,129
You're being unplugged until
after your opening night.

80
00:03:22,154 --> 00:03:24,855

- No going on the Internet for anything.

All the greats do it.

82
00:03:26,224 --> 00:03:28,592
Scorsese, Woody, Miley.

83
00:03:28,627 --> 00:03:31,195
None of them read reviews
or blogs

84
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:32,830
or check Twitter. Okay?

85
00:03:32,864 --> 00:03:34,698
We are going to
hermetically seal this loft

86

it with positive affirmations

Hey, William.

94
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,191
How's your day going, huh?

95
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:01,665
Honestly, it's been
a little rough...

96
00:04:01,693 --> 00:04:02,827
Yeah, I don't care.

97
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:04,228
Listen, it's come
to my attention you have

98
00:04:04,262 --> 00:04:06,063
an extra plane ticket
to New York City.

99
00:04:06,097 --> 00:04:07,464
That's right, yeah.

100
00:04:07,499 --> 00:04:09,500
I'm going in for Rachel's
opening. (clears throat)

101
00:04:09,534 --> 00:04:11,802
Yeah, uh, Emma and I booked it
months ago, but she's obviously

102
00:04:11,837 --> 00:04:14,738
too pregnant to fly right now,
and Coach Beiste said that, uh,

103
00:04:14,773 --> 00:04:17,141
Southwest wouldn't let her fly
because she takes up two seats.

104
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:18,509
Well, I'll take the ticket.

105
00:04:18,543 --> 00:04:20,344
I have to see New York.

106
00:04:20,378 --> 00:04:21,779
What are you talking about?

107
00:04:21,813 --> 00:04:23,347
You hate New York.

108
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:27,451
Western Ohio, there's a scab
on the face of America.

109
00:04:27,486 --> 00:04:29,119
It's an island.

110
00:04:29,154 --> 00:04:31,789
It's shaped like a dong
and smells like hot pee.

111
00:04:31,823 --> 00:04:34,625
This island is called
New York City,

112
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:37,461
and it's high time
the real America

113
00:04:37,496 --> 00:04:40,498
told New York to take a hike.

114
00:04:40,532 --> 00:04:45,302
New York is a loud, overcrowded
cesspool of ten million people

115
00:04:45,337 --> 00:04:47,705
and 70 million rats,

116
00:04:47,739 --> 00:04:50,808
where the best one can expect
after a Central Park wilding

117
00:04:50,842 --> 00:04:53,244
at one of the city's hundreds
of ethnic day parades

118
00:04:53,278 --> 00:04:56,013
is a soggy, pork
anus frankfurter

119
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:57,648
that a cockroach walked across.

120
00:04:57,682 --> 00:05:00,651
New York is not just the playpen
of the mega-rich Honey?

121
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:02,620
Billionaires who
crushed and snorted

122
00:05:02,654 --> 00:05:04,321
our nation's
retirement savings...

123
00:05:04,356 --> 00:05:07,858
it's also the home of Broadway.

124
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:10,995
That great American institution
that bores us to death

125
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:13,764
one night a year with that
bi-curious minstrel show

126
00:05:13,798 --> 00:05:17,268
of self-congratulation:
the Tony Awards.

127
00:05:17,302 --> 00:05:21,505
That broadcast lit up the
switchboards with thousands

128
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,142
of angry callers, and the
network brass did their research

129
00:05:25,177 --> 00:05:28,179
and they discovered I've
never been to New York City.

130
00:05:28,213 --> 00:05:30,047
- What?
- You see, I've been taking my cue from

131
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:32,216
cable news lately,
just lying a lot.

132
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,517
But now I need to actually

133
00:05:33,552 --> 00:05:36,787
visit that hellhole
and see how soulless,

134
00:05:36,822 --> 00:05:39,056
empty and bullet-ridden
it really is.

135
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,724
- Well...
- Or I'll lose my credibility.

136
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:43,928
Okay. Fine, the ticket
is yours if you want it.

137
00:05:43,962 --> 00:05:46,163
But you have to
pay me back for it.

138
00:05:46,198 --> 00:05:47,865
And you have to come with me

139
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:49,233
to the opening night
of Rachel's show.

140
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:50,801
I mean it, Sue.

141
00:05:50,836 --> 00:05:52,469
No excuses.

142
00:05:52,504 --> 00:05:54,972
You drive a hard bargain,
Butt Chin.

143
00:05:55,006 --> 00:05:56,307
I'll do it.

144
00:05:56,341 --> 00:05:58,976
Great. Actually looking forward
to it. (short laugh)

145
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:05,216

This place smells like barf.

191
00:08:14,512 --> 00:08:16,992
Come on, Sue, follow me.

192
00:08:22,254 --> 00:08:23,734
- Tina.
- (laughs) Hi.

193
00:08:23,755 --> 00:08:26,390
- TINA: Hello, big fat Broadway star.
- Hey.

194
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:28,759
- Hi.
- About time.

195
00:08:28,793 --> 00:08:30,494
These are for you.

196
00:08:30,528 --> 00:08:32,162
(mouthing words)

197
00:08:32,197 --> 00:08:33,330
Oh, no. Do you
have laryngitis?

198
00:08:33,365 --> 00:08:35,232
Oh, no, she's just
resting her voice.

199
00:08:35,267 --> 00:08:37,268
Oh, thank God. This
would not be a good time

200
00:08:37,302 --> 00:08:39,603
for your tonsils to flare up again.
Remember that?

201
00:08:39,638 --> 00:08:41,438
First year of
Glee Club? (laughs)

202
00:08:41,473 --> 00:08:43,207
Hey, where is everyone?

203
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:47,077
Rachel's opening night
on Broadway is a big deal.

204
00:08:47,112 --> 00:08:49,380
And where's Artie?
I was hoping to get to see him.

205
00:08:49,414 --> 00:08:50,948
Oh, his short film
<i>Bags in the Wind</i>

206
00:08:50,982 --> 00:08:52,216
got accepted
into the Ft. Lauderdale

207
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,484
International
Short Film Festival.

208
00:08:53,518 --> 00:08:55,286
Oh, that's too
bad. I mean,

209
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,121
what about Quinn and
Puck and Santana?

210
00:08:57,155 --> 00:08:58,835
I mean, are they
just not being supportive?

211
00:08:58,857 --> 00:09:00,724
Tina! Why don't you catch us up?

212
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:02,593
How's Brown University
treating you? Mm.

213
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:04,595
Ah, I love everything about it.

214
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:07,431
Except for my dorm room.
My roommate...

215
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:09,867
she's nice... but she's from
Pakistan and she speaks

216
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:11,981
almost no English
and she's always watching

217
00:09:12,003 --> 00:09:13,504
that Al Jazeera channel.

218
00:09:13,538 --> 00:09:15,172
And, no, I don't
have a boyfriend,

219
00:09:15,206 --> 00:09:16,840
but I was dating
this really nice guy,

220
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,108
but he turned out to be...

221
00:09:18,143 --> 00:09:19,076
Gay. Gay. Gay.

222
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,679
- Proud homosexual.
- No.

223
00:09:21,713 --> 00:09:23,180
Yes.

224
00:09:23,214 --> 00:09:24,415
- Anyway...
- Knew it.

225
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:26,116
Rachel, I read this amazing

226
00:09:26,151 --> 00:09:28,018
story about you on
BroadwayWorld.com,

227
00:09:28,053 --> 00:09:30,120
and they are predicting
that<i> Funny Girl</i> is gonna be

228
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:31,655
a huge hit. And so
is everybody else,

229
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,490
- except for a few moronic bloggers.
- BLAINE: Oh, hey, Tina.

230
00:09:33,525 --> 00:09:36,193
- But, I mean, who are they to call you
pitchy? - Let's go get an iced mocha.

231
00:09:36,227 --> 00:09:38,429
And do not get me started on
those anonymous comment trolls.

232
00:09:38,463 --> 00:09:39,563
I mean, that...
You are not that short.

233
00:09:39,597 --> 00:09:41,277
ALL:
Shut up.

234
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:48,973
It's fine.
It's fine.

235
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:52,876
Frankly, the only opinions
that I care about are you guys.

236
00:09:52,911 --> 00:09:54,345
And I love you guys

237
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:55,579
and you love me.

238
00:09:55,614 --> 00:09:57,348
So, you know, if I ever

239
00:09:57,382 --> 00:09:59,617
need any validation, I just...

240
00:09:59,651 --> 00:10:02,620
turn to my buffet of people
right in front of me.

241
00:10:02,654 --> 00:10:06,156
If you don't mind,
I am going to take a nap.

242
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:11,028
This diva needs her
beauty rest. So...

243
00:10:12,797 --> 00:10:15,466
All right. Tina.
(mouthing)

244
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,167
Get your bags. You're
coming to my place.

245
00:10:17,202 --> 00:10:18,842
But I thought
I was staying here.

246
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,239
What if Rachel needs my love and
validation from the buffet? Just go.

247
00:10:25,543 --> 00:10:27,411
RACHEL:
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

248
00:10:27,445 --> 00:10:29,980
WOMAN: The only thing Berry's
got in common with Streisand

249
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,682
is her ginormous schnoz.
(chuckles)

250
00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:34,652
Someone call the bomb squad,
'cause<i> Funny Girl</i>

251
00:10:34,686 --> 00:10:36,387
will no doubt be a funless flop.

252
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:39,556
- Do Broadway a favor, Rachel Berry...
- No.

253
00:10:39,591 --> 00:10:42,359
- And take your bony, untalented butt back to...
- Nothing.

254
00:10:42,394 --> 00:10:44,394
Whatever Hobbit-hole
you crawled out of.

255
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:46,730
Oh, honey.

256
00:10:46,765 --> 00:10:48,532
Sorry.

257
00:10:56,131 --> 00:10:57,931
Guys. It's bad.

258
00:10:57,966 --> 00:11:00,567
Rachel has been
cybercutting all night.

259
00:11:00,602 --> 00:11:01,902
She read, like, every
negative comment ever written

260
00:11:01,936 --> 00:11:03,216
about her in the span
of an hour.

261
00:11:03,238 --> 00:11:05,039
- SAM (quietly): No!
- Yeah.

262
00:11:05,073 --> 00:11:06,707
Yeah, she's taken to her bed.

263
00:11:06,741 --> 00:11:08,976
She says she's too psyched
to go on tonight,

264
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,944
and her confidence is shot.

265
00:11:10,979 --> 00:11:12,513
We have to fill her with love

266
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:14,515
and validation so
she gets it back.

267
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:15,983
Otherwise, everything
she's ever worked for

268
00:11:16,017 --> 00:11:17,685
her entire life
is gonna be ruined.

269
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,054
Let's do it.

270
00:11:20,088 --> 00:11:21,388
Hey, uh, Rache?

271
00:11:21,423 --> 00:11:23,090
<i>Namaste,</i> Rachel.

272
00:11:23,124 --> 00:11:25,059
Hey, Rachel.

273
00:11:25,093 --> 00:11:28,028
(guitar strumming) BLAINE:
These magic hands right here,

274
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,930
they're gonna get you
back to your happy place.

275
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:31,298
RACHEL:
"Hello, gorgeous.

276
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,401
"Fanny Brice was
my most cherished role.

277
00:11:34,436 --> 00:11:37,438
"But I can't stay
in style forever.

278
00:11:37,472 --> 00:11:39,974
Now it's your turn. Barbara."

279
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:43,410
(guitar continues strumming)

280
00:11:43,445 --> 00:11:45,112
You of all people should know

281
00:11:45,146 --> 00:11:47,381
that Barbra dropped the "A"
when she was 18 years old

282
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,576
as an act of rebellion.
Who wrote this?! Tina?!

283
00:11:50,385 --> 00:11:53,120
BLAINE:
Or not.

284
00:11:53,154 --> 00:11:55,189
Okay.

285
00:11:56,224 --> 00:11:58,492
I've never seen her like this.

286
00:11:58,526 --> 00:12:01,495
BLAINE: I know. She's usually
pushing people away to get onstage.

287
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:04,031
It's not fair that anyone
can send a hateful tweet

288
00:12:04,065 --> 00:12:05,699
to anyone
and have access to artists.

289
00:12:05,734 --> 00:12:07,768
You know, I-I don't think
that it's the criticism

290
00:12:07,802 --> 00:12:10,504
that got to her; I think it's,
like, the volume of it.

291
00:12:10,538 --> 00:12:12,940
- It's Twitter.
- I can't believe my note didn't work.

292
00:12:12,974 --> 00:12:15,009
BLAINE: I know.
It was so good.

293
00:12:15,043 --> 00:12:17,011
Hello, losers.

294
00:12:17,045 --> 00:12:20,047
Well, you live in the worst neighborhood
in Brooklyn, and there isn't even

295
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:21,415
a lock on your door.

296
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,050
You might want to
look into that.

297
00:12:23,084 --> 00:12:25,524
Unless, of course, you think
the rapist is gonna just move on

298
00:12:25,553 --> 00:12:27,421
to the next apartment filled
with nubile 19-year-olds

299
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,556
simply because your door
is so damn annoying to open.

300
00:12:29,591 --> 00:12:31,725
What are you doing here?

301
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,561
Oh, Asian Number One, that's
totally something you would say.

302
00:12:34,596 --> 00:12:36,196
I have come

303
00:12:36,231 --> 00:12:38,532
to watch Rachel Berry choke
on her opening night.

304
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:39,800
RACHEL: I heard that!
I'm right in here!

305
00:12:39,834 --> 00:12:41,835
Sue, please,
Rachel is freaking out!

306
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,270
Well, she should be;
she's going to choke.

307
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:44,972
RACHEL:
I can hear you in here!

308
00:12:45,006 --> 00:12:46,286
Oh, and to answer your question,

309
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:47,675
Cheech and Chang,
I'm staying here overnight,

310
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:49,843
because I realized when
we arrived at the hotel

311
00:12:49,878 --> 00:12:51,679
that Will Schuester
is a big old perv

312
00:12:51,713 --> 00:12:54,181
and has been trying to sleep
with me this whole time.

313
00:12:55,684 --> 00:12:58,385
I-I thought I asked them
to change it to two twin beds.

314
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,787
- Adultery.
- No.

315
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,622
That's what this is called.

316
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:02,923
Well, you are<i> not</i> staying here.

317
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,458
I can't have you
anywhere near Rachel.

318
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,972
No, that's fine.
I'll stay in your room.

319
00:13:09,397 --> 00:13:12,700
SUE: Oh, thank God there's no
weird sex toys laying around.

320
00:13:12,734 --> 00:13:16,070
Things could not
possibly get any worse.

321
00:13:17,072 --> 00:13:19,073

(yells)

323
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:30,527
Look, what I'm
trying to say is,

324
00:13:30,552 --> 00:13:31,919
whenever I'm nervous
about choking

325
00:13:31,953 --> 00:13:34,922
in front of hundreds of people,
I eat a spoonful of mustard

326
00:13:34,956 --> 00:13:36,357
to make myself puke,

327
00:13:36,391 --> 00:13:38,659
and I get that part over with.

328
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,227
All right, where is she?
Kurt called me

329
00:13:40,262 --> 00:13:41,829
in the cab,
told me what was up.

330
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,163
She's been in there for hours.

331
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:44,531
We don't know how she's peeing.

332
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:45,933
Okay. Give me four minutes.

333
00:13:46,735 --> 00:13:48,702
I will return with Grey Poupon.

334
00:13:48,737 --> 00:13:50,604
(quietly):
What?

335
00:13:53,241 --> 00:13:55,276
You're the best they could do?

336
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,344
Hells, yes.

337
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,346
Because I am the closer.

338
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,715
And in two minutes, you are
gonna be out of this bed

339
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,284
ready to fistfight
the Taliban and offering

340
00:14:03,318 --> 00:14:05,786
- to buy me a diamond necklace.
- No pep talks

341
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,455
or anything are gonna work
right now. Honestly.

342
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,425
Okay? I've never felt like this
before in my entire life.

343
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:13,260
I never thought
in a hundred years

344
00:14:13,295 --> 00:14:15,129
that I'd be too afraid
to perform,

345
00:14:15,163 --> 00:14:17,765
but it's, like, these people
and all this stuff

346
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,633
is just, like, in my head.

347
00:14:19,668 --> 00:14:21,835
- And now I don't even know what's real anymore.
- Okay, okay.

348
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,971
- It's, like, I am all of my insecurity.

00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:33,753
- in the air.
- Oh, okay. I see. I didn't... I didn't know.

526
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:34,854
Don't feel bad.

527
00:22:34,888 --> 00:22:36,822
You know, that was
my first Broadway show.

528
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:39,592
Yeah. One of my patrons
gave me the tickets.

529
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:41,986
I didn't think it was gonna
make me want to barf so much.

530
00:22:42,132 --> 00:22:44,172
I mean, it's called<i> Funny Girl.</i>
I thought

531
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:45,558
it was gonna be
about a funny girl.

532
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:47,466
- Right?
- Yeah.(chuckles)

533
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:50,569
- It definitely was not funny,
and for a second there...
- No.

534
00:22:50,604 --> 00:22:52,705
I wasn't even sure
she was a girl.

535
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:55,107
You said "patron."
Are you a sex worker?

536
00:22:55,142 --> 00:22:58,377
(chuckles)
No. I am a restaurateur.

537
00:22:58,412 --> 00:23:01,547
Oh. I own a few places
around the city.

538
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:03,115
Yeah. I'm kind of a big deal.

539
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,483
Wow.

540
00:23:04,518 --> 00:23:05,885
You want to grab a bite?

541
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,322
Yeah.

542
00:23:09,356 --> 00:23:10,723
Hey!

543
00:23:10,757 --> 00:23:12,858
You're doing great
up there. You're giving it

544
00:23:12,893 --> 00:23:14,694
- the full Fanny.
- Hey, how you feeling?

545
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:16,729
I don't know. I don't know,
I don't know, I don't know.

546
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:19,083
I mean, good, good. But do
you guys think that, you know,

547
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:21,200
Sue getting up in the middle
had any sort of effect

548
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:23,369
on the critics or the audience
or anything like that?

549
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:25,037
- No.
- No, no, probably not.

550
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:27,206
No, right?

551
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:32,678
Bravo.

552
00:23:32,713 --> 00:23:34,413
- You were terrific in the first act.
- Oh, good, good, good.

553
00:23:34,448 --> 00:23:35,815
- Terrific.
- I made some little changes, but...

554
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:38,417
- No, no. It was wonderful. I promise you...
- Great.

555
00:23:38,452 --> 00:23:39,919
- It was wonderful.
- Okay.

556
00:23:39,953 --> 00:23:42,655
I'm a little concerned
about that guy in the...

557
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:45,157
the tracksuit leaving
right at the beginning.

558
00:23:45,192 --> 00:23:47,493
I mean, he stepped
over the critic of the<i> Times.</i>

559
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:48,527
The guy was spooked.

560
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:50,029
- Oh, my God.
- No, no, no, no, no.

561
00:23:50,063 --> 00:23:52,932
Not to worry, not to worry.

562
00:23:52,966 --> 00:23:55,601
The important thing now

563
00:23:55,636 --> 00:23:57,970
is what you do in act two.

564
00:23:58,005 --> 00:24:01,274
Critics remember
beginnings and endings.

565
00:24:01,308 --> 00:24:02,575
So now you have to dig deep.

566
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,277
I know you can do it.

567
00:24:04,311 --> 00:24:06,212
All you have to do is share it
with everybody.

568
00:24:06,246 --> 00:24:07,847
I can do it.

569
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:10,116
Sorry to tell you,
you're gonna have to.

570
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,784
With all the work
that we've done,

571
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:13,052
all the money that's been

572
00:24:13,086 --> 00:24:14,453
put in,

573
00:24:14,488 --> 00:24:16,255
it's all for that one critic
from the<i> Times.</i>

574
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,791
If he doesn't like it...

575
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:20,192
we're kaput.

576
00:24:20,227 --> 00:24:24,030
If the review is bad, then
opening night is closing night.

577
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,232
And that...

578
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:28,267
is showbiz.

579
00:24:39,256 --> 00:24:41,873
I mean, seriously,
if I wanted to see a show

580
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:43,299
about an ugly duckling
who gets dumped,

581
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:44,800
I'd just watch an episode
of<i> Girls.</i>

582
00:24:44,835 --> 00:24:46,269
I hear you.

583
00:24:46,303 --> 00:24:48,037
So welcome to Mario's,
Sue Sylvester,

584
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:50,039
the gem of Little Italy.

585
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:52,375
I know it's changed from
when I was growing up.

586
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:54,744
Now it's pretty much one street
surrounded by Chinatown.

587
00:24:54,778 --> 00:24:56,279
But, still, it's pretty special.

588
00:24:56,313 --> 00:24:58,281
Well, I do like the idea
of naming a restaurant

589
00:24:58,315 --> 00:25:00,483
after one's self.
(chuckles)

590
00:25:00,517 --> 00:25:03,286
Hey, Salvatore.
This is Sue Sylvester.

591
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,620
I'm gonna go whip
up something...

592
00:25:04,655 --> 00:25:06,289
<i>Buonasera,</i> Signorina Sylvester.

593
00:25:06,323 --> 00:25:09,625
This is America.
We speak English here.

594
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,761
So,

595
00:25:11,795 --> 00:25:13,562
what can I make for you?

596
00:25:13,597 --> 00:25:16,832
How about some gnocchi
alla napolitano?

597
00:25:16,867 --> 00:25:19,201
Or, uh, linguine al pesto?

598
00:25:19,236 --> 00:25:21,470
I'm not sure.

599
00:25:21,505 --> 00:25:24,373
And, to tell you the truth, no
one's ever cooked for me before.

600
00:25:24,408 --> 00:25:26,309
What? You got to be kidding.

601
00:25:26,343 --> 00:25:29,011
No. It's true. My parents
were famous Nazi hunters,

602
00:25:29,046 --> 00:25:30,479
so they weren't around a lot.

603
00:25:30,514 --> 00:25:33,382
Also, I've been threatened
with poisonings several times,

604
00:25:33,417 --> 00:25:35,251
so I don't even order takeout
without my food taster,

605
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:36,686
and Becky's back in Ohio.

606
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,289
(sizzling)
All right, I got to ask.

607
00:25:40,324 --> 00:25:42,692
Married?

608
00:25:43,727 --> 00:25:45,361
I'm divorced, actually.

609
00:25:45,395 --> 00:25:47,163
Um, I was briefly married
to myself,

610
00:25:47,197 --> 00:25:48,631
uh, but it didn't work out.

611
00:25:48,665 --> 00:25:51,834
We both realized in the
end that we'd grown apart.

612
00:25:51,868 --> 00:25:53,703
Huh.

613
00:25:55,205 --> 00:25:57,006
You?

614
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:00,810
No, I'm, uh, married to my city.

615
00:26:00,844 --> 00:26:03,012
This town is my mistress.

616
00:26:03,046 --> 00:26:04,981
She's my type of gal.

617
00:26:06,016 --> 00:26:07,650
Cruel, delicious

618
00:26:07,684 --> 00:26:09,852
and 100 stories tall.

619
00:26:14,024 --> 00:26:15,992
- There you go.
- Oh.

620
00:26:16,026 --> 00:26:18,661
- <i>Buon appetito.</i>
- Mmm.

621
00:26:18,695 --> 00:26:20,062
(inhales deeply)

622
00:26:20,097 --> 00:26:21,197
(sighs)

623
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:22,865
I have to say,

624
00:26:22,899 --> 00:26:25,067
when I decided
to come to New York,

625
00:26:25,102 --> 00:26:28,004
I did not think this
was going to happen.

626
00:26:28,038 --> 00:26:29,338
(both chuckle)

627
00:26:29,373 --> 00:26:30,940
(speaks Italian) Oh.

628
00:26:30,974 --> 00:26:33,943
Oh. I knew that<i> Funny Girl</i>
would be a disaster.

629
00:26:33,977 --> 00:26:36,812
I've seen Rachel Berry butcher
literally dozens of show tunes

630
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:39,348
with many an ugly cry, but...

631
00:26:39,383 --> 00:26:44,086
I did not predict that I would
meet somebody like you.

632
00:26:44,121 --> 00:26:45,354
Me, neither.

633
00:26:45,389 --> 00:26:47,957
Although there aren't
a lot of women like you.

634
00:26:49,226 --> 00:26:52,194
You know, that show
would've been a lot better

635
00:26:52,229 --> 00:26:54,149
if you'd been up there
on that stage.

636
00:26:54,998 --> 00:26:56,799
(glasses clink)

637
00:26:58,935 --> 00:27:00,936

Oh, my God. Oh,

667
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,705
- I am gonna have a big glass of that.
- Yay.

668
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,374
- Oh, my God, Rachel. You were so great.
- Thank you.

669
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:47,476
I bawled during "Who Are You Now?".

670
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:49,445
I had to blow my nose on Sam's sleeve.

671
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:50,446
This is suede.

672
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,514
I'm sorry. You guys,

673
00:29:51,548 --> 00:29:52,869
I love you so much.
I seriously...

674
00:29:52,883 --> 00:29:54,383
I couldn't have done this
without all of you.

675
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:56,138
KURT: And you got flowers
from Quinn I know.

676
00:29:56,153 --> 00:29:58,721
And Artie and Mike Chang
and Puck and Principal Figgins.

677
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,590
Clearly you're loved by many.

678
00:30:00,624 --> 00:30:02,325
(laughing)

679
00:30:03,493 --> 00:30:05,094
Whoa...
(whooping)

680
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:06,329
Tonight,

681
00:30:06,363 --> 00:30:08,197
you are a star.

682
00:30:08,231 --> 00:30:10,733
(cheering)
Oh, my God. Thank you so much.

683
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,002
You know what, you guys,
let's save all the praises

684
00:30:13,036 --> 00:30:15,071
- until after the<i> New York Times
</i> review comes out. - Yeah, yeah.

685
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:16,472
- You're right, you're right.
- Yeah.

686
00:30:16,506 --> 00:30:18,140
We have, uh, six hours
of innocence left.

687
00:30:18,175 --> 00:30:21,310
- Whew. - And then when the reviews
hit the stand, we'll find out

688
00:30:21,345 --> 00:30:25,114
if we're the best thing
since sliced bread or toast.

689
00:30:25,148 --> 00:30:26,115
But...

690
00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:27,583
we are going

691
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:29,151
- to celebrate tonight.
- Okay.

692
00:30:29,186 --> 00:30:32,021
We are going to have
an opening night party,

693
00:30:32,055 --> 00:30:34,490
Elio's restaurant,
Italian restaurant.

694
00:30:34,524 --> 00:30:36,726
Eggplant parmigiana

695
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,595
always, always
brings me good luck.

696
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,998
- Yeah! Yay.
- Rachel, Rachel,

697
00:30:42,032 --> 00:30:44,533
- your friends, huh?
- Yeah.

698
00:30:44,568 --> 00:30:46,602
- Bring everybody!
- (cheering)

699
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:48,271
All right, bye.

700
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:49,472
Whoa. Eggplant parmigiana?
Thank you.

701
00:30:49,506 --> 00:30:51,874
I can't believe it,
a real Broadway cast party.

702
00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:54,710
I don't really feel
like going to the party.

703
00:30:54,745 --> 00:30:56,279
I think that they're just gonna

704
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:57,613
only be talking about the play,

705
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:59,115
and... I don't know...
I'd rather just...

706
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,449
celebrate with you guys.

707
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:01,550
BLAINE:
I know just the place

708
00:31:01,585 --> 00:31:02,551
down in Greenwich Village.

709
00:31:02,586 --> 00:31:03,452
Trust me, Rachel,

710
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:04,887
they're gonna love you there.

711
00:31:04,922 --> 00:31:07,023
(booming dance music playing)

712
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,298
(laughing):
Oh, my God.

713
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:16,632
Oh, my God.

714
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:18,935
Rachel Berry?!
Here?!

715
00:31:18,969 --> 00:31:21,270
Oh, my God, you recognize me?

716
00:31:21,305 --> 00:31:24,207
(music stops) We've been
tracking <i> Funny Girl</i> for weeks.

717
00:31:24,241 --> 00:31:25,074
How was tonight?

718
00:31:25,108 --> 00:31:26,209
She was incredible.

719
00:31:26,243 --> 00:31:27,610
Oh, well, then
this is historic.

720
00:31:27,644 --> 00:31:30,046
You have to sing something...
it's Broadway tradition.

721
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,248
- Oh, no. I'm... I'm not sure.
- Whatever the review

722
00:31:32,282 --> 00:31:34,717
says tomorrow, let's just love
and celebrate you tonight,

723
00:31:34,751 --> 00:31:35,952
right now.

724
00:31:35,986 --> 00:31:38,087
Well, in that case...

725
00:31:38,121 --> 00:31:40,041
- I'm here for the night!
- (cheering)

726
00:31:40,057 --> 00:31:41,157
Hit it!

00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:02,265
I haven't danced that hard
since Nationals two years ago.

769
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:04,100
I got the DJ's number.

770
00:34:04,134 --> 00:34:06,302
Oh. Tina, I told you,
he's totally gay.

771
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:07,537
- Come on.
- Gay?

772
00:34:07,571 --> 00:34:09,472
- TINA: No!
- BLAINE: What are you, blind? Tina!

773
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:10,907
Uh, I'm gonna make

774
00:34:10,941 --> 00:34:13,376
some coffee, you guys. The
reviews come out in 30 minutes,

775
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:16,045
and I want us all to go down
to the newsstand together.

776
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,781
Uh, I'll take mine black,
thanks.

777
00:34:18,815 --> 00:34:20,383
(sighs)

778
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:24,320
Who are all you people?

779
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:26,222
Oh, my God.

780
00:34:26,256 --> 00:34:27,523
You are the guy... the guy

781
00:34:27,558 --> 00:34:29,225
that walked out
of my show last night.

782
00:34:29,259 --> 00:34:30,620
What are you doing
in my apartment?

783
00:34:30,627 --> 00:34:31,661
In my robe?

784
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:32,862
Well, aren't you all

785
00:34:32,896 --> 00:34:35,031
so very, very rude.

786
00:34:35,065 --> 00:34:38,301
Oh, my God,
Sue had sex in your bed.

787
00:34:39,236 --> 00:34:40,636
(sniffles)

788
00:34:40,671 --> 00:34:42,939
Actually, we did it
all over your apartment.

789
00:34:42,973 --> 00:34:45,842
And if I were you, I'd put
something down on that couch

790
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:46,809
before I sat on it.

791
00:34:46,844 --> 00:34:47,677
Oh, no, no.

792
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:48,811
No, no, no, no.

793
00:34:48,846 --> 00:34:50,112
So, how'd the rest

794
00:34:50,147 --> 00:34:51,514
of the show go, huh?

795
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:53,082
I considered coming back
for act two

796
00:34:53,116 --> 00:34:54,584
just so I could walk out again.

797
00:34:54,618 --> 00:34:56,686
Okay, you know what? I am not...

798
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,341
It's okay. I got this.

799
00:35:00,376 --> 00:35:04,345
You made my life in high school
a living hell.

800
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,513
Well, thank you.

801
00:35:05,548 --> 00:35:06,748
And it's like you had a mission

802
00:35:06,749 --> 00:35:08,450
to keep us underwater,

803
00:35:08,484 --> 00:35:10,785
never coming up,
even for a breath

804
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,621
of air, and you said
that it was to push us,

805
00:35:13,656 --> 00:35:15,857
but I really don't think
that's what you wanted,

806
00:35:15,891 --> 00:35:18,026
because if we actually felt

807
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,729
how wonderful and amazing
and loved we really were,

808
00:35:21,764 --> 00:35:23,965
then we would know
what you knew all along,

809
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:27,335
which is that you are
a rotten and awful person

810
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:29,704
who only finds joy
in people's misery.

811
00:35:29,738 --> 00:35:31,072
Well, let me
tell you something.

812
00:35:31,107 --> 00:35:32,474
Something amazing
happened tonight.

813
00:35:32,508 --> 00:35:34,109
A group of friends
rallied together

814
00:35:34,143 --> 00:35:35,577
and made a dream come true.

815
00:35:35,611 --> 00:35:39,047
And never, ever in your empty,
sad life will you feel

816
00:35:39,081 --> 00:35:41,182
the kind of love
that I felt tonight.

817
00:35:41,217 --> 00:35:42,283
And I would feel

818
00:35:42,318 --> 00:35:44,252
so sad for you, but I don't,

819
00:35:44,286 --> 00:35:46,921
because I just want you to get
the hell out of my apartment,

820
00:35:46,956 --> 00:35:48,876
because I want to be
with my friends.

821
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:53,228
Wow.

822
00:35:53,262 --> 00:35:55,630
Oh, Mario, I'm sorry
you had to see that.

823
00:35:55,664 --> 00:35:57,398
Let's go.

824
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:02,537
I suddenly don't feel
very welcome here anymore.

825
00:36:05,975 --> 00:36:07,942
(sighs)

826
00:36:07,977 --> 00:36:10,879
Well, it was, uh, super
meeting all of you.

827
00:36:11,847 --> 00:36:13,281
Hey, where'd you get this robe?

828
00:36:13,315 --> 00:36:16,518
- Just keep it.
- Thanks, bro.

829
00:36:19,853 --> 00:36:22,333
MERCEDES:
Ah, Rachel.

830
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:23,658
Bravo.

831
00:36:23,692 --> 00:36:26,361
BLAINE:
Rachel. Rachel!

832
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:27,996
- Rachel! Rachel!
- Yeah.

833
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,098
Poetry... couldn't

834
00:36:30,132 --> 00:36:33,733
have said it better myself.
(applause, whooping)

835
00:36:35,622 --> 00:36:38,223
(sirens blaring)

836
00:36:38,258 --> 00:36:40,326
Sir, do you have
the<i> New York Times?</i>

837
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,728
- It's the paper of record.
- How old are you?

838
00:36:42,762 --> 00:36:45,764
They're gonna e-mail you the<i> New</i>
<i>York Times</i> in three minutes.

839
00:36:45,799 --> 00:36:48,067
- What the heck?
- Just give us the paper.

840
00:36:48,101 --> 00:36:50,235
Oh, my God.

841
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,304
SANTANA:
Open it.

842
00:36:52,339 --> 00:36:53,739
Come on.

843
00:36:53,773 --> 00:36:55,074
Open it!

844
00:36:55,108 --> 00:36:56,375
Open... I'm cold!

845
00:36:56,409 --> 00:36:57,543
Can you open it?

846
00:36:57,577 --> 00:36:58,911
Rachel, let's go,
let's read it.

847
00:36:58,945 --> 00:37:00,585
No, I can't, I can't.
I can't do it, Kurt.

848
00:37:00,613 --> 00:37:01,981
- You're gonna have to read it.
- No way!

849
00:37:02,015 --> 00:37:03,515
- I'm too nervous. - You know what?
Give me this.

850
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,584
I don't mind being
the bearer of bad news.

851
00:37:05,618 --> 00:37:08,120
- All right.
- SANTANA: Okay.

852
00:37:08,154 --> 00:37:09,521
"One might ask themselves, why?

853
00:37:09,556 --> 00:37:10,789

00:37:47,494 --> 00:37:48,994
"to criticize the bold mistakes

875
00:37:49,029 --> 00:37:50,763
of a supernova exploding
before our eyes."

876
00:37:50,797 --> 00:37:54,967
MERCEDES: "I just pray to God that no
one saw me secretly wiping my tears

877
00:37:55,001 --> 00:37:57,102
- No!
- "during her show-stopping 'Who Are You Now?'

878
00:37:57,137 --> 00:37:59,738
"I don't know where inside
that small frame Berry went

879
00:37:59,773 --> 00:38:02,041
"to find the emotion
she delivered with that song,

880
00:38:02,075 --> 00:38:04,076
but she melted the icy heart
of this reviewer."

881
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,644
Oh, my God.
Let me see.

882
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:06,912
- Okay.
- All right.

883
00:38:06,946 --> 00:38:08,781
"I hope this show runs
for a long time, not because

884
00:38:08,815 --> 00:38:10,416
"anyone needs to see
'Don't Rain on My Parade' again,

885
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:11,610
"or the producers found a way

886
00:38:11,618 --> 00:38:12,918
"to get a real tugboat
onstage, but because

887
00:38:12,952 --> 00:38:14,086
"I want to have some time

888
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,654
"to enjoy Rachel
Berry as she is now.

889
00:38:15,689 --> 00:38:16,922
"I know I will be going back

890
00:38:16,957 --> 00:38:18,590
for a second heaping bowl
of Rachel Berry."

891
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:21,193
(cheering, overlapping chatter)

892
00:38:21,227 --> 00:38:22,361
(whooping) Yes! (phone ringing)

893
00:38:22,395 --> 00:38:23,696
My phone is ringing.

894
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:24,863
Who's call...?

895
00:38:24,898 --> 00:38:26,332
Oh, it's Mr. Shue!
Oh, hey.

896
00:38:26,366 --> 00:38:28,667
Oh, wait. Mr. Shue,
I'm putting you on speaker!

897
00:38:28,702 --> 00:38:32,338
I made it back just in time
for the last few pushes.

898
00:38:32,372 --> 00:38:35,474
Emma's doing fine,
and so is the baby.

899
00:38:35,508 --> 00:38:36,642
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Yay!

900
00:38:36,676 --> 00:38:38,410
Shut up and just tell us
what we need to know.

901
00:38:38,445 --> 00:38:39,578
Boy or girl?

902
00:38:39,613 --> 00:38:40,746
It's a boy.

903
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,214
(cheering
and overlapping chatter)

904
00:38:42,248 --> 00:38:43,716
It's a boy.

905
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,517
Yeah, we're naming him Daniel.

906
00:38:45,552 --> 00:38:47,119
Daniel Finn Schuester.

907
00:38:47,153 --> 00:38:48,320
Aw.

908
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:53,225
Hey, hey, how was...
how was the show?

909
00:38:53,259 --> 00:38:55,694
It was amazing.
How do you feel?

910
00:38:55,729 --> 00:38:57,896
(laughing)

911
00:38:57,931 --> 00:39:01,367
Oh, for the first time
in my life, I feel...

912
00:39:01,401 --> 00:39:03,369
completely happy.

913
00:39:05,071 --> 00:39:07,206
How about you?

914
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,208
Same. I feel the exact same.

915
00:39:09,242 --> 00:39:10,809
So, I got to run.

916
00:39:10,844 --> 00:39:11,977
Okay, well, we love you.

917
00:39:12,012 --> 00:39:13,212
(overlapping chatter) ALL: Bye.

918
00:39:13,246 --> 00:39:14,813
Bye. Love you,
Mr. Shue.

919
00:39:14,848 --> 00:39:16,815
(siren blaring)

920
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:19,585
So... what now?

921
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:21,587
Well, it's morning.

922
00:39:21,621 --> 00:39:23,822
I have an early
flight to catch.

923
00:39:25,925 --> 00:39:29,395
Hey, I, uh... I don't
suppose I could convince you

924
00:39:29,429 --> 00:39:32,264
to stay in New York
a little longer.

925
00:39:32,299 --> 00:39:34,300
Um...

926
00:39:34,334 --> 00:39:37,036
No. I have a school
to run and a daughter

927
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:39,505
that needs me, whose
father is Michael Bolton.

928
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:41,674
Wait. What?

929
00:39:41,708 --> 00:39:44,610
Last night was
truly magical. I...

930
00:39:44,644 --> 00:39:47,212
Oh, turns out I love New York,

931
00:39:47,247 --> 00:39:50,082
and you are the reason why.

932
00:39:50,116 --> 00:39:53,052
But, Mario,
I'm a Lima gal at heart.

933
00:39:53,086 --> 00:39:55,688
I, uh... I love
living in a place

934
00:39:55,722 --> 00:39:58,891
where "Hang On, Sloopy"
is the official state song.

935
00:39:58,925 --> 00:40:01,994
Where the Y Bridge in Zanesville
spans the confluence

936
00:40:02,028 --> 00:40:04,630
of the Muskingum and
Licking Rivers, making it

937
00:40:04,664 --> 00:40:06,699
the only bridge in the world
that you can cross

938
00:40:06,733 --> 00:40:08,901
and still be
on the same side of the river.

939
00:40:08,935 --> 00:40:10,536
I love living in a place

940
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,871
that is home
to the world's largest basket,

941
00:40:12,906 --> 00:40:16,208
located in Basket Village, USA.

942
00:40:16,243 --> 00:40:18,877
I guess what I'm saying, Mario,

943
00:40:18,912 --> 00:40:22,348
is, um, Sue Sylvester's
a big fish

944
00:40:22,382 --> 00:40:26,252
who really kind of likes
swimming in a little pond.

945
00:40:26,286 --> 00:40:28,487
I don't suppose

946
00:40:28,521 --> 00:40:31,690
I could convince<i> you</i>
to, uh, pull up stakes and...

947
00:40:31,725 --> 00:40:33,092
(sighs)

948
00:40:33,126 --> 00:40:36,895
Uh, you know, I'm
a New Yorker, Sue.

949
00:40:38,765 --> 00:40:42,234
So, uh, I guess that's it, huh?

950
00:40:42,269 --> 00:40:44,603
I guess so.

951
00:40:44,638 --> 00:40:48,908
It sure was nice getting
to know you, Sue Sylvester.

952
00:41:00,086 --> 00:41:02,087
(sighs)

953
00:41:04,424 --> 00:41:05,591
(whistles)

954
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:07,326
(sighs) Yeah.

955
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,562
So long, Sue.

956
00:41:10,597 --> 00:41:13,198
(sighing):
Ah.

957
00:41:13,233 --> 00:41:14,433
Where to, lady?

958
00:41:14,467 --> 00:41:17,069
Huh? I take.

959
00:41:17,103 --> 00:41:19,004
Ah, ah, ah.
I...

960
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:21,040
Cra... crazy!

961
00:41:22,812 --> 00:41:24,052
Drive the car.

962
00:41:24,077 --> 00:41:25,210
Crazy lady.

963
00:41:25,245 --> 00:41:27,246
I got it. I got it.

964
00:41:29,115 --> 00:41:31,116
(sighs)

965
00:41:33,853 --> 00:41:36,255
(sighs)

966
00:41:36,289 --> 00:41:38,991
Thanks for making
me feel like a girl.

967
00:41:40,594 --> 00:41:42,161
She wasn't right...

968
00:41:42,195 --> 00:41:44,296
the short girl from the play.

969
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:46,298
You are lovable, Sue.

970
00:41:51,338 --> 00:41:53,339
Let's get out of here.

971
00:41:59,512 --> 00:42:02,147
Recently, I've gotten
in a lot of hot water

972
00:42:02,182 --> 00:42:05,251
for some comments
I made on this broadcast.

973
00:42:05,285 --> 00:42:07,853
Last week, I called
New York City an overpriced,

974
00:42:07,888 --> 00:42:10,556
rat-infested hellhole that
smells like an adult diaper.

975
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:12,691
Well, let me be clear.

976
00:42:12,726 --> 00:42:14,994
I stand by my comments.

977
00:42:15,028 --> 00:42:18,697
Every word I said...
absolutely true.

978
00:42:18,732 --> 00:42:21,133
Except for one thing.

979
00:42:21,167 --> 00:42:23,669
I don't hate New York.

980
00:42:23,703 --> 00:42:26,872
I love... New York.

981
00:42:26,907 --> 00:42:30,442
There's nowhere on
earth quite like it.

982
00:42:30,477 --> 00:42:34,613
There's no place so alive with
endless worlds of possibility.

983
00:42:34,648 --> 00:42:36,081
Every time you step outside,

984
00:42:36,116 --> 00:42:37,816
you find yourself
on an adventure

985
00:42:37,851 --> 00:42:39,184
you never could have predicted.

986
00:42:39,219 --> 00:42:41,987
Sure, you might get hit by a bus
or stop for pierogies

987
00:42:42,022 --> 00:42:44,623
and end up being human
trafficked by the Russian Mob,

988
00:42:44,658 --> 00:42:49,128
but if you're anything like this
champion cheerleading coach,

989
00:42:49,162 --> 00:42:52,865
you just might also find love.

990
00:42:54,134 --> 00:42:56,235
Or, at the very least,

991
00:42:56,269 --> 00:42:59,038
a night of sturdy,
spirited lovemaking

992
00:42:59,072 --> 00:43:01,640
with a relative stranger
in every corner of the apartment

993
00:43:01,675 --> 00:43:03,209
of several
of your former students.

994
00:43:03,243 --> 00:43:04,610
(clicks her tongue)

995
00:43:04,644 --> 00:43:09,027
And that's how
Sue... sees it.
