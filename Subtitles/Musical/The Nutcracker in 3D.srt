- Nothing special.
- No big deal.

it's no wonder you see exploding pillows.

Hurry, back to bed, children.
Hurry.

632
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:39,878
So this tree was 200 feet tall and
reached all the way up to the stars?

633
00:47:40,057 --> 00:47:43,390
I told you. The ceiling was gone.

634
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:47,052
The ornaments danced, you flew,
and then the tree came crashing down?

635
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:51,394
It must have been wonderful.

636
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:53,968

Do you, Max?

637
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:56,128
Not a word.

00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:59,404

639
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:02,636
Make this room grow before our eyes.

640
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:05,646
I can't. I don't have the power.

641
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:08,979
Then maybe you'd like to explain
how this tree got sawed through?

642
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:11,586
Because they have steel teeth.

643
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:16,021
A bit of fun is one thing, Mary,
but quite blatantly lying is another.

644
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:19,252
Now...

645
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:24,491
give me that doll.

646
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:29,835
You can't have him.

647
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:31,474
Ever.

648
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:34,668
And I'm not lying. I never do.

649
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:42,451
Joseph, listen. Do you remember
what Doctor Freud told us

650
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:44,883
about child psychology and dreams?

651
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,545
Please, can I have one morning

652
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:49,487

being dragged into everything?

653
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:00,367
Where are you going?

654
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:06,674
I don't want you to see me cry.

655
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:15,875
Nobody's listening.

00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:18,851
