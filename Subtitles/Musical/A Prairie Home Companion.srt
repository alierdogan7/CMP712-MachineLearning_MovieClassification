1
00:00:56,518 --> 00:00:57,630
Market reports today...

2
00:00:57,702 --> 00:01:02,013
barrows and gilts at 220 to 260 pounds
are lower at $40.

3
00:01:02,086 --> 00:01:05,534
Sows are steady.
300 to 500 pounds, $34 to $37.

4
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:09,435
Goin' over to the feeder cattle,
beef steers, $120 to $150...

5
00:01:11,206 --> 00:01:12,155
The way I like to do it...

6
00:01:12,231 --> 00:01:15,164
is I take one can
of cream of mushroom soup...

7
00:01:15,238 --> 00:01:17,061
and then one package of egg noodles.

8
00:01:17,126 --> 00:01:20,061
I like the egg noodles
better than the Italian ones.

9
00:01:20,135 --> 00:01:21,214
I like to put...

10
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:27,333
<i>If we look at what the Lord said
in the book of Revelation...</i>

11
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:30,465
you can be sure
that there's a price to pay...

12
00:01:30,534 --> 00:01:34,942
for the way of the flesh
and that price will be paid if you don't...

13
00:01:35,014 --> 00:01:39,455
Here's the wind-up and the pitch.

14
00:01:39,527 --> 00:01:41,567
And it's two and two, two and two...

15
00:01:49,862 --> 00:01:51,718
Before you just say,
"Honey, I think we have to have...

16
00:01:51,782 --> 00:01:54,052
"some couple's counseling.
I mean, I think we have a problem.

17
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:55,068
"I can't leave a cup here for... "

18
00:02:04,648 --> 00:02:07,070
All right. It's time for traffic on the fives...

19
00:02:07,143 --> 00:02:08,637
and let's find out
what's going on with your drive.

20
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,435
Let's go to Chopper.
Chopper, what's happening?

21
00:02:10,504 --> 00:02:13,024
All right, Lettie.
We got a fifteen-minute, uh, wait-494.

22
00:02:13,095 --> 00:02:15,201
There's an accident working
at the spaghetti junction.

23
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:17,508
at 630, but it still
will make a very slow go...

24
00:02:37,383 --> 00:02:41,278
A quiet night in a city that knows
how to keep its secrets.

25
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:46,020
But one man is still looking for
the answers to life's persistent questions.

26
00:02:50,663 --> 00:02:52,256
That's me.

27
00:02:52,328 --> 00:02:54,302
Or it used to be.

28
00:02:54,376 --> 00:02:56,547
It was a rainy Saturday night in St. Paul...

29
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,201
and I had just finished off
a grilled cheese sandwich...

30
00:02:59,273 --> 00:03:00,581
with beans for a chaser...

31
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:03,200
and it was time to head
for work across the street.

32
00:03:14,056 --> 00:03:15,713
I'm a private eye.

33
00:03:15,783 --> 00:03:17,212
Noir's the name.

34
00:03:17,287 --> 00:03:18,750
Guy Noir.

35
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:22,686
But I'd taken temporary employment
about six years before...

36
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,746
<i>doing security for a radio show
called A Prairie Home Companion...</i>

37
00:03:27,816 --> 00:03:30,686
on account of a serious
cash-flow problem...

38
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:35,136
due to a lack of missing heiresses
and dead tycoons lying in the solarium...

39
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:38,753
with lipstick stains
on their smoking jackets.

40
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:41,923
In other words, I was broke.

41
00:03:41,992 --> 00:03:45,735
This radio show was done
out of an old theater called the Fitzgerald...

42
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:48,932
and it had been on the air
since Jesus was in the third grade.

43
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:52,829
But it was still pulling in
a few hundred people on Saturday nights.

44
00:03:52,903 --> 00:03:57,661
It was a live radio variety show,
the kind that died fifty years ago...

45
00:03:57,736 --> 00:04:02,690
but somebody forgot to tell them
until this night.

46
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,405
A big corporation down in Texas
had bought up the radio station...

47
00:04:06,473 --> 00:04:09,026
and their axeman,
a guy named Cruett...

48
00:04:09,096 --> 00:04:11,584
was on his way to St. Paul
to shut the thing down...

49
00:04:11,656 --> 00:04:14,045
and turn the theater
into a parking lot.

50
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:20,993
It was curtains and everybody knew it,
but nobody said so.

51
00:04:21,064 --> 00:04:22,919
They were Midwesterners.

52
00:04:22,984 --> 00:04:27,108
They felt like if you ignored bad news,
it might go away.

53
00:04:27,176 --> 00:04:30,624
Not my philosophy,
but I'm not from here.

54
00:04:30,696 --> 00:04:32,224
Stay on the edge of the crowd.

55
00:04:32,298 --> 00:04:33,245
Keep your eyes open.

56
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,360
That's my motto.

57
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:38,498
It was my last night
of gainful employment...

58
00:04:38,568 --> 00:04:41,732
and I had a feeling
it was maybe going to be interesting.

59
00:04:46,025 --> 00:04:49,287
§ I used to work in Chicago §

60
00:04:49,353 --> 00:04:52,549
§ At a convenience store §

61
00:04:52,616 --> 00:04:55,650
§ I used to work in Chicago §

§ I did, but I don't anymore §

63

Ladies and gentlemen, we are now
at ten minutes from broadcast, please.

64
00:04:59,785 --> 00:05:00,865
Ten minutes.

65
00:05:00,937 --> 00:05:02,725

70
00:05:15,656 --> 00:05:16,966
What-OK, OK.

71
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:18,407
Jesus, the schedule.

72
00:05:18,474 --> 00:05:20,164
Uh...

73
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:21,727
Where's my pencil?
I gotta show you some changes.

74
00:05:21,801 --> 00:05:22,750
Where's my pencil?

75
00:05:22,826 --> 00:05:23,840
I just put it down here a second ago.

76
00:05:23,913 --> 00:05:25,090
Where'd you put it last?

77
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,241
I just had it here a second ago.

78
00:05:26,314 --> 00:05:27,458
Oh, it's-it's-

79
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:28,576
Don't mess with those.

80
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:30,503
Hey, hey, hey.
Please, move that back.

81
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:32,260
This one will make the-

82
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:35,012
This will make the wife
green-eyed with envy.

83
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,575
Ooh!

84
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:37,576
One more.

85
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:39,496
Do you think
she's coming by the studio?

86
00:05:39,561 --> 00:05:41,121
Cuddle up a little bit.
There you go.

87
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:44,834
Hey, Guy.
How are you tonight?

88
00:05:44,905 --> 00:05:46,214
I need a little help from you.

89
00:05:46,281 --> 00:05:48,419
Take these Johnson Girl t-shirts.
Have someone take 'em up front.

90
00:05:48,489 --> 00:05:51,010
- I'll take care of it.
- Nice tie.

91
00:05:51,081 --> 00:05:52,390
Well, it's about damn time.

92
00:05:52,457 --> 00:05:53,799
The very tardy Johnson Girls.

93
00:05:53,865 --> 00:05:54,792
Hey, Al.

94
00:05:54,857 --> 00:05:55,937
Givin' me a heart attack here.

95
00:05:56,009 --> 00:05:58,497
What is this? Rewrites?

96
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:00,358
What's wrong with the old script?

97
00:06:00,425 --> 00:06:01,353
How does that feel?

98
00:06:01,418 --> 00:06:03,043
Give me a little sound effects on that one.

99
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:05,830
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are now at six minutes to broadcast.

100
00:06:05,897 --> 00:06:07,458
Six minutes from broadcast, please.

101
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:08,610
That's the-that's the-

102
00:06:08,682 --> 00:06:10,405
Hey, Rich, that's that Honolulu mama...

103
00:06:10,474 --> 00:06:12,361
how she could dance
in her pink pajamas...

104
00:06:12,425 --> 00:06:14,466
when she took off
her Oahu Oahu Oahu.

105
00:06:14,537 --> 00:06:16,840
No, it's an old
Carter family song, right?

106
00:06:16,905 --> 00:06:17,833
A what?

107
00:06:17,898 --> 00:06:20,069
Carter family, sweetheart.

108
00:06:20,138 --> 00:06:22,276
Just like us, only famous.

109
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,326
Now, how long you been doin' this?

110
00:06:24,394 --> 00:06:26,761
Doin' what?
Puttin' my pants on?

111
00:06:26,826 --> 00:06:28,387
How long you been doin' radio?

112
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:30,149
Oh.

113
00:06:30,218 --> 00:06:32,640
I don't know.
Thirty-some years, I guess.

114
00:06:32,713 --> 00:06:35,680
Started out in Mark Twain Days,
Mississippi River...

115
00:06:35,753 --> 00:06:38,022
and they hired me to play Huck Finn.

116
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,734
I was running a raft
on the Mississippi...

117
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:44,769
and carrying people across, and, uh...

118
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:47,230
it ran into the wake of a steamboat.

119
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,314
Mr. Keillor?
We need you on stage.

120
00:06:49,385 --> 00:06:50,313
Fine. I'm right there.

121
00:06:50,378 --> 00:06:53,095
Is this the story about the guy
who ends up hangin' from a kite...

122
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,398
bein' pulled by a boat
with his shorts around his ankles?

123
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:57,953
No. No, it's a different story
about a pontoon boat.

124
00:06:58,025 --> 00:07:00,414
Oh! Look at this old house.

125
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,051
Good-bye, old house.

126
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,267
Good-bye, old porch.

127
00:07:03,337 --> 00:07:04,864
Good-bye, old Guy.

128
00:07:04,938 --> 00:07:09,542
Hey, Guy. What are they gonna do
with this house, you think? Huh?

129
00:07:09,609 --> 00:07:11,780
I figure it had somethin' to do...

130
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,917
with the dumpster
that showed up yesterday.

131
00:07:14,986 --> 00:07:16,360
Oh, my God.
Honey, listen.

132
00:07:16,426 --> 00:07:18,401
I brought you that cute little dress-

133
00:07:18,474 --> 00:07:20,515
I already told you,
I don't like the dress.

134
00:07:20,587 --> 00:07:21,513
At least try it on.

135
00:07:21,578 --> 00:07:22,560
I want to see it on you.

136
00:07:22,634 --> 00:07:23,746
You try it on.
I don't want to try it on.

137
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:24,767
It's ugly.

138
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:25,922
It's the color of vomit.

139
00:07:29,642 --> 00:07:30,919
Oh, sorry.

140
00:07:34,761 --> 00:07:38,079
Old man Soderberg was
one of those people who was on that raft...

141
00:07:38,155 --> 00:07:42,082
and, uh, he went over the rail
and into the river...

142
00:07:42,154 --> 00:07:44,871
and I went in for him
'cause he couldn't swim.

143
00:07:44,938 --> 00:07:47,840
So, I pulled him out.

144
00:07:47,914 --> 00:07:49,026
You saved his life?

145
00:07:49,098 --> 00:07:51,335
Well, not really.
The river was shallow at that point...

146
00:07:51,402 --> 00:07:53,769
but he didn't know that
'cause I had hold of his ankles.

147
00:07:53,835 --> 00:07:55,395
I was towing him into shore.

148
00:07:55,467 --> 00:07:56,579
Hey! It's good to see ya!

149
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,560
Four minutes from broadcast, please.

150
00:07:58,634 --> 00:07:59,943
Four minutes.

151
00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:02,858
Ooh! Hey.

152
00:08:02,922 --> 00:08:03,969
Hey.

153
00:08:04,042 --> 00:08:05,450
Wait a minute.
Where's my bag?

154
00:08:05,515 --> 00:08:06,627
No, no. The bag's here.

155
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:07,876
I brought it in.

156
00:08:07,947 --> 00:08:09,475
Mom, just look.

157
00:08:09,546 --> 00:08:11,073
Here it is.
Come on, Yolanda.

158
00:08:11,146 --> 00:08:14,529
<i>I swear to God I'm all,
you know, verklempt.</i>

159
00:08:14,603 --> 00:08:16,392
Ha ha ha ha!

160
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:17,506
Ohh.

161
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:18,626
Hot.

162
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:21,633
Yeah. See? Plenty of time.

163
00:08:21,706 --> 00:08:23,560
So he gave you the job at WLT.

164
00:08:23,626 --> 00:08:24,673
Well, his brother did, actually.

165
00:08:24,746 --> 00:08:25,794
Yeah, Art Soderberg.

166
00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:26,915
G.K. to the stage, please.

167
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:28,874
Art Soderberg gave you the job.

168
00:08:28,938 --> 00:08:29,986
Yeah, it was a-

169
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:31,138
It was
the early morning show, right?

170
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,600
<i>Rise and Shine Show.
Wilmer Scott, 5 A.M.</i>

171
00:08:33,675 --> 00:08:34,885
Me and Dusty used to have
an early mornin' show.

172
00:08:34,955 --> 00:08:36,232
Is that right?
Excuse me, partner.

173
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:37,378
<i>Oh, yeah.
Breakfast at the Bunkhouse.</i>

174
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,752
TV show.
And, uh, it showed mostly...

175
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,346
cartoons and stuff.
Remember that?

176
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,979
- Oh, yeah?
- For the kids.

177
00:08:43,051 --> 00:08:46,248
Well, this was-uh, this came on
at 5:00 in the morning.

178
00:08:46,314 --> 00:08:47,242
And it was-uh, like a gospel show.

179
00:08:47,307 --> 00:08:49,129
- Inspirational show.
- Inspirational show.

180
00:08:49,194 --> 00:08:50,404
Wilmer Scott was the host of it.

181
00:08:50,474 --> 00:08:52,864
Wasn't Wilmer Scott the famous aviator?

182
00:08:52,938 --> 00:08:54,083
No.

183
00:08:54,154 --> 00:08:57,450
Yeah. First man to fly the length
of the Mississippi solo.

184
00:08:57,515 --> 00:08:58,693
- No.
- I don't think so.

185
00:08:58,763 --> 00:08:59,811
Right.

186
00:08:59,883 --> 00:09:01,192
That was his brother Wilbur Scott.

187
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:02,338
We're now at three minutes...

188
00:09:02,411 --> 00:09:04,648
Flew from New Orleans to Memphis...

189
00:09:04,715 --> 00:09:07,236
all the way up to Minnesota
to Lake Itasca.

190
00:09:07,308 --> 00:09:08,354
And when he got up there,
he tried to fire a signal rocket...

191
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:10,183
out the cockpit window,
but it was closed.

192
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,145
He became the first civilian pilot
to shoot himself down.

193
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:15,267
- Ugh!
- No. That was Wilbur.

194
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,387
- You made that story up.
- Right.

195
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,506
No, I'm talking
about Wilmer Scott.

196
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:19,880
Crashed into the lake
at his moment of triumph.

197
00:09:19,947 --> 00:09:20,896
- No.
- Wilmer.

198
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:23,622
- Wilmer. Yeah. He was the host...
- No. This was the-

199
00:09:23,691 --> 00:09:25,217
<i>- Right.
- The Rise and Shine Show.</i>

200
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,535
<i>Rise and Shine.</i>

201
00:09:26,603 --> 00:09:29,418
Mr. Keillor, Al's on the verge
of a coronary up there.

202
00:09:29,483 --> 00:09:30,531
Yeah. I'm there.

203
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:31,651
Now, how did he have time
to fly and do radio?

204
00:09:31,724 --> 00:09:32,772
G.K., sit down.
I gotta do your makeup.

205
00:09:32,843 --> 00:09:35,079
You're thinking of Wilbur Scott, see?

206
00:09:35,147 --> 00:09:36,096
Yeah. It's not the same person.
Not the same person.

207
00:09:36,171 --> 00:09:37,250
- Yeah...
- He was dead.

208
00:09:37,323 --> 00:09:39,396
You know, we used
to have a dog in the act...

209
00:09:39,467 --> 00:09:41,376
when Wanda and Connie were in it...

210
00:09:41,451 --> 00:09:43,492
- and that dog would sing-
- Ooo!

211
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:44,708
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha ha ha!

212
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:47,594
We'd sing this old song
and he would howl! Ha ha ha!

213
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:49,350
Oh, my God, that was a dog.

214
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,274
- I been thinkin' about him all day long.
- Yeah.

215
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:52,801
Rusty always comes to my mind.

216
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:53,924
Does it?

217
00:09:53,997 --> 00:09:56,548

218
00:09:56,619 --> 00:09:59,369

- Oooowww!
- How-ow!

227
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:17,833
I don't know if we were
harmonizing with him...

228
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,210
or he was harmonizing with us.

My baby's coming out!

247
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:51,043
It's going to come out on
this dirty make-up room floor!

Oh! Oh! Whoa!

249
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,147
Just take it easy.

250
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,878
Just kidding.

251
00:10:55,949 --> 00:10:57,672
- Ohh! You-
- You phony!

252
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,234
Get her up out of there.

00:10:59,308 --> 00:11:01,675
You were fakin'?!
I was callin' 911!

254
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,918
I'm sorry.
They just wouldn't pay attention.

255
00:11:02,988 --> 00:11:04,843
- I had to think of something...
- I'm going to work.

256
00:11:04,908 --> 00:11:05,955
- Oh!
- Didn't mean to scare you, Donna.

257
00:11:06,028 --> 00:11:07,522
Wilmer Scott.

258
00:11:07,596 --> 00:11:08,708
- Let's go.
- Garrison!

259
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,275
Wilmer Scott was the one
who hypnotized the chickens...

260
00:11:10,348 --> 00:11:11,875
- There you go.
- on the show.

261
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:13,835
He did like, what,
four of those chickens in a row.

262
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,907
- Four or five of them.
- Who was Wilmer Scott?

263
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,468
<i>He was the host of that
Rise and Shine Show.</i>

264
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,034
Early in the morning. 5 A.M.

265
00:11:20,107 --> 00:11:22,181
That's, uh, what, uh,
G.K. got started in radio.

266
00:11:22,253 --> 00:11:23,299
Right. Gospel show.

267
00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:24,583
And he hypnotized chickens
on the radio?

268
00:11:24,652 --> 00:11:26,594
No, but he did
the chickens on this show.

269
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:27,716
On this show?

270
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:28,836
<i>Not on that Rise and Shine Show.</i>

271
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:30,185
OK.

272
00:11:30,253 --> 00:11:31,813
All right, let's dim the house lights.

273
00:11:31,884 --> 00:11:32,812
You remember when
he did those chickens?

274
00:11:32,877 --> 00:11:34,185
- Hypnotized them?
- Yep.

275
00:11:34,252 --> 00:11:35,178
Chinese chickens, right?

276
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:36,455
Kung Pao, I believe.

277
00:11:36,525 --> 00:11:37,954

<i>The sponsor. 5 A.M.

282

284
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,174
And thirty seconds to broadcast, please.

285
00:11:47,244 --> 00:11:49,480
Sassafras, and natural grain alcohol.

286

What was it called?

287
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,716

288
00:11:51,788 --> 00:11:52,835
No, it's
Piscacadawadaquoddymoggin.

289
00:11:52,908 --> 00:11:53,956
- Places, please.
- OK. Places.

290
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:55,075
That's what I said.

291
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:56,774

294
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,264
It was what Wilmer Scott
had in his coffee cup-

295
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:05,794
- Uh-huh.
- every morning.

296
00:12:05,868 --> 00:12:07,113
- 5 A.M.
- Right here.

297
00:12:07,181 --> 00:12:08,108
Then he quit drinking.

298
00:12:08,172 --> 00:12:10,474
- Uh-huh. OK.
- And he lost interest in radio.

299
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,685
Check your barn doors.

300
00:12:11,756 --> 00:12:12,967
He developed mic fright.

301
00:12:13,037 --> 00:12:14,149
How did he quit drinkin'?

302
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,169
He just quit.

303
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:17,348
- And we're on.
- Then he raised chickens.

304
00:12:17,421 --> 00:12:19,787

Hello, everybody,
on a Saturday night...

314
00:12:55,725 --> 00:12:57,416
and welcome to a live broadcast...

315
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,590
<i>of A Prairie Home Companion
coming to you...</i>

316
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:03,076
from WLT,
your friendly neighbor station.

317
00:13:03,661 --> 00:13:05,287
Noir, where you been?

318
00:13:05,357 --> 00:13:07,212
I was lookin' after the Johnson Girls.

319
00:13:07,277 --> 00:13:08,935
OK. Aren't you supposed
to be guarding the door?

320
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:10,052
Are you worried about something?

321
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,679
Uh, I had a weird call
from some crazy lady, so-

322
00:13:12,749 --> 00:13:14,156
Oh, she's not that crazy.

323
00:13:14,221 --> 00:13:15,432
How do you know?

324
00:13:15,502 --> 00:13:16,746
Because I met her
earlier this afternoon.

325
00:13:16,814 --> 00:13:18,090
She came by.

326
00:13:18,157 --> 00:13:21,191
What does she look like?
You get a description?

327
00:13:21,262 --> 00:13:22,603
Yeah, I got a description.

328
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,716
Yeah?

329
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:24,968
She was beautiful.

330
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:29,544
Her hair was what God had in mind
when he said, let there be-

331
00:13:29,613 --> 00:13:31,271
Hair. Right. Hair.

332
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,123
Hair. Yeah.

333
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,651
She gave me a smile so sweet...

334
00:13:35,725 --> 00:13:37,995
you could've poured it
on your pancakes.

335
00:13:38,062 --> 00:13:40,550
She was wearing a white
trench coat so white...

336
00:13:40,621 --> 00:13:43,490
that rain would be
embarrassed to fall on it.

337
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:44,940
Got it. Right.

338
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:46,119
The skirt she was
wearing was so tight...

339
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:49,058
you could read
the embroidery on her underwear.

340
00:13:49,133 --> 00:13:55,593
It said, "Wash in lukewarm water
and spin lightly. "

341
00:13:55,662 --> 00:13:57,188
OK, you're makin' it up.

342
00:13:57,261 --> 00:14:01,735
She had a Mount Rushmore t-shirt on,
and those guys never looked so good.

343
00:14:01,806 --> 00:14:03,595
Especially Jefferson and Lincoln.

344
00:14:03,662 --> 00:14:04,741
Right.

345
00:14:04,814 --> 00:14:07,662
Kind of bloated but happy.

346
00:14:07,726 --> 00:14:10,059
- If you know what I mean.
- Yeah.

347
00:14:10,126 --> 00:14:12,876
It was an honor just to sit there
and inhale the same air...

348
00:14:12,942 --> 00:14:15,876
that she had so recently exhaled...

349
00:14:15,949 --> 00:14:20,357
just to exchange the atmosphere
between us, so to speak.

350
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,477
Look, what did she want?

351
00:14:21,549 --> 00:14:22,891
Did she say anything about-

352
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,005
Who?

353
00:14:24,077 --> 00:14:25,604
The lady.

354
00:14:25,678 --> 00:14:28,580
Oh. She was looking for
the Presbyterian Church.

355
00:14:28,654 --> 00:14:30,510
Like a dope,
I told her where it was.

356
00:14:30,574 --> 00:14:33,443
And out of my life she went, just as...

357
00:14:33,518 --> 00:14:36,006
quickly and erotically
as she had entered it.

358
00:14:39,886 --> 00:14:41,577
Are you tired
of your current herring?

359
00:14:43,373 --> 00:14:45,795
Has it lost that certain
something that you expect...

360
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,146
in a pickled fish product?

361
00:14:49,102 --> 00:14:51,720
If so, maybe it's time you try Jens Jenson.

362
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:56,875
It's the Lake Superior herring that's made
the old-fashioned Norwegian way.

363
00:15:04,526 --> 00:15:08,717
C- can someone turn it down, please?
Please?

364
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,946
§ Yeah, Jenson Herring is the best §

365
00:15:12,014 --> 00:15:13,132
Oh, Jens Jenson's.

366
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:15,021
- Please.
- Ask for it by name.

367
00:15:15,086 --> 00:15:17,803
And if your grocer doesn't stock it,
ask him why not.

368
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,397
You know what I'm gonna do?

369
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,990
I'm gonna color my hair
strawberry blonde.

370
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:23,177
Hey.

371
00:15:23,246 --> 00:15:25,515
I swear to God, I should
have done it years ago.

372
00:15:25,582 --> 00:15:26,509
I should have broke loose...

373
00:15:26,574 --> 00:15:28,810
gone to Chicago
when Mama died back then.

374
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:30,308
That's what I should have done.

375
00:15:30,382 --> 00:15:32,074
You know, you put those things off.

376
00:15:32,142 --> 00:15:34,412
You seldom get around to them again.

377
00:15:34,478 --> 00:15:36,900
Hmm. What are you writin'?

378
00:15:36,974 --> 00:15:38,087
Poem.

379
00:15:38,158 --> 00:15:39,500
Oh, a poem.

380
00:15:39,566 --> 00:15:41,835
What's it about?

381
00:15:41,902 --> 00:15:43,364
Heh. Suicide.

382
00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:45,162
Oh, my God.

383
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,980
Oh. OK.

384
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:50,219
Well, you know what my philosophy is.

385
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:52,490
Yes, I do, so don't tell me.

386
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:57,861
I think that you gotta be grateful
for everything that happens to you...

387
00:15:57,935 --> 00:16:00,553
because that's what
got you here, you know?

388
00:16:00,623 --> 00:16:03,341
And if you hadn't gone through
all the things that you went through...

389
00:16:03,408 --> 00:16:05,546
why, you know,
you wouldn't have wound up...

390
00:16:05,616 --> 00:16:09,260
where you are now, so,
I don't know.

391
00:16:09,326 --> 00:16:10,536
Disappointment doesn't
get you anywhere.

392
00:16:10,606 --> 00:16:11,535
Anywhere.

393
00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:13,125
Aren't you wonderful?

394
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,297
Well, one door closes
and another one opens...

395
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:20,710
then, you know, everything is
a step along the way...

396
00:16:20,784 --> 00:16:22,671
and it all leads to something else.

397
00:16:22,735 --> 00:16:25,931
Pardon me if I don't
get down on my knees.

398
00:16:25,998 --> 00:16:29,163
Well, that's what I think.

399
00:16:29,231 --> 00:16:32,045
Ahem. Read me some of your poem.

400
00:16:32,111 --> 00:16:33,321
It's not finished.

401
00:16:33,391 --> 00:16:34,569
Huh?

402
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,778
OK.

403

who you were looking for?

440
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,022
No, Mr. Noir.

441
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:19,884

honestly, Lola, honest to God-

474
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:05,260
a dragonfly flew right in my mouth.

475
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,277
Oh, yeah!

476
00:20:06,352 --> 00:20:08,971
It was this big.
I thought it was a bird.

477
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:09,990
How old were you then?

478
00:20:10,065 --> 00:20:12,683
I was thirteen.
Your mother was ten.

479
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:13,899
Wanda was what?

480
00:20:13,969 --> 00:20:17,516
Wanda was sixteen.
Connie, fifteen.

481
00:20:17,586 --> 00:20:19,015
Yep.

482
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:20,944
That was the end of it.
The end of the road.

483
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:23,213
That was a great-

484
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:25,485
You know, Wanda took it
real hard, didn't she?

485
00:20:25,553 --> 00:20:27,854
A week later, she got arrested.

486
00:20:27,921 --> 00:20:30,059
For what?
You never told me this.

487
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:32,333
Shoplifting, and I did tell you this.

488
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:34,823
Mom, you're going senile.
You didn't tell me that.

489
00:20:34,897 --> 00:20:35,824
No...

490
00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:37,711
She was havin'
a cup of coffee in the cafe.

491
00:20:37,776 --> 00:20:38,987
She ordered a glazed doughnut.

492
00:20:39,057 --> 00:20:41,675
She started eatin' it
and she got a sugar rush.

493
00:20:41,745 --> 00:20:44,015
She was diagnosed hypoglycemic.

494
00:20:44,082 --> 00:20:45,969
And so, she forgets
she didn't pay for the doughnut...

495
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:47,145
and she walks out the door.

496
00:20:47,216 --> 00:20:49,072
- It wasn't two minutes-
- But they arrested her for shopliftin'.

497
00:20:49,137 --> 00:20:51,886
The red lights are flashin'
and she's in handcuffs...

498
00:20:51,954 --> 00:20:53,480
- And they had a policeman there.
- And the cameras, the TV camera-

499
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,790
- the station came right down.
- It was on the news.

500
00:20:55,857 --> 00:20:57,996
And her hair is, like, stickin' out like this
and she's bawlin'...

501
00:20:58,066 --> 00:21:00,073
and Daddy sees it
on the 10:00 newscast.

502
00:21:00,146 --> 00:21:01,935
'Cause he was
in the hospital with Mama.

503
00:21:02,002 --> 00:21:04,390
She was havin' her tubes tied
after Johnny was born.

504
00:21:04,465 --> 00:21:05,393
Thank you.

505
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,759
- Didn't need to know that.
- Well.

506
00:21:07,826 --> 00:21:12,136
Daddy sees Wanda gettin' arrested
on TV for shoplifting.

507
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,031
He has a major coronary occlusion.

508
00:21:14,097 --> 00:21:15,177
Yeah.

509
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,999
He just climbed up into
the hospital bed with Mama...

510
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:20,586
then he pulled the sheet
up over his own face...

511
00:21:20,657 --> 00:21:22,513
and when the nurse came in,
he was dead.

512
00:21:22,578 --> 00:21:24,749
That was it.
You know?

513
00:21:24,818 --> 00:21:28,396
He left a note, 'cause Wanda got
released from jail just for the funeral.

514
00:21:28,466 --> 00:21:31,814
He said, "Wanda, you broke my heart.
Signed, Daddy. "

515
00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:34,759
She did thirty days
for one glazed doughnut.

516
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:37,867
A 59-cent doughnut.
If it had been rock and roll...

517
00:21:37,938 --> 00:21:39,793
she could have
thrown sofas out of the window-

518
00:21:39,858 --> 00:21:41,930
hotel window.
No, not even her own sofa.

519
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:44,369
She could throw somebody else's sofa
out the window.

520
00:21:44,434 --> 00:21:46,474
You don't know what kind
of passersby at the bottom.

521
00:21:46,546 --> 00:21:48,401
She could have been hittin' people.
It wouldn't have mattered.

522
00:21:48,466 --> 00:21:51,280
But when you're playin' to
Christian family audiences like we were...

523
00:21:51,345 --> 00:21:53,254
you so much as forget to pay
for a damn doughnut...

524
00:21:53,329 --> 00:21:55,403
they throw you out like
a piece of garbage.

525
00:21:55,474 --> 00:21:58,093
Sooner kill you than look at you.

526
00:21:58,162 --> 00:22:00,169
Some of those good people, eh?

527
00:22:00,242 --> 00:22:03,590
The Soderberg family selling out!

528
00:22:03,665 --> 00:22:05,838
I just do not get it.

529
00:22:05,906 --> 00:22:07,466
I mean, they've owned WLT...

530
00:22:07,538 --> 00:22:09,873
since they ran it
out of a sandwich shop.

531
00:22:09,938 --> 00:22:11,760
I mean, that's what the call letters
stand for, you know.

532
00:22:11,826 --> 00:22:13,998
"With Lettuce and Tomato. "
Did you know that?

533
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:16,139
I mean, how do you just walk away
from somethin' like that?

534
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,868
I mean, what are we?
Used Kleenex?

535
00:22:17,938 --> 00:22:19,879
They got old, babe.

536
00:22:19,953 --> 00:22:23,021
They started thinking
about ease and comfort.

537
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:27,978
Then, I figure, they saw a brochure
about an island with palm trees...

538
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:31,978
and an azure sky
and miles of sand...

539
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,123
and they thought, "Hey! Ha ha!

540
00:22:34,194 --> 00:22:38,449
"We don't have to suffer through
these miserable Minnesota winters.

541
00:22:38,514 --> 00:22:41,810
"We don't have to freeze our butts off
waiting for our bus to come.

542
00:22:41,874 --> 00:22:46,381
"Our bus has come. It's here.
We'll leave the business to the kids...

543
00:22:46,451 --> 00:22:49,036
"and we'll head for paradise
and to hell with it. "

544
00:22:49,106 --> 00:22:50,034
Only trouble is...

545
00:22:50,098 --> 00:22:53,393
the kids had already gone down
to paradise ahead of them.

546
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:55,826
So then, a big corporation
down in Texas...

547
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:58,792
offered them
a gazillion dollars for it.

548
00:22:58,866 --> 00:23:00,654
Texans.

549
00:23:00,722 --> 00:23:02,217
Sure.

550
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:04,014
They talk funny
and their eyes don't focus...

551
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,930
and their flesh is rotting
and falling off...

552
00:23:06,994 --> 00:23:10,955
but hey. You know. So what?

553
00:23:11,026 --> 00:23:15,217
Yeah, nobody's perfect and, uh...
money is money...

554
00:23:15,283 --> 00:23:17,650
so, the Soderbergs took the dough.
End of story.

555
00:23:17,715 --> 00:23:19,241
Do you have any tweezers?

556
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:22,511
Egg salad or ham salad?

557
00:23:22,578 --> 00:23:24,139
Why are you crying?

558
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:26,666
Well, it's the last show.

559
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:30,219
I'm never going to see
these people again.

560
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:31,339
You'll see them again.

561
00:23:31,412 --> 00:23:34,161
I knew all of them from the old days.

562
00:23:34,226 --> 00:23:38,056
Soupy and Red, Ray.

563
00:23:38,131 --> 00:23:40,717
And Helen.

564
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:42,892
Gone and forgotten.

565
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,133
Every sparrow is remembered.

566
00:23:47,795 --> 00:23:51,090
I don't even know if they're gonna
make a speech or anything.

567
00:23:51,155 --> 00:23:53,359
It doesn't seem right, does it?

568
00:23:53,427 --> 00:23:54,354
No.

569
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:58,413
Some big company come in
and steps on us...

570
00:23:58,484 --> 00:24:00,719
like we were bugs at the picnic.

571
00:24:05,107 --> 00:24:07,954
What's in ham salad?

572
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:12,688
I- I can't remember the word. It was...

573
00:24:12,755 --> 00:24:15,024
May I...

574
00:24:15,091 --> 00:24:16,814
Maybe...

575
00:24:16,884 --> 00:24:17,811
Mayo?

576
00:24:17,876 --> 00:24:22,861
Mayonnaise.

577
00:24:22,932 --> 00:24:27,055
Well, it's an end of an era
when this show goes, guys.

578
00:24:27,123 --> 00:24:29,065
There won't be anything left
on the radio except what?

579
00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:31,724
People yellin' at you
and computers playing music.

580
00:24:31,795 --> 00:24:33,258
I mean, it's a tragedy.

581
00:24:33,332 --> 00:24:34,346
I wasn't gonna tell you this...

582
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,842
but between you and me
and the fly on the wall...

583
00:24:36,915 --> 00:24:40,112
there's a woman on the premises who
I think, maybe, is gonna save our bacon.

584
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,129
Hmm?

585
00:24:41,205 --> 00:24:42,546
She's got that look about her.

586
00:24:42,612 --> 00:24:43,560
Who is she?

587
00:24:43,635 --> 00:24:46,220
I'm not sure. I'm still working
on figuring that one out.

588
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:48,080
Just close your eyes
for a second.

589
00:24:48,148 --> 00:24:49,870
She from NorComm?

590
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,117
Time will tell.

591
00:24:51,187 --> 00:24:55,922
I'll just let personal charm
and dashing good looks do their work.

592
00:24:55,988 --> 00:24:58,159
She walked in,
couldn't take her eyes off me.

593
00:24:58,228 --> 00:25:00,781
Drawn to me like a moth to the flame.

594
00:25:01,012 --> 00:25:02,866
Every time there's
a triumph in the world...

595
00:25:02,899 --> 00:25:05,453
a million souls have to be trampled on.

596
00:25:05,524 --> 00:25:08,175
And right there-you can see it
right in the damn carpet.

597
00:25:08,244 --> 00:25:10,545
What does that have
to do with anything?

598
00:25:10,611 --> 00:25:12,434
Mama. She I-she went-

599
00:25:12,499 --> 00:25:13,612
She went up to the-

600
00:25:13,684 --> 00:25:15,659
It was a lot for Mama to put up with.

601
00:25:15,732 --> 00:25:17,936
We had to shovel her into
the Good Shepherd Home.

602
00:25:18,004 --> 00:25:19,728
That's it.
That was the sad day.

603
00:25:19,797 --> 00:25:21,203
Connie quit the act.

604
00:25:21,268 --> 00:25:22,829
God, we'd already lost Wanda.

605
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,077
Wanda was like magic.

606
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:25,838
The four of us,
when we were together...

607
00:25:25,907 --> 00:25:27,118
- she was singin'.
- She was-

608
00:25:27,187 --> 00:25:28,944
And next to you, I'm tellin' you...

609
00:25:29,012 --> 00:25:30,222
you've followed in her footsteps.

610
00:25:30,292 --> 00:25:32,397
You are the same-
the same talent.

611
00:25:32,468 --> 00:25:33,777
No. I don't know about that.

612
00:25:33,843 --> 00:25:35,054
So, now, it's just the two of us.

613
00:25:35,123 --> 00:25:36,498
Yep. Just the two of us.

614
00:25:36,564 --> 00:25:39,662
You know what?
It was your dad got us on the radio.

615
00:25:39,731 --> 00:25:42,120
God, that was
a good-lookin' family!

616
00:25:42,195 --> 00:25:44,051
I can understand you
goin' for that guy.

617
00:25:44,116 --> 00:25:45,970
Yeah, he sang like an angel.

618
00:25:46,036 --> 00:25:48,556
He sang...

619
00:25:48,628 --> 00:25:52,818
§ Softly and tenderly §

620
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:56,332

Hmm-mmm.

628
00:26:31,764 --> 00:26:34,863
Singing is the only thing
that puts me right.

629
00:26:34,933 --> 00:26:38,862
Hmm-mmm.

645
00:27:13,686 --> 00:27:14,700
Uh, not yet.
You've got a few minutes.

646
00:27:14,773 --> 00:27:15,755
What are we doin'?

647
00:27:15,829 --> 00:27:19,342
<i>You're on in the Powdermilk segment
doing Gold Watch and Chain with him.</i>

648
00:27:19,413 --> 00:27:21,933

Fine. Whatever you'd like.

657
00:27:45,141 --> 00:27:50,379
I would just like there to be
a spot for Lola on the show later.

658
00:27:50,453 --> 00:27:53,901
I hope so.
If there's time.

659
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:56,624
Well, this isn't really gonna be
your last show, is it?

660
00:27:56,695 --> 00:27:58,582
Every show's your last show.

661
00:27:58,646 --> 00:28:00,401
That's my philosophy.

662
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,852
Thank you, Plato.
Kierkegaard.

663
00:28:05,205 --> 00:28:06,515

664
00:28:06,582 --> 00:28:08,970

Hey, uh... can you tell potato face here
that his butt is too big for his pants...

676
00:28:35,222 --> 00:28:37,164
and people can see his crack...

677
00:28:37,238 --> 00:28:40,205
and it ain't nothin' any normal person
would ever care to look at?

678
00:28:40,278 --> 00:28:41,226
Where?

679
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,723
In the back.
That's where your crack is.

680
00:28:43,797 --> 00:28:44,725
Well, I don't see nothin'.

681
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,157
- Hey, Molly.
- Don't talk to me.

682
00:28:47,222 --> 00:28:48,334
Am I decent back there?

683
00:28:48,406 --> 00:28:50,642
Don't ask me.
I'm not your mother.

684
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:53,524
You might be decent
if you lost 25 pounds of ugly fat.

685
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:56,339
And I might suggest
cuttin' off your head.

686
00:28:56,406 --> 00:28:58,577
She showed me her tattoo once.

687
00:28:58,646 --> 00:28:59,955
Hell she did.

688
00:29:00,022 --> 00:29:01,713
On her shoulder.

689
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,342
You're lyin' through your teeth.

690
00:29:03,414 --> 00:29:04,494
Left shoulder.
Right here.

691
00:29:04,566 --> 00:29:06,420
- That ain't the shoulder.
- Whatever you want to call it.

692
00:29:06,486 --> 00:29:07,468
I'd call it the clavicle.

693
00:29:07,542 --> 00:29:08,654
OK, well, why don't you
ask her about it?

694
00:29:08,726 --> 00:29:09,774
Maybe she'll let you have a look.

695
00:29:09,847 --> 00:29:11,373
Well, what did it say?

696
00:29:11,446 --> 00:29:12,590
It said, "Freedom. "

697
00:29:12,661 --> 00:29:14,517
Fr-Now I know you're lyin'.

698
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:16,916
Come on. We gotta put out the CDs.

699
00:29:16,981 --> 00:29:19,600
Come on, niece.

700
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,579
Hey. Molly.

701
00:29:21,654 --> 00:29:23,477
Molly, here.
Take these out front.

702
00:29:23,543 --> 00:29:27,187
Did you hear about the Soderbergs
sellin' the radio station?

703
00:29:27,254 --> 00:29:29,294
I heard all about it.

704
00:29:29,366 --> 00:29:30,708
Are you OK?

705
00:29:30,775 --> 00:29:33,710
Yes, of course.
Hmm?

706
00:29:33,782 --> 00:29:35,604
Kind of a bizarre feeling, isn't it?

707
00:29:35,671 --> 00:29:37,841
- What?
- The silence.

708
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:39,698
What?

709
00:29:39,766 --> 00:29:41,708
Well...

710
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:43,212
you're gonna say somethin' about it.

711
00:29:43,287 --> 00:29:44,629
You're gonna talk
to the people, aren't you?

712
00:29:44,695 --> 00:29:47,344
Say, "Thanks for listening,"
or something.

713
00:29:47,413 --> 00:29:48,559
Yeah, you know.

714
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,578
I don't think so.

715
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:50,734
Why not?
Say, "Thank you. "

716
00:29:50,806 --> 00:29:52,399
What?

717
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,740
I'm just not into making big speeches.

718
00:29:54,807 --> 00:29:55,984
What do you do when you
leave somebody's house?

719
00:29:56,054 --> 00:29:57,101
You don't just turn around-

720
00:29:57,174 --> 00:29:59,695
I don't make a big speech.
A big weepy speech.

721
00:29:59,767 --> 00:30:03,476
Oh, that's it!
You're afraid that you're gonna cry!

722
00:30:03,542 --> 00:30:04,752
I wouldn't.

723
00:30:04,822 --> 00:30:07,692
Yeah, that's right.
That's true. You wouldn't.

724
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:11,540
And you know, that's why, I think,
that our romance was so short.

725
00:30:11,606 --> 00:30:14,606
Because I knew that when we broke up,
you would not cry...

726
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:16,566
so, I got way over it.

727
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:19,406
Does that make sense to you?

728
00:30:19,479 --> 00:30:20,406
No, not at all.

729
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:24,365
Bebopareebop Frozen Rhubarb Pie
and Frozen Rhubarb Pie Filling.

730
00:30:24,438 --> 00:30:28,366
Wouldn't this be a good time
for a piece of rhubarb pie?

731
00:30:28,438 --> 00:30:30,828
§ Yes, one little thing can revive a guy §

732
00:30:30,902 --> 00:30:33,106

733
00:30:33,175 --> 00:30:35,543

Yes, Bebopareebop Rhubarb Pie.

740
00:30:51,254 --> 00:30:52,433
And now, for Bebopareebop...

741
00:30:52,503 --> 00:30:55,470
please welcome one of radio's
great singing families...

742
00:30:55,543 --> 00:30:58,293
the Johnson Girls,
Rhonda and Yolanda.

743
00:30:59,414 --> 00:31:01,138
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi.

744
00:31:01,335 --> 00:31:04,631
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
Thank you very much.

745
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:08,078
I just want to say right away
how happy I am...

746
00:31:08,151 --> 00:31:11,566
that my daughter Lola
is here tonight.

747
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:12,915
- Come on, Lola.
- Oh! Thank you, sweetheart.

748
00:31:12,984 --> 00:31:13,966
They want to see you.

749
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,982
It means a lot to me that you came.

750
00:31:16,056 --> 00:31:19,284
Yeah, I named my little girl Lola
after our own mother.

751
00:31:19,351 --> 00:31:20,333
Yeah, Lola was our mom.

752
00:31:20,407 --> 00:31:25,044
Lola. And tonight,
we're gonna sing...

753
00:31:25,111 --> 00:31:28,144
an old song that our mother loved.

754
00:31:28,214 --> 00:31:29,425
Oh, it's one of her favorites.

755
00:31:29,495 --> 00:31:32,365
Yep. She was our inspiration.

756
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,684
Some of you know this story...

757
00:31:33,752 --> 00:31:38,639
but she's the main reason
that we started makin' music originally...

758
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:42,355
because you know she-

759
00:31:42,423 --> 00:31:44,879
it was the only way we knew
to make her happy.

760
00:31:44,952 --> 00:31:48,596
She'd be down on the kitchen floor
scrubbin' on her knees.

761
00:31:48,663 --> 00:31:51,696
But if you stood in the doorway
and you sang a song that she liked...

762
00:31:51,767 --> 00:31:54,615
why, she would just look up and smile.

763
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,264
Ha ha!
Worn out as she was...

764
00:31:57,335 --> 00:32:00,881
it was a smile as wide
as the Mississippi. Heh heh.

765
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,767
Down at the mouth.

766
00:32:03,831 --> 00:32:06,320
Not so slow, you sons of bitches.
I'll break your necks.

767
00:32:06,393 --> 00:32:07,505
- Yeah.
- I mean it.

768
00:32:07,576 --> 00:32:09,463
And you could see her gold tooth.

769
00:32:11,607 --> 00:32:16,942
§ Way down upon
that old Mississippi River §

770
00:32:17,015 --> 00:32:21,904

I can see my mama's sweet, sweet face
every Sunday morning.

784
00:33:20,761 --> 00:33:25,168
All the good old hymns, praise God,
that we've sung.

785
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:30,324
We knelt in prayer right beside
our precious aunts and uncles...

786
00:33:30,392 --> 00:33:36,087
§ Who loved us when we were young §

787
00:33:36,152 --> 00:33:38,323

00:35:29,177 --> 00:35:31,184
Why pay more for fancy food...

823
00:35:31,257 --> 00:35:34,967
when what you really want
is meatloaf, squash...

824
00:35:35,098 --> 00:35:36,853

Mr. Chuck Akers, come out here
and give us a song.

830
00:35:49,178 --> 00:35:51,827
The sweet singer of Kandiyohi County...

00:35:57,945 --> 00:35:58,873
Thank you, sir.

835
00:35:58,937 --> 00:36:02,516
Uh, we would like to bring a song
to all of our fans.

836
00:36:02,586 --> 00:36:05,106
Now, that's kind of tough to do,
'cause we're all over the place.

837
00:36:05,178 --> 00:36:07,185
Take me.
Yeah, I've bounced all over.

838
00:36:07,258 --> 00:36:12,147
I've done tent shows, schoolhouses,
uh, parkin' lots...

839
00:36:12,218 --> 00:36:15,665
the back of trucks,
movie theaters, auditoriums.

840
00:36:15,738 --> 00:36:17,428
I've even done churches.

841
00:36:17,497 --> 00:36:19,024
Now, that's hard to believe, I know.

842
00:36:19,097 --> 00:36:20,919
Anyway, this song is for you.

843
00:36:20,985 --> 00:36:23,888
And we mean every word of it,
all right?

844
00:36:23,962 --> 00:36:25,337

- Hey, Lola.
- Hi.

860
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:05,010
Heard you're gonna sing a song for us,
lookin' forward to that.

861
00:37:05,081 --> 00:37:07,024
Oh, no. I don't-maybe.

862
00:37:07,098 --> 00:37:08,560
Well, it sure would mean
the world to your mom.

863
00:37:08,634 --> 00:37:10,041
She always said you had talent.

864
00:37:10,107 --> 00:37:12,474
Yeah, I don't-I don't really know
any of their songs.

865
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:13,881
I only know my own songs.

866
00:37:13,947 --> 00:37:15,354
Well, sing one of them then.

867
00:37:15,419 --> 00:37:17,524
They're mostly about death.

868
00:37:17,594 --> 00:37:19,120
Oh.

869
00:37:19,194 --> 00:37:21,561
Well, lotta good songs about death.

870
00:37:21,627 --> 00:37:23,831
All mine are about suicide.

871
00:37:23,899 --> 00:37:25,622
Oh.

872
00:37:25,691 --> 00:37:29,269
Yeah, you know, um,
hangin' yourself with an extension cord...

873
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:31,989
- carbon monoxide, overdose...
- Hey, ahem...

874
00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:35,670
<i>you know, we could do, uh,
Amazing Grace together.</i>

875
00:37:35,738 --> 00:37:36,850
<i>I know Amazing Grace.</i>

876
00:37:36,923 --> 00:37:38,100
Yeah?
Well, hey, look.

877
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:40,024
I'll play the guitar,
we'll sing it together...

878
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,017
we'll bring this house down.

879
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:42,010
You know, I don't know
if you knew this...

880
00:37:42,075 --> 00:37:43,896
- about my friend Dusty here-
- Hey, hey.

881
00:37:43,963 --> 00:37:46,614
But he learned to sing gospel music
in San Quentin.

882
00:37:46,683 --> 00:37:47,861
And full shush.

883
00:37:47,931 --> 00:37:48,879
Yes sir, that's where I met him.

884
00:37:48,955 --> 00:37:50,416
I was with Johnny Cash,
singin' in prisons.

885
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,505
Shut the pie hole.

886
00:37:51,578 --> 00:37:52,953
There were all these
heinous, depraved criminals...

887
00:37:53,018 --> 00:37:54,960
- And well-
- Liar, liar. Whatever, moron.

888
00:37:55,034 --> 00:37:56,082
<i>He sang Amazing Grace...</i>

889
00:37:56,154 --> 00:37:58,707
and it almost made you forget
what he'd done.

890
00:37:58,778 --> 00:38:00,185
Which I don't wanna talk about.

891
00:38:00,251 --> 00:38:02,585
You know, you are so dumb,
you may be twins.

892
00:38:02,651 --> 00:38:05,171
He made me promise on a Bible
that I would never tell, and I won't.

893
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:07,381
So let that be the end of it.
Let me just say this, though.

894
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,076
Watch out for hugs.

895
00:38:10,363 --> 00:38:11,507
Heh!

896
00:38:11,578 --> 00:38:12,789
Right.

897
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,649
§ If ever I §

898
00:38:14,715 --> 00:38:17,016

904
00:38:30,939 --> 00:38:32,183
Thank you. Thank you.

905
00:38:33,819 --> 00:38:34,931
Thank you, G.K.

906
00:38:36,092 --> 00:38:38,130
Mr. Chuck Akers!

907
00:38:38,202 --> 00:38:39,698
Thank you, Chuck.

908
00:38:39,772 --> 00:38:41,298
Robin and Linda Williams.

909
00:38:41,691 --> 00:38:43,448
Let's come in here now
with a word about ketchup.

910
00:38:43,516 --> 00:38:47,345
Yes, ketchup, made from tomatoes
that contain natural sunshine...

911
00:38:47,419 --> 00:38:49,753
which we need in this part
of the country.

912
00:38:49,818 --> 00:38:51,194
We are not a sunshiny people.

913
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,464
We're not a paradise people
or a beach people.

914
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:54,961
We are dark people.

915
00:38:55,036 --> 00:38:57,108
People who believed it could be worse.

916
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,319
And we're waiting
for it to become worse.

917
00:38:59,387 --> 00:39:01,754
We come from people
who brought us up to believe...

918
00:39:01,819 --> 00:39:03,794
that life is a struggle...

919
00:39:03,867 --> 00:39:05,907
and if you should
ever feel really happy...

920
00:39:05,979 --> 00:39:08,215
be patient. This will pass.

921
00:39:08,283 --> 00:39:09,395
- Ha ha ha.
- So we could...

922
00:39:09,466 --> 00:39:10,395
When do you guys go on?

923
00:39:10,459 --> 00:39:14,584
As soon as ol' spud butt here
shuts his yapper.

924
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:15,797
Thanks for the encouragement.

925
00:39:15,868 --> 00:39:17,755
Hey, you are gonna be great.
Give me a hug.

926
00:39:17,819 --> 00:39:18,518
All right, guys.

927
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:19,989
More show in just a moment...

928
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,548
but let's come in here now
with a word about shoes!

929
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:24,659
That's Guy's Shoes. Boys...

930
00:39:24,731 --> 00:39:27,033
§ Talkin' shoes §

931
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:28,757
§ Talkin' Guy's §

932
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:32,601
§ Any two, any size §

933
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:34,675
§ From your ankles to your toes §

934
00:39:34,748 --> 00:39:36,602
§ At the bottom of your clothes §

935
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:38,390
§ You're talkin' shoes §

936
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,889
§ Talkin' Guy's §

937
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,875
Yes, Guy's Shoes.
They're made to last.

938
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,788
Ask about those Guy's Cash Shoes,
with the hole in the soles...

939
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:48,634
so you stash your cash
when you're out on the trail.

940
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,780
Isn't that right, Lefty?

941
00:39:49,852 --> 00:39:51,096
That's where I keep mine, G.K.

942
00:39:51,163 --> 00:39:52,472
All right.
Let's welcome 'em now...

943
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,969
the old trail hands here...

944
00:39:54,043 --> 00:39:57,339
the Pachelbels of the prairie,
the Brahmses of the bunkhouse...

945
00:39:57,405 --> 00:39:59,030
here they are,
Dusty and Lefty.

946
00:39:59,101 --> 00:40:00,955
- Good to have you with us.
- Well, thank you, Garrison.

947
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,581
Yes sir, it's good to be back on the show...

948
00:40:02,653 --> 00:40:05,368
because, you know, it gets
mighty lonesome out there on the prairie.

949
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:07,957
And a cowboy gets
tired of scenery after a while.

950
00:40:08,028 --> 00:40:10,962
You get, well,
sceneried out, and uh...

951
00:40:11,035 --> 00:40:14,352
sort of wish you had
somebody to talk to.

952
00:40:14,428 --> 00:40:15,356
Somebody smart.

953
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,348
- Hmm.
- Ha ha ha.

954
00:40:16,412 --> 00:40:19,761
So you're lonesome for people, huh?

955
00:40:19,837 --> 00:40:21,592
Well, you know, it's true, Garrison.

956
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,955
And, uh, it-it ain't the same
just talkin' to your horse.

957
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:26,711
My horse is extremely smart.

958
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,984
Uh, he knows math.

959
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:31,507
He knows physics and chemistry...

960
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,719
but I can't seem
to teach him philosophy.

961
00:40:33,788 --> 00:40:35,348
Can't teach him philosophy, eh?

962
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,591
Well, no. You can't put Descartes
before the horse.

963
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,588
- Aw...
- Ha ha ha.

964
00:40:38,652 --> 00:40:39,733
That was a good one, you know?

965
00:40:40,861 --> 00:40:43,032
Well, what do you reckon
we sing a song, Dusty?

966
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,310
Well, let's do it, Lefty.

967
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,202
One, two, you know what to do.

968
00:40:51,261 --> 00:40:53,049
§ I'm just an old cowboy §

969
00:40:53,116 --> 00:40:54,873
§ With twigs in my hair §

970
00:40:54,941 --> 00:40:56,850
§ Two-thirds alligator §

971
00:40:56,925 --> 00:40:58,834
§ And three-quarters bear §

972
00:40:58,908 --> 00:41:00,883
§ And one half a lion §

973
00:41:00,956 --> 00:41:02,648
§ But let it be known §

974
00:41:02,717 --> 00:41:04,472
§ I never told one lie §

975
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,101
§ That was not my own §

§ Whoopi-ti-yi-yo §

977
00:41:08,412 --> 00:41:12,374
§ Get along, little dogie §

978
00:41:12,444 --> 00:41:14,267
§ I eat when I'm hungry §

00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:16,056

00:41:17,981 --> 00:41:19,606

§ I think what I please §

§ Are the finest I've seen §

§ Whoopi-ti-yi-yo... §

987
00:41:29,437 --> 00:41:31,925
So my mom said, um...

988
00:41:31,997 --> 00:41:33,819
my mom said, you got into radio...

989
00:41:33,885 --> 00:41:37,627
uh, when someone was flying a kite
whose clothes came off? Ha.

990
00:41:37,693 --> 00:41:39,701
A naked man flying.
Quite a sight.

991
00:41:39,774 --> 00:41:41,595
Why didn't he pull his shorts up?

992
00:41:42,972 --> 00:41:45,843
He was hanging on to the kite,
couldn't let go.

993
00:41:45,918 --> 00:41:47,477
- He was up high.
- Ha.

994
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:49,437
A hundred feet up in the air...

995
00:41:49,502 --> 00:41:51,027
fifty.

996
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,409
Ha.

997
00:41:52,477 --> 00:41:54,516
So, how did that get you into radio?

998
00:41:54,588 --> 00:41:56,693
Well, that was how I met your dad.

999
00:41:57,693 --> 00:41:58,773
Here comes the solo.

1000
00:42:07,869 --> 00:42:09,810
Yeah, real good.
Real good.

1001
00:42:09,885 --> 00:42:11,347
- Wait, naked guy...
- Yeah?

1002
00:42:11,421 --> 00:42:12,599
- Was my dad?
- Right.

1003
00:42:12,669 --> 00:42:13,945
Ha.

1004
00:42:14,013 --> 00:42:17,624
Naked man with red swim trunks
around his ankles.

1005
00:42:17,693 --> 00:42:19,318
Couple thousand people saw it...

1006
00:42:19,389 --> 00:42:21,592
so we figured it was a good time
to leave town...

1007
00:42:21,662 --> 00:42:25,077
so we got a car,
and we headed down to Chicago.

1008
00:42:25,149 --> 00:42:26,076
§ We ride in the snow §

1009
00:42:26,142 --> 00:42:28,181
§ And we ride in the rain §

1010
00:42:28,253 --> 00:42:29,977
§ Just like Gene Autry §

1011
00:42:30,046 --> 00:42:32,217
§ Just like John Wayne §

1012
00:42:32,286 --> 00:42:33,845
§ They were better cowboys §

1013
00:42:33,917 --> 00:42:35,576
§ Than us and I mean it §

1014
00:42:35,646 --> 00:42:37,369
§ But we are still livin' §

1015
00:42:37,437 --> 00:42:39,347
§ And that is convenient §

1016
00:42:39,422 --> 00:42:40,436
§ Huh! §

1017
00:42:40,509 --> 00:42:42,003
§ Pi-ti-yi-yo §

1018

§ Get along, little dogie §

1019
00:42:45,342 --> 00:42:46,269
§ Huh! §

1020
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:47,675
§ Pi-ti-yi-yo §

1021
00:42:47,741 --> 00:42:51,571
§ Get along, little dogies §

1022
00:42:53,694 --> 00:42:55,320
I go in to pay for the gas...

1023
00:42:55,358 --> 00:42:58,075
and he wakes up and decides
he needs to use the men's room.

1024
00:42:58,141 --> 00:42:59,898
So I come back.

1025
00:42:59,965 --> 00:43:02,332
I think he's still sleeping
in the back seat...

1026
00:43:02,397 --> 00:43:06,172
and I get behind the wheel,
and I drive to Chicago.

1027
00:43:06,238 --> 00:43:07,513
I leave him there in Oshkosh.

1028
00:43:07,581 --> 00:43:12,601
And he goes into the cafe,
and your mother was the waitress.

1029
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:13,651
That's how they met.

1030
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:15,732
That's how I came to be born.

1031
00:43:15,805 --> 00:43:19,067
Well, it kind of led to that, yeah.

1032
00:43:19,133 --> 00:43:21,272
Yeah, but I mean if you had
looked in the back seat...

1033
00:43:21,342 --> 00:43:23,829
and-and seen that he wasn't there,
I wouldn't exist.

1034
00:43:23,902 --> 00:43:28,474
Well, he and I weren't getting along
that well, so that's why.

1035
00:43:29,822 --> 00:43:30,869
That's really strange.

1036
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:34,138
Well, no. I think it's one...

1037
00:43:34,206 --> 00:43:36,594
of the most beautiful things
I ever did not do.

1038
00:43:39,646 --> 00:43:42,645
So how'd you get into radio then?

1039
00:43:42,717 --> 00:43:45,533
<i>Well, there was a show called, uh,
The Baked Bean Jubilee.</i>

1040
00:43:45,598 --> 00:43:47,453
- Yeah, with my dad.
- With your dad, right.

1041
00:43:47,518 --> 00:43:49,427
- Happy Baked Beans.

1042
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:51,706

1043
00:43:51,774 --> 00:43:52,702

Shh! Keep your voices down!

00:43:55,901 --> 00:43:58,236
- Keep your voices down!
- § Made of natural fiber §

1047
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,230

- § You're my man §
- Mmm. Hmm!

1055
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:36,020
§ Ahh, ooh, you do what- §

1056
00:44:36,414 --> 00:44:37,822
Let's come in here now
with some cards and letters...

1057
00:44:37,855 --> 00:44:40,222
from the friends
and neighbors out there.

1058
00:44:40,286 --> 00:44:42,556
So good to know that
you're out there listening.

1059
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:45,372
Here's a little note here from Aaron...

1060
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:47,577
who says our show is a source
of comfort and laughter for him.

1061
00:44:47,646 --> 00:44:49,883
- And he's hoping-
- And he's hopin' that the Johnson Girls-

1062
00:44:49,951 --> 00:44:50,998
he's goin' to hear them
shake their hips a little...

1063
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:53,656
<i>and sing Touch me,
Kiss me, Be my man.</i>

1064
00:44:53,727 --> 00:44:55,581
No, he was just joking, he says.

1065
00:44:55,647 --> 00:44:56,693
Just joking about that.

1066
00:44:56,766 --> 00:44:59,668
<i>He was hoping that we would sing, uh,
Gold Watch and Chain.</i>

1067
00:44:59,742 --> 00:45:00,855
- Oh. Oh, I bet.
- Yolanda.

1068
00:45:00,927 --> 00:45:02,104
Yolanda and I.

1069
00:45:02,175 --> 00:45:03,636
So let's bring up Yolanda here.

1070
00:45:03,709 --> 00:45:06,809
<i>This beautiful old song
Gold Watch and Chain. Boys.</i>

1071
00:45:12,223 --> 00:45:16,730
§ Darlin', how can I stay
here without you? §

1072
00:45:16,799 --> 00:45:21,304
§ I have nothing
to ease my poor heart §

1073
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:25,782
§ All the world would seem sad,
dear, without you §

1074
00:45:25,854 --> 00:45:30,427
§ Tell me now that we never will part §

1075
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:35,066
§ I will pawn you
my gold watch and chain, love §

1076
00:45:35,134 --> 00:45:39,576
§ I will pawn you
my gold wedding ring §

1077
00:45:39,647 --> 00:45:41,786
§ I will pawn you this... §

1078
00:45:41,855 --> 00:45:43,196
- Molly?
- What?

1079
00:45:43,263 --> 00:45:44,375
Would you come here a moment?

1080
00:45:45,438 --> 00:45:46,616
What is it, Guy?

1081
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:50,548
Um, I just want to...

1082
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:52,030
Oh...

1083
00:45:52,095 --> 00:45:54,616
You are fat.

1084
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:02,836
Y- you might think about cutting down
on the, um, desserts and the beer.

1085
00:46:02,911 --> 00:46:05,813
And also possibly sex with men.

1086
00:46:05,887 --> 00:46:09,630
W- when did-
when did this take place?

1087
00:46:09,695 --> 00:46:11,036
Who-who did this to you?

1088
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:16,729
Ahh, yes, Lefty, Dusty,
are-are you boys aware of this?

1089
00:46:16,799 --> 00:46:20,116
O- our little girl's going
to be a-a single mom.

1090
00:46:20,192 --> 00:46:22,047
- You poor thing.
- Thank you.

1091
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,446
I'll swear on a stack of Bibles
it wasn't me, darlin'.

1092
00:46:24,512 --> 00:46:27,413
Oh, that's great
to know, Dusty. Thanks.

1093
00:46:27,487 --> 00:46:29,397
§ Do not scorn her §

1094
00:46:29,472 --> 00:46:33,399
§ With words fierce and bitter §

1095
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:38,622
§ Do not laugh
at her shame and downfall §

1096
00:46:38,688 --> 00:46:39,736
You should sit.

1097
00:46:39,808 --> 00:46:44,313
§ For a moment,
just stop and consider §

1098
00:46:44,383 --> 00:46:45,431
Just ignore them.

1099
00:46:45,504 --> 00:46:51,614
§ That a man
was the cause of it all §

1100
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:52,988
Dusty!

1101
00:46:53,055 --> 00:46:54,517
Yo!

1102
00:46:54,592 --> 00:46:55,639
That reminds me.

1103
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:58,101
About that obscene song
you sang last week.

1104
00:46:58,176 --> 00:46:59,800
- Obscene? Uh-
- Yeah.

1105
00:46:59,871 --> 00:47:02,359
"I'll give you my moonshine
if you show me your jugs"?

1106
00:47:02,432 --> 00:47:04,374
No, not that one.

1107
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,587
"Lovin' you ain't easy,
but I hear your sister is"?

1108
00:47:06,656 --> 00:47:08,893
No, no, no.
"Come ride my pony all night long.

1109
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,032
"Come ride him bareback,
I'll sing you a song. " That one.

1110
00:47:11,104 --> 00:47:12,729
That's just a song
about ridin' a pony.

1111
00:47:12,799 --> 00:47:14,622
Mmm.

1112
00:47:14,688 --> 00:47:16,575
Oh, what-what the hell
did you think it was about?

1113
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,647
Let's go out with a little style, OK?

1114
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,766
What do you say?

1115
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:21,400
"Go out"?
What do you mean?

1116
00:47:21,472 --> 00:47:22,520
Just what I said.

1117
00:47:22,593 --> 00:47:24,502
"Go out?" You mean me?

1118
00:47:24,576 --> 00:47:25,950
All of us.

1119
00:47:26,016 --> 00:47:27,871
What the Sam Hill are you
talkin' about, mister?

1120
00:47:27,936 --> 00:47:28,863
- Ohh. Hold on.
- Hey.

1121
00:47:28,927 --> 00:47:30,902
Got some nice egg salad sandwiches
if you're hungry.

1122
00:47:30,976 --> 00:47:31,959
No gunplay backstage.

1123
00:47:32,033 --> 00:47:33,788
I'm hungry.
I'm always hungry.

1124
00:47:33,856 --> 00:47:35,263
Did you know
that she's pregnant?

1125
00:47:35,328 --> 00:47:37,882
§ And can't be returned §

1126
00:47:37,953 --> 00:47:42,263
§ You have left me
and gone to another §

1127
00:47:42,337 --> 00:47:46,809
§ All my hopes
and bridges are burned §

1128
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,517
§ But I will pawn you
my gold watch and chain, love §

1129
00:47:51,585 --> 00:47:56,406
§ And I will pawn you
my gold wedding ring §

1130
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:01,020
§ I will pawn you
this heart in my bosom §

1131
00:48:01,089 --> 00:48:14,559
§ Only say that you'll love me again §

1132
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:15,999
Hee hee.

1133
00:48:18,144 --> 00:48:18,973
Thank you, Yolanda.

1134
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,731
What a beautiful, beautiful song.

1135
00:48:20,801 --> 00:48:22,710
This portion of our show
is brought to you...

1136
00:48:22,784 --> 00:48:24,378
by Powdermilk Biscuits...

1137
00:48:24,449 --> 00:48:27,415
and also brought to you by duct tape.

1138
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:29,049
Duct tape.
Yes, duct tape.

1139
00:48:29,121 --> 00:48:31,325
Duct tape.

1140
00:48:31,393 --> 00:48:33,465
Useful thing around the household...

1141
00:48:33,537 --> 00:48:36,472
almost anything that comes
up around the household.

1142
00:48:36,545 --> 00:48:39,392
Sometimes you need to make repairs,
doors come loose...

1143
00:48:39,457 --> 00:48:42,206
and windows,
all sorts of things can happen.

1144
00:48:42,273 --> 00:48:46,234
Sometimes you just forget something
that you're looking for...

1145
00:48:46,305 --> 00:48:48,028
and duct tape can come in handy.

1146
00:48:48,096 --> 00:48:51,391
You can wrap it around your finger
like a string or something.

1147
00:48:51,457 --> 00:48:52,886
You can just tape it up.
Whatever.

1148
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,389
Things do tend to fall apart, you know.

1149
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:58,457
Confusion reins endemic
in our world today.

1150
00:48:58,528 --> 00:49:00,384
- Just things tend to drift-
- Oh, jeez.

1151
00:49:00,449 --> 00:49:02,784
And especially as you get to be older...

1152
00:49:02,849 --> 00:49:04,856
duct tape is
the most useful thing you'll find.

1153
00:49:04,929 --> 00:49:07,351
All repairs are short term.
We know that.

1154
00:49:07,426 --> 00:49:11,581
Say a faucet should be dripping
and you, and you...

1155
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,742
The water is falling there,
dripping onto your cupboard...

1156
00:49:14,817 --> 00:49:17,785
and the-and the wood
comes loose from the wall...

1157
00:49:17,857 --> 00:49:19,547
and you need something to fix it.

1158
00:49:19,617 --> 00:49:22,105
Just reach for a roll of duct tape.

1159
00:49:22,177 --> 00:49:24,316
That would be the-the perfect thing.

1160
00:49:24,385 --> 00:49:27,351
Or maybe your orangutano's
been jumpin' up and down on it.

1161
00:49:28,993 --> 00:49:31,294
The weight of the orangutan has,
like, you know, crushed-

1162
00:49:31,361 --> 00:49:32,736
uh, crushed part of the counter.

1163
00:49:32,801 --> 00:49:34,328
And-and then your Rottweiler...

1164
00:49:34,401 --> 00:49:36,856
he comes runnin' out and
he bites the orangutan in the hinder.

1165
00:49:36,929 --> 00:49:38,555
Gets him all riled up.

1166
00:49:39,232 --> 00:49:40,160
Hey.

1167
00:49:40,225 --> 00:49:42,614
The Rottweiler, actually,
is locked in the basement.

1168
00:49:42,689 --> 00:49:43,616
Sorry to correct you there, Rhonda.

1169
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:44,695
I can hear them goin' at it.

1170
00:49:44,769 --> 00:49:46,941
- He's down locked in the basement.
- The Rottweiler and the orangutan.

1171
00:49:47,009 --> 00:49:48,057
A double lock there.

1172
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:49,558
Because the-
uh, the orangutan, you know...

1173
00:49:49,633 --> 00:49:52,088
They got, uh, the fingers
and he's got a saw.

1174
00:49:53,729 --> 00:49:55,255
A chainsaw.

1175
00:49:56,449 --> 00:49:58,784
He cut a big hole in the door
and the Rottweiler got out.

1176
00:49:58,849 --> 00:50:01,370
That's how he bit the orangutan
in the hinder.

1177
00:50:03,457 --> 00:50:05,694
And then-and then
don't forget about the peacock.

1178
00:50:07,649 --> 00:50:09,559
And then the flock.
Uh, overhead there was...

1179
00:50:09,633 --> 00:50:11,456
a big helicopter
came flyin' through.

1180
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:15,384
Right through a flock
of Canadian geese.

1181
00:50:17,058 --> 00:50:19,992
And, uh, really was gettin'
someone's goose was cooked.

1182
00:50:20,065 --> 00:50:21,080
And then they startled the peacock.

1183
00:50:22,818 --> 00:50:23,865
Yeah! Then-

1184
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:24,986
And then this-this sick-

1185
00:50:25,058 --> 00:50:26,105
- The peacock.
- No, wait.

1186
00:50:26,178 --> 00:50:29,887
This sadist-this sadist in uh, sneakers
was creepin' up on everybody.

1187
00:50:29,954 --> 00:50:33,979
And the peacock, he-uh-
he jumps right at the orangutan.

1188
00:50:34,049 --> 00:50:36,188
His beak...

1189
00:50:36,258 --> 00:50:40,000
yeah... is flashing like a scimitar.

1190
00:50:40,066 --> 00:50:44,059
Yeah, but the, uh, but his aim is-
uh, goes awry and it-and then, um-

1191
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:45,307
He takes that chainsaw and he throws it.

1192
00:50:45,377 --> 00:50:47,679
The orangutan throws it
at the peacock.

1193
00:50:47,745 --> 00:50:49,054
But he's got a bad aim.
The aim.

1194
00:50:49,122 --> 00:50:51,577
It goes right through a plate-glass window.

1195
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:52,697
But it almost-

1196
00:50:54,209 --> 00:50:55,638
Yeah-hits the mailman.

1197
00:50:55,714 --> 00:50:56,761
Wow! Oh!

1198
00:50:56,833 --> 00:51:00,215
Murray. But doesn't.
It misses him by inches.

1199
00:51:00,289 --> 00:51:05,243
And by the way, he's bringin' you a letter
from your ex-girlfriend. Remember her?

1200
00:51:05,314 --> 00:51:08,576
Who is still furious at you
for having dumped her.

1201
00:51:08,642 --> 00:51:12,799
You know, just thrown her aside,
the woman who loved you.

1202
00:51:12,866 --> 00:51:14,076
Just because
you found somebody new.

1203
00:51:14,145 --> 00:51:15,739
How could you do that?

1204
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:19,355
She will never understand.
And, um...

1205
00:51:19,425 --> 00:51:21,979
duct tape isn't gonna
help you with that one bit.

1206
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:23,195
No, I suppose not, but with two out of-

1207
00:51:23,266 --> 00:51:25,371
And duct tape is not gonna make
an honest man out of you.

1208
00:51:26,498 --> 00:51:30,076
No, it won't. But with two out of three
chores around the home, duct tape.

1209
00:51:30,146 --> 00:51:31,902
And it isn't even gonna help you
find whatever it was...

1210
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:34,458
you were lookin' for, so-
what were you lookin' for?

1211
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:35,959
I was lookin' for duct tape.
Duct tape.

1212
00:51:36,035 --> 00:51:37,889
All repairs are temporary and short term.

1213
00:51:37,955 --> 00:51:39,034
It's almost just about the only thing...

1214
00:51:39,106 --> 00:51:42,586
that really works sometimes,
and that is duct tape.

1215

1216
00:51:45,058 --> 00:51:48,320
right after we come in
with a word about coffee.

1217
00:51:48,386 --> 00:51:51,965
Yes, Jearlyn,
nothing stimulates a person...

1218
00:51:52,035 --> 00:51:56,769
keeps you focused quite
like good old caffeine.

1219
00:51:56,834 --> 00:51:57,882
Black coffee.

1220
00:51:57,955 --> 00:52:01,304
Mmm. So good.
I'm glad you like it, too.

1221
00:52:03,202 --> 00:52:04,959

00:52:05,027 --> 00:52:08,190

Whoa!

1237
00:52:49,507 --> 00:52:52,573
Chuck, what you got
goin' in here, huh?

1238
00:52:52,642 --> 00:52:53,985
Huh!

1239
00:52:54,051 --> 00:52:56,385
Candles and music and-

1240
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:59,648
Hey, hey, wake up, buddy.

00:54:17,509 --> 00:54:18,588

It's OK.
It's OK. It's OK.

1263
00:54:28,451 --> 00:54:30,721
But how can he be dead?

1264
00:54:30,788 --> 00:54:32,414
He just went away, that's all.

1265
00:54:32,484 --> 00:54:35,614
Oh, my Chuck.

1266
00:54:35,684 --> 00:54:37,113

00:54:37,187 --> 00:54:39,904

is not a tragedy.

with more right after this.

1289
00:55:50,438 --> 00:55:53,536
Ladies and gentlemen, we are now
at nine minutes to broadcast, please.

1290
00:55:53,605 --> 00:55:54,651
Nine minutes.

1291
00:55:55,845 --> 00:55:57,885
Hey. No smokin', mister.

1292
00:55:59,525 --> 00:56:02,688
Chuck Akers is dead.
He's gone.

1293
00:56:03,749 --> 00:56:07,546
I don't follow your reasoning there.

1294
00:56:07,622 --> 00:56:09,727
I said Chuck is dead.

1295
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:12,609
Who's dead?

1296
00:56:12,676 --> 00:56:13,919
Chuck.

1297
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:16,861
When?

1298
00:56:16,933 --> 00:56:18,558
Now.

1299
00:56:18,629 --> 00:56:20,189
He just died now?

1300
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:21,689
I don't know when the hell he died.

1301
00:56:21,765 --> 00:56:24,154
I wasn't there.

1302
00:56:24,229 --> 00:56:26,171
What was the approximate
time of death?

1303
00:56:26,245 --> 00:56:28,733
Recent. Why don't you go
check it out for yourself.

1304
00:56:28,805 --> 00:56:30,049
He's in there.

1305
00:56:31,396 --> 00:56:33,950
Does anyone else know about this?

1306
00:56:34,021 --> 00:56:35,777
I have no idea.

1307
00:56:35,845 --> 00:56:37,787
Because if anyone else knows about this
and they're not saying anything...

1308
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:38,973
I need to know about that.

1309
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:47,357
Excuse me.

1310
00:56:55,077 --> 00:56:56,637
I used to listen to your show...

1311
00:56:58,437 --> 00:56:59,998
until I died.

1312
00:57:02,277 --> 00:57:04,164
My name was Lois Peterson.

1313
00:57:07,205 --> 00:57:08,994
I was driving up to this cabin up north...

1314
00:57:09,062 --> 00:57:12,575
and you were telling a story
and I was laughing.

1315
00:57:14,149 --> 00:57:17,858
And then the car skidded off the road
and into a ditch and it flipped.

1316
00:57:17,924 --> 00:57:20,893
And as it did, the thought occurred to me...

1317
00:57:20,966 --> 00:57:24,894
that the story just wasn't that funny.

1318
00:57:27,717 --> 00:57:29,604
And then...

1319
00:57:29,669 --> 00:57:36,510
I was standing in this tall grass
looking down at my own body.

1320
00:57:36,582 --> 00:57:37,628
Hmm.

1321
00:57:37,701 --> 00:57:39,425
So sorry.

1322
00:57:41,317 --> 00:57:44,666
I was on my way to that cabin
to meet my lover Larry.

1323
00:57:44,741 --> 00:57:49,443
We had been planning it
for over two months.

1324
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:56,863
And because of your story,
I lost control and I died.

1325
00:57:56,934 --> 00:57:58,973
- So...
- I'm so sorry.

1326
00:57:59,045 --> 00:58:01,599
So you killed me, in a way.

1327
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:03,043
Isn't that interesting?

1328
00:58:04,196 --> 00:58:07,231
He's quite dead.

1329
00:58:07,302 --> 00:58:08,676
Just a half an hour ago
he was walkin' around...

1330
00:58:08,742 --> 00:58:11,556
exchangin' the gases
with the atmosphere.

1331
00:58:11,622 --> 00:58:13,411
Well, there's a lot more
out than in now.

1332
00:58:13,478 --> 00:58:14,787
We should call the cops.

1333
00:58:14,853 --> 00:58:15,900
No.

1334
00:58:15,973 --> 00:58:18,592
When the time is right,
I'll make the call.

1335
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:19,708
You... just, um-

1336
00:58:19,781 --> 00:58:22,368
All right. We're at five minutes
from broadcast.

1337
00:58:22,438 --> 00:58:23,812
Don't talk about this to anyone.
All right?

1338
00:58:23,878 --> 00:58:25,601
Keep it under your hat.

1339
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:26,717
Go about your business.

1340
00:58:30,917 --> 00:58:32,444
I'm gonna secure the area.

1341
00:58:32,518 --> 00:58:34,623
Let's get on with the show.

1342
00:58:34,694 --> 00:58:36,799
You gonna be all right?

1343
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:38,114
Yeah, I'll be all right.

1344
00:58:41,894 --> 00:58:43,748
So you're really an angel?

1345
00:58:43,813 --> 00:58:45,188
Of course.

1346
00:58:45,254 --> 00:58:46,781
Hmm.

1347
00:58:46,854 --> 00:58:48,262
What do you do?

1348
00:58:48,326 --> 00:58:49,374
Well, that's a dumb question.

1349
00:58:49,447 --> 00:58:51,421
No, no. I-uh, I do lots of things.

1350
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:55,837
I comfort people that are desperately sad.

1351
00:58:55,911 --> 00:58:58,212
And I make personal appearances.

1352
00:58:58,279 --> 00:59:00,416
I-

1353
00:59:00,485 --> 00:59:02,941
Tears on a statue.

1354
00:59:03,014 --> 00:59:07,237
One time I put the face of the Lord
on a bowl of oatmeal.

1355
00:59:07,302 --> 00:59:08,447
Just to cheer people up.

1356
00:59:08,518 --> 00:59:11,136
You know, those kind of things.

1357
00:59:11,207 --> 00:59:14,370
But mostly I-I take people up to see God.

1358
00:59:14,438 --> 00:59:15,900
That's why I'm here.

1359
00:59:15,974 --> 00:59:20,448
But I-I just keep thinking
about that story...

1360
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:24,130
and why it was funny.

1361
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:26,108
The story I told on the radio?

1362
00:59:26,183 --> 00:59:27,873
It was about penguins.

1363
00:59:27,942 --> 00:59:29,666
Oh. The penguin joke.

1364
00:59:31,718 --> 00:59:33,790
Two penguins standing on an ice floe.

1365
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:34,910
That's the one.

1366
00:59:34,983 --> 00:59:37,024
And the first penguin says...

1367
00:59:37,096 --> 00:59:39,266
"You look like
you're wearing a tuxedo. "

1368
00:59:40,584 --> 00:59:42,143
And the second penguin says...

1369
00:59:42,214 --> 00:59:43,775
"What makes you think I'm not?"

1370
00:59:47,207 --> 00:59:48,734
- Is there more?
- No.

1371
00:59:48,806 --> 00:59:50,050
- That's the joke?
- Mm-hmm.

1372
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:51,296
Why is that funny?

1373
00:59:52,487 --> 00:59:54,722
I guess it's funny
because people laugh at it.

1374
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:58,053
I'm not laughing.

1375
00:59:58,119 --> 01:00:03,170
You're an angel.

1376
01:00:03,238 --> 01:00:05,660
G.K. to the stage, please.
G.K. to the stage, please.

1377
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:06,782
I should probably go.

1378
01:00:06,855 --> 01:00:09,539
Oh yes, of course.
I didn't come for you.

1379
01:00:09,607 --> 01:00:12,541
Oh. OK. All right.

1380
01:00:12,615 --> 01:00:13,663
I think they're waiting for me.

1381
01:00:13,736 --> 01:00:17,314
Oh-what did the second penguin say?

1382
01:00:17,383 --> 01:00:22,597
The second penguin said,
"What makes you think I'm not?" OK?

1383
01:00:22,663 --> 01:00:24,387
- OK.
- All right. See you.

1384
01:00:25,799 --> 01:00:27,360
Take your time.

1385
01:00:27,432 --> 01:00:29,470
Thanks.

1386
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:33,634
Two minutes from broadcast.
Two minutes, please.

1387
01:00:33,703 --> 01:00:35,644
Ahem. Ahem. Ahem.

1388
01:00:35,718 --> 01:00:36,766
Could I have a word with you?

1389
01:00:38,023 --> 01:00:42,179
Uh, we have a situation here,
um, which we are monitoring...

1390
01:00:42,247 --> 01:00:44,581
but I wanted you to be apprised of it.

1391
01:00:46,087 --> 01:00:47,843
You mean the woman
in the white trench coat?

1392
01:00:47,911 --> 01:00:49,504
No, there's a woman in a w-

1393
01:00:49,575 --> 01:00:51,549
a white trench coat, yes.
You saw her?

1394
01:00:51,623 --> 01:00:53,478
- I saw her over here.
- You spoke to her?

1395
01:00:53,544 --> 01:00:55,037
You-no, you were talking to her.

1396
01:00:55,111 --> 01:00:56,159
You saw that?

1397
01:00:56,232 --> 01:00:57,639
Yeah. You.

1398
01:00:57,703 --> 01:01:00,638
Well, if you see her in the audience,
I need you to give me a high sign.

1399
01:01:00,712 --> 01:01:02,566
Just use-give me a signal
with your hand.

1400
01:01:02,631 --> 01:01:04,770
Do, uh...

1401
01:01:04,839 --> 01:01:05,887
No. Here, do it behind your back.

1402
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:08,228
- Just-just-just wiggle.
- Rabbit tail?

1403
01:01:08,295 --> 01:01:11,874
Yeah, and give me a verbal, uh, sign,
some-something in code.

1404
01:01:11,944 --> 01:01:13,373
Just say, uh, indemnity.

1405
01:01:13,448 --> 01:01:14,658
- Indemnity. Yeah.
- OK.

1406
01:01:14,726 --> 01:01:16,669
Or no. Granite Falls.

1407
01:01:16,744 --> 01:01:18,566
OK. How does that-

1408
01:01:18,631 --> 01:01:19,940
How does that go?
Granite Falls?

1409
01:01:20,007 --> 01:01:21,916
Well, you just say, uh,
then we would like to do a song now...

1410
01:01:21,991 --> 01:01:24,358
for our dear friends in...

1411
01:01:24,424 --> 01:01:25,471
Granite Falls.

1412
01:01:25,543 --> 01:01:26,721
OK. All right. OK.

1413
01:01:26,792 --> 01:01:30,567
And then if I miss that,
uh, this'll be a cue for Rich...

1414
01:01:30,632 --> 01:01:32,934
to do a-a musical turn.

1415
01:01:36,649 --> 01:01:38,371
- That's the code.
- Code?

1416
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,261
Then I'll get it. OK?

1417
01:01:40,328 --> 01:01:42,401
That's how I got into radio, actually.

1418
01:01:42,472 --> 01:01:43,399
Morse code.

1419
01:01:43,464 --> 01:01:46,181
I was a deckhand on a-on a boat.

1420
01:01:46,248 --> 01:01:47,841
Big storm. November.

1421
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:49,221
I'll never forget it.

1422
01:01:49,287 --> 01:01:50,400
You got on the ship radio...

1423
01:01:50,472 --> 01:01:52,839
and you told jokes
and you sang for two hours...

1424
01:01:52,904 --> 01:01:53,886
until the ship came in safely to port.

1425
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,132
Right.
I told you that story?

1426
01:01:56,201 --> 01:01:57,127
Granite Falls.

1427
01:01:57,192 --> 01:01:58,272
- G.K.?
- Granite Falls. Right.

1428
01:01:58,344 --> 01:01:59,358
Yeah?

1429
01:01:59,432 --> 01:02:02,051
- If you see G.K. do that behind his back...
- Fifteen seconds.

1430
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:03,047
it's your cue to go like this.

1431
01:02:05,159 --> 01:02:07,046
So what are you gonna do
for work after this?

1432
01:02:07,112 --> 01:02:08,573
I don't know.
I'll find a job somewhere.

1433
01:02:09,672 --> 01:02:10,981
Like where?

1434
01:02:11,048 --> 01:02:14,244
A job where I never have to say a word.

1435
01:02:14,311 --> 01:02:15,457
Why?

1436
01:02:15,528 --> 01:02:17,600
That's why. Right there.

1437
01:02:17,672 --> 01:02:18,599
What are you gonna do?

1438
01:02:18,663 --> 01:02:20,158
Like be an underwear model
or something?

1439
01:02:20,232 --> 01:02:21,345
If they ask, sure.

1440
01:02:21,417 --> 01:02:23,271
- You're on.
- Yes.

1441
01:02:26,536 --> 01:02:28,958
<i>And we're back with more of
A Prairie Home Companion...</i>

1442

brought to you by the Federation
of Associated Organizations.

1443
01:02:33,193 --> 01:02:36,575
Somewhere there's an organization
just for you.

1444
01:02:36,648 --> 01:02:37,760
And brought to you by Fred Farrell...

1445
01:02:37,832 --> 01:02:39,043
the name you've gradually come
to trust...

1446
01:02:39,112 --> 01:02:41,600
when it comes
to animal nuisance control.

1447
01:02:41,673 --> 01:02:42,884
The Johnson Girls coming up...

1448
01:02:42,953 --> 01:02:46,083
and the old trail hands,
Dusty and Lefty are with us...

1449
01:02:46,153 --> 01:02:47,527
and our good friend Jearlyn Steele.

1450
01:02:47,593 --> 01:02:48,966

Oh.

I am the angel Asphodel.

1464
01:03:43,114 --> 01:03:44,488

you be an angel.

1466

I say spread your wings and fly.

1468
01:03:52,904 --> 01:03:54,432
This is a revelation.

1469
01:03:56,233 --> 01:03:58,241
For the both of us.

1470
01:03:58,314 --> 01:04:00,550
Listen, if you're an angel, I, uh...

1471
01:04:00,617 --> 01:04:01,926
I wonder if...

1472
01:04:01,993 --> 01:04:04,611
you and me were to, uh...

feel anything?

1476
01:04:11,242 --> 01:04:13,096

The show's been going on how long?

1522
01:06:34,314 --> 01:06:35,775
Somebody said fifty years.

1523
01:06:35,850 --> 01:06:38,785
N- nearly. Uh, thirty... something.

1524
01:06:38,858 --> 01:06:40,647
Weird. It's like a time warp.

1525
01:06:40,715 --> 01:06:41,991
I feel like an anthropologist...

1526
01:06:42,059 --> 01:06:45,473
finding some primitive tribe
squatting around a fire in the forest...

1527
01:06:45,546 --> 01:06:47,783
telling stories,
sparks flying up in the air.

1528
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:49,029
Yeah. Heh heh.

1529
01:06:49,099 --> 01:06:52,033
Well, we've got the, uh, luxury box
for you, right here.

1530
01:06:53,547 --> 01:06:54,627
Right this way.

1531
01:06:57,674 --> 01:06:59,747
Who's that guy?

1532
01:06:59,819 --> 01:07:02,983
Oh, that's the guy, uh,
used to come see the shows here.

1533
01:07:03,051 --> 01:07:05,288
Um, local boy.
He's a writer.

1534
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:07,242
Uh, he wrote novels.

1535
01:07:07,306 --> 01:07:08,419
Uh, F. Scott Fitzgerald.

1536
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:09,735
Grew up right here in St. Paul.

1537
01:07:09,803 --> 01:07:10,785
What kind of novels?

1538
01:07:11,787 --> 01:07:13,249
Uh, romantic ones.

1539
01:07:13,323 --> 01:07:14,250
- Oh.
- Mostly.

1540
01:07:14,315 --> 01:07:15,810
I don't read romances. No time.

1541
01:07:15,884 --> 01:07:18,468
Hmm. We usually have,
uh, clients in here.

1542
01:07:18,538 --> 01:07:20,327
You know, five or six of them
at a time, sponsors-

1543
01:07:20,394 --> 01:07:22,566
That's some nice plaster work
around the proscenium there.

1544
01:07:22,635 --> 01:07:24,009
We'll have to remember
to save a piece of that.

1545
01:07:24,075 --> 01:07:25,668
I wish we were taping this show.

1546
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:27,562
This is a live show.

1547
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:29,482
Videotape.
Historical purposes.

1548
01:07:29,547 --> 01:07:31,041
Send it to a museum.

1549
01:07:31,114 --> 01:07:32,489
Well, this is just great.
This is all I need.

1550
01:07:32,555 --> 01:07:34,562
This is the first time
somebody died at the show.

1551
01:07:34,635 --> 01:07:36,643
- I mean, the first time!
- Al, we're all gettin' older.

1552
01:07:36,715 --> 01:07:37,642
He's dead?!

1553
01:07:37,707 --> 01:07:38,984
The show's not over, is it?

1554
01:07:39,051 --> 01:07:41,026
We've got a dead man downstairs.

1555
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,147
We've gotta do something.

1556
01:07:42,219 --> 01:07:43,843
Just be glad-glad you
don't have him onstage.

1557
01:07:43,914 --> 01:07:45,770
- When did this happen?
- Who's that, Chuck?

1558
01:07:45,835 --> 01:07:47,112
- Yes.
- Where's Evelyn?

1559
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:48,161
Evelyn was down there.

1560
01:07:48,235 --> 01:07:50,504
He was waitin' for Evelyn
when he passed away.

1561
01:07:50,571 --> 01:07:52,775
He died with a heart full of hope.

1562
01:07:52,844 --> 01:07:55,331
Yeah, that's not a bad way to go
when you think about it.

1563
01:07:55,403 --> 01:07:57,890
Sittin' there in the dark,
in your underwear, you know?

1564
01:07:57,963 --> 01:07:59,305
Waitin' for your lover to come.

1565
01:07:59,371 --> 01:08:00,865
He was in his underwear?

1566
01:08:00,939 --> 01:08:04,169
Donna told me he was wearin'
boxer shorts with big raspberries on 'em...

1567
01:08:04,236 --> 01:08:07,366
and a great big bottle of massage oil
and a bayberry candle goin'...

1568
01:08:07,435 --> 01:08:09,409
<i>and Mills Brothers' Greatest Hits.</i>

1569
01:08:09,483 --> 01:08:12,036
He was all set.
He was loaded for Evelyn.

1570
01:08:12,108 --> 01:08:14,246
Well, uh, can I offer you
somethin' to drink?

1571
01:08:14,314 --> 01:08:15,722
Water. No ice. No lemon.

1572
01:08:17,899 --> 01:08:19,525
Water. No ice. No lemon.

1573
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:20,970
Straight up. Neat.

1574
01:08:22,475 --> 01:08:25,858
Radio sound effects
learned from a master.

1575
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:27,273
What can I tell you about the show?

1576
01:08:27,339 --> 01:08:29,128
I know everything I need
to know about the show.

1577
01:08:30,219 --> 01:08:32,073
- You're sure about that?
- Yes.

1578
01:08:32,139 --> 01:08:33,416
You're not gonna change your mind?

1579
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:34,793
Ahh! No.

1580
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:35,940
Hmm.

1581
01:08:36,012 --> 01:08:37,767
Lot of good people up there.

1582
01:08:37,835 --> 01:08:38,850
On the stage.

1583
01:08:38,923 --> 01:08:39,850
Lot of 'em.

1584
01:08:41,131 --> 01:08:43,335
I mean, I'm a man
of the world like yourself...

1585
01:08:43,402 --> 01:08:44,865
but, uh, these folks
put their lives into this.

1586
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:46,947
Now they can put their lives
into something else.

1587
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:48,678
There's always something
to put your life into, isn't there?

1588
01:08:48,748 --> 01:08:50,089
It's like the Scripture tells us...

1589
01:08:50,155 --> 01:08:52,011
you have to lose your life
before you can...

1590
01:08:52,076 --> 01:08:53,155
find it.

1591
01:08:54,156 --> 01:08:56,327
Scripture is guiding you here?

1592
01:08:56,395 --> 01:08:58,632
The company is owned
by people of faith, Mr. Noir.

1593
01:09:00,076 --> 01:09:03,971
Ahh. Before I came to the Lord,
I played in a band myself.

1594
01:09:04,043 --> 01:09:05,931
The Dukes of Rhythm.
Ha ha.

1595
01:09:05,996 --> 01:09:07,784
We were terrible.

1596
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:10,983
Then, thank God, we were saved by
the simple realization of the truth.

1597
01:09:11,115 --> 01:09:12,642
We were no good.
We got fired.

1598
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:14,438
It was a blessing.

1599
01:09:14,507 --> 01:09:15,436
You wanna say something?

1600
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:16,906
Say what?
No, I don't want to say-

1601
01:09:16,971 --> 01:09:17,900
You know, you should say somethin'...

1602
01:09:17,963 --> 01:09:19,906
'cause he was on the show
all these years.

1603
01:09:19,981 --> 01:09:20,908
Absolutely.

1604
01:09:20,972 --> 01:09:22,826
I don't do eulogies. I don't.

1605
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:24,964
Is there a reason for that?
Or you just don't care for people?

1606
01:09:25,036 --> 01:09:26,563
I'm at an age where
if I started to do them...

1607
01:09:26,636 --> 01:09:28,294
I'd do nothing but eulogies.

1608
01:09:28,364 --> 01:09:29,924
How about just
a moment of silence?

1609
01:09:29,995 --> 01:09:32,384
Silence on the radio?
I don't know how that works.

1610
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:33,769
Garrison, OK, thank you.

1611
01:09:33,835 --> 01:09:35,080
OK, we've got about thirty seconds.
Thirty seconds.

1612
01:09:35,148 --> 01:09:36,806
Hold on a second.
You're saying if my mom died...

1613
01:09:36,876 --> 01:09:38,731
you wouldn't do anything,
you wouldn't say anything.

1614
01:09:38,796 --> 01:09:39,723
If I what?

1615
01:09:39,788 --> 01:09:42,277
You'd just ignore it,
you'd act like it never happened?

1616
01:09:42,348 --> 01:09:43,276
How could you do that?

1617
01:09:43,341 --> 01:09:44,518
We don't look back in radio.

1618
01:09:44,589 --> 01:09:45,734
That's the beauty of it.

1619
01:09:45,803 --> 01:09:47,429
Nobody gets old.
Nobody dies.

1620
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,061
We just keep on goin'.

1621
01:09:49,133 --> 01:09:50,060
What if you died?

1622
01:09:50,124 --> 01:09:51,433
I will.

1623
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:52,809
You don't want people
to remember you?

1624
01:09:52,877 --> 01:09:55,560
I don't want them to be told
to remember me.

1625
01:09:55,628 --> 01:09:57,602
Hmm?

1626
01:09:57,676 --> 01:09:59,619
You know what?
Somebody died down there.

1627
01:09:59,693 --> 01:10:00,642
That's right.

1628
01:10:00,717 --> 01:10:01,960
OK? And we're not
even paying attention...

1629
01:10:02,028 --> 01:10:03,369
and you're not even
gonna say anything?

1630
01:10:03,436 --> 01:10:04,843
We pay attention by doin' our job.

1631
01:10:04,907 --> 01:10:07,329
Go, go, go.
You're on, you're on, you're on.

1632
01:10:07,404 --> 01:10:09,192
I gotta get someone
to take me home.

1633
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:11,016
I'm not spendin' the night
alone tonight.

1634
01:10:11,084 --> 01:10:13,091
Don't-nobody even cares.

1635
01:10:13,164 --> 01:10:14,887
No, we do.
We all care.

1636
01:10:14,956 --> 01:10:16,299
We care like hell.

1637
01:10:16,364 --> 01:10:17,292
You're gonna want to have...

1638
01:10:17,356 --> 01:10:19,691
a whole freezer full
of Prince of Pizzas.

1639
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:23,204
It's the frozen pizza that
tastes homemade always.

1640
01:10:23,276 --> 01:10:27,106
Made from real Minnesota
cheese and sausage.

1641
01:10:28,236 --> 01:10:30,725
§ One Prince of Pizza slice §

1642
01:10:30,797 --> 01:10:32,968
§ Puts me in paradise §

1643
01:10:33,037 --> 01:10:35,525
§ Sausage and extra cheese §

1644
01:10:35,597 --> 01:10:38,149
§ Onions and anchovies §

1645
01:10:39,181 --> 01:10:40,293
That's fun-that's funny.

1646
01:10:40,365 --> 01:10:42,820
Watching them through this glass,
it's like a zoo.

1647
01:10:44,845 --> 01:10:48,008
- Ahh.
- I'll be right back.

1648
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:49,506
§ It's the best §

1649
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:50,759
§ It's the best §

1650
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:53,099
§ In the Midwest §

1651
01:10:53,164 --> 01:10:55,752

1652
01:10:55,821 --> 01:10:59,530
§ Prince of Pizza is the best pie §

1653
01:11:05,421 --> 01:11:06,730
Yes, Guy Noir here.

1654
01:11:06,797 --> 01:11:07,845
Get me Molly.

1655
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:11,650
Yeah?

1656
01:11:11,725 --> 01:11:14,572
Molly, listen, I need you to do something
for me. It's very important.

1657
01:11:14,636 --> 01:11:15,564
What?

1658
01:11:15,629 --> 01:11:17,833
I need you come out here
so I can talk to you face to face.

1659
01:11:17,901 --> 01:11:19,757
- Can you do that?
- I'm right here.

1660
01:11:19,822 --> 01:11:22,471
Wha-b-d-

1661
01:11:22,541 --> 01:11:24,875
- Who's this?
- I don't know.

1662
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:27,144
No, who-
who's talking to me?

1663
01:11:27,212 --> 01:11:28,160
I don't-I-I am!

1664
01:11:28,236 --> 01:11:29,666
Shh! Hello?

1665
01:11:29,741 --> 01:11:32,618
Hello?

1666
01:11:33,996 --> 01:11:35,558
There's nobody there.

1667
01:11:35,630 --> 01:11:37,288
OK.

1668
01:11:37,357 --> 01:11:39,691
I have to ask you
to do something for me.

1669
01:11:39,756 --> 01:11:40,685
It's very important.

1670
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:42,178
- It's, uh...
- What?

1671
01:11:43,278 --> 01:11:45,188
I need a drink.

1672
01:11:45,262 --> 01:11:46,668
Uhh!

1673
01:11:46,733 --> 01:11:47,748
Oh, je-

1674
01:11:49,645 --> 01:11:50,758
You OK?

1675
01:11:53,229 --> 01:11:54,157
Yeah.

1676
01:11:54,221 --> 01:11:57,964
So how's it goin' in there
with, uh, axeman?

1677
01:11:58,958 --> 01:12:00,070
Very slippery.

1678
01:12:00,142 --> 01:12:01,418
How do they keep
the drinks on there?

1679
01:12:01,485 --> 01:12:02,468
It's going very well.

1680
01:12:02,542 --> 01:12:04,483
I mean, well, he's tough.
He's tough.

1681
01:12:04,557 --> 01:12:09,314
But, uh, I think, uh,
I think I have another solution.

1682
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:10,317
What?

1683
01:12:10,382 --> 01:12:11,942
Well, he used to be in a band.

1684
01:12:12,014 --> 01:12:13,923
A long time ago
called the Dukes of Rhythm...

1685
01:12:13,998 --> 01:12:16,300
and I think if we can round up
the guys who were in that band...

1686
01:12:16,366 --> 01:12:18,275
and get 'em all on the show...

1687
01:12:18,349 --> 01:12:19,844
Sorry.

1688
01:12:19,918 --> 01:12:24,489
Um, we can, um, we can maybe
get him to change his mind.

1689
01:12:24,558 --> 01:12:29,545
Have a kind of reunion, you know,
with all the, uh, band members...

1690
01:12:29,613 --> 01:12:30,595
<i>right here on
The Prairie Home Companion.</i>

1691
01:12:31,631 --> 01:12:32,557
Here's to happy endings.

1692
01:12:32,622 --> 01:12:34,051
Happy endings!

1693
01:12:36,974 --> 01:12:39,885
Ahh!

1694
01:12:39,950 --> 01:12:41,030
Oh, God, that's good.

1695
01:12:41,102 --> 01:12:42,247
Mother's milk.

1696
01:12:42,318 --> 01:12:44,587
- What?
- Sorry.

1697
01:12:44,654 --> 01:12:46,564
Here's what I need you to do.

1698
01:12:46,638 --> 01:12:48,493
- Hmm.
- Take this note-

1699
01:12:48,558 --> 01:12:50,630
uhh, to the woman...

1700
01:12:50,702 --> 01:12:52,043
backstage...

1701
01:12:52,109 --> 01:12:53,319
Give it to who?

1702
01:12:53,389 --> 01:12:54,372
The lady backstage.

1703
01:12:54,446 --> 01:12:55,853
The blonde lady
with a white trench coat.

1704
01:12:55,918 --> 01:12:56,966
Blonde lady with
a white trench coat?

1705
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:58,860
Yes. She's beautiful, blonde.

1706
01:12:58,926 --> 01:13:00,868
Ahh, ahh...

1707
01:13:00,942 --> 01:13:01,956
You can't miss her.

1708
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:04,005
"Angel, man in the-"

1709
01:13:04,078 --> 01:13:06,085
Shh!

1710
01:13:06,158 --> 01:13:07,467
Boat?

1711
01:13:07,534 --> 01:13:08,614
Booth.

1712
01:13:08,686 --> 01:13:10,508
"Man in the booth...

1713
01:13:10,574 --> 01:13:14,437
Make him go away. "

1714
01:13:15,598 --> 01:13:18,980
Give this to her,
and then destroy that.

1715
01:13:20,397 --> 01:13:23,496
<i>It's time to bring out an old favorite
here on A Prairie Home Companion...</i>

1716
01:13:23,567 --> 01:13:26,250
And that's two fine women
who've been singing together...

1717
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:30,092
since they were little girls
growing up in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.

1718
01:13:30,157 --> 01:13:32,328
They've kept alive all those old songs
that go way back.

1719
01:13:32,398 --> 01:13:36,042
Please welcome here the Johnson Girls,
Rhonda and Yolanda.

1720
01:13:36,109 --> 01:13:38,892
Ha ha ha ha.

1721
01:13:38,959 --> 01:13:40,420
Thank you.

1722
01:13:40,494 --> 01:13:42,861
Thank you very much.

1723
01:13:42,926 --> 01:13:46,406
We're gonna do a song now
that we wrote for our mama.

1724
01:13:46,478 --> 01:13:48,682
Who brought us up...

1725

01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:08,331
Yeah? Go ahead.

1900
01:21:08,403 --> 01:21:10,442
Why do they call it PMS?

1901
01:21:10,514 --> 01:21:12,619
PMS? Why, I don't know. Why?

1902
01:21:12,691 --> 01:21:15,341
'Cause Mad Cow was already taken.

1903
01:21:16,563 --> 01:21:17,937
All right, that's enough.

1904
01:21:18,003 --> 01:21:20,720
Ha ha ha!

1905
01:21:20,786 --> 01:21:22,281
Hey, Dusty.

1906
01:21:22,355 --> 01:21:23,282
Yeah, Lefty?

1907
01:21:23,346 --> 01:21:27,437
What do you get when you cross
holy water with castor oil?

1908
01:21:27,506 --> 01:21:29,416
I don't know, Lefty.
What do you get?

1909
01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:31,312
A religious movement.

1910
01:21:32,658 --> 01:21:34,088
Ha ha ha ha!

1911
01:21:34,163 --> 01:21:38,985
Hey, uh... hey, Lefty, what did
the elephant say to the naked man?

1912
01:21:39,058 --> 01:21:40,107
What'd he say?

1913
01:21:40,179 --> 01:21:42,666
It's cute, but can you really
breathe through that thing?

1914
01:21:43,698 --> 01:21:44,626
Come on, now.

Thank you!

1931
01:22:14,836 --> 01:22:15,850
Whoo-hoo!

1932
01:22:18,899 --> 01:22:20,329
We hope you've enjoyed
our show tonight.

1933
01:22:20,404 --> 01:22:22,258
We certainly have enjoyed
having you with us.

1934
01:22:22,323 --> 01:22:24,363
Great God in heaven.
Holy shit.

1935
01:22:24,435 --> 01:22:26,093
We've got six minutes left!
How did that happen?

1936
01:22:26,163 --> 01:22:27,570
Look, have you got
anything for six minutes?

1937
01:22:27,636 --> 01:22:28,945
Have you rehearsed anything?
Anything? Anything?

1938
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:29,939
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

1939
01:22:30,004 --> 01:22:33,997
Darlin', remember I said to you,
one door closes, another one opens?

1940
01:22:34,067 --> 01:22:34,994
You go downstairs.

1941
01:22:35,059 --> 01:22:36,914
Get your music
and come up and sing.

1942
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:39,052
- Now?
- Lola, go, go, go.

1943
01:22:39,123 --> 01:22:40,300
You can do it.

1944
01:22:40,371 --> 01:22:41,582
He said, go! Go!

1945
01:22:41,652 --> 01:22:42,578
Before he gets done.

1946
01:22:42,644 --> 01:22:44,978
That gives shy persons
the strength to get up...

1947
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:47,050
and do what needs to be done.

1948
01:23:41,492 --> 01:23:44,787
So, we'll look forward to seeing you
back here at the Fitzgerald Theater...

1949
01:23:44,851 --> 01:23:46,061
next week at this same time.

1950
01:23:46,131 --> 01:23:48,433
Brought to you once again
by your friends at Powdermilk Biscuits.

1951
01:23:48,499 --> 01:23:50,441
Six minutes.
Lola's gonna sing a song.

1952
01:23:50,515 --> 01:23:52,206
Your barn doors are open.

1953
01:23:52,276 --> 01:23:55,146
But first, we're going to bring
a young woman on...

1954
01:23:55,220 --> 01:23:58,122
to make her debut on our show.

1955
01:23:58,196 --> 01:24:01,425
Let's bring out this young
and very talented...

1956
01:24:01,492 --> 01:24:04,656
young woman who knows
all those good old songs...

1957
01:24:04,724 --> 01:24:06,960
to make her
very first performance...

1958
01:24:07,029 --> 01:24:09,036
right here on our radio show.

1959
01:24:09,108 --> 01:24:14,193
Please welcome now
the beautiful young Miss Lola Johnson.

1960
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:15,339
Lola Johnson.

1961
01:24:15,412 --> 01:24:16,907
Ladies and gentlemen.

1962
01:24:26,388 --> 01:24:29,617
§ Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts §

1963
01:24:29,684 --> 01:24:32,499
§ But he was doin' her wrong §

1964
01:24:32,563 --> 01:24:35,859
§ He was doin' her wrong
in a bad way §

1965
01:24:35,925 --> 01:24:38,096
§ But she was good and strong §

1966
01:24:38,164 --> 01:24:41,328
§ He was her man §

1967
01:24:41,396 --> 01:24:43,404
§ But he was a jerk §

1968
01:24:43,476 --> 01:24:44,937
Is that the way this song goes?

1969
01:24:45,012 --> 01:24:46,573
Um, sort of.

1970
01:24:46,645 --> 01:24:48,586
§ He was in a hotel with Nelly Bly §

1971
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:52,523
§ And the gun went rooty-toot-toot §

1972
01:24:52,597 --> 01:24:55,411
§ She shot the bastard in the heart §

1973
01:24:55,477 --> 01:24:57,452
§ And ruined his nice suit §

1974
01:24:57,525 --> 01:25:00,786
§ He was her man §

1975
01:25:00,852 --> 01:25:03,024
§ But he was no damn good §

1976
01:25:05,173 --> 01:25:08,555
§ So, they took him
up to the graveyard §

1977
01:25:08,628 --> 01:25:12,206
§ And stuck him in the dirt §

1978
01:25:12,276 --> 01:25:14,895
§ Which was oh, so very sad §

1979
01:25:14,965 --> 01:25:17,299
§ And the waste of a nice clean shirt §

1980
01:25:17,365 --> 01:25:20,399
§ He was her man §

1981
01:25:20,469 --> 01:25:23,315
§ But he was doin' her wrong §

1982
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:24,363
What's the next line?

1983
01:25:24,437 --> 01:25:27,853
I've no idea. I don't know.

1984
01:25:27,925 --> 01:25:31,089
§ He had no idea what happened §

1985
01:25:31,157 --> 01:25:34,605
§ He was wavin' hello to God §

1986
01:25:34,677 --> 01:25:37,327
§ He died from eatin' squirrels §

1987
01:25:37,396 --> 01:25:40,147
§ And they laid him in the sod §

1988
01:25:40,213 --> 01:25:43,311
§ He was her man §

1989
01:25:43,381 --> 01:25:45,388
§ And he was doin' her wrong §

1990
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:47,566
Cool song.
Wrap it up.

1991
01:25:47,636 --> 01:25:50,833
§ So that was Frankie and Johnny §

1992
01:25:50,901 --> 01:25:54,196
§ And that's the end of my song §

1993
01:25:54,261 --> 01:25:57,490
§ She put a hose in his tailpipe §

1994
01:25:57,557 --> 01:25:59,728
§ 'Cause he had done her wrong §

1995
01:25:59,797 --> 01:26:02,667
§ He was her man §

1996
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:08,686
§ And that's all she wrote §

1997
01:26:09,716 --> 01:26:11,146
Thank you.

1998
01:26:11,285 --> 01:26:13,903
Ha ha ha!

1999
01:26:13,973 --> 01:26:16,340
There's a young woman
who's going a long way.

2000
01:26:16,406 --> 01:26:17,965
We're going, too.
We're out of here,

2001
01:26:18,037 --> 01:26:19,281
And that's our show.

2002
01:26:19,637 --> 01:26:21,392
Remember to keep
your feet on the ground...

2003
01:26:21,461 --> 01:26:22,987
your hopes up high...

2004
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:25,264
pray for rain,
keep the humor dry...

2005
01:26:25,333 --> 01:26:27,722
and eat those Powdermilk Biscuits.

2006
01:26:27,798 --> 01:26:29,521
Thank you, everybody.

2007
01:26:29,589 --> 01:26:37,172
§ Come and sit by my side
if you love me §

2008
01:26:37,238 --> 01:26:44,558
§ Do not hasten to bid me adieu §

2009
01:26:44,628 --> 01:26:52,267
§ But remember the Red River Valley §

2010
01:26:52,342 --> 01:27:00,274
§ And the one
who has loved you so true §

2011
01:27:00,341 --> 01:27:01,421
Show's almost over.

2012
01:27:01,494 --> 01:27:02,836
In more ways than one.

2013
01:27:02,902 --> 01:27:05,390
Nice perfume.
Who are you with? The show?

2014
01:27:05,461 --> 01:27:06,890
In a way.

2015
01:27:06,965 --> 01:27:09,202
I used to listen
to this show every week.

2016
01:27:09,270 --> 01:27:13,906
Hmm. Well, it was great in its time,
but the time's up. Life moves on.

2017
01:27:13,974 --> 01:27:15,403
It does.

2018
01:27:15,478 --> 01:27:17,200
So, be careful driving tonight.

2019
01:27:17,268 --> 01:27:19,244
Need a lift somewhere?

2020
01:27:19,318 --> 01:27:21,870
There's a shortcut to the airport.

2021
01:27:21,941 --> 01:27:26,644
A steep hill followed by a series
of sharp curves and a large oak tree.

2022
01:27:26,710 --> 01:27:28,467
What's your name?

2023
01:27:28,534 --> 01:27:29,461
Asphodel.

2024
01:27:29,526 --> 01:27:31,249
Pretty.
I like your hair that way.

2025
01:27:31,317 --> 01:27:34,187
§ Come and sit by my side... §

2026
01:27:34,262 --> 01:27:35,407
When I used to listen to them...

2027
01:27:35,478 --> 01:27:37,649
it was like they were all
my really good friends.

2028
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:39,343
But something else happened, right?

2029
01:27:39,413 --> 01:27:40,341
Right.

2030
01:27:40,405 --> 01:27:42,381
Well...

2031
01:27:42,454 --> 01:27:46,894
I'm that something else.

2032
01:27:46,966 --> 01:27:54,549
§ But remember
the Red River Valley §

2033
01:28:04,374 --> 01:28:05,748
How long is the ride to the airport?

2034
01:28:05,815 --> 01:28:06,742
Twenty minutes.

2035
01:28:06,807 --> 01:28:09,620
She said there was a shortcut.

2036
01:28:09,686 --> 01:28:10,930
Yes, sir. I know it.

2037
01:28:43,254 --> 01:28:45,906
That was the last we saw of him.

2038
01:28:45,975 --> 01:28:47,949
The car hit a tree and blew up.

2039
01:28:50,102 --> 01:28:53,169
Good-bye, axeman.

2040
01:28:53,239 --> 01:28:57,516
But it didn't change a thing.

2041
01:28:57,591 --> 01:28:58,965
<i>They sang Sweet By and By...</i>

2042
01:28:59,031 --> 01:29:05,359
and the audience filed out
and everybody packed up and left.

2043
01:29:05,431 --> 01:29:06,379
First thing in the morning...

2044
01:29:06,454 --> 01:29:08,690
a truck from the demolition
company pulls up...

2045
01:29:08,759 --> 01:29:13,712
and two guys started drilling
for the explosives.

2046
01:29:13,782 --> 01:29:17,524
Just like ya learned
in eighth grade English.

2047
01:29:17,591 --> 01:29:22,348
§ So gather ye rosebuds while ye may §

2048
01:29:22,423 --> 01:29:28,020

2049
01:29:28,087 --> 01:29:34,164

2052
01:29:52,887 --> 01:29:54,611
Come on, pal.

2053
01:29:54,679 --> 01:29:56,173
Let me buy you a drink.

2054
01:30:01,207 --> 01:30:02,287
Ah!

2055
01:30:18,679 --> 01:30:20,686
Donna, make it three eggs over.

2056
01:30:20,759 --> 01:30:22,615
- No, listen to her.
- I was tellin' you.

2057
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:23,661
What were you saying?

2058
01:30:23,735 --> 01:30:26,005
We are talkin'
about doin' a farewell tour.

2059
01:30:26,072 --> 01:30:27,217
- Yeah.
- Oh, who?

2060
01:30:27,288 --> 01:30:29,229
Oh, the whole gang
from the old radio show.

2061
01:30:29,303 --> 01:30:31,158
- Yeah.
- But the show's been over for years.

2062
01:30:31,223 --> 01:30:32,152
Yeah, I mean-

2063
01:30:32,215 --> 01:30:33,841
So? I always wanted to do
a farewell tour.

2064
01:30:33,912 --> 01:30:35,221
I loved doin' that last show.

2065
01:30:35,287 --> 01:30:38,386
I just want to do one last show
and then another one...

2066
01:30:38,456 --> 01:30:40,180
until I'm in a wheelchair.

2067
01:30:40,248 --> 01:30:42,102
I just want to keep doin' them.

2068
01:30:42,168 --> 01:30:43,956
You know, as long as I can
remember the words.

2069
01:30:44,023 --> 01:30:45,780
There's all sorts of towns
we haven't played.

2070
01:30:45,848 --> 01:30:48,978
I mean, you've got Gooseberry Falls
and Lake Winnebigoshish.

2071
01:30:49,047 --> 01:30:51,896
Up in Lake Winnebigoshish
a lot of people are waitin' to see us.

2072
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:53,007
Well, you-don't count on me.

2073
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:54,192
I got a lot of stuff happening.

2074
01:30:54,264 --> 01:30:55,377
What?

2075
01:30:55,448 --> 01:30:57,553
Oh, things.
Things that are in the works.

2076
01:30:57,624 --> 01:31:00,306
Different deals I'm... working out.

2077
01:31:00,375 --> 01:31:02,164
I'll be in and out of town a lot.

2078
01:31:02,232 --> 01:31:05,014
- Yeah, OK. So, what about you?
- Hey, I'm free.

2079
01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:06,007
- Oh!
- Great!

2080
01:31:06,071 --> 01:31:07,926
- Workin' at the parking ramp.
- The parkin' ramp?

2081
01:31:07,992 --> 01:31:09,846
Yes. It's a good job.
I like it.

2082
01:31:09,911 --> 01:31:10,860
I read a lot of books.

2083
01:31:10,936 --> 01:31:11,863
Make that four eggs.

2084
01:31:11,927 --> 01:31:13,335
Oh, boy.
You're readin' a lot.

2085
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:15,821
- Yeah.
- That's interesting.

2086
01:31:15,959 --> 01:31:17,715
Oh, look at this!
Look who's here!

2087
01:31:17,783 --> 01:31:19,126
Oh, my God, I miss these guys.

2088
01:31:19,192 --> 01:31:20,981
Ha ha ha!

2089
01:31:21,048 --> 01:31:23,983
Look who just blew in
from the old prairie.

2090
01:31:24,056 --> 01:31:27,503
I thought you left town
ahead of the sheriff?

2091
01:31:27,575 --> 01:31:30,194
Well, the woman decided
not to press charges.

2092
01:31:30,264 --> 01:31:32,436
Oh, yeah?
What was the crime? Snorin'?

2093
01:31:32,505 --> 01:31:34,741
Ha ha ha!

2094
01:31:34,808 --> 01:31:36,401
Love.

2095
01:31:36,472 --> 01:31:37,901
We just got back in town...

2096
01:31:37,977 --> 01:31:39,634
from playin' the casinos
in South Dakota.

2097
01:31:39,703 --> 01:31:41,132
Yeah? Playin' what? Pinochle?

2098
01:31:41,208 --> 01:31:42,190
Ha ha ha!

2099
01:31:42,264 --> 01:31:43,606
Playin' our music.

2100
01:31:43,672 --> 01:31:45,712
Hey, we hear you might be
gettin' a tour up.

2101
01:31:45,784 --> 01:31:46,765
Oh, yeah.

2102
01:31:46,839 --> 01:31:48,912
We've added some rope tricks
to the repertoire.

2103
01:31:48,984 --> 01:31:50,894
Flaming lariats.

2104
01:31:50,969 --> 01:31:52,495
It's called "Rings of Fire. "

2105
01:31:52,568 --> 01:31:54,576
Well, you know,
we got a bus with bunk beds...

2106
01:31:54,649 --> 01:31:57,267
and we're goin' back
to playin' churches and schools.

2107
01:31:57,336 --> 01:31:58,262
Look at this.

2108
01:31:58,328 --> 01:32:01,591
She's only been workin' six months
and she's now the manager.

2109
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:03,288
What does she do?

2110
01:32:03,352 --> 01:32:04,913
Um, I have no idea.

2111
01:32:04,985 --> 01:32:07,254
- Somethin' religious?
- Software.

2112
01:32:07,321 --> 01:32:09,742
Oh, it's big.
It's movin' like monkeys.

2113
01:32:09,815 --> 01:32:11,310
Hi.

2114
01:32:11,384 --> 01:32:13,750
All right, so, I looked
at your pension stuff.

2115
01:32:13,816 --> 01:32:14,994
Oh, good.

2116
01:32:15,065 --> 01:32:17,334
It's a horror show.

2117
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:20,051
Have you ever heard of mutual funds?

2118
01:32:20,121 --> 01:32:22,260
You know, Mom, honestly,
you would have done a lot better...

2119
01:32:22,329 --> 01:32:25,809
if you'd just stuck it in a shoe box
and put it under your bed.

2120
01:32:25,881 --> 01:32:28,728
Well, that's why I
wanted you to help me.

2121
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:30,702
So-here.
Sign there.

2122
01:32:30,777 --> 01:32:31,726
What is this?

2123
01:32:31,801 --> 01:32:33,491
I have to get your assets
working again.

2124
01:32:33,561 --> 01:32:35,503
- My what?
- Your assets.

2125
01:32:35,576 --> 01:32:39,155
Oh. Oh! Power of attorney.

2126
01:32:39,224 --> 01:32:41,329
Oh! And you spent $6,000 on a bus?

2127
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:42,328
Yeah.

2128
01:32:42,393 --> 01:32:43,669
Why didn't you ask me first?

2129
01:32:43,736 --> 01:32:45,646
Well, I'm sorry.

2130
01:32:45,721 --> 01:32:48,089
So...

2131
01:32:48,153 --> 01:32:50,008
Can I keep the bus or?

2132
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:54,830
We'll talk about it later.

2133
01:32:54,905 --> 01:32:56,759
- Hey-
- That sounds like a no.

2134
01:32:56,824 --> 01:32:57,840
I love you, too.

2135
01:32:57,914 --> 01:32:59,288
Bye, guys.

2136
01:32:59,353 --> 01:33:01,108
Donna?

2137
01:33:01,177 --> 01:33:02,321
- Bye!
- Oh, hey. Bye.

2138
01:33:02,392 --> 01:33:03,473
So long.

2139
01:33:03,545 --> 01:33:04,526
I thought that was
a terrific eulogy you gave...

2140
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:06,389
for old man Soderberg
at his memorial service.

2141
01:33:06,456 --> 01:33:07,384
Thank you.

2142
01:33:07,449 --> 01:33:09,424
Too bad the old coot
couldn't have been there to hear it.

2143
01:33:09,497 --> 01:33:12,792
Yeah, and to have missed it
by just a few days.

2144
01:33:12,857 --> 01:33:14,712
Hmm. Ha ha!

2145
01:33:14,778 --> 01:33:16,020
Ha ha!

2146
01:33:19,544 --> 01:33:20,788
Ha ha ha!

2147
01:33:28,634 --> 01:33:30,062
I still love your laugh.

2148
01:33:30,137 --> 01:33:31,118
Oh, yeah.

2149
01:33:31,192 --> 01:33:33,713
- Hee hee hee!
- I got it.

2150
01:33:33,785 --> 01:33:36,087
I get bored.

2151
01:33:36,153 --> 01:33:37,200
Uh-huh.

2152
01:33:37,273 --> 01:33:39,345
Ha ha ha!

2153
01:33:39,416 --> 01:33:41,140
Thank you.

2154
01:33:41,209 --> 01:33:43,064
That joke just gets better and better.

2155
01:33:43,129 --> 01:33:45,169
- You know?
- Yep.

2156
01:33:48,729 --> 01:33:50,224
Anybody want to change their order?

2157
01:33:52,633 --> 01:33:54,292
Can I get a coffee?

2158
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:58,005
Ha ha ha!

2159
01:33:58,074 --> 01:34:01,045
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha!
