People like to see a fine gown on a woman.

703
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,928
Don'! they?

704
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,644
Er...quile.

705
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,685
There is the question of you showing off your...

706
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,645
My drawers?

707
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,644
In red, while and blue.

708
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,763
It was the King's birthday.
It was a special occasion.

709
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,682
Very pailioiic, I'm sure.

710
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,041
<i>- It won't happen again.</i>
- I <i>hope not.</i>

711
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,044
'She sits amongst the cabbages and peas'?

712
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,201
An innocent song about a lady
who sits in her vegetable garden.

713
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,049
How can 'rt be anything more than that?

714
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,889
I think you know, Miss Lloyd.

715
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,720
So do you suggest that I change
the particular vegetable selected?

716
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,325
- Well, I suppose that's...
- One good substitute.

717
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,362
- Yes.
- Very well.

718
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,007
She sits amongst the oabbag and...leeks?

719
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,489
- Miss Lloyd!
- What?

720
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,522
(Chuckles, then coughs)

721
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,962
And there's the nub of it, gentlemen.

722
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,086
Perhaps it's in the imagination of the audience
and not in the imemion of the performer.

723
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,920
Thank you, Miss Lloyd.
You'll be informed of the commilieds verdict.

724
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,248

I'm sure you'll pass the right motion.

<i>All the lovely ladles to yourself, then.</i>

753
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,730
You should be ashamed of yourself,
charging a shilling to peep at these girls.

754
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,764
- Who's 'rt harming?
- Well, 'rt ain't harming your pocket!

755
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,087
- You do well enough out of me.
- But they don't.

756
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,963
Hardly enough to feed their children.

757
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,810
- If they don't like it...
- No wonder there's talk of strikes.

758
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,888
<i>Here you are. aids</i>

759
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,241

Marie Lloyd to the rescue again.

762
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,688

<i>FREDDIE: Come on, you lot

764
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,247
You're not frightened of anyone, are you?

765
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,487
Well, I'm not frightened of Belafonte.

766
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:56,405
But I am scared that you're not going to
invite me over the road for a drink.

767
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,761
How about...tonight?

768
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,564
Or maybe we should be getting home?

769
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,484
Or maybe you should be
minding your own business.

770
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,208
I'd be delighted, Mr Huriey.

771

(Giggles)

772
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:15,287
- I'm only thinking of you.
- You're not my moral guardian.

773
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,641
I hate 'rt when you're in one of these moods.

774
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,125
You hate me?

775
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,561
- Your moods.
- What moods?

776
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,285
When you're the only person in the wortd
that matters.

777
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,129
What are you doing here, Freddie?

778
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,482
- Sorting out your clothes.
- You're here because I employ you.

779
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,887
That's what you're doing here.

780
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,969
- I've spent my whole life looking after you.
- That's a lie.

781
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,604
Be quiet.

782
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,369
No, I've spent <i>my</i> whole life looking after you.

783
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,529
- You don't want me to be happy.
- I don't want you to make a mistake.

784
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,961
Well, go, then. I don'! need you.

785
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,286
You do.

786
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,482
How dare you think I need you!

787
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,329
You want me to go?

788
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,362
Yes. Go.

00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,762

800
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,691
You meant what you were singing,
didn't you, Alec?

801
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,722
I did.

802
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,762
I could tell.

803
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:20,124
There was a sparkle in them eyes, and
'rt weren't caused by the stage lamps, was it?

804
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,924
No.

805
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,962
What caused it?

806
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,689
You know what caused it.

807
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,846
<i>You did.</i>

808
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,405
As always.

809
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,770
The things you say.

810
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,646
Really'?

811
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,682
(Sighs heavily)

812
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,722
What's up, Alec?

813
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,967
You make me shiver when you hold my hand.

814
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,411
(Giggles)

815
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,442
You need a pair of gloves, darting.

816
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,642
I'll buy you some from Simpson's.

817
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,682
I don't need gloves to keep me warm.

818
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,642
What do you need?

819
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,561
NaUQW-

00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,161
- You're an old rooster, ain't you?
- (Chuckles)

821
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,684
Old faithful, more like.

822
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,562
I could do with some of that right now.

823
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,328
Me too.

824
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,966
Percy Courtney said he would love me forever.

825
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,762
Don'! let me down, Alec, eh?

826
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,291
Never.

827
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,924
I'm sure we can come to an amicable
arrangememt, Miss Lloyd.

828
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,325
Why must 'rt be amicable?

829
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,442
I'll give him £2,000 for three years.

830
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,960
Miss Lloyd, these matters are complicated.

831
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,241
There's the issue of custody. The house.

832
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,203
Those are my terms.

833
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,844
Take 'rt or leave it.

834
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,882
Miss Lloyd, please. Stay.

835
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,485
I'll take it.

836
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,522
SOLICITOR: Oh.

837
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,005
Good day, sir.

838
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,282
- She looks old.
- Yes.

839
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,322
And fat

840
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:21,523
Still...nothing lasts forever, does it?

841
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,562
(Clears throat)

842
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,962
Marie Lloyd does 'rt again.

843
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,689
Oh!

844
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,248
I love these slippers.

845
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,487
(Marie laughs) Oh, Alec, you are funny!

846
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,522
How can anyone love slippers?

847
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,767
I don'! know. I just do. They feel light

848
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,201
Just like you and me in this house together.

849
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,242
- That feels right too.
- Yeah.

850
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,730
We're going to have a lovely little life together.

851
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,171
Lillie?

852
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,884
Where's me champagne?

853
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,882
I thought this morning - tea.

854
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,605
- Tea's for old ladies.
- We're not getting any younger.

855
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,642
Alec, you were born a hundred.

856
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,284
(Chuckles)

857
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,049
We could walk on the heath today.

858
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:16,042
I thought we could work on a double ad.

859
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,202

864
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,121
They can bully you, but they can't bully me.

865
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:45,243
So together we shall be indestructible.

866
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,242
Fair deal for artists!

867
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,608
Fair deal for artists!

868
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,927
What does Marie think she's doing, Alec?

869
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,362
- She won't be talked out of it.
- You know this strike's spreading.

870
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,246
Two more halls in Shoreditch have gone dark.
She'll drive us all out of business.

871
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,886
- I know, sir. But...
- What kind of man are you?

872
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,809
She's your wife. Tell her!

873
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,205
Make her obey you!

874
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,087
He's blaming me for not controlling you.

875
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,122
(Laughs)

876
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,162
What does he think I am, your dog?

877
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,407
I told him that's easier said than done.

878
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,843
If 'rt wasn't for me, those giﬂs would be crushed
and back at work humiliated.

879
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,804
<i>Yeah, but you've made your point now,
though, yeah?</i>

880
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,842
It's not about making a point.

881
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,089
- You'll run out of money at this rate.
- It gives me pleasure.

882
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,329
Yes, but are you doing good
to make yourself feel better?

883
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,249
With this Strike?

884
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,845
What do you suggest, then, Alec?
That we cave in to Belafonte and his like?

885
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,842
No, of course not

886
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:19,169
Tell Miss... Ask Miss Lloyd
to come and see me, would you?

887
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,883
One newspaper has called you a saint.

888
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,287
Ah, how nice of them.

889
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,764
I'll pay you a hundred pounds a week

890
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:34,326
if you break the strike and go back to work.

891
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,681
Don't talk silly. I'm not a blackleg, Arthur.

892
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,449
But you don't seem to mind betraying

893
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,405
those who helped you climb to the top
in the beginning, do you?

894
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,522
It's the public who make you a star, dear.

895
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:48,610
And it's the managers
who pay you handsomely for that privilege.

896
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,449
You only pay me what I'm worth.

897
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,482
And you are worth everything.

898
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:55,967
But you shouldn't sully
your professional reputation.

899
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,324
Especially not when there's an invitation
to perform before the King.

900
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:03,762
We all want you topping the bill
at the Royal Command, but...

901
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,088
Are you attempting to blackmail me,
Mr Belafonte?

902
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,929
Not at all.

903
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,201
I'm appealing to your better nature.

904
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,567
I will not cave in to your demands.

905
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:19,644
The public like me, and His Majesty,
I am sure, is quite aware of that.

906
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,480
I take 'rt that's your last word on the matter?

907
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,409
Minimum performance rates for all of you!

908
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,402
Is everybody hBPPW

909
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,568
- (Cheering)
- You bet your life we are!

910
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,841
Well done, Marie.

911
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,882
Thank you, Arthur.

912
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,922
All is forgiven.

913
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,082
Forgiven, but never forgotten.

914
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,002
I just think, as my

915
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,884
Oh, be quiet, Alec. Just be quiet.

916
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,526
- I was merely pointing out...
- I know, I know.

917
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,562
I should be drinking tea.

918
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,330
Shall we go for a walk?

919
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,561
No.

920
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,685
Just trying to be pleasant

921
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:22,327
And as with everything else, you're failing,
I'm afraid, Alec.

922
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,404
You'll end up with no-one.

923
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,402
(Distant applause)

924
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,245

never to be seen again.

Mane.

928
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,362
You said you'd always look after me.

929
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,289
I thought you...

930
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,448
I knew you'd be missing me.

Because I'll be thinking of you.

Oh, what now?

I know how to behave.

971

But you don't know how to have fun.
That's the difference.

972
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:43,331
- You're a married woman.
- Yes.

973
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:44,964
But I'm not dead.

974
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,082
You're starting to disgust people.

975
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,441
- Can you not see that?
- No, I disgust you.

01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,209
I wouldn't be so sure.

01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,567
You think they're interested in what you do?

980
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,602
No-one would have heard of you if not for me.

981
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:02,564
For what it's worth, people had heard of me.

982
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,851
They clap your ad

You do like him, don'! you, Freddie?

996
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,522
Yeah.

997
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:14,484
Why are they being so horrible about me
in the papers?

998
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,162
- Well...
- Why?

999
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,202
You're supposed to be married.

1000
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:21,049
Huh. Hardly.

1001
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,082
Alec Hurley was a little mistake.

1002
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,202
Surely I'm allowed to make a mistake.

1003
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,651
They like Alec.

1004
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,682
They haven't taken to Bernard.

1005
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,722
They don'! know Bernard.

1006
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,081
They're being cruel about him to get at me.

1007
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:36,442
Still, you like him, Freddie. That's the main thing.

How can there be a Royal Variety Performance
without Marie Lloyd on the bill?

1010
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,326
His Majesty doesn't want you.
Nothing to do with me.

1011
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,011
- Who's 'rt to do with, then?
- Take 'rt up with the King.

1012
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,850
- Is 'rt because of the strike?
- Among other things.

1013
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:57,446
I was coming to the aid of my fellow performers.

1014
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:00,131
I was being honourable.
And for that I'm condemned?

1015
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,889
It's not just the strike, is it?

1016
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,446
Well, what else, then?
What else can 'rt possibly be?

1017
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,891
You read the newspapers.

1018
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,729
