1
00:00:02,074 --> 00:00:03,408
Look at me go,

2
00:00:03,409 --> 00:00:05,575
leading an army of
half-dead zombie warriors

3
00:00:05,577 --> 00:00:06,911
on a quest to save a princess.

4
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:08,879
Now,<i> that</i> is solid hero stuff.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,115
One of your most heroic scenarios, sir.

6
00:00:11,116 --> 00:00:13,017
- Legendary.
- Totally.

7
00:00:13,018 --> 00:00:14,085
Though you have to admit,

8
00:00:14,086 --> 00:00:15,286
when the flesh hits the road,

9
00:00:15,287 --> 00:00:17,521
it is feeling just a bit challenging,

10
00:00:17,522 --> 00:00:19,090
is it not?

11
00:00:19,091 --> 00:00:21,425
[Growling]

12
00:00:21,426 --> 00:00:24,862
[Groaning]

13
00:00:24,863 --> 00:00:27,898
No, guys. Guys, go around the tree.

14
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:28,933
Go around.

15
00:00:28,934 --> 00:00:30,735
[Moaning]

16
00:00:30,736 --> 00:00:31,969
I don't know why I bother.

17
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,537
I mean, they're basically
useless, aren't they?

18
00:00:33,538 --> 00:00:35,339
Yeah, pretty much.

19
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,842
Although I have noticed they
are quite drawn to you, sir.

20
00:00:37,843 --> 00:00:39,910
Maybe it's because you were
briefly dead. [Chuckles]

21
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:42,046
Oh, yes, and why was that, Sid?

22
00:00:42,047 --> 00:00:43,247
Why was I briefly dead?

23
00:00:43,248 --> 00:00:45,549
I told you how bad I feel about that.

24
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,119
- You ever gonna let it go?
- Oh, you mean like

25
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,587
when you let go of the sword
and it flew through the air,

26
00:00:49,588 --> 00:00:52,656
sticking into my chest,
temporarily killing me?

27
00:00:54,226 --> 00:00:57,394
So I'll take that as a "no," then.

28
00:00:59,364 --> 00:01:02,800
Right. We're almost to Valencia.

29
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:03,834
I'm gonna scout ahead to that castle,

30
00:01:03,835 --> 00:01:05,202
see if it's truly empty.

31
00:01:05,203 --> 00:01:08,339
Wow. Valencia.

32
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,874
Seems like just yesterday,

33
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,576
I was the worst tyrant
this land has ever seen.

34
00:01:12,577 --> 00:01:13,878
That was weird.

35
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:16,080
Yeah, cuckoo bananas. You
stay here with Roberta.

36
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:19,950
I think that's a great idea.

37
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:22,419
Don't you, Richard?

38
00:01:23,455 --> 00:01:25,356
Hey, Galavant, quick
story I want to tell you.

39
00:01:25,357 --> 00:01:27,458
I need your advice.

40
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:30,561
I really want to kiss Roberta, and stuff,

41
00:01:30,562 --> 00:01:31,662
and I think the timing is right.

42
00:01:31,663 --> 00:01:33,097
But did she say she likes me?

43
00:01:33,098 --> 00:01:34,231
Get to the point.

44
00:01:34,232 --> 00:01:35,299
Do... do I ask her?

45
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,035
Do I just grab her and kiss her?

46
00:01:38,036 --> 00:01:40,137
Sneak up behind her in
dark clothing, shout "boo,"

47
00:01:40,138 --> 00:01:41,272
and kiss her when she's screaming?

48
00:01:41,273 --> 00:01:43,007
What? Look, I would love to help you.

49
00:01:43,008 --> 00:01:45,176
I've sort of got more
important things to do, okay?

50
00:01:45,177 --> 00:01:48,446
But, no, no, definitely
don't do the "boo" version.

51
00:01:48,447 --> 00:01:50,214
It's sort of frowned upon, okay?

52
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:51,215
I've got to go.

53
00:01:51,216 --> 00:01:53,550
No "boo" version. Good to know.

54
00:01:55,587 --> 00:01:57,321
[Groaning] Look, guys, guys, guys!

55
00:01:57,322 --> 00:01:58,389
Stop! [Groaning stops]

56
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,524
You can't go with me! I'm sneaking.

57
00:02:02,928 --> 00:02:04,962
[Groaning resumes]

58
00:02:04,963 --> 00:02:06,831
No, seriously!

59
00:02:06,832 --> 00:02:09,066
Just... I'm trying to
do a secret castle scout.

60
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:10,066
- [Groaning stops]
- Just...

61
00:02:12,437 --> 00:02:15,773
- [Groaning resumes]
- Oh, for the love of God.

62
00:02:15,774 --> 00:02:17,808
[Groaning stops]

63
00:02:17,809 --> 00:02:21,378
Yeah. Yeah, all right. Come on.

64
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:23,613
[Groaning resumes]

65
00:02:27,018 --> 00:02:28,018
So...

66
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:31,188
Uh, Bobby, I meant to ask you...

67
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:33,257
Hey, what's your favorite tree?

68
00:02:33,258 --> 00:02:35,426
Because kids these days are all into oaks,

69
00:02:35,427 --> 00:02:36,593
but I like a spruce, and...

70
00:02:37,462 --> 00:02:40,965
Mmm!

71
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:42,132
Oh, my God.

72
00:02:43,802 --> 00:02:45,068
That was wonderful.

73
00:02:48,507 --> 00:02:49,572
[Roberta laughs]

74
00:02:51,376 --> 00:02:52,510
So, we'll just stand here

75
00:02:52,511 --> 00:02:54,912
and listen to this happen, then, I guess.

76
00:02:54,913 --> 00:02:56,246

Flag of Truce! Nothing to worry about!

80
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:06,237
Guaranteed safe passage!

81
00:03:06,238 --> 00:03:08,239
Super poor form to kill us!

82
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,574
Will you stop it?

83
00:03:09,575 --> 00:03:11,309
You're making us look like tools.

84
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,311
We are tools... Tools that will be used

85
00:03:13,312 --> 00:03:16,648
to make the Valencian
swords dull... with murder!

86
00:03:16,649 --> 00:03:18,984
Sorry. When I'm nervous,
my jokes get kind of weird.

87
00:03:18,985 --> 00:03:20,051
We'll be fine.

88
00:03:20,052 --> 00:03:21,753
Sure, we can't beat the Valencians

89
00:03:21,754 --> 00:03:23,188
with my cousin's toy army,

90
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:25,857
but terms of surrender are
always offered before a battle.

91
00:03:25,858 --> 00:03:27,592
Easy-peasy, pudding and pie.

92
00:03:27,593 --> 00:03:29,694
We're gonna pudding and die.

93
00:03:29,695 --> 00:03:32,162
I'll try and pull it together.

94
00:03:33,432 --> 00:03:35,300
This was such a good idea.

95
00:03:35,301 --> 00:03:37,235
I think getting out of the
castle was great for us,

96
00:03:37,236 --> 00:03:38,503
you know?

97
00:03:38,504 --> 00:03:40,405
There's nothing like a good old war camp.

98
00:03:40,406 --> 00:03:42,340
Fresh air, sounds of nature.

99
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:44,242
And the promise of getting to kill people.

100
00:03:44,243 --> 00:03:46,678
It just really gives a man
a lift, you know what I mean?

101
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:49,513
Yeah. It's nice.

102
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,985
- What?
- Hmm?

103
00:03:53,986 --> 00:03:55,754
Flag of Truce?

104
00:03:55,755 --> 00:03:56,755
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

105
00:03:56,756 --> 00:03:58,089
What is<i> she</i> doing here?

106
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,859
She's probably come to
discuss terms of surrender.

107
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,494
I don't want her to
surrender. I want to kill her!

108
00:04:06,032 --> 00:04:08,099
Gareth, Madalena.

109
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,601
Princess. And the fool?

110
00:04:12,872 --> 00:04:14,439
Pbht!

111
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,607
Hmm?

112
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:17,509
Sorry. It's pretty tense in here.

113
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,611
I thought we might discuss terms,

114
00:04:19,612 --> 00:04:21,579
avoid unnecessary bloodshed.

115
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,681
Well, I kind of am here for
the unnecessary bloodshed.

116
00:04:23,682 --> 00:04:25,183
The rules of war dictate that...

117
00:04:25,184 --> 00:04:26,918
God, you're going to be
lame about this, aren't you?

118
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:29,454
Fine. Here are my terms.

119
00:04:29,455 --> 00:04:30,622
Complete surrender.

120
00:04:30,623 --> 00:04:32,757
Hand over your castle, your gold,

121
00:04:32,758 --> 00:04:34,959
your jewels, your livestock.

122
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,027
I think that's a bit extreme.

123
00:04:36,028 --> 00:04:37,429
Not done.

124
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,832
All the men of fighting age will
be conscripted into our army.

125
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:44,035
Oh, and I want all the children
to put their toys in a pile.

126
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:46,071
Then I'm going to light it on fire.

127
00:04:46,072 --> 00:04:48,138
[Laughing] Yay! I'm having fun after all.

128
00:04:49,475 --> 00:04:50,874
If I could have a moment.

129
00:04:53,012 --> 00:04:54,712
These terms are impossible!

130
00:04:54,713 --> 00:04:55,780
What choice do we have?

131
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:57,015
[Sighs]

132
00:04:57,016 --> 00:04:59,551
You're right.

133
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:01,719
Your terms are monstrous, but I think...

134
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,786
Oh, and one last thing.

135
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,657
I want you to be my new handmaiden.

136
00:05:11,464 --> 00:05:14,666
Your main duty will be cleaning my crown.

137
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:17,235
That is not your crown.

138
00:05:17,236 --> 00:05:20,205
That is the official crown
of the Queen of Valencia,

139
00:05:20,206 --> 00:05:22,173
and my mother is its rightful owner.

140
00:05:22,174 --> 00:05:23,741
Settle down, tiny tot.

141
00:05:23,742 --> 00:05:26,010
You're the one who came here to surrender.

142
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:28,613
You're gonna regret calling me "tiny tot."

143
00:05:28,614 --> 00:05:30,715
Yes! Catfight!

Wouldn't it be simpler
just to say "The Dew"?

357
00:13:44,654 --> 00:13:47,389
No, you just sign a contract
for your immortal soul.

358
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,060
- Oh.
- Ah, where did I put it?

359
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,062
Ahh.

360
00:13:53,063 --> 00:13:53,962
Here.

361
00:13:53,963 --> 00:13:55,130
If...

362
00:13:55,131 --> 00:13:56,465
[whimpers]

363
00:13:56,466 --> 00:13:59,034
No, no, no. You don't
have to sign in blood.

364
00:13:59,035 --> 00:14:00,969
Huh? I just gave you the knife to hold.

365
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,504
A quill is fine.

366
00:14:02,505 --> 00:14:05,006
[Chuckles]

367
00:14:05,775 --> 00:14:09,143
Yes, but points for enthusiasm, though.

368
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,282
If you could, let's just keep
this as our little secret.

369
00:14:13,283 --> 00:14:15,317
There's no reason Gareth needs to know.

370
00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:16,552
No.

371
00:14:16,553 --> 00:14:18,387
Now please step away from the baby.

372
00:14:18,388 --> 00:14:20,556
You really freaked me out before.

373
00:14:20,557 --> 00:14:22,791
Yes, sure, of course.

374
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:26,228
I want to thank everyone for pitching in

375
00:14:26,229 --> 00:14:28,564
and collecting things
we can use as weapons.

376
00:14:28,565 --> 00:14:33,502
But we may need to sort through
and pick out the best bits.

377
00:14:33,503 --> 00:14:35,070
Okay?

378
00:14:35,071 --> 00:14:35,903
Right.

379
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:40,409
Pots and pans. Very good for bonking heads.

380
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:43,277
A couple of spatulas, a whisk.

381
00:14:44,814 --> 00:14:47,249
Weren't there any knives in the kitchen?

382
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,485
No? Shame.

383
00:14:49,486 --> 00:14:51,352
I've got a potato. It's very pointy.

384
00:14:52,422 --> 00:14:54,056
I didn't find any weapons,

385
00:14:54,057 --> 00:14:55,724
but I'm really going
to give those Valencians

386
00:14:55,725 --> 00:14:56,959
a piece of my mind.

387
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,395
Her words can be very cutting.

388
00:14:59,396 --> 00:15:02,164
Well, we don't have much
in the way as weapons.

389
00:15:02,165 --> 00:15:05,167
But, uh, we got grit.

390
00:15:05,168 --> 00:15:06,334
And determination.

391
00:15:07,771 --> 00:15:09,437
Yah!

392
00:15:11,441 --> 00:15:14,409
I mean, it's a bit desperate, isn't it?

393
00:15:16,045 --> 00:15:18,547
Come on, guys. Show me something.

394
00:15:18,548 --> 00:15:21,049
There must be more than this aimless amble.

395
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,584
You were soldiers once, weren't you?

396
00:15:22,585 --> 00:15:24,453
Don't you remember any of that?

397
00:15:24,454 --> 00:15:25,587
Huh?

398
00:15:25,588 --> 00:15:26,889
All right, raise your weapons.

399
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,224
[Groaning]

400
00:15:29,225 --> 00:15:31,059
Or not.

401
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,694
Maybe you'll respond to danger!

402
00:15:32,695 --> 00:15:33,896
Aah!

403
00:15:33,897 --> 00:15:37,433
[Thud] Oh, for the love of...

404
00:15:37,434 --> 00:15:38,767
I'm gonna fail.

405
00:15:38,768 --> 00:15:40,369
I'm gonna fail.

406
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,204
[Sighs]

407
00:15:42,205 --> 00:15:46,708
And Isabella is gonna die
thinking I don't love her,

408
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:48,844
which isn't true.

409
00:15:48,845 --> 00:15:52,581
I love her to the very fiber of my being.

410
00:15:52,582 --> 00:15:54,615
And she'll never know.

411
00:15:56,619 --> 00:15:58,887
Aww.

412
00:15:58,888 --> 00:16:02,124
I love her.

413
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,891
Looooove.

414
00:16:05,328 --> 00:16:07,496
I came back from the dead for love.

415
00:16:07,497 --> 00:16:09,264
Does love speak to you?

416
00:16:09,265 --> 00:16:11,132
All: Looooove.

417
00:16:12,202 --> 00:16:13,634
Will you follow me for love?

418
00:16:16,272 --> 00:16:18,140
Will you fight with me for love?

419
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:19,575
All: Love!

420
00:16:19,576 --> 00:16:21,543
Now, who's with me? For love!

421
00:16:21,544 --> 00:16:23,312
- All: Love!
- Love!

422
00:16:23,313 --> 00:16:24,646
- Love!
- Love!

423
00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:25,881
Love!

424
00:16:25,882 --> 00:16:28,150
[Speaking gibbering]

425
00:16:28,151 --> 00:16:29,551
Yes.

426
00:16:29,552 --> 00:16:32,019
Well said, my friend. Well said.

427
00:16:38,777 --> 00:16:42,146
Let's saddle up. It's time for battle.

428
00:16:42,147 --> 00:16:44,248
I am ready for war.

429
00:16:44,249 --> 00:16:47,217
And not just to sit in a comfy
chair and watch up on a hill

430
00:16:47,218 --> 00:16:48,452
while eating cucumber sandwiches,

431
00:16:48,453 --> 00:16:50,687
although that was delightful.

432
00:16:50,688 --> 00:16:54,339
No, I am actually ready to
stand next to you and fight.

433
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:56,226
Sounds like you found
your manhood, Richard.

434
00:16:56,227 --> 00:16:59,229
Bobby found it... A bunch of times,

435
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,397
if you know what I'm saying, huh?

436
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:02,232
Unfortunately, I do.

437
00:17:02,233 --> 00:17:03,600
Ow. [Inhales sharply]

438
00:17:03,601 --> 00:17:05,869
That's really thick armor.

439
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,171
Has anyone seen Sid?

440
00:17:07,172 --> 00:17:10,274
There's this one strap on
my armor I can never get.

441
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:11,408
Oh, sorry.

442
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:14,644
He asked me to give you this last night.

443
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:21,618
"I can't stand the shame
of having briefly killed

444
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:23,721
the greatest hero in the seven realms.

445
00:17:23,722 --> 00:17:26,824
I've left to redeem myself. Sid."

446
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:28,325
He doesn't need to redeem himself.

447
00:17:28,326 --> 00:17:30,694
I was just giving him
a hard t... Damn it, Gal.

448
00:17:30,695 --> 00:17:33,297
Mother always said she
never knew when I was joking.

449
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:35,032
Oh, I hate it when mother is right.

450
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:36,432
I'm gonna go find him.

451
00:17:40,004 --> 00:17:42,940
Strange being in this room again.

452
00:17:42,941 --> 00:17:45,743
It seems like a lifetime
ago I sat on that throne.

453
00:17:45,744 --> 00:17:48,311
So much has changed.

454
00:17:50,482 --> 00:17:54,413
Ah, if I ever got the chance to be a king
again, I would do things so differently.

455
00:17:57,322 --> 00:17:59,690
Richard, I have to tell you something.

456
00:17:59,691 --> 00:18:00,657
- Hmm?
- [Clears throat]

457
00:18:00,658 --> 00:18:01,592
Um...

458
00:18:01,593 --> 00:18:05,629
It's hard to say, but, um...

459
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,132
I can't go into battle with you.

460
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:10,300
What are you talking about?

461
00:18:10,301 --> 00:18:12,102
Richard, you're not a fighter,

462
00:18:12,103 --> 00:18:14,772
and I love you too much to watch you die.

463
00:18:14,773 --> 00:18:17,708
And...You will die.

464
00:18:17,709 --> 00:18:19,076
Horribly.

465
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:21,078
Mutilated.

466
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,813
- Crying blood.
- [Scoffs] Okay.

467
00:18:22,814 --> 00:18:23,947
Having soiled yourself

468
00:18:23,948 --> 00:18:25,783
with people trying to cut off your head.

469
00:18:25,784 --> 00:18:28,218
People pointing and laughing,

470
00:18:28,219 --> 00:18:30,120
gloating on the battlefield.

471
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:31,889
- It's gonna be hideous.
- Okay.

472
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,057
- It can be quite fun, but not for you.
- Got it.

473
00:18:34,058 --> 00:18:36,059
I can't be part of that.

474
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,327
It'll destroy me.

475
00:18:37,328 --> 00:18:41,198
My darling, you worry
too much. I'll be fine.

476
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:44,401
Yes, perhaps a bit less confident

477
00:18:44,402 --> 00:18:47,237
after your very charmingly
graphic description,

478
00:18:47,238 --> 00:18:49,373
but believe me, I'll be fine.

479
00:18:49,374 --> 00:18:52,009
Let's forget this whole battle and leave

480
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,578
and go and build a life for ourselves.

481
00:18:54,579 --> 00:18:57,881
My aunt has a farm across the lonely sea,

482
00:18:57,882 --> 00:18:59,583
in the shadow of mount spinster.

483
00:18:59,584 --> 00:19:01,919
It's so beautiful. Lots of cats.

484
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,521
We can be happy there.

485
00:19:04,522 --> 00:19:07,390
- I can get us one-way tickets, and...
- Bobby.

486
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,994
I have to do this.

487
00:19:10,995 --> 00:19:12,428
I can't let Galavant down.

488
00:19:14,132 --> 00:19:15,631
And I can't watch you die.

489
00:19:20,271 --> 00:19:21,537
So, what are we saying?

490
00:19:24,676 --> 00:19:26,876
I think we're saying goodbye.

491
00:19:40,725 --> 00:19:44,060
Let's make this sacrifice worth it.

492
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:50,200
For love.

493
00:19:50,201 --> 00:19:51,201
For love!

494
00:19:51,202 --> 00:19:53,236
