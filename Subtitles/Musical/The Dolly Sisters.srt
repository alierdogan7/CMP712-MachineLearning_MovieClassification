00:28:57,166 --> 00:29:00,226
He said they would
be here at 2:30.

330
00:29:00,303 --> 00:29:02,396
Well, Mr. Hammerstein's
always a little late.

331
00:29:02,472 --> 00:29:06,568
Oh, he's two days late this time,
and on our money. Borrowed money.

332
00:29:06,642 --> 00:29:09,372
They'll be here.
Harry said so.

333
00:29:09,445 --> 00:29:13,245
Oh, of all the idiotic things
I ever let you talk me into.

334
00:29:13,316 --> 00:29:15,546
And-And the wardrobe
you've charged.

335
00:29:15,618 --> 00:29:18,485
Such fine references
I gave for you.

336
00:29:18,554 --> 00:29:22,046
- What references?
- What references? The Hungarian ambassador.

337
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:24,184
- [Rings]
- Oh. [Gasps]

338
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:27,388
Give it to me.
Give it to me. Hello?

339
00:29:27,463 --> 00:29:30,091
Hello? Hello?

What? Yes.
Yes, send them right up.

Quick! Quick!
They're coming! They're coming!

343
00:29:38,508 --> 00:29:41,534
- Now, Miss Smarty, who's an idiot?
- I don't believe it.

344
00:29:41,611 --> 00:29:45,206
Girls, don't forget the Hungarian accents
you were born with.

345
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:49,149
- I wish I could show you what I mean.

I'm sorry we're late, ladies,
but Mr. Hammerstein was detained at his banker's.

348
00:29:59,695 --> 00:30:02,323
Mr. Hammerstein,
I want you to meet Miss Jansci Dolly.

- What is his name, please?

00:30:08,935 --> 00:30:11,768
Hammerstein.
Oscar Hammerstein.

352
00:30:11,838 --> 00:30:16,400
I do not hear of him before.
Is he important manager?

353
00:30:16,476 --> 00:30:21,379
Well, he's only the biggest
and most important manager in America.

354
00:30:21,447 --> 00:30:24,439
- [Together] Oh.
- Then we will consider him.

355

- No, Rozsicka?
- Mm. Yes, Jansci.

356
00:30:29,455 --> 00:30:31,787
Won't you come in, please?

From Budapest?

395
00:33:56,696 --> 00:33:59,096
<i>Never.</i>

396
00:33:59,165 --> 00:34:03,397
Never before have I seen
two such lovely girls.

00:34:03,469 --> 00:34:06,404
- You mean you like us?
- You'll take us?

you come from- Budapest or Brooklyn.

402
00:34:31,631 --> 00:34:34,464
If you're a lonely little lady

00:34:34,534 --> 00:34:37,992

Don't be too old-fashioned

Old-fashioned girl

409
00:34:57,824 --> 00:35:03,729
Give yourself that 1915 flair

When you're walking up
Fifth Avenue

Don't get too upset

413
00:35:14,073 --> 00:35:20,069
If your petticoat is showing

414
00:35:20,146 --> 00:35:24,276
Be like Irene Castle

415
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:27,342
And bob your hair

416
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:33,086
Throw away your flannel underwear

Be a suffragette

00:35:42,602 --> 00:35:48,234
And order an old-fashioned

00:35:48,307 --> 00:35:54,268
Old-fashioned girl

421
00:35:54,347 --> 00:35:57,373

00:36:03,656 --> 00:36:07,786
You won't be too old-fashioned

425
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,953
If you wake up

426
00:36:10,029 --> 00:36:14,363

He used to write me every day
no matter where he was playing.

494
00:41:38,624 --> 00:41:42,890
I guess he's met someone else
and hasn't the nerve to tell me.

495
00:41:42,962 --> 00:41:47,296
Could be. Well, I'm gonna go
tell Flo about Paris.

00:42:37,917 --> 00:42:40,442
Oh.

506
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:44,114
Oh, Harry, why didn't you
let me know you were coming?

507
00:42:44,189 --> 00:42:46,350
Well, I couldn't.

508
00:42:46,425 --> 00:42:50,521
I just happened to be in town, and I got
a sudden impulse to drop by and say hello.

509
00:42:50,596 --> 00:42:53,087
You know me-
Always obey that impulse.

510
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:56,292
Oh.

511
00:42:56,368 --> 00:43:00,361
Well, Rosie and I have obeyed one too.
We're sailing day after tomorrow.

512
00:43:00,439 --> 00:43:02,999
We've signed with Philippe
for a show in Paris.

513
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:08,608
Paris? Well, gee,
that-that's great.

514
00:43:10,749 --> 00:43:12,876
You're really glad.

515
00:43:12,952 --> 00:43:14,977
Well-Well, of course.

516
00:43:15,054 --> 00:43:18,023
It's- It's what you want,
isn't it?

517
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:20,081
Of course.

518
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:22,320
That's what you want too,
isn't it?

519
00:43:22,394 --> 00:43:26,990
Or maybe Paris isn't far enough.
Maybe you'd like it if I went to China.

520
00:43:27,066 --> 00:43:32,936
- Oh, Harry, be honest with me.
What's happened to us?
- Nothing.

521
00:43:33,005 --> 00:43:37,908
- Is- Is there someone else?
- You know it isn't that.

522
00:43:37,977 --> 00:43:42,175
Well, then it must be something.
It- It can't just be the separation.

523
00:43:42,247 --> 00:43:44,306
Then what?

524
00:43:46,085 --> 00:43:50,579
Oh, Harry, it isn't because
I landed on top first, is it?

525
00:43:50,656 --> 00:43:53,921
Oh, you fool.
You darling fool.

526
00:43:53,993 --> 00:43:56,086
How can that
make any difference?

527
00:43:56,161 --> 00:44:00,598
But it does, Jenny.
And it's not just a matter of pride.

528
00:44:00,666 --> 00:44:04,124
But you love me, don't you?
And I love you.

529
00:44:04,203 --> 00:44:06,467
That's all that counts.
Everything else is nonsense.

530
00:44:06,538 --> 00:44:08,597
No, it isn't nonsense,
Jenny.

531
00:44:08,674 --> 00:44:11,905
I've seen other people try it,
dozens of them.

532
00:44:11,977 --> 00:44:14,605
Oh, it's not just
the money or the fame.

533
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:19,208
It's a lot of other little things
all added up. It just won't work.

534
00:44:19,284 --> 00:44:22,276
Oh, it's all right as long as the stardust
is still there...

535
00:44:22,354 --> 00:44:27,519
but then the stardust blows away
and a kind of poison sets in.

536
00:44:29,161 --> 00:44:33,120
In- In other words, you-
you don't want to marry me.

537
00:44:33,198 --> 00:44:35,962
- More than anything else in the world.
- Oh.

538
00:44:36,035 --> 00:44:39,129
But I can't.
Not till I get someplace.

539
00:44:40,539 --> 00:44:43,337
Not even if I ditch
the Paris engagement?

540
00:44:44,871 --> 00:44:47,135
I can't let you
do that, Jenny.

541
00:44:48,642 --> 00:44:50,803
Oh, I see.

542
00:44:50,877 --> 00:44:53,937
Well, there's no use
dragging things out, is there?

543
00:44:54,014 --> 00:44:57,848
I mean, we-we might as well
make a clean break and say good-bye.

544
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,245
Yeah, I guess so.

545
00:45:02,322 --> 00:45:06,156
- Good-bye then.
- Good-bye, Jenny.

546
00:45:06,226 --> 00:45:11,755
Uh, no more letters.
Not that you've been writing much lately.

547
00:45:11,832 --> 00:45:14,027
No. No more letters.

548
00:45:14,101 --> 00:45:17,093
But- But we'll
always be friends?

549
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:19,229
Sure, sure.

550
00:45:20,841 --> 00:45:23,105
Good-bye, Jenny.

551
00:45:24,745 --> 00:45:26,838
Good-bye.

552
00:45:29,549 --> 00:45:31,414
Good-bye.

553
00:45:36,123 --> 00:45:38,250
Buy you a cup of coffee?

554
00:45:39,626 --> 00:45:42,925
It's no use, Harry.
Just go, will you?

555
00:45:58,812 --> 00:46:03,272
That Daly woman. She had to dope out
tomorrow's horses at New Orleans.

556
00:46:08,622 --> 00:46:11,989
- Come on. We're late.
- All right.

557
00:46:13,827 --> 00:46:16,694
- I can't. I'm going home.
- But you promised.

558
00:46:16,763 --> 00:46:18,822
That's what I said.

559
00:46:33,613 --> 00:46:35,672
Taxi!

560
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,033
Taxi!

561
00:47:02,108 --> 00:47:04,099
<i>Taxi!</i>

562
00:47:08,348 --> 00:47:10,873
Oh, thank you. Oh!

563
00:47:10,951 --> 00:47:14,614
- Oh, I was looking for a taxi.
- So I see.

564
00:47:14,688 --> 00:47:17,987
I'll get you one, but it'll take time.
You better take me up on that coffee first.

565
00:47:18,058 --> 00:47:20,754
- No, thanks very much, but I-
- Now see here. You're drenched.

566
00:47:20,827 --> 00:47:23,057
Do you want to get
to Paris with pneumonia?

567
00:47:23,129 --> 00:47:26,656
- Well, I guess not.
- All right, then. Come on.

568
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:34,730
Here you are, Miss Dolly.
That will warm you up.

569
00:47:34,808 --> 00:47:38,437
- Thank you, Mr. Dowling.
-<i>[Ends]</i>

570
00:47:38,512 --> 00:47:42,414
Never forget the first time
I saw those knees.

571
00:47:42,482 --> 00:47:44,575
On the way to Elmira,
remember?

572
00:47:44,651 --> 00:47:47,119
Sure.

573
00:47:47,187 --> 00:47:50,179
- You and your half fare.
- [Chuckles]

574
00:47:55,662 --> 00:47:58,096
- There.
- Thank you.

575
00:48:02,736 --> 00:48:05,261
I think the patient has
an even chance to recover.

576
00:48:05,338 --> 00:48:07,932
Oh, thank you, Doctor.
You have a lovely manner.

577
00:48:08,008 --> 00:48:10,067
Thank you.

578
00:48:16,016 --> 00:48:19,645
- How about a bite to eat?
- No, thank you. I don't care for anything.

579
00:48:23,256 --> 00:48:25,520
Uh, what are you doing
about your songs?

580
00:48:25,592 --> 00:48:29,358
Oh, nothing much.
Except "Rainbows." Remember it?

581
00:48:29,429 --> 00:48:32,023
Oh, yes. I liked it.

582
00:48:33,633 --> 00:48:36,124
Well, it goes like this now.

583
00:48:36,202 --> 00:48:40,036
[Humming]

584
00:48:41,975 --> 00:48:46,537
Well, I knew I was coming to a party,
so I brought my music along.

585
00:48:46,613 --> 00:48:51,107
- Here you are, Mr. Harris.
Help yourself, Mr. Tannen.
- Thank you. After you, Sam.

597
00:51:59,439 --> 00:52:01,737
- Hello, Jenny.
- Oh, hello.

598
00:52:01,808 --> 00:52:03,833
- Did you write that song?
- Sure.

599
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:06,242
- I like it a lot.
- Oh, really, Sam?

600
00:52:06,312 --> 00:52:08,780
Oh. Oh, uh, this is Mr. Harris
of Cohan and Harris.

601
00:52:08,848 --> 00:52:10,782
- This is Harry Fox.
- How do you do?

602
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:12,875
- Hello.
- Why don't you stop at my office sometime?

603
00:52:12,952 --> 00:52:15,182
- I'd like to talk business to you.
- I'd be glad to.

604
00:52:15,255 --> 00:52:17,189
- When could you come?
- How about right now?

605
00:52:17,257 --> 00:52:20,454
- No. Tomorrow will do. Good night, Jenny.
- Good night, Sam.

606
00:52:20,527 --> 00:52:22,552
- Good night, young fella.
- Good night.

607
00:52:22,629 --> 00:52:26,395
- Good night, Dowling. Good night, Jules.
- Good night, Sam.

608
00:52:26,466 --> 00:52:29,958
- If he puts it in a show,
it means half a million copies.
- Yeah.

609
00:52:30,036 --> 00:52:33,631
You see, a twist of the wrist
and you're a hit too.

610
00:52:35,341 --> 00:52:39,937
Oh, Harry, do I have to go to Paris?
I don't want to.

611
00:52:40,013 --> 00:52:43,972
But, Jenny, the Folies Bergère,
think of the chance.

612
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:46,450
I still don't want to.

613
00:52:46,519 --> 00:52:50,046
Darling, nobody can turn down
an offer like that.

614
00:52:50,123 --> 00:52:52,614
Nobody, darling?

615
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:10,864
[Doorbell Rings]

616
00:53:14,545 --> 00:53:18,106
<i>Excuse me, Mrs. Fox, for buttin' in like this.</i>
<i>I'm Morrie Keno- Keno and Kraus.</i>

617
00:53:18,182 --> 00:53:20,810
- Hello.
- We played on the bill with you
and Rosie in Atlanta once.

618
00:53:20,884 --> 00:53:23,682
You wouldn't remember our act.
[Chuckling] We were on too early.

619
00:53:23,754 --> 00:53:27,246
Anyway, when war was declared, my partner
enlisted right away. Me, I couldn't make it myself.

620
00:53:27,324 --> 00:53:29,417
I'm putting on shows here
to sell Liberty bonds.

621
00:53:29,493 --> 00:53:32,758
There's one tonight at the hotel.
I'd like to have you and your sister go on for us.

622
00:53:32,829 --> 00:53:35,161
People love you, and you'll
sell bonds like wildfire.

623
00:53:35,232 --> 00:53:38,326
Try and bring Mr. Fox along, but I know
he's singin' at recruiting rallies all the time.

624
00:53:38,402 --> 00:53:41,394
Sure made a big hit at the Palace.
Had it comin' to him. Swell fella.

625
00:53:41,471 --> 00:53:43,996
Thanks for comin' tonight.
I'll announce you myself.

626
00:53:44,074 --> 00:53:46,133
- That's about all I can do to help.
- Why-

627
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:48,337
My partner enlisted right away.
I couldn't make it.

628
00:53:48,412 --> 00:53:51,176
Nice hearing your voice again,
Mrs. Fox. See ya tonight. Ahem.

629
00:53:51,248 --> 00:53:54,581
- Thanks a million.
- We'll be there, and thanks,
Mr. Keno, for dropping in.

630
00:53:54,651 --> 00:53:57,518
It's all right.

631
00:53:57,588 --> 00:53:59,419
Whew!

632
00:54:02,859 --> 00:54:06,158
- Kathi, do you think it's ready yet?
- Just about.

633
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:08,755
Oh! Here, let me
take it out myself.

634
00:54:08,832 --> 00:54:13,496
- Ooh!
- Better you should use these, Miss Jenny.

635
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:16,596
- Ah.
- <i>Jenny, don't tell me you did that all by yourself?</i>

636
00:54:16,673 --> 00:54:19,836
Mm-hmm. Well, Kathi
helped me a little bit.

637
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:22,572
<i>[Latsie]</i>
<i>Jenny, we have news for you.</i>

638
00:54:22,646 --> 00:54:26,514
Where's Harry? I thought you were
picking him up at the Friars.
