166
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:58,078
Oh, yes.

167
00:11:58,445 --> 00:12:00,436
And you Mr...

168
00:12:01,525 --> 00:12:02,719
[Murmurs provocatively]

169
00:12:17,965 --> 00:12:20,354
Come, Rita, let's get this business over with.

170
00:12:20,445 --> 00:12:23,994
JORDAN: Spider, see that I'm not disturbed
by anyone. Come, Rita.

171
00:12:24,085 --> 00:12:25,677
All right, boss.

172
00:12:25,765 --> 00:12:27,164
Serge, come.

173
00:12:28,245 --> 00:12:29,803
Pearl?

174
00:12:30,965 --> 00:12:33,035
PEARL: Here I come.
LOU: Come on, honey.

175
00:12:34,325 --> 00:12:36,316
[Lou hums a lively tune]

176
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,562
- I just loves to work for you, Miss Lou.
- Yeah?

177
00:12:42,765 --> 00:12:46,155
You buy such pretty things.
And all them diamonds.

178
00:12:46,245 --> 00:12:48,918
- You're so rich.
- Yes. I wasn't always rich.

179
00:12:49,005 --> 00:12:49,994
No?

180
00:12:50,085 --> 00:12:53,361
There was a time I didn't know
where my next husband was coming from.

181
00:12:53,445 --> 00:12:56,721
Yeah, but I means is you ain't never been
in the circumstances...

182
00:12:56,805 --> 00:12:58,636
where the wolf came to your door.

183
00:12:58,725 --> 00:12:59,874
The wolf at my door?

184
00:12:59,965 --> 00:13:03,753
Why, I remember when he came
right into my room and had pups.

185
00:13:06,565 --> 00:13:08,362
KELLY: Well?
MRS. CASSIDY: A pint, Kelly.

186
00:13:10,085 --> 00:13:13,361
- Did you fix it like I told you, Mrs. Cassidy?
- No.

187
00:13:13,485 --> 00:13:17,000
Always take a bit of butter
and rub it at the bottom of the can.

188
00:13:17,085 --> 00:13:19,758
- That kills the suds.
- Is that so?

189
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,921
<i>I never thought of that at all.</i>

190
00:13:22,085 --> 00:13:24,280
MRS. CASSIDY: Why didn't you
tell me that before?

191
00:13:24,365 --> 00:13:25,798
MRS. FLAHERTY: I don't know.

192
00:13:48,045 --> 00:13:49,034
[Sally screams]

193
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,844
Spider?

194
00:13:51,925 --> 00:13:54,917
SPIDER: Yeah, what's the matter?
MAN: Look at that.

195
00:13:55,005 --> 00:13:57,041
I got it. Get out of the way.

196
00:13:58,725 --> 00:14:01,319
SPIDER: Get out of the way.
Give her some air, will you?

197
00:14:02,685 --> 00:14:03,913
What's the trouble?

198
00:14:04,005 --> 00:14:07,395
This girl tried to croak herself,
but they stopped her before she could.

199
00:14:07,485 --> 00:14:10,841
All right, Spider, bring her up.
Bill, fix up something for her.

200
00:14:10,925 --> 00:14:12,119
Right away, Lou.

201
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:16,118
Think of trying to bump herself off in here,
of all places.

202
00:14:16,205 --> 00:14:18,435
She come to the right place, all right.

203
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:22,598
SPIDER: What do I do with the kid, Lou?
LOU: Put her right over here, Spider.

204
00:14:22,965 --> 00:14:24,080
LOU: Where's Gus?

205
00:14:24,165 --> 00:14:27,521
He's down in his office. He left word
not to be disturbed for anything.

206
00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:30,403
Thanks. You go downstairs
and shut that crowd up, will you?

207
00:14:30,485 --> 00:14:34,034
You can go, Spider. I'll look after her.
Poor kid looks like she is all in.

208
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,559
She must have been up against it
to want to croak herself.

209
00:14:36,645 --> 00:14:38,237
Come on, take this. Here.

210
00:14:47,005 --> 00:14:49,200
Come on. This will fix you up.

211
00:14:52,765 --> 00:14:56,644
- What's the matter? Committed murder?
- No, not that. I never will.

212
00:14:56,725 --> 00:15:00,115
Then you have nothing to worry about.
At least the guy is alive.

213
00:15:00,205 --> 00:15:01,923
How did you know there was a man?

214
00:15:02,005 --> 00:15:05,042
There always is.
It takes two to get one in trouble.

215
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,922
You know everything about me.

216
00:15:07,005 --> 00:15:10,884
I wouldn't say that, but I am observant.
Come on, move over here.

217
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:13,558
Sit down there.

218
00:15:16,965 --> 00:15:18,762
What was he? Married?

219
00:15:18,845 --> 00:15:21,564
Yes, but I didn't know.

220
00:15:21,645 --> 00:15:24,205
Makes no difference to me
whether you did or not.

221
00:15:24,285 --> 00:15:27,641
Men's all alike, married or single.
It's their game.

222
00:15:27,805 --> 00:15:30,956
I happen to be smart enough
to play it their way.

223
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:32,837
You'll come to it.

224
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,240
Where've you been?

225
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:37,714
Just when I need you most of all,
you ain't around.

226
00:15:37,805 --> 00:15:39,636
I ain't been no place, Miss Lou.

227
00:15:39,725 --> 00:15:41,955
You ain't been no place,
you've just been lost.

228
00:15:42,045 --> 00:15:44,639
Get my little friend here fixed up
with some new clothes.

229
00:15:44,725 --> 00:15:46,602
Get these rags off her.

230
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:49,200
LOU: What's your name, dear?
SALLY: Sally.

231
00:15:49,285 --> 00:15:51,674
LOU: Sally, what?
SALLY: Sally Glynn.

232
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:56,920
Always remember to smile.
You'll never have anything to worry about.

233
00:15:57,005 --> 00:16:00,998
Forget about this guy.
See that you get a good one the next time.

234
00:16:01,165 --> 00:16:02,883
Who'd want me after what I've done?

235
00:16:02,965 --> 00:16:06,321
Listen, when women go wrong,
men go right after them.

236
00:16:07,605 --> 00:16:09,641
You want to put more petticoats on her?

237
00:16:09,725 --> 00:16:11,363
No, she's got enough on.

238
00:16:11,445 --> 00:16:15,643
Wouldn't need any of them if they didn't stuff
this furniture with horsehair.

239
00:16:16,605 --> 00:16:19,039
If you was to go out
and something were to happen...

240
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:22,356
I wouldn't want no policeman to catch me
without no petticoat.

241
00:16:22,445 --> 00:16:25,039
No policeman? How about a nice fireman?

242
00:16:26,005 --> 00:16:27,643
That's the spirit, sister.

243
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:30,239
JORDAN: Lou, I'm just bringing the folks in.
LOU: All right.

244
00:16:30,325 --> 00:16:32,395
Such a gorgeous place, Gus.

245
00:16:32,565 --> 00:16:35,079
I didn't think such a room existed
in this house.

246
00:16:35,165 --> 00:16:37,554
Everything here imported special from Paris.

247
00:16:37,645 --> 00:16:39,237
LOU: Hello, Rita.
RITA: Hello, Lou.

248
00:16:39,325 --> 00:16:41,793
I didn't expect to see you so soon.

249
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:44,474
LOU: You're here, too? How nice.
JORDAN: Lou?

250
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:48,003
What's become of the girl
who caused the excitement downstairs?

251
00:16:48,085 --> 00:16:50,645
She's inside. Pearl's fixing her up.
She'll be all right.

252
00:16:50,725 --> 00:16:54,001
You gotta do something about people
using your joint for a morgue.

253
00:16:54,085 --> 00:16:57,361
- What about this poor creature, Lou?
- Some guy done her wrong.

254
00:16:57,445 --> 00:17:00,676
The story's so old
it should have been set to music long ago.

255
00:17:00,765 --> 00:17:03,120
I would like to see this girl, Lou.

256
00:17:03,205 --> 00:17:05,765
I think, perhaps,
I could do something for her.

257
00:17:05,845 --> 00:17:08,075
That'll be great. I'll send her in.

258
00:17:08,165 --> 00:17:11,521
- You look after her, Gus. I gotta dress.
- All right.

259
00:17:13,285 --> 00:17:16,960
- I think she would be very useful to us.
- Don't mention it.

260
00:17:19,565 --> 00:17:22,841
How charming. How lovely.

261
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:25,075
Come, sit over here with us.

262
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,241
What a sweet, innocent face.

263
00:17:34,325 --> 00:17:36,520
Can't you do something for her, Rita?

264
00:17:36,645 --> 00:17:39,205
Can you sing and dance, perhaps?

265
00:17:39,485 --> 00:17:41,521
Not very well, I'm afraid.

266
00:17:41,925 --> 00:17:45,838
- But you'd be willing to learn?
- Yes, I guess so.

267
00:17:46,685 --> 00:17:50,963
Then, I think I can find you
a very nice position.

268
00:17:51,645 --> 00:17:55,081
Have you heard, perhaps,
of the Barbary Coast?

269
00:17:55,605 --> 00:17:59,598
No, I don't think so.
But it wouldn't make any difference.

270
00:18:00,565 --> 00:18:03,204
Your people? Your parents?

271
00:18:03,285 --> 00:18:06,004
I don't want them to know
anything about me.

272
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,360
I don't want them to know where I am.

273
00:18:08,445 --> 00:18:11,403
You just leave everything to your friend, Rita.

274
00:18:11,565 --> 00:18:16,002
There you are. Come with us now, little girl.
We'll take good care of you.

275
00:18:16,285 --> 00:18:17,604
Thank you so much.

276
00:18:17,685 --> 00:18:20,404
Lou, we're going to help this little girl.

277
00:18:20,485 --> 00:18:22,476
LOU: All right, Gus. She's a nice kid.

278
00:18:22,565 --> 00:18:26,035
- Are you busy?
- Yeah, I'm a little late getting dressed.

279
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,160
Come, Serge.

280
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:29,201
LOU: See you later.
RITA: All right, Lou.

281
00:18:29,965 --> 00:18:32,160
Come up again, any time.

282
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:36,154
I shall. Then I hope you will be alone.

283
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:37,473
So do I.

284
00:18:41,405 --> 00:18:43,396
Warm, dark, and handsome.

285
00:18:44,925 --> 00:18:48,679
- Your bath is ready, Miss Lou.
- You take it. I'm indisposed.

286
00:18:50,725 --> 00:18:52,124
Serge, come.

287
00:18:57,405 --> 00:18:59,475
All right, Spider, just a minute. Here you are.

288
00:18:59,565 --> 00:19:01,760
You go with Rita,
she'll take good care of you.

289
00:19:01,845 --> 00:19:05,804
Sally, you come with me, dear.
I will take very good care of you.

290
00:19:14,045 --> 00:19:15,239
Pearl.

291
00:19:15,965 --> 00:19:18,479
LOU: Pearl?
PEARL: I is coming.

292
00:19:18,565 --> 00:19:21,125
Yeah, you is coming,
your head is bending low.

293
00:19:21,205 --> 00:19:23,275
Now, get here before winter.

294
00:19:23,365 --> 00:19:25,674
- Here I is.
- Here you is.

295
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:28,882
Eight Ball, what're you doing?
Working for me or sleeping for me?

296
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:32,321
I ain't sleeping so much that I don't see
what's going on around here.

297
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:33,679
What've you been seeing?

298
00:19:33,765 --> 00:19:35,915
That fellow from the mission.

299
00:19:36,805 --> 00:19:38,955
Mr... What's his name?

300
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:41,764
Y'all know what's his name, Miss Lou.

301
00:19:41,845 --> 00:19:46,043
I'm surprised at you, with all
your experience, casting eyes on a preacher.

302
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:49,083
Now, Pearl, you know I've never been
interested in a man's job.

303
00:19:49,165 --> 00:19:50,996
Besides, he ain't a preacher.

304
00:19:51,085 --> 00:19:54,794
Anyhow, he ain't like the other men
you done made history of.

305
00:19:54,885 --> 00:19:57,445
No, that's what makes him
kind of interesting.

306
00:19:57,525 --> 00:20:01,484
Wouldn't hurt me any to have a new kind
of man added to my record, would it?

307
00:20:01,565 --> 00:20:02,554
Goodness me, Miss Lou.

308
00:20:02,965 --> 00:20:04,921
You ain't thinking of reforming, is you?

309
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:07,803
You know,
preachers don't give away no diamonds.

310
00:20:07,885 --> 00:20:10,922
I told you he ain't a preacher,
he just runs the mission next door.

311
00:20:11,005 --> 00:20:13,041
I hear he ain't gonna run that long.

312
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,434
I hear they're gonna take the mission
away from him.

313
00:20:15,525 --> 00:20:17,595
Fella named Jacobson
that owns the building...

314
00:20:17,685 --> 00:20:19,403
I hear they can't pay the rent.

315
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:21,203
Seems to me you've been hearing things.

316
00:20:21,285 --> 00:20:22,274
[Knocking at door]

317
00:20:22,365 --> 00:20:24,242
PEARL: Who's that?
SPIDER: Spider Kane.

318
00:20:24,325 --> 00:20:26,077
In a minute, Spider.

319
00:20:27,005 --> 00:20:29,803
PEARL: Miss Lou'll be here in a minute.
SPIDER: Thanks, Pearl.

320
00:20:29,885 --> 00:20:31,921
LOU: Come in, Spider, sit down.

321
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,323
LOU: What's on your mind?

322
00:20:34,645 --> 00:20:36,601
I want to talk to you about something.

323
00:20:36,685 --> 00:20:39,882
- Nothing serious, I hope.
- Not exactly, Lou.

324
00:20:40,325 --> 00:20:42,555
Well, yeah, maybe in a way, it is.

325
00:20:42,645 --> 00:20:46,354
Spill it. I ain't afraid. My conscience is clear.

326
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,003
Leastwise, I think it is.

327
00:20:48,085 --> 00:20:51,316
SPIDER: What I've got to say
is about Chick Clark.

328
00:20:52,165 --> 00:20:53,484
Chick Clark?

329
00:20:53,565 --> 00:20:56,204
I'm wondering if you ain't sort of forgetting
about him.

330
00:20:56,285 --> 00:20:59,834
I've gotta admit it's been a long time
since I've seen Chick...

331
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,439
but I ain't never completely forgot about him.

332
00:21:02,525 --> 00:21:05,517
SPIDER: He's been in a year now, Lou.
LOU: Yeah, I know.

333
00:21:05,805 --> 00:21:09,354
You know how he took his rap, quiet like.
Same as we all would.

334
00:21:09,765 --> 00:21:13,075
It was tough he got caught,
but it wasn't my fault.

335
00:21:13,845 --> 00:21:16,803
I ain't the sentimental kind, Spider.

336
00:21:16,885 --> 00:21:20,878
Sure, but remember,
you said you'd be, well...

337
00:21:21,045 --> 00:21:23,115
waiting around for him whenever he gets out.

338
00:21:23,205 --> 00:21:26,163
Gets out? That's gonna be a long time.

339
00:21:26,245 --> 00:21:28,395
What I want to say is...

340
00:21:28,485 --> 00:21:31,921
supposing he found out
you ain't exactly been waiting.

341
00:21:32,405 --> 00:21:34,555
I gotta do something while I'm waiting,
don't I?

342
00:21:34,645 --> 00:21:38,399
Chick wouldn't figure it that way.
Suppose he found out about Jordan?

343
00:21:38,885 --> 00:21:42,036
- What are you trying to tell me?
- Go up and see him, Lou.

344
00:21:42,285 --> 00:21:44,879
What for? And antagonise Gus?

345
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:48,515
If I start going up there,
Gus'll think I'm still caring for Chick.

346
00:21:48,605 --> 00:21:52,200
Not that I don't like him a lot.
I ain't got no complaint.

347
00:21:52,485 --> 00:21:55,921
- Chick was a good man. In his way.
- He's in love with you, Lou.

348
00:21:56,005 --> 00:21:59,634
And being in the clink a year without the girl
what makes you feel that way...

349
00:21:59,725 --> 00:22:01,283
ain't no picnic.

350
00:22:01,965 --> 00:22:04,843
I wish he'd forget me,
but the guy is a memory expert.

351
00:22:04,925 --> 00:22:08,440
Go up to pacify him, Lou.
Make him think everything is all right.

352
00:22:08,525 --> 00:22:11,722
Chick is pretty bad when he wants to be.

353
00:22:12,245 --> 00:22:14,236
You don't want him feeding you bullets.

354
00:22:14,325 --> 00:22:17,715
I don't exactly want to be dodging around
in tin corsets.

355
00:22:17,805 --> 00:22:19,796
How's about it us going up
to see him tomorrow?

356
00:22:19,885 --> 00:22:21,318
Why tomorrow?

357
00:22:21,405 --> 00:22:23,873
Me laundry will be back then.

358
00:22:24,325 --> 00:22:27,442
- Make it Sunday. It'll be nice and quiet.
- That's fine, Lou.

359
00:22:27,525 --> 00:22:30,119
It'll be a swell trip.
We can take the boat up the Hudson.

360
00:22:30,205 --> 00:22:32,196
I'll take the train. Water and me don't agree.

361
00:22:32,285 --> 00:22:33,320
SPIDER: All right.

362
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:42,234
- Wait a minute.
- Please don't tell them I'm here, Captain.

363
00:22:42,325 --> 00:22:44,885
- Captain, will you help me?
- What's the matter, Pete?

364
00:22:44,965 --> 00:22:47,559
There was a window broken
down at Flaherty's drug store.

365
00:22:47,645 --> 00:22:49,761
PETE: I didn't mean to do it.
DOHENEY: Where is he?

366
00:22:49,845 --> 00:22:51,881
DOHENEY: Which way did he go?
PETE: That's Doheney.

367
00:22:51,965 --> 00:22:55,196
- Don't let him get me, Captain.
- Get up there and stay quiet.

368
00:23:00,205 --> 00:23:02,844
- Where is he?
- Who?

369
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:06,600
Don't try to fool me. I know you're
always trying to help these dirty crooks.

370
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,279
Now where did he go?
Where did you put him?

371
00:23:09,685 --> 00:23:13,041
- Who do you mean?
- Pete the Duke, you know who I mean.

372
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:16,083
You must be mistaken.
Pete's been helping me all afternoon.

373
00:23:16,165 --> 00:23:18,121
- Who says so?
- I do.

374
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:21,199
Two against one, Doheney,
so flap your heels.

375
00:23:21,285 --> 00:23:23,674
JORDAN: What's the matter here?
You're in again?

376
00:23:23,765 --> 00:23:27,075
Listen, Jordan, I'm after Pete the Duke,
I saw him come in the door...

377
00:23:27,165 --> 00:23:30,555
Just a minute, Doheney. I thought I told you
you weren't welcome here.

378
00:23:30,645 --> 00:23:34,433
What's the use of stalling me?
I saw him come in the door...

379
00:23:37,525 --> 00:23:38,719
CUMMINGS: Thanks.

380
00:23:39,325 --> 00:23:41,122
Ain't having much luck, are you?

381
00:23:41,205 --> 00:23:44,481
I'd have a great deal more
if Doheney and the others would cooperate.

382
00:23:44,565 --> 00:23:46,317
Ain't none of them worth saving.

383
00:23:46,405 --> 00:23:49,477
If you hang around them long enough,
you'll get that way yourself.

384
00:23:49,565 --> 00:23:51,283
Thanks for the kind interest.

385
00:23:51,365 --> 00:23:54,675
I always did like a man in a uniform.

386
00:23:54,765 --> 00:23:56,721
That one fits you grand.

387
00:23:57,085 --> 00:23:59,474
Why don't you come up sometime
and see me?

388
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:03,524
- I'm home every evening.
- Yeah, but I'm busy every evening.

389
00:24:03,605 --> 00:24:06,597
Busy? Say, what are you trying to do,
insult me?

390
00:24:06,685 --> 00:24:09,677
Why, no, not at all. I'm just busy, that's all.

391
00:24:09,765 --> 00:24:13,041
You see, we're holding meetings
in Jacobson's hall every evening.

392
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:16,356
When you have a moment to spare, drop in.
You're more than welcome.

393
00:24:16,445 --> 00:24:19,323
I heard you. But you ain't kidding me any.

394
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:24,003
You know, I met your kind before.
Why don't you come up sometime?

395
00:24:24,085 --> 00:24:25,154
CUMMINGS: Well, I...

396
00:24:25,245 --> 00:24:27,998
- Don't be afraid. I won't tell.
- But...

397
00:24:28,085 --> 00:24:30,394
Come up. I'll tell your fortune.

398
00:24:30,925 --> 00:24:32,643
You can be had.

399
00:24:38,725 --> 00:24:41,285
Remember, Lou.
Chick's probably pretty sore.

400
00:24:41,365 --> 00:24:43,242
I'll make him think he's on a vacation.

401
00:24:43,325 --> 00:24:45,919
- Yeah, he'll listen to you.
- Who won't?

402
00:24:46,005 --> 00:24:48,200
Once I get them, they're branded.

403
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:55,643
Hello, Shorty, what are you doing here?

404
00:24:55,725 --> 00:24:57,477
SHORTY: Five years.
LOU: What for?

405
00:24:57,925 --> 00:25:00,519
I forgot what me mother told me.

406
00:25:00,605 --> 00:25:03,165
Should have tied a string around your finger.

407
00:25:03,245 --> 00:25:05,918
BOBO: Hello, Lou.
LOU: Bobo, I didn't expect to see you here.

408
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:08,758
BOBO: If you hadn't turned me down
I'd have never landed in here.

409
00:25:08,845 --> 00:25:11,757
Say, Lou, how about giving me
another chance when I get out?

410
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:14,040
LOU: When do you get out?
BOBO: 15 years.

411
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:15,604
That's a date.

412
00:25:17,165 --> 00:25:18,564
Hello, Lou.

413
00:25:19,045 --> 00:25:20,080
Cherry sisters.

414
00:25:20,165 --> 00:25:22,395
CONVICT 1: Lou, you gotta help me
get out of this.

415
00:25:22,485 --> 00:25:24,635
- Who, me?
- You've gotta. I've been framed.

416
00:25:24,725 --> 00:25:28,001
You got a lot of pull. You can get me out,
It's a frame, I tell you.

417
00:25:28,085 --> 00:25:29,723
You're the right picture for it.

418
00:25:29,805 --> 00:25:33,036
One of the fastest guys in the business,
but he's taking his time now.

419
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:34,399
CONVICTS 2 AND 3: Hello, Lou.

420
00:25:34,485 --> 00:25:36,635
What is this? Old Home Week?

421
00:25:42,565 --> 00:25:43,714
Chick.

422
00:25:44,245 --> 00:25:46,805
Why didn't you come to see me sooner?

423
00:25:47,525 --> 00:25:50,801
- 'Cause you were glad to get rid of me?
- Chick.

424
00:25:50,885 --> 00:25:54,321
You know what I mean and you know me.
What am I in here for?

425
00:25:54,405 --> 00:25:57,920
You know why I copped them stones?
Sure, and you know who's got them now.

426
00:25:58,365 --> 00:26:01,243
You'd sell your heart and lungs
for a handful of diamonds.

427
00:26:01,325 --> 00:26:04,283
And I'm doing a stretch with rats and bugs
so you can have them.

428
00:26:04,365 --> 00:26:05,798
It's all right.

429
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:09,396
As long as you're on the level.
But if you ain't, I can find out.

430
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:11,953
Don't forget that. I can find out.

431
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:14,684
And I can get out.

432
00:26:14,765 --> 00:26:17,484
CHICK: If you've been double-crossing me,
you'll pay for it.

433
00:26:17,565 --> 00:26:21,558
CHICK: Every day, every minute
of this stretch, you're gonna pay for.

434
00:26:22,405 --> 00:26:25,124
Don't talk like that, Chick. I've been working.

435
00:26:25,205 --> 00:26:27,594
Working? Working who?

436
00:26:28,485 --> 00:26:30,396
Singing at Gus Jordan's.

437
00:26:31,605 --> 00:26:34,438
- Gus Jordan's?
- It ain't what you think.

438
00:26:35,245 --> 00:26:38,123
You haven't been seeing
anything of Dan Flynn, have you?

439
00:26:38,205 --> 00:26:40,400
No, why do you ask about him?

440
00:26:40,485 --> 00:26:43,397
Nothing. Just got a score...

441
00:26:44,365 --> 00:26:46,083
to settle up with him when I get out.

442
00:26:46,165 --> 00:26:49,714
CHICK: What I want to know is are you
playing me on the square or ain't you...

443
00:26:49,805 --> 00:26:52,877
- because if you ain't...
- There'll be a death in my family?

444
00:26:52,965 --> 00:26:54,717
CHICK: No.
LOU: Is that it?

445
00:26:55,445 --> 00:26:57,640
Then I'll be back in here again.

446
00:26:58,165 --> 00:27:00,963
But you won't be coming around to see me.

447
00:27:01,925 --> 00:27:04,962
What's the use of making
a lot of trouble for yourself, Chick?

448
00:27:05,045 --> 00:27:08,276
If I can wait a year, you can wait a year.

449
00:27:09,405 --> 00:27:11,236
You mean that you'll wait for me?

450
00:27:11,325 --> 00:27:14,840
Why, that ain't nothing
when you got willpower like me.

451
00:27:15,165 --> 00:27:17,759
- Time's up.
- Have a heart.

452
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:20,803
They ain't seen each other in a year.
Give them time.

453
00:27:20,885 --> 00:27:22,477
What for? Ready?

454
00:27:23,165 --> 00:27:26,202
Goodbye, Chick.
It's been good to see you again.

455
00:27:26,405 --> 00:27:28,316
I can't let you go, Lou.

456
00:27:28,685 --> 00:27:30,437
I hate to leave you.

457
00:27:31,325 --> 00:27:33,634
Don't worry. I'll be true to you.

458
00:27:33,845 --> 00:27:37,394
I trust you. I trust you because I love you.
You're mine.

459
00:27:37,525 --> 00:27:40,085
I'm telling you again,
if you ever double-cross me...

460
00:27:40,165 --> 00:27:42,474
if you ever let another man
come between us...

461
00:27:42,565 --> 00:27:43,998
I'll kill you.

462
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:47,715
Goodbye, Chick.
I'll remember to be good for you.

463
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:57,162
I can't wait.

464
00:28:05,805 --> 00:28:07,955
I wonder what Chick's got
against Dan Flynn?

465
00:28:08,045 --> 00:28:09,444
I ain't never told you, Lou...

466
00:28:09,525 --> 00:28:12,119
but Flynn is the main guy
what helped send Chick up here.

467
00:28:12,205 --> 00:28:14,924
I ain't never had no use
for that mug ever since.

468
00:28:15,005 --> 00:28:17,565
- So Flynn did that?
- Yeah.

- Is that all?
- Yes, sir, that's all.

822
00:51:57,005 --> 00:51:59,360
What this young lady says
is a serious accusation...

823
00:51:59,445 --> 00:52:03,961

and coincides with Dan Flynn's report.

826
00:52:13,645 --> 00:52:17,604
Now, Sally, tell the District Attorney
exactly what you told me.

827
00:52:18,925 --> 00:52:23,521
Lou, what did Cummings want?
I seen him go upstairs to your room.

828
00:52:23,605 --> 00:52:26,995
He wanted to know about that Sally girl
you sent to the coast.

829
00:52:27,085 --> 00:52:28,996
He did? Wonder what for.

830
00:52:29,165 --> 00:52:32,157
The father was over at the mission
and wanted them to find her.

831
00:52:32,245 --> 00:52:34,759
All I told him was that you got her a job.

832
00:52:35,245 --> 00:52:37,679
I'm sorry I ever bothered with that girl.

833
00:52:37,845 --> 00:52:39,437
Why are you so funny-acting, Gus?

834
00:52:39,525 --> 00:52:41,993
Funny-acting? What do you mean?

835
00:52:43,005 --> 00:52:46,918
You're acting kind of funny.
Have I done anything you don't like?

836
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:49,679
No. Not exactly.

837
00:52:50,685 --> 00:52:54,678
I tell you, Lou. I don't like this bird Stanieff
always hanging around you.

838
00:52:54,765 --> 00:52:58,314
He's too sleek, too slippery.
Too polite to suit me.

839
00:52:58,885 --> 00:53:03,083
So that's what's biting you.
Why, he don't mean nothing to me.

840
00:53:03,245 --> 00:53:06,123
He's Rita's friend.
I wanted to make him feel at home.

841
00:53:06,205 --> 00:53:07,843
Yeah? All right.

842
00:53:08,925 --> 00:53:10,916
I guess I'm a jealous old fool.

843
00:53:11,725 --> 00:53:13,955
They are valuable, ain't they, Gus?

844
00:53:14,245 --> 00:53:16,395
Worth pretty nearly half a million.

845
00:53:17,205 --> 00:53:19,639
Gonna get you a lot more of them soon.

846
00:53:21,085 --> 00:53:23,076
He said they had no soul.

847
00:53:23,925 --> 00:53:25,199
Who said?

848
00:53:29,645 --> 00:53:31,078
That guy, Cummings.

849
00:53:32,605 --> 00:53:34,914
So, you met a man who wouldn't fall for you?

850
00:53:35,005 --> 00:53:36,802
Who wants him to fall?

851
00:53:36,885 --> 00:53:40,241
Why, he'd be the kind
a woman'd have to marry to get rid of.

852
00:53:40,845 --> 00:53:43,154
That sounds more like Dan Flynn.

853
00:53:43,925 --> 00:53:47,520
You ain't heard anything about this copper
they call the Hawk, have you?

854

855
00:53:49,805 --> 00:53:52,160
Flynn says he's spotting the place
day and night.

856
00:53:52,245 --> 00:53:55,396
Flynn said that? What does he know?

857
00:53:55,645 --> 00:53:57,954
I hope you ain't sending them girls
to the coast...

858
00:53:58,045 --> 00:54:01,401

like Flynn thinks.

859

Something I had to do,
and didn't have the time to do it...

863
00:54:14,765 --> 00:54:16,756
and Spider did it for me.

864
00:54:19,565 --> 00:54:23,717
Boss, there's a guy out here named McNeil,
he wants to cash a cheque.

Rita? Why, no.

868
00:54:32,885 --> 00:54:34,841
