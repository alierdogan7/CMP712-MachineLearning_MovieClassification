1
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,288
Psst!

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,255
I am so glad you are here.
We have precious little time.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,656
I need you to perform
a task of unimaginable danger.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,489
I believe you are the only man who can do it.
Do you accept?

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,613
-What are the hours?
-It will take the rest of your life and beyond.

6
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,813
All right, I haven't got much on.

7
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,454
Take this. It is a sacred amulet.

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,937
If that falls into the hands of our enemies,
this planet will be doomed.

9
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,255
You must take it away and hide it.

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,656
-Who are you anyway?
-It is I, the King.

11
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,175
Cool. I'll just nip home and get a couple of bits.

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,420
No, we have no time.
You must go far away to a planet called Earth.

13
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,973
How will I get there?

14
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,058
Press the button in the amulet,
it will take you there.

15
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,537
-Cheers, King. I'll never forget you.
-And I will never forget you, Banoo.

16
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,218
-It's Naboo, actually.
-What?

17
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,571
I came as quickly as I could. My liege.
I have trained for over 30 years for this task.

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,897
I'm the fittest, the strongest,
the fastest warrior in all the land.

19
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,418
With me the amulet will be safe.
I am your humble servant, Banoo.

20
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,249
Shit!

21
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,775
Come with us now
on a journey through time and space...

22
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,619
...to the world of The Mighty Boosh.

23
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,416
# The Mighty Boosh
# Come with us to the Mighty Boosh

24
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,530
# The Mighty Boosh
# Come with us to the Mighty Boosh #

25
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,411
-Cup of tea?
-What's the point?

26
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,691
Come on, we've had worse gigs than that,
you know. Just a tough crowd.

27
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,618
You heard what they were saying,
''Why did you bring your dad on stage?''

28
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,378
They could've been talking about the soundman.

29
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,936
They were talking about me and you know it.
''Who's that? Your science teacher?''

30
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,415
Well, you've always been more mature than me,
you know.

31
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,294
-We're the same age!
-I know. It was always like that, even at school.

32
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,498
(WHISPERING) Hey, Vince,
I don't know what I'm doing.

33
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,015
Cheers.

34
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,654
-Oi, Vince, is that your dad?
-No!

35
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,977
-We're the same age!
-Come on, Howard, let's get out of here.

36
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,653
I've always been big-boned.

37
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,375
Exactly. People love that about you, you know.
You know what people call you?

38
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,331
-What?
-The Buffalo man.

39
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,570
What's a big old buffalo doing trying to make it
in a band?

40
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,931
It's a young man's game.
I've already got four crow's-feet.

41
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,257
-Maybe I should get a face-lift.
-Well, that is an option.

42
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,219
It's a drastic one, though.
There's other things you could do first.

43
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,457
-Like what?
-Well, I mean your outfit. What's going on there?

44
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:58,257
-This is my look. A good look, a strong look.
-Yeah, for Magnum, p.i. maybe. Hawaiian shorts?

45
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,736
Yeah. My legs are my best feature.
I've been told they're slim and youthful.

46
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,215
They're not going to get you
on the cover of NME though, are they?

47
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,810
Don't be knocking the pegs, okay?
These babies have turned heads in their time.

48
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,374
Look, Howard, I think you're going
to have to learn to accessorise.

49
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,219
-What?
-Well, you know, gloves, belts, badges.

50
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,490
You can really breathe new life into an outfit.

51
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,180
I don't accessorise. I'm Howard Moon.

52
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,459
There's a simple truth to me.
I don't have to adorn myself in trinkets.

53
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,899
Whatever.

54
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,135
# Time is calling out my name

55
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,579
# Howard

56
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,931
# Playing the final rules of this game

57
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,694
# Chess

58
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,415
# All my hopes and dreams have turned to dust

59
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,249
# The armour of my youth gone to rust #

60
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,338
-What's up with him?
-He's having an age crisis.

61
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:51,056
-Well, it is all about youth these days.
-I know. How old are you?

62
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,614
-Real age or press age?
-Real age.

63
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,497
I am 40. But because I am DJ, I say 29.

64
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,895
Nice.

65
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,579
-What about Naboo?
-He 406.

66
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,976
-No way! He looks about 1 2.
-Yeah.

67
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,216
What's his secret? Oil of Ulay I bet.

68
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,251
-He has different secret.
-Oh, yeah?

69
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,179
Yeah, he has access to Fountain of Youth.

70
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,689
-He must have hidden it somewhere.
-Imagine if we find it, it will be genius.

71
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,449
-Our old brains encased in tight youthful faces.
-Where is it?

72
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,890
-I've got something. There's a map here.
-I'll take that.

73
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,056
-I'm the cartographer around here.
-I found it.

74
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,330
There's something for you.
That's more your style, isn't it?

75
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,018
-Nice and shiny.
-Cool.

76
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,055
''To find the Fountain of Youth
you must first reach the Desert of Nightmares.''

77
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,850
-What did you say?
-If only we could find the Desert of Nightmares.

78
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,208
Check this out.

79
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,289
Do you think Naboo will mind us borrowing this
for a while?

80
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,819
-No.
-Come on.

81
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,138
-Let's get ourselves some youth juice.
-Yeah.

82
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,493
-I don't believe it. We've gone round in circles.
-I've read about this.

83
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,656
If you're walking in the desert
and there's no landmarks

84
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,329
and you've got one leg shorter than the other,
you just go round in circles.

85
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,372
-What are you saying about my legs?
-I'm not saying anything about your legs.

86
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,331
You're always having a poke at my legs,
aren't you?

87
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,928
I'm not talking about your....
Well, they are quite funny.

88
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,130
There's nothing funny about my legs.

89
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:52,015
-They're like hosepipes propping up a beanbag.
-That's my look, okay? You're just jealous.

90
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:56,611
You only dream of having legs like mine.
Willowy and sleek like the antelope.

91
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,571
(CHUCKLING) Whatever.

92
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,134
Tell you, this Factor 3000 is genius.

93
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,048
It's tested out on Goths and albinos.
It's part of the Edgar Winter range.

94
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,932
Yeah, well, give me some.

95
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,530
-There's none left.
-Oh, sorry about that.

96
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,298
Oh, great. I'm going to burn up.

97
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,570
You'll be all right.
You look good with a tan, you know.

98
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,498
I need to be pale. It's part of my look.
I'm the Shoreditch vampire.

99
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,134
I've got sensitive skin, okay.
Do you remember why we came here?

100
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,251
I've got four crow's-feet as it is.

101
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,938
-Five, actually.
-What do you mean?

102
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,528
-I've just seen one appear under your eye.
-Don't be joking now.

103
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,059
-There's another one.
-Stop it!

104
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,215
-Six.
-Shut up!

105
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,375
-Seven.
-Stop it.

106
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,570
-They're coming thick and fast.
-This isn't funny, okay?

107
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,976
Halt!
What brings you to the Desert of Nightmares?

108
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,376
-Actually, we're looking for the Fountain of Youth.
-We're just passing through.

109
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,579
Ah! Many a vain man
has come searching for the Fountain of Youth.

110
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,339
And many a vain man has been killed.

111
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,412
-Why?
-Because I have killed them.

112
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,256
-Yeah, right. You and whose army?
-Me and my army.

113
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,018
Kashungo!

114
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,978
Check us out!

115
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,293
I don't believe this.
They've been going through my stuff again.

116
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,695
Probably looking for Fountain of Youth.

117
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,015
Really?
And why would they be looking for that, Bollo?

118
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,813
-I don't know.
-Have you been yapping off again?

119
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,896
Bollo need to go now.

120
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,375
They've taken the amulet.
We've got to go and find them.

121
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,456
Where they go?

122
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,538
To a place far, far away.

123
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,376
A place where I was born.

124
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,936
-Streatham?
-No, the planet Xooberon, you jerk off.

125
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,493
Oh, Xooberon. Oh, yeah.

126
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,291
(HUSHED CONVERSATION)

127
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,137
We have reached a verdict.

128
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:49,095
You shall be buried up to your necks in sand.
Left in the midday sun to be cooked alive.

129
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,938
Have you anything to say?

130
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,415
-Have you got the amulet?
-Yeah, shall we get out of here?

131
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,337
-One minute.
-What are you doing?

132
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,974
-Yeah, I've got something to say, actually.
-Oh, really?

133
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,012
Yeah, I was just wondering why
you were doing all this sort of stuff.

134
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:06,089
Is it now, and I'm going out on a limb here,
because you're a little bit short?

135
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,331
I'm not short, am I?

136
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,498
See. I'm a big 'un.

137
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,815
Come on,
they're just kneeling down to make you look taller.

138
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,738
-I am taller than most things.
-Like what?

139
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,855
Chairs. Beach balls. Women on their sides.

140
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,175
You're technically a midget.
I'm sorry to break it to you.

141
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,655
I am four foot six without shoeses.

142
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,136
With the hat, maybe.
Is that why you wear it? To give you a little boost?

143
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,659
This is all me.

144
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,171
Who looks foolish now?

145
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,815
You, you blue berk.
What's that comb-over all about?

146
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,170
That's not disguising the size of your head,
you know.

147
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,258
Oh, I'm going to beat you
within an inch of your life.

148
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,019
-What with? Your forehead?
-Zantar!

149
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,371
Press it now. Press it now, Vince!

150
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,650
-It's not working.
-What do you mean it's not working?

151
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,611
-I think the batteries have run out.
-What do you mean?

152
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,731
-The batteries are dead.
-What batteries?

153
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,174
(GRUNTING)

154
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,775
Yes, good, Zantar. There'll be snacks for you later.

155
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,131
Zantar. A little on the short side
but he packs a wallop.

156
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,332
Behold! He has the amulet. All hail our new leader.

157
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,410
(CHANTING)

158
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,690
Yeah, right. You didn't quite realise
who you were messing with, did you?

159
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,776
You don't have the amulet.

160
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,853
-Can't you get any closer?
-I'm trying, boss.

161
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,575
-Oh, it's not crashed again, has it?
-No, the mouse is stuck.

162
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,616
Zoom in on that bird with the big hair.

163
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,653
Right click, right click. Zoom.

164
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,211
Halle-bleeding-lujah. I knew it, boy.

165
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:08,174
I had a strange feeling in the pit of my stomach
this morning when I woke up.

166
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,293
At first I thought it was the crabsticks,
but now it all makes sense.

167
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,173
The amulet, it's come back at last!

168
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:20,135
When I get that amulet and get
to the Fountain of Youth, I'll rule the universe.

169
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:26,130
With an army of green bitches marching
and destroying everything in their cockney wake.

170
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,693
I love you, boss.

171
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,574
-Shut up and put the tea on.
-All right. How about some malt loaf?

172
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,850
-Yeah, I'll have a slice.
-Right.

173
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,733
Apples and pears and various other fruit.

174
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,253
VINCE: Yeah, so basically, I backcomb it.
I rarely wash it.

175
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,177
It just stays like this all day.

176
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,860
Bravissimo! Remarkable!

177
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,536
-Could you sign this for my wife?
-Yeah.

178
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,537
Make it out to Alan.

179
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,935
Can I have some space? I'm getting a bit claustra.

180
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,620
Give our master some space, you pig dogs.

181
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,819
Can I get you anything else,
my little plum dumpling?

182
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,532
Well, I am quite thirsty.

183
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,810
Slave! Water! Now!

184
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,620
-Nice shorts.
-I'm not happy about this, you know.

185
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,980
How dare you speak
in the presence of the Chosen One!

186
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,897
Chosen One?

187
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,932
-I've already told you.
-Will you stop doing that?

188
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,539
You're not listening. Shall I kill him?

189
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,493
Erm...

190
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,737
no, don't kill him.
Let me have a word with him in private.

191
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,931
Everyone out, you little dick bags.

192
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,575
I can stay, of course,
because I'm the favourite of the Chosen One.

193
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,973
-Oh, my dear sweet gorgeous lord.
-What you doing?

194
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,618
Oh, I've crossed the line. Forgive me.

195
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,578
I shall cut off my hand.

196
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,135
Oh, this is bad! God!

197
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,089
No!

198
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,017
God, it hurts so good.

199
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,018
Listen, we've got to get out of here
and get some batteries for that amulet.

200
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,290
Where are we going to get those from?
The local Dixons?

201
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,980
I don't know where to get them from
but we can't get home without them.

202
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,931
-What's the rush?
-What do you mean, what's the rush?

203
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,177
-We're being held captive by a violent dwarf.
-I'm not.

204
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,975
Look, you remember why we came here, yeah?
To find the Fountain of Youth.

205
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,453
Yeah, but that was before.

206
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,612
-Before what?
-Before I found out I was the Chosen One.

207
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,450
Vince, you've gone wrong.

208
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,936
-I've always felt like I might be the Chosen One.
-What?

209
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,654
Do you believe in fate, Howard?
I mean, I was wearing the amulet.

210
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,975
Well, maybe I should wear
that amulet for a little bit, yeah?

211
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,137
You don't accessorise.
There's a simple truth to you.

212
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,569
-You bitch. Give me that amulet.
-Guards.

213
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,973
-What shall we do with him?
-Just get him out of my sight.

214
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,738
Very well, cupcake.

215
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,650
# Shooting star, look at you

216
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:08,058
# Shooting star, you're a beautiful ball of light

217
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,498
# Shooting star

218
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,692
# Get out of the way
I can't see nothin'

219
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,050
# You're all in my periferins

220
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,375
# You're in my periferins visual

221
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,976
# I cannot, how can I concentrate?

222
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,773
# You're all over like a bluebottle

223
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,972
# Getting in
Getting in all about the place #

224
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,219
Flipping idiot.

225
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,214
Sandstorm! Sandstorm!

226
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:43,368
Sandstorm! Sandstorm! Storm of sand. Sandstorm.

227
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,139
Can you keep it down a bit?
I'm trying to straighten my hair.

228
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,659
Run for your lives.

229
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,377
What's happening? Where's everyone going?

230
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,650
-This is your first test.
-What test?

231
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,329
It is written that the Chosen One
must destroy the evil sand beast

232
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,418
that has cursed our tribe
for hundreds of tens of years.

233
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,017
Unless, perhaps, you are not the Chosen One.

234
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,692
No, no, he is the Chosen One. Good luck.

235
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,290
Good luck, my lovely lady lumps. Bye.

236
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,568
-I am Sandstorm.
-I'm Vince.

237
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,219
Pleased to meet you.

238
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,534
Ow!

239
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,732
Feel the power of my grade 4 glasspaper palms.

240
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,088
Na, na!

241
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,131
That hurt, you bumbaclot.

242
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,889
That's just the beginning.
I plan to sand you down to a pulp, cowboy.

243
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,938
-Why?
-What? I am Sandstorm.

244
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,776
-Yeah? So what?
-Stop the talk, prepare for a chaffing.

245
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,739
-There's something wrong with you.
-No, there isn't.

246
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,135
-You're all angry.
-Yes, I am angry.

247
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,012
You've got no charm or charisma.

248
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,257
There's nothing to you.
You're just violence in a tool belt.

249
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,258
-Who are you to judge me? I am frustrated.
-Why?

250
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,656
Because I cannot love. It's a living hell for me.

251
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,099
-What is?
-My life.

252
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,859
-I'm made from sandpaper.
-Yeah, I'm getting that.

253
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,529
I can't touch anything. If I do, I wear it down.

254
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,295
I plane surfaces without realising it.

255
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,251
I cannot even touch myself.

256
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,938
I'm having a bit of a shocker.

257
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,329
Hmm.

258
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,372
-Well, have you thought about accessorising?
-What?

259
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,536
Well, you know, what about some gloves?

260
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,618
-Gloves? What is gloves?
-Take these.

261
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,254
-They go over your hands.
-Oh.

262
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,015
Ah!

263
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,928
Hand sheaths.

264
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,689
Never before have I felt
the soft contours of my face.

265
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:56,371
Never have I lightly caressed
the angular frame that is my torso.

266
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,617
Oh, this is great. Now I can love myself.

267
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,899
(RUSTLING)

268
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,139
Oh, my.

269
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,458
Oh, love, love.

270
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,494
Love, love.

271
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,939
Oh, love, love.

272
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,094
(MOANING)

273
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,213
Can I keep these?

274
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,137
-Yeah.
-Oh, thank you.

275
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,457
-No one's ever given me a gift before.
-That's fine.

276
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:25,096
If ever you need help, general DIY or....
I'm very good with coving.

277
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,770
Simply blow this horn
and I shall repay your kindness. Bye.

278
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,369
See you later.

279
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,338
Saturn, Jupiter, Pluto,

280
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,411
Mars, Venus,

281
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,334
George, Gracie.

282
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,776
That is the list of my best friends in order.

283
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,692
Order of preference.

284
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,691
# I love the Chosen One

285
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,651
# Loving him is lots of fun

286
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,577
# We love the Chosen One

287
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,452
# Not as much as me

288
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,457
# I love him with my heart

289
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,571
# I love him with my body parts

290
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,531
# We love the Chosen One

291
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,218
# Everybody shush! #

292
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,138
There, it is decided. I love the Chosen One most.

293
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,491
And in appreciation of your killing
the evil sand beast,

294
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,259
I present you with this gift.

295
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,813
Wow, thanks a lot.

296
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,971
-Cheers.
-It took me ages to wrap.

297
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,250
Have you got anything else? I do like gifts.

298
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,177
Oh, yes. Pepo!

299
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,415
Ow!

300
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,656
-Pepo, come over here.
-All right, Pepo?

301
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,578
Pepo is the greatest artist
our race has ever produced.

302
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,009
He has been watching you ever since you arrived.

303
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,691
I hope you don't mind, but I think this is
the best piece of work I've ever done.

304
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,932
That is cool.

305
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,652
It must have taken you ages. It's so perfect.

306
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,893
-I mean, the fringe is a bit short.
-Forgive me, my lord.

307
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,577
I just meant you could probably redo the fringe.

308
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,614
Oh, yeah.

309
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,496
Okay. Music.

310
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,616
# I love the Chosen One

311
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,651
# Loving him is fun, fun, fun

312
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,498
# I love the Chosen One

313
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,292
# Not as much as me

314
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,536
# I love the Chosen One

315
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,491
# Loving him is so much fun

316
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,372
# We love the Chosen One

317
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,331
# Not as much as me.... #

318
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,336
Why do you not join in the festivities?

319
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,449
-It's not really my scene.
-Nor mine.

320
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,891
He is not the chosen one.

321
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,258
-What do you mean?
-You are.

322
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:55,135
Am I? I mean, I am but.... How did you know that?

323
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,575
I've been watching you in your shorts.

324
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:02,378
You are a powerful man with slim handsome legs.

325
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,617
-You noticed?
-How could I fail to?

326
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,539
Such legs.

327
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:10,336
I know why you are here.
You seek the Fountain of Youth.

328
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,779
How do you know that?

329
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:16,416
I also know your so-called friend Vince
plans to ditch you and get it himself,

330
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,338
and form a band with younger people.

331
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,970
-What?
-Yes, he's drunk on power.

332
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,613
But I see something special in your eyes, Howard.

333
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,050
-You should have the amulet.
-Yes. How?

334
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,130
-You are his personal slave, are you not?
-More of a valet, but yes.

335
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,218
-You fold his clothes, peel his grapes.
-Yeah.

336
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,853
Wash his balls.

337
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,768
I draw the line at that, but I do deal
with some of his more personal business.

338
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,978
-And you have access to his tent?
-I do.

339
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,379
(WHISPERING)

340
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,778
-I can't hear that.
-Oh, sorry.

341
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,178
Basically, you go into his tent when he is asleep,
you open the flap, you steal the amulet....

342
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,495
Psst.

343
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,973
Oh, hi.

344
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,018
-You have the amulet?
-Yeah, yeah, he was sleeping like a baby.

345
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,859
-Never mind, give me the amulet.
-Oh, yeah.

346
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,450
Maybe when this whole thing is over
we could go out for meal.

347
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,093
Do you like Chinese food?

348
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,652
I don't think so, squire.

350
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,050
Where am I? What's happening?

351
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,490
Someone stole the amulet last night
while I was asleep.

352
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,453
Oh. Who would do something like that?

353
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,933
Silence!

354
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,211
You have lost the amulet.
Our most valuable of jewels.

355
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,251
And now you must pay the price.

356
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,259
By midday you will be two burning balls of fire.

357
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,173
Now make peace with your gods.

358
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,291

would it?

-No.

-A passing coyote took pity on me.

He took pity on you, did he? He took a piss on me.

he was probably just trying to cool you down.

it will restore me to my former glory.
