00:00:30,002 --> 00:00:36,490
I think U need Subtitles  :)

4
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:23,186
Man has to face many storms in life.

5
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:28,826
But this orphan has
to face another storm.

6
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:36,101
And that is his
helplessness, his weakness.

7
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:38,265
And sense of loneliness.

8
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:44,306
What are you doing here by yourself?

9
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:50,816
Somebody definitely comes
to meet or take home all the kids.

10
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,716
But nobody comes to meet me
or to take me home.

11
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,585
Don't l have anyone in this world?

12
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:01,924
Yes, my son. Those who have nobody...

13
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,727
He belongs to them.

14
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:58,482
- Pass the ball.
- He's lame. He can't.

15
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:02,753
You cripple! Can't you hear?
Pass the ball!

16
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,754
Not only deaf is he lame,
he's also deaf!

17
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,661
- He won't understand like this.
- Then how will he?

18
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,531
Now let us see you walk.

19
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,071
l'll show you! Calling him lame?

20
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:35,518
Thank you pal. You helped me
a lot. What's your name?

21
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:39,021
Akash Verma. And yours?

22
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,026
From today Akash and
Aman are friends.

23
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:13,588
See what l have for you.

24
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,626
This looks imported.
Must be expensive.

25
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,394
That's not your concern. You eat it.

26
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,867
- What's in your hand?
- A 10 paise sweet.

27
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:28,103
- Give it to me. l like it.
- What are you doing?

28
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:31,173
That was for me, l ate it.
This is for you so you eat it.

29
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,350
Let go! What are you doing?

30
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,353
You're always up to something!
What if somebody sees you?

31
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,458
So what? l'll ask them for permission

32
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:54,499
Mister Viewer, can l romance my wife?

33
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,499
l've got used to asking for permission

34
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:01,204
First ask you if l could romance
you then your parents to marry you.

35
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:02,704
Then the priest to get us married.

36
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,339
A year later take permission from
our son, put him in the cradle...

37
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,478
And ask can l go to her?

38
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:13,718
When we first met, it felt
as if you didn't have a tongue!

39
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:14,615
l still don't.

40
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:18,020
- Now it's 100 parrots on one side
and you on the other! - Parrots?

41
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:22,860
Who will believe that you are Rajiv
Verma, the owner of Verma Estates?

42
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:24,859
The father of a 12 year old boy.

43
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,898
That reminds me where is our son?

44
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,901
Gone to meet his friend.

45
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,202
Since he found this new friend
he has forgotten his old pal.

46
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:42,411
Dad this is my best friend Aman.

47
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:50,920
Where do you live son?
What do your parents do?

48
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,658
l have nobody.
l live with Father D'mello.

49
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:01,129
No Dad, he's lying!
In this world l am his!

50
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:06,169
lf you love him so do we!

51
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,336
Never say that you have nobody.

52
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,764
Didn't you bring Aman?

53
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:13,369
- He refused to come.
- Refused?

54
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:15,736
Where are you going?

55
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:16,937
Let him go.

56
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:23,114
What we adults couldn't do,
Akash's love will do.

57
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:38,694
- Will you come or not?
- l will.

58
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:11,220
- What's going on?
- l'm looking for a coin l lost.

59
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:14,557
- Acting smart with me?
- Honest. But what are you doing?

60
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,994
He's asking me! l'm looking
for a 50 paise coin l dropped.

61
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,508
What is going on?

62
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,448
He lost 25 paise and l lost 50.
We were looking for them.

63
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,283
Come out. l'll find the coins.

64
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,419
- Let go my ear.
- First get up.

65
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,020
Someday he'll get me thrashed!

66
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:52,629
The kid is bad enough but
the Dad takes the cake!

67
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:54,896
By god! l'm terrible.

68
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,899
l'm getting fired thanks to you!

69
00:09:58,432 --> 00:09:59,901
No, l got fired because of you!

70
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:18,990
Did you alone win all
these cups and shields?

71
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:27,301
What's terrific about it?
It's thanks to your blessings.

72
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:32,403
He is always terrific but ask
your useless son what he has brought.

73
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:36,607
What did l say? l knew
Mummy would ask this question.

74
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:38,573
But l haven't come empty-handed.

75
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,644
lf Aman has brought a cup,
l have brought a plate.

76
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:45,916
- Now answer me!
- See how cheeky you son is!

77
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,284
Aman has brought a cup and he a plate!

78
00:10:54,255 --> 00:10:55,624
Tell her l'm 24 years old!

79
00:10:56,757 --> 00:11:00,397
Forgive him this time. Next time
he does something, beat him not me.

80
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,397
Here's the plate.
Please get some tea.

81
00:11:04,298 --> 00:11:07,169
- You'll never change.
- You'll get me thrashed!

82
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:11,341
- You've spoilt him thoroughly!
- Daddy, your dialogue.

83
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:14,844
Does love spoil anyone?

84
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,546
l love you too. Are you spoilt?

85
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:19,647
The kids are watching. Have shame!

86
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:32,462
The loyal and eflicient workers
of Verma Constructions.

87
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:37,200
Today l introduce you to my sons.

88
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,869
This is Aman.

89
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:49,077
- And this is...
- l am Akash,

90
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,416
- Okay carry on.
- What's left to say?

91
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,453
l forgot what l had to say.

92
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:05,430
You have encourage me so far.

93
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:08,731
To strengthen our foundation.
After today...

94
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,900
Help these boys in the same manner.

95
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,808
This is the oflice of
Varma Constructions.

96
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:24,781
- How is it?
- Very nice but what will l do here?

97
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:29,519
Here's a telephone.
You have fingers.

98
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:33,256
There are girls in town.
Call them up and have fun.

99
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:35,924
Can l really?

100
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,061
What are you doing?

101
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:45,669
l had heard about angels.

102
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:52,712
Never seen them but today l can say
confidently they're just like you.

103
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:54,575
What have we done?

104
00:12:55,376 --> 00:12:59,250
The honor you've given me
by giving me your name...

105
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:04,321
That's a debt that l can never repay.

106
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:07,290
You call our love a debt?

107
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:11,060
Why do you talk of debt,
Ioan, obligations?

108
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:15,131
l've never considered you
any diflerent from Akash.

109
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,932
Of course. You think he's
intelligent while l'm a fool!

110
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:20,869
And that's right. No.

111
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:25,476
We have to attend a party.
But you won't go anywhere.

112
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,849
- Where are you going?
- To meet these.

113
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:37,685
- What's this?
- List of girls.

114
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:39,821
Rita at 12, Sita at 2.

115
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,426
Meeta at 4, and somebody at 6.

116
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,661
And when l return home at $,
my Dad gives me a spanking!

117
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:49,798
Your list is driving me mad.

118
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:53,468
Okay, should l move?

119
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,104
- Today is the first day of oflice.
- That is true.

120
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:59,608
- Okay, should l move?
- If Dad calls?

121
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:03,914
Then l'll be in trouble.
Okay, should l move?

122
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:06,715
What if you're needed in the oflice?

123
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:10,751
Okay, should l move?

124
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:14,356
- Please go ahead.
- Okay, l'm ofl.

125
00:20:29,363 --> 00:20:32,435
The heart is at peace
by a glimpse of you.

126
00:20:42,476 --> 00:20:44,279
The enemy of my peace is back!

127
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:55,923
What is it?

128
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,093
Come on.

129
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:00,861
Finally found time?

130
00:21:04,531 --> 00:21:10,609
l had so many business appointments
since morning that l'm tired.

131
00:21:11,272 --> 00:21:13,042
Only now l've found time
for Menaka darling.

132
00:21:13,907 --> 00:21:16,012
Let's go out. We'll freak out.

133
00:21:18,312 --> 00:21:21,117
No, l'm exhausted.
l'm feeling sleepy.

134
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:25,889
Go to bed. This isn't your cup of tea!

135
00:21:27,321 --> 00:21:28,556
That's a funny friend you have.

136
00:21:28,922 --> 00:21:33,464
Why didn't he come with us?
Said he's tired and sleepy.

137
00:21:33,995 --> 00:21:35,864
- Neither is he tired not sleepy.
- Meaning?

138
00:21:36,297 --> 00:21:39,836
l know him very well.
He must be reading something.

139
00:21:40,267 --> 00:21:44,308
- You mean it was an excuse.
- To get rid of us.

140
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:48,078
Because he's not
interested in anything.

141
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:49,843
Not even in pretty girls?

142
00:21:50,311 --> 00:21:53,050
Girls? He runs miles away from them.

143
00:21:53,714 --> 00:21:55,184
He's a modern Viswamitra.

144
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,120
lf l disturb his penance...?

145
00:21:58,418 --> 00:22:01,158
l'll throw a grand party
for you and your friends!

146
00:22:12,132 --> 00:22:16,107
- What's this?
- A picture and this for real.

147
00:22:16,537 --> 00:22:20,811
- l'm busy and Akash isn't here.
- l know that.

148
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:26,685
But what do l do? Since l set
eyes on you, l see only you!

149
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:30,020
You misunderstand me.

150
00:22:31,118 --> 00:22:32,720
l'm not interested in these things.

151
00:22:33,887 --> 00:22:37,361
l know that you're the
modern Viswamitra.

152
00:22:38,392 --> 00:22:39,761
But my name is Menaka.

153
00:22:40,494 --> 00:22:42,798
And l've become to
disrupt your penance.

154
00:22:43,764 --> 00:22:47,905
Considering that you're Akash'
friend, l'm asking you to leave.

155
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:49,571
And if l don't go?

156
00:22:50,271 --> 00:22:52,541
l'll have you thrown out of here.

157
00:22:53,074 --> 00:22:54,409
You can't do that.

158
00:23:01,248 --> 00:23:02,350
What do you think of me?

159
00:23:03,384 --> 00:23:05,921
There's no place in my heart
for society girls like you!

160
00:23:07,088 --> 00:23:08,991
Don't ever try to come here again!

161
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:12,829
My foot won't come to you!

162
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:16,032
Have you ever seen your face?
l got talked into a bet.

163
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,834
Othe_ise a man like you
only deserves pity not love!

164
00:23:19,366 --> 00:23:22,872
You snubbed a pretty girl like me!

165
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:25,808
That is why God has rendered
one of your legs useless!

166
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,978
lf l had my way,
l'd break the other leg too!

167
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:33,650
You're a beggar living ofl others
in addition to being a cripple!

168
00:23:48,162 --> 00:23:50,699
l'd bet you to win
his heart not break it!

169
00:23:51,198 --> 00:23:52,867
You've insulted my friend! l'll...

170
00:23:54,969 --> 00:23:56,738
What are you doing? Are you mad?

171
00:23:57,037 --> 00:24:00,377
- Take her out of my sight!
- Let's go before something happens.

172
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:25,969
Forgive me. Menaka has
been punished for her deeds.

173
00:24:27,267 --> 00:24:28,603
lt's not your fault.

174
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:33,575
lt's that bitter truth of my life...

175
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:37,212
...that l'm used to living with.

176
00:24:38,845 --> 00:24:42,185
Time will tell whether
l'm an ember or a dew drop.

177
00:24:42,716 --> 00:24:45,755
At the moment l'm a tear
glistening on the lashes of time.

178
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:50,261
Exquisite, l swear by poetry.

179
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:54,932
At this tender age,
such thoughts, such depths.

180
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:59,102
This upliftment. l swear...

181
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,338
Every word of your poems...

182
00:25:03,137 --> 00:25:06,243
... stings the heart like a dagger.

183
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:14,388
But l don't understand in spite of
being the loved poet of thousands..

184
00:25:15,016 --> 00:25:17,520
Why are you a stranger to them?

185
00:25:18,385 --> 00:25:21,190
Why don't you let people know that...

186
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:26,030
The one rising like the tide in
their hearts is none other than you!

187
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:31,468
No, l can't do this.

188
00:25:32,766 --> 00:25:34,402
Let it remain a secret.

189
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:39,544
- But why? - l'd like my feelings
to reach every corner of the world.

190
00:25:40,307 --> 00:25:42,912
But l'm scared to
come before the world.

191
00:25:44,344 --> 00:25:48,219
lf mother, Dad or Akash
feel my pain in my songs...

192
00:25:49,016 --> 00:25:50,351
They will be very hurt.

193
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:55,092
They might feel there was
something lacking in my upbringing.

194
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:59,964
l can give up my life for them.

195
00:26:00,962 --> 00:26:02,497
But l can't hurt them.

196
00:26:04,298 --> 00:26:07,604
l live for them not myself.

197
00:26:08,002 --> 00:26:13,512
Great! Not only are you a good
poet but also a good human being.

198
00:26:14,275 --> 00:26:17,781
You embarrass me.

199
00:26:20,147 --> 00:26:21,415
Let's get down to business.

200
00:26:21,848 --> 00:26:24,853
According to your instructions...

201
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:30,361
l send all the royalty
earned by your books to...

202
00:26:30,624 --> 00:26:32,694
Father D'mello's orphanage.

203
00:26:33,193 --> 00:26:38,203
These are some letters and fan mail.

204
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,972
The rest is ordinary but...

205
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:47,444
This is very special.
She seems a devoted fan.

206
00:26:48,075 --> 00:26:51,281
She is always requesting me
for your songs, your poems.

207
00:26:51,946 --> 00:26:55,419
And her name is Miss Pooja.

208
00:26:59,987 --> 00:27:01,990
l will fulfill her request.

209
00:27:03,223 --> 00:27:04,626
l swear by poetry.

210
00:31:36,597 --> 00:31:39,269
The name that l have earned
by singing your songs...

211
00:31:39,834 --> 00:31:44,108
...is truly yours because the
words were from your treasury.

212
00:31:44,939 --> 00:31:49,180
l'm sending you a cutting of the
picture of me receiving the prize.

213
00:31:57,384 --> 00:31:58,619
And a gift for you.

214
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:28,651
Received your letter.
Was happy to read its' contents.

215
00:32:29,016 --> 00:32:31,220
l've kept my word and
sent you my new poem.

216
00:32:31,853 --> 00:32:35,359
Hope you like it.
If you don't, don't hesitate.

217
00:32:35,957 --> 00:32:37,693
Let me know so l can write even better

218
00:32:47,234 --> 00:32:52,310
The blank frame hanging in my house
and l await for your photograph.

219
00:33:02,582 --> 00:33:04,219
You snubbed a pretty girl like me!

220
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:07,056
That is why God has rendered
one of your legs useless.

221
00:33:07,688 --> 00:33:10,226
lf l could, l'd break your other leg!

222
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:14,597
Not only are you a cripple,
you're a beggar who lives ofl others!

223
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:18,434
The Sagar (ocean) of my joy.
The Sagar of my imagination.

224
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:22,941
Every word written by you
sends my heart racing.

225
00:33:23,871 --> 00:33:27,377
Your words woven with
pearls are my very life

226
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:31,548
l pray to God that you keep writing.

227
00:33:40,654 --> 00:33:42,391
Today your face is extra bright.

228
00:33:42,957 --> 00:33:44,526
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

229
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:48,398
Looks like you're a victim of love.

230
00:33:49,864 --> 00:33:51,801
With you around
anything can happen to me.

231
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:56,775
- Why? - Because you have
the world rights for love.

232
00:33:57,705 --> 00:34:02,180
You're talking to me but
your eyes are on that girl.

233
00:34:03,577 --> 00:34:05,681
She looks as smooth as a duck!

234
00:34:06,413 --> 00:34:13,059
l'll enjoy it when the mountain
sitting next to her falls on you.

235
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:16,827
You're talking of the mountain?
l'm thinking of cuddling up!

236
00:34:19,994 --> 00:34:20,862
That mountain?

237
00:34:21,661 --> 00:34:25,169
No, the girl. The little hillock.

238
00:34:25,499 --> 00:34:28,271
Son then you're in for a lashing.

239
00:34:28,803 --> 00:34:31,440
And if l hug her, you'll pay the bill.

240
00:34:32,439 --> 00:34:34,309
Or l'll pay. Fine?

241
00:34:45,452 --> 00:34:47,857
What are you doing?

242
00:34:48,222 --> 00:34:54,000
- l'm blind.
- Take him to the toilet.

243
00:34:58,933 --> 00:35:01,972
Poor boy. He's blind.

244
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:04,205
He's had it.

245
00:35:05,673 --> 00:35:09,279
Get dinner fast.
Or l'll have to eat a punch.

246
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:36,438
What a lively boy.

247
00:35:40,808 --> 00:35:43,546
Seeing them together l'm
reminded of the film, -Dosti'

248
00:35:44,045 --> 00:35:46,784
One chap is lame and the other blind.

249
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:50,119
- Who is blind?
- That boy on that table.

250
00:35:50,651 --> 00:35:54,058
He's Akash Verma. He'll become
anything to flirt with girls.

251
00:35:58,225 --> 00:35:59,594
He fooled me!

252
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:02,130
See how l'll teach him a lesson.

253
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:15,511
Forget business. Talk about home.

254
00:36:15,776 --> 00:36:18,883
- About children.
- My children are great.

255
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:21,617
lf one of my sons is a diamond,
the other is the Kohinoor diamond!

256
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:25,021
How do you diflerentiate between them?

257
00:36:25,486 --> 00:36:27,156
How do l tell them apart?

258
00:36:27,922 --> 00:36:30,426
Hear and decide for yourself.
Take Aman for example.

259
00:36:30,891 --> 00:36:34,365
A turbulent mind
becomes calm at seeing him.

260
00:36:34,862 --> 00:36:37,366
When he speaks it feels as if
rose petals fall from his lips.

261
00:36:37,832 --> 00:36:40,837
Great! Then why don't
you open a flower shop?

262
00:36:41,703 --> 00:36:45,342
l also want to start a shoe shop.
No place. Shall l use your head?

263
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,746
Don't be angry. The other son?

264
00:36:49,443 --> 00:36:56,858
Akash will write the name
of Varmas in the sky with light.

265
00:36:57,284 --> 00:36:58,954
He will add light to our family name.

266
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,262
He's a dark horse.

267
00:37:07,662 --> 00:37:11,602
l mean he'll run ahead of everybody.

268
00:37:16,738 --> 00:37:19,142
He'll keep running with
the world behind him.

269
00:37:19,373 --> 00:37:21,276
He'll keep running so will people.

270
00:37:27,248 --> 00:37:29,285
Stop the car.

271
00:37:38,292 --> 00:37:39,995
He's really running
like a horse in a race.

272
00:37:42,296 --> 00:37:44,099
He's ahead with people behind him!

273
00:37:48,836 --> 00:37:51,741
Tomatoes instead of flowers.
Stones instead of love!

274
00:37:52,472 --> 00:37:53,742
Sticks instead of reward!

275
00:37:54,742 --> 00:37:56,544
What about our family name?

276
00:38:03,685 --> 00:38:07,291
- What happened to your family name?
- Nothing. Get ofl the car.

277
00:38:07,789 --> 00:38:09,826
- He's getting beating and l have
to alight? - Get ofl quickly!

278
00:38:10,324 --> 00:38:11,392
How will l go home?

279
00:38:11,693 --> 00:38:14,632
- Take a cab.
- Cabs don't go there.

280
00:38:14,895 --> 00:38:17,300
- Then take a rickshaw.
- How will that go if cabs don't?

281
00:38:17,632 --> 00:38:18,767
Take your legs and go!

282
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,073
- l hold your legs.
- Not on hire, out!

283
00:38:29,844 --> 00:38:33,016
What's wrong with him? He's getting
beaten and l have to get ofl!

284
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,749
Use your legs!

285
00:38:35,549 --> 00:38:38,521
l'm ashamed of your condition.
Feel like drowning myself!

286
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:39,987
Why are you sounding link a man?

287
00:38:40,221 --> 00:38:44,495
- What is it? - You're on the
phone when l'm scolding you!

288
00:38:44,892 --> 00:38:46,962
There's no respect!

289
00:38:47,962 --> 00:38:49,999
How did this tear?
Why did you get beaten up?

290
00:38:50,331 --> 00:38:53,370
You won't understand.
l'd gone for a fancy dress party.

291
00:38:53,934 --> 00:38:56,105
And those fools
thought l was a beggar!

292
00:38:57,905 --> 00:39:00,409
Do l really look that foolish?

293
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:02,945
- Not that much.
- What? - Why?

294
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:07,517
Beggars are given charity, not
beaten by tomatoes, eggs, stones!

295
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:13,525
- How do you know?
- l was passing by. l saw you chased.

296
00:39:14,656 --> 00:39:16,225
Long live fathers of today!

297
00:39:17,491 --> 00:39:19,629
- Didn't try to rescue me!
- Me rescue you?

298
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:22,397
So that people leave you
and beat me up instead?

299
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:26,971
- Should have iced him there!
- l'm not ice cream to be frozen!

300
00:39:27,368 --> 00:39:29,573
- l'll give you one!
- The father within awakens!

301
00:39:29,837 --> 00:39:32,308
The one outside not within!

302
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:38,450
Forgive him now. l promise you
he'll never repeat it again.

303
00:39:39,781 --> 00:39:41,183
l swear by my Dad l won't do it.

304
00:39:41,582 --> 00:39:42,851
- Sure?
- Sure.

305
00:39:43,483 --> 00:39:44,385
Must be Julie.

306
00:39:45,085 --> 00:39:48,827
This telephone is the reason
he's getting spoilt!

307
00:39:49,256 --> 00:39:52,730
You're right. If l get this
line cut all his lines will be cut!

308
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,095
Ass! Donkey!

309
00:39:55,229 --> 00:39:59,705
Whatever l am, however l am,
l am only your son.

310
00:40:06,974 --> 00:40:08,844
My business partner.

311
00:40:09,509 --> 00:40:13,117
My son Aman. We're building
a big hotel in Ooty with him.

312
00:40:13,547 --> 00:40:15,317
The entire construction
responsibility is yours.

313
00:40:15,817 --> 00:40:20,960
- Me? - The cold climate
of Ooty has aflected him.

314
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:23,025
lt's not that.

315
00:40:23,624 --> 00:40:26,463
l'm not sure whether
l can handle it well...

316
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:29,231
l am confident you will.

317
00:40:30,665 --> 00:40:32,668
- When do l have to leave?
- When does the flight leave?

318
00:40:32,967 --> 00:40:35,071
- Tomorrow.
- Is it your Pop's flight?

319
00:40:35,737 --> 00:40:38,007
lt leaves on Monday.
When will you reach?

320
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:39,007
ln 4 days.

321
00:40:40,174 --> 00:40:43,280
My other son. Listen to me..

322
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:49,088
- Why are you looking there?
- l've seen him somewhere.

323
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:52,422
ln some party or restaurant.
l'm the life of every party.

324
00:40:52,754 --> 00:40:54,423
l'm always followed by thousands.

325
00:40:56,758 --> 00:40:58,227
One in front followed by thousands!

326
00:40:58,593 --> 00:41:00,830
A dark...

327
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:04,133
- Let me say horse.
- Doesn't sound nice from an ass.

328
00:41:04,431 --> 00:41:08,205
- Go home! - First you say come
to oflice, then you say go home!

329
00:41:12,439 --> 00:41:13,642
Are you making fun of my son?

330
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:16,913
Let your son do anything,
l'll have it printed in the papers!

331
00:41:17,378 --> 00:41:19,916
- l don't have a son.
- Then who was in your house?

332
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,653
- The neighbor's son.
- And that woman in your house?

333
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:23,952
She is my wife.

334
00:41:25,486 --> 00:41:28,258
Any problems? Go do your work.

335
00:41:29,456 --> 00:41:33,063
Laxmi will come to pick
you up from the airport.

336
00:41:33,528 --> 00:41:34,997
He'll tell you the rest.

337
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,508
Since when are you here?

338
00:41:47,775 --> 00:41:53,920
- And before this?
- l was in Vellore.

339
00:41:54,949 --> 00:41:59,490
- How did you come here?
- What happened...

340
00:41:59,754 --> 00:42:01,657
l once had a picture taken.

341
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:06,765
The positive appeared negative.

342
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:11,435
The photographer told me...

343
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:15,472
You'll become an ape in Vellore.

344
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:27,951
- Can you cook well?
- Yes sir.

345
00:42:28,349 --> 00:42:32,056
My parents were good cooks.

346
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:38,330
Once you eat good cooked by me
you'll lick your fingers.

347
00:42:42,763 --> 00:42:47,907
You cook very well.
You should join a 5 star hotel.

348
00:42:48,636 --> 00:42:51,040
You're pulling my leg.
Here, wash your hands.

349
00:42:53,007 --> 00:42:55,244
- Is there any good market nearby?
- Sure.

350
00:42:56,077 --> 00:42:57,312
Just 5 minutes away.

351
00:42:58,379 --> 00:42:59,548
- What do you get there?
- Shoes.

352
00:43:00,582 --> 00:43:03,253
- What nonsense!
- Listen to the rest.

353
00:43:03,818 --> 00:43:07,090
Shoes, clothes, fruits, everything.

354
00:43:08,122 --> 00:43:09,324
What do you want?

355
00:43:10,525 --> 00:43:11,560
l want some books.

356
00:43:11,859 --> 00:43:14,564
- Is there any book stall?
- Book and stall too.

357
00:43:14,896 --> 00:43:17,066
- The owner is incomparable.
- What do you mean?

358
00:43:17,532 --> 00:43:21,405
Her name is Pooja but deeds othe_ise.

359
00:43:35,683 --> 00:43:38,320
Are you responsible for everybody?

360
00:43:39,086 --> 00:43:41,356
Then why did you pay the rent
for Asha's shop?

361
00:43:42,056 --> 00:43:43,826
That gangster was troubling her.

362
00:43:44,526 --> 00:43:46,696
l thought you'd be happy
we could help somebody.

363
00:43:46,994 --> 00:43:52,905
But l get scared when you
start preaching to a hoodlum.

364
00:43:53,868 --> 00:43:56,005
You make a mountain out of a molehill.

365
00:43:57,337 --> 00:43:58,908
Pass me the books. l'll put them away

366
00:44:10,885 --> 00:44:12,521
Do you have the latest Newsweek?

367
00:44:12,853 --> 00:44:14,289
Sure. Come in.

368
00:44:17,892 --> 00:44:19,427
Mother! Pass the books.

369
00:44:34,509 --> 00:44:35,510
A little more space.

370
00:45:03,971 --> 00:45:06,476
She's much more
beautiful than l imagined!

371
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:10,613
- Did you say something?
- No.

372
00:45:11,345 --> 00:45:16,088
l want some editions of poets.

373
00:45:17,151 --> 00:45:24,231
lf you won't feel hurt may l say
something? Everyone has his choice.

374
00:45:24,726 --> 00:45:29,902
But have you ever read Sagar's work?

375
00:45:31,098 --> 00:45:32,400
Who the hell is he?

376
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:36,240
Haven't you heard of him?
He's a famous poet of these times.

377
00:45:36,804 --> 00:45:39,008
l'm sure you'll like his work.

378
00:45:40,675 --> 00:45:42,745
What can these poets of today write!

379
00:45:44,245 --> 00:45:49,054
They steal drops from the works of
famous poets and become oceans!

380
00:45:49,817 --> 00:45:53,089
No knowledge of the sound of
anklets yet write about it!

381
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:02,366
l won't take it lightly if
you speak one word against Sagar!

382
00:46:02,764 --> 00:46:05,603
- What will you do?
- l won't give these books.

383
00:46:06,501 --> 00:46:09,372
Looks like you...
what's the poet's name?

384
00:46:09,904 --> 00:46:14,012
Looks like you like him too much.

385
00:46:14,341 --> 00:46:17,380
Yes l do! None of your business!

386
00:46:18,846 --> 00:46:21,183
l mean you are flying ofl
the handle for no reason.

387
00:46:21,449 --> 00:46:24,287
l take back my words.
Now give me the books.

388
00:46:28,523 --> 00:46:32,296
lf Sagar's new edition
is included in this...?

389
00:46:33,761 --> 00:46:35,029
Then you'll even get a discount!

390
00:46:38,299 --> 00:46:40,069
How much is the bill
after deducting the discount?

391
00:46:40,702 --> 00:46:43,541
Rupees 40 for the books,
10 as discount. That's 30.

392
00:46:54,816 --> 00:46:56,519
Seems new to our city.

393
00:46:57,785 --> 00:47:01,792
- Looks like a stranger.
- An interesting stranger.

394
00:47:04,892 --> 00:47:08,298
You don't know Sagar?
He's a famous poet of these times.

395
00:47:08,796 --> 00:47:10,966
l'm sure you will like his work.

396
00:47:20,642 --> 00:47:23,179
But why are you laughing?

397
00:47:23,645 --> 00:47:25,382
l'm laughing because you're laughing.

398
00:47:26,381 --> 00:47:27,483
lt's great fun!

399
00:47:29,717 --> 00:47:31,086
The phone is ringing.

400
00:47:36,257 --> 00:47:37,460
lt's the door.

401
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:48,040
- Who is it?
- Somebody from Bombay for you.

402
00:47:48,436 --> 00:47:54,548
- When did you come?
- This morning.

403
00:47:55,176 --> 00:47:59,618
- How are mother, Dad, Akash?
- Fine. They miss you.

404
00:48:00,715 --> 00:48:04,254
- l too miss them.
- Hope you have no problems here.

405
00:48:05,186 --> 00:48:08,393
lf he has any problems,
l'll sort it out.

406
00:48:09,256 --> 00:48:11,527
l have a very long name.

407
00:48:18,065 --> 00:48:20,937
- Get some tea for him.
- In a minute.

408
00:48:21,736 --> 00:48:23,171
Now who has come!

409
00:48:24,939 --> 00:48:28,011
There are some maps and papers in this

410
00:48:28,576 --> 00:48:30,379
See them and try to understand.

411
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,974
Good day sir. Come in and sit.

412
00:49:02,543 --> 00:49:04,814
How can l serve you?

413
00:49:05,947 --> 00:49:10,956
- Get me first class tea.
- We don't serve it.

414
00:49:11,953 --> 00:49:13,221
Then do you serve third class tea?

415
00:49:13,654 --> 00:49:17,328
We serve no class of tea.
We only have...

416
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:27,504
Does every tea here carry Ram's name?

417
00:49:27,802 --> 00:49:31,041
Yes. What is that sir?

418
00:49:33,574 --> 00:49:39,753
l'm Bajrangbali's devotee.
You tell me whose devotee he was.

419
00:49:40,548 --> 00:49:45,491
- Ram's. - Yes.
That's why tea carries his name!

420
00:49:45,987 --> 00:49:47,824
So get me one Rampyari.

421
00:49:48,289 --> 00:49:52,163
Get one Rampyari for sir.

422
00:50:06,073 --> 00:50:07,376
Can l get a paper and pen?

423
00:50:07,542 --> 00:50:08,677
Here you are.

424
00:50:30,965 --> 00:50:34,271
- One tea.
- Get a tea for sir.

425
00:51:58,953 --> 00:52:01,591
So back on the same path?

426
00:52:02,222 --> 00:52:03,292
To the same destination?

427
00:52:04,091 --> 00:52:06,128
Who are you?

428
00:52:07,629 --> 00:52:10,701
l'm your reflection, your conscience.

429
00:52:12,133 --> 00:52:16,876
l want to bring what's in
your heart to your tongue.

430
00:52:17,439 --> 00:52:21,814
That you love Pooja intensely.

431
00:52:22,843 --> 00:52:26,150
And that love for her has
created a storm in your heart.

432
00:52:27,315 --> 00:52:29,084
And your heart has accepted her.

433
00:52:29,684 --> 00:52:35,227
You worshipped her and now
she's the purpose of your life.

434
00:52:36,891 --> 00:52:37,959
You are right.

435
00:52:39,126 --> 00:52:40,529
l love her too much.

436
00:52:41,796 --> 00:52:45,002
Then why don't you tell her?

437
00:52:46,568 --> 00:52:48,070
Some day l will.

438
00:52:49,571 --> 00:52:50,940
l'll tell her l'm her Sagar!

439
00:52:54,642 --> 00:52:55,910
Have some sweets dear.

440
00:52:56,811 --> 00:53:01,420
- What for?
- Because my shop is doing very well.

441
00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:03,352
Really? How come?

442
00:53:03,951 --> 00:53:05,587
- Thanks to you.
- Thanks to me?

443
00:53:06,321 --> 00:53:09,092
A stranger comes to my shop everyday.

444
00:53:09,357 --> 00:53:12,061
And drinks 30-40 cups
of tea by evening.

445
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:13,762
How am l involved?

446
00:53:14,061 --> 00:53:17,233
Actually his eyes are on your shop.

447
00:53:17,932 --> 00:53:19,368
Eyes here, tea there.

448
00:53:19,734 --> 00:53:23,441
And the total rupees 30.25

449
00:53:24,372 --> 00:53:28,212
So this is the matter!
Let that 30.25 come.

450
00:53:28,743 --> 00:53:30,780
l'll teach him such a lesson
that he'll forget to drink tea!

451
00:53:31,145 --> 00:53:33,316
Then what about my business?

452
00:53:33,715 --> 00:53:37,054
Don't worry. Call me when he comes.

453
00:53:37,385 --> 00:53:40,257
That l'll do but keep
the honor of these sweets.

454
00:53:40,688 --> 00:53:44,161
Lord! What difliculty
have you gotten me into!

455
00:53:48,095 --> 00:53:51,936
What have l done!
Ruined my own business!

456
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:55,806
Lord! Save this foolish man!

457
00:53:56,170 --> 00:54:00,111
- How are you?
- The Lord is kind.

458
00:54:05,547 --> 00:54:07,918
The stranger has come!

459
00:54:13,288 --> 00:54:16,059
So what's the latest news?

460
00:54:19,193 --> 00:54:22,667
l've heard the weather
outside is terrible!

461
00:54:23,531 --> 00:54:26,570
Dark clouds are gathering.

462
00:54:27,168 --> 00:54:30,173
Clouds are going to burst.

463
00:54:30,805 --> 00:54:32,575
Lightning is going to strike.

464
00:54:33,275 --> 00:54:35,879
There are chances of terrible rain!

465
00:54:52,393 --> 00:54:54,130
Great! Exceptional!

466
00:54:54,596 --> 00:54:58,002
Listen to what Sagar says.

467
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:01,705
A picture is painted
in my heart since ages.

468
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:08,415
My destiny sits in
the shade of your tresses.

469
00:55:09,477 --> 00:55:10,879
That book stall girl was right.

470
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:24,927
Listen to what else he has written.

471
00:55:26,628 --> 00:55:30,702
As far as my vision..

472
00:55:31,699 --> 00:55:34,003
l see only you, just you.

473
00:55:34,935 --> 00:55:36,038
l see you every moment.

474
00:55:36,871 --> 00:55:41,313
lt's only the jeweler who
knows the value of the diamond.

475
00:55:43,611 --> 00:55:48,354
l'm reciting Sagar's poems to you
and you're not concentrating.

476
00:55:48,883 --> 00:55:52,257
l meant to ask which
era did he write in?

477
00:55:52,953 --> 00:55:55,492
- And where does he live?
- in my own city.

478
00:55:56,391 --> 00:55:58,795
And because of that l do meet him.

479
00:55:59,861 --> 00:56:02,800
lt's after coming here
that l learnt he writes well.

480
00:56:03,765 --> 00:56:05,033
Didn't you know before that?

481
00:56:05,466 --> 00:56:09,374
That's a sign of greatness.
They never proclaim their greatness.

482
00:56:10,372 --> 00:56:13,311
Sagar, you turned out to
be deeper than the ocean!

483
00:56:14,141 --> 00:56:19,017
Now when l meet you,
l'll kiss your hand and say..

484
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,219
What will you say?

485
00:56:23,618 --> 00:56:26,155
You are great!

486
00:56:27,222 --> 00:56:30,194
One fantastic Rampyari for him from me

487
00:56:31,158 --> 00:56:34,431
- Why the formality?
- Because you know Sagar.

488
00:56:34,696 --> 00:56:36,866
You belong to the same city,
you move in the same circles.

489
00:56:37,131 --> 00:56:39,101
And l'm his fan.

490
00:56:40,335 --> 00:56:45,878
lf you know Sagar, why did you
abuse him in my shop?

491
00:56:47,542 --> 00:56:49,812
l wanted to test the
limits of your love.

492
00:56:50,545 --> 00:56:52,147
By the way how do you know him?

493
00:56:52,547 --> 00:56:54,149
Through letters and his poems.

494
00:56:56,751 --> 00:56:58,187
Tell me something else about him.

495
00:56:58,886 --> 00:57:00,189
Ask me something else about him.

496
00:57:02,324 --> 00:57:05,263
- How does he look?
- He's smart and young.

497
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:09,534
Really? Can't you
introduce me to him?

498
00:57:09,964 --> 00:57:13,571
Definitely but on one condition.

499
00:57:16,604 --> 00:57:20,545
That you'll show me
this beautiful place.

500
00:57:21,476 --> 00:57:24,148
Because l'm new to this area.

501
00:57:24,645 --> 00:57:25,881
ls that all?

502
00:57:26,714 --> 00:57:27,749
So it's a promise?

503
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:57,815
Mother, this is Aman.

504
01:03:01,749 --> 01:03:03,419
Have you come here for sight seeing?

505
01:03:03,951 --> 01:03:07,458
My Dad is constructing a hotel
here. l'm here in that regard.

506
01:03:08,889 --> 01:03:13,799
What a fool l am! l forgot to
tell you he knows Sagar very well.

507
01:03:14,395 --> 01:03:15,631
Now you're in deep trouble!

508
01:03:16,164 --> 01:03:18,234
- l don't understand.
- Neither do l.

509
01:03:18,933 --> 01:03:21,371
God knows why she is crazy for him!

510
01:03:22,503 --> 01:03:26,345
Now she'll drive you mad
talking about Sagar all the time!

511
01:03:27,175 --> 01:03:30,681
You've started ofl again!
l'll show you our house.

512
01:03:36,917 --> 01:03:38,021
This is Billu's room.

513
01:03:39,087 --> 01:03:41,724
That's mother's room.
And there's our prayer room.

514
01:03:42,824 --> 01:03:44,661
And that's the guest room.

515
01:03:49,797 --> 01:03:52,936
And this is my room.

516
01:04:01,176 --> 01:04:02,611
See the view from here.

517
01:04:03,778 --> 01:04:05,448
Everything looks so beautiful.

518
01:04:09,251 --> 01:04:12,223
Yes, it's truly beautiful.

519
01:04:13,554 --> 01:04:17,963
lf Kashmir is heaven on earth,
this place is our heaven!

520
01:04:19,127 --> 01:04:22,700
This place has made me
forget heaven on earth!

521
01:04:37,145 --> 01:04:39,115
You're wondering why
the frame is blank.

522
01:04:40,548 --> 01:04:43,487
This frame is waiting
for Sagar's photograph.

523
01:04:51,693 --> 01:04:55,367
Your wait is over.
Sagar has come in person.

524
01:05:02,204 --> 01:05:02,938
Pooja here.

525
01:05:04,772 --> 01:05:07,244
How did you think of me
so early in the morning?

526
01:05:07,875 --> 01:05:10,547
- To remind you of this evening.
- Anything special?

527
01:05:11,112 --> 01:05:15,354
That's why l called. There's a grand
show at Nehru Stadium this evening.

528
01:05:15,817 --> 01:05:17,387
l'm also taking part in it.

529
01:05:18,053 --> 01:05:23,663
- Then l will definitely come.
- Don't be late. l'll be waiting.

530
01:11:40,836 --> 01:11:46,012
l didn't know you dance so well.

531
01:11:46,507 --> 01:11:49,547
Forget it. l'm very happy today.

532
01:11:50,378 --> 01:11:53,617
The show went of better than...
Veera....?

533
01:12:01,389 --> 01:12:03,659
l'm a poet and you're my poetry.

534
01:12:05,327 --> 01:12:07,698
That day you escaped my clutches.

535
01:12:08,529 --> 01:12:10,500
But who will rescue you today?

536
01:12:11,967 --> 01:12:14,137
- Come on. - Let go!
- Get lost!

537
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:33,255
Don't beat him!

538
01:12:57,078 --> 01:12:58,648
Police! Run!

539
01:12:59,047 --> 01:13:00,282
Catch them all!
Don't let anyone escape!

540
01:13:03,451 --> 01:13:04,386
What were you doing here?

541
01:13:05,253 --> 01:13:09,127
You know how helpless you are.

542
01:13:09,858 --> 01:13:13,497
Man protects woman. You can't
Iook after yourself forget any girl!

543
01:13:13,862 --> 01:13:17,970
Had anything untoward happened
you wouldn't ever forgive yourself!

544
01:13:22,270 --> 01:13:25,877
Excellent God!
What justice you mete out!

545
01:13:27,642 --> 01:13:30,782
You snatched my parents
as soon as l took birth.

546
01:13:31,413 --> 01:13:33,216
l said nothing.

547
01:13:34,249 --> 01:13:37,722
When l was able to walk,
you gave me these crutches.

548
01:13:38,686 --> 01:13:39,621
l kept mum.

549
01:13:40,522 --> 01:13:44,964
From childhood to youth
l had to cross many dark alleys.

550
01:13:45,827 --> 01:13:47,363
l had to bear loneliness.

551
01:13:48,396 --> 01:13:50,566
l bore everything. Do you know why?

552
01:13:51,967 --> 01:13:54,705
Because l'm accustomed to
drinking this bitter truth!

553
01:13:56,204 --> 01:13:59,878
But when you made me realize this
bitter truth in front of Pooja...

554
01:14:01,276 --> 01:14:02,711
l couldn't tolerate it.

555
01:14:04,612 --> 01:14:06,315
Today l realize it, dear God...

556
01:14:07,282 --> 01:14:09,386
l am truly an incomplete man!

557
01:14:09,952 --> 01:14:13,258
A cripple! Is this my fault?

558
01:14:13,922 --> 01:14:15,190
ls this my crime?

559
01:14:16,391 --> 01:14:18,863
Who made this incomplete man?

560
01:14:19,594 --> 01:14:24,236
Who has made me a joke
in the eyes of the world?

561
01:14:26,835 --> 01:14:28,772
Answer me! Who brought me
to this juncture of life?

562
01:14:29,237 --> 01:14:33,846
You! You are the culprit not me!

563
01:14:34,675 --> 01:14:36,413
You are at fault not me!

564
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,552
For what crime are you punishing me?

565
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:43,786
Answer me!

566
01:15:23,826 --> 01:15:25,195
Let's go.

567
01:15:45,413 --> 01:15:47,316
l've found the answer
to every question, my Lord.

568
01:15:49,084 --> 01:15:50,286
Forgive me.

569
01:15:52,253 --> 01:15:54,558
Good your plane didn't get derailed.

570
01:15:55,023 --> 01:15:59,799
Once l was going to America, the
plane was delayed. Both stayed here.

571
01:16:00,328 --> 01:16:04,469
Ouiet. Hope you didn't
tell Aman l'm coming.

572
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,237
How could l say when
you told me not to tell him?

573
01:16:07,502 --> 01:16:09,740
You said so l didn't tell him.

574
01:16:10,038 --> 01:16:13,177
But why the suspense?

575
01:16:13,909 --> 01:16:16,814
Anything that occurs suddenly
has its' own pleasure.

576
01:16:17,379 --> 01:16:19,717
Aman and l will meet
each other suddenly.

577
01:16:26,454 --> 01:16:29,159
What happened suddenly, mamma mia!

578
01:16:29,657 --> 01:16:31,895
l think the tire is punctured.

579
01:16:32,493 --> 01:16:34,765
How did this happen suddenly?

580
01:16:38,533 --> 01:16:41,372
Did you call me beautiful?

581
01:16:41,669 --> 01:16:47,380
You look after the tire.
l'll look after them.

582
01:16:47,943 --> 01:16:49,512
What is it?

583
01:17:35,223 --> 01:17:36,491
Do you mind getting up?

584
01:17:45,233 --> 01:17:46,602
Walking like a blind bat!

585
01:18:02,317 --> 01:18:03,485
Tire ready sir.

586
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:07,524
He's got a flat!

587
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,999
wWw.BuGGeRs.Tk

588
01:23:18,033 --> 01:23:19,101
What a girl she was!
