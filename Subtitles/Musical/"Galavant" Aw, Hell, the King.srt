00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,976
This is where I kept my formal
crowns, my casual crowns,

5
00:00:08,977 --> 00:00:10,311
my "just for fun" crowns.

6
00:00:10,312 --> 00:00:13,414
Yes, this is definitely
where my castle was!

7
00:00:13,415 --> 00:00:14,482
Okay, are we done?

8
00:00:14,483 --> 00:00:15,850
Because I either need to find your army

9
00:00:15,851 --> 00:00:17,452
or I need to go and find another one

10
00:00:17,453 --> 00:00:18,820
so I can go and save Isabella.

11

Oh, relax, chisel chin. You'll get my army.

12

13

this village before,

here you recognize?

Maybe...Your king?

28

It is I, King Richard!

I have returned! Good to see you again.

31

So, I have a question.

32
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:08,769
What the hell happened to my castle?!

33
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,205
Yeah, we, uh... We sort of tore it down

34
00:01:11,206 --> 00:01:13,674
to make homes and shops for everybody.

35
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:15,843
Oh, well, that would explain
the familiarity.

36
00:01:15,844 --> 00:01:16,944
You knocked it down?!

37
00:01:16,945 --> 00:01:18,913
I demand you rebuild it immediately,

38
00:01:18,914 --> 00:01:21,449
or I will have every one of you
drawn and quartered and...

39
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,583
What's going on?

40
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:25,052
W-why are they not scurrying
to do my bidding?

41
00:01:25,053 --> 00:01:27,488
Oh, well, here's the thing.

42
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:30,725
When you left us to go in search
of the Jewel of Valencia,

43
00:01:30,726 --> 00:01:33,861
we didn't hear anything
for a really long time.

44
00:01:33,862 --> 00:01:35,696
All right, that's fair. That's on me.

45
00:01:35,697 --> 00:01:36,998
I should've sent a pigeon or two.

46
00:01:36,999 --> 00:01:38,933
Yeah, but while you were away,

47
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:41,202
we realized that a king is only a king

48
00:01:41,203 --> 00:01:42,603
if the people say he is.

49

51
00:01:47,376 --> 00:01:48,843
who's only in charge

52
00:01:48,844 --> 00:01:51,112
because his father wore
a metal hat before him,

53
00:01:51,113 --> 00:01:52,847
which is pretty crazy
if you think about it.

54

You know, he's... He's got a point.

It<i> is</i> pretty crazy.

57
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:01,355
Hmm. So, then we came together
and asked ourselves,

"what if there was a different
way of doing things?

Oh, my God.

531
00:20:19,175 --> 00:20:21,009
Oh, this is gonna be so much fun!

532
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:21,944
No, it's not.

533
00:20:21,945 --> 00:20:23,378
Well, we should probably go.

534
00:20:23,379 --> 00:20:25,581
I stole these horses and just
set fire to the Rec Center.

535
00:20:25,582 --> 00:20:28,049
Dismantle my castle, will you?

536
00:20:28,918 --> 00:20:30,952
[Cheers and applause]

537
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:36,892
Princess Isabella,

538
00:20:36,893 --> 00:20:39,795
isn't there something
you might want to say?

539
00:20:39,796 --> 00:20:42,331
[Sighs] Good news, everyone!

540
00:20:42,332 --> 00:20:44,299
I've set a date for my wedding.

541
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,470
It's in six weeks, and you're all invited!

542
00:20:48,471 --> 00:20:51,306
[Cheers and applause]

543
00:20:51,307 --> 00:20:53,475
[Fanfare]

544
00:20:53,476 --> 00:20:55,711
Does something seem different
about Princess Isabella?

545
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:59,248
Who cares? She's getting married!

546
00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:00,716
Boom! Boom!

547
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,518
[Cheers and applause continue]
