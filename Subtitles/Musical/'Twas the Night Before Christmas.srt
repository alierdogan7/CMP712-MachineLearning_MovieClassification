<i>He held tight in his teeth</i>

329
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:20,912
<i>And the smoke, it encircled his head</i>
<i>Like a wreath</i>

330
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:24,986
<i>He had a broad face</i>
<i>And a round little belly</i>

331
00:22:25,155 --> 00:22:28,955
<i>That shook when he laughed</i>
<i>Like a bowlful of jelly</i>

332
00:22:29,126 --> 00:22:33,563
<i>He was chubby and plump</i>
<i>A right jolly old elf</i>

333
00:22:33,731 --> 00:22:36,666
<i>And I laughed when I saw him</i>
<i>In spite of myself</i>

334
00:22:37,334 --> 00:22:39,598
<i>A wink of his eye</i>
<i>And a twist of his head</i>

335
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:43,262
<i>Soon gave me to know</i>
<i>I had nothing to dread</i>

336
00:22:43,574 --> 00:22:46,475
<i>He spoke not a word</i>
<i>But went straight to his work</i>

337
00:22:46,644 --> 00:22:50,375
<i>And filled all the stockings</i>
<i>Then turned with a jerk</i>

338
00:22:50,547 --> 00:22:53,277
<i>And laying his finger</i>
<i>Aside of his nose</i>

339
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,942
<i>And giving a nod</i>
<i>Up the chimney he rose</i>

340
00:22:57,121 --> 00:23:00,454
<i>He sprang to his sleigh</i>
<i>To his team gave a whistle</i>

341
00:23:00,624 --> 00:23:04,958
<i>And away they all flew</i>
<i>Like the down of a thistle</i>

342
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:09,961
<i>But I heard him exclaim</i>
<i>Ere he drove out of sight</i>

343
00:23:10,401 --> 00:23:15,566
Happy Christmas to all,
and to all a good night!

344
00:24:10,004 --> 00:24:11,315
