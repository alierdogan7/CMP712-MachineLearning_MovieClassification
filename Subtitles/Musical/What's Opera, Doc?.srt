1
00:01:02,856 --> 00:01:05,611
Be very quiet.

2
00:01:06,735 --> 00:01:09,455
I'm hunting rabbits.

3
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,812
Rabbit tracks!

4
00:01:27,563 --> 00:01:32,206
Kill the rabbit, kill the rabbit, kill the rabbit!

5
00:01:34,281 --> 00:01:36,097
Kill the rabbit?

6
00:01:37,212 --> 00:01:41,490
Yo ho to oh! Yo ho to oh! Yo ho...

7
00:01:43,134 --> 00:01:47,733
O mighty warrior of great fighting stock

8
00:01:48,384 --> 00:01:51,695
Might I inquire to ask, eh...

9
00:01:52,255 --> 00:01:54,540
What's up doc?

10
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,679
I'm going to kill the rabbit!

11
00:01:58,244 --> 00:02:02,334
O mighty hunter, 'twill be quite a task

12
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:08,385
How will you do it, might I inquire to ask?

13
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:12,221
I will do it with my spear and magic helmet.

14
00:02:12,731 --> 00:02:14,452
Your spear and magic helmet?

15
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:15,658
Spear and magic helmet.

16
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:16,532
Magic helmet?

17
00:02:16,545 --> 00:02:17,597
Magic helmet!

18
00:02:18,281 --> 00:02:19,900
Magic helmet...

19
00:02:20,537 --> 00:02:28,302
Yes, magic helmet, and I'll give you a sample!

20
00:02:39,558 --> 00:02:40,811
Bye...

21
00:02:41,977 --> 00:02:43,368
That was the rabbit!

22
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:20,315
Oh Brunhilde, you're so lovely

23
00:03:20,781 --> 00:03:22,922
Yes, I know it

24
00:03:22,962 --> 00:03:25,363
I can't help it

25
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:31,294
Oh Brunhilde, be my love

26
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,486
Return my love...

27
00:04:31,016 --> 00:04:35,996
A longing burns deep inside me

28
00:04:36,053 --> 00:04:40,960
Return my love...

29
00:04:41,436 --> 00:04:46,640
I want you always beside me

30
00:04:46,863 --> 00:04:51,326
A love like ours must be...

31
00:04:52,353 --> 00:04:57,871
Made for you and for me...

32
00:04:58,664 --> 00:05:05,715
Return, won't you return my love...

33
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:12,747
For my love is yours

34
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,163
I'll kill the rabbit!

35
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,867
Arise storms!

36
00:05:32,545 --> 00:05:35,249
North winds blow, south winds blow!

37
00:05:35,508 --> 00:05:39,127
Typhoons, Hurricanes... Earthquakes!

38
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:41,368
Smog!

39
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:49,064
Flash lightning! Strike the rabbit!

40
00:06:10,831 --> 00:06:13,231
What have I done?

41
00:06:14,491 --> 00:06:16,679
I've killed the rabbit...

42
00:06:18,596 --> 00:06:21,289
Poor little bunny...

43
00:06:21,997 --> 00:06:24,381
Poor little rabbit...

44
00:06:38,237 --> 00:06:40,365
Well, what did you expect in an opera...?

45
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,252
A happy ending?
