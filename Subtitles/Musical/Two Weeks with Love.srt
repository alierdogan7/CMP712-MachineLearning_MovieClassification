Who wants their money back;

1157
02:07:46,366 --> 02:07:48,994
Anybody can do her number.
My sister, for instance.

1158
02:07:49,168 --> 02:07:51,466
-Yeah, but she doesn't know it.
-l beg to differ.

1159
02:07:51,638 --> 02:07:53,606
She peeked in the window
all during rehearsals.

1160
02:07:53,773 --> 02:07:56,037
She did; Well, where is she;

1161
02:07:56,209 --> 02:07:59,667
l don't know.
You might try the drugstore.

1162
02:08:02,382 --> 02:08:07,081
Here we are.
Here's a nice strawberry soda.

1163
02:08:07,253 --> 02:08:10,780
l guess there's nothing left for me to do
but become a missionary.

1164
02:08:10,957 --> 02:08:14,154
Well, you wouldn't wanna do that
on an empty stomach.

1165
02:08:14,327 --> 02:08:15,692
Try this.

1166
02:08:15,862 --> 02:08:18,387
Oh, good evening, Mrs. Penford.

1167
02:08:20,767 --> 02:08:22,826
-Hello, Billy.
-Patti, the show's in trouble.

1168
02:08:23,002 --> 02:08:25,800
My father wants you to take
Valerie's place. She walked out.

1169
02:08:25,972 --> 02:08:27,940
She did;

1170
02:08:28,341 --> 02:08:29,638
How would l know her number;

1171
02:08:29,809 --> 02:08:32,243
Well, you peeked in the window
during rehearsals.

1172
02:08:32,412 --> 02:08:33,674
Oh.

1173
02:08:33,846 --> 02:08:35,871
No, Billy. lt's out of the question.

1174
02:08:36,115 --> 02:08:38,515
lf you don't,
we'll have to give the money back.

1175
02:08:38,685 --> 02:08:42,052
lt was supposed to go to the
Preservation of Wildlife in the Catskills.

1176
02:08:42,221 --> 02:08:43,245
lt was;

1177
02:08:43,423 --> 02:08:48,190
Think of all those poor little beavers
and possums, skunks and....

1178
02:08:48,361 --> 02:08:49,658
You're right, Billy.

1179
02:08:49,829 --> 02:08:53,424
l mustn't let personal feelings stand
in the way of our four-footed friends.

1180
02:08:53,600 --> 02:08:55,864
-Come on.
-Gee, l hope l peeked enough.

1181
02:08:56,035 --> 02:08:58,868
-You did.
PATTl: Thanks for the soda.

1182
02:08:59,038 --> 02:09:01,472
There goes one
of my satisfied customers.

1183
02:09:01,641 --> 02:09:06,943
Only this afternoon, her father
bought her one of these corsets. Oh.

1184
02:09:09,449 --> 02:09:12,577
She's undoubtedly suffering
from curvature of the spine.

1185
02:09:12,752 --> 02:09:14,777
WOMAN: Oh.
-The corset will correct it.

1186
02:09:14,954 --> 02:09:18,913
But you mustn't bend over in them
or they lock.

1187
02:09:19,092 --> 02:09:21,925
-Like so:
-Really;

1188
02:09:23,763 --> 02:09:26,254
DEMl:
Patti, are you ready;

1189
02:09:26,432 --> 02:09:29,265
You are going to dance with me,
aren't you;

1190
02:09:30,003 --> 02:09:32,801
Please, l need you.

1191
02:09:33,172 --> 02:09:36,573
Oh, Patti, can't you ever forgive me
for what l did;

1192
02:09:36,743 --> 02:09:38,335
Whatever it was.

1193
02:09:38,511 --> 02:09:41,810
lf you don't,
l'll drown myself in the lake.

1194
02:09:50,156 --> 02:09:51,180
Oh, Patti.

1195
02:09:51,357 --> 02:09:53,757
FlNLAY:
Senor Armendez, Miss Robinson, you're on.

1196
02:10:17,250 --> 02:10:19,548
So that's where they went.

1197
02:10:20,653 --> 02:10:22,917
What are you doing after the show;

1198
02:10:29,629 --> 02:10:32,723
Why, there's Patti.
And that's my best dress.

1199
02:10:32,899 --> 02:10:34,764
Tell Mama it was.

1200
02:10:34,934 --> 02:10:37,630
-lt was.
-lt was.

1201
02:12:29,315 --> 02:12:31,647
-You can straighten up now, Patti.
-l can't.

1202
02:12:31,818 --> 02:12:33,115
You can't.

1203
02:12:35,321 --> 02:12:37,380
What; You can't;

1204
02:12:38,791 --> 02:12:41,191
Smile, Patti. Smile.

1205
02:12:41,594 --> 02:12:42,993
Smile, smile.

1206
02:12:43,162 --> 02:12:45,062
Oh, she's laced them up too tight.

1207
02:12:45,231 --> 02:12:47,825
What she got, lockjaw;

1208
02:12:48,701 --> 02:12:50,328
-Stand back. Give her air, will you;
-What is it;

1209
02:12:50,503 --> 02:12:52,027
Frozen muscles. Very interesting.

1210
02:12:52,205 --> 02:12:54,901
-lt's that straitjacket.
-What have you done to my child;

1211
02:12:55,074 --> 02:12:57,941
-Your child is no longer a child.
-l'll take charge of this.

1212
02:12:58,110 --> 02:13:00,772
-Carry her to the dressing room.
-Here, give her to me.

1213
02:13:01,147 --> 02:13:03,980
lmagine, one kiss
causing such complete paralysis.

1214
02:13:04,150 --> 02:13:08,519
Mind your own business.
You buy that man some pants.

1215
02:13:08,688 --> 02:13:10,815
Just set her down here
on the couch, please.

1216
02:13:10,990 --> 02:13:13,254
On my side, please.

1217
02:13:13,960 --> 02:13:15,450
Thank you. Now everyone out.

1218
02:13:15,628 --> 02:13:17,858
-Yes, everybody out. Everybody.
-You too, Papa.

1219
02:13:18,030 --> 02:13:20,362
Me too; Okay, all right.

1220
02:13:22,702 --> 02:13:26,570
-Hurry, Mama.
-Oh, Patti, honey.

1221
02:13:26,973 --> 02:13:32,036
Darling, a surgical corset!

1222
02:13:32,211 --> 02:13:35,112
Your father ought to have
his head examined.

1223
02:13:35,281 --> 02:13:37,476
-There.
-Oh!

1224
02:13:37,650 --> 02:13:40,517
Oh, Mama, how would he know;

1225
02:13:40,686 --> 02:13:43,587
ln other words,
l should have picked it out.

1226
02:13:43,756 --> 02:13:45,951
You're a woman, Mother.

1227
02:13:48,861 --> 02:13:52,627
KATHERlNE:
And so are you, my baby.

1228
02:13:54,166 --> 02:13:56,726
Tomorrow we'll get you
a La Belle Mode corset.

1229
02:13:56,903 --> 02:13:57,927
We will;

1230
02:13:58,104 --> 02:14:00,572
Unless you'd rather have
a whalebone wasp waist.

1231
02:14:00,740 --> 02:14:03,208
-Oh, Mother.
-But as for my new dress....

1232
02:14:03,376 --> 02:14:05,708
Oh, l didn't hurt it, honest.

1233
02:14:05,878 --> 02:14:09,405
You wear it much better than l ever did.
l think you better keep it.

1234
02:14:09,582 --> 02:14:12,483
Besides, don't tell Papa,
but l can't get into it anymore.

1235
02:14:12,652 --> 02:14:14,586
Oh, Mama.

1236
02:14:16,022 --> 02:14:19,480
l'd like permission to call on your daughter
when we get back to the city.

1237
02:14:19,659 --> 02:14:20,683
What for;

1238
02:14:20,860 --> 02:14:24,387
-Well, to get to know her better.
-Seems to me you know her well enough.

1239
02:14:24,563 --> 02:14:25,825
All this kissing, bending.

1240
02:14:25,998 --> 02:14:29,161
lt is customary in my country
to ask permission to call...

1241
02:14:29,335 --> 02:14:31,166
...when a man's intentions are serious.

1242
02:14:31,337 --> 02:14:33,828
You may call, Demi.
We'll be very happy to see you.

1243
02:14:34,006 --> 02:14:35,598
-Look, this man's trying--
-l know.

1244
02:14:35,775 --> 02:14:38,266
-But this is my daughter.
-Papa.

1245
02:14:38,444 --> 02:14:42,005
Don't you think it's about time
you two stopped acting like children ;

1246
02:14:42,181 --> 02:14:45,878
Why, the way you're behaving,
the kids aren't getting any sleep.

1247
02:14:51,757 --> 02:14:53,588
KATHERlNE:
Patti.

1248
02:14:56,862 --> 02:14:59,057
Oh, Mama.

1249
02:15:05,338 --> 02:15:08,136
Well, look at that.
l walked the floor with her...

1250
02:15:08,307 --> 02:15:11,470
...brought her through sickness,
helped her with her homework...

1251
02:15:11,644 --> 02:15:14,704
...and worried and worried
about her happiness.

1252
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:16,541
And now what do l do;

1253
02:15:16,716 --> 02:15:19,048
l walk into a church,
and when the preacher asks:

1254
02:15:19,218 --> 02:15:21,880
''Who gives this woman to this man ;''

1255
02:15:22,054 --> 02:15:26,286
l stand up like a fool and say, ''l do.''

1256
02:15:26,459 --> 02:15:31,055
Papa, my father was no fool.

1257
