[announcer] Times Square, believe me,
is wall-to-wall people

5
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,209
bent on having
the greatest party ever

6
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,171
and being in
on a bit of this history.

7
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,465
What a night this is! What a thrill!

8
00:02:54,632 --> 00:03:00,346
Our boys are coming home
and a lot of them are here right now.

9
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:04,266
I talked with boys
from Arkansas, Colorado, Seattle,

10
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,519
Washington, Los Angeles,
Aberdeen, Washington.

11
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:12,107
Looking around Times Square,
people are delirious.

12
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:16,111
They're holding up newspapers
with huge headlines.

13
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:20,032
"V-J Day," it says.
"War's end. It's over."

14
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,036
They're hugging and kissing,
shouting and cheering,

15
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:28,916
and paper by the ton keeps flowing
out of the windows high above them.

16

[Band] Pennsylvania six-five-thousand!

17
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,840
The USO shows too.

18
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,343
Our hats are off to all those
in show business

19
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:43,597
who traveled the world,
entertaining our men and women.

20
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,146
Times Square is happy,
New York is happy, the US is happy

21
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,148
and the world is at peace.

[announcer] Tommy, I know America wants
to thank you and your organization

26
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,979
for all the great war-bond drives
you put on

27
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:19,068
and for that wonderful radio show,
the Treasury Star Parade.

28
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:22,321
[Tommy] It's been a pleasure
doing our musical bit.

29
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,281
[Announcer] Well, we all loved it.

30
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,801
- Swinging band.
- Yeah.

31
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:49,181
Swinging band, man. Really jumps.
You here by yourself?

32
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,225
- No.
- Who are you with?

33
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:56,939
- My boyfriend.
- Oh. Can I get in touch anyway?

34
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:13,747
Hey. I know you from some place.
We met a few years ago at a party.

35
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:18,877
We really liked each other.
I want to see you again.

36
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,255
My mother and father are down there.

37
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,077
[Man] Jimmy! Jimmy! Hey!

38
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,124
Catch you later, right?

39
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:17,895
- Hey, where've you been?
- Where's your uniform?

40
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,814
- Threw it out the goddamn window!
- Look at those!

41
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:26,070
- Did you jump some Hawaiian?
- I won these in a card game.

42
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:29,782
This guy had three deuces
but I had three threes.

43
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:34,453
- Three threes? Three threes?
- Three threes.

44
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,121
- Card game, huh?
- Card game.

45
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,749
Jackpot! Jackpot!

46
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,379
Glad to have you back, boys.

47
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,542
- I know you from some place.
- No.

48
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,836
- You don't remember me?
- No.

49
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,464
We met a few years ago
at a party or a dance.

50
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,426
- You can't remember that?
- No.

51
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:34,888
I want to explain,
my parents are over there,

52
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:39,560
so I've got to see them because
I just was two years in the service.

53
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:40,811
I want to get your phone number

54
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,523
so I can tell you tomorrow
something very important.

55
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,483
- No.
- No what?

56
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,236
- No what?
- No.

57
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:52,197
- No, you don't understand.
- No.

58
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,367
- Give me your number. Got a pencil?
- No.

59
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,370
All right, just tell me.
I'll remember it.

60
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,498
- No.
- Yes.

61
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,834
- No.
- Can I meet you at Central Park?

62
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,379
- I'm serious.
- I know. No.

63
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,344
- I mean, come on, there's no way...
- No.

64
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:20,017
- That seat's taken.
- I'm figuring out another angle.

65
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,770
Skip it.
I've heard every angle tonight.

66
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:23,937
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

67
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,399
This one?
That's a swinging...

68
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,859
- ...band.
- ...band.

69
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:34,907
I don't mean to be rude, but I do have
friends and they are coming back.

70
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,910
- Just leave.
- When they come back.

71
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:42,081
- Why not now?
- Then I'll never get to know you,

72
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:47,711
how wonderful you are. I'm serious,
even though I'm giving you a line.

73
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,381
- I'm serious. I know you know that.
- I know that.

74
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,717
From the deepest part of my heart,
which is not too deep.

75
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:01,767
Why don't you just go someplace else
and try it again?

76
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:03,811
All right, I'll...

77
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:21,829
Pardon me. Was that fellow
in the Hawaiian shirt disturbing you?

78
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,833
- I know him. He's crazy.
- Not crazy, just pushy.

79
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,459
You know what he said about you?

80
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,379
- What?
- Nothing.

81
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,094
Stop it.

82
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:49,606
Look... All right. Enough!

83
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,153
Look, I'm going to get serious.

84
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,323
When I saw you, I realized
I fought this war for a reason.

85
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:02,161
When I was in my foxhole,
not knowing whether I'd live or die,

86
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:06,248
in the mud and dirty,
I didn't know anything.

87
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,211
All right?
I'll take only a minute of your time.

88
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,840
Now, when I walked in there, I knew.

89
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,676
- I knew.
- You knew what?

90
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,179
That I wouldn't get
anywhere at this table.

91
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,348
Now I'm impressed.

92
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:31,357
I guess
a little small talk is in order.

93
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:35,611
- Can it get any smaller?
- I can take a hint.

94
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,196
Can you take a walk?

95
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,365
- Shall I leave?
- Yes!

96
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,033
- I'll leave right now.
- Bye.

97
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,869
You expect me to leave after that?

98
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:47,289
- Will you go away?
- I don't want to.

99
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,377
I want to stay here and annoy you.

100
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,173
Go away!

101
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:03,263
Look, let's get down to business.
It's getting a little tiring here.

102
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,725
Give me your phone number
and we'll avoid this.

103
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:10,062
- Why not avoid it anyway?
- What's to be avoided?

104
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,897
- You.
- That cannot be avoided.

105
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:15,442
If you had one ounce of a gentleman
in you, you'd go away.

106
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,363
- Well, I'm not a gentleman.
- That explains everything.

107
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:23,075
Do I look like a gentleman
in this shirt and these pants?

108
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:24,827
Well...

109
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:31,250
- Even a louse would go away.
- Just give me the number.

110
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,419
- What am I going to do with it?
- Call it.

111
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,135
Please.

112

- You think you'll win it?

to London. We had a great time.

- Yeah.

- Where?
- Paul!

- You don't look like...
- Oh, but he's a terrific dancer.

don't you, honey?

Right after the pause, we're going
to switch you to ballroom.

141
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,991
- Where have you been?
- We're over there.

142

- Where are the broads?
- There.

- Are you using your room tonight?
- Of course I'm using my room.

145
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:49,758
- You want to use the room?
- Yeah. I fell in love half an hour ago.

146
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:53,846
I think she's a professional dancer.
She's got some pair of legs.

147
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,015
- How long are you gonna be?
- Maybe an hour.

148
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:59,518
- All right. Use the bathroom.
- OK.

149
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,562
Why didn't you bring them
to the table?

150

There's only two.

151
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,483
- One for me, one for you.
- OK.

152

- Are these the girls?
- Yeah, why?

153

- Right here?
- Yeah.

154

- Which one is yours?
- The blonde.

155

- So I have the brunette?
- Right.

156

She's a pain in the ass.

157
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:27,379
I spent 20 minutes
giving her every routine I knew.

158
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,882
It didn't work. There was nothing.

- The one over there?
- Yeah.

I got the bad one.

I was wounded in action.

00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:06,585
I just got out of the hospital
and I'm shy and nervous.

169
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:10,839
Tell her I'm sensitive.
Lay it on like I'm a war hero.

170
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,592
- OK.
- Not too heavy. Indirect.

171
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,678
I'll wait over here
and then I'll come over.

172
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:19,348
Lay it on real well,
because I want to get her.

173
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:23,519
- Leave this to me, OK?
- All right. Wait, wait!

174
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:25,437
All right, OK.

175
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,107
- Wait, wait.
- What is it?

176
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:32,069
- Tell me what you're going to do.
- Leave it up to me. Take it easy.

177
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:35,781
What about the other thing? Sensitive.

178
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,701
- Sensitive. Sensitive.
- Oh, sensitive.

179
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,619
Oh, right. OK.

180
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,457
- Wait. What am I doing?
- What?

181
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:49,753
For her I'm doing all this?
I'm going with you. Just introduce me.

182
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:55,300
Francine Flannery, Jimmy Doyle.

183
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,262
- Pleased to meet you.
- Ellen Evans.

184
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:01,473
Wrong. I'm Francine Evans,
this is Ellen Flannery.

185
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:05,477
- Remember her? You've been dancing.
- Let's go.

186
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,104
He's such an animal.

187
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,192
- Be careful!
- I'll be right back.

188
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,154
Mind if I sit down now?

189
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:19,158
After all, we've been
formally introduced now.

190
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,326
We're old friends.

191
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,873
If you and I had danced,
it might have been a nice time.

192
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,584
I just gave my hotel key to my friend

193
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:31,045
because he's found someone
he's hooked on.

194
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:35,382
- That's very generous.
- Yeah, I thought so.

195
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,303
It seems
you give things away easily, huh?

196
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,642
- Did you have something in mind?
- For what?

197
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:49,521
For what you just said before.

198
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:53,692
Meaning would I give anything
of myself easily to you,

199
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,402
which I could do very easily.

200
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,571
He'll only be there for an hour or two.

201
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:00,282
Got any Juicy Fruit?

202
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,202
Sure.

203
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:07,539
Bye-bye.

204
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,060
I'll get her.

205
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:35,150
Eddie, if nothing happened
after four hours, why in the next hour?

206
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:38,112
I'm gonna be there in one hour.
That's it. Bye.

207
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:02,720
[Subway trains rattle]

208
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:44,261
[Francine] I'm sure it's Doyle.

209
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:48,307
[Clerk] I'm sorry, there's no Doyle
registered here.

210
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:53,896
A friend of mine is in that room
with a friend of his. Ellen Flannery.

211
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:57,149
It's quite urgent
that I get a hold of her.

212
00:21:57,317 --> 00:22:00,277
- Can't you just look one more time?
- Sure.

213
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,489
She's afraid of heights.

214
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:08,660
If it's too high and she gets dizzy,
it might be awful for your hotel.

215
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:09,828
[Clerk] Naturally.

216
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:16,919
Excuse me. Just a second.
Mr. Powell?

217
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:20,589
- That's him. Mr. Doyle!
- Mr. Powell!

218
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:22,758
- Mr. Doyle!
- Mr. Powell! Which is he?

219
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:25,177
Mr. Doyle. Jimmy Doyle!

220
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:35,145
I'd like to talk to you for a second,
please. Step right over.

221
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:40,067
- Is there a problem?
- Only a minute.

222
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:43,529
- Where's Ellen?
- Fancy meeting you here!

223
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:48,826
Boy, you're a winner. Every time l
run into you, you cause me problems.

224
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,453
- What are you talking about?
- You just ruined it for me.

225
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:57,501
He's calling the manager
because I'm here under an alias.

226
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:59,878
We're all going to get arrested.

227
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:05,175
You'll have to get my suitcase and sax
because I have an audition now.

228
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:08,971
If you mess that up,
I'm going to get even with you.

229
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:12,141
I don't care how,
but I am going to. You ruined it.

230
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,143
- Mr. Powell?
- Get up there now!

231
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:18,063
I'm having a talk with my sister.
Do you mind?

232
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:20,816
- Yes, I do.
- Well, you'll have to wait.

233
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:25,154
Sis... Oh, please, Sis!
Now, Mommy's waiting.

234
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,906
She was worried for a few days...

235
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:31,869
Mr. Powell, please.
You've run up quite a bill with us.

236
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:36,290
- Where were you before coming here?
- Where was l?

237
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,751
- That's right.
- Where were you?

238
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,378
Because you know where I was?
I was in Anzio!

239
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:43,714
Anzio!

240
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,675
I remember it now.

241
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:50,596
- Fine, Mr. Powell.
- Wait, I get carried away. Sorry.

242
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:55,434
Five nights at the Commodore, three at
the St. Regis, room service at each.

243
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:58,896
In one case, use of the limousine.
Why do you switch hotels so often?

244
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,816
How could I even sign these checks?

245
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:06,945
- These are your signatures.
- My signature hand doesn't work.

246
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:10,949
There's no life in that arm.

247
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:14,078
I might have it amputated tomorrow.

248
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:17,581
Do I sign with my left hand?
I'm right-handed.

249
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:19,541
Look at that signature.

250
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:22,252
Your sister will know
your signature, sir.

251
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:26,757
- Is that my signature?
- Yes.

252
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:29,009
- Come on.
- That's your sister.

253
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:31,637
- That's not my signature.
- Yes, it is.

254
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:34,723
She's wacky.
You know, in the W¤Cs.

255
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:38,102
- Yes.
- Sister, you've got to go home.

256
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:40,396
- No!
- 11 West 55th Street.

257
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:43,482
- No! I'm not going to do this.
- Go home now!

258
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,651
- All right!
- Remember Anzio.

259
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:50,698
No, no. It's this way.
And right away.

260
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:53,283
- And I'll meet you later.
- Mr. Powell...

261
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:57,079
This is harassment.
I'm not coming to this hotel.

262
00:24:57,247 --> 00:25:01,166
- I'm going to complain to the manager.
- Would you lower your voice?

263
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:03,293
I think you have a lot of nerve.

264
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:06,380
You see when that happens,
you can't explain why.

265
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:11,468
- You see my leg. It's wood.
- That's terrible.

266
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:13,846
It's the best kind of wood,
but it's a wooden leg.

267
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:18,851
I lost this leg so you could
accuse me of not paying hotel bills.

268
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:22,312
I can't believe this!
Would you push it off, please?

269
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:28,027
- Ellen! Honey, are you all right?
- I'm just great.

270
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:30,070
- Any last words?
- She...

271
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:32,823
- Sorry, did I scare you?
- No.

272
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:40,456
Good luck.
I've had her for three years.

273
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:43,792
She's had every germ known to man,
Di Maggio.

274
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,961
- Di Muzio.
- Is this Jimmy's?

275
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:50,382
Can't you take a joke?

276
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:53,218
Well, take good care of her.

277
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:56,805
- What germs are you talking about?
- Killers.

278
00:25:57,807 --> 00:26:00,684
- This cab is...
- Excuse me, I need...

279
00:26:00,852 --> 00:26:02,644
Forgotten but not gone.

280
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:08,567
- 242...
- Hotel Alcott, please.

281
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:12,029
Just a second.
2842 Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn.

282
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:15,366
- Do you mind if I take this cab?
- Do I have a choice?

283
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:18,160
No. I have an audition. Do you?

284
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:23,540
I'm late for it. Come along.
You have nothing better to do, anyway.

285
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:27,252
- I was thinking of doing my nails.
- Brooklyn, or what?

286
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,839
I just said. It's going to be Brooklyn.
2482 Flatbush Avenue.

287
00:26:32,217 --> 00:26:34,510
2842 Flatbush Avenue.

288
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:36,095
Same thing.

289
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:41,725
What about your nails?
Why don't you do them?

290
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,063
Why are you so serious?

291
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:49,650
Come on, loosen up.

292
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:53,320
Come on.
You gave me a hard time last night.

293
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:55,280
Loosen up a little bit.

294
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:59,785
Oh, come, come.
Let's have some gum.

295
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:03,288
Best way to keep your mouth shut
and keep you occupied.

296
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,082
No, thank you.

297
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:10,212
- You're enjoying this ride.
- I'm having a hell of a time.

298
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:16,135
I'm nervous because of this audition.
It's good to chew. It relaxes me.

299
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:22,641
God, I'm so nervous about this.
You make it worse.

300
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,813
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't say.

301
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:29,982
- You didn't say?
- No.

302
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:34,653
- Would you do me a favor?
- What?

303
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:37,114
- Would you hold something for me?
- What?

304
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:42,411
- Give me your hand. For good luck.
- For good luck?

305
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:45,956
Ooh, that's very funny!

306
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:48,334
You've got a good sense
of humor, kid.

307
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:53,297
Oh, I can't believe it.

308
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:58,177
I want to ask you something.

309
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:01,388
You want to know what interests me
the most, Frances?

310
00:28:03,683 --> 00:28:07,686
One is music,
number two is money

311
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:09,646
and number three is...

312
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:14,360
I got it.

313
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:19,406
Uh-huh. Got it.

314
00:28:19,574 --> 00:28:21,575
- What's the matter?
- I don't want it.

315
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:26,413
- Are they always in that order?
- Sure, unless...

316
00:28:27,165 --> 00:28:31,377
...you come across someone who grooves
you and you want to groove with.

317
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:33,504
Say, you.

318
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:37,758
If things work out and you start
acting more intelligent,

319
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:43,722
then possibly I'll make number three
number one, number one number three

320
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,558
and number two...

321
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:50,729
No, wait. Now I'm getting confused.

322
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:55,442
- You put it where...
- You put it where number three is.

323
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:59,905
That's... Wait, let me start
all over again. Let me get this...

324
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:04,451
- Three would be one...
- Then two is three.

325
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:09,623
Exactly. And when you have that,
you have what you call a major chord.

326
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:14,753
- What's a major chord?
- When everything works out perfectly,

327
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:18,090
when you have everything you want.

328
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:20,551
The woman you want,
the music you want

329
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:24,763
and enough money to live comfortably.
That's a major chord.

01:00:41,933 --> 01:00:45,686
Then, I was jiving you.
I mean it. I'm going to pack it in.

663
01:00:45,854 --> 01:00:50,315
You remember we used to go out
and do 80, 85 one-nighters in a row.

664
01:00:50,483 --> 01:00:51,400
Yeah.

665
01:00:51,568 --> 01:00:54,403
Those joints aren't
ballrooms any more.

666
01:00:54,571 --> 01:01:00,159
They're parking lots, skating rinks.
The theatres are all bombed out.

667
01:01:01,286 --> 01:01:05,289
I've thought about letting
somebody else front the band,

668
01:01:05,457 --> 01:01:07,249
take a piece of the action.

669
01:01:07,417 --> 01:01:10,669
I wouldn't have to lift a finger.

670
01:01:10,837 --> 01:01:13,213
But only one guy can front this band.

671
01:01:13,381 --> 01:01:15,507
I know. Jimmy, right?

672
01:01:15,675 --> 01:01:18,010
No. Me.

673
01:01:18,678 --> 01:01:23,891
And if I go, the band goes.
It's game over. You know that.

674
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:27,353
- Sure you won't have a little taste?
- No, you have it.

675
01:01:28,063 --> 01:01:29,480
Beautiful. I will.

676
01:01:32,484 --> 01:01:35,778
Maybe Jimmy would consider...

677
01:01:36,363 --> 01:01:39,031
You said he's good.
You think he's good.

678
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:43,702
He's not only good, baby.
He blows a barrelful of tenor.

679
01:01:44,704 --> 01:01:48,457
- But he's a pain in the ass.
- I don't want to start this argument.

680
01:01:50,502 --> 01:01:53,170
But he's a top pain in the ass.

681
01:01:53,338 --> 01:01:55,214
Top pain in the ass.

682
01:01:55,548 --> 01:01:58,175
You want to say it three times for luck?

683
01:01:58,343 --> 01:02:00,386
Three is my favorite number.

684
01:02:00,553 --> 01:02:02,888
Top pain in the ass.

685
01:02:06,351 --> 01:02:08,894
You're right. But he's good.

687
01:02:14,818 --> 01:02:19,405
I'm sorry, Mr. Doyle.
It's not quite what I had in mind.

688
01:02:19,572 --> 01:02:21,031
Yeah. Sorry, fellows.

689
01:02:29,749 --> 01:02:32,751
Mr. Horace,
I know it's not Frankie Harte.

690
01:02:32,919 --> 01:02:36,839
We can do that stuff, too.
Just give us another chance.

691
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:41,468
This guy must be crazy. I made a deal
with Frankie Harte and his Orchestra,

692
01:02:41,636 --> 01:02:45,305
not Jimmy Doyle
and his Flying Sack O' Maniacs.

693
01:02:45,473 --> 01:02:48,809
This is Frankie Harte and his Orchestra,
without Frankie.

694
01:02:48,977 --> 01:02:51,562
Frankie wouldn't give us the band
if it wouldn't work.

695
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:54,982
- That's true.
- What do you have to lose?

696
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:59,278
What do I have to lose?
Does this look like a peanut gallery?

697
01:02:59,446 --> 01:03:02,573
It looks like a place
that needs someone like me.

698
01:03:04,284 --> 01:03:08,203
- Give us half a chance.
- Where's the girl singer?

699
01:03:08,371 --> 01:03:11,206
- Is she stunning, blonde?
- Stunning, blonde.

700
01:03:11,374 --> 01:03:13,959
- She walks, she talks...
- She'd better be good.

701
01:03:14,586 --> 01:03:15,586
Right, number 358.

702
01:03:16,421 --> 01:03:17,963
Horace, have you gone crazy?

703
01:03:20,133 --> 01:03:21,633
Why do you want
to listen to the singer?

704
01:03:21,801 --> 01:03:24,511
Of course I'm crazy. How do you
think I wound up in this business?

How have you been?
What are you doing?

1005
01:25:53,945 --> 01:25:59,283
I went on the road with Frankie Harte,
then I took the band over myself.

1006
01:26:00,326 --> 01:26:03,328
- Kind of slipped away.
- No. You heard that?

1007
01:26:03,496 --> 01:26:06,457
Yeah. A little talk about it
around here.

1008
01:26:06,624 --> 01:26:09,626
No, it didn't slip away.
What happened was, you know...

1009
01:26:10,795 --> 01:26:12,546
I was working with bad musicians.

I wonder if I should be back here.

Listen, man,
I've got a little thing going

1013
01:26:26,478 --> 01:26:29,313
- over at the Harlem Club.
- Oh, yeah.

1014
01:26:29,481 --> 01:26:32,232
Some really good cats.
Come over.

1015
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,735
I will. I've heard a lot about it.

1016
01:26:34,903 --> 01:26:36,236
- One problem, though.
- What?

1017
01:26:37,155 --> 01:26:39,698

I always used to tell you about?

We'd better go to lunch.
I'll explain to you there.

so get in and I'll explain.

- You remember Cecil Powell?
- Yes.

1030
01:29:33,373 --> 01:29:37,960
I met him and went to Harlem,

I'd still be with the band. Right?
