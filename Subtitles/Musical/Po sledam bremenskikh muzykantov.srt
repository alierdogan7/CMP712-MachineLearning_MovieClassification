1
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,100
I am the great detective

2
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,500
I take advice from none

3
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,800
I’ll even find a pimple

4
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,600
On a giant elephant

5
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,500
I do fight like a lion

6
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,500
I do work like a bee

7
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,500
My dog-like nose sniffs so fine 

8
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,500
My eagle-eye can see.

9
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,700
My iron hand is dreadful

10
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,500
You’ll tremble and you’ll flee

11
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,200
And it’s completely futile

12
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,500
To hide away from me

13
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,100
More agile than a monkey

14
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,500
More mighty than a whale

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,900
My dog-like nose knows something 

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,500
My eagle-eye can’t fail.

17
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,500
I’ve been to many places

18
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,700
I’m up to any task

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,500
Soon all your pretty faces

20
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,100
Are gonna be unmasked

21
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,500
I vanish in the twilight

22
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,500
I dive and swim so deep


23
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,500
My dog-like nose stands upright

24
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,900
My eagle-eye can peep

25
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,900
These days children are so selfish

26
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,100
There’s no way to keep them docile

27
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,100
We spend all our nerves on them

28
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,500
But they spit on it in return

29
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,600
Oh, she is so naughty, she ran from palace mad!

30
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,900
Oh, she is so naughty—she so upset her dad!

31
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,700
These days children are demanding

32
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,200
But they can’t be repremanded

33
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,900
They want song and dance till dawn

34
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,900
From parents  they got too withdrawn 

35
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,100
Oh, she is so naughty, she ran from palace mad!

36
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,600
Oh, sheis so naughty—she so upset her dad!

36
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,600
Children are indeed our penance 

37
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,600
They’re a misbehaving menace

38
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,600
Since we bought them costly tutors

39
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,100
Still, without them life is stupor

40
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,100
Oh, she is so naughty, she ran from palace mad!

41
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,300
Oh, sheis so naughty—she so upset her dad!

42
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:27,100
Sun’s ray so pure and golden

43
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,100
Clouds trapped behind their shroud

44
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:38,100
And  now this wall has stolen

45
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:43,900
That union we’d avowed

46
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:55,100
Night will pass, come morning bright and clear

47
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,100
Trust that happiness awaits us

48
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,500
Night will pass, will pass these times of fear

49
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,500
The sun shall then rise

50
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:15,500
The sun shall then rise

51
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:22,100
Birds ceased their song till morning

52
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,100
Stars touch our roofs with light

53
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,100
Through whirlwinds of our mourning

54
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:39,500
Do hear my voice tonight

55
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:51,200
Night will pass, come morning bright and clear

56
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:56,100
Trust that happiness awaits us

57
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,500
Night will pass, will pass these times of fear

58
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,500
The sun shall then rise

59
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,500
The sun shall then rise

60
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,100
Why, you are my little poor troubadummy child

61
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,800
How your figure has thinned out after all this while

62
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,500
Rest in comfort of your father and king


63
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,500
--I   d o  n o t  w a n t  a n y t h i n g!

64
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,800
Your hysterical condition is dangerous

65
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,600
Have a dietetic egg to encourage us

66
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,600
Maybe doctors can prescribe you a pill?

67
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:36,600
--T h i s   i s  q u i t e   a g a i n s t   m y   w i l l!

68
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:49,600
Why, my princess drowned in sorrowful fantasies

69
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,600
Soon we’ll have ourselves musicians from overseas

70
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,600
Choose among them whom your heart may desire 

71
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:04,600
--I   d o  n o t  w a n t  a n y,  S i r e!

72
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,600
Perhaps we have no household of our own

73
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,400
But we don’t pay a dime to tax collectors

74
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,600
We’re laborers of  knife as well as axe

75
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,300
Romantics always living on the road

76
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,100
We don’t want to live any other way

77
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,100
We don’t want to live any other way

78
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,100
We walk on the edge, we walk on the edge

79
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:13,300
We walk on our precious edge

80
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,100
We roam around from morning until dawn

81
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,600
Somebody else’s boots give our feet blisters

82
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,300
We’re laborers of  knife as well as axe

83
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,100
Romantics living freely on the road

84
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,100
We don’t want to live any other way

85
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,100
We don’t want to live any other way

86
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,100
We walk on the edge, we walk on the edge

87
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,100
We walk on our precious edge

88
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,100
Our feet are licked by tongues of fire all night

89
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,200
Why don’t these touchy-feely people love us

90
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,100
Us laborers of knife as well as axe,

91
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,100
Romantics living freely on the road

92
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:15,100
We don't want to live any other way... We are walking on edge...

93
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,100
The whole world’s in our hands
We’re stars so well-reputed

94
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,100
And we will pulverize
Competitors and suitors

95
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:15,100
We came to you just for a bit
Privyet, Bon Jour, Hello

96
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:21,100
Now fall in love with us and quick
You’re in great luck, you know!

97
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:28,100
And now, my dears
Lend me your ears

98
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:35,100
And perhaps you’d better
Clap for us together

99
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,100
When we begin to sing
All eyes with joy do weep

100
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,100
And we already know
That things are meant to be 

101
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,100
We came to you just for a bit
Privyet, Bon Jour, Hello

102
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:02,100
Now fall in love with us and quick
You’re in great luck, you know!


103
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,100
And now, my dears
Lend me your ears

104
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:16,100
And perhaps you’d better
Clap for us together

105
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:49,100
Rocka, rocka, rocka bye
Don’t sleep on the edge, good night

106
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:56,100
On the edge I always sleep
And no bad dreams ever creep

107
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:03,100
Rocka, rocka, rocka bye
Don’t sleep on the edge, good night

108
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:11,100
I can’t sleep next to the wall
My knees press 'cause I’m so tall


109
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,100
Think on edge I’ll lie
Don’t lie there!


110
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,100
Gonna sleep so nice
Don’t lie there!


111
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,700
Gonna make you cry
Don’t lie there, don’t lie there!

112
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:30,500
A grey wolf will come at night
And will take of you a bite

113
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,100
THE END
