I'm bored.

16
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,240
Ladi, I am at a loss.

17
00:01:06,307 --> 00:01:08,158
Brittany, please remind me

18
00:01:08,243 --> 00:01:10,477
of how I single-handedly
put cheerleading on the map.

19
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:13,313
In 1979, you directed
a made-for-TV movie

20
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,082
about the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders

21
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:17,134
<i>called The Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders.</i>

22
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,318
That is correct.

23
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,320
And in the meantime, what's changed?

24
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:21,988
Personal grooming habits?

25
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,708
What's changed is I have
completely lost interest.

26
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,511
And ladies, I blame you.

27
00:01:27,595 --> 00:01:28,896
Becky- more
silicone falsies.

28
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,931
Got it, Coach.

29
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:32,432
You will each enhance your
bust with an additional

30
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,550
pair of chicken cutlets,

31
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,219
in an attempt to add some jiggle

32
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:39,323
to what is the most boring
routine I have ever witnessed.

33
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,342
But Coach Sylvester, this
is the most elaborate routine

34
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,427
the Cheerios! have ever done.

35
00:01:43,495 --> 00:01:44,895
We're shoo-ins at Regionals next week,

36
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,630
and we're the favorite
to win at Nationals.

37
00:01:46,698 --> 00:01:50,450
And yet I am still so very bored.

38
00:01:50,518 --> 00:01:54,738
Even things I used to
think were hilarious...

39
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,323
Case in point.

40
00:01:56,374 --> 00:01:59,042
Sandbags, slap yourself
with a chicken cutlet.

41
00:02:00,962 --> 00:02:02,963
Now slap Brittany.

42
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,048
See? Not even a chuckle.

43
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:06,667
The problem is you keep trying

44
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:07,751
to make a bigger and bigger spectacle.

45
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,837
No matter how hard we try,

46
00:02:09,888 --> 00:02:11,705
we can't make a routine
work unless you find a way

47
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,307
to make it interesting for you.

48
00:02:13,374 --> 00:02:15,492
You have to find a way to top yourself.

49
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,011
Q, you just may have a point.

50
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:22,499
But to be sure, slap yourself
with a chicken cutlet.

52
00:02:33,394 --> 00:02:35,562
All right, I just want to take a minute

53
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,915
to tell you guys how proud of you I am.

54
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:39,900
We didn't even have to win this game

55
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,586
to go to championship next
week, but nobody took it off.

56
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,038
When we take a knee, we're
gonna finish first in conference

57
00:02:45,089 --> 00:02:46,373
for the first time in McKinley history.

58
00:02:46,424 --> 00:02:48,091
Football is back, bitches!

59
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,745
Maybe we should all break
out into a song after we win.

60
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,747
Hey, shut it, Karofsky. No fricking way.

61
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,849
I figure if I stay on
you, you'll run away

62
00:02:55,917 --> 00:02:56,850
like your little butt buddy Hummel.

63
00:02:56,918 --> 00:02:58,268
That's funny, Karofsky,

64
00:02:58,353 --> 00:02:59,920
how you're calling
everybody gay all the time,

65
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,438
but you never seem to have a girlfriend.

66
00:03:03,608 --> 00:03:06,310
It's okay. It's okay.

67
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,945
I really hope that linebacker
doesn't get the jump on me.

68
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:11,097
I bet it would hurt like
hell to get sacked by him.

69
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:16,153
Break! TEAM: Break!

70
00:03:18,105 --> 00:03:19,623
All right.

71
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:21,708
Slow left on one.

72
00:03:21,776 --> 00:03:23,493
Ready? Break! TEAM: Break!

73
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,212
Come on, boys. Let's go.

74
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,174
Down!

75
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,291
Set!

76
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,594
Whoo!

77
00:03:43,648 --> 00:03:45,098
(growlin

78
00:03:45,149 --> 00:03:46,600
Hut!

79
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:58,812
Nice hands.

80
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,451
What a joke.

81
00:04:04,502 --> 00:04:06,003
What the hell happened?!

82
00:04:06,087 --> 00:04:07,621
Finn, you're the captain, talk!

83
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:09,155
Karofsky sucks, that's what happened!

84
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,258
That's crap! Hudson's a frickin' girl

85
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:13,460
and couldn't take a joke
about his precious Glee Club.

86
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:15,462
Because I'm sick of you guys
getting down on us for it.

87
00:04:15,513 --> 00:04:17,330
We're in Glee Club. What's the big deal?

88
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,499
It's embarrassing! We're dudes!

89
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,817
Getting all hot and bothered

90
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,670
about singing a Ke$ha
song? It's freakin' weird.

91
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:24,855
Yeah? Well, maybe
you'll think it's cooler

92
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:26,139
when I go all TiK ToK on your face.

93
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,274
Bring it, Puckerman.

94
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,179
That's enough! That's enough!

95
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,116
Championship game or not,
I am not blocking for him.

96
00:04:37,351 --> 00:04:38,402
Get the hell out of here!

97
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,486
Fine! Go!

98
00:04:39,537 --> 00:04:41,154
Good! Bunch of babies!

99
00:04:45,043 --> 00:04:48,095
<i>Dear Journal, I am in crisis.</i>

100
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,880
<i>Not even the can't-lose combination</i>

101
00:04:49,947 --> 00:04:52,699
<i>of boobs and fire can
get me going anymore.</i>

102
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,302
<i>Is it the raccoon hormones
my new doctor gave me?</i>

103
00:04:55,369 --> 00:04:56,887
<i>Maybe.</i>

104
00:04:56,971 --> 00:05:00,223
<i>Here I am, 31, and already a legend.</i>

105
00:05:00,308 --> 00:05:03,226
<i>What do I do as a second act?</i>

106
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:05,762
<i>I'm simply at a loss. Last week,</i>

107
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,849
<i>I even took to modifying
my own flawless form</i>

108
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,901
<i>just to feel something. Wait.</i>

109
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:14,821
It's Syv-lester,
right? Sue Syv-lester?

110
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:16,556
<i>How do I make things interesting again?</i>

111
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:19,659
<i>How do I get those juices flowing?</i>

112
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,204
That's it.

113
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:41,765
This here is the A950.

114
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:44,434
You say this could shoot
someone across a football field?

115
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:48,271
Several football fields, if
you pack in enough explosives.

116
00:05:48,356 --> 00:05:52,192
Of course, that would
be incredibly unsafe.

117
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:55,095
See, if you want to go for
more than, say, 50 yards,

118
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:58,598
you're looking about a 70% chance

119
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,817
of catastrophic failure.

120
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:05,038
Which is a 30% chance
of catastrophic success.

121
00:06:05,106 --> 00:06:06,873
This is the button,
right? No, no, no, no!

122
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,470
You know, I try to make it a habit

123
00:06:20,555 --> 00:06:23,173
of not touching carny folk, but fella...

124
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,391
I'll take it.

125
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,842
You got a smaller one?

126
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,844
I'll check stock.

127
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,964
I'm back.

128
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,349
So I was going through my bucket list

129
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,850
and I noticed you were
the only Glee loser

130
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,735
that I haven't slushied yet.

131
00:06:35,803 --> 00:06:36,903
Damn near broke his heart.

132
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:38,271
Well, what about the moral implications

133
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:39,639
of abusing a kid in a wheelchair?

134
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,857
I say, equal opportunity for all.

135
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,534
This stuff between the
jocks and the Glee Club

136
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,702
has been going on since I
started running the club.

137
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,504
Maybe.

138
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:56,790
It just seems like it's
so much worse right now.

139
00:06:56,841 --> 00:06:59,960
I've won division championships
at three different schools.

140
00:07:00,011 --> 00:07:02,546
You have to understand
what winning means

141
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,680
to a community. Grades go up,

142
00:07:03,764 --> 00:07:06,833
the streets are
cleaner, crime goes down.

143
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,186
It's a sense of pride, of unity.

144
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,138
And this school deserves that.

145
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:12,806
And you are going to get it for us.

146
00:07:12,857 --> 00:07:14,841
I mean, you won almost
every game this year.

147
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,226
Winning conference was easy.

148
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,812
The team we're up
against for championship-

149
00:07:18,863 --> 00:07:20,197
they're much better than us.

150
00:07:20,281 --> 00:07:23,016
If you don't have thtalent,
you re on the chemistry.

151
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,451
They don't have to like each other,

152
00:07:24,518 --> 00:07:26,369
but they have to respect each other.

153
00:07:26,454 --> 00:07:28,004
This whole thing is just so weird.

154
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:29,956
I mean, half of your
starters are in my Glee Club.

155
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:31,441
I just don't know what to do.

156
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,094
Do you trust me?

157
00:07:34,145 --> 00:07:36,062
You're not going to try
and kiss me again, are you?

158
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,181
If you trust me,

159
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:41,518
I think I know a way to
get your team united again.

160
00:07:41,602 --> 00:07:42,519
Really fast.

161
00:07:42,603 --> 00:07:44,321
Oh, my
God- Artie!

162
00:07:45,323 --> 00:07:47,107
It was awful.

163
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:48,191
That's it! Screw rehearsal!

164
00:07:48,276 --> 00:07:50,443
This ends here and now.

165
00:07:50,494 --> 00:07:52,829
We're gonna go all
Thunderdome on those guys.

166
00:07:52,914 --> 00:07:56,533
So this is what the ladies
lounge looks like on the inside.

167
00:07:56,617 --> 00:07:57,951
This is the choir room.
Now, put up your fists

168
00:07:58,002 --> 00:07:58,952
because you and I are
going to do some dancing.

169
00:07:59,003 --> 00:08:01,004
No, I got this, Sam.

170
00:08:01,088 --> 00:08:02,756
Coach Beiste told us
to come. Where is she?

171
00:08:02,823 --> 00:08:05,491
Watch it. Everyone, have a seat.

172
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:06,626
You, too, guys.

173
00:08:06,677 --> 00:08:08,494
All right, New Directions!,

174
00:08:08,546 --> 00:08:11,131
let's give a warm welcome to
the newest members of Glee Club.

175
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:14,050
Oh, hell to the no, Mr. Shue.

176
00:08:14,135 --> 00:08:15,936
Hey! Come on!

177
00:08:16,003 --> 00:08:17,470
Guys! Hey!

178
00:08:17,521 --> 00:08:18,855
Are you serious? These are the
guys that made Kurt transfer.

179
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,640
And there's no way that
I'm sharing the choir room

180
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:22,025
with a known homophobe.

181
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:23,894
I don't disagree with you guys.

182
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:25,362
But I talked to Coach Beiste about it,

183
00:08:25,446 --> 00:08:27,981
and she and I both agreed
that the kind of bullying

184
00:08:28,032 --> 00:08:29,449
that David does is
born out of ignorance.

185
00:08:29,516 --> 00:08:32,452
Having him in here, as
difficult as it may be for us,

186
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:35,739
is an opportunity to show
him and the rest of the guys

187
00:08:35,823 --> 00:08:37,040
that being in Glee
Club is kind of cool-

188
00:08:37,124 --> 00:08:40,043
find some common ground.

189
00:08:40,127 --> 00:08:41,527
All of you are going to be in
this Glee Club for one week,

190
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:43,046
no exceptions.

191
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,465
She's bluffing- next week
is the championship game.

192
00:08:45,532 --> 00:08:46,666
Without us, shhas no team.

193
00:08:46,717 --> 00:08:48,251
With you, I have no team!

194
00:08:48,336 --> 00:08:50,670
You guys have gotta find
a way to come together

195
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:52,555
or we're going to get
our asses kicked from here

196
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,507
until Tuesday finds a
saddlebag full of buckwheat.

197
00:08:57,261 --> 00:08:59,379
If I have to stay, I'm
not singing no show tunes.

198
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,981
That is the music of my oppressors.

199
00:09:01,048 --> 00:09:02,933
Do you even have any
idea what we do in here?

200
00:09:03,017 --> 00:09:04,768
No. None of them do.

201
00:09:04,852 --> 00:09:06,653
We have to show them.

202
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,355
Rachel, Puck, haven't you
guys been working on something?

203
00:09:08,406 --> 00:09:09,823
Why don't you give it a whirl?

204
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:12,409
Fine. As offended as I
am by their presence here,

205
00:09:12,493 --> 00:09:14,494
I won't let anything get
in the way of a performance.

00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:52,718
Funny. Yeah, man. That's good.

232
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,021
Hey!

233
00:11:55,072 --> 00:11:56,656
Hey, get back.

234
00:11:58,492 --> 00:12:00,276
Great first day, right?

235
00:12:00,361 --> 00:12:01,428
Awesome.

236
00:12:01,495 --> 00:12:02,395
Let me at that guy!

237
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,874
- Hey.
- Hey.

238
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,960
We used to be best friends...

239
00:12:12,027 --> 00:12:13,694
before I got your girlfriend pregnant,

240
00:12:13,746 --> 00:12:15,997
and then made out with
your other girlfriend and...

241
00:12:16,048 --> 00:12:17,532
Yeah.

242
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,168
Anyways... I gotta be honest.

243
00:12:20,219 --> 00:12:22,387
I really want to win this game,
and I figure it's the only way

244
00:12:22,471 --> 00:12:25,223
us Glee studs are ever gonna
get any respect around here.

245
00:12:25,307 --> 00:12:26,558
What's your point?

246
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,943
My point is that none
of that's gonna happen

247
00:12:29,011 --> 00:12:31,396
unless you and I become
allies again, like

248
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,314
<i>Maverick and Iceman
at the end of Top Gun.</i>

249
00:12:33,382 --> 00:12:36,551
So why'd youing that duet with Rachel?

250
00:12:36,602 --> 00:12:40,655
I need you to do this number
with me to make Finn jealous.

251
00:12:40,723 --> 00:12:43,024
Nothing like that
will ever happen again.

252
00:12:43,075 --> 00:12:45,159
You lead, and I got your back.

253
00:12:45,227 --> 00:12:47,245
We need to win this
championship and become legends.

254
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,236
Ladies, my "Sue-clear" Weapon.

255
00:12:55,287 --> 00:12:56,671
Becky.

256
00:13:00,593 --> 00:13:02,594
Brittany...

257
00:13:02,678 --> 00:13:03,911
Climb on up.

258
00:13:03,963 --> 00:13:05,346
Congratulations.

259
00:13:05,414 --> 00:13:08,550
You're doing this stunt
for the big competition.

260
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:12,103
I don't want to die yet.

261
00:13:12,187 --> 00:13:14,022
<i>At least not until One
Tree Hill gets cancelled.</i>

262
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:15,890
Fine.

263
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:19,527
To put your toddler, fist-sized
mind at ease, we'll do one

264
00:13:19,595 --> 00:13:21,112
final test run.

265
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:37,945
Any of you take German?

266
00:13:37,997 --> 00:13:39,780
I may have to read

267
00:13:39,832 --> 00:13:42,133
the owner's manual.

268
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,788
Don't worry, I'll talk to Mr.
Shue and take care of this.

269
00:13:49,124 --> 00:13:50,975
Sue, what the hell were you thinking?

270
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,962
You cannot perform a
stunt that dangerous!

271
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:56,431
Our insurance premium is
through the roof as it is!

272
00:13:56,482 --> 00:13:58,016
Cheerleading is a sport.

273
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,734
There are dangers involved.

274
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:01,436
The same as when a quarterback

275
00:14:01,487 --> 00:14:03,237
is sacked, or a hockey player is

276
00:14:03,305 --> 00:14:04,572
slammed up against the boards.

277
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,107
Enough, Sue.

278
00:14:06,158 --> 00:14:08,142
There is no excuse for putting
a student's life at risk.

279
00:14:08,193 --> 00:14:10,295
I'm a tastemaker, Will.

280
00:14:10,362 --> 00:14:11,913
I know what an audience wants.

281
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:13,931
You are not going to
take this away from me.

282
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:15,533
I need this.

283
00:14:15,618 --> 00:14:19,087
This level of risk and danger
makes me feel alive again.

284
00:14:19,154 --> 00:14:20,922
But the risk and danger isn't to you!

285
00:14:20,989 --> 00:14:22,323
That's the best part.

286
00:14:22,374 --> 00:14:24,425
Enough! It's decided.

287
00:14:24,493 --> 00:14:26,344
You are not allowed to fire yone

288
00:14:26,428 --> 00:14:28,162
out of that cannon
without their consent!

289
00:14:35,437 --> 00:14:36,504
Huh.

290
00:14:45,847 --> 00:14:47,732
It's coming out of

291
00:14:47,816 --> 00:14:49,567
your paycheck-
every penny of it!

292
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:59,043
Oh, God! It's a lawsuit.

293
00:14:59,128 --> 00:15:01,028
I'm telling you, I wish
you could have seen it.

294
00:15:09,871 --> 00:15:10,705
Sort of like that.

295
00:15:23,435 --> 00:15:25,553
What the hell are you doing?

296
00:15:25,604 --> 00:15:28,055
I'm seing a message.

297
00:15:28,107 --> 00:15:29,907
Sue Sylvester's done playing nice.

298
00:15:29,992 --> 00:15:34,278
I just got off the phone with
the Ohio Cheerleading Board,

299
00:15:34,363 --> 00:15:37,615
and they accepted my
request to move my regional

300
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,067
to the same night as
your championship game.

301
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:41,753
Congratulations.

302
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,289
You just lost your halftime
show and the cheerleaders.

303
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:49,544
Sue!

304
00:15:54,082 --> 00:15:55,916
What the crap are we gonna do now?

305
00:16:00,422 --> 00:16:02,923
I got it.

306
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:04,392
No frickin' way! WILL:
We don't have a choice.

307
00:16:04,443 --> 00:16:06,527
Sue pulled the Cheerios! from the game,

308
00:16:06,595 --> 00:16:08,696
so if we don't do it,
there's no halftime show.

309
00:16:08,764 --> 00:16:10,114
And this is a problem because?

310
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:12,266
It's not a problem. It's an opportunity.

311
00:16:12,317 --> 00:16:14,268
Opportunity to humiliate
ourselves. BEISTE: Hey!

312
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:17,288
the whole point of this week
was to bring you guys together;

313
00:16:17,372 --> 00:16:18,939
to bring the school together.
Wait- so you want us

314
00:16:18,991 --> 00:16:21,826
to play the first half,
change into some "sequeen"

315
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,661
ball gowns, and then

316
00:16:23,746 --> 00:16:26,748
go out and do the halftime show
at our own championship game?

317
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:30,168
Yes. It's the championship game!

318
00:16:30,252 --> 00:16:31,753
This is a crazy town. Crazy.

319
00:16:31,804 --> 00:16:33,454
This is crazy! What about
the Cheerios! in Glee Club?

320
00:16:33,505 --> 00:16:34,889
They have a choice.

321
00:16:34,956 --> 00:16:36,758
Us, or the Cheerios! competition.

322
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:39,977
Well, obviously, Quinn is gonna
choose the Cheerios! I mean...

323
00:16:40,062 --> 00:16:42,180
Well, that's not fair. You
don't know what she's goa.

324
00:16:42,264 --> 00:16:43,464
I think the
cheerleading competition

325
00:16:43,515 --> 00:16:45,149
is gonna be a lot of fun, but if you go,

326
00:16:45,234 --> 00:16:46,601
you're gonna miss out

327
00:16:46,652 --> 00:16:49,303
on us doing the most
iconic song of all time.

328
00:16:49,354 --> 00:16:52,306
The Super Bowl
of pop anthems-

329
00:16:52,357 --> 00:16:54,141
"Thriller. "

330
00:16:54,193 --> 00:16:56,077
Yeah!

331
00:16:56,144 --> 00:16:58,112
Yeah, remember a few years ago.

332
00:16:58,163 --> 00:16:59,797
when that Philippine prison did that

333
00:16:59,865 --> 00:17:01,799
mega performance of "Thriller"
and put it on YouTube?

334
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:04,252
In the four months it took
to rehearse that number,

335
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,337
prisoner-on-prisoner
crime dropped

336
00:17:06,421 --> 00:17:07,839
80%.

337
00:17:07,923 --> 00:17:10,708
Doing that, together, as a team,

338
00:17:10,793 --> 00:17:13,211
created a unity within that prison.

339
00:17:13,295 --> 00:17:15,346
And that's what I'm looking to do here.

340
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,681
I mean, don't get
me wrong, you know-

341
00:17:16,765 --> 00:17:18,182
I'm big on Michael
and everything-

342
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:20,501
but isn't that kind of what
they're expecting us to do

343
00:17:20,552 --> 00:17:22,220
Which is why we're
gonna mash it together

344
00:17:22,304 --> 00:17:24,171
with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs'
equally spooky single

345
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,190
"Heads Will Roll. "

346
00:17:28,644 --> 00:17:29,610
Who's Yeah Yeah Yeah?

347
00:17:29,678 --> 00:17:30,945
All right, New Directions!, Titans,

348
00:17:31,012 --> 00:17:33,681
we're going to Zombie Camp.

349
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,804
Uh, five, six, seven, eight.

350
00:17:46,562 --> 00:17:48,363
Time out.

351
00:17:48,448 --> 00:17:50,065
Time out. Time out.
Hey. Hey.

352
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:51,149
Knock it off!

353
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,200
Okay, guys.

354
00:17:52,285 --> 00:17:53,368
It's good, but let's...

355
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:54,569
put a little life into it.

356
00:17:54,654 --> 00:17:55,954
But we're dead.

357
00:17:56,022 --> 00:17:58,040
Then put some afterlife into it.

358
00:17:58,124 --> 00:18:00,792
t out of your heads and get
into your aracters, all right?

359
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:03,194
Very creative. I like that.

360
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:09,034
Five, six, seven, eight.

361
00:18:15,725 --> 00:18:17,759
All right! Nice progress, guys.

362
00:18:17,844 --> 00:18:19,261
Now let's take a
breather, and I'll see you

363
00:18:19,345 --> 00:18:20,479
in the choir room in five minutes,

364
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:21,763
for a lesson in zombie makeup.

365
00:18:21,848 --> 00:18:23,482
Makeup?!? No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

366
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:24,816
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

367
00:18:24,884 --> 00:18:26,234
Yes, yes, yes. Hey, Dave.

368
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:28,270
Talk to you for a second?

369
00:18:28,354 --> 00:18:29,771
Look, I know I'm bad.

370
00:18:29,856 --> 00:18:32,657
Can you just spare me, so
can we get through this?

371
00:18:32,725 --> 00:18:35,027
That's not what I was
going to say at all.

372
00:18:35,078 --> 00:18:36,227
You're actually really good.

373
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:37,829
If you took that energy

374
00:18:37,897 --> 00:18:40,231
you used bullying people
and put it into this,

375
00:18:40,283 --> 00:18:42,501
you'd be one of most
talented guys in the school.

376
00:18:42,568 --> 00:18:45,570
Just think about it.

377
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:53,378
...makeup artist.

378
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:55,847
I am brilliant.

379
00:18:55,915 --> 00:18:57,248
It's actually decent.

380
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,267
It's all right.

381
00:19:03,523 --> 00:19:05,440
I took a makeup class.

382
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:07,359
Hey, I need to talk to you.

383
00:19:07,426 --> 00:19:08,660
Can we not fight for just one day?

384
00:19:08,728 --> 00:19:10,095
Man, it's already hard enough

385
00:19:10,146 --> 00:19:12,064
not to kick you in the
nuts every time I see you.

386
00:19:12,115 --> 00:19:14,483
You think maybe we should do
a warm-up number or something

387
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:17,903
before we do that big
"Thriller" thing at halftime?

388
00:19:17,954 --> 00:19:20,539
You know, I figure the only way
I'm gonna keep any street cred

389
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:22,157
around here after dancing
around like an idiot

390
00:19:22,241 --> 00:19:24,709
in front of the whole school
is if we kick ass at it.

391
00:19:24,777 --> 00:19:26,711
Uh...

392
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:28,713
yeah... couldn't agree more.

393
00:19:33,386 --> 00:19:35,303
Zombie camp was funner than I expected.

394
00:19:35,388 --> 00:19:37,389
And the glee club together
with the football team-

395
00:19:37,456 --> 00:19:39,391
it's like a double rainbow.

396
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,892
A zombie double rainbow.

397
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,177
What the hell are we gonna do?

398
00:19:42,261 --> 00:19:43,145
If we go to our
cheerleading competition,

399
00:19:43,229 --> 00:19:45,013
then we miss the halftime show,

400
00:19:45,098 --> 00:19:46,515
and we're out of Glee Club.

401
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,066
I'm torn.

402
00:19:48,134 --> 00:19:50,235
Oh, I'm not. I'm
Brittany.

403
00:19:50,302 --> 00:19:53,138
Couldn't help but
overhear your conversation.

404
00:19:53,189 --> 00:19:54,573
What were you doing in there?

405
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,458
Enjoying the eavesdropping afforded me

406
00:19:56,526 --> 00:19:58,443
by the Swiss-timepiece regularity

407
00:19:58,494 --> 00:19:59,644
and utter silence

408
00:19:59,695 --> 00:20:03,248
of my 2:00 p. m. ninja poops.

409
00:20:03,315 --> 00:20:06,651
Well, I typed these up for you ladies,

410
00:20:06,702 --> 00:20:08,703
requiring your signature,

411
00:20:08,788 --> 00:20:11,506
tendering your resignation
from the Glee Club.

412
00:20:11,591 --> 00:20:14,759
Oh, and Brittany, here's a note for you,

413
00:20:14,827 --> 00:20:17,462
handwritten and in crayon
from the Human Cannon,

414
00:20:17,513 --> 00:20:19,664
saying how much it misses you.

415
00:20:19,715 --> 00:20:21,183
Coach, that cannon is going
to get Brittany killed.

416
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:22,434
Is that really worth it

417
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:24,803
just to win a stupid
national champiohip?

418
00:20:24,854 --> 00:20:28,173
Seventh consecutive stupid
national championship.

419
00:20:28,224 --> 00:20:30,659
This is ridiculous. You had
quite a year last year, Q.

420
00:20:30,726 --> 00:20:32,861
And as I recall, you
didn't have such a good time

421
00:20:32,945 --> 00:20:35,346
out of that Cheerios! uniform.

422
00:20:35,398 --> 00:20:37,399
Ladies, I am giving you
the chance, right now,

423
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:41,236
to choose once and for all
where your true loyalties lie.

424
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,821
Choose the Cheerios!,

425
00:20:42,872 --> 00:20:46,391
or choose the Glee Club.

426
00:20:57,203 --> 00:20:58,887
How the hell could you do this?

427
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:01,256
Oh, don't get all up in my face, Finn.

428
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,924
What were we supposed to do?

429
00:21:03,009 --> 00:21:04,476
Uh, quit Cheerios!

430
00:21:04,543 --> 00:21:06,311
Coach Sylvester is awful to you guys.

431
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:08,396
And don't forget who was there for you

432
00:21:08,481 --> 00:21:11,933
the last time she dumped you
on your ass- us, Glee Club.

433
00:21:12,018 --> 00:21:14,853
And you don't think that
I feel awful about that?

434
00:21:14,904 --> 00:21:16,554
You don't need to be
a Cheerio! to be cool.

435
00:21:16,606 --> 00:21:18,106
Oh, you are so naive.

436
00:21:18,191 --> 00:21:19,557
This whole school is about labels.

437
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:22,194
Wow. I never realized
you were sfreakin' weak.

438
00:21:22,245 --> 00:21:24,446
Oh. I... What did you say?

439
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,914
All the Cheerios! quit Glee
Club. So why are you yelling

440
00:21:25,998 --> 00:21:27,115
at my girlfriend about it?

441
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,116
I'm yelling at her because

442
00:21:28,201 --> 00:21:29,367
I'm the leader of this team.

443
00:21:29,418 --> 00:21:30,902
Well, maybe it's time
for a chge at the top.

444
00:21:30,953 --> 00:21:33,088
What's that supposed to mean?
This is kind of hot, actually.

445
00:21:33,172 --> 00:21:34,673
It means that maybe the reason

446
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,209
everyone hates us is because
we need some new leadership.

447
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,544
Face it, you've had your feet
in both worlds for a year,

448
00:21:39,595 --> 00:21:41,263
and never been able
to bring them together.

449
00:21:41,347 --> 00:21:42,547
Maybe someone else could.

450
00:21:42,598 --> 00:21:44,516
What, as in maybe you? As in yes.

451
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:45,884
Well, maybe we should
settle this right now.

452
00:21:45,935 --> 00:21:48,220
Bring it. Brung.

453
00:21:50,106 --> 00:21:51,556
Want some more of that? Huh? Yeah.

454
00:21:51,607 --> 00:21:53,058
You like that? Huh?
Really, guys? Really.

455
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:55,644
Hey, hey! How many fights do
I have to break up this week?

456
00:21:55,728 --> 00:21:57,779
Now calm down...

457
00:21:57,863 --> 00:21:59,231
and get back to Glee Club.

458
00:21:59,282 --> 00:22:01,032
Come on.

459
00:22:02,568 --> 00:22:04,703

Guys...

488
00:23:45,755 --> 00:23:47,022
Real good.

489
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,675
Awesome!

490
00:23:50,726 --> 00:23:52,344
Seriously.

491
00:23:52,395 --> 00:23:54,679
All you football players
nailing that Zombies classic

492
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:56,514
on the first time out.

493
00:23:56,565 --> 00:23:58,350
I am impressed.

494
00:24:09,195 --> 00:24:10,662
Appropriate outfits.

495
00:24:10,729 --> 00:24:11,996
They represent the death

496
00:24:12,064 --> 00:24:13,531
of your guyses' reign at this school.

497
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:16,401
How many times do we have to
put you puckheads in your place

498
00:24:16,452 --> 00:24:19,170
before you realize that
football rules this school?

499
00:24:19,238 --> 00:24:21,589
Maybe, but not after you
make dancing fools of yourself

500
00:24:21,674 --> 00:24:22,707
at that halftime show.

501
00:24:22,758 --> 00:24:24,092
You know it,

502
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,127
we know it, the whole school knows it.

503
00:24:26,212 --> 00:24:27,578
They'll think different
after they see it.

504
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,963
It's going to be awesome.

505
00:24:29,031 --> 00:24:30,682
Holy crap. They turned Karofsky gay.

506
00:24:32,251 --> 00:24:33,718
What are you moose knuckles
doing with those Slushees?

507
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:35,303
Ready for the fireworks?

508
00:24:35,388 --> 00:24:36,971
It's Independence Day.

509
00:24:38,274 --> 00:24:39,557
Oh, my eyes!

510
00:24:39,608 --> 00:24:40,925
It's burning!

511
00:24:40,976 --> 00:24:43,111
Just relax; it stops
after a couple hours

512
00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:45,596
No frickin' way I'm
letting that happen again.

513
00:24:45,648 --> 00:24:48,066
He's in the first stage
of loserdom: denial.

514
00:24:48,117 --> 00:24:50,235
No! I am not a loser.

515
00:24:50,286 --> 00:24:52,036
And I don't sing and dance.

516
00:24:52,104 --> 00:24:55,290
I walk tall d carra big stick.

517
00:24:55,374 --> 00:24:58,960
Dude, relax... this is gonna be fine.

518
00:24:59,044 --> 00:25:00,445
Yeah, of course it is.

519
00:25:00,496 --> 00:25:01,746
'Cause I'm quitting Glee Club.

520
00:25:01,797 --> 00:25:03,748
No, you're not. Fact is,

521
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:05,750
covered in ice and red dye number seven,

522
00:25:05,801 --> 00:25:07,385
you guys look more like a team

523
00:25:07,453 --> 00:25:08,720
than you ever have out on the field.

524
00:25:08,787 --> 00:25:09,921
I don't care. I'm out.

525
00:25:09,972 --> 00:25:11,256
Then you're off the team.

526
00:25:11,307 --> 00:25:13,391
No way. Yeah.

527
00:25:13,459 --> 00:25:16,311
If we all quit, you barely have
enough guys to play next week.

528
00:25:16,395 --> 00:25:18,012
It's the championship game.

529
00:25:18,097 --> 00:25:19,130
You're not going to throw it away.

530
00:25:19,181 --> 00:25:21,683
Try me. FINN: Don't do this.

531
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:23,318
If we stand together,

532
00:25:23,402 --> 00:25:25,186
and we do the halftime
show, we can win this game

533
00:25:25,271 --> 00:25:26,271
and be kings in this place.

534
00:25:29,808 --> 00:25:32,160
Good luck with that.

Medium drip. BLAINE:
Me. Thank you very much.

607
00:28:22,696 --> 00:28:24,196
Now, I don't want to
sound cocky or anything,

608
00:28:24,248 --> 00:28:26,699
but you guys better be pulling
out all the stops for Regionals,

609
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,219
because the number we just
rehearsed is so off-the-hook,

610
00:28:29,303 --> 00:28:30,386
it's dangerous.

611
00:28:30,471 --> 00:28:31,754
Seriously. People should wear

612
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:32,839
protective headgear
when they're watching it.

613
00:28:34,508 --> 00:28:35,625
Guys, we're kidding.

614
00:28:35,693 --> 00:28:37,260
Yeah, well, it's just
hard to laugh right now

615
00:28:37,344 --> 00:28:38,428
with everything going on at McKinley.

616
00:28:38,512 --> 00:28:39,746
I mean, look at us,

617
00:28:39,813 --> 00:28:41,213
the stars of two rival show choirs

618
00:28:41,265 --> 00:28:43,433
sitting down to coffee-
our school is so messed up,

619
00:28:43,517 --> 00:28:45,068
we can't even keep our
own football team together.

620
00:28:45,152 --> 00:28:46,436
It's so sad, you guys.

621
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,820
Coach Beiste and Mr. Shue were so close

622
00:28:47,888 --> 00:28:49,388
to getting everyone
at the school together.

623
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,057
Why hasn't Finn told
me anything about this?

624
00:28:51,108 --> 00:28:52,408
I mean, we live together.

625
00:28:52,476 --> 00:28:54,444
mean, I bring him a glass
of warm milk every night,

626
00:28:54,528 --> 00:28:55,828
just in the hopes that we'll
have a little lady-chat.

627
00:28:55,896 --> 00:28:57,080
Warm milk? Really?

628
00:28:57,164 --> 00:28:58,164
It's delicious.

629
00:28:58,231 --> 00:28:59,899
Finn's too proud to complain.

630
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:01,734
He feels like he has to
be strong for everyone,

631
00:29:01,785 --> 00:29:03,336
but I know it's just killing him inside.

632
00:29:03,403 --> 00:29:04,587
I hope he realizes

633
00:29:04,672 --> 00:29:06,339
that, you know, if he
and I were still together,

634
00:29:06,406 --> 00:29:07,840
I could make him feel
a lot better, you know.

635
00:29:07,908 --> 00:29:09,208
Let it go, Rachel.

636
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,094
I...

637
00:29:11,178 --> 00:29:13,930
I just wish thathere was
a way that we could help.

638
00:29:13,998 --> 00:29:15,298
That's all. Yeah.

639
00:29:15,382 --> 00:29:16,349
And the worst part is
how bummed the guys are.

640
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,467
I mean, they already suffer

641
00:29:17,551 --> 00:29:19,469
enough abuse just being in Glee.

642
00:29:19,553 --> 00:29:21,087
I really think winning
the game could have eased

643
00:29:21,138 --> 00:29:22,639
some of the pressure, at
least for a little while.

644
00:29:22,706 --> 00:29:24,274
Wait, so the whole team quit?

645
00:29:24,358 --> 00:29:25,758
Everybody not in Glee.

646
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:27,259
I mean, you can't play
football with five guys.

647
00:29:27,311 --> 00:29:29,028
And one of them is in a wheelchair.

648
00:29:29,096 --> 00:29:30,262
Yeah, Coach Beiste
put up a sign-up sheet

649
00:29:30,314 --> 00:29:31,197
for people to join. I think they'll take

650
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,231
anyone at this point.

651
00:29:32,283 --> 00:29:33,533
Well, the good news is,

652
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,784
you actually only need four more guys.

653
00:29:34,868 --> 00:29:37,020
High school regulations actually let you

654
00:29:37,087 --> 00:29:39,405
play a couple guys
short, if you want to.

655
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:42,108
But if they figure out
a way to make it work,

656
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,409
you can bet that we'll
definitely be there

657
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,961
to cheer them on. Totally.

658
00:29:45,045 --> 00:29:47,130
Blaine and I love football.

659
00:29:47,214 --> 00:29:48,798
Well, Blaine loves
football. I love scarves.

660
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,454
I cut 30 guys when we had tryouts

661
00:29:55,506 --> 00:29:57,173
at the beginning of the season.

662
00:29:57,257 --> 00:29:59,892
You're telling me not one
of those guys wants to play?

663
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,728
It's like crossing a picket line.

664
00:30:01,795 --> 00:30:03,563
Nobody wants to be a scab.

665
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,765
I guess we should go break it to them.

666
00:30:05,816 --> 00:30:07,633
Why can't we just let them

667
00:30:07,685 --> 00:30:08,935
back on the team, just for this game?

668
00:30:08,986 --> 00:30:10,970
No. We carry this thing through,

669
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:13,239
even if it means having
to forfeit the game.

670
00:30:13,306 --> 00:30:14,357
I can't believe this is it.

671
00:30:19,813 --> 00:30:21,164
Maybe it isn't.

672
00:30:25,986 --> 00:30:27,420
We want to join the team.

673
00:30:27,487 --> 00:30:29,622
"We," who?

674
00:30:29,673 --> 00:30:31,007
All us Glee girls.

675
00:30:31,091 --> 00:30:33,843
We want to join the football team,

676
00:30:33,927 --> 00:30:35,545
and we want to play in the championship.

677
00:30:35,612 --> 00:30:36,662
Come on, guys. Stop screwing around.

678
00:30:36,714 --> 00:30:37,930
It's not cool.

679
00:30:37,998 --> 00:30:39,465
What's not cool is you guys

680
00:30:39,516 --> 00:30:40,833
not respecting women enough to realize

681
00:30:40,884 --> 00:30:42,685
we're perfectly capable
of playing football.

682
00:30:42,803 --> 00:30:43,970
And don't forget who the state champ

683
00:30:44,021 --> 00:30:45,171
in Greco-Roman wrestling is.

684
00:30:45,222 --> 00:30:47,640
I've got offers from three different

685
00:30:47,691 --> 00:30:48,941
professional wrestling organizations

686
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:50,943
for after I graduate, so...

687
00:30:51,011 --> 00:30:53,229
Rachel, have you actually
seen a tackle football game?

688
00:30:53,313 --> 00:30:55,031
When they tackle you, it hurts.

689
00:30:55,115 --> 00:30:56,649
Yeah. And not in the
good, Mellencamp way.

690
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,867
We thought about that. But the truth is,

691
00:30:57,951 --> 00:30:59,769
is that you guys don't
really need us to play.

692
00:30:59,837 --> 00:31:00,853
You just need enough players

693
00:31:00,904 --> 00:31:02,321
out there to field a regulation team.

694
00:31:02,373 --> 00:31:03,523
So when they snap the ball,

695
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,657
we're just going to
lie down on the ground.

696
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:05,691
We're just going to lie there.

697
00:31:05,743 --> 00:31:07,210
Well, I'm not.

698
00:31:07,294 --> 00:31:08,461
I'm going to bring the pain.

699
00:31:08,528 --> 00:31:11,831
I guess they won't get
hurt if you stay down.

700
00:31:11,882 --> 00:31:14,217
Okay, what do your
parents have to say about this?

701
00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:16,135
We all have signed
permission slips from them.

702
00:31:16,203 --> 00:31:18,421
It took some convincing,
but they understood

703
00:31:18,505 --> 00:31:19,806
what it means to all of us.

704
00:31:19,873 --> 00:31:22,341
What do you think, Coach?

705
00:31:22,393 --> 00:31:23,543
I think...

706
00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:27,880
Welcome to the football team.

707
00:31:27,931 --> 00:31:29,015
Yes!

708
00:31:30,734 --> 00:31:32,602
Football team, football team.

709
00:31:32,686 --> 00:31:33,853
High five, teammate.

710
00:31:33,904 --> 00:31:35,888
I just don't want to die.

711
00:31:35,939 --> 00:31:37,389
You don't climb in that cannon,

712
00:31:37,441 --> 00:31:40,276
and that routine will be all
"boom boom," and no "pow. "

713
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,747
And that, Brittany, is so 2000 and late.

714
00:31:44,832 --> 00:31:47,166
Here's your consent form.

715
00:31:47,234 --> 00:31:49,252
And as you ponder your decision,

716
00:31:49,336 --> 00:31:51,788
I ask that you remember that that cannon

717
00:31:51,872 --> 00:31:54,073
has two little baby
twin cannons at home,

718
00:31:54,124 --> 00:31:56,092
and one more on the way.

719
00:31:56,176 --> 00:31:58,911
And if you refuse to sign this,

720
00:31:58,962 --> 00:32:02,799
well, those little baby
cannons might just go hungry.

721
00:32:02,883 --> 00:32:05,551
Baby cannons?

722
00:32:05,602 --> 00:32:07,837
And the mama cannon has fibromyalgia,

723
00:32:07,905 --> 00:32:08,855
so she can't work.

724
00:32:11,024 --> 00:32:13,526
Do you want us to win, or don't you?

725
00:32:21,068 --> 00:32:22,685
How many M's are there
in the letter "R"?

726
00:32:22,753 --> 00:32:23,903
Make an "X."

727
00:32:37,245 --> 00:32:38,445
It's not too late.

728
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,698
To commit social suicide?

729
00:32:40,749 --> 00:32:42,783
How the hell you going to
play with five guys, huh?

730
00:32:48,707 --> 00:32:51,792
You have got to be kidding me.

731
00:32:51,877 --> 00:32:53,511
What the hell are they doing?

732
00:32:56,264 --> 00:32:58,549
What you don't have the balls to do.

733
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,886
Stupid.

734
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:13,430
Are you ready for this?

735
00:33:13,481 --> 00:33:14,615
Let's kick some ass!

736
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:22,406
Punch and Judy on one. Ready? Break!

737
00:33:22,457 --> 00:33:23,958
Break. MERCEDES: Who's Judy?

738
00:33:24,042 --> 00:33:24,875
Let's go!

739
00:33:25,877 --> 00:33:27,378
Where do I go?

740
00:33:27,445 --> 00:33:28,579
Stand right there.

741
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,580
What do I do?

742
00:33:36,588 --> 00:33:37,838
You're gonna die.

743
00:33:39,307 --> 00:33:40,224
Blue 42!

744
00:33:40,291 --> 00:33:42,476
Blue 42! Down!

745
00:33:42,561 --> 00:33:43,677
Set! Hike!

746
00:33:54,973 --> 00:33:56,273
Damn it.

747
00:34:02,581 --> 00:34:04,231
What happened? What
happened? Is it over?

748
00:34:09,871 --> 00:34:12,423
All right. How's everyone doing?

749
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:14,658
Kill me now, I'm gonna die.

750
00:34:14,709 --> 00:34:16,827
Is anyone else tired of
lying down all the time?

751
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:18,161
I want to play.

752
00:34:18,213 --> 00:34:19,930
Just don't get ahead of yourself, okay?

753
00:34:19,998 --> 00:34:21,966
Ready? Break.

754
00:34:22,017 --> 00:34:23,384
All right, guys. Let's go!

755
00:34:25,437 --> 00:34:26,937
Down!

756
00:34:27,005 --> 00:34:28,005
Blitz. Blitz. Watch.

757
00:34:28,056 --> 00:34:29,056
Set!

758
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,190
Hike!

759
00:34:34,613 --> 00:34:35,813
Get the ball!

760
00:34:38,066 --> 00:34:40,183
Get the ball! Get the ball!

761
00:34:40,235 --> 00:34:41,285
Come on! Get it! Get it!

762
00:34:43,354 --> 00:34:45,372
Go, go, go, go!

763
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,127
Go, go! Go! Go, go, go!

764
00:34:58,753 --> 00:34:59,720
Go!

765
00:34:59,804 --> 00:35:02,089
Tina?

766
00:35:02,173 --> 00:35:04,475
Oh, no.

767
00:35:08,647 --> 00:35:09,763
Is she breathing?

768
00:35:15,854 --> 00:35:17,621
Did we win?

769
00:35:31,402 --> 00:35:32,870
We're still in this.

770
00:35:32,921 --> 00:35:35,005
Give it up, Finn. Our
only shot at redemption

771
00:35:35,073 --> 00:35:36,757
right now is to kick
butt at the halftime show.

772
00:35:36,841 --> 00:35:38,876
Sam!

773
00:35:40,378 --> 00:35:41,912
Come here.

774
00:35:41,963 --> 00:35:43,931
I need you to play quarterback
for the rest of the half.

775
00:35:44,015 --> 00:35:45,132
Okay.

776
00:35:45,216 --> 00:35:46,684
Puck, when the half ends,

777
00:35:46,751 --> 00:35:48,085
you gotta go convince Karofsky
and the rest of the guys

778
00:35:48,153 --> 00:35:49,303
to do the halftime show with us.

779
00:35:49,387 --> 00:35:51,605
How the hell am I supposed to do that?

780
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:52,856
Figure it out.

781
00:35:52,924 --> 00:35:54,725
You're my wingman, right?

782
00:35:54,776 --> 00:35:56,694
I got tone, Mav.

783
00:35:56,761 --> 00:35:58,962
Where are you going?

784
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,564
Can't have a halftime
show without cheerleaders.

785
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:12,109
I'm gonna die.

786
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,211
It'll be worth it.

787
00:36:14,278 --> 00:36:15,996
Hey!

788
00:36:17,382 --> 00:36:18,882
What are you doing here?

789
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,367
Stopping you from going to
Sue's Regionals competition.

790
00:36:20,435 --> 00:36:22,169
You guys got to come
to the game with me.

791
00:36:22,253 --> 00:36:24,254
Haven't you been payingttention?

792
00:36:24,305 --> 00:36:26,123
If we're not Cheerios!, we're nothing.

793
00:36:26,174 --> 00:36:27,341
You think that, but it's not true.

794
00:36:27,425 --> 00:36:30,227
You joined Cheerios! to be popular,

795
00:36:30,294 --> 00:36:32,479
but you joined Glee Club
because you loved it.

796
00:36:32,564 --> 00:36:34,832
Sue doesn't care about you guys.

797
00:36:34,899 --> 00:36:36,400
She's fine killing Brittany.

798
00:36:36,467 --> 00:36:37,851
Tell me honestly.

799
00:36:37,936 --> 00:36:39,970
If you didn't think it
would hurt your reputation,

800
00:36:40,021 --> 00:36:41,138
which would you choose?

801
00:36:41,189 --> 00:36:42,523
Glee Club.

802
00:36:44,692 --> 00:36:46,744
I know you,

803
00:36:46,811 --> 00:36:48,695
and you don't think you are,

804
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,198
but you're strong enough to do this.

805
00:36:53,401 --> 00:36:55,318
Okay.

806
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,921
Okay?

807
00:36:57,989 --> 00:36:59,173
Okay.

808
00:36:59,257 --> 00:37:01,125
What about you, Santana?

809
00:37:01,176 --> 00:37:04,261
Screw her- she put me on
the bottom of the pyramid.

810
00:37:04,328 --> 00:37:05,462
Come on, we've oy got a few minutes.

811
00:37:05,513 --> 00:37:07,347
No time for a foursome, ladies.

812
00:37:07,432 --> 00:37:09,349
Bus leaves in five.

813
00:37:09,417 --> 00:37:11,718
We quit Cheerios!

814
00:37:11,803 --> 00:37:13,020
You can't quit Cheerios!

815
00:37:13,104 --> 00:37:14,721
It's blood in, blood out.

816
00:37:14,806 --> 00:37:17,024
Now get your sweet
little cans on that bus.

817
00:37:17,108 --> 00:37:18,859
We still quit.

818
00:37:18,943 --> 00:37:21,278
You're my stars.

819
00:37:21,345 --> 00:37:24,031
If you leave, I have no performance!

820
00:37:24,115 --> 00:37:25,983
Sucks for you.

821
00:37:35,326 --> 00:37:37,244
Looking good out there, Puck.

822
00:37:37,328 --> 00:37:39,163
You know what? I don't
want to hear it, Karofsky.

823
00:37:39,214 --> 00:37:40,964
I don't want to hear it from any of you.

824
00:37:41,032 --> 00:37:42,332
You're all a bunch of cowards.

825
00:37:42,383 --> 00:37:43,750
Coward losers.

826
00:37:43,835 --> 00:37:45,869
Yeah, you're the only
loser losing this game.

827
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,921
You know, this is it.

828
00:37:48,006 --> 00:37:50,057
This is the moment of our lives.

829
00:37:50,141 --> 00:37:52,375
This is the one we
can actually look back

830
00:37:52,427 --> 00:37:53,710
and tell our children about.

831
00:37:53,761 --> 00:37:56,546
This is our moment to
actually win something,

832
00:37:56,598 --> 00:37:58,899
and you guys are sitting
in the damn stands!

833
00:38:00,235 --> 00:38:01,768
I mean, you're so afraid

834
00:38:01,853 --> 00:38:03,520
of being called geeks or losers or gay,

835
00:38:03,571 --> 00:38:06,556
that you settle for being nothing.

836
00:38:07,826 --> 00:38:09,576
Well, we still have
a whole half to play.

837
00:38:09,661 --> 00:38:11,394
And wean win this, guys, I know it.

838
00:38:11,446 --> 00:38:12,646
What's the point, man?

839
00:38:12,714 --> 00:38:14,364
Beiste isn't going to let us play.

840
00:38:14,415 --> 00:38:19,569
She will if you come out and
perform at the halftime show.

841
00:38:19,621 --> 00:38:21,404
I'm in.

842
00:38:21,456 --> 00:38:23,340
Me, too.

843
00:38:23,407 --> 00:38:25,792
No way. Come on, man, I
really want to win this game.

844
00:38:25,877 --> 00:38:27,678
It would mean so much to my dad, man.

845
00:38:27,745 --> 00:38:29,680
Forget it, okay? Glee Club sucks.

846
00:38:29,747 --> 00:38:31,081
Fine, Karofsky's out. Whatever.

847
00:38:31,132 --> 00:38:33,050
But the rest of you need
to get in your zombie makeup

848
00:38:33,101 --> 00:38:34,935
and hit the field toot sweet.

849
00:38:35,019 --> 00:38:36,637
Come on, let's go!

850
00:38:36,721 --> 00:38:38,222

Hey! What are
you guys doing in here?

900
00:41:43,549 --> 00:41:45,166
Oh, we were gonna take
our zombie makeup off

901
00:41:45,217 --> 00:41:46,935
for the second half-
it's kind of itchy.

902
00:41:47,002 --> 00:41:48,553
No. Leave it on.

903
00:41:48,637 --> 00:41:50,521
Maybe we'll freak out the
other guys a little bit,

904
00:41:50,606 --> 00:41:53,024
and we need all the help
we can get right now.

905
00:41:53,108 --> 00:41:54,642
Well, get out there. All of us?

906
00:41:57,846 --> 00:41:59,513
Yeah. All of us.

907
00:42:04,019 --> 00:42:05,620
Yeah!

908
00:42:06,739 --> 00:42:08,189
Welcome back, boy.

909
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,458
Get out there.

910
00:42:23,872 --> 00:42:25,757
Yeah!

911
00:42:39,721 --> 00:42:41,222
Set! Hut-hut!

912
00:42:53,869 --> 00:42:55,119
Someone bit me!

913
00:42:55,204 --> 00:42:56,955
One of those zombies bit me!

914
00:42:58,257 --> 00:43:00,625
Good boy!

915
00:43:03,762 --> 00:43:05,964
Down! Set! One-one!

916
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:10,601
Block 59! Get on 59!

917
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,981
That was awesome. Nice block.

918
00:43:23,048 --> 00:43:25,066
Nice throw. Bam!

919
00:43:27,602 --> 00:43:28,369
Time out!

920
00:43:33,826 --> 00:43:34,942
It was a good run.

921
00:43:34,994 --> 00:43:36,160
We almost had it.

922
00:43:36,245 --> 00:43:37,962
Hey, this game isn't over.

923
00:43:38,047 --> 00:43:39,780
There's, like, ten
seconds left- it's over.

924
00:43:42,668 --> 00:43:45,169
Not if the quarterback fumbs the snap.

925
00:43:47,973 --> 00:43:50,124
Here's what we're gonna do.

926
00:43:50,175 --> 00:43:51,459

940
00:44:59,578 --> 00:45:03,131
So, tell me, Sue, how
are you holding up?

941
00:45:03,198 --> 00:45:05,133
I'm hanging in there, thank you.

942
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,835
I know it's painful, but...

943
00:45:07,903 --> 00:45:11,756
can you take me back to
the moment when you knew

944
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,707
you had lost what would have been

945
00:45:13,759 --> 00:45:16,978
a record seventh consecutive
national championship,

946
00:45:17,045 --> 00:45:20,714
landing you this interview
as "Loser of the Year"?

947
00:45:20,766 --> 00:45:22,617
I thought this was the
"Ten Most Fascinating. "

948
00:45:22,684 --> 00:45:24,018
That's Barbara Walters.

949
00:45:24,069 --> 00:45:27,321
In the voting, you beat
out the following losers:

950
00:45:27,389 --> 00:45:28,773
the economy,

951
00:45:28,857 --> 00:45:30,024
Mel Gibson,

952
00:45:30,092 --> 00:45:31,892
the housing market,

953
00:45:31,944 --> 00:45:33,945
Dina Lohan, Wall Street,

954
00:45:34,029 --> 00:45:36,998
Tiger Woods, the Dallas Cowboys,

955
00:45:37,065 --> 00:45:39,233
Brett Favre's cell phone,

956
00:45:39,284 --> 00:45:41,235
nine percent unemployment,

957
00:45:41,286 --> 00:45:42,870
and Sparky Lohan,

958
00:45:42,921 --> 00:45:47,175
who is Dina Lohan's dog and
apparently, also a loser.

959
00:45:47,242 --> 00:45:48,793
How do you cope with that?

960
00:45:48,877 --> 00:45:50,578
I've been drinking a lot of bleach.

961
00:45:50,629 --> 00:45:52,130
Do you regret the choice

962
00:45:52,214 --> 00:45:55,349
of attempting to fire a
student out of a cannon?

963
00:45:55,417 --> 00:45:58,453
Other than attracting headlines

964
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:01,939
and launching a national debate
on the safety of athletes,

965
00:46:02,024 --> 00:46:03,741
was it really worth it?

966
00:46:03,809 --> 00:46:07,261
Honestly, I was just
trying to feel something.

967
00:46:07,312 --> 00:46:09,697
And how do you feel
now that the remainder

968
00:46:09,764 --> 00:46:11,516
of the annual Cheerios! budget

969
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:13,985
is going to the Glee Club?

970
00:46:14,069 --> 00:46:15,903
I'm sorry? Let's take a look.

971
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,342
Whoops, sorry.

972
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:23,027
COURIC After
a little song and dance

973
00:46:23,095 --> 00:46:24,629
toupport the arts,

974
00:46:24,713 --> 00:46:26,780
I sat down with McKinley
Glee Club director

975
00:46:26,832 --> 00:46:27,965
Will Schuester.

976
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:29,467
I have to say, I'm thrilled.

977
00:46:29,551 --> 00:46:31,302
Sue got what was coming to her,

978
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:35,556
and now we don't have to hold a bake
sale to pay for the bus to Regionals.

979
00:46:37,459 --> 00:46:39,293
Thoughts?

980
00:46:41,613 --> 00:46:44,182
I hate you, Diane Sawyer.

981
00:46:46,351 --> 00:46:48,069
Hey. Hey.

982
00:46:48,136 --> 00:46:49,303
Congrats on the MVP.

983
00:46:49,354 --> 00:46:50,404
Oh, thanks.

984
00:46:50,472 --> 00:46:52,139
It was a team effort.

985
00:46:52,191 --> 00:46:54,158
So, listen, uh,

986
00:46:54,243 --> 00:46:56,777
there's no way the Glee Club's
gonna let you join permanently,

987
00:46:56,828 --> 00:46:58,613
until you clean things up with Kurt.

988
00:46:58,664 --> 00:47:02,983
So I was thinking maybe we cou go
together to Dalton and apologize...

989
00:47:03,035 --> 00:47:05,503
Who said I want to join
the Glee Club permanently?

990
00:47:05,587 --> 00:47:07,488
I just thought after
this week and-and...

991
00:47:07,539 --> 00:47:10,258
the way we won the game and the way you
came out to dance... What do you think?

992
00:47:10,325 --> 00:47:12,476
We all dance around together
and win a football game

993
00:47:12,544 --> 00:47:13,844
and everything's gonna change?

994
00:47:13,912 --> 00:47:17,215
Glee Club's gonna be cool
and we're all gonna sing

995
00:47:17,299 --> 00:47:18,716
hippie peace songs every morning?

996
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,635
Maybe. I-I don't know. It's a start.

997
00:47:20,686 --> 00:47:22,303
No, dude, it's a finish.

998
00:47:22,371 --> 00:47:24,071
Okay? This is high school.

999
00:47:24,139 --> 00:47:26,307
People's memories for good
stuff lasts about as long

1000
00:47:26,358 --> 00:47:29,443
as their Facebook status. But we've got
a chance to really change things here.

1001
00:47:29,511 --> 00:47:31,896
I just won the conference championship.

1002
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,731
I'm on top.

1003
00:47:33,815 --> 00:47:37,451
Why would I want to change things?

1004
00:47:42,324 --> 00:47:43,491
Hey.

1005
00:47:43,542 --> 00:47:44,909
Hi.

1006
00:47:44,993 --> 00:47:47,128
I never got a chance to thank you.

1007
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,864
For helping me do the right thing.

1008
00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:53,834
Aw, you would've come to
it on your own soon enough.

1009
00:47:53,885 --> 00:47:56,036
So, how does it feel being
out of the uniform? Weird.

1010
00:47:56,088 --> 00:47:58,806
Did turn a couple of heads.

1011
00:47:58,874 --> 00:48:00,874
You were amazing this week.

1012
00:48:02,327 --> 00:48:04,645
<i>On the field and off.</i>

1013
00:48:04,713 --> 00:48:07,148
Reminded me of why I loved you.

1014
