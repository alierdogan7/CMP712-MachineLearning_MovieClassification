1
00:00:00,297 --> 00:00:02,431
(door creaks)

2
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:04,399
Come on.

3
00:00:05,902 --> 00:00:07,907
ARTIE: So why are we in a barn

4
00:00:07,912 --> 00:00:09,577
in rural northeast Indiana?

5
00:00:09,603 --> 00:00:11,196
Well, gay marriage is illegal

6
00:00:11,222 --> 00:00:12,593
in Ohio, but legal in Indiana.

7
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:14,386
- Makes absolutely no sense.
- No, no.

8
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:16,754
<i>I mean, what are we doing in a barn</i>

9
00:00:16,788 --> 00:00:18,422
in rural northeast Indiana?

10
00:00:18,457 --> 00:00:20,860
I thought it would be fun
for you two to get married

11
00:00:20,886 --> 00:00:23,154
in the barn that Brittany was born in.

12
00:00:24,454 --> 00:00:26,063
What? Wait, what?

13
00:00:26,098 --> 00:00:27,524
Your father had his heart set

14
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,542
on this trip to the Amish country

15
00:00:29,568 --> 00:00:32,134
and we spent the whole day shopping for

16
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,914
handcrafted Amish electric fireplaces,

17
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,340
and I had this

18
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,137
horrible indigestion

19
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,964
from all that apple butter

20
00:00:40,434 --> 00:00:41,254
and I told

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,326
your father to pull the car over

22
00:00:43,352 --> 00:00:45,553
and I ran into this barn

23
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:46,779
for some privacy.

24
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:48,672
I quickly pulled down my pants

25
00:00:49,454 --> 00:00:50,693
and I squatted real low...

26
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:51,909
and usually, I never look...

27
00:00:51,945 --> 00:00:53,029
Oh, my God.

28
00:00:53,045 --> 00:00:55,738
But it was just my
lucky day. I looked down,

29
00:00:56,884 --> 00:00:57,801
and it turns out

30
00:00:57,835 --> 00:00:59,136
I was in labor

31
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,538
and Brittany, it was you.

32
00:01:01,985 --> 00:01:03,173
And I was very lucky,

33
00:01:03,207 --> 00:01:04,875
'cause there was a little cow over here

34
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:06,143
and he helped lick you clean,

35
00:01:06,177 --> 00:01:07,281
and I swaddled you

36
00:01:07,307 --> 00:01:08,851
in a Mr. Submarine wrapper

37
00:01:08,877 --> 00:01:10,177
that I found on the ground

38
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,938
and I carried you back to the car,

39
00:01:11,964 --> 00:01:14,325
and boy, was your father surprised.

40
00:01:14,351 --> 00:01:15,919
That story's insane.

41
00:01:15,953 --> 00:01:17,888
Listen, I'm so happy.

42
00:01:17,922 --> 00:01:18,880
That makes me very happy.

43
00:01:18,906 --> 00:01:20,106
I could not be happier.

44
00:01:20,132 --> 00:01:21,365
I've got my two moms

45
00:01:21,726 --> 00:01:24,327
and future BFFs together at last,

46
00:01:24,362 --> 00:01:26,563
and I think, babe...

47
00:01:26,597 --> 00:01:29,399
- What?
- this is the perfect place to get married.

48
00:01:30,346 --> 00:01:33,281
Well... it could be fun.

49
00:01:33,738 --> 00:01:36,206
- I can work with this.
- You better.

50
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,996
As your official wedding planner,

51
00:01:38,022 --> 00:01:39,456
I'll be there to make sure it's perfect.

52
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,125
And while this isn't

53
00:01:41,151 --> 00:01:42,976
exactly what I was picturing, either,

54
00:01:43,008 --> 00:01:44,080
- Mrs. Lopez,
- Mm.

55
00:01:44,115 --> 00:01:45,523
I do think this place

56
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:47,550
- has some potential.
- Mm-hmm.

57
00:01:47,952 --> 00:01:49,953
♪ ♪

58
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:55,350
Ooh, it's looking good, guys.

59
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:56,381
Hey, when you're done with that,

60
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:57,807
we need to give Tina a hand.

61
00:01:57,827 --> 00:01:59,828
How did I end up doing this?

62
00:01:59,863 --> 00:02:02,698
These are, like, 700-pound hay bales.

63
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:04,366
Because you volunteered to help out.

64
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:06,136
I didn't think I'd be stuck

65
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,504
doing heavy manual labor,

66
00:02:07,538 --> 00:02:09,387
or I wouldn't have worn heels.

67
00:02:09,413 --> 00:02:10,373
And I don't...

68
00:02:10,408 --> 00:02:11,808
I don't really know all these new kids

69
00:02:11,843 --> 00:02:13,176
and I think they're a little pissed

70
00:02:13,211 --> 00:02:14,444
that I didn't re-introduce myself

71
00:02:14,478 --> 00:02:15,737
and now nobody's talking to me

72
00:02:15,763 --> 00:02:18,031
- and it's really awkward.
- Oh, no. What's wrong?

73
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:21,151
I'm freaking out! I-I-I'm,
like, in total panic mode.

74
00:02:21,185 --> 00:02:22,652
I don't think this barn
is structurally sound

75
00:02:22,687 --> 00:02:23,887
and I'm scared it's gonna collapse

76
00:02:23,921 --> 00:02:25,082
and just, like... I'm
gonna kill everybody.

77
00:02:25,108 --> 00:02:26,371
Britt, you are just having

78
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:27,566
some pre-wedding jitters...

79
00:02:27,592 --> 00:02:28,825
- No.
- It's totally fine.

80
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,293
I'm like, we still,
uh, we still haven't had

81
00:02:30,328 --> 00:02:32,229
our final fittings... Oh, Kurt.

82
00:02:32,263 --> 00:02:34,364
I just got a telegram
from Martina Navratilova

83
00:02:34,398 --> 00:02:36,366
that she can't be our officiant
because she's never really

84
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,380
done it before and she doesn't
really know either of us.

85
00:02:38,406 --> 00:02:40,231
- Okay...
- Oh, my God. That's wrong.

86
00:02:40,257 --> 00:02:41,578
Can we-we just, like, throw it up?

87
00:02:41,606 --> 00:02:43,306
Like, way up high?

88
00:02:43,341 --> 00:02:45,757
- And these are in the wrong spot.
- TINA: Well, you...

89
00:02:45,783 --> 00:02:47,927
- you just said to put them here.
- Okay, well, you're wrong.

90
00:02:47,953 --> 00:02:49,412
I didn't... that... I'm sorry.

91
00:02:49,447 --> 00:02:51,414
You know, I-I'm here to help, okay?

92
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:53,083
And Britt, you have got
to trust me when I say

93
00:02:53,117 --> 00:02:55,018
that everything is gonna be fine.

94
00:02:55,052 --> 00:02:58,121
I-It's okay to have a-a little
anxiety before your wedding.

95
00:02:58,147 --> 00:02:59,314
There's dirt on the white thing.

96
00:03:00,758 --> 00:03:03,136
How did you cope with,
like, wedding planning?

97
00:03:03,714 --> 00:03:04,728
Well, I-I didn't really have to,

98
00:03:04,762 --> 00:03:07,330
because we called it off b-before...

99
00:03:07,365 --> 00:03:07,968
You remember?

100
00:03:07,993 --> 00:03:09,993
I find it really hard to
track your relationship.

101
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:12,169
Well, this isn't about me.

102
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,004
Um... so let's just focus

103
00:03:14,038 --> 00:03:15,405
on the problems at hand, okay?

104
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,262
Like the problem of your boyfriend

105
00:03:18,288 --> 00:03:19,406
being older than your dad?

106
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:21,077
Wait.

107
00:03:21,112 --> 00:03:22,345
I know who can officiate.

108
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,988
- Who?
- Burt!

109
00:03:24,014 --> 00:03:25,699
- Who's...?
- Burt Hummel.

110
00:03:25,725 --> 00:03:27,441
I-I don't... I don't know who that is.

111
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:28,994
It's-it's my dad.

112
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,287
SAM: It's his dad.

113
00:03:32,657 --> 00:03:33,957
Your... Yes.

Listen up, bitches. Here is the game plan.

116
00:03:38,963 --> 00:03:40,597
Britt and I do not want to see each other

117
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:41,965
in our dresses till the wedding.

118
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:43,456
So we're gonna come out one at a time

119
00:03:43,482 --> 00:03:44,542
and show you our selections.

120
00:03:44,568 --> 00:03:46,369
- Okay?
- BRITTANY: And no peeking, Santana,

121
00:03:46,404 --> 00:03:47,938
'cause I don't want
9,000 years of bad luck.

Brittany, that's it.

148
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,037
That is absolutely stunning.

149
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,841
I think this is the one, you guys.

150
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,275
RACHEL: I think so, too.

151
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,844
It looks so comfy, you could dance in it.

152
00:04:58,878 --> 00:05:00,178
- It's beautiful.
- I know, right?

153
00:05:00,213 --> 00:05:01,513
- (exhales)
- SANTANA: Wow.

154
00:05:01,547 --> 00:05:03,215
Wow, Brittany, You look so beautiful.

155
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:04,883
Oh, my God, what are you doing?

156
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:06,318
I was going crazy back there, but

157
00:05:06,344 --> 00:05:07,639
you know what? Everybody's right.

158
00:05:07,665 --> 00:05:09,545
- You look incredible.
- No, no, no. You're not supposed

159
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:10,459
to see the dress before the wedding.

160
00:05:10,485 --> 00:05:12,946
Oh, my gosh, this is bad
luck, Santana! Bad luck!

161
00:05:12,972 --> 00:05:14,973
It's okay, Britt. Calm
down. It's gonna be okay.

162
00:05:15,008 --> 00:05:16,375
Here. Throw some salt over your shoulder.

163
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:17,776
Go back inside. Go change.

164
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,645
- Okay. Go, go, go!
- What am I gonna do?

165
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:20,879
What's happening? What do I do?

166
00:05:21,609 --> 00:05:22,314
Hey, guys, do you mind

167
00:05:22,348 --> 00:05:23,548
if I ritualistically
slaughter this chicken?

168
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,147
I want to counteract the bad luck

169
00:05:25,173 --> 00:05:26,651
of Santana seeing me in my wedding dress.

170
00:05:26,677 --> 00:05:27,403
Oh, my God, you are not

171
00:05:27,429 --> 00:05:28,958
slaughtering that chicken in here!

172
00:05:28,982 --> 00:05:30,637
- I know, but it'll help.
- No. No.

173
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,631
- Take the chicken out.
- (sighs)

174
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,299
This is your lucky day, sir.

175
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,600
Just, please stop.

176
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,694
<i>SANTANA: Listen, if you
want to distract your mind,</i>

177
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,674
why don't you use your math brain

178
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,242
to help us figure out the seating chart?

179
00:05:45,072 --> 00:05:45,644
Good idea.

180
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,588
Okay, um...

181
00:05:46,802 --> 00:05:48,136
Well, I still think we should seat people

182
00:05:48,162 --> 00:05:49,401
based on the Dewey Decimal System.

183
00:05:49,427 --> 00:05:51,861
So, like, uh... Kurt
should sit with Rachel,

184
00:05:51,887 --> 00:05:53,326
because they're both a little annoying.

185
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,654
- No offense.
- Why aren't

186
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,686
Sam and Rachel seated next to each other?

187
00:05:57,712 --> 00:05:58,924
Carol and Burt are gonna be there

188
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,003
and I don't want to upset them.

189
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:01,826
Everybody is fine with you being with Sam.

190
00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:03,328
They're gonna be fine, too.

191
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,963
I just haven't talked to Carol in a while.

192
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:05,968
I did a lot, at first,

193
00:06:05,994 --> 00:06:07,609
and then I just got really
busy with the glee club

194
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:08,828
and I don't want to upset her.

195
00:06:08,854 --> 00:06:10,696
MERCEDES: Look, Carol
and Burt both lost people

196
00:06:10,722 --> 00:06:11,757
that they were in love with,

197
00:06:11,783 --> 00:06:13,150
and then they found one another

198
00:06:13,695 --> 00:06:15,296
and they started over again.

199
00:06:15,323 --> 00:06:17,400
They're gonna expect
you to do the same thing.

200
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:22,596
Okay.

201
00:06:23,965 --> 00:06:26,333
And there you go.

202
00:06:26,368 --> 00:06:28,268
Wait. Okay, hold up.

203
00:06:28,303 --> 00:06:31,004
<i>No me gusta. Why is Sue on the list?</i>

204
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,439
RACHEL: Oh, we should
just find her a table.

205
00:06:32,474 --> 00:06:33,640
She could sit with Becky Jackson.

206
00:06:33,675 --> 00:06:35,943
No. No, she is not invited to my wedding.

207
00:06:35,977 --> 00:06:38,345
Look, Sue has just been such
a big part of our lives, right?

208
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,647
I mean, we only met because
she put us in the Cheerios!

209
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:41,867
MERCEDES: All I have to say

210
00:06:41,893 --> 00:06:43,560
is if you invite the woman to the wedding,

211
00:06:43,586 --> 00:06:45,527
there is an 80% chance
that she's gonna ruin it.

212
00:06:45,553 --> 00:06:46,954
But if you don't,

213
00:06:46,988 --> 00:06:48,655
there's a 99% chance that she will.

214
00:06:49,135 --> 00:06:50,157
Praise. Well, listen,

215
00:06:50,191 --> 00:06:52,493
all I'm saying is no. Hell, no.

216
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:53,794
If she's there, then I'm not.

217
00:06:57,032 --> 00:06:59,033
(sighs)

218
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:02,269
So, I figured we could get

219
00:07:02,303 --> 00:07:03,971
fitted for suits at this place I know.

220
00:07:04,837 --> 00:07:05,806
Um...

221
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,212
actually, I... I had something else

222
00:07:07,238 --> 00:07:09,236
I wanted to talk to you about.

223
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:10,888
Um...

224
00:07:11,354 --> 00:07:12,922
I'm going to the wedding

225
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,654
with Blaine.

226
00:07:14,989 --> 00:07:16,450
Ah.

227
00:07:16,484 --> 00:07:17,518
I see.

228
00:07:18,386 --> 00:07:19,720
I'm so sorry.

229
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:21,355
I-I never expected this to happen.

230
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,702
It's called "young love," Kurt.

231
00:07:24,728 --> 00:07:25,601
It gets bruised

232
00:07:25,627 --> 00:07:27,228
and then it gets back up again.

233
00:07:28,057 --> 00:07:29,229
It's a nice thing.

234
00:07:31,433 --> 00:07:34,735
So... you aren't mad?

235
00:07:35,174 --> 00:07:36,470
Mad?

236
00:07:36,504 --> 00:07:37,805
No.

237
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,840
Jealous? Well...

238
00:07:41,743 --> 00:07:43,982
I mean, you're right at
the beginning of it all.

239
00:07:44,746 --> 00:07:46,216
I look at you, and...

240
00:07:47,107 --> 00:07:49,083
I think of the lifetime of love

241
00:07:49,117 --> 00:07:51,151
I could've had if I hadn't wasted it

242
00:07:51,186 --> 00:07:53,087
pretending to be someone I'm not.

243
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,224
You're lucky, Kurt.

244
00:07:57,258 --> 00:07:59,168
Go be lucky.

245
00:07:59,985 --> 00:08:01,562
<i>And whatever happens,</i>

246
00:08:01,596 --> 00:08:04,198
<i>even if you get hurt again, just remember:</i>

247
00:08:04,232 --> 00:08:06,100
the only thing worth doing

248
00:08:06,134 --> 00:08:07,534
is going toward love.

249
00:08:07,805 --> 00:08:09,603
Don't waste time double-guessing.

250
00:08:09,637 --> 00:08:11,739
And don't waste time behaving yourself.

251
00:08:11,773 --> 00:08:14,041
<i>You gotta run, you gotta jump!</i>

252
00:08:14,075 --> 00:08:16,110
<i>'Cause it won't stick around forever.</i>

253
00:08:16,144 --> 00:08:18,012
You gotta grab it while
it's right in front of you.

254
00:08:18,547 --> 00:08:20,948
<i>Whatever you do...</i>

255
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,384
don't let go.

256
00:08:26,454 --> 00:08:28,889
(knocking at door)

257
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,594
- Kurt, are you okay?
- No.

258
00:08:33,628 --> 00:08:35,195
I'm not okay, okay?

259
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,430
I-I-I love you.

260
00:08:36,464 --> 00:08:37,698
I-I-I still love you,

261
00:08:37,732 --> 00:08:38,932
and I-I know everything was

262
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:40,768
completely messed up before,

263
00:08:40,802 --> 00:08:42,236
but everything's fine now. So will you...

264
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,771
will you, will you go
to the wedding with me?

265
00:08:43,805 --> 00:08:45,639
I-I mean, unless there's...

266
00:08:45,674 --> 00:08:46,774
there's somebody else.

267
00:08:46,808 --> 00:08:48,809
There's no one else.

268
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,151
Okay.

269
00:08:57,185 --> 00:08:58,986
So, I've gathered my best boys

270
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,727
to get your opinion on something.

271
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,557
I'm gonna ask Mike to marry me.

272
00:09:03,591 --> 00:09:06,217
- Chang?
- What you talking 'bout, Tina?

273
00:09:06,243 --> 00:09:09,096
I got the ring and everything.

274
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,665
Tina, I love you, but
this is kind of crazy.

275
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,268
Is it really so crazy
for a girl to ask a boy

276
00:09:14,302 --> 00:09:15,883
for their hand in marriage these days?

277
00:09:15,909 --> 00:09:17,171
When you're not even dating the boy?

278
00:09:17,205 --> 00:09:18,172
Yes. It is.

279
00:09:18,206 --> 00:09:19,473
I think it's romantic.

280
00:09:19,507 --> 00:09:20,724
Thank you, Blaine.

281
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,758
When I was with Mike,

282
00:09:21,784 --> 00:09:23,777
I was the happiest I've ever been.

283
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:26,113
Look, two of our friends
are getting married

284
00:09:26,147 --> 00:09:27,982
and we've had two other near-weddings.

285
00:09:28,016 --> 00:09:31,585
I let Mike get away and it was
the biggest mistake of my life.

286
00:09:31,619 --> 00:09:34,521
I can't afford to risk losing
him forever to some other girl.

287
00:09:34,556 --> 00:09:35,923
Grab the moment and run with it.

288
00:09:35,957 --> 00:09:37,257
ARTIE: I'm all for that,

289
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:38,826
but how often do you guys even talk?

290
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,494
We didn't much when I was here,

291
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:41,664
but once I got to college

292
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,330
- we started texting a lot.
- (phone buzzes)

293
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:45,299
I mean, he's texting me right now.

294
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,001
I can honestly say

295
00:09:47,035 --> 00:09:48,702
that Mike is my best friend again,

296
00:09:48,737 --> 00:09:50,688
and he knows me better than anyone else.

297
00:09:50,714 --> 00:09:52,139
I'd love nothing more than to see

298
00:09:52,173 --> 00:09:53,374
you and Mike together forever.

299
00:09:53,408 --> 00:09:55,643
He's awesome, you're awesome,

300
00:09:55,677 --> 00:09:57,329
and you'd be guaranteed
to have Asian kids,

301
00:09:57,355 --> 00:09:59,513
so they'd automatically be super smart.

302
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,815
I'm Team Chang-Chang all the way.

303
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:03,050
Thank you.

304
00:10:03,052 --> 00:10:04,204
What about you, Artie?

305
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,186
I can't do this unless you all agree.

306
00:10:09,424 --> 00:10:11,158
I have my concerns.

307
00:10:11,192 --> 00:10:14,328
Uh, but if this is what you really want,

308
00:10:14,362 --> 00:10:16,230
then of course I support you.

309
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:18,298
Thank you all so much.

310
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,633
Yay!

311
00:10:19,668 --> 00:10:20,701
Yay.

312
00:10:20,735 --> 00:10:21,969
- Thank you, thank you.
- It's wonderful!

313
00:10:22,003 --> 00:10:23,504
PUCK: Ch-Chang!

314
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:27,101
(school bell ringing)

315
00:10:28,804 --> 00:10:29,897
Heard you wanted to see me.

316
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,635
Make it quick. I'm busy.

317
00:10:32,168 --> 00:10:33,336
Oh, okay.

318
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,471
Um, well, I understand you
don't want me at your wedding

319
00:10:35,506 --> 00:10:37,507
and of course that is your prerogative,

320
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:40,476
but for the record, I
would just like to say

321
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,078
that I'm very hurt by that.

322
00:10:42,112 --> 00:10:44,447
And I fully realize that, over the years,

323
00:10:44,482 --> 00:10:47,350
uh, you and I have had a
few minor... differences.

324
00:10:47,384 --> 00:10:48,536
But weddings are the time

325
00:10:48,562 --> 00:10:50,587
to put all those differences aside.

326
00:10:50,612 --> 00:10:53,169
That's a steaming load of
crap. I want to be surrounded

327
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:55,433
by the people who love me
and the people that I love.

328
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:57,827
The only person that you
know how to love is yourself.

329
00:10:57,862 --> 00:10:59,496
You don't know the first thing about me.

330
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,497
(scoffs)

331
00:11:00,531 --> 00:11:02,332
Yeah, actually I do.

332
00:11:02,366 --> 00:11:04,334
I know how selfish and
self-centered you are.

333
00:11:04,368 --> 00:11:06,769
Like the time that you wore an exact copy

334
00:11:06,804 --> 00:11:09,172
of Emma Pillsbury's
dress to her own wedding.

335
00:11:09,206 --> 00:11:11,608
And how you perverted
the very idea of marriage

336
00:11:11,642 --> 00:11:12,775
by marrying yourself.

337
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,645
You are incapable of a selfless act.

338
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,906
And if you do what you
always do and just show up,

339
00:11:17,932 --> 00:11:20,216
you will be forcibly removed
by the security guards

340
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:21,335
that I have hired.

341
00:11:22,234 --> 00:11:24,687
So have fun polishing your trophies, Sue.

342
00:11:24,722 --> 00:11:25,989
Bye.

343
00:11:34,897 --> 00:11:35,965
He's fragile, be careful.

344
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,400
I can't get mud on the wheels.

345
00:11:40,404 --> 00:11:42,005
Hi.

346
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,640
- You must be Carol?
- I am.

347
00:11:43,674 --> 00:11:44,841
Hi, I'm Blaine's mom.

348
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,843
Oh, my goodness, so nice to meet you.

349
00:11:46,877 --> 00:11:48,678
BLAINE'S MOM: It's so
nice to meet you, too.

350
00:11:48,712 --> 00:11:50,680
Hey.

351
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,682
You're blocking my face.

352
00:11:52,716 --> 00:11:54,317
Stop blocking everybody.

353
00:11:54,351 --> 00:11:55,318
Smile.

354
00:11:55,352 --> 00:11:56,352
MERCEDES: Sam.

355
00:11:57,755 --> 00:12:00,323
- Are you smiling? You smiling?
- No. No.

356
00:12:00,357 --> 00:12:01,724
Okay.

357
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:02,926
Um...

358
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,927
(camera clicks)

359
00:12:03,961 --> 00:12:05,228
- Did you take it?
- Mm-hmm.

360
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,030
I mean, everyone said it would be hard,

361
00:12:07,064 --> 00:12:08,698
but I'm telling you, man, the air force,

362
00:12:08,732 --> 00:12:09,699
it's a breeze.

363
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:10,867
Wow, Tina.

364
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:12,001
You look super-hot.

365
00:12:12,036 --> 00:12:13,403
Doesn't she, Mike?

366
00:12:13,437 --> 00:12:14,437
She always looks hot.

367
00:12:14,472 --> 00:12:15,281
(chuckles)

368
00:12:15,307 --> 00:12:16,940
Well, I'll, uh, leave you two.

369
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:20,210
Oh, your tie's a little crooked.

370
00:12:20,244 --> 00:12:22,078
Just straighten that out a little bit.

371
00:12:23,758 --> 00:12:24,514
Hey, guys.

372
00:12:24,914 --> 00:12:25,748
Hey, what's up, guys?

373
00:12:25,783 --> 00:12:27,016
- Just going over my notes
- (gasps)

374
00:12:27,051 --> 00:12:28,518
before my officiating.

375
00:12:28,552 --> 00:12:30,286
Oh, you both look so
handsome in your suits.

376
00:12:30,321 --> 00:12:31,855
- BURT: Yes, you do.
- Seems like only yesterday

377
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:33,256
we were getting ready
for your guys's wedding.

378
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,525
- That was the most beautiful day.
- Best day of my life.

379
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:37,527
- Aw...
- BLAINE: It's crazy to think

380
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:39,742
- that we almost followed right in your footsteps.
- KURT: Well, almost,

381
00:12:39,768 --> 00:12:42,031
and that would have been
a beautiful day, too,

382
00:12:42,066 --> 00:12:44,033
but, you know, it just...
it wasn't meant to be.

383
00:12:44,068 --> 00:12:45,126
Young and foolish.

384
00:12:45,152 --> 00:12:46,986
Hey, maybe you two guys
weren't meant to be,

385
00:12:47,012 --> 00:12:49,748
but, it's, like...
young, foolish? Come on.

386
00:12:49,774 --> 00:12:52,965
Are any of us ever
really ready for anything?

387
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,778
No, I wasn't ready to lose your mom.

388
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:57,881
And because of that we haven't
wasted one day since we met.

389
00:12:57,915 --> 00:12:59,816
That's right... it's been
a crazy adventure ever since.

390
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,651
Uh-huh, it has. You're
gonna make mistakes,

391
00:13:01,685 --> 00:13:03,953
and that's okay... I have made so many.

392
00:13:03,988 --> 00:13:05,555
- Are you saying I'm one?
- You are not one of them.

393
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:06,890
- You are one of the good things.
- Thank you.

394
00:13:06,924 --> 00:13:08,040
CAROLE: But you just have to take

395
00:13:08,066 --> 00:13:09,540
every second of every day

396
00:13:09,566 --> 00:13:10,933
and squeeze it as tight as you can.

397
00:13:11,428 --> 00:13:13,629
Just wring every last bit out of it.

398
00:13:13,764 --> 00:13:15,231
- Finn taught me that.
- Yep.

399
00:13:15,266 --> 00:13:16,633
Finn taught me that,
cancer taught me that,

400
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:19,428
seeing you in that
hospital bed taught me that.

401
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:21,404
Man, officiating a wedding

402
00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:23,173
- really puts you in a mood.
- Yeah, it does.

403
00:13:23,207 --> 00:13:25,408
- You just start thinking, and philosophizing...
- Get serious.

404
00:13:25,443 --> 00:13:27,510
- And-and "speechifying"... Excuse me.
- CAROLE: So go and, you know what?

405
00:13:27,545 --> 00:13:29,145
- We're gonna get you a beverage.
- We'll let you guys... All right, get me...

406
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,447
- I'm not drunk.
- No, he's not.

407
00:13:30,481 --> 00:13:31,700
(sighs)

408
00:13:32,783 --> 00:13:34,818
Okay, Mercedes, I need
you to find a spider,

409
00:13:34,852 --> 00:13:36,194
'cause it's good luck to
put a spider on your dress.

410
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,845
Um, and Tina, I need to find
some wine glasses to smash

411
00:13:38,871 --> 00:13:40,172
like the Jews do, 'cause
they have the best of luck.

412
00:13:40,324 --> 00:13:41,593
Oh, and, um, Rachel, I need you to

413
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:43,586
find me a lizard to cross my path...

414
00:13:43,728 --> 00:13:45,303
Trust me, it's, like,
witch's lore, or something.

415
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:47,464
Go! I need all the good
luck I can get, okay?

416
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:49,032
I don't want to end up like Jack and Rose.

417
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:50,433
Where the hell am I gonna find a lizard?

418
00:13:50,468 --> 00:13:51,668
Go, go, go.

419
00:13:51,702 --> 00:13:53,903
(sighs) Good luck, good luck, good luck.

420
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:56,706
When I pictured my wedding day,

421
00:13:56,741 --> 00:13:59,142
I thought that I'd be the
most beautiful bride ever,

422
00:13:59,176 --> 00:14:00,643
but I was wrong.

423
00:14:00,678 --> 00:14:01,945
You are... you look amazing.

424
00:14:01,979 --> 00:14:03,373
Santana, what are you doing here?

425
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:05,067
This is, like, the ultimate bad luck.

426
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,576
God, a bride cannot see her
bride before the ceremony.

427
00:14:07,927 --> 00:14:09,953
Why are you trying to
sabotage this wedding?

428
00:14:09,987 --> 00:14:11,354
You know what?

429
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:12,789
This was all adorable,

430
00:14:12,823 --> 00:14:14,576
but now I'm putting my foot down.

431
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,893
Do you even know why a
groom couldn't see the bride

432
00:14:16,927 --> 00:14:17,961
before the wedding?

433
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,195
Cannibalism?

434
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:19,812
No.

435
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:22,499
Dates back to arranged marriages.

436
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:24,273
People thought that if the couple had time

437
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:25,902
to see each other before the wedding,

438
00:14:25,936 --> 00:14:27,337
they would change their minds

439
00:14:27,371 --> 00:14:28,847
and bail on actually getting married.

440
00:14:29,571 --> 00:14:30,907
That's not us, okay?

441
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:33,767
Because you love me, and I love you.

442
00:14:33,793 --> 00:14:36,262
And no silly superstitions
are gonna change that.

443
00:14:37,588 --> 00:14:38,988
Hey.

444
00:14:39,116 --> 00:14:41,165
I'm really sorry that I can't go an hour

445
00:14:41,191 --> 00:14:44,421
without seeing you, 'cause
I'll just miss you too much.

446
00:14:45,368 --> 00:14:46,698
And me and you?

447
00:14:47,142 --> 00:14:48,324
Rules don't apply to us.

448
00:14:48,618 --> 00:14:49,325
They never have.

449
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,212
We make our own luck,

450
00:14:50,238 --> 00:14:53,040
so I say that it's good luck

451
00:14:53,186 --> 00:14:55,521
to kiss the bride before the
wedding because then we can have

452
00:14:55,547 --> 00:14:57,942
that kiss that we can't have in
front of our friends and family

453
00:14:57,968 --> 00:14:59,202
'cause they'd be too jealous.

454
00:14:59,236 --> 00:15:00,236
(sighs)

455
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:06,309
- Come here.
- I agree.

456
00:15:14,285 --> 00:15:15,832
I love you so much.

457
00:15:16,787 --> 00:15:19,255
(sighs) But so does this
mean I don't have to wear

458
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,757
the blue underwear I borrowed from Tina?

459
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,726
Ew, no, Britt, no, you shouldn't do that.

460
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,594
- I just felt weird about it.
- Ew.

461
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,264
What the hell are you doing here?

462
00:15:30,571 --> 00:15:32,287
You know what, Britt? You
actually might be right.

463
00:15:32,313 --> 00:15:34,513
We might actually have
the worst luck of all time.

464
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:37,494
'Cause I can't marry you if I'm
in jail for killing this bitch.

465
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,288
Look, kid, I come bearing gifts.

466
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:41,032
There's nothing that you could
give me that I would want.

467
00:15:41,058 --> 00:15:43,834
I told you I don't want
you here today, so get out.

468
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,661
Well, when you see the gift I'm bearing,

469
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,329
you will change your tune.

470
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:55,467
Abuela?

471
00:15:56,668 --> 00:15:58,602
What are you doing here? What's going on?

472
00:15:58,628 --> 00:16:00,918
<i>Well, I stopped by your
abuela's house the other day,</i>

473
00:16:00,944 --> 00:16:04,110
and laid down a little reverse Sue-chology.

474
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,693
Mrs. Abuela, you don't know me,

475
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,516
but I coached Santana on the Cheerios!

476
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:14,077
and worked very hard to make
sure her high school years

477
00:16:14,103 --> 00:16:15,571
were a living hell.

478
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:18,360
For some reason, I'm not
invited to her wedding.

479
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,962
And I understand that you're not going

480
00:16:19,996 --> 00:16:21,597
because of your religious beliefs.

481
00:16:21,631 --> 00:16:22,998
So I thought... who better to enlist

482
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:24,800
to ruin her big day than you?

483
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:26,768
So what do you think about that whole...

484
00:16:26,803 --> 00:16:29,571
stoning them to death
thing that the Bible says?

485
00:16:31,007 --> 00:16:32,474
That's horrible.

486
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:34,376
What do you think about
having them jailed?

487
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,111
Like our good friends the Russians do.

488
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:38,680
- No!
- Okay, thinking of a more Westboro approach?

489
00:16:38,715 --> 00:16:40,515
Getting together a good
old-fashioned hate group

490
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,516
and picketing?

491
00:16:41,551 --> 00:16:42,884
(scoffs)

492
00:16:45,276 --> 00:16:46,955
I was wrong.

493
00:16:47,729 --> 00:16:49,533
I'm not saying I agree

494
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:51,526
with every decision you make.

495
00:16:51,995 --> 00:16:55,130
I still don't believe
it's right for two women

496
00:16:55,164 --> 00:16:57,866
to get married, but I do believe

497
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:02,170
that family is the most
important thing in the world.

498
00:17:03,373 --> 00:17:05,374
And I love you, Santana.

499
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:11,346
I don't want to be the person in
your life that causes you pain.

500
00:17:12,846 --> 00:17:15,717
And I don't want to miss the
day that I've been dreaming of

501
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:16,885
my whole life.

502
00:17:17,713 --> 00:17:19,988
Or the birth of your kids.

503
00:17:20,023 --> 00:17:21,623
Or any other important days.

504
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:28,297
I don't agree with everything
that you believe, either.

505
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,868
<i>I just want my abuela back.</i>

506
00:17:34,518 --> 00:17:36,104
I've missed you.

507
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:37,973
I've missed you, too.

508
00:17:41,596 --> 00:17:43,211
I always knew Sue was my good luck charm.

509
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,057
Can I hug?

510
00:17:55,091 --> 00:17:56,258
SANTANA: Come on.

511
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:57,693
- Aw...
- (laughs)

512
00:17:57,727 --> 00:17:58,694
I'm pushing it, aren't I?

513
00:17:58,728 --> 00:17:59,695
Okay, all right.

514
00:17:59,729 --> 00:18:00,829
SUE: Do your thing.

515
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:06,768
KURT: Oh, is this so lovely.

516
00:18:06,803 --> 00:18:08,403
BLAINE: I know, it's beautiful.

517
00:18:08,438 --> 00:18:10,606
Where did they find the money?

518
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,608
Klaine, will you come with me, please?

519
00:18:12,642 --> 00:18:14,610
We have a bit of a situation.

520
00:18:14,644 --> 00:18:16,158
Nice try, Sue, but we're not gonna fall

521
00:18:16,184 --> 00:18:17,785
for an elevator in a barn trick.

522
00:18:18,114 --> 00:18:20,082
Oh, no, Porcelain, don't
thank me for forcing you

523
00:18:20,116 --> 00:18:22,084
back into the arms of tiny Sal Mineo.

524
00:18:22,118 --> 00:18:25,087
Listen, I swear to you on
Will Schuester's future grave,

525
00:18:25,121 --> 00:18:28,123
this is a legitimate Brittan-emergency.

526
00:18:38,434 --> 00:18:40,502
What are those?

527
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:42,304
Uh, Brittany, wh-what's going on?

528
00:18:43,002 --> 00:18:45,140
Kurt, Blaine,

529
00:18:45,174 --> 00:18:47,309
the whole time I was planning
this high-end barn wedding,

530
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:49,144
all I could think about was you guys,

531
00:18:49,178 --> 00:18:50,779
and not because you remind me

532
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:52,581
<i>of the pig and the gay
rat from Charlotte's Web,</i>

533
00:18:52,615 --> 00:18:56,447
but because I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you guys, okay?

534
00:18:56,473 --> 00:18:58,787
I looked up to you as
a couple in high school.

535
00:18:58,821 --> 00:19:01,123
You showed me there was a
place for me and Santana, too.

536
00:19:01,157 --> 00:19:02,776
I mean, you taught me how to be brave.

537
00:19:02,802 --> 00:19:04,658
And when you guys called off your wedding,

538
00:19:04,684 --> 00:19:07,653
it just broke my heart.

539
00:19:07,745 --> 00:19:09,729
Because it felt like my dream had died,

540
00:19:09,755 --> 00:19:13,260
so I want my dream back.

541
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:18,373
Okay.

542
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,209
I still don't get what
you're talking about, though.

543
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,211
Yes, you do, just think about it.

544
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:23,946
What Brittany is saying, Blaine,

545
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,714
is that out of our love

546
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,116
for your love,

547
00:19:28,151 --> 00:19:30,719
we have conspired to
deceive and manipulate

548
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:33,188
and, yes, imprison you briefly

549
00:19:33,223 --> 00:19:35,524
all to reach this moment.

550
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:38,460
We have two tuxes,

551
00:19:38,495 --> 00:19:39,828
do we have two grooms?

552
00:19:42,732 --> 00:19:44,733
Okay, you guys are making funny
faces... what do you think?

553
00:19:47,675 --> 00:19:49,242
I think you're crazy.

554
00:19:49,268 --> 00:19:51,502
I-I... Blaine and I just got back together,

555
00:19:51,528 --> 00:19:53,028
and, uh, even if we hadn't,

556
00:19:53,054 --> 00:19:54,722
e-even if we were ready,

557
00:19:54,748 --> 00:19:57,955
I mean, Santana would never
let us crash her wedding.

558
00:19:57,981 --> 00:19:59,181
Oh, well,

559
00:19:59,749 --> 00:20:01,016
I would think again.

560
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:04,019
Turns out I am a lot like the Godfather

561
00:20:04,053 --> 00:20:05,220
on a wedding day.

562
00:20:05,255 --> 00:20:06,855
And as crazy as this all sounds,

563
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:09,359
I couldn't deny my bride her only wish.

564
00:20:09,385 --> 00:20:11,160
All you have to do is say yes.

565
00:20:11,194 --> 00:20:12,161
BRITTANY (whispering): Say yes.

566
00:20:12,195 --> 00:20:13,557
Say yes.

567
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,917
Well, we don't even have rings.

568
00:20:14,943 --> 00:20:16,844
Oh, I got that covered.

569
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:18,600
(Sue chuckles)

570
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:20,035
So what do you say, fellas?

571
00:20:20,069 --> 00:20:21,170
Will you give America

572
00:20:21,204 --> 00:20:23,772
what at least 52 percent of it

573
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:25,107
will legally tolerate?

574
00:20:28,211 --> 00:20:32,181
Uh, look, th-this is all very romantic,

575
00:20:32,215 --> 00:20:33,782
and-and-and sweet,

576
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,417
and-and-and a little weird,

577
00:20:35,452 --> 00:20:36,852
but, I mean, come on,

578
00:20:36,886 --> 00:20:39,855
Th-there is no possible way

579
00:20:39,889 --> 00:20:41,457
that-that...

580
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,692
(chuckles)

581
00:20:43,726 --> 00:20:44,893
Right?

582
00:20:46,701 --> 00:20:47,868
Blaine?

583
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:50,966
I don't know,

584
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,301
I-I don't know.

585
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:53,729
I...

586
00:20:54,572 --> 00:20:55,955
I just...

587
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,241
What Burt and Carole were
talking about earlier,

588
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:02,211
and these last few months without you

589
00:21:02,245 --> 00:21:03,512
have been really...

590
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,408
I love you, Kurt.

591
00:21:08,408 --> 00:21:09,619
I mean, I love you,

592
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:10,945
I-I do, I...

593
00:21:11,211 --> 00:21:12,799
This is crazy, this is crazy.

594
00:21:12,825 --> 00:21:13,760
And I don't... I don't know...

595
00:21:13,786 --> 00:21:15,377
I don't know, but...

596
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:20,276
But...

597
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,369

And he missed the whole aisle thing.

644
00:24:03,282 --> 00:24:04,282
Yeah.

645
00:24:14,028 --> 00:24:17,030
All right, don't say a word. I
am barely keeping it together.

646
00:24:17,376 --> 00:24:18,943
Uh, dearly beloved.

647
00:24:18,978 --> 00:24:19,805
That's how you're supposed

648
00:24:19,831 --> 00:24:21,264
to start these things, right?

649
00:24:21,714 --> 00:24:23,961
Uh, twice in my life

650
00:24:24,313 --> 00:24:26,539
I've been lucky enough to
meet the love of my life.

651
00:24:26,836 --> 00:24:27,886
And both of those times,

652
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,287
I've married that love.

653
00:24:29,953 --> 00:24:31,189
And I knew I was lucky

654
00:24:31,223 --> 00:24:32,490
to be able to do that.

655
00:24:32,525 --> 00:24:33,958
But I didn't know how lucky

656
00:24:34,531 --> 00:24:36,628
until I had to drive over the state line

657
00:24:36,662 --> 00:24:39,943
to come here to officiate the weddings

658
00:24:39,969 --> 00:24:41,699
of these two loving couples.

659
00:24:46,105 --> 00:24:47,138
And I thank you guys.

660
00:24:47,173 --> 00:24:49,073
Santana, Britt?

661
00:24:49,383 --> 00:24:51,242
Blaine, Kurt?

662
00:24:52,102 --> 00:24:54,412
I want to thank you
guys for being so brave.

663
00:24:54,438 --> 00:24:55,313
And so honest.

664
00:24:55,347 --> 00:24:56,681
And for standing up here

665
00:24:56,715 --> 00:24:58,583
and showing all of us

666
00:24:58,617 --> 00:25:02,615
that love and marriage is so much bigger

667
00:25:02,641 --> 00:25:04,094
than we thought it could be.

668
00:25:05,133 --> 00:25:06,875
And also so much simpler.

669
00:25:08,085 --> 00:25:11,729
Love and marriage is when
two people say to one another

670
00:25:11,764 --> 00:25:13,763
I love you because I love you.

671
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:16,576
And I know this is gonna
be one heck of a ride.

672
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:18,169
But I don't want to do it

673
00:25:18,508 --> 00:25:20,438
unless I can do it with you.

674
00:25:21,867 --> 00:25:24,709
And now, the vows, please.

675
00:25:24,743 --> 00:25:28,208
My husband's in the bathroom
and he's missing all the vows.

676
00:25:28,234 --> 00:25:29,203
KURT: Blaine?

677
00:25:29,578 --> 00:25:30,841
I'm a man who's always

678
00:25:30,867 --> 00:25:32,617
lived in the shadows.

679
00:25:32,651 --> 00:25:34,285
And everyone who's

680
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,520
come into my life has always tried

681
00:25:35,554 --> 00:25:36,721
to pull me out into the sun

682
00:25:36,755 --> 00:25:38,923
or push me back into the darkness.

683
00:25:38,958 --> 00:25:42,260
I've been bullied,
outed and misunderstood.

684
00:25:42,294 --> 00:25:44,896
I honestly thought that I
would never find real love.

685
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,865
The world seemed so scary and confusing.

686
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:48,933
It was just too fast.

687
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:50,635
It made me feel dumb just because

688
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:51,936
my brain worked differently

689
00:25:51,971 --> 00:25:54,072
And then you came along and even if

690
00:25:54,106 --> 00:25:57,297
someone had told me that
it wasn't gonna work out,

691
00:25:57,836 --> 00:25:59,410
and that at the end of
all of our struggling

692
00:25:59,445 --> 00:26:02,156
and all of our work, it
would just end in heartache...

693
00:26:02,617 --> 00:26:03,648
I would've said yes.

694
00:26:03,682 --> 00:26:05,049
A thousand times yes.

695
00:26:05,084 --> 00:26:06,451
I would've suffered it all

696
00:26:06,485 --> 00:26:07,785
just for the tiny chance to be

697
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,656
standing up here marrying you.

698
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,307
I'm a work in progress.

699
00:26:11,624 --> 00:26:13,158
I am a work in progress.

700
00:26:13,192 --> 00:26:14,459
I'm a work in progress.

701
00:26:14,493 --> 00:26:15,994
I'm a work in progress.

702
00:26:16,028 --> 00:26:16,995
KURT: You don't ask me

703
00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:18,496
to come out of the shadows.

704
00:26:18,531 --> 00:26:19,564
You help me move away anything

705
00:26:19,598 --> 00:26:21,299
that's blocking the sun.

706
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:25,103
It's time for all of us to
walk into the sunshine together.

707
00:26:25,414 --> 00:26:27,005
Forever.

708
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,506
Is that something you want to do?

709
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,808
I do.

710
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,809
I do.

711
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:31,743
I do.

712
00:26:31,777 --> 00:26:32,710
I do.

713
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:50,650
And now by the power
vested in me by the Internet

714
00:26:50,924 --> 00:26:52,163
and the state of Indiana

715
00:26:52,198 --> 00:26:54,165
and under a God who for sure

716
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,800
if he believes in love,

717
00:26:55,835 --> 00:26:58,288
then he fully endorses

718
00:26:58,314 --> 00:27:01,206
the loving marriages of
these two wonderful couples,

719
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,607
I now pronounce you

720
00:27:02,641 --> 00:27:04,309
wife and wife

721
00:27:04,674 --> 00:27:06,211
and husband and husband.

722
00:27:06,728 --> 00:27:08,767
You may kiss one another.

723
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,595
(all whooping and cheering)

724
00:27:45,604 --> 00:27:47,705
Hello. My name's Pierce Pierce.

725
00:27:47,738 --> 00:27:49,739
And I'm Brittany's father.

726
00:27:49,774 --> 00:27:52,142
And I was just told that I was expected

727
00:27:52,176 --> 00:27:54,041
to stand up and give a toaster.

728
00:27:54,067 --> 00:27:58,314
But, uh, I just called Target,
and they're closed, so...

729
00:27:58,349 --> 00:28:00,549
instead I'd just like to say a few words.

730
00:28:02,385 --> 00:28:03,720
Brittany?

731
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:05,288
I'm so happy

732
00:28:05,323 --> 00:28:08,758
that you and Santana
finally found one another.

733
00:28:08,963 --> 00:28:11,346
You look absolutely stunning in that gown.

734
00:28:11,697 --> 00:28:13,361
And, um, honestly?

735
00:28:13,736 --> 00:28:14,791
I can speak on behalf

736
00:28:14,817 --> 00:28:16,050
of my wife...

737
00:28:16,701 --> 00:28:18,501
you're the prettiest one here.

738
00:28:18,536 --> 00:28:20,994
And I don't just think
you're the prettiest.

739
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,821
I think you're the
prettiest by a long shot.

740
00:28:22,991 --> 00:28:25,726
I mean, if you look at
all the other girls here,

741
00:28:25,752 --> 00:28:27,053
there's really no contest.

742
00:28:27,627 --> 00:28:28,845
I mean,

743
00:28:28,879 --> 00:28:31,147
some of them are just downright homely.

744
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:33,249
You know what I'm talking about.

745
00:28:33,284 --> 00:28:34,584
You're-you're blowing it.

746
00:28:34,618 --> 00:28:36,283
And you need to sit down.

747
00:28:36,309 --> 00:28:38,869
'Cause nobody is uglier than
you without your clothes on.

748
00:28:38,895 --> 00:28:40,057
Knock it off.

749
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:43,205
I was just informed

750
00:28:43,231 --> 00:28:46,266
that no one's ugly and to knock it off!

751
00:28:47,174 --> 00:28:48,377
In closing,

752
00:28:48,403 --> 00:28:51,676
I just want everyone to be
really careful of the candles.

753
00:28:51,892 --> 00:28:54,760
Because with all that
dry wood and hay bales,

754
00:28:54,786 --> 00:28:56,548
this place could up like a blowtorch.

755
00:28:56,689 --> 00:28:58,861
And we'd all be dead in minutes.

756
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:02,045
- So... <i>salud.
- (whoops)</i>

757
00:29:07,571 --> 00:29:09,794
All right, everyone, so, uh, at this time,

758
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,580
we would normally be serving dinner.

759
00:29:11,606 --> 00:29:13,249
But, um, before we do that,

760
00:29:13,275 --> 00:29:15,943
we have a gift for each
and every one of you.

761
00:29:16,394 --> 00:29:18,721
So, in case you're
basic and you don't know,

762
00:29:18,747 --> 00:29:21,049
OTP stands for "One True Pairing."

763
00:29:21,075 --> 00:29:22,424
And I've been lucking enough

764
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,658
to find mine with Brittany.

765
00:29:24,684 --> 00:29:27,307
And Kurt and Blaine were
lucky to find each other.

766
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:30,311
And so in the spirit of
everyone here finding their OTP,

767
00:29:30,337 --> 00:29:32,538
please join us on the dance floor.

768
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:34,792

Hey, Tina.

Great day, huh? Oh, the best.

809
00:31:25,992 --> 00:31:28,765
Hey, promise me you won't leave
until we get at least one dance.

810
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:29,891
Oh, of course. Uh, Mike, wait!

811
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:30,788
Do you have a second?

812
00:31:30,814 --> 00:31:32,115
I-I need to ask you something.

813
00:31:32,579 --> 00:31:33,101
Yeah.

814
00:31:33,127 --> 00:31:34,038
Okay.

815
00:31:35,825 --> 00:31:37,025
(door closes)

816
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:41,898
Uh, Mike? (laughs)

817
00:31:42,773 --> 00:31:45,524
Not a day goes by that
I don't think about you.

818
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:48,160
And I thought being away
from you all these years

819
00:31:48,195 --> 00:31:50,867
would make me forget the love
that we had together, but...

820
00:31:51,598 --> 00:31:53,273
it's only made me love you more.

821
00:31:53,402 --> 00:31:56,371
I want to spend every day
of my life with you, and...

822
00:31:56,695 --> 00:31:59,989
well, I've forgotten half of
the things that I wanted to say,

823
00:32:00,015 --> 00:32:01,574
so, um...

824
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:05,035
Michael Robert Chang Jr.,

825
00:32:05,445 --> 00:32:06,859
will you marry me?

826
00:32:08,585 --> 00:32:10,182
I-I know you're probably
freaked out right now!

827
00:32:10,217 --> 00:32:11,929
I-I would be, too, and
obviously you don't have

828
00:32:11,955 --> 00:32:14,201
to give me an answer right
now, and-and we don't have

829
00:32:14,227 --> 00:32:16,931
to get married any time soon.
We can both finish college.

830
00:32:16,957 --> 00:32:18,406
And I just...

831
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:21,260
I just love you so much.

832
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:24,096
(short laugh)

833
00:32:24,499 --> 00:32:26,173
I love you, too.

834
00:32:27,062 --> 00:32:28,624
B-But, Tina...

835
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:30,867
I can't marry you.

836
00:32:31,327 --> 00:32:32,371
Oh, my God.

837
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:33,506
I...

838
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,874
This was so stupid.

839
00:32:34,908 --> 00:32:36,175
I'm so stupid.

840
00:32:36,209 --> 00:32:38,497
I mean, what kind of idiot does this?!

841
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:39,245
You.

842
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,780
But you're not an idiot.

843
00:32:42,218 --> 00:32:44,083
Look, I think about you all the time, too.

844
00:32:44,117 --> 00:32:46,352
And-and every time I do,

845
00:32:46,386 --> 00:32:47,617
I smile.

846
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,256
And it means the world to me

847
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:51,957
that we reconnected this past year.

848
00:32:52,452 --> 00:32:56,505
And I love how smart,
funny and sexy you are.

849
00:32:56,531 --> 00:32:57,196
(groans)

850
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:59,468
I... yeah.

851
00:32:59,494 --> 00:33:00,609
I said "sexy."

852
00:33:00,635 --> 00:33:02,781
And I've felt that way
ever since that summer

853
00:33:02,807 --> 00:33:04,335
we made out at Asian Camp.

854
00:33:07,171 --> 00:33:08,281
When four of our best friends

855
00:33:08,307 --> 00:33:10,317
get married on the same day,

856
00:33:10,343 --> 00:33:12,645
I-it's only natural
to want what they have.

857
00:33:13,101 --> 00:33:14,663
We have our whole lives ahead of us.

858
00:33:14,689 --> 00:33:16,687
And who knows where we'll be in a year?

859
00:33:17,784 --> 00:33:19,101
But there's a million guys out there

860
00:33:19,127 --> 00:33:20,460
- who would be so...
- Yeah, I know.

861
00:33:20,486 --> 00:33:21,843
I get it.

862
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,585
I would like to propose

863
00:33:33,753 --> 00:33:36,007
that we go in there and have our dance.

864
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,648
(exhales)

865
00:33:37,674 --> 00:33:39,041
(sniffs)

866
00:33:39,067 --> 00:33:41,769
Well, I accept your proposal.

867
00:33:45,212 --> 00:33:46,779
Well, I didn't really propose.

868
00:33:46,813 --> 00:33:48,280
- It was like, you just...
- Oh, stop it.

869
00:33:48,315 --> 00:33:49,815
Where'd you get that ring, by the way?

870
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,038
MRS. LOPEZ: Come on, come on, come on.

871
00:33:51,064 --> 00:33:52,865
This party's on fire!

872
00:33:52,891 --> 00:33:54,976
(guests cheering)

873
00:33:55,002 --> 00:33:57,304
And we whipped up a little number for you.

874
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,766
And we have some very special guests:

875
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,100

00:36:38,553 --> 00:36:41,055
On behalf of our inspirational brides,

937
00:36:41,081 --> 00:36:43,649
my husband and I... whoa,
that was weird to say.

938
00:36:43,685 --> 00:36:45,385
Uh, we would like to say thank you.

939
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,278
Thank you, thank you so
much to all of our family

940
00:36:47,304 --> 00:36:50,352
and to all of our friends
for showing us, by example,

941
00:36:50,378 --> 00:36:52,401
that real love is worth waiting for.

942
00:36:52,427 --> 00:36:53,926
And worth fighting for.

943

Oh... I thought we were
doing takeout on the risers.

980
00:39:25,538 --> 00:39:27,348
We could've gone to a real restaurant.

981
00:39:27,374 --> 00:39:28,726
I was feeling nostalgic.

982
00:39:29,124 --> 00:39:31,042
I wanted to relive our Tuesday lunches.

983
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:31,934
Hmm.

984
00:39:33,468 --> 00:39:34,565
How are you doing?

985
00:39:35,514 --> 00:39:36,667
Meh.

986
00:39:37,335 --> 00:39:38,915
I know you think I'm crazy

987
00:39:38,941 --> 00:39:40,452
for proposing to Mike.

988
00:39:40,483 --> 00:39:41,739
But it's... it's a little hard,

989
00:39:41,774 --> 00:39:43,808
seeing all these fun, exciting things

990
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:45,076
happening to your friends

991
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,996
and not getting a little jealous.

992
00:39:47,022 --> 00:39:47,707
I mean,

993
00:39:47,733 --> 00:39:48,608
look at Kurt and Blaine

994
00:39:48,634 --> 00:39:50,189
and how spontaneous they were

995
00:39:50,215 --> 00:39:52,356
and how everything just worked out.

996
00:39:52,866 --> 00:39:53,434
I wish,

997
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,043
just for once, that could be me.

998
00:39:55,069 --> 00:39:57,077
No one loves being alone.

999
00:39:57,155 --> 00:39:58,082
I know I don't.

1000
00:39:58,108 --> 00:39:59,791
But I also know you
can't just force yourself

1001
00:39:59,825 --> 00:40:01,025
to be in a relationship

1002
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,293
to avoid it.

1003
00:40:02,328 --> 00:40:03,761
I mean, that's how you miss out

1004
00:40:03,796 --> 00:40:06,155
on finding the perfect person for you.

1005
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:08,403
I mean, if you hadn't dumped me,

1006
00:40:08,429 --> 00:40:09,918
you never would've started dating Mike.

1007
00:40:09,944 --> 00:40:12,332
Um, excuse me, you broke up with me.

1008
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:12,837
No.

1009
00:40:12,871 --> 00:40:14,005
Because I had a fake stutter?

1010
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:16,007
Stop. That is not what happened at all.

1011
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:18,020
I never would've broken up with you.

1012
00:40:18,046 --> 00:40:19,460
- You're awesome.
- Ugh...

1013
00:40:19,608 --> 00:40:21,346
I'm sure I'll be fine
being alone forever...

1014
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,949
Tina, your problem

1015
00:40:22,975 --> 00:40:24,816
is that you always worry too much.

1016
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,845
You're not going to spend your life alone.

1017
00:40:26,871 --> 00:40:27,905
How can you be sure?

1018
00:40:28,991 --> 00:40:29,874
Mmm...

1019
00:40:31,086 --> 00:40:32,887
How about this?

1020
00:40:32,913 --> 00:40:34,492
Let's make a pact.

1021
00:40:35,179 --> 00:40:37,804
If we're both not married by 30,

1022
00:40:38,796 --> 00:40:40,014
we'll marry each other.

1023
00:40:40,561 --> 00:40:42,749
Oh, my God, Artie, yes! (laughing)

1024
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:44,869
We love each other, our sexual chemistry

1025
00:40:44,903 --> 00:40:47,496
- is undeniable...
- Uh-huh.

1026
00:40:47,522 --> 00:40:48,637
- Oh.
- See?

1027
00:40:48,772 --> 00:40:49,988
And our kids

1028
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,106
are pretty much guaranteed

1029
00:40:51,132 --> 00:40:52,116
to get into every preschool.

1030
00:40:52,142 --> 00:40:53,225
Okay.

1031
00:40:53,257 --> 00:40:55,425
I officially accept your invitation

1032
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,960
to be your backup fiancée.

1033
00:40:56,994 --> 00:40:58,395
- (laughs)
- How romantic.

1034
00:40:58,429 --> 00:40:59,663
(laughs)

1035
00:41:00,431 --> 00:41:00,931
I mean,

1036
00:41:00,965 --> 00:41:02,499
I think everyone needs

1037
00:41:02,533 --> 00:41:05,084
a little more Tartie in their lives.

1038
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:07,272
I think we're more Artina.

1039
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,271
Look at us.

1040
00:41:08,306 --> 00:41:10,311
Already putting the other person first.

1041
00:41:10,337 --> 00:41:12,334
That's a sign of a healthy relationship.

1042
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:14,123
Here's to always having somebody

1043
00:41:14,149 --> 00:41:15,584
amazing to roll with.

1044
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:17,514
And as we know, no one
rolls better than me.

1045
00:41:17,548 --> 00:41:18,782
(both laughing)

1046
00:41:18,816 --> 00:41:20,150
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1047
00:41:22,376 --> 00:41:23,798
Okay, Sue.

1048
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,021
We know you're in here.

1049
00:41:25,056 --> 00:41:26,517
You can come out now.

1050
00:41:27,825 --> 00:41:29,292
SUE: Well, well, well.

1051
00:41:29,327 --> 00:41:32,423
If it isn't my gender-gentle AnderHummels

1052
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:34,840
and the autistically feisty LoPierces.

1053
00:41:34,866 --> 00:41:35,704
(Sue chuckles)

1054
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:38,516
Sue, we appreciate the very
strange lengths you went

1055
00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:41,155
to push us both to the altar, but...

1056
00:41:41,181 --> 00:41:42,181
What are we doing here?

1057
00:41:42,478 --> 00:41:44,174
Well, I have one last gift

1058
00:41:44,208 --> 00:41:47,342
for both of you, my legacy couples,

1059
00:41:47,368 --> 00:41:49,444
and I wanted to give them to you myself.

1060
00:41:49,478 --> 00:41:50,623
(chuckles)

1061
00:41:50,649 --> 00:41:52,315
Don't worry, it's not a song.

1062
00:41:52,501 --> 00:41:54,551
Or a minority choir.

1063
00:41:55,353 --> 00:41:57,220
Now, I realize, uh...

1064
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:01,024
that you all see me as
a driven, richly complex,

1065
00:42:01,059 --> 00:42:03,110
emotionally bipolar role model,

1066
00:42:03,259 --> 00:42:04,939
but after all these years,

1067
00:42:05,071 --> 00:42:07,884
I can't help but see you as my own kids.

1068
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:10,470
Inside each of your envelopes
you will find your very own

1069
00:42:10,496 --> 00:42:12,344
honeymoon showcase showdown.

1070
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:13,804
Oh, but we already booked a honeymoon.

1071
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:15,972
Oh, but I canceled that honeymoon.

1072
00:42:16,007 --> 00:42:18,742
A weekend trip to Provincetown?

1073
00:42:18,776 --> 00:42:21,389
Staying in Andrew
Sullivan's cabana house? Wow!

1074
00:42:21,415 --> 00:42:23,146
SUE: Well, Andrew's an old
friend of mine. Or he used to be.

1075
00:42:23,181 --> 00:42:25,178
We're not speaking now; it's a long story.

1076
00:42:25,204 --> 00:42:26,702
A month-long, all-expenses-paid trip

1077
00:42:26,728 --> 00:42:28,561
to the Atlantis Resort on Paradise Island

1078
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,920
- in the Bahamas.
- In the Bahamas.

1079
00:42:29,954 --> 00:42:31,588
- Oh, my gosh, no way!
- That's where Wonder Woman was born!

1080
00:42:31,622 --> 00:42:33,357
- Lassos of Truth included!
- (babbling)

1081
00:42:33,391 --> 00:42:34,558
It's crazy!

1082
00:42:34,592 --> 00:42:35,559
- Oh, my God...
- Thank you.

1083
00:42:36,128 --> 00:42:37,729
SUE: Live, love, prosper.

1084
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:38,428
And I've gotta come up with

1085
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:40,049
some new shipper fodder.

1086
00:42:40,075 --> 00:42:41,264
Hmm. How 'bout PuckCedes?

1087
00:42:41,299 --> 00:42:43,166
How's that? Or FaBerry?

1088
00:42:43,201 --> 00:42:44,784
Can't get enough of the lesbians.

1089
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,036
You're the best. (giggling)

1090
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,738
SUE: FaBerry...

1091
00:42:48,117 --> 00:42:49,718
I can't believe we actually did this.

1092
00:42:49,752 --> 00:42:51,720
I can't believe we survived that party.

1093
00:42:51,754 --> 00:42:53,722
BRITTANY: Oh, my gosh...

1094
00:42:53,756 --> 00:42:55,757
I can't believe we have
the same anniversary now.

1095
00:42:55,791 --> 00:42:57,525
I can't... wait, hold up. What was that?

1096
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,527
Yeah, you guys, we're
in this together now.

1097
00:42:59,562 --> 00:43:01,565
Okay? You can count on us. And
I think we should make a pact,

1098
00:43:01,591 --> 00:43:03,359
to, um, celebrate our
anniversaries together

1099
00:43:03,385 --> 00:43:04,719
every year for the rest of our lives.

1100
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:06,082
- Or maybe like every fifth year?
- Fifth.

1101
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,314
- Okay.
- That's okay.

1102
00:43:08,349 --> 00:43:10,083
- I think we must do it every year.
- Skype.

1103
00:43:10,118 --> 00:43:11,585
- We can Skype, like, every year or something.
- Sure...
