00:38:24,337 --> 00:38:27,465
Now why would
I choose to do that?

I know you and you.

729
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,343
Double trouble.

730
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:38,782
You owe me!

731
00:38:38,851 --> 00:38:40,842
Ancient history,
mate.

732
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:45,556
Meat, you two.

733
00:38:45,626 --> 00:38:47,491
He's got a point.

734
00:38:47,561 --> 00:38:50,257
And a rather
sharp one, at that.

(BOTH SCREAMING)

736
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,235
Thank you for
releasing the dogs,

00:39:01,308 --> 00:39:03,173
you'll free the

739
00:39:04,311 --> 00:39:06,176
Free them?

740
00:39:06,246 --> 00:39:08,476
I'm gonna eat some.

741
00:39:08,882 --> 00:39:11,749
Those boys?
They'll give you indigestion.

742
00:39:12,085 --> 00:39:13,382
Don't care.

743
00:39:13,454 --> 00:39:15,581
Collecting on
an old debt.

744
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:17,322
They owe
you money?

745
00:39:17,391 --> 00:39:19,018
No, lives.

746
00:39:19,493 --> 00:39:22,894
They wanted to cross my bridge.

747
00:39:22,963 --> 00:39:24,863
LIANA: But there
isn't any bridge.

748
00:39:25,098 --> 00:39:28,659
Course there is,
if you answer my riddle.

749
00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:31,870
And they failed,
just like everyone else.

750
00:39:32,506 --> 00:39:34,133
Ask us your riddle.

751
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:36,802
If we answer correctly,
you let them go.

752
00:39:36,877 --> 00:39:40,313
If we don't, you have dinner
for tomorrow night, too.

753
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,779
It's a deal.

754
00:39:42,115 --> 00:39:44,083
Are you ready?

755
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:45,550
Of course.

(CLEARS THROAT)

757
00:39:47,856 --> 00:39:51,257
What instrument
can you hear,

758
00:39:51,326 --> 00:39:53,055
but can't see

759
00:39:53,127 --> 00:39:55,220
and can't touch?

760
00:39:56,731 --> 00:39:59,666
It's a trick. There's no
instrument like that.

761
00:40:00,335 --> 00:40:02,565

762
00:40:02,637 --> 00:40:03,831
No.

Melody, what
do you think?

764
00:40:06,508 --> 00:40:07,634
I don't know.

765
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:09,677
You play every
instrument I know

766
00:40:09,744 --> 00:40:12,042
with either your hands
or your mouth.

767
00:40:12,714 --> 00:40:16,081
Right. Your hands
or your mouth...

768
00:40:21,155 --> 00:40:23,623
Your time is...

769
00:40:23,691 --> 00:40:25,852
The answer is,
your voice.

770
00:40:25,927 --> 00:40:28,657
You can't see it or touch it,
but when you sing,

can hear it.

We can't.

that picture?

anymore, Liana.

Are you okay?

793
00:41:31,126 --> 00:41:32,923
Do we have
a little water?

794
00:41:32,995 --> 00:41:34,360
We ran out.

795
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:37,422
About an hour after
we ran out of food.

796
00:41:37,499 --> 00:41:38,796
Oh.

797
00:41:38,867 --> 00:41:40,027

something.

not that far.

royal lives here.

Hopefully someone
generous and royal.

00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,698
The legend.

It's been foretold
two friends,

815

best friends, will come
to live in the hall.

816

For years, we've been
tending the hall

until the rightful
owners arrive.

be mistaken.

No. It's just as
the legend foretold.

believe it.

believe it.

think, Melody?

about legends and destiny.

could be yours.

it's ours...

it's a perfect home for us.

a beautiful
dress every day

839
00:44:13,425 --> 00:44:15,552
and a gorgeous
garden.

840
00:44:15,627 --> 00:44:17,652
But we can't stay.

841
00:44:17,729 --> 00:44:19,663
Why not?
It's ours.

842
00:44:19,731 --> 00:44:21,426
We're finally having
some good luck,

843
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,195
why can't
we enjoy it?

844
00:44:23,268 --> 00:44:26,999
Maybe we can come back after we
take Melody to the Diamond Castle.

845
00:44:27,072 --> 00:44:28,539
If we come back.

846
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:30,034
What do you mean?

847
00:44:30,108 --> 00:44:32,633
Trolls, serpents,
evil magic.

848
00:44:33,178 --> 00:44:34,702
We may not live
to come back.

849
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,873
We promised Melody
we'd help her.

850
00:44:36,948 --> 00:44:39,940
And we did.
We've taken her this far.

851
00:44:40,018 --> 00:44:42,646
I can't go
any farther.

852
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:43,745
I can't.

853
00:44:43,822 --> 00:44:45,050
But, we promised.

854
00:44:45,123 --> 00:44:46,283
You gave your word.

855
00:44:46,358 --> 00:44:48,223
Let Ian and
Jeremy do it.

856
00:44:48,293 --> 00:44:50,056
I'm staying here.

857
00:44:50,295 --> 00:44:51,762
You don't mean that.

858
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:53,354
Yes, I do.

859
00:44:53,431 --> 00:44:56,457
Please, don't argue.
You've done enough.

860
00:44:56,968 --> 00:44:59,436
See, even
Melody thinks so.

861
00:44:59,504 --> 00:45:00,971
Stay with me.

862
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:05,534
If we don't stop Lydia,
we'll all be living under a dark cloud.

863
00:45:05,645 --> 00:45:09,081
No laughter, no music,
just sadness everywhere.

864
00:45:09,148 --> 00:45:11,309
Why us?
Why can't somebody else do it?

865
00:45:11,384 --> 00:45:13,147
Because Melody
is our friend.

866
00:45:13,219 --> 00:45:15,653
You're choosing
Melody over me.

867
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:18,781
No, it's
not like that.

868
00:45:18,858 --> 00:45:21,622
If you were really my friend,
you'd understand.

869
00:45:22,528 --> 00:45:23,859
You're right,

870
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,761
I don't understand.

871
00:45:25,832 --> 00:45:27,595
Come on,

872
00:45:28,701 --> 00:45:29,895

(LAUGHS)

879
00:46:31,198 --> 00:46:33,166
Liked the manor,
did you?

880
00:46:33,233 --> 00:46:35,861
So terribly
tempting.

881
00:46:35,936 --> 00:46:37,198
How did you know?

882
00:46:37,304 --> 00:46:39,101
Because I was
there first.

883
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:41,936
Did the servants tell
you about a legend?

884
00:46:42,009 --> 00:46:43,909
Yes, they said
that two...

885
00:46:44,845 --> 00:46:47,006
They were under
your power.

886
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,513
Mmm-hmm.

887
00:46:48,582 --> 00:46:51,050
Now, give me
the mirror.

888
00:46:51,618 --> 00:46:53,552

have it.

No mirror,

893
00:47:13,308 --> 00:47:15,640
So, the other
girl has it.

894
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:16,904
Where is
your friend,

895
00:47:16,978 --> 00:47:19,572
or should I say
ex-friend?

00:47:19,647 --> 00:47:22,241
I don't know.

That doesn't
work on me.

Bold words for a girl who
no longer wears her necklace.

899
00:47:29,891 --> 00:47:33,850
As long as you and your friend wore
your guardian stones, you were protected.

00:47:33,928 --> 00:47:35,725
But now...

901
00:47:46,107 --> 00:47:47,540
Where is she?

902
00:47:47,608 --> 00:47:51,100
Going to the
Seven Stones.

903
00:47:51,179 --> 00:47:53,374
Slyder, get the
girl and the mirror.

904
00:47:53,448 --> 00:47:55,473
And this time,
do it right.

Yes, mistress.

00:48:11,166 --> 00:48:12,963
This must be it,
right?

907
00:48:13,702 --> 00:48:15,829
MELODY: The Seven Stones!
We're here!

908
00:48:15,904 --> 00:48:18,168
We're really here.
You did it.

909
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,267
Just down there is the misty
glade and the Diamond Castle.

910
00:48:26,215 --> 00:48:27,910
I wish Alexa
were with us.

911
00:48:27,983 --> 00:48:30,884
Yes, well, she
made her choice.

912
00:48:31,286 --> 00:48:33,720
Liana, I know
you miss her.

913
00:48:34,256 --> 00:48:36,850
Miss her?
Why would I miss her?

914
00:48:36,925 --> 00:48:39,655
We've only been friends for
as long as I can remember.

915
00:48:39,728 --> 00:48:42,026
She's been with me through the
best and worst times of my life.

916
00:48:42,097 --> 00:48:43,086
(BARKS)

917
00:48:43,165 --> 00:48:46,760
She knows me better than anyone
else in the entire universe.

918
00:48:47,603 --> 00:48:49,935
I feel like a part
of me is gone.

919
00:48:50,272 --> 00:48:52,103
(BARKING)

920
00:48:52,174 --> 00:48:53,664
What is it?

921
00:48:56,812 --> 00:48:58,871
LIANA: (GRUNTS)
Put me down.

922
00:48:58,947 --> 00:49:01,814
SLYDER: Mistress Lydia
will be glad to see you.

923
00:49:01,884 --> 00:49:03,078
(WHOOPING)

924
00:49:09,825 --> 00:49:12,316
Welcome, darling.

925
00:49:12,861 --> 00:49:14,887
I have nothing
to say to you.

926
00:49:15,031 --> 00:49:16,020
Aw!

927
00:49:16,099 --> 00:49:18,465
That must be because
you're lonely.

928
00:49:18,535 --> 00:49:21,698
Alexa, won't
you join us?

929
00:49:24,307 --> 00:49:26,798
Alexa!
Alexa!

930
00:49:29,913 --> 00:49:31,938
She told me where to find you.

931
00:49:32,015 --> 00:49:35,473
Friends are highly
overrated, don't you think?

932
00:49:37,854 --> 00:49:39,754
And here it is.

933
00:49:39,856 --> 00:49:43,849
Ah! So much trouble
for such a little apprentice.

934
00:49:45,128 --> 00:49:47,995
Melody, I know
you can hear me.

935
00:49:48,465 --> 00:49:51,696
Melody,
come out now.

936
00:49:52,035 --> 00:49:53,900
Oh,
stubborn girl.

937
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:56,564
Walk, Alexa, walk.

938
00:50:02,479 --> 00:50:05,812
Alexa, no!
Stop, stop!

939
00:50:05,882 --> 00:50:07,042
(TUTTING)

940
00:50:07,117 --> 00:50:09,142
She only
listens to me.

941
00:50:09,552 --> 00:50:13,352
And I'll only stop her
if Melody asks me to.

942
00:50:14,557 --> 00:50:17,493
Anything to say,
Melly Belly?

943
00:50:37,214 --> 00:50:38,545
Stop her, Lydia.

944
00:50:39,016 --> 00:50:40,415
Girl, wait.

945
00:50:45,523 --> 00:50:47,957
I want the key to
the Diamond Castle.

946
00:50:48,025 --> 00:50:50,255
Let my friends go.

947
00:50:50,327 --> 00:50:51,919
Ha! The key first,

948
00:50:51,996 --> 00:50:53,554
and show me
where the castle is,

949
00:50:53,631 --> 00:50:55,121
then I'll release them.

950
00:50:57,601 --> 00:50:59,228
(WHIMPERING)

951
00:51:00,037 --> 00:51:01,265
Okay.

952
00:51:01,338 --> 00:51:03,636
But we come right
back to let them go.

953
00:51:03,707 --> 00:51:06,471
Oh, there's
a good girl.

954
00:51:06,977 --> 00:51:09,172
Meet me
outside, Slyder.

955
00:51:10,314 --> 00:51:12,009
When you're ready.

956
00:51:14,652 --> 00:51:15,983
(EXCLAIMS)

957
00:51:22,327 --> 00:51:24,693

wake up.

958
00:51:24,763 --> 00:51:26,697
It's me, Liana.

959
00:51:27,399 --> 00:51:29,765
On behalf of my
great mistress,

960
00:51:29,834 --> 00:51:32,632

only Muse.

00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:46,574
Aw.

964
00:51:46,651 --> 00:51:49,449
Nothing like
a sad ending.

965
00:52:00,298 --> 00:52:01,993
West, I presume?

966
00:52:03,201 --> 00:52:04,190
Yes.

967
00:52:16,881 --> 00:52:18,746
(SIGHS)
No sign of them.

968
00:52:18,817 --> 00:52:20,546
Must have gone
without us.

969
00:52:20,619 --> 00:52:21,847
Disappointing.

970
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,786
To say the least.

Oh, hang on.

00:52:28,761 --> 00:52:31,559
Okay, okay,
what's the rush?

974
00:52:31,631 --> 00:52:33,223
Where's Liana?

975
00:52:35,234 --> 00:52:37,634
Why do I have
a bad feeling?

976
00:52:38,104 --> 00:52:39,571
Where are they, girl?

977

(URGING HORSES)

00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:55,220
I'm sorry,
Alexa.

979
00:52:55,288 --> 00:52:56,915
Why did I
ever leave?

980
00:52:56,989 --> 00:52:58,718
I'm so sorry.

00:53:02,228 --> 00:53:03,388
Lily?

983
00:53:05,164 --> 00:53:07,132
That's Alexa's
necklace.

984
00:53:08,067 --> 00:53:11,969
We were both wearing the necklaces
when Lydia couldn't mesmerize us.

985
00:53:14,674 --> 00:53:17,871
Drop, Lily,
it's okay.

986
00:53:23,316 --> 00:53:25,079
Please let
this work.

987
00:53:25,852 --> 00:53:31,119
Best friends, today,
tomorrow and always.

988
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:49,468
Liana,

989
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:51,336
where are we?

990
00:53:52,179 --> 00:53:55,342
In trouble, but then,
what else is new?

991
00:53:56,516 --> 00:53:57,710
What happened?

992
00:53:57,784 --> 00:53:59,376
Lydia has Melody.

993
00:53:59,453 --> 00:54:00,545
No!

994
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:02,747
They're on their way
to the Diamond Castle.

995
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:05,917
We have to stop
them, but how?

996
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:08,451
We're going
to climb up,

997
00:54:08,528 --> 00:54:09,790
together.

998
00:54:22,075 --> 00:54:25,533
If you want me to believe
the Diamond Castle is here,

999
00:54:25,612 --> 00:54:27,079
give me the key.

1000
00:54:27,147 --> 00:54:28,274
The key...

1001
00:54:28,983 --> 00:54:31,315
Now, or I throw
you in the pond

1002
00:54:31,386 --> 00:54:33,684
and your friends never
come out of the cave.

1003
00:54:34,689 --> 00:54:36,418
The key...

1004
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:41,491
Is to place diamonds

1005
00:54:42,063 --> 00:54:43,360
in the diamond.

1006
00:54:43,431 --> 00:54:44,989
And that is...

1007
00:54:45,066 --> 00:54:46,055
The boulder.

1008
00:54:48,536 --> 00:54:50,766
Ah, I see it.

1009
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:52,403
Now what?

1010
00:54:52,473 --> 00:54:54,634
Each slot
holds a diamond.

1011

Placed in
the proper order,

1012
00:54:56,477 --> 00:54:58,707
the castle will
then be revealed.

1013
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:00,748
Where do I begin?

1014
00:55:02,283 --> 00:55:05,252
I'm so sorry, Liana,
about everything I said.

1015
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:08,419

I see you'll
follow us anywhere.

Look at that. Again you show
up just when we need you.

everything.

Mmm-hmm.

1027
00:55:56,338 --> 00:55:58,636
And then to the
right, two spaces.

1028
00:55:58,707 --> 00:56:00,265
LYDIA: Ooh, the last one.

1029
00:56:00,642 --> 00:56:02,633
So horribly exciting.

1030
00:56:23,131 --> 00:56:26,123
Where's
the castle?

1031
00:56:26,802 --> 00:56:29,896
You see, there are
a few more steps.

1032
00:56:33,408 --> 00:56:36,003
JEREMY: You actually think
this mad plan will work?

1033
00:56:36,212 --> 00:56:37,304
LIANA: It has to.

1034
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:40,781
Once Lydia finds the castle and
destroys the musical instruments,

1035
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:43,148
nobody will ever
be able to stop her.

1036

Diamonds aren't
the key at all.

will come rescue you.
