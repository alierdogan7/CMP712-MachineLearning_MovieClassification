00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:10,200
I think I kind of like her.
I don't want her to get hurt.

00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,109
<i>She's just kind of...
you know, terrible.</i>

00:00:19,177 --> 00:00:21,387

we have a real shot at

The Ohio Show Choir chat rooms
have all been buzzing

15
00:00:29,954 --> 00:00:31,555
about how Vocal Adrenaline
has lost a step.

16
00:00:31,622 --> 00:00:33,423
I agree-- the judges know
all of their tricks

17
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:34,691
and now that we have Jessie,

18
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:36,293
they've lost
their best performer.

19
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,629
You guys have to come to the
auditorium-- it's an emergency!

What are you doing
up there with them?

23
00:00:50,775 --> 00:00:52,976
I've transferred back
to Carmel High, Rachel.

24
00:00:53,044 --> 00:00:54,845
I'm sorry that
it's come to this,

25
00:00:54,912 --> 00:00:57,080
but you guys were awful to me.

26
00:00:57,148 --> 00:00:58,515
You never accepted me,

27
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:00,717
you never listened
to my clearly superior ideas.

28
00:01:00,785 --> 00:01:03,053
Why are you here
in our auditorium?

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,654
The blogs and the chat rooms
say that we're finished,

30
00:01:04,722 --> 00:01:06,323
and that you guys are ripe
to topple us.

31
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,557
We just wanted to show you

00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,993
a something we came up with
a few days ago

33
00:01:10,061 --> 00:01:12,195
to see if you agree
with that assessment.

<i>ARTIE:
It's a Carmel High tradition.</i>

68
00:02:38,316 --> 00:02:40,817
They psych out the competition
a few weeks before the big show.

69
00:02:40,885 --> 00:02:42,619
They call it a funkification.

70
00:02:42,687 --> 00:02:44,154
Meaning they show us
what they've got,

71
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:45,989
and we spiral
into a deep black funk.

72
00:02:46,057 --> 00:02:47,591
Yeah. Yeah, we used to do
the same thing

73
00:02:47,658 --> 00:02:49,159
to other football teams.

74
00:02:49,226 --> 00:02:50,727
You know, try and get inside
their head before a big game,

75
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,495
pull little pranks
to intimidate them.

76
00:02:52,563 --> 00:02:54,631
Yeah, well, the difference was
our football team sucked.

77
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:55,899
Those guys are golden.

KURT: Come on, keep
your heads up, guys.

79
00:02:57,568 --> 00:02:58,635
It's going to take
more than that

80
00:02:58,703 --> 00:03:00,904
to get us into a funk.

TINA:
I feel so violated.

82
00:03:10,114 --> 00:03:11,948
It's like someone
broke into our home.

83
00:03:12,016 --> 00:03:14,117
Look, it was just
a lame little prank.

84
00:03:14,185 --> 00:03:15,785
And the fact that they're
trying to get to us

85
00:03:15,853 --> 00:03:17,754
means maybe we
got them spooked.

86
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:20,090
Uh-uh, Mr. Shue.
They aren't afraid of anything.

87
00:03:20,157 --> 00:03:22,225
That number they did
was fantastic.

88
00:03:22,293 --> 00:03:23,660
You know, which doesn't
make any sense.

89
00:03:23,728 --> 00:03:24,761
They had all that equipment.

90
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:25,962
How did they even get in?

91
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,097
I gave 'em all keys.

92
00:03:27,164 --> 00:03:28,298
Helped them do a sound check

93
00:03:28,366 --> 00:03:30,200

94
00:03:30,267 --> 00:03:31,635
Hey, this way, fellas.

00:03:31,702 --> 00:03:33,303
Let's punch out this wall here.

96
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:35,805
That'll open up the space a little bit.
Sue, what are you doing?

97
00:03:35,873 --> 00:03:37,273
I can't talk to you now,
William.

00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:39,442
Drafting class is helping me
redecorate around here.

99
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,144
You see, I have Nationals
over the weekend,

100
00:03:41,212 --> 00:03:42,912
and I expect to return
with a comically large

101
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,214
first place trophy for which

102
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:46,583
I have absolutely no room
in my trophy case.

103
00:03:46,651 --> 00:03:48,585
As soon as you hurry up
and lose at Regionals,

104
00:03:48,653 --> 00:03:51,321
this choir room will become
my official trophy annex.

105
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:53,256
You know what it
has to look like?

106
00:03:53,324 --> 00:03:56,726
Elvis' gold record
room at Graceland.

107
00:03:56,794 --> 00:03:58,728
Except I'll be wanting
far fewer morbidly obese

108
00:03:58,796 --> 00:04:00,764
white women waddling
around and crying.

109
00:04:00,831 --> 00:04:02,432
Sue, get out of my room.

110
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,402
Glee Clubbers, for you those
of you whose hearing

111
00:04:05,469 --> 00:04:09,305
has not been damaged by massive
doses of Acutane, listen up.

112
00:04:09,373 --> 00:04:11,675
In a few weeks,
Glee Club will be finished.

113
00:04:11,742 --> 00:04:13,109
Now how do I know that?

114
00:04:13,177 --> 00:04:15,745
Well, I recently checked
the odds with my Vegas bookie,

115
00:04:15,813 --> 00:04:19,282
who told me that you're 40-1
underdogs at Regionals.

116
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,984
You are going to lose,
and your dreams

117
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,052
will be crushed.

118
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:23,687
Sue, can I see your trophy?

119
00:04:23,754 --> 00:04:24,921
Sure, Will.

120
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:25,955
Hope and dream.

121
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,029
You dropped your trophy, Sue.

122
00:04:33,097 --> 00:04:35,632
You know, for me,
trophies are like herpes.

123
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,735
You can try to get rid of them,
but they just keep coming.

124
00:04:38,803 --> 00:04:40,437
You know why?

125
00:04:40,504 --> 00:04:43,873
Sue Sylvester has hourly
flare-ups of burning, itchy,

126
00:04:43,941 --> 00:04:45,308

00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:49,279

00:05:29,587 --> 00:05:33,123
Well...

137
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,991
By the power vested in me
by the bar association

138
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:37,494
of the great State of Ohio,

139
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:40,597
I know pronounce you
no longer husband and wife.

140
00:05:40,664 --> 00:05:42,565
Mazel tov.

00:06:01,318 --> 00:06:04,053
You're still that
16-year-old boy to me.

143
00:06:05,356 --> 00:06:07,223
You always will be.

144
00:06:21,505 --> 00:06:22,939

{bell ringing}

146
00:06:25,342 --> 00:06:29,045
All right, guys, today I want
to talk to you about regrets.

147
00:06:29,113 --> 00:06:30,413
Who has some?

148
00:06:30,481 --> 00:06:33,149
Giving my heart to Jessie,
just to have it crushed

149
00:06:33,217 --> 00:06:35,084
<i>like the stage floor
at a performance of Stomp.</i>

150
00:06:35,152 --> 00:06:38,087
Thinking "trust me" was
a sensible birth control option.

151
00:06:38,155 --> 00:06:39,255
We all have them.

152
00:06:39,323 --> 00:06:41,324
I just finalized my divorce.

153
00:06:41,392 --> 00:06:42,158
I regret
living in a relationship

154
00:06:42,226 --> 00:06:43,860
that wasn't working.

155
00:06:43,928 --> 00:06:46,729
Letting her put me
in these deep funks

156
00:06:46,797 --> 00:06:48,198
and not fighting back.

157
00:06:48,265 --> 00:06:51,134
Besides creeping us out,
why are you telling us this?

158
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:54,804
Because if we lose to
Vocal Adrenaline at Regionals,

159
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,206
none of us are
going to regret it.

160
00:06:56,273 --> 00:06:57,373
We will have given
it our best shot

161
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:59,142
and we won't look back.

162
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,711
But we will regret letting them
get the best of us

163
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:03,246
before the competition.

164
00:07:03,314 --> 00:07:06,049
Which is why we need to hit them
back just like they hit us.

165
00:07:06,116 --> 00:07:10,286
So you want us
to TP their choir room?

166
00:07:10,354 --> 00:07:12,789
Whatever the better,
cooler version of that is.

167
00:07:12,857 --> 00:07:16,559
Like, uh, maybe-maybe we should
steal their school statue.

168
00:07:16,627 --> 00:07:18,027
Their school statue

169
00:07:18,095 --> 00:07:21,531
is a giant bronze of a great
white shark eating a seal pup.

170
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:24,300
It weighs three tons.

171
00:07:24,368 --> 00:07:25,702
Okay, how about this one.

172
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:27,503
All right, we get like...

173
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:29,305
<i>PUCK: Everyone knows this
is going to come down to me.</i>

174
00:07:29,373 --> 00:07:32,976
<i>Revenge, fear, the merciless
infliction of pain.</i>

175
00:07:33,043 --> 00:07:35,211
<i>These are my kingdoms.</i>

176
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,481
<i>First time I gave a wedgie
to a kid, I was four years old.</i>

177
00:07:38,549 --> 00:07:41,284
<i>Finn and I may still hate
each other for some reason,</i>

178
00:07:41,352 --> 00:07:44,587
<i>but we both know that defending
the honor of New Directions</i>

179
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:46,856
<i>is going to be our dirty job.</i>

180
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,725
{dog barking in distance}

181
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:50,627
{hissing}

182
00:07:54,732 --> 00:07:55,965
Yeah, I did it.

183
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:58,368
And I'm proud. All I did
was step up and be a man.

184
00:07:58,435 --> 00:08:00,169
They got what was coming
to them.

185
00:08:00,237 --> 00:08:01,371
A few of my students
TP'd your choir room.

186
00:08:01,438 --> 00:08:03,606
You slashed the tires
on the Range Rovers

187
00:08:03,674 --> 00:08:06,242
of all 26 of my performers.

188
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,477
Those were gifts for
our win at Sectionals.

189
00:08:07,544 --> 00:08:08,678
That's 200 times 26

190
00:08:08,746 --> 00:08:09,946
times four equals...

191
00:08:10,014 --> 00:08:11,681
I don't have a calculator.

192
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:13,650
I'm sorry, you bought
all your kids Range Rovers?

193
00:08:13,717 --> 00:08:15,018
We have a very active
booster club.

194
00:08:15,085 --> 00:08:16,286
Look, nobody got hurt.

195
00:08:16,353 --> 00:08:17,921
It was a harmless prank.

196
00:08:17,988 --> 00:08:20,023
SUE: That's what they said
about a young man in Chicago

197
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,858
in 1871, who thought he'd
play a harmless prank

198
00:08:21,926 --> 00:08:24,727
on the dairy cow of
one Mrs. O'Leary.

199
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,462
He successfully
ignited its flatulence

200
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,897
and a city burned, William.

201
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,499
That young terrorist
went on to become

202
00:08:29,566 --> 00:08:32,368
the first gay president
of the United States,

203
00:08:32,436 --> 00:08:33,503
Abraham Lincoln.
Enough.

204
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,438
These students
have committed a felony.

205
00:08:35,506 --> 00:08:37,240
They are hereby expelled.

206
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:41,210
Look, I don't want anyone
to get expelled.

207
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:42,946
I'm not going
to press charges...

208
00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:44,914
as long as you pay
for the damage.

209
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,883
You can take it out
of the glee club budget.

210
00:08:46,951 --> 00:08:48,017
That'll bankrupt the glee club.

211
00:08:48,085 --> 00:08:49,419
We don't have that kind
of money.

212
00:08:49,486 --> 00:08:50,520
We'll get jobs.

213
00:08:50,587 --> 00:08:52,021
Give us a month.

214
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:53,289
We'll pay you back,

215
00:08:53,357 --> 00:08:54,824
Ms. Corcoran, I promise.

216
00:08:54,892 --> 00:08:56,693
Fine.

217
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,862
Ms. Corcoran, you are
as wise and magnanimous

218
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,064
as you are beautiful.

219
00:09:03,634 --> 00:09:07,170
Thank you.

220
00:09:07,237 --> 00:09:08,705
Well, you just can't
win, can you, William?

221
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:11,641
You never have,
and you never will.

222
00:09:17,004 --> 00:09:19,806
Are you want to take a trip down that
rabbit hole, William?

223
00:09:19,874 --> 00:09:21,741
I'm willing to try
anything, Sandy.

224
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:24,277
I'm just really depressed.

225
00:09:24,345 --> 00:09:26,179
I don't sell to the
clinically depressed.

226
00:09:26,247 --> 00:09:28,014
You'll throw yourself
off a parking garage

227
00:09:28,082 --> 00:09:30,350
and I can't have that
on my conscience.

228
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:32,318
I used to coach that glee club.

229
00:09:32,386 --> 00:09:34,754
I know what you're up against.

230
00:09:34,822 --> 00:09:37,790
You think Carmel High didn't
put the fear of God in me?

231
00:09:37,858 --> 00:09:40,326
I don't know how we
can possibly beat them.

232
00:09:40,394 --> 00:09:42,495
Glee is hanging by a thread.

233
00:09:42,563 --> 00:09:46,633
William, the answer is
right in front of your face,

234
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,601
but you can't see it
because you're in

235
00:09:48,669 --> 00:09:49,903
too big of a funk.

236
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:54,674
Vocal Adrenaline
has a weakness.

237
00:09:54,742 --> 00:09:57,410
{bell ringing}

238
00:09:57,478 --> 00:09:58,945
Funk.

239
00:09:59,013 --> 00:10:00,613
Use it in a sentence.

240
00:10:00,681 --> 00:10:01,781
Come on.

241
00:10:01,849 --> 00:10:03,616
Rachel.

242
00:10:03,684 --> 00:10:05,985
This cheese smells funky.

243
00:10:06,053 --> 00:10:07,186
That's because
it's "from-unda" cheese.

244
00:10:07,254 --> 00:10:08,421
Shut it, Puckerman!

245
00:10:08,489 --> 00:10:09,889
Okay, okay.

246
00:10:09,957 --> 00:10:11,724
I was thinking more
along the lines of...

247
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:13,860
Vocal Adrenaline has sure
put us all in a funk.

248
00:10:13,928 --> 00:10:16,195
I'm so depressed, I've worn
the same outfit twice this week.

249
00:10:16,263 --> 00:10:17,764
What if I told you

250
00:10:17,831 --> 00:10:19,999
I knew how we could shove it
right back down their throats?

251
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:21,301
New Directions is about

252
00:10:21,368 --> 00:10:23,670
to make their funk the P-Funk.

253
00:10:23,737 --> 00:10:25,939
We are going to get funked up.

254
00:10:26,006 --> 00:10:28,641
The only way to do that
is to beat them at Regionals.

255
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:31,110
Vocal Adrenaline has never once
done a funk number.

256
00:10:31,178 --> 00:10:33,579
They're a machine,
a collective, synthesized,

257
00:10:33,647 --> 00:10:36,115
soulless beat.

258
00:10:36,183 --> 00:10:37,951
Funk is soul meets anger.

259
00:10:38,018 --> 00:10:39,919
Its passion is in its emotion.

260
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:42,221
And Vocal Adrenaline doesn't
perform with any.

261
00:10:42,289 --> 00:10:44,090
So you have your assignment.

262
00:10:44,158 --> 00:10:46,659
I want you guys
to turn McKinley High into...

263
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:48,561
¶¶Funky town! ¶¶

264
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:51,464
You guys can relax,
I got this one covered.

265
00:10:51,532 --> 00:10:52,699
Cool.

266
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:53,900
Hold on a second.

267
00:10:53,968 --> 00:10:55,134
I-I want a chance
to get funky, too.

268
00:10:55,202 --> 00:10:56,669
{laughter}

269
00:10:57,805 --> 00:10:59,605
{laughing}:
Good one, Quinn.

270
00:10:59,673 --> 00:11:01,274
It even sounds funny
when you say it.

271
00:11:01,342 --> 00:11:04,077
You said funk
was about soul and anger.

272
00:11:04,144 --> 00:11:05,478
<i>I have plenty of both.</i>

273
00:11:05,546 --> 00:11:07,380
Look at me. Look at my life.

274
00:11:07,448 --> 00:11:08,448
I'm furious!

275
00:11:08,515 --> 00:11:09,615
MERCEDES:
Let's be honest.

276
00:11:09,683 --> 00:11:10,984
When white people try
to be funky,

277
00:11:11,051 --> 00:11:13,987
you end up with KC
and the Sunshine Band.

278
00:11:14,054 --> 00:11:15,088
I love "Boogie Shoes."

279
00:11:15,155 --> 00:11:16,856
Mercedes' racism aside,

280
00:11:16,924 --> 00:11:19,559
I will have something prepared
tomorrow.

281
00:11:19,626 --> 00:11:21,394
All right, Quinn goes first.

282
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:24,564
{bell ringing}

283
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,868
Rachel, can I see you
in my office?

284
00:11:30,204 --> 00:11:32,605
You seem to be taking
this Jessie thing pretty hard.

285
00:11:32,673 --> 00:11:34,941
I want him to be eaten
by a lion.

286
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:36,476
{sighs}
Jessie, cared about you.

287
00:11:36,543 --> 00:11:37,944
No, he didn't.

288
00:11:38,012 --> 00:11:40,613
Our entire relationship
was just some diabolical plan.

289
00:11:40,681 --> 00:11:42,448
They knew if they broke my heart

290
00:11:42,516 --> 00:11:43,516
close enough
to the competition,

291
00:11:43,584 --> 00:11:45,218
that I'd lose my will to live,

292
00:11:45,285 --> 00:11:47,086
and then New Directions
would have no chance

293
00:11:47,154 --> 00:11:48,421
at winning Regionals.

294
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:50,323
It's textbook;
You destroy the heart

295
00:11:50,391 --> 00:11:53,092
of the team's heart
and you destroy the team.

296
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,228
<i>WILL: Sandy told me how to
beat Vocal Adrenaline,</i>

297
00:11:55,295 --> 00:11:57,063
<i>and now Rachel was
inadvertently telling me</i>

298
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:59,565
<i>how to beat my other nemesis.</i>

299
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:02,702
<i>Suddenly, I wasn't feeling
nearly as depressed.</i>

300
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,504
{playing tentative melody}

301
00:12:04,571 --> 00:12:07,206
William, I'm gonna have
to ask you to clear out.

302
00:12:07,274 --> 00:12:08,808
I received an anonymous
tip from someone

303
00:12:08,876 --> 00:12:10,543
who wants to meet me here

304
00:12:10,611 --> 00:12:12,145
to discuss
an illegal Hot Cheetos ring.

305
00:12:12,212 --> 00:12:13,546
Hot Cheetos have been proven

306
00:12:13,614 --> 00:12:15,982
to raise endorphins,
which makes for happy kids,

307
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,150
and I can't have that.

308
00:12:17,217 --> 00:12:18,317
Yeah, no worries, Sue.

309
00:12:18,385 --> 00:12:19,619
I'll just find
someplace else to...

310
00:12:19,686 --> 00:12:22,088
Oh, wow.

311
00:12:22,156 --> 00:12:22,755
What?

312
00:12:22,823 --> 00:12:24,524
It-it's nothing.

313
00:12:24,591 --> 00:12:27,126
It's just... it's just the way
the light hit you

314
00:12:27,194 --> 00:12:29,228
just now, you looked stunning.

315
00:12:30,597 --> 00:12:32,732
No, you're radiant.

316
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,200
Well, the week before Nationals
every year,

317
00:12:34,268 --> 00:12:35,802
I have a placenta mask

318
00:12:35,869 --> 00:12:38,604
right after a rigorous session
of microdermabrasion.

319
00:12:38,672 --> 00:12:41,707
Well, whatever you're doing,
keep it up

320
00:12:41,775 --> 00:12:45,144
because you have
never looked better.

321
00:12:47,948 --> 00:12:50,349
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I should...

322
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:51,784
I got stuff to do, so...
Yeah, um...

323
00:12:51,852 --> 00:12:54,954
Look, Sue, I gotta ask
your advice about something.

324
00:12:55,022 --> 00:12:57,990
I know I make it seem
like I-I know what I'm doing,

325
00:12:58,058 --> 00:12:59,926
but everyone knows

326
00:12:59,993 --> 00:13:01,194
you're the kingmaker
around here.

327
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:02,328
I mean, you're this school's

328
00:13:02,396 --> 00:13:03,496
arbiter of taste.
Continue.

329
00:13:03,564 --> 00:13:04,931
We're doing this funk number
for Regionals,

330
00:13:04,998 --> 00:13:06,532
and I wanted
to pick your brain about it.

331
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,335
I-I just wanted to know
if it's too suggestive.

332
00:13:09,403 --> 00:13:11,304
And I only need
two minutes of your time.

333
00:13:11,371 --> 00:13:13,106
Okay.

334

So...

356
00:15:00,347 --> 00:15:01,814
you feel anything there?

357
00:15:01,882 --> 00:15:03,482
No.

358
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,651
Was I...

359
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:06,786
too dirty?

360
00:15:06,853 --> 00:15:08,421
I didn't notice. I was bored.

361
00:15:11,058 --> 00:15:12,892
Okay.

362
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,392
Right, left, and flip, okay?

363
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:28,893
Can I go shirtless
under this apron?

364
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,195
Look, I only hired
you two losers

365
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,364
because I'm desperate
to increase my quarterly sales

366
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,799
and you'll work for less
than immigrants.

367
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,667
As I'm you know,

368
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,403
Mr. Schuester and I
are now officially divorced.

369
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,005
I mean, I'm sure he talks
about it all the time.

370
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:45,476
Anyway, I'm on my own now.

371
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:48,746
And I need to make manager
by the end of the year

372
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,249
so that I can maintain
my lifestyle.

373
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:53,951
Terri, that guy who gave
me Bell's palsy is

374
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,353
back again today.

375
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:56,354
So...

376
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,855
help him.

377
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:59,490
He's our best customer.

378
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,860
You need to go help him.

379
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,962
But she just told you to do it.

380
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,697
I have got seniority
over you two losers,

381
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,766
which means you have to do
what I say.

382
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,401
Well, then I need
to kick your ass.

384
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:18,075

00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,879
You're not gonna fondle us,
are you, Mr. Ryerson?

386
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,881
I've recently
redone my bathroom

387
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,983
as an homage
to Miss Jayne Mansfield.

388
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,086
Pink! It's all pink!

389
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,688
This is amaranth pink.

390
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:31,956
I need rose pink.

391
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,992
But this is all the pink
that we have.

392
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,494
Wrong answer.

393
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:39,363
Did they change the name of this
place to Losers N' Things?

394
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:40,965
Did everyone in

395
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,667
the whole world die so they had

396
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:44,669
to give these jobs
to you two morons?

397
00:16:44,736 --> 00:16:46,170
And where's my Muzak?!

398
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,873

without my Kenny G?

I destroyed my marriage.

Well...

496
00:21:21,286 --> 00:21:23,387

You're very sweet.

499
00:21:29,528 --> 00:21:31,295
You could be my second chance.

500
00:21:32,498 --> 00:21:33,965
I'm gonna change.

501
00:21:34,032 --> 00:21:35,967

502
00:21:36,034 --> 00:21:37,535

forever, right?

503
00:21:37,603 --> 00:21:40,104
Yeah. Yeah, right, I guess.

504
00:21:40,172 --> 00:21:41,439

going to help you

505
00:21:41,507 --> 00:21:42,340

a funk song, right?

508

Yeah.
Okay, so,

509
00:21:50,215 --> 00:21:52,316
we'll type "funk"
into the iTunes,

510

511

00:30:13,576 --> 00:30:15,076
Because it's infuriating.

694
00:30:15,144 --> 00:30:17,646
I hate all the looks at school.

695
00:30:17,713 --> 00:30:20,849
Don't even get me started
on Puck's mom.

696
00:30:20,917 --> 00:30:23,018
You're not angry.

697
00:30:23,085 --> 00:30:24,586
You're hurt.

698
00:30:24,654 --> 00:30:26,087
You just need someplace safe

699
00:30:26,155 --> 00:30:27,823
where you can dig through
all that rage.

700
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:30,725
Get to the pain beneath it.

701
00:30:30,793 --> 00:30:32,127
So it's decided.

702
00:30:32,195 --> 00:30:33,628
Saturday you move out
of Puck's house

703
00:30:33,696 --> 00:30:35,497
and you move in with me.

704
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:39,401
I already talked
to my mom about it.

705
00:30:39,469 --> 00:30:42,337
My brother went off to college
and we have an extra room.

706
00:30:42,405 --> 00:30:44,072
Mercedes...

707
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,941
It's cool.

708
00:30:46,008 --> 00:30:48,543
Us sisters got to stick
together, right?

709
00:30:49,645 --> 00:30:52,180
{chuckles}

710
00:30:53,216 --> 00:30:55,717
{both laughing softly}

711
00:30:57,053 --> 00:30:58,253
{doorbell rings}

712
00:31:01,357 --> 00:31:03,358
Mr. Schuester?
Yes.

713
00:31:03,426 --> 00:31:04,860
Come in.
Thank you.

714
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:09,664
Um, is she doing okay?

715
00:31:09,732 --> 00:31:11,967
Never seen her like this.

716
00:31:12,034 --> 00:31:14,436
She won't leave her room,
and refuses her protein shakes.

717
00:31:14,504 --> 00:31:16,304
Bad.

718
00:31:16,372 --> 00:31:18,740
Very bad. Well, please, tell her
I'd love to speak with her.

719
00:31:18,808 --> 00:31:20,475
Let me ask.

720
00:31:20,543 --> 00:31:21,776
Thank you.

721
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,847
Careful.

722
00:31:25,915 --> 00:31:27,516
That Regionals '85.

723
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:29,251
Very precious to Ms. Sue.

724
00:31:29,318 --> 00:31:30,352
Sorry.

725
00:31:32,788 --> 00:31:34,589
<i>Mija, Mr. Schuester
is here.</i>

726
00:31:34,657 --> 00:31:36,191
SUE: Okay.
Okay.

727
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,894
She agreed to see you.

728
00:31:38,961 --> 00:31:40,662
<i>Oh, gracias por tu ayuda.</i>

729
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:41,663
<i>De Nada.</i>

730
00:31:47,303 --> 00:31:49,538
{knocking}

731
00:31:49,605 --> 00:31:51,673
So have you come to gloat?

732
00:31:51,741 --> 00:31:55,010
I, uh...

733
00:31:55,077 --> 00:31:57,412
I hear you're pulling out
of Nationals, Sue.

734
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,947
You know, for some
of your girls

735
00:31:59,015 --> 00:32:01,616
that's going to have
some really big consequences.

736
00:32:01,684 --> 00:32:02,884
I'm tired of those kids.

737
00:32:02,952 --> 00:32:04,219
I devoted my life to them.

738
00:32:04,287 --> 00:32:06,221
And what have I got
to show for it?

739
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:10,091
Five consecutive
National championships.

740
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,893
Oh, big deal.

741
00:32:11,961 --> 00:32:14,195
I'm alone, William.

742
00:32:14,263 --> 00:32:16,398
I don't even like you
and I was willing

743
00:32:16,465 --> 00:32:18,333
to jump at the chance
to be with you.

744
00:32:18,401 --> 00:32:22,337
And, you know, for a second,

745
00:32:22,405 --> 00:32:24,306
I saw a flash of something.

746
00:32:24,373 --> 00:32:26,074
I pictured myself

747
00:32:26,142 --> 00:32:29,411
living a normal life.

748
00:32:29,478 --> 00:32:31,713
Having someone to come home to
every night.

749
00:32:34,817 --> 00:32:38,186
And though
I completely loathe you,

750
00:32:38,254 --> 00:32:40,889
you'd make
a great trophy husband.

751
00:32:40,957 --> 00:32:42,424
And as you can see

752
00:32:42,491 --> 00:32:45,594
by my decor,
I love me some trophies.

753
00:32:45,661 --> 00:32:48,430
Sue, I did what I did to you
out of anger.

754
00:32:48,497 --> 00:32:49,931
I thought destroying you

755
00:32:49,999 --> 00:32:52,701
would pull me out of my funk.

756
00:32:52,768 --> 00:32:56,538
But... just made things worse.

757
00:32:56,606 --> 00:33:00,041
So is that an apology?

758
00:33:00,109 --> 00:33:02,277
Yes, it is.

759
00:33:02,345 --> 00:33:04,846
And you're not alone, Sue.

760
00:33:04,914 --> 00:33:07,148
Your kids need you,

761
00:33:07,216 --> 00:33:09,217
<i>so you do have love
in your life.</i>

762
00:33:09,285 --> 00:33:11,586
My kids don't love me;
They fear me.

763
00:33:11,654 --> 00:33:13,688
<i>But you love them, Sue.</i>

764
00:33:19,462 --> 00:33:21,896
Hand me my bullhorn, will you?

765
00:33:25,768 --> 00:33:28,103
{feedback squeals}

766
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,771
Amelda!

767
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:31,339
Make me a shake!

768
00:33:31,407 --> 00:33:32,407
To go!

769
00:33:32,475 --> 00:33:33,575
AMELDA:
Hooray.

770
00:33:33,643 --> 00:33:35,010
Make it two.

771
00:33:37,813 --> 00:33:39,547
{bell ringing}

772
00:33:39,615 --> 00:33:41,049
{cell phone rings}

773
00:33:44,053 --> 00:33:45,120
Hello.

774
00:33:45,187 --> 00:33:47,455
JESSIE:
Meet me out in the parking lot.

775
00:33:53,729 --> 00:33:56,331
{piano plays gentle melody}

776
00:34:26,095 --> 00:34:28,363
{laughing}

777
00:34:28,431 --> 00:34:29,898
I hear you're a vegan, Berry.

778
00:34:29,965 --> 00:34:31,199
The souls of those
poor egg fetuses

779
00:34:31,267 --> 00:34:32,467
are all on your conscience now.

780
00:34:32,535 --> 00:34:33,301
{laughs}

781
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:35,403
Do it, Jessie.

782
00:34:37,606 --> 00:34:40,382
Are you with us or not?

783
00:34:48,851 --> 00:34:51,052
Do it.

784
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,021
Break it
like you broke my heart.

785
00:34:53,089 --> 00:34:56,150
I loved you.

786
00:35:18,285 --> 00:35:20,453
Now...
nightmares of all of the mothers

787
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,722
of the little baby chicks
coming after me for revenge.

788
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:24,090
Oh, this is bull!

789
00:35:24,157 --> 00:35:26,258
Finn, Mike, Matt, come with me.

790
00:35:26,326 --> 00:35:27,827
Right on. It's time for less
talking and more punching.

791
00:35:27,894 --> 00:35:30,029
Hey, what's going on?

792
00:35:30,097 --> 00:35:31,731
<i>We're on our way to go all
Braveheart on Vocal Adrenaline.</i>

793
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:33,666
Guys, violence is never
the answer.

794
00:35:33,734 --> 00:35:36,102
It is when the question is
"What's the best way to mess up

795
00:35:36,169 --> 00:35:37,103
that Jessie kid's face?!"

796
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,637
Mr. Shue, Rachel's one of us.

797
00:35:38,705 --> 00:35:40,573
We're the only ones
who get to humiliate her.

798
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,208
Stop!

799
00:35:42,275 --> 00:35:44,510
Get back here and sit down!

800
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:48,781
Look, I know from experience

801
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:51,250
that making someone else suffer
doesn't make your pain go away.

802
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:52,852
You're all amazing, no matter

803
00:35:52,919 --> 00:35:54,920
what Vocal Adrenaline
says or does.

804
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:56,756
We just need to find a way
to remind ourselves of that.

805
00:35:56,823 --> 00:35:58,591
We can't just let
Vocal Adrenaline get away

806
00:35:58,658 --> 00:35:59,925
with turning Rachel
into an omelet.

807
00:35:59,993 --> 00:36:01,427
We're not.

808
00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:04,663
Rachel, dial Jessie's
number on your phone.

809
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:10,169
SANTANA: You haven't
deleted his number yet?

810
00:36:10,237 --> 00:36:11,837
Jessie St. James?

811
00:36:11,905 --> 00:36:14,106
Will Schuester here.
You and Vocal Adrenaline need

812
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:17,176
to meet at our auditorium
Friday, 3:00 sharp.

813
00:36:17,244 --> 00:36:19,512
BRETT PAXTON: Let's hear it
from the internationally ranked

814
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:21,914
Cheerios coach Sue Sylvester.

815
00:36:21,982 --> 00:36:24,250
Coach, six consecutive
National titles.

816
00:36:24,317 --> 00:36:26,886
You're the Michael Jordan
of cheerleading.

817
00:36:26,953 --> 00:36:28,254
Thanks, Brett, I am.

818
00:36:28,321 --> 00:36:31,056
Sue, let us know about
the decision you made

819
00:36:31,124 --> 00:36:32,691
to have Kurt Hummel here

820
00:36:32,759 --> 00:36:35,561
do a 14-and-a-half minute
Celine Dion medley,

821
00:36:35,629 --> 00:36:37,897
entirely in French.

822
00:36:37,964 --> 00:36:39,398
Well, I'll tell you what, Brett,

823
00:36:39,466 --> 00:36:40,900
I'm all about finding
a freakish, depressed kid

824
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:42,368
and showing him
what winning is all about.

825
00:36:42,435 --> 00:36:44,203
<i>Vive Le difference!</i>

826
00:36:44,271 --> 00:36:46,205
Whoo! {giggles} Well...
well, Sue, congratulations,

827
00:36:46,273 --> 00:36:49,308
but I have to ask you,
where are you going to put

828
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:51,977
that mammoth
skyscraping trophy?

829
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:54,747
I know just the place.

830
00:36:54,815 --> 00:36:56,382
{doorbell rings}

831
00:37:08,628 --> 00:37:09,662
Get out.

832
00:37:12,032 --> 00:37:13,232
{whispers}:
I'm sorry, Mr. Shue.

833
00:37:15,836 --> 00:37:18,604
Wow. You did it, Sue...

834
00:37:18,672 --> 00:37:20,439
I'll do the talking,
thank you very much.

835
00:37:20,507 --> 00:37:22,508
Let me break it down
for you, William.

836
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:24,844
You're standing at a crossroads.
You have two choices:

837
00:37:24,911 --> 00:37:26,245
Number one:

838
00:37:26,313 --> 00:37:28,581
This trophy will be installed
in the choir room

839
00:37:28,648 --> 00:37:30,316
in a custom-built
bulletproof case

840
00:37:30,383 --> 00:37:32,518
as a daily reminder
of your failure

841
00:37:32,586 --> 00:37:35,354
as a man and an educator.

842
00:37:35,422 --> 00:37:36,555
And what's choice number two?

843
00:37:38,158 --> 00:37:39,391
You can kiss me...

844
00:37:40,827 --> 00:37:43,229
...right here on the lips...

845
00:37:44,664 --> 00:37:46,532
...with tongue.

846
00:37:48,501 --> 00:37:50,169
This is payback, isn't it?

847
00:37:54,975 --> 00:37:56,275
No one will know?

848
00:37:58,245 --> 00:38:01,180
Fine.

849
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:07,887
You know what?

850
00:38:07,954 --> 00:38:09,455
I'm not gonna do this.

851
00:38:10,624 --> 00:38:14,393
Even your breath stinks
of mediocrity.

852
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:16,061
It's making me sick.

Thanks for coming.

After your brazen escalation
of our growing dispute,

866
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,712
which we were willing
to put to rest, we decided

867
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,048
the only way to truly funkify
you is to show you

868
00:39:09,115 --> 00:39:10,416
the one thing
we know you can't do.

869
00:39:10,483 --> 00:39:12,584
