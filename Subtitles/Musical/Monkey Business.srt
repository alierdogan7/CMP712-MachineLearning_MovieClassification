- Sorry to have to report...

4
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,586
there are four stowaways
in the forward hatch.

5
00:01:10,669 --> 00:01:12,963
Stowaways? How do you know
there are four of them?

6
00:01:13,047 --> 00:01:14,548
They were singing Sweet Adeline.

7
00:01:14,631 --> 00:01:16,084
Get them out of there, you hear?

8
00:01:16,168 --> 00:01:17,252
But we can't find them.

9
00:01:17,335 --> 00:01:20,255
And besides,
they've been writing insulting notes.

10
00:01:22,466 --> 00:01:25,467
So, I'm an old goat, am I? Listen to me.

11
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,964
Find them if you have
to clear out that whole hatch!

12
00:01:28,048 --> 00:01:29,132
Yes, sir.

13
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,845
- Captain, when do we get in?
- Wednesday!

I was gonna bring my grandfather,
but there's no room for his beard.

Why not send for the old swine,
let his beard come later?

26
00:02:21,232 --> 00:02:22,901
- I sent for his beard.
- You did?

to stop the boat from rocking?

- What's the matter with me? I'm hungry.

- I didn't eat in three days.
- Three days?

00:08:07,525 --> 00:08:10,694
- We've only been on the boat two days.
- I didn't eat yesterday...

111
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:14,198
I didn't eat today, and I won't eat tomorrow.
That makes three days.

I've got to shiver my timbers.

113
00:08:17,736 --> 00:08:20,489
I got no business.
I come up to see the captain's bridge.

114
00:08:20,572 --> 00:08:23,492
Captain's bridge? I'm sorry.
He always keeps it in a glass...

115

while he's eating.

116
00:08:24,785 --> 00:08:26,822
Would you like to see where he sleeps?

117
00:08:26,905 --> 00:08:28,615
I saw that. That's the bunk.

118
00:08:28,698 --> 00:08:31,243
You're wasting your breath,
and that's no great loss.

119
00:08:31,326 --> 00:08:32,411
A fine sailor you are.

120
00:08:32,494 --> 00:08:36,241
You bet I'm a fine sailor.
You know, my whole family was sailors?

121
00:08:36,324 --> 00:08:39,661
My father was partners with Columbus.
What do you think of that?

122
00:08:39,744 --> 00:08:42,080
- Your father and Columbus were partners?
- You bet.

123
00:08:42,163 --> 00:08:43,706
Columbus has been dead 400 years.

124
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,415
They told me it was my father.

125
00:08:45,498 --> 00:08:49,914
Hop up there, and I'll show you
a few things you don't know about history.

126
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:52,250
Now look. There's Columbus.

127
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,168
That's Columbus Circle.

Would you mind getting up off that flypaper
and giving the flies a chance?

129
00:08:58,749 --> 00:09:02,128
You're crazy. Flies can't read papers.

130
00:09:02,461 --> 00:09:05,917
Now, Columbus sailed from Spain to India
looking for a shortcut.

131
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:08,168
You mean strawberry shortcut.

132
00:09:08,293 --> 00:09:09,795
I don't know.

133
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:12,679
When I woke up,
there was the nurse taking care of me.

134
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:15,555
What's the matter?
Couldn't the nurse take care of herself?

135
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,678
You bet she could,
but I found it out too late. Enough of this.

136
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:19,929
Let's get back to Columbus.

137
00:09:20,012 --> 00:09:22,515
- I'd rather get back to the nurse.
- So would I.

138
00:09:22,598 --> 00:09:24,892
But Columbus was sailing along
on his vessel.

139
00:09:24,975 --> 00:09:27,555
- On his what?
- Not on his what. On his vessel.

140
00:09:27,638 --> 00:09:30,683
- Don't you know what "vessel" is?
- Sure. I can vessel.

[Chico whistling lively tune]

142
00:09:34,645 --> 00:09:37,808
Do you suppose I could buy back
my introduction to you?

143
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:40,519
Now, one night Columbus' sailors
started a mutiny.

144
00:09:40,602 --> 00:09:43,605
No mutinies at night.
They're in the afternoon.

145
00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:46,059
You know, mutinies Wednesdays
and Saturdays.

146
00:09:46,143 --> 00:09:48,729
There's my argument. Restrict immigration.

[Gibson talking indistinctly]

148
00:10:19,488 --> 00:10:20,614
All right.

149
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:25,451
Of all the colossal impudence!

150
00:10:25,534 --> 00:10:28,115
Why don't you stand up?
Can't you see he has no chair?

151
00:10:28,198 --> 00:10:30,117
- Why, you...
- You better keep quiet.

152
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,703
We're a couple of big stockholders
in this company.

153
00:10:32,786 --> 00:10:34,038
Stockholders?

154
00:10:34,204 --> 00:10:36,700
You look like a couple of stowaways to me.

155
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:41,747
Don't forget that the stockholder
of yesteryear is the stowaway of today.

156
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,790
Well, you look exactly like them.

157
00:10:43,874 --> 00:10:45,457
What do they look like?

158
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,413
One of them goes around
with a black moustache.

159
00:10:48,496 --> 00:10:52,131
So do I. If I had my choice,
I'd go around with a little blonde.

160
00:10:52,423 --> 00:10:55,632
I said one goes around
with a black moustache.

161
00:10:56,045 --> 00:10:58,714
You couldn't expect a moustache
to go around by itself.

162
00:10:58,797 --> 00:11:01,383
Don't you think a moustache
ever gets lonely, Captain?

163
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:02,718
CHICO: Sure, it gets lonely.

164
00:11:02,801 --> 00:11:06,423
When my grandfather's beard gets here,
I'd like it to meet your moustache.

165
00:11:06,506 --> 00:11:09,176
I'll think it over.
I'll talk it over with my moustache.

166
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:11,178
Has your grandfather's beard
got any money?

167
00:11:11,261 --> 00:11:14,473
- Money? Why, it fell hair to a fortune.
- Now, listen!

168

too long. Snoop him up.

249

That's better, but the side
that was too short now is too long...

250

in the middle, I think.

on this boat again. The food is no good.

if I don't eat, I like the food good.

one snoop too much.

like I told you.

I'm after Joe Helton, I tell you, and
he can't get away from me on this boat.

He's got to put his okay on my gang,
or he's gonna get this.

if you come in again at 3:00 a. m...

GROUCHO: I can't, can I?

288

That's what they said
to Thomas Edison, mighty inventor...

Thomas Lindbergh, mighty flier,
and Thomas Shefsky, mighty like a rose.

290
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,809
Just remember that if there weren't
any closets, there wouldn't be any hooks...

291
00:21:15,892 --> 00:21:20,313
and if there weren't any hooks, there'd be
no fish, and that would suit me fine.

I know you're in that closet.

- No.

- Am I in the closet now?
- No.

295
00:21:31,943 --> 00:21:36,106
Then how do you know I was in the closet?
Your Honour, I rest my case.

You're not gonna get me off this bed.

I didn't know you were a lawyer.
You're awfully shy for a lawyer.

You bet I'm shy. I'm a shyster lawyer.

300

that would give me...

but dirty breaks.

From the time he got the marriage license,
I've led a dog's life.

I want life, I want laughter, I want gaiety.

Madam, before I get through with you,
you will have a clear case for divorce...

and so will my wife.

320
00:22:44,222 --> 00:22:46,884
The first thing to do is
to arrange for a settlement.

You take the children,
your husband takes the house.

you take the insurance and I take you.

Sir, this is an outrage,
breaking into a man's home.

00:24:01,702 --> 00:24:05,824
There'll be a letter about this in
the Times tomorrow morning.

Yeah?

00:24:19,295 --> 00:24:21,630
has promised to become
the mother of her children.

337
00:24:21,714 --> 00:24:25,214
And with that, sir, I bid you a fond farewell.
Good day, sir.

338
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:27,921
Good day.

339
00:24:31,341 --> 00:24:33,260
Come out of there. I want to talk to you.

340
00:24:33,343 --> 00:24:35,964
I'm sorry, but we're using
the old-fashioned iceman...

341
00:24:36,047 --> 00:24:39,050
and we find him very satisfactory
for keeping the house warm.

342
00:24:43,638 --> 00:24:47,177
Just as I thought, you're yellow,
grabbing at a woman's skirts.

343
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,013
- I'm wise.
- You're wise?

344
00:24:50,096 --> 00:24:51,431
What's the capital of Nebraska?

345
00:24:51,514 --> 00:24:54,142
What's the capital
of the Chase National Bank? Give up?

346
00:24:54,225 --> 00:24:57,513
Now, I'll try you on an easy one.
How many Frenchmen can't be wrong?

347
00:24:57,597 --> 00:24:59,974
- I know...
- You were warm and so was she.

348
00:25:00,057 --> 00:25:03,144
Don't be discouraged.
With a little study you'll go a long way.

349
00:25:03,227 --> 00:25:06,265
- And I'd wish you'd start now.
- Do you see this gat?

350
00:25:06,474 --> 00:25:10,019
Cute, isn't it? Santa Claus bring it
for Christmas? I got a fire engine.

351
00:25:10,102 --> 00:25:12,730
Listen, mug. Do you know who I am?

352
00:25:12,813 --> 00:25:16,602
Don't tell me.
Are you animal or vegetable? Animal.

353
00:25:17,352 --> 00:25:22,065
- Get this. I'm Alky Briggs.
- And I'm the fellow who talks so much.

354
00:25:22,149 --> 00:25:24,901
Fancy meeting you here
after all these drinks.

355
00:25:29,483 --> 00:25:31,359
- Wait a minute.
- Sorry, I can't stay.

356
00:25:31,443 --> 00:25:32,986
The captain's waiting to chase me.

357
00:25:33,069 --> 00:25:36,483
You can stay, all right,
until I finish with you.

358
00:25:36,608 --> 00:25:38,318
Alky, darling, please!

359
00:25:38,401 --> 00:25:41,696
Don't "darling" me.
Get in that next room and stay there!

360
00:25:42,697 --> 00:25:44,783
Get in that next room.

361
00:25:47,361 --> 00:25:49,947
I'm not good enough for her, am I?

362
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,916
Is there anything you've got to say
before I drill you?

363
00:25:55,537 --> 00:25:58,497
- Yes, I'd like to ask you one question.
- Go ahead.

364
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,209
Do you think that girls think less of a boy
if he lets himself be kissed?

365
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:05,333
Don't you think that although
girls go out with boys like me...

366
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:07,415
they always marry the other kind?

367
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:11,628
If you're gonna kill me, hurry up.
I have to take my tonic at 2:00.

368
00:26:11,711 --> 00:26:14,589
I can use a guy with your nerve.

369
00:26:15,709 --> 00:26:18,169
I think we could get along well together.

370
00:26:18,252 --> 00:26:21,214
Of course, the first year we might have
our little squabbles.

371
00:26:21,297 --> 00:26:24,008
But, then, that's inevitable, don't you think?

372
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:30,508
And what do you want here?

373
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:34,053
I was just looking for him.

374
00:26:34,553 --> 00:26:36,006
Do you know this guy?

375
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:39,510
I've known him for years.
He used to live in the next barrel to me.

376
00:26:39,593 --> 00:26:42,888
I see. The stowaways.

377
00:26:43,889 --> 00:26:46,009
I can help you bozos.

378
00:26:46,093 --> 00:26:50,514
- Mr. Bozos to you.
- All right, Mr. Bozo. And you can help me.

379
00:26:51,431 --> 00:26:54,810
I'm shorthanded,
and I want to get a guy on this boat.

380
00:26:54,892 --> 00:26:58,515
It's too late to get him on now.
Should've said so before we sailed.

381
00:26:58,765 --> 00:27:03,228
Listen. This is a map of B Deck.
There's Joe Helton's stateroom.

382
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:08,434
And he's a tough egg.
And you're coming with me...

383
00:27:09,018 --> 00:27:11,437
while I have it out with Joe.

384
00:27:12,647 --> 00:27:14,107
Do you know who Joe Helton is?

385
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,644
I think I'll get off this boat
until this blows over.

386
00:27:16,727 --> 00:27:19,855
If you know what's good for you,
you'll stick with me.

387
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:25,896
You keep the windows covered
while I go in. Now, move!

388
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,700
[Children chattering]

389

[Harpo whistling a soft tune]

393
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:21,905
What is the idea of this?

394
00:29:21,989 --> 00:29:24,366
It's all right. I make a move for you.

395
00:29:24,491 --> 00:29:26,737
MAN 1: This is an outrage!
MAN 2: I'll call the captain!

396
00:29:27,446 --> 00:29:29,615
- The captain don't play chess.
- Purser!

397
00:29:29,698 --> 00:29:32,951
- Steward! Come here.
- Too much noise here for us.

398
00:29:33,035 --> 00:29:35,574
We better go someplace where it's quiet.

399
00:29:37,157 --> 00:29:38,199
[Knock on door]

400
00:29:38,658 --> 00:29:39,701
Come in.

401
00:29:44,955 --> 00:29:46,909
BELLBOY: Your cigars, sir.
JOE: Thanks.

402
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,581
Wait a minute.

403
00:29:56,203 --> 00:29:57,496
Thank you, sir.

404
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:25,298
Dad, now look at you.
You aren't even dressed yet.

405
00:30:25,879 --> 00:30:28,840
You can do all the dressing
for the family, Mary.

406
00:30:28,965 --> 00:30:32,594
Old Joe Helton is taking things easy
for the rest of his life.

407
00:30:33,553 --> 00:30:35,425
We're big shots now, baby.

408
00:30:40,011 --> 00:30:41,095
[Knock on door]

409
00:30:41,179 --> 00:30:42,222
Come in.

410
00:30:45,428 --> 00:30:49,430
- Hello, Joe.
- Hello, Briggs. What do you want?

411
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:52,272
I just wanted to have a friendly talk.

412
00:30:52,814 --> 00:30:55,395
I'm sort of worried about business.

413
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:56,853
Step in the other room, baby.

414
00:30:56,937 --> 00:30:58,897
- But, Dad...
- Run along, honey.

415
00:31:02,192 --> 00:31:03,235
Your kid?

416
00:31:06,272 --> 00:31:07,899
She's cute, isn't she?

417
00:31:08,983 --> 00:31:12,153
I don't think we've got anything
to talk about. Get out.

418
00:31:12,612 --> 00:31:15,153
Not before I get your okay on my gang.

419
00:31:15,236 --> 00:31:18,653
- I'm not doing you any favours.
- Yes, you are.

420
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,989
You're gonna sign this.

421

[Dog barking]

422
00:31:31,158 --> 00:31:35,781
I'm taking over your territory,
or there's gonna be trouble.

423
00:31:35,864 --> 00:31:37,866
I'm taking no sides.

424
00:31:37,991 --> 00:31:41,036
You'll have to fight it out
with Butch and the gang.

425
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:43,872
I'm stepping into your shoes as boss.

426
00:31:43,956 --> 00:31:46,952
I'm not backing up any small-time chiseller.

427
00:31:47,035 --> 00:31:49,371
ALKY: Don't put on the Ritz with me.

428
00:31:49,454 --> 00:31:51,373
JOE: Don't get cocky with me, Briggs.

429
00:31:51,456 --> 00:31:52,707
ALKY: I'm talking turkey.

430
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:56,037
You can't make all the dough
and then run out on your pals.

431
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,831
I'm not taking orders from a mug like you!

432
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:01,668
Scram!

433
00:32:01,751 --> 00:32:04,045
So that's your answer? Here's mine!

434
00:32:04,128 --> 00:32:05,167
[Horn tooting]

435
00:32:13,047 --> 00:32:16,544
So you got your gang with you?
I'll get you later.

436
00:32:19,964 --> 00:32:21,382
Who are you guys?

437
00:32:23,092 --> 00:32:24,843
What are you doing in my room?

438
00:32:24,926 --> 00:32:28,090
That's my partner, but he no speak.
He's dumb and deaf.

[Joe chuckles]

441
00:32:33,226 --> 00:32:37,348
You guys don't know it, but you just scared
a pretty tough egg out of this room.

442
00:32:37,431 --> 00:32:39,141
Sure, we're a couple of tough guys.

443
00:32:39,267 --> 00:32:41,602
- Do you want to make some money?
- Money?

444
00:32:41,686 --> 00:32:43,020
[Chico guffaws]

445
00:32:43,104 --> 00:32:46,767
Money? Feel this muscle. Feel his muscle.

446
00:32:49,603 --> 00:32:51,522
All right. How much you pay?

447
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:53,816
Just how tough are you?

448
00:32:53,899 --> 00:32:55,853
You pay little bit, we're little bit tough.

449
00:32:55,936 --> 00:32:57,479
You pay very much, very much tough.

450
00:32:57,563 --> 00:32:59,314
You pay too much, we're too much tough.

451
00:32:59,398 --> 00:33:01,066
- How much you pay?
- I pay plenty.

452
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:04,236
Then we're plenty tough.
And we show you, too.

453

See? That's nothing. That's free.
Now we give you the real stuff this time.

CHICO: Come on. Put some pep in it.

456
00:33:17,777 --> 00:33:20,488
The one-two uppercut.
You know, on the button.

457
00:33:21,406 --> 00:33:24,991
No downstairs button. Upstairs button.

458
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:35,615
That's fine. That's good, all right.

459
00:33:35,699 --> 00:33:39,034
I tell him you're tough, and you punch
like a lily. What's a matter?

460
00:33:39,118 --> 00:33:42,329
You wanna lose this job?
Give him the stuff this time.

461
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,997
Excuse me, boss. He can do much better...

but he no work good today.

Come on. Hurry up.

470
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:14,846
That's enough. Wait.

471
00:34:15,633 --> 00:34:18,010
- What do you think of us?
- You're great.

472

My grandfather's great.
He's a great-grandfather.

479
00:34:41,811 --> 00:34:44,022
When Helton comes out
of his room, plug him.

480
00:34:44,105 --> 00:34:47,185
- What'll we plug him with?
- Didn't I give you two gats?

481
00:34:47,268 --> 00:34:50,480
We had to drown the gat,
but we saved you a little black gitten.

And keep your eye on that guy
that just went out of here.

You understand.

486

Anybody come near the boss,
let him have it.

You're all right now, boss.

00:35:06,565 --> 00:35:09,777
Anybody comes near you...
What's a matter with you? Look out.

489

That's all right. He was just practicing.

490

Get out.

491
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:17,235
Now I can take a walk out on deck
and feel safe. Come on. Let's go.

492
00:35:26,529 --> 00:35:28,448
There he comes now. Get him.

Don't worry. We'll get him.
I've got my finger on the trigger.

It's the boss. He's got a disguise.

Not afraid, are you?

Afraid? Me?

- Hello. How are things in the closet?

- Don't you think we'd better go?
- What?

511
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:19,989
And leave this woman alone
with her husband?

512

Suppose her sweetheart came in.

cooped up in that stateroom.

- Your turn.

You were going to show me a good time.
A good time!

Of course you would.

by your bodyguards?

- I anticipated that.

How does an army travel? On its stomach.
And you? On a ship.

00:57:42,311 --> 00:57:45,266
Now that you've brought it up,
how long have you been careful?

830
00:57:45,349 --> 00:57:47,976
- They saw us!
- Be calm, Emily. I'll talk to them.

831
00:57:48,059 --> 00:57:49,769
You won't say anything about this?

832
00:57:49,853 --> 00:57:52,522
Sir, are you trying to offer me
a bribe? How much?

833
00:57:52,606 --> 00:57:56,519
But you don't understand.
You see, I'm not happy with my husband.

834
00:57:56,603 --> 00:57:58,730
He should've married some little housewife.

835
00:57:58,813 --> 00:58:01,900
Madam, I resent that.
Some of my best friends are housewives.

836
00:58:03,234 --> 00:58:04,318
[Clears throat]

837
00:58:04,401 --> 00:58:06,022
Now, see here, if you're going to...

838
00:58:06,105 --> 00:58:08,065
You're living in a fool's paradise.

839
00:58:08,149 --> 00:58:11,444
You intend to spend $10 to buy
this woman a ring? Look at this.

840
00:58:11,527 --> 00:58:14,154
It's solid brass and $1.50 takes it away.

841
00:58:14,237 --> 00:58:17,359
I know it'll fit her.
I got it from the nose of a savage.

842
00:58:17,443 --> 00:58:20,571
Well? $1.50. You can have it for $1.

843
00:58:21,322 --> 00:58:23,699
Fifty cents and not a nickel under.

844
00:58:23,782 --> 00:58:27,613
Now, my friends, what am I offered for
this fine French piece of bric-a-brac?

845
00:58:27,696 --> 00:58:29,615
I know what it is to be unhappy.

846
00:58:29,698 --> 00:58:32,117
How do you think I feel?
I'm stuck with this ring.

847
00:58:32,201 --> 00:58:34,949
I've been married for four years,
four years of neglect...

848
00:58:35,032 --> 00:58:37,491
four years of battling,
four years of heartbreaks.

849
00:58:37,574 --> 00:58:40,368
That makes 12 years.
You must've been married in rompers.

850
00:58:40,452 --> 00:58:44,121
Mighty pretty country around there.
Do you think you'll ever go back?

851
00:58:44,205 --> 00:58:45,992
Come here, babe. I like you.

852
00:58:46,075 --> 00:58:48,495
I shouldn't. What about my husband?

853
00:58:48,578 --> 00:58:51,498
That's all right.
Maybe we can get a girl for him.

854
00:58:59,457 --> 00:59:00,958
Who was that? My wife?

855
00:59:01,042 --> 00:59:03,044
Married to her 12 years and you ask me?

856
00:59:03,127 --> 00:59:05,539
What're you doing here?
I told you to spy on Helton.

857
00:59:05,623 --> 00:59:07,333
- I did spy on him.
- What was he doing?

858
00:59:07,416 --> 00:59:09,251
- He was spying on me.
- Did he see you?

859
00:59:09,335 --> 00:59:12,260
No. I was too foxy for him.
All he could do was spy on me.

860
00:59:12,344 --> 00:59:15,050
Well, get back in there.
We're all set to cop his girl.

861
00:59:15,133 --> 00:59:16,549
Okay, chief.

862
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,555
[Girl screaming]

863
00:59:38,933 --> 00:59:41,936
They got some good stuff outside.
You want a drink?

864
00:59:46,433 --> 00:59:49,353
Ready, boys? Let's go.

[Continues playing rhythmic music]

871
01:01:39,142 --> 01:01:42,645
- Very swell. Let me get you some punch.
- I'd love it.

872
01:01:53,357 --> 01:01:55,186
Just what I needed.

873
01:01:59,648 --> 01:02:01,734
[Band playing upbeat music]

874
01:02:09,276 --> 01:02:11,611
Well, how's it coming, kid?

875
01:02:11,695 --> 01:02:14,986
- Got everything you want?
- Sure, how about a job for my grandfather?

876
01:02:15,068 --> 01:02:16,693
JOE: Your grandfather, what does he do?

877
01:02:16,776 --> 01:02:18,486
He puts cheese in the mousetraps.

878
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:20,864
Why, we haven't got any mice here.

879
01:02:20,947 --> 01:02:23,074
He brings his own mice with him.

880
01:02:23,158 --> 01:02:24,407
[Joe laughs]

881
01:02:37,873 --> 01:02:42,044
You know, Mary, everyone seems to be
having nearly as much fun as I am.

882
01:02:42,461 --> 01:02:46,041
I beg your pardon, but there's someone
to see you, Miss Helton.

883
01:02:46,666 --> 01:02:49,627
- Pardon me, and I'll hurry right back.
- Surely.

884
01:02:56,419 --> 01:02:57,503
[Harpo whistles]

885
01:03:09,884 --> 01:03:11,927
No, you're wrong, girls, you're wrong.

886
01:03:12,011 --> 01:03:15,300
In the first place,
Gary Cooper is much taller than I am.

887
01:03:16,008 --> 01:03:19,386
I wish you'd announce this singer.
I can't make out the name.

888
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:21,555
Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to announce...

889
01:03:21,639 --> 01:03:24,763
that the buffet will be served
in the next room in five minutes.

890
01:03:24,846 --> 01:03:26,511
To get you in that room quickly...

891
01:03:26,595 --> 01:03:29,264
Mrs. Schmalhausen will sing a soprano solo
in this room.

892

You wanna get thrown out again?

01:06:04,533 --> 01:06:06,780
Play something nice.
I tell you what you play.

898

Mary, my daughter! Do something!

910
01:08:30,582 --> 01:08:31,917
But who could've done it?

911
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,789
It's that Alky Briggs!
You saw them drag her into the car.

912
01:08:35,955 --> 01:08:38,124
Where did they take her?

913
01:08:38,208 --> 01:08:40,460
First, they blindfolded me and then they...

914
01:08:40,543 --> 01:08:42,587
Of course, they took her to the barn.

915
01:08:42,670 --> 01:08:45,792
Fellows, let's all pack up a lunch
and go down to the old barn.

916
01:08:45,875 --> 01:08:51,089
Fred, you go down to the North Road.
Jack, you head down by Front Street.

917
01:08:51,464 --> 01:08:53,216
I'll go pick up a couple of the boys.

918
01:08:53,299 --> 01:08:55,628
And I'll take care of picking up
a couple of dames.

Nobody will hear you in here.

You wait till my father hears about this!

927
01:09:25,768 --> 01:09:28,854
He's gonna hear about it
because I'm gonna tell him myself.

Listen, kid. Nobody's gonna hurt you.

932

You'll be out in an hour
if your dad comes through.

GROUCHO: Give me $1. I'll keep the change.

939
01:10:18,202 --> 01:10:19,829
That's a half a dollar I owe you.

940
01:10:28,372 --> 01:10:30,874
You call this a barn?
This looks like a stable.

941
01:10:30,958 --> 01:10:33,585
It looks like a barn but smells like a stable.

942
01:10:33,669 --> 01:10:35,914
Well, let's just look at it.

943
01:10:36,081 --> 01:10:38,250
Get out of here!

944

Gosh, the picnic is off,
we haven't got any red ants.

959
01:11:24,854 --> 01:11:27,562
I know an Indian who's got
a couple of Red aunts.

960
01:11:27,729 --> 01:11:30,023
Don't you think we'd better
go look for the girl?

961
01:11:30,106 --> 01:11:32,900
Let's wait till we eat,
there's hardly enough lunch for two.

962
01:11:32,984 --> 01:11:36,480
I don't see why she couldn't get
kidnapped near a restaurant.

963
01:11:36,981 --> 01:11:41,360
Some dark night, I think I'll come and
lay for you if the hens don't get sore.

964
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:43,903
Here.

965
01:11:44,111 --> 01:11:48,152
Go over to that filling station
and get some milk. Grade-A.

966
01:11:50,738 --> 01:11:52,823
Well, come on. Where's the milk?

967
01:11:52,906 --> 01:11:55,278
There's a customer ahead of me.

968

Hey!

969
01:11:59,656 --> 01:12:02,117
- What are you doing here?
- What are we doing?

970
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:05,655
What about you, kidnapping a girl?
Old-fashioned piece of melodrama...

971
01:12:05,739 --> 01:12:08,908
kidnapping a girl!
You've been reading too many dime novels.

972
01:12:09,284 --> 01:12:12,412
Go on. You get him. I'll wait for you outside.

973
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:14,038
Keep out of this loft!

974
01:12:14,245 --> 01:12:17,744
It's better to have loft and lost
than never to have loft at all.

975
01:12:18,661 --> 01:12:20,455
- Nice work.
- Beat it, or I'll throw you out!

976

01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:07,097
So, thought we were afraid?
Thought we were afraid, did you?

979
01:13:12,561 --> 01:13:15,266

it to you guys right!

987
01:13:44,610 --> 01:13:46,150
Come up here, Butch.

988
01:13:53,574 --> 01:13:57,571
Where's all those farmers' daughters
I've been hearing about for years?

989
01:14:03,369 --> 01:14:06,990
Why don't you boys fight over there?
You want to break my glasses?

990
01:14:08,158 --> 01:14:10,035
Come on, folks. Step right up.

991
01:14:10,118 --> 01:14:12,710
Only 10 cents a chance. Attaboy!
Here you are.

992
01:14:12,794 --> 01:14:15,581
Ten cents gets you in
the only game in the stable.

993
01:14:15,665 --> 01:14:18,209
Let's see. Number 16 wins.
And the lucky number.

994
01:14:18,292 --> 01:14:22,004
There you are, young man.
Sorry you didn't get a better one.

995
01:14:23,589 --> 01:14:24,961
CHICO: Here we go!

996
01:14:25,043 --> 01:14:29,463
Let's see what comes up.
Well, if he isn't the lucky guy. Double 0.

997
01:14:29,547 --> 01:14:33,467
Two shots for the price of one.
Folks, this is the best game in all...

998
01:14:35,837 --> 01:14:39,383
You're a mother, you understand.
How would you like to have somebody...

999
01:14:39,466 --> 01:14:42,844
steal one of your heifers?
I know, heifer cow is better than none...

1000
01:14:42,928 --> 01:14:46,132
but this is no time for puns.
Get in that battle over there.

1001
01:14:48,093 --> 01:14:51,888
Here we are again at the ringside,
and it looks like a great battle.

1002
01:14:51,972 --> 01:14:54,389
Now the boys are locked
in the centre of the ring.

1003
01:14:54,472 --> 01:14:57,971
What a grudge fight. Zowie! Zowie! Zowie!

1004
01:14:58,054 --> 01:15:01,057
That makes three zowies,
and a man gets a base on balls.

1005
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:05,097
Ending of the first inning.
No runs, no errors, but plenty of hits.

1006
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:07,223
[Exclaims in mock joy]

1007
01:15:08,933 --> 01:15:12,645
This program comes to you courtesy of
the Golden Goose Furniture Company...

1008
01:15:12,728 --> 01:15:17,017
with three stores: 125th Street, 125th Street
and 125th Street.

1009
01:15:17,101 --> 01:15:19,770
You furnish the girl,
we tar and feather your nest.

1010
01:15:19,854 --> 01:15:22,147
Look for our advertisement
in today's ash can.

1011
01:15:22,231 --> 01:15:25,602
Now the boys are at it
in the centre of the ring! Oh! That one hurt!

1012
01:15:25,686 --> 01:15:30,607
Come on, you palookas! Stop stalling!
Oh, mama, if I only had my youth again.

1013
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:42,153
[Bells clanking]

1014
01:15:42,237 --> 01:15:44,486
Round two.

1015
01:15:47,151 --> 01:15:50,661
Both boys are fiddling in the ring,
and I don't think much of the tune.

1016
01:15:50,744 --> 01:15:52,246
Briggs is bobbing and weaving.

1017
01:15:52,329 --> 01:15:55,951
It's nice work if you can get it.
Now they're trying. Very trying.

1018
01:15:56,034 --> 01:15:57,536
I copped that one from an almanac.

1019
01:15:57,619 --> 01:16:01,165
Now they're in the centre of the ring,
and the crowd hurrahs.

1020
01:16:01,498 --> 01:16:03,125
[Cow mooing]

1021
01:16:16,541 --> 01:16:17,917
Oh, Dad!

1022
01:16:19,169 --> 01:16:21,045
Are you all right, honey?

1023
01:16:21,129 --> 01:16:22,422
[Bells clanking]

1024
01:16:22,589 --> 01:16:26,502
Good boy. Remember, old Joe Helton
never forgot a friend.

1025
01:16:26,586 --> 01:16:29,297
This is one job that certainly
was a pleasure.

1026
01:16:31,132 --> 01:16:34,673
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking for a needle in a hay stack.

1027
01:16:34,922 --> 01:16:35,963
[Upbeat instrumental music]
