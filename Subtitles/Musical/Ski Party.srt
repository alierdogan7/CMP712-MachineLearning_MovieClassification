Why won't you
let me kiss you?

177
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,837
I don't know,
i--i just don't feel like it.

178
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,605
But why? I
mean, look,

179
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,808
i'm a nice,
clean-cut american boy with a c-plus average.

180
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:04,777
Oh, look,

181
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,646
i don't know why.

182
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,648
With you, i just
don't feel it.

183
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,918
You mean, not
like freddie, huh?

184
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:14,787
Oh!

185
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,690
Oh, well,
freddie...

186
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,259
oh, well, freddie.

187
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,697
2,190.

188
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:26,966
Boy, we are a
couple of losers.

189
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,968
We couldn't even
kiss 'em goodnight.

190
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,469
Kiss them
goodnight?

191
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,905
We couldn't even walk them to the front door.

192
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,675
2,191--
i don't get it.

193
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,776
They said
they like us.

194
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,644
I heard
them say it.

195
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:39,845
2,192...

196
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,646
hey,

197
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,283
are you sure you weren't listening to the radio?

198
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,989
2,194.

199
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:52,692
Hey, craig, look
who's coming.

200
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:54,694
Who? Who? Who?

201
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,097
[Man] i promised your housemother

202
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,099
to have you
back before dawn.

203
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,801
Mr. Operator.

204
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,240
[Man moaning]

205
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,979
janet, please!
Let me go.

206
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,948
Leave her alone,
you dirty young man, you!

207
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,249
Yeah!

208
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,553
My lips are
exhausted.

209
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,688
Look, you'll have another date with me

210
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,957
again sometime
soon, i promise.

211
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,959
Before we
graduate, anyway.

212
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,695
Just another 5 minutes.
Please, freddie.

213
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,965
Look, we'll have a whole week in the snow together.

214
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,834
Oh, sure,
with indian

215
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,969
and barbara norris
and linda hughes

216
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,704
and all the
rest of them.

217
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,506
A lot of fun
that'll be.

218
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,012
Oh, freddie, do
we have to go?

219
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,047
Yes! Look, janet,

220
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,715
i am president
of the ski club.

221
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,717
If i'm not there
to see that things

222
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,853
run smoothly,
then who will?

223
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:54,887
Mmm-mmm!

224
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,159
Todd.

225
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,927
Oh, they'll be
back in a week.

226
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,029
Maybe they'll
forget us.

227
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,498
Start packing
warm clothes.

228
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:06,832
You're kidding.

229
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:07,733
I'm not
kidding.

230
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,068
But why?

231
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:10,736
Look, don't argue.
Opportunity is knocking.

232
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,739
Isn't this our first chance to
get involved in a girl-boy sport?

233
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,942
That's not what you're thinking about.
It's the girls.

234
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,744
What girls?
Barbara and linda.

235
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,212
Here we finally
get a 2nd date

236
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,881
with a couple of
beautiful girls.

237
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,749
If they spend a week without us,
in the snow

238
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,918
with freddie, we'll
never see 'em again.

239
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,753
Then what are
we waiting for?

240
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,889
Oh, unless you'd rather hang around here

241
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,591
during mid-term vacation doing push-ups.

242
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,427
You're right.

243
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,761
Oh, uh, uh...

244
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:36,362
todd.

245
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,196
Yeah?

246
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,230
One problem.

247
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,231
What's that?

248
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,367
We don't know
how to ski.

249
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,202
Don't.
Don't know who,

250
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:45,805
don't know how.
Did that stop edison?

251
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,940
Did that stop
alexander graham bell?

252
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:51,043
Oh, well,
as long as those 2 guys are coming.

253
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,979
Just so long as we're not going to be the only 2 there

254
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,114
who don't
know how.

255
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,148
Start packing.

256
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:03,456
Sunshine,
lollipops and rainbows

257
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,258
everything that's
wonderful is what i feel

258
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,594
when we're together

259
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:11,397
brighter than
a lucky penny

260
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:15,000
when you're near,
the rain cloud disappears, dear

261
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,002
and i feel so fine

262
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,805
just to know

274
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,842

so come on,

280
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,326
[All] sunshine,

00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:26,839
and love is here to stay

286
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,178
[all cheering]

287
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,705
oh, todd!

288
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,586
Oh, just smell
that air.

289
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,120
Look at
the snow.

290
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,556
Look at
that blood.

291
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,625
[Whistle blowing]

292
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,997
well, hi
there, gang.

293
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:29,101
Gang, welcome. Welcome
to your ski country

294
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,203
where boys
become men

295
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,271
look on
the steps.

296
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,139
It's a bird.
It's a plane.

297
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,007
It's a creep.

298
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:39,478
Please hurry,
i do not have all day here.

299
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:40,779
We have
several...

300
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:41,714
ah.

301
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,148
Now, in there...

302
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,783
[man screaming]

303
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,452
is the
infirmary...

304
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,621
how'd he figure that out?

305
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,090
Where we have 3
full-time doctors

306
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,726
setting an average of about 9 broken legs a day.

307
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,095
And, uh,
how are they on broken necks?

308
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:57,596
Or
black eyes?

309
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,100
We might
just find out.

310
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:03,802
Now, then,
shall we get to living arrangements?

311
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,571
Oh, i am delighted
to report

312
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:06,772
that i
have received

313
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,974
letters from all the fathers of the boys

314
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:12,011
informing me that chaperones would not be necessary.

315
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,812
I like that.

316
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,982
Unfortunately, i have received no similar letters

317
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,518
from the fathers
of the girls.

318
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,187
Therefore, we shall employ the honor system.

319
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:25,591
Hey, that's great. You trust us and,
in return, we behave.

320
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,192
Just like
west point, right?

321
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,695
Wrong, more
like sing sing.

322
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,664
The boys will be
over here--

323
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:32,798
oh!

324
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,667
To the right
in rooms 205,

325
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,302
206...

326
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,872
[all chattering]

327
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,979
be careful,
this is all very carefully arranged.

328
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:48,047
Here, now.

329
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,317
[Craig] it's a tape.
Mail-order psychoanalysis.

330
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,789
Operation
screwball.

331
00:15:56,822 --> 00:16:00,059
[Man] but there will be 2 of you to a room, and...

332
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,226
uh, uh...

333
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,795
are you sure?

334
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,830
Of course i'm sure.
I've got it all--

335
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:08,233
i mean about my father writing you a letter.
He can't write.

336
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,435
His father
can't write.

337
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:13,072
He only went as far as the 2nd grade,
then he got married.

338
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,074
The--the
2nd grade?

339
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:18,043
To his teacher.
You know her, todd, my mother.

340
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,645
Oh, yeah.

341
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,213
That nice lady i say hello to
every time i go to your house.

342
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,082
Yeah. Her. My mother.
Your mother.

343
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:27,086
[Stuttering] would you wait just a moment, please?

344
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,054
Now, look.
The 2nd grade?

345
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,489
That is utterly
impossible.

346
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:33,258
Oh no, no, it isn't.
He was big for his age.

347
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,760
Yeah, his age.

348
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:36,762
Oh. Uh, uh...

349
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,097
how old was he?

350
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,432
Or--or
shouldn't i ask?

351
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,268
Either 18 or 23.

352
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,537
It's kind of hard to

[Normal voice] do blondes really have more fun?

531
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,604
[Girls laughing]

532
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,008
tallyho, there.

533
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,510
Toodle-oo.

534
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:39,811
Tallyho,
there.

535
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,513
The man here
at the lodge said

536
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,715
the girl's ski class is on slope 6.

537
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,550
And since
we're girls--

538
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:46,751
at least we were the last time we looked.

539
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,354
[Craig] we thought we might just try our hand at it.

540
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:51,756
We're here on a
holiday from school.

541
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:55,727
Just like you chaps or chicks, uh, uh, lassies?

542
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:59,564
I didn't know there were any
english exchange students here.

543
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:03,001
Oh, yes, yes,
we exchanged everything.

544
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:04,703
A long
time ago.

545
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:06,371
[Whispers] at least 10 minutes.

546
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:07,672
Shall we?

547
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:08,607
To the slopes.

548
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,576
[Todd]
be careful.

549
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,544
[Craig]
what for?

550
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:13,578
It feels good.

551
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:16,615
[Yodeling]

552
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,788
that's right,
very good.

553
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,790
Just keep your toes
pointed like this.

554
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:27,192
Good, in
the snowplow.

555
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,760
Good, good,
very nice.

556
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:31,563
[Girl] nita,
could you come over here for a minute?

557
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:32,764
Oh, stay where
you are, jane.

558
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:34,633
I'll be right
back, just stay.

559
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,402
Hey, hey, don't leave
me like this.

560
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:40,605
Where's the brakes
on these darn things?

561
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,441
[Yells]

562
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:45,410
my, your friend's
a fast learner.

563
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:47,145
Look how
nicely she's doing.

564
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:48,780
Good show, todd!

565
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:50,882
Todd?

566
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:53,418
Todd, uh,
jane todd.

567
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:56,421
Todd, t-o-d-d,
one of the oldest families in england.

568
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:58,690
Whoo!

569
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,628
Stretcher bearers!

570
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:06,631
Stiff upper lip, jane!
I'm coming, old girl.

571
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:08,733
But you can't
ski either, nora.

572
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:11,102
Are you serious?
Of course i...

573
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,671
can't.

574
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:14,773
Nita! Nita!

575
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,677
You keep practicing, girls,
i'll be right back.

576
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,112
Oh, yeah,
yeah.

577
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:23,748
Jane got away.
Quick, down there.

578
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:24,783
Why did
she do that?

579
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:27,852
You tell her to get back here right now, linda.

580
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,689
I've got no time
to argue with you.

581
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:32,157
I'll get her.

582
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,296
Wait for me,
dearie.

583
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,216
Nora, you
can't ski.

584
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:00,852
[Todd screams]

585
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,721
whoa!

586
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,356
Oh, craig!

587
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:05,757
Help!

588
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:07,726
Watch out!

589
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:08,693
[Craig screaming]

590
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,980
and i'll never cheat
in exams again.

591
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,815
And when i grow up,

592
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:33,685
i promise never to make a long-distance phone call

593
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:35,053
and charge it to
a wrong number.

594
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:36,287
Whoa!

595
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:37,689
Whoa!

596
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:45,063
Of course,
keeping all these promises won't be easy.

597
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:47,932
But i'll try starting
with the easy ones first.

598
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:50,168
Like, i promise to
brush after every meal.

599
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:51,970
Yes, that's a
good start.

600
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,742
My lips are
getting chapped.

601
00:27:58,877 --> 00:27:59,811
[Screaming]

602
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:36,781
what good is a book like this without pictures?

603
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:46,024
All right!
All right!

604
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:49,327
What's your license number, buddy?

605
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,829
Hey, hey, hey!

606
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:52,931
What's your phone number, honey?

607
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:55,633
Say, how would you like a kick in the mouth?

608
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,002
Great. Play hard to get,
'cause i just love it.

609
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:59,003
You know
something?

610
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,138
No, what's that?

611
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:01,806
That was
a mistake.

612
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,074
[Laughing]

613
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,809
hey, they don't make girls like you anymore.

614
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,578
Oh, i hope not.

615
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:07,846
Ha.
Ha.

616
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:12,517

oh, jane.

621
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,140
[Laughing] must have made a wrong turn.

622
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:37,642
I'll break it.

623
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:39,644
Ha, ha, ha.
Oh, yeah.

624
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:41,045
Come on. I
dare you to.

625
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,648
Nora!

626
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:44,849
For crying out
loud, linda,

627
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,384
will you clear
out of here?

628
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:48,887
Can't you see we
want to be alone?

629
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,655
Nora!

630
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:52,991
Sorry, but he tried
to get fresh with me.

631
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,893
I don't like him
at all, jane.

632
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,060
I don't
blame you.

633
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:57,395
Oh, nora!

634
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:59,898
How can you talk that way about our freddie?

635
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:02,934
Why, all the girls in school just love him.

636
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:06,437
She's right, you know,
every one of them.

637
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:09,307
Come on, baby.
I'll walk you back to the lodge.

638
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:13,011
I say there,
but you really do dig pain, don't you?

639
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:14,512
Oh, nora!

640
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:17,348
Nora, could i speak to you for a moment?

641
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:18,650
Privately?

642
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:20,118
Of course,
my dear.

643
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:23,254
Toodle-oo.

Oh, hey,
are all you english girls like that?

645
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:29,594
[Laughing] oh,
only before we're married.

646
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:32,463
Yeah, what happens
afterward?

647

[organ playing]

650
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,677
looks like i've got to teach you about men, nora.

651
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,579
Men? Ha! I know
all about men.

652
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:49,113
My governess
told me years ago.

653
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,715
The birds
and the bees.

654
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:52,383
The bees jump
on the flowers

655
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,118
and get their
feet all sticky,

656
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,587
then they go to
another flower

657
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,355
and get them
even stickier.

658
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:59,591
Doesn't really sound like very much fun.

659
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,759
Although, i would like to get married someday

660
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:04,629
if the right bee, uh,
boy should come along.

661
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:06,598
Well, then, uh,

662
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:09,934
i don't know how things are done in england,

663
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,136
but, well,
what you just did to freddie

664
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,606
is--is not the way to get and keep a man here.

665
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,075
Oh, tell me more,
linda, please.

666
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:19,477
All right, but raise
your right hand first.

667
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,412
Oh, this is
so exciting.

712
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:14,025

no love to hold

oh, mr. Moon's
hanging low

720
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:49,594
how he shines on
the new fallen snow

721
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:55,099
and that twinkle
of love in your eyes

722
00:33:56,334 --> 00:34:00,071

reindeer really can fly

723
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:04,308

i can't hide

732
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,009

All right,

00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:21,252
What do you think of, uh,

741
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:23,621
I didn't even
know he was sick.

742
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,690

to marry me.

I heard bells.
I swear it. I heard bells.

746
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:35,199
How do you like that?

747
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,235
It's the
sleigh, silly.

748
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:40,505
For a minute there,
i thought you were the avon lady.

749
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,207
I'm beginning
to like you.

750
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,243
What are you gonna
be when you grow up?

751
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:46,844
When i...

752
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:49,647
always putting
me on. All right,

753
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,649
go ahead,
if it makes you feel better.

754
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:53,251
Honestly...

755
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:55,419
do you really
like me?

756
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:56,687
You tell me first.

757
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,256
No, i asked
you first.

758
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:01,058
All right.
I'd marry you tomorrow if i could get a raise.

759
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:02,260
I didn't know
you had a job.

760
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,362
I don't. I meant a
raise in my allowance.

761
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:05,229
Oh.

762
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:06,430
Well,

763
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,699
it's the thought
that counts.

764
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:11,402
I really do like
you, barb. Very much.

765
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,038
We'll see.

766
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:16,607
We'll see? W-what
does that mean?

767
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,042
I don't know.

768
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:20,344
I saw barbara stanwyck say it in a movie once

769
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:22,313
and she wound up
with cary grant.

770
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:24,382
One favor, please.

771
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:25,249
Mmm.

772
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:27,285
Don't be
funnier than me.

773
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:29,086
Can i be prettier?

774
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,621
Yes, but
not funnier.

775
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:33,257
I wouldn't
even try.

776
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:36,294
[Sleigh bells ringing]

777
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:39,463
linda.

778
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:41,299
Linda, i want you to
be my girl. Seriously.

779
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:43,434
I mean, see only me
while we're up here.

780
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:46,470
You mean, like, um,
go steady in the snow?

781
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:47,772
You've got to.

782
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:52,310
Todd, i don't
"got to" do anything.

783
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:56,480
You can't tell a
girl to be your girl.

784
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,750
It has to come
from her. Slowly.

785
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,352
You're too anxious.

786
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,487
Yeah, i guess
you're right.

787
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:04,822
My technique's
nowhere.

788
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:07,124
You even said it that
night at the drive-in.

789
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:08,893
Just be honest.

790
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:10,995
Then linda, what
am i doing wrong?

791
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:12,763
Oh, i know,
everything.

792
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,899
You always answer
your own questions.

793
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:16,567
Why do you
always do that?

794
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:18,903
Then tell me what's the right technique, linda,

795
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,438
to get a girl
to care for you.

796
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:21,906
A girl like you.

797
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:25,576
Oh, todd,
a girl doesn't tell a boy something like that.

798
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:26,344
They don't?

799
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:29,347
No. They might
tell another girl

800
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,882
how to spot a phony
from a real guy.

801
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,785
Oh, sure. Yeah,
sure, sure.

802
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,455
Women are much too competitive to help each other.

803
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:39,423
Oh, no.
That's not true.

804
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:40,925
Why, just
this afternoon,

805
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,928
i was straightening out 2 english
girls about american boys.

806
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:45,329
You were?

807
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:46,931
Yeah, i was going
to tell them more

808
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:48,466
as soon as we get back to the lodge.

809
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,368
I see. Then you'll
probably give them

810
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:52,003
the rest of the
scoop tomorrow, huh?

811
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,871
Well, actually,
i was going to invite them

812
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:55,306
up to our
room for cocoa

813
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,340
after the
sleigh ride,

814
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:58,376
but i don't know
where they live.

815
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,378
Oh, well, uh,
if i see them,

816
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:01,946
i'll, uh,
i'll tell them to drop over.

817
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:04,515
Oh, great. They were
really lots of fun.

818
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:07,418

craig and me?

819

Thank you.

Hey, listen,
speaking of dumb boys,

887
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:56,554
did i tell you about the time i
taught craig gamble a lesson

888
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,789
for arriving late
on our first date?

889
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:02,626
No, but we're just dying to hear,
aren't we, nora?

890
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,727
Just dying.

891
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:08,132
Well, we were parked up on mulholland drive,
in the dark

892
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:10,568
and he decided
he had to kiss me.

893
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:11,569
What did
you say?

894
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,804
[Barbara]
i said no, naturally.

895
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:15,573
Boy, that kinsey
was some liar.

896
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:17,541
What happened?

897
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:20,077
Well, first of all,
he locked all the car doors

898
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,879
and then he
tried to tie my arms

899
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:24,014
behind my back
with my hair ribbon.

900
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,750
So, i
fixed him.

901
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,818
I let him
kiss me.

902
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,587
That's
getting even?

903
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,022
I had a cigarette in my mouth at the time.

and his nose and his chin,
and his eyebrows

906
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:42,733
so, it turned out to be a very passionate kiss.

907
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,769
Oh, you know, boys
are all right.

908

You just have to watch them every minute.
That's all.

Why, just tonight,
todd tried to put his arm around me.

915

916
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:10,594
that is,
if his parole comes through in time.

1062
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:43,820
to suddenly disappear as nora and jane

1063
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:46,189
and, 15 minutes later,
come back as todd and craig.

1064
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:48,792
That's no good.
I'll go, you stay here.

1069
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:58,001

Is she pretty?

[Nita]
she is a lot of fun.

nice personality.

1074
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:08,178
She's a dog.

1075
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:10,013
Well, i'll be back

Listen, when i
come back as me

1077
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:16,720
you don't
know me.

1078
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:20,724
Come on, what do you
think i am? Stupid?

1079
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:26,863
Look, uh, have a
coke or something.

1080
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:29,466
Nothing's going to happen for at least 10 minutes.

1081
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:31,134
[Freddie]
hi, beautiful.

1082
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:33,337
I've been looking
all over for you.

1083
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:36,907
This just isn't
my century.

1084
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:41,178
Have you
been avoiding me?

1085
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:42,846
Like
the plague.

1086
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:45,048
Well, thought you might like to go for a little ride.

1087
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:46,616
Lots of luck!

1088
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:48,251
Oh, ho.

1089
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:50,053
Hot cocoa.
I brought it for you.

1090
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:52,522
Thought you looked in need of a little warming up.

1091
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:55,125
Look, go take your
hot cocoa and...

1092
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,694
oh!

1093
00:49:58,295 --> 00:49:59,563
Oh, thanks.

1094
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:02,632
Ah, good, huh?

1095
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:04,434
Mmm. Yummy.

1096
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:08,271
You know, you're obnoxious,
but you're not dumb.

1097
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:10,073
You do know
something.

1098
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:11,842
I know how to
treat a woman.

1099
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:13,110
Oh?

1100
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:14,878
How's that?

1101
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:17,080
Why don't you just, uh,
climb aboard,

1102
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:19,349
and, uh, maybe
i'll show you.

1103
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:22,252
I think it would be safer for your bluecross rates

1104
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:24,087
if you told
me instead.

1105
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:26,356
Ok, it's a deal.
You first.

1106

00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:47,444
look. Relax, baby,
will you? Huh?

1109
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:49,679
It's just like
driving a car.

1110
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:53,083
Oh!

1112
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:01,091
Oh, i say, this is fun,

1113
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:02,793

There isn't.

1123
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:48,205
Oh, how wonderfully
thrilling it must be

1124
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:51,508
to go hurtling down a steep,
snow-covered ski jump

1125
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:53,643
and then go
flying into midair.

Freddie, don't worry about nora too much.
She'll be all right.

You're right.
I don't even know you that well.

is your own business.

Nothing.

Except no one,

the past 24 hours

out of your room 4 times today.

She's there right now,
isn't she, in your room?

1293
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:16,646
And she went
in at 4:15.

Look, can i help it if todd and i dig european women?

And linda and i
were so nice to them.

1296
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:27,657
Well, what are you
so happy about?

1297
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:29,525
Are you kidding?
You heard barbara.

1298
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:31,494
I'm having a big
scene with myself.

1299
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:32,495
What?

1300
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:33,496
Never mind.

i don't know
why you 2 guys

1303
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:43,373
even bothered to come up here in the first place.

1304
01:00:43,406 --> 01:00:45,742
2 days,
and neither of you has even had the guts

1305
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:46,743
to try on a
pair of skis.

1306
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:47,777
Gin.

1307
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:50,747
We were thinking of going up tomorrow, freddie.

1308
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:53,716
Mmm-hmm.
Well, tomorrow's the club ski-jump championship.

1309
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,019
Oh, too bad. Maybe
the day after, then.

1310
01:00:56,886 --> 01:00:58,921
We're going back
the day after.

1311
01:00:58,955 --> 01:01:00,990
Well, as the dodgers
always say,

1312
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:02,358
"wait till next year."

stones will"--

1315
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:08,898
you could win tomorrow if you wanted to.

1316
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:10,700
Of course,
i could.

1317
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:12,068
I like
winners.

1318
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:15,538
He's never jumped in
his life. He's afraid to.

1319
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:16,939
That is true?

1320
01:01:16,973 --> 01:01:18,574
You're afraid?

1321
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:19,942
Such a waste
of energy.

1322
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:21,944
[Nita]
you jump for me.

1323
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:23,579
[Todd]
but--but--but i...

1324
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:25,948
you win the
championship tomorrow.

1325
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:29,018
You want me to risk my life for a little gold cup?

1326
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:31,754
No, todd, you win
more than the gold cup.

1327
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:35,958
If you win tomorrow,
we play the american game.

1328
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:37,894
Spin the bottle.

1329
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:40,363
Well, what
did you expect?

1330
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:41,798
This is an
american picture.

1331
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:44,033
All right,
i'll jump.

1332
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:45,868
Todd!

1333
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:47,937
That voice sounds
vaguely familiar.

1334
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:49,605
I hate you.

1335
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:55,978
I do hope you win.

1336
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:00,049
Perfect
feminine logic.

1337
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:03,052
"I hate you. I
do hope you win."

1338
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:04,420
That's logical.

1339
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:08,825
We, who are about to watch you die,
salute you.

1340
01:02:12,862 --> 01:02:14,831
Until tomorrow.

1341
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:29,579
Well, what choice
did i have?

1342
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:32,615
I don't know.
We could have stayed home and done pushups.

1343
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:54,904
[Todd]
come on in.

1344
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:05,548
I got it.

1345
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:08,518
It's lucky i remembered the morning weather balloon.

1346

helium was so heavy.

it over here.

got everything?

1353

ready to go.

it'll work?

Can't you just put
a band-aid on it?

1434
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:57,173
I'll come back tomorrow for the splint.

They gave him something and he
went to sleep for about a half hour.

1460
01:09:20,356 --> 01:09:22,591
Then he woke up, got
his milk bottle and left.

1497
01:12:47,262 --> 01:12:49,998
Yeah, like--like you do to the american girls.

1498
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:53,502
I've been watching, and
it looks pretty nice.

1500
01:12:55,637 --> 01:12:57,606
Nita, don't make fun at a time like this.

1501
01:12:57,639 --> 01:13:00,709
I'm not making fun.
I want you to talk to me

1502
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:03,445

after that, we'll.

1508

Then more talk.

1509
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:17,493

hold hands.

No.

1511
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:22,464
Then you ask for the
kiss on the cheek.

1512
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:26,101
And then, maybe,
the kiss on the cheek.

1513

Then...

1514
01:13:28,504 --> 01:13:30,339

One runs away with
an english girl,

1604

and the other one
disappears completely.

1605

01:27:59,807 --> 01:28:01,009
where is she?

1766
01:28:01,042 --> 01:28:01,876
Who?

1767
01:28:01,909 --> 01:28:03,344
Nora, you
idiot.

1768
01:28:03,378 --> 01:28:06,114
Oh, uh, uh,
can you take it, old man?

1769
01:28:06,147 --> 01:28:07,882
Hurry up and tell me before i flip out!

1770
01:28:07,915 --> 01:28:09,183
Where is she?

1771
01:28:09,217 --> 01:28:10,351
Let's have
a talk.

1772
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:12,320
Excuse me for
a second, honey.

1773
01:28:12,353 --> 01:28:13,888
Just for
a second.

1774
01:28:13,921 --> 01:28:15,356
Come on.

1775
01:28:17,358 --> 01:28:19,160
You still haven't
told me a thing.

1776
01:28:19,193 --> 01:28:20,728
Why are we
stopping here?

1777
01:28:21,829 --> 01:28:23,665
Do these
look familiar?

1778
01:28:24,432 --> 01:28:25,366
Nora!

1779
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:28,202
They're nora's.
Where?

1780
01:28:28,569 --> 01:28:30,038
Out there
somewhere.

1781
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:31,973
You see,
when she heard you were coming,

1782
01:28:32,006 --> 01:28:34,208
she started swimming in that direction.

1783
01:28:34,242 --> 01:28:35,977
Right now,
i'd say she was somewhere

1784
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:37,645
between here
and japan.

1785
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:39,580
That's about as
close as i can get.

1786
01:28:39,614 --> 01:28:41,349
Oh, no. Nora!

1787
01:28:42,417 --> 01:28:44,185
Nora! I'm
coming, darling!

1788
01:28:45,753 --> 01:28:47,355
Nora!

1789
01:28:47,388 --> 01:28:49,724
Remember, float on
your back, darling,

1790
01:28:49,757 --> 01:28:51,492
if you get tired.

1791
01:28:51,526 --> 01:28:54,395
If you hurry,
you might catch her somewhere near guam.

1792
01:28:54,429 --> 01:28:57,031
Nora, i'm coming, darling!

1793
01:28:57,565 --> 01:28:59,434
Pretty mean
thing to do, huh?

1794
01:28:59,467 --> 01:29:02,770
Well, don't worry.
We'll tell him the truth tomorrow...

1795
01:29:03,471 --> 01:29:05,606
if he comes back.

1796
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:07,408
Dear doctor lansdorf,

1797
01:29:07,442 --> 01:29:10,611
i--i really feel that
i am getting better.

1798
01:29:11,779 --> 01:29:16,384
Except, doctor,
there are some very strange things happening

1799
01:29:16,417 --> 01:29:18,019
like all of a
sudden, the--

1800
01:29:18,052 --> 01:29:20,254
the skis have
gotten much fatter.

1801
01:29:20,288 --> 01:29:22,457
<i>The d.j.'s are saying that</i>
<i>the snow reports are good</i>

1802
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:25,393
<i>we'll get some alcohol</i>
<i>and put it under my hood</i>

1803
01:29:25,426 --> 01:29:28,563
<i>we're being left alone,</i>
<i>like a ski party should</i>

1804
01:29:28,596 --> 01:29:31,566
<i>we'd stay about a</i>
<i>month if we could</i>

1805
01:29:31,599 --> 01:29:34,435
<i>after skiing all day</i>
<i>and parties at night</i>

1806
01:29:34,469 --> 01:29:37,972
<i>with 5 feet of snow,</i>
<i>what a beautiful sight</i>

1807
01:29:38,005 --> 01:29:40,942
<i>there's plenty of chicks,</i>
<i>enough for everyone</i>

1808
01:29:41,442 --> 01:29:43,945
<i>and even the beginners</i>
<i>will be having fun!</i>

1809
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:07,301
<i>There'll be groovy</i>
<i>little chicks</i>

1810
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:08,903
<i>with sweaters real tight</i>

1811
01:30:08,936 --> 01:30:12,473
<i>just skiing all day</i>
<i>and having parties at night</i>

1812
01:30:12,507 --> 01:30:14,008
<i>we're gonna</i>
<i>ride every lift</i>

1813
01:30:14,041 --> 01:30:15,476
<i>while it's still light</i>

1814
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:17,779
<i>we won't be seeing</i>
<i>the sights</i>

1815
01:30:18,346 --> 01:30:20,281
<i>after skiing all day</i>

1816
01:30:20,314 --> 01:30:21,749
<i>and parties at night</i>

1817
01:30:21,783 --> 01:30:23,017
<i>with 5 feet of snow</i>

1818
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:24,485
<i>what a beautiful sight</i>

1819
01:30:24,519 --> 01:30:27,321
<i>there's plenty of chicks,</i>
<i>enough for everyone</i>

1820
01:30:27,355 --> 01:30:30,491
<i>and even the beginners</i>
<i>will be having fun</i>

1821
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:32,460
<i>let's have a ski party</i>

1822
01:30:33,628 --> 01:30:36,731
<i>let's have a ski party</i>
