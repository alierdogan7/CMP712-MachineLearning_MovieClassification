You're not eating candles.

00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,079
Yeah, but she only had
10 candles last year...

508
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,708
...and the year before that.
Come to think of it...

- It's my birthday.
- But chow mein for breakfast?

515

Why not?
There's an egg roll, isn't there?

...we could've all
bought you presents, Louise.

518
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,775
But it's more fun
to clip from the five-and-dime, anyway.

519
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:51,283
It's a catcher's mitt
and a big-league baseball.

Gee, thanks, Yonkers.

521

but they caught me.

522

Here, I should have wrapped it.
It's a chicken and it plays music.

All right, only one egg roll apiece.

In this act, I saw June singing a song
in, like, a barnyard.

544
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:12,280
And then, a cow came on-stage.

545
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,451
- A cow?
- That's pretty sophisticated.

546
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:19,000
Not a real cow. Sort of a dancing cow
with a great big smile.

That cow...

548
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:24,462
That cow leaned right over my bed
and spoke to me.

549
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,750
What did the cow say?

550
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:29,763
MAN: Mrs. Hovick.
- I am not cooking in here, Mr. Kringelein.

- Now, about that cow. That cow...
MAN: Mrs. Hovick.

555
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:44,977
- That dear talented cow
looked me right in the eye and said:

556
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:49,070
"Rose, if you wanna get back
on the Orpheum Circuit...

557
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:53,739
...you put me in your act."

You're gonna pay that talented cow
and not us.

00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,083
I'm not paying anybody.
I'm taking that cow's advice.

Chowsie, and the monkey. Everybody.

00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,090
- Mother.
- We're paying for it, aren't we?

672
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:54,470
You'll get an ulcer like Herbie. Besides,
what the dogs don't eat, we will.

673
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:57,139
Did it ever occur to you
there might be somebody...

674
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,518
...who doesn't like Chinese food?
- Don't be silly. Who?

675
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:02,977
- You like it, Herbie?
- Of course, I love it.

676
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:04,308
- Oh, did she?
- Yes.

677
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,322
- That's a healthy lady.
- Oh, Lord.

678
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,775
Herbie's angry.
He's chain-smoking.

679
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:12,238
Herbie's never angry.
It's bad for his ulcer.

680
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:15,277
- Come on now, girls, beddy-bye.
- But it's so early.

681
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,833
Baby, tomorrow you're gonna
audition for Mr. T.T. Grantziger...

682
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:21,657
...and his Tivoli Theater.
You gotta look young.

683
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:25,043
- Can I wear a dress?
- Make you look old. You don't own one.

684
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:27,963
- Good night, Uncle Herbie.
- Good night, June.

685
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:33,048
- Good night, Louise.
- Good night, Herbie.

686
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:35,723
I'll cold-cream their faces
and be right back.

687
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:37,759
Rose, the hotel
is just two doors away.

688
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:42,022
Honestly, the way you behave
with those girls. Rose.

689
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:44,897
We need silverware for when we
set up housekeeping.

690
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:48,024
I don't get you. High
and mighty with a suite at the Astor...

691
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:51,193
...and still stealing the cutlery.
- Grasp every opportunity.

692
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,452
Oh, Herbie, how long is it gonna
take you to get used to me?

693
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:56,406
How long
to get used to those coats?

694
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:59,786
What's wrong with the coats? They're
stylish. Louise is very handy.

695
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,414
"An eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth."

696
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:05,372
And it serves them right
for overcharging.

697
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,431
They can skip the cold cream
for one night.

698
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:21,061
All this time,
you still stand up for me.

699
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:23,226
Well, it's instead of
standing up to you.

700
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,234
- Hope the babies'll be all right.
- No matter how you dress them...

701
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,397
...how you smother them,
they're not babies.

702
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,436
- They're almost young women.
- They're not and never will be.

703
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:33,241
I'm embarrassed
in front of them.

704
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:35,736
Why should you be?
You're almost their father.

705
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,907
- When are you going to marry me?
- Don't forget our scrapbooks.

706
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:42,577
- When are you going to quit stalling?
- When we're rolling in dough.

707
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,497
Don't you know
there's a depression?

708
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:45,906
Sure. I read Variety.

to vaudeville?

What the talkies are doing to vaudeville?
Don't you know I love you?

711
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,840
Do you think I'd be unfaithful
to my husbands if you didn't?

712
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,680
- Gotta think of my girls, their happiness.
- Louise is happy...

713
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,600
...being front end of a cow.
- Better than the rear end.

714
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:08,018
- She and June should be in school.
- I promised June the Pantages Circuit.

715
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:11,109
- Honey, could I have a spoon to stir tea?
- Yes, ma'am.

716
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:13,436
I promised I'd get her
on the Orpheum Circuit.

717
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,151
- And I will.
- I will.

718
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,611
You promised me
that after I do you'd marry me.

719
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:20,702
I promised she'd be headliner
at the Tivoli. She's gonna be.

720
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:23,660
- Didn't you hear what I said?
- Yes, but I'm ignoring it.

721
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:26,000
Oh, thanks, honey.

722
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:31,585
Herbie, it isn't very polite of a gentleman
to remind a lady that she welched.

723
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:35,134
- There was no date on that promise.
- You stop handing me that.

- Rose, sometimes I could...
- Herbie, your stomach.

Oh, why on earth
don't you get angry on the outside...

726
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:43,307
...instead of let it settle on the inside?
- I'm afraid.

00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,724
- Of me?
- No, me. Me.

Why?

729
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:53,693
If I ever let loose, it'll end up
with me picking up and walking.

730
00:44:56,361 --> 00:45:00,201
- Only around the block.
- Oh, no.

834
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:46,180
How is it that when we're there
he's here...

835
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,600
...and when we're up here,
he's down there?

836
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:51,769
Mr. Grantziger is a very clever man.

837
00:53:52,605 --> 00:53:54,435
I'll go see if he's down
on that stage.

838
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:57,568
- This the way?
- No. No, Rose. Wait.

839
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:00,356
- We will wait right here.
- Herbie.

840
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:05,531
Look, friend, strictly between us,
if I were you I'd sign that contract.

841
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:09,203
There's only one item in that act
of yours that the boss likes.

842
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:12,503
Dainty little June.
He thinks she can be an actress.

843
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,918
Musical comedy, Broadway,
that sort of stuff.

844
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:17,497
And he's right.
Now, that's great, isn't it, Rose?

845
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:19,963
On one condition.

846
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:22,216
You stay away.

847
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:27,720
- Stay away? I'm her mother.
- You said it, I didn't.

848
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:31,103
- What about the act?
- One week at the Variety.

849
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:33,559
- After that? June is the act.
- Rose...

850
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:36,231
...this has to be private,
not in front of strangers.

851
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,570
- How are Louise and I supposed to live?
- You might get a job, dear.

852
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:45,317
I have a job, dear.
And I do it damn well.

853
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:48,624
Mama, this would be better
than vaudeville for June, and for us.

854
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,447
Nothing is better than vaudeville.

855
00:54:50,663 --> 00:54:53,213
Was. Was better than vaudeville.
Where are your values?

856
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:54,535
Motherhood comes first.

857
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:58,130
Then you ought to see that this is right.
You'll have June on the stage.

858
00:54:58,337 --> 00:55:01,547
I will take care of you and Louise
and we'll live like real people.

859
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:04,127
Rose, this way
we can have our cake and eat it too.

860
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:05,893
Your cake.

861
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:11,925
Besides, June wouldn't start
all over again like some beginner.

862
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:16,192
Ask her, Mama, ask her.

863
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:21,484
Yes. Oh, Mama, yes.
Please say yes.

864
00:55:21,694 --> 00:55:28,204
I want to learn, to work. I'll try so hard
to make you proud of me, Mama.

865
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:31,656
Say yes, Mama.

866
00:55:37,626 --> 00:55:39,416
No.

867
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:44,007
And I am proud of you, baby.
And you don't need lessons any more...

868
00:55:44,216 --> 00:55:46,966
...than you need Mr. Grantziger.
- There isn't a person...

869
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:49,847
...who doesn't need Grantziger.
- Look at this person.

870
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:52,965
- Oh, Rose.
- They're so smart in New York.

871
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,183
New York is the center of everything.

872
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:57,056
New York is the center of New York.

873
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,691
There's a country full of people
who know people...

874
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:02,818
...who know what a mother means to
her daughter. Hicks don't.

875
00:56:03,027 --> 00:56:05,647
Let me tell you.
Grantziger's a hick. He'll get no place.

876
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:07,743
- Do you hear me? Keep still.
- Yes?

877
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:11,368
Don't you dare answer that phone
when I'm yelling at you.

878
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:15,497
- Did you hear?
- They're trying to take my baby.

879
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:18,116
That's what they're trying to do.
Over my dead body.

880
00:56:18,334 --> 00:56:23,004
- Come on, we'll go down and tell him.
WOMAN: Just a minute, Mrs. Hovick.

881
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:27,383
Mrs. Hovick! Mrs. Hovick!

882
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:31,678
Don't worry, kids.

883
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:36,179
I will read her the Declaration
of Independence, believe me.

884
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:40,017
It's not your fault, Herbie,
it's just the way it is.

885
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:44,732
Well, I'm gonna try
to change the way it is. Just you wait.

886
00:56:50,783 --> 00:56:52,703
No.

887
00:56:55,788 --> 00:56:57,908
Mama's just talking angry, June.

888
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:01,825
- She won't really spoil anything.
- Yes, she will.

889
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:07,924
I'll never be anything but baby.
Dainty old Baby June.

890
00:57:08,217 --> 00:57:11,927
Well, aren't you happy that
somebody like Mr. T.T. Grantziger...

891
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:14,469
...thinks you can be a real actress?

892
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:19,885
I would be happy if Mama
would only see what this means to me.

893
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:23,564
I'm going to be awfully unhappy
remembering how I lost this chance.

894
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:25,734
Mama made you a vaudeville star.

895
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:28,493
- And she can do it again.
- Vaudeville is gone, Louise.

896
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:33,737
It's over. The only show business left
is right here, on Broadway.

897
00:57:34,243 --> 00:57:36,243
I wanna learn to be part of it...

898
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,913
...part of this kind of show business.

899
00:57:39,123 --> 00:57:41,793
Oh, you can be anything you want.

900
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,210
You were born for this business.

901
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:47,300
You're a real stage personality.

902
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:50,720
You're really wonderful, Louise.

903
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:53,263
I am? Why?

904
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,510
Because, well, I don't know.

905
00:57:56,765 --> 00:58:01,095
When it comes to the act,
you never worry about yourself...

906
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,851
...only for me.

907
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,360
Well, I don't have any talent.

908
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:06,936
Doesn't really matter.

909
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:10,281
It's just that Mama
would like it better if I did.

910
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:18,999
Your mother isn't feeling well.
I'm gonna take her back to the hotel.

911
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:29,423
Don't worry, kids.
I'll figure something out.

912
00:58:37,598 --> 00:58:40,478
More than ever,
I wish Mama would marry Herbie.

913
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:43,314
And then we could all be together.

914
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:47,652
[SINGING] If Mama was married
We'd live in a house

915
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:51,238
As private as private can be

916
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:54,985
Just Mama, three ducks
Five canaries, a mouse

917
00:58:55,199 --> 00:59:00,199
Two monkeys, one father
Six turtles and me

918
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:03,964
If Mama was married

919
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:09,297
[SINGING] If Mama was married
I'd jump in the air

920
00:59:09,505 --> 00:59:13,005
And give all my toe shoes to you

921
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:16,837
I'd get all these hair ribbons
Out of my hair

922
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:21,394
And once and for all
I'd get Mama out too

923
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:25,523
If Mama was married

924
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:31,531
Mama, get out your white dress

925
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:33,185
You've done it before

926
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,403
Without much success

927
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:38,914
- Mama, Godspeed and God bless
- Mama, Godspeed and God bless

928
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,867
We're not keeping score

929
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:44,158
- What's one more or less?
- What's one more or less?

930
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:46,999
- Oh, Mama, say yes
- Oh, Mama, say yes

931
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:50,999
- And waltz down the aisle while you may
- And waltz down the aisle while you may

932
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:55,053
I'll gladly support you
I'll even escort you

933
00:59:55,259 --> 00:59:58,759
And I'll gladly give you away

934
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:05,271
- Oh, Mama, get married today
- Oh, Mama, get married today

935
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:10,765
If Mama was married
There wouldn't be anymore:

936
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:14,743
"Let me entertain you"

937
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:18,735
- "Let me make you smile"
- "Let me make you smile"

938
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:21,489
"I will do some kicks"

939
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:24,826
"I will do some tricks"

940
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:27,748
Sing out, Louise.

941
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,456
Smile, baby.

942
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:35,257
- Mama, please take our advice
- Mama, please take our advice

943
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:37,125
We aren't the Lunts

944
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:39,394
I'm not Fanny Brice

945
01:00:39,595 --> 01:00:42,845
- Mama, we'll buy you the rice
- Mama, we'll buy you the rice

946
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:44,806
- lf only this once
- lf only this once

947
01:00:45,017 --> 01:00:48,267
- You wouldn't think twice
- You wouldn't think twice

948
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,274
- It could be so nice
- It could be so nice

949
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:55,031
- lf Mama got married to stay
- lf Mama got married to stay

950
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:57,855
- But Mama gets married
- But Mama gets married

951
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:03,201
- And married
- And married

952
01:01:03,452 --> 01:01:07,002
- And never gets carried away
- And never gets carried away

953
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:19,425
- Oh, Mama
- Oh, Mama

954
01:01:19,635 --> 01:01:24,425
- Get married today
- Get married today

955
01:01:28,477 --> 01:01:30,307
ROSE:
How do you like those kids?

956
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:34,230
They knew darn well I'd marry Herbie
at the right time and place.

957
01:01:34,483 --> 01:01:36,653
But 12th Street
sure wasn't what I had in mind.

958
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:39,320
So what if the act
is a little shabby right now?

959
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:43,069
Instead of buying longer costumes,
I'm gonna get shorter boys.

960
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:45,743
And that goes for Tulsa too.

961
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:48,334
All that jigging.

962
01:02:01,677 --> 01:02:03,797
Say, that's pretty fancy footwork,
Tulsa.

963
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:05,722
Why don't you show it
to Mrs. Hovick?

964
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:07,561
It's just fooling around.

965
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:11,595
Oh, well, you started fooling around
about three months ago.

966
01:02:11,812 --> 01:02:14,022
He had to do something
during the layoffs.

967
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:19,031
Oh. I thought you were worried about
the act. The way things are picking up...

968
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:21,526
...I wouldn't be surprised
if you kids got paid.

969
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:25,528
Things are looking so good, I might even
treat you to an ice-cream soda.

970
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:28,116
No, thank you.

971
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,535
It's on me.

972
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:34,328
Baby Ruth? Butterfinger?

973
01:02:34,543 --> 01:02:37,843
Well, Mama doesn't like us
to eat just before a show.

974
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:42,168
We don't always have to do what your
mama likes, do we, Louise?

975
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:47,719
LOUISE:
Herbie?

976
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:54,559
Oh, nothing.

977
01:02:56,690 --> 01:03:01,280
Tulsa, if you and the boys have any
problems, just bring them to me, huh?

978
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:03,152
Sure, Herbie.

979
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,577
You can't blame him for trying
to act like a big shot.

980
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,710
Everybody knows he's just a stooge.

981
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:19,125
He is not.

982
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:21,051
I mean, we all depend on him.

983
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:23,216
I like Herbie. We all do.

984
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:29,009
You didn't tell him, did you? I mean
that you're rehearsing for a team?

985
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:30,852
How did you know I was?

986
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:33,179
I saw you practicing after the matinee.

987
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:34,773
- I was up in the fly.
- Louise!

988
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:39,108
Oh, I wouldn't tell anybody,
Tulsa, honest.

989
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:42,436
I'm very secretive. Just like you.

990
01:03:45,489 --> 01:03:46,449
Look.

991
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,454
See?

992
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:52,159
That's what that means in your palm.

993
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:57,289
And this means
that you make up dreams.

994
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:59,841
Just like me. See?

995
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:04,590
And what do you
make up dreams about, Louise?

996
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,796
Oh...

997
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:10,683
People.

998
01:04:11,223 --> 01:04:12,683
I do that too.

01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:17,848
Yes, but yours are about a partner
for your act.

1000
01:04:18,146 --> 01:04:20,646
Oh, she's gonna be more
than a partner, I hope.

1001
01:04:21,942 --> 01:04:24,322
I mean, I dream.

1002
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:30,315
Well, you know.

1003
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:35,159
What would she
have to be like, Tulsa?

1004
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:37,832
A real wonderful dancer
and a singer, I guess.

1005
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:42,343
Oh, no, I'm gonna do most of that.
I don't mean I'm gonna hog it all...

1006
01:04:42,546 --> 01:04:45,336
...but, well, they always
look at the girl in a dance team.

1007
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:46,839
Especially if she's pretty.

1008
01:04:50,554 --> 01:04:53,644
Makeup could help, and costumes.

1009
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:57,432
I've got the costumes all figured out.
A blue satin tux for me.

With rhinestone lapels?

1011

- You think?
- I'll sew them on.

Okay. Thanks.

Well, you see, I pretend...
Oh, this is a mirror.

Once my clothes were shabby

01:05:23,879 --> 01:05:28,879

So I took a vow

1020
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:31,215
Said, "This bum'll be Beau Brummell"

1021
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:33,968
Now I'm smooth and snappy

1022
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:36,562
Now my tailor's happy

01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:57,201
Got my best vest

Is the girl

1032
01:06:02,834 --> 01:06:05,254
Got my striped tie

Got the time and the place

1035
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,720
And I got rhythm

1036

We'll take this big town for a whirl

And if she'll say

1040
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:29,861
"My darling, I'm yours"

1041
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:33,530
I'll throw away my striped tie

1042
01:06:33,782 --> 01:06:36,622
And my best pressed tweed

I start this step, see.

01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:26,462
And then I build it.

1051
01:07:27,669 --> 01:07:29,839
And now I double it.

1052
01:07:34,509 --> 01:07:37,259
She appears all in white.

1053
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:40,559
I take her hand...

1054
01:07:41,725 --> 01:07:43,725
...and I kiss it...

1055
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:49,864
...and lead her on the floor.

1056
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,916

and bring them back.

Herbie, I don't think
you should call the cops.

1171

It's gotta be against the law
for a 13-year-old to be marrying.

01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:09,133

about her age.

I gotta call the police.

who married a boy...

- How old are they?
- The girl's 13.

1178
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:31,856
The boy is 17, 18.

1179
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:34,859
Well, there's nothing illegal
about that in this state.

1180
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:38,992
It's legal for a girl at 12
and legal for a boy at 16.

1181
01:15:39,202 --> 01:15:42,952
This is pioneer country
and we've never changed the law.

- Well, come on in.

We gotta go.

- The police department.
- I fixed up an act of my own...

- Get moving.
- Don't be sore, Herbie.

01:35:00,612 --> 01:35:02,742
LOUISE: In here, Herbie.
- Rose, look, I didn't know.

1498
01:35:02,989 --> 01:35:06,699
- Loui... Rose, I didn't know, believe me.
- I do, honey.

1499
01:35:06,910 --> 01:35:08,580
Oh, what's the didderence?

1500
01:35:08,787 --> 01:35:11,787
The money is good. It's only two weeks
and maybe by that time...

1501
01:35:11,998 --> 01:35:15,628
...something will turn up. Right?
- Right.

1502
01:35:15,835 --> 01:35:19,505
- Oh, you're a nice girl, Rose. Thank you.
- Well, that's show business.

1503
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:22,974
One good thing,
I bet we get top billing.

1504
01:35:23,843 --> 01:35:27,103
Actually, you see, they had us lost
in the middle, and I thought...

1505
01:35:27,305 --> 01:35:29,425
...last would be better so that it reads:

1506
01:35:29,641 --> 01:35:31,681
"And Rose Louise
and her Hollywood Blonds."

1507
01:35:31,893 --> 01:35:34,943
They're gonna use pictures.
I'm making them put a box around it.

1508
01:35:35,146 --> 01:35:37,056
Forget the box, Herbie,
and the pictures.

1509
01:35:37,273 --> 01:35:39,023
- Mama.
- You don't know what they say.

1510
01:35:39,234 --> 01:35:41,864
But Herbie does.
When a vaudeville act plays burlesque...

1511
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:44,070
...it means it's all washed up.

1512
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:47,870
Herbie, nothing's gonna
turn up for us, is it?

1513
01:35:50,078 --> 01:35:51,078
No.

1514
01:35:54,916 --> 01:35:57,326
I guess it is a pretty rotten act.

1515
01:35:57,627 --> 01:35:59,377
Oh, come on, honey, it's not the act.

1516
01:35:59,587 --> 01:36:03,587
It's like I've been telling you:
Vaudeville is dead, stone-cold dead.

1517
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:06,680
- Well, we sure tried though, didn't we?
- We sure did.

1518
01:36:06,886 --> 01:36:09,096
- Right?
- Right.

1519
01:36:10,306 --> 01:36:12,216
Herbie.

1520
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:15,100
Say, I better get the cues ready.

1521
01:36:15,311 --> 01:36:17,941
Hey, Rose Louise, where's...

1522
01:36:18,356 --> 01:36:21,646
- Where's your music? Your light cues?
- I'll be right with you.

1523
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:24,897
- You Rose Louise?
- Yeah, I'm Rose Louise.

1524
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:28,743
- Oh, Herbie.
- Things are looking up.

1525
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:33,080
Well, I got a show to open,
Rose Louise, so move your butt.

1526
01:36:36,249 --> 01:36:38,579
Now, listen, you little punk.

1527
01:36:39,461 --> 01:36:43,051
For the next two weeks, you're gonna
speak like a Sunday-school teacher.

1528
01:36:43,256 --> 01:36:47,296
You got something in this theater
you probably never saw before: A lady.

1529
01:36:47,552 --> 01:36:49,052
Take a look.

1530
01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:52,965
That is a lady.
And that is also a lady.

1531
01:36:53,808 --> 01:36:56,768
And every girl in this act is a lady,
and don't you forget it.

1532
01:36:56,978 --> 01:36:58,478
Do you understand?

1533
01:36:58,688 --> 01:37:00,188
Yes, sir.

1534
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:06,949
Now, get out there on that stage and
I'll give you the cues when I'm ready.

1535
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:09,202
Yes, sir.

1536
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:16,080
Excuse me, ma'am.

1537
01:37:28,968 --> 01:37:31,638
Oh, sir, won't you
give me your protection?

1538
01:37:31,846 --> 01:37:33,306
I'm a lady too.

1539
01:37:33,515 --> 01:37:36,515
Just let me by, lady,
and there won't be any casualties.

1540
01:37:36,726 --> 01:37:38,136
Say, you're cute.

1541
01:37:38,353 --> 01:37:41,153
How about you and me
going for a ride after the show?

1542
01:37:41,356 --> 01:37:42,516
All my seats are reserved.

1543
01:37:44,150 --> 01:37:45,150
[LAUGHS]

1544
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:48,490
The thing worked. Thanks to you.

1545
01:37:53,201 --> 01:37:56,951
- Well, if you ladies will excuse me...
- We're very busy.

1546
01:37:57,163 --> 01:37:58,793
In my dressing room?

1547
01:37:58,998 --> 01:38:01,958
- In your dress...? Is...?
- You heard me.

1548
01:38:02,168 --> 01:38:04,958
And I don't like sharing it
any more than you do.

1549
01:38:05,171 --> 01:38:08,301
Particularly with a troupe
from the Virgin Islands.

1550
01:38:08,508 --> 01:38:11,218
Now, don't start up on us,
understand?

1551
01:38:11,427 --> 01:38:13,427
We're headliners
from the Orpheum Circuit.

1552
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:15,680
We were booked into this theater
by mistake.

1553
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:17,890
Weren't we all?

1554
01:38:18,434 --> 01:38:21,854
Say, who made that?

1555
01:38:22,063 --> 01:38:24,573
Oh, I did. I make all our costumes.

1556
01:38:25,233 --> 01:38:29,033
My, look at them
ladylike little stitches.

1557
01:38:29,237 --> 01:38:31,567
That miserable broad
who's been making my gowns...

1558
01:38:31,781 --> 01:38:33,241
...must be using a fishhook.

1559
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:35,200
What do you pay her?

1560
01:38:36,286 --> 01:38:38,696
Twenty-five bucks a gown
and I provide the material.

1561
01:38:38,913 --> 01:38:41,003
- Thirty. Thirty.
- She's new in the business.

1562
01:38:41,207 --> 01:38:44,167
- Who are you? Her mother? Thirty.
- Yes.

1563
01:38:45,795 --> 01:38:48,755
- I'll get the material after the matinee.
- It's a deal.

1564
01:38:48,965 --> 01:38:51,215
Louise,
where's your toreador costume?

1565
01:38:51,426 --> 01:38:54,676
Oh, the girls must have it
in the other dressing room with them.

1566
01:38:55,263 --> 01:38:58,433
Heaven knows what else they got
in the dressing room with them.

1567
01:39:00,101 --> 01:39:03,231
From the way that dame walks,
she would've made a good stripper...

1568
01:39:03,438 --> 01:39:05,058
...in her day.

1569
01:39:08,985 --> 01:39:10,395
Tessie.

1570
01:39:10,612 --> 01:39:12,742
Tessie, I'm short a talking woman.

1571
01:39:12,947 --> 01:39:16,157
Tough. T-U-F. Tough.

1572
01:39:16,367 --> 01:39:18,737
The new comic
won't use a chorus girl.

1573
01:39:18,953 --> 01:39:23,293
Then let him use Mazeppa.
Everybody else has.

1574
01:39:26,502 --> 01:39:30,382
Now, you know Mazeppa's got her
gladiator ballet just before his spot.

1575
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:32,880
Let them cut the ballet.
It stinks anyway.

1576
01:39:33,092 --> 01:39:34,972
Be a sport. I'm in a bind.

1577
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:38,760
You're always in a bind
in this flea-bitten trap.

1578
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:41,933
I'm a strip woman, slob.
I don't do no scenes.

1579
01:39:42,143 --> 01:39:43,483
Now, blow.

1580
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:49,016
Have you ever heard of a first-class
strip woman playing scenes?

1581
01:39:49,275 --> 01:39:51,275
Well, you play stock
in a dump like this...

1582
01:39:51,486 --> 01:39:53,486
...I guess you gotta expect
to get insulted.

1583
01:39:53,696 --> 01:39:55,106
The work is steady, isn't it?

1584
01:39:55,323 --> 01:39:57,623
You bring a new star in
for each show, don't you?

1585
01:39:57,825 --> 01:40:00,115
Tessie, it's just a few lines.

1586
01:40:00,328 --> 01:40:02,498
Fat boy, save your bad breath.

1587
01:40:02,747 --> 01:40:04,957
- I'll give you 10 bucks extra.
- No.

1588
01:40:05,249 --> 01:40:07,749
- I can read lines.
- Who are you?

1589
01:40:07,961 --> 01:40:10,801
Rose Louise, of Rose Louise
and her Hollywood Blonds.

1590
01:40:11,005 --> 01:40:13,755
- Just a minute. What kind of lines?
- You in her act?

1591
01:40:13,967 --> 01:40:15,587
- Well, not exactly...
- Shut up.

1592
01:40:15,802 --> 01:40:17,092
- How are your legs?
- Great.

1593
01:40:17,303 --> 01:40:19,813
- And I'll learn her the scenes.
- Okay, 10 bucks.

1594
01:40:20,014 --> 01:40:22,354
- Now...
- It's money, Mama.

1595
01:40:22,558 --> 01:40:25,638
So, what kind of lines is she gonna
be reading out on that stage?

1596
01:40:25,853 --> 01:40:29,233
The same burlesque junk
that's been said since the year 1.

1597
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:32,030
- Well...
- Say, where you been all your life?

1598
01:40:32,235 --> 01:40:33,315
Playing vaudeville.

1599
01:40:33,528 --> 01:40:36,148
Where? In the Louvre?

1600
01:40:36,364 --> 01:40:39,914
You name any town in the United States
and we've played it.

1601
01:40:40,118 --> 01:40:42,948
My grandpa says we've covered
the country like gypsies.

1602
01:40:43,579 --> 01:40:46,289
Well, you may be a gypsy, Rose Louise,
but you're...

1603
01:40:46,499 --> 01:40:49,959
Say, that ain't a bad name
if you ever take up stripping.

1604
01:40:51,337 --> 01:40:52,667
She won't.

1605
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:55,130
No, but you'll let her feed lines
to a comic...

1606
01:40:55,341 --> 01:40:57,131
...for a lousy 10 bucks a week.

1607
01:40:57,343 --> 01:40:58,393
That's training.

1608
01:40:58,594 --> 01:41:01,264
She's gonna be a headliner.
This is only temporary.

1609
01:41:01,472 --> 01:41:04,812
Just as soon as we finish here,
she's going right back to vaudeville.

1610
01:41:05,226 --> 01:41:07,016
I better go talk to Herbie about this.

1611
01:41:07,228 --> 01:41:10,938
We never do anything without
consulting our artists' representative.

1612
01:41:11,357 --> 01:41:14,527
I'd like to consult
your artists' representative.

1613
01:41:14,736 --> 01:41:16,446
That's a man.

1614
01:41:16,654 --> 01:41:18,454
He and Mama are gonna be married.

1615
01:41:18,656 --> 01:41:21,196
She better grab him
or she's dumber than she looks.

1616
01:41:21,409 --> 01:41:23,449
Don't you start calling
my mother dumb.

1617
01:41:23,661 --> 01:41:26,331
She's a lot smarter than any of you.

1618
01:41:27,081 --> 01:41:32,791
Listen, we gotta share a dressing room.
Let's smoke a peace pipe, okay?

1619
01:41:33,713 --> 01:41:34,843
I'm willing.

1620
01:41:35,048 --> 01:41:39,678
I hope so. Sharing a dressing room is like
sleeping together. You don't get along...

1621
01:41:39,886 --> 01:41:42,136
Miss Tura...

1622
01:41:42,388 --> 01:41:47,308
...I'll thank you not to give the boss
any notion that I would ever play scenes.

1623
01:41:47,518 --> 01:41:52,898
And one more disparaging remark
about my ballet...

1624
01:41:53,107 --> 01:41:56,567
...will find this bugle right in your eye.

1625
01:41:56,778 --> 01:41:58,148
Please!

1626
01:42:00,031 --> 01:42:01,741
There's a lady present.

1627
01:42:01,949 --> 01:42:03,119
Where?

1628
01:42:03,326 --> 01:42:06,406
Open your eyes instead of your mouth.

1629
01:42:06,621 --> 01:42:10,871
Gypsy, meet Miss Mazeppa,
Miss Electra.

1630
01:42:11,501 --> 01:42:16,211
Say, you're even younger than I was
when I started stripping.

1631
01:42:16,422 --> 01:42:17,922
Oh, I'm not gonna strip.

1632
01:42:19,592 --> 01:42:22,222
Something wrong with stripping?

1633
01:42:22,762 --> 01:42:25,762
No, I just meant
I don't have any talent.

1634
01:42:25,973 --> 01:42:28,273
You think they have?

1635
01:42:29,477 --> 01:42:32,017
I myself, of course, was a ballerina...

1636
01:42:32,230 --> 01:42:37,280
...but take it from me, to be a stripper,
all you need to have is no talent.

1637
01:42:37,485 --> 01:42:40,275
You'll pardon me...

1638
01:42:40,488 --> 01:42:43,198
...but to have no talent is not enough.

1639
01:42:43,449 --> 01:42:48,249
What you need to have is an idea
that makes your strip special.

1640
01:42:49,622 --> 01:42:51,252
Come here.

1641
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:54,076
Now, sit down here.

1642
01:42:56,295 --> 01:43:00,795
[SINGING] You can pull all the stops out
Till they call the cops out

1643
01:43:01,008 --> 01:43:04,468
Grind till you're fined or you're banned

1644
01:43:04,679 --> 01:43:09,929
But you gotta get a gimmick
If you wanna get a hand

1645
01:43:13,271 --> 01:43:17,481
You can sacrifice your sacro
Working in the back row

1646
01:43:17,692 --> 01:43:20,692
Bump in a dump till you're dead

1647
01:43:21,237 --> 01:43:26,527
Kid, you gotta get a gimmick
If you wanna get ahead

1648
01:43:29,495 --> 01:43:31,285
You can uh
You can uh

1649
01:43:31,497 --> 01:43:33,497
You can uh, uh, uh

1650
01:43:34,250 --> 01:43:37,460
That's how burlesque was born

1651
01:43:37,670 --> 01:43:39,630
So I uh
And I uh

1652
01:43:39,839 --> 01:43:41,719
And I uh, uh, uh

1653
01:43:41,966 --> 01:43:46,216
But I do it with a horn

1654
01:44:15,917 --> 01:44:19,997
Once I was a schlepper
Now I'm Miss Mazeppa

1655
01:44:20,213 --> 01:44:26,343
With my revolution in dance
You gotta have a gimmick

1656
01:44:26,552 --> 01:44:29,642
If you wanna have a chance

1657
01:44:32,433 --> 01:44:34,433
[SINGING] She can mm
She can mm

1658
01:44:34,644 --> 01:44:36,524
She can mm, mm, mm

1659
01:44:37,647 --> 01:44:40,267
They'll never make her rich

1660
01:44:41,067 --> 01:44:43,067
Me, I uh
And I uh

1661
01:44:43,277 --> 01:44:44,987
And I uh, uh, uh

1662
01:44:45,196 --> 01:44:48,946
But I do it with a switch

1663
01:45:00,253 --> 01:45:04,093
I'm electrifying
And I'm not even trying

1664
01:45:04,298 --> 01:45:10,048
I never have to sweat to get paid
'Cause if you got a gimmick

1665
01:45:10,263 --> 01:45:13,433
Gypsy girl, you got it made

1666
01:45:19,689 --> 01:45:21,689
[SINGING] All them mm
And them mm

1667
01:45:21,899 --> 01:45:23,779
And them um, um, um

1668
01:45:24,652 --> 01:45:27,202
Ain't gonna spell success

1669
01:45:27,822 --> 01:45:29,702
Me, I mm
And I mm

1670
01:45:29,907 --> 01:45:31,657
And I mm, mm, mm

1671
01:45:31,867 --> 01:45:35,907
But I do it with finesse

1672
01:45:54,724 --> 01:45:58,564
Dressy Tessie Tura
Is so much more demurer

1673
01:45:58,769 --> 01:46:04,479
Then all them other ladies because
You gotta get a gimmick

1674
01:46:04,692 --> 01:46:08,822
If you wanna get applause

1675
01:46:10,781 --> 01:46:18,041
Do something special
Anything that's fresh will

1676
01:46:18,247 --> 01:46:21,957
Earn you a big fat cigar

1677
01:46:22,168 --> 01:46:25,958
You're more than just a mimic
When you got a gimmick

1678
01:46:26,172 --> 01:46:30,012
Take a look how different we are

1679
01:46:38,225 --> 01:46:41,435
If you wanna make it
Twinkle while you shake it

1680
01:46:41,687 --> 01:46:45,437
If you wanna grind it
Wait till you've refined it

1681
01:46:45,691 --> 01:46:49,441
If you wanna bump it
Bump it with a trumpet

1682
01:46:49,695 --> 01:46:56,865
So get yourself a gimmick
And you too can be a star

1683
01:47:19,934 --> 01:47:21,484
Herbie.

1684
01:47:24,605 --> 01:47:27,565
- Hello, Herbie.
- Hello, Rose.

1685
01:47:29,652 --> 01:47:31,242
You win.

1686
01:47:32,488 --> 01:47:34,488
We've come to the end.

1687
01:47:35,950 --> 01:47:38,740
Guess we'd better
make some new plans.

1688
01:47:39,912 --> 01:47:43,292
Herbie, how about marrying me?

1689
01:47:44,625 --> 01:47:48,545
Sure. Sure. Sure.

1690
01:47:49,213 --> 01:47:50,553
I love you, you know.

1691
01:47:51,132 --> 01:47:53,052
Yeah, I do.

1692
01:47:54,593 --> 01:47:56,553
Let's do it today.

1693
01:47:57,471 --> 01:48:00,601
- Not while we're still in burlesque.
- The day we close.

1694
01:48:00,808 --> 01:48:05,098
It's a deal. Oh, Herbie.

1695
01:48:05,479 --> 01:48:09,649
- I do, I do.
- Oh, so do I, Rose.

1696
01:48:34,758 --> 01:48:36,468
Come in.

1697
01:48:39,013 --> 01:48:44,233
I'll bet you thought I forgot, right?
Not Herbie.

1698
01:48:44,435 --> 01:48:47,185
I remember everything,
including the wedding bouquet...

1699
01:48:47,396 --> 01:48:49,516
...the finest in Wichita.

1700
01:48:50,024 --> 01:48:51,824
Thanks, Herbie.

1701
01:48:52,109 --> 01:48:57,489
- They're knockouts. Aren't they?
- They sure are knockouts, Herbie.

1702
01:48:59,116 --> 01:49:02,826
Hey, hey, hey,
stop packing and talk to me!

1703
01:49:03,871 --> 01:49:07,831
- Oh, gosh, this is the great day.
- Shh, shh.

1704
01:49:08,834 --> 01:49:10,964
I can't help it. I'm nervous.
Why aren't you?

1705
01:49:11,170 --> 01:49:13,840
- I've never been so nervous.
- You've never been married.

1706
01:49:14,048 --> 01:49:17,298
You've never been married before
like you're gonna be this time.

1707
01:49:17,510 --> 01:49:21,050
She's a little sad too.
You know, about the girls.

1708
01:49:21,263 --> 01:49:23,353
Oh, Rose, honey,
I know what you're feeling.

1709
01:49:23,557 --> 01:49:27,437
It ain't easy to give this up after
all these years, but you'll never regret it.

1710
01:49:27,645 --> 01:49:31,355
I ought to shut up, but I can't help it.
I'm getting everything I wanted.

1711
01:49:31,565 --> 01:49:35,025
Including a fancy ceremony
and bridesmaids.

1712
01:49:35,236 --> 01:49:38,606
What the minister's gonna say when he
gets a load of that blond hair...

1713
01:49:38,864 --> 01:49:41,074
...I don't know. I don't know.

1714
01:49:41,283 --> 01:49:44,493
Let's hope he's colorblind.
What difference does it make?

1715
01:49:44,954 --> 01:49:50,674
All he has to ask in exactly one hour is,
"Do you, Rose, take him, Herbie?"

1716
01:49:50,876 --> 01:49:55,586
And you know what I'm gonna answer?
"I, Rose, take you, Herbie."

1717
01:49:55,839 --> 01:49:56,839
HERBIE:
Thank you.

1718
01:49:57,341 --> 01:49:59,011
Thank you.

1719
01:50:01,136 --> 01:50:02,886
I better get these bags in the car.

1720
01:50:03,097 --> 01:50:04,887
CIGAR: I don't know why I stay
in this business.

1721
01:50:05,099 --> 01:50:06,889
If it ain't one headache it's another.

1722
01:50:07,101 --> 01:50:10,061
PASTEY: Shh! They'll hear you out front.
CIGAR: It's my theater. Let them.

1723
01:50:10,271 --> 01:50:13,151
Last week no talking woman,
the week before no second banana.

1724
01:50:13,399 --> 01:50:16,479
You knew that broad wasn't gonna
be here. Why did you start?

1725
01:50:16,694 --> 01:50:18,744
PASTEY:
She don't go on till next to closing.

1726
01:50:18,946 --> 01:50:22,446
- She was only going to the drugstore.
CIGAR: What did they arrest her for?

1727
01:50:22,658 --> 01:50:24,488
PASTEY: Shoplifting.
CIGAR: Cut the spot.

1728
01:50:24,702 --> 01:50:27,542
Do you think we can invite
the minister for a drink afterwards?

1729
01:50:27,746 --> 01:50:31,366
PASTEY: It's the star strip.
CIGAR: Cut it!

1730
01:50:33,127 --> 01:50:36,297
You know, Mama, we could hang
the cow's head over the mantelpiece.

1731
01:50:36,505 --> 01:50:38,875
PASTEY:
They'll yell murder if it's the same bags.

1732
01:50:39,091 --> 01:50:40,051
Mama?

1733
01:50:40,259 --> 01:50:43,389
- The star's the novelty.
- Pastey, what do you expect me to do?

1734
01:50:43,596 --> 01:50:46,136
- Let you strip?
- No.

1735
01:50:47,683 --> 01:50:48,773
My daughter can do it.

1736
01:50:48,976 --> 01:50:50,306
- What?
- Rose Louise.

1737
01:50:50,519 --> 01:50:53,309
- Since when?
- Since she's seen how little there is to it.

1738
01:50:53,522 --> 01:50:56,522
- She didn't look bad in them scenes.
- She'll look great.

1739
01:50:56,734 --> 01:50:57,784
What's the gimmick?

1740
01:50:57,985 --> 01:51:00,775
She's young.
And you got any better ideas?

1741
01:51:00,988 --> 01:51:03,448
- She'd better get ready now.
- It's the star spot.

1742
01:51:03,657 --> 01:51:05,617
- That means star salary.
- If we keep her.

1743
01:51:05,826 --> 01:51:07,906
You will. She's gonna be wonderful.

1744
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:11,620
I knew something would turn up.
Where's that dress for Tessie?

1745
01:51:11,832 --> 01:51:14,502
It'll work perfect for you.
Well, get into your makeup.

1746
01:51:14,710 --> 01:51:16,750
There isn't much time.

1747
01:51:20,299 --> 01:51:23,429
Silly, you aren't really gonna strip.

1748
01:51:23,636 --> 01:51:27,306
All you're gonna do is walk around
the stage in time to the music...

1749
01:51:27,514 --> 01:51:30,524
...and drop a shoulder strap.
You're a lady, like Herbie says.

1750
01:51:30,726 --> 01:51:34,686
You'll just parade so grand they'll think
it's a favor if you show them your knee.

1751
01:51:34,897 --> 01:51:37,187
Louise, it's the star spot.

1752
01:51:37,399 --> 01:51:39,359
I promised my daughter
we'd be a star.

1753
01:51:39,568 --> 01:51:42,988
Not like this. You can't do it, Rose.

1754
01:51:43,197 --> 01:51:46,157
Herbie, it's all right to walk out
when they want you.

1755
01:51:46,367 --> 01:51:49,617
But we can't walk out when
after all these years we're still a flop.

1756
01:51:49,828 --> 01:51:53,118
That's quitting. We can't quit
because we're still a flop.

1757
01:51:53,332 --> 01:51:55,962
Do this, then we can
walk away proud because we made it.

1758
01:51:56,168 --> 01:52:00,918
Maybe only in burlesque, second-rate
burlesque at that, but please...

1759
01:52:01,757 --> 01:52:03,217
...let's walk away a star.

1760
01:52:19,566 --> 01:52:21,606
Baby.

1761
01:52:24,571 --> 01:52:28,371
No time to finish that dress.
I'll get everything ready.

1762
01:52:28,575 --> 01:52:32,325
Get this junk off this dress,
the Tessie trim.

1763
01:52:32,996 --> 01:52:35,246
Herbie, see what the house is like.

1764
01:52:35,791 --> 01:52:39,171
Sure. Oh, sure, why not?

1765
01:52:40,212 --> 01:52:43,172
ROSE: Didn't I always tell you
you were born lucky, Louise?

1766
01:52:44,007 --> 01:52:46,587
Not too much makeup, baby.
Young and girlish, pure.

1767
01:52:46,802 --> 01:52:49,892
Don't smear that junk all over your face
the way the others do.

1768
01:52:50,097 --> 01:52:52,557
Now, you leave your mouth
the way the Lord made it.

1769
01:52:52,766 --> 01:52:54,556
Not too much rouge. No beauty marks.

1770
01:52:54,768 --> 01:52:58,898
You'll be a lady, grand, elegant,
with a classy, ladylike walk.

1771
01:52:59,106 --> 01:53:02,226
Ye gods, shoes!
Oh, we can use the black ones.

1772
01:53:02,443 --> 01:53:04,243
The old ones
we borrowed from Tessie.

1773
01:53:04,445 --> 01:53:07,905
Put them on, they'll have to do.
If they're big, stuff them with paper.

1774
01:53:08,115 --> 01:53:11,235
Your hair's all wrong.
You can't just let it hang like spaghetti.

1775
01:53:11,452 --> 01:53:14,872
Get it up, dear, get it up.
Puff it out on top. It's gotta be classy.

1776
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:17,710
Thank God the Lord gave us good color
and you washed it.

1777
01:53:17,916 --> 01:53:20,206
Do you think we should use
a couple of feathers?

1778
01:53:20,419 --> 01:53:22,589
No, no, no, that's what they all do.
Jewelry.

1779
01:53:22,796 --> 01:53:25,416
No, no, let Tessie
and the others wear all this vulgar junk.

1780
01:53:25,632 --> 01:53:26,632
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

1781
01:53:26,842 --> 01:53:27,932
- Come in.
- She almost ready?

1782
01:53:28,135 --> 01:53:29,545
She goes on in seven minutes.

1783
01:53:29,762 --> 01:53:32,012
She'll be there. Come on.
Louise, over here.

1784
01:53:32,222 --> 01:53:34,102
Get in the dress.
Come here. Come on.

1785
01:53:34,308 --> 01:53:38,598
You're gonna be wonderful tonight.
Just wonderful, darling. Go along, dear.

1786
01:53:38,812 --> 01:53:41,442
Say, here's your dress.
Keep a lot of pins in your hair.

1787
01:53:41,648 --> 01:53:45,278
Get it tight so it won't fall down.
Will you get out of here?

1788
01:53:45,486 --> 01:53:48,356
- Six and a half minutes.
- I know, I know.

1789
01:53:49,364 --> 01:53:51,494
Say, whose are these?

1790
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:55,290
Oh, my wedding present from Tessie.
Good for a lady. She can wear them.

1791
01:53:55,496 --> 01:53:58,286
Now what else? Oh, music. Music.

1792
01:54:00,667 --> 01:54:04,417
Spanish. Military. Cow.

1793
01:54:07,216 --> 01:54:09,256
Maybe she can do
"Let Me Entertain You."

1794
01:54:09,468 --> 01:54:12,138
Baby, you can do the
"Let Me Entertain You" number.

1795
01:54:12,346 --> 01:54:15,006
I'll mark it for the conductor.
You repeat two choruses.

1796
01:54:15,224 --> 01:54:17,814
No, two and a half.
And sing out, Louise.

1797
01:54:18,018 --> 01:54:21,308
Just walk and dip.
Remember, you're a lady.

1798
01:54:21,522 --> 01:54:24,022
Make them beg for more
and then don't give it to them.

1799
01:54:24,233 --> 01:54:25,483
Anything else? Have I...

1800
01:54:25,859 --> 01:54:28,689
...forgotten anything? Oh, is that you?
How's the audience?

1801
01:54:28,904 --> 01:54:33,244
It don't matter.
The car is outside and the girls are in it.

1802
01:54:33,659 --> 01:54:37,039
I'm just gonna put these bags
in the car and then we're going.

1803
01:54:37,246 --> 01:54:40,206
You, Louise and me,
we're gonna get married.

1804
01:54:40,415 --> 01:54:43,625
- This is our farewell to show business.
- Herbie, don't talk dumb.

1805
01:54:43,836 --> 01:54:46,126
Louise plays two performances,
we get dollars.

1806
01:54:46,338 --> 01:54:48,128
She'll always remember
she was a star.

1807
01:54:48,340 --> 01:54:52,300
You want your daughter to take her
clothes off in front of hooting savages?

1808
01:54:52,511 --> 01:54:55,011
You want her to be leered at,
is that what you want?

1809
01:54:55,222 --> 01:54:58,682
On-stage there's an invisible wall
between her and the audience.

1810
01:54:58,892 --> 01:55:00,062
She's an artist.

1811
01:55:00,269 --> 01:55:03,229
An artist has a way of keeping her
audience away and smiling.

1812
01:55:03,438 --> 01:55:05,858
Now, listen,
I'm getting sick to my stomach again.

1813
01:55:06,066 --> 01:55:08,356
Herbie, don't you see
that I have to do this?

1814
01:55:08,569 --> 01:55:11,279
No, I don't see
that you have to do this.

1815
01:55:11,947 --> 01:55:14,447
All I see is what I have to do.

1816
01:55:14,741 --> 01:55:16,531
