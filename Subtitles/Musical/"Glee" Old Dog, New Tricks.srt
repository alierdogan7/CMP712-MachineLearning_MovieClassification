<i>So here's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

2
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:03,453
<i>Rachel's a hit in</i> Funny Girl
<i>on Broadway,</i>

3
00:00:03,487 --> 00:00:05,488
<i>but she's on thin ice</i>
<i>because she lied to producers</i>

4
00:00:05,522 --> 00:00:06,956
<i>and missed a performance.</i>

5
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,390
<i>Mercedes is finishing her album</i>
<i>with a duet with Santana</i>

6
00:00:09,393 --> 00:00:11,527

<i>by a rich society dame</i>

7
00:00:11,562 --> 00:00:12,962

<i>his talent.</i>

8
00:00:12,996 --> 00:00:14,864
I'm a little jealous,
but I'm not resentful.

9
00:00:14,898 --> 00:00:17,033
<i>And all Kurt's got is NYADA</i>
<i>and the diner</i>

10
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:18,468

<i>of neckerchiefs.</i>

11
00:00:18,502 --> 00:00:20,203
<i>And that's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

12
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,925
KURT: Hey, do any of you guys
want to catch a matinee tomorrow?

13
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:28,928
I have a late shift at the diner
and I know<i> Funny Girl</i> is dark.

14
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,830
SANTANA: Uh, "dark" as in
there are no performances,

15
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,665
or "dark" as in it's
kind of a downer.

16
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,867
RACHEL: Oh, my word. I'm
sorry, I-I would love to go,

17
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:36,935
but June's got me taken up with
dinners and rehearsals...

18
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:40,072
Yeah, I know. Count me out.
I'm gonna be at recording studio all day.

00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:42,340
This is terrible... look what I
just found on Broadwaybuzzard.com.

34
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,539

You can't expect total strangers
to know exactly who you are.

38
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,449
I mean, look at Angelina
Jolie... she used to be

39
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,885
that girl with the vial of blood
around her neck

40

who liked kissing her brother,
and now she's mother earth.

41
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:30,956
How'd she do it?

42
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,759
Two things...
publicist and a cause.

43
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,861
BLAINE: She can't afford a publicist.
And<i> I've</i> always been my cause.

KURT: Inside voice, honey.
Sorry.

If there's one thing
I know about,

48
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:42,768
it's cultivating an image.
In high school,

49
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:45,203
I was a huge bitch,
but also most popular.

50
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,339

I would seriously think that
zipping a Seeing Eye dog

in your bag would hinder it
from doing its job.

57
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:05,891
You know, there are so many dogs
out there that need good homes,

58

they were abandoned, abused...

are, really. We try to get as many

130

of them adopted as we can, but
when we can't, not much choice.

it's the worst part of my job.

Broadway revival of<i> Funny Girl.</i>

138

SANTANA: I've got it.
I have got the perfect plan

208
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,928
for how to get this thing
off the ground.

209
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,397
Later today,
you are going to take

210
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,532
a couple of dogs
for a walk around the block,

211
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,901
where paparazzi will be
conveniently waiting.

212
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,669
You're gonna get snapped,
give a quote,

213
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,505
bam, Broadway Bitches
is off and running.

214
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,006
And I also snagged you

215
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,108
this designer number
by a designer that is so fancy,

216
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:05,711
I can't even pronounce his name.
There's hardly any vowels in it.

217
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,546
And if you wear it and
get photographed in it,

218
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,427
you get to keep it for free. But how
do we know that they'll be there?

219
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,583
I made a couple of calls

220
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:12,985
and I tweeted from your account,

221
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,887
and I used hashtag living,

222
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,356
so everyone sees it.
Oh, perfect.

223
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,091
RACHEL: Oh, my God, Kurt!
I have the best news

224
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,492
that I've been wanting
to tell you about.

225
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,661
Is Liza off her meds, running
around Central Park again?

226
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:25,130
I'm starting
a dog-rescue charity!

227
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,499
And Santana and Mercedes and I
are doing a performance.

228
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:28,534
It's gonna be great.

229
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,203
Oh, could I perform, too?

230
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,639
I-I've been itching to do
something outside of school.

231
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:34,973
One Three Hill's
been on a hiatus

232
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,508
ever since Elliot went
to his yoga retreat

233
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,583
and Dani's Roller Derby team
became state champions.

234
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,846
I-I... I think we're
just gonna keep it us girls.

235
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,681
We don't want the event
to be, like...

236
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:44,049
Amateur open mic night?

237
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,951
No, no, no, Kurt.

238
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,619
This is not personal, okay?

239
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:49,488
This is about Rachel
and her image.

240
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:50,923
And you are so good

241
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,192
that you would just be
pulling focus from her.

242
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,327
No, I-I get it.
I get that I haven't exactly

243
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:58,063
made a name for myself like
the rest of you have, but...

244
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,465
gosh, you'd just think
after everything,

245
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:01,200
someone would
throw<i> me</i> a bone for once.

246
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,102
Kurt, wait.

247
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,440
(man coughing in distance)

248
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:11,577
MAGGIE (in distance):
All right, boys, I don't want...

249
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,612
(continues indistinctly)

250
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:18,417
MAGGIE:
I'll leave the window unlocked.

251
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:23,655
That strange boy may come
looking for his shadow.

252
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,325
Oh, Pillsbury, you made it!

253
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,060
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

254
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,995
Sit down.

255
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,565
Take in the magic!

256
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:40,205
MAN: Debbie, it's your...
it's your cue.

257
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,709
Debbie! Rule number one:
hearing aids on

258
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,278
during rehearsal!

259
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:55,354
Uh-oh.

260
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,524
Peter's dead, folks.

261
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,405
MAGGIE: Of all times
she chooses to die,

262
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:10,875
less than a week away
from opening night.

263
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,111
Oh, she was always so selfish.

264
00:11:13,145 --> 00:11:14,779
MARTY:
We have to cancel.

265
00:11:14,814 --> 00:11:18,116
Debbie was the only one
with hips strong enough

266
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,951
f-for the harness.

267
00:11:19,985 --> 00:11:23,655
Take a walk down
the halls here.

268
00:11:23,689 --> 00:11:25,757
Room after room of beds

269
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,693
filled with people who won't
get out of them anymore.

270
00:11:28,727 --> 00:11:30,628
Not because they can't

271
00:11:30,663 --> 00:11:33,364
but because they can't find
any reason to.

272
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,966
This show,

273
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,768
uh, getting up in front

274
00:11:36,802 --> 00:11:39,103
of an audience...
this was my reason.

275
00:11:41,507 --> 00:11:44,075
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

276
00:11:44,109 --> 00:11:46,744
Wh-Wh... uh, when is
opening night?

277
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:48,513
Uh, Monday
at 4:00 p.m.

278
00:11:48,547 --> 00:11:50,547
Incidentally,
that's also closing night.

279
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:52,851
I-I could fill in,
unless there's a rule

280
00:11:52,885 --> 00:11:54,619
about residents only
being in the show.

281
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:57,489
First of all,
we only have two rules.

282
00:11:57,523 --> 00:11:59,424
One, remember your teeth.

283
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,526
And your teeth.

284
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,528
And... don't mix up

285
00:12:03,562 --> 00:12:05,029
your night pills

286
00:12:05,064 --> 00:12:06,998
with your day pills.
It's simple.

287
00:12:07,032 --> 00:12:09,000
I thought I was a pterodactyl.

288
00:12:09,034 --> 00:12:12,137
Are you sure, Pillsbury?

289
00:12:12,171 --> 00:12:14,639
Peter Pan is a very vocally

290
00:12:14,673 --> 00:12:16,674
demanding role for a woman.

291
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:18,943
Can you handle it?
Oh, yeah.

292
00:12:18,978 --> 00:12:20,211
I-I'm a countertenor,

293
00:12:20,246 --> 00:12:21,679
and I practically have the score
memorized.

294
00:12:21,714 --> 00:12:23,782
I was obsessed with my tape

295
00:12:23,816 --> 00:12:25,283
of Mary Martin's version
when I was a kid.

296
00:12:25,317 --> 00:12:26,551
She was my childhood hero.

297
00:12:26,585 --> 00:12:28,653
Which explains a lot
now that I think about it.

298
00:12:28,687 --> 00:12:30,188
We have a piano.

299
00:12:30,222 --> 00:12:33,658
Uh, could you audition
with any music or anything?

300
00:12:33,692 --> 00:12:36,394
You know, we just
can't hand you a part.

301
00:12:36,428 --> 00:12:38,897
We have standards. Right?

302
00:12:38,931 --> 00:12:41,099
I-I do. I always carry

303
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:42,834
sheet music with me
just in case.

304
00:12:42,868 --> 00:12:44,936
Oh. Oh.
Oh.

00:15:41,747 --> 00:15:43,081
Grr. (sputters) (growls, barks)

345
00:15:43,115 --> 00:15:44,849
(growls) We're working
on his impressions.

346
00:15:44,884 --> 00:15:45,850
It's like watching

347
00:15:45,885 --> 00:15:47,385
Goofy teach tricks to Pluto.

348
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,540
(chuckles) Mercedes is gonna
freak when she gets home.

349
00:15:49,555 --> 00:15:51,022
Hush. She's gonna fall
in love with him,

350
00:15:51,057 --> 00:15:53,491
just like I did. You have to
help me sell it to her so she,

351
00:15:53,526 --> 00:15:55,627
like, thinks he's really awesome
when she gets here, okay?

352
00:15:55,661 --> 00:15:58,096
ARTIE:
Don't worry. I got your back.

353
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,098
Sam? Did you
go back

354
00:16:00,132 --> 00:16:01,199
and adopt that dog?

355
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:03,201
Uh... uh, hey.
I tried to stop him.

356
00:16:03,235 --> 00:16:04,502
Uh, baby, yeah.

357
00:16:04,537 --> 00:16:06,171
Sorry I didn't, uh, talk
to you about it first.

358
00:16:06,205 --> 00:16:07,439
It's just that when I saw

359
00:16:07,473 --> 00:16:09,107
McConaughey in his cage,
something inside me just clicked

360
00:16:09,141 --> 00:16:10,575
and I knew that we were meant
for each other.

361
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:11,876
I blame Sarah McLachlan.

362
00:16:11,911 --> 00:16:14,079
I don't mean to be patronizing,

363
00:16:14,113 --> 00:16:17,282
but we have a kitchen full
of dead Chia Pets

364
00:16:17,316 --> 00:16:18,383
that you can't take care of.

365
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:21,186
This is a living,
breathing creature.

366
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,620
So is Artie,
and I take care of him.

367
00:16:22,621 --> 00:16:23,702
Hold up. Did you just...

368
00:16:23,723 --> 00:16:25,023
Look, hey, look, I know

369
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:26,758
I can take care of him, okay?
I just...

370
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:28,153
Give me a chance.
Look, look, look.

371
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,462
(a la Matthew McConaughey):
Oh, McConaughey loves you.

372
00:16:30,496 --> 00:16:32,997
He lo... (baby talk):
Oh, oh, look at the face.

373
00:16:33,032 --> 00:16:35,900
- The pooch. He d... The face.
- Okay. Fine.

374
00:16:35,935 --> 00:16:40,372
If it's that important to you,
we will try it.

375
00:16:40,406 --> 00:16:41,973
Okay. She's gone. Let's go.

376
00:16:42,007 --> 00:16:44,242
- Did you pay the gas bill?
- Yeah.

377
00:16:44,276 --> 00:16:46,778
Uh, no.
Uh, I've...

378
00:16:46,812 --> 00:16:49,381
Artie was just
into this video game.

379
00:16:49,415 --> 00:16:51,983
Did you take out the recycling?

380
00:16:52,018 --> 00:16:54,586
Um, Artie was gonna do it
on his way out.

381
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,954
Am I still here? Am I invisible?

382
00:16:57,523 --> 00:16:59,290
Hold up.

383
00:16:59,325 --> 00:17:01,092
Is that my faux-huahua?

384
00:17:01,127 --> 00:17:02,160
Uh...

385
00:17:02,194 --> 00:17:04,329
(snaps)

386
00:17:06,132 --> 00:17:07,832
Oh, I did that.

387
00:17:07,867 --> 00:17:09,787
Okay, you better
clean this mess up.

388
00:17:09,802 --> 00:17:11,469
Okay, just because
McConaughey is cute,

389
00:17:11,504 --> 00:17:13,505
it doesn't mean...

390
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:21,579
Oh, no.

391
00:17:21,614 --> 00:17:22,854
Oh, I know

392
00:17:22,882 --> 00:17:24,282
that that dog
is not eating my hair.

393
00:17:24,283 --> 00:17:26,017
I<i> know</i>

394
00:17:26,052 --> 00:17:28,586
that you did not let that dog
near my bedroom or my wardrobe

395
00:17:28,621 --> 00:17:30,622
or my makeup!

396
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,027
(Mercedes gasps)

397
00:17:36,062 --> 00:17:37,662
I got to go. Um...
Sam!

398
00:17:37,697 --> 00:17:39,297
Can one of you guys
bring me Don't.

399
00:17:39,331 --> 00:17:40,632
Down the stairs? Don't you even speak.
Don't you even look

400
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,033
I got you. like you're
about to speak to me.

401
00:17:42,068 --> 00:17:43,802
You just pack up that dog
and you take him back

402
00:17:43,836 --> 00:17:45,937
where you got him
or, so help me,

403
00:17:45,972 --> 00:17:47,872
I will go full-on Carcosa
on you.

404
00:17:49,675 --> 00:17:50,809
(exhales)

405
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,683
RACHEL:
Easy.

406
00:17:58,718 --> 00:18:01,686
Okay.

407
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:08,769
Oh, my God, is
that Rachel Berry,

408
00:18:08,794 --> 00:18:10,729
star of Broadway's
smash-hit musical

409
00:18:10,763 --> 00:18:12,831
<i>Funny Girl?</i> ARTIE: I love her!

410
00:18:12,865 --> 00:18:15,400
I saw<i> Funny Girl</i>

411
00:18:15,434 --> 00:18:18,370
five times!
She is just so likeable!

412
00:18:18,404 --> 00:18:19,738
RACHEL:
Oh! (chuckles)

413
00:18:19,772 --> 00:18:21,539
Ms. Berry,
what on earth are you doing

414
00:18:21,574 --> 00:18:22,941
walking all these
beautiful dogs?

415
00:18:22,975 --> 00:18:24,409
Well, someone has to.

416
00:18:24,443 --> 00:18:26,211
Did you know
that New York City shelters

417
00:18:26,245 --> 00:18:28,613
are the most overpopulated
in the state?

418
00:18:28,648 --> 00:18:31,883
What? No, I didn't know that.
That's such a shame.

419
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:35,353
That's why I'm starting
my own dog rescue charity,

420
00:18:35,388 --> 00:18:37,856
Broadway Bitches.

421
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,890
(chuckles)

422
00:18:38,924 --> 00:18:40,892
Okay. Wait,
just stay right there.

423
00:18:40,926 --> 00:18:43,194
(chuckles)
At the, uh, Spotlight Diner.

424
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:45,263
(Rachel chuckling)

425
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,934
(dogs barking)

426
00:18:49,969 --> 00:18:51,002
Okay.

427
00:18:51,037 --> 00:18:52,437
Oh, my God. Stay.

428
00:18:52,471 --> 00:18:54,339
Oh, my God.

429
00:18:55,608 --> 00:18:57,442
Oh, my God. Ah!

430
00:18:58,411 --> 00:19:00,945
(shouting)

431
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:04,322
Oh, my God.

432
00:19:15,971 --> 00:19:19,018
At least you're wearing underwear.
I got dragged four blocks

433
00:19:19,053 --> 00:19:20,620
and now I have to
pay for this dress

434
00:19:20,654 --> 00:19:22,155
and that man got
bit by a shih tzu.

435
00:19:22,189 --> 00:19:23,289
Seriously, is this a good idea?

436
00:19:23,323 --> 00:19:24,763
Because I feel like
I look worse now.

437
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:26,826
No. Yes, this is
a good idea, okay?

438
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,961
Um, everybody's talking
about your activism.

439
00:19:28,996 --> 00:19:31,631
And, in fact, out of the 500
Broadway Bitches Evites

440
00:19:31,665 --> 00:19:34,567
that I sent out this morning,
over half are confirmed.

441
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:37,236
And I even have a reporter
from NYTheatreNews.com ready

442
00:19:37,271 --> 00:19:38,671
to do a piece on it.

443
00:19:38,706 --> 00:19:40,573
So just stick to the plan

444
00:19:40,607 --> 00:19:42,575
and don't go soft on me.

445
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:45,511
Guys, I got good news.
I landed a role.

446
00:19:45,546 --> 00:19:47,480
RACHEL:
"The Lexington Home

447

448
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:50,583
And I'm Peter!

449
00:19:50,617 --> 00:19:51,617
They needed an
emergency replacement

450
00:19:51,652 --> 00:19:52,952
because the woman

451
00:19:52,986 --> 00:19:55,960
playing him dropped... out.

452
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,227
Possibly be serious.

453
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:00,898
I am, actually,
and I'm very excited about it.

454
00:20:00,932 --> 00:20:03,667
Opening night is Monday,
and I'd love to have you.

455
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,336
No, sorry, can't make it.

456
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,605
As much as I would love
to watch Homocchio

457
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,873
and the Geriatric Puppets
put on a depressing

458
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:13,310
sub-community theatre show,
Rachel's event is that night.

459
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,845
Well, that shouldn't be
a problem

460
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:16,313
because the show starts at 4:00.

461
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:19,383
I'm sorry, Kurt. Santana has
me doing all these photo ops

462
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:21,919
and interviews, and my
reputation is at stake here.

463
00:20:21,953 --> 00:20:23,887
Seriously, you know,
I could lose jobs

464
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,356
if I don't clean this up.

465
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,959
I bend over backwards for you
every time you need something.

466
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:32,263
Well, I need you now
so please support me in this.

467
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:35,633
I am doing something good
for the animals.

468
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,034
No, you're doing it
for yourself.

469
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:39,436
You treat me exactly like
the world treats those dogs...

470
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,105
you just cast me aside.

471
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:42,339
Well, I'm done being a friend

472
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,220
only when it's convenient
for you.

473
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:48,989
SAM: Mercedes doesn't want me
to get rid of the dog, okay?

474
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,781
She just wants him
to stop tearing everything up.

475
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,183
ARTIE: You seriously think
you can train that dog?

476
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,119
I had to teach you
how to use Velcro.

477
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,655
Okay, yeah, well, Velcro's hard.
It's like black magic.

478
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:01,358
But, look, I can do this, okay?
Doggies crave discipline.

479
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:04,562
We'll just run him through
the Doggy Gauntlet of Doom...

480
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,564
it's a working title,
don't judge me...

481
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,233
and then once Mercedes gets home
tonight, he'll be groomed,

482
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:11,235
trained and ready
to melt her heart

483
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:14,605
with those big, beautiful puppy
dog eyes that he gets from me.

484
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:17,007
- Let's do it.
- All right, good.

Boys, I've returned
to Neverland!

525
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:26,871
GUS: Maggie, you're supposed
to be on the ground.

526
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:30,007
Peter, we killed a giant bird
while you were gone.

527
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,979
If I get down,
I'm not getting back up.

528
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:36,714
Oh, we look ridiculous!

529
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,382
What were we thinking when

530
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,750
we chose to do<i> Peter Pan?</i>

531
00:23:39,784 --> 00:23:41,418
Well, we wanted
to show our families

532
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,154
that we were still
energetic and young.

533
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,355
Right, Freddie?

534
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,323
(snoring)

535
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,859
But you guys<i> are</i> still
energetic and young.

536
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,729
You know, if you want to seem
young, you got to feel young.

537
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,130
I don't know about all of that.

538
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,299
I was thinking
of changing up the music.

539
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,667
You know, maybe updating it
a little bit.

540
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:58,269
I still think that we should do

541
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,938
<i>The Importance</i>
<i>of Being Earnest.</i>

542
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:03,541
Ever since you were a question
on<i> Jeopardy!,</i>

543
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,676
you have been
such a know-it-all.

544
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,879
Maggie, flowers came for you.

545
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,181
Oh.

546
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,953
Oh, they're from
my daughter, Clara!

547
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:19,089
She's a defense
attorney. "Mom,

548
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,493
"sorry I have
to miss opening night.

549
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:24,929
I have to be in Reno
for a deposition."

550
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:29,834
Oh.

551
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:33,270
She is so thoughtful.

552
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,539
She spoils me.

553
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,477
Oh, that's too bad.

554
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,912
I know how important
Clara is to her.

555
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,614
She talks about her constantly.

556
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,008
All about their lunches, and
their late night phone calls,

557
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,218
and their double dates.

558
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,220
Except none of it's real.

559
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,122
Those flowers aren't
from her daughter.

560
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,957
Maggie sends herself flowers

561
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,959
once a week
to keep up appearances.

562
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,461
Clara hasn't been here in years.

563
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,434
(door closes,
Sam muttering gibberish)

564
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,239
You are shredding my last nerve.

565
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,741
Before you say anything else,
you should know

566
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:13,344
that Artie and I tamed the beast
that is McConaughey.

567
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:14,545
He's not barking,

568
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,881
he's been off his leash
for the last few hours,

569
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,783
but didn't poop anywhere
he wasn't supposed to,

570
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,985
and he didn't eat any
of your weird, strange,

571
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,987
Indian hair.

572
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:26,123
All of that is great,

573
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:27,992
Sam, but we talked about this,

574
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,728
and we both agreed,
we can't take care of a dog.

575
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:31,996
Really? Because
it looks like

576
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,764
I'm doing a pretty good
job of it right now.

577
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,332
For the moment.

578
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,669
But what's gonna happen when
you have, like, a 20-hour shoot,

579
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,772
and you can't walk McConaughey,
or-or put out his food?

580
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:44,341
I don't know. I thought
maybe you could help.

581
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:48,112
Well, I would, and I could, but
what happens when I go on tour?

582
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:51,282
Uh, we could get a dog-sitter.
I don't know.

583
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:52,483
Who's gonna call the sitter?

584
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:55,052
Who's gonna make sure
that they have a key to get in?

585
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:56,520
Who's gonna pay them?

586
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,389
I am, and you know what else
I've been thinking about?

587
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:00,424
You going on tour, and me
being in this brownstone,

588
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:03,160
all alone
and wanting some company.

589
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:04,628
(panting)

590
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,430
You know, last time I checked,

591
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:08,265
New York's a pretty lonely town.

592
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,934
Is that what
this is really about?

593
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:11,936
Maybe.

594
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,804
Partly, yes.

595
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,039
But if we're being honest,

596
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,373
I think it's also about

597
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,275
when I suggested
we take McConaughey home,

598
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,078
you couldn't even imagine me
being able to take care of him,

599
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:22,993
okay, and that's just...
that's just crap, okay.

600
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,249
It's like you're looking at me
like I'm a boy and not a man.

601
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:27,418
- Sam...
- Look, I took care of

602
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:29,019
my whole family
when they had nothing, okay.

603
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:30,988
When they were as poor
and as homeless as McConaughey.

604
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:32,189
I made sure they ate,

605
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:33,691
I made sure
they had a roof over their head,

606
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:34,885
I made sure my little brother

607
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,093
and sister got
to school on time.

608
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:37,294
Me, Sam, the slacker.

609
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:38,796
- Oh, Sam, I... I know.
- But, yeah, yeah, yeah.

610
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,165
I know... I know
that I forget about

611
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,533
appointments sometimes,

612
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,402
and I leave my clothes
around the apartment,

613
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,903
and I get distracted
playing video games,

614
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,371
but that doesn't mean
I'm a joke.

615
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:49,707
I never called you a joke.

616
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,376
Mercedes, look, I...
I want to marry you eventually,

617
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:54,612
when we're ready, and I
want to have a family

618
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:55,846
with a house and a yard
and kids and stuff,

619
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:57,381
but that's only gonna happen

620
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:59,417
if you start taking me
seriously, and that starts with

621
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,753
me proving to you that I can
take care of McConaughey.

622
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:06,924
You-you did, and, uh, I'm giving
you your props for that.

623
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,826
Okay, great.
But I...

624
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,395
I still don't think
that you should keep him.

625
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,530
Why not?

626
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:13,864
(sighs)

627
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:15,366
Because it's not good for him,

628
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,234
Sam. Like I said, I'm about

629
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:19,036
to go on tour, and you...

630
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:21,806
your schedule's crazy,
and it's just gonna get worse.

631
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,742
So, what's the point
of having a dog, even one

632
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:26,377
as cute as McConaughey,
if you can't

633
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:29,580
take care of him,
and you can't enjoy him?

634
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:31,749
(sighs)

635
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:33,951
You heard
what they do to the pets

636
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,387
that you bring back
to the shelters, right?

637
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:40,691
Well, then, you're gonna have
to find a home for him.

638
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:42,259
And I promise you, some day,

639
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:44,328
we're gonna have
everything that you want.

640
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:45,963
Okay, and that includes a dog.

641
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,566
But we're still figuring
things out between you and me,

642
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,968
like who we are together
and where we're gonna be.

643
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,471
I just don't think

644
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,140
that we should drag McConaughey
into that, do you?

645
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:14,701
WOMAN:
Liz, send in my 10:00.

646
00:28:18,673 --> 00:28:21,809
Hi. Um, I'm Kurt Hummel.

647
00:28:21,843 --> 00:28:24,278
Um, I-I didn't
actually cause

648
00:28:24,312 --> 00:28:26,380
a major chemical spill
in National Park.

649
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:28,582
Uh, your receptionist said
that you were really busy,

650
00:28:28,616 --> 00:28:32,352
and that was the only way that I
could make an appointment, so...

651
00:28:32,387 --> 00:28:34,054
Oh. Uh...

652
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:35,222
Liz, call security.

653
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:37,057
Well...
They should only need one guy.

654
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:38,659
No. It's-it's about your mother.

655
00:28:38,693 --> 00:28:40,093
I'm-I'm friends with her.

656
00:28:40,128 --> 00:28:44,698
Wait. Is this some kind of
Martha Raye-Mark Harris thing?

657
00:28:44,732 --> 00:28:46,733
'Cause she doesn't
have any money.

658
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:49,937
No, no. We're performing
together at the home.

659
00:28:49,971 --> 00:28:51,038
Uh,<i> Peter Pan.</i>

660
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,906
Uh, she's Wendy, I'm Peter.

661
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:56,076
Okay. Weird, but whatever.

662
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:58,912
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but the minute the show's over,

663
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:00,914
she's gonna lose your number.

664
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:02,549
(laughs) I...

665
00:29:02,584 --> 00:29:05,085
I don't know what happened
between you two, but, uh,

666
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,288
I can't imagine a sweet old lady
like that hurting anyone.

667
00:29:08,323 --> 00:29:10,657
Well...

668
00:29:10,692 --> 00:29:12,760
she wasn't always
a sweet old lady.

669
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:15,796
She was young and ambitious and

670
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,030
so hungry to get back
in the game,

671
00:29:17,065 --> 00:29:18,426
she tended
to forget little things,

672
00:29:18,433 --> 00:29:22,436
like her daughter at school
and birthdays.

673
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:26,940
And I bet
that was very painful,

674
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:30,310
but your mother is 86 years old.

675
00:29:30,345 --> 00:29:33,380
I mean, don't you want
to forgive before it's too late?

676
00:29:33,414 --> 00:29:35,382
Oh, I've forgiven.

677
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:37,718
Wasn't her fault.

678
00:29:37,752 --> 00:29:40,354
She never should have become
a mother in the first place.

679
00:29:40,388 --> 00:29:43,090
Did you know that she sends
herself flowers from you,

680
00:29:43,124 --> 00:29:44,825
and that she talks about you
constantly?

681
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:47,728
I know all about the scar
on your elbow from the time

682
00:29:47,762 --> 00:29:50,330
that you climbed on the counter
trying to get the box

683
00:29:50,365 --> 00:29:52,900
of Frosted Flakes, nd your
fear of balloons, and that

684
00:29:52,934 --> 00:29:54,101
you aced the SAT.

685
00:29:54,135 --> 00:29:56,103
Wow.

686
00:29:56,137 --> 00:29:57,704
Did she also tell you

687
00:29:57,739 --> 00:29:59,973
that she missed
my high school graduation?

688
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:03,811
She had a dream,
and she got lost in it.

689
00:30:05,713 --> 00:30:08,849
But she is clearly
full of regret.

690
00:30:18,326 --> 00:30:21,061
My mom died when I was eight,

691
00:30:21,096 --> 00:30:24,698
and I spent my entire life
pretending that I had one.

692
00:30:24,732 --> 00:30:27,868
Whatever she did to you,
yours is still here.

693
00:30:29,404 --> 00:30:33,818
Don't you see that by coming
to see her perform

694
00:30:33,853 --> 00:30:36,187
for taking her away from you
that you could heal all of this?

695
00:30:36,222 --> 00:30:37,822
(sighs)

696
00:30:37,857 --> 00:30:40,125
Well, your mother
couldn't take care of you

697
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,695
when you were little, but
you could take care of her now.

698
00:30:45,364 --> 00:30:47,365
(sighs)

699
00:30:49,935 --> 00:30:53,538
(horn honks,
dogs barking and whining)

700
00:30:55,265 --> 00:30:57,585
RACHEL: Oh, this is better than
I could have ever imagined!

701
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,778
I mean, a dozen dogs
have already been adopted,

702
00:30:59,812 --> 00:31:01,680
and we just started! Hi.

703
00:31:01,714 --> 00:31:03,715
Okay, um, Beverly Stevens
from NYTheatreNews.com

704
00:31:03,749 --> 00:31:05,450
is going to be
here later today,

705
00:31:05,484 --> 00:31:07,252
and I've picked out
the perfect pooch

706
00:31:07,286 --> 00:31:09,354
for you to pose with.

707
00:31:09,388 --> 00:31:11,089
He's a three-legged dog!

708
00:31:11,123 --> 00:31:12,524
Oh. Come here.

709
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:14,859
Who doesn't love a lady
holding a three-legged dog?

710
00:31:14,894 --> 00:31:16,928
You know, it's like
a ticket to Heaven.

711
00:31:16,962 --> 00:31:18,463
Oh, Santana,
you're really good at this.

712
00:31:18,497 --> 00:31:20,131
Have you ever thought about
doing this professionally?

713
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:23,234
Sure enough,
every time I watch<i> Scandal.</i>

714
00:31:24,637 --> 00:31:26,604
Okay, come on, Sam.

715
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:30,008
We have to turn McConaughey
into the doggie rescue.

716
00:31:30,042 --> 00:31:32,010
No way, Jose.

717
00:31:32,044 --> 00:31:33,978
Guys, I think we have an issue.

718
00:31:34,013 --> 00:31:35,146
RACHEL: I'm going to
have to take the dog.

719
00:31:35,181 --> 00:31:36,314
You're telling me
I can't take this dog?

720
00:31:36,349 --> 00:31:37,509
Just, I need to take the dog.

721
00:31:37,516 --> 00:31:38,783
No, I can't believe that!
No, no, no, no, no.

722
00:31:38,818 --> 00:31:40,318
WOMAN: No. RACHEL: Yeah,
'cause I have to take

723
00:31:40,353 --> 00:31:42,120
a photo with that dog
later, so...

724
00:31:42,154 --> 00:31:43,621
But this is the dog
my son wants to adopt.

725
00:31:43,656 --> 00:31:45,323
Isn't that the whole point
of this event?

726
00:31:45,358 --> 00:31:46,958
Um, well, maybe you could just
wait a couple of hours?

727
00:31:46,993 --> 00:31:50,328
I have to catch a train back
to Long Island in 20 minutes.

728
00:31:50,363 --> 00:31:51,730
Okay, I'm so sorry, lady,

729
00:31:51,764 --> 00:31:53,531
but hand over the tripod,
and nobody'll get hurt.

730
00:31:53,566 --> 00:31:55,467
I'm sorry...
I can't...

731
00:31:55,501 --> 00:31:57,469
I get it.

732
00:31:57,503 --> 00:32:00,171
I know who you are.
I read the Broadway blogs.

733
00:32:00,206 --> 00:32:02,674
You can't redeem a lie
with more lies.

734
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:05,643
You may get away
with this farce this time,

735
00:32:05,678 --> 00:32:07,979
but you're a fraud, and
it's gonna come out soon enough.

736
00:32:08,014 --> 00:32:10,782
You don't care
about these dogs.

737
00:32:10,816 --> 00:32:14,819
I doubt you care much
about anyone but yourself.

738
00:32:14,854 --> 00:32:16,855
Come on, honey, let's go home.

739
00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:20,859
Don't listen to her.

740
00:32:20,893 --> 00:32:22,427
Look at...

741
00:32:22,461 --> 00:32:24,062
Look at her shoes.

742
00:32:24,096 --> 00:32:25,897
(scoffs)

743
00:32:27,933 --> 00:32:29,934
(dogs barking)

744
00:32:44,024 --> 00:32:46,144
Thanks. I just don't want
the harness to show.

745
00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:47,536
I mean,
the show's tacky enough.

746
00:32:47,571 --> 00:32:49,271
Well, I am missing
dinner with June

747
00:32:49,306 --> 00:32:51,440
and Diane von Furstenberg
at Annie Leibovitz's house,

748
00:32:51,475 --> 00:32:54,043
(chuckles) but... there's no
other place I'd rather be.

749
00:32:54,077 --> 00:32:55,945
Drop all the names you want,

750
00:32:55,979 --> 00:32:59,582
my old ladies are much
cooler than yours.

751
00:32:59,616 --> 00:33:02,218
It's really nice
to see you so happy.

752
00:33:02,252 --> 00:33:03,819
I never thought
that a retirement home

753
00:33:03,854 --> 00:33:05,855
can make someone smile so much.

754
00:33:05,889 --> 00:33:08,691
You know, for the first time
since I moved here, I...

755
00:33:08,725 --> 00:33:10,960
I feel like I'm doing
something with purpose.

756
00:33:10,994 --> 00:33:13,496
Besides school, of course.

757
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,564
Should I save some seats?

758
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:18,534
No, no, I'll see you after.
Okay.

759
00:33:18,568 --> 00:33:20,269
Love you.
Me, too.

760
00:33:20,303 --> 00:33:22,471
Oh, uh, don't sit
in the first row.

761
00:33:22,506 --> 00:33:24,940
I don't trust the harness.
And Gladys has been having

762
00:33:24,975 --> 00:33:27,243
a hard time keeping
solid foods down, so...

763
00:33:27,277 --> 00:33:29,178
Okay.

764
00:33:29,212 --> 00:33:30,646
Break a leg.

765
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,515
(quietly):
Thanks.

766
00:33:38,853 --> 00:33:41,333
You know, Maggie,
I was thinking,

767
00:33:41,358 --> 00:33:43,926
since your daughter and my
friends are always so busy,

768
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,828
why don't we become
each other's family?

769
00:33:45,862 --> 00:33:47,963
I mean, you'd be
doing me a favor.

770
00:33:47,998 --> 00:33:50,478
I-I could use
someone to talk to.

771
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:55,771
(laughs): Well, as long as
I'd be doing you a favor,

772
00:33:55,806 --> 00:33:57,173
I'd love to.

773
00:33:57,207 --> 00:33:58,374

RACHEL: Hello? Hey, it's me.

780
00:34:23,967 --> 00:34:27,203
Um, my show is about to start,
and I just wanted

781
00:34:27,237 --> 00:34:29,205
to wish you good luck
at the benefit.

782
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:31,907
I know things have been really
tense between us this week,

783
00:34:31,942 --> 00:34:34,110
um, but I would
never want you to think

784
00:34:34,144 --> 00:34:36,979
that I'm not proud
or supportive of you.

785
00:34:37,013 --> 00:34:39,949
Um, I'm-I'm very glad
you're doing what you're doing,

786
00:34:39,983 --> 00:34:42,184
because... my life
would certainly be dull

787
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:44,420
without friends like you
to inspire me every day.

788
00:34:44,454 --> 00:34:47,123
That is very sweet of you,
but I have to go,

makes this

the best performance of my life.

853
00:37:29,987 --> 00:37:33,856
A friend of yours told me
it was one I couldn't miss.

854
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,758
I'm so glad he did.

855
00:37:35,792 --> 00:37:38,461
I have so many things to say.

about your life.

and be so cute.
It is,

863
00:37:54,511 --> 00:37:56,045
and we'll be very cute.
Oh, dude, hold up.

864
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,848
Well, hello. This harness cannot
be good for the sack puppies.

865
00:37:58,882 --> 00:38:00,249
Oh, years of skinny jeans

866
00:38:00,283 --> 00:38:02,018
have prepared me
for this performance.

867
00:38:02,052 --> 00:38:04,320
Well, you look great.
The costume and the key.

868
00:38:04,354 --> 00:38:05,788
Yeah, I just wish
more people could see

869
00:38:05,822 --> 00:38:06,822
Maggie and the gang perform.

870
00:38:06,857 --> 00:38:08,424
I mean, they're the real stars.

871
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:10,092
Hey, there's a bus outside.

872
00:38:10,127 --> 00:38:12,228
There's a... Freddie, wake up!

873
00:38:12,262 --> 00:38:13,663
(snoring) Wake up!

874
00:38:13,697 --> 00:38:15,798
Freddie, there's a bus outside,
and it's got a lift.

875
00:38:15,832 --> 00:38:17,333
Oh, a lift?
A lift.

876
00:38:17,367 --> 00:38:19,368
Yeah, okay.
Oh, boy.

877
00:38:19,403 --> 00:38:21,203
Why is there a bus outside?

878
00:38:21,238 --> 00:38:23,172
Artie was able to get
the film school

879
00:38:23,206 --> 00:38:24,940
to loan it to us for the day.

880
00:38:24,975 --> 00:38:27,209
This is your opening night gift.

881
00:38:27,244 --> 00:38:30,346
(speaking loud and slowly):
Hey, everybody!

882
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,949
I'm Sam,

883
00:38:32,983 --> 00:38:35,217
and there's a bus outside.

884
00:38:35,252 --> 00:38:38,087
Old people usually freak me out,
but in this case,

885
00:38:38,121 --> 00:38:39,588
you guys are pretty cool.

886
00:38:39,623 --> 00:38:41,524
Anyway, Rachel has asked us

887
00:38:41,558 --> 00:38:43,159
on behalf
of the adoption charity

888
00:38:43,193 --> 00:38:45,528
Broadway Bitches,
to personally invite all of you

889
00:38:45,562 --> 00:38:47,229
to be our guest performers

890
00:38:47,264 --> 00:38:49,198
at an event we're holding
this evening.

891
00:38:49,232 --> 00:38:52,668
(applause)

892
00:38:52,703 --> 00:38:54,770
Well, what do you say, Maggie?

893
00:38:54,805 --> 00:38:57,006
Do you think you have
a second act in you?

894
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,076
I never used to believe
in second acts,

895
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:03,145
but you've proven me wrong.

896
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,448
KURT (chuckles):
Great.

897
00:39:05,482 --> 00:39:08,517
(clears throat)
To the bus, everybody!

898
00:39:11,234 --> 00:39:13,782
Hello, everyone.
Thank you so much for coming

899
00:39:13,807 --> 00:39:15,908
and supporting Broadway Bitches.

900
00:39:15,942 --> 00:39:17,910
You know, as New Yorkers,

901
00:39:17,944 --> 00:39:20,412
we get so wrapped
up in our careers

902
00:39:20,447 --> 00:39:22,448
and making it that we forget
the importance

903
00:39:22,482 --> 00:39:24,984
of really creating a legacy
that we can be proud of.

904
00:39:25,018 --> 00:39:28,220
Um, and what better way
and what's more rewarding

905
00:39:28,255 --> 00:39:31,123
than giving back
to man's best friend

906
00:39:31,158 --> 00:39:33,092
and to all of our friends,
really.

907
00:39:33,126 --> 00:39:36,328
So please join me
in giving a warm welcome

908
00:39:36,363 --> 00:39:39,665
to some very special friends who
are here today to help us out.

909
00:39:39,699 --> 00:39:42,668
From the Lexington Home
of Retired Performers,

910
00:39:42,702 --> 00:39:44,403
give it up and enjoy the song.

911
00:39:44,437 --> 00:39:46,071
If he's not going home with us,

912
00:39:46,106 --> 00:39:48,026
we need to find the perfect
home for McConaughey.

913
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:49,375
If you don't, Sam, I mean,

914
00:39:49,409 --> 00:39:50,609
we'll just,
we'll figure something out,

915
00:39:50,644 --> 00:39:52,178
but we're not gonna take him
back to the shelter.

916
00:39:52,212 --> 00:39:55,815

(laughs)

964
00:42:20,026 --> 00:42:21,494
(applause continues)

965
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:28,000
This was inspired,
to say the least.

966
00:42:28,034 --> 00:42:29,635
New Broadway mixing with old,

967
00:42:29,669 --> 00:42:31,604
plus this amazing cause.

968
00:42:31,638 --> 00:42:33,038
Where did you get
the inspiration

969
00:42:33,073 --> 00:42:34,140
to put on an event like this?

970
00:42:34,174 --> 00:42:35,641
Well, it's funny that you ask,

971
00:42:35,675 --> 00:42:38,177
because, um, I actually have
an amazing publicist.

972
00:42:38,211 --> 00:42:39,512
Well, thank you.

973
00:42:39,546 --> 00:42:42,415
Hi, uh, Santana Lopez,
public relations.

974
00:42:42,449 --> 00:42:44,950
My motto is "If I can make
Berry work, I can do anything."

975
00:42:44,985 --> 00:42:46,552
(chuckles)

976
00:42:46,586 --> 00:42:50,054
And it was actually
my really amazing friend, Kurt,

977
00:42:50,088 --> 00:42:52,823
all these incredible retired
Broadway performers.

978
00:42:52,857 --> 00:42:55,125
Oh, well, we are uploading
the video

979
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,795
that my cameraman shot
on our site immediately,

980
00:42:57,829 --> 00:43:00,763
and I am betting that we are
going to get a lot of hits.

981
00:43:00,788 --> 00:43:02,388
Thank you for all your support,

982
00:43:02,423 --> 00:43:03,756
but Rachel isn't giving herself
enough credit.

983
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:05,091
I mean, this is
a true collaboration,

984
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:08,089
- and we're just happy to
be giving back. - Yay!
