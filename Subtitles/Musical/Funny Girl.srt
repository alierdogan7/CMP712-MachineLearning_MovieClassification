What have you got?

1022

Ace of diamonds,
Mm.

I thought you were bluffing.

What do you hear from Fanny?

1029
01:20:59,063 --> 01:21:02,232
This morning she telephoned,
long-distance.

1030
01:21:02,483 --> 01:21:03,942
Oh, yeah?
How did she sound?

1031
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:07,195
Hm. Two shows in a row
and three months on the road.

1032
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:09,697
How do you think
she sounded? Tired.

1033
01:21:09,949 --> 01:21:13,576
She didn't sound tired.
Excuse me, I made a mistake.

1034
01:21:13,827 --> 01:21:15,828
She sounded silly,
she kept laughing.

1035
01:21:15,996 --> 01:21:18,790
Well, maybe something
strike her comical.

1036
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:21,793
A mother says, "How are you?"
That's so comical?

1037
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:23,419
She breaks out laughing.

1038
01:21:23,629 --> 01:21:26,381
Another thing. On the road,
she lives like a mouse.

1039
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:30,176
All day in the hotel,
all night in the theater,
no fresh air.

1040
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:33,054
But suddenly in Baltimore, MD,
she's running

1041
01:21:33,305 --> 01:21:37,600

racetracks, graveyards yet.

of what I missed before I met you.

01:22:41,999 --> 01:22:47,295
I played Baltimore before,
but never realized it was
the most beautiful city.

you'd come with us tomorrow.

yesterday and now?

Elsie lost the Baltimore Handicap.

1065

But I was watching you.

You didn't lose your ruffled shirt.

I told you that on Henry Street
