1
00:04:07,394 --> 00:04:08,861
"This is amazing, Mr Rustom"

2
00:04:08,995 --> 00:04:11,793
We've never seen anyone make
so much of progress in just a year

3
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:16,799
Do you think I'm lying? The Karan
Malhotra you're talking about...

4
00:04:17,003 --> 00:04:21,406
"used to do the rounds of my house
in a run-down jeep, only a year ago"

5
00:04:21,808 --> 00:04:24,800
The rounds of your house?
- Yes. And I used to scold him too

6
00:04:25,011 --> 00:04:29,107
"That's right. And Priya,
the girl Karan has married..."

7
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:31,943
she used to be our paying-guest.
- Really?

8
00:04:32,152 --> 00:04:34,211
See that group of boys and girls
over there?

9
00:04:34,354 --> 00:04:38,290
They were part of Karan's band in
which Karan and Priya used to sing

10
00:04:41,127 --> 00:04:43,425
Karan and Priya
look fabulous!

11
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:13,389
Congratulations on the wedding!
- Thanks

12
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:17,596
Whom do you give credit for making it
from a small time dance troupe...

13
00:05:17,797 --> 00:05:20,595
to this huge bungalow?
Is it your hardwork or destiny?

14
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:23,401
The credit of my success
goes only to Priya

15
00:05:24,004 --> 00:05:27,735
I only dreamt big.
Had she not been with me...

16
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:30,941
"my dreams would never be fulfilled.
- You're very lucky, Mrs Malhotra"

17
00:05:31,277 --> 00:05:34,269
Your husband gives you
all the credit for his success

18
00:05:34,948 --> 00:05:37,746
"That's how much he loves me,
but I did nothing"

19
00:05:38,084 --> 00:05:41,542
I only walked the path
he showed me

20
00:05:50,964 --> 00:05:57,699
"We're so fortunate, Karan.
We have everything we wanted"

21
00:05:59,005 --> 00:06:01,974
The best of my good-fortunes
is that you are with me

22
00:06:04,778 --> 00:06:07,770
Will you always love me so much?

23
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,985
Will I always be so dear to you?

24
00:06:15,388 --> 00:06:17,379
"Wake up, Priya"

25
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:21,984
It's eight

26
00:06:22,462 --> 00:06:24,987
You've got to go to
the rehearsals

27
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:29,332
"Karan, what's wrong with your voice?"

28
00:06:30,003 --> 00:06:33,200
"Karan? Priya, I'm Kajal, not Karan!
Wake up now!"

29
00:06:34,107 --> 00:06:37,474
"Wake up, Priya... wake up"

30
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:44,281
You? I had such a lovely dream...
why did you wake me up?

31
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:46,749
Karan's been waiting for you
downstairs from a long time

32
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:47,945
Go on

33
00:06:55,962 --> 00:06:57,827
Shut that horn... stop it!

34
00:06:57,997 --> 00:07:00,227
"Why did you throw garbage
on me, Rustom Uncle?"

35
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,836
D'you expect me to shower rose-petals?
How often have I told you...

36
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:07,303
not to honk here early in the day
and cause noise-pollution

37
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,977
You could use your mouth to say it?
- I have blisters trying to tell you!

38
00:07:12,245 --> 00:07:14,770
I have to honk because
you won't let me go upstairs

39
00:07:15,014 --> 00:07:17,574
Haven't I told you that this
is a dormitory for girls?

40
00:07:17,784 --> 00:07:20,548
"If I let boys upstairs, what if
something untoward happened?"

41
00:07:21,387 --> 00:07:24,618
What good morning?
He's ruined my morning! Go away!

42
00:07:24,858 --> 00:07:26,985
"Sure, I'll go away. Where's Priya?
- She'll be ready in five minutes"

43
00:07:27,327 --> 00:07:29,795
So I'll leave. Come to the
rehearsal hall as soon as possible

44
00:07:31,164 --> 00:07:33,155
Now look here.
Today's the 30th

45
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:37,667
Ask Priya to pack her bags.
I want my room vacated

46
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:41,600
I don't want these everyday hassles.
You play music the whole night...

47
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:44,935
and won't let me go to sleep!
And this guy arrives at 8...

48
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:47,602
to honk and ruin my sleep!
- Rustom!

49
00:07:47,947 --> 00:07:50,939
What is it?
- Your breakfast is served

50
00:07:51,451 --> 00:07:53,942
Why're you getting angry with
the kids so early in the day?

51
00:07:54,254 --> 00:07:56,688
You're angry with me
and I'm angry with them!

52
00:07:56,956 --> 00:07:58,947
Shut up and come on inside.
Your breakfast is ready

53
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:02,720
Ready indeed! Eggs and buns again.
- If you drive the girls away...

54
00:08:02,962 --> 00:08:05,658
how will we get a free ticket
to go on a cruise?

55
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:08,092
Let them find a job
on the ship first!

56
00:08:24,117 --> 00:08:26,347
"What are you up to, Aditi?
- What happened?"

57
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:29,716
Your movements are okay.
But your expressions!

58
00:08:32,358 --> 00:08:35,225
"Is this any time to come, Priya?
You said 5 minutes, it's an hour!"

59
00:08:35,862 --> 00:08:38,990
Don't be angry. I've got something
important to tell you. Come

60
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:42,399
"Sit down, I must tell you something!"

61
00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:46,004
Know what? You looked smashing
in a suit today

62
00:08:46,406 --> 00:08:48,806
I haven't worn a suit in years.
When did you see me in a suit?

63
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:53,001
"In my dreams! I had a lovely dream
this morning, Karan!"

64
00:08:53,446 --> 00:08:56,176
"I dreamed that we had a bungalow,
a fleet of cars..."

65
00:08:56,416 --> 00:09:00,352
you're the owner of a leading
music company. And we're marrying!

66
00:09:00,753 --> 00:09:05,520
Our reception is being attended
by the cream of Bombay's society!

67
00:09:06,893 --> 00:09:08,884
Your dream will surely come true

68
00:09:09,128 --> 00:09:11,460
Only our troupe must get selected
to perform on the cruise

69
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:15,032
I'm sure our troupe will be selected
to perform on the cruise

70
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:18,701
I'm not much worried
about the other troupes...

71
00:09:18,838 --> 00:09:21,830
but Jojo Fernandes will be
our main rival at the audition

72
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:25,577
He has so much of experience.
- So what if he has experience?

73
00:09:25,712 --> 00:09:30,046
"We have the spirit, the passion!
We'll work hard, day and night!"

74
00:09:54,874 --> 00:09:57,604
No need for the rehearsals.
The audition has been called off

75
00:09:58,244 --> 00:10:00,872
Why?
- They have selected Jojo Fernandes...

76
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:03,915
without an audition.
- How can that happen?

77
00:10:04,183 --> 00:10:06,879
We've worked through the days and
nights to prepare for the audition...

78
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,011
and they select Jojo Fernandes?

79
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:12,850
I'll personally go and meet the
owner of Singhania Shipping

80
00:10:13,026 --> 00:10:15,017
"It's extremely difficult
to meet Raj Singhania, Karan"

81
00:10:15,094 --> 00:10:17,688
"He's such a busy man, you've got to
take an appointment weeks in advance"

82
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:20,625
Whatever happens...
I'm going to meet him

83
00:10:41,988 --> 00:10:43,683
Grandma

84
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,324
"Good morning, grandma.
How are you?"

85
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:52,987
I'm okay. Now quickly switch on
your computer. I want to see you

86
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:55,724
It's a week since I last saw you

87
00:11:01,574 --> 00:11:03,371
"Switch on your camera, will you?"

88
00:11:07,046 --> 00:11:11,005
"What a sight you are!
Unkempt hair, a stubble?"

89
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:14,011
"I was at my workouts, grandma.
So I look like this"

90
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:21,153
Stop flattering me and tell me
when you are coming to Jaipur

91
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:25,693
"Grandma, our cruise sets out
next week. The day it returns..."

92
00:11:25,832 --> 00:11:27,823
I'll come to you in Jaipur

93
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:31,295
How is Darshan?
I hope he's taking care of you?

94
00:11:31,604 --> 00:11:35,301
"Taking care of me?
I've got to take care of him, grandma"

95
00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:38,303
He keeps giving every story
a strange twist

96
00:11:38,845 --> 00:11:41,143
"If I ask him why, he says
What if it happened?"

97
00:11:42,382 --> 00:11:44,373
But he's very good at heart

98
00:11:54,327 --> 00:11:57,592
Have Darshan and Saxena arrived?
- They're waiting for you in the hall

99
00:11:58,097 --> 00:12:00,861
Some things always ought
to be kept a secret

100
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,432
And Raj loves this quality in me

101
00:12:07,907 --> 00:12:11,138
"What are you doing, Mrs Braganza?
You've been here for so many years..."

102
00:12:11,277 --> 00:12:13,268
is this any way of serving tea?
You've spilt it!

103
00:12:13,346 --> 00:12:15,871
"It's okay, Mr Darshan.
I'll wipe it out"

104
00:12:16,082 --> 00:12:20,610
"It's okay, you say? This incident
could have set my house on fire!"

105
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,817
Fire? That's strange

106
00:12:23,056 --> 00:12:25,786
"How could your house be on fire,
for the tea that is spilt?"

107
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:30,224
"Simple logic. Had the tea fallen
on me, it'd have left a stain"

108
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,621
I'd have gone home with the stain...

109
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:35,632
and my wife would mistake it
for a lipstick mark

110
00:12:35,968 --> 00:12:39,563
"She'd fight with me, because she'd
think I'm having an affair!"

111
00:12:40,106 --> 00:12:43,974
And she'd try to commit suicide.
She'd set herself on fire...

112
00:12:44,143 --> 00:12:47,670
"and burn down my house too.
- But you're still a bachelor, Darshan"

113
00:12:47,847 --> 00:12:50,372
"Where have you been married?
- What "if" I were already married?"

114
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,982
Wouldn't it burn my house?
And you're telling me!

115
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,780
Right?
- Right...

116
00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:58,648
"Whose house is burnt, Darshan?
What are you talking about?"

117
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:02,528
"Actually, I've been teaching them
some logic Raj bhaiyya"

118
00:13:02,995 --> 00:13:05,793
"If they still don't understand, there
will be a flood in this house someday"

119
00:13:05,998 --> 00:13:09,126
But don't ask me how!
- Am I crazy to ask you?

120
00:13:09,469 --> 00:13:11,994
Try asking... I guarantee you
a flood!

121
00:13:12,805 --> 00:13:15,569
"Darshan, take Saxena's car
and go to the ad agency"

122
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:17,870
Collect the publicity material
from one Mr Jacob there

123
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:21,803
"You come with me, Saxena.
- Right, sir"

124
00:13:43,035 --> 00:13:45,697
Have copies of our agreements
with Star Cruise...

125
00:13:45,972 --> 00:13:48,964
"despatched to Singapore, Malaysia
and Bangkok today itself"

126
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,639
I received email from them
this morning

127
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,798
You can't have an appointment
with Mr Singhania this week

128
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:19,560
And he's sailing next week.
- It's in connection with that...

129
00:14:19,672 --> 00:14:22,163
that I must discuss something
important with him. If you could...

130
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:37,746
Praise the Lord...

131
00:14:41,427 --> 00:14:44,521
"Where to, feller? This lift is
meant for the bosses"

132
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,291
The common-lift's over there.
Get going

133
00:14:46,365 --> 00:14:49,857
"I say, Shiv Prasad...
- My name is Gauri Shankar"

134
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:55,666
Gauri Shankar! What difference?
They're both names for Lord Shiva!

135
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:59,709
That's true. Praise Lord Shiva!
- Gauri Shankar...

136
00:14:59,979 --> 00:15:02,777
I don't want to go in your lift.
Could you tell me...

137
00:15:02,982 --> 00:15:07,476
"on which floor you left Mr Singhania?
- Company rules, my friend..."

138
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:11,714
we can't tell outsiders anything
about the bosses. Sorry...

139
00:15:11,991 --> 00:15:15,324
I can't tell you I've dropped
Mr Singhania on the 20th floor

140
00:15:17,997 --> 00:15:22,161
"All right, don't tell me.
Could you at least tell me..."

141
00:15:22,335 --> 00:15:25,668
which section he has gone to?
- You're an amazing man!

142
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:29,668
When I won't tell you that I left
my boss on the 20th floor...

143
00:15:29,942 --> 00:15:32,934
how will I tell you that the boss
has gone to the accounts department?

144
00:15:33,746 --> 00:15:36,271
"You do follow the rules
very strictly, I say"

145
00:15:36,482 --> 00:15:39,679
I have to... I'm very
strict about such things

146
00:15:39,952 --> 00:15:45,447
"I don't know how, but every visitor
gets to know everything about the boss"

147
00:15:46,058 --> 00:15:49,459
Like it happened yesterday.
Mr Chopra's wife was here

148
00:15:49,962 --> 00:15:52,760
"She asked me a million times,
but I wouldn't tell her..."

149
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:57,629
"that Mr Chopra wasn't in his office,
he was in the stores with his secretary"

150
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,961
Don't tell me!
- But she got to know

151
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:02,297
She rushed to the stores...

152
00:16:02,508 --> 00:16:05,568
and caught Mr Chopra in a compromising
position with his secretary

153
00:16:06,045 --> 00:16:10,311
How could she have got to know?
- There's surely a traitor around

154
00:16:10,983 --> 00:16:12,382
Of course

155
00:16:12,818 --> 00:16:17,152
"This accounts department?
Is it to the left, or to the right?"

156
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:20,655
I can tell you that. It has
nothing to do with the boss!

157
00:16:21,994 --> 00:16:24,986
"The accounts department is neither
to the left, nor to the right"

158
00:16:25,331 --> 00:16:28,266
Walk right ahead...
there you are!

159
00:16:29,435 --> 00:16:32,927
"See you. Thanks, Shiv Prasad...
- Shiv Prasad?"

160
00:16:33,506 --> 00:16:37,203
"What difference? Both are
names for Lord Shiva, after all"

161
00:16:37,943 --> 00:16:39,376
Praise the Lord!

162
00:16:40,846 --> 00:16:43,679
"Several countries have requested
extra tickets, despite their quota"

163
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:46,177
"Our cruise is a success,
even before it sets sail"

164
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:50,949
"No, Saxena. Our cruise will be
a success when people praise it"

165
00:16:51,424 --> 00:16:53,619
"And they will praise it, sir"

166
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,688
"After all, they are travelling
on our cruise for the comfort"

167
00:16:56,862 --> 00:16:58,853
"And the comfort our cruise offers
is world-class, sir"

168
00:16:58,964 --> 00:17:01,762
People can find comforts
even in 5-star and 7-star hotels

169
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:06,300
There is only one thing which will give
people satisfaction on the cruise

170
00:17:06,706 --> 00:17:09,300
"Know what that is?
- Entertainment, sir"

171
00:17:09,575 --> 00:17:11,634
The biggest USP of your cruise

172
00:17:12,645 --> 00:17:14,442
Which department are you from?

173
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,578
"I'm not from a department
of your company, sir"

174
00:17:17,983 --> 00:17:20,975
I'm Karan Malhotra and I wish to
talk to you for only five minutes

175
00:17:21,287 --> 00:17:23,687
What I want to say
has to do with entertainment

176
00:17:23,856 --> 00:17:26,984
"Whatever you wish to say, can't
be said without an appointment"

177
00:17:27,226 --> 00:17:30,354
"Wait a minute, Saxena...
what do you wish to say?"

178
00:17:30,629 --> 00:17:34,156
"I have a dance-troupe, sir.
Like many dance troupes in the city..."

179
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:36,928
I too had applied to perform
on your cruise

180
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:40,067
We were told that an audition
would be held for all of us

181
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:42,933
"But we were told this morning that
Jojo Fernandes was chosen..."

182
00:17:43,075 --> 00:17:47,171
without even an audition!
I only want to know...

183
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:49,941
why your company has indulged
in such discrimination

184
00:17:51,016 --> 00:17:53,610
"Is it true, Saxena?
- Yes, sir"

185
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:57,619
There's only a week for the cruise
to sail and there's a lot to do

186
00:17:57,957 --> 00:18:01,950
And the Jojo Fernandes we have chosen
is the very best in Mumbai

187
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:05,961
"I know, ours is a new troupe
compared to Jojo's"

188
00:18:06,432 --> 00:18:10,232
"But yours is a new cruise too, sir.
People are skipping the old ones..."

189
00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:15,568
"to travel on your cruise. And why?
Because people now want novelty, sir"

190
00:18:15,975 --> 00:18:17,966
And our troupe has the novelty!

191
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:21,304
I only want you to give me
an opportunity to prove that

192
00:18:23,048 --> 00:18:25,983
"Saxena, arrange for an audition.
Call the judges..."

193
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:14,347
What happened?

194
00:21:26,165 --> 00:21:28,827
"Congratulations, Jojo.
You have been selected"

195
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:32,827
"You can't do this, sir!
We have been cheated!"

196
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:35,768
"I took this decision going by
the judges' approval, Mr Karan"

197
00:21:35,975 --> 00:21:38,967
"But I saw him...
- I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do"

198
00:21:39,411 --> 00:21:42,972
"One second, sir...
- C'mon Karan. Learn to accept defeat!"

199
00:21:46,085 --> 00:21:49,418
"Our troupe has worked very hard
for this audition, Jojo"

200
00:21:49,888 --> 00:21:52,789
Now go and tell Mr Saxena that you
tossed a coin on the floor!

201
00:21:52,992 --> 00:21:54,391
Are you crazy?

202
00:21:57,896 --> 00:22:00,990
You don't win a competition
merely by prancing around

203
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:04,427
"You need brains to win it.
What say, guys?"

204
00:23:25,017 --> 00:23:28,009
You? You come all the way here?

205
00:23:31,957 --> 00:23:34,448
"You were seething at the
competition, weren't you?"

206
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,857
What makes you so calm now?

207
00:23:36,962 --> 00:23:40,728
"I get it. You will say,
Jojo, forget what has happened..."

208
00:23:41,033 --> 00:23:43,968
give me employment in your troupe.
Am I right?

209
00:23:45,304 --> 00:23:48,967
Why are you so quiet?
What's the problem?

210
00:23:50,042 --> 00:23:52,476
I'm with you.
I'll give you a job

211
00:23:52,711 --> 00:23:55,976
I'll give you a job
and that babe of yours too

212
00:23:56,415 --> 00:23:58,849
Now go and bring her over

213
00:23:59,251 --> 00:24:03,711
I'll take a test of hers tonight
and hire you both tomorrow

214
00:24:09,128 --> 00:24:11,619
You'll take a test of hers?

215
00:24:15,534 --> 00:24:17,525
You want to test her?

216
00:24:50,969 --> 00:24:54,632
"Had we been selected, we'd have
been going on the cruise right now"

217
00:24:54,973 --> 00:24:57,771
We wouldn't have been
depressed like this

218
00:25:07,986 --> 00:25:09,977
"Yes, Karan is right here"

219
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:14,591
This is his partner speaking.
What is this regarding?

220
00:25:16,061 --> 00:25:17,358
What?

221
00:25:19,164 --> 00:25:21,325
What are you saying?

222
00:25:34,947 --> 00:25:37,507
What happened?
- Singhania Corporation called...

223
00:25:37,616 --> 00:25:40,210
to say that we've been chosen
to perform on the cruise!

224
00:25:45,224 --> 00:25:47,852
"Know what, Karan? Jojo Fernandes
died in an accident last night!"

225
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,292
And they've chosen us to
replace him on the cruise!

226
00:25:50,362 --> 00:25:52,626
"See Karan? Bad guys, bad endings"

227
00:25:53,298 --> 00:25:55,823
We've got to send our passports
to their office immediately

228
00:25:56,034 --> 00:25:57,968
We're leaving for Singapore tomorrow!

229
00:26:26,164 --> 00:26:29,998
"Karan, this is the first step
we take in realising our dreams"

230
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:33,930
"The first step is difficult to come by.
They come thick and fast, afterwards"

231
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:54,820
It's such a big ship!
Just like a 5-star hotel!

232
00:26:55,027 --> 00:26:58,622
"Not a 5-star hotel,
it's like a 7-star hotel darling!"

233
00:26:59,965 --> 00:27:01,557
"Karan, my boy..."

234
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:07,764
you may take my house in exchange
for a permanent room on this ship

235
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,976
"Even we aren't permanent yet, Rustom.
We're still temporary"

236
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:15,241
Let's go

237
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:19,783
"You're the limit, Rustom. He gave us
two complimentary tickets on the ship"

238
00:27:20,052 --> 00:27:23,112
And you now want a permanent room.
You don't have any sense!

239
00:27:23,422 --> 00:27:26,118
Let's go.
- Stop talking and come on

240
00:27:26,892 --> 00:27:32,262
"Rosy darling, I'm terribly scared. We
shouldn't have brought John on the ship"

241
00:27:32,698 --> 00:27:35,599
So what should we have done?
Should we have left him at home?

242
00:27:36,068 --> 00:27:40,937
What sort of a man are you?
John is only 2 years old

243
00:27:42,941 --> 00:27:47,935
"Look, that 2-year old darling of yours
is trying to get out of the basket"

244
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:54,513
"He's not trying to get out of the
basket, he only wants some fresh air"

245
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,221
"Keep your stuff in your cabins
and come to the auditorium, Harry"

246
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:00,281
We'll check out the systems first

247
00:28:15,407 --> 00:28:17,739
"All this is thanks to
your blessings, grandma"

248
00:28:17,843 --> 00:28:20,311
Where are you right now?
- We've just left Singapore

249
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:22,973
We're midseas right now.
- Do telephone me every day

250
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:25,978
"Sure, grandma. I'll give
you a call everyday, okay?"

251
00:28:29,388 --> 00:28:30,878
"Go on, Saxena"

252
00:28:33,025 --> 00:28:36,256
Tell them that I'll personally
discuss it with them in Mumbai

253
00:29:12,364 --> 00:29:15,162
"Raj, the captain wants a copy
of the permission for docking"

254
00:29:15,267 --> 00:29:18,031
It's lying there.
- Where?

255
00:29:22,908 --> 00:29:24,432
Raj...

256
00:29:24,709 --> 00:29:27,439
want me to tell you
something confidential?

257
00:29:28,046 --> 00:29:30,981
War is about to break out
between India and America

258
00:29:31,983 --> 00:29:34,451
"Since our cruise is a success..."

259
00:29:34,686 --> 00:29:37,553
"the American shipping industry
will close down..."

260
00:29:37,656 --> 00:29:39,988
"America will be out on the streets
and out of frustration..."

261
00:29:40,092 --> 00:29:42,253
will launch an attack!
- The shipping industry...

262
00:29:42,327 --> 00:29:46,787
"is based in Greece, not America.
- If it was based in America?"

263
00:29:46,998 --> 00:29:48,795
Wouldn't there be a war?

264
00:29:53,004 --> 00:29:55,199
"Even after 20 helpings of this,
I'm not going to get any fatter"

265
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,009
I can see that

266
00:30:05,317 --> 00:30:07,308
I took a walk on the deck today

267
00:30:08,587 --> 00:30:12,580
Just imagine how romantic and beautiful
the deck will look at night

268
00:30:13,024 --> 00:30:16,824
What with the open skies and the
twinkling stars... am I right?

269
00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:20,696
What are you staring at?
- The stars you're talking about...

270
00:30:20,832 --> 00:30:22,823
they're actually in your eyes

271
00:30:24,603 --> 00:30:28,039
You and I will go to the deck
all by ourselves tonight

272
00:30:29,174 --> 00:30:30,971
"Karan, aren't you having anything?"

273
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,778
I thought you'd fall short of it

274
00:30:36,982 --> 00:30:39,416
"I'll have only orange-juice.
Will you have something, Karan?"

275
00:30:39,584 --> 00:30:40,881
Anything will do

276
00:30:50,061 --> 00:30:52,552
What is it?
- You know why...

277
00:30:52,764 --> 00:30:56,495
I brought you on this luxury cruise.
- Why did you?

278
00:30:57,068 --> 00:31:00,765
Because you shower all
your affection on Johny

279
00:31:01,006 --> 00:31:04,806
Give Tommy a bit of your love
at least some time!

280
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:08,807
"Old men don't get love,
they get respect. Get that?"

281
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:13,676
So why did you marry me then?
- How was I to know that you're old?

282
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,012
I discovered it on the
night of our honeymoon...

283
00:31:16,087 --> 00:31:18,920
that you're wearing a wig
and a set of dentures!

284
00:31:19,024 --> 00:31:21,618
Don't make me say anymore. Okay?

285
00:31:33,405 --> 00:31:34,770
Help!

286
00:32:19,184 --> 00:32:20,811
My skirt!

287
00:33:25,317 --> 00:33:29,811
"Actually, there was that dog
after me..."

288
00:33:32,023 --> 00:33:36,756
"I was very scared,
my skirt gave way and..."

289
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,767
That puppy...

290
00:33:49,974 --> 00:33:53,307
I'm really very sorry
to have disturbed you

291
00:33:56,114 --> 00:33:57,979
I'm leaving now

292
00:34:02,787 --> 00:34:05,381
Maybe you locked the door
when you walked inside

293
00:35:45,824 --> 00:35:49,282
"Looks like you haven't recognised me.
I'm Karan Malhotra, sir"

294
00:35:51,396 --> 00:35:53,956
I came to your office without an
appointment... for the audition?

295
00:35:54,365 --> 00:35:57,630
Oh yes. It's your troupe that is
performing on the cruise

296
00:35:57,869 --> 00:36:00,531
"Right, right...
Today's our first show, sir"

297
00:36:00,772 --> 00:36:04,833
"Please do attend. I can assure you,
you'll get what you want in our show"

298
00:37:38,536 --> 00:37:40,595
I can't tolerate it anymore

299
00:37:40,772 --> 00:37:43,935
"I can't stay away from you
even for a day"

300
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:46,938
Not even for a day

301
00:39:00,418 --> 00:39:05,014
Love is amazing

302
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:09,383
It raises a million questions

303
00:39:18,503 --> 00:39:20,368
It makes you dream...

304
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:22,462
it awakens an aching

305
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,731
It adds to your woes...

306
00:39:24,976 --> 00:39:27,103
it takes you around paradise too

307
00:39:27,378 --> 00:39:29,778
"Where will we go away
from paradise?"

308
00:39:29,947 --> 00:39:32,973
"Where?
Oh, where will we go?"

309
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,991
I can't tolerate it anymore

310
00:39:51,069 --> 00:39:54,334
"I can't stay away from you
even for a day"

311
00:39:54,572 --> 00:39:57,405
Not even for a day

312
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:04,732
"What is love worth,
if it isn't for desire?"

313
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:09,139
"What is life worth,
without the beloved?"

314
00:41:18,356 --> 00:41:22,019
"Love keeps you going...
but it also torments you"

315
00:41:22,493 --> 00:41:26,691
"It brings you closer,
but it also increases the distances"

316
00:41:27,198 --> 00:41:31,965
"Let these distances be
done away with then"

317
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,371
I can't tolerate it anymore

318
00:41:44,482 --> 00:41:47,747
"I can't stay away from you
even for a day"

319
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:50,986
Not even for a day

320
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:28,185
We made a great first impression.
What an amazing response for the show!

321
00:42:28,526 --> 00:42:31,120
That's because our co-ordination
was perfect

322
00:42:31,362 --> 00:42:34,297
And why not? I had rehearsed so much.
- Oh sure...

323
00:42:34,398 --> 00:42:36,889
"she's the only one who rehearsed,
none of us did anything at all"

324
00:42:36,968 --> 00:42:37,764
Fatso!

325
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:46,969
A bouquet from Raj Singhania!

326
00:42:53,985 --> 00:42:56,647
And listen to this...
the show as superb

327
00:43:04,161 --> 00:43:07,153
"Priya, Raj Singhania
has invited you to dinner!"

328
00:43:07,365 --> 00:43:10,664
Not fair. All of us worked hard
and only you get invited

329
00:43:12,003 --> 00:43:15,564
I'm not going all alone.
We'll all go together

330
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,674
No Priya. Don't do that

331
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,738
"If you don't go, Raj Singhania
will feel very hurt"

332
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,479
Think of the great honour
he has bestowed on you

333
00:43:25,016 --> 00:43:27,678
"Yes, and it isn't an honour
just for you. It's for all of us"

334
00:44:22,606 --> 00:44:25,734
"I've been on this ship, but
I didn't get to see this place"

335
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:29,741
It's meant only for my special guests.
And you're my first guest

336
00:44:44,462 --> 00:44:46,692
I've watched a lot of shows

337
00:44:53,037 --> 00:44:55,301
As for yours and Karan's
performance...

338
00:44:57,975 --> 00:45:00,569
"It looked as if it wasn't a
performance, as if it were for real"

339
00:45:00,978 --> 00:45:03,776
"What is a performance that
doesn't look real, sir?"

340
00:45:08,986 --> 00:45:13,514
"Please stop flattering me so much.
Else, I'm going to be very conscious"

341
00:45:14,158 --> 00:45:17,992
"All right, but you will
call me Raj. Not sir"

342
00:45:19,997 --> 00:45:21,794
Sir again?

343
00:45:21,999 --> 00:45:24,797
"The next time you say that, I'm going
to push my 'sar' (head) ahead!"

344
00:45:50,461 --> 00:45:53,953
What are you thinking about?
You're such a great dancer...

345
00:45:54,298 --> 00:45:57,165
I'm the one who ought
to feel apprehensive

346
00:46:31,735 --> 00:46:33,930
I've heard that music somewhere

347
00:46:34,638 --> 00:46:38,301
You must've heard it in my office
yesterday. It's my favourite

348
00:46:38,742 --> 00:46:40,733
"Whenever I hear it,
I feel very relaxed"

349
00:46:40,945 --> 00:46:43,937
And how are you feeling now?

350
00:46:46,317 --> 00:46:49,684
"The one I was always looking for,
is now with me"

351
00:46:49,954 --> 00:46:53,617
You were looking for me? What for?
- To give you the heart

352
00:46:54,024 --> 00:46:55,286
What?

353
00:46:55,759 --> 00:46:58,626
You forgot your heart
in my office yesterday

354
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:04,467
"I didn't even realise it!
- Matters of the heart, you see"

355
00:47:05,136 --> 00:47:09,368
You never know when you lose
your heart to someone

356
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,975
What would anyone do with
such a little heart anyway?

357
00:47:13,644 --> 00:47:16,636
One could wear it around his neck
and keep it close to his heart

358
00:47:17,481 --> 00:47:21,884
I can't believe that a business
tycoon like you can be as romantic!

359
00:47:22,987 --> 00:47:25,785
Why not? Does a business tycoon
not have a heart?

360
00:47:33,097 --> 00:47:35,691
"How are you, son?
- I'm fine grandma. How are you?"

361
00:47:35,933 --> 00:47:37,264
I'm okay

362
00:47:37,434 --> 00:47:39,664
"Grandma, I want to introduce you
to a friend of mine"

363
00:47:39,837 --> 00:47:42,931
A friend?
- Yes. Switch on your computer

364
00:47:45,276 --> 00:47:48,268
"Come, I'll introduce you to grandma.
- Your grandma?"

365
00:47:53,384 --> 00:47:55,944
Where's the friend
you want me to meet?

366
00:47:56,287 --> 00:47:57,754
"Come, Priya"

367
00:48:00,658 --> 00:48:03,388
"Grandma, this is Priya.
- Namaste"

368
00:48:03,961 --> 00:48:07,590
May you live long.
How long have you known Raj?

369
00:48:08,065 --> 00:48:10,397
We met on the ship

370
00:48:11,302 --> 00:48:13,566
Who else is there in your family?

371
00:48:14,305 --> 00:48:16,296
I'm all alone

372
00:48:17,441 --> 00:48:19,432
Who did you come with
on the ship?

373
00:48:19,977 --> 00:48:23,777
I perform in the shows
that are held on the ship

374
00:48:26,483 --> 00:48:29,384
"So long, grandma.
I'll talk to you tomorrow. Okay?"

375
00:48:29,987 --> 00:48:32,785
How's everyone else at home?
Convey my regards to uncle and aunt

376
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:37,484
Give my love to the young ones.
The kids too

377
00:48:49,807 --> 00:48:51,798
What are you looking at?

378
00:48:52,009 --> 00:48:54,603
You can see everything from here

379
00:48:54,878 --> 00:48:57,005
"On the outside, it appears
to be a mirror"

380
00:48:57,181 --> 00:49:00,617
You mean... you saw
everything yesterday?

381
00:49:01,018 --> 00:49:07,014
"Everything. Your performance,
your dance..."

382
00:49:07,558 --> 00:49:09,685
and your flying kiss

383
00:49:32,983 --> 00:49:35,713
"Yash, you're ahead by a beat.
It's all out of sync"

384
00:49:36,086 --> 00:49:39,647
"Your position has changed too.
- Sorry, I'll set it right"

385
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:42,984
How many times do I tell you
that you're position is over here!

386
00:49:43,327 --> 00:49:45,318
"Keep a distance from him,
or it'll look awful"

387
00:49:50,801 --> 00:49:53,531
Guess where Raj took me for dinner?
- Where?

388
00:49:53,704 --> 00:49:57,003
In his special lounge! A place
reserved for his special guests

389
00:50:01,312 --> 00:50:05,009
"Especially for me! The dancing,
the dinner, the wine..."

390
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:13,012
"He has style in everything he does,
a special way of his own..."

391
00:50:13,257 --> 00:50:16,249
I was absolutely zapped!

392
00:50:16,694 --> 00:50:19,629
I think our troupe is going
to get permanent status!

393
00:50:25,035 --> 00:50:30,029
"I beg your pardon. I bring bad news,
but you mustn't be disheartened"

394
00:50:30,974 --> 00:50:33,306
I know the benefits
a temporary worker enjoys

395
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:37,979
"The ones with temporary jobs
are their own bosses, not servants"

396
00:50:38,315 --> 00:50:40,647
"They can work when they want to,
or kick their jobs"

397
00:50:40,751 --> 00:50:43,982
"They spend their time anywhere...
they enjoy freedom, you know"

398
00:50:44,488 --> 00:50:46,786
"If you're singing on a ship today,
you might sing in a train tomorrow..."

399
00:50:46,857 --> 00:50:49,519
"or maybe the tower, the plane
or the Moon!"

400
00:50:50,994 --> 00:50:56,660
"I'm sorry to say this, but our boss
couldn't bear to see your freedom"

401
00:50:57,334 --> 00:51:01,134
So... he has given you
permanent status

402
00:51:01,805 --> 00:51:05,002
What?
- I tried to make him see reason

403
00:51:05,342 --> 00:51:08,675
"I said, please don't do this.
Let them enjoy..."

404
00:51:09,012 --> 00:51:11,572
"You mean, we're now permanent?"

405
00:51:11,749 --> 00:51:14,183
Give me just two days.
I'll talk him out of it

406
00:51:18,021 --> 00:51:21,821
You really had us scared!
You sure do have a sense of humour!

407
00:51:30,033 --> 00:51:31,967
"Strange boys and girls, I say!"

408
00:51:38,976 --> 00:51:42,639
"Karan, everything is happening
the way you wanted it to"

409
00:51:43,247 --> 00:51:46,580
Our troupe has been selected
and we have permanent status too

410
00:51:46,984 --> 00:51:49,782
This ship is only a means
of reaching our goal

411
00:51:50,254 --> 00:51:52,779
Our goal is not to merely
become stage performers...

412
00:51:53,056 --> 00:51:55,650
we've got to be rich
and influential folks

413
00:51:55,993 --> 00:51:58,689
"After marriage, I want
to give you everything"

414
00:52:01,098 --> 00:52:04,465
And so much of love
that no man ever gave his wife

415
00:52:05,869 --> 00:52:07,700
You can fulfill your promise

416
00:52:08,005 --> 00:52:11,907
But the ship reaches Malaysia tomorrow.
Aren't we going sightseeing in Malaysia?

417
00:52:12,109 --> 00:52:14,270
"Let us reach our goal,
and what is Malaysia..."

418
00:52:14,378 --> 00:52:17,006
I'll take you around the whole world!

419
00:52:28,258 --> 00:52:31,352
At six. Exactly.
- Right here?

420
00:52:34,965 --> 00:52:37,763
Don't forget to bring
what I've asked you for!

421
00:52:39,002 --> 00:52:40,765
And come back soon

422
00:52:46,777 --> 00:52:48,768
You haven't gone around Malaysia?
- No

423
00:52:48,979 --> 00:52:50,970
Why not?
- Because of you

424
00:52:51,048 --> 00:52:52,879
Because of me!
- Yes

425
00:52:52,983 --> 00:52:54,974
You gave our troupe
permanent status yesterday...

426
00:52:55,052 --> 00:52:57,543
and that adds to our responsibility.
To do better in every show...

427
00:52:57,654 --> 00:53:01,715
some of us will remain in the ship
for the rehearsals

428
00:53:01,892 --> 00:53:04,793
"Rehearsals can happen later.
Come on, let's go out"

429
00:53:04,995 --> 00:53:08,988
"I can't go, I have another reason.
- I'm not listening to anything, okay?"

430
00:53:25,015 --> 00:53:27,415
I have yet to see
a sincere girl like you

431
00:53:27,751 --> 00:53:31,551
The whole group goes sightseeing...
- And I've yet to see a boss like you

432
00:53:31,955 --> 00:53:35,652
Your employee wants to work
and you take her out

433
00:53:36,126 --> 00:53:38,959
"I stand to gain, even in that.
- How come?"

434
00:53:39,663 --> 00:53:42,291
A beautiful girl keeps me company
for ten hours

435
00:53:57,748 --> 00:53:58,976
"Come, Priya"

436
00:54:04,421 --> 00:54:07,652
This is the best restaurant
in Malaysia. Let's eat first...

437
00:54:07,991 --> 00:54:11,256
and go sightseeing later.
- But I can't go with you

438
00:54:11,595 --> 00:54:13,790
Why not?
- They must have a dress-code here

439
00:54:14,131 --> 00:54:18,659
And I'm not properly dressed.
- What are you talking about?

440
00:54:20,137 --> 00:54:24,005
Come on.
- I haven't worn any sandals

441
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:29,276
Why not?
- I had taken a pledge that...

442
00:54:29,613 --> 00:54:33,344
"should our troupe be made permanent,
I'd spend 24 hours barefoot"

443
00:54:33,684 --> 00:54:38,519
I wanted to tell you on the ship.
But you didn't give me the opportunity

444
00:54:39,056 --> 00:54:41,616
It must be a very insignificant
thing for you...

445
00:54:41,959 --> 00:54:45,759
but it's a huge event for our troupe.
I have a suggestion

446
00:54:46,129 --> 00:54:50,498
"Drop me at the ship, or you'll have to
face embarrassment because of me"

447
00:54:51,969 --> 00:54:56,668
Right. Embarrassed I will be. If
you're the only one who's barefoot

448
00:54:59,142 --> 00:55:00,973
What are you doing?

449
00:55:01,678 --> 00:55:05,580
"If you can go barefoot for
your friends, can't I do it for you?"

450
00:55:07,851 --> 00:55:10,411
Almost everyone prays to God
for himself...

451
00:55:10,787 --> 00:55:12,982
but rare are those who
pray for others

452
00:55:13,991 --> 00:55:18,985
So let's go to a place where there
is no dress code or formalities

453
00:55:20,097 --> 00:55:23,191
"You must be visiting Malaysia
very often, isn't it?"

454
00:55:25,002 --> 00:55:26,594
For both actually

455
00:55:27,004 --> 00:55:28,995
"It's a beautiful city, isn't it?"

456
00:55:30,707 --> 00:55:32,265
Will you have an ice-cream?

457
00:55:32,676 --> 00:55:36,942
"Look, the lunch was on you. So let me
buy the ice-cream. I'll be back!"

458
00:55:40,217 --> 00:55:43,618
My feet... they're burning!

459
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:18,787
My heart is convinced...

460
00:56:21,892 --> 00:56:27,990
I've fallen in love with you

461
00:56:41,745 --> 00:56:44,009
"Ever since I have met you,
my love..."

462
00:56:44,347 --> 00:56:46,474
"I've known what it means
to fall in love"

463
00:56:46,817 --> 00:56:49,615
Your charm has driven me crazy

464
00:56:50,387 --> 00:56:51,649
Crazy

465
00:56:58,795 --> 00:57:01,286
My heart is convinced...

466
00:57:01,698 --> 00:57:03,757
I've fallen in love with you

467
00:57:04,101 --> 00:57:06,661
"Ever since I have met you,
my love..."

468
00:57:07,003 --> 00:57:09,494
"I've known what it means
to fall in love"

469
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,536
Your charm has driven me crazy

470
00:57:18,749 --> 00:57:21,309
My heart is convinced...

471
00:57:21,685 --> 00:57:23,744
I've fallen in love with you

472
00:57:24,187 --> 00:57:26,712
"Ever since I have met you,
my love..."

473
00:57:27,057 --> 00:57:29,423
"I've known what it means
to fall in love"

474
00:57:29,993 --> 00:57:32,723
Those eyes have driven me crazy

475
00:58:15,739 --> 00:58:18,640
My heart gave me no time to think

476
00:58:21,545 --> 00:58:24,173
"I don't know when
I fell in love"

477
00:58:27,217 --> 00:58:29,651
"My destiny, you came to shape..."

478
00:58:29,986 --> 00:58:32,784
"may our love not
attract the evil eye"

479
00:58:35,692 --> 00:58:38,320
"Ever since I have met you,
my love..."

480
00:58:38,795 --> 00:58:40,922
"I've known what it means
to fall in love"

481
00:58:41,298 --> 00:58:44,131
Your eyes have driven me crazy

482
00:58:44,467 --> 00:58:46,765
My heart is convinced...

483
00:58:47,137 --> 00:58:49,196
I've fallen in love with you

484
00:58:50,006 --> 00:58:52,566
My heart is convinced...

485
00:58:53,009 --> 00:58:55,637
I've fallen in love with you

486
00:59:21,605 --> 00:59:23,903
Take my heart away...

487
00:59:38,855 --> 00:59:41,983
"You are my peace,
you are my happiness..."

488
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,789
"you are the desire
of my heart"

489
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,662
You are my dawn...

490
00:59:53,003 --> 00:59:55,665
you are what I am known for

491
00:59:58,842 --> 01:00:01,333
"Ever since I have met you,
my love..."

492
01:00:01,678 --> 01:00:03,669
"I've known what it means
to fall in love"

493
01:00:04,014 --> 01:00:07,006
Your charm has driven me crazy

494
01:00:31,775 --> 01:00:34,642
I'll see how you take
that dog on board!

495
01:00:34,978 --> 01:00:36,775
You call my John a dog?

496
01:00:37,113 --> 01:00:40,981
Call him a dog and I'll see that you
don't board the ship again. Get that?

497
01:00:41,284 --> 01:00:44,310
"All right, I'll call him John.
But if you take him on the ship..."

498
01:00:44,654 --> 01:00:47,452
I'll lodge a complaint against you.
- Why are you fighting?

499
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:49,782
What is the problem?
- The problem is her John

500
01:00:50,126 --> 01:00:52,594
He barks all night
and drives me up the wall

501
01:00:54,864 --> 01:00:57,355
You shouldn't say such things
about Mr John

502
01:00:57,701 --> 01:00:59,794
"Whatever it is, you must
sort it out amicably"

503
01:01:00,136 --> 01:01:04,470
What will I settle amicably?
He was at my feet yesterday...

504
01:01:04,808 --> 01:01:11,771
and he pissed on my trousers.
- He pissed on your trousers?

505
01:01:12,182 --> 01:01:15,583
He's the one who pissed
on my trousers

506
01:01:16,119 --> 01:01:20,351
You shouldn't be doing such things.
You can't piss on people's trousers

507
01:01:20,724 --> 01:01:24,387
I'm talking about the dog!
- You call my John a dog again?

508
01:01:24,728 --> 01:01:27,288
"Now, now... I admit,
what he did was wrong"

509
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:30,758
But you're calling her husband
a dog again and again. That is bad

510
01:01:31,668 --> 01:01:33,966
You think my husband
is a dog?

511
01:01:34,971 --> 01:01:39,237
"Not me, he's the one who said it.
Why're you angry with me?"

512
01:01:40,977 --> 01:01:43,639
"My name is Tommy, not John."

513
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:46,972
Tommy? So who's John?
- This is John

514
01:01:47,984 --> 01:01:50,578
A dog? On the ship?
- Yes

515
01:01:50,987 --> 01:01:53,421
Don't you know? Animals are
not allowed on the ship!

516
01:01:53,757 --> 01:01:56,783
That dog is not going on the vessel.
You think this is a ship for dogs?

517
01:01:57,127 --> 01:01:59,459
"If dogs were allowed,
there'd be dogs everywhere"

518
01:01:59,796 --> 01:02:03,357
"Dogs in the kitchen, in the disco,
in the rations... dogs everywhere!"

519
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:08,660
"If dogs fell in the water, how many
times would we stop the ship?"

520
01:02:09,005 --> 01:02:12,771
Every time a dog fell in the water?
- But why would a dog jump at all?

521
01:02:13,109 --> 01:02:15,634
And what if it did?

522
01:02:18,014 --> 01:02:21,006
You'll have your John in Singapore.
Understand?

523
01:02:21,518 --> 01:02:23,509
"Till then, help yourself
to this Tommy"

524
01:03:30,019 --> 01:03:30,951
Number eight

525
01:03:31,287 --> 01:03:33,278
"Don't gamble anymore, Karan"

526
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:42,461
"Luck doesn't seem to be on your side.
- You're right, sir"

527
01:03:43,666 --> 01:03:45,657
"Ever since I've arrived,
I've only been losing"

528
01:03:46,970 --> 01:03:49,768
Here's a tip. Start every game
with lady-luck

529
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:52,973
You'll never lose.
- Really?

530
01:04:30,013 --> 01:04:32,413
"Sir, you've made a blunder
by giving me that tip!"

531
01:04:32,749 --> 01:04:35,741
"I'm going to win your whole casino now!
- That won't help, Karan"

532
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:38,280
Lady-luck is very much like love

533
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:40,953
It goes to the one
who approaches it first

534
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:46,360
"Priya, have you ever tried
your hand at Black Jack?"

535
01:04:47,964 --> 01:04:49,761
"Come on, I'll show it to you"

536
01:04:55,672 --> 01:04:59,699
"Karan, looks like you can't notice it.
But I can see it. Priya is changing"

537
01:05:00,043 --> 01:05:03,672
Oh no. I have all
the faith in Priya

538
01:05:31,708 --> 01:05:33,699
I thought you had forgotten

539
01:05:35,945 --> 01:05:39,437
"I sure had forgotten,
but it wasn't your birthday"

540
01:05:39,949 --> 01:05:42,611
"I had forgotten that life
isn't only about a future..."

541
01:05:42,952 --> 01:05:44,943
it's about the present too

542
01:05:45,955 --> 01:05:47,286
For you

543
01:05:50,693 --> 01:05:52,684
I got it specially for you
from Malaysia

544
01:05:54,664 --> 01:05:56,655
Now wear it quickly
and come to the deck

545
01:05:56,966 --> 01:05:58,957
We'll celebrate your birthday there

546
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:30,024
How did you get to know
that today is my birthday?

547
01:06:30,633 --> 01:06:33,625
Your passport told me.
Come on

548
01:06:34,003 --> 01:06:37,632
Karan and the others are awaiting me...
- They'll soon join us. Come on

549
01:07:35,598 --> 01:07:38,590
"Darshan, go and fetch the rest
of the members from Priya's troupe"

550
01:07:42,638 --> 01:07:44,503
The cake has arrived!

551
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:50,404
Here you guys are and I've looked
for you all over the ship!

552
01:07:50,747 --> 01:07:53,272
The boss has sent for you. Come on!
- It's Priya's birthday today

553
01:07:53,616 --> 01:07:55,607
We'll come immediately after
we have cut the cake

554
01:07:55,952 --> 01:07:59,285
Priya's at the Belle Vista and
the boss has thrown a huge party...

555
01:07:59,622 --> 01:08:02,284
to celebrate her birthday.
He has invited everybody on board!

556
01:08:52,308 --> 01:08:54,469
You must first feed the cake
to the members of your troupe

557
01:08:54,811 --> 01:08:56,802
They're the closest to you

558
01:08:57,079 --> 01:08:59,513
"Right now, you're the one who's
closest to Priya, sir"

559
01:09:00,716 --> 01:09:05,676
And we're only happy that you have
thrown such a grand party for her

560
01:09:09,025 --> 01:09:13,689
"Karan, sing a song that will bring
every lover closer to his beloved"

561
01:09:14,197 --> 01:09:16,188
And those who have still not
professed their love...

562
01:09:16,532 --> 01:09:18,523
must find themselves
speaking their heart

563
01:09:21,904 --> 01:09:23,701
"Sir, I'll sing a song today..."

564
01:09:24,173 --> 01:09:27,040
which every lover will
always remember

565
01:09:47,997 --> 01:09:50,488
Fall in love...

566
01:09:52,735 --> 01:09:55,704
express love...

567
01:09:57,673 --> 01:10:00,506
reciprocate love...

568
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:05,413
or deny love...

569
01:10:05,848 --> 01:10:09,614
"whatever punishment you
choose to give..."

570
01:10:11,587 --> 01:10:19,016
"giving you my heart
is fun in itself"

571
01:10:42,985 --> 01:10:46,216
"Fall in love,
express your love..."

572
01:10:46,556 --> 01:10:50,219
"reciprocate love
or deny me your love..."

573
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:54,587
"choose the punishment
you will give me"

574
01:10:54,997 --> 01:10:59,661
"Giving you my heart
is fun in itself"

575
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:20,810
"When you find someone
you love dearly..."

576
01:12:22,718 --> 01:12:29,021
"looking away from you,
you can't endure it"

577
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:34,191
Love drives you helpless

578
01:12:34,964 --> 01:12:38,127
"For it is an exchange
of hearts"

579
01:12:46,976 --> 01:12:50,639
"Strange is this game
of hearts..."

580
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:54,973
in its victory lies defeat

581
01:12:59,121 --> 01:13:02,557
Win it or lose it...

582
01:13:02,992 --> 01:13:06,120
this way or that...

583
01:13:06,529 --> 01:13:10,124
"choose the punishment
you will give me"

584
01:13:10,533 --> 01:13:15,800
"Giving you my heart
is fun in itself"

585
01:14:08,758 --> 01:14:11,784
I have now come to believe...

586
01:14:12,695 --> 01:14:15,789
I'm in love

587
01:14:16,766 --> 01:14:23,001
"For the first ever time,
I feel a sense of belonging"

588
01:14:25,007 --> 01:14:27,475
I must now have the one...

589
01:14:29,011 --> 01:14:32,105
my heart has desired

590
01:14:41,056 --> 01:14:44,617
"Who will gain?
And who will lose?"

591
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:48,953
Who knows what destiny holds

592
01:14:53,235 --> 01:15:00,334
"Whatever destiny offers me,
my beloved is with me"

593
01:15:00,709 --> 01:15:04,338
Whatever God wishes...

594
01:15:04,713 --> 01:15:09,980
"giving you my heart
is fun in itself"

595
01:15:16,759 --> 01:15:21,992
"Giving you my heart
is fun in itself"

596
01:15:42,952 --> 01:15:46,217
I still can't believe that was
my birthday celebration

597
01:15:46,655 --> 01:15:49,488
I've never ever seen such a grand
celebration in my life!

598
01:15:49,959 --> 01:15:54,419
"However, there was something lacking.
I didn't give you a birthday gift"

599
01:16:04,974 --> 01:16:08,637
"Priya, I wish to marry you"

600
01:16:12,047 --> 01:16:15,983
"Should you wear this ring,
I'll think you have accepted me"

601
01:16:17,086 --> 01:16:19,748
"Otherwise, you may keep this ring
as your birthday gift"

602
01:16:21,991 --> 01:16:28,555
"Whatever you decide, I'll always
respect you as I respect you now"

603
01:16:33,669 --> 01:16:35,603
What are you thinking about?

604
01:16:37,673 --> 01:16:43,942
Just that some dreams do come true

605
01:17:26,989 --> 01:17:31,926
"Karan, Raj proposed to me today.
He wants to take me to Jaipur..."

606
01:17:32,261 --> 01:17:35,196
to meet his folks for the engagement

607
01:17:38,701 --> 01:17:40,601
And what did you say to him?

608
01:17:42,938 --> 01:17:44,929
I accepted his ring

609
01:17:52,681 --> 01:17:53,943
What?

610
01:17:55,951 --> 01:17:57,282
Yes Karan

611
01:18:01,457 --> 01:18:05,450
What are you talking about?
- It's true

612
01:18:14,737 --> 01:18:17,228
I can't believe our plan
has worked so soon!

613
01:18:29,985 --> 01:18:32,647
"I'm so happy...
I'm so happy, Karan!"

614
01:18:59,181 --> 01:19:04,209
My grandmother means everything to me.
I never hide anything from her

615
01:19:04,753 --> 01:19:08,120
"Before I proposed to you,
I told her about us"

616
01:19:08,524 --> 01:19:10,515
She wanted to take
a quick look at you

617
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:18,993
What are you wondering?
- Only... will your family accept me?

618
01:19:24,907 --> 01:19:27,705
"Papa, when is Raj Uncle bringing
my new Aunt?"

619
01:19:28,043 --> 01:19:29,908
Should be here soon

620
01:19:30,212 --> 01:19:32,510
Raj is here

621
01:19:45,994 --> 01:19:47,256
Welcome Priya

622
01:19:52,935 --> 01:19:54,061
I'm fine

623
01:19:54,403 --> 01:19:55,802
Uncle...
- Bless you

624
01:19:56,138 --> 01:19:58,470
"How are you?
- Fine. Uncle, this is Priya"

625
01:19:59,675 --> 01:20:01,609
Enough my child.
May you be happy

626
01:20:01,944 --> 01:20:04,174
Priya this is Prithvi. My cousin.
- Namaste (Greetings)

627
01:20:04,513 --> 01:20:06,538
Let's go inside. Come...

628
01:20:09,852 --> 01:20:11,843
How are you grandma?
- I'm all right

629
01:20:13,956 --> 01:20:15,685
"May you be happy, my child"

630
01:20:25,901 --> 01:20:28,699
"Aunt, won't you introduce Priya?
- Why not?"

631
01:20:29,037 --> 01:20:30,698
I'm your aunt.
- Namaste

632
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:33,564
Bless you. Nidhi is my daughter-in-law.
- Namaste

633
01:20:33,909 --> 01:20:35,570
"These three...
- One minute, Mummy"

634
01:20:35,911 --> 01:20:38,379
Let us introduce ourselves.
I'm Ashu

635
01:20:38,714 --> 01:20:40,579
I'm Kiran.
- And I am Neha

636
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:45,380
No one introduced me to my Aunt!
- But you don't want to see her

637
01:20:45,721 --> 01:20:48,918
Didn't you say so?
- Because Aunt Kiran told us...

638
01:20:49,258 --> 01:20:53,718
that the new aunt has
big claws and big eyes

639
01:20:55,731 --> 01:20:57,926
"Kiran, take Priya inside"

640
01:21:03,605 --> 01:21:04,594
Raj my son...
- Yes?

641
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:08,569
"Wait, I must talk to you.
- Sure, grandma"

642
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,549
Yes and no won't do.
You're going to give us the details

643
01:21:21,890 --> 01:21:26,691
How did you meet him?
- Was it love at first sight?

644
01:21:28,597 --> 01:21:33,000
Love-at-first-sight happens only
in novels and films. Not in real life

645
01:21:33,635 --> 01:21:38,572
As if you majored in love-life.
- At first sight...

646
01:21:38,907 --> 01:21:41,569
Priya must've bowled him over

647
01:21:45,847 --> 01:21:48,577
The children will be
your responsibility

648
01:21:48,917 --> 01:21:49,576
Sure

649
01:21:49,918 --> 01:21:51,909
"Namaste, grandma.
- Come Priya, sit"

650
01:21:52,054 --> 01:21:54,079
You may leave.
I'll make tea

651
01:21:58,694 --> 01:22:04,326
"Allow me...
- No, guests may not"

652
01:22:07,936 --> 01:22:11,929
"Priya, you aren't getting engaged
to Raj"

653
01:22:15,944 --> 01:22:18,936
"Not only my decision,
Raj has concurred too"

654
01:22:21,283 --> 01:22:28,382
I've decided. No engagement.
The wedding is on the 5th of this month

655
01:22:32,894 --> 01:22:36,386
"For the next six months,
there are no dates"

656
01:22:38,567 --> 01:22:42,469
What are you thinking?
If you have any reservations...

657
01:22:42,904 --> 01:22:45,896
No grandma... as you wish

658
01:22:47,909 --> 01:22:49,501
"Come to me, my child"

659
01:22:53,615 --> 01:22:56,083
Nidhi... cast away the evil eye

660
01:23:27,749 --> 01:23:32,413
Your eyes will tell a tale...

661
01:23:33,221 --> 01:23:37,555
"once, you and I are together"

662
01:23:40,429 --> 01:23:41,828
Come with me...

663
01:23:42,864 --> 01:23:45,162
"Come on, I'll give
you the time of your life"

664
01:24:21,670 --> 01:24:26,539
"There are no villains
in our love story"

665
01:24:27,542 --> 01:24:31,672
"And no tearjerkers,
no jealousies"

666
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:36,412
"Fun for all time to come,
and lots of love..."

667
01:24:37,419 --> 01:24:41,480
"and lots of kissing
and lots of horseplay"

668
01:24:41,923 --> 01:24:46,951
"You're going to make tongues wag,
you're going to make heads turn..."

669
01:24:47,429 --> 01:24:51,923
"once, you and I are together"

670
01:24:54,436 --> 01:24:56,233
Come with me...

671
01:24:57,372 --> 01:24:59,363
"Come on, I'll give
you the time of your life"

672
01:25:42,017 --> 01:25:46,420
I'm delighted for you

673
01:25:46,822 --> 01:25:51,020
"You remind me
of your grandfather"

674
01:25:51,426 --> 01:25:55,920
"Make him proud,
carry forth the family"

675
01:25:56,431 --> 01:26:00,765
"When your bride is cross,
woo her with love"

676
01:26:01,169 --> 01:26:03,160
"Grandma, that makes sense"

677
01:26:03,505 --> 01:26:05,939
Your grandson is no less a man

678
01:26:06,441 --> 01:26:11,071
"Next year, you're going to have
a great-grandson, I promise"

679
01:26:13,882 --> 01:26:16,373
"Come on, I'll give
you the time of your life"

680
01:27:04,432 --> 01:27:08,425
Shy? As if you're seeing me
for the first time?

681
01:27:19,447 --> 01:27:25,443
"If you're so shy, how am I going to
fulfill the promise I made to grandma?"

682
01:27:28,456 --> 01:27:32,017
What happened?
Why are you so apprehensive?

683
01:27:35,163 --> 01:27:40,760
"Raj, I must tell you something.
- Tonight isn't for talking"

684
01:27:41,636 --> 01:27:46,471
"Tonight is for love.
Whatever it is, tell me quickly"

685
01:27:47,709 --> 01:27:52,476
When I saw you for the first time
I took a liking to you

686
01:27:53,682 --> 01:27:58,016
Then you came close to me
and I went mad with joy

687
01:27:59,187 --> 01:28:04,181
Then you proposed to me
and my every dream came true

688
01:28:06,795 --> 01:28:11,755
But your status
made me conscious of mine

689
01:28:13,134 --> 01:28:17,434
"I was always apprehensive,
lest I lose you"

690
01:28:19,374 --> 01:28:23,708
"So I swore to myself,
I took an oath"

691
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:31,779
"If I ever married you, for a month
after the marriage, I'd stay a virgin"

692
01:28:39,361 --> 01:28:43,798
"For me, it's a vow.
But if it's against your wishes..."

693
01:28:44,265 --> 01:28:47,462
"I won't stop you,
because I am your wife"

694
01:28:48,637 --> 01:28:51,470
How could you imagine
I wouldn't heed you?

695
01:28:52,273 --> 01:28:55,140
We are man and wife.
Decisions we take about our lives...

696
01:28:55,477 --> 01:28:59,004
"aren't yours or mine only,
these decisions are ours"

697
01:29:01,316 --> 01:29:05,582
"I consider myself fortunate,
ours has been a union of hearts"

698
01:29:07,322 --> 01:29:10,758
"For consummation, we have
a whole life ahead of us"

699
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:17,088
"If we're married, maybe
it's because of your vow"

700
01:29:37,452 --> 01:29:39,443
"Karan, this is Priya.
- Is everything all right?"

701
01:29:39,788 --> 01:29:44,122
Why aren't you returning my calls?
- I got married yesterday

702
01:29:44,459 --> 01:29:49,453
"Your idea about the vow worked.
He agreed, he didn't even touch me"

703
01:29:51,466 --> 01:29:54,128
I was sure it'd work!
Back in Malaysia...

704
01:29:54,469 --> 01:29:57,131
that's just why I told you
not to wear shoes

705
01:29:57,639 --> 01:30:00,665
I've taken just a big step
because I trust you

706
01:30:01,176 --> 01:30:03,701
Now wait and watch
how I work out a divorce

707
01:30:04,212 --> 01:30:08,615
And with all that money...
all our dreams will come true

708
01:30:10,418 --> 01:30:14,184
When are you coming back to Mumbai?
- As soon as the rituals are over

709
01:30:14,589 --> 01:30:17,422
Someone's coming.
I'm hanging up

710
01:30:22,564 --> 01:30:25,431
You're becoming a billionaire

711
01:30:27,202 --> 01:30:28,430
Wonderful plan

712
01:30:29,137 --> 01:30:34,097
Looks just like yesterday... when you
joined our troupe. And in no time...

713
01:30:34,442 --> 01:30:40,108
you were our leader. Then you seduced
the loveliest girl in the troupe

714
01:30:40,448 --> 01:30:45,442
"And Priya, so blindly in love
so blind to all else"

715
01:30:46,621 --> 01:30:50,853
Then you got her to seduce
Raj Singhania. And he married her

716
01:30:51,192 --> 01:30:55,185
"Next, you're going to have her divorced.
Priya will receive millions in alimony"

717
01:30:55,530 --> 01:30:59,022
You're about to become a billionaire.
Won't you make me a millionaire?

718
01:30:59,567 --> 01:31:02,798
Are you blackmailing me?
- Am I blackmailing you?

719
01:31:03,138 --> 01:31:07,074
"No, I'm only asking for my share.
5 million is all that I want"

720
01:31:07,408 --> 01:31:09,774
2.5 for withholding information
from Raj Singhania

721
01:31:10,111 --> 01:31:14,013
2.5 for saving you from the police.
- Police?

722
01:31:14,415 --> 01:31:21,753
Only I know about Jojo Fernandes.
It was no accident. You killed him

723
01:31:25,293 --> 01:31:28,091
"That night, you were so depressed
when you left. I followed you..."

724
01:31:28,429 --> 01:31:31,330
"thinking you might commit suicide.
Instead, you killed him"

725
01:31:32,934 --> 01:31:38,099
I thought you killed Jojo to ensure
that we kept the contract. I kept mum

726
01:31:38,439 --> 01:31:41,431
But I know better.
You did it for your gain

727
01:31:42,443 --> 01:31:48,678
"All right, you'll get the money.
But only after Priya's divorce"

728
01:31:49,017 --> 01:31:55,445
"No, I want the money in 15 days.
Clever as you are, you'll find a way"

729
01:32:11,306 --> 01:32:14,070
You serve grandma.
I'll serve the rest of them

730
01:32:15,710 --> 01:32:17,405
"Come, sit"

731
01:32:19,214 --> 01:32:25,414
"For the first time, you have cooked
in my kitchen. You must feed me"

732
01:32:30,425 --> 01:32:35,124
Wonderful! I hope you fill Raj's life
with such sweetness

733
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:48,438
"Bless you, my child"

734
01:32:54,249 --> 01:33:00,381
"In our family, brides and sons
are equals. It's a family tradition"

735
01:33:04,392 --> 01:33:06,383
Thank you.
- May you be happy

736
01:33:10,398 --> 01:33:14,391
Shares of the Singhania Group
of Companies. Worth 5 billion

737
01:33:14,736 --> 01:33:16,863
"From now, you own these shares"

738
01:33:25,179 --> 01:33:30,082
"Not only Raj's life partner, you're
a partner of the Singhania empire"

739
01:33:30,418 --> 01:33:34,821
I'm certain that you will discharge
this responsibility with diligence

740
01:33:56,344 --> 01:33:57,834
Our house

741
01:34:05,486 --> 01:34:10,719
"Karan! Someday we'll own
a huge bungalow, several cars..."

742
01:34:11,092 --> 01:34:13,060
we'll have everything

743
01:34:14,395 --> 01:34:16,056
How do you like it?

744
01:34:18,399 --> 01:34:22,495
Just like it was in my dreams

745
01:34:58,940 --> 01:35:01,773
No one got wind of your wedding.
How come?

746
01:35:02,110 --> 01:35:04,169
This party is meant
to inform everyone

747
01:35:07,382 --> 01:35:11,375
After he has met his guests

748
01:35:17,392 --> 01:35:20,054
Holding him here
would've been troublesome for you

749
01:35:28,403 --> 01:35:32,066
No one from your troupe in tow?
- The troupe is gone

750
01:35:32,407 --> 01:35:39,074
"Your boss has married our star.
- Something to be happy about, no?"

751
01:35:39,414 --> 01:35:43,407
A small-time dancer is married
to such a big man

752
01:35:43,951 --> 01:35:47,409
"So, stay away from Priya.
You might break her home"

753
01:35:49,157 --> 01:35:52,092
How come?
- If she sees you...

754
01:35:52,427 --> 01:35:57,763
she will take pity and she will
consider going back to the troupe

755
01:35:58,099 --> 01:36:00,363
Think! She's a rich man's wife!
And how will he feel...

756
01:36:00,701 --> 01:36:05,035
if she goes dancing in your troupe?
The relationship will get strained

757
01:36:05,373 --> 01:36:10,037
"One-upmanship, guilt complexes?
Fights, quarrels, police, divorce..."

758
01:36:10,378 --> 01:36:14,712
you'll wreck her home...
do you want to wreck her home?

759
01:36:15,083 --> 01:36:17,608
Try to understand.
- I've come to congratulate her

760
01:36:18,386 --> 01:36:20,047
To congratulate her?

761
01:36:20,388 --> 01:36:23,380
What if it ends up in a homewreck?

762
01:36:25,259 --> 01:36:29,855
You must be wondering
why I haven't brought you a gift?

763
01:36:30,198 --> 01:36:33,099
You owe me two months' rent.
Consider it my gift

764
01:36:48,116 --> 01:36:50,550
Many-many happy returns

765
01:36:54,222 --> 01:36:56,952
Here's Karan I told you about

766
01:36:58,426 --> 01:37:01,418
Were it not for him
Priya wouldn't have come into my life

767
01:37:02,430 --> 01:37:05,422
"Raj, tell us how you felt when
you saw Priya for the first time"

768
01:37:07,235 --> 01:37:08,998
That first meeting...

769
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:14,131
I couldn't take my eyes of her

770
01:37:14,609 --> 01:37:16,770
And all I could think of was...

771
01:37:19,013 --> 01:37:23,609
I'd bear a grouse if there was
anyone else like her on earth

772
01:37:25,453 --> 01:37:30,652
I'd bear a grouse if there was
anyone else who liked her

773
01:37:37,064 --> 01:37:40,158
Now that you're married
what's the feeling like?

774
01:37:43,671 --> 01:37:44,797
May I?

775
01:38:01,422 --> 01:38:04,084
You walked into my life...

776
01:38:04,425 --> 01:38:07,417
and my life...

777
01:38:09,730 --> 01:38:12,563
oh how you changed my life

778
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:22,437
With your love...

779
01:38:26,447 --> 01:38:29,575
you changed my life

780
01:39:00,214 --> 01:39:02,739
No more can I bear...

781
01:39:03,117 --> 01:39:05,142
anyone else...

782
01:39:05,586 --> 01:39:11,081
"who'd die for you, as I'd die"

783
01:39:17,164 --> 01:39:19,155
"No, not even a touch..."

784
01:39:19,433 --> 01:39:22,095
I cannot even bear...

785
01:39:22,436 --> 01:39:27,999
"to hear someone else
talking about you"

786
01:39:36,450 --> 01:39:39,010
You came close to me...

787
01:39:39,453 --> 01:39:42,445
and my life...

788
01:39:44,525 --> 01:39:47,688
oh how you have changed my life

789
01:40:23,931 --> 01:40:29,096
"If even the mirror
praises your beauty..."

790
01:40:29,437 --> 01:40:34,431
I'd feel like smashing mirrors too

791
01:40:40,614 --> 01:40:45,950
"You are my obsession,
in you I find my peace"

792
01:40:46,354 --> 01:40:51,621
"I'm crazy about you,
and I don't care who says what"

793
01:41:00,267 --> 01:41:04,397
You drove me crazy...

794
01:41:08,476 --> 01:41:11,411
and you changed my life forever

795
01:41:17,051 --> 01:41:19,417
You walked into my life...

796
01:41:19,754 --> 01:41:22,746
and my life...

797
01:41:25,326 --> 01:41:28,420
"oh how you have changed
my life forever"

798
01:42:12,406 --> 01:42:15,068
"What a wife! Newly-wedded brides
wake up early, they make tea..."

799
01:42:15,409 --> 01:42:19,072
then they wake their husbands.
And you?

800
01:42:20,114 --> 01:42:23,641
I'll make tea right away.
- I was just joking

801
01:42:25,119 --> 01:42:27,053
"Every morning, I want only..."

802
01:42:29,423 --> 01:42:34,190
"Curfew on kisses too?
Well, never mind"

803
01:42:35,196 --> 01:42:39,132
"It's a matter of only a fortnight.
Afterwards, I want a handsome son"

804
01:42:40,434 --> 01:42:44,131
And a daughter... just like you.
Followed by...

805
01:42:44,572 --> 01:42:47,439
maybe a cricket
or football team?

806
01:42:49,443 --> 01:42:54,540
It's a matter of only a fortnight.
I want a handsome son and a daughter

807
01:43:16,403 --> 01:43:19,497
Welcome Mrs Singhania!
I've been wondering how to meet you

808
01:43:19,874 --> 01:43:21,808
Karan! We must speak!
- Step inside first

809
01:43:22,176 --> 01:43:26,203
Look! Isn't that the kind
of house we always dreamt about?

810
01:43:26,547 --> 01:43:30,916
"Huge lawn in front,
six-or-seven-roomed, sea-facing"

811
01:43:31,418 --> 01:43:34,216
They guy who owns it will sell out
for just a 100 million

812
01:43:34,588 --> 01:43:38,217
"After your divorce, we're going to be
rich! This house will be our first buy"

813
01:43:38,626 --> 01:43:43,222
But how will it come to be?
Raj loves me dearly

814
01:43:43,898 --> 01:43:47,095
After the wedding I was to start
quarreling with him

815
01:43:47,434 --> 01:43:50,562
But what am I to say?
- You needn't do a thing

816
01:43:50,905 --> 01:43:54,432
I've got a lawyer working
on your divorce already

817
01:43:55,342 --> 01:43:57,776
"We're going to court, claiming that
after a fortnight of being married..."

818
01:43:58,112 --> 01:44:00,046
you're still a virgin

819
01:44:01,248 --> 01:44:05,878
"All you got to prove in court is,
your husband Raj Singhania is impotent"

820
01:44:16,330 --> 01:44:20,790
No reason to quarrel. I think you
won't even have to go to court

821
01:44:21,201 --> 01:44:25,399
Raj Singhania would never want his
family affairs brought out in public

822
01:44:26,407 --> 01:44:29,399
He will pre-empt you from going to
court. He will give you a divorce

823
01:44:33,414 --> 01:44:36,542
Be here at two tomorrow to sign
the papers. I'll handle the rest

824
01:44:37,751 --> 01:44:42,415
"We claim that after a fortnight of
being married, you're still a virgin"

825
01:44:43,290 --> 01:44:48,421
It's a matter of only a fortnight.
I want a handsome son and a daughter

826
01:44:50,631 --> 01:44:55,330
"All you got to prove in court is,
your husband Raj Singhania is impotent"

827
01:45:50,324 --> 01:45:52,087
Is everything all right?

828
01:45:52,426 --> 01:45:57,090
We suspect an internal injury
in the cranial area

829
01:45:57,431 --> 01:46:02,027
But we are unable to confirm it yet.
In the next 24 hours...

830
01:46:02,369 --> 01:46:05,532
"unless she comes around,
she might slip into a coma"

831
01:47:20,681 --> 01:47:25,448
"All you got to prove in court is,
your husband Raj Singhania is impotent"

832
01:47:27,454 --> 01:47:28,944
He's impotent

833
01:47:30,491 --> 01:47:34,791
Raj Singhania would never want his
family affairs brought out in public

834
01:47:35,129 --> 01:47:37,597
He will pre-empt you from going to
court. He will give you a divorce

835
01:47:45,472 --> 01:47:48,236
Your wife has come around

836
01:47:56,483 --> 01:47:58,144
You're perfectly all right now

837
01:47:59,019 --> 01:48:03,615
"Doctor, where is my husband?
- Ever since you were brought in..."

838
01:48:03,957 --> 01:48:07,484
he has been here. Last night
he seemed quite anxious for you

839
01:48:14,134 --> 01:48:15,931
How is my wife now?

840
01:48:16,436 --> 01:48:20,839
She has also cleared all the tests.
Shock was the reason for the blackout

841
01:48:21,175 --> 01:48:25,441
You may take her home.
All she needs is rest

842
01:48:45,332 --> 01:48:50,031
"You look relaxed, you've slept
through the last 24 hours"

843
01:48:58,345 --> 01:48:59,903
Are you all right?

844
01:49:01,582 --> 01:49:03,106
I'm fine

845
01:49:03,617 --> 01:49:07,610
"Then I'll tell the doctor,
I'm carrying my bride home right away"

846
01:49:30,944 --> 01:49:36,109
Wonderful! You can't even cross
a street? What were you upto?

847
01:49:36,450 --> 01:49:39,749
Thanks to your accident
everything is undone

848
01:49:41,021 --> 01:49:43,455
By now Raj would've been delivered
the notice. It's all gone haywire now

849
01:49:43,790 --> 01:49:45,621
All because of you

850
01:49:47,227 --> 01:49:49,855
"Not for once, have you asked me
how I am"

851
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:53,592
Why are you talking like this?
You think I don't care for you?

852
01:49:53,967 --> 01:49:56,458
"Whatever I'm doing,
is for your sake, darling"

853
01:49:58,472 --> 01:50:03,034
Now forget all this and get well soon.
And come over to sign the papers

854
01:50:06,546 --> 01:50:08,480
Now take rest. I'm leaving

855
01:50:17,224 --> 01:50:19,215
"Yes Harry, tell me.
- 15 days are over"

856
01:50:19,559 --> 01:50:21,618
Are you paying up?
Or do I go to Raj Singhania?

857
01:50:21,962 --> 01:50:25,830
You don't know about Priya's accident?
- Find someone else for giving excuses

858
01:50:26,166 --> 01:50:28,828
Dilly-dallying over instalment one?
What happens to full-and-final payment?

859
01:50:29,169 --> 01:50:33,037
What instalment? 50 million was agreed.
- Past tense

860
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:37,308
50 million is first instalment.
I'll settle full-and-final later

861
01:50:37,711 --> 01:50:41,442
"And listen, this evening I'm at
the gym. Get the cash and come over"

862
01:50:50,157 --> 01:50:51,454
Bad times

863
01:51:36,436 --> 01:51:38,427
That was instalment one

864
01:51:40,340 --> 01:51:42,638
And here's full-and-final settlement

865
01:52:22,416 --> 01:52:28,912
"Mr Raj Singhania isn't in the office,
leave your message after the beep"

866
01:52:30,424 --> 01:52:37,830
"Mr Singhania, this is Harry.
Karan just tried to kill me"

867
01:52:38,432 --> 01:52:43,028
Priya is in league with him and they
are about to con you out of your money

868
01:52:43,437 --> 01:52:47,100
Karan killed Jojo Fernandes
right in front of my eyes

869
01:52:47,441 --> 01:52:51,138
By the time you get this message
I might be dead

870
01:54:07,721 --> 01:54:10,588
How are you feeling now?
- I'm fine

871
01:54:10,924 --> 01:54:15,156
I'll take breakfast
at the dining table with Raj

872
01:54:15,495 --> 01:54:18,521
But Mr Raj isn't having breakfast.
- Why?

873
01:54:18,865 --> 01:54:22,733
I don't know. He hasn't eaten anything
these last two days

874
01:54:30,410 --> 01:54:32,401
Hi Priya... come

875
01:54:34,581 --> 01:54:37,573
Mrs Braganza was saying that you
haven't eaten in the last two days

876
01:54:39,419 --> 01:54:41,979
"Forget about me. Tell me,
how are you feeling?"

877
01:54:42,422 --> 01:54:45,016
You haven't answered my question

878
01:54:52,432 --> 01:54:55,924
If you can keep such a tough vow
for my sake...

879
01:54:57,170 --> 01:55:00,628
"for your sake,
can I not go hungry for a few days?"

880
01:55:06,479 --> 01:55:12,384
"When I saw you in the hospital
lying senseless, I was afraid..."

881
01:55:14,387 --> 01:55:16,787
I'd lose you

882
01:55:19,392 --> 01:55:25,797
"I was desperate... and I thought...
why not give it a try, your way?"

883
01:55:29,302 --> 01:55:35,070
And look... here you are with me
in the pink of health

884
01:55:41,881 --> 01:55:48,013
"Tell me...
all about love..."

885
01:55:48,421 --> 01:55:54,417
"what relationships
are all about"

886
01:55:57,831 --> 01:56:01,164
You have made me realise...

887
01:56:01,368 --> 01:56:04,826
and my life...

888
01:56:07,540 --> 01:56:11,374
oh how you've changed my life

889
02:00:31,104 --> 02:00:32,765
Put Priya on the line

890
02:00:32,906 --> 02:00:37,434
She has gone to see Dr Joshi.
- Why what's wrong? Is she all right?

891
02:00:37,844 --> 02:00:41,439
"She's fine, but she mentioned
a routine check-up"

892
02:00:50,323 --> 02:00:53,986
"I've been waiting for you forever!
Come on, the divorce papers are ready"

893
02:00:54,527 --> 02:00:58,793
Only your signature is needed.
- I haven't come to sign the papers

894
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:04,063
I won't do the mistakes
we were about to commit

895
02:01:06,739 --> 02:01:10,402
What are you saying?
- I can't deceive Raj

896
02:01:12,812 --> 02:01:17,215
What's come over you all of a sudden?
Do you sympathise with Raj?

897
02:01:17,884 --> 02:01:20,409
He has enough money. Even if
we take away a billion or two...

898
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:23,751
"it won't make a difference to him.
- This isn't about money, Karan"

899
02:01:24,324 --> 02:01:27,088
It's about trust that
husband reposes in wife

900
02:01:27,493 --> 02:01:30,621
I cannot betray
my husband's trust

901
02:01:31,431 --> 02:01:32,762
Husband?

902
02:01:35,435 --> 02:01:39,098
A few sweet nothings...

903
02:01:39,439 --> 02:01:44,035
and he becomes your husband?
- He became my husband...

904
02:01:44,310 --> 02:01:47,438
"the day I married him,
even if it was for deceit"

905
02:01:48,214 --> 02:01:51,706
Now I realise how significant
those marriage vows are

906
02:01:52,619 --> 02:01:58,057
"What about the promises you gave me?
- Yes, promises between lovers"

907
02:01:58,458 --> 02:02:01,188
"Now I stand before you,
another man's wife"

908
02:02:08,067 --> 02:02:11,400
I'm so close to success!
You can't betray me now

909
02:02:11,904 --> 02:02:15,067
You must divorce Raj.
- I can't...

910
02:02:15,274 --> 02:02:17,742
"You got to do it, baby"

911
02:02:18,411 --> 02:02:22,609
You can't ruin me like this

912
02:02:24,617 --> 02:02:29,418
"Look at me.
You love me, it's me you desire"

913
02:02:30,423 --> 02:02:32,084
No Karan

914
02:02:32,525 --> 02:02:39,089
I'm in love with Raj.
I'd die rather than divorce him

915
02:03:22,308 --> 02:03:24,572
"I'm leaving, Karan"

916
02:03:24,811 --> 02:03:26,802
Wait Priya

917
02:03:27,413 --> 02:03:30,007
"Forgive me, I've been selfish"

918
02:03:31,851 --> 02:03:34,684
So what if I didn't realise
my dreams?

919
02:03:37,423 --> 02:03:40,415
All your dreams have come true

920
02:03:46,432 --> 02:03:49,833
"After this day, I shall never
come between you and Raj"

921
02:03:50,436 --> 02:03:54,429
"If you are happy with Raj,
then I'm happy for your sake"

922
02:04:06,385 --> 02:04:10,378
"Harry, I can't give you
the 5 million"

923
02:04:11,991 --> 02:04:15,154
Try to understand...
Priya isn't getting divorced

924
02:04:16,462 --> 02:04:19,124
How will Priya get hold
of so much money?

925
02:04:19,398 --> 02:04:22,799
I can't ask her
for her jewellery

926
02:04:24,003 --> 02:04:27,404
Harry! You aren't going to Raj!
Get it? No! You won't go to Raj

927
02:04:28,541 --> 02:04:33,672
"What happened?
- Priya, I hid something from you"

928
02:04:35,181 --> 02:04:41,916
Harry knows all about us. The cur!
He's blackmailing me for 5 million

929
02:04:43,589 --> 02:04:47,423
Unless he is paid by tomorrow
he's going to tell Raj everything

930
02:04:47,794 --> 02:04:51,594
What?
- Don't worry

931
02:04:52,431 --> 02:04:57,095
"I won't let him ruin your life,
and I'll do anything for that"

932
02:04:57,436 --> 02:05:01,770
No Karan! You'll do nothing wrong.
- Where will the money come from?

933
02:05:03,376 --> 02:05:06,277
"Wasn't Harry asking for jewellery?
- Yes, but I won't..."

934
02:05:06,379 --> 02:05:09,371
"Look, there's no other way out.
I'll be here at four tomorrow"

935
02:05:09,515 --> 02:05:11,506
With the jewellery

936
02:05:30,469 --> 02:05:33,404
"I've been waiting for you, for ages.
Your cellphone was switched off"

937
02:05:33,739 --> 02:05:38,267
Is everything all right?
- I went to see Dr Joshi

938
02:05:38,578 --> 02:05:42,912
Mr Braganza told me about the check-up.
Then I called him and he said...

939
02:05:43,082 --> 02:05:47,416
you never went there.
- I bumped into Uncle Rustom on the way

940
02:05:47,687 --> 02:05:53,023
He persuaded me to go home with him.
- So what's there to hide?

941
02:05:53,593 --> 02:05:59,361
Did you think I'd be angry about it?
Nothing about you can make me angry

942
02:06:01,367 --> 02:06:05,269
Over nothing at all?
- You speak as if...

943
02:06:05,404 --> 02:06:08,373
you have the darkest secrets
hidden away?

944
02:06:09,942 --> 02:06:13,105
No one can fathom a woman's heart

945
02:06:16,382 --> 02:06:20,375
"You are the only one in my heart,
only you"

946
02:06:29,195 --> 02:06:33,188
"Look Mr Rustomjee, this is an office.
You can't throw your weight around"

947
02:06:33,399 --> 02:06:36,391
"I'm not throwing my weight around,
I only want to see Raj"

948
02:06:36,636 --> 02:06:42,074
He won't have the time in 5 days
to talk to freeloaders like you

949
02:06:42,408 --> 02:06:45,275
What do you mean freeloaders?
Do you take me for a beggar?

950
02:06:46,579 --> 02:06:48,069
Move on

951
02:06:48,414 --> 02:06:51,008
You can't throw your weight around!
There he is...

952
02:06:51,417 --> 02:06:54,079
Hello Rustom Uncle...
- Raj my boy...

953
02:06:59,425 --> 02:07:01,757
"He was in his office,
must've been busy"

954
02:07:03,429 --> 02:07:04,691
Come Uncle

955
02:07:05,431 --> 02:07:09,197
"Sit, what will you have?
- Tea give me dysentery"

956
02:07:09,302 --> 02:07:13,432
Coffee gives me constipation.
And no cold drinks. Doctor's orders

957
02:07:13,606 --> 02:07:17,542
So I stick to the night-time whisky.
- And what brings you here?

958
02:07:17,877 --> 02:07:21,438
Having survived 30 years
of Shirin's bickerings...

959
02:07:21,614 --> 02:07:26,176
now I must celebrate the marriage
anniversary. Small party. On Tuesday

960
02:07:26,552 --> 02:07:30,113
I came to give you the invitation.
- Why did you take the trouble?

961
02:07:30,256 --> 02:07:32,315
Priya visited you yesterday.
You could've told her

962
02:07:32,491 --> 02:07:38,020
Yesterday? I've never seen her face
ever after you married her

963
02:07:39,565 --> 02:07:44,229
Priya said she visited you yesterday.
- Joking is a habit with her

964
02:07:44,570 --> 02:07:47,232
She must've been pulling your leg

965
02:07:49,275 --> 02:07:52,472
"Excuse me, I must leave
...lots more to invite"

966
02:08:19,705 --> 02:08:22,833
May I speak to Raj Singhania
- Your name?

967
02:08:31,584 --> 02:08:35,452
"There's a man who wants to talk about
your wife. Says, it's urgent"

968
02:08:36,956 --> 02:08:38,947
Put him on

969
02:08:40,593 --> 02:08:43,460
I want to pass on some information
about your wife

970
02:08:44,163 --> 02:08:46,961
Who are you?
- A well-wisher

971
02:08:47,867 --> 02:08:52,463
You wife is having an affair with
Karan. It began before you married her

972
02:08:53,472 --> 02:08:55,269
Don't disconnect

973
02:08:55,608 --> 02:08:58,475
"She's squandering your money,
she's giving it all away to him"

974
02:08:58,978 --> 02:09:02,414
"If you don't believe, go over
to Karan's house at 4pm today"

975
02:09:02,615 --> 02:09:04,742
You will find Priya in his arms

976
02:10:24,430 --> 02:10:26,762
"Priya, I'm so worried!
Harry called me again"

977
02:10:26,866 --> 02:10:28,697
All last night...

978
02:10:29,568 --> 02:10:33,095
I couldn't sleep... I was worried
...what if you never came?

979
02:10:53,559 --> 02:10:56,050
I'm leaving.
- Priya...

980
02:10:58,831 --> 02:11:01,391
My best wishes
for your new life

981
02:11:01,901 --> 02:11:07,806
"As for me, you will always live
in my heart... as a good friend"

982
02:11:24,089 --> 02:11:28,617
I went to see Dr Joshi.
- He told me you never went there

983
02:11:29,428 --> 02:11:34,024
I bumped into Uncle Rustom on the way.
He persuaded me to go home with him

984
02:11:34,433 --> 02:11:39,632
Yesterday? I've never seen her face
ever after you married her

985
02:11:46,111 --> 02:11:50,946
So I took an oath.
If I ever married you...

986
02:11:51,450 --> 02:11:55,250
"for a month after the marriage,
I'd stay a virgin"

987
02:11:58,257 --> 02:12:02,387
You wife is having an affair with
Karan. It began before you married her

988
02:12:44,436 --> 02:12:45,767
Sir... you?

989
02:12:45,838 --> 02:12:49,239
Once you barged into my office
without permission

990
02:12:50,042 --> 02:12:52,033
"Today, I'm here"

991
02:12:53,912 --> 02:12:56,904
I was looking for a magazine
to while away my time...

992
02:12:57,449 --> 02:12:59,917
and I found this file of yours

993
02:13:00,386 --> 02:13:02,377
You researched me thoroughly

994
02:13:16,001 --> 02:13:20,995
"Not someone rich, I want to marry
a girl of character"

995
02:13:30,416 --> 02:13:34,409
You have come to my house for the
first time. What can I do for you?

996
02:13:35,421 --> 02:13:40,154
You got me to marry Priya.
What better can you do?

997
02:13:42,428 --> 02:13:45,022
So I came to do something for you

998
02:13:47,433 --> 02:13:48,957
Nice

999
02:13:49,768 --> 02:13:51,099
Go on

1000
02:13:51,570 --> 02:13:57,440
"In myplace, if your wife was deceiving
you in league with her lover..."

1001
02:13:59,511 --> 02:14:02,878
what would you do?
- I?

1002
02:14:03,982 --> 02:14:08,976
I would've thrown her out.
I would've divorced her

1003
02:14:13,959 --> 02:14:15,950
But I'll do nothing of the sort

1004
02:14:17,696 --> 02:14:24,795
Much sets us apart. You can't even
afford a decent place to live in

1005
02:14:25,404 --> 02:14:28,305
Were it not for the sympathies
of the owner of this house...

1006
02:14:28,407 --> 02:14:31,399
"who let you stay on,
you'd be out on the streets"

1007
02:14:34,413 --> 02:14:38,873
I also live
in your wife's heart

1008
02:14:45,424 --> 02:14:48,416
Nothing can be more shameful
for a husband...

1009
02:14:48,560 --> 02:14:53,088
than a wife who prefers
a lover to her husband

1010
02:14:54,767 --> 02:14:56,166
Lover...

1011
02:14:56,435 --> 02:14:59,962
Iover is one who will
gouge out the eyes...

1012
02:15:00,172 --> 02:15:02,902
that even dare to ogle
at the object of his love

1013
02:15:03,375 --> 02:15:05,843
"You're no lover,
you're a pimp"

1014
02:15:07,646 --> 02:15:12,640
And I'm here to give you your cut.
Not that you deserve even that

1015
02:15:13,051 --> 02:15:18,387
But this concerns Raj Singhania's wife.
So I'm giving you 500 million

1016
02:15:21,860 --> 02:15:24,852
To get out of Priya's life?
- No

1017
02:15:27,065 --> 02:15:29,556
To kill Priya

1018
02:15:35,574 --> 02:15:38,202
"For your sake, she has played
with my emotions"

1019
02:15:38,844 --> 02:15:41,836
She has ridiculed the trust
that my family reposed in her

1020
02:15:43,081 --> 02:15:50,214
"I loved her more than dear life.
Not anymore, now I hate her"

1021
02:15:51,423 --> 02:15:56,087
"Only after you have killed her,
my heart will find peace"

1022
02:16:00,766 --> 02:16:03,564
How could you imagine I'd do this?

1023
02:16:06,371 --> 02:16:09,534
No imaginations. I know
you will do this job

1024
02:16:10,742 --> 02:16:13,233
"If Priya deceived me,
she did it for your sake"

1025
02:16:13,445 --> 02:16:15,970
So you got to do the killing

1026
02:16:18,383 --> 02:16:24,720
"Mr Singhania, this is Harry.
Karan just tried to kill me"

1027
02:16:24,923 --> 02:16:29,383
"They are about to con you
out of your money"

1028
02:16:29,895 --> 02:16:32,989
"Karan killed Jojo Fernandes
right in front of my eyes"

1029
02:16:33,398 --> 02:16:37,198
"By the time you get this message
I might be dead"

1030
02:16:40,506 --> 02:16:42,940
You have only two options

1031
02:16:43,442 --> 02:16:50,871
One takes you to the gallows.
The other makes you a millionaire

1032
02:16:51,917 --> 02:16:56,911
"If you want to become a millionaire,
come over to my house at five sharp"

1033
02:16:57,289 --> 02:16:59,655
I will give you an advance.
100 million

1034
02:16:59,758 --> 02:17:04,422
And I'll tell you when and how
to commit the murder

1035
02:17:27,452 --> 02:17:31,445
"Rather late, aren't you?
- There was an urgent meeting"

1036
02:17:32,057 --> 02:17:35,458
"You look disturbed.
- Yes, there was this deal"

1037
02:17:35,561 --> 02:17:39,463
I wagered my life and it's failed.
- How?

1038
02:17:40,465 --> 02:17:43,332
Someone very close to me
has deceived me...

1039
02:17:43,535 --> 02:17:47,869
someone I'd trust
as much as I trust you

1040
02:17:50,475 --> 02:17:55,811
But deceit can't last forever.
Now I know who it is

1041
02:17:58,216 --> 02:18:02,414
"Only a matter of a few days now,
I'll set everything right"

1042
02:18:03,855 --> 02:18:08,417
"Oh yes, Uncle Rustom's anniversary.
The party is tomorrow"

1043
02:18:09,428 --> 02:18:12,022
Make sure you go.
- Won't you come?

1044
02:18:12,364 --> 02:18:16,824
No. I got one last meeting to attend
to square off this deal

1045
02:18:18,437 --> 02:18:22,032
"But you must go. Else,
Uncle Rustom will mind"

1046
02:18:37,456 --> 02:18:41,017
"In that dress, you look lovely!
- How are you, Kajal?"

1047
02:18:41,126 --> 02:18:44,254
What have you been doing?
- After the troupe broke up...

1048
02:18:44,463 --> 02:18:47,330
I took up a job in Calcutta.
I'm here just for this party

1049
02:18:47,466 --> 02:18:51,459
I wanted to meet all of you.
Are you in touch with the others?

1050
02:18:51,770 --> 02:18:55,467
"And what's Karan upto? Poor thing,
he must be upset about the break-up"

1051
02:19:09,521 --> 02:19:12,752
A hundred million is lots of money.
That's why...

1052
02:19:17,496 --> 02:19:21,990
What are you ogling at?
Mansions like these are built upon...

1053
02:19:22,100 --> 02:19:25,092
"the business of hard work,
not pimping"

1054
02:19:25,837 --> 02:19:30,433
Wonderful! I'm getting to learn

1055
02:19:32,144 --> 02:19:37,104
It was great having you here.
- And Raj never came?

1056
02:19:37,449 --> 02:19:41,180
"He would've come,
but he has an important meeting"

1057
02:19:44,623 --> 02:19:46,955
You will kill Priya tomorrow

1058
02:19:51,463 --> 02:19:55,729
Tomorrow is Friday. Only Priya
and Mrs Braganza will be at home

1059
02:19:56,768 --> 02:19:59,703
At 4:30 sharp Mrs Braganza leaves
for the church

1060
02:20:00,839 --> 02:20:03,831
She uses a remote control device
to open the gates

1061
02:20:04,409 --> 02:20:09,403
"The gate takes 30 seconds to shut.
By then, you should get in"

1062
02:20:10,482 --> 02:20:15,010
"And remember, the boundaries
are secured by alarms"

1063
02:20:16,421 --> 02:20:20,414
"Priya, what's wrong with your mood?
- Nothing, really"

1064
02:20:21,493 --> 02:20:25,429
"You must be hiding something from me.
Look, I'm your best friend"

1065
02:20:25,764 --> 02:20:30,428
"Share your woes with friends,
unburden yourself. What happened?"

1066
02:20:30,769 --> 02:20:32,760
A tiff with Raj?

1067
02:20:33,438 --> 02:20:37,101
I'll leave this window open
for you to enter

1068
02:20:40,912 --> 02:20:44,439
"You enter the hall,
then you hide behind that curtain"

1069
02:20:45,517 --> 02:20:48,452
"At 4:45 sharp, I'll place a call
on that telephone"

1070
02:20:49,921 --> 02:20:54,255
Priya will come to receive the phone.
As she takes the call...

1071
02:21:00,565 --> 02:21:07,562
the phone mustn't be disconnected.
I want to hear her every dying scream

1072
02:21:10,108 --> 02:21:15,045
Such devious planning? I'm glad
you broke ties with Karan

1073
02:21:16,414 --> 02:21:21,818
But I'm still hiding it from Raj.
I think I'm still deceiving him

1074
02:21:22,420 --> 02:21:25,412
"To hide one lie, I've been lying
again and again"

1075
02:21:26,424 --> 02:21:31,157
I don't know what to do.
- Between husband and wife...

1076
02:21:31,329 --> 02:21:35,163
there must be no secrets.
How long will you go on lying?

1077
02:21:35,534 --> 02:21:41,769
You must tell him before he comes to
know. I'm sure he will forgive you

1078
02:21:50,448 --> 02:21:57,718
"Raj, here's something I must tell you
even if I might lose you forever"

1079
02:21:59,391 --> 02:22:04,192
Because no husband who has heard this
will forgive his wife

1080
02:22:07,399 --> 02:22:12,132
"Raj, I have deceived you.
Before we were married..."

1081
02:22:12,404 --> 02:22:16,204
"I didn't love you,
I was in love with Karan"

1082
02:22:18,276 --> 02:22:20,710
His every word I trusted

1083
02:22:22,080 --> 02:22:27,211
Then Karan showed me a dream;
to make his dream come true...

1084
02:22:27,419 --> 02:22:31,219
"I married you, with the intention
of divorcing you..."

1085
02:22:31,356 --> 02:22:34,154
so that Karan and I could grab
your money

1086
02:22:34,626 --> 02:22:37,823
But now I have broken
all ties with Karan

1087
02:22:38,597 --> 02:22:44,126
"In my heart, in my every breath,
yours is the only name that lingers"

1088
02:22:45,971 --> 02:22:50,772
"I do not deserve your sympathies.
Yet, after you have heard it all..."

1089
02:22:50,909 --> 02:22:57,007
"if you think you can forgive me,
just give me a call"

1090
02:22:59,384 --> 02:23:05,118
"Tonight, come home to your bride,
not to Priya"

1091
02:23:07,058 --> 02:23:09,390
If you cannot forgive me...

1092
02:23:11,396 --> 02:23:14,388
I will depart from this world
in peace knowing...

1093
02:23:15,734 --> 02:23:22,731
"if only for a day, I have been yours,
in heart and soul"

1094
02:23:55,941 --> 02:23:57,932
Put it down

1095
02:24:04,382 --> 02:24:11,185
You know what day it's today?
- I know. The month is over

1096
02:24:11,957 --> 02:24:14,755
"Tonight, I'm giving you
a big surprise"

1097
02:24:18,396 --> 02:24:23,060
"What more pleasant a surprise for me,
than having you to myself?"

1098
02:24:27,405 --> 02:24:29,999
How could I not be yours?

1099
02:24:31,710 --> 02:24:34,873
Wasn't it for my sake
that you took such a vow?

1100
02:24:38,883 --> 02:24:40,874
The month is finished

1101
02:24:41,653 --> 02:24:45,214
But every moment till tonight
is going to haunt me

1102
02:24:53,131 --> 02:24:57,966
Thank God you aren't hurt.
- Breaking glass is a good omen

1103
02:24:58,870 --> 02:25:02,362
I imagine I'm going to be given
my heart's wish

1104
02:25:05,043 --> 02:25:08,376
May God give you your every wish

1105
02:25:13,385 --> 02:25:16,047
Why are you looking at me like that?

1106
02:25:19,391 --> 02:25:24,795
That innocence writ on your face
that drove me crazy... is still there

1107
02:25:51,222 --> 02:25:52,814
Saxena... you?

1108
02:25:52,991 --> 02:25:57,428
Aren't you supposed to report on the
textile mills at today's board meeting?

1109
02:25:57,695 --> 02:26:00,220
I came over to discuss
a few details

1110
02:26:32,297 --> 02:26:38,395
Singhania Cements. The 2-year old
baby in the Singhania group

1111
02:26:38,970 --> 02:26:43,964
Singhania Cements has achieved
a turnover exceeding 15 billion...

1112
02:26:44,409 --> 02:26:46,673
a 150 percent growth
over last year

1113
02:27:09,834 --> 02:27:11,825
Our share value has doubled

1114
02:27:27,485 --> 02:27:31,444
Dressed like a bride? You look exotic.
Something special today?

1115
02:27:32,457 --> 02:27:36,120
"Yes, it's the most important day
in my life"

1116
02:27:37,362 --> 02:27:43,790
"At the church, I'll pray,
may God save you from the evil eye"

1117
02:28:21,439 --> 02:28:26,433
The textiles unit has just bagged
a 5-year contract for army uniforms

1118
02:28:49,534 --> 02:28:52,697
I think the meeting has produced
desired results

1119
02:28:53,137 --> 02:28:58,939
"No Saxena, I've only mooted the plan.
It remains to be executed"

1120
02:29:43,454 --> 02:29:45,251
Raj...

1121
02:31:23,888 --> 02:31:30,760
"Raj, here's something I must tell you
even if I might lose you forever"

1122
02:31:32,563 --> 02:31:37,432
Because no husband who has heard this
will forgive his wife

1123
02:31:39,437 --> 02:31:42,838
Why are you killing me?
Who are you?

1124
02:31:48,780 --> 02:31:55,777
Then Karan showed me a dream; to make
his dream come true I married you

1125
02:31:59,390 --> 02:32:02,052
Don't kill me

1126
02:32:05,396 --> 02:32:08,194
Don't... oh what have I done?

1127
02:32:15,973 --> 02:32:21,172
"I do not deserve your sympathies.
Yet, after you have heard it all..."

1128
02:32:21,312 --> 02:32:26,011
"if you think you can forgive me,
just give me a call"

1129
02:32:27,418 --> 02:32:32,412
"Tonight, come home to your bride,
not to Priya"

1130
02:32:55,446 --> 02:33:01,646
"If you cannot forgive me, I will depart
from this world in peace knowing..."

1131
02:33:02,653 --> 02:33:09,650
"if only for a day, I have been yours,
in heart and soul"

1132
02:34:57,902 --> 02:35:01,394
Why didn't you tell me before?

1133
02:35:17,488 --> 02:35:21,754
Your wife has survived
a murderous assault

1134
02:35:21,959 --> 02:35:24,257
The assassin has been killed

1135
02:35:24,929 --> 02:35:27,261
Will you please come with me

1136
02:35:30,434 --> 02:35:36,270
The break-in shows that he knew
his way around your house

1137
02:35:36,941 --> 02:35:40,934
Take a look at the corpse.
You might know him

1138
02:35:41,846 --> 02:35:43,780
Remove the shroud

1139
02:35:54,792 --> 02:35:57,784
Do you know him?
- No

1140
02:35:59,864 --> 02:36:01,729
Come Mr Karan

1141
02:36:14,345 --> 02:36:16,540
He is the one
who saved your wife

1142
02:36:16,814 --> 02:36:19,715
Had he not arrived in the nick of time
and killed the assassin...

1143
02:36:19,817 --> 02:36:25,551
the unthinkable might've happened.
- It's the Lord above who sent me here

1144
02:36:32,763 --> 02:36:34,754
Do you remember telling me...

1145
02:36:34,899 --> 02:36:38,562
"that mansions like these are built
on businesses, not out of pimping?"

1146
02:36:39,437 --> 02:36:42,998
"So I thought,
how about some business?"

1147
02:36:45,776 --> 02:36:48,768
You wanted me to kill Priya
in order to frame me

1148
02:36:49,847 --> 02:36:53,305
I sent in a substitute.
Now I've got you framed...

1149
02:36:53,784 --> 02:36:58,585
for some more profit
out of business

1150
02:37:01,125 --> 02:37:07,792
"You seem agitated.
Relax, we'll talk later"

1151
02:37:14,939 --> 02:37:19,808
We've found out about the attacker.
He was a small-time thief

1152
02:37:20,344 --> 02:37:24,280
"A sum of 500,000 was recovered
from his residence"

1153
02:37:24,815 --> 02:37:28,751
We are investigating
where he got so much money from

1154
02:37:29,253 --> 02:37:32,745
I'll keep you informed
about developments

1155
02:37:41,766 --> 02:37:44,098
Yes... grandma?
- Such a grave incident...

1156
02:37:44,201 --> 02:37:49,503
and you don't even give us a call?
- I didn't want you to get anxious

1157
02:37:49,807 --> 02:37:52,332
You will return to Jaipur forthwith
and bring Priya along

1158
02:37:52,777 --> 02:37:57,339
Thank God Karan turned up in the
nick of time and he saved Priya

1159
02:37:59,784 --> 02:38:04,448
"Karan?
- Yes, he's in Jaipur on business"

1160
02:38:04,855 --> 02:38:07,449
He's right here. One minute

1161
02:38:07,792 --> 02:38:09,123
Karan...
- Yes?

1162
02:38:09,226 --> 02:38:10,955
Come here

1163
02:38:13,964 --> 02:38:15,591
Talk to Raj

1164
02:38:17,968 --> 02:38:20,198
"My friend, how are you?
- How is Priya?"

1165
02:38:20,538 --> 02:38:22,529
What are you doing there?

1166
02:38:22,740 --> 02:38:25,732
I'm here on business...
it's the deal I told you about

1167
02:38:27,745 --> 02:38:30,407
Why don't you come over to Jaipur?

1168
02:38:31,248 --> 02:38:33,239
I'm coming

1169
02:38:33,417 --> 02:38:34,907
He's coming

1170
02:38:48,098 --> 02:38:49,497
Priya and Raj

1171
02:39:02,780 --> 02:39:05,442
How is it going?
Good to have you here

1172
02:39:05,816 --> 02:39:09,377
"Take Priya inside...
cast away the evil eye. Go on, dear"

1173
02:39:14,792 --> 02:39:19,058
Has the police found out the identity
of the man who attacked Priya?

1174
02:39:20,731 --> 02:39:23,723
"They say, he was a thief.
- I can't accept that"

1175
02:39:24,168 --> 02:39:27,160
It seemed to me as if
he was bent upon killing her

1176
02:39:28,072 --> 02:39:30,063
"Luckily, I landed there
in the nick of time"

1177
02:39:30,241 --> 02:39:34,735
"Son, we are indebted to you.
- No obligations"

1178
02:39:35,179 --> 02:39:38,410
Once we have agreed upon the terms
and conditions of our business...

1179
02:39:38,649 --> 02:39:41,743
"consider the debt paid. Else,
I can always fall back upon you, no?"

1180
02:39:43,287 --> 02:39:45,755
Get fresh Raj. I'll see you
in my room

1181
02:39:58,435 --> 02:40:00,232
Welcome

1182
02:40:00,771 --> 02:40:02,671
How dare you come here?

1183
02:40:08,779 --> 02:40:12,772
If Harry's cassette
gives you this attitude...

1184
02:40:14,785 --> 02:40:17,777
"remember, you can't prove that
I killed Harry using that cassette"

1185
02:40:18,789 --> 02:40:22,452
Murder may be assumed
only after the recovery of a corpse

1186
02:40:23,060 --> 02:40:26,518
But the corpse... has vanished

1187
02:40:27,231 --> 02:40:30,064
"As for Jojo's murder, even the police
think it was an accident"

1188
02:40:34,271 --> 02:40:39,538
Raj Singhania... my plan for
framing you was perfect

1189
02:40:40,077 --> 02:40:42,068
Only Priya deceived me

1190
02:40:42,813 --> 02:40:49,548
You can forgive her? That's very well.
But I can't forgive her

1191
02:40:51,455 --> 02:40:54,447
So when you came offering me
the contract to kill Priya...

1192
02:40:54,792 --> 02:40:58,057
I found another way
to make my plan succeed

1193
02:41:00,864 --> 02:41:05,358
"You played an audio cassette,
didn't you? Let me show you a video"

1194
02:41:08,872 --> 02:41:10,863
You will kill Priya tomorrow

1195
02:41:13,777 --> 02:41:18,111
Tomorrow is Friday. Only Priya
and Mrs Braganza will be at home

1196
02:41:20,884 --> 02:41:25,412
I'll leave this window open
for you to enter

1197
02:41:26,790 --> 02:41:32,422
"At 4:45 sharp, I'll dial that number.
Priya will come to receive the phone"

1198
02:41:33,764 --> 02:41:40,101
The phone mustn't be disconnected.
I want to hear her every dying scream

1199
02:41:43,240 --> 02:41:49,338
How do you like my video episode?
I culled that idea from TV

1200
02:41:51,015 --> 02:41:56,749
"In fact, it's going to be
a great hit on TV"

1201
02:41:59,757 --> 02:42:01,418
Now what?

1202
02:42:03,761 --> 02:42:07,424
"Conspiracy for murder...
at least 7-8 years, guaranteed"

1203
02:42:08,132 --> 02:42:12,501
But that's only what happens to you.
Think! What happens to your family?

1204
02:42:14,438 --> 02:42:17,271
Who will ever marry
your sisters? Not I

1205
02:42:19,476 --> 02:42:26,473
What about those kids? Won't they
ask you why you're handcuffed?

1206
02:42:28,385 --> 02:42:34,119
Finding answers could be tough.
And grandma... poor grandma

1207
02:42:35,793 --> 02:42:38,785
The shame of it will drive her
to suicide

1208
02:42:40,798 --> 02:42:44,791
You gave me two options.
I'll give you three

1209
02:42:45,836 --> 02:42:51,138
"One, divorce Priya. Alimony, 1 billion"

1210
02:42:51,608 --> 02:42:54,372
"Two, jail. Three, kill yourself"

1211
02:42:56,080 --> 02:43:00,813
"If you like option One, a divorce deed
will be ready for you tomorrow"

1212
02:43:01,819 --> 02:43:04,549
Come over to Jaigarh fort
for the signing formalities

1213
02:43:06,590 --> 02:43:10,583
"Yes, make sure you bring
the balance 40 million you owe me"

1214
02:43:11,361 --> 02:43:15,559
It's only for the expenses
until the divorce goes through

1215
02:43:52,302 --> 02:43:53,860
Welcome... welcome

1216
02:44:05,816 --> 02:44:08,979
What do I look like?
Some businessman... like you?

1217
02:44:13,190 --> 02:44:16,182
Haven't you brought the money?

1218
02:44:21,765 --> 02:44:24,757
"Anyway, I can recover from you
anytime"

1219
02:44:25,169 --> 02:44:27,330
"The divorce papers, please"

1220
02:44:32,876 --> 02:44:35,208
My security

1221
02:44:35,345 --> 02:44:39,782
"Nowadays for a businessman,
danger is lurking everywhere"

1222
02:44:40,117 --> 02:44:43,450
"Telephone calls, threats,
who knows who might do what?"

1223
02:44:45,789 --> 02:44:49,384
"Here, sign. I must get it
registered in court today"

1224
02:45:01,805 --> 02:45:04,797
I have decided.
I'm going to jail

1225
02:45:08,812 --> 02:45:14,216
But not for 7 years. For 14 years
I'm going to kill you

1226
02:45:16,553 --> 02:45:21,217
Good you brought them along.
They can carry your corpse

1227
02:47:27,017 --> 02:47:30,748
I didn't want
any more of these killings

1228
02:47:31,855 --> 02:47:36,485
But a moron like you
won't let me live like a gentleman

1229
02:47:37,761 --> 02:47:39,752
Now you die

1230
02:47:40,497 --> 02:47:43,762
Priya still thinks I am a gentleman.
Today or tomorrow...

1231
02:47:43,934 --> 02:47:46,767
she will come to me
and she will bring your wealth along

1232
02:48:00,250 --> 02:48:03,413
"Wonderful to have you here, Priya!
You don't know..."

1233
02:48:03,553 --> 02:48:07,114
what a rogue your husband is!
The man who attacked you...

1234
02:48:07,224 --> 02:48:09,658
was no burglar. He's the man
who sent him

1235
02:48:11,061 --> 02:48:14,656
He wants to kill you!
I swear... I swear

1236
02:48:16,299 --> 02:48:18,290
And I have the proof

1237
02:48:24,474 --> 02:48:29,138
I saw the evidence for myself
when you were blackmailing Raj

1238
02:48:29,546 --> 02:48:34,074
I also know how many men
you killed for your motives

1239
02:48:34,484 --> 02:48:39,319
"And I thought you're a good friend,
a sympathiser. But now I know..."

1240
02:48:39,423 --> 02:48:44,622
"how greedy, how selfish you are.
No, I'm not coming to you"

1241
02:48:44,928 --> 02:48:50,764
I regret that I ever had anything
to do with a scoundrel like you
