1
00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:52,756
This is the last of the trucks,
lieutenant. We'll embark in four hours.

2
00:01:52,928 --> 00:01:57,729
Give the men, oh, another hour at
the party and then get them up fast.

3
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,835
Do you think they're having too much fun
to sail for the States?

4
00:02:01,003 --> 00:02:02,027
I think you're right.

5
00:02:02,204 --> 00:02:03,535
- Good luck to you.
- Thank you.

6
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,640
- Okay, driver.
- Yes, sir.

7
00:02:33,035 --> 00:02:35,595
Okay, Miller, out you go.
This infirmary's closed.

8
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:38,103
And you're going home
along with the rest of us.

9
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:41,071
Yeah, that's right.
They finally found a ship for you.

10
00:02:41,243 --> 00:02:43,473
<i>It ain't the Queen Mary, but it floats.</i>

11
00:02:43,646 --> 00:02:45,614
Why don't you go
to the party downstairs...

12
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:47,544
...and have some fun
until it's time to leave?

13
00:02:47,716 --> 00:02:49,183
Uh...

14
00:02:49,418 --> 00:02:51,978
Listen, sonny boy,
if you're too shy to go to a party...

15
00:02:52,154 --> 00:02:53,178
...okay, don't go.

16
00:02:53,355 --> 00:02:55,255
But don't kid me
about this silly bandage.

17
00:02:55,424 --> 00:02:58,086
You've been over the mumps
for two days now and we both know it.

18
00:02:59,695 --> 00:03:02,823
What's wrong with you anyway?
You don't talk, you don't make friends.

19
00:03:02,998 --> 00:03:05,398
You don't whistle at me
or any of the nurses.

20
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:07,660
You know,
nobody even knows your first name.

21
00:03:07,836 --> 00:03:09,167
Uh, Danny.

22
00:03:09,338 --> 00:03:11,272
Danny.

23
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,340
If you was in love, I could understand it.

24
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:16,307
But you don't even have
a pinup girl in sight.

25
00:03:16,712 --> 00:03:18,179
Hey, it is love.

26
00:03:18,347 --> 00:03:21,373
Well, what's the matter?
Can't I even take a look at your girl?

27
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,911
- That's the Brooklyn Bridge.
- Sure.

28
00:03:24,086 --> 00:03:26,111
That's my pinup girl. Isn't she a beauty?

29
00:03:26,288 --> 00:03:28,552
- But you're not from Brooklyn.
- You wanna bet?

30
00:03:28,724 --> 00:03:30,817
Listen, I'm from Brooklyn,
so don't tell me.

31
00:03:30,993 --> 00:03:33,757
I know what Brooklyn guys are like
and they're not like you.

32
00:03:33,929 --> 00:03:36,489
Well, I can't help that,
but that's where I'm from.

33
00:03:36,665 --> 00:03:40,101
Go ahead, ask me some questions about it.
Go ahead, ask me, why don't you?

34
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:41,827
Where is the Loew's Met?

35
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:43,835
Nevins Street.

36
00:03:44,006 --> 00:03:45,268
Prospect Park?

37
00:03:45,674 --> 00:03:46,834
Eastern Parkway.

38
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,038
Ebbets Field?

39
00:03:49,211 --> 00:03:50,644
Bedford and Sullivan.

40
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,280
So there.

41
00:03:54,216 --> 00:03:56,241
You could've read it in a book.

42
00:03:56,418 --> 00:03:59,478
But if it is true, then you really
ought to be ashamed of yourself.

43
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:01,122
Hiding like a rabbit in a hole.

44
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,622
Why aren't you at that party
like a Brooklyn guy...

45
00:04:03,792 --> 00:04:07,751
...making friends for yourself and for
Brooklyn? A Brooklyn guy is a friendly guy.

46
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,330
Well, I will be once I get home.

47
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:12,899
It's easier in Brooklyn.

48
00:04:13,936 --> 00:04:17,633
I don't care how many photographs you got,
don't care how many streets you know.

49
00:04:17,806 --> 00:04:22,004
When I see you out making a friend,
then I believe you're from Brooklyn.

50
00:05:00,616 --> 00:05:04,450
Hey, now, fellas,
now come on, cut it out.

51
00:05:48,864 --> 00:05:51,492
- How you doing, pal?
- Shh.

52
00:05:53,902 --> 00:05:55,631
Brooklyn.

53
00:05:59,374 --> 00:06:00,932
Shh!

54
00:06:37,145 --> 00:06:38,169
Good, huh?

55
00:06:38,347 --> 00:06:40,372
Flat. Flat as yesterday's beer.

56
00:06:40,549 --> 00:06:44,178
Hey, hey, bud, do you know
"Whose Baby Are You?"

57
00:06:44,353 --> 00:06:47,845
"Whose Baby Are...?" No, no, I'm
frightfully sorry, I don't, but...

58
00:06:48,023 --> 00:06:50,218
Never mind. Forget it.

59
00:06:50,392 --> 00:06:53,452
Say, say, I know that song.
You mind if I give you a small rundown?

60
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:56,154
No, not at all. Sit down.

61
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,735
<i>Baby, baby</i>

62
00:07:05,908 --> 00:07:08,672
<i>Whose baby are you?</i>

63
00:07:08,844 --> 00:07:11,608
<i>Baby, baby</i>

64
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,271
<i>Whose baby are you?</i>

65
00:07:14,549 --> 00:07:17,712
<i>Well, that sounds more like
Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony.</i>

66
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:34,599
Sure, the notes are the same,
but it hasn't got a beat.

67
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,170
- A beat?
- Yeah, you know, a beat.

68
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:40,536
Oh, no, I'm afraid I haven't got that.
Look, why don't you take over?

69
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:43,507
- Wait, I don't wanna crab your act.
- Oh, I'm rather relieved.

70
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:46,477
I was supposed to be entertaining,
but I'm hardly succeeding.

71
00:07:46,648 --> 00:07:48,047
Good night.

72
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:51,613
Hey, fatso, go on, hit it.

73
00:07:56,758 --> 00:07:58,783
- Hey, fellas, chow.
Chow!

74
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:02,859
Let's get that, boys.

75
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,711
Brooklyn.

76
00:08:26,021 --> 00:08:28,854
Do I understand
that you're from Brooklyn?

77
00:08:29,024 --> 00:08:30,924
Why, yes,
as hard as it may be to believe.

78
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,288
No, no, quite the contrary.
You're so friendly.

79
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:36,295
It's only in Brooklyn
that people are as friendly as that.

80
00:08:36,465 --> 00:08:40,265
Just a second, with that accent you're not
gonna tell me you're from Brooklyn.

81
00:08:40,435 --> 00:08:42,767
No such luck. No, that was Mama.

82
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:44,633
She was born there.

83
00:08:44,806 --> 00:08:47,798
Well, how do you like that?
My name's Danny Miller.

84
00:08:47,976 --> 00:08:50,274
She came to England
when she was quite a child...

85
00:08:50,445 --> 00:08:52,538
...but she talked about Brooklyn
all her life.

86
00:08:52,714 --> 00:08:54,978
That's how I guessed
that you were from Brooklyn.

87
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,017
The moment that you
tried to help that young man in there.

88
00:08:58,186 --> 00:09:00,120
The square? The guy that was playing?

89
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:03,951
- I didn't do very much.
- But you had such poise.

90
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,150
I did?

91
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:07,318
Such confidence, such self-assurance.

92
00:09:07,896 --> 00:09:11,627
- I did?
- It was wonderful.

93
00:09:12,234 --> 00:09:15,897
Well, I guess that's the way it is
with all us guys from Brooklyn.

94
00:09:16,071 --> 00:09:18,869
I know.
That's why I'm going to ask a favor.

95
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:22,875
That young man is my grandson,
Jamie Shellgrove.

96
00:09:23,478 --> 00:09:26,003
- Oh, gee, I didn't mean to say any...
- No, no.

97
00:09:26,181 --> 00:09:28,274
He is a square.

98
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,351
He's shy, can't talk to people,
doesn't have fun.

99
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,953
And the music he writes...

100
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:35,180
That stuff he was playing,
that sounded good.

101
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:36,654
It isn't young.

102
00:09:36,825 --> 00:09:39,487
Everything he writes
sounds just like a funeral march.

103
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:42,459
That's why I thought
that if you were to talk to him...

104
00:09:42,631 --> 00:09:44,496
Me? Oh, now wait a minute, Dad...

105
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:49,069
A little advice from someone like you,
sure of himself.

106
00:09:50,338 --> 00:09:53,330
Forceful and...
Why, I know that you could help him.

107
00:09:53,508 --> 00:09:56,705
Honest, Dad,
I think you've got the wrong guy. I...

108
00:09:59,247 --> 00:10:01,511
Sure, I'd be very happy
to give him a few pointers

109
00:10:01,683 --> 00:10:04,117
- Any time you say.
- Thank you, Danny.

110
00:10:04,286 --> 00:10:06,447
We live just across the garden.

111
00:10:06,621 --> 00:10:09,419
- Are you the caretaker here?
- Well, sort of.

112
00:10:09,591 --> 00:10:13,687
Oh, I wish that Jamie
were a little bit more like you.

113
00:10:14,229 --> 00:10:17,494
You should see him trying to
talk to a girl. It's gruesome.

114
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,497
That's what it is, gruesome.

115
00:10:19,668 --> 00:10:22,535
And here's Danny,
going back to Brooklyn.

116
00:10:22,704 --> 00:10:27,164
Been away four years
and yet he knows that in two weeks...

117
00:10:27,342 --> 00:10:30,004
...he'll find exactly
the sort of girl he wants.

118
00:10:30,178 --> 00:10:31,202
Won't you, Danny?

119
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:33,711
Well, that's right, Pop.
But that's in Brooklyn.

120
00:10:33,882 --> 00:10:35,713
And in Brooklyn, you know, it's easier.

121
00:10:35,884 --> 00:10:37,784
Well, it wouldn't be easier for me.

122
00:10:37,953 --> 00:10:40,979
It is difficult for me to talk to people.
That's unfortunate.

123
00:10:41,156 --> 00:10:44,853
And as if you and Grandfather seem to think
there's something missing in my music...

124
00:10:45,026 --> 00:10:46,891
...it's because it's missing in me.

125
00:10:47,062 --> 00:10:51,055
And I'm afraid that I'd be exactly
the same in Brooklyn or anywhere.

126
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,361
Look, Jamie, about anywhere I don't know,
but in Brooklyn...

127
00:10:54,536 --> 00:10:56,936
...in one week's time,
you'll be talking to a girl.

128
00:10:57,105 --> 00:10:59,266
A girl? Ten girls.

129
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:01,204
You'll have your pick of 10 girls.

130
00:11:01,376 --> 00:11:02,434
- Ten?
- Mm-hm.

131
00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:04,875
- Stimulating town, what?
- Rather.

132
00:11:05,046 --> 00:11:08,379
And that's not all. In two weeks,
you'll be writing a new kind of music.

133
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,744
Music that sings.

134
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:13,479
In three weeks' time you'll be taking it
to a publisher and having it played.

135
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:14,713
But that's in Brooklyn.

136
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,790
Of course.
That's what you need, Brooklyn.

137
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,926
You send him over to me. I'll fix him up.

138
00:11:19,094 --> 00:11:21,085
You won't know him
when I get through with him.

139
00:11:22,597 --> 00:11:24,997
Gee, I gotta go.

140
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:26,498
- Bye, Danny.
- It's too bad.

141
00:11:26,668 --> 00:11:28,795
I got some good ideas.
But that was the signal.

142
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,598
- You've been awfully kind.
- And thanks, thanks very much.

143
00:11:31,773 --> 00:11:34,435
Don't forget, if you have any trouble
send him over to me.

144
00:11:34,609 --> 00:11:36,941
I'll take care of him, fix him,
straighten him out.

145
00:11:37,112 --> 00:11:39,307
I'll make him the greatest so...

146
00:11:45,253 --> 00:11:47,983
"Duke of Dunstable. "

147
00:12:05,707 --> 00:12:07,436
- Hey, buddy, where you going?
- Newark.

148
00:12:07,609 --> 00:12:12,205
- You can catch a train there for anyplace.
- Oh, that's too slow, much too slow.

149
00:12:17,652 --> 00:12:20,212
Can this cab take me to the bridge,
the Brooklyn Bridge?

150
00:12:20,388 --> 00:12:24,154
Mister, this cab will take you anyplace
you wanna go. Come on, get in.

151
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,624
Hold it, hold it, stop.
This is it, here it is.

152
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:55,284
<i>Isn't she a beauty?</i>

153
00:12:55,457 --> 00:12:58,017
<i>Isn't she a queen?</i>

154
00:12:58,193 --> 00:13:04,223
<i>Nicest bridge that I have ever seen</i>

155
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,427
<i>Her paint's a little tattered</i>

156
00:13:09,004 --> 00:13:12,167
<i>Where age has left its touch</i>

157
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:18,802
<i>Still I guess I'll always love her</i>

158
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,040
<i>very much</i>

159
00:13:27,255 --> 00:13:30,122
<i>Like the folks you meet on</i>

160
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:36,253
<i>Like to plant my feet on
The Brooklyn Bridge</i>

161
00:13:40,168 --> 00:13:43,535
<i>What a lovely view from</i>

162
00:13:43,705 --> 00:13:49,007
<i>Heaven looks at you from
The Brooklyn Bridge</i>

163
00:13:52,447 --> 00:13:58,875
<i>I love to listen to the
wind Through her strings</i>

164
00:13:59,054 --> 00:14:03,821
<i>The song that it sings for the town</i>

165
00:14:05,593 --> 00:14:10,929
<i>I love to look up
At the clouds in her hair</i>

166
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:16,067
<i>She's learned to wear like a crown</i>

167
00:14:18,473 --> 00:14:21,135
<i>If you've been a rover</i>

168
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:27,043
<i>Journey's end lies over
The Brooklyn Bridge</i>

169
00:14:30,852 --> 00:14:33,878
<i>Don't let no one tell you</i>

170
00:14:34,055 --> 00:14:40,324
<i>That I've been trying to
sell you The Brooklyn Bridge</i>

171
00:14:41,963 --> 00:14:47,595
<i>All the folks in Manhattan are sad</i>

172
00:14:49,704 --> 00:14:55,006
<i>'Cause they look at her
And wish they had</i>

173
00:14:56,211 --> 00:15:02,707
<i>The good old Brooklyn Bridge</i>

174
00:15:13,395 --> 00:15:15,590
Heavens to Betsy.

175
00:15:15,764 --> 00:15:18,824
What's the matter with you, silly?
Wanna get yourself killed?

176
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,299
Is that what Eisenhower taught you?
You slaphappy or something?

177
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,062
No, I'm just happy, that's all.

178
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:26,639
Happy? Sonny, you're in Brooklyn.

179
00:15:26,808 --> 00:15:29,140
Yeah, isn't it wonderful?

180
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:33,838
Soldier, you've been away a long,
long time. You just get in?

181
00:15:34,015 --> 00:15:36,347
Yeah. Just got out too.

182
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,783
You're glad to be in Brooklyn
when you could be over there in New York?

183
00:15:39,954 --> 00:15:43,253
New York?
That's a place to look at Brooklyn from.

184
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:45,154
Say, I've gotta find an armory.

185
00:15:45,326 --> 00:15:47,294
There's one over on Grand Street.

186
00:15:47,462 --> 00:15:50,226
Take the bus on the next corner
and get off at Jay Street...

187
00:15:50,398 --> 00:15:52,730
...being sure to ask the conductor
for a transfer.

188
00:15:52,901 --> 00:15:55,301
- Then you take the Jay Street trolley...
- No, no, no.

189
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:58,303
I want the 14th Regiment Armory.

190
00:15:58,473 --> 00:16:01,169
Oh, well, in that case,
I gotta blow me whistle.

191
00:16:06,314 --> 00:16:08,043
Officer, I wasn't doing more than 30.

192
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:11,674
Young lady, two blocks back, did you
or did you not go through a red light?

193
00:16:11,853 --> 00:16:14,845
Everybody goes through it.
Shouldn't be a stoplight there at all.

194
00:16:15,023 --> 00:16:17,116
Nevertheless,
do I give you a ticket for it...

195
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:21,285
...or do you give this here soldier a lift
to the 14th Regiment Armory?

196
00:16:21,463 --> 00:16:23,556
- Good luck, sonny.
- Gee, thanks very much.

197
00:16:23,731 --> 00:16:26,495
- I'll see you around, huh?
- Won't be here.

198
00:16:26,668 --> 00:16:28,898
It's my last day.

199
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,429
Tomorrow, the New York side
where I belong.

200
00:16:32,874 --> 00:16:35,672
Brooklyn's where they send
the bad policemen.

201
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,674
Nice day, isn't it?

202
00:16:39,848 --> 00:16:42,612
There aren't any nice days in Brooklyn.

203
00:16:43,284 --> 00:16:44,717
Don't you like it here?

204
00:16:44,886 --> 00:16:45,978
Does anyone?

205
00:16:46,154 --> 00:16:47,621
Sure. I do.

206
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:50,690
I've been homesick for this place
for four years now.

207
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:54,522
People get homesick
for some pretty terrible places.

208
00:16:55,396 --> 00:16:56,886
Did you just get back?

209
00:16:57,065 --> 00:16:58,589
Back and out.

210
00:16:58,766 --> 00:17:02,759
All I gotta do is reregister for the draft
and I'll be a civilian again.

211
00:17:02,937 --> 00:17:05,906
Oh. That's why you're going
to the armory?

212
00:17:06,407 --> 00:17:08,739
I didn't know
you had to reregister so soon.

213
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,879
Within 10 days. I wanna get it over with.

214
00:17:12,046 --> 00:17:15,174
I'll be going back to work pretty soon
and I may not have time.

215
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,410
You know, life here in Brooklyn's
pretty fast, and I imagine...

216
00:17:18,586 --> 00:17:23,546
...that I'll be swept up
in the social whirl, hey.

217
00:17:30,198 --> 00:17:31,756
Well, here you are.

218
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:35,596
Look, I can't tell you what it means to me
to meet a small, dark-haired girl...

219
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:39,228
...with a turned-up nose
on my first day back in Brooklyn.

220
00:17:39,407 --> 00:17:40,999
It's kind of like a good omen.

221
00:17:41,175 --> 00:17:43,939
Not that I didn't think
everything was gonna be wonderful...

222
00:17:44,112 --> 00:17:46,842
...but now I'm positive. Thanks.

223
00:17:57,892 --> 00:18:00,588
Wait till the Dodgers get him.

224
00:18:00,762 --> 00:18:03,663
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're not setting a very good example...

225
00:18:03,831 --> 00:18:06,231
...for our little guests from P.S. 65.

226
00:18:06,401 --> 00:18:10,804
They must be back at their own school in
about an hour, so let's settle down now.

227
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,201
Does anyone know
why Johann Sebastian Bach...

228
00:18:15,376 --> 00:18:17,469
...is called the father of modern music?

229
00:18:17,645 --> 00:18:19,909
On account of counterpoint, natch.

230
00:18:21,716 --> 00:18:25,311
Suppose we try
this two-part invention, shall we?

231
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:29,648
Leo, will you start
the introduction, please?

232
00:18:29,824 --> 00:18:31,587
Yes, Miss Fielding.

233
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,160
Now, I'm going to signal each group
when to come in.

234
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,854
Ready?

235
00:18:41,536 --> 00:18:45,529
<i>Johann Sebastian Bach in 1685</i>

236
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,937
<i>Wrote the kind of music that has</i>

237
00:18:48,109 --> 00:18:50,304
<i>Kept his memory alive</i>

238
00:18:50,478 --> 00:18:52,503
- I beg your pardon.
- Yes, may I help you?

239
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,738
Yes, ma'am.

240
00:18:53,915 --> 00:18:57,248
I was told at the armory that I
could reregister here for the draft.

241
00:18:57,418 --> 00:18:59,409
Just down the hall and turn to your right.

242
00:18:59,587 --> 00:19:01,248
Thank you very much.

243
00:19:01,422 --> 00:19:04,255
<i>You can tell it's Bach
Because the counterpoint</i>

244
00:19:04,425 --> 00:19:07,724
<i>Will tire each joint in every finger</i>

245
00:19:07,895 --> 00:19:12,923
<i>In each hand</i>

246
00:19:13,101 --> 00:19:15,194
<i>He pioneered in modern composition</i>

247
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,803
<i>And to his everlasting fame</i>

248
00:19:16,971 --> 00:19:19,531
<i>And he's held in awe
By every great musician</i>

249
00:19:19,707 --> 00:19:21,641
<i>Johann Sebastian Bach's his name</i>

250
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:25,802
<i>Time and time we've had it
Brought to our attention</i>

251
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,508
<i>That he was the father
Of two-part invention</i>

252
00:19:30,685 --> 00:19:34,143
<i>If in class you've followed me</i>

253
00:19:34,322 --> 00:19:36,381
<i>You've learned to know</i>

254
00:19:36,557 --> 00:19:39,856
<i>The two from three</i>

255
00:19:40,028 --> 00:19:41,791
<i>This is a Bach invention</i>

256
00:19:41,963 --> 00:19:44,295
<i>I have brought to your attention</i>

257
00:19:44,465 --> 00:19:47,662
<i>This is Bach's two-part invention</i>

258
00:19:47,835 --> 00:19:49,393
<i>All proposed</i>

259
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:56,203
<i>By Johann Sebastian Bach</i>

260
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:02,313
<i>All by Johann Sebastian Bach</i>

261
00:20:04,752 --> 00:20:08,085
<i>We said Johann Sebastian Bach</i>

262
00:20:09,557 --> 00:20:11,320
<i>The great Johann Sebastian Bach</i>

263
00:20:32,547 --> 00:20:34,777
<i>John Sebastian</i>

264
00:20:34,949 --> 00:20:38,817
<i>John Sebastian Bach</i>

265
00:20:38,986 --> 00:20:41,955
<i>Was his</i>

266
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:43,848
Name?

267
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:48,027
Leo, will you please take over?

268
00:20:48,196 --> 00:20:50,790
Will you kindly step into the corridor?

269
00:20:55,336 --> 00:20:58,669
- Wasn't it funny, my meeting you here?
- I don't think it's funny at all.

270
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,933
Think of all the places
there are in Brooklyn.

271
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:03,441
Oh, yes, indeed,
it's an amazing coincidence.

272
00:21:03,611 --> 00:21:06,102
Congratulations.
But will you leave now, please?

273
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,714
Oh, sure, yeah.
I guess I was disturbing the kids.

274
00:21:08,883 --> 00:21:11,818
On the contrary,
it was the teacher you were disturbing.

275
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,481
You mean you're angry?

276
00:21:14,655 --> 00:21:17,647
Oh, I suppose you think
I should be flattered.

277
00:21:17,825 --> 00:21:18,849
No.

278
00:21:19,026 --> 00:21:21,221
There must be something
in that mind of yours...

279
00:21:21,395 --> 00:21:23,727
...to have made you follow me
half across the city.

280
00:21:23,898 --> 00:21:26,230
Very clever of you to have found me too.

281
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,731
I didn't follow you.

282
00:21:29,036 --> 00:21:30,060
You didn't?

283
00:21:30,238 --> 00:21:33,435
No, you see, I was looking for someone,
but it wasn't you.

284
00:21:33,608 --> 00:21:35,735
- Oh.
- See, I registered here for the draft...

285
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,343
...because I went to school here.

286
00:21:37,512 --> 00:21:39,878
Now I've got to reregister.

287
00:21:40,047 --> 00:21:42,208
- I'm sorry I bothered you.
- Well, look, you...

288
00:21:42,383 --> 00:21:45,216
You do see what I thought,
don't you, and why?

289
00:21:45,386 --> 00:21:48,947
Oh, sure, it might've been true.
I could've followed you.

290
00:21:49,123 --> 00:21:51,421
As a matter of fact,
I wanted to follow you.

291
00:21:51,592 --> 00:21:53,685
But I'm glad I didn't...

292
00:21:54,195 --> 00:21:56,925
...because you're a very mean girl.

293
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,164
Look, when you've made a mistake...

294
00:22:01,335 --> 00:22:04,065
...all you can do is admit it
and say you're sorry.

295
00:22:04,238 --> 00:22:07,139
And, well, I'm very sorry.

296
00:22:07,308 --> 00:22:10,471
Then it's okay.
Brother, you really got sore, didn't you?

297
00:22:10,645 --> 00:22:12,340
Well, so did you.

298
00:22:12,513 --> 00:22:15,107
I wouldn't have
if this had been anyplace but Brooklyn.

299
00:22:15,283 --> 00:22:17,148
Everyone's supposed to be friendly here.

300
00:22:17,318 --> 00:22:20,151
You should get over
those ideas of yours about Brooklyn.

301
00:22:20,321 --> 00:22:22,516
No one is friendly here.
Everything is horrible.

302
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,952
No nails.

303
00:22:24,525 --> 00:22:27,358
Fifty times I told you,
no nails in the wall.

304
00:22:27,528 --> 00:22:30,156
Cossack! Gestapo! Stool pigeon!

305
00:22:30,331 --> 00:22:33,266
Sticks and stones will break my bones,
but no nails.

306
00:22:33,434 --> 00:22:36,198
Hey, Nick,
aren't you gonna say hello to a guy?

307
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,634
- Have we been introduced?
- Formally.

308
00:22:38,806 --> 00:22:41,240
I'm Danny Miller.
Don't you remember me?

309
00:22:42,076 --> 00:22:44,874
<i>- Come stai?
- Molto bene.</i>

310
00:22:45,046 --> 00:22:46,308
Sure, I remember you.

311
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,211
You're the kid who used to draw them awful
pictures of me on the school building.

312
00:22:50,384 --> 00:22:53,683
But you know something?
I could never get sore.

313
00:22:53,855 --> 00:22:56,085
They looked just like me.

314
00:22:56,257 --> 00:22:59,249
Now look at you in a uniform, like a hero.

315
00:22:59,427 --> 00:23:01,327
I just got back today.

316
00:23:01,495 --> 00:23:04,123
And you came here? To see me?

317
00:23:04,298 --> 00:23:06,027
Just to see me?

318
00:23:06,467 --> 00:23:09,334
Well, how do you like that?

319
00:23:09,871 --> 00:23:13,739
Little girl, run along and put up your
posters or you'll be late for the next class.

320
00:23:13,908 --> 00:23:17,344
Only, try and make
just one hole for each one, huh?

321
00:23:17,511 --> 00:23:18,773
Yes, Nick.

322
00:23:18,946 --> 00:23:21,540
Gee, mister, you've got talent.

323
00:23:21,716 --> 00:23:23,377
Cossack. Huh!

324
00:23:23,551 --> 00:23:26,816
You know, speaking of talent,
you've got lots of it in that music room.

325
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,785
Not excluding the teacher.

326
00:23:28,956 --> 00:23:31,891
Miss Fielding here,
she sings like a nightingale.

327
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:34,926
Yes, I heard. You know, Miss Fielding,
you should be in opera.

328
00:23:35,096 --> 00:23:37,724
That's what she keeps telling
the man at the opera house.

329
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:40,333
Only the man at the opera house
keeps saying no.

330
00:23:40,501 --> 00:23:42,492
- So I gave it up.
- Oh, you didn't.

331
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,833
Oh, I did. Well, Mr. Miller, goodbye.

332
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,134
And I hope you prove
I'm wrong about Brooklyn.

333
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:50,277
- See you around sometime, huh?
- I guess so.

334
00:23:50,444 --> 00:23:53,242
It looks like I'll be here
the rest of my life.

335
00:23:54,782 --> 00:23:59,776
Uh, listen, up to now I never had a chance
to listen to anybody's war experience.

336
00:23:59,954 --> 00:24:02,718
What do you say?
I got a little flat down in the basement.

337
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:05,017
We could have some red wine,
some garlic toast.

338
00:24:05,192 --> 00:24:06,352
You like garlic toast?

339
00:24:06,527 --> 00:24:09,758
Sure, I love it. First, I've
gotta reregister for the draft.

340
00:24:09,931 --> 00:24:11,296
Oh, that's in Room 31.

341
00:24:11,465 --> 00:24:14,127
Then I'd like to find some clothes
and a place to live.

342
00:24:14,302 --> 00:24:16,964
Then how about supper?
No, that's no good.

343
00:24:17,138 --> 00:24:19,129
It's your first night home.

344
00:24:19,307 --> 00:24:21,901
I can't think of anyone
I'd rather spend it with.

345
00:24:22,076 --> 00:24:24,044
I have no family.

346
00:24:24,211 --> 00:24:25,735
- No girl?
- Uh-uh.

347
00:24:25,913 --> 00:24:27,744
- Not at all?
- Not yet.

348
00:24:27,915 --> 00:24:30,475
It's one of my ambitions, though,
soon as I settle down.

349
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:34,917
Well, speaking as one who never got one,
a girl is what you should get first.

350
00:24:35,089 --> 00:24:37,557
Then if you don't get nothing else,
it doesn't matter.

351
00:24:37,725 --> 00:24:40,353
You still got her. See you later, huh?

352
00:24:40,528 --> 00:24:41,620
Sure, and thanks, Nick.

353
00:24:42,863 --> 00:24:45,331
Hi.
- Hello.

354
00:24:46,467 --> 00:24:48,128
How do you like my new London drape?

355
00:24:48,302 --> 00:24:51,237
Comes direct from Carnahan's Swap Shop
on Atlantic Avenue.

356
00:24:51,405 --> 00:24:52,770
- You cold, Danny?
- Hm?

357
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,569
Oh, no. The smart set just isn't
wearing shirts this season, old thing.

358
00:24:56,744 --> 00:24:58,609
Little common, you know?

359
00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:02,237
Oh, couldn't find one, huh?
Come on, I'll lend you one.

360
00:25:03,117 --> 00:25:07,019
Say, Nick, you got it fixed up swell.

361
00:25:08,589 --> 00:25:12,423
I always say either you got
a feeling for homemaking or you ain't.

362
00:25:13,027 --> 00:25:14,187
A beauty, eh?

363
00:25:14,362 --> 00:25:15,488
Gee, thanks, Nick.

364
00:25:15,663 --> 00:25:18,530
The collar
has only been turned over once.

365
00:25:19,433 --> 00:25:21,765
- Can you keep a secret, Danny?
- Sure.

366
00:25:21,936 --> 00:25:23,665
You see that doily?

367
00:25:23,838 --> 00:25:26,170
I knitted that myself.

368
00:25:27,575 --> 00:25:30,100
That's just between us.

369
00:25:30,277 --> 00:25:34,145
I always feel better in the kitchen.
Maybe it's because I was born in one.

370
00:25:34,315 --> 00:25:37,148
My mother being busy
cooking spaghetti at the time.

371
00:25:37,318 --> 00:25:39,183
And speaking of spaghetti...

372
00:25:39,353 --> 00:25:42,811
...could you make...? Could you make
like this is one of them fat calves...

373
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:46,255
...they're always getting out
to welcome people home?

374
00:25:48,029 --> 00:25:51,396
Mm! There isn't a calf in the world
smells that good.

375
00:25:51,565 --> 00:25:53,396
I'm glad to hear you say that.

376
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:55,364
But tell me...

377
00:25:56,037 --> 00:25:57,766
...how did you make out today?

378
00:25:57,938 --> 00:26:01,533
After I got reregistered, I didn't have
much time to look for a place to live.

379
00:26:01,709 --> 00:26:04,303
And what little time I did have,
I couldn't find one.

380
00:26:04,478 --> 00:26:05,843
Oh, well, I'll go to a hotel.

381
00:26:06,013 --> 00:26:08,880
A hotel?
Why, the man don't know what he's saying.

382
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:12,611
Sonny, there hasn't been a hotel room
or a flat open in Brooklyn in years.

383
00:26:12,787 --> 00:26:14,414
People have to live someplace.

384
00:26:14,588 --> 00:26:19,082
Sure. They're living in gutters, in tents,
in trees, in powder rooms.

385
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,421
Why, even the cemeteries are crowded.

386
00:26:21,595 --> 00:26:23,426
And the crowds ain't all dead.

387
00:26:23,597 --> 00:26:28,091
I lived in one myself
behind Otis J. Fuller, 1810 to 1850...

388
00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:30,169
...for five days.

389
00:26:30,337 --> 00:26:34,034
And at the Museum of Natural History
on Eastern Parkway...

390
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:38,611
...there's a family by the name of Snyder
living under a brontosaurus.

391
00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:40,644
That's a prehistoric animal.

392
00:26:40,815 --> 00:26:45,115
Those Snyder babies are growing up
thinking the sky is made out of bones.

393
00:26:45,286 --> 00:26:48,653
A hotel? You're staying here with me.

394
00:26:48,823 --> 00:26:51,018
Honest, Danny,
you'd be doing me a favor.

395
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:54,127
It gets pretty lonesome sometimes.

396
00:26:54,695 --> 00:26:55,992
Okay, that's settled.

397
00:26:56,163 --> 00:26:57,755
Oh, but, Nick, I, uh...

398
00:26:57,932 --> 00:27:02,164
Mr. Chips, a houseguest we got,
and that calls for some celebration.

399
00:27:02,336 --> 00:27:05,100
<i>That's Mr. Chips, you know,
from Goodbye, Mr. Chips.</i>

400
00:27:05,272 --> 00:27:07,502
His real name is Mr. Donat.

401
00:27:07,675 --> 00:27:09,643
You're pretty sold on this guy,
aren't you?

402
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:12,745
I like him because all the kids
were crazy about him.

403
00:27:12,913 --> 00:27:15,973
I seen the picture 11 times.
I even read the book.

404
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:18,983
But nowhere does it say
why they liked him so much.

405
00:27:19,153 --> 00:27:21,212
That's easy to figure.

406
00:27:22,189 --> 00:27:23,213
For example?

407
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:26,018
Well, why do the kids in this school
like you?

408
00:27:27,728 --> 00:27:30,788
They don't. That's my affliction.

409
00:27:30,965 --> 00:27:34,401
I like them but they don't like me.

410
00:27:34,568 --> 00:27:36,399
I like you, Pop.

411
00:27:37,605 --> 00:27:40,574
To your health, Danny. Welcome home.

412
00:27:44,178 --> 00:27:48,012
As soon as I close the windows
in the gymnasium, we eat.

413
00:27:48,182 --> 00:27:49,877
Wait, I'll go with you, Pop.

414
00:27:50,885 --> 00:27:52,648
After you, mine guest.

415
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,811
After you, mine host.

416
00:28:11,238 --> 00:28:15,106
Are you all right?
How did you get in here?

417
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,971
Through the window, natch.

418
00:28:17,144 --> 00:28:18,805
He's always trying to sneak in here.

419
00:28:18,979 --> 00:28:22,779
All you gotta do is leave a window
or a door open, and right away he's in.

420
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,611
But why?

421
00:28:25,853 --> 00:28:28,287
What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?

422
00:28:28,455 --> 00:28:30,548
He's a little fella, littler than the others.

423
00:28:30,724 --> 00:28:33,454
And he keeps trying to exercise
so he'll grow.

424
00:28:33,627 --> 00:28:35,185
Well, gee, that's swell.

425
00:28:35,362 --> 00:28:39,230
Only I don't grow. So, what's the use?

426
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,267
You've got ants? You can't wait?

427
00:28:42,436 --> 00:28:44,597
Don't worry, son. You'll grow.

428
00:28:44,772 --> 00:28:46,967
But how do I know?

429
00:28:47,474 --> 00:28:49,738
Well, look,
you just can't wish for things alone.

430
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,071
- You've gotta work for them.
- And work hard.

431
00:28:52,246 --> 00:28:54,806
Some things you just don't get
a written guarantee with.

432
00:28:54,982 --> 00:28:56,415
Listen to Danny.

433
00:28:56,584 --> 00:28:59,382
You see, you gotta believe certain things.

434
00:28:59,553 --> 00:29:01,748
I believe a lot of things I can't prove.

435
00:29:01,922 --> 00:29:03,321
Like what?

436
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:06,084
Well, like, uh...

437
00:29:06,694 --> 00:29:09,663
<i>I believe, I believe</i>

438
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:12,765
<i>I believe in wishing wells</i>

439
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:16,664
<i>And I also believe in a lot of things</i>

440
00:29:16,837 --> 00:29:19,169
<i>Things the daisy tells</i>

441
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,332
<i>I believe, I believe</i>

442
00:29:22,509 --> 00:29:25,478
<i>That a four-leaf clover brings</i>

443
00:29:25,646 --> 00:29:29,412
<i>Lots of luck, lots of joy
Lots of happiness</i>

444
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:32,074
<i>I believe these things</i>

445
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,013
<i>And when it's Christmas</i>

446
00:29:35,189 --> 00:29:38,386
<i>I believe in Santa Claus</i>

447
00:29:39,193 --> 00:29:40,854
<i>Why do I believe?</i>

448
00:29:41,028 --> 00:29:44,725
<i>I guess that I believe because</i>

449
00:29:44,898 --> 00:29:48,356
<i>I believe, I believe</i>

450
00:29:48,535 --> 00:29:51,333
<i>I believe that dreams come true</i>

451
00:29:51,505 --> 00:29:55,236
<i>If you'll wish for the dream
By the wishing well</i>

452
00:29:55,409 --> 00:29:58,810
<i>Don't tell the wish
Or you'll break the spell</i>

453
00:29:58,979 --> 00:30:01,413
<i>It may sound naive</i>

454
00:30:01,582 --> 00:30:04,745
<i>But that's what I believe</i>

455
00:30:07,588 --> 00:30:09,783
<i>I believe, I believe</i>

456
00:30:09,957 --> 00:30:12,152
<i>In the stars that sail the sky</i>

457
00:30:12,326 --> 00:30:14,760
<i>I believe in the sign of the zodiac</i>

458
00:30:14,928 --> 00:30:16,919
<i>Yes, and Gemini</i>

459
00:30:17,097 --> 00:30:19,292
<i>I believe, I believe</i>

460
00:30:19,466 --> 00:30:21,730
<i>That your luck will show again</i>

461
00:30:21,902 --> 00:30:24,700
<i>If you manage to borrow a rabbit's foot</i>

462
00:30:24,872 --> 00:30:27,170
<i>For your pocket chain</i>

463
00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:29,138
<i>I knew a gypsy</i>

464
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,676
<i>And her skill with the cards was great</i>

465
00:30:31,845 --> 00:30:35,576
<i>Once I held three kings
But they're no good against a straight</i>

466
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,614
<i>I, I believe</i>

467
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:40,913
<i>That it's all within your heart</i>

468
00:30:41,088 --> 00:30:43,613
<i>Once you've learned how to smile
With an empty purse</i>

469
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:46,055
<i>You're richer than all the universe</i>

470
00:30:46,226 --> 00:30:47,955
<i>Rainbows up your sleeve</i>

471
00:30:48,128 --> 00:30:50,392
<i>And that's what I believe</i>

472
00:30:53,033 --> 00:30:55,263
<i>I believe, I believe</i>

473
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,734
<i>I believe I'm 6-foot-2</i>

474
00:30:57,905 --> 00:31:00,806
<i>I believe I can break any guy in half</i>

475
00:31:00,974 --> 00:31:02,601
<i>Any guy like you</i>

476
00:31:02,776 --> 00:31:05,108
<i>I believe, I believe</i>

477
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,509
<i>I'm as charming as can be</i>

478
00:31:07,681 --> 00:31:10,616
<i>I can see all the girls in the neighborhood</i>

479
00:31:10,784 --> 00:31:13,082
<i>Running after me</i>

480
00:31:13,253 --> 00:31:15,187
<i>Aladdin had a lamp</i>

481
00:31:15,356 --> 00:31:17,756
<i>He rubbed it quite a lot</i>

482
00:31:17,925 --> 00:31:19,449
<i>I don't need a lamp</i>

483
00:31:19,626 --> 00:31:22,618
<i>I only need the faith I've got</i>

484
00:31:22,796 --> 00:31:24,787
<i>I believe, I believe</i>

485
00:31:24,965 --> 00:31:27,297
<i>I believe the world is mine</i>

486
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:30,164
<i>Oh, I don't like to brag but I feel I can</i>

487
00:31:30,337 --> 00:31:32,635
<i>Out-super men like the Superman</i>

488
00:31:32,806 --> 00:31:34,865
<i>It may sound naive</i>

489
00:31:35,042 --> 00:31:37,374
<i>But that's what I believe</i>

490
00:33:05,165 --> 00:33:07,497
You didn't get the job, huh?

491
00:33:08,135 --> 00:33:11,593
For two weeks I've been trying to
get up enough courage to see my old boss.

492
00:33:11,772 --> 00:33:14,707
Today I saw him. And he was swell too.

493
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:17,435
I told him I didn't wanna be
a shipping clerk anymore...

494
00:33:17,611 --> 00:33:19,806
...that I wanted to sell the music,
and he said:

495
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,278
"Fine. All you gotta do
is audition for the job...

496
00:33:22,449 --> 00:33:24,849
...and if you're good enough, it's yours. "

497
00:33:25,018 --> 00:33:27,316
So you sang for him, huh?

498
00:33:27,688 --> 00:33:29,679
No, I didn't even bother to try.

499
00:33:29,857 --> 00:33:31,449
It's no use, Nick.

500
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:35,652
Whenever I have to sing before strangers,
I just freeze up.

501
00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:37,428
I'll just be a shipping clerk.

502
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,623
Oh, Danny, don't say that.

503
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,098
Don't worry. It'll be all right.

504
00:33:43,303 --> 00:33:46,466
Well, I gotta clean the music room.

505
00:33:47,007 --> 00:33:49,407
Are you just gonna sit there?

506
00:33:49,576 --> 00:33:52,340
Yeah, I got some thinking to do, Pops.
Don't worry about me.

507
00:33:52,513 --> 00:33:54,378
Worry about you? Ha!

508
00:33:54,548 --> 00:33:57,813
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be great.

509
00:34:34,955 --> 00:34:37,446
Oh, Leo, that was beautiful.

510
00:34:37,624 --> 00:34:39,285
Do you know you have a great future?

511
00:34:39,459 --> 00:34:42,758
Yeah.
Working in my mother's candy store.

512
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:46,161
Oh, but surely you plan
to go on with your music.

513
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:48,233
Perhaps if someone
spoke with your mother.

514
00:34:48,402 --> 00:34:50,029
Mom doesn't need any talking to.

515
00:34:50,203 --> 00:34:52,899
She's dying
because I can't go on studying.

516
00:34:53,073 --> 00:34:57,237
Look, it's tough on her
working in that store alone.

517
00:34:57,411 --> 00:34:59,606
When I graduate in June, it's gotta stop.

518
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,214
But, Leo,
if you kept on with your music...

519
00:35:02,382 --> 00:35:04,441
...someday you could do
so much more for her.

520
00:35:04,618 --> 00:35:08,554
Yeah. But what happens
between now and someday?

521
00:35:08,722 --> 00:35:10,121
- Hey, Leo.
- Yeah?

522
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,985
Excuse me for butting in.

523
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:14,457
Can't you get
one of them scholarships someplace?

524
00:35:14,628 --> 00:35:17,028
They just take care
of your tuition at music school.

525
00:35:17,197 --> 00:35:20,689
I'd still need books and clothes
and a decent piano.

526
00:35:20,867 --> 00:35:24,530
And I can't let Mom go on working
15 hours a day to get them for me.

527
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,400
It's my turn to help her.

528
00:35:26,573 --> 00:35:30,236
But doesn't the Brooklyn Music Forum
give a scholarship that includes money...

529
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:31,707
...and quite a lot of money?

530
00:35:31,878 --> 00:35:34,346
Yeah, that scholarship comes up
every five years.

531
00:35:34,514 --> 00:35:37,506
They're giving it this year,
just a couple of weeks away.

532
00:35:37,684 --> 00:35:40,517
Well, that's wonderful.
You're gonna try for it, of course.

533
00:35:40,687 --> 00:35:44,418
No. You have to be 17 to be eligible.

534
00:35:44,591 --> 00:35:47,151
I'm only 16 and a half.

535
00:35:47,628 --> 00:35:49,459
Gee, I wish I could help you.

536
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:52,599
What's the use of talking?
I can't even help myself.

537
00:35:52,766 --> 00:35:56,031
For two years now,
I've been trying to get a new mop.

538
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,437
Annie, what about you?

539
00:36:01,608 --> 00:36:04,475
You didn't mean it
when you said you were giving up singing.

540
00:36:04,645 --> 00:36:06,738
Didn't you do good at them auditions?

541
00:36:06,913 --> 00:36:08,540
Oh, all right, I guess.

542
00:36:08,715 --> 00:36:11,206
Only the man said my voice was cold.

543
00:36:11,385 --> 00:36:13,785
What does that mean?
That you need more schmaltz?

544
00:36:13,954 --> 00:36:15,717
I don't know, Nick.

545
00:36:15,889 --> 00:36:18,517
How do you warm up a cold soprano?

546
00:36:18,692 --> 00:36:20,353
I wish I knew.

547
00:36:20,527 --> 00:36:24,122
Well, it's not that tragic.
So I'm a little miserable.

548
00:36:24,297 --> 00:36:28,495
Leo is miserable
and everybody in Brooklyn is miserable.

549
00:36:30,671 --> 00:36:33,834
By the way, how is your protégé,
Mr. Miller?

550
00:36:34,007 --> 00:36:35,099
Miserable.

551
00:36:35,275 --> 00:36:37,869
Not getting that job
knocked all the bounce out of him.

552
00:36:38,045 --> 00:36:39,569
Oh, that's too bad.

553
00:36:39,746 --> 00:36:42,544
You know, maybe he should do something
to raise his spirit...

554
00:36:42,716 --> 00:36:45,583
...like go dancing or go to the movies
or something like that.

555
00:36:45,752 --> 00:36:47,777
Oh, Annie, would you?

556
00:36:47,954 --> 00:36:50,980
Oh, Nick, I couldn't.
I haven't even been asked.

557
00:36:51,158 --> 00:36:53,217
He wouldn't have the nerve,
but I'm asking.

558
00:36:53,393 --> 00:36:55,918
If you just dropped in for a minute,
say, after supper.

559
00:36:56,096 --> 00:36:59,361
Why, just your coming in to see him
would puff him right up.

560
00:36:59,533 --> 00:37:02,366
He thinks you're stupefying.

561
00:37:02,536 --> 00:37:05,437
He's awfully low, Annie. Honest.

562
00:37:05,605 --> 00:37:08,836
Well, what time
do you finish supper, Nick?

563
00:37:14,748 --> 00:37:17,717
Hey, Nick,
don't you do those dishes without me.

564
00:37:17,884 --> 00:37:20,785
You don't have to help me.
I like dirty dishes.

565
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:26,382
That's very pretty.

566
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,551
Isn't it, though? That's Jamie's music.

567
00:37:28,729 --> 00:37:31,596
I put some words to it
coming over on the boat.

568
00:37:33,533 --> 00:37:38,835
<i>Time after time</i>

569
00:37:39,973 --> 00:37:45,172
<i>I tell myself that I'm</i>

570
00:37:45,345 --> 00:37:52,342
<i>So lucky to be loving you</i>

571
00:37:56,156 --> 00:38:00,559
<i>So lucky to be</i>

572
00:38:01,194 --> 00:38:05,153
<i>The one you run to see</i>

573
00:38:05,332 --> 00:38:09,564
<i>In the evening</i>

574
00:38:09,736 --> 00:38:16,733
<i>When the day is through</i>

575
00:38:19,012 --> 00:38:25,178
<i>I only know</i>

576
00:38:25,352 --> 00:38:28,719
<i>What I know</i>

577
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:32,791
<i>The passing years will show</i>

578
00:38:33,827 --> 00:38:38,389
<i>You've kept my love so young</i>

579
00:38:39,466 --> 00:38:43,664
<i>So new</i>

580
00:38:43,837 --> 00:38:49,139
<i>And time after time</i>

581
00:38:50,443 --> 00:38:55,608
<i>You'll hear me say that I'm</i>

582
00:38:56,983 --> 00:39:00,441
<i>So lucky</i>

583
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:07,617
<i>To be loving you</i>

584
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:22,674
That's very nice.
You feel better now, huh?

585
00:39:22,843 --> 00:39:24,708
Yeah, sure.

586
00:39:24,878 --> 00:39:27,847
I kind of gave myself a good talking to.

587
00:39:28,014 --> 00:39:31,279
You see, I kept thinking how different
things would be when I got back.

588
00:39:31,451 --> 00:39:33,783
Of course, the only thing
I didn't figure was me...

589
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:36,081
...that I'd be the same guy
I was when I left.

590
00:39:36,256 --> 00:39:39,453
A little guy not sure of very much.

591
00:39:40,894 --> 00:39:44,660
Maybe someday I'll be a big guy. Until
then I'll take the shipping-clerk job.

592
00:39:44,831 --> 00:39:45,855
Oh, Danny.

593
00:39:46,032 --> 00:39:49,297
I'll be the greatest shipping clerk
you ever saw, and I'll like it too.

594
00:39:49,469 --> 00:39:52,336
Because you don't get what you want
doesn't mean it's no good.

595
00:39:52,505 --> 00:39:53,995
Yeah, that's right.

596
00:39:54,174 --> 00:39:56,165
You know somebod...?

597
00:39:56,343 --> 00:39:58,641
You know somebody
I'd wish you'd talk to?

598
00:39:58,812 --> 00:40:00,803
- Annie.
- Anne Fielding?

599
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:04,212
Yeah, she's given up singing
on account of they say her voice is cold.

600
00:40:04,384 --> 00:40:06,750
And of top of that, she hates her job.

601
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,788
Teaching kids?
How can anyone hate teaching kids?

602
00:40:10,957 --> 00:40:14,688
It ain't what she wanted.
She's pretty miserable.

603
00:40:14,861 --> 00:40:17,591
I got a feeling
she just goes home and sits.

604
00:40:17,764 --> 00:40:19,595
Like she's hiding from everybody.

605
00:40:19,766 --> 00:40:22,462
Oh, that's no good.
She's gotta get out more often...

606
00:40:22,636 --> 00:40:25,196
...and go to parties
or a dance or a movie or something.

607
00:40:25,372 --> 00:40:27,135
That's what I keep telling her.

608
00:40:27,307 --> 00:40:31,209
I think if you'd talk to her,
she might listen to you.

609
00:40:31,378 --> 00:40:35,144
She likes you.
She thinks you're stupefying.

610
00:40:35,315 --> 00:40:38,079
- Oh, now wait a minute.
- Well, she asked me about you.

611
00:40:38,251 --> 00:40:40,276
Could it be that you asked her about me?

612
00:40:40,453 --> 00:40:42,114
Believe me...

613
00:40:42,289 --> 00:40:43,984
Believe me, she asked me first and, uh...

614
00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:49,488
The doorbell. I wonder who that could be.

615
00:40:49,663 --> 00:40:53,394
It could be Miss Fielding,
coming to cheer up the Lonely Hearts Club.

616
00:40:53,566 --> 00:40:55,534
It could be.

617
00:40:55,702 --> 00:40:59,536
And if it is, it's like with good intentions.

618
00:40:59,706 --> 00:41:02,197
So nobody will act like a stinker.

619
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:04,002
Don't worry, Pop. Nobody will.

620
00:41:08,415 --> 00:41:12,545
- Hello, Nick.
- Why, Annie, what a surprise.

621
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:15,017
I thought I'd drop in
and beg a cup of coffee.

622
00:41:15,188 --> 00:41:16,917
Beg a cup of coffee?

623
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:20,389
Why, you can have the coffee
and the coffee pot.

624
00:41:21,328 --> 00:41:23,228
Look, Danny, company.

625
00:41:23,396 --> 00:41:25,159
- Hello.
- Hello.

626
00:41:25,332 --> 00:41:28,563
Oh, Annie, excuse me.
I gotta go close the windows in the gym.

627
00:41:28,735 --> 00:41:30,362
Uh, uh, uh...

628
00:41:30,537 --> 00:41:31,663
But, Danny, the windows.

629
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:35,638
But, Nick, the company. Aren't you
gonna ask Miss Fielding to sit down?

630
00:41:35,809 --> 00:41:38,937
Oh, sure. Annie, won't you sit down?

631
00:41:39,112 --> 00:41:42,343
We have some fresh coffee on the stove.
I'll get you some.

632
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:47,386
Oh, well, here we are.

633
00:41:49,923 --> 00:41:53,620
I hear Brooklyn isn't turning out
quite as well as you expected.

634
00:41:53,793 --> 00:41:56,694
I know it's discouraging,
but don't be depressed, after all...

635
00:41:56,863 --> 00:42:00,594
Look, Miss Fielding, you're awfully nice,
but please don't worry about me.

636
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:01,995
I'm doing fine.

637
00:42:02,168 --> 00:42:05,296
From what Nick tells me, you're
the one that's been going to pieces.

638
00:42:05,472 --> 00:42:07,667
Hating your job
and giving up your singing.

639
00:42:07,841 --> 00:42:09,809
Why, you ought to be ashamed.

640
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:12,139
Maybe they're right about your voice.

641
00:42:12,312 --> 00:42:13,745
Shh! Danny, Danny.

642
00:42:13,913 --> 00:42:17,542
If you hate teaching kids,
that's probably why your voice is cold.

643
00:42:17,717 --> 00:42:21,517
Maybe it'd warm up if you took some
interest in them instead of just yourself.

644
00:42:21,688 --> 00:42:25,954
You know, most people want something
and they're never happy until they get it.

645
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:29,618
And instead of enjoying themselves
while working to get what they want...

646
00:42:29,796 --> 00:42:31,923
...they go around being miserable
all the time.

647
00:42:32,098 --> 00:42:34,362
And that's what you're doing.
That's your trouble.

648
00:42:34,934 --> 00:42:37,027
Oh, so that's my trouble, is it?

649
00:42:37,203 --> 00:42:39,467
I suppose you're the person
to straighten me out.

650
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:41,231
This ain't turning out just right.

651
00:42:41,408 --> 00:42:43,376
What about you
and your dreams of Brooklyn?

652
00:42:43,543 --> 00:42:46,137
What are you doing?
You're just sitting here sulking.

653
00:42:46,312 --> 00:42:49,839
- I've decided what to do now.
- Tell other people how to run their lives...

654
00:42:50,016 --> 00:42:53,213
...because it's easier than
running your own? Thank you very much.

655
00:42:53,386 --> 00:42:55,684
Oh, Nick, I'm sorry. Good night.

656
00:43:03,096 --> 00:43:05,656
All I've got to say is "wow. "

657
00:43:05,832 --> 00:43:08,266
You know,
you might be good for her singing.

658
00:43:08,435 --> 00:43:10,300
You made her awfully mad.

659
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:14,338
Hmm. Would you say offhand
I made a very good impression?

660
00:43:14,507 --> 00:43:16,532
She'll be back to apologize.

661
00:43:16,709 --> 00:43:19,109
I give her 10 minutes.

662
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,415
- Uh-uh.
- You'll see. She likes you.

663
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:24,777
How can you tell?

664
00:43:24,951 --> 00:43:28,114
What's the matter with you?
Haven't you never been to the movies?

665
00:43:28,288 --> 00:43:30,722
Take the hero and the heroine.
How do they start out?

666
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:32,858
Fighting, like you and Annie.

667
00:43:33,026 --> 00:43:35,859
Why? Because they won't admit
they like each other.

668
00:43:36,029 --> 00:43:37,257
Well, I admit I like her.

669
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:39,660
So all you gotta do
is wait for her to admit it.

670
00:43:39,833 --> 00:43:41,425
How long can you live?

671
00:43:41,601 --> 00:43:45,731
What she's doing now
is called fighting the heart.

672
00:43:45,905 --> 00:43:48,032
In other words...

673
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:50,574
There ain't no other words. Ten minutes.

674
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:54,604
Two minutes.

675
00:43:54,781 --> 00:43:57,944
- Nick, it couldn't be.
- No? Who do you think it is?

676
00:43:58,118 --> 00:44:00,143
The Dukedom of Dunstable, maybe?

677
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,413
Come to see Brooklyn,
the borough of your dreams.

678
00:44:12,665 --> 00:44:15,429
I say, old boy, how do you do?

679
00:44:16,136 --> 00:44:17,535
Perhaps you don't remember me.

680
00:44:17,971 --> 00:44:20,599
Sure, sure I do. Jamie, come on in.

681
00:44:22,642 --> 00:44:25,110
- What are you doing here in Brooklyn?
- Well, I just...

682
00:44:25,278 --> 00:44:27,178
How's Pop? I mean, how's the duke?

683
00:44:27,347 --> 00:44:28,575
Very well, thank you.

684
00:44:28,748 --> 00:44:32,775
Gee, it's good to see you.
Let me look at you.

685
00:44:34,387 --> 00:44:36,150
It don't look like Annie to me.

686
00:44:36,322 --> 00:44:38,381
Jamie, this is Nick Lombardi,
my best friend.

687
00:44:38,558 --> 00:44:40,025
Nick, this is Jamie Shellgrove.

688
00:44:40,193 --> 00:44:43,560
From England?
The one who's gonna be a duke?

689
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:47,461
It's a pleasure
to meet Your Dukedom's acquaintance.

690
00:44:47,634 --> 00:44:49,864
That can't be right.
What do you call him?

691
00:44:50,036 --> 00:44:51,628
Jamie. How do you do?

692
00:44:51,804 --> 00:44:53,294
How do you do?

693
00:44:53,473 --> 00:44:55,771
Boy, that's so classy.

694
00:44:55,942 --> 00:44:57,705
Come on, sit down
and tell us why you're here.

695
00:44:59,078 --> 00:45:00,545
Oh, excuse me.

696
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:06,483
Oh, Danny, I'm terribly sorry.
Will you please forgive me?

697
00:45:06,653 --> 00:45:08,280
I didn't mean anything I said.

698
00:45:08,454 --> 00:45:10,251
You came back.

699
00:45:10,423 --> 00:45:13,756
Gee, so much is happening to me today.

700
00:45:13,927 --> 00:45:16,122
There's someone I want you to meet.

701
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:19,860
Anne, this is Jamie Shellgrove,
my friend from England.

702
00:45:20,033 --> 00:45:21,466
Jamie, this is Anne Fielding.

703
00:45:21,634 --> 00:45:23,033
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

704
00:45:23,203 --> 00:45:24,465
I've heard a lot about you.

705
00:45:24,637 --> 00:45:27,265
Danny cabled and said he'd met
the most beautiful girl.

706
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,341
- Oh, Danny.
- Jamie just arrived today.

707
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:33,308
I'd better run.
You must have a great deal to talk about.

708
00:45:33,479 --> 00:45:34,741
- Please don't...
- Please don't...

709
00:45:36,115 --> 00:45:37,810
Did you ever...?

710
00:45:37,984 --> 00:45:40,418
Did you ever run into a man
by the name of Mr. Chips?

711
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:42,212
Come on, Nick. Let's all sit down.

712
00:45:42,388 --> 00:45:44,720
Let's give Jamie a chance
to tell us why he's here.

713
00:45:44,891 --> 00:45:48,554
Okay. You and me
will have a little talk later.

714
00:45:49,495 --> 00:45:52,555
Well, I'm afraid that sending
that cable was rather unwise of you.

715
00:45:52,732 --> 00:45:54,324
Hearing how well you were doing...

716
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,866
...crystallized Grandfather's
dissatisfaction with me.

717
00:45:57,036 --> 00:45:58,833
Crystallized.

718
00:45:59,439 --> 00:46:02,897
I'm living.
Don't your grandfather like you?

719
00:46:03,076 --> 00:46:05,237
Like him?
Why, the duke's crazy about him.

720
00:46:05,411 --> 00:46:07,276
Only he wishes I were more like Danny.

721
00:46:07,447 --> 00:46:08,471
Like Danny?

722
00:46:08,648 --> 00:46:11,981
Yes, you know,
forceful, confident and effectual.

723
00:46:12,151 --> 00:46:13,812
Effectual.

724
00:46:13,987 --> 00:46:17,388
He has a very fine command
of the English language.

725
00:46:18,658 --> 00:46:21,923
Well, when your cable came, Danny,
it started Grandfather thinking.

726
00:46:22,095 --> 00:46:24,529
There I was, he said,
muddling about with my music...

727
00:46:24,697 --> 00:46:27,757
...and here you are, finding
exactly the job of work you wanted...

728
00:46:27,934 --> 00:46:31,199
...making friends, meeting people.

729
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:33,931
Oh, it made him
very dissatisfied with me.

730
00:46:34,107 --> 00:46:35,131
So?

731
00:46:35,308 --> 00:46:37,936
So he remembered your last words.

732
00:46:38,344 --> 00:46:40,403
- My last words?
- Yes, before you left.

733
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:44,380
"Send him over," you said to Grandfather,
"I'll straighten him out. I'll fix him up. "

734
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:46,040
That's what you said.

735
00:46:46,219 --> 00:46:47,243
That's what I said.

736
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:50,583
Yes. So that's what he did.

737
00:46:51,157 --> 00:46:53,921
So he sent you over to me
to straighten you out, huh?

738
00:46:54,093 --> 00:46:56,926
Well, what does he want done,
eh, old chap?

739
00:46:57,096 --> 00:46:59,690
I haven't the vaguest idea.
Danny, do you know?

740
00:46:59,866 --> 00:47:00,890
Yeah, I know.

741
00:47:01,601 --> 00:47:02,693
Can you do it?

742
00:47:03,136 --> 00:47:07,129
You don't think for a moment that I have
the slightest intention of imposing on you.

743
00:47:07,307 --> 00:47:11,368
I'll stay in Brooklyn for a few days
just to satisfy Grandfather.

744
00:47:11,544 --> 00:47:14,775
Well, besides, I rather think I'd like it.

745
00:47:14,947 --> 00:47:18,383
That would be fine.
Except that it wouldn't be so fine.

746
00:47:18,551 --> 00:47:21,213
The old man's got a right
to expect something to happen...

747
00:47:21,387 --> 00:47:23,719
...because I told him it would,
and he believed me.

748
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:26,723
Well, do you think
you can do what he expects?

749
00:47:28,127 --> 00:47:32,120
If I can't, at least I want him to know
it's my fault and not Jamie's.

750
00:47:32,298 --> 00:47:33,890
There are some things I told you...

751
00:47:34,067 --> 00:47:36,763
Oh, Danny, I... I've got to be going.

752
00:47:36,936 --> 00:47:40,702
And, well, I'm very happy to have met you
and I do hope I'll see you again.

753
00:47:40,873 --> 00:47:42,397
I hope you'll like Brooklyn too.

754
00:47:42,575 --> 00:47:45,237
Oh, I love it. I love it already.

755
00:47:45,411 --> 00:47:48,403
Good night, Nick.
Thank you for the wonderful cup of coffee.

756
00:47:48,581 --> 00:47:51,550
It has been my pleasure, old girl.

757
00:47:54,487 --> 00:47:55,954
I was gonna tell him the truth.

758
00:47:56,122 --> 00:47:58,113
Why? Why not help him instead?

759
00:47:58,291 --> 00:48:01,488
All he needs is a little loosening up,
and that should be simple.

760
00:48:01,661 --> 00:48:03,720
Don't you remember what you said
a while ago?

761
00:48:03,896 --> 00:48:05,523
That I can't even run my own life.

762
00:48:05,698 --> 00:48:09,634
Remember what you said a little while ago?
Maybe it'd help if you took an interest...

763
00:48:09,802 --> 00:48:13,260
...in someone else's problem
instead of just your own.

764
00:48:13,439 --> 00:48:15,270
Good night, Danny.

765
00:48:49,308 --> 00:48:50,900
I say, old bean.

766
00:48:51,077 --> 00:48:52,567
Nick.

767
00:48:54,981 --> 00:48:56,972
I underslept.

768
00:48:57,583 --> 00:48:59,016
What's the matter, Danny?

769
00:48:59,185 --> 00:49:01,050
Him. Jamie.

770
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:04,951
How can I help him
when he finds out what a bust I am?

771
00:49:05,758 --> 00:49:09,455
Why don't you try for that job?
Why don't you try just once more?

772
00:49:09,629 --> 00:49:12,496
If you sing Jamie's song
like you sang it this afternoon...

773
00:49:12,665 --> 00:49:14,530
...you'll murder them.
- Ah.

774
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,565
I know just what'll happen, Nick.

775
00:49:16,736 --> 00:49:19,864
I'll find myself thinking,
"Who said you can sing?"

776
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:22,405
And there I'd be all alone.
And I'd be dead.

777
00:49:22,575 --> 00:49:24,236
What if you wasn't alone?

778
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:25,570
What if I was with you...

779
00:49:25,745 --> 00:49:29,340
...and you were singing to me,
your friend, your pal?

780
00:49:29,515 --> 00:49:32,484
Say, Nick, that might work out all right.

781
00:49:32,652 --> 00:49:34,176
Sure it would.

782
00:49:34,353 --> 00:49:35,945
With things as rotten as they are.

783
00:49:36,122 --> 00:49:37,453
It can't be worse.

784
00:49:43,329 --> 00:49:46,730
Would you be good enough to tell
Mr. Dobson I'm here to audition for him?

785
00:49:46,899 --> 00:49:49,026
Would you be good enough
to tell me your name?

786
00:49:49,202 --> 00:49:50,362
You know very well...

787
00:49:50,536 --> 00:49:55,439
Listen, sonny, tell him that
Daniel Webson Miller is here to see him.

788
00:49:57,710 --> 00:49:59,610
Like a wounded swan.

789
00:49:59,779 --> 00:50:01,644
Now all you gotta do is sing.

790
00:50:04,617 --> 00:50:06,915
What's the matter? You scared?

791
00:50:07,753 --> 00:50:10,221
Well, don't you think
I ought to be a little bit...

792
00:50:10,389 --> 00:50:12,550
...with all this jive stuff around here?

793
00:50:12,725 --> 00:50:14,454
What chance have I got with a ballad?

794
00:50:14,627 --> 00:50:17,425
All the chance in the world.
It doesn't matter what you sing.

795
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:22,364
The important thing is, whatever you sing,
it's gotta come from the heart.

796
00:50:22,535 --> 00:50:24,230
Come with me.

797
00:50:25,071 --> 00:50:27,767
It's a good thing I came along.

798
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:31,103
Take Crosby.
What made him the singer of the age?

799
00:50:31,511 --> 00:50:32,944
- His voice.
- That helped.

800
00:50:33,112 --> 00:50:34,602
But it was really his heart.

801
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:37,544
And Jolson,
what put him over on the stage?

802
00:50:37,717 --> 00:50:38,775
His voice?

803
00:50:38,951 --> 00:50:40,646
You don't understand.

804
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:44,381
<i>It's heart that made them all</i>

805
00:50:44,557 --> 00:50:48,721
<i>It's the difference between the big
And the small</i>

806
00:50:52,231 --> 00:50:55,098
<i>It doesn't have to be witty or smart</i>

807
00:50:55,268 --> 00:50:59,466
<i>Just as long as it comes
From the heart</i>

808
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:02,403
<i>It doesn't have to be classic or art</i>

809
00:51:02,575 --> 00:51:06,136
<i>Just as long as it comes
From the heart</i>

810
00:51:06,312 --> 00:51:09,975
<i>Just put more heart into your voice</i>

811
00:51:10,149 --> 00:51:13,607
<i>And you'll become the people's choice</i>

812
00:51:13,786 --> 00:51:16,914
<i>Just make up your mind
From the start</i>

813
00:51:17,089 --> 00:51:21,526
<i>That the song's gotta come
From the heart</i>

814
00:51:21,694 --> 00:51:26,290
Why, only last year the kids asked me
to sing at their graduation exercises.

815
00:51:26,465 --> 00:51:29,229
I did. But I made a ghastly mistake.

816
00:51:29,402 --> 00:51:31,199
I didn't sing from the heart.

817
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:33,099
I sang from the nose.

818
00:51:33,272 --> 00:51:35,035
- Well, how did it sound?
- I don't know.

819
00:51:35,207 --> 00:51:36,765
The note hasn't come out yet.

820
00:51:36,943 --> 00:51:40,504
<i>Just make up your mind
From the start</i>

821
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:45,014
<i>That the song's gotta come
From the heart</i>

822
00:51:50,423 --> 00:51:52,357
I could use a longer piano.

823
00:51:53,559 --> 00:51:56,551
Let's take the world's great love songs.

824
00:51:56,729 --> 00:52:00,130
What makes everybody melt
when they hear them?

825
00:52:00,733 --> 00:52:02,132
Heart.

826
00:52:02,301 --> 00:52:04,360
For example.

827
00:52:16,983 --> 00:52:18,382
You see what I mean, Danny?

828
00:52:18,551 --> 00:52:21,213
Now, try and follow me in this one.

829
00:52:48,481 --> 00:52:49,505
Yeah.

830
00:53:11,737 --> 00:53:14,399
Believe me, that's got heart.

831
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,312
Hey.

832
00:53:30,189 --> 00:53:31,816
Hey!

833
00:53:32,425 --> 00:53:36,054
<i>Don't be afraid
You'll make the grade</i>

834
00:53:36,228 --> 00:53:40,130
<i>Why, you can sing
As good as Bing</i>

835
00:53:40,299 --> 00:53:43,530
<i>That's why I say when you start</i>

836
00:53:43,703 --> 00:53:47,434
<i>That the song is gotta come
From the heart</i>

837
00:53:47,606 --> 00:53:49,904
Sing it, Danny. Make me proud.

838
00:53:50,076 --> 00:53:52,909
Okay, Nick. Stand back.

839
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:55,741
<i>It doesn't have to be witty or smart</i>

840
00:53:55,915 --> 00:53:56,939
Smile.

841
00:53:57,116 --> 00:53:58,708
<i>Long as it comes
From the heart</i>

842
00:53:58,884 --> 00:54:00,545
Keep going.

843
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,211
<i>It doesn't have to be classic or art</i>

844
00:54:03,389 --> 00:54:04,413
Great.

845
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:06,421
<i>Long as it comes
From the heart</i>

846
00:54:06,592 --> 00:54:07,616
The kid's murder.

847
00:54:07,793 --> 00:54:09,954
<i>I'll give them that</i>

848
00:54:10,129 --> 00:54:11,460
<i>I'll give them this</i>

849
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:13,325
<i>I'll strut away</i>

850
00:54:13,499 --> 00:54:15,558
Boy, you can't miss.

851
00:54:15,735 --> 00:54:17,794
<i>Just put a star on my chart</i>

852
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:19,232
They won't need this anymore.

853
00:54:19,405 --> 00:54:21,464
<i>Because the song's gonna come
From the heart</i>

854
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:22,902
Don't work cheap.

855
00:54:23,075 --> 00:54:24,770
<i>- On opening nights
- On opening nights</i>

856
00:54:24,944 --> 00:54:26,809
<i>- Your name in lights
- Your name in lights</i>

857
00:54:26,979 --> 00:54:30,540
<i>Why we won't stop
Till you reach the top</i>

858
00:54:30,716 --> 00:54:33,446
<i>We'll order our meals à la carte</i>

859
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:34,643
That's expensive.

860
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:37,186
<i>If the song comes
From the heart</i>

861
00:54:37,356 --> 00:54:38,448
<i>We'll be tremendous</i>

862
00:54:38,624 --> 00:54:41,218
<i>If the song comes
From the heart</i>

863
00:54:41,393 --> 00:54:42,485
They'll holler, "bravo. "

864
00:54:42,661 --> 00:54:49,157
<i>If the song comes From the heart</i>

865
00:54:51,036 --> 00:54:54,437
<i>Heart</i>

866
00:54:55,307 --> 00:54:56,331
Miller.

867
00:54:58,911 --> 00:55:00,173
That was wonderful.

868
00:55:00,346 --> 00:55:02,678
You can start to work Monday morning.

869
00:55:02,848 --> 00:55:05,078
Gee, thank you very much,
Mr. Dobson.

870
00:55:05,251 --> 00:55:06,878
That's all right.

871
00:55:07,653 --> 00:55:10,622
- What did I tell you?
- Oh, thanks, Nick.

872
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:13,918
Say, we ought to get Anne and Jamie
and go someplace and celebrate.

873
00:55:14,093 --> 00:55:16,288
Sure, only I can't go along.

874
00:55:16,462 --> 00:55:19,898
I gotta go to a meeting
of the Custodian Benevolent Society.

875
00:55:20,065 --> 00:55:21,999
Well, can't you skip it for now?

876
00:55:22,168 --> 00:55:24,432
It don't look good
if the treasurer don't show up.

877
00:55:24,603 --> 00:55:30,269
And besides, you got no idea
how catty those janitors can be. Huh-huh!

878
00:55:36,982 --> 00:55:38,916
Oh, I must say this is really delightful.

879
00:55:39,084 --> 00:55:41,109
Let's drink to Danny's new job, shall we?

880
00:55:41,287 --> 00:55:43,380
This time next year,
president of the company.

881
00:55:43,556 --> 00:55:46,320
Oh, this time next year,
president and owner of the company.

882
00:55:46,492 --> 00:55:50,326
Oh, but, of course, forgive me, Danny.
President and owner.

883
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,700
Okay, now that I'm all set.

884
00:55:56,869 --> 00:55:59,064
Still some unfinished business
before the house.

885
00:55:59,238 --> 00:56:01,172
Namely, i. e., Jamie.

886
00:56:02,341 --> 00:56:05,504
Move that we table the problem of Jamie
at least until after dinner.

887
00:56:05,678 --> 00:56:09,341
Well, I must say, that at this moment,
you don't look very much like a problem.

888
00:56:09,515 --> 00:56:12,643
I must say, at this moment,
I don't feel very much like a problem.

889
00:56:12,818 --> 00:56:16,618
There's one thing that will make me
forget Jamie's future and that's spaghetti.

890
00:56:16,789 --> 00:56:18,916
Speaking of spaghetti,
what's with the waiter?

891
00:56:19,091 --> 00:56:22,891
We're in no hurry. Let's live dangerously.

892
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:38,176
Go on, Anne. Sing some more, please.

893
00:56:38,344 --> 00:56:40,107
- No, I can't.
- Why?

894
00:56:40,279 --> 00:56:43,510
Because some idiot said she had
a cold voice, that's why.

895
00:56:43,682 --> 00:56:44,706
Whatever that means.

896
00:56:44,884 --> 00:56:48,149
Well, it was no idiot. It was the director
of the Brooklyn Music Forum.

897
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,584
You're not gonna take
one man's opinion, are you?

898
00:56:50,756 --> 00:56:52,917
You know better.
You've gotta keep trying.

899
00:56:53,092 --> 00:56:54,821
Well, I'm tired of trying.

900
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:58,987
To get ahead in music, you have
to know someone and someone important.

901
00:56:59,164 --> 00:57:01,291
You can't just walk in and sing.

902
00:57:01,467 --> 00:57:04,527
Why not? If you're good.
If you know you're good.

903
00:57:04,703 --> 00:57:07,035
Lately I'm beginning to think
they may be right...

904
00:57:07,206 --> 00:57:09,572
...that there is something missing
in my singing.

905
00:57:09,742 --> 00:57:13,303
- Well, I think your voice is beautiful.
- Oh, but you haven't really heard it.

906
00:57:13,479 --> 00:57:17,506
- I've heard enough to know it's beautiful.
- You can't know from what you've heard.

907
00:57:17,683 --> 00:57:19,548
Well, go on. Sing something else.

908
00:57:19,718 --> 00:57:22,812
Yeah, go ahead. I dare you, Annie.

909
00:57:22,988 --> 00:57:27,152
Well, I never let anyone dare me.
And don't you call me Annie.

910
00:57:27,893 --> 00:57:29,155
Okay.

911
00:57:29,328 --> 00:57:31,762
I double dare you, Annie.

912
00:57:31,931 --> 00:57:33,193
Now, look, Danny Miller, I...

913
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,828
<i>Don Giovanni.</i>

914
00:57:36,001 --> 00:57:37,730
- Go ahead. I'm listening.
- So am I.

915
00:57:37,903 --> 00:57:40,133
- But that's a duet.
- Well?

916
00:57:40,306 --> 00:57:42,740
You don't expect me to sing
a duet by myself, do you?

917
00:57:42,908 --> 00:57:45,468
- Is that the only thing that's stopping you?
- Yes.

918
00:57:45,644 --> 00:57:47,544
- Well?
- Well?

919
00:57:47,713 --> 00:57:50,147
Ahem. Well.

920
01:01:10,682 --> 01:01:12,309
Well, well, Jamie.

921
01:01:12,484 --> 01:01:14,315
Hello, Nick.

922
01:01:14,486 --> 01:01:17,580
What are you doing here alone?
Boy, this is my chance.

923
01:01:17,756 --> 01:01:20,418
I got questions to ask you
about Mr. Chips.

924
01:01:20,592 --> 01:01:23,026
Hey, where's Danny?
Where's the Brooklyn thrush?

925
01:01:23,195 --> 01:01:25,925
- He's taking Anne home.
- Ahh!

926
01:01:26,098 --> 01:01:28,566
<i>L 'amour toujours, I'amour.</i>

927
01:01:28,734 --> 01:01:31,066
<i>Oh, yes. L 'amour toujours, I'amour.</i>

928
01:01:31,236 --> 01:01:32,931
You're quoting me.

929
01:01:34,173 --> 01:01:37,540
Maybe there's a streak of royalty
in my blood, huh?

930
01:01:37,709 --> 01:01:42,169
Say, that's a very fine chateau.

931
01:01:42,347 --> 01:01:43,780
You know we...

932
01:01:43,949 --> 01:01:45,541
You know...

933
01:01:46,385 --> 01:01:48,979
You know we gotta start rounding up
a doll for you.

934
01:01:49,154 --> 01:01:50,178
A doll?

935
01:01:50,355 --> 01:01:55,850
A chick or as they was known in my youth,
a sweet patootie.

936
01:01:56,028 --> 01:01:58,963
Nick, there are so many new things
to get used to in Brooklyn...

937
01:01:59,131 --> 01:02:01,463
...I think it's a little soon
for a sweet patootie.

938
01:02:01,633 --> 01:02:04,727
The only way to see a town
is with a girl hanging on your arm.

939
01:02:04,903 --> 01:02:10,500
Jamie, maybe Danny would let you
borrow Anne for sightseeing purposes.

940
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:13,434
She likes him quite a lot, doesn't she?

941
01:02:13,612 --> 01:02:16,240
And he's crazy about her.

942
01:02:16,415 --> 01:02:17,439
Quite.

943
01:02:17,616 --> 01:02:20,210
Nick, you were asking me
about Mr. Chips...

944
01:02:20,385 --> 01:02:23,616
Jamie, if we could only find you
a girl like Anne.

945
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:28,481
Look, Nick, why don't you try this on?
It's never suited me.

946
01:02:29,094 --> 01:02:32,120
Do you think this type lid
would do something for my personality?

947
01:02:32,297 --> 01:02:35,266
I think your personality
would do something for the, uh, lid.

948
01:02:35,434 --> 01:02:37,368
Lend it a little dash, shall we say?

949
01:02:37,803 --> 01:02:39,430
Ahh.

950
01:02:47,779 --> 01:02:50,213
We was made for each other.

951
01:02:50,382 --> 01:02:52,111
It becomes you, Nick. It's yours.

952
01:02:52,284 --> 01:02:55,253
In return, I'm gonna try
and find you a girl like Anne.

953
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:58,548
Think how swell it'd be,
walking her home like Danny does...

954
01:02:58,724 --> 01:03:01,420
...sitting on her front stoop,
whispering sweet nothings...

955
01:03:01,593 --> 01:03:04,562
...and talking over your plans with her.

956
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:08,860
If I had a girl like Anne, I think
I'd want to talk about her all the time.

957
01:03:09,034 --> 01:03:11,229
There's so many things I'd wanna know.

958
01:03:11,403 --> 01:03:14,167
When she was a little girl,
did she wear pigtails...

959
01:03:14,339 --> 01:03:16,364
...or big bows in her hair?

960
01:03:16,541 --> 01:03:19,601
Did she wear high-button shoes
and hate them?

961
01:03:20,212 --> 01:03:23,272
You know, romantic little things like that.

962
01:03:23,448 --> 01:03:27,680
That's what I'd wanna know if I was sitting
on the front stoop with a girl like Anne.

963
01:03:27,853 --> 01:03:30,219
Gee, if we could only find a girl for him.

964
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:33,984
Oh, I know you wanna do a lot for Jamie,
but, honestly, Danny...

965
01:03:34,159 --> 01:03:37,993
...I don't see where your getting a girl
for him is quite the right way.

966
01:03:38,163 --> 01:03:41,030
After all,
a man has to get a girl for himself.

967
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:43,531
But Jamie's much too shy. He never will.

968
01:03:43,702 --> 01:03:45,636
Oh, I don't know.

969
01:03:45,804 --> 01:03:47,897
He doesn't even talk
when he's with strangers.

970
01:03:48,073 --> 01:03:50,064
A girl would never notice him.

971
01:03:50,242 --> 01:03:52,733
Oh, I don't know.

972
01:03:52,911 --> 01:03:55,971
Here I've been sitting here doing nothing
but talking about Jamie.

973
01:03:56,148 --> 01:03:57,740
Well, after all it's only natural.

974
01:03:57,916 --> 01:04:02,148
He's your friend and, well,
I don't mind talking about Jamie.

975
01:04:02,321 --> 01:04:07,224
I know, but there was so much
I wanted to say about you and me.

976
01:04:07,793 --> 01:04:10,887
- That's awfully nice, Danny, but I...
- Oh, please, Anne, don't go.

977
01:04:11,063 --> 01:04:12,257
But, Danny, it's late.

978
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:14,399
There are 25 schoolteachers
living here...

979
01:04:14,566 --> 01:04:17,467
...and you don't want them talking
about my coming in after midnight?

980
01:04:17,636 --> 01:04:19,001
Oh, of course not.

981
01:04:19,171 --> 01:04:22,766
Good night, Danny,
it's been a wonderful evening.

982
01:04:24,343 --> 01:04:26,868
Gee, I guess we're going
steady now, huh? Hey?

983
01:04:38,357 --> 01:04:39,619
You got any records for me?

984
01:04:39,791 --> 01:04:43,693
We wanna play them all over again.
You picked out some beauts.

985
01:04:49,668 --> 01:04:51,727
Johnny, your mother called
about three times.

986
01:04:51,903 --> 01:04:55,031
- I think you'd better make some tracks.
- I'll go right home, Danny.

987
01:04:55,607 --> 01:04:57,666
Emil, how'd you like
those records I got you?

988
01:04:57,843 --> 01:05:00,505
Ma says if I play that once more,
she's gonna leave home.

989
01:05:00,679 --> 01:05:03,204
- But she likes it too.
- Hey, Danny?

990
01:05:03,382 --> 01:05:05,782
Wait a minute, kids.
I'll get him to sing it for us.

991
01:05:05,951 --> 01:05:09,284
Say, Danny, will you sing this one for me?
I can't read music, you know?

992
01:05:09,454 --> 01:05:10,682
- Which one?
- This one.

993
01:05:10,856 --> 01:05:13,825
- Come on, all the booths are filled.
- We can't get to hear anything.

994
01:05:13,992 --> 01:05:15,118
That's right.

995
01:05:15,293 --> 01:05:19,024
You might be late for supper, and I'll
have every mother in Brooklyn on my neck.

996
01:05:19,197 --> 01:05:21,631
Okay, I'll do it for you. Come on.

997
01:05:29,975 --> 01:05:32,739
<i>I can see a steeple</i>

998
01:05:32,911 --> 01:05:36,278
<i>Surrounded by people</i>

999
01:05:36,448 --> 01:05:41,112
<i>Oh, how real it all starts to seem</i>

1000
01:05:41,686 --> 01:05:44,951
<i>Just as the choir is singing</i>

1001
01:05:45,123 --> 01:05:47,785
<i>My alarm starts ringing</i>

1002
01:05:47,959 --> 01:05:53,829
<i>It's the same old dream</i>

1003
01:05:53,999 --> 01:06:00,029
<i>And then my thoughts
inspire A scene by the fire</i>

1004
01:06:00,205 --> 01:06:05,472
<i>In a cottage close by a stream</i>

1005
01:06:05,644 --> 01:06:09,171
<i>I know it all by heart now</i>

1006
01:06:09,347 --> 01:06:11,907
<i>We're about to part now</i>

1007
01:06:12,083 --> 01:06:16,679
<i>It's the same old dream</i>

1008
01:06:16,855 --> 01:06:19,881
<i>If you but knew</i>

1009
01:06:20,058 --> 01:06:25,587
<i>How many times I pretend
That I'm with you</i>

1010
01:06:25,764 --> 01:06:29,359
<i>I know your heart would unbend</i>

1011
01:06:29,534 --> 01:06:32,059
<i>You'd see me through</i>

1012
01:06:32,237 --> 01:06:38,733
<i>Until my dream Had a happy ending</i>

1013
01:06:41,713 --> 01:06:44,648
<i>And I can picture clearly</i>

1014
01:06:44,816 --> 01:06:47,751
<i>The things I love dearly</i>

1015
01:06:47,919 --> 01:06:53,118
<i>And in the center
You reign supreme</i>

1016
01:06:53,825 --> 01:06:56,919
<i>We kiss and I discover</i>

1017
01:06:57,095 --> 01:07:00,223
<i>That I'm the lonesome lover</i>

1018
01:07:00,398 --> 01:07:05,665
<i>It's the same old dream</i>

1019
01:07:13,245 --> 01:07:14,872
Well?

1020
01:07:19,317 --> 01:07:20,978
Didn't like the song, huh?

1021
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,148
Well, maybe you didn't like
the way I did it.

1022
01:07:25,457 --> 01:07:28,790
Suppose you take a crack at it.
Let me see what you can do with it.

1023
01:07:36,902 --> 01:07:39,598
<i>I can see a steeple</i>

1024
01:07:39,771 --> 01:07:41,102
<i>Surrounded by people</i>

1025
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,866
<i>Oh, see how real it starts to seem</i>

1026
01:07:46,545 --> 01:07:48,240
<i>Get the choir singing</i>

1027
01:07:48,413 --> 01:07:51,041
<i>And then
My clock starts ringing</i>

1028
01:07:51,216 --> 01:07:54,617
<i>It's the same old dream</i>

1029
01:07:55,954 --> 01:08:00,482
<i>My thoughts inspire
Scenes by the fire</i>

1030
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:03,719
<i>In a cottage close
By a rippling stream</i>

1031
01:08:03,895 --> 01:08:05,294
<i>Be rippling</i>

1032
01:08:05,463 --> 01:08:07,294
<i>You know it by heart now</i>

1033
01:08:07,465 --> 01:08:09,797
<i>We're just about to part now</i>

1034
01:08:09,968 --> 01:08:13,369
<i>It's the same old dream
Slightly off the beam</i>

1035
01:08:13,538 --> 01:08:18,373
<i>The same old dream</i>

1036
01:08:19,844 --> 01:08:23,974
Well, that's swell, for kids your age...

1037
01:08:24,749 --> 01:08:27,912
...but when you get to be my age,
why, you mellow a little bit.

1038
01:08:28,086 --> 01:08:30,850
As a matter of fact,
you enjoy doing it this way.

1039
01:08:31,022 --> 01:08:35,356
<i>If you but knew</i>

1040
01:08:35,527 --> 01:08:39,964
<i>How many times I pretend</i>

1041
01:08:40,131 --> 01:08:42,861
<i>That I'm with you</i>

1042
01:08:43,034 --> 01:08:46,731
<i>I know your heart would unbend</i>

1043
01:08:46,905 --> 01:08:49,669
<i>You'd see me through</i>

1044
01:08:49,841 --> 01:08:52,674
<i>Until my dream</i>

1045
01:08:52,844 --> 01:08:58,180
<i>Had a happy ending</i>

1046
01:09:01,453 --> 01:09:04,911
<i>And I can picture clearly</i>

1047
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:09,288
<i>The things I love dearly</i>

1048
01:09:09,461 --> 01:09:14,660
<i>In the center
You reign supreme</i>

1049
01:09:15,567 --> 01:09:19,765
<i>We kiss and I discover</i>

1050
01:09:19,938 --> 01:09:22,930
<i>I'm a lonesome lover</i>

1051
01:09:23,108 --> 01:09:29,536
<i>It's the same old dream</i>

1052
01:09:29,714 --> 01:09:34,151
<i>It's the same</i>

1053
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:40,815
<i>Old dream</i>

1054
01:09:47,932 --> 01:09:50,059
Does that mean
that someone's gonna buy a copy?

1055
01:09:50,235 --> 01:09:51,361
Oh, I am.
I am. I am.

1056
01:09:51,536 --> 01:09:52,969
Over there.

1057
01:09:59,344 --> 01:10:01,471
- Good work.
- Thank you very much.

1058
01:10:01,646 --> 01:10:03,944
Oh, excuse me a moment.

1059
01:10:04,115 --> 01:10:05,377
- Hi, Jamie
- Hello, Danny.

1060
01:10:05,550 --> 01:10:06,812
What do you think happened?

1061
01:10:06,985 --> 01:10:09,044
Since I've been here,
business has picked up.

1062
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:12,018
It's as it should be.
You're almost finished for the day?

1063
01:10:12,190 --> 01:10:13,919
Yeah. Oh, I mean, no, no.

1064
01:10:14,092 --> 01:10:16,959
Mr. Dobson wants to talk to me
about something very important.

1065
01:10:17,128 --> 01:10:21,030
- And I'll probably be stuck here for a while.
- But, Danny, Anne's coming for dinner.

1066
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:25,067
Yes, I know. Would you do me a favor
and keep her company until I get home?

1067
01:10:25,236 --> 01:10:28,865
- She talks about you constantly anyway...
- What an extraordinary waste of time.

1068
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,907
- Run along and I'll see you in a little while.
- Right. Bye.

1069
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:37,475
And if you like it now, Jamie, wait
till you get a load of it in the winter.

1070
01:10:37,649 --> 01:10:41,517
After a snowstorm,
that's when it's beautiful.

1071
01:10:41,686 --> 01:10:43,779
The ice on the sidewalk.

1072
01:10:43,955 --> 01:10:45,422
And then the thaw.

1073
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:47,785
The sawdust tripping you up.

1074
01:10:47,959 --> 01:10:50,291
The muddy slush in the gutters...

1075
01:10:50,462 --> 01:10:53,795
...and my three brothers,
the street cleaners, shoveling it up...

1076
01:10:53,965 --> 01:10:58,493
...and then the snowballs
flying around your head.

1077
01:10:58,670 --> 01:11:00,228
Them little murderers.

1078
01:11:01,139 --> 01:11:03,835
Ah, Brooklyn in the wintertime.

1079
01:11:04,008 --> 01:11:05,976
What time of year
do you like best, Jamie?

1080
01:11:06,144 --> 01:11:07,509
Oh, springtime I think.

1081
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:10,170
Oh, really?
Isn't that funny because I do too.

1082
01:11:10,348 --> 01:11:13,545
Really? What an amazing coincidence.

1083
01:11:13,718 --> 01:11:17,085
Spring? I got nothing against spring.

1084
01:11:17,255 --> 01:11:18,449
I enjoy it.

1085
01:11:18,623 --> 01:11:20,523
We got a tree here in Brooklyn.

1086
01:11:20,692 --> 01:11:23,160
You should see the dogwood blossoms
in England in May.

1087
01:11:23,328 --> 01:11:26,786
You should see the dogwood blossoms
right here in Prospect Park in May.

1088
01:11:26,965 --> 01:11:29,832
- I hope you'll show them to me.
- You ain't eating nothing.

1089
01:11:30,001 --> 01:11:32,595
What's the matter?
Did I cook with a heavy hand?

1090
01:11:32,771 --> 01:11:35,865
- Oh, no, Nick, it's just that I...
- Then why ain't you eating?

1091
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:37,667
- I don't know.
- I'll tell you what.

1092
01:11:37,842 --> 01:11:39,036
Go into the parlor...

1093
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:41,269
...or rather the drawing room...

1094
01:11:42,914 --> 01:11:44,745
...and I'll bring you in the coffee.

1095
01:11:44,916 --> 01:11:46,110
Right.

1096
01:11:51,389 --> 01:11:54,290
You know, it's really been wonderful
getting to know you, Anne.

1097
01:11:54,459 --> 01:11:56,893
- Why?
- Oh, I don't know. It...

1098
01:11:57,061 --> 01:12:00,189
Well, we've hardly talked, really,
and all we know about each other...

1099
01:12:00,365 --> 01:12:02,993
...is that we both like springtime best.

1100
01:12:03,168 --> 01:12:05,728
Well, if we did talk...

1101
01:12:05,904 --> 01:12:09,840
...a great deal, I mean, I imagine
we'd find we like all the same things.

1102
01:12:10,008 --> 01:12:12,806
- So do I.
- Do you really?

1103
01:12:12,977 --> 01:12:15,275
Do you really, Anne?

1104
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:24,614
A catastrophe.

1105
01:12:24,789 --> 01:12:27,553
This ain't according to the plans.

1106
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:30,389
What to do?

1107
01:12:30,562 --> 01:12:32,826
What to do?

1108
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:39,534
Mr. Chips, you never had this problem.

1109
01:12:39,704 --> 01:12:42,798
Your kids were smaller than my Danny.

1110
01:12:43,908 --> 01:12:45,398
Danny.

1111
01:12:45,577 --> 01:12:48,842
I gotta go find Danny.

1112
01:12:49,013 --> 01:12:53,473
- What's the matter, Nick?
- I ran out of sugar.

1113
01:12:56,120 --> 01:13:00,181
It's funny, Danny said
you were too shy to talk to girls.

1114
01:13:00,358 --> 01:13:04,692
Oh, not since I've been over here,
not since I met you.

1115
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:10,333
Jamie, if you liked someone
a great deal...

1116
01:13:10,501 --> 01:13:12,969
...you wouldn't be afraid
to tell her so, would you?

1117
01:13:13,137 --> 01:13:15,037
Oh, no. No.

1118
01:13:15,206 --> 01:13:19,506
I think if I liked someone a great deal,
I'd want to talk about it all the time.

1119
01:13:19,677 --> 01:13:20,871
I'd want to tell her how...

1120
01:13:22,213 --> 01:13:24,841
How things I had taken for granted
seem wonderful...

1121
01:13:25,016 --> 01:13:27,814
...and how everything
seemed to mean more.

1122
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:31,217
Music and words
and even people's faces.

1123
01:13:31,389 --> 01:13:36,952
Oh, how different everything is
when you like someone a great deal.

1124
01:13:37,128 --> 01:13:39,460
- Anne?
- Yes, Jamie?

1125
01:13:40,865 --> 01:13:45,700
Jamie. Jamie. Everything's so great,
I can't stand it. I can't stand it.

1126
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:48,134
- Hello, Annie. Look.
- Hello.

1127
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,603
- Well, what is it?
- It's your song.

1128
01:13:50,775 --> 01:13:53,573
- The circles are for our pictures.
- But I never wrote a song.

1129
01:13:53,745 --> 01:13:56,009
Of course you did.
You didn't know that you did.

1130
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:59,946
- You thought it was a funeral march.
- Oh, Jamie, that's wonderful.

1131
01:14:00,118 --> 01:14:02,518
- You mean this is...?
- Yeah, yeah. This is your song.

1132
01:14:02,687 --> 01:14:06,020
I put words to it and I played it
for Mr. Dobson, and he loved it.

1133
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:09,182
And he's gonna publish it.
Why, you're a big success, that's all.

1134
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,885
Oh, Danny. Jamie, isn't that wonderful?

1135
01:14:12,063 --> 01:14:14,463
Look, I hope you're not sore
that I put words to it.

1136
01:14:14,632 --> 01:14:18,068
I didn't change the melody at all, honest.
It's just the way you wrote it.

1137
01:14:18,236 --> 01:14:20,898
- Oh, I'm not, it's just...
- Let me play it for you.

1138
01:14:21,072 --> 01:14:23,404
Anne, sing it for him, won't you?

1139
01:14:25,043 --> 01:14:27,511
The music is Jamie's
and the words are mine...

1140
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:29,579
...and they're for you.

1141
01:14:36,754 --> 01:14:41,248
<i>Time after time</i>

1142
01:14:41,426 --> 01:14:43,894
<i>I tell myself</i>

1143
01:14:44,062 --> 01:14:48,431
<i>That I'm so lucky</i>

1144
01:14:48,599 --> 01:14:52,729
<i>To be loving you</i>

1145
01:14:55,873 --> 01:14:58,433
<i>So lucky</i>

1146
01:14:58,609 --> 01:15:05,105
<i>To be The one you run to see</i>

1147
01:15:05,550 --> 01:15:10,078
<i>In the evening</i>

1148
01:15:10,254 --> 01:15:16,750
<i>When the day is through</i>

1149
01:15:18,229 --> 01:15:23,064
<i>I only know</i>

1150
01:15:23,234 --> 01:15:25,065
<i>What I know</i>

1151
01:15:26,137 --> 01:15:30,267
<i>The passing years will show</i>

1152
01:15:31,376 --> 01:15:37,178
<i>You've kept my love
So young</i>

1153
01:15:37,348 --> 01:15:41,785
<i>So new</i>

1154
01:15:41,953 --> 01:15:47,653
<i>Time after time</i>

1155
01:15:47,825 --> 01:15:50,919
<i>You'll hear me say</i>

1156
01:15:51,095 --> 01:15:57,591
<i>That I'm so lucky</i>

1157
01:15:58,870 --> 01:16:05,867
<i>To be loving you</i>

1158
01:16:16,254 --> 01:16:19,155
Oh, it's beautiful. It's perfectly beautiful.

1159
01:16:19,323 --> 01:16:21,223
- It's wonderful, Danny.
- Wonderful?

1160
01:16:21,392 --> 01:16:23,792
Why, it's better than that.
It's gonna be published.

1161
01:16:23,961 --> 01:16:26,828
Do you realize how tough it is today
to have a song published?

1162
01:16:26,998 --> 01:16:28,795
It's yours too, we're partners.

1163
01:16:28,966 --> 01:16:30,991
Shellgrove and Miller.

1164
01:16:31,169 --> 01:16:34,536
Why, we might even worry
Rodgers and Hammerstein a little bit.

1165
01:16:34,705 --> 01:16:38,300
I hope you've got more funeral marches
because Mr. Dobson wants to see us.

1166
01:16:38,476 --> 01:16:41,001
<i>We're gonna get a quick start
on your career:</i>

1167
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:46,475
I can't, Danny.
I'm going back to England.

1168
01:16:48,252 --> 01:16:50,447
Why, you don't know what you're saying.

1169
01:16:50,621 --> 01:16:52,919
You can't leave now.
We're just getting started.

1170
01:16:53,091 --> 01:16:55,321
Don't you think I ought to get started
in my own country?

1171
01:16:55,493 --> 01:16:56,517
I think that...

1172
01:16:57,895 --> 01:17:00,455
Look, we'll talk about this some more.

1173
01:17:01,032 --> 01:17:02,829
Anne, I...

1174
01:17:04,769 --> 01:17:08,261
Oh, please do excuse me, but I have
been told that the teacher is here.

1175
01:17:08,439 --> 01:17:09,804
Miss Fielding, the teacher.

1176
01:17:09,974 --> 01:17:13,034
Why, yes, she is. Won't you come in?

1177
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:17,605
Anne, this lady would like to see you.

1178
01:17:17,782 --> 01:17:19,477
This is Miss Fielding.

1179
01:17:19,650 --> 01:17:21,709
Oh, please excuse that I, uh...

1180
01:17:21,886 --> 01:17:23,353
Uh...

1181
01:17:23,688 --> 01:17:25,849
I'm Mrs. Kardos. I'm Leo's mother.

1182
01:17:26,023 --> 01:17:29,117
Leo's mother? Well, I'm so happy
to meet you, Mrs. Kardos.

1183
01:17:29,293 --> 01:17:31,386
Leo's the best pupil I've ever had.

1184
01:17:31,562 --> 01:17:35,328
This is Danny Miller
and this is Jamie Shellgrove, Mrs. Kardos.

1185
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,627
So happy. So happy.

1186
01:17:37,802 --> 01:17:40,066
If you'd like to speak alone,
Jamie and I could...

1187
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:41,899
Oh, no, no.

1188
01:17:42,073 --> 01:17:47,807
Now that I'm here, I think perhaps
it's wrong for me to come.

1189
01:17:47,979 --> 01:17:50,277
Of course not.
We're so happy to have you.

1190
01:17:50,448 --> 01:17:53,076
Please sit down, Mrs. Kardos.

1191
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:59,289
Miss Fielding,
I want to speak to you about Leo.

1192
01:17:59,457 --> 01:18:01,448
You must be very proud of Leo,
Mrs. Kardos.

1193
01:18:01,626 --> 01:18:03,253
He has such great talent.

1194
01:18:03,427 --> 01:18:05,918
What will he do with this talent?

1195
01:18:06,097 --> 01:18:09,931
And if he does nothing,
this talent will ruin his life.

1196
01:18:10,101 --> 01:18:11,898
Anne, I don't understand.

1197
01:18:12,069 --> 01:18:14,367
Well, Leo can't afford to go on
with his music...

1198
01:18:14,539 --> 01:18:16,006
...after he leaves high school.

1199
01:18:16,174 --> 01:18:19,041
And there's only one scholarship
that would do him any good...

1200
01:18:19,210 --> 01:18:20,973
...and he's too young to apply for it.

1201
01:18:21,145 --> 01:18:22,908
Oh, but that's frightful.

1202
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:25,446
All day, he's so gay and cheerful.

1203
01:18:25,616 --> 01:18:29,143
"Mama," he tells me, "don't worry,
I want to work in the store with you.

1204
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:33,654
And at night, I will study by myself.
It will be fun. "

1205
01:18:34,292 --> 01:18:36,920
Fun that at night in his bed he cries.

1206
01:18:37,094 --> 01:18:40,222
That he cannot sleep, he cannot eat.

1207
01:18:40,398 --> 01:18:44,767
He's a little boy, my Leo,
but in his eyes, already he's old.

1208
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:49,098
Oh, Mrs. Kardos, I should've done more.

1209
01:18:49,273 --> 01:18:51,764
I should've tried much harder.

1210
01:18:51,943 --> 01:18:56,471
I was so disappointed
in my own music that I...

1211
01:18:57,882 --> 01:19:00,043
Oh, I should've tried harder.

1212
01:19:00,218 --> 01:19:03,051
No, no, do not feel bad. Please don't.

1213
01:19:03,221 --> 01:19:06,782
If Leo were an ordinary boy,
I could give him what he needs.

1214
01:19:06,958 --> 01:19:12,521
But to those with talent,
one owes more and this I cannot give.

1215
01:19:12,697 --> 01:19:16,497
Who is to care that a little boy
becomes artist or no? Who?

1216
01:19:16,667 --> 01:19:18,726
Who is to care?

1217
01:19:19,470 --> 01:19:24,430
You see, to be poor
and have a son like Leo...

1218
01:19:24,609 --> 01:19:27,134
...this is to be ashamed always.

1219
01:19:28,346 --> 01:19:32,646
Leo is someone for everyone to be proud
of, not just his mother but everyone.

1220
01:19:33,351 --> 01:19:35,876
You're right, he does need more
than ordinary boys...

1221
01:19:36,053 --> 01:19:37,816
...and everyone should see he gets it.

1222
01:19:37,989 --> 01:19:40,549
There must be some way to help him,
Mrs. Kardos.

1223
01:19:40,725 --> 01:19:43,250
- And we'll find it.
- You bet we will.

1224
01:19:43,427 --> 01:19:46,123
We could go to the directors
of the Brooklyn Music Forum...

1225
01:19:46,297 --> 01:19:47,821
...and explain to them and plead.

1226
01:19:47,999 --> 01:19:51,196
- You think? You think?
- We will.

1227
01:19:56,807 --> 01:20:00,766
The rule exists and if we break it at this
time, we'd be establishing a precedent.

1228
01:20:00,945 --> 01:20:04,176
Well, it seems to me the least
you could do is listen to Leo play.

1229
01:20:04,348 --> 01:20:08,216
My dear Miss Fielding, I don't
doubt that the boy's magnificent...

1230
01:20:08,386 --> 01:20:10,877
...but there's still no point
in my hearing him.

1231
01:20:11,055 --> 01:20:14,582
Because of his age, he simply
is not eligible for this scholarship.

1232
01:20:14,759 --> 01:20:16,750
I'm sorry.

1233
01:20:18,829 --> 01:20:21,662
Leo's mother was right. No one cares.

1234
01:20:21,832 --> 01:20:22,924
Now, wait a minute.

1235
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:26,831
We said last night that we gotta care,
and they will too, once they hear him.

1236
01:20:27,004 --> 01:20:29,438
They'll have to hear him.
What he needs is a concert.

1237
01:20:29,607 --> 01:20:33,236
- We'll see that he gets it.
- Oh, Danny, that's not so easy.

1238
01:20:33,411 --> 01:20:35,879
What is that's any good?

1239
01:20:36,047 --> 01:20:38,174
We'd have to have a place to give it in.

1240
01:20:38,349 --> 01:20:39,816
The music shop.

1241
01:20:39,984 --> 01:20:44,045
I know Mr. Dobson will say yes.
He's wonderful about things like that.

1242
01:20:44,221 --> 01:20:46,985
Oh, we'd have to have
someone important come to see it.

1243
01:20:47,158 --> 01:20:50,150
People whose opinions count,
you know, like critics and so forth.

1244
01:20:50,328 --> 01:20:53,195
- We'll get them.
- If we could only get that board of trustees.

1245
01:20:53,364 --> 01:20:54,991
We will. We three and Nick.

1246
01:20:55,166 --> 01:20:57,634
Is there anything we have to do
that's more important?

1247
01:20:57,802 --> 01:21:00,862
Well, Danny, you know,
to draw attention to the concert...

1248
01:21:01,038 --> 01:21:03,871
...we'd need a sponsor,
someone important.

1249
01:21:04,041 --> 01:21:07,135
- Do we know anybody important?
- No.

1250
01:21:07,311 --> 01:21:10,280
The people of Brooklyn.
That's who'll give the concert.

1251
01:21:10,448 --> 01:21:12,109
Do we know many people?

1252
01:21:12,283 --> 01:21:14,217
No, but this is a swell way to meet them.

1253
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:16,811
Here, kids, try these.

1254
01:21:16,987 --> 01:21:20,252
I should go to the city hall with Anne,
but I can't possibly leave now.

1255
01:21:20,424 --> 01:21:22,688
Mr. Dobson isn't here
and even Fodderwing's gone.

1256
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:25,124
Jamie, how about you taking charge?

1257
01:21:25,296 --> 01:21:26,763
Oh, Danny, I couldn't.

1258
01:21:26,931 --> 01:21:28,990
For Leo?

1259
01:21:29,166 --> 01:21:30,565
Well, I'll try.

1260
01:21:30,735 --> 01:21:31,793
Attaboy.

1261
01:21:31,969 --> 01:21:34,836
Hey, kids, my buddy here
is gonna take charge for about an hour...

1262
01:21:35,005 --> 01:21:36,734
...while I run out somewhere.
Oh, gee.

1263
01:21:36,907 --> 01:21:38,932
Oh, he's a wonderful guy.
Give him the breaks.

1264
01:21:39,110 --> 01:21:41,374
Jamie, don't worry about anything.
Just play loud.

1265
01:21:41,545 --> 01:21:44,309
Anne and I have some business
with His Honor.

1266
01:21:44,482 --> 01:21:46,313
Well...

1267
01:21:46,484 --> 01:21:48,509
...follow me. Ahem.

1268
01:21:53,290 --> 01:21:55,451
What are we gonna do now?

1269
01:21:57,061 --> 01:21:59,552
Well, what can I do for you,
ladies and gentlemen?

1270
01:21:59,730 --> 01:22:03,257
Nothing, unless you can play
"Whose Baby Are You?"

1271
01:22:03,434 --> 01:22:05,595
"Whose Baby?"

1272
01:22:06,637 --> 01:22:08,730
Well, where's the music?

1273
01:22:15,146 --> 01:22:18,377
I'll, uh... I'll do the best I can.

1274
01:22:24,522 --> 01:22:27,548
<i>Baby, baby</i>

1275
01:22:27,725 --> 01:22:30,216
<i>Whose baby are you?</i>

1276
01:22:30,394 --> 01:22:33,022
<i>Baby, baby</i>

1277
01:22:33,597 --> 01:22:35,963
<i>Whose baby are you?</i>

1278
01:22:36,133 --> 01:22:38,863
<i>You told me
That you'd be my love forevermore</i>

1279
01:22:39,036 --> 01:22:41,504
<i>So how come you won't let me
Hang around your door</i>

1280
01:22:41,672 --> 01:22:44,732
<i>It ain't right, it ain't right</i>

1281
01:22:44,909 --> 01:22:47,070
<i>For you to do me like you do</i>

1282
01:22:47,244 --> 01:22:50,907
<i>Oh, tell me, baby</i>

1283
01:22:51,081 --> 01:22:53,777
<i>Whose baby are you?</i>

1284
01:22:53,951 --> 01:22:56,442
<i>You order fancy dishes
Way beyond my means</i>

1285
01:22:56,620 --> 01:22:59,180
<i>And while you're caviaring
I'm content with beans</i>

1286
01:22:59,356 --> 01:23:02,348
<i>I had to break a poker game
To buy that ring</i>

1287
01:23:02,526 --> 01:23:04,994
<i>That mink may not be mink
But it's the closest thing</i>

1288
01:23:05,162 --> 01:23:08,359
<i>It ain't right, it ain't right</i>

1289
01:23:08,532 --> 01:23:11,330
<i>Spending all my money
For your fancy clothes</i>

1290
01:23:11,502 --> 01:23:14,266
<i>I even went in hock
To buy those nylon hose</i>

1291
01:23:14,438 --> 01:23:17,236
<i>And after I have bought you
All that finery</i>

1292
01:23:17,408 --> 01:23:19,876
<i>You say you look too swell
To be seen with me</i>

1293
01:23:20,044 --> 01:23:23,343
<i>It ain't right, it ain't right</i>

1294
01:23:23,514 --> 01:23:26,074
<i>For you to do me like you do</i>

1295
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:29,617
<i>Oh, tell me, baby</i>

1296
01:23:29,787 --> 01:23:35,054
<i>Whose baby are you?</i>

1297
01:24:25,910 --> 01:24:28,777
Thank you so much.
You've been wonderful and I appreciate it.

1298
01:24:28,946 --> 01:24:32,313
- Are you sure there isn't anything else?
- No, I think that's all for now.

1299
01:24:32,483 --> 01:24:35,316
- Well, we'll be back in time,
Miss Fielding. It's been fun.

1300
01:24:35,486 --> 01:24:37,716
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

1301
01:24:41,959 --> 01:24:43,153
Finished?

1302
01:24:43,327 --> 01:24:45,557
- Well, thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

1303
01:24:45,729 --> 01:24:47,993
- Is the piano all right, Jamie?
- Oh, yes, yes.

1304
01:24:48,165 --> 01:24:51,931
They're moving the concert piano up
onto the platform after dinner.

1305
01:24:52,269 --> 01:24:53,634
Ahh.

1306
01:24:53,804 --> 01:24:55,965
- Tired?
- Oh, but it's a good tired.

1307
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:58,904
Perhaps you can get a nap
before it's time for you to dress.

1308
01:24:59,076 --> 01:25:01,408
- I'll take you home.
- In a minute.

1309
01:25:01,579 --> 01:25:04,275
All I can think of is Leo
and the concert tonight.

1310
01:25:04,448 --> 01:25:07,906
Do you know I never thought I'd be able
to be near a stage or a platform...

1311
01:25:08,085 --> 01:25:11,179
...no matter how small,
without thinking of myself?

1312
01:25:11,355 --> 01:25:14,256
- About your own career?
- My ex-career.

1313
01:25:14,425 --> 01:25:18,088
About your debut,
perhaps, as a great singer?

1314
01:25:18,262 --> 01:25:19,559
At the Metropolitan.

1315
01:25:19,730 --> 01:25:23,598
And what would you sing at your debut at
the Metropolitan? Have you decided that?

1316
01:25:23,767 --> 01:25:26,668
Oh, well, that's the first thing
you do decide.

1317
01:25:27,338 --> 01:25:29,602
<i>I'd sing Lakmé.</i>

1318
01:25:31,408 --> 01:25:32,534
Sing it, Anne.

1319
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:34,405
All right.

1320
01:30:49,192 --> 01:30:51,626
Oh, it was wonderful, Anne,
just wonderful.

1321
01:30:51,795 --> 01:30:55,128
And you will come to the Kardos concert
tonight, won't you, Mr. Roberts?

1322
01:30:55,299 --> 01:30:58,029
Yes, that's fine.
You sure you have the address?

1323
01:30:58,201 --> 01:31:01,568
Dobson's Music Shop.
Good. I'll see you there.

1324
01:31:01,738 --> 01:31:03,399
Goodbye.

1325
01:31:04,408 --> 01:31:07,343
And there you are. That's the last one.

1326
01:31:07,511 --> 01:31:10,742
Why, Nick, you're a thing of beauty.

1327
01:31:10,914 --> 01:31:13,576
Grooming, that's my secret.

1328
01:31:15,152 --> 01:31:19,851
Maybe it's artistic to go to Leo's concert
like that, but is it polite?

1329
01:31:20,424 --> 01:31:23,257
How's anyone gonna notice that
with my new tie on?

1330
01:31:23,427 --> 01:31:25,361
Yuk-yuk-yuk-yuk-yuk-yuk.

1331
01:31:27,564 --> 01:31:30,829
We've got a little time yet.
Gotta wait for Jamie anyway.

1332
01:31:31,001 --> 01:31:34,061
I sure hope he got Anne to go home
and rest. She must be worn out.

1333
01:31:34,237 --> 01:31:36,034
Danny, tell me something.

1334
01:31:36,206 --> 01:31:38,197
You ain't seen Annie lately, have you?

1335
01:31:38,375 --> 01:31:40,104
I had lunch with her and Jamie today.

1336
01:31:40,277 --> 01:31:44,509
No, I mean, you ain't seen her alone
like... Like on a date.

1337
01:31:44,681 --> 01:31:46,080
Oh.

1338
01:31:46,416 --> 01:31:49,317
No, I guess I haven't.
I haven't had much time...

1339
01:31:49,486 --> 01:31:52,250
...with the concert
and all the other things I've had to do.

1340
01:31:52,422 --> 01:31:54,754
Don't it seem to you
that if you were in love...

1341
01:31:54,925 --> 01:31:57,917
...that you'd sort of make the time?

1342
01:31:58,895 --> 01:32:01,693
What are you driving at, Nick?
What's bothering you?

1343
01:32:01,865 --> 01:32:03,662
You know Anne's my girl.

1344
01:32:03,834 --> 01:32:06,234
Are you sure, Danny?

1345
01:32:06,403 --> 01:32:09,304
Maybe it's because
she was the first girl you ran into...

1346
01:32:09,473 --> 01:32:11,907
...and I sort of helped make it easy.

1347
01:32:12,075 --> 01:32:15,806
What I mean is,
are you really crazy about her?

1348
01:32:15,979 --> 01:32:18,345
Well, of course I'm crazy about her.

1349
01:32:18,515 --> 01:32:20,176
Why?

1350
01:32:20,350 --> 01:32:21,476
Why?

1351
01:32:21,651 --> 01:32:24,211
Why is anyone in love with anyone?

1352
01:32:24,388 --> 01:32:29,655
There's lots of reasons like, for example,
you like her eyes or something.

1353
01:32:29,826 --> 01:32:32,522
Of course I like her eyes.
They're beautiful.

1354
01:32:32,696 --> 01:32:34,823
What color are they?

1355
01:32:36,366 --> 01:32:38,596
Brown, dark brown.

1356
01:32:38,769 --> 01:32:41,294
Lot of people got dark-brown eyes.

1357
01:32:41,471 --> 01:32:44,133
But what's different about Annie's?

1358
01:32:44,307 --> 01:32:47,435
There doesn't have to be anything
different about Anne's eyes, Nick.

1359
01:32:47,611 --> 01:32:50,637
They're beautiful,
they're dark and I like them.

1360
01:32:51,148 --> 01:32:53,013
How tall is she compared to you?

1361
01:32:54,785 --> 01:32:56,082
Uh...

1362
01:32:56,253 --> 01:32:58,221
About, um...

1363
01:32:59,623 --> 01:33:02,387
What color nail polish does she use?

1364
01:33:02,559 --> 01:33:04,823
What kind of perfume?

1365
01:33:06,363 --> 01:33:07,830
I don't know.

1366
01:33:07,998 --> 01:33:09,989
Do you notice things like that
about people?

1367
01:33:10,167 --> 01:33:13,728
No. I ain't never been in love.

1368
01:33:14,438 --> 01:33:20,809
I thought that when you was, you saw
little things that no one else does.

1369
01:33:22,179 --> 01:33:24,409
Gee, I don't know.

1370
01:33:25,782 --> 01:33:28,774
Oh, Jamie.
- Sorry I'm late. I had to take Anne home.

1371
01:33:28,952 --> 01:33:30,852
Jamie, we're having a little argument.

1372
01:33:31,021 --> 01:33:33,717
- What color are Annie's eyes?
- Dark brown.

1373
01:33:33,890 --> 01:33:37,155
But in the light,
they've got little golden flecks.

1374
01:33:37,327 --> 01:33:38,851
How tall is she compared to you?

1375
01:33:39,029 --> 01:33:43,466
When she's wearing high heels,
she comes to here and low heels, to here.

1376
01:33:44,201 --> 01:33:47,170
Uh, what color nail polish does she use?

1377
01:33:47,337 --> 01:33:50,272
None.
Her hands are just like a little girl's.

1378
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:53,375
And that perfume she uses,
that's like a little girl's too...

1379
01:33:53,543 --> 01:33:56,239
...so clean and soapy.

1380
01:33:57,180 --> 01:33:59,045
But you know the cutest thing about her?

1381
01:33:59,216 --> 01:34:01,309
You can always tell
when she's going to smile.

1382
01:34:01,485 --> 01:34:05,751
Just a second before,
she wrinkles up her nose. Always.

1383
01:34:07,090 --> 01:34:09,581
Well, I think I better get dressed.

1384
01:34:14,564 --> 01:34:16,429
Thanks, Nick.

1385
01:34:28,111 --> 01:34:30,375
Come on, Danny.
Well, you're not even dressed yet.

1386
01:34:30,547 --> 01:34:33,311
We've gotta fetch Anne. We'll be late.

1387
01:34:33,483 --> 01:34:37,146
Jamie, you run along and pick Anne up
and I'll see you over at the music shop.

1388
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:38,947
Right.

1389
01:34:45,061 --> 01:34:47,325
I never saw anybody care
as much about anything...

1390
01:34:47,497 --> 01:34:49,192
...as Danny does about this concert.

1391
01:34:49,366 --> 01:34:50,663
He's really a wonderful guy.

1392
01:34:50,834 --> 01:34:52,825
Guy? How American you're getting.

1393
01:34:53,003 --> 01:34:55,494
Yes, you... You've said a mouthful.

1394
01:34:55,672 --> 01:34:58,004
- Jamie, let's sit down a minute.
- Right.

1395
01:35:02,179 --> 01:35:04,306
Is something wrong?

1396
01:35:04,481 --> 01:35:07,473
Something seems to be wrong.

1397
01:35:07,651 --> 01:35:11,109
Jamie, maybe you'll think
I'm a little brazen but...

1398
01:35:11,288 --> 01:35:15,384
Well, you know I'm in love with you,
don't you?

1399
01:35:15,559 --> 01:35:17,550
Don't say it, Anne.

1400
01:35:17,727 --> 01:35:20,218
Yes, I am. I'm going to say it.

1401
01:35:20,397 --> 01:35:22,024
How long must I go on pretending...

1402
01:35:22,199 --> 01:35:25,362
...that I don't know
that you're in love with me too?

1403
01:35:25,535 --> 01:35:27,969
You are, aren't you, Jamie?

1404
01:35:29,239 --> 01:35:32,470
Well, when are you
going to say something?

1405
01:35:33,210 --> 01:35:35,303
He's my best friend, Anne, I...

1406
01:35:35,478 --> 01:35:37,173
Oh, darling, that's very noble...

1407
01:35:37,347 --> 01:35:40,839
...but it's also very stupid
and very ungrown-up.

1408
01:35:41,017 --> 01:35:44,783
Don't you know that if nothing
ever happened between us that...?

1409
01:35:44,955 --> 01:35:48,118
Well, if nothing ever happened...

1410
01:35:48,291 --> 01:35:49,656
I don't love Danny.

1411
01:35:49,826 --> 01:35:52,624
So I wouldn't be any good for him,
would I?

1412
01:35:54,197 --> 01:35:56,324
Oh, Jamie.

1413
01:35:57,467 --> 01:36:01,403
This isn't easy for me.
Why don't you say something?

1414
01:36:06,843 --> 01:36:10,108
Better come along.
We'll be late for the concert.

1415
01:36:10,847 --> 01:36:12,576
Anne. Anne, you're angry.

1416
01:36:12,749 --> 01:36:17,186
I imagine in a little while I'll be
furious but right now I'm just humiliated.

1417
01:36:17,354 --> 01:36:18,946
Anne.

1418
01:36:19,122 --> 01:36:21,818
Jamie, you made it quite clear
there's nothing else to say.

1419
01:36:21,992 --> 01:36:23,721
Anne, darling, what can I do? L...

1420
01:36:23,893 --> 01:36:26,020
Let's not discuss it
the rest of the evening.

1421
01:36:26,196 --> 01:36:29,222
Let's just think about Leo
and the concert.

1422
01:38:22,212 --> 01:38:26,080
Ladies and gentlemen,
I represent the Brooklyn Music Forum...

1423
01:38:26,249 --> 01:38:29,446
...which every five years
offers a scholarship.

1424
01:38:29,619 --> 01:38:33,521
We had thought Leo Kardos
was too young to apply for it...

1425
01:38:33,690 --> 01:38:37,524
...but tonight, due to the efforts
of some Brooklyn citizens...

1426
01:38:37,694 --> 01:38:43,826
...we have decided that true musicianship
is beyond age limits or rules.

1427
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,992
Leo Kardos
is hereby awarded a scholarship...

1428
01:38:47,170 --> 01:38:51,732
...which will enable him to pursue the
study of music for the next five years.

1429
01:38:51,908 --> 01:38:54,103
- Good luck, Leo.
- Thank you.

1430
01:38:54,277 --> 01:38:57,838
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1431
01:38:58,314 --> 01:39:00,612
Now, what shall I say?

1432
01:39:00,784 --> 01:39:02,945
I know what to say.

1433
01:39:05,288 --> 01:39:10,351
If I ever get good,
it'll be because of you.

1434
01:39:10,894 --> 01:39:15,490
I'll work hard and I'll never forget you.

1435
01:39:15,665 --> 01:39:17,257
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1436
01:39:17,434 --> 01:39:19,766
Thank you and thank you all
and good night.

1437
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:23,929
Good night.
It was very wonderful. Good night.

1438
01:39:24,107 --> 01:39:26,541
- Well, sir, I guess we made it.
- I guess we did.

1439
01:39:26,709 --> 01:39:29,041
Everything you said
about Brooklyn was true, Danny.

1440
01:39:29,212 --> 01:39:31,578
I'm really gonna miss it.

1441
01:39:31,748 --> 01:39:35,240
- Why, are you going someplace, maybe?
- Yes, back to England in the morning.

1442
01:39:35,418 --> 01:39:36,544
What about your career?

1443
01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:39,051
I think I'll be able to handle it
in England now.

1444
01:39:39,222 --> 01:39:41,452
I sort of have that Brooklyn approach.

1445
01:39:41,624 --> 01:39:44,991
- Well, that's swell. What about Annie?
- Danny.

1446
01:39:45,161 --> 01:39:48,619
Have you asked whether she'd like to go?
Think she could be ready by tomorrow?

1447
01:39:48,798 --> 01:39:49,958
Danny!

1448
01:39:50,133 --> 01:39:52,897
You don't mean to tell me
you haven't asked her to marry you yet?

1449
01:39:53,069 --> 01:39:56,698
- Well, I...
- Besides being ridiculous, it's not polite.

1450
01:39:56,873 --> 01:39:59,398
But, Danny, what are you talking about?
Anne's your girl.

1451
01:39:59,576 --> 01:40:02,602
- Jamie, she's your girl.
- Anyone can see that.

1452
01:40:02,779 --> 01:40:04,747
Will you listen to me
for just one minute?

1453
01:40:04,914 --> 01:40:08,372
- Be a nice quiet little girl. Now, look here...
- I will not be quiet.

1454
01:40:08,551 --> 01:40:10,576
Okay, what have you got to say?

1455
01:40:10,753 --> 01:40:15,053
I don't want Jamie through the courtesy
of Danny Miller or Nick Lombardi.

1456
01:40:15,225 --> 01:40:18,023
In fact, I don't want Jamie.

1457
01:40:19,128 --> 01:40:20,857
Anne.

1458
01:40:27,604 --> 01:40:29,572
- Oh, I beg your pardon.
- I beg your pardon.

1459
01:40:29,739 --> 01:40:31,639
Can you tell me...?

1460
01:40:32,308 --> 01:40:33,468
- Jamie.
- Grandfather.

1461
01:40:33,643 --> 01:40:35,110
Don't go away. I'll be with you.

1462
01:40:35,278 --> 01:40:37,337
- But, Jamie...
Hey, Jamie!

1463
01:40:37,514 --> 01:40:39,345
- Danny.
- Hey, Pop.

1464
01:40:39,516 --> 01:40:42,178
Say, Nick, Jamie's grandfather.

1465
01:40:42,352 --> 01:40:45,253
Take him to Luigi's and get him a beer.

1466
01:40:46,556 --> 01:40:48,581
Oh, don't tell me.

1467
01:40:48,758 --> 01:40:51,921
Don't tell me I'm at last facing
the Dukesdom of Dunstable.

1468
01:40:52,095 --> 01:40:55,553
Why, you must be Mr. Lombardi.
How do you do?

1469
01:40:55,732 --> 01:40:57,962
How'd you...? How did you know?

1470
01:40:58,134 --> 01:40:59,761
Jamie wrote me all about you.

1471
01:40:59,936 --> 01:41:03,428
Mr. Lombardi, can you tell me
what's going on here? I mean...

1472
01:41:07,377 --> 01:41:09,140
Hello, Grandfather.

1473
01:41:09,312 --> 01:41:12,213
- Dad, this is Miss Fielding,Jamie's girl.
- How do you do?

1474
01:41:12,382 --> 01:41:15,010
Everything I said would happen to Jamie
has happened.

1475
01:41:15,184 --> 01:41:17,846
- Show Grandpop how different you are, son.
- Different?

1476
01:41:18,021 --> 01:41:21,218
- Go on.
- Well, um...

1477
01:41:23,793 --> 01:41:26,193
- See what I mean?
- He certainly has changed.

1478
01:41:26,362 --> 01:41:27,920
Thank you, Danny.

1479
01:41:28,097 --> 01:41:29,155
Oh, Danny.

1480
01:41:34,237 --> 01:41:36,398
Uh, you know something?

1481
01:41:36,573 --> 01:41:39,974
I've never had so much trouble
getting rid of a girl in my whole life.

1482
01:41:40,143 --> 01:41:43,635
- Oh, Danny, we owe you so much.
- Not me.

1483
01:41:43,813 --> 01:41:45,644
It was that nurse in England. Remember?

1484
01:41:45,815 --> 01:41:48,579
If it hadn't been for her,
I would never have talked to you.

1485
01:41:48,751 --> 01:41:50,150
Nurse? What nurse?

1486
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:51,912
You didn't tell me about no nurse.

1487
01:41:52,088 --> 01:41:54,886
Well, she was an Army nurse, Nick.
And she was from Brooklyn.

1488
01:41:55,058 --> 01:41:58,391
She wouldn't believe I was from Brooklyn
till she saw me making friends.

1489
01:41:58,561 --> 01:42:01,086
I don't know nobody
who has more friends than you.

1490
01:42:01,264 --> 01:42:04,461
- Yeah, I guess she'd believe me now.
- Plump little thing, wasn't she?

1491
01:42:04,634 --> 01:42:08,502
Oh, no, she was the kind of girl
you'd think is little and plump...

1492
01:42:08,671 --> 01:42:10,536
...but she had a terrific figure.

1493
01:42:10,707 --> 01:42:12,607
And she stood about so high.

1494
01:42:12,775 --> 01:42:16,711
And she was a blond, Nick,
she had blue eyes.

1495
01:42:16,879 --> 01:42:18,744
You know, most blue eyes are round.

1496
01:42:20,149 --> 01:42:26,418
But hers kind of slanted a little
bit on the ends, and her hands...

1497
01:42:26,589 --> 01:42:30,423
Why, Nick, did you hear what I said?

1498
01:42:30,593 --> 01:42:32,788
Did you hear me? About her I noticed.

1499
01:42:32,962 --> 01:42:35,089
That's the one. That's the one, I tell you.

1500
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:37,027
- I gotta find her.
- How?

1501
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:39,896
Well, if she's a Brooklyn nurse
she's gotta be in Brooklyn.

1502
01:42:40,069 --> 01:42:42,401
- But maybe she ain't here.
- She's gotta be here.

1503
01:42:42,572 --> 01:42:44,039
And believe me, I'll find her.

1504
01:42:44,207 --> 01:42:46,368
I'll bet you the Brooklyn Bridge I find her.

1505
01:42:46,542 --> 01:42:47,907
Sure you will, Danny.
