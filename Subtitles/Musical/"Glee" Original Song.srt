Hey, Regionals? You've just met
our opening number.

42
00:01:59,059 --> 00:02:01,278
That was so good.

43
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:02,946
How did you manage to find

44
00:02:02,947 --> 00:02:04,948
a Burberry-esque
canary cage cover?

45
00:02:04,949 --> 00:02:08,585
Canaries don't
like cold weather.

46
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,203
Especially Pavarotti.

47
00:02:10,204 --> 00:02:11,904
So, what did you
think of the song?

48
00:02:11,905 --> 00:02:13,906
Can I be really
honest with you?

49
00:02:13,907 --> 00:02:16,576
Because it comes
from a place of caring.

50
00:02:16,577 --> 00:02:17,677
Been there, done that.

51
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:20,513
Look, you're amazing, Blaine.

52
00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:22,582
Your solos are breathtaking.

53
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:23,967
They're also numerous.

54
00:02:23,968 --> 00:02:28,087
Kurt, the council decides
who gets the solos.

55
00:02:28,088 --> 00:02:30,473
Do I detect a little jealousy?

56
00:02:30,474 --> 00:02:31,608
No, you detect
a lot of jealousy.

57
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,310
Look, Blaine,

58
00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:35,195
sometimes I don't feel
like we're the Warblers.

59
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:38,198
I feel like we're
Blaine and the Pips.

00:02:43,988 --> 00:02:46,623
Okay, so, I really
took all of your notes

62
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,774
from "My Headband" to heart.

63
00:02:47,775 --> 00:02:49,909
And I... I really
tapped into my pain

64
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,411
for this second song.

65
00:02:51,412 --> 00:02:53,496
So come and sit down.

66
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:56,883
These are for you.
Just in case.

67
00:02:56,884 --> 00:02:58,835
It's pretty emotional.

68
00:02:58,836 --> 00:03:00,286
Don't be afraid,
if you need to...

69
00:03:00,287 --> 00:03:02,005
Hit it.

00:03:04,124 --> 00:03:07,126

71
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:09,796
♪ You're not going

82
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,391
It's called "Only Child."

83
00:03:54,392 --> 00:03:56,359
Yeah, I got that. Uh...

84
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,528
It's better than "My Headband,"
that's for sure.

85
00:03:59,563 --> 00:04:00,980
But it...

86
00:04:00,981 --> 00:04:03,516
It still feels like you're
just playing scared.

87
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,237
You're only dealing
with the easy pain.

88
00:04:07,238 --> 00:04:09,189
You got to get to
the hard stuff.

89
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,740
That's what's relatable
to everybody.

90
00:04:10,741 --> 00:04:12,909
I... I'm perfectly capable
of accessing my pain.

91
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,046
- I cry every time I sing a solo.
- Exactly.

92
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,081
When you sing, I can feel it.

93
00:04:18,082 --> 00:04:20,917
I guess you just got to go

94
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:23,870
inside yourself to wherever
the singing comes from,

95
00:04:23,871 --> 00:04:25,305
and write from there.

96
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,974
Have you even
ever tried to write a song?

97
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:29,726
<i>Sometimes I worry about Finn.</i>

98
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,043
<i>I mean, how damaged</i>

99
00:04:31,044 --> 00:04:33,229
<i>does a guy have to be
to be into someone</i>

100
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,181
<i>as annoying as Rachel?</i>

101
00:04:35,182 --> 00:04:37,801
<i>Still, he is a good guy,</i>

102
00:04:37,802 --> 00:04:39,769
<i>and I do really like him.</i>

103
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,970
<i>He's my first love,</i>

104
00:04:40,971 --> 00:04:43,606
<i>and first loves are forever.</i>

105
00:04:43,607 --> 00:04:45,024
<i>And another thing,</i>

106
00:04:45,025 --> 00:04:48,027
<i>without him I'm never going
to get one of these.</i>

107
00:04:48,028 --> 00:04:49,396
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

108
00:04:49,397 --> 00:04:50,580
<i>"Prom queen?</i>

109
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:53,065
<i>"You're smart and super pretty</i>

110
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:55,502
<i>"and relatively sane
for a girl.</i>

111
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:59,122
<i>Does being prom queen
really matter to you?"</i>

112
00:04:59,123 --> 00:05:00,507
<i>Well, it does.</i>

113
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,575
<i>Prom queens live, on average,</i>

114
00:05:02,576 --> 00:05:04,511
<i>five years longer
than regular people.</i>

115
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,596
<i>It's probably
because they smile a lot,</i>

116
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,933
<i>and smiling has been proven
to ward off diseases.</i>

117
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,102
<i>But I can't do it without Finn.</i>

118
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,420
<i>He's a shoo-in for prom king,</i>

119
00:05:14,421 --> 00:05:16,606
<i>and after winning the big game,</i>

120
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,424
<i>he'll help me land
crucial swing votes.</i>

121
00:05:18,425 --> 00:05:21,561
<i>Amazingly, the only person
standing in my way</i>

122
00:05:21,562 --> 00:05:24,263
<i>is her and her damn talent.</i>

123
00:05:24,264 --> 00:05:26,933
<i>If I'm going to guarantee
that he doesn't stray with her,</i>

124
00:05:26,934 --> 00:05:30,320
<i>I'm going to have
to play it right.</i>

125
00:05:30,321 --> 00:05:31,821
<i>They say,
"Keep your friends close,</i>

126
00:05:31,822 --> 00:05:34,324
<i>but your enemies closer."</i>

127
00:05:34,325 --> 00:05:36,159
<i>Well, Rachel Berry,</i>

128
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,662
<i>you just got yourself
a new best friend.</i>

129
00:05:50,841 --> 00:05:53,292
Pavarotti?

130
00:05:53,293 --> 00:05:55,395
Warblers! Warblers!
I am merely suggesting

131
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,981
that instead of wearing blue
ties with red piping,

132
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,233
we wear jackets with red ties

133
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,851
and blue piping
for the competition.

134
00:06:01,852 --> 00:06:04,020
This is a kangaroo court!

135
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,159
Kurt, what's wrong?

136
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,861
It's Pavarotti.

137
00:06:11,862 --> 00:06:14,497
Pavarotti is dead.

138
00:06:14,498 --> 00:06:16,315
I suspect a stroke.

139
00:06:16,316 --> 00:06:18,301
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

140
00:06:18,302 --> 00:06:21,955
I know it's really stupid to
be upset about a bird, but...

141
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:27,544
He... He inspired me
with his optimism,

142
00:06:27,545 --> 00:06:29,829
and his love of song.

143
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,632
He was my friend.

144
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:36,102
Now, I know today we need
to practice doo-wopping

145
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:38,354
behind Blaine while
he sings every solo

146
00:06:38,355 --> 00:06:40,023
in the medley of P!nk songs,

147
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:44,394
but I'd like to sing a
song for Pavarotti today.

by My Chemical Romance
for Regionals?

176
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:51,070
Well, I hold in my hand a cease
and desist letter from the band.

177
00:08:51,071 --> 00:08:52,105
We can't do it.

178
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:53,472
It was the perfect anthem.

179
00:08:53,473 --> 00:08:54,824
How much do you want to bet

180
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,059
Coach Sylvester has something
to do with this?

181
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,410
One step ahead of you.

182
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,911
Do you know
anything about this, Sue?

183
00:08:58,912 --> 00:09:01,364
I do. Now,
I met the drummer

184
00:09:01,365 --> 00:09:03,649
from My Chemical Romance at a
drum circle at Daytona Beach,

185
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,618
Spring Break, 1996.

186
00:09:05,619 --> 00:09:06,986
We had a brief affair.

187
00:09:06,987 --> 00:09:09,756
And when I heard of your
song choice for Regionals,

188
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,491
well, I was compelled
to notify the band

189
00:09:12,492 --> 00:09:15,327
about your long-running
legal battle with PETA.

190
00:09:15,328 --> 00:09:17,213
That is not true.

191
00:09:17,214 --> 00:09:19,182
You took away my Cheerios!

192
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:24,220
Consider this the opening
salvo of World War Sue.

193
00:09:24,221 --> 00:09:25,605
So what are we going to do now?

194
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,691
I think we should write
original songs for Regionals.

195
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:31,444
All those in favor of voting
Rachel down a second time?

196
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,962
No. I think
Rachel is right.

197
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:35,231
This team works best
when we push ourselves

198
00:09:35,232 --> 00:09:36,682
and do something
a little different.

199
00:09:36,683 --> 00:09:39,585
That's true, but if all the other teams
are doing amazing songs

200
00:09:39,586 --> 00:09:41,087
we're not going to be so good.

201
00:09:41,088 --> 00:09:42,622
You're right.
We're not going to be as good.

202
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,840
We're going to be better.

203
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:47,293
We won't be using
other people's words or music.

204
00:09:47,294 --> 00:09:48,711
It'll be our own.

205
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:50,747
Our own heart, soul,
not just our voices.

206
00:09:50,748 --> 00:09:53,032
We have a really
talented songwriter

207
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:55,551
in our midst. Rachel.

208
00:09:55,552 --> 00:09:57,920
I was thinking maybe you and I
could write a song together.

209
00:09:57,921 --> 00:09:59,538
I'm with Quinn and Rachel.

210
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:01,824
I mean, if these two
can agree on something,

211
00:10:01,825 --> 00:10:02,975
it's probably an idea
worth considering.

212
00:10:02,976 --> 00:10:04,310
Wait, wait, so suddenly,

213
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:06,429
you two are writing the music
for Regionals? No way.

214
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,147
I think that everyone should
get a chance to write a song.

215
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:09,565
Santana's right.
We can do this.

216
00:10:09,566 --> 00:10:11,317
What do you think,
Mr. Shue?

217
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:14,087
I think we're doing original
songs for Regionals.

218
00:10:20,802 --> 00:10:22,469
Hey.

219
00:10:24,472 --> 00:10:26,691
Can I ask you a question?

220
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,976
We used to be really close,
and I really miss being your friend.

221
00:10:28,977 --> 00:10:30,194
Still waiting for the question.

222
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:32,446
- Did I do something wrong?
- No. Look, I don't know.

223
00:10:32,447 --> 00:10:33,915
Did you?

224
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,816
All I know is you blew me off

225
00:10:35,817 --> 00:10:38,152
to be with
Stumbles McCripplepants.

226
00:10:38,153 --> 00:10:39,320
That's fine.

227
00:10:39,321 --> 00:10:40,872
It's your loss.

228
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:42,423
'Cause now I get
the chance to write

229
00:10:42,424 --> 00:10:44,876
an awesome heterosexual
song about Sam

230
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,511
that we're going
to sing at Regionals.

231
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:47,845
Wait, you're still dating Sam?

232
00:10:47,846 --> 00:10:50,164
But you told me you
were in love with me.

233
00:10:50,165 --> 00:10:52,216
I honestly don't know
what I was thinking.

234
00:10:53,335 --> 00:10:54,552
Look, can you stop
staring at me?

235
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:55,836
I can't remember
my locker combo.

236
00:10:55,837 --> 00:10:57,805
Well, well.

237
00:10:57,806 --> 00:11:00,892
If it isn't Tweedle-Dumb
and Tweedle-Fake-Boobs.

238
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,676
You know, you can't
talk to us like that.

239
00:11:02,677 --> 00:11:04,228
You're not our cheer
coach anymore.

240
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:07,231
I'm not anybody's
cheer-leading coach anymore.

241
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:09,683
You betrayed me,
and in case you haven't heard,

242
00:11:09,684 --> 00:11:11,035
I like to play dirty.

243
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,627
I don't even remember
putting that in there.

244
00:11:21,046 --> 00:11:23,364
You know,
I think Blaine's version

245
00:11:23,365 --> 00:11:25,132
of the song is actually
better than the original.

246
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:26,751
But it's not
in his natural key, so...

247
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:29,470
- How dare you.
- Enough. I'm tired of this.

248
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:30,755
I agree.
I think we should just

249
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,206
let you pick the song
that you want to sing.

250
00:11:32,207 --> 00:11:35,526
No, I'm tired of the Warblers
being all about me.

251
00:11:35,527 --> 00:11:36,894
David, please make
sure everything

252
00:11:36,895 --> 00:11:38,596
I'm about to say goes down
in the official minutes.

253
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,882
We are going to lose
at Regionals.

254
00:11:41,883 --> 00:11:44,268
- What?!
- I am incredibly grateful

255
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:46,537
for the belief you've all given me,
as a junior member,

256
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:48,055
to lead you all in these
wonderful songs this year.

257
00:11:48,056 --> 00:11:51,025
But, from what Kurt has told me
about New Directions,

258
00:11:51,026 --> 00:11:53,778
I just know I can't
beat them on my own.

259
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,414
Which is why I propose
that we rearrange

260
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:59,233
our 11:00 number
and turn it into a duet.

261
00:12:00,535 --> 00:12:02,236
To showcase other
talent in this group.

262
00:12:02,237 --> 00:12:03,170
Why don't we just
play it on kazoos?

263
00:12:03,171 --> 00:12:04,338
Point of order! Point of order!

264
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:06,841
Now, we all lost one
of our own this week.

265
00:12:06,842 --> 00:12:08,342
Pavarotti's voice was
silenced by death,

266
00:12:08,343 --> 00:12:12,463
and I don't want to silence
anyone else's voices in this group.

267
00:12:12,464 --> 00:12:14,465
I think Pavarotti
would roll over

268
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:15,600
in his tiny, tiny,
little grave.

269
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,802
The placement of which
has yet to be determined.

270
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,253
All right, a vote.

271
00:12:19,254 --> 00:12:21,772
Who's in favor
of Warbler Blaine's proposal

272
00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:23,924
for a dual lead at Regionals?

273
00:12:27,195 --> 00:12:28,863
Oh, can I put my name
on the audition list?

274
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:30,264
No.

275
00:12:30,265 --> 00:12:31,432
No auditions.

276
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:34,935
I want
to sing the duet with Kurt.

277
00:12:34,936 --> 00:12:37,538
That's ridiculous.

278
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:39,323
I mean, there are
so many great voices.

279
00:12:39,324 --> 00:12:41,075
I mean, everyone deserves
a shot at that honor.

280
00:12:41,076 --> 00:12:43,744
All in favor of Kurt being my
duet partner at Regionals?

281
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:48,582
Decided.

282
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:49,834
Congratulations, Kurt.

283
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,618
Congratulations.

284
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,724
All right, guys, let's hear it for
our first songwriting seminar.

285
00:12:59,294 --> 00:13:00,794
While Quinn and Rachel
are hard at work,

286
00:13:00,795 --> 00:13:02,513
we're gonna try to write
an anthem of our own.

287
00:13:02,514 --> 00:13:05,299
Now, these are rhyming
dictionaries for all of you.

288
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,767
Mr. Shue?

289
00:13:06,768 --> 00:13:09,236
Tina and I have been already
working on a song that I wrote.

290
00:13:09,237 --> 00:13:10,971
Really?
That's amazing.

291
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:12,657
Well, can we hear it?

292
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:18,829
This is a song
that I wrote for Sam.

293
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:19,997
It's called,
"Trouty Mouth."

294
00:13:19,998 --> 00:13:23,284
- Wait, what's it called?
- "Trouty Mouth."

- Stop with the mouth jokes.
- Sit down. I'm not finished.

308
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,653
Yes, you are. Mr. Shue,
we're not doing a song at Regionals

309
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:34,388
- called "Trouty Mouth."
- You know what?

310
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:35,722
I have to agree
with Sam on this one.

311
00:14:35,723 --> 00:14:37,408
But such a good first effort.

312
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,725
I just don't think
it's got the, um,

313
00:14:38,726 --> 00:14:40,745
epic feel we need
for Regionals.

314
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,079
Mr. Shue?
I wrote a song, too.

315
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,564
I wrote it for Lauren.

316
00:14:43,565 --> 00:14:46,250
I know that when I sang
"Fat-Bottomed Girls,"

317
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:47,618
it might have hurt
her feelings a little bit,

318
00:14:47,619 --> 00:14:50,621
but I think this
makes up for it.

319
00:14:50,622 --> 00:14:52,072
It's got a bit of
a rockabilly feel,

320
00:14:52,073 --> 00:14:54,091
so it could give us
an edge this weekend.

321
00:14:54,092 --> 00:14:56,127
All right. Show
us what you got.

322
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:00,297

All right, guys, well,

351
00:16:17,425 --> 00:16:18,959
let's, uh, let's make Puck's
song a contender,

352
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,327
but I don't totally
think we're there yet.

353
00:16:20,328 --> 00:16:22,680
So, everyone, look at your
rhyming dictionaries,

354
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,715
and let's work on banging out
some songs that rock.

355
00:16:26,935 --> 00:16:28,435
What do you want
to wear to prom?

356
00:16:28,436 --> 00:16:29,836
Prom? What?

357
00:16:29,837 --> 00:16:31,004
Look, I know you're
excited about Regionals.

358
00:16:31,005 --> 00:16:32,439
So am I.
Wasn't I the one

359
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,726
that supported Rachel's
crazy original song idea?

360
00:16:35,727 --> 00:16:37,695
Yeah. That was cool, by the way.

361
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,480
But whether we win
that or even Nationals,

362
00:16:39,481 --> 00:16:41,615
it's not going to put you
and I back where we belong.

363
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:43,450
- Which is where?
- On top.

364
00:16:43,451 --> 00:16:45,352
- On top of what?
- We need to get elected

365
00:16:45,353 --> 00:16:46,620
for prom king and queen.

366
00:16:46,621 --> 00:16:48,689
It's the ultimate status symbol.

367
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,708
So after Regionals,
we'll go public

368
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,794
with our relationship,
and start the campaign.

369
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:56,714
I don't think
that's a good idea.

370
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,832
Why?

371
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,751
Because of Rachel?

372
00:17:00,752 --> 00:17:02,336
She's really fragile right now.

373
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:03,587
I just think we should wait
until after Nationals.

374
00:17:03,588 --> 00:17:05,673
Okay, first,
it was after Regionals.

375
00:17:05,674 --> 00:17:07,174
Now it's after Nationals?

376
00:17:07,175 --> 00:17:08,475
Do you want to be
in this relationship or not?

377
00:17:08,476 --> 00:17:11,762
Whoa. Scary Quinn.
Okay. Uh...

378
00:17:11,763 --> 00:17:14,765
- After Regionals.
- After Regionals.

379
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,511
What's that?

380
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:37,463
I'm decorating
Pavarotti's casket.

381
00:17:37,464 --> 00:17:38,932
Well, finish up.

382
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,967
I have the perfect song for our number,
and we should practice.

383
00:17:40,968 --> 00:17:42,018
Do tell.

384
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:45,155
"Candles" by Hey Monday.

385
00:17:45,156 --> 00:17:46,823
I'm impressed.

386
00:17:46,824 --> 00:17:48,441
You're usually so Top 40.

387
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:52,746
Well, I just wanted something
a little more emotional.

388
00:17:57,168 --> 00:18:00,453
Why did you pick me
to sing that song with?

389
00:18:04,642 --> 00:18:06,492
Kurt, there is a moment...

390
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,996
When you say to yourself,

391
00:18:09,997 --> 00:18:12,132
"Oh, there you are.

392
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:15,185
I've been looking
for you forever."

393
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:23,143
Watching you do
"Blackbird" this week...

394
00:18:25,196 --> 00:18:27,764
That was a moment for me.

395
00:18:27,765 --> 00:18:29,733
About you.

396
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,989
You move me, Kurt.

397
00:18:37,975 --> 00:18:40,043
And this duet
would just be an excuse

398
00:18:40,044 --> 00:18:42,328
to spend more time with you.

399
00:19:05,236 --> 00:19:08,188
Um, we should...
We should practice.

400
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,190

Really, really good.

440
00:21:08,025 --> 00:21:09,025
- Thank you.
- But, um...

441
00:21:09,026 --> 00:21:10,343
"But," my butt, Mr. Shue.

442
00:21:10,344 --> 00:21:12,645
- That song was amazing.
- No, I agree.

443
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,197
I'm just not sure that
it's Regionals material.

444
00:21:14,198 --> 00:21:16,149
Mr. Shue,

445
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,450
I wrote another verse
of "Trouty Mouth."

446
00:21:17,451 --> 00:21:19,319
No, no, no.
Guys, guys.

447
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,620
Just... Just think about it.

448
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:22,021
What's your favorite
song of all time?

449
00:21:22,022 --> 00:21:23,907
- "My Headband."
- Alanis Morissette's

450
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,524
- "You Oughta Know."
- "What's Going On," Marvin Gaye.

451
00:21:25,525 --> 00:21:27,293
Puckerman, you're on a roll.

452
00:21:27,294 --> 00:21:28,694
Okay, and what are
all those songs about?

453
00:21:28,695 --> 00:21:29,712
Headbands.

454
00:21:29,713 --> 00:21:32,999
All these songs
come from a place of pain.

455
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,368
The greatest songs
are about hurt,

456
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:37,053
and that's the
side of yourselves

457
00:21:37,054 --> 00:21:38,371
I want you to get
in touch with.

458
00:21:38,372 --> 00:21:39,639
That should be easy.

459
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,057
Coach Sylvester
tortures us for no reason

460
00:21:41,058 --> 00:21:43,209
and tries to get the entire
school to hate us.

461
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,845
Yesterday, she filled Britt's
and my locker with dirt.

462
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,564
Okay. Okay, slow down.
Slow down.

463
00:21:48,565 --> 00:21:49,766
She literally
throws sticks at me.

464
00:21:51,902 --> 00:21:55,054
- What are you doing?
- Throwing sticks at your head.

465
00:21:55,055 --> 00:21:57,073
I'm going to crush
you at Regionals.

466
00:21:57,074 --> 00:21:58,391
Okay, what else? What else?

467
00:21:58,392 --> 00:22:00,076
She called
the Ohio Secretary of State,

468
00:22:00,077 --> 00:22:01,494
saying she was me
and that I want

469
00:22:01,495 --> 00:22:02,895
to legally change my name
to "Tina Cohen-Loser."

470
00:22:02,896 --> 00:22:04,397
She...

471
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:10,637
Okay, and how does
that make you feel?

472
00:22:10,638 --> 00:22:14,324
Well, at first it hurts, but...

473
00:22:14,325 --> 00:22:16,742
Then it mostly makes
you want to win.

474
00:22:16,743 --> 00:22:18,011
Guys...

475
00:22:18,012 --> 00:22:20,013
I think you may have
just found your song.

476
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,020
Now let's get to writing.

477
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:33,259
- You're late.
- We're friends, right?

478
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,894
- Yeah, I guess so.
- I mean, like

479
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,063
everything happened last year.

480
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,481
You gave your baby to my mom.

481
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,999
We kind of bonded
over it, right?

482
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,900
What's your point?

483
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,569
My point is... Is that
I know we haven't spent

484
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,821
a lot of time
together this year,

485
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:47,440
but I thought that
we were close enough

486
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:48,825
to be honest with each other.

487
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:52,328
- Go ahead, ask me.
- Fine.

488
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,663
Are you and Finn together?

489
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,598
Yes.

490
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:57,300
It's been a couple of weeks.

491
00:22:57,301 --> 00:22:59,419
It's like Groundhog's Day
with you, Rachel.

492
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,671
How many times do you have
to make the same mistake

493
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,056
to realize it's not going
to work out?

494
00:23:04,624 --> 00:23:06,625
Thank you for being
honest with me, Quinn,

495
00:23:06,626 --> 00:23:08,344
and... And I'm happy
for you and Finn,

496
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,446
but don't go and try
to rewrite history, okay?

497
00:23:10,447 --> 00:23:13,266
It was real between us.
He chose me over you.

498
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:15,018
And how long did that last for?

499
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,022
Why are you being so mean?

500
00:23:24,628 --> 00:23:26,996
Do you want to know
how this story plays out?

501
00:23:28,482 --> 00:23:31,484
I get Finn, you get heartbroken,

502
00:23:31,485 --> 00:23:35,254
and then Finn and I stay here
and start a family.

503
00:23:35,255 --> 00:23:39,926
I'll become a successful
real estate agent,

504
00:23:39,927 --> 00:23:43,596
and Finn will take over
Kurt's dad's tire shop.

505
00:23:43,597 --> 00:23:45,998
You don't belong here, Rachel,

506
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:47,767
and you can't hate me
for helping

507
00:23:47,768 --> 00:23:49,435
to send you on your way.

508
00:23:49,436 --> 00:23:51,471
No.

509
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,556
I'm not giving up on Finn.

510
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,774
It's not over between us.

511
00:23:54,775 --> 00:23:55,942
Yes, it is!

512
00:23:55,943 --> 00:23:58,010
You're so frustrating,

513
00:23:58,011 --> 00:24:00,346
and that is why you can't
write a good song...

514
00:24:00,347 --> 00:24:03,516
Because you live in this
little schoolgirl fantasy of life.

515
00:24:03,517 --> 00:24:06,285
Rachel, if you keep looking
for that happy ending,

516
00:24:06,286 --> 00:24:08,187
then you are never going
to get it right.

517
00:24:08,188 --> 00:24:09,655
So we're done with that,

518
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,324
and why don't we just
return to our work, okay?

519
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:20,249
No, I think I'm gonna write
this song on my own.

520
00:24:39,685 --> 00:24:41,269
Hey, buddy, you getting
ready to load up the bus

521
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,304
and head off to Regionals?

522
00:24:43,305 --> 00:24:44,972
- Awesome.
- You seem awfully chipper.

523
00:24:44,973 --> 00:24:46,224
Oh, I am, William,

524
00:24:46,225 --> 00:24:48,609
I am positively drunk
with confidence.

525
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:51,946
In fact, I am so sure
of my Glee Club's impending win,

526
00:24:51,947 --> 00:24:53,648
I'm gonna drop
a little turdlet on you.

527
00:24:53,649 --> 00:24:55,483
I lied to you last week, William.

528
00:24:55,484 --> 00:24:58,619
I forged that letter
from My Chemical Romance.

529
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,371
Also, I didn't sleep
with their drummer.

530
00:25:00,372 --> 00:25:01,405
The drummer I slept with

531
00:25:01,406 --> 00:25:03,040
was that guy
from Jimmy Eat World.

532
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:05,576
Actually, Sue,
I'm glad you lied.

533
00:25:05,577 --> 00:25:07,495
Gave my kids the
opportunity to try

534
00:25:07,496 --> 00:25:09,714
- their hand at songwriting.
- Oh, so you're trying to lose.

535
00:25:09,715 --> 00:25:12,967
You have an awful lot
of confidence for a rookie, Sue.

536
00:25:12,968 --> 00:25:16,053
William, while your kids
are singing songs about

537
00:25:16,054 --> 00:25:18,222
blackheads and eczema,

538
00:25:18,223 --> 00:25:19,991

742
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:58,319
Before we start, I would like
to say I am not a witch.

743
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,305
But, um,
I think it's fair to ask.

744
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:03,408
Do we have written proof
that these kids were born

745
00:39:03,409 --> 00:39:04,659
in the United States of America?

746
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,061
For a nun, I'm pretty liberal.

747
00:39:09,081 --> 00:39:10,815
But I'm barely a nun.

748
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:13,484
In fact, I just joined because
I needed a place to live.

749
00:39:13,485 --> 00:39:15,003
Bless you!

750
00:39:15,004 --> 00:39:17,822
The convent is the one place I
knew I could stay off the pole.

751
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:20,157
But my question is this.

752
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:22,159
That Dalton Academy...
Is it a gay school,

753
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,379
or is it just a school
that appears gay?

754
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:28,216
Could I add a dash of Rod
to this lady soup?

755
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:31,970
My hairdresser is a gay,

756
00:39:31,971 --> 00:39:34,806
and for fifteen years,
he's been with his partner,

757
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:36,841
also a hairdresser.

758
00:39:36,842 --> 00:39:39,360
I see no reason why they
shouldn't be allowed to marry

759
00:39:39,361 --> 00:39:41,012
and raise a family
of beautiful wigs.

760
00:39:41,013 --> 00:39:43,448
I liked the duet
the two boys from Dalton sang.

761
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:44,649
Oh, boys shouldn't do a duet.

762
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,851
The last thing we need
to do is send a message

763
00:39:46,852 --> 00:39:49,821
to children that "gay is okay."

764
00:39:49,822 --> 00:39:51,990
It is not
a legitimate lifestyle,

765
00:39:51,991 --> 00:39:54,292
and last time I checked,
it's not in the Constitution.

766
00:39:54,293 --> 00:39:57,028
- What about that song about Jesus?
- Well, that should win.

767
00:39:57,029 --> 00:39:58,863
Uh, uh, uh. No, no, no, no.

768
00:39:58,864 --> 00:40:00,665
Now, that is just
cheap pandering.

769
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:03,334
I didn't even like to be pandered to
when I was a stripper!

770
00:40:03,335 --> 00:40:05,386
Those New Directions
had it going on.

771
00:40:05,387 --> 00:40:08,056
- Those songs were fresh.
- Those songs were terrible.

772
00:40:08,057 --> 00:40:09,891
I am sorry,
but I'm a politician,

773
00:40:09,892 --> 00:40:11,659
and when I lost
my last election...

774
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,878
and there will be a recount...
I didn't go around singing

775
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:15,596
about being a loser.

776
00:40:15,597 --> 00:40:17,765
I Twittered
that Obama is a terrorist.

777
00:40:17,766 --> 00:40:20,101
- Oh, no, you didn't!
- I had to. It's a fact.

778
00:40:20,102 --> 00:40:22,937
- Oh, oh, gee.
- Okay, ladies, I've heard enough.

779
00:40:22,938 --> 00:40:24,772
Let's... vote.

780
00:40:24,773 --> 00:40:27,442
<i>And now, to announce our winner,</i>

781
00:40:27,443 --> 00:40:30,611
<i>Lieutenant Governor Stevens' wife,
Carla Turlington-Stevens!</i>

782
00:40:37,252 --> 00:40:40,738
My husband is verbally abusive,

783
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:43,341
and I have been
drinking since noon.

784
00:40:50,716 --> 00:40:53,101
I'm bored.
Let's just see who won, huh?

785
00:40:59,274 --> 00:41:01,526
The New Directions!

786
00:41:01,527 --> 00:41:03,728
You're going to Nationals
in New York!

787
00:41:42,401 --> 00:41:44,402
Farewell, sweet prince.

788
00:41:45,571 --> 00:41:47,572
I'm so sorry, Kurt.

789
00:41:47,573 --> 00:41:50,108
I know this is really
upsetting for you.

790
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:53,828
It reminds you of your
mom's funeral, doesn't it?

791
00:41:56,148 --> 00:41:57,698
The casket was bigger,

792
00:41:57,699 --> 00:42:00,535
but yes.

793
00:42:00,536 --> 00:42:03,004
It's not just that, though.

794
00:42:03,005 --> 00:42:05,456
Honestly, I'm upset that
we lost at Regionals.

795
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:08,176
Well, the competition
season's over,

796
00:42:08,177 --> 00:42:10,178
but we'll still get to perform.

797
00:42:10,179 --> 00:42:12,496
We do nursing home shows
all the time.

798
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:15,466
And do you know how many Gaps
there are in Ohio?

799
00:42:15,467 --> 00:42:17,535
Tons.

800
00:42:17,536 --> 00:42:20,888
Yeah, I just really...
really wanted to win.

801
00:42:20,889 --> 00:42:23,474
You did win.

802
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,028
So did I.

803
00:42:27,029 --> 00:42:30,198
We got each other
out of all this.

804
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:32,116
That beats a lousy trophy,
don't you think?

805
00:42:38,874 --> 00:42:40,842
I'll show you the video
when you get home.

806
00:42:40,843 --> 00:42:42,860
Have fun in the sweat lodge.

807
00:42:44,546 --> 00:42:45,863
<i>Namaste</i> to you, too.

808
00:42:45,864 --> 00:42:47,131
Okay. Bye.

809
00:42:47,132 --> 00:42:49,417
Ms. Holliday sends her best,
and can't wait

810
00:42:49,418 --> 00:42:50,868
to congratulate you
all in person

811
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:52,303
when she gets back
from her meditation retreat.

812
00:42:52,304 --> 00:42:55,006
Now, we all know
that winning Regionals

813
00:42:55,007 --> 00:42:57,341
was a team effort, and Nationals
isn't going to be any different.

814
00:42:57,342 --> 00:42:58,926
But like in sports,

815
00:42:58,927 --> 00:43:01,229
every winning team has a player
that rises above

816
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:03,564
to help carry their teammates
to victory... The MVP.

817
00:43:03,565 --> 00:43:07,218
And I would like to start a tradition
of honoring that player

818
00:43:07,219 --> 00:43:08,886
after every one
of our competitions.

819
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:10,571
So, per a unanimous vote

820
00:43:10,572 --> 00:43:14,742
by all of you,
our Regionals MVP is...

821
00:43:16,061 --> 00:43:17,111
Miss Rachel Berry!

822
00:43:18,396 --> 00:43:19,914
Come on up.

823
00:43:19,915 --> 00:43:21,282
Yeah!

824
00:43:21,283 --> 00:43:22,783
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

825
00:43:22,784 --> 00:43:25,586
- If I could just say a few words?
- Sure.

826
00:43:25,587 --> 00:43:28,289
And here she goes,
making me regret voting for her.

827
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:30,675
Well, first of all,
I just want to say

828
00:43:30,676 --> 00:43:32,593
how amazing
the song you guys wrote was.

829
00:43:32,594 --> 00:43:33,878
I... I was so inspired.

830
00:43:33,879 --> 00:43:36,597
You know, it's...
It's funny.

831
00:43:36,598 --> 00:43:39,133
I've won a lot of trophies
before for singing competitions

832
00:43:39,134 --> 00:43:40,301
and dancing competitions,

833
00:43:40,302 --> 00:43:42,586
but I've always felt
like the girl

834
00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:44,272
who never gets the brass ring.

835
00:43:46,141 --> 00:43:48,425
And maybe I never will.

836
00:43:48,426 --> 00:43:52,813
But today and at Regionals,

837
00:43:52,814 --> 00:43:55,399
the way you guys believed in me

838
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,452
and... took a chance with me...

839
00:43:58,453 --> 00:44:02,073
All I've ever wanted was
to feel special

840
00:44:02,074 --> 00:44:05,776
and to feel chosen,
and I just, um...

841
00:44:05,777 --> 00:44:08,629
I wanted to thank you guys
so much for giving me that.

842
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:11,115
So... That's all.

843
00:44:11,116 --> 00:44:12,750
MVP!

844
00:44:12,751 --> 00:44:19,223
