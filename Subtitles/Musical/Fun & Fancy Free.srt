- Can I try ?
-[ Bergen ] Certainly.

Yes. I think I can
see it, Mr. Bergen.

518
00:42:38,701 --> 00:42:40,965
It's beautiful.

519
00:42:41,037 --> 00:42:44,006
[ Bergen ] Yes, it was one of
nature's garden spots,

00:42:44,073 --> 00:42:47,201
nestled among the green,
rolling hills.

521
00:42:47,276 --> 00:42:50,109
Can't you see the lovely brook
as it flows through the valley?

522

[ Mortimer ] Mmm. Yeah,yeah,yeah.

523

-[ Mortimer ] My red barn.

529
00:43:09,432 --> 00:43:11,900
[ Bergen ] No, no.
It was something much nicer.

530
00:43:11,968 --> 00:43:15,335
- It was a majestic castle!
-[ Luana ] Oh, that's pretty.

531
00:43:15,671 --> 00:43:18,731

is kept within these castle walls.

533

[ All Laughing ]

560
00:44:36,919 --> 00:44:39,114
[ Bergen ] Yes, the voice
of this golden harp...

561
00:44:39,188 --> 00:44:42,453
cast a magic spell ofjoy
and prosperity over the valley.

562
00:44:42,525 --> 00:44:46,052
- But it was too good to last...
-[ Charlie ] I knew
there was a catch in it.

563
00:44:46,128 --> 00:44:48,323
- for one day--
-[ Charlie ] They built a schoolhouse.

564
00:44:48,397 --> 00:44:52,483
[ Bergen ] No, no. One day a
mysterious shadow crept over the valley.

565
00:44:53,684 --> 00:44:56,084
And then something dreadful
happened!

566
00:44:56,153 --> 00:44:59,088
[ Thunder Rolling, Lightning Crashing ]

567
00:45:00,825 --> 00:45:03,487
Aaaaaah !

568
00:45:03,561 --> 00:45:05,529
[ Luana ] What happened?

569
00:45:05,596 --> 00:45:09,464
[ Bergen ] When the shadow lifted,
the golden harp was gone.

570
00:45:09,533 --> 00:45:13,333
No longer was the valley happy,
for without the magic of the harp,

571
00:45:13,404 --> 00:45:17,670
all was misery,
misery, misery.

572
00:45:17,742 --> 00:45:19,903
[ Charlie ] Just like the eighth grade.

573
00:45:19,977 --> 00:45:21,945
[ Bergen ] Desolation
spread over the land.

574
00:45:22,012 --> 00:45:24,207
Everything was drying up.

-[ Mortimer ] Dry rot.
-[ Charlie ] Yes, isn't it ?

-[ Bergen ] Charlie.
-[ Charlie ] Yes, sir.

577
00:45:28,686 --> 00:45:32,178
[ Bergen ] The fields of golden corn
turned to dust.

[ Charlie ] Kerplop.

00:45:34,258 --> 00:45:37,250
[ Bergen ] The laughing brook
flowed no more.

580
00:45:40,998 --> 00:45:44,559
To think that this
was once Happy Valley!

581
00:45:44,635 --> 00:45:46,569
[ Charlie ] Now it's Gruesome Gulch.

582
00:45:46,637 --> 00:45:49,606
[ Bergen ] Days pass, weeks pass.

583
00:45:49,673 --> 00:45:52,369
[ Charlie ] I pass. New deal.

584
00:45:52,443 --> 00:45:55,173
[ Luana ] What happened
to all the people ?

585
00:45:55,246 --> 00:45:57,646
[ Bergen ] Well, suppose we look in
on these humble peasants.

586
00:45:57,715 --> 00:46:00,980
-[ Mortimer ] Is that a peasant ?
-[ Charlie ] That's a cow, stupid.

587
00:46:01,051 --> 00:46:03,178
[ Luana ] Well, at least they had milk.

588
00:46:03,254 --> 00:46:05,779
[ Bergen ] Well, she used to be
a good milker. But now--

589
00:46:05,856 --> 00:46:08,689
[ Charlie ] She's an udder failure.

590
00:46:08,759 --> 00:46:12,320
[ Bergen ] She was the bosom friend
of a once-proud family.

out of the high rent district.

by the pangs of starvation.

between them.

Share and share alike.

00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:37,016
Sharing and staring.
Staring and sharing.

[ Charlie ] Uh,just tell it,
don't ham it.

600
00:46:39,423 --> 00:46:41,721
[ Bergen ] But are
their spirits broken ?

601
00:46:41,792 --> 00:46:43,783
Have they lost hope ?

602
00:46:43,861 --> 00:46:48,696
Yes. Men facing famine,
naught left but beans.

603
00:46:48,766 --> 00:46:51,963
[ Charlie ] Ahem. Bean,you mean.

604
00:46:52,036 --> 00:46:54,732
[ Bergen ] If it were one man
and three beans--

But, no. One bean
and three men.

[ Charlie ] Well, at least
there are no bones in it.

607
00:47:02,112 --> 00:47:04,478

miserable creature,

doggedly struggling
to maintain life,

00:47:07,318 --> 00:47:10,947
a gaunt, lean bag
of bones and feathers.

00:47:11,021 --> 00:47:14,286

is being hatched in the fevered brain...

Well, back to the scene

Things are beginning
to look much brighter now,

because as Mickey goes
to the village to sell the cow,
the thought of prosperity...

to the famished farmers.

- What d'you mean, beans ?

677
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,964
Yeah, fellows. I sold the cow
for some magic beans !

These are not ordinary beans!
They're magic beans!

If you plant these beans
in the light of a full moon,
do you know what'll happen ?

Yes ! We get more beans !

- No, no, Donald !
- [ Donald ] Magic beans! Phooey!

[ Bergen ] Poor Mickey,

cheated into trading his cow
for a handful of beans.

686
00:51:13,897 --> 00:51:16,627
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
What a mean trick!

687
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:20,033
Swindling an innocent farmer
out of all he owned...

688
00:51:20,104 --> 00:51:23,870
and lying to him, telling him
that the beans were magic.

Planted in the light
of a full moon!

690
00:51:27,945 --> 00:51:31,472
What a shame to deceive
a simple little peasant.

691
00:51:31,548 --> 00:51:33,982
Magic beans, indeed!

-[ Bergen ] What ?
-[ Luana ] There's something moving.

694
00:51:39,256 --> 00:51:43,386
[ Bergen ] Why,yes. Well, maybe
there is some magic in them !

695
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:46,520
All right, now let's all keep quiet
and see what happens.

00:52:24,876 --> 00:52:26,810
Mmm.

[ Giggles ]

700
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:03,406
[ Bergen ] And all
through the night, it grew,

701
00:54:03,475 --> 00:54:05,568
onward and upward.

702
00:54:05,644 --> 00:54:08,442
[ Charlie ] That thing
is a menace to aviation.

703
00:54:10,749 --> 00:54:12,683
[ Bergen ] And so,
with the coming of dawn,

704
00:54:12,751 --> 00:54:16,118
we find the bewildered farmers
staring at a mammoth castle,

705
00:54:16,188 --> 00:54:18,122
miles above the earth.

706
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:21,819
Their curiosity was aroused,:
nothing could hold them back.

707
00:54:21,893 --> 00:54:24,953
Who lives there ?
Man or monster?

708
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:27,965
Friend or foe ?
Aprincess or a dragon ?

709
00:54:28,033 --> 00:54:29,967
[ Mortimer ] Well, search me.

710
00:54:30,035 --> 00:54:33,095
[ Bergen ] What drew them toward
this place of mystery?

711
00:54:33,171 --> 00:54:35,298
Hunger? Desperation ?

712
00:54:35,374 --> 00:54:37,842
Or perhaps it was
love of adventure.

713
00:54:37,909 --> 00:54:41,208
What a fantastic experience,:
perhaps mortal man...

714
00:54:41,279 --> 00:54:44,510
has never before set foot
on this strange land.

715
00:54:44,583 --> 00:54:48,781
-[ Charlie ] Well, somebody did.
-[ Mortimer ] Oh, gosh!
Who made them ?

716
00:54:48,854 --> 00:54:51,880
[ Charlie ] Well, it wasn't Cinderella.

717
00:54:51,957 --> 00:54:55,723
[ Bergen ] Soon they reached
the moat surrounding the castle.

718
00:54:55,794 --> 00:55:00,731
But this didn't stop them. On they went,
as if drawn by some irresistible force.

719
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:04,326
And then, suddenly, without warning,
out of the sky above--

720
00:55:04,403 --> 00:55:06,462
- [ Dragonflies Droning ]
-[ Luana ] Ooh, dragonflies!

721
00:55:06,538 --> 00:55:10,736
[ Charlie ] Yeah. A-flyin'front
and draggin'behind.

[ All Screaming ]

727
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:07,698
[ Bergen ] Finally,
they reached the castle.

728
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,034
[ Charlie ] The hard way.

729
00:56:14,773 --> 00:56:17,207
[ Bergen ] This was the biggest
adventure of their lives.

730
00:56:17,275 --> 00:56:21,075
Forgotten was their hunger,:
forgotten was their fear.

731
00:56:21,146 --> 00:56:24,172
It took courage to scale
these massive steps,

732
00:56:24,249 --> 00:56:27,082
to make this journey
into the unknown.

733
00:56:27,152 --> 00:56:30,246
But these stouthearted lads
never faltered.

734
00:56:30,322 --> 00:56:32,722
Three minds with
but a single thought.:

735
00:56:32,791 --> 00:56:36,454
What mystery lurked within those
cold, forbidding walls ?

736
00:56:36,528 --> 00:56:39,964
What strange spell hovered
over this gloomy place ?

737
00:56:42,934 --> 00:56:44,868
Will no one answer?

738
00:56:44,936 --> 00:56:48,064
Are they walking into a trap ?
Do they go in ?

739
00:56:48,139 --> 00:56:51,370
[ Charlie ] You know,you could
stand some rehearsal on this story.

740
00:56:51,443 --> 00:56:55,072
[ Bergen ] Inside, the tremendous hall
was as silent as a tomb.

741
00:56:55,146 --> 00:56:57,944
Not a sign of life
anywhere.

742
00:56:58,016 --> 00:56:59,950
[ Charlie ] Caught with his pants--

743
00:57:00,018 --> 00:57:01,952
-[ Bergen ] Charlie!
-[ Charlie ] Caught with his pants--

00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:04,750
-[ Bergen ] Charlie!
-[ Charlie ]
Well, his slip was showing.

745
00:57:04,823 --> 00:57:06,757
[ Bergen ] They gazed
in speechless wonder,

746
00:57:06,825 --> 00:57:08,759
almost afraid to breathe.

747
00:57:08,827 --> 00:57:11,295
Suddenly they looked up.
What was it ?

748
00:57:11,363 --> 00:57:14,264
[ Donald ] Food!

himself into anything, man or beast.

for a drink.

[ Hiccups ]

759
00:59:02,707 --> 00:59:06,473
It was this heartless monster that
swooped down under cover of darkness,

- carried off the golden harp and
brought ruin to Happy Valley.

- You are not.

- Well... uh, 20 men.

- No.
- No ? Ten men ?

768
00:59:33,471 --> 00:59:36,440
Aren't you ashamed of yourself,
Charlie ? Why do you act like that ?

769
00:59:36,508 --> 00:59:40,171
I don't know. I guess it's just
a stage I'm goin' through.

- Well, take off that moustache.
- Yeow !

Now go over there
and behave yourself.

Yes, sir.
Everything I do is wrong.

773
00:59:46,451 --> 00:59:49,352
But why did the giant
want to steal the harp ?

774
00:59:49,421 --> 00:59:52,982
Because he was cruel and selfish. He
didn't care what happened to the valley.

775
00:59:53,058 --> 00:59:54,992
He just wanted someone
to sing him to sleep.

00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:57,460
Well, why didn't he
turn on the radio ?

777

Well, they didn't have
radios in those days.

00:59:59,564 --> 01:00:03,000
Yeah. That's why they called it
Happy Valley. [ Laughs ]
