not mean it just a teensy-weensy bit.

DANCERS [SINGING]:
When I hear that happy beat

1216
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:59,223
Feel like dancin' down the street

1217
01:23:09,026 --> 01:23:11,736

1225
01:28:48,949 --> 01:28:51,575
That's the idea.
What do you think of it?

1226
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:54,745
I can't visualize it.
I'll have to see it on film first.

1227
01:28:54,913 --> 01:28:57,414
- On film, it'll be better yet.
- Don't forget.

1228
01:28:57,666 --> 01:29:00,167
Have Selden re-record
all of Lina's dialogue.

1229
01:29:00,377 --> 01:29:02,253
- It's all set up.
- And remember...

1230
01:29:02,546 --> 01:29:05,047
...don't let Lina know about it.

1231
01:29:07,634 --> 01:29:09,051
COSMO:
All set in there?

1232
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:11,262
Right.

1233
01:29:11,888 --> 01:29:14,306
Nothing can keep us apart.

1234
01:29:14,558 --> 01:29:18,561
Our love will last
till the stars turn cold.

COSMO:
All right, Kathy. Go ahead.

KATHY:
Nothing can keep us apart.

1237
01:29:24,484 --> 01:29:28,320

That's great! Perfect. Cut.

1239

Till the stars turn cold.

1240
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:38,747
Oh, Kathy, I love you.

1241
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:43,127
I can't wait till
this picture's finished.

1242
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:46,797
No more secrecy.
I'm gonna let Lina and everyone know.

1243
01:29:47,007 --> 01:29:49,592
Your fans will be
bitterly disappointed.

1244
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:53,512
From now on, there's only
one fan I'm worried about.

1245
01:29:56,933 --> 01:29:57,975
ZELDA:
There!

1246
01:29:58,143 --> 01:30:01,270
- What did I tell you?
- Thanks, Zelda. You're a real pal.

1247
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:05,441
I want that girl off the lot at once!
She ain't gonna be my voice.

1248
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:07,234
Zelda told me everything.

1249
01:30:07,485 --> 01:30:10,279
- Thanks, Zelda. You're a real pal.
- Anytime, Don.

1250
01:30:10,488 --> 01:30:11,739
Look, Don and I...

1251
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:14,658
Don! Don't you dare call him Don!

1252
01:30:14,868 --> 01:30:17,870
I was calling him Don
before you were born.

1253
01:30:18,121 --> 01:30:19,830
I mean...
You were kissing him!

1254
01:30:20,123 --> 01:30:23,542
I was kissing her.
I happen to be in love with her.

1255
01:30:23,793 --> 01:30:27,838
That's ridiculous! Everybody knows
you're in love with me.

1256
01:30:28,006 --> 01:30:32,134
Ha, ha. Now look, Lina.
Try and understand this.

1257
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:34,011
I'm going to marry her.

1258
01:30:34,304 --> 01:30:36,972
Silly boy.
She ain't the marrying kind.

1259
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:40,017
She's a flirt
trying to get ahead by using you.

1260
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:44,647
Well, I'll put a stop to that!
I'm gonna go up and see R.F. right now!

1261
01:30:44,856 --> 01:30:46,357
A little late.
The picture's finished.

1262
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:48,859
If she weren't in it,
you'd be finished too.

1263
01:30:49,069 --> 01:30:52,029
As far as I can see,
she's the only one who's finished.

1264
01:30:52,322 --> 01:30:53,322
Who'll hear of her?

1265
01:30:53,531 --> 01:30:56,700
Everybody. Why do you think
Zelda's in such a sweat?

1266
01:30:56,910 --> 01:30:58,702
Kathy nearly stole
the picture from her.

1267
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:00,913
She's only doing you a favor
in The Dancing Cavalier.

1268
01:31:01,206 --> 01:31:04,208
And she's getting
full screen credit for it too.

1269
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:08,212
It'll say on the screen
that I don't talk and sing for myself?

1270
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:10,297
Of course. What do you think?

1271
01:31:10,548 --> 01:31:12,549
- They can't do that.
- It's already done.

1272
01:31:12,842 --> 01:31:15,094
There's a whole
publicity campaign planned.

1273
01:31:15,387 --> 01:31:16,804
Publicity?

1274
01:31:17,055 --> 01:31:18,889
They can't make a fool out of me.

1275
01:31:19,099 --> 01:31:21,725
They can't make a laughingstock
out of Lina Lamont.

1276
01:31:22,018 --> 01:31:24,895
What do they think I am,
dumb or something?

1277
01:31:25,188 --> 01:31:27,439
Why, I make more money...

1278
01:31:28,233 --> 01:31:30,109
...than Calvin Coolidge...

1279
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:32,194
...put together!

1280
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:38,951
ROD: "Monumental Pictures enthusiastic
over Lina's singing and dancing."

1281
01:31:39,202 --> 01:31:40,244
I never said that.

1282
01:31:40,412 --> 01:31:44,415
"Premiere tomorrow night to reveal
Lina Lamont, big musical talent."

1283
01:31:44,624 --> 01:31:47,751
You can't pull a switch like this
on the publicity department.

1284
01:31:47,961 --> 01:31:50,087
We were prepared
for the Selden campaign.

1285
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:52,423
Now you do this.
At least keep us informed.

1286
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:55,384
Wait a minute.
I don't know anything about this.

1287
01:31:55,593 --> 01:31:56,844
What are we gonna do?

1288
01:31:57,053 --> 01:31:58,053
LINA:
Nothing.

1289
01:31:59,055 --> 01:32:01,598
Absolutely nothing.

1290
01:32:01,891 --> 01:32:04,935
You wouldn't wanna call the papers
and say Lina Lamont...

1291
01:32:05,145 --> 01:32:07,438
...is a big fat liar.

1292
01:32:07,731 --> 01:32:09,273
Did you send this stuff out?

1293
01:32:09,566 --> 01:32:12,901
I gave an exclusive story
to every paper in town.

1294
01:32:13,111 --> 01:32:15,279
You'll never get away with it.
Call the papers.

1295
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:17,281
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1296
01:32:17,490 --> 01:32:19,575
Don't tell me what to do, Lina.

1297
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:23,287
What do you think I am,
dumb or something?

1298
01:32:23,496 --> 01:32:26,623
I had my lawyer go over my contract.

1299
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:27,958
Contract?

1300
01:32:28,251 --> 01:32:30,794
And I control my publicity, not you.

1301
01:32:30,962 --> 01:32:32,171
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1302
01:32:32,338 --> 01:32:35,382
The studio is responsible
for every word printed about me.

1303
01:32:35,592 --> 01:32:38,677
If I don't like it, I can sue.

1304
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:40,012
What?

1305
01:32:40,263 --> 01:32:42,473
I can sue.

1306
01:32:42,682 --> 01:32:45,642
If you tell the papers
about Kathy Selden...

1307
01:32:45,894 --> 01:32:50,606
...it would be "detrimental
and deleterious" to my career.

1308
01:32:51,274 --> 01:32:54,401
I could sue you for the whole studio.

1309
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:56,904
- That's a lot of nonsense.
- Says so.

1310
01:32:57,155 --> 01:32:58,530
Right here.

1311
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:03,327
Contract dated June 8, 1925,
paragraph 34, subdivision letter A.

1312
01:33:03,495 --> 01:33:05,537
"The party of the first part..."

1313
01:33:05,789 --> 01:33:07,623
- That's me.
- You win, Lina.

1314
01:33:07,832 --> 01:33:10,459
We better take Kathy's
credit card off the screen.

1315
01:33:10,668 --> 01:33:12,002
All right, go ahead.

1316
01:33:12,212 --> 01:33:14,421
Let's just get
this premiere over with.

1317
01:33:14,672 --> 01:33:16,006
Satisfied?

1318
01:33:16,216 --> 01:33:18,717
There's just one little thing more.

1319
01:33:19,177 --> 01:33:23,222
You want me to change the name of
the studio to Lamont Pictures, Inc.?

1320
01:33:23,515 --> 01:33:25,474
R.F., you're cute.

1321
01:33:25,683 --> 01:33:27,518
Now, I was just thinking.

1322
01:33:27,727 --> 01:33:30,229
You've given her
a part in Zelda's picture...

1323
01:33:30,522 --> 01:33:33,023
...and you'll give her
a bigger one in the next.

1324
01:33:33,316 --> 01:33:34,817
So, what?

1325
01:33:35,026 --> 01:33:37,736
If she's done such a grand job
doubling for my voice...

1326
01:33:38,029 --> 01:33:41,323
...don't you think she ought to
go on doing just that?

1327
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:43,826
- And nothing else.
- You're out of your mind.

1328
01:33:44,035 --> 01:33:47,079
I'm still more important
to the studio than she is.

1329
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:49,081
I wouldn't do that to her
in a million years.

1330
01:33:49,332 --> 01:33:52,835
You'd take her career away.
People don't do things like that.

People?

1332
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:56,713
I ain't people.

Oh, Pierre, Pierre, my darling.
At last, I've found you.

Oh, Pierre.

Oh, Pierre, hold me
in your arms always.

Yes, but Lamont! What a voice!
Isn't she marvelous?

01:35:00,570 --> 01:35:03,071
- It's going over wonderfully, isn't it?
- Yeah.

R.F., it's a real smash.

01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:57,209
- Congratulations. We owe you a lot.
- Thank you.

- Kathy, we made it!
- It's a miracle!

It's great, Don. Just great.

right on singing for me.

Listen, Lina.

I thought something was cooking
beneath those bleached curls.

Kathy has her own career.
She only did this for this picture.

01:36:50,555 --> 01:36:53,056
What's the matter?
Why don't you tell her off?

1380
01:36:53,266 --> 01:36:55,142
I'm confused.
This thing is so big...

1381
01:36:55,393 --> 01:36:58,562
- They're tearing the house apart.
- Take a curtain call.

1382
01:36:58,771 --> 01:37:01,064
I once gave you a cigar.
Can I have it back?

1383
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:04,568
Listen! I'm an avalanche!
Selden, you're stuck.

1384
01:37:04,861 --> 01:37:08,071
If this happens, get a new boy.
I won't stand for it.

1385
01:37:08,281 --> 01:37:11,700
Who needs you? They'd come to see me
if I played opposite a monkey!

1386
01:37:11,909 --> 01:37:13,243
Don's a smash too.

1387
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:16,079
I'll say a few words.
I'm still running the studio.

1388
01:37:16,289 --> 01:37:17,748
I'm not so sure!

1389
01:37:17,957 --> 01:37:21,251
You're Mr. Producer,
always running things, running me.

1390
01:37:21,461 --> 01:37:24,921
From now on, as far as I'm concerned,
I'm running things.

- Yeah.

You've gone a little too far.

1393
01:37:29,677 --> 01:37:31,928
- They're yelling for a speech.
- A speech?

1394
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:35,057
Yeah, everybody's always making
speeches for me.

1395
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:39,603
Tonight, I'm gonna do my own talking.
I'm gonna make the speech!

1396

DON: Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

This is Lina's big night
and she's entitled to do the talking.

I can't tell you...

1401
01:37:58,915 --> 01:38:01,083
...how thrilled we are
at your reception...

1402
01:38:01,292 --> 01:38:05,295
...for The Dancing Cavalier,
our first musical picture together.

into your humdrum lives...

...it makes us feel
as though our hard work...

...ain't been in vain for nothing.

1406

Bless you all.

1407
01:38:18,142 --> 01:38:19,851
She didn't sound that way
in the picture.

1408
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:21,728

What am I gonna do?

1414

We've got it.
Get a mike set up back of that curtain.

1415
01:38:41,833 --> 01:38:45,168
Kathy, come here.
Kathy will stand back of there and sing.

1416
01:38:45,378 --> 01:38:48,839
She'll be back of the curtain singing,
and I'll be in front...

1417
01:38:49,048 --> 01:38:50,757
- Like in the picture?
- Right.

1418
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,843
You've gotta do it. This is too big.

1419
01:38:53,052 --> 01:38:57,013
She's got a five-year contract with me.
Get over to that mike.

You heard him, Kathy. Now do it!

1421
01:38:59,809 --> 01:39:00,976
I'll do it, Don.

1422
01:39:01,185 --> 01:39:03,019
But I never want to see you again...
