1
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:18,326
We were sailing along

2
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:22,197
On Moonlight Bay

3
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:26,169
We could hear the voices ringing

4
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:28,297
They seemed to say

5
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,363
Wish we could stay

6
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,068
You have stolen her heart

7
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:33,805
What a romance it's going to be

8
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,074
Now don't go away

9
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,173
Nobody here but you and me

10
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,118
As We sang love's old sweet song

11
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:45,588
On Moonlight Bay

12
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:49,491
We were sailing along

13
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:53,395
On Moonlight Bay

14
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:57,333
We could hear the voices ringing

15
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,236
They seemed to say

16
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:05,140
You have stolen her heart

17
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:09,543
Now don't go away

18
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:13,550
As We sang love's old sweet song

19
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:17,452
On Moonlight Bay

20
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,322
As We sang love's old sweet song

21
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,486
On Moonlight Bay

22
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,726
On Moonlight Bay

23
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:07,964
Hello. What's your name?

24
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,902
I guess we're going to be neighbors.

25
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:21,748
Hello, Max.
How do you like our new house?

26
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:31,528
Alice?

27
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,734
- Alice?
- Here I am.

28
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:40,998
Where?

29
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,971
I'm in here, George.

30
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,637
Oh, hello. Well, how you getting along?

31
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:52,375
George Wadsworth Winfield,
how could you do this to us?

32
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,145
- Do what?
- Well, it's too big.

33
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,380
There are too many rooms. Nothing fits.

34
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,353
Now, Alice, that's no tone of voice

35
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:01,858
for the fortunate wife of the man
who just bought this mansion.

36
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:04,657
Please, George, it's been a very trying day.

37
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,719
The drapes are too short.

38
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:10,666
The rugs are too small.
I can't find a place for the piano anywhere.

39
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:14,967
You're just tired. Believe me, honey,
once everything is arranged,

40
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,009
this will be just the kind of a house
we've always dreamed of.

41
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,270
You've always dreamed of.

42
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,209
- Well...
- And, as far as I'm concerned,

43
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,043
you can stick that sign back on the lawn
and sell the house.

44
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:26,481
Now, honey, you're just upset.
it's all very simple.

45
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,076
When you get the carpets down,
put the piano over there,

46
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,349
a few pictures on the wall...

47
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,787
Who is that boy?

48
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:42,025
A neighbor's child.
He lives across the street.

49
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,761
Well, he makes me nervous.

50
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:46,804
We were all so happy and comfortable
in the other place.

51
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,965
You have to move us here
where we're practically foreigners.

52
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:52,703
Well, it's only a mile and a half
from the old house,

53
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:55,939
and I didn't notice us
crossing any frontiers on the way.

54
00:03:56,336 --> 00:04:01,012
A mile and a half closer to your bank.
Of course, I don't mind for myself

55
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,112
leaving behind the friends
I made over 20 years,

56
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:07,647
but I don't see how you could do this
to your own children.

57
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,387
I'm doing it for the children.

58
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,793
I thought if we moved
to a refined neighborhood,

59
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,387
some of it might rub off on them.

60
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,194
- George!
- Well, it's true.

61
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:19,203
I'd like my daughter to become a wife,
not a second baseman.

62
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,829
Where is she?

63
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:24,932
Marjie? Marjie?
There, you see what I mean?

64
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,171
Marjie, put that chair down!

65
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:31,312
Good gracious,
haven't you got enough muscles?

66
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,907
I was just trying to keep busy,

67
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:36,351
so I wouldn't have to think about
what you've done to us.

68
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,615
You, too?

69
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:40,715
Well, all the kids I know live all the way
on the other side of town, Papa.

70
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,418
- See?
- Yeah, kids.

71
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:43,859
I thought if we moved here,

72
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,988
you might meet some nice, refined
young man. Maybe get married.

73
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,499
Papa, you're so old-fashioned.

74
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:00,271
- What's the matter with him?
- Max don't like this house.

75
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,403
Well, you don't say.

76
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,913
He's been hunting all morning
and he can't find any rats.

77
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,813
Well, we'll have some installed.

78
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:09,718
George, don't be so obstinate.
Why can't we move back?

79
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:15,321
I'm dead.
Mr. Winfield, that kitchen's too big.

80
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,691
Another country heard from.

81
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:23,096
I'm telling you, it must be 30 feet
from the stove to the cupboard.

82
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,899
I'm being paid to be a cook,
not a cross-country runner.

83
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,599
Stella, bring me some hot coffee.

84
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:33,405
Okay, but it'll be cold
by the time I hike back.

85
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,880
That youngster is certainly curious.

86
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:50,724
Wesley, did you notice the neighbor's boy?
He's just your age.

87
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,387
I hate him.

88
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,160
You haven't even met him.
Now, go on out and be friendly.

89
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,529
No.

90
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,694
Wesley. Be friendly!

91
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,672
Come on, Max.

92
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,712
My old man has a real gun.

93
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,257
- He has not.
- He has, too.

94
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,156
Anyways, I bet it's a popgun.

95
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:26,186
It's only the gun that Jesse James used
to hold up a train with, that's all.

96
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,465
- Jesse James?
- Yeah.

97
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:31,627
- You're fooling me.
- I am not.

98
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,034
Has he really got it?

99
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:36,733
He keeps it in a trunk in the attic.
it's got a kick like a cannon.

100
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,867
It'll knock you flat on your back.

101
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:42,208
Well, how about getting it
and letting me shoot it, huh?

102
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:44,145
Well, come on, how about it?

103
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:45,477
Well...

104
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:48,216
- All right. Come on.
- Come on, Max.

105
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:52,888
Well, that's fine.
Everything's off to a good start.

106
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,461
Strike!

107
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,904
- Strike!
- Hey, fellas, he's hurt!

108
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:15,479
- Hey, help me get him up!
- Well, that ends the game, I guess.

109
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,208
Hey, you need somebody
to take his place?

110
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,648
- Hey, it's a girl!
- No girls in the game.

111
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,912
Oh, let her play. We'll have some fun.

112
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:23,544
We don't want any girls.

113
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:27,853
The game's ruined anyway.
We might as well, I guess. Here!

114
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:31,385
- Thanks, sport.
- Let's see you hit something now.

115
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,830
Come on, gang!

116
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,467
Let's see you slug it out.

117
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:40,128
Here's the one.

118
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:41,694
That's it!

119
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:45,306
Hey! That's it!

120
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,002
Grab your second!

121
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:51,005
- Come on!
- Come on, get over to second.

122
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:02,424
All right, now, come on, boys! Come on!
Let's go for it, boys! Bring her in!

123
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,257
Shorten the windup, sonny,
I'm going home.

124
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:09,789
Safe!

125
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,330
- Hey, that was good!
- Great!

126
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,471
Let's see her.

127
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:27,306
Oh, I'm up.

128
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:28,441
I dare you to shoot her.

129
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,216
Not out here. it'll make too much noise.

130
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,553
- Well, let's go in the barn.
- Okay.

131
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:39,656
She won't pull.

132
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,791
- Bet I can pull it.
- Well, all right, you try her, then.

133
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:44,824
Well...

134
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:49,068
Wesley! What are you doing
with that gun?

135
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,801
Why, you could kill somebody
with this thing.

136
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,206
Watch it! it's cocked.

137
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:55,269
You don't have to tell me.
I'm going to fix that right now!

138
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,336
Jim, Mother wants you!

139
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,316
All right, all right. Come on.

140
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,649
I know you're around here somewhere.

141
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,690
Imagine leaving a thing like this around
where children can get their hands on it.

142
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:07,747
Marjie, be careful!

143
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,191
Wesley! You keep your hands
off of this gun!

144
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,422
Jim!

145
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,363
Look.

146
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,596
It's my brother. He's dead.

147
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,971
It might be better for you if I were.

148
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,135
I'm gonna teach you kids a lesson.

149
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,576
Run, Marjorie! Come on!

150
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:31,581
Give me that gun, you little brat.
Come here!

151
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,773
- Mr. Winfield?
- Yes?

152
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,242
- I'm William Sherman.
- Who?

153
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:04,042
I met your daughter in the barn.

154
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,607
Oh, yes, yes.
We've been expecting you. Come in.

155
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:09,209
Thank you, sir.

156
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,223
Wesley, will you tell Marjorie
she has a visitor?

157
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,418
I guess she knows it.

158
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:18,223
She's been watching out the window
for the last half-hour.

159
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,662
Won't you step into the living room?
She'll be right down.

160
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,994
Thank you.

161
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,294
Not bad.

162
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:28,198
- Marjie, will you stop fidgeting?
- I can't wait, Mother.

163
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,833
You want that young man to know that
you've never had on a party dress before?

164
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:35,140
And, another thing, try not to walk
like a first baseman.

165
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:38,341
- I won't. Can I look now?
- Yes, now.

166
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:42,285
Oh, Mother! Mother, I'm beautiful!

167
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:43,342
I know, dear.

168
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,013
Isn't it pretty?

169
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:50,951
- What's the matter?
- Sometimes, nature needs a little help.

170
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:55,563
- Oh, Mother.
- All's fair in love and war.

171
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,374
Hello, William.

172
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,248
Good evening, Marjorie.

173
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,311
- Mother, this is Mr. Sherman.
- Good evening, Mr. Sherman.

174
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,617
How do you do, Mrs. Winfield?

175
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,817
These are for you.

176
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,621
Oh, they're lovely.

177
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,529
Thank you very much.

178
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,188
Well?

179
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,893
Well, I guess, we'd better be going.

180
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,232
- Yes, have a good time.
- We will.

181
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,033
Thank you.

182
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,573
Oh, your hat.

183
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,233
- Thank you.
- Night.

184
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,210
- I'll just put these in water.
- Thanks. Good night.

185
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,612
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.

186
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,183
Is that our daughter?

187
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:52,814
It's amazing
what a little paint and powder will do.

188
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,289
Yes, isn't it?

189
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:13,069
It's no use. I've told her 1,000 times,
a gentleman always walks on the outside.

190
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:17,274
I hope he doesn't try to dance with her.
He's liable to get spiked.

191
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:44,436
The University of Indiana. I'm a senior.

192
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,866
It must be wonderful.

193
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:49,642
It's a farce.

194
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:53,411
All the fellas are interested in
is playing football and baseball.

195
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,485
And women.

196
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,521
Women and more women.

197
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,988
Can you think of a bigger waste of time?

198
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,215
What's wrong with baseball?

199
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,490
Baseball? it's the national insanity.

200
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:07,729
At a time like this,

201
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,464
when civilization is crumbling
beneath our feet,

202
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:14,630
our generation is playing baseball
and singing songs like...

203
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,840
"We were sailing along

204
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,441
"on Moonlight Bay." isn't that silly?

205
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,247
I rather liked it.

206
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,184
You heard the rest of it?

207
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:35,886
You have stolen her heart

208
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,421
"Now, don't go away."

209
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:44,963
As We sang love's old sweet song

210
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:48,562
On Moonlight Bay

211
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:53,108
That must have been written by a man
with a glass of beer in one hand

212
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,008
and a rhyming dictionary in the other.

213
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,172
I think it's beautiful.

214
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:01,313
- Maybe we'd better dance, huh?
- Dance?

215
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,286
All right.

216
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:28,543
Tickets, five cents each, please.

217
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,539
Five cents each?

218
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,943
You have to buy happiness these days.

219
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:57,964
Shall we dance?

220
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:01,135
William, that's one of these new dances
that I don't know.

221
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,578
- Well, this is just a two-step.
- That's the one.

222
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,741
You leave everything to me.

223
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,621
I guess I thought you were a southpaw.

224
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,314
I mean left-handed.

225
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,969
Excuse me, miss. I think you dropped this.

226
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:07,869
- I did?
- Yes.

227
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,845
Would you excuse me?

228
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,752
Pardon me, your girl dropped this.

229
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:27,392
...even better with your eyesight.
Flyball is a game of accuracy.

230
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,366
Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! Step right up, folks.

231
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:34,063
Everyone wins at Sunny Jim's,
the most popular game on the midway!

232
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,037
Won't you come back
for just one more dance, please?

233
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,099
William, I just want to go home.
I shouldn't have come in the first place.

234
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,768
It was all a horrible mistake.

235
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,404
Step right up, folks. it's an honest game.

236
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,075
You hear that? Come on, I'll win you a doll.

237
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:49,711
I love to lose, folks.
I'm really a retired millionaire.

238
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:54,224
And this is how I wile away the idle hours.
Here you are, son. Three balls for a nickel.

239
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,883
All I have to do is knock the bottles down?

240
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,053
Knock them off the shelf,
you win a coupon.

241
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,290
A coupon? Well, how do you win the doll?

242
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,832
Three coupons and it's all yours.

243
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:07,098
So simple a child could do it.
People win it everyday.

244
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,662
Can't keep them on the shelves.

245
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,503
Well, here goes.

246
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,338
That's one coupon.

247
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,348
I'm sorry, son.
You weren't paying attention.

248
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,042
I said, "Off the table."

249
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:22,577
All right.

250
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:32,254
Well, well, well, the first loser today.

251
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,228
You've got lead in the bottom
of those bottles.

252
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:36,288
Twenty-twenty vision, eh, son?

253
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:39,700
Step right up, folks.
Everybody wins at Sunny Jim's.

254
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:42,637
He's a fake. Just like everything else
in this world.

255
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,700
- Let's go.
- Just a minute, friend.

256
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,367
Just to show you
my heart's in the right place,

257
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:47,775
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

258
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:51,212
I'll give three chances,
absolutely free, to the young lady.

259
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,408
- Oh, no, I...
- it's free.

260
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:55,077
Free! Free to the young lady!

261
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,053
Go ahead, Marjorie, it's probably
the first thing he has ever given away.

262
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,885
It's an honest game.

263
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,872
- It is an honest game!
- I won the doll.

264
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,212
Well, the young lady proved
it can be done.

265
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,615
Too bad she wasn't paying for her turn.

266
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,415
Now, wait a minute, what about that doll?

267
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:31,750
Come on, William, let's go home.

268
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,450
No! I'm not leaving here
till I get that doll.

269
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,891
Now, listen, move along, son.
You had your turn and you lost.

270
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,156
The young lady had
a couple of practice shots. That's all.

271
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,960
All right, here they are, folks.
Step right up there. Three for...

272
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,432
I don't like grafters or cheats
in high places or low.

273
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,164
Look, there's a soapbox
around the corner, kid. Beat it, will you?

274
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,968
We let men like you get away
with little things.

275
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:53,737
And before we know it, you've taken away
our lives, our liberty and our property.

276
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,212
Why, in you runs the blood
of Genghis Khan and Attila the Hun!

277
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,146
When did they let you out, kid?

278
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,650
Here you are, friends, three for five.
Who's gonna have...

279
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:04,881
I'm not a man who believes in force,
but your type should be strung up

280
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:08,413
to the nearest lamppost by the free men
of the world before it's too late!

281
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,587
Here, take the doll and leave me alone!
All right, step right up, folks!

282
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,894
You hear? Everybody wins at Sunny Jim's!
I tell you...

283
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,739
William, I had a wonderful time.

284
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:27,333
So did I, Marjorie, and to think
we might never have met

285
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,935
if you hadn't taken a shot at me.

286
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,676
Don't joke about that.
Why, I might have killed you.

287
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,981
What's one life more or less
when all of Europe's bathed in blood?

288
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,750
Won't you come in and have
a nice cool glass of buttermilk?

289
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:42,282
Yeah. I guess I'd like that.

290
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,167
- Marjorie?
- Yes, William?

291
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,733
In all fairness,
I've got to tell you something.

292
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:01,903
What?

293
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,205
I don't believe in marriage.

294
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,376
But I just asked you in
for some buttermilk.

295
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,115
Well, I didn't want to drink it
under false pretenses.

296
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:15,590
Well, my goodness!
Maybe I don't believe in marriage, either.

297
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:23,329
Now, please, don't be angry, Marjorie.
it's nothing personal. it's just that...

298
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:28,201
Well, I think that marriage is slavery
for the woman and prison for the man.

299
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,984
I think that if two
people are truly in love,

300
00:20:30,985 --> 00:20:33,175
they needn't be bound by convention.

301
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,678
Well, my goodness! So do I.

302
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,748
- Marjorie, I...
- Yes, William?

303
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:43,379
What happened?

304
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:46,946
That's the new power plant.
It breaks down regularly. Every night.

305
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:50,425
Oh, my. How long do the lights stay off?

306
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,925
Sometimes for hours.

307
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,797
Maybe I better light a match.

308
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:13,974
Well, I guess you better
show me to the door.

309
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,076
Yes. I guess I better.

310
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,821
Marjorie, I'd like to call on you again.

311
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,920
- When?
- Would tomorrow morning be too soon?

312
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,430
Oh, no.

313
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,736
I guess you better light another match.

314
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:42,637
Marjorie, I think you're the most beautiful

315
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,840
and the most feminine girl I've ever met.

316
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:48,476
Thank you, William. Thank you very much.

317
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,955
Well, good night.

318
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,390
Good night.

319
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,630
I guess you better light another match.

320
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,233
I don't have any more.

321
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:19,805
We don't really have
any buttermilk, either.

322
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:45,041
Doesn't he ever go home?

323
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:48,741
Alice, can't you get her in here
to finish her lunch?

324
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:53,146
Let her be, George.
I never thought I'd see the day.

325
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,652
She's sitting cow-eyed in the swing
and he's playing records for her.

326
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,018
I'll have to ask that young man
his intentions.

327
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:00,181
Oh, George.

328
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:02,657
I'll do it very discreetly,
but it has to be done.

329
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,955
Marjorie's young and very inexperienced.

330
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:07,792
All she knows about men
is their batting averages.

331
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:11,426
In case you're interested,
this one's batting a thousand.

332
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:18,040
- Let's play the other side, huh, William?
- All right, Marjorie.

333
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:22,441
- Cuddle Up a Little Closer?
- Yeah, I like that.

334
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:55,571
It's Wesley. The lattice
at the front of the porch is loose

335
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:58,478
and he crawls under
and comes out all bugs.

336
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,195
Wesley, you come out of there right now!

337
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:18,026
I said come out of there!

338
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:26,400
What are you trying to do?
Choke a person to death?

339
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:30,709
I may have to sit here for the next
half-hour just trying to catch my breath.

340
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:37,917
Here, Wesley, maybe this'll make you
breathe a little easier.

341
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:41,253
Gee, thanks! I feel fine now!

342
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:43,675
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

343
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:46,018
Why, Father,
I thought you'd gone back to town.

344
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,648
No, I thought I'd like to have
a little talk with William

345
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:52,058
before he leaves for college
and his studies of... Law?

346
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:55,098
- No, sir, not law.
- Then it must be medicine.

347
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:59,101
Well, a doctor these days can support
a wife and a family very nicely.

348
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:00,158
Father.

349
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:02,771
- I major in English literature.
- Oh, I see.

350
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:06,139
Well, we can find something else for you.

351
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,844
What do you think of banking?

352
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:16,249
Well, frankly, sir, I feel that every bank
in the country should be blown up.

353
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:21,548
Tea? Would anyone care for some tea?
Iced tea, Father?

354
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:23,593
What did you say, young man?

355
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:25,889
Well, I didn't mean it literally, sir.

356
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:27,760
It's just that every thinking person knows

357
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:31,062
that banks are completely
unproductive and unnecessary.

358
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:33,295
Why, they're parasites on society.

359
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:35,338
I'd like some tea. Wouldn't you, William?

360
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:37,270
Unnecessary and unproductive?

361
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,570
- And, I can prove it.
- Oh, you can?

362
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:42,771
- Yes, sir, I can.
- Lemon or cream?

363
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,472
Do you have some money?

364
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,840
Yes.

365
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:52,583
Fine. A five-dollar bill.

366
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:55,853
This is the commodity
in which the banks deal. Money,

367
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:57,416
the root of all evil.

368
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:00,453
Now, suppose it were all destroyed.

369
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,623
Has anything really been lost?

370
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:08,034
Is there any less clothing, less food,
less love in the world now?

371
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:09,231
Young man...

372
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:13,106
William, Father is vice president
of the First National Bank!

373
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,943
Holy cow! Did I do this?

374
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,242
Marjorie, get in the house!

375
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:21,750
Father, it's nothing serious. it's just
something they teach William at college.

376
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,912
Well, until they teach him
how to support a wife,

377
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,980
I suggest you find yourself
another young man.

378
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:08,040
Seems to me a person wouldn't sing
so loud in the morning

379
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:10,916
when they know
another person's got a sick headache.

380
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,717
Seems to me a person always gets
a sick headache on school days.

381
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:15,655
Well, you wouldn't care
if I went to the hospital

382
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:18,216
and had to be operated on, I suppose.

383
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:22,959
How many times do I have to call you?
Miss Marjorie, your breakfast is ready.

384
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,558
All right, Stella.
I just want to finish this letter.

385
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:29,002
Finish it later.
We're not serving é Ia carte, you know.

386
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,061
All right.

387
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:33,075
You, too. You're gonna be late for school.

388
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,847
You eat every bit of that cereal.
You're a growing boy and you need it.

389
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,246
I hate it!

390
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:47,920
Stella, dust off the piano.
Hubert Wakely is coming to call again.

391
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:52,525
Men have been buzzing around here
like flies ever since you gave up baseball.

392
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:57,397
This place is beginning to look like
the YMCA on a rainy afternoon.

393
00:30:57,655 --> 00:31:00,568
Your father seems to think very highly
of Mr. Wakely.

394
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:03,663
Why wouldn't he?
Hubert is steady, reliable,

395
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:07,471
has a fine job teaching music
and he's just as stuffy as Father.

396
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,068
- Marjie!
- Well, he is.

397
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,237
Hey, Wesley!

398
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,781
- I got to go.
- You haven't finished your breakfast.

399
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:14,874
You wouldn't want me
to be late for school, would you?

400
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:20,520
Excuse me.

401
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:25,993
I wonder what you get for manslaughter
in this state.

402
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,855
Hi, Jim.

403
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:32,128
- You got your letter?
- What letter's that?

404
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,033
You know what old Miss Stevens said.

405
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:37,938
"A model letter to a friend
on a subject of general interest."

406
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:39,270
Oh, no.

407
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:43,472
Well, she'll only keep you in
after school two or three hours, I guess.

408
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:47,710
Oh, no, she won't. I just remembered.
I got a letter all written out!

409
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,944
Wait for me, Jim! I'll be right out.

410
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,663
Excuse me.

411
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:06,729
Stella!

412
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:52,313
Now, children,
it is time for English composition.

413
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:56,375
I know how hard you all must have worked
on your letters for this morning,

414
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:59,354
so I have a little surprise for you.

415
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:04,290
I'm going to let you read some of them
aloud before you hand them in.

416
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,454
Now, won't that be nice?

417
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:17,531
- Cora Claypool, you may read yours.
- Yes, ma'am!

418
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:20,735
"Dear Cousin Sadie,
I thought I would write you today

419
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:24,143
"on some subject of general interest,
and so I thought

420
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:27,411
"l would tell you
about the subject of our courthouse.

421
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:30,715
"it is a very fine building situated in
the center of the city,

422
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:34,484
"and a visit to the building after school
well repays for the visit.

423
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:39,155
"Upon entrance, we find upon our left
the office of the county clerk,

424
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:43,165
"and upon our right, a number of windows
affording a view of the street.

425
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:47,169
"And so we proceed, finding on both sides
much of general interest.

426
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:50,536
"The building was begun in 1886 A.D.,

427
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:53,371
"and it was through in 1887 A.D.

428
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:58,642
"it is four stories high and made
of stone, pressed brick, wood and tiles

429
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:04,619
"with a tower, or cupola,
127' 7" from the ground.

430
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:08,555
"Among subjects of general interest
told by the janitor,

431
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:12,891
"we learned that this architect
of the building was a man named Flanner

432
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,088
"and the foundation..."

433
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:17,895
Wesley Winfield, you may read your letter.

434
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:20,367
- Ma'am?
- You may read your letter.

435
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:21,733
Yes, ma'am.

436
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,500
- Have you prepared one?
- Yes, ma'am.

437
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:30,508
But you're going to find out
that you forgot to bring it, aren't you?

438
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,313
No, ma'am, I got it.

439
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:37,251
Well! We'll listen
to what you found time to prepare.

440
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,376
For once.

441
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:44,823
"Dear friend, you call me beautiful
but I am really not beautiful,

442
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:48,125
"and, at times, I doubt if I am even pretty.
Though my hair may be beautiful

443
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:52,362
"and even if it is true that my eyes are
like the blue stars in heaven..."

444
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,597
Go on.

445
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:58,907
Oh, no.

446
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,203
Proceed.

447
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:05,673
"A tremor thrills my being when I recall

448
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:08,615
"your last words to me that last...

449
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:10,516
"That last..."

450
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:11,980
Go on.

451
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,253
"That last evening in the moonlight

452
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:18,851
"when you... You..."

453
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:23,195
Wesley, you will go on.
And you will stop that stammering.

454
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:26,426
"You kissed my shoulder

455
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:30,496
"and said that you would like to love me
forever and ever and..."

456
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:31,835
Wesley.

457
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:34,936
"And that if you believed in marriage,

458
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:39,038
"you would want me to.
Yours Respectfully, Wesley Winfield."

459
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:43,417
May I leave the room?

460
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,215
Bring me that letter.

461
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:02,537
You will sit there until no more
"treemors" thrill your being.

462
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:39,936
That was wonderful, Hubert!
Just wonderful!

463
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:42,602
You must come again soon.

464
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,840
I'm in no hurry, princess.

465
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:49,851
As Shakespeare once said,
"if music be the food of love, play on."

466
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:51,250
Did Shakespeare say that?

467
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:55,416
Yes, princess. I have an idea.
Let's sing something together.

468
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:01,553
I would like to very much, Hubert,
but I have an appointment at the dentist.

469
00:37:56,874 --> 00:38:00,185
Hey, Wesley! How's your beautiful hair?

470
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,790
Wesley.

471
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:15,293
You stay out of the living room.
Your sister is entertaining a caller.

472
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,034
Is he telling her
her eyes are like the blue stars in heaven?

473
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:20,871
Now, where did you pick that up?

474
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:22,706
I've been around.

475
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:26,214
Well, just the same,
you stay out of that living room.

476
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:35,352
I'll get even on that Marjorie.

477
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:38,593
Well, why don't you get even on her, then?

478
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,186
All right, I will get even on her.

479
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,960
Miss Winfield, would you care
for another apple?

480
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:46,959
No, thanks. Hubert, really, I...

481
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:49,766
Miss Winfield, when I look into your eyes,

482
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,103
I recall those immortal words
of Tennyson...

483
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,234
Anybody seen Max?

484
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:55,834
- Who?
- Max, my dog.

485
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,971
You seen him around here anywhere?

486
00:38:58,035 --> 00:38:59,480
We haven't seen him.

487
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:03,485
That's funny. Well, I guess,
there's no use looking for him.

488
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,543
He isn't anywheres around.

489
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:07,918
Guess I'll sit down.

490
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,390
Kind of tired of standing up anyway.

491
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:20,064
Wesley, I just remembered,

492
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:22,001
I was looking out of the window
a minute ago,

493
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:25,131
and I saw a dog run across the street
and turn the corner.

494
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,266
Little or big?

495
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:30,301
Max is a little dog. Of course, if it was
a little dog, it must have been Max.

496
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:33,281
It was little. It was a little bit of a dog.

497
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:37,513
No, couldn't have been Max.
Max, he's kind of a middle-sized dog.

498
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,027
- By George!
- Do you have to go, Hubert?

499
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:51,066
No, no, it isn't that, but, by the way,

500
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:53,568
it seems a pity to be missing
the fine weather.

501
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,934
I wonder if I could persuade you
to take a little walk.

502
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:57,063
No, Hubert, really, I...

503
00:39:57,128 --> 00:40:00,735
One can talk better out in the open,
don't you think?

504
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:05,837
All right. I have to get my hat.

505
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,644
I'll get mine, too.

506
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,692
Ready, Hubert?

507
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:25,325
Yes, but better hurry.
I think We've given him the slip.

508
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:34,376
What kept you?

509
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,405
Oh, no.

510
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:40,215
My, it's a brisk day, isn't it?

511
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,614
It's lovely.

512
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:44,949
I believe this is our first walk together.

513
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:46,352
Oh, is it?

514
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:52,055
Do you like walking fast?

515
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,962
Oh, yes. You set the pace.
I think I can keep up with you.

516
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:01,760
Say, what's the rush?
We going to a fire or something?

517
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:17,108
Your dog is going home.
Don't you think you should look after him?

518
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:20,280
Why worry about him?
He's smarter than we are.

519
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:24,224
Miss Winfield, keep your head up
and breathe through your nose.

520
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:26,318
Is that how it's done?

521
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:00,693
Hubert, I really enjoyed that little Walk,
didn't you?

522
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,424
Won't you come in?

523
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:07,162
No, I think I'd better go home.

524
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:11,434
Home? What's the matter?
You tired or something?

525
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,807
Come on!
Let's go around the block again, huh?

526
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:19,511
Would you like to, Hubert?

527
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:22,046
- Good night.
- Good night.

528
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:30,425
Middle-sized.

529
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,825
You're an angel.

530
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:48,773
One, two, three. Waltz, two, three.

531
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:51,642
One, two, three. Waltz, two, three.

532
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:57,675
Dip, two, three. Dip, two, three.
Dip, two, three. Dip, two, three.

533
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:03,783
One, two, glide. One, two, glide.
One, two, glide. One, two, glide.

534
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:09,627
One, two, three. Waltz, two, three.
One, two, three. Waltz, two, three.

535
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:12,497
One, two, three. One, two...

536
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:37,854
My dear Mr. Winfield,
young gentlemen in society

537
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:41,886
do not scratch their backs
when they are dancing with a young lady.

538
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:45,024
Nobody else is itching. I do not itch.

539
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:48,593
I cannot continue with the dance
if you must itch.

540
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:52,129
In heaven's name,
why must you always itch?

541
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:54,603
Piano, please.

542
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:58,875
Now, everybody,
take a deep breath. Inhale.

543
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,578
One, two, three. One, two, three.

544
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,020
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three.

545
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:13,119
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three.

546
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:19,156
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three.

547
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:22,602
One, two, three. One, two, three.

548
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:27,501
Class dismissed.

549
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:40,215
- Come on, Marjorie.
- Wesley, you hurry on home now.

550
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:41,813
Why? Aren't you coming?

551
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:44,758
Wesley, I have to stay here and talk
to Professor Barson about something.

552
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:46,158
Again?

553
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:48,389
Now, you go on. I'll be home later.

554
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:12,154
Professor, I'm all ready now.

555
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:18,849
Marjie, you must love that boy very much

556
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:21,522
to come here every Friday for a month

557
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:23,758
to dance with an old man.

558
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:26,700
- Am I doing any better?
- Much better.

559
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:29,670
- Well, what's left for today?
- The turkey trot!

560
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,870
The turkey trot.

561
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:36,002
Such a dance I don't blame you
for wanting to learn in secret.

562
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:41,880
Better I teach you a beautiful
schottische or Viennese waltz.

563
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:47,421
But, Professor, nobody waltzes anymore.

564
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:50,186
And if I'm asking a young man
to come all the way from college

565
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,954
to take me to the charity ball,

566
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:54,962
I want to be sure that I can dance
whatever the orchestra plays.

567
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:59,057
Such dances they play now.
The grizzly bear! The bunny hug!

568
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:03,833
The kangaroo dip!
Am I a dance teacher or an animal trainer?

569
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:05,932
Oh, all right!

570
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:08,567
Adolf, you should excuse the expression,

571
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:10,303
the turkey trot.

572
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:14,876
You start with your right foot.

573
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:21,272
Glide.

574
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:25,212
Glide.

575
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:32,186
Yay, Marjorie! One, two, three, glide.
One, two, three, glide.

576
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:35,787
Old Marjie can't find no dancing partner.

577
00:47:39,723 --> 00:47:40,963
Come on, hit her.

578
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:07,853
Yay, Marjorie! One, two, three, glide.
One, two, three, glide.

579
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,464
My leg. Oh, my leg.

580
00:48:19,913 --> 00:48:23,122
But, Marjorie,
you haven't given me one sensible reason.

581
00:48:24,518 --> 00:48:27,124
Quiet, fellas. Long distance.

582
00:48:29,523 --> 00:48:32,026
But why don't you want me to come?

583
00:48:32,092 --> 00:48:33,833
You're not going with anybody else,
are you?

584
00:48:33,894 --> 00:48:35,464
Oh, no, William.

585
00:48:35,529 --> 00:48:38,203
It's just that I don't feel like dancing
with anyone

586
00:48:38,265 --> 00:48:40,802
while all of Europe is in flames.

587
00:48:40,867 --> 00:48:43,177
W/1at's Europe got to do with us?

588
00:48:43,236 --> 00:48:44,772
Anyway, it's a charity ball.

589
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:47,751
It's for war relief,
so you don't have to feel guilty.

590
00:48:47,808 --> 00:48:49,879
I'll be there Christmas Eve.

591
00:48:50,477 --> 00:48:52,457
Gosh, Marjorie,
after all the trouble I went to

592
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,082
to square things with your father.

593
00:48:54,147 --> 00:48:56,184
But I just don't think it's right, William,

594
00:48:56,249 --> 00:48:58,126
with poor little Belgium and all, and...

595
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,960
So you might as well stay where you are,

596
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:03,263
because I'm not going to dance
with anybody. Goodbye.

597
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:10,239
- Give me your arm.
- Will you please hold still?

598
00:49:10,297 --> 00:49:12,573
- Now, where's his head?
- Give me your arm.

599
00:49:12,633 --> 00:49:14,112
- You're not trying, Wesley.
- I am!

600
00:49:14,167 --> 00:49:16,841
Will you please hold still
and put your arm through here?

601
00:49:16,903 --> 00:49:19,941
Tie it up nice and tight, Marjie.
Just wait one second.

602
00:49:20,007 --> 00:49:21,645
It's going to belong enough.

603
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,278
Hey, you're choking me.

604
00:49:23,343 --> 00:49:25,584
I will in a minute if you don't hold still.

605
00:49:25,646 --> 00:49:27,489
Now, turn around for Mother.

606
00:49:28,181 --> 00:49:30,286
What are you trying to do?
Stab a person to death?

607
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:32,125
Just stand still, Wesley.

608
00:49:32,185 --> 00:49:34,187
Well, hurry up.
I want to go to the picture show.

609
00:49:34,254 --> 00:49:35,597
You wait until we get this fitted,

610
00:49:35,656 --> 00:49:37,636
and then you can take it off
and go to your picture show.

611
00:49:37,691 --> 00:49:39,830
What kind of thing you got on me?

612
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:41,566
Exactly what all the other children

613
00:49:41,628 --> 00:49:45,007
in Hubert Wakely's group of
little Christmas carolers will be wearing.

614
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:49,741
Well, let old Wakely stand out in the snow
and sing Christmas carols, not me.

615
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:54,511
- Here's Mr. Wesley's wings.
- Oh, they're fine, Stella.

616
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:56,645
Yeah. Careful, the gluing's still wet.

617
00:49:57,377 --> 00:49:58,822
Look. They just fit.

618
00:50:01,148 --> 00:50:02,354
There.

619
00:50:02,983 --> 00:50:04,826
Now, hold real still.

620
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,956
I don't know.

621
00:50:08,021 --> 00:50:11,025
Seems almost a sacrilege,
dressing Wesley as an angel.

622
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:14,163
Somehow, I think he'd look more natural
with horns and a tail.

623
00:50:14,227 --> 00:50:16,537
Stella. He looks wonderful in this.

624
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:19,042
There's something
almost spiritual about him.

625
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:22,740
Oh, it is. it's a beautiful costume.
Look, Mother.

626
00:50:23,003 --> 00:50:25,142
You'd never know it was our Wesley.

627
00:50:25,205 --> 00:50:27,617
Darling, you're the picture
of angelic beauty.

628
00:50:27,674 --> 00:50:29,779
Come on. Take a look at yourself.

629
00:50:34,715 --> 00:50:39,630
Marjorie's old petticoat!
You've got me in Marjorie's old petticoat!

630
00:50:39,686 --> 00:50:40,960
No one will recognize...

631
00:50:41,021 --> 00:50:43,763
Well, everybody in town will know
it's Marjorie's old petticoat.

632
00:50:43,824 --> 00:50:45,997
- You can't make me wear it.
- Oh, Wesley.

633
00:50:46,059 --> 00:50:47,902
Stop yelling, "Marjorie's old petticoat."

634
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:49,440
Do you want all the neighbors to hear it?

635
00:50:49,496 --> 00:50:52,500
Marjorie's old petticoat! I won't wear it!

636
00:50:52,566 --> 00:50:54,068
- Wait. Your wings!
- Grab him.

637
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:55,670
Close the door.

638
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:59,979
- Throw some water on him! Get him!
- I'll get him. I'll get him.

639
00:51:00,741 --> 00:51:03,415
- I'll get him! I'll get him! I got him!
- No!

640
00:51:06,913 --> 00:51:09,325
I wouldn't be an angel if you kill me.

641
00:51:09,382 --> 00:51:14,354
Wesley, you've broken your wings.
Stella, see if you can find his halo.

642
00:51:15,055 --> 00:51:17,968
Halo? How about a straightjacket?

643
00:54:08,628 --> 00:54:12,542
Now do you know the difference between
a proper and an improper fraction?

644
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:13,771
Sometimes.

645
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:17,303
Wesley, if you don't pay attention,
you'll never learn.

646
00:55:39,152 --> 00:55:42,759
Wesley Winfield,
you come down here this instant.

647
00:55:42,822 --> 00:55:44,699
You hear me?

648
00:55:45,158 --> 00:55:48,196
Come down here. Come down here right...

649
00:55:49,029 --> 00:55:51,908
If you don't come down, I'll get you down.

650
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:56,646
Wesley! Wesley. Wesley Winfield.

651
00:55:56,703 --> 00:55:58,979
Wesley. Wesley Winfield.

652
00:56:00,573 --> 00:56:02,018
Wesley Winfield!

653
00:56:02,075 --> 00:56:06,114
Oh, my goodness. Can't you keep still
for a minute, you old crow?

654
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:08,857
What did you say?

655
00:56:11,751 --> 00:56:13,389
What did you say?

656
00:56:14,687 --> 00:56:16,428
What did I say?

657
00:56:16,489 --> 00:56:20,232
You know very well what you said.
Now, stand up.

658
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:25,102
March.

659
00:56:40,747 --> 00:56:46,220
Wesley, what excuse do you have to offer
before I report your case to the principal?

660
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:49,827
Well, I was just thinking.

661
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:52,394
That won't do, Wesley Winfield.

662
00:56:52,459 --> 00:56:56,236
If that is your only excuse,
I shall report your case this instant.

663
00:56:56,296 --> 00:56:59,402
- Now, come with me.
- Well, I have got an excuse.

664
00:56:59,466 --> 00:57:01,104
Well, what is it?

665
00:57:01,734 --> 00:57:04,271
Well, it's 'cause
I didn't get any sleep last night.

666
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:05,907
Were you ill?

667
00:57:05,972 --> 00:57:09,943
No, ma'am. It wasn't illness.
It was lots worse than being sick.

668
00:57:10,777 --> 00:57:14,315
- It was... It was just awful.
- What was?

669
00:57:14,781 --> 00:57:16,818
- It's about Father.
- Your father?

670
00:57:16,883 --> 00:57:19,591
And Mother,
but the trouble was mainly Father.

671
00:57:19,652 --> 00:57:23,259
Now, Wesley, I've never heard
any such rumors about your family.

672
00:57:23,323 --> 00:57:24,961
I've heard them about plenty of others,

673
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:30,201
but, well, your father has always
struck me as a quiet and charming man.

674
00:57:30,263 --> 00:57:32,038
Well, he was until last year,

675
00:57:32,098 --> 00:57:34,305
when he took to running
with them traveling men.

676
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:38,338
What? I don't want to hear
another word of this.

677
00:57:41,474 --> 00:57:42,748
Continue.

678
00:57:43,576 --> 00:57:46,079
Yes, ma'am. That was what started it.

679
00:57:46,146 --> 00:57:48,217
At first, he was a good, kind husband,

680
00:57:48,281 --> 00:57:50,591
but those traveling men,
they coaxed him into a saloon

681
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:53,654
on his way home from work,
and they started him drinking beer,

682
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,496
and then ales, and wines,
and liquors, and cigars...

683
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:57,933
- Wesley.
- Ma'am?

684
00:57:57,991 --> 00:58:01,803
I don't want to hear any further
about your family's private affairs.

685
00:58:01,861 --> 00:58:06,139
Now, I'm asking you if you have anything
to say that could possibly excuse...

686
00:58:06,199 --> 00:58:09,976
That's just what I'm trying to tell you,
Miss Stevens, if you'd just only let me.

687
00:58:10,036 --> 00:58:13,609
- You see, after we bandaged Marjorie...
- Bandaged Marjorie?

688
00:58:13,673 --> 00:58:16,449
Yes, ma'am. You see,
her leg was all bruised up and mauled

689
00:58:16,509 --> 00:58:18,682
where he'd been hitting her with his cane.

690
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:22,215
I knew Marjorie had hurt her ankle,
but I didn't know your father had...

691
00:58:22,282 --> 00:58:24,558
Yes, ma'am. So I had to sit up with her.

692
00:58:24,617 --> 00:58:27,188
And Mother.
She had some pretty big bruises, too.

693
00:58:28,054 --> 00:58:30,796
But why didn't you send for the doctor?

694
00:58:30,857 --> 00:58:34,828
Oh, they didn't want any doctor.
We don't want anybody to hear about it.

695
00:58:34,894 --> 00:58:36,999
You see, Father might reform,
and then where would he be

696
00:58:37,063 --> 00:58:41,102
if everybody knew he'd been a drunkard
and whipped his wife and daughter?

697
00:58:41,167 --> 00:58:44,705
You see, he used to be as upright
as anyone. It all begun...

698
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,876
- "it began," Wesley.
- Yes, ma'am.

699
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,614
It all commenced from the first day
he let them traveling men

700
00:58:49,676 --> 00:58:51,519
coax him into that saloon.

701
00:58:57,283 --> 00:59:00,526
I said, "Why, Mother,
what's the use in taking on so about it?"

702
00:59:00,587 --> 00:59:03,625
And I said, "All the crying in the world
won't help matters any."

703
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:07,638
And she'd catch hold of me
and kind of sob and holler and...

704
00:59:07,694 --> 00:59:11,665
And I'd say to her, "Mother, don't cry.
Please don't cry."

705
00:59:13,233 --> 00:59:15,645
Wesley, now I understand.

706
00:59:15,735 --> 00:59:18,238
And you were thinking
of all those dreadful things so hard

707
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:20,682
that you forgot where you were.

708
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:23,186
I was thinking how to save Father.

709
00:59:24,444 --> 00:59:26,981
You brave little boy.

710
00:59:30,083 --> 00:59:32,563
I know how upset you are.

711
00:59:32,619 --> 00:59:36,965
Why don't you take the afternoon off
and forget about the whole thing?

712
00:59:37,023 --> 00:59:38,661
Thank you, ma'am.

713
00:59:40,627 --> 00:59:43,301
All right, Hubert, I'll tell him. Bye.

714
00:59:48,234 --> 00:59:50,714
That was Hubert Wakely on the phone.

715
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:52,647
The carolers are waiting for Wesley.

716
00:59:52,705 --> 00:59:53,843
Let them wait.

717
00:59:53,906 --> 00:59:56,477
I wouldn't put on that old petticoat
if you paid me.

718
00:59:56,542 --> 00:59:59,751
Well, since it's most unlikely you'd be paid
for such a performance,

719
00:59:59,812 --> 01:00:02,349
you'll go to bed right after dinner.

720
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,685
Eat your soup. it's good.

721
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:11,301
Marjorie, have you talked
to Mary Stevens lately?

722
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:12,563
You mean Wesley's teacher?

723
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:16,266
Yes. Do you think
she's a little queer these days?

724
01:00:16,829 --> 01:00:18,968
No. What makes you say that?

725
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:23,378
Well, she's acquired a very odd manner.
At least, she seemed odd to me.

726
01:00:23,436 --> 01:00:24,938
I met her in the store this afternoon,

727
01:00:25,004 --> 01:00:26,984
and after we'd said,
"How do you do?" to each other,

728
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,111
she kept hold of my hand

729
01:00:29,175 --> 01:00:32,019
and looked as though
she were going to cry.

730
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:36,420
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

731
01:00:38,785 --> 01:00:42,528
I don't think it's so odd, Mother.
I think she's just very emotional.

732
01:00:42,588 --> 01:00:44,295
You know,
she has relations living in England

733
01:00:44,357 --> 01:00:45,529
and what with the war and everything
going on...

734
01:00:45,591 --> 01:00:49,562
Wait. She stood there squeezing my hand
and struggling to get her voice.

735
01:00:49,629 --> 01:00:51,131
Really, I was embarrassed.

736
01:00:51,197 --> 01:00:54,770
And then finally she said,
in a kind of a tearful whisper,

737
01:00:54,834 --> 01:00:58,281
"Be of good cheer. This trial will pass."

738
01:00:58,338 --> 01:01:01,080
- How queer.
- Maybe she'd been drinking.

739
01:01:04,811 --> 01:01:08,258
Wait. After that,
she said something even queerer

740
01:01:08,314 --> 01:01:11,761
and put her handkerchief to her eyes
and hurried away.

741
01:01:11,818 --> 01:01:14,389
Well? What was the other thing she said?

742
01:01:14,687 --> 01:01:19,295
She said, "l know that Wesley is a great,
great comfort to you."

743
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:24,931
- I'm afraid she's a goner.
- Crazy as a bedbug.

744
01:01:24,997 --> 01:01:29,241
- Did she say anything else?
- No, that's all she said. Every word.

745
01:01:31,637 --> 01:01:33,548
Stella, more soup.

746
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:44,094
- William Sherman!
- How do you do, Miss Stevens?

747
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:46,027
Well, what are you doing in town?

748
01:01:46,085 --> 01:01:48,691
Jim said you were staying
at the university this Christmas.

749
01:01:48,755 --> 01:01:52,897
Well, I came down to take Marjorie
to the charity ball. it's a surprise.

750
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,405
- Marjorie Winfield?
- Yes.

751
01:01:55,461 --> 01:02:00,376
- You poor, poor boy.
- What's the matter, Miss Stevens?

752
01:02:00,433 --> 01:02:03,812
You mean she didn't write you
about her father?

753
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:05,907
No. What about her father?

754
01:02:07,874 --> 01:02:10,582
You come with me. Come on. Come on.

755
01:02:16,916 --> 01:02:18,259
Stella, that's cold.

756
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:22,561
Nothing like an alcohol rub.
Keeps the circulation going.

757
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:24,093
George.

758
01:02:24,924 --> 01:02:25,925
George!

759
01:02:27,093 --> 01:02:29,130
He's sleeping like a baby.

760
01:02:29,595 --> 01:02:34,203
- He's been Working too hard lately.
- ls the light shining in his eyes, Mother?

761
01:02:34,267 --> 01:02:37,043
Oh? Oh, I'll fix that.

762
01:02:42,775 --> 01:02:46,552
Isn't this cozy? A perfect Christmas Eve.

763
01:02:48,381 --> 01:02:50,088
Somebody wants in.

764
01:02:55,721 --> 01:02:58,099
Merry Christmas.

765
01:02:58,157 --> 01:03:00,068
- Marjorie!
- Bill!

766
01:03:01,894 --> 01:03:04,738
Oh, Bill, I'm so glad to see you.

767
01:03:05,631 --> 01:03:06,905
- It's true.
- What?

768
01:03:06,966 --> 01:03:09,674
Look what he's done to you. That monster.

769
01:03:09,735 --> 01:03:09,907
Who?

770
01:03:09,908 --> 01:03:11,840
Marjorie, I'll take
you away from all this.

771
01:03:11,904 --> 01:03:13,781
William, will you please be quiet?

772
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:17,185
Don't you worry, Mrs. Winfield.
I'm not afraid of him.

773
01:03:17,243 --> 01:03:18,278
William!

774
01:03:18,344 --> 01:03:21,086
So this is what the institution
of marriage has done.

775
01:03:21,147 --> 01:03:23,127
Forced you to live
with that drunken beast.

776
01:03:23,182 --> 01:03:24,286
What?

777
01:03:25,785 --> 01:03:28,629
Why, this place reeks with alcohol.

778
01:03:28,688 --> 01:03:30,861
That's rubbing alcohol.

779
01:03:32,425 --> 01:03:36,168
Oh, no. How low can a man sink?

780
01:03:38,698 --> 01:03:40,143
What's the matter with you?

781
01:03:40,199 --> 01:03:42,873
Look at him.
Lying there in a drunken stupor.

782
01:03:42,935 --> 01:03:45,142
- I'll sober him up.
- William, no!

783
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:51,120
And if you ever lay a little finger
on either of them again, I'll...

784
01:03:51,177 --> 01:03:53,521
- What finger? Take your hands off of me!
- Have you gone crazy?

785
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:56,025
- You don't deserve a family like this!
- How did he get in here?

786
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:59,689
- Get him out of here!
- Are you out of your mind?

787
01:03:59,785 --> 01:04:02,493
- Stella? Stella?
- Get this madman out of this house.

788
01:04:02,555 --> 01:04:05,229
William Sherman, I never want to
see you again as long as I live.

789
01:04:05,291 --> 01:04:08,272
I'm sorry, Marjie, but they said
he'd taken to drink and was beating you.

790
01:04:08,327 --> 01:04:09,397
Who's they?

791
01:04:09,462 --> 01:04:12,033
Miss Stevens, Wesley's teacher.
I met her at the station.

792
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:14,271
How could you believe
for one minute that my father...

793
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:16,836
Young man,
never step foot inside this door again.

794
01:04:16,903 --> 01:04:19,543
But, sir, she said that Wesley said that...

795
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:23,212
I knew it was a mistake
moving into this neighborhood.

796
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:25,779
Papa, I've never seen him like this before.

797
01:04:25,845 --> 01:04:26,949
Maybe, he's been studying too hard.

798
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,850
His mind must have snapped.

799
01:04:28,915 --> 01:04:31,862
What was that he was saying
about Mr. Wesley?

800
01:04:33,352 --> 01:04:34,797
Wesley!

801
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:37,457
Oh, my goodness.

802
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:42,796
William! William!

803
01:04:43,663 --> 01:04:45,040
- William!
- Wesley?

804
01:04:47,333 --> 01:04:48,539
Wesley.

805
01:04:51,671 --> 01:04:53,480
Oh, William, I'm awfully sorry.

806
01:04:53,539 --> 01:04:56,349
If only I had told you
how I sprained my ankle.

807
01:04:56,409 --> 01:04:59,447
- I'm not interested.
- William, please listen to me.

808
01:04:59,512 --> 01:05:03,517
I was throwing snowballs and I fell,
and I didn't want to tell you because...

809
01:05:03,583 --> 01:05:05,893
'Cause you think I'm so feminine.

810
01:05:06,519 --> 01:05:09,159
There's nothing I wanted more
than to go to the dance with you.

811
01:05:09,221 --> 01:05:12,964
I even practiced the grizzly bear
and the crab step and all those dances.

812
01:05:13,025 --> 01:05:15,266
Won't you please come back?

813
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:18,138
I only make a fool of myself once a night.

814
01:05:19,732 --> 01:05:21,734
Why, you pompous old...

815
01:05:35,147 --> 01:05:38,390
Well, your little son is not in his room
or anyplace else in the house.

816
01:05:38,451 --> 01:05:40,590
- I hope he's all right.
- So do I,

817
01:05:40,653 --> 01:05:44,430
because I want him to be in
good condition when I catch up with him.

818
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:45,730
Wesley.

819
01:05:46,659 --> 01:05:47,763
Wesley!

820
01:06:18,457 --> 01:06:21,802
Mother, I need a drink.

821
01:06:21,861 --> 01:06:23,636
I'll have one with you.

822
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:51,080
- Merry Christmas, Marjorie.
- Merry Christmas, Bill.

823
01:09:16,468 --> 01:09:21,281
You know, it just occurred to me that,
after today, I won't belong here anymore.

824
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:25,618
Why, William Sherman, I didn't know
that college meant so much to you.

825
01:09:26,145 --> 01:09:28,887
You used to laugh at it, you know.

826
01:09:28,948 --> 01:09:31,588
I was just going through a phase.

827
01:09:33,219 --> 01:09:35,221
Were you going through one
about me, too?

828
01:09:35,287 --> 01:09:37,893
No, that wasn't a phase.

829
01:09:39,658 --> 01:09:43,367
Oh, Bill, we're going to have
a wonderful time this summer.

830
01:09:45,197 --> 01:09:46,676
What's wrong?

831
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:51,779
Marjie, there's something very important
I've got to tell you.

832
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:53,717
What's wrong?

833
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:56,052
Come on, Bill.
You want to graduate, don't you?

834
01:09:56,108 --> 01:09:58,281
Or do you want to wait till next year?

835
01:09:58,344 --> 01:10:00,449
Holy smokes, I've got to make a speech.
Come on.

836
01:10:00,512 --> 01:10:03,686
- But what were you going to tell me?
- You'll know soon enough.

837
01:10:03,749 --> 01:10:06,286
During our four years at college,

838
01:10:06,352 --> 01:10:10,630
many of us have changed our ideas
as often as our wardrobes,

839
01:10:10,689 --> 01:10:12,862
and I think it's a wise thing.

840
01:10:13,525 --> 01:10:17,632
A good student
should have an open and inquiring mind.

841
01:10:18,597 --> 01:10:24,309
As freshmen, we were radicals.
As sophomores, we were freethinkers.

842
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:28,376
As juniors, we were intellectuals.

843
01:10:29,608 --> 01:10:31,485
In those years past,

844
01:10:31,543 --> 01:10:35,719
it had become fashionable for us
to sneer at established institutions.

845
01:10:36,615 --> 01:10:40,062
But now,
we must outgrow our callow philosophies

846
01:10:40,119 --> 01:10:43,157
and face the realities
of a troubled and changing world.

847
01:10:43,222 --> 01:10:46,965
Doesn't William look distinguished
in his cap and gown?

848
01:10:47,026 --> 01:10:50,200
Someday, Wesley will look
just as distinguished.

849
01:10:50,262 --> 01:10:52,902
Yeah, but it'll take more
than a cap and gown.

850
01:10:52,965 --> 01:10:54,876
I say to you that we must awaken

851
01:10:54,934 --> 01:10:56,379
to our responsibilities

852
01:10:58,203 --> 01:11:00,046
as students and citizens,

853
01:11:00,472 --> 01:11:03,351
and remember
that we are men and women,

854
01:11:03,442 --> 01:11:05,922
not dreamers in an ivory tower.

855
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:12,352
"These are the times
that try men's souls."

856
01:11:12,418 --> 01:11:14,864
The summer soldier
and the sunshine patriot

857
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:16,831
must do everything in their power.

858
01:11:16,889 --> 01:11:20,962
Well, we are not summer soldiers
or sunshine patriots.

859
01:11:21,327 --> 01:11:24,137
Many of you
have come to think of college students

860
01:11:24,196 --> 01:11:26,301
as frivolous young men and women.

861
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:30,745
A fine boy. A little erratic,
but he's straightening out.

862
01:11:31,503 --> 01:11:35,110
Now that he's graduating,
I suppose you've made your plans.

863
01:11:35,174 --> 01:11:37,085
Plans for what, Father?

864
01:11:37,176 --> 01:11:41,818
- Well, marriage. What else is there?
- Bill doesn't believe in marriage.

865
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,791
Something else
they've taught him at college,

866
01:11:43,849 --> 01:11:45,226
but you'll bring him around.

867
01:11:45,284 --> 01:11:48,060
- He's convinced me that he's right.
- What?

868
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:50,930
...are also mature enough
to recognize our responsibility...

869
01:11:50,990 --> 01:11:54,301
Bill says that marriage
is a remnant of a decadent civilization.

870
01:11:54,493 --> 01:11:57,372
Well, this decadent family has...

871
01:11:57,429 --> 01:11:59,272
Has believed in it for a good many years,

872
01:11:59,331 --> 01:12:01,709
and I've never seen any cause
to regret it until today.

873
01:12:01,767 --> 01:12:04,509
I am taking you away from him
before it's too late.

874
01:12:05,471 --> 01:12:09,078
...recognize our responsibility
to our generation.

875
01:12:10,142 --> 01:12:14,113
It may come as a surprise to many
and a shock to some,

876
01:12:14,179 --> 01:12:16,216
but we realized
individually and collectively

877
01:12:16,281 --> 01:12:19,490
that we had no other course
but to face reality

878
01:12:19,551 --> 01:12:21,588
and our duty to our country.

879
01:12:21,653 --> 01:12:25,191
I am very proud
to be a member of this graduating class.

880
01:12:45,978 --> 01:12:47,184
Bill.

881
01:13:07,733 --> 01:13:09,735
I told you it was too hot for soup.

882
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:13,045
Why, at least you'd think
it would cool off in the evening.

883
01:13:13,105 --> 01:13:15,107
George, why don't you take off
your jacket?

884
01:13:15,174 --> 01:13:19,452
I think I will.
It seems to be getting warmer every year.

885
01:13:25,717 --> 01:13:26,957
It's 7:30.

886
01:13:27,586 --> 01:13:29,964
She's probably
mooning around somewhere.

887
01:13:30,222 --> 01:13:32,668
She has been since you-know-What.

888
01:13:33,292 --> 01:13:36,865
Someday, Marjorie's going to thank me
for what I've done.

889
01:13:37,296 --> 01:13:39,207
I was talking to Hubert Wakely.

890
01:13:39,264 --> 01:13:41,369
She doesn't like him, George.

891
01:13:41,433 --> 01:13:43,310
And Why not? I'd like to know.

892
01:13:43,368 --> 01:13:45,780
He's reliable, settled, makes a good living,

893
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:48,375
and he won't have to go into the Army.

894
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:51,177
This morning he told me
he had a punctured eardrum.

895
01:13:51,243 --> 01:13:53,245
I punctured it last night.

896
01:13:53,312 --> 01:13:54,518
Stella.

897
01:13:57,616 --> 01:14:00,597
Hey, Wesley! Wesley!

898
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,127
- You coming?
- Be right there.

899
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:07,700
- Mom, I'm not hungry. Can I go with Jim?
- Where you going, dear?

900
01:14:07,759 --> 01:14:08,999
Well, there's a troop train coming in,

901
01:14:09,061 --> 01:14:10,665
and we thought we'd go down
to the station

902
01:14:10,729 --> 01:14:11,901
'cause Bill's going to be on it.

903
01:14:11,964 --> 01:14:15,104
Sit down and eat your dinner, young man.
You're not going anywhere.

904
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:18,239
Seems to me if Marjie can go,
I ought to be able to.

905
01:14:18,303 --> 01:14:20,613
Marjie knows better
than to do anything like that.

906
01:14:20,672 --> 01:14:21,946
Well, she was packing her bag.

907
01:14:22,007 --> 01:14:24,180
And when I asked her
where she was going, she said...

908
01:14:24,243 --> 01:14:27,122
Packing her bag? George!

909
01:14:28,347 --> 01:14:31,692
Well! I'll take care of this.

910
01:14:40,125 --> 01:14:44,073
Well, it's a little too hot for dessert,
wasn't it?

911
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:27,344
Hey! What are they handing out
on this side of the train?

912
01:15:27,406 --> 01:15:29,443
You gotta help me get on.

913
01:15:29,508 --> 01:15:32,045
Wouldn't it be simpler if I got off?

914
01:15:32,511 --> 01:15:34,821
Please. I'm looking for a soldier.

915
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:38,089
- You came to the right store.
- Thanks.

916
01:15:38,150 --> 01:15:40,960
Hey, how do I know
you're not a German spy?

917
01:15:41,019 --> 01:15:42,054
I'm not.

918
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,726
Well, maybe I'd better search you
for secret papers.

919
01:16:01,473 --> 01:16:04,943
Hey, Joe, wait till I tell you
about the dream I just had.

920
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:28,307
Bill!

921
01:16:37,075 --> 01:16:40,648
- Marjorie! What are you doing here?
- I'm going with you.

922
01:16:41,113 --> 01:16:42,251
But this is a troop train.

923
01:16:42,314 --> 01:16:45,557
I don't care what it is or where it's going,
just so we can be together.

924
01:16:45,617 --> 01:16:48,496
It's going to be mighty crowded
in that pup tent.

925
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:51,994
We're pulling out any minute.
You've got to get off.

926
01:16:52,057 --> 01:16:53,661
I'm not leaving you.

927
01:16:53,725 --> 01:16:56,865
Until you ship out, I'm never going to be
any farther away from you than this.

928
01:16:56,928 --> 01:17:01,070
Hey, maybe this is that bonus
that Congress has been promising us.

929
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,641
You've got to get out of here.

930
01:17:04,603 --> 01:17:07,083
Say, Bill, see if she's got a friend,
will you, kid?

931
01:17:07,406 --> 01:17:10,114
That's the way I figure.
Got it all figured out. You get off...

932
01:17:10,175 --> 01:17:12,917
But I may never see you again,
and if there's any way that I can...

933
01:17:12,978 --> 01:17:14,252
Young lady, will you listen to me?

934
01:17:14,313 --> 01:17:15,792
Please, William, I know what I'm doing.

935
01:17:15,847 --> 01:17:18,293
- I've thought about this for a long...
- Will you marry me?

936
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:20,227
I can get a place to stay
near the camp and...

937
01:17:20,285 --> 01:17:22,492
I'm asking you to be my wife.

938
01:17:24,122 --> 01:17:27,296
Your married wife? Oh, Bill.

939
01:17:28,293 --> 01:17:29,670
Oh, Bill.

940
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:33,332
But you don't believe in marriage.

941
01:17:33,398 --> 01:17:36,607
Right this minute,
I don't know anything I believe in more.

942
01:17:37,169 --> 01:17:41,709
Now, look, Marjie, you get the next train.
I'll meet you in Chicago.

943
01:17:41,773 --> 01:17:44,583
We'll be married as soon as you get there.

944
01:17:46,712 --> 01:17:49,358
Marjorie Winfield, you
get off of this train.

945
01:17:49,359 --> 01:17:49,818
Father.

946
01:17:49,881 --> 01:17:52,361
And, as for you, young man,
I ought to have you thrown in prison.

947
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:54,397
- Oh, Father...
- But, Mr. Winfield...

948
01:17:54,453 --> 01:17:57,229
But, Mr. Winfield,
I just asked Marjie to marry me.

949
01:17:57,289 --> 01:18:01,499
Yes, I expected you to say that.
Now, you're coming home to grow up.

950
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:04,836
- But Father!
- Running away with a soldier.

951
01:18:04,896 --> 01:18:08,776
How you could let him influence you
into doing such a thing.

952
01:18:08,834 --> 01:18:12,907
- But it was all my idea.
- Why didn't you stick to baseball?

953
01:18:22,147 --> 01:18:23,353
Marjie?

954
01:18:29,488 --> 01:18:30,694
Marjie?

955
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:35,370
Yes, Wesley?

956
01:18:37,896 --> 01:18:39,273
I'm sorry.

957
01:18:39,865 --> 01:18:42,277
It was a secret
about you going to the train,

958
01:18:42,701 --> 01:18:43,702
and I told.

959
01:18:45,337 --> 01:18:47,817
- it's all right.
- Well, no, it isn't.

960
01:18:47,873 --> 01:18:52,253
I'm going to be 12 years old tomorrow,
and I'm acting like I was a child.

961
01:18:53,912 --> 01:18:57,086
We all act like we're children
sometimes, Wesley.

962
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:04,166
Gee, it must be tough being a girl.

963
01:19:27,712 --> 01:19:29,885
- Hello, Miss Robertson.
- Hello, Stella.

964
01:19:29,948 --> 01:19:32,292
Well, it's good to see you.
Here, let me help you.

965
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:34,125
If I needed any help, I wouldn't have come.

966
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:35,597
Aunt Martha.

967
01:19:37,789 --> 01:19:39,996
Wesley, Aunt Martha's here!

968
01:19:41,326 --> 01:19:45,775
It's good to see you.
You're looking younger every day.

969
01:19:45,831 --> 01:19:48,072
Well, I feel younger every day.

970
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:53,849
- Hello, Aunt Martha.
- Wesley! My, how you've grown.

971
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:58,619
Why, I hardly know you with your face
all washed and your hair combed.

972
01:19:58,677 --> 01:19:59,849
Yes, ma'am.

973
01:20:02,714 --> 01:20:06,218
- Well, can't we all go inside?
- No, I'll only stay a few minutes.

974
01:20:06,284 --> 01:20:10,130
I just came to bring Wesley some cookies
and give him his birthday present.

975
01:20:10,188 --> 01:20:12,532
I guess that's all you're interested in,
isn't it, Wesley?

976
01:20:12,591 --> 01:20:13,763
Yes, ma'am.

977
01:20:17,562 --> 01:20:21,237
Well, I hear that George really made
a spectacle of himself last night

978
01:20:21,299 --> 01:20:22,903
at the railway station.

979
01:20:23,902 --> 01:20:27,975
Oh, shush yourself, Alice.
One prude in the family is enough.

980
01:20:28,039 --> 01:20:31,111
Marjorie wants to get married.
Why doesn't he let her?

981
01:20:31,176 --> 01:20:33,747
Well, George feels the boy isn't sincere.

982
01:20:33,812 --> 01:20:36,793
You see, William doesn't believe
in the institution of marriage.

983
01:20:36,848 --> 01:20:38,020
Fiddlesticks.

984
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:42,327
No man believes in marriage,
until a woman traps him into it.

985
01:20:42,387 --> 01:20:44,628
Remember how you got George?

986
01:20:45,857 --> 01:20:49,031
- Well, Wesley, how you making out?
- Just fine.

987
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:52,598
- Happy birthday.
- Gee, thanks, Aunt Martha.

988
01:21:13,652 --> 01:21:16,189
Oh, no, Aunt Martha, not that.

989
01:21:16,254 --> 01:21:18,291
Oh, let him keep it.

990
01:21:18,356 --> 01:21:20,927
I suppose he will do
something horrible with it.

991
01:21:20,992 --> 01:21:25,099
- I'd be disappointed if he didn't.
- Wesley, be careful. You'll cut yourself.

992
01:21:25,163 --> 01:21:28,542
- And here's something else.
- Gee, thanks again.

993
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:31,080
That isn't for you,
but go ahead and open it.

994
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:34,743
I want you to give it back to your father.
I think it's time.

995
01:21:34,806 --> 01:21:39,721
You tell him I sent it to him because
I believe I can trust him with it now.

996
01:21:42,547 --> 01:21:47,121
I took that contraption
away from your father 35 years ago,

997
01:21:47,185 --> 01:21:50,997
one day after he'd killed
my best hen with it, accidentally.

998
01:21:51,056 --> 01:21:52,091
Father?

999
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:55,536
I think, if you give him that from me,
he'll remember.

1000
01:21:56,027 --> 01:22:01,101
You look like your father, Wesley.
He was anything but a handsome boy.

1001
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:03,612
He'll grow out of it, Aunt Martha.

1002
01:22:05,604 --> 01:22:09,177
There's one more cookie left.
Aren't you going to eat it?

1003
01:22:09,808 --> 01:22:11,913
Well, I guess, I'd better.

1004
01:22:11,977 --> 01:22:15,754
Go ahead and stuff yourself.
You're 12 years old today

1005
01:22:15,814 --> 01:22:17,987
and you ought to be happy,
if you're nothing else.

1006
01:22:18,049 --> 01:22:21,656
It's taken over 1,900 years of Christianity

1007
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:26,362
and some hundreds of thousands of years
of other things to produce you,

1008
01:22:26,424 --> 01:22:28,267
and there you sit.

1009
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:30,330
Ma'am?

1010
01:22:30,395 --> 01:22:32,875
It'll be your turn
to struggle and muss things up

1011
01:22:32,931 --> 01:22:35,275
for the betterment
of posterity soon enough.

1012
01:22:35,333 --> 01:22:36,368
Eat your cookie.

1013
01:22:36,701 --> 01:22:38,305
Yes, ma'am.

1014
01:22:53,918 --> 01:22:55,989
- Stella.
- Behind you.

1015
01:22:57,188 --> 01:23:00,795
We're not ready for the cake yet.
Mr. Wakely's still singing.

1016
01:23:00,892 --> 01:23:03,395
Thought if I took it in, he'd stop.

1017
01:23:53,912 --> 01:23:55,448
Thank you. Thank you.

1018
01:23:55,513 --> 01:23:59,984
I know you would like me to go on and on,
but I really must stop.

1019
01:24:00,051 --> 01:24:03,498
And now, if the little gentlemen
will take the little ladies by the hand,

1020
01:24:03,555 --> 01:24:08,300
we shall put a record on the phonograph
and you may all trip the light fantastic.

1021
01:24:23,408 --> 01:24:27,652
Wesley, why are you sitting here?
Why aren't you dancing?

1022
01:24:27,712 --> 01:24:30,716
I don't want to dance.
it's my birthday, so I don't have to.

1023
01:24:30,782 --> 01:24:31,886
Wesley.

1024
01:24:31,950 --> 01:24:34,863
Well, whose party is this?
Hubert Wakely's or mine?

1025
01:24:34,919 --> 01:24:36,330
Why, it's yours, dear.

1026
01:24:36,387 --> 01:24:39,391
Well, then why doesn't he stop singing
and go home?

1027
01:24:40,024 --> 01:24:43,267
- May I have this dance?
- No, thank you, Hubert. Really, I...

1028
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:46,309
Oh, come, come now,
this is no time to be coy.

1029
01:24:46,364 --> 01:24:48,970
Look, he's trying
to make Marjie dance with him.

1030
01:24:49,033 --> 01:24:50,944
Why doesn't he leave her alone?

1031
01:24:51,002 --> 01:24:52,845
Don't worry about it.

1032
01:24:52,904 --> 01:24:55,441
Your father and I had along talk last night,

1033
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:58,613
and, with your approval,
it's full steam ahead.

1034
01:25:00,078 --> 01:25:03,287
Excuse me,
but Marjorie promised this dance to me.

1035
01:25:04,783 --> 01:25:06,456
- I did?
- Sure.

1036
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:10,762
Guess I can dance with my own sister
at my own birthday party, can't I?

1037
01:25:11,222 --> 01:25:12,997
But, princess...

1038
01:25:15,226 --> 01:25:18,298
Well, I guess I can dance
with my own brother.

1039
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:20,502
Would you excuse us, Hubert?

1040
01:25:49,761 --> 01:25:51,297
Stella, you should be more careful.

1041
01:25:51,729 --> 01:25:53,106
Careful.

1042
01:25:54,365 --> 01:25:57,972
Well, it looks like
I'm not such a bad father after all.

1043
01:25:58,036 --> 01:26:00,209
Wesley's behaving
like a perfect little gentleman.

1044
01:26:00,271 --> 01:26:02,979
Even Marjorie seems to be
enjoying herself.

1045
01:26:03,041 --> 01:26:04,816
Everything is calm once more.

1046
01:26:04,876 --> 01:26:06,480
Cyclone weather.

1047
01:26:07,078 --> 01:26:10,150
Stella, answer that.
I hope it's the ice cream.

1048
01:26:11,182 --> 01:26:12,183
Pretty.

1049
01:26:15,119 --> 01:26:17,030
It ain't the ice cream.

1050
01:26:18,656 --> 01:26:22,001
- Come right in.
- Mr. Winfield, I've got to talk to you.

1051
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:24,939
I thought we were well rid of you.

1052
01:26:24,996 --> 01:26:26,270
I have a 24-hour pass,

1053
01:26:26,331 --> 01:26:28,743
and the only train back
leaves in a half an hour.

1054
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:31,246
Sir, I'm in love with your daughter
and I want to marry her.

1055
01:26:31,302 --> 01:26:35,682
And how long would that last?
Until you get some other crackpot ideas?

1056
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:38,349
- Bill.
- Marjorie.

1057
01:26:39,077 --> 01:26:41,819
Hold me tight. Don't let me go this time.

1058
01:26:42,814 --> 01:26:46,455
I don't want to. But it's up to your father.

1059
01:26:47,218 --> 01:26:49,528
You're making it very difficult for me,
young man,

1060
01:26:49,587 --> 01:26:53,125
but I am sure in the long run
you'll realize I'm right.

1061
01:26:53,224 --> 01:26:56,171
- Now, I'll thank you to leave my house.
- George.

1062
01:26:56,227 --> 01:26:58,298
Father, Bill and I
are going to be married right now,

1063
01:26:58,363 --> 01:27:01,003
and you couldn't stop us
with an act of Congress.

1064
01:27:01,065 --> 01:27:02,373
I'll get my things.

1065
01:27:02,433 --> 01:27:06,108
Wait a minute, Marjorie.
Let's be sensible about this.

1066
01:27:08,239 --> 01:27:09,809
I couldn't ask you to give up your family

1067
01:27:09,874 --> 01:27:12,753
for one Week
with a soldier who's shipping out.

1068
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:14,312
It wouldn't be fair to you.

1069
01:27:14,379 --> 01:27:16,916
But how can you be sensible
at a time like this?

1070
01:27:16,981 --> 01:27:20,895
One of us has to be.
It may be along time before I get back.

1071
01:27:21,853 --> 01:27:24,857
You're gonna have to live with them,
not with me.

1072
01:27:26,424 --> 01:27:28,665
Sol guess we'd better wait.

1073
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:35,945
- ls it all right if I walk him to the gate?
- Certainly you can, darling.

1074
01:27:36,401 --> 01:27:38,176
You go right ahead.

1075
01:27:41,973 --> 01:27:44,351
Sometimes I don't understand you.

1076
01:27:44,409 --> 01:27:47,879
Well, what did you want me to do?
Let my daughter become a camp follower?

1077
01:27:47,946 --> 01:27:50,483
George Wadsworth Winfield,
you listen to me.

1078
01:27:51,182 --> 01:27:53,184
And I'll Write you every day I'm gone.

1079
01:27:53,251 --> 01:27:58,428
And I'll knit you some socks.
I can't knit, but I'll knit you some socks.

1080
01:27:58,990 --> 01:28:02,403
Well, if I can get my shoes on over them,
I'll wear them.

1081
01:28:03,394 --> 01:28:08,036
I know I'm supposed to be brave, William,
but you're gonna be so far away.

1082
01:28:08,099 --> 01:28:10,943
Oh, come on, it's not as bad as all that.

1083
01:28:11,002 --> 01:28:13,608
You know the song
all the doughboys are singing.

1084
01:28:13,671 --> 01:28:17,813
- "Smile the while I kiss you fond adieu."
- "Sad adieu."

1085
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:20,685
- "When the clouds roll by..."
- "I'll come to you."

1086
01:30:09,754 --> 01:30:10,960
Marjie?

1087
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:17,503
Don't take it so seriously.
She'll get over it.

1088
01:30:19,564 --> 01:30:23,637
George, were you ever a young man?
I can't even remember.

1089
01:30:23,701 --> 01:30:24,736
Alice!

1090
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:38,024
After all,
no man really wants to get married.

1091
01:30:38,082 --> 01:30:40,722
William is just more honest than most.

1092
01:30:41,185 --> 01:30:43,631
Now, I suppose
I didn't want to get married to you.

1093
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:44,792
Of course you didn't.

1094
01:30:44,856 --> 01:30:49,066
If you had any idea of the lengths
I had to go to force you to propose...

1095
01:30:51,963 --> 01:30:53,874
What do you mean?

1096
01:30:54,565 --> 01:30:57,375
You know, it's hard to realize

1097
01:30:57,435 --> 01:31:00,541
you once were exactly
like William Sherman.

1098
01:31:00,605 --> 01:31:02,414
I was not.

1099
01:31:02,473 --> 01:31:07,183
Oh, George.
You remember the day we got engaged?

1100
01:31:07,245 --> 01:31:11,853
You took me for a walk in the woods
near Aunt Martha's farm. We got lost.

1101
01:31:11,916 --> 01:31:16,831
It was hours before we got back.
You knew the way home all the time.

1102
01:31:17,255 --> 01:31:19,166
How can you say such a thing?

1103
01:31:19,490 --> 01:31:21,527
Because I knew it, too.

1104
01:31:22,293 --> 01:31:24,705
I don't recall the incident at all.

1105
01:31:24,762 --> 01:31:26,173
Of course you don't.

1106
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:28,603
Because you refuse to remember anything

1107
01:31:28,666 --> 01:31:31,647
that indicates
you might have human failings.

1108
01:31:32,670 --> 01:31:35,173
But they're the reasons I married you.

1109
01:31:47,818 --> 01:31:49,126
Wesley!

1110
01:31:51,556 --> 01:31:55,060
See what you did to that window?
You incorrigible brat.

1111
01:31:55,126 --> 01:31:57,936
I don't know what we're going to do
with you. What do you mean?

1112
01:31:57,995 --> 01:32:01,374
Just 10 minutes ago, I was telling
your mother how proud I was of you,

1113
01:32:01,432 --> 01:32:03,639
and you had to go throw a rock at me
through the window.

1114
01:32:03,701 --> 01:32:06,648
I didn't. I was shooting at a bird, and,

1115
01:32:06,704 --> 01:32:09,116
well, the sun got in my eyes
and the sling broke.

1116
01:32:09,173 --> 01:32:10,584
What sling?

1117
01:32:11,509 --> 01:32:12,817
This one.

1118
01:32:13,544 --> 01:32:16,684
Where did you get this devilish thing?
Haven't I told you a thousand times...

1119
01:32:16,747 --> 01:32:18,727
It isn't mine. it's yours.

1120
01:32:18,783 --> 01:32:20,922
- What?
- Yes, sir.

1121
01:32:20,985 --> 01:32:24,956
Aunt Martha gave it to me.
She told me to give it back to you.

1122
01:32:25,423 --> 01:32:28,768
She said she took it away from you
35 years ago.

1123
01:32:28,826 --> 01:32:31,807
You killed her best hen with it, she said.

1124
01:32:31,862 --> 01:32:34,604
She told me some more to tell you,
but I forgot.

1125
01:32:36,434 --> 01:32:37,640
Sorry, Pop.

1126
01:32:40,671 --> 01:32:43,811
It's all right, Son. Forget all about it.

1127
01:32:44,308 --> 01:32:46,948
A broken window
isn't too important, anyway.

1128
01:33:28,185 --> 01:33:30,131
Hello, operator?

1129
01:33:30,187 --> 01:33:34,192
Would you please get me the Shermans
in the 400 block on Elm Street?

1130
01:33:35,192 --> 01:33:36,193
Thank you.

1131
01:33:42,466 --> 01:33:44,002
Hello. Is Bill there?

1132
01:33:45,303 --> 01:33:47,146
Tell him it's the neighbor across the street

1133
01:33:47,204 --> 01:33:50,117
who just remembered
he was young once, too.

1134
01:34:14,565 --> 01:34:16,135
Here's your hat.

1135
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:19,272
Keep your head up
and breathe through your nose.

1136
01:34:53,604 --> 01:34:54,605
English
