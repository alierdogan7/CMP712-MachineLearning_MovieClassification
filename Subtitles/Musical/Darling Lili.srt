passing the information

00:59:58,663 --> 01:00:00,364
Get these men off me!

734
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:07,805
- It happens.
- He's drunk.

735
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:09,640
- Always is.
- Even when he flies?

736
01:00:09,674 --> 01:00:11,241
- Always is.
- I don't believe you.

737
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:12,409
- Really?
- Yeah.

738
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,378
But then why does he drink?

739
01:00:14,411 --> 01:00:15,980
Because he's afraid to fly.

740
01:00:16,013 --> 01:00:17,882
Then why does he fly?

741
01:00:17,915 --> 01:00:20,217
Because he likes to drink.

742
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:23,020
Well, sooner or later he's bound
to get himself killed.

743
01:00:23,053 --> 01:00:24,989
Sooner or later, he probably will.

744
01:00:25,022 --> 01:00:27,391
Meanwhile, he has seven planes
to his credit.

745
01:00:27,424 --> 01:00:30,728
- What? You're not serious.
- Ha-ha, I certainly am.

746
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:34,999
You mean he shot down
seven German planes?

747
01:00:35,032 --> 01:00:36,901
No, he shot down seven French planes.

748
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:38,235
What?

749
01:00:38,268 --> 01:00:40,304
Well, actually, he only shot down one.

750
01:00:40,337 --> 01:00:42,106
The rest he just wrecked.

751
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:44,208
And when you consider
he's only been at the front

752
01:00:44,241 --> 01:00:45,910
for about six months,

753
01:00:45,943 --> 01:00:47,444
it's an incredible record.
[Chuckling]

754
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,313
(Lili)
And you're an incredible liar.

755
01:00:49,346 --> 01:00:51,448
My word of honor.
As of last Friday,

756
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,050
Lieutenant Twombly-Crouch was tied

757
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:54,919
with Von Richthofen
for the championship.

758
01:00:54,952 --> 01:00:56,053
I still don't believe you.

759
01:00:56,086 --> 01:00:57,287
Neither does anybody else.

760
01:00:57,321 --> 01:00:58,789
That's what keeps old T.C. flying,

761
01:00:58,823 --> 01:01:01,926
or crashing, as the case may be.

762
01:01:01,959 --> 01:01:05,730
Nobody believes it,
including his squadron commander.

763
01:01:05,763 --> 01:01:06,964
- And who's that?
- Me.

764
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:08,799
Oh.

765
01:01:17,908 --> 01:01:23,180
What was all that talk about top-secret
missions and Crepe Suzette?

766
01:01:23,213 --> 01:01:24,882
- Just talk.
- Mmm-hmm?

767
01:01:24,915 --> 01:01:27,151
You know, I think
you're some kind of a spy.

768
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:29,754
If I told you I was?

769
01:01:29,787 --> 01:01:31,488
I know lots of military secrets.

770
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,724
Good.

771
01:01:33,758 --> 01:01:36,260
Back in a minute to pry them out of you.

772
01:01:49,139 --> 01:01:50,374
Crepe Suzette.

773
01:01:50,407 --> 01:01:51,942
What?

774
01:01:51,976 --> 01:01:53,143
That's exactly what he said.

775
01:01:53,177 --> 01:01:54,979
Operation Crepe Suzette.

776
01:01:55,012 --> 01:01:57,114
What else?

777
01:01:57,147 --> 01:01:59,516
That it's top-secret.
So far, that's all.

778
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,451
But he's planned a weekend
in the country

779
01:02:01,485 --> 01:02:03,888
and I'll contact you
as soon as I have the information.

780

[Hanging up]

781
01:02:23,273 --> 01:02:24,875
Bill?

782
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:29,313
Major Larrabee?

[Choir singing in French]

784
01:04:13,017 --> 01:04:14,184
Look.

785
01:04:52,322 --> 01:04:54,058
Bonjour.

[Thunder rumbling]

791
01:06:53,577 --> 01:06:55,245
- Bill.
- Hmm?

792
01:06:55,279 --> 01:06:56,413
Do me a favor.

793
01:06:56,446 --> 01:06:57,747
Sure.

794
01:06:59,549 --> 01:07:02,652
No lines, no campaign.

795
01:07:02,686 --> 01:07:06,156
In the first place, it isn't necessary
and in the second place,

796
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:08,558
I... I want whatever happens
this weekend to be honest.

797
01:07:08,592 --> 01:07:11,695
Well, since I have
nothing to gain by lying to you,

798
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:17,501
I think you're the most provocative,

799
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:19,269
exciting,

800
01:07:19,303 --> 01:07:21,771
and most desirable woman
I've ever met.

801
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,574
I'll buy that.

- Bon soir.
- Champagne, monsieur.

- Hmm?

825
01:10:14,611 --> 01:10:16,780
Would you excuse me just one minute?

826

Be right back.

827
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:24,888
Shan't be long.

828
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:36,733
Are you out of your mind?

829
01:10:36,766 --> 01:10:38,268
He lied to you.

830
01:10:38,302 --> 01:10:39,369
What?

831
01:10:39,403 --> 01:10:41,371
He didn't fly last weekend.

832
01:10:41,405 --> 01:10:43,507
There was no encounter
with Von Richthofen.

833
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:45,975
Larrabee's squadron
was in the air, but Larrabee was not.

834
01:10:46,009 --> 01:10:47,711
Moreover, we've checked every channel

835
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:49,413
and nothing at all has filtered down

836
01:10:49,446 --> 01:10:51,381
about any Operation Crepe Suzette.

837
01:10:51,415 --> 01:10:55,051
So, either it is
even more important than we imagined

838
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:57,287
or it simply doesn't exist.

839
01:10:59,055 --> 01:11:00,557
And if it doesn't?

840
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:02,892
Then he's onto you.

841
01:11:02,926 --> 01:11:04,794
It's possible, I suppose,

842
01:11:04,828 --> 01:11:07,931
but my every instinct says no.

843
01:11:07,964 --> 01:11:10,500
Then what's the alternative?

844
01:11:10,534 --> 01:11:12,001
Another woman?

845
01:11:14,404 --> 01:11:16,005
It's our opinion that Major Larrabee

846
01:11:16,039 --> 01:11:18,375
is giving information to a woman.

847
01:11:18,408 --> 01:11:19,809

with Operation Crepe Suzette?

No.

862
01:11:54,878 --> 01:11:56,312

- Oh.

Oh, darling, I'm sorry.

No, no, no. It's ok.

01:12:33,116 --> 01:12:34,818
- It was an accident.
- No, it's ok.

- Oh, I've ruined your shirt.
- Doesn't matter.

Well, shouldn't you change?

It's coming off in a minute anyway.

Well, I was just going to ask you.

01:12:48,465 --> 01:12:50,166
Ask me what?

875
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:51,868
What's wrong?

876
01:12:51,901 --> 01:12:53,703
- With me?
- Yeah.

877
01:12:53,737 --> 01:12:55,905
Well, nothing, darling,

878
01:12:55,939 --> 01:12:58,141
but I do sense something about you.

879
01:12:58,174 --> 01:13:00,477
Me?

880
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:01,878
It's really not important.

881
01:13:01,911 --> 01:13:04,514
Well, of course it's important.

882
01:13:04,548 --> 01:13:05,958
The girl that went into that bedroom

883
01:13:05,982 --> 01:13:07,751
is not the same girl
who just walked out.

884
01:13:07,784 --> 01:13:09,786
- Rubbish.
- It's not rubbish.

885
01:13:09,819 --> 01:13:11,855
We're having our first fight.

886
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:13,899
We are not fighting. I am simply
trying to point out...

Oh, come, now.
You've got to admit,

903
01:15:42,105 --> 01:15:45,341
seduction can really be very
funny if you stop to think about it.

904
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:47,744
You're not supposed to stop
and think about it.

905

Oh, Bill, that's a terribly
naive point of view

it shouldn't matter anyway.

You know how I've resisted your

Well, there is something
I now feel I must tell you.

1297
01:45:16,110 --> 01:45:17,779
Major Larrabee has said several things

1298
01:45:17,812 --> 01:45:19,747
which make it absolutely clear

1299
01:45:19,781 --> 01:45:23,551
that he is indeed
passing important military information

- Would it have been easier to replace me?
- Hmm.

1318
01:46:43,665 --> 01:46:45,600
Captain Duvalle
was suspicious of Suzette,

1319
01:46:45,633 --> 01:46:47,811
but, sooner or later,
he was bound to discover the truth,

1320

unless he had
positive evidence against her.

1321
01:46:50,137 --> 01:46:51,639
I decided to protect myself

Lili, surely you must've known
that by implicating Suzette,

1333
01:47:16,631 --> 01:47:18,866
you could not help
but implicate the major.

1443
01:57:36,583 --> 01:57:39,086
Gentlemen. Lili, let's go.

1444
01:57:39,120 --> 01:57:40,521
[Gun firing]

1445
01:57:40,554 --> 01:57:42,089
- Oh.
- Let's run.

1446
01:57:56,670 --> 01:57:58,872
It's no good, Kurt.
I told them, I confessed.

1447
01:57:58,905 --> 01:58:01,551
I didn't implicate you or any of
the others, but they know about me.

1448
01:58:01,575 --> 01:58:02,852
You're bleeding,
you should see a doctor.

1449
01:58:02,876 --> 01:58:05,146
Bedford, drive to Dr. Rene's house.

1450
01:58:05,179 --> 01:58:07,790
- We are not going to Dr. Rene's house.
But you must get this seen to.

1451
01:58:07,814 --> 01:58:09,892
- We are going to the railway station.
- Railway station?

1452
01:58:09,916 --> 01:58:12,153
- And then we're going to Switzerland.
- Switzerland?

1453
01:58:12,186 --> 01:58:14,288
Oh, Kurt, you can
go to Switzerland, but I can't go.

1454
01:58:14,321 --> 01:58:15,465
I told them, they know about me.

1455
01:58:15,489 --> 01:58:17,158
I wasn't joking.
I told them.

1456
01:58:17,191 --> 01:58:18,768
- I'm sure you did.
- What if you're seen with me?

1457
01:58:18,792 --> 01:58:20,527
- May I please say something?
- What?

1458
01:58:20,561 --> 01:58:22,305
For someone who's always been
the personification

1459
01:58:22,329 --> 01:58:23,673
of quick-wittedness
and indefectible judgment,

1460
01:58:23,697 --> 01:58:25,666
you're suddenly making decisions

1461
01:58:25,699 --> 01:58:28,145
- with all the cunning of a headless chicken.
- What do you mean?

1462
01:58:28,169 --> 01:58:30,637
Look, you confessed
in order to save Major Larrabee.

1463
01:58:30,671 --> 01:58:31,738
Yes.

1464
01:58:31,772 --> 01:58:32,906
Because he is innocent.

1465
01:58:32,939 --> 01:58:34,208
- Yes.
- Is he?

1466
01:58:34,241 --> 01:58:35,809
Oh, don't be an ass.

1467
01:58:35,842 --> 01:58:37,911
- He didn't tell that woman a thing.
- Which woman?

1468
01:58:37,944 --> 01:58:39,680
Suzette. She's not a spy.

1469
01:58:39,713 --> 01:58:41,582
- But he told you.
- Well, of course he did.

1470
01:58:41,615 --> 01:58:45,386
- And you are a spy.
- And Suzette, who is not,

1471
01:58:45,419 --> 01:58:46,929
has a very good chance
of proving that she is not.

1472
01:58:46,953 --> 01:58:50,157
Thereby exonerating the Major.
Because without the real spy,

1473
01:58:50,191 --> 01:58:52,226
the government has no case.

1474
01:58:52,259 --> 01:58:54,261
But now, my dear, they have.

1475
01:58:54,295 --> 01:58:55,896
Oh, oh, my God.

1476
01:58:57,398 --> 01:58:58,699
And so you have no alternative.

1477
01:58:58,732 --> 01:59:00,401
If you stay and are convicted

1478
01:59:00,434 --> 01:59:02,503
the Major will
undoubtedly face a court-martial,

1479
01:59:02,536 --> 01:59:05,339
but if you can escape to Switzerland
and remain there incommunicado

1480
01:59:05,372 --> 01:59:09,843
until the appropriate time,
you might just save us all.

1481
01:59:09,876 --> 01:59:11,316

[Panting]

1491
02:01:11,097 --> 02:01:13,300
I'm gonna cover you up with this.

1492
02:01:13,334 --> 02:01:15,602
Try to sit quietly,
and don't move around too much.

1493
02:01:15,636 --> 02:01:16,803
Yes, nurse.

1494
02:01:16,837 --> 02:01:17,938
Don't be patronizing.

1495
02:01:17,971 --> 02:01:19,606
Put your feet up.

1496
02:01:49,135 --> 02:01:51,581
The best thing for us will be
to hide at the farm for a few days

1497
02:01:51,605 --> 02:01:52,839
before we try Switzerland.

1498
02:01:52,873 --> 02:01:54,941
What about the Colonel and Miss Lili?

1499
02:01:54,975 --> 02:01:58,912
If there's no trouble,
they'll be across the border by morning.

1500

(Kurt)
Don't be unhappy, darling,

1501
02:02:10,824 --> 02:02:12,526
because there's a good possibility

1502
02:02:12,559 --> 02:02:14,795
the fighting will be over
before too very long

1503
02:02:14,828 --> 02:02:16,797
and then,

1504
02:02:16,830 --> 02:02:21,768
if he really loves you,
he'll find you, wherever you are.

1505
02:02:21,802 --> 02:02:24,070
He'd be better off if he didn't.

1506
02:02:24,104 --> 02:02:26,473
I always seem to mess things up.

1507
02:02:28,642 --> 02:02:31,612
I tried to put it all right,
and it all went wrong.

[Sobbing]

1509
02:02:35,181 --> 02:02:38,619
I wanted so to justify
your confidence in me.

1510
02:02:38,652 --> 02:02:41,988
I've always admired you and loved you

1511
02:02:42,022 --> 02:02:44,658
and respected you, and what happens?

1512
02:02:44,691 --> 02:02:47,661
He gets court-martialed,
and you get shot,

1513
02:02:47,694 --> 02:02:51,732
and here I am on this wretched train
going to Switzerland.

1514
02:02:51,765 --> 02:02:54,601
Well, we have one consolation:

1515
02:02:54,635 --> 02:02:56,737
Things can't get much worse.

1516
02:03:01,007 --> 02:03:02,543
[Larrabee laughing]

1517
02:03:02,576 --> 02:03:05,011
You think it's funny?

1518
02:03:05,045 --> 02:03:08,482
Lili Smith tells you she's a German spy

1519
02:03:08,515 --> 02:03:10,684
and you don't think it's funny?

1520
02:03:11,918 --> 02:03:13,587
Well, I admit that at first,

1521
02:03:13,620 --> 02:03:15,789
it did seem somewhat implausible.

1522
02:03:15,822 --> 02:03:17,491
Implausible?

1523
02:03:17,524 --> 02:03:19,493
(Duvalle)
Well, at first I thought it nothing more

1524
02:03:19,526 --> 02:03:20,961
than an attempt to exonerate you.

1525
02:03:20,994 --> 02:03:22,763
But she was in possession
of certain facts.

1526
02:03:22,796 --> 02:03:23,897
Gentlemen,

1527
02:03:23,930 --> 02:03:25,432
Lili's an actress.

1528
02:03:25,466 --> 02:03:27,501
- Yes.
- Of course, I considered that,

1529
02:03:27,534 --> 02:03:29,736
but when she was kidnapped...

1530
02:03:29,770 --> 02:03:30,837
Kidnapped?

1531
02:03:30,871 --> 02:03:31,972
Yes, it seemed...

1532
02:03:32,005 --> 02:03:34,107
Did you say "kidnapped"?

1533
02:03:34,140 --> 02:03:37,544
Yes, we were bringing her to see you,
to confront you with the evidence...

1534
02:03:37,578 --> 02:03:38,745
Who kidnapped her?

1535
02:03:38,779 --> 02:03:40,022
- We've no idea.
- I must insist...

1536
02:03:40,046 --> 02:03:41,615
- Shut up!
- A man jumped out of a car.

1537
02:03:41,648 --> 02:03:43,750
There were some shots and poof.

1538
02:03:43,784 --> 02:03:45,652
- What do you mean, "poof"?
- She was gone.

1539
02:03:45,686 --> 02:03:47,120
With Captain Duvalle's best suit.

1540
02:03:47,153 --> 02:03:49,990
- What did you do about it?
- Well, we came to see you.

1541
02:03:50,023 --> 02:03:52,693
We thought you might shed
some light on the matter.

1542
02:04:17,918 --> 02:04:20,186
This is the bathroom.

1543
02:04:20,220 --> 02:04:22,022
Yep.

Why don't you shoot?

1565
02:05:51,044 --> 02:05:52,779
He can't.

1566
02:05:52,813 --> 02:05:55,048
He doesn't have
the necessary authority.

1567
02:05:56,917 --> 02:05:59,886
Well, he was doing pretty well
earlier this evening.

1568
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:02,122
Herr Kraus is not trying to kill me.

1569
02:06:02,155 --> 02:06:04,891
He has orders only to eliminate you,

1570
02:06:04,925 --> 02:06:06,192
but he cannot do that now.

1571
02:06:07,828 --> 02:06:09,796
Why not?

1572
02:06:09,830 --> 02:06:11,632
Because he knows that if he shoots you,

1573
02:06:11,665 --> 02:06:14,768
he will most certainly have to kill me.

1574
02:06:14,801 --> 02:06:16,036
Oh.

02:06:16,069 --> 02:06:19,239
Don't underestimate me, Colonel.

1576
02:06:19,272 --> 02:06:22,943
I don't think I do.

1577
02:06:22,976 --> 02:06:26,913
Killing me without proper orders
would lead to a firing squad

1578
02:06:26,947 --> 02:06:29,115
or at the very least,
a general court-martial.

1579
02:06:29,149 --> 02:06:32,285
Shortly before we reach Switzerland,

1580
02:06:32,318 --> 02:06:34,888
I shall stop this train,
and we shall get off.

But why are we going to her house?

1588
02:06:57,143 --> 02:06:59,680
Because if she's a spy,
there is a very good chance

1589

that the butler and the maid
are in league with her.

Don't be an idiot.

02:07:05,786 --> 02:07:07,420
We must take them by surprise,

1593
02:07:07,453 --> 02:07:09,289
