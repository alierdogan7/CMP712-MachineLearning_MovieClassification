00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:22,811
Doshy: Now, maybe I can get some sleep.

283
00:27:22,811 --> 00:27:30,459
Johnny: You think they're waiting for me?
Remus: Dey ain't passin' de time o' day.

284
00:27:35,036 --> 00:27:36,956
Sally: Son! Where have you been?

285
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,900
Remus: Lawzy, Miss Sally, didn't sis
Tempy tell you he was wid me?

286
00:27:39,933 --> 00:27:42,877

but it's so long past Johnny's bedtime.

287
00:27:42,909 --> 00:27:46,813
Remus: Tooby sho, Miss Sally.
I was tellin' him a tale 'bout Brer Rabbit.

288
00:27:46,941 --> 00:27:51,741
Remus: An' I plum forgot de time.
Sally: Well, I don't mind your telling him stories, Uncle Remus.

289
00:27:51,742 --> 00:27:54,622
Sally: But you know perfectly well,
it's too late for him to be up.

290
00:27:54,814 --> 00:27:56,702
Remus: Yessum. 'Twon't happen again, Miss Sally.

291
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:01,630
Sally: I'm sure it won't. Well, son, let's

296
00:28:27,553 --> 00:28:29,857

doesn't count for much these days.

297
00:28:30,018 --> 00:28:32,834
Remus: Yassum, it's a pity, too.
What dat child needs is his paw.

298
00:28:32,994 --> 00:28:35,842
Doshy: And that's what his mother needs...
But I'm afraid it's going to take

299
00:28:35,874 --> 00:28:37,826
Doshy: a little while for her to find that out.

300
00:28:37,858 --> 00:28:40,898
Remus: Might cut de time down a piece,
Miss Doshy, if you jes' draps a word.

301
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:45,635
Doshy: If I want your advice I'll ask for it.
I'm a stubborn old woman Uncle Remus

302
00:28:45,795 --> 00:28:49,635
Remus: Yassum, Miss Doshy,
I knows dat. Well, goodnight.

303
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:51,651
Doshy: Goodnight.

304
00:28:51,812 --> 00:28:53,700
Remus: You ain't mad wid
me, is you, Miss Doshy?

305
00:28:53,796 --> 00:28:57,604
Doshy: You meddling old rascal!
Of course I'm not mad with you.

00:31:26,931 --> 00:31:31,795
Johnny: And the collar, too?
Sally: Yes, dear, of course. She made it for you herself.

322
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:36,659
Sally: She'll want to see how nice it looks on you.
Johnny: But Toby and I were goin frog huntin'.

Jake: Why not?

626
00:56:56,229 --> 00:57:01,221
Johnny: Just don't you tell her,
that's all! If you do, it'll be awful!

627
00:57:06,918 --> 00:57:09,862
Toby: Ain't dat what Brer Rabbit did to Brer Fox?

628
00:57:09,863 --> 00:57:17,095
Johnny: sh-sh! Bein' little... an' without much strength,

He told us not to tell our maw.

01:00:42,243 --> 01:00:43,427
Sally: Is that right, uncle remus?

01:00:53,636 --> 01:00:55,492
Jake: Johnny said he didn't

01:00:55,877 --> 01:00:57,253
Jake: bute not to tell our maw.

674
01:00:57,541 --> 01:00:59,621
Joe: and when we told her,
she giv'd us a whuppin'.

675
01:01:02,693 --> 01:01:06,693
Remus: <chuckle> Lawzy, Miss
Sally, Johnny didn't mean no harm.

676
01:01:06,726 --> 01:01:10,534
Remus: He was jes' trying to be like
Brer Rabbit. I tol' him a tale 'bout de

677
01:01:12,102 --> 01:01:15,686
Remus: tar baby an' he just got a li'I bit too
bodacious, and outreached hisse'f, dat's all.

678
01:01:16,551 --> 01:01:22,023
Sally: Uncle Remus, i'm trying my best to bring up
Johnny to be obedient and truthful. But you and your

679
01:01:22,343 --> 01:01:27,015
Sally: stories are making that very difficult. I think maybe
it would be better if he didn't hear any more for awhile.

680
01:01:27,048 --> 01:01:30,344
Remus: Well, Miss Sally,
de stories ain't done no...

681
01:01:30,344 --> 01:01:34,888
Sally: They only confuse him. Now I know you
mean well, Uncle Remus, but Johnny's too young.

682
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,104
Remus: Miss Sally...

683
01:01:36,136 --> 01:01:38,792
Sally: I'll have to ask you
not to tell him any more.

684
01:01:42,217 --> 01:01:44,521
Remus: Yassum, Miss Sally...

685
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:58,410
Sally: But what else could I have done, mama? I
can't just overlook it, he has to learn to mind.

686
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:01,643
Doshy: That's very true, but without
Uncle Remus and his stories,

687
01:02:01,675 --> 01:02:07,339
Doshy: the child will be utterly desolate.
He needs something to hold on to.

688
01:02:07,371 --> 01:02:10,187
Sally: Well, he has his
mother... and his grandmother.

689
01:02:11,532 --> 01:02:16,556
Doshy: We're not enough, sally. The boy must have
friends. And if it's not Uncle Remus, or the Favers

690
01:02:16,588 --> 01:02:23,244
Doshy: children, then it must be someone else...
someone of his own age. That's just good common sense.

691
01:02:26,029 --> 01:02:30,573
Tempy: What you trackin' through here for anyway?
Ain't I done tol' you 'bout messin' 'roun' my kitchen?

692
01:02:36,718 --> 01:02:37,838
Sally: Johnny!

693
01:02:39,567 --> 01:02:40,591
Johnny: Yes, mama.

694
01:02:42,249 --> 01:02:45,161
Sally: Do you know what next tuesday is?

695
01:02:45,193 --> 01:02:47,657
Johnny: Uh... of course. My birthday.

696
01:02:47,689 --> 01:02:51,401
Sally: That's right, dear.
And what happens then?

697
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,034
Johnny: I get presents.

698
01:02:53,066 --> 01:02:55,754
Sally: And a birthday
party. Would you like that?

699
01:02:55,786 --> 01:02:57,802
Johnny: A party? Sure!

700
01:02:57,834 --> 01:02:59,850
Sally: With lots of nice
little boys and girls.

701
01:02:59,882 --> 01:03:02,186
Johnny: Can i ask Ginny?

702
01:03:03,211 --> 01:03:05,451
Sally: Well, there'll be so
many other children, dear...

703
01:03:05,483 --> 01:03:07,915
Doshy: That one more
won't make any difference.

704
01:03:07,947 --> 01:03:13,003
Johnny: Gee! Thanks! Will daddy come?

705
01:03:13,036 --> 01:03:22,796
Sally: Well, dear... uh... I'll
write and ask him.

706
01:03:22,829 --> 01:03:26,829
Johnny: Oh boy.

707
01:03:32,718 --> 01:03:35,054
Johnny: Teenchy! Here Teenchy!

708
01:03:37,614 --> 01:03:42,030
Johnny: Teenchy! Here Teenchy!
Teenchy! Where are you?

709
01:03:42,063 --> 01:03:51,823
Johnny: Uncle Remus? A present
for Teenchy! Where's Teenchy?

710
01:03:51,855 --> 01:03:54,383
Remus: He's gone.

711
01:03:54,416 --> 01:04:02,224
Johnny: Gone? Then we gotta find him. Sump'n
might happen to him... if he runs around loose.

712
01:04:03,473 --> 01:04:05,713
Remus: He ain't runnin' 'roun' loose.

713
01:04:05,745 --> 01:04:09,169
Johnny: Then, where is he?

714
