3
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,810
Ah...How wonderful it is!

4
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,980
Did you say something, Margarita?

5
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,690
That crown-wearing swan!

6
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,710
Isn't it wonderful?

7
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,300
Wait just a sec!

8
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,670
What are you doing, Hans?

9
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,690
It might be a bit big...

10
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,510
Oh well.

11
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,360
Thank you for waiting.

12
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,000
What's that?

13
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,060
Now, Princess Margarita...

14
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,500
please close your eyes.

15
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,240
Oh Hans...

16
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,050
Will this do?

17
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,280
Oh...!

18
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,530
Is it okay now?

19
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,320
What's wrong, Hans?

20
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,090
Errrr...sorry!

21
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,690
How rude!

22
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,470
I hate you Hans!

23
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,570
Oh my...could that be...

24
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,110
Prince Siegfried?

25
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,050
I still hate you!

26
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,600
Wait for me, Margarita!

27
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,440
Margarita!

28
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,420
That's payback for just now!

29
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,080
Ah...how elegant he is!

30
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,310
Totally unlike Hans...

31
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,570
Stop comparing me to the Prince, please!

32
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,000
Hey...

33
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,950
Speaking of that, when are you 
going to be my wife?

34
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,890
How arrogant! Who would marry you?

35
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,760
Ahhh! He's here!

36
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,970
How wonderful...!

37
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,630
Be careful!!

38
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,470
Thank you Hans.

39
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,780
Again...Oh Hans, really!

40
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,740
Don't tell me...

41
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,090
It feels almost like a beautiful woman 
looking at me.

42
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,390
Prince! Prince!

43
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,690
What is the matter?

44
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,250
Look at that!

45
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,570
How the...the swan is wearing a crown!

46
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,860
What a rare sight this is!

47
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,310
The swans are...

48
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,120
What are you doing, Adolf!

49
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,810
Observe as I take the rare swan out in one shot!

50
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:12,500
Don't do it!

51
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,590
Adolf!

52
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,660
Adolf has become stone!

53
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,330
Prince, this is a magical forest!

54
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,280
This must be the doing of that crown-wearing swan!

55
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,360
How could that be...?

56
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,700
Let us flee from here, Prince!

57
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,310
Nothing good will come from staying long 
in this horrible place.

58
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,150
How mysterious...

59
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:18,940
No.

60
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,890
There is nothing mysterious about it at all,
 my Prince.

61
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:25,810
That crown-bearing swan is a magician.

62
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:30,640
Now that I think of it, no one has plumbed 
the depths of that lake.

63
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,930
But I find the notion that the precious swan 
is a magician...

64
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,060
...to be totally unbelievable.

65
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,630
But my Prince, you were there when Adolf 
he tried to shoot the swan.

66
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,590
As a result, he got turned to stone.

67
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,270
Therefore, I think it would be wise to avoid 
the lake...

68
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,800
Your Highness...

69
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,180
Her Majesty the Empress seeks an audience.

70
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,380
How does my Esteemed Mother?

71
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,200
Siegfried.

72
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,140
At long last, tomorrow is the day you become a man.

73
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:03,660
Certainly.

74
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:09,210
Due to the early passing of your Father,
you will become this castle's master starting 
tomorrow.

75
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,040
Yes.

76
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,640
In consideration of that fact, let us 
choose for you a bride.

77
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,380
My bride?

78
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,310
Indeed

79
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,100
The ruler of a country is in need of a queen.

80
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,600
But...

81
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,940
Please do not worry

82
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,930
I have already invited the most beautiful 
girls from our surrounding countries...

83
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,650
...to the ball tomorrow.

84
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:36,410
You may then choose from within their ranks 
whosoever you most fancy to be your bride.

85
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,580
But mother...!

86
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,310
I am still...

87
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,750
No...

88
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,220
Because you are about to come of age...

89
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,650
it would be unseemly to remain in singlehood.

90
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:49,390
Or perhaps there is someone you already love?

91
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,810
No, that is not so.

92
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,100
In that case, is that satisfactory?

93
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,460
Yes.

94
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,310
Congratulations, Prince.

95
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,610
Benno, do not joke with me!

96
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,090
Even if it were for the sake of becoming 
the king of this country,

97
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,530
I cannot marry someone I do not love!

98
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,960
What is there to congratulate me on?

99
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:30,250
However, I cannot go against my Mother's wishes.

100
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,610
That cannot be helped.

101
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,720
That is the fate you were born with, as a Prince.

102
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,640
I know that!

103
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,680
I know...but...

104
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,230
Benno!

105
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,710
Yes!

106
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,450
What is it?

107
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:20,090
I want to see that mysterious swan again.

108
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,310
What?

109
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,090
I don't know why, but I am fascinated by it.

110
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,900
But...that swan is a magic...

111
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,400
If that crown-bearing swan were really a magician,

112
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:34,580
I must see it again, to somehow plead for Adolf's life.

113
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,830
That cannot do, my Prince.

114
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,170
If something should happen to you...

115
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,100
No.

116
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:43,680
I cannot believe that the swan is a magician.

117
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,800
But...

118
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,990
Why is it...?

119
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,630
Why is there something like this here?

120
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,200
Hans! Hans!

121
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,600
What is it, Margarita?

122
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,270
Look, the crown-wearing swan is going home.

123
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,720
Adolf, wait for me.

124
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,020
It's Prince Siegfried.

125
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,160
It's there.

126
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,020
Look. The swan is departing.

127
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,790
Let us give chase!

128
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,130
The Prince is chasing after the crown-wearing swan.

129
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,740
Hans! Hurry up! What're you doing?

130
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,680
I have to go too?

131
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,180
Damn. It's a dead-end!

132
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,040
My Prince...let's just give up!

133
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:30,580
My Prince, this is impossible! We cannot 
ride up this mountain!

134
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,080
How amazingly courageous is the Prince!

135
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,650
The Prince's companion seems to be 
having difficulties.

136
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,840
Please wait for me, Prince!

137
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,330
Prince!

138
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,460
Margarita!

139
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,910
What is it, Hans?

140
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,290
Where are we going?

141
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,610
What an idiot! Isn't it obvious?

142
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,470
You don't have to call me an idiot!!

143
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,880
Margarita, it's dangerous...let's go back.

144
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:11,990
We can't do that.

145
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:12,920
Alright...!

146
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,070
Help me!

147
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,800
Margarita!

148
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,950
No, I can't...
- Margarita!

149
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:27,960
It's the end...goodbye, my Prince...

150
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:33,240
Really! She has no consideration for me at all...

151
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,780
The Prince, indeed!

152
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,280
Whoa...

153
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,980
Come, let's go!

154
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,610
Where on earth is that swan heading to?

155
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,390
Whoa!

156
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,920
What a place!

157
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:57,920


158
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,290
This is...

159
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,860
The crown-bearing swan...

160
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,230
has become a human!

161
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,630
This is an enchanted forest...

162
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,040
Let's go home, Margarita!

163
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,550
No...it's alright.

164
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,930
The Prince is here after all.

165
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,430
Prince Siegfried.

166
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,680
H-How did you know my name...?

167
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,570
Who on earth are you?

168
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,670
Why were you in the guise of a swan?

169
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,100
My name is Odette.

170
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:00,470
Odette...

171
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,410
Odette. Are you really a swan...

172
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,540
...or are you human?

173
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,720
I am a human.

174
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:14,160
But because of the wizard, I must 
stay in the form of a swan.

175
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,050
Because of a wizard?

176
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:16,740
Yes.

177
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:23,180
And I can only return to my human form 
during the night.

178
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:27,170
In that case, the one who turned my 
companion to stone was...

179
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,070
It's the doing of Rothbart.

180
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,410
Rothbart?

181
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,830
Whilst you were at the lake, did you 
not see a black owl?

182
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,040
Now that I think of it,

183
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,550
there was an owl with a distinctively 
evil presence.

184
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,970
That was the Wizard Rothbart.

185
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,750
In the form of an owl.

186
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,120
In the form of an owl?

187
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,200
Please hurry and return home, Prince Siegfried.

188
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,260
Rothbart is sure to be watching.

189
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,140
In that case...this castle must be Rothbart's...

190
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,190
That's the wizard's lair...

191
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,970
Will the Prince be alright?

192
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,570
How dare he, that Rothbart!

193
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,370
Please wait a moment, Prince Siegfried.

194
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,120
Do not try to stop me.

195
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,680
I must save the petrified Adolf.

196
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:12,610
No.

197
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:17,060
Rothbart cannot be defeated by mere human strength.

198
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,160
How would we know without even trying?

199
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,250
When we tried to oppose Rothbart,

200
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,760
my country was obliterated.

201
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,890
Your country...?

202
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,610
Your country was obliterated?

203
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,990
I was the princess of another country.

204
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,180
Three years ago, Rothbart appeared at our country.

205
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,790
He wanted me to be his wife.

206
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:45,170
Both my father and I refused,

207
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,750
so starting with my father, he 
destroyed the entire country.

208
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,000
And he brought me here.

209
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:55,450
But why did Rothbart give you the
form of a swan?

210
00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:00,000
That is because he did not want other 
men to see me.

211
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:00,670
Why is that?

212
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,680
If someone should appear that I loved 
from the bottom of my heart,

213
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,400
Rothbart's power would disappear.

214
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:12,790
That is why whilst it is day I have the
 form of a swan,

215
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,240
so that no one could fall in love with me.

216
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,180
Is that true?

217
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,310
Yes.

218
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:23,190
When I was first brought here, that was
 what Rothbart told me

219
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,010
before turning me into a swan.

220
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,330
If that is true,

221
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,030
let my opponent be Rothbart.

222
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:32,130
You can't! If you say that, Rothbart will...

223
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,190
No.

224
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:38,380
When I first saw you today as a swan
 at the lake,

225
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:42,030
my heart was captivated by you.

226
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,840
At that time, you...

227
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,010
It's those eyes!

228
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,290
The eyes of the swan back then.

229
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,250
Odette...

230
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,880
Odette!

231
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,890
Tomorrow, at my castle,

232
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,790
there is a ball to celebrate my coming of age.

233
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,360
Please attend, by all means.

234
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:13,730
I...I want to make you my queen.

235
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,720
No...no...

236
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,810
That cannot be...I can't!

237
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:20,640
Odette!

238
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:24,460
Please come to my castle.

239
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,800
There, I will swear my love to you.

240
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,590
From thence on, there will be nothing to fear!

241
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:34,260
Even though I would like to, as long 
as Rothbart is here, I cannot.

242
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,190
Goodbye, Prince Siegfried!

243
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,930
Wait, Odette!

244
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,920
I beseech you to return home.

245
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,100
Rothbart is a fearsome man.

246
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
Tomorrow, you will come, won't you?

247
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,410
I will be waiting.

248
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:52,910
I have no intention of letting anyone 
but you be my queen.

249
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,710
Please come.

250
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,950
Please return home.

251
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,620
Otherwise, I cannot make any promises.

252
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,440
I will go now, so please be sure to come.

253
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,570
You must come!

254
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:40,210
As the flames blazed up, I looked 
intently into your eyes

255
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:47,060
You fixed your eyes on me.

256
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:54,700
Embarassed, my chest flutters.

257
00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:01,810
Embarassed, my tears overflow.

258
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:10,020
This is the first time I have felt these emotions

259
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:17,480
To experience the day my love will return

260
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:28,100
I think that was the reason for my birth.

261
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,900
Father! Father!

262
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,250
Oh my, you're still obliviously sleeping?

263
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:10,950
Father, the sun has set already!

264
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,940
You are unusually tired today, aren't you?

265
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:26,070
That's probably because I turned the guy 
who was trying to kill Odette to stone.

266
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,770
It's tiring, using magic in the daytime.

267
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,680
It's time to get up, eh.

268
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,740
You are quite infatuated with Odette, aren't you?

269
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,980
The night is my realm.

270
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:43,050
Tonight, I shall once again seek to marry Odette.

271
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,960
I might get lucky tonight...

272
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:52,380
Oh, my dearest Odette!

273
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,880
Please wait for me.

274
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,890
Father, is it okay for you to be so relaxed?

275
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,590
What?

276
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:06,030
Your dearest Odette saw a young man today.

277
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:06,720
What?

278
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,950
Why did you not tell me earlier?

279
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,680
What are you talking about?

280
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,210
You are the one who was bumbling around! Really!

281
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,610
So, this young man...

282
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,080
...what sort of man is he?

283
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,210
Are you concerned?

284
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:20,480
Of course I am!

285
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,670
But speaking of that, he's certainly something...

286
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,930
that Siegfried!

287
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,150
Siegfried?

288
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,430
He's that castle's prince.

289
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,900
Really?

290
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,310
Yes.

291
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:36,950
Anyway, he invited her to the ball where he 
will choose his queen tomorrow evening.

292
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:39,340
"Will you come, or will you not?"

293
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,930
That Siegfried!

294
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,840
That is unforgivable!

295
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,730
For goodness' sake, father!

296
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,400
Where is he?

297
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,000
Where could he be?

298
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:54,520
That rascal Siegfried! Where are you? 
Where are you hiding?

299
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,760
Are you so afraid of me that you have 
concealed yourself?

300
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,310
You won't find him anywhere.

301
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,770
What did you say?

302
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,490
He's left long ago.

303
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:06,900
Then...what about Odette?

304
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,660
Let's see...she's probably dreaming of Siegfried,

305
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,390
her heart brimming with thoughts of him.

306
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:19,010
For her to be chosen by such a young and 
wonderful prince,

307
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,250
even you would be pretty worried, eh?

308
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,680
Shut up!!

309
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,120
Ooh, scary...

310
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:29,170
Now that it has come to this, I will have 
to be ruthless, even if it's Odette.

311
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,290
Odette, Odette...

312
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,010
My lovely Odette...

313
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:29,000
How do you do, Odette?

314
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,020
So who did you meet today?

315
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,450
Could it be Prince Siegfried from the castle?

316
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,920
H-How could you know...?

317
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:46,010
Did you think I wouldn't know something like that?

318
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,160
But of course, it would have been better
 for me not to know.

319
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,730
Oh well, let's forget about that man.

320
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,990
How about it, Odette?

321
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:59,820
Isn't it about time you agreed to be my wife?

322
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:03,870
I've waited for three years. You should 
know my feelings.

323
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,470
Won't you make me a happy man with your 
answer tonight, eh?

324
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,020
Odette?

325
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,190
My dearest Odette!

326
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:26,860
If you become my wife,
you will have a life of extravagance!

327
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:31,860
I swear that I will give you luxury greater
 than anything a queen could imagine.

328
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,590
Why will you not answer?

329
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,240
Do you not like talking to me?

330
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,090
As long as you do not answer,
you will continue to be a swan.

331
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,250
Is that alright with you?

332
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,740
I do not want a life of luxury,

333
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,010
nor do I wish for a magnificient lifestyle.

334
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,280
I only want...

335
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:01,410
Only...? What would you want?

336
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,240
I only want to be with the one I love.

337
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,680
The one you love?

338
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,550
It can't be. It can't be.

339
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,000
It can't be. Don't tell me...

340
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,190
Don't tell me that the one you love

341
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,300
is that Siegfried character?

342
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:29,940
Odette! I am truly in love with you!

343
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:31,840
Yet, you...yet, you...

344
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,460
Why! Why do you not love me?

345
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,720
Use your power to make me.

346
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,220
There is nothing you cannot do.

347
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,220
Aren't you the great Lord Rothbart?

348
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,130
Be quiet! Be quiet!

349
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,690
No matter how strong my magic is,

350
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,170
I cannot change the human heart.

351
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,000
If that were possible,

352
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,580
who would wait three years for you?

353
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:00,930
Odette, will you not have pity on me?

354
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,690
How long do you intend to make me wait?

355
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:03,930


356
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,830
Or is it really true that you love that Siegfried?

357
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:07,830
Yes.

358
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,940
Im-Impossible!

359
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:13,320
To love such a young boy you've only just met!

360
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:13,900
No.

361
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,240
For a long time already,

362
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:18,110
I've been in love with Prince Siegfried.

363
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,670
For a long time already?!

364
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,950
Yes. Prince Siegfried has always ridden 
his horse by the lake.

365
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:30,010
So the reason you hate me,

366
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,330
is because of that?

367
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:39,130
D-Do not make me angry, Odette!

368
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:42,630
I could turn you into a disgusting creature!

369
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,350
Even a grub!

370
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,400
Or a caterpillar!

371
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:47,050
Behold!

372
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:55,370
But I did not do that.

373
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,820
I only gave you the form of a beautiful swan!

374
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,530
Do you know why?

375
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:04,550
Is that not also a sign of my love for you?

376
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:05,580
No.

377
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,400
If you really loved me,

378
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,930
you would not do all these things 
against my wishes.

379
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,080
Now, Lord Rothbart.

380
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,410
If you really love me,

381
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,970
leave me immediately.

382
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,260
Please get out of this room now.

383
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,440
How dare you, how dare you say such a thing?!

384
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,250
Odette!

385
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:38,090
You wish to attend the Prince's ball?

386
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,890
Who would allow such a thing?

387
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,130
Who?

388
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,360
Who?

389
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,060
Tell me who would let you go?

390
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,700
I'm sorry, Canary.

391
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:11,100
How about that, Odette?

392
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,410
Now you are a caged bird.

393
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,210
At tomorrow's ball,

394
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:20,650
Siegfried will have to choose someone 
other than you to be his bride,

395
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,610
and swear his unending love to!

396
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,510
Prince Siegfried!

397
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,930
Prince Siegfried!

398
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,620
I must not let myself be soft-hearted.

399
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,600
That damn Odette!

400
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,560
Damn her!

401
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:21,970
Damn her, damn her...damn her!

402
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,160
And here I was wondering what all that noise was,

403
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,330
and it was you doing this after all.

404
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:54,800
What is so funny, Odil?

405
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,870
You got rejected again, Father?

406
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,000
Shut up!

407
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,780
It's no use.

408
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,340
No matter how long you wait,

409
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,530
she will not become your wife.

410
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,850
Shut up! Shut up!

411
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,180
You detest Odette, don't you?

412
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,440
I hate her!

413
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:14,510
I hate her because she is breaking my heart!

414
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,920
Then why don't you kill her?

415
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:16,670
What?

416
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,420
It'll all be fine if you kill Odette.

417
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:19,970
You've been waiting all these years

418
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,110
and you still can't make her yours.

419
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,240
Anyone would have killed her by now.

420
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:32,180
What's wrong, Father?

421
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,420
No, I cannot do that.

422
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:38,230
I could never raise my hand to kill 
that beautiful Odette.

423
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,910
How soft hearted you are!

424
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,550
If you won't kill her,

425
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,230
then I will help you do it.

426
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,780
No, Odil! Don't do it!

427
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:47,870
I truly love Odette.

428
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,390
I love her...

429
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,250
No, she will come.

430
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,960
She will.

431
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,330
But my Prince,

432
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:20,290
that wizard called Rothbart...

433
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,290
Say no more, Benno.

434
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,420
I have already decided in my heart

435
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,190
that with the exception of that girl,

436
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:27,470
I will choose no one else to be my queen.

437
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:30,760
But...if she should fail to turn up...

438
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,130
She'll come. Definitely.

439
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,560
I have faith in her.

440
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,430
I believe her.

441
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,570
Margarita!

442
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,260
Margarita, are you asleep already?

443
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,290
What is it, Hans?

444
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,380
Well...uh...

445
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:06,370
What is it?

446
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,780
Well...uh...

447
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,840
I was thinking about the Prince and 
Princess Odette, and...

448
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,160
and...uh...

449
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:16,580
that got me thinking about you and I...

450
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,450
and uh...

451
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,990
Oh, Hans,

452
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,140
You've always been so flattering to me.

453
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,350
To tell the truth,

454
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:28,660
I have also been thinking about them 
dancing in tomorrow's ball,

455
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,480
and how romantic it would be.

456
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,410
Margarita...

457
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,940
For goodness' sake, Hans, you 
interrupted my dream!

458
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,640
Hans, what are you doing?

459
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,660
What was I...

460
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:04,050
What...uh...uh...

461
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,510
You're strange, Hans.

462
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,960
Goodnight, Hans.

463
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,670
Tsk, she doesn't know how I feel...

464
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,100
Goodnight, Margarita.

465
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,050
Margarita!

466
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,510
Margarita, good morning!

467
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,470
Good morning!

468
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,200
That Margarita...

469
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:18,120
Huh? Where did she go?

470
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,720
Perhaps she went to the lake?

471
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,300
Margarita!

472
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,350
Margarita!

473
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,960
Margarita!

474
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,190
Shush!

475
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:37,860
Look at that!

476
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,190
How cute was that?

477
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:47,770
What's wrong, Hans?

478
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:50,850
The swans are crowded together 
and making a racket!

479
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:51,740
Really?

480
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,330
Something must have happened.

481
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,670
Hans, let's go take a look!

482
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,550
Princess Odette has not arrived.

483
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,110
That must be why they're making so much noise.

484
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,200
Did she get sick?

485
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:21,510
But she has been coming to this 
lake for three years,

486
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:24,440
without ever missing a day.

487
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,140
If that's the case, could it be...

488
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:31,230
Could she have been locked up by 
the wizard Rothbart?

489
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:35,400
Then she won't be able to go to the ball tonight!

490
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,830
If so, Prince Siegfried

491
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:41,620
will have no choice but to choose someone 
else to be his queen!

492
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,180
What should we do, Margarita?

493
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:46,090
What to do...what to do...

494
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:47,220
What to do?

495
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,460
I got it!

496
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:00,420
I will go to Prince Siegfried right 
away and tell him!

497
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,650
To the Prince?

498
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:03,260
Yes, because we don't have enough power

499
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,120
to save Princess Odette by ourselves.

500
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,380
That's true.

501
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:10,510
And Hans, you will go to the wizard's castle

502
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,580
and check what happened to Princess Odette.

503
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,890
Go to the wizard's castle?

504
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:16,940
I...Me...by myself?

505
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:20,350
Look, if you don't want to go,

506
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,540
that's alright.

507
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:26,250
In return, I will never be your wife. Hmph!

508
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:28,490
I got it, Margarita!

509
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,410
I'll go!

510
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,850
In that case, I'm counting on you!

511
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,270
Boy oh boy. It always ends up like this.

512
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,010
The ball is approaching...

513
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,730
I can't make it.

514
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,870
I just thought of a good idea!

515
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,110
How about we kill the prince?

516
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:22,360
Kill the prince?

517
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:23,830
If the prince were to perish,

518
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,030
Odette will have no choice but to love me.

519
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,670
You can't do that, father.

520
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,300
Even if the prince were to die,

521
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,940
his memory will remain in Odette's heart.

522
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:36,560
The Prince will continue to live
 in Odette's heart.

523
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:38,710
That's true.

524
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:41,770
What should I do? What should I do?

525
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:45,420
There is one, and only one solution.

526
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,560
What? You have a solution?

527
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:48,350
Yes.

528
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,950
What is it?

529
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,000
Please tell me, Odil!

530
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,240
The Prince only has to love another woman.

531
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:56,630
But,

532
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:00,810
Siegfried will not even look at 
anyone but Odette.

533
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,480
What should we do about that?

534
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,680
O-Odil?

535
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:14,650
Odette! Odette!

536
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,480
What are you doing, father?

537
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,700
Don't be mistaken!

538
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:21,020
You look so much like her,

539
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,410
you nearly fooled me!

540
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:23,460
How about it?

541
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:25,320
With this, Siegfried will

542
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,300
swear his love to me.

543
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,740
How fitting that you are my daughter!

544
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,450
Wonderful! What a wonderful idea!

545
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:35,920
With this, you only have to wear a 
beautiful dress and go to the ball,

546
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:38,180
and even that Siegfried will become 
silly with love.

547
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:39,830
I think I wouldn't mind

548
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,650
marrying Siegfried?

549
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,340
Will that be alright, father?

550
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,280
Of course! Of course!

551
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:48,380
If we do that, Siegfried's love will be yours.

552
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:49,220
That's right.

553
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:52,000
And Odette will also give up and 
become yours.

554
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,160
I'm excited already.

555
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:02,130
Father! We will be very busy tonight.

556
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:03,290
Stop being all lovey dovey,

557
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:04,890
and go to sleep already!

558
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,500
That's right.

559
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,540
I must get some sleep.

560
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,460
Good night!!

561
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:10,480
What is it?

562
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:13,400
I'm pretty sure I saw something like a squirrel.

563
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:15,760
Was it my imagination?

564
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:30,810
A squirrel?

565
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:32,580
And yet,

566
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:34,630
how did you get to such a high place?

567
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,440
Are you lost?

568
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:43,460
What a cute squirrel.

569
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:47,010
That must be it. The words I utter

570
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:48,890
cannot be understood by the Prince.

571
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:50,330
This is going to be a problem.

572
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,080
If you understand what I am saying,

573
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:56,740
tell Odette that regarding tonight's ball,

574
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:57,690
she must,

575
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,810
she must definitely come.

576
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,730
Now. Return to the forest.

577
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,220
What's wrong?

578
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,980
She's late...

579
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:35,770
Even if she asked me to check 
up on Odette's situation,

580
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:37,600
the drawbridge is up.

581
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:45,920
I only have to remove this chain.

582
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:47,100
Alright!

583
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,020
It's no use. It won't move!

584
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:55,630
Oh yeah!

585
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,560
What was that noise just now?

586
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,520
Whew, I'm safe.

587
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:21,920
Wow. It came off.

588
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:42,680
Huh? It got chewed through.

589
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:45,230
Must have been a damn rat.

590
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,320
Calling me a rat...

591
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,670
The sun will soon set.

592
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:04,150
And the ball is not far off.

593
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:05,770
I will also be going out,

594
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:09,950
to have a good look at who Siegfried 
is going to choose.

595
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,950
I'm looking forward to it!

596
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,740
And I had spent so much effort 
bringing it down...

597
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:38,710
Odette...

598
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,210
Prince Siegfried...

599
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:11,450
So, Odette. I'm going to the ball.

600
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:15,400
Tomorrow is our wedding ceremony.

601
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:18,980
Look forward to it, and wait for me patiently.

602
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,960
Hans.

603
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,110
Hans!

604
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,490
It's Margarita!

605
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,090
Margarita!

606
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:41,200
Hans!

607
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,560
Princess Odette is in this room, isn't she?

608
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:59,270
Yes. The problem is how do we open this door?

609
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:01,280
Why are you talking so nonchalantly about it?

610
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:03,160
The ball is about to begin!

611
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,020
Hans! What are you doing?

612
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:06,920
Hurry up, and

613
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,790
put weight on the other side!

614
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:21,870
Hans, are you alright?

615
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:27,640
The door is opening!

616
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,230
And now, the next is Princess Katerina.

617
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:58,510
Congratulations, Prince Siegfried.

618
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,150
Odette.

619
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:12,180
Next is Princess Rosanna.

620
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:16,850
Prince Siegfried,

621
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:19,410
I wish you happy birthday from the 
bottom of my heart.

622
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:21,570
Hurry, Odette.

623
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:44,070
Odette.

624
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,410
How rude!

625
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,810
My name is Francine!

626
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,620
Now, Siegfried.

627
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:57,860
From the ranks of these Princesses,

628
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,840
you must choose the one you like,

629
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:01,860
and dance with her.

630
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:02,660
Mother.

631
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:07,010
I have no intention of marrying 
any of these princesses.

632
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,280
Siegfried!

633
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:09,120
Everyone,

634
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:11,650
tonight's ball is hereby concluded.

635
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:14,070
To the princesses who have travelled so far,

636
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,930
I offer my sincerest apologies.

637
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,040
How can that...

638
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:19,430
Now, please...

639
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:26,720
Odette!

640
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:32,550
Princess Odette, are you alright?

641
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:33,470
Quickly, quickly!

642
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:47,610
I knew you would come, Odette.

643
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:48,840
I am Odil.

644
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:50,550
What did you say?

645
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:51,940
Odil?

646
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:55,390
Yes. I am Odil.

647
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,800
To call me Odette...

648
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,870
But last night, you said...

649
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,040
No.

650
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,470
I clearly told you I was Odil.

651
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:07,580
You must have heard me wrongly.

652
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:10,670
Is that so?

653
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:12,880
Well, what's in a name?

654
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:15,270
Odil, thank you for coming.

655
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:20,760
Who is that,

656
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:23,020
that Princess in black?

657
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:25,970
I don't know, but she is very beautiful.

658
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,140
Siegfried seems to know and like her.

659
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:30,490
I am relieved.

660
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:33,000
Now, maestro. Music!

661
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:33,860
Yes!

662
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:35,600
Music!

663
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:42,640
Wait! Hold it!

664
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:26,990
Stop right there.

665
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,250
How dare you come out here.

666
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:33,480
Well then, I'll show you something good.

667
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:49,530
Take a good look at that!

668
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:11,670
Mother,

669
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,970
and all who are gathered here tonight.

670
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,490
I have an announcement to make.

671
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:19,600
Today,

672
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,370
the day of my coming of age,

673
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:23,730
I wish to welcome Princess Odil to this her new home,

674
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:25,690
as my bride.

675
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:35,740
No! That can't be!

676
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,790
I understand.

677
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:43,310
If you Siegfried, love the Princess 
wholeheartedly,

678
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,160
I will also agree to it.

679
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:46,560
Of course.

680
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,980
I swear, in front of everyone here,

681
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:51,120
to make Princess Odil my queen,

682
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,950
and love her for the rest of my life.

683
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:22,080
You!

684
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,660
Who are you?

685
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:26,190
Siegfried.

686
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,600
At last you have sworn

687
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:30,460
to love my daughter.

688
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:32,560
Y-Your daughter?

689
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:36,540
Don't tell me...you are Rothbart?

690
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,000
That is right.

691
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:40,620
With this, Odette is mine!

692
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:42,800
Odette!

693
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,580
Then you are...

694
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:47,520
I told you, my name is Odil.

695
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:50,690
It's a bit too late to be surprised now.

696
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:53,890
Because you have sworn to make 
me your queen,

697
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:56,500
and to love me for the rest of your life.

698
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:57,450
Odette!

699
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,710
Please forgive me, Odette!

700
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,710
No matter how much you cry now,

701
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,680
Odette is mine.

702
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:12,090
Ohh, have you awoken, Odette?

703
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,180
Goodbye, Prince Siegfried!

704
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:16,480
Odette!

705
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:17,920
Wait, Odette!

706
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,370
Let's go home, Odette!

707
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,210
Odette!

708
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:42,740
You are mine now!

709
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:46,900
Well done, Odil!

710
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:49,340
Odette!!!!

711
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:18,740
Please wait, Siegfried!

712
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:19,570
Mother!

713
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:21,800
Your opponent is a wizard.

714
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:24,200
You don't know what sort of danger
 you are putting yourself in.

715
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:26,190
Please forgive me, Mother.

716
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:26,960
I...

717
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:28,740
Even if I have to forfeit my life,

718
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:30,210
I must rescue Odette!

719
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:33,360
From today, you are the master of 
this castle.

720
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:35,320
I will not allow you to engage in 
reckless behaviour.

721
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:36,630
Mother...

722
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:37,910
Please forgive me.

723
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:39,730
S-Siegfried!

724
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:42,400
Siegfried!

725
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:44,480
Siegfried!!

726
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:38,270
It's alright, it's alright. 
Cry as much as you want.

727
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:41,300
But you must give up some day.

728
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:44,430
Odette, I am waiting for you,

729
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:47,540
waiting for the day you will come 
back to me and open your heart...

730
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:50,280
Prince Siegfried!

731
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:54,950
That damned youngster!

732
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:56,250
I will not tolerate this any more!

733
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,900
Let's get on with it, Rothbart!

734
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:16,140
Interesting. You are saying you 
want to fight me?

735
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:18,440
I have come to save Odette!

736
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:21,580
Who do you think I am?

737
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:24,340
I happen to be the great wizard
 Lord Rothbart!

738
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:30,670
Damn you!

739
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,040
No, Prince Siegfried!

740
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:47,720
Odette!

741
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:50,100
Please run away, Prince Siegfried!

742
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,740
At this rate, you will be killed!

743
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:54,280
Don't worry.

744
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:57,030
He won't kill Siegfried.

745
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:58,850
He will just drive him away.

746
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:00,240
Isn't that right, father?

747
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:02,530
Yes, I got it.

748
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:05,560
You have Siegfried's vow of love,

749
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:07,050
so I won't kill him.

750
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:09,610
He's your cute husband, isn't he?

751
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,800
Father, be careful.

752
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:14,320
Odette is headed your way.

753
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:15,660
What?

754
01:04:16,010 --> 01:04:17,780
That damn Odette!

755
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:24,640
It's the Prince!

756
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:28,750
Where is she?

757
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:30,300
Where are you, Odette?

758
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:35,110
Odette!

759
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:47,190
Don't do it, Odette.

760
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,120
You know what will happen if you disobey me.

761
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:52,390
Hurry and run away, Prince Siegfried.

762
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:53,360
Odette!

763
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:55,570
You should be the one running away.

764
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:58,420
I have come here
for the sole purpose of 
destroying Rothbart.

765
01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:02,970
Siegfried, if you should take that 
attitude with me,

766
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:04,740
even if you are Odil's husband,

767
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:07,740
I can't let you leave this place alive.

768
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:14,950
Prince Siegfried! Come in here!

769
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:21,260
How interesting.

770
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:26,820
Come at me, brat!

771
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,290
Hans, I beg you.

772
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,340
If you wish to marry me,

773
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,910
Go help the Prince!

774
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:44,850
Alright! I'll do it!

775
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:47,400
Go for it!

776
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:02,960
Now, Siegfried. Go home, go back 
home before you get hurt.

777
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,590
A squirrel, eh!

778
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,460
You noisy creature!

779
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:25,400
Hans!

780
01:06:25,610 --> 01:06:28,480
My Hans!

781
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,230
They're still going at it!

782
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:39,940
Now, now. It's useless, no matter 
how much you try to run.

783
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,770
What a troublesome son-in-law!

784
01:06:46,590 --> 01:06:48,410
Now, how about it, my son-in-law?

785
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:51,020
If you will return to your castle 
and live with Odil,

786
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,600
I will spare your life.

787
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:56,400
Who the hell would want a wizard's 
daughter?

788
01:06:58,090 --> 01:06:59,730
What did you say?

789
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:01,400
Father, it doesn't matter anymore!

790
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:02,880
Kill Siegfried!

791
01:07:02,950 --> 01:07:03,960
Kill him!

792
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:06,150
Right then! I'll kill him!

793
01:07:06,350 --> 01:07:08,980
I'll kill him! Like so!

794
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:15,490
Prince Siegfried!

795
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:24,590
Prince Siegfried!

796
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:31,480


797
01:07:32,310 --> 01:07:33,940
Odette, look at this!

798
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:35,280
Stop!

799
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:37,160
Don't kill Prince Siegfried!

800
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:41,040
Do you want to save him?

801
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:42,830
Please, let him go!

802
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:44,410
No, father.

803
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:45,710
Hurry and kill him!

804
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:47,500
Don't rush it, Odil.

805
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:50,470
If I wanted to kill him, 
I could do so at any time.

806
01:07:50,870 --> 01:07:52,240
In any case, Odette.

807
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:55,130
If you want to save this man,

808
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:57,260
say you will become my wife.

809
01:07:58,280 --> 01:07:59,530
How about it, Odette?

810
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:02,770
Will you give me your heart,

811
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:05,270
will you swear your love to me?

812
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:06,900
You can't do it, Odette!

813
01:08:07,070 --> 01:08:09,010
It doesn't matter what happens to me,

814
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:11,570
but you mustn't give Rothbart your heart!

815
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:13,800
Come Odette,

816
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:14,740
what should I do?

817
01:08:14,770 --> 01:08:16,120
Is it alright to kill him?

818
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:17,070
Wait!

819
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,260
Don't do it, Odette!

820
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:20,810
Now...

821
01:08:20,850 --> 01:08:23,530
will you swear to love me from 
the bottom of your heart?

822
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:26,730
Or will I kill Siegfried?

823
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:28,370
Come now, say it!

824
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:31,320
Odette, I don't want my life!

825
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:34,460
Now, Odette!

826
01:08:36,830 --> 01:08:38,360
I...

827
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:40,820
sincerely...Rothbart...

828
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:41,900
Stop it!!

829
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:40,760
Huh?

830
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:11,820
Yay! Hans has returned to normal! 
He has returned!

831
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:46,460
Prince Siegfried?

832
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:58,860
Odette!

833
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:01,260
Prince Siegfried!

834
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:07,270
The power of their love

835
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:09,760
finally conquered the magic of Rothbart.

836
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:14,300
Hans, just as the Prince loves 
Princess Odette,

837
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:15,800
will you love me?

838
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:19,290
Hans

839
01:12:09,430 --> 01:12:14,080
The lake at dawn

840
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:18,040
Awakening from dreams

841
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:22,610
The dazzling spring

842
01:12:23,210 --> 01:12:27,640
Is reflected

843
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:33,750
Ah, when the pair of you are loudly

844
01:12:33,940 --> 01:12:37,860
Calling out to each other

845
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:47,270
The things of the forest will 
shine brilliantly

846
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:53,030
The ripples glitter

847
01:12:53,030 --> 01:12:58,310
Glitter and blaze

848
01:12:58,310 --> 01:13:02,890
Even the truth rejoices

849
01:13:02,890 --> 01:13:08,060
And continues the song

850
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:18,060
Always...always

851
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:25,790
The sunlight on the lake.

852
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:32,330
The ripples glitter

853
01:13:32,330 --> 01:13:37,770
If they were glittering fairies

854
01:13:37,930 --> 01:13:47,690
Continually telling of the truth.

855
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:57,030
Always...always...

856
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:06,240
The sunlight on the lake

857
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:11,240
