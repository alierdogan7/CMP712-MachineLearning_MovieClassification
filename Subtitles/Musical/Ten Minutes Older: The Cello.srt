I want wine!

00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,840
Wine?

63
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,840

00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,840

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,440
But.....
Don't touch me!

78
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,120
What happened to you?

79
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,320
What?

80
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,520
Forget it

81
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,840
You ned tos sleep.

82
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,840
How about you going to bed?

83
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,720
Take a rest.

84
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,840
Sleep....

85
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,880
Then you'll feel better...

86
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,840
Sit down. Let me help you take off the shoes,
just lie down in the bed...

87
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,360
Sleep.

88
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,080
Have a sweet dream

89
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,840
I wanna drink.
Lie down, don't move.

90
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,600
No, no no!

91
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,840
Lie down, don't go.
Let go of me

92
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,840

93
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,120
Let go of me, let go!

00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,840
What's wrong with you, tonight is our...

95
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,840
Let go! Get out...

96
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,840

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,720

00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,440
Let go!

99
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,840
What's wrong?

100
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,720
Gábor, what's wrong with you?

101
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,160
Hello! Please come here! There's an accident here....

102

Mrs. Máté

108

Anything, anybody....

110
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,400
I don't discuss anything with anybody

111
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,600
Calm down.

112
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,680
You don't talk about anything with anybody...

113
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,960
Are they coming?

114
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,360

115
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,840

00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,720
He won't die

119
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,720
He won't die

120
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,480
Come on!

121
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,480
Come on!

122
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,200
He won't die, right?

123
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,840
Bring his coat.

124
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,720
He won't die.

125
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,720
He won't die.

126
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,640
Is it here? Yes.
A lady stabbed her husband.

127
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,840
Is it her? Yes

128
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,400
Lady! Please come here!

129
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Is it you that you stabbed your husband?

130
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,840
Please come with us, we need to make some notes.

131
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,840
No! I've to look after my husband!

132
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,920
No, no! Let go!

133
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,840
The crime scene is here, right? Yes.

134
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,360
Go in.

135
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,160
No.

136
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,440
In. No!

137
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,840
What's wrong with you? You must cooperate with us.

138
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,840
Hey? Help her in.

139
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,360
Go in.

140
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,840
No one has ever noticed.

141
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,400
Is there someone that noticed he smoked?

142
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,840
Facing Nancy.

143
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,840
There were many times in the past.

144
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,320
I wanted to come here.

145
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,840
Came to France, because...

146
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,480
...it has a good impression on my heart, and I don't know.

147
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,320
It's just like a love.

148
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,840
Yes, I can understand.

149
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,840
But to this...

150
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,840
...it is not easy...

151
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,840
...to describe within several words.

152
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,800
Not the things on the surface.

153
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,840
It's hard to explain.

154
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,840
But now you are stepping to the hope.

155
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,840
At this moment what are you thinking?

156
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,840
This is very complex.

157
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,120
Becasue it is pale to use the words to express that.

158
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,720
Because something deposits...

159
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,760
...under the surface and it cannot be through.

160
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,080
But my feeling is totally exciting.

161
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,840
The excitement in the travel.

162
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,680
From one place to the other.

163
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,840
Though these travels make me a little tired,

164
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,360
yet I have the feeling of satisfaction.

165
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,840
It's the normal human feelings.

166
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,840
And including the travel in the time.

167
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,680
From one space to the other.

168
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,840
This deed, it's just the happiness that the life journey brings.

169
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,840
So you can do whatever you like.

170
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,840
This is a kind of extrication of the thought.

171
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,200
It's the satisfaction in the process.

172
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,840
It's beyond the form of the surface.

173
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,280
When you are in a strange environment,

174
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,840
Can you have that kind of feelings?

175
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,280
Can you feel strange?

176
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,840
First, you centainly will have that feeling.

177
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,000
But when the time let you enjoy yourself slowly...

178
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,840
...you will forget something.

179
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,840
You won't separate yourself from that environment.

180
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,840
This is your gain whenm you come to the strange place.

181
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,520
And then, you will feel..

182
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,840
...that's a "stable point".

183
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,840
I know it's hard to describe that.

184
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,840
But the fact is just like this.

185
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,840
When you do something, the feeling of you...

186
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,840
...lies in the process.

187
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,840
It's only you who can realize that.

188
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,840
The other people cannot replace your feeling.

189
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,840
But it truly exists and there's no need to prove that.

190
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,040
You have more words on this aspect than the others.

191
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,720
These words are very serious.

192
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,840
How about the time-space change in the life?

193
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:20,840
I like this feeling.

194
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,360
France gives me so many feelings, and not merely France.

195
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,840
Because they make me know myself.

196
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,760
Anf I can choose my suitable space after that.

197
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,840
I also agree with that point.

198
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,840
Do you have muck ecperience? Because...

199
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,840
That depends on the age, doesn't that?

200
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,360
Yes, if you try to keep with one thing.

201
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,760
For instance on the aspect of learning French.

202
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,600
I just pratice by speaking.

203
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,320
French is the one that you need the courage to express.

204
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,840
You must have the courage to say it out, whether it is good or bad.

205
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,000
There are many things like that, just keep trying.

206
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,800
To try and you will gain much.

207
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,920
This is where the interest lies.

208
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,840
No matter how long you have kept trying...

209
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,840
...something is not satisfactory, and you must force yourself.

210
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,200
That is different with what you said.

211
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,960
That makes me sad... I don't know how to express.

212
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,520
Is there any effective ways to solve that?

213
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,480
Because I have some experience like that.

214
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,840
Of course.

215
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,840
The key to solve these things is themselves.

216
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,840
What the others say is just the indirect experience.

217
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,480
That is not something uncessary that I mentioned just now.

218
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,920
It's connected.

219
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,840
In fact it is also another way.

220
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,840
Transfer between two different space.

221
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,520
Even change the identity.

222
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,600
To release one's own heart.

223
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,840
When you are in a space, you just escape from the other.

224
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,160
And it gives you time to solve that.

225
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,560
Because to the space you are not connected.

226
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,120
This is my thought.

227
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,440
I think that would help.

228
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,840
So I did this.

229
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,840
One time in a space and change the time.

230
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,400
You come to another space and feel good.

231
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,400
The experience of life.

232
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,840
I maybe understand something.

233
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,840
It showed me some resonance.

234
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,840
Did you have some bad time?

235
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,680
Of course, and for instance.

236
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,840
There are some accidents that make you wordless.

237
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,840
It's a complete abnormal track.

238
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,280
Sometimes you can call that abnormity.

239
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,840
You have to accept that.

240
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,840
Because that cannot happen only once or two times, and you cannot avoid that.

241
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,400
So you must find the key and solve that.

242
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Especially when it was severe you must be patient.

243
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,840
Of course, it is not that easy.

244
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,560
I feel your words are a little theoretical.

245
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,840
But the fact is just like this, and you will feel that actually.

246
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,840
That's the same thing, perhaps.

247
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,400
Maybe they are just my personal summary.

248
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,560
That's my experience, and they truly exist.

249
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:33,040
Though it is a little theoretical.

250
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,840
I should say it is suitable, because...

251
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,560
...the experience of everyone are the same.

252
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,520
This makes the communication between people lack of limits.

253
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,840
The two completely different worlds always have something in common.

254
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,440
Because it is necessary.

255
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,040
This is necessary in large scales.

256
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,640
Though it is very delicate, yet it's actual.

257
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,280
Yes, you are right. And what's more...

258
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,840
...many things are beyond their imagination, right?

259
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,840
Yes, for instance, acception and rejection, rejection and acception.

260
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,840
Not merely the surface meaning.

261
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,200
Sometimes, perhapse.

262
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,120
It's just opposite.

263
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,840
Or some hint.

264
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,840
And there are genius in this crowd.

265
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,840
There are some things that only genius can complete.

266
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,840
This is correct.

267
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,560
But there are some other aspects of them...

268
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,280
...under the surface.

269
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,840
According to what you said strangeness has some other aspects.

270
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,840
The aspect that is familiar.

271
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,400
Something enthusiastic.

272
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,040
We welcome you and that's the lot.

273
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,840
This is true.

274
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,840
But may not be completely possible.

275
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,360
Because in my opinion I need something.

276
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Something mystic.

277
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,440
This is the normal life.

278
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,840
There are some curiosity there.

279
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,160
So I cannot deny its strange aspect.

280
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,600
Especially in such a place.

281
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,840
My feeling is pretty right, OK?

282
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,840
I think it no problem here.

283
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,840
I also think so, no problem.

284
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,840
And you can enjoy that very much.

285
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,600
Yes, but that's not enough.

286
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:18,520
I think that's a process full of familiary and strangeness.

287
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,840
All is in the process.

288
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,920
All kinds of flavor in the life.

289
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,840
I always feel happy about that.

290
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,360
What I can do is about the regulations.

291
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,840
No, you won't.

292
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
That will make you lose interest.

293
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,840
Are we on the stop?

294
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:04,840
We will get to the stop soon, the final stop? Ten miniutes later.

295
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,840
Yes? What a good talk you have.

296
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,400
But time can finish this, is that right?

297
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,160
During the time....

298
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:01,840
Why light the torch?

299
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,280
The noon of darkness.

300
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:11,240
Maybe this world lacks of brightness.

301
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,680
It needs the torch to light.

302
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,760
Drive something away and bring something back.

303
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,680
Especially facing the crowd.

304
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,680
I always think it necessary.

305
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,160
The last minutes...

306
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,960
...of the youth.

307
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,840
Among these several guns...

308
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,840
...which one should I choose?

309
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:55,400
I want to finish someone's life with it.

310
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,840
I really don't know.

311
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,840
Whether he will like this.

312
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,840
I want you to choose.

313
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:08,040
You like to die slowly or quickly?

314
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,720
Come on now.

315
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,840
Mom.

316
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,400
He just left like that.

317
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,400
Taking with everything.

318
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:27,840
Oh, Paula, I don't know whether you're fearful.

319
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,720
The courage.

320
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,040
The last minutes.

321
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,720
The thought.

322
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,040
The last minutes.

323
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,840
"With the thought I'm happy"

324
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:23,800
The happy thought and the happiness of thought.

325
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,240
Why?

326
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,240
Maybe I will betray this "happiness".

327
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,840
When I betray the thought,

328
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,520
I think I cannot possess this "happiness".

329
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,840
Oh, so many books have been treated as the rubbish.

330
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,840
Some of them...

331
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,520
...seem to be pretty new.

332
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:01,840
Think it clearly that whether to give up all or not.

333
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,800
Once you give up it will never come back again.

334
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,800
Rubbish car is its end-result.

335
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,160
The last minutes...

336
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,760
...of memory.

337
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,280
It will never expire.

338
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,520
The love.

339
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:43,840
Tell me you won't leave.

340
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,040
The last minutes.

341
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,840
We will have the smile.

342
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,840
OK, the past and all the past, stop now.

343
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,840
This is our finale, bye.

344
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,840
I always have nothing, nothing.

345
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,840
Before you tell me I know I have nothing.

346
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,840
But I hoe that you won't become like that.

347
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,840
We cannot do this and this is our destiny.

348
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,760
The silent...

349
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,440
...and the last minutes.

350
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,840
They are here, aren't they?

351
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,080
What's the number?

352
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,080
What's the number?

353
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,120
They are in your hand, aren't they?

354
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,080
What's the number?

355
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,160
The last minutes...

356
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,840
...of the story.

357
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,840
We are lead upward.

358
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:34,840
That place is full of brightness and effulgence.

359
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,840
I know agian that I have the new desire.

360
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,840
Something rise from my heart.

361
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:47,240
Just like the horse that steps on the road first time.

362
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:53,520
To be against you I will taste the bitter.

363
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,720
The new way.

364
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,600
Oh, death.

365
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,040
She left forever.

366
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,040
She left forever.

367
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,480
She left forever, I know, she left alone.

368
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:23,360
I know that someone left means he died.

369
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,880
The horrible...

370
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,280
and the last minutes.

371
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,840
Cruety, war.

372
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,840
But it's the vision we often see and the horror just lies in it.

373
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,840
They seem not to shock the people.

374
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,720
But they make me so shocking.

375
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:11,360
If I can escape and reject, if I can...

376
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:17,480
I would rather believe this is just fake.

377
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,160
The last minutes...

378
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,080
...of the forever.

379
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,520
Immortal.

380
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,160
The last minutes...

381
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,960
...of the movie.

382
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,880
The last imago.

383
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,880
The last imago.

384
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,840
He said, dark night.

385
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,840
She said, dark night.

386
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,320
They said, dark night.

387
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,480
The End.
