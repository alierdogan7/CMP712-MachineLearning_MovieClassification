1
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,194
Through the snow
and sleet and hail...

2
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,517
through the blizzard,
through the gale...

3
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,592
through the wind
and through the rain...

4
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,473
over mountain, over plain...

5
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,751
through the blinding
lightning flash...

6
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,190
and the mighty thunder crash...

7
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,313
ever faithful, ever true...

8
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,595
nothing stops him.

9
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,676
He'll get through.

10
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,311
Look out for Mr Stork
that persevering chap

11
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,790
He'll come along and drop
a bundle in your lap

12
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,031
You may be poor or rich
It doesn't matter which

13
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,550
Millionaires, they get theirs
like the butcher and the baker

14
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,030
So look out for Mr Stork
and let me tell you, friend

15
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,999
Don't try to get away
He'll find you in the end

16
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,112
He'll spot you out in China
or he'll fly to County Cork

17
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,471
So you'd better look out
for Mr Stork

18
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,390
Look out for Mr Stork
He's got you on his list

19
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,035
And when he comes around
it's useless to resist

20
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,556
Remember those quintuplets
and the woman in the shoe

21
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,871
Maybe he's got his eye on you

22
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,435
All aboard! All aboard!

23
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,149
All aboard! Let's go!

24
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,394
Casey Junior's comin' down the track

25
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,189
Comin' down the track
with a smoky stack

26
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,880
Hear him puffin'
comin' round the hill

27
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,675
Casey's here to thrill
every Jack and Jill

28
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,792
Every time his funny
little whistle sounds

29
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,992
Everybody hurries
to the circus grounds

30
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,634
Time for lemonade and Cracker Jack

31
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,871
Casey Junior's back
Casey Junior's back

32
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,550
Oh. My, my.

33
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,878
Now let me see.

34
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,992
Must be right around here somewhere.

35
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,310
I hope.
Ah, watch it there.

36
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,799
On the treetop

37
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,749
Where are we here?
Oh, here.

38
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,351
Highway 61, four miles
to the gas station

39
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,029
Turn left
Da-da da-da-da de

40
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,555
Ah. That must be it.

41
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,634
Well, little fella,
let's get goin'.

42
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,839
Mrs Jumbo. Oh, Mrs Jumbo.

43
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,791
Calling Mrs Jumbo.

44
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,717
Mrs Jumbo?

45
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,237
Oh. My.

46
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,914
Mrs Jumbo!

47
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,031
- Oh, where's that Mrs Jum--
- Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!

48
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,639
- Over here.
- This way, boy.

49
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,352
- In here! ln here!
- Yoo-hoo!

50
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,995
- This is the place.
- Whew! At last.

51
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,237
Which one of you ladies
is expecting?

52
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,113
- Hmph! Not me.
- The very idea.

53
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,879
Certainly not.
Over there, of course.

54
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,150
Yes, of course.
Right over there.

55
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,437
Oh. Of course.

56
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,711
Here is a baby with eyes of blue...

57
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,115
straight from heaven
right to you.

58
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,071
Or: Straight from heaven
up above...

59
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,509
here is a baby for you to love.

60
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,554
Sign here, please.

61
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,878
Uh, yeah. Well-- Oh. Mrs Jumbo.

62
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,989
Uh, one moment, please.
This is still part of the service.

63
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,234
Happy Birthday to you

64
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,272
Ah, Happy Birthday to you

65
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,636
Ah, Happy Birthday, dear

66
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,678
Ah, dear
Dear me. What's his name?

67
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,638
Jumbo. Junior.

68
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,274
Oh. Jumbo Junior, huh?
Ahem. Jumbo Junior.

69
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,399
Happy Birthday, dear Jumbo Junior

70
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,636
Happy Birthday

71
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,150
To-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo

72
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,555
You

73
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,273
- Oh, do hurry, dear.
- I'm on pins and needles.

74
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,316
- Isn't it thrilling?
- I'm all a-flutter.

75
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,955
Ah, this is a proud, proud day.

76
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,038
- Well, hurry and open it, dearie.
- I'm just dying to see.

77
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,710
- Oh!
- Look at him!

78
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,268
Look at him!

79
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,436
Oh, what a-- Oh, look!

80
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,633
- Oh, you sweet little thing.
- He is cute, isn't he?

81
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,518
Oh, he is a darling little baby.

82
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,115
Adorable. Simply adorable.

83
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,152
Did you ever see
anything so cunning?

84
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,271
Isn't he a darling!

85
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,393
Kootchy, kootchy, kootchy,
kootchy, kootchy, kootchy.

86
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,436
- Oh!
- Oh!

87
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,518
- Is it possible?
- Isn't there some mistake?

88
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,313
Just look at those, those--

89
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,039
E-A-R-S.

90
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,630
Those what? Oh, ears!

91
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,309
These! Aren't they funny? Oh!

92
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,749
- Oh, my goodness.
- What a temper.

93
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,512
Oh, what did I do?
Well, tell me.

94
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,636
- Did I say anything?
- Perfectly harmless remark.

95
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,273
I just said that they're funny,
and they are funny.

96
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,470
- They certainly are.
- After all, who cares...

97
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,795
about her precious little Jumbo?

98
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,276
Jumbo? You mean Dumbo.

99
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,391
Dumbo.

100
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,674
- Dumbo, I say.
- That's good.

101
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,758
- Dumbo! That's good.
- Dumbo.

102
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,310
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can. I think I can.

103
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,195
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can.

104
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,193
I thought I could. I thought I could.
I thought I could. I thought I could.

105
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,113
Whoo-woo!

106
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,989
Hike, ugh, hike, ugh
hike, ugh, hike

107
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,116
We work all day
We work all night

108
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,992
We never learned
to read or write

109
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,351
We're happy-hearted roustabouts

110
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,150
Hike, ugh, hike, ugh
hike, ugh, hike

111
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,635
When other folks have gone to bed

112
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,591
We slave until we're almost dead

113
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,831
We're happy-hearted roustabouts

114
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,954
Hike, ugh, hike, ugh
hike, ugh, hike

115
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,116
We don't know when
we get our pay

116
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,800
And when we do
we throw our pay away

117
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,390
When we get our pay
we throw our money all away

118
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,471
We get our pay when children say

119
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,074
With happy hearts
It's circus day today

120
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,795
Then we get our pay
just watching kids on circus day

121
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,799
Muscles aching
Back near breaking

122
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,390
Eggs and bacon's what we need

123
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,278
- Yes, sir!
- Boss man houndin'

124
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,316
Keep on poundin'

125
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,069
For your bread and keep

126
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,395
There ain't no letup

127
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,511
Got to set up

128
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,591
Pull that canvas

129
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,716
Drive that stake

130
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,753
Want to doze off
Get them clothes off

131
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,078
But must keep awake

132
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,034
Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave!
Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave!

133
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,438
Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave!
Hep! Heave! Hep!

134
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,471
Swing that sledge
Sing that song

135
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,397
Work and laugh
the whole night long

136
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,512
You happy-hearted roustabouts

137
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,910
Pullin', poundin'
tyin', groundin'

138
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,951
Big top roundin' into shape

139
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,792
Keep on workin'
Stop that shirkin'

140
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,150
Grab that rope, you hairy ape

141
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,231
Poundin', poundin'

142
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,276
Poundin', poundin'

143
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,114
Oh

144
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,431
Jostling and juggling.
Fifteen minutes!

145
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,511
Step right up and get your tickets.
Hurry, hurry now.

146
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,598
Hurry to the big sideshow.
That's why you go under the big top.

147
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,315
Fifteen big attractions that you
can't see anywhere else in the world!

148
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,715
The greatest collection
in the entire world.

149
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,197
And the greatest comedies are featured
and assembled for your entertainment.

150
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,029
Ain't that the funniest thing
you ever saw? Look at his ears.

151
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,788
Hey, guys, lookit!
Smitty's an elephant!

152
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,838
- Aw, let me see!
- Boo!

153
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,520
- You can't hide him from us.
- Yeah, his ears are still stickin' out.

154
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,113
- Come on!
- We wanna see him!

155
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,998
- We wanna laugh.
- Sure, that's what we came for.

156
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,677
Hey, the biggest slingshot
in the world.

157
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,830
- Hey! Cut that out!
- Hey, let's get out of here.

158
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,635
- You're hurting me! Help!
- Here, you! What's going on?

159
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,671
Down. Mrs Jumbo, down!

160
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,473
Surround her. Tie her down.

161
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,990
Get down!

162
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,878
Calm down! Tie her down!

163
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,631
Darling, it was so funny.

164
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,876
Oh, my dear, can you bear it?

165
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,595
When she doused the ringmaster,
I just thought I'd die.

166
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,359
Well, personally, I think
she went a bit too far.

167
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,749
After all, one mustn't forget
one is a lady.

168
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,432
- Oh, you're right, dear. Yes.
- Oh, that's very true.

169
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,790
Oh, well, I suppose
that's mother love.

170
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,150
But it's certainly no excuse
for what she did.

171
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,118
Mother love might cover
a multitude of sins.

172
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,515
It's true, my dear,
and she has such a streak in--

173
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,517
A guy can't eat in peace.

174
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,477
Yes, but mother love does--

175
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,716
Gab, gab, gab.
Always gossipin'.

176
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,076
Girls, girls! Listen!

177
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,435
Have I got a trunk full of dirt.

178
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,273
- Well, darling, tell us all.
- Go on, go on.

179
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,791
Well, I heard today that they have
put her in solitary confinement.

180
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,791
- No!
- You don't mean it!

181
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,309
Oh, how awful for her!

182
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,039
Well, l-l must say,
l-l don't blame her for anything.

183
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,755
You're absolutely right.
It's all the fault of that little--

184
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,758
F-R-E-A-K.

185
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,112
Yes, him with those ears
that only a mother could love.

186
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,231
What's the matter with his ears?

187
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,312
I don't see nothin' wrong with 'em.
I think they're cute.

188
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,796
Ladies, ladies!
It's no laughing matter at all.

189
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,036
Oh. Oh, she's right, girls.

190
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,472
Don't forget that we elephants
have always walked with dignity.

191
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,835
His disgrace is our own shame.

192
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,837
- Yes, that's true. That's very true.
- Oh, indeed it is.

193
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,391
Well, frankly, I wouldn't eat
at the same bale of hay with him.

194
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,748
- No. Right.
- Me either, dearie.

195
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,474
-I should say.
-Nor l. That's just how I feel about it.

196
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,869
Here he comes now.

197
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,475
Hmm. Pretend you don't see him.

198
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,989
Shh.

199
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,595
How do ya like that?
Givin' him the cold shoulder.

200
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,838
Poor little guy.

201
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:35,038
There he goes,
without a friend in the world.

202
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,757
Nobody to turn to.

203
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,791
Oh, I'll do somethin' about this.

204
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,471
A mouse!

205
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,391
So ya like to pick
on little guys, huh?

206
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,994
Well, why don't you pick on me?

207
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,476
A proud race.

208
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,716
Overstuffed hay bags!

209
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,875
Boo!

210
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,468
Still afraid of a mouse.

211
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,632
Ho-ho, boy.
Wait'll I tell the little guy.

212
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,354
Where is he? Oh. Hey, Dumbo.

213
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,994
You can come out now.

214
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,351
Golly. Maybe I scared him too.

215
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,596
Look, Dumbo. I'm your friend.

216
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,511
Come on out, won't ya?

217
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,432
You're not really afraid
of little me, are ya?

218
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,270
Ya are?
Must've overdid it in there.

219
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,954
Don't know my own strength sometimes.

220
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,834
Dumbo. Look what I got for ya.

221
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,632
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
Ya gotta come out first.

222
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,715
Too bad ya don't trust me,
'cause I thought...

223
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,436
uh, well, you-- you and me, uh, we
might get your mother out of the clink.

224
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,313
Oh, but I guess you wouldn't
be interested. So long, Dumbo.

225
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,669
Well, that's more like it.

226
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,274
Ya know, your ma ain't crazy.

227
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,590
She's just broken-hearted.

228
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,349
It ain't nobody's fault
you got them big ears.

229
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,597
Uh-oh. Boy, I stepped in it that time.

230
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,430
Aw, gee, Dumbo.
I think your ears are beautiful.

231
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,314
Sure. As a matter of fact,
I think they're very decorative.

232
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,154
You know, lots of people
with big ears are famous.

233
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,391
Ho-ho, boy.
All we gotta do is build an act.

234
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,438
Make ya a star. A headliner!

235
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,670
Dumbo the Great!

236
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,274
Uh-oh. The great what?

237
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,039
Ya know, Dumbo,
we gotta get an idea.

238
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,874
Not just any idea.
Something colossal, like, uh--

239
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,549
Have I got an idea!
What an idea!

240
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,790
Huh. He never had an idea
in his life.

241
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,998
Just visualize:
One elephant climbs up...

242
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,192
on top of another elephant
until finally...

243
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,436
all 17 elephants...

244
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,791
have constructed
an enormous pyramid...

245
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,876
of pachyderms.

246
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,355
I step out.

247
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,271
I blow the whistle.

248
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,715
- Yeah.
- The trumpets are trumpeting.

249
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,552
- Yeah.
- And now...

250
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,875
comes the climax!

251
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,669
Yeah? What is the climax?

252
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,115
Hmm. I don't know.

253
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,430
I knew he never had nothin'.

254
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,313
Well, maybe it comes to me...

255
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,910
in a vision while I dream.

256
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,309
- Good night, Joe.
- Good night, Boss.

257
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,237
Climax.

258
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,229
Climax! Dumbo, you're a climax.

259
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,478
I'll be back in a minute.
I'm gonna take care of your future.

260
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,593
I am the voice
of your subconscious mind.

261
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,074
Your inspiration.

262
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,594
Now, concentrate.

263
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,152
Remember?
Your pyramid of elephants...

264
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,271
are standing in the ring
waitin' for a climax.

265
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,075
- Climax.
- You are now getting that climax.

266
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,037
- Climax.
- How's the reception?

267
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,197
Comin' through okay? Good.

268
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,629
Suddenly, from the sidelines,
comes your climax.

269
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,990
- Climax.
- Gallopin' across the arena.

270
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,389
- Arena.
- He jumps from a springboard...

271
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,873
to a platform.

272
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,072
At the very pinnacle of your pyramid,
he waves a flag...

273
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,792
for a glorious finish!

274
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,708
- Finish?
- And who is your climax?

275
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,592
The little elephant
with the big ears!

276
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,874
The world's mightiest
midget mastodon! Dumbo!

277
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,797
What?

278
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,275
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.

279
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,510
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.

280
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,717
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.

281
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,717
I got it! I got it!

282
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,878
Ladies and gentlemen...

283
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,231
we will now present
for your entertainment...

284
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,511
the most stupendous, magnificent...

285
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,791
super-colossal spectacle.

286
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,115
On this tiny...

287
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,118
Iittle, insignificant ball...

288
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,316
we will construct for you...

289
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,149
a pyramid, not of wood,
not of stone...

290
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,113
To hear him talk,
you'd think he was going to do it.

291
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,919
- but a living, breathing...
- The stuffed shirt.

292
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,828
pyramid of ponderous, pulsating...

293
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:55,152
pulchritudinous pachyderms!

294
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,396
I give you the elephants.

295
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,637
Aren't we a bit clumsy?

296
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,513
Gaining a little weight,
aren't you, honey?

297
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,837
You're no cream puff
yourself, dearie.

298
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,838
Quiet up there.
Tend to your work, girls.

299
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,874
Take your foot out of my eye,
clumsy ox.

300
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,551
Steady, girls.

301
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,915
Boy, that was a close one.

302
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,356
They're almost ready now, Dumbo.
Don't forget to wave that flag.

303
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,233
Okay, okay.
Don't wave it no more. I saw ya.

304
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,874
Now, look. All ya gotta do
is run out, see?

305
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,871
Jump on the springboard.

306
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,629
All right, now show me
just how you're gonna do it.

307
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,678
That's it. Attaboy.
That's the stuff. Come on.

308
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,075
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! Dumbo!

309
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,594
Oh, those ears.
We gotta do somethin', quick.

310
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,870
Ladies and gentlemen...

311
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,793
you have now seen the impossible...

312
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,189
accomplished in front of your faces.

313
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,794
Seven jungle giants...

314
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,717
each one weighing not--

315
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,319
That windbag!

316
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,159
- Why doesn't he come to the point?
- 7,500 pounds!

317
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,390
And now, I present...

318
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,592
the world's smallest
little elephant...

319
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,474
who will spring
from this springboard...

320
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,556
in one spring...

321
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,468
to the top of this pyramid,
waving his little flag...

322
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,711
for a grand climax!

323
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,155
Ladies and gentlemen...

324
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,397
I give you Dumbo!

325
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,995
Go on! Get goin'!

326
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,192
What's the matter with you?
Dumbo! That's your cue!

327
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,231
You're on, Dumbo.

328
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,874
Out of my way, assassin!

329
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,710
- Dear!
- Ohh.

330
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,793
I never thought I'd live
to see the big top fall.

331
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,357
Because of that Dumbo,
I never can show my face there again.

332
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,557
Oh, look at my beautiful tail!

333
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,070
I'd just like to spank
the daylights out of him--

334
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,914
Ah! Oh! Oh! Ohh.

335
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,993
Oh, that won't be necessary, dearie.

336
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,475
They fixed him good.

337
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,391
- What do you mean?
- Wh-What did they do?

338
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,072
- Did they beat him?
- What is it, darling?

339
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,589
- Tell us.
- Come, come. I demand to know.

340
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,679
Oh. Well, they've gone and made him--

341
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,513
- Oh, dear, I just can't say it.
- Out with it!

342
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,313
Made him a clown.

343
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,231
A clown?

344
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,993
- No!
- Yes.

345
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,635
Oh, the shame of it.

346
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,075
Let us take the solemn vow.

347
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,675
From now on, he is no longer...

348
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,597
an elephant.

349
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:58,311
Please! Help me save
my poor baby!

350
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,029
Whoo! Save my child!

Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,837

360
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,598
Thirteen curtain calls.

Yeah, sure brought down

362
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,638
Oh, Mama, did we panic 'em.
Ask me, Joey. Go ahead. Ask me.

363
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,591
You said it.
We rolled 'em in the aisles.

364
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,875
- Boy, oh, boy, what a act.
- Oh, "what a act" is right.

365
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,473
Stupendous, I calls it.

366
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,352
They'll have more respect
for us clowns now.

367
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,431
- Yeah, yeah, you bet.
- Here, boys.

368
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,988
This calls for a real celebration.
Come and get it.

369
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,117
- Poison! Am I thirsty.
- I could use one of them myself.

370
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,037
- This one's on Dumbo.
- Yeah, Dumbo.

371
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,357
- Dumbo!
- Here's plaster in his eyes.

372
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,954
See? They're drinkin'
a toast to ya.

373
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,150
Yeah. You're a big hit.

00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,436
Why, uh, you're terrific.

00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,028
Oh, you're colossal. Stupendous.

Cosy little place, ain't it?

00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,629

00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,473
Someone to see ya.

390
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,278
Baby mine

391
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,638
Don't you cry

392
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,598
Baby mine

393
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,157
Dry your eyes

394
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,708
Rest your head

395
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,796
Close to my heart

396
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,036
Never to part

397
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,759
Baby of mine

398
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,032
Little one

399
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,079
When you play

400
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,993
Don't you mind

401
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:20,113

402
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,839
Let those eyes

403
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,672
Sparkle and shine

404
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,075
Never a tear

405
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,432
Baby of mine

406
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,233
From your head

407
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,032
To your toes

408
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,993
Baby mine

409
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:11,790
You're so sweet
goodness knows

410
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,997
Baby mine

411
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,674

Cute as can be

414
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,276
Baby mine

415
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:33,795
Baby mine

416
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,432
Here ya are.
Pour it in me slipper, Joey.

417
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,393
Boy, I can't get over the way
we rolled 'em in the aisles.

418
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,438
- Just wait'll we hit the big town.
- This gives me an idea.

419
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,875
Let's raise the platform
the elephant jumps off of.

420
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,428
Yeah! lf they laugh
when he jumps 20 feet...

421
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,193
they'll laugh twice as hard
if he jumps 40 feet.

422
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,198
- Yeah, that's right. That's right.
- Simple mathematics.

423
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,716
- Let's make it 80 feet.
- Don't be a piker. 180.

424
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,631
- Make it 300.
- A thousand.

425
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,354
- Yeah, that's good.
- Hey, be careful.

426
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,311
- You'll hurt the little guy.
- Aw, go on.

427
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,159
- Elephants ain't got no feelings.
- No, they're made of rubber.

428
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,919
This idea is sensational.
Let's go tell the boss.

429
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,359
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Come on. Let's go.

430
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,198
Hey, hey!
Let's hit him for a raise.

431
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,430
Yeah, sure.
This is worth real dough.

432
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,990
Oh, we're gonna hit
the big boss for a raise

433
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,510
Yes, we're gonna hit
the big boss for a raise

434
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,349
Oh, we're gonna get more money
'cause we know that we're funny

435
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,512
We're gonna hit
the big boss for a raise

436
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,355
I know how ya feel, Dumbo,
but you gotta pull yourself together.

437
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,228
What would your mother think of ya,
if she saw you crying like this?

438
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,954
Remember, you come of a proud race.

439
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,595
Why you're a-a-a-- a pachyderm...

440
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,517
and pachyderms don't cry.

441
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,552
What's cryin' get ya anyhow?
Nothin' but the hiccups.

442
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,551
There. Ya see?

443
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,559
Well, ain't nothin'
a little water won't cure.

444
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,438
Oops-a-daisy. We'll have ya
fixed up in a jiffy.

445
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,311
Come on.

446
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,876
Here. Take a trunk full.

447
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,711
Listen, little fella.

448
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,439
We may have had a lot
of hard luck up till now...

449
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,637
but you and me is gonna do
big things together.

450
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,429
Hold your breath. Why, your mother's
gonna be so proud of ya.

451
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,078
I'm gonna be proud of ya too.

452
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,152
The whole circus is gonna be proud
of ya. Now, what do ya think of that?

453
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,191
Swallow it.

454
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,635
Ho-ho. They can't keep us down.

455
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,110
Oh, I guess you had
one little one left over.

456
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,471
Dumbo, we'll bounce back so ha--

457
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,353
Hey, what's the matter with you?

458
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,833
What kind of water is this, anyhow?

459
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,593
Balloonies.

460
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,631
Hiya, George.

461
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,679
Whee!

462
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,029
That's a pretty
schstrick schlick.

463
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:45,029
All right. Let's see ya
blow a square one, pal.

464
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,877
Say, that's very, very clever.

465
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:59,437
Now blow a great big one.

466
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,477
That's a pretty sh-- Hey!

467
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,069
Dumbo.

468
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,555
You see what I see?

469
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,114
Look out, look out
Pink elephants on parade

470
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,515
Here they come
Hippity-hoppity

471
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,553
They're here and there
Pink elephants everywhere

472
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,750
Look out, look out

473
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,599
They're walking around the bed
on their head

474
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,478
Clippity-cloppity
Arrayed in braid

475
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,835
Pink elephants on parade

476
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,837
- What'll I do
- What'll I do

477
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,076
What an unusual view

478
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,909
I can stand the sight of worms
and look at microscopic germs

479
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,278
But technicolour pachyderms
is really too much for me

480
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,197
I am not the type to faint

481
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,231
When things are odd
or things are quaint

482
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,276
But seein' things
you know there ain't

483
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,749
Can certainly give you
an awful fright

484
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,713
What a sight
Chase 'em away, chase 'em away

485
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,429
I'm afraid, need your aid
Pink elephants on parade

486
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,829
- Hey, hey, hey
- Pink elephants

487
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,911
Pink elephants

488
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,837
Pink elephants

489
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,151
- Well, looky here, looky here.
- My, my.

490
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,071
Why, this is most irregular.

491
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,628
Well, I just can't believe my eyes.

492
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:04,396
- They ain't dead, is they?
- No. Dead people don't snore.

493
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,675
Or do they?

494
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,151
Uh, wh-what's all the ruckus?
Come on.

495
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,199
Step aside, brother.
Uh, what's cookin' 'round here?

496
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,271
What's the good news?
What's fryin', boy?

497
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:20,114
- Just look down there, brother.
- And prepare yourself for a shock.

498
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,511
- Well, hush my beak!
- Go ahead. Wake 'em up, brother.

499
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,636
Yeah. Find out
what they're doin' up here.

500
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,711
- Yeah.
- And "axe" them what they want.

501
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,070
Okay, boys. Leave it to me.

502
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,159
Ohh! Those pink elephants.

503
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,033
Ho! Pink elephants? Mm-mmm!

504
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,389
What's so funny? What are you boys
doin' down here, anyway?

505
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,556
What are we doin' down here?

506
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,477
Well, hear him talk.

507
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,433
Go on.
Fly up a tree where you belong.

508
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,669
- Say, look here, Brother Rat.
- Brother Rat?

509
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,917
Now listen. I ain't your brother
and I ain't no rat, see?

510
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,560
Uh-huh. And I suppose you...

511
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:34,309
and no elephant ain't
up in no tree, either.

512
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,790
No! No, me and no tree
ain't up no-- Huh?

513
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,876
Tree?

514
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,391
Yo!

515
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,955
Dumbo.

516
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,514
Dumbo. Wake up.

517
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,393
Wake up, Dumbo!

518
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,916
Don't look now,
but I think we're up in a tree.

519
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,474
Aw, don't pay no attention
to them scarecrows.

520
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,592
Come on, Dumbo.
Let's get back to the circus.

521
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,597
So long, boy!

522
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,470
But I wonder how we ever
got up in that tree, anyway.

523
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,909
Now, let's see.

524
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,434
Elephants can't climb trees,
can they?

525
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,949
Nah, nah, that's ridiculous.

526
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,958
Couldn't jump up.
Mm-mm. It's too high.

527
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,514
Hey there, son.
Maybe you all flew up.

528
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:03,309
Maybe we flew up.
Yeah, maybe we--

529
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,352
That's it! Dumbo! You flew!

530
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,914
Boy, am I stupid.
Why didn't I think of this before?

531
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,237
Your ears. Just look at 'em, Dumbo.
Why, they're perfect wings.

532
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:16,757
The very things that held ya down
are gonna carry ya up and up and up!

533
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,996
I can see it all now.

534
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,554
Dumbo, the Ninth Wonder
of the Universe!

535
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,796
The world's only flyin' elephant!

536
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,591
Did you ever see an elephant fly?

537
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,110
- Well, I've seen a horsefly.
- Ah, I've seen a dragonfly.

538
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,310
- Hee-hee. I've seen a housefly.
- Yeah!

539
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,991
See, I've seen all that too.

540
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,550
I've seen a peanut stand
and heard a rubber band.

541
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,438
I seen a needle
that winked its eye.

542
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:47,791
But I be done seen
about ever'thing

543
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,996
When I see a elephant fly

544
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:53,709
- What'd you say, boy?
- I said when I see a elephant fly

545
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,110
I seen a front porch swing
heard a diamond ring

546
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,879
I seen a polka-dot railroad tie

547
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,470
But I be done seen
'bout ever'thing

548
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,670
When I see a elephant fly

549
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,558
- Da da-da-da
- Da-da-da do-do-dow wow

550
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,393
- Da da-da-da
- Hey, wow

551
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,988
I saw a clotheshorse
He rear up and buck

552
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,231
And they tell me that a man
made a vegetable truck

553
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,118
I didn't see that
I only heard

554
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,754
Just to be sociable
I'll take your word

555
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,872
- I heard a fireside chat
- I saw a baseball bat

556
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,798
And I just laughed
till I thought I'd die

557
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,390
But I be done seen
'bout ever'thing

558
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,472
When I see a elephant fly

559
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,831
Bo Sho Ba-da-do-do

560
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,750
But I be done seen
'bout ever'thing

561
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,998
When I see a elephant fly

562
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:58,078
With the wind.

563
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:02,512
When I see a elephant

564
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,074
Fly

565
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,716
All right, you wise birds.
This has gone far enough.

566
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,678
Quiet, gentlemen.

567
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,274
The Reverend Rodent
is gonna address you.

568
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,437
You oughta be ashamed
of yourselves.

569
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,715
A bunch of big guys like you...

570
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,917
pickin' on a poor
little orphan like him.

571
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:37,079
Suppose you was torn away from
your mother when you was just a baby...

572
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,475
nobody to tuck you in at nights...

573
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:44,276
no warm, soft, caressin' trunk
to snuzzle into.

574
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,555
How would you like to be
left out alone...

575
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,877
in a cold, cruel, heartless world?

576
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,072
And why? I ask ya, why?

577
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:57,034
Just because he's got those big ears,
they call him a freak.

578
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,156
The laughing stock of the circus.

579
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,708
Then when his mother
tried to protect him...

580
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,075
they threw her into the clink.

581
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,789
And on top of that,
they made him a clown!

582
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,678
Socially, he's washed up.

583
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:14,753
Ah, but what's the use of talkin'
to you cold-hearted birds?

584
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,916
Go ahead. Have your fun.

585
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,952
Laugh at him.
Kick him, now that he's down.

586
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,349
Go on!

587
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,357
We don't care.

588
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,031
Come on, Dumbo.

589
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,436
Hey, brother,
w-w-wait a minute.

590
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,994
Uh, don't go away
feelin' like that.

591
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,236
We done seen the light.

592
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,151
You boys is okay.

593
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,356
Please, you've done enough.

594
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,558
Well, but we's all fixin' to help you.
Uh, ain't that the truth, boys?

595
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,796
- Well, it sure is.
- Uh, yeah, that-- You're right.

596
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,673
You wanna make the elephant fly,
don't ya?

597
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:02,036
Well, you gotta use a lot of 'chology.
You know, psychology.

598
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,072
Now, here's what you do.
First, you, uh--

599
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,997
Uh, bu--

600
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,873
And then, right after that,
you, uh--

601
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,959
Use the magic feather.
Catch on?

602
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,508
The magic feather?

603
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,477
Yeah, I gotcha.

604
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:22,996
Dumbo! Look! Have I got it!

605
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,873
The magic feather!
Now you can fly!

606
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,350
Let's go. Let's go.

607
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,750
- Heave ho. Heave ho.
- Let's go, Dumbo.

608
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:39,957
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Come on now.

609
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,871
- Up, down. Up, down.
- Heave ho.

610
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,076
- One, two, One, two. One, two.
- Heave ho.

611
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,355
Faster, faster.
Get up flyin' speed.

612
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,749
Retract your landing gear.
Raise your fuselage.

613
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,677
Take off.

614
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,591
Aw, it's no use, Dumbo.

615
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,035
I guess it's just
another one of their-- Look!

616
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,714
Hot diggity! You're flyin'.

617
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,677
You're flyin'!

618
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:12,556
Uh, why, he flies
just like a eagle.

619
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,835
That's better than a aeroplane.

620
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,269
Brother, now I've seen everything.

621
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,557
But I be done seen
about everything

622
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:26,878
When I see a elephant fly

623
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,911
With the wind.

624
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,874
When I see a elephant

625
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,474
Fly

626
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,028
Dumbo, I knew you could do it!

627
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,509
Wait'll we get to the big town.

628
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,950
Boy, them city folks is

629
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:58,079

Look at that house.
Dumbo,

00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:14,118
you're standing
on the threshold of success.

635
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,549
Don't look down.
It'll make you dizzy.

636
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:20,110
Boy, are they in for a surprise.
Ho-ho.

637
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:25,113

Okay. Contact!

639
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,397
Take off!

00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,835
Uh-oh. The magic feather!

641
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,357
Dumbo, come on. Fly.
Open them ears.

642
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:51,313
The magic feather was just a gag.
You can fly.

00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,318
Honest, you can.
Hurry! Open 'em up!

Now, loop the loop.

648
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,633
You're makin' history!

649

I've seen a peanut stand

650

- Happy landin', son.

When I see a elephant fly

660
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,276
I wish I'd have got his autograph.

661
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,038
Oh, man, I got his autograph.

662
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,355
Well, so long, glamour boy!
