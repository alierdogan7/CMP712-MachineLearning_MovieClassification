The subject With mom...

53
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:49,099

After a cup of tea.

63
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:23,140
There's no need to have the tea!

64
00:07:24,543 --> 00:07:28,138
My ideas are even dirtier!

65
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:41,158
You've met her so often.

66
00:07:42,761 --> 00:07:44,752

73
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:11,779
To fear that you might perhaps...

74
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:18,185
Object to the match? No...

75
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:22,790
Raj is an educated, Wise man.

76
00:08:23,802 --> 00:08:26,202
Decisions for himself.

77
00:08:28,206 --> 00:08:32,199
His decisions, too.

79
00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:40,810

- Good-bye, Mother.

83
00:09:10,248 --> 00:09:12,239
HoW do you find Shanti, mom?

84
00:09:13,518 --> 00:09:16,248
I like her a lot, too.

85
00:09:19,524 --> 00:09:22,857
You think of my decision?

86
00:09:24,262 --> 00:09:26,253
- Why must you?

87
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:27,854
What difference must it make...

88
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:32,860
...Whether I like it or not.

89
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:38,873
A difference to me.

90
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:39,875
Had for you...

91
00:09:42,881 --> 00:09:43,870

92
00:09:47,886 --> 00:09:52,880

93
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:54,685
But What does Shanti lack...

94
00:09:54,893 --> 00:09:57,293
Shanti lacks anything?

95
00:09:58,296 --> 00:10:00,287
I knoW she's a good girl.

96
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:04,892
Will have a blissful life.

97
00:10:05,303 --> 00:10:08,295
That joy for myself? - No!

98
00:10:09,574 --> 00:10:09,903
Because such insignificant joys...

99
00:10:11,576 --> 00:10:13,567
Who are inconsequential.

100
00:10:13,712 --> 00:10:17,910
Inconsequential person!

101
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:21,181
The bigger joys of life.

102
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,751
It makes no sense!

103
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:25,913
Shanti as your daughter-in-laW?

104
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:27,752
Why Wouldn't I like her?

105
00:10:27,926 --> 00:10:29,917
A good daughter-in-laW...

106
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,922
me for the rest of my life?

107
00:10:36,334 --> 00:10:38,325
To think of myself.

108
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:41,436
I am noW thinking of your future.

109
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:47,935
Your boss's daughter, Kamini.

110
00:10:50,348 --> 00:10:55,445
Even think of that, mom?!

111
00:10:55,954 --> 00:10:58,354
Who thought about this.

112
00:10:59,357 --> 00:11:01,348
He spoke to me at the party.

113
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,949
To marry his daughter.

114
00:11:04,362 --> 00:11:09,356
Partner in his company.

115
00:11:14,973 --> 00:11:20,377
You're saying, mom?

116
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:23,379
You'd better give it a thought.

117
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:26,974
A mere clerk in an office...

118
00:11:28,386 --> 00:11:32,982
only a burden of responsibilities.

119
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:37,987

120
00:11:38,663 --> 00:11:42,394

124
00:11:53,011 --> 00:11:54,672
But I have given her a promise!

125
00:11:54,746 --> 00:11:59,410
You Will achieve something in life!

126
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:06,423
Emotions and reject this opportunity!

127
00:12:08,026 --> 00:12:10,017
It is Kamini you must marry!

128
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:13,429
It is Kamini you have to marry!

129
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:48,060

You must be a busy man.

137
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:46,514
And I have done that.

138
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:53,120
There's something I must tell you.

139
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:57,131

Time as Madhav vacates it...

309
00:35:00,897 --> 00:35:03,798

353
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:44,109
But Who'd Want that land as security?

That he'd come here?

369
00:39:42,178 --> 00:39:44,669
Can't be trusted, boss.

And check it thoroughly.

382
00:44:18,621 --> 00:44:20,612
Dad said it's very important...

383
00:44:26,963 --> 00:44:28,954
This is Shekhar, Mr Gupta's son.

384

A cheque of Rs. 5 lakhs.

389
00:44:46,983 --> 00:44:47,972
- You must give it to my father...

390
00:44:49,986 --> 00:44:51,977
Why drag me into this?

391
00:44:53,389 --> 00:44:58,383
It's one and the same thing for me.

392
00:44:58,995 --> 00:44:59,984
- All right.

393
00:45:00,997 --> 00:45:04,398

01:03:12,716 --> 01:03:15,549
not to the hospital, okay?

564
01:03:16,453 --> 01:03:18,444
Of course, it's okay!

565
01:03:18,588 --> 01:03:22,547
The lanes Bhandari Walks on!

566
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:26,452
If you ask me to!

567
01:03:27,063 --> 01:03:29,054
Get going!

568
01:03:36,473 --> 01:03:38,464
Take 'em aWay!

569
01:03:44,748 --> 01:03:47,080
Started this company!

570
01:03:47,751 --> 01:03:51,482
With a contract I've Wanted!

571
01:03:52,489 --> 01:03:53,922
Walks into the business...

572
01:03:54,491 --> 01:03:56,482
...and snatches a contract

573
01:03:57,494 --> 01:03:59,485
It's okay, Daddy.

574
01:04:00,096 --> 01:04:02,087
We quoted a price in our tender.

575
01:04:02,499 --> 01:04:06,094
Lesser sum for the same facilities.

576
01:04:06,503 --> 01:04:07,936
Have got the contract.

577
01:04:08,505 --> 01:04:11,497
I've found every detail about that.

578
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:13,766
Of amount in our tenders?

579
01:04:14,778 --> 01:04:17,110
- One Rupee?

580
01:04:17,514 --> 01:04:19,505
Yes! One Rupee!

581
01:04:19,783 --> 01:04:22,115
Was the same as ours.

582
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,953
One measly Rupee!

583
01:04:25,522 --> 01:04:30,118
It's an extremely interesting one.

584
01:04:30,527 --> 01:04:33,121
As if Vijay Kumar knew...

585
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:36,121
...the details of our tender.

586
01:04:36,533 --> 01:04:37,966
But hoW is that possible?

587
01:04:38,535 --> 01:04:41,129
Who knew about it, it Was I...

588
01:04:42,138 --> 01:04:43,799
...and Miss Geeta.

589
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:45,801
I can't understand hoW...

590
01:04:46,142 --> 01:04:50,545
You may go noW.

591
01:05:01,825 --> 01:05:04,658
Of Rs. 3000, hadn't you?

592
01:05:05,562 --> 01:05:07,553
I Was in need of the money.

593
01:05:08,832 --> 01:05:12,563
Bhandari before you leave.

594
01:05:19,843 --> 01:05:24,576
Funeral pyre...

595
01:05:26,850 --> 01:05:29,842
for the one Who has tormented you.

596
01:05:31,588 --> 01:05:33,579
Of my battles today.

597
01:05:35,859 --> 01:05:37,850
But this is nothing...

598
01:05:39,596 --> 01:05:41,587
...the War is yet to begin.

599
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:46,191
Bless me!

600
01:05:53,943 --> 01:05:57,606
Games life plays With me.

601
01:05:59,883 --> 01:06:01,874
I have alWays Won the games...

602
01:06:03,887 --> 01:06:06,048
No matter What I had resort to...

603
01:06:06,890 --> 01:06:09,882
...or What price I had to pay.

604
01:06:12,629 --> 01:06:15,621
The habit of Winning.

605
01:06:18,635 --> 01:06:22,901
Defeat after all these years...

606
01:06:25,642 --> 01:06:27,633
Do you think I'll quit the game?

607
01:06:28,645 --> 01:06:33,639
Never do that!

608
01:06:38,655 --> 01:06:41,249
- Just a minute more.

609
01:06:47,263 --> 01:06:49,254
HoW are you?

610
01:06:50,667 --> 01:06:53,261
What happened the other day.

611
01:06:53,937 --> 01:06:55,928
But believe me...

612
01:06:56,673 --> 01:06:59,767

613
01:07:00,677 --> 01:07:02,110
- Yes.

614
01:07:02,278 --> 01:07:07,511
Striking a deal, I hope?

615
01:07:07,617 --> 01:07:08,276
Not at all!

616
01:07:09,686 --> 01:07:11,278
I remember What you told me.

617
01:07:11,688 --> 01:07:13,679
The World is up for sale.

618
01:07:13,957 --> 01:07:16,687
Put that incident behind us.

619
01:07:17,293 --> 01:07:19,693
Or it Would really hurt me.

620
01:07:22,699 --> 01:07:24,132
Comes from the heart...

621
01:07:24,701 --> 01:07:27,295
3

622
01:07:28,705 --> 01:07:30,696
I'm through With my shopping!

623
01:07:31,708 --> 01:07:33,801
She's R.K. Gupta's daughter.

624
01:07:40,717 --> 01:07:42,981
While I settle the bill.

625
01:07:53,997 --> 01:07:55,328
I'm not late, I hope?

626
01:07:56,332 --> 01:07:59,324
- She's settling the bill.

627
01:08:22,759 --> 01:08:24,750
You Will get your money, Bhandari...

628
01:08:25,361 --> 01:08:27,352

629
01:08:27,764 --> 01:08:30,756

...Will roll in Wealth!

634
01:08:42,779 --> 01:08:44,371

filed for the contract.

638
01:08:58,795 --> 01:08:59,386
A great risk, sir!

639
01:09:01,164 --> 01:09:05,794
I'll have lost my job!

640
01:09:07,804 --> 01:09:09,396

641
01:09:12,408 --> 01:09:14,399
...I'd take the risk!

642
01:09:21,417 --> 01:09:23,408
Thank you very much!

01:09:24,087 --> 01:09:26,078

645
01:09:39,102 --> 01:09:41,434
...the Maniklal Memorial contract.

646
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:45,831
Some changes in it.

647
01:09:46,843 --> 01:09:50,438
Bagged this contract, too?!

648
01:09:53,116 --> 01:09:55,107
Between our tenders?

649
01:10:11,467 --> 01:10:13,458
Maniklal Memorial hospital...

650
01:10:13,970 --> 01:10:15,961
...has gone to Vijay Kumar.

651
01:10:18,875 --> 01:10:22,470
Difference between our contracts...

652
01:10:24,147 --> 01:10:26,274
...Was once again just one rupee.

653
01:10:26,883 --> 01:10:30,876
- Right... one rupee.

654
01:10:32,155 --> 01:10:36,057
The difference of a rupee?

655
01:10:36,225 --> 01:10:38,489
- For the difference of...

656
01:10:39,495 --> 01:10:41,895
rupees did he pay you?

657
01:10:42,031 --> 01:10:44,022
Are you insinuating that...

658
01:10:46,169 --> 01:10:48,501
be a mere co-incidence!

659
01:10:48,905 --> 01:10:51,499
Everything about our tenders!

660
01:10:52,508 --> 01:10:54,499
Reveal the details to him?

661
01:10:54,844 --> 01:10:57,904
Who knoW about the tenders!

662
01:10:58,514 --> 01:11:00,914
KnoWs Vijay the best!

663
01:11:01,517 --> 01:11:04,509
Go ahead and deny that!

664
01:11:04,921 --> 01:11:06,912
I don't ever meet Vijay!

665
01:11:07,924 --> 01:11:09,516
Bump into him twice!

666
01:11:09,926 --> 01:11:13,191
Has occurred twice, too!

667
01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:19,524
Level such a false accusation at me!

668
01:11:19,936 --> 01:11:23,531
Ioyalty and sincerity!

01:11:24,207 --> 01:11:26,937
You used to!

670
01:11:40,556 --> 01:11:42,956
Before I leave, sir.

671
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,960
My voice against you.

672
01:11:48,231 --> 01:11:49,562
And sincerity for What it is Worth...

673
01:11:52,568 --> 01:11:56,561
offence at What he says.

674
01:11:57,974 --> 01:12:00,966
Such a man deserves only sympathy.

675
01:12:12,588 --> 01:12:14,579
By noW that one of his men...

676
01:12:18,594 --> 01:12:20,585
...is hand-in-glove With me.

677
01:12:21,264 --> 01:12:25,394
- I'm a smart guy, sir.

678
01:12:26,269 --> 01:12:29,261
But it Wasn't me!

679
01:12:29,605 --> 01:12:31,596
He unleashed a storm on poor Geeta!

680
01:12:33,009 --> 01:12:34,601
With you somewhere.

681
01:12:36,012 --> 01:12:39,004
She is in league With you!

682
01:12:39,282 --> 01:12:40,613
Crucial information to you!

683
01:12:41,284 --> 01:12:43,275
That's it! He promptly sacked her!

684
01:12:45,021 --> 01:12:47,012
- Come along!

685
01:12:51,294 --> 01:12:53,626
What misbehaviour is this?!

686
01:12:53,963 --> 01:12:55,624
Bring your tenders to me...

687
01:12:57,033 --> 01:13:00,025
...for a handful of money.

688
01:13:01,037 --> 01:13:03,028
Sacked an honest girl!

689
01:13:04,307 --> 01:13:06,298
This is the culprit!

690
01:13:07,643 --> 01:13:10,043
What is this I hear, Bhandari?

691
01:13:23,659 --> 01:13:26,127
In this office again!

692
01:13:26,228 --> 01:13:31,666
We ought to thank you, Mr Vijay.

693
01:13:32,668 --> 01:13:34,659
That's not necessary.

694
01:13:35,338 --> 01:13:36,669
Relationship With Miss Geeta...

695
01:13:37,673 --> 01:13:42,076
take the blame for my sake.

696
01:13:43,279 --> 01:13:45,270
To do all this?

697
01:13:46,082 --> 01:13:48,073
Bhandari Was helping you.

698
01:13:48,351 --> 01:13:51,343
Iosses, by exposing him?

699
01:13:53,089 --> 01:13:56,081
Are above gains and losses.

700
01:13:57,093 --> 01:13:59,357
Alas! Not everybody realises it.

701
01:14:16,379 --> 01:14:18,370
Discuss With you, Geeta.

702
01:14:20,116 --> 01:14:22,107
Which is Why I Wanted to meet you.

703
01:14:25,721 --> 01:14:27,382
What are you doing noWadays?

704
01:14:27,723 --> 01:14:30,715
Work at nothing, Work Wonders!

705
01:14:31,394 --> 01:14:33,385
Wonders noWadays!

706
01:14:40,136 --> 01:14:42,127
Will you Work With me?

707
01:14:45,408 --> 01:14:47,399
Why are you offering me a job?

708
01:14:48,144 --> 01:14:52,080
For me losing my job, right?

709
01:14:52,148 --> 01:14:54,742
No. That is not the reason.

710
01:14:57,153 --> 01:15:00,145
GroWing and expanding...

711
01:15:01,424 --> 01:15:05,155
I have a long Way to go.

712
01:15:06,762 --> 01:15:08,593
Shanti Constructions...

713
01:15:08,764 --> 01:15:09,753
corner of the city...

714
01:15:10,766 --> 01:15:12,757
other sign board of its kind.

715
01:15:17,173 --> 01:15:19,164
Etched in the skies.

716
01:15:22,778 --> 01:15:24,769
I can achieve all that, Geeta.

717
01:15:26,782 --> 01:15:31,185
Workers to help me achieve my goal.

718
01:15:34,190 --> 01:15:38,183
Ioyal and hardWorking than you are?

719
01:15:39,462 --> 01:15:41,453
Work With me then?

720
01:15:42,465 --> 01:15:47,801
More passionate about his Work.

721
01:15:47,937 --> 01:15:49,928
My question.

722
01:15:50,806 --> 01:15:52,797
Office open every morning?

723
01:15:53,476 --> 01:15:57,810
There is no closing time.

724
01:16:18,501 --> 01:16:20,492
The estimates are ready.

725
01:16:28,511 --> 01:16:30,843
And type them for me.

726
01:16:32,848 --> 01:16:34,839

He's doing it.

728
01:16:38,254 --> 01:16:40,245
Take a short break...

729
01:16:41,257 --> 01:16:42,690
Rest for a While.

730
01:16:43,259 --> 01:16:46,854
It should be sent tomorroW.

731
01:16:48,264 --> 01:16:49,856
Before the deadline.

732
01:16:50,266 --> 01:16:53,861
What's the hurry? We have time.

733
01:16:55,538 --> 01:16:59,872
No, Geeta. I have no time at all.

734
01:17:02,545 --> 01:17:04,536
I'm in a very great hurry.

They're still considered big.

01:18:28,631 --> 01:18:30,963
- He should be here soon.

744
01:18:37,373 --> 01:18:40,968

Why is he doing it?

822
01:30:01,050 --> 01:30:05,384

Of Mr R.K. Gupta in business.

833
01:31:03,847 --> 01:31:05,439
The rivalry to such extremes!

834
01:31:08,451 --> 01:31:09,440

01:31:10,453 --> 01:31:14,446
Iove and War, Geeta!

836
01:31:14,958 --> 01:31:16,289

Reflect What I look like!

847
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:58,891

You. Won't you offer me some tea?

849
01:32:02,906 --> 01:32:04,897

That's the preserve of celebrities.

855
01:32:36,205 --> 01:32:39,538
My friends are my celebrities.

856
01:32:39,943 --> 01:32:42,537

1123
02:27:31,494 --> 02:27:32,483
Because this is not business.

1124
02:27:33,496 --> 02:27:37,489
That is not business, Mr. Gupta.

1125
02:27:39,168 --> 02:27:40,499
Never understand the Woman...

1126
02:27:41,904 --> 02:27:43,496
and her affection...

1127
02:27:44,907 --> 02:27:47,171
Wasn't business.

1128
02:27:49,912 --> 02:27:51,903
Who are you talking about?

1129
02:27:52,515 --> 02:27:58,181
I'm talking about Shanti.

1130
02:28:00,089 --> 02:28:01,522
Of your life...

1131
02:28:03,192 --> 02:28:05,183
a counterfeit coin.

1132
02:28:06,329 --> 02:28:07,523
You used...

1133
02:28:08,531 --> 02:28:10,522
...as a ladder to your success!

1134
02:28:11,934 --> 02:28:13,526
I talk about...

1135
02:28:13,936 --> 02:28:15,528
to ask Why you did that to her...

1136
02:28:17,039 --> 02:28:19,030
have to Wrong her?!

1137
02:28:19,942 --> 02:28:22,934
About, Mr R.K. Gupta!

1138
02:28:25,214 --> 02:28:27,205
But hoW do you knoW of all this?

1139
02:28:29,218 --> 02:28:31,209
Mr R.K. Gupta.

1140
02:28:34,557 --> 02:28:38,550
The anguish in her heart...

1141
02:28:40,563 --> 02:28:43,225
the bad-name she got...

1142
02:28:44,233 --> 02:28:46,565
and the tatters she lived in...

1143
02:28:48,237 --> 02:28:51,968
And I remember it, too.

1144
02:28:54,243 --> 02:28:56,234
You had killed her soul.

1145
02:28:56,979 --> 02:28:59,243
Only 25 years later.

1146
02:29:00,249 --> 02:29:03,241
Still rages in my heart...

1147
02:29:03,586 --> 02:29:07,579
cursed Shanti's son...

1148
02:29:08,591 --> 02:29:10,991
illegitimate father!

1149
02:29:16,599 --> 02:29:18,590
Natural justice.

1150
02:29:20,002 --> 02:29:22,596
In consideration of Wealth...

1151
02:29:23,606 --> 02:29:25,597
has deserted you today!

1152
02:29:26,275 --> 02:29:29,608
Here's all your Wealth.

1153
02:29:30,279 --> 02:29:34,272
But poverty and shame.

1154
02:29:35,618 --> 02:29:37,609
Of my mother...

1155
02:29:39,288 --> 02:29:41,279
...return all your Wealth to you.

1156
02:29:48,297 --> 02:29:50,288
You have all your Wealth today.

1157
02:29:51,300 --> 02:29:54,030
Poorer man in my life!

1158
02:30:28,337 --> 02:30:29,668
- He's not in.

1159
02:30:31,073 --> 02:30:33,064
But there's a message for you.

1160
02:30:33,342 --> 02:30:34,331
By 10 tonight...

1161
02:30:35,344 --> 02:30:37,335
...your job Will be completed.

1162
02:30:48,691 --> 02:30:49,680
Who are you?

1163
02:30:50,693 --> 02:30:54,094
Let's go!

1164
02:30:54,763 --> 02:30:56,754
Have you sent someone, Mom?

1165
02:30:57,099 --> 02:31:00,091
I told him several times.

1166
02:31:00,703 --> 02:31:03,365
There's no sign of the groom.

1167
02:31:03,706 --> 02:31:06,368
No sense of responsibility!

1168
02:31:15,518 --> 02:31:17,713
In our custody.

1169
02:31:18,387 --> 02:31:19,718
Safe and sound...

1170
02:31:21,724 --> 02:31:27,526
take him aWay from Pragati Maidan.

1171
02:31:27,796 --> 02:31:30,731
To talk like this?

1172
02:31:30,900 --> 02:31:33,528
In killing Ravi!

1173
02:31:34,403 --> 02:31:35,734
So just go and tell Vijay Kumar...

1174
02:31:36,739 --> 02:31:37,728
to save your fiance...

1175
02:31:39,408 --> 02:31:41,399
...he must rush here immediately.

1176
02:31:41,744 --> 02:31:45,407
Of reporting this to the police!

1177
02:31:46,415 --> 02:31:47,746
Out of nervousness...

1178
02:31:48,417 --> 02:31:50,408
Without any reason.

1179
02:31:51,420 --> 02:31:56,414
Only for Vijay Kumar's ears.

1180
02:32:01,163 --> 02:32:03,154
Brother!

1181
02:32:12,775 --> 02:32:15,175
Take him there, Gangu.

1182
02:32:15,578 --> 02:32:19,173
You married to Ravi.

1183
02:32:20,783 --> 02:32:21,772
By calling me brother today...

1184
02:32:22,785 --> 02:32:24,776
...you have sanctified my oath.

1185
02:32:26,188 --> 02:32:29,453
Do any harm to Ravi!

1186
02:32:59,488 --> 02:33:01,479
This is perhaps my punishment.

1187
02:33:02,825 --> 02:33:04,816
I Want to apologise to you today...

1188
02:33:06,495 --> 02:33:10,488
to grant me pardon.

1189
02:33:10,833 --> 02:33:15,827
Like a blind man?

1190
02:33:18,240 --> 02:33:24,509
Sent your son... my son...

1191
02:33:26,515 --> 02:33:28,506
...into the jaWs of death!

1192
02:33:31,520 --> 02:33:33,511
But I give you my Word, Shanti...

1193
02:33:35,524 --> 02:33:39,858
That is a promise.

1194
02:33:43,265 --> 02:33:46,860
Forgive me...

1195
02:33:49,538 --> 02:33:51,529
...please forgive me.

1196
02:34:27,274 --> 02:34:28,866
I have arrived!

1197
02:34:29,276 --> 02:34:32,541
One smart move from you...

1198
02:34:34,281 --> 02:34:36,545
his brains apart!

1199
02:34:38,552 --> 02:34:41,885
And quietly come doWn.

1200
02:34:55,703 --> 02:34:57,694
That's more like it.

1201
02:34:59,573 --> 02:35:03,907
HoW's your business coming along?

1202
02:35:05,913 --> 02:35:09,314
Fulfill your condition.

1203
02:35:10,918 --> 02:35:14,581
- Sure, I'll let him go.

1204
02:35:17,324 --> 02:35:19,918
My scores With you.

1205
02:35:22,430 --> 02:35:24,421
No! You can't do that!

1206
02:35:25,332 --> 02:35:26,924
Your hand...

1207
02:35:28,602 --> 02:35:32,595
through Ravi's head! Get it?

1208
02:35:34,141 --> 02:35:37,599
You landed me the other day.

1209
02:35:41,348 --> 02:35:44,340
On the slap you gave me.

1210
02:35:45,619 --> 02:35:48,952
Iosing your temper today?

1211
02:35:49,123 --> 02:35:51,455
Silently, aren't you?

1212
02:35:53,627 --> 02:35:58,621
Let Ravi go.

1213
02:36:01,969 --> 02:36:06,963
Of course, I'll let him go.

1214
02:38:21,508 --> 02:38:24,500
Tie them up! I'll fix them!

1215
02:38:32,119 --> 02:38:35,520
You are late.

1216
02:38:36,790 --> 02:38:40,521
There he is.

1217
02:38:49,803 --> 02:38:53,136
Shekhar here, too, isn't it?

1218
02:38:54,141 --> 02:38:56,132
So Was I.

1219
02:38:56,543 --> 02:38:58,135
Cast on your son...

1220
02:38:59,146 --> 02:39:01,137
defend him so much.

1221
02:39:02,149 --> 02:39:05,812
Set your son free.

1222
02:39:08,555 --> 02:39:11,149
Let me have the briefcase.

1223
02:39:12,826 --> 02:39:14,817
It's 5 lakhs, isn't it?

1224
02:39:39,853 --> 02:39:40,842
What are you doing, Daddy?!

1225
02:39:41,855 --> 02:39:43,846
You ought to untie Vijay first!

1226
02:39:44,191 --> 02:39:46,182
You don't knoW...

1227
02:39:46,593 --> 02:39:48,584
I knoW everything!

1228
02:39:52,933 --> 02:39:54,924
Grab him!

1229
02:40:25,232 --> 02:40:29,225
For 5 lakh Rupees.

1230
02:40:30,637 --> 02:40:34,903
The right to kill him.

1231
02:40:36,243 --> 02:40:39,906
I denied you the pleasure?

1232
02:40:40,914 --> 02:40:43,246
Here you are... the revolver.

1233
02:40:44,651 --> 02:40:46,642
And there is Vijay.

1234
02:40:47,254 --> 02:40:51,418
Squeezing the trigger at your target.

1235
02:40:54,661 --> 02:41:00,065
Have such sympathy for Vijay?

1236
02:41:00,634 --> 02:41:03,262
Don't knoW the fact...

1237
02:41:05,272 --> 02:41:08,264
...that Vijay is my son.

1238
02:41:09,676 --> 02:41:11,667
Vijay is my son!

1239
02:41:13,280 --> 02:41:18,274
Back home With me.

1240
02:41:19,686 --> 02:41:22,280
By the police.

1241
02:41:24,291 --> 02:41:28,694
Are you in your senses?!

1242
02:41:29,696 --> 02:41:33,689
That I have come to my senses.

1243
02:41:34,101 --> 02:41:36,797
I'm proud of you, Daddy.

1244
02:41:37,971 --> 02:41:40,701
Set your brother free, Shekhar.

1245
02:41:46,313 --> 02:41:49,976
Urge to embrace Vijay as your son.

1246
02:41:51,318 --> 02:41:54,719
Without having my revenge.

1247
02:41:55,722 --> 02:42:00,318
Move from Where you stand.

1248
02:42:03,997 --> 02:42:06,727
My son...

1249
02:42:09,736 --> 02:42:11,328
- Daddy!

1250
02:42:23,016 --> 02:42:25,007
Beat them up!

1251
02:42:49,776 --> 02:42:51,767
What... have you done?!

1252
02:42:53,380 --> 02:42:54,369
To the hospital!

1253
02:42:55,382 --> 02:42:58,044
That much of time!

1254
02:42:58,385 --> 02:43:01,377
You've lost a lot of blood.

1255
02:43:02,055 --> 02:43:04,046
Let the blood floW, my son...

1256
02:43:04,391 --> 02:43:08,384
Wash aWay my sins.

1257
02:43:10,797 --> 02:43:15,393
I am responsible to you, my son.

1258
02:43:17,070 --> 02:43:18,401
But my sins must not cloud...

1259
02:43:20,073 --> 02:43:24,066
...your relationship With Shekhar.

1260
02:43:26,813 --> 02:43:31,216
Seek your forgiveness, my son.

1261
02:43:32,419 --> 02:43:34,410
But...

1262
02:43:36,823 --> 02:43:41,419
...do forgive me, if you can...
