00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:31,690
Until then, the stage is ours.

182
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,358
That stage made
for better storage.

183
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,062
Where were we?

184
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,366
I was about to make
a fool of myself.

185
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:45,838
My dear, do not limit yourself.

186
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:47,970
Nora Fay can take you

187
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,208
to the edge of your imagination
and beyond.

188
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:51,772
Is this you?

189
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:52,943
Was.

190
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,748
- You a singer?
- Was.

191
00:15:54,786 --> 00:15:56,253
Was this your husband?

192
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,085
Is.

193
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,057
Really?
In front of Morgan Hill?

194
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,559
Enough questions...

195
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,220
My kid just started there.

196
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:04,592
Did yours go there?

197
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:07,291
Oh, God, no!
I bore no children.

198
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:10,324
I thank the Lord above
for the grace he gave me

199
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:11,996
just to spawn Nora Fay.

200
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:13,163
Come, dear.

201
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:19,504
"And the youth, mistook by me,
Pleading for a lover's fee."

202
00:16:19,544 --> 00:16:21,603
I don't even know
what I'm saying.

203
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:23,637
That will come.

204
00:16:26,351 --> 00:16:28,512
"Shall we their
fond pageant see?

205
00:16:28,553 --> 00:16:30,578
Lord, what fools
these mortals be!"

206
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,613
Agreed, indeed!

207
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,516
Let's sing.

208
00:16:38,363 --> 00:16:39,694
Sing?

209
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:54,035
<i>[singing]</i>

210
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:13,421
Now you.

211
00:17:13,765 --> 00:17:15,733
- I don't know it.
- Follow me.

212
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:50,966
<i>[singing]</i>
<i>Lu, lu,</i> lu...

213
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:53,562

A deep breath.

00:17:54,806 --> 00:18:01,678

229
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,824
Looks like I'm one
of the lovers.

230
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:08,767
I'm not shaving.

231
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,365
At least you're not
the jackass.

232
00:20:10,408 --> 00:20:12,876
At least the jackass
doesn't have to wear a dress!

233
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,747
What is Thisby?

234
00:20:16,781 --> 00:20:18,578
Is that a chick?

235
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:27,222
Congratulations, gentlemen.

236
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:30,854
Awaken and empower
what's within!

237
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,898
Nice pipes.

238
00:20:37,802 --> 00:20:39,633
I heard your audition.

239
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,175
I saw the list.

240
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:53,946
Good afternoon.

241
00:20:53,985 --> 00:20:55,714
It's going to be superb.

242
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,346
So many fascinating...

243
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:01,792
I thought I told you my boys
don't got time for those parts.

244
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:04,556
Must I remind you that
Morgan Hill philosophy

245
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:08,464
clearly states that academics
transcends athletics?

246
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,663
Larry'll side with me
on this one.

247
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:18,842
I'll note you in my
book of memory.

248
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:22,637
Puck!

249
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,012
He's Puck in the play.

250
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,142
- What play?
- The senior play.

251
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:27,674
He's the main fairy.

252
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,414
- A fairy?
- It's a great part.

253
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,923
A fairy?!

254
00:21:32,957 --> 00:21:34,515
A kick-ass fairy.

255
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,493
You have lines to memorize.

256
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,857
We need a plan of attack.

257
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,057
This is great.

258
00:21:44,402 --> 00:21:46,097
Sick, aren't they?

259
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:50,469
Sick.

260
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:59,881
"I jest to Oberon
and make him smile

261
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:02,386
When I a fat and
bean-fed horse beguile,

262
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,615
Neighing in likeness
of a filly foal:

263
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,523
And sometime lurk I
in a gossip's bowl,

264
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,221
In very likeness
of a roasted crab,

265
00:22:10,261 --> 00:22:12,593
And when she drinks,
against her lips I bob"

266
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:22,930
This is for Helena.

267
00:22:24,442 --> 00:22:25,966
Where's the rest of it?

268
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,103
One of my personal favorites!

269
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:31,813
Patience, Dr. Bellinger.

270
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,250
I've not forgotten
about your frock.

271
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:38,314
These are for the
Pyramus and Thisby finale,

272
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:42,053
which I have reinvented
as an incredibly hip song.

273
00:22:42,093 --> 00:22:43,685
That's hot, Ms. T.

274
00:22:43,728 --> 00:22:46,094
Shakespeare was meant
for the masses.

275
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,764
<i>#</i>

276
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:52,869

You're early.

Oh... we could...

289
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:49,983
Couldn't wait one moment more
to show off my newest protege.

290
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:53,259
Nora Fay!
I'm honored.

291
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,822
Did you bring the new lotions?

292
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:57,767
Darling, we brought everything!

293
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,898
Go ahead!

294
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:07,073
She doesn't get it.

295
00:24:07,111 --> 00:24:10,239
This year's varsity rugby team
is one of the best

296
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:12,249
in the history
of our institution.

297
00:24:12,283 --> 00:24:18,051
So, this has nothing to
do with time requirements?

298
00:24:18,556 --> 00:24:20,956
We are concerned
about the tradition -

299
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,756
members of the rugby team
portraying females?

300
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:25,929
Truth be told!

301
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:29,024
It's bad for morale.
You're embarrassing them!

302
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,796
Only because you've
trained them

303
00:24:30,835 --> 00:24:33,861
to cast judgement
upon each other.

304
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:38,672
The Academy is concerned that we
are sending the wrong message.

305
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,304
The Academy has been
staging Shakespeare

306
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:43,814
in this fashion
for 56 years.

307
00:24:43,848 --> 00:24:45,475
We live in a different time.

308
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,883
Your ignorance of the history
of this Academy

309
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,649
and the history of the
theater is offensive.

310
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:55,925
Women were prohibited by law
to act on the Elizabethan stage!

311
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,723
Men filled the void.

312
00:24:57,762 --> 00:25:01,425
If this confabulation is about
your insecurities with sexuality

313
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:03,900
or the sexuality of
your warriors...

314
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:07,302
I don't have issues
with my sexuality!

315
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:09,829
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
is the senior play.

316
00:25:09,874 --> 00:25:11,842
The cast is chosen.

317
00:25:11,876 --> 00:25:14,037
Thank you, gentlemen.

318
00:25:24,622 --> 00:25:26,852
- Jock boy?
- I think he wants you.

319
00:25:26,891 --> 00:25:28,825
I think he wants
to kick my ass.

320
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,421
I think my star quality
is rubbing off.

321
00:25:32,463 --> 00:25:34,954
Why don't you rub up
on Max a little bit?

322
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,628
Maxie...
It's never gonna happen.

323
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,137
Well, stop waiting for him.

Mom?!

331
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:04,527
Hey, Ms. Tebbit needs
a band for the play.

332
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:05,961
Really?

333
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:07,191
Hey!

334
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,408
Where we going?

335
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:22,470
It's wet out here.
You'll catch cold.

336
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,747
You look beautiful.

337
00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:31,777
Right.

338
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:37,761
Training was good?

339
00:26:37,795 --> 00:26:40,355
Apparently, I've got a lot
of learning to do.

340
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:41,387
She said that?

341
00:26:41,432 --> 00:26:43,059
I know I could sell the shit

342
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,092
if she'd just let me
out the door with it.

343
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,071
I miss your daddy.

344
00:26:55,446 --> 00:26:57,846
- Dad's an asshole.
- We were better off.

345
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:01,880
What?

346
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,887
- You didn't even try.
- He kicked me out.

347
00:27:03,921 --> 00:27:05,479
You left!

348
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:08,549
You can have him.
I'm fine.

349
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:09,992
So, you'd rather live
with Frankie again?

350
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:11,120
She a better mother?

351
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:13,187
You're my mother!
Like it or not.

352
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:22,802
Why are you gay?

353
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,671
What did I do?

354
00:27:26,844 --> 00:27:29,244
You didn't make me queer.

355
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,440
Don't use that word, Timothy!

356
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:32,312
Nobody did.
I'm just queer.

357
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,114
- So deal with it.
- Go to hell!

358
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:38,316
I do deal with it, Timothy.
Every day I deal with it.

359
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:41,519
You're not the only one
who has it rough around here.

360
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:43,550
Every single day I come out
of the closet just like you.

361
00:27:43,594 --> 00:27:46,028
This is not just your problem.

362
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:49,056
It's both of ours
and I'm trying!

363
00:28:21,065 --> 00:28:24,000

364
00:28:35,379 --> 00:28:37,677
I'm open.
Over here!

365
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:44,248
Good form.

366
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:48,422
"What angel wakes me
from my flow'ry bed."

367
00:28:48,459 --> 00:28:49,858
<i>[bell rings]</i>

368

369
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:39,900
Good form?

370
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,468
He said that?

371
00:29:41,512 --> 00:29:43,377
Isn't he like super jock?

372
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:45,177
Come on, keep going.

373
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,583
Demetrius says,
"Yea, art thou there?"

374
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:59,523
"Follow my voice:
Will try no manhood here."

375
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,122
You'll need that manhood
for your jock boy!

376
00:30:01,165 --> 00:30:02,393
That's not what it means.

377
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:04,265
Manhood!

378
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,566
"Courage! They're about
to fight for love."

379
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,933
"My gentle Puck, come hither.

380
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,308
Thou rememberest
that very time I saw,

381
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:16,870
but thou couldst not,
Cupid all arm'd:

382
00:30:16,914 --> 00:30:20,975
a certain aim he took at
a fair vestal throned by..."

383
00:30:21,018 --> 00:30:24,681
"Vestal throned by the west.

384
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:29,825
And loosed his love-shaft
smartly from his bow,

385
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:32,329
As it should pierce
a hundred thousand hearts;"

386
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:33,694
Go on.

387
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:36,799
"Yet marked I where
the bolt of Cupid fell:

388
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:39,428
It fell upon a little
western flower,"

389
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:46,037
"Before milk-white,
now purple with love's wound."

390
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:47,942
Luscious. Continue.

391
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:51,142
"Fetch me that flower;
the herb I showed thee once:

392
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,150
The juice of it on
sleeping eye-lids laid

393
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,153
Will make or man
or woman madly dote

394
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,951
Upon the next
live creature that it sees."

395
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:03,154
"I'll put a girdle round about
the earth In forty minutes."

396
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:08,297
"Having once this juice -

397
00:31:08,332 --> 00:31:11,096
"I'll watch Titania
when she is asleep

398
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:14,866
And drop the liquor
of it in her eyes."

399
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:19,206
"The next thing then
she waking looks upon...

400
00:31:19,243 --> 00:31:23,145
She shall pursue it
with the soul of love."

401
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:28,681
We'd love to have you
stay for bible study.

402
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:30,380
- I have wings to make.
- It's a potluck!

403
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,651
No, for my son.
He's a fairy.

404
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,817
- A fairy?
- In a play.

405
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,918
Well, in real life, too.

406
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,929
He's gay.

407
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:42,364
My son is gay...

408
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:45,402
Or queer.

409
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,772
But the wings
are for the play.

410
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:54,468
A man shall not
lie with man...

411
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:56,673
Do you want the damn
eye cream or not?

412
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:06,717
Now, with the soul of love

413
00:32:06,757 --> 00:32:11,057
I ask of you the memorization
of act three tonight.

414
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:20,128
Timothy.

415
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,105
How is your text coming?

416
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:24,607
I'm trying, but I don't
understand half of it.

417
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:27,611
Unite rhythm with words

418
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:31,012
and they will unlock
to empower you -

419
00:32:31,048 --> 00:32:34,347
like A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S
DREAM come true.

420
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:38,822
"Take pains;
be perfect: adieu."

421
00:32:50,267 --> 00:32:52,827
Down... up... 9!

422
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,771
Down...
up... 10!

423
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:23,529
Who did it?

424
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:25,432
Look who just
flew in from Fairyland?

425
00:33:25,469 --> 00:33:26,458
Did you?

426
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,369
Hey, bud, calm down.

427
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:30,033
- Who did it?
- Let's walk.

Faggot!

429

Fight! Fight!

430
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,080
Look, guys!
I caught a fairy!

431
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:40,375
Leave the pansy alone.

432
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,850
Get out of here!

433
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:44,885
He's not worth it.

the earth In forty minutes."

435

I did something to you.

530
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:16,090
No! Just stay there.

531
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:17,889
And put your shirt back on.

532
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:22,855
Where is that damn page?

533
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:29,205
"I'll put a girdle round about
the earth In forty minutes."

534
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:32,174
"I'll put a girdle...

535
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:33,335
Shit!

536
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:35,402
"...In forty minutes."

537
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:52,260
Don't they get how lucky they
are to have you at their school?

538
00:43:52,295 --> 00:43:54,456
No, Max. They don't.

539
00:44:05,942 --> 00:44:08,103
That jock boy
is really missing out.

540
00:44:15,485 --> 00:44:17,112
Not for long.

541
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:20,813
Do you think
these are too... small?

542
00:44:20,857 --> 00:44:22,882
Mom!

543
00:44:25,128 --> 00:44:27,289
You need to go home, OK?

544
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:30,788
You need to go home
and think about Frankie.

545
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:37,867
Don't tell a soul about this.

546
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:39,637
About us?

547
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,541
My lips are sealed to quench
your sweet desire.

548
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:46,310
Max, goodbye.

549
00:44:46,349 --> 00:44:48,715
"Parting is such sweet sorrow!"

550
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:54,914
What now?

551
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:03,017
If you could make
someone love you, would you?

552
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:04,856
Shit. Obviously.

553
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:08,264
I was asleep.

554
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:11,467
Max helped me
with lines tonight.

555
00:46:11,501 --> 00:46:12,934
Yeah?

556
00:46:12,969 --> 00:46:14,869
He really likes you.

557
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:17,703
Is that in danger of
changing by tomorrow morning?

558
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:19,709
He wanted you to know.

559
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:21,506
OK.

560
00:46:23,246 --> 00:46:25,737
There was an accident.

561
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:27,511
What?

562
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,180
I'll fix it.

563
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,955

564
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:47,770
I couldn't sleep either.

565
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:05,051
Isn't that your
wedding dress?

566
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:07,579
Was.

567
00:47:21,037 --> 00:47:23,437
Don't run off and
scare me like that again.

Awww! Nasty!

Careful there, Coach.

00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:01,551
Timothy!

593
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,352
What did you do
to my boyfriend?

594
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:05,452
I missed your bright eyes.

595
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:07,520
- Come on!
- You promised!

596
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,122
Don't leave me.

00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:21,734
Gentlemen, this afternoon

598
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:26,272
we focus on balance
and coordination!

599
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:30,047
Essential skills to hone
for rugby won!

600
00:51:32,288 --> 00:51:34,051
Excellent!

601
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:36,650
Onward to the field, gentles!

602
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:50,230
Coach!

603
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:56,368
I'll see you later,
my prince!

604
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:01,312
You're mocking me, right?

605
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:02,978
You said he liked me.

606
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:08,619
How far I've chased you...

607
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:10,592
Sweet, why flee so fast?

608
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:11,651
You have practice!

609
00:52:11,694 --> 00:52:13,252
I can see
your heart beating.

610
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,127
I'm not done here yet, sport!

611
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:18,134
Is this the accident?
You seducing my boyfriend?

612
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:20,159
- Boyfriend?
- Yeah!

613
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:22,262
Max was the accident!
I'll fix it, I promise.

614
00:52:23,806 --> 00:52:25,171
Let's walk.

615
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:27,233
No!

616
00:52:28,444 --> 00:52:29,706
Timothy!

617
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:32,180
What is wrong with you?

618
00:52:36,452 --> 00:52:38,647
What is wrong
with all of you?!

619
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,225
This is really fucked up!

620
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:53,168
Donna, darling...
I have got to say,

621
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:55,398
I vacillated after
that first meeting,

622
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:57,702
but you surprise me daily.

623
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:59,435
First impressions
aren't my thing.

624
00:52:59,475 --> 00:53:00,874
They must be.

625
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:04,004
Lawrence says from the moment
he first laid eyes upon me,

626
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:06,709
it was true love.

627
00:53:06,749 --> 00:53:07,681
Was it?

628
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:10,277
There are no limitations.

629
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,847
I have none and you, too,
can rise above.

630
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:18,122
Remember, what you believe,
you will achieve.

631
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:21,857
Timothy... that's my son!

632
00:53:26,936 --> 00:53:28,733
<i>Timothy!</i>

633
00:53:32,308 --> 00:53:33,935
You know her?

634
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:35,638
That's my mom.

635
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:38,871
I'm Jonathon.

636
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:41,008
You have a brilliant son.

637
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:42,642
Oh, shit!

638
00:53:42,685 --> 00:53:43,674
Sorry.

639
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,449
We just had our nails done.

640
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:46,682
Nora Fay!

641
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,486
Mom, we've got to go.

642
00:53:48,524 --> 00:53:51,015
We've got a lot of...
practicing to do.

643
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:55,328
Timothy...
pleasure to finally meet.

644
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:59,495
And Jonathon Cordon!

645
00:53:59,535 --> 00:54:02,800
You look quite luminous.

646
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:04,170
I'm in love.

647
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:05,902
Yes.

648
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:09,641
This is exactly what I meant
by rising above, Donna.

649
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:11,112
Your son,

650
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:15,914
compatriots with
Morgan Hill's star rugby player!

651
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:18,113
We're not compatriots.
We're boyfriends!

652
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:21,681
I'm sorry.

653
00:54:22,825 --> 00:54:24,759
We have got to go!

654
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,631
<i>Johnny!</i>

655
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:37,465
Your son is a homosexual?

656
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:39,668
Ummm...

657
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:41,370
Yes, he is.

658
00:54:46,649 --> 00:54:48,344
Has your coach
lost his mind?

659
00:54:48,384 --> 00:54:50,045
I've outgrown you.

660
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:53,122
Is this a joke?

661
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:55,249
Don't mock my love.

662
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:59,125
Who would not change
a raven for a dove?

663
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:00,720
What?

664
00:55:00,763 --> 00:55:01,923
Fly away.

665
00:55:01,964 --> 00:55:03,454
<i>How could he not</i>
<i>desire a woman?</i>

666
00:55:03,499 --> 00:55:04,864
It's unnatural!

667
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:06,459
Let's go!

668
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:10,030
Wait here.

669
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:12,666
You better pick me
up at seven!

670
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:17,345
You can take your
ugly makeup

671
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:18,972
and shove it up
your unlimited ass!

672
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:27,018
May God bless you
and show you the light!

673
00:55:27,056 --> 00:55:28,546
I got your back, Mom.

674
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:30,183
Both of you!

675
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:34,326
Get out of my way!

676
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:35,956
Timothy! What the hell is that?

677
00:55:35,998 --> 00:55:38,523
Ohhhh! My mascara!

678
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:41,961
Let her walk in one
of my shoes a while.

679
00:55:42,004 --> 00:55:45,098
My eyes are tingling!

680
00:55:52,281 --> 00:55:54,306
Donna...

681
00:55:54,350 --> 00:56:00,653
Donna, Donna, Donna,
Donna, Donna...

682
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:07,321
Be not so bashful,
darling rare divine,

683
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:12,801
these luscious kissing
cherry lips are mine.

684
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:27,049
I'd like to welcome everyone

685
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:30,575
to the 56th Annual Morgan Hill
Spring Festival!

686
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,986
We are honored to have
several special guests

687
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:35,718
to help us ring in
this weekend's festivities.

688
00:56:35,758 --> 00:56:38,955
First and foremost,
the honorable Mayor Robbins!

689
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:45,261
We were also hoping
to have a representative

690
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:46,859
from one of our sponsors -

691
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:49,895
my beautiful wife,
Nora Bellinger -

692
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:52,874
but she is most likely
still out soliciting

693
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,503
some lucky townsperson.

694
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:02,818
Let's not go.

695
00:57:02,852 --> 00:57:04,649
Why?

696
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:07,383
You're different now.

697
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:10,591
What about
Cotton Candy Mountain?

698
00:57:10,626 --> 00:57:12,856
I'm don't think
you're ready for this.

699
00:57:12,895 --> 00:57:14,988
I cross my heart.

700
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:16,328
Seriously.

701
00:57:16,365 --> 00:57:18,356
I was beaten up
for being queer

702
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:20,130
before I even knew
what that was.

703
00:57:20,169 --> 00:57:22,228
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

704
00:57:22,271 --> 00:57:24,603
I don't need someone
to protect me.

705
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,938
You didn't even
like me yesterday, remember?

706
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:28,876
Sure, I did.

707
00:57:28,911 --> 00:57:31,675
But I fell in love
with you today.

708
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:33,648
- Come on.
- Stop.

709
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:40,020
- You are perfection.
- That's the pansy talking.

710
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:41,546
Come on!

711
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:44,050
It'll be fun.

00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:45,560
There's a kissing booth.

713
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:50,924
<i>And last, but not least,</i>
<i>our very own, Coach Driskill!</i>

714

I love this man!

715
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:05,238
If he's here with that fag,
I'll kill him!

716
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:07,215

prettier than him.

717

<i>I love this school.</i>

Our love for one another

719
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:19,319

the lights on this midway!

720
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:37,042
I hate this town.

721
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:39,047
I can't wait to graduate

722
00:58:39,081 --> 00:58:40,878
and get the hell out
of this place forever.

723
00:58:42,084 --> 00:58:43,642
It's not that bad.

724
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:46,018
Try looking at it

725
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:49,390
What about your family?

726
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:51,586
You mean my mom?

727
00:58:51,627 --> 00:58:52,924
Everyone.

728
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:55,931
It's just my mom...
on a good day.

729
00:59:00,369 --> 00:59:03,998
- I don't want to go back.
- To what?

730
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,302
Real life.

731
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:06,706
This is real.

732
00:59:07,977 --> 00:59:11,879
But so, so far from where
I woke up this morning.

733
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:19,752
People were staring at us.

734
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:21,518
Stare back.

735
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:27,524
People are just jealous...

736
00:59:27,563 --> 00:59:29,622
'cause I'm with
the best fellow in town.

737
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:51,579
People can change.

738
00:59:58,194 --> 01:00:00,856
If they experienced that,
they might.

739
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:06,528
<i>Look.</i>

740
01:00:08,971 --> 01:00:11,269
How many people
are in this town?

741
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:13,673
Ten-thousand, maybe.

742
01:00:16,812 --> 01:00:18,473
Let's go.

743
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:21,142
- Why?
- I've got people to change.

744
01:00:30,626 --> 01:00:31,752
Game's over, sport!

745
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:32,783
What?

746
01:00:32,828 --> 01:00:33,954
I missed you.

747
01:00:33,996 --> 01:00:35,827
Get the hell off of him!

748
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:40,065
Leave him alone!

749
01:00:40,102 --> 01:00:41,296
He's just messin'
with your head.

750
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:42,395
He's mine!

751
01:00:42,438 --> 01:00:44,030
Stop teasing him and go
back to your cheerleader!

752
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:46,598
Any love I had
for her is gone, I swear.

753
01:00:46,642 --> 01:00:48,974
Max, you love Frankie!
You know I know.

754
01:00:49,011 --> 01:00:50,535
Yes! Thank you.

755
01:00:52,214 --> 01:00:53,909
I love you.

756
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:56,411
When I vow, I weep.

757
01:00:56,452 --> 01:00:58,443
My tears do tell the truth.

758
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:02,249
I am going insane, officially!

759
01:01:04,226 --> 01:01:06,217
Found the fags!

760
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:10,161
You asshole!

761
01:01:11,967 --> 01:01:13,400
Stop it!

762
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:16,067
He's mine!

763
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:21,572
No! No!

764
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:24,776

let me in on this!

765

766

767
01:01:27,616 --> 01:01:29,846

I don't love you anymore.

891
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:56,897
I found him
this morning in bed

892
01:12:56,938 --> 01:12:58,906
with his best friend Russ.

893
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:00,965
They were holding
each other and kissing.

894
01:13:01,009 --> 01:13:04,001
Believe me, I taught them
both a lesson.

895
01:13:04,045 --> 01:13:06,070
"The course of true love
never did run smooth."

896
01:13:06,114 --> 01:13:07,581
What did you say?

897
01:13:07,616 --> 01:13:09,948
My son said the same thing!

898
01:13:10,118 --> 01:13:11,745
Ladies and gentlemen,

899
01:13:11,787 --> 01:13:15,416
what we have here is
a kind of coercive persuasion.

900
01:13:15,457 --> 01:13:18,153
- I'm in love!
- No, you're not!

901
01:13:18,427 --> 01:13:21,294
Has everyone gone insane?

902
01:13:21,329 --> 01:13:23,422
He's in love!

903
01:13:23,465 --> 01:13:24,762
Love!

904
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,098
The Bible states
that homosexuality

905
01:13:27,135 --> 01:13:29,865
is contagious -
in all sorts of ways.

906
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:31,702
It's that alternative
teacher and her Shakespeare!

907
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,571
Shakespeare was queer, too!

908
01:13:33,608 --> 01:13:35,508
- It's wicked!
- Do something!

909
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:41,314
Ladies and Gentlemen,

910
01:13:41,349 --> 01:13:43,044
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
is hereby cancelled.

911
01:13:43,084 --> 01:13:44,381
No!

912
01:13:44,419 --> 01:13:47,217
That is entirely
unfair to the boys!

913
01:13:47,255 --> 01:13:49,018
They've been
working so hard...

914
01:13:49,057 --> 01:13:52,254
And I am putting Ms. Tebbit
under a full investigation.

915
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:00,625
Firstly...

916
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:03,137
Mr. William Shakespeare
has never been proven

917
01:14:03,171 --> 01:14:05,901
to be a homosexual.

918
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:09,274
Bisexual, perhaps.

919
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:13,270
Regardless, if you will all
kindly return this evening

920
01:14:13,315 --> 01:14:18,617
for the play, I'm sure we
will all make amends.

921
01:14:18,653 --> 01:14:21,451
- My son's not coming!
- No!

922
01:14:22,924 --> 01:14:26,121
The play must go on!

923
01:14:26,161 --> 01:14:31,098
Your concerns will fade
like a nightmare,

924
01:14:31,132 --> 01:14:36,934
or with any luck,
a clandestine dream come true.

925
01:14:50,452 --> 01:14:52,147
I must locate your son.

926
01:14:52,187 --> 01:14:55,623
My words will appease
them only momentarily.

927
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:57,249
We looked everywhere.

928
01:14:57,292 --> 01:14:59,021
I have a notion.

Nora?

1088
01:27:20,067 --> 01:27:21,625
It's time to fly.

1089
01:27:39,987 --> 01:27:42,512
"If we shadows
have offended,

1090
01:27:42,556 --> 01:27:44,956
Think but this,
and all is mended,

1091
01:27:44,992 --> 01:27:47,358
That you have
but slumber'd here

1092
01:27:47,395 --> 01:27:50,455
While these visions
did appear

1093
01:27:50,498 --> 01:27:52,261
And this weak
and idle theme,

1094
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:54,860
No more yielding
but a dream,

1095
01:27:54,902 --> 01:27:58,565
Gentles, do not reprehend:
If you pardon, we will mend:

1096
01:27:59,807 --> 01:28:03,334
And, as I am
an honest Puck,

1097
01:28:03,377 --> 01:28:05,675
If we have unearned luck

1098
01:28:05,713 --> 01:28:06,975
Now to 'scape
the serpent's tongue,

1099
01:28:07,014 --> 01:28:09,005
We will make
amends ere long;

1100
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:12,542
Else the Puck a liar call;

1101
01:28:18,326 --> 01:28:22,285
So, good night unto you all.

1102
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:25,390
Give me your hands,
if we be friends,

1103
01:28:25,433 --> 01:28:28,459
And Robin shall
restore amends."

Donna, darling...

1106
01:29:22,223 --> 01:29:25,590
will you join me
for next week's seminar?

1107
01:29:25,626 --> 01:29:27,287
OK.

1108
01:29:28,996 --> 01:29:30,725
Yes, of course.

1109
01:29:31,665 --> 01:29:35,465
You're very lucky to have
such a marvelously talented son.

1110
01:29:38,506 --> 01:29:39,871
Goodnight.

1111

<i>You know, when I was</i>

1112
01:29:42,143 --> 01:29:44,077
<i>I made quite</i>

1113
01:29:44,111 --> 01:29:45,635
<i>I bet you did.</i>

1114
01:29:48,416 --> 01:29:50,179
Good evening, Coach.

1115
01:29:50,217 --> 01:29:52,947
What a talented bunch!

1116
01:29:52,987 --> 01:29:54,352
Indeed.

1117
01:29:54,922 --> 01:29:56,753
See you on Monday, Coach?

1118
01:29:58,626 --> 01:30:00,651
Evening, Nora.

1119
01:30:00,694 --> 01:30:02,389
Goodnight.

1120
01:30:19,246 --> 01:30:22,079
You were
unbelievable tonight.

1121
01:30:22,983 --> 01:30:25,850
Don't you feel...

1122
01:30:25,886 --> 01:30:27,854
I feel like myself.

1123
01:30:27,888 --> 01:30:31,517
"It's not enough to speak,
but to speak true."

1124
01:30:33,627 --> 01:30:36,562
Dude, awesome job!

1125
01:30:38,232 --> 01:30:40,723
You two love birds
better be at my party.

1126
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:42,759
It's gonna be beyond!

1127
01:31:10,664 --> 01:31:12,757
Who's next?
