At any rate, your last in Paris.

34
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,976
As the ambassador of Sylvania...

35
00:05:42,078 --> 00:05:44,312
I cannot any longer permit
our military attaché...

36
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:48,157
to disgrace the name of our illustrious
country with his shameless escapades.

37
00:05:48,263 --> 00:05:50,360
Your Excellency, please -

38
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:52,407
But that is an end.

39
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:57,320
You will leave at once for Sylvania and report
to Her Majesty the queen in person.

40
00:05:57,423 --> 00:06:02,233
But, Your Excellency, I'm sure the stories
you've heard about me are horribly-

41
00:06:02,337 --> 00:06:04,400
are horribly exaggerated.

42
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:08,922
Count Renard...

43
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:13,493
for one week, I made it my business
to follow you about personally.

44
00:06:13,605 --> 00:06:17,047
Oh. I'm sorry I didn't know it,
Your Excellency.

45
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:19,485
I would have taken you
to some real places.

46

47
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:26,604
I know more about you

48
00:06:33,464 --> 00:06:37,168
My wife has told me everything.

00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:46,964
You are to take the first train.

50
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,874
I think I had better take
the first airplane.

You are going by plane, monsieur?

52
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:07,529
Yes, Jacques.
And I've got to leave you.

53
00:07:07,631 --> 00:07:10,538
You're not going to take me with you?

54

- I'm sorry.
- But what will you do without me?

55
00:07:13,616 --> 00:07:16,181
Think how good I am
at making up excuses for you.

56
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,455
Why, I can even imitate your voice
on the telephone...

with another.

59

Yes, Jacques.
You're a very good servant.

60
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:28,853
And you can tell lies
better than anybody I know.

61
00:07:28,961 --> 00:07:30,865
But I won't need you anymore.

62
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:34,432
In fact, I will probably be sent
to a military prison.

63
00:07:34,545 --> 00:07:36,449
But even so, you'll need me, monsieur.

64
00:07:36,551 --> 00:07:39,047
Supposing someone you don't
want to see calls at the prison.

65
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,392
Who's going to tell them
you're not at home?

66
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:45,876
I can't see how anybody could be so anxious
to leave this beautiful Paris.

67
00:07:45,978 --> 00:07:49,010
But, monsieur, I am a Frenchman.
And to be a Frenchman in Paris is nothing...

68
00:07:49,121 --> 00:07:51,593
because everyone in Paris
is a Frenchman.

69
00:07:51,696 --> 00:07:53,633
- That's true.
- But to be a Frenchman in -

70
00:07:53,735 --> 00:07:55,969
- What is the name of your country?
- Sylvania.

71
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:59,711
That is different.
Why, even my stories will be new there.

72
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:04,094
I can actually tell them the one about
the Frenchman and the farmer's daughter.

73
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,434
Oh, please, monsieur,
take me to Pennsylvania.

- Sylvania.
- Take me to Sylvania.

00:08:08,812 --> 00:08:11,982
All right, Jacques. I'll take you there.
Go and pack the bags.

00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:19,008
# Oh, dream lover mine #

177
00:16:19,114 --> 00:16:22,758
# Secrets divine #

178
00:16:22,866 --> 00:16:29,995
# I will share them #

179
00:16:30,105 --> 00:16:35,761
# With you #

180
00:16:36,806 --> 00:16:41,993
# Dream lover
fold your arms around me #

181
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:47,653
# Dream lover
your romance has found me #

182
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:07,154
# Oh, my darling
I am just longing for a love of my own #

183
00:17:07,264 --> 00:17:10,908
- # Nobody indiscreet can find us #
- # Nobody indiscreet can find us, I know #

184
00:17:11,017 --> 00:17:14,056
# Dream lover #

185
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:19,125
- ##
- # Secrets divine #

186
00:17:19,226 --> 00:17:26,185
- ##
- # I will share them #

187
00:17:27,469 --> 00:17:31,513
# With you ##

188
00:18:01,749 --> 00:18:05,359
Please, Your Majesty.
Won't you tell us more about your dream?

189
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,020
I'm afraid I can't.

190
00:18:09,123 --> 00:18:12,854
It wasn't just exactly
the sort of dream for a queen.

191
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,428
Was it the sort of dream
for a lady-in-waiting?

192
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:18,157
I hope not.

193
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:21,860
I had a lovely dream myself-
about Your Majesty.

194
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:25,666
I dreamed that Your Majesty
got married.

195
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:27,741
And you call that a lovely dream?

196
00:18:27,842 --> 00:18:32,506
Why not, Your Majesty?
We all wish, we all hope, we all pray...

197
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:35,480
- that very soon Your Majesty will be -
- Married.

198
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:38,518
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Marriage. Marriage.

199
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:41,747
In all my country,
nothing else is ever spoken of.

200
00:18:41,856 --> 00:18:43,756
What do the children learn at school?

201
00:18:43,858 --> 00:18:46,190
"The queen is unmarried still."

202
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:49,319
What do the papers write about?
"Is the queen to marry?"

203
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,763
What does my Parliament debate?
"When shall the queen marry?"

204
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:55,427
And from my ministers:
"Whom shall the queen marry?"

205
00:18:55,536 --> 00:18:59,028
Marriage. Marriage.
That's all I hear, morning or night.

206
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:03,875
## ("Wedding March")

207
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,411
Didn't I tell that conductor
never to play the "Wedding March" again?

208
00:19:09,517 --> 00:19:12,384
But, Your Majesty,
it is not the same conductor.

209
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:15,080
- This is a new one.
- Where's the old one?

210
00:19:15,189 --> 00:19:17,817
He is being married today.

211
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:20,325
Oh.

212
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:22,395
Oh.

213
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,931
Phew!

214
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:28,399
<i>(Continues)</i>

215
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:33,973
<i>- (Ends)
- (Trumpet Fanfare)</i>

216
00:19:43,117 --> 00:19:46,109
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Your Majesty.

217
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:50,186
Well?

218
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,589
Whom can you suggest today?

219
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:55,025
For what, Your Majesty?

220
00:19:55,129 --> 00:19:58,098
For my husband.

221
00:19:58,199 --> 00:20:00,394
Now don't tell me
you weren't talking about it.

222
00:20:01,435 --> 00:20:03,926
You're always talking about it.

223
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:07,337
We have no one to suggest,
Your Majesty.

224
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:09,341
We have given the matter up.

225
00:20:09,443 --> 00:20:12,344
<i>- Really?
- (Ministers) Yes, Your Majesty.</i>

226
00:20:12,446 --> 00:20:14,710
Oh, what a relief.
(Chuckles)

227
00:20:14,815 --> 00:20:16,749
Oh, how glad I am.
(Chuckles)

228
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:20,453
And, uh...

229
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:23,853
why have you given the matter up,
may I ask?

230
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,892
- Well, uh -
- (All Clearing Throats)

231
00:20:25,993 --> 00:20:29,724
<i>- You see, it's rather difficult.
- (Ministers) Very difficult.</i>

232
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,798
Difficult?

233
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:34,265
You tell me it's difficult
to find a husband for me?

234
00:20:34,368 --> 00:20:36,802
<i>(Ministers)
Yes, Your Majesty.</i>

235
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:41,797
Excuse me, Baron.
How does Her Majesty feel today?

236
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:47,506
(Louise) And that's final, Admiral.
I certainly don't need any help from the navy.

237
00:20:47,615 --> 00:20:49,549
Yes, Your Majesty.

238
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:58,852
But surely Your Majesty must realize
that the field for selection is limited.

239
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:01,393
If marrying you
were to make a man a king...

240
00:21:01,495 --> 00:21:03,395
that would be different.

241
00:21:03,497 --> 00:21:08,525
But Your Majesty's husband
would be simply prince consort.

242
00:21:08,636 --> 00:21:11,127
After all, what is a prince consort?

243
00:21:11,238 --> 00:21:15,174
He is a gentleman with a thousand duties
and no rights.

244
00:21:15,276 --> 00:21:19,542
- He has nothing to say, nothing to do.
- Well, I wouldn't say that.

245
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:25,210
(Whispering)

246
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:34,291
<i>Of course,
he has something to do, naturally.</i>

247
00:21:34,395 --> 00:21:39,094
And yet, uh, he has nothing to do,
if you see what I mean.

248
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:41,167
I see.

249
00:21:41,268 --> 00:21:44,294
<i>He is Your Majesty's husband
and nothing else.</i>

250
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:47,439
Nothing else?

251
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:50,942
<i>- But isn't it enough to be my husband?
- But, Your Majesty-</i>

252
00:21:51,045 --> 00:21:54,811
It never seems to occur to you gentlemen
that there might possibly be some men...

253
00:21:54,915 --> 00:21:58,407
who would enjoy being my husband
even if I were not a queen.

254
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:01,454
My face isn't actually painful to look at.

255
00:22:01,555 --> 00:22:03,955
My complexion's quite good.

256
00:22:04,058 --> 00:22:07,323
And in case you're too serious-minded
to notice such things...

257
00:22:07,428 --> 00:22:09,362
let me inform you...

258
00:22:09,463 --> 00:22:11,590
my legs are perfect.

259
00:22:17,571 --> 00:22:20,938
There's only one other leg like that
in the whole of Sylvania.

260
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:25,277
And that's it.
Do you see?

261
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:27,939
Thank you.

262
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:30,039
I didn't see, Your Majesty.

263
00:22:35,823 --> 00:22:37,882
(Whispering)
How do you think I should behave?

264
00:22:37,992 --> 00:22:42,258
Should I be humble, proud, apologetic?

265
00:22:42,363 --> 00:22:44,422
Say as little as possible.

266
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:48,831
I don't think your French accent
will please Her Majesty.

267
00:22:50,337 --> 00:22:52,362
(Strong French Accent)
Is it still very notice-able?

268
00:22:52,473 --> 00:22:55,033
No. It's very noticeable.

269
00:22:56,143 --> 00:22:58,111
<i>(French Pronunciation)
Oh. But that's terrible.</i>

270
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:00,772
No. It's terrible.

271
00:23:02,082 --> 00:23:05,381
How did you acquire this accent?

272
00:23:05,486 --> 00:23:08,387
(Chuckles)
I'll tell you.

273
00:23:08,489 --> 00:23:11,947
Once, in Paris,
I had an awful cold.

274
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,496
I went to see a great French doctor
to cure it.

275
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:22,497
I rang the bell.
The door was opened by a lady.

276
00:23:22,603 --> 00:23:26,630
- Mm-hmm.
- A beautiful lady.

277
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,708
Mm-hmm.

278
00:23:30,411 --> 00:23:32,379
The doctor's wife.

279
00:23:34,782 --> 00:23:36,750
(No Audible Dialogue)

280
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:51,230
And in less than a month...

281
00:23:51,331 --> 00:23:53,492
I had lost my cold...

282
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,194
but I had a terrific French accent.

283
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:03,968
<i>(Louise) And if I'm talked to like this again,
I'll dissolve the cabinet.</i>

284
00:24:04,078 --> 00:24:06,876
<i>- (Minister) Yes, Your Majesty.
- I'll dismiss the whole general staff.</i>

285
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,948
<i>- (Minister #2) Yes, Your Majesty.
- And if that band...</i>

286
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:11,916
<i>plays the "Wedding March"once more...</i>

287
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:15,352
<i>- I'll give orders to shoot!
- (Ministers) Yes, Your Majesty.</i>

288
00:24:18,192 --> 00:24:20,752
I'm sorry, Count.

289
00:24:20,861 --> 00:24:22,829
You're next.

290
00:24:47,054 --> 00:24:49,682
- What do you want?
- Count Alfred Renard...

291
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:53,157
Your Majesty's military attaché
at Your Majesty's embassy in Paris.

292
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,956
Ordered home for an audience
with Your Majesty.

293
00:24:57,264 --> 00:24:59,232
- You'll have to wait.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

294
00:25:23,123 --> 00:25:25,523
- What do you want?
- Count Alfred Renard...

295
00:25:25,626 --> 00:25:27,924
Your Majesty's military attaché
at Your Majesty's embassy in Paris.

296
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:29,928
Ordered home for an audience
with Your Majesty.

297
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,498
- Didn't I tell you to wait?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

298
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,931
<i>- Then wait.
- Yes, Your Majesty.</i>

299
00:27:04,591 --> 00:27:06,559
Count.

300
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:12,955
Count Alfred, I understand
you've been seriously involved...

301
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:15,796
in a disgraceful affair with a woman.

302
00:27:16,837 --> 00:27:18,737
No, Your Majesty.

303
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:20,807
With several.

304
00:27:22,876 --> 00:27:25,743
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

305
00:27:28,949 --> 00:27:30,883
Yes, Your Majesty.

306
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:34,677
(Both Chuckling)

307
00:27:40,761 --> 00:27:42,661
I don't think it's funny.

308
00:27:42,763 --> 00:27:45,732
I think it's serious.
Very serious.

309
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:48,596
- And I shall have to punish you.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

310
00:27:48,702 --> 00:27:52,229
- I shall have to punish you very severely.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

311
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:54,273
Otherwise you'd start all over again.

312
00:27:54,374 --> 00:27:56,342
(Chuckles)
Yes!

313
00:27:57,377 --> 00:28:00,540
I shall think of a punishment
that will cure you forever.

314
00:28:00,647 --> 00:28:02,808
An awful punishment.

315
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:06,750
Let me see.
An awful punishment.

316
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:18,222
You shall be ordered...

317
00:28:18,332 --> 00:28:20,300
to grow a beard.

318
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,806
- A beard, Your Majesty?
- Yes.

319
00:28:26,907 --> 00:28:29,671
That will stop all your philandering.

320
00:28:29,776 --> 00:28:32,472
You'll have to be serious in a beard.

321
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:36,606
And am I to be permitted to attend
Your Majesty after the beard is grown?

322
00:28:36,717 --> 00:28:41,484
Certainly. I shall want to see
that my instructions have been obeyed.

323
00:28:41,588 --> 00:28:45,149
Then I fear Your Majesty
will regret the order.

324
00:28:45,258 --> 00:28:47,852
I look terrible in a beard.

325
00:28:47,961 --> 00:28:50,122
- Really?
- Oh, dreadful.

326
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:54,929
(Chuckles) Of course, there are men
who look fine in beards, like sheiks.

327
00:28:55,035 --> 00:28:57,333
- Well, yes. That's what I thought.
- But I don't.

328
00:28:57,437 --> 00:28:59,428
- No?
- Oh!

329
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:01,905
Oh, I grew one once to see.

330
00:29:02,008 --> 00:29:05,341
Ah, it came out all red and scraggly.

331
00:29:05,445 --> 00:29:07,970
Oh, no. No, I assure Your Majesty...

332
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:11,278
it would be the most
awful-looking beard in Sylvania.

333
00:29:11,385 --> 00:29:14,582
And - (Chuckles)
That's saying a great deal.

334
00:29:14,688 --> 00:29:16,622
- Well, then don't grow it.
- No, Your Majesty.

335
00:29:16,723 --> 00:29:18,623
- Don't do it.
- No, no, Your Majesty.

336
00:29:18,725 --> 00:29:20,625
- No beard.
- No, no, Your Majesty.

337
00:29:20,727 --> 00:29:23,389
- You promise me.
- My word of honor.

338
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:30,294
But what can I do with you?

339
00:29:30,404 --> 00:29:32,599
I've got to punish you.

340
00:29:32,706 --> 00:29:35,573
<i>May I make a suggestion?</i>

341
00:29:35,675 --> 00:29:38,269
You want to suggest
a punishment for yourself?

342
00:29:38,378 --> 00:29:40,369
<i>Yes.</i>

343
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,448
Of course.

344
00:29:44,584 --> 00:29:46,552
Please.

345
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:53,426
Well, tell me.

346
00:29:54,494 --> 00:29:56,894
If I were in Your Majesty's place...

347
00:29:56,997 --> 00:29:58,931
I would say this:

348
00:29:59,032 --> 00:30:01,557
"Count Alfred...

349
00:30:01,668 --> 00:30:04,762
"the sort of life you've been leading
must stop.

350
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:07,339
You shall not return to Paris."

351
00:30:07,441 --> 00:30:09,932
Very good.

352
00:30:10,043 --> 00:30:12,807
Then I would say:

353
00:30:12,913 --> 00:30:14,904
- "Alfred" -
- Hmm?

354
00:30:15,015 --> 00:30:18,712
"Count Alfred, you shall stay here...

355
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:20,719
"in the palace...

356
00:30:20,821 --> 00:30:23,187
"attached to me.

357
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:28,057
And from morning till night,
never dare to leave my side."

358
00:30:29,763 --> 00:30:31,822
And you call that a punishment?

359
00:30:31,932 --> 00:30:35,299
- (Chuckles)
- You're the most impudent man I've ever met.

360
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:40,506
You seem to forget
you're talking to your queen.

361
00:30:42,075 --> 00:30:44,339
(Rings)

362
00:30:50,851 --> 00:30:53,217
Count Alfred will dine with me tonight.

363
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:04,829
At 8:00?

364
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:06,899
Yes, Your Majesty.

365
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:13,266
- White uniform.
- (Chuckles)

366
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:15,341
Yes, Your Majesty.

367
00:31:17,677 --> 00:31:19,872
<i>You understand?</i>

368
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,175
Oh, yes, I understand.

369
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:32,458
# With such a bad report of you
I wonder what I ought to do with you #

370
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,256
# You really can't be too severe
when my regret is so sincere #

371
00:31:36,363 --> 00:31:38,888
# And true #

372
00:31:38,999 --> 00:31:41,695
# If you were on probation #

373
00:31:41,801 --> 00:31:43,735
# Could I depend on you #

374
00:31:44,804 --> 00:31:47,568
# To make you think more kindly #

375
00:31:47,674 --> 00:31:51,007
# Let me obey you blindly #

376
00:31:51,111 --> 00:31:55,070
# You mean you'd really do #

377
00:31:55,181 --> 00:31:58,014
# Anything to please the queen #

378
00:31:58,118 --> 00:32:01,053
# Everything to please the queen #

379
00:32:01,154 --> 00:32:03,088
# Morning, noon and night #

380
00:32:03,189 --> 00:32:06,989
# I'm yours to command me #

381
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:09,891
# You want me good
Then I'll be good #

382
00:32:09,996 --> 00:32:12,863
# You want me bad
Then I'll be bad #

383
00:32:12,966 --> 00:32:15,196
# I mean, I could be both #

384
00:32:15,302 --> 00:32:17,270
# If you demand me #

385
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:19,270
# Understand me #

386
00:32:19,372 --> 00:32:22,102
# What if I demand your head #

387
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:25,041
# Perhaps you'd like my arms instead #

388
00:32:25,145 --> 00:32:29,514
# I've lost my head
the moment I saw you smile #

389
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:31,516
# Remember you're on trial #

390
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:34,018
# Will you do as I advise #

391
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:38,181
- # Madame, you will be surprised #
- # You mean #

392
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:40,452
# Anything to please the queen #

393
00:32:42,862 --> 00:32:45,558
# Anything to please the queen #

394
00:32:45,665 --> 00:32:48,463
# Everything to please the queen #

395
00:32:48,568 --> 00:32:50,468
# Morning, noon and night #

396
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:53,971
# I'm yours to command me #

397
00:32:54,074 --> 00:32:57,066
# You want me cold
Then I'll be cold #

398
00:32:57,177 --> 00:32:59,873
# You want me bold
Then I'll be bold #

399
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,346
# I'll be bold or cold or hot #

400
00:33:02,449 --> 00:33:04,349
# As you demand me #

401
00:33:04,451 --> 00:33:06,351
# Understand me #

402
00:33:06,453 --> 00:33:08,978
# You'll keep watch all day for me #

403
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:11,853
# A good night watchman I will be #
(Chuckles)

404
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:16,088
# I've learned that duty in Paris
You leave it to me #

405
00:33:16,196 --> 00:33:20,656
# You'd better wait and see
We shall find how good you are #

406
00:33:20,767 --> 00:33:23,395
# I've had no complaints so far #

407
00:33:23,503 --> 00:33:27,132
- # You mean #
- # Anything to please the queen #

408
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:37,646
# Anything to please the queen ##

409
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,352
Perhaps you didn't quite
follow me, Count.

410
00:33:42,455 --> 00:33:45,481
You're invited for dinner, not for tea.

411
00:33:45,592 --> 00:33:49,119
I followed Your Majesty perfectly.

412
00:33:49,229 --> 00:33:52,357
Hmm. Too perfectly, I'm afraid.

413
00:33:52,465 --> 00:33:54,956
Remember. 8:00.

414
00:33:55,068 --> 00:33:57,036
8:00.

415
00:34:00,774 --> 00:34:02,742
<i>Oh, Count.</i>

416
00:34:04,144 --> 00:34:07,375
Don't forget. No beard.

417
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,846
Oh, no, Your Majesty.

418
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,053
# Anything to please the queen
Everything to please the queen #

419
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:22,720
# Morning, noon and night
I'm yours to command ##

420
00:34:29,502 --> 00:34:31,970
<i>(Bell Tolling)</i>

421
00:34:33,873 --> 00:34:37,104
<i>(Tolling Continues)</i>

422
00:34:48,121 --> 00:34:50,885
<i>(Jacques)
Just a minute, monsieur.</i>

423
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:55,359
In case some lady should telephone,
am I to say you have a date with the queen?

424
00:34:55,462 --> 00:34:57,362
- No lady will telephone.
- But if?

425
00:34:57,464 --> 00:35:00,900
Impossible. There is no telephone.

426
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,968
(Laughs)

427
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:28,852
Do you know the story
of the Frenchman and the farmer's daughter?

428
00:35:30,497 --> 00:35:32,465
I know it.

429
00:35:34,501 --> 00:35:36,915
I am the Frenchman.

430
00:35:37,018 --> 00:35:39,055
You are not.

431
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:41,410
How do you know?

432
00:35:41,516 --> 00:35:44,092
I am the farmer's daughter.

433
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,820
Go home.

434
00:35:57,932 --> 00:35:59,877
Are you talking to me
or to the dog?

435
00:35:59,979 --> 00:36:02,050
- Is this your animal?
- Yes.

436
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:06,819
Then take it away. Don't you see it is eating
out of the same dish as the queen's dog?

437
00:36:07,935 --> 00:36:10,945
Listen here. If my master's good enough
to have dinner with the queen...

438
00:36:11,056 --> 00:36:13,539
then his dog can eat dinner
with the queen's dog.

439
00:36:14,681 --> 00:36:18,366
- So, that's your master.
- Yes.

440
00:36:18,475 --> 00:36:22,630
- That naughty boy from Paris?
- Yes.

441
00:36:22,737 --> 00:36:25,724
Do you know why the queen
has invited him for dinner?

442
00:36:25,826 --> 00:36:27,737
Because the king's away.

443
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,751
There is no king.

444
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,269
- She hasn't got a husband?
- No.

445
00:36:32,372 --> 00:36:36,332
Oh. Now I know why she invited him.

446
00:36:36,433 --> 00:36:39,546
(Whispered Chattering)

447
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:45,184
But, gentlemen, even if she liked him, would
he be eligible to become the prince consort?

448
00:36:45,296 --> 00:36:50,262
Why, absolutely. His great grandfather
was the illegitimate son of one king...

449
00:36:50,364 --> 00:36:53,042
and his grandmother
the sweetheart of another.

450
00:36:53,151 --> 00:36:55,062
- Oh.
- (All Murmuring)

451
00:36:55,165 --> 00:36:58,243
I had no idea that he came from
such a distinguished family.

452
00:36:58,354 --> 00:37:00,460
And do you think Her Majesty is serious?

453
00:37:00,569 --> 00:37:02,481
Why, how can you doubt it?

454
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:05,536
The first time she sees him,
she invites him to dine with her alone.

455
00:37:05,638 --> 00:37:09,025
- And if it goes on at this rate -
- Then we're entitled to the highest hopes.

456
00:37:09,129 --> 00:37:12,642
- (Chattering)
- Shh! They're coming.

457
00:37:17,017 --> 00:37:18,997
They sit down.

458
00:37:19,098 --> 00:37:21,376
They are seated.

459
00:37:22,925 --> 00:37:24,905
She smiles at him.

460
00:37:25,007 --> 00:37:27,250
He smiles at her.

461
00:37:27,356 --> 00:37:29,267
They both smile...

462
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:31,578
at each other!

463
00:37:31,687 --> 00:37:34,193
At each other?
(Murmuring)

464
00:37:34,305 --> 00:37:38,093
- She is laughing.
- That's the way they always start.

465
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:40,739
And how she laughs.

466
00:37:40,851 --> 00:37:44,033
He must have told her the story
of the Frenchman and the farmer-

467
00:37:45,987 --> 00:37:48,333
The lackey is bringing in champagne.

468
00:37:48,437 --> 00:37:52,627
- Now they are clinking glasses.
- (Murmuring)

469
00:37:52,734 --> 00:37:55,881
- She drinks his health.
- (Murmuring)

470
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,970
He drinks hers.

471
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:03,331
He tells her, " This is the most beautiful
moment of my life."

472
00:38:03,441 --> 00:38:06,154
How do you know that he does?
You can't hear anything.

473
00:38:06,261 --> 00:38:09,111
- What else could he say?
- (Chattering)

474
00:38:09,352 --> 00:38:11,892
They've opened the window.

475
00:38:12,004 --> 00:38:13,915
What does it mean?

476
00:38:14,018 --> 00:38:17,978
- The queen is warm.
- The champagne.

477
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,253
No. It's him.

478
00:38:21,537 --> 00:38:25,016
She's going to her boudoir.
She opens the door.

479
00:38:25,128 --> 00:38:27,040
(Whispering)

480
00:38:27,143 --> 00:38:30,095
- She enters the boudoir.
- Heavens!

481
00:38:30,197 --> 00:38:32,440
She beckons to him.

482
00:38:32,547 --> 00:38:34,790
He enters.

483
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:37,712
(Chattering Excitedly)

484
00:38:38,825 --> 00:38:41,605
She closes the door behind them!

485
00:38:41,711 --> 00:38:44,057
Heaven save the queen!

486
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:10,041
You know, Count...

487
00:39:10,143 --> 00:39:15,614
this is the first time
I've ever dined with a man alone.

488
00:39:15,716 --> 00:39:18,703
And this is the first time
I have ever-

489
00:39:18,803 --> 00:39:20,943
<i>Don't lie.</i>

490
00:39:21,053 --> 00:39:25,104
The first time I ever dined
with a queen.

491
00:39:26,256 --> 00:39:28,328
<i>But with women?</i>

492
00:39:28,438 --> 00:39:30,921
(Chuckles)

493
00:39:31,023 --> 00:39:33,094
Of course.
(Chuckles)

494
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:35,185
Of course I have dined with women.

495
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:39,337
These dinners in Paris...

496
00:39:39,448 --> 00:39:42,092
were charming?

497
00:39:42,201 --> 00:39:44,913
Yes.
(Chuckles)

498
00:39:45,021 --> 00:39:48,133
The food in Paris is very, very good.

499
00:39:48,243 --> 00:39:50,314
And the ladies?

500
00:39:51,398 --> 00:39:55,381
Oh -
(Chuckles Nervously, Mumbles)

501
00:39:57,877 --> 00:39:59,788
Well, I feel, by comparison...

502
00:39:59,891 --> 00:40:01,802
it must be very dull...

503
00:40:01,905 --> 00:40:04,011
dining with a queen.

504
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,405
<i>It would be the most delightful
experience of my life...</i>

505
00:40:07,511 --> 00:40:10,395
<i>dining with a queen, if-</i>

506
00:40:10,499 --> 00:40:13,577
- lf?
- If one...

507
00:40:13,688 --> 00:40:15,599
could forget -

508
00:40:15,702 --> 00:40:17,807
<i>That I am a queen.</i>

509
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:19,828
Yes.

510
00:40:21,854 --> 00:40:25,551
Very well. Forget it.

511
00:40:25,658 --> 00:40:29,594
I am no longer
Queen Louise I of Sylvania...

512
00:40:29,695 --> 00:40:32,186
but a woman.

513
00:40:32,298 --> 00:40:34,266
A mere woman.

514
00:40:35,835 --> 00:40:38,395
And you're meeting me
for the first time.

515
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:41,930
What would you do?

516
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:44,271
Oh.
(Chuckles)

517
00:40:44,377 --> 00:40:46,345
<i>What would you do?</i>

518
00:41:08,835 --> 00:41:11,360
Hello, Louise.
(Chuckles)

519
00:41:36,429 --> 00:41:39,296
All this the first time you meet?

520
00:41:39,398 --> 00:41:41,798

Oh, but you'll be a sensation.

629

Nonsense.

What's the matter with it?

Oh, no. No. That can't be.

639
00:51:13,138 --> 00:51:15,663
That was never taught at school.

640
00:51:19,178 --> 00:51:21,146
Still looks cross-eyed.

Maybe - Maybe it's a silly superstition...

He should've thought of that before.

And that to change that
causes trouble."

700

He does not see how any man

01:12:14,386 --> 01:12:16,859
He doesn't even
say good morning to me.

881
01:12:22,844 --> 01:12:25,750
Good morning.

882
01:12:25,853 --> 01:12:29,420
Well, that finishes my morning's work.

883
01:12:29,530 --> 01:12:31,433
What can I do now?

884
01:12:31,535 --> 01:12:33,439
I have already shaved.

885
01:12:33,541 --> 01:12:36,345
I had my hair cut yesterday.

886
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:38,615
There's nothing left.

887
01:12:38,723 --> 01:12:42,062
So, you're bored.

888
01:12:42,167 --> 01:12:45,336
All I'm waiting for now
is to have you tell me I'm neglecting you.

889
01:12:46,613 --> 01:12:49,314
Do you realize that
not once since we've been married...

890
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:51,483
have I left you alone at night?

891
01:12:52,596 --> 01:12:54,728
And I never will.

892
01:12:54,837 --> 01:12:58,575
Thank you.
It's very kind of you.

893
01:12:58,681 --> 01:13:00,983
And after this foreign loan
is arranged...

894
01:13:01,088 --> 01:13:03,059
I'm going to take you to Vienna...

895
01:13:03,161 --> 01:13:06,067
and buy you
a lot of nice new uniforms.

896
01:13:06,169 --> 01:13:09,907
That's it. You think all you have to do
is to buy me a few new uniforms...

897
01:13:10,014 --> 01:13:12,213
and I'll be satisfied.

898
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,953
That's the opinion
you have of me, is it?

899
01:13:15,062 --> 01:13:16,966
Oh, don't be silly, Alfred.

900
01:13:17,068 --> 01:13:20,704
Oh, I'm sick of being treated
as if I were a sort of plaything.

901
01:13:22,015 --> 01:13:25,013
- You're in a horrible mood today.
- Am I?

902
01:13:25,124 --> 01:13:27,597
(Rhythmic Tapping)

903
01:13:42,542 --> 01:13:46,782
(Coughing)

904
01:13:46,888 --> 01:13:49,360
- You have a cold?
- No.

905
01:13:50,698 --> 01:13:54,300
- (Coughing)
- Why do you cough?

906
01:13:54,409 --> 01:13:59,413
Listen, Louise. You have the power
to exclude me from all military affairs...

907
01:13:59,524 --> 01:14:01,427
from all cabinet meetings.

908
01:14:01,530 --> 01:14:05,838
But, please,
do not interfere with my coughing.

909
01:14:05,943 --> 01:14:07,847
I cough when I want to.

910
01:14:43,619 --> 01:14:47,221
At last, I've found something to do.

911
01:14:47,330 --> 01:14:49,529
I will repair this today.

912
01:14:49,636 --> 01:14:52,303
Yes. Immediately after-

913
01:14:54,149 --> 01:14:57,556
I almost forgot something
very important.

914
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,439
<i>Alfred, where are you going?</i>

915
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:06,712
Something very important.

916
01:15:06,819 --> 01:15:09,292
I am going to have breakfast.

917
01:15:30,087 --> 01:15:31,991
Where is my breakfast?

918
01:15:32,093 --> 01:15:33,997
May I remind Your Highness...

919
01:15:34,099 --> 01:15:37,541
that Her Majesty the queen
has not as yet appeared.

920
01:15:37,641 --> 01:15:40,514
- Well. And?
- Well, I'm sure Your Highness knows...

921
01:15:40,617 --> 01:15:44,755
that breakfast cannot be served
before the appearance of Her Majesty.

922
01:15:45,866 --> 01:15:48,031
I want my breakfast.

923
01:15:48,139 --> 01:15:50,374
<i>Your Highness, I am very sorry.</i>

924
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:53,511
<i>- We must wait.
- I can't wait.</i>

925
01:15:53,622 --> 01:15:56,722
I want my breakfast.
I'm hungry.

926
01:15:56,831 --> 01:16:00,467
Your Highness, I regret it,
but it's impossible to -

927
01:16:01,645 --> 01:16:04,950
Her Majesty will not appear
for breakfast this morning.

928
01:16:06,158 --> 01:16:08,825
Breakfast for His Highness.

929
01:16:08,933 --> 01:16:10,905
Please, Your Highness.

930
01:16:44,001 --> 01:16:46,765
- Do you speak French?
- No, Your Highness.

931
01:17:12,062 --> 01:17:14,030
(No Audible Dialogue)

932
01:17:45,629 --> 01:17:49,292
You're the only one in the palace
who looks up to me.

933
01:17:57,341 --> 01:18:00,037
#Just look at me #

934
01:18:00,144 --> 01:18:03,272
# I think my heart will break #

935
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:06,907
# Nobody seems to take me seriously #

936
01:18:07,951 --> 01:18:10,078
# Honestly #

937
01:18:10,187 --> 01:18:15,819
# I'm just as lonely
as a man can be #

938
01:18:17,728 --> 01:18:20,925
# The days mean nothing at all #

939
01:18:21,031 --> 01:18:24,000
# And when the shadows fall #

940
01:18:24,101 --> 01:18:29,437
# The moon is only
wasting time on me #

941
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:31,872
# Candidly #

942
01:18:31,975 --> 01:18:35,342
# There must be something
awful wrong #

943
01:18:35,446 --> 01:18:38,415
# With me #

944
01:18:38,515 --> 01:18:41,040
# I have a pair of hands #

945
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:43,051
# To hug and hold #

946
01:18:43,153 --> 01:18:46,645
# But nobody's using them now #

947
01:18:46,757 --> 01:18:49,089
# I've loads of love #

948
01:18:49,193 --> 01:18:51,093
# That could be told #

949
01:18:51,195 --> 01:18:54,358
# But nobody's using them now #

950
01:18:54,465 --> 01:18:56,660
# I've a world of time #

951
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:58,667
# That's all my own #

952
01:18:58,769 --> 01:19:02,330
# They say that you go silly
if you spend it alone #

953
01:19:02,439 --> 01:19:05,875
# I'm telling the truth
I'm just wasting my youth #

954
01:19:05,976 --> 01:19:09,810
# 'Cause nobody's using it now
No, no, no, no #

955
01:19:09,913 --> 01:19:13,076
# Nobody's using it now #

956
01:19:13,183 --> 01:19:15,276
# There's a bridal suite #

957
01:19:15,386 --> 01:19:17,286
# In gold and blue #

958
01:19:17,388 --> 01:19:20,846
# But nobody's using it now #

959
01:19:20,958 --> 01:19:24,917
# I've learned to wear pajamas too #

960
01:19:25,028 --> 01:19:28,327
# What's the use
of wearing them now #

961
01:19:28,432 --> 01:19:30,366
# I've sown wild oats #

962
01:19:30,467 --> 01:19:32,367
# I have indeed #

963
01:19:32,469 --> 01:19:35,768
# But now that I've stopped sowing them
I'm going to seed #

964
01:19:35,873 --> 01:19:39,502
# For years and for years
I've had great ideas #

965
01:19:39,610 --> 01:19:43,307
# But nobody's using them now
No, no, no, no #

966
01:19:43,414 --> 01:19:46,508
# Nobody's using them now #

967
01:19:46,617 --> 01:19:50,678
# I have a big settee
with patent springs #

968
01:19:53,891 --> 01:19:58,123
# I've some pleasing ways and -
(Chuckles) other things #

969
01:20:01,165 --> 01:20:05,067
# I'm a family man
who's out of sorts #

970
01:20:05,169 --> 01:20:08,536
# I'm just a loving papa
to a great lot of thoughts #

971
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:12,234
# I blush to admit
I've still plenty of"it" #

972
01:20:12,342 --> 01:20:15,641
# But nobody's using it now
No, no, no, no #

973
01:20:15,746 --> 01:20:19,238
# Nobody's using it now
Zum, zum ##

974
01:20:20,851 --> 01:20:23,217
<i>(People Chattering)</i>

975
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:26,812
<i>(Woman)
...try to see the prince.</i>

976
01:20:26,924 --> 01:20:29,757
<i>Isn't there standing room?
Oh, but I must see the prince.</i>

977
01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:32,328
<i>(Chattering Continues)</i>

978
01:20:34,164 --> 01:20:36,064
Oh? Oh.

979
01:20:36,166 --> 01:20:38,293
Oh, is that so?

980
01:20:38,402 --> 01:20:40,563
Mm-hmm. All right.

981
01:20:40,671 --> 01:20:42,571
The moment it was announced
that Your Majesty...

982
01:20:42,673 --> 01:20:44,641
would attend the opening
of the opera in person...

983
01:20:44,741 --> 01:20:46,800
the place was completely sold out.

984
01:20:46,910 --> 01:20:48,878
(Ministers Chattering)

985
01:20:48,979 --> 01:20:54,815
- Your Majesty is still the biggest drawing card in the country.
- (Minister) Yes, indeed, Your Majesty.

986
01:20:54,918 --> 01:20:58,115
Have the spotlights been focused
on the entrance to the opera house?

987
01:20:58,222 --> 01:21:00,122
Oh, yes, Your Majesty.

988
01:21:00,224 --> 01:21:02,886
Twelve motion picture cameras
will photograph the arrival...

989
01:21:02,993 --> 01:21:05,052
of Your Majesty and the prince consort.

990
01:21:05,162 --> 01:21:09,030
The crowd will cheer
and press forward with such enthusiasm...

991
01:21:09,132 --> 01:21:13,000
that it can be kept in check only
by the most heroic efforts of the police.

992
01:21:13,103 --> 01:21:15,162
And has all this been well rehearsed?

993
01:21:15,272 --> 01:21:17,172
Oh, yes, Your Majesty.

994
01:21:17,274 --> 01:21:21,108
The crowd is the same one
that we used at Your Majesty's wedding.

995
01:21:21,211 --> 01:21:23,771
They all know their parts perfectly.

996
01:21:23,881 --> 01:21:26,349
Good. Go on.

997
01:21:26,450 --> 01:21:30,887
When Your Majesty and the prince consort
appear in the royal box...

998
01:21:30,988 --> 01:21:33,149
the whole audience will rise.

999
01:21:33,257 --> 01:21:35,953
For two minutes,
we will have silent homage.

1000
01:21:36,059 --> 01:21:41,395
Your Majesty and the prince consort will
reward your loyal subjects with happy smiles.

1001
01:21:41,498 --> 01:21:44,228
You are both in the best of humor.

1002
01:21:45,669 --> 01:21:48,297
- In the best of humor?
- Oh, yes, Your Majesty.

1003
01:21:48,405 --> 01:21:51,238
And does the prince consort know
he's to be in the best of humor?

1004
01:21:51,341 --> 01:21:53,241
Well - (Coughs)
Your Majesty, I-I -

1005
01:21:53,343 --> 01:21:56,244
- Well, you'd better tell him, to be safe.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

1006
01:22:04,321 --> 01:22:06,380
Your Majesty frightens us.

1007
01:22:06,490 --> 01:22:10,790
Tonight is your first opportunity of showing
your matrimonial happiness to the public.

1008
01:22:10,894 --> 01:22:14,694
- And if the prince consort does not
smile in joy- - It will mean disaster.

1009
01:22:14,798 --> 01:22:18,632
<i>The diplomatic representatives of the whole
world will be guests in the royal box.</i>

1010
01:22:18,735 --> 01:22:21,033
And unfortunately,
the Afghan ambassador too.

1011
01:22:21,138 --> 01:22:24,574
And if he sees any coolness between you,
he'll report it to Afghanistan.

1012
01:22:24,675 --> 01:22:27,007
Well, let him.

1013
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:30,079
But surely Your Majesty knows that
if Afghanistan hears anything...

1014
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:32,148
Baluchistan hears it too.

1015
01:22:32,249 --> 01:22:35,548
And if Baluchistan hears it,
then all Persia will know it.

1016
01:22:35,652 --> 01:22:38,450
And what is talked of in Persia
spreads all over Turkey.

1017
01:22:38,555 --> 01:22:41,820
And when anything is known in Turkey,
the Armenians get onto it immediately.

1018
01:22:41,925 --> 01:22:44,155
And you know how many Armenians
go to America.

1019
01:22:44,261 --> 01:22:48,425
So if Wall Street hears of a rift
in the matrimonial happiness of Your Majesty...

1020
01:22:48,532 --> 01:22:51,330
it will stop all credits
and we do not get the loan.

1021
01:22:51,435 --> 01:22:54,199
- And without that loan, we are broke.
- (Ministers) Broke!

1022
01:22:54,304 --> 01:22:56,204
<i>(Door Slams)</i>

1023
01:22:56,306 --> 01:23:00,299
So, unless I have a smile on my face
tonight, we are broke.

1024
01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:03,902
<i>- (Ministers) Yes, Your Highness.
- And you call yourselves statesmen.</i>

1025
01:23:04,014 --> 01:23:06,141
Borrowing money
is all that you're able to do.

1026
01:23:06,249 --> 01:23:09,275
Prince Alfred,
what are you permitting yourself?

1027
01:23:09,386 --> 01:23:12,446
I permit myself
to make the following suggestion.

1028
01:23:12,556 --> 01:23:16,583
We do not need a loan.
We have enough natural resources.

1029
01:23:19,196 --> 01:23:23,064
There is my plan
for the national budget.

1030
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:25,794
(Whispered Chattering)

1031
01:23:25,902 --> 01:23:30,703
I have worked out everything -
in my sleepless days.

1032
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:36,606
The country can be saved
without a loan.

1033
01:23:39,716 --> 01:23:41,684
Go on.

1034
01:23:41,785 --> 01:23:43,912
Read it.

1035
01:23:44,021 --> 01:23:45,989
It includes everything.

1036
01:23:48,492 --> 01:23:50,653
Even your dressmakers' bills.

1037
01:24:12,816 --> 01:24:18,550
I am not permitted to receive suggestions
in the affairs of state...

1038
01:24:18,655 --> 01:24:21,180
from the prince consort.

1039
01:24:21,291 --> 01:24:23,259
Not even when they are good?

1040
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:25,328
Not even then.

1041
01:24:30,701 --> 01:24:34,193
- Do you speak French?
- Yes, Your Highness.

1042
01:24:34,304 --> 01:24:36,204
Too bad.

1043
01:24:37,307 --> 01:24:40,640
<i>Prince Alfred, I must ask you
once and for all...</i>

1044
01:24:40,744 --> 01:24:43,235
not to interfere in affairs of state.

1045
01:24:43,346 --> 01:24:45,246
I know.

1046
01:24:45,348 --> 01:24:48,476
I'm Your Majesty's husband
and nothing else.

1047
01:24:50,387 --> 01:24:53,288
Prince Alfred,
you may leave the room.

1048
01:25:12,109 --> 01:25:14,077

Well, there is no use

No. No use at all.

1253

I suppose so too.

But how am I going to punish you?

1256
01:44:23,626 --> 01:44:25,526
- And you must be punished.
- Yes.

1257

- Yes.

01:44:32,167 --> 01:44:36,103
An awful punishment.
Let me see.

Yes.

Sit down.

1265
01:44:54,323 --> 01:44:57,553
If I were in your place, I'd say:

1266
01:44:57,660 --> 01:45:00,857
"Louise, I don't want a divorce.

1267
01:45:00,963 --> 01:45:04,296
- I love you too much for that."
- No, no, no, no, no.

1268
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:06,799
But I'd say: " Louise...

1269
01:45:06,902 --> 01:45:09,666
"you can't order me around
any longer.

1274
01:45:21,951 --> 01:45:25,250

"from night till morning."

1281
01:45:54,616 --> 01:45:56,516
