1
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,661
- Thanks for the lesson.
- No, thank you for the lesson.

2
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:42,024
- Slats, why aren't you at work?
- Sis, I'm waiting for the boss.

3
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:43,933
- You been fired again?
- Certainly not.

4
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,666
I want him to give you a raise
for the publicity I got you.

5
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:50,699
Now, look... "Molly McCarthy,
Miramar Instructress says,

6
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:53,576
<i>'I'm saving money to go to Bixby,
the college of my dreams. "'</i>

7
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,309
- You see it?
- I've seen nothing else for three days.

8
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,909
"Hello, Miss College.
What do you hear from Einstein?"

9
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,180
What's wrong with that?

10
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,381
Why, I'll publicize you
right into the bright lights.

11
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:05,687
Or into a padded cell. Why don't
you mix truth with your publicity?

12
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,659
This is nothing but the truth.
Look at that.

13
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:10,185
I found out there really is
a college by the name of Bixby.

14
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,255
I found it out, on the level.
Where are you going?

15
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,734
Home, before you publicize me into
playing shortstop for the Brooklyn Dodgers.

16
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:17,759
Wait a minute,
that's not a bad idea.

17
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,296
I'll break every front page in the country
with that story, or my name is not...

18
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,400
- McCarthy!
- Oh, hello, boss.

19
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,206
- Gold-bricking again, huh?
- No.

20
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,236
- Then you're still working here?
- I hope so.

21
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,679
- Then get to work.
- Okay.

22
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:31,183
Make sure your pal gets to work too,
or you're both fired.

23
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:32,707
Okay, boss.

24
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:40,587
- Dance, Mr. McCarthy?
- Yes, surely.

25
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,300
Is Mr. Quackenbush working
this evening?

26
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,327
He's around some place.
I don't know where.

27
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,874
- Hello.
- How do you do?

28
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,708
- Let's sit this one out.
- Sit it out?

29
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:02,613
Thank you ever so much!
Sit down.

30
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,776
You know,
I really don't like dancing,

31
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,876
because it's nothing
but hugging set to music.

32
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,083
- What don't you like about it?
- The music.

33
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,920
Oh, my!

34
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,294
Ah-ha!
You snake in the grass.

35
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,194
You wolf in sheep's clothing.

36
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,222
You...
at last, I've found you!

37
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,496
You're the rat who lured
my wife away from me!

38
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,231
I'm going to teach you a lesson
you'll never forget.

39
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:29,272
And as for you...
you are no longer my wife.

40
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,334
- No longer your wife?!
- Yes.

41
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,311
I never was your wife!

42
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,405
Huh?
Why, you...

43
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,786
Remarkable resemblance!

44
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,118
I could have sworn
you were my wife.

45
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,181
Boy, do I feel silly!

46
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,489
How do you think I feel?

47
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,927
May I apologize
on the floor?

48
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,625
Yes.

49
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:55,133
Why don't you apologize to me?
I'm on the floor.

50
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,968
What in the world are
you into now? Come on.

51
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,803
Come over here. What are you
doing? What's wrong with you?

52
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,502
You tell me you're
too tired to dance.

53
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:06,034
As soon as my back is turned,
you start playing in the sand.

54
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,378
Never mind that. Now stop
this nonsense and get to work.

55
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,618
- Hello, Mr. Quackenbush.
- How do you do?

56
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,951
Shall we dance, or would
you rather sit this one out?

57
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,982
I sat the last one out.
Let's dance. Thank you.

58
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:23,052
Ah-ha!
You home wrecker!

59
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,497
For weeks, I've tried to find you
and now I've caught you two together.

60
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:29,797
How dare you try to steal
my wife away from me, huh?

61
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,268
Did he try
to steal your wife?

62
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,240
You know he tried to...

63
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,077
Well, you look
just like my wife.

64
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,016
Oh, I beg your pardon.

65
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,884
<i>It's all a mistake.
I regret it exceedingly.</i>

66
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,320
Shall we finish
this dance?

67
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:51,823
Yes.

68
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,292
I hope you don't think
I'm drunk.

69
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,954
It's quite all right.

70
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:57,758
I'm a little potted myself.

71
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:01,028
What, again? Didn't I tell you not
to play in the sand? Now get up.

72
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,763
Get up on your feet. Didn't I
tell you not to play in the sand?

73
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,395
- Who's playing in the sand?
- You!

74
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,463
Listen here to me.
I'm not playing in no sand.

75
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,974
- What were you doing?
- Bad eyes.

76
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,499
- Now it's bad eyes.
- Not me... some crazy guy around here.

77
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:14,570
Every time the guy sees me with
a girl, he thinks it's his wife.

78
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:18,448
- So what? - He says to me,
like this, he says "Ha-ha!

79
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,748
You're the snake
in wolf's clothing.

80
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,687
You're the wolf in the grass.

81
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,816
How dare you steal my wife
away from me?!"

82
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:28,884
- What are you ta...
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

83
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,692
- Stealing this little fellow's wife!
- Madam, madam!

84
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:39,230
Whoo,
are you "destructful. "

85
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,467
- Who was she?
- That must be that crazy guy's wife.

86
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,441
- Ah-ha!
- That's him.

87
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,312
Man:
Hey! What happened here?

88
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:53,376
Now, if you say, "Ah-ah,"
I'll knock you down again.

89
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,319
Hey, wait a minute.
You hit the boss.

90
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,419
Let's get out of here.

91
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,722
Come on, come on.
All right, break it up.

92
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,784
Break it up here.

93
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,359
- Wait a minute, we'll take this car.
- It don't belong to us.

94
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,526
What's the difference?
Get in there. Go ahead.

95
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:11,002
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.
Start it up.

96
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,969
Hey, come back with that car!

97
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,634
Boy, I'm glad
we got out of that jam.

98
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,906
I hope we can get this car back
before people miss it.

99
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,140
<i>Dispatcher:
Calling cars 11, 12, 14 and 15.</i>

100
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,308
<i>Cars 11, 12, 14 and 15.</i>

101
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,750
<i>Be on the lookout for car 13.</i>

102
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,777
<i>It has just been stolen.</i>

103
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,152
- Mmm.
- How do you like that?

104
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:33,158
Somebody stole a police car.
I feel sorry for that chump.

105
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:37,060
<i>Dispatcher: Here is a description
of the men who stole the police car:</i>

106
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:40,657
<i>Number one... medium height,
slender, blue eyes;</i>

107
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,828
<i>number two...
short, fat and stupid.</i>

108
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,065
- A couple of chumps.
- Yeah, we don't know 'em.

109
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,403
Blow your horn
and get around that taxicab.

110
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:51,274
<i>Uh-oh, must be a fire.</i>

111
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,778
- Fire?
- The siren's on. Somebody's coming I guess.

112
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:56,509
- Come on.
- I don't see any fire.

113
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,983
- I pulled over a little bit anyway.
- Well, all right.

114
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,879
Get around that taxicab,
will you, please?

115
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,459
Here comes
the fire department again.

116
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:11,020
Wait a minute. You're the one
that stole the police car.

117
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,224
Me?
Yes.

118
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,427
- I stole a police car?
- This is a police car.

119
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,335
- This is? See you later.
- You're going to drive this car!

120
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,532
Now drive it back.
The police will understand.

121
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,268
You sure the cops
are gonna understand?

122
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,435
- They'll understand.
- Then you drive it.

123
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:25,739
- I... come here.
- Quit it!

124
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,372
- Drive the car. Go on, drive the car.
- How can I drive?!

125
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,609
- Drive the car, go ahead.
- How can I drive?!

126
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,618
Drive the car.

127
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,119
Go on, will ya?

128
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,621
There you are, you got it.
Here's the wheel over here.

129
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,216
Come on!
Go ahead.

130
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:41,556
Look out...
look out where you're driving.

131
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,759
- Pardon me, gentlemen.
- Go on, beat it. We're busy.

132
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:52,237
- We brought your car back.
- I haven't got time to listen to that ki...

133
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,296
it's them!
Grab them!

134
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,271
Wait a minute.
What's going on here, men?

135
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,175
These are the men
that stole our police car.

136
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,578
No, no, no, we didn't steal
it. We took it by mistake.

137
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:04,310
Didn't we bring it back? Doesn't
that prove that we're honest?

138
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,148
I can see that. Most men would
have run away. Release them, boys.

139
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,313
Oh, no, not until we pay for
the gasoline we used.

140
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,949
- That won't be necessary.
- Chief, we insist.

141
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,118
After all, we used your gas.
We want to pay for it.

142
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,025
Very well.
Measure it, Flanagan.

143
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,963
- Measure it, Flanagan.
- Yes.

144
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,659
Measure it!

145
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,904
About a sixth of a gallon.

146
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:31,569
Oh, a sixth of a gallon.

147
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,079
Well, I think I have enough
here to cover that, thank you.

148
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,671
- There you are, Chief.
- Thank you.

149
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,616
It's a pleasure to meet fine
conscientious citizens like you.

150
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,118
Thank you, Chief.

151
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,915
- Have one of my cigars.
- Thank you.

152
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:44,650
By the way, just a minute. Tut-tut.
Have one of my matches.

153
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,555
- Thank you.
- Excuse me, please.

154
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:49,561
Have a match.
That's it. That's the idea.

155
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,119
Fine smoke, right?

156
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:04,139
- Hurry up, Oliver!
- But what will you boys do?

157
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:05,700
That's all right.
We'll get along.

158
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,270
<i>We'd better get along right now!</i>

159
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,111
- Cops!
- Out the fire escape!

160
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,946
<i>- Oliver! Oliver!
- Come on!</i>

161
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,645
Oliver! No!
Out!

162
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,984
Oliver, there's
no fire escape there!

163
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:19,048
I just found that out!

164
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,025
Hurry up, Oliver.

165
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,460
All right, all right.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

166
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,521
Are you all right?
Get up on your feet.

167
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,760
<i>Quick, hide!</i>

168
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,825
Come on, hurry up!

169
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,569
- Miss McCarthy?
- Yes?

170
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,942
My name is Benson...
Dean Benson of Bixby College.

171
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,139
May I come in?
Why, yes.

172
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,772
Thank you.

173
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:45,010
I read the magazine article
about your ambition and I...

174
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,746
- How do you do?
- All: Hello.

175
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,755
This is my brother, Mr. McCarthy,
and his friend Oliver Quackenbush.

176
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,154
- How do you do?
- Mm-hmm.

177
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,714
This is the dean.
The who?

178
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,020
The dean.
Dean.

179
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,527
Dean?
Dean.

180
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,722
Did you ever pitch
for the St. Louis Cardinals?

181
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,561
No. As I was saying, Miss McCarthy,
I read the magazine article

182
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,194
and I'm here to award you
the Bixby Foundation Scholarship.

183
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:05,703
- I'm afraid I can't...
- Wait a minute. What is it worth?

184
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:08,138
Well, it covers the tuition
and registration fees,

185
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,608
room and board,
and all necessary expenses.

186
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,736
- Both: She'll take it!
- Oh, no, I won't!

187
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,144
You see, Slats and Oliver
just lost their jobs

188
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,172
and we're sort of dependent
on each other.

189
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,911
I couldn't possibly
leave them.

190
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,476
That's very loyal of you.
What sort of work do you do?

191
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,284
Practically anything...
creative, executive.

192
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,188
I don't know whether
this would interest you,

193
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:28,420
but the school does need
two assistant caretakers.

194
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,395
- Both: Caretakers?!
- See here!

195
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,364
<i>- The job pays room and board.
- Room and board!</i>

196
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,664
You want us just to work
for room and board?

197
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,433
Both:
We'll take it!

198
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,601
Splendid! I'll expect the three
of you at Bixby tomorrow afternoon.

199
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,009
- We'll be there!
- Bye.

200
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,536
I should have asked him for passes
for the football game.

201
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:51,880
They don't play football there.
That's a girl's college, Bixby.

202
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,181
There's two or three hundred
girls up there.

203
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,881
- Two or three hundred girls?
- Sure!

204
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,183
At Bixby?
Yeah.

205
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,622
Girl's school?
Mm-hmm.

206
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,422
- We're gonna be the caretakers?
Just you and I? - Mm-hmm.

207
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,894
- Caretakers for two or three hundred girls?
- So what?

208
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:27,819
Diane, where's Benson?
Where's he hiding?

209
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,651
- Well, isn't he in his office?
- No, he is not in his office.

210
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,318
You know his hideouts. You
know where he goes. Where is he?

211
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,020
Now, I tell you, Dad,
you run along,

212
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,086
and when I find him,
I'll have him phone you.

213
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,256
Phone me nothing!
Have you seen this?

214
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,664
"Miramar Molly
Gets Bixby Scholarship. "

215
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,896
<i>- Yes, isn't it splendid?
- Splendid?</i>

216
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:46,996
To give Bixby's one scholarship
to a Miramar Molly?!

217
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,701
That's what the dean said.
Why should we continue to waste it

218
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,734
on girls able
to pay their own tuition?

219
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:55,975
You act more like
your mother's mother every day!

220
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,044
<i>Diane:
Larry! Shh!</i>

221
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,055
Get back, get back!

222
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,387
- Well, what's up?
- Dad's blood pressure!

223
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,824
Found out about
the McCarthy Scholarship, hmm?

224
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,021
Well, I might as well go
and have it out with him.

225
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,893
No, Larry,
wait till he cools off.

226
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,762
I don't believe in
dodging trouble.

227
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,824
Well, please...
for my sake?

228
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,010
I say... you, there!
Just a minute!

229
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,104
Just a minute! We don't want
you in the picture!

230
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,671
There's not going to be
any picture!

231
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:32,775
That's what I said... there ain't gonna
be any picture with your face in it.

232
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,480
Will you let me alone? I'm
Chairman of the Board of Regents!

233
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:39,218
- Then go get a chair and sit down!
- Come here, you!

234
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,125
You come down from there!
You come down from there I say!

235
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,721
We're not going to have
anything like this here at Bixby!

236
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,925
You're coming down
off of there, that's all!

237
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,866
Now you come down!

238
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:52,132
- Take your hands off that girl!
- Give me those films!

239
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,036
Wait a minute!
Give me back my camera!

240
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,870
Johnson!
Throw them out!

241
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,008
I'll have you
in Juvenile Court!

242
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,444
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
what's the meaning of all this?

243
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,744
More vulgar notoriety,
that's the meaning of it!

244
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,650
I caught this "Miramar Molly"
with these magazine photographers.

245
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:09,848
They're not photographers. This man
is her brother. That one is his friend.

246
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,686
<i>I hired them last night
as caretakers.</i>

247
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,989
- Yes, we didn't mean any harm.
- Well, perhaps not.

248
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:17,757
But anyway, I want these films
destroyed! Get rid of them, Johnson.

249
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,128
- Right.
- Give me those!

250
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,690
Johnson, show your
new assistants to their quarters.

251
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,635
Assistants, huh?

252
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,071
We'll have no more of your cheap
publicity tricks here, Miss McCarthy!

253
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:30,905
- You won't have...
- Will you show Miss McCarthy to the dormitory?

254
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,138
Yes, indeed.
This way, Miss McCarthy.

255
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,942
And as for you,
young man...

256
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,039
Suppose we hold our discussions
in my office?

257
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,676
- Very well.
- This way, Mr. Kirkland.

258
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,022
Hello, chubby.

259
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:48,583
Excuse me, you dropped
your handkerchief.

260
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:51,095
Get dirty.
Better pick it up.

261
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,963
Hi, pudgy.

262
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,063
Excuse me.

263
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:04,269
Look,
no flirting around here.

264
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,279
If you pick up a girl's
handkerchief, you're fired.

265
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,338
Hey, you're too rough.

266
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,827
Hello, butterball.
You're new here, aren't you?

267
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,264
My name's Patty.
What's yours?

268
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,290
Never mind, you can
tell me some other time.

269
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,667
See you later.

270
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,798
She's cute.

271
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,501
As head of the Board of Regents,

272
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,340
I demand that our sacred
traditions must be upheld.

273
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,973
Our old methods, our tried
and proven methods...

274
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:46,178
Are antiquated, and the condition
of Bixby when I took over proves it.

275
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,686
Not one modern course,
not one up-to-date method.

276
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,383
Not one-fourth the enrollment
needed to meet expenses.

277
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,755
And may I ask
who has met those expenses?

278
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:56,420
Who has carried overdue
mortgages for 20 years?

279
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:57,952
You have.

280
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,465
But if you'd just let me
make this a real school...

281
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,364
Bixby was good enough
for my mother.

282
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,993
And her mother.

283
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,971
And her mother's mother,
and her mother's mother's mother!

284
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:08,904
Come on.

285
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:13,206
This is
the caretaker's quarters.

286
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,509
You should get a caretaker
to take care of it.

287
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,947
That's just
what you're for.

288
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,645
- Get busy and clean up.
- Okay.

289
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,916
- Come on, get busy.
- Hey, you.

290
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,449
There's only one reason
why I don't punch you in the nose,

291
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,224
and that's because
I'm bigger than you are.

292
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,128
I'm bigger than you are.

293
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:34,792
That's a better reason.

294
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,698
Get to it!

295
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,395
Now get busy.

296
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,374
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

297
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,343
- Broom.
- Go ahead. Here.

298
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,409
What a mess.

299
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,881
Ahh! Not in there.

300
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,577
Put it in the wastepaper basket.

301
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:29,720
Hey, Slats.
What?

302
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,155
Hold that.
Hold it easy.

303
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,489
What are you doing?

304
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,357
Thank you, again.

305
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,363
What are you doing?

306
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,332
The man said clean up
the place, didn't he?

307
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,096
I'll clean this room up.
You come here.

308
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,966
You go in the kitchen
and wash the dishes.

309
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,529
Why don't I take the dishes and
throw them in the spare room?

310
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,837
- Go in the kitchen! Wash the dishes.
- All right!

311
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:50,967
Go ahead in there.

312
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,342
What are you doing?
What are you doing now?

313
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,144
Go into the kitchen
and wash the dishes.

314
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,309
Go ahead.

315
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:11,160
Slats! Slats! Slats!

316
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:16,431
- What are you doing? What are you doing now?
- Get me out! Get me out!

317
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,328
There you are.

318
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,238
What are you doing in there?
Get out of there. Get out of that.

319
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:25,141
If you want to wash your face, why
don't you use the sink over there?

320
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:28,203
- I mean, after all...
- Never mind. Get on the job and clean up this place.

321
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,841
Get that grease spot off that
wall and wash those dishes...

322
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,407
I won't, I won't, I won't!
I will.

323
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:36,251
- Take care of that pan under the icebox. Get with it!
- I just wanted to be stubborn.

324
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:40,190
When I said, "I won't, I won't," I knew I
was going to say, "I will. " I usually do.

325
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,815
Window was closed.

326
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,136
Fresh water.

327
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,074
Good fresh water.

328
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,752
<i>Hey, Oliver.
Hey, Oliver,</i>

329
00:19:55,794 --> 00:20:00,288
<i>if we can hold onto this job,
we'll be in the dough in no time.</i>

330
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,960
<i>- I'm in it now.
- You're in the dough?</i>

331
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,401
I'm wearing it.

332
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,508
What are you doing now? What are
you doing now? What is this here?

333
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,739
- What did you do?
How'd you get into this?

334
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,712
- Slats!
- Wait a minute!

335
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,614
What did you get into now?

336
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,619
Get this thing off your feet.

337
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,281
<i>Get this thing out of the way.</i>

338
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:28,054
- Look at this mess.
- Now, wait a minute!

339
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,584
Quiet. All right,
put 'em back. Put 'em back.

340
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,927
Put 'em back.

341
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,592
Put 'em back there.
That's it.

342
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,067
All right, put 'em back
where they belong.

343
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,570
Here, I'll help you.
Hold on to me.

344
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:42,233
Get down.
Go on, get down.

345
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:44,174
Come on.
Come on, get down.

346
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,074
Get down!

347
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,944
Look at this mess you're into.
Throw those away.

348
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:53,008
Throw 'em away. Tell me,
what's the matter? What is it?

349
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:55,178
Lookit... molasses, glue.

350
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,552
Gimme that. Gimme it.

351
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,557
- Oh, good.
- There. Now, look at this.

352
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,149
Huh?
Look at this.

353
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,661
- Well, let's both wear one.
- Never mind that.

354
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:06,562
Gimme that one.
Gimme that. There you are.

355
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,623
- Huh?
- Look what you did.

356
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,431
Yeah.
Take that.

357
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,097
Get a load of this mess.

358
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,402
Hold it. Hold it. I'll get
you out. I'll get you out.

359
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,738
Get it off.
There you are.

360
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,176
- Now take a hold of this.
- Okay.

361
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,203
Hold on to it!

362
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:24,147
What a mess.

363
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:26,377
- Hey!
- What's the matter?

364
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:28,978
Well, get it...
get it off.

365
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,992
I don't know what
I'll ever do with you.

366
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,789
Always getting me
into trouble.

367
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:39,024
You're always doing something
that's all... get rid of it.

368
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,497
Throw it out...

369
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:43,057
- Hey...
- Here, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Turn around.

370
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,932
- I can't get the legs open.
- Turn around.

371
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,666
- I can't get my legs open.
- Turn around! I'll straighten you up.

372
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,936
- No, no! Look!
- There, all right.

373
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:53,103
- There you are, here. Hold it.
- Hey!

374
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,942
Never mind that.
Take this off.

375
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:59,248
Get it off the pants!

376
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:02,515
- Turn around.
- Get my hand off the pants!

377
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:05,216
My hand off the pants!

378
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,986
Hold still.

379
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,761
Oh, good.

380
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:13,128
Put that... put that down!

381
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,224
Turn around.
Here, I'll get you out of that.

382
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:18,333
There you are.

383
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,031
Look at this mess.

384
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:23,508
- That's good.
- Well... look at this here.

385
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,203
What are you doing?

386
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,108
Now, look.
Now, listen.

387
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:30,444
- Don't get any on my face 'cause I don't go for it.
- Go wash those dishes.

388
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,211
Look at this mess.

389
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:59,469
Ah! Wash the dishes.

390
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:04,578
Slats!

391
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:21,292
Do they sing like this
every night?

392
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,857
Yeah... they're in a rut.

393
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:27,463
It's perfect... the whole
college, the girls... everything.

394
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:30,907
You should have seen it last semester
before Benson gave it a facelift...

395
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:33,843
no athletics, no make-up,
no singing, no nothing.

396
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:36,177
The dean really did a job
around here.

397
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:39,581
- He's nice, isn't he?
- Hmm. Remind me to ask Diane.

398
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:42,178
Diane? Oh.

399
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:48,882
All:
Someday

400
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:53,921
We will remember

401
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:57,401
This night of nights

402
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:05,673
All filled
with sweet memories

403
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:15,779
We'll remember
how the stars danced in the sky

404
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:23,250
You will recall
touching the moon

405
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:27,061
And so will I

406
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:33,128
Oh, somewhere

407
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:37,972
Out of the nowhere

408
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:41,308
We'll close our eyes

409
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:49,185
And be here over again

410
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:55,626
Woman:
Forever and ever

411
00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:03,465
We'll keep
this night tucked away

412
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:15,903
All: Just to remember again someday

413
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:20,247
Remember, remember

414
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:27,487
Remember again

415
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:38,027
Woman:
Someda-ay.

416
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:42,538
You've just got time to clean
this room up before class.

417
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:45,566
That's all I heard for two weeks
is, "Clean this up, clean that up,"

418
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,703
"Scrub the floor,"
"Wash the dishes," "Do this,"

419
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,976
- "Mow the lawn and rake up the leaves. "
- All right.

420
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,950
- While all he does is shoot dice.
- How do you know?

421
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,545
I found these in his room.

422
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:59,455
<i>- Girl: Oliver!
- Hey, hide those dice.</i>

423
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:01,254
Hurry up. Hide 'em!

424
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:07,654
Oliver, I'm sorry I couldn't
keep our date last night.

425
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:10,566
Are you mad at me?

426
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:13,662
Oh, Oliver, speak to me.

427
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:16,503
What can I do to make you
accept my apology?

428
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,211
Of course I'll kiss you.

429
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,450
Oh, gee, I'm late.
See you later. Goodbye.

430
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,852
What're you doing?

431
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,957
What's the matter?

432
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,367
What's the matter?
Hey...

433
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,037
did you swallow
those dice?

434
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,637
Come on, you guys,
quit stallin'.

435
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,006
- What's the matter with him?
- He swallowed your dice.

436
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:58,538
My dice!
I paid two bucks for those dice.

437
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:00,448
I could roll a seven
any time I wanted to!

438
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:03,545
- All right!
- I'm gonna get 'em out of you if I have to choke 'em out.

439
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:05,556
Stand up there.
Stand still!

440
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,524
- What's the matter?
- Hold still.

441
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,685
Mm-mmm.

442
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:11,628
Six.

443
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:14,530
- Bet you five bucks I can make it.
- That's a bet.

444
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:17,057
- Put it down there.
- Slats, what're you doing?

445
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:19,263
Quiet! Come here.

446
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:23,299
- Slats!
- Get in there. Get in there. Hurry up.

447
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:24,808
Get in there.
Get in there.

448
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,902
- Turn around and hold still.
- Now, let's see.

449
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,913
Two threes!
I made it the hard way!

450
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:32,712
What do you think of that, hey?
Marvelous! Let it ride, go ahead!

451
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:34,685
- Okay.
- Put it down. Cover it all.

452
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:37,779
- I'm the only one ridin'. Up and down the joint.
- There you are. Come here.

453
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,483
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Wait a minute... hey!

454
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:41,458
I want a better shake
than that for my dough.

455
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,256
- Now, look!
- Come here! Come here!

456
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:46,354
- Ahhh!
- Get up here on that table!

457
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:47,922
<i>That's it.</i>

458
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:50,594
- How do you operate this thing?
- I'll operate it.

459
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,660
You're gonna operate on who?
Now, cut it out!

460
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,729
- Get down!
- Mama!

461
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:56,741
Slats, no more.
I can't take it, Slats!

462
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:58,538
Get your feet together.

463
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:02,342
Slats! Slats!
Get me off, Slats!

464
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,779
No!

465
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,443
I'm afraid, Slats.
Get me off!

466
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,952
Get up. Get up.

467
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:16,222
- I win.
- Boxcars.

468
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,221
That was very entertaining,
Professor,

469
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:08,021
but just what does that
teach the other pupils?

470
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:12,018
Miss Carroll, will you please analyze
the composition you just heard?

471
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,690
Starting the first movement,
moderato,

472
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:18,327
<i>the second movement is lento,
tres passione,</i>

473
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,530
<i>with the sixth bar played
espressivo.</i>

474
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:23,665
<i>The balance of the composition
is interpreted as indicated,</i>

475
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:27,200
<i>namely, en glissant,
ad libitum, rubato</i>

476
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:31,113
<i>avec beaucoup d'expression,
and allegro molto vivace,</i>

477
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:33,913
with a cross indicating
pizzicato with the left hand

478
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,318
and a chromatic scale glide
with one finger.

479
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:42,957
I'd like to hear our scholarship
student repeat that description.

480
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:46,020
Will you please,
Miss McCarthy?

481
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:50,091
- Well, I...
- Go ahead, Miss McCarthy, repeat that statement.

482
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:57,033
Well...

483
00:32:57,075 --> 00:33:01,569
<i>well, beginning with the first
movement, moderato,</i>

484
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:04,240
<i>the second movement is lento,
tres passione,</i>

485
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:06,375
<i>with the sixth bar played
espressivo.</i>

486
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:09,147
The balance of the composition
is interpreted as indicated,

487
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:12,179
<i>namely, en glissant,
ad libitum, rubato</i>

488
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:16,785
<i>avec beaucoup d'expression,
and allegro molto vivace</i>

489
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,956
<i>with a cross indicating
pizzicato with the left hand</i>

490
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,330
<i>and a chromatic scale glide
with one finger.</i>

491
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,428
Remember to break fast
when I fake to the guard.

492
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,632
How can I break fast
when my bustle's dragging?

493
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,141
You want a real workout,
try guarding that McCarthy.

494
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,699
Where'd you learn
to play like that?

495
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,837
She said something
about the YWCA in Brooklyn.

496
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:37,473
I'll have to hand it to her,
she certainly makes the team click.

497
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:40,040
- Where's Diane?
- She's in the rain.

498
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:42,518
Diane!
Here!

499
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:44,350
You better get up
to the dean's office fast.

500
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:47,881
<i>- Your pop's trying to make Benson expel Molly.
- He can't force him to do that.</i>

501
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:52,225
Maybe not, but he says he'll withdraw his
financial support unless she gets thrown out.

502
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:55,130
Ohh.
What's the dean saying?

503
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:58,294
<i>When I left, he was still saying
no, but you better get up there.</i>

504
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:00,998
<i>If he cans Molly,
we got no basketball team.</i>

505
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,668
<i>And if he keeps her,
we got no school.</i>

506
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,803
I'm sorry, girls, we were trying to
get cleaned up before anybody came in.

507
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:09,574
Girl: That's all right, Slats,
go right ahead.

508
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,775
We're going to write
some jokes for the school play.

509
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:14,046
Jokes? I wish we had a couple
of jokes to give you.

510
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:15,746
What do you mean
you wish you had a couple?

511
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:16,913
I said...

512
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:18,546
- I got a joke.
- You've got a joke?

513
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:20,819
- A brand new one I wrote myself.
- Where did you get it?

514
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:21,950
I wrote it.
Aw, stop.

515
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,893
- Yes, I did, Slats. I did.
- You wrote a joke?

516
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:26,920
It's brand new. I'd like to tell
it to the girls. They'll like it.

517
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:28,693
- Is it brand new?
- Maybe they can use it.

518
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,031
- That's a good idea.
- The only thing is...

519
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,561
I tell this one by myself.
I don't need you.

520
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:37,073
That's all right.
But you say it's brand new?

521
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,575
- Yeah.
- Nobody's ever heard it?

522
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:41,544
No, and I tell the story
while you keep your mouth shut.

523
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,309
It's about a whale,
a ship, and Jonah.

524
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:46,976
- And it's brand new?
- Very brand new story, yeah.

525
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,713
Now once upon a time,
there was a whale.

526
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,017
- What kind a whale?
- And this whale was...

527
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:52,818
What kind of a whale?

528
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:55,553
- A plain everyday whale.
- A wh... all right, I'm sorry.

529
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,992
How do I know
what kind a whale?!

530
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:59,428
What do you think I do,
go around with whales or something?

531
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:02,627
- Don't try and make a fool out of me in front of the girls.
- Go ahead.

532
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:05,465
- A plain, everyday whale, that's all!
- So it was a whale.

533
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:07,471
- How do I know what kind of whale?
- All right.

534
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,803
- The whale was in the ocean, he was...
- What ocean?

535
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:14,443
- Wait a minute, I mean...
- Go on, pick out an ocean. Go ahead.

536
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:17,107
- That's immaterial to me.
- All right, The Immaterial Ocean.

537
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:18,615
Aw, come on.

538
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:21,015
The whale was in the ocean
and minding his own business.

539
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:22,849
- But he was followin' a ship.
- What ship?

540
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:24,878
- And this ship is...
- What ship?

541
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:28,824
- A ship that swims in the water.
- You mean a swim ship?

542
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,293
Yeah.
Oh.

543
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:32,728
The whale was followin'
the swim ship because he...

544
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:34,458
who ever heard of
a swim ship?

545
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:37,161
I asked you to keep
your mouth shut, didn't I?

546
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:39,829
- You're telling the story.
- You're getting me mad!

547
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:41,736
Wait a minute.
When do we laugh at this thing?

548
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:44,400
They're laughing before they're
supposed to. Don't laugh now.

549
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,876
- I didn't say nothin' yet.
- Go ahead, let's hear it.

550
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:49,709
The whale, she was hungry, and
Jonah was the captain of the boat.

551
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:51,681
He didn't want
the whale to capsize the boat.

552
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:53,013
- What?
- To capsize the boat.

553
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,109
- Capsize?
- Because, yeah, he didn't...

554
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,054
- You know what that means?
- I don't put words like that in stories

555
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:01,217
if I don't know what they are. He didn't
want the whale to capsize the boat.

556
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:03,193
- What does it mean?
- Capsize?

557
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,024
- Capsize.
- That's a big word.

558
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:07,257
Well, what does it mean?
You know what it means.

559
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,858
- Sure. That's a...
- What does it mean? What does capsize mean?

560
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,528
- It's a nice word.
- What does it mean?

561
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,196
Capsize?
Capsize.

562
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:16,729
- It's six and seven-eighths, seven
and a quarter... - All right, go ahead.

563
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:19,538
He didn't want the whale
to six and seven-eighths the boat...

564
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:20,805
- All right, go ahead.
- See?

565
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,939
Captain Jonah was captain, and he
was afraid of throwing passengers,

566
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,609
so he figured the only thing
he could do was throw over

567
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,551
the barrel of...
the whale a barrel of apples.

568
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:30,053
- What kind of apples?
- And...

569
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:32,487
- What kind of apples?
- Apples that grow on a tree.

570
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,754
- There's all kinds of apples...
Baldwin apples, there's... - Crab-apples!

571
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:39,058
- Tell the girls that. - So he threw
him over a barrel of crab-apples!

572
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:42,793
- Take it easy, take it easy.
- He's got me mad at you kids now.

573
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:45,597
After the whale ate, the whale
was still hungry and Jonah figured

574
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:48,002
he'd throw the whale over a stool.
What kind of a stool?

575
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,802
- Who said that?
- I did. In case you asked me.

576
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,637
He threw him over
a three-legged camp-stool.

577
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:54,304
The whale ate the apples
and the stool and was still hungry.

578
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:56,973
His appetite had not been appeased.
Don't ask me what that is.

579
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,606
- I don't know.
- I won't ask. Go ahead.

580
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:01,584
After the whale ate the apples and
stool, the whale was still hungry,

581
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,554
and Captain Jonah figured the only
way to save his passengers and boat

582
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,386
is to sacrifice himself.
And he did.

583
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:09,188
He threw a beautiful jackknife dive
into the mouth of the whale.

584
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,628
The whale ate Captain Jonah and the
apples and the stool and then swam away.

585
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:16,155
- Three years later they caught that very same whale...
- Listen, Oliver...

586
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,637
...they cut him open and what
do you think they found?

587
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:22,070
Oliver, wait a moment.

588
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:23,596
Not now. Not now.

589
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:26,701
He says something
and then I tell you the funny joke.

590
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,338
Wait a minute, Oliver,
just a minute.

591
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,577
You're not coming up here this
afternoon in front of these girls,

592
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:35,450
and try to give them
for their little play

593
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:39,388
a joke... an old wheeze... about
the time they caught the whale,

594
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,256
and they cut him open and there
they found Jonah seated on that stool

595
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,591
selling those apples
three for a nickel, are you?

596
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:46,096
Wait a minute.

597
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,064
That's not the story you...

598
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,865
no, no, no. No, I'm
sorry, it couldn't be that,

599
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:54,894
because, that's right, he promised
us it was a brand new joke.

600
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,907
He wrote it himself,
so it couldn't be that.

601
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,966
because every schoolboy
knows that joke.

602
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,171
I'm sorry, I interrupted.
Go ahead.

603
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:04,238
You tell the girls what they
found when they cut the whale open.

604
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,876
Now, wait a minute, please.

605
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:09,943
Give Oliver a chance...
after all, he wrote this himself.

606
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:12,979
If you girls can use it
in the play, go right ahead.

607
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,685
Go ahead.

608
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:18,957
Tell the girls what they found
when they cut the whale open.

609
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:21,089
Don't laugh, girls.
He'll blame me for this.

610
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,363
I thought it was
a build-up to that old joke,

611
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:27,496
but every little schoolboy knows
that. He wouldn't tell that.

612
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:31,201
He wouldn't dare tell that one. Go
ahead. You know the answer, don't you?

613
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:34,541
Huh?

614
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:37,342
What's the matter,
don't you feel good, hmm?

615
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:40,908
Well, you go ahead
and tell the joke

616
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:43,181
and then we'll go inside
and clean the other room.

617
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,279
Go ahead. No, no, here.

618
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,086
Tell it right here.

619
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:49,319
Oliver... look, Oliver...

620
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,296
hey, Oliver...
Oliver, is something wrong?

621
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,232
<i>- Now, come on, Oliver,
I didn't mean any harm.</i>

622
00:38:56,267 --> 00:39:00,761
Oliver! Was that the joke you
wanted to tell these girls, hmm?

623
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:04,107
Boys! Boys, here's
a note from Molly!

624
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:06,939
A note? What is this?

625
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:08,808
Hey, get a load of this...

626
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,440
"Dear Slats and Oliver,
am leaving Bixby.

627
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:14,747
If you're ready to leave too, meet
me at the front gate at 8:00 tonight.

628
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:17,185
- "Signed, Molly. "
- She can't leave.

629
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:20,816
Wait a minute, if she's leaving,
she must have a good reason.

630
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,758
And I'm going with her!

631
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,351
I'm going with you, too.

632
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:26,522
Oliver, aren't you
gonna kiss me goodbye?

633
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:28,464
Yes, Patty.

634
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:32,196
Patty, the time has come
to say goodbye.

635
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:39,667
Patty, the time has come
to say goodbye.

636
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:47,083
- Patty, the time has come...
- You just said that.

637
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:50,087
You shut up. Goodbye.

638
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,623
I feel just like Donald O'Connor!

639
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:58,753
Let's play house

640
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:01,788
Let's play mister
and missus

641
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:04,858
My main reason
for this is

642
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,632
There'll be chances
for plenty of kisses

643
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:10,538
Let's play house

644
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,304
Let's play games

645
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:16,006
I think that would
be chummy

646
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:19,345
Golf, or maybe gin rummy

647
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:22,409
Let's play bridge
and we'll both be the dummy

648
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:25,149
Let's play games

649
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:28,420
Let's quote
from Mother Goose

650
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:30,791
And we'll find
rhymes that fit

651
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:33,797
Like Mary had
a little lamb

652
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:36,322
And darling, you are it

653
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:39,734
Oh, let's play house

654
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,637
I'll bring flowers and "con-dy"

655
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:45,733
I think that would be "don-dy"

656
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,745
Guys like me
sure come in mighty "hon-dy"

657
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,907
Let's play house

658
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:59,948
Let's play show

659
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:03,153
Let's not act too suburban

660
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:06,163
I look well in a turban

661
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:09,633
- I'll be Boyer
- And I'll be Miss Durbin

662
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:13,398
Meet me by the gas pipe

663
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,972
Let's play school

664
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:21,273
Let's start out
with subtraction

665
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,803
You'll get
plenty of action

666
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:27,079
I think figures have
such an attraction

667
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:32,145
Let's play scho-ool

668
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:34,783
Folks in a storybook

669
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,487
Are just like you and me

670
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:40,588
So I'll be Red Riding Hood

671
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:43,191
And the wolf
is what I'll be

672
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:48,803
Well, let's pretend

673
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,808
Let's get
very light-hearted

674
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,777
Let's go
places uncharted

675
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:57,713
Let's go back
to the first thing we started

676
00:41:57,748 --> 00:42:04,119
Let's play house!

677
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:18,728
Whooo!

678
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,369
Whoo!

679
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:38,318
Slats?

680
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:39,982
No, it's Larry.
Oh.

681
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:41,651
You can't
run away like this, Molly.

682
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:43,284
- Why not?
- Because I won't let you.

683
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,988
- My mind's made up.
- I know.

684
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:47,862
Diane and Patty told me what you
must've overheard in the shower,

685
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,765
but I won't let you throw away your
scholarship because of Kirkland.

686
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:52,359
That has nothing
to do with it.

687
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,667
Well, hasn't Bixby come up
to your dreams?

688
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:56,832
Dreams?

689
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:58,842
You mean
that magazine article.

690
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:00,605
That was Slat's dream,
not mine.

691
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:02,771
He made up the whole thing
for a publicity story.

692
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:05,907
- You're joking.
- That's why I came here.

693
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,441
Slats said we could get
more pictures, more publicity.

694
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:11,010
Since we can't, well,
that's that.

695
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,148
I see.

696
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,919
No, I don't see.

697
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:17,257
Why, that doesn't fit at all
with your good grades

698
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:18,818
and your interest
in your work.

699
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:21,422
And it fits far too perfectly
with Kirkland's blow up.

700
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:24,764
Well, after I came, I did
sort of fall for the school.

701
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:26,702
Enough to walk out
to save it, hmm?

702
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:30,036
There's no sense staying if being
here means Kirkland'll close the place!

703
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:32,872
I thought that was it.
And that's just why you must stay.

704
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:36,004
Don't you understand? If you go,
Kirkland will think I've given in to him.

705
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:39,174
If he thinks I've given in once, he'll
expect me to give in all the time.

706
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:41,582
Everything I've planned
for the school will be banned.

707
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,678
I didn't see it that way.

708
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:45,586
Neither did I...

709
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:50,155
not until I realized
how much I'd miss you.

710
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:53,527
We'd better be getting back.

711
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:57,762
You could do all those things if it weren't
for Kirkland and his stuffy traditions?

712
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,632
I'd like to think that I could.

713
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,002
- We go this way, I believe.
- I go that way.

714
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:04,303
Unless you want Miss Holford
to catch you sneaking

715
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:06,070
a runaway girl into the dorm.

716
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,670
- You go that way.
- May I have my bags, Dean Benson?

717
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:11,078
It's Larry,
outside of office hours.

718
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:13,049
May I have them, Larry?

719
00:44:15,352 --> 00:44:17,411
- Goodnight, Molly.
- Goodnight.

720
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:24,091
She's very attractive,
isn't she?

721
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:26,722
I guess I inherited it
from father...

722
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:30,427
the habit of thinking that everything
would turn out exactly as I'd planned it.

723
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:33,027
- Diane...
- Don't say anything, Larry.

724
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:36,597
Remember, whatever happens,
I'm on your side.

725
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:42,103
Just 100 more students and their tuition
will make Larry independent of Kirkland.

726
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:44,671
That's where I come in. What
this school needs is publicity.

727
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:46,842
We've got to tell the world
how happy you are here.

728
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:48,909
That would make
every girl want to go to Bixby.

729
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:53,116
- But I promised...
- Wait, if we only had the pictures I took when you first arrived.

730
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:54,920
- I got 'em. Yeah.
- You've got 'em? Where?

731
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:56,323
Come here. Over here.

732
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,294
I took 'em
out of Johnson's room.

733
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:01,024
Oh boy, what a lucky guy
Benson was when he hired us.

734
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:02,965
I think we ought to talk
to Larry about this.

735
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,831
<i>Quick! Hide!</i>

736
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,733
<i>- Under the bed!
- No, here, in the closet!</i>

737
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,397
- In the closet. Quick!
- Hurry, get in.

738
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:10,703
Don't say a word.
I'll... wait a minute. Come here.

739
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:13,073
What're you doing in there?
Get out. Get out of there.

740
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,668
Go answer the door.

741
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,304
But the door
didn't say nothing.

742
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:18,507
- Go see who's at the door.
- Okay.

743
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,912
Where is she? Where's Molly?

744
00:45:25,956 --> 00:45:27,981
- Molly? I don't even know the girl.
- Here I am.

745
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:29,549
Huh!
Hm-hm-hm!

746
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:31,561
You're in a jam.
Miss Holford knows you're out

747
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:33,495
and Johnson's out snooping
around for you.

748
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:36,863
If you're caught here, the boys'll
be fired and you'll be expelled.

749
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:40,564
Johnson's on his way here!

750
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:42,128
Wait a minute.
Don't get excited.

751
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:44,003
Get her out the window,
I'll stall him off.

752
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:46,703
- Put that in your pocket.
- Okay.

753
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:49,042
No, not Oliver!

754
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,546
Help!
No!

755
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,981
Well, if she ain't in there,
why won't you let me in?

756
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:54,745
Everything's in a mess.

757
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:56,309
Oh, it is?
Yeah.

758
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:59,015
After me telling you guys
to keep everything clean?

759
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:02,184
We washed all the dishes and
we can't do a thing with them.

760
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:04,091
Wait a minute.
Take it easy, take it easy.

761
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:07,529
Boy, can you imagine Mr. Johnson if
he ever found a girl in this room?

762
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:09,828
- Yeah, well, I'm a girl.
- I know it.

763
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:11,892
- Out the window.
- Ohh!

764
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,801
- Hurry up!
- I can't, there's not time.

765
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:16,601
Under the bed!
Under the bed!

766
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,575
- Not you, me!
- Quick, duck.

767
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,805
I said I was coming in
and I'm coming in.

768
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:23,540
Mr. Johnson! Oh boy.

769
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,208
Ohh.
Fancy meeting you here.

770
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,775
Now, you see?
Miss McCarthy is not here.

771
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:31,754
- Is she, Oliver?
- Oh no, Miss McCarthy was never here.

772
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,586
- No.
- Get out of the way.

773
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:39,053
Maybe she ain't, but I've got
a hunch she's coming here.

774
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:41,291
Then why not stick around
and see?

775
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:43,128
<i>Why don't you sleep here
all night?</i>

776
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:45,158
- Oh, no, Slats!
- Hey, that's a good idea.

777
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:46,794
Sleep here all night,
if you wish.

778
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:48,634
I'll sleep in the living room
on the couch.

779
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:51,232
Slats, never mind, I'll sleep
out there. You sleep in here.

780
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:53,004
- Oh, no, no, no.
- I'm trying to tell you...

781
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:54,943
No, no, no. Oliver!

782
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:57,105
No, you see, he's afraid
to sleep by himself.

783
00:46:57,147 --> 00:47:00,275
Every night I have to look under the
beds to make sure there's no one there.

784
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,376
- I'll do that for you tonight.
- Wait a minute!

785
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:04,819
Left hand, please, left hand.
Give me your left hand.

786
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:06,220
What're you doing?

787
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:08,121
He loves to dance.
I meant to tell you.

788
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,785
I like to dance
before I go to bed.

789
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,988
All right, all right.
Go ahead, pack in, boys.

790
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:14,463
I'll sleep outside.
Pleasant dreams.

791
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,363
Okay.

792
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:21,763
<i>Johnson: Come on, it's
getting late. Get undressed.</i>

793
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:24,273
Oh no. Wait a minute.
What're you gonna do?

794
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:26,105
Put these under the bed.

795
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:28,907
Not under this bed.
Mr. Johnson, let me polish them.

796
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:31,915
I'll clean 'em. First thing in the
morning, I'll give you your shoes.

797
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:34,008
You don't want to go out
with dirty shoes, do you?

798
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:35,678
All right,
I'll take this bed.

799
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:38,552
No-oo, not this bed,
Mr. Johnson, please.

800
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:41,387
This one over here. Go ahead, Mr.
Johnson, it's a much better bed.

801
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:44,258
It's a very hard bed on this side.
This is a very good bed.

802
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:47,320
The mattress is wonderful.
It's down... the whole thing.

803
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,298
Down! Down! Down!

804
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,824
Down! Do-oown!

805
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:56,105
Mr. Johnson,
I made a mistake.

806
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:58,403
Will you please take
the other bed?

807
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:00,034
Why?!

808
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:03,342
I think you'll sleep better.
Please take the other bed.

809
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,348
They both look alike to me.

810
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:07,043
I know, but it's
a much better bed.

811
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:08,984
I know you're gonna
love this here one.

812
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,954
Whoo!

813
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:16,619
Mr. Johnson, Mr. Johnson!

814
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,628
Not this bed.

815
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:21,358
I think that my first choice
was the best one.

816
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:27,226
Why don't you make up
your mind?!

817
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:30,000
Don't forget it!

818
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,204
Make up your mind, you!

819
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,474
I'm gonna go to sleep with you,
Mr. Johnson,

820
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:38,640
and I'll put on
my pajamas.

821
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,918
Thank you.

822
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:50,889
<i>- Hey!
- Get your head in there!</i>

823
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,690
Hey, you, get out!
Get out!

824
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:57,632
- What's the matter?
- I'm gotta get you out.

825
00:48:57,668 --> 00:48:59,602
Get... get out!
Help!

826
00:48:59,636 --> 00:49:02,400
Get out! Hurry up!
Get out!

827
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:07,976
Out! Out!

828
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:10,673
Out! Get your...

829
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:12,375
Hey, what's
this "out" business?

830
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:15,044
I was trying
to get your head out.

831
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:16,609
It was hurting.

832
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:19,679
I'll never get any rest in...

833
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:22,521
What happened to my shoes?

834
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,686
What did you do
with my shoes?!

835
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:27,253
I want my shoes!

836
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:32,595
I want my hat.
I mean, good night.

837
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:45,746
<i>- Get a load of Kirkland. Why, the old wolf!
- Open it up, Patty.</i>

838
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:47,306
- Yeah, let's see the rest.
- Okay.

839
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:28,250
Oh, stash it.
Here comes Romeo.

840
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:35,060
Get Diane and Molly and bring
them to the furnace room, will ya?

841
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:36,258
Yeah.

842
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:39,268
Oh, Mr. Kirkland,
swell publicity.

843
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:41,065
And a nice picture of you.

844
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:43,265
You mind your own
business, will you?

845
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:47,700
- Oliver, the furnace room, quick!
- Okay.

846
00:50:52,015 --> 00:50:54,711
- Oliver, hurry up!
- All right!

847
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:57,481
- Gee, gimme a chance.
- Yeah, give him a chance.

848
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:59,648
- I just said that.
- Oh, that's where I heard it.

849
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:02,487
How are we gonna find out what's
going on in the dean's office?

850
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:04,721
- That's as simple as A, B... what comes after B?
- C.

851
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:08,060
See? I tell you what you do.
Come here.

852
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,800
Now, look, this is my secret.
Don't tell anybody, nobody at all.

853
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:16,431
All I got to do is turn this on.

854
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:18,907
Follow me. Come here.

855
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:25,576
<i>Kirkland: And not only does this
magazine cover make a fool out of me,</i>

856
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:27,549
<i>but it's a disgrace
to all Bixby.</i>

857
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:28,642
The dean's office.

858
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:32,644
<i>Benson: On the contrary, I think it makes
you and the school appear refreshingly human.</i>

859
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:34,088
Attaboy, Larry.

860
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:37,821
And this scandalous notoriety
was prepared with your approval?

861
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:41,797
Certainly not. But I do think it's
going to prove a real help to the school.

862
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:45,165
I'll tell you what's going to
prove a real help to the school...

863
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:48,797
now, today...
the expulsion of Miss McCarthy,

864
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:51,103
<i>and your resignation as dean.</i>

865
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:54,109
<i>You forget that my contract runs
till the end of the school term.</i>

866
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:56,578
You mean you intend to hold
the regents to that contract?

867
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,604
For the good
of the school, yes.

868
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:02,243
Very well, young man, you'll be
a dean without a school.

869
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:05,743
I will demand the delinquent
mortgage payments immediately.

870
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,087
By the end of the week,
I'll close the whole school up.

871
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,151
And I'll keep it closed
until your contract expires.

872
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:12,923
- You wouldn't dare!
- Oh, wouldn't I?!

873
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,158
You just wait
till Monday and see.

874
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:20,160
Isn't there any way out?

875
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:22,797
Not unless we can raise enough
money to pay that mortgage.

876
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:25,205
Is there $20,000
in the house?

877
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:27,938
- We could take up a collection.
- I have $1.80 in my piggy bank.

878
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,412
- I know the kids'll chip in.
- I'll tell you what we can do...

879
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:33,041
if we can raise a lot of money,
we could bet on a horse race.

880
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:36,746
Yeah, all we need is a sure-fire
horse, guaranteed to pay 100-to-1.

881
00:52:36,786 --> 00:52:39,448
I know a basketball
game that'll pay 20-to-1.

882
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:41,684
- Our team against Carlton?
- Mm-hmm.

883
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:44,285
At 20-to-1, we'll only have
to raise $1,000.

884
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:47,490
- $1,000? That's a lot of money.
- You can say that again.

885
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:50,056
Okay.
$1,000 is a lot of money.

886
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:56,405
This ought to bring in enough
money to bet on the basketball game.

887
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:58,236
I hope so.

888
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:14,679
All: I don't care if I never dream again

889
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:23,754
Woman:
One look at you

890
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:30,289
And all my dreams
came true

891
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:41,901
All: I don't care if I never love again

892
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:49,140
How could there be

893
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:57,685
A greater love for me?

894
00:54:57,727 --> 00:55:01,094
All:
There was a time...

895
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:05,261
Woman:
I used to lie on my pillow

896
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:09,864
All:
Drifting along on a star

897
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:12,534
But now I find

898
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:16,807
Woman:
I don't rely on my pillow

899
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:23,775
All: I'm on a star when I'm where you are

900
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:34,459
I don't care
if I never dream again

901
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:43,763
Since I found you

902
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:49,643
There's
no more dreamin' to do

903
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:56,050
All: There's no more dreamin' to do

904
00:55:56,086 --> 00:56:03,017
Oh-ahh...

905
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:07,928
Oh-ahh!

906
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,739
It's good for you.

907
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:19,935
What is this?
Oyster stew.

908
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:21,910
- Any oysters in it?
- Certainly not.

909
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:24,038
Whoever heard of an
oyster stew with an oyster?

910
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,048
- I'm afraid of oysters.
- Go ahead and eat it.

911
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:27,879
Not with a fork... spoon.

912
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:14,224
What are you doing?

913
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,391
I think there's
a wild oyster in there.

914
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,492
- What are you talking about?
- There is, Slats.

915
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:21,163
Oh, stop. Look at that.
There's no oysters in there.

916
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:24,401
Go ahead and eat your stew and behave
yourself. I'm reading the paper.

917
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,965
Okay.

918
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:38,686
What are you doing
over there?

919
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,628
What's the matter with you?

920
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:51,429
Shh, quiet.

921
00:57:57,006 --> 00:57:59,065
Would you stop splashing?

922
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:41,846
What are you doing?

923
00:58:58,334 --> 00:59:01,235
Oh, wipe yourself off.

924
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:03,535
Here they are.
Hello, Oliver.

925
00:59:03,573 --> 00:59:06,440
- How much money did you get?
- $504.82.

926
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:08,910
Isn't there anyone who'll bet
40-to-1 on Carlton?

927
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:12,039
- 20-to-1 is the best we can get.
- We've got to promote another 500.

928
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:13,605
Yes.
Here.

929
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:16,346
Hear what I have to say.
I mean...

930
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,786
Hey, wait a minute. I've
got an idea. Don't go away.

931
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:22,120
McGurk!
Hiya, Slats!

932
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:23,853
Well, you're good
for sore eyes.

933
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,521
Say, are you still wrestling
for those big purses, tiger?

934
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:29,054
Nah, not me.
I'm workin' for Murphy now.

935
00:59:29,098 --> 00:59:30,759
<i>That's me,
the Masked Marvel.</i>

936
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:35,729
I'm making enough dough
to buy me banana fudge sundaes.

937
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:37,137
Is that you?

938
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:38,800
Hey, wait a minute.

939
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:40,866
How would you like
to make $500?

940
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,639
- 500 bucks?
- Now, don't get excited.

941
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:44,510
What do I have to do?

942
00:59:44,547 --> 00:59:46,947
I am not gonna wrestle
that big guy.

943
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:48,575
<i>- Yes, you will.
- No, I won't!</i>

944
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:50,518
<i>- Yes, you will!
- No, I won't!</i>

945
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:52,919
- I said you would.
- I won't.

946
00:59:52,956 --> 00:59:54,787
You're a coward.

947
00:59:54,824 --> 00:59:56,553
All right,
but I'm a live coward.

948
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,458
- Come on, let's get...
- Where's Honest Dan?

949
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:01,793
- He's not in here?
- Say what're you two doing in here anyhow?

950
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:05,460
Doing? Oliver here is going
to wrestle the Masked Marvel.

951
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:09,665
- Oliver you're going to...
- Get up!

952
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:13,073
- You want to ruin your hat?
- I'm gonna make a bet on this.

953
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:15,407
Hey, did you hear that?

954
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,675
Shut up!

955
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:20,182
I told you to stay away
from those soda fountains.

956
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:23,583
- Hiya, Dan.
- Strangler Johnson, am I glad to see you!

957
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,884
- Are you still in good shape?
- Sure, why?

958
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:28,390
I'll give you $50 if you'll
be the Masked Marvel tonight.

959
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:31,825
- What's the matter with him?
- He ate too many banana fudge sundaes.

960
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:35,920
You mean I'd get to wrestle
that little guy across the hall?

961
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:38,957
Yeah.
Give me that mask.

962
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:42,165
- I'm not gonna wrestle the Masked Marvel!
- Why not?

963
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:44,196
I'm scared!
Why?

964
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,003
He's as big as a bull.

965
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:48,010
Well then,
wrestle him like a bull.

966
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:51,411
Look, just walk into that arena
like a matador,

967
01:00:51,447 --> 01:00:53,938
jump into the ring
like a toreador,

968
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:56,247
and wrestle him
like a picador.

969
01:00:56,285 --> 01:00:58,776
And they'll carry me out
like a cuspidor.

970
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:00,288
Come on, get this off...

971
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:03,520
I am telling you, Slats,
I am not going to wrestle him.

972
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:05,390
He's too big!

973
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:06,918
<i>- I won't.
- You will.</i>

974
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:08,294
<i>- I won't!
- You will.</i>

975
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,196
I won't... he's too big!

976
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:12,565
I don't care how big he is.
He don't scare me.

977
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:14,433
- Man: Excuse me.
- You know...

978
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:19,841
Oliver! Oliver! My hero!

979
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:24,441
Here's a rabbit's foot
for luck.

980
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,778
The rabbit had four of 'em...
it didn't do him any good.

981
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:28,943
Ha! Don't worry,
I'm right behind you.

982
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:30,714
Feel that.

983
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:32,948
Yeah, feel that.

984
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:34,581
That's enough, let go.

985
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:38,617
- What's the matter?
- Let go, you're squeezin' too tight!

986
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:41,892
Well, good luck! Ooh.

987
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:48,602
Oh, come on, get in the
ring, get in the ring.

988
01:01:48,638 --> 01:01:49,764
All right, all right.

989
01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:55,172
- See that?
- Don't worry about a thing.

990
01:01:57,413 --> 01:01:59,381
What are you doing?

991
01:01:59,415 --> 01:02:01,940
Get over here.
Come over here and sit down.

992
01:02:01,984 --> 01:02:04,452
Come over here
and sit down.

993
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:07,081
Now get with it.
Go ahead.

994
01:02:08,658 --> 01:02:10,751
What are you doing
down there?

995
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:13,626
Ladies and gentlemen,

996
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:16,461
<i>presenting the Bixby Bulldog,</i>

997
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:18,558
<i>Oliver Quakenbush!</i>

998
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:24,168
- I don't want to wrestle.
- Quiet, everything's all right.

999
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:27,608
<i>Announcer: And now,
the champion of all champions,</i>

1000
01:02:27,643 --> 01:02:30,203

1003
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:41,453
Come here, come here,

1004
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:43,982
- Did you see what he did?
- It's all right. All right.

1005
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:46,927
Take it easy, take it easy.
Listen, everything is fixed.

1006
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:50,558
Don't worry about a thing.
You are going to win this match.

1007
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,261
What do you mean,
everything's fixed?

1008
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:54,462
Shh. It's all in the bag.
I've arranged for everything.

1009
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:56,768
Why do you wait
until now to tell me?

1010
01:02:56,806 --> 01:03:00,207
Because you've got too big a mouth.
You'd went and splattered it all over.

1011
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:03,440
Now listen, we've got to win
this $1,000 for the school.

1012
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:06,039
We've got to have it. It's up
to you to get in there and do it.

1013
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:08,016
It's all fixed,
he won't harm you in the least.

1014
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:09,813
- Is that masked guy in on it?
- Sure he is.

1015
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:11,820
- He knows it's all fixed?
- Certainly he does.

1016
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:14,789
- And this match is gonna help Patty?
- Why, it'll save the school.

1017
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:18,590
- Get your hands off me. You're talkin' to a wrestler.
- Attaboy, now you're talkin'.

1018
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:20,152
- Easy! Take it easy.
- For Bixby!

1019
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:22,687
That's it, for Bixb... oooh!
For Bixby.

1020
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:24,597
- Take it easy.
- All right, take it easy.

1021
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:27,228
Attaboy, go out there
and give it to him.

1022
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:28,760
- Come on.
- Take the coat.

1023
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,740
- All right. Go ahead.
- For Bixby.

1024
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:33,571
Throw out your chest,
throw out your chest.

1025
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:35,873
- How far?
- All right, throw it out.

1026
01:03:35,912 --> 01:03:39,006
- I'm not through with it yet.
- Throw it... all right, go ahead.

1027
01:03:39,048 --> 01:03:42,279
- Attaboy. Look at that.
- Don't bruise me.

1028
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:44,115
<i>Announcer:
Come on, let's go.</i>

1029
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:46,212
- Gentlemen...
- Yes, sir.

1030
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:48,280
...this is going to be
a clean wrestling match.

1031
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:51,293
- You can't hit
in the stomach like this.

1032
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:55,764
- You can't gouge the eyes like this.
- Oh no, no... cut it out!

1033
01:03:55,798 --> 01:03:58,198
And you can't use
the elbow like this!

1034
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:02,001
So get to your corner
and come out wrestling.

1035
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:16,746
Slats! Slats!

1036
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:18,447
Slats!

1037
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:23,820
- Oliver, are you hurt?
- Don't worry, it's all fixed.

1038
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,828
Where's Sla-aats?!

1039
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:48,076
Oliver, now you've got him!

1040
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,854
You would've had him.

1041
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:59,225
Hello?
Oliver, It's for you.

1042
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:01,958
- Tell 'em I'm all tied up!
- All right.

1043
01:05:09,772 --> 01:05:11,535
You win.

1044
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:39,101
I'll disqualify you if you don't
keep your head out of the ropes.

1045
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:54,239
You're on top now, Oliver.

1046
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:15,501
Oliver, play fair!

1047
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:23,939
Thanks very much.

1048
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:35,654
Hello, Mr. Johnson.

1049
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:54,869
Oliver,
get up off that floor!

1050
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:57,174
Oliver, now get up
off the floor.

1051
01:06:57,213 --> 01:07:00,148
Listen, now don't be...

1052
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,553
Boy, am I in a mess.

1053
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:11,259
Now you've got him, Oliver.

1054
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:21,927
Floor him, Oliver!

1055
01:07:27,176 --> 01:07:29,804
The winner!

1056
01:07:29,845 --> 01:07:31,745
Oh! Ollie!

1057
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:55,702
So you're permitting
competitive athletics?

1058
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:58,172
- Another violation of tradition.
- That's right.

1059
01:07:58,207 --> 01:08:01,438
Final gesture of defiance
before I close the school, huh?

1060
01:08:01,477 --> 01:08:03,502
I don't think you'll
close the school, Dad,

1061
01:08:03,546 --> 01:08:05,707
thanks to those girls
and the caretakers.

1062
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,740
- What's that?
- There's one thing you've accomplished, Mr. Kirkland.

1063
01:08:08,784 --> 01:08:13,153
Your attitude has given Bixby more
real spirit than it's ever had before.

1064
01:08:13,189 --> 01:08:16,556
Hooray for our side

1065
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:20,153
Sure as shootin' we are
rootin' for the right side

1066
01:08:20,196 --> 01:08:21,891
You know
we never give up

1067
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:23,660
You know we never
give in

1068
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:27,100
And if we lose instead of win,
we'll still be wearin' a grin

1069
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:30,367
Hooray for our side

1070
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:33,807
We'll be fightin', fightin',
fightin' all the way

1071
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:37,279
Let the foe be strong,
let the foe be tall

1072
01:08:37,313 --> 01:08:39,281
Just don't forget
the bigger they come

1073
01:08:39,315 --> 01:08:40,942
Kaboom!
The harder they fall

1074
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:44,146
Our team is our pride

1075
01:08:44,186 --> 01:08:46,381
So a-rickety-rixby,
here's to Bixby

1076
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:48,151
Hullaba, hullaba, yay!

1077
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:54,754
For our side hooray!

1078
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:01,565
- You want to bet money on Bixby?
- Yeah, what odds?

1079
01:09:01,604 --> 01:09:05,199
Against Bixby, 20-to-1, on anything
from backgammon to baseball.

1080
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:07,266
20-to-1?

1081
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:12,144
I got $1,000 I want to bet on Bixby
to beat Carlton in the basketball game.

1082
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:14,581
- $1,000? That's a
lot of money. - Mm-hmm.

1083
01:09:14,617 --> 01:09:16,448
Go on, Dan, take it.

1084
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:18,885
Okay, it's a bet, 20-to-1.

1085
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:20,946
- He accepted it.
- So what?

1086
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,823
- Now, I got to bet.
- That's what we want.

1087
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:26,419
Look you, you have the money
over at the game,

1088
01:09:26,462 --> 01:09:29,727
because as soon as it's finished,
the big payoff must come.

1089
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:31,892
I'll be there.

1090
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:34,562
What was that?
Nuts.

1091
01:09:36,205 --> 01:09:38,036
Hm-hm-hm!
All right!

1092
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:39,938
Hm-hm-hm... hm!

1093
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:41,806
Here, here, here,
come on.

1094
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:45,303
That's makin'
an easy $1,000.

1095
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:47,406
There's something
you don't know.

1096
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:49,110
Bixby has
a pretty good team.

1097
01:09:49,151 --> 01:09:51,085
Why did you talk me
into covering a grand?

1098
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,951
There's something else
you don't know.

1099
01:09:52,988 --> 01:09:56,185
That Carlton coach and me
are just like that.

1100
01:09:57,526 --> 01:09:59,585
And I'm going over
to Carlton...

1101
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:02,995
<i>Hooray for our side</i>

1102
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:06,092
Sure as shootin' we are
rootin' for the right side

1103
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:07,966
You know we never give up

01:10:08,003 --> 01:10:09,971
You know we never give in

1105
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:12,940
And if we lose instead of win,
we'll still be wearin a grin

1106
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:15,443
Hooray for our side...

1107
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:17,172
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

1108
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:19,681
This is Bill Stern
speaking from Carlton College.

1109
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:22,183
And now we bring you today's
longshot sports event...

1110
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:25,187
the unknown, unheralded,
girls basketball team from Bixby,

1111
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:29,214
as they attempt to upset the undefeated
conference champions from Carton!

1112
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:31,852
While the teams are
taking their last warm-up shots,

1113
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:34,829
<i>I think it's about time for me
to run down the starting line-up.</i>

1114
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:37,855
<i>For Bixby, at right forward,
Molly McCarthy.</i>

1115
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,993
<i>At left forward,
Hortense Harris.</i>

1116
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:41,832
<i>At center...</i>

1117
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:12,734
- She's great. You know, Patty...
- Huh?

1118
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:14,531
she's almost as good
as Daisy Dimple,

1119
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:18,006
the world's champion girl
basketball player... almost as good.

1120
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:27,677
- We're gonna beat you! We're gonna beat...
- Shh! Quiet.

1121
01:11:27,716 --> 01:11:31,152
That's the third basket in a row
for this fast-breaking Bixby team.

1122
01:11:31,186 --> 01:11:33,017
Bixby... six,
Carlton... nothing.

1123
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:34,955
You said they'd be here
before the game.

1124
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:37,390
That's what they told me.

1125
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:47,031
What's the meaning of this?

1126
01:11:47,069 --> 01:11:50,095
Excuse us, grandpa, but we've
got to get to Carlton College quick.

1127
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:52,505
- You going that way?
- As a matter of fact, I am.

1128
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:54,736
- We're going with you.
- Oh, you're going with me.

1129
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:57,439
Nice. All right.

1130
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,730
<i>Stern: And the half ends
with the amazing Bixby team</i>

1131
01:12:23,772 --> 01:12:26,104
leading by as score of 20-16.

1132
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:29,372
Across the floor, where the Bixby
stands are really jumping,

1133
01:12:29,411 --> 01:12:31,038
their band and glee club
are preparing

1134
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:33,014
some between-the-halves
entertainment.

1135
01:12:33,048 --> 01:12:34,276
Let's switch down
to our floor microphone.

1136
01:12:39,555 --> 01:12:42,251
<i>Patty: Boy, boy, boy, if you know the score</i>

1137
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:44,452
<i>Hoy, hoy, hoy,
whatcha waitin' for?</i>

1138
01:12:44,493 --> 01:12:48,657
Joy, joy, joy,
gave a how do you do

1139
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:51,427
Now that Friday's gone,
it's 10-to-1

1140
01:12:51,467 --> 01:12:54,231
There's a lot of fun
in sight

1141
01:12:54,269 --> 01:12:57,761
Jumpin' on Saturday night

1142
01:12:57,806 --> 01:13:01,503
- We're behind you
- Hi, hi, hi, Mr. Boogie man

1143
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:04,011
Try, try, try,
jivin' if you can

1144
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:08,073
My, my, my,
what's the matter with you?

1145
01:13:08,117 --> 01:13:10,745
If you're in a fix
and want some kicks

1146
01:13:10,786 --> 01:13:13,277
You'll be higher
than a kite

1147
01:13:13,322 --> 01:13:16,758
Jumpin' on Saturday night

1148
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:20,785
We'll make
a gay heyday of it

1149
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:23,161
That's the way of it

1150
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:27,032
Blue days are taboo

1151
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:30,300
We'll make a right,
bright night of it

1152
01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:32,637
Don't lose sight of it

1153
01:13:32,674 --> 01:13:36,132
There's plenty to do

1154
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:37,645
All:
Are you ready?

1155
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:39,943
Boy, boy, boy,
don't you want to shout?

1156
01:13:39,982 --> 01:13:42,416
Hoy, hoy, hoy, how you
makin' out?

1157
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:46,683
Joy, joy, joy,
knows a lot about you

1158
01:13:46,722 --> 01:13:49,282
When you hit the track,
you're jumpin' jack

1159
01:13:49,324 --> 01:13:52,122
Just be careful
where you light

1160
01:13:52,161 --> 01:13:55,426
Jumpin' on Saturday night!

1161
01:15:16,478 --> 01:15:18,275
All: B!

1162
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:21,444
I!

1163
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:24,179
X!

1164
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:26,187
B!

1165
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:27,518
Y!

1166
01:15:28,757 --> 01:15:31,021
B-I-X-B-Y!

1167
01:15:31,059 --> 01:15:32,856
Bi-iixby!

1168
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:47,236
Crowd:
Bixby! Bixby! Hooray!

1169
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:55,177
Here you are, my dear.

1170
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:58,584
- Sit right here, Dad, I've saved the best seat for you.
- Thanks.

1171
01:16:22,644 --> 01:16:24,043
Hey!

1172
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:28,106
- Look at those big amazings.
- Amazons.

1173
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:31,176
They dwarf the other girls. There's
not one of them less than 6 feet tall!

1174
01:16:31,219 --> 01:16:33,346
They're giants, or maybe
I ought to say giantesses.

1175
01:16:33,388 --> 01:16:35,515
Remember, we'll get
that McCarthy girl first.

1176
01:16:35,557 --> 01:16:37,582
<i>She's number three.</i>

1177
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:51,664
- Are you all right, Molly?
- Are you all right, Molly?

1178
01:16:51,707 --> 01:16:53,607
- I'm okay.
- Take care of her, Oliver.

1179
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:56,076
Our best player. Okay.

1180
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:57,635
I'll take care of her.

1181
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:59,943
Molly McCarthy's leaving
the floor limping badly.

1182
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:01,813
Oh, that's a terrible break
for Bixby.

1183
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:03,977
Molly's been the sparkplug
of their team.

1184
01:17:04,019 --> 01:17:06,715
<i>The horn blows
and the game goes on.</i>

1185
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:15,629
Anymore of that rough stuff,
I'll forfeit the game to Bixby.

1186
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:35,480
<i>Stern: Now, the referee
is knocked out cold.</i>

1187
01:17:35,517 --> 01:17:37,815
<i>That last basket counts.</i>

1188
01:17:37,853 --> 01:17:39,946
Carlton's now in the lead,
22-20.

1189
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:41,649
They're carrying
the referee out,

1190
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:45,126
and Lucille Walters, the Bixby
center who was hurt on that same play.

1191
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:48,789
This surprise Carlton team
is big and rough... very rough!

1192
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:51,355
There're no substitutes left
on the Bixby bench

1193
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,095
and no referee!

1194
01:17:53,135 --> 01:17:54,625
I wonder what Bixby will do now.

1195
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:57,366
The coaches are talking it over
in front of the Bixby bench.

1196
01:17:57,406 --> 01:17:59,499
Anybody you want
is okay with me.

1197
01:18:02,144 --> 01:18:04,203
Slats, go in and referee
the rest of the game.

1198
01:18:04,246 --> 01:18:05,975
But we have
no more substitutes.

1199
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:08,380
Oh yes we have... me.

1200
01:18:08,417 --> 01:18:11,784
- Can you dribble?
- No, but I can drool a little.

1201
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:28,092
<i>Oo-oh!</i>

1202
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,925
- Don't run with it, give it to somebody.
- Here!

1203
01:18:55,964 --> 01:18:57,727
- I don't want it!
- I don't want it either.

1204
01:18:57,766 --> 01:19:00,166
This game is for big girls,
not for little girls like me!

1205
01:19:00,202 --> 01:19:01,726
<i>Right here! Attababy!</i>

1206
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:05,171
I got it. I got it.

1207
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:07,437
Come on, Mable, attagirl!

1208
01:19:13,982 --> 01:19:17,110
Those last eight points
were practically given to Carlton

1209
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:19,313
by Bixby's substitute center,

1210
01:19:19,354 --> 01:19:23,552
who is probably the worst
basketball player I've ever seen.

1211
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:27,652
- What do I do with it?
- Throw it away.

1212
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:30,426
<i>Okay.</i>

1213
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,167
Oliver, you threw it
in the wrong basket.

1214
01:19:41,977 --> 01:19:45,310
<i>Oh, Oliver! Oliver!</i>

1215
01:19:45,347 --> 01:19:46,974
Oliver, are you all right?

1216
01:19:47,015 --> 01:19:49,643
Oh, my head.

1217
01:19:49,684 --> 01:19:51,618
Who are you?

1218
01:19:51,653 --> 01:19:54,213
- Why, I'm Patty.
- Pleased to meet you.

1219
01:19:54,256 --> 01:19:56,383
- Who are you?
- I'm Slats.

1220
01:19:56,424 --> 01:19:59,257
Never saw you before in my life.
My head, my head!

1221
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:01,159
That bump must have
knocked him wacky.

1222
01:20:03,598 --> 01:20:06,499
- Who am I?
- You're O...

1223
01:20:06,535 --> 01:20:10,631
You're Daisy Dimple, the greatest
girl basketball player in the world.

1224
01:20:10,672 --> 01:20:12,367
I am?
Yeah.

1225
01:20:12,407 --> 01:20:15,274
Then on with the game.
On with the game!

1226
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:18,905
- Let's go.
- Positions, girls, positions!

1227
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:09,897
It's in! It's in!

1228
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:13,992
This amazing girl has just made the
score 28 for Bixby to Carlton's 30!

1229
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:17,232
The game's nearly over.
Another basket'll tie the score.

1230
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:32,243
And Bixby ties the score
at 30 to 30.

1231
01:21:32,287 --> 01:21:34,619
There are only seconds
left to play.

1232
01:21:34,656 --> 01:21:36,487
That substitute center's
unbelievable,

1233
01:21:36,524 --> 01:21:39,755
incredible, impossible!
She's a one-girl tornado.

1234
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:42,820
Come on, out of that.
Come on, get up!

1235
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:47,526
Up. There we are.

1236
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:53,700
Hello, Patty.
Hello, Slats.

1237
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:55,801
- Hello, Daisy.
- Daisy, my name is Oliver.

1238
01:21:55,844 --> 01:21:58,870
- No, no, your name's Daisy.
- I'm a boy!

1239
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:01,439
My name never was Daisy.

1240
01:22:01,483 --> 01:22:03,610
Well, it is now.

1241
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:05,950
Oh, did I hurt you, Oliver?

1242
01:22:05,987 --> 01:22:09,218
Who are you callin' Oliver?
My name is Daisy.

1243
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:12,818
Please.
Positions, girls, positions!

1244
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:16,387
Everybody, positions!

1245
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:19,491
Hm, Oliver.
Never heard of the boy.

1246
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:32,944
My head! Whoo!
What do I do?

1247
01:22:32,981 --> 01:22:35,449
Hey! throw it to me, Oliver!

1248
01:22:35,483 --> 01:22:38,145
Me, Oliver! Throw it!

1249
01:22:47,395 --> 01:22:50,887
And Carlton wins 32-30.

1250
01:22:50,932 --> 01:22:54,698
I won't tell you how,
you'd never believe me.

1251
01:23:42,283 --> 01:23:45,775
Lois, Louise... I mean,
I didn't mean to lose the game,

1252
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:48,584
because I did my best.

1253
01:23:48,623 --> 01:23:50,716
Patty...

1254
01:23:50,759 --> 01:23:53,853
I tried hard.

1255
01:23:53,895 --> 01:23:56,557
Slats, I didn't mean
to lose the game.

1256
01:23:56,598 --> 01:23:58,429
I...

1257
01:24:02,404 --> 01:24:05,896
Everybody thinks
I wanted to lose the game.

1258
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:09,103
<i>Dan: Paying off is a pleasure
when you saved me all this dough.</i>

1259
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:16,441
<i>The little guy thought
he was going to be a hero.</i>

1260
01:24:16,484 --> 01:24:18,679
<i>Johnson: I told you
everything was in the bag.</i>

1261
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,950
Well, here's the payoff.

1262
01:24:24,592 --> 01:24:26,958
- Slats!
- Where'd you get that money?

1263
01:24:26,995 --> 01:24:30,260
I stole the money and I'm gonna wind up
in jail, but at least I'll save Bixby.

1264
01:24:30,298 --> 01:24:31,959
Come on! Come on!

1265
01:24:52,854 --> 01:24:55,618
Step on it, grandpa,
those guys have our dough.

1266
01:24:55,657 --> 01:24:57,215
Man:
Say, what am I, a taxi?

1267
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:01,455
Look at the big fish hook.

1268
01:25:01,496 --> 01:25:04,693
Fish hook? That's the
anchor. That goes overboard.

1269
01:25:10,004 --> 01:25:14,134
- Get up.
- Oliver: What stopped the boat?

1270
01:25:14,175 --> 01:25:17,110
Now look what you've done...
headin' us right back into trouble.

1271
01:25:17,145 --> 01:25:20,012
Come on, help me raise this
sail. Come on, come on, come on!

1272
01:25:20,048 --> 01:25:23,211
Never mind. Sail the boat.
Come on, lift it up. Hurry up.

1273
01:25:29,657 --> 01:25:31,386
What are you pushing me
out here for?

1274
01:25:31,426 --> 01:25:33,485
There's more room over there.

1275
01:25:33,528 --> 01:25:36,361
What are you trying to do?
Break that boom? Come on in here.

1276
01:25:36,397 --> 01:25:38,661
Out of the way!
Get out!

1277
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:40,600
Will you watch out?

1278
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:45,198
Look out!
Look out! Slats!

1279
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:47,731
Silly drivers!

1280
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:50,072
Out of the way!

1281
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:04,115
Slats, pull me in!

1282
01:26:15,537 --> 01:26:17,664
Johnson:
Hey, watch where you're going!

1283
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:37,819
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1284
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:40,350
Get it out!
Oh! Oh!

1285
01:26:40,395 --> 01:26:42,659
That hurts! Whoo!

1286
01:26:54,309 --> 01:26:57,710
Stay on the road! Keep it on
the road! Keep it on the road!

1287
01:27:14,596 --> 01:27:16,689
What's the matter?
Get 'em off, get 'em off.

1288
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:18,358
What's wrong with you?
After all...

1289
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:19,627
What's the matter with you?

1290
01:27:58,239 --> 01:28:00,002
Just a little more, Slats.

1291
01:28:10,918 --> 01:28:13,648
Come on, Slats.
Well, we saved the school.

1292
01:28:13,688 --> 01:28:16,987
- There's your money, Dan.
- That's not your money. That belongs to the boys.

1293
01:28:17,025 --> 01:28:18,856
- But Carlton won.
- Oh no, they didn't.

1294
01:28:18,893 --> 01:28:21,691
They had a professional team
playing for them... the Amazons.

1295
01:28:21,729 --> 01:28:24,061
Well, he played for Bixby,
and he's a ringer.

1296
01:28:24,098 --> 01:28:26,726
Five ringers to one,
the game is forfeited to Bixby.

1297
01:28:26,768 --> 01:28:28,565
You heard that...
five ringers to one.

1298
01:28:28,603 --> 01:28:31,128
- Hey, that's my dough!
- Ahh!

1299
01:28:31,172 --> 01:28:33,037
<i>Woman:
Where's our dough?</i>

1300
01:28:35,176 --> 01:28:36,473
Here's your money, Oliver.

1301
01:28:36,511 --> 01:28:38,775
- Here's the money, Slats.
- Here's the money, Dean.

1302
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:40,610
Here's the money,
Mr. Kirkland.

1303
01:28:40,648 --> 01:28:42,582
Well, right back
from where we started.

1304
01:28:44,252 --> 01:28:45,879
Rickety-rixby,
here's to Bixby

1305
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:46,978
Hullaba, hullaba, yay

1306
01:28:47,021 --> 01:28:49,922
For our side

1307
01:28:49,957 --> 01:28:54,917
Hooray!

1308
01:28:56,464 --> 01:28:58,523
Hooray, hooray!
Hooray for Kirkland!

1309
01:28:58,566 --> 01:29:00,295
Hooray
for Kirkland!

1310
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:02,326
You shouldn't be
cheering for me.

1311

1312
01:29:05,573 --> 01:29:08,770
what real school spirit means...

1313

And may I add,
well done, Oliver,
