1
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:05,319
Hotel Acuna, please.

2
00:02:15,529 --> 00:02:18,123
- What's his name?
- Eduardo Acuna. He's the big boss.

3
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:20,439
- Here's his office.
- Oh, thanks.

4
00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:21,928
Oh, boy.

5
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:27,208
I'll get you later. Thanks.

6
00:02:27,369 --> 00:02:31,203
I absolutely, positively
cannot interrupt Mr. Acuna.

7
00:02:31,369 --> 00:02:32,961
He is busy.

8
00:02:34,249 --> 00:02:36,524
Sorry, those are my orders.

9
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,566
Please don't blame me.

10
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:42,639
- When he's free, I'd like to see him.
- I ask myself the same question.

11
00:02:42,809 --> 00:02:46,848
Why see Mr. Acuna when there are so
many pleasant people they could see?

12
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:49,439
Tell him Robert Davis
of New York is here.

13
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:52,123
- Robert Davis.
- <i>Yes?</i>

14
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:55,201
Mr. Robert Davis of New York
to see you, Mr. Acuna.

15
00:02:55,369 --> 00:02:58,042
<i>I never heard of him.</i>
<i>Tell him to go away.</i>

16
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:03,808
Well, I must say, I'm used to
more cordiality than that.

17
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:05,846
He's making a big mistake.

18
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:10,127
Mr. Davis, you impress me.
What did you want to see him about?

19
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:13,683
That.

20
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:15,357
What?

21
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:18,763
That.

22
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:21,962
- I only asked you a civil question.
- And I answered you.

23
00:03:28,649 --> 00:03:32,164
- You don't mind if I wait?
- No, but it won't do you any good.

24
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:36,005
That's very nice. The wedding dress
and the lingerie, I approve.

25
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:37,887
You may go, and thank you.

26
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:41,919
Well, darling,
what's been going on here?

27
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:45,638
Eduardo had a slight disagreement
with Delfina about Julia's trousseau...

28
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,686
...so now he's picking out
one himself.

29
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:50,841
It's my invariable rule to distrust
women's taste in clothes.

30
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:52,522
That's why he asked me to come by.

31
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:54,919
First time I heard of a father
selecting a trousseau.

32
00:03:55,089 --> 00:03:58,286
You know as well as I do that women
dress for one another, not for men.

33
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:00,679
Delfina's mother put her in fluff
when I married her.

34
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:03,522
She's been in fluff ever since.
Does your son like fluff?

35
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:07,045
My dear, for the first few weeks,
he won't know what Julia's wearing.

36
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:10,360
- Will your wife forgive you for this?
- Forgive me? I expect to be thanked.

37
00:04:10,529 --> 00:04:14,681
- And thank you, Maria, for coming.
- That's all right. Goodbye, Eduardo.

38
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:27,725
- Who are you, the florist?
- Do I look like a florist?

39
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:30,926
How do I know what a florist
looks like? Who are you?

40
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:33,205
Xavier Cugat, remember me?

41
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:36,566
Didn't I bring you down here
from New York for something?

42
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:39,562
My orchestra has packed
your Sky Room for the past two weeks.

43
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:40,957
That is something!

44
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:44,087
I never go to the Sky Room.
My cover charge is too high.

45
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:47,486
Of course! You're to play
at my daughter's wedding tomorrow.

46
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:49,447
Very well.

47
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:55,847
Play this softly and remotely,
as though you were not there.

48
00:04:56,529 --> 00:05:00,488
Mr. Acuna, you can forget my name,
stay away from the Sky Room...

49
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:04,801
...underpay me, but you cannot
dictate how my orchestra should play.

50
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:09,606
You play this softly.

51
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:15,006
How I wish I was back at the Waldorf.

52
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:27,127
- Bob Davis!
- Cugie!

53
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:28,483
What are you doing here?

54
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:31,368
I just came down for a holiday.
I didn't know you were here.

55
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:33,918
A holiday? You didn't know
there was a racetrack here?

56
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:36,239
- Well, yes, and...
- And now you're broke again?

57
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:38,877
Yep, I gotta put these feet
back to work for a while.

58
00:05:39,049 --> 00:05:42,837
But, gee, I like it here. You know,
the people, the city, the horses.

59
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,558
But this fellow, Acuna, he's tough.
He won't see me.

60
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:48,685
Acuna won't see him?

61
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,124
Why, in New York,
he won't see Acuna.

62
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:54,247
This, Fernando,
is the greatest man in the world.

63
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:57,924
Tell Acuna that Mr. Davis will give him
just two minutes of his time.

64
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:00,523
Oh, no. You tell him.

65
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:02,403
Yes, Mr. Acuna?

66
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:06,244
<i>Remind me to give Cugat back</i>
<i>to the Waldorf. He annoys m</i>e.

67
00:06:08,489 --> 00:06:11,526
Very funny man.
He kills me.

68
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:15,807
You know, actually I have a great deal
of influence with Acuna. What's that?

69
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:18,483
I didn't say a thing.
Just minding my own business.

70
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:22,608
Come along. I've a show to do. While
we play, we'll think of something.

71
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:57,007
Terrific! I've made up my mind.
We'll work together again!

72
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:00,479
- With you, we'll be better than terrific.
- I don't like Acuna's attitude.

73
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:03,527
- I'm going to change it right now.
- No, I have a better way.

74
00:09:03,689 --> 00:09:06,886
I'm playing at his daughter's wedding.
You will sing, you will dance.

75
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:11,679
You will be sensational!
Acuna will come to you on his knees.

76
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,128
It's almost time, Julia.

77
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:30,599
Here's your something old, sis, and
a new coin for your something new.

78
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:31,997
Thanks, Lita.

79
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:34,125
And Mama's handkerchief
for something borrowed.

80
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:36,041
Here's something blue, Julia.

81
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,882
The bridegroom's supposed
to sleep on it, or something.

82
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:41,927
I suppose I should put
the coin in my shoe.

83
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:46,568
You'll be the next bride
in the family, Maria.

84
00:09:46,729 --> 00:09:50,438
- Oh, no. Not me.
- Oh, but you have to be.

85
00:09:50,609 --> 00:09:53,840
Papa made it very clear that we can't
get married until after you do.

86
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:57,160
He says it's our family tradition
that the girls be disposed of...

87
00:09:57,329 --> 00:09:59,081
...one, two, three, four.

88
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:00,762
And you'll be the oldest now.

89
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:03,045
Papa will get over that silly tradition.

90
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:06,884
No, he won't.
Papa never gets over anything.

91
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:11,044
You don't expect to marry those
two tennis-playing Romeos, do you?

92
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:13,928
But we love Tony and Roddy
passionately.

93
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:17,559
They've even given us
their signet rings, see?

94
00:10:17,729 --> 00:10:19,526
Why, you're babies.

95
00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:24,638
You just don't know what it's like to be
so much in love that you cry all night.

96
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:26,123
You're right there.

97
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:29,361
It's all right for you to talk.
You turn men down by the dozens.

98
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,360
You've got an ice cube for a heart.

99
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:35,363
- Unaccustomed as I am to getting a...
- There's something wrong with Maria.

100
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:40,000
- She says she'll never get married.
- I did not say that.

101
00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:44,765
You know, Papa, I think you'd better
put a cooling system in their room.

102
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:48,968
Now, you leave Maria to me.
Don't worry, she's next...

103
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:51,723
...and then will come your turn,
and then yours.

104
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:53,959
- Do we have to wait for Maria?
- Yes.

105
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:56,802
And this is a fine way to act
on your sister's wedding day.

106
00:10:56,969 --> 00:10:59,358
Now, run along
and fix your pretty faces.

107
00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:06,328
Getting nervous, dear?
We're going to miss you.

108
00:11:06,489 --> 00:11:09,208
Has Mama forgiven you yet
for picking out my trousseau?

109
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,882
I don't know. Her door was locked.

110
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:13,768
She broke down and confessed
that she liked my dress.

111
00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:18,400
These skirmishes I have with your
mother are not typical of married life.

112
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,563
- Aren't they, Father?
- No, they're just typical of me.

113
00:11:21,729 --> 00:11:24,641
- I'm very difficult to live with.
- No, you're not, darling.

114
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,198
You're really just a little boy,
and I love you.

115
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:29,405
And I love you too, darling.

116
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:30,888
Will you hook me, Eduardo?

117
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:34,280
Delfina, don't you think it's about time
you learned to dress yourself?

118
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:37,566
It's so hard for me to believe I'm old
enough to have a married daughter.

119
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:39,959
It doesn't put any strain on me.

120
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:43,002
Julia.
Where are the rest of my girls?

121
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,967
Oh, Maria! Lita! Cecy!

122
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:48,643
- Coming, Mother.
- Coming, Mama!

123
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,922
I want to see you all in a row.

124
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:58,043
Oh! I'm going to cry tonight.

125
00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:02,361
You'd better start now. It's getting late.
Do you want some last-minute advice?

126
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:04,645
Just don't act too intelligent
on your honeymoon.

127
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:06,686
I made that mistake with your father.

128
00:12:06,849 --> 00:12:10,524
That reminds me. Tell me something
clever to say after the wedding.

129
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:13,647
Oh, dear, I'm so happy.

130
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:17,598
Hurry, girls.
Now remember, keep in step.

131
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:20,966
I am going to cry.
I'm going to cry right now.

132
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,686
He didn't even look around.

133
00:14:47,849 --> 00:14:52,320
Have your son pass the word. I have
three more where Julia came from.

134
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:56,645
- You two ask Papa now.
- While he's laughing.

135
00:14:57,369 --> 00:14:58,722
Come on.

136
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:04,721
- Mr. Acuna.
- Yes?

137
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:08,165
We've been going with your daughters
Cecy and Lita for two years now and...

138
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:10,559
What do you want, a pension?

139
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:20,002
- All right, who's going to be next?
- I am.

140
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:23,684
- Maria has to catch it.
- Yes.

141
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:30,557
But I don't want it.

142
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,289
- Here's a volunteer groom.
- Let's have a double wedding.

143
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:35,041
- I'm between engagements.
- Here I am.

144
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:36,483
How about me?

145
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:39,807
Oh, you're all much too kind.

146
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:47,648
Papa! Papa! Did you see Maria?
She froze those boys.

147
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:51,040
Papa, you've just got
to do something about her.

148
00:15:58,289 --> 00:16:01,599
Pardon me, could you please tell me
where I could find Mr. Acuna?

149
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:03,680
He went inside.

150
00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:11,321
On second thought,
I guess old e<i>l</i> groucho can wait.

151
00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:15,406
Don't these overdone weddings
bore you to death? They kill me.

152
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:17,958
I say if two people want
to get married, let them.

153
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:22,088
They don't have to go through
a shindig like this. It's murder.

154
00:16:29,169 --> 00:16:33,321
Oh, well, I'll admit my attempt
at conversation wasn't so hot.

155
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:37,720
Shall I try again?

156
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:44,080
It's a nice day, isn't it?

157
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:47,405
The air's nice.

158
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:52,326
And there seems to be
an abundance of it.

159
00:16:54,569 --> 00:16:59,563
Say, look, would you mind very much
if I tear myself away from you?

160
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:01,323
No.

161
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:14,882
But you don't understand.

162
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:18,564
Now, let's hear no more about Maria.
Run along, girls.

163
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:24,118
May I see you a moment, please?
It's very important to both of us.

164
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:27,884
I'm Robert Davis.
I came here to dance and...

165
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:29,448
Hello.

166
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:34,287
Now, what is there about that girl
that made you go...?

167
00:17:34,449 --> 00:17:36,167
She's beautiful.

168
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,563
She's beautiful, all right.

169
00:17:38,729 --> 00:17:41,607
But she has a personality
like the inside of a refrigerator.

170
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,839
In addition to which,
she is my daughter.

171
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:45,920
She is? She is?!

172
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:49,479
She is. Now, what was it
you wanted of me?

173
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,718
Just your permission to go out
and hang myself.

174
00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:02,082
<i>Fernando.</i>

175
00:18:07,209 --> 00:18:08,642
<i>Fernando!</i>

176
00:18:10,729 --> 00:18:11,923
<i>Fernando!</i>

177
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:14,722
What?

178
00:18:15,129 --> 00:18:17,438
<i>Were you sl</i>ee<i>ping again?</i>

179
00:18:17,609 --> 00:18:22,205
<i>Tell me, my dear Fernando,</i>
<i>why do I put up with you?</i>

180
00:18:22,889 --> 00:18:24,481
I don't know, Mr. Acuna...

181
00:18:24,649 --> 00:18:28,642
...unless it's because I'm your
third cousin on your wife's side.

182
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,806
Ah, yes. Did you get Mrs. Castro?

183
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:35,967
Mrs. Castro is on her way here.

184
00:18:36,129 --> 00:18:37,960
<i>All right.</i>

185
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:42,406
<i>Now go back to sl</i>ee<i>p, Fernando.</i>

186
00:18:44,729 --> 00:18:46,845
<i>I dare you to!</i>

187
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:51,159
- Hi, Fernando.
- Good morning, Mr. Davis.

188
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:54,401
It's good to hear the voice
of a human being again. Sit down?

189
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:57,925
No, thanks. I'd like to see
Mr. Acuna if he's not busy.

190
00:18:58,089 --> 00:19:00,649
This morning he's nervous.
He probably won't see you.

191
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:02,561
- How'd you make out?
- Oh, fine.

192
00:19:02,729 --> 00:19:06,244
I opened my mouth too wide
and kept it open too long.

193
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:09,082
I want to apologize to the old boy.

194
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:12,488
Mr. Robert Davis wants
to see you, Mr. Acuna.

195
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:15,322
<i>I don't lik</i> e <i>Mr. Robert Davis.</i>
<i>I don't want to s</i>ee <i>him.</i>

196
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:17,923
<i>Advise him to go back to New York</i>
<i>and don't be subtl</i>e.

197
00:19:18,089 --> 00:19:19,442
<i>Throw him out!</i>

198
00:19:19,609 --> 00:19:21,918
But look, Mr. Acuna, I just...

199
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:27,687
This is the first time anything
like this has ever happened to me.

200
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,522
Oh, lady.

201
00:19:31,689 --> 00:19:34,567
Better not to go in there. Nervous.

202
00:19:38,529 --> 00:19:40,679
- Good morning, Maria.
- Eduardo.

203
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:44,444
I'm a worried man. Maria,
besides having the same name...

204
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:47,203
...you and my Maria have a lot
in common, haven't you?

205
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:49,439
Well, I'm her godmother,
we should have.

206
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:53,807
Would you say she has a personality
like the inside of a refrigerator?

207
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:55,728
I certainly would not.

208
00:19:55,889 --> 00:19:59,086
But she freezes men to death.
She turns on that sophistication...

209
00:19:59,249 --> 00:20:01,001
Sophistication, fiddlesticks!

210
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:03,239
Maria's as old-fashioned
as a hoop skirt.

211
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:05,445
Ridiculous! I know my own daughter.

212
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:07,486
You think you know
your own daughter.

213
00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:09,162
I know there's something wrong.

214
00:20:09,329 --> 00:20:11,524
She hasn't fallen in love
since she was 15...

215
00:20:11,689 --> 00:20:14,999
...when she got starry-eyed about
that silly knight on a white horse.

216
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:16,648
- Lochinvar?
- Yes.

217
00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:19,039
You'd think she'd have outgrown
a tin hero by now.

218
00:20:19,209 --> 00:20:21,598
She's probably waiting
for a myth to come to life.

219
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:26,160
Oh, nonsense! Will you stop thinking
of Maria as a child? She's a woman.

220
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:30,038
I know women. They all fall in love
with an illusion. I'll get her over that.

221
00:20:30,209 --> 00:20:33,121
Will you leave Maria alone
and stop worrying?

222
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:36,008
Someday, a man will come along
who will stir her imagination.

223
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:37,443
How?

224
00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:40,243
By doing something
more romantic than the others.

225
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:42,001
Such as?

226
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:47,118
Well, perhaps by sending her flowers
from an "unknown admirer"...

227
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:50,884
...intriguing her
with just the right kind of note.

228
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:55,721
Fernando! Get the two most
beautiful orchids you can find.

229
00:20:55,889 --> 00:20:58,039
Bring them here for a note
to be attached.

230
00:20:58,209 --> 00:21:00,962
Eduardo, don't you meddle with this.

231
00:21:01,129 --> 00:21:03,040
If I don't do something,
she'll get hurt.

232
00:21:03,209 --> 00:21:06,997
I won't stand by and let her waste the
best years of her life chasing knights.

233
00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:10,400
Have you gone crazy?
You can't manufacture romance.

234
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,129
I'll create an unknown admirer
and see what happens.

235
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:16,486
I'll use my left hand
to disguise my writing. Clever?

236
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:19,368
You think you have the answer
for everything.

237
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:22,089
What if she falls in love
with your imaginary lover?

238
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:24,888
Don't worry. If the orchids
and notes intrigue her...

239
00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:28,724
...l'll furnish the young man myself.
She'll never know the difference.

240
00:21:28,889 --> 00:21:30,880
Dearly beloved...

241
00:21:31,649 --> 00:21:34,607
Eduardo, I'm warning you.

242
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:08,199
- Papa! Hello, Aunt Maria.
- Hello.

243
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:10,357
What are you doing here?

244
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,884
Must I have an invitation
to my own home for tea?

245
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:16,007
- Is that you, Eduardo?
- Yes, yes.

246
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,761
What on earth are you doing here?

247
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:20,841
You'd think my only privilege
in this house was paying the bills.

248
00:22:21,009 --> 00:22:22,727
Aunt Maria, it's good to see you.

249
00:22:22,889 --> 00:22:25,608
- Wasn't that the doorbell?
- Expecting somebody, Papa?

250
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:28,681
No, why should I be expecting
somebody? Sit down, Maria.

251
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:30,328
Thank you.

252
00:22:33,129 --> 00:22:36,087
I'm really upset with your son, Maria...

253
00:22:36,249 --> 00:22:38,524
...and with your daughter Julia,
Eduardo!

254
00:22:38,689 --> 00:22:40,919
I went to the hotel
where they're honeymooning.

255
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:44,365
- What for? In the name of all...
- Don't speak when I'm interrupting.

256
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,565
To see if there was anything
I could do for them.

257
00:22:46,729 --> 00:22:47,957
As if there would be.

258
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:52,048
I thought they'd want to discuss what
they intend to do on their honeymoon.

259
00:22:52,209 --> 00:22:54,484
But they sent down word
they weren't in.

260
00:22:54,649 --> 00:22:56,287
Perhaps they weren't, Delfina.

261
00:22:56,449 --> 00:22:59,725
At the same time, they also sent down
for a bottle of champagne.

262
00:22:59,889 --> 00:23:01,959
- I felt like...
- Wasn't that the doorbell?

263
00:23:02,129 --> 00:23:05,758
Something's wrong with Papa.
He's always hearing bells.

264
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:21,564
Well, well, well! Orchids.

265
00:23:21,729 --> 00:23:24,004
Shame on Tony.
He should save his money.

266
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:27,445
- How do you know they're not for me?
- Bring me the flowers, Cecy.

267
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:30,440
Why, there's a card inside.

268
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,645
Nobody ever sends me flowers.

269
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:34,128
After a woman gets married...

270
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:36,484
...her husband decides
she can't smell anymore.

271
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:39,527
Now, don't get that martyred look.
They're for Maria.

272
00:23:39,689 --> 00:23:42,761
- For Maria?
- Why, they... They are for Maria.

273
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:45,284
Well, somebody's
just trying to be funny.

274
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:48,124
"Dearly beloved,
I send you orchids..."

275
00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:50,564
- Let Maria read her own card.
- Go ahead, Mama.

276
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,845
It probably ends up with a joke.

277
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:58,367
"...because my heart is no longer mine,
now that I have seen you.

278
00:23:58,529 --> 00:24:00,724
Be kind to these orchids.

279
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:05,917
It is not their fault that they can
never be as lovely as you."

280
00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:08,604
Why, it brought tears to my eyes.

281
00:24:08,769 --> 00:24:11,078
That note was written by a man
with a sensitive soul.

282
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:13,604
It sounded pretty silly to me.

283
00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:16,761
A charming man sends you the most
beautiful note ever written...

284
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:18,442
...and you say it sounds silly?

285
00:24:18,609 --> 00:24:22,682
"Your unknown suitor." And I don't
think much of his handwriting.

286
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:25,609
Well, perhaps he's left-handed.

287
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:29,118
How does this card strike you,
Aunt Maria?

288
00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:32,201
If it had been sent to me
and I didn't know who'd written it...

289
00:24:32,369 --> 00:24:36,328
...I should think it was pretty silly.
- Aunt Maria's right.

290
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,198
Whoever he is,
he'll have to do better than that.

291
00:24:39,369 --> 00:24:41,485
Let me see the card, Maria, please.

292
00:24:43,129 --> 00:24:45,689
- What are you two whispering about?
- Well, l...

293
00:24:45,849 --> 00:24:48,727
I was saying that if that note
didn't warm Maria's heart...

294
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:51,881
...the next one, I believe,
may well start a flame within her.

295
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:55,007
Why, Eduardo, you remind me
of our courting days.

296
00:24:55,169 --> 00:24:57,888
He was always telling me
how I lit a flame in him.

297
00:24:58,049 --> 00:25:00,005
Sometimes I wonder
if it hasn't gone out.

298
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:02,319
I'll have you know that
I'm twice the man I was.

299
00:25:02,489 --> 00:25:05,606
I would settle for half the man
you were, dear.

300
00:25:17,969 --> 00:25:19,766
Here are the love lyrics you wanted.

301
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:22,568
The love songs and
the great love letters of Napoleon.

302
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,720
Just put them down and get out.

303
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:34,723
Sorry!

304
00:26:15,249 --> 00:26:17,558
Right on time, 5:00.

305
00:26:27,809 --> 00:26:32,485
You know, Louise, I'm beginning
to wonder what he's like.

306
00:26:54,129 --> 00:26:55,357
She's in love at last.

307
00:26:55,529 --> 00:26:58,407
I'm going to wear Tony's ring
where everybody can see it.

308
00:26:58,569 --> 00:27:01,288
Now we can be secretly engaged
and tell everybody.

309
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:50,521
- No orchids for almost a week.
- Sunk again.

310
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:53,203
I guess we'd better
put our rings back.

311
00:28:56,649 --> 00:28:57,877
Hello.

312
00:28:58,049 --> 00:29:00,882
Oh, hello, Papa.
When did you get back in town?

313
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:03,802
Just now. How's everything at home?

314
00:29:03,969 --> 00:29:06,688
Oh, we're all right,
but Maria's in the dumps.

315
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:09,522
Maria, in the dumps? Why?

316
00:29:09,689 --> 00:29:11,680
She hasn't received orchids all week.

317
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:14,409
No orchids all week?
How stupid of me!

318
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:17,720
I mean, tell her, of course, that
no one's been making a fool of her.

319
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:19,686
No, don't tell her anything.

320
00:29:20,129 --> 00:29:22,802
Well, how does she know
the orchid sender didn't get sick?

321
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:27,201
Well, say hello to your mother.
See you soon. Goodbye.

322
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:40,002
Dearly beloved...

323
00:29:41,169 --> 00:29:45,606
...although I have been
desperately ill...

324
00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:48,000
...in my delirium, they...

325
00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:53,402
In my delirium,
they told me I asked only for you.

326
00:29:55,369 --> 00:29:59,681
Have you got my number? 3790.

327
00:30:00,689 --> 00:30:02,600
This time, he's shaving.

328
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:05,329
No, don't bring
a lottery ticket in here.

329
00:30:05,489 --> 00:30:07,639
I can escape to the lobby
for a moment.

330
00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:11,358
- I'll see you there. Right now.
- Did you give him my message?

331
00:30:11,529 --> 00:30:15,124
Yes, and he said to have you arrested
for trespassing if you came in again.

332
00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:18,326
Mr. Davis, give up.
He'll never see you.

333
00:30:18,489 --> 00:30:21,799
<i>Fernando. Send a bellboy</i>
<i>in here immediately.</i>

334
00:30:37,889 --> 00:30:39,083
Mr. Acuna?

335
00:30:39,249 --> 00:30:41,126
There's money
and a note on my desk.

336
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:43,200
Take them,
buy two magnificent orchids...

337
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:46,964
...attach the note, then take the
flowers to my home. Is that clear?

338
00:30:48,329 --> 00:30:50,718
Yes, sir. But first, could I see...?

339
00:30:50,889 --> 00:30:54,802
Hurry it up! This is an emergency.
And bring back the change.

340
00:30:55,449 --> 00:30:56,802
Yes, sir.

341
00:30:57,209 --> 00:30:59,040
I'll be back.

342
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:10,446
"Dearly beloved, dearly beloved...

343
00:31:10,609 --> 00:31:13,203
...dearly beloved, dearly beloved."

344
00:31:13,369 --> 00:31:16,441
- I wouldn't take it so hard.
- I'm not taking anything hard.

345
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:20,966
Beware of note writers who haven't
the courage to court you face to face.

346
00:31:25,689 --> 00:31:28,761
Even my clock's slow.

347
00:31:31,969 --> 00:31:34,085
No, it isn't. Look, dear. Look.

348
00:31:55,169 --> 00:31:58,161
"For Miss Maria Acuna."
Thank you, sir.

349
00:31:58,329 --> 00:32:01,719
Thank you with all my heart and soul.

350
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:05,369
You're an angel.

351
00:32:15,129 --> 00:32:19,088
Hoist the anchor, Cecy,
we're in again.

352
00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:26,519
You know, I think
I've seen him before.

353
00:32:31,209 --> 00:32:34,565
Louise, would you be a darling and
pick up the pieces of notes I tore up?

354
00:32:34,729 --> 00:32:36,526
Yes, yes.

355
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:41,922
"Dearly beloved..."

356
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:46,209
Jumping blue blazes!

357
00:32:46,209 --> 00:32:48,006
Jumping blue blazes!

358
00:32:48,169 --> 00:32:51,366
Can't you even order a teapot
for that hotel without calling me?

359
00:32:51,529 --> 00:32:54,885
Why do I put up with it?
All right, all right.

360
00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:56,801
Maybe I can fly up next week.

361
00:32:56,969 --> 00:32:59,278
In the meanwhile, start looking
for another profession.

362
00:32:59,449 --> 00:33:03,203
One that won't require the use of that
addled fraction of a brain of yours.

363
00:33:03,369 --> 00:33:05,439
Mr. Acuna, here's your change.

364
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:08,442
Two pesos, 50 centavos.

365
00:33:08,609 --> 00:33:11,760
- What are you doing here?
- I delivered the orchids for you...

366
00:33:11,929 --> 00:33:15,046
...now you're going...
- You delivered the orchids?

367
00:33:15,209 --> 00:33:19,202
I'm not gonna try to figure out how
you substituted yourself for a bellboy.

368
00:33:19,369 --> 00:33:22,167
Mr. Acuna, I've been trying for days
to dance for you.

369
00:33:22,329 --> 00:33:26,242
You're the only man who's ever
refused to see my work, and I resent it.

370
00:33:26,409 --> 00:33:28,320
Get out of my office!

371
00:33:28,769 --> 00:33:31,966
Now, look, this is a matter of pride
with me. I don't like to dance, see?

372
00:33:32,129 --> 00:33:34,518
I came down here to get away from it.

373
00:33:34,689 --> 00:33:36,168
Shall I have you thrown out?

374
00:33:36,329 --> 00:33:39,526
You can't talk that way to me.
Honest, I'm an important guy.

375
00:33:39,689 --> 00:33:41,486
Now, you're gonna see me dance
and like it.

376
00:33:41,649 --> 00:33:42,877
Oh, no, I'm not.

377
00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:46,359
Oh, yes, you are. Take it, boys.
One, two.

378
00:35:53,449 --> 00:35:57,158
- Well?
- Excellent. Beautiful.

379
00:35:57,329 --> 00:35:59,843
But I don't want it.
Mr. Davis...

380
00:36:00,009 --> 00:36:03,888
...you do something to me that results
in the most fascinating dislike ever.

381
00:36:04,049 --> 00:36:07,121
- May I make an observation?
- You may make your exit!

382
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:11,248
Mr. Acuna, your overwhelming
graciousness bewilders me.

383
00:36:11,409 --> 00:36:13,923
However, I bear no grudges.

384
00:36:15,889 --> 00:36:18,039
When you change your mind, call me.

385
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,006
Out of my sight!

386
00:36:20,169 --> 00:36:23,081
Thank you again for your welcome.

387
00:36:29,249 --> 00:36:31,843
You let that jumping jack in my office.

388
00:36:32,009 --> 00:36:35,240
You'll pay for this with every drop
of your anaemic blood.

389
00:36:35,409 --> 00:36:37,923
You nincompoop! You worm!

390
00:36:38,089 --> 00:36:42,002
You're fired! Now get out and never
come back, you diddling dimwit.

391
00:36:42,169 --> 00:36:43,921
"Diddling dimwit"?

392
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:48,039
Welcome home, Papa.

393
00:36:48,209 --> 00:36:50,882
I could have sworn
I heard you swearing.

394
00:36:51,049 --> 00:36:52,482
Why, I thought you were...

395
00:36:52,649 --> 00:36:55,083
Aren't you looking extraordinarily
happy about something?

396
00:36:55,249 --> 00:36:57,683
- I am happy.
- Couldn't be orchids, could it?

397
00:36:57,849 --> 00:36:59,680
And I'll let you in on a secret.

398
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:02,727
I know who's been
sending me the flowers.

399
00:37:03,329 --> 00:37:06,765
You do? Now, look, darling,
everything can be explained.

400
00:37:06,929 --> 00:37:10,080
- What do you mean?
- Tell me what you're talking about.

401
00:37:10,249 --> 00:37:12,160
The orchids, the notes.

402
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:14,445
- I know who sent them.
- You do?

403
00:37:14,609 --> 00:37:17,248
- Well, you don't seem brokenhearted.
- Well, why should I be?

404
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:22,085
- I'm glad you're taking it this way...
- Tell me what you're talking about.

405
00:37:22,249 --> 00:37:25,161
- Tell me who you're talking about.
- Oh, Mr. Acuna?

406
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:27,843
When you change your mind,
I'll be up in Room 920.

407
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:33,203
Oh, Papa, that's who
I'm talking about. He's the one.

408
00:37:33,369 --> 00:37:35,360
- He's what?
- The one who's in love with me.

409
00:37:35,529 --> 00:37:37,281
- He is not!
- Oh, yes, yes.

410
00:37:37,449 --> 00:37:40,043
I saw him bring
the orchids this afternoon.

411
00:37:40,209 --> 00:37:42,677
Oh, I remember.
He sang at the wedding.

412
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:45,602
I tell you, he's not the one
who's been sending you the flowers!

413
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:49,478
If he is, he's a pest!
He's not only a pest, he's a dancer!

414
00:37:51,729 --> 00:37:55,688
- How wonderful. I love...
- He's not for you! He's out of work!

415
00:37:55,849 --> 00:37:57,646
Then you give him work,
for me.

416
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:01,688
Don't tell me you could do anything so
ghastly as to get mixed up with him.

417
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:04,317
And to think I was cool to him
at the wedding.

418
00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:06,923
I forbid you
to fall in love with this man!

419
00:38:07,089 --> 00:38:09,887
And besides, it's too late.
He's going somewhere.

420
00:38:10,049 --> 00:38:11,482
New York, I hope.

421
00:38:11,649 --> 00:38:14,880
Well, maybe I can change his mind.

422
00:38:15,649 --> 00:38:18,083
You should read what he wrote to me.

423
00:38:18,249 --> 00:38:21,605
No. No, on second thought,
I don't think your heart could stand it.

424
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:26,285
- Anybody can write a love letter.
- I'd like to see you try it.

425
00:38:26,449 --> 00:38:29,600
Anyway, he's not leaving
South America...

426
00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:32,966
...if I can help it.
And I think I can.

427
00:38:33,129 --> 00:38:36,678
- What was his room number?
- My mind's a blank. I've forgotten.

428
00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:38,567
I haven't.

429
00:38:38,729 --> 00:38:40,287
920, please.

430
00:38:40,449 --> 00:38:42,724
You ask him to the house tonight.

431
00:38:43,969 --> 00:38:47,120
What's gotten into you, Maria?
Nice girls don't act this way.

432
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:50,645
- Nice girls don't feel the way I do.
- Why, you're brazen.

433
00:38:50,809 --> 00:38:52,003
How could I be...

434
00:38:52,169 --> 00:38:54,558
...with a heart like an ice cube?
- I didn't say that.

435
00:38:54,729 --> 00:38:58,881
That gleam in your eye has nothing
to do with ice cubes. It's predatory.

436
00:38:59,049 --> 00:39:01,279
Maybe you're right.

437
00:39:01,769 --> 00:39:03,964
- 920, please.
- All right.

438
00:39:04,129 --> 00:39:06,404
When I've signed those papers,
I'll ask him.

439
00:39:06,569 --> 00:39:08,639
You're a very sweet papa.

440
00:39:08,809 --> 00:39:12,597
Oh, and I'll have to hurry.
I've only got three hours to dress.

441
00:39:13,449 --> 00:39:14,928
Bye, sweets.

442
00:39:16,009 --> 00:39:18,967
- Why did you have to tell him off?
- Don't worry, he'll come around.

443
00:39:19,129 --> 00:39:21,199
Oh, you don't know him.

444
00:39:21,369 --> 00:39:24,998
You know, Acuna is the most
opinionated man in South America.

445
00:39:25,169 --> 00:39:27,160
I'll show you.

446
00:39:39,049 --> 00:39:40,607
See that nose?

447
00:39:40,769 --> 00:39:43,806
That nose shows opinionation.

448
00:40:00,129 --> 00:40:02,597
His ears indicate mulishness.

449
00:40:04,729 --> 00:40:08,324
His forehead slopes like a tin roof.

450
00:40:10,089 --> 00:40:14,241
- No intellect whatsoever.
- What about his chin?

451
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:17,287
Oh, his chin clearly indicates
weakness of character.

452
00:40:17,929 --> 00:40:22,480
Handlebar moustache,
no sense of humour.

453
00:40:22,649 --> 00:40:26,688
His droopy eyelids
indicate he's a dope.

454
00:40:26,849 --> 00:40:29,317
Very flattering, Cugat.

455
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:36,325
- Oh, Mr. Acuna.
- The Sky Room is going to miss you.

456
00:40:36,489 --> 00:40:38,559
In the meanwhile,
I will speak to Mr. Davis alone.

457
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:41,926
Sure, sure.
Will you excuse me, please?

458
00:40:46,889 --> 00:40:49,801
Mr. Davis, I find myself
in an embarrassing position.

459
00:40:49,969 --> 00:40:52,403
Think nothing of it, sir.
We all make mistakes.

460
00:40:52,569 --> 00:40:55,288
- When do I start dancing?
- You do not start dancing.

461
00:40:55,449 --> 00:40:57,519
- Didn't you come to see about...?
- One of my daughters.

462
00:40:57,689 --> 00:41:02,558
The one you so gallantly referred to
as the "inside of a refrigerator."

463
00:41:02,729 --> 00:41:04,799
But I'm afraid I don't follow you.

464
00:41:04,969 --> 00:41:07,529
She thinks you're in love with her.

465
00:41:08,129 --> 00:41:11,565
Would it be rude of me to inquire
if there's any insanity in your family?

466
00:41:11,729 --> 00:41:14,562
And what's worse, she has the
illusion that she's in love with you.

467
00:41:14,729 --> 00:41:18,199
- Oh, my. Poor child.
- It's not her fault. It's yours.

468
00:41:18,929 --> 00:41:22,763
- I still don't follow you.
- You took her the orchids, didn't you?

469
00:41:22,929 --> 00:41:25,682
Why, I left some orchids
at your door, yes.

470
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:28,966
But what's that got to do with the
idea I'm in love with your daughter?

471
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:33,158
She's been receiving orchids and
love notes from an unknown admirer.

472
00:41:34,009 --> 00:41:37,240
- Then she thinks I'm the fellow?
- So you've stirred her imagination.

473
00:41:37,409 --> 00:41:40,082
I don't want to stir her imagination.
I didn't write any notes.

474
00:41:40,249 --> 00:41:42,604
Don't you think I know that?
I wrote those notes myself.

475
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:46,205
- You? Then there is insanity.
- No, there isn't.

476
00:41:46,369 --> 00:41:49,122
All you've got to do is to
let her think you wrote those notes.

477
00:41:49,289 --> 00:41:52,645
- I see. Then what?
- Then disillusion her.

478
00:41:52,809 --> 00:41:55,039
- Tell her I didn't send the flowers?
- Of course not.

479
00:41:55,209 --> 00:41:58,565
Her pride would be crushed. She's got
to believe that you admire her...

480
00:41:58,729 --> 00:42:02,563
...and yet for her own happiness, she's
got to lose her infatuation for you.

481
00:42:03,049 --> 00:42:05,005
That's easy. Just tell her I'm a heel.

482
00:42:05,169 --> 00:42:07,603
I want her to discover that
for herself.

483
00:42:08,209 --> 00:42:10,040
Yeah? How?

484
00:42:10,209 --> 00:42:13,281
By being your own obnoxious self
when you come to my house tonight.

485
00:42:13,449 --> 00:42:15,201
Oh, I'm coming to your house tonight?

486
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:16,848
To complete the disillusionment...

487
00:42:17,009 --> 00:42:19,682
...you'll tell her you're sailing
for North America tomorrow.

488
00:42:19,849 --> 00:42:22,966
But I'm not. I like it here.

489
00:42:23,289 --> 00:42:25,678
I'll pay your transportation
and a bonus as well.

490
00:42:25,849 --> 00:42:27,521
Thanks just the same, Mr. Acuna.

491
00:42:27,689 --> 00:42:30,442
My only interest at the moment
is in your Sky Room.

492
00:42:30,609 --> 00:42:34,443
If you do this for me, I'll give you a
contract to dance, at some future date.

493
00:42:34,609 --> 00:42:36,839
Will you put that in writing
and leave the date open?

494
00:42:37,009 --> 00:42:39,079
- Yes.
- Okay.

495
00:42:39,249 --> 00:42:41,638
- What time shall I show up?
- At 9:00.

496
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:45,527
And don't stay too late.

497
00:42:49,049 --> 00:42:52,280
- Something in my eye.
- A keyhole, no doubt.

498
00:42:52,449 --> 00:42:55,680
- Until tonight at 9.
- And I won't stay too late.

499
00:43:01,289 --> 00:43:02,881
Look what we found.

500
00:43:03,049 --> 00:43:05,358
Is this your Robert Davis?

501
00:43:06,049 --> 00:43:08,279
That's the one.
He brought the orchids.

502
00:43:08,449 --> 00:43:10,326
He's "The Idol of New York."

503
00:43:10,489 --> 00:43:11,808
I like his smile...

504
00:43:11,969 --> 00:43:14,358
...and the twinkle in his eye.
- Remember Mama's advice:

505
00:43:14,529 --> 00:43:16,406
Don't frighten him
with your intelligence.

506
00:43:16,569 --> 00:43:20,039
- Just act simple and mysterious.
- I know, make an entrance.

507
00:43:20,209 --> 00:43:22,484
Be casual, as though
I didn't know he was coming.

508
00:43:22,649 --> 00:43:25,288
That's right. Come on, Cecy.

509
00:43:30,049 --> 00:43:31,721
Eduardo.

510
00:43:34,729 --> 00:43:37,368
- Do I look all right?
- You're as beautiful as ever, my dear.

511
00:43:37,529 --> 00:43:39,884
It just takes longer now.

512
00:43:40,049 --> 00:43:41,801
Ouch!

513
00:43:41,969 --> 00:43:45,120
Oh, I forgot. I had a pin in my mouth.
Did it go in very deep?

514
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,962
I'll probably look like
a Ubangi by midnight.

515
00:43:48,449 --> 00:43:50,246
Hurry, it's 9:00.

516
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:54,088
If you giggle again, I'm going to
throw cold water in your face.

517
00:43:54,249 --> 00:43:56,843
You think Mr. Davis wants to marry
into a family of gigglers?

518
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,887
Maria won't marry this young man.
She's not going to like him.

519
00:44:00,049 --> 00:44:02,165
He has absolutely no good qualities.

520
00:44:02,329 --> 00:44:05,082
That's not for you to decide.

521
00:44:05,249 --> 00:44:09,083
I read in a book that a salmon swims
miles and miles to find a mate...

522
00:44:09,249 --> 00:44:10,967
...and Maria has swum long enough.

523
00:44:11,129 --> 00:44:13,848
Maria is going to wait
until the right man comes along.

524
00:44:14,009 --> 00:44:16,762
Why should she? I didn't.

525
00:44:21,169 --> 00:44:24,605
Oh, it's Mr. Davis. He can't meet us
scattered around the hall.

526
00:44:24,769 --> 00:44:27,442
- Hurry, Mama.
- Come on.

527
00:44:32,209 --> 00:44:35,087
- Good evening, Mr. Acuna.
- Mr. Davis.

528
00:44:35,249 --> 00:44:37,638
- Did you receive the contract?
- Yes, sir.

529
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:39,527
Then I can depend on you?

530
00:44:39,689 --> 00:44:42,249
Don't worry, she'll be disillusioned.

531
00:44:51,209 --> 00:44:53,882
Maria, may I present
Mr. Robert Davis.

532
00:44:54,089 --> 00:44:57,126
- We've met before, haven't we?
- Yes. No.

533
00:44:57,289 --> 00:44:59,359
That is... In a way, but...

534
00:44:59,529 --> 00:45:01,440
We will translate
that remarkable statement...

535
00:45:01,609 --> 00:45:04,919
...after you've met
the rest of the family.

536
00:45:09,729 --> 00:45:12,482
This is Mrs. Acuna.
My daughters Cecy and Lita.

537
00:45:12,649 --> 00:45:15,641
Mr. Robert Davis.
He can't stay long.

538
00:45:15,809 --> 00:45:18,801
Sit down, Mr. Davis.

539
00:45:25,609 --> 00:45:29,568
I accidentally read
one of your beautiful notes to Maria.

540
00:45:30,089 --> 00:45:33,798
It's a shame that such a talented
young man is unemployed, Eduardo.

541
00:45:33,969 --> 00:45:35,766
Oh, but didn't Mr. Acuna tell you?

542
00:45:35,929 --> 00:45:38,363
I'm to dance in his Sky Room
starting tomorrow night.

543
00:45:38,529 --> 00:45:41,760
- Isn't that so, Mr. Acuna?
- The date was left open.

544
00:45:41,929 --> 00:45:44,966
- But you meant tomorrow, didn't you?
- Oh, of course he did.

545
00:45:45,129 --> 00:45:48,644
And you're going to love
working for Papa. Isn't he?

546
00:45:48,809 --> 00:45:53,121
Oh, I'm sure I will.
Oh, I almost forgot.

547
00:45:53,409 --> 00:45:55,969
These are for you.
There's no note this time, because...

548
00:45:56,129 --> 00:46:00,008
I'd rather you'd say
what you might have written anyway.

549
00:46:15,169 --> 00:46:18,718
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Oh, of course not.

550
00:46:18,889 --> 00:46:20,925
No, thank you.

551
00:46:25,089 --> 00:46:27,364
Have I said something wrong?

552
00:46:27,529 --> 00:46:29,121
He thinks it's real.

553
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:32,122
I had it made
into a cigarette lighter, Mr. Davis.

554
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:35,042
Oh, I see.
For a moment, it looked real.

555
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:38,167
Oh, I guess it's killed
many a man in its day...

556
00:46:38,329 --> 00:46:40,206
...but it's only an antique now.

557
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:42,724
But you wouldn't mind
pointing it that way a little bit?

558
00:46:42,889 --> 00:46:46,677
- Of course not, but it's harmless.
- Oh, I'm sure it is.

559
00:46:50,729 --> 00:46:52,640
Do you mind?
I could stand a little air.

560
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:54,765
There's lots of it in the garden.

561
00:46:54,929 --> 00:46:56,965
Remember?

562
00:46:57,129 --> 00:46:59,040
- What if I'd killed him?
- Never mind him.

563
00:46:59,209 --> 00:47:00,801
What about the vase?

564
00:47:01,449 --> 00:47:04,521
Oh, now he'll never get back
into a romantic mood.

565
00:47:04,689 --> 00:47:08,284
Maybe some music would
quiet his nerves. Come on.

566
00:47:16,009 --> 00:47:18,921
After my notes, I must be
an awful disappointment to you.

567
00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:20,522
Oh, on the contrary.

568
00:47:20,689 --> 00:47:22,680
I like modest men.

569
00:47:23,609 --> 00:47:26,248
Well, I don't know exactly
how to tell you, but...

570
00:47:26,409 --> 00:47:28,479
I like bashfulness too.

571
00:47:33,329 --> 00:47:37,800
Your city is so cosmopolitan, and this
shack of yours is so magnificent...

572
00:47:37,969 --> 00:47:41,041
...frankly, I feel like
a duck out of water.

573
00:47:41,209 --> 00:47:43,359
I think you'd fit in anyplace.

574
00:47:43,529 --> 00:47:46,839
But I mean, I wouldn't fit into
this kind of life, your kind of life.

575
00:47:47,009 --> 00:47:49,159
I don't like it much either.

576
00:47:49,329 --> 00:47:51,718
But you don't know my kind of life.

577
00:47:51,889 --> 00:47:54,403
- It's music and dancing, isn't it?
- Yes.

578
00:47:54,569 --> 00:47:57,606
Well, we love your North American
music and dances down here.

579
00:47:57,769 --> 00:48:01,284
Oh, but imagine a man like me
having to dance for a living.

580
00:48:01,449 --> 00:48:03,644
I can't imagine a happier way
to earn one.

581
00:48:05,609 --> 00:48:07,520
There's a great weakness
in my character.

582
00:48:07,689 --> 00:48:10,408
- I'm a sucker for a horserace.
- They thrill me too.

583
00:48:10,569 --> 00:48:13,800
I'd probably bet my last cent on
a horse. As a matter of fact, I did.

584
00:48:13,969 --> 00:48:16,437
I have a gambler's heart myself.

585
00:48:16,609 --> 00:48:17,803
You know...

586
00:48:17,969 --> 00:48:21,439
...I think that's why
your notes intrigued me so.

587
00:48:22,689 --> 00:48:25,442
Look, little lady,
as they'd say in Brooklyn:

588
00:48:25,609 --> 00:48:29,841
"I can't bat in your league." I'm a plain,
ordinary guy from Omaha, Nebraska.

589
00:48:30,009 --> 00:48:32,967
Just an old-fashioned,
everyday Middle Westerner.

590
00:48:33,129 --> 00:48:36,326
Why, my grandfather
was a cattle raiser.

591
00:48:36,489 --> 00:48:38,207
So was mine!

592
00:48:39,329 --> 00:48:41,285
But you're streamlined. You're today.

593
00:48:41,449 --> 00:48:46,477
Sister, I was raised amongst the
grasshoppers. I am strictly from corn.

594
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,561
It's getting late, Mr. Davis.

595
00:53:20,729 --> 00:53:25,325
- It's your play, Eduardo.
- Well, I don't want that card.

596
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:28,444
Rummy.

597
00:53:39,729 --> 00:53:43,039
Am I the first girl you never kissed?

598
00:53:44,969 --> 00:53:48,086
I knew a fellow once who came
to a lull like this with a girl and...

599
00:53:48,249 --> 00:53:50,126
Yes?

600
00:53:50,289 --> 00:53:52,644
He didn't know what to say.

601
00:53:53,329 --> 00:53:56,765
I heard of a man once
who was in love with a girl...

602
00:53:56,929 --> 00:53:59,682
...and afraid to say so.

603
00:54:06,809 --> 00:54:08,845
Cugat. I promised to meet him.

604
00:54:09,009 --> 00:54:12,046
I almost forgot. You'll forgive me
if I go, won't you?

605
00:54:12,209 --> 00:54:15,360
- Of course.
- I'm awfully sorry. I promised to see...

606
00:54:16,449 --> 00:54:18,644
Good night.

607
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:23,199
- Why, he's leaving.
- Good.

608
00:54:23,769 --> 00:54:25,805
Mr. Davis.

609
00:54:25,969 --> 00:54:28,324
- Doesn't Maria dance beautifully?
- Yes.

610
00:54:28,489 --> 00:54:30,207
You should've seen her
dressing for you.

611
00:54:30,369 --> 00:54:32,599
No dress was good enough,
even though she has dozens.

612
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:36,159
- Not that she's extravagant, Mr. Davis.
- I'm sure she's not. Good night, girls.

613
00:54:36,329 --> 00:54:38,797
When Mama was away once,
Maria ran the house herself.

614
00:54:38,969 --> 00:54:41,722
- Papa said the bills were cut in half.
- And what meals we had!

615
00:54:41,889 --> 00:54:44,801
- Maria majored in domestic science.
- She did?

616
00:54:44,969 --> 00:54:48,006
Everyone remarks on what
a perfect wife she'll make.

617
00:54:48,169 --> 00:54:50,967
I agree. Absolute...
If I could just have my hat.

618
00:54:51,129 --> 00:54:53,689
- Oh, of course.
- You must forgive the girls...

619
00:54:53,849 --> 00:54:57,046
...they're just anxious for Maria
to get married so they can be married.

620
00:54:57,209 --> 00:55:00,167
- Well, thank you very much...
- They don't need to worry any longer.

621
00:55:00,329 --> 00:55:04,481
- I'd say Maria's falling in love.
- We'd miss her if she left.

622
00:55:04,649 --> 00:55:07,083
We'd be willing to make the sacrifice
for her happiness.

623
00:55:07,249 --> 00:55:09,444
Thanks. It's been so nice.

624
00:55:10,649 --> 00:55:13,209
- Leaving so soon, Mr. Davis?
- Yes.

625
00:55:13,369 --> 00:55:15,087
But I hate to.

626
00:55:15,249 --> 00:55:17,683
- Good night.
- Good night.

627
00:55:17,849 --> 00:55:20,602
- Thanks a lot.
- Oh, you're very welcome.

628
00:55:20,769 --> 00:55:23,044
Will you three stop interfering
with Maria's life?

629
00:55:23,209 --> 00:55:24,961
Will you leave that to me?

630
00:55:25,129 --> 00:55:27,689
- Oh, Maria!
- Oh, Maria!

631
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:30,923
- Isn't he just wonderful?
- How'd you make out?

632
00:55:31,089 --> 00:55:34,126
The first time in my life I ever
really wanted a man to kiss me...

633
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:37,326
...and he had something else to do.

634
00:55:38,129 --> 00:55:40,689
But the next time,
it's going to be different.

635
00:55:42,489 --> 00:55:45,208
Eduardo, did you hear that?

636
00:55:47,529 --> 00:55:49,838
- Hi, Fernie.
- Oh, no. Over my dead body.

637
00:55:50,009 --> 00:55:55,163
- I'm not going to get fired again today.
- Must you clutter up the doorway?

638
00:55:55,729 --> 00:55:58,368
- You betrayed me last night.
- Me? How?

639
00:55:58,529 --> 00:56:01,043
By deliberately concealing
your true and obnoxious nature...

640
00:56:01,209 --> 00:56:03,677
...and making yourself be charming.
- I did not.

641
00:56:03,849 --> 00:56:06,363
Maybe there is insanity
in the female branch of the family.

642
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,565
They've conceived
a misguided affection for you.

643
00:56:08,729 --> 00:56:12,642
- They think I'm in love with Maria.
- The mention of love between you...

644
00:56:12,809 --> 00:56:14,686
...makes my flesh creep.

645
00:56:15,849 --> 00:56:19,000
How you can be the father of such
a lovely girl absolutely amazes me.

646
00:56:19,169 --> 00:56:22,241
- I resent that remark.
- I resent how you butt into her life.

647
00:56:22,409 --> 00:56:24,604
But you have absolutely
no right to resent anything.

648
00:56:24,769 --> 00:56:27,647
Mr. Acuna, I've arranged to fly back
to New York by the next plane.

649
00:56:27,809 --> 00:56:30,448
- You've what?
- You can tear up that contract.

650
00:56:30,609 --> 00:56:33,282
- I've decided to beat it.
- Oh, you have? Just like that?

651
00:56:33,449 --> 00:56:36,600
Yes, sir, I'm going to dump
your entire asinine predicament...

652
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:38,805
...right back into your lap.

653
00:56:38,969 --> 00:56:42,166
Oh, I see. You want them to think
that I forced you to leave.

654
00:56:42,329 --> 00:56:44,126
Isn't that exactly what you're doing?

655
00:56:44,289 --> 00:56:47,804
You want Maria to think you're a
martyr, sacrificed on the altar of love.

656
00:56:48,289 --> 00:56:52,077
That idiotic statement didn't come
from your wife's side of the family.

657
00:56:52,249 --> 00:56:54,683
Mr. Davis, you signed
a binding contract with me.

658
00:56:54,849 --> 00:56:56,840
You'll stay here,
or I'll file an injunction.

659
00:56:57,009 --> 00:56:58,840
- Yesterday, you wanted...
- That was before...

660
00:56:59,009 --> 00:57:02,001
...your hideous display of charm
last night. Now I have a new plan.

661
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:04,399
You will live up to your contract
in the Sky Room...

662
00:57:04,569 --> 00:57:08,198
...but you will keep away from Maria.
- Is that supposed to be brilliant?

663
00:57:08,369 --> 00:57:11,281
That will let her know that you
merely used her to get the contract.

664
00:57:11,449 --> 00:57:13,883
Naturally, then, she will loathe you.

665
00:57:14,049 --> 00:57:16,404
That's just dandy. Then what?

666
00:57:16,769 --> 00:57:18,919
Then, to show you how little
you've meant to her...

667
00:57:19,089 --> 00:57:23,048
...she will immediately fall in love
with a more acceptable young man.

668
00:57:23,209 --> 00:57:26,599
One of many whom I will invite
to my home in the immediate future.

669
00:57:26,769 --> 00:57:30,239
- You think she'll fall in love quickly?
- Mr. Davis...

670
00:57:30,409 --> 00:57:34,482
...I have an instinct about emotional
responses of the feminine heart.

671
00:57:35,809 --> 00:57:38,369
Don't you think
I ought to explain to Maria that...?

672
00:57:38,529 --> 00:57:39,803
No.

673
00:57:40,569 --> 00:57:42,207
- Why, I thought perhaps...
- No.

674
00:57:42,369 --> 00:57:45,918
Our mutual aim
is that she loathe you, isn't it?

675
00:57:46,089 --> 00:57:48,444
I guess so.

676
00:57:51,329 --> 00:57:53,365
- I was just thinking...
- No.

677
00:57:53,529 --> 00:57:56,043
You do the dancing,
I'll do the thinking.

678
00:58:06,809 --> 00:58:10,279
Fernando, in making out the guest list
for the wedding anniversary ball...

679
00:58:10,449 --> 00:58:12,917
<i>... I wanna include the most</i>
<i>outstanding and charming men...</i>

680
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:14,841
<i>... who have ever b</i>ee<i>n guests</i>
<i>in my hom</i>e.

681
00:58:15,009 --> 00:58:16,442
Yes, sir.

682
00:58:16,609 --> 00:58:19,169
Wait a minute!
I thought I discharged you yesterday!

683
00:58:19,569 --> 00:58:24,120
Mrs. Acuna told me to forgive
your display of temper, so I have.

684
00:58:24,289 --> 00:58:26,359
I forgive you, Mr. Acuna.

685
00:58:26,529 --> 00:58:28,281
Oh, thank you very much.

686
00:58:28,449 --> 00:58:31,247
Not at all, sir.
I'll prepare the list.

687
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:35,569
"Mr. And Mrs. Acuna request
the pleasure of your company...

688
00:58:35,729 --> 00:58:38,118
...at the 25th anniversary
of their wedding.

689
00:58:38,289 --> 00:58:40,405
Fancy dress."

690
00:58:40,569 --> 00:58:42,958
I can't believe
it's been 25 years, Delfina.

691
00:58:43,129 --> 00:58:45,723
That's because
you aren't married to Eduardo.

692
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:48,881
I might have been
if you hadn't seen him first.

693
00:58:49,049 --> 00:58:51,119
- Where's Maria?
- Tennis lesson.

694
00:58:51,289 --> 00:58:52,722
But her mind isn't on the ball.

695
00:58:52,889 --> 00:58:57,246
She's still trying to figure out why
Mr. Davis didn't kiss her, I guess.

696
00:58:57,409 --> 00:58:59,559
- Oh, hello, Fernando.
- Good afternoon, Lita...

697
00:58:59,729 --> 00:59:03,517
...Mrs. Acuna, Castro, Cecy.

698
00:59:03,689 --> 00:59:07,284
Mr. Acuna sent me with his approved
list of young men he wishes invited.

699
00:59:07,449 --> 00:59:10,486
- Oh, swell!
- Let me see.

700
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:16,798
I don't see Mr. Davis' name here,
Fernando. Mr. Robert Davis.

701
00:59:16,969 --> 00:59:20,757
It seems that Mr. Robert Davis
is not on Mr. Acuna's approved list.

702
00:59:21,089 --> 00:59:22,841
He's the only one on my list.

703
00:59:23,009 --> 00:59:24,203
- Hello, Aunt Maria.
- Hello.

704
00:59:24,369 --> 00:59:26,519
- Fernando.
- Hello.

705
00:59:26,689 --> 00:59:29,078
Do you know why Papa
left Mr. Davis off the list?

706
00:59:29,249 --> 00:59:32,127
He said something about Mr. Davis
devoting himself to the Sky Room...

707
00:59:32,289 --> 00:59:35,326
...from now, henceforth.
- Thank you, Fernando.

708
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:37,525
You know, we're expecting you
at the celebration.

709
00:59:37,689 --> 00:59:40,920
Thank you, Mrs. Acuna.
You honour me. Sweet.

710
00:59:41,089 --> 00:59:43,080
- Bye.
- Goodbye, Fernando.

711
00:59:43,249 --> 00:59:47,447
I'd be interested in meeting
your Robert Davis, Maria.

712
00:59:47,609 --> 00:59:49,804
Well, I haven't a thing to do
right now.

713
00:59:49,969 --> 00:59:52,927
How nice. Neither have I.

714
00:59:59,649 --> 01:00:01,640
A little faster, Cugie, please.
Once more.

715
01:00:01,809 --> 01:00:03,447
One, two.

716
01:00:09,649 --> 01:00:11,765
Hold it.

717
01:00:17,089 --> 01:00:18,488
Well, hello.

718
01:00:18,649 --> 01:00:21,402
- Does your father know you're here?
- No, why should he?

719
01:00:21,569 --> 01:00:24,129
- Mrs. Castro, may I present...
- Why, I remember you.

720
01:00:24,289 --> 01:00:28,840
- So you're Maria's Robert.
- Yes... Well, I don't know. Am I?

721
01:00:29,009 --> 01:00:30,761
Won't you come in and sit down?

722
01:00:30,929 --> 01:00:33,363
We are special emissaries
from Mr. And Mrs. Acuna.

723
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:36,919
We're asking the pleasure of your
company on Wednesday evening.

724
01:00:37,089 --> 01:00:39,319
- Thank you.
- At 9 p.m., but...

725
01:00:39,489 --> 01:00:42,845
...you can come earlier if you like.

726
01:00:43,009 --> 01:00:45,239
Are you sure Mr. Acuna
wants me to come?

727
01:00:45,409 --> 01:00:48,003
Oh, he'd be devastated if you didn't.

728
01:00:48,169 --> 01:00:49,488
And so would I.

729
01:00:49,649 --> 01:00:53,085
You were coming back
in half an hour, weren't you, Auntie?

730
01:00:55,969 --> 01:00:59,757
Oh, yes, in a half an hour. Goodbye.

731
01:01:02,449 --> 01:01:05,566
Won't you sit down?

732
01:01:08,929 --> 01:01:12,319
Well, this is a pleasant surprise.

733
01:01:12,489 --> 01:01:15,128
We were just running over
a little thing from Harlem.

734
01:01:15,289 --> 01:01:17,405
But I don't suppose
you've heard of Harlem here.

735
01:01:17,569 --> 01:01:20,402
Isn't that where the zoot suit
with the reet pleat comes from?

736
01:01:22,849 --> 01:01:24,248
Yeah.

737
01:01:24,409 --> 01:01:27,082
- I'd like to hear it. May I?
- Certainly.

738
01:01:27,249 --> 01:01:28,682
Oh, Cugie, let's have it.

739
01:05:34,049 --> 01:05:35,607
Are you sure he's coming?

740
01:05:36,489 --> 01:05:37,842
Does Papa know?

741
01:05:38,529 --> 01:05:40,281
Do you think he'll propose tonight?

742
01:05:40,449 --> 01:05:43,043
Well, if he doesn't,
it won't be my fault.

743
01:05:44,129 --> 01:05:45,562
Maria!

744
01:05:53,769 --> 01:05:55,919
My, isn't Papa handsome?

745
01:05:56,089 --> 01:05:59,286
Just think, Papa, you've been
married longer than we've lived.

746
01:05:59,449 --> 01:06:02,919
Well, I consider that a very fortunate
coincidence, my dear.

747
01:06:04,169 --> 01:06:05,602
Maria.

748
01:06:06,289 --> 01:06:08,849
It just occurred to me
that I neglected to ask Mr. Davis...

749
01:06:09,009 --> 01:06:12,126
...to come to the house tonight.
That doesn't bother you, does it?

750
01:06:12,289 --> 01:06:14,723
- Should it, Papa?
- It's just, I thought it unforgivable...

751
01:06:14,889 --> 01:06:17,722
...that he didn't call on you
after starting his contract with me.

752
01:06:17,889 --> 01:06:20,039
He hasn't sent
any more orchids, has he?

753
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:22,006
- No more notes?
- Nope.

754
01:06:22,169 --> 01:06:24,046
- You don't seem upset about it.
- I'm not.

755
01:06:24,209 --> 01:06:25,403
Well, that's fine.

756
01:06:25,569 --> 01:06:27,605
There'll be some handsome
young men tonight.

757
01:06:27,769 --> 01:06:29,327
I want you to have a happy time.

758
01:06:29,489 --> 01:06:31,764
I expect this to be
the happiest night of my life.

759
01:06:31,929 --> 01:06:35,478
That's a good girl. I knew you'd let Mr.
Davis know exactly where he stands.

760
01:06:35,649 --> 01:06:38,288
Yes, Papa,
that's just what I intend to do.

761
01:06:38,449 --> 01:06:40,565
Papa, Grandma's here. Hurry!

762
01:06:48,529 --> 01:06:51,202
Thank you very much.
Very kind of you.

763
01:06:52,969 --> 01:06:55,927
- Congratulations.
- Oh, Maria.

764
01:07:03,369 --> 01:07:05,519
What's going on between
your wife and my husband?

765
01:07:05,689 --> 01:07:07,805
They're always whispering.

766
01:07:07,969 --> 01:07:10,164
This is a fine time
to suspect your husband...

767
01:07:10,329 --> 01:07:11,648
...on your wedding anniversary.

768
01:07:12,569 --> 01:07:14,287
Well, I don't know.

769
01:07:16,809 --> 01:07:20,358
You're such a fool,
and you think you're so smart.

770
01:07:20,529 --> 01:07:22,008
Why, Maria actually
seemed happy...

771
01:07:22,169 --> 01:07:24,967
...when I told her
I hadn't invited Mr. Davis.

772
01:07:31,849 --> 01:07:33,077
Robert.

773
01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:35,319
- Oh, Mr. Davis.
- We're so glad to see you.

774
01:07:35,489 --> 01:07:37,127
Thank you.
Congratulations, Mrs. Acuna.

775
01:07:37,289 --> 01:07:40,520
- It's so nice of you to ask me.
- We're happy to have you, aren't we?

776
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:43,249
- Delighted. Aren't we, Papa?
- Yes, indeed.

777
01:07:43,409 --> 01:07:44,762
Congratulations, Mr. Acuna.

778
01:07:44,929 --> 01:07:47,318
It gives us all an opportunity
to say goodbye to him.

779
01:07:47,489 --> 01:07:48,638
- Goodbye?
- Goodbye?

780
01:07:48,809 --> 01:07:51,448
He received an offer from New York,
didn't you, Robert?

781
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:54,487
- Well, that is...
- Insisted on taking tomorrow's plane.

782
01:07:54,649 --> 01:07:56,321
Didn't you, Robert?

783
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:57,683
Yes, I guess I did.

784
01:07:57,849 --> 01:08:00,283
- Oh, Mr. Davis, you can't!
- We won't let you!

785
01:08:00,449 --> 01:08:03,486
I'm sure Mr. Davis
knows what's best.

786
01:08:03,649 --> 01:08:06,766
- For him.
- You must induce him to stay.

787
01:08:06,929 --> 01:08:09,648
I have no alternative. He asked me
to tear up the contract.

788
01:08:09,809 --> 01:08:13,006
- Didn't you, Robert?
- Yes, sir.

789
01:08:13,809 --> 01:08:15,640
Grandma wanted to meet you.

790
01:08:27,849 --> 01:08:30,841
- Isn't she a lovely girl?
- I've never met a lovelier one.

791
01:08:31,009 --> 01:08:32,840
Remember, I have
my own chapel at home...

792
01:08:33,009 --> 01:08:35,603
...if you'd like to get married
without the usual Acuna fuss.

793
01:08:35,769 --> 01:08:37,202
Granny, we...

794
01:08:37,369 --> 01:08:40,247
You don't understand.
We have no use for a chapel.

795
01:08:40,409 --> 01:08:44,288
We've just heard that Mr. Davis
is forced to leave us.

796
01:08:44,609 --> 01:08:47,885
You chose exactly
the right word, Maria.

797
01:08:49,969 --> 01:08:54,520
Our dear friends, 52 years ago
in a little village in Brittany...

798
01:08:54,689 --> 01:08:56,759
...my beloved mother
and father were married.

799
01:08:56,929 --> 01:08:59,238
When they came to South America
they brought a song...

800
01:08:59,409 --> 01:09:00,922
...and a happy tradition with them.

801
01:09:01,089 --> 01:09:03,205
This music was played
at their wedding...

802
01:09:03,369 --> 01:09:05,644
...and 25 years ago,
at Delfina's and mine.

803
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:08,039
And now, in honour
of my beloved mother...

804
01:09:08,209 --> 01:09:09,927
...and in tribute
to my charming wife...

805
01:09:10,089 --> 01:09:12,649
...I have asked Mr. Cugat
to play that music for us tonight.

806
01:11:57,129 --> 01:12:00,599
Hey, you've got to make Davis
so jealous that he won't leave Maria.

807
01:12:00,769 --> 01:12:03,237
If he takes a plane,
it's gotta be on a honeymoon with her.

808
01:12:03,409 --> 01:12:04,967
Will you do it?

809
01:12:05,129 --> 01:12:07,597
Well, well,
what are you waiting for?

810
01:12:19,529 --> 01:12:23,363
Listen, old man, I started this dance
with Maria, and I'm going to finish it.

811
01:12:35,129 --> 01:12:36,448
Go out there and cut in on him.

812
01:12:36,609 --> 01:12:39,646
Keep after him until he's so jealous
he can't stand it.

813
01:12:54,569 --> 01:12:56,002
Help!

814
01:13:01,569 --> 01:13:04,641
Mr. Davis, how dare you
attack a guest of mine!

815
01:13:04,809 --> 01:13:07,482
- The jester was getting out of hand.
- And getting in my hair.

816
01:13:07,649 --> 01:13:11,688
- I will not tolerate this sort of thing.
- It was our fault, we egged him on.

817
01:13:11,849 --> 01:13:13,680
But falling in the pool
was his own fault!

818
01:13:14,369 --> 01:13:17,406
Everything that happens
in the Acuna family is my fault.

819
01:13:17,569 --> 01:13:21,039
I work long hours, I do as I'm told,
and where does it get me?

820
01:13:21,209 --> 01:13:22,358
In the end?

821
01:13:22,529 --> 01:13:26,363
Oh, so it's you!
You chose your costume well, fool!

822
01:13:26,529 --> 01:13:28,440
Mr. Acuna, I have stood enough.

823
01:13:28,609 --> 01:13:30,964
Fernando, I didn't know.
I guess it was partly my fault.

824
01:13:31,129 --> 01:13:34,405
It's not your fault I'm distantly related
to this fuddy-duddy by marriage.

825
01:13:34,569 --> 01:13:36,878
- What was that again?
- You will bark at me no longer!

826
01:13:37,049 --> 01:13:39,722
I resign, and don't take advantage
of our family connections...

827
01:13:39,889 --> 01:13:43,165
...to try to get me back again.
Fuddy-duddy.

828
01:13:44,769 --> 01:13:48,125
Oh, let's tell the truth.
We were trying to help ourselves.

829
01:13:48,289 --> 01:13:50,200
We're sick and tired
of being old maids.

830
01:13:50,369 --> 01:13:52,166
We wanted
to make Robert jealous...

831
01:13:52,329 --> 01:13:54,524
...so that he'd propose to Maria
before he left.

832
01:13:54,689 --> 01:13:57,442
- You're wasting your time.
- Well, why?

833
01:13:57,609 --> 01:14:01,238
Because I'm not in love with Robert
and he's not in love with me.

834
01:14:01,929 --> 01:14:04,397
I think we've embarrassed
him enough.

835
01:14:09,329 --> 01:14:10,842
Don't let it upset you, Robert.

836
01:14:11,009 --> 01:14:14,240
Maria was bound to come
to her senses sooner or later.

837
01:14:14,489 --> 01:14:16,605
Kind of settles your problems,
doesn't it?

838
01:14:17,569 --> 01:14:19,321
Would you mind
if I said goodbye to her?

839
01:14:19,489 --> 01:14:21,445
Not at all, not at all.

840
01:14:21,649 --> 01:14:23,082
Thanks.

841
01:14:23,649 --> 01:14:25,082
Maria.

842
01:14:25,609 --> 01:14:27,361
Why did you say that
to Robert out there?

843
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:28,803
What else could I say?

844
01:14:28,969 --> 01:14:31,961
Everybody's trying to push him into
marrying me. Even Granny tried it.

845
01:14:32,129 --> 01:14:34,324
If you ask me,
I don't think he needs any pushing.

846
01:14:34,489 --> 01:14:35,922
Maria.

847
01:14:36,289 --> 01:14:38,359
There's something I've got to say.

848
01:14:38,529 --> 01:14:42,363
Take her in the garden.
You can say it much better out there.

849
01:14:43,609 --> 01:14:46,806
The air's nice out there, remember?

850
01:14:56,089 --> 01:14:58,000
I just wanted to say that...

851
01:15:00,449 --> 01:15:02,644
Gee, you're beautiful.

852
01:15:04,089 --> 01:15:05,488
It's funny, I had so much to say.

853
01:15:05,649 --> 01:15:08,288
And now I can't think
of a darned thing.

854
01:15:12,729 --> 01:15:13,923
Where was I?

855
01:15:14,609 --> 01:15:17,077
You said I was beautiful.

856
01:15:18,169 --> 01:15:20,239
Oh, yes, I did.

857
01:15:22,369 --> 01:15:26,726
Look, would you mind turning
the other way, please?

858
01:15:27,009 --> 01:15:28,362
Why?

859
01:15:29,409 --> 01:15:32,640
I can't concentrate
when you look at me like that.

860
01:15:38,849 --> 01:15:40,805
I was only kidding.

861
01:15:42,049 --> 01:15:44,199
Oh, you're terrific!

862
01:15:47,969 --> 01:15:50,039
What's the use?

863
01:17:20,889 --> 01:17:23,483
Is that what you wanted
to say, Robert?

864
01:17:23,649 --> 01:17:25,719
Well, that's only the first part.

865
01:17:25,889 --> 01:17:28,164
I don't quite know how
to tell you the rest.

866
01:17:28,329 --> 01:17:31,958
Well, maybe I can make
it easy for you.

867
01:17:32,169 --> 01:17:34,160
I love you too.

868
01:17:37,569 --> 01:17:40,766
Oh, doctor, you've struck a nerve!

869
01:17:47,209 --> 01:17:50,565
Well, Robert,
did you say goodbye?

870
01:17:50,729 --> 01:17:53,641
Not exactly.
It was more like hello.

871
01:17:53,809 --> 01:17:56,164
I can never say goodbye
to her, sir.

872
01:17:56,329 --> 01:17:57,967
- I love Maria.
- You don't say.

873
01:17:58,129 --> 01:17:59,721
Well, that's just too bad.

874
01:17:59,889 --> 01:18:01,481
It would be
if she didn't love me too.

875
01:18:01,649 --> 01:18:03,685
That's poppycock.
You heard what she said.

876
01:18:03,849 --> 01:18:06,568
Yep, I was there. You weren't.

877
01:18:06,729 --> 01:18:10,688
- You're leaving on tomorrow's plane.
- Yeah, but with Maria.

878
01:18:10,849 --> 01:18:13,238
You'll do nothing of the kind!

879
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:16,203
Sit down, Robert, sit down.

880
01:18:18,529 --> 01:18:21,407
This is going to hurt you,
and I admit, I'm sorry for you.

881
01:18:21,569 --> 01:18:24,800
Maria isn't in love with you.
She merely thinks she is.

882
01:18:24,969 --> 01:18:26,197
That's good enough for me.

883
01:18:26,369 --> 01:18:28,803
- How will she feel when she finds out?
- Finds out what?

884
01:18:28,969 --> 01:18:30,561
That you weren't
her unknown admirer?

885
01:18:30,729 --> 01:18:34,039
That you agreed to deceive her
in exchange for a contract?

886
01:18:34,929 --> 01:18:36,840
Well, that's not a very pretty way
to put it.

887
01:18:37,009 --> 01:18:39,443
A woman doesn't mind you lying
when you compliment her...

888
01:18:39,609 --> 01:18:42,407
...but she'd never forgive a lie
that made her a moonstruck ninny.

889
01:18:42,569 --> 01:18:45,959
She's not. And I haven't been
exactly lying to her.

890
01:18:46,129 --> 01:18:47,767
Besides, you got me into this.

891
01:18:47,929 --> 01:18:51,478
Did you know that Maria
found a romantic ideal at 15?

892
01:18:51,649 --> 01:18:53,162
- No.
- She did.

893
01:18:53,329 --> 01:18:55,684
His name was Lochinvar.

894
01:18:56,289 --> 01:18:58,280
You don't mean that fellow
on a white horse?

895
01:18:58,449 --> 01:18:59,643
A sort of knight?

896
01:18:59,809 --> 01:19:01,879
She cherished a dream
that she'd meet a man...

897
01:19:02,049 --> 01:19:04,483
...that measured up to that ideal.
- I don't believe that.

898
01:19:04,649 --> 01:19:05,968
She's a big girl now.

899
01:19:06,129 --> 01:19:08,085
Have you taken a good look
at her lately?

900
01:19:08,249 --> 01:19:10,524
At heart, she's still the same
romantic girl.

901
01:19:11,329 --> 01:19:14,401
You were just an accident, my boy.
It might have been anybody.

902
01:19:14,569 --> 01:19:16,844
Any man who arrived
when she was ready and waiting...

903
01:19:17,009 --> 01:19:20,126
...for the lover who intrigued her,
who brought her orchids.

904
01:19:20,289 --> 01:19:23,440
There'd come a day when
the illusion I created would vanish.

905
01:19:23,609 --> 01:19:26,760
Suddenly, she'd see you
as you really are.

906
01:19:27,009 --> 01:19:29,159
And that's...? That's bad, huh?

907
01:19:29,329 --> 01:19:31,968
For Maria, yes.

908
01:19:32,609 --> 01:19:34,201
Yeah.

909
01:19:36,809 --> 01:19:38,037
I'm sorry.

910
01:19:38,209 --> 01:19:41,679
I try to appear hard,
but I'm a fake, Robert.

911
01:19:41,849 --> 01:19:43,567
At heart, I'm a sentimentalist.

912
01:19:43,729 --> 01:19:45,526
I pity you, but I love my daughter.

913
01:19:45,689 --> 01:19:48,078
I want to see her happy.
Don't you?

914
01:19:48,249 --> 01:19:50,205
Of course I do.

915
01:19:51,009 --> 01:19:53,807
If I go north, will you promise
that she'll never know...

916
01:19:53,969 --> 01:19:57,598
...that I didn't send the notes?
- I give you my word.

917
01:19:57,769 --> 01:20:00,237
It's just that I want her
to remember me...

918
01:20:00,409 --> 01:20:01,728
...as she thinks I am.

919
01:20:01,889 --> 01:20:03,163
I'll let her keep her memories.

920
01:20:03,329 --> 01:20:05,718
As a matter of fact,
I'll compose a farewell note...

921
01:20:05,889 --> 01:20:08,608
...that she'll treasure
as long as she lives.

922
01:20:09,889 --> 01:20:11,800
It's best that I don't see her again.

923
01:20:11,969 --> 01:20:13,800
I wouldn't know what to say.

924
01:20:13,969 --> 01:20:17,041
I'll say it.
I'll break it gently.

925
01:20:17,209 --> 01:20:19,006
Thank you, sir.

926
01:20:26,969 --> 01:20:29,244
We're awfully sorry, Fernando.

927
01:20:29,409 --> 01:20:31,001
We didn't mean to get you in trouble.

928
01:20:31,169 --> 01:20:34,718
I'm going to insist that Eduardo
ignore his resignation.

929
01:20:35,209 --> 01:20:36,437
Oh, Mama.

930
01:20:36,609 --> 01:20:39,077
While you're there, will you
put in a good word for Robert?

931
01:20:39,249 --> 01:20:41,399
Of course, dear.

932
01:20:44,129 --> 01:20:45,562
"Dearly beloved...

933
01:20:45,729 --> 01:20:49,165
...as long as my heart beats, I'll never
forget the softness of your lips...

934
01:20:49,329 --> 01:20:51,285
...the pounding of your heart
against mine.

935
01:20:51,449 --> 01:20:53,360
Yes, my dearest, darling Maria...

936
01:20:53,529 --> 01:20:57,363
...I will always cherish the exquisite
torture of our stolen kisses...

937
01:20:57,729 --> 01:20:59,720
...our sweet stolen moments together.

938
01:20:59,889 --> 01:21:03,768
- Maria, my secret love."
- Maria?

939
01:21:04,209 --> 01:21:06,962
You and Maria Castro!

940
01:21:07,129 --> 01:21:09,245
Now I know what all that
whispering's been about.

941
01:21:09,409 --> 01:21:13,322
- You bluebeard!
- Delfina, give me that note.

942
01:21:13,489 --> 01:21:17,402
The "softness" of her...
The "pounding" of her...

943
01:21:17,569 --> 01:21:20,879
To think that you,
lovemaking with Maria.

944
01:21:21,049 --> 01:21:23,005
The godmother of your own child.

945
01:21:23,209 --> 01:21:25,086
The wife of your best friend.

946
01:21:25,249 --> 01:21:28,127
Writing a love note to her
on our own wedding anniversary.

947
01:21:28,289 --> 01:21:30,359
- You wretch!
- Delfina, I can ex...

948
01:21:30,529 --> 01:21:32,759
Don't try to change the subject.
Say something!

949
01:21:32,929 --> 01:21:34,681
Delfina, give me that note!

950
01:21:34,849 --> 01:21:37,966
I regret having to say goodbye,
Mrs. Castro. You've been most kind.

951
01:21:38,129 --> 01:21:40,040
You'd better go into the library,
Mrs. Castro.

952
01:21:40,209 --> 01:21:42,404
- Your name is being bandied about.
- What's that?

953
01:21:42,569 --> 01:21:45,037
The pistols are on the table.

954
01:21:46,129 --> 01:21:49,041
Retribution day is here. Acuna's
going to get what's coming to him.

955
01:21:49,209 --> 01:21:51,245
- How? Why?
- He was caught red-handed...

956
01:21:51,409 --> 01:21:54,207
...writing a love note to Maria Castro.

957
01:21:54,529 --> 01:21:55,962
Maria Castro?

958
01:21:56,129 --> 01:22:00,441
- I'm innocent, I tell you.
- Don't touch me, you scorpion.

959
01:22:00,769 --> 01:22:03,886
Oh, Juan, we'll have to bear
this disgrace together.

960
01:22:04,049 --> 01:22:06,119
And we have grown children.

961
01:22:06,289 --> 01:22:08,928
This letter was written to your wife
by my husband.

962
01:22:09,089 --> 01:22:11,319
Let the reptile's own words
convict him.

963
01:22:11,489 --> 01:22:13,844
We caught him writing it.
He jumped like he was shot.

964
01:22:14,009 --> 01:22:15,488
- Did he admit it?
- I admit nothing.

965
01:22:15,649 --> 01:22:17,719
You keep out of this!
I'm talking to your wife.

966
01:22:17,889 --> 01:22:20,357
I gave him the best 25 years of my life.

967
01:22:20,529 --> 01:22:22,087
Do you deny you wrote this note?

968
01:22:22,249 --> 01:22:24,444
I ask that my daughters
leave this ridiculous scene.

969
01:22:24,609 --> 01:22:26,281
And I demand that they stay.

970
01:22:26,449 --> 01:22:30,442
They'll learn a lesson in matrimony
they'll never forget.

971
01:22:30,689 --> 01:22:33,522
Eduardo, I am a jealous man.

972
01:22:33,689 --> 01:22:36,726
Will you please take that injured look
from your fat face?

973
01:22:37,249 --> 01:22:39,365
- Did you write this note?
- Yes, I wrote the note...

974
01:22:39,529 --> 01:22:42,999
I'm sure that Papa can explain
everything if you'll just give him time.

975
01:22:43,169 --> 01:22:47,560
- Yes, if you'll just give me time.
- Well, we're listening.

976
01:22:48,289 --> 01:22:49,881
Well, this isn't the time.

977
01:22:50,049 --> 01:22:52,279
And what have you to say,
you brazen thing?

978
01:22:52,449 --> 01:22:55,759
My dear, sweet, darling wife,
will you please shut up?

979
01:22:55,969 --> 01:22:58,688
I'm not speaking to her again anyway.

980
01:22:58,849 --> 01:23:01,841
If you wanted my husband, why didn't
you come to me and ask for him?

981
01:23:02,009 --> 01:23:03,328
I don't want your husband.

982
01:23:03,489 --> 01:23:05,639
There she goes,
laughing at me behind my back.

983
01:23:05,809 --> 01:23:07,640
Beg pardon, Delfina, right in your face.

984
01:23:07,809 --> 01:23:10,039
Oh, whispering women!

985
01:23:10,209 --> 01:23:14,122
Going to his office every day,
and him, writing letters!

986
01:23:14,289 --> 01:23:16,120
- He's a fiend.
- You don't know...

987
01:23:16,289 --> 01:23:18,166
...what you're talking about.
- Don't argue!

988
01:23:18,329 --> 01:23:20,763
If Delfina says he's a fiend,
he's a fiend.

989
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:23,727
- They're insane, Maria, both of them.
- I am insane, Eduardo.

990
01:23:23,889 --> 01:23:27,040
It's an insane world when
my best friend and my own wife...

991
01:23:27,209 --> 01:23:29,803
Eduardo, we must confess.

992
01:23:29,969 --> 01:23:32,244
Did you hear her?
She wants to confess.

993
01:23:32,409 --> 01:23:35,401
We'll confess nothing.
Not here and not now.

994
01:23:35,569 --> 01:23:39,642
- You'll have to be patient.
- I'll have to be patient?!

995
01:23:40,129 --> 01:23:42,597
Hold that gun.
It might go off, you know.

996
01:23:42,769 --> 01:23:44,680
Now, look, I can explain everything.

997
01:23:44,849 --> 01:23:47,682
Mr. Acuna was not writing that letter
to Maria Castro.

998
01:23:47,849 --> 01:23:50,522
He was writing it to Maria,
his own daughter...

999
01:23:51,169 --> 01:23:54,206
...as a farewell note from me.
- From you?

1000
01:23:56,969 --> 01:24:01,247
He wrote all the notes you received,
and he sent all the orchids.

1001
01:24:01,409 --> 01:24:03,047
I don't understand.

1002
01:24:03,209 --> 01:24:06,121
He just decided that Maria
should have an unknown suitor, so...

1003
01:24:06,289 --> 01:24:09,008
Is that true, Eduardo?

1004
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:11,808
You were very considerate, Papa.

1005
01:24:12,249 --> 01:24:15,559
But how did you come into all this?

1006
01:24:16,329 --> 01:24:20,004
When I delivered the orchids, Maria,
you jumped at conclusions.

1007
01:24:20,169 --> 01:24:24,128
So your father had to ask me
to act as your admirer.

1008
01:24:27,009 --> 01:24:30,922
Well, how did you bring yourself
to make such a sacrifice?

1009
01:24:31,089 --> 01:24:32,920
The truth is, I wanted this contract...

1010
01:24:33,089 --> 01:24:36,365
And that's how Papa paid you
for being attentive to me.

1011
01:24:36,529 --> 01:24:39,248
- In a way, but later...
- Later you got tired of the assignment.

1012
01:24:39,409 --> 01:24:41,001
You got in too deep.

1013
01:24:41,169 --> 01:24:44,878
So Papa wrote a goodbye note
for you to send.

1014
01:24:46,009 --> 01:24:49,684
I apologize for all the embarrassment
this has caused you, Aunt Maria.

1015
01:24:49,849 --> 01:24:51,840
It was partly my fault.

1016
01:24:52,009 --> 01:24:55,160
I knew your father
was writing the notes.

1017
01:24:57,249 --> 01:25:00,924
Well! Everybody knows now.

1018
01:25:01,089 --> 01:25:03,603
I guess nobody had
any way of knowing...

1019
01:25:03,769 --> 01:25:07,159
...l'd make such
a complete fool of myself.

1020
01:25:07,809 --> 01:25:09,561
Congratulations, Robert.

1021
01:25:09,729 --> 01:25:13,881
I hope Papa paid you well.
You earned it.

1022
01:25:14,049 --> 01:25:15,641
If I had written the notes...

1023
01:25:15,809 --> 01:25:19,165
...I would have meant every word
your father said.

1024
01:25:20,209 --> 01:25:21,961
Please, Maria.

1025
01:25:22,129 --> 01:25:24,848
He's working overtime, Papa.

1026
01:25:25,089 --> 01:25:27,478
You should give him a bonus.

1027
01:25:42,009 --> 01:25:43,647
Will you ever forgive me, Maria?

1028
01:25:43,809 --> 01:25:47,324
She may, but all my life, I'll be
haunted by your frightful suspicions...

1029
01:25:47,489 --> 01:25:50,242
...that I could have been unfaithful.
- Oh, Eduardo!

1030
01:25:50,409 --> 01:25:54,482
Go and see that our guests are happy
and leave me with my conscience.

1031
01:25:55,129 --> 01:25:56,960
- Eduardo...
- Don't say anything.

1032
01:25:57,129 --> 01:25:59,165
I know, you're a jealous man.

1033
01:25:59,329 --> 01:26:03,163
- Remember, I warned you.
- I remember.

1034
01:26:08,729 --> 01:26:11,687
My boy, a woman's advice
isn't worth listening to...

1035
01:26:11,889 --> 01:26:15,325
...but any man who doesn't take it
is a fool. And that's me.

1036
01:26:15,489 --> 01:26:18,322
I've been pretty much of a dope
myself.

1037
01:26:19,849 --> 01:26:21,805
For some time,
it was a positive pleasure...

1038
01:26:21,969 --> 01:26:23,641
...for me to dislike you.

1039
01:26:23,809 --> 01:26:26,084
It gave me a nice, warm glow.

1040
01:26:26,249 --> 01:26:29,286
But now I must confess that I've
conceived quite a fondness for you.

1041
01:26:29,449 --> 01:26:31,565
What you just did smacked of nobility.

1042
01:26:31,729 --> 01:26:33,845
I didn't want to see you
shot full of holes.

1043
01:26:34,009 --> 01:26:36,443
Making that confession before Maria,
to save me...

1044
01:26:36,609 --> 01:26:40,045
...it must have been painful.
- It wasn't any fun.

1045
01:26:40,209 --> 01:26:42,643
Do you think she'll be all right now?

1046
01:26:42,809 --> 01:26:44,208
Thanks to my meddling, no.

1047
01:26:44,369 --> 01:26:46,599
I wonder if she'll ever forgive us.

1048
01:26:46,769 --> 01:26:51,001
Mr. Acuna, would you mind very much
if I didn't take tomorrow's plane?

1049
01:26:51,169 --> 01:26:52,807
You have my permission
to court Maria...

1050
01:26:52,969 --> 01:26:54,687
...as long as your strength holds out.

1051
01:26:54,849 --> 01:26:56,567
But I'm afraid it won't
do you any good.

1052
01:27:14,369 --> 01:27:17,247
If these orchids aren't out of here
by the time I get back, I'll...

1053
01:27:17,409 --> 01:27:18,842
I'll set fire to them.

1054
01:27:19,009 --> 01:27:21,648
Oh, Miss Maria, can't you see
how desperate he is?

1055
01:27:21,809 --> 01:27:24,277
All right. He made love to you
under false pretences...

1056
01:27:24,449 --> 01:27:26,963
...but he's serious now.

1057
01:27:28,809 --> 01:27:30,879
You've forgiven me.
You can forgive him.

1058
01:27:31,049 --> 01:27:33,438
I can't forgive him for what he did
to make me love him.

1059
01:27:33,609 --> 01:27:36,407
What about the things you did
to make him fall in love with you?

1060
01:27:36,569 --> 01:27:39,561
When you've got a fish hooked,
haul him in.

1061
01:27:46,889 --> 01:27:49,244
Don't you let another orchid
in this house!

1062
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:53,568
- Miss Maria Acuna.
- Right this way, boys.

1063
01:28:45,689 --> 01:28:47,759
Now, don't give up, my boy.

1064
01:28:47,929 --> 01:28:49,840
You're bucking the man
she thought you were.

1065
01:28:50,009 --> 01:28:52,000
- That fellow on the white horse?
- Yes.

1066
01:28:52,169 --> 01:28:54,842
- I have an instinct for...
- For what goes on in a woman's heart.

1067
01:28:55,009 --> 01:28:56,362
- I know.
- I know this.

1068
01:28:56,529 --> 01:28:59,965
Every woman wants to be swept
off her feet and carried away.

1069
01:29:00,169 --> 01:29:03,639
Tell me, just what did this bird
Lochinvar do about his gal?

1070
01:29:03,809 --> 01:29:05,879
Well, he put on his best
suit of Sunday armour...

1071
01:29:06,049 --> 01:29:08,802
...and rode up to her father's castle,
or whatever they lived in.

1072
01:29:08,969 --> 01:29:11,688
There was a dance going on,
or something...

1073
01:29:11,849 --> 01:29:15,125
...but Lochinvar rode into the patio,
or whatever they have in Scotland...

1074
01:29:15,289 --> 01:29:18,520
...and swept the girl off her feet,
onto his horse and rode off with her.

1075
01:29:18,689 --> 01:29:20,361
I think.

1076
01:29:21,009 --> 01:29:23,967
Well, I've tried everything else.

1077
01:31:30,689 --> 01:31:33,965
Robert! Robert!

1078
01:31:34,969 --> 01:31:36,925
Wait, Robert!

1079
01:31:41,209 --> 01:31:43,882
Before we go any further,
I've got to get something straight.

1080
01:31:44,049 --> 01:31:45,528
This Lochinvar fellow.

1081
01:31:45,689 --> 01:31:48,283
Lochinvar?
Never heard of him.

1082
01:31:48,449 --> 01:31:51,168
Darling!
That's all I wanted to know.

1083
01:33:17,089 --> 01:33:18,078
