00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,803
WHAT A CRASH!

100
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,305
LET'S GET HIM
ON HIS FEET.

101
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,307
OSCAR, YOU O.K.?

102
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,309
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

103
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,813
ALL RIGHT?
LET'S DO IT AGAIN!

104
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,314
I AM SO GLAD.

105
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:40,319
I WANT EVERYBODY TO BE HAPPY
ON CHRISTMAS EVE.

106
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,321
TONIGHT SANTA CLAUS COMES.

107
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:50,329
HE TAKES HIS BIG BAG OF TOYS
AND SLIDES DOWN THE CHIMNEY!

108
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,331
OH, COME ON.

109
00:08:52,832 --> 00:09:01,340
DO YOU KNOW HOW BIG
THE INSIDE OF A CHIMNEY IS?

110
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,843
ABOUT THIS BIG!

111
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:07,847
SANTA IS BUILT
LIKE A DUMP TRUCK.

112
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:13,853
HOW WILL HE COME DOWN
THOSE SKINNY, LITTLE CHIMNEYS?

113
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:17,857
HE HOLDS HIS BREATH
LIKE THIS.

114
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,860
THAT'S LIKE TRYING
TO GET A BASKETBALL

115
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,863
INTO A GINGER ALE BOTTLE!

116
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,365
HE COMES IN THE WINDOW.

117
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,366
LOCKED.

118
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:28,868
THE DOOR?

119
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:29,869
LOCKED.

120
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,871
THE OLD INCINERATOR SHAFT.

121
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:35,374
NO! IT'S THE CHIMNEY
OR NOTHING.

122
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:39,378
I DON'T KNOW
HOW SANTA GETS IN.

123
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:43,382
IF I WAS YOU,
I WOULD FIND OUT.

124
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,885
IF HE DOES NOT GET IN,

125
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:50,389
THERE WILL BE A LOT
OF EMPTY STOCKINGS TOMORROW.

126
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,892

132
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:10,910
I DON'T KNOW HOW SANTA
COMES DOWN THE CHIMNEY,

133
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,413
BUT WE WILL FIND OUT.
HUH, PATTY?

134
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:14,413
BUT WE WILL FIND OUT.
HUH, PATTY?

135
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,924

HEY, OSCAR, WAIT!

179
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,084
I KNOW HOW SANTA
GETS DOWN THE CHIMNEY.

180
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:09,588
HE TIES HIS BIG BELT
TIGHT AROUND HIS WASTE.

181
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:14,593
IT MAKES HIM SO SKINNY,
HE FITS DOWN THE CHIMNEY.

182
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:18,597
YOU ARE WITHOUT A DOUBT 
THE STUPIDEST...

183
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:21,600
[TRAIN ROARING BY]

184
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:21,600
[TRAIN ROARING BY]

185
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,107
BIRD I EVER MET.

186
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:28,607
BIRD I EVER MET.

187
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:40,119
## BUT THE GREATEST WONDER
OF THEM ALL ##

188
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:44,623
## IS NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING
AROUND YOU ##

189
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:51,130
## IT'S THE WAY
YOU START TO BE ##

190
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,134
## YES, THE GREATEST WONDER
OF THEM ALL ##

191
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:58,637
## IS HOW YOUR HEART
IS FILLED WITH LOVE ##

192
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:06,645
## YOU START TO LIGHT UP
LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE ##

193
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:09,648
OSCAR, SANTA COVERS
HIMSELF WITH BUTTER

194
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:13,652
SO HE CAN SLIP
RIGHT DOWN THE CHIMNEY.

195
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:13,652
SO HE CAN SLIP
RIGHT DOWN THE CHIMNEY.

196
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,156
DING-DONG,
YOU'RE WRONG.

197
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:20,659
I DON'T THINK
THERE IS A WAY

198
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,662
HE CAN GET DOWN THE CHIMNEY.

199
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:25,664
AND IF HE DOESN'T,

200
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:29,168
NO YOU-KNOW-WHATS
TOMORROW MORNING.

201
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:29,168
NO YOU-KNOW-WHATS
TOMORROW MORNING.

202
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:33,672
## FEELINGS
FEEL SO WONDERFUL ##

203
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:37,676
## YOU HAVE TO
LET THEM SHOW ##

204
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:41,180
## MAYBE THAT'S WHY
EVERYONE ##

205
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,682
## BEGINS TO GET
A GLOW ##

206
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:48,687
## AND FILL THEIR HEARTS
WITH CHRISTMAS ##

207
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,190
## SPIRIT THEY CAN SHARE ##

208
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:56,695
## THAT'S THE BEST PART
OF CHRISTMAS ##

209
00:14:56,695 --> 00:15:00,199
## AND IF THAT ISN'T
A TRUE BLUE MIRACLE ##

210
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:04,203
## I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ONE IS ##

211
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:08,207
## AND IF THAT ISN'T
A TRUE BLUE MIRACLE ##

212
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:11,210
## I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ONE IS ####

213
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:11,210
## I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ONE IS ####

214
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,214
HI, BIG BIRD.

215
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,715
HI, PATTY.

216
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:19,218
HOW WAS
THE SKATING PARTY?

217
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,719
OH, O.K.

218
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:22,721
JUST O.K.?
WHAT'S WRONG?

219
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:25,724
EVERYTHING WAS O.K.
UNTIL OSCAR STARTED...

220
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:30,229
"HOW DOES SANTA CLAUS
GET DOWN THOSE SKINNY CHIMNEYS

221
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,730
WHEN HE'S SO FAT?"

222
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,233
WE HAVE TO FIND OUT.

223
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:38,737
"IF HE CAN'T GET DOWN,
NO ONE WILL GET PRESENTS!"

224
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:41,240
THAT'S WHAT OSCAR SAYS.

225
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,243
I SEE. LET US
CONSIDER THE QUESTION.

226
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:49,748
HOW DOES BIG, FAT SANTA CLAUS
GET DOWN THOSE SKINNY CHIMNEYS?

227
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,250
WELL...AHEM.

228
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,254
LET US LOOK AT IT
FROM ANOTHER ANGLE.

229
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:58,257
UH...RETURNING
TO THE FIRST ANGLE,

230
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:01,260
IT'S A SIMPLE MATTER
OF, UH...

231
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,263
I NEVER THOUGHT
ABOUT IT BEFORE.

232
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,765
HOW DOES HE DO IT?

233
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:10,769
IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE! 
WE GOT TO FIND OUT!

234
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:14,773
WHO KNOWS MORE
ABOUT SANTA THAN ANYBODY?

235
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,275
THE ELVES.

236
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,776
MRS. CLAUS?

237
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:18,777
MACY'S.

238
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,779
KIDS. THAT'S WHO.

239
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:21,780
KIDS?

240
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,282
YEAH, KIDS!

241
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:26,285
I WILL GO ASK SOME KIDS

242
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:29,288
AND BE RIGHT BACK
WITH THE ANSWER.

243
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:34,293
KERMIT, I AM A KID, 
AND I DON'T KNOW.

244
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,296
THAT'S OUR FIRST ANSWER,
ISN'T IT?

245
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:37,796
THAT'S OUR FIRST ANSWER,
ISN'T IT?

246
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,703
GOLLY...
CHRISTMAS EVE.

247
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:47,706
I STILL DON'T
HAVE AN IDEA

248
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,708
FOR ERNIE'S PRESENT.

249
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,711
IT'S GOT TO BE
REALLY SPECIAL.

250
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:53,712
[QUACK]

251
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:55,714
WHAT IS--

252
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:58,217
OH, ERNIE'S RUBBER DUCKIE.

253
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,718
[SIGH]

254
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,220
HEY, WAIT!

255
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,223
THAT GIVES ME
A NEAT-O IDEA!

256
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:07,226
I WILL GET ERNIE
A SOAP DISH

257
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,728
TO PUT
HIS RUBBER DUCKIE IN!

258
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,231
WHAT A NIFTY IDEA!

259
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:12,231
WHAT A NIFTY IDEA!

260
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:16,235
I AM HOME, BERT.

261
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,237
OH, BERT?

262
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,739
OH! WHAT'S THIS?

263
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:24,743
IT'S A PAPER CLIP FROM
BERT'S PAPER CLIP COLLECTION.

264
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:28,747
OF COURSE!
THIS IS BERT'S 1957 ACME.

265
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:32,251
HE WOULD FEEL AWFUL
IF HE LOST THIS.

266
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:36,755
I KNOW WHAT
I WILL GET BERT FOR CHRISTMAS!

267
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:41,260
A CIGAR BOX
TO KEEP HIS PAPER CLIPS IN!

268
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,263
THEY WILL NEVER
GET LOST AGAIN.

269
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:44,263
THEY WILL NEVER
GET LOST AGAIN.

270
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,768
IF SANTA CLAUS
HAS TO DELIVER

271
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,771
ALL THOSE PRESENTS
ON CHRISTMAS EVE,

272
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:56,275
HOW DOES HE GET DOWN
THE CHIMNEY?

273
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:57,776
EASY.

274
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,279
WITH THE BAG
OF PRESENTS.

275
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:01,780
HOW?

276
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:05,284
HE COMES DOWN
WITH HIS REINDEERS.

277
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:05,284
HE COMES DOWN
WITH HIS REINDEERS.

278
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:09,788
ALL THE REINDEER

279
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,791
JOIN HIM
DOWN THE CHIMNEY?

280
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,293
YES.

281
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,795
YOU MEAN
IT'S A PARTY?

282
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:21,300
YES. THEY PUT THE PRESENTS,
THEN THEY GO UP.

283
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,802
DON'T THE ANTLERS
GET STUCK?

284
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:24,803
NO.

285
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:25,804
WHY?

286
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:28,307
HE TIES
THE ANTLERS TOGETHER...

287
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,808
WITH TAPE.

288
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:29,808
WITH TAPE.

289
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,313
TELL ME,
HOW DOES HE DO IT?

290
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,814
HE SLIDES!

291
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,316
SLIDES?

292
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:41,320
WAIT! MAYBE HE IS MAGIC
AND GROWS SMALL.

293
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,821
THROUGH THE DOOR.

294
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,823
HE GOTS
HIS KEYS.

295
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,825
WHAT KEYS?

296
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:50,329
SANTA CLAUS KEYS.

297
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,331
HE SQUISHES!

298
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,333
WHAT HAPPENS
IF SANTA

299
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,835
CANNOT GET DOWN
THE CHIMNEY,

300
00:18:56,835 --> 00:19:00,339
AND THE WINDOW
AND DOOR ARE LOCKED?

301
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,841
HE WILL NEVER
BRING THE PRESENTS

302
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,843
EVER AGAIN!

303
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,345
WHAT HAPPENS?

304
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:08,347
I DON'T KNOW.

305
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,849
MAYBE THEY WILL MOVE.

306
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,851
HE PUSHES THE BUTTON,

307
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:16,355
THEN IT OPENS,
AND HE GETS IN!

308
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:20,859
HE STEPS ON THE BIG STEP,
THEN HE GOES IN.

309
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,862
AND THERE
YOU HAVE IT.

310
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,864
SPIRIT

311
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,866
GIVING

312
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,368
PEACE

313
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,870
BOB IS COMING!

314
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:31,870
BOB IS COMING!

315
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,273
HI, KIDS.

316
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:35,774
HI, BOB.

317
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,776
LINDA, YOU ARE EARLY.

318
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:42,781
WE HAVE TO REHEARSE
A SONG WITH THE KIDS.

319
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:46,285
WOULD YOU MIND WAITING?

320
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:49,788
MAYBE YOU CAN
READ A MAGAZINE.

321
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,290
O.K.?

322
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,791
O.K. GOOD.

323
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:52,791
O.K. GOOD.

324
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,795
EVERYBODY
ALL READY?

325
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,297
YES.

326
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:02,301
RUBY, WOULD YOU
TURN PAGES FOR ME?

327
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,802
O.K.

328
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:07,306
WHEN I GIVE YOU
THE NOD, O.K.?

329
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:08,807
HERE WE GO.

330
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:08,807
HERE WE GO.

331
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:23,322
## WHEN CHRISTMAS TIME
IS OVER ##

332
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,824

333
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:29,328
## DON'T BE SAD ##

## AND, OH, THE GOOD TIMES
HURRY BY SO FAST ##

340
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:58,357
## BUT EVEN WHEN IT'S OVER ##

341
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:01,860
## THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU CAN DO ##

342
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:10,369

I HAVE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS
TO WORRY ABOUT.

906
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:32,950

I'LL SAY TO SANTA CLAUS,

907
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:38,455
"O.K. IF I WATCH YOU GO DOWN

00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:11,488

OUT TONIGHT.

I DIDN'T KNOW HE'D DO
ANYTHING DUMB.

00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:30,567
I WAS TEASING.

940
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:34,071
TELLING HIM SANTA WON'T
BRING ANYBODY PRESENTS

941
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:38,075

DOWN THE TINY CHIMNEY!

THE NEST IS DIFFERENT.
THAT'S HIS HOME.

947
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:54,591
HE'S GOT AN ELECTRIC
BLANKET THERE.

IT KEEPS SNOWING,
AND IT'S GETTING COLDER.
