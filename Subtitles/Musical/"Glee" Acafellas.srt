1
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:07,933
When did you start cooking, Terri?

2
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,873
Oh, it's just hamburger casserole.

3
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:12,070
Look out for bones.

4
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:20,085
I'm sorry. I, uh...

5
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:23,520
I can't hold it in any longer. Um...

6
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,922
Mom, Dad...

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,424
- Terri's pregnant.
- What?

8
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,987
<i>- It's a boy.
- Oh!</i>

9
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:34,499
Our first grandbaby!

10
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:37,035
<i>- Oh, that's fantastic.
- Thank you.</i>

11
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:39,162
- Yeah. Sweetheart? Honey.
- Yeah?

12
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,673
I thought we weren't gonna tell anybody yet.

13
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:44,403
Your secret is safe with me.
I spent six months in the Hanoi Hilton.

14
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:46,502
- Never said a word. Am I right, Doodle?
- That's right, honey.

15
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,706
Oh.

16
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:51,250
Yeah, we're gonna
turn the craft room into the nursery.

17
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:54,115
- Oh! Show me!
- Okay.

18
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:02,527
I'm really happy for you, Son.

19
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:05,359
Tell you the truth, I'm terrified.

20
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,366
I... don't know how to do this.

21
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:11,131
No one does. Look at me. I was a mess.

22
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:14,765
I worked all the time, traveling.
I was too strict.

23
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:17,605
Okay, you're not instilling me
with a great deal of confidence here, Dad.

24
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:23,877
I mean, I'm already up all night
thinkin' about this.

25
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,852
That's my fault... uh, the confidence thing.

26
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,355
Boys learn that from their fathers.

27
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:37,690
I started at Zuckerman and Zuckerman in college.
I needed some extra cash.

28
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:41,461
I was saving up... for law school.

29
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:47,565
But I never went. I... never even applied.

30
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,904
Didn't have the balls.

31
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,536
So I settled for insurance.
I mean, who was I to become a lawyer?

32
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:56,207
You would've been a great one.
You're the smartest guy I know.

33
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,341
It's not about brains, Son.

34
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:05,817
Being a good father...
Hell, being a man is all about one thing.

35
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,588
Guts.

36
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:12,062
And you've got about six months
to figure out if you have any.

37
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:18,030
<i>Five, six, seven, eight.</i>

38
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:22,165
Step and step up. Just step and step.

39
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:26,042
<i>And turn around and down and up.</i>

40
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:28,842
<i>And hit, hit. Down. Hit.</i>

41
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,940
<i>Uh, c-could we stop, please?</i>

42
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:33,850
You don't have to ask every time
for permission to go to the bathroom, Rachel.

43
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,445
- You can just go.
- It's not my bladder.

44
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:40,254
- It's the choreography.
- Okay, what's wrong with the choreography?

45
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,294
- It sucks.
- It's completely unoriginal.

46
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,694
Aren't you guys gonna get shunned
for talking to me?

47
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,733
Sweetie, we're a team now.

48
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,598
But you gotta do something about
Mr. Schue's dance routines.

49
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,264
We can't compete with Vocal Adrenaline
with these steps.

50
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,773
You're a great vocal coach, Mr. Schue...

51
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,209
<i>but... you're not a... trained choreographer.</i>

52
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,442
That's what we need to be the best.

53
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,415
We need Dakota Stanley.

54
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:08,420
He's the best show choir choreographer
in the Midwest. He works with Vocal Adrenaline.

55
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,149
You can't take regionals without him.

56
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,919
<i>He was the understudy to the candelabra
in Beauty and the Beast...</i>

57
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,653
on Broadway.

58
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:17,696
Just because he understudied
doesn't mean he ever performed.

59
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:21,393
<i>Did you ever perform, Mr. Schuester?</i>

60
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,799
After high school. Did you even try?

61
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:28,398
<i>I wanted to. That was my dream, you know?</i>

62
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:31,637
- I-I just never had...
- The guts?

63
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,941
They say it takes
more certainty than talent to be a star.

64
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:36,846
I mean, look at, um... look at John Stamos.

65
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:43,619
I don't know. I guess I'm... also
just nervous about being a dad.

66
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,148
I want my kid to be proud of me.
I want to set a good example, you know?

67
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,861
I hope it's cool,
me unloading on you like this.

68
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:55,196
- l-l-I don't want there to be any awkwardness.
- Oh, no. No. None at all.

69
00:03:55,268 --> 00:04:00,137
I mean, especially since we're...
we're both in relationships now, both of us.

70
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,299
- Right.
- I'm in a relationship. You're in a relationship.

71
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,309
- Exactly. Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

72
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:08,608
- H-How's it goin' with Ken?
- Great. It's great. It's wonderful.

73
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:12,947
I mean, you know, he's flawed, but he...
he knows who he is, and that's... that's great...

74
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,217
and there really is nothing sexier in a man
than... than confidence, you know?

75
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,685
- Huh?
- Huh.

76
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:29,996
Sandy. I thought you weren't allowed on campus.

77
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:33,698
No, William. I'm not allowed
within 50 feet of children.

78
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,798
Besides, Henri and I go way back.

79
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:39,038
I got him a job
before we even had a shop class.

80
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:43,378
Uh, I told Figgins that you are going to have
a school full of nancys...

81
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,213
unless you get some hot wood
in those teenagers' hands.

82
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,380
<i>- Here comes Henri.
- Oh, shoot.</i>

83
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,116
<i>Terri was supposed to bring a cake.</i>

84
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,387
I'm back.

85
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:03,463
<i>Henri had a little problem
with over-the-counter cough medicine.</i>

86
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:09,397
<i>He ended up cutting off his thumbs.
It was a real tragedy.</i>

87
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:13,536
I'll never hitchhike across Europe.

88
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,672
That was a dream, man.

89
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:20,778
- Where's Terri?
- Doing inventory.

90
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:23,253
I can't count higher than 30.

91
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,444
You know, this is nice.

92
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,246
Can't remember the last time
I just hung out with the guys...

93
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,446
really talked about our feelings.

94
00:05:55,521 --> 00:06:00,049
Wanna know what I'm feeling? I live at the YMCA.
I only have one pair of long pants.

95
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:04,324
Oh, please. My life is a disaster
with no creative outlet...

96
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,991
<i>other than writing
my Desperate Housewives fan fiction.</i>

97
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,057
I'm afraid of my vacuum.

98
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:12,002
I know how you guys feel.
I apparently don't know how to dance.

99
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,335
I don't have thumbs.

100
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,803
Uh...

101
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,572
Sorry.

102
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:24,446
¶¶ For he's a jolly good fellow ¶¶

103
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:28,578
¶¶ For he's the jolly good fellow ¶¶

104
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:34,889
¶¶ For he's the jolly good fellow ¶¶

105
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:39,625
¶¶ That nobody can deny ¶¶¶¶

106
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:44,034
Hey. That was pretty good.

107
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:47,198
¶¶ This is how we do it ¶¶

108
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,968
<i>Two weeks ago...</i>

109
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,702
<i>I would have agreed that four grown men...</i>

110
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:55,510
<i>rehearsing a cappella hip-hop
in my living room was embarrassing.</i>

111
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,812
<i>But bustin' out some white-hot
new jack swing...</i>

112
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,716
<i>I'll tell you,
I've never felt more confident.</i>

113
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,449
<i>¶¶ This is how we do it
It's Friday night ¶¶</i>

114
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:06,356
<i>- Henri thought we should call our group...
- Crescendudes.</i>

115
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,519
<i>- while Ken thought...
- Testostertones.</i>

116
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:12,792
<i>was more manly, and then we heard a single
word leap Howard's lips...</i>

117
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,526
<i>and we knew we had our name.</i>

118
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,228
Acafellas.

119
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,066
<i>¶¶ Yo, we made it so good ¶¶¶¶</i>

120
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:22,505
I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille.

121
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,805
Sandy, we voted.

122
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,708
When you're in the group, it's creepy.

123
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,441
Wai... I...

124
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,550
¶¶ This is how we do it ¶¶

125
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,920
<i>- ¶¶ This is how we do it ¶¶¶¶
- Will!</i>

126
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:41,516
If I don't get some sleep, I could miscarry.

127
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:44,222
I'm sorry, Ter. Um... I'll be right in?

128
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:47,825
I hope so.

129
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,968
<i>Being in a boy band
did wonders for our love life.</i>

130
00:07:57,043 --> 00:08:00,672
<i>Seeing me feel so good about myself...</i>

131
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:03,408
<i>made my wife more attracted
to me in every way.</i>

132
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,418
<i>It was amazing. I mean...</i>

133
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,115
<i>we started doin' it once a week.</i>

134
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:13,352
<i>It was like she was tryin' to make a twin.</i>

135
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:23,029
- He's not coming.
- What happened?

136
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,730
They're my famous sugar cookies.

137
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,466
I bake them for the poor
during Christmastime...

138
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,565
but I whipped up a special batch
just for you.

139
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:32,907
I wanted to say how sorry I was
for what I said.

140
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,914
Don't be. You were right.

141
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,712
You know, the truth is, Rachel,
if you weren't so hard on me...

142
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,752
I never would have had the guts
to start Acafellas.

143
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,779
But... We need you, Mr. Schue.

144
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,121
<i>You've missed six rehearsals
in the past couple of weeks...</i>

145
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,991
and when you're there,
you're not really there.

146
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:52,724
- Which is why I think you should
go ahead and hire Montana.
- Dakota.

147
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,629
Whatever.

148
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,793
<i>You know, I'll still be there...</i>

149
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,530
to help you guys sing and stuff...

150
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:01,095
but, uh, I just don't have time
for all of it anymore.

151
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:07,403
Of course he doesn't want anything to do
with us after you kicked him in the 'nads!

152
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,880
Then why did he thank me?

153
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,713
<i>The goal is to win,
and now that Mr. Schuester...</i>

154
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:15,777
has agreed to let us hire
Dakota Stanley, we can.

155
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:19,586
But he doesn't want us to. He just doesn't
have the confidence to coach us anymore.

156
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:23,618
- Guys are real sensitive when
it comes to this kind of stuff.
- And that's my fault?

157
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:27,530
You see anyone else in here with a plate of
"I'm sorry" cookies? I don't. Just you.

158
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,796
I'm bored.

159
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:33,270
All those in favor of hiring Dakota Stanley...

160
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,483
Hey, wait up.
Y-You can't do this to Mr. Schuester.

161
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,546
What? Make him a hero?

162
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:54,525
Once we hire Dakota and win nationals,
he'll thank me for it.

163
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,586
- You heard Santana. It's all about winning.
- Since when?

164
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,427
Look, you have your popular clique
and your football...

165
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,228
and your cliché of a blonde girlfriend.

166
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,599
Glee is my one shot.
If this doesn't work out...

167
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,036
then my whole high school life
will be nothing but an embarrassment.

168
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,234
Wh-What's a "cliché"? Is that a bad thing?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

169
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:13,403
Is this one of those chick things
where you're pissed about one thing...

170
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,710
but you're just pretending like
you're pissed about something else 'cause...

171
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,545
I don't know what you're talking about.

172
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,916
Well, for a while there,
you were kind of all over me...

173
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,251
and now you just yell at me all the time.

174
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,586
Makes me think you're still upset
about what happened in the auditorium.

175
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:28,855
I'm not. I've moved on
and I'm focusing on my career now.

176
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,919
- D-Do you wanna talk about it?
- No.

177
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:34,728
And neither do you.
It's kind of ironic how you're Mr. Popular...

178
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,064
and I'm just this nobody
that everybody makes fun of.

179
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,661
But I have enough confidence
to say out loud...

180
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:42,207
that what happened between us
in the auditorium was real.

181
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,835
You have feelings for me
and you just don't have the guts to admit it.

182
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,179
We're hiring Dakota Stanley.

183
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,579
Even if it means me quitting?

184
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,758
Yes.

185
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,407
It's a good start.
You're sowing the seeds of destruction.

186
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:21,139
- Mr. Schuester
barely even shows up for rehearsals.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

187
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:26,116
"Barely" will not cut it. I will not be satisfied
until Glee Club is disbanded.

188
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:30,281
And what about this Dakota character?
Any chance he actually helps?

189
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,916
They're soft. He'll eat them alive.

190
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:38,453
I give them 15 minutes before the first one
quits or tries to commit suicide.

191
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,398
You know, ladies...

192
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,402
learned a lot in Special Forces.

193
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,099
I was on the strike team in Panama
when we extracted Noriega.

194
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,506
We took out the shepherd...

195
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:52,737
then we went after the sheep.

196
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:56,748
You need to go after
these Glee Clubbers one by one.

197
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:59,376
I want my full budget restored.

198
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,820
I need a fog machine.

199
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:20,770
- Have you ever kissed anybody?
- Yes...

200
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,104
if by "someone" you mean
the tender crook of my elbow.

201
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:28,010
No, I haven't.

202
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,911
But I want to.

203
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,954
Okay. Stop it right there, Mercedes.
We are in Glee Club.

204
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:41,015
That means we are at the bottom
of the social heap.

205
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,357
Special Ed kids
will get more play than we will.

206
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:48,867
The only thing that gets me by is my knowledge
that we are superior to all of them.

207
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,200
What are you wearing on our
Operation Dakota Stanley field trip?

208
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,108
- Is there a dress code?
- No, but every moment of your life...

209
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,408
is an opportunity for fashion.

210
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,710
We'll hit the mall after school.
Meet me at lunch.

211
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,718
Okay.

212
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,651
You should totally scoop that.

213
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,916
I don't think I'm his type.

214
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,821
Oh, I think you are.

215
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,884
Just follow our lead. We've got your back.

216
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:24,797
Poison!
Yeah, Spider-Man and Freeze in full effect.

217
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,531
- You ready, Ken?
- I'm ready.

218
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:29,335
- You ready, Henri?
- I'm ready, Will.

219
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,672
- Are you?
- Oh, yeah. Break it down.

220
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,769
- ¶¶ Yeah ¶¶
- ¶¶ Girl, I must ¶¶

221
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:38,340
- ¶¶ Warn you ¶¶
- ¶¶ I sense something strange in my mind ¶¶

222
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,350
- ¶¶ The situation is ¶¶
- ¶¶ Serious ¶¶

223
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:47,654
¶¶ Let's cure it 'cause
we're running out of time ¶¶

224
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:53,124
¶¶ Can't get her out of my head ¶¶

225
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,600
<i>- ¶¶ Miss her, kiss her, love her ¶¶
- ¶¶ Wrong move, you're dead ¶¶</i>

226
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:01,936
- ¶¶ That girl is ¶¶
- ¶¶ Poison ¶¶

227
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,238
- ¶¶ Whoa, whoa, oh, oh ¶¶
- ¶¶ Never trust a big butt and a smile ¶¶

228
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,575
- ¶¶ That girl is ¶¶
- ¶¶ Poison ¶¶

229
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,140
¶¶ Poison, deadly, movin' it slow ¶¶

230
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,311
¶¶ Lookin' for a mellow fellow like DeVoe ¶¶

231
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:16,980
¶¶ Gettin' paid, laid, so better lay low ¶¶

232
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,751
¶¶ Schemin' on the hots
My end, the pro show ¶¶

233
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,883
¶¶ Low pro ho
should be cut like an Afro ¶¶

234
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,259
¶¶ See what you're sayin' , huh
She weighin' you but I know she's a loser ¶¶

235
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,822
- ¶¶ How do you know ¶¶
- ¶¶ Me and the crew used to do her ¶¶¶¶

236
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:37,465
Yea, Ken! Ken Tanaka!

237
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:42,242
<i>In my own little way,
I felt like I was finally...</i>

238
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,407
<i>a star.</i>

239
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,178
Thank you so much.

240
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,947
Acafellas!

241
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,147
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Son!

242
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,783
This is huge! We just sold
all 17 copies of your CD.

243
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,986
I didn't even have to show
any of them my bosoms.

244
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,927
You know, honey? Go get yourself a Sanka.

245
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,023
- Yeah.
- Okay.

246
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,159
Thanks, Mom. Good job.

247
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,765
I bought one for my grandson...

248
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:12,640
so he can hear for himself
how good his old man was.

249
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:15,009
<i>- Ah.
- Schue!</i>

250
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,207
That was an amazing performance!

251
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:20,616
Oh, thank you. I mean...
You know, we're just starting out, so...

252
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:23,348
Look, there's a P.T.A. meeting
next Thursday night...

253
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,287
and I want Acafellas to be the main event.

254
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,723
I need those parents happy!

255
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:31,627
They found out
we've been serving the children prison food.

256
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,304
Great job, Son.

257
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:41,805
<i>- Well?
- "Is it too soon to call Will Schuester...</i>

258
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,535
"the next Michael Bublé?

259
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,806
"The audience last Thursday
at Benchwarmers Sports Bar didn't think so.

260
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,847
<i>"And Ken Tanaka's smoky baritone...</i>

261
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:54,511
"is like a cool fog that sweeps over
a deep ocean of emotional intensity.

262
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,747

Only Howard"...

266
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:09,131
<i>Um, sorry, Howard.
They didn't say anything about you.</i>

267
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:12,500
<i>"Buckle up, Ohio.
Are you ready for a new musical sensation?</i>

268
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:16,029
You'd better be,

269
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,338
Yes!

270
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,244
Oh, congratulations
on your dead-tree valentine, gentlemen.

271
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,214
By the way, I want in.

272
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,774
Stop right there, William.

273
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,480
I've got two words for you.

274
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,420
Josh Groban.

275
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,790
- He's coming to the P.T.A. event.
- Who is Josh Groban?

276
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:38,694
Who is Josh Groban? Kill yourself!

277
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:44,093
He is an angel sent from heaven...

278
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,933
to deliver platinum records unto us.

279
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,908
And if he were here right now, I would club you
to death with his Critics' Choice Award.

280
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:56,039
<i>- Why would he come to our show?
- Because I invited him.</i>

281
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:59,209
Josh and I have become frequent pen pals...

282
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,718
since he accidentally friended me on MySpace.

283
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,483
<i>And being my close personal confidant...</i>

284
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,956
he is only interested if I am in the group.

285
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:11,595
No, Sandy.

286
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:14,257
We have standards.

287
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,329
Okay. Fine.

288
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:22,238
But just so you know,
the blogs are all atwitter.

289
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:26,266
They say he's looking for an opening act.

290
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,115
Damn, Kurt. This car is fly.

291
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,953
My dad got it for my Sweet 16...

292
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:42,823
after I swore to stop wearing
form-fitting sweaters that stop at the knee.

293
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,193
What he doesn't know doesn't hurt him.

294
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,859
Are we even sure they're rehearsing today?

295
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:52,870
Vocal Adrenaline rehearses every day
from 2:30 until midnight.

296
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:59,476
<i>I'm just so nervous these Vocal Adrenaline kids
are gonna laugh at us.</i>

297
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,206
They're so cool and popular...

298
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,475
and we look like
we just stepped off the short bus.

299
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:08,714
Those sweaty Nazis have just had
more time to practice. We have more heart.

300
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:11,688
And you don't look touched in the head.
That outfit is amazing.

301
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,626
<i>So would you ever... you know, wanna hang out?</i>

302
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,630
<i>Come over. It's Liza Minnelli week on AMC.</i>

303
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:22,496
Guys, that's Andrea Cohen.
She won outstanding soloist...

304
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,968
last year in "Absolutely Tampastic."

305
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:28,473
You can't leave rehearsals for any reason.

306
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,202
<i>That includes heat exhaustion
or Crohn's disease.</i>

307
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,744
Are you guys Vocal Adrenaline?
We'd like to talk to Dakota Stanley...

308
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,803
about choreographing for our Glee Club.

309
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,542
Don't!

310
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,550
He's a monster.

00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,734
¶¶ Give me some mercy ¶¶

327
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:40,369
¶¶ I said release ¶¶

328
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,709
- ¶¶ Me ¶¶
- ¶¶ Yeah, yeah, yeah ¶¶¶¶

329
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,217
Get off my stage!

330
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:53,322
<i>Mr. Stanley,
we're the McKinley High Glee Club!</i>

331
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,917
<i>- No interviews!
- We'd like you to choreograph for us.</i>

332
00:19:55,994 --> 00:20:01,762
Look, my fee is $8,000 per number,
plus a $10,000 bonus if you place in the top three.

333
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:06,270
And with Dakota Stanley at the wheel,
you will place at the top three. Move it.

334
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,900
How are we gonna get $8,000?

335
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,245
Kick that way, and back.

336
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,846
- And kick out...
- Hold on.

337
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:26,948
- Okay. One more. Let me...
- Okay.

338
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:28,686
- Kick out...
- Kick...

339
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,660
Right behind you. It's all right.

340
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,959
Hey, where is everybody?

341
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:36,489
Uh, Sandy went to get Henri from wood shop, and...
Oh. There's Howard.

342
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,935
- Hello?
- I don't think I can be in the band anymore.

343
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:43,839
- What?
- Like doing inventory...

344
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,036
it was never my dream.

345
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:51,806
Howard's out.

346
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:54,113
Oh, that...
That's just great. What's he...

347
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,950
Hey, Emma.

348
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,547
You didn't, uh,
see me dancin' earlier, did you?

349
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,650
Oh, is that what that was?

350
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:05,493
- Look, I have some bad news.
- You're breakin' up with me.

351
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:10,694
- What, here, in front of another dude?
- No. Please stop talking.

352
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,795
Um, no. Look, I think
the Acafellas pressure...

353
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:15,806
has proven to be a little too much for Henri.

354
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:19,435
- Really? Why?
- Well, he just downed six bottles of cough syrup...

355
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,274
which is a lot, even for him.

356
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,940
Um, he's okay.
Sandy's in the emergency room with him now...

357
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:27,782
but Figgins is insisting before he comes back...
and can be around kids again...

358
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:31,345
that he goes to rehab,
so that's where he's going tomorrow morning.

359
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:35,484
That's just great.
So Acafellas is officially doomed now.

360
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:40,691
Do you know, uh...
When I get stressed, I... I work out.

361
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,427
You can probably tell. So I'm gonna, uh...

362
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:47,234
down some Power Bars, knock off a few reps,
come up with some solutions here.

363
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,709
It was fun while it lasted.

364
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:58,909
I don't think you should
give up so easy, Will.

365
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:02,920
You know, they said Van Halen was dead
after David Lee Roth quit...

366
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,718
but my worn-out single of"Right Now"
says that they were wrong.

367
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:17,235
You got a sec, Mr. Schue?

368
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:21,068
- Yeah, of course. What's up?
- I just wanted to tell you that I'm quitting Glee too.

369
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:23,699
Uh... I didn't quit Glee.

370
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:27,609
Well, you might as well have.
It's nutty in there.

371
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,308
I try and talk sense into Rachel,
but she's gone all chick batty.

372
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,578
I've gotta be honest with you.

373
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,280
It's hard bein' the quarterback
when I get in the huddle...

374
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,085
and all the guys are calling me Deep Throat.

375
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:41,455
Glee's bringing down my rep, man.

376
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:45,554
Have the guts to stick
with it a little bit longer.

377
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,895
You are a gifted performer, Finn.

378
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:53,495
You can't quit now. If you do, you're just
gonna regret it for the rest of your life.

379
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,472
Trust me. I know.

380
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,104
It's just not fun anymore.

381
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:05,649
Hey, Finn. Wait.

382
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,613
There's something I wanna talk to you about.

383
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:13,616
- Hey, Coach.
- What do you want, Puckerman?

384
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,718
I hear there's a vacancy
in your a capella group.

385
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:20,925
I wanna offer my services.

386
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:24,457
I play guitar, and actually,
I'm a really good singer.

387
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:29,270
There are a lot of moms at your gigs, right?

388
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,639
<i>Well, here's the thing
you should know about me.</i>

389
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,840
<i>I'm not like everybody else in this crappy
cow town. I've got star potential...</i>

390
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:40,681
<i>and more specifically, I'm tired of wasting
my time with high school girls.</i>

391
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,380
You're breaking up with me. Why?

392
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,116
Your credit score is terrible.

393
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,057
What I need, as a woman,
is financial security.

394
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:51,527
<i>See, young girls will shoot you down
and make you feel terrible about yourself.</i>

395
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,690
<i>But a cougar... never disappoints.</i>

396
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:58,167
Thanks, Mrs. H.

397
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:01,831
- Is that a nipple ring?
- Yeah. I'm kind of rock and roll.

398
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:05,502
I need your help unclogging my bathtub drain.

399
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,707
<i>The proof was in a sexual pudding.</i>

400
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,307
<i>My aboveground pool cleaning business
went through the roof...</i>

401
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,216
<i>once I embraced my gift for music...</i>

402
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,484
<i>and gave these fine ladies
the romance they were missing.</i>

403
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,422
<i>I also stopped beatin' people up so much.</i>

404
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:22,687
When do we start rehearsals?

405
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,693
Now you listen to me, you little psychopath.

406
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:31,099
My love life is hanging by a thread,
and that thread is Acafellas.

407
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:34,138
It drives my girlfriend nuts in the pants.

408
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,538
So if you screw this up for me,
I swear to you...

409
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,599
I will stick my fist so far down your throat...

410
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,770
you will taste my armpit hairs!

411
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:45,249
Do I make myself clear? Good.

412
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,547
We rehearse Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8:00.

413
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,487
Don't be late.

414
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,690
<i>Okay. Come on.</i>

415
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:06,070
<i>Dude, my bowels have better moves than you.</i>

416
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:09,265
Guys, stop. You guys got the steps down.

417
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,435
You just... need to relax, okay?

418
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,537
Um... You guys play baseball, right?

419
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,377
What does your coach tell you about hitting?

420
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:21,408
- You charge the pitcher, bring the bat.
- Okay. Um...

421
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:23,545
I'm sure he also tells you to relax, right?

422
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:27,581
'Cause hitting's all about the hips, right?
Gotta loosen 'em up.

423
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,593
Just swing that bat. All right.

424
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:32,221
Pretend... Acafellas, Madison Square Garden.

425
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,595
Here we are.
All those beautiful ladies out there.

426
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,260
Swing that big ol' bat. Bam!

427
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:40,668
Hit some home runs.
All right, guys? All right.

428
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:43,003
Let's try from the top, okay?

429
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,008
Here we go.

430
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,744
Five, six, seven, eight.

431
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:53,507
Yeah.

432
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:03,018
Oh, yeah. Yeah, get those hips into it.

433
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:06,495
Ha-ha! That's it! That's it. All right!

434
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,193
Uh!

435
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:14,000
<i>- That baseball thing sure was good,
Mr. Schue. Totally.
- It was awesome.</i>

436
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:20,871
We need to have a gayvention.
That's a gay intervention.

437
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:24,347
<i>It's K-Kurt. He's lady fabulous.</i>

438
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,213
It's obvious you like him.

439
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:30,186
We just don't want you to get hurt
by feelings he can't... reciprocate.

440
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,985
Look, just because he wears nice clothes...

441
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:35,356
doesn't mean he's on the down low.

442
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,657
He wore a corset to second period today.

443
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:40,562
<i>You can do better, Mercedes.</i>

444
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:44,864
Really? Well, what if I can't? You know,
there's not a lot of guys around here...

445
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,029
knocking down my door for a date.

446
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,505
Or yours, for that matter.

447
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:54,375
Nobody notices us. Hello? We're in Glee Club.

448
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,574
And I'm tired of being lonely. Aren't you?

449
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:00,948
But Kurt... Kurt is sweet to me...

450
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:03,886
and he likes who I am
and I like how I feel when I'm with him.

451
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:07,254
And he's in our group.
He understands what I'm going through.

452
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:12,422
Now maybe that's not enough for you guys,
but it's enough for me.

453
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,575
<i>You know what, Sue?
I gotta say I really misjudged you.</i>

454
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,946
Getting the Cheerios to help out
with the Glee Club choreographer fund-raiser...

455
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,645
<i>is one of the nicest things I've ever seen.</i>

456
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:39,622
Well, Erma, I'm willing to do whatever
it takes to make this Glee Club successful.

457
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:42,159
<i>- Come on!
- Oh. Oh, excited.</i>

458
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,218
Oh, I love a car wash too, you know.

459
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:47,628
When I was little, if I got all A's,
my dad would let me wash his car...

460
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:50,600
so I'd get my little toothbrush out,
and I'd clean it all weekend long...

461
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:54,127
You know, the way you use your mental illness
to help these kids is really inspiring.

462
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:56,264
I'm shocked you're not married.

463
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:02,639
Your rims are clean.

464
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:04,614
We polished them, like, three times already.

465
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,344
Did you bring a change of clothes...

466
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,386
<i>because we're going straight
to the sing-along Sound of Music.</i>

467
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:11,547
So, listen, Kurt,
this is, like, the third time we've gone out.

468
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:15,059
<i>- Can't we just make it official?
- Make what official?</i>

469
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:17,253
You know, that we're dating.

470
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:21,231
I'm sorry, Mercedes,
but I thought I made it very clear.

471
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,592
I'm in love with someone else.

472
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,808
Rachel?

473
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,369
Yes. For several years now.

474
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:03,831
¶¶ I bust the windows out your car ¶¶

475
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:08,140
¶¶ And no, it didn't mend
my broken heart ¶¶

476
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:12,775
¶¶ I'll probably always have
these ugly scars ¶¶

477
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:16,981
¶¶ But right now I don't care
about that part ¶¶

478
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:20,616
¶¶ I bust the windows out your car, hey ¶¶

479
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:25,686
<i>¶¶ After I saw you looking right at her ¶¶</i>

480
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:29,996
¶¶ I didn't wanna, but I took my turn ¶¶

481
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:31,729
¶¶ I'm glad I did it ¶¶

482
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:36,240
¶¶ 'Cause you had to learn ¶¶

483
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:40,835
¶¶ I must admit it helped a little bit ¶¶

484
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:44,507
¶¶ To think of how you felt
when you saw it ¶¶

485
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:50,077
¶¶ I didn't know that I had
that much strength ¶¶

486
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:53,522
¶¶ But I'm glad you see
what happens when ¶¶

487
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:56,424
¶¶ Hah, hah, hah, hah ¶¶

488
00:29:56,494 --> 00:30:00,590
¶¶ I bust the windows out your car ¶¶

489
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:04,499
¶¶ You know I did it 'cause
I left my mark ¶¶

490
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:09,063
¶¶ Wrote my initials with a crowbar ¶¶

491
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:13,440
¶¶ And then I drove off into the dark ¶¶

492
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:17,914
¶¶ I bust the windows out your car, hey ¶¶

493
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:22,681
¶¶ You should feel lucky
that that's all I did ¶¶

494
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:26,747
- ¶¶ After five whole years of this bull ¶¶
- Shh...

495
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:30,921
¶¶ Gave you all of me
and you played with it ¶¶

496
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:35,159
¶¶ I bust the windows out your car ¶¶¶¶

497
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:39,567
<i>You busted my window.
How could you do that? You busted my window!</i>

498
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,631
Well, you busted my heart. Hmm!

499
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:01,448
Okay. Please examine your personalized menus.

500
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,825
This is what you're gonna be eating
for the next six months.

501
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:07,660
- Um, mine just says "coffee."
- Mm-hmm.

502
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:11,133
<i>- What's "smelt"?
- A pungent, low carb freshwater fish.</i>

503
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:14,694
<i>Okay, let's start with today's business.
Artie, you're cut. You're not trying hard enough.</i>

504
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:16,797
- At what?
- At walking.

505
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,968
<i>Can't be wheeling you around
during every number.</i>

506
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:22,410
Throws off the whole dynamic,
and it's depressing.

507
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,471
- So you're kicking him out?
- Mm-hmm.

508
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:28,110
Also you.
You's gotta go, F.A. Oh, no, no, no. Yeah.

509
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,916
<i>You can't kick people out of Glee Club
because you don't like the way they look.</i>

510
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:34,015
Uh, why don't you shut your face gash
and stay away from aerosol cans...

511
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:36,322
because you could
burst into flames at any second.

512
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,158
You three. You're great. You're perfect.
Seriously, don't change a thing.

513
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,130
<i>Uh, you... Uh. Nose job.</i>

514
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,997
- Now just hold on a second...
- What? What was that, Frankenteen?

515
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,593
Why don't you, uh,
wipe that dopey look off your face...

516
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:49,367
and get some lotion for those knuckles
you've been draggin' on the ground?

517
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,271
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with me?

518
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:55,369
What's wrong with me is that you're freakishly tall!
I feel like a woodland creature!

519
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:59,608
Am I hurting your feelings?
Did I say something wrong?

520
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:04,383
Because I thought you wanted somebody
who respected you enough to tell you the truth.

521
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:07,982
<i>But maybe you don't have
the confidence to hear it. Hmm?</i>

522
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:11,256
Maybe you need somebody
who's going to lie to you...

523
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,627
<i>and tell you things like,
"You got what it takes."</i>

524
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:16,997
But you know what?
As far as I can see, you don't.

525
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:20,504
<i>So, why don't you just take a little second,
take a breather...</i>

526
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:24,507
and ask yourself, "Do I wanna be a winner"...

527
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,873
<i>"or not?"</i>

528
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,880
Screw this. I quit.

529
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,246
<i>- Me t-t-too.
- Let's roll, Artie.</i>

530
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:36,310
No. Great. Great! Separate the wheat
from the chaff. That's perfect!

531
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:37,752
Wait.

532
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:42,717
Barbra Streisand.

533
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,853
When Barbra was a young ingénue,
everyone told her...

534
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:47,420
in order to be a star,
she'd have to get a nose job.

535
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:50,399
- Thankfully, she refused.
- Where's this going, Yentl?

536
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,732
Where it's going is that...

537
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,736
we don't need you.

538
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:59,903
Let's face it. We're never gonna be
as good of dancers as Vocal Adrenaline.

539
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:04,578
We're gonna win because... we're different.

540
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,277
<i>And that's what makes us special.</i>

541
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:10,287
They told J. Lo her booty was too big.

542
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:13,882
Curtis Mayfield was more successful
after he became paralyzed.

543
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:17,894
- Jim Abbott.
- I have no idea who that is.

544
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:21,864
He was a one-armed pitcher for the Yankees.
Pitched a no-hitter.

545
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:26,461
<i>Okay, so... Um, misfits and spaz-heads
and cripples can make it too.</i>

546
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:28,198
That's great. What's your point?

547
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:30,832
Our point is that...

548
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:33,399
you're fired.

549
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:35,708
And I'm taller than you.

550
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:39,409
Uh... Barely.

551
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,120
Wait. We have to wear mascara?

552
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,883
Sandy says it makes our eyes pop.

553
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:49,154
Okay.

554
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,024
- Okay.
- There's a lot of moms out there, right?

555
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:52,824
<i>Guys, don't worry about it.</i>

556
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:55,229
Just get in the zone, all right?
This is gonna be fun.

557
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:59,099
Believe me. You're gonna remember this night
for the rest of your lives.

558
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,730
- Mr. Schue?
- I know. You're nervous.

559
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:04,070
No, that isn't what I wanted to tell you.

560
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:08,078
It's just... thanks... for believing in me.

561
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:14,310
<i>He's here! He's here! Josh Groban is here.</i>

562
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:18,151
Front row, big brown eyes,
cute as a buttermilk biscuit. I barfed.

563
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,986
- He actually showed up? I can't believe it.
- Gentlemen.

564
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,392
Forget every experience
you have ever had in your drab little lives.

565
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:28,330
This is the most important thing
you will ever do.

566
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,458
Places!

567
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:34,331
- Ah, ticktock, you don't stop.
- Stop.

568
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,669
- To the ah, ticktock, you don't stop.
- Stop.

569
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,709
To the ah, ticktock, you don't stop.

570
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:42,177
- To the ah, ticktock...
- I know you're not gonna sing that song.

571
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:45,977
To the ah, ticktock, you don't stop.

572
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,041
To the ah, ticktock, you don't stop.

573
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:51,111
<i>- ¶¶ To the ah, ticktock ¶¶
- I know you're not gonna sing that song.</i>

574
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:53,282
¶¶ Come inside, take off your coat ¶¶

575
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,222
¶¶ I'll make you feel at home ¶¶

576
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:57,921
<i>¶¶ Now let's pour a glass of wine ¶¶</i>

577
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:00,463
¶¶ 'Cause now we're all alone ¶¶

578
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:02,328
¶¶ I've been waiting all night ¶¶

579
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,733
¶¶ So just let me hold you close to me ¶¶

580
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:07,828
¶¶ 'Cause I've been dyin' for you, girl ¶¶

581
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:10,499
¶¶ To make love to me ¶¶

582
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:14,705
¶¶ I wanna sex you up ¶¶

583
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,679
To the ah, ticktock, you don't stop.

584
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:19,181
To the ah, ticktock, you don't stop.

585
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:23,687
¶¶ Let me take off all your clothes ¶¶

586
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:28,748
¶¶ Disconnect the phone
so nobody knows, yeah ¶¶

587
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:33,991
¶¶ Let me light a candle so that
we can make it better ¶¶

588
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:39,025
¶¶ Makin' love until we drown, yeah ¶¶

589
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:44,541
¶¶ Girl, you make me feel real good ¶¶

590
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:48,409
¶¶ We can do it till we both wake up ¶¶

591
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:53,576
¶¶ Girl, you know I'm hooked on you ¶¶

592
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:59,612
¶¶ And this is what I'll do ¶¶

593
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:03,148
<i>¶¶ I wanna sex you up ¶¶¶¶</i>

594
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:04,888
<i>Yeah!</i>

595
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:27,413
I would like to just go into the recording studio
and lay some of those tracks down.

596
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:32,616
<i>And of course I would love to play some
bigger venues... Wembley Stadium, Red Rocks.</i>

597
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,954
Hey, guys.

598
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:39,087
I'm Josh Groban. This is my bodyguard, Flex.

599
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:42,826
<i>We were in town. I was inducting Run-D.M.C.
into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame last night...</i>

600
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,164
<i>so I thought I'd stop by and say hello.</i>

601
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:50,003
<i>- So which one of you is, uh, Sandy?
- Ooh!</i>

602
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:53,566
Mr. Groban,
we are so honored that you came here today.

603
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:56,340
- I came here to tell you...
- Yes, sir.

604
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:58,678
Stop e-mailing me.

605
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:02,685
This is a restraining order.
Stop sending me nude photos. Stop calling me!

606
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:06,154
<i>I don't know how you got my number,
how you got my number again after I changed it...</i>

607
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,751
<i>but I don't want any more of
your edible gift baskets or locks of your hair.</i>

608
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:12,523
<i>And I don't wanna read
any more of those sonnets you wrote for me.</i>

609
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:15,623
<i>- That stuff got crazy, dude.
- Are we clear?</i>

610
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,032
- Mmm.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

611
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:21,196
<i>And, by the way, great show.</i>

612
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:24,833
<i>I mean, like...
explosive.</i>

613
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,377
Thanks. Sorry.

614
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,923
I'm sorry, Will.

615
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:45,121
I... I could have been more supportive.

616
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:49,894
You guys are actually pretty good.

617
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,530
Honey, you were good.

618
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,903
You were really good.

619
00:37:56,974 --> 00:38:00,501
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

620
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:09,313
Come here.

621
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:11,150
<i>Don't bother. She's already pregnant.</i>

622
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:14,157
Hey, kids. Have you seen Doodle?

623
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:19,390
Now, you might be thinking, why would a pop star
like me come over here and talk to you?

624
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:24,196
But let me tell you something. Throngs
of screaming teenagers don't do it for Josh Groban.

625
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:26,930
No. Josh Groban loves a blowsy alcoholic.

626
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:28,665
Oh. Wow.

627
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:31,264
You'll have to forgive me.
I'm a little bit drunk...

628
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:34,038
and I'm afraid I'm not
making good choices right now.

629
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:37,474
Maybe she slipped and hit her head again.

630
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:44,052
You guys kicked some serious tail
up there tonight.

631
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:47,284
- Sorry about the whole Josh Groban thing.
- No, that's all right.

632
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:49,053
How are the other guys takin' it?

633
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:51,560
That Ryerson guy cried himself to sleep
in Figgins's arms...

634
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:54,564
and Ken Tanaka is raiding the nacho bar.

635
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,931
What about you? You okay?

636
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:03,099
You know what, Dad? I am.

637
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,506
I mean, this was all
a dream come true, but...

638
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:10,275
I'm a teacher, and a really good one.

639
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:13,849
- That's enough for me.
- I know.

640
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:15,818
I saw the way your students look at you.

641
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:18,882
You inspire people.

642
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:23,791
- Inspired me.
- What do you mean?

643
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,590
I'm going to law school.

644
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:30,532
Night classes for now,
until I get all of my prerequisites.

645
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,262
But I registered yesterday.

646
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:36,329
You made me realize it's never too late
to grow a pair and go after your dream.

647
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:39,604
That's amazing. That's so amazing.

648
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:47,411
Hey, Kurt.

649
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:52,923
I just wanted to say,
I'm really sorry I did that to your car.

650
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,651
I'll pay for it to get fixed.

651
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,592
It's okay. My dad took my baby away...

652
00:39:57,661 --> 00:40:00,960
after he found my tiara collection
in my hope chest.

653
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:04,694
And I just wanted to say,
I hope it works out between you and Rachel...

654
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:08,865
you'll have really cute, loud babies.

655
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,710
Mercedes.

656
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,812
I lied to you.

657
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:22,751
I-I don't like Rachel.

658
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,384
I'm gay.

659
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:30,654
Why didn't you just tell me?

660
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:33,959
Because I've never told anyone before.

661
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,294
You shouldn't be ashamed
of who you are, Kurt.

662
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:42,806
You should just tell people,
especially the kids in Glee.

663
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:47,936
The whole point of the club
is about expressing what's really inside you.

664
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:49,877
Remember?

665
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:54,907
I can't. I'm just not that confident,
I guess.

666
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,154
Let me get this straight.

667
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:07,663
The Glee Club got rid of Dakota Stanley...

668
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:09,631
Mr. Schuester's back...

669
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,261
and they're busy at work on a new number,
more confident than ever.

670
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:16,602
And down, clap, and up, clap, clap.

671
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:19,370
<i>Down, clap, and up, clap, clap.</i>

672
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:21,673
This is what we call
a total disaster, ladies.

673
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:24,043
I'm going to ask you to smell your armpits.

674
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:29,784
That's the smell of failure...

675
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:32,084
and it's stinking up my office.

676
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:39,220
I'm revoking your tanning privileges
for the rest of the semester.

677
00:41:39,296 --> 00:41:41,264
No!

678
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,691
<i>No!</i>

679
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:51,571
- Miss Sylvester, I wanna thank you.
- For what?

680
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:55,134
For teaching me a valuable life lesson.

681
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:57,510
When you really believe in yourself...

682
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:59,515
you don't have to bring other people down.

683
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:08,948
Uh, uh, step-ball-change and head.

684
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:12,587
<i>Step-ball-change and head. Low and high.</i>

685
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:15,291
Low and high.

686
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,301
- Uh. What do you guys think?
- Mr. Schuester?

687
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,803
Yes, Rachel?

688
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:25,006
It was really good.

689
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,835
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

690
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:31,108
Thank you. Okay. From the top!
