347
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,365
There are certain pleasures you get,
little jabs of pleasure.

348
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:43,160
When a swordfish takes the hook,
or when you watch a great fighter...

349
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,746
...getting ready for the kill, see?

350
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,290
You don't understand
a word I'm saying, do you?

351
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,876
No, not yet.
Why don't you try bullfights?

352
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,170
You're joking,
but that's exactly what I mean.

353
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,382
If you'd never seen a bullfight,
you'd know a great bullfighter...

354
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:59,385
...the moment he stepped in the ring
from the way he stood...

355
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,844
...from the way he moved.

356
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,181
Or a dancer.
You don't have to know about ballet.

357
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,059
That little bell rings inside your head...

358
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:11,480
...that little jolt of pleasure.

359
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,316
Well, that's what happened to me
just now.

360
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,653
You're a great singer.

361
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:18,987
Who, me?

362
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:21,824
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?

363
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,868
No, Mr. Maine,
no one's ever told me that before.

364

as we both thought you were...

365
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,289
...but thank you.

366
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:32,876
I'm as sober as a judge
and I know exactly what I'm saying.

367
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:37,423
You've got that little something extra
that Ellen Terry talked about.

368
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,551
Ellen Terry, great actress
long before you were born.

369
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:45,973
She said that's what star quality was,
that little something extra.

Well, you've got it.

I'm not wasting my time.

- You're wasting your time.

377

- How did you start singing?
- Oh, I--

378

- Have you got a family? You married?

Well, go on. Go ahead.

Do you know the only thing
I can think of right now?

394
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:52,748
The only thought that comes into
my mind is the way I wash my hair.

395
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:57,961
You see, when anything happens to me,
good or bad...

396
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:02,132
...I make straight for the shampoo bottle.

397
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,301
Why would I have to think of that now?

398
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,554
I understand that perfectly.
With me, it's golf balls.

399
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:12,142
If I'm happy or if I'm miserable,
I putt golf balls around the living room.

400
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,144
It makes perfect sense. Go ahead.

401
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:18,148
I'm afraid I'm no good
at talking about myself, Mr. Maine.

It's all jumbled.

408

I can't.

I can remember my first job
singing with the band.

from a big record company will come in.

Talent isn't always enough.

456

00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,422
...or recognizing the big chance
when it comes along and grabbing it.

514
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,386
- You crazy or something?
- Maybe.

515
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:27,971
Maybe, but I'm quitting.

516
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,223
Why? What happened?

517
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:41,276

a screen test.

Go on back to bed, will you, Esther?

- Okay, then when we get to Frisco...

522
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,662
...I'll take you to a doctor
and have your head examined.

523

What's the matter with you, Esther? He was
making a conventional pass, that's all.

No. No, it wasn't that, Danny.

around and gives singers screen tests?

What's got into you?

527
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:12,432
He gave me a look at myself
I've never had before.

528

He saw something in me
nobody else ever did.

- Hasn't been decorated in centuries. Sit.

And the thing to remember
about a preview...

I got a little bolder

And snuck out for their second bow

993
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:14,889

Because they needed me to milk applause

I practiced after everyone was gone

1007
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:29,005

I learned traditions

1008

1009
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:34,343

1022
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:38,783
So, what's the use
You cooked my goose

1023
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:40,868
'Cause you took advantage of me

01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:42,745
No.

1025
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:53,381
I'm so hot and bothered
That I don't know

1026
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,716
My elbow from my ear

1027
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:58,052
Suffer something awful each time you go

1028
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,555
But much worse when you're near

1029
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:03,558
Here am I with all my bridges burned

1030
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:06,269
Just a babe in arms
Where you're concerned

1031
01:16:06,436 --> 01:16:09,146
So lock the doors
Call me yours

1032
01:16:09,314 --> 01:16:14,527

1036
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:33,963
All I did was kick my feet

1037
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:38,509
You'd hardly call it a chance to sing

1038
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:41,804
But at least it was a chance to eat

1039
01:16:47,477 --> 01:16:49,353
They call it black bottom

1040
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:50,563
A new twister

1041
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:52,732
But sure got him
An old sister

1042
01:16:52,899 --> 01:16:55,651
They clap their hands
And do the raggedy trot

1043
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:58,154
Hot
Ooh!

1044
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:01,782
Old fellows with lumbago

1045
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:04,118
And young fellows, away they go

1046
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:07,121
They jump right in
And give it all that they've got

1047
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:11,292
Then one night something happened.

1048
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,753
Dame fortune showed her face.

1049
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:18,883
The star got sick
and I was told to go on in her place.

1050
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:29,894
But she recovered.

1051
01:17:32,689 --> 01:17:33,731
Oh, well.

1052
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:36,275
Black bottom
A new rhythm

1053
01:17:36,443 --> 01:17:38,653
When you spot 'em
You go with 'em

1054
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:40,905
And do that
Black, black, black, black bottom

You won't be blue
When you have got 'em

1056
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:47,745
If you do that
Black, black, black, black bottom all day

1057
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:54,335
But finally I got an offer
To sing in New York

1058
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:57,797
And I wired, "I'm on my way"

1059
01:17:57,964 --> 01:18:04,512
I had visions that this would be
A fabulous, famous cafe

Elegance and spruce

1061
01:18:11,311 --> 01:18:14,939

His plaintive little strain

My heart had no doubt

1197
01:30:01,104 --> 01:30:04,189
To share a journey

1198
01:30:04,357 --> 01:30:10,237
That leads to heaven's door

1199
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:18,370
You'll find is what I'm here

1200
01:30:19,455 --> 01:30:21,706
For

1201
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:30,966
CHORUS:
What am I here for?

1202
01:30:31,551 --> 01:30:34,928
It's time you knew

1203
01:30:35,304 --> 01:30:38,765
Here's what I'm here for

1204
01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:42,436
I'm here for you

1205
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:46,148
Can you forgive me?

1206
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:49,484
Am I too late?

1207
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:52,988
All the years that I wandered

1208
01:30:53,156 --> 01:30:58,577
And pondered were squandered

1209
01:30:59,495 --> 01:31:02,956
My heart insisted

1210
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:08,462
I seek you out

1211
01:31:08,629 --> 01:31:12,257
That you existed

1212
01:31:12,425 --> 01:31:15,177
My heart had no doubt

1213
01:31:15,344 --> 01:31:16,970
MAN 1:
Cut. That's it. Wonderful.

1214
01:31:17,138 --> 01:31:19,306
MAN 2: Maestro, very good.
Esther, listen to this one.

1215
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:20,807
Come on.

1216
01:31:20,975 --> 01:31:22,350
Okay, let's have the playback.

1217
01:31:22,518 --> 01:31:24,853
Just the last eight.
I want the chorus arrangement.

1218
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:27,481
MAN 3: Take a smoke, boys.
MAN 1: My, it sounded really good.

1219
01:31:27,648 --> 01:31:29,357
Sounded real good.

1220
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:38,325
ESTHER [SINGING ON RECORDING]:
My heart had no doubt

1221
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:41,661
To share a journey

1222
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:48,001
That leads to heaven's door

1223
01:31:48,628 --> 01:31:56,843
You'll find is what I'm here

1224
01:31:57,011 --> 01:32:00,847
For

1225
01:32:04,644 --> 01:32:07,938
CHORUS:
What am I here for?

1226
01:32:08,105 --> 01:32:11,399
ESTHER: How'd I sound?
NORMAN: Just adequate.

1227
01:32:11,567 --> 01:32:14,069
ESTHER: Best-friend-severest-critic
department, huh?

1228
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:15,529
What is this?

1229
01:32:15,696 --> 01:32:17,447
Listen to the arrangement Danny made.

1230
01:32:17,615 --> 01:32:18,823
- Oh, come on.
- Turn it off.

1231
01:32:18,991 --> 01:32:20,033
NORMAN:
I wasn't listening.

1232
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:22,452
I was thinking about another kind
of arrangement.

1233
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:23,745
ESTHER:
Another kind?

1234
01:32:23,913 --> 01:32:26,623
NORMAN:
Uh-huh. Domestic. Will you marry me?

1235
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:28,542
ESTHER:
No, thank you.

1236
01:32:28,709 --> 01:32:30,877
[SINGING]
And I wandered and pondered--

1237
01:32:31,045 --> 01:32:32,837
NORMAN:
Why not?

1238
01:32:33,005 --> 01:32:34,464
ESTHER:
Well, you're irresponsible.

1239
01:32:34,632 --> 01:32:36,258
Oh, I'm sorry.

1240
01:32:36,425 --> 01:32:39,594
NORMAN: Go ahead. Stop that.
- Get out of here.

1241
01:32:39,762 --> 01:32:40,845
What else?

1242
01:32:41,013 --> 01:32:43,598
ESTHER [SINGING]:
You drink too much

1243
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:46,977
NORMAN:
Suppose I quit drinking?

1244
01:32:47,353 --> 01:32:51,398
Suppose I become absolutely
dependable on all occasions?

1245
01:32:53,901 --> 01:32:57,487
ESTHER: You wouldn't be Norman Maine.
I'd be marrying the wrong man.

1246
01:32:57,655 --> 01:32:59,406
MAN: Quiet.
ESTHER: Norman.

1247
01:32:59,574 --> 01:33:01,116
NORMAN:
Yes?

1248
01:33:01,284 --> 01:33:06,204
ESTHER: Darling, would you do all that
for me if I said I'd marry you?

1249
01:33:06,372 --> 01:33:10,542
NORMAN: No. I've had a chance to think it
over with all that humming and singing.

1250
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:11,918
It's too much to ask.

1251
01:33:12,086 --> 01:33:13,503
You see?

1252
01:33:13,671 --> 01:33:15,755
Well, goodbye. Goodbye, everyone.

1253
01:33:15,923 --> 01:33:19,092
Oh, now, wait a minute, my boy.
That's much too public a proposal...

1254
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:21,595
...for me to say no to. I accept.

1255
01:33:21,762 --> 01:33:24,222
- You do?
- Yes, I do.

1256
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:32,355
NORMAN:
Oliver, we're gonna get married.

1257
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:38,445
I guess I didn't read that line right.
I'll try again.

1258
01:33:40,281 --> 01:33:42,365
We're going to get married.

1259
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:45,827
- Both of us.
- To each other. What do you think of that?

1260
01:33:45,995 --> 01:33:47,370
What's the matter?

1261
01:33:47,538 --> 01:33:50,582
He's trying to decide
if it's good for the studio.

1262
01:33:51,792 --> 01:33:53,960
Well, is it?

1263
01:33:54,128 --> 01:33:56,963
- It is. My blessings.
- Thank you.

1264
01:33:57,131 --> 01:33:58,632
A little unsteady, but thank you.

1265
01:33:58,799 --> 01:34:00,467
LIBBY: Congratulations.
- Thank you, Libby.

1266
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:02,719
How long a honeymoon
are you going to give us?

1267
01:34:02,887 --> 01:34:04,471
OLIVER:
Now, let's see.

1268
01:34:05,348 --> 01:34:07,682
I'll want you back by the ninth.

1269
01:34:07,850 --> 01:34:08,892
No, make it the tenth.

1270
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:11,519
Now, don't let your heart run away
with your head.

1271
01:34:11,687 --> 01:34:15,649
I'll have to call Production and see how
long I can stall off Vicki's wardrobe tests.

1272
01:34:15,816 --> 01:34:20,278
While you're settling the details, is it
all right if I go out and buy the lady a ring?

1273
01:34:20,446 --> 01:34:22,155
Sure, we want everything legal.

1274
01:34:22,323 --> 01:34:24,074
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1275
01:34:24,241 --> 01:34:26,159
Bye, Oliver.

1276
01:34:26,744 --> 01:34:28,411
ESTHER: Goodbye, Libby.
NORMAN: Bye. Bye, Libby.

1277
01:34:30,456 --> 01:34:34,167
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

1278
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:39,005
That was quite a decision
you made just now, Oliver.

1279
01:34:39,173 --> 01:34:41,091
Decision?

1280
01:34:42,593 --> 01:34:45,303
Letting that girl walk into a booby trap.

1281
01:34:45,471 --> 01:34:47,180
Vicki's business is her own.

1282
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:48,890
Is it?

1283
01:34:49,475 --> 01:34:53,103
She's the hottest piece of property
the studio has right now.

1284
01:34:53,437 --> 01:34:55,980
This might make the difference
to Norman.

1285
01:34:56,524 --> 01:34:58,191
This might be it.

1286
01:34:58,859 --> 01:35:00,777
Any bets?

1287
01:35:02,863 --> 01:35:05,490
Well, I better start the wheels grinding.

1288
01:35:05,658 --> 01:35:08,868
A front-page splash on the wedding
would help his slipping box office.

1289
01:35:09,036 --> 01:35:11,746
Hello, this is Matt Libby.
Get me my office.

1290
01:35:12,289 --> 01:35:14,332
MARKHAM: Mr. Libby's office.
- Hello. Hello, Markham?

1291
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:18,336
- Yes, Mr. Libby.
- Lester and Maine are getting married.

1292
01:35:18,504 --> 01:35:21,297
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now, look, I want all stops pulled.

1293
01:35:21,465 --> 01:35:24,467
Full coverage, every department.
The wedding to end all weddings.

1294
01:35:24,635 --> 01:35:26,886
- Yes, sir.
- All right. Now, see if you can get...

1295
01:35:27,054 --> 01:35:30,140
...the mayor to close school that afternoon.
I'll get you the date.

1296
01:35:30,307 --> 01:35:32,892
Get newsreel and television coverage
started right away.

1297
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:38,022
Yeah. Get all traffic routed out of Beverly
Hills for two miles each side of the church.

1298
01:35:38,190 --> 01:35:39,232
Which one?

1299
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:43,361
The big one. And tell the Life, the TIME,
the AP and the UP boys...

1300
01:35:43,529 --> 01:35:47,991
...that I'll set up restricted coverage
with each one of them, personally.

1301
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:50,952
Yeah. The bleachers and everything.
The full treatment.

1302
01:35:52,246 --> 01:35:54,289
MAN: Now, if any man can show just cause
why these two...

1303
01:35:54,457 --> 01:35:59,252
...may not be lawfully joined together,
let him now speak or else hereafter...

1304
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:02,088
...forever hold his peace.

1305
01:36:03,424 --> 01:36:08,428
Do you, Ernest Sidney Gubbins,
take this woman for your wedded wife?

1306
01:36:08,596 --> 01:36:09,637
I do.

1307
01:36:09,805 --> 01:36:13,099
MAN: Will you love, comfort, honor
and keep her in sickness and in health...

1308
01:36:13,267 --> 01:36:14,893
...as long as you both shall live?

1309
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:16,227
I will.

1310
01:36:16,395 --> 01:36:21,357
Do you, Esther Blodgett,
take this man for your wedded husband?

1311
01:36:21,525 --> 01:36:24,652
- I do.
MAN: Will you obey, serve, love, honor...

1312
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:28,281
...and keep him in sickness and in health
as long as you both shall live?

1313
01:36:28,449 --> 01:36:32,994
- I will.
- Now, place the ring on her finger.

1314
01:36:35,289 --> 01:36:37,457
By virtue of the powers vested in me...

1315
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:40,376
...as justice of peace
of San Verdo township...

1316
01:36:40,544 --> 01:36:45,799
...county of Los Angeles,
I pronounce you man and wife.

1317
01:36:50,054 --> 01:36:51,763
- Good luck.
- Hooray!

1318
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:57,811
I must exercise my prerogatives of office.

1319
01:36:59,146 --> 01:37:01,356
I wish you all the happiness, miss.

1320
01:37:01,524 --> 01:37:02,690
Thank you so much.

1321
01:37:02,858 --> 01:37:04,776
Same to you.

1322
01:37:04,944 --> 01:37:08,154
- And now, if you'll just sign this.
- Oh, yes.

1323
01:37:08,989 --> 01:37:13,576
You know, I'd swear
I'd seen you before, Mrs. Gubbins.

1324
01:37:13,744 --> 01:37:14,786
Oh, really?

1325
01:37:14,954 --> 01:37:19,666
Well, I think this is the first time
I've ever been in San Verdo.

1326
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:23,753
You know, your face looks familiar too,
Mr. Gubbins.

1327
01:37:25,172 --> 01:37:26,673
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

1328
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:28,466
Thank you.

1329
01:37:28,634 --> 01:37:30,677
Here's your receipt.

1330
01:37:31,887 --> 01:37:33,346
- Goodbye.
- Oh, goodbye.

1331
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:34,848
- Bye.
- Bye.

1332
01:37:35,015 --> 01:37:37,308
- Here.
- Thank you.

1333
01:37:37,476 --> 01:37:39,352
- I think we got by with it.
- It was close.

1334
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:42,021
That J.P. was just beginning
to remember us.

1335
01:37:42,189 --> 01:37:43,523
At least we got away from Libby.

1336
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:45,650
NORMAN:
Libby doesn't even know we left town.

1337
01:37:45,818 --> 01:37:47,610
DANNY:
All the luck.

1338
01:37:54,243 --> 01:37:58,371
Well, if you'll be kind enough to glance
between my shoulder blades...

1339
01:37:58,539 --> 01:38:00,039
...Mr. and Mrs. Gubbins...

1340
01:38:00,207 --> 01:38:03,084
...you'll find there a knife,
on its handle are your initials.

1341
01:38:03,252 --> 01:38:05,962
- Oh, now, don't be angry.
- It's been delightful seeing you.

1342
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:07,672
LIBBY: Wait! Wait a minute!
ESTHER: Goodbye!

1343
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,716
- I've got--
- Bye.

1344
01:38:14,054 --> 01:38:16,097
Well, I wish them joy.

1345
01:38:16,265 --> 01:38:18,683
Wait till they see the press.
It won't be so funny.

1346
01:38:18,851 --> 01:38:22,812
- They've a right to get married quietly.
- No, they haven't. He knows better.

1347
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:26,357
Mr. Public Nuisance could stand
some decent publicity for a change.

1348
01:38:26,525 --> 01:38:28,401
I've spent ten years covering up for him.

1349
01:38:28,569 --> 01:38:31,946
Killing bad stories, sucking up
to columnists to smooth away his insults.

1350
01:38:32,114 --> 01:38:36,576
Who do you think they'll blame for not
letting them cover this today? Him? No. Me.

1351
01:38:36,744 --> 01:38:38,411
I'll look just like a fool.

1352
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:41,331
Double-crossed by a cruddy actor.

1353
01:38:41,498 --> 01:38:44,792
Well, he needs this, believe me,
more than I do.

1354
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:46,753
Okay.

1355
01:38:47,087 --> 01:38:49,380
Just wait your turn, I always say.

1356
01:38:49,548 --> 01:38:51,966
What do you always say, McGuire?

1357
01:39:31,632 --> 01:39:32,799
Ooh.

1358
01:39:37,805 --> 01:39:41,641
Well, the first thing to do, I think...

1359
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:44,477
...is to go and wash your face.
It's quite dirty.

1360
01:39:44,645 --> 01:39:49,023
I know my face is dirty. But you didn't

Shall we...? Hm.
Shall we go through there?

You don't think someone'll come
strolling in...

1881

...and start telling us he's Napoleon
or Julius Caesar, do you?

1882
02:20:59,409 --> 02:21:01,243
No.

1883
02:21:01,953 --> 02:21:06,582
Nevertheless, I think we'd find it
a little cozier in the sun porch.

1884

Now, Cuddles, Mr. Niles isn't
slipping me a case of Scotch.

He's just gonna sit with me.

Oh, I'm coming along splendidly,
so Cuddles tells me.

02:21:30,982 --> 02:21:33,650
He says you ought to see
some of the boys.

Well, let's sit down.

1892

Cuddles, we really don't need you.

1893

Touching, isn't it?
He can't bear to have me out of his sight.

Well, you comfortable here?

1895
02:21:48,583 --> 02:21:52,211
Comfortable?
Why, it's positively luxurious.

1896
02:21:52,462 --> 02:21:57,216
Why, we even have steel mesh
on the windows to keep the drafts out.

only I'm just staying on...

Who plays opposite me?

1906
02:22:28,581 --> 02:22:32,209
Well, it isn't exactly the lead, Norman.
Young Pemberton's doing that.

1907
02:22:32,377 --> 02:22:35,671
But I'll tell you frankly,
I consider your part better than the lead.

1908
02:22:35,838 --> 02:22:38,257
I see. Better than the lead.

1909
02:22:38,424 --> 02:22:42,302
Of course, it isn't terribly long. It's one
of those parts that make an impression.

all through the picture.

that I'm pretty well set at another studio.

I'm not at liberty at the moment
to tell you which one.

You know yourself how those things are,
but it's big. Big.

As for the part, every actor in Hollywood...

1916
02:23:05,034 --> 02:23:09,538
- ...would give his eyeteeth to play it.
- That's fine, Norman. Just fine.

1917
02:23:10,456 --> 02:23:13,333
Naturally, that'll tie you up for a while.

William Gregory.

2032
02:30:43,993 --> 02:30:46,619
MAN: Drunk. Picked up at Fifth
and Towne asleep in the gutter.

2033
02:30:46,787 --> 02:30:49,330
Fourteen similar offenses
in the past six months.

2034
02:30:49,790 --> 02:30:51,708
How do you plead?

2035
02:30:51,876 --> 02:30:53,376
I don't feel so good.

2036
02:30:53,544 --> 02:30:56,337
I didn't ask you how you feel.
I said how do you plead?

2037
02:30:56,505 --> 02:30:57,881
Guilty, I guess.

2038
02:30:58,049 --> 02:31:00,216
When did you get out the last time?

2039
02:31:00,384 --> 02:31:01,551
Just before Christmas.

2040
02:31:02,636 --> 02:31:05,055
You'll have to miss New Year's,
but you'll be out...

2041
02:31:05,222 --> 02:31:08,600
...in time for Washington's birthday.
Sixty days.

2042

into tree at Sunset and Coronado.

2045
02:31:19,820 --> 02:31:21,404
Evidently been drinking for days.

2046
02:31:21,572 --> 02:31:25,075
Resisted arrest and injured
one of the arresting officers.

2047
02:31:25,242 --> 02:31:26,785
How do you plead?

2048
02:31:26,952 --> 02:31:28,703
Guilty.

2049

Were you Norman Maine, the actor?

2050

Yes.

And look what you've done with them.

2054
02:31:44,887 --> 02:31:48,139
You're nothing but an irresponsible drunk
driving around the streets...

2055
02:31:48,307 --> 02:31:52,102
...with the power to inflict death
and injury on innocent people.

2056
02:31:52,269 --> 02:31:57,899
I think we'd better deny you that power
for a while. Ninety days in the city jail.

2057
02:32:06,575 --> 02:32:07,867
I'm his wife.

2058

I recognize you, Miss Lester.

Please, judge, I promise...

2060
02:32:14,834 --> 02:32:19,003
...this will never, never happen again.

2061
02:32:19,171 --> 02:32:21,631
I'll be responsible for him.

2062
02:32:21,799 --> 02:32:23,550
I will.

2063

If you'll just not send him there.

2064

JUDGE: Do you realize that this man,
when drunk...

2065
02:32:30,474 --> 02:32:32,725
...is obviously a menace
to the public's safety?

2066
02:32:35,688 --> 02:32:39,649
Do you realize, too, the responsibility
you'll be assuming in this, to the court...

2067
02:32:39,817 --> 02:32:41,568
...and to the people of this city?

Sentence suspended.
Prisoner remanded to custody of wife.

- Good.

2076
02:34:59,123 --> 02:35:00,748
He's been sleeping most of the day.

2077
02:35:00,916 --> 02:35:03,251
- That's the best thing for him.
- Yes.

2078
02:35:06,547 --> 02:35:10,174
He looks so helpless lying there.

2079
02:35:10,801 --> 02:35:15,638
Smiling in his sleep, just like a child.

I'm very fond of both of you.

ESTHER: Then I know you'll understand
what I have to tell you.

You probably know already,
after what happened last night.

2089
02:35:53,427 --> 02:35:56,512
I can't do any more pictures, Oliver.

2090
02:35:57,264 --> 02:35:59,849

2092
02:36:03,312 --> 02:36:06,022
You're at the very height
of your career, Esther.

2093
02:36:06,190 --> 02:36:08,775
The very peak of your success.

2094
02:36:09,318 --> 02:36:12,111
There wouldn't be any career
without Norman.

2095
02:36:12,738 --> 02:36:15,365
I'm just giving back the gift he gave me.

...by his faith and by his love.

2100
02:36:28,045 --> 02:36:31,297
And without him, it's just nothing.

02:36:31,715 --> 02:36:34,175
Not the way things are.

2102
02:36:34,343 --> 02:36:36,386

- Mm-hm.

02:36:38,555 --> 02:36:40,390
What'll you do?

2105
02:36:40,682 --> 02:36:44,143
Well, we'll go away together.

2106
02:36:44,311 --> 02:36:47,397
I'll be with him every moment.

2107
02:36:47,564 --> 02:36:50,066
Maybe if I'd had a chance
to be with him more...

2108
02:36:50,234 --> 02:36:53,069
...some of these things
wouldn't have happened.

2109
02:36:54,446 --> 02:36:57,156
I've got to hang onto that.

2110
02:36:57,491 --> 02:36:59,492
I've got to believe that.

2111
02:36:59,660 --> 02:37:02,745
And then when he gets better...

2112
02:37:03,038 --> 02:37:06,999
...we can work in England or Italy.

2113
02:37:07,960 --> 02:37:13,923
Somewhere where they don't know
about him the way they do here.

2114
02:37:14,800 --> 02:37:19,762
And he can get a chance to start again.
That's all he needs.

2115
02:37:20,097 --> 02:37:22,348
That's what I'm willing to fight for.

2116

To give anything for.

2118
02:37:28,230 --> 02:37:30,148
...I have to tell you this.

I hate to, but I must.

There's nothing left anymore.

2121

Long before we let him out of the studio.

2122
02:37:41,326 --> 02:37:46,456
Twenty years of steady and quiet drinking
do something to a man.

2123
02:37:46,957 --> 02:37:50,126
Long before it showed in his face,
it showed in his acting.

2124
02:37:50,294 --> 02:37:54,213
Little by little, more and more,
with each picture.

2125
02:37:54,381 --> 02:37:56,007
That's why he slipped.

2126
02:37:56,175 --> 02:37:59,135
It wasn't just bad pictures, it was him.

2127
02:37:59,344 --> 02:38:02,305
And there's nothing left anymore.

2128
02:38:02,473 --> 02:38:05,641
He's just the shell of what he once was.
It's gone, Esther.

No. No, Oliver, I don't believe that.
I won't and I can't.

Can you honestly tell me
I'm wrong to do this?

To try? To try?

No, my dear, I can't.
I can't honestly tell you that.
