1
00:01:08,548 --> 00:01:11,210
Come dear.

2
00:01:11,284 --> 00:01:13,684
Let me tell you a story.

3
00:01:13,754 --> 00:01:19,215
''There was a old house
in Lokhandwala, Mumbai.''

4
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:26,390
''Basera. Here lived Granny,
Sunil, Sunita, Anjali..''

5
00:01:26,466 --> 00:01:28,491
..a lot of children
and their uncle Adi.



52
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:30,703
l have now assumed your name.

53
00:05:32,545 --> 00:05:37,209
All in my love.

54
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:41,617
All in my love.

55
00:05:41,688 --> 00:05:46,955
All in my love.

56
00:05:48,294 --> 00:05:51,229
''What's in my eyes
all day and night?''

57
00:05:51,297 --> 00:05:54,824
What's it? What's it?

58
00:05:54,901 --> 00:06:00,601
''One face, only one face,
that's your face.''

59
00:06:05,011 --> 00:06:08,174
''What's in my
heartbeat all day and night?''

60
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:11,706
What's it? What's it?

61
00:06:11,785 --> 00:06:17,246
''Your thought, your
memory and only you.''

62
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:22,058
You are the soul of my dreams.

63
00:06:22,128 --> 00:06:24,255
Only you are acceptable to me.

64
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:29,131
''The pleasure of my eyes,
l'm now in pieces.''

65
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:33,536
All in your love.

66
00:06:33,606 --> 00:06:38,543
All in your love.

67
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:51,555
Fantastic!
- Adi! - No problem.

68
00:06:51,624 --> 00:06:54,286
Tell Chopra to take the car.
lt will race with the winds.

69
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,555
This car is as good as a new baby.

70
00:06:56,629 --> 00:07:00,087
Adi! lt is you who has to Race
against the wind. - Meaning?

71
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,100
There are 10 missed calls
and all from the menace.

72
00:07:02,168 --> 00:07:05,831
Oh! Shit!

73
00:07:05,905 --> 00:07:08,305
What happened?
- lt is Chandu's birthday today.

74
00:07:25,024 --> 00:07:27,584
What happened?
- He is not picking up the phone.

75
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,993
l will never forgive uncle.

76
00:07:31,064 --> 00:07:35,797
l will grow up and beat
him up. Let's cut the cake.

77
00:07:54,888 --> 00:07:59,348
When will uncle come?
- Let's cut the cake.

78
00:07:59,425 --> 00:08:00,790
Where is sister Priya?

79
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,693
Sister Priya!
- What's it?

80
00:08:03,763 --> 00:08:05,196
Let's cut the cake.

81
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:08,063
But your uncle was
going to get the cake.

82
00:08:08,134 --> 00:08:10,796
That late Kate? We new that
he will never make it on time.

83
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,168
That's why we bought
the cake ourselves.

84
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:16,640
Duffers! He must be
stuck in a meeting.

85
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:18,233
He must be on his way.

86
00:08:18,311 --> 00:08:20,677
No!

87
00:08:20,747 --> 00:08:23,875
'May you live for a thousand years.'

88
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,077
''Bahadur, you've gone crazy.''

89
00:08:26,152 --> 00:08:29,644
'May this day come again
and again.' - Bhahadur.

90
00:08:29,722 --> 00:08:32,748
'May this heart sing out
again and again.' - Bhahadur!

91
00:08:32,826 --> 00:08:35,090
Always keeps singing.

92
00:08:35,161 --> 00:08:37,254
''Bahadur, you've to sing in tune.''

93
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,094
Bahadur.
- Who called me?

94
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:42,259
Did the box talk?

95
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:44,394
Bhahadur!
- Sorry sir.

96
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,937
What's the situation inside?

97
00:08:46,673 --> 00:08:50,404
Shall l blow it out? - Hey! l am
coming. - Let me put it first.

98
00:08:52,345 --> 00:08:53,676
''Hey, tigers.''

99
00:08:55,682 --> 00:08:57,172
Oh yeah!

100
00:09:01,187 --> 00:09:03,052
My tyre blew up.

101
00:09:03,122 --> 00:09:08,150
''Come on, take out
the money. Hey! Wow!''

102
00:09:08,228 --> 00:09:09,422
What's happening?

103
00:09:09,495 --> 00:09:12,692
They had a bet on
what excuse you'll give.

104
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:16,701
l was stuck with a client.- l
couldn't come out of the meeting.

105
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:19,863
l slept off in the office.
- There was no spare time.

106
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:22,237
There was a big traffic jam.

107
00:09:22,308 --> 00:09:24,833
my tyre blew up.

108
00:09:24,911 --> 00:09:27,812
He guessed the right
excuse so he won the bet.

109
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:31,707
''Okay, buddies.''

110
00:09:31,784 --> 00:09:34,446
l am Sorry.

111
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,021
''One, two, three, four.''

112
00:09:39,092 --> 00:09:42,391
Happy birthday to you.

113
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:45,727
Happy birthday to you.

114
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:49,165
Happy birthday to dear Chandu.

115
00:09:49,235 --> 00:09:52,329
Happy birthday to you.

116
00:09:52,405 --> 00:09:53,895
Attack!

117
00:09:53,973 --> 00:09:57,272
Today is Chandu's birthday
and you're sitting here.

118
00:09:57,343 --> 00:10:00,437
''Sunita, don't bother me.
Am l not celebrating too?''

119
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:03,038
You can go there and
celebrate with everyone.

120
00:10:03,116 --> 00:10:05,380
lf l drink before everyone
you'll feel dishonoured.

121
00:10:05,451 --> 00:10:07,282
Then don't drink.
- Go away from here.

122
00:10:07,353 --> 00:10:08,945
Why don't you..
- Go away. - Daughter-in-law.

123
00:10:09,022 --> 00:10:12,458
Why are you indulging with him
when he doesn't listen to you?

124
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,991
''Happy Birthday.
- Uncle, come along and be with us.''

125
00:10:17,063 --> 00:10:22,365
Happy birthday. No. l'll sit there.

126
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:25,165
l'll sit there.
- Shweta come on fast.

127
00:10:38,484 --> 00:10:40,247
''Good evening, Mr. Harish.''

128
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,414
The children are
playing musical chairs there.

129
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:46,524
You seem to be playing
musical chairs with me here.

130
00:10:46,592 --> 00:10:50,084
''No, l'm not doing that.
- Yes.''

131
00:10:50,163 --> 00:10:51,790
When you sold me your house..

132
00:10:51,864 --> 00:10:54,355
..you also took
advance for this house.

133
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:59,802
You told me that they will
agree to sell their house as it is.

134
00:10:59,872 --> 00:11:03,808
They haven't agreed yet.
What's the secret?

135
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:06,811
l need some time.
- Time?

136
00:11:07,146 --> 00:11:15,144
l didn't become a builder
to build small colonies.

137
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:21,055
l want to earn money
every moment of time.

138
00:11:21,561 --> 00:11:23,358
That's why l can't remain idle.

139
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:28,858
Those who are idle are
the enemies of the country.

140
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:33,837
An enemy of the
country is my enemy too.

141
00:11:33,906 --> 00:11:35,464
lndia is my country.

142
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,975
Every lndian is my
brother and sister.

143
00:11:38,044 --> 00:11:40,069
l love my country.
- Shut up.

144
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:45,913
Give me one week's time.

145
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:48,244
What will happen in one week?

146
00:11:50,857 --> 00:11:54,987
l have selected a
groom for Adi's sister.

147
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:05,133
How many of them will be there?

148
00:12:05,204 --> 00:12:07,866
Two. Prabhakar and his son Rohit.

149
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,431
They will be two and we are so many.

150
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,239
That will be injustice.

151
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:14,609
We ate your food.

152
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:16,875
Shut up.

153
00:12:17,884 --> 00:12:19,875
Tomorrow a boy is
coming to see Anjali.

154
00:12:19,952 --> 00:12:23,945
None of you should appear
before him. - Why? Does he bite?

155
00:12:26,426 --> 00:12:28,951
l said shut up.
- No!

156
00:12:31,898 --> 00:12:36,358
Anjali is my niece but she
is more than a daughter to me.

157
00:12:36,436 --> 00:12:38,996
We love each other a lot.

158
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:42,906
Great! lt is rare to see
such joint families these days.

159
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:47,240
What is Anjali's qualification?

160
00:12:47,313 --> 00:12:50,146
B.com. She has also done
a course on computers.

161
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:53,652
For the last one year she is working
in a private firm. - Very good.

162
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:55,414
l must say that you're lucky.

163
00:12:58,224 --> 00:13:00,658
She will keep you very happy.

164
00:13:00,726 --> 00:13:05,129
l mean very.. Go away.
- What?

165
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:09,658
''Eat, l mean.. eat something.
- No.''

166
00:13:11,737 --> 00:13:15,229
''Quiet, all of you.
- One minute.''

167
00:13:15,942 --> 00:13:18,672
l have seen the boy.

168
00:13:20,012 --> 00:13:22,572
How is he to look at?
- Handsome.

169
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:29,382
l'm going?
- Where? - To see the boy.

170
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:32,447
Why are you so impatient?
- lt is my marriage.

171
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:35,153
Where are you going?
- To meet the boy.

172
00:13:35,228 --> 00:13:38,163
Girls have become
shameless these days. - Why?

173
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:40,699
''l thought that you'll tell me,
l don't want to marry''.''

174
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:42,958
Then l would cajole
you by saying that..

175
00:13:43,035 --> 00:13:45,595
..girls are the ones
who have to get married..

176
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:47,696
..and go away and all
that blah blah. etc.

177
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:49,172
Go away? My foot.

178
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:54,003
l will marry only on the condition
that l stay here after marriage.

179
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,377
Do we have to bear with
you after marriage too?

180
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:59,976
Okay. l don't want to marry at all.
- One minute. - Listen.

181
00:14:00,052 --> 00:14:01,417
''No, l will not marry''

182
00:14:01,487 --> 00:14:04,456
Are you sure?
- Yes. - 100 - Yes.

183
00:14:04,524 --> 00:14:06,287
Then l'll tell them that
she doesn't want to marry.

184
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:07,986
Not a bad idea.
- Brother! - What happened?

185
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,994
Why do you always take me seriously?

186
00:14:10,062 --> 00:14:13,998
Now come.
- Where? - You! C'mon brother!

187
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:16,728
Oh yeah!
- Yeah!

188
00:14:16,802 --> 00:14:20,431
Now come.
- Here comes our daughter.

189
00:14:29,015 --> 00:14:32,746
This is not Anjali.
This is not Rohit.

190
00:14:35,021 --> 00:14:38,320
''Come on, Mr. Prabhakar
let us leave them alone.''

191
00:14:38,391 --> 00:14:41,519
Let me show you the house.
- Come on.

192
00:14:42,028 --> 00:14:44,462
My house is also nearby.

193
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:48,022
'The moment you leave the house.'
- Bahadur!

194
00:14:49,101 --> 00:14:53,333
'The moment you..
- My master is like this.

195
00:15:05,318 --> 00:15:09,687
How are you?
- l'm fine.

196
00:15:09,755 --> 00:15:14,055
How are you?
- Fine.

197
00:15:15,628 --> 00:15:18,495
You haven't had anything.
Take something.

198
00:15:18,564 --> 00:15:24,059
''No, it's alright. Why
don't you take something?''

199
00:15:24,136 --> 00:15:27,333
First you do so and then l will.

200
00:15:27,406 --> 00:15:29,271
Please have something.

201
00:15:29,342 --> 00:15:30,775
First it has to be you.

202
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:40,448
l had sold my property
which was to a builder.

203
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:44,285
This is what l'm suggesting to..
- Uncle please. Not today.

204
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:51,155
''Listen, Adi. l'm telling this to
you frankly. Don't mistake me.''

205
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,690
These days girls don't like
to live in joint families.

206
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:58,293
That's why l have
bought A flat for Rohit.

207
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:03,308
The total estimate is 1
crore including the interiors.

208
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:07,743
l have arranged for
fifty and the balance fifty..

209
00:16:07,813 --> 00:16:10,839
Okay. l'll give the balance fifty.

210
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,110
Good!

211
00:16:12,184 --> 00:16:16,484
So 25 before engagement
and 25 before marriage.

212
00:16:16,922 --> 00:16:20,517
Ok.
- Good bye. - Bye.

213
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:25,863
ls this the way
Prabhakar should speak?

214
00:16:25,931 --> 00:16:28,456
ls fifty lakhs a small amount?

215
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:31,196
We shall refuse this alliance.
We will find some other alliance.

216
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,670
''No uncle, it is alright.''

217
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:35,866
But how will you get
such a large amount?

218
00:16:35,941 --> 00:16:37,636
We'll do something.

219
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,644
How can we get 25
lakhs in such a short time?

220
00:16:40,846 --> 00:16:46,876
''Vicky, that 32 lakhs that you
withdrew and invested in property.''

221
00:16:46,952 --> 00:16:48,817
''Adi, the market is down.''

222
00:16:49,822 --> 00:16:52,882
lt will take 3
months for it to improve.

223
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,894
3Months. Are you sure about that?
- Of course!

224
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:03,658
Then l will borrow from
the market for that period.

225
00:17:04,236 --> 00:17:06,898
l will have to mortgage the house.

226
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:09,566
''Read it carefully, son.''

227
00:17:09,642 --> 00:17:11,166
The date for repaying the ..

228
00:17:11,243 --> 00:17:13,473
..money is after 4
months on 1 7th December.

229
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:20,614
Take this sir. These
are the house papers.

230
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:25,248
Here is 25 lakh rupees for you.

231
00:17:37,636 --> 00:17:40,935
But what was the hurry
for this. These days..

232
00:17:41,006 --> 00:17:42,200
''Never mind, uncle.
What's the difference..''

233
00:17:42,274 --> 00:17:43,639
..if l pay today or tomorrow?

234
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:47,907
Fine. Can we have the
engagement on 15th next month?

235
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,948
As you please.
- Have something. - Thanks

236
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,708
''Mr. Hirachand, it's you!''

237
00:17:58,824 --> 00:18:01,520
First share and then cut.

238
00:18:02,495 --> 00:18:07,364
What to do? Money begets money.

239
00:18:08,534 --> 00:18:10,968
Here is the
agreement of Aditya Verma.

240
00:18:11,237 --> 00:18:13,637
And these are his house papers.

241
00:18:15,408 --> 00:18:17,308
ls this full 50 lakhs?

242
00:18:19,245 --> 00:18:21,236
''What are you thinking, Mr. Harish?''

243
00:18:22,314 --> 00:18:25,806
lf you don't mind can l
say something Mr. Hirachand.

244
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:28,980
This deal of yours
will cause you great loss.

245
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:32,991
You bought documents Worth
Rs.25 lacs by paying 50 lakhs.

246
00:18:33,893 --> 00:18:36,521
l know my nephew Adi very well.

247
00:18:36,662 --> 00:18:42,328
He will do something or the
other and repay his loan. - Maqbool!

248
00:18:45,271 --> 00:18:47,501
He is Mr. Maqbool Kalam.

249
00:18:47,573 --> 00:18:49,803
The main artist of
the stamp paper scam.

250
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,274
l see!

251
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:56,680
Yes.
- Thank you my friend.

252
00:18:58,284 --> 00:19:00,479
''Mr. Harish, give me the file.''

253
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:05,280
Now tell me which
signature is the real one.

254
00:19:07,893 --> 00:19:11,989
lncredible! l can't believe it.

255
00:19:16,101 --> 00:19:19,298
Adi is under the wrong
assumption that the date..

256
00:19:19,371 --> 00:19:22,465
..for repaying the loan is 1 7th ..

257
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:28,036
..December whereas it
is 1 7th October now.

258
00:19:28,113 --> 00:19:30,479
After 2 months that
mansion will be mine.

259
00:19:36,889 --> 00:19:40,848
Now l don't need these two.
- These two?

260
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:44,057
Yes. One!

261
00:19:47,132 --> 00:19:48,326
Two!

262
00:19:54,473 --> 00:19:57,374
The enemy of the
country is my enemy.

263
00:19:58,911 --> 00:20:01,846
lndia is my country.

264
00:20:02,348 --> 00:20:05,875
All lndians are my
brothers and sisters.

265
00:20:05,985 --> 00:20:08,385
Have you noticed the time?

266
00:20:08,454 --> 00:20:10,820
We are going to see better times?

267
00:20:11,423 --> 00:20:13,721
''When morning comes, this car
will fly faster than the wind.''

268
00:20:14,927 --> 00:20:16,792
That will be power of this car.

269
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:22,563
Why is the sir driving like this?

270
00:20:22,635 --> 00:20:25,365
Children come.

271
00:20:25,437 --> 00:20:30,033
New car! New car! New car! New car!

272
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:31,536
Okay.

273
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,976
Do you know who made this car?
- Who?

274
00:20:34,046 --> 00:20:35,980
Uncle!

275
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,883
Do you know on what
this new car runs?

276
00:20:40,953 --> 00:20:44,719
You think we are mad?
Petrol of course!

277
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:48,123
''No, buddy. This car
runs on solar energy.''

278
00:20:48,193 --> 00:20:50,127
Solar energy? What is that?

279
00:20:50,396 --> 00:20:53,388
Solar energy means
the rays of the sun.

280
00:20:53,465 --> 00:20:58,926
New Pinch
- Listen to me.

281
00:20:59,004 --> 00:21:00,130
''Don't joke, son.''

282
00:21:00,205 --> 00:21:01,900
''l'm not joking, grandma. Seriously.''

283
00:21:01,974 --> 00:21:03,839
l have a meeting
with GM Motors tomorrow.

284
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:07,436
lf my patent sells
then we are gonna be rich!

285
00:22:06,605 --> 00:22:11,668
''ln the path of life we
shall share our pains together.''

286
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:16,681
''Be it misery or joy we
shall share it all together.''

287
00:22:21,286 --> 00:22:26,223
''lf l get someone like you then
my job will be done, dearest.''

288
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:36,229
''lf l get someone like you then
my job will be done, dearest.''

289
00:22:40,973 --> 00:22:46,240
''ln the path of life we
shall share our pains together.''

290
00:22:46,311 --> 00:22:51,248
''Be it misery or joy we
shall share it all together.''

291
00:22:51,617 --> 00:22:57,681
''lf l get someone like you then
my job will be done, dearest.''

292
00:23:01,527 --> 00:23:07,523
''lf l get someone like you then
my job will be done, dearest.''

293
00:23:32,224 --> 00:23:37,059
''Such a bond of
friendship can be seen nowhere.''

294
00:23:37,129 --> 00:23:41,828
''We shall lay our
lives for each other.''

295
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,928
''We are to live together
and we are to die together.''

296
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:51,874
''This world will learn from
us how to love one another.''

297
00:23:51,944 --> 00:23:56,847
''Every step that we take
shall be together forever.''

298
00:23:56,915 --> 00:24:01,978
''Be it misery or joy we
shall share it all together.''

299
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:07,991
''lf l get someone like you then
my job will be done, dearest.''

300
00:24:11,864 --> 00:24:18,326
''lf l get someone like you then
my job will be done, dearest.''

301
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:27,877
Yeah!
- Yeah!

302
00:24:28,413 --> 00:24:30,608
Order! order!
- Shut up.

303
00:24:30,682 --> 00:24:36,279
This is so good. But this
would have come expensive.

304
00:24:36,355 --> 00:24:38,755
''Not as expensive as my
sister's expression, right?''

305
00:24:38,824 --> 00:24:41,349
Yeah!
- All right.

306
00:24:41,426 --> 00:24:45,988
What is this? Why have
you spread all the jewels?

307
00:24:46,632 --> 00:24:49,658
''Adi!
- Granny, marriage.''

308
00:24:49,735 --> 00:24:51,635
Not marriage but engagement.

309
00:24:51,703 --> 00:24:54,001
''More money will come, don't worry.''

310
00:24:54,072 --> 00:24:56,063
They will come? Has it come yet?

311
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:58,300
This way you'll be a pauper.

312
00:24:58,377 --> 00:25:00,641
''Have l become one yet? No, right?
- Right.''

313
00:25:00,712 --> 00:25:02,907
''Granny, why don't you choose?''

314
00:25:04,082 --> 00:25:06,380
Look..
- This one.

315
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,317
This one.
- Ok. - Wow!

316
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:17,090
Where is this one.
- Ok. - Wow!

317
00:25:19,898 --> 00:25:23,390
Wow!
- This is not for you. - Why?

318
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:26,661
This is for the daughter-in-law.
- Daughter-in-law?

319
00:25:26,738 --> 00:25:27,796
Priya.

320
00:25:29,474 --> 00:25:30,668
Come here.

321
00:25:32,077 --> 00:25:35,410
Are you alright?
- l'm fine. She is fit for you.

322
00:25:35,681 --> 00:25:40,914
''lmagine, if you're married you
will save a lot of money too. - What?''

323
00:25:40,986 --> 00:25:44,319
Life long free
tuitions for the children!

324
00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:46,414
Marriage.. and that too
with Priya? Ridiculous!

325
00:25:46,491 --> 00:25:51,986
lt is not ridiculous at all.
- Marriage! Marriage! - Shut up.

326
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:21,090
Hey!

327
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:33,429
What is all this?

328
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,764
What is all this?

329
00:26:35,841 --> 00:26:38,469
Meeting.
- What meeting?

330
00:26:38,543 --> 00:26:41,740
There is a discussion going on
between Priya's mummy and granny.

331
00:26:41,813 --> 00:26:43,940
What discussions?
- About marriage.

332
00:26:44,016 --> 00:26:46,416
Oh yeah!
- Yeah.

333
00:26:46,485 --> 00:26:48,350
Will he come to know.

334
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,480
My daughter has no objections.

335
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:54,354
The moment the bride's
people agree..

336
00:26:54,426 --> 00:26:56,360
..we will fix the
auspicious date. - Hi!

337
00:26:57,496 --> 00:27:00,954
What is all this without asking me?
- But Adi...

338
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:02,295
What is the hurry?

339
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:04,028
Marriage is something
that happens once in life.

340
00:27:04,102 --> 00:27:05,967
''But son, our
daughter has no objections.''

341
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:08,302
Yes.
- Why would she have objections?

342
00:27:08,373 --> 00:27:10,500
But mummy has already
finalised the proposal.

343
00:27:10,575 --> 00:27:12,907
''Granny, l don't agree to this.''

344
00:27:12,978 --> 00:27:15,310
But we have bought the
tickets to Bangalore.

345
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,847
lt makes no difference.

346
00:27:20,118 --> 00:27:21,847
But why Bangalore?

347
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,319
To meet the bride's people.

348
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:29,783
''Who do we have there, granny?
- My sister lives there.''

349
00:27:29,861 --> 00:27:31,294
She is the one who
initiated all the proposal.

350
00:27:31,363 --> 00:27:33,024
The boy is from America.

351
00:27:33,098 --> 00:27:34,531
l've brought the photo too.

352
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:35,896
See his photo.

353
00:27:38,403 --> 00:27:40,530
But what about the children's exams?

354
00:27:40,605 --> 00:27:44,974
''Don't worry, uncle. Priya has
finished our portions already.''

355
00:27:46,912 --> 00:27:48,504
lsn't he handsome?

356
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,344
He is very handsome.
- Not less than a hero.

357
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:52,440
''Yes, Shahrukh Khan.''

358
00:27:54,152 --> 00:27:58,088
lt is alright if
you all have decided.

359
00:27:59,825 --> 00:28:01,554
l'm leaving since l have some work.

360
00:28:02,961 --> 00:28:07,398
Ok. Bye-bye.

361
00:28:08,834 --> 00:28:11,564
O yeah!
- Yeah.

362
00:28:31,356 --> 00:28:32,846
Go and bring Adi.

363
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:35,517
''Uncle, come let us also play.''

364
00:28:35,594 --> 00:28:37,585
You play and don't bother me.

365
00:28:37,662 --> 00:28:39,254
''Please come, uncle.
- No.''

366
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:48,101
We shall win.

367
00:29:02,087 --> 00:29:04,612
What's wrong with you?

368
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:07,988
Why don't you go? Tigers will lose.

369
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,153
What difference does it make
to you? You go to Bangalore.

370
00:29:10,228 --> 00:29:12,253
''Don't act childish, now come on.''

371
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,890
Am l being childish?
Am l acting childish?

372
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:16,900
Did you ever think
that if you go away..

373
00:29:16,968 --> 00:29:18,299
..then what will happen to me.

374
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:19,894
Hire a new teacher.

375
00:29:19,971 --> 00:29:21,097
Just pick up someone from the road..

376
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:23,141
..and make her their aunt?
- Why?

377
00:29:28,914 --> 00:29:30,381
What?

378
00:29:31,283 --> 00:29:34,912
You call everyone a duffer
and you're the biggest duffer.

379
00:29:35,387 --> 00:29:36,911
Meaning?

380
00:29:39,724 --> 00:29:41,658
l love you.

381
00:29:45,931 --> 00:29:47,421
l love you too.

382
00:29:51,536 --> 00:29:52,662
Really?

383
00:29:52,737 --> 00:29:55,001
Then get going. They need you.

384
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:59,668
''l Love you.
- Love you too, duffer.''

385
00:30:00,946 --> 00:30:03,312
We're going to lose.

386
00:30:39,618 --> 00:30:42,382
''No use, uncle! We're going to lose.''

387
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:48,626
''Tigers never lose, okay?
- Okay.''

388
00:32:33,431 --> 00:32:37,390
Tigers!
- Shut up!

389
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:41,596
Oh yeah!
- Yeah.

390
00:32:43,108 --> 00:32:46,805
''Tanu! Granny, Tanu is beating me.''

391
00:32:46,878 --> 00:32:48,778
''Alright. Okay kids..
let's go to bed, it's late.''

392
00:32:48,847 --> 00:32:50,712
Five minutes.
- lt's ten and not five minutes.

393
00:32:50,782 --> 00:32:52,113
''No! Only five minutes, come on.''

394
00:32:52,183 --> 00:32:53,844
We just won a match and are you
going to party the whole night?

395
00:32:53,918 --> 00:32:55,180
What are you doing? Get to bed.

396
00:32:55,253 --> 00:32:57,847
Granny! What's happened Adi?
He seems to be hurrying everyone

397
00:32:57,922 --> 00:33:00,254
''Uncle, you aren't
letting me eat peacefully.''

398
00:33:00,325 --> 00:33:02,122
Shameless fellow! You're eating
for the third time. Have some shame.

399
00:33:02,193 --> 00:33:03,285
Uncle!

400
00:33:03,361 --> 00:33:05,352
Can we have enough
time for a cold drink?

401
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:08,866
No.
- Goodnight and enough. Go to bed.

402
00:33:09,134 --> 00:33:14,128
Chandu you.. Stop it. C'mon C'mon.

403
00:33:14,205 --> 00:33:15,729
''Granny, please take them in.''

404
00:33:15,807 --> 00:33:18,708
l said go to bed. Just
l said go to bed now.

405
00:33:18,777 --> 00:33:23,544
C'mon please come.
And you are come fast.

406
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:28,242
''Granny, what are you doing?''

407
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,548
Cleaning the table.

408
00:33:29,621 --> 00:33:30,747
Who will go for the
rehearsals early in the morning then?

409
00:33:30,822 --> 00:33:34,258
But this..
- We are here and will do it.

410
00:33:34,326 --> 00:33:36,886
Adi!
- Granny! Goodnight.

411
00:33:38,229 --> 00:33:40,163
What is she doing?

412
00:33:40,231 --> 00:33:41,789
Why has she not come in yet?

413
00:33:41,866 --> 00:33:42,890
Granny!

414
00:33:42,967 --> 00:33:45,527
What happened?

415
00:33:46,738 --> 00:33:49,901
l have left them both together.

416
00:33:53,178 --> 00:33:55,908
''Come granny, let's go
out and surprise them.''

417
00:34:10,995 --> 00:34:17,628
'Chandu's uncle and Chandu's
aunty kissed clandestinely.'

418
00:34:18,203 --> 00:34:20,364
That..

419
00:34:23,007 --> 00:34:25,942
''Granny since you said that,
we also thought..''

420
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:30,413
How can we disobey the elders?

421
00:34:30,482 --> 00:34:33,679
Okay. l understood it.

422
00:34:33,752 --> 00:34:37,779
Tomorrow morning we'll go to
Priya's parents to talk about this.

423
00:34:39,224 --> 00:34:40,418
Okay.

424
00:34:41,826 --> 00:34:43,851
You don't have to go to Bangalore.

425
00:34:43,928 --> 00:34:45,793
''Priya's aunty will
feel insulted, son.''

426
00:34:45,864 --> 00:34:48,264
No aunty. l have a
solution to avoid it.

427
00:34:49,434 --> 00:34:52,767
l was also planning to go
to America for a proposal.

428
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,968
We can do like this.

429
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,441
We will make that American
girl meet this American boy.

430
00:34:59,511 --> 00:35:01,240
Then there will be a
compromise between them.

431
00:35:02,514 --> 00:35:06,245
Then l am from Mumbai and
Priya is also from Mumbai.

432
00:35:06,317 --> 00:35:08,285
''No, this is not possible. Sorry.''

433
00:35:09,587 --> 00:35:12,249
''Mama, drop the act now. lt
has been stretched too far.''

434
00:35:12,323 --> 00:35:13,984
Okay.

435
00:35:14,793 --> 00:35:16,317
What do they say normally?

436
00:35:16,394 --> 00:35:20,524
l never dreamt that l'll
get such a good son-in-law.

437
00:35:21,266 --> 00:35:23,496
Thank you.

438
00:35:23,568 --> 00:35:25,729
Then let us fix the
date of the marriage.

439
00:35:25,804 --> 00:35:29,433
The day Anjali is getting engaged
we can have their engagement too.

440
00:35:29,507 --> 00:35:34,001
That's it. They have cut me off
and the settlement issue is on.

441
00:35:34,078 --> 00:35:35,545
Bunky!
- Bunky!

442
00:35:37,582 --> 00:35:39,948
l will introduce myself.

443
00:35:40,018 --> 00:35:45,820
''15 years ago, my father
and her husband were friends.''

444
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:49,488
Granny!
- Our marriage was settled then.

445
00:35:49,561 --> 00:35:54,430
''ln my childhood her husband went
to Dubai and my father, to heaven.''

446
00:35:54,499 --> 00:35:59,300
And 3 years ago they hoodwinked
me and came from Pune to here.

447
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:02,305
''Aunty, what nonsense is he talking?''

448
00:36:02,373 --> 00:36:03,840
l will tell you the
rest of the episode.

449
00:36:03,908 --> 00:36:06,741
Will l get Priya married to
this Bunky and spoil her life?

450
00:36:07,312 --> 00:36:08,370
He has always failed in school and..

451
00:36:08,446 --> 00:36:11,040
..has been in jail
for drug trafficking.

452
00:36:11,115 --> 00:36:14,881
Now all shackles are broken. Now
no one can separate me from Priya.

453
00:36:14,953 --> 00:36:18,354
''Come, Priya.
- One second, come here. Very good.''

454
00:36:19,757 --> 00:36:21,657
Have you ever noticed
your style of talking?

455
00:36:21,726 --> 00:36:23,318
Have you seen your
face in the mirror before?

456
00:36:23,394 --> 00:36:27,490
Only a mad person can give her
daughter in marriage to you.

457
00:36:27,565 --> 00:36:32,764
''So, Mr. Bunky, stop behaving
like a monkey and go back home.''

458
00:36:32,837 --> 00:36:34,862
What are you saying? Hey!

459
00:36:34,939 --> 00:36:39,000
Adi!
- Uncle! - l will back. Don't worry.

460
00:36:41,346 --> 00:36:43,041
Both of you come in.

461
00:36:44,349 --> 00:36:48,649
''Priya, come with me
quietly or else l'll kidnap you.''

462
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,950
Oh yeah?
- Yeah!

463
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,828
Anand Ray you seem to
love music. Learn the drum

464
00:37:03,368 --> 00:37:04,892
You think that you're a hero?

465
00:37:32,931 --> 00:37:36,389
''Mr. Harish, why are you
wearing out your sole?''

466
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:38,697
Come and sit down
and don't be tense.

467
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,397
How can l not be tense?

468
00:37:40,471 --> 00:37:44,100
Tomorrow is Adi's meeting. He
is going to get a huge amount.

469
00:37:44,175 --> 00:37:47,076
So what? Tomorrow is Friday.

470
00:37:48,012 --> 00:37:50,913
Adi will deposit the
cheque on Saturday.

471
00:37:50,982 --> 00:37:52,882
After that is Sunday.

472
00:37:52,951 --> 00:37:54,885
Monday there is a bank strike.

473
00:37:54,953 --> 00:37:56,784
On Tuesday there is
a religious festival.

474
00:37:56,854 --> 00:37:58,151
Then on Wednesday..

475
00:37:58,222 --> 00:37:59,655
That is of course irrelevant.

476
00:38:00,425 --> 00:38:02,586
ln two days that
agreement is going to expire.

477
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,753
Then that property is
going to be in my name.

478
00:38:05,096 --> 00:38:06,757
Because it is a legal document.

479
00:38:07,732 --> 00:38:12,601
The one who goes against the law
of the nation is the nation's enemy.

480
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:15,161
The enemy of the
nation is my enemy too.

481
00:38:16,774 --> 00:38:19,106
lndia is my country.

482
00:38:19,177 --> 00:38:21,668
Every lndian is my
brother and sister.

483
00:38:21,746 --> 00:38:23,179
l love my country.

484
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:29,115
What's going on? What's happening?

485
00:38:29,187 --> 00:38:32,679
l have to go to work.
What's going on?

486
00:38:32,757 --> 00:38:35,487
''ls today a very important day
in life for you? - Yes, so what?''

487
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,461
So we shall groom you today.
- No.

488
00:38:39,464 --> 00:38:41,125
What are doing pal!

489
00:38:44,502 --> 00:38:46,493
Who will put the trousers on me?

490
00:38:46,571 --> 00:38:50,098
''Uncle, you're not a kid.
Can't you wear it yourself?''

491
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,109
l'm late. Granny l'm going.

492
00:38:54,879 --> 00:38:56,005
One minute son.

493
00:39:00,952 --> 00:39:02,010
Live long.

494
00:39:04,088 --> 00:39:05,214
Have some curd.

495
00:39:09,827 --> 00:39:10,919
What are you looking at?

496
00:39:10,995 --> 00:39:13,486
Granny it is the
biggest deal in my life.

497
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:16,897
After today all our
problems will be over.

498
00:39:16,968 --> 00:39:18,492
Everything will be alright.

499
00:39:22,006 --> 00:39:24,998
Oh god! lts ten
thirty and l should leave.

500
00:39:26,177 --> 00:39:29,044
''What's this?
- My report card, you've to sign it.''

501
00:39:29,113 --> 00:39:30,171
Why didn't you show
it to me in the night?

502
00:39:30,248 --> 00:39:32,773
l'm a child and l can forget too.

503
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:33,908
l'll sign in the night.

504
00:39:33,985 --> 00:39:35,850
You want me to be
punished by the teacher?

505
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,012
Do it fast.

506
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,186
Why are the marks so low?

507
00:39:45,263 --> 00:39:48,061
''l was sick during the exams,
have you forgotten that?''

508
00:39:50,702 --> 00:39:55,571
Brother! All the best.
- Thank you.

509
00:39:57,608 --> 00:40:00,634
Sister in law. - Naughty.
All the best. - Thank you.

510
00:40:00,712 --> 00:40:04,204
''Bye, what's it now?
- Are you not forgetting something?''

511
00:40:04,282 --> 00:40:09,549
l'm not forgetting anything?
Thank you. Bye.

512
00:40:11,622 --> 00:40:15,217
Tigers!

513
00:40:18,229 --> 00:40:19,560
Have they gone to school so early?

514
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,892
Tigers.

515
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:28,933
What happened?
- l'm dead.

516
00:40:29,006 --> 00:40:34,774
Uncle has taken my file.
- What? Show me.

517
00:40:37,915 --> 00:40:39,314
This is Adi's meeting file.

518
00:40:43,755 --> 00:40:47,247
''Tigers. Hello.
- Adi. - Yes, granny.''

519
00:40:47,325 --> 00:40:49,020
''Son, what file have
you taken with you?''

520
00:40:49,093 --> 00:40:54,087
What happened? Oh shit!

521
00:40:54,165 --> 00:40:56,793
''Granny, send someone outside. l
will reach there in 2 minutes.''

522
00:41:11,015 --> 00:41:12,141
Don't cross the road.

523
00:41:13,718 --> 00:41:14,776
Stop!

524
00:41:16,287 --> 00:41:17,686
Uncle. l'm coming.

525
00:41:19,624 --> 00:41:21,615
Uncle!
- Don't cross the road.

526
00:41:27,365 --> 00:41:28,627
''Parth, don't.''

527
00:41:37,909 --> 00:41:39,035
Parth!

528
00:41:43,714 --> 00:41:46,308
Uncle!

529
00:41:50,388 --> 00:41:51,650
Uncle!

530
00:41:58,663 --> 00:42:00,324
Mr. Yamraj.

531
00:43:53,177 --> 00:43:54,303
Count down.

532
00:45:11,022 --> 00:45:15,118
There is nothing wrong with him.

533
00:45:15,192 --> 00:45:18,525
Remember in the childhood
his breath would suddenly stop.

534
00:45:18,596 --> 00:45:21,463
''Mother, calm yourself.''

535
00:45:21,532 --> 00:45:29,098
Please calm yourself. lf
you lose the balance then..

536
00:45:29,173 --> 00:45:30,868
..what will happen
to all these people?

537
00:45:40,217 --> 00:45:42,082
l will make the arrangements
for the cremation and come.

538
00:45:42,153 --> 00:45:45,020
Priya!

539
00:46:18,589 --> 00:46:20,386
Hi.
- Hi. Hello.

540
00:46:24,028 --> 00:46:25,962
Nice car.
- Thanks.

541
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:30,467
''925 Chevrolet, 4 cylinders
1800 cc. Well maintained.''

542
00:46:30,534 --> 00:46:32,525
You are teaching me about my car.

543
00:46:36,273 --> 00:46:37,365
Why is there so much smoke?

544
00:46:37,441 --> 00:46:39,204
Not smoke but clouds.

545
00:46:41,445 --> 00:46:45,677
''Are we going to some hill station?
- No, to the heaven.''

546
00:46:46,283 --> 00:46:47,477
Good joke.

547
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,146
You are dead.

548
00:46:55,159 --> 00:46:56,456
Good joke again.

549
00:46:58,229 --> 00:46:59,457
You have a good sense of humor.

550
00:47:02,032 --> 00:47:04,000
''You want to see. Look down.
- Yeah, sure.''

551
00:47:10,975 --> 00:47:12,033
How is that possible?

552
00:47:14,979 --> 00:47:16,105
l must be dreaming.

553
00:47:16,313 --> 00:47:18,508
Pinch me.

554
00:47:18,582 --> 00:47:19,640
Okay.

555
00:47:23,587 --> 00:47:28,047
This is not a dream?
- This is not a dream. You're dead.

556
00:47:30,661 --> 00:47:32,652
''Let me introduce myself, my boy.''

557
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:36,393
l'm Yamraj M.A.
- M.A?

558
00:47:36,467 --> 00:47:39,994
M. A. stands for 'Mauth Ka
Ayojak' (messenger of death).

559
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:41,367
Why are you joking?

560
00:47:41,438 --> 00:47:43,133
Tell me truth Please!

561
00:47:43,207 --> 00:47:45,368
First it also
appeared to me like that.

562
00:47:45,442 --> 00:47:47,069
He is serious.

563
00:47:49,413 --> 00:47:51,574
Who are you?
- l'm Shakti. l'm also dead.

564
00:47:54,752 --> 00:47:56,049
How is that possible?

565
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,678
His time was over.

566
00:48:01,225 --> 00:48:02,351
Look at this.

567
00:48:06,363 --> 00:48:08,297
This is you. This is your date..

568
00:48:08,365 --> 00:48:11,027
..of birth and this
is your date of death.

569
00:48:12,636 --> 00:48:14,501
And me? l'm the delivery man.

570
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:22,038
One second. l met with an
accident and.. - And you died.

571
00:48:26,383 --> 00:48:31,047
How can you kill me like that?
You should give some notice.

572
00:48:31,121 --> 00:48:33,715
l could've fallen
sick or bad health.

573
00:48:34,725 --> 00:48:36,625
l could've done
something for my family.

574
00:48:36,694 --> 00:48:38,059
Now what will happen
to them without me?

575
00:48:38,128 --> 00:48:40,221
This is none of my concern sir.

576
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:44,733
This was directed by Chitragupt.

577
00:48:50,674 --> 00:48:52,608
''No, you can't be
Yamraj (god of death)''

578
00:48:52,676 --> 00:48:54,667
Because l don't have big moustaches?

579
00:48:54,745 --> 00:48:56,076
l don't wear the crown
with horns and l don't wear..

580
00:48:56,146 --> 00:48:59,138
''..the dhoti, isn't it?
- Exactly.''

581
00:49:00,484 --> 00:49:04,113
That was the get up
in the ancient days.

582
00:49:07,291 --> 00:49:09,156
This is now 2005.

583
00:49:13,764 --> 00:49:16,198
Why are you driving a
Chevrolet car instead of a buffalo.

584
00:49:17,768 --> 00:49:19,702
Mr. Buffalo could you
show yourself please.

585
00:49:27,444 --> 00:49:28,502
Mr. Yamraj.
- Yes.

586
00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:31,571
Where is your mace?
- Where is it?

587
00:49:35,452 --> 00:49:37,113
Such a small one?

588
00:49:37,187 --> 00:49:38,381
Have patience my boy.

589
00:49:45,462 --> 00:49:48,488
How did you do that?
- Technology my boy.

590
00:49:58,342 --> 00:49:59,400
Where are the sounds coming from?

591
00:49:59,476 --> 00:50:04,743
We are going over hell.
- Hell? Can l have a look? - Look.

592
00:50:28,839 --> 00:50:30,170
Oh god!

593
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:36,612
What happened?
- That was so horrible.

594
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,843
They also did horrible things.

595
00:50:42,786 --> 00:50:48,918
Up. - Relax. - lt is
a mountain. - Relax.

596
00:51:01,538 --> 00:51:03,733
''We have reached
our destination, sir.''

597
00:51:17,755 --> 00:51:21,418
Let's go.
- l'll not come.

598
00:51:21,492 --> 00:51:27,226
But this is a good place.
- l'm worried about my family.

599
00:51:30,901 --> 00:51:33,768
''Mr. Yamraj, please let me go back.''

600
00:51:33,837 --> 00:51:35,771
You know l can't let you go.

601
00:51:37,341 --> 00:51:40,708
''Please, Mr. Yamraj, there is
no one else for my family.''

602
00:51:42,579 --> 00:51:44,308
l beg of you with folded hands.

603
00:51:45,749 --> 00:51:48,274
You don't understand. l
don't have the authority.

604
00:51:48,352 --> 00:51:52,789
Do you need that? You
are so strong. - l know.

605
00:51:52,856 --> 00:51:59,261
''But, no. - Please. Okay show me
what is happening in my house.''

606
00:51:59,329 --> 00:52:00,887
Okay as you wish.

607
00:52:06,937 --> 00:52:09,872
Sister Priya. ls not
everyone telling a lie?

608
00:52:11,942 --> 00:52:15,605
l know that nothing
has happened to uncle.

609
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:17,306
He will surely come back.

610
00:52:17,381 --> 00:52:19,576
He will give some excuse.

611
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:25,680
The tyre burst. - There was lot
of traffic. - This Vikram has..

612
00:52:25,756 --> 00:52:31,558
..become very lazy. l
have to do all the work.

613
00:52:31,628 --> 00:52:34,290
The bankers are
not giving the money.

614
00:52:34,364 --> 00:52:35,763
l slept of in the office.

615
00:52:35,833 --> 00:52:40,702
Sister Priya. Ring up uncle.

616
00:52:40,771 --> 00:52:41,931
l had rung him up.

617
00:52:42,005 --> 00:52:47,307
''We'll ring up again.
- Why are you telling lies, dear?''

618
00:52:47,377 --> 00:52:51,973
Your uncle has gone to such a..

619
00:52:52,049 --> 00:52:56,315
..place from where
no one can come back.

620
00:52:56,386 --> 00:52:59,878
''No, don't say like that.''

621
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:08,597
''No, l'll not break down. He
thinks that l'll break down.''

622
00:53:08,665 --> 00:53:10,530
''No, l'll not break down.''

623
00:53:10,601 --> 00:53:16,335
Granny. - Let me also see
how much pain he can give me.

624
00:53:16,406 --> 00:53:20,342
''Let me see, how much
hard hearted he can be.''

625
00:53:22,412 --> 00:53:25,813
Let me see how wicked he can be.

626
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,994
l can't see all these.
l'm an emotional man.

627
00:53:39,062 --> 00:53:43,362
Then help me out.
- What can l do?

628
00:53:43,433 --> 00:53:49,372
Send me down for some days.
- That only the god can do.

629
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:52,431
He has gone on an eight
days vacation with his wife.

630
00:53:52,509 --> 00:53:58,038
Vacation? Okay do like this.
Send me down for 7 days.

631
00:53:58,115 --> 00:53:59,582
''After that you can
bring me back here, please.''

632
00:54:05,455 --> 00:54:07,650
Okay l'll try and do something.

633
00:54:11,795 --> 00:54:12,989
l will go down and
set right everything.

634
00:54:13,063 --> 00:54:15,463
''Set right everything, okay?''

635
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,458
Thank you.

636
00:54:17,534 --> 00:54:23,063
One minute. No one can
see you or hear you..

637
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,630
..and so how will you do something.

638
00:54:24,708 --> 00:54:28,405
Why?
- You will go down as a spirit.

639
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:36,082
l know that you can do something.
Please do something.

640
00:54:36,153 --> 00:54:40,089
l will have to put
the life back in you.

641
00:54:40,157 --> 00:54:44,491
Then do it. - Are you mad?
l can't take that risk

642
00:54:44,561 --> 00:54:48,463
Then it's alright. l will
also not go. l'll remain here.

643
00:54:48,532 --> 00:54:52,093
l will not eat or
drink or do anything.

644
00:54:52,169 --> 00:54:55,605
''l will feed you with my own hands.
- No, l don't want it.''

645
00:54:55,672 --> 00:54:59,733
''You are making me emotional again.
- Then, what should l do?''

646
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:04,474
''My family, please help me. -Okay,
l'll do something.''

647
00:55:04,548 --> 00:55:07,449
What will you do?
- After 7 days l'll come down and..

648
00:55:07,517 --> 00:55:11,510
..give your life
back for only 5 minutes.

649
00:55:11,588 --> 00:55:15,080
What is the use of living only
for 5 minutes? l don't want it.

650
00:55:15,158 --> 00:55:16,455
Then 5 seconds?

651
00:55:16,526 --> 00:55:18,118
Then 5 minutes?
- Okay.

652
00:55:18,195 --> 00:55:21,460
''Okay, get ready for blast off.''

653
00:55:26,136 --> 00:55:28,969
''3,2,1''

654
00:55:35,946 --> 00:55:37,038
Why are you shouting?

655
00:55:37,114 --> 00:55:39,139
We will fall down and die.

656
00:55:39,216 --> 00:55:41,707
''ldiots, you both are already dead.''

657
00:55:43,654 --> 00:55:45,121
All the best. Happy landing.

658
00:56:02,506 --> 00:56:03,564
Come.

659
00:56:13,917 --> 00:56:15,509
''We are ghosts, come.''

660
00:56:30,534 --> 00:56:31,694
Oh god!

661
00:56:34,871 --> 00:56:37,601
How did this happen?
- You said it that we are ghosts.

662
00:56:37,674 --> 00:56:39,107
''Yes, we are ghosts.''

663
00:56:41,144 --> 00:56:42,611
Can we go now?
- Come.

664
00:56:55,025 --> 00:56:56,890
l'm a bad boy

665
00:56:58,228 --> 00:57:00,093
''lt is my fault, all of it.''

666
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:06,569
lf l had not given the file to him
for signing then he wouldn't be dead.

667
00:57:06,636 --> 00:57:07,967
''Sorry, uncle''

668
00:57:09,639 --> 00:57:10,901
Don't say like that.

669
00:57:11,041 --> 00:57:14,772
''Sister Priya, why did
god call back uncle?''

670
00:57:18,648 --> 00:57:22,584
He is playing a game with us.

671
00:57:23,653 --> 00:57:28,590
lt is like we play hide and seek.

672
00:57:28,925 --> 00:57:32,190
God has hidden your uncle from us.

673
00:57:32,329 --> 00:57:34,593
What we will do is
that we will pretend.

674
00:57:34,664 --> 00:57:39,931
We will not let god know
that we're missing that duffer.

675
00:57:40,003 --> 00:57:44,599
We will behave as if he
is with us all the time.

676
00:57:50,614 --> 00:57:51,945
''l'm here, Priya.''

677
00:58:07,964 --> 00:58:11,365
God has been cruel with us.

678
00:58:14,304 --> 00:58:19,037
Everything was going
alright and suddenly..

679
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:25,975
We will postpone the
date of engagement.

680
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:29,983
''No, the engagement will take
place on the appointed day.''

681
00:58:31,721 --> 00:58:35,851
Whatever Adi had fixed
nothing will change from that.

682
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:41,063
But can you arrange for
twenty five lakhs in a month?

683
00:58:41,198 --> 00:58:44,725
What? Twenty five lakhs?

684
00:58:44,801 --> 00:58:46,860
''Yes, it was assured by Adi.''

685
00:58:46,937 --> 00:58:48,666
Twenty five lakhs before engagement.

686
00:58:48,738 --> 00:58:50,672
And twenty five lakhs
before the marriage.

687
00:58:50,807 --> 00:58:53,207
But l have already paid
them twenty five lakhs.

688
00:58:54,344 --> 00:58:55,675
Fine.

689
00:58:56,213 --> 00:59:00,673
lf Adi had promised
then we'll fulfill that.

690
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:02,217
Don't worry Prabhakar.

691
00:59:02,752 --> 00:59:04,947
Where will so much money come from?

692
00:59:05,021 --> 00:59:06,886
This Vikram will pay.
He is his partner.

693
00:59:06,957 --> 00:59:08,686
l don't have so much money.

694
00:59:08,825 --> 00:59:13,694
The profit that we made last
year Adi invested in real estate.

695
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:15,889
What a lie this fellow is telling?

696
00:59:15,966 --> 00:59:18,298
''You know, the rates are falling.''

697
00:59:18,768 --> 00:59:23,034
Poor Adi! All that money is sunk.

698
00:59:23,173 --> 00:59:25,698
Okay madam. l'll leave now.

699
00:59:25,775 --> 00:59:27,709
Tell me your decision by tomorrow.

700
00:59:28,044 --> 00:59:30,706
l'll tell you now.

701
00:59:31,248 --> 00:59:33,716
l don't want this marriage.
- Anjali! Shut up.

702
00:59:33,783 --> 00:59:34,841
As you wish.

703
00:59:34,918 --> 00:59:36,317
''No, Mr. Prabhakar, listen to me.''

704
00:59:36,386 --> 00:59:38,115
''Granny, after today stop
worrying about my marriage.''

705
00:59:38,188 --> 00:59:40,053
''Don't talk like a fool, dear.''

706
00:59:40,857 --> 00:59:43,189
Some solution will surely come out.

707
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:48,721
''l don't want to marry.
- Shut up Anjali. - Sit down, dear.''

708
00:59:51,134 --> 00:59:56,071
''Vikram, what happened to
that General Motors deal.''

709
00:59:56,139 --> 00:59:58,801
Adi used to say that some
money will come out of that.

710
00:59:58,875 --> 01:00:00,467
Granny..

711
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:06,271
There is a company
called Fancy Wheels.

712
01:00:06,483 --> 01:00:08,075
They have sold the
pattern of that car.

713
01:00:08,151 --> 01:00:10,415
They did it before Adi.

714
01:00:11,821 --> 01:00:16,224
He is telling a lie. The rascal!

715
01:00:16,293 --> 01:00:18,887
''There is no use, we're ghosts.
- What will happen now?''

716
01:00:18,962 --> 01:00:22,295
''Let me see what l can do,
if at all l can.''

717
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:26,097
l'll take leave now.

718
01:00:27,103 --> 01:00:29,367
Where are you going?

719
01:00:29,439 --> 01:00:32,772
Come here. Vikram!

720
01:00:32,909 --> 01:00:39,109
lt is true that l'm not
the real uncle of Adi.

721
01:00:39,849 --> 01:00:42,317
But are we not one family?

722
01:00:43,253 --> 01:00:46,780
Now Anjali's marriage
is my responsibility.

723
01:00:49,859 --> 01:00:53,795
''Dear, you engagement
will also take place and..''

724
01:00:53,863 --> 01:00:58,800
..your marriage will also take
place the way Adi had wanted.

725
01:00:58,868 --> 01:01:00,392
Do you have so much money?

726
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:02,131
Where will l have it?

727
01:01:02,872 --> 01:01:05,864
l have thought of a way.

728
01:01:06,142 --> 01:01:10,806
l had sold my property to
one rich man Hirachand.

729
01:01:11,881 --> 01:01:16,147
That nice man is ready
to buy this property too.

730
01:01:16,486 --> 01:01:19,944
You will get a fat amount
and also a flat to live.

731
01:01:20,357 --> 01:01:22,154
No.
- Why?

732
01:01:22,225 --> 01:01:26,161
No.
- Then see this.

733
01:01:26,963 --> 01:01:33,232
Adi had taken 25 lakh
rupees from Hirachand.

734
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:38,573
There are only 2 days
left to repay the amount.

735
01:01:38,908 --> 01:01:41,103
l never borrowed any
money from Hirachand.

736
01:01:41,177 --> 01:01:43,372
Even then the date
falls due after a month.

737
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:46,171
Look the signature is also Adi's

738
01:01:46,249 --> 01:01:48,240
They are all trying
to trap my family.

739
01:01:48,318 --> 01:01:50,183
''Granny, don't listen to him.''

740
01:01:52,922 --> 01:01:55,390
''Okay, l'll leave now.''

741
01:01:55,925 --> 01:02:00,862
Think that this house is gone.
- Where are you going?

742
01:02:02,932 --> 01:02:04,524
Oh no!

743
01:02:06,936 --> 01:02:07,994
Shit!

744
01:02:09,205 --> 01:02:11,867
Why did l at all come here?

745
01:02:11,941 --> 01:02:13,875
Brother Adi.
- What's it?

746
01:02:13,943 --> 01:02:17,470
Our luck is so bad that we
can't bang our heads also.

747
01:02:19,215 --> 01:02:20,273
Come.

748
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:30,885
''Brother Adi, where are we going?
- Don't know''

749
01:02:35,965 --> 01:02:37,899
Brother Adi we are ghosts.

750
01:02:37,967 --> 01:02:39,298
l know that we're ghosts.

751
01:02:39,969 --> 01:02:41,300
That is the problem.

752
01:02:41,905 --> 01:02:43,236
What is the use of these seven days?

753
01:02:43,573 --> 01:02:44,904
What was the use in coming here?

754
01:02:44,974 --> 01:02:47,909
We can do nothing. Useless.

755
01:02:47,977 --> 01:02:49,444
Hell with it.

756
01:02:49,979 --> 01:02:52,243
Already there is very
little food inside me.

757
01:02:52,382 --> 01:02:55,180
Still l was getting to sleep
and these two have landed.

758
01:02:55,251 --> 01:02:57,378
''Hey, what's it?''

759
01:02:58,988 --> 01:03:01,183
What are you looking
here and there? Talk to me.

760
01:03:01,257 --> 01:03:02,451
Come here.
- We?

761
01:03:02,525 --> 01:03:03,924
Sit down.

762
01:03:04,527 --> 01:03:05,585
Sit down.

763
01:03:07,931 --> 01:03:09,922
Can you see us?

764
01:03:09,999 --> 01:03:14,197
Hey jumping jack. Do you
think l'm whiling my time here?

765
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:16,932
Do you know my name?

766
01:03:18,007 --> 01:03:19,065
Fakira.

767
01:03:20,009 --> 01:03:21,067
Fakira.

768
01:03:21,144 --> 01:03:23,408
BPCM.

769
01:03:24,013 --> 01:03:26,948
What's this BPCM?

770
01:03:27,016 --> 01:03:29,951
Bhoot (ghosts) Pret
(spirits) Connecting Medium

771
01:03:30,019 --> 01:03:33,011
Mama wanted me to be a
doctor and papa an engineer.

772
01:03:33,089 --> 01:03:35,216
l said that there are already
more doctors than patients.

773
01:03:35,291 --> 01:03:36,952
Then there are more
engineers than buildings.

774
01:03:37,026 --> 01:03:38,960
l wanted a
profession that is unique.

775
01:03:39,028 --> 01:03:40,962
But what to do my luck is very bad.

776
01:03:41,097 --> 01:03:44,157
ln my profession the
customers are solid.

777
01:03:44,234 --> 01:03:46,964
But they don't have a
penny to pay. Do you have?

778
01:03:47,036 --> 01:03:48,094
No. isn't it?

779
01:03:48,171 --> 01:03:50,230
Firstly there is no food inside me.

780
01:03:50,306 --> 01:03:53,969
On top of that the people
think that l've gone mad.

781
01:03:54,043 --> 01:03:55,374
They think that l'm
talking to myself.

782
01:03:55,445 --> 01:03:57,970
Mad man! Why are you
talking to yourself?

783
01:03:58,047 --> 01:03:59,105
You!

784
01:03:59,182 --> 01:04:03,175
''The disease on earth,
They think that l'm mad.''

785
01:04:03,319 --> 01:04:06,049
You are also the limit.
You were comfortably dead.

786
01:04:06,122 --> 01:04:08,989
Then why did you come
down here? Useless.

787
01:04:10,059 --> 01:04:12,994
What are you looking at me for?

788
01:04:13,329 --> 01:04:15,263
My opening speech is over.

789
01:04:15,331 --> 01:04:16,992
''Tell me, what is your problem?''

790
01:04:17,066 --> 01:04:21,002
''Fakira, only you can help me.''

791
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:23,334
What's the use?

792
01:04:25,341 --> 01:04:27,400
''Tell me, what is your tension?''

793
01:04:28,077 --> 01:04:32,343
My granny is in deep problem.

794
01:04:32,415 --> 01:04:38,012
My uncle and his friends are
bothering my family a lot.

795
01:04:38,087 --> 01:04:41,420
We can do nothing to help them.

796
01:04:41,624 --> 01:04:44,616
That's why we have
come to you for help.

797
01:04:44,694 --> 01:04:46,025
Please do something.

798
01:04:46,095 --> 01:04:50,031
l will do nothing.
Everything has to be done by you.

799
01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:51,498
l will only tell you a technique.

800
01:04:51,568 --> 01:04:54,036
ln twenty four hours you
will have power for ten minutes.

801
01:04:54,103 --> 01:04:56,037
Only power for ten minutes?

802
01:04:56,105 --> 01:04:57,629
You little ghost.

803
01:04:57,707 --> 01:05:00,107
How little is your
budget and how lot you speak.

804
01:05:00,176 --> 01:05:02,041
lf you want take it or..

805
01:05:02,111 --> 01:05:04,045
''Fakira, that'll do.''

806
01:05:05,114 --> 01:05:08,049
Now sit flat like this.

807
01:05:10,119 --> 01:05:12,053
l will teach you the wordings.

808
01:05:13,122 --> 01:05:16,057
''Praise the lord Hanuman, who is
the ocean of virtues and knowledge.'''

809
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:18,650
He is making a fool of us.
This is a hymn on lord Hanuman.

810
01:05:18,728 --> 01:05:21,060
Then do l sing a movie song for you?

811
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:25,066
''We want the power of Spiderman,
Batman and Superman.''

812
01:05:25,134 --> 01:05:26,601
You pocket transistor.

813
01:05:26,669 --> 01:05:29,467
''Do you know who was the father
of Superman, Batman and Spiderman?''

814
01:05:29,539 --> 01:05:30,733
lt was Hanuman.

815
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:33,802
Has any one flown before
in the American culture?

816
01:05:34,143 --> 01:05:39,080
These three had also
borrowed their power from Hanuman.

817
01:05:39,148 --> 01:05:43,084
Nonsense! lt is we lndians who
don't know the value of Hanuman.

818
01:05:43,152 --> 01:05:45,416
lt is alright Fakira. He
is a child so forgive him.

819
01:05:45,488 --> 01:05:46,546
Shut up.

820
01:05:47,156 --> 01:05:49,624
Now you do as l say.

821
01:05:49,759 --> 01:05:51,090
Hey Nagawale.

822
01:05:52,161 --> 01:05:54,493
ls he also a dead one?

823
01:05:54,564 --> 01:05:58,159
''No, he looks dead but he is alive.''

824
01:05:58,501 --> 01:05:59,695
Now play.

825
01:06:17,453 --> 01:06:28,591
''The one who at the feet of the
Guru wants to correct his mind.''

826
01:06:29,198 --> 01:06:40,541
''He is the beloved of the lord Ram
who can give you the boon you want.''

827
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:51,484
''Knowing that l'm ignorant l
pray to the son of the wind.''

828
01:06:52,155 --> 01:07:04,158
''Give me strength, wisdom and
education and remove my miseries.''

829
01:07:22,251 --> 01:07:24,776
''Hail the lord Hanuman,
the enlightened monkey.''

830
01:07:24,854 --> 01:07:27,186
''Hail the
conqueror of three worlds.''

831
01:07:27,256 --> 01:07:29,451
''Hail the lord Hanuman,
the enlightened monkey.''

832
01:07:29,525 --> 01:07:32,187
''Hail the
conqueror of three worlds.''

833
01:07:32,261 --> 01:07:34,195
The ambassador of Ram..

834
01:07:34,263 --> 01:07:36,458
''..the unmatched power and
son of Anjali and the wind god.''

835
01:07:36,532 --> 01:07:39,194
''The great warrior also
called the Vikram and Bajrangi.''

836
01:07:39,268 --> 01:07:41,202
''The vanquisher of evil thoughts
and well wisher of the pious mind.''

837
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:43,465
''Hail the lord Hanuman,
the enlightened monkey.''

838
01:07:43,539 --> 01:07:46,201
''Hail the
conqueror of three worlds.''

839
01:07:46,275 --> 01:07:48,470
''Hail the lord Hanuman,
the enlightened monkey.''

840
01:07:48,544 --> 01:07:50,739
''Hail the
conqueror of three worlds.''

841
01:07:50,813 --> 01:07:53,213
''The man who shines
the precious stone.''

842
01:07:53,282 --> 01:07:55,409
''The one who is
adorned by divine jewels.''

843
01:07:55,485 --> 01:07:57,749
''Your hands carry the
mace and other arms.''

844
01:07:57,820 --> 01:08:00,220
''Your shoulders adorn
the sacred thread on them.''

845
01:08:00,289 --> 01:08:02,484
''Hail the lord Hanuman,
the enlightened monkey.''

846
01:08:02,558 --> 01:08:04,958
''Hail the
conqueror of three worlds.''

847
01:08:05,228 --> 01:08:07,219
''Hail the lord Hanuman,
the enlightened monkey.''

848
01:08:07,296 --> 01:08:09,821
''Hail the
conqueror of three worlds.''

849
01:08:14,303 --> 01:08:16,498
''The manifestation of Lord
Shankar and the son of Kesari.''

850
01:08:16,572 --> 01:08:19,234
''The one with the hallow and
the one worshipped universally.''

851
01:08:19,308 --> 01:08:21,435
''The manifestation of Lord
Shankar and the son of Kesari.''

852
01:08:21,511 --> 01:08:23,775
''The one with the hallow and
the one worshipped universally.''

853
01:08:23,846 --> 01:08:26,246
''The most
knowledgeable and capable.''

854
01:08:26,315 --> 01:08:28,510
''The one eager to do
errands for Lord Ram.''

855
01:08:28,584 --> 01:08:30,848
''The most
knowledgeable and capable.''

856
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:33,252
''The one eager to do
errands for Lord Ram.''

857
01:08:33,322 --> 01:08:37,588
''The one who loves to hear the
recital of the lord's praise.''

858
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:40,254
''The one who loves to hear the
recital of the lord's praise.''

859
01:08:40,329 --> 01:08:42,263
The one who is in the heart

860
01:08:43,332 --> 01:08:45,266
''Lakshman and Sita.''

861
01:08:46,936 --> 01:08:49,268
''The one who manifested

864
01:08:54,544 --> 01:08:56,535
''The one who handled
Lord Ram's tasks.''

865
01:08:56,612 --> 01:08:59,274
''Hail the lord Hanuman,
the enlightened monkey.''

866
01:08:59,348 --> 01:09:01,282
''Hail the conqueror
of three worlds.''

867
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:03,750
''Hail the lord Hanuman,
the enlightened monkey.''

868
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:07,620
''Hail the conqueror
of three worlds.''

869
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:51,391
What dress is this?

870
01:09:51,467 --> 01:09:54,595
What do you want?
Undergarments over the dress?

871
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:56,729
What good dress the
lord has given you.

872
01:09:56,806 --> 01:09:58,330
Have you not seen 'Men in Black?

873
01:09:58,407 --> 01:10:01,934
The clothes are good but
what about the power?

874
01:10:02,011 --> 01:10:05,003
ls this some dress
from a costume shop?

875
01:10:05,081 --> 01:10:06,673
There is power in the clothes.

876
01:10:06,749 --> 01:10:09,343
Why are you beating?

877
01:10:10,686 --> 01:10:12,881
Why are they beating everyone?

878
01:10:13,022 --> 01:10:16,822
These are burden on earth
that eat out of others labor.

879
01:10:17,693 --> 01:10:19,627
No one should come in between.

880
01:10:19,695 --> 01:10:20,957
Why don't you do something?

881
01:10:21,097 --> 01:10:24,362
Will l do everything? l have
given you the dress with power.

882
01:10:24,433 --> 01:10:26,697
Now go and test the power.

883
01:10:35,711 --> 01:10:38,646
See where he has flown away?

884
01:11:02,471 --> 01:11:03,870
l have beaten everyone.

885
01:11:21,824 --> 01:11:23,621
Did you enjoy it?

886
01:11:23,693 --> 01:11:25,160
lt is good Fakira.

887
01:11:25,494 --> 01:11:26,552
l'll leave now.

888
01:11:26,629 --> 01:11:30,895
You ghost with no gratitude.
You've also become like humans.

889
01:11:32,501 --> 01:11:34,628
''Sorry, Fakira.''

890
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:39,434
Get some more bread.

891
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:44,445
Put some butter on it.

892
01:11:44,513 --> 01:11:45,571
l'm getting it.

893
01:11:45,915 --> 01:11:48,110
See what your
partner is doing there.

894
01:11:48,184 --> 01:11:50,516
He is trying to whisk
away some bread and gravy.

895
01:12:00,796 --> 01:12:06,462
lt's gone. The bread and gravy
is gone. Making a fool of me?

896
01:12:13,809 --> 01:12:18,872
Shall l get some more bread?

897
01:12:21,817 --> 01:12:25,014
What's it. Will you keep
staring at me till l digest the food?

898
01:12:25,154 --> 01:12:28,089
Have you not got the power?
Get lost. Wash everyone out.

899
01:12:28,157 --> 01:12:30,489
Get lost and let me eat.

900
01:12:30,559 --> 01:12:31,821
Thanks Fakira.

901
01:12:39,835 --> 01:12:44,829
l'll take care of you. The
bread and gravy are flying.

902
01:12:45,574 --> 01:12:49,510
''Hey, what happened?
- The bread and gravy are flying.''

903
01:12:49,578 --> 01:12:50,704
''Come, sit down and eat.''

904
01:12:55,184 --> 01:12:56,515
Granny.

905
01:13:04,794 --> 01:13:08,525
Come inside. Won't you sleep?

906
01:13:09,865 --> 01:13:12,698
You go inside. l'm
don't feel like sleeping.

907
01:13:14,704 --> 01:13:18,003
''Granny, you have to go
tomorrow morning for dialysis.''

908
01:13:18,874 --> 01:13:22,037
l don't want dialysis anymore.
- What?

909
01:13:23,946 --> 01:13:29,714
''See, poor Adi died
at such a young age.''

910
01:13:31,554 --> 01:13:34,955
''l, an old woman, is
living a borrowed life.''

911
01:13:36,892 --> 01:13:38,951
l don't want to be a
burden on anybody.

912
01:13:39,095 --> 01:13:42,155
''Don't talk like a child, granny.''

913
01:13:42,565 --> 01:13:47,559
''Really Anjali, my life
is not so precious..''

914
01:13:47,636 --> 01:13:49,900
..that we spend money on dialysis.

915
01:13:50,906 --> 01:13:52,635
''Don't talk like that, granny.''

916
01:14:01,851 --> 01:14:03,580
Let's go.
- Where?

917
01:14:04,787 --> 01:14:05,913
Come.

918
01:14:22,872 --> 01:14:26,603
''Brother Adi, who are
these dangerous people?''

919
01:14:27,143 --> 01:14:30,203
lt seems they have hired
guards to guard our money.

920
01:14:31,781 --> 01:14:33,772
Let's have some fun.

921
01:14:36,685 --> 01:14:38,152
Did you hit me?

922
01:14:38,687 --> 01:14:39,949
l didn't hit you.

923
01:14:41,891 --> 01:14:43,222
Someone hit me too.
What's happening?

924
01:14:43,292 --> 01:14:44,623
Who is hitting us?

925
01:14:44,693 --> 01:14:45,819
What's happening?

926
01:14:48,831 --> 01:14:50,093
Why are you laughing?

927
01:14:50,166 --> 01:14:51,633
Your trousers are down.

928
01:14:55,971 --> 01:14:57,632
Why are you laughing?

929
01:14:57,706 --> 01:14:58,968
Your trousers are down too.

930
01:15:07,817 --> 01:15:09,250
''Close your eyes, Maya.''

931
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:13,718
Why?
- Close them. - Okay.

932
01:15:15,925 --> 01:15:21,192
ls this for me?
- Yes.

933
01:15:22,131 --> 01:15:24,656
Wow! What a beautiful necklace.

934
01:15:25,935 --> 01:15:26,993
Ten lakhs!

935
01:15:27,937 --> 01:15:30,201
You want to be looted tonight?

936
01:15:30,272 --> 01:15:32,672
''Yes, it appears to me to be so.''

937
01:15:34,276 --> 01:15:37,677
Yes son. Something is
going to happen to you today.

938
01:15:38,848 --> 01:15:42,682
Hey! Turn around. Stay.

939
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:52,020
Come on.

940
01:15:52,962 --> 01:15:56,227
''Darling, what's wrong?
- Nothing.''

941
01:16:05,774 --> 01:16:06,900
What were you doing?

942
01:16:07,042 --> 01:16:09,306
l was watching what they
were doing. - Shut up.

943
01:16:16,986 --> 01:16:18,715
What?
- l was wondering how to ..

944
01:16:18,787 --> 01:16:21,051
..open the safe without the key.

945
01:16:22,124 --> 01:16:24,718
We are ghosts. We will
put our hands inside.

946
01:16:24,994 --> 01:16:27,326
We can put our hands inside
but how to take out the money?

947
01:16:30,933 --> 01:16:31,991
Let us think.

948
01:16:34,003 --> 01:16:35,061
ldea!

949
01:16:35,237 --> 01:16:37,205
''l'll open the safe
from inside, okay. - Okay.''

950
01:17:01,931 --> 01:17:04,365
''Don't delay, come.''

951
01:17:15,044 --> 01:17:19,777
''Darling, the best French
wine in the world. - Really?''

952
01:17:20,316 --> 01:17:24,776
Twenty two and half years old.
- Wow! Will you not offer me?

953
01:17:24,853 --> 01:17:26,184
Let's go.
- What's this?

954
01:17:26,288 --> 01:17:32,386
Best wine in the world.
- How many times will you say that?

955
01:17:32,795 --> 01:17:34,126
Go and get the glass.

956
01:17:34,196 --> 01:17:35,788
''Yes, ma'am, at your service.''

957
01:17:44,139 --> 01:17:46,471
Darling! Wine!

958
01:17:47,977 --> 01:17:51,811
Thank you.
- Cheers!

959
01:17:59,088 --> 01:18:03,354
lt tastes strange.
- lt's French wine.

960
01:18:03,425 --> 01:18:06,485
So strange. Try it again.

961
01:18:09,098 --> 01:18:13,091
What are you doing?
Why don't you drink it?

962
01:18:15,237 --> 01:18:17,364
What's this?
- Sorry.

963
01:18:19,108 --> 01:18:20,234
''Maya, please listen to me.''

964
01:18:20,309 --> 01:18:24,040
Leave me.
- Listen. - l'm leaving.

965
01:18:24,113 --> 01:18:26,911
''Maya. Listen to me, Maya.
Sorry. Maya..''

966
01:18:31,186 --> 01:18:32,380
How dare you?

967
01:18:32,454 --> 01:18:36,015
Guards!

968
01:18:36,925 --> 01:18:38,517
No!

969
01:18:48,203 --> 01:18:50,364
''Granny, how are you?''

970
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,873
We are late.
- Shall we go for dialysis?

971
01:18:54,043 --> 01:18:55,874
l'm not going anywhere.

972
01:18:56,045 --> 01:18:57,342
''Granny, don't talk like that.''

973
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:59,344
Don't argue.

974
01:19:04,219 --> 01:19:05,277
Granny!

975
01:19:07,156 --> 01:19:08,282
Granny!

976
01:19:11,226 --> 01:19:12,887
Granny!
- What happened?

977
01:19:12,961 --> 01:19:14,360
What happened?

978
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:15,897
What has happened?

979
01:19:30,179 --> 01:19:35,913
Where did this come from?
- That's what l'm thinking too.

980
01:19:36,318 --> 01:19:41,915
Maybe Adi kept it. Didn't find
the opportunity to tell about it.

981
01:19:42,257 --> 01:19:46,921
l'm opening it daily.
l've never seen it before.

982
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,929
Maybe his ghost left it there.

983
01:19:53,402 --> 01:19:54,926
''You say whatever you feel, granny.''

984
01:19:55,270 --> 01:20:01,334
You mustn't have noticed.
- Maybe.

985
01:20:02,211 --> 01:20:05,112
''Granny, will you
come for dialysis now?''

986
01:20:05,614 --> 01:20:06,945
''Yes, dear.''

987
01:20:07,216 --> 01:20:09,343
Oh yeah!
- Yeah.

988
01:20:15,491 --> 01:20:18,221
''lt's good that granny
went for dialysis, isn't it?''

989
01:20:19,027 --> 01:20:20,153
l'm tired.

990
01:20:20,229 --> 01:20:23,562
l'm tired too.

991
01:20:28,303 --> 01:20:31,295
What is brother Sunil drinking?
- Alcohol.

992
01:20:31,473 --> 01:20:33,634
''Alcohol is bad for health, isn't it?''

993
01:20:35,043 --> 01:20:36,305
Then why is he drinking?

994
01:20:36,478 --> 01:20:38,036
Last year he suffered some loss in..

995
01:20:38,113 --> 01:20:39,978
.. business and started drinking.

996
01:20:40,182 --> 01:20:41,308
Why was there a loss?

997
01:20:41,483 --> 01:20:43,576
How many questions
you ask? Let me sleep.

998
01:21:00,169 --> 01:21:01,397
ls this the time to sleep?

999
01:21:02,337 --> 01:21:06,000
Seven days are not yet
over and why have you come?

1000
01:21:06,175 --> 01:21:08,200
l came to the
neighbor Sharma's house.

1001
01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:10,469
The cloud was clear so l came early.

1002
01:21:10,546 --> 01:21:13,208
l had 15 minutes so l
thought l'll meet you.

1003
01:21:13,282 --> 01:21:14,408
One minute.
- ls something wrong?

1004
01:21:14,483 --> 01:21:17,213
''No, sit down. Are you talking
about the neighbour Mr. Sharma?''

1005
01:21:17,286 --> 01:21:22,019
Yes. - That's good. You've done
a good job for the first time.

1006
01:21:22,224 --> 01:21:25,216
Strange. You were
cursing only a few days back.

1007
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:30,561
Actually Mr. Sharma has been
in bed for the last 6 months.

1008
01:21:30,632 --> 01:21:33,032
No.
- He was suffering from bone cancer.

1009
01:21:33,202 --> 01:21:38,435
''He used to shout ''Take me away!''.
- No.''

1010
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:41,031
What happened? - The fact is
that l've not come to pick him up.

1011
01:21:41,109 --> 01:21:44,374
l've come to take his son away.
- What? - Yes.

1012
01:21:46,215 --> 01:21:47,239
You want to take away Vishal?

1013
01:21:47,382 --> 01:21:49,646
He got married only 3 years
ago and has a one year old son.

1014
01:21:49,718 --> 01:21:51,049
What are you talking?

1015
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:54,246
Don't create tensions.
His name is on the list.

1016
01:21:54,456 --> 01:21:56,390
He will come out
now to go to office.

1017
01:21:56,558 --> 01:21:59,584
ln the next corner there
will be an accident and l..

1018
01:22:00,329 --> 01:22:02,058
You took me. Was that not enough?

1019
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:03,256
This is too much.

1020
01:22:03,532 --> 01:22:06,057
''Duty, boss.''

1021
01:22:06,401 --> 01:22:09,734
When are you taking Sharma away?

1022
01:22:10,472 --> 01:22:14,067
''After 4 years,
along with me skywards.''

1023
01:22:14,142 --> 01:22:16,269
ls there no logic with
you fellows up there?

1024
01:22:16,345 --> 01:22:18,279
The one who has to go now..
you are taking him after 4 years.

1025
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:21,074
The one on whom the family
depends.. What do you say?

1026
01:22:24,253 --> 01:22:25,345
Shall l leave?

1027
01:22:27,289 --> 01:22:28,347
No?

1028
01:22:29,424 --> 01:22:34,088
l've come from so far and you
didn't show any hospitality.

1029
01:22:34,162 --> 01:22:36,096
On the contrary you
are pouncing on me.

1030
01:22:36,298 --> 01:22:41,702
Sorry. What will you have?

1031
01:22:42,271 --> 01:22:46,105
''coffee, cold drinks?''

1032
01:22:46,174 --> 01:22:48,108
What is he drinking?
- Whisky.

1033
01:22:49,278 --> 01:22:50,370
l'll also have whisky.

1034
01:22:50,445 --> 01:22:52,504
''No, that is bad and a filthy thing.''

1035
01:22:52,581 --> 01:22:53,707
Who is the guest?
- You.

1036
01:22:53,782 --> 01:22:56,307
Then l'll have whisky.
- You'll not get it.

1037
01:22:57,452 --> 01:23:00,182
Beware l'll take you up.- Will
you take me up again and again?

1038
01:23:00,289 --> 01:23:02,587
''Okay, no one will take away anyone.
l'll get some whisky.''

1039
01:23:17,472 --> 01:23:20,134
Mr. Yamraj (God of
death) that's natural folk.

1040
01:23:29,484 --> 01:23:31,418
Now l will have the whole bottle.

1041
01:23:31,486 --> 01:23:33,750
ls this some cocoa drink that
you'll have a whole bottle? No.

1042
01:23:35,657 --> 01:23:36,749
Who is the guest here?

1043
01:23:37,326 --> 01:23:38,554
''Buddy, it's you.''

1044
01:23:40,429 --> 01:23:44,160
''Bring it, buddy.
- Bring it buddy. l'll get it.''

1045
01:23:46,335 --> 01:23:47,495
What are you looking at?

1046
01:23:47,669 --> 01:23:51,161
You are crazy?
- Crazy? Sorry.

1047
01:24:03,518 --> 01:24:06,180
''Why is he drinking so much,
brother Adi? - l don't know.''

1048
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:16,193
''Hey, who's there?
- No one is there.''

1049
01:24:18,367 --> 01:24:20,528
Life should be like this.

1050
01:24:32,381 --> 01:24:34,212
Oh God! What have l done?

1051
01:24:37,386 --> 01:24:43,882
''Hey, l am here. What happened?''

1052
01:24:44,393 --> 01:24:48,227
Tired? l am the one who is
tense and you're getting tired.

1053
01:24:49,398 --> 01:24:51,229
What happened?
- What happened!

1054
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:53,494
l'm finished!

1055
01:24:54,569 --> 01:24:56,696
l'm dead!
- Come down.

1056
01:24:56,772 --> 01:24:58,433
l'm destroyed!
- Come down.

1057
01:24:58,507 --> 01:24:59,565
What?

1058
01:24:59,741 --> 01:25:01,299
What did you give me to drink?

1059
01:25:01,643 --> 01:25:05,238
''l told you. l told you,
don't drink it?''

1060
01:25:05,313 --> 01:25:06,507
You told me?
- Yes.

1061
01:25:06,648 --> 01:25:08,775
You never told me that
it will be like this.

1062
01:25:12,421 --> 01:25:15,254
What are you doing?
- Meditation.

1063
01:25:15,524 --> 01:25:17,856
Come down and do it.
- l will not.

1064
01:25:19,428 --> 01:25:20,588
Mr. Yamraj. (God of death)

1065
01:25:20,862 --> 01:25:23,422
What happened to him?
- l don't know.

1066
01:25:24,433 --> 01:25:26,264
l'd warned you.

1067
01:25:26,435 --> 01:25:27,732
''What did you want me for, sir?''

1068
01:25:27,803 --> 01:25:28,861
Oh God!

1069
01:25:28,937 --> 01:25:30,928
Should we discuss
this over a cup of tea?

1070
01:25:31,006 --> 01:25:32,268
What are you grumbling in English?

1071
01:25:32,441 --> 01:25:34,773
Because you don't understand Hindi.

1072
01:25:35,444 --> 01:25:39,278
l've lost my outdoor job.
l've lost my conveyance.

1073
01:25:39,881 --> 01:25:43,339
l'm going to get a desk job.
That means a clerk in heaven.

1074
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:44,814
What nonsense are you talking?

1075
01:25:44,886 --> 01:25:47,286
Goat. You're calling me a goat?

1076
01:25:47,456 --> 01:25:50,448
''Not goat. l said, ''What
nonsense you are talking?''

1077
01:25:50,692 --> 01:25:52,819
You mean what kind of
rubbish l'm talking?

1078
01:25:52,894 --> 01:25:54,293
Exactly.

1079
01:25:55,564 --> 01:25:57,964
My whole career is under jeopardy.

1080
01:25:58,467 --> 01:26:02,301
And you're making
fun of me. Disgusting!

1081
01:26:03,472 --> 01:26:05,303
Strange. He's gone again.

1082
01:26:06,641 --> 01:26:11,305
He drank the whisky. He fell.
He made us run around the house.

1083
01:26:13,482 --> 01:26:14,813
What's it that we did?

1084
01:26:15,484 --> 01:26:16,781
What you did?

1085
01:26:19,654 --> 01:26:21,315
Why are you scaring me?
- Am l scaring you?

1086
01:26:22,491 --> 01:26:24,322
You destroyed me.

1087
01:26:24,593 --> 01:26:28,996
From the moment l met you
l've been cursing myself.

1088
01:26:29,064 --> 01:26:30,588
Stop it!

1089
01:26:30,665 --> 01:26:32,724
We gave you only
whisky and didn't kill you.

1090
01:26:32,834 --> 01:26:36,531
Only my enemies will die.
l'm Yamraj (God of death).

1091
01:26:36,605 --> 01:26:39,870
''lf you are Yamraj, why
are you getting so hyper?''

1092
01:26:41,409 --> 01:26:44,344
You're the one getting hyper.
- Thank you.

1093
01:26:44,513 --> 01:26:51,510
''The fact is, Vishal is saved.
- Saved?''

1094
01:26:52,521 --> 01:26:57,356
l mean that he left the house
and reached the second signal.

1095
01:26:57,526 --> 01:27:00,689
But then l was here
drinking whisky and..

1096
01:27:03,532 --> 01:27:04,829
l didn't understand.

1097
01:27:05,567 --> 01:27:06,693
l will explain.

1098
01:27:14,643 --> 01:27:15,701
Kitty.

1099
01:27:15,777 --> 01:27:17,768
Kitty.

1100
01:27:19,581 --> 01:27:20,843
Sorry.

1101
01:27:20,916 --> 01:27:22,383
What sorry? This
is your daily drama.

1102
01:27:22,551 --> 01:27:24,985
When l leave for office
you're busy doing something.

1103
01:27:25,053 --> 01:27:26,782
l'm late daily because of you.

1104
01:27:26,922 --> 01:27:28,583
Why are you wasting your time now?

1105
01:27:28,723 --> 01:27:29,781
Sit down.

1106
01:27:32,661 --> 01:27:33,787
Let's go.

1107
01:27:35,564 --> 01:27:40,399
l curse the day when my
mama chose you as my bride.

1108
01:27:40,669 --> 01:27:42,398
And l curse my
father for choosing you.

1109
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:44,597
l get scolded
everyday because of you.

1110
01:27:44,806 --> 01:27:46,603
lt is like that.
- What?

1111
01:27:46,875 --> 01:27:48,399
You get scolded in
the office only ..

1112
01:27:48,476 --> 01:27:50,671
..but for me it
starts in the morning.

1113
01:27:50,812 --> 01:27:52,803
Why not? lt is all because of you.

1114
01:27:52,914 --> 01:27:55,007
Because of me? lt is
your father who is sick.

1115
01:27:55,083 --> 01:27:56,675
l take care of him day and night.

1116
01:27:56,818 --> 01:28:00,618
You never even praise
me but always scold me.

1117
01:28:00,822 --> 01:28:02,881
What praise do you want?
Should l felicitate you?

1118
01:28:02,958 --> 01:28:06,086
My papa is sick. You
want me to throw him out?

1119
01:28:06,161 --> 01:28:09,426
When did l say that?
- What else? - Look forward.

1120
01:28:16,605 --> 01:28:18,436
So what? He died.

1121
01:28:18,607 --> 01:28:20,438
This didn't happen.

1122
01:28:20,609 --> 01:28:22,440
Then?
- See this.

1123
01:28:24,779 --> 01:28:27,441
Kitty.

1124
01:28:27,515 --> 01:28:28,607
Sorry.

1125
01:28:28,717 --> 01:28:30,446
What sorry? This
is your daily drama.

1126
01:28:30,785 --> 01:28:33,117
When l leave..
- Fast forward.

1127
01:28:46,635 --> 01:28:48,967
Where is he? God
knows where he went.

1128
01:28:49,871 --> 01:28:52,465
Where did you go? You
should inform and go.

1129
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:54,735
l was getting late.
l tried to go by air.

1130
01:28:57,012 --> 01:29:01,073
That's good. Vishal will not die.
- Why will he not die?

1131
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:04,878
Every man has grace time.
- Meaning?

1132
01:29:04,986 --> 01:29:08,820
Sometimes we reach late.
Have you seen Discovery Channel?

1133
01:29:08,990 --> 01:29:11,151
Have you seen how men
die and then come alive?

1134
01:29:11,826 --> 01:29:15,159
When will Vishal die now?
- After 40 years.

1135
01:29:15,664 --> 01:29:17,757
Did l also have grace period?
- Of course.

1136
01:29:18,767 --> 01:29:21,497
Then why did l die?
- Because l reached on time.

1137
01:29:22,837 --> 01:29:27,774
Before l start crying let me leave.

1138
01:29:29,844 --> 01:29:34,907
Fine. At least Vishal is saved.

1139
01:29:35,684 --> 01:29:40,519
''Excuse me, sir.
- What's it now?''

1140
01:29:41,856 --> 01:29:44,017
Can l get one more whisky?

1141
01:29:44,693 --> 01:29:46,058
''There is a limit, buddy.''

1142
01:29:46,127 --> 01:29:48,527
You just fell flat because
of that. You want more?

1143
01:29:48,596 --> 01:29:50,530
Not for me. l can cajole ..

1144
01:29:50,598 --> 01:29:52,862
..Chitragupt (book
keeper of deeds) with that.

1145
01:29:53,134 --> 01:29:54,533
ln heaven too!

1146
01:29:56,705 --> 01:29:58,536
Okay l'll get it.

1147
01:30:06,881 --> 01:30:09,008
''Excuse me sir, your whisky.''

1148
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:12,550
''Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.''

1149
01:30:12,721 --> 01:30:14,552
My future lies in your hands.

1150
01:30:15,724 --> 01:30:17,555
''Thank you, boy.''

1151
01:30:17,625 --> 01:30:19,752
''Next you'll get a
spank from me, understood?''

1152
01:30:21,896 --> 01:30:23,557
Jolly good!
- Really.

1153
01:30:24,633 --> 01:30:25,895
What's all this?

1154
01:30:26,735 --> 01:30:28,566
Did l not give you
problems to solve?

1155
01:30:29,037 --> 01:30:32,234
The exams are due shortly and
are you all concerned or not?

1156
01:30:32,641 --> 01:30:34,165
''We were doing some drawing,
sister Priya.''

1157
01:30:34,242 --> 01:30:36,733
l know. But is that needed now?

1158
01:30:37,079 --> 01:30:41,573
''Sister Priya, this is
you and this is uncle Adi.''

1159
01:30:45,854 --> 01:30:48,789
What happened? Didn't
you like the drawing?

1160
01:30:49,925 --> 01:30:53,088
Yes. Very beautiful.

1161
01:30:54,763 --> 01:30:55,923
You all do your work.

1162
01:31:27,696 --> 01:31:28,958
''Enough, Priya.''

1163
01:31:30,799 --> 01:31:31,891
Adi!

1164
01:31:32,901 --> 01:31:35,699
Adi? He has gone up.

1165
01:31:36,805 --> 01:31:38,136
Come with me.

1166
01:31:38,974 --> 01:31:40,635
Leave me alone.

1167
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:42,970
What are you doing? Leave me.

1168
01:31:47,716 --> 01:31:49,650
''Lord Hanuman will
absolve you of all miseries.''

1169
01:31:49,718 --> 01:31:51,652
''To all who can control
their mind, actions and words.''

1170
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:53,651
''Lord Hanuman will
absolve you of all miseries.''

1171
01:31:53,722 --> 01:31:55,656
''To all who can control
their mind, actions and words.''

1172
01:31:58,994 --> 01:32:01,053
''Lord Hanuman will
absolve you of all miseries.''

1173
01:32:01,129 --> 01:32:02,858
''To all who can control
their mind, actions and words.''

1174
01:32:02,931 --> 01:32:04,990
''Lord Hanuman will
absolve you of all miseries.''

1175
01:32:05,067 --> 01:32:06,864
''To all who can control
their mind, actions and words.''

1176
01:32:06,935 --> 01:32:08,664
''Lord Hanuman will
absolve you of all miseries.''

1177
01:32:08,737 --> 01:32:10,671
''To all who can control
their mind, actions and words.''

1178
01:32:10,739 --> 01:32:12,673
''Lord Hanuman will
absolve you of all miseries.''

1179
01:32:12,741 --> 01:32:14,675
''To all who can control
their mind, actions and words.''

1180
01:32:26,288 --> 01:32:27,755
''No, that is impossible.''

1181
01:32:27,856 --> 01:32:30,222
''Granny, it is true.
lt was Adi there.''

1182
01:32:30,292 --> 01:32:31,691
Otherwise how could l and the ..

1183
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:33,022
..children have
escaped with Bunky there?

1184
01:32:33,095 --> 01:32:34,289
You are saying it just like that.

1185
01:32:34,362 --> 01:32:36,353
''One minute, Granny. l think
that Priya is telling the truth.''

1186
01:32:36,431 --> 01:32:39,889
What happened to me? Two
bottles of whisky vanished suddenly.

1187
01:32:40,035 --> 01:32:43,368
''Granny, that money! lt was
not there three days back.''

1188
01:32:44,973 --> 01:32:47,100
''Granny, please explain it to lshan.''

1189
01:32:47,209 --> 01:32:50,303
The magic show is tomorrow
and he is not practicing.

1190
01:32:50,378 --> 01:32:52,710
''Come, l'll explain it to him.''

1191
01:32:53,782 --> 01:32:59,721
''lshan, do something.
- No. l won't do anything.''

1192
01:32:59,988 --> 01:33:02,786
''lshan, why are you not practicing?''

1193
01:33:02,991 --> 01:33:04,720
l don't want to
take part in the show.

1194
01:33:05,327 --> 01:33:07,727
''Why?
- l don't want to, that's all.''

1195
01:33:08,997 --> 01:33:12,797
''lshan, if you don't take part
then it will hurt uncle Adi.''

1196
01:33:12,934 --> 01:33:14,925
Would he have left
us if it hurts him?

1197
01:33:16,004 --> 01:33:19,201
''lshan, you know
that uncle is with us.''

1198
01:33:19,274 --> 01:33:20,935
He is also helping us.

1199
01:33:21,009 --> 01:33:23,000
He is seeing us too.

1200
01:33:23,145 --> 01:33:25,943
Oh God! How did they know?

1201
01:33:26,081 --> 01:33:27,742
They are saying it
just like that. Watch.

1202
01:33:28,083 --> 01:33:31,746
''lshan, enough of your attitudes.
Otherwise we will..''

1203
01:33:34,923 --> 01:33:36,015
Okay.

1204
01:33:36,258 --> 01:33:37,748
Come here everybody.

1205
01:33:39,094 --> 01:33:41,085
Now our new magic.

1206
01:33:41,296 --> 01:33:43,355
Tie the chain.
- Chain?

1207
01:33:43,431 --> 01:33:44,830
Tie the chain.

1208
01:33:47,035 --> 01:33:50,766
''Okay. Are you sure?
- Yes, granny.''

1209
01:33:52,841 --> 01:33:55,435
Fasten the knot well.
- Okay l'll tie it.

1210
01:33:57,045 --> 01:33:58,171
Put the lock.

1211
01:33:58,246 --> 01:33:59,770
Put the lock.

1212
01:34:00,949 --> 01:34:02,780
ls it locked?

1213
01:34:02,851 --> 01:34:04,443
Follow me.

1214
01:34:05,954 --> 01:34:07,114
Open the trunk.

1215
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:13,120
How did you get in here?

1216
01:34:13,295 --> 01:34:14,785
l wanted to scare you all.

1217
01:34:18,867 --> 01:34:21,995
Where is he now?

1218
01:34:22,070 --> 01:34:23,799
l am here.

1219
01:34:25,073 --> 01:34:27,200
How did you reach there?
- Magic.

1220
01:34:31,079 --> 01:34:32,808
Let someone see my magic too.

1221
01:34:35,150 --> 01:34:37,209
Why has he not come out yet?

1222
01:34:37,319 --> 01:34:40,220
Shall we open it?
- He will bash you.

1223
01:34:45,994 --> 01:34:48,827
Excellent.
- What magic! How did lshan do it?

1224
01:34:48,997 --> 01:34:51,158
He cheated. The duplicate
key was inside his mouth.

1225
01:34:53,168 --> 01:34:55,830
ln the fifth annual
Junior Magician Competition..

1226
01:34:55,904 --> 01:34:59,169
..the next participant to
enchant you is Baby Kareena.

1227
01:35:17,325 --> 01:35:22,854
''Friends, before you will be
our next contestant, King lshan.''

1228
01:35:25,033 --> 01:35:29,367
lshan! lshan! lshan!

1229
01:35:34,209 --> 01:35:37,076
The hands of King lshan
will be tied by a chain.

1230
01:35:37,279 --> 01:35:40,407
Then that chain shall
be secured with a lock.

1231
01:35:41,049 --> 01:35:44,883
Then King lshan will
be shut in this trunk.

1232
01:35:45,153 --> 01:35:52,286
King lshan will come out of the
trunk like a bullet from a gun.

1233
01:35:57,165 --> 01:36:01,295
Look. - How many times should
l see? l've seen the rehearsal.

1234
01:36:03,171 --> 01:36:09,440
lf King lshan does this
spectacle then he will be the winner.

1235
01:36:10,078 --> 01:36:11,909
ln my five years experience l ..

1236
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:15,177
..have never seen
something like this.

1237
01:36:19,254 --> 01:36:25,090
l think that King lshan will
not be able to do this spectacle.

1238
01:36:26,194 --> 01:36:27,320
Sister Priya!

1239
01:36:30,999 --> 01:36:32,261
Help me!

1240
01:36:32,467 --> 01:36:34,935
Brother Adi..
- What?

1241
01:36:35,103 --> 01:36:38,402
What?
- What's happening? l'm worried.

1242
01:36:39,341 --> 01:36:41,468
Nothing dear.. Don't worry.

1243
01:36:44,412 --> 01:36:46,471
Come on lshan you can do it.

1244
01:36:47,115 --> 01:36:50,346
''Priya, l am worried.
ls lshan alright?''

1245
01:36:51,119 --> 01:36:53,952
''Uncle Adi, help!''

1246
01:36:55,290 --> 01:36:57,451
lshan come on. Come out.

1247
01:36:58,126 --> 01:37:00,617
Brother Adi.
- What?

1248
01:37:01,129 --> 01:37:05,361
You're worried.
- Yes. - Then go.

1249
01:37:07,302 --> 01:37:10,169
Come on lshan. You can do it.

1250
01:37:27,655 --> 01:37:29,987
''Lord Hanuman will
absolve you of all miseries.''

1251
01:37:30,158 --> 01:37:32,319
''To all who can control
their mind, actions and words.''

1252
01:37:33,328 --> 01:37:34,989
Brother Adi.

1253
01:37:36,264 --> 01:37:38,994
What is it now?
- Something is wrong with lshan.

1254
01:37:42,270 --> 01:37:43,532
''One, two, and three.''

1255
01:37:49,611 --> 01:37:51,602
''Lord Hanuman will
absolve you of all miseries.''

1256
01:37:51,679 --> 01:37:53,670
''To all who can control
their mind, actions and words.''

1257
01:37:54,082 --> 01:37:56,016
''Lord Hanuman will
absolve you of all miseries.''

1258
01:37:56,084 --> 01:37:58,211
''To all who can control
their mind, actions and words.''

1259
01:38:03,191 --> 01:38:05,022
''Lord Hanuman will
absolve you of all miseries.''

1260
01:38:05,193 --> 01:38:07,423
''To all who can control
their mind, actions and words.''

1261
01:38:20,375 --> 01:38:22,240
''Lord Hanuman will
absolve you of all miseries.''

1262
01:38:22,310 --> 01:38:24,369
''Lord Hanuman will
absolve you of all miseries.''

1263
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:33,312
Granny!

1264
01:38:34,222 --> 01:38:40,058
lshan.

1265
01:38:57,245 --> 01:38:59,076
No!

1266
01:38:59,147 --> 01:39:01,274
Tell us how you did that.

1267
01:39:01,349 --> 01:39:04,477
The magician never tells his secret.

1268
01:39:04,552 --> 01:39:09,080
''lshan, don't show off. We
knew that you'll come out.''

1269
01:39:09,157 --> 01:39:11,091
But how did you float in the air?

1270
01:39:12,427 --> 01:39:14,361
l can only tell if
there was some magic.

1271
01:39:15,430 --> 01:39:18,365
''You know, l had
dropped the key in the trunk.''

1272
01:39:18,633 --> 01:39:22,160
l was slowly getting out of breath.
- Oh God! Then?

1273
01:39:22,570 --> 01:39:27,303
Then the key floated
and the lock was opened.

1274
01:39:27,509 --> 01:39:31,445
Then someone picked me up.
- Who can pick you up?

1275
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:34,305
''Duffer, it was uncle.''

1276
01:39:34,382 --> 01:39:36,111
''lshan, you're talking rubbish.''

1277
01:39:36,184 --> 01:39:41,315
lshan is right. Adi is
amongst us and is also helping us.

1278
01:39:42,457 --> 01:39:46,120
l don't understand why he
is not coming before us.

1279
01:39:46,194 --> 01:39:47,661
''l'm standing before you, granny.''

1280
01:39:51,466 --> 01:39:58,599
''Granny, does uncle Adi
know how much we miss him?''

1281
01:39:58,673 --> 01:40:00,664
l'm missing you all too.

1282
01:40:00,742 --> 01:40:04,143
Leave us and look at her.

1283
01:40:27,502 --> 01:40:36,171
''l shall love only you
and talk only about you.''

1284
01:40:37,445 --> 01:40:46,183
''l shall love only you
and talk only about you.''

1285
01:40:47,355 --> 01:40:56,195
''From now l shall love you
day and night, my beloved.''

1286
01:40:57,365 --> 01:41:06,205
''l shall love only you
and talk only about you.''

1287
01:41:07,408 --> 01:41:16,214
''From now l shall love you
day and night, my beloved.''

1288
01:41:47,749 --> 01:41:57,784
''l had the whole world for
me and only you were missing.''

1289
01:41:58,526 --> 01:42:02,724
They are melting by my touch..

1290
01:42:02,797 --> 01:42:07,598
''..the lips which
were frozen till now.''

1291
01:42:07,669 --> 01:42:12,470
''What a season has come
and what a moment this is!''

1292
01:42:12,540 --> 01:42:17,273
''My peace is all lost and
restlessness is setting in me.''

1293
01:42:20,548 --> 01:42:29,286
''From now we shall live
together as long as life bestows.''

1294
01:42:29,691 --> 01:42:38,565
''From now l shall love you
day and night, my beloved.''

1295
01:42:39,634 --> 01:42:48,975
''l shall love only you
and talk only about you.''

1296
01:42:49,577 --> 01:42:58,645
''From now l shall love you
day and night, my beloved.''

1297
01:42:59,854 --> 01:43:08,819
''From now l shall love you
day and night, my beloved.''

1298
01:43:19,507 --> 01:43:22,499
Hi Vikram. What have you brought?

1299
01:43:22,677 --> 01:43:25,339
These are bank documents on
which l need your signature.

1300
01:43:30,685 --> 01:43:32,346
''Read it.
- Read it, brother.''

1301
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:34,351
ls this the age to read?

1302
01:43:39,694 --> 01:43:41,355
What's this joke? Sign it.

1303
01:43:41,429 --> 01:43:42,760
Am l joking?

1304
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:47,361
What's this you did? Why
did you throw the pen?

1305
01:43:47,535 --> 01:43:50,368
l didn't throw. lt went on its own.
- l just look..

1306
01:43:51,706 --> 01:43:53,037
You drunkard! Enough of it.

1307
01:43:55,376 --> 01:43:56,707
l warn you. Don't abuse him.

1308
01:43:56,844 --> 01:43:57,902
Say sorry.

1309
01:43:58,780 --> 01:44:02,841
''Sorry, sister-in-law.
lt is for the signature.''

1310
01:44:02,917 --> 01:44:05,385
''What's it?
- Nothing, some bank papers.''

1311
01:44:05,553 --> 01:44:07,384
Let me see.
- See it.

1312
01:44:09,557 --> 01:44:10,717
He is talking rubbish.

1313
01:44:12,460 --> 01:44:15,054
Enough of it. Sign it or otherwise!

1314
01:44:16,731 --> 01:44:17,789
Do something.

1315
01:44:17,865 --> 01:44:19,389
Why are you laughing?

1316
01:44:20,668 --> 01:44:23,398
He doesn't know that brother was
the boxing champion in college.

1317
01:44:23,471 --> 01:44:24,597
Mummy!

1318
01:44:27,675 --> 01:44:33,614
Don't move or else!
- Papa!

1319
01:44:34,582 --> 01:44:40,578
Hit him. Once more.

1320
01:45:24,632 --> 01:45:25,792
Get up.

1321
01:45:25,933 --> 01:45:26,991
Take this.

1322
01:45:27,802 --> 01:45:29,633
Never dare to come
to this house again.

1323
01:45:30,738 --> 01:45:31,864
Papa.

1324
01:45:35,810 --> 01:45:37,471
''l'm proud of you, papa.''

1325
01:47:09,737 --> 01:47:10,829
Come.

1326
01:47:10,905 --> 01:47:12,031
Everybody.

1327
01:47:12,106 --> 01:47:13,971
''Come, let's be there.
Let's dance now.''

1328
01:47:15,109 --> 01:47:17,043
Move your body.

1329
01:47:21,749 --> 01:47:27,585
Cool it.
- Can you hear me?

1330
01:47:49,944 --> 01:47:51,002
Groove it.

1331
01:47:58,953 --> 01:48:00,079
On the floor.

1332
01:48:03,224 --> 01:48:04,623
Everybody.

1333
01:48:04,692 --> 01:48:10,130
''Your memories, your memories.''

1334
01:48:14,135 --> 01:48:19,129
''Your memories, your memories.''

1335
01:48:23,144 --> 01:48:25,635
The sentiments are still fresh.

1336
01:48:25,713 --> 01:48:27,647
None other than you appeals to me.

1337
01:48:27,715 --> 01:48:30,240
''Every moment is
spent just on that.''

1338
01:48:30,317 --> 01:48:32,649
''You memories, your memories.''

1339
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:35,314
''You memories, your memories.''

1340
01:48:40,127 --> 01:48:41,924
''You memories, your memories.''

1341
01:48:41,996 --> 01:48:44,726
''You memories, your memories.''

1342
01:48:49,170 --> 01:48:51,331
The sentiments are still fresh.

1343
01:48:51,405 --> 01:48:53,737
None other than you appeals to me.

1344
01:48:53,808 --> 01:48:56,276
''Every moment is
spent just on that.''

1345
01:48:56,343 --> 01:48:58,675
''You memories, your memories.''

1346
01:48:58,746 --> 01:49:01,010
''You memories, your memories.''

1347
01:49:05,853 --> 01:49:07,878
''You memories, your memories.''

1348
01:49:07,955 --> 01:49:10,822
''You memories, your memories.''

1349
01:49:38,385 --> 01:49:40,319
Wherever l went.

1350
01:49:40,387 --> 01:49:42,321
''l found you there, dear.''

1351
01:49:42,389 --> 01:49:44,983
''l found you there, dear.''

1352
01:49:45,059 --> 01:49:47,926
Always you came with me.

1353
01:49:47,995 --> 01:49:49,724
Your shadow.

1354
01:49:49,797 --> 01:49:52,197
Your shadow.

1355
01:49:52,266 --> 01:49:55,201
''The dreams in my eyes
and pain in my heart.''

1356
01:49:55,269 --> 01:49:57,737
My lips only utter your name.

1357
01:49:57,805 --> 01:49:59,932
My lips only utter your name.

1358
01:50:00,007 --> 01:50:03,408
My lips only utter your name.

1359
01:50:04,211 --> 01:50:06,839
The sentiments are still fresh.

1360
01:50:06,914 --> 01:50:09,144
None other than you appeals to me.

1361
01:50:09,216 --> 01:50:11,741
''Every moment is
spent just on that.''

1362
01:50:11,819 --> 01:50:13,810
''You memories, your memories.''

1363
01:50:13,888 --> 01:50:16,755
''You memories, your memories.''

1364
01:50:21,428 --> 01:50:23,328
''You memories, your memories.''

1365
01:50:23,397 --> 01:50:26,093
''You memories, your memories.''

1366
01:50:35,442 --> 01:50:39,776
''You memories, your memories.''

1367
01:50:39,847 --> 01:50:45,183
''You memories, your memories.''

1368
01:50:47,388 --> 01:50:49,322
''You memories, your memories.''

1369
01:50:49,390 --> 01:50:51,858
''You memories, your memories.''

1370
01:50:51,926 --> 01:50:55,987
''You memories, your memories.''

1371
01:50:56,063 --> 01:51:00,193
When the moon rises on the sky.

1372
01:51:00,267 --> 01:51:02,531
The moon rises on the sky.

1373
01:51:02,803 --> 01:51:07,263
''lt brings only your
image to my mind.''

1374
01:51:07,341 --> 01:51:09,809
Brings your image.

1375
01:51:09,877 --> 01:51:12,869
My heart is filled with you.

1376
01:51:12,947 --> 01:51:15,313
You flow in every part of me.

1377
01:51:15,382 --> 01:51:17,373
You flow in every part of me.

1378
01:51:17,451 --> 01:51:19,817
You flow in every part of me.

1379
01:51:22,223 --> 01:51:24,487
The sentiments are still fresh.

1380
01:51:24,558 --> 01:51:26,822
None other than you appeals to me.

1381
01:51:26,894 --> 01:51:29,294
''Every moment is
spent just on that.''

1382
01:51:29,363 --> 01:51:31,490
''You memories, your memories.''

1383
01:51:31,565 --> 01:51:34,033
''You memories, your memories.''

1384
01:51:39,340 --> 01:51:40,967
''You memories, your memories.''

1385
01:51:41,041 --> 01:51:43,441
''You memories, your memories.''

1386
01:51:43,510 --> 01:51:48,914
''You memories, your memories.''

1387
01:51:52,519 --> 01:51:55,852
''Ten, nine, eight, seven, six.''

1388
01:51:55,923 --> 01:51:59,188
''Five, four, three, two,''

1389
01:52:05,933 --> 01:52:10,870
The time to repay the loan
taken on the house is over.

1390
01:52:10,938 --> 01:52:14,874
What will be our
destination tomorrow?

1391
01:52:14,942 --> 01:52:16,876
That house!

1392
01:52:37,564 --> 01:52:39,088
How do you like this property?

1393
01:52:39,166 --> 01:52:43,500
Here we'll build a
25-storied building.

1394
01:52:43,570 --> 01:52:46,164
You black and white TV! Who are you?

1395
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:47,502
Who am l?

1396
01:52:49,043 --> 01:52:51,307
The owner of this house.

1397
01:52:51,378 --> 01:52:54,245
By this evening this
house should be vacated.

1398
01:52:54,315 --> 01:52:56,977
You're mad.
- Mad? Me?

1399
01:53:01,422 --> 01:53:02,912
What's this?
- Read it.

1400
01:53:11,131 --> 01:53:12,530
What's written in that?

1401
01:53:13,934 --> 01:53:17,165
l told you that Adi
borrowed some money.

1402
01:53:17,237 --> 01:53:18,602
He is the one who lent that money.

1403
01:53:18,672 --> 01:53:21,197
The last date for
repayment was yesterday.

1404
01:53:21,275 --> 01:53:23,266
Will you all leave on your own or..

1405
01:53:23,344 --> 01:53:25,335
..shall l throw you
and your belongings out?

1406

l'll throw you out too
along with your belongings.

1409
01:53:33,220 --> 01:53:35,552

1410
01:53:35,622 --> 01:53:38,147
''One minute, sir.''

1411
01:53:38,225 --> 01:53:39,954
l'll explain it to her.

1412
01:53:40,027 --> 01:53:42,962
All this problem is
because of this house.

1413
01:53:44,631 --> 01:53:47,191
You sell this house to them.

1414
01:53:47,267 --> 01:53:53,263
Otherwise their physical strength
is also as real as this paper.

1415
01:54:00,647 --> 01:54:02,274
''What will you do now, black crow?''

1416
01:54:02,349 --> 01:54:03,976
''You old woman, watch it.''

1417
01:54:08,322 --> 01:54:10,449
No! No!

1418
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:14,388
Shame!

1419
01:54:14,461 --> 01:54:16,258
''What's this you're doing,
Mr. Hirachand?''

1420
01:54:17,598 --> 01:54:19,156
You have made your
fortunes with your hands and now..

1421
01:54:19,233 --> 01:54:22,464
..you are using it to dig your
nose? Take your fingers off.

1422
01:54:22,536 --> 01:54:25,004
So you're with him?

1423
01:54:26,740 --> 01:54:29,675
You hit me!
- Yes.

1424
01:54:35,082 --> 01:54:36,174
''Hey, paper!''

1425
01:54:42,689 --> 01:54:45,021
The root cause of all
problems is this old man.

1426
01:54:46,460 --> 01:54:51,363
''Hey, l'm very angry, leave my hand.
- What's your problem, man?''

1427
01:54:56,537 --> 01:54:59,028
''Why did you hit me?
- You deserve it,''

1428
01:55:11,718 --> 01:55:13,709
''What impertinence is this?
- Who, me?''

1429
01:55:23,530 --> 01:55:26,055
Give me a break!

1430
01:55:30,070 --> 01:55:31,662
Daddy!

1431
01:55:38,345 --> 01:55:42,076
Mummy! Why is my tie standing up?

1432
01:55:53,427 --> 01:55:57,090
''What happened, uncle? Are you tired?''

1433
01:55:59,166 --> 01:56:00,292
You!

1434
01:56:11,778 --> 01:56:13,370
Here take your tie.

1435
01:56:25,192 --> 01:56:27,183
What's this? You'll
fight it all alone?

1436
01:56:27,261 --> 01:56:29,661
''You also come sister,
We're enjoying it.''

1437
01:56:29,730 --> 01:56:30,788
Hi!

1438
01:56:32,799 --> 01:56:35,131
Thank you!
- Welcome.

1439
01:56:41,608 --> 01:56:42,802
What?

1440
01:56:51,818 --> 01:56:53,809
''Uncle, did you get it?''

1441
01:56:55,222 --> 01:56:56,416
You!

1442
01:57:09,570 --> 01:57:10,696
Very good! Don't leave them.

1443
01:58:13,767 --> 01:58:16,497
What happened?
- l'm tied!

1444
01:58:16,570 --> 01:58:18,504
They have tied me.

1445
01:58:22,843 --> 01:58:25,243
Stop.
- What are you doing?

1446
01:58:25,312 --> 01:58:28,406
Can't you see that l'm swinging?

1447
01:58:28,482 --> 01:58:34,250
When l was six months old my
mother swung me like this.

1448
01:58:34,321 --> 01:58:35,811
Mummy!

1449
01:58:38,525 --> 01:58:39,617
Behave yourself.

1450
01:58:39,693 --> 01:58:42,321
How can l?

1451
01:58:44,731 --> 01:58:46,858
''See what's happening there, come.''

1452
01:58:51,004 --> 01:58:54,667
'l moved there and l moved here.'

1453
01:58:54,741 --> 01:58:58,472
'l don't know which way l moved.'

1454
01:58:58,545 --> 01:59:01,378
'Oh.. l slipped.'

1455
01:59:02,783 --> 01:59:06,275
What's this that you did?

1456
01:59:10,957 --> 01:59:13,824
Mr. Hirachand!
- Shut up.

1457
01:59:16,797 --> 01:59:21,291
''Mr. Hirachand, whose
property is this? - Mine.''

1458
01:59:21,368 --> 01:59:24,895
Oh yeah!
- Yeah.

1459
01:59:34,314 --> 01:59:35,372
Adi!

1460
01:59:54,935 --> 01:59:56,994
''You're here, aren't you?''

1461
01:59:58,605 --> 02:00:01,938
l know. l can feel you.

1462
02:00:03,810 --> 02:00:04,936
Please talk to me Adi.

1463
02:00:19,025 --> 02:00:23,962
l love you.

1464
02:00:25,966 --> 02:00:28,594
''Adi, talk to me. Please!''

1465
02:00:29,870 --> 02:00:31,360
l want to see you.

1466
02:00:31,438 --> 02:00:34,999
''Where are you, Adi?
l want to see you.''

1467
02:00:36,643 --> 02:00:37,769
Where are you?

1468
02:01:03,904 --> 02:01:06,429
What is this?
- Adi has written l love you.

1469
02:01:06,506 --> 02:01:08,997
''Granny, Adi is here amongst us.''

1470
02:01:09,075 --> 02:01:13,068
l know. Why is that shameless
fellow not coming before us?

1471
02:01:14,815 --> 02:01:15,941
''l'm constrained, granny.''

1472
02:01:23,957 --> 02:01:26,084
From today no more constraints.

1473
02:01:26,159 --> 02:01:30,596
l told you that l'll
come after 7 days.

1474
02:01:34,668 --> 02:01:35,760
Take this.

1475
02:01:40,173 --> 02:01:43,108
What's this?
- Your life.

1476
02:01:44,945 --> 02:01:48,608
l had told you. You can
meet everyone for 5 minutes.

1477
02:01:50,617 --> 02:01:55,520
''Can't it be more
than 5 minutes, please?''

1478
02:01:57,123 --> 02:01:59,114
You're such a nice person.

1479
02:01:59,192 --> 02:02:02,719
No emotional blackmail.

1480
02:02:02,796 --> 02:02:04,058
Eat it.

1481
02:02:44,971 --> 02:02:46,632
Granny! See that

1482
02:02:53,914 --> 02:02:59,546
Adi!

1483
02:02:59,619 --> 02:03:01,109
Have you returned!?

1484
02:03:04,024 --> 02:03:05,150
l'm not live

1485
02:03:07,861 --> 02:03:10,853
Uncle!

1486
02:03:10,931 --> 02:03:13,866
He gave me only a little time.
- Who?

1487
02:03:13,934 --> 02:03:14,992
Yamraj.

1488
02:03:22,042 --> 02:03:25,603
''Yamraj? Here?
- Yes, he's there.''

1489
02:03:25,679 --> 02:03:30,582
''Uncle, who's this?
- Tension, l mean Shakti.''

1490
02:03:30,650 --> 02:03:32,641
''Hello everybody.
- Hello, Shakti.''

1491
02:03:32,719 --> 02:03:36,211
''The responsibility of the
whole house is on you, granny.''

1492
02:03:39,225 --> 02:03:40,715
Where are brother
Sunil and sister-in-law?

1493
02:03:40,794 --> 02:03:42,853
Sunita took Sunil to the doctor.

1494
02:03:42,929 --> 02:03:47,127
''ls everything alright?
- Yes, Sunil wants to quit alcohol.''

1495
02:03:50,570 --> 02:03:51,764
lt is good!

1496
02:03:59,312 --> 02:04:02,873
No! You remember
what happened last time?

1497
02:04:02,949 --> 02:04:04,576
But the taste is good.

1498
02:04:08,989 --> 02:04:11,253
''Granny, there will no
more shortage of money.''

1499
02:04:18,198 --> 02:04:19,597
Anjali's marriage will
be conducted grandly.

1500
02:04:45,959 --> 02:04:47,950
''How are you studies?
- Good, uncle''

1501
02:04:59,305 --> 02:05:01,034
Life should be like this.

1502
02:05:06,146 --> 02:05:11,243
''l'm dead, destroyed and finished.
- Shut up.''

1503
02:05:11,317 --> 02:05:12,909
Why did you drink alcohol again?

1504
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:18,279
l couldn't control.

1505
02:05:18,358 --> 02:05:21,657
''l'm dead, destroyed and finished.''

1506
02:05:21,728 --> 02:05:23,320
Nothing has happened to you.

1507
02:05:23,396 --> 02:05:25,864
l had to slap you
fifty times to wake you up.

1508
02:05:25,932 --> 02:05:27,331
You wasted 2 minutes of mine.

1509
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:31,234
Slapped me fifty times?
But why did you wake me up?

1510
02:05:31,304 --> 02:05:33,329
You kept your promise
so l had to keep mine.

1511
02:05:33,406 --> 02:05:36,739
You're a very nice boy.

1512
02:05:36,810 --> 02:05:39,836
That's enough of your praise.
Can l go now?

1513
02:05:41,181 --> 02:05:43,672
l'm sorry.
- What sorry?

1514
02:05:43,750 --> 02:05:46,344
Who is he talking to?
- Yamraj.

1515
02:05:46,419 --> 02:05:47,681
Why did you have to drink?

1516
02:05:47,754 --> 02:05:50,245
Then tell him to leave you behind.

1517
02:05:50,323 --> 02:05:52,188
How is that possible?

1518
02:05:52,258 --> 02:05:57,025
He can take me instead
of you. l'm a burden here.

1519
02:05:57,097 --> 02:05:59,964
''No, granny. Everyone needs you.''

1520
02:06:01,301 --> 02:06:05,294
''Mr. Yamraj, you take me.''

1521
02:06:05,371 --> 02:06:08,898
''No, Mr. Yamraj.. take me.''

1522
02:06:08,975 --> 02:06:13,708
My mummy and papa are also there.
Uncle is needed here.

1523
02:06:14,047 --> 02:06:18,711
''Yes, Mr. Yamraj
leave uncle and take me.''

1524
02:06:18,785 --> 02:06:19,843
Take me.

1525
02:06:19,919 --> 02:06:21,216
You take me!

1526
02:06:21,287 --> 02:06:22,379
Take me.

1527
02:06:22,455 --> 02:06:23,717
Take me!

1528
02:06:23,790 --> 02:06:26,122
''Please, Mr. Yamraj.''

1529
02:06:26,192 --> 02:06:29,059
Leave uncle and take me.

1530
02:06:30,230 --> 02:06:31,857
What are you all doing? Stop it.

1531
02:06:32,398 --> 02:06:33,865
Stop it now.

1532
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:35,058
Enough.

1533
02:06:35,135 --> 02:06:37,126
Everyone has to die
some day or the other.

1534
02:06:37,203 --> 02:06:39,398
Are not Shakti's
parents facing the grief?

1535
02:06:40,940 --> 02:06:42,134
Now come on.

1536
02:06:43,910 --> 02:06:45,241
All of you smile
and bid me farewell.

1537
02:06:45,311 --> 02:06:47,006
''Come on, smile.''

1538
02:06:49,415 --> 02:06:50,746
Priya.

1539
02:06:53,086 --> 02:06:54,417
You have your whole life before you.

1540
02:06:54,487 --> 02:06:57,979
''You'll get a better
boy that me, don't worry.''

1541
02:06:59,425 --> 02:07:00,756
Adi!

1542
02:07:02,328 --> 02:07:05,058
l don't want anyone else.

1543
02:07:06,299 --> 02:07:07,425
''Granny, explain to him.''

1544
02:07:11,304 --> 02:07:12,362
Adi.

1545
02:07:12,505 --> 02:07:13,767
Adi.

1546
02:07:19,279 --> 02:07:21,270
''One more minute, please.''

1547
02:07:25,785 --> 02:07:29,915
l'll not take you.
- What?

1548
02:07:29,989 --> 02:07:32,822
For the sake of
these people l leave you.

1549
02:07:34,861 --> 02:07:38,058
What will happen? l'll lose my
outdoor job. Let it be lost.

1550
02:07:39,365 --> 02:07:42,300
l don't want that job
where there is no method.

1551
02:07:42,368 --> 02:07:46,099
l'll tell Chitragupt that..

1552
02:07:47,307 --> 02:07:51,141
..there are so many people
on earth not entitled to live.

1553
02:07:51,211 --> 02:07:54,339
Corrupt people and criminals.

1554
02:07:55,815 --> 02:07:56,873
l'll manage.

1555
02:07:57,150 --> 02:07:58,811
Come on. Go.

1556
02:08:05,825 --> 02:08:07,224
Oh yeah.
- What happened?

1557
02:08:07,293 --> 02:08:09,420
Yamraj has let me live.
l'll live here now.

1558
02:08:09,495 --> 02:08:11,486
ls it?!
- Yes!

1559
02:08:12,899 --> 02:08:14,366
Uncle! We want to thank Mr. Yamraj.

1560
02:08:15,435 --> 02:08:16,561
Tell them it is okay.

1561
02:08:16,836 --> 02:08:18,326
He says that it's okay.

1562
02:08:18,404 --> 02:08:20,235
Not like that. We want to meet him.

1563
02:08:20,306 --> 02:08:22,035
''Yes, we want to meet him.''

1564
02:08:23,443 --> 02:08:24,842
''Hey, Adi.''

1565
02:08:26,980 --> 02:08:28,038
No.

1566
02:08:29,515 --> 02:08:30,846
Will you break the children's heart?

1567
02:08:30,917 --> 02:08:32,509
Don't make me emotional.

1568
02:08:35,588 --> 02:08:36,850
Okay.

1569
02:08:49,135 --> 02:08:50,329
Hello everybody.

1570
02:08:50,403 --> 02:08:51,927
Sanjay Dutt!

1571
02:08:54,540 --> 02:08:55,871
Who is that?

1572
02:08:55,942 --> 02:08:57,034
''l'm fed up, you know?''

1573
02:08:57,110 --> 02:08:59,476
Four days back someone
called me Munnabhai.

1574
02:08:59,545 --> 02:09:02,537
Some years back people
called me Khalnayak and Raghubhai.

1575
02:09:02,615 --> 02:09:03,877
Who are these people?

1576
02:09:03,950 --> 02:09:05,884
Next time you meet Sanjay Dutt..

1577
02:09:05,952 --> 02:09:09,547
..tell him that he
looks like Yamraj.

1578
02:09:09,622 --> 02:09:11,886
Okay.
- See you.

1579
02:09:11,958 --> 02:09:13,391
Excuse me.
- Yes.

1580
02:09:13,459 --> 02:09:17,225
''Can l get you tea,
coffee or something else?''

1581
02:09:19,232 --> 02:09:20,426
Can l get that?

1582
02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:28,907
l was joking.

1583
02:09:28,975 --> 02:09:32,467
ln ten minutes l have to pick a
consignment from the hospital.

1584
02:09:32,545 --> 02:09:34,979
Bye.
- Friend!

1585
02:09:43,589 --> 02:09:45,648
Adi!

1586
02:09:49,195 --> 02:09:51,925
Don't cry.

1587
02:09:51,998 --> 02:09:53,932
Don't leave us and go.

1588
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:55,490
What are you saying?

1589
02:09:58,271 --> 02:09:59,499
Stay here with us.

1590
02:09:59,572 --> 02:10:02,473
''Please, Mr. Yamraj.''

1591
02:10:02,542 --> 02:10:07,241
''Stay with us, please.''

1592
02:10:10,550 --> 02:10:12,040
First time you said
nice things about me.

1593
02:10:13,553 --> 02:10:15,418
Otherwise the whole world curses me.

1594
02:10:15,488 --> 02:10:18,685
''Death, the crusader
of death and all that.''

1595
02:10:22,362 --> 02:10:26,423
You're a lucky fellow. You
have these nice children with you.

1596
02:10:26,499 --> 02:10:28,296
You also stay back.

1597
02:10:29,469 --> 02:10:31,630
You know that l have my job.

1598
02:10:31,704 --> 02:10:33,467
Then resign it.

1599
02:10:35,541 --> 02:10:37,008
''Don't be childish, Adi.''

1600
02:10:37,076 --> 02:10:40,239
Whenever you think
about me call out to me.

1601
02:10:40,313 --> 02:10:42,042
l will surely come.

1602
02:10:46,319 --> 02:10:47,479
Bye everybody.

1603
02:11:03,336 --> 02:11:07,238
Uncle!

1604
02:11:15,348 --> 02:11:16,406
Shut up.

1605
02:11:19,419 --> 02:11:20,750
What happened? What's your problem?

1606
02:11:21,020 --> 02:11:22,681
Why are you asking all
these questions? l'm fine.

1607
02:11:28,528 --> 02:11:31,156
This boy is going inside?
You can't go inside.

1608
02:11:31,230 --> 02:11:33,425
Wait.
- Leave me.

1609
02:11:33,499 --> 02:11:35,023
Oh God!

1610
02:11:39,572 --> 02:11:43,064
What are you doing here?
l stay two blocks away.

1611
02:11:43,142 --> 02:11:45,667
Can l come here daily to play?

1612
02:11:45,745 --> 02:11:49,044
''Of course, Shakti.
- How do you know my name?''

1613
02:12:00,393 --> 02:12:05,729
Who's that?
- Don't know. Let us see.

1614
02:12:11,103 --> 02:12:14,231
Ask him.
- Okay.

1615
02:12:14,407 --> 02:12:15,738
Excuse me.

1616
02:12:17,343 --> 02:12:18,469
Yes.

1617
02:12:18,544 --> 02:12:20,739
Oh God! Yamraj!

1618
02:12:23,282 --> 02:12:26,080
Me? Yamraj?

1619
02:12:26,152 --> 02:12:29,451
You must be mistaken.
My name is Sanjay Dutt.

1620
02:12:29,522 --> 02:12:30,682
l do small roles in movies.

1621
02:12:30,756 --> 02:12:32,815
''Of course, Sanjubaba. How are you?''

1622
02:12:33,092 --> 02:12:35,356
The children were joking.

1623
02:12:35,428 --> 02:12:37,487
Say sorry.
- Sorry. - Never mind.

1624
02:12:37,563 --> 02:12:39,155
Why have you come here?

1625
02:12:39,232 --> 02:12:41,166
l have been eyeing this
property for a long time.

1626
02:12:41,234 --> 02:12:42,599
lt is good.

1627
02:12:43,703 --> 02:12:46,365
l thought that if you
want to sell it then.. - No.

1628
02:12:47,607 --> 02:12:49,598
Okay. Why are you shouting?

1629
02:12:49,675 --> 02:12:51,267
Don't sell it if you don't want to.

1630
02:12:51,344 --> 02:12:55,110
Actually l risked my
life to save this house.

1631
02:12:55,181 --> 02:12:58,776
Okay. Can l get a glass of water?

1632
02:12:58,851 --> 02:13:00,716
''Of course, please come in.''

1633
02:13:07,793 --> 02:13:10,694
''Mama, what are you looking at?''

1634
02:13:10,763 --> 02:13:14,529
Look at this. This
is fifty kilograms.

1635
02:13:14,600 --> 02:13:17,592
How much?
- Fifty kilograms.

1636
02:13:19,305 --> 02:13:22,138
Have you seen that movie?
- Three times.

1637
02:13:22,208 --> 02:13:24,335
Then why call me Yamraj?

1638
02:13:24,410 --> 02:13:27,743
That was a slip of the tongue.

1639
02:13:27,813 --> 02:13:30,805
A tongue of slip!

1640
02:13:30,883 --> 02:13:34,478
''Does that make me Yamraj?
- That was a mistake, uncle.''

1641
02:13:34,554 --> 02:13:36,146
''Will you kill the
child for that, uncle?''

1642
02:13:36,222 --> 02:13:38,349
''l mean, will you take a life?''

1643
02:13:38,424 --> 02:13:41,154
''Forget it, uncle.
Give me a magical hug.''

1644
02:13:41,227 --> 02:13:42,421
Everything will be
alright after that.

1645
02:13:42,495 --> 02:13:44,156
''Good idea, come.''

1646
02:13:49,435 --> 02:13:51,164
Hey Where are you going?

1647
02:13:52,438 --> 02:13:53,496
l also want the hug.

1648
02:13:58,711 --> 02:13:59,837
Life should be like this.
