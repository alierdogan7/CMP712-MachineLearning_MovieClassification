Let him go. Let him out, you hear?

1050
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:40,099
Lucify, you...

1051
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:41,686
(YOWLING)

1052
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:21,808
Bruno. Yes, Bruno!

1053
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:25,010
Quick, get Bruno. Get Bruno!

1054
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:30,325
(TWEETING)

1055
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:40,324
(WHINNYING)

1056
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:44,610
(WHINNYING)

1057
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:48,489
Oh! Of all the stupid
little idiots.

1058
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:50,939
I'll do it myself.

1059
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:52,739
Get away from me.

1060
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:56,089
I'll make it fit. (STRAINING)

1061
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:58,259
- There.
- It fits.

1062
01:10:58,260 --> 01:10:59,846
It fits?

1063
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:04,048
(GASPING) No!

1064
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:12,802
- (SIGHING)
- Oh, Your Grace, I'm dreadfully sorry.

1065
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:14,499
It shan't happen again.

1066
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:16,290
Precisely, madam.

1067
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:30,779
(PANTING)

1068
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:32,379
(GROWLING)

1069
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:33,966
(MEOWING)

1070
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:45,564
Come on, come on.
Get up, Gus-Gus, get up.

1071
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:48,048
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

1072
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:50,688
Let go, let go.

1073
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:58,179
You are the only ladies in the
household I hope... I presume.

1074
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:00,979
- There's no one else, Your Grace.
- Quite so.

1075
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:03,851
- Good day. Good day.
- CINDERELLA: Your Grace?

1076
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:06,779
Your Grace, please, wait.

1077
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:08,979
May I try it on?

1078
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:11,899
- STEPMOTHER: Pay no attention.
- DRIZELLA: It's Cinderella.

1079
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:13,859
- From the kitchen.
- Ridiculous.

1080
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:15,979
She's out of her mind.

1081
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:17,979
Just an imaginative child.

1082
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:21,284
Madam, my orders
were "every maiden."

1083
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:24,365
Come, my child.

1084
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:41,099
Oh, no.

1085
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:43,619
No, no, no. Oh, no!

1086
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:45,779
Oh, this is terrible.

1087
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:48,287
The King, what will he say?

1088
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:50,299
What will he do?

1089
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:51,939
Perhaps, if it would help...

1090
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:55,499
No, no. Nothing can
help now. Nothing.

1091
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,768
But, you see, I have
the other slipper.

1092
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:05,489
(ALL CHEERING)

1093
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:14,005
(RINGING)

1094
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:38,619
<i>Have faith in dreams</i>

1095
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:41,419
<i>And someday</i>

1096
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:47,019
<i>Your rainbow will</i>
<i>come smiling through</i>

1097
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:51,899
<i>No matter how your</i>
<i>heart is grieving</i>

1098
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:56,179
<i>If you keep on believing</i>

1099
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:59,499
<i>The dream that you wish</i>

1100
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:03,805
<i>Will come true</i>
