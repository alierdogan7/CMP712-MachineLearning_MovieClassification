Meg, I wonder would
you mind... Gustave?

721
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:35,341
What's wrong? My son. He was with...

722

01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:29,740
<i>then our son shall have all I can give!</i>

901
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:32,326
<i>Ah, Christine!</i>

902
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:38,040
<i>All I create on this Earth</i>

903
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:43,212
<i>all that I'll never be worth</i>

904
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:50,052
<i>all shall be his!</i>

905
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:33,178
All shall be his?

906
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:39,893
<i>Ten long years, and he casts us aside!</i>

907
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:45,899
<i>Ten whole years, this is how we're repaid!</i>

908
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:50,821
<i>Ten dark years of toil and tears</i>

909
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:53,032
<i>and now what we've worked for</i>

910
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:56,201
<i>will go to that child!</i>

911
01:05:57,037 --> 01:05:58,370
<i>All our hopes</i>

912
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:01,749
<i>were at last in our grasp!</i>

913
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:05,794
<i>All the dreams and the plans that we laid!</i>

914
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:09,256
<i>Everything is vanishing</i>

915
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:14,303
<i>and we get discarded, rejected, reviled!</i>

916
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:18,432
<i>All of the bonds in between us, now torn!</i>

917
01:06:18,642 --> 01:06:23,062
<i>All of the love that we gave him foresworn!</i>

918
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:25,314
<i>All would be ours</i>

919
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:32,321
<i>if that bastard had never been born!</i>

920
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:13,153
One more.

921
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:15,239
Ah, buddy, don't you think you had enough?

922
01:07:15,323 --> 01:07:16,365
It's practically morning already.

923
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:17,991
One more, I said!

924
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:20,703
All right.
All right.

925
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:25,749
My shift is over anyway, so
let's settle the bill, okay?

926
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:38,220
Jeez, you're in a bad way, ain't ya?

927
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:40,305
Worse than most that wind up here.

928
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:45,728
Here's the morning shift. Maybe
he'll know what to do with you.

929
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:46,895
(SCOFFS)

930
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:48,689
Yes.

931
01:07:49,149 --> 01:07:53,652
Yes, what to do with me.
That's the question, isn't it?

932
01:07:55,196 --> 01:08:00,117
That's always been the question,
ever since the beginning.

933
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:06,123
<i>She looks for sympathy</i>

934
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:11,336
<i>I give her sorrow</i>

935
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:16,717
<i>She asks for honesty</i>

936
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:22,639
<i>I've none to borrow</i>

937
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:27,144
<i>She needs my tender kiss</i>

938
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:30,773
<i>She begs it of me</i>

939
01:08:32,192 --> 01:08:35,277
<i>I give her ugliness</i>

940
01:08:37,197 --> 01:08:42,201
<i>Why does she love me?</i>

941
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:46,872
<i>She yearns for higher things</i>

942
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:50,918
<i>Things I can't give her</i>

943
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:55,005
<i>The rush that music brings</i>

944
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:59,384
<i>I can't deliver</i>

945
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:03,430
<i>And even when she sings</i>

946
01:09:03,515 --> 01:09:06,892
<i>And soars above me</i>

947
01:09:07,227 --> 01:09:10,729
<i>I try to clip her wings</i>

948
01:09:10,814 --> 01:09:16,568
<i>Why does she love me?</i>

949
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:21,156
<i>One more drink, sir</i>

950
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:24,034
<i>That's what I need, don't you think, sir?</i>

951
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:31,083
<i>Leave the hurt behind...</i>

952
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:38,215
Did you hear me?
Another drink!

953
01:09:42,762 --> 01:09:45,597
<i>She wants the man I was</i>

954
01:09:47,058 --> 01:09:50,227
<i>Husband and father</i>

955
01:09:50,937 --> 01:09:54,273
<i>At least, she thinks she does</i>

956
01:09:54,983 --> 01:09:58,485
<i>She needn't bother</i>

957
01:09:58,987 --> 01:10:02,573
<i>Beneath this mask I wear</i>

958
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:05,868
<i>There's nothing of me</i>

959
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:09,955
<i>Just horror, shame, despair</i>

960
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:15,252
<i>Why does she love me?</i>

961
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:19,006
<i>How 'bout you, sir?</i>

962
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:23,010
<i>Tell me, what am I to do, sir?</i>

963
01:10:23,678 --> 01:10:29,474
<i>Leave the hurt behind</i>

964
01:10:34,147 --> 01:10:35,856
<i>Morning, Bernie Coffee, please</i>

965
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:37,399
<i>Hurry up before I freeze</i>

966
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,484
<i>I'll just take it black</i>

967
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:43,906
Vicomte.
Fancy meeting you here.

968
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,407
Miss Giry.

969
01:10:46,784 --> 01:10:48,327
Drowning your sorrows, are you?

970
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:54,249
On the contrary, I'm celebrating
a reunion with old friends.

971
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:58,337
Friends I had long thought dead and buried.

972
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:01,840
And you?
Me?

973
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,593
I've been for a swim.

974
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:09,306
<i>This town is coarse and cold and mean</i>

975
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:13,560
<i>It's hard to keep your conscience clean</i>

976
01:11:13,645 --> 01:11:17,189
<i>Faceless in the crowd</i>

977
01:11:18,066 --> 01:11:21,276
<i>Anything's allowed</i>

978
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:25,781
<i>And so I come at dawn each day</i>

979
01:11:25,865 --> 01:11:29,701
<i>Come to wash it all away</i>

980
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:33,455
<i>Sink into the sea</i>

981
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:37,626
<i>Blue and cool and kind</i>

982
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:41,546
<i>Let it set me free</i>

983
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:45,926
<i>Let the past unwind</i>

984
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:54,393
<i>Leave the hurt behind</i>

985
01:11:58,189 --> 01:11:59,523
Miss Giry?

986
01:12:00,191 --> 01:12:02,401
What do you think will happen, Vicomte?

987
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:05,070
At the concert.
Have you thought?

988
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:09,616
When he hears her sing
again? When she sings...

989
01:12:09,701 --> 01:12:11,702
Miss Giry, I wish I knew.

990
01:12:11,786 --> 01:12:15,122
But I'm afraid her music has always
been somewhat of a mystery to me.

991
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:17,290
But there's more to this
than the music, monsieur.

992
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:19,501
Believe me. I saw it.

993
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:22,963
There's something...
I don't know.

994
01:12:23,423 --> 01:12:26,508
Just take her away. Now.

995
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:28,885
For all our sakes.

996
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:31,263
<i>Sail across the sea</i>

997
01:12:32,265 --> 01:12:35,350
<i>Put us out of mind</i>

998
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:39,646
<i>Close your eyes and flee</i>

999
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:44,151
<i>Let yourself stay blind</i>

1000
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:47,654
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

1001
01:12:47,739 --> 01:12:51,283
Trust me, monsieur.
Don't let her sing.

1002
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:56,788
Once he gets into her soul, there's
nothing she won't do for him.

1003
01:12:58,124 --> 01:13:01,543
<i>Leave this place behind</i>

1004
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:04,796
Miss Giry! Miss Giry!

1005
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:07,674
He's not Mephistopheles, you know?

1006
01:13:07,759 --> 01:13:12,179
When it comes down to it, he's
just another circus freak.

1007
01:13:12,263 --> 01:13:13,346
I'm not afraid of him.

1008
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:18,560
No. It can't be!

1009
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:19,895
Not afraid of me, you say?

1010
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:22,314
Stay back! Or I'll kill you, I promise you.

1011
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,732
Insolent boy.

1012
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:26,610
You think you own more
of her soul than I do?

1013
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:28,653
She is my wife!

1014
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:31,114
Your music may speak to her,

1015
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:34,576
but her heart will always follow me.

1016
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:38,914
You think so?
You really think so?

1017
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:45,879
Follow you?
With all your charms?

1018
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:49,841
<i>Look at you, deep in debt</i>

1019
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:52,886
<i>Stinking drunk, pitiful</i>

1020
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:56,765
<i>Shall we two make a bet?</i>

1021
01:13:57,183 --> 01:14:00,644
<i>Devil take the hindmost?</i>

1022
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:04,147
<i>Look at you, foul as sin</i>

1023
01:14:04,232 --> 01:14:07,150
<i>Hideous, horrible</i>

1024
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:10,654
<i>Call the stakes, deal me in</i>

1025
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:13,907
<i>Devil take the hindmost</i>

1026
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:17,994
<i>Our Christine shall choose
tonight Let her choose</i>

1027
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:21,123
<i>Is she yours or mine?</i>
<i>Draw the line</i>

1028
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:24,459
<i>If she sings, you lose tonight I won't lose</i>

1029
01:14:24,544 --> 01:14:26,169
<i>You leave from here?</i>
<i>Fine</i>

1030
01:14:26,254 --> 01:14:27,921
<i>Disappear?</i>
<i>Fine</i>

1031
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:30,882
<i>And if she won't?</i>
<i>If I win?</i>

1032
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:34,344
<i>All your debts wiped away</i>

1033
01:14:34,428 --> 01:14:37,681

<i>You think you're in control</i>

1037

<i>Well, I will gladly roll</i>

1039

<i>I'll bet against the house</i>

<i>I'll even double down</i>

1041

<i>Fate has redesigned most</i>
<i>Fortune's on my side</i>

1042

1043
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:57,409
<i>Let us play I won her from you then</i>

<i>Let me just get through this</i>
<i>Listen, please I need to</i>

1228
01:24:59,178 --> 01:25:03,806
<i>You need so much, it's true</i>

1229
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:08,561
<i>And I've denied you</i>

1230
01:25:10,022 --> 01:25:13,691
<i>You need the man you knew</i>

1231
01:25:14,735 --> 01:25:18,112
<i>Back here beside you</i>

1232
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:23,367

1233
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:26,829
<i>Just ask it of me</i>

1234
01:25:26,914 --> 01:25:30,708
<i>But we must leave here now</i>

1235
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:37,715

But, darling, I'm due
on stage in 10 minutes.

1237
01:25:43,055 --> 01:25:45,765
How can I possibly...
I beg you please. Please.

1238
01:25:45,849 --> 01:25:49,227
I have a passage for three to
