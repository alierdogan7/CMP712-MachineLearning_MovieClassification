1
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:19,759
Tanya, Fievel...

2
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:23,359
will you stop that
twirling, twirling?

3
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,961
That's it.
I mean it.

4
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,132
But, Mama,
it's Hannukah!

5
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,143
For you, every night
is Hannukah.

6
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,644
Papa,
enough already.

7
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,010
They'll never
get to sleep.

8
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:37,675
All right.
All right.

9
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,047
Presents.

10
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:40,847
What about presents?

11
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,979
Presents?
What presents?

12
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,024
Oh, Papa.

13
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,395
Just a joke.

14
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,897
For Tanya,
a new babushka.

15
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,831
Happy Hannukah.

16
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,562
Oh, Papa.

17
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,069
Thank you.

18
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:00,230
You have
only one parent?

19
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,830
Thank you, Mama.

20
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:05,344
And for you, Fievel,

21
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,878
a new hat.

22
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:10,746
A hat that has
been in the family...

23
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,785
for three generations.

24
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,376
It belonged to me,

25
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:17,252
my father,
and my father's father,

26
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:20,258
and now
it belongs to you.

27
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,692
Happy Hannukah.

28
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,731
It's too big.

29
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,061
You'll grow.

30
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:31,068
Ah, did I ever tell you...

31
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:35,267
about the giant
mouse of Minsk?

32
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,399
No.

33
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,738
No.

34
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,404
Like the mouse
with long hair...

35
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,244
that the prince
climbed up?

36
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:46,752
No. This mouse,
the mouse of Minsk,

37
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,253
was tall as a tree.

38
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:52,985
His tail was
a mile long.

39
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,083
Really?

40
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,286
Really.

41
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,261
He was so big,

42
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,730
he frightened
all the cats.

43
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,767
Don't say that word.

44
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,768
Talk about
something else.

45
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:04,768
America.

46
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,270
Another fairy tale.

47
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,931
America.

48
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:09,804
What a place.

49
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,173
What a place.

50
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:15,078
In America, there are
mouseholes in every wall.

51
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,342
Who says?

52
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,508
Everyone!

53
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,518
Bread crumbs
on every floor!

54
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,019
You're talking
nonsense.

55
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:25,023
In America,
you can say anything.

56
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,649
But most important,

57
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,694
and this I know,

58
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:32,197
in America,
there are no cats.

59
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,233
Shh. They'll
hear you.

60
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,030
How could they hear us?

61
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,536
There, you see?

62
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:39,832
Waa!

63
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:43,670
The cossacks!

64
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:44,903
The cossacks!

65
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,083
Don't cry, Yasha.

66
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,915
I'll scare them away.

67
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,887
Fievel, you'll get hurt!

68
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,983
Go away!

69
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,763
Go away, cats!

70
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,264
Go away!

71
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,265
Grrr!

72
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,323
Aah!

73
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:00,846
Whoa!

74
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,185
Whoa!

75
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,851
Aah!

76
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:30,448
Fievel, angel,
are you all right?

77
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,643
Yes, Mama.

78
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:35,448
Then never
do that again!

79
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:38,621
Mama, look.

80
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,730
In America...

81
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,463
there are no cats.

82
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,370
Look, Papa, water.

83
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,535
Is it the ocean?

84
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,636
Yes. Keep walking.

85
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,713
Look, Papa, smoke.

86
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,156
Is the boat on fire?

87
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:48,955
No. Keep walking.

88
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,904
Look, Papa, birds!

89
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,735
Are they sea gulls?

90
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,707
Keep walking!
Keep walking!

91
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,038
Keep walking.

92
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,544
Keep walking!

93
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:11,245
I just wanted to see.

94
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:16,254
This is the last time
I take you to America.

95
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,482
Bye-bye!

96
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,761
Auf wiedersehen.

97
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,228
Auf wiedersehen.

98
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,425
Auf wiedersehen.

99
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,435
I got a cousin
in America.

100
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,494
You and everybody else.

101
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,183
Are we there yet?

102
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,627
Not yet. Soon.

103
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,528
How soon?

104
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,691
Soon.

105
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,929
Maybe we should have
stayed in Russia.

106
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,971
We'll be all right.

107
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,472
As long as
we're together,

108
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,338
we'll be all right.

109
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,166
Ahh, so, Mr. Curious,

110
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,361
you've discovered
the herring.

111
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:38,334
Herring?

112
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,702
I thought
they were fish.

113
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,172
But, Fievel,

114
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,505
Herring are fish.

115
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:45,839
Really?

116
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:50,814
Certainly. In the ocean,
there are all kinds of fish.

117
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,214
All kinds?

118
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:56,414
Yes. Tiny fishes,
not so tiny fishes,

119
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,515
fishes as big
as this boat.

120
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,355
Wow!

121
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,863
Let's go up
and see the fish!

122
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,524
Not now.
Your mama's worried.

123
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:10,925
Come back, Fievel.

124
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,099
Wait!

125
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:20,545
What am I going
to do with you?

126
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,012
Mama!

127
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:25,778
Ah, so we return,
hmm?

128
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,046
We saw some fish.

129
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,212
Fish?

130
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:32,348
Lucky you didn't
see some cats.

131
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:33,357
Cats!

132
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,358
<i>Gato!</i>

133
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:35,359
<i>Katzen!</i>

134
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,452
Cats!

135
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,020
I didn't see any cats.

136
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:40,227
Whew.

137
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:44,235
Won't it be nice
to get to America...

138
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:47,238
where we don't
have to worry.

139
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:50,241
There are no cats
in America,

140
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,176
but back home
in Mother Russia...

141
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:55,304
ohh...

142
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,576
# Our family
was traveling #

143
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,811
#Through the snow
to Minsk #

144
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,251
# Suddenly Papa #

145
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,414
# Saw those
huge paw prints #

146
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,458
#When I heard him
screaming #

147
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,993
# I fainted dead away #

148
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,723
#And I woke up
an orphan #

149
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,662
<i># Oy vey #</i>

150
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,260
But...

151
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,495
But...
<i>But...</i>

152
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,698
# But there are no cats
in America #

153
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,833
#And the streets
are paved with cheese #

154
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:27,345
#There are no cats
in America #

155
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:31,281
# So set your mind
at ease #

156
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,946
<i>Ma la cosa terribile</i>
<i>que esiste in la patria mia.</i>

157
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:39,889
If you think things
were bad in Russia,

158
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,087
you should see things
in my country.

159
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,925
#The times were hard
in Sicily #

160
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,828
#We had no provolone #

161
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,799
#The Don, he was a tabby #

162
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,768
#With a taste
for my brother Tony #

163
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,804
#When Mama went
to plead for him #

164
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,102
#The Don said
he would see her #

165
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,972
#We found her rosary
on the ground #

166
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:01,308
Poor Mama mia.

167
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:04,842
But...

168
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:08,512
# But there are no cats
in America #

169
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:11,818

# So set your
mind at ease #

172
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,332
Sure, that's sad,

173
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,697
but sadder still...

174
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,896
#When I was but a lad #

175
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:29,270
# I lost
my true love fair #

176
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,831
#A calico #

177
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:35,313
# He caught us
by surprise #

178
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,441
# In a flash
of teeth and fur #

179
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:43,614
# Her tail was all
he left of her #

180
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,816
# 'Neath the heather #

# Is where it

182
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,870
But...

183
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:02,135

00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,854
#We sail #

191
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:30,459
#These seas ##

192
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,224
Hey, fellas,
want a bite?

193
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:12,277
Oh, it's the end
of the world.

194
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,244
No, it's worse.

195
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,308
Aah!

196
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,181
Hmm.

197
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:24,845
Aah!

198
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,102
Fievel.

199
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,003
Fievel,
come, sit here.

200
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,871
Yes, Papa.

201
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,535
Fievel.

202
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,545
Fish!

203
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:25,708
Fievel!

204
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:26,944
Fievel!

205
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,216
Fievel!

206
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:33,053
I'm getting
my hat, Papa.

207
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,226
Fievel!

208
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,595
Fievel, come back.

209
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,463
My hat!

210
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,594
Wait!

211
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,705
Fievel, stop!

212
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:56,975
Stop!

213
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:03,643
Papa!

214
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:04,984
Fievel!

215
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,920
Don't move!

216
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,426
Papa!

217
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,122
Grab my hand!

218
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,493
Help!

219
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,498
Grab my hand!

220
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,596
Fievel!

221
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:18,829
Aah!

222
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:33,006
Aah!

223
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:44,627
Aah!

224
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,129
Fievel, come back!

225
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:47,187
Aah!

226
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,998
Papa, help!

227
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,410
Aah!

228
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,617
Fievel!

229
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,450
Fievel!

230
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:18,029
Fievel!

231
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,967
Papa!

232
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,027
America.

233
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,533
No, no. New York.

234
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,033
Name?

235
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:01,538
Smovolodnydhromovichsky.

236
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,098
Ok, Mr... Smith.

237
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:08,375
Family, Mousekewitz.

238
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:09,880
How many?

239
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:10,937
Five...

240
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:13,712
I mean four.

241
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,275
Ok. Next.

242
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:21,616
Papa, why did they
change my name to Tilly?

243
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,597
# Give me your tired #

244
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:39,405
#Your poor #

245
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:42,379
#Your huddled masses #

246
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:47,749
#Yearning to breathe free #

247
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:57,421
#The wretched refuse
of your teeming shore #

248
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:05,699
# Send these,
the homeless #

249
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:11,732
#Tempest-tossed, to me #

250
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:21,276
# I lift my lamp
beside the golden door ##

251
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:31,795
<i>Qu'est-ce que c'est?</i>

252
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,296
Ah-choo!

253
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,629
Ah! A little immigrant.

254
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:38,898
Now they are
coming by bottle.

255
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:44,138
Uh, where is
your papa...

256
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,177
your mama, eh?

257
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,737
They were on
the boat to America.

258
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:53,581
Then you are in luck,
my little immigrant.

259
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,210
This is America!

260
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:57,654
America.

261
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,157
I thought
it was bigger.

262
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:02,159
Oh, it is bigger.

263
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:05,822
All of that
is also America.

264
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,387
Wow!

265
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:11,402
This is just an island
at the doorway...

266
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,836
where I,
Henri Le Pigeon,

267
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:17,397
am putting up
my Statue of Liberty.

268
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,238
Ah, that's better.

269
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,687
I know,
my little immigrant,

270
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:32,690
you want to find
your family,

271
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,225
and you will.

272
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,726
But how?

273
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:39,696
It's so far away,
and it's so big!

274
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,199
I'll never
find them anyway.

275
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:44,201
<i>Je m'excuse, pardon...</i>

276
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,203
but did you say...

277
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:47,704
never?

278
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:51,209
So young,
and you have lost hope.

279
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:53,210
Ah, this is America,

280
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,906
the place to find hope!

281
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,744
If you give up,

282
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,580
you will never
find your family.

283
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,210
So, never...

284
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:03,345
say...

285
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:04,411
never.

286
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,478
Say...

287
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,422
# Never say never #

288
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,858
#Whatever you do #

289
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,226
# Never say never,
my friend #

290
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:13,229
Henri...

291
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:14,560
<i>Ah, tais-toi!</i>

292
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:18,330
# If you believe that
your dreams will come true #

293
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,837
#They'll come true
in the end #

294
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:21,838
But...

295
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:22,874
Ah ah ah!

296
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,670
# Keep up your courage #

297
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,177
# Don't ever despair #

298
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:31,614
#Take heart
and then count to 10 #

299
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,674
# Hope for the best #

300
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,583
#Work for the rest #

301
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,748
#And never
say never again #

302
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,257
But it's impossible!

303
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:42,759
I'll never
find my family.

304
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:46,286
Never say never.
Don't say that.

305
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,424
# Never say never #

306
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,967
#Whatever you do #

307
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,002
Again.

308
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,764
# Never say never #

309
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:53,770
#To me #

310
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,329
See how easy?

311
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:59,776
# If you believe
you can come
shining through #

312
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:02,780
That's how
it's going to be.

313
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:03,872
Perfect!

314
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:05,940
# Now don't you
go and give up #

315
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:07,746
# Give out or give in #

316
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:10,083
#When the going's rough,
just get tough #

317
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:13,352
#And just tell yourself
you're gonna win #

318
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:17,589
# Remember to look on
the bright side till then #

319
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:19,721
#And never #

320
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,164
# Say never #

321
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,633
#Again #

322
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:28,139
Now are you ready
to go find your family?

323
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:29,298
Yes!

324
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:30,466
Chantal!

325
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,976
Take my friend
to immigration.

326
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:35,979
You will find
your family there.

327
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,981
Everyone goes
through immigration.

328
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:40,483
I would take you myself,

329
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:43,578
but I'd never
finish my statue.

330
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,748
Henri, you said never!

331
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:48,520
Oh, so I did!

332
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,083
# Never #

333
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,892
# Say never #

334
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:54,329
# Never #

335
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:56,765
# Say never #

336
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,632
# Never #

337
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:03,333
# Say never #

338
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:04,841
#Again ##

339
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,343
Au revoir!

340
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:07,844
<i>Bonne chance!</i>

341
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,403
Good luck!

342
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,080
Good-bye!

343
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:30,200
Keep it moving,
keep it moving.

344
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:32,702
Hurry, hurry!

345
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:36,207
Step off the boat
and into prosperity!

346
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:40,040
Welcome, greenhorns!
This is America!

347
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,705
Today's special,
the Brooklyn Bridge,

348
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:44,214
just a dollar!

349
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:46,216
Golly,
the Brooklyn Bridge!

350
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:49,378
Ticket to Chicago!
Used only once!

351
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:51,888
Gee whiz!
Only once, ma.

352
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,892
Get my apple
while it lasts.

353
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,894
Hurry,
it's going fast!

354
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,452
Apple, anyone?

355
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,566
18, 19, 20, 21.

356
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,434
[Cough Cough]

357
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,441
Please put out
that filthy thing.

358
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,636
I'm suffocating
down here.

359
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:16,613
You're not the only
cockroach in New York.

360
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:20,947
Other roaches would love
to work for Warren T. Rat.

361
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,954
Good! Fire me.
I'm fed up...

362
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,957
with that smoke
and this pocket!

363
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,459
I've seen cleaner
kitchen stoves.

364
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,961
All right, Digit.

365
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:34,965
Hey, how much money
did we make today?

366
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,466
Oh.

367
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,968
Well, let's see.

368
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:41,472
7, 9, 4,
carry 1, drop 2.

369
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,474
5 down, 7 up, 98.6...

370
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,306
And 2 plus 2 is 22.

371
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,811
Whoa!

372
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,244
What's the boodle?

373
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:52,647
So far, we have
collected $89 and...

374
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,150
and 13 cents.

375
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,154
We'll get
another 17 from Moe.

376
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:00,055
That's 50 cents

Hey, Tiger...

744
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:34,828
when the boss plays,
it's culture.

745
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:36,331
Sure, culture.

746
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,392
I think it sounds,
uh, melodious.

747
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:44,173
"If music be
the food of love,

748
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:46,801
play on, McDuff,
play on."

749
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,368
I don't know what's worse,

750
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:52,381
the music
or the Shakespeare.

751
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:54,883
Rats! This nose
keeps interfering!

752
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:56,885
You could
stop playing.

753
00:50:56,953 --> 00:50:58,386
Hey, that's funny.

754
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:02,391
I've never known
a cockroach
with good taste,

755
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:05,895
but I've known plenty
that taste... good.

756
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:07,452
Play! Play! Play!

757
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:09,892
Ahem.

758
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:18,698
Ahh!

759
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:20,140
Warren T!

760
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,842
You!

761
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,815
You're not a rat!

762
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:28,316
You're a cat!

763
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:31,320
How did you get in?
Come here!

764
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,988
Awoo!

765
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:36,992
Gentlemen, cat's
out of the bag!

766
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,391
[Crash]

767
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:40,396
Get me that mouse!

768
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:42,295
Let me at him!

769
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:46,301
I'll kill him!
Get out of my way!

770
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:49,361
You just stepped
on my tail!

771
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:04,320
Come here,
you little runt!

772
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:17,892
Get him!

773
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:20,563
Ppllt!

774
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:02,342
Once more.

775
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:04,403
There is the boat.

776
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:08,679
The boat whistle blows
at 6:00 in the morning,

777
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:11,186
and that is when...

778
00:53:11,254 --> 00:53:14,690
we must rewease
the secret weapon!

779
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:16,453
Yeah!
Yay!
Hooray!

780
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:29,271
So the cats
must be here...

781
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:31,773
at 6:00 on the dot,

782
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:34,776
not a moment
before or after.

783
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:37,779
When you go
get the cats,

784
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:42,284
what do you do
to make them come here?

785
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:44,547
# Nyah nyah-nyah
nyah nyah ##

786
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:45,781
Wight!

787
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,789
Now get some sweep.

788
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:50,883
We have a wong day ahead.

789
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:08,537
[Sobbing]

790
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:17,884
Grr! On your guard,
Tiger!

791
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:21,656
Don't make
any funny moves.

792
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:25,161
I have the instinct
of a cat.

793
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:27,753
Wait... I am a cat!

794
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:29,025
[Sobbing]

795
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:32,500
Aw, I didn't mean
to scare you.

796
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:36,005
It's ok, little buddy.
I'm your friend.

797
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:38,506
Aw, come on. Be happy.

798
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:42,636
Oh, come on.
What are you crying for?

799
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:45,112
I have to get
out of here...

800
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:48,309
so I can
find my family.

801
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:50,319
You... lost your family?

802
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:51,479
Mm-hmm.

803
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:53,488
Oh, no.
That's terrible.

804
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:56,992
You know, I lost
my family, too.

805
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,153
[Sob]

806
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:01,163
Years ago, I mean.

807
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:02,391
Eight brothers...

808
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:04,898
10 sisters...

809
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:08,034
three fathers...

810
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:12,433
Don't cry.

811
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:13,999
You'll find them.

812
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,613
Do you really think so?

813
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:20,281
Gee, you're nice.

814
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:23,877
Um, my name is Tiger.
What's yours?

815
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:24,977
Fievel.

816
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:27,023
Fievel Mousekewitz.

817
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:30,959
Listen. I like mice.

818
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:32,460
Waah!

819
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:34,963
Oh, no, not like that.

820
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:37,465
I don't eat red meat.

821
00:55:37,534 --> 00:55:38,967
I'm a vegetarian.

822
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:42,300
Oh, a little fish
now and then.

823
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:46,138
But what I really like
is some... shh...

824
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:47,369
broccoli.

825
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:51,380
I thought cats
were supposed to be mean.

826
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:54,440
Mean? Ha! I am mean!
Grr! Grr!

827
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:59,678
Then... and...
aw, what's the use?

828
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:12,902
I like butterflies
with big golden wings...

829
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:15,403
and blue and green tips.

830
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:16,962
Me, too!

831
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:21,076
I like Swiss cheese
ice cream.

832
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:22,406
Me, too! Me, too!

833
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:24,413
You too, too? Hmm.

834
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:27,143
Wait. What's your
favorite book?

835
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,151
Um, <i>The Brothers</i>
<i>Kara</i>mou<i>sov.</i>

836
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,154
<i>The Brothers...</i>
I can't believe it.

837
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,656
I can't believe it!
Prrr!

838
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:40,419
# I can tell we got an
awful lot in common #

839
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:44,433
# Even though we look
as different as can be #

840
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:46,901
#We don't even
have to try #

841
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,665
#To see things
eye to eye #

842
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:52,834
# It just comes
to us naturally #

# Come to think of it #

844
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:57,175
# I think
we fit together #

845
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:01,240
# Playing cat and mouse
won't get us very far #

Hold your fire.

It's that rat,
Warren T.

913

He's not a rat.
He's a cat.

Pay no attention
to that mouse.

916

Throw down your money
and that kid.

them to stop.

You're wrecking
the plan!

919
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,686
It's not supposed
to happen this way.

920
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,728
Throw down that kid!

01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:35,923
Oh, yeah?

Ho ho ho! You will,
my little American.

1108
01:15:30,392 --> 01:15:35,659
Ha ha ha!
Someday, you will.

1109
01:15:36,632 --> 01:15:37,894
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

1110
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:27,908
# Somewhere out there #

1111
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:33,915
# Beneath
the pale moonlight #

1112
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:39,750
# Someone's
thinking of me #

1113
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:44,815
#And loving me tonight #

1114
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:52,763
# Somewhere out there #

1115
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:57,931
# Someone's
saying a prayer #

1116
01:17:58,006 --> 01:18:03,945
#That we'll
find one another #

1117
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:10,440
# In that big
somewhere out there #

1118
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,612
#And even though
I know #

1119
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:16,283
# How very far apart
we are #

1120
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:18,952
# It helps to think
we might be wishing #

1121
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:21,791
# On the same
bright star #

1122
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:23,797
#And when
the night wind #

1123
01:18:23,865 --> 01:18:27,631
# Starts to sing
a lonesome lullaby #

1124
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:30,297
# It helps to think
we're sleeping #

1125
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:36,800
# Underneath
the same big sky #

1126
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:41,975
# Somewhere out there #

1127
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:45,986
# If love can
see us through #

1128
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:48,648
# Can see us
through #

1129
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:53,821
#Then we'll be together #

1130
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:56,989
# Somewhere out there #

1131
01:18:57,065 --> 01:19:13,505
# Out where dreams
come true ##
