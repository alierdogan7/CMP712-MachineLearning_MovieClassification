The Pride Lands.

3
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,524
Ruling it is a big responsibility, Kiara.

4
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,409
And someday, when you're Queen...

5
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,130
KION: Heads up! Incoming!

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,850
- (GRUNTS)
- Kion!

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,685
Oh! (CHUCKLES) Sorry, Dad.

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,649
Me and Bunga were playing Baobab Ball...

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,167
And Kion couldn't handle the pass!

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,208
What? A giraffe couldn't handle it.

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,691
You kicked it over my head!

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,047
- Kion!
- And you couldn't handle it!

13
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,361

Whoa!

18
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,840
Kion, I need to talk to your sister.

19
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,922
She'll be tracking gazelles
with her friends today.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,207
(CHUCKLES) Because I'm training to be...

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,851
Queen of the Pride Lands. Yeah, yeah.

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,524
I know all about it, Kiara.

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,047
(SCOFFS) Least I have my life figured out.

24
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,970
What are you gonna grow
up to be, little brother?

25
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,566
Happy?

26
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,487
All right, you two, that's enough.

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,086
Kion, why don't you
and Bunga go play somewhere else?

28
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,322
BUNGA: Yeah! I know the perfect place!

29
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,089
Hey, Kion!

30
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,527

You'll never get the baobab fruit, no.

Catch me if you can, Kion!

35
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,611
Game on, Bunga!

36
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,160
Later, Dad.
Have fun tracking those gazelle, Kiara.

37
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,366
I gotta get Bunga!

38
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,681
(SIGHS) I can't believe we're related.

39
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,765
Kion will grow up someday. I hope.

No, no. Most definitely not that.

We have heard your roar! Yes, yes!

176
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,527
Yeah. It was, uh, kind of different today.

177
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,769
Different? Different, you say?

It is more than different.

It is the Roar of the Elders!

181
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,206
When you use it,

182
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,047
the great lions
of the Pride Lands' past roar with you.

183
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,643
What? You mean that's what
happened to my roar?

184
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,121
Yeah, lions in the sky! I saw that!

185
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,164
The Roar of the Elders
is a great gift, Kion.

186
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,404
It will make you the fiercest
animal in the Pride Lands.

187
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,122
- But...
- But what?

188
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,081
No, no, Simba.

189
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,529
It is you who must tell Kion
about the Lion Guard.

190
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,206
The Lion Guard? What's that?

191
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,525
This way, Kion.

192
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,480
Uh, okay.

193
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,763
Oh, come on, Rafiki.
You already know what it is, don'cha?

194
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,729
Come on, tell me.

195
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,121
Huh?

196
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,848
It's a bunch of vines?

197
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,921
Rafiki?

198
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,206
Whoa!

199
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,885
Look at that!

200
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,047
How did I not know this was here?

201
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,690
Dad, what is this place?

202
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,808
This is the Lion Guard Lair.

203
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,850
It's the secret meeting place for
the members of the Lion Guard.

204
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,482
Ugh! Maybe they should think
about fixin' the place up.

205
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,609
(COUGHS) Or at least doing some dusting.

206
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,328
Hmm. Yes.

207
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,761
(CHUCKLES)

208
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,490
Ah! That's more like it.

209
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,450
Can you show that trick
to my Uncle Timon and Uncle Pumbaa?

210
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,726
(CHUCKLES)

211
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,041
Dad, enough with all the secrecy stuff!

212
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,485
You gotta tell me.

213
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,164
What is the Lion Guard?

214
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,523
The Lion Guard is the team
that protects the Pride Lands

215
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,728
and defends the Circle of Life.

216
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,929
According to tradition, the Lion Guard is
made of the Pride Lands'

217
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,530
fiercest, bravest,
fastest, strongest, and keenest of sight.

218
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,529
So what happened to them?

219
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,763
It looks like
they haven't been in here since forever!

220
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,800
I'm afraid it's a story
without a happy ending.

221
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,327
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

222
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,644
SIMBA: When your grandfather
Mufasa was about your age,

223
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,281
his younger brother, Scar,
was leader of the Lion Guard.

224
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,966
Scaralso had the gift of the Roar.

225
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,846
The Roar made Scar feel powerful.

226
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,410
But that power went to Scar's head.

227
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,562
He began to think that he should be king,

228
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,961
instead of his older brother, Mufasa.

229
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,803
So Scar ordered the Lion Guard to help
him take down Mufasa.

230
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,685
When the Guard refused,

231
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,091
Scar was furious.

232
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,041
And then, Scar used the Roar

233
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,248
to destroy the Lion Guard.

234
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,164
What Scar didn't realise

235
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,129
was that by using the Roar for evil,

236
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,042
he would lose the power
of the Roar completely.

237
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,004
Heyvi kabisa.

238
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,081
Yeah.

239
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,970
The Roar is a very powerful gift.

240
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,681
It can be used for great good.

241
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,168
But it can also lead to terrible evil.

242
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,324
Well, I'd never be like Scar. Ever!

243
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,050
I'm glad to hear that, son.

244
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,890
Because starting today,

245
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,043
you are the leader of the new Lion Guard.

246
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,246
I'm the what?

247
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,129
You heard Simba! Ha-ha!

248
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,409
The leader of the new Lion Guard?
It is you!

249
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,131
Yes! It. Is. You!

250
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,921
Dad?

251
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,490
It's true, Kion.

252
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,201
Wow. Amazing!

253
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,284
It is. And now,
as the leader of the Guard,

254
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,762
I need you to assemble
the Pride Lands' bravest,

255
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,322
fastest, strongest, and keenest of sight.

256
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,289
Okay, Dad. Got it!

257
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,927
Don't worry. I'm gonna make you proud!

258
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,641
Yes, Bunga?

259
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,845
This is un-Bunga-Iievable!

260
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,925
You see, Simba?

261
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,844
And now, Kion will choose the best lions

262
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,763
in the Pride for the Guard.

263
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,080
I hope so, Rafiki.

264
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,969
I'm still not sure he's ready.

265
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,289
(BIRDS CAWING)

266
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,127
Wow! Me. Leader of the Lion Guard...

267
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,202
Protectors of the Pride Lands!

268
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,085
It's kinda scary.

269
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,241
- BUNGA: Hey, Kion.
- Huh?

270
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,321
Kion!

271
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,366
Ergh! Bunga!

272
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,442
Ready to start assembling the Lion Guard?

273
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,124
Huh? Now? Yeah? Huh?

274
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,725
Yes! Argh!

275
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,165
Just stop splashing me!

276
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,526
Splashing?

277
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,888
Oh. (CHUCKLES) Sorry, Kion.

278
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,086
Hakuna matata, Bunga. Now, come on!

279
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,406
Time to assemble the Lion Guard!

280
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,605
Lion Guard?

281
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,806
Hmm.

282
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,804
Dad said the Lion Guard needs
the Pride Lands' bravest,

283
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,963
strongest, fastest, and keenest of sight.

284
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,487
So I think I'll go ask the bravest
animal in the Pride Lands first.

285
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,607
Kion, wait!

286
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,761
Before you go asking

287
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,569
whoever you think is the bravest,

288
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,687
think about this...

289
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,923
I might not be the biggest honey badger.

290
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,923
But I know what's in my heart.

291
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,970
And I'm not afraid of anything or anyone!

292
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,610
I know, Bunga. That's why...

293
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,808
I'll help the Lion Guard fight hyenas.

294
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,962
Or jackals, or crocodiles, or vultures!

295
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,041
Vultures?

296
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,009
Or great big rock slides
or wild fires or floods!

297
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,811
I will stand with
the Lion Guard! I'll never give up!

298
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,961
I'll, I'll...

299
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,328
Why don't you stop talking
so I can ask you to join the Lion Guard?

300
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,401
Say what?

301
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,681
Come on, Bunga!

302
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,444
You're the bravest animal I know!

303
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,524
I want you to be
the first to join the new Lion Guard.

304
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,001
Zuka Zama!

305
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,249
Zuka Zama, indeed.

306
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,722
I wonder if Janja knows
about the Lion Guard.

307
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,681
You couldn't have made a better choice.
We're gonna make a great team!

308
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,922
I can't wait
to tell Uncle Timon and Uncle Pumbaa.

309
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,684
(PANICKED SCREAM IN DISTANCE)

310
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,649
Kion! Do you hear that?

311
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,082
ZURI: (STRAINING) A little help?

312
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,764
Sounds like Kiara's friend, Zuri.

313
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,769
And she needs help.

314
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,921
Our help!

315
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,809
It's our first adventure!

316
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,089
Lion Guard to the rescue!

317
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,403
Lion Guard to the rescue?

318
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,562
Hey! Bunga, wait up!

319
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,810
Hold still, Zuri. Timon and Pumbaa
said they know how to help.

320
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,882
(WHINING) Where am I gonna go, Tiifu?

321
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,644
I'm stuck.

322
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,085
(SIGHS) You wouldn't be stuck

323
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,403
if you didn't keep stopping to sharpen
your claws on every other tree.

324
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,326
But Kiara, if I don't
keep them sharp, they don't stay shiny!

325
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,890
TIMON: Don't worry, ladies.

326
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,930
Me and Pumbaa have
everything under control.

327
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,126
Timon's right.

328
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,769
We used to help Simba
get his claws out of logs all the time.

329
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,002
And you're sure about this?

330
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,684
Sure, I'm sure.

331
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,048
If it weren't for us, your dad would still
be stuck to a tree somewhere.

332
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,208
- Ready, Pumbaa?
- Ready!

333
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,044
Okay, on three.

334
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,248
One... Two...

335
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,607
BUNGA: Stand back, Pride Landers!

336
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,769
Bunga of the Lion Guard is here!

337
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,841
What!

338
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,331
- Bunga!
- (ZURI GASPS)

339
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,244
Ow! My claw!

340
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,089
- Whoa!
- (LOUD CRASH)

341
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,366
(ZURI SCREAMING)

342
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,169
Creepy crawly bugs!

343
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,605
- (BUZZING)
- Ew!

344
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,848
Zuri, you hit the jackpot!

345
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,649
It's a smorgasbord!

346
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,091
(MUNCHING)

347
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,402
Hang on, Zuri! I'll save you!

348
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,244
Okay, Bunga.

349
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,448
You've done enough saving for one day.

350
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,602
Bunga, I... Whoa.

351
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,040
What's going on?

352
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,966
Oh! I broke a claw!

353
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,246
It hurts!

354
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,051
There, there, Zuri.
You're gonna be just fine.

355
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,566
Oh, hey, Kiara.
How'd the gazelle tracking go?

356
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,642
(SIGHS) We never got to the gazelles.

357
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,007
Zuri got her claws stuck in a tree.

358
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,802
(LAUGHS) And then she fell face first
into a log full of bugs!

359
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,881
Mmm!

360
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,361
Bugs are so gross.

361
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,967
Mmm.

362
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,088
And so delicious.

363
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,161
Ooh, look.

364
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,286
- Another one.
- (SCREAMS)

365
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,731
Get it, get it away!

366
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,211
(CONTINUES SCREAMING)

367
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,930
Ow, my paw!

368
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,605
(SOBBING)

369
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,880
Hey, everyone. Everyone. Listen to this!

370
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,281
Simba just put Kion

371
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,170
in charge of the new Lion Guard!

372
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,526
Lion Guard?

373
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,726
What's a Lion Guard?

374
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,325
Dad just told me about it.

375
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,686
The Lion Guard is the team

376
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,000
that protects the Pride Lands

377
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,128
and defends the Circle of Life.

378
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,009
And I'm its new leader.

379
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,809
I'm gonna be on the Lion Guard, too.

380
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,247
It's un-Bunga-Iievable!

381
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,129
(CHUCKLES) You and Bunga?

382
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,043
Protecting the Pride Lands?

383
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,282
Does Dad know about this?

384
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,489
Dad told me to assemble
the Pride Lands' best.

385
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,608
And I'm the best. Just ask me.

386
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,763
Well, if you ask me,
it sounds like it might be dangerous.

387
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,842
It's worse than that, Pumbaa.

388
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,968
It sounds like work.

389
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,247
Yeah! It's both!

390
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,924
Eek... Work!

391
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,207
Gee, Bunga. I don't know...

392
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,363
Uncle Pumbaa, Uncle Timon, please?

393
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,251
Work? Danger? Definitely not.

394
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,767
Have you forgotten our
problem-free philosophy?

395
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,444
It means no worries...

396
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,285
I know it's not
Hakuna matata, Uncle Timon.

397
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,966
It's... It's Zuka Zama!

398
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,121
Zuka Zama?

399
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,681
Don't ask!

400
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,330
What's Zuka Zama?

401
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,041
What's Zuka Zama? What's Zuka Zama?

402
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,929
I'll tell you all about Zuka Zama!

403
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,570
You had to ask.

404
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,408
(SINGING) Zuka Zama

Ah! Zuka palooka.

455
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,846
I still don't think Bunga should be
signing up for some jungle patrol.

456
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,207
- Lion Guard!
- Whatever you call it.

457
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,169
Timon, Pumbaa, please.

458
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,163
I really do need Bunga on the Lion Guard.

459
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,049
He's the bravest animal I know.

460
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,688
Bravest animal you know?

461
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,410
He's brave, all right.

462
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,289
Brave bordering on stupid.

463
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,407
Thanks, Kiara!

464
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,403
Well, when you put it that way...

465
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,443
Congratulations, Bunga!

466
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,522
We always knew you had it in you!

467
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,330
Oh, brother!

468
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,643
Kion's gonna wreck the Pride Lands
before I even get to be Queen.

469
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,961
Oh, Bunga. I'm so proud, I could...

470
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,565
(BREAKS WIND)

471
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,687
Oops.

472
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,287
Sorry.

473
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,161
Zuri, let's get you back to Pride Rock.

474
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,446
We're outta here!

475
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,522
I better go assemble the rest of my team.

476
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,968
Wait, Kion! The Lion Guard
needs to stick together!

477
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,129
Was it something I said?

478
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,730
Janja, I'm hungry!

479
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,006
Me, too!

480
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,321
You two only have yourselves to blame.

481
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,563
To think that you were scared
by the roar of a lion cub!

482
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,564
Janja, see, Kion's roar...

483
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,086
It wasn't like, like a normal roar.

484
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,084
It was, uh... (NERVOUS LAUGH)

485
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,969
Super loud!

486
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,929
And the clouds!

487
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,480
They turned into roaring lions!

488
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,203
Oh! So you're scared of clouds, too?

489
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,770
(LAUGHING)

490
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,966
Stuff it, fur brains!

491
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,408
Seems we have a visitor
to our humble, humid den.

492
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,687
Janja. Hyenas.

493
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,367
Mzingo! What are you doing
this far into the Outlands?

494
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,771
Looking for leftovers?

495
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,087
No, but I'd be happy to eat...

496
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,162
Forget it. We don't have any.

497
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,403
Simba's cub, Kion,
managed to cancel our lunch plans.

498
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,925
(LAUGHING)

499
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,526
Then you already know about Kion.

500
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,840
Know what?

501
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,642
Simba has told Kion
to assemble a new Lion Guard.

502
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,371
Lion Guard? That's impossible.

503
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,091
The Lion Guard died out after Scar...

504
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,846
Unless...

505
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,446
(STAMMERS) Janja?

506
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,091
The Roar. Of course!

507
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,400
Of course, what?

508
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,005
Don't you know the stories?

509
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,003
The Lion Guard was legendary.

510
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,482
The most powerful team
of lions in the Pride Lands.

511
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,406
At least they were... (SNICKERING)

512
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,245
Until Scar destroyed them!

513
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,651
(LAUGHING)

514
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,604
What? A lion destroyed the Lion Guard?

515
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,284
Or so the story goes.

516
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,807
Ha-ha-ha! Hilarious!

517
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,929
Yeah! Them lions ain't too bright!

518
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,764
Stuff it, fur brains!

519
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,204
A new Lion Guard
could be very bad news for us hyenas.

520
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,408
And all the other Outlanders.

521
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,643
I gathered as much
from what I overheard from Kion.

522
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,486
Yes. The old Lion Guard
protected the so-called

523
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,244
Circle of Life.

524
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,881
If Kion's new Lion Guard wins
the trust of the Pride Lands,

525
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,883
we Outlanders will...

526
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,405
(GROWLS)

527
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,210
(HYENAS LAUGHING)

528
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,682
Now, Janja. What were you saying

529
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,764
about the Lion Guard and the Outlanders?

530
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,080
I was saying,

531
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,401
with a Lion Guard
patrolling the Pride Lands,

532
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,006
it will be next to impossible
for us Outlanders

533
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,242
to take whatever animals we want for food.

534
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,044
Then what are we gonna do?

535
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,043
Ooh, we could eat each other.

536
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,487
No, we'll strike now,

537
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,006
before the Lion Guard is ready.

538
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,084
And we'll take down
all the animals we can.

539
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,447
Mmm. I like the sound of that.

540
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,329
Whole herds of animals!

541
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,681
- Yeah, right!
- Tasty!

542
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,010
Tonight, we Outlanders will feast.

543
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,128
Hyenas and vultures alike!

544
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,090
Tonight, we strike!

545
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,605
(LAUGHING)

546
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,242
(SINGING) When you live in the Outlands

547
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,721
It's better to make your own rules

548
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,962
Ask anyone outside the Pride Lands

549
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,886
The Circle of Life is for fools

550
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,724
(VOCALISING)

551
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,761
We go where we want when we want to

552
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,241
And we eat
Yes, we eat as we please

553
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,721
That Kion can't give us a curfew

554
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,768
Or tell us to stay in the trees

555
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,806
Tonight, we strike
Tonight, we strike

556
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,167
No one's safe
So the time is right

557
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,561
The Circle of Life's gonna feel our bite

558
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,166
Tonight, we strike
Tonight, we strike

559
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,526
(VOCALISING)

560
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,808
So before this new Guard is ready

561
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,486
To defend the Pride Lands from harm

562
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,642
We'll make them all feel unsteady

563
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,041
We'll give them cause for alarm

564
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,090
Tonight, we strike
Tonight, we strike

565
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,401
No one's safe
So the time is right

566
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,687
The Circle of Life's gonna feel our bite

567
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,161
Tonight, we strike
Tonight, we strike

568
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,450
(LAUGHING)

569
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,007
All right, fellas, bring it in.

570
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,845
Here's the plan.

571
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,890
While the animals are in their slumber

572
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,042
We'll be creeping beneath

573
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,441
And just like a roaring thunder

574
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,046
We will wake them up with our teeth

575
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,282
Tonight, we strike
Tonight, we strike

576
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,806
No one's safe
So the time is right

577
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,201
The Circle of Life's gonna feel our bite

578
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,760
Tonight, we strike
Tonight, we strike

579
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,241
- Tonight, we strike
- Tonight, we strike!

580
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,401
No one's safe
So the time is right

581
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,527
Nobody is safe!

582
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,080
The Circle of Life's gonna feel our bite

583
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,447
Tonight, we strike
Tonight, we strike

584
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,887
The Circle of Life's gonna feel our bite

585
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,247
Tonight, we strike
Tonight, we strike

586
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,090
Outlanders, arise and follow me!

587
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,607
The Pride Lands will never
know what bit them!

588
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,409
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

589
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,046
Target in sight.

590
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,361
Dive!

591
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,411
Hey, Ono!

592
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,164
(GRUNTS) Whoa!

593
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,009
Oh. Hi, Kion.

594
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,081
Good to see you.

595
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,242
You see just about everything, Ono.

596
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,970
That's why I want to talk.

597
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,205
ALL: (CHANTING) Beshte! Beshte! Beshte!

598
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,965
Hey, everybody! Who wants a water slide?

599
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,690
- Ooh, yeah!
- Me, me!

600
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,886
Do it, Beshte!

601
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,964
Poa. One water slide, coming up!

602
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,925
(SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE)

603
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,047
(GRUNTS)

604
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,641
ALL: Yay!

605
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,921
Yeah!

606
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,926
(LAUGHS)

607
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,767
Strongest?

608
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,887
(BLOWS RASPBERRIES) Strongest.

609
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,086
Also wettest.

610
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,890
- Aah!
- Ono!

611
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,007
Fuli, wait! Kion wants to talk!

612
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,844
Not now, Bunga. I gotta run.

613
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,046
What? Why?

614
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,281
(PANTING) That's why.

615
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,604
(SCREECHING)

616
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,081
Oh.

617
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,402
I see Fuli's a bit occupied.

618
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,370
Even I can see that, Ono.
But I have an idea.

619
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,161
Whoo!

620
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,480
Huwezi!

621
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,485
You can't catch me!

622
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,005
Fuli! This way!

623
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,481
Fuli! Jump!

624
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,125
Beshte! Now!

625
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,284
Nice save, Beshte.

626
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,681
(PANTING) Totally. Thanks.

627
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,923
And as for you guys, I said I'm sorry!

628
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,764
I wasn't trying to be mean when I said

629
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,842
you look funny when
you scratch your heads.

630
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,769
Apology accepted.

631
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,410
(ALL GROAN)

632
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,248
Hey, guys. Thanks for meeting with me.

633
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,368
I wanted to talk to you because...

634
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,169
Well, I need your help.

635
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,890
What's the kerbubble, Kion?

636
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,201
The five of us are
the Pride Lands' fiercest,

637
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,208
bravest, strongest, fastest
and keenest of sight.

638
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,601
And that's why I want you all to join

639
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,364
the new Lion Guard.

640
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,602
Together, we'll protect the Pride Lands

641
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,409
and defend the Circle of Life.

642
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,481
(WHISTLES)

643
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,848
Well, lick my tail and call me a meerkat!

644
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,008
Hey! My uncle's a meerkat!

645
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,810
No offence, Bunga.

646
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,848
Wait! Aren't you a honey badger?

647
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,483
A Lion Guard?

648
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,607
Figures.

649
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,162
Always the lions lording
over the Pride Lands.

650
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,086
I suppose Simba put you in charge
of this little team, Kion?

651
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,924
You bet your spots he did!

652
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,290
Fuli, the Lion Guard needs you.

653
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,646
You're the Pride Lands' fastest.

654
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,960
You got that right.

655
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,611
And you're supposed to be the fiercest?

656
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,250
Well, he is a lion.

657
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,924
And lions are fierce.

658
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,570
It's kinda common knowledge, really.

659
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,001
Show 'em the Roar, Kion.
Show 'em the Roar!

660
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,162
What's Bunga talking about? The Roar?

661
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,884
You think you're somethin' special
just 'cause you can roar?

662
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,681
Wait 'till you hear it. C'mon, Kion.

663
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,841
Show 'em the Roar!

664
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,605
So what is the deal with your roar?

665
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,724
Oh, you totally have to show us, Kion.

666
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,325
Seeing is believing!

667
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,004
Though with a roar,
it's more about hearing.

668
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,611
Okay, fine. I'll show you the Roar.

669
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,047
Just, uh, stay behind me.

670
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,565
I don't want anybody to get hurt.

671
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,009
- Excuse me.
- Watch it!

672
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,525
Pfft. Groundlings.

673
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,407
Ready?

674
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,205
Okay. This is the Roar...

675
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,725
(TINY SQUEAK)

676
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,484
What in the Pride Lands...

677
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,324
That was... Different.

678
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,642
(LAUGHS) Kion!

679
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,405
You call that a roar? (CHUCKLES)

680
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,050
Didn't sound like a roar.

681
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,090
That wasn't the Roar! That was a squeak!

682
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,810
I've found him, Your Highness!

683
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,086
Kion is over here!

684
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,283
See, Dad? What did I tell you?

685
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,441
Thank you, Kiara.

686
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,682
You and Tiifu go ahead
and track the gazelle.

687
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,888
I need to talk with Kion. Alone.

688
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,961
Yes, Dad.

689
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,451
Thank you, princess.

690
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,761
Dad! Am I glad to see you!

691
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,444
I'm not sure why, but when I tried to...

692
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,491
Kion, Kiara tells me you've asked
Bunga to join the Lion Guard.

693
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,121
Hey.

694
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,526
Is this true?

695
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,965
Well, yeah.

696
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,202
I was just talking to
all my friends about it.

697
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,406
Your friends?

698
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,121
Kion, I asked you to assemble
the new Lion Guard.

699
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,680
Instead you're just
playing with your friends?

700
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,000
I'm not playing, Dad.

701
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,889
My friends are the new Lion Guard.

702
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,405
Fuli is the fastest.

703
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,925
Beshte is the strongest.

704
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,764
Ono is the keenest of sight.

705
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,320
And the bravest, it's Bunga.

706
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,764
Kion, the Lion Guard
has always been made of lions.

707
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,242
Do you really
think a Lion Guard with only one lion

708
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,651
can protect the Pride Lands?

709
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,886
Well, actually...

710
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,961
Son, listen.

711
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,169
The Lion Guard isn't
a game you play with your friends.

712
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,321
It's real.

713
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,607
The Circle of Life, and your life,

714
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,762
will depend on who's on your team.

715
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,887
Please, Kion.

716
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,247
There are plenty of
good lions for the Guard.

717
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:42,160
I need you to take your
new responsibility seriously.

718
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,561
Just as seriously as Kiara takes hers.

719
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,322
But I do take it seriously.

720
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,767
Kion...

721
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,401
Little B, I think Kion needs
some time to himself.

722
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,930
KIARA: Be sure to stay low
while we're tracking the herd.

723
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,970
And we need stay downwind,
so they don't catch our scent.

724
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,170
That's why it's important
to watch how the grass moves.

725
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,403
Are we going to attack them?

726
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,844
No. My dad says we should only
take what the pride needs,

727
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,684
to keep the Circle of Life in balance.

728
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,445
If we took down gazelles
just to learn how to do it,

729
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,243
pretty soon there wouldn't be any left.
Then we'd be as bad as the hyenas.

730
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,367
(GASPS)

731
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,449
What's Mzingo doing up there?

732
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,842
Vultures only circle like that
when they're expecting to eat.

733
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,160
Kiara, look!

734
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,960
KIARA: Hyenas. And Janja's leading them.

735
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,690
TIIFU: There's so many of them!

736
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,282
Yeah. And with Mzingo
circling over the gazelles,

737
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,363
I have a feeling they're up to no good.

738
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,930
What are we going to do?

739
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,685
Go find my dad
and tell him Janja and his clan are here.

740
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,091
I'll stay here and keep watch.

741
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,288
Okay, Kiara. Be careful!

742
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,007
Dad wanted the best for the Lion Guard.

743
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,570
And I found them.

744
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,120
But now, maybe the best isn't good enough?

745
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,324
I just don't understand.

746
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,027
(SINGING) Why?

747
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,410
Why even trust me at all?

748
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,167
They say the Guard is my call

749
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,043
But then come tell me I'm wrong

750
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,602
Now what
What should I do?

751
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,602
And who
Who do I turn to?

752
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,767
Now everything feels so upside down

753
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,650
Deep down, maybe I knew

754
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,369
It was way too good to be true

755
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,242
With all my friends looking up to me

756
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,606
Some leader I turned out to be

757
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,727
Kion!

758
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,525
Heyvi kabisa. Are you...

759
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,127
Yes, Kion. I am your grandfather.

760
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,891
Mufasa.

761
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,803
I've heard a lot about you.

762
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,326
And I've been watching you.

763
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,121
You are about to embark
on a great journey, Kion,

764
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,010
leader of the Lion Guard!

765
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,448
I'm not sure Dad's
gonna let me lead the Lion Guard.

766
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,488
He's worried that I can't handle it.

767
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,846
Kion.

768
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,604
Simba is worried.

769
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,490
But he's worried because he loves you.

770
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:38,165
Being leader of the Lion Guard
will not always be easy.

771
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,164
Then maybe Dad's right.

772
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,810
Maybe I'm not ready to lead.

773
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,120
Or use the Roar.

774
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,123
I'm not even sure I can control it!

775
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,931
First, it's super loud.
Then it's just a squeak.

776
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,081
And I...

777
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,003
I don't want to end up like Scar.

778
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,242
Don't be afraid, Kion.

779
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,288
Trust your instincts.

780
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,484
The Roar will be there
for you when you need it.

781
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,604
And so will I.

782
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,763
Until the Pride Lands' end.

783
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,371
Grandfather Mufasa. Don't go yet.

784
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,811
Trust my instincts.

785
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,042
The Roar will be there when I need it.

786
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,601
Maybe my journey is far from done

787
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,843
They need a leader and I'm the one

788
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,047
So now it's time for them all to see

789
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,764
The Lion I was born to be

790
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,411
It is time

791
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,291
To take the lead on my own

792
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:44,091
It is time for
something bigger than I've ever known

793
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,643
No need to wonder
The choice is done

794
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,682
Now I believe I'm truly am the one

795
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,845
So is it time?

796
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,411
Is it time?

797
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,562
Yes.

798
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,526
It is time

799
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,642
Kion! Kion! Janja! The hyenas!

800
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,210
They're attacking the gazelles!

801
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,566
What? Oh, no!

802
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,650
Mzingo's telling the hyenas
which one to target next.

803
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,769
Smart, in a devious sort of way.

804
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,887
I don't get it.

805
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,610
They've already scored a couple gazelles.

806
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,409
That should be plenty for all of them.

807
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,290
Yeah. Why are they still attacking?

808
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,603
Janja and his clan will keep going
until the whole herd is dead.

809
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,681
- What?
- No.

810
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,047
Don't they understand the Circle of Life?

811
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,043
They don't care about the Circle of Life.

812
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,164
They're not hunting for food.

813
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,561
They want to throw
the Pride Lands into chaos.

814
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,286
And it's up to the Lion Guard
to stop them!

815
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,361
The Lion Guard?

816
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,441
You mean us?

817
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,045
What about what Simba said?

818
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,849
So what if we're not all lions?

819
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,163

fiercest, bravest,

- That's true.
- Of course we are.

822
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,486
I guess?

823
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,644
Yeah! Let's go get those stinkin' hyenas!

824
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,087
Hold it, Bunga. This isn't a game.

825
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,447
We need a plan to take on the hyenas.

826
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,363
And I think I have one.

827
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,968
That is, if the rest
of you are ready to join the Lion Guard.

00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,604
Never had one, Kiara!

895
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,364
Now, if you don't mind...

896
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,363
Scram ya, goofy gazelles!

897
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,885
Take this!

898
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,205
(HISSING)

899
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,649
Uncle Pumbaa taught me that one.

900
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,007
(COUGHS) Thanks, Bunga.

901
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:50,084
You might be stinky,
but you sure are brave.

902
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,527
Kion! Bunga and Fuli did it!

903
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,766
Kiara's safe!

904
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,764
Great! Have them
regroup with us at the edge of the field.

905
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,849
It's time to give Janja and his hyenas

906
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,763
something to remember.

907
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,528
- Mom! Dad!
- Kiara!

908
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,965
You're safe.

909
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,520
I might not be if it weren't
for Kion and his friends.

910
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,410
I guess he knew what he was
doing when he picked them.

911
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,764
He did, didn't he?

912
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,490
Look! Look!

913
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,809
Well, if it isn't Kion the lion cub.

914
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,243
You and your friends better leave now,

915
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,288
before you get hurt.

916
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,488
We're the Lion Guard, Janja.

917
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,888
We defend the Circle of Life.

918
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,009
You and your kind are not
welcome in the Pride Lands.

919
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,127
Ever!

920
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,408
(ROARS LOUDLY)

921
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,563
(HYENAS SHOUTING)

922
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,131
Zuka Zama! Now that's the Roar!

923
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,927
Oh!

924
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,331
Did you hear that?

925
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,401
Kion.

926
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,606
Whoa.

927
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,371
(YELPING)

928
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,049
You win today, Kion.

929
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,166
Next time won't be so easy.

930
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,044
See, Simba? You see?

931
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,561
Huh?

932
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,680
He is ready! It is time!

933
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,010
- Simba?
- Yes.

934
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,525
Kion is ready.

935
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,651
It is time.

936
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,328
SIMBA: Time for the Lion Guard.

937
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,687
(SINGING) There's a time in life
when you may get a great calling

938
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:47,606
And it seems so big at times
you feel like you may be falling

939
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,048
If you believe in who you are
there's no need to go running

940
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,811
You found a place with your friends
The adventures keep on coming

941
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,245
(CHORUS VOCALISING)

942
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,651
For the Pride Lands

943
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,290
They're united

944
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,284
The Roaris on guard
Last time it was Simba

945
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,203
Looking after the Pride Lands

946
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,123
Staying strong and united

947
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,761
And no matter where we stand
We'll never be divided

948
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,640
Roar of the lions in the sky
Always keeping a watchful eye

949
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,529
Fierce, fast and brave and strong

950
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,364
Look out
Here comes the Lion Guard

951
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,329
(CHORUS VOCALISING)

952
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,207
Look out
Here comes the Lion Guard
