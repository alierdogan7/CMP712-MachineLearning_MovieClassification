1
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:56,771
This is lovely city harbor
in the year 1900,

2
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,508
when the Australia
was still thought of

3
00:01:58,651 --> 00:01:59,777
by the rest of the world

4
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,217
as the home
of the bush and boomerang.

5
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,947
But with the
growing town of Sydney,

6
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,489
culture had moved in.

7
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,991
And the sounds of those
three famous B's

8
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,028
Bach, Brahms and Beethoven,

9
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:12,654
were being
heard here in the land.

10
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:50,266
Mozart is very quiet
and you hear, isn't it?

11
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,595
Oh-ho, Daddy.

12
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:17,955
Baby, you mustn't
be envious of the others.

13
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,792
I know how much
you would like to be out there

14
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,833
playing and dancing,

15
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:25,529
but music can be a source
of happiness, too.

16
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,197
It's given me great happiness.

17
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,467
Yes, Daddy.

18
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:32,510
That's my girl.

19
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:59,832
No. C-shape, Mr. Kramer. C-sharp.

20
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:06,205
Mr. Kellerman, Annette is gone.
She has disappeared again.

21
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,644
But I just left her upstairs.

22
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,147
Excuse me, Mr. Kramer, will you?

23
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:13,715
I can't understand.

24
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,218
Where the world
is that child wandered?

25
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:18,085
Mr. Kellerman, I can not
look out after her every minute

26
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,192
and take care of the house
at the same time.

27
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:21,452
I have my chores...
Mary, please,

28
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,151
I'm not blaming you.

29
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:23,929
Tell Mr. Kramer
I'll be back shortly.

30
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:27,555
I'm going to find out once and
for all where that child goes.

31
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:46,516
Annette.

32
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,695
Annette.

33
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,600
Annette.

34
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:08,400
Annette, what are you doing?

35
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,668
Hello, Daddy.

36
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,711
Annette,
you come right back here.

37
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,141
Come right back here.

38
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:31,792
Annette, my baby.

39
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:36,425
In heaven's name,
whatever possess you?

40
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:37,797
You might have drowned.

41
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,234
I can't drown, Daddy.

42
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:43,202
And why not?
Because I've learned to swim.

43
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,538
Is this where you've been
coming everyday?

44
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,009
Yes.

45
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:50,240
Darling, I've got to be
very cross with you.

46
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,941
You know what the doctors said,

47
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,553
that your legs would never
be strong enough for...

48
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,177
for what other children do.

49
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,812
But my legs are strong.

50
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:00,152
The strongest ever since
I've been sick.

51
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:05,424
I can even walk better
and without my braces. Watch.

52
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,598
Swimming can't hurt me.

53
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:18,871
How can anything hurt
when it makes you feel so good.

54
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:24,777
Please let me come back here
and swim again.

55
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:29,952
Darling, we'll come back here
and swim everyday.

56
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,583
By your victory today,
Miss Kellerman,

57
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:44,161
you attain permanent
possession of this trophy.

58
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,194
Emblematic of the amateur
freestyle championship

59
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,797
of New South Wales.

60
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,234
Thank you.

61
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,998
This is getting to
be a habit, Annette.

62
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,767
What are you
going to do with all these cups?

63
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,172
They're crowding Dad
right out of his study.

64
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,116
This is a blow to us,
Mr. Kellerman.

65
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,120
I knew you'd understand.
Only too well, Mrs. Grays.

66
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,861
This financial crisis
has affected all of us.

67
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,965
I hope that John won't have to
give up his music permanently.

68
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,466
I hope not. Good bye.
Good bye, Mr. Kellerman.

69
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,367
Good bye.
Good bye. Good luck.

70
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,440
Dad? Look.

71
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:32,874
The amateur championship.
Permanent possession.

72
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:36,675
Wonderful, darling.
I'm so proud of you.

73
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,182
Yeah, why does it
always have to be a cup?

74
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,684
We could use a new key service.

75
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,652
I'll fix some tea.
Would you like some?

76
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:49,851
No, I don't think so. Thank you.

77
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:55,059
Annette, I'm closing
the conservatory.

78
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,967
The few pupils
we have left hardly pay expenses.

79
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,299
Dad.

80
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,873
No... We're not charity cases yet.

81
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:03,805
I wrote my old friend,

82
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,673
Thomas Crocker of
Crocker Conservatory in London.

83
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:09,144
He has offered me a post
as his assistant.

84
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,877
It's a big move for all of us,

85
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,113
but I know there are times
when we have to make decisions.

86
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:19,315
This is the biggest
decision of my life.

87
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,154
Dad, if it's money,
you don't have to.

88
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:25,624
I could teach swimming
or maybe even turn professional.

89
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,359
There were nearly a thousand
people there at the place...

90
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:29,832
Darling, swimming is your hobby

91
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,937
and I want it
to remain just that.

92
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,835
It has blessed you with good
health and this I'm grateful.

93
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:40,435
But as a career, no,
your music and ballet come first.

94
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,105
London will give you the chance
to go on with your studies.

95
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,446
It may be the best thing
for both of us.

96
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:52,188
Well, in that case, what's
everyone looking so gloom about.

97
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:56,625
One thing I know, Dad,
the Kellermans will always win.

98
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,753
Oh, yes.

99
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,576
Come on, Dad.
Let's walk some more.

100
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:25,020
Bet you have me around this
deck six times since breakfast.

101
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:26,522
You're acting like an old man.

102
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,684
I am an old man.

103
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,196
Hold it, city. Hold it, city boy.

104
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:36,024
Wait a minute. Oh, my God.

105
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:39,569
Wait, come back. Wait, come back.

106
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:44,199
What? Hold it. Wait. Hold. Hold.

107
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,841
Hold on, folks.
That's a boy.

108
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:51,678
Wait.

109
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,521
Wait a minute, Sydney.

110
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,387
Whatcha know.
Wait till I get my dentist bill.

111
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,152
What did I tell you?

112
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:02,487
He's got the greatest left hand
in the business.

113
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:04,061
Dynamite and bullfist.

114
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,959
I'm sorry, folks. I hope
he didn't scare you too much

115
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:08,430
but Sydney get the old feeling
that there's old thing down there.

116
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:09,932
What's going on here?

117
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,764
Did you take that Roo
out of the hold again?

118
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:13,064
Look, purser. I assure you...

119
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:16,402
Don't bother to assure me.
I warned you repeatedly.

120
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,238
Sherif and
I had quite enough of you.

121
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,503
That piece is a menace.

122
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:20,942
Only if the pricing, I assure you

123
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,708
The pricing is a killer
but out of the ring, why,

124
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,680
he's as gentle as a lamb.
I tell you...

125
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,378
I tell you.
You keep that beast below deck

126
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,920
or I'll put him
off the next port.

127
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:30,920
And you with him.

128
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,525
Don't look at me,
this thing ain't my idea.

129
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,217
Take him below, Doc.

130
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,259
Now look here, you.

131
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:39,224
You hit me once more when
I ain't looking so help me up,

132
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,562
I'll pick you right in the pouch.
Now, come on. Behave yourself.

133
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,897
And keep him there.

134
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,629
Man and humanity.

135
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,262
I hope they haven't
scare you too much.

136
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:51,171
No. I'm very fond of kangaroo.

137
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,868
You say he boxes.

138
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,604
Boxes? Let me tell you something.

139
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,271
This is the greatest act
I ever uncovered.

140
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:57,245
Why, if Sydney's a man,

141
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,214
he'd be the next champion.
Take my word for it.

142
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:00,010
We have no reason not to.

143
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:01,779
Sure, he's risky
and full of energy

144
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,912
but out of the ring, why,
he wouldn't hurt a flee.

145
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,149
Your friend doesn't
seem to think so.

146
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,386
Doctor? Doc does take things
too seriously.

147
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:10,792
He's been
training fighters for years,

148
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,023
he expects kangaroo
to act the same way.

149
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:14,097
As a matter of fact, we were both

150
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,167
starting with fighter
when we first met Sydney,

151
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,361
a middleweight named
Tiger Driscold.

152
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,665
We offer a bonus for anybody
who'd go two rounds with him.

153
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,366
One day, this fellow
came along leading the kangaroo.

154
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,875
One punch, just one punch match,

155
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,774
a half of everything
I had to buy.

156
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,711
Well, let's hope your
investment proofs a sound risk.

157
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,717
Thanks. I have a hunch for
blue chip this time.

158
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,185
Are you bound to London, too?

159
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,218
Yes, if this boat
ever gets there.

160
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:39,684
This is my daughter's
first visit.

161
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:41,850
She's going to
study for the ballet.

162
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,224
In honor of that, you must be
my guest in Sydney's opening.

163
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,157
Look me up personally,
no charges.

164
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:47,265
That's very nice of you.
Thank you.

165
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,560
Just ask for Jimmy Sullivan.
James Sullivan,

166
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,966
proprietor
of Sullivan's wonder ship.

167
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,904
I'm Frederick Kellerman and
this is my daughter, Annette.

168
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,805
Annette Kellerman.
You're the swimmer.

169
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,571
Show your picture in the paper.

170
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,044
That was an awful picture.

171
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,341
My daughter had just won the

172
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:06,144
amateur freestyle championship
of the New South Wales.

173
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,480
Set a new record in the presence
of two thousand people.

174
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,714
Dad. You did.

175
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:12,016
That's a lot of people.

176
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:15,093
Swimming is very popular now
in Australia.

177
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,218
I can understand why.

178
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:22,357
Well, nice to meet you,
Mr. Sullivan.

179
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,492
I hope Sydney's a big success.

180
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,628
Thanks.

181
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,515
Let me call you sweetheart.

182
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:48,151
I'm in love with you.

183
00:13:48,294 --> 00:14:02,903
Let me hear you whisper
that you love me, too.

184
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:20,147
If to all my going
in your arms all true,

185
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:27,126
let me call you sweetheart.

186
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,233
I'm in love with you.

187
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,796
Forgive the intrusion,

188
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:32,995
would you be interested
in shipboard romance?

189
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:34,230
Hello.
I've been standing over there

190
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,474
watching you for
the past ten minutes.

191
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:40,067
I know. Women always know
when men are watching.

192
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,737
Then maybe you noticed
the puzzle look on my face.

193
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,213
And I keep asking myself

194
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:47,644
how a girl pretty as you
can break swimming records,

195
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:50,152
and how a girl
who can break swimming records

196
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,053
and insists on
ballet dancing as a career.

197
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,092
What's wrong with a ballet?
I don't know.

198
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,251
I guess I've always
associated it

199
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,257
with long hair and swans...

200
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,764
And I'm more the desk class?
No. What I mean is,

201
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:06,167
Whatever type you are,
it must be my type.

202
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:07,829
I meet the girl
for the first time two days ago

203
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,668
and I can't get her
out of my mind.

204
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:12,174
I keep saying to myself.
Sullivan, this is without a doubt

205
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,378
the prettiest girl
you've ever met.

206
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,811
And a voice come back,

207
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,746
nonesense, it's a tropical night
and the stars.

208
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:21,444
You have jungle blood.
And then I replied,

209
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,679
but you have seen
tropical nights before

210
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,686
and you don't have
hot jungle blood.

211
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,415
You're just a
crazy Irish man from Boston

212
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:27,616
who runs the carnival.

213
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,694
And what reply
did you get from that?

214
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:32,490
None. I'm on my own now.

215
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,223
Annette,
please don't think I'm forward

216
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,967
but there's something
I must ask you.

217
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,469
There's something
that I must get off my chest.

218
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,403
Yes?

219
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:46,672
Annette, I want to marry you.

220
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:49,804
Marriage? Did you say marriage?

221
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,179
Yes.

222
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,216
What's the matter?

223
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,850
Nothing. I'm sorry.

224
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,818
Look, I know a fit
when I see one.

225
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,753
If two thousand people
would come to see you in Sydney,

226
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,485
five thousand, ten thousand
would pay to see you in London.

227
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,992
I'll give the afternoon
twist a little zip.

228
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,323
Not just swimming.
I can see it now.

229
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,922
Annette Kellerman,
the Australian mermaid.

230
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,058
Half woman half fish.

231
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,464
I'll build you a little tank
and make you up

232
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,628
to look like a real mermaid
with skilly fin and all.

233
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,171
Well, you may be a bigger draw
than the kangaroo.

234
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,169
I doubt it. Good evening.

235
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,841
Mr. Sullivan,
for your information,

236
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,469
my daughter is not
half woman half fish.

237
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,171
She is, I assure you, all woman.

238
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,506
I couldn't agree with you more.

239
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,117
Furthermore,
she is not interested in swimming

240
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,809
either professionally
or as a career,

241
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:30,786
nor diving into a tank
nor wearing a mermaid's tail.

242
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:33,483
Her soul interest is the ballet,
mine's the music.

243
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,489
But, Mr. Keller...
I don't' wish to...

244
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:35,183
...discuss it any further.

245
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,485
But, look.
This is the greatest idea...

246
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:40,395
Jimmy.
What's the matter?

247
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,932
It's Sydney.
He broke loose again.

248
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,796
Where is he now?
Up at the Captain's bridge.

249
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:47,167
Holy smoke. It'll be a wreck.

250
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:50,207
Attention.

251
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,704
Hold it still, Captain.

252
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,753
But I don't understand.

253
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:06,949
Is there no one running
the conservatory now?

254
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:10,619
No one, sir.
I'm the only one here.

255
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,788
Since poor Mr. Crooper died.

256
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,798
They just closed the place down.

257
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:21,531
I see. Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

258
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,445
Annette,
I don't know what to say.

259
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,746
Most of our funds
were for passage.

260
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,413
It's only one gate
is closed, Dad.

261
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:42,789
Don't worry,
the Kellermans will always eat.

262
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:53,662
Three, four, five.
That's one pound five.

263
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,535
There you are, Miss.

264
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,471
Thank you, Mr. Davis.

265
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:01,136
It's a real big one this time.

266
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,076
I was wondering,

267
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:08,152
you don't have any connections
in the ballet, did you?

268
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,779
Yes, dozens of connections.

269
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,394
Thank you again, Mr. Davis.

270
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,498
Good luck.

271
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,227
Greetings.

272
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,165
Jimmy and Doc.
Hi ya, Miss.

273
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,494
I'm glad to see you.

274
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:03,039
We just drop by to brush up
on our piano lessons.

275
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,699
Won't you come in?

276
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,936
Saw the sign outside.
Any customers?

277
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,604
No, you're the first.

278
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,045
What smells so good?

279
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,982
I'm making an Australian stew.

280
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,984
And what's that?

281
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:19,181
Same as Irish stew,
only the meat's down under.

282
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,520
That's too bad.
We drop by to invite you

283
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,650
and your father out for dinner.

284
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:27,094
Yeah. Out to dinner.
Yeah, dinner.

285
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:30,133
We found a nice little place
down at piccalilli.

286
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,827
French cuisine.

287
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,904
You weren't good
at anything of that kind.

288
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,837
But you're invited to stay and
sample my cooking if you like to.

289
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,603
No. Now, we wouldn't
think of imposing on you.

290
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,770
There's plenty and I insist.

291
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,142
Well, I guess it's better than

292
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,216
looking at the clown
dressing and all that.

293
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,417
Besides, I'm getting awfully
tired of those rich food.

294
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:48,611
We'll stay.

295
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,585
Wonderful.
Make yourself comfortable

296
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:53,486
and I'll get things ready.
Thanks.

297
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,058
By the way, how's Sydney?

298
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,061
Sensational.
He's developed the one-two punch.

299
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,166
And I've got the jaw to proof it.

300
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,234
Yes, the greatest act
ever put under attempt.

301
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,661
There's only one thing wrong.

302
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,065
No one knows about it.

303
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,230
That's where you'll come in.

304
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,132
That's where I come in?

305
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:11,742
We figured that if we could
get enough people down there,

306
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,538
the rest
would take care of itself.

307
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,045
So we thought maybe
if you'd be interested in,

308
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,513
Well, making a little money.

309
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,118
Money? How?

310
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,881
Well, the idea I had in mind
was a swim down the Temps.

311
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,616
Maybe five or six miles
ending up at the carnaval.

312
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,385
We'd follow you
in a row boat, of course.

313
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:32,588
Yeah. If Sydney could swim,
we wouldn't be bothering you.

314
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,925
We'll pay you five pounds

315
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,830
and fifty percent
of the day's proceeds.

316
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:41,937
Well... if you're going to
stage a swim,

317
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,008
why won't you make it a real one?

318
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:45,609
What do you mean?

319
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,042
Well, that six miles
won't impress anybody,

320
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,239
but twenty-six miles might.

321
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:55,179
Twenty-six miles. Holy smoke.
I can't even row that far.

322
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:04,022
I can't understand
what happen to the reporters.

323
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:05,220
I've notified the press.

324
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,794
Maybe they thought
we were crackpots.

325
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:08,922
I wouldn't blame them.

326
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:11,035
Nobody dare think of doing this.

327
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,467
I think we better start.

328
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,566
How do you feel? Cold.

329
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,176
I can't see two feet of me.
Which way do we go?

330
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,503
Just point the boat down river.

331
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,012
Ready, honey?

332
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:28,817
Good luck, honey.
Good luck, Annette.

333
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,946
Well, Sydney, here we come.

334
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,503
Annette, where are you?

335
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,873
Here.

336
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:18,131
Why, me.
There's a girl in the water.

337
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,761
Look out in there.
Under the cloud.

338
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:25,542
Hang on, Miss.
We'll toss you a line.

339
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,942
Never mind there.
Which way is the drainage?

340
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,013
That way.

341
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:32,207
Thank you.

342
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,912
Drainage?

343
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:39,114
Did she say drainage?

344
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:56,668
How do you feel?

345
00:22:56,808 --> 00:23:00,175
I could swim fifty miles
in this current.

346
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:01,844
Save your strength, honey.

347
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,040
You'll be needing
it when we hit the tides.

348
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,021
Great Scott.
What's that girl trying to do?

349
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:18,220
Get off this story.

350
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,456
She'll never get pass
the Tower bridge.

351
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:25,460
Australian girl in marathon swim.

352
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:30,499
Australian girl in marathon swim.

353
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,735
Australian girl...

354
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,743
There she is. Listen.

355
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:39,849
There's Westministers Bridge.

356
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,680
What are all those buildings?

357
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,482
Parliament. And that's Big Ben.

358
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,523
Beautiful sight, isn't it?

359
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:49,183
I can think of a prettier sight.

360
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:51,018
What's that?

361
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,427
Food. I'm starving.

362
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:56,899
We'll leave in half hour.
Keep swimming.

363
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:59,731
Hey, John.
Look at all those people.

364
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,138
Come on, girl.

365
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,671
There she is. Yes. There she is.

366
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,144
Take it on.

367
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:49,549
Good girl. Good girl.

368
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,635
What about that food?

369
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:08,599
Doc? Where's the hamper?

370
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,832
What hamper?

371
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,406
The lunch hamper.

372
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:15,012
The hamper with the food
that you're supposed to bring.

373
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:16,670
Didn't you bring it?

374
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,942
Didn't I bring it.

375
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:22,679
Maybe if we bring it up,
she'll forget the whole thing.

376
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:25,619
Maybe she'll forget
the whole thing.

377
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,918
I can't
keep floating much longer.

378
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,048
Where are we going to
get any grab

379
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,094
in the middle of the Temps River.
I don't know

380
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:34,164
but we've got to think
of something or she'll pass out.

381
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:34,958
There's Tower Point.

382
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,796
Park it there and I'll see
what I can wrestle up.

383
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,811
What's happening? Where is she?

384
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:52,610
She needs to come into the bank.

385
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:55,481
That badly, they gave me this?

386
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,078
Has a pretty nurse gave me this?

387
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,452
Not a bad home?

388
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:03,618
Yeah, but all that food
and nothing to drink.

389
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:05,525
I took care of that, too.

390
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:12,059
Can't you row any faster?

391
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:15,104
What do you think I am,
the Cambridge crew?

392
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:40,726
Lunch. Come and get it.

393
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:50,038
Not exactly a seven course dinner
but it's the best I can do.

394
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,942
They just went for food,
they're hungry.

395
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,640
They'll never make drainage.
There's a strong tide coming.

396
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,943
She'll make it. She'll make it.

397
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,516
She's my daughter, you know.
She's my daughter.

398
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:15,930
Currents turning against her.

399
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:55,437
I hope the old tides moving
in like a wall.

400
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:56,904
I know when we're licked.

401
00:27:57,042 --> 00:28:00,034
Swing along side of it, Doc.
We'll pull her in.

402
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,169
You mean quick?
That's what I said.

403
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:03,974
Anne's gonna kill herself
by five pounds.

404
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:05,309
Maybe if we went...

405
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,645
Doc, I said pull her in.

406
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:15,186
That's enough, honey.
Come on aboard.

407
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:18,987
I'll make it.
Don't be silly.

408
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,497
There's always another time.

409
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:25,501
No. No.

410
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:29,004
You'll kill yourself
fighting this tide.

411
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:33,907
I can't go up now. I just can't.

412
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,447
Hey, Jimmy. What's a...

413
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:46,522
Honey. It's finished.
We're just a mile away.

414
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,853
Do you think
you can hold up, honey.

415
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:53,760
I'll make it. I know I could.

416
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,162
What do you think
of a girl like that.

417
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,005
Daily Express,
can you answer a few questions?

418
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:42,170
Can you hold it for a picture,
Miss Kellerman.

419
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,038
Just for a moment,
just like that. Please.

420
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:45,376
Miss Kellerman is exhausted.

421
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,451
Give her a chance
to catch her breath.

422
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,213
She'll answer all your questions,

423
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:53,218
she'll be over at my office
at the corner.

424
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:56,153
Alright, come on.
Let's follow them.

425
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:12,500
When do you first begin
to get taught, Miss Kellerman?

426
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,202
Did you swim
as far as this in Australia?

427
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:15,911
How long did it
take you to train?

428
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:17,981
Give us a good story,
Miss Kellerman.

429
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:21,415
Please, one at a time.
Which question first.

430
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,111
Tell us about your training,
Miss Kellerman.

431
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:25,119
Do you swim every day, don't you?

432
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:29,386
Well, that all depends.
Oh, gee, gentlemen. I'm so tired.

433
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,893
Kangaroo winning human frame.

434
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:36,729
He win, he boxed, he strikes
when the fought are files.

435
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:39,428
Where's the girl
who made the swim?

436
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:41,732
Over there.

437
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:42,999
How's the house?

438
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:46,167
Fine, but the people
aren't in it. If you ask me,

439
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:49,906
we're selling tickets
for the wrong attraction.

440
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:52,573
Start the show. I'll see if I can
get the press over here.

441
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:54,548
And bring me back some
black coffee, will you?

442
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,278
I'm dead on my feet.

443
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:57,854
Sullivan, you have
to get her out of there.

444
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:00,617
The child's so exhausted
she can barely hold her head up.

445
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:02,817
I'll see what I can do.

446
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:08,727
Yes, I was born in Sydney
and my first...

447
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,164
Alright, gentlemen.
That's it for now.

448
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:12,766
We'll be available
for further interviews tomorrow.

449
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:13,836
Thank you very much.

450
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,099
Good night, Miss Kellerman.
Good night.

451
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:18,732
Let me call your attention
to another visit from Australia.

452
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:19,707
Not as pretty as Miss Kellerman

453
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:22,142
but in his own way,
just as nice...

454
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,977
Look. Aren't you going to
see the kangaroo?

455
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:30,715
Poor Sydney.

456
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:34,484
Looks like you're ready
to put out of business.

457
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:02,417
Sherry?

458
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:46,196
Okay. Okay.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

459
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:47,930
Now you're full of ginger.

460
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:50,227
Last night
you couldn't draw a fly.

461
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:51,835
And we're prepared
to offer Miss Kellerman

462
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,268
eight pounds a week
for such series of swims.

463
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:55,937
Well, she's still asleep
and I doubt every much

464
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:57,268
if she'd be interested.
Alright, though

465
00:32:57,575 --> 00:33:00,601
If there's any change,
you can reach me at Daily Mirror.

466
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,474
Doubt that she'll be interested?

467
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:05,104
What are you, nut?

468
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:06,910
Good morning.

469
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,814
Good morning, Dad.
Good morning.

470
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:10,420
Good morning, Sydney.
You could tell your boss

471
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:15,052
he'd got the most comfortable bed
I ever slept in.

472
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:16,660
You might as well
face it, Professor.

473
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:18,489
Your daughter here
is a celebrated woman.

474
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:21,462
She'd already receive
a dozen offer of employment.

475
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,362
Employment? What kind?
Every kind.

476
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:26,164
Personal appearances,
swimming events, diving exhibits,

477
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,996
the H&R club wants you to go on
the duck shooting season,

478
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,074
the Crystal Palace would like
to know if you could sing,

479
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:32,540
and then there's
the chap here a minute ago,

480
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,575
who's from the Daily Mirror.

481
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:35,110
His paper
wants to sponsor a series

482
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:38,079
of swim at beach resorts
offering eight pounds a week.

483
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:41,674
Well, you didn't let him away,
did you? You accept it?

484
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:43,684
No.

485
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,652
Well, which offer did you accept?

486
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,189
None.
You don't think for a minute.

487
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:49,020
I'll let you fall
for any of these chicken feat.

488
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,787
Eight pounds
to swim around the ocean.

489
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:52,520
What kind of a future
is there to that?

490
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:55,188
Future? Who's thinking about
the future?

491
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,766
I am. Maybe you don't realize it,

492
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,493
but you've struck gold, pay dirt.

493
00:33:58,636 --> 00:33:59,864
Those crowd who came last night,

494
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:02,199
they didn't come to see me,
they come to see you,

495
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:06,504
and I for one, intend to
see that you capitalize on it.

496
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:08,009
What do you propose to do?

497
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:10,910
I propose to stage a show.
Our own show, a water carnival.

498
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,209
A water carnival?
Why not.

499
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:13,142
It's something brand new.

500
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,749
We get a tank
and we charge admission.

501
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,151
Our own private ocean.
I can see it now.

502
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:21,156
People flocking to see the
gorgeous mermaid from Down Under.

503
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:23,817
I see something beautiful,
something graceful, a ballet.

504
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:26,589
That's it.
A water ballet except the music.

505
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,222
Just a moment.

506
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:32,196
All these sounds
highly imaginative,

507
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:35,203
but where would you
stage such an event

508
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,136
and where can you find
a tank big enough

509
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:38,435
for what you describe.

510
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,168
The tank is already built
and waiting for us.

511
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:41,573
Ever hear of
the New York Hippodrome?

512
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:43,407
The Hippodrome?

513
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:46,176
New York?
My dear boy, really.

514
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:47,579
Three thousand miles away.

515
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:49,709
Well, whatever. It's the
biggest tank in the world,

516
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:50,878
the largest theater in the world.

517
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,216
And the longest swim
in the world.

518
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:54,252
Surely,
you must have been joking.

519
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,754
How could we
get to New York City?

520
00:34:56,894 --> 00:35:00,193
Jimmy, it's a
wonderful idea, but...

521
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:03,767
really, Dad and I couldn't pay
a trip to Liverpool, that alone.

522
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:06,597
Who said anything
about you paying for this.

523
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,136
Anybody who travels with Sullivan

524
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,139
travels first class
all expenses paid.

525
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,436
Look, I happen to know the owners
of the Hippodrome personally.

526
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:15,205
Have a concession
when they run a little park.

527
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:18,414
That Sherman would go
for this little idea in a second.

528
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:21,040
But how could you
afford the fares?

529
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:22,652
I thought you were, I mean...

530
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,914
Broke? Perhaps.
But, Mr. Kellerman,

531
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,149
I have such confidence
in this idea

532
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,393
that I'm willing to sacrifice
my entire asset.

533
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:31,757
What asset?

534
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:33,488
Jimmy, no.

535
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,656
Come here, Doc.

536
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,858
Look, I want you
to put Sydney in the wagon.

537
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:37,968
There's a circus coming to town

538
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:39,501
and I'm sure we could get
a good price for him.

539
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:40,604
Sydney?

540
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,228
Go ahead.

541
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,000
Now, Mr. Kellerman, look.

542
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,135
There's a lot of things
I like to discuss with you...

543
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,240
Now, don't take this too hard,
old timer.

544
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:53,611
That's show business.

545
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:56,982
One minute you're up,
the next minute you're...

546
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,013
Mr. Kellerman.

547
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:38,356
No... We said we'll wait for them.
I'll be alright.

548
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:41,659
Take it easy, Pop.
Do you want to sit down?

549
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:44,461
No, no. I'll be alright.

550
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:47,503
You know, this is a
big proposition, real big.

551
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:49,572
Don't you worry about Sullivan.

552
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,198
He could sell
water wings to a duck.

553
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:56,211
I'm becoming aware of that.

554
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:58,212
Here I am,
ten thousand miles from home

555
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:01,041
in a strange city and...

556
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:05,144
completely dependent
upon your persuasive friend.

557
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:10,389
They're liable to be in there
for sometime, Mr. Kellerman.

558
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,190
Come on, we better go home.

559
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,658
Perhaps you're right.

560
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,132
Everybody wants to be
in impresario.

561
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:21,102
Everybody has the world's
greatest idea for the Hippodrome.

562
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,706
Mine's not the greatest,
Mr. Harper,

563
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,070
but it's a colorful
and exploitable package.

564
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:27,803
It's good. It's one of
the best that I've ever heard.

565
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:29,435
My compliment
on your showmanship,

566
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,775
but I can't use it.

567
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,713
You can't use it? But...

568
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:36,547
I simply can't risk it
on an unknown.

569
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:40,851
Unknown?
Take a look at this clippings.

570
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:45,588
They're impressive.

571
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,028
They're very impressive
but they happened in London.

572
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:51,191
In New York,
the story was just a swift.

573
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:54,232
I can't build the whole show
around the swimmer.

574
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,499
Annette isn't just
a swimmer, Mr. Harper.

575
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:59,667
She's got something very unusual.

576
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:00,640
I'm sure she has.

577
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,871
Mr. Harper, I know that
this water carnival idea

578
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:05,312
is tailor-made
for a place like hippodrome.

579
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:06,781
Let me put it this way.

580
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:09,681
Right now, the policy of
the Hippodrome costs applaud

581
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,050
and spectacles with story.

582
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:13,816
These are tanks
for the big climax.

583
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,189
For me to stage a water ballet
without even a book,

584
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:20,020
well, I mean, I like it, but...

585
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,797
Hello. What's it? No. No.

586
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:28,996
We have all
the confederate uniforms we want.

587
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,472
I might be
needing some show girls.

588
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:33,099
Can you do anything besides swim?

589
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:34,575
Well, I can dance.

590
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:37,738
Well, if you're interested,
come back Monday.

591
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:39,509
It's the best I can do.
I'm sorry.

592
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,207
But, Mr. Harper...
By the way,

593
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:43,419
can you find me a Lincoln
that looks like Lincoln?

594
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:44,714
Well, all those characters
you have dug out

595
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:46,789
look more like
the Smith brothers.

596
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:49,449
Yes, I know. Now look.
I've told you what I wanted.

597
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:50,924
This man must be...

598
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:53,189
If you can't do it,
I'll get somebody else.

599
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,829
You know what I want...

600
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:05,598
Well, that's that.

601
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:08,405
It isn't your fault, Jimmy.

602
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:12,073
It's a good idea and I run into
it with my eyes open.

603
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,923
Well, anyway, you can go work
with Harper if you want to.

604
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:24,619
Might not be a bad idea.

605
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,161
I don't know
what I'm going to do.

606
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,197
Probably run up to Boston.

607
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:31,059
Find my own concession
at the Beetbeach.

608
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,796
He wants me
to help in ballethood.

609
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:36,839
Jimmy, I have to make some money.

610
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:39,568
It's Dad I'm thinking about.

611
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:43,908
You see, music is his whole life,
loving it, teaching it,

612
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,881
having his own conservatory.

613
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:49,850
If only I could give
it to him that much.

614
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:51,648
You can.

615
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:54,553
How?

616
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:57,092
Forget it. I'm not going
to sell you something else

617
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,718
that haven't fizzle out.

618
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:01,661
Take the Harper job.
It's safe on expenses.

619
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:05,860
No. I need more
than just expenses.

620
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:09,404
Jimmy, how much can you
make out of a concession?

621
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:11,702
If it clicks, plenty.
All we have to do is pool

622
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:13,537
enough money together
to buy a little tank

623
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:16,145
and then we... Look,
I told you to forget it.

624
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,212
It's too much of a long shot.

625
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:19,213
I've only got six dollars
in my pocket.

626
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:22,217
Well, I still have
three silver cups left

627
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:25,220
and then that would be enough
to get us to Boston, isn't it?

628
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:28,185
Maybe.
Well, I was just thinking.

629
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:30,589
In London, we swam down
the Temps to get publicity

630
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:32,252
and that work pretty well,
didn't it?

631
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,053
Keep talking.

632
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:35,756
Suppose we did
the same thing here.

633
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,232
I'll marathon swim
from somewhere, anywhere.

634
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:40,060
Not anywhere, from Revere Beach.

635
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:42,695
Oh, baby, I knew we were a team
from the first time I saw you.

636
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,205
We'll stand that town on its ear.

637
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:46,571
I'll get enough backing
for ten tanks not just one.

638
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,699
Jimmy. Do you think so?

639
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:49,779
Think so? Who's going to stop us?

640
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:14,700
Just be patient. He'll be along
in a couple of minutes.

641
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:17,433
Where is she
going to swim to, mister?

642
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:20,100
To that lighthouse,
way up there, in fact.

643
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:23,077
Gee, that must be fifty miles.

644
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:23,976
Twenty miles.

645
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:25,672
What did you get there
in the basket, mister?

646
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,681
Take your hands off that hamper.

647
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,046
Come on, get out of here.

648
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:32,087
Go on.
Beat it, you little monster.

649
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:45,167
I don't believe it.

650
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:47,964
Did you see that?
Her legs are bare.

651
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:57,637
She ought to be arrested.

652
00:41:58,616 --> 00:41:59,981
Who is she?

653
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:01,948
Look at her...

654
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:09,052
What is it? Who?

655
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,717
I don't believe it.

656
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,361
That's her.

657
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:15,489
Let's not bother her.

658
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:18,659
They'll be cheering
when she finish her swim.

659
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:20,167
Shocking.

660
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:22,636
On a public beach.

661
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:25,241
Wait up. Wait up.

662
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:29,174
The row boat is all ready.

663
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:32,739
Colder out here
than it is in the water.

664
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,475
Well, honey. This is it.

665
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:38,486
Good luck, Annette.
Thanks, Doc. I'll need it.

666
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:51,900
Don't worry about anything.
Just start to swim.

667
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:56,200
It's disgraceful.
Arrest that woman.

668
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,900
Hold. Just a minute.
Just a minute.

669
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:00,533
Just a minute, miss.

670
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:01,975
What do you think you're doing?

671
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:03,170
Officer,
this is Annette Kellerman,

672
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,970
the famous Australian swimmer.

673
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:07,174
She's about the embark
on a twenty miles swim.

674
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:08,546
Not in that outfit.

675
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:13,919
What? You don't expect me to go
20 miles on those things, do you?

676
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:18,222
All I expect you to do, miss,
is cover yourself up.

677
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:19,461
Come on, Jimmy.
Let's get out of here.

678
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,064
Not on your life.
You've done nothing wrong

679
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:23,792
and I won't
let anyone intimidate you.

680
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,630
Just a minute. Just a moment.

681
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,616
Indecent exposure.
Held for trial.

682
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:42,776
All those hypocrites,

683
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,616
sanctimonious
who knows, hypocrites.

684
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:47,553
How dare they.

685
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:50,751
Dad. Where are we going?
Now, now.

686
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:52,691
The lobby's full of
reporters and cameramen,

687
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,263
and they like to know
if they can come up.

688
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:57,094
Well, you just tell them
to go away.

689
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:58,132
Tell them I've left town.

690
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:02,204
I never want to see Boston again.
I'll just go some place else.

691
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:05,206
Wrong. You'll swim here.
As far as I'm concern,

692
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:07,333
this is the greatest thing
that has ever happened.

693
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:10,572
The greatest...
I'm booked and fingerprinted

694
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:13,444
and arrested just like a con...
What others.

695
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:14,949
Don't you realize
you're the standard bearer

696
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:16,518
of all American womanhood?

697
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,643
In your hands lies the power

698
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:19,346
the wreck
the shutter of puritanry.

699
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:21,583
Free the feminine sex
and the aura of convention.

700
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:23,192
Go ahead, run away if you want.

701
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,919
But I tell you,
this is more than a trial,

702
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:26,359
more than a newspaper headline.

703
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:27,521
This is a crusade.

704
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,064
Bravo.

705
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:32,668
I said bravo.

706
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:37,069
This tempest over a bathing suit,
it's... it's really evil.

707
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:38,174
It should be
exposed to the world.

708
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:39,601
Well, I for one,
intends to see that

709
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:42,211
my daughter stays
and fights this thing through.

710
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,211
Here. Here. That a boy, Pop.

711
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:47,712
It's high time the American women
show what they have in skin.

712
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:48,510
It's up to you, darling.

713
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:50,517
You can pay the fine
and leave Boston tonight

714
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:54,021
or you can stay and accept
the challenge.

715
00:44:55,225 --> 00:45:00,060
Indecent.
Tell those reporters to come up.

716
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:04,133
I'll give them a story,
bathing suit and all.

717
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:32,958
And as prosecutor
for this county,

718
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:35,361
I demand
the severest possible penalty

719
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:37,195
for this brazen young woman

720
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:40,895
who has wantonly flaunted
every statute of decency.

721
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:42,630
She and the others like her
must learn that

722
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:45,207
laws are made to be observed.

723
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:47,207
Her guilt is uncontestable.

724
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:50,177
She admits that she wore
the indecent garment in question.

725
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:53,177
I admit no such thing.
What's that?

726
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:54,875
You deny that
you appear at Revere Beach

727
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:58,044
in a flimsy material
that barely covered...

728
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:00,748
I admit
I wore a one-piece bathing suit.

729
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:02,791
I do not admit that
it was indecent.

730
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,188
Whatever definition you apply,

731
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:06,759
your arms,
neck and shoulder were exposed,

732
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:08,956
not to mention
your limps and thighs.

733
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,363
My ankle were also exposed,

734
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:14,164
not to mention my toes,
knees and fingers.

735
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:16,132
I also notice your teeth
are exposed.

736
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,465
Does that make you indecent?

737
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,201
Your honor. Your honor,
if you please.

738
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:21,208
This woman has deliberately

739
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:23,480
trying to make
a mockery of this court.

740
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,911
I wouldn't be surprise
if those pickets

741
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:28,575
are outside at her instigation.
This frequent disrespect...

742
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,380
I object, your honor.

743
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:33,388
Are you the attorney
for the defendant?

744
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:34,354
No.

745
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:37,689
Then keep your seat
or I shall have to eject you.

746
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:42,195
Miss Kellerman,
it's not the intention

747
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:44,399
of this court to take side in

748
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:47,402
what is essentially
feminine thing.

749
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:52,635
You're charged
with indecent exposure

750
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:54,573
to which you pleaded...

751
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:56,076
Not guilty, sir.

752
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:58,374
Your honor, her appearance
at the beach was witnessed

753
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,178
by hundreds of people,
including a police officer.

754
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,479
I am aware of that.

755
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:06,316
Have you anything further to add,
Miss Kellerman?

756
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:08,618
Yes, your honor, I have.

757
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:11,489
You see, I have been in
swimming competition all my life,

758
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:14,028
and the only way I've been
able to compete successfully

759
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:17,861
is by wearing a man's
one-piece racing suit.

760
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:21,960
After all, sir, you can't deny me
my right to swim, can you?

761
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:23,367
Certainly not.

762
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:26,340
Well then, how is it possible
to swim a race

763
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:30,880
tied up in a corset
and ten yards away of drapery?

764
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,651
Mr. Kelleman,
let me remind you that

765
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:40,052
it is not I who was on trial.

766
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:43,057
I'm sorry, your honor.

767
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:46,094
May I please ask
the court one more question?

768
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,663
Proceed.

769
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:52,360
Well, do the authority object
to the one piece bathing suit

770
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:55,165
or that the fact the limps
are not entirely covered?

771
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:57,603
I see no reason
to base any decision

772
00:47:57,741 --> 00:48:01,609
on the number of piece
on article of clothings.

773
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:04,145
Well, perhaps
I could suggest a compromise.

774
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:05,312
Proceed.

775
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:10,614
Thank you.
This is the original racing suit,

776
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:14,155
except that I have sewn
some stockings at the bottom

777
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:16,517
and jersey on the top.

778
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:17,183
As you can see,

779
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:19,325
this will cover
the entire body except

780
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:21,192
the forearms and the head.

781
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:23,424
I consider that shocking,
your honor.

782
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,536
I consider it very ingenious.

783
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,160
Is it my understanding
that any further

784
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:33,136
swimming appearances will be made
in a bathing suit of that nature?

785
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:35,468
Yes, your honor.

786
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:39,038
Case dismiss.

787
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:07,336
Hurry... Step right up.

788
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,537
The show is next five minutes.

789
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,477
Alright, folks, step right up.

790
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,584
See Annette Kellerman
in a one-piece swimming suit.

791
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:16,686
Annette show in five minutes.

792
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:19,380
Step right up, friend. How many?
Thank you, sir.

793
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:22,686
Annette show in five minutes.
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

794
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:25,920
See Annette Kellerman
in a one-piece swimming suit.

795
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:29,157
Hurry. Hurry...

796
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:32,029
Ladies and gentlemen,

797
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:35,161
introducing Australia's mermaid

798
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,201
Annette Kellerman,

799
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:39,634
voted by Harvard University

800
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:42,438
as the World's
most perfect woman.

801
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:45,878
World's champion swimmer,
holder of records

802
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:48,712
from one hundredyards
to twenty-six miles.

803
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:50,649
Miss Annette Kellerman.

804
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:57,216
Miss Kellerman
will now demonstrate

805
00:49:57,527 --> 00:49:59,893
the various swimming strokes.

806
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:12,498
The breast stroke.

807
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:25,244
The over arm stroke.

808
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:40,993
For the first time in America,
the Trojan stroke.

809
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:42,469
This stroke was made
by Miss Kellerman

810
00:50:42,606 --> 00:50:44,164
when she attempt
the sensational swim

811
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:46,639
at Tempe River
in London, England.

812
00:50:57,487 --> 00:50:59,819
And now
for the first time in America,

813
00:50:59,956 --> 00:51:04,757
Miss Kellerman introduces
her famous Australian crawl.

814
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:31,953
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
for the first time in the U.S.A.,

815
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:35,820
a woman will give her public
exhibition of fancy high diving.

816
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:40,089
Miss Kellerman will now
demonstrate the front high dive.

817
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:11,153
Step right up, folks.
The show is now going on.

818
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:15,090
The Annette Kellerman
and her one-piece bathing suit.

819
00:52:15,232 --> 00:52:18,599
Step right up.
Atta boy, talk it up.

820
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:20,999
Six weeks, Doc. Make it seven.

821
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:27,242
Every show a different color.

822
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:21,092
Jimmy.

823
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:23,096
Jimmy, I'm soaking wet.

824
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:26,600
Good. Maybe that'll
put the fire on.

825
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:41,083
Go. Go.

826
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:54,222
Think it over, Sullivan.

827
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:56,229
I'm leaving for Florida tonight.

828
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:57,526
I could use a guy like you.

829
00:53:57,667 --> 00:53:59,726
If it's the other way, boy,
I might be interested.

830
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:00,858
Which way?

831
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:03,666
Maybe I could use a guy like you.

832
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:13,844
You know, sometimes
I wish we had Sydney back.

833
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:14,678
We didn't have that much money,

834
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:18,887
but I don't have this...
this bookkeeping.

835
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:21,490
And what's this item here,
personal, two hundred dollars.

836
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:24,651
It's this personal matter.

837
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:29,324
No kidding. Did you ask her yet?

838
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,494
Today's the day.
Season's closing real soon...

839
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:36,629
And you want somebody to keep
your feet warm every night.

840
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,931
Great, but what about me?

841
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:41,043
Doc, I've got an idea
for something brand new.

842
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:43,668
A great idea.
A swimmer and a flyer.

843
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:45,041
A flyer.

844
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:47,308
That's what we'll do.
The acts will be dynamite.

845
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,940
You know, he can actually
take that contraption

846
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:50,712
four hundred feet off the ground?

847
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:53,015
I don't like it.
It's against nature.

848
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:54,248
You and your grousing.

849
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:58,191
Can't you see that new poster,
Sullivan's combined shows.

850
00:54:58,328 --> 00:55:00,193
King of the air,
Queen of the sea.

851
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:01,592
Don't get me wrong now.

852
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:03,221
That will still be
our number one attraction.

853
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:05,266
We can dream, can't we?

854
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:08,030
There she is, dreamer.

855
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,535
Hi, there. Hello, Jimmy.

856
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:16,839
I'm not late, am I?

857
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:19,005
Performance starts at two thirty.

858
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,617
Jimmy. This is Mr. Aldrich,
of the Aldrich Selection Bureau.

859
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:23,886
He was kind enough
to drive me back from lunch.

860
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,578
My pleasure.
How do you do?

861
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:27,121
I have a special
interest in Miss Kellerman.

862
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:30,192
I'm trying to persuade her
to go on a tour.

863
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:31,294
What kind of tour?

864
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:32,918
He offered me
a great deal of money

865
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:35,691
and ten weeks guarantee,
just to do a series of lectures.

866
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:40,163
Yes, indeed. I see Miss Kellerman
in a very dignified presentation

867
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:42,863
giving a lecture
on the body beautiful.

868
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:46,100
Perhaps a little ballet
on the subject.

869
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:50,338
Ballet? Lecture? No.

870
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,947
What's so funny?

871
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:54,414
Darling. I'm sorry that
one of us must be nutty.

872
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:56,712
You competing
with William Jennings Brown.

873
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,252
I can see you now
up on the platform

874
00:55:58,388 --> 00:55:59,616
with a picture
of water and ballet

875
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:01,587
dancing around some grass drapes.

876
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:03,017
Holy smoke.

877
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:04,387
I'm happy
to be contributing so much

878
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,518
to your amusement, Mr. Sullivan.

879
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:08,858
But I assure you my end
is a very dignified

880
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:10,625
and lucrative business.

881
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:14,301
Miss Kellerman will not be
swimming around tank like a seal,

882
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:17,600
performing in a carnival
like a fat lady on one side

883
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:20,266
and a fire-eater on the other.

884
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:22,002
You don't like carnivals?

885
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:23,373
They have their place.

886
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:26,038
And you don't like swimming
around tanks either.

887
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:27,809
For a fish, yes.

888
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:30,511
For a beautiful woman
like Miss kellerman...

889
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:33,144
Mr. Aldrich,
I think it's about time

890
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:35,849
that you learn to enjoy water.

891
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:39,360
Jimmy, stop that.

892
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:42,192
Jimmy, Let go of him. Let go.
Alright. Run along, sonny,

893
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:43,629
and take your grass
sticks with you.

894
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:47,328
Jimmy, how dare you.
Mr. Aldrich, I'm terribly sorry.

895
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:48,596
Go over there and sit down.

896
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,069
Annette, put over your suit.

897
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:52,401
The show starts
in twenty minutes.

898
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:27,870
Yes?

899
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,214
Jimmy.

900
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:38,912
Annette, I'm sorry.
This big temper of mine.

901
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:41,114
I guess I'll never
be able to control it.

902
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:46,559
Darling. We shouldn't
quarrel, not about this.

903
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:49,290
It's just not important enough.

904
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:51,161
I don't get you.

905
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:54,327
We came up here purely
and simply for money.

906
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:58,407
Anything that offers us
more money is more important.

907
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:00,907
Still got old Aldrich
on your mind, have you?

908
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:03,979
Darling,
it's five hundred dollars a week.

909
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:09,107
Puts me just that much closer
to Kallerman conversatory.

910
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:12,085
It isn't as though
we're splitting up.

911
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:13,883
I'll talk to Aldrich.

912
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:16,583
I'm sure there'll
be important job for you.

913
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:18,250
Like filling the water pitchers.

914
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:20,589
Jimmy.
Or picking up the drapes.

915
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,630
Or maybe I can come ahead of you
and give short talk

916
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:24,892
on high class we are.

917
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:27,594
Maybe somewhere along the line,
we get our signals crossed.

918
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:29,929
You got into your head
that you want to work.

919
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:31,335
Well, get it out fast.

920
00:58:31,474 --> 00:58:33,066
You're a swimmer
doing a tank act

921
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:35,677
in Sullivan's water carnival,
and not a bad show either.

922
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:38,413
And how long can it last?

923
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:40,675
After all, what we're doing
is capitalizing

924
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:43,285
on a lot of
cheap bathing suit publicity.

925
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:46,252
What do you think
this Aldrich thing is anyway?

926
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:48,448
All he's trying to do is cash
in on the same dodge

927
00:58:48,591 --> 00:58:51,185
and ballyhoo that
I've been arranged.

928
00:58:53,496 --> 00:58:54,554
That you arranged?

929
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:57,291
Sure. What did you think
I let that cop to arrest you?

930
00:58:57,433 --> 00:58:59,196
No, Jimmy, you didn't.

931
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:01,565
Didn't I?

932
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:04,002
Can you stand there...

933
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,335
what about all that talk about
a crusade and...

934
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:09,240
Bunk. Who cares what
a lot of females wear on a beach,

935
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,847
as long as I can keep you
in a one-piece bathing suit.

936
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:13,539
Baby, you're a swimmer.

937
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:15,048
You belong in the water.

938
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:16,481
Wet, you're terrific.

939
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:18,348
Dry, you're just a nice girl
who ought to settle down

940
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:21,013
and get married.

941
00:59:21,157 --> 00:59:23,921
Thank you very much
for the advice.

942
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:28,326
One thing I know for sure,
if and when I do get married,

943
00:59:28,464 --> 00:59:31,262
it will never be the work
of a cheap, stubborn,

944
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:34,268
flea circus proprietor.

945
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:37,100
This flea circus does alright
for the fleas in it,

946
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,607
except when they jumped
out of their cages.

947
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:46,907
Ballet. Comics wanting
to play hamlet. Toe dancing.

948
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:49,610
She has that bug in her head
ever since we first met.

949
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,181
Well, Miss Kellerman
may be able to swim,

950
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:53,084
but she'll never fly.

951
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:55,918
What are you talking about?

952
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:58,584
Jimmy, no.
Look at these receipts,

953
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:02,562
look at these books. Here, look,
nothing but money, money, money.

954
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:05,065
Plenty where all those came from.

955
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:06,828
I'd be a sucker to go ahead
and think big plans

956
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,494
depends on the whim of a girl

957
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:10,299
with bloody notions
about herself.

958
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,704
Hey, look, pal.
You ain't serious, right.

959
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:15,569
You're kidding, Jimmy.
Tell me you're kidding.

960
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:17,942
I'll be back in a few minutes.

961
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:20,276
Flea circus.

962
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:23,351
Flea circus, she calls us.

963
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:31,655
And then, my dear,
you will come out

964
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:34,156
in a tasteful evening gown

965
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:38,563
against the background of perhaps
a small salon of orchestra.

966
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:39,690
Your talk will be prepared,

967
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:42,130
of course, subject
to your approval.

968
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:44,671
And as for the dances...

969
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:48,743
Mr. Aldrich,
I'm terribly sorry but I, well...

970
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:52,871
I just can't see myself
doing all those sort of thing.

971
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:55,177
My dear child,
it's natural to be nervous,

972
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,616
and I understand.
But you'll only...

973
01:00:57,754 --> 01:01:01,417
Please. I have a headache.

974
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:04,025
Perhaps we can talk about
it some other time.

975
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,650
But I have to make preparations.

976
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:10,661
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
you better hold up for a while.

977
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,893
Good night, Miss Kellerman.

978
01:01:13,036 --> 01:01:15,231
Good night, Mr. Aldrich.

979
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,444
Good evening.

980
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:29,509
Annette, read this.

981
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:32,621
It's from
the New York Hippodrome.

982
01:01:32,755 --> 01:01:36,953
New Hippodrome policy
will feature great specialty.

983
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:42,690
Can you come to New York
to discuss deal. Alfred Harper.

984
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:44,732
Dad, the New York Hippodrome.

985
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:48,731
Yes.
But this is just Jimmy...

986
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:56,978
What is it, my dear?

987
01:01:57,113 --> 01:01:59,604
Dad.

988
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:03,048
So that's it.

989
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:06,479
You better let him read it, too.

990
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:10,991
There's nothing like good news
to patch up a lover's quarrel.

991
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:14,522
Come on, off you go.

992
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:43,983
Miss Kelleman.

993
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:46,689
Hello, Andy.

994
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:48,088
What are you doing here?

995
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:51,723
I thought you're on your way
to florida with Mr. Sullivan.

996
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:53,899
Florida?

997
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:57,939
That's what he said.
You mean you didn't know?

998
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:02,505
Yes, of course, Andy.

999
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:05,637
How stupid of me.

1000
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:08,143
Thank you, Andy.

1001
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:19,891
Bravo...

1002
01:08:29,805 --> 01:08:32,000
Madam Pavlova. Yes.

1003
01:08:32,141 --> 01:08:35,042
I'm Annette Kellerman.
Indeed, I know, my dear.

1004
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:37,509
I have watched you perform.

1005
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:41,082
Well, I want to tell you is that,

1006
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:42,411
well, all my life,

1007
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:44,678
I've been wanting to
be able to dance like you.

1008
01:08:44,987 --> 01:08:47,547
You studied for the ballet?

1009
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:49,282
Yes.

1010
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:53,452
My dear, don't thought that
your studies have been in vain.

1011
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:55,655
Your act is wonderful.

1012
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,390
You have applied
your ballet training

1013
01:08:57,533 --> 01:09:00,969
to something new and different.

1014
01:09:01,103 --> 01:09:04,095
They tell me
there is only one Pavlova,

1015
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,140
but from what I've seen, someday,

1016
01:09:06,275 --> 01:09:08,539
they'll say
the same thing about you.

1017
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:12,010
There is only one
Annette Kellerman.

1018
01:09:21,957 --> 01:09:24,425
I wish she hasn't told you that.

1019
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:25,652
Alfred.

1020
01:09:25,961 --> 01:09:28,327
Here I am with next season's
contract still unsigned

1021
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:32,628
and people like Pavlova
may start puffing you up.

1022
01:09:32,768 --> 01:09:35,965
No. I'll always work for
the Hippodrome for nothing.

1023
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:37,402
There's no need
for that, Annette.

1024
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:38,905
You really have been great

1025
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:42,169
and this is the best way
I know of saying.

1026
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:47,482
Alfred.
Don't thank me.

1027
01:09:47,616 --> 01:09:50,016
Thank all the people
who came here to see you.

1028
01:09:50,152 --> 01:09:52,086
Annette, I'm giving
a little supper for Pavlova

1029
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:54,086
Saturday night
after the performance.

1030
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:56,487
Can you come?

1031
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:58,650
May I let you know?

1032
01:09:58,794 --> 01:10:00,022
I don't get it.

1033
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:03,461
Are you in mourning
or are you just a hermit.

1034
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:04,566
Mr. Kellerman,

1035
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,567
I'm trying to persuade
your daughter to come to a party

1036
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:09,295
and seems I can't...
Of course, she'll go.

1037
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:10,405
It'll do you good, darling.

1038
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:12,006
You'd been seeing
too little of New York

1039
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:14,302
and too much of my musicians.

1040
01:10:14,443 --> 01:10:17,037
And besides, orders are orders.

1041
01:10:17,179 --> 01:10:19,204
Mr. Harper is my new boss.

1042
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:21,043
Boss?
I'd been asked to work

1043
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:23,651
in the Hippodrome Orchestra
for the next season.

1044
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:26,080
Dad. Let's hope
it's only the beginning, sir.

1045
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:27,655
The Hippodrome needs
your kind of talent.

1046
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:29,417
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1047
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,150
Got to make the Kellermans happy.

1048
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:33,090
The man at my box office
told me so.

1049
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:34,389
I'll see you later.

1050
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:36,691
Bye, Alfred.

1051
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:40,264
Dad, I think it's just
so exciting and wonderful.

1052
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:43,337
The two of us
here working together.

1053
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:45,963
I couldn't be happier.

1054
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:50,601
Couldn't you?
I've got the report.

1055
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:54,443
He went to Florida
with that flying act

1056
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:58,713
and William sliced up
the second day.

1057
01:10:58,854 --> 01:10:59,718
And where is he now?

1058
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:01,516
Well, this report said
he was in New Orleans

1059
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:03,215
for a while
with a wrestling bear,

1060
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:10,288
then up in Chicago with some kind
of concession that closed.

1061
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:13,697
Dad, I've just got to find him.

1062
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:17,336
That argument with him
was so stupid and silly.

1063
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:21,068
This whole thing, the Hippodrome,
it was Jimmy's idea.

1064
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:24,611
Darling, you mustn't
confuse love and loyalty.

1065
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:27,147
You owe nothing to anybody
in the world.

1066
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:28,682
Not to me or anybody.

1067
01:11:28,817 --> 01:11:31,342
Jimmy knows that, too.

1068
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:33,955
Does he?
Deep in his heart he does.

1069
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:36,421
I'm sure that's the reason
for his absence.

1070
01:11:36,558 --> 01:11:39,118
He wants to make good
without Annette Kellerman,

1071
01:11:39,261 --> 01:11:42,128
if you should don't need him.

1072
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:44,664
Dad, I do need him. I'm...

1073
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:48,528
I know but that's
the way Sullivan is.

1074
01:11:48,671 --> 01:11:51,105
And he's no different
from most of us.

1075
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:55,404
Darling, that's the price
a woman pays for achievement.

1076
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:59,173
It'll come to you something
you've offered but not before.

1077
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,340
It's a long gamble, I'll admit.

1078
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:04,543
A thousand and one shot
that may never come off.

1079
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:07,053
The only thing
you could be sure of

1080
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:09,885
is that he'll be trying.

1081
01:15:45,574 --> 01:15:48,202
Hello, Martley.

1082
01:15:51,013 --> 01:15:52,344
Annette.

1083
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:54,711
Harper, what is it?

1084
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:58,081
What's the matter?

1085
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:02,856
Dad.

1086
01:16:14,102 --> 01:16:18,004
Poor old guy. He was okay.

1087
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:23,507
He never did
get his conservatory.

1088
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:25,044
Wish he had.

1089
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:28,445
Aren't you gonna see her?

1090
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:31,316
Nope.

1091
01:16:31,453 --> 01:16:34,251
Hey, Jimmy.

1092
01:16:34,389 --> 01:16:35,651
Look pal. You and me,

1093
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:38,988
we've been around together
for a long time.

1094
01:16:39,127 --> 01:16:41,561
Sometime I croused, I admit it.

1095
01:16:41,697 --> 01:16:44,689
You know,
I'd give my right arm for you.

1096
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:45,891
What are you getting at?

1097
01:16:46,034 --> 01:16:48,002
Well, you ain't really serious

1098
01:16:48,136 --> 01:16:50,104
about going ahead
with this scheme, are you?

1099
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:51,671
You bet your life I am.

1100
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:53,274
I'm going to
get this plane off the ground

1101
01:16:53,408 --> 01:16:55,308
and we're going to hit pay dirt.

1102
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:58,413
I hope that's all we hit.

1103
01:17:02,084 --> 01:17:06,646
The arial sensational.
Read about it.

1104
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:10,917
Read about it.
Cross country air race.

1105
01:17:11,059 --> 01:17:14,620
Thirty thousand dollars
in prizes. Read about it.

1106
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:16,989
Good evening, Mr. Harper.
Good evening, Miss Kellerman.

1107
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:18,190
Good evening.

1108
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:20,597
Did you hear about
the cross country air race?

1109
01:17:20,736 --> 01:17:23,933
The thirty thousand dollars
in cash prize?

1110
01:17:24,072 --> 01:17:25,369
Well, that's alright.
No, no. Take it.

1111
01:17:25,507 --> 01:17:27,600
Thank you.

1112
01:17:27,743 --> 01:17:30,940
Crazy fools,
they'll all be killed.

1113
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:33,912
That's mad, but what is done.

1114
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:41,579
Good evening, Rachel.
Hello, Mac.

1115
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:43,657
Well, Doc.

1116
01:17:43,959 --> 01:17:47,690
Hello, Annette.
Can I talk to you a second?

1117
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:49,463
Excuse me, Alfred.

1118
01:17:49,598 --> 01:17:52,624
This is an old friend of mine,
Doc Cronnol. Mr. Harper.

1119
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:54,326
How are you?
Glad to meet you.

1120
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:57,700
I'll see you later, dear.
Fine. Fine.

1121
01:17:57,839 --> 01:18:00,831
Come on. Come on in
and tell me all about yourself.

1122
01:18:00,976 --> 01:18:02,204
I...
How have you been?

1123
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:05,939
Fine. Fine.
How's Jimmy?

1124
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:09,642
That's why I'm here.
I hate to bother you, Annette,

1125
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:12,317
but somebody got to
talk him out of that thing.

1126
01:18:12,454 --> 01:18:15,082
What thing?
That Buckaus air race.

1127
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:18,283
He's got his eyes on that fifty
thousand dollars pot, you know.

1128
01:18:18,427 --> 01:18:20,895
Doc. Jimmy?

1129
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:24,430
You mean
he's gonna fly to California?

1130
01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:26,966
He's gonna try.
You should see and watch.

1131
01:18:27,102 --> 01:18:29,093
You can't even steer that thing.

1132
01:18:29,237 --> 01:18:33,003
You can swing around
with ropes over your shoulders.

1133
01:18:33,141 --> 01:18:35,336
Doc. He'll
smash himself to pieces.

1134
01:18:35,477 --> 01:18:36,944
Well, I've been
trying to tell him

1135
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:39,138
but you know that Sullivan.

1136
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:41,545
I just thought
maybe there was something

1137
01:18:41,683 --> 01:18:43,651
you could figure out.

1138
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:45,510
When did he plan to take off?

1139
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:49,090
Any time now, maybe even tomorrow
if the weather's right.

1140
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:50,384
We've been sleeping
next to the machine,

1141
01:18:50,525 --> 01:18:52,652
out of Montac point.

1142
01:18:52,794 --> 01:18:55,592
Doc. I've got
a performance tonight.

1143
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:57,198
Don't you worry, I'll be there.

1144
01:18:57,332 --> 01:18:58,959
I'll figure out something.

1145
01:18:59,101 --> 01:19:00,591
Gee, thanks, Annette.

1146
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:02,363
Bye-bye, Doc.

1147
01:19:04,206 --> 01:19:08,074
Don't tell him I came here.
I 'm enough trouble now.

1148
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:10,144
Sure. Sure, Doc. Bye.

1149
01:19:10,278 --> 01:19:12,075
Bye.

1150
01:23:57,465 --> 01:23:59,433
Well, it looks like it's lifting.

1151
01:23:59,567 --> 01:24:04,095
Okay, Mac. Clear the field.
We're gonna take off.

1152
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:07,333
Jim, don't you think
we ought to wait a little while.

1153
01:24:07,475 --> 01:24:08,942
It might rain.

1154
01:24:09,077 --> 01:24:11,272
The weather is perfect.

1155
01:24:28,797 --> 01:24:30,662
Please, I'm sorry.
Excuse me, please.

1156
01:24:30,965 --> 01:24:32,660
Nobody gets through, miss.
He's gonna take off.

1157
01:24:32,967 --> 01:24:35,492
But officer, I...
I'm sorry.

1158
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:43,438
Nobody gets through.
Stand back.

1159
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:45,011
Thank you.
Keep going, Sullivan.

1160
01:24:45,146 --> 01:24:47,671
Bring me an orange
from California, Jimmy.

1161
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,114
Good luck, Jim.
I'll need it.

1162
01:24:53,254 --> 01:24:55,347
Best of luck, Jim.
Thank you.

1163
01:24:56,491 --> 01:24:59,324
Jimmy.

1164
01:24:59,461 --> 01:25:01,588
Hello, sweetest.
How's everything?

1165
01:25:01,896 --> 01:25:03,261
I heard you're at the Hippodrome.

1166
01:25:03,398 --> 01:25:05,923
She has no pass, Mr. Sullivan.
Shall I let her stay?

1167
01:25:06,067 --> 01:25:07,364
Sure, why not.

1168
01:25:07,502 --> 01:25:09,595
She's a famous personality
in that Coleman.

1169
01:25:09,904 --> 01:25:12,031
Why won't let you?

1170
01:25:12,173 --> 01:25:14,505
Jimmy Sullivan,
I don't care what happen to you,

1171
01:25:14,642 --> 01:25:16,940
but Doc is a friend of mine

1172
01:25:17,078 --> 01:25:19,239
and I forbid you
to take him on this flight.

1173
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:21,678
See what I mean?
Greatest lecture of the day.

1174
01:25:21,983 --> 01:25:23,280
You heard me.

1175
01:25:23,418 --> 01:25:26,410
I'm not going to let them find
Doc's broken body

1176
01:25:26,554 --> 01:25:28,545
crushed and mangled in some where
in the Rocky Mountain.

1177
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:29,987
That's very sweet of you, baby,

1178
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:31,183
but you don't have
to worry about Doc.

1179
01:25:31,326 --> 01:25:32,657
He's not leaving the ground.

1180
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:34,557
He's driving
hat emergency repair car.

1181
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:37,859
That's me,
still looking as I am a robot.

1182
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:40,264
All clear, Mr. Sullivan.
Right.

1183
01:25:41,469 --> 01:25:46,099
Jimmy, please don't force me
to take drastic actions.

1184
01:25:46,241 --> 01:25:47,333
What's that?

1185
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:51,206
I said don't force me
to take drastic action.

1186
01:25:51,346 --> 01:25:56,682
I've never forced you
to do anything, baby, remember?

1187
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:59,954
Okay, Doc. Let's go.

1188
01:26:00,922 --> 01:26:02,617
Here's a summons, Mr. Sullivan.

1189
01:26:02,757 --> 01:26:04,657
Your flying machine and
all equipment has been attached.

1190
01:26:04,959 --> 01:26:07,018
What? Go away.
Sorry. It's a court order.

1191
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:08,026
Court order for what?

1192
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:10,996
Nonpayment of money
due for Annette Kellerman.

1193
01:26:11,132 --> 01:26:12,622
I had an accounting
of all the books

1194
01:26:12,934 --> 01:26:15,596
while you ran the concession.
Among other items,

1195
01:26:15,737 --> 01:26:18,797
there's one marked
two hundred dollars personal.

1196
01:26:18,907 --> 01:26:20,966
You'll have to explain that.

1197
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:24,010
Yes. I'm sorry.

1198
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:30,678
Here's the item.

1199
01:26:31,953 --> 01:26:34,251
You can sell it somewhere.

1200
01:26:34,389 --> 01:26:37,358
Okay, Doc. Let's go.

1201
01:26:37,492 --> 01:26:40,518
Leave the field, lady.

1202
01:26:48,403 --> 01:26:51,600
Thanks for trying, honey.

1203
01:26:56,277 --> 01:27:00,213
Switch on. Turn it on.

1204
01:27:51,065 --> 01:27:53,329
Who say, Frank, would have
the best chance of winning?

1205
01:27:53,468 --> 01:27:55,060
I'm betting Rodneys.

1206
01:27:55,203 --> 01:27:56,602
Well, what about Sullivan?

1207
01:27:58,473 --> 01:27:59,497
In the cracker box,

1208
01:27:59,641 --> 01:28:02,508
I don't see how he has gone
as far as he had.

1209
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:07,905
I'll say one thing
to this air race.

1210
01:28:08,049 --> 01:28:11,280
It certainly captured
the attention of this country.

1211
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:14,312
I'm sorry, Alfred.

1212
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:16,446
You want him very much
to win, don't you?

1213
01:28:16,591 --> 01:28:19,492
I? Well, of course. I mean...

1214
01:28:19,627 --> 01:28:21,618
You figure if he'll have
fifty thousand dollars.

1215
01:28:21,929 --> 01:28:24,625
He can come to you and carry you
off in a white chariot.

1216
01:28:24,932 --> 01:28:29,301
All very simple.
The American success story.

1217
01:28:29,437 --> 01:28:32,998
Darling, I know how importantly
this man has moved you.

1218
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:35,439
But allow me the privilege
of knocking my competition.

1219
01:28:35,576 --> 01:28:38,238
Maybe he will win that pot.
I hope he does.

1220
01:28:38,379 --> 01:28:42,042
But it still won't work.
You're big league.

1221
01:28:42,183 --> 01:28:45,118
Sullivan, he's a little of
the whisk, a cranny man.

1222
01:28:45,253 --> 01:28:46,550
He'll always be up the clouds

1223
01:28:46,688 --> 01:28:47,916
forever looking
for that fast dollar.

1224
01:28:48,056 --> 01:28:50,547
The big bullehu that would make
him seven day to one.

1225
01:28:50,692 --> 01:28:55,425
It probably isn't news
that I love you very much.

1226
01:28:55,563 --> 01:28:59,693
What's most important,
I think I can make you happy.

1227
01:28:59,834 --> 01:29:02,166
Will you marry me, Annette?

1228
01:29:03,571 --> 01:29:06,563
Alfred, believe it or not.

1229
01:29:06,708 --> 01:29:11,577
This is the first marriage
proposal I've ever had.

1230
01:29:11,713 --> 01:29:14,648
It's a little overpowering.

1231
01:29:14,782 --> 01:29:17,342
Well, just say yes.

1232
01:29:19,053 --> 01:29:20,213
Ladies and gentlemen.

1233
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:22,118
We interrupt for a moment
to bring you the latest bulletin

1234
01:29:22,256 --> 01:29:24,952
on the great cross country
flying race.

1235
01:29:25,093 --> 01:29:27,653
Now, five contestants
are still in the running.

1236
01:29:27,962 --> 01:29:29,520
We have news of three of them.

1237
01:29:29,664 --> 01:29:33,828
Bob Gibb traveling Eastwood
has logged five hundred miles

1238
01:29:33,935 --> 01:29:36,062
from Golden Gate Park,
San Francisco.

1239
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:37,501
Carl Rogers and his Memphis

1240
01:29:37,638 --> 01:29:39,868
has just reached
Elmira, New York,

1241
01:29:40,007 --> 01:29:41,907
and James Darling
and his Chesterby plane

1242
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:43,601
has nearing Buffalo.

1243
01:29:43,911 --> 01:29:45,674
Now, three other flyers
had been forced out

1244
01:29:45,813 --> 01:29:47,075
including Jimmy Sullivan,

1245
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:49,445
who has been reportedly
injured in a smash up.

1246
01:29:50,651 --> 01:29:53,814
However, our report said
he managed to right the machine

1247
01:29:53,955 --> 01:29:55,320
and balance it down
to a landing in a town

1248
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:57,014
called Grovers Junction,

1249
01:29:57,158 --> 01:29:59,092
where he has been hospitalized.

1250
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:02,958
Alfred,
I've got to get to a telephone.

1251
01:30:04,165 --> 01:30:06,099
Hello.

1252
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:08,896
Yes, this is the
Grover Memorial Hospital.

1253
01:30:09,036 --> 01:30:12,028
I'd like to
inquire about James sullivan.

1254
01:30:12,173 --> 01:30:14,038
Yes. The Flyer.

1255
01:30:15,309 --> 01:30:16,708
No, he wasn't badly injured.

1256
01:30:17,011 --> 01:30:19,445
He patched up his arm
and he left.

1257
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:22,242
Where did he go?
Can you tell me?

1258
01:30:22,383 --> 01:30:24,180
I'm sorry.

1259
01:30:46,407 --> 01:30:47,567
Neptune's daughter.

1260
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:49,005
That's what I'd call the picture.

1261
01:30:49,143 --> 01:30:50,610
It's a natural for Kellerman.

1262
01:30:50,745 --> 01:30:52,440
And for our underwater
shots in hollywood,

1263
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:54,548
I'll build a giant glass tank.

1264
01:30:54,682 --> 01:30:57,276
We could shoot right through
the glass into Neptune's cage.

1265
01:30:57,418 --> 01:30:58,476
Sounds very interesting, Orson.

1266
01:30:58,619 --> 01:31:00,610
Great challenge,
and a wonderful medium.

1267
01:31:00,755 --> 01:31:02,382
Movies are growing bigger
every day.

1268
01:31:02,523 --> 01:31:03,615
Really. If you could persuade...

1269
01:31:03,925 --> 01:31:05,153
Have you talked to
Miss Kellerman?

1270
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:08,160
I thought you were
handling her affairs.

1271
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:09,888
Well, don't let that fool you.

1272
01:31:10,031 --> 01:31:13,660
I advice her but she's a lady
who makes up her own mind.

1273
01:31:13,801 --> 01:31:17,032
Still, it might be
a good change for her.

1274
01:31:17,171 --> 01:31:19,332
Might even be
a good change for me.

1275
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:21,442
And for you?

1276
01:31:21,576 --> 01:31:24,545
A trip to California, to others.

1277
01:31:24,679 --> 01:31:27,910
Just thinking. There's
a party going on backstage.

1278
01:31:28,049 --> 01:31:30,916
Special performance for the kids
at the orthopedic hospital.

1279
01:31:31,052 --> 01:31:32,679
It's Annette's idea.
Could you join us?

1280
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:34,617
I wish I could
but I'm picking my wife.

1281
01:31:34,755 --> 01:31:36,985
Christmas shopping.
That's too bad.

1282
01:31:40,194 --> 01:31:44,688
Looks like fun for the children.
Annette's a wonderful woman.

1283
01:31:44,832 --> 01:31:46,891
I'm sorry
you can't join us, Mr. Jovi,

1284
01:31:47,001 --> 01:31:48,025
but I'll be
in touch with you later.

1285
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:50,364
I'll be counting on you.
Fine. Good bye.

1286
01:32:10,224 --> 01:32:12,658
Do you know how to work it?
That's good.

1287
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,588
Now, you can find the circus way.

1288
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:19,427
Here's a fine jolly blue dress
for you here.

1289
01:32:19,567 --> 01:32:23,128
There it is.
Another circus present.

1290
01:32:23,271 --> 01:32:25,603
It's a green one.

1291
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:29,642
Here is a mufferjug,
silly elephant.

1292
01:32:44,225 --> 01:32:47,456
This is for you, darling.
Isn't she lovely?

1293
01:32:47,595 --> 01:32:49,085
It's a wonderful party, Annette.

1294
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:50,492
Hello, Alfred.

1295
01:32:50,631 --> 01:32:52,098
Only I'm a little jealous.

1296
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:54,667
Everybody have
a Christmas present but me.

1297
01:32:54,969 --> 01:32:57,597
Poor Alfred. What would you like?

1298
01:32:57,738 --> 01:33:01,674
An answer to that question
I've asked you last June.

1299
01:33:31,505 --> 01:33:33,029
You know, you can have
these genuine Indian blankets

1300
01:33:33,174 --> 01:33:35,301
for a ridiculous price
of three dollars and fifty cents.

1301
01:33:35,443 --> 01:33:36,603
I can assure you, sir,

1302
01:33:36,744 --> 01:33:38,041
you are getting one of
the greatest bargain

1303
01:33:38,179 --> 01:33:40,443
since Manhattan Island that
went for twenty-four dollars.

1304
01:33:40,581 --> 01:33:42,913
But I have no use for a blanket.

1305
01:33:43,050 --> 01:33:44,608
No use for
ordinary blanket perhaps,

1306
01:33:44,752 --> 01:33:46,242
but this special item
is hand-woven

1307
01:33:46,387 --> 01:33:48,116
from the reservations
for gifts to Navajos,

1308
01:33:48,255 --> 01:33:50,519
one of whom
you see here besides me.

1309
01:33:50,658 --> 01:33:53,126
May I present Chief Thunderbird.

1310
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:54,227
How.

1311
01:33:54,362 --> 01:33:58,162
Chief, what is your opinion
to this cloth?

1312
01:33:58,299 --> 01:34:00,233
Product good.

1313
01:34:00,368 --> 01:34:02,029
Please, please, leave me alone.

1314
01:34:02,169 --> 01:34:05,502
I'm not cold.
I don't want a blanket.

1315
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:06,607
Perhaps you'd be interested in

1316
01:34:06,741 --> 01:34:08,299
one of these
beautiful signet rings.

1317
01:34:08,442 --> 01:34:10,205
Hand carved by Indian natives.

1318
01:34:10,344 --> 01:34:13,507
I don't want anything.
I just want to be left alone.

1319
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:18,051
Now, please, please,
get out of here.

1320
01:34:18,185 --> 01:34:20,585
Very well. Good day, sir.

1321
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:28,090
Good afternoon, sir.
Good afternoon, madam.

1322
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:35,625
Annette.

1323
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:41,140
Hello, Doc.
Your feather's crocked.

1324
01:34:42,143 --> 01:34:43,701
Jimmy. Hi, Sullivan.

1325
01:34:43,844 --> 01:34:45,436
Come on in. Sit down.

1326
01:34:45,579 --> 01:34:47,240
How.

1327
01:34:47,381 --> 01:34:50,407
How.

1328
01:34:50,551 --> 01:34:53,850
They're very nice.
Are they handwoven?

1329
01:34:53,988 --> 01:34:56,354
These? I'm just
helping a friend of mine,

1330
01:34:56,490 --> 01:34:58,287
a fellow named Fred Hardy.

1331
01:34:58,426 --> 01:35:01,020
He got himself overloaded with
some big sack of stuff and well,

1332
01:35:01,162 --> 01:35:04,654
he just sort of asked me if
I could help him get rid of them.

1333
01:35:04,965 --> 01:35:08,264
I... I read about
you getting married.

1334
01:35:08,402 --> 01:35:10,996
Yes.
Good idea. It's about time

1335
01:35:11,138 --> 01:35:13,504
you start raising a family
of little swimmers.

1336
01:35:13,641 --> 01:35:14,869
Congratulations.
Thank you.

1337
01:35:15,009 --> 01:35:16,271
All the luck in the world.

1338
01:35:16,410 --> 01:35:17,570
We're not taking a big jump

1339
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:19,646
until Annette finishes
her picture here.

1340
01:35:19,780 --> 01:35:20,974
Why, you're making picture?

1341
01:35:21,115 --> 01:35:22,548
Yes. Neptune's Daughter.

1342
01:35:22,683 --> 01:35:25,151
Great. Glad to hear it.
Great future,

1343
01:35:25,286 --> 01:35:27,015
as a matter of fact,
I got some picture plans myself.

1344
01:35:27,154 --> 01:35:29,952
Garder signs us,
he's on the train.

1345
01:35:30,091 --> 01:35:32,082
Jimmy, if I could be
of any help, I...

1346
01:35:32,226 --> 01:35:33,659
No. I'm in good shape.

1347
01:35:33,794 --> 01:35:34,988
I've got some
important contacts on the coast.

1348
01:35:35,129 --> 01:35:37,620
Well, nice seeing you.
Nice bumping into you.

1349
01:35:37,765 --> 01:35:40,598
Best of luck, Annette.
Thank you, Doc.

1350
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:42,066
There you are.

1351
01:35:42,203 --> 01:35:45,172
Didn't I warn you about taking
this dog out of the baggage cart?

1352
01:35:45,306 --> 01:35:45,965
Just a moment, conductor.

1353
01:35:46,107 --> 01:35:48,541
This isn't just an ordinary dog,
this is a highly trained animal

1354
01:35:48,676 --> 01:35:50,109
who's going to be
a movie star in six months.

1355
01:35:50,244 --> 01:35:51,506
I don't care
if he's plan is exbus,

1356
01:35:51,645 --> 01:35:52,703
but he doesn't
belong in the lower deck

1357
01:35:53,013 --> 01:35:54,947
frightening the passenger.

1358
01:35:55,082 --> 01:35:56,310
And as for you,

1359
01:35:56,450 --> 01:35:58,611
you look like the man
I kicked off in Albaclerk.

1360
01:35:58,753 --> 01:36:01,017
Me? But that's
perfectly ridiculous.

1361
01:36:01,155 --> 01:36:02,315
How.
Don't give me that how business.

1362
01:36:02,456 --> 01:36:03,582
You didn't pay your fare...

1363
01:36:03,724 --> 01:36:04,656
Conductor, look.

1364
01:36:04,959 --> 01:36:06,256
Couldn't we discuss
somewhere else?

1365
01:36:06,393 --> 01:36:07,519
You know,
you're probably not aware,

1366
01:36:07,661 --> 01:36:09,356
but there's a new Act
just passed by the Congress,

1367
01:36:09,497 --> 01:36:10,896
an Indian on his way
to his reservation

1368
01:36:11,031 --> 01:36:12,362
is entitled to
free transportation.

1369
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:13,592
I know of no such Act.

1370
01:36:13,901 --> 01:36:15,232
I resent your tone, sir.

1371
01:36:15,369 --> 01:36:16,233
As a matter of fact,

1372
01:36:16,370 --> 01:36:19,134
I've got plenty of
cash here in my...

1373
01:36:19,273 --> 01:36:22,436
This is ridiculous,
absolutely ridiculous, sir.

1374
01:36:22,576 --> 01:36:25,568
Would you like me to see
what I can do for them?

1375
01:36:25,713 --> 01:36:28,113
No. No, I'll do it.

1376
01:36:28,249 --> 01:36:30,683
Forgive me, Alfred.

1377
01:36:38,292 --> 01:36:41,318
Yale, did you say? Yale, Harvard,
Princeton, take your pick.

1378
01:36:41,462 --> 01:36:43,225
You want yourself to have
a college education, don't you?

1379
01:36:43,364 --> 01:36:45,195
Of course.
Can you imagine on your salary?

1380
01:36:45,332 --> 01:36:47,698
You know damn well I can't.
Alright, then. Be smart.

1381
01:36:47,835 --> 01:36:49,200
The movie picture business
is growing fast

1382
01:36:49,336 --> 01:36:51,497
and this dog
will take the country by storm.

1383
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:53,630
Watch. Burglar.

1384
01:36:57,378 --> 01:36:59,005
Pretty girl.

1385
01:37:01,448 --> 01:37:02,779
He certainly is clever.

1386
01:37:02,883 --> 01:37:05,044
Clever. You haven't seen
one-tenth of his bag of tricks.

1387
01:37:05,186 --> 01:37:06,778
And remember this,
no overhead, no salary,

1388
01:37:06,887 --> 01:37:08,377
no expenses other than his food,

1389
01:37:08,522 --> 01:37:10,319
and it's not going to
cost you one dime.

1390
01:37:10,457 --> 01:37:13,620
I'm gonna cut you in simply
for being a good sport.

1391
01:37:13,761 --> 01:37:19,165
Well... I can't very well put you
off in the middle of the dessert.

1392
01:37:20,467 --> 01:37:22,025
How.

1393
01:37:26,407 --> 01:37:28,272
Let's have a
good scene now, boys.

1394
01:37:28,409 --> 01:37:29,637
Make the audience believe it.

1395
01:37:29,777 --> 01:37:33,577
Make them believe it.
Now, take in the money.

1396
01:37:33,714 --> 01:37:36,080
Play that piano
a little bit louder.

1397
01:37:36,217 --> 01:37:37,946
That's it.

1398
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:51,955
Alright, come on. Light them up.

1399
01:37:52,099 --> 01:37:54,090
Go. Give him your position.

1400
01:37:54,235 --> 01:37:55,998
Let's run through it again.

1401
01:37:56,136 --> 01:37:57,865
Sam, come over here.

1402
01:37:57,972 --> 01:38:00,338
Move it along, will ya?

1403
01:38:00,474 --> 01:38:04,808
Joe, get over there and help him.
We haven't got all day. Come on.

1404
01:38:04,912 --> 01:38:06,641
The Hippodrome
was never like this was it?

1405
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:08,975
Frankly, no.
You people don't stay in one spot

1406
01:38:09,116 --> 01:38:10,276
long enough to get acquainted.

1407
01:38:10,417 --> 01:38:12,009
Well, with luck,
we'll do it today.

1408
01:38:12,152 --> 01:38:13,983
But I tell you, I haven't been
so high on a picture,

1409
01:38:14,121 --> 01:38:16,589
you can believe me.
Annette is simply wonderful.

1410
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:19,052
Now, if I can persuade you
both to postpone your honeymoon.

1411
01:38:19,193 --> 01:38:20,956
We leave tonight.

1412
01:38:21,095 --> 01:38:22,619
Well. I was only
thinking out loud.

1413
01:38:22,930 --> 01:38:25,831
Let's get more scene
around that cave.

1414
01:38:25,933 --> 01:38:27,594
Keep that water coming.

1415
01:38:27,902 --> 01:38:30,166
Holding fifty galleons now.

1416
01:38:30,304 --> 01:38:31,635
Can we raise the level?

1417
01:38:31,939 --> 01:38:33,463
That's glass, you know.

1418
01:38:33,607 --> 01:38:36,440
We built it pretty solid
but why take the chances.

1419
01:38:36,577 --> 01:38:37,874
Alright, you're the doctor.

1420
01:38:38,012 --> 01:38:39,570
So Bill,
you think we can go for a take?

1421
01:38:39,713 --> 01:38:41,237
Any time.

1422
01:38:41,382 --> 01:38:43,111
Robbie. Yes, sir.

1423
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:44,581
Miss Kellerman in five minutes.
Yes, sir.

1424
01:38:44,718 --> 01:38:47,687
I'll get her.
Well, thanks, Mr. Harper.

1425
01:38:52,593 --> 01:38:54,857
Yes. You're wanted
on the set, darling.

1426
01:38:54,962 --> 01:38:57,829
Alright, I'm ready.

1427
01:38:57,965 --> 01:38:59,592
Put it out.

1428
01:38:59,733 --> 01:39:02,327
Neptune's Daughter.

1429
01:39:02,469 --> 01:39:05,165
Alfred, be careful. My make-up.

1430
01:39:05,306 --> 01:39:06,637
Well, this is it, sweetheart.

1431
01:39:06,774 --> 01:39:10,232
Garvey said you're
all through after the scene.

1432
01:39:10,377 --> 01:39:13,437
You've been very patient
with all these, Alfred.

1433
01:39:13,580 --> 01:39:15,343
It's just a pause.

1434
01:39:15,482 --> 01:39:18,576
I've never been
so impatient in my life.

1435
01:39:38,272 --> 01:39:41,241
Is this what you're looking for?

1436
01:39:41,375 --> 01:39:44,310
Yes. Yes. It's sort of
a good luck charm,

1437
01:39:44,445 --> 01:39:49,610
I wear it whenever
I'm performing.

1438
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:53,481
Silly, isn't it?

1439
01:39:53,620 --> 01:39:55,053
Well.

1440
01:40:00,995 --> 01:40:03,259
Yeah, sure. Ready, Annette?

1441
01:40:03,397 --> 01:40:04,159
Ready. Okay.

1442
01:40:04,298 --> 01:40:06,095
Let's get it the first time.

1443
01:40:06,233 --> 01:40:09,031
Places, everybody.

1444
01:40:09,169 --> 01:40:10,295
Good luck, honey.

1445
01:40:10,437 --> 01:40:13,065
When you get up from the top,
wave if you can hear me.

1446
01:40:13,207 --> 01:40:15,107
Right.

1447
01:40:15,242 --> 01:40:18,177
Alright, come on. Come on.
Move it along, boys, will ya?

1448
01:40:18,312 --> 01:40:20,644
Alright,
get that stuff out of here.

1449
01:40:20,948 --> 01:40:22,677
Come on. Come on. Hurry it up.

1450
01:40:41,268 --> 01:40:44,294
Fill in the tank.
Go on. Get ready.

1451
01:40:44,438 --> 01:40:45,666
Now places for everybody.

1452
01:40:45,973 --> 01:40:47,736
As soon as she came out
of the cave,

1453
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:49,433
dive down and tide.

1454
01:40:49,576 --> 01:40:53,273
Now, stand by.
Let's get at first tape.

1455
01:40:55,682 --> 01:40:58,947
Annette, can you hear me?

1456
01:40:59,086 --> 01:41:00,883
Come forward a little bit.

1457
01:41:01,021 --> 01:41:03,046
More. That's it.

1458
01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:05,249
Okay, we got it now.
Okay, Bill.

1459
01:41:05,392 --> 01:41:07,223
Okay. Ready, sir.

1460
01:41:07,361 --> 01:41:08,658
Alright.

1461
01:41:08,962 --> 01:41:10,088
Music.

1462
01:41:13,167 --> 01:41:17,331
Camera. Action.

1463
01:41:45,232 --> 01:41:47,496
Alright, girls. Get ready.

1464
01:42:07,621 --> 01:42:09,680
The glass is breaking.
Get her out of there.

1465
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:11,082
Look out.

1466
01:42:11,225 --> 01:42:13,591
Come on. Get her out of there.
Get her out of there.

1467
01:42:38,118 --> 01:42:40,586
Watch out. Watch out.

1468
01:42:42,689 --> 01:42:44,520
Are you okay?

1469
01:43:01,175 --> 01:43:02,403
Please, nurse. I must see her.

1470
01:43:02,543 --> 01:43:04,374
I've been waiting here every day
for the past two weeks.

1471
01:43:04,511 --> 01:43:08,003
I'm sorry, sir. Strict orders
have been issued. No visitors.

1472
01:43:08,148 --> 01:43:10,241
Let me talk to the doctor.

1473
01:43:10,384 --> 01:43:13,876
If you'll wait,
I'll try to get a report for you.

1474
01:43:20,661 --> 01:43:23,926
Hello, Sullivan.

1475
01:43:24,698 --> 01:43:26,632
Mr. Harper, I...
I know.

1476
01:43:26,934 --> 01:43:30,165
Come along with me.
It's alright, Grace.

1477
01:43:41,848 --> 01:43:43,577
How is she?

1478
01:43:43,717 --> 01:43:45,514
We'll know this morning.

1479
01:43:56,964 --> 01:43:58,363
Good morning, Mr. Harper.
Good morning.

1480
01:43:58,498 --> 01:44:00,090
The doctor
is in Miss Kellerman's room.

1481
01:44:00,234 --> 01:44:02,293
Thank you.

1482
01:44:06,006 --> 01:44:07,200
Good morning, Doctor.
Good morning.

1483
01:44:07,341 --> 01:44:08,330
This is Mr. Sullivan.

1484
01:44:08,475 --> 01:44:09,669
Mr. Sullivan
How do you do?

1485
01:44:09,810 --> 01:44:10,936
Is there any news?

1486
01:44:11,078 --> 01:44:14,445
She's resting comfortably.
I think we were wise to offer it.

1487
01:44:14,581 --> 01:44:16,105
Well, when will she be able to
leave the hospital?

1488
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:18,912
I don't know. I don't know.

1489
01:44:19,052 --> 01:44:21,418
Mr. Harper,
I think I can speak plainly.

1490
01:44:21,555 --> 01:44:22,886
Miss Kellerman's spine
has suffered

1491
01:44:23,023 --> 01:44:26,959
a severe blow, what we called
a spinal cord hematoma,

1492
01:44:27,094 --> 01:44:28,391
and we believe
the pressure, unfortunately,

1493
01:44:28,528 --> 01:44:31,019
was no severance
to the nerve tracks.

1494
01:44:31,164 --> 01:44:32,529
She will have to face
the possibility that

1495
01:44:32,666 --> 01:44:35,999
she may not have the use
of her legs for sometime.

1496
01:44:36,136 --> 01:44:37,296
Did you tell this to her?

1497
01:44:37,437 --> 01:44:38,096
She insists on knowing.

1498
01:44:38,238 --> 01:44:40,103
I saw no reason
of withholding from her.

1499
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:42,902
I'd rather she didn't
have any visitors right now.

1500
01:44:43,043 --> 01:44:46,604
I understand. Thank you.

1501
01:44:49,883 --> 01:44:51,714
I know how much of a blow
this is, Mr. Harper.

1502
01:44:52,019 --> 01:44:53,680
But whatever sooner
possible to do,

1503
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:55,082
we'll do for her.

1504
01:44:55,222 --> 01:44:57,986
The rest is up to Miss Kellerman.
Her own recuperative power,

1505
01:44:58,125 --> 01:44:59,683
her health, her will.

1506
01:44:59,993 --> 01:45:02,553
Thank you, Doctor.
I know we're in capable hands.

1507
01:45:02,696 --> 01:45:03,594
Will check with you
later in the day.

1508
01:45:03,897 --> 01:45:05,626
Very well.

1509
01:45:07,968 --> 01:45:10,198
Well I...

1510
01:45:13,507 --> 01:45:16,601
Perhaps you would like to
sleep for a while.

1511
01:45:39,566 --> 01:45:42,501
Hello, baby.

1512
01:45:42,636 --> 01:45:43,694
I was just passing the hospital

1513
01:45:43,837 --> 01:45:46,829
and thought I'd look in.

1514
01:45:46,973 --> 01:45:49,168
Jimmy.

1515
01:45:49,309 --> 01:45:52,278
I've been here everyday
for the past two weeks.

1516
01:45:52,412 --> 01:45:54,676
That nurse downstairs is a clam.

1517
01:45:54,981 --> 01:45:57,541
She wouldn't tell me anything.

1518
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:02,088
You're looking swell.

1519
01:46:02,222 --> 01:46:06,818
I feel fine.
A little rocky, maybe.

1520
01:46:06,927 --> 01:46:09,521
I'm going to be up
and around in no time at all.

1521
01:46:09,663 --> 01:46:11,426
That's great.

1522
01:46:11,565 --> 01:46:15,296
It's just a sprain,
it's stuff like this.

1523
01:46:15,435 --> 01:46:17,528
How's Doc? Fine.

1524
01:46:17,671 --> 01:46:20,435
And your picture?
Wrapped them. It's all finished.

1525
01:46:20,574 --> 01:46:23,509
We're taking the print
to New York tonight.

1526
01:46:23,643 --> 01:46:26,612
I've heard nothing
but good things about it.

1527
01:46:26,747 --> 01:46:29,944
Imagine, starring a dog.

1528
01:46:30,083 --> 01:46:32,916
What's his name?
Rintintin.

1529
01:46:33,053 --> 01:46:35,613
What funny name. Chinese?

1530
01:46:35,922 --> 01:46:38,049
French.

1531
01:46:39,926 --> 01:46:42,622
Annette, darling.
Jimmy.

1532
01:46:42,763 --> 01:46:45,664
Baby, don't let it
get you, please.

1533
01:46:45,799 --> 01:46:49,030
That doctor, he may know medicine

1534
01:46:49,169 --> 01:46:52,696
but there's lot of things
about people he doesn't know.

1535
01:46:52,839 --> 01:46:53,897
He doesn't know
about a little girl

1536
01:46:54,040 --> 01:46:56,634
that lived back in Australia.

1537
01:46:56,943 --> 01:46:59,844
They told her
the same thing, too.

1538
01:46:59,946 --> 01:47:04,781
He doesn't know how she hopped
every day to the water.

1539
01:47:04,885 --> 01:47:07,615
Learning to swim
before she could walk.

1540
01:47:07,921 --> 01:47:11,823
How she became the greatest
aquatic star in the world.

1541
01:47:11,925 --> 01:47:14,587
There's lot of things
that doctors don't know,

1542
01:47:14,728 --> 01:47:20,667
including what I once told you.
Wet, you're terrific.

1543
01:47:20,801 --> 01:47:24,601
Dry, you'll marry some guy
and settle down.

1544
01:47:26,039 --> 01:47:28,007
Jimmy.

1545
01:47:28,141 --> 01:47:31,372
I have more to tell you.

1546
01:47:31,511 --> 01:47:36,847
It ain't going to be the same,
baby, you and Harper.

1547
01:47:36,950 --> 01:47:38,508
He's a terrific guy.

1548
01:47:38,652 --> 01:47:41,644
Unlucky is the better word.

1549
01:47:41,788 --> 01:47:42,652
Alfred.

1550
01:47:42,789 --> 01:47:44,518
What Sullivan says
is right, darling.

1551
01:47:44,658 --> 01:47:46,250
You'll beat this thing
the same way

1552
01:47:46,393 --> 01:47:48,327
you have beaten everything else.

1553
01:47:48,462 --> 01:47:50,123
As for you, I don't know
why you should

1554
01:47:50,263 --> 01:47:53,699
get this kind of a break.
You don't rate it.

1555
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,663
You've struck gold and never
have the sense to make a claim.

1556
01:47:57,804 --> 01:47:59,533
You're a crazy,
vagabond Irish man

1557
01:47:59,673 --> 01:48:03,074
with both feet
planted in mid-air.

1558
01:48:03,210 --> 01:48:05,576
I'm not sure
what the doctor ordered.

1559
01:48:05,712 --> 01:48:08,943
Just see that you make her happy.

1560
01:48:10,016 --> 01:48:12,007
Alfred.

1561
01:48:15,088 --> 01:48:17,022
Good bye, darling.

1562
01:48:17,157 --> 01:48:19,455
She'll be up and around
soon rehearsing a new act.

1563
01:48:19,593 --> 01:48:21,561
And when you do, remember,

1564
01:48:21,695 --> 01:48:24,664
I'm holding your contract
at the Hippodrome.

1565
01:48:29,302 --> 01:48:31,896
Yes.

1566
01:48:33,940 --> 01:48:36,875
This doesn't belong to me.

1567
01:48:46,219 --> 01:48:51,088
It doesn't belong to you either.
