1
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,866
Watch this
contestant attack his slice.

2
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,836
And it's a new record!

3
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:43,507
It's a battle to consume

4
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:44,974
the most watermelon

5
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,045
in the shortest time.

6
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,510
this one wants the plate too!

7
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,645
And now for the
pip-spitting competition.

8
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:54,384
this contestant's meager performance

9
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,385
causes general hilarity.

10
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:00,383
Even the children beat him.

11
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,116
this one has the knack,

12
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,422
he spits it more than 30 feet!

13
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,362
but with no front teeth,

14
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:09,263
you drop your pip before you spit!

15
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,674
The price of watermelon
is now so low

16
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,174
that it's more profitable

17
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,439
to sell the juice
and the market is awash!

18
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:24,548
Guess the price of a 24 oz. jug?

19
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:25,912
15 Taiwan dollars.

20
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,043
Cheaper than mineral water!

21
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:29,447
Everybody's drinking it

22
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,717
and now ex-congressmen
want in on the market.

23
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:33,848
Look at the figures:

24
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,358
this juice bar

25
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,793
is taking in 50,000 dollars a day.

26
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:42,962
that's a cool.

27
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,434
1,500,000 dollars per month.

28
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:28,279
And watermelon can open your heart!
It's the ideal way to send a message.

29
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:29,039
Of course

30
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,376
In this summer day

31
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:34,509
there's no better
or cheaper method!

32
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,554
It lets you express

33
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:40,216
what you can't say out loud.

34
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,418
there's a whole lovers' code:

35
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:45,224
a small yellow one

36
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:48,026
means you're just good friends.

37
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,829
A big red one

38
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,528
means you're wildly in love.

39
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,936
And regular melons,

40
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,507
despite their small size,

41
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,406
are reserved

42
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,137
for the most ardent passion!

43
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,713
Here you see

44
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,477
a group of students,

45
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:09,247
too shy to declare their love,

46
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:10,855
going out with "guardian angels "

47
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,584
friends dressed as watermelons

48
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,284
to deliver watermelons

49
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:18,886
to the girls' dormitories.

50
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,726
When the girls receive them

51
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,267
they blush,

52
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:26,030
and their hearts swell with pride.

53
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,069
the river bed is almost dry,

54
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,939
even upstream.

55
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,203
these low rain levels

56
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,439
don't normally occur until february.

57
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:12,142
The dry weather covers a wide area:

58
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,512
the vast majority of rivers

59
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,314
are affected.

60
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,251
A severe drought

61
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,721
can therefore be expected.

62
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,615
Weather patterns in recent years

63
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,921
and low water stocks

64
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,465
are fueling the sense of alarm.

65
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,660
Invest in buckets to store water!

66
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,998
We are going to
suffer a serious drought

67
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,808
but water,buy bucket,keep water.

68
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:41,207
Our sales are up 150%.

69
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:42,939
business is booming.

70
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:47,348
Get your water buckets here!
Top quality guaranteed!

71
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,288
The Yilan mineral water company

72
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,394
has trebled its output.

73
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:58,793
Two-gallon flagons
are especially in demand.

74
00:09:58,931 --> 00:09:59,693
Not only flagons,

75
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:02,460
suppliers of water-coolers
are also delighted

76
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:06,360
and have stepped up deliveries
to 7 days a week.

77
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,970
Taiwan is in the grips of panic

78
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,237
over the widespread drought.

79
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:17,145
The main reservoir
has become a cause for concern.

80
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:18,874
the water level,

81
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,349
which is still falling,
is now only 107 feet.

82
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,119
Taps are dry from 2 pm to 10 pm

83
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,025
and everyday life is in turmoil.

84
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,582
What are you looking for?

85
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,793
My keys.

86
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,089
Ain't no keys here.

87
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,269
Move out of the way.
Don't stand there.

88
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,369
Listen, lady,
there ain't no keys here.

89
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:29,275
It's dangerous.

90
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,610
We got work to do.

91
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,046
There ain't no keys.

92
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:40,989
Stop hanging around.

93
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,938
There ain't no keys, I said.

94
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,375
The strategy from Congress

95
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,882
is to invoke higher authority.

96
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:09,854
Taiwan is so dry.

97
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:13,987
May there be rains from on high

98
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:18,088
from our people and Congress,
hear our cry!

99
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,021
Do you want rain in Taiwan?

100
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:21,199
Yes.

101
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,630
Do you want rain in Taiwan?

102
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:23,928
Yes.

103
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:11,579
What's up?

104
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,887
She's got ants.

105
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,694
Here.

106
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:14,258
No nightingale's sweet tune
No flowers in bloom

107
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:20,966
Can soothe my heart so blue

108
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:29,113
I look out from my room
Amid my gloom

109
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:35,981
And there alone is a half-moon

110
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:44,260
No bright shining star
No cloud from afar

111
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:50,961
Only in my dreams do I find you

112
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:59,208
I've only my memories
to carry me through

113
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:05,411
And there alone is that half-moon

114
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:13,288
the poor moon's torn apart

115
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:21,255
It's lost half its heart

116
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:28,969
Is it shining down there on you?

117
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:36,041
Our old dreams
never will come true

118
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:44,547
Cold neon lights
Long shadows in the night

119
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:51,456
They make my lonesome soul so blue

120
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:59,727
the night breeze stirs in my room

121
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:06,944
And still alone is that half-moon

122
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:31,330
The night breeze stirs in my room

123
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:41,036
And still alone is that half-moon

124
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,032
Are you still selling watches?

125
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,402
The first day that we met

126
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:23,844
We knew we never would forget

127
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:34,015
this everlasting love
Such unforgettable love

128
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:39,294
Like the two wings of a dove

129
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:43,730
Side by side up above

130
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:46,770
Look at me,

131
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:50,704
don't be sulky, don't be sulky

132
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:57,044
I'll be everything you need

133
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:59,743
the first day that we met

134
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:04,253
We knew we never would forget

135
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:08,882
this everlasting love

136
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:14,430
Such unforgettable love

137
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:19,700
As two trees grow intertwined

138
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:24,934
the highest love we will find

139
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,976
Look at me,

140
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:31,207
stand by me, stand by me

141
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:36,918
I'll be everything you need

142
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:40,150
the first day that we met

143
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:44,660
We knew we never would forget

144
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:49,389
this everlasting love

145
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:53,400
Such unforgettable love

146
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:04,475
As two trees grow intertwined

147
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:09,275
the highest love we will find

148
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:11,646
Look at me,

149
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:16,023
stand by me, stand by me

150
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:21,760
I'll be everything you need

151
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,994
the first day that we met

152
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:29,470
We knew we never would forget

153
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:34,134
this everlasting love

154
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:37,680
Such unforgettable love

155
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:45,449
How could we forget
the day that we met

156
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:39,424
No more water?

157
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,589
I don't believe this!

158
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:18,068
Go get some!

159
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:20,408
Get a move on!

160
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:40,629
I can't find my eyelashes!

161
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:53,034
Can you see my lashes?

162
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:54,337
What?

163
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:36,472
I haven't a sou

164
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,140
but a heart, yes I do

165
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:47,853
And this heart, I tell you.

166
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:55,624
Is loving and warm

167
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:03,397
but so sad and forlorn.

168
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:09,003
I've been so often betrayed

169
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:20,048
by men brutal and jaded.

170
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:26,185
So often degraded.

171
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:29,988
And so, come what may
I'd throw everything away

172
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:37,702
Rather than lead my heart astray

173
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:54,689
I haven't a sou

174
00:49:55,359 --> 00:50:01,787
I'd sell my soul too

175
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:09,935
to keep my heart true

176
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:18,672
to keep my heart true

177
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:50,504
I haven't a sou

178
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:58,180
I'd sell my soul too

179
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:05,918
to keep my heart true

180
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:13,933
to keep my heart true

181
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:56,657
I crawl out of bed
And shake my sleepy head

182
00:59:56,793 --> 01:00:00,251
Suddenly it dawns on me
I got the whole day free

183
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:04,030
I have a date with lovely Chen,
I must look good, but then

184
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:07,633
I see my shoes, what a fright
the left foot's on the right!

185
01:00:26,756 --> 01:00:30,192
Already I am running late
I mustn't make her wait

186
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:33,926
I see her with her back to me
She looks like harmony

187
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:37,628
to show her that I think she's bliss
I plant a big wet kiss

188
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:41,492
She turns around and punches me
It wasn't Chen, you see

189
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:34,721
Later comes the real Miss Chen
It's way past 12 by then

190
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:38,618
I tell her that I hate to wait
And ask her why she's late

191
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:42,395
She still has slippers on
Her skirt is hitched up wrong

192
01:01:42,665 --> 01:01:46,157
turns out that she's as scared as me
And nervous as can be

193
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:08,888
Oh what fun we had that day
the time just slipped away

194
01:02:09,325 --> 01:02:12,658
We danced and had a walk
And sat down for a talk

195
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:16,461
but when I see it's time to go
Oh, what a fearful blow

196
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:20,733
She wasn't Chen, her name was
Hsiao And she thought I was Zhao

197
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:13,409
the cap's inside the Japanese girl.

198
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:16,409
Lin

199
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:22,752
What do you want?

200
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:26,226
Fish that cap out.

201
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:16,556
Need a hand?

202
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:04,369
Don't look down, don't look back.

203
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:07,901
Look straight ahead
and find your track

204
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:11,773
Follow it with a fearless stride

205
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:15,413
And happiness will be your prize

206
01:14:15,851 --> 01:14:19,116
Gently let your spirits rise

207
01:14:19,588 --> 01:14:22,785
Walk straight
on with head held high

208
01:14:23,225 --> 01:14:26,456
All obstacles you'll put aside

209
01:14:26,829 --> 01:14:31,664
for happiness you need to strive

210
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:41,735
be sure to keep
your eyes on the goal

211
01:14:41,877 --> 01:14:45,176
And share your joy with one and all

212
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:48,946
follow the path with fearless stride

213
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:52,685
And happiness will be your prize

214
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:56,284
Gently let your spirits rise

215
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:59,886
Walk straight
on with head held high

216
01:15:00,429 --> 01:15:03,762
All obstacles you'll put aside

217
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:09,435
for happiness you have to strive

218
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:18,708
Don't look down, don't look back

219
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:22,344
Look straight ahead
and find your track

220
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:26,246
follow it with a fearless stride

221
01:15:26,588 --> 01:15:29,853
And happiness will be your prize

222
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:33,653
Gently let your spirits rise

223
01:15:34,129 --> 01:15:37,257
Walk straight
on with head held high

224
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:41,098
All obstacles you'll put aside

225
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:46,440
for happiness
you need to strive-

226
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:12,949
back to work.

227
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:34,134
Come on...

228
01:38:55,629 --> 01:38:56,721
Wipe her down.

229
01:38:57,765 --> 01:38:58,629
Sit her up.

230
01:38:59,633 --> 01:39:01,260
OK, wipe her back.

231
01:39:05,005 --> 01:39:07,132
turn her over.

232
01:39:11,211 --> 01:39:13,441
turn her over,

233
01:39:49,116 --> 01:39:50,606
Come on.

234
01:40:25,652 --> 01:40:26,710
take those off her.

235
01:40:29,456 --> 01:40:30,445
that's good.
I need you up higher.

236
01:40:48,375 --> 01:40:49,706
that's better. OK, next.

237
01:40:54,148 --> 01:40:56,582
Get a hold of her breasts.

238
01:40:56,850 --> 01:40:57,680
that's good.

239
01:40:57,818 --> 01:40:58,807
Good. Fondle them, that's it.

240
01:41:00,254 --> 01:41:01,186
hands

241
01:41:01,321 --> 01:41:03,551
Higher,and touch her breasts, and...

242
01:41:42,629 --> 01:41:43,618
Lie her back.

243
01:41:46,700 --> 01:41:48,634
Lie her down.

244
01:41:48,769 --> 01:41:49,701
All the way down!

245
01:41:50,270 --> 01:41:52,067
That's right. Good!

246
01:42:11,191 --> 01:42:12,021
Give it here.

247
01:42:15,129 --> 01:42:16,153
Put it down

248
01:42:19,967 --> 01:42:20,899
Like this.

249
01:42:23,270 --> 01:42:24,567
Ok,come on

250
01:42:24,705 --> 01:42:26,536
Ok, like this.

251
01:42:47,394 --> 01:42:47,985
I'm beat.

252
01:42:48,128 --> 01:42:49,390
Keep going. Harder!

253
01:42:49,530 --> 01:42:50,554
Keep going.

254
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:54,858
I tell you what to do.

255
01:42:55,002 --> 01:42:56,094
OK, sitting position.

256
01:43:10,150 --> 01:43:11,276
Hold her there.

257
01:43:14,321 --> 01:43:15,583
That's good.

258
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:21,092
Come on

259
01:44:08,075 --> 01:44:08,905
Move.

260
01:44:32,699 --> 01:44:34,564
Open, wide open.

261
01:44:43,810 --> 01:44:45,072
Take off your hands.

262
01:44:48,982 --> 01:44:49,812
Come on.

263
01:45:11,571 --> 01:45:14,233
Come on, lie down.

264
01:45:17,978 --> 01:45:19,036
this...

265
01:45:20,647 --> 01:45:21,978
Come on, I'll do it.

266
01:45:23,550 --> 01:45:24,778
Lie down.

267
01:45:25,052 --> 01:45:26,610
Come on, I'll do it.

268
01:50:42,102 --> 01:50:49,668
A wayward cloud...
Lonesome and proud.

269
01:50:50,677 --> 01:50:58,914
Slipping through my hand
to a far-off land

270
01:50:59,352 --> 01:51:02,981
My heartless love

271
01:51:03,723 --> 01:51:06,556
Drifting high above

272
01:51:08,128 --> 01:51:11,757
Drifting high above

273
01:51:12,332 --> 01:51:16,098
Like a wayward cloud

274
01:51:18,038 --> 01:51:22,737
With no earthly bound

275
01:51:22,876 --> 01:51:26,573
His lonely hours pass like
wilting flowers

276
01:51:27,047 --> 01:51:31,279
As he watches life drift by

277
01:51:31,785 --> 01:51:34,083
A sole shadow, with the world below
Like a wayward cloud

278
01:51:39,092 --> 01:51:47,090
A wayward cloud
Lonesome and proud

279
01:51:48,001 --> 01:51:56,033
Slipping through my hand
to a far-off land

280
01:51:56,509 --> 01:52:04,814
My heartless love
Drifting high above

281
01:52:05,385 --> 01:52:09,151
Drifting high above

282
01:52:09,956 --> 01:52:13,517
Like a wayward cloud

283
01:52:15,361 --> 01:52:19,991
My love like to travel around the world

284
01:52:20,266 --> 01:52:26,068
Everywhere is home the wind blow
he horse run

285
01:52:26,206 --> 01:52:29,039
travel to far-off land

286
01:52:29,175 --> 01:52:35,410
and leave me behind
thinking of him day and night

287
01:52:36,049 --> 01:52:44,354
A sole shadow,
with the world below

288
01:52:44,958 --> 01:52:53,423
Like a wayward cloud

289
01:52:53,833 --> 01:52:57,633
My heartless love

290
01:52:58,204 --> 01:53:02,163
Drifting high above

291
01:53:02,742 --> 01:53:06,610
Drifting high above

292
01:53:07,147 --> 01:53:10,913
Like a wayward cloud
With no earthly bound
