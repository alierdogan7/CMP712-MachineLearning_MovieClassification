This story take you way,
way back to another era - 1927.

3
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:11,361
That was the year
they were dancing the Charleston -

4
00:02:12,285 --> 00:02:15,229
The year Coolidge
did not choose to run -

5
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:18,429
The year Will Rogers was elected
mayor of Beverly Hills -

6
00:02:19,355 --> 00:02:23,440
The year of "flaming you" -whe a girl
was a flapper- and a boy was a sheik.

7
00:02:24,027 --> 00:02:27,258
''T'' is for ''Tait'' College

00:02:27,463 --> 00:02:30,762
T-A-l-T, Tait! Hooray!

9
00:02:30,967 --> 00:02:33,936
''A'' is for ''A'' college

10
00:02:34,137 --> 00:02:37,163
Where students never want to graduate

12
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:44,280
Intercollegiate fame

00:02:44,814 --> 00:02:47,408
''T'' is for the Tait ''Team''

14
00:02:47,617 --> 00:02:49,380
It's such a great team

15
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,749
Tait's prowess on the field
Is known to fame

16
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,286
For athletically, there's no team

17
00:02:56,492 --> 00:03:00,485
- Like the Tait football team
- Boom diddy bah, diddy bah, Tait

18
00:03:00,697 --> 00:03:04,098
Tait's the team we're rooting for
The team we're rooting for

19
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,667
Tait's the team that's won before
That's always won before

You're what I've waited for

27
00:03:27,557 --> 00:03:29,047
That's what I'm slaving for

28
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:32,160
Good news is so

29
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,329
- Good to me
- To me, to me, to me, to me

30
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:39,660

Come right here to me, good news

35
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:55,381
Have you heard the good news?

36
00:03:55,585 --> 00:03:58,850
Gonna be good news

37
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:01,216
Gotta have good news

38
00:04:01,424 --> 00:04:03,824
So we're saying bye-bye, bad news

39
00:04:04,027 --> 00:04:07,190
Hello! Goody, good news!

40
00:04:09,265 --> 00:04:13,292
T-A-I-T, T-A-I-T, T-A-I-T
Tait! Hooray!

41
00:04:15,405 --> 00:04:16,838
- Hi, Babe.
- Hi, gang.

42
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,498
- We're gonna watch football practice.
- No, thank you.

43
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,268
Hey, there's the dean.

44
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:24,639
- Wow, get a load of that!
- Who is it?

45
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:27,179
She's the new pledgee, Pat McClellan.

46
00:04:27,383 --> 00:04:30,875
A transfer from
the Black Briar Finishing School.

47
00:04:31,087 --> 00:04:35,421
- And I do hope you'll like it here.
- I love it already, Dean Griswold.

48
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,890
You've been absolutely charmant.

49
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:42,898
- Goodbye, Miss McClellan.
- Au revoir!

50
00:04:53,343 --> 00:04:55,106
- Hello, Babe.
- Hello, McClellan.

51
00:04:55,311 --> 00:04:58,178
- Everybody, this is Pat McClellan.
- Hi, Pat.

52
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,214
Enchantée. Enchantée.

53
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,380
Hey, wait'll Tommy Marlowe
gets a load of that!

54
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:10,353
- How men'll fall for a pretty face.
- You said it.

55
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,120
- Last chance to go to the field.
- Aw, football!

56
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:15,923
- What are we waiting for?
- Come on, let's go.

57
00:05:16,632 --> 00:05:20,864
Fellows, I hate to say it, but that was
a pretty nice practice. Thompson...

58
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,503
...watch your passing.

59
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:26,232
Zubrowski, nice broken field running.

60
00:05:26,442 --> 00:05:28,103
Beef, I'll get to you later.

61
00:05:28,311 --> 00:05:30,404
- What are you doing?
- I'm warming up.

62
00:05:30,613 --> 00:05:33,844
- Can't hang up a cold uniform.
- Bobby, get your uniform off.

63
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,508
I never get to wear it. I like to
keep it on till the last minute.

64
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,417
I even rub a little dirt on it just
to convince myself I'm on the team.

65
00:05:41,624 --> 00:05:44,024
- You'll get off the bench this year.
- I hope so.

66
00:05:44,227 --> 00:05:46,320
All the girls want football heroes.

67
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:49,987
I guess that's about all.
You can go to the party tonight.

68
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,258
And you can stay out till 10:00.

69
00:05:53,736 --> 00:05:57,263
Listen, you crybabies! You're not
gonna be so social this year.

70
00:05:57,473 --> 00:06:01,432
We're not running a mahjong society.
I want you all out for early practice.

71
00:06:01,644 --> 00:06:04,579
And don't forget,
this is just the beginning.

72
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,682
The first game's
just a week off. Okay.

73
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:10,412
Good going. You're in the pink.

74
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,987
- You'll be better than last year.
- Thanks, I owe it all to Poochie.

75
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,624
- I made him work.
- We'll win every game...

76
00:06:16,826 --> 00:06:19,021
...including against Colton.
- Don't say it.

77
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:23,130
Think it, but don't say it out loud!
The evil spirits don't like it.

78
00:06:23,332 --> 00:06:25,766
You're lucky you're
the best trainer here.

79
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,937
Tommy, you gotta stay away
from the women this year.

80
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:32,471
Remember, you're a football player,
not Rudolph Valentino.

81
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:37,169
Women won't interfere with how I play.
I can take them or leave them.

82
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,575
I wish another player
could say the same.

83
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:41,272
- Beef.
- Yes, sir?

84
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,146
- Where were you today?
- Right here on the field.

85
00:06:44,353 --> 00:06:48,449
Your delicate body may have been there,
but that dumb head of yours...

86
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,627
...was off worrying about
that flapper, Babe Doolittle.

87
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:55,423
You're right, coach. But I'll be
all right, I'm studying psychology.

88
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:58,691
Psychology! It's black magic.
Leave it alone.

89
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:02,997
It teaches you to act natural. You
shouldn't have repressed hostilities.

90
00:07:03,206 --> 00:07:06,266
If you got something inside,
you should let it come out.

91
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:09,104
So I want to announce right now...

92
00:07:09,312 --> 00:07:12,873
...if anyone comes near
Babe Doolittle, I'll kill him!

93
00:07:13,082 --> 00:07:16,313
- Wow! You tell 'em, Beef.
- That's love.

94
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:24,321
- Bobby, hurry up.
- Have you met the new bombshell yet?

95
00:07:24,894 --> 00:07:27,021
The Phi Gamma Gamma,
Patricia McClellan.

96
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,596
She's burning up the campus.
Haven't you seen her?

97
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:33,530
- I let the gals come to see me.
- Tommy, how do you do it?

98
00:07:33,736 --> 00:07:36,796
It's a cinch and it's a snap

99
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:39,634
They just fall in your lap

100
00:07:39,842 --> 00:07:43,505
And, Bobby, you can make them
Do the same

101
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,113
Who, me? Never.

102
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,514
Don't be scared, don't be shy

103
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,449
Get that gleam in your eye

104
00:07:52,655 --> 00:07:57,524
And then you'll have more girls
Than you can name

105
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:02,761
Wear collegiate, collegiate clothes

106
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:05,695
- Be a ladies' man
- I just look silly.

107
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,201
Get that swagger and get that pose

108
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,566
- Be a ladies' man
- I couldn't.

109
00:08:11,774 --> 00:08:15,301
If you think you're much too skinny
With your six-inch waist

110
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:18,537
Don't just give up the fight in haste

111
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,013
Some girls have such peculiar taste

112
00:08:22,218 --> 00:08:23,583
Be a ladies'

113
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:27,085
Be a ladies'
Learn to be a ladies' man

114
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,850
- And be collegiate
- Collegiate

115
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:31,287
- Collegiate
- Collegiate.

116
00:08:31,494 --> 00:08:35,055
Walk collegiate, talk collegiate

117
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,994
- Be a ladies' man
- A rooty tooty

118
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:41,568
Get that swagger, get that pose

119
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,864
- Be a ladies' man
- A rooty toot

120
00:08:44,073 --> 00:08:47,668
And when a ladies' man
Wears a certain tie

121
00:08:47,877 --> 00:08:50,937
And that twinkle is in his eye

122
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:53,581
You can kiss your sweetie-pie goodbye

123
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,910
They love a ladies' man

124
00:08:56,118 --> 00:09:00,646
- Oh, how I love the ladies
- Root toot-toot, rooty toot-toot-toot

125
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:03,290
Get that gleam, boy
Right in your eye

126
00:09:03,492 --> 00:09:07,223
- I wanna be a ladies' man
- A rooty tooty

127
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,763
Root toot-tooty, toot-toot-toot-toot

128
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,959
Be a ladies' man
A rooty tooty

129
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,900
When they give you that frozen stare

130
00:09:17,106 --> 00:09:20,166
Make believe that you just don't care

131
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:22,742
Then in no time they're in your hair

132
00:09:22,945 --> 00:09:24,412
If you're a ladies' man

133
00:09:24,614 --> 00:09:26,138
If you're a ladies' man

134
00:09:26,349 --> 00:09:29,512
If you're a ladies' man
You gotta be up-to-date

135
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:32,916
You gotta know your stuff
If you want to rate

136
00:09:33,122 --> 00:09:36,285
You gotta sing vo-do-de-o
and boop-boop-a-doop

137
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,689
You gotta ukelele lady
Lika she lika you

138
00:09:39,895 --> 00:09:43,160
You gotta do the Black Bottom
Gotta do the Shag

139
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:47,200
And the Charleston
And the Varsity Drag

140
00:09:50,706 --> 00:09:52,173
Oh, how I love the ladies

141
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:56,311
Wear collegiate, collegiate clothes

142
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,173
We're so collegiate

143
00:09:58,381 --> 00:09:59,712
Rather be a ladies'

144
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:01,314
Rather be a ladies'

145
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,680
Rather be a ladies' man

146
00:10:04,887 --> 00:10:06,115
Swagger!

147
00:10:06,455 --> 00:10:08,013
And strike a pose

148
00:10:08,224 --> 00:10:10,590
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be
Rooty toot-toot

149
00:10:10,793 --> 00:10:11,953
To be a ladies' man

150
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:15,824
If you're a football star
A big shot or an also-ran

151
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,092
A guy whose clothes don't fit him
Or a Dapper Dan

152
00:10:19,302 --> 00:10:22,203
Any man who is half a man

153
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:23,736
Has to be a ladies'

154
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:25,338
Gotta be a ladies'

155
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,940
Gonna be a ladies'

156
00:10:27,143 --> 00:10:28,542
Gotta be a ladies'

157
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:30,143
Hope to be a ladies'

158
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:31,711
Gotta be a ladies'

159
00:10:31,914 --> 00:10:34,883
- Gotta be a ladies' man
- The cat's pajamas

160
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:38,178
- Gotta be a ladies' man
- I'll pay you Tuesday

161
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:41,413
- Gotta be a ladies' man
- I really mean it

162
00:10:41,624 --> 00:10:43,524
Gotta be a ladies' man

163
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:48,129
And I don't mean maybe

164
00:10:48,331 --> 00:10:53,268
Got to be a ladies' man

165
00:11:00,644 --> 00:11:04,611
If I do more of this, I won't
have strength for the party.

166
00:11:04,938 --> 00:11:07,835
Why do you need strength?
Beef's curfew is 10.

167
00:11:08,188 --> 00:11:10,318
I'm through with football stars
whose curfews are 10.

168
00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:14,178
- My new passion is Bobby Turner.
- That skeleton?

169
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:17,271
He's about as appealing as
a string bean. He's nothing.

170
00:11:17,722 --> 00:11:20,204
Yeah, he's nothing.
He's on the scrub team.

171
00:11:20,394 --> 00:11:24,198
He can stay out all night.
Oh, I'm mad about him.

172
00:11:24,222 --> 00:11:26,681
- Does the lucky boy know about this?
- He will tonight.

173
00:11:26,716 --> 00:11:29,958
Of all the nerve, she can't do this!
Where's Connie?

174
00:11:29,993 --> 00:11:33,228
- Look at that thing. What is it?
- Pat McClellan's dress.

175
00:11:33,284 --> 00:11:34,707
- Oh, gee.
- Wow!

176
00:11:34,742 --> 00:11:37,072
She made me fix it.
I don't have to do that.

177
00:11:37,107 --> 00:11:39,589
- I'm gonna tell Connie.
- Come on, she's in the kitchen.

178
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,518
- Connie!
- Here I am.

179
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:46,119
- What's the trouble?
- It's that Pat McClellan.

180
00:11:46,322 --> 00:11:50,486
Connie, do you know what she asked me
to do? Sew some beads on her dress.

181
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,991
Who does she think she is, Marie
Antoinette? Give me a wrench, Cora.

182
00:11:55,197 --> 00:11:57,427
Maybe you can say something to her.

183
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:01,034
I don't know what I'd like to say.
Give me a rag, Cora.

184
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:04,673
- Here, let me look at that thing.
- Cora, give me a...

185
00:12:07,276 --> 00:12:08,971
Holy smoke!

186
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:11,544
Is this the dress?

187
00:12:11,747 --> 00:12:14,045
- What do you think of it?
- Isn't it the cat's?

188
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,549
Just out of the Ziegfeld Follies.
Where does it need fixing?

189
00:12:17,753 --> 00:12:20,415
- It doesn't anymore. I fixed it.
- You didn't.

190
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:23,091
I already did it before
I remembered to get mad.

191
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:24,884
I'd better have a talk with her.

192
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:26,755
- What about the sink?
- It's fixed.

193
00:12:26,962 --> 00:12:30,489
Don't have harsh words with her.
She's new and doesn't know.

194
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:35,636
You're right, Mrs. Drexel. After all,
she is just out of finishing school.

195
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:41,607
You wonderful creature!

196
00:12:42,478 --> 00:12:44,446
Why does everyone love you?

197
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:46,638
Why are you so divine...

198
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,579
...so clever, so popular?

199
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,152
I sure wish someone loved me
the way you love you.

200
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:00,692
Why, Connie Lane. I was only
fooling, n'est-ce pas?

201
00:13:00,896 --> 00:13:04,696
It sounded like true love to me.
Here's that burlap bag.

202
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,664
How sweet of you to bring it up.
Merci, merci.

203
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,362
As long as you're living with us,
there are a few things...

204
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:14,202
Why, of course. Naturally.

205
00:13:14,977 --> 00:13:19,209
That dress, for instance. For a little
sorority party, it's rather extreme.

206
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:22,384
- Extreme? Really?
- And obvious.

207
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:23,984
Obvious?

208
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,613
- It's Babe. Can we come in?
- Entrez.

209
00:13:26,822 --> 00:13:27,652
Sure.

210
00:13:27,856 --> 00:13:30,984
I hate to interrupt, but the sheiks
will be here any minute.

211
00:13:31,193 --> 00:13:35,391
- You'll slay them in that dress, Pat.
- They're all pretty impressionable.

212
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:37,532
- Have you met any of them?
- Not yet.

213
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,928
But I hope to meet all
the worthwhile ones.

214
00:13:40,135 --> 00:13:44,162
Well, let's see now. Which ones
are really, really worthwhile?

215
00:13:44,373 --> 00:13:49,310
Eddie Dunkelman. He's a catch.
His father's the local butcher.

216
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:53,914
He's a little short and a little fat,
but he does a mean Charleston.

217
00:13:54,116 --> 00:13:58,143
The boy for you is Tommy Marlowe.
We're all just crazy about him.

218
00:13:58,354 --> 00:13:59,651
Tommy Marlowe? Who's he?

219
00:13:59,855 --> 00:14:01,880
Only the captain of the football team.

220
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,251
And what a sheik.

221
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:07,657
You know, girls, I think college
contacts are terribly important.

222
00:14:07,863 --> 00:14:12,027
It's très nécessaire to find
someone of the right background...

223
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:14,031
...and sufficient wealth...

224
00:14:14,236 --> 00:14:15,362
...of culture.

225
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:17,038
Oh, that's so true.

226
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:20,367
Is 25 million dollars
enough culture for you?

227
00:14:20,576 --> 00:14:22,737
Peter Van Dyne, III has it.

228
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,810
Richest man at Tait.

229
00:14:25,014 --> 00:14:28,006
- Van Dyne, III?
- Oh, but he's such a drip.

230
00:14:28,217 --> 00:14:30,708
For 25 million dollars, let him drip.

231
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:32,648
He's not an attractive boy?

232
00:14:32,855 --> 00:14:36,689
Attractive? He's the twerpiest
wet smack of all time.

233
00:14:36,892 --> 00:14:37,950
Quel fromage.

234
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,220
- What did you say?
- I said, ''Quel fromage.''

235
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,230
- ''What a pity'' in French.
- Oh, you must mean dommage.

236
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:47,231
Fromage means cheese.

237
00:14:47,436 --> 00:14:50,803
Quel fromage. ''What cheese.''

238
00:14:51,006 --> 00:14:54,772
Oh, of course, dommage.
How silly of me.

239
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,467
Come on, they're here.

240
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:58,312
- Is Bobby here?
- I'm not ready!

241
00:14:58,514 --> 00:15:02,883
- You were saying about the dress?
- Oh, forget it Pat. I was wrong.

242
00:15:03,552 --> 00:15:05,850
The dress suits you perfectly.

243
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:17,261
Nice party, Mrs. Drexel. But I want
the team out of here by 10:00.

244
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:20,433
Of course, Mr. Pooch.
That's understood.

245
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:25,297
Gee, I love to dance. I feel like
I'm not even touching the floor.

246
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,940
You're not.

247
00:15:27,376 --> 00:15:30,709
It's heaven with you in my arms.
Let's go out on the porch.

248
00:15:30,913 --> 00:15:32,175
Let's dance.

249
00:15:32,381 --> 00:15:35,248
- Do you love somebody else?
- Oh, no, Beef.

250
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:39,945
You just don't understand me. I'm
like the psychology you talked about.

251
00:15:40,155 --> 00:15:41,782
I'm a split personality.

252
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,927
Oh. Well, if anyone comes near you,
they'll be a split personality.

253
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:55,063
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Oh, nothing.

254
00:15:55,437 --> 00:15:58,133
Beef, look at poor Connie.

255
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,638
You've simply gotta help her.

256
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:04,136
Connie?

257
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:06,780
Beef's dying to help.
Give him something to do.

258
00:16:06,982 --> 00:16:10,543
- Fine. Would you help me pass these?
- Sure.

259
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:22,420
- Well, Bobby, here I am.
- What?

260
00:16:22,631 --> 00:16:25,691
- It's time for that dance I promised.
- Go away!

261
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:30,395
- Beef will kill whoever comes near you.
- Well, wouldn't it be worth it?

262
00:16:34,343 --> 00:16:36,140
Hey, what's going on?

263
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:42,813
- Bobby, you and me are soul mates.
- What?

264
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:45,612
I won't take no for an answer.
Tell me you love me.

265
00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:47,618
Look at that. Goose pimples.

266
00:16:47,823 --> 00:16:50,451
Think it's cold? It's you.

267
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:53,890
Well, look at that. Goose pimples.
You think it's you?

268
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,996
It's Beef. Let me go!

269
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:59,993
There's nothing like
a college education.

270
00:17:01,637 --> 00:17:03,537
- Tommy, where've you been?
- Tommy!

271
00:17:03,739 --> 00:17:07,800
Girls, girls, where is this gorgeous
creature I've been hearing about?

272
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,910
Oh, McClellan isn't down yet.

273
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,546
Now, don't worry. I'll be back.

274
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:14,946
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi, Evelyn.

275
00:17:15,851 --> 00:17:17,512
What is this, the waiting room?

276
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:19,778
We can all go home now.
Marlowe is here.

277
00:17:19,988 --> 00:17:22,115
Thanks. This is quite a turnout.

278
00:17:22,324 --> 00:17:24,622
If this show's no good,
I want my money back.

279
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:27,557
I have a little
announcement to make...

280
00:17:27,763 --> 00:17:32,700
...you are about to witness Patricia
McClellan, the female form divine.

281
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:36,098
Jungle potentates have fought
for one smile from her lips.

282
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:40,867
For only 10 cents, you will see this
little lady descend these stairs...

283
00:17:41,076 --> 00:17:44,409
...placing one dainty foot before
the other. All right, watch...

284
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:54,854
Some of these boys you know, but I'd
like to introduce you to a few more.

285
00:17:55,057 --> 00:17:58,493
Patricia McClellan, Clyde Waters.
Richard Tripper...

286
00:17:58,694 --> 00:18:02,289
...Eddie Dunkelman...
- And I'm Tommy Marlowe.

287
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:04,891
That was a charming speech,
Mr. Marlowe.

288
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,365
You've obviously spent most of
your life in a freak show.

289
00:18:08,637 --> 00:18:11,162
I was only kidding.
You're really terrific.

290
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:13,170
I'll tell you more while we dance.

291
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,674
- Shall we go on, Mrs. Drexel?
- Oh, yes. This is Grover Smith.

292
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:19,541
- And this is Peter Van Dyne, III.
- Van Dyne.

293
00:18:20,048 --> 00:18:23,506
Mr. Van Dyne, III,
I've heard so much about you.

294
00:18:23,719 --> 00:18:27,177
I believe my mother might have
met your mother at Newport?

295
00:18:27,389 --> 00:18:28,822
Well, that's very possible.

296
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:31,822
- Would you care to dance?
- Oh, I'd love to.

297
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:35,027
Kind of cold in here, isn't it?

298
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:39,189
- How does it feel to get the brush?
- How do you like her, Tommy?

299
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:43,462
She's not so hot. Just trying to
play hard to get. Hey, Danny!

300
00:18:44,973 --> 00:18:47,874
You're the first touch of
refinement I've found here.

301
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:51,409
The first person I can really talk to.

302
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,114
That makes me very happy.

303
00:18:54,316 --> 00:18:56,750
I'd like to make you
100 million times happier.

304
00:18:56,952 --> 00:19:01,616
100 million! Oh, Peter!
You don't know what this means...

305
00:19:01,823 --> 00:19:04,758
My lord, would you and the duchess
like a moldy canapé?

306
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,949
Not very funny.

307
00:19:06,161 --> 00:19:08,857
I'll try one first,
in case you suspect poison.

308
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:12,090
- Not a bad idea.
- You're more at home in a freak show.

309
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:13,824
- You were saying...
- Van Dyne!

310
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,067
- Van Dyne.
- What is it?

311
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:18,262
Phone call, long distance. New York.

312
00:19:18,473 --> 00:19:21,169
- What? Where, inside?
- No, at the dormitory.

313
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:24,641
I'd better scoot.
Pat, I'll only be a few minutes.

314
00:19:24,846 --> 00:19:27,314
It'll seem like eons, my dear.

315
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:31,317
Oh, poor Peter.
I hope it isn't bad news.

316
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,081
Ten o'clock! Football team out of
here, pronto! Everybody out.

317
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:38,817
Isn't that your cue? You've got
something to do with football, right?

318
00:19:39,027 --> 00:19:41,928
Are you kidding?
Why, I'm the captain of the team.

319
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,361
I don't get this. What's the matter?
I'm a popular guy.

320
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:46,727
Really?

321
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,897
- This year I'll be all-American.
- All-American?

322
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,300
Does that mean you become a citizen?

323
00:19:52,507 --> 00:19:55,806
Come on, Pat. Don't be an iceberg.
You gotta melt someday.

324
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:59,845
Mr. Marlowe, haven't I made it
clear to you that I don't like you?

325
00:20:00,048 --> 00:20:04,178
I'll spin you into town tomorrow night.
Have dinner, go dancing, just us two.

326
00:20:04,386 --> 00:20:06,047
I'll pick you up at 6. Okay?

327
00:20:06,254 --> 00:20:08,051
- Quelle effronterie!
- Pat?

328
00:20:08,557 --> 00:20:10,047
- My dear.
- Peter, what is it?

329
00:20:10,258 --> 00:20:13,386
I phoned the dormitory.
There was no call for me at all.

330
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:14,425
No call?

331
00:20:14,629 --> 00:20:19,362
Well, I think I'd better be going.
Don't forget about tomorrow night.

332
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,570
- I'm glad you could stay, Peter.
- So am I.

333
00:20:27,776 --> 00:20:32,076
I knew when I came down those stairs,
this was going to be my lucky night.

334
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,804
It's like fate.

335
00:20:34,016 --> 00:20:36,883
It was accidental

336
00:20:37,085 --> 00:20:39,553
We just met by chance

337
00:20:40,222 --> 00:20:42,816
Yet I'm very certain

338
00:20:43,091 --> 00:20:46,891
You will be my big romance

339
00:20:47,763 --> 00:20:50,129
Football players bore me

340
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,096
All they've got is health

341
00:20:53,468 --> 00:20:55,959
But, you, my sweet

342
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,901
Are joy complete

343
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,966
Because you've got such wealth

344
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,806
Of culture

345
00:21:06,681 --> 00:21:09,411
Lucky in love

346
00:21:09,618 --> 00:21:12,587
Lucky in love

347
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:14,551
What else matters

348
00:21:14,756 --> 00:21:18,089
If you're lucky in love?

349
00:21:18,326 --> 00:21:20,760
Good breaks are few

350
00:21:21,163 --> 00:21:23,427
Few skies are blue

351
00:21:23,632 --> 00:21:25,964
But bad luck scattered

352
00:21:26,168 --> 00:21:29,069
When I first looked at you

353
00:21:29,838 --> 00:21:31,703
I don't care

354
00:21:31,907 --> 00:21:34,603
What the future will bring

355
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,802
If we're there together

356
00:21:38,013 --> 00:21:39,844
I won't need a thing

357
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:43,779
I'll say I'm lucky in love

358
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:46,644
If you'll take me, that'll make me

359
00:21:46,855 --> 00:21:50,848
Oh, so lucky in love

360
00:21:55,664 --> 00:21:58,155
Lucky in love

361
00:21:58,366 --> 00:22:01,130
Lucky in love

362
00:22:01,336 --> 00:22:03,998
Don't you know when you are

363
00:22:04,206 --> 00:22:06,731
Lucky in love?

364
00:22:06,942 --> 00:22:09,536
You're just my speed

365
00:22:09,744 --> 00:22:12,076
Why must I plead?

366
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,612
Oh, come to baby

367
00:22:14,816 --> 00:22:17,580
In her hour of need

368
00:22:18,453 --> 00:22:22,913
I don't care if you're puny and weak

369
00:22:23,325 --> 00:22:25,953
And you've only got

370
00:22:26,161 --> 00:22:28,561
Baby fuzz on your cheek

371
00:22:28,763 --> 00:22:29,752
I love you!

372
00:22:29,965 --> 00:22:32,627
Lucky in love

373
00:22:32,834 --> 00:22:35,325
If you trust me then we must be

374
00:22:35,537 --> 00:22:39,906
- Oh, so lucky in love
- In love

375
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,575
Lucky in love

376
00:22:41,776 --> 00:22:45,576
- You're lucky if you're lucky in love
- You're lucky

377
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,442
- Lucky in love
- You're lucky

378
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:49,912
Lucky in love

379
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,712
Lucky in love

380
00:22:52,921 --> 00:22:55,856
Lucky in love

381
00:22:56,057 --> 00:22:58,150
What else matters

382
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,954
If you're lucky in love?

383
00:23:01,163 --> 00:23:04,291
Good days are few

384
00:23:04,499 --> 00:23:06,729
Few skies are blue

385
00:23:06,935 --> 00:23:09,369
But bad luck scatters

386
00:23:09,571 --> 00:23:13,200
Every time I'm with you

387
00:23:13,942 --> 00:23:18,242
I don't mind if at poker, I'm green

388
00:23:18,446 --> 00:23:20,744
If I stand ace high

389
00:23:20,949 --> 00:23:23,474
With a beautiful queen

390
00:23:23,685 --> 00:23:27,280
I'll say I'm lucky in love

391
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,420
If you'll take me, that'll make me

392
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:33,685
Oh, so lucky

393
00:23:33,895 --> 00:23:36,193
So darn lucky

394
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:39,299
Lucky in love

395
00:23:39,534 --> 00:23:42,196
Lucky in love

396
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:45,064
Guess I never will be

397
00:23:45,273 --> 00:23:47,969
Lucky in love

398
00:23:48,243 --> 00:23:50,871
Some girls are gay

399
00:23:51,146 --> 00:23:53,637
Know what to say

400
00:23:53,848 --> 00:23:55,645
But when I talk

401
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:59,081
I scare the fellows away

402
00:23:59,888 --> 00:24:02,254
If my dream man

403
00:24:02,457 --> 00:24:05,085
Should ever arrive

404
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,056
I can bet he won't

405
00:24:08,263 --> 00:24:10,891
Even know I'm alive

406
00:24:11,499 --> 00:24:14,161
Lucky in love

407
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,130
Must be fun to be someone who's

408
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:20,866
Oh, so lucky in love

409
00:24:21,076 --> 00:24:23,408
In love, lucky in love

410
00:24:23,612 --> 00:24:25,443
You're lucky if you're lucky in love

411
00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:28,309
You're lucky in love
You're lucky in love

412
00:24:28,516 --> 00:24:31,485
So lucky, lucky, lucky
If you're lucky in love

413
00:24:31,686 --> 00:24:34,348
- You're lucky
- Got your head in a whirl

414
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:37,150
- You're lucky
- If you got the right girl

415
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:40,556
You're oh, so lucky

416
00:24:40,762 --> 00:24:42,821
Lucky in love

417
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,795
Lucky in love

418
00:24:46,635 --> 00:24:48,068
Up to now

419
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:51,797
I've been so lucky in love

420
00:24:52,274 --> 00:24:54,765
Never was spurned

421
00:24:55,143 --> 00:24:57,509
Never got burned

422
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,010
The cat's pajamas

423
00:25:00,215 --> 00:25:02,945
Where the girls were concerned

424
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,516
But now I'm acting

425
00:25:06,721 --> 00:25:08,746
Just like a dope

426
00:25:08,957 --> 00:25:12,552
It's the first time some baby said

427
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:13,955
''It's no soap.''

428
00:25:14,162 --> 00:25:15,288
And meant it!

429
00:25:15,497 --> 00:25:17,897
Lucky in love

430
00:25:18,466 --> 00:25:22,402
If you take me, that'll make...
- So it was you!

431
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,072
Of all the uncouth,
contemptible tricks!

432
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,468
I just wanted a chance
to get together.

433
00:25:27,676 --> 00:25:31,669
Get together? I never want
to see you again. You...

434
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,781
You're absolutely incorrigible!

435
00:25:35,917 --> 00:25:37,885
- What's that?
- That's French.

436
00:25:38,753 --> 00:25:40,778
Pal, that gal

437
00:25:40,989 --> 00:25:43,583
Sure put you in your place

438
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:47,592
When she called you incorrigible

439
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,229
To your face

440
00:25:49,431 --> 00:25:52,832
Oh, brother, you got a shove

441
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,997
And without that, we still doubt that

442
00:25:56,204 --> 00:25:59,332
You'd be lucky in love

443
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:02,374
In love, lucky in love

444
00:26:02,577 --> 00:26:06,877
You're lucky if you're lucky in love
You're lucky

445
00:26:07,582 --> 00:26:09,641
So lucky

446
00:26:10,385 --> 00:26:13,718
It's oh, so lovely

447
00:26:14,022 --> 00:26:16,149
If you are

448
00:26:16,358 --> 00:26:21,295
Lucky in love

449
00:26:38,813 --> 00:26:42,442
- These are what you're looking for.
- That's fine, Miss Lane. Thanks.

450
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:43,810
Good night.

451
00:26:55,997 --> 00:26:58,966
Why, Mr. Marlowe. What on earth
are you doing here?

452
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:01,863
Well, why? Can't anyone come in here?

453
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:06,368
I thought you'd made a mistake. It's
not the hangout for the football team.

454
00:27:06,574 --> 00:27:09,407
What do you mean? I've often
been here doing research.

455
00:27:09,611 --> 00:27:11,476
Not in the past three years.

456
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:12,805
Why do you say that?

457
00:27:13,014 --> 00:27:16,177
I work here, Mr. Marlowe.
I'm the assistant librarian.

458
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:20,286
In that case, I'll never lie again.
But how come you look so familiar?

459
00:27:20,488 --> 00:27:22,251
Where have I seen you before?

460
00:27:22,457 --> 00:27:25,620
You've seen me 100 times
in the past three years.

461
00:27:25,827 --> 00:27:28,660
You stood right next to me
at the punch bowl last night.

462
00:27:28,863 --> 00:27:30,228
My name is Connie Lane.

463
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:34,333
Babe's roommate! For crying out loud,
then you're a student.

464
00:27:34,535 --> 00:27:38,096
- Why do you want to work here?
- It helps pay my tuition.

465
00:27:38,306 --> 00:27:40,536
It's called working your way
through college.

466
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,266
Oh, I'm sorry.

467
00:27:43,111 --> 00:27:44,544
At your service.

468
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:47,647
Where's the French dictionary?
I want to look up a word.

469
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:50,113
I'm majoring in languages.
What's the word?

470
00:27:50,318 --> 00:27:53,287
Ever heard of a French word,
''in-courage-gee-bull''?

471
00:27:53,488 --> 00:27:56,719
- You mean incorrigible.
- What does it mean?

472
00:27:56,924 --> 00:27:58,551
Same thing it means in English.

473
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,129
''Impossible, incorrigible,
past reforming.''

474
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:04,730
That's what I thought.

475
00:28:04,932 --> 00:28:06,627
She spoke the word beautifully.

476
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,460
I heard it all the way in the kitchen.

477
00:28:09,671 --> 00:28:11,832
I'll give her back that parlez-vous.

478
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,065
- Who's the best French teacher?
- Kennyon.

479
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,503
I'll sign up for a course.

480
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:19,771
Don't get carried away. Kennyon is
tough, and he hates football players.

481
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:23,644
I've never flunked a subject yet.
Come on, show me a few words.

482
00:28:23,851 --> 00:28:27,343
- Don't be silly. It's closing time.
- Come on.

483
00:28:27,555 --> 00:28:29,352
Well, all right.

484
00:28:29,557 --> 00:28:32,651
- The book, le livre
- Le livre, the book

485
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:36,023
- The pen, la plume
- La plume, the pen

486
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,595
- La chaise
- La chaise

487
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,323
- Le crayon
- Le crayon

488
00:28:39,534 --> 00:28:40,899
- Le cahier
- Le cahier

489
00:28:41,102 --> 00:28:42,729
- Le papier
- Le papier

490
00:28:42,937 --> 00:28:46,168
Noir, rouge, blanc
are black, red, white

491
00:28:46,374 --> 00:28:49,241
- Rouge, blanc, noir
- You're fairly bright

492
00:28:49,444 --> 00:28:52,538
- Now please go back
- I bet I get them right

493
00:28:52,747 --> 00:28:56,080
Rouge, blanc, noir, le papier, le cahier
Le crayon, la chaise, la plume, le livre

494
00:28:56,284 --> 00:28:57,649
Le livre est rouge

495
00:28:57,852 --> 00:28:59,285
La chaise est noir

496
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:00,954
- Wonderful!
- This is work?

497
00:29:01,155 --> 00:29:02,452
It's more like play

498
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,818
In no time flat
Je parle français

499
00:29:05,026 --> 00:29:06,653
- Had enough?
- I'm just starting

500
00:29:06,861 --> 00:29:08,590
All right, you asked for it

501
00:29:08,796 --> 00:29:10,127
The door, la porte

502
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,764
La porte, the door

503
00:29:11,966 --> 00:29:13,433
Of wood, du bois

504
00:29:13,634 --> 00:29:14,999
Du bois, of wood

505
00:29:15,203 --> 00:29:16,602
To open, ouvrir

506
00:29:16,804 --> 00:29:18,203
Ouvrir, to open

507
00:29:18,406 --> 00:29:19,873
To shut, fermer

508
00:29:20,074 --> 00:29:21,507
Fermer, to shut

509
00:29:21,709 --> 00:29:24,735
The pronouns that you need
Are je and vous

510
00:29:24,946 --> 00:29:28,143
Je means me
and vous means you

511
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,407
Now do them all

512
00:29:29,617 --> 00:29:31,175
Just watch me plow right through

513
00:29:31,385 --> 00:29:35,116
Je and vous, to shut, fermer, to open
Ouvrir, la porte, rouge, blanc et noir

514
00:29:35,323 --> 00:29:37,791
Le papier, le cahier, le crayon
La chaise, la plume, le livre

515
00:29:37,992 --> 00:29:39,254
J'ouvre la porte

516
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,984
Je ferme la porte

517
00:29:41,195 --> 00:29:42,025
Marvelous!

518
00:29:42,263 --> 00:29:44,254
My thirst to learn you can't quench

519
00:29:44,465 --> 00:29:46,490
Come fill me up to here with French

520
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:47,531
- More?
- More

521
00:29:47,735 --> 00:29:49,259
- You'll explode
- Who cares?

522
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,732
The hand, la main

523
00:29:50,938 --> 00:29:52,303
La main, the hand

524
00:29:52,507 --> 00:29:53,804
The mouth, la bouche

525
00:29:54,008 --> 00:29:55,339
La bouche, the mouth

526
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:58,979
- Les yeux sont bleus
- They sure are blue

527
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,648
- Les cheveux
- The hair, les cheveux

528
00:30:01,849 --> 00:30:04,682
The words for boy and girl
Garçon et fille

529
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:08,014
Garçon et fille
Are he and she

530
00:30:08,222 --> 00:30:11,020
- Now from the top
- I'll get my French degree

531
00:30:11,225 --> 00:30:14,251
Garçon et fille, les cheveux, the hair
Les yeux sont bleus, la bouche, la main

532
00:30:14,462 --> 00:30:18,762
Je et vous, fermer, ouvrir, la porte
Rouge, blanc, noir, papier, cahier

533
00:30:18,966 --> 00:30:22,458
Le crayon, la chaise, la plume, le livre
Mesdames! Messieurs!

534
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:24,103
Les yeux sont bleus

535
00:30:24,305 --> 00:30:27,399
- You're crazy!
- Won't you come join me in a dance?

536
00:30:27,608 --> 00:30:30,634
I am the president of France!

537
00:30:33,381 --> 00:30:35,212
- Gee, this is fun.
- Yes, I know.

538
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,281
I didn't know learning could be fun.

539
00:30:37,485 --> 00:30:39,453
Look at these books
waiting to be read.

540
00:30:39,654 --> 00:30:43,146
- Anybody can come in and read them.
- Yeah, no cover charge.

541
00:30:43,357 --> 00:30:47,259
When I was a kid, I loved to read.
I wanted to find out about everything.

542
00:30:47,461 --> 00:30:50,021
I thought I was the only
kid who felt that way.

543
00:30:50,231 --> 00:30:51,289
You too?

544
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:54,059
I wanted to find out about
everybody in the world.

545
00:30:54,268 --> 00:30:56,964
Don't bother with that now.
Come on.

546
00:30:57,538 --> 00:31:00,564
There was a creek back home.
I used to take a canoe and...

547
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:03,710
...pretend that I was going to
the countries I'd read about.

548
00:31:03,911 --> 00:31:06,641
- Bread and butter.
- Bread and butter.

549
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:12,084
I was Huck Finn on the Mississippi,
the Volga, the Nile, the Seine...

550
00:31:12,286 --> 00:31:13,617
...all of them.

551
00:31:14,522 --> 00:31:18,959
Sometimes at night, I'd sit there
in my canoe and look up at the stars.

552
00:31:20,061 --> 00:31:22,859
I'd look up at them from our
rooftop in Chicago...

553
00:31:23,064 --> 00:31:27,398
...and think of all the people all over
the world looking up at the same stars.

554
00:31:27,602 --> 00:31:29,934
Thinking about them
in different languages.

555
00:31:32,406 --> 00:31:35,864
Now the whole world just seems
to be little Tait College.

556
00:31:36,077 --> 00:31:39,274
I never think about anything
but being a big football star.

557
00:31:40,114 --> 00:31:42,844
That'll be over in
a few months, and then what?

558
00:31:43,851 --> 00:31:47,685
If you don't forget about that boy
in the canoe, you'll be fine.

559
00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:50,084
I think he has a great future.

560
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:52,088
You're quite a girl.

561
00:31:52,293 --> 00:31:56,024
When I walked in here, I was
feeling kind of sorry for you.

562
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,424
Why?

563
00:31:58,165 --> 00:32:02,329
Oh, I don't know. Having to work
your way through school and...

564
00:32:02,536 --> 00:32:06,802
...missing a lot of good times.
Not having the best things in life.

565
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:10,967
The best things in life?
I've got them. Everybody has.

566
00:32:11,913 --> 00:32:15,542
There are so many kinds of riches

567
00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:19,879
And only one of them is gold

568
00:32:21,422 --> 00:32:24,118
The wealth you miss

569
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:27,023
Remember this

570
00:32:28,195 --> 00:32:30,993
Worthwhile things cannot

571
00:32:31,198 --> 00:32:34,759
Be bought or sold

572
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:41,235
The moon belongs

573
00:32:41,609 --> 00:32:44,237
To everyone

574
00:32:45,579 --> 00:32:49,538
The best things in life

575
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,685
Are free

576
00:32:53,688 --> 00:32:57,215
The stars belong

577
00:32:57,425 --> 00:33:00,258
To everyone

578
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,962
They gleam there

579
00:33:04,165 --> 00:33:07,999
For you and me

580
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:13,069
The flowers in spring

581
00:33:13,941 --> 00:33:17,069
The robins that sing

582
00:33:17,979 --> 00:33:21,642
The sunbeams that shine

583
00:33:22,149 --> 00:33:24,208
They're yours

584
00:33:25,052 --> 00:33:27,577
They're mine

585
00:33:28,556 --> 00:33:32,652
And love can come

586
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,929
To everyone

587
00:33:37,732 --> 00:33:42,192
The best things in life

588
00:33:43,004 --> 00:33:47,441
Are free

589
00:33:53,981 --> 00:33:56,074
Gee, I've learned a lot
of things today.

590
00:33:57,284 --> 00:34:02,085
La main, les yeux, la bouche.

591
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:08,455
- What does that mean in French?
- Embrasser.

592
00:34:08,662 --> 00:34:09,993
Embrasser?

593
00:34:16,037 --> 00:34:18,870
It's just as nice
in both languages, isn't it?

594
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:23,337
Gee, what a vocabulary I've got.

595
00:34:23,544 --> 00:34:26,308
Wait'll I spring this on Pat.
That'll put a dent in her.

596
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:30,283
Why don't you just hit her over
the head with a hockey stick?

597
00:34:36,457 --> 00:34:38,755
We'll review the use
of the French pronoun...

598
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:42,656
...for the benefit of those who
have come into the class late.

599
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:46,493
Il, he or it.

600
00:34:46,967 --> 00:34:50,403
Elle, she or it.

601
00:34:50,771 --> 00:34:54,730
Il est, he is.

602
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:58,467
Elle est, she is.

603
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:01,807
Ils, ''they,'' plural, masculine.

604
00:35:02,249 --> 00:35:05,616
- Are you sure he's in this class?
- They'll be out any minute now.

605
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,412
Pooch, you gotta do something.

606
00:35:07,621 --> 00:35:11,785
It's a downright case of French
schizophrenia if I ever saw one.

607
00:35:11,992 --> 00:35:13,823
Oh. Well, don't worry.

608
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:18,158
I'll see that he gets rid of all this
bologna. Just leave it to Poochie.

609
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:19,893
Je t'aime.

610
00:35:20,101 --> 00:35:23,832
- Je t'adore. Les yeux bleus...
- Good luck in the game tomorrow.

611
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:26,063
- The opening game!
- Oh, yeah.

612
00:35:26,273 --> 00:35:28,833
- Tomorrow, remember?
- It's a cinch. It's in the bag.

613
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,304
Je t'aime.

614
00:35:30,511 --> 00:35:32,376
It's in the bag, eh?

615
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:33,702
What's the matter?

616
00:35:33,914 --> 00:35:37,111
You and your French course.
That's what. You're gonna flunk it.

617
00:35:37,318 --> 00:35:38,683
Then where will our team be?

618
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,376
Aw, dry up, Poochie.

619
00:35:40,588 --> 00:35:44,786
Je t'aime, je t'adore,
les yeux bleus.

620
00:35:44,992 --> 00:35:45,959
What's that?

621
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,220
This is my French speech.
I'm springing it on a Sheba.

622
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,660
I get it. It's that McClellan dame.

623
00:35:51,866 --> 00:35:54,130
Tommy, have you gone nuts?

624
00:35:54,768 --> 00:35:55,792
Yes!

625
00:35:56,871 --> 00:36:00,705
The boys don't understand a word
you're saying on the field.

626
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:04,400
They're waiting for the signals.
You give them the signals in French!

627
00:36:04,612 --> 00:36:08,673
Sure. Quarante-et-un, dix-huit,
soixante-neuf, onze. Hup!

628
00:36:08,883 --> 00:36:11,408
I can't help it, Poochie.
Language comes easy to me.

629
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:14,816
I've been in the class five days,
and I speak like a native.

630
00:36:15,022 --> 00:36:18,389
- Not sure from where, but a native.
- Comes easy, huh?

631
00:36:18,592 --> 00:36:23,529
You think your parlez-vous français
will charm Crenshaw off the field?

632
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:27,962
I don't know, but it'll charm McClellan
into going to the prom with me.

633
00:36:28,169 --> 00:36:30,467
Poochie, vamoose.
I gotta study my speech.

634
00:36:30,671 --> 00:36:32,070
Hey, Tommy!

635
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,467
My chauffeur!

636
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:39,177
She's at Gimpeldinger's
having a soda with Van Dyne.

637
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,974
Keep the engine boiling.
I'll be right down.

638
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,414
Je t'adore, je t'aime.

639
00:36:48,622 --> 00:36:50,351
Vous êtes merveilleux.

640
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:56,061
- Pooch, can I drop you someplace?
- Yeah, over the nearest cliff.

641
00:36:56,263 --> 00:36:57,389
Anything wrong?

642
00:36:57,598 --> 00:37:00,863
Things are so wrong, we may
wind up using you on the team.

643
00:37:01,202 --> 00:37:02,829
Well, what's wrong with that?

644
00:37:03,037 --> 00:37:06,302
- Nothing, if you want to lose.
- Babe! Go away.

645
00:37:06,507 --> 00:37:08,941
- Is that all you have to say?
- Leave me alone!

646
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:12,237
- How long have you been here?
- I hopped in by the soda shop.

647
00:37:12,646 --> 00:37:16,377
I had an ice-cream cone and a glass
of milk. By now it's a malted.

648
00:37:16,584 --> 00:37:18,245
I'm trying to say I love you!

649
00:37:18,452 --> 00:37:21,546
I told you, I won't have
anything to do with you.

650
00:37:21,755 --> 00:37:24,724
I value my life. I love life,
and I want to live.

651
00:37:24,925 --> 00:37:28,383
Sure, I like you. If circumstances
were different, well...

652
00:37:28,596 --> 00:37:31,292
...you and me, that might be
how I'd like it to be...

653
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,995
To be or not to be,
that is the question...

654
00:37:35,202 --> 00:37:39,332
...where government of the people, for
the people, give me liberty or give...

655
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,168
- Oh, hello, Beef.
- Who are you talking to?

656
00:37:42,376 --> 00:37:46,073
- Nobody. I'm practicing a speech.
- I thought I saw you with someone.

657
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,373
- With somebody?
- Yeah, Babe.

658
00:37:48,582 --> 00:37:52,848
How silly. Just us two, just
jalopy and me and baby makes three.

659
00:37:53,053 --> 00:37:56,716
- You sure she wasn't here?
- Posi-lutely, abso-tively.

660
00:37:56,924 --> 00:37:59,859
- Turner, you don't like Babe, do you?
- Like her?

661
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,461
- Can't stand her, silly flapper.
- What do you mean, ''silly flapper''?

662
00:38:03,664 --> 00:38:07,623
She's great! She's the bee's knees,
the cat's meow and she loves you.

663
00:38:07,835 --> 00:38:09,700
- What'd you say?
- I said, ''Oh, yeah.

664
00:38:09,903 --> 00:38:11,234
She loves you. Yes, sir!''

665
00:38:11,438 --> 00:38:14,339
I'm glad you said that. Otherwise
I might've done this...

666
00:38:16,944 --> 00:38:19,504
- My fender!
- You know I get upset over Babe!

667
00:38:19,713 --> 00:38:23,547
I'm highly tense. When you keep
your inhibitions inside...

668
00:38:23,751 --> 00:38:25,651
...they just break open!

669
00:38:26,353 --> 00:38:29,049
I said, ''Ow!'' When you hurt
this car, it's hurting me.

670
00:38:29,256 --> 00:38:32,350
When I lose control, I get
shaken up from bottom to top!

671
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:36,222
- You don't know how I suffer!
- Beef, not so loud. My car!

672
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:40,264
- Oh, is this your car?
- It was.

673
00:38:40,467 --> 00:38:45,097
Sorry. When I get mad, I don't know
what I'm doing, like I'm hypnotized.

674
00:38:45,306 --> 00:38:47,331
Oh, that's all right.

675
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:50,635
- Give me a lift to Gimpeldinger's?
- Sure. Hop in.

676
00:38:50,844 --> 00:38:52,402
No, no, in front!

677
00:38:57,384 --> 00:39:00,911
Bobby, better take better care
of your car. It's getting shabby.

678
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:02,588
No, no, in front!

679
00:39:24,211 --> 00:39:26,839
All out for Gimpeldinger's!

680
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:43,362
Well, old place hasn't changed much.

681
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:47,631
Wonder if MclKinley's still president?

682
00:39:51,004 --> 00:39:52,665
Bonjour, mesdames et messieurs.

683
00:39:52,873 --> 00:39:57,037
J'ouvre la porte. Well!
Je ferme la porte.

684
00:39:57,244 --> 00:40:00,213
Garçon, un split de banane,
s'il vous plaît.

685
00:40:00,414 --> 00:40:01,438
Coming up, Tommy.

686
00:40:01,648 --> 00:40:03,013
Mes enfants...

687
00:40:03,217 --> 00:40:06,516
...le français, c'est le langage
de l'amour et de la guerre.

688
00:40:11,392 --> 00:40:14,828
I drink à la most beautiful
femme dans la chambre.

689
00:40:15,028 --> 00:40:17,553
Elle knows who elle is.

690
00:40:18,465 --> 00:40:19,693
Mademoiselle...

691
00:40:20,434 --> 00:40:21,992
Beat it, Marlowe.

692
00:40:22,536 --> 00:40:25,801
Mademoiselle, I have composed
a speech just for you...

693
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,133
...in your own language.

694
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:31,140
Je t'aime, je t'adore.
Les mains blanches, les yeux bleus...

695
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:35,076
...les oreilles petites, les dents
comme les perles, la bouche rouge.

696
00:40:35,282 --> 00:40:37,648
Mademoiselle, que vous êtes belle.
Que vous êtes délicieuse.

697
00:40:37,851 --> 00:40:42,413
Mon coeur s'ouvre à ta voix.
Le jour de gloire est arrivé.

698
00:40:42,623 --> 00:40:45,091
Therefore, mademoiselle,
after the game...

699
00:40:45,292 --> 00:40:47,886
...I'd be honored if you'd
accompany me to the prom.

700
00:40:48,095 --> 00:40:51,428
Mr. Marlowe, you are a pain
in the neck in any language.

701
00:40:51,632 --> 00:40:54,100
I'm going to the prom
with Mr. Van Dyne.

702
00:40:54,301 --> 00:40:59,102
You may be able to memorize lines,
but you can't memorize good manners.

703
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:03,505
Okay, Miss McClellan.

704
00:41:04,178 --> 00:41:08,205
Maybe it took a ton of bricks to fall
on me, but I guess I get the idea.

705
00:41:08,415 --> 00:41:09,712
You win.

706
00:41:10,684 --> 00:41:15,018
I won't take up any more
of your valuable time.

707
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:23,993
You keep treating Tommy like that
and he might lose the game for Tait.

708
00:41:24,898 --> 00:41:27,594
I'm afraid Mr. Marlowe's career
doesn't interest me.

709
00:41:27,801 --> 00:41:30,269
Watch this. I'll get her interested.

710
00:41:31,205 --> 00:41:33,765
Leave Pat alone, kids.

711
00:41:33,974 --> 00:41:37,774
Just because he's our hero, she
doesn't have to throw herself at him.

712
00:41:37,978 --> 00:41:39,639
And I don't blame her.

713
00:41:39,847 --> 00:41:44,614
After all, he'll be The Pickle King of
America after he's done with college.

714
00:41:45,219 --> 00:41:47,244
- The what?
- Oh, didn't you know?

715
00:41:47,454 --> 00:41:49,422
His father's the Marlowe Pickle Works.

716
00:41:49,623 --> 00:41:51,750
How sordid. Pickles.

717
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,587
Yeah, 30 million dollars' worth.

718
00:41:55,796 --> 00:41:57,889
Isn't it disgusting?

719
00:41:58,198 --> 00:42:01,292
And still, poor Tommy has no one
to go to the dance with.

720
00:42:01,502 --> 00:42:06,235
All that dough, most popular
guy in school, no date.

721
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,101
Maybe you're betting on
the wrong horse.

722
00:42:08,308 --> 00:42:11,368
- Mind your own business.
- Temper, temper.

723
00:42:11,578 --> 00:42:14,411
A medicine man I met

724
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:17,482
Said, ''Don't get yourself in a sweat''

725
00:42:17,684 --> 00:42:20,847
When things look gray
Just shrug and say

726
00:42:21,054 --> 00:42:23,545
''It must have been something I 'et'''

727
00:42:23,757 --> 00:42:26,555
''So don't get yourself
In a snit, ''he said

728
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,627
Tuck your tantrums
Into your kit instead

729
00:42:29,997 --> 00:42:32,898
''It's disarming to be charming''

730
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,432
Quoth the medicine man

731
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:38,503
Whom all agree, it's plain to see

732
00:42:38,705 --> 00:42:41,538
Nobody could be wiser than

733
00:42:41,742 --> 00:42:45,109
So if your temper's
Getting the top hand

734
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:47,780
All you have to do is just stop and

735
00:42:47,981 --> 00:42:50,449
Pass that peace pipe and
Bury that hatchet

736
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:55,554
Like the Choctaws, Chickasaws,
Chattahoochees, Chippewas do

737
00:42:56,857 --> 00:42:59,883
If you're feeling mad as a wet hen

738
00:43:00,093 --> 00:43:02,618
Mad as you can possibly get, then

739
00:43:02,829 --> 00:43:05,559
Pass that peace pipe and
Bury that tomahawk

740
00:43:05,766 --> 00:43:10,135
Like those Chichimecs,
Cherokees, Chapultepecs too

741
00:43:12,105 --> 00:43:14,733
When you're cranky

742
00:43:15,042 --> 00:43:17,772
Try to use a little restraint

743
00:43:17,978 --> 00:43:20,173
Fold that hanky

744
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:23,315
And wipe off all of that war paint

745
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:26,509
But if you wanna be an all-right guy

746
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,188
Not a long-face,
Blues-in-the-night guy

747
00:43:29,389 --> 00:43:32,153
Write that apology and dispatch it

748
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:35,089
When you've quarreled
It's grand to patch it

749
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,525
Pass that peace pipe and
Bury that hatchet

750
00:43:37,731 --> 00:43:40,825
Like the Choctaws, Chickasaws,
Chattahoochees, Chippewas

751
00:43:41,034 --> 00:43:43,969
And those Chichimecs,
Cherokees, Chapultepecs

752
00:43:44,171 --> 00:43:46,696
And those Chicutemis,
Chapechets and Chicapees

753
00:43:46,907 --> 00:43:50,502
Chochos, Changos, Chattanoogas,
Cheecharows do

754
00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:49,733
Chocho!

755
00:44:49,936 --> 00:44:50,868
Chango!

756
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,902
Chattanooga, Chippewa!

757
00:45:00,213 --> 00:45:01,043
Chow, chow!

758
00:45:01,248 --> 00:45:02,237
Choo, choo!

759
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:04,076
Chichimec, Chapultepec!

760
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,067
If you use a little control

761
00:45:26,273 --> 00:45:29,436
You'll be top man on the totem pole

762
00:46:44,417 --> 00:46:47,215
- Professor Kennyon!
- Oh, Miss Lane.

763
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:51,356
I was going to see you. I corrected
the tests, I'll give them to you now.

764
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:54,823
Thank you. Yes, the elementary
class. That was a fast job.

765
00:46:55,028 --> 00:46:56,188
- Oh, excuse me...
- Well!

766
00:46:56,396 --> 00:47:00,958
Gee, Connie! It's good to see you.
Oh, excuse me, professor.

767
00:47:01,168 --> 00:47:04,831
Watch your step in more ways than one.
I've got your first exam here.

768
00:47:05,038 --> 00:47:06,630
How did our football star do?

769
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,899
- A perfect paper. 100 percent.
- I did?

770
00:47:09,109 --> 00:47:13,045
I'm surprised. Don't get careless.
You've got to tow the mark with me.

771
00:47:13,246 --> 00:47:15,612
Football and studies don't mix.
Good day.

772
00:47:15,816 --> 00:47:17,613
He's a pleasant old cuss.

773
00:47:18,451 --> 00:47:21,682
Well, I've got to go
to football practice.

774
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:25,355
Gee, I got a perfect paper.

775
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:27,288
You know why? It's all your work.

776
00:47:27,494 --> 00:47:30,861
It's just a vocabulary test,
mostly words you taught me that day.

777
00:47:31,064 --> 00:47:32,361
Yes, I know.

778
00:47:33,867 --> 00:47:36,768
It isn't half as much fun
when Kennyon teaches it.

779
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:39,461
I never have the least
impulse to kiss him.

780
00:47:41,174 --> 00:47:44,075
Speaking of your impulses,
how about Pat McClellan?

781
00:47:44,277 --> 00:47:47,303
Are you making a dent on her
with your French?

782
00:47:47,747 --> 00:47:49,271
Oh, here, I'll take these.

783
00:47:49,482 --> 00:47:52,042
Guess I should have used
that hockey stick.

784
00:47:52,285 --> 00:47:55,652
It doesn't matter anymore. I knew
it the second I bumped into you.

785
00:47:55,856 --> 00:47:58,984
I don't care. I don't care
if I never see her again.

786
00:47:59,192 --> 00:48:01,251
Will you go to the prom with me?

787
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:03,019
After she declined?
No, thanks.

788
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:05,824
But I'm glad she did, because
now I can ask you.

789
00:48:06,032 --> 00:48:08,592
Play second fiddle? No, thanks.

790
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,130
Guess I don't blame you.

791
00:48:13,673 --> 00:48:17,507
- Well, who are you going to ask now?
- Nobody.

792
00:48:17,711 --> 00:48:20,009
I'm not going stag.
Guess I won't go at all.

793
00:48:20,213 --> 00:48:21,646
Not go to the prom?

794
00:48:21,848 --> 00:48:24,646
But that's silly! It'll
practically be in your honor.

795
00:48:24,851 --> 00:48:26,614
I'll go if you'll go with me.

796
00:48:28,154 --> 00:48:29,246
Well...

797
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:32,783
- All right.
- You will? Wonderful!

798
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,154
Eight o'clock.
I'm late for practice.

799
00:48:35,362 --> 00:48:37,227
Good luck in the game.

800
00:48:43,169 --> 00:48:45,262
Oh, they sure are blue.

801
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:55,743
Look at Connie.

802
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:58,140
Hi, Connie!

803
00:48:59,219 --> 00:49:00,846
She's acting so strange.

804
00:49:01,054 --> 00:49:02,749
Connie, hello!

805
00:49:05,292 --> 00:49:06,759
Hello...

806
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,932
So I told her if that's what she...

807
00:49:15,068 --> 00:49:16,365
Hello, Connie.

808
00:49:18,739 --> 00:49:20,172
Miss Connie!

809
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:24,640
- The sink, it's acting up again.
- It is? How nice.

810
00:49:24,845 --> 00:49:26,210
How do you like that?

811
00:49:26,413 --> 00:49:28,381
- She must've gone crazy.
- Overwork.

812
00:49:28,582 --> 00:49:32,780
She's having a breakdown,
poor kid. I gotta do something!

813
00:49:36,289 --> 00:49:38,621
Connie, are you all right?

814
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:42,426
- Babe, guess what?
- What?

815
00:49:42,629 --> 00:49:44,563
I'm going to the prom tomorrow.

816
00:49:44,765 --> 00:49:46,494
So that's it.

817
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,292
Wonderful! Who are you going with?

818
00:49:48,502 --> 00:49:51,164
- You'll never guess.
- Then you better tell me.

819
00:49:51,371 --> 00:49:54,340
Oh, I know it seems impossible, but...

820
00:49:54,541 --> 00:49:55,838
...he likes me.
- Who?

821
00:49:56,042 --> 00:49:56,974
Tommy.

822
00:49:57,177 --> 00:49:59,873
- Tommy Marlowe.
- Tommy!

823
00:50:01,381 --> 00:50:03,679
Connie, I think I ought
to warn you. Pat...

824
00:50:03,884 --> 00:50:06,648
Oh, Pat! He told me all about that.

825
00:50:06,853 --> 00:50:08,980
- It's all over.
- Are you sure?

826
00:50:09,189 --> 00:50:12,625
Oh, of course, I'm sure.
Don't spoil my fun, Babe.

827
00:50:12,826 --> 00:50:14,919
- What should I wear?
- A suit of armor.

828
00:50:17,831 --> 00:50:21,824
Just think, I'm going out
with a football hero.

829
00:50:31,077 --> 00:50:34,604
Yay, Marlowe! Come on, Marlowe!
Touchdown!

830
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:16,618
Tommy! Tommy!

831
00:51:35,041 --> 00:51:39,068
Oh, I was so thrilled! You made
a football fan out of me overnight.

832
00:51:39,279 --> 00:51:42,373
Oh, Tommy, I was
so mistaken about you.

833
00:51:43,083 --> 00:51:45,415
But today, when I saw you
on the field...

834
00:51:45,619 --> 00:51:48,713
...I suddenly realized
that maybe I was so rude to you...

835
00:51:48,922 --> 00:51:50,651
...because I really liked you.

836
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:53,485
But I didn't want to like you
as much as I could...

837
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:55,718
...if I really let myself.

838
00:51:55,929 --> 00:51:59,365
Pat, this is crazy. It's wonderful!
I don't know what to say.

839
00:51:59,566 --> 00:52:01,329
I know what to say.

840
00:52:02,535 --> 00:52:04,935
Can I go with you to the prom tonight?

841
00:52:05,505 --> 00:52:08,201
Can you? Oh, this is terrific!

842
00:52:08,408 --> 00:52:10,501
Wait a minute.
What about Van Dyne?

843
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:14,271
He just doesn't matter.
Poor Peter, he's really so stuffy.

844
00:52:14,481 --> 00:52:17,609
I should've known
the minute you saw me play a game.

845
00:52:18,618 --> 00:52:21,382
This is wonderful.
It's the greatest day of my life!

846
00:52:21,588 --> 00:52:24,216
I win the opening game and you
at the same time.

847
00:52:24,457 --> 00:52:25,446
Mademoiselle...

848
00:52:25,659 --> 00:52:28,719
...voulez-vous accompany moi
à la prom ce soir?

849
00:52:28,929 --> 00:52:30,692
Your French is beautiful.

850
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:33,263
Enchantée, monsieur, enchantée.

851
00:52:33,466 --> 00:52:34,899
See you tonight, then.

852
00:52:35,101 --> 00:52:36,125
Tonight.

853
00:52:40,106 --> 00:52:44,202
Connais-tu le pays?
Connais-tu, connais-tu? Con...

854
00:52:44,945 --> 00:52:46,242
Connie!

855
00:53:03,863 --> 00:53:05,728
372-J, please.

856
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:11,129
So I said, ''Herbert, if you think
I'm one of those red-hot mamas...

857
00:53:11,338 --> 00:53:13,704
...you're very badly mistaken.''

858
00:53:22,315 --> 00:53:23,976
372-J, please.

859
00:53:24,184 --> 00:53:25,481
That's right.

860
00:53:26,086 --> 00:53:28,247
I said, ''You may think
you're a sheik...

861
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,320
...but your harem has to
do without me.

862
00:53:30,523 --> 00:53:33,151
That is, unless you change your tune.''

863
00:53:42,736 --> 00:53:44,328
372-J, please.

864
00:53:44,687 --> 00:53:45,676
- Hey, Janet.
- Wait.

865
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:49,586
- Well, you certainly took long enough.
- It's all yours, June.

866
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:52,391
Georgia, look. I got an orchid!

867
00:53:52,595 --> 00:53:54,563
- Look, Joe sent me an orchid.
- Oh, boy!

868
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:56,664
My, that powder!

869
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:58,629
- Those from Bill?
- Aren't they pretty?

870
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:00,302
Beautiful.

871
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:02,835
I said, ''I don't think
the car's out of gas.

872
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:06,304
If you think I'm walking home,
you've got another guess coming.

873
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:08,977
I brought my roller skates.
And furthermore...''

874
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:13,240
Flo, for Pete's sakes! You've been
on that telephone for two hours.

875
00:54:13,449 --> 00:54:15,178
Oh, well, goodbye, Sally.

876
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:19,746
Who's taking me to the dance?
Well, who do you think? Herbert!

877
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,891
- How do I look?
- You don't look like a librarian.

878
00:54:25,094 --> 00:54:28,495
- I don't feel like one.
- Connie, telephone call for you.

879
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:31,792
Babe, I was working on
that step you were doing.

880
00:54:32,001 --> 00:54:35,061
- I know it starts like this...
- No, you're all wrong.

881
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:38,138
You throw your hip out like this.
Then you do...

882
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,878
Oh, that's cute like that.

883
00:54:43,379 --> 00:54:46,007
That's where that comes in.
Oh, I love that step.

884
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:48,150
Vamoose, Flo. See you later.

885
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:50,444
Okay, sure. See you later.

886
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,482
Don't tell me. I know.

887
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:56,815
He broke the date.
He's going with Pat.

888
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:00,726
Babe, I feel so awful.

889
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:02,898
Oh, Connie, don't cry. Please.

890
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,324
How could he do that?

891
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:08,470
Call up at the last minute?
He's horrible.

892
00:55:08,671 --> 00:55:09,968
He's just so dumb.

893
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:11,834
He is not dumb.

894
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:17,343
He got 100 percent
on his first French exam.

895
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:21,944
It's all my fault. I sicced her onto
him. I had to open my big mouth!

896
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:25,221
Gee, Connie, I didn't know
you liked him.

897
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:28,483
Fine friend I turned out to be.

898
00:55:28,691 --> 00:55:30,784
Oh, don't blame yourself.

899
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:34,293
He didn't have to change his mind
the minute she came running.

900
00:55:34,797 --> 00:55:36,924
Not if he didn't want to.

901
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,468
I guess he wanted to.

902
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,660
Hey, Babe, you ready?

903
00:55:42,538 --> 00:55:44,267
Connie, I'll stay here with you.

904
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:48,240
Oh, that's sweet,
but it wouldn't help either one of us.

905
00:55:48,444 --> 00:55:51,709
Well, there must be a way
of fixing this. I'll try.

906
00:55:51,914 --> 00:55:54,883
No, don't. Don't try to fix anything.

907
00:55:55,718 --> 00:55:57,686
I don't want him anymore.

908
00:55:58,655 --> 00:55:59,815
You have a good time.

909
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,923
Well, what'll you do?

910
00:56:02,225 --> 00:56:05,490
Oh, I'll read my favorite book...

911
00:56:06,462 --> 00:56:07,793
...Les Misérables.

912
00:56:11,567 --> 00:56:12,864
Have fun.

913
00:56:21,944 --> 00:56:23,172
Goodbye.

914
00:56:39,762 --> 00:56:44,699
I thought I'd found my ideal man

915
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:50,236
I always knew he'd arrive

916
00:56:50,973 --> 00:56:55,910
Though he's a true heart-appeal man

917
00:56:56,979 --> 00:57:01,916
He doesn't know I'm alive

918
00:57:02,885 --> 00:57:07,822
But I don't spend my time in grieving

919
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:13,495
I've learned the trick
Of make-believing

920
00:57:14,997 --> 00:57:19,934
So if I can't have my real man

921
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:26,308
There's only one way to thrive

922
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:35,877
Just imagine

923
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:42,147
That he loves me dearly

924
00:57:42,558 --> 00:57:47,018
Just imagine

925
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:52,031
That I'm his sincerely

926
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:56,638
I'm pretending

927
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:01,674
That he's sending

928
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:06,213
Love notes ending

929
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:10,477
''I love you''

930
00:58:12,188 --> 00:58:17,125
Seems that he's there

931
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:22,589
As the day is closing

932
00:58:22,899 --> 00:58:27,768
On his knees there

933
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:32,831
I hear him proposing

934
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:38,011
He's not present

935
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:43,585
Still it's pleasant

936
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:49,858
To just imagine

937
00:58:51,527 --> 00:58:56,464
That it's true

938
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:21,386
Come on, hurry up.
Break it up.

939
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:24,389
We want to see if we have
a game here Saturday.

940
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,523
Marlowe, Marlowe.

941
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:28,196
''D'' in English.

942
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:29,962
''D'' in history.

943
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:31,394
''D'' in physics.

944
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:33,694
''C'' in biology.
He never got those marks before.

945
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:37,566
He hasn't been studying. McClellan is
leading him around by the nose.

946
00:59:37,773 --> 00:59:40,742
- He just made it.
- Yeah? Where's the French marks?

947
00:59:40,943 --> 00:59:41,967
They're not posted yet.

948
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:45,045
I passed everything.
Guess I'll play in the game Saturday.

949
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:48,081
You're a genius. All we have to do
is worry about Tommy.

950
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:49,114
Where is he?

951
00:59:52,355 --> 00:59:54,721
Hey, Babe, you passed everything!

952
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:56,152
I did?

953
00:59:57,493 --> 01:00:00,621
Bobby! Bobby! I told you
last night I'd pass.

954
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:02,798
Hey, did you see him last night?

955
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:04,466
Here comes Tommy.

956
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,495
Well, kids, here I is.

957
01:00:07,069 --> 01:00:09,469
- Darling, it's ''here I am.''
- It's only slang.

958
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:11,367
I don't like you
to speak badly.

959
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:13,371
Okay, darling. Hi, coach.
Hi, Poochie.

960
01:00:13,576 --> 01:00:14,838
Hello, darling.

961
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:16,511
Well, do I play Saturday?

962
01:00:16,712 --> 01:00:19,408
- Yeah, you passed everything.
- But...

963
01:00:19,615 --> 01:00:22,106
- ''But''?
- The French marks aren't up yet.

964
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:25,151
You're not gonna worry about that.
My best subject.

965
01:00:25,354 --> 01:00:28,118
Saturday's my big day.
We'll mop up the field with Colton.

966
01:00:28,324 --> 01:00:30,155
- I hope so.
- And don't forget.

967
01:00:30,359 --> 01:00:32,520
Saturday's a big day
for another reason.

968
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:35,561
Don't you remember?

969
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:37,096
Oh, yeah, sure.

970
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,359
Well, shall we tell everybody?

971
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:41,532
Yes. Yes, why not?

972
01:00:41,737 --> 01:00:45,764
Listen, everybody. Saturday,
after Tommy wins the big game...

973
01:00:46,008 --> 01:00:47,839
Oh, you tell them, Tommy.

974
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:52,072
All I wanted to say, kids, was that...

975
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:54,841
...after the big game
with Colton Saturday...

976
01:00:57,653 --> 01:01:00,247
...Pat and I are gonna announce
our engagement.

977
01:01:13,135 --> 01:01:14,534
- Holy mackerel!
- What is it?

978
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:15,669
''F.''

979
01:01:17,673 --> 01:01:20,642
- They can't do this to me.
- Can't? They did.

980
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:22,868
Well, that's that.

981
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:25,138
''That's that''?
We've gotta do something.

982
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,407
You've gotta play that game Saturday.

983
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:29,346
I know. The dean!

984
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:06,048
Come in.

985
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:10,323
The dean and Professor Kennyon
have decided to give Marlowe...

986
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:12,926
...a re-examination in French
tomorrow afternoon.

987
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:14,391
How nice for him.

988
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:16,064
When can you start coaching him?

989
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:17,262
- Me?
- Sure.

990
01:02:17,466 --> 01:02:20,060
Yes, you.
Marlowe says you're the best.

991
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:23,568
Tell Mr. Marlowe I thank him for
the compliment, but I'm too busy.

992
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:25,240
Tell him to ask Miss McClellan.

993
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:27,932
- She says...
- I don't want them to bother you.

994
01:02:28,144 --> 01:02:30,874
Pat speaks French,
but she's not up on her grammar...

995
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,878
- Tell Mr. Marlowe, ''Quel fromage.''
- What?

996
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,745
I don't care what you think
about Marlowe...

997
01:02:36,952 --> 01:02:40,319
...but that game next Saturday
is a dead duck without him.

998
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:43,117
- I don't care whether he plays or not.
- You don't?

999
01:02:43,325 --> 01:02:44,690
You'd lose the game for us?

1000
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:48,386
You're building the foundations
of a lifetime guilt complex!

1001
01:02:48,597 --> 01:02:50,827
I know how you feel,
but you've no choice.

1002
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:54,161
- It's for dear old Tait.
- You gotta do something.

1003
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:57,537
All right, for dear old Tait.

1004
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:01,440
Tell Mr. Marlowe I'll meet him
at the sorority house at 8:00.

1005
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:03,111
In the kitchen.

1006
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:08,547
Gee, thanks, Connie.

1007
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:26,830
Now name the verbs that take
être instead of avoir.

1008
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:32,733
Aller, tomber, sortir...

1009
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:36,639
...partir, venir...

1010
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:38,279
I can't think of any more.

1011
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:42,315
That's hardly the right attitude.
You have an exam to pass.

1012
01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:43,450
Yeah, I know.

1013
01:03:43,652 --> 01:03:46,485
Kennyon is devoting his time
to giving you this chance.

1014
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:50,022
I'm giving up my time.
The least you can do is concentrate.

1015
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:53,093
I keep thinking of
so many other things.

1016
01:03:53,929 --> 01:03:56,591
Connie, won't you even talk to me?

1017
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:02,100
You were doing splendidly with those
verbs. Would you try them again?

1018
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:29,663
The moon belongs

1019
01:04:29,865 --> 01:04:33,460
To everyone

1020
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:39,608
The best things in life

1021
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:43,242
Are free

1022
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:49,948
The stars belong

1023
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:54,486
To everyone

1024
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:58,451
They gleam there

1025
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:03,530
For you and me

1026
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:12,099
The flowers in spring

1027
01:05:12,741 --> 01:05:17,201
The robins that sing

1028
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:23,447
The sunbeams that shine

1029
01:05:23,652 --> 01:05:25,847
They're yours

1030
01:05:26,488 --> 01:05:28,615
They're mine

1031
01:05:28,824 --> 01:05:31,588
And love

1032
01:05:33,062 --> 01:05:37,897
Can come to everyone

1033
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:44,769
The best things in life

1034
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:48,637
Are free

1035
01:05:51,513 --> 01:05:56,382
The flowers in spring

1036
01:05:57,386 --> 01:06:01,220
The robins that sing

1037
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:08,256
Let me say I'm sorry. You haven't
talked to me for two months.

1038
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:10,159
There's nothing to talk about.

1039
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:13,233
You'd better study,
because if you study, you'll play.

1040
01:06:13,435 --> 01:06:15,335
And if you play, you'll win.

1041
01:06:15,704 --> 01:06:19,265
When you win, you'll be engaged
to Pat. Isn't that what you want?

1042
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:20,908
Yeah, sure.

1043
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:23,578
That's what I want.

1044
01:06:23,946 --> 01:06:27,473
Finish that translation,
then we'll be through for the night.

1045
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:32,686
The best things in life

1046
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:38,490
The best things in life

1047
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:48,227
La lune, c'est à tout le monde

1048
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:55,910
On n'a pas besoin d'argent

1049
01:06:59,381 --> 01:07:04,318
Le ciel, c'est là pour tout le monde

1050
01:07:07,923 --> 01:07:12,860
On n'a pas besoin d'argent

1051
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:19,992
Les fleurs de printemps

1052
01:07:20,769 --> 01:07:24,466
Les oiseaux qui chantent

1053
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:28,271
Ces belles choses sont tout

1054
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:31,608
Pour moi

1055
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:33,213
Pour vous

1056
01:07:34,416 --> 01:07:37,681
And love can come

1057
01:07:38,087 --> 01:07:40,180
To everyone

1058
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:47,662
The best things in life

1059
01:07:49,932 --> 01:07:52,958
Are free

1060
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:00,140
How am I doing?

1061
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:02,574
Just a few little mistakes.

1062
01:08:02,778 --> 01:08:04,006
Mistakes.

1063
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:08,577
I've made one after the other, starting
with breaking that date with you.

1064
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:12,317
Oh, that was no mistake.
You got what you wanted.

1065
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:14,882
Yeah, I guess so.

1066
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:19,585
Gee, it's funny to think about
being engaged.

1067
01:08:20,662 --> 01:08:23,654
I wonder what it's like to be stuck
with one person for life.

1068
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:26,994
If it were the right one, you
wouldn't see yourself as stuck.

1069
01:08:27,202 --> 01:08:29,727
I didn't exactly mean ''stuck.''

1070
01:08:29,972 --> 01:08:31,303
I mean, well...

1071
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:36,239
Do you ever think about yourself after
college, settled down and married?

1072
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:41,246
Of course. I guess every girl has
a pretty good idea of what she wants.

1073
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:43,173
What do you want?

1074
01:08:44,486 --> 01:08:48,013
Oh, I guess I'd like to have
a family to bring up...

1075
01:08:48,223 --> 01:08:51,989
...and be able to go to concerts
and theaters, balcony seats...

1076
01:08:52,361 --> 01:08:55,421
...and have people over to the house,
a nice little house.

1077
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:57,030
A vine-covered cottage?

1078
01:08:57,232 --> 01:08:58,824
Or an apartment.

1079
01:08:59,568 --> 01:09:03,129
I guess the important thing is
finding the right fellow.

1080
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:07,834
It sounds pretty dull to you,
doesn't it?

1081
01:09:10,145 --> 01:09:11,476
No, it sounds wonderful.

1082
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:14,880
What do you want?

1083
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:16,142
Well, I guess I...

1084
01:09:16,351 --> 01:09:17,511
Hello.

1085
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:20,581
Just came in to see
how the lesson's going.

1086
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:22,450
The patient will live.

1087
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:26,025
I didn't know a French lesson
included singing love songs.

1088
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:28,228
You were listening.

1089
01:09:29,364 --> 01:09:33,630
I heard Tommy's voice, and I naturally
thought he was singing for me.

1090
01:09:34,169 --> 01:09:37,605
I need hardly remind you
that we're practically engaged.

1091
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:42,072
Making a play for a practically engaged
man is a very unladylike thing to do.

1092
01:09:42,277 --> 01:09:43,972
So is listening at keyholes.

1093
01:09:44,179 --> 01:09:45,544
Oh, don't worry, Pat.

1094
01:09:45,747 --> 01:09:48,648
Tommy will get all the answers right
because he loves you.

1095
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:50,648
Even if he didn't, I wouldn't want him.

1096
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:53,344
I wouldn't want him if he were
the last man here.

1097
01:09:53,555 --> 01:09:55,648
You picked the perfect mate
for yourself.

1098
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:59,726
He's inconsiderate, vain, selfish,
and you can't believe a word he says.

1099
01:09:59,928 --> 01:10:03,420
And the same goes for you. You deserve
to be stuck with each other.

1100
01:10:03,632 --> 01:10:07,363
Congratulations!
I know you'll both be very happy.

1101
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:13,999
I wonder where Connie is.
What's going on?

1102
01:10:17,012 --> 01:10:18,877
Well, do you want to correct it?

1103
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:21,982
Oh, he passed, all right.
It's almost silly to look.

1104
01:10:22,184 --> 01:10:23,776
Well, we'll see.

1105
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:28,183
- What is this? Some kind of a joke?
- What?

1106
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:31,257
Listen to this.
''Name the French verbs that take être.''

1107
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:34,156
Answer: ''Hit her over the head
with a hockey stick.''

1108
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:35,852
What?

1109
01:10:36,064 --> 01:10:38,464
''Give the French word
for 10 objects in the room.''

1110
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:41,602
Answer: ''The best things
in life are free.''

1111
01:10:41,803 --> 01:10:42,770
Go ahead.

1112
01:10:42,971 --> 01:10:47,169
''Write an essay in French describing
your home.'' He answered in English.

1113
01:10:47,376 --> 01:10:52,109
''A vine-covered apartment with people
on the balcony and 12 children.''

1114
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:54,675
- Oh, that's wonderful!
- Wonderful?

1115
01:10:55,884 --> 01:10:59,285
- Professor, do you know what this means?
- I certainly do not.

1116
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:01,854
- It means he loves me.
- What?

1117
01:11:02,124 --> 01:11:05,093
- He loves me.
- What are you talking about?

1118
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:09,622
He knows French. He could've passed,
but he wanted to flunk. Don't you see?

1119
01:11:09,831 --> 01:11:10,889
No, I don't see.

1120
01:11:11,099 --> 01:11:14,398
He didn't pass so he couldn't play,
so he wouldn't be engaged to Pat.

1121
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:17,970
He loves you so much he'd even
lose the game for the school?

1122
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:20,740
And I love him too.

1123
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:22,774
Just a minute, Connie.

1124
01:11:23,111 --> 01:11:25,511
You tell me this boy
really knows his French?

1125
01:11:25,714 --> 01:11:27,545
He knows it cold.

1126
01:11:27,749 --> 01:11:30,411
I've got to admire him.
He made a big sacrifice...

1127
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:34,851
...giving up something that must mean
a good deal to him, winning that game.

1128
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:37,389
It means a good deal
to the school too.

1129
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:38,457
I know, but...

1130
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:42,721
As you are aware, I'm not the school's
greatest football enthusiast...

1131
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:44,965
...but under the circumstances...

1132
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:47,192
...I think I ought to pass him.
- Pass him?

1133
01:11:47,402 --> 01:11:50,235
You'd feel guilty if he
didn't play in that game.

1134
01:11:50,439 --> 01:11:52,100
But if he wins, Pat's got him.

1135
01:11:52,307 --> 01:11:56,141
Work out your personal problems
without involving the whole school.

1136
01:11:56,345 --> 01:11:59,007
I'm afraid you'll have to find
some other way.

1137
01:12:03,785 --> 01:12:07,277
Well, I hate to say it,
but I guess you're right.

1138
01:12:08,123 --> 01:12:10,648
Well, I'll leave it up to you.

1139
01:12:11,426 --> 01:12:12,324
Shall I pass him?

1140
01:12:15,564 --> 01:12:18,032
- Hey, Connie!
- Did he pass?

1141
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,591
- Come on.
- Let us know!

1142
01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:17,168
Here she comes now.

1143
01:12:33,749 --> 01:12:36,547
After carefully considering
Mr. Marlowe's...

1144
01:12:36,752 --> 01:12:39,084
...unusual examination paper...

1145
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:42,382
...and being somewhat surprised...

1146
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:47,318
...at the rather remarkable answers
to some of the questions...

1147
01:12:47,796 --> 01:12:50,128
...Professor Kennyon
has decided that...

1148
01:12:50,933 --> 01:12:53,128
Well, he's interested...

1149
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:58,734
...and though he doesn't approve of
some of the phrasing used...

1150
01:12:58,941 --> 01:13:02,342
...he feels that Mr. Marlowe
has demonstrated...

1151
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:06,439
...a real feeling for the language.

1152
01:13:06,682 --> 01:13:07,671
Well, what is it?

1153
01:13:10,852 --> 01:13:11,841
He passed.

1154
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:16,719
Marlowe showed them
A thing or two

1155
01:13:17,192 --> 01:13:19,217
He's a ladies' man

1156
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:22,997
He's a ''wow''
With the parlez-vous

1157
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:25,758
So Marlowe
Big man on the campus

1158
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:28,098
Marlowe, it's all up to you

1159
01:13:28,637 --> 01:13:31,128
To come through!

1160
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:50,915
Number 16, pass.

1161
01:13:51,393 --> 01:13:52,485
Hike.

1162
01:14:31,266 --> 01:14:34,724
What does that lug Marlowe think
he's doing? Playing tiddlywinks?

1163
01:14:34,936 --> 01:14:37,029
He sure isn't
trying very hard to win.

1164
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:40,868
Trying to win?
He's the best man Colton has!

1165
01:14:41,376 --> 01:14:44,038
Isn't his little woman here
to spur him on to glory?

1166
01:14:44,246 --> 01:14:46,680
Pat's at the house
fixing her prom dress.

1167
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:49,544
I suppose she figures
the game's in the bag.

1168
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:06,190
Beef, are you hurt?

1169
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:12,101
Take a breath.

1170
01:15:12,307 --> 01:15:13,535
- That hurt?
- A little.

1171
01:15:13,742 --> 01:15:16,870
- Doc, how bad is it?
- Can't tell until we take an x-ray.

1172
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:18,512
Come over to the infirmary.

1173
01:15:18,714 --> 01:15:20,409
We'd better finish the game here.

1174
01:15:20,615 --> 01:15:23,880
- But I didn't...
- Take it easy. Save your strength.

1175
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:26,748
We may need you
for the Maypole dance next spring.

1176
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:28,081
You're all invited.

1177
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:30,656
That's right, laugh.
Enjoy yourselves.

1178
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:34,556
Popcorn! Cracker Jacks!
Champagne for everyone!

1179
01:15:34,763 --> 01:15:35,991
All right!

1180
01:15:36,465 --> 01:15:40,060
You thought I'd come in here and bawl
the living daylights out of you.

1181
01:15:40,268 --> 01:15:43,829
Scream. Rant! Lose my mind!

1182
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:48,741
But nothing like that's gonna happen.
I'm perfectly calm.

1183
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:51,742
I'm not gonna let
a little old football game upset me!

1184
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:52,777
Take it easy.

1185
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:56,610
I could tell you what you've
done wrong, but you know what you did.

1186
01:15:56,818 --> 01:15:59,685
Zubrowski, that end run.

1187
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:02,186
Hepple! Hepple, where were you?

1188
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:05,588
Sternsdorf, offside three times.

1189
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:07,455
Fifteen yards!

1190
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:09,327
Thompson.

1191
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:12,757
Thompson, haven't you heard?

1192
01:16:12,968 --> 01:16:16,062
The forward pass has been legal
for 15 years.

1193
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:18,705
Okay! What's the use?

1194
01:16:19,274 --> 01:16:23,142
Of course, I know the one thing
that's really wrong.

1195
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:26,143
Marlowe, you're not playing at all.

1196
01:16:26,481 --> 01:16:29,450
If you'd get in there and play,
they'd all play with you.

1197
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:32,586
- What's eating you, Tommy?
- Nothing. I'm all right.

1198
01:16:32,788 --> 01:16:34,050
''All right''?

1199
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:38,056
You're so all right, you'll spend
the rest of the game on the bench.

1200
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:39,420
That's final!

1201
01:16:39,628 --> 01:16:41,220
All right. Ha!

1202
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:44,593
If you're all right, then I'm crazy.
I'll prove it to you.

1203
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,700
Turner, come here.

1204
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:47,766
Me, sir?

1205
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:50,736
Our two best players are
out of the game.

1206
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:54,841
So I thought it'd be an interesting
form of suicide to put you in.

1207
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:57,275
Gee, that's great, coach.

1208
01:16:57,479 --> 01:16:59,640
I'll kill them. I'll kill them!

1209
01:16:59,848 --> 01:17:02,112
I'll tear them apart. I'll show them.

1210
01:17:02,317 --> 01:17:04,979
For dear old Tait, I'll do or die!

1211
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:08,020
What spirit! Look at that.
There's inspiration for you.

1212
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:12,421
New blood in the game. That good old
Tait spirit. And no one can beat it.

1213
01:17:12,627 --> 01:17:14,595
You won't let all those people down.

1214
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:16,696
Not all those people out there!

1215
01:17:16,898 --> 01:17:20,231
Not all those little old ladies
who sweep up the stadium.

1216
01:17:20,435 --> 01:17:21,333
I mean...

1217
01:17:21,536 --> 01:17:23,436
That's it! Bobby!

1218
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:25,866
Bobby, my boy.

1219
01:17:26,274 --> 01:17:31,041
Fellas, get up off your benches
and get in there and fight!

1220
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:36,613
I wish I had a broken rib.

1221
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:39,787
You shouldn't say that.
You still got a chance to win.

1222
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:40,955
Win what? The game?

1223
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:44,455
And Pat too. Don't you want to
announce your engagement to her?

1224
01:17:44,793 --> 01:17:46,784
Not when I'm in love with Connie.

1225
01:17:50,732 --> 01:17:51,562
Connie?!

1226
01:17:58,840 --> 01:17:59,670
Connie!

1227
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:02,002
Beef! Here we are.

1228
01:18:02,410 --> 01:18:04,105
- You all right?
- I'll be x-rayed.

1229
01:18:04,312 --> 01:18:05,404
Down in front.

1230
01:18:05,614 --> 01:18:08,606
You can't just sit here.
Tommy's losing the game!

1231
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:09,909
What can I do?

1232
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:13,485
He said if he wins, he gets
the wrong girl because he loves you!

1233
01:18:13,688 --> 01:18:14,882
Aw, sit down!

1234
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:16,785
You mean Tommy really loves Connie?

1235
01:18:16,992 --> 01:18:19,256
Yeah, and she's gotta
give him a pep talk.

1236
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:21,554
But if I do, then I lose him forever.

1237
01:18:21,763 --> 01:18:24,061
Holy smoke! You mean it's true?

1238
01:18:24,266 --> 01:18:28,134
Then we gotta do something.
You love him. He loves you.

1239
01:18:28,336 --> 01:18:30,304
We gotta get rid of Pat.

1240
01:18:30,739 --> 01:18:34,072
Why did I ever tell her
Tommy was the Pickle King?

1241
01:18:34,276 --> 01:18:35,709
Pickle King?

1242
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:39,641
Have you got your
brother-in-law's car?

1243
01:18:39,848 --> 01:18:42,476
- Sure. Have you seen it?
- No, but I'd love to.

1244
01:18:42,684 --> 01:18:44,618
- We're going.
- You gonna talk to Tommy?

1245
01:18:44,819 --> 01:18:46,946
I'm going to the house.
See you later.

1246
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:49,623
- But my x-rays.
- Yes!

1247
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:52,553
Faster.

1248
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:53,750
I don't understand.

1249
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:56,760
Oh, please, Beef,
I've got to concentrate.

1250
01:19:03,138 --> 01:19:04,867
There. You wait here, Beef.

1251
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:07,837
If someone comes out before I do,
give her a lift.

1252
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:11,171
- All right, but I don't understand.
- You will.

1253
01:19:13,815 --> 01:19:15,510
I'm glad you're back.
The sink...

1254
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:17,776
Never mind that.
You've got to help me.

1255
01:19:17,986 --> 01:19:20,318
- Have you ever acted in a play?
- What?

1256
01:19:20,522 --> 01:19:22,922
I mean, have you ever
recited lines like...

1257
01:19:23,124 --> 01:19:25,854
...Sarah Bernhardt or Ethel Barrymore?
You know.

1258
01:19:26,061 --> 01:19:28,256
- You mean play-acting?
- Yes. Come on.

1259
01:19:28,463 --> 01:19:32,593
Wait a minute. I've written it all
down. Don't talk till you get there.

1260
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:41,809
Oh, Cora! I'm so unhappy!

1261
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:45,045
Oh, Cora, I had to come back
from the game.

1262
01:19:45,246 --> 01:19:48,147
I couldn't stand it anymore.
It's so awful.

1263
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:49,339
We're winning!

1264
01:19:49,684 --> 01:19:52,915
Tommy is piling up
touchdown after touchdown.

1265
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:57,421
And by tonight, he'll be engaged
to that awful Pat McClellan.

1266
01:19:57,859 --> 01:19:59,554
I hate her!

1267
01:20:01,396 --> 01:20:05,127
''Now, now, Miss Connie,
you better forget all about it.

1268
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:08,029
He loves her and that's all
there is to it.''

1269
01:20:08,236 --> 01:20:11,399
''Oh, I can't stand it!
She's got him for life.''

1270
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:13,233
''Does she love him?''

1271
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:15,602
''Oh, I suppose she does.

1272
01:20:15,810 --> 01:20:19,803
After all, she stuck by him,
even through what just happened.''

1273
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:21,505
''Through what just happened?''

1274
01:20:21,716 --> 01:20:22,910
''Haven't you heard?

1275
01:20:23,118 --> 01:20:26,417
Tommy's father, the Pickle King,
he's gone bankrupt.''

1276
01:20:27,722 --> 01:20:28,620
''Really?''

1277
01:20:28,823 --> 01:20:32,054
''Yes. A terrible cucumber blight
in Iowa.

1278
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:36,094
He's a ruined man.
Tommy is penniless!''

1279
01:20:38,299 --> 01:20:39,231
''No!''

1280
01:20:39,434 --> 01:20:41,425
''Well, I guess Pat won't mind.

1281
01:20:41,636 --> 01:20:45,299
She'll be glad to scrimp and scrub
and save and sew...

1282
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:47,737
...because she'll have him.
After all...

1283
01:20:47,942 --> 01:20:51,241
...when you have love,
money doesn't really matter.

1284
01:20:51,446 --> 01:20:52,743
Does it, Cora?''

1285
01:20:53,548 --> 01:20:56,449
''Does it, Cora?'' I mean, I mean...

1286
01:20:56,651 --> 01:21:00,087
''She could clear 15...

1287
01:21:00,288 --> 01:21:02,848
...or 20 taking in washing.''

1288
01:21:03,058 --> 01:21:05,618
''Oh, but she has such pretty hands.''

1289
01:21:06,795 --> 01:21:09,821
''Oh, well, it's her problem now.''

1290
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:14,792
''Poor child. Why don't you go back
to the game?''

1291
01:21:15,003 --> 01:21:17,164
''No, I can't watch anymore.

1292
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:20,239
Beef drove me over. He's outside now.

1293
01:21:20,442 --> 01:21:24,208
He's been paying a lot of attention
to me ever since...

1294
01:21:26,081 --> 01:21:28,641
...Babe gave him back
his fraternity pin.

1295
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:30,977
But I guess I love Tommy too much.''

1296
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:35,514
''Beef is a very fine fellow, no.''

1297
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:37,783
''Oh, a girl could do worse.

1298
01:21:37,992 --> 01:21:41,484
Just think, he's one of
the richest boys at Tait.

1299
01:21:41,696 --> 01:21:43,527
Dairy products, you know.

1300
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:45,359
Worth millions!

1301
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:48,692
Have you seen that new car of his?''

1302
01:21:48,937 --> 01:21:53,271
''Oh, my, it is a wow. Yes.''

1303
01:21:53,475 --> 01:21:55,204
''Just think. Such a catch...

1304
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:57,275
...and completely unattached.

1305
01:21:57,479 --> 01:22:02,007
Maybe I'd better hold on to him
before someone else gets there.''

1306
01:22:05,186 --> 01:22:07,711
- Was it all right?
- Marvelous!

1307
01:22:21,803 --> 01:22:24,465
Gee, why must everyone
get literary in my car?

1308
01:22:24,672 --> 01:22:27,334
Please forgive me, Beef.
This is very important.

1309
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:29,634
You will forgive me, won't you?

1310
01:22:30,211 --> 01:22:32,736
Gee, I'd forgive you anything.

1311
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:37,717
Ready. Hike!

1312
01:23:08,983 --> 01:23:11,008
Hey, Tommy, I've got
something for you.

1313
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:19,558
''Can't stand in the way of true love.

1314
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:23,060
Make big sacrifice.
Give you up. Pat.''

1315
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:27,291
Hey, Beef! This is it!
Hey! Thanks.

1316
01:23:28,002 --> 01:23:29,970
Coach! I'm all right now.
May I go in?

1317
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:31,695
Marlowe, I can't figure it.

1318
01:23:31,906 --> 01:23:34,204
We got three minutes. Go ahead.

1319
01:23:43,084 --> 01:23:44,711
All right, 32 is our only chance.

1320
01:23:44,919 --> 01:23:47,183
Bobby, you know the play?
Okay, hike.

1321
01:24:16,284 --> 01:24:19,481
Tommy, we've been looking for you.
Where have you been?

1322
01:24:23,591 --> 01:24:26,583
Wait a minute. Wait.
Has anyone seen Connie?

1323
01:24:26,861 --> 01:24:28,453
I've gotta go.

1324
01:24:29,931 --> 01:24:32,991
So we're on the 40-yard line,
and I've got the ball.

1325
01:24:33,201 --> 01:24:34,327
So I turn around...

1326
01:24:34,535 --> 01:24:36,662
I got squatter's rights!

1327
01:24:36,871 --> 01:24:38,702
All right, break it up, girls.

1328
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:41,205
Come here, woman, and kiss me.

1329
01:24:46,381 --> 01:24:48,508
Where's Beef?
I'm not afraid of him.

1330
01:24:48,716 --> 01:24:50,081
Hey, Beef! Are you looking?

1331
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:56,721
Gee, I used to think I had
a mother fixation.

1332
01:24:57,358 --> 01:24:59,292
You're not a bit like her.

1333
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:01,422
I like you better.

1334
01:25:01,629 --> 01:25:03,893
Beefy, you're a panic.

1335
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:07,391
- Do you think he's here?
- Of course he is.

1336
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:09,331
I can't understand why he didn't call.

1337
01:25:09,537 --> 01:25:11,869
He still thinks
that you don't like him.

1338
01:25:12,073 --> 01:25:15,236
After five minutes,
you'll be in each others' arms.

1339
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:17,707
- Really?
- Check, please.

1340
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:19,538
Oh, Van Dyne.

1341
01:25:19,747 --> 01:25:22,272
Would you take Miss Lane inside?
I left my pipe.

1342
01:25:22,483 --> 01:25:25,543
- I'd be delighted.
- Thank you, Peter.

1343
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:36,590
You just look adorable tonight.

1344
01:25:36,798 --> 01:25:38,060
Why, Peter.

1345
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:41,031
Van Dyne!

1346
01:25:41,235 --> 01:25:43,760
Who'd you expect her to come with,
Professor Kennyon?

1347
01:25:44,105 --> 01:25:47,074
I don't know what to expect.
I'm going home.

1348
01:25:59,687 --> 01:26:01,018
- Marlowe.
- Yes, sir?

1349
01:26:01,222 --> 01:26:03,417
- Where are you rushing off to?
- I'm going home.

1350
01:26:03,624 --> 01:26:05,421
- Isn't it a bit early?
- Yes, sir.

1351
01:26:05,626 --> 01:26:09,392
Don't leave so soon. I think there's
someone inside looking for you.

1352
01:26:09,731 --> 01:26:12,063
- Who?
- Connie Lane, to be exact.

1353
01:26:12,266 --> 01:26:14,291
She can't stand the sight of me.

1354
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:15,867
So you're going home?

1355
01:26:16,537 --> 01:26:17,868
You're just leaving?

1356
01:26:18,072 --> 01:26:20,540
Slinking away like Napoleon
from Waterloo.

1357
01:26:20,742 --> 01:26:22,232
Did you speak to her?

1358
01:26:22,443 --> 01:26:24,001
You didn't even speak to her?

1359
01:26:24,212 --> 01:26:25,907
What's the matter with you?

1360
01:26:26,114 --> 01:26:29,641
You don't do this in football.
In a losing battle, you try harder!

1361
01:26:29,851 --> 01:26:32,979
Don't give up. How do you
know she doesn't love you?

1362
01:26:33,788 --> 01:26:36,814
What is it your coach says?
You've got to?

1363
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:40,392
- Get in there...
- Yes! Get in there and fight.

1364
01:26:40,595 --> 01:26:41,994
Good luck.

1365
01:26:49,837 --> 01:26:50,826
Connie!

1366
01:26:54,909 --> 01:26:55,898
Connie?

1367
01:26:57,311 --> 01:27:00,178
Oh, it's you. I thought you'd left.

1368
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:01,575
How'd you know?

1369
01:27:01,783 --> 01:27:03,273
Somebody told me.

1370
01:27:03,484 --> 01:27:05,611
Well, I almost left.

1371
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:07,578
What stopped you?

1372
01:27:07,789 --> 01:27:10,087
Nothing stopped me, I'm leaving now.

1373
01:27:12,593 --> 01:27:14,356
Where are you going?

1374
01:27:14,562 --> 01:27:17,998
Where am I going? I'm going home!
Where do people generally go?

1375
01:27:18,199 --> 01:27:19,564
Home.

1376
01:27:20,868 --> 01:27:22,267
You staying?

1377
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:25,132
Oh, yes. I'm having a lovely time.

1378
01:27:26,207 --> 01:27:28,198
Why don't you go back inside?

1379
01:27:28,843 --> 01:27:30,777
I like it out here.

1380
01:27:31,345 --> 01:27:34,143
I think it's utterly
delightful out here.

1381
01:27:34,582 --> 01:27:39,178
And besides, no one's gonna tell me
where to go! Why don't you go inside?

1382
01:27:39,387 --> 01:27:41,355
I'm leaving.
I don't have to go inside.

1383
01:27:41,556 --> 01:27:42,784
Then why don't you leave?

1384
01:27:42,990 --> 01:27:44,287
Because I love you!

1385
01:27:46,794 --> 01:27:48,489
That's a ridiculous thing to say.

1386
01:27:48,696 --> 01:27:50,254
Well, I said it.

1387
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:52,524
- I'm glad.
- What?

1388
01:27:52,733 --> 01:27:54,598
I'm glad!

1389
01:27:54,802 --> 01:27:56,793
- Oh, you are?
- Yes.

1390
01:27:57,038 --> 01:27:59,472
In that case, I've got a lot
of things to say.

1391
01:27:59,674 --> 01:28:00,572
For instance?

1392
01:28:00,775 --> 01:28:03,608
Remember the day when you
gave me the French lesson?

1393
01:28:03,811 --> 01:28:06,006
There are a lot of things
you could teach me...

1394
01:28:06,214 --> 01:28:08,079
...and that's the way I want it to be.

1395
01:28:08,282 --> 01:28:11,012
You name it.
I'll do anything you say.

1396
01:28:11,219 --> 01:28:13,346
- Anything?
- Try me.

1397
01:28:15,089 --> 01:28:16,886
Down on your heels.

1398
01:28:17,358 --> 01:28:18,586
Down on my heels?

1399
01:28:18,793 --> 01:28:20,351
Up on your toes.

1400
01:28:20,561 --> 01:28:23,223
Up on my toes? What's that?

1401
01:28:23,431 --> 01:28:26,889
That's the way to do the Varsity Drag

1402
01:28:29,036 --> 01:28:30,867
We've always thought
Knowledge is naught

1403
01:28:31,072 --> 01:28:32,562
We should be taught

1404
01:28:32,773 --> 01:28:34,331
To dance

1405
01:28:34,542 --> 01:28:36,271
Right here at Tait
We're up-to-date

1406
01:28:36,477 --> 01:28:37,944
We teach a great

1407
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:39,636
New dance

1408
01:28:39,847 --> 01:28:42,281
Don't think that I brag

1409
01:28:42,483 --> 01:28:44,917
I speak of the Drag

1410
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:46,916
Why should a sheik
Learn how to speak

1411
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:48,622
Latin and Greek

1412
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:50,290
Badly?

1413
01:28:50,491 --> 01:28:52,186
Give him a neat
Motto complete

1414
01:28:52,393 --> 01:28:55,453
Say it with feet
Gladly

1415
01:28:55,663 --> 01:28:58,257
First lesson right now

1416
01:28:58,466 --> 01:29:00,866
You'll love it
And how you'll love it

1417
01:29:01,068 --> 01:29:03,536
Here is the Drag
See how it goes

1418
01:29:03,738 --> 01:29:06,206
Down on your heels
Up on your toes

1419
01:29:06,407 --> 01:29:10,537
That's the way to do the Varsity Drag

1420
01:29:11,445 --> 01:29:13,913
Hotter than hot
Newer than new

1421
01:29:14,115 --> 01:29:16,515
Meaner than mean
Bluer than blue

1422
01:29:16,717 --> 01:29:21,086
Gets as much applause
As waving the flag

1423
01:29:21,989 --> 01:29:24,287
You can pass many a class

1424
01:29:24,492 --> 01:29:26,983
Whether you're dumb or wise

1425
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:29,459
If you all answer the call

1426
01:29:29,664 --> 01:29:31,291
When your professor cries

1427
01:29:31,499 --> 01:29:33,433
''Everybody, down on the heels

1428
01:29:33,634 --> 01:29:34,623
Up on the toes

1429
01:29:34,835 --> 01:29:37,269
Stay after school
Learn how it goes''

1430
01:29:37,471 --> 01:29:40,838
Everybody do the Varsity Drag

1431
01:29:44,845 --> 01:29:46,779
Here is the Drag

1432
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:49,040
See how it goes

1433
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:51,184
Down on your heels

1434
01:29:51,385 --> 01:29:53,512
Up on your toes

1435
01:29:53,721 --> 01:29:56,588
That's the way to do the Varsity Drag

1436
01:29:58,226 --> 01:30:00,217
Hotter than hot

1437
01:30:00,428 --> 01:30:02,487
Newer than new

1438
01:30:02,697 --> 01:30:04,597
Meaner than mean

1439
01:30:04,799 --> 01:30:06,858
Bluer than blue

1440
01:30:07,068 --> 01:30:10,094
Gets as much applause
As waving the flag

1441
01:30:13,908 --> 01:30:15,876
You can pass many a class

1442
01:30:16,077 --> 01:30:18,102
Whether you're dumb or wise

1443
01:30:18,312 --> 01:30:20,280
If you all answer the call

1444
01:30:20,481 --> 01:30:22,540
When your professor cries

1445
01:30:22,817 --> 01:30:24,978
''Down on your heels

1446
01:30:25,186 --> 01:30:26,949
Up on your toes

1447
01:30:27,154 --> 01:30:29,281
Stay after school

1448
01:30:29,490 --> 01:30:31,424
Learn how it goes''

1449
01:30:31,626 --> 01:30:33,685
Every

1450
01:30:33,894 --> 01:30:35,987
Everybody

1451
01:30:36,197 --> 01:30:38,995
Step right up and do
The Varsity Drag

1452
01:32:28,075 --> 01:32:29,940
The boy
Garçon

1453
01:32:30,144 --> 01:32:32,078
Gets girl
La fille

1454
01:32:32,279 --> 01:32:34,179
That's good
C'est bon

1455
01:32:34,382 --> 01:32:36,145
The show fini

1456
01:32:36,350 --> 01:32:40,446
The moral to this tale is
Learn to parlez-vous

1457
01:32:40,654 --> 01:32:42,815
Send her a billet doux

1458
01:32:43,023 --> 01:32:45,253
Tell her
Her eyes are blue

1459
01:32:45,459 --> 01:32:47,120
They sure are blue!

1460
01:32:47,328 --> 01:32:52,095
Je vous adore
Means I love you

1461
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:01,173
Come here to me

1462
01:33:01,375 --> 01:33:05,209
Good news!
