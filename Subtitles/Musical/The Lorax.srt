something in a plastic bottle,

And what's more, when
we build a new factory

just going to get worse.

for you to go, Beanpole!

360
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,968
Just going to put them right back in.
We can do this all day.

361
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,251
Stop right there! Stop it!

362
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:11,481
So you would hammer one of
nature's innocent creatures?

363
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,126
What? No!

364
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,011
I would never hit this little guy.
You, on the other hand,

365
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,441
I would gladly pound you

366
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,249
and your mustache
into the ground!

367
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,008
Behold! The intruder
and his violent ways.

368
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,050
Shame on you.
For shame!

369
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,089
All right, you know what?
That's it!

370
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,003
You listen to me,
you furry meatloaf.

371
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,526
I'm going to chop down as
many trees as I need. Okay?

372
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,841
Newsflash!
Not going anywhere!

373
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,844
End of story.

374
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,051
Then you leave me no choice.

375
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:50,045
If you're not gone by the time
the sun sets on this valley,

376
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,205
all the forces of nature
will be unleashed upon you

377
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,644
and curse you until
the end of your days!

378
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,486
You have been warned.

379
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,883
(GRUNTING)

380
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,490
Thanks.
Yeah, okay.

381
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,847
You have been warned.

382
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,001
But I didn't listen
to his warning.

383
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,322
And you won't believe
what happened that night.

384
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,401
What?

385
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,562
If you want to hear more,
come back tomorrow.

386
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,043
Hey, wait, wait! Tomorrow?

387
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,360
Whoa!

388
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,090
Whoa-ho-ho.

389
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,241
Are you serious right now?

390
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,846
Ah! You live in
the middle of nowhere!

391
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,407
It stinks out here.
Don't make me come back!

392
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,007
I guess you don't really want
to hear the rest of the story.

393
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,081
(SCREAMS)

394
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,647
No, no.

395
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,571
I do. I really do. I want to
hear the story. I just...

396
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,530
Nah! You don't have
what it takes. Goodbye.

397
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,127
Wait, wait!
I have what it takes.

398
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,728
It's all right. It's
okay, I'll come back.

399
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,926
It's no problem.

400
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,766
See, here I am, leaving.
Walking away now.

401
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,326
I'll see you tomorrow.

402
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,087
Mmm.

403
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,923
Maybe. Just maybe.

405
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,411
What did you wish for, Audrey?

406
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,801
Well, I would love to tell you,

407
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,680
but, sadly, according to the
universal wish laws, I cannot.

408

409
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,004
TED: I know
what she wished for.

410
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,330
Was it, perhaps...

411
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,205
This?

412

Ted, you didn't.

415
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,603
Oh, no. I totally did.

416
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,525
Happy birthday, Audrey.

417
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,324

Ted. Tedster.
Huh!

421
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,649
You're kissing the
cereal again, hon. What?

422
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,531
I just...
I like this cereal.

423
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,761
What one is this?
Yeah!

424
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,445
Okay.

425
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,126
Well, I'll make sure to buy
extra next time for you.

426
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,931
All right, cool. Hey, I got to run.
I got to go do athing.

427
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,604
So, I'll see you guys.

428
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,683
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

429
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,489
You're not going
anywhere, young man.

430
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,847
(SIGHS) It's Sunday. You
know what that means?

431
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,810
Family time, and we're
all playing board games!

432
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,961
But...

433
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,967
Hmm.

434
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,371
Mmm?

435
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,126
Oh, man.

436
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,010
Mom, seriously every turn?

437
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,684
Hey, back off!

438
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,326
Ooh!

439
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,483
No.
Okay! Family time is over.

440
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,683
It is now personal time.
I'll be in my room.

441
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,361
Okay, dear. Have fun.

442
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,921
(GASPS)

443
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,128
I knew I could break her.

444
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,367
Go.
Huh?

445
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,566
Go see him!

446
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,926
Oh, yeah!

447
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,206
You rule!
Thank you, Grammy.

448
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,887
Whoa!

00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,685
(GROANS)

450
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,723
Hey! Ted, right?

451
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,167
Um, Mr. O'Hare?

452
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,403
So, I hear you have
become interested in trees.

453
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,164
What's that all about?

454
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,767
Oh. Um...

455
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,051
Where did you hear that?

456
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,167
(CHUCKLES) Oh.

457
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,924
Teddy, there's not much
that goes on in Thneedville

458
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,729
that I don't know about.

459
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,486
Here's the deal, I make a living
selling fresh air to people.

460
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,086
Trees?
They make it for free.

461
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,891
So, when I hear
people talking about them,

462
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,328
I consider it kind of
a threat to my business.

463
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,088
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

464
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,123
You listen to me, boy.

465
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,642
Don't go poking around in
things you don't understand

466
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,802
or I'll be your
worst nightmare.

467
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,691
I'm Frankenstein's head
on a spider's body!

468
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,840
Yeah, um...

469
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,843
Okay, my mom is expecting me.
So, I'm just going to...

470
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,565
Of course, of course. Now, go
back to your family game time.

471
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,322
Grandma just finished her turn.

472
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,281
How did you know?

473
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,003
Please. I have
eyes everywhere.

474
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,961
Huh!

475
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,407
You got a beautiful
town here, Ted.

476
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,848
Lots of fun stuff to occupy
your short attention span.

477
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,003
Why, I can't
think of any reason

478
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,688
you would ever want to
go outside of town again.

479
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,807
Ever.

480
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,290
Okay! Good talk.
Really good talk.

481
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,640
(PANTING)

482
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,601
Oh, no.

483
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,561
Look out!

484
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,122
Hey, man? You know, you need
to change that door bell.

485
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,842
Oh, you missed me.
What?

486
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,131
You're already back. Clearly,
you missed me a little. Right?

487
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:56,007
No, I didn't. I'm just here
to hear the end of the story.

488
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,730
Why are you so interested
in trees anyway?

489
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,211
Why aren't you like other kids,

490
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,521
break dancing and
wearing bell-bottoms,

491
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,682
and playing the Donkey Kongs?

492
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,367
(LAUGHS) Yeah, right, right.
I don't know.

493
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,925
Uh, I just thought it would be kind
of cool to have one, you know?

494
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,246
Huh?

495
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,810
It's a girl, isn't it?

496
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,724
What? No!

497
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,611
Really? Because when a guy
does something stupid once,

498
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,250
well, that's because
he's a guy.

499
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,766
But if he does
the same stupid thing twice,

500
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,491
it's usually to
impress some girl.

501
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,410
Hey, she is not some girl!

502
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,404
She's a woman, in high school.

503
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,530
And she loves trees.
And I'm going to get her one.

504
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,881
Aw!

505
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,806
How nice to see someone so
undeterred by things like reality.

506
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,967
Thank you.

507
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,883
All right,
but where did we leave off?

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,241
Oh!

515

You got to be kidding me.
Can he swim?

Of course he can't swim!

528
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,571

I'm coming to get you!

we found one of your socks
and came here to return it.

you were asleep. What?

Ew!

605
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,007
Exactly. And sleeping
is the body's way

want to wring it out first.

What are you doing here?

906
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,721
Happy yet? You fill that
hole deep down inside you?

907
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,763
Or do you still need more?

908
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,446
Look, if you've got a problem
with what I'm doing,

909
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:09,203
why haven't you used your
quote-unquote powers to stop me?

I told you,
that's not how it works.

Right, I forgot.
You're a fraud.

912
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,371
I need you
to get out. Now!

you uncomfortable?

You can just shut your mustache.
My conscience is clear.

918
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,365
I have done nothing illegal.

919
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,920
I have my rights, and I
intend to keep on biggering

920
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,044

Truff ula trees into Thneeds.

That may stop you.

Somebody sure made
a bundle on that thing.

927
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:30,448

Hey, look,
I don't want any trouble.

933
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:20,086
And you won't get any.
Not from them.

934
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,845
Thanks to you and your hacking,
and smogging and glupping,

935
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,843
they can't live here any more.

936
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,290
So, I'm sending them off.

937
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,851
Hopefully,
they'll be able to find

938
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,763
a better place
out there somewhere.

Hey...

943
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,960
So, this is
really all your fault.

944
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,883
You destroyed everything.

945
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,886
Yes.

946
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,242
And each day
since the Lorax left,

947
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:15,369
I've sat here regretting
everything I've done,

948
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:19,684
staring at that word, "unless,"

949
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:23,284
and wondering what it meant.

950
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,124
But now I'm thinking...

951
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,567
Well, maybe you're the reason

952
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,847
the Lorax left that word there.

953
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:32,049
Me? Why would he
leave that for me?

954
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,562
Because unless someone like
you cares a whole awful lot,

955
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,763
nothing is going to get better.

956
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,124

958
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,122
You need to plant it, Ted.

959
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,483
Yeah, but, nobody cares
about trees any more.

960
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:07,920
Then make them care.

961
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,329

town, where everyone can see.

small and insignificant,

but it's not about what it is,

01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,968
it's about what it can become.

He knows his own
name and everything.

01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:11,329
You know what I would love
right now, Mrs. Wiggins?

993
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,323

stay here and talk.

ahead and adopt him?

it right in the middle of town

1070
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,041
Loser!

1071
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,043
Oh, really?

1072
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,090
Oh, no. The seed!

1073
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:10,411
Get that seed!

1074
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,489
Hang on! Here we go!

1076

01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:32,840
Seriously, how cool
is your grandma?

(GROANS)

1079
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,007
No!

1080
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:45,487
Come on!

1081
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,281
Yeah, that's right.

1082
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:48,807
There it is!

1083
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:00,849
Hey! Watch the road,
you meathead!

1084
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,041
Ah!

1085
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:08,841
Hey, ow, ow!

1086
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:10,761
Oh, come on!

1087
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:21,401
What the...

1088
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:25,087
Get it unstuck, get it unstuck!

1089
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:28,764
Bring it on, Teddy!

1090
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,444
You don't have the guts!

1091
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,167
Ted!

1092
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,765

1093
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,041
Whoo-hoo!
Yes!

1094
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:51,767
Hey, hey, hey!

1095
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,365
Hey! It's Mr. O...

1096
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,130
Take that, shorty!

1097
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,247
(LAUGHS)

1098
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,128
Okay, we have to get
this in the ground.

1099
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,806
But where?
There's no dirt anywhere.

1100
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,769
No, Grammy...

1101
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:30,281
MAN: Hey, get out of there!

1102
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,047
Ah!

1103
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:36,727
Hey!

1104
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,809
What?

1105
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,566
See, what did
I tell you? Easy. Huh?

1106
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,321
Hey, they broke O'Hare's head!

1107
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:48,528
WOMAN: What do you think
you're doing, kid?

1108
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:52,001
Um, I'm looking for
a place to plant a tree.

1109
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,207
A real one.

1110
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,645
Why would we need a tree?

1111
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,688
Exactly.

1112
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:00,805
Oh, man.

1113
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,407
Folks...

1114
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:06,567
The last thing you
want around here is trees.

1115
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,245
They're filthy!

1116
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:14,169
Spewing that sticky, nasty
sap all over the place.

1117
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:19,000
They bring poisonous ants
and stinging bees.

1118
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,650
Hey!
Ouch.

1119
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,165
Think about the kids.

1120
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:26,640
And, I just thought,
you know, they make leaves!

1121
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:27,926
You know that, right?

1122
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,843
Then these leaves,
they just fall.

1123
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,684
They just fall
wherever they want!

1124
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:32,807
(EXCLAIMING)

1125
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,008
Come on! We know why you're
really against trees.

1126
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,282
Because they produce fresh air.

1127
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,566
For free!

1128
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,210
Oh!

1129
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:43,887
I am wounded!
You have lied!

1130
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,482
It is not a lie!
It's called photosynthesis.

1131
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,688
Come on.
She's making that up!

1132
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,491
That's a
made-up word, people!

1133
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:56,281
Thneedville is perfect
just the way it is.

1134
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:58,363
We don't need trees!

1135
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,803
That boy has a seed.

1136
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,686
We need to stop him!
Who's with me? Come on!

1137
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,040
O'Hare is right!

1138
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,328
Seeds will ruin us all!
Stop it!

1139
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,926
Last chance, kid.
Hand it over!

1140
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,640
Where do you think
you're going?

1141
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,211
Come on, let's go!

1142
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,328
Get in, get in!

1143
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,320
Hey!

1144
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,204
Stop that maniac!

1145
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,645
Excuse me, excuse me.
Watch out!

1146
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:32,291
Ted, you're going
to hit the wall!

1147
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:34,249
Yeah. I know.

1148
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,361
Wow. Did you see that?

1149
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:02,327
Who does this kid
think he is, huh?

1150
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:05,564
I am Ted Wiggins.

1151
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,402
And I speak for the trees.

1152
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:13,523
And the fact is, things aren't
perfect here in Thneedville.

1153
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,125
And they're only
going to get worse,

1154
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,441
unless we do
something about it,

1155
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,082
unless we change our ways.

1156
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:23,409
And we can start
by planting this!

1157
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:24,766
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

1158
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,844
Okay. Come on, now.
Everything is fine.

1159
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:36,721
Right?

1160
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:40,441
I say we tell this kid
what we think about that seed!

1161
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,884
People, come on!

1162
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,528
You! Get out there right now

1163
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:54,366
and get these people on my
side, or else you're fired!

1164
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,091
Go on, tell them
what you think.

1173
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:30,764
<i>We should let it grow</i>
