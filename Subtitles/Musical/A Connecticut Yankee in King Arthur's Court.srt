1
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:13,498
There you are.

2
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:18,894
Say, has, uh, this castle
always had four turrets?

3
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,098
Always.

4
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,533
Four turrets.

5
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,544
That doesn't seem right.

6
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:30,746
If you hurry, sir,
you'll still be in time
to catch the last tour.

7
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,751
Thanks.

8
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,581
The room you are now
standing in...

9
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,353
is an ancient banquet hall.

10
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,690
And this table,
ladies and gentlemen,

11
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:45,492
is said to be the famed
Round Table...

12
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,499
used by King Arthur.

13
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:51,401
Many of the restored shields of
the Knights of the Round Table
can be seen on these standards.

14
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,405
Sir Bedivere.

15
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:55,464
Sir...
[Man]
Sir Bors de Ganis.

16
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,510
Sir...
Sir Lancelot of the Lake.

17
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,643
If you don't mind!

18
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:03,648
Not at all.
Go right ahead.

19
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:07,083
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
if you'll kindly follow me.

20
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,356
Over here,
ladies and gentlemen,

21
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:14,552
we have the shields
of Sir Galahad,

22
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,788
Sir Dalliance,

23
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,832
and Sir Sagramore
le Desirous.

24
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,561
Good old Saggy.

25
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:25,468
And over here,
ladies and gentlemen,

26
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,972
a remarkably preserved
portrait.

27
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,066
Lady Alisande la Carteloise.

28
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:34,375
[Woman]
Wasn't she lovely?
Lovely indeed, madam.

29
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:39,783
She was renowned in legend
as King Arthur's
favorite niece.

30
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:42,753
Over here,
ladies and gentlemen...
Pardon me...

31
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:46,485
we have a hauberk dating
from the sixth century...

32
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,926
said to have been worn
by Sir Logris of Astolat.

33
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,658
Kindly notice the round hole
through the breastplate,

34
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:56,532
undoubtedly caused
by an iron-tipped arrow
of the period.

35
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,696
Mm-mmm.

36
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,569
I mean... Well, you see,
that happens to be
a bullet hole.

37
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,508
Impossible!
Firearms weren't invented...

38
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,636
until the 15th century.
[Chuckles]

39
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:10,080
Oh, come now.
Perhaps the gentleman
saw the bullet fired.

40
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:12,208
Perhaps the gentleman
was there.

41
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,583
Matter of fact, I was.

42
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:19,921
Undoubtedly caused
by an iron-tipped arrow
of the period.

43
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:25,593
Well, uh,
that concludes the tour,
ladies and gentlemen.

44
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:29,601
On behalf of the orphanage
and Lord Pendragon,
I hope you've enjoyed it.

45
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,695
This way out, please.
Thank you.
It's been most interesting.

46
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,497
I beg your pardon, sir. Lord
Pendragon would like to see you.
Hmm?

47
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,564
Well, that's
very nice of him.

48
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,873
Just as I remember her.

49
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:17,040
[Clears Throat]
This way, sir.
Yes.

50
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,281
"Just as I remember her"?

51
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:30,795
And she dead
these 1300 years.

52
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,797
[Knocking]

53
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:36,665
Come in, come in.
[Sneezes]

54
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,670
And shut the door.

55
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:43,771
That's the worst
of these confounded castles...
very picturesque and all that,

56
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,834
but the wind whistles through
like a howling gale.

57
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,779
This is
the American gentleman,
Your Lordship.

58
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,681
I'm quite aware
it's the American gentleman.

59
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,912
You may go, Richards.
But, Your Lordship...

60
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:56,250
Go, go. Scat.

61
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:01,058
Now, no tricks, young man.

62
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,619
I warn you,
I boxed for Cambridge
until my arm...

63
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,631
[Sneezes]

64
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:12,728
Now, what's all this
I hear about your
creating a disturbance?

65
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,739
You don't look balmy.

66
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,934
I assure you,
Your Lordship,
I'm perfectly sane.

67
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:20,001
Well, stop staring at me
as if I were a ghost.

68
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,946
Have we met before?
Here.

69
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:25,483
Well, no, not exactly.
What do you mean,
not exactly?

70
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,714
Either we've met before
or we haven't.
It's difficult to explain.

71
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,814
L-I feel like I know you.
I know this castle...

72
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,826
and the girl in
the painting downstairs...
Lady Alisande.

73
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,124
I know her too.
Wait, wait. Don't ring.

74
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:38,925
I wanna show you something.

75
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,559
Take a look at this.
What is it?

76
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,569
It's a gold amulet,

77
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:47,765
just like the one
on the girl in the painting.

78
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,638
Yes, yes, of course.
Of course.

79
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,474
A remarkable duplicate.
It's not
a duplicate, sir.

80
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,538
Where did you get it?
She gave it to me.

81
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:59,312
Young man,
you're either a liar
or a lunatic,

82
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:02,115
and I'm not gonna sit here...

83
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,348
Here.

84
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,191
Thank you.
Excuse me.

85
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:12,893
I've been wanting to
get this off my chest
for a long time.

86
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,830
I'm not keeping you
from anything, am I?
[Mutters]

87
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,198
My name is Martin.
Hank Martin.

88
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,069
I was born in Hartford,
Connecticut, U.S.A.

89
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,075
I'm a blacksmith,
and my father
was a blacksmith before me.

90
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:28,045
Or I was a blacksmith
until a few years ago, when
these automobiles came along.

91
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,811
Boy, it sure is
powerful-looking.
Boy, it sure is.

92
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,512
Go ahead and touch it.
I dare you.
[Engine Sputtering]

93
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:37,317
You do it.
I asked you first.

94
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,381
Yeah, he asked you first.

95
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,133
[Backfires]
[Screams]
Look out!

96
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,535
Did you fix it, Hank?
I fixed it, all right.

97
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,102
The operation was a success,
but the patient died.

98
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,546
Well, we'll give her
another whirl, huh?

99
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,676
You kids in no hurry?
No, not me.

100
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,686
What do you suppose
makes it go?

101
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:11,655
- I know. There's a dragon in it.
- A what?

102
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:16,024
A dragon,
just like in King Arthur,
that spits and shoots out fire.

103
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:19,087
- Oh, you're daffy.
- I am not, am I, Hank?

104
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:23,431
I think she's got
something there. What we need
is a little dragon bait.

105
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,799
[Engine Sputtering]
Say, it's taken a hold.

106
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:32,038
Oh, there's a dragon
in there, all right.

107
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:34,875
[Backfires,
Engine Stops]

108
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,848
I think it's a reluctant dragon.
We'll let it cool off a while.

109
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:45,285
Does that book tell you
how to fix automobiles, Hank?

110
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,485
This book tells you
how to fix everything.

111
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,721
At least that's what the
fellow said that sold it to me.

112
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,229
Wow! Look at that.
What is that thing, Hank?

113
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,766
Yeah, what is it, Hank?
That's a phonograph.

114
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:58,133
That'll bring
a 20-piece band
smack into your parlor.

115
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,662
Drums and everything?
Sure.
Drums and everything.

116
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:06,007
There's an electric light bulb,
a magic lantern and a motorcycle.

117
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,012
Wow! Look at that!

118
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,743
You mean we're gonna have
all those things someday, Hank?

119
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:15,719
Son, every one of those things
in that book, every item,
we got 'em right now.

120
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:18,256
You know why we got 'em? Because folks
who other folks thought were crazy...

121
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,258
went out and invented 'em.

122
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:23,159
That's how things get done...
by folks who shoot high,

123
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,823
who just won't admit
they're licked.

124
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:37,509
Oh, there's nothin'
to be ashamed of

125
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,978
If you stub your toe
on the moon

126
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:44,244
When a dream's
at the top of the sky

127
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,252
Well, you just have
to jump pretty high

128
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,552
But don't give up too soon

129
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:55,151
If you stub your toe
on the moon

130
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:59,129
Now, you take Harry Hadgetts.
[All]
Who's Harry Hadgetts?

131
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:02,827
Young Harry Hadgetts
loved making gadgets

132
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:06,065
"Life needs some new things"
was his claim

133
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:09,869
Hoped one or two things
might bring fame

134
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,809
This is the last time
you'll hear his name

135
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:17,042
Nobody mentions
Harry's inventions

136
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,347
But do you think
that got him down

137
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:24,719
Here comes the end
When you've gadgets to mend

138
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,453
He's the best repairman
in town

139
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:32,486
So there's nothin'
to be ashamed of

140
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,728
If you stub
your toe on the moon
Fred.

141
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:39,293
When a dream's at
the top of the sky

142
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:43,103
Well, you just have to jump
pretty high, high

143
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:46,838
But don't give up too soon

144
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:50,439
If you stub your toe
on the moon

145
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:53,485
Now, you take
Sally Springer.
Who's Sally Springer?

146
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:56,350
Well, it's a long story,
but I'll cut it down for you.

147
00:10:56,422 --> 00:11:00,358
Sweet Sally Springer
she was a singer

148
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:03,259
Lived in a hall room
up one flight

149
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:07,425
Thought of a ballroom
big and bright

150
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,027
Where she would make
her debut some night

151
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:14,732
Then for her trouble
"Pop" went the bubble

152
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:18,072
Say that it's sad
but, wait, don't weep

153
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:22,911
Now they admit
every night she's a hit

154
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:27,578
When she sings
her children to sleep

155
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:31,555
[All]
No, there's nothin'
to be ashamed of

156
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:35,253
If you stub your toe
on the moon

157
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:39,696
Though it may be a blow
to your pride

158
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:44,862
You're a hero because
well, you tried
Good boy.

159
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:48,304
So don't give up too soon

160
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:52,276
If you stub your toe
on the moon

161
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,749
Don't give up too soon
[Meows]

162
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:06,383
If you stub your toe
on the moon
[Backfires, Engine Starts]

163
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:11,528
[Backfires,
Engine Stops]

164
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,792
Well, there's a moral there
someplace, kids.

165
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,391
[Man]
Hiya, Hank.
Hey, Sam.

166
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,937
Old Man Miller's
madder than a wet hen.

167
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,165
Said you promised to have
his pinto back by noon.

168
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,869
By George, I did!
Well, this'll have to wait
till later, kids.

169
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,139
Aw, gee!
Come on.
Everybody out.

170
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:30,705
See you in the mornin'.
7:00 be too early?
[All Shouting]

171
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:34,412
Good, good.
All right, good-bye.
See you tomorrow!

172
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,718
Say, if that cat
spits up a spark plug,
it's mine.

173
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:48,394
- [Thunderclap]
- [Whinnies]

174
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:51,630
Whoa, Tex. Take it easy.
I don't blame you.

175
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,763
Looks like we're in
for a wet night.

176
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,703
[Thunderclaps Continue]

177
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,304
Whoa, there.
Whoa!
[Whinnying]

178
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,549
Whoa, Tex!
Whoa!

179
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,277
Monster, will you battle?

180
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,412
Will I do what?

181
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,753
Will you joust?
Will you venture
a passage at arms?

182
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,853
Huh?

183
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,832
Up, dog!
[Armor Screeches]

184
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,834
Up, dog,
and defend thyself!

185
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:59,666
Up, I say!

186
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:03,538
Look, old man,
I don't know where you got
that iron Union suit,

187
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,169
but I've been up all night
and I'm in no mood for jokes.

188
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:09,874
Here, Tex.
Here, Tex.
Stay where you are, monster.!

189
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:13,544
I give warning:
Spit forth one flame of fire...

190
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,553
and I shall hack thee
limb from limb!

191
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,451
Here, now.

192
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,497
Skip. Go ahead.
Run along before
they come and get you.

193
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,361
Before they come?

194
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:31,062
Your keepers.
They should be here any minute.

195
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:34,663
Parley will gain thee not!
Dost admit defeat?

196
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,368
Look, I told you before,
I'm in no mood...

197
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:39,377
Dost admit defeat?

198
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,576
Dost.
By all means, dost.

199
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:46,812
Forward, knave.
Thou art captive of my lance.

200
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,820
I'll play along
with you.

201
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:58,563
Hey, tell me, bub,
who art thou?

202
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,929
I hight
Sir Sagramore le Desirous,

203
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,934
Knight of the Round Table.

204
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,493
Howdy.
I hight Hank Martin.

205
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,373
Those turrets...

206
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,876
I've never seen them before.

207
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:16,244
That can't be Bridgeport.
Yonder, varlet, is Camelot.

208
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,907
Camelot?

209
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:20,918
Capital of
the kingdom of Britain...

210
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:23,079
residence in state
of King Arthur's Court.

211
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:28,085
King Arthur?
What year is this?

212
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,720
This is the year
of our Lord, 528.

213
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:36,224
Five hundred and twenty-eight?

214
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,704
I guess I owe you an apology,
brother. I'm the guy
they're coming after.

215
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,141
Forward, knave.

216
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,716
Raise for Sir Sagramore!

217
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,130
Hold, monster.
Bind the prisoner.

218
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,137
Bind the prisoner!

219
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,800
Here, here. Whoa.
What's this?

220
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:21,141
Here, now,
there's been a mistake.
Get me a lawyer.

221
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,579
Where's the head fellow
here?
Forward, monster.

222
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,710
Where is the king?
In the Great Hall, sire.

223
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,390
Enough! To thy post.
Aye, sire.

224
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,394
[Armor Screeches]

225
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,396
Forward to the Great Hall.

226
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:47,664
[Fanfare]

227
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,700
[Orchestra]

228
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,321
[Sneezes]

229
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,322
Oh, confound this castle.
It's a veritable cave of winds.

230
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:12,057
Somebody close the door.
The king speaketh.

231
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,156
Close the door!

232
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,224
[Man]
Close the door.!

233
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:19,236
[Man #2]
Close the door.!
[Door Slams Shut]

234
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,295
The door closeth.

235
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,840
When

236
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:33,715
Is sometime

237
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,311
How many days

238
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,448
Until sometime

239
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:43,484
For my dreams make it clear

240
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:47,089
That my lover is near

241
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:53,571
And he ought
to be here about

242
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:58,633
Sometime

243
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,474
Who

244
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:05,108
Is someone

245
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:11,555
Who is
this wonderful someone

246
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:16,356
Oh, I'm keeping
my heartstrings

247
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:21,593
In tune

248
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,761
And hoping

249
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:29,069
That sometime

250
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:33,771
Is soon

251
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:54,625
It is I,
Sir Sagramore!
[Armor Screeches]

252
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,601
Cease thy speaking!

253
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,734
And thy babbling.

254
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,466
Who

255
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:35,302
Is someone

256
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:42,075
Who is
this wonderful someone

257
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:46,743
Oh, I'm keeping
my heartstrings

258
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:52,256
In tune

259
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,918
And hoping

260
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:58,053
That sometime

261
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:03,124
Is soon

262
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:07,161
Oh, I'm hoping

263
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:10,265
That sometime

264
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:14,836
Is soon

265
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,087
[Stops]

266
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:27,148
Excellent, child.
You take after
my side of the family.

267
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,194
We were all fine singers
until my throat...

268
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,195
Thank you, my liege.

269
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:35,131
With Your Majesty's permission,
I have prepared
a song for the lute.

270
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,464
It's a simple thing...
Away, child.

271
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:40,471
If there's one thing
that curdles the appetite
of an already-addled stomach,

272
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,803
it's a lute solo.

273
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,610
Well, well, well, well,
well, well, well, well, well.

274
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:49,977
What other amusement
have we in store this day?

275
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,707
[Screeches]

276
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,353
Sorry, my liege.

277
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:04,758
Noble King,
I crave pardon for this
most unseemly intrusion,

278
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,355
but I have just returned
from capturing the fiercest...

279
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,730
of all human dragons.

280
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:13,635
Behold, the monster!
[Murmuring]

281
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,639
I'm a monster.

282
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,476
A weird-looking creature.
How camest thou by him?

283
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,206
'Tis a most wondrous tale,
my liege.

284
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,215
I fear we're in for it.

285
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:28,344
My king,
ladies of the Royal Court,

286
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,150
fellow Knights
of the Round Table,

287
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,589
while riding
in a far land...

288
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,822
I came upon a concourse
of a thousand ogres.

289
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:39,090
And despite their numbers,

290
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:43,396
determined to capture the most
sky-towering giant among them...

291
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:47,734
Oh, here, now.
Wait a minute. I was alone.
I was asleep under a tree.

292
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,740
Cease, monster!

293
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,944
From dawn till dark
and dark till dawn, we battled.

294
00:21:56,014 --> 00:22:00,451
With lance and sword,
I laid upon the demon throng...

295
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,510
till all were dead but one...

296
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:05,385
the fiercest ogre of them all,

297
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,982
when finally
I drove him to corner.

298
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,551
He changed into a dragon,

299
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,427
bellowing fire
and flame upon me!

300
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:18,800
When that availed him naught,
he became a tusked
and taloned werewolf.

301
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,804
Oh, now, see here,
Your Majesty...

302
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:25,206
At last, the beast changed
to his present form,

303
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,837
and with one mighty bound...

304
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:30,882
leaped to the topmost
branch of a tree...

305
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,179
200 cubits high!

306
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:35,276
I picked up a stone...

307
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:39,620
the size of a bullock
and hurled it at the beast.

308
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,625
He fell to my feet.

309
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:47,521
And here, milord,
here is living proof...

310
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,533
of my mighty deed.

311
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:52,866
[Sparse Applause]
I thank thee.

312
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:57,568
Your Majesty,
mayeth I sayeth a few words?

313
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:00,543
- In the first place...
- Silence, ogre!

314
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,978
What makest thou
of the creature, Merlin?

315
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:07,382
A most dangerous and evil demon.
The beast must be destroyed.

316
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:09,886
A hanging?
No.

317
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:12,719
Burning at the stake,
my liege.

318
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,720
Pardon, milord,

319
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:19,355
but the monster
seemeth a gentle soul.

320
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:22,958
Gentle?
He hath nice eyes,

321
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:26,526
and his features
are not unpleasant.

322
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:30,097
True, true.
Monster, has thou a name?

323
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:33,269
Hast. Martin.
Hank Martin.

324
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:36,576
The truth now.
How camest thou to this kingdom?

325
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:40,584
Well, I'm a little confused
as to how I came here,

326
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,586
but I did come from Connecticut.

327
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,354
Hast heard of, uh,

328
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,361
what he just said?

329
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,124
Couldst be in Ireland.

330
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,722
Oh, no.
It's way past Ireland.

331
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,327
You lie. There's naught
beyond Ireland
but the Great Sea.

332
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:02,736
Trapped by his own words,
my liege.

333
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:07,268
An evil demon
confronts us, whose abode is
the dismal depths of the ocean.

334
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:10,803
Destroy this pestilence
e'er he destroy us!

335
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,850
Thou hast a good point,
Merlin.
[Man] Death to the monster.!

336
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:15,148
[All Shouting]

337
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,211
Quiet, quiet!

338
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,223
Oh, my ears.

339
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,952
Monster,

340
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:25,826
I have bad tidings for thee.

341
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:28,889
Tomorrow morning,
thou burnest at the stake.

342
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,901
Take him away.

343
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,405
Well, Your Majesty,
if I can just have a minute to...

344
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,442
I'd like to explain this...
Wait a minute! Hey! Help!

345
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,443
Wait.! Help.!

346
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,911
[Chattering]

347
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,809
'Tis said this monster
has seven heads.

348
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,937
Aye, and
a forked tail.

349
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,811
It is I, Sir Sagramore.
Open for Sir Sagramore.

350
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:32,689
[Door Closes]
Well, what do you want now?

351
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:35,494
I have brought thee
a dainty tidbit
from the king's kitchen.

352
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,501
Roast meat.

353
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:40,504
At this point, roast meat
doesn't appeal to me.

354
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:43,370
When do l...
Within the hour.

355
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:47,036
How thou must hate me for
the mischief my foolish tongue
has caused thee.

356
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,171
You ought to be press agent
forJack the Ripper.

357
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:51,181
An ogre, you called me.
Dragon, werewolf.

358
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:53,683
No wonder
they wanna get rid of me.
Cease.

359
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:56,016
I feel bad enough.

360
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,783
If there were aught
I could say, aught
I could do to save thee...

361
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:00,882
Well, ain't there aught?

362
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,824
Naught.

363
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:08,265
Wait!

364
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,438
Zounds! What an idea!
An idea?

365
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:18,374
Who hast condemned thee?
'Tis Merlin,
the maker of miracles.

366
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,741
What if thou
shouldst create a miracle?

367
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:24,248
What if thou shouldst prove
a greater sorcerer?

368
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,250
Doing what?

369
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:31,722
Nay. Nay.
'Tis a foolish thought.

370
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,418
A greater sorcerer than Merlin?
None such exists.

371
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:36,426
He's the champion, huh?

372
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,331
I have grown
to like thee, monster.

373
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,333
'Tis sad to part.

374
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:47,170
'Tis sad.

375
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:53,076
Farewell.

376
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,773
[Door Closes]

377
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,579
[Sighs]
Within the hour.

378
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:18,931
Well, now, if it's
a miracle they're after...

379
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,938
[Humming]

380
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,974
Meet the new champion.

381
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,617
[Orchestra]

382
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:00,507
No, no, no, no.
All these folderols
simply to burn a man.

383
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:03,411
Verily it grows monotonous.
Aye.

384
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:06,075
But the Romans had
a more amusing procedure.

385
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,813
They boiled their victims
in oil.

386
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:10,980
Boiled them in oil?
[Chuckles]

387
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:15,789
Splendid.
Hast not seen a lobster boil,
Your Majesty?

388
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,794
Truly, Morgan,
thou art brilliant.

389
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,763
All right,
all right, all right.
Let's get started.

390
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:23,801
Thou knowest
this early morning air
bringeth on my vapors.

391
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,393
The king speaketh.
Bring on the beast.

392
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:29,065
Bring on the beast.!
Bring on the beast.!

393
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,700
Must we have
these eternal echoes?
Bring on the beast.!

394
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:34,836
[Fanfare]

395
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,828
Now, that's strange.

396
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,831
The creature seemeth
in splendid spirits.

397
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,833
'Twill avail him naught.

398
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:00,337
Fire and flame will destroy him
and all his demon magic.

399
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,873
Milord,
does he have to die?

400
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:04,932
Of course he has to die.

401
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:07,773
You certainly don't
expect me to disappoint
all these people, do you?

402
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:12,108
Thou art to be commended,
Sir Sagramore, for thy part
in these festivities.

403
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:14,845
Nay.
My heart weigheth heavily.

404
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,116
Hear ye
the proclamation of death!

405
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,856
Monster, thou hast by trial,
both just and fair,

406
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,864
been found guilty
of the following crimes.

407
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,730
First, of assuming
through demon wizardry...

408
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,737
the form of
a man-devouring ogre,
Stay away, clouds.

409
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,898
Of a fire-breathing dragon,
Good old sun.

410
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:39,967
And of tusked
and taloned werewolf.

411
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:43,912
Second,
of conspiring with Beelzebub
and the powers of evil...

412
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,473
to bring calamity
upon this kingdom.

413
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:49,486
Therefore, monster,

414
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:53,149
by order
of His Sovereign Majesty
King Arthur of Britain,

415
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:55,818
thou art hereby condemned
to perish...

416
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,590
by the flame and...
[Screaming, Shouting]

417
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:03,997
Merlin, he's bewitched!

418
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:08,229
Have no fear, my liege.

419
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,764
I shall cast a spell
upon this demon.

420
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:33,497
- I fear thee not, monster.
- Boo.

421
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:41,462
I, Merlin,
sorcerer to the king,

422
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:45,498
do hereby render helpless
the evil demon
within this monster...

423
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,636
and route forevermore...

424
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:50,340
his magic wizardry,
and I command the gods...

425
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:52,849
to wither his tongue,
to still his limbs, to...

426
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:55,852
Psst, psst.
Smiley, you're burning up
a little there.

427
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:01,252
Thou art the devil himself!

428
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:04,991
Is there no end to his sorcery?

429
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:07,258
Do you give up?

430
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:10,960
Aha.
Just as I thought!
Hey...

431
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:16,132
No forces of evil did cause
this mischief, my liege.

432
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:19,438
'Twas but this bauble,
this toy,

433
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,479
which any child can worketh.

434
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,981
Start workething, bub.

435
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,720
I command thee,

436
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:35,418
maketh fire and flame.!
Any news?

437
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:39,629
Maketh fire and flame!
[Laughter]

438
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:44,030
No talent, huh?

439
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,831
[Laughter Continues]

440
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:49,706
A few words, Your Majesty.

441
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:53,232
I am a wizard.
I'm a whiz of a wizard.

442
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:56,405
Matter of fact,
just about the best
in the business.

443
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,745
And if you don't mind
my saying so,

444
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:02,047
it's a pretty good thing for you
I'm not quick-tempered.

445
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:07,119
[Scoffs]
Slim, release me here.

446
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:08,590
Come on, quickly.

447
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,731
I might lose my temper here
and burn up a lot
of good acreage.

448
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:21,067
Now, watch closely
and I'll show you what I mean.

449
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:26,042
I have here, Your Majesty,
a common, ordinary twig.
Presto!

450
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:31,713
[Gasping, Murmuring]

451
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,842
You could imagine what
I could do with a tree.

452
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,311
For my next miracle,
ladies and gentlemen...

453
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:39,583
Desist! Desist, monster!
I prithee!

454
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,624
And now, Your Majesty,
hang onto your crown be...

455
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,934
because, uh, I'm about to...

456
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:56,064
No more, monster!
I beseech thee!

457
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,301
Spare my kingdom!

458
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,644
Name thy terms,
and I will grant them.

459
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:05,012
Well, I would like
to stick around here
a little while, maybe.

460
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,176
Half my domains are thine.

461
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:09,185
Oh, no. Just...

462
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:11,278
Just a little...
little blacksmith shop
would be all right.

463
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:15,822
A smithy. Granted.

464
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:18,521
And if you could arrange it,
I'd like to associate...

465
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:22,965
with these lords and ladies
in a little more
sociable atmosphere.

466
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:26,663
A ball, as soon as 'tis possible
to accoutre thee properly.

467
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,797
This fellow that captured me...
what about him?

468
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:30,602
The dog shall die.

469
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,109
Aye.!
Burn Sir Sagramore.!

470
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,702
Aye! Burn Sir Sagramore!

471
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,714
[Shouts Of Approval]

472
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:40,774
Burn Sir Sagramore!
Burn Sir Sagramore!

473
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:47,789
[Chuckles]
In oil, huh?
[Hank] Oh, no.

474
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,656
No. Wait a minute.
I like him.

475
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:53,322
Hmm. Why, he shall be
thy squire.

476
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:56,629
[Hank]
I wouldn't be without a squire.
And one really important thing.

477
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,329
As long as I seem to be
the boss around here,

478
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:02,403
don't you think I ought to have
a title to go with it?

479
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:05,567
Approach and be knighted.

480
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,201
[Fanfare]

481
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,546
Here.
Practice with this a while.

482
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:23,555
On thy knees, sire.

483
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:49,612
I dub thee...

484
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:51,621
I dub thee Sir Boss!

485
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:53,520
[All]
Hail to Sir Boss!

486
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,193
Hail to the Boss!

487
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,456
Hail, Sir Boss.

488
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:03,964
Methinks I liketh Camelot...

489
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:06,435
a lot.

490
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:16,146
Zounds, but thou hast
a handsome figure!

491
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:19,980
Now, take it easy, Saggy.
I know you're grateful,
but don't overdo it.

492
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:22,212
The ball awaits thee.
This way, milord.

493
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,890
Hope some man
doesn't ask me to dance.

494
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,324
[Orchestra]

495
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,069
For thee, sire.

496
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:47,407
Well, how about introducing me
to the cast of characters?
Pardon, sire?

497
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:50,970
I wouldst know whom
I meeteth this night.

498
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:52,982
The king, for instance.

499
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,280
What's he like?
Aprince among men.

500
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:57,913
And, uh, Merlin?

501
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,952
A devil, who by cunning
and trickery...

502
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:06,463
has come to rule the kingdom.
A villain, huh?

503
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:09,796
Who's the dark-haired lady
with him there?

504
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,461
Morgan le Fay,
the king's niece.

505
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:16,598
If aught should happen
to the king, Merlin would
see to it that she is queen.

506
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,801
Well, aught better
not happen then, huh?

507
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,472
Who?

508
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,184
Another of the king's nieces.

509
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:30,778
Milady Alisande la Carteloise.

510
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,789
Is she married

if we but smile.

I can hardly keep
my feet still.

Thou mayest think me bold,
but wouldst dance with me?

Why, certainly.
I'd love to.

I don't want to seem
aggressive or anything,

hast heard my
latest exploit?

00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,267
This is our dance.

542

By all means, yes.

Hast thou an affliction
in thine eye, sire?

I'm afraid it's in my heart.

of the lid.
I understand thee not.

it's a token of affection.

these fellows out.

00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:45,316
That's what I'm trying
to tell you. Just like
it says in the almanac.

686
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:47,323
What's an almanac?
Doesn't matter.

687
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:49,325
They all say the same thing.

688
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:55,995
Once and for always

689
00:48:56,066 --> 00:49:01,129
Let's say that it's agreed

690
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:04,002
Agreed

691
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:08,602
Wishing days are over

692
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:12,274
This is all we need

693
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:15,113
And tonight

694
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:17,949
We'll notify

695
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:21,320
The stars

696
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:25,828
Above

697
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:30,799
That once and for always

698
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:34,325
And no less

699
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:37,498
Than always

700
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:41,203
You and I

701
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:43,769
Will be

702
00:49:43,847 --> 00:49:47,715
[Vocalizing]

703
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:52,278
In love

704
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:06,527
I shouldn't have done that, huh?
'Twas mine fault
as much as thine.

705
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:09,504
Well, then this one's on me.

706
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:18,847
Will I see you tomorrow?

707
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:21,907
'Twould be most...
Tomorrow then,
at my smithy.

708
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:27,414
Logris, thou art a friend
of Lancelot's.

709
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:29,755
Wouldst say
he is a jealous man?

710
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:32,818
Most jealous.
Knowest thou
his whereabouts?

711
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:34,830
They say he's bound
for the north country.

712
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:37,389
A day's ride
would reach him.
A night's ride.

713
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:39,401
Thou must leave at once.

714
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,309
Stay, Sir Lancelot!

715
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:51,246
Sir Lancelot!

716
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,150
Stay, Sir Lancelot!

717
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:00,422
Evil tidings, my friend.

718
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:04,426
An interloper from
a foreign land has gazed with
ardor upon the Lady Alisande.

719
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:07,327
Huh? Name
of this interloper?

720
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:12,357
- Sir Boss.
- Sir Boss.
I ride forthwith to Camelot.

721
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:15,064
But the quest, sire.
The quest shall wait.

722
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:18,005
First, I must disembowel
a scurvy knave!

723
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:29,243
'Tis a monstrous
sorcerer within.

724
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:31,253
Most monstrous!

725
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,026
Well, let's see here.

726
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:40,229
Two inches off the cuff.

727
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:46,066
[Chuckles]
You got me a little there.
Thou art indeed a wizard.

728
00:51:46,136 --> 00:51:48,798
When 'tis done,
'twill become thee
as fittingly as it did...

729
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:50,806
to Sagramore le Desirous.

730
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:53,172
Sir Sagramore le Desirous.

731
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:56,178
We've got to do something
about that.

732
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:58,271
Say, when you were a kid,
did you have a first name?

733
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:00,373
Aye. But from
that day to this,

734
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,941
no man has dared breathe it
in my presence.

735
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:06,386
But you're gonna tell me.
Wild horses
could not drag it from me.

736
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:09,118
Come on, Saggy.
'Fess up.

737
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:14,794
To my undying shame,
'twas Clarence.
Clarence.

738
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:20,299
Suits your personality too.
I dub thee Clarence.

739
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:23,066
Whoop.
As you will, milord.

740
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,074
[Humming]

741
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:33,506
Hi, men. Oh, well,
you'll get used to me.
Who's this?

742
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:36,677
Who cometh in
the yonder covered wagon?

743
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:39,221
'Tis the Lady Alisande.

744
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:41,223
I warn thee, milord,
this meeting is unwise.

745
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:45,159
The girl is betrothed.
I'll take care
of this thing, Saggy.

746
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:47,162
But, sire...

747
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,768
Sandy.

748
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:56,237
Hank.
Thanks for coming.

749
00:53:00,544 --> 00:53:02,409
In truth, l...
I did not want to come.

750
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:05,277
I know.
You just came to tell me
that you couldn't make it.

751
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:08,146
Honey, I've got something
awfully important to ask you.
Could...

752
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,686
[Giggling]

753
00:53:12,088 --> 00:53:14,852
Well, it's
a little crowded here.
Could we...

754
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,856
I hate to run out on
you fellows, but you can see
how important this is.

755
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:22,865
Mind the children, Clarence.

756
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:29,568
Abracadabra! Boom!

757
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,941
The children are gonna
love me around here,
aren't they?

758
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:37,639
Say, I got a little trinket here
that I whipped up for you.

759
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:41,047
For me, sire?
Hath it a name?
Yes.

760
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:43,677
Well, in my country,
we call it a safety pin.

761
00:53:43,753 --> 00:53:45,687
Wouldst sitteth down?

762
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:48,781
'Tis a strange device.
What purpose serveth it?

763
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:51,349
Well, it hath
a myriad of purposes.

764
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:54,829
For instance, uh,
do you have a handkerchief?

765
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,866
A kerchief, sire?
A kerchief, yes.

766
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:01,870
You expecting a cold?

767
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:05,598
You take, uh...
You take it like this,

768
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:09,668
over there, over there,
and this up here.

769
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:12,442
Now we take our little gadget,
you see, and...

770
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:16,578
hook it up there.

771
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:19,121
There you are. See?
Amazing, sire.

772
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:21,521
Isn't it, honey?
But to what purpose?

773
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:24,958
Huh? Oh.
[Chuckles]

774
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:27,121
To what purpose?

775
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:29,529
Well, in the south,

776
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,295
they call them AuntJemimas,
I think.

777
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:35,031
Now, you wanna get
the little gadget off there.

778
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,835
You just unlatch it like that.
There you are. Presto.

779
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:40,740
Safe, sound and simple,
isn't it?
It's a miracle.

780
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:45,076
Well, not exactly a miracle,
but certainly
a very handy little gadget.

781
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:48,413
[Gasps]
I didn't mean to scare you.
And that's not a miracle either.

782
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:50,510
That's just a little gadget
called a magnet,

783
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:52,578
based on an idea cooked up
by a fellow named Ben Franklin.

784
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:54,590
This is yours.

785
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:58,053
'Tis a handsome gift, sire,

786
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:01,891
but I cannot accept it.

787
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:05,025
It would not be honorable.

788
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:08,935
You should know this, sire.
I'm betrothed to Sir Lancelot.
I did know.

789
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:11,565
But...
Please, honey,
let me do the talking.

790
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:14,940
Sandy, I haven't been around
here very long. There's a lot
of things I don't know...

791
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:16,979
how I got here,
how long I'm gonna be here...

792
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:20,278
I do not comprehend.
Don't try to follow me.
Please. Just listen.

793
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:25,378
What I'm getting at is this:
Would you consider
being betrothed to me?

794
00:55:25,455 --> 00:55:28,219
But Sir Lancelot.
We'll get to him later.

795
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:32,250
Do you love him?
Lancelot is a wonderful man.

796
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:35,492
Brave, stalwart, handsome.
Do you love him?

797
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:37,032
A wife would be proud
of such a husband.

798
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:39,092
Do you love him?

799
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,771
No, Hank.

800
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:45,330
Hallelujah!

801
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:50,573
No, no. Thou must not.
'Tis most unseemly.

802
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:52,581
Why?

803
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:56,517
Dost thou not understand?
I am betrothed to Sir Lancelot.

804
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:58,918
I know. I know.

805
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:01,320
But when does he get back?
Perhaps a month.

806
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:03,791
Well, you leave
everything to me.
I'll handle old Lance.

807
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,828
But I fear for thee,
Hank.

808
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:09,126
Sir Lancelot's anger is
known to freeze the hearts
of the most courageous.

809
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,133
Sandy, don't worry.
Now, please.

810
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,829
Just toddle along home
to the castle.
But, Hank...

811
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:16,201
Don't you trust me, Sandy?

812
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:19,070
Yes, I trust thee,
Hank.
Good. Here.

813
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:22,111
You forgot something.
I'll see you later.

814
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:31,318
Okay, men, shove off.

815
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:34,322
Heave ho.

816
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,985
Departeth.

817
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,528
Forward!

818
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:57,208
[Clanging]

819
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:18,433
Sir Boss?
Yeah?

820
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:22,096
I must warn thee.
What about? Did you get
the squeak out of there?

821
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:24,538
Methinks I have, sire.
Behold...
[Loud Screech]

822
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,700
Not entirely.
Not entirely.

823
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,676
But, sire,
I must warn thee.
Yeah?

824
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,773
Art occupied, blacksmith?

825
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:37,252
Have care, sire.
Yeah, okay.
I'll fix that in a minute.

826
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,653
I got a cash customer here.
Wait a minute.
What's on your mind, friend?

827
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:42,657
Death to a scurvy knave...

828
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:44,989
whom I shall find
before this day has ended.

829
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:46,995
Wouldst have an edge
on my weapon!

830
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:50,825
Yes, well, you came
to the right place, friend.

831
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,301
I guess you'd like
a little edge on the lance too,
wouldn't you?

832
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:58,306
I'll get it.

833
00:57:58,374 --> 00:58:01,571
Well, don't stand there
fidgeting. Give me
a lift here. Come on.

834
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:20,219
By george, big fella,
you've got your dander
up today, haven't you?

835
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:22,628
Hate to be the guy
you're looking for.

836
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:24,496
[Screeches]

837
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:26,797
In a minute.
In a minute.

838
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:28,895
This man has
urgent business here.

839
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:31,440
Somebody do you wrong?
A grievous wrong.

840
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:34,306
Well, I can tell.
When a fella's as mad
as you appear to be,

841
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:36,641
there's generally a woman
at the bottom of it, right?

842
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:40,149
Thou art wise, blacksmith.
Somebody stole
your gal, huh?

843
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:44,050
Naturally, you're gonna
take steps... long steps.

844
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,714
I shall seek out
this interloper,

845
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:49,087
and be he the size
of ten giants...

846
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:52,252
and hath he the strength
and fury of a thousand lions,

847
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:54,455
I shall meet him upon
the field ofhonor
and thrust him through...

848
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,726
like an ox on a spit.

849
00:58:58,101 --> 00:59:01,002
Ah, but the end
shall not come swiftly.

850
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:04,870
Mark you, the death
of this knave who calleth
himself Sir Boss...

851
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:07,569
shall become legend,
a warning to all...

852
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:09,805
who would covet
the betrothed of another.

853
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:12,871
I don't blame you.
If I was in your spot...

854
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:17,219
Did you say "Sir Boss?"

855
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:20,381
Aye, blacksmith.
A scourge on the dog.

856
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:23,425
Well, now...
[Clears Throat]

857
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:26,860
Perhaps we ought to think
this over in the cool
of the evening.

858
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:29,660
We don't wanna be too hasty
about these things.

859
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,927
- What sayest thou?
- No offense, friend.

860
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:34,266
I just don't want you
to do something that
we'll both regret.

861
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:37,068
What wouldst suggest?
There are two sides
to every question.

862
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:40,303
I suggest you sit down
with this fella and
try and talk it over.

863
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:42,401
They tell me
he's a fine boy.

864
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:44,912
A message for thee, sire.
'Tis from the Lady Alisande.

865
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:48,109
It must be for you, friend.
No, Sir Lancelot.

866
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:50,914
'Tis for Sir Boss here.
[Clanging]

867
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,025
Sir Boss!

868
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:02,359
"Beware. Lancelot cometh."

869
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,832
[Chuckles]
And here you are.

870
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:07,699
If you excuse me, I have
a couple of irons in the fire.
Wait!

871
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,704
I hurl the gauntlet
in thy face.

872
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:14,476
Good day, sire.

873
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:18,105
Good day.

874
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:25,751
Clarence, are you there?

875
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:27,756
[Screeches]

876
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:32,519
Aye. The die is cast.

877
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:35,587
Tomorrow you joust
with Sir Lancelot.

878
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:39,066
And the one who lives
shall become the betrothed
of Lady Alisande.

879
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:42,800
[Sighs]
I don't like the odds.

880
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:57,853
[Fanfare]

881
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:10,830
All right, we're here, Merlin.
Show us some blood.

882
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:15,633
Aye, blood.
Sir Boss's blood.
Anybody's blood!

883
01:01:15,705 --> 01:01:18,173
I will hasten
the proceedings, my liege.

884
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,282
Fear not, my friend.

885
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,808
I have cast a magic spell
upon thy evil opponent.

886
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:35,085
I thank thee, Merlin.
I have no need
for casting of spells.

887
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:45,033
[Chuckles]

888
01:01:46,602 --> 01:01:49,901
Be of good cheer, sire.
Perhaps couldst perform
a miracle.

889
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:53,237
Afraid not.
With all this stuff on
it slows up my thinking.

890
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:55,368
[Fanfare]
What's that?

891
01:01:55,445 --> 01:01:58,937
'Tis just a minor scuffle
between two hot-blooded youths.

892
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:00,880
Sir Gareth and Sir Persant
of Wales.

893
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:02,815
Oh. A preliminary, huh?

894
01:02:05,955 --> 01:02:09,152
[Fanfare]

895
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:31,639
[Loud Clanging]
What's going on?

896
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:34,649
They gatherth up
Sir Persant, sire.

897
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:42,280
[Moaning]
That's tough luck,
old boy.

898
01:02:45,895 --> 01:02:48,159
But, sire, this man
is the winner.

899
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,700
Steady, sire.

900
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:01,600
Have confidence, milord.
Have courage.

901
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:04,111
Clarence, what a fella
will do for a girl.

902
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,615
If it wasn't for Sandy,
I'd be on my way
to Connecticut right now.

903
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:41,541
Another rope, serfs.

904
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:44,848
Wait a minute.
I can't handle this.
This is awful.

905
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:48,186
Let's see. If I don't
go through with it,
I'm a coward, huh?

906
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:50,384
If I do go through with it,
I'm a dead hero.

907
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:52,654
Isn't there
something in-between,
something conservative?

908
01:03:52,728 --> 01:03:54,958
Nay, sire.
Nothing, eh?

909
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:57,158
[Neighing]

910
01:03:57,233 --> 01:03:59,167
Tex.!
Tex, milord?

911
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:02,671
Get to the king and
tell him I've gotta have
a ten-minute postponement.

912
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:05,730
Tell him I've gone for
a mustard plaster. Hurry up.
Aye, sire.

913
01:04:05,808 --> 01:04:07,742
Oh-ho, you Tex.

914
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:20,682
[Fanfare]

915
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:25,056
But he hath no armor,
my liege.
Well, it's not my fault.

916
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:39,164
What manner of lunacy
is this?

917
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:41,904
No lunacy at all, friend.

918
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:44,378
Your Majesty, is there anything
in the book of rules...

919
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:48,110
which says that
I have to do my scuffling
in all that scrap iron?

920
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,045
In truth, there is nothing
which so specifies.

921
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:57,149
Why don't we get started?

922
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:59,160
On with the...

923
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,428
On with the joust.

924
01:05:02,498 --> 01:05:05,729
On with the joust.
[Man]
On with thejoust.!

925
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:09,532
[Man #2]
On with thejoust.!
[Fanfare]

926
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:12,631
[Crowd Cheering]

927
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:30,356
[Crowd Laughing]

928
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:36,627
I was there.
Where were you?

929
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:53,311
[Crowd Laughing]

930
01:06:12,935 --> 01:06:14,994
[Crowd Laughing]

931
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:19,397
Get set for a fast turn, boy.

932
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:32,237
Come on, boy.
Let's trample him.

933
01:07:48,531 --> 01:07:50,761
[Shouting]

934
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:57,767
[Crowd Laughing]

935
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:24,665
A neat trick, Sir Boss.

936
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:26,667
Thou hast not only
won the fair maiden,

937
01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:29,363
but given me the merriest
afternoon I've had in years.

938
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:32,100
[Sneezes]
In years.

939
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:34,108
Thank you, sire.

940
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:37,805
You proud, honey?
Proud?

941
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:41,281
Proud of my part
in this unseemly spectacle?
Oh, after all...

942
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:43,910
Proud that thou hast made
a fool out of such
a noble gentleman?

943
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:46,477
Well, I won, didn't I?
What do you want me to do?

944
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:49,285
I want you to apologize
to Sir Lancelot.
Apologize?

945
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:50,325
Yes.
For what?

946
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:55,058
For insulting him.
What do you expect, me to be
killed like a gentleman?

947
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:57,099
In truth, thou art
no gentleman.

948
01:08:57,166 --> 01:09:00,431
Wait. Where are you going?
I need to comfort
Sir Lancelot.

949
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:05,307
Well, after all, sire,
it's just the rules...

950
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:09,504
Hast thou not learned
there are no rules where
women are concerned?

951
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:13,480
Here, take this pill.
It will ease thy gripe.

952
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:19,220
[Banging]

953
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:30,560
Not too close, fellas.
Pray, sire, what art
thou contriving?

954
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:33,534
Just trying to keep busy,
keep out of trouble.

955
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:37,131
I think I'll let you fellas
in on a little secret.

956
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:40,369
See this gadget here?
That's a pistol.

957
01:09:40,442 --> 01:09:43,377
These little gimmicks...
bullets.

958
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:46,812
Stand clear. Stay right there.
I'll show you how it works.

959
01:09:46,882 --> 01:09:49,680
Suppose you're out
in the woods late one night...

960
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:52,312
and a big old wolf
all of a sudden pops up
in front of you.

961
01:09:52,388 --> 01:09:54,481
You wouldn't be scared,
would ya?

962
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:57,219
Oh, no, you wouldn't.
Not even a little, sire?

963
01:09:57,293 --> 01:09:59,784
No, sir, because you got
your trusty pistol with you.

964
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:01,853
All you do is just
hold it up like that,

965
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:05,526
pull back that hammer
like that, get all set, aim...

966
01:10:12,007 --> 01:10:15,636
Where'd everybody go?

967
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:18,612
It's all right, fellas.
You can come out now.
The big bad wolf is dead.

968
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,484
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

969
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:28,682
That's just a sample
of what's comin', fellas.

970
01:10:28,757 --> 01:10:31,385
The world is gonna be
chock-full of miracles...
useful miracles...

971
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:33,951
like the printing press,
the sewing machine,
bathtubs.

972
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:35,826
Bathtubs?
Yeah.

973
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:38,958
[With British Accent]
You mean we're all
gonna have to take baths?

974
01:10:39,034 --> 01:10:42,162
Every single Sat...
[With British Accent]
Every single Saturday, yes.

975
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,297
Greetings, milord.

976
01:10:44,373 --> 01:10:46,739
Hi, Saggy.
That's all, fellas.

977
01:10:46,809 --> 01:10:49,300
So long. See you tomorrow.
We've got big business here.

978
01:10:49,378 --> 01:10:52,438
Good night, sire.
Good-bye.

979
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:54,448
She won't see me?

980
01:10:54,516 --> 01:10:57,815
Rumor hath it that Lancelot
and Lady Alisande are
to be wed within the week.

981
01:10:57,886 --> 01:11:00,514
But she's not in love with him.
She told me so herself.

982
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:02,454
Female paradox.

983
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:06,226
Well, this changes things.

984
01:11:06,295 --> 01:11:10,129
There's an old saying in
Connecticut: "When you got
to 'git', 'git."'

985
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:12,633
Thou wouldst leave Britain?
There's nothing to
hold me here now.

986
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:16,330
- Greetings,
O Mighty Sorcerer.
- [Hank] Hello.

987
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:19,306
What's on your mind, honey?
Come in.

988
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:22,902
'Tis... 'Tis about my father.

989
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:25,970
What about your father?
He is sick
unto death, sire.

990
01:11:26,048 --> 01:11:29,279
For three days now he
has lay in a bed growing
weaker and weaker.

991
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:31,581
Now, now. Has the doctor
been to see your father?

992
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:33,588
No, sire. No one.

993
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:36,724
They say he hath the plague.

994
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:39,488
The plague?
Be gone, child!

995
01:11:39,561 --> 01:11:42,587
Clarence!
Please, Sir Boss.

996
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:45,133
Thou canst help him.
Thou art a mighty wizard.

997
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:48,931
We will pay you these coins,
and our pigs, we have two
of them, and a goat...

998
01:11:49,004 --> 01:11:53,703
I'm afraid you've got
me wrong. I'm not, uh...
Where do you live, honey?

999
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:56,108
But, sire...
Wait here for me.

1000
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:58,669
And don't be playing
around with that.
You might get hurt.

1001
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:01,375
With this toy, sire?
Put it down!

1002
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:03,384
Come along, honey.

1003
01:12:06,922 --> 01:12:10,323
Ridiculous that a mere trinket
should harm a grown man.

1004
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:14,055
Ridiculous.
Utterly ridiculous.

1005
01:13:40,949 --> 01:13:42,211
Who is it?

1006
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:45,617
A friend, ma'am.
A friend?

1007
01:13:45,687 --> 01:13:49,384
We have no friends.
Did you see the sign
outside?

1008
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:52,325
None may enter this house
of pestilence.

1009
01:13:52,394 --> 01:13:55,989
Fly, stranger,
while there is yet time.

1010
01:13:56,064 --> 01:13:58,999
If it's all right with you,
ma'am, I'll stay a while.

1011
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:03,763
Stay then,
and bless you.

1012
01:14:03,839 --> 01:14:05,966
Your husband?
My husband.

1013
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:08,601
Well, I'll be careful.
I'll try not to wake him.

1014
01:14:08,677 --> 01:14:11,441
That you will not,
for he is dead.

1015
01:14:12,981 --> 01:14:15,006
[Sobbing]

1016
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:17,017
Cry if you will, child.

1017
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:22,183
A month ago
this was our family...

1018
01:14:22,257 --> 01:14:25,886
a fine husband,
two strapping sons,

1019
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:27,895
a daughter.

1020
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:29,897
Now we're alone.

1021
01:14:30,966 --> 01:14:33,196
Your sons,
are they dead too?

1022
01:14:33,268 --> 01:14:36,396
Not dead,
but better dead.

1023
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:41,432
Years ago, the lord
of the manor planted certain
fruit trees on our farm.

1024
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:43,569
'Twas his right.

1025
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:46,876
His right?
'Tis the law, sire.

1026
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:50,680
Some time ago
three of those trees
were found hewn down.

1027
01:14:50,752 --> 01:14:54,950
Our sons ran frightened
to report the crime.

1028
01:14:55,023 --> 01:14:57,685
And although they themselves
were innocent,

1029
01:14:57,759 --> 01:15:00,626
they were accused
of the crime.

1030
01:15:00,696 --> 01:15:04,723
Well, in His Lordship's
dungeon, there they lie.

1031
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,667
And there they shall lie
and rot till they confess.

1032
01:15:09,037 --> 01:15:12,438
But such things can't be.
His Majesty wouldn't allow it.

1033
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:15,443
Truly thou art a stranger.

1034
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:17,911
[Sobbing Continues]

1035
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:20,175
Cry, child.

1036
01:15:20,249 --> 01:15:22,240
Would I could cry
with you.

1037
01:15:30,392 --> 01:15:33,759
It's a masterpiece.
A masterpiece!

1038
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:35,694
It needs
a touch of ermine.

1039
01:15:35,764 --> 01:15:38,631
Ermine and velvet?
'Twould clash, sire.

1040
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:42,500
They wouldn't
be happy together.
I want ermine!

1041
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:45,597
Oh, yes, sire.
Yes, certainly, sire.

1042
01:15:45,674 --> 01:15:47,869
Take it off.
Yes, sire. Certainly.

1043
01:15:47,943 --> 01:15:50,810
Ermine.
You shall have ermine.
[Grunts]

1044

1045
01:15:57,286 --> 01:16:00,016
More hot water.
[Man]
More hot water.!

1046
01:16:00,088 --> 01:16:02,556
[Man #2]
More hot water.!

1047
01:16:02,624 --> 01:16:04,615
Hot water.
Hot water!

1048
01:16:04,693 --> 01:16:06,957
[Man #3]
Hot water.
[Man #4] Hot water.!

1049
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:17,437
Blasted incompetents.
They can't even keep
the water hot.

1050
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:20,475
I don't how I've survived
all these years.
Things are bad all over.

1051
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:23,670
Why don't you get wise
to yourself? Get acquainted
with your people.

1052
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:27,340
My people? But I see
my people every day.

1053
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:30,249
I don't mean these musical
comedy personalities
around the palace.

1054
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:34,278
I mean your subjects.
How do you suppose
they feel about you?

1055
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:38,224
My boy, they love me.
On the morrow
I journey to London.

1056
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:42,957
All along the way my subjects
will be bowing and smiling
and doffing their hats.

1057
01:16:43,031 --> 01:16:47,161
Did you ever happen to think
that underneath those smiles
they may be hating you?

1058
01:16:47,235 --> 01:16:50,636
- Hating me?
- That's the word.

1059
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:54,608
But why?
I'm a good king.

1060
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:56,735
Good King Arthur
they call me.

1061
01:16:56,812 --> 01:17:00,475
It may surprise you to learn
that this country is crawling
with people who hate you.

1062
01:17:00,549 --> 01:17:04,679
Sick people, hungry people,
people who no longer hate you
because they're dead.

1063
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:07,620
Why, sire, I can tell you...
Cease!
[Groans]

1064
01:17:07,689 --> 01:17:09,782
Oh, heavens, I am sick.

1065
01:17:12,494 --> 01:17:15,463
And it's all your fault.
Young man, I could have
you hanged for this.

1066
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:18,727
But you won't.
'Cause I have a feeling
you believe me.

1067
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,268
All these lies
about my subjects?

1068
01:17:21,336 --> 01:17:23,736
Are they lies?

1069
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:25,898
I don't know.
I don't know.

1070
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:29,410
What, with my ill health,
how could I know anything?

1071
01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:31,969
If you don't know, sire,
I suggest you find out.

1072
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:34,106
Find out?
Yes.

1073
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:37,676
We could make a trip
around the country.
Might open your eyes a little.

1074
01:17:37,753 --> 01:17:40,221
But... how 'bout my cold?

1075
01:17:40,288 --> 01:17:42,813
This could easily help your cold
and your country.

1076
01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:44,886
A miracle?

1077
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,860
It could well be,
Your Majesty.

1078
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:52,923
How worketh we
this miracle?
Well...

1079
01:17:56,772 --> 01:17:58,740
How does
it strike you, sire?

1080
01:17:58,807 --> 01:18:03,335
Well, as thou sayest,
it's a... cinch?

1081
01:18:03,412 --> 01:18:05,778
A cinch.
A cinch.

1082
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:08,475
I postpone my official visit
to London.

1083
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:12,077
Make the trip disguised as
a humble freeman with Clarence
and me along for good luck.

1084
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:16,921
But dost think that any
humble garb can conceal
evidence of our royal blood?

1085
01:18:16,992 --> 01:18:19,620
It'll take a bit of doing,
but we'll handle it.

1086
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:22,459
Till dawn, sire?
Till dawn.

1087
01:18:42,417 --> 01:18:46,444
I'll only be a minute, honey.
I just wanted to say so long.

1088
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:48,455
So long?
Good-bye.

1089
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:53,125
Thou art leaving?
In a few hours.

1090
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:57,888
I see.
But I had to
tell you this.

1091
01:18:57,966 --> 01:19:01,697
I think you're doing
the right thing...
about Sir Lancelot, I mean.

1092
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:04,364
Why, marrying me would be
a national disaster.

1093
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:06,907
Disaster, sire?

1094
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:10,934
This knight business,
I'd... I'd be no good at it.

1095
01:19:11,012 --> 01:19:15,676
Instead of gettin' on a horse
and goin' out and polishing
off a few ogres or dragons,

1096
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:19,710
I'd be hanging around the house,
watering the lawn or fixing
the fence or something.

1097
01:19:19,788 --> 01:19:22,780
And our kids would grow up
and think their daddy
was a sissy...

1098
01:19:22,858 --> 01:19:27,158
because we'd be the only family
without a dragon's head
over the fireplace.

1099
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:30,823
It's better this way,
honey.

1100
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:33,459
You marry Sir Lancelot,
settle down...

1101
01:19:33,535 --> 01:19:35,901
and raise a lot of
little lords and ladies.

1102
01:19:38,406 --> 01:19:41,204
I hope you live
happily ever after.

1103
01:19:44,346 --> 01:19:46,143
Good-bye, Sandy.

1104
01:19:47,749 --> 01:19:49,683
So long, Hank.

1106
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:12,130

Do I look like a commoner?
Well...

1107
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:14,141
Well, what about this?

1108
01:20:15,377 --> 01:20:17,641
Yes, that helps.
Better.

1109
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:20,078
And this?

1110
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:22,082
Here. May I?

1111
01:20:23,718 --> 01:20:26,312
Thank you.
Oh, yes, much better.

1112
01:20:27,856 --> 01:20:29,790
Huh.

1113
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:34,160

01:20:44,306 --> 01:20:46,240
Shall we then?

1117
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:29,106
Logris,
thy men are ready?

1118
01:21:29,184 --> 01:21:33,587
I could start
at once, milady.
Slowly, slowly.

And stick around the rosebuds
so they'll know when to pop

01:25:28,022 --> 01:25:30,320
Dost realize, my friend,

1178
01:25:30,391 --> 01:25:32,859
that I am undoubtedly
the first of royal blood...

1179
01:25:32,927 --> 01:25:35,896
to possess this
strange affliction?

1180
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:39,229
Future sufferers
of this malady shall
know it by the name...

1181
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:41,234
King Arthur's Foot.

1182
01:25:41,302 --> 01:25:45,762
I don't think so, sire.
I think it's more likely
to be known as a bunion.

1183
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:49,936
What thinkest thou?
Has it been worth it seeing
your people as they are?

1184
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:54,072
In truth, I know not.
Their lot is indeed a hard one,
but it is a hard world.

1185
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:58,279
You've seen hunger and misery.
What more do you want?
I want a bath.

1186
01:25:58,353 --> 01:26:01,584
We took this trip
to prove to you that there
is want and oppression.

1187
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:03,590
Sir Boss.! Your Majesty.!

1188
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:07,059
Your Majesty, Sir Boss,
rise quickly.
People of quality approach.

1189
01:26:07,128 --> 01:26:09,221
Where?
Over yon hill.

1190
01:26:11,366 --> 01:26:13,300
Rise quickly, sire.!
They come closer.!

1191
01:26:13,368 --> 01:26:16,531
Let 'em come.
I've got a "binion."
No, no, it's a bunion.

1192
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:19,835
You're not king now,
you know. You're just
one of the fellas.

1193
01:26:19,908 --> 01:26:21,842
Come along.

1194
01:26:39,894 --> 01:26:42,328
Look down, sire,
as becomes a humble freeman.

1195
01:26:42,397 --> 01:26:44,695
I say, that's Bedivere.

1196
01:26:44,766 --> 01:26:47,963
Undoubtedly, he is taking
the Lady Bedivere to London
on a shopping tour.

1197
01:26:49,504 --> 01:26:51,301
That's not the Lady Bedivere.

1198
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:55,035
[Laughing]
Oh, the rogue.

1199
01:26:55,109 --> 01:26:57,202
Halt.

1200
01:26:57,278 --> 01:26:59,803
This'll make a toothsome
morsel for the court.

1201
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:02,748
So thou chooseth
not to bow, peasant!

1202
01:27:09,123 --> 01:27:11,557
A reward for thy insolence!

1203
01:27:15,029 --> 01:27:18,021
You need any further proof
of injustices, Your Majesty?

1204
01:27:18,099 --> 01:27:20,624
When reach we London?
On the morrow, sire.

1205
01:27:20,702 --> 01:27:22,897
A village lies ahead
where we can bed
for the night.

1206
01:27:22,971 --> 01:27:26,839
Good. On the morrow
there shall be changes.

1207
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:29,502
Not a bad idea.
Let's get our stuff.

1208
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:44,688
They lie hidden
within, sire.

1209
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:46,954
All three asleep?
As babes.

1210
01:27:47,028 --> 01:27:50,862
'Twould be a simple matter
to slit their throats.

1211
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:54,129
There will be no slitting
of throats yet.

1212
01:27:54,202 --> 01:27:57,865
I want them alive... now.
Aye.

1213
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:05,043
But, sire...
Shh! Your Majesty,
it's Sir Logris and his men.

1214
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:07,047
They're gunning for you.
[Shouts]
Gunning?

1215
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:09,640
Shh. Leave out
the gunning then,
but they're after you.

1216
01:28:09,717 --> 01:28:11,651
We're in trouble
up to our necks.
Trouble?

1217
01:28:11,719 --> 01:28:13,983
Shh! Shh!
Shh!

1218
01:28:18,192 --> 01:28:20,126
Come on.

1219
01:28:43,918 --> 01:28:45,852
Shh.

1220
01:28:54,262 --> 01:28:56,196
[Both]
Shh.

1221
01:29:04,706 --> 01:29:06,640
Three men
thou sayest?
Aye.

1222
01:29:06,708 --> 01:29:09,438
One broad and
strong as an ox...

1223
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:13,173
and the one with an odd
foreign manner of speech...

1224
01:29:13,247 --> 01:29:16,774
and the one the who said
he was king did sneeze.

1225
01:29:17,919 --> 01:29:19,853
The king shall reward
thy loyalty.

1226
01:29:19,921 --> 01:29:22,583
By the morrow
there may be no king.

1227
01:29:22,657 --> 01:29:25,353
He hath need
of friends, milady.

1228
01:29:25,426 --> 01:29:28,190
I thank thee.

1229
01:29:28,262 --> 01:29:30,890
Fetch me such clothes
as a boy might wear.
But, milady...

1230
01:29:30,965 --> 01:29:34,560
Do as I bid.
I journey to London.
Yes, milady.

1231
01:29:41,909 --> 01:29:46,903
Our next offer,
three male slaves
to be sold as a group.

1232
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:50,178
What is thy bid
for this fine specimen?

1233
01:29:50,251 --> 01:29:54,813
A bit soft, perhaps,
yet sound of wind
and limb.

1234
01:29:54,889 --> 01:29:58,450
- What is thy bid?
- Half a crown.

1235
01:29:58,526 --> 01:30:01,188
- Will anybody say
five shillings?
- Five shillings?

1236
01:30:01,262 --> 01:30:04,390
Who'll make it ten?
Ten shillings.

1237
01:30:04,465 --> 01:30:07,593
I'm bid. Who'll make it
one pound?

1238
01:30:07,668 --> 01:30:09,659
One pound.

1239
01:30:09,737 --> 01:30:12,399
One pound.

1240
01:30:12,473 --> 01:30:15,840
And for this
handsome specimen...

1241
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:17,673
[Crowd Laughs]

1242
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:20,543
Who only needs good food
and hard work...

1243
01:30:20,615 --> 01:30:23,709
to be brought to the peak
of physical perfection?

1244
01:30:23,785 --> 01:30:25,719
What is thy bid?

1245
01:30:25,787 --> 01:30:28,915
One farthing.

1246
01:30:28,990 --> 01:30:31,254
Make that a pound
or I'll have thee
boiled in oil!

1247
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:36,196
Ten pounds for the lot.

1248
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:38,698
[Auctioneer]
Ten pounds, sire?

1249
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:42,293
Ten pounds. Remove them
to the slave quarters.

1250
01:30:42,370 --> 01:30:44,770
Sold to the gentleman
with the beard...

1251
01:30:44,839 --> 01:30:46,773
for ten pounds.

1252
01:30:46,841 --> 01:30:48,775
Here, take 'em away.

1253
01:30:50,344 --> 01:30:52,278
Our next offer...

1254
01:30:52,346 --> 01:30:55,440
is this fine specimen
of womanhood.

1255
01:30:55,516 --> 01:30:57,541
Sound of wind and limb.

1256
01:30:57,618 --> 01:31:00,587
[Hoofbeats]
Look yonder, sire.

1257
01:31:03,324 --> 01:31:05,258
That's Tex.

1258
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:08,385
[Guard]
Move along.

1259
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:10,431
That youth,
doth he not seem familiar?

1260
01:31:10,498 --> 01:31:12,489
That's no youth,
Saggy.

1261
01:31:12,567 --> 01:31:14,558
[Auctioneer]
Who'll make it three pounds?

1262
01:31:14,635 --> 01:31:17,661
Who'll make it three pounds?
Do I hear three pounds?

1263
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:21,936
'Tis I, sire.
Go back, Sandy. You'll only
get in trouble here.

1264
01:31:22,009 --> 01:31:25,240
I'll not go back.
I came to help thee.
Honey, this is no place for you.

1265
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:29,807
- But, Hank...
- I would add the Lady Alisande
to our collection.

1266
01:31:29,884 --> 01:31:33,945
I'm not without friends.
I'll return soon.
Wait a minute. She... He...

1267
01:31:34,021 --> 01:31:36,251
Forward, slaves!
Move on!

1268
01:31:48,836 --> 01:31:51,600
Greetings, O Noble King.

1269
01:31:51,672 --> 01:31:55,608
Oh, do not rise, sire.
Nor any of thee.

1270
01:31:55,676 --> 01:31:59,009
Perceive
this monumental joke.

1271
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:01,640
My king would see his people
as they really are.

1272
01:32:01,716 --> 01:32:05,311
So what am I,
his devoted servant, to do?

1273
01:32:05,386 --> 01:32:07,513
Why, help him of course.

1274
01:32:07,588 --> 01:32:10,751
Help him to see
the miserable heart
of his domain,

1275
01:32:10,825 --> 01:32:13,589
not as a freeman,
not as a serf,

1276
01:32:13,661 --> 01:32:15,595
but as a slave.

1277
01:32:15,663 --> 01:32:18,496
Yes, my king
shall be a slave...

1278
01:32:18,566 --> 01:32:20,500
and all his friends too.

1279
01:32:20,568 --> 01:32:22,661
They shall journey
to the mines of Devon,

1280
01:32:22,737 --> 01:32:25,535
there to work and rot...

1281
01:32:25,606 --> 01:32:27,540
and eventually to die.

1282
01:32:28,776 --> 01:32:31,074
Sleep well, all of you.

1283
01:32:31,145 --> 01:32:33,409
You leave on the morrow.

1284
01:32:36,450 --> 01:32:39,146
Nice guy.

1285
01:32:44,892 --> 01:32:47,053
Are you asleep, honey?

1286
01:32:47,128 --> 01:32:49,824
Mm-mmm. I cannot sleep...

1287
01:32:49,897 --> 01:32:52,092
knowing that tonight
is the end of everything.

1288
01:32:52,166 --> 01:32:55,499
Oh, no. Don't you remember
the book and what it says?

1289
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:58,767
"Love once, but love
always and forever."

1290
01:33:01,842 --> 01:33:04,310
[Humming]

1291
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:08,872
You shouldn't
have come here, honey.
You'd be safe in Camelot.

1292
01:33:08,950 --> 01:33:11,145
But in Camelot
I'd not be content.

1293
01:33:11,218 --> 01:33:13,152
You mean
you're content here?

1294
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:16,189
Whatever happens,
we're together.

1295
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:19,852
You really mean that,
don't you, honey?
Yes, Hank.

1296
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:22,919
Now and for always.

1297
01:33:22,997 --> 01:33:25,932
[Humming]

1298
01:33:33,841 --> 01:33:35,934
Don't you know

1299
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:38,478
[Humming]

1300
01:33:38,546 --> 01:33:44,644
Always isn't
too much time

1301
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:47,517
Oh, that's so true.
Don't you ever
forget it either.

1302
01:33:47,588 --> 01:33:49,522
I won't, Hank.

1303
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:52,650
Are you comfortable?
Mm-hmm.

1304
01:33:57,398 --> 01:34:01,858
Once and for always

1305
01:34:01,936 --> 01:34:05,872
Let's say
that it's agreed

1306
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:11,806
Wishing days are over

1307
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:16,177
This is all we need

1308
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:20,186
And tonight

1309
01:34:20,254 --> 01:34:24,850
We'll notify the stars

1310
01:34:24,925 --> 01:34:27,985
Above

1311
01:34:28,062 --> 01:34:30,030
That once

1312
01:34:30,097 --> 01:34:33,589
And for always

1313
01:34:33,668 --> 01:34:36,535
And no less

1314
01:34:36,604 --> 01:34:39,767
Than always

1315
01:34:40,841 --> 01:34:45,278
You and I will be

1316
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:48,577
[Humming]

1317
01:34:48,649 --> 01:34:53,951
In love

1318
01:36:00,688 --> 01:36:03,179
[Footsteps]

1319
01:36:16,704 --> 01:36:19,036
[Gasps]

1320
01:36:19,106 --> 01:36:21,597
[Grunts]

1321
01:36:50,404 --> 01:36:52,964
If we get separated,
get the pistol
in the blacksmith shop.

1322
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,974
Aye, sire.
Come on, honey.

1323
01:36:55,042 --> 01:36:57,533
Hank. Wait, please.
What's that?

1324
01:36:57,611 --> 01:36:59,738
I've a strange foreboding.

1325
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:02,112
After this night
I'll not see thee again.

1326
01:37:02,183 --> 01:37:04,117
Oh, don't talk like that.

1327
01:37:04,185 --> 01:37:07,177
You take this, Hank.
And whenever you
look upon it,

1328
01:37:07,254 --> 01:37:10,621
remember thy love
in Camelot.
[King Arthur Sneezes]

1329
01:37:10,691 --> 01:37:13,023
His Majesty.
Let's get out of this.

1330
01:37:13,093 --> 01:37:15,254
Who goes yonder?
Who goes?

1331
01:37:16,597 --> 01:37:18,531
Guard.! Guard.!

1332
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,434
We best run,
Your Majesty.

1333
01:37:46,193 --> 01:37:48,024
Evil tidings, milord.

1334
01:37:48,095 --> 01:37:51,258
Sagramore has escaped,
killing a guard
in the process.

1335
01:37:51,332 --> 01:37:53,664
Hmm. He'll make for Camelot.

1336
01:37:53,734 --> 01:37:55,964
Send men to overtake him.
Aye, sire.

1337
01:37:56,036 --> 01:37:58,561
And remove the girl
to my tower.

1338
01:37:58,639 --> 01:38:02,837
And the other
two prisoners?
The other two?

1339
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:07,210
Ah, yes. Logris, I would have
thee remind the king...

1340
01:38:07,281 --> 01:38:10,773
of a law which he himself did
place upon the statute books.

1341
01:38:10,851 --> 01:38:14,753
What law, sire?
If one slave of a household
be guilty of murder,

1342
01:38:14,822 --> 01:38:17,552
then all male slaves
of the same household...

1343
01:38:17,625 --> 01:38:20,059
Shall die with him.

[Crowd Chattering]

1345
01:38:26,834 --> 01:38:29,428
[Crowd Cheering]

1346
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:44,510
Bring on the first prisoner.

1347
01:38:52,693 --> 01:38:54,923
I have but one wish.
Yeah?

1348
01:38:54,995 --> 01:38:58,260
To catch this blasted flea
before I die.

1349
01:38:59,566 --> 01:39:01,796
How much longer
wouldst thou say?

1350
01:39:01,869 --> 01:39:04,201
The man said noon.
It's about noon now.

1351
01:39:04,271 --> 01:39:06,569
[Ax Banging]
[Woman Screams]

1352
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:08,904
[Crowd Cheers]
[Guard]
Move.

1353
01:39:12,579 --> 01:39:14,706
Do you suppose I shall
have to remove my comforter?

1354
01:39:14,782 --> 01:39:16,875
Oh, no, you'll catch
cold again.

1355
01:39:18,652 --> 01:39:22,053
Supposeth thou could
extract another miracle
from thy book of wonders?

1356
01:39:22,122 --> 01:39:24,056
[Ax Banging]
[Crowd Gasps]

1357
01:39:24,124 --> 01:39:26,354
[Crowd Cheers]

1358
01:39:26,427 --> 01:39:28,987
It'd take an awful big stunt
to get us out of this.

1359
01:39:30,297 --> 01:39:33,164
It'd take just about
the biggest...

1360
01:39:33,233 --> 01:39:36,396
Wait a minute.
If I remember right...

1361
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:41,965
What day is this?
The 21 st day ofJune
in the year 528.

1362
01:39:42,042 --> 01:39:44,374
I think then, sire,
I have your miracle.

1363
01:39:44,445 --> 01:39:46,379
Is it a big one?
Oh, it's a whopper.

1364
01:39:46,447 --> 01:39:50,110
[Ax Banging]
Here's where
I make a comeback

1365
01:39:50,184 --> 01:39:52,118
[Crowd Cheering]

1366
01:39:55,923 --> 01:39:58,858
After you, my friend.
Please don't stand
on ceremony.

1367
01:39:58,926 --> 01:40:00,860
[Chuckles]

1368
01:40:02,062 --> 01:40:04,758
Step aside, please.
I have a few words to say.

1369
01:40:04,832 --> 01:40:08,632
My dear friends...
What manner of nonsense
is this?

1370
01:40:08,702 --> 01:40:11,535
Die in humility
as becomes a slave.

1371
01:40:11,605 --> 01:40:14,904
That's the old routine.
The trouble is
we're not slaves.

1372
01:40:14,975 --> 01:40:17,705
Then who art thou?
Sir Boss,

1373
01:40:17,778 --> 01:40:20,611
magician to
King Arthur here.
[Crowd Laughing]

1374
01:40:20,681 --> 01:40:23,741
Maker of miracles,
the mightiest wizard
of them all.

1375
01:40:23,817 --> 01:40:26,183
Now listen, all of you.
Unless the king and I...

1376
01:40:26,253 --> 01:40:29,017
and the rest
of these prisoners
are freed immediately,

1377
01:40:29,089 --> 01:40:32,354
I shall blot out the sun
and it will never shine again.

1378
01:40:32,426 --> 01:40:34,951
[Chuckling]

1379
01:40:36,163 --> 01:40:38,723
All right. Very well.
You asked for it then.

1380
01:40:38,799 --> 01:40:40,892
Now with a few
well-chosen words,

1381
01:40:40,968 --> 01:40:43,334
I shall blot out
the sun forever.

1382
01:40:44,538 --> 01:40:46,802

[Crowd Gasps]

1389
01:41:15,002 --> 01:41:17,937
Save us, O Mighty Sorcerer!
Save us!

1390
01:41:18,005 --> 01:41:20,030
Bring back the sun!

1391
01:41:20,107 --> 01:41:22,075
[Man]
I beseech thee.!

1392
01:41:22,142 --> 01:41:26,943
- [Woman] Release the sorcerer
in heaven's name.!
- Release him! Release him!

1393
01:41:27,014 --> 01:41:29,710
Stay this calamity.
I would rather die by the ax.

1394
01:41:29,783 --> 01:41:32,115
I'm sorry.
Even I can't stop this show.

1395
01:41:32,186 --> 01:41:34,347
[Woman]
Free him.!
[Man] Release him.!

1396
01:41:34,421 --> 01:41:36,412
Free him!

1397
01:41:36,490 --> 01:41:39,755
Set the prisoners free!
The lord mayor speaketh.

1398
01:41:39,827 --> 01:41:41,920
Set the prisoners free!

1399
01:41:43,197 --> 01:41:46,223
Very well. Hold it.

1400
01:41:47,734 --> 01:41:51,135
This is Sir Boss again.
You can come out now.

1401
01:41:53,540 --> 01:41:57,032
Olley, olley oxen free.

1402
01:42:09,556 --> 01:42:12,423
All right, release us.
Release His Majesty here.

1403
01:42:12,493 --> 01:42:15,428
Release
all these prisoners.
How can I thank thee?

1404
01:42:15,496 --> 01:42:17,430
Show me how to get
to Merlin's tower.

1405
01:42:17,498 --> 01:42:20,934
'Tis on the Inland Lake 'twixt
in Camelot. Thou wouldst
go there alone, unarmed?

1406
01:42:21,001 --> 01:42:23,970
Sandy's alone
and unarmed, isn't she?
Wish me luck, sire.

1407
01:42:24,037 --> 01:42:27,063
Come on. Release the king.
See you later.

1408
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:48,594
Sir Boss.

1409
01:42:48,662 --> 01:42:51,153
The king, is he...
Safe and sound in London.
Did you bring the pistol?

1410
01:42:51,231 --> 01:42:54,359
Aye, sir.
Where goest thou?
Sandy's in Merlin's tower.

1411
01:42:54,434 --> 01:42:56,368
Be not rash.
Let me come with thee.

1412
01:42:56,436 --> 01:42:58,904
Thanks, but you'd never
be able to keep up
on that nag.

1413
01:42:58,972 --> 01:43:03,170
Clarence, if anything happens,
it's been nice knowing you.
[Clicks Teeth]

1414

'Tis our friend
come to pay us a call.

1415
01:43:18,091 --> 01:43:20,491
Something's gone wrong.

1416
01:43:20,561 --> 01:43:23,724
Whatever's gone wrong
will soon be right again.

1417
01:43:23,797 --> 01:43:27,494
Lower the drawbridge.
See that the girl
is placed in the courtyard.

1418
01:43:27,568 --> 01:43:30,298
In plain view.
Understand?

1419
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:32,304
Aye, sire.

[Sobs]

1428
01:44:39,139 --> 01:44:41,107
Well, that's it.

1429
01:44:41,174 --> 01:44:43,369
When I came to,
I was back in Connecticut.

1430
01:44:43,443 --> 01:44:46,879
And Old Man Miller,
he come looking for Tex,
was kneeling over me.

1431
01:44:46,947 --> 01:44:49,211
And Sandy?
Sandy?

1432
01:44:50,617 --> 01:44:53,177
Never saw her again.

1433
01:44:53,253 --> 01:44:55,187
Well...

1434
01:44:55,255 --> 01:44:58,952
Young man, the view
from the east parapet...

1435
01:44:59,026 --> 01:45:01,824
is particularly lovely
at this time of the afternoon.

1436
01:45:01,895 --> 01:45:05,262
Yes, sir.
The east parapet, mind you.

1437
01:45:05,332 --> 01:45:08,495
My niece is usually there
about this time.

1438
01:45:08,568 --> 01:45:10,900
Thank you, sir,
and good-bye.

01:45:44,004 --> 01:45:45,938

1442
01:45:51,912 --> 01:45:53,846
Sandy!

1443
01:45:55,115 --> 01:45:57,049
How did you know my name?

1444
01:45:57,117 --> 01:45:59,551
I'm glad you asked me.

1445
01:45:59,619 --> 01:46:01,484
Won't you sit down?

1446
01:46:01,555 --> 01:46:04,285
This may take a little time.

1447
01:46:21,174 --> 01:46:23,404
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho
