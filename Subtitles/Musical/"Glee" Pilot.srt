Try being waterboarded. That's hard.

12

00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:48,775

14

He sure is, Mr. Schue.

15
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,686
Hey, Finn. You still owe me
that report on...

16
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:56,119
<i>- What?
- What you did last summer.</i>

17
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:59,420
Almost halfway done with
almost all of it, Mr. Schue.

18
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:01,824
- It's "Hammer time."
- Please. This is from Marc Jacobs's new collection.

19
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,385
Wait.

20
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:10,563
Okay.

<i>Where's the coffeepot?</i>

37
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,281
Figgins got rid of it.
Budget cuts.

38
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,757
You know, I know for a fact that
they are still getting hot java at Carver.

39
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,659
We should strike.

40
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,698
Hello, boys. Who needs a pick-me-up?

41
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:48,199
- Wow. Lattes.
- Yeah. I'm a bit of a coffee snob.

42
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:51,203
Now, the key to a perfect latte...

43
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,603
<i>is in the temperature of the steamed milk.</i>

44
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,402
- I like mine scalding.
- Wow.

45
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,340
- Hi, Emma.
- Hey, Ken.

46
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,901
- Will, hi.
- Hey.

47
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:03,642
- What's with all the lattes?
- Oh, Emma, I just felt so awful...

48
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:07,243
that Figgins cut the coffee budget to pay
for a nutritionist for the "Cheerios."

49
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,721
Yeah. I heard you guys went, like,
$600 over budget on that.

50
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:15,124
My performers didn't get on Fox Sports Net
last year because they ate at Bacon Junction.

51
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,459
Since when are cheerleaders performers?

52
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:22,791
Your resentment is delicious.

53
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,531
Well, I have a "phoner"
in a couple minutes...

54
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:28,301
<i>That's an interview on the telephone
with a major media outlet.</i>

55
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,036
<i>I'll probably do it on my iPhone.</i>

56
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,046
<i>- Enjoy.
- Thanks a lot, Sue.</i>

57
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,074
I missed you at the, uh...

58
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,744
singles mixer last weekend, Emma.

59
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,414
<i>Yeah, I know.
A big pipe exploded in my building.</i>

60
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,957
It was wild. I hate
those mixer things though. Don't you?

61
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,755
I mean, it's like a big meat market.
It's just... Ew.

62
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,796
I did give my number to a fireman though.

63
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,888
But he hasn't called.

64
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,400
There's someone out there for everyone.
I wouldn't even sweat it.

65
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:03,408
Mmm. Hey, did you hear
that Sandy Ryerson got fired?

66
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:07,173
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

67
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,613
- Who's gonna take over Glee Club?
- I don't know.

68
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:13,617
I'd like to take over Glee Club.

69
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,153
<i>You want to captain the Titanic too?</i>

70
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:18,748
I think I can make it great again.
There is no joy in these kids.

71
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:21,521
They feel invisible. That's why every one
of them has a MySpace page.

72
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:25,621
Sixty bucks a month. That's what I need
to keep this program up.

73
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,666
A-A-And you... you expect me to pay it?

74
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,759
Well, I'm certainly not
going to pay for it.

75
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:32,896
<i>We're not talking
about Cheerios here, Will.</i>

76
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:35,133
They were on Fox Sports Net last year.

77
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,234
When Glee Club starts bringing
that kind of prestige to the school again...

78
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,835
you can have all the money you want.

79
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,470
Until then, 60 bucks a month...

80
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:44,778
and you've got to use
the costumes and props we already have.

81
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:48,287
But we need the stools for wood shop.

82
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:53,616
<i>Hiding the $60 a month
from my wife, Terri, was gonna be hard.</i>

83
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:58,096
<i>But I had a bigger problem.
How was I gonna get these kids motivated?</i>

84
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,724
<i>One thing I knew for sure...
we needed a new name.</i>

85
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,860
New Directions!

86
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,366
<i>My name is Mercedes Jones,

00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,492
¶¶ I'm curious ¶¶

104
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:13,767
¶¶ For you caught my attention ¶¶

¶¶ I kissed a girl and liked it ¶¶¶¶

<i>You might laugh
because every time I sign my name...</i>

112
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,388
<i>I put a gold star after it.</i>

113
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,831
<i>But it's a metaphor.
And metaphors are important.</i>

114
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,393
<i>My gold stars are a metaphor
for me being a star.</i>

115
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,141
<i>Andjust so we're clear,
I want to clear up that hateful rumor...</i>

116
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:57,011
<i>that I was the one who turned
that closet case Sandy Ryerson in...</i>

117
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,449
<i>because he gave Hank Saunders
the solo I deserved.</i>

118
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,850
<i>That's cockapoopie.</i>

119
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,718
He was touching Hank, caressing him.

120
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,123
It was so wrong!

121
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,657
<i>I am not homophobic.
In fact, I have two gay dads.</i>

122
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,499
<i>See, I was born out of love.</i>

123
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:21,506
<i>My two dads screened potential surrogates
based on beauty and I.Q.</i>

124
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:24,975
<i>Then they mixed their sperm together
and used a turkey baster.</i>

125
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:27,205
<i>To this day, we don't know
which one is my real dad...</i>

126
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,305
<i>which I think is pretty amazing.</i>

127
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,543
<i>My dads spoiled me in the arts.</i>

128
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,051
<i>I was given dance lessons, vocal lessons...</i>

129
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,588

130
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,690
<i>You might think that all the boys in
school would totally want to tap this...</i>

131
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:47,790
<i>but my MySpace schedule keeps me
way too busy to date.</i>

132
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:51,894

135

Mr. Schuester, do you have any idea
how ridiculous it is to give...

165
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:51,684
the lead solo in "Sit Down, You're Rockin'
the Boat" to a boy in a wheelchair?

166
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,624
<i>I think Mr. Schue's using irony
to enhance the performance.</i>

167
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:57,891
<i>There's nothing ironic about show choir!</i>

168
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,590
Rachel.

169
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:02,656
Rachel!

170
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,296
That's sloppy!

171
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:12,003
You're sloppy, babies!
It's just disgraceful!

172
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,875
<i>And I want the agony out of your eyes!</i>

173
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:17,177
<i>Uh-uh, Lance. Don't you start crying!</i>

174
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:21,515
<i>You are the weak link, pal!
How does it feel to be the weak link, huh?</i>

175
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:24,488
<i>- That can't feel very good.
- You changed out of your costume.</i>

176
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,491
I'm tired of being laughed at.

177
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,864
You're the best kid in there, Rachel.
That comes with a price.

178
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:36,060
Look, I know I'm just a sophomore.
But I can feel the clock ticking away...

179
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,535
and I don't want to leave high school
with nothing to show for it.

180
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,902
You get great grades.
You're a fantastic singer.

181
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,702
Everybody hates me.

182
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,743
You think Glee Club is gonna change that?

183
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,108
Being great at something
is going to change it.

184
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:50,410
Being a part of something special
makes you special, right?

185
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,881
I need a male lead
who can keep up with me vocally.

186
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,148
- Maybe I can coach Artie a little. I...
- Look, Mr. Schue...

187
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,883
I appreciate what you're trying to do.

188
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,357
But if you can't give me
what I need, then I'm sorry.

189
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:03,793
I'm not gonna make a fool out of myself.

190
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:06,263
<i>I can't keep wasting my time with Glee.</i>

191
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,664
It hurts too much.

192
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:11,100
Schuester!

193
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,035
Figgins wants ya!

194
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,843
But we just started rehearsals.

195
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:22,210
My hands are tied, Schue.
I need the auditorium.

196
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:25,273
Alcoholics Anonymous wants to rent it out
for their afternoon meetings.

197
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,252
Lots of drunks in this town.
They're paying me 10 bucks a head.

198
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,413
If we show at Regionals, Glee stays.

199
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,423
If not, the bar is open in the auditorium.

200
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:35,517
What is it with you and this club?
You've got only five kids.

201
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:38,791
- One of them's a cripple!
- Then I guess you've got nothing to worry about.

202
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,795
- Fine.
- Yes!

203
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,634
But you're running detention
for free to make it up to me.

204
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,141
Deal.

205
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,409
You put your hands
in the corners like this.

206
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,917
- Okay?
- I can't do it.

207
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,612
I'm dyslexic.

208
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:04,781
Maybe I should just stick to
towels and washcloths.

209
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,883
Howard, if you can't fold a fitted sheet,
you cannot work at Sheets 'N' Things.

210
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,394
<i>Associate return.</i>

211
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:13,193
Go. Make sure they have a receipt.

212
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,969
Someone looks beautiful today. Hi.

213
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,164
- You look very handsome.
- Thank you.

214
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,305
- Roast beef on pumpernickel. Your favorite.
- Ohh!

215
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,605
- Oh, does it have mayo?
- Yeah.

216
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,579
Will, if my diabetes comes back,
I can't get pregnant.

217
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,774
- I...
- What is wrong with you?

218
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,784
Well, I wanted to tell you...

219
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:36,083
that I'm gonna have to start workin' late
for the next couple months.

220
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:38,919
- I'm, uh, monitoring after-school detention.
- What?

221
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:41,926
I had to make a deal with Figgins
so he wouldn't kill Glee Club.

222
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,986
But, Will, I'm on my feet four hours a day,
three times a week here.

223
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,658
Now I have to go home
and I have to cook dinner for myself?

224
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:50,827
This lady wants to return these sheets.

225
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,963
But something tells me
we've got another bed wetter.

226
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:59,033
Do you see what
I have to deal with here, hmm?

227
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,875
God, hasn't she ever heard of a diaper?

228
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:05,314
<i>Of course towels
have a thread count, Mr...</i>

229
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,511
Sheets 'N' Things!

230
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:10,680
<i>What do you do?
I read catalogs! I know these things.</i>

231
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:14,749
<i>Anything under a 400-thread count
and I could break out in impetigo!</i>

232
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:18,024
It's simple to understand! William?

233
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:20,031
Sandy? Hey!

234
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,727
Well, hello. How are things?

235
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,566
I hear you have taken over Glee Club.

236
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,471
Yeah. I hope you're not too upset.

237
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,009
Are you kidding? Getting out
of that swirling eddy of despair...

238
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,044
best thing that ever happened to me.

239
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,006
Don't get me wrong.
It wasn't easy at first.

240
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,984
Being dismissed.
And for what I was accused of?

241
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:44,580
My long-distance girlfriend
in Cleveland nearly broke up with me.

242
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,217
Oh, God. Don't you love a good monkey?

243
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:50,057
It took me weeks to get over
my nervous breakdown.

244
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,565
- Did they put you on medication?
- Better. Medical marijuana.

245
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,827
It's genius!

246
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,699
I just tell my Dr. Feelgood
I'm having trouble sleeping...

247
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,262
and he gives me all of it I want.

248
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,604
I'm finding the whole system
quite lucrative.

249
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:07,578
- You're a drug dealer?
- Oh, yeah. Make five times more
than when I was a teacher.

250
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:11,912
I keep some for myself
and then I take money baths in the rest.

251
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,679
Who-Who do you sell it to?

252
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:21,255
You want in?

253
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:23,261
Uh, no.
I tried it once in college.

254
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,263
But Terri and I are
trying to get pregnant.

255
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,561
- I do my own packaging.
- Sandy, no...

256
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,567
And the first sample is free. Come on.

257
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,695
You are the one coaching those tone-deaf
acne factories. You're gonna need it.

258
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:35,433
What? This looks like barf.

259
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,771
Okay? I have to do everything myself.

260
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,868
Call me. Come on.

261
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:43,642
What's the matter with you?
Scary.

262
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,277
<i>Hey, Sue. C-Can I have a sec?</i>

263
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,152
Sure, buddy. Come on in.

264
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,893
Eew!

265
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,792
Hey, Emma. You got a second?

266
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,836
- What is that? Gum?
- Uh-huh.

267
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,566
So you want to talk to my Cheerios
about joining Glee Club?

268
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,335
Well, I need more kids... Performers.

269
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,501
And all the best ones are in the Cheerios.

270
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,511
I figured some of them
might want to double up.

271
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,140
Okay. So what you're doing right now
is called blurring the lines.

272
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:20,674
High school is a caste system.
Kids fall into certain slots.

273
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,519
<i>Your jocks,
your popular kids, up in the penthouse.</i>

274
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:29,459
<i>The invisibles and the kids playing
live-action druids and trolls out in the forest...</i>

275
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,462
bottom floor.

276
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,589
And... where do the Glee kids lie?

277
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,793
Sub-basement.

278
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,701
Sue's not wrong.
But I don't think anything's set in stone.

279
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:43,037
I mean, kids are gonna do what they think
is cool, which is not always who they are.

280
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,441
- You just need to find a way to
get them out of their boxes.
- Well, how do I do that?

281
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:49,675
They follow the leader. If you can get
a couple of the popular kids to sign up...

282
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,443
the rest will fall right in line.

283
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:54,452
<i>- I just want to talk to them.
- I don't know, dude.</i>

284
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,182
I can't see any of my guys
wanting to join the Glee Club.

285
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,690
Last month, they held down one of their
teammates, shaved off his eyebrows...

286
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,692
<i>just because he watched Grey's Anatomy.</i>

287
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,389
- Look, all I'm looking for is an introduction.
- Fine.

288
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,558
You gotta put a good word
in for me with Emma.

289
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:14,034
- There you go, Cinderella.
- Thank you.

290
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:18,634
I have trouble with things like that.
The, um... The messy things.

291
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,679
Yeah.

292
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,839
It's really nice
how much you care about Glee.

293
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:25,042
About the kids.

294
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:28,245
If you really care about these kids,
you'll leave well enough alone.

295
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,185
Children like to know where they stand.

296
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:33,156
So let your little Glee kids
have their little club.

297
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:36,991
But don't pretend that any of them
are something they're not.

298
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,733
Circle up!

299
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:48,102
Now Mr. Schuester is gonna talk to you.

300
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:52,576
<i>You don't listen, you do laps.
You mouth off, you do laps.</i>

301
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,908
<i>Got it? They're all yours, Will.</i>

302
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,005
Thanks, Ken. Hey, guys.
How you doing?

303
00:16:57,082 --> 00:17:01,576
<i>I think I recognize some of you
from Spanish class. But, uh, I'm...</i>

304
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:04,679
I'm here today to talk to you
about something different. Uh, music.

305
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,888
Glee Club needs guys.

306
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,897
I can sing.

307
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:15,024
<i>Really? That's fantastic.</i>

308
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,432
- You wanna hear?
- Yeah.

309
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,277
Oh, yeah!

310
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,249
Laps.

311
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:40,417
I'm gonna put the sign-up sheet at the door.
So if anyone wants to sign up, please...

312
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,653
Thank you.

313
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,060
<i>Dismissed!
Puck, in my office in five minutes.</i>

314
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:51,093
You been sleeping okay?
Your eyes look a little bloodshot.

315
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,661
I got allergies.

316
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,004
Okay, buddy. Thanks again.

317
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,110
<i>I honestly thought
that was the end of the very brief...</i>

318
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,812

319

they didn't even know they had.</i>

327
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,883
¶¶ And I can't fight this feelin' anymore ¶¶

328
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,856
<i>It was pure talent.</i>

329
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:48,188
¶¶ If I have to crawl upon your floor ¶¶

330
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,058
¶¶ Come crashing through your door ¶¶

331
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,896
<i>¶¶ Baby, I can't fight this feelin' anymore ¶¶¶¶</i>

332
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:59,666
<i>What I did then was
the blackest moment of my life.</i>

333
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,532
You want to tell me
how long you've had a drug problem?

334
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,578
I don't even know who the chronic lady is.

335
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,638
Look, if it were up to me, we wouldn't
have mandatory biweekly locker checks.

336
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,684
But I've never seen that before, Mr. Schue.
I swear. It's not mine!

337
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,844
I'll pee in a cup!

338
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,753
- I'll pee.
- Look, it wouldn't make any difference.

339
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,519
<i>Possession is eight-tenths of the law.</i>

340
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:24,528
<i>I'm pretty sure that much pot
is a felony. Yeah.</i>

341
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,757
Look, you'll get kicked out of school.

342
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,356
You'll lose your football scholarship.

343
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:31,402
Wait, I...
I had a football scholarship? To-To where?

344
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,064
<i>- You could land in prison, son.
- Oh, my God.</i>

345
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:37,233
Please, don't tell my mom.

346
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:41,507
Look, I see a lot of myself in you, Finn.

347
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,983
I know what it's like to struggle
to make good life choices.

348
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:49,384
And I don't want to see you throw away
everything you have to offer the world.

349
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,458
I just expected more out of you, Finn.

350
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,461
<i>That really got to me
when Mr. Schuester said that.</i>

351
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:01,363
<i>Because every day of my life,
I expect more out of myself.</i>

352
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,367
<i>See, I might look confident
and everything.</i>

353
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:07,599
<i>But I really struggle with the same thing
other kids do. Peer pressure, backne.</i>

354
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:15,411
<i>I never knew my dad. He died in Iraq when we
were fighting Osama bin Laden the first time.</i>

355
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,083
Hold on, hold on.
Finn! Finn! Finn!

356
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,085
<i>Please! I'm on the phone.</i>

357
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:24,088
<i>I just want to trade
next Saturday's shift for this Saturday...</i>

358
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,919
<i>because Finn's got
a parents' night for Cub Scouts.</i>

359
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:28,391
<i>My mom and me, we're real close.</i>

360
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,394
<i>But being a single parent can be hard.</i>

361
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:35,661
<i>The only good time for Mom was when we
splurged a little bit and ordered Emerald Dreams.</i>

362
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,725
<i>Darren was good to her.</i>

363
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,964
<i>And he was cool about letting me hang out.</i>

364
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:46,070
¶¶ You make me weep ¶¶

365
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,815
<i>¶¶ And wanna die ¶¶</i>

366
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:54,841
<i>- ¶¶ Just when... ¶¶
- That was the first time I really "heard" music.</i>

367
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,854
¶¶ You said we'd try ¶¶

368
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:00,153
¶¶ Lovin' , touchin' ¶¶

369
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:04,821
<i>- ¶¶ Squeezin' ¶¶
- Man, it set my soul on fire.</i>

370
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:07,262
¶¶ Each other ¶¶

371
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:10,165
You got a voice, buddy.

372
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:14,035
Seriously, if I had that voice,
my band would still be together.

373
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,704
Stick with it!

374
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:22,372
<i>My mom took it real hard when Darren
left her for that girl he met at Pic'N'Save.</i>

375
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,109
<i>¶¶ With someone else ¶¶</i>

376
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:29,711
<i>¶¶ Lovin' , touchin' , squeezin' ¶¶</i>

377
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,725
<i>¶¶ Each other ¶¶</i>

378
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:38,661
<i>¶¶ Now it's your turn, girl, to cry ¶¶</i>

379
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,893
<i>¶¶ Na, na, na-na-na-na ¶¶</i>

380
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:46,028
<i>It was at that moment I decided to do
whatever it took to make my mom proud of me...</i>

381
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:48,902
<i>make her feel
all her sacrifice was worth it.</i>

382
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,839
<i>We have two options here.</i>

383
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:54,436
I'm running detention now,
so you can do six weeks after school.

384
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,539
But that's gonna remain
on your permanent record.

385
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,116
What's the other option, Mr. Schue?

386
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:08,416
¶¶ I got chills
They're multiplyin' ¶¶

387
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:12,156
<i>¶¶ And I'm losin' control ¶¶</i>

388
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:17,429
¶¶ 'Cause the power you're supplyin' ¶¶

389
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,129
¶¶ It's electrifyin' ¶¶

390
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:21,263
- ¶¶ You better shape up ¶¶
- ¶¶ Doo, doo, doo ¶¶

391
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,673
- ¶¶ 'Cause I need a man ¶¶
- ¶¶ Doo, doo, doo ¶¶

392
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,940
- ¶¶ But my heart is set on you ¶¶
- ¶¶ And my heart is set on you ¶¶

393
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:32,382
¶¶ You better shape up
You better understand ¶¶

394
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,352
¶¶ To my heart I must be true ¶¶

395
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,413
- ¶¶ Nothin' left ¶¶
- ¶¶ Nothin' left for me to do ¶¶

396
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:43,757
- ¶¶ You're the one that I want ¶¶
- ¶¶ You are the one I want, ooh, ooh, ooh, honey ¶¶

397
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:46,525
- ¶¶ The one that I want ¶¶¶¶
- Oh, hell to the no!

398
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:49,328
Look, I'm not down with this
background singing nonsense!

399
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,801
I'm Beyoncé!
I ain't no Kelly Rowland.

400
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,464
Okay, look, Mercedes.
It's just one song.

401
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,905
And it's the first time
we've been kind of good.

402
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:01,601
Okay. You're good, white boy.
I'll give you that.

403
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,945
But you better bring it.
Let's run it again.

404
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:07,541
All right. Let's do it. From the top.

405
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,619
You usually don't let me
in your craft room.

406
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,455
Isn't this fun? And challenging?

407
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:17,461
Every Wednesday
we're gonna have puzzle night...

408
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:20,965
because I know how important
it is for you to have a creative outlet.

409
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:26,737
You know,
the kids have been working so hard.

410
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:29,740
I was thinking about taking them
on a field trip next Saturday.

411
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,901
Carmel High's performing
a showcase down in Akron.

412
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:34,241
<i>Carmel's gonna be the team
to beat at Regionals...</i>

413
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:37,645
and I was wondering if you might
want to come chaperone with me.

414
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:41,447
- On Saturday? Oh, I can't.
- Oh.

415
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,853
I had to pick up an extra shift at work,
Will. We're living paycheck to paycheck.

416
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,915
How much of that paycheck
goes to your Pottery Barn credit card?

417
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:51,019
I don't know what you're talking about.

418
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,458
Don't go in the Christmas closet!

419
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:56,433
I was looking for my jacket
the other day. Come on!

420
00:23:56,501 --> 00:24:00,335
- We cannot afford this stuff, Terri!
- But we could, Will!

421
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:04,307
Yes, I am a shoo-in to be promoted during
the Christmas week at Sheets 'N' Things!

422
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:08,142
I reek of management potential!
And they're hiring at H.W. Menken!

423
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:11,808
My passion is teaching, Terri!
For the last time, I don't want to be an accountant!

424
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:16,217
Dr. Phil said people could change.
It's not a bad thing to want a real life, Will.

425
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,756
And to have a glue gun that works!

426
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:25,995
You know, it's really hard
for me not having the things that I need.

427
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:29,556
<i>Oh! And you need three
mahogany toilet brush holders?</i>

428
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,693
They're Balinese!

429
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:36,230
It is not a bad thing
to want things, Will.

430
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:40,036
I understand your interest
in these kids, Will.

431
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,705
I really do. Yeah.

432
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:45,909
It's your way of
recapturing your glory days.

433
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,145
But I'm not
the high school cheerleader anymore...

434
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,154
and you are not the golden boy.

435
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:53,350
High school's over for both of us.

436
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,260
It's time that you move on.

437
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,069
<i>You're the quarterback!</i>

438
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:49,705
- Coach, it's temporary...
- No! I don't want to hear it!

439
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:52,375
<i>You make a decision.
Either you're a football player or you're a singer!</i>

440
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,085
<i>Hey, what's going on?</i>

441
00:25:57,155 --> 00:26:00,318
Oh, it's... I just... I have to miss
practice Saturday afternoon.

442
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:04,328
It's, uh, my mom.
I gotta help her cook and, uh, do things.

443
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,330
Why?

444
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,332
She just had, uh, surgery.

445
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,334
What kind of surgery?

446
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:14,065
Uh, well, she, uh, had to
have her prostate out.

447
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,073
Man, that's a tough break.

448
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,132
Yeah. It's, uh, engorged.

449
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:22,578
You think this is hard?
I'm living with hepatitis. That's hard!

450
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,513
You stole my quarterback.

451
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,680
Okay, look, Finn's got a great voice.

452
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,689
He just wants to express himself.

453
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:36,454
- You're screwing up my life.
- Okay, Ken? You hate football.

454
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,723
<i>What's this really about?</i>

455
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,161
Hey, M&M.

456
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:45,691
So, I got tickets
to monster trucks this weekend.

457
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,671
- Loge tickets.
- No, thanks. Not my thing.

458
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,608
Truckzilla vs. Truckosaurus.
And get this... the trucks breathe fire.

459
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:56,511
Ken, look, you know how every time you ask
me out, I tell you I'm on my period?

460
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:59,641
- Which doesn't bother me.
- Or I tell you I'm suffering from cluster headaches.

461
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,709
Or I'm allergic to nighttime.

462
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,845
Those things? Not really true.

463
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:06,618
- I'm just not interested in dating you...
- Shh.

464
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,287
How do I get you... into my hatchback?

465
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:14,332
Okay, Ken, fine. Make me say it.
I like somebody else.

466
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:18,836
Nothing I can do about it because they're
unavailable, so I have to deal with that, but...

467
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,576
You're right. I'm overreacting.

468
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,136
- The herd will take care of it.
- The herd?

469
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:30,977
The student body.

470
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:34,883
The second someone tries to rise above,
be different, herd pulls 'em back in.

471
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:37,217
So... Oh, and by the way...

472
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:40,815
<i>thanks for putting a good word
in for me with Emma, buddy.</i>

473
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:43,690
I guess you just want her
for yourself, huh?

474
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,596
Adios, amigo.

475
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:55,205
- You're very talented.
- Really?

476
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,207
Yeah.

477
00:27:57,275 --> 00:28:00,073
I would know. I'm very talented too.

478
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:04,574
I think the rest of the team
expects us to become an item.

479
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:06,583
You, the hot male lead...

480
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:10,348
and me, the stunning young ingénue
everyone roots for.

481
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:13,220
Well, I, uh, have a girlfriend.

482
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,725
Really? Who?

483
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:17,728
Quinn Fabray.

484
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:19,730
Cheerleader Quinn Fabray?

485
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,925
The president of the celibacy club?

486
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,137
Wait.

487
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:38,945
Let's pray.

488
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,747
<i>¶¶ Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no ¶¶</i>

489
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,253
For almost four months now.
She's cool.

490
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:48,486
I wonder if they have Sour Patch Kids.

491
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,795
Those kielbasas look like
they've been there a while.

492
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,799
Do you want to go halfsies on a P.B. and J?

493
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:57,494
- That sounds perfect.
- Yeah?

494
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,196
Yeah. Let's go.

495
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,135
Sorry. Excuse me.

496
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:05,506
I haven't had a peanut butter and jelly
sandwich in... a really long time.

497
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,875
- Really?
- Yeah. My wife's allergic to nuts.

498
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:10,972
Oh. Oh.
Well, that's really sweet though.

499
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,983
Not eating something because she can't.

500
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,609
- Oh. Yeah.
- It's very nice.

501
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:16,620
Oh, that's really noisy.

502
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:18,349
But they're clean.

503
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,152
- Oh, my gosh.
- There you go.

504
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:21,783
- How, um...
- Mmm.

505
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,555
How long have you two been married?

506
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:25,289
Mmm, five years last March.

507
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:26,955
- Really? Mmm.
- Yeah.

508
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:28,965
But we've been together since high school.

509
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:30,967
She was my first girlfriend, actually.

510
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,969
Was it love at first sight?

511
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:34,902
For me it was.

512
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:38,670
I don't know.
She used to be filled with so much joy.

513
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:40,938
And now?

514
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:43,947
Ah, showtime.

515
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:46,950
- You don't want to hear
about my marital problems.
- No, I do.

516
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:51,114
I do... I'd love to hear... You... I'm not happy
that you have marital problems.

517
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:54,625
- People talk to me a lot
because I'm a guidance counselor.
- Okay, here's the thing.

518
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:57,627
- Terri rides me hard,
and I've always appreciated it.
- Mm-hmm.

519
00:29:57,695 --> 00:30:00,630
I figure she just wants me
to be better, you know?

520
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:03,633
But lately, though,
I keep asking myself, better at what?

521
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:06,636
Making money? Being upwardly mobile?
Thank you.

522
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:09,639
I don't know. I love her.
Don't get me wrong.

523
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:12,642
- But we just gotta get back on the same page.
- Did you like the sandwich?

524
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,201
Oh, my God.
It's, like, the best I've ever had.

525
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,374
Hey, guys. So this is supposed
to be our "competition."

526
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:21,475
<i>But I honestly don't think that
they've got the talent that we've got.</i>

527
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:24,386
But let's be a good audience. Give them
some of that old McKinley High respect.

528
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,685
<i>Please give a warm
Buckeye State welcome...</i>

529
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:32,390
<i>to last year's regional champion,
Vocal Adrenaline!</i>

¶¶ But I won't go, go, go ¶¶¶¶

561
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,002
We're d-d-doomed.

562
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:42,388
<i>Chicks don't have prostates.</i>

563
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,985
I looked it up. You broke the rules.

564
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:47,327
For that, you must be punished.

565
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,029
Wait, wait, wait.

566
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,536
Wait, y-you've got the power here.

567
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:55,333
Y-You don't have to do this!

568
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,841
There's my baby.

569
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,450
Wow, honey.

570
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:14,013
This is amazing. What...
What's the congratulations for?

571
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:16,083
The kids haven't won anything yet.

572
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,153
I'm pregnant.

573
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,397
- Really?
- Yeah!

574
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,563
Terri, don't mess with me.

575
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:29,572
Oh, my God. This is amazing!

576
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,540
We're gonna be a family.

577
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:33,975
Oh, my God!

578
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:40,108
Oh, I can't believe it.

579
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:49,257
You're leaving us? When?

580
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,887
I've given my two-weeks notice.

581
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:54,864
But I promise I'm gonna find you guys
a great replacement before I go.

582
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:58,868
Is this 'cause those Carmel kids were so good?
Because we can work harder.

583
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:03,134
This isn't fair, Mr. Schuester.
We can't do this without you.

584
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:07,371
So does that mean that I don't have to be
in the club anymore, or...

585
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,643
Look, this isn't about you guys.

586
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:14,617
Being an adult is about
having to make difficult choices.

587
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:16,619
It's not like high school.

588
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:20,054
Sometimes you have to give up
the things that you love.

589
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:24,325
One day you guys are gonna grow up
and understand that.

590
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:30,330
I have... loved being your teacher.

591
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,487
¶¶ All my bags are packed ¶¶

592
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:26,352
¶¶ I'm ready to go ¶¶

593
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:28,221
¶¶ I'm standing here ¶¶

594
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,157
¶¶ Outside your door ¶¶

595
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:32,856
¶¶ I hate to wake you up ¶¶

596
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:36,957
¶¶ To say good-bye ¶¶

597
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:39,927
<i>¶¶ But the dawn is breakin' ¶¶</i>

598
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:42,063
<i>¶¶ It's early morn ¶¶</i>

599
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,801
<i>¶¶ A taxi's waiting ¶¶</i>

600
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,672
<i>¶¶ He's blowing his horn ¶¶</i>

601
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:48,974
<i>¶¶ Already I'm so lonesome ¶¶</i>

602
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:52,880
<i>¶¶ I could die ¶¶</i>

603
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,214
<i>¶¶ So kiss me ¶¶</i>

604
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:58,847
<i>¶¶ And smile for me ¶¶</i>

605
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:01,391
¶¶ Tell me that you'll wait for me ¶¶

606
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:04,724
<i>¶¶ Hold me like you'll never ¶¶</i>

607
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:09,129
<i>¶¶ Let me go ¶¶</i>

608
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,725
¶¶ 'Cause I'm leaving ¶¶

609
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:14,430
¶¶ On a jet plane ¶¶

610
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:18,737
<i>¶¶ Don't know when I'll be back again ¶¶</i>

611
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:20,606
<i>¶¶ Oh, babe ¶¶</i>

612
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:25,081
<i>¶¶ I hate to go ¶¶</i>

613
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:27,811
<i>¶¶ But I'm leaving ¶¶</i>

614
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:30,945
<i>¶¶ On a jet plane ¶¶</i>

615
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:34,924
¶¶ Don't know when I'll be back again ¶¶

616
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:38,291
¶¶ Oh, babe ¶¶

617
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,388
<i>- ¶¶ I hate to go ¶¶¶¶
- I heard he's having a baby.</i>

618
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:44,093
That's why he gave Figgins his notice.

619
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:46,159
Really?

620
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:13,120
<i>Need help grading those papers?</i>

621
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:16,928
It's actually an application
for H.W. Menken. They're hiring.

622
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:21,166
Come on. Accounting is sexy.

623
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:27,934
I'll miss you.

624
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,640
- Before you leave, can you do me a favor?
- Yeah.

625
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:34,242
I made an appointment for you tomorrow...
in the career center.

626
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:36,809
You need some guidance.

627
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:38,855
I'm having a kid, Emma.

628
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,914
What I need is better benefits.

629
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,517
Just come, Will, for me.

630
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:54,360
- Didn't see you at Glee Club today.
- Is that still happening?

631
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,962
- I've taken over.
- Oh.

632
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,531
I'm interim director, but I expect
the position will become permanent.

633
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,804
- Hi, Finn. RuPaul.
- Hey.

634
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:04,041
- What are you doing talking to her?
- Oh...

635
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:07,778
Science project. We're partners.

636
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:09,843
Christ Crusaders tonight
at 5:00, my house.

637
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,013
Sounds great.

638
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:16,152
Look, I should go.

639
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:18,286
I can't do Glee anymore.
It conflicts with...

640
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:20,330
Your reputation?

641
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:23,299
You've really got something, Finn,
and you're throwing it away.

642
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:26,700
- I-I'm gonna be late.
- You can't keep worrying about what people think.

643
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:29,696
You're better than all of them.

644
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:38,744
What do you want me to do, apologize?

645
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,807
That's not me, dude.

646
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:46,685
Look, if I joined the flag team,
you'd beat the crap out of me.

647
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:48,748
I just don't understand why you did it.

648
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:52,318
Schuester told me he'd give me enough
extra credit to pass Spanish if I joined the club.

649
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:55,695
I didn't have a choice. If I failed
another class, I'd be off the team.

650
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:59,497
Look, it's over. Okay?
I quit. Anything else?

651
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,504
No, that's it.

652
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:06,032
And as a welcome back to the world
of the normal, I got you a present.

653
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:09,705
What's that noise?

654
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,408
Oh, God! Help! Help!

655
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,918
<i>- Help!
- Is someone in there?</i>

656
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:19,217
We got that wheelchair kid inside.
We're gonna flip it.

657
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,917
Isn't that kind of dangerous?

658
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:22,788
He's already in a wheelchair.

659
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,454
Come on, dude.
We saved you the first roll.

660
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:30,599
Oh!

661
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:33,034
Thank you. Thank you so much.

662
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:36,772
Thank you.
Oh, my God. The smell.

663
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:39,969
What the hell, dude?
I can't believe you're helping out this loser.

664
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:43,775
Don't you get it, man?
We're all losers.

665
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,645
<i>Everyone in this school.</i>

666
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:48,412
Hell, everyone in this town.

667
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:51,478
Out of all the kids who graduate,
maybe half will go to college.

668
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:54,217
And... And two will leave
the state to do it.

669
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:58,489
I'm not afraid of being called a loser,
'cause I can accept that that's what I am.

670
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:02,231
But I am afraid
of turning my back on something...

671
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:05,132
that actually made me happy
for the first time in my sorry life.

672
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:08,296
So, what? Are you quitting
to join Homo Explosion?

673
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:10,806
No. I'm doing both.

674
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:13,969
<i>'Cause you can't win without me,
and neither can they.</i>

675
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:23,144
<i>- Go, go!
- Track, track, track, Ronnie.</i>

681
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,878
Look, you guys.
These steps are not hard.

682
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,777
I've been doing them since preschool.

683
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:53,544
I'm sorry. Did I miss the election for queen?
Because I didn't vote for you.

684
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:57,644
I know what I'm talking about. I won my first
dance competition when I was three months old!

685
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:03,318
- This is a closed rehearsal.
- Look, I owe you guys an apology.

686
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:06,727
I never should've quit.

687
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:10,130
I don't want to be the guy that just
drives around throwing eggs at people.

688
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:13,193
- That was you?
- You and your friends threw pee balloons at me.

689
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,534
- I know.
- You nailed all my lawn furniture to my roof.

690
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:18,666
I wasn't actually there for that,
but I'm really sorry.

691
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:22,007
Look, that isn't who I am,
and I'm tired of it.

692
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,048
This is what I want to be doing,
with you guys.

693
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:28,414
I used to think that this was,
like, the lamest thing on earth...

694
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,647
and maybe it is.

695
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:33,315
But we're all here for the same reason...

696
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,756
'cause we want to be good at something.

697
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:40,022
Artie, you play guitar, right?

698
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:43,225
- Think you could recruit the jazz band?
- I do have pull there.

699
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,234
All right.

700
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:48,738
<i>Mercedes, we need new costumes, and
they have got to be cool. Can you do that?</i>

701
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:51,036
Damn! Don't you see what I've got on?

702
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:53,906
Rachel, you can do choreography.

703
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:56,845
<i>Tina, what are you good at?</i>

704
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:59,781
- Uh... Uh...
- We'll figure something out for you.

705
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,284
And what are you bringing to the table,
Justin Timberlake?

706
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:05,822
I've got the music.

707
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,721
I want to show you something.

708
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:18,958
I did a little research.

709
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:25,406
And this is a tape I found in the library
of the '93 team at Nationals.

710
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:27,637
Let's dance!

711
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,716
<i>- ¶¶ Ah, that's the way, uh-huh, uh-huh ¶¶
- Do you know who that is?</i>

712
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:37,617
¶¶ I like it, uh-huh, uh-huh ¶¶

713
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:39,952
<i>- ¶¶ That's the way, uh-huh, uh-huh ¶¶
- That's you, Will.</i>

714
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:42,686
<i>¶¶ I like it, uh-huh, uh-huh
When you take me by the hand ¶¶</i>

715
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,126
That's you happier
than I've ever seen you.

716
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:47,026
¶¶ And tell me I'm your loving man ¶¶¶¶

717
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:49,827
That was the greatest moment of my life.

718
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,563
- Why?
- Because I loved what I was doing.

719
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:57,767
Yeah, I knew before we were halfway through
with that number that we were gonna win.

720
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:06,539
And being a part of that,
in that moment...

721
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,511
I knew who I was in the world.

722
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:23,294
And the only time I felt...
I felt that way since then...

723
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:26,336
was when Terri told me
I was gonna be a father.

724
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:34,369
No. No.
I need to provide for my family.

725
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,777
But provide what exactly?

726
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:39,873
The understanding that money
is the most important thing?

727
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:43,750
Or the idea that the only life
worth living...

728
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:46,483
is one that you're really
passionate about, Will?

We need a 10.
Rachel, you need to hit the ones and the fives.

772
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:17,165
Finn, I think if we worked on it,
you could hit a high "B."

773
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:19,099
So does this mean you're staying?

774
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:24,034

win Nationals without me.
