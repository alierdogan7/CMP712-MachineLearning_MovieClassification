Oh! Sofia, there you are!

20
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:27,619
You have to come out
to the terrace this instant.

21
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:29,054
I'll be right there.

22
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:30,355
I'm almost done
with this story.

23
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:33,092
Finish it later.
Come on!

24
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:34,593
What's so important?

25
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,862
You'll see.
( giggles )

26
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:38,931
Hello, ladies.

27
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,365
Dad, are we there yet?

28
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:41,633
We sure are.

29
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:44,169
Welcome to merroway cove!

30
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:55,347
Rollie, it's beautiful.

31
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,015
It's just as I remember it.

32
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:59,284
My father brought me
here when I was a boy.

33
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,352
Remember, baileywick?

34
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:02,087
All too well, your majesty.

35
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:03,188
Are you okay, baileywick?

36
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,857
Yes, sofia.

37
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:07,926
I'm just getting used
to being on the water.

38
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:10,662
What a perfect place to spend
our summer vacation.

39
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,865
Daddy, isn't merroway cove
where the mermaids live?

40
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:14,666
Mermaids?

41
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:17,936
I'm afraid those stories
are just old fisherman's tales.

42
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:20,305
Last time I was here,
I didn't see any mermaids.

43
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,974
And I looked,
right baileywick?

44
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:23,108
You did indeed.

45
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,676
Maybe they stayed underwater.

46
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:26,278
I'm reading a book about
mermaids right now,

47
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,846
And it says a lot of times

48
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,214
They only come up to the surface

49
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:31,016
When they know humans
aren't looking.

50
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:32,117
Nonsense!

51
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,318
Admiral hornpipe!

52
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,754
I have sailed the 17 seas,

53
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:38,090
And seen all manner
of creatures,

54
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:40,125
But not one single mermaid.

55
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:41,793
The truth of
the matter is,

56
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,996
There is no truth
to the matter.

57
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,665
Mermaids are not real.

58
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,267
But it says so in the book.

59
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:50,302
Not all stories
are true, sofia.

60
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:53,405
Right. Now who wants to go up
to the wheelhouse

61
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:56,141
And help me sail across
this lovely cove?

62
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:57,442
Both:
I do! I do!

63
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:00,012
Well, off course you do.
Tally-ho!

64
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:02,080
Come along, everyone.

65
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:03,682
( sighs )

66
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,218
Lunch is now being
served on the lido deck.

67
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,755
Mmm. Blueberries
a la clover!
Huh?

68
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:10,689
Clover!

69
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,191
Hey, princess!

70
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:15,160
You're suipposed to be
back at the castle.

71
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:16,762
Surprise!

72
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:19,698
Stay there.
I'm coming down.

73
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:25,337
The princess may
be on vacation,

74
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:28,373
But there's no rest for
the wicked, wormy.

75
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,042
Not when there's
a kingdom to take over.

76
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:31,777
( caws )

77
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:34,279
And we won't even need
princess sofia's amulet

78
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,315
To do it.

79
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:40,018
Because I found another way.

80
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,422
The mermaid comb
of merroway cove.

81
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:47,092
The mermaids that live
in the bottom of this cove

82
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:49,261
Have a magical comb
that can harness

83
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:53,966
The power of the ocean
like this!

84
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:56,768
Ooh, if I can get my
hands on that comb,

85
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,038
The entire kingdom
will bow at my feet.

86
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,474
Stop lounging around, wormy.

87
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:07,412
It's time to go fishing
for mermaids.

88
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,782
So how'd you get on board?

89
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:12,818
Well, I was taking a nap
in one of the boxes

90
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,920
In the castle kitchen,
when I woke up, I was here.

91
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,488
Oops.

92
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:20,359
But that's cool,
'cause I could
use a vacation.

93
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:22,160
I could see it now.

94
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:25,097
Lying on a beach,
sipping on a coconut...

95
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,498
( gasps )
did you see that?

96
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,033
See what?

97
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,338
Let's look from
the swimming platform.

98
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,874
Look for what?
Sofia?

99
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:41,880
Huh?

100
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,485
( sighs )

101
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:47,786
What're you looking for?

102
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,321
I thought I saw...

103
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:50,455
Saw what?

104
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,824
Uh, a mermaid.

105
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:55,327
Ha! Mermaid.

106
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:57,496
Oh, you're serious.
I'm sorry.

107
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:59,464
It's okay.
( sighs )

108
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,932
I guess they
are just stories.

109
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:02,067
Both: Huh?!?

110
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:04,870
( gasps )

111
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:05,837
What was that?

112
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,306
A mermaid!

113
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:09,574
Where'd she go?

114
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:12,911
( gasps )

115
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,813
( gasps )

116
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,285
Oh!

117
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:22,020
Be careful, princess!

118
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,823
Stop! You're just getting
yourself more tangled.

119
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,158
Here! Take my hand.

120
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,130
Hold still.

121
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,837
Thank you.

122
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,239
You're welcome.
My name is sofia.
What's yours?

123
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:42,107
I'm oona.

124
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:43,575
You're a mermaid.

125
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:46,044
Yeah, I am.

126
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:47,346
And I'm clover.

127
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:48,914
Hello, clover.
What're you?

128
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,583
I'm a blue ribbon
bunny, baby.

129
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:53,852
Oh! Mermaids can talk
to animals?

130
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,554
Of course.
Can't humans?

131
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:57,022
Not usually.

132
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:00,425
This is some boat you have.

133
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,160
It's a floating palace.

134
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,062
I saw it enter the cove.

135
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:07,966
I've never seen
anything like it.

136
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:11,069
Does your necklace
always glow like that?

137
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:14,272
Oh! It only glows
once in a while.

138
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:15,374
It's enchanted.

139
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:17,576
Hey! So's my comb!
Really?

140
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:19,311
At least that's
what my mom says.

141
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:21,179
But she won't tell me
what it's powers are,

142
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:23,949
'cause she says
I'm not old enough yet.

143
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:26,451
Oh, I'd better go.
Why?

144
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:29,121
We're not supposed to spend
too much time at the surface.

145
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:31,556
Well, it was nice
meeting you, sofia.

146
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,525
Wait! Don't go.

147
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:35,260
Ow!
What's wrong?

148
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:38,630
I can't swim. I must've
hurt my fin in the net.

149
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:40,465
I'll help you.

150
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:43,001
Oh, whoa, whoa!

151
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:45,504
Here, take my hand.

152
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:49,608
( gasps )

153
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,476
Uh, sofia?

154
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:54,045
Your legs are going away.

155
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:57,182
What's happening?

156
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,658
Sofia! How'd you do that?

157
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,694
With each deed performed for
better or worse,

158
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:12,664
A power is granted,
a blessing or curse.

159
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,499
My amulet gives
me special powers

160
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:15,500
When I do good things.

161
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,202
I helped you out of the net.

162
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:20,672
So the amulet gave me the power
to transform into a mermaid.

163
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,541
Do you know what that means?
What?

164
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:25,477
I can swim in the water
like a mermaid!

165
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,380
Sofia!
Sofia?

166
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:34,019
This is incredible!

167
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,333
Ah!

168
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:51,136
I can't believe your amulet
turned you into a mermaid.

169
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,104
Now I can help you back
to the platform.

170
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,506
But I need to get home.

171
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:57,609
No. Just at the bottom
of the cove.

172
00:07:57,611 --> 00:08:00,545
Great. Clover?
I'll be back soon.

173
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,314
I'm going to see where
the mermaids live.

174
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:05,517
Okay, have fun.
Wait! You're going where?

175
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:14,392
Pardon me, 'scuse me, pardon me.

176
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:17,729
Sorry. Still getting
used to the tail.

177
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:23,401
Man, this is one
strange vacation.

178
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:28,773
Hey! That's my lunch!

179
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:33,245
Finders keepers, bunny!
( laughs )

180
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:36,114
Oh, you won't be keeping
it for long, seagull.

181
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:38,517
( laughs )

182
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,487
Right, we'll just
borrow this lifeboat

183
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:45,524
And find a nice, private
hding place

184
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:51,096
Where no precocious prinsesses
will get in our way.

185
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:52,697
Oh, wormy.

186
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:58,203
This cave will be the perfect
spot to hatch our scheme.

187
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,176
Now, let's find that spell.

188
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,779
We are going to transform
ourselves

189
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:10,415
Into the most magnificent
sea creatures.

190
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,817
Then we can dive straight
to the bottom of the cove

191
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:15,186
And find that mermaid comb.

192
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:18,089
Where is it?
Where is it?

193
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:21,560
Aha! There!
( clears throat )

194
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:25,397
Air to water, land to sea,

195
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:29,134
Actuus gillen maritee!

196
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,287
( laughs )
it worked!

197
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,122
( gurgles )

198
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:52,857
Oh, relax, wormy.

199
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:56,561
This way, we'll blend in with
the other sea life.

200
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:57,662
Wow, you guys sure stick out.

201
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:59,197
New around here, eh?

202
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:01,399
Oh, love the clown mask.
Very funny.

203
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:04,302
( fish laughing )

204
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:06,304
Ooh, everyone's a critic.

205
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:09,507
No matter.
( laughs )

206
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,776
Soon the mermaid comb
will be ours

207
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:16,348
And then the entire kingdom.

208
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:20,485
Off we go, wormy!
( laughs )

209
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,155
That way, sofia.
Throughh the kelp forest.

210
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:26,591
It looks just
like seaweed, oona.

211
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:29,594
That's because
kelp is seaweed.

212
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:33,465
Wow, it's like a whole
new world under the sea.

213
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,532
Is it much farther?

214
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:37,569
Down there.
Just past this ledge.

215
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,506
Oh, wow.

216
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,178
Here we are.

217
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,647
Let's go inside.

218
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,615
In the ship?
Uh-huh.

219
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,318
Whoa. It's all broken up.

220
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,354
Is this where
you live, oona?

221
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:59,357
No, this is my hideaway.

222
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:03,395
It's where I keep
all my treasures.

223
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:07,666
Oona? Oona, are you back?
Aw.

224
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,501
Quick! Hide over here!

225
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:10,669
Why?
That's sven.

226
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,203
He's my friend,

227
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:15,206
But he gets very suspicious
around strangers.

228
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,242
Maybe she's in her shipwreck.

229
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:20,211
Oona? Oona?
There you are.

230
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:21,746
Oh, hi, sven.

231
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:24,749
Where have you been?
And who is this?

232
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:27,519
I have not seen you
in the cove before.

233
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:28,853
No.
( giggles )

234
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:32,223
She's, uh, visiting
from another colony.

235
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:33,925
I hurt my fin and she
helped me get back.

236
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:36,361
( gasps )
oona! You hurt your fin?

237
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,729
You must see the doctor
immediately.

238
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:39,597
See the doctor about what?

239
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:40,699
Oona hurt her fin!

240
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,234
Sven, relax.

241
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,402
Let's have a look.

242
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,705
Oh, all you need
is a little moon kelp.

243
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,573
Ooh! I'll get it!

244
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:49,474
Who's your friend?

245
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:50,875
Oh, this is sofia.

246
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,944
Sofia, this is cora,
my sister.

247
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,245
Big sister.

248
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:55,547
Pleased to meet you.

249
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:56,915
Here's the moon kelp.

250
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:59,451
I'll take that.

251
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:01,419
I can do it myself, cora.

252
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:04,055
It needs to be
put on just right.

253
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,857
There. How does that feel?

254
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,527
Good.

255
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,429
You really should be
more careful, oona.

256
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,264
I am careful.

257
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,466
What're you doing here anyway?

258
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:16,434
Mom qwanted me
to check on you.

259
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:20,305
I'm fine, cora.
I'm always fine.

260
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:22,474
Just checking.

261
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,446
Cora still treats me like
a little mer-baby.

262
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,982
That's what big sisters do.
I have 12.

263
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:35,353
So if this is your hideaway...

264
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:36,821
Where do the rest
of the mermaids live?

265
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:39,524
Oona hasn't shown
you the cove yet?

266
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:40,959
Oona, where are
your manners?

267
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,994
Let's show our guest around.
Give her a tour.

268
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,462
A tour?

269
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:47,398
Welcome to your
personal tour

That's me.

272
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:55,673
Our tour begins right here
in oona's lovely shipwreck.

273
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,542
Hideaway.

( gasps )
wormy!

317
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:14,045
It's the mermaid comb!

318
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:16,581
So, do you wanna
see my castle?

319
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,882
I'd love to.

320
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:21,119
Is that who I think it is?

321
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:23,955
It's amazing.

322
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:26,524
Oh, it's the princess,
all right.

323
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:29,427
I don't know how she turned
herself into a mermaid,

324
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,529
But I will not
let her stop me

325
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:34,465
From getting that magical
mermaid comb!

326
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:35,500
Huh?

327
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,838
Why is it getting so dark?

328
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,440
What is that?

329
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,574
Your floating palace.

330
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,511
Look out!
Oop!

331
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:52,483
Oona. Mom wants us back
at the castlle.

332
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:53,851
But cora--
now.

333
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,954
Hurry.
I have to go, sofia.

334
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,989
Maybe I'll see you later?

335
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,230
What's going on, cora.
Why does she want to see us?

336
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,499
You'll find out
when we get there.

337
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:11,769
No one ever tells
me anything.

338
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,539
The ship has stopped,
your majesty,

339
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,708
But they haven't cast
any nets yet.

340
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,010
Oh, thank goodness.
You're both safe.

341
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:20,745
Why wouldn't we be?

342
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:23,147
A human vessel
is in the cove.

343
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:26,150
Oh, mom. It's not like humans
are dangerous or anything.

344
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,518
Yes, they are.

345
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,219
No, they're not.

346
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,787
Who are you?

347
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,589
I'm sofia.
What's your name?

348
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:34,025
I'm plank. The senior
advisor to the queen.

349
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:35,593
Are you from this colony?

350
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,495
Sofia's my new friend.

351
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,629
Hi.

352
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:40,765
Well, you and oona
are too young

353
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:42,600
To know what humans
are capable of.

354
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:45,236
The last time a ship
entered the cove,

355
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:47,205
Years before you were born,

356
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,974
A few mermaids were playing
near the rocks at the surface.

357
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:52,944
The humans tried
to capture one of us.

358
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:54,812
Luckily,
a storm came

359
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:57,148
And sank the
ship before anyone was caught.

360
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,984
Is that the shipwreck
that oona always plays in?

361
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:02,020
She prefers
the term hideaway.

362
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,788
Yes, the very one.

363
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,190
But many of our
people were hurt.

364
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,627
This is the reason we avoid
going up to the surface, oona.

365
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:12,697
If the humans in that ship
discover we're down here,

366
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,766
We could all be in grave danger.

367
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:16,200
But they don't mean any harm.

368
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:20,071
Queen emmaline, there is
only one course of action.

369
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:21,973
We must remove
the ship from our cove.

370
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:23,274
No!
You can't do that!

371
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:25,943
It sounds like we have to.
But how?

372
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,111
With the queen's trident.

373
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:28,846
It has the power
to change the weather.

374
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,615
Your majesty,
you could whip up a storm

375
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:32,583
That blows the ship
right out of the cove.

376
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:34,986
Sounds a little drastic, plank,
don't you think?

377
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:39,090
But a storm is a hard
thing to control, plank.

378
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:41,959
If it grows too large,
it could sink the ship.

379
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:43,027
Then so be it.

380
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:44,328
No!
Easy now, big fella.

381
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,830
What's the matter?
You wake up

382
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:47,698
On the wrong side
of the sea bed this morning?

383
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,300
There has to be
another way.

384
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:51,202
Do you have a better idea?

385
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:58,576
Yes. I could get the humans
to move the ship on their own.

386
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,178
And how could you do that?

387
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:04,615
Because its' my ship.
Well, my dad's ship.

388
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,284
( all gasp )

389
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,252
You're not
making any sense.

390
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,121
You're a mermaid.

391
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:13,291
Well, not exactly.

392
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,693
I'm really a human.

393
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:16,661
What?

394
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,629
( all gasp )

395
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,965
I've never seen a human
who can change into our form.

396
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:22,767
Perhaps she's some
kind of witch.

397
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:23,701
A witch?

398
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,203
Sofia is not a witch.

399
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:28,139
She's my friend.
She helped me when I was hurt.

400
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,607
Cora, you saw.

401
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,076
All I saw is that
you hurt your fin.

402
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:33,678
Cora.
I saw them.

403
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,279
Sofia was helping
oona swim.

404
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:38,916
I can get the ship to
leave, your majesty.

405
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:40,318
Just give me the chance.

406
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,286
Please, mom.
We can trust her.

407
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,222
We can't trust any humans.

408
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:48,626
Plank. Sofia come forward.

409
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:53,231
Do you give your word that you
will move your ship immediately?

410
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,232
I do.

411
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:56,300
Then go, child.
Leave this cove

412
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,702
And never return.

413
00:18:57,704 --> 00:19:00,071
I will, your majesty.

414
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:03,708
Thank you.
Goodbye, oona.

415
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,042
Bye, sofia.

416
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:06,878
With all due respect,
your majesty.

417
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,315
Everyone must be given the
chance to do the right thing.

418
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,416
Let me just
say that seahorses

419
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,719
Are very good judges of
character

420
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:18,022
Will do what she says,
your majesty.

421
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:19,357
No one asked you, sven.

422
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,692
No one ever does.
That's why I have to speak up.

423
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,361
It doesn't matter what we say,
sven.

424
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:26,030
It's not like anyone listens.

425
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,273
Sofia. Sorry about my mom.

426
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,874
She's not always like that.

427
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:39,143
Plank is, but my mom isn't.

428
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:41,245
That's alright, I understand.

429
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:43,147
It's just too bad
I have to go.

430
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:45,283
I mean, we just
became friends.

431
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:46,384
I know.

432
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:47,818
I'll miss you.

433
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,688
Me too.

434
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,031
Hello, there!
( screams )

435
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,866
Going so soon?

436
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,936
Don't be scared,
little mermaid.

437
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:07,205
I only need your comb.

438
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:08,339
( eleectric shock )

439
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:10,241
( screams )

440
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:14,011
The comb must have some kind
of protection charm on it.

441
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,214
Catch that mermaid, wormy!

442
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:17,915
( gurgles )

443
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:19,383
( coughs )

444
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,288
( sighs )

445
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:28,159
Help! Sofia!

446
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:30,061
Oona?

447
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,229
I'm coming!

448
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,308
Oh!

449
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,811
Pardon me, 'scuse me,
pardon me.

450
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:49,347
Out of my way, seafood!

451
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:55,019
Pardon me, 'scuse me...
I'm sorry, excuse me.

452
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,157
( yells)
( gurgles )

453
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:05,429
Well done, wormy.

454
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:12,203
( panting )
where did they go?

455
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:16,274
Oona? Oona?

456
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:17,308
Oona?

457
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,843
Oona?

458
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:20,811
Excellent.

459
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:23,447
Now, let's take the
mermaid back to the boat

460
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:27,351
So I can find a spell that will
break the protection charm.

461
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:30,354
Oh, unless you'd like
to save us all the trouble

462
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:33,491
And hand over
the mermaid comb now.

463
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,393
Okay.
You mean it?

464
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:38,062
Never!

465
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:39,030
( groaning )

466
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:44,101
Oh, that was unwise.

467
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:47,071
And surprisingly painful.

468
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:50,941
But... I will get your comb
one way or another.

469
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:53,110
Let's go, wormy.

470
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:55,513
( gurgles )

471
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,382
Oona?

472
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:01,552
Oh, no.

473
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:08,559
Why isn't the ship
moving yet?

474
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:10,161
They haven't even
lifted the anchor!

475
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,462
Patience, plank.

476
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:14,832
Help! Help!
A sea monster took oona!

477
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,301
It chased her
into the kelp forest.

478
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:19,337
And then they disappeared.

479
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:22,340
Oona's gone?
That's not possible.

480
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:26,243
We all know there are no sea
monsters in these waters.

481
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:27,478
But I saw it!

482
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,180
The humans must have
taken oona captive

483
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:30,614
And sent the girl back
to lie to us.

484
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:32,450
That's not true!

485
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:35,453
Queen emmaline, use your trident
to conjure a storm so fierce,

486
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:38,389
It will sink the ship so we
can take oona back ourselves!

487
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:39,357
No!

488
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:41,359
( all gasping )

489
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:46,263
Then have your people
return my daughter at once.

490
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:47,932
I-- I can't!

491
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:50,368
Then you give me no choice.

492
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,338
Wait!

493
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,140
I'll find a way to bring oona
back.

494
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:58,209
I just need a little time.

495
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,311
Please, your majesty.

496
00:23:00,313 --> 00:23:02,713
You have until sundown.

497
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,949
Okay.

498
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,456
We should sink
the ship now.

499
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,492
And endanger
all those people?

500
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:17,294
Plank, I know
what happened to you

501
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:20,097
The last time humans
were in the cove.

502
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:22,533
Follow the girl.
Just keep an eye on her.

503
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:25,069
And let me know
if you see oona.

504
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:27,071
I will, your majesty.

505
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,278
Mom, is oona going to be okay?

506
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,414
Of course, cora.

507
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:41,385
One way or another
we'll get her back.

508
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:47,224
Let me out,
you ugly sea monster.

509
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:50,428
Not until I get your comb.
And let's not get personal.

510
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:03,507
♪ bum, bum-bum, bum

511
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:05,476
Operation lunch rescue
has begun.

512
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:07,511
( humming )

513
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,381
Target has been spotted.

514
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:19,423
( yells, crashes )

515
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:20,524
You okay, mate?

516
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:22,126
( yells )

517
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:24,962
( both groaning )

518
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,233
Mission not accomplished.

519
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:31,502
Are you satisfied?

520
00:24:31,504 --> 00:24:33,637
Now both of us
have lost our lunch.

521
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,072
My lunch.

522
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:36,507
It's nobody's lunch now.

523
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:38,242
Right, I'm off.

524
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:40,344
Come on, stop it!

525
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:41,245
Ow.

526
00:24:41,247 --> 00:24:43,981
This is awkward.

527
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,049
Mm-hmm.

528
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:46,584
Your majesties,

529
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:48,452
Lunch is served
on the terrace.

530
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:52,122
Still getting our sea legs,
are we?

531
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:54,325
I've never felt better,
admiral hornpipe?

532
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:55,693
Baileywick,
will you find sofia

533
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:57,161
And let her know
it's time to eat?

534
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:58,462
Right away, your majesty.

535
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:02,132
Oh, probably back to her
room to finish her book.

536
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:05,369
Hmph. I don't know why anyone
would want to stay inside

537
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:07,638
On such a prefect day.

538
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,673
Sofia, wait!

539
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:10,708
What is it?

540
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,376
Let me look at you.

541
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:13,344
Hold still.

542
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:16,514
Hmm.

543
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:19,550
Seahorses always know when
someone is telling the truth.

544
00:25:19,552 --> 00:25:22,520
And you were
telling the truth!

545
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:25,389
Which means oona really was
captured by a sea monster

546
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:27,124
We have to find her.
I'll help you look.

547
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:28,425
But she could be anywhere.

548
00:25:28,427 --> 00:25:30,294
Then we'll search
the entire cove.

549
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:32,496
But we only have until
the end of the day.

550
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:36,367
Is there anyone in
that ship of yours
who can help us?

551
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:46,443
Sofia! There you are.

552
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:49,780
Baileywick, I need to talk
to mom and dad right away.

553
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,450
Look who I found.

554
00:25:53,452 --> 00:25:56,453
Sofia! Why is your
hair wet?

555
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:59,423
You know you're
not supposed to go
swimming by yourself.

556
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:02,159
I need your help.
Something terrible
has happened.

557
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:05,095
What?
Well, it's a long story.

558
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:07,798
But... I met a mermaid.

559
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,500
You did?
No way!

560
00:26:09,502 --> 00:26:11,468
Where is she?
I want to see her.

561
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:14,505
Amber! Sofia's
just kidding... Right?

562
00:26:14,507 --> 00:26:17,341
No, dad. I really
met a mermaid.

563
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:18,409
Impossible!

564
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:19,843
But I did.
Her name's oona,

565
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:21,745
And we need
to rescue her.

566
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:22,846
From what?

567
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:26,383
A sea monster
kidnapped her,
admiral hornpipe,

568
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:28,619
And her mother,
the mermaid queen,

569
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:31,789
Thinks <i>we</i> took her,
so if we don't save
oona by sundown,

570
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:33,457
The queen is going
to make a storm

571
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:34,692
That is going to sink
our floating palace.

572
00:26:34,694 --> 00:26:37,227
Ha! That's preposterous.

573
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:39,630
It does seem a little
farfetched, sofia.

574
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:43,233
It sounds... Like one
of the stories in
her mermaid book.

575
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:46,403
Well, perhaps sofia
fell asleep reading
her book

576
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:48,539
And dreamt about
all this balderdash.

577
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:50,474
It's not balderdash.

578
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:53,377
So then, can we meet
one of these mermaids?

579
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:56,180
Well... No.
You can't.

580
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:58,415
Not right now.
'cause oona's missing,

581
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:00,484
And the others are too scared
to come up to the surface.

582
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:02,920
Well, there you have it.
Either she dreamt it,

583
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:04,955
Or she's making it up.

584
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:07,257
Sofia doesn't make
things up.

585
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:11,562
She's always pretending
to talk to that bunny of hers.

586
00:27:11,564 --> 00:27:14,298
Clover. He'll help me.

587
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,699
I gotta go.

588
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:18,602
( audibly struggling )

589
00:27:18,604 --> 00:27:20,371
Still awkward!

590
00:27:20,373 --> 00:27:23,741
Clover, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

591
00:27:23,743 --> 00:27:25,376
Oh. What happened?

592
00:27:25,378 --> 00:27:27,544
This seagull took my lunch.

593
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:29,546
The lunch you took
from the galley.

594
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:31,615
Where else was I supposed
to get it?

595
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:34,218
Oh, it doesn't matter.
I really need your help.

596
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,452
Are you two talking?

597
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,388
What does it look like
we're doing?

598
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,355
Oona's in trouble.

599
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:39,523
Oona the mermaid?

600
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:41,392
You know her?
Yeah.

601
00:27:41,394 --> 00:27:42,559
A sea monster
kidnaped her.

602
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:43,794
A sea monster?!

603
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:45,396
Can you help me
look for her, clover?

604
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:46,430
Sure, kid.

605
00:27:46,432 --> 00:27:48,332
I'll hop up to the top
of the palace.

606
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,801
Oh, I bet you could see
the whole cove from up there.

607
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:52,870
Righto. And I'll
search from the air.

608
00:27:52,872 --> 00:27:55,172
You will?
Thanks, mr. Seagull.

609
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,641
Well, thanks
mr. Farley seagull.

610
00:27:57,643 --> 00:27:59,610
I'm going back in the water.

611
00:27:59,612 --> 00:28:01,512
Oh, I hope we can find her.

612
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:02,913
We will.

613
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:05,516
( audibly struggling )

614
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:07,518
Whew. One step down...

615
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,820
Way too many to go.

616
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,391
Huh? Where are they going?

617
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:16,360
And where's oona?

618
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:18,629
( merpeople muttering )

619
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,398
Plank. Any news?

620
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,700
The girl went up to a ship,

621
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:25,436
Then came back in the water
and swam off.

622
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:27,404
Was oona with her?
No.

623
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:30,441
And need I remind you
that not only is oona
in jeopardy,

624
00:28:30,443 --> 00:28:31,909
But so is the mermaid comb.

625
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:33,744
If the humans take it,
they'll have the power

626
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:35,446
Of the ocean
at their fingertips!

627
00:28:35,448 --> 00:28:36,747
Use your trident.

628
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:38,549
Conjure a storm
that will sink
their ship.

629
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:40,384
Then we can swim
inside it

630
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:41,819
And take oona
back ourselves.

631
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:45,289
If we sink their ship,
the humans could all perish.

632
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:47,758
But mom,
we can't just
let them keep oona.

633
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,593
I'll give them one more hour.

634
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:51,595
If your sister
isn't released by then,

635
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:54,631
We will bring their ship
to the bottom of the cove.

636
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:57,367
You can keep me in here
as long as you want.

637
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:59,503
I'm never giving up my comb.

638
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:02,473
I promised my mother
I wouldn't let anyone
else have it.

639
00:29:02,475 --> 00:29:04,808
Oh, then it'll be
a terrible shame

640
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:07,277
When that promise
is broken,

641
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,547
Because
the mermaid comb
of merroway cove

642
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,583
Will be mine!

643
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:18,822
This spell is going
to undo the magic charm

644
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:20,390
Protecting your comb

645
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:22,993
And deliver it
right into the palm
of my hand!

646
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:24,895
Oh, I mean flipper--

647
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:26,563
Er, whatever this is.

648
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:28,265
( clears throat )

649
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:32,436
Forces of magic,
with power beyond
measure,

650
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,571
Break the enchantment

651
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:38,408
And bring me the treasure!

652
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:42,279
But what-- what is that?

653
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:50,487
( exclaims )

654
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:51,688
Didn't work.

655
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,824
( comical shrieking )

656
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:57,694
Oh, wormy, I'll get you
back in the water.

657
00:29:57,696 --> 00:30:00,564
I'll have to find
another spell.

658
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,067
( gasps )
oona!

659
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:13,544
Okay. Sofia's gonna
owe me big time for this.

660
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:22,352
( sighs ) pretty good
view from up here.

661
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:24,388
( gasps )

662
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,557
No rats on my ship!

663
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:31,428
Hold up!
Stop! Whoa, I say!

664
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,530
Off with it!

665
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:38,001
You are just as
heavy as you look,
you know that?

666
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:40,404
Are you kidding me?
I must have shed
five ounces

667
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:41,839
Climbing up
all those stairs.

668
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:43,674
I found oona.
You did?!

669
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,409
Yeah, but now
I can't find sofia.

670
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:47,778
Hey, there she is.
Down there!

671
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,779
We should keep looking.

672
00:30:48,781 --> 00:30:50,547
I'm going to check in
with clover.

673
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:51,949
Maybe he saw something.

674
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:54,484
Right. And who is
clover, exactly?

675
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:55,853
Clover: Sofia!
Huh?

676
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:57,120
Aah!

677
00:30:57,122 --> 00:30:58,922
Thanks for
the soft landing.

678
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:02,159
Sofia, the sea monster
has oona on a boat.

679
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:04,962
Where?
You.
!

680
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,400
Wait. You're going alone?

681
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:12,669
No. Farley and spin
are going with me.

682
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:16,006
No one else believes me,
so I have to try myself.

683
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,410
Be careful, sofia.

684
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,814
Yes!
Now, this spell

685
00:31:23,816 --> 00:31:26,817
Will surely get that comb.

686
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:28,518
( clears throat )

687
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:33,056
<i>Suspendus denati</i>
<i>venite!</i>

688
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,659
<i>Aaaahhh!</i>

689
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:41,965
Merlin's mushrooms!

690
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:44,768
I'll have to consult
my other spell books.

691
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,537
Hmm. Which book?

692
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:48,672
Ah!

693
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:50,540
<i>The joy of sorcery.</i>

694
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:52,042
Yes. Perfect.

695
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:58,482
Farley!

696
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,418
( gasps )
sofia!

697
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,552
Where's that monster?

698
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:03,854
Up there.

699
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:12,129
He's trying to steal
my enchanted comb.

700
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:14,097
Don't worry.
I'll get you out.

701
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,102
Where's the key?
I don't know.

702
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:31,214
( sofia gasps )

703
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:33,583
There it is!

704
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:38,055
( muttering )

705
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,558
( exclaims and mutters )

706
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:44,861
( gasps )

707
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:46,530
( gasps )

708
00:32:46,532 --> 00:32:48,031
Aah!

709
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:49,866
Aah!

710
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:57,507
Aah!
Go, sofia!

711
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:00,143
Hurry!

712
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:04,114

00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,051

Oh, where'd it go?

715
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:18,228
What happened?
Did you see a key?

716
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,597
A key, a key, a key.

717
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:23,600
What's a key?
We've <i>got</i> to find it.

718
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,772
Oh, well, I was aiming
for the princess,

719
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:31,274
Not the key,
but not to worry--

720
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:33,043
I still have you.

723
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,955
I can't wait any longer.

724
00:33:44,957 --> 00:33:47,791
It's time we take matters
into our own hands.

725
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:51,194
Everyone, go back to your
homes until we return.

726
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,932
Plank, let's go
get my daughter back.

727
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:57,200
Yes, your majesty.

728
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,935
I'm coming too.
No.

729
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:01,104
It's going to be
too dangerous up there.

730
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:02,606
But she's my little sister,

731
00:34:02,608 --> 00:34:04,608
And I'm supposed
to look out for her.

732
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,110
We will find oona,
I promise.

733
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,184
( sighs )

734
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,965
Looks like
a storm's coming!

735
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:30,267
It's not coming.

736
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:45,982
Queen emmaline
is bringing it.

737
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:47,684
Whoa.

738
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:49,319
Ohh! Daddy?

739
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:51,354
It's just a little
squall, amber.

740
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:52,823
( amber gasps )

741
00:34:52,825 --> 00:34:55,292
Baileywick, can you
make sure sofia's all right?

742
00:34:55,294 --> 00:34:57,327
I'll go check on her.

743
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:02,766
The queen is going to sink
my family's ship.

744
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:04,267
Let's tell her we found oona.

745
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,669
She won't believe me.

746
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:07,170
No one believes me.

747
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:09,139
I don't know
what else to do.

748
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,843
Uh, your necklace
is glowing.

749
00:35:12,845 --> 00:35:14,611
What's that?

750
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,114
Let's find out.

751
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:30,393
Ariel?

752
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:32,863
Princess ariel?!
What are you doing here?

753
00:35:32,865 --> 00:35:35,298
Sofia's amulet
brought me here to help.

754
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,367
Now, what's going on,
sofia?

755
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:39,169
My friend oona
is in trouble.

756
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:40,704
I tried to save her,
but...

757
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:43,206
You couldn't do it
on your own?
No.

758
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:45,342
We all need a little
help sometimes.

759
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:49,312
Once, prince eric
needed my help
when his ship sank.

760
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,414
My family's ship
is in danger, too.

761
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:52,849
Mm-hmm. Well, luckily,

762
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:55,252

I know what to do now.

Sofia, what mermaid
is gonna trust a human?

804
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:32,309
A mermaid whose little
sister is in trouble.

805
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:36,079
You!

806
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:37,480
Just cool your fins, cora.

807
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,182
Where's my sister?

808
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:40,483
Sofia is telling
the truth.

809
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:43,153
I saw the sea monster
with my own eyes.

810
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:45,155
Both of them.
You did?

811
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:47,924
He's after oona's comb,
and he knows magic.

812
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:50,460
You're oona's big sister,
and the only way to save her

813
00:38:50,462 --> 00:38:52,462
Is for us to work together.

814
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:56,299
You said the monster
wants oona's comb?

815
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:57,467
That's what she told me.

816
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:59,369
Then we have to free her
before he gets it.

817
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:02,305
It has the power
to control the ocean.

818
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:03,373
It does?

819
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:04,974
Mom gave the comb to oona

820
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:06,409
So no one
would abuse its powers.

821
00:39:06,411 --> 00:39:08,478
But she doesn't even
know what it can do.

822
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,481
She should have
given it to me.
I know how to use it.

823
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:13,450
And then oona wouldn't
be in danger.

824
00:39:13,452 --> 00:39:14,884
So will you help me?

825
00:39:14,886 --> 00:39:17,120
Anything for oona.

826
00:39:17,122 --> 00:39:19,422

827
00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:21,458
Ohh! But what
about the storm?

828
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,426
We have to stop it
before it gets too big

829
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:24,861
And sinks our palace.

830
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:27,330
Don't worry.
I can stop queen emmaline.

831
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:29,299

this one, cora.

834
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:36,406
Actually, this is just
the immediate family.

835
00:39:36,408 --> 00:39:38,108
We'll pick up the cousins
on the way.

Let's hit the waves, gang!

837

Come on!

838
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:44,914
Where are you, sofia?

839
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:47,384
Ohh!

840
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:49,886
Aha!
What are you doing back here?

841
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,221
Oona's still in danger,

842
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:53,390
So I thought you and I
could team up.

843
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:54,457
We'll be unstoppable.

844
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:56,426

You did?
Impossible!

She's not in her room,

But I have all the servants

Not so fast,

Give me the comb,
and I'll let your

Don't give it to him,

Don't worry. I have a plan.

892
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:16,266
But my mermaid friend
can! Cora!

893
00:42:16,268 --> 00:42:18,401
( gasps ) cora!
Cora!

894
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:22,805
Waters rise at my command!

895
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,511
( gasps )
aaahhhh!

896
00:42:28,513 --> 00:42:31,281
Aaaaaaahhhhhhhh!

897
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:35,151
Thanks for
rescuing me, sofia.

898
00:42:35,153 --> 00:42:36,452
It wasn't just me.

899
00:42:36,454 --> 00:42:37,420
Oona!

900
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:39,188
Cora!

901
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:41,658
You saved me!

902
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,426
I guess having a big sister

903
00:42:43,428 --> 00:42:47,297
Looking out for me
isn't such a bad
thing after all.

904
00:42:47,299 --> 00:42:49,632
Here.
This belongs to you.

905
00:42:49,634 --> 00:42:50,833
Thanks.

906
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:53,169
Maybe you can show me
how to use it some time.

907
00:42:53,171 --> 00:42:55,171
Sure... If mom <i>lets</i> me.

908
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:56,406
Right.

909
00:42:56,408 --> 00:42:58,441
Come on! We have
to find your mom!

910
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:04,180
Swim, seahorses, swim!

911
00:43:04,182 --> 00:43:05,381
Sven!

912
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:11,154
Mom!

913
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:13,456
Oona!
You're all right!

914
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:17,427
You're all right!
Thanks to sofia.

915
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:21,164
What?
You were wrong
about her, plank.

916
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:23,166
We all were.

917
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:26,636
I'm sorry.
I don't know what to say.

918
00:43:26,638 --> 00:43:30,573
( storm rumbles )

919
00:43:30,575 --> 00:43:33,576
Ohh! I have to
stop that storm.

920
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,359
Your majesties.

921
00:43:49,361 --> 00:43:50,460
Did you find sofia?

922
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:52,428
Not yet. But--

923
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,497
Your majesties, wait!

924
00:43:54,499 --> 00:43:56,232
Wait for us!

925
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:02,171
Miranda! Is that
what I think it is?

926
00:44:02,173 --> 00:44:04,574
( gasps )
it's a mermaid.

927
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,717
A mermaid!

928
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,286
Is she making
the storm go away?
I don't know.

929
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:20,323
Barnacles,
it's a mermaid!

930
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:28,531
Look!

931
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:32,502
The storm's breaking up!

932
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,939
Your family's
going to be okay.

933
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:54,557
Aaahhh!

934
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:58,227
You know, you
don't have to drop me
every time we land.

935
00:44:58,229 --> 00:45:00,463
I know. But I enjoy it.

936
00:45:00,465 --> 00:45:03,032
( giggling ) oona,
can you wait here?

937
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:05,568
Sure.
I'll be right back.

938
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,838
Mom! Dad!

939
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,673
Thank goodness
you're all right!

940
00:45:10,675 --> 00:45:13,209
I'm sorry
we doubted you,
sofia.

941
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,745
It's okay, dad.
So, do you want to meet
the mermaids?

942
00:45:15,747 --> 00:45:17,980
Right now?
Yeah!
You bet I do!

943
00:45:17,982 --> 00:45:19,449
Uh, I mean, why not?

944
00:45:19,451 --> 00:45:21,851
I think it's about time
we all became friends.

945
00:45:21,853 --> 00:45:25,655
Oh! Sofia! I knew you were
telling the truth all along!

946
00:45:25,657 --> 00:45:28,357
What are we waiting for?
Let's go see them!

947
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,302
Oh! Hi!

948
00:45:39,304 --> 00:45:42,405
Whoa! She's got a tail
and everything!

949
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:44,407
She's a mermaid, james.
Try to keep up.

950
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:46,976
This is my friend oona.

951
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:49,345
Oona, this is my family.

952
00:45:49,347 --> 00:45:51,314
Hi.
Hi!
Hey!

953
00:45:51,316 --> 00:45:53,683
Pleased to meet you, oona.
Well, hello there!

954
00:45:53,685 --> 00:45:55,485
Do you want to meet <i>my</i> family?

955
00:45:55,487 --> 00:45:57,019
We'd love to!

956
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:10,633
That's oona's sister, cora.
Oh! Hmm!

957
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,383
Whoa!

958
00:46:27,385 --> 00:46:29,819
Oh, my.

959
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:38,361
This is my mom,
queen emmaline.

960
00:46:38,363 --> 00:46:42,064
Your majesty. It is an honor
to make your acquaintance.

961
00:46:42,066 --> 00:46:44,066
The honor is mine.

962
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:52,942
Oooh!

963
00:46:52,944 --> 00:46:56,946
Water to air,
sea to land...

964
00:46:56,948 --> 00:47:00,783
Turn us back
to bird and man.

965
00:47:00,785 --> 00:47:01,851
Whoa!

966
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:06,489
Well, at least
<i>that</i> spell worked.

967
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:08,090
Come along, wormy.

968
00:47:08,092 --> 00:47:10,459
I need a vacation.

969
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:13,563
Ohh.

970
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:27,476
I love your headband, cora.
What's it made of?

971
00:47:27,478 --> 00:47:29,645
Whoo-hoo!
Oh!
Oh!

972
00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:31,480
James!

973
00:47:31,482 --> 00:47:33,449
( all laugh )

974

( sofia giggles )

975
00:47:35,486 --> 00:47:38,421
I'm glad everyone's
getting along.

976
00:47:38,423 --> 00:47:41,023
Me too! It means
we can be friends now.

977
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:43,526
It means we can <i>all</i>
<i>be friends now.</i>
