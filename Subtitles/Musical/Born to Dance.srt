It's Latin for ''he opened the door

01:13:26,948 --> 01:13:29,007
Ted hasn't been near the theater.

Oh, weII,
did you expect to see him around?

WeII, yes, I did,
but I guess I was wrong about him.

1051

You know, I can't figure him out.

1052
01:13:41,296 --> 01:13:43,924
He hasn't seen Lucy James
since we started rehearsing.

JENNY: He hasn't?
-Not once.

1054

Then, why haven't you heard
from him?

1055
01:13:47,836 --> 01:13:49,701
Maybe because he thinks I'm married.

1056

Oh, I'm sorry about that.

Lucy James conscious.

But pIease, Mac,
not about my private Iife.

If he's crazy about you,
why hasn't he been around?

-Because he resents the whoIe thing.
-Oh, he does. WeII, that's too bad.
