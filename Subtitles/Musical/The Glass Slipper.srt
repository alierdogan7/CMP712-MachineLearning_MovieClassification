00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,150
NARRATOR: A LONG TIME AGO
IN A SMALL PRINCIPALITY

2
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,130
SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A HAPPY EUROPE,

3
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,350
THERE WAS A RICH OLD DUKE
WHO LIVED HAPPILY IN A FINE PALACE,

4
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,510
AND A NUMBER OF LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
WHO LIVED HAPPILY

5
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,640
ON THE FASHIONABLE HILL
AND EVERYBODY ELSE WHO LIVED

6
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,130
HAPPILY IN THE VILLAGE.

7
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,230
NOW IT CAME TO PASS
 THAT IN THE SPRING,

8
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,630
THREE DAYS OF FESTIVAL WERE DECLARED.

9
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,980
THEY WERE CELEBRATING
THE RETURN OF PRINCE CHARLES,

10
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,320
THE ONLY SON OF THE REIGNING DUKE.

11
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,410
MOST OF THE TOWNSPEOPLE
HAD NEVER SEEN PRINCE CHARLES.

12
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,070
HE HAD BEEN AWAY FOR MANY YEARS,
GETTING HIS EDUCATION

13
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:16,030
IN THE FINEST UNIVERSITIES,
CAFES, AND BOUDOIRS OF PARIS,

14
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,530
LONDON, AND VIENNA.

15
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,800
WOMAN: NO, NOT THAT WAY!

16
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,280
[LAUGHTER]

17
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,180
WOMAN: OH, LOOK!
NOW IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

18
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,380
SECOND WOMAN: YES, LIKE THAT.
BUT A LITTLE HIGHER, WILLIE.

19
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,080
HIGHER?
 I'LL BREAK MY NECK!

20
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,830
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE WAITING FOR!

21
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,950
[LAUGHTER]

22
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,350
WILLIE: WELL,
WHERE'S THE HAMMER?

23
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,670
SECOND WOMAN:  OH, IT'S, UH...
OH, OVER THERE!

24
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,260
EDWINA, HOLD THIS, PLEASE.

25
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,820
TIE IT TO THE OTHER ONE.

26
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:10,770
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

27
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,390
WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

28
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,660
I WANT TO--TO HELP.
I CLEAN UP, EH?

29
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,210
I'LL PICK UP THE ONES THAT DROP,

30
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,920
SO THAT EVERYTHING
BE NICE AND CLEAN.

31
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,530
SHE'S GOING TO MAKE
EVERYTHING NICE AND CLEAN.

32
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,070
I'LL SWEEP THE TORN LEAVES
AND THE LITTLE STRINGS.

33
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:25,820
SEE?

34
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,680
STAY AWAY FROM ME,
YOU DIRTY THING!

35
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,740
OH, I'M NOT DIRTY!

36
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,770
JUST CINDERS. LOOK!

37
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,740
PLEASE, LOOK!

38
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,260
OH, MAKE HER GO AWAY, WILLIE.

39
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,830
MY MOTHER SAYS
I MUSTN'T SPEAK TO HER.

40
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,320
GO AWAY, CINDERS.

41
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,370
MY NAME IS ELLA, AND I'M NOT DIRTY.

42
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,380
I'VE JUST BEEN CARRYING OUT THE ASHES.

43
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,040
JUST CINDERS AND ASHES.

44
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,760
MAYBE A LITTLE SOOT,
BUT I--

45
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,010
ELLA CINDER!

46
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,080
DIRTY CINDER!

47
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,090
ELLA CINDER!

48
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,480
WILLIE:  GOOD-BYE, CINDERELLA.

49
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,760
CINDERELLA!

50
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:01,650
CINDERELLA!

51
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,510
STOP IT!

52
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,110
NOW LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE,
YOU UGLY THING!

53
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,470
I AM NOT UGLY!

54
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,050
YOU ARE UGLY!
YOU SMELL OF BUTTER!

55
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,280
YOU HAVE A BIG FAT BOPU.

56
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,540
AND YOU HAVE A VOICE LIKE A PIG!

57
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,150
AND YOU--YOU--

58
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,360
YOU--

59
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,820
NARRATOR:
SO, YOU SEE HOW IT WAS.

60
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,860
OH, WELL, THEY CAN
SCARCELY BE BLAMED,

61
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,710
FOR SHE WAS NOT PRECISELY
AN AMIABLE CHILD.

62
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,190
THE GROWN-UPS OF THE TOWN
AGREED WITH THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS.

63
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,710
THEY'RE SAYING, "TSK, TSK.
DREADFUL, DREADFUL.

64
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,920
"THE GIRL'S A DISGRACE.

65
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,380
"SHE GROWS WORSE EVERY DAY.
LOOK AT HER HAIR."

66
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,760
IT WAS THE OLD STORY
OF THE REJECTED BECOMING

67
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,400
ALL THE MORE REJECTED
BECAUSE THEY BEHAVED BADLY

68
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,680
BECAUSE THEY'D BEEN REJECTED--
ONE OF THOSE, UH, CIRCLES.

69
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,640
AND THERE IT WAS AGAIN,
THE HEAT OF TEARS BURNING

70
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:51,640
BEHIND THE EYES.
AND SO SHE CAME HOME.

71
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,340
THIS PRIMPING IS IN PREPARATION
FOR THE ARRIVAL OF THE PRINCE,

72
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,610
FOR HE MAY GLANCE THEIR WAY
WHEN HE RIDES DOWN THE STREET.

73
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,760
THESE ARE ELLA'S STEPSISTERS.
THIS IS BIRDENA--

74
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,930
VIVACIOUS, DAZZLING,
 BEAUTIFUL AS A ROSE,

75
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,980
AND POISONOUS AS A TOADSTOOL.

76
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:22,090
AND THIS IS SERAFINA--LANGUID, SEDUCTIVE,
EFFORTLESSLY ALLURING,

77
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,970
AND COLD AS A COBRA.

78
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,850
AND THIS IS ELLA'S STEPMOTHER,
THE WIDOW SONDER.

79
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,720
"STRAIGHTEN UP, ELLA.

80
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,280
"DO THIS, ELLA.

81
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:31,760
"DO THAT, ELLA.

82
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,710
"PICK UP THE THINGS
YOUR SISTERS DROPPED, ELLA.

83
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,620
"THESE ARE THE PREROGATIVES
OF BEAUTY, ELLA.

84
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,550
"COME, BIRDENA.

85
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,410
"COME, SERAFINA.

86
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:41,050
"I AM THE MOTHER OF THE PRETTIEST GIRLS
IN THE VILLAGE.

87
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,510
"NOT YOU, ELLA!

88
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,730
"STAY BACK HERE, ELLA.

89
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,890
"DON'T STAND WITH US.

90
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,910
"THE PRINCE MAY
THINK WE KNOW YOU."

91
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:53,890
[FANFARE]

92
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,310
CROWD:  
LONG LIVE THE PRINCE!

93
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,160
MAN:  
LONG LIVE PRINCE CHARLES!

94
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,610
DID YOU SEE HIM 
LOOK RIGHT THIS WAY?

95
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,210
HE DID, INDEED, LOOK THIS WAY.

96
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,530
HE LOOKED RIGHT AT ME.

97
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,330
AT YOU?

98
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,920
HE DISTINCTLY LOOKED
RIGHT AT ME.

99
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,790
NO, HE DIDN'T!

100
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,580
I SAW HIM.

101
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:09,180
OH, YOU DID NOT SEE HIM.
YOU WERE WAY BACK HERE.

102
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,560
I DID, TOO.
I SAW HIM.

103
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,810
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

104
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,740
I DID!

105
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,140
VERY WELL. WHAT DID
HE LOOK LIKE?

106
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,850
HE...
WELL, HE LOOKED--

107
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,550
HE LOOKED LIKE
A HANDSOME PRINCE

108
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,930
ON A BEAUTIFUL
WHITE HORSE.

109
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,350
YOU SEE?

110
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,560
THE HORSE WAS BLACK,

111
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,530
BLACK AS NIGHT.

112
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,400
SHE DIDN'T SEE HIM AT ALL.

113
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,330
I DID!

114
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,370
WHAT COLOR WAS HIS HAIR?

115
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,250
IT WAS BLACK,
BLACK AS NIGHT.

116
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,770
WELL, YOU SEE?

117
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,260
WHAT A FIB.

118
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:38,770
WHO--WHO CARES ABOUT
AN OLD PRINCE, ANYWAY?

119
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,920
I HATE HIM! I DON'T CARE.
I HATE HIM!

120
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,990
WHAT AN UNPLEASANT
GIRL YOU ARE.

121
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,280
I DON'T CARE!

122
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,610
NARRATOR:
THE LITTLE SPIRIT IS STILL DEFIANT

123
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,200
AND DEFENSIVE,
 STILL UNBROKEN.

124
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,280
BUT GIVE THEM TIME.
THEY'LL BREAK IT.

125
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,380
A FEW MORE YEARS,
AND SHE WILL STOP FIGHTING BACK

126
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,540
AND WILL NO LONGER
FEEL ANY PAIN.

127
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,730
THE OTHERS WILL THEN
HAVE THE CONVENIENCE

128
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,190
OF AN UNPAID SPINSTER SLAVEY
IN THE HOUSE--

129
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,660
WILLING, DOCILE,
GRATEFUL FOR CRUMBS.

130
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,500
A FEW MORE YEARS,
AND ALL WILL BE PEACEFUL.

131
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,850
HERE WAS HER OWN PLACE,
A PLACE ALL BY ITSELF.

132
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,890
THE SWEET BROOK GLITTERED,
THE FOREST WAS COOL,

133
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:32,360
AND A MEADOWLARK WAS
CONFIDING ITS HEARTBREAK

134
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,960
TO THE QUIET AIR.

135
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,030
[ELLA CRYING]

136
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,260
WHY ARE YOU CRYING?

137
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
YOU SWEET, PRETTY CREATURE?

138
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,680
YOU'RE MAKING FUN OF ME.

139
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,490
I'M NOT SWEET AND PRETTY.

140
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,560
BUT IT'S ONLY ASHES.

141
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,340
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ASHES?
VERY GOOD FOR THE CHICKENS.

142
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,880
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

143
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,360
ELLA.

144
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,430
BUT THEY WON'T EVEN
CALL ME BY MY NAME.

145
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,640
THEY CALL ME--

146
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,100
EDWARD AND WILLIE
AND ALL THE OTHERS--

147
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:19,260
BECAUSE OF THE ASHES,
THEY CALL ME CINDERELLA.

148
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,700
CINDERELLA?

149
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,650
CINDER ELLA,
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL WORD.

150
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,690
I LIKE IT VERY MUCH.

151
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,860
THERE ARE OTHER WORDS
I LIKE VERY MUCH,

152
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:29,430
LIKE WINDOWSILL...
AND ELBOW.

153
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,650
ELBOW.

154
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,890
AND I LIKE
APPLE DUMPLING, TOO.

155
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,350
IT'S A COMICAL WORD.

156
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,000
APPLE DUMPLING.

157
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,730
PICKLE RELISH.

158
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,570
THAT HAS A NICE SNAP TO IT.

159
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:41,790
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOUR HAIR?

160
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,130
I CUT IT OFF.

161
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,220
I--I GOT ANGRY AT IT.

162
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,340
ONE DAY, I HATED MYSELF SO,
I WANTED TO BE DEAD.

163
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,240
BUT I CUT MY HAIR OFF INSTEAD.

164
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,440
AND I FELT MUCH BETTER AFTER.

165
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,300
IT'S GROWING NOW.

166
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,500
SPLENDID.

167
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,820
NO USE COMBING IT
OR ANYTHING.

168
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,660
IT DOES PRESENT
A PROBLEM.

169
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,360
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

170
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,890
MRS. TOQUET.

171
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,650
OH, YOU'RE THE CRAZY LA--

172
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:23,620
I MEAN...YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO LIVES ALL BY YOURSELF?

173
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:27,980
THEY SAY YOU NEVER COME 
INTO THE VILLAGE DURING DAYTIME.

174
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,100
THAT'S RIGHT.

175
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,730
WHY?

176
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,220
BECAUSE I ALWAYS
GO THERE AT NIGHT.

177
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,770
YOU--YOUR SHOES
ARE GETTING WET.

178
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,430
YES. IT'S THE WATER.

179
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,020
OH.

180
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:41,980
DO YOU LIVE
IN THE VILLAGE?

181
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,980
YES.

182
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,160
WITH BIRDENA, SERAFINA,
AND MY STEPMOTHER.

183
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,730
OH. HOW ARE THEY?

184
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,230
OH, YOU KNOW THEM?

185
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,100
NO. IF I KNEW THEM,
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO ASK.

186
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:53,620
OH.

187
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,590
WELL, THEY'RE
VERY WELL, THANK YOU.

188
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,230
THEY'RE VERY BUSY NOW.

189
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,300
THEY'RE GETTING READY
TO GO TO THE BALL--

190
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,750
DAY AFTER TOMORROW
AT THE PALACE.

191
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,270
THEY ARE GOING
TO MEET THE PRINCE.

192
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,390
YOU SEE, BIRDENA
AND SERAFINA

193
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,710
ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRLS
IN THE WHOLE VILLAGE.

194
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,410
THEY CAN SEW VERY WELL,

195
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,850
AND THEY HAVE FINE MANNERS
AND BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES.

196
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,260
THEY ARE JUST EVERYTHING
THAT GIRLS SHOULD BE.

197
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,430
AND YOU? WHERE ARE
YOUR PRETTY CLOTHES?

198
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,770
OH, I DON'T CARE
WHAT I LOOK LIKE.

199
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,940
THAT'S NO REASON
FOR FRIGHTENING PEOPLE.

200
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,860
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
NOBODY LIKES ME ANYWAY.

201
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,890
I LIKE YOU.

202
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,630
YOU DON'T.

203
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,230
I DON'T NEED ANYBODY
TO LIKE ME.

204
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,730
I DON'T CARE.
I DON'T CARE ONE BIT,

205
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,820
BECAUSE, ONE DAY, I'M GOING
TO LIVE IN THE PALACE.

206
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,790
OH?

207
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,310
IN THE DUCAL PALACE?

208
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,010
THAT'S RIGHT.

209
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,480
A VERY PLEASANT PLAN.
WHO ARRANGED IT?

210
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,820
WELL...

211
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,100
ONE DAY, THERE'S AN OLD LADY
WHO CAME TO SEE MY MOTHER.

212
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,940
SHE WAS A TELLER
OF FORTUNES, THEY SAY.

213
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,160
AND SHE TOLD MY MOTHER
THAT SOME DAY

214
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,310
HER CHILD WOULD LIVE
IN THE PALACE.

215
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,420
AND I WAS BORN
THREE HOURS LATER.

216
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:03,210
MY MOTHER USED TO TELL ME
THIS STORY VERY OFTEN

217
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,700
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL.

218
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,460
SHE DIED WHEN I WAS
FIVE YEARS OLD.

219
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,560
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT
TO DO IN THE PALACE?

220
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,560
OH. WELL, LOTS OF THINGS.

221
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,570
YOU KNOW.

222
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,010
SOUNDS VERY PRACTICAL.

223
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,130
AND I'LL PUNISH
EVERYBODY I HATE.

224
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,050
NO, YOU WON'T.

225
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,150
OH, YES, I WILL.

226
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,840
I WILL.

227
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,010
HERE.

228
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,760
WHERE'D YOU GET THIS?

229
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,000
OH, HERE AND THERE.

230
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,200
OH, YES, I HEARD
ABOUT THAT.

231
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,770
HERE, YOU'D BETTER
TAKE IT BACK.

232
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,400
OH, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

233
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,760
NEVERTHELESS.

234
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,260
NEVERTHELESS WHAT?

235
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,000
NEVERTHELESS
IS A NICE WORD.

236
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,400
ISN'T IT PLEASANT TO SIT AND 
EXCHANGE WORDS WITH A FRIEND?

237
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:58,920
I NEVER DID IT BEFORE, I MEAN, 
JUST SAT WITH A FRIEND AND TALKED.

238
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,900
WELL, WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOUR FRIENDS?

239
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,420
DON'T THEY HAVE
A SITTING PLACE?

240
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,280
WELL, IT'S BECAUSE I...

241
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,410
I DON'T THINK
I HAVE ANY FRIENDS.

242
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,130
I MEAN, I DON'T
THINK I DO.

243
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,010
BECAUSE WHEN
THEY'RE YOUR FRIENDS,

244
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,410
DOES THAT MEAN THAT
YOU CAN TELL THEM

245
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,680
EVERYTHING YOU LIKE
AND WHAT YOU DO

246
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,880
AND WHAT YOU FEEL
AND ALL THAT?

247
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,040
AND THAT THEY'LL ALWAYS
BE ON YOUR SIDE?

248
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,000
DOESN'T IT?

249
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,920
THAT'S RIGHT.

250
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,760
WELL, I DON'T HAVE
ANYBODY LIKE THAT.

251
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,670
YOU HAVE ME.
I'M ON YOUR SIDE.

252
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,350
AND I'M VERY DEEPLY INTERESTED
IN WHAT YOU FEEL AND THINK.

253
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,020
TELL ME.
TELL ME NOW.

254
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:41,900
WELL...I CAN'T.
IT--IT'S...IT'S ALL MIXED UP.

255
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,350
IT'S JUST A FEELING.

256
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,670
IT'S LIKE WHEN IT'S
BEGINNING TO GET DARK.

257
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,430
YOU KNOW?

258
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,660
AND--AND EVERYTHING
BREATHES VERY SOFTLY

259
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:57,250
AND THE SKY GETS
VERY, VERY BLUE

260
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,540
AND THEN VERY, VERY PINK.

261
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,940
AND HERE YOU FEEL,
OH, SOMETHING...

262
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:11,640
HMM. IT--IT'S...
IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN.

263
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,890
IT'S QUITE CLEAR.

264
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:14,940
IS IT?

265
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,320
I MUST GO NOW.

266
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,910
I HAVE SOME THINGS
TO PICK UP.

267
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,380
WELL, YOU DROP IN
AGAIN SOMETIME.

268
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,390
OH, WHEN?

269
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,310
TOMORROW PERHAPS AT NOON.

270
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,290
RIGHT HERE, THEN, HUH?

271
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,610
WE'LL TALK AND TELL
EACH OTHER THINGS...

272
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,920
AND BE FRIENDS, HUH?

273
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:31,830
EXCELLENT.

274
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,780
VERY PRACTICAL.

275
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:33,650
GOOD-BYE.

276
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,600
WINDOWSILL.

277
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,790
PICKLE RELISH.

278
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,350
APPLE DUMPLING.

279
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,980
CINDERELLA.

280
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,170
GOOD-BYE, CINDERELLA.

281
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,540
THESE HOOPS ARE TOO WIDE.

282
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,320
I'M GOING TO WEAR
THE NARROW ONES.

283
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,190
THE WIDER HOOPS ARE PRETTIER.

284
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,280
BUT THEY'RE NOT THE FASHION.

285
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,440
COUSIN LOULOU'S WEARING
ENORMOUS ONES.

286
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,270
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

287
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,950
I HEARD ALL ABOUT
COUSIN LOULOU'S GOWN

288
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,510
THIS AFTERNOON WHEN
I WENT UP TO THE HILL

289
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,460
FOR THE INVITATIONS.

290
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,550
OH! THE INVITATIONS.

291
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,390
WHERE DID YOU PUT THEM?

292
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:23,820
I GAVE THEM TO YOU.

293
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,800
OH. OH, DEAR.

294
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,210
OH, MAMA.

295
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,740
I PUT THEM DOWN.

296
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,030
AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE
WE HAD GETTING THEM.

297
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,870
OH, I HATE ASKING
COUSIN LOULOU FAVORS.

298
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,430
OH, GO AWAY, ELLA.

299
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,330
DON'T TOUCH THINGS, ELLA.

300
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,190
YOU'RE IN THE WAY, ELLA.

301
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,160
ELLA, GET OFF OF THAT.

302
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,370
YOU'RE GETTING IT
ALL DIRTY.

303
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,870
OH! HERE THEY ARE.

304
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,390
YOU MUST REMEMBER
TO THANK COUSIN LOULOU.

305
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,050
MOTHER, TOMORROW NIGHT
AT THE BALL,

306
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,490
PLEASE DON'T SPEAK
OF WHERE WE LIVE.

307
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,910
I'M GOING TO SAY THAT WE LIVE
ON THE HILL WITH COUSIN LOULOU.

308
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,850
AND WHAT WILL COUSIN
LOULOU SAY TO THAT?

309
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,340
COUSIN LOULOU WON'T HEAR IT.

310
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,600
BESIDES, NO ONE EVER
PAYS ANY ATTENTION

311
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,950
TO THAT OLD CREATURE ANYWAY.

312
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,070
[SCOLDING]
BIRDENA.

313
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,540
DON'T YOU DARE SPEAK
OF COUSIN LOULOU THAT WAY.

314
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,380
SHE'S VERY RICH.

315
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,000
WHAT'S HER DRESS LIKE?

316
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:14,350
OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
IT'S ALL PINK AND WHITE

317
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:18,260
WITH ROSEBUDS AND RIBBONS
ALL OVER THE SKIRT.

318
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:22,140
AND THOUSANDS OF CRYSTALS,
EACH ONE SEWN WITH SILK THREAD.

319
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,670
ROSEBUDS. HA HA!

320
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,220
AT HER AGE.

321
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,740
[BOTH LAUGHING]

322
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,850
STEPMOTHER: YOU MAY TAKE IT
OFF NOW, BIRDENA.

323
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,520
NOW YOU, SERAFINA.

324
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,650
WHO IS MRS. TOQUET?

325
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,410
WHO?

326
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,850
MRS. TOQUET.

327
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,680
ISN'T SHE THE CRAZY OLD WOMAN
WHO LIVES IN THE WOODS?

328
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,600
SHE'S HARMLESS,
BUT SHE STEALS.

329
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,930
HAS SHE ALWAYS
BEEN LIKE THAT?

330
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,960
I MEAN, HAS SHE ALWAYS...

331
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,500
THEY SAY SHE WAS ONCE
A GRAND LADY AND LIVED ON THE HILL.

332
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:57,070
BUT SHE TOOK TO READING BOOKS
AND WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE.

333
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:00,610
STUFFED HER HEAD FULL OF IDEAS,
AND NOW SHE'S A BIT ADDLED.

334
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,510
A BIT ADDLED?

335
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,850
OH, MOTHER, SHE'S CRAZY
AS A COCKROACH.

336
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,110
NO, SHE ISN'T.
SHE'S JUST DIFFERENT.

337
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:09,930
SHE'S FULL OF GOOD IDEAS
AND...AND WISDOM.

338
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,510
FULL OF WHAT?

339
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,520
AND EVERYBODY KNOWS SHE STEALS.

340
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,900
SHE STOLE THE COVER
OFF A GARBAGE BUCKET

341
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,010
FROM MRS. BOWER'S HOUSE.

342
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,690
AND THE NEXT NIGHT,
SHE PUT IT BACK.

343
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:22,990
SHE ALWAYS PUTS THINGS BACK
AFTER SHE TAKES THEM.

344
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,900
THAT'S WHY NOBODY BOTHERS.

345
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,630
SHE SHOULD BE LOCKED AWAY.

346
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:27,420
SHE'S MAD.

347
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,210
SHE SEEMED VERY
SENSIBLE TO ME.

348
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,750
OH! SHE SEEMED
SENSIBLE TO ELLA.

349

ARE CROWDING BACK ON ME,

438
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,930
THINGS I HAVEN'T
THOUGHT ABOUT FOR YEARS.

439
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,900
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON,
WHEN WE WERE RIDING THROUGH THE TOWN,

440
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:24,650
I KEPT REMEMBERING SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENED YEARS AGO.

441
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,180
I'D BEEN HOME
FOR THE HOLIDAYS

442
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,790
AND WAS LEAVING
TO RETURN TO SCHOOL.

443
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,570
MY CARRIAGE WAS HELD UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TOWN

444
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,440
BECAUSE SOMETHING WAS GOING
ON IN THE STREET AHEAD,

445
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,720
BLOCKING OUR PATH.

446
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,980
IT INVOLVED A CHILD...

447
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,110
A LITTLE GIRL OF ABOUT FIVE.

448
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:47,870
SHE WAS CRYING IN A SORT
OF TRAGIC FRENZY.

449
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,280
SHE'D RUN OUT OF HER HOUSE
IN THE PATH OF THE CARRIAGE,

450
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,650
AND SOME TOWNSPEOPLE WERE
TRYING TO HOLD HER BACK.

451
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,640
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT.

452
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,670
BUT ONE THING I'VE
REMEMBERED EVER SINCE

453
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,340
IN THE MOST MINUTE DETAIL...

454
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:08,160
SHE HAD GREAT, AGONIZED,
REBELLIOUS EYES...

455
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,580
FRINGED WITH DARK LASHES,
AND HER CHEEKS WERE WET WITH TEARS.

456
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,810
IT WAS THE MOST TRAGIC
FACE I EVER SAW.

457
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,770
NOT JUST SAD.

458
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,290
IT HAD THE AGONY
OF A GREEK TRAGEDY,

459
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,390
BEYOND HOPE OF COMFORTING.

460
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,940
I'VE NEVER KNOWN SORROW,

461
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:31,920
NOT REALLY.

462
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,790
BUT EVER SINCE THAT DAY,
I'VE FELT...

463
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,120
I'VE HAD SOME KNOWLEDGE
OF WHAT IT'S LIKE,

464
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,890
OF ALL THE HUMAN SOUL CAN

465
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:40,970
STAND OF

466
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,620
PAIN AND MISERY.

467
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,350
AND EVER SINCE THAT DAY,
I FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE

468
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,940
TO RESIST A WEEPING WOMAN.

469
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,640
AND IF SHE HAPPENS
TO HAVE EYES LIKE THAT,

470
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,080

473
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,430
THAT DAY I RAN AWAY
FROM HOME,

474
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:16,750
I STRIPPED TO THE BUFF
AND BATHED IN THIS POOL.

475

476
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,550

525
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,960
STOP MAKING FUN OF ME!

526
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,940

528
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,520
NARRATOR: THE PRINCE WAS CURIOUS,

529
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,730
SO HE SENT HIS VALET
AND HIS GOOD FRIEND KOVIN

530
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:32,840
INTO THE VILLAGE TO LEARN
WHAT THEY COULD LEARN

531
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,910
ABOUT THE RAGAMUFFIN
HE HAD MET THAT MORNING.

532
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:37,690
HE LEARNED THAT 
SHE WAS AN UNRULY GIRL,

533
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,350
ILL-MANNERED AND IMPUDENT,

534
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:41,710
FRIENDLESS,AND EVEN 
AN OBJECT OF RIDICULE,

535
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,830
FOR SHE WAS
IN THE HABIT OF BOASTING

536
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,650
THAT SHE WOULD LIVE
IN THE PALACE SOME DAY.

537
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,630
HE LEARNED THAT 
SHE WAS A GREAT TRIAL

538
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:50,910
TO HER STEPMOTHER
THE GOOD, KIND WIDOW SONDER.

539
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,020
ON THAT VERY AFTERNOON,
THE WIDOW AND HER DAUGHTERS

540
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,540
WERE ENTERTAINING
COUSIN LOULOU

541
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,040
WHO LIVED
ON THE FASHIONABLE HILL.

542
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,690
THE BEST ATTIRE
AND THE MOST ELEGANT MANNERS

543
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,100

AND WERE ON DISPLAY.

544
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,950
EVEN ELLA HAD BEEN ORDERED
TO PUT ON HER OTHER DRESS.

545
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,770
COUSIN LOULOU HAD STARTED LIFE

546
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:10,230
AS A VERY PRETTY HOUSEMAID
IN THE PALACE OF THE DUKE.

547
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,410
AND BY A NATURAL
SEQUENCE OF EVENTS,

548
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,860
PLUS A SMALL TRACE
OF THREATENED BLACKMAIL,

549
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,790
SHE HAD ACQUIRED JEWELS,
A HOUSE ON THE FASHIONABLE HILL,

550
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,930
AND A MEASURE
OF FINANCIAL SECURITY.

551
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,760
AS YOU CAN SEE,
ELLA WAS NOT PRECISELY

552
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,830
A SERVANT IN THE HOUSE,
BUT SHE WAS ALSO

553
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,870
NOT PRECISELY
A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY.

554
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:31,120
COUSIN LOULOU WAS RECEIVING
THE BEST THEY HAD TO GIVE

555
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,680
IN THE WAY OF ADULATION, AGREEMENT,
FLATTERY, AND BLANDISHMENT.

556
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:37,690
SHE WAS BEING OILED AND CODDLED,
SOAPED AND SALVED.

I--I CAN GET THEM.

570
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:14,590
I FORGOT THEM.
I LEFT THEM IN THE DELL.

I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT
YOUR FEELINGS EITHER.

MAY I SIT DOWN

578

HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

580
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,730
YOU'VE BEEN TELLING EVERYBODY
ABOUT IT FOR YEARS.

I DON'T HAVE TO.

THAT IF YOU WANTED TO,

00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,210
YOU COULD TELL ME
WHAT I THINK

606

AND WHAT I FEEL
AND ALL THAT.

ABOUT SO THAT
