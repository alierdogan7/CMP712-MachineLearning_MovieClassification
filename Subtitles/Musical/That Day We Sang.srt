Oh, yes.

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,512
# It's wrong to brag

357

# It's just cake in drag

358
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,037
# But it's gateau at the Berni Inn

359
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,358
# On my grave will be chipped
by a monumental mason

360

361

# Had a wife, had a child

362
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,953
# Had an avocado basin, bath

363

368
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,709
Sorry.

369
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,791
Can I just stop you a second.

370
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,359
We're leaving.

371
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,796
We don't want to spend any more time
with you this evening,

372
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,949
or ever.

373
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,679
You're not staying for coffee?
It's lrish coffee.

374
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,193
After dinner mints come with.

375
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,032
No, we're going for a nice cup of tea.

376
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,789
Tea?

377
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,756
I just felt he was belittling me. Well us.

378
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,832
He was trying, but we shall not be belittled.

379
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,675
We shall fight them in the chip shop!

380
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,194
We shall fight them in the Kardomah!

381
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,318
We shall never surrender!

382
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,313
(CHUCKLES) Sorry, that was a terrible
Diana Dors impression.

383
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,035
On the house.

384
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,429
-Anne, you're a bobby dazzler.
-I know I am.

385
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,040
-Help yourself.
-Oh, no. I'm full.

386
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,909
Anyway I'm on a diet supposedly.

387
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,034
I'm doing it with Pauline, the girl I work with.

388
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,588
She wants to lose three stone
and take all her hems up.

389
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,669
She's got chunky knees.

390
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,953
Well, yours aren't chunky, if I may say.

391
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,836
No, but office solidarity.

392
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,355
You were very manly in there,
when you took charge.

393
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,590
No, I surprised myself.

394
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,035
Don't know what's going on with me
at the moment.

395
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,872
"It's all happening!" (CHUCKLES)

396
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,188
Didn't I hear you say
that your mother had just died?

397
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,599
Yes, she did.

398
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,750
-And did you live with her?
-Yes.

399
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,712
House to myself now.

400
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,950
So thank god for this place!

401
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,351
But she didn't like music.

402
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,873
She struggled.

403
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,315
She found life a bit of an obstacle course.

404
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,715
Well, it is.

405
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,834
-Actually, do you mind if l...
-No, please. I may have over vinegared.

406
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,070
-Oh, not for me. I love vinegar.
-(CHUCKLES)

407
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,360
-So, your office is in Peel House.
-Mmm.

408
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,393
I've got clients on the fourth floor.

409
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,630
My office is just across the square.

410
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,550
-We're on the first floor, Stanley Brothers...
-Hmm...

411
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,631
Pop in some time. Pauline loves a visitor.

412
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,314
Right. I shall. I shall pop!

413
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,474
Please.

414
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,918
Are you Jimmy Baker?

415
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,433
-Yeah.
-ls your mother in?

416
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,833
-No, she's at her other job.
-All right.

417
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,319
Well, how you doing?

418
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,274
-Have you been out playing?
-Singing, I am in a choir.

419
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,555
I sing, with a dance band.

420
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,951
We've been on the wireless.

421
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,395
So I have actually sung on the wireless.

422
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,794
I gave you a rubber ball once,
you remember?

423
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,912
You would have been about three.

424
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,558
It was a big coloured ball.

425
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,189
Have you not still got it?

426
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,998
-I had better go in.
-Hang on a minute.

427
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,712
I am off to Canada.

428
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,590
Pastures new, as they say.

429
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,510
Have you heard that?
Pastures new? No?

430
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,959
Anyway,

431
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,671
I'm leaving this behind.

432
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,318
Do you want to take it?

433
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,470
-What is it?
-It's a gramophone.

434
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,152
Go on, take it.

435
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,595
-Who have I to give it to?
-No-one. You.

436
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,113
It's for you.

437
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,234
It's new.

438
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,839
There's a record in it, Happiness Street,

439
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,913
I'm singing on it.

440
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,350
-All right, Sal?
-What's this?

441
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,838
I'm sailing to Canada.
I've brought him this.

442
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,309
Right.

443
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,114
I'll send you my address, shall l?

444
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,953
Well, I will.

445
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,636
Jimmy, go and get washed.

446
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,233
And remember...

447
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,110
Always hold the record by its edges.
Yes?

448
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,872
Is this all right, Mam?

449
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,313
Yeah. Go on.

Well, I'll probably not see you.

No.

453
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,631
You know how I'm fixed.

454
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,955
Yeah.

455
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,070
-ls she going with you?
-Yes.

456
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,393
It makes sense.

457
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,433
Course it does.

458
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,633
You bugger.

00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,392
-Mam!
-Wait!

460
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,319
What did he say?

461
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,079
-Who?
-Him.

462
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,793
Nothing. He said he'd given me
a ball or something.

463
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,074
A ball.

464
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,753
He didn't say to come with him
or anything, to Canada?

465
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,558
-No.
-No.

466
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,034
You're staying with me, aren't you?

467
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,918
Mam, can we play the record?

468
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,433
No, I told you.

469
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,518
-But why?
-Because I don't want to hear it.

470
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,193
Now fasten it up.

471
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,077
You don't get it out,
you don't show it anybody.

472
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,072
And you don't tell anybody. I mean it!

473
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,476
She said, "Pop in".

474
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,471
She wants me to pop in.

475
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,557
I'm not making this up, am l?

476
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,349
She wants me, Tubby Baker,

477

to come and see her in her office.

478
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,236

We've done the chairs, Mr Kirkby.

524
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,675
-You all right, Mr Kirkby?
-It's this leg.

525
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,035
Gets bad in the cold. Just need a minute.

526
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,997
Do you want me to go and tell you
when the bus is coming

527
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,229
then you don't have to stand in the cold?

528
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,709
I walk home.
I'm only down Pattison Street.

529
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,314
That's near me. I can walk with you, sir.

530
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,436
I don't think you walk as slow as me.

531
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,080
I can do.
I like walking slow.

532
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,515
And if I walk on the side ofyour cold leg

533
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,797
it might warm it up
and then it might feel better.

534
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,515
You can lean on me. I'm dead strong.

535
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,751
I'm always carrying coal and spuds
and that, for mam.

536
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,992
Come on, Tubby!

537
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,479
Hello!

538
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,834
Oh! You came.

539
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,033
Pauline, this is Tubby. Remember I told you,
from the programme.

540
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,758
Tubby Baker.
Very pleased to meet you Pauline.

541
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,638
Oh, don't be. I'm only a lowly secretary.

542
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,073
Enid is the PA.

543
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,116
She has the desk planner
and the intercom.

544
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,794
And what have I got?
Some Handy Andies and a plastic lemon.

545
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,110
We're on lemon and hot water.
I told you we're slimming.

546
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,033
-How's it going?
-PAULlNE: This week, not great.

547
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,470
I can have 7,000 calories a week.

548
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:17,031
And so far I've had 3,800
and it's only Tuesday.

549
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,153
But hey, two days on potted meat
and water biscuits,

550
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,515
-that could level me back off.
-(TUBBY CHUCKLES)

551
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,397
Speaking of chips, where are you taking her?

552
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,231
Are you not escorting her to lunch?

553
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,311
-Well, of course...
-Pauline, it's Tuesday.

554
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,628
I was thinking of having a sandwich.

555
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,154
Can I interest you in sitting on a bench?
In the square?

556
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,120
-No, I don't have time.
-No, fair enough.

557
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,555
Well, I won't clog up
the mighty wheels of commerce.

558
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,198
Very pleased to have met you Pauline.

559
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,670
Enid's got a lot more leeway
than me calorie-wise.

560
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,718
She can have a jacket potato and a yoghurt.

561
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,518
I don't think I've ever had a yoghurt.

562
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,151
PAULlNE: No, you don't look like
you've ever had one.

563
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,152
No offence, you're like me.
It's all in front.

564
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,356
Be thankful you don't have to struggle
into a roll-on.

565
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,839
(CHUCKLES) I am.

566
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,311
Have you given up answering that intercom?

567
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,231
I didn't hear it, it didn't buzz.

568
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,788
My wife says can you
get this stitched for Hilary,

569
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,236
she says it's the band on the inside.
Who's this?

570
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,675
My name's Baker. Blackfriars Assurance.

571
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,591
We're insured so sayonara.

572
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,875
No, I just popped in to see Miss Sutcliffe.

573
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,030
Oh, well, you can pop out,
she's busy.

574
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,070
Goodbye. Bye, Pauline.

575
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,918
These need doing.

576
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,434
Give me a knock in 10
and we'll make a move.

577
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,313
PAULlNE: So...

578
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,435
What?

579
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,953
Mr Tubby Baker.

580
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,359
Very nice.

581
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,069
Very gentlemanly.

582
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,193
He's a gentleman caller,

583
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,194
Iike in that play where she had
the gammy leg and the glass animals.

584
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,838
Why did you give him the brush off?

585
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,036
We have our site visits on a Tuesday.

586
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,157
I've heard that something very exciting
is happening the day after Tuesday.

587
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,593
-What?
-Wednesday.

588
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,189
Get a bit of a romance going.

589
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,272
-I'd have him.
-You're married.

590
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,476
There's always something dragging you back.

591
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,513
-What was he after?
-Nothing.

592
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,999
You don't know him?

593
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,152
-No.
-Good.

594
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:17,153
Oh, thanks for doing the riding hat, huh.
Get me out of bother.

595
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,592
Who have you spotted now?

596
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,636
PAULlNE: Mr Tubby.

597
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,551
Aw, he's walking away all sad.

598
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,878
Will you not just have a butty with him?

599
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,234
No!

603
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,473
She will have lunch with you.

-What are you doing? Stop.

you'd know about it.

do you know what would happen?

-No, sir.
-Get your head blown off.

Now, the audience is all seated

625

so we should be going on
to the stage very shortly.

626
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,796
And we won't be nervous,
because we will not think about ourselves.

627
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,952
We will think about the music
and the pleasure it brings.

I didn't know which flavour,
so I got them all.

You didn't get plain?

734
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,472
-I didn't know there was plain.
-I can only have plain.

735
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,155
-I never saw plain.
-lf it's not plain it's not slimming.

Look, leave that aside for the moment.

737
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,510

that first thing tomorrow.

-Yeah?

I can't just cut and run.

761
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,473
Well, maybe I should cut and run.

762
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,714
Run where? You're no spring chicken.

00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,033

-We will.

00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,556
He's just gone into Duncan and Fosters.

872
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,470
God, Enid! Go and find him,

873
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:43,154
tell him you've been a bloody idiot
and you want to go out with him.

874
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,794
-Shall l?
-Yes!

875
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,632
Go on, hurry up.

876
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,318
What shall I tell him about Malcolm?

877
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,110
Just tell him, it is 1969! For frig's sake!

878
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,713
What it is.

879
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,438
That's not really a sentence.

880
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,598
-Thank you for the photo.
-Oh! No trouble.

881
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:22,994
The other day when I said I was going out
with somebody, I wasn't really.

882
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:26,277
So I don't know ifyou want to, still,
go out with me.

883
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,109
Well, I can't just decide on the spot,
I will have to think about it.

884
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,430
No, of course. Absolutely.

885
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:38,229
I've thought about it.
Yes, I would and where shall we go?

886
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:41,073
Oh! Oh, you really want to?

887
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:45,870
You've no idea. You have no idea.

888
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,029
Wow!

889
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,194
Crikey!

890
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:55,271
I ordered sausage egg and chips
to cheer myself up. I could send it back!

891
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,834
(SlGHS)

892
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,519
Could I hold your hand?

893
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,309
Yes.

894
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,753
Hang on! Let's do this thing properly.

895
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,474
So,

896
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,632
none of my beeswax, but I am a man

897
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,757
so obviously a bit thick
as regards these matters.

898
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,719
Were you going out with somebody or not?

899
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,314
-Well, I was seeing somebody.
-Oh!

900
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,356
We didn't really go out.

901
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,634
And I haven't actually told him yet,

902
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,870
he'll probably be furious
but we're used to that.

903
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,315
-Who's we?
-Oh, me and Pauline.

904
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,594
It's my boss.

905
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:37,150
That's who I've been sort of seeing.
You met him that day.

906
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:40,718
Oh! I thought he was married.

907
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:45,039
Well, yes. That's been the complication.

908
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,633
-The boss I met? Mr Stanley?
-Yes.

909
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,637
But he is married, I heard him saying
something about his wife.

910
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,188
They don't get on.
They're all very show jumpy.

911
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,192
-Who are?
-The wife and the daughters.

912
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:04,194
-He's got daughters?
-Yes. Two. They do dressage.

913
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,991
But you haven't had an affair with him?

914
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,874
Well, yes.

915
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:20,069
Well, what did you think
you were doing to them?

916
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,358
What I was doing?

917
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,872
To their family.

918
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,433
You had no right.

919
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,438
He was somebody's husband.

920
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,191
And he was somebody's father.

921
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,996
That's wrong, Enid. That's just...

922
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,599
I'm sorry, I can't hold hands with you.

923
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,075
I had no idea that you...

924
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,438
I thought you were like me.

925
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,398
I thought you'd missed the boat somehow.

926
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,794
Getting involved with a married man.

927
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,478
That's not who I thought you were.

928
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,630
Stephenson, Sutcliffe, Taylor,

929
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,075
Ward, Williamson, Yardley.

930
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,432
Right.

931
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,239
Have a look around at your tram group.

932
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,918
If you don't see those faces
at the tram stop tomorrow morning,

933
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,718
you are on the wrong tram,

934
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:36,517
and you will not be making a record
with the Halle orchestra. Oi!

935
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,352
That was a waste of a ha'penny,
wasn't it, Hewitt?

936
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:49,799
These trams have been put on specially
for you to get to the Free Trade Hall.

937
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:54,556
We don't want anybody coming on milk floats
or getting lifts on a dust cart.

938
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,119
Yes, Baker, I'm looking at you.

(CHlLDREN TlTTERlNG)

940
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,596
You're not on the tram,
you're not coming in.

941
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:05,995
In fact, I am going to say
that anyone not arriving on time

942
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:10,353
will not only be prevented from taking part
in the recording, but will be asked

943
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,396
to leave the choir altogether.

(CHlLDREN CLAMOURlNG)

945
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:18,632
Singing tomorrow is going to be
the happiest moment of my life.

946
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:23,029
Very good. You get off.
Big day tomorrow. I can manage.

947
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,669
So our record that we're making Mr Kirkby,

948
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,797
if they sell it in Woolworths,
I'm going to buy it for mam and play it her.

949
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,752
Play it her on what? A mangle?

950
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,791
No, I've got a gramophone.

951
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,632
Yes, and I'm Rupert the Bear.

952
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,871
No, I have got one.
Come on, Mr Kirkby, come with!

953
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,399
Very nice model.

954
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,156

"Laying up treasures on earth

957

And a record come with it.

958
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,516
Shall I put it on so we know
how we have to do it tomorrow?

959
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,750
-Are you allowed to play it?
-Yeah.

and I'm going to play you it on it.

986

You're not making a record.

988
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,159
He's not making a record.

989
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,514
He's down there now, on a bench.

990
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,473
-Who?
-Tubby.

991
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:46,079
He's having... I can't see if it's a pie or a pasty.

992
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,071
I think it's a pasty.

993
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,476
I might go and sit in the sun.

994
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,630
Don't say anything to him,
he's made his point.

995
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:58,599
I'm not going to say anything to him.
I'm not totally crass.

She's just a person. Bit lonely.

01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,590
Probably been dumped a few times.
Picked a wrong 'un.

We all make mistakes.

1003

But I am. Same with Enid.

1004
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:32,991
And what have you done
with your life that's so great?

1005
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,995
You're not Albert Schweitzer.

1006
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:40,073
Unless you're running a leper colony
of a weekend and keeping that under wraps.

1007
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,956
Would it be possible to have a word?

1008
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:12,032
I'm the first to wade in
when there's been a misdemeanour.

1009
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,872
Bang. Ears boxed.

1010
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:16,918
"Punished with everlasting destruction."
Thessalonians 1 :9.

1011
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,669
Joke.

1012
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:23,314
And obviously playing the gramophone
when you'd said he wasn't to,

1013
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,356
-needs a punishment.
-He's getting a punishment.

1014
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,796
"Correct thy son and he shall give thee rest."
Proverbs 29:17.

1015
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,199
We're on the same tram tracks here.

1016
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,679
I don't believe in God.

1017
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,154
It's just that he had this surprise for you

1018
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:42,313
and I was going to take him out to tea,
possibly the Kardomah.

1019
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,630
Because he's been a help to me.
I've got this leg...

1020
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,590
-...Iack of.
-What surprise?

1021
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,875
It's a photograph of Baker.

1022
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,953
I took a little snap of him.

1023
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,793
I borrowed a Box Brownie
from a chap in my digs.

1024
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:58,553
He didn't want you to think
you had to buy the, the big one.

1025
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,916
Because that's going to be sizeable.

1026
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:06,395
So I thought after the recording,
with it being a day off,

1027
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:11,759
we could get the photo, and then maybe
go somewhere, as I say, like the Kardomah.

1028
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:16,711
Have egg on toast or beans on toast, or toast.

1029
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,113
Make a day of it.

1030
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,239
He's a good little lad.

1031
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,720
You know he's saving up
to buy you the record.

1032
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,675
I don't suppose you want a cup of tea
with a non-believer.

1033
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,918
Well, you believe in tea,

1034
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,753
and to me that's only just outside
the Holy Trinity.

1035
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:40,149
Our Lord, Holy Spirit, Jesus, tea.

01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,193
Once through for luck.

1205
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,595
I didn't get a chance to ask, are we all here?

1206
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:38,033
Apart from Baker.

1207
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:41,836
Baker? But he was so excited about it.

1208
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:45,757
-Did he send a message?
-No, just didn't turn up.

1209
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:47,634
So he is out.

1210
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,551
Well, I am very disappointed.

1211
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,631
I had great hopes of Baker.

1212
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:55,839
Aren't you disappointed?

1213
01:15:58,360 --> 01:15:59,679
Very disappointed!

1214
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:12,480

-Yep.

1218
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:28,711
And you were right what you said
about pasties and leper colonies.

1219
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:32,349
Was l? Bought her a plant?
Lovely, she's in a meeting.

1220
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:34,908
No, it's for him.
It's him I've come to see. The boss.

-Oh, blimey!
-There'll be no trouble.

1222
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:40,111
We just need to set things straight,
the three of us. To move forward.

You can't lay new lino over a dead cat.

1224
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:44,912
Now, tell him he's got a visitor.

01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,434
Use the intercom
if you don't want to go in there.

It won't take long he says! Over!

For crying out loud. Hang on.

What? Pauline, I'm in a meeting,
you lardy trout. Wha...

Oh, insurance? Hop it.

1233
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:13,996
I just wanted a quick word with you
about Enid and myself.

1234

What are you talking about?

1235
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,073
Pauline, get Roberts.

1236
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:20,237
Enid and I are in love.

Yes, we're in love.

MALCOLM: (OVER lNTERCOM)
And why are you telling me?

1239
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:29,032
Oh, because I have to assume
that you have feelings for her as well.

1240
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,951
And that you want the best for her.

1241

MALCOLM: Are we talking
about Enid Sutcliffe?

1242

TUBBY: Yes.

1243
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,991
Why do you think I care
one way or the other about her?

1244
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:39,114
Because I know what the situation is.

1245
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:42,596
Get out of here, you fat fool.

1246
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:45,869
Coming shouting the odds in your cheap suit.

1247
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:47,279
No-one's shouting.

1248
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:51,319
Can we not just shake hands like gentlemen?
For Enid's sake.

1249
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:53,917
Enid's nothing to me!

1250
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:56,350
She's a spinster with a crush, that's all.

1251
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:59,034
-Whatever she's told you.
-How dare you?

1252
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:03,271
You've had what you wanted
for years and years

1253
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:06,079
and you say she's nothing to you.

1254

Well, no contest.

-No.

-No!

You did Mr Kirkby.
We had a whole conversation about it.

1312
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:50,316
I might have been hallucinating.

-Hallucinating?
-From shell shock.

I want to run away with her.

-Probably not.

Of which me shoving him in the chest

1323
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:21,830
and failing to give him a cactus
is the last in a long line.

1324

Well, she's only on the first floor.

grab a decorator's ladder
and put it up against her window,

1328
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,391

01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:56,954
# So would you

1373
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:00,469
# Or could you...

1374
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:09,115
# Come away with me?

1375
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,637
# All the shame, all the sadness

1376
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:16,598
# Of all of the roads we have travelled

1377
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:19,756
# Weaves a garment that hangs on us

1378
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:22,638
# Heavy as rope

1379
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:25,109
# But strand by strand

1380
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:28,308
# It can be unravelled

1381
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:31,149
# Hand in hand

1382
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:33,151
# There's hope

1383
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:37,030
# Nymphs and shepherds, come away

1384
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:41,950
# Nymphs and shepherds, come away

1385
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:45,119
# Who's to blame for my flat little life

1386
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:46,754
# Me only

1387
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:50,200
# Chose a lover who stuck with his wife

1388
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,153
# That's lonely

1389
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:56,913
# You turned up and I couldn't believe

1390
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:02,795
# Sweet and kind
with your heart on your sleeve

1391
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:07,791
# I will come

1392
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:12,672
# I will come

1393
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:18,191
# Come away

1394
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:21,434
# With you

1395
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,353
# All the shame, all the blame

1396
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:30,637
# All the stuff we are dragging behind us

1397
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:33,153
# We should turn, we should look

1398
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:34,912
# We should give it a shove

1399
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:39,513
# We ditch the chains

1400
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:42,319
# There's nothing to bind us

1401
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:46,712
# And what remains, is love

1402
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:51,119
# Nymphs and shepherds, come away

1403
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:55,516
# Nymphs and shepherds, come away

1404
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:58,508
# Come away

1405
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,794
# All those years at the back of the queue

1406
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:04,269
# Don't seem real

1407
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:07,318
# All those dreams that were never on view

1408
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,709
# We'll reveal

1409
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:12,997
# All we felt that we didn't deserve

1410
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:18,435
# Hand in hand we can summon the nerve

1411
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:24,556
# To feel love

1412
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:29,392
# And give love

1413
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:34,198
# Till those dreams

1414
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:38,158
# Come true

1415
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:41,630
# Nymphs and shepherds, come away

1416
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:46,630
# Nymphs and shepherds, come away#
