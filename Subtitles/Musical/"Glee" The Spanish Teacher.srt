(school bell ringing)

19
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:40,848
William...

20
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:42,267
What do you mean,
you received complaints?

21
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:44,435
Who complained?
I can't tell you that.

22
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:47,171
But I can tell you that
your teaching skills

23
00:00:47,222 --> 00:00:49,557
have been seriously
brought into question.

24
00:00:49,642 --> 00:00:51,726
Look, I-I know I'm not
a native Spanish speaker.

25
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,811
Sometimes I get a little
tripped up with the...
William.

26
00:00:53,862 --> 00:00:55,813
Will you please remove
that enormous sombrero

27
00:00:55,864 --> 00:00:57,615
so I can break
it down for you.

28
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,817
As you may have heard,

29
00:00:59,868 --> 00:01:01,319
our history teacher,
Mrs. Hagberg,

30
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,488
has been forced into retirement

31
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,239
due to some memory problems.

32
00:01:05,324 --> 00:01:09,661
And that's how Germany
won the Second World War.

33
00:01:09,712 --> 00:01:11,996
Hagberg was a tenured
teacher at this school

34
00:01:12,047 --> 00:01:13,548
for over 40 years.

35
00:01:13,632 --> 00:01:17,168
Her departure means there's
an open tenured position

36
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:18,336
here at McKinley.

37
00:01:18,387 --> 00:01:20,505
Oh, Principal Figgins...

38
00:01:20,556 --> 00:01:21,973
Emma and I just got engaged.

39
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,258
We'll be starting a family soon.
I need that tenure.

40
00:01:24,343 --> 00:01:26,561
And I would love
to give it to you, William.

41
00:01:26,645 --> 00:01:28,596
But you're only one
of several teachers

42
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:30,815
I'm considering
for this position.

43
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,318
And to be frank, you have
a public relations problem.

44
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,069
If you want the tenure,

45
00:01:35,154 --> 00:01:36,387
you've got to turn it
around in the class.

46
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:38,222
O-Okay.
How do I do that?

47
00:01:38,273 --> 00:01:39,490
You're a Spanish teacher.

48
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,275
Maybe you should try
learning Spanish.

49
00:01:45,597 --> 00:01:46,564
(school bell ringing)

50
00:01:46,615 --> 00:01:47,832
Señor Martinez?

51
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:51,235
You can call me David.

52
00:01:51,286 --> 00:01:52,587
David, I am thrilled

53
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:54,905
that Spanish has so many
different ways to say

54
00:01:54,957 --> 00:01:58,075
"to be," but right now
what I need to do

55
00:01:58,127 --> 00:02:00,178
is to learn how to say,

56
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,047
"Stop using my toilet,"
to my maid.

57
00:02:03,098 --> 00:02:05,967
I was hoping you could tell me
what the word "gordita" means.

58
00:02:06,051 --> 00:02:08,419
I know we're all here
for different reasons.

59
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,087
Most of you need your GEDs,

60
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,023
some of you want to
go to Cabo San Lucas

61
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:13,608
and order like a local.

62
00:02:13,692 --> 00:02:16,694
But did you know that the U.S.
census believe that by 2030

63
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:19,030
the majority of Americans
will use Spanish

64
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,598
as their first language?

65
00:02:20,649 --> 00:02:22,533
You're not here
learning a language.

66
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:25,703
You're here 'cause you're smart.
And you're forward thinkers.

67
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,121
I'm sorry. I'm trying to listen,

68
00:02:27,206 --> 00:02:28,373
but you got some
beautiful teeth.

69
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,273
(chuckles)

70
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,168
<i>Asi que repiten conmigo.</i>

71
00:02:40,252 --> 00:02:41,085
Come on, repeat with me.

72
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,680
(school bell rings)

73
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:54,148
DAVID:
Very good. Thank you so much.

74
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:56,100
Remember, roll those "R"s.
(rolling "R"s)

75
00:02:56,151 --> 00:02:57,968
(rolling "R"s)
Exactly.

76
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,070
Hey, I'm Will Schuester.

77
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,355
I teach Spanish here
during the day.

78
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,641
<i>Can I buy you a cup of café?</i>

79
00:03:03,692 --> 00:03:04,975
(laughing):
Sure.

80
00:03:05,027 --> 00:03:06,611
There's something kind of
fun and rebellious

81
00:03:06,662 --> 00:03:07,745
about being here at night.

82
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,714
It's depressing.

83
00:03:09,782 --> 00:03:11,649
No offense.
No. No, um...

84
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,818
Why don't you get a job
teaching regular high school?

85
00:03:13,869 --> 00:03:15,720
Have you seen the news?
Budgets are being cut,

86
00:03:15,788 --> 00:03:17,355
there's a hiring freeze...

87
00:03:22,594 --> 00:03:24,729
You know, could you maybe
say that a little slower?

88
00:03:24,797 --> 00:03:26,380
I think your accent's
throwing me off.

89
00:03:26,465 --> 00:03:27,765
W-Where you from?
Ohio.

90
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,667
But my parents are from Chile,

91
00:03:29,718 --> 00:03:31,469
and we only spoke Spanish
in the house, growing up.

92
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,937
Oh.

93
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,005
How-how long have you been,
uh, working here?

94
00:03:35,057 --> 00:03:36,858
Just a few months.
This is...

95
00:03:36,942 --> 00:03:38,976
actually the beginning
of my career change.

96
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:41,679
For the last six years,
I was a tooth model.

97
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,364
It's like a hand model,
but with your teeth.

98
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,684
Man, your teeth
are really white.

99
00:03:46,735 --> 00:03:49,570
Yeah, no coffee,
no cigarettes, no beets.

100
00:03:49,655 --> 00:03:51,038
I was the top tooth model
in the country.

101
00:03:51,123 --> 00:03:53,574
Colgate, Crest Whitestrips,
Sensodyne...

102
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:54,826
Whenever they needed a smile
for their advertisement,

103
00:03:54,877 --> 00:03:56,577
they would call on
Dave Martinez.

104
00:03:56,662 --> 00:03:58,496
Wow, that sounds like
a great gig.

105
00:03:58,547 --> 00:04:00,364
What... why'd you stop?

106
00:04:00,415 --> 00:04:01,716
Well, one day I...

107
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,368
I realized I was spending
so much time flossing, I...

108
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:06,704
I was missing my life.
I want to make a difference

109
00:04:06,755 --> 00:04:08,089
that lasts longer
than a grin, you know?

110
00:04:08,173 --> 00:04:10,641
I-I want to teach kids.

111
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,344
I want to give them
something useful.

112
00:04:13,395 --> 00:04:15,813
Something they can...
they can take with them

113
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,214
their whole lives.

114
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:18,683
<i>I want to help them
find their duende.</i>

115
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,984
<i>You know duende, right?</i>

116
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,051
Of course.

117
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:22,753
<i>Duende, yeah.</i>

118
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:24,655
Now, you also teach
Glee Club, right?

119
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,908
I do.
You see, that's...
that's inspiring.

120
00:04:26,992 --> 00:04:29,861
I actually wanted to try forming
the night school Glee Club,

121
00:04:29,912 --> 00:04:32,029
but meeting after school
means 2:00 in the morning.

122
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,998
Ah, right.
(laughs)
I love to sing.

123
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,735
<i>I actually learned English
watching reruns of Solid Gold.</i>

124
00:04:37,786 --> 00:04:38,870
Wait. You're serious?

125
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:40,505
Yeah. They-they've done
studies on it.

126
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:43,207
The brain takes in information,
like a new language,

127
00:04:43,258 --> 00:04:45,843
or a math equation,
much more quickly

128
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,745
and retains it better,
when that information

129
00:04:47,813 --> 00:04:49,347
is delivered through music.

130
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,583
<i>Well, there's a lot of
duende involved, too.</i>

131
00:04:54,052 --> 00:04:55,753
You know what I would do
if I was teaching Glee Club?

132
00:04:55,804 --> 00:04:57,638
Latin music. Think about it.

133
00:04:57,723 --> 00:04:59,390
You get those kids
singing in Spanish,

134
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,625
and they'll be
learning the language

135
00:05:00,692 --> 00:05:02,627
without even realizing it.

136
00:05:02,694 --> 00:05:05,246
<i>WILL:
If I could have some of my
Glee kids speaking Spanish</i>

137
00:05:05,314 --> 00:05:07,932
<i>by the end of the week, it'd be
a hell of an accomplishment.</i>

138
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,184
<i>That's Teacher of the Year
stuff.</i>

139
00:05:10,252 --> 00:05:12,470
Twice a day, you boys stain

140
00:05:12,538 --> 00:05:15,156
your mother's drapes,
or befoul a gym sock

141
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,158
that has to jump from the hamper
straight into therapy.

142
00:05:17,242 --> 00:05:18,993
SUE:
Why not head on down
to the clinic,

143
00:05:19,077 --> 00:05:21,495
and put your virile
teen years to good use?

144
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,381
You'll have five bucks more
than when you walked in,

145
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,250
and the gratitude of
lonely ovaries everywhere.

146
00:05:26,301 --> 00:05:28,219
But not you. You can
keep tossing your tissues

147
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,304
into the trash.
I was in an accident.

148
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:32,740
Still. Same goes for you,
Porcelain.

149
00:05:32,808 --> 00:05:34,792
Let the strangeness
end with you.

150
00:05:34,843 --> 00:05:37,011
What's going on, Sue?

151
00:05:37,095 --> 00:05:40,014
Well, William, I'm just
trying to instill

152
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:41,799
the spirit of giving
in your students.

153
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,435
No, honestly, I, uh...

154
00:05:44,486 --> 00:05:47,605
was a little bit dismayed
by the quality of men

155
00:05:47,656 --> 00:05:49,740
holding Dixie cups
down at the sperm bank

156
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,125
this morning.

157
00:05:51,193 --> 00:05:52,526
Zero viable options.

158
00:05:52,611 --> 00:05:54,996
<i>Looked like the cast from
Ice Road Truckers.</i>

159
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,915
So I thought it'd be best
if I found a sperm donor here.

160
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,200
H-Hold on a second.

161
00:05:59,284 --> 00:06:00,251
You're serious?

162
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,953
Yes, William.

163
00:06:02,004 --> 00:06:04,005
I have decided to have a child.

164
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:05,673
(laughs)

165
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,542
Um, wow.

166
00:06:08,627 --> 00:06:10,761
I guess I just never saw you
as the mothering type.

167
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,513
Well, I resent that, William.

168
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:14,615
I have a very strong
mothering instinct.

169
00:06:14,683 --> 00:06:16,350
I had it with my sister.

170
00:06:16,435 --> 00:06:17,885
I have it with Becky Jackson.

171
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,222
I like to think I play
a parenting role in her life.

172
00:06:21,306 --> 00:06:25,059
And like so many women who
chose career over family,

173
00:06:25,143 --> 00:06:27,878
I've decided to take my life
in a different direction

174
00:06:27,946 --> 00:06:30,848
while there's still time.

175
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:32,149
Are you sure
that's even possible?

176
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,402
Yes, William, I am sure.

177
00:06:34,486 --> 00:06:38,072
You see, I had my eggs
frozen in the late '70s.

178
00:06:38,156 --> 00:06:40,741
They didn't even have that
technology in the late '70s.

179
00:06:40,826 --> 00:06:43,327
I know.
I did it myself.

180
00:06:43,378 --> 00:06:46,497
Oh...
The good people at Kroger
have been keeping a box

181
00:06:46,548 --> 00:06:48,332
of my championship ova

182
00:06:48,383 --> 00:06:49,834
cooling in their meat locker.

183
00:06:49,885 --> 00:06:51,252
And what with
the financial security

184
00:06:51,336 --> 00:06:53,721
that will be afforded me
by the end of the week...

185
00:06:53,805 --> 00:06:56,040
I am finally ready

186
00:06:56,091 --> 00:06:58,426
to start a family.

187
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,061
Now, I don't know if
you've heard, William,

188
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:01,228
but there's a tenured position

189
00:07:01,313 --> 00:07:02,980
opening up at our school.

190
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,349
And I'm a shoe-in.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

191
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,052
What makes you so sure you're
the one who's gonna get tenure?

192
00:07:08,103 --> 00:07:09,553
Seniority, William.

193
00:07:09,604 --> 00:07:11,939
I'm first in line, and also,
I'm a proven champion.

194
00:07:12,024 --> 00:07:15,910
And now seeing as how I find
bald infants terrifying,

195
00:07:15,994 --> 00:07:17,995
I'm going to need a few
ounces of your baby gravy

196
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,865
to ensure Sue Sylvester Jr. is
born with a full head of hair.

197
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,616
Coach?

198
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:26,170
Principal Figgins wants to
see you in his office.

199
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:29,040
Looks like I got my tenure.

200
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:31,509
Cheerleading magazines
are right here.

201
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,410
Have fun.

202
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,717
Complaints?

203
00:07:39,768 --> 00:07:42,219
Who's complaining about
my teaching style?

204
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,355
I can't tell you that, Sue.

205
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,223
A student who shall
remain anonymous.

206
00:07:46,274 --> 00:07:47,274
Well, then, who's this?

207
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:50,778
Sue, this is the talented
and enchanting

208
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:52,947
Olympian Roz Washington.

209
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:54,165
Coach of the McKinley

210
00:07:54,232 --> 00:07:56,200
synchronized swimming team.

211
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,486
Roz approached me with
some constructive criticism

212
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,071
about your lagging Cheerios!

213
00:08:00,122 --> 00:08:01,539
Why should I listen
to this woman

214
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,773
give me notes

215
00:08:02,824 --> 00:08:04,158
about my Cheerios?

216
00:08:04,242 --> 00:08:06,410
Because Cheerios! didn't
win Nationals last year, Sue.

217
00:08:06,461 --> 00:08:09,613
And remember, you're on my short
list for the tenured position.

218
00:08:09,664 --> 00:08:11,549
And tenured teachers
are team players.

219
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,135
Well, let me tell you
why ticket sales are down

220
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:16,504
at sporting events.
This school got cheerleaders

221
00:08:16,588 --> 00:08:18,973
doing broke-ass moves
from the 1950s.

222
00:08:19,057 --> 00:08:20,891
Hm.
Why don't you just admit

223
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,460
that you're past your
competitive edge, Sue Sylvester,

224
00:08:23,512 --> 00:08:24,562
and let this young

225
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:28,482
bronze-medal winner
add some crunk

226
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:30,401
to the ba-dunk-a-dunk?

227
00:08:32,687 --> 00:08:34,655
(school bell ringing)

228
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,656
WILL:
All right, guys!

229
00:08:35,741 --> 00:08:37,108
Let me ask you something.

230
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:40,244
Where do you think you'll
be in the year 2030?

231
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,996
RACHEL & KURT:
Broadway. Twinsies!

232
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,614
Walking.

233
00:08:43,665 --> 00:08:44,999
In jail, or dead. Or both.

234
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,500
WILL:
Wherever you are,

235
00:08:46,585 --> 00:08:48,786
whatever you're doing, you're
going to need to be able

236
00:08:48,837 --> 00:08:51,288
to speak Spanish.
The reality is, by 2030,

237
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:52,673
more people on this planet

238
00:08:52,758 --> 00:08:55,059
will be speaking Spanish
than any other language.

239
00:08:55,127 --> 00:08:57,094
The world is changing.
Our culture is changing.

240
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,963
And that needs to be
reflected in here.

241
00:08:59,014 --> 00:09:00,664
So for our next assignment,
we're only doing songs

242
00:09:00,715 --> 00:09:04,501
written or performed by someone
Latin, or of Latin descent.

243
00:09:04,553 --> 00:09:06,353
Or English songs
performed bilingually.

244
00:09:06,438 --> 00:09:07,938
Ooh, I'm bilingual.

245
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,340
, Mr. Shue, though I love
that we're finally getting

246
00:09:10,392 --> 00:09:13,227
all Lima Sound Machine
in here, why now?

247
00:09:13,311 --> 00:09:15,279
Oh, Santana,
because it's long overdue.

248
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:18,065
The truth is,
I love all things Latin.

249
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:20,484
I mean, I love Latin food,

250
00:09:20,535 --> 00:09:21,902
Latin art, Latin people...

251
00:09:21,987 --> 00:09:23,988
You don't know any Latin people.
(knocking)

252
00:09:30,212 --> 00:09:32,129
I know. Um...
Guys, this is David Martinez.

253
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,197
David Martinez,
this is the Glee Club.

254
00:09:33,248 --> 00:09:34,248
RACHEL:
Oh, my God.

255
00:09:34,332 --> 00:09:35,699
Cutest...
...smile...

256
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,201
...ever.

257
00:09:37,252 --> 00:09:39,587
Hello, everyone.

258
00:09:39,671 --> 00:09:40,671
It's a pleasure.

259
00:09:40,722 --> 00:09:42,089
WILL:
David here is one of my

260
00:09:42,174 --> 00:09:44,374
many Latin friends.

261
00:09:44,426 --> 00:09:46,710
And, uh, he's interested
in starting his own

262
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:48,813
night school Glee Club,
after hours.

263
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,516
<i>So, uh, I invited him to come
watch us get our duende on.</i>

264
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:53,717
<i>Duende?</i>

265
00:09:53,768 --> 00:09:56,153
Ugh, it means "dwarf," you ass.

266
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,988
Now I'm completely confused.
So what's the assignment?

267
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,391
<i>To sing, in Spanish,
with duende.</i>

268
00:10:01,443 --> 00:10:03,393
Which, yes,
literally means "dwarf,"

269
00:10:03,445 --> 00:10:04,895
but metaphorically, it means

270
00:10:04,946 --> 00:10:07,248
to have Spanish soul.

271
00:10:07,332 --> 00:10:10,117
To be filled with
Spanish passion.

272
00:10:10,202 --> 00:10:11,502
Will, can I...

273
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,787
<i>ÿhablar con ellos?
That's... right.</i>

274
00:10:13,872 --> 00:10:17,124
<i>A performance with duende
transforms you.</i>

275
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:21,011
Makes you sing, makes you cry,
makes you laugh.

276
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,796
Makes you want to
kiss a person you love.

277
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:25,516
<i>A song sung in Spanish
must have duende,</i>

278
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,184
or else...

279
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,303
Would you mind showing us?
Oh dear God, please, yes.

280
00:10:30,472 --> 00:10:32,056
Be my guest.

281
00:10:32,107 --> 00:10:34,892
Okay. Well, I'm-I'm not a
professional like you guys,

282
00:10:34,943 --> 00:10:36,610
but I'll give it a go.
All right.

283
00:10:36,695 --> 00:10:38,028
Now, guys, uh...

284
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,397
remember, Mr. Martinez
is here as our guest, okay?

285
00:10:40,448 --> 00:10:42,950
Let's create a safe and
supportive environment.

286
00:10:43,034 --> 00:10:44,601

(cheering and applause)
Yeah!

356
00:13:21,951 --> 00:13:21,951
+

357
00:13:23,995 --> 00:13:26,663
- Here is the problem: Sam and I used to date.
- Then I moved away, and now

358
00:13:26,748 --> 00:13:28,549
I'm bunking at Finn and Kurt's.
And I started dating

359
00:13:28,616 --> 00:13:30,033
another guy who I really like.

360
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,952
But then she and I kissed.

361
00:13:32,003 --> 00:13:33,487
And I feel really weird
about it.

362
00:13:33,555 --> 00:13:34,955
Just trying to
figure out a way

363
00:13:35,006 --> 00:13:36,940
to work this out without
anyone's feelings getting hurt.

364
00:13:37,008 --> 00:13:38,291
Actually, you're in luck

365
00:13:38,343 --> 00:13:40,561
because I just got
my new series of pamphlets

366
00:13:40,628 --> 00:13:42,346
back from the printer,
which uniquely address

367
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,398
the modern-day issues
of today's 21st century teen.

368
00:13:44,465 --> 00:13:46,767
Yes. Okay.

369
00:13:46,818 --> 00:13:48,519
Mm-hmm.

370
00:13:50,488 --> 00:13:51,822
"So You're a Two-Timin' Ho"?

371
00:13:51,906 --> 00:13:53,107
"So You're Dating
a Two-Timin' Ho."

372
00:13:53,174 --> 00:13:54,775
Right? They get
your attention, don't they?

373
00:13:54,826 --> 00:13:57,327
I mean, that... that really
makes you want to read on.

374
00:13:57,412 --> 00:13:58,912
Miss Pillsbury,
I don't sleep around.

375
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,397
That's not me.

376
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,533
Okay.
I'm just trying to
listen to my heart,

377
00:14:02,617 --> 00:14:05,502
and it's like I can't hear
what it's trying to tell me.

378
00:14:05,587 --> 00:14:07,371
Well, if you really want
to listen,

379
00:14:07,455 --> 00:14:09,089
then you need to stop talking.

380
00:14:09,157 --> 00:14:10,824
I'm serious.

381
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,659
You know, there's a lot
of communication

382
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,961
in your lives these days.

383
00:14:14,012 --> 00:14:15,712
With texting and IM'ing
and Facebooking,

384
00:14:15,797 --> 00:14:17,381
I mean, you don't have
any quiet time

385
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:19,433
with yourselves
to make informed decisions

386
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,385
on... on your true feelings.

387
00:14:21,469 --> 00:14:22,519
(cell phone chiming)

388
00:14:22,604 --> 00:14:23,687
For instance.

389
00:14:23,771 --> 00:14:24,888
(chirping)

390
00:14:24,973 --> 00:14:26,673
Sam just tweeted
that I smell good.

391
00:14:26,724 --> 00:14:28,425
I won't stop
till it's trending.

392
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,927
This is my point.

393
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,012
I think that you and Sam
should spend a week

394
00:14:32,063 --> 00:14:33,346
not speaking to each other.

395
00:14:33,398 --> 00:14:35,115
No e-mails, no texts, nothing.

396
00:14:35,183 --> 00:14:36,950
And I think,
at the end of that week,

397
00:14:37,018 --> 00:14:38,452
you'll have
a much better idea of what

398
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,653
your true feelings are.

399
00:14:39,704 --> 00:14:41,021
Shh, shh. No. No.

400
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:43,657
Starting... starting...

401
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,242
now.

402
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,694
Hooray.

403
00:14:47,745 --> 00:14:49,362
Not speaking.

All right, ladies.

Go run and find a swimming hole
to dunk those behinds in

'cause those donkey
booties need to cool off.

418
00:15:31,005 --> 00:15:33,540
Now, I ain't no mind reader,
Sue Sylvester,

419
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:36,960
and I came from
a very superstitious household

420
00:15:37,045 --> 00:15:39,463
where such things
are not allowed,

421
00:15:39,547 --> 00:15:42,382
but I got a feeling
that those Cheerios!

422
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:45,686
like my modern dance moves
a little bit better

423
00:15:45,753 --> 00:15:47,420
than them old stale
white-bread routines

424
00:15:47,472 --> 00:15:48,889
you've been making them do.

425
00:15:48,957 --> 00:15:51,024
You know, Roz,

426
00:15:51,092 --> 00:15:53,927
the English language
lacks the requisite words

427
00:15:53,978 --> 00:15:57,364
to express just how much
I dislike you.

428
00:15:57,431 --> 00:15:58,765
And I'm onto you.

429
00:15:58,816 --> 00:16:00,400
<i>Yeah, I've seen All About Eve.</i>

430
00:16:00,451 --> 00:16:02,169
I know what you're planning.

431
00:16:02,237 --> 00:16:04,655
You're waiting for me to
take maternity leave,

432
00:16:04,739 --> 00:16:07,491
and then you're going to swoop
in and try to steal my job.

433
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:09,543
Hold up. Hold up.
Hold up. Wait.

434
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,961
Oh, my God. Hold up.

435
00:16:11,045 --> 00:16:12,629
Maternity leave?

436
00:16:12,714 --> 00:16:14,281
Are you pulling my leg?

437
00:16:14,332 --> 00:16:15,749
No, I am not.

438
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,136
I am getting pregnant,
and then I am having a baby.

439
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,470
With whose vagina?

440
00:16:20,555 --> 00:16:22,756
Sue, you can't
have no baby.

441
00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:24,474
You are old as a hill.

442
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,793
You ain't gonna
give birth to no child.

443
00:16:26,844 --> 00:16:28,729
You gonna give birth
to a grandchild.

444
00:16:28,796 --> 00:16:30,647
You gonna get in them stirrups,

445
00:16:30,732 --> 00:16:33,267
and you gonna push and push,

446
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:35,068
and a full-grown adult
gonna pop out

447
00:16:35,136 --> 00:16:37,637
with a briefcase and a job
talking on a cell phone.

448
00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:38,905
And by the way,
I don't need

449
00:16:38,973 --> 00:16:42,442
to steal your job,
Sue Sylvester.

450
00:16:42,493 --> 00:16:43,660
You know why?

451
00:16:43,745 --> 00:16:46,113
Principal Figgins
is gonna give it to me.

452
00:16:46,164 --> 00:16:47,698
He wouldn't.

453
00:16:47,782 --> 00:16:50,334
Oh, he would.

454
00:16:50,418 --> 00:16:52,286
You see,
a long time ago,

455
00:16:52,337 --> 00:16:54,154
you won some trophies.

456
00:16:54,205 --> 00:16:56,123
And that was
real impressive.

457
00:16:56,174 --> 00:16:59,126
I, however, am an Olympian.

458
00:16:59,177 --> 00:17:01,895
I won this bronze
damn Olympic medal

459
00:17:01,963 --> 00:17:03,547
in Beijing, China.

460
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:05,098
I had noodles with the president

461
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,833
and a threesome
with Michael Phelps.

462
00:17:06,884 --> 00:17:08,185
What you need to do

463
00:17:08,269 --> 00:17:10,187
is wake up
and smell the menopause.

464
00:17:10,271 --> 00:17:11,805
You are...

465
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:13,440
<i>done... as a coach,</i>

466
00:17:13,507 --> 00:17:15,525
and all the hormones
in Thailand

467
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,811
can't change the fact
that you are done as a woman.

468
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:20,063
What you need to do
is start praying

469
00:17:20,148 --> 00:17:21,748
that you give birth
to a child

470
00:17:21,816 --> 00:17:23,516
that likes to eat sand,

471
00:17:23,568 --> 00:17:26,370
'cause that's all that's coming
out those old, wrinkly boobs.

472
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,875
I can do this.

473
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:34,044
I can do anything.

474
00:17:35,797 --> 00:17:37,547
♪

475
00:17:43,537 --> 00:17:45,872
How is the girl with no ass
supposed to choose

476
00:17:45,923 --> 00:17:49,059
between the juiced-up wolf
and the depressed vampire?

477
00:17:49,143 --> 00:17:50,344
She's into both of them.

478
00:17:50,395 --> 00:17:52,145
Oh, come on, Mercedes.
She just knows.

479
00:17:52,213 --> 00:17:53,980
But what if they both
make her feel amazing

480
00:17:54,048 --> 00:17:55,182
in different ways?

481
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:56,400
Well, you don't
get to choose

482
00:17:56,484 --> 00:17:57,567
when it comes
to true love.

483
00:17:57,652 --> 00:17:58,902
True love chooses you.

484
00:17:58,986 --> 00:18:00,904
And you better be certain
when it comes to marriage

485
00:18:00,988 --> 00:18:01,938
because marriage
is promise,

486
00:18:02,023 --> 00:18:03,190
and it lasts
for forever.

487
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:04,191
Ladies, I appreciate you
spending time

488
00:18:04,242 --> 00:18:05,525

489
00:18:05,576 --> 00:18:07,661
but why are you being
so weird and serious?

00:18:07,728 --> 00:18:09,746
Our periods don't come
until the end of the month.

Shut up!

496
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:28,098
Finn proposed.

497
00:18:28,182 --> 00:18:30,133
And what did you say?
I said yes.

498
00:18:30,218 --> 00:18:31,468
Rachel, have you lost
your damn mind?

499
00:18:31,552 --> 00:18:33,220
But I love Finn.
I really, really love him.

500
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:34,938
But what about NYADA?
It's still going to happen.

501
00:18:35,022 --> 00:18:36,473

502
00:18:36,557 --> 00:18:37,924
for myself, okay,
some of which include,

503
00:18:37,975 --> 00:18:39,359
you know, a little bit
of struggle

504
00:18:39,427 --> 00:18:41,428
until I can make all
of my dreams come true.

505
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:43,697
They'll be great anecdotes
for the Jimmy Kimmel show.

506
00:18:43,764 --> 00:18:45,432
I'll call them
my Top Ramen weeks.

507
00:18:45,483 --> 00:18:47,600
But in every single
one of my dreams--

508
00:18:47,652 --> 00:18:50,370
okay, struggling or not--
there he is.

509

Finn.

510
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:54,157
Look, I know that I
am going to be with Finn

511
00:18:54,242 --> 00:18:56,126
for the rest of my life,
just as much as I know

512
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,794
that I am going to be
a huge star one day.

513
00:18:59,714 --> 00:19:01,415
So you promise
not to tell anyone?

514
00:19:01,466 --> 00:19:03,383
Okay, I'm going home right now
to yell at Finn,

515
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:04,885
because this is insane.

516
00:19:04,952 --> 00:19:06,887
That is not fair, Kurt.
I mean, what would

517
00:19:06,954 --> 00:19:08,305
you do if Blaine proposed
to you today?

518
00:19:11,976 --> 00:19:13,560
So will you please
keep my secret?

519
00:19:13,627 --> 00:19:16,296
Aren't you scared
you're making the wrong choice?

520
00:19:16,347 --> 00:19:20,066
Look, I know that I have
the right person.

521
00:19:20,134 --> 00:19:23,687
Scary part was just...
choosing to know it.

Yeah, what's the deal
with those boots? Because wow.

584
00:23:06,231 --> 00:23:08,833
They're Mexican hipster boots.
It's kind of like a fad

for groups of guys that are into
dance music,

586

Señor Martinez is, like,

590
00:23:18,677 --> 00:23:20,795
the best Spanish teacher ever.

591
00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:22,880

Yeah, to defend
your Spanish teacher honor.

597
00:23:43,202 --> 00:23:44,986
Yes. Will tells me everything.

598
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:49,490
It is so inappropriate for you
to ask him to father your child.

599
00:23:49,575 --> 00:23:52,326
Have a seat,
Lady Bird Hollow Pelvis.

600
00:23:52,411 --> 00:23:54,245
And be careful,
those chairs are hard.

601
00:23:54,296 --> 00:23:55,796
I know how fragile
your bones are.

602
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:58,799
Okay, look, I know how it feels
to want

603
00:23:58,884 --> 00:23:59,834
to start a family.

604
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:01,168
I want to have a baby, too.

605
00:24:01,253 --> 00:24:02,587
I wouldn't get your hopes up.

606
00:24:02,638 --> 00:24:04,288
I doubt your avian frame
could withstand

607
00:24:04,339 --> 00:24:05,456
the rigors of childbirth.

608
00:24:05,507 --> 00:24:07,124
Okay, just tell me, why Will?

609
00:24:07,175 --> 00:24:10,428
You hate him.
You've made that very clear.

610
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:12,263
Well, In case you haven't
noticed, Deena,

611
00:24:12,314 --> 00:24:13,848
I have a little bit
of a mean streak.

612
00:24:13,932 --> 00:24:17,235
I'm cunning, I'm vindictive,
I spend a large portion

613
00:24:17,302 --> 00:24:20,154
of every day vibrating
with a palpable sense

614
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:22,073
of wild, irrational rage.

615
00:24:24,026 --> 00:24:28,246
And I don't ever want my kid
to feel that.

616
00:24:28,313 --> 00:24:31,616
And every time I've
insulted Will

617
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:33,501
or tried to stop him
in his crusade

618
00:24:33,585 --> 00:24:36,287
to ruin pop culture
by wiping his woolly behind

619
00:24:36,338 --> 00:24:38,372
with the American songbook,

620
00:24:38,457 --> 00:24:44,328
he's always risen up
and met me with kindness.

621
00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:48,099
If goodness
and optimism are
somehow genetic,

622
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:51,102
that's what I want
for my child.

623
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:59,610
He isn't gonna do it, is he?

624
00:24:59,678 --> 00:25:01,329
I prefer to let him
tell you that.

625
00:25:01,396 --> 00:25:05,483
I'm really sorry, Sue.

626
00:25:05,534 --> 00:25:07,568
You know, for what it's worth,

627
00:25:07,653 --> 00:25:10,371
I... I think you should have
a child.

628
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:14,542
I think it'd be
really good for you.

629
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,214
(bell ringing)

630
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:30,374
Hey, dude.
You want to lift some?

631
00:25:30,425 --> 00:25:32,059
No, thanks.

632
00:25:32,144 --> 00:25:33,844
I've never really understood
the whole process.

633
00:25:33,895 --> 00:25:36,347
Plus, I do The Tracey Anderson
Method

634
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:38,599
in the comfort and privacy
of my own bedroom.

635
00:25:38,684 --> 00:25:39,717
Hmm.

636
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,389
Why don't you pick up these?

637
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,241
They're from
Mrs. Pillsbury.

638
00:25:47,326 --> 00:25:48,576
College brochures.
What do you got?

639
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,894
Fordham, NYU, Adelphi.

640
00:25:50,946 --> 00:25:52,330
That one's in Long Island.

641
00:25:52,397 --> 00:25:54,165
Yeah, there's a train
station right next to the campus

642
00:25:54,232 --> 00:25:55,232
right into Manhattan.

643
00:25:55,283 --> 00:25:57,752
I think they have
a football team.

644
00:25:57,836 --> 00:25:59,870
I think they all have musical
theater programs, too.

645
00:25:59,921 --> 00:26:01,205
That's sweet, dude,
but you know,

646
00:26:01,256 --> 00:26:02,289
college isn't for everyone.

647
00:26:02,374 --> 00:26:03,457
Neither is marriage.

648
00:26:04,976 --> 00:26:06,794
I can't believe she told you.

649
00:26:06,878 --> 00:26:09,463
I can't believe you didn't.
We're supposed to be brothers.

650
00:26:09,531 --> 00:26:11,015
Look, I didn't want
to put you in

651
00:26:11,082 --> 00:26:12,083
an awkward position
with Burt, okay?

652
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,467
I don't want him to know yet.

653
00:26:13,552 --> 00:26:14,635
Hey, you think something

654
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,253
you have to keep
from everyone you love

655
00:26:16,304 --> 00:26:18,356
might not be the best idea in
the first place?

656
00:26:18,423 --> 00:26:20,274
Don't get down on me
about this, dude.

657
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:22,193
Rachel's, like, the only good
thing I've got going

658
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,361
in my life right now.

659
00:26:23,428 --> 00:26:25,229
No, she isn't, Finn.

660
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,815
Look, I get you've had a rough
year with finding out

661
00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:30,117
who your dad really is and-and
losing the scholarship,

662
00:26:30,202 --> 00:26:33,821
but you're a star, Finn,
just as bright as Rachel.

663
00:26:33,905 --> 00:26:35,439
You just don't
believe in yourself.

664
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,158
Yeah, well, the proof's in
the pudding, okay?

665
00:26:37,242 --> 00:26:39,577
And my pudding
pretty much sucks.

666
00:26:39,628 --> 00:26:42,413
Look, I'm not telling you that
you shouldn't marry Rachel.

667
00:26:42,464 --> 00:26:44,165
I love her despite
all of her crazy,

668
00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:47,301
and I think that you'd be
lucky to marry her... one day.

669
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:49,136
But I don't want you just to
turn yourself into nothing

670
00:26:49,221 --> 00:26:51,088
but the guy who holds her purse
on the red carpet.

671
00:26:51,139 --> 00:26:52,506
Look, I'm getting to the
point in my life where

672
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:54,592
I kind of need to be honest with
myself about who I am.

673
00:26:54,643 --> 00:26:55,943
And who is that?

674
00:26:56,011 --> 00:26:57,962
Not you.

675
00:26:58,029 --> 00:27:00,564
Not Rachel.

676
00:27:00,632 --> 00:27:02,850
That's the point, Finn.

677
00:27:02,934 --> 00:27:05,569
There are plenty
of us, trust me.

678
00:27:05,637 --> 00:27:09,240
The one thing that Glee Clubs
and theater programs don't have

679
00:27:09,307 --> 00:27:12,142
is the hot, straight football
player who can sing

680
00:27:12,194 --> 00:27:15,145
and sort of dance.
You're unique, Finn.

681
00:27:15,197 --> 00:27:18,148
And I can't see this proposal
thing as anything else

682
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,150
but you giving up
on yourself.

683
00:27:20,202 --> 00:27:22,620
No, no, it's not.

684
00:27:25,207 --> 00:27:27,157
At least I don't...
I don't think it is.

685
00:27:27,209 --> 00:27:30,928
Your time isn't up, Finn.

686
00:27:30,996 --> 00:27:32,663
It's just beginning.

687
00:27:36,501 --> 00:27:38,001
Hey, Kurt.

688
00:27:40,338 --> 00:27:42,523
Thanks.

689
00:27:45,076 --> 00:27:47,478

691
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,586
Hold it right there,
Sandbacks.

692
00:27:55,756 --> 00:27:57,706
You and I need to
have a serious chat.

693
00:27:57,758 --> 00:27:59,541
Now I realize
when I chose Becky

694
00:27:59,593 --> 00:28:00,760
as co-captain for
the Cheerios!

695
00:28:00,844 --> 00:28:02,377
it might have rubbed
you the wrong way.

696
00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:03,712
Wanky.

697
00:28:03,764 --> 00:28:05,481
And I've often admired
the craven heartlessness

698
00:28:05,548 --> 00:28:08,067
of your pointless,
vindictive back-stabbing.

699
00:28:08,151 --> 00:28:10,236
Kind of takes me back
to the old salad days.

700
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,354
But you crossed the Maginot Line

701
00:28:12,405 --> 00:28:14,323
when you started messing with
Sue Sylvester's family.

702
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,408
What are you talking about?
What family?

703
00:28:16,493 --> 00:28:18,694
You lodged a complaint
about my teaching tactics

704
00:28:18,745 --> 00:28:20,830
with Principal Figgins,
possibly derailing my bid

705
00:28:20,897 --> 00:28:23,783
for tenure just when I'm trying
to have a baby!

706
00:28:23,867 --> 00:28:26,702
A baby? With whose vagina?

707
00:28:26,753 --> 00:28:28,403
Hey, what is going on here?

708
00:28:28,455 --> 00:28:30,873
Coach Sylvester is accusing me
of something I didn't do.

709
00:28:30,924 --> 00:28:33,292
Oh, stop with the lies, sweater
meat, or you will be hawking

710
00:28:33,376 --> 00:28:35,127
nude glossies of yourself behind
the Dumpster of Hooters

711
00:28:35,212 --> 00:28:36,462
by the weekend.

712
00:28:36,546 --> 00:28:37,596
I know you did this!

713
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:39,414
Sue, enough!

714
00:28:39,466 --> 00:28:42,935
No one messes with my family.
No one.

715
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:45,137
Oh, and you can rest your fetid,
woolly head, William.

716
00:28:45,222 --> 00:28:47,022
I don't need
your baby spunk anymore.

717
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:49,892
Got myself another donor.
And a much better one.

718
00:28:49,943 --> 00:28:51,393
Who?

719
00:28:58,935 --> 00:29:01,654
(bell ringing)

720
00:29:01,738 --> 00:29:03,706
(foops approach)

721
00:29:05,441 --> 00:29:07,743
I just got my new pamphlets
back from the printer.

722
00:29:07,794 --> 00:29:11,446
I am feeling so
Stephen King with
these things lately.

723
00:29:11,498 --> 00:29:13,465
You know, just
so prolific.

724
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,134
That's great, Em,
but I really need

725
00:29:15,218 --> 00:29:17,119
to translate this song
for my big number tomorrow.

726
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,505
It's my last chance to wow
the kids with my español.

727
00:29:19,589 --> 00:29:21,223
By the end of
the week, I need

728
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:22,842
every single one of those kids
begging Figgins

729
00:29:22,926 --> 00:29:25,127
to give me that tenure spot.

730
00:29:25,178 --> 00:29:27,346
<i>Conversación.
Of course.</i>

731
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,849
<i>"Conversation" in Spanish is
conversación.</i>

732
00:29:29,933 --> 00:29:31,650
(sighs)

733
00:29:35,856 --> 00:29:37,940
Do you realize how important
this tenure is for us,

734
00:29:37,991 --> 00:29:39,275
if we want to start a family?

735
00:29:39,326 --> 00:29:41,277
It means we will
always be able to feed our kids,

736
00:29:41,328 --> 00:29:43,495
get them health insurance.

737
00:29:46,199 --> 00:29:47,783
Emma, enough!

738
00:29:47,834 --> 00:29:51,153
Can't you see I'm doing
this to take care of you?

739
00:29:52,822 --> 00:29:56,008
Okay, I think I can
take care of myself.

740
00:29:56,092 --> 00:29:58,260
You know what, I'm sorry.

741
00:29:58,328 --> 00:30:00,045
I just wanted to show
you my new pamphlets.

742
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,463
I'm really proud of them.

743
00:30:01,514 --> 00:30:04,600
They're silly, Emma.
I'm sorry, I love you,

744
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:06,685
but do you really think
the kids take them seriously?

745
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:09,805
Okay, you know what?
I know that the titles are
silly; that's the point.

746
00:30:09,856 --> 00:30:12,174
Sometimes you have to
be a little provocative

747
00:30:12,225 --> 00:30:14,193
if you want to get
teenagers' attention.

748
00:30:14,277 --> 00:30:16,028
<i>They're
conversación starters.</i>

749
00:30:16,112 --> 00:30:17,813
And you're being really mean.

750
00:30:17,864 --> 00:30:18,847
You got a pamphlet for that?

751
00:30:20,734 --> 00:30:22,568
Emma, I'm sorry.

752
00:30:22,652 --> 00:30:23,903
Emma, wait.

753
00:30:28,658 --> 00:30:30,859

They all loved my performance.

to a bullfighting mariachi.

874
00:35:36,402 --> 00:35:37,485
Why don't you just

875
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:40,104
dress up as
the Taco Bell Chihuahua

876
00:35:40,155 --> 00:35:42,206
<i>and bark the theme song
to Dora the Explorer?</i>

877
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:44,442
You don't even know enough
to be embarrassed

878
00:35:44,493 --> 00:35:46,911
about these stereotypes
that you're perpetuating.

879
00:35:46,962 --> 00:35:48,379
That's not fair.
Isn't it?

880
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:51,382
What did you want to be
when you grew up?

881
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,668
Why did you become
a Spanish teacher, Mr. Shue?

882
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:57,788
Because...

883
00:36:02,728 --> 00:36:06,481
...it was the only teaching
position open at the time.

884
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,686
I want to remind you
of something that

885
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,005
an amazing teacher
once taught me:

886
00:36:14,073 --> 00:36:16,691
without passion,
you can't succeed.

887
00:36:18,694 --> 00:36:19,994
Who taught you that?

888
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,046
You did.

889
00:36:22,114 --> 00:36:23,514
And you do.

890
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:24,732
When you teach Glee.

891
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:31,873
I'm telling you,
there's no word but "genius."

892
00:36:31,957 --> 00:36:33,658
I wouldn't
call it that.

893
00:36:33,709 --> 00:36:35,293
What's genius?
My plan for Regionals?

894
00:36:35,344 --> 00:36:38,129
No. Your lil'
punkin's pamphlets.

895
00:36:39,498 --> 00:36:40,632
"Taint Misbehavin'."

896
00:36:40,683 --> 00:36:41,633
Mm-hmm.

897
00:36:41,684 --> 00:36:42,934
It's all about the importance

898
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:44,552
of thoroughly washing
your jockstrap.

899
00:36:44,637 --> 00:36:46,070
(chuckles)
Hey, bub,

900
00:36:46,138 --> 00:36:48,272
MRSA bacteria infection
is no laughing matter.

901
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,474
No matter how
much I talked

902
00:36:49,525 --> 00:36:52,626
to my guys about
the steamy lurking dangers,

903
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:53,811
nobody cared

904
00:36:53,862 --> 00:36:55,846
Until Emma found a way
to get through to them.

905
00:36:55,898 --> 00:36:57,848
Come on, guys!

906
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,018
Why, just last week,
three Fort Wayne gymnasts

907
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:03,454
had to have
their junk amputated!

908
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:06,074
I stopped washing down there
'cause it seemed kind of gay.

909
00:37:06,158 --> 00:37:08,826
I thought that's what the hair
was for: catching the dirt.

910
00:37:08,877 --> 00:37:10,578
Huh. Lift and scrub.

911
00:37:10,663 --> 00:37:12,213
Who knew it was so easy?

912
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:14,215
BEISTE:
And now their kibbles
and bits are

913
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:15,883
as clean as a little
angel's tear.

914
00:37:15,968 --> 00:37:17,969
And when I showed that
to my Cooter,

915
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:21,872
not only did he order
10,000 copies for Ohio State,

916
00:37:21,924 --> 00:37:25,259
he got every team in the Big Ten
to order copies, too.

917
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:27,478
Wow, that's...
It's genius!

918
00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:29,847
I have never met a
teacher whose passion

919
00:37:29,898 --> 00:37:31,683
literally saves lives.

920
00:37:31,734 --> 00:37:33,101
Aren't you proud of her, Will?

921
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:36,187
Yes.

922
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:37,071
Absolutely.

923
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:40,358
Genius! You!

924
00:37:40,409 --> 00:37:41,275
EMMA:
Stop.

925
00:37:42,252 --> 00:37:42,252
+

926
00:37:45,047 --> 00:37:47,232
And the award for
Best Conjugator goes to

927
00:37:47,317 --> 00:37:48,434
Señora Stephanie.

928
00:37:48,518 --> 00:37:49,601
(laughs)

929
00:37:50,887 --> 00:37:53,572
Thank you,
Señor Martinez.

930
00:37:53,656 --> 00:37:55,774
And thanks to you,
Claudia knows now

931
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:57,993
to go before she
comes to work.

932
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,561
(laughs)

933
00:37:59,612 --> 00:38:02,063
Now finally, Most Improved:

934
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:04,583
Will Schuester.

935
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:06,084
Wow.
Come on, man!

936
00:38:06,169 --> 00:38:07,753
(chuckles)
Thanks.

937
00:38:07,837 --> 00:38:09,288
Wow, I...

938
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:10,622
(school bell ringing)
Oh.

939
00:38:10,707 --> 00:38:11,740
<i>Fue un año
maravilloso.</i>

940
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:13,208
It was a beautiful
year, everyone.

941
00:38:13,259 --> 00:38:14,593
<i>Gracias.
Hey, de nada.</i>

942
00:38:14,677 --> 00:38:16,595
<i>Gracias.
(chuckles)</i>

943
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:18,914
Your teeth are like
fresh-driven snow white.

944
00:38:18,965 --> 00:38:20,516
Like Larry Bird white.

945
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:22,468
(Will and David laugh)

946
00:38:22,552 --> 00:38:24,186
Most Improved.

947
00:38:24,253 --> 00:38:27,055
I don't think that's the award
a Spanish teacher wants to get

948
00:38:27,106 --> 00:38:28,524
in Spanish class.

949
00:38:28,591 --> 00:38:31,560
Will, man, you work hard,
you take care of your kids.

950
00:38:31,611 --> 00:38:33,094
They're very lucky
to have you, man.

951
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:34,980
They deserve better.

952
00:38:35,064 --> 00:38:36,264
They deserve you.

953
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:38,667
Oh, so when do I
start? (laughs)

954
00:38:38,735 --> 00:38:40,602
How about Monday?

955
00:38:40,653 --> 00:38:42,037
I spoke to Figgins.

956
00:38:42,104 --> 00:38:44,373
I had all the kids go in
and talk to him, as well.

957
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,109
They all want to take Spanish
if you're the teacher.

958
00:38:47,177 --> 00:38:49,011
What, he's offering me a job?

959
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,347
Teaching?

960
00:38:52,415 --> 00:38:53,749
During the day?

961
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,300
(chuckles):
I hope you're not a vampire.

962
00:38:56,886 --> 00:38:58,453
Oh, man.

963
00:38:58,505 --> 00:38:59,388
(laughs)

964
00:38:59,455 --> 00:39:01,390
Okay.

965
00:39:01,457 --> 00:39:03,926
Oh, man, you don...
you don't understand.

966
00:39:03,977 --> 00:39:05,594
My-My parents,

967
00:39:05,645 --> 00:39:07,479
my parents were immigrants.

968
00:39:07,564 --> 00:39:10,315
And they had to lie
about their citizenship

969
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,300
to go to high school.

970
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:14,603
And now I'm teaching it.

971
00:39:14,654 --> 00:39:16,321
It's the American Dream, right?

972
00:39:16,406 --> 00:39:17,689
Yeah.
(chuckles)

973
00:39:17,774 --> 00:39:19,491
But what about you?

974
00:39:19,576 --> 00:39:22,811
Oh, there's-there's an opening
in the History department.

975
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:24,329
I've always loved history.

976
00:39:24,397 --> 00:39:26,331
Well, the History Channel,
at least.

977
00:39:26,416 --> 00:39:28,650
<i>Right.
Maybe I'll find
my duende there.</i>

978
00:39:28,701 --> 00:39:31,537
No, I've seen you, I've seen you
teach Glee Club, man.

979
00:39:31,621 --> 00:39:33,705
<i>u have duende
coming out of your orejas.</i>

980
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:36,491
Ears.
Ears, right.

981
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:37,759
I got you.
(laughs)

982
00:39:37,827 --> 00:39:38,927
Thank you so much.

983
00:39:38,995 --> 00:39:41,430
Thank you.

984
00:39:41,497 --> 00:39:44,383
So, wait a minute, who ended up
getting the tenure position?

985
00:39:48,738 --> 00:39:50,772
Thank you, Becky.

986
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,026
My online pharmacist
has recommended these

987
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:56,511
fertility injections every day,
twice a day,

988
00:39:56,563 --> 00:39:59,364
until Little Susie
or Little Sylvester catches.

989
00:39:59,449 --> 00:40:00,449
You down with that?

990
00:40:00,516 --> 00:40:01,817
No problem, Coach.

991
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,320
What's wrong?

992
00:40:05,371 --> 00:40:07,506
Coach, I have
a confession to make.

993
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:09,190
Take a seat.

994
00:40:09,242 --> 00:40:10,692
Now, if this is about

995
00:40:10,743 --> 00:40:14,029
the complaint you lodged against
me with Principal Figgins,

996
00:40:14,097 --> 00:40:15,363
I already know.

997
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:16,498
You do, Coach?

998
00:40:16,549 --> 00:40:17,749
Oh, Becky, I've known

999
00:40:17,817 --> 00:40:19,351
ever since
I tinker-tailor-soldier-spied

1000
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:21,470
my way into Figgins's
file cabinet and read

1001
00:40:21,537 --> 00:40:22,504
the evaluation cards.

1002
00:40:22,555 --> 00:40:23,722
And when I saw one

1003
00:40:23,806 --> 00:40:25,207
written in crayon,
I knew it was either

1004
00:40:25,275 --> 00:40:27,476
you or Brittany,
and you're the better speller.

1005
00:40:27,543 --> 00:40:28,594
Coach, I'm sorry.

1006
00:40:28,678 --> 00:40:30,145
I was just looking out
for the team.

1007
00:40:30,212 --> 00:40:33,749
Did you mean what you wrote?

1008
00:40:33,816 --> 00:40:36,218
That you're worried I'm not
as focused on the Cheerios!

1009
00:40:36,286 --> 00:40:37,886
as I used to be?

1010
00:40:37,937 --> 00:40:39,438
Well, then you don't
need be sorry.

1011
00:40:39,522 --> 00:40:41,773
And thank you for the feedback.

1012
00:40:41,858 --> 00:40:43,224
You're not mad?

1013
00:40:43,276 --> 00:40:44,693
No, Becky.

1014
00:40:44,744 --> 00:40:46,111
(sighs)

1015
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:49,915
But impending motherhood
doth given me perspective.

1016
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:53,735
Oh, Becky, I'm reminded
of all my passions: winning,

1017
00:40:53,786 --> 00:40:55,003
my girls,

1018
00:40:55,071 --> 00:40:56,872
destroying my enemies.

1019
00:40:56,923 --> 00:40:58,540
Motherhood's not gonna
change that.

1020
00:40:58,591 --> 00:41:01,343
If anything, it makes me
want them far more.

1021
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:03,962
You're an excellent
co-captain, Becky.

1022
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:05,847
You're like me.

1023
00:41:05,915 --> 00:41:07,582
Not afraid to make
the tough calls.

1024
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:08,900
Coach?

1025
00:41:08,968 --> 00:41:10,218
You're gonna be a great mom.

1026
00:41:22,264 --> 00:41:24,950
(school bell ringing)

1027
00:41:37,947 --> 00:41:39,948
There you are, baby.
You ready?

1028
00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:41,967
For lunch.

1029
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:43,301
We're going
off-campus, right?

1030
00:41:43,386 --> 00:41:44,836
Hey, Sam.

1031
00:41:57,567 --> 00:41:59,901
(school bell ringing faintly)

1032
00:42:05,191 --> 00:42:06,525
What's all this?

1033
00:42:11,781 --> 00:42:15,617
"So You Were A Jerk
To Your Fiance."

1034
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:20,672
Not particularly clever,
but I appreciate your pith.

1035
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:25,794
(laughs):
"Congratulations--
I Love You."

1036
00:42:25,845 --> 00:42:27,262
These are wonderful.

1037
00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:28,663
They're wonderful.

1038
00:42:28,715 --> 00:42:30,098
(both chuckle)

1039
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:33,168
A little myopic maybe,
but a great first effort.

1040
00:42:37,056 --> 00:42:38,607
I'm so proud of you.

1041
00:42:38,674 --> 00:42:41,560
So do I call you Professor
or Madam or what?

1042
00:42:41,644 --> 00:42:43,311
I'm not sure of
the protocol here.

1043
00:42:43,362 --> 00:42:44,563
No, no, no,
it's just tenure.

1044
00:42:44,647 --> 00:42:45,847
You can call me Emma.

1045
00:42:45,898 --> 00:42:48,349
Or sweetheart
or cutie pie or doll-face.

1046
00:42:48,401 --> 00:42:49,451
Or Professor Doll-Face.
Ooh.

1047
00:42:49,518 --> 00:42:50,535
I like Professor Doll-Face.

1048
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,704
(laughs)

1049
00:42:52,789 --> 00:42:54,122
(clears throat)

00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:56,191
My first marriage didn't
work out because my wife

1051
00:42:56,242 --> 00:42:57,459
didn't believe in me.

1052
00:42:57,526 --> 00:43:01,413
And then I go and pull
the same crap on you.

1053
00:43:01,497 --> 00:43:05,333
All I know is that right now,
in this moment,

1054
00:43:05,384 --> 00:43:08,920
I just want it to stop.

1055
00:43:09,005 --> 00:43:13,225
I want to sit here, eat
some chicken and look back on

1056
00:43:13,309 --> 00:43:15,343
everything you've done
to get to this moment

1057
00:43:15,394 --> 00:43:19,314
and everything I'm going to do
from this moment on

1058
00:43:19,381 --> 00:43:23,885
to make sure you feel...
as special... and amazing

1059
00:43:23,936 --> 00:43:26,655
as I know you are.
