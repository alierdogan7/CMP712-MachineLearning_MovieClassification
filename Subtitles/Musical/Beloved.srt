Want to try another size?
-Yes.

12
00:01:00,138 --> 00:01:02,530
Here's the left foot,
would you like to try it.

13
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,000
We also have a 36.

<i>You keep lying, when you oughta be truthin'</i>

25

<i> and now
I'm going to walk </i>

31
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,470
I'm closing, Madeleine.

32
00:02:45,328 --> 00:02:47,148
Yes!

33
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,960
Goodbye.

34
00:03:03,173 --> 00:03:05,323
Do you have a bad back,
Madeleine?

35
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,005
50 francs, okay for you?

36
00:04:17,653 --> 00:04:19,473
No.

37
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,120
That's 50 000 in old Francs.

38
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,259
70 000?

39
00:04:43,205 --> 00:04:45,450
Where shall we go?
Are you staying at a hotel?

40
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:48,520
No, I live over there.

41
00:04:52,304 --> 00:04:54,520
If Roger Vivier had not
designed shoes

42
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,370
for Christian Dior, my mother
would never have been a whore

43
00:04:58,028 --> 00:04:59,988
I like the word whore.

44
00:05:00,103 --> 00:05:02,330
It adds to the story of
my parents.

45
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,079
The mother never said that word.
She says it was just something she did occasionally.

46
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,820
She was always
in formal employment.

47
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,000
That prostitution was
extra money.

48
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,520
Good morning, Madeleine.
Good morning, Mrs. Menant.

49
00:05:13,572 --> 00:05:15,532
Mme. Menant.

50
00:05:19,501 --> 00:05:21,320
That night as they
went up the stairs

51
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,100
My mother figured her
potential turnover.

52
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,310
Counted all the shoes
and dresses that she'd be able to buy.

53
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,769
Even today she's not
afraid to say ...

54
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:34,320
without Roger Vivier, she would
most certainly have become a thief.

55
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,780
I think she's in a way
convinced that

56
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,000
prostitution saved her from prison.

57
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,120
Are you Madeleine?

58
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,730
Yes.

59
00:06:45,778 --> 00:06:48,620
A friend gave me your address.
You can ...

60
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,720
do you ... make love ... with you?

61
00:06:53,022 --> 00:06:55,122
It's possible if you have money.

62
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,127
Well .. I've got this.

63
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,893
Come with me.

64
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:30,120
Are you okay?

65
00:07:30,206 --> 00:07:32,320
It's just a little tickle.

66
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,270
Tickle?

67
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,521
In my throat ...

68
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,170
Cough ...

69
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:57,769
-Not here. Are you crazy?
-No. I am a doctor.

70
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,920
Cough-again, please.
-No, no ...

71
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:02,408
I don't do weird things,
please go

72
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:05,809
I don't want to do weird things.
I'm really a doctor.

73
00:08:09,173 --> 00:08:11,003
Cough.

74
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:15,685
Again.

75
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,476
Come.

76
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,220
So, this is Marie Dominique.

77
00:08:37,407 --> 00:08:39,257
-Nice to meet you!
-Good morning.

78
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,800
And hidden behind her officer
is Odette.

79
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:44,800
-Nice to meet you.
Shall I introduce myself?

80
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,751
François Gouriot.

81
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:51,680
François.
Danielle, you already know.

82
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,417
Yes.
You look very elegant today, Danielle.

83
00:08:54,462 --> 00:08:57,170
Thank you.
-And my boss, Ms. Rivier.

84
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,220
-Good morning.
-My compliments.

85
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,080
And this is the Jaromil.
He comes from Czechoslovakia.

86
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,327
But he's not a communist,
he's a doctor.

87
00:09:05,534 --> 00:09:08,970
An Endocrinologist. Anything
that has to do with glands.

88
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:11,290
It is a specialty
taught in our country,

89
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,420
it's why he came
improve himself here.

90
00:09:15,706 --> 00:09:18,086
-Well then, until tomorrow.
-See you soon.

91
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,944
Goodbye, Madeleine.

92
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:22,106
-Goodbye, My Lady.
-Up.

93
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,011
I think you made
quite an impression.

94
00:09:27,323 --> 00:09:29,490
Good. Repeat after me:

95
00:09:29,928 --> 00:09:32,710
- "Lékar."
- "Lékar."

96
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,370
What do you mean?

97
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,450
I mean doctor in Czech.

98
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,870
Good. It means
"The best doctor in Prague."

99
00:09:58,006 --> 00:10:00,070
Good.
You're ready, my dear.

100
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,409
What did I say?

101
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,850
"I am the wife of
best doctor in Prague. "

102
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,430
My God.

103
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,320
It was beautiful.
But Jaromil, you're crazy.

104
00:10:13,604 --> 00:10:15,604
No, I'm in love.

105
00:10:15,673 --> 00:10:17,620
I'm also in love, but ...

106
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,910
I must be honest, Jaromil.

107
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,308
I will never go to
Czechoslovakia with you.

108
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,270
So you don't love me.

109
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,070
How can you say that,
I adore you.

110
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,870
We don't let go of
the people we love.

111
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,816
I never said I would.

112
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,967
-Do you want to make me cry, is that it?
-Madeleine ...

113
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,210
I got to go back. I don't have
the right to stay in France.

114
00:10:37,621 --> 00:10:40,740
But you told me that you
could get a visa to stay.

115
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,820
Yes, but I don't want to
spend my life here.

116
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,023
I don't want become your pimp.

117
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,730
In France don't they call
the husband of a whore a pimp?

118
00:10:53,316 --> 00:10:55,036
Go, go.

119
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,608
<i> Wait until we hate each other </i>

120
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,563
<i> until we come to blows </i>

121
00:11:10,402 --> 00:11:13,680
<i> Before going to the East </i>

Watch out,
theyre still hot

154
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,120
You see,

155
00:14:56,144 --> 00:14:58,462
theyre not
completely cooked.

156
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:01,955
Dont get under our feet
whilst were cooking.

157
00:15:02,115 --> 00:15:04,088
Go see your uncle.

158
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,180
Where's Daddy?

159
00:15:08,526 --> 00:15:12,719
Hes gone hunting.

160
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,960
to feed his family.

161
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,830
No, no.

162
00:15:22,445 --> 00:15:24,520
Don't mess it up.

163
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,670
That's three times this week
he hasnt come back...

164
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,810
I know, my dear.

165
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,310
Men sometimes
have this crazyness.

166
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,240
And then it passes.

167
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,577
But where is he?
What is he doing?

168
00:15:48,671 --> 00:15:51,369
He must have been
on duty at the hospital.

169
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:56,585
Three shifts in the same week?

170
00:15:56,824 --> 00:15:59,120
I'll make some tea.

171
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:12,209
- Where you going?
- To look for him.

172
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,947
We must stay calm.

173
00:16:51,008 --> 00:16:55,380
It is the only thing we can do
under the circumstances.

174
00:16:55,450 --> 00:17:00,280
-Madeleine, what are you doing here?
-Karel, I was so scared.

175
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,482
There are tanks everywhere
it's war ...

176
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,420
Not war, it's the Russians.

177
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,420
Come on, I'll take you home.

178
00:17:08,535 --> 00:17:10,607
No, have to find Jaromil.

179
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:14,430
He left ages ago.

180
00:17:16,526 --> 00:17:18,804
He never came home.

181
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,852
Get in.

182
00:17:33,226 --> 00:17:37,377
You should go to the French Embassy,
Madeleine.

183
00:17:38,731 --> 00:17:42,088
You're French, you can
leave the country with Jaromil.

184
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:50,420
Do you know where he is?

185
00:17:51,474 --> 00:17:53,550
Take me there!

186
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,280
I want us to go back to Paris.

187
00:17:57,433 --> 00:18:00,347
I don't care who he's with.

188
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,670
-Madeleine.
-Karel.

189
00:18:05,408 --> 00:18:07,420
I can't.

190
00:18:08,109 --> 00:18:10,034
This is between the two of you.

191
00:18:10,605 --> 00:18:15,112
He'll be back in the morning.
You can travel during the day.

192
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,430
It's on the ground floor.

193
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:40,323
I can't wait for you.
You understand?

194
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,080
Jaromil!

195
00:18:56,465 --> 00:18:58,325
Jaromil!

196
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,470
I know you're there.

197
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,600
I'm not angry, but we must go.
We must go immediately.

198
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,670
The Russians have invaded Prague.

199
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,420
-There are tanks in the city.
-She's crazy... always making things up.

200
00:19:20,024 --> 00:19:21,994
Are you sure?

201
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:25,772
Yes, it's a joke!

202
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,151
She's amazing!

203
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,120
<i> If you never hear me </i>

204
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,860
<i>If you never see me </i>

205
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,510
<i> Shame on you </i>

206
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,503
<i> If by any chance you hear me </i>

207
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,420
<i> If by any chance you believe me </i>

208
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,900
<i> I swear, the cost may be high,
but this time I'm going </i>

209
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:09,120
<i> Oh, Prague!
What made me do it</i>

210
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:14,764
<i> Remember the ring
you put on my finger? </i>

211
00:20:19,016 --> 00:20:21,320
<i> Oh, Prague </i>

212
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:24,950
<i> This ring means nothing to me anymore </i>

213
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,350
<i>Your sun fades
with a final glow </i>

214
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,129
Talk to her. Explain.

215
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,830
Now that she already knows.
-She knows nothing.

216
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,320
She's already gone.

217
00:20:42,206 --> 00:20:45,658
And you can open your legs,

218
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,670
let's finish what we started.

219
00:20:49,204 --> 00:20:51,020
<i> If you never hear me </i>

220
00:20:52,829 --> 00:20:55,170
<i> If you never see me </i>

221
00:20:56,823 --> 00:21:00,723
<i>The bells would
immediately play for me </i>

222
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,750
<i> If by any chance you listen to me </i>

223
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,450
<i> If by any chance you believe me </i>

224
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,920
<i>They will play my defeat </i>

225
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,120
<i> I'm leaving, he's all yours. </i>

226
00:21:20,104 --> 00:21:22,260
<i> Oh, Prague </i>

227
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,523
<i> What made me do it</i>

228
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,120
<i> Remember the ring
you put on my finger? </i>

229
00:21:35,404 --> 00:21:37,540
<i> Oh, Prague </i>

230
00:21:38,643 --> 00:21:41,000
<i> this ring is mine no longer </i>

231
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:46,520
<i>Your  sun fades
with a final glow </i>

232
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,470
<b> SINGLE QUARTERS</ b></b>

233
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,380
<b> MARRIED QUARTERS </ b></b>

234
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,720
Honey, I could have someone
come and fix the bathroom light?

235
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,990
I'll fix it
at the weekend.

236
00:22:18,029 --> 00:22:20,080
-Ready.
Thank you.

237
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,022
Mind my lipstick.

238
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:26,209
And the postman,
will the postman come?

239
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:28,149
We're entitled to a postman
like everyone else.

240
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:30,020
Yes.

241
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,810
Good morning, my princesses.
-Vera, it's ten to eight.

242
00:22:35,811 --> 00:22:37,999
I'm not taking you by car,
I did warn you.

243
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,050
Yes I'm ready.
I need 15 francs.

244
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,347
-For what?
I need 15 francs, that's all.

245
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:45,570
You irritate me. I don't like
to give money that way.

246
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,380
Go.

247
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,908
Hello!

248
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:54,870
Mother dear ...

249
00:22:55,043 --> 00:22:57,420
Go. Take your scarf.

250
00:22:59,007 --> 00:23:01,500
I'm staying at Hotel Camellia.

251
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,200
4 D'Arcey Street

252
00:23:06,007 --> 00:23:08,130
Room 17.

253
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,740
Are you coming now?

254
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,587
Alright.

255
00:23:59,088 --> 00:24:01,150
You're super late.

256
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,730
You should not have come.

257
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,820
I leave by plane tomorrow.

258
00:24:06,136 --> 00:24:08,196
It is a medical congress.

259
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:10,710
And they let you out?

260
00:24:11,506 --> 00:24:13,700
Don't blame the Communists.

261
00:24:14,402 --> 00:24:16,720
I knew
you would turn communist.

262
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,920
I don't know a thing about politics,
but it is very beautiful.

263
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,970
Please.

264
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:25,024
Really.
Your second marriage is good.

265
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:29,150
You can notice. Long live France!

266
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:32,025
You wouldn't understand, Jaromil.

267
00:24:37,006 --> 00:24:40,060
-I miss you.
-I warn you, nothing will happen.

268
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,170
I always think of you.

269
00:24:44,681 --> 00:24:46,570
And what do you think?

270
00:24:46,636 --> 00:24:48,666
I dream I'm
making love with you.

271
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,030
Yes? And it's good?

272
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,840
It's hard to say.

273
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:58,524
Very well.

274
00:24:58,525 --> 00:25:01,430
Invite me to go to your room
but promise to behave.

275
00:25:11,739 --> 00:25:13,570
-You are beautiful.
-No.

276
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,920
Men no longer
turn to watch me.

277
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:18,320
-They pass me by.
-Is it serious?

278
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,680
Before I was a mother they whistled.
Yes, it's serious.

279
00:25:22,005 --> 00:25:23,540
Is life passing me
backwards.

280
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:26,170
-You being childish.
-Do you see this wrinkle?

281
00:25:26,334 --> 00:25:28,774
What wrinkle?
-It wasn't there last week.

282
00:25:28,808 --> 00:25:30,408
No?

283
00:25:30,634 --> 00:25:33,730
I was sure you'd would do that.
Why did you call?

284
00:25:36,232 --> 00:25:38,282
Either way,
I don't care.

285
00:25:47,851 --> 00:25:49,821
-No.
-Yes.

286
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,729
-No.
-Yes.

287
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,250
Yes.

288
00:25:57,604 --> 00:25:59,574
Wait ...

289
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:04,961
Wait.

290
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,029
Many people have died in Prague
in recent times.

291
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,804
All around me ...

292
00:26:40,403 --> 00:26:43,303
Derek, Peter ...

293
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,630
They were run
by the Communists?

294
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:49,520
No, I'm talking
about people who simply die.

295
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,430
Because of the sadness.

296
00:26:52,634 --> 00:26:54,360
Despair ...

297
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,820
It is a very sad life.

298
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,950
And you ...
You're not sad ?

299
00:27:02,602 --> 00:27:04,560
I keep thinking about me.

300
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:08,227
And when I think of me,
I feel my heart beat weakly.

301
00:27:10,032 --> 00:27:12,920
I say, "Madeleine quickly,
Madeleine think of me ... "

302
00:27:12,956 --> 00:27:16,620
"Think of me ..." But my
heart remains weak.

303
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,904
So I start to scream ...

304
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,920
"Madeleine ... Madeleine ..."

305
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,360
"... Think of me."

306
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:28,087
You must hear me because ...

307
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:30,360
I feel my heart
beating again

308
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:32,520
little by little.

309
00:27:33,905 --> 00:27:35,730
Don't mess with me.

310
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,751
There's something between us that ...

311
00:27:38,811 --> 00:27:41,450
no divorce can
make disappear.

312
00:27:41,942 --> 00:27:43,980
So why are we divorced?

313
00:27:44,056 --> 00:27:46,156
It's a good question.

314
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,360
Why you married a policeman,
is also a good question.

315
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,170
He's not a policeman, he's a guard.

316
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,870
It's the same thing.

317
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,670
He's the perfect man for me.

318
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,320
I'd pay to see that!

319
00:28:03,008 --> 00:28:06,028
Tell me about Vera.
She's not a good writer.

320
00:28:06,126 --> 00:28:08,706
Liar. She writes every
month, I make her.

321
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,402
Force you mean.
She doesn't like writing, is that it?

322
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,410
Yes, she's 14 and does not
want to do anything, it's normal.

323
00:28:15,105 --> 00:28:17,150
She looks like you.

324
00:28:21,807 --> 00:28:24,940
<i> You know what?
That girl is really his daughter. </i>

325
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:28,230
<i> She wants to see everything
Paris is not enough </i>

326
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,530
<i> She likes nothing
and wants to make her big exit. </i>

327
00:28:31,823 --> 00:28:34,623
<i> The smell of the trains,
the noise from airports. </i>

328
00:28:35,008 --> 00:28:38,028
<i>She can't be
quiet anywhere </i>

329
00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:41,006
<i> I wonder if she
is vain </i>

330
00:28:41,076 --> 00:28:44,302
<i>If she uses the mirror
and abuses her beauty </i>

331
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:47,650
<i> She doesn't like anything,
except going out at night </i>

332
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:50,820
<i>She gives her hand
to anyone at random, </i>

333
00:28:51,225 --> 00:28:53,920
<i> To resume it later. </i>

334
00:28:54,013 --> 00:28:56,920
<i>Miss  </i>

335
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,918
<i> Is it ... </i>

336
00:29:00,635 --> 00:29:03,815
<i>As you told me
before, tell me. </i>

337
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:06,733
<i> The son of a fish is fishy! </i>

338
00:29:06,873 --> 00:29:10,033
<i>-Miss ...
-What do you know? </i>

339
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:13,360
<i>-Is she ...
-You should see her. </i>

340
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:16,550
<i>She is more like
to you than you think </i>

341
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,850
<i> The son of a fish is fishy! </i>

342
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:24,320
<i> You know what?
That girl is really his daughter. </i>

343
00:29:24,378 --> 00:29:27,630
<i> Her eyes are so black
that they sometimes seem frightening. </i>

344
00:29:27,921 --> 00:29:30,730
<i> your skin.... I
remember the smell </i>

345
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:34,078
<i> and of your skin
I remember the feel. </i>

346
00:29:34,226 --> 00:29:37,230
<i> My God I cannot lie </i>

347
00:29:37,271 --> 00:29:40,340
<i>I wonder if
this girl is beautiful </i>

348
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,370
<i> Without lipstick,
or painted eyebrows ... </i>

349
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,720
<i>As lovely as you
so that all the others are jealous </i>

350
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:50,000
<i>She has breasts
beautiful as these </i>

351
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:53,180
<i> her waist,
say yes. </i>

352
00:29:53,329 --> 00:29:56,039
<i> Miss ... </i>

353
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,220
<i> Is she ... </i>

354
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:03,250
<i> As you were, tell me. </i>

355
00:30:04,106 --> 00:30:06,076
<i> The son of a fish is fishy! </i>

356
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,257
<i>-Miss ...
-What do you want to know? </i>

357
00:30:09,335 --> 00:30:12,540
<i>-Is she ...
-You should see her. </i>

358
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,760
<i>She is more like
with you than you think. </i>

359
00:30:17,026 --> 00:30:19,050
<i> the son of a fish is fishy! </i>

360
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:23,520
<i>I wonder if
the girl is like you </i>

361
00:30:23,582 --> 00:30:26,740
<i> Without memories,
selfish and worry </i>

362
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,870
<i> Playful and joyful
is it inherited? </i>

363
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,144
<i>This happy amnesia that you
are living every day. </i>

364
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,530
<i> As if for the first time </i>

365
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:39,130
<i> Miss ... </i>

366
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,380
<i> Is she ... </i>

367
00:30:43,094 --> 00:30:46,320
<i> As you were that age. </i>

368
00:30:47,502 --> 00:30:49,302
<i> The son of a fish is fishy! </i>

369
00:30:49,424 --> 00:30:52,570
<i>-Miss ...
Playful and lively, </i>

370
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:55,879
<i>-Is she ...
An idiot-happy ... </i>

371
00:30:55,901 --> 00:30:58,960
<i>Is that what you think of me </i>

372
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,240
<i> The son of a fish is fishy! </i>

373
00:31:03,427 --> 00:31:06,607
<i>If  what you think of me ... </i>

374
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:08,719
<i> Son-fish, little fish is!
-Shut up. </i>

375
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,640
You know what I think very well.

376
00:31:12,023 --> 00:31:14,123
Her power is crazy
men

377
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,028
desire her for their selfish joy.

378
00:31:17,908 --> 00:31:19,820
It's your fault.

379
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,203
They say "ready", I am
in love with an egoist.

380
00:31:27,823 --> 00:31:30,023
I don't understand
what you are saying.

381
00:31:31,102 --> 00:31:33,420
You've lost much of
your French, you know?

382
00:31:34,064 --> 00:31:36,620
Is it a compliment or a
criticism that you're giving?

383
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,170
Did you know that it's sad when a man
needs to change his idea of love

384
00:31:40,202 --> 00:31:42,552
in the middle of a sentence?

385
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,865
Because of
lack of vocabulary.

386
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,160
Yes, it was more a compliment.

387
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,670
Thank you.

388
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,750
I can get a visa, you know?

389
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:57,320
They explained to me all the documents,
procedures ...

390
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,560
I'll stay. If you and Vera come
with me immediately.

391
00:32:02,707 --> 00:32:04,760
Why do you always do this?

392
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,346
I love you.

393
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,535
Jaromil.

394
00:32:22,018 --> 00:32:25,020
Don't laugh. No one's allowed to enter here.

395
00:32:25,502 --> 00:32:27,702
Do you know ... Do you know
that to seek political asylum

396
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,820
I have to ask the police.

397
00:32:30,002 --> 00:32:33,402
Maybe I can address the problem,
whilst you're packing your bags.

398
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,150
I'm not taking a bag.

399
00:32:38,528 --> 00:32:40,508
And don't make noise, run.

400
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:46,120
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

401
00:32:48,429 --> 00:32:50,379
Stop!

402
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,861
Quick!

403
00:33:03,304 --> 00:33:05,274
Vera?

404
00:33:05,505 --> 00:33:07,575
-Vera are you home?
I'm here.

405
00:33:11,609 --> 00:33:14,350
It's Jaromil. Your father.

406
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,650
No greeting?

407
00:33:28,604 --> 00:33:30,644
We're leaving.

408
00:33:31,128 --> 00:33:34,170
We are three, the family.
François Gouriot, Understand?

409
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,280
Go pack your school things.

410
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,143
Take some clothes and put them in the trunk
that's in the hallway.

411
00:33:39,144 --> 00:33:41,280
The rest we can get
later, okay?

412
00:33:41,439 --> 00:33:44,019
-Return to Prague?
-No, no ... Don't worry.

413
00:33:44,401 --> 00:33:46,821
But you have to be quick,
we don't have much time.

414
00:33:48,706 --> 00:33:51,860
It's Dad returning.
He'll wonder where I am.

415
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:55,150
Take him to your room.
Hide under the bed.

416
00:33:55,276 --> 00:33:57,206
Go with her.

417
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,920
-Dear.
-Where were you?

418
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:06,119
I said, I went shopping.
I was looking for a desk for the lounge.

419
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,630
Oh yes. How was it?

420
00:34:07,677 --> 00:34:09,670
I didn't find anything.

421
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,370
I searched everywhere,
I'm exhausted.

422
00:34:13,711 --> 00:34:16,710
-And you?
-Had a good day?

423
00:34:16,865 --> 00:34:19,025
-But you have to go back?
-Yes.

424
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,240
You work too much, dear.

425
00:34:24,006 --> 00:34:25,836
Vera ...

426
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:28,530
Vera, I won't say ...

427
00:34:28,578 --> 00:34:31,220
your mother
has not be educated as she should

428
00:34:32,224 --> 00:34:35,630
But you lack, baby,
a father's words.

429
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,379
The authority ...

430
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,690
Especially now
you are 14.

431
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:43,720
I'm not afraid to say
unpleasant things.

432
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,650
You are my daughter
and must be worthy.

433
00:34:47,824 --> 00:34:50,304
Understand, dignity is the ...

434
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:52,024
most important thing for me.

435
00:34:52,804 --> 00:34:54,520
It's the alpha and omega.

436
00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:58,420
The moral backbone is dignity.

437
00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:00,659
Vera.

438
00:35:01,026 --> 00:35:04,420
Believe your father, dear.
It is important when we are

439
00:35:04,709 --> 00:35:07,231
front of the mirror every morning
when shaving.

440
00:35:07,232 --> 00:35:11,430
we are not obliged to spit at our own face.

441
00:35:12,414 --> 00:35:14,014
I don't shave in the morning.

442
00:35:14,088 --> 00:35:17,028
-But if you put make up on?
-I don't wear make-up.

443
00:35:18,026 --> 00:35:21,026
You're right, it's useless.

444
00:35:21,825 --> 00:35:25,230
But the idea works,
work when you comb.

445
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:29,610
Every day
take stock of the previous day.

446
00:35:29,779 --> 00:35:31,730
and always before
a temptation, say:

447
00:35:31,775 --> 00:35:35,320
no ... tomorrow morning when I shave
I will not be happy.

448
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,380
When I comb my hair?

449
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:39,420
combing hair, yes.

450
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,700
I think it's very clear.
Where are you sleeping?

451
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,592
In a hotel near the Place Clichy.

452
00:35:47,094 --> 00:35:49,420
Tonight that will be our home
and tomorrow ...

453
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,720
and tomorrow we'll go
to the home of your aunt.

454
00:35:51,777 --> 00:35:54,250
You're really going to spend all
of your life with us?

455
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,130
What is your mother doing?

456
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,820
You do not hear anything more.

457
00:36:05,406 --> 00:36:07,690
I don't think it's a good idea
that you go out these.

458
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:10,359
I'll be careful.

459
00:36:59,825 --> 00:37:02,230
You know, it was easy ...

460
00:37:03,209 --> 00:37:06,089
It was cowardly,
what I did, leaving Prague ...

461
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,300
escape.

462
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:11,280
He said he wanted to stay,
wanted to resist ...

463
00:37:11,373 --> 00:37:13,830
But would I resist?
The communists?

464
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:15,670
It was not my problem.

465
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:19,322
My problem was you,
You had a bright future.

466
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,316
I couldn't survice
alone in Paris.

467
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,767
He doesn't understand.

468
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,820
He always believed
I'd be back.

469
00:37:33,133 --> 00:37:35,043
He never knew

470
00:37:35,078 --> 00:37:37,930
how difficult it is to get
a corner of our own.

471
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:41,450
I made a living however I could.

472
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,320
Now, he's returned, he wants me...
then he doesn't want me anymore.

473
00:37:47,605 --> 00:37:50,035
Your father is just a man, Vera.

474
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,160
Your father is perverse.

475
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:58,037
Your father is a bastard.

476
00:38:01,454 --> 00:38:03,350
Vera, where you going?

477
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,650
It was the end of the Passer family.

478
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,138
The end of the story
the whore and the infidel.

479
00:38:25,105 --> 00:38:27,515
I am the sex life of
my parents, it's just who I am.

480
00:38:28,516 --> 00:38:31,168
If I look inside myself,
that's the story I see.

481
00:38:32,002 --> 00:38:34,102
I was in the street, it was cold.

482
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,464
I no longer knew whether I was
angry with them

483
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,320
I just remember wanting
be loved intensely that night.

484
00:38:41,502 --> 00:38:43,920
I wanted to understand what
caused me much pain.

485
00:38:52,235 --> 00:38:55,015
<i> Everything was so peaceful,
everything is silent </i>

486
00:38:56,002 --> 00:38:58,922
<i> a dream at night that passes </i>

487
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,170
<i> They talk about it,
but don't look at me. </i>

488
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:06,613
<i> They are no more than I </i>

489
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:08,968
<i>How I wish  </i>

490
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,750
<i>How I don't want to know </i>

491
00:39:14,745 --> 00:39:18,650
<i>For a sigh,
how many shots? </i>

492
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,022
<i>Everything is so calm
apparently </i>

493
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:33,024
<i> a dream at night that passes </i>

494
00:39:34,035 --> 00:39:36,130
<i> When finally he just loves me </i>

495
00:39:36,198 --> 00:39:38,198
<i> But just not enough. </i>

496
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:40,350
<i>Only it's a lot to me. </i>

497
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:43,028
<i> How it makes me </i>

498
00:39:44,512 --> 00:39:46,860
<i>loved and alive </i>

499
00:39:48,763 --> 00:39:52,820
<i> For a caress,
these scratches? </i>

500
00:40:00,222 --> 00:40:03,322
<i>Everything is so calm
after the dance </i>

501
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:07,205
<i> a dream at night that passes </i>

502
00:40:08,143 --> 00:40:10,180
<i>When you finally loved me </i>

503
00:40:10,237 --> 00:40:12,270
<i>You act so formally  </i>

504
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,220
<i> love I don't know </i>

505
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,120
<i> How hard is it ... </i>

506
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,720
<i> of cold beds </i>

507
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:26,620
<i> For those screams a whisper? </i>

508
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:37,320
<i> Everything is so calm,
a great calm. </i>

509
00:40:38,309 --> 00:40:41,450
<i> a dream at night that passes </i>

510
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,220
<i>When I finally love,
that's it ... </i>

511
00:40:44,265 --> 00:40:46,345
<i>What grants me this offense </i>

512
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:48,620
<i> the warm refuge of your arms </i>

513
00:40:48,902 --> 00:40:51,032
<i>As everything is past </i>

514
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,067
<i> time yesterday </i>

515
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,005
<i> For a summer, how many winters </i>

516
00:41:06,924 --> 00:41:09,124
<i> How many winters </i>

517
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:17,205
<i> How many winters </i>

518
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:25,073
<i> How many winters </i>

519
00:51:25,701 --> 00:51:28,251
<i>Here in London
I'm calling, I don't know where. </i>

520
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:32,076
<i>I must have confused
fog with blur. </i>

521
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,460
<i> It's the fog </i>

522
00:51:35,986 --> 00:51:38,086
<i>Or that I'm black? </i>

523
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:42,910
<i>Here in London
I'm calling for those who don't know </i>

524
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:46,608
<i> no answer,
taxi stand empty </i>

525
00:51:47,043 --> 00:51:49,003
<i>It's the Thames  </i>

526
00:51:50,546 --> 00:51:52,646
<i>Or that I'm  gray </i>

527
00:52:20,105 --> 00:52:23,085
<i>Here in London, I'm calling
I don't know how long </i>

528
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:26,600
<i>Big Ben must have melted,
I don't know what time it is. </i>

529
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,011
<i>It's Oxford Street </i>

530
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,905
<i> or that I'm sad? </i>

531
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:09,130
<i> This isn't the Hyde Park </i>

532
00:53:10,626 --> 00:53:12,820
<i> I can't find any signs </i>

533
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:17,360
<i>Here in London
I don't know how I call </i>

534
00:53:18,031 --> 00:53:21,301
<i> must be bored
is still waiting for me </i>

535
00:53:21,675 --> 00:53:23,780
<i>Is it Westminster </i>

536
00:53:25,305 --> 00:53:27,405
<i>Or you that awaits me? </i>

537
00:53:56,571 --> 00:53:58,820
-Clément, what are you doing here?
-What?

538
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:01,790
Where were you?
I was worried.

539
00:54:01,931 --> 00:54:05,011
You forgot your coat.
Were you cold?

540
00:54:17,315 --> 00:54:19,230
Sir, madame

541
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,570
What happened?

542
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:26,170
What happened?
Did he upset you?

543
00:54:26,225 --> 00:54:28,175
No, I'm so tired.

544
00:54:28,439 --> 00:54:30,510
I was sad, predictable.

545
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,104
Nandita decided
I should go to sleep.

546
00:54:37,503 --> 00:54:40,450
What a crazy psycho fuck.
She thinks she's my mother.

547
00:54:42,003 --> 00:54:44,123
She wouldn't let me
touch her breasts.

548
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:52,650
That's not fair, your room
is much bigger than the mine.

549
00:54:52,878 --> 00:54:54,870
I'll sleep here.

550
00:54:58,043 --> 00:55:01,150
I don't know. Promise to
behave? Clement?

551
00:55:01,225 --> 00:55:03,060
I promise.

552
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:05,170
No sex between us.

553
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:07,410
Not even the idea of sex.

554
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:10,536
Together.

555
00:55:15,113 --> 00:55:17,293
My belts stuck, it wonm't unbuckle.

556
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:19,436
-Can you help me?
-Yes.

557
00:55:22,505 --> 00:55:24,595
But what happened here?

558
00:55:25,206 --> 00:55:27,320
Pull the other side.

559
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:30,225
Wait.

560
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,386
Let's sit down, it'll be easier.

561
00:55:46,104 --> 00:55:48,560
Like it when I grab that?

562
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,621
No.

563
00:55:54,602 --> 00:55:57,350
And when I give you
a kiss, you don't like it?

564
00:55:58,824 --> 00:56:01,014
No, don't be angry.

565
00:56:17,003 --> 00:56:18,553
Wait.

566
00:56:18,619 --> 00:56:20,519
Who is it?

567
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:22,702
Be careful.

568
00:57:21,802 --> 00:57:24,620
-No problem.
Ah, yeah! I'm sorry.

569
00:57:32,524 --> 00:57:34,660
The beaver is sleeping?

570
00:57:36,223 --> 00:57:38,383
You know why they
have a flat tail?

571
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:41,704
It is because I have a flat tail
that you're calling me a beaver?

572
00:57:42,218 --> 00:57:44,420
It's because they were sucked by ducks.

573
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:09,071
200 pages and that was more a documentary ...

574
00:59:18,002 --> 00:59:20,170
Then reread these 200 pages

575
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:22,770
I threw away erased that I didn't like

576
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:25,250
about the teacher.

577
00:59:33,484 --> 00:59:36,620
Perhaps to keep the teacher
character as a novelist.

578
01:00:56,001 --> 01:00:58,023
It was fun.

579
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:17,750
You don't do that. I asked
you to be here.

580
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:19,910
Got it? go away, go away.

581
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:22,470
You don't know me,
so don't touch me!

582
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,430
-You don't know me.
-Don't touch me.

583
01:01:25,313 --> 01:01:28,303
Got it?
I'm not afraid of you, fuck you.

584
01:01:28,611 --> 01:01:30,811
-I'm not afraid ...
Clément-!

585
01:01:31,028 --> 01:01:33,410
-Come on.
- ... I'm not afraid of you.

586
01:01:33,577 --> 01:01:35,640
You do not do that
when I'm here.

587
01:01:35,779 --> 01:01:38,320
Do not be a whore
when I'm here.

588
01:01:39,177 --> 01:01:41,370
And you stay here now.

589
01:01:47,211 --> 01:01:49,111
Come, Nandita.

590
01:02:25,457 --> 01:02:28,067
What are you doing here?
You were due back tomorrow.

591
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:30,280
Father, please put on some underwear.

592
01:02:40,019 --> 01:02:42,719
I didn't warn you,
because it wasn't planned.

593
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:50,730
you are beautiful, my daughter,
so beautiful.

594
01:02:52,118 --> 01:02:54,572
19 years I haven't not seen you.

595
01:02:54,573 --> 01:02:57,028
I never forgot that
I had a daughter.

596
01:02:57,515 --> 01:03:00,305
I came back. I'm here and I'll stay.

597
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:02,805
I am living in the home of your aunt.

598
01:03:03,024 --> 01:03:05,170
But I'll get a house.

599
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,384
You are beautiful.

600
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:12,270
So let me get this straight, you're going to
leave Reims and come back to Paris?

601
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:14,200
No, no, no ...

602
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:18,490
Your mother will not
leave Mr. Gouriot.

603
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:20,750
No, no ... he's retirement.

604
01:03:20,869 --> 01:03:24,330
She needs him to have
a more peaceful life.

605
01:03:24,376 --> 01:03:26,410
You won't understand.

606
01:03:27,526 --> 01:03:30,026
I was talking with your father ...

607
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:32,520
-He began to caress me ...
No, stop mother ...

608
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:34,100
I don' want to know.

609
01:03:34,149 --> 01:03:36,210
We didn't want
go to go to a hotel.

610
01:03:36,259 --> 01:03:37,770
I had the keys to your home.

611
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:40,430
I wanted to see where
my daughter lives.

612
01:03:40,477 --> 01:03:42,537
-Really?
-Yes.

613
01:03:43,942 --> 01:03:46,060
-Why come back early?
-No reason.

614
01:03:46,304 --> 01:03:48,104
Restaurant ...

615
01:03:48,164 --> 01:03:50,074
Let's all go out to eat.
As a family!

616
01:03:50,123 --> 01:03:52,330
I can't, I have to
catch the 7pm train.

617
01:03:52,374 --> 01:03:54,274
You don't have a choice, we're goiong out to eat.

618
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,170
You only need to tell François ...

619
01:03:56,176 --> 01:03:58,806
I want you to dine with me
and take the last train.

620
01:03:58,988 --> 01:04:01,310
You are forcing me
lie and I don't like it.

621
01:04:01,826 --> 01:04:04,036
What?
-Nothing, nothing.

622
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,620
-It's beautiful.
What?

623
01:04:07,401 --> 01:04:10,150
To see the two of you together is beautiful.

624
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,520
I feel sorry for François.

625
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:17,820
He's no saint.

626
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:23,120
One day, I had sex
with a man in the barracks.

627
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:27,501
And I picked up an infection.
I had to talk to him.

628
01:04:28,209 --> 01:04:30,420
It was like walking on eggs,
I was so nervous.

629
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:34,330
No sooner had told him that maybe
had an infection

630
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,470
than he dropped to his knees,
dropped to the floor

631
01:04:36,532 --> 01:04:38,270
Saying that I should
forgive him

632
01:04:38,318 --> 01:04:41,078
that this woman had bewitched him,
but he wouldn't see her again.

633
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,850
Such a drama!

634
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,320
Do you really need to tell me
this kind of thing, Mum?

635
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:49,022
Just to give you an example.

636
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:51,419
For you to know
your mother is not the devil ...

637
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:53,520
Francois and Gouriot
are not saints.

638
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:56,322
And my father,
thinking of going back to see him?

639
01:04:57,652 --> 01:04:59,702
What do you advise me?

640
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:03,520
Would you be happy?
That's the question.

641
01:05:03,725 --> 01:05:06,730
This is something that'll only be known in time,
It's not worth thinking about now.

642
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:09,709
Yes .. So you're
thinking of returning to see him.

643
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,320
If he wants to ... Perhaps, yes.

644
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:15,150
You'll be waiting
by the phone, trust me.

645
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:17,850
You'll keep me informed?

646
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,550
-And you? And your love?
No, shut your mouth!

647
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:24,520
I can't ask?

648
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:28,873
It's too much.

649
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:31,350
I found a person in London,
an American.

650
01:05:31,475 --> 01:05:33,405
What's he like?

651
01:05:33,708 --> 01:05:35,278
He's very cute.

652
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:38,320
He's very seductive, he's perfect
and he's gay.

653
01:05:39,115 --> 01:05:41,015
That annoying.

654
01:05:41,535 --> 01:05:43,950
I advise you not fall in love.

655
01:05:44,914 --> 01:05:47,014
On the other hand, it could be amusing.

656
01:05:49,704 --> 01:05:52,064
<i> I wanted to please </i>

657
01:05:54,104 --> 01:05:56,024
<i> become </i>

658
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:59,960
<i>A light-hearted girl </i>

659
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:03,720
<i>To free myself  </i>

660
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:09,320
<i>My heart is heavy
and the reason </i>

661
01:06:09,974 --> 01:06:13,304
<i> is that love is made of lead </i>

662
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,970
<i> Everything weighs, everything stops. </i>

663
01:06:17,248 --> 01:06:20,448
<i> What is the weight of feeling </i>

664
01:06:24,858 --> 01:06:27,320
<i>This daughter, like mother </i>

665
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,820
<i>So I'll stay  </i>

666
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:35,170
<i>A light-hearted woman </i>

667
01:06:36,653 --> 01:06:38,670
<i>To avoid  </i>

668
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:44,205
<i>A heavy heart
and its mysteries </i>

669
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:48,010
<i> love is like a bag of stones </i>

670
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:52,204
<i> Everything weighs,
everything that harms </i>

671
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:55,750
<i> never be sorry, just be</i>

672
01:07:00,104 --> 01:07:02,720
<i> But, much as I try </i>

673
01:07:04,179 --> 01:07:06,270
<i> I just keep falling in love </i>

674
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:10,320
<i>The light-hearted girl </i>

675
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:14,173
<i> has a heavy heart </i>

676
01:07:15,607 --> 01:07:19,407
<i>A heavy heart
always takes </i>

677
01:07:19,967 --> 01:07:23,307
<i>The light-hearted girls
and one day </i>

678
01:07:24,135 --> 01:07:27,470
<i>We have this feeling
of failure </i>

679
01:07:27,808 --> 01:07:31,408
<i> of being superficially
abandoned </i>

680
01:07:35,208 --> 01:07:38,480
<i> A heavy heart, forget it! </i>

681
01:07:39,526 --> 01:07:42,750
<i> This superficiality,
I offer you </i>

682
01:07:43,221 --> 01:07:46,301
<i> You know that it risks nothing </i>

683
01:07:46,733 --> 01:07:49,633
<i>Do you get
superficially disappointed </i>

684
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:01,270
<i> to please him </i>

685
01:08:03,024 --> 01:08:05,100
<i> I went back to play </i>

686
01:08:06,607 --> 01:08:09,057
<i>the light-hearted girl </i>

687
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,508
<i> I tried </i>

688
01:08:14,228 --> 01:08:17,708
<i>But now my
heart weighs a ton </i>

689
01:08:18,723 --> 01:08:22,083
<i>This superficiality leaves me </i>

690
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:25,308
<i> it's an amazing burden </i>

691
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:29,410
<i> That's the weight of feeling </i>

692
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:07,301
I heard you get up,
my dear.

693
01:09:07,444 --> 01:09:09,540
I found the Jaquis,
this morning at the bakery.

694
01:09:09,618 --> 01:09:12,119
He invited us for a Tarot
session tonight.

695
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:14,570
Very well. Want to go?

696
01:09:14,625 --> 01:09:16,930
Yes, I want to go.
Well, I have to go.

697
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:20,206
I know that you
like the rest of the morning.

698
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,504
But ... What are you doing here?

699
01:09:30,702 --> 01:09:33,770
I didn't satisfy myself yesterday. I'm coming.

700
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:35,887
No, don't come in.

701
01:09:53,403 --> 01:09:55,503
Your ex-husband is here.

702
01:09:57,215 --> 01:09:58,935
Oh yeah?

703
01:09:59,405 --> 01:10:01,205
Yes.

704
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,740
It's beautiful backyard!

705
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,906
Did you plant it, Madeleine?

706
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:07,450
-Yes.
Really?

707
01:10:07,505 --> 01:10:10,325
The orchard, too?
-The backyard is her kingdom.

708
01:10:10,410 --> 01:10:14,030
Truth?
I'll drink more coffee.

709
01:10:15,204 --> 01:10:17,120
Mr. Gouriot ...

710
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:20,240
I will explain
the reason for my visit.

711
01:10:20,406 --> 01:10:23,100
I came here to ask for Madeleine's hand ...

712
01:10:23,272 --> 01:10:24,970
Madeleine

713
01:10:25,028 --> 01:10:26,928
But what is he saying?

714
01:10:27,009 --> 01:10:29,779
Madeleine. I want
her to be my wife.

715
01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:31,620
As in the beginning.

716
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,820
I ask you to give her a divorce.

717
01:10:34,126 --> 01:10:37,820
I don't know if Madeleine
want's one, so I thought ...

718
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,809
it would be better ...

719
01:10:41,121 --> 01:10:44,081
if you were to tell her ...

720
01:10:44,376 --> 01:10:46,450
to leave with me.

721
01:10:46,676 --> 01:10:48,810
My dear,
you should dress.

722
01:10:49,063 --> 01:10:51,630
-Yes.
-I will talk a little with Jaromil.

723
01:10:52,906 --> 01:10:56,560
When you were
the Republican Guard

724
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,645
riding a horse?

725
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:01,460
Don't think I'm stupid.

726
01:11:02,103 --> 01:11:06,500
You know, I know what happened
between you after the divorce.

727
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,909
I found several letters.

728
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:11,930
in which you asked her for photographs

729
01:11:11,932 --> 01:11:15,212
in which you told her to sleep with
other men and then tell you.

730
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:18,120
Madeleine always obeyed you.

731
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:20,807
I endured it.

732
01:11:21,932 --> 01:11:25,012
However, during all
these years it was a heartbreak.

733
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:29,870
I suppose that since you are
in Paris, she will want to see you.

734
01:11:30,802 --> 01:11:32,870
I won't fight it.

735
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:35,300
It is up to Madeleine.

736
01:11:36,277 --> 01:11:38,637
But you can be sure
she will never leave.

737
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:41,670
Because I really love

738
01:11:42,436 --> 01:11:44,486
and respect her.

739
01:11:45,008 --> 01:11:47,120
You can not understand.

740
01:11:48,026 --> 01:11:50,086
You don't respect anything.

741
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:54,130
So listen, I ask
you to leave my house

742
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:56,750
and never return.

743
01:11:57,605 --> 01:11:59,075
Please.

744
01:11:59,104 --> 01:12:01,720
Wouldn't you rather kicked me out on my ass?

745
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,800
He's gone.

746
01:12:32,913 --> 01:12:35,620
-I swear I knew nothing.
-I believe you.

747
01:12:36,013 --> 01:12:37,670
Want a divorce?

748
01:12:37,712 --> 01:12:40,650
No, why? I didn't ask for anything!
-So I hear ...

749
01:12:41,402 --> 01:12:44,520
Never deceive me,
I know that you will never change.

750
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:47,320
I will forget all about  your
relations with her ex-husband.

751
01:12:47,811 --> 01:12:49,630
Sure
He was very pleased

752
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:52,240
to come up here for me
give this great news.

753
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:56,575
I heard nothing,
I don't know anything.

754
01:12:56,576 --> 01:12:59,550
And I do not want anyone else,
besides the two of us know that.

755
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:02,000
Don't say anything to our friends.

756
01:13:02,615 --> 01:13:04,750
Don't tell Vera.

757
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:07,327
Never talk about the subject.

758
01:13:07,831 --> 01:13:10,330
-Continue to be your wife?
-I don't talk about it.

759
01:13:10,331 --> 01:13:12,306
Of course you remain
my wife.

760
01:13:12,379 --> 01:13:14,489
Not if you don't understand
we have more than sex.

761
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,600
-I understood.
-It's up to you.

762
01:13:18,302 --> 01:13:20,242
This man, in my eyes,
does not exist.

763
01:13:21,358 --> 01:13:25,058
I'm going to Nico,
shall I bring crayfish for lunch?

764
01:13:25,208 --> 01:13:27,430
A good idea, crayfish.

765
01:13:43,608 --> 01:13:46,078
Good morning, ma'am.
-Good morning.

766
01:14:03,331 --> 01:14:05,460
I'm sorry.
Can I talk to you a second?

767
01:14:08,325 --> 01:14:10,430
-What is it?
-Damn, you scared me ...

768
01:14:10,470 --> 01:14:12,550
I thought you would not talk
me anymore.

769
01:14:13,105 --> 01:14:15,005
One more.

770
01:14:22,835 --> 01:14:24,820
-Today is the day of presentations

771
01:14:24,863 --> 01:14:26,603
-Yes.
It is the turn-of whom?

772
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:05,520
It's not here.
It must be here, look!

773
01:15:05,521 --> 01:15:07,850
She told me, "Kuntz" behind
the "Gare de L'Est."

774
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:09,780
-Look, "Kuntz".
- "Kuntz."

775
01:15:10,012 --> 01:15:13,380
"Kuntz, Kuntz". It seems
"Apocalypse Now", but in Alsace.

776
01:15:13,422 --> 01:15:15,070
Colonel Kuntz.

777
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,154
What are you doing in there?

778
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,539
My dear!
Clement, I'm glad to see you.

779
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:22,620
Me too, I'm happy.
-And this meeting?

780
01:15:22,621 --> 01:15:24,901
I took advantage of the fact that she
is in Paris for you ...

781
01:15:24,975 --> 01:15:27,680
and bought a birthday present.
It is from me and your father.

782
01:15:27,713 --> 01:15:29,720
-Yes?
We bought it together this afternoon.

783
01:15:29,773 --> 01:15:31,430
Open it, I'm on tenterhooks.

784
01:15:31,450 --> 01:15:33,210
He's staying
on the second floor.

785
01:15:33,211 --> 01:15:35,602
He's sleeping, we shouldn't not wake him.
Coming to the station?

786
01:15:35,603 --> 01:15:38,950
You're not staying?
No, François would be worried.

787
01:15:39,508 --> 01:15:42,058
No, I'm really here for your birthday.

788
01:15:42,928 --> 01:15:45,420
-It is a DVD player.
-How kind.

789
01:15:45,811 --> 01:15:48,970
Don't be like that. We'll have a party
on Sunday anyway.

790
01:15:49,029 --> 01:15:52,260
-You coming, Clement?
-Sure I will.

791
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:55,670
My father is
staying in that hotel?

792
01:15:55,710 --> 01:15:58,470
It's very practical.
I can come and go on the same day.

793
01:15:58,510 --> 01:16:00,329
It is somewhat
my second home.

794
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:02,569
Yes, but whoever has two homes,
has lost their mind.

795
01:16:02,570 --> 01:16:04,670
If you could try not
to have an opinion.

796
01:16:06,773 --> 01:16:08,593
Whenever I want to see him.

797
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:10,470
It worries me to leave him alone

798
01:16:10,502 --> 01:16:13,120
in Paris like this.
I need him.

799
01:16:13,227 --> 01:16:16,320
I need him so much. Good, but
I will not bore you with that.

800
01:16:16,819 --> 01:16:20,209
But you'll have to decide.
You can't hide forever.

801
01:16:20,273 --> 01:16:22,073
But why?
We like it this way.

802
01:16:22,115 --> 01:16:24,470
I must go, or I'll
end up arriving late.

803
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,420
Could we
stop fooling ourselves?

804
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:29,520
-What did you say?
-Nothing. Forget it.

805
01:16:29,621 --> 01:16:31,000
-Have a good journey.
-Yes.

806
01:16:31,001 --> 01:16:32,704
-What?
-I speak of faithfulness ...

807
01:16:32,705 --> 01:16:34,920
It's a good thing
fidelity, when you love someone.

808
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:37,460
-Are you serious?
No, I'm tired.

809
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:39,470
When I'm tired
I'm sentimental.

810
01:16:39,552 --> 01:16:41,660
I'm very tired.

811
01:16:42,008 --> 01:16:44,508
Was that was picked out of love
or because she's tired.

812
01:16:44,906 --> 01:16:47,370
Yeah, I'm encouraged
to regain my strength.

813
01:16:47,429 --> 01:16:48,910
I prefer vitamins.

814
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:50,730
A, B, C, D.
Let's go to the pharmacy.

815
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:52,804
-Want it?
-Slutty.

816
01:17:00,770 --> 01:17:02,920
<i>I would spend hours  </i>

817
01:17:04,533 --> 01:17:06,633
<i> waiting in the rain </i>

818
01:17:08,476 --> 01:17:11,206
<i>I believe
I cry </i>

819
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:14,658
<i>But not cry </i>

820
01:17:16,442 --> 01:17:18,950
<i> water from the sky like a charm </i>

821
01:17:20,309 --> 01:17:22,829
<i> falls on my face destroyed </i>

822
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,874
<i> A parody of tears </i>

823
01:17:28,223 --> 01:17:30,643
<i> Which doesn't fool you </i>

824
01:17:31,804 --> 01:17:33,470
<i> would pass without you </i>

825
01:17:35,724 --> 01:17:37,624
<i> would pass without you </i>

826
01:17:39,814 --> 01:17:41,504
<i> would pass without you </i>

827
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:45,010
<i> would pass for better </i>

828
01:17:52,905 --> 01:17:55,210
<i>I would spend hours  </i>

829
01:17:56,606 --> 01:17:58,786
<i> waiting in my bed </i>

830
01:18:00,406 --> 01:18:02,706
<i>Would you believe I was dying </i>

831
01:18:04,401 --> 01:18:06,401
<i>But I didn't die </i>

832
01:18:08,429 --> 01:18:11,370
<i> Is it just a dream. </i>

833
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:15,110
<i> A dying dream </i>

834
01:18:16,527 --> 01:18:19,287
<i> I'll pretend that I'm dying </i>

835
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,703
<i> hours will not believe </i>

836
01:18:23,859 --> 01:18:25,559

840
01:18:44,802 --> 01:18:47,392
<i>I would spend hours  </i>

841
01:18:48,431 --> 01:18:50,630
<i> Waiting for you
anywhere </i>

842
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:55,025
<i> Would believe that you love me </i>

843
01:18:56,620 --> 01:18:58,558
<i> But you do not love me </i>

844
01:19:00,733 --> 01:19:03,053
<i>For no matter how much I cry or die </i>

845
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:06,469
<i> it doesn't change anything </i>

846
01:19:08,656 --> 01:19:10,806
<i> Our love is only </i>

847
01:19:12,544 --> 01:19:15,150

848
01:19:15,852 --> 01:19:17,452

<i> would pass without you </i>

851
01:19:26,627 --> 01:19:29,427
<i> would pass for better </i>

852
01:19:35,402 --> 01:19:36,940
-The fish is for whom?
Thank you

853
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:38,820
It is for me. Thank you.

854
01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:41,720
-Enjoy.
-This is good.

855
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:44,323
What are you eating?

856
01:19:44,412 --> 01:19:47,302
You should not eat ...

857
01:19:47,472 --> 01:19:49,420
such sophisticated things.

858
01:19:49,469 --> 01:19:51,630
Enough already, don't start.

859
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,730
That's a meal

860
01:19:53,944 --> 01:19:56,820
-French.
-So go on attack.

861
01:19:59,794 --> 01:20:01,830
I was careless.

862
01:20:03,110 --> 01:20:05,320
You? No.

863
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:08,120
It's your mother that is careless.

864
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:11,620
You are brave.

865
01:20:12,910 --> 01:20:15,940
I don't see the courage
to love someone who does not want me.

866
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:18,200
You know what it is to be brave?

867
01:20:18,410 --> 01:20:22,302
You do ... whatever the cost

868
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,720
even knowing ...

869
01:20:25,026 --> 01:20:27,120
that you'll lose.

870
01:20:27,617 --> 01:20:29,627
That's courage.

871
01:20:29,861 --> 01:20:32,560
Courage and caution
are virtues

872
01:20:32,952 --> 01:20:35,770
fundamental.

873
01:20:36,212 --> 01:20:37,802
-Yes?
-Yes.

874
01:20:38,045 --> 01:20:41,420
Our virtues,
Your mother and mine

875
01:20:42,221 --> 01:20:47,141
are carelessness, pride ...

876
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:52,470
pleasure, anger.

877
01:20:54,203 --> 01:20:56,023
Yes.

878
01:20:59,515 --> 01:21:02,540
-You never wear colorful clothes?
-I don't look good in them.

879
01:21:04,015 --> 01:21:05,820
Come ...

880
01:21:05,911 --> 01:21:07,470
I want to buy a dress.

881
01:21:07,538 --> 01:21:09,180
No, you do not have a father.

882
01:21:09,223 --> 01:21:10,870
-No, c'mon, c'mon.
-No.

883
01:21:10,871 --> 01:21:12,171
You can't ...

884
01:21:12,172 --> 01:21:14,240
I am your father and I will buy you
a dress.

885
01:21:14,241 --> 01:21:16,830
You must be married
to wear a sari.

886
01:21:17,174 --> 01:21:19,770
I've never heard such idiocy.

887
01:21:19,909 --> 01:21:22,409
Come on, come on. Go in.

888
01:21:23,202 --> 01:21:25,022
Choose.

889
01:21:25,442 --> 01:21:28,120
This pattern is beautiful, no?

890
01:21:28,706 --> 01:21:31,270
Try this, go into the changing room.

891
01:21:32,524 --> 01:21:35,144
30 years of dictatorship
leaves traces.

892
01:21:36,209 --> 01:21:38,330
You are very cute?

893
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:41,570
This is not pretty
for a girl like you.

894
01:21:41,608 --> 01:21:44,508
Go, go, hurry up.

895
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:47,160
-I have an appointment.
-The changing room is ...

896
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,200
You have a meeting with whom?

897
01:21:49,242 --> 01:21:52,002
With a person
I see in secret.

898
01:21:52,050 --> 01:21:54,700
No daddy, don't start.
Shit.

899
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:59,120
-800 Franks?
-Yes.

900
01:22:02,904 --> 01:22:04,624
Thank you.

901
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:08,120
-So?
I do not know even how to put it on.

902
01:22:08,709 --> 01:22:10,720
You have to tie it.

903
01:22:11,570 --> 01:22:13,462
Hurry up.

904
01:22:14,770 --> 01:22:17,320
You have beautiful legs my dear.

905
01:22:19,103 --> 01:22:21,140
Until Friday, until Friday.

906
01:22:25,623 --> 01:22:27,423
Goodbye.

907
01:22:34,414 --> 01:22:36,314
Look out!

908
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:42,470
Okay? Don't move,
we should send for a doctor ...

909
01:22:42,510 --> 01:22:45,061
-A doctor, no.
-You'd better sit down.

910
01:22:45,207 --> 01:22:47,777
I am a doctor, leave me alone.

911
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,650
Jaromil ...

912
01:24:15,143 --> 01:24:16,803
You are the Vera-Passer?
-Yes.

913
01:24:16,845 --> 01:24:18,805
Can you come with me, please.

914
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,790
This way.

915
01:24:26,805 --> 01:24:28,705
Let's sit down a minute.

916
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:35,440
I just saw the results of the
examination done on your father.

917
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:39,078
The strike caused a mild bleeding
and a concussion.

918
01:24:39,105 --> 01:24:41,570
It is important with a blow
to the head.

919
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:46,230
Unfortunately, the lesions are too
serious for us to operate.

920
01:24:47,204 --> 01:24:49,704
He's been hospitalized
with the rehabilitation service.

921
01:24:53,022 --> 01:24:54,740
Can I see him?
Yes, for sure.

922
01:24:54,775 --> 01:24:57,240
I'll go with you. The nurses
are preparing him.

923
01:24:57,271 --> 01:24:59,221
Want some coffee while we wait?

924
01:24:59,359 --> 01:25:01,540
No, the doctor will see him?

925
01:25:01,570 --> 01:25:04,860
-I am the doctor.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

926
01:25:04,910 --> 01:25:07,015
No offence. This way.

927
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:19,870
I really liked the dress, you know.

928
01:25:22,115 --> 01:25:24,235
You're right,
I look good in pink.

929
01:25:50,004 --> 01:25:52,560
-So?
-We don't know anything yet.

930
01:25:54,370 --> 01:25:56,280
-Cigarette?
-Yes.

931
01:26:03,902 --> 01:26:06,952
-It was nice of you to come.
-That's what friends do.

932
01:26:07,506 --> 01:26:09,570
See how we can be friends?

933
01:26:09,704 --> 01:26:11,780
Finally, this is more like old times.

934
01:26:11,802 --> 01:26:13,722
No, come here.

935
01:26:13,830 --> 01:26:16,670
We were lovers 6 times
a couple for four days and a half,

936
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:20,620
and the 3rd night of the story
we were almost parents.

937
01:26:20,703 --> 01:26:23,260
Yes, in the end just ...

938
01:26:23,663 --> 01:26:25,930
becoming friends,
after completion of a transaction.

939
01:26:26,007 --> 01:26:29,907
It's not true. After sex
there was a little tenderness.

940
01:26:29,943 --> 01:26:32,033
-A great tenderness.
-A great tenderness?

941
01:26:32,130 --> 01:26:34,860
Yes, That now gone.

942
01:26:34,906 --> 01:26:37,170
I think we are too
old for tenderness.

943
01:26:37,175 --> 01:26:39,230
You're not even 30.

944
01:26:40,110 --> 01:26:42,160
Yes, but it's all screwed up.

945
01:26:42,750 --> 01:26:45,450
In one or two years, students
will call you "uncle."

946
01:26:49,719 --> 01:26:52,250
-You got a tattoo?
Not real-shit.

947
01:26:53,005 --> 01:26:55,805
A girl who wrote this
for me to remember her.

948
01:26:56,220 --> 01:26:58,530
I should have taken a bath
before I came, I was stupid.

949
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:02,520
-Not with anyone?
-I'm with Henderson.

950
01:27:03,332 --> 01:27:05,332
How so Henderson.
He came back to see you?

951
01:27:05,370 --> 01:27:08,430
No. I'm always
thinking about him, it's pathetic.

952
01:27:08,672 --> 01:27:10,930
It's impossible to imagine
you with another man.

953
01:27:11,330 --> 01:27:13,050
He's my imaginary husband.

954
01:27:13,070 --> 01:27:16,090
Yes, marriage is more abnormal
since there are weddings.

955
01:27:16,102 --> 01:27:18,020
Do you believe in fate?

956
01:27:18,134 --> 01:27:20,230
I need fresh air.

957
01:27:21,301 --> 01:27:24,060
I have not found a girl
who's neck I'd write on.

958
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:27,273
Why not?
It seems ideal for you.

959
01:27:29,209 --> 01:27:30,970
Where are you going?

960
01:27:31,025 --> 01:27:33,340
Don't you see that is my handwriting?

961
01:27:33,377 --> 01:27:35,307
Why did you do it?

962
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:47,430
Clément. We got lost.

963
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:48,970
-Yes ...
-Know where they put him?

964
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:51,200
Yes, down the hall.
Okay, François?

965
01:28:01,604 --> 01:28:03,564
Vera?

966
01:30:44,502 --> 01:30:46,002
I don't understand.

967
01:30:46,039 --> 01:30:47,479
I shouldn't be here.

968
01:30:47,503 --> 01:30:49,703
I don't understand.

969
01:31:50,819 --> 01:31:52,720
Let's talk in French, then?

970
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:56,630
-Try!
-Okay.

971
01:31:58,824 --> 01:32:00,620
There is one thing I have to tell you

972
01:32:07,610 --> 01:32:10,830
I think I'm HIV positive.

973
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:34,720
Yes, yes. I was super cautious.

974
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:38,520
I was crazy in New York.

975
01:32:39,315 --> 01:32:41,120
Very crazy.

976
01:32:41,224 --> 01:32:45,534
One night,
I found a man in a bar.

977
01:32:46,820 --> 01:32:50,860
I was drunk
I do not remember anything.

978
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:54,720
The next morning in my room ...

979
01:32:55,014 --> 01:32:58,150
Do not remember the sex ...

980
01:32:58,709 --> 01:33:00,830
but I knew I we'd done it ...

981
01:33:01,230 --> 01:33:04,336
without a condom.

982
01:33:08,643 --> 01:33:12,630
How do I cure myself of such stupidity

983
01:33:13,307 --> 01:33:16,720
It makes ...
It makes me fear the worst

984
01:33:22,023 --> 01:33:24,363
I panicked ...

985
01:33:24,745 --> 01:33:27,045
I decided to leave New York.

986
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:32,420
<i> With this kiss I give you. </i>

987
01:34:32,530 --> 01:34:34,800
<i> You'll say I stole it </i>

988
01:34:34,858 --> 01:34:37,270
<i>I feel faint because it makes me feel good  </i>

989
01:34:37,316 --> 01:34:39,550
<i>Say it to me rather than make me </i>

990
01:34:39,580 --> 01:34:42,000
<i>But our kisses are worth nothing </i>

991
01:34:42,115 --> 01:34:44,445
<i> which means
they are priceless </i>

992
01:34:44,502 --> 01:34:46,692
<i> What good can you expect to come of it? </i>

993
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:49,101
<i> What I fear is the worst </i>

994
01:34:49,475 --> 01:34:51,550
<i> Who do you love? </i>

995
01:34:51,581 --> 01:34:53,920
<i> This song that I kept for you</i>

996
01:34:54,607 --> 01:34:56,847
<i> Do you want to play the game? </i>

997
01:34:58,647 --> 01:35:01,050
<i> Who do you love? </i>

998
01:35:01,102 --> 01:35:03,780
<i> not answering, is killing me </i>

999
01:35:06,921 --> 01:35:08,861
<i> Let's stop playing games </i>

1000
01:35:10,746 --> 01:35:13,306
<i> With my hand I reply to you </i>

1001
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:15,634
<i> I still say you're being rash </i>

1002
01:35:15,670 --> 01:35:18,020
<i>I'm trying to be cautious  </i>

1003
01:35:18,110 --> 01:35:20,430
<i> I still say that you're a coward </i>

1004
01:35:20,470 --> 01:35:22,672
<i> Give up, you barely know me </i>

1005
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:25,370
<i> I know enough and I still persist </i>

1006
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:27,470
<i>Someone else
would be more convenient </i>

1007
01:35:27,574 --> 01:35:30,084
<i> Other people are also sad </i>

1008
01:35:30,146 --> 01:35:32,360
<i> Who do you love? </i>

1009
01:35:32,402 --> 01:35:34,630
<i> This song that I kept for you</i>

1010
01:35:35,405 --> 01:35:37,530
<i> Do you want to play? </i>

1011
01:35:39,823 --> 01:35:42,033
<i> Who do you love? </i>

1012
01:35:42,113 --> 01:35:44,370
<i> Don't answer, it'll kill me </i>

1013
01:35:47,773 --> 01:35:49,650
<i> Let's stop playing games. </i>

1014
01:35:51,630 --> 01:35:53,900
<i> I predict failure  </i>

1015
01:35:54,162 --> 01:35:56,430
<i>Only if you cause it  </i>

1016
01:35:56,470 --> 01:35:58,620
<i> I'm trying to curb our impulses </i>

1017
01:35:59,005 --> 01:36:01,075
<i>I still say that you're mocking me. </i>

1018
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:06,027
<i> Why not, my angel? </i>

1019
01:36:06,062 --> 01:36:08,350
<i>This love only raises questions </i>

1020
01:36:08,402 --> 01:36:10,930
<i> In your opinion who is to blame? </i>

1021
01:36:11,020 --> 01:36:13,303
<i> Who do you love? </i>

1022
01:36:13,404 --> 01:36:15,500
<i> This song that I kept for you</i>

1023
01:36:16,310 --> 01:36:18,320
<i> Do you want to play? </i>

1024
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:22,779
<i> Who do you love? </i>

1025
01:36:22,940 --> 01:36:25,170
<i> Don't answer, it'll kill me </i>

1026
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:30,676
<i> Let's stop playing the game </i>

1027
01:36:52,529 --> 01:36:55,409
On 9/11, my daughter embarked
on a plane to New York.

1028
01:36:55,534 --> 01:36:58,160
She said she would
visit her American.

1029
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:00,609
Who had returned to America.

1030
01:37:00,620 --> 01:37:03,250
She said it was Henderson
who asked her to go.

1031
01:37:03,606 --> 01:37:07,040
he had left his boyfriend.
And wanted to see her.

1032
01:37:07,924 --> 01:37:11,300
European flights to New York
were diverted to Canada.

1033
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:13,409
After the attack
against the twin towers.

1034
01:37:13,831 --> 01:37:15,401
Vera landed in Montreal

1035
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:18,090
All flights were suspended.

1036
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:20,570
Stuck there.

1037
01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:23,793
Air France
arranged this hotel.

1038
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:26,120
I don't even know what part
of the city I'm in.

1039
01:37:26,620 --> 01:37:29,390
Henderson will pick me up by car
he has the address.

1040
01:37:30,327 --> 01:37:32,377
Is Montreal near New York?

1041
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:35,408
Give or take,
six hours.

1042
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:36,890
He should arrive tonight.

1043
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:41,630
You had told me that they
lost your bags on the plane.

1044
01:37:42,236 --> 01:37:44,336
They'll send them to New York.

1045
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:49,370
You shouldn't go there.
You should return to France.

1046
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:54,029
Mother, there is no probability
of that happening.

1047
01:38:45,109 --> 01:38:47,470
<i>You've driven here by cars </i>

1048
01:38:49,815 --> 01:38:52,075
<i> An open grave, the night </i>

1049
01:38:54,716 --> 01:38:57,006
<i> All was joy, nothing was right </i>

1050
01:38:57,007 --> 01:38:58,906
<i> Like a drop of water,
anything is possible</i>

1051
01:38:59,312 --> 01:39:01,502
<i> Nows the end of playing games </i>

1052
01:39:04,052 --> 01:39:06,552
<i> What became of your kisses? </i>

1053
01:39:09,003 --> 01:39:11,503
<i>Youth passes  </i>

1054
01:39:14,016 --> 01:39:16,120
<i>And I accept  </i>

1055
01:39:18,648 --> 01:39:21,078
<i>Unfortunately my Summer </i>

1056
01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:25,357
<i>was not a good one</i>

1057
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:30,170
<i> You danced like crazy </i>

1058
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:34,889
<i> lived madly, drunk everything </i>

1059
01:39:37,230 --> 01:39:39,570
<i> You do can't touch the ground anymore </i>

1060
01:39:39,620 --> 01:39:41,754
<i> But now you're on your knees </i>

1061
01:39:42,057 --> 01:39:44,057
<i> the time for songs is over </i>

1062
01:39:46,571 --> 01:39:49,350
<i> What became of your efforts? </i>

1063
01:39:51,980 --> 01:39:54,240
<i>Youth passes  </i>

1064
01:39:56,664 --> 01:39:58,510
<i>And I accept  </i>

1065
01:40:01,445 --> 01:40:04,045
<i>Unfortunately my Summer </i>

1066
01:40:06,115 --> 01:40:08,025
<i>was not a good one</i>

1067
01:40:19,917 --> 01:40:22,217
<i> You've loved so many times </i>

1068
01:40:24,421 --> 01:40:26,930
<i> You were beautiful,
try not think about it </i>

1069
01:40:29,236 --> 01:40:31,530
<i> Because that life ends here </i>

1070
01:40:31,575 --> 01:40:34,130
<i> The bad times will come </i>

1071
01:40:34,170 --> 01:40:36,560
<i>Who broke
This line of flight? </i>

1072
01:40:38,704 --> 01:40:41,520
<i> What happens next? </i>

1073
01:40:44,001 --> 01:40:46,601
<i>Youth passes  </i>

1074
01:40:48,805 --> 01:40:51,105
<i> And nothing can be done </i>

1075
01:40:53,553 --> 01:40:56,103
<i>Unfortunately September </i>

1076
01:40:58,822 --> 01:41:00,222
<i>Has come...  </i>

1077
01:41:45,812 --> 01:41:48,130
The French never
forget to eat.

1078
01:41:48,306 --> 01:41:50,260
Okay ... Don't start!

1079
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:23,197
Mathieu.

1080
01:42:23,722 --> 01:42:25,592
How is New York?

1081
01:42:26,229 --> 01:42:29,509
It's weird ...
distressing, unreal ...

1082
01:42:30,032 --> 01:42:32,630
Strange, a strong smell ...

1083
01:42:33,172 --> 01:42:35,360
like dust burned.

1084
01:42:35,809 --> 01:42:38,210
Sometimes smells of petrol

1085
01:42:42,045 --> 01:42:44,025
You're Henderson's boyfriend?

1086
01:42:44,403 --> 01:42:46,073
Yes more or less.

1087
01:42:46,961 --> 01:42:49,820
I'll see if they're still serving
food in the restaurant.

1088
01:42:50,021 --> 01:42:51,951
Want something?

1089
01:49:24,820 --> 01:49:27,250
Mother, did I wake you up?

1090
01:49:27,420 --> 01:49:30,260
I'm sorry. No, it's okay,
I'm fine.

1091
01:49:30,530 --> 01:49:33,850
We leave tomorrow morning. I'm
very happy to be with Henderson.

1092
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:36,670
Go back to sleep. I love you very much.

1093
01:49:37,420 --> 01:49:40,360
What?
Can't I say that I love you?

1094
01:49:40,612 --> 01:49:42,620
Go back to sleep.

1095
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:03,000
Have they restored the networks?
Do the phones work?

1096
01:50:03,053 --> 01:50:05,193
I don't know, I haven't tried.

1097
01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:08,360
-Am I bothering you?
-No. I'm going to bed.

1098
01:50:08,411 --> 01:50:11,201
-But that stupid. I woke you up?
-Stop ... It's your room.

1099
01:50:11,420 --> 01:50:13,450
Henderson is sleeping.

1100
01:50:22,805 --> 01:50:25,570
Completely wiped-out.
He's a heavy sleeper.

1101
01:50:26,404 --> 01:50:30,000
I'm not sleeping my friends.
Okay?

1102
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:41,760
Want a drink?

1103
01:53:41,538 --> 01:53:43,840
Can you change the channel?

1104
01:53:45,110 --> 01:53:47,010
Yes.

1105
01:54:26,700 --> 01:54:28,420
Before leaving the room

1106
01:54:28,478 --> 01:54:31,058
Vera stole all
of Henderson pills.

1107
01:54:31,910 --> 01:54:33,968
She went to the bar.

1108
01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:38,520
And swallowed them all discreetly.
The whole box.

1109
01:54:39,101 --> 01:54:40,935
A lethal dose.

1110
01:54:40,936 --> 01:54:42,750
Nobody saw her take the pills.

1111
01:55:11,020 --> 01:55:14,250
People remember her
dancing alone in a corner.

1112
01:55:15,109 --> 01:55:17,109
People didn't want to look at her.

1113
01:55:17,601 --> 01:55:19,730
My daughter who
danced through the night.

1114
01:55:19,777 --> 01:55:22,630
They were ashamed.

1115
01:55:23,348 --> 01:55:26,420
And then ... 
those sitting at the bar... they saw nothing.

1116
01:56:34,405 --> 01:56:36,320
We have just seen your mother, Clément.

1117
01:56:36,720 --> 01:56:38,950
Sorry you're sick.

1118
01:56:39,120 --> 01:56:41,102
Your parents were never vaccinated?

1119
01:56:41,196 --> 01:56:44,086
No, it's not worth taking,
unless you're a child.

1120
01:56:44,310 --> 01:56:47,630
I saw on the Internet that pertussis
is infectious for 4 weeks.

1121
01:56:48,004 --> 01:56:50,840
Yeah, I know. But I'm still
tired, be careful.

1122
01:56:50,979 --> 01:56:53,420
We should have called before,
we apologize.

1123
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:57,360
We are ashamed to have
guests, you are sick ...

1124
01:56:57,420 --> 01:57:00,330
That's how we learned of the death
a friend of Madeleine.

1125
01:57:01,420 --> 01:57:04,720
No, but it was a good idea
this invitation, I think that ...

1126
01:57:05,300 --> 01:57:07,012
very good, for you to make a party.

1127
01:57:07,107 --> 01:57:09,140
I will not lie,
we wanted to see you.

1128
01:57:09,201 --> 01:57:11,560
Madeleine has always asked me
to invite you.

1129
01:57:12,077 --> 01:57:14,057
You're the only one present
she wants.

1130
01:57:14,312 --> 01:57:17,280
-It's next Wednesday?
Yes, lunchtime.

1131
01:57:17,604 --> 01:57:21,250
There's a train that arrives at 12:13.

1132
01:57:22,220 --> 01:57:24,620
I confess to being a little afraid
of seeing them.

1133
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:27,557
I don't know if I can
face it all.

1134
01:57:30,726 --> 01:57:32,746
He is saying
won't have the courage.

1135
01:57:32,820 --> 01:57:34,606
What an idiot!

1136
01:57:34,670 --> 01:57:37,620
He can roast and eat their balls,

1137
01:57:37,621 --> 01:57:39,560
Can we count on you,
Clément.

1138
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:41,720
Yeah, I gotta go.
I have ...

1139
01:57:42,029 --> 01:57:44,120
I have to go, a kiss!

1140
01:57:47,888 --> 01:57:49,950
-Okay?
-Stop!

1141
01:57:56,141 --> 01:57:58,141
You're crazy.

1142
01:57:59,704 --> 01:58:01,760
What is it? Yes, Madeleine.

1143
01:58:03,420 --> 01:58:05,480
I told your husband that I would.

1144
01:58:06,620 --> 01:58:09,800
Is that clear enough.
Kate ...

1145
01:58:09,850 --> 01:58:12,820
<i> I say that maybe you'll buy ... </i>

1146
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:15,120
<i> These shoes </i>

1147
01:58:16,610 --> 01:58:19,870
<i> So beautiful and too expensive for me. </i>

1148
01:58:22,700 --> 01:58:25,930
<i> Friday without fail, I will pay ... </i>

1149
01:58:26,009 --> 01:58:27,709
<i> the bill. </i>

1150
01:58:28,706 --> 01:58:32,066
<i> Saturday, go out with you. </i>

1151
01:58:34,334 --> 01:58:36,750
<i> But next Wednesday </i>

1152
01:58:37,723 --> 01:58:40,320
<i>I'm not going to Reims  </i>

1153
01:58:41,820 --> 01:58:44,630
<i> Moreover,
no one goes to Reims </i>

1154
01:58:46,905 --> 01:58:49,575
<i> There's nothing there, </i>

1155
01:58:50,433 --> 01:58:53,502
<i> just cemeteries </i>

1156
01:58:54,114 --> 01:58:57,514
<i> nothing and still less for me. </i>

1157
01:59:00,620 --> 01:59:05,003
<i>I will spend the Sunday at home
between four walls. </i>

1158
01:59:06,825 --> 01:59:10,015
<i> Monday, I will go to the movies. </i>

1159
01:59:13,210 --> 01:59:16,150
<i> Tuesday, I don't know,
but the only thing </i>

1160
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:18,230
<i> I'm sure </i>

1161
01:59:19,310 --> 01:59:22,605
<i> is that on Wednesday,
I'll be here. </i>

1162
01:59:24,811 --> 01:59:27,321
<i> Thursday, whatever. </i>

1163
01:59:28,420 --> 01:59:30,950
<i>I'm not going to Reims  </i>

1164
01:59:32,043 --> 01:59:36,023
<i> Clean the grave,
see the rocks bloom. </i>

1165
01:59:37,401 --> 01:59:40,021
<i> After all, Wednesday </i>

1166
01:59:41,228 --> 01:59:43,620
<i> If it rains inside </i>

1167
01:59:44,420 --> 01:59:48,150
<i> The rain will clean the cemetery </i>

1168
01:59:51,014 --> 01:59:54,104
<i> I won't do it, I have too much to do </i>

1169
01:59:54,620 --> 01:59:56,207
<i> Promise </i>

1170
01:59:57,510 --> 02:00:00,520
<i> I'll be sick, I'll catch a cold. </i>

1171
02:00:03,608 --> 02:00:07,008
<i> that's what's planned for
Reims on Wednesday </i>

1172
02:00:07,208 --> 02:00:08,850
<i>The thermometer</i>

1173
02:00:09,749 --> 02:00:13,349
<i>below zero,
that's why </i>

1174
02:00:15,420 --> 02:00:18,019
<i> Wednesday, I can tell you now </i>

1175
02:00:19,120 --> 02:00:21,750
<i>I'm not going  Reims </i>

1176
02:00:22,620 --> 02:00:26,007
<i> Reims is quite depressing
under the arcades </i>

1177
02:00:28,120 --> 02:00:30,620
<i> Wednesday, it's certain </i>

1178
02:00:31,720 --> 02:00:34,170
<i> that the trains to the region </i>

1179
02:00:35,120 --> 02:00:38,811
<i> will pass winter without me. </i>

1180
02:00:40,620 --> 02:00:43,206
<i> For Wednesday, I've decided </i>

1181
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:46,950
<i> I'm not going to Reims </i>

1182
02:00:47,841 --> 02:00:51,180
<i> Where she nourishes the land </i>

1183
02:00:53,303 --> 02:00:55,750
<i> My God, how I envy </i>

1184
02:00:56,820 --> 02:00:59,350
<i> this land </i>

1185
02:01:00,313 --> 02:01:03,903
<i>Which hugs your body
in its arms </i>

1186
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:42,570
It's Mireille.
Come in, come!

1187
02:01:42,706 --> 02:01:44,570
-Okay?
-Yes.

1188
02:01:44,630 --> 02:01:46,720
Everybody in the lounge.

1189
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:49,653
It's at the back of the house.

1190
02:01:50,016 --> 02:01:52,870
-Okay?
-We waited for you at lunch!

1191
02:01:52,920 --> 02:01:55,869
Lunch was for close friends
Coffee is for the neighbors.

1192
02:01:55,870 --> 02:01:58,058
-Why didn't you come for lunch?
The trains were on strike.

1193
02:01:58,059 --> 02:02:00,200
Only running a skeleton servive,
I had to wait ages.

1194
02:02:00,201 --> 02:02:02,505
I spent the day at the station.
No scolding, please.

1195
02:02:02,549 --> 02:02:05,709
Thank you. Madeleine had
a crisis because you did not come.

1196
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:08,405
She locked herself in her room.
Didn't want to eat.

1197
02:02:08,620 --> 02:02:10,830
I couldn't get
her to leave the room.

1198
02:02:10,970 --> 02:02:13,069
-A cigarette?
-Yes.

1199
02:02:13,220 --> 02:02:15,280
Thank you. Got a light?

1200
02:02:18,620 --> 02:02:20,542
She's upset, you know.
For weeks ...

1201
02:02:20,730 --> 02:02:23,120
had been fine and then out of nowhere.

1202
02:02:23,170 --> 02:02:25,350
She doesn't want to see anyone,
won't speak to me.

1203
02:02:25,504 --> 02:02:28,094
for days ...
And then one morning,

1204
02:02:28,430 --> 02:02:32,670
She makes coffee and laughs.
As if nothing had happened.

1205
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:35,130
Yes, she lost her daughter.
It's no small thing.

1206
02:02:35,310 --> 02:02:37,910
-Now she's all alone.
-All alone ... All alone ...

1207
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:41,540
Shit, what about me?
for 34 years she's lived with me.

1208
02:02:41,590 --> 02:02:44,120
She's not alone.
But how stupid is that?

1209
02:02:47,025 --> 02:02:49,030
If I stay,
will she open the door.

1210
02:02:49,120 --> 02:02:51,170
I've never done this through
a closed door.

1211
02:02:51,213 --> 02:02:53,290
What are you talking about?

1212
02:02:54,820 --> 02:02:58,820
My dear. Clément just
arrived. He's here by my side.

1213
02:02:59,801 --> 02:03:01,720
I'll leave you alone.

1214
02:03:02,220 --> 02:03:04,252
Do something about it.

1215
02:03:09,126 --> 02:03:11,180
Come in.

1216
02:03:14,620 --> 02:03:16,540
Good afternoon.

1217
02:03:16,570 --> 02:03:18,630
Are you alone?

1218
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:22,600
Yes.

1219
02:03:28,220 --> 02:03:30,311
Won't you look at me?

1220
02:03:30,853 --> 02:03:32,953
Don't you want to look at me?

1221
02:03:33,035 --> 02:03:35,165
I'm ugly. I'm tired of crying.

1222
02:03:36,770 --> 02:03:38,920
You never cried before.

1223
02:03:39,820 --> 02:03:42,320
No, you're right.
I never cried so much.

1224
02:03:43,549 --> 02:03:45,680
However, sadness ...

1225
02:03:46,220 --> 02:03:49,020
I was sad,
but I could control myself.

1226
02:03:51,018 --> 02:03:53,068
This is already happening.

1227
02:03:53,220 --> 02:03:56,580
I can put up with ugly faces.
It is not ugly, it's beautiful.

1228
02:03:58,302 --> 02:04:00,180
He said I was depressed?

1229
02:04:00,230 --> 02:04:02,071
No.

1230
02:04:02,156 --> 02:04:04,226
He said you were not well.

1231
02:04:04,730 --> 02:04:07,730
He says it to everyone.
It's crazy, I'm fine.

1232
02:04:08,220 --> 02:04:10,300
There are days when I ...

1233
02:04:10,420 --> 02:04:13,720
I can not look at him.
He's not guilty, so is ...

1234
02:04:15,170 --> 02:04:18,450
You see, there are mornings when
is difficult to say to someone ...

1235
02:04:19,124 --> 02:04:21,104
"I love you"

1236
02:04:21,227 --> 02:04:23,407
thinking, "I don't love you."

1237
02:04:25,115 --> 02:04:27,420
Well, I think that's what happiness is.

1238
02:04:29,420 --> 02:04:31,427
Don't make fun.

1239
02:04:32,851 --> 02:04:35,270
I no longer think about happiness ...

1240
02:04:36,028 --> 02:04:38,030
Not for a long time.

1241
02:04:38,104 --> 02:04:42,104
It doesn't stop me from being happy.
I trust in life ...

1242
02:04:42,714 --> 02:04:44,774
but do not trust happiness.

1243
02:04:48,300 --> 02:04:50,420
You are depressed.

1244
02:04:52,433 --> 02:04:56,403
They are going to light
the candles  ...

1245
02:04:59,320 --> 02:05:01,408
Want to go?

1246
02:05:02,172 --> 02:05:04,260
Really?
-Yes. Seriously.

1247
02:05:06,210 --> 02:05:09,334
Go down for a bit. Blow out the candles
and then come with me, okay?

1248
02:05:10,648 --> 02:05:13,260
Come on. I'll wait below.
Be quick.

1249
02:05:17,803 --> 02:05:21,630
Happy birthday to you ...

1250
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:25,500
Happy birthday to you ...

1251
02:05:25,877 --> 02:05:30,320
Happy Birthday, Madeleine ...

1252
02:05:30,820 --> 02:05:35,730
Happy birthday to you ...

1253
02:05:44,619 --> 02:05:46,579
Blow.

1254
02:05:47,376 --> 02:05:50,306
Congratulations, congratulations.

1255
02:06:25,272 --> 02:06:27,132
Where are you going?

1256
02:06:27,230 --> 02:06:30,130
Clement wants to leave.
I'm going with him to the cemetery.

1257
02:06:30,278 --> 02:06:32,348
Let's look at Vera,
before you catch the train.

1258
02:06:32,406 --> 02:06:34,470
-Want me to take you in the car?
-No.

1259
02:06:34,704 --> 02:06:37,474
Let's walk,
it will do me good, I drank too much.

1260
02:06:37,502 --> 02:06:41,022
-But you're coming back?
-Beautiful your new toy, Jackie.

1261
02:06:41,170 --> 02:06:43,233
Bye, François.

1262
02:06:44,029 --> 02:06:46,089
Bye!

1263
02:07:29,360 --> 02:07:31,384
Okay?

1264
02:07:36,714 --> 02:07:38,750
Vera was a gift for you.

1265
02:07:39,112 --> 02:07:42,102
You were never married, but were 
always in love.

1266
02:07:42,176 --> 02:07:44,030
Don't say stupid things.

1267
02:07:44,077 --> 02:07:46,627
-There are no happy marriages.
-You don't say.

1268
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:49,230
She was never
in love with me.

1269
02:07:49,278 --> 02:07:51,230
-You think so?
-You know.

1270
02:07:51,409 --> 02:07:53,230
No, I do not know.

1271
02:07:53,263 --> 02:07:55,560
Vera always managed
hide her feelings.

1272
02:07:55,704 --> 02:07:58,084
Well, I realized that she loved him.

1273
02:07:59,022 --> 02:08:01,302
-I wouldn't call it love.
-What would you call it?

1274
02:08:02,325 --> 02:08:04,505
She dreamed of being
Henderson's wife.

1275
02:08:05,001 --> 02:08:06,801
If that's not love?

1276
02:08:07,130 --> 02:08:10,123
-A melodrama.
-So you're saying she never loved him.

1277
02:08:10,719 --> 02:08:13,920
That man never loved her.
You were the one who loved her.

1278
02:08:15,230 --> 02:08:18,620
What is better, being the who is beloved
 or being the lover?

1279
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:22,350
His place. I would have given my
life to be in his place.

1280
02:08:23,320 --> 02:08:25,292
You're right.

1281
02:08:27,301 --> 02:08:29,351
Clément, catch the door.

1282
02:08:35,001 --> 02:08:37,061
I'll explain.

1283
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:40,940
You know, I already know the story.

1284
02:08:41,007 --> 02:08:44,190
How you fell in love with a client,
a medical student.

1285
02:08:45,317 --> 02:08:49,217
That didn't work, bringing him to your apartment.

1286
02:08:49,320 --> 02:08:51,260
This part I also know.

1287
02:08:51,411 --> 02:08:54,011
That Vera was conceived,
that first time.

1288
02:08:54,170 --> 02:08:56,306
Your freedom, his joy.

1289
02:08:56,360 --> 02:08:58,820
I was not an easy woman,
by any means.

1290
02:08:59,320 --> 02:09:01,620
At the time it was easy,
very easy.

1291
02:09:01,720 --> 02:09:03,420
But Vera was not conceived here.

1292
02:09:03,470 --> 02:09:05,607
I was just saying,
I don't want to know.

1293
02:09:05,608 --> 02:09:07,668
It was him who wanted me.

1294
02:09:07,704 --> 02:09:11,364
Vera always thought that I was
passionate about her father, but no.

1295
02:09:11,966 --> 02:09:14,420
We spent the night together and then ...

1296
02:09:14,672 --> 02:09:16,912
in the morning I sent him away.

1297
02:09:17,320 --> 02:09:19,382
He didn't want to
He wasn't working.

1298
02:09:23,419 --> 02:09:25,339
I'm not your toy.

1299
02:09:25,418 --> 02:09:27,920
Not my toy?
So what are you?

1300
02:09:27,970 --> 02:09:30,720
-A whore.
-Madeleine, please.

1301
02:09:30,914 --> 02:09:32,930
-I'm in love with you.
-That's absurd.

1302
02:09:32,970 --> 02:09:36,360
-You love all French women.
-I'm not crazy about all French women.

1303
02:09:36,420 --> 02:09:38,920
I'm not crazy about De Gaulle,
just you.

1304
02:09:39,125 --> 02:09:40,925
You're beautiful.

1305
02:09:41,011 --> 02:09:44,401
Today finds me beautiful
and tomorrow, who knows.

1306
02:09:45,203 --> 02:09:47,263
Whether you'll fall for me?

1307
02:09:48,830 --> 02:09:51,670
I am not indifferent
to your Russian charm.

1308
02:09:51,720 --> 02:09:55,950
I'm not Russian.
What do you mean "indifferent"?

1309
02:09:56,314 --> 02:09:58,750
You're allowed to love me.

1310
02:09:59,401 --> 02:10:01,720
Thank you.
-Go away.

1311
02:10:01,809 --> 02:10:04,859
-Bye, Mrs. Whore.
-Goodbye, Mr. Customer.

1312
02:10:07,270 --> 02:10:10,070
Have you ever loved a man?

1313
02:10:11,170 --> 02:10:13,074
You have to go.

1314
02:10:13,449 --> 02:10:16,709
It's something that no
man ever dared to ask you ...

1315
02:10:16,743 --> 02:10:19,023
and are you ready
to do it for me?

1316
02:10:20,609 --> 02:10:23,669
I'm cold.
I feel very cold.

1317
02:10:27,402 --> 02:10:29,520
Love me forever.

1318
02:10:30,120 --> 02:10:32,250
You're forbidden to
love other men.

1319
02:10:33,534 --> 02:10:36,034
There are some people
who spend their lives.

1320
02:10:36,929 --> 02:10:39,609
Who take so long
to understand that ...

1321
02:10:40,021 --> 02:10:42,420
freedom
is the worst offense to love.

1322
02:10:42,920 --> 02:10:44,830
Since the death of Jaromil ...

1323
02:10:44,872 --> 02:10:47,922
I am not the same,
and you've disappeared as well.

1324
02:10:48,711 --> 02:10:51,260
That when he went
so did I

1325
02:10:51,805 --> 02:10:53,860
I no longer recognize myself.

1326
02:10:58,555 --> 02:11:00,660
It's not pretty when you miss someone.

1327
02:11:00,820 --> 02:11:03,403
Mother always said
"It's not pretty when you miss someone."

1328
02:11:06,860 --> 02:11:08,913
Thank you.

1329
02:11:22,020 --> 02:11:25,820
<i>I waited for you to detest me. </i>

1330
02:11:28,670 --> 02:11:32,450
<i>Nothing, nothing more</i>

1331
02:11:35,810 --> 02:11:39,850
<i> Of our love, what remains? </i>

1332
02:11:42,633 --> 02:11:46,180
<i> So little meat and so much blood </i>

1333
02:11:49,812 --> 02:11:53,202
<i> So little meat and so much blood </i>

1334
02:11:56,655 --> 02:11:59,750
<i> you're no longer here, but nothings changed </i>

1335
02:12:03,420 --> 02:12:07,120
<i> The problem remains the same </i>

1336
02:12:10,420 --> 02:12:13,620
<i> I can live without you but ... </i>

1337
02:12:14,120 --> 02:12:17,406
<i> What kills me, my love is ... </i>

1338
02:12:17,510 --> 02:12:20,950
<i> That I can't live without love </i>

1339
02:12:28,805 --> 02:12:32,015
<i> I waited hoping to be excluded </i>

1340
02:12:35,017 --> 02:12:38,787
<i> Nothing, nothing do I feel </i>

1341
02:12:40,912 --> 02:12:45,360
<i> As life passed quickly by. </i>

1342
02:12:48,750 --> 02:12:52,560
<i> Like everything seems slower </i>

1343
02:12:55,809 --> 02:12:59,750
<i> Like everything seems slower </i>

1344
02:13:02,708 --> 02:13:05,920
<i> You're no longer here, but nothings changed </i>

1345
02:13:09,320 --> 02:13:12,450

1346
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:19,970
<i> I can live without you but ... </i>

1347
02:13:20,049 --> 02:13:23,520
<i> What kills me, my love is ... </i>

1348
02:13:23,655 --> 02:13:27,420
<i> That I can't live without love </i>

1349
02:13:34,508 --> 02:13:37,928
<i>I expected the flood  </i>

1350
02:13:41,179 --> 02:13:44,720
<i> Fire and torrential rains </i>

1351
02:13:48,401 --> 02:13:51,971
<i> A torrent as a last wish </i>

1352
02:13:55,178 --> 02:13:59,018
<i> But nothing comes and takes me </i>

1353
02:14:02,028 --> 02:14:05,640
<i> But nothing comes and takes me </i>

1354
02:14:08,808 --> 02:14:12,108
