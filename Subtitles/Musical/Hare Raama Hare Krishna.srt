1
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:02,289
The echoing sound of this Great hymn
''HARE MMA HARE KRISHNA'' -

2
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,293
Through our teachers,philosophers
and lords -

3
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,630
Away from this Motherland of
ours by 1000 miles -

4
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:10,964
Went away at a very
Iong distance

5
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:14,801
Reached till the Western Civilization
of Europe and America -

6
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:18,305
That civilization,which got suppressed by
making its own machines -

7
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,140
And because of the
financial success -

8
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,644
Had forgotton the happiness and peace
of a person outside and within

9
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,022
Became restless to gain the
peace of the soul -

10
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,149
By reaching among
them -

11
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,985
This divine prayer of
''HARE MMA HARE KRISHNA'' -

12
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,489
Had instrumented a new revolution
into their souls-

13
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:40,327
lt worked as an ointment on their
hungry,thirsty and palipitating souls

14
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:28,041
Who are these people who without
understanding the meaning of this great hymn -

15
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:31,712
And have altered the meaning of
this great hymn according to their purport -

16
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,839
And are seated oscillating
and unconscious

17
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:04,745
These people,whose religion is smack
Grass,Cockene,L.S.D -

18
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:08,207
And whose temple is open
physical relationship -

19
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,752
These people are leading every moment
of their lives only for this moment -

20
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,087
They are all lost under the influence
of intoxication and enjoyment -

21
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:17,090
They are all unknown from themselves
unknown from the World -

22
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,427
Unknown from their family members
unknown from the Society

23
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,597
These people,whom the world
addresses them as ''Hippy''-

24
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:24,932
Why are they running away
from life?

25
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,018
These people,whether they have a
problem with life of they love it-

26
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,354
To get an answer on this,why
don't l ask that person-

27
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:34,441
She is Jasbir,my own Jasbir
whom l liked a lot,whom l loved a lot-

28
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,109
My own part,my
own blood-

29
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,112
Jasbir,tell me,what do you want
what's your desire,why are you like this?

30
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,460
Jasbir,what are you doing,you
would have broken the glasses,wear them

31
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,796
Why are you both creating a nuisence
don't you listen to your Nanny

32
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,263
Come on,drink your milk,there's
just half leR in the glass,come on,drink it

33
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:06,974
Oh shit,Jassu,what are
you doing?

34
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,934
Get up and drink your milk
Prashant even you drink-

35
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:10,310
Come on,drink your
milk

36
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:11,478
No

37
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:11,979
No!!

38
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:12,729
No

39
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:14,147
No

40
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:14,815
No

41
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,149
Will you drink
or not?

42
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:16,650
No

43
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,654
Jasbir my sister,how beautiful
a child she is-

44
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,365
What does Jasbir want,what
will Jasbir do?-

45
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:28,453
No one ever tried to find it,
neither Mummy nor Daddy

46
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,499
There's a feast for you,this
evening at the Montreal Club-

47
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,751
You had asked me to remind
you,will you go?

48
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,503
Go and ask
Mrs.Jaiswal

49
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,630
Will she not get angry,if
l go in and ask?

50
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,382
How do l know,you yourself
go and ask

51
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,763
Mrs.Jaiswal,can l disturb you
for a second?

52
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,015
Yes,what's it?

53
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,184
This evening,there's a feast
for you-

54
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,351
lf you are going,then l'll
call them up

55
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,187
Ask Mr.Jaiswal

56
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,938
He told to ask it from
Mrs.Jaiswal

57
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,690
So,can't he himself come
and ask-

58
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,066
He alway's sends
you to me-

59
00:05:58,442 --> 00:05:59,860
Go and tell him,to come
and ask me-

60
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,029
And,don't come infront of me
with this ill-omented face

61
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:05,157
Be thankful,that a decent girl
like Miss Swami work's in this Office-

62
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,201
Had l kept a beautiful and a
fast secretary for myself-

63
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:08,869
Then l would have seen,how you
would have shown your tantrums on her?

64
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,539
Then you wouldn't have sent her
to my room for asking small matters-

65
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:15,542
You would have kept her,
Iocked in your room

66
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:19,755
Today,you have again
broken this glass-

67
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,548
Will you make this your
daily practice-

68
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:24,384
Look at him,he drink's it
without shouting

69
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:25,219
And you...

70
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:26,803
l'll not drink,from
her hands

71
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:28,889
Then,everyday,will l go back
of you,by taking the glass?

72
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:31,058
Alright,come here

73
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,142
You don't come
neaf Me

74
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:34,561
You have removed your
glass and thrown it-

75
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,063
Had it hurt her eyes,
then?

76
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,566
Jassu look,if you don't wear
your glasses-

77
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:41,068
Then,one day you'll not be
able to see anything-

78
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,194
You'll become blind

79
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:43,737
Take my child
drink it

80
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:47,574
Why are you beating
the child?

81
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,577
You have never given me the happiness
then how can l expect it from children?

82
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:55,249
Brother...

83
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,126
Why are you crying,look,how
fast l have drank the milk

84
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:03,507
Brother,Mummy says,l'll not be
able to see anything,l'll become blind

85
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:04,758
That Mummy had told it
out of anger-

86
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:07,302
lf you wouldn't have thrown the glasses
on Nanny,Mummy wouldn't have told that

87
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:11,265
No,l'll not wear the glasses
everybody in the School mocks at me

88
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,268
Then,don't wear them ,wear them in
the House,and remove it in the School

89
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:17,104
Then,According to Mummy,l'll
not be able to see anything

90
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:18,230
Then,keep wearing
them

91
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,025
Look,how nice it
Iooks

92
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:22,442
No...

93
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:24,278
Look at me

94
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:26,905
No,No....

95
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,493
Look at me,look
Iook

96
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:16,051
Prashant,have Mummy and
Daddy come back from the Club?

97
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:19,513
Nanny,have Mymmy and Daddy
come back from the Club?

98
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,184
As though,everyday they come back early
from the Club,that they'll come today

99
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,896
Today,lnfact it's their party,
quietly sleep

100
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,026
What was the necessity of doing
so much of drama?

101
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,528
Who did the drama,
me or you?

102
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,531
l didn't commit any Crime,if l
danced with Miss Lal-

103
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,866
Even,you were
dancing

104
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,661
There is a difference between dancing
and embracing a person-

105
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,497
And,that too with a
third-class woman

106
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:47,541
Mind your language,you
are over drunk

107
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,544
l wasn't drunk that much,that
l couldn't notice your actions-

108
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,005
With that third class
woman,Miss Lal

109
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,756
lf you have seen the actions
then understand

110
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,550
What?

111
00:11:57,593 --> 00:12:01,221
That,the time has come,that l
tell you,that l don't love you at all-

112
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,056
That's because,you don't
Iove me-

113
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:05,893
l love Miss Lal,it's because
she loves me-

114
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,395
And now,it's not good for me to
stay with that woman-

115
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:09,396
Who doesn't have any
concern for me-

116
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:13,233
And now,the time has come that
we get seperated from each other

117
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,069
Yes,so that she comes here,in
this House Instead of me-

118
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:17,571
And makes love
with you

119
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,740
Let that bitch come,l'll slipper
one on her face-

120
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,408
And l'll throw her down from
the window

121
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:25,412
Such prostitutes are sold for few
pennies in all the Club's like Montreal-

122
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:26,747
Even l am seeing it for the
Iast 3 years-

123
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:28,081
Today with this girl,tomorrow
with the other

124
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,584
Whom did you call
a prostitute?

125
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:35,756
Go and throw this glass on the
face of Miss Lal

126
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:37,257
On whom did you
slipper?

127
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:40,427
Don't think,that if you are
embracing her,you can kick me

128
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,429
l am your husband
your busband

129
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,265
Either you go off from here
or l'll go-

130
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,769
And l'll return only then,when your
ill-omented presence will not prevail here

131
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,605
And don't think that l am simply
giving you a threat

132
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,107
l have already got prepared
the divorce papers-

133
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:55,943
l knew that such a situation
would arise

134
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:58,946
Once l leave from here,only
then you'll remember me

135
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:02,950
l'll immidietly call up my Brother,so
that he comes and takes me from here

136
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:06,453
What's the point of staying
in such a House-

137
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:08,455
Where,there's neither happiness
nor peace-

138
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:10,457
Neither there's contenment
nor Respect

139
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,794
At the time of marriage itself
my parents were telling-

140
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:17,464
That without a due thought,you are
marrying a person in a foreign country

141
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,967
God forbidden if...

142
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:27,474
l'll not let my children also,
to stay over here-

143
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:30,644
The law will decide,whether these
children are mine or your's

144
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,522
l have already made the arrangements
for their Boarding School

145
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,148
Jasbir will go to St Mary
School and...

146
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,817
Neither Jassu will stay here
nor will Prashant-

147
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:38,986
Both of them will go back
with me to India

148
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,154
The one who can't take care
of his wife-

149
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:42,155
How will he take care of
their children?

150
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:42,990
Let's see!

151
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:53,500
Mummy,are we going back
to our Country?

152
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:55,335
So,will Jassu come
with Daddy?

153
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:59,173
Son,the court has snatched
my Jassu from me

154
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:03,010
Your Daddy did not want that
she should come with us to India

155
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:07,514
But,you are her big Brother
isn't it-

156
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:09,349
When you grow more
older-

157
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:12,352
You, yourself go and bring her
back to India

158
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:35,042
Now,neither you are Miss
nor Lal

159
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:49,890
Jassu,my child,what happened
did you get any dream,what happened?

160
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:55,395
Where is Prashant,call
Prashant,l'll go to him

161
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,235
l have sent Prashant to India
along with your Mother-

162
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:04,071
When you grow old,you go
and meet Prashant

163
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:08,242
So,will Mummy and Prashant
not come back again?

164
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,411
Look,my child,children should
be given good Education-

165
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,247
So that,they become intelligent
when they grow old-

166
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:14,748
They should become
self-sufficient-

167
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:18,085
That's why,sometimes for studies
they should go far from the House

168
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,753
Prashant will study
in India

169
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:23,090
And we'll send you to the boarding
School of St Marys-

170
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:26,593
Where good students study,so that
when you grow old...

171
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:28,428
You don't talk
to me

172
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:31,265
Jassu,is this the way of
talking to elders?

173
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:32,766
Now she is only
your Mother

174
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,768
No...,She is not
my Mother

175
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,938
lt would be good,if you send her to the
Boarding School as soon as possible-

176
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:38,647
She'll get refined

177
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:43,610
Give her to me,l'll make her lay
on the bed,you go and take rest,Go

178
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:49,783
Come on child,quietly go
to sleep-

179
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:53,120
And now if you cry, a witch
would enter from that door

180
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:55,789
Nanny,when will Prashant
come back?

181
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:58,625
My child,now Prashant will
never come back

182
00:15:59,334 --> 00:15:59,626
Why?

183
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:02,462
Your Daddy has done a
second marriage-

184
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,631
She is your new mother in
that room

185
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:09,803
So,my mother is no more my
mother who leR me and went away

186
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:20,314
My child,your mother has
died forever-

187
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:23,483
And along with her
even Prashant

188
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:25,485
So,even Prashant
has died

189
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:30,157
Yes,even Prashant has died,otheMrise
wouldn't he had come to you

190
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:32,492
So,has the God taken Prashant
with him?

191
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:34,161
Yes my child-

192
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:40,000
Think that, God has taken both
your Mother and Prashant with him

193
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:43,170
But Daddy was telling,that he
has been sent to India

194
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:47,674
No,my child,your Daddy was lying
so that you don't get a shock

195
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,513
Mummy,l am absolutely fine
in the School-

196
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,848
Mohan and Jim have become
my best friends-

197
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,351
But,l remember you,Daddy
and Jassu a lot

198
00:16:57,518 --> 00:17:01,563
When a plane goes across me,l feel
like sitting in it and reach MontReal

199
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,525
Even l'll become a pilot,when
l grow old,fly an Aeroplane-

200
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:07,194
So that,whenever l feel like
l'll reach Canada

201
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:09,863
Your son

202
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:18,372
Prashant,today aRer so many years
Daddy broke his silence-

203
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:20,374
l received his long
Ietter

204
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:24,044
And aRer reading it,my remembrances
as a child in MontReal became fresh-

205
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:27,548
Today,again,infront of my eyes,l am
able to see Jasbir moving,in the way-

206
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:28,882
Like that of 16
years ago

207
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,886
Because,it was wrong,that we
thought,that Jasbir is dead

208
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:36,390
Jasbir is alive,and she
is in Katmandu

209
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:39,893
l am departing to Katmandu
by the next flight-

210
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,896
And,l am also sending you a
ticket of Aeroplane-

211
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,232
Even you reach there,by the
next flight-

212
00:17:57,786 --> 00:17:59,580
The Valley is looking very beautiful
from the top-

213
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:00,414
How is this City
Katmandu?

214
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:02,916
Prashant,this is your first flight
towards Katmandu,isn't it

215
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,085
That's why,even l thought,l'll
make this a holiday trip

216
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:09,256
l have bid a Good bye to
Indian Airlines for a month

217
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:11,091
Captain Kapur is siting at the back
isn't it

218
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:11,425
Yes,Yes

219
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,760
He'll accompany you on your
way back to Delhi

220
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:15,429
Still there are no signals
of landing-

221
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:19,433
One AircraR has iust landed,and
another one is ready for a take off

222
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:22,769
Come on,let's have
some fun

223
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,147
Let's make the passengers,have a
Iook on the City,from the top

224
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,109
Look at that,it's the
Temple of Suyambu

225
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:39,786
Arey Masina,you are still
upstairs-

226
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:43,790
You were supposed to get a garland
made of flowers for the God from down

227
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,792
Mr.Shastri,coming

228
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:49,963
Oh Bother Toofan,Today l suppose
you are making a good money-

229
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:52,799
Don't forget on making some,as
an offering to God

230
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:57,137
The money of the disiples of God
If it doesn't go to the God himself-

231
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:58,305
Then,where else would
it go?

232
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,975
Yes folks,the plane has got disapeared
now turn your heads over here

233
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:06,688
This Suyambu is 2000 years old
add 20 years more to it-

234
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,650
That's because for the last 20 years
this servant of yours-

235
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:12,819
Has been regularly telling this to
their Tourist brothers and sisters

236
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:14,988
Look,lt looks like a
Tibbatian working centre

237
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:23,497
Arey,you people,haven't you
seen an Aeroplane before?-

238
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,999
Come on,everybody get in,get
on to your work,fast

239
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:36,176
Order

240
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:42,349
Shit

241
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:48,522
Shanti,How is the work
going on?

242
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:52,693
By your coming here,has the
sales of the people increased or not?

243
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:55,028
Drona sir,lt's iust
great

244
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:56,697
Yesterday the manager sir,
was telling-

245
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:59,867
That from the time,you have kept
Shanti,as a sales girl over here-

246
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:04,705
The foreign Tourists are coming to
the shop by three folds more

247
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:08,709
And,even l have started making
rounds over here,the every 3rd day

248
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:12,713
Drona sir,that's great,lnfact you
should be coming here daily

249
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:14,548
Why not,lt's all
yours-

250
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:18,385
Had you not seen this wonderful place
we wouldn't have got it-

251
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:20,554
To establish this centre
over here

252
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:23,056
Manager sir,your thought is
absolutely wonderful

253
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:25,559
We want only wonderful
things

254
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:29,563
Shanti,was Sathi right,that
we should be coming here daily?

255
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,733
Drona sir,not tomorrow,because
tomorrow its the festival of Bhaktpur-

256
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:36,904
And we both Shanti and Sathi along
with the people of our dance academy-

257
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:40,741
Have fully prepared for
the God's dance

258
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:43,911
ls there a crash
some where?

259
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:48,582
Look,How l have decorated
these dresses-

260
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,417
Anybody's heart would lure
for them

261
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,587
l am luring
come here

262
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:54,588
You come here

263
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:59,593
You said,that you'll
hike my salary

264
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:01,762
l promise,lt will
be hiked

265
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,599
Look outside,people have come
to buy Clothes

266
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:07,434
This is Soaltee

267
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:11,939
ls that Soaltee?

268
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,107
Yes,the most fashionable
Hotel of this place

269
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,281
lt's loaded with beautiful
white women

270
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,953
l referred about white women
and Prashant,you got lost

271
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:27,955
Chatteriee,ls your Daddy
alive?

272
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:31,124
You are landing at Katmandu
and thinking about Daddy

273
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,794
lt's been 3 years,that he
has expired

274
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:38,131
Very soon,the parents die,children
cry and forget them in a very short span-

275
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:43,804
And in the due course,the longing
for their remembrances decreases-

276
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,474
But when parents are alive and
still stay away from children-

277
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:49,142
And their remembrances trouble
their children-

278
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,310
And the children can not
meet them

279
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:54,022
Then probably,you can't estimate
what it feels like?

280
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,983
Your father is in Canada,
Isn't it?

281
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:59,152
Yes Canada
MontReal-

282
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:02,489
And we stayed in a Boarding School
of India,right from our childhood

283
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:06,493
ln the last 16 years,Daddy has
just written 3 letters to me

284
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:09,163
And in the last 12 years
just one

285
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:12,166
But suddenly,l got a letter
saying my son

286
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:13,834
l have learnt that you are
a pilot in an Airlines

287
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:15,502
You also must be going on a
flight to Katmandu-

288
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:17,838
lf not,then immidietly go
on a holiday to Katmandu-

289
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:19,173
And Inform me immidietly,as
soon as you reach there

290
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:21,675
The Soaltee Hotel of that place,
which is recently opened-

291
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:25,179
There's a Casino,the moment you
get down from that stairs

292
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:28,182
The moment you enter into a Disco
theque,which is on the right hand side-

293
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:29,850
May be you....

294
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:03,550
Why so soon,what about me,who is been
standing for such a long time

295
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:06,053
Meer,let me take some rest,
But first get me a drink-

296
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:08,388
One Beer,l am feeling
very Thirsty

297
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,224
One Beer

298
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:17,231
Now come,let me see how much you can
dance,l'll exhaust you completely

299
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:23,237
Did you get
hurt?

300
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:25,072
Wait,let me take
some more rest

301
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:30,577
First,give me my glasses,let
me see who you are?

302
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:38,085
Now,catch hold of
my hand

303
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:45,592
Do you like
this face?

304
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:47,427
A lot

305
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:49,388
What do you think,no one other
than you can wear them?

306
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:53,392
Even with these
glasses?

307
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:11,118
Jenis is a wonderful
girl-

308
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,120
From the time she has come
to Katmandu-

309
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:14,788
The glitter of this Disco
theque has got enhanced

310
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:16,290
What did you say her
name as?

311
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:24,464
One Brandy

312
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:37,644
One more

313
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,162
lf you are waiting here for Jenis
then immidietly push off

314
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,166
lt looks as if,you are the
only admirer of Jenis

315
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:03,337
lf you have doubts about it,then
throw it out from your heart

316
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:04,838
No,l have no
doubts

317
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:12,012
And don't be under a mis-understanding
by looking at her dancing in this way

318
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:14,515
Meer is my friend,and
Jenis knows about it-

319
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:17,518
And we all friends,share
each others things-

320
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:18,685
One Branddy

321
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:21,021
Since,when do you
know Jenis?

322
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,362
Jenis,l am waiting
out

323
00:25:35,077 --> 00:25:37,704
You went away,without even
answering to my question

324
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:41,041
lt's been how many days,since
you have come to Katmandu?

325
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,377
Still one day is
not over

326
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:46,380
And It's been 2 months since
Jenis has come here-

327
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:50,384
And l know her from the same
day on which she reached here-

328
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:54,888
And,lf anybody tries to come
between both of us,then....

329
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,392
Jenis come,lt's
getting late

330
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,062
Tell Dera to pour
another Beer-

331
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:02,896
We'll leave
aRer that

332
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:06,400
4 Beers and along with it
the bill

333
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:10,070
1 Beer for Jenis,and give me
the bill

334
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:13,240
lf sir wants to drink,he can
drink at leisure in that corner-

335
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:14,908
Let him not take trouble of
mixing with us

336
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:17,077
Deepak,you are blowing
hot and cold

337
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:20,247
Look,l want to offer you
all a Beer-

338
00:26:20,455 --> 00:26:22,082
And,your friend,all of a sudden
got angry

339
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:25,919
You are kicking away
a free offer

340
00:26:26,128 --> 00:26:27,087
Dera,get me
a Beer

341
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:29,756
Who amongst you will
have a Beer?

342
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:33,594
And for a change,don't give
the bill to Mr.Deepak-

343
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:35,095
Take it from
sir

344
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:56,116
Here,have another Brandy,and
this is your entire bill-

345
00:26:56,492 --> 00:26:57,951
4 Brandys and
12 Beers

346
00:27:01,497 --> 00:27:01,622
To the Bakery

347
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:09,129
Michele,here your commission
is completed

348
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:12,966
This time,even if you offer a little
more commission-

349
00:27:13,342 --> 00:27:15,302
l'll take it

350
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:18,639
Because,the previous Idols,which were
taken away from the Temple-

351
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:21,975
Had it not been smuggled in
todays flight-

352
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:23,477
Then you would have
definitely been caught

353
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:28,023
Michele,that's why l appreciate
you-

354
00:27:28,357 --> 00:27:31,985
Because l doubt,that the police
was having a little doubt on us

355
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:39,660
Till the time,these hippy people stay
in all the Houses of your area-

356
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:44,498
And till the time,by your grace
Michele runs a Bakery for them-

357
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:48,335
Till that time,neither the robber
can be unknown,nor the robbery

358
00:27:57,219 --> 00:27:58,679
They all must be at
the Bakery

359
00:27:58,887 --> 00:28:01,348
First,you would like to come
to my palace or to the Bakery?

360
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:03,183
Yes,let's go to
the Bakery

361
00:28:18,574 --> 00:28:24,037
Michele,they all were your people
they are all going towards Bakery

362
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:31,712
Well,your's as well as your friends
rent has still not reached-

363
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,049
Don't force me to give you a notice
of leaving this entire property

364
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:39,887
Drona sir,you'll get your rent
give us some more time,l'll tell everybody

365
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:46,453
Daddy,had written,that l'll find
Jasbir dancing is Soaltee-

366
00:29:46,662 --> 00:29:49,456
And l think,l iust now
met her-

367
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:52,626
But,why did everyone say her
name as Jenis?

368
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:56,296
And,Even l was also a
little sceptical

369
00:29:57,506 --> 00:30:01,134
Why don't l call Daddy
in MontReal

370
00:30:13,814 --> 00:30:15,315
Who Prashant?

371
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:18,318
l am calling up from Hotel Mansarovar
in Katmandu

372
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:21,321
Daddy,are you recognising
my voice?

373
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:25,325
Yes my son,How are you,
your voice...

374
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:28,996
You should have atleast sent
a recent photograph of Jassu-

375
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:31,665
lt would have made my work easy
in recognising her-

376
00:30:31,874 --> 00:30:34,001
So,Couldn't you
recognise her?

377
00:30:34,376 --> 00:30:36,503
How couldn't l,she is
my sister-

378
00:30:37,212 --> 00:30:40,174
But l want to ask you,that
aRer we came back to India-

379
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:42,509
Did she keep another
name for herself?

380
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:46,180
No,Oh yes may be she has
kept,out of fear-

381
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:49,183
She had taken money and ran away
about a year back-

382
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:52,352
And it's possible,that she is scared to
disclose her name out of the police fear

383
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:55,022
She had become quiet a rebel
before she ran away-

384
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:58,525
And for the last 1 year,we thought
that she,in an accident would have...

385
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:04,531
And listen,over there,there's
a very good friend of mine-

386
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,034
l have written to him also,
you definitely meet him-

387
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:09,369
Even l am trying to catch the
very next flight-

388
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:10,704
l'll telegram you,as soon as
it gets confirmed

389
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:17,044
Arey,leave,you'll go so far
to meet Jasbir at Katmandu-

390
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:19,046
She is not bothered,that she
has a Daddy

391
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:21,048
She is anyways absconding
for the last 1 year-

392
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:23,383
As though previously she used to
come,meet you,leaving her friends

393
00:31:23,592 --> 00:31:25,052
She was always in the last
when it came to studies-

394
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,553
And was always ahead,when it
came to brash behaviour

395
00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:28,555
Had my own daughter failed
like this-

396
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:30,057
l would have
squashed her

397
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:35,729
Where does this young crop
stay in Katmandu?

398
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:36,230
Who?

399
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,399
The same,who keep roaming
as Hippies?

400
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:43,403
Sir,sleep for now,meet them
tomorrow when the down arises-

401
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:48,408
You'll find all of them on roads
in Bazaars,on cross roads-

402
00:31:48,617 --> 00:31:51,245
But,make your start
from Suyambu

403
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:09,137
These people have been singing
from age old times

404
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:15,269
And today,spcially for you,
l have made them wait here

405
00:32:20,482 --> 00:32:21,942
Oh my Bothers
MOVe

406
00:32:23,485 --> 00:32:26,113
Your fate,has brought you to
the Temple to Suyambu-

407
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:30,117
Definitely a miracle will take place
remember my words,l am talking truth-

408
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:32,953
And Lama peopel stay
over here-

409
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:36,290
ln case you go astray in Nepal,
and to spend your night-

410
00:32:36,665 --> 00:32:38,458
You'll get a lot of peace under
the feet of Budha-

411
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:40,794
And Shanti is a fabulous
dancer of Katmandu

412
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:43,964
The moment she looks up at someone
he becomes mesmerised

413
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:47,134
And my name is Toofan
absolutely opposite of Shanti

414
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,637
And Toofan is the one,who can
make you reach till Shanti-

415
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:52,139
Give me a chance to
serve you-

416
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:54,641
Every Tourist of the world has taken
something or the other from Toofan

417
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:55,809
Only you
are leR-

418
00:32:56,143 --> 00:32:57,644
The moment l got up in the
morning,l heard God's voice-

419
00:32:57,811 --> 00:32:59,146
That a man from India
has come-

420
00:32:59,313 --> 00:33:02,024
You'll find him wandering,here
in Suyambu,definitely help him

421
00:33:04,526 --> 00:33:07,321
The one whom you are in search for,
she is not far from my sight

422
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:17,164
lf the ceremonial dot is put
on the forehead-

423
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:21,001
And if you concentrate on God,he
immidiately enters into your heart

424
00:33:26,715 --> 00:33:28,842
Why have you stopped,even l
am deviated from the path

425
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:35,682
When did you become Jenis
from Jasbeer?

426
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:37,851
What did you say?

427
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:40,354
Since,when have you changed
your name?

428
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:42,189
What name,
which name?

429
00:33:49,404 --> 00:33:51,865
lf everyone has put the ceremonial
dot,then come,it's getting late

430
00:33:55,744 --> 00:33:58,705
That man has started following me,
are you liking this?

431
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:04,044
lf you have to stay in Katmandu
here aRer don't follow Jenis

432
00:34:16,557 --> 00:34:18,392
Take the help of Toofan,your
entire journey will be a sucess-

433
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:20,227
OtheMrise,she is a girl,she'll put
you into such a trap-

434
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:22,396
That,all the followers of God
Pashupathi together can't...

435
00:34:22,563 --> 00:34:24,064
They all stay here,in the
same House

436
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:25,399
lt can be known
right away

437
00:34:25,774 --> 00:34:26,733
Ay! Masina

438
00:34:27,442 --> 00:34:28,235
Yes,Brother Toofan

439
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:29,570
Who had come up?

440
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:30,571
No one

441
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:33,240
Does any one else also stay here
or have you given the House on rent?

442
00:34:33,448 --> 00:34:36,243
No,How will Mr.Shastri,give
his House on rent?

443
00:34:45,294 --> 00:34:46,920
Where did those people go,
who just now came up?

444
00:34:47,296 --> 00:34:47,754
Which people?

445
00:34:48,297 --> 00:34:49,923
A few boys and girls had come
here,isn't it

446
00:34:50,299 --> 00:34:50,924
l don't remember

447
00:35:12,821 --> 00:35:13,447
What's your name?

448
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:15,616
Daily How much lie do
you speak?

449
00:35:15,824 --> 00:35:18,118
Sir,l stay in Temple,l haven't
spoken any lie till date

450
00:35:18,327 --> 00:35:19,953
Then,why didn't you give me
the true answer?

451
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:22,122
Sir,The matter is,that they
gave me 2 Rs-

452
00:35:22,498 --> 00:35:24,124
And asked me not to say it to
anyone,that we came here-

453
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:25,292
And,l told it
to you-

454
00:35:25,834 --> 00:35:29,129
And sir,more over,they are all my
friends,l sometims dine also with them

455
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:31,465
Sir,lt's a fact,that Masina
never speaks a lie

456
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,467
And he is known to my
small Brother-

457
00:35:33,675 --> 00:35:34,801
And there are no wear abouts
of his parents

458
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,971
Sir,he is lying,all the Gods and
Godesses of this Temple are my parents

459
00:35:38,347 --> 00:35:39,306
Sir,he is saying
the truth-

460
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,141
ln Katmandu,there is
a famous saying-

461
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:43,477
That,Masina has been thrown
by God,straight from the sky-

462
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:46,480
That's why everybody loves him,
and no one refutes to his talk

463
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:48,357
Masina,l felt happy aRer
meeting you

464
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:48,982
Sir,even l

469
00:35:55,864 --> 00:35:58,659
Alright tell me,where do these people
live,who just now went down?

470
00:35:58,867 --> 00:35:59,493
What do they do?

471
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:01,495
Sir,they are all,very
good people-

472
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,997
They never fight with anyone,
they all enjoy life-

473
00:36:04,206 --> 00:36:05,833
They sing,drink,sleep,roam
and eat-

474
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:08,502
They are all called as English
Hippy people in Katmandu-

475
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,003
l'll Introduce you
to them

476
00:36:10,379 --> 00:36:12,172
Look,how nice a person
Masina is...

But sir,don't try to bid a
price on me...

478
00:36:14,716 --> 00:36:16,343
Actually,l'll take you to that place
where those Hippies go

479
00:36:17,386 --> 00:36:19,346
Yes sir,on this you should
ask Toofan

480
00:36:19,555 --> 00:36:22,349
Todays,it's the Bhaktpur festival,the

481
00:36:22,516 --> 00:36:23,684
This,we'll spend it
on taxi-

482
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:27,521
And then,when you see Shanti,you'll

How did she become
a Hippy?

490
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:14,735
Arey,Who is this young man
standing between both of us?

You iust have a look at Shanti's

00:37:25,287 --> 00:37:26,747
Then,should l have hit
a sand particle?

495
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:28,415
You are ruining all
the fun

496
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,918
lf you want to have more fun
l'll give you one kick -

497
00:37:31,126 --> 00:37:33,253
And the gluing which is going on
through these binoculars -

498
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:35,255
You'll find the whole World
swinging within a second

499
00:37:35,631 --> 00:37:36,423
Col. Who is he?

500
00:37:36,632 --> 00:37:39,593
Boss,you don't get angry,our sir
is just joking with you -

501
00:37:39,801 --> 00:37:40,928
Look in the front,you can
do business

502
00:37:41,303 --> 00:37:42,596
Work,Work,Work
always work

503
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:50,938
Had the frock been liRed a little more
It would have been a different scene

504
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:53,649
l have tried enough,but...

505
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:02,449
Look,Look,...Look

506
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:06,286
You think yourself to be very clever
when it comes to girls

507
00:38:07,162 --> 00:38:09,456
lf you are feeling very restless
come on,go ahead and catch her hand -

508
00:38:09,706 --> 00:38:10,791
Let me also see,how much
courage you have?

509
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:14,711
lf l give one whistle,10 such girls
will come standing in front of me

510
00:38:15,504 --> 00:38:19,925
My name is Drona,l am surprised
till now,how did you not know it?

511
00:38:20,634 --> 00:38:23,303
l keep the entire city on the
point of my shoe

512
00:38:23,512 --> 00:38:25,013
The point of my shoe is
also no less -

513
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:29,476
lf Shanti,looks at you,her sight
will freeze on you -

514
00:38:29,768 --> 00:38:31,144
Her heart will throb
for you -

515
00:38:31,353 --> 00:38:34,857
And the wave that would rise,here
take,its the local intoxication drink -

516
00:38:35,023 --> 00:38:37,151
Have two sips with me,the sight
will have more colour -

517
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:38,485
And the dance will become
more colourful -

518
00:38:38,735 --> 00:38:39,653
Sir,take it,take

519
00:39:02,676 --> 00:39:04,845
Take it sir,don't refuse,its
your money -

520
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:07,181
lf she looks over here the lightening
will crackle more powerfully -

521
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:09,183
And the bottle will turn into pieces
once it falls from your hands

522
00:39:09,474 --> 00:39:10,851
Don't break the heart of
a poor Nepali -

523
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:13,103
The friendship will grow more
stronger by striking the bottles

524
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:17,733
Wow! Great!over here too
my dancing beauty

525
00:39:20,903 --> 00:39:25,282
Meet our sir Mr.Raia,he has
specially come to meet you

526
00:39:26,742 --> 00:39:29,953
Not Mr.Raia,people call him
King Indra -

527
00:39:30,454 --> 00:39:32,873
Who has come into the arena
to watch the dance -

528
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:34,875
Shanti,what are you looking
over there,look here -

529
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:36,793
l have brought so many
photographers for you

530
00:39:37,252 --> 00:39:39,463
Before you wink,there will be
1000 photographs clicked of yours

531
00:39:40,506 --> 00:39:44,551
Wonderful my dear,every heart throbs
for you,but mine throbs the most

532
00:39:46,094 --> 00:39:51,391
May be your pining breaks the glasses
of binoculars and the lense of your camera -

533
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:53,060
And the one who has to take her
takes her and flees off

534
00:39:55,103 --> 00:39:56,730
l don't have an excuse
of a Camera -

535
00:39:56,897 --> 00:39:59,107
But,l'll definitely go aRer making
your impression cast on me

536
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:03,403
Sir,what an answer,look
Shanti is enjoying,looking at you

537
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:06,573
Shanti,be careful before you
throw your arrow -

538
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:09,910
lnfact,its better if you stay
here itself

539
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:14,581
lf he loves you so much,then ask
him if he has the guts of coming infront

540
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,920
Sir,when the sight doesn't get settled
it turns and becomes shy

541
00:40:20,212 --> 00:40:23,257
And the attraction which will come
out from this person's heart -

542
00:40:23,465 --> 00:40:26,802
That will definitely penetrate through,
and make the hearts restless

543
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:36,061
Sir,don't leave it,you have won
Shanti's heart,she called you Kancha

544
00:40:36,353 --> 00:40:38,939
And Kancha in Nepali language
means ''Young Colourful Lover''

545
00:45:21,096 --> 00:45:23,140
Shanti,where are you going atleast
go aRer meeting my photographer friends

546
00:45:23,891 --> 00:45:25,142
They have all come from
Europe and America -

547
00:45:25,434 --> 00:45:28,353
To cover all the important and special
events of Katmandu in their magazines

548
00:45:28,562 --> 00:45:30,898
l told them,who can be a more
eminent personality than Shanti -

549
00:45:31,106 --> 00:45:32,941
ln the entire city,especially on
the occassion of this festival -

550
00:45:33,108 --> 00:45:35,903
Just the greetings won't do,you'll
have to come in the night -

551
00:45:36,111 --> 00:45:36,737
l have called all of them
to the casino -

552
00:45:36,945 --> 00:45:37,905
They'll take your
interview too

553
00:45:57,299 --> 00:46:01,386
Drona sir,my name is Prashanth
Forgive me,if l have exceeded my limits

554
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,138
l am quiet a low
headed person -

555
00:46:03,347 --> 00:46:08,268
But you,this local drink and
Shanti incited me a little bit

556
00:46:09,811 --> 00:46:10,270
Greetings

557
00:46:18,529 --> 00:46:20,155
What was the necessity of throwing
the garland at him?

558
00:46:20,531 --> 00:46:22,783
Didn't you like,that he made
Drona bite the dust -

559
00:46:22,991 --> 00:46:24,243
Didn't allow him to hang
around near that girl

560
00:46:24,535 --> 00:46:26,829
And now,if he again comes back
to enquire about you,then?

561
00:46:27,538 --> 00:46:28,622
Listen

562
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:32,793
Had l leR away,without saying
a word of thanks for the garland -

563
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:33,961
lt would have been my
impertinence

564
00:46:34,336 --> 00:46:36,964
lnfact,in the morning,you were about to
put the ceremonial dot,but you stopped -

565
00:46:37,548 --> 00:46:38,298
l didn't like that

566
00:46:38,674 --> 00:46:39,842
Now,there's iust one
thing lacking -

567
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:42,636
And if l put the ceremonial
dot on your forehead -

568
00:46:42,845 --> 00:46:43,971
Put it and
See -

569
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,849
lt's been ages,that any one has put the
ceremonial dot on this forehead

570
00:46:55,524 --> 00:46:55,858
You all come here

571
00:47:41,361 --> 00:47:43,572
Remove these glasses,it doesn't
Iook good,it spoils the face -

572
00:47:43,864 --> 00:47:44,698
Look how this is spoiling
my face

573
00:47:45,324 --> 00:47:47,576
No,infact it looks better
Iook -

574
00:47:47,826 --> 00:47:48,702
Don't l look more
handsome?

575
00:47:50,287 --> 00:47:51,705
Jenis,l hate you

576
00:47:52,414 --> 00:47:54,249
Where did l hear this word
''Hate'' from?

577
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:55,584
Deepak,you

578
00:47:58,212 --> 00:47:59,713
Everyone,throw Deepak out
from our boundary -

579
00:48:00,088 --> 00:48:01,924
There is no place for a person in our
group who believes in hatred

580
00:48:02,591 --> 00:48:05,052
Okay,then go,bye-bye to you
and to your group

581
00:48:06,261 --> 00:48:11,266
And take this,take,take more
drink and abuse me -

582
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,560
And go die with him and don't
come back -

583
00:48:13,894 --> 00:48:14,728
And let me also see,how long
does he stay with you? -

584
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:17,564
lt's been more than 2 months,that
l have wandered with you like a dog

585
00:48:17,815 --> 00:48:19,274
Ask Meer,Greg
and John -

586
00:48:19,566 --> 00:48:21,068
l have quarrelled with my
father for you

587
00:48:21,276 --> 00:48:25,030
And you,if you also want to associate
your name among these Martyrs -

588
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:25,697
Then,take her along
with you -

589
00:48:25,989 --> 00:48:28,033
One more dog will be seen
wagging his tail

590
00:48:35,374 --> 00:48:38,418
Whom did you call a dog
Do you know who l am?

591
00:48:38,961 --> 00:48:41,213
And that Jenis,
come here

592
00:48:46,468 --> 00:48:47,469
Jenis,will you go
with him?

593
00:49:06,697 --> 00:49:09,449
lf you think,that you can come
in between our unity -

594
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,785
Then,every time,you'll get
insulted like this

595
00:49:21,253 --> 00:49:22,671
Come on,Go,do
your work

596
00:49:27,843 --> 00:49:28,802
Getting too hot
is not good -

597
00:49:29,428 --> 00:49:31,680
Share a little brandy with us
you'll get relief

598
00:49:33,348 --> 00:49:34,975
Drona sir,don't offer me
the Brandy

599
00:49:35,434 --> 00:49:37,477
lt wouldn't be good for you,if
the fire rages more

600
00:49:37,978 --> 00:49:39,396
You are getting angry on such
a small matter -

601
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:43,025
You can find such insects creeping
all around Katmandu -

602
00:49:43,525 --> 00:49:46,153
Let this be between us,l can
take her whenever l feel like

603
00:49:49,198 --> 00:49:51,116
Arey,Why are you insulting
my guest?

604
00:50:05,672 --> 00:50:08,717
All this wouldn't have happened; Had
you not come here following that hippy girl

605
00:50:11,887 --> 00:50:15,390
There is blood on your face,
wipe it off

606
00:50:18,727 --> 00:50:20,854
Or else,take back your garland
which you made me wear

607
00:50:24,233 --> 00:50:26,693
Sir,the battle field can be won
only aRer sheding the blood -

608
00:50:26,902 --> 00:50:29,029
Come,let's have another drink
COMe,COMe

609
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:35,869
Arey Toofan,Masina,someone
has robbed my wallet

610
00:50:37,371 --> 00:50:39,373
Nothing can be known in such a big
crowd,may be its fallen somewhere

611
00:50:39,581 --> 00:50:40,457
Sir,how much money was
there in it?

612
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:42,459
Whatever,l had brought to Nepal
everything was in it -

613
00:50:43,126 --> 00:50:44,336
Did a mistake,l should have
IeR it in the hotel

614
00:50:44,795 --> 00:50:46,213
Sir,if your wallet has fallen somewhere
then,you'll definitely get it -

615
00:50:46,463 --> 00:50:47,548
There is no one in Nepal
who robs

616
00:50:47,756 --> 00:50:50,551
A wallet loaded with money
has fallen somewhere -

617
00:50:50,843 --> 00:50:53,887
lf anyone has seen please
give it back,please give it

618
00:50:55,305 --> 00:50:58,767
Sir,l have 5 rupees which l had saved;
if this can solve your purpose...

619
00:50:59,184 --> 00:51:00,561
And the money which l had
it was yours -

620
00:51:00,769 --> 00:51:02,062
lt became as drink and went
into my stomach

621
00:51:02,312 --> 00:51:06,942
Sir,there's a way,if God showers his
grace on us,let's go to the Casino in evening -

622
00:51:07,109 --> 00:51:08,777
May be this 5 rupees of Masina
proves to be lucky -

623
00:51:09,027 --> 00:51:09,903
Yes sir,this is
also possible

624
00:51:10,237 --> 00:51:12,072
You both are very innocent,if one
has only 5 rupees with him -

625
00:51:12,281 --> 00:51:13,574
Even gambling doesn't
favour

626
00:51:14,158 --> 00:51:15,367
Sir,come with me

627
00:51:15,576 --> 00:51:16,076
Where?

628
00:51:16,285 --> 00:51:17,578
Don't question
just come

629
00:51:17,828 --> 00:51:19,246
Come,Come
Come,Come

630
00:51:23,834 --> 00:51:25,919
Look at that,he is
our God

631
00:51:28,422 --> 00:51:29,923
Sir,once l cried
cried a lot -

632
00:51:30,424 --> 00:51:33,802
God caioled me and said,Masina
my son,never shed your tears -

633
00:51:34,219 --> 00:51:36,263
You will never lack anything
in life

634
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:39,516
And sir since then,the entire
city looks to be mine -

635
00:51:39,766 --> 00:51:40,601
Someone calls me son,and
someone calls me brother

636
00:51:40,809 --> 00:51:41,602
Sir,he is right

637
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:44,104
Sir,l'll go and have
a word with God -

638
00:51:44,354 --> 00:51:45,606
So that,in the evening you
play in a Casino -

639
00:51:45,814 --> 00:51:48,233
May be the money that you
have lost is back in your pocket

640
00:51:48,525 --> 00:51:51,153
But Masina,to stake,5 rupees
is nothing -

641
00:51:51,528 --> 00:51:53,822
The money that we win,will be in
accordance to the money that we stake

642
00:51:54,072 --> 00:51:57,284
Sir,l have spoken with God,and
to fulfil that,is my job

643
00:52:00,245 --> 00:52:02,831
Aunty,l need some
money

644
00:52:03,332 --> 00:52:04,625
Then,why are you standing
down,come up

645
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,629
Look Masina my child,l only
have 10 rupees with me -

646
00:52:08,879 --> 00:52:10,380
lf this can solve your purpose
then take it

647
00:52:12,341 --> 00:52:14,968
l need some money,
come with me

648
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:32,736
Now tell

649
00:52:42,037 --> 00:52:44,122
lts 3,didn't l say that its
the money touched by God

650
00:52:44,915 --> 00:52:47,084
Who allowed a small boy like
you to enter into the casino?

651
00:52:47,584 --> 00:52:48,669
lts prohibited for
children

652
00:52:48,961 --> 00:52:51,839
Sir is my friend and l have
come here aRer God's blessings

653
00:52:52,297 --> 00:52:54,466
You play gambling by keeping
a child besides you

654
00:52:55,217 --> 00:52:57,344
Your talent will be known only
if you play with a player

655
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:04,852
Sir,iust play one
more time

656
00:53:05,853 --> 00:53:06,812
Masina is right

657
00:53:07,312 --> 00:53:09,690
Even God has not permitted me
to play more than 3 times

658
00:53:11,191 --> 00:53:14,194
Throw it in the same way,as
you threw it earlier

659
00:53:38,802 --> 00:53:39,303
One Beer

660
00:53:42,347 --> 00:53:43,640
Why are you making children develop
the habit of beer?

661
00:53:45,934 --> 00:53:47,895
lf your lips are drying
then take this

662
00:53:50,689 --> 00:53:53,233
Play like a sport,what's this,all
the four have attacked on him

663
00:53:53,984 --> 00:53:56,069
Then,l'll myself settle my
accounts with him

664
00:55:03,178 --> 00:55:06,056
So that,the wounds of yours
don't become septic

665
00:55:15,149 --> 00:55:17,693
Masina,carry them and distribute
half from this,among yourselves

666
00:55:18,068 --> 00:55:19,820
Mr.Drona,there is no fault
of mine in this

667
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:31,498
Your handkerchief

668
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:33,500
Keep it with you

669
00:55:34,084 --> 00:55:35,752
May be,Mr.Drona will be wanting
to ask you

670
00:55:36,003 --> 00:55:40,841
Mr.Drona has his own,of silk he'll
take that one out

671
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:43,177
What are you people doing here
go away from here

672
00:55:44,386 --> 00:55:45,846
Go and follow him and see
where he goes

673
00:55:54,021 --> 00:55:55,856
Neither you know to lose nor
do you know to get defeated -

674
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:58,484
This is the biggest fault
in big people -

675
00:55:58,775 --> 00:55:59,860
And above that,you spoke
a lie -

676
00:56:00,444 --> 00:56:03,071
Under the deception,saying that
journalists from all over the World will come -

677
00:56:03,655 --> 00:56:05,866
There's a feast,they'll take your
interview,you must definitely come -

678
00:56:06,241 --> 00:56:07,659
Where are those
people of yours?

679
00:56:09,036 --> 00:56:12,998
ARer your father's death,l brought
you and your mother from Banaras -

680
00:56:13,207 --> 00:56:14,875
And gave the support,and
is this the regard for it?

681
00:56:16,126 --> 00:56:19,213
l got you a iob,saved you from
shame,is this the regard for it?

682
00:56:20,047 --> 00:56:21,215
The people who shower mercy
don't show it

683
00:56:22,716 --> 00:56:25,886
Not mercy,but l want to
shower my love on you -

684
00:56:27,262 --> 00:56:31,391
l have everything,no one refuses
if l give a hint

685
00:56:31,642 --> 00:56:35,813
Had love been a bargain,then
probably l would have told a yes -

686
00:56:36,563 --> 00:56:38,607
But l regret,it cannot
be bought

687
00:56:39,817 --> 00:56:42,069
You have completely finished
Drona's chance -

688
00:56:42,611 --> 00:56:46,114
Take Shanti along with you,the
entire Nepal will watch gazing

689
00:56:47,491 --> 00:56:49,785
l am wasting my time for the last
1 year,couldn't even hold her hand

690
00:56:50,035 --> 00:56:51,662
What are you blabbering
about Shanti?

691
00:56:52,162 --> 00:56:54,122
Arey,What are you doing
hitting a child

692
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:57,042
l am watching your movements
since morning -

693
00:56:57,459 --> 00:56:59,253
ls this the only way leR
to empty sir's pocket

694
00:56:59,878 --> 00:57:02,589
lf sir's intention has gone wrong
then take him to some shady joint -

695
00:57:03,173 --> 00:57:05,926
Don't ever take Shanti's name
infront of him

696
00:57:06,802 --> 00:57:08,262
Sir,Shanti is not a
characterless girl -

697
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:12,599
lf by chance,he has put a wrong
notion of hers to you -

698
00:57:12,808 --> 00:57:13,642
Then,throw
it out

699
00:57:13,892 --> 00:57:16,186
Just ask Shanti also,as to
what she wants -

700
00:57:16,812 --> 00:57:18,772
Don't you all have any other iob
other than Shanti

701
00:57:19,273 --> 00:57:22,484
That Drona sir,has an eyebrow of
his being rich,of being a boss

702
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:24,945
And here,Sathi whom l
joined for the dance -

703
00:57:25,154 --> 00:57:26,280
He keeps showing his right
On Me

704
00:57:27,197 --> 00:57:29,950
And you,l am watching you
vagabond from months -

705
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:32,619
By taking Shanti's name you are more
worried about increasing the tourist rates

706
00:57:33,662 --> 00:57:38,167
You don't listen to anybody
Do whatever you feel like

707
00:57:40,335 --> 00:57:42,629
Why brother,did you listen to
what Shanti said

708
00:57:47,259 --> 00:57:49,636
l never saw that this had some
cash in it,l thought it to be empty

709
00:57:51,263 --> 00:57:54,308
Wow! This has Mr.Drona's rent
of everybody

710
00:58:03,233 --> 00:58:05,611
Last night,l felt very bad,aRer
hearing from that wicked Drona -

711
00:58:05,777 --> 00:58:07,196
That,if the rent is not paid
within a week -

712
00:58:07,446 --> 00:58:09,823
He'll throw us out from
the bakery

713
00:58:10,324 --> 00:58:14,995
This aRernoon when l prayed,
God showered me with money

714
00:58:15,787 --> 00:58:21,084
Everybody's rent has been collected
and kept in this -

715
00:58:21,919 --> 00:58:24,838
That's why Deepak,if anybody tries to
borrow money in the excuse of rent -

716
00:58:25,047 --> 00:58:26,215
Then,plainly refuse

717
00:58:27,174 --> 00:58:31,011
And Dera,today whatever edible stuff is
there bring it and keep it in the front -

718
00:58:31,303 --> 00:58:33,013
Today,they'll eat
so much -

719
00:58:33,222 --> 00:58:36,016
That for the next 1 year,they'll
not feel the necessity of eating

720
01:05:04,988 --> 01:05:06,365
What are our people
doing? -

721
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:12,079
l told them to squash him,these idiots
are watching drama,aRer getting intoxicated

722
01:05:12,329 --> 01:05:13,914
They even couldn't have a proper
aim of the bottle -

723
01:05:14,122 --> 01:05:15,916
lf we don't leave soon from here
there is a risk of the Police coming -

724
01:05:16,124 --> 01:05:19,002
l iust now saw Inspector
Thapa coming

725
01:05:21,463 --> 01:05:23,423
Who,lnspector Thapa
Tell me?

726
01:05:24,132 --> 01:05:26,176
Sir,there is a big turbulence going
on here amongst the hippies -

727
01:05:26,343 --> 01:05:27,261
l need your orders

728
01:05:27,469 --> 01:05:28,679
What's the necessity in
asking for it?

729
01:05:29,638 --> 01:05:31,765
Sir,even your son Mr.Meer
is indulged in this

730
01:05:31,974 --> 01:05:34,351
What,even Meer is
among them?

731
01:06:13,974 --> 01:06:14,725
There is blood on
your face

732
01:06:14,975 --> 01:06:16,393
Even on your face...

733
01:06:51,136 --> 01:06:54,515
lf this doesn't stop in a second
l'll give the orders for firing

734
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:55,849
My daddy

735
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,645
From the time you all have come to
Katmandu,you have spoiled the city

736
01:07:00,062 --> 01:07:02,105
Come on get lost from here,
and go to your dens -

737
01:07:02,731 --> 01:07:06,235
And,tomorrow morning everybody's
Visa will be snatched -

738
01:07:06,443 --> 01:07:07,861
And your entry will be restricted
in coming into this city

739
01:07:08,779 --> 01:07:10,197
Deepak,Daddy will hold
you responsible

740
01:07:12,533 --> 01:07:16,537
Who,Deepak,come out,put
him into my car -

741
01:07:17,704 --> 01:07:21,542
l'll ask your daddy that he'll prefer
you see arrested in a jail or in house

742
01:07:22,584 --> 01:07:25,212
Come on get out from here,take them
out,put them into the police van

743
01:07:25,712 --> 01:07:27,756
Come,Come everybody
come out

744
01:07:27,965 --> 01:07:29,424
No daddy,l iust came
here and sat

745
01:07:42,771 --> 01:07:44,398
Oh! What do you think,can
you escape by hiding -

746
01:07:46,108 --> 01:07:47,734
First and foremost,put him
into the jail

747
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:51,738
lf you want to sit like this
among these hippies -

748
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:53,574
Then,dare you enter into
the house -

749
01:07:53,824 --> 01:08:00,414
Come,otheMrise,l'll tear your
skin apart with a belt,come out

750
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:29,485
lf you lock them into the iail,even
the jail will start rottening

751
01:08:30,277 --> 01:08:31,487
Leave them by giving
a warning -

752
01:08:31,778 --> 01:08:35,157
And tell them,if they again create
turbulence,the police will not spare them

753
01:08:39,995 --> 01:08:43,624
Go,everybody can go,consider this
to be your last warning

754
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:26,792
Why are you repeatedly
following me?

755
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,502
lf the answer for my question
is given -

756
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:30,337
l'll try not coming back
of you forever

757
01:09:30,546 --> 01:09:31,255
Quickly ask me

758
01:09:31,922 --> 01:09:32,881
You came here leaving
Canada

759
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:33,465
What?

760
01:09:34,842 --> 01:09:36,343
ls your name not
Jasbir Jaiswal?

761
01:09:36,885 --> 01:09:38,345
Didn't l tell you
its not

762
01:09:38,554 --> 01:09:39,513
ls your father not
Jaiswal?

763
01:09:39,721 --> 01:09:40,514
Don't take his name

764
01:09:40,722 --> 01:09:41,473
ls your mother's name
not Diya?

765
01:09:41,723 --> 01:09:45,936
My mother has died and even
my father,now you go from here

766
01:09:47,312 --> 01:09:48,355
Leave me

767
01:09:48,522 --> 01:09:50,691
You trust me,are you remembering
anything?

768
01:09:52,067 --> 01:09:54,862
Let me live,l want to live my life
l want to be alive

769
01:09:56,363 --> 01:09:58,365
Jasbir has died
Iong ago

770
01:10:14,298 --> 01:10:19,720
Mr.Upadhya,your son Mr.Deepak
is under my custody -

771
01:10:19,928 --> 01:10:24,516
Even if you come and give his bail
l have no intentions of releasing him

772
01:10:24,725 --> 01:10:27,186
And neither,l have any
intention of giving his bail -

773
01:10:27,603 --> 01:10:31,565
lt would be better,if you chain him
and lock him up for the entire life -

774
01:10:31,732 --> 01:10:33,942
They have spread nudity in
the entire city

775
01:10:34,193 --> 01:10:37,905
Mr.l.G.P,l am myself sick and tired
of his brash and irresponsible behaviour

776
01:10:38,197 --> 01:10:39,239
Here,take it and listen for
your ownself -

777
01:10:39,448 --> 01:10:41,617
Even your daddy holds the
same opinion as l hold -

778
01:10:41,992 --> 01:10:45,954
Aren't you ashamed,this long beard
Iong hair,lice in the head -

779
01:10:46,205 --> 01:10:48,081
The thick layers of dirt which is
deposited on your body -

780
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:51,710
l don't understand the meaning of
you people joining with those hooligans

781
01:10:52,252 --> 01:10:55,088
Daddy you are wrong,neither
they are bad nor hooligans

782
01:10:55,672 --> 01:10:58,091
Then,who are those people are
they Prophets of today's era?

783
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:00,886
Uncle,your thoughts have
become old

784
01:11:01,261 --> 01:11:03,430
And Daddy,don't forget,there is
one big gap between us

785
01:11:03,639 --> 01:11:08,435
There is a generation gap between us
and our principles...

786
01:11:08,769 --> 01:11:09,478
Stop blabbering

787
01:11:10,729 --> 01:11:15,108
The only gap which is between us
is that l'll give you one slap-

788
01:11:15,359 --> 01:11:17,986
And all your principles of which you
blow a lot of trumpet -

789
01:11:18,278 --> 01:11:19,947
Would be thrown out and
will disappear

790
01:11:20,697 --> 01:11:23,992
Go see your face in the mirror,your
appearance looks like that of a monkey

791
01:11:27,496 --> 01:11:28,539
You are playing the Guitar?

792
01:11:29,164 --> 01:11:30,123
You must be upset

793
01:11:30,332 --> 01:11:30,749
Where were you?

794
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:33,252
l was preparing a Smoke
for you

795
01:11:34,044 --> 01:11:35,379
l knew you must be craving
for it

796
01:11:35,546 --> 01:11:37,589
And l have collected
everybody's rent

797
01:11:37,756 --> 01:11:39,132
Next time,if Mr. Drona
ask's for it-

798
01:11:39,341 --> 01:11:40,175
l'll throw them on
his face

799
01:11:57,651 --> 01:11:59,820
l had told you that l'll be
Iate in the night

800
01:12:00,195 --> 01:12:01,822
l shall lock the door from
outside 8 go

801
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:04,158
So that your sleep is not disturbed
when l return

802
01:12:04,408 --> 01:12:07,494
lf you return so late in the night
can l sleep?

803
01:12:08,662 --> 01:12:10,122
You should not worry about
me mother

804
01:12:10,414 --> 01:12:11,623
Because Shanti is your
daughter -

805
01:12:11,790 --> 01:12:13,917
And she knows how to take care
of herself

806
01:12:14,459 --> 01:12:16,253
You go to sleep,l'll change
my dress

807
01:12:35,814 --> 01:12:37,024
How can l stop worrying
about you?

808
01:12:37,274 --> 01:12:39,902
You have returned so late 8 you
are going out again

809
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:42,488
What's going on,tell me
everything truthfully

810
01:12:43,906 --> 01:12:45,491
l'll tell you everything
truthfully,mother

811
01:12:45,908 --> 01:12:47,201
Have faith on your
daughter

812
01:12:52,831 --> 01:12:54,208
lf we spend the
night here

813
01:12:54,458 --> 01:12:56,210
God won't be offended

814
01:12:56,502 --> 01:12:57,419
Why should he be
offended?

815
01:12:57,628 --> 01:12:59,546
There are thousands 8 lakhs
of houses here

816
01:13:00,172 --> 01:13:01,798
Will God not be pained
aRer knowing

817
01:13:02,049 --> 01:13:04,343
That not a single person offered
you shelter for the night

818
01:13:06,261 --> 01:13:08,138
l have come to fetch you
l'll take you home

819
01:13:09,389 --> 01:13:10,224
Where is your house?

820
01:13:10,724 --> 01:13:12,226
Right here,infront

821
01:13:12,851 --> 01:13:13,811
Who all are there
in the house?

822
01:13:14,102 --> 01:13:14,394
My mother

823
01:13:15,103 --> 01:13:15,395
Besides her

824
01:13:16,104 --> 01:13:17,064
Besides her,me

825
01:13:17,856 --> 01:13:18,482
And

826
01:13:19,399 --> 01:13:19,942
And God

827
01:13:20,108 --> 01:13:22,778
God is here also,and there
is Peace also here

828
01:13:22,945 --> 01:13:26,240
And let your mother sleep
in Peace

829
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:29,409
And the three of us spend the night
here at the feet of God

830
01:13:30,077 --> 01:13:32,454
Sir to spend the night my house
is also there

831
01:13:32,704 --> 01:13:35,249
ARer both of you feel tired of
talking,come over

832
01:13:36,416 --> 01:13:38,585
ln the other room Mr.Shastri
sleeps soundly

833
01:13:38,877 --> 01:13:40,045
He'll not know

834
01:13:48,303 --> 01:13:49,721
Have you seen your
face Shanti?

835
01:13:50,889 --> 01:13:52,141
And have you seen
yours?

836
01:13:53,809 --> 01:13:54,977
lt's partly seen

837
01:13:58,105 --> 01:13:59,731
l am a Simple Girl
of Nepal

838
01:14:00,774 --> 01:14:03,318
But perhaps you like hippy
girls better

839
01:14:04,111 --> 01:14:06,280
Wearing Jazzy clothes

840
01:14:07,114 --> 01:14:09,116
How did you know my
preference so soon?

841
01:14:09,992 --> 01:14:12,286
l can also dress
like them

842
01:14:14,538 --> 01:14:16,165
Tell me truthfully what's on
your mind?

843
01:14:17,791 --> 01:14:19,501
Why do you iump in the fire
frequently?

844
01:14:21,128 --> 01:14:24,173
Perhaps l have come to Katmandu
to jump in the fire

845
01:14:24,798 --> 01:14:26,216
That girl has tortured you
a lot

846
01:14:27,134 --> 01:14:27,509
Which girl?

847
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:29,678
l was watching
everything

848
01:14:31,597 --> 01:14:32,347
Do l look unhappy,
Shanti

849
01:14:32,931 --> 01:14:33,515
Very much

850
01:14:34,349 --> 01:14:35,809
You should be a keen
observer to know

851
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:37,644
You are also
unhappy

852
01:14:38,145 --> 01:14:39,146
That's why l
have come

853
01:14:40,189 --> 01:14:40,689
For what?

854
01:14:41,315 --> 01:14:43,317
Perhaps by sharing the unhappiness
of each other -

855
01:14:43,525 --> 01:14:44,818
We may get some
happiness

856
01:14:47,321 --> 01:14:49,823
You have many admirers Shanti,why
should you be unhappy?

857
01:14:50,657 --> 01:14:53,535
Suddenly if you start
liking somebody

858
01:14:53,952 --> 01:14:55,787
Should one feel ashamed to tell
the truth?

859
01:14:56,121 --> 01:14:58,123
lt will be really not a matter
of shame

860
01:15:05,047 --> 01:15:06,465
Are you seeing,Mr.Drona

861
01:15:07,382 --> 01:15:10,010
l have never been hurt so much
before as l am hurt today

862
01:15:12,888 --> 01:15:15,349
Shanti,l don't know whether,l am
right or not

863
01:15:15,557 --> 01:15:15,808
Why?

864
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:19,853
Because the purpose for which l
have come here,should not be lost

865
01:15:20,979 --> 01:15:22,689
Suppose l get involved with you
and go astray

866
01:15:22,856 --> 01:15:23,857
Go ahead,l may be
of some help

867
01:15:24,107 --> 01:15:25,859
No,you wouldn't be able
to do anything

868
01:15:26,944 --> 01:15:28,695
l can't tell you anything,l can't
tell anybody anything

869
01:15:28,904 --> 01:15:29,196
What?

870
01:15:29,947 --> 01:15:30,322
Nothing

871
01:15:31,698 --> 01:15:33,033
Don't ask me anything now

872
01:15:33,283 --> 01:15:34,785
l wouldn't ask
neVef

873
01:15:35,744 --> 01:15:38,664
Because l am absolutely sure that
you will do the right thing only

874
01:15:39,414 --> 01:15:40,999
And God will be
with you

875
01:15:45,754 --> 01:15:47,381
ldol is of Gold

876
01:15:48,465 --> 01:15:49,716
Michele was saying

877
01:15:50,592 --> 01:15:55,055
ln America it will be worth
50,OOO dollars

878
01:15:55,264 --> 01:15:57,432
Meaning it won't be worth
Iess than 5-6 lakhs of rupees

879
01:15:57,683 --> 01:15:58,517
When shall we take it?

880
01:15:59,017 --> 01:16:03,897
No other night will be better
than tonight to take it

881
01:16:05,399 --> 01:16:06,900
Once the idol is taken away
from here

882
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:13,949
For all our other theRs those
Iovers will be blamed

883
01:16:20,914 --> 01:16:22,082
Has Mr.Shastri slept?

884
01:16:22,332 --> 01:16:23,083
Who is Masina?

885
01:16:23,458 --> 01:16:25,252
Oh Mr.Drona,so late
in the night...

886
01:16:26,003 --> 01:16:27,921
Night is not over yet
Mr.Shastri -

887
01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:32,092
This is the time for devotees to talk
to God who is in heaven

888
01:16:32,301 --> 01:16:34,219
l iust came from devotional singing
8 l remembered -

889
01:16:34,636 --> 01:16:39,308
That l should tell you that a
cheque is ready for the Temple

890
01:16:39,475 --> 01:16:41,310
l will send it through Sathi
in the morning,please take it

891
01:16:41,768 --> 01:16:43,020
Thank you Mr.Drona

892
01:16:43,437 --> 01:16:45,439
May God give you a
Iong life

893
01:16:45,647 --> 01:16:47,608
And you get more
blessings

894
01:16:48,192 --> 01:16:50,652
Your blessings are needed
Mr.Shastri

895
01:16:51,612 --> 01:16:53,113
Mr.Shastri he is the
same tourist -

896
01:16:53,655 --> 01:16:55,782
Who had been quarrelling with
people the whole day

897
01:16:56,366 --> 01:17:01,580
But what is he doing at this time
of the night in the Temple with Shanti

898
01:17:02,289 --> 01:17:07,127
What obiections can we have when
Mr.Shastri is here?

899
01:17:07,377 --> 01:17:08,879
Okay Mr.Shastri
greetings

900
01:17:09,171 --> 01:17:11,131
Forgive me if l have made
any mistake

901
01:17:14,676 --> 01:17:15,594
Mother also says the
same thing

902
01:17:16,178 --> 01:17:18,472
That Guests are considered
as Gods in Nepal

903
01:17:19,014 --> 01:17:21,809
lf you come with me to my house
mother will also feel happy

904
01:17:22,017 --> 01:17:23,268
But what'll your
mother think?

905
01:17:23,685 --> 01:17:25,813
Who is he,where has he come
from,What has he come for?

906
01:17:26,355 --> 01:17:27,981
He is unnecessarily claiming a
right over my daughter

907
01:17:28,357 --> 01:17:31,193
Suppose l give you that right
just now,then?

908
01:17:49,336 --> 01:17:50,295
l'll wait

909
01:18:57,613 --> 01:18:59,448
Golden Idol of God
is missing

910
01:19:07,539 --> 01:19:09,541
Who is the one,who is
stealing the idols?

911
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:11,251
lt has happened 5 times
earlier also

912
01:19:11,502 --> 01:19:13,921
Last week,it was on the
papers headlines

913
01:19:15,339 --> 01:19:16,590
Yes l also read it

914
01:19:17,633 --> 01:19:18,509
TheR in the temple!!

915
01:19:19,301 --> 01:19:21,762
ln the last 4 months,this is
the 6th theR in our temple -

916
01:19:21,804 --> 01:19:23,263
And the entire Police Department
is sleeping

917
01:19:23,806 --> 01:19:24,807
Take out all
those files

918
01:19:25,224 --> 01:19:27,184
Which relate to the
previous theRs

919
01:19:27,810 --> 01:19:29,937
And the names of those people who
are our suspects

920
01:19:30,479 --> 01:19:32,064
l will investigate this
case myself

921
01:19:36,735 --> 01:19:39,154
Previous theRs are going to be
investigated throughly

922
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:42,908
lnform Michele that the Idol
should not remain with him

923
01:19:43,784 --> 01:19:46,787
Till the idol is sent
out of the Country

924
01:19:47,538 --> 01:19:49,414
He should hide the Idol
somewhere quickly

925
01:19:50,332 --> 01:19:53,293
Listen,what happened to
Suyambu's cheque?

926
01:19:53,544 --> 01:19:54,127
l am going there only

927
01:19:55,546 --> 01:19:58,173
Mr.Shastri,Mr.Shastri
where are you?

928
01:19:58,549 --> 01:20:00,509
Mr.Shastri what's happening in
our temples everyday?

929
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:03,846
l have brought Mr.Drona's cheque
for the temple

930
01:20:04,054 --> 01:20:06,014
And find that God's Idol
is missing

931
01:20:06,515 --> 01:20:09,226
Masina who was there aRer
we leR last night

932
01:20:09,518 --> 01:20:11,687
There the devotional songs
were over and here

933
01:20:11,979 --> 01:20:15,983
Forget it,so many Tourists
are roaming here

934
01:20:16,275 --> 01:20:17,025
Yes yes go ahead

935
01:20:18,694 --> 01:20:20,529
lt's like blaming
Shanti

936
01:20:20,779 --> 01:20:22,156
lf you have doubt
on somebody

937
01:20:22,322 --> 01:20:24,199
Then it is your duty
to tell his name

938
01:20:24,449 --> 01:20:26,285
Masina what's the name
of that Tourist

939
01:20:26,493 --> 01:20:26,994
Yes Prashant...

940
01:20:27,286 --> 01:20:28,620
Somebody was saying
just now

941
01:20:28,871 --> 01:20:29,997
That last night Prashant

01:20:30,205 --> 01:20:31,665

And aRer Shanti leR

944
01:20:34,168 --> 01:20:37,212
Prashant was loitering alone near
the Temple till morning

945
01:20:37,421 --> 01:20:38,005
lt can't be
possible

946
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:39,882
lt's a false accusation
on Mr.Prashant

947
01:20:40,048 --> 01:20:40,883
He can never do such
a thing

948
01:20:41,091 --> 01:20:41,884
Who is accussing?

949
01:20:42,217 --> 01:20:44,261
Under the circumstances doubt
can crop up,what do you say?

950
01:20:44,511 --> 01:20:45,262
Yes Yes

951
01:20:45,721 --> 01:20:47,473
He can do it,why was
he loitering-

952
01:20:47,681 --> 01:20:48,765
Near the Temple whole
night?

953
01:20:51,685 --> 01:20:53,812
Are you sure he will come?

954
01:20:54,897 --> 01:20:55,606
Yes mother

955
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:58,275
And l'm very sure that he
won't come

956
01:20:58,692 --> 01:21:02,529
Whole night l was awake,
By seeing you awake

957
01:21:02,738 --> 01:21:04,198
For one hour l am
seeing you-

958
01:21:04,364 --> 01:21:06,450
Standing in the window
scanning the road

959
01:21:07,743 --> 01:21:11,830
Getting attached to a stranger
so soon,l can't understand it

960
01:21:12,539 --> 01:21:17,169
l think by now he must have
IeR Katmandu

961
01:21:17,461 --> 01:21:18,712
l have prepared Tea

962
01:21:20,214 --> 01:21:21,840

966
01:21:47,658 --> 01:21:48,283

l came to know last night,how
much you love me

968

Believe me,lf Meer's Daddy didn't
drag us away forcibily

969
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:01,213
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy,

970
01:22:01,421 --> 01:22:04,216
How has our parents obliged us by
bringing us into the World?

971
01:22:04,508 --> 01:22:08,262
lt was their moment o!ioy 8
passion that we were born

972
01:22:08,679 --> 01:22:10,806
Yes,Had they asked us
before giving birth-

973
01:22:11,014 --> 01:22:12,975
lf would have been a
different matter

974
01:22:13,183 --> 01:22:14,601
Stop being Philosphical-

975
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:17,437
Daddy is bent up on auctioning
our dress shop

976
01:22:17,729 --> 01:22:19,940
Come,we'll not give him a chance
to reach boutique before us!

977
01:22:20,274 --> 01:22:22,985
What did you say?your Daddy
is auctioning the clothes!

978
01:22:23,193 --> 01:22:26,280
Great! that means it'll be free
to the needy and poor!

979
01:22:26,488 --> 01:22:28,574
Come on friend,help me in taking out
my pant from the Cup-board!

980
01:22:28,782 --> 01:22:30,576
And help me in wearing
this stockings!

l am afraid,may be your father

983
01:24:28,402 --> 01:24:30,404
Both Mr.Shastri and Sathi
say that they saw

984
01:24:30,571 --> 01:24:33,740
Prashant talking with Shanti
all through the night there!

985
01:24:34,199 --> 01:24:38,036
Now,tell me,who else was with
Prashant other than you!

986
01:24:38,203 --> 01:24:39,163
Mr.Prashant is
not a thief!

987
01:24:39,371 --> 01:24:41,373
lt is as truthful as the God
in the Temple!

988
01:24:41,456 --> 01:24:44,084
And it may be as false as,this
isn't the Temple of Suyambu

989
01:24:44,293 --> 01:24:46,753
Mr.lnspector! If Prashant
isn't the thief!

990
01:24:46,962 --> 01:24:48,338
Then,no one else is a thief!

991
01:24:48,505 --> 01:24:50,674
Because,Prashant is
the thief!

992
01:24:50,883 --> 01:24:53,427
No one else is a thief other
than Prashant!

993
01:24:53,719 --> 01:24:56,096
Mr.lnspector! Ask him,
where the 3 were?

994
01:24:56,305 --> 01:24:58,432
What they were doing,all the
day with Prashant!

995
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:02,853
He,Toofan and Shanti!

996
01:25:03,770 --> 01:25:04,938
Mother,l am going for work!

997
01:25:05,439 --> 01:25:07,274
lf Prashant comes,tell him
that l can't meet him!

998
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:09,151
Tell him to forget about yesterday
night's matter!

999
01:25:09,401 --> 01:25:10,903
And never try to
follow me!

1000
01:25:12,404 --> 01:25:16,074
Prashant is his name,
take down!

1001
01:25:16,283 --> 01:25:18,118
l am Toofan! and his
name is Masina!

1002
01:25:18,368 --> 01:25:20,245
We were with him yesterday! and we'll
be with him today also!

1003
01:25:20,412 --> 01:25:22,748
lf you want to take us to the
Police Station,take us now!

1004
01:25:22,915 --> 01:25:24,374
Because,we have not committed
any Crime!

1005
01:25:24,708 --> 01:25:27,461
Masina is the son of God! and
l am a guide here!

1006
01:25:27,669 --> 01:25:31,799
Whatever l earn daily,l offer
100/o of it to God!

1007
01:25:32,007 --> 01:25:34,551
And from those,whom l earn
l first test their hearts!

1008
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:35,636
And then their purses!

1009
01:25:36,011 --> 01:25:37,054
Toofan is my name,take it
down again!

1010
01:25:37,763 --> 01:25:39,306
lf ever this Toofan meets
a theif

1011
01:25:39,515 --> 01:25:43,811
He'll iudge him as fast as he
shows this place!

1012
01:25:43,977 --> 01:25:45,979
Write down! Prashant
is not a thief!

1013
01:25:46,188 --> 01:25:47,481
Because,Toofan is his guide!

1014
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:50,484
lt would be better if you two give the
statement in the Police Station!

1015
01:25:50,692 --> 01:25:52,152
Because,lf people have
any doubts...

1016
01:25:52,361 --> 01:25:55,280
Yes yes...l have doubts!
we all have doubts!

1017
01:25:55,489 --> 01:25:59,159
And Mr.Shastri will also not refuse
because he had seen it!...

1018
01:25:59,326 --> 01:26:01,620
l know,why you are aRer
Mr.Prashant!

1019
01:26:01,954 --> 01:26:05,249
lf Shanti loves him,he
isn't at fault!

1020
01:26:05,457 --> 01:26:06,792
Go and tell Mr.Drona!

1021
01:26:06,959 --> 01:26:09,169
Mother,the times are no more for
pity and benefaction!

1022
01:26:09,419 --> 01:26:11,505
lt's a sad news for me to tell
and for you to hear!

1023
01:26:11,797 --> 01:26:14,591
That your daughter has got entangled
into the web of such a person!

1024
01:26:14,758 --> 01:26:17,678
Who has brought dishonour
to me and you!

1025
01:26:18,887 --> 01:26:20,264
She is going to be proved
as a thief!

1026
01:26:20,472 --> 01:26:23,559
That too,whose sin will not be
absolved for generations!

1027
01:26:23,809 --> 01:26:26,937
Son,l am unable to understand
whatever you are saying?

1028
01:26:27,521 --> 01:26:30,691
Mother,How can l explain it to you?
my heart is crying like hell!

1029
01:26:31,316 --> 01:26:32,901
Because,l consider you
very close to me!

1030
01:26:33,318 --> 01:26:35,654
Colonel! You explain her
everything

1031
01:26:35,904 --> 01:26:37,906
Mother,do you see that
thing opposite?

1032
01:26:38,532 --> 01:26:39,658
Auspicious Suyambu's Temple!

1033
01:26:40,951 --> 01:26:43,871
Yesterday night,there was a theR
of the most Beautiful Idol!

1034
01:26:44,079 --> 01:26:47,541
And everyone is doubting
that Tourist Prashant!

1035
01:26:48,250 --> 01:26:51,211
What did you say,son!
Idol of the God?!

1036
01:26:52,087 --> 01:27:00,053
And mother,l am sad for,everyone is getting
informed about Shanti and Prashant!

1037
01:27:00,429 --> 01:27:01,805
This one also...take this one also
take away everything!

1038
01:27:02,014 --> 01:27:06,977
ls there anyone here,who can buy
the full boutique?

01:27:07,352 --> 01:27:09,897
l'll give full stock for rock
bottom price!

1040
01:27:10,147 --> 01:27:11,231
The stock isn't a
robbed one!

1041
01:27:11,398 --> 01:27:12,816
lf you want to buy,pay the
genuine price!

1042
01:27:13,025 --> 01:27:15,777
We have put in months of our sweat
in designing and making them!

1043
01:27:15,944 --> 01:27:20,699
And in these,our forthcoming income of
blood and sweat is also there!

1044
01:27:20,908 --> 01:27:22,493
And that too for
a good cause!

1045
01:27:23,494 --> 01:27:23,952
Look at that!

1046
01:27:27,247 --> 01:27:29,416
Whoever likes this,Can take
this free of cost!

1047
01:27:29,625 --> 01:27:32,753
This action will close the
Boutique forever!

1048
01:27:32,961 --> 01:27:35,923
Dare anyone touches them!touch
only if you have money!

1049
01:27:36,131 --> 01:27:38,008
Or other wise,who likes to
wear them!

1050
01:27:38,717 --> 01:27:44,097
What's the price of that pant
and shirt with silver buttons?

1051
01:27:44,515 --> 01:27:46,266
Why bother about price take
it free of cost!

1052
01:27:46,475 --> 01:27:48,644
Nothing less than Rs 250 it's
the costliest dress!

1053
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:51,814
Don't consider it as your
Dad's free property!

1054
01:27:52,022 --> 01:27:53,774
These are,if not made from your
Dad's money!

1055
01:27:53,941 --> 01:27:55,484
Then with those money,they
were made?

1056
01:27:55,692 --> 01:27:56,944
Don't listen to him?!

1057
01:27:57,152 --> 01:27:58,695
Take away,whichever
you like!

1058
01:27:58,904 --> 01:28:02,616
They have already brought bad reputation
to our culture and civilization!

1059
01:28:02,825 --> 01:28:05,911
With their wrongful,worthless
and absurd decisions!

1060
01:28:06,078 --> 01:28:07,538
Quickly,empty this bus!

1061
01:28:07,746 --> 01:28:10,749
So that l can fill you
colourful people in them

1062
01:28:10,916 --> 01:28:13,585
And take you out of this
City forever!

1063
01:28:15,128 --> 01:28:20,175
l fully agree with you
and your way of life!

1064
01:28:21,927 --> 01:28:23,804
Whenever,l see you
and meet you

1065
01:28:24,012 --> 01:28:27,641
l feel there is an unbreakable
bond of relationship between us!

1066
01:28:35,983 --> 01:28:39,027
Will you give back that dress?
and leave this place?

1067
01:28:39,653 --> 01:28:41,488
lf you can stop me from buying it
take a chance

1068
01:28:42,531 --> 01:28:44,241
And,this is its price!

1069
01:28:51,874 --> 01:28:52,916
He is Prashant Jaiswal!

1070
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:55,836
Your information is correct,he's
staying in Mansarovar Hotel!

1071
01:28:56,044 --> 01:28:57,421
And he is a pilot with
Indian Airlines!

1072
01:28:57,921 --> 01:29:00,757
According to his father's letter his
intention of coming here is...

1073
01:29:02,384 --> 01:29:06,013
That boy Sathi was always accusing
him,what's his intention?

1074
01:29:06,305 --> 01:29:07,681
For whom does this
Sathi work?

1075
01:29:07,890 --> 01:29:08,223
For Mr.Drona!

1076
01:29:09,224 --> 01:29:11,852
And l have heard that
Mr.Drona loves Shanti!

1077
01:29:12,561 --> 01:29:13,687
And Shanti loves
Prashant!

1078
01:29:13,979 --> 01:29:15,689
Yes sir! That's what
l have heard!

1079
01:29:16,064 --> 01:29:19,568
May be,it could be like this Mr.Drona
has some bad intentions in this?

1080
01:29:19,902 --> 01:29:20,277
Sir!

1081
01:29:21,612 --> 01:29:23,530
Accusing Prashant and
getting him caught!

1082
01:29:46,428 --> 01:29:47,554
The Bill is for Rs 65

1083
01:29:48,430 --> 01:29:51,475
And this Jacket! About which
you were asking! It's worth Rs 12O

1084
01:29:54,978 --> 01:29:57,606
Uncle! If that man outside
enquires about me

1085
01:29:57,815 --> 01:29:58,398
Tell him that,l am
not here

1086
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:07,533
Tell Miss.Shanti...

1087
01:30:07,741 --> 01:30:08,534
Shanti is not here...

1088
01:30:09,576 --> 01:30:12,079
lf she comes back,give her
this on behalf of me!

1089
01:34:59,741 --> 01:35:01,493
This is from me!

1090
01:35:02,327 --> 01:35:05,372
You too wear it with as much of love
with which l wore this!

1091
01:35:05,581 --> 01:35:08,167
This is a product of Tibetan culture centre!
not to be given free of cost!

1092
01:35:08,458 --> 01:35:11,503
This Centre hasn't taken a contract
for the love of you both!

1093
01:35:11,712 --> 01:35:12,880
Where did that
Manager go?

1094
01:35:13,088 --> 01:35:13,964
l am not taking it
free of cost!

1095
01:35:14,798 --> 01:35:16,967
Mr.Manager please cut the price
from my salary!

1096
01:35:17,134 --> 01:35:17,885
Yes...Yes...Why not?!

1097
01:35:18,093 --> 01:35:23,891
No Mr.Manager,let him keep it
as a charity from me!

1098
01:35:24,099 --> 01:35:25,058
Wear it quickly!

1099
01:35:25,267 --> 01:35:31,398
Because,now she's going to take him from
here to Snowclad mountains!

1100
01:35:31,732 --> 01:35:32,232
What?!

1101
01:35:32,399 --> 01:35:34,526
How can l refuse your orders
Mr.Drona?

1102
01:35:35,736 --> 01:35:37,154
Look l am wearing
the Jacket!

1103
01:35:37,362 --> 01:35:39,114
lf you have gut's take it

1104
01:35:39,907 --> 01:35:41,200
And now,l am going
with Shanti

01:35:41,408 --> 01:35:44,411
While you are watching,to the
priest of the Temple!

1106
01:35:45,037 --> 01:35:47,372
So that he ties a knot
between us

1107
01:35:47,539 --> 01:35:50,250
Which millions of people like will never
be able to break it even it desired!

1108
01:35:59,218 --> 01:36:01,386
Mr.Manager this is the price
of your Jacket!

1109
01:36:01,595 --> 01:36:02,763
And a few more!

1110

And these Garlands

On this anspicious day don't tell Prashant
about Police enquiry and theR!

1116
01:36:24,159 --> 01:36:26,119
Bless them! Bless them!...you
have brought them together!

1117
01:36:27,996 --> 01:36:30,457
Mr.Sathi please forgive me
If l had hurt you!

1118
01:36:30,666 --> 01:36:32,793
Hey! Mr.Drona,l am not to be
faulted for this!

1119
01:36:33,001 --> 01:36:35,337
My Job is to show the Tourists
places of interest!

1120
01:36:35,546 --> 01:36:38,549
lf someone,develops
Iove for it

1121
01:36:38,715 --> 01:36:40,384
Then,whatever God does
it's always good!

1122
01:36:40,592 --> 01:36:42,636
Whatever God does,it's
always good!

1123
01:36:42,845 --> 01:36:48,142
lt was good...lt was good
Victory to Mr.Prashant!

1124
01:36:50,352 --> 01:36:50,853
Mr.l G P

1125
01:36:58,652 --> 01:37:03,240
l wanted to talk to you regarding
yesterday's Temple's TheR!

1126
01:37:03,574 --> 01:37:05,659
Just now it was on the
tip of my tongue!

1127
01:37:05,826 --> 01:37:08,370
You had asked it yourself and
saw it with your own eyes!

1128
01:37:08,954 --> 01:37:10,622
That Shanti and Prashant!....

1129
01:37:10,956 --> 01:37:12,040
...You too have doubts
on them!

1130
01:37:12,457 --> 01:37:13,125
1000/o!

1131
01:37:13,417 --> 01:37:15,669
lnfact,l suggest that,you search
Shanti's House!

1132
01:37:15,878 --> 01:37:18,338
May be it is possible,that you
get something from there!

1133
01:37:18,714 --> 01:37:21,175
Shanti is working here and Prashant
has come to meet her!

1134
01:37:22,092 --> 01:37:24,595
lnfact he was friendly with workers
and roaming with them!

1135
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:27,097
There's possibility that he may have
passed from your House!

1136
01:37:27,306 --> 01:37:28,307
That you were watching!

1137
01:37:29,099 --> 01:37:33,562
l have a warant in my pocket
to search the entire premises!

1138
01:39:09,825 --> 01:39:11,577
Mr.Jaiswal,you never wrote
about your visit?

1139
01:39:12,411 --> 01:39:14,413
l thought l'll give you a surprise
aRer reaching Kathmandu!

1140
01:39:14,913 --> 01:39:16,290
But,the circumstances under
which we started...

1141
01:39:16,665 --> 01:39:17,916
She had to come from Bangalore!

1142
01:39:18,584 --> 01:39:19,626
And what a coincidence!!

1143
01:39:19,835 --> 01:39:22,004
Our planes reached here at
the same time!

1144
01:39:22,212 --> 01:39:23,964
l am unable to understand
your puzzlers!

1145
01:39:24,173 --> 01:39:25,215
You are coming from Canada!

1146
01:39:25,382 --> 01:39:26,300
Sister-in-law is coming
from Bangalore!

1147
01:39:26,508 --> 01:39:28,218
May be l wouldn't have
written it to you!

1148
01:39:29,344 --> 01:39:30,762
ARer we settled in Canada!

1149
01:39:32,264 --> 01:39:34,183
16 years ago we got
divorced!

1150
01:39:35,267 --> 01:39:36,727
Only children were the link
between us!

1151
01:39:37,019 --> 01:39:39,313
Prashant in India and
Jasbir in Montreal!

1152
01:39:40,481 --> 01:39:42,524
She too aRer Vanishing
for a year-

1153
01:39:43,275 --> 01:39:47,279
lf my friend had not written me
aRer seeing her,Here in a disco!

1154
01:39:47,821 --> 01:39:51,825
Atleast you could have made Jasbir
reply my letters!

1155
01:39:53,827 --> 01:39:56,955
lf l had concealed the fact that her
real mother and bother are alive!

1156
01:39:57,623 --> 01:39:58,790
lt's for her good only!

1157
01:39:59,458 --> 01:40:04,171
lnfact,initially,l never let her
see your's and Prashant's letters!

1158
01:40:05,214 --> 01:40:09,927
At that iuncture it was better for her
to forget about you forever!

1159
01:40:10,552 --> 01:40:13,013
As if you two never
existed in her life!

1160
01:40:14,181 --> 01:40:18,560
Then,would she have forgotten
she has a mother and brother!

1161
01:40:19,645 --> 01:40:20,437
Who are alive!

1162
01:40:22,523 --> 01:40:24,024
Thakur,that is our story!

1163
01:40:25,526 --> 01:40:27,820
And now,whatever you police think
about Prashant,thief or a dacoit!

1164
01:40:28,487 --> 01:40:29,363
He is our son!

1165
01:40:30,489 --> 01:40:32,491
And l have told you about the
reason for coming here!

1166
01:40:33,367 --> 01:40:34,952
Jaiswal! l am bound
by my duty!

1167
01:40:35,410 --> 01:40:37,162
Because,a network has been
established in the City!

01:40:37,663 --> 01:40:39,665
So that,we police without
arresting anyone!

1169
01:40:39,748 --> 01:40:42,376

01:44:49,665 --> 01:44:52,668
My mother told me that,Janice

01:44:57,422 --> 01:45:01,051
Remember Janice! How beautiful these
flowers used to be?

01:45:02,302 --> 01:45:05,848
Beauty is in the Heart!

01:45:14,356 --> 01:45:15,816
Take a deep puff of
this smack!

1176

This will spoil my chest!

lf you want to be with us

01:45:22,823 --> 01:45:24,408
Do you believe in
God or not?

01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:27,161
Janice,will l get God
if l smoke this?

1180
01:45:27,369 --> 01:45:29,913
Great Sages and Great Souls spend
their lifes!

1181
01:45:30,330 --> 01:45:33,417
On the peaks of Mountains
chanting the name of God!

Take deep puffs of this!

01:45:50,476 --> 01:45:51,393
And when the eyes
are opened!

1186
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:53,604
They get mesmerised by the
divinity of God!

1187
01:45:53,812 --> 01:45:56,690
lf you had come for love,then
don't refuse this nectar!

1188
01:45:57,065 --> 01:46:01,445
OtheMrise,l am visualizing that
emptiness will eat you from inside!

1189
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:03,363
And the thirst will
start growing!

You have got peace in this!

1191
01:46:06,116 --> 01:46:06,700
There's Intoxication!

There's love!

1193
01:46:44,738 --> 01:46:47,241
Mr.Thakur's son is also here only
And he has come out just now!

1194
01:47:10,139 --> 01:47:12,349
l am sorry! l have a search warrant
of your House!

1195
01:47:12,933 --> 01:47:13,600
Why? What happened?

1196
01:47:14,351 --> 01:47:16,770
Don't you know about the theR
of Suyambu Idol!

1197
01:47:17,229 --> 01:47:17,855
TheR of Idol!?!

1198
01:47:18,063 --> 01:47:19,273
Golden Idol!! The costliest!

1199
01:47:20,065 --> 01:47:20,566
Don't you know about it?

1200
01:47:21,608 --> 01:47:23,902
Then, are you here with a complaint
that we stole that idol!

1201
01:47:24,528 --> 01:47:27,781
But,we have heard that,Mr.Prashant
is living here only!

1202
01:47:32,828 --> 01:47:34,246
Janice,are you very happy?

1203
01:47:35,164 --> 01:47:38,125
Very much! l never had it since

1204
01:47:39,918 --> 01:47:40,627
When did you leave
your Home?

1205
01:47:43,213 --> 01:47:45,215
May be a year,since l ran away
from there!

1206
01:47:47,426 --> 01:47:49,219
lt's a thrill to run away
from Home!

1207
01:47:49,803 --> 01:47:52,848
Particularly,when you know that
no one requires you there!

1208
01:47:53,849 --> 01:47:55,642
And you have so much love

1209
01:47:55,851 --> 01:47:58,896

Oh! Give it to me! what a

For you,Jassu is dead

l am neck deep in problems

Matters relating to millions

01:49:24,273 --> 01:49:24,898
She'll give the money!

1227
01:49:25,107 --> 01:49:25,983
She is not my mother!

1228
01:49:39,538 --> 01:49:41,165
Madam,lt's a call from
your daughter!

1229
01:49:41,790 --> 01:49:42,291
Oh! yes!

1230
01:49:47,796 --> 01:49:48,672

1231
01:49:49,923 --> 01:49:51,592
Arey! Maid! You said it was
my daughter's call!

1232
01:49:51,884 --> 01:49:52,426
But,this is Jasbir's call!

1233
01:49:52,885 --> 01:49:54,803
l am at Home,why will l
call you in a telephone?

1234
01:49:55,304 --> 01:49:57,973
Mother,l need milk urgently,
l have to go for a Game!

1235
01:49:58,807 --> 01:49:59,975
She'll definitely ask for money

1236
01:50:01,518 --> 01:50:02,978
Yes! What's the matter?

1237
01:50:03,187 --> 01:50:04,897
Shall l come Home

1238
01:50:05,397 --> 01:50:07,441
lt will be better if you stay with
your colourful friends!

1239
01:50:08,025 --> 01:50:10,319
l don't want your bad influence
on my children!

1240
01:50:10,819 --> 01:50:12,946
Anything special on this day,you're
showing so much of love

1241
01:50:13,739 --> 01:50:16,033
l never loved you nor

1242
01:50:16,575 --> 01:50:18,202
But Daddy told me to

1244
01:50:22,122 --> 01:50:23,582
Witch! My mother!

1245
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:26,460
Jasbir! Are you calling your mother
even aRer my presence here?

1246
01:50:29,421 --> 01:50:30,047
Let's have it once!

1247
01:50:35,552 --> 01:50:38,764
From to-day,you'll call me Janice
not Jasbir!

1248
01:50:41,350 --> 01:50:43,185
My real mother was no better!

1249
01:50:44,269 --> 01:50:48,732
But in that party,l felt that her
Iong nails pierced into my body!

1250
01:50:53,195 --> 01:50:55,030
l ran to Dad's Office!

1251
01:50:56,281 --> 01:50:57,241
There was no one in
the Office!

1252
01:50:58,742 --> 01:51:03,080
My eyes fell on the safe!the
key bunch was hanging there!

1253
01:51:04,623 --> 01:51:07,960
l opened the safe! There was
Iot of money!

1254
01:51:09,002 --> 01:51:11,088
l just took $ 5000!!

1255
01:51:11,755 --> 01:51:13,924
And leR a note to
my father!

1256
01:51:14,591 --> 01:51:20,681
From that day it's been
travelling all the time!

1257
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:22,808
Which places did you visit
in that period?

1258
01:51:29,064 --> 01:51:29,898
...And now here!

1259
01:51:30,190 --> 01:51:31,358
Don't you want to return
back Home?

1260
01:51:31,817 --> 01:51:33,527
l hate Home!

1261
01:51:34,361 --> 01:51:36,196
Back to Mother!!
Back to Daddy!!

1262
01:51:37,239 --> 01:51:38,907
l hate them also!

1263
01:51:39,491 --> 01:51:42,369
But,the word'Hatred' isn't there
in your dictionary!

1264
01:51:43,370 --> 01:51:46,957
From that'Hatred'only this much of love
had generated for this world!

1265
01:51:50,169 --> 01:51:51,962
Are you getting remembrances of
earlier times?...

1266
01:51:53,005 --> 01:51:53,505
About your Home!....

1267
01:51:54,756 --> 01:51:55,799
16 years back....

1268
01:51:56,758 --> 01:51:59,052
No,l don't remember anything of
my earlier life!

1269
01:52:00,095 --> 01:52:01,722
l had lost my memory!

1270
01:52:02,264 --> 01:52:03,807
Any relations?!

1271
01:52:04,391 --> 01:52:06,059
These are my relations

1272
01:52:07,352 --> 01:52:08,687
They are everything
to me!

1273
01:52:09,897 --> 01:52:10,814
Any brother?!

1274
01:52:11,523 --> 01:52:13,066
He died very young!

1275
01:52:13,525 --> 01:52:15,486
Jasbir! Your brother is alive!

1276
01:52:17,279 --> 01:52:18,739
l am not Jasbir!

1277
01:52:39,092 --> 01:52:40,928
My Office has been raided! A diary
has been confiscated!

1278
01:52:41,136 --> 01:52:42,429
ln which your name is
also mentioned!

1279
01:52:48,602 --> 01:52:50,854
l have arranged for
everything!

1280
01:52:51,647 --> 01:52:54,942
Your tormentor is sitting with Janice
for the past 2 hours!

1281
01:52:55,692 --> 01:52:57,861
And Janice is in
her elements!

1282
01:52:58,904 --> 01:53:01,573
l feel they have a previous
connections!

1283
01:53:01,824 --> 01:53:03,867
May be,her long lost Brother!

1284
01:53:04,201 --> 01:53:04,576
Brother!?!

1285
01:53:09,998 --> 01:53:11,792
This one is also a stolen idol
from some Temple!

1286
01:53:12,459 --> 01:53:15,963
l swear on God,my Mother
my Husband!

1287
01:53:16,171 --> 01:53:17,798
l am innocent,Mr.Prashant is
innocent!

1288
01:53:18,173 --> 01:53:19,800
We are not aware of anything
about this!

1289
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:21,927
l am seeing this here for
the first time!

1290
01:53:22,136 --> 01:53:23,137
Please believe me!

1291
01:53:23,428 --> 01:53:25,931
Mr.lnspector believe whatever
she's saying!

1292
01:53:26,348 --> 01:53:28,517
l am totally confused!

1293
01:53:28,684 --> 01:53:31,353
All that l know about
Prashant is that...

1294
01:53:31,562 --> 01:53:32,771
lf my daughter has
married him-

1295
01:53:32,980 --> 01:53:34,314
She would have done it aRer
giving a great thought!

1296
01:53:34,481 --> 01:53:37,234
Then,Mother! Do you also doubt
that Prashant is a thief!

1297
01:55:05,405 --> 01:55:07,241
My flower had fallen
some where here!!

1298
01:55:32,432 --> 01:55:34,476
Remember Montreal Janice!

1299
01:55:35,394 --> 01:55:37,604
How much you hated to wear
the Spectacles

1300
01:55:38,313 --> 01:55:40,274
Every one was teasing you in
the School...and....

1301
01:55:41,441 --> 01:55:43,777
l once said,why don't you take
off and throw it?

1302
01:55:44,611 --> 01:55:47,698
Not one,but you have to place all the
flowers of Kathmandu in her lap!

1303
01:55:48,115 --> 01:55:49,116
Only then,you can get her!

1304
01:55:50,117 --> 01:55:51,952
That too new flowers
not the old ones!

1305
01:55:52,119 --> 01:55:53,787
She'll fall for new ones only!

1306
01:56:00,085 --> 01:56:02,588
Later on with Shanti
first sit with Janice!'

1307
01:56:02,754 --> 01:56:05,632
Go,she's asking for flowers from you
go and sleep in her lap!

1308
01:56:06,133 --> 01:56:07,968
Deepak,is your death
calling you?

1309
01:56:08,177 --> 01:56:10,304
Yes! But l'll kill you!

1310
01:57:58,454 --> 01:58:01,582
Nobody should come in between me
and Janice,l'll kill him!

1311
01:58:45,793 --> 01:58:47,920
Deepak! Why did you
both fight?

1312
01:59:10,651 --> 01:59:14,696
Shanti! Forgive me! For leaving you
alone and coming here!

1313
01:59:16,365 --> 01:59:18,492
Don't mistake me,l want to
tell you everything!

1314
01:59:21,453 --> 01:59:22,955
Where have you kept that
Golden Idol?

1315
01:59:24,206 --> 01:59:24,665
What?

1316
01:59:25,374 --> 01:59:26,834
Where have you kept that
Golden idol?

1317
01:59:28,252 --> 01:59:30,963
Golden Idol?! What are you
trying to tell me?

1318
01:59:32,214 --> 01:59:34,049
That idol which you stole
from Suyambu!

1319
01:59:35,425 --> 01:59:37,594
l am totally confused,what are
you trying to tell me?

1320
01:59:42,558 --> 01:59:45,394
Forgive me! l too don't know
what l am saying?

1321
01:59:45,602 --> 01:59:47,896
l am unable to understand
what's happening?

1322
01:59:50,399 --> 01:59:52,067
lt's good that you are not
able to understand!

1323
01:59:53,026 --> 01:59:56,071
ln my heart,l had vowed to
share only happiness with you!

1324
01:59:56,655 --> 02:00:00,284
l haven't given myself the permission
to make you sad with my sorrows!

1325
02:00:01,368 --> 02:00:02,995
lf you don't want to share your
sorrows with me!

1326
02:00:03,370 --> 02:00:05,330
Then,why did you give me
the position of your wife?

1327
02:00:06,081 --> 02:00:06,540
Then,listen!

1328
02:00:07,332 --> 02:00:09,543
The sorrows which you undeMrent
on seeing me with a girl!

1329
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:10,711
She is my sister!

1330
02:00:11,962 --> 02:00:12,463
Sister!?!

1331
02:00:14,131 --> 02:00:15,549
She was separated years back!

1332
02:00:15,757 --> 02:00:17,634
Lost! And she's refusing
to recognise!

1333
02:00:18,760 --> 02:00:20,971
l don't know whether,l'll get
her back or not?

1334
02:00:22,264 --> 02:00:24,475
lf l try to make her remember
she turns her back to me!

1335
02:00:25,309 --> 02:00:27,060
When l leR her she was
a child of 8 years!

1336
02:00:28,061 --> 02:00:31,565
And she believes that she has
no brother,once she had!

1337
02:00:32,900 --> 02:00:33,484
Who's dead!

1338
02:00:34,193 --> 02:00:35,569
How to believe you?

1339
02:00:36,069 --> 02:00:40,032
l told you before God,holding your
hands to believe me life long!

1340
02:00:40,532 --> 02:00:42,201
Shanti! Has your belief had such
a premature death?

1341
02:00:42,409 --> 02:00:43,410
Whom shall l accuse?

1342
02:00:43,702 --> 02:00:46,497
You have been accused of stealing
the God's Idol?

1343
02:00:48,207 --> 02:00:48,707
What?

1344
02:00:49,875 --> 02:00:52,961
Our house had been raided and
a stolen Idol was found!

1345
02:01:04,932 --> 02:01:08,060
Mr.Shastri! Just now,Shanti's
house has been searched!

1346
02:01:08,268 --> 02:01:10,229
And they have got a lot of things
stolen from the Temple!

1347
02:01:10,437 --> 02:01:11,271
Then,have they found the
stolen Idol?

1348
02:01:11,438 --> 02:01:14,441
Not that one,but they
found another one!

1349
02:01:15,734 --> 02:01:18,070
lts obvious that who has stolen this
would have stolen that also?

1350
02:01:18,237 --> 02:01:18,612
Who's that?

1351
02:01:18,821 --> 02:01:20,614
Mr.Shastri,who else can it
be other than Prashant?

1352
02:01:20,823 --> 02:01:24,451
He has trapped Shanti and
married her also

1353
02:01:25,327 --> 02:01:26,954
From the day this man came
to Kathmandu!

1354
02:01:27,412 --> 02:01:29,665
He has disturbed the
peace of this city!

1355
02:01:30,165 --> 02:01:32,626
Neither you are peaceful,Deepak
nor you Janice!

1356
02:01:33,335 --> 02:01:36,130
There he has trapped Shanti
and married her

1357
02:01:36,338 --> 02:01:37,714
And here he is aRer Janice!

1358
02:01:38,382 --> 02:01:42,553
He is behind the great confusion
today at the Suyambu!

1359
02:01:42,803 --> 02:01:46,807
lt wouldn't be surprising if anyone
of us are accused for it!

1360
02:01:47,182 --> 02:01:50,519
On you! On you! On you!...
On me...may be on you Micheal!

1361
02:01:51,145 --> 02:01:56,525
That's why! Beware and don't allow
him into your fold!

1362
02:01:57,025 --> 02:01:59,778
Don't complain aReMrards that
Drona didn't warn you!

1363
02:02:00,195 --> 02:02:01,989
Mr.Drona is telling the
absolute truth!

1364
02:02:03,073 --> 02:02:05,367
lf he comes now,he'll not
escape safely from here!

1365
02:02:05,993 --> 02:02:07,661
Now,he went aRer
getting beaten!

1366
02:02:08,036 --> 02:02:11,373
But next time each one of us will
take revenge on him!

1367
02:02:12,332 --> 02:02:13,500
l'll not leave him alive!

1368
02:02:14,668 --> 02:02:15,711
No,Deepak,no!..

1369
02:02:16,670 --> 02:02:18,672
The thief who stole the Idol has
committed a grave sin!

1370
02:02:18,881 --> 02:02:20,507
God will never forgive him!

1371
02:02:21,091 --> 02:02:23,844
But accusing an innocent is
also a grave sin!

1372
02:02:24,678 --> 02:02:29,850
Somehow,l'll repent for those who
accused Mr.Prashant

1373
02:02:30,559 --> 02:02:32,686
Your repentence will be
Ieave him!

1374
02:02:36,064 --> 02:02:38,525
We'll never allow people from
other places!

1375
02:02:38,734 --> 02:02:43,739
And you have married a man who
steals Idols and sells them!

1376
02:02:44,364 --> 02:02:45,365
How can you say that?

1377
02:02:46,033 --> 02:02:50,537
Then,will he steal to keep them
in showcase of his home!

1378
02:02:51,121 --> 02:02:54,875
This tourist is an orphan! And the Police too
know who this tourist is?

1379
02:02:55,125 --> 02:02:56,084
No....No...its false!

1380
02:02:56,460 --> 02:02:59,421
He has trapped Shanti into
his web to cover up!

1381
02:02:59,630 --> 02:03:02,007
He should be thrown out of
this City!

1382
02:03:02,257 --> 02:03:06,887
By misbehaving with Shanti,he has
brought disgrace to the entire City!

1383
02:03:07,429 --> 02:03:10,557
Because,Shanti is like our Sister
and daughter...

1384
02:03:11,308 --> 02:03:13,227
This marriage is unacceptable!
Improper!

1385
02:03:14,228 --> 02:03:17,231
Shanti shouldn't repent for it!
We all should repent for it!

1386
02:03:17,439 --> 02:03:19,149
The entire City should do it!

1387
02:03:19,441 --> 02:03:22,569
For him Police has raided
all our institutions!

1388
02:03:23,111 --> 02:03:28,117
That institutions! Which spread Gold and
Silver at the feet of God all the life!

1389
02:03:28,617 --> 02:03:31,245
Our repentence will be to take
revenge on Prashant!

1390
02:03:32,037 --> 02:03:34,123
For our City's sake!
For our God's sake!

1391
02:03:34,414 --> 02:03:35,249
For Shanti's sake!

1392
02:03:35,624 --> 02:03:37,209
Shanti had loved such
a mean person!

1393
02:03:45,300 --> 02:03:47,136
Brother Toofan! We should
Ieave Nepal!

1394
02:03:47,344 --> 02:03:50,389
lf we can't prove accusations of
Prashant and Shanti to be false!

1395
02:03:50,639 --> 02:03:51,849
l too think like that!

1396
02:03:52,766 --> 02:03:53,767
The God inside me says...

1397
02:03:53,976 --> 02:03:54,393
What?

1398
02:03:55,144 --> 02:03:56,061
Come to Shanti's house!

1399
02:03:57,604 --> 02:04:01,108
What's this Shanti told about
stolen idols,temple and me?

1400
02:06:04,022 --> 02:06:06,733
This is Jasbir's letter,which she
IeR a year ago!

1401
02:06:09,987 --> 02:06:11,905
What did you give me other than
giving birth to me?

1402
02:06:12,114 --> 02:06:13,615
And that too was
an accident!

1403
02:06:14,324 --> 02:06:16,285
l got boarding school instead
of a Home!

1404
02:06:16,535 --> 02:06:18,287
And a maid servant instead
of a Mother!

1405
02:06:18,996 --> 02:06:21,039
For 3 years,l failed in
Cambridge!

1406
02:06:21,331 --> 02:06:22,749
l wasted your money!

1407
02:06:23,333 --> 02:06:26,503
l'll waste only $5000 more
which l am taking!

1408
02:06:27,337 --> 02:06:30,090
Don't remember me! Or ever
try to search me!

1409
02:06:30,591 --> 02:06:32,426
Because,l'll never remember you!

1410
02:06:33,469 --> 02:06:35,220
l am not Jassu! Jasbir!

1411
02:06:36,305 --> 02:06:40,809
Then open the heart of Janice and
see there's a ocean of love there!

1412
02:06:41,268 --> 02:06:42,769
ln which the whole universe
could take refuge in it!

1413
02:06:43,604 --> 02:06:45,439
And you say that,l don't
Iove you,Deepak!

1414
02:06:56,617 --> 02:06:57,951
This was what l used
to play!

1415
02:06:59,036 --> 02:07:00,454
What were the lines?

1416
02:07:03,832 --> 02:07:05,250
Do you remember anything
aRer hearing this?

1417
02:07:06,043 --> 02:07:08,337
l feel that my Jasbir is
somewhere here only very near!

1418
02:07:08,629 --> 02:07:11,131
This is the same song,which
Prashant used to sing for her

1419
02:07:11,340 --> 02:07:12,674
Yes,he's Prashant! Look!
He's standing there!

1420
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:17,346
Why don't you go and meet him?
He's your son!

1421
02:07:18,222 --> 02:07:19,139
Your's too!

1422
02:07:27,356 --> 02:07:29,149
Prashant! My son!

1423
02:07:33,737 --> 02:07:35,906
l had given you a telegram!
May be you didn't receive it!

1424
02:07:36,740 --> 02:07:38,367
Look,where have l come
in search of you?

1425
02:07:48,752 --> 02:07:50,337
Son,your mother is
also with me!

1426
02:07:54,424 --> 02:07:55,425
Mother,why are you standing
so far?

1427
02:08:04,226 --> 02:08:08,438
Son! Did you meet Jasbir?
She's is in Kathmandu!

1428
02:08:08,814 --> 02:08:09,857
Did you meet Jasbir?

1429
02:08:10,190 --> 02:08:11,358
Jasbir is dead!

1430
02:08:11,859 --> 02:08:13,193
Her place has been taken
over by Janice!

1431
02:08:17,448 --> 02:08:18,949
Do you want to meet
your daughter?

1432
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:21,535
Son! For that only we have
come so far!

1433
02:08:25,789 --> 02:08:28,167
Do you see those people
down there?

1434
02:08:28,500 --> 02:08:32,421
Smoking Hashish,sleeping nude
in each others lap's

1435
02:08:32,629 --> 02:08:33,755
ln each others embraces!

1436
02:08:39,261 --> 02:08:42,306
There in between them,your daughter
Jasbir is also there!

1437
02:08:47,769 --> 02:08:48,562
Wearing that long frock!

1438
02:08:52,399 --> 02:08:54,735
ARer 16 yrs,she's refusing
to recognize me!

1439
02:08:57,070 --> 02:08:59,072
l am not able to recollect
which song was that?

1440
02:08:59,448 --> 02:09:00,783
But,you can't meet her!

1441
02:09:01,492 --> 02:09:03,577
Janice has reached the
other World!

1442
02:09:04,620 --> 02:09:07,581
Where she doesn't have a mother,
father a brother or a sister

1443
02:09:09,208 --> 02:09:12,544
lf your heart is aching to
see her from near!

1444
02:09:13,170 --> 02:09:15,798
l'll remember it now,make
a smack for me!

1445
02:14:44,460 --> 02:14:46,587
No,everyone stop!

1446
02:14:47,087 --> 02:14:48,380
Don't stop them,Janice!

1447
02:14:48,755 --> 02:14:49,798
They have been inert for
a long time

1448
02:14:50,757 --> 02:14:51,842
They are inert and lost

1449
02:14:52,843 --> 02:14:54,928
Probably this is their atonement

1450
02:15:05,564 --> 02:15:07,274
Come foMrard 8 see her

1451
02:15:07,774 --> 02:15:09,526
She has lost her senses

1452
02:15:09,943 --> 02:15:12,654
She doesn't know who has come
and who has gone

1453
02:15:12,821 --> 02:15:15,491
Now its your turn,your turn
8 your turn

1454
02:15:17,618 --> 02:15:20,621
She is waiting for you to wake her
up 8 bring her to consciousness

1455
02:15:25,125 --> 02:15:25,959
Come 8 see

1456
02:15:26,585 --> 02:15:28,587
They have got God on
earth itself

1457
02:15:28,879 --> 02:15:31,215
And when they will reach God,
What will be their condition

1458
02:15:31,882 --> 02:15:35,302
Get up,go to Mt.Everest
go to moon

1459
02:15:35,552 --> 02:15:36,428
Nothing will happen by
Iying here

1460
02:15:37,471 --> 02:15:41,475
Singing under the influence of Opium
smack and hashish

1461
02:15:41,683 --> 02:15:42,768
Nothing will happen

1462
02:15:43,352 --> 02:15:45,312
lf this is devotion
8 this God

1463
02:15:45,646 --> 02:15:49,316
HARE MM HARE KRISHNA that you
are chanting

1464
02:15:49,608 --> 02:15:51,652
Then throw away
these rosaries

1465
02:15:52,152 --> 02:15:54,404
Float these flowers in the river
Bagmati's stream -

1466
02:15:54,655 --> 02:15:55,405
They'll look more
beautiful there

1467
02:15:55,697 --> 02:15:56,990
Tear him apart

1468
02:15:57,324 --> 02:15:58,951
He has stolen Temple Idols

1469
02:15:59,326 --> 02:16:01,745
Because of him our Houses
were searched

1470
02:16:02,121 --> 02:16:03,997
Because of him we have lost
our peace of mind

1471
02:16:04,206 --> 02:16:05,457
This is lie,this is a lie

1472
02:16:09,962 --> 02:16:10,963
Save him!!

1473
02:16:12,631 --> 02:16:15,551
Prashant go away from here
they'll kill you

1474
02:16:16,260 --> 02:16:18,679
l'll not leave you here
8 go Jasbir

1475
02:16:19,513 --> 02:16:20,514
See,who is there?

1476
02:16:20,848 --> 02:16:21,557
He is Daddy

1477
02:16:26,728 --> 02:16:27,688
No

1478
02:16:29,857 --> 02:16:30,691
See up there

1479
02:16:30,899 --> 02:16:32,818
lt's mother,mother

1480
02:16:39,283 --> 02:16:39,658
Daughter

1481
02:16:40,409 --> 02:16:42,703
No,Go away,go away
go away -

1482
02:16:43,662 --> 02:16:44,830
l don't want to see you here

1483
02:16:48,750 --> 02:16:51,795
l have no Mummy and
l have no Daddy

1484
02:17:10,272 --> 02:17:12,900
lf you won't leave him immediately
l will shoot you

1485
02:17:13,400 --> 02:17:14,568
l am warning you

1486
02:17:14,943 --> 02:17:15,527
Who all are staying here?

1487
02:17:15,903 --> 02:17:18,614
First arrest the person who has
committed the theR

1488
02:17:19,323 --> 02:17:20,908
Yes,Yes

1489
02:17:32,044 --> 02:17:37,549
Here,there is a man who
walks like a lame

1490
02:17:40,010 --> 02:17:41,929
lf he is not
the thief

1491
02:17:42,721 --> 02:17:48,227
l will stop my scanty breath
with my own hands

1492
02:17:49,144 --> 02:17:55,776
He 8 sister Janice has committed
this theR

1493
02:17:55,943 --> 02:17:57,444
Janice is his
sister

1494
02:17:58,612 --> 02:18:01,448
Both of them came to Khatmandu
for this purpose only

1495
02:18:01,657 --> 02:18:03,951
And they met each other
stealthily

1496
02:18:04,493 --> 02:18:07,788
And outwardly they were
play acting

1497
02:18:10,707 --> 02:18:11,917
Arrest him immediately,sir!

1498
02:18:13,502 --> 02:18:14,002
What is your name?

1499
02:18:18,423 --> 02:18:21,468
How can you say that he 8 sister
have committed the theR

1500
02:18:22,052 --> 02:18:24,012
Because l know where his
sister stays

1501
02:18:24,221 --> 02:18:25,597
Sir,you search
her room

1502
02:18:26,849 --> 02:18:28,934
Search his room along with
that Sir

1503
02:18:34,439 --> 02:18:35,858
Nothing is found in the room
of Janice

1504
02:18:41,321 --> 02:18:42,781
This is the Idol that was stolen from
Suyambhu

1505
02:18:42,990 --> 02:18:43,824
lt was found in
Michels's room

1506
02:18:47,536 --> 02:18:48,662
How did this happen?

1507
02:18:49,663 --> 02:18:52,166
Probably it reached your room
by magic

1508
02:18:55,002 --> 02:18:57,463
As you sow,so you reap
Michel

1509
02:18:58,088 --> 02:19:00,174
And the Idol that was found in
Shanti's house -

1510
02:19:00,382 --> 02:19:01,300
Who will reply to that?!

1511
02:19:01,758 --> 02:19:04,052
Perhaps Mr.Drona will reply
to it

1512
02:19:04,261 --> 02:19:06,054
Because Mr.Drona's silk
handkerchief -

1513
02:19:06,263 --> 02:19:08,682
Was found in the same room where
the Idol was found

1514
02:19:08,891 --> 02:19:09,183
His name is embossed
on it

1515
02:19:10,809 --> 02:19:10,976
Prashant,my brother

1516
02:19:11,226 --> 02:19:13,061
When Mr.Drona went to meet
Shanti's mother

1517
02:19:13,270 --> 02:19:15,314
By mistake he leR this
also there

1518
02:19:15,689 --> 02:19:16,190
This is play acting

1519
02:19:16,356 --> 02:19:19,526
lt is play acting or truth it'll
be known by your finger prints

1520
02:19:19,693 --> 02:19:20,778
Arrest him

1521
02:19:21,069 --> 02:19:23,906
Not only me but Mr.Drona has
also to be arrested

1522
02:19:24,114 --> 02:19:27,075
Because till date whatever l have
done was under his orders -

1523
02:19:27,326 --> 02:19:28,160
With his concurrence

1524
02:19:28,702 --> 02:19:29,745
lt's all a lie

1525
02:19:30,579 --> 02:19:32,164
Court will decide
about it

1526
02:19:33,123 --> 02:19:35,876
This diary that was confiscated from
your house is a proof

1527
02:19:37,127 --> 02:19:40,881
There is long list of your
foreign friends in it Mr.Drona

1528
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:44,551
To whom many Idols from our
temples were sold

1529
02:19:45,135 --> 02:19:46,094
Arrest him also

1530
02:19:46,929 --> 02:19:51,225
Drona's friends may become his
enemies 8 help you

1531
02:19:51,433 --> 02:19:53,352
But Drona will never become
his own enemy

1532
02:19:53,936 --> 02:19:57,898
Drona will never surrender
to the police,never

1533
02:20:24,550 --> 02:20:26,009
Daddy both of you
meet Janice

1534
02:21:00,919 --> 02:21:02,963
What did you give me
except birth

1535
02:21:03,922 --> 02:21:05,966
What did you give me
except birth

1536
02:21:06,550 --> 02:21:08,844
What did you give me
except birth

1537
02:21:11,513 --> 02:21:13,640
l was pining for brother
for my whole life

1538
02:21:14,183 --> 02:21:15,309
When l met my brother

1539
02:21:15,934 --> 02:21:19,646
lt was too late Prashant

1540
02:21:20,647 --> 02:21:22,316
lt's full darkness

1541
02:21:23,317 --> 02:21:25,819
And l won't be able to see
you in this darkness

1542
02:21:26,862 --> 02:21:28,322
l am going in the light

1543
02:21:29,364 --> 02:21:30,741
Keep on remembering me

1544
02:21:31,241 --> 02:21:33,660
And never stop loving me

1545
02:21:34,369 --> 02:21:39,333
l have loved you too much and
l'll always love you

1546
02:21:39,583 --> 02:21:43,545
Because where l am going
there is only love

1547
02:21:44,963 --> 02:21:48,801
