1
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,065
imagine waiting eight weeks
to get tickets.

2
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,499
When he sings, I feel
he's singing just to me.

3
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:18,503
I don't want to miss a note.
Who wants to hear him sing?

4
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:23,304
You do. I had to give up
a good poker game for this.

5
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:26,470
Keep moving, folks.

6
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:37,950
<i>Star light
Star bright</i>

7
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:41,755
<i>First star
I've seen tonight</i>

8
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,958
Wish I may, wish I might

9
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:50,230
Have the wish I make tonight

10
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:54,569
Star light
Star bright

11
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:58,907
Send me my love tonight

12
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:02,004
If you will, if you do

13
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,572
That's my wish come true

14
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:09,520
<i>In my mind, my ideal</i>

15
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:12,786
<i>Is a creature so supreme</i>

16
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,795
<i>Let me find that she's real</i>

17
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:21,095
<i>And notjust a lovely dream</i>

18
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:25,934
<i>Star light
Star bright</i>

19
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:29,441
<i>First star I've seen tonight</i>

20
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:33,741
Find my love so I might

21
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:38,079
Hold her in my arms

22
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:48,152
Tonight

23
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:54,129
That, ladies and gentlemen,
was Russ Raymond,

24
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,725
<i>America's singing heartthrob
presenting that brand-new number,</i>

25
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,794
<i>"Star Light, Star Bright. "</i>

26
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,465
<i>And so Fluffso Soap,
the soap that does fluff so...</i>

27
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:07,138
<i>brings to a close the 333rd
program of Russ Raymond.</i>

28
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:10,910
<i>If you wish an autographed picture of Russ
Raymond, America's singing heartthrob...</i>

29
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,188
<i>Hi, Pete.</i>

30
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,958
Hi, Dynamite.

31
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:02,968
<i>Where do you gobs want off?
Just dump us off anywhere.</i>

32
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,800
<i>Okay.
Ready?</i>

33
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,340
<i>Thanks a lot.
Okay.</i>

34
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,736
Come here!

35
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,584
Still got the letter?
Right here.

36
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,020
Mr. Thomas Halstead,
Conquistador Hotel.

37
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,082
Must be a big shot if the captain
sends him private messages.

38
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,391
I don't understand why the captain
picked you to deliver a message.

39
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:34,058
Because I'm the smartest man in
the navy. How do you figure that?

40
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:37,193
He said it was impossible for
anybody to teach me anything.

41
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:42,236
Look out! Why don't you
look where you're going?

42
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,623
Hello.

43
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,852
What's the matter
with you guys?

44
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,623
Ain't you got any sense?
You wanna hurt somebody?

45
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,597
You wouldn't drive like that if
there was a cop around here! You bet.

46
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,896
There ain't a cop
within a mile!

47
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:12,131
Nobody would drive like that. Go
call me a policeman. Sure... What?

48
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,368
Didn't you sailors hear that
officer blow his whistle? Yes.

49
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:18,069
What do you think he's doing,
giving bird imitations?

50
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,135
Or does he look like
a peanut stand?

51
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,273
There's a law against
jaywalking! Give him a ticket.

52
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,283
Wait, Smokey.
Keep out of this!

53
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,546
Don't tell him
to give me a ticket.

54
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,815
I'll get you out of it.
In a patrol wagon.

55
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,790
I don't like to give a sailor
a ticket. Hear what he said?

56
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,123
It's your duty.
Leave the man alone.

57
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,662
You keep quiet.
I insist you give him a ticket.

58
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,392
Persistent sort of a guy.
Just keep quiet.

59
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,934
He can't bluff me.
Give him one.

60
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:46,062
Okay, if you insist. What's
your name? Pomeroy Watson.

61
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,131
What ship? No ship. I
ain't ever been on a boat.

62
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,802
What? I only been in the navy six years.

63
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,812
Never been to sea?
No, sir.

64
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,814
Revolting, isn't it?

65
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,941
Next time, watch your step.

66
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:59,609
Both of you.

67
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:02,313
My first ticket, and I
wasn't even driving a car.

68
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,982
See what I get on
account of you people?

69
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,116
Are you gonna
let him bluff you?

70
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,161
Tear it up.
It's no good?

71
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:11,992
Tear it up, go on!
He can't do anything to you.

72
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,157
What's the idea?
That was his idea.

73
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:17,134
Yeah? Tell that to the
marines. That was his idea.

74
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,671
I got a ticket...
Hey, listen.

75
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,333
A clown in a
sailor's suit, huh?

76
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:25,343
Let's see how well you
entertain the boys in the brig.

77
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:28,642
You gotta let him deliver the
captain's letter first. Yeah.

78
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,615
Okay, you deliver that letter
and report back to the base.

79
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:35,120
I'm not gonna have any trouble
out of either one of you. Okay.

80
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,656
You gonna let that big lug
get away with that?

81
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:40,851
I'm gonna call him and you're going
to tell him off. Wait a minute.

82
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,760
Every time you open up my
mouth, you get me in trouble.

83
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,628
All right. Come on.
We'll deliver the letter.

84
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,861
Hey, Smokey.
What?

85
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,962
What a cute kid.
Hello, how are you?

86
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,031
Give me the letter.
Get that letter, will you?

87
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:59,009
<i>There's the letter.
Pick it up.</i>

88
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:01,046
<i>Let's get going.</i>

89
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:04,378
Oh!
In trouble again, huh?

90
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,214
<i>- Can't we fix this all up?
- Not with me, sailor.</i>

91
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:10,084
Here's your money.
Trying to bribe me?

92
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,522
Pomeroy Watson.
No, I was only trying to...

93
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,060
I know. You can take your money
and get out of this area.

94
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:18,028
But this money... You
heard me! Get out of here!

95
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:19,997
Okay. Okay, okay.
Okay.

96
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,104
Hey!

97
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,445
<i>Who is it?
The navy.!</i>

98
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:37,040
Come in, boys.
Get in here.

99
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,550
Are you Thomas Halstead? That's right.

100
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,610
I got a letter for you.
Thanks.

101
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,451
You boys always deliver
dirty letters? Oh, no.

102
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,789
I wouldn't even look
at a dirty postcard.

103
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,626
"Mr. Halstead, enclosed... "
The C.O. wants an answer.

104
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:03,097
<i>You boys make yourselves
at home.</i>

105
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,439
We'd like to, but we can't.

106
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,604
I got a lot of shopping to do.
Shopping?

107
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,739
Where did...
No, you don't!

108
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,283
I'm gonna buy every record
the Andrews Sisters ever made.

109
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,546
I'm gonna buy that one.
Ta, ta, ta-da-da

110
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,555
We'll be right back. You're
a lucky fellow Mr. Smith

111
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:20,114
And you'll be able
to live as you do

112
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,126
And to see that liberty girl

113
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,754
<i>All right.
Doing the things she do</i>

114
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,128
Don't push.
Don't give me that.

115
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,759
You can't spend that money. No?

116
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,497
No, that money belongs
to that shore patrol.

117
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,631
That's tainted.
'Tain't his?

118
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,141
It is his!
'Tain't mine?

119
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,268
What would
your mother say?

120
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:42,109
I don't know. What'll I do? Throw it away.

121
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:45,241
Okay.

122
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,752
What are you whistling at?
Chambermaid.

123
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:52,655
You oughta be ashamed of your...

124
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:57,162
Just the maid, sir. Would you mind
coming back a little later, please?

125
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,129
But I have to make up your
bed, sir. It's been made.

126
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:06,000
But this is the morning
we give you fresh blankets...

127
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,006
treated with ultraviolet.

128
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,065
Conquistador service, sir.

129
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,730
I beg your pardon, sir.

130
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,774
The navy!

131
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:56,150
Well, that's a pretty nice camera
for a chambermaid.

132
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:59,885
It's a hobby of mine. Even
chambermaids have hobbies.

133
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,325
If you want a hobby,
try learning to make beds.

134
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,329
Come back here
with that camera!

135
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:08,493
You've got no right! I oughta
hammer your toy into an ashtray.

136
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,728
You happen to be news,
Mr. Raymond.

137
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:13,897
Why the disappearance act?
That's none of your business.

138
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,669
It's the public's business.
I don't think it is.

139
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:20,007
You've got no right to run out
on the people who made you famous.

140
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,513
They're entitled to know.
What about me?

141
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,549
Don't you think I'm entitled
to a little private life?

142
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:27,552
Look, lady, I assure you
I'm not ungrateful.

143
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,521
I only want to spend
the next six years of my life...

144
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,750
being just plain me,
Tommy Halstead.

145
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,225
Not Russ Raymond,
America's singing heartthrob.

146
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:37,888
Do you get it?
So you picked the navy?

147
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,227
Yes, ma'am, the navy.
I'm a sailor.

148
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:43,427
Just a plain simple gob.
That's going to be something.

149
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:46,528
That's going to be a whale
of a story. Over my dead body.

150
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:50,097
If you print that, do you realize
what my life in the navy would be?

151
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:54,579
Gee, not so good.
Not so good's right.

152
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:57,138
I never thought of it like that.

153
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,480
I'm really sorry.

154
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,544
Let's take the film and
get rid of this. Good.

155
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,318
Excuse me, boys.

156
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,092
Well, that's a fine
"how do you do. "

157
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,827
Fine, thanks. How are you?
I'm all right. Come on!

158
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,392
Not so much noise.
What are you gonna do?

159
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:21,235
Oh, boy, oh, boy!
I've never seen anything like this.

160
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,571
Boy, can you imagine this?
What do you see?

161
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:26,236
Nothin'.
They got the key in the door.

162
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,473
<i>Ow.! Ow.!
Watch the birdie.!</i>

163
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,742
You want some ice water?

164
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:34,650
Don't, that hurts.
Ow! Stop it!

165
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:40,950
<i>Halstead?
H- A-L-S-T-E-A-D?</i>

166
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,859
You say he
enlisted today?

167
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,863
See? That proves it.

168
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,832
Simply proves that a fella named
Halstead enlisted in the navy.

169
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:51,199
How do I know that
Halstead is Russ Raymond?

170
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,670
Brownie, take these.
Because I told you so.

171
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:56,207
Because I brought
this picture to prove it.

172
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,335
That headless wonder could
be anyone. Very clever fake.

173
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:02,676
Why are you so sure I'm
faking it? First of all,

174
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:06,548
no sane man would give up a $100,000-a-year
job to be a $21-a-month sailor.

175
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,554
Second, his disappearance
was a publicity stunt.

176
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,614
Third, you've been trying to get
a staff assignment for six months.

177
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,625
Good day, Miss Roberts.

178
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,888
Mr. Travers, I'll get you
a picture of Russ Raymond.

179
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,362
I'll prove that
he's Tommy Halstead,

180
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,626
and that he has
enlisted in the navy.

181
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,659
Okay, go ahead. And I'll double the
circulation of this magazine overnight.

182
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,729
You get me enough pictures
for a four-page layout...

183
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,798
showing Raymond
as a rookie sailor,

184
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,866
and I'll make
magazine history.

185
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,822
Oh, the Andrews Sisters.
Drive through.

186
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:57,330
Say, I thought there were three
girls in a trio. There are.

187
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:00,167
Something's wrong.
That trio's a foursome.

188
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,868
<i>How long have you been
handling publicity for the navy?</i>

189
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:06,343
Just a short while,
Miss Andrews.

190
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:10,906
I only volunteer my services
when it's... vital.

191
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:17,020
<i>Men, when you came here
eight weeks ago...</i>

192
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:19,887
<i>you only looked like sailors.</i>

193
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,018
<i>Now, you are sailors.</i>

194
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,289
<i>You've worked hard
and you've learned fast.</i>

195
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,196
<i>You've had to learn fast
because these are perilous times.</i>

196
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,928
<i>Today, more than ever
before in our history,</i>

197
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:34,200
<i>130 million Americans
depend upon the vigilance...</i>

198
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:37,037
<i>of the United States Navy
to patrol our two oceans...</i>

199
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:40,476
<i>and to guard us
from any and all enemies.</i>

200
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:44,038
You men, the enlisted
personnel, are the navy,

201
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:46,550
the backbone of the fleet.

202
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,644
Remember what
you stand for.

203
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,746
Good luck, good voyage,

204
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,815
and keep your ship afloat.

205
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:01,963
The ship's are all shined up
The brass is aglow

206
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:05,299
The fleet is all lined up
and rarin' to go

207
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:08,636
The weatherman dreamed up
a sky full of red

208
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:11,574
The boilers are steamed up
so full speed ahead

209
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:14,169
You're off to see the world

210
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,443
You're off to find out
just what makes it tick

211
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:20,485
You're gonna have a look
at all of the oceans

212
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:23,988
And earn your promotions
but quick

213
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,317
You're off to see the world

214
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:30,453
Before you get back
into port again

215
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,657
They want to prove to you
the beans and the gravy

216
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:37,099
They serve in the navy
make men

217
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,366
Up anchor
Hit the deck, you gobs

218
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,374
You're on your way

219
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,273
Though we can't say
which way you may go

220
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:48,472
To Rio or Rome
Nice or Nome

221
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:51,607
Labrador, Singapore
and back to San Diego

222
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,982
You're putting out to sea

223
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:57,113
To see what kind of sailors
you can be

224
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,817
But, sailor, you can bet
wherever you're sent

225
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,689
You're bent for adventure

226
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,820

a world left to see

227

You're off to sea

See you again

248

Good-bye

254
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,649
<i>Miss Roberts?
Yes?</i>

255
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,924
Do you know Pomeroy?
Pomeroy?

256
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:47,989
Pomeroy Watson,
the best sailor in the navy.

257
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,228
He's tall, dark, and then some.

258
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,827
That's what he says
in his letters.

259
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,397
He's living for the moment
when he can crush me in his arms.

260
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,842
And you've never seen him? Not yet.

261
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,937
Oh, there he is,
over there by the cannon.

262
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,608
Is that for me?

263
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,515
Go on and surprise him.
I'm sure he'd love it.

264
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,020
Do you think so?
I'm sure of it.

265
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,614
Of course he would. Go on,
throw your arms around him.

266
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:14,750
Oh, boy!
Come on, Max.

267
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,621
<i>Honey,
here's your dream gal.</i>

268
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:24,429
Look who's here!
The Andrews!

269
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,437
Of all people.
What are you doing here?

270
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,439
Hello, LaVerne.
Aren't we surprised?

271
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,441
Am I surprised!

272
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,543
Excuse me a minute.

273
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,654
Looking for somebody?

274
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,815
Yes, I need a convoy.

275
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,654
What's the matter, sailor?
What's wrong?

276
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:50,820
Well... You found my purse.
Thanks for returning it.

277
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:54,161
Come on, you boob, give the
lady her purse. Certainly, Chief.

278
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:57,464
I believe this was in it.
Too bad the light got to it.

279
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,767
You must come up sometime
and see my candid camera shots.

280
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,376
Sorry I had to run away
like that, girls.

281
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,639
We're the ones that are sorry, Russ.
It was a frame-up.

282
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,705
You're right. What are
you girls doing in the navy?

283
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,841
- She's getting in for a sailor.
- Yeah?

284
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,910
Yeah. Do you know a hunk of stuff
by the name of Pomeroy Watson?

285
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,922
Pomeroy Watson?
Uh-huh.

286
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,924
Yeah, Pomeroy.

287
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,859
Give way, fast!
Fast as you can.

288
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:25,021
There he is, right over there,
in charge of those men.

289
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,657
I might have known he'd be
in charge of something.

290
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,667
He's a big man around here.

291
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,430
I never heard of
such a thing before.

292
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,165
Is he standing in a hole?

293
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,036
Hey, Pomey!
Huh?

294
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,076
There's Patty and the girls.

295
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:48,946
Well, every sailor
can't be a Charles Boyer.

296
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:53,720
Now men, I want you guys to pay
more attention to my commands!

297
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,090
Now, every one of youse,
up oars!

298
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,825
That's enough.

299
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,800
What happened? What happened?
It's mutiny, that's what it is.

300
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:08,101
Put 'em down! Put 'em down!
Put 'em down. Don't forget it.

301
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:12,439
All I said was, "up oars. "

302
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:15,605
Now that's the camel
that broke the straw's back!

303
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,706
Put 'em down!
Put 'em down!

304
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,081
Put 'em down.

305
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,710
This is mutiny,
that's what it is.

306
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,449
I'll put you on the brig,
on bread and water for 30 days.

307
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,423
All you of guys!
No more noise from anybody!

308
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:28,584
Give way, fast! Faster.

309
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,754
One, two, three, four,
five, six, pick up sticks.

310
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:36,267
Faster! Faster! Come on.
Faster! Much faster.

311
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:40,294
Much... Stop the boat.
Stop.

312
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:43,170
That's enough. That's enough.
Stop the boat.

313
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:47,008
S-S-Stop the boat.

314
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,276
Stop the boat!
Stop the boat!

315
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,341
That's enough!
What's the matter?

316
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:57,411
I'm gettin' seasick.
Ohhh. Ohhh.

317
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,593
<i>What's the matter?</i>

318
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:09,699
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

319
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,760
Give him a break, Chief.
He's trying to impress his girl.

320
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:16,296
Sailor, that's not
what the navy's for.

321
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,970
I hope that petty officer
don't get wise to this.

322
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,979
What do I care about
the petty officer?

323
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,981
I've got no use
for a petty officer.

324
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,313
So, I see!

325
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,353
And I don't like pastry cooks...

326
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,354
who try to pretend
that they're sailors.

327
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,481
I was only...
Only trying to be a big shot.

328
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:35,025
Suppose you get back to the galley and
order some of those biscuits into the oven.

329
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:37,027
Not until I get ready.

330
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:39,029
I'm ready.

331
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:46,304
Hello.
Pomeroy Watson!

332
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:51,604
The big shot turns out to be
a blank cartridge. Why, Patty...

333
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:54,840
Oh, come on, girls.

334
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:02,646
Hey, baker, I thought I sent you
back to the galley. Well, I...

335
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:06,680
Quiet! By the way, where's that money
you took away from me on the street?

336
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,692
I wasn't gonna
keep that money.

337
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,661
I was gonna give it to you.
I was only looking for you.

338
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,570
Hello, Pomey, old boy.
You shut up!

339
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:21,572
The whole darn thing is
your fault. Now don't...

340
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,165
You told me to write to that girl
and tell her I was 6'2".

341
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,676
And to tell her
I had eyes of blue?

342
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:29,043
You know I ain't got
eyes of blue. I know that.

343
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,674
And you told me to tell her
that I'm an admiral.

344
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,550
All I am is a baker.
Oh, do I have trouble.

345
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,554
There's no harm done.

346
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:40,182
You not only wrecked my whole life,
but you spoiled my whole day.

347
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,192
Shame on you!

348
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,728
You hit me.
Shame on me too.

349
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:46,730
You hit me!

350
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:49,232
Smokey, I must be
losing my mind.

351
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:51,462
I didn't mean to hit you,
Smokey.

352
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,731
Smokey,
please believe me.

353
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:56,740
I'd never lay my hands on you.
You know that.

354
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:59,072
Smokey, hit me right
in the face. Go ahead.

355
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:02,113
Lot of good that will do.
Make up for that, Smokey.

356
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,240
Hit me right in the face
and make me happy.

357
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:08,309
Go ahead, Smokey.
Hit me right there.

358
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,782
And I had to coax him to do it.

359
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:44,412
<i>Attention.!
Ha, ha, ha.</i>

360
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:47,014
Flotsam and Jetsam.
We sure did fool you.

361
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,026
Oh, lookie, doughnuts!

362
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,028
Kids, get away
from those doughnuts.

363
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,257
It's okay. They're the
commanding officer's nephews.

364
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:56,129
Hey, Dizzy, come here.

365
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,635
Where's that coat
I had made for shore leave?

366
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,637
The white one.
In the clothes closet.

367
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:03,970
Get it for me.
Let's see it.

368
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,602
It's a pip. Steal it
over here. Hey, Smokey!

369
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:09,511
There you are, Joe. It's all fixed. Thanks.

370
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:13,711
How do you like the coat? That's
swell. You look like a battle wagon.

371
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,379
I'm gonna enjoy myself because
I got plenty of money to do it.

372
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,980
Hey! I'm going to spend
every dime on Patty.

373
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:20,991
Where'd you get all that?

374
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,459
I didn't know you had all that money. Sure.

375
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:25,462
Why didn't you
tell a fellow?

376
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,499
You got a certain look in your eye I
don't like. Behave. I'm your friend.

377
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:31,900
What're you doing? A little game
called "find the submarine. "

378
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,996
Like to play games?
That's a submarine.

379
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:37,371
That's a lemon.
We call it a submarine.

380
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:40,172
That's the Atlantic Ocean, that's the
Pacific Ocean, and that's the Indian Ocean.

381
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:41,974
I place it in one
of the oceans...

382
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,481
and if you find
the submarine, you win.

383
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:46,710
Let's play.
Get your money out.

384
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,253
You get the idea of the game.
Now, watch it.

385
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,881
See it there?
We put it in the Pacific Ocean.

386
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,391
Keep your eye on it. Tell me
where it is. I'll take this one.

387
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,893
How much?
Ten dollars.

388
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:59,089
It wasn't there?
I swear it was.

389
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,564
It wasn't there. I can't
help it. It got away... fast.

390
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:03,760
They do that.
You see it there?

391
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,531
How can you go wrong?
Just a twist of the wrist.

392
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:09,233
Where she goes, no one
knows. This one, for $10.

393
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,867
Ten more, 10 more,
10 more, 10 more.

394
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:14,434
Put it down once.
Where is it?

395
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,914
No, it wasn't there and it wasn't there.
Don't see how anybody can win this game.

396
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,917
I wouldn't say that.
I just said it.

397
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:22,715
I'll bet you $10
that it can be found.

398
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:25,722
There it is. If I can find it,
why can't you?

399
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:29,419
What kind of bet is that? I bet
you $10. You pick it up yourself.

400
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,792
That's not good. I'll give
you a chance to get even.

401
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,764
I'll bet you one dollar. Now you
find it. That's on the other side.

402
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,767
You win.
So it's even.

403
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:39,360
What you start betting dollars for?
We've been betting tens.

404
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:42,235
I'll give you a chance to double
up on me. You see it there?

405
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:45,037
Watch it. It's under
one of those shells.

406
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,738
Ten dollars. It's under here.
Go ahead and find it.

407
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:50,303
If he can find it, why can't you?
You wanna make a little bet?

408
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,078
Ten dollars. Under here.
Pick it out. It's up to you.

409
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:55,142
If he wins...
I'll take a chance.

410
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,211
Ten dollars. Go ahead,
pick it out. Where is it?

411
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,883
Why don't you leave 'em alone? Pick it out.

412
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,927
There it is. No, it's here. It's here.

413
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:05,895
There it is. The first
time I ever won in my life.

414
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,898
What do you win?
You had no money down.

415
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:10,059
If you had some money down,
you'd have won.

416
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:13,263
<i>Hey, Smokey, I bet I could
win that submarine game.</i>

417
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,465
Okay. How much you wanna bet? Five bucks.

418
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,735
Have you got a ten-dollar bill
for some ones?

419
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,243
I always carry a ten-dollar
bill. That's fine.

420
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,246
Give me the ones.
There's one, two...

421
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:25,283
How many years have you
been in the navy? Six years.

422
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,079
What's that got to do
with counting my change?

423
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:30,178
Six? Seven, eight, nine,
10. That's much better.

424
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:33,122
Here's your five.
One, two, three, four, five.

425
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:36,251
The idea of this game is to find... Smokey.

426
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:38,421
Wait a minute. What?
Come here.

427
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:41,021
There's somethin' wrong.
You didn't give 10 ones that time.

428
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,398
Here's your 10. Give me back
my ones. Why cheat me? Your pal.

429
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:46,630
That's better.
Okay. Come on.

430
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:50,869
There's one, two,
three, four, five...

431
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,638
Wait. When do you get out
of the navy? In two years.

432
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:56,772
Two? Two years I get out. Two.

433
00:26:56,848 --> 00:27:00,011
Three, four, five, six, seven...
Wait a minute.

434
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:03,782
Did I understand you to say
six? Six years in the navy!

435
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:06,289
That's what it was.
Two years I'm getting out.

436
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:09,020
I had that six on my mind. It's
two years. Don't get me mixed up.

437
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:11,028
Two. Two. Two.
Two, two.

438
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:16,966
Okay, two. Three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

439
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:19,265
Thanks.
That's all.

440
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,031
Got it again.

441
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:27,078
Dizzy, have you got
a 10 for some ones?

442
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:30,137
Sure.
Give me the 10.

443
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:34,242
There's one, two...
How long you been in the navy?

444
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,310
Ninety days.

445
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:39,323
Come on, count it out.
No, you come on.

446
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,325
How long you been in the navy? Ninety days!

447
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:44,521
It's not gonna come out. Something's
wrong. You got yourself into it.

448
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:47,861
Come on, count it off.
I'm gonna get it again.

449
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:51,663
Two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

450
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,605
Seven.

451
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,767
How many months in 90 days? Three months.

452
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:01,005
Three months? Three.

453
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:04,537
Three months. Three!
I got him.

454
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:09,246
Three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, 10.

455
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,788
Yeah.

456
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,847
I think I got it again.
Oh, come on.

457
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:16,223
GiveJoe a chance to win
some money, will you, please?

458
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,922
Look, Joe. You see it there?
How can you go wrong?

459
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,931
<i>It's just a little twist
of the wrist.</i>

460
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,661
<i>That's all there is to it.
It's underneath one of those shells.</i>

461
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:27,102
Dizzy, take a look
under the table.

462
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:29,106
Under the table. You're
a cheater. No remarks.

463
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:31,574
Guy's got a fruit stand
under the table. Keep quiet.

464
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:35,704
Where's the submarine? No,
it wasn't there. It's a gyp!

465
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,214
<i>It's a gyp, I tell ya.
Now, just a minute.</i>

466
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:40,945
<i>All right, there's your money
back. Cheatin' his old friend!</i>

467
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:43,715
Smokey, don't go no further.
I want to play some more.

468
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:45,779
You wanna play some more?
You ain't gonna cheat me.

469
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:49,452
<i>- You got any more money?
- Certainly. I got a bankroll. What odds you're gonna give me?</i>

470
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:51,222
I'll give you two-to-one odds.
It ain't enough.

471
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,161
<i>I'll give you three-to-one.
No. Too anxious.</i>

472
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,222
<i>What do you want?
At least six.</i>

473
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,165
<i>I'll give you five-to-one.
No, six.</i>

474
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,226
<i>I'll give you six-to-one.
Okay.</i>

475
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:02,831
What was that? I don't know.
Somebody's digging clams or something.

476
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,398
I'll tell you what we'll do.
You know where it is now? Yes.

477
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,502
For the bankroll.
The bankroll.

478
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:11,276
Put it all down. Pick it up. Where'd
that come from? You're not mad?

479
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:14,614
Certainly I'm mad.
Then suck the lemons.

480
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:16,984
The worst thing I ever saw,
cheatin' like that.

481
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:20,081
Can you imagine a man doing that to
me? One thing I never do is cheat.

482
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,126
You know where
the submarine is.

483
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:24,525
I know where a flock of
submarines are. For how much?

484
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,292
I know where a submarine with juice
coming out of it is. For how much?

485
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:29,356
For the bankroll.
You wanna bet it all?

486
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,699
The whole works. All right.
You're only entitled to one ocean.

487
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,103
You pick up the ocean.
I'll pick up this ocean.

488
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:38,472
You want that ocean there? Pick it up.
You've got to pick it up in order to win.

489
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:41,774
Find the submarine.
What ocean do you want?

490
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,643
Is it under there?

491
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:45,649
There is a triple-barrelled...

492
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,049
Hey, Dizzy. Hey, Joe,
come here. Wait a minute.

493
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:00,663
Wait a minute, here they are.
"En route to... "

494
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,962
Hawaii. Fine, thanks. How are you?

495
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,310
You like my smile
You like my style

496
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,406
Well, why don't you
make me know it

497
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,474
You like my walk
You like my talk

498
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:23,077
Well, there's only
one way to show it

499
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,554
If you want to shake my hand

500
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,682
Like they do it in Harlem

501
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,693
Stick your hand right out
and shout

502
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:32,025
Gimme some skin
my friend

503
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:34,496
Step right up
and take your stand

504
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,500
You don't have to be timid

505
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,536
Stick your hand right out
and shout

506
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,730
Gimme some skin
my friend

507
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:42,932
Smack it, whack it

508
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,032
Let your hand rotate

509
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:47,236
Show it, blow it

510
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:49,610
Put it in your pocket
till a future date

511
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,911
If you want to shake my hand

512
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:54,110
Like they do it in Harlem

513
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,119
Stick your hand right out
and shout

514
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,587
Gimme some skin
my friend

515
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:02,592
If you like my style
well, show it

516
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:07,222
If you like my smile
let me know it

517
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:11,564
If you like my walk
please tell me

518
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:16,903
If you like my talk
well, skin me, Papa, skin me

519
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:22,880
If you want
to shake my hand

520
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:31,081
Like they
do it in Harlem, baby

521
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,123
Stick your hand right out
and shout

522
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,489
Gimme some skin
my friend

523
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,926
Step right up
and take your stand

524
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:41,830
You don't have to be timid, baby
Stick your hand right out and shout

525
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,266
Gimme some skin
my friend

526
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:46,428
Smack it, whack it
my friend

527
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:49,166
Let your hand rotate

528
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,937
Show it, blow it
Put it in your pocket till a future date

529
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:56,777
Step right out
and shake my hand

530
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:59,112
Like they do it in Harlem today

531
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:01,117
How do they do it

532
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:03,415
Just stick your hand out

533
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,956
And give out with a shout

534
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:10,120
Gimme some skin
my friend

535
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,864
If you want
to shake my hand

536
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:50,798
Like they do it in Harlem

537
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:52,893
Stick your hand right out
and shout

538
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,303
Gimme some skin

539
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:58,975
Gimme some skin

540
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:02,910
Gimme some skin

541
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,747
My friend

542
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:22,062
What's the matter? That's the
girl with the camera complex.

543
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:24,067
I gotta get back
because I'm on duty,

544
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:26,069
but I'll sneak in later
and we'll have a dance.

545
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,105
I'll be waiting, Mr. Dugan.
How are ya, Dynamite?

546
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,333
How are my boys behaving? Fine.

547
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:35,078
Good evening.

548
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:38,013
Oh. Hello.

549
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:41,950
I think I owe you an
apology. I think you do.

550
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:46,013
<i>Well, we agree
on something.</i>

551
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:49,218
I apologize for pulling
that gag on you. Gag?

552
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:52,729
<i>You really thought I was
Russ Raymond, didn't you?</i>

553
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:55,425
I did and I still do.

554
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,300
<i>I've been mistaken for him a lot
of times. I am Tom Halstead.</i>

555
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,736
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

556
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:05,037
I hope that guy Raymond stays lost
so I can have a little peace.

557
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:07,043
Well, if you're not
Russ Raymond,

558
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:09,238
then you won't mind
my taking your picture.

559
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:11,247
No, I'll even
strike a pose.

560
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,283
How's this right here?

561
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,410
Or would you rather
have this?

562
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:17,283
Anything'll do.

563
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,380
Good.

564
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:21,755
There you are. No hard feelings.
None at all, Mr. Raymond.

565
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:24,090
I'll be seeing you
in our magazine.

566
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:26,460
Here's the "flim. "
Thanks, my friend.

567
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,897
Give us some skin.
Sure. Skin.

568
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,934
Come on, if you want to
see the Andrews Sisters.

569
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:38,637
Hello, girls.
Gee, that number was swell.

570
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:42,736
Hello, Patty. You can call me
Miss Andrews and from a distance.

571
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,748
Give me a chance to explain
on the dance floor...

572
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:46,750
where we can have
a little privacy, huh?

573
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:49,480
It's too crowded here.
Well, I don't know.

574
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:51,488
Come on, Patty,
please, will ya?

575
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:54,286
I'll hardly step
on your feet at all.

576
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:57,759
Come on. All right. Come on, chubby.

577
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:00,821
She called me chubby.
Oh, boy.

578
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:02,832
Whose feet am I
gonna step on?

579
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,095
Where's your ticket?

580
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:07,797
You gotta have a ticket?
I'll go get a ticket.

581
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:10,636
Then we can dance.
Okay.

582
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:15,237
Lady, give me five cents
worth of tickets.

583
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:19,482
Who are you bumpin' into? You.

584
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,643
I'll not only bump you,
I'll slug you.

585
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,983
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah!

586
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:28,151
Okay. I never fight with
nobody that agrees with me.

587
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,887
Excuse me.

588
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:33,056
Here. Let's go.

589
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,500
<i>What kind of dance
was that?</i>

590
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:42,835
What kind of dance
was that!

591
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:44,534
That was a swell dance.

592
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,634
Did you cut a rug?
Cut a rug?

593
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:50,738
I didn't even get a chance to disturb
the nap. You're just hard to please.

594
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,340
I rushed over to the box office.
I bought two tickets...

595
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:56,181
I come over here to dance
with my girlfriend, Patty,

596
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:59,849
and all we do is hear
the band go "ta-ta-ta, ta, ta. "

597
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:03,690
So you heard the band go
"ta-ta-ta, ta, ta"? I "heared" it.

598
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:07,128
That's gonna cost you two bits
more. Two bits more for what?

599
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,530
For listening
to the music.

600
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,264
Don't let him get away with
that. Smokey, don't push.

601
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:19,332
Come here. You want Patty
to think you're yellow? No.

602
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,674
Okay, Patty, I'll show him. Attaboy.

603
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:24,374
I'm in love. I don't know
what I'm doing. Oh, go ahead.

604
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,348
Blames it on love.

605
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,053
What's the matter?
Smokey?

606
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:32,055
What's wrong? I ain't
gonna fight those guys here.

607
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:34,057
I'll fight them on a field
of honor. They have no honor.

608
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,059
That's okay.
I ain't got no field.

609
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:38,595
Take a poke at him, Pomeroy.
Let him have it.

610
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:41,632
Go on, right on the nose.
Go on, take a good poke at him.

611
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,428
Okay.

612
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:46,061
I'll give five bucks if you
let me take a poke at you. Okay.

613
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:48,401
Oh, what a sport.
Thanks a lot, pal.

614
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:50,702
Okay, kid.

615
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:54,375
Here comes
the five-buck punch.

616
00:36:57,648 --> 00:37:00,481
Here's your change. Oh,
wait a minute. Wait a minute.

617
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,418
I'd like to see you do
that again. Oh, yeah?

618
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:06,251
Yeah. He did.

619
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:10,818
I dare you to try that
on me, brother. Oh. So!

620
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,864
Wait a minute. Why don't you
pick on a kid your size?

621
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:16,491
Let him go.
Hold him! Hold him. Hold him.

622
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,058
Wait a minute. Let him go. Hold him!

623
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:21,502
What's the idea of trying
to pick on my friend here?

624
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,130
All right, boys.

625
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:26,574
I'm not pickin' on him.
Him and me had an understanding.

626
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:30,102
Afraid of the boy, sweetheart?
Don't call me sweetheart!

627
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:32,809
Hey, fellas, there's a fight.

628
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:35,647
No.
No.

629
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,654
<i>Come on, break it up.</i>

630
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,523
What's the matter
with you two?

631
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,687
I thought sailors were fighting men.
We are, but you gotta be on the water.

632
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,958
It's 30 days in the brig
if you're in a brawl ashore.

633
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,966
We're gonna stay right here
and watch the fight.

634
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:52,366
And then we won't wind up
in the brig. No, you don't.

635
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01,601
<i>What do you gobs think you are,
parachute troops?</i>

636
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:09,018
This is the worst predicament
I was ever in.

637
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:10,815
This is worse
than being in jail.

638
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:12,719
Stone walls
do not a prison make.

639
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,725
Nor iron bars a cage. Well, if
they don't, they got us hypnotized.

640
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,785
<i>Which one of you fellas is
Pomeroy Watson? That's you, Smokey.</i>

641
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:20,831
No, that's you.
That's you.

642
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:23,662
I don't know where I'm at.
Excuse me. I'm Pomeroy Watson.

643
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:25,395
Message for you.
Thank you, sir.

644
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,029
Could you get me a sponge cake
with a file in it?

645
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:30,471
I guess not.
I'm sorry.

646
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:44,579
<i>Oh, Smokey. Tommy.
What's wrong?</i>

647
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,680
Fellas, it's the end now.
What happened now?

648
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:50,090
Smokey and Tommy, it's all over. Patty
and I are washed up. What's happened?

649
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,095
What do you mean? She's
going away with a barber.

650
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,597
With a barber?
That's nonsense.

651
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,657
No, it's not. It says right here
in the letter. What's it say?

652
00:38:57,735 --> 00:39:01,728
"Am taking the clipper to Hawaii. " Ohhh!

653
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:06,368
<i>Anything but a barber. I always wanted
to be more than a barber. Pomeroy Watson?</i>

654
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:08,378
Pomeroy Watson,
somebody wants you.

655
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:10,380
<i>That's me.
Come with me.</i>

656
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,416
No, it's much safer in here.
Don't take me.

657
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,951
I didn't do nothin'.
I'm not gonna squeal, boys.

658
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,453
I won't say a word.
I don't care where I'm goin'.

659
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,455
Go ahead,
take me if you want.

660
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:28,262
That's my boss, Chief
Commissary Steward. Yes, I know.

661
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:30,300
My boss.

662
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,563
Hello, boss. What are
you in for? What am I...

663
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:35,298
For six years we've tried to
make a sailor out of you.

664
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,240
Just let me read a few lines
of your record this year.

665
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:41,608
On sentry duty, you arrested a mailman
for taking letters out of a mailbox.

666
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:44,876
How do you like that for nerve?
In broad daylight too.

667
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:47,076
The same day you were sent
to break up a crap game.

668
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:49,119
You lose your uniform
in the game.

669
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:51,086
That's a lie.
It was only my pants.

670
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:55,114
Watson, I've protected you because you're the
only cook that knows how to fix cream puffs...

671
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:57,285
the way the admiral likes them. With jelly.

672
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,921
But this disgraceful brawl
is the last straw.

673
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:02,397
<i>When you get out, you'll be
transferred to the Alabama.</i>

674
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:05,435
<i>You're gonna transfer me to the
Alabama? I don't care where you go.</i>

675
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:09,269
A real battleship?
Going to Hawaii?

676
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:13,333
Oh, oh. I'll be able to get
my hands on that barber.

677
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,675
Thanks, boss.

678
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:19,182
Thanks. I'm gonna be
transferred. Oh, boy.

679
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:25,087
Now, what are you
in for?

680
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:34,789
<i>Oh, a sailor's life is merry
as merry as can be</i>

681
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:38,266
<i>So, ship ahoy, a sailor's life
a sailor's life for me</i>

682
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:42,203
<i>Oh, a sailor's life is merry
as merry as can be</i>

683
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,970
<i>So, ship ahoy, a sailor's life
a sailor's life for me</i>

684
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:47,874
We chip the scuppers
and paint the hull

685
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,879
And scrub the decks
and then

686
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,040
When you think you're finished
you find it's time

687
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,050
To do it all again

688
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,519
They say a sailor has got a girl
in every port he's in

689
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:59,954
Say, that's not the truth
'cause there's lots of places

690
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,855
I have never been

691
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:06,488
<i>Oh, a sailor's life is merry
as merry as can be</i>

692
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:10,330
So, ship ahoy, a sailor's life
a sailor's life for me

693
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,164
You work and slave
and you skimp and save

694
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:13,863
To get a full month's pay

695
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:16,702
Then you lay it down
and a guy says "craps"

696
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:18,799
And takes it all away

697
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:20,810
We greased the engine
and burned up oil

698
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:22,470
To make
some speed today

699
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:24,844
But the only time
that we passed a ship

700
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:26,906
Was going the other way

701
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:31,512
Oh, a sailor's life is merry
as merry as can be

702
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:34,854
So, ship ahoy, a sailor's life
a sailor's life for me

703
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:38,986
When they make a sailor a CPO
they take out all his brains

704
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:42,521
And inject a gallon of vinegar
and mustard in his veins

705
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,534
The chief is great
as a navy man

706
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,536
At least that's what he thinks

707
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:49,698
But I've seen him trying
to swim and confidentially

708
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:52,901
He sinks

709
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:01,618
<i>Ha, ha, ha.</i>

710
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,676
Mutiny! Mutiny!

711
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:05,722
Hey!

712
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:07,780
Why don't you leave
these two kids alone?

713
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,883
Why don't these two kids leave
me alone? Never mind that.

714
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,894
You two get ashore
before this boat sails.

715
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:13,930
Pick up your instruments.

716
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:21,571
Now, you two boys
get where you belong.

717
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,903
And you put some sweat
on that swab.

718
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:28,411
Come on, put some sweat on that swab
or I'll give you 40 lashes.

719
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,640
What about lashes?

720
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:35,081
Do you think mine would
look better with mascara?

721
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:37,643
All right.

722
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,349
Pick up that line.
Aye, aye, sir.

723
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:46,262
<i>Dugan.!</i>

724
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,264
You're wanted below.
Aye, aye, sir.

725
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:53,158
Brother, I'll see you
later. That's okay with me.

726
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,171
You got no right to make
Tommy work like this.

727
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,264
A whole ocean full of water
to wash the decks.

728
00:42:57,341 --> 00:43:00,174
He makes Tommy wash with one
bucket. All right. Forget it.

729
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,109
Always in trouble.

730
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:05,307
How about you and I going
ashore tonight? No, thanks.

731
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:07,850
You haven't left this boat
in a week.

732
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,852
You want to turn out
to be a barnacle?

733
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,013
I like the ship. You like
it? What's the matter?

734
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:15,024
Are you afraid that girl photographer
is still parked out there on the pier?

735
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:17,083
Yeah. I think I'll stay
parked here on the ship.

736
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:19,322
If she wants to get on here,
she'll have to fly.

737
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:22,422
If you change your mind, let me know. Okay.

738
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:29,901
"Pintles, small straight pieces of metal secured to
the rudder and fitting in gudgeons on a stern post. "

739
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:31,965
On the stern post.

740
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:35,705
"Gudgeons, small metal pieces
in which pintles are fitted. "

741
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,713
Pintles are fitted.

742
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:41,217
"The bow is the front.
The stern is in the back.

743
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,219
Starboard is to the right. " Hello. Hello.

744
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,778
Starboard is to the right.
Where's the port?

745
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:47,790
In a bottle in the icebox.
Thanks.

746
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:50,452
Wait, you're not allowed on board
this ship. You gotta get off.

747
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:53,223
I've got to get a picture of Tommy
Halstead. If you'll help... Oh, no.

748
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:56,562
I'm not gonna help. I'm not getting
in any more jams. I'll scream.

749
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,625
How loud can you scream? Ahhh...

750
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:00,636
That's enough.
You gonna help?

751
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:02,638
I don't wanna, but...

752
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:05,174
All right! I'll help.
Thanks, you're cute.

753
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:07,710
I only wish Patty thought so.
Why do I get in these messes?

754
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:10,474
Tiptoe. Shhh.

755
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:16,576
Oooh! Come on. Hurry
up. Get in here. Quick.

756
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:20,890
<i>Pintles, pintles are pintles.
What?</i>

757
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:23,188
Adams is going to
try to make you...

758
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,194
into something
that resembles a sailor.

759
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:27,253
He'll give you the instructions
and you better come up to par.

760
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,265
What's par on this ship?
Seventy-six.

761
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,164
What?
I'm sorry, Dynamite.

762
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:33,533
The time is gonna come sometime.
The time is gonna come.

763
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:36,038
And when the time comes sometime... Well?

764
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:40,304
The time is gonna come.
Get to work.

765
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:42,311
Well?
Smokey.

766
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:44,540
Never mind that.
You heard what the chief said.

767
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:47,914
We're gonna make a sailor out of you.
Where'll I start? In the potato locker.

768
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:50,249
Never mind the potato locker.

769
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,914
But if the officers find...
If the officers find what?

770
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:55,891
There's a tomato in there
with the potatoes. Get it out.

771
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:57,950
Put it in with the rest
of the tomatoes.

772
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:02,692
She ain't that kind of tomato.
This one walks and talks. She?

773
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,700
She's in there.

774
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:08,903
See? What'd I tell you?
There she is. Pomeroy.

775
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:11,406
Don't blame him. I came
to get a picture ofTommy.

776
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:13,636
The only pictures allowed
on this ship are tattooed on men.

777
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:17,112
I told you you wasn't allowed
on this ship. You gotta get off.

778
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:19,274
She has got to get off!
You can't go that way.

779
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:22,045
The OD's on the quarterdeck.
Let's try the 50-cent seats.

780
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:24,383
This is no time to get silly.
Listen, boys.

781
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:26,548
I don't want
to be any trouble.

782
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:30,218
Just help me get the pictures and I'll
slip ashore after dark. Do you promise?

783
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:33,559
Promise.
Cross your heart?

784
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:36,929
I don't like it, but I guess you got us
hooked either way, miss. Don't be formal.

785
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,128
Just call me Dot. Okay, Dot. Come on.

786
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:44,535
Dash, Dot! Dash!
Come on, come on.

787
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:49,409
Not me. Not me! Her.
Go ahead. Dash! Get in.

788
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,414
What's going on in here?
Nothing.

789
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:53,973
Why not? What do you
think you're doing?

790
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:00,486
Well? Dash. Dot. Dot. Dash. Dash. Dot...

791
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:04,789
What is this? Signal practice. Smokey's
trying to resemble me into a sailor.

792
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:07,296
Well, stow it.
We did. I hope.

793
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:13,098
Watson, why don't you keep
these locker doors dogged down?

794
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:15,866
What about the door? You heard me. Dog it.

795
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:19,670
<i>Dog it?
Okay.!</i>

796
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:26,949
Smokey, get a load
of this picture.

797
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:29,645
What is this here,
that these guys are working on?

798
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,881
That's a hull of a ship.
You're telling me.

799
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,981
But what is this they're working
on? Please, don't annoy me.

800
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:37,322
I'm trying to figure out a way
to get that girl off this boat.

801
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:40,886
That's going to be awful.
I wish I wasn't here. You...

802
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:43,489
<i>Smokey, if I didn't know better,
I'd swear we're moving.</i>

803
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:46,730
We are moving! We're on
our way to Hawaii. Yeah.

804
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,068
What'd you say?
Hawaii.

805
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,573
We're going to Hawaii?
Where Patty is? That's right.

806
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:55,703
Oh! I'm going
to Hawaii!

807
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:02,783
With a tomato
in the potato locker.

808
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:06,489
We'll get around to it.

809
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:09,355
Okay, kid,
we'll get around to it.

810
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:13,988
Wait a minute. What are you throwing
your clothes out the porthole for?

811
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:16,089
Porthole?
Certainly.

812
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,657
I thought it was a little closet.
No, come on. Let's get to bed.

813
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:20,896
Not so much noise.
Quiet. Come on.

814
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,699
Come on.
Let's get to bed.

815
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:29,109
Shh.
Quiet. Go to bed.

816
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,010
Where am I gonna sleep? Up here.

817
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:34,175
I said, where do I sleep?
Up in here. That's right.

818
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:36,583
How do you get in here?
How do you sleep in here?

819
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:39,554
Six years in the navy and you
never slept in a hammock?

820
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:42,183
Six years, I was a baker.
I always slept in a sink.

821
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:45,126
You better learn to sleep in
a hammock. How do you get in?

822
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,493
Watch me.

823
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:53,763
Oh, that's good.
Grab on and...

824
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:56,135
Shhh. Don't make any noise. Quiet.

825
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:04,110
I think I made it.

826
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:06,706
Quiet! No noise.

827
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,645
Pretty near made it.

828
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:25,534
Giddyap.

829
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,729
<i>Hey, Smokey.
What's the matter?</i>

830
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:35,972
How can you sleep like this?
How do you lay down? Lay down.

831
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:38,014
How do you
straighten this out?

832
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:41,016
Get over. Okay.

833
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:48,688
Will you go to sleep?
You wanna wake everybody up?

834
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:52,092
<i>Go on. I'm comfortable
down here. It's much better.</i>

835
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:54,357
It's a fine time to be playing
on the deck. Get up in there.

836
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:57,025
How're you gonna
sleep in a snood?

837
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,863
Quiet! Take it easy.

838
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:03,706
Now I gotta
saddle it again.

839
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:09,602
<i>Whoa, boy.
Shh.!</i>

840
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,614
I gotta talk to the horse.

841
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:14,651
Take it easy.

842
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:18,484
What in the world are you doing?
Go to sleep.

843
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:23,857
Whoa, boy. Attaboy.

844
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:26,054
Whoa. Take it easy.

845
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,098
Shh.
Okay.

846
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:39,003
<i>Ahhh! Comfortable. Make it?</i>

847
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:41,135
Good night.

848
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:07,069
Did you do that?
Do what?

849
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:09,071
That clicking sound.
I didn't hear no click.

850
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:12,336
I've been hearing a clicking sound for
a week, ever since we left San Diego.

851
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:14,400
I must have
a bug in my ear.

852
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:16,969
Where do all the bugs go
this time of year? Search me.

853
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:20,039
No, thanks.
I just wondered.

854
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:22,745
All right, men.
Prepare to wash down.

855
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:25,083
You too, shorty.

856
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:32,854
What are you going to do,
take all day?

857
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:35,397
Come on, get that shirt off.

858
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:55,274
What happened?
Smokey. Tommy.

859
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:57,286
Tommy and the girl.
What happened?

860
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:59,447
The lady photographer?

861
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:01,457
Yeah.
No!

862
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,289
Shh. Quiet!

863
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:32,379
Does this happen
to belong to you, sailor?

864
00:51:32,456 --> 00:51:34,185
Thanks, buddy.

865
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:38,423
Novel idea,
traveling in a potato locker.

866
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:41,760
Trifle gloomy, isn't it?
Only when you're around.

867
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:43,663
Who's been hiding you in here? Nobody.

868
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:46,065
Never mind. Pomeroy's
the only sailor on board...

869
00:51:46,136 --> 00:51:48,468
with so few brains,
outside of yourself.

870
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:51,837
He's all right. Do you realize the trouble
he'd get into if the captain found out?

871
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:53,899
Of course you don't.

872
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:56,878
The only thing you've got on
your silly head is a roll of film.

873
00:51:56,947 --> 00:52:00,110
It's my job. It's not your job to
hound me all the way across the Pacific,

874
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:02,811
turning a battleship into
a photographer's gallery.

875
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:05,116
Lucky for all of us we're
only one day from Hawaii.

876
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:08,521
Then I can develop
my... laundry.

877
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:10,389
Your laundry?

878
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:13,293
Oh, your laundry!
Yeah.

879
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:15,297
Give me those.

880
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:18,129
I know a safe place for them.
DavyJones's locker.

881
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:20,567
Please,
can't we talk this over?

882
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:24,198
Sure, on deck tonight.
We're having a band concert.

883
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:27,266
I won't be there.
Oh, yes, you will.

884
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:30,006
Either there or in the brig.

885
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,916
See what I mean, boys?
You mean something like this?

886
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:10,142
Hey, boys. You, come here.
Come on, come on.

887
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:12,374
Can you boys do anything
to entertain the men?

888
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:14,747
Well... If you turn that
band over to us, we can.

889
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:16,945
The whole band? We used
to have a band back home.

890
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,079
The Tenth Avenue Guttersnipes. Quiet!

891
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:21,953
<i>All right, all right.! What do
you think I got that medal for?</i>

892
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:23,993
All right, boys.
You can take over.

893
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:26,392
From now on,
it's every man for himself.

894
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:28,397
Don't sink the boat.

895
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:30,023
Sit down.
Right.

896
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:44,612
We're in the navy

897
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:48,617
Watchdogs of liberty

898
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:52,416
We're in the navy

899
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:56,289
Scrappy, happy-go-lucky
sons of the sea

900
00:54:56,359 --> 00:55:00,193
First in line
and set to clear the deck

901
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:02,288
Any galoot who wants a dispute

902
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:04,026
Will get it in the neck

903
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:08,127
So gangway
Don't cross our bow

904
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:11,731
We're in the navy now

905
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:15,877
Boom, boom, boom, boom

906
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:19,176
A sailor has to know
when Uncle Sam has got a foe

907
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:23,276
Who won't behave
he sends the navy

908
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:26,845
With danger at his side
a sailor guards his country's pride

909
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:30,916
And on the wave
he is the navy

910
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,689
On the Atlantic
Yeah!

911
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:34,889
On the Pacific
Yeah!

912
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:38,229
Whether it's peace whether
it's war the navy's terrific

913
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:42,533
Wherever the situation's tense

914
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:47,099
We're the first line
of defense

915
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:50,806
We're in the navy

916
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,839
Watchdogs of liberty

917
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:58,183
We're in the navy

918
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:02,384
Scrappy, happy-go-lucky
sons of the sea

919
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:06,122
First in line
and set to clear the deck

920
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:09,654
Any galoot who wants a dispute
will get it in the neck

921
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:13,965
So gangway
Don't cross our bow

922
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:17,370
We're in the navy now

923
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,841
On the Atlantic
On the Pacific

924
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:25,279
Stand clear
Don't cross our bow

925
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:28,977
We're in the navy

926
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:35,389
Now

927
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,755
Up!
Whoa! Ooo!

928
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:46,268
Hey! Hey!

929
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:49,271
Let go! Back up!
I'm a member.

930
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:52,638
I'm a member! I'm a member! Come here.

931
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:55,371
You never told me about
this kind of initiation.

932
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:58,881
That's what they do
when they cross the equator.

933
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:01,007
You want to belong
to the Sons of Neptune?

934
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,609
Yeah, but I'm no aviator.
All right.

935
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:06,780
You passed the blanket test. Now you
have to be passed by the committee.

936
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:09,324
<i>Ready, committee?</i>

937
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:11,326
You'll face the committee
right about here.

938
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:13,259
Right here.

939
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,758
I'm a member!

940
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:22,202
I'm gonna be
one of you guys.

941
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:29,111
Pomeroy Watson, before you can become
a member of the Sons of Neptune,

942
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:31,545
<i>you'll answer this question
truthfully. Yes, sir.</i>

943
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:33,946
<i>If you had your choice,</i>

944
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:36,747
what branch of the service would
you prefer... air, land or water?

945
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,481
Gimme the water.

946
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:48,623
That's a pretty good initiation.
Oh, yeah.

947
00:57:48,698 --> 00:57:51,064
I like it.
Yes.

948
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,762
Does Smokey know anything
about this? Of course not.

949
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:55,771
Tell me the truth.
Honest.

950
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:58,364
He don't, huh?
Uh-oh, here he comes.

951
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:00,375
How would you like to join...
How would you like to join...

952
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:02,377
He knows.
He doesn't know.

953
00:58:02,445 --> 00:58:04,379
Did you hear that? I heard it,
but he doesn't know. Coincidence.

954
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:07,041
If you had your choice...
If you had your choice...

955
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:09,050
He knows it.
He don't know it.

956
00:58:09,118 --> 00:58:12,747
Ask him if he wants to be a Son of Neptune. Ask him
if he wants to be on land, in water, or in the air.

957
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:14,813
When he says "give me the water,"
give it to him!

958
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:16,825
Hey, what's this
all about?

959
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:20,021
All us guys, we belong to
the Sons of Neptune club. Yes.

960
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:22,155
Ooh. If you want to join, it's okay.

961
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:24,166
Then Father Neptune
will be your boss.

962
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:27,465
Neptune will reign over
me? A cloudburst over you.

963
00:58:27,537 --> 00:58:29,801
Don't tip it off.
Ask him the questions.

964
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:32,671
I don't get it. You should get
it half as good as I got it.

965
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:35,142
Did you get it?
This ain't perspiration.

966
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:38,339
No, no. I want it good.
You won't get disappointed.

967
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:40,348
That's swell. Stand here. Don't go away.

968
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:42,350
Hold him here.

969
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:51,984
Shh. Shh. Shh.

970
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,734
I swallowed it.

971
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:23,653
Uh-uh. Hmm?
Mm-mmm.

972
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:33,827
Uh-oh.

973
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,928
Mm-mmm!
Uh-uh.

974
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:38,735
Mmm! Mmm!
Uh-uh! Uh-uh!

975
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:41,072
Mm-mm-mm-mm!
Mm!

976
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:42,839
Mm-uh...

977
01:00:00,663 --> 01:00:02,392
Mmm!
Mmm!

978
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:05,662
Hm-mmm! Mmm-mmm-mmm.
Mmm. Uh-mmm.

979
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,431
Why didn't you say,
"Give me the water"?

980
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:09,321
Tommy, thank you
for bringing us in here...

981
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:11,333
so I could see
my girlfriend, Patty.

982
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:14,893
I'll ask you to do something
for me sometime. Glad to.

983
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:22,341
It's okay, kid. What are
you eating that skin for?

984
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:26,371
I like it. With all this
delicious native food around here?

985
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:28,383
Taste that dish.
What?

986
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:30,817
Taste that dish.

987
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:33,515
It's delicious.

988
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:35,318
How do you like it?
Good.

989
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:37,484
What are you doing?

990
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,858
Show place
of the island.

991
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:43,558
I came in here to make an impression with
my girlfriend. Don't give me that stuff.

992
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:49,199
Boy, that was a beauty. Now, come
on, honey. Let's you and me go places.

993
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:51,263
No, no, Tommy!
Wait, Tommy.

994
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:54,070
Tommy, no! I've got to get
that camera away from her.

995
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:56,077
And get in a fight
with Dynamite?

996
01:01:56,145 --> 01:01:58,705
And give her a chance to take 10 more
pictures of you being dragged to the brig?

997
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:13,929
Ka-pu, ka-pu

998
01:02:13,996 --> 01:02:16,897
This isn't for a guy
like Toscanini

999
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:19,560
Or any other
icky Malahini

1000
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:22,570
Ka-pu, ka-pu

1001
01:02:22,638 --> 01:02:24,697
Here is a real
Hawaiian treat

1002
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:27,470
With a boogie-woogie beat

1003
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:32,913
It's just an old Hawaiian
hula-ba-luau

1004
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:34,973
Where you can do
a hula creation

1005
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:38,851
With boogie syncopation
that will give you a spin

1006
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:44,086
You want to go and see
a hula-ba-luau

1007
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,628
'Cause when you do
a pretty Hawaiian

1008
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:50,530
Will start the grass a-flyin'
and you'll have to join in

1009
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,364
They sing to the beat
of the native drum

1010
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,563
And the mellow steel guitar

1011
01:02:55,638 --> 01:02:58,766
She'll be comin' around
the old volcano when she comes

1012
01:02:58,841 --> 01:03:01,401
Singin', beat me, beat me, Daddy
eight to the bar

1013
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:06,312
And when you've been
to see a hula-ba-luau

1014
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:08,873
You'll never rue a moment
you spent there

1015
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:13,081
You'll be so glad you went there And I
know you'll agree that everybody should see

1016
01:03:13,156 --> 01:03:17,786
A hula-ba-luau right now

1017
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:27,193
Ooo-ooo

1018
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:32,264
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo

1019
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:37,643
Ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo

1020
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:42,377
Ooo-ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo-ooo

1021
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:46,244
Ta-heepa-honay-honay
maka-ula-pa-la-la

1022
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:49,587
Ta-ua-pa-la-la
ta-ta-ta-ua-pa-la-la

1023
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:52,719
Ay-ya-ha-ta-wa-mow
wa-e-say-day-pay

1024
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:55,286
Wa-tay-ta-say-mow-wa-e
mow-wa-e-say-day-pay

1025
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:58,197
Hey-ya-wow-ta-wa-e-say hi-u

1026
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:03,767
They sing to the beat
of the native drum

1027
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,070
Tittle-e-a
and a mellow steel guitar

1028
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:08,667
She'll be comin' around
the old volcano when she comes

1029
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:11,372
Singin', beat me, beat me, Daddy
eight to the bar

1030
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:16,180
And when you've been to see
a hula-ba-luau

1031
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:18,777
You'll never, never rue a moment
you spent there

1032
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,789
You'll be so glad
you went there

1033
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,848
And I know you'll agree
that everybody should see

1034
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:25,450
A hula-ba-luau

1035
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:31,228
Right now

1036
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:46,809
Come on. I'm just wild
to see him in uniform.

1037
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,750
General, do you know if
Russ Raymond's on this boat?

1038
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:52,947
<i>It's a ship, lady.</i>

1039
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:56,924
<i>I'm dying to put one
of these leis around his neck.</i>

1040
01:04:56,993 --> 01:05:00,019
I'm going to get his autograph
if I have to wreck the whole navy.

1041
01:05:00,096 --> 01:05:02,189
<i>Can you tell me
where Russ Raymond is?</i>

1042
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:41,495
This happen to belong to you, sailor? Ow!

1043
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:45,836
Please, Tommy.
Let me explain.

1044
01:05:45,908 --> 01:05:48,934
We're locked in.
Some more of your work?

1045
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:53,345
No, but that's fine. Now you'll have to listen to
me about the pictures. I know all about the pictures.

1046
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:55,680
I've got an idea that's gonna
straighten everything out.

1047
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:58,413
No, you don't. You've caused
me enough trouble. Listen to me.

1048
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:00,819
I don't mean any... I'm very
busy here in the kitchen.

1049
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:03,688
Don't bother me.
Do your work, but don't do mine.

1050
01:06:03,759 --> 01:06:07,286
Put it down. Why don't you
give me the end with the towels?

1051
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:09,957
Hey, doughnuts!
No, Smokey! Don't!

1052
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:12,227
One doughnut.
I haven't got enough.

1053
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:14,235
I just baked
28 of these things.

1054
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:16,237
There's seven officers
to feed.

1055
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,967
I've got just enough to
give them... 13 apiece. What?

1056
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:21,100
Thirteen apiece.
Thirteen apiece?

1057
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:23,304
Seven officers,
each gets 13.

1058
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:27,145
You've only got 28. Right,
28 doughnuts and seven, 13...

1059
01:06:27,216 --> 01:06:29,081
I gotta give 'em to them.
Seven thirteens are 28?

1060
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:32,712
That's ridiculous! Seven times
four is 28. It's got to be right...

1061
01:06:32,788 --> 01:06:36,155
Seven times four is 28?
Sure.

1062
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:38,955
He must have went
to a cheap school.

1063
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:42,191
Seven times 13 is 28.
Ridiculous!

1064
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:44,494
Come here. I'll figure it out for
you. What's the matter with you?

1065
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:47,001
I've got this all figured out. You have?

1066
01:06:47,069 --> 01:06:49,003
Prove that to me. I'm
gonna prove it. Don't worry.

1067
01:06:49,071 --> 01:06:51,631
Ridiculous. Come, come. No, it ain't.

1068
01:06:51,707 --> 01:06:54,039
It's not ridiculous. There's
no sense to your argument.

1069
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:56,101
Go ahead.
You'll see.

1070
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:58,772
Now, there were seven
officers. That's right.

1071
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:01,282
There's a seven. Now I'm
gonna divide and prove it.

1072
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:03,284
Twenty-eight doughnuts.
Twenty-eight doughnuts.

1073
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:06,082
You claim seven goes into
2813 times? Prove it to me.

1074
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:08,419
Seven into two. What do
you mean, seven into two?

1075
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:10,857
Seven will not go into two no matter
how much you try. We know that.

1076
01:07:10,926 --> 01:07:12,917
You couldn't push that big seven
into that little two. Certainly not.

1077
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:14,929
Therefore, we can't use the two.
What are you gonna do with it?

1078
01:07:14,997 --> 01:07:18,626
I'm gonna let Dizzy hold it. Dizzy, you hold
that two for me. Will you, please? Thank you.

1079
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:21,033
I'll use it later.
What is this all about?

1080
01:07:21,103 --> 01:07:22,866
Seven into eight... one.

1081
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:25,964
Now, we're gonna carry
the seven. So carry it.

1082
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:28,374
It's gettin' heavy,
so I'll put it down there.

1083
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:30,435
Seven from eight... one.

1084
01:07:30,513 --> 01:07:32,572
A minute ago,
we didn't use the two.

1085
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:34,582
What do you mean?
I'm gonna use it now.

1086
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:38,416
Use it? Dizzy, give me
back the two. Thanks.

1087
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:40,478
Put it right down there.
So?

1088
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:42,387
Seven into 21?
Three times.

1089
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:45,291
Three times. Seven...
28... 13. Wait a minute!

1090
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:47,625
You ever go to school,
stupid?

1091
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:49,755
Yeah, and I come out the
same way. Never mind that.

1092
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:52,266
Multiply this.
Put down 13 up there.

1093
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:54,393
Put down 13?
Yes.

1094
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:56,938
You claim each officer
gets 13 doughnuts?

1095
01:07:57,006 --> 01:07:58,997
They gotta, or else I go
to the brig. Wait a minute.

1096
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:02,408
Seven officers? Put
down seven, draw a line.

1097
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:04,469
Seven times 13 is what?

1098
01:08:04,547 --> 01:08:06,139
Twenty-eight.
Prove it.

1099
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:07,773
Seven times three?
Twenty-one.

1100
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:09,442
Seven times one?
Seven.

1101
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:11,145
Seven and one!
Eight.

1102
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:12,778
Two?
Oh, no. Come on.

1103
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:15,119
Comes out right all the time. It shouldn't!

1104
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:18,183
It's got to come out right or
I go in the brig. That I know.

1105
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:22,219
Just a minute. We'll add this up.
Put down 13 seven times.

1106
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:24,266
That'll straighten
this out.

1107
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:28,292
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

1108
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:30,429
Wait a minute.
I forgot Dynamite.

1109
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:32,838
Yes, there's
seven officers.

1110
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:35,934
Now we're getting it. You claim
all this added up amounts to what?

1111
01:08:36,011 --> 01:08:37,945
Twenty-eight.
Give me the chalk.

1112
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:40,106
No. You take it, it's liable
to come out right.

1113
01:08:40,182 --> 01:08:43,743
Sure there's something wrong. Here's
three, six, nine, 12, 15, 18, 21.

1114
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:46,515
22, 23, 24, 25,
26, 27, 28!

1115
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:48,523
See?

1116
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:51,617
<i>All hands on deck for
the visitor's day entertainment.</i>

1117
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:56,427
<i>I'll be right there.
All hands on deck.</i>

1118
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:03,666
You wish to check
the captain's breakfast?

1119
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:06,765
I certainly do. I want to check the
captain's breakfast every morning.

1120
01:09:06,842 --> 01:09:09,811
I gotta. What is this...
a burnt offering?

1121
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:12,575
I scorch more right away.
You've scorched enough.

1122
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:15,446
Do you toast this with a
blowtorch? I don't like it.

1123
01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:17,452
I don't know how the captain
puts up with you.

1124
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,988
I'll bring it up
to him myself.

1125
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:23,115
Put your hat on before you get
into trouble. Listen to my idea.

1126
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:25,626
I'm in a hurry.
This is visitor's day.

1127
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:28,356
But it's doomsday for me.
What kind of crack is that?

1128
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:32,332
You know what I'm talking about. Today there's
gonna be hundreds of people on board this boat.

1129
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:36,360
I know that. There's gonna be
entertainment, dancing, maybe the rumba.

1130
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:38,770
So? Everybody'll have a good time but me.

1131
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:42,504
Why? Patty Andrews is comin'
on board with her sisters.

1132
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:46,412
When she finds out that I'm nothing but a
baker, I hate to think what's gonna happen.

1133
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:48,677
I told you I was
working on that.

1134
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:50,685
You've been telling me that
for two weeks.

1135
01:09:50,753 --> 01:09:53,187
I straightened out that Tommy
and Dorothy affair! I helped ya.

1136
01:09:53,255 --> 01:09:55,621
Yes, but I'm gonna
straighten out yours. How?

1137
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:58,489
How would you like
to go to sick bay?

1138
01:09:58,561 --> 01:10:01,121
Look, sick bay or Dead Sea,
it's all the same to me.

1139
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:03,893
Nothing's gonna help.
This will.

1140
01:10:03,966 --> 01:10:05,900
You report
to the hospital.

1141
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:08,334
A baker in pajamas looks
just like an admiral.

1142
01:10:08,404 --> 01:10:10,702
Oh, that's a swell idea.
Certainly!

1143
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:12,798
It ain't gonna work. These
doctors are terrific. Why not?

1144
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:15,639
They'll know there's nothing
wrong with me. They always do.

1145
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:18,009
There will be something wrong
with you after you drink that.

1146
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,241
What's that?
A sleeping solution.

1147
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:23,547
One teaspoonful and you
pass out just like that.

1148
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:25,553
Like that?
Just like that!

1149
01:10:25,621 --> 01:10:27,555
I do get to wake up?
Certainly.

1150
01:10:27,623 --> 01:10:29,557
Okay.

1151
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:31,820
For you, Patty.

1152
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:35,591
Not now! Take the captain's
breakfast to him first.

1153
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:38,565
I've got to take the captain's
breakfast first. Go ahead.

1154
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:42,365
Smokey, you're wonderful.
You embarrass me.

1155
01:10:42,438 --> 01:10:45,874
There's still work to be done.
I'll be seeing you.

1156
01:10:45,941 --> 01:10:48,273
There's a pal
if I ever did see one.

1157
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:50,209
Now, for the captain's breakfast.

1158
01:11:02,024 --> 01:11:03,958
Oh, there you are.

1159
01:11:04,026 --> 01:11:07,393
Captain wants
to meet you.

1160
01:11:07,463 --> 01:11:09,829
This orange juice
is great stuff.

1161
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:19,305
They sent me down to fix the
old man's communicator. Okay.

1162
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:21,969
<i>Come in.</i>

1163
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:25,810
<i>Smokey, the captain's asleep.</i>

1164
01:11:27,716 --> 01:11:29,946
He is asleep.
Must be overworked.

1165
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:33,318
Drank a whole glass of orange juice.
Went to sleep just like that.

1166
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:35,949
Like that?
Just like that.

1167
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:41,963
Shh. Why, you dope!
You've doped the captain.

1168
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:44,226
Yeah. Who?
You.

1169
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:47,360
I didn't dope nobody. Are
you crazy? Somebody did.

1170
01:11:47,436 --> 01:11:50,166
We'd better call the police.
Call somebody! What do you mean?

1171
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:52,935
Don't get excited.
Call somebody!

1172
01:11:53,008 --> 01:11:54,600
Take it easy. Calling the
police. Calling all cars.

1173
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:58,044
The captain's been doped.
That thing's out of order.

1174
01:11:58,113 --> 01:12:00,343
This thing's out of order.
No use talking to you.

1175
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:03,180
Put that down. That's what
Dynamite sent me down here to fix.

1176
01:12:03,252 --> 01:12:05,186
I know, but the captain.
Wait a minute.

1177
01:12:05,254 --> 01:12:08,553
Wait a minute.
I've got an idea.

1178
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:19,457
I've just made you the captain. Good.

1179
01:12:19,535 --> 01:12:21,469
I'm the captain.

1180
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:27,200
Could you tell us
where we could find...

1181
01:12:27,276 --> 01:12:29,301
<i>Girls.
Pardon us, please.</i>

1182
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:31,471
<i>Hello, Smokey.
How are you, girls?</i>

1183
01:12:31,547 --> 01:12:36,382
I've got orders to take you
to the captain's quarters.

1184
01:12:36,452 --> 01:12:38,386
The captain's quarters?
Well!

1185
01:12:38,454 --> 01:12:40,388
The captain?
Yep. Come on.

1186
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:43,391
We don't know the captain.
Is he expecting us?

1187
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:45,723
Oh, uh, these are guests
of the captain.

1188
01:12:45,794 --> 01:12:47,887
All right.
Go right in.

1189
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:56,470
<i>Welcome, girls.</i>

1190
01:13:04,947 --> 01:13:07,916
Captain Pomeroy Watson
at your service, miladies.

1191
01:13:07,983 --> 01:13:11,146
Is this on the level?
Won't you be seated?

1192
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:14,348
Thank you. It's very
comfortable here.

1193
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:17,915
You must enjoy your quarters.
Money means nothing to me.

1194
01:13:17,993 --> 01:13:21,258
Be seated, please.
I have duties to arrange.

1195
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:23,264
Ahem.

1196
01:13:23,332 --> 01:13:26,267
Running a ship
is very, very hard.

1197
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:28,633
Captain Pomeroy Watson
speaking.

1198
01:13:28,704 --> 01:13:32,401
<i>I don't want to be disturbed for
an hour... maybe two. Aye, aye, sir.</i>

1199
01:13:32,474 --> 01:13:35,875
And in the meantime, batten down all
the hatches and furl the mainsails...

1200
01:13:35,944 --> 01:13:38,572
<i>and gudgeon the pintles.
Aye, aye, sir.</i>

1201
01:13:38,647 --> 01:13:40,615
That's nautical terms.

1202
01:13:40,682 --> 01:13:43,207
You gotta talk all that
nautical stuff on a boat.

1203
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:45,913
Everything is shipshape.
Make yourself at home.

1204
01:13:45,988 --> 01:13:50,618
Captain Watson?
Call me Pomeroy, Patty.

1205
01:13:50,692 --> 01:13:53,855
Pomeroy,
I owe you an apology.

1206
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:57,126
<i>Tush, tush.
That's all...</i>

1207
01:13:59,034 --> 01:14:01,127
Somebody's knocking
at the door.

1208
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:03,865
I'll go answer it.
Excuse me.

1209
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:06,203
<i>Yes?
Message for the captain.</i>

1210
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:08,903
That's me.

1211
01:14:08,977 --> 01:14:11,241
Message for the captain.

1212
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:13,406
Messages, messages, messages!
That's all I get all day long.

1213
01:14:13,482 --> 01:14:15,780
It's enough
to drive you crazy!

1214
01:14:15,851 --> 01:14:18,149
<i>Aren't you gonna read it?
It might be important.</i>

1215
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:22,122
Sure, Pomey.
Sure, Pomey.

1216
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:25,354
I'll find out who it's from
and see what it's all about.

1217
01:14:25,427 --> 01:14:27,361
Don't be afraid.

1218
01:14:29,398 --> 01:14:33,061
That's the only thing this is
good for, opening up letters.

1219
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:36,195
It might be
very important.

1220
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:38,205
Uh-oh.
The admiral.

1221
01:14:38,273 --> 01:14:41,140
It's important, all right. May I read it?

1222
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:45,169
I've always wanted to read
official messages. Thanks, Pomey.

1223
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:48,410
Oh, how exciting!
What does it say?

1224
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:51,976
It's from the admiral
in command, Pacific fleet,

1225
01:14:52,054 --> 01:14:55,046
to Captain Richards,
commanding U. S...

1226
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:57,751
<i>Captain Richards?
That's code.</i>

1227
01:14:57,826 --> 01:14:59,987
Richards,
that's my code name.

1228
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:02,587
Every time they send something,
it's in code.

1229
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:04,689
<i>Oh, of course.</i>

1230
01:15:04,766 --> 01:15:10,602
<i>"Committee aboard flagship question
maneuverability of battleships of Alabama class.</i>

1231
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:14,836
<i>Please provide a demonstration
at your earliest possible convenience. "</i>

1232
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:18,437
How thrilling! Can we watch
you commanding your ship?

1233
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,607
Please, Pomey.
Come on.

1234
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:24,641
It would be wonderful. We've always
wanted to see something like that. Please.

1235
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:27,348
Sure, okay.

1236
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:35,922
Captain Watson speaking.

1237
01:15:35,998 --> 01:15:38,933
<i>Order the engine room to
get up steam. Aye, aye, sir.</i>

1238
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:40,935
And stand by your post.

1239
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:44,733
Standing by, sir.

1240
01:15:44,806 --> 01:15:48,037
Adams, didn't I tell you to fix
the captain's communicator?

1241
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:50,237
I'm working on it.
Fix it later.

1242
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:53,748
I've got something
more important for you to do.

1243
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:55,783
Come on.

1244
01:16:00,756 --> 01:16:04,214
Get this heliograph together
quick as you can.

1245
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:09,496
There's something
we can fix.

1246
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:13,365
Give me a hand and we'll
splice this up. Swell.

1247
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:18,469
<i>Hey, you kids,
get away from there.!</i>

1248
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:20,633
Never mind the kids.
Just keep working.

1249
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:23,200
You don't understand.
Keep working.

1250
01:16:23,278 --> 01:16:26,475
That's fixed. Let's go find something else.

1251
01:16:26,548 --> 01:16:28,277
Here's the glass.
Thanks, Pomeroy.

1252
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:30,284
Thank you.

1253
01:16:30,352 --> 01:16:32,820
Courtesy of the captain.

1254
01:16:36,525 --> 01:16:39,494
I guess the steam's up by now.
Let's go out on deck and see.

1255
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:41,188
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

1256
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:44,460
What's the matter with you? You
can't go out there. It ain't safe.

1257
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:47,058
But the other visitors...
the deck is full of them.

1258
01:16:47,135 --> 01:16:49,729
Yeah?
I'll fix that up.

1259
01:16:49,805 --> 01:16:52,365
I'll show you
a thing or two.

1260
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:55,774
- I'm the captain. Attention, the bridge!
- Aye, aye, sir.

1261
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:58,404
Send all guests below
and clear the decks for action.

1262
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,209
Aye, aye, sir.

1263
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:06,613
The guy must be
a ventriloquist, and clever!

1264
01:17:06,688 --> 01:17:08,451
Pass the word.
All visitors below decks.

1265
01:17:08,523 --> 01:17:11,287
All hands stand by to get underway.
Clear ship for action.

1266
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:21,268
All visitors below decks. All
hands stand by to get underway.

1267
01:17:21,336 --> 01:17:23,668
<i>Clear ship for action.</i>

1268
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:33,308
Weigh the anchors.
Full speed ahead.

1269
01:17:39,521 --> 01:17:42,319
Captain Richards certainly got
his ship underway fast, Admiral.

1270
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:45,155
<i>Thank you, Senator.</i>

1271
01:17:45,227 --> 01:17:48,162
Duty calls.

1272
01:17:53,101 --> 01:17:56,366
How's the longitude?
Take course, north.

1273
01:17:56,438 --> 01:17:58,668
Northeast by northeast.

1274
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:05,071
Hey, fellows, look out!

1275
01:18:05,147 --> 01:18:08,207
- Attention, the bridge. Port the helm.
- Port the helm.

1276
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:24,391
Starboard the helm.

1277
01:18:24,466 --> 01:18:27,833
Aye, aye, sir.
Starboard the helm.

1278
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:38,573
Do something.
Port the helm.

1279
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:40,774
Aye, sir.
Port the helm.

1280
01:18:49,758 --> 01:18:53,592
Well, sir? I never saw anything
like it in my life, Admiral.

1281
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:57,394
How would like to see us
go into some real action?

1282
01:18:57,466 --> 01:18:59,559
We'd love to, Pomeroy!

1283
01:18:59,634 --> 01:19:03,070
Sure.

1284
01:19:03,138 --> 01:19:06,198
Attention, the bridge. Man
battle stations. Launch aircraft.

1285
01:19:06,274 --> 01:19:08,572
Prepare torpedoes.
All guns, load.

1286
01:19:08,643 --> 01:19:11,771
Proceed under forced draft.
Course, due south.

1287
01:19:28,063 --> 01:19:31,624
Did you notice the way Richards
launched his planes? Incredible!

1288
01:19:45,247 --> 01:19:47,078
Looks like he's heading
straight for us.

1289
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:50,243
Don't worry. Richards is one
of our most able officers.

1290
01:19:50,318 --> 01:19:53,810
- Bridge calling the captain.
- What do you want?

1291
01:19:53,889 --> 01:19:57,916
My respects for the captain, but we're heading
directly for the flagship at full speed.

1292
01:19:57,993 --> 01:19:59,961
Who's running this boat?
You are, sir.

1293
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:03,464
I'll run it. You obey orders.
Do as you're told. Aye, aye, sir.

1294
01:20:32,394 --> 01:20:35,363
Attention, the bridge.
Full speed astern.

1295
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:39,628
- We're going full speed ahead.
- Don't argue! Full speed astern.

1296
01:20:39,701 --> 01:20:42,363
<i>Aye, aye, sir. Full speed
astern. Aye, aye, sir.</i>

1297
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:55,873
Full speed... Full speed astern!
Full speed astern!

1298
01:20:55,951 --> 01:20:58,818
Look out! Look out! We're
gonna get hit. Pomeroy.

1299
01:20:58,887 --> 01:21:02,823
Turn the boat! Turn the boat! Pomeroy.

1300
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:04,859
Man overboard! Man overboard! Pomeroy.

1301
01:21:04,926 --> 01:21:07,895
All right.
Pull yourself together.

1302
01:21:07,963 --> 01:21:11,126
Man overboard. Szzz!
What happened?

1303
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:14,794
Oh, boy! All right. Come out of it.

1304
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,997
It's Smokey.
Yes, I'm here.

1305
01:21:17,072 --> 01:21:19,370
Did you see it? Torpedo. Szzz. What?

1306
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:21,375
Airplane!
Everything's all right.

1307
01:21:21,443 --> 01:21:24,469
Come here.
Don't worry.

1308
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:26,980
Come here. Pull yourself together. Smokey!

1309
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:29,881
What's wrong with you?
The boat's sinking!

1310
01:21:29,951 --> 01:21:32,215
Here, here. Come on.

1311
01:21:32,287 --> 01:21:35,415
I'm gonna hit the flagship.
Here, here.

1312
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:38,391
What's the matter? Why, you
dope. You doped yourself.

1313
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:41,020
Sure! Who?
You did.

1314
01:21:41,096 --> 01:21:43,428
Ah, come on.
Get it together.

1315
01:21:43,498 --> 01:21:46,592
Fix yourself up. Get ready
for the entertainment tonight.

1316
01:21:46,668 --> 01:21:48,829
I've just had enough
entertainment for a lifetime.

1317
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:51,930
Lifeboats, boats,
airplanes, torpedoes...

1318
01:21:56,645 --> 01:21:59,341
For the hundredth time,
Mr. Russ Raymond, I...

1319
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:01,405
The name is Tommy Halstead. Whatever it is!

1320
01:22:01,483 --> 01:22:03,417
My boss promised to
destroy the negative.

1321
01:22:03,485 --> 01:22:06,045
He double-crossed you,
not me. Yes, of course.

1322
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:08,919
Very well, don't believe me.
I don't and I won't.

1323
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:11,356
All I know is, that due to
your clever camera work,

1324
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:14,259
I'm back in the spot I joined
the navy to get away from.

1325
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:17,423
If I got you out of that spot,
would you forgive me?

1326
01:22:17,499 --> 01:22:19,433
Sure.
All right.

1327
01:22:19,501 --> 01:22:21,594
Those women are only
running after you because...

1328
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:24,104
they think there's one chance
in a million to land you.

1329
01:22:24,172 --> 01:22:26,800
Cut the odds down to nothing.
What do you mean?

1330
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:30,777
They won't run after
a married man, Mr. Stupid!

1331
01:22:30,845 --> 01:22:33,575
Oh, I see.
Do you?

1332
01:22:33,648 --> 01:22:37,084
Where do you think
you're going... Mrs. Stupid?

1333
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,880
Next time, take a picture
of the good side of my face.

1334
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:45,393
<i>Star light
Star bright</i>

1335
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:49,089
<i>First star I've seen tonight</i>

1336
01:22:49,164 --> 01:22:54,033
Wish I may
Wish I might

1337
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:57,128
<i>Have the wish
I make tonight</i>

1338
01:22:57,205 --> 01:23:01,642
<i>Star light
Star bright</i>

1339
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:05,669
<i>Send me my love tonight</i>

1340
01:23:05,747 --> 01:23:08,978
<i>If you will, if you do</i>

1341
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:12,952
<i>That's my wish come true</i>

1342
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:17,185
In my mind, my ideal

1343
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:21,024
Is a creature so supreme

1344
01:23:21,096 --> 01:23:25,533
Let me find that she's real

1345
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:29,866
And not just a lovely dream

1346
01:23:29,938 --> 01:23:34,898
<i>Star light
Star bright</i>

1347
01:23:34,976 --> 01:23:39,242
<i>First star I've seen tonight</i>

1348
01:23:39,314 --> 01:23:42,841
Find my love so I might

1349
01:23:42,917 --> 01:23:49,322
Hold her in my arms tonight

1350
01:23:53,094 --> 01:23:55,085
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1351
01:23:55,163 --> 01:23:57,723
would you kindly embark
in the boats waiting for you?

1352
01:23:57,799 --> 01:24:00,290
<i>Thank you.</i>

1353
01:24:01,736 --> 01:24:05,069
We're in the navy

1354
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:08,166
Watchdogs of liberty

1355
01:24:08,243 --> 01:24:11,701
We're in the navy

1356
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:15,113
Scrappy, happy-go-lucky
sons of the sea

1357
01:24:15,183 --> 01:24:18,516
First in line
and set to clear the deck

1358
01:24:18,586 --> 01:24:21,783
Any galoot who wants a dispute
will get it in the neck

1359
01:24:21,856 --> 01:24:25,883
So, gangway
Don't cross our bow

1360
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:28,952
We're in the navy now

1361
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:32,557
We're in the navy

1362
01:24:32,634 --> 01:24:36,070
Watchdogs of liberty

1363
01:24:36,137 --> 01:24:39,265
<i>We're in the navy</i>

1364
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:43,071
<i>Scrappy, happy-go-lucky
sons of the sea</i>

1365
01:24:43,144 --> 01:24:46,443
First in line
and set to clear the deck

1366
01:24:46,514 --> 01:24:49,881
Any galoot who wants a dispute
will get it in the neck

1367
01:24:49,951 --> 01:24:53,079
So, gangway
Don't cross our bow

1368
01:24:53,154 --> 01:25:00,390
We're in the navy now

1369
01:25:01,629 --> 01:25:03,790
I'll bet you thought
it was gonna go off.
