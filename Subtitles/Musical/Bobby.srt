1
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,560 
- I did it in fun.
- Is he of your age?

2
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,560 
Nobody's of my age here.

3
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,880 
He's being a pest!
Keep him with you. Go now!

4
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,360 
- You forgot me, eh?
- How can anyone forgetyou?

5
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:09,200 
You don't look a mother of a six
year old boy. You look sweet 16!

6
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,720 
This is your son, right?
My dear darlingchild...

7
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,320 
Now give a kiss to Aunty.
Come on.

8
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,040 
He bit me!

9
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,080 
Haven't you taught him
any manners or etiquettes?

10
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,800 
An absolute brute!

11
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,360 
Your son here, bit my cheek!
He should be thrown out!

12
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,760 
Send him to a Reform-school.

13
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,880 
- Apologise!
- No!

14
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,000 
What if somebody forces
you to kiss?

15
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,560 
Hey! He's just a kid.
Does one hit a kid like this?

16
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,280 
- Shut up! Is this your upbringing?
- Hush! I didn't teach him to be rude.

17
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,040 
- A kid's conduct is a mother's job.
- When have you let me be a mother?

18
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,880 
Two woolens coats.

19
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,240 
6 vests.

20
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,880 
6 underwears.

21
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,360 
3 coloured jerseys.

22
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,440 
Convince the Master, Madam.
How will he stay without his parents?

23
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,680 
Didn't you think of this before?
We trusted you with him...

24
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,880 
...and he got spoilt.
We never realised that you...

25
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,880 
...that you're a servant here,
and not his mother.

26
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,040 
I may not be his mother,
but I was like a mother to him.

27
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,800 
And if that's the case,
excuse me for being blunt...

28
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,640 
But you didn't even breast-feed him.
Are you a mother?

29
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,320 
Today I'm really very happy,
but very sad too.

30
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:13,040 
Sad because you've been with me for
so many years, and I love you all.

31
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,520 
But today, my heart is
heavy to bid you goodbye.

32
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,280 
I'm also glad to see you all step
in this world in the real sense.

33
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,320 
From today your life is your own.
I'll remind you once more...

34
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,120 
...that you've to find your ways
and your goals, yourself.

35
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,960 
Take your decisions, yourself.
Believe me...

36
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,000 
...success is simply impatient
to come to you.

37
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,520 
What's your programme?
Staying back for the function?

38
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,080 
I want to and I've sought my
parent's permission. Let's see.

39
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,240 
There's our principal who tells
us to take our own decisions...

40
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,480 
...and here's Mama's boy, who has
to seek permission to enjoy them?

41
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,600 
These are our fun days.
Why seek permission to enjoy them?

42
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,360 
You're very late. How was the party?
- Very nice.

43
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,760 
- Are you staying up for me?
- No. I had some work to finish.

44
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,640 
Go and sleep.
I'll come later.

45
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,480 
There are some letters for you
on the table. Take them.

46
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,040 
- It's from Raja.
- What says he?

47
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,840 
That his papers have gone well.

48
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,400 
And asks, "Can I stay back for
our farewell function on the 24th?"

49
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,760 
24th? When is his birthday?

50
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,440 
- On the 23rd.
- 23rd? Then how can he stay back?

51
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,480 
No. I'm going to celebrate
his birthday very grandly.

52
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,520 
It's a good excuse to invite
my clients and business friends.

53
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,040 
Also, he'll come to know the ropes
by socialising with people here.

54
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,520 
Inform him to come
back immediately.

55
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,680 
Well, Mama's boy...
All packed and ready to go, eh?

56
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,600 
Yes. My parents wish that
I reach home by the 23rd.

57
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,440 
- It's my birthday.
- Really?

58
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,160 
How old will you be?
- 18!

59
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,600 
Don't be funny.
You still have your milk-teeth!

60
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,800 
- I'm doing some work.
- Must be penning a poem.

61
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,880 
People go out in the evenings to
seek a muse for their poetry.

62
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:26,800 
And this guy here...
Come, I'll show you something.

63
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,120 
To hell with you!
I've brought a poetry in motion!

64
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,240 
One look, and you'll pen
ten odes to her!

65
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,560 
I'll burn that diary of yours!
Can't you spare me a moment?

66
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,840 
Come on.

67
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,160 
Look towards the gate.

68
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,840 
- There's a limit to...
- Listen, will you?

69
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,640 
Cool it. You've your whole life
to pen poetry. But a girl like...

70
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,280 
Aren't you ashamed?
What if your parents find out?

71
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,240 
Don't get worked up now.
Are our parents losing sleep over us?

72
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,640 
I tell the truth, that's why
people get disturbed.

73
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,120 
Tell me the truth. Do you
love your parents? Be honest.

74
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,840 
I don't lie!

75
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,640 
Shall I tell you? You don't love
them, because they don't love you!

76
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:46,480 
Love begets love. They had you,
and then dumped you here!

77
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,040 
Who has the time nowadays to
hold their kids to their hearts?

78
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,440 
The world is moving fast, and,
we all have to keep up with it.

79
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,040 
I want to be with the world.

80
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,520 
I must find a friend a, who
won't ditch me when eed arises.

81
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,880 
- I'm home.
- Hello, sir.

82
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,040 
Where's my Mummy?

83
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,320 
She had a meeting to attend.
She asked me to look after you.

84
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,720 
- And Daddy must be in his office.
- Yes, sir.

85
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,560 
Bless you. How you've grown!
A chip of the old block!

86
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,560 
Happy? I was worried that the party
is tomorrow and still no sign of you.

87
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,920 
- Thought we'd have to cancel it.
- That would've been a problem.

88
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,800 
Okay son, I'll go now.
I've some important work pending.

89
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,360 
Listen, I too left the meeting
half way. They'll wait for me.

90
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,440 
- I'm late as it is.
- Come along then.

91
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,760 
Okay, take a wash and have lunch.
See you in the evening.

92
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,320 
And if you need anything,
beckon Ramdhin.

93
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,840 
Love begets love. They had
you and dumped you here!

94
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,680 
Who has the time nowadays to
clasp their kids to their bosoms?

95
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,480 
- You're all dolled-up.
- Why?

96
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,560 
Waiting for someone, eh?

97
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,400 
- Your son's not to be seen.
- I was about to say the same.

98
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,200 
He's a bit shy. There were
no girls in his class, you see.

99
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,360 
Please go upstairs and call him.
I've to attend to my guests.

100
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,480 
- Which room?
- The one on your right.

101
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,880 
- What is it?
- Nothing.

102
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,000 
- Has he bathed?
- Sure...

103
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,840 
What's all this? I'll get him.

104
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,760 
No, I'll call him myself.

105
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,640 
You're knocking my door now?
Didn't you know it earlier?

106
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,200 
I knew, but...
Well, I didn't know that...

107
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,760 
...you'd treat your home,
like your boarding school.

108
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,040 
Pass me that gown, please.

109
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,880 
Who are you and what are
you doing here?

110
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,080 
I'm Neema.

111
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,480 
I'm a dancer and
run a dancing school.

112
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,360 
- I'm your mom's Bridge partner too.
- My mom, and the party's downstairs.

113
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,160 
I know. Your mom has called
you downstairs immediately.

114
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,320 
At once? Like this?
You go ahead. I'll come later.

115
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,120 
Wait here.
I'll just come.

116
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,840 
Excuse me for coming uninvited.
Congratulations for today.

117
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,480 
Raj, I've baked a cake for Raja.
A sponge cake. His favourite.

118
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,800 
Take this from her.

119
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,080 
- Happy Birthday, Sonny.
- Congratulations.

120
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,400 
Congratulations...
Happy birthday.

121
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,240 
Now come along.
Give a kiss to your Aunty.

122
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,960 
Hold on. You won't
bite my cheek, will you?

123
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,160 
Why are you gaping at him?
When you were a kid...

124
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,520 
you had bitten my cheek.
And I had screamed...

125
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,680 
Help! He bit my cheek.

126
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,120 
He's not a kid any more.
Just gave his Senior Cambridge.

127
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,280 
Is that so? Then it's okay.
Come along then. Give me a kiss.

128
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,560 
Naughty boy! Anyway...
It's okay you did it to me.

129
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:39,080 
But don't try it on a girl, else,
she'll give you a sound beating.

130
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,240 
I won't beat you!

131
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,520 
I know a secret about Raj...

132
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:07,000 
which is not known by anybody.
And I'm happy to share with you all.

133
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:13,040 
And the secret is that Raj doesn't
just have a beautiful body...

134
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:18,000 
- What are you doing?
...but a wonderful heart too.

135
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:24,360 
And this is proved by the fact
that Raj is a good poet...

136
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,720 
...and pens lovely poems.
On all your behalf...

137
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:33,880 
I now request him to recite
a song, a poem, a couplet...

138
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,080 
No... I don't know any poem.
I've never penned any couplet...

139
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,800 
- Have you taken over my life?
- Recite or sing it.

140
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,760 
If I say I can't sing,
You'll get some proof that I can!

141
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,120 
- You mean you can sing too?
- Yes. He sings and I dance.

142
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,360 
"I'm no poet"

143
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,840 
"I'm no poet"

144
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,160 
"But my pretty one..."

145
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:07,000 
"ever since I have seen you..."

146
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,400 
"poetry has just come to me"

147
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,240 
"I'm no lover either"

148
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,200 
"But dear lovely one..."

149
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,200 
"ever since I set eyes on you..."

150
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,000 
"I've become a lover"

151
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,280 
"I'm no poet"

152
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,960 
"I had heard of love, no doubt"

153
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,200 
"But I didn't know
what it was"

154
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,800 
"I remained confused
as confusions generally are..."

155
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,080 
"and remained an enemy
in friends"

156
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,440 
"But I'm no foe..."

157
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,200 
"but dear pretty one..."

158
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,560 
"having seen you..."

159
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:12,920 
"I have learnt to make friends"

160
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,160 
"I'm no poet"

161
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,000 
"Had I really prayed..."

162
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:59,240 
"and lifted my hands...
what would I have asked for?"

163
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,520 
"But ever since I've fallen
in love with you..."

164
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:19,040 
"I've begun to pray"

165
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,520 
"But I'm no atheist"

166
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,880 
"I'm no disbeliever in God"

167
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,960 
"But dear lovely one..."

168
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,880 
"Ever since I have seen you..."

169
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,360 
"I have come to believe"

170
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,240 
"I'm no poet"

171
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,440 
"But my dear pretty one..."

172
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,960 
"ever since I have set
my eyes on you..."

173
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,840 
"poetry just came to me"

174
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,600 
"I'm no poet"

175
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,160 
See? All the richie-rich had
come to celebrate your birthday.

176
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,440 
See the presents? There's no room
to keep them! Where are you going?

177
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,440 
- To bed! I'm fagged out.
- So am I.

178
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,960 
You also relax, son.

179
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,800 
The same aroma...
Exactly the same.

180
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,400 
I know Aunty,
but who's this Bobby?

181
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,720 
He has gone out, Master Raj.
What can I do for you?

182
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,720 
- Do you know where this Aunty lives?
- Which Aunty?

183
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,400 
Mrs Braganza, who was my
governess when I was a baby.

184
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,320 
I came here later. Ramdhin must
be knowing. Shall I call him?

185
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,400 
No, don't bother.
I'll find out for myself.

186
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,840 
- Who is it?
- It's me.

187
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,160 
Me? Who's me?

188
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,440 
Well?

189
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,680 
- Well, say something.
- You, and here?

190
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:35,800 
Me? Where else will I be?
But, you?

191
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,040 
Aunty...
Aunty lives here, doesn't she?

192
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,720 
- Aunty? Yours or mine?
- Mine. Mrs Braganza.

193
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,880 
- Yes, she stays here... so?
- Well... I just...

194
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,000 
What 'just'? Hurry up.
My oil's burning.

195
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,200 
Who is it?
- God knows. Some nephew of an Aunty!

196
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,520 
What do you want?
Tell me. Whom do you want?

197
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,720 
I won't. You tell me, why
didn't you meet me on my birthday?

198
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,360 
Raja? My darling child?!

199
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,280 
Such a small bundle of joy
grew up to be so big? Bend down.

200
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,880 
I can't see you properly.
Dear Lord...

201
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,640 
Save him from my evil eye.

202
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,000 
A mother never looks at her kids
with an evil eye, Aunty.

203
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:45,240 
You call me Aunty and mother in
one breath, eh? Sit down now.

204
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,760 
- I had left a cake for you. Eat it?
- That's why I ran here for more.

205
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,560 
- Is there any left?
- Of course.

206
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,240 
You mean you came for my cake?

207
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,680 
But of course.
To eat the cake, and...

208
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,840 
...and, make friends with
your son, Bobby.

209
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:14,640 
My son? He's of your Dad's age.
His name is Jack. And Bobby...

210
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,480 
Want to be friends with me?

211
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,000 
- A bin!
- What?

212
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:37,520 
Nothing. There's a fat girl in
our class. We call her a "Bin".

213
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,880 
Actually her name is Jyoti.
Like yours is Raja.

214
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,520 
- Be polite. Call him Master Raja.
- It's all the same, Gran.

215
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,320 
- Isn't it?
- Yes, yes it is.

216
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,640 
She's very naughty.
She's always asking about you.

217
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000 
Who? Where? How?

218
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,600 
And that cake I made for you...
She signed her name on that too!

219
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,600 
- Yes, I had seen it.
- Do you still draw?

220
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:13,160 
Gran says you had used a man's
black coat as a black board once.

221
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,080 
You had drawn a big figure on it.

222
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,960 
There was a woman...
What was her name?

223
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:29,600 
- Do you remember biting her?
- Yes, and she had screamed...

224
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,800 
No wonder you were
punished so severely!

225
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,920 
- Punished?
- Yes. Your Daddy thought...

226
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,320 
you unfit to stay at home.

227
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,040 
- So he sent you to a boarding.
- What nonsense, Bobby.

228
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,000 
Don't listen to her, son.
She just blabbers.

229
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,640 
Is this true?

230
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,840 
- Why you haven't eaten any cake.
- Don't avoid the issue.

231
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,080 
Was I sent to the boarding school
as a punishment?

232
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,040 
Yes, son.
I tried my best to stop them.

233
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,680 
But I was a servant after all.
Nobody listened to me.

234
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,280 
Anyway, today you've become
such a smart boy.

235
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,400 
Makes you happy, doesn't it?

236
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,680 
Listen, won't you have tea?

237
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,880 
What for?

238
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,680 
You told me something I didn't know.

239
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,920 
- Okay then, I'll go now.
- How long will you be in London?

240
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,400 
It's a business trip, so I'll be
away for at least 2-3 weeks.

241
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,480 
That reminds me, I've decided
to send Raja to zzzLondon too.

242
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,040 
- What are you punishing me for now?
- Punishing you?

243
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,720 
Yes.

244
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,800 
I've heard that I was sent to the
Boarding School as a punishment.

245
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,360 
- Who told you?
- Aunty Mrs Braganza.

246
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,160 
- Is it a lie?
- So! You've begun...

247
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,000 
to sit with the servants already.

248
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,760 
She's not a servant, I look
up to her as a mother.

249
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,280 
You didn't bring me up.
She did!

250
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,000 
Hear that?

251
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,680 
A bin!

252
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,480 
Our books got exchanged.

253
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,440 
Yes. My book has a cover just
like this one, you see.

254
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,240 
My book, stupid.

255
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,680 
Will you get lost now?
Only members are allowed here.

256
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:57,280 
- Then make me a member too.
- People come here to study, not chat.

257
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,960 
Then where does one go to chat?

258
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,880 
- Outside the library.
- Then come on outside.

259
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,360 
- Why did you flash a mirror?
- You weren't getting up, that's why.

260
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,080 
- Do nice boys do such a thing?
- Am I a nice oy then?

261
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,520 
- No, a very bad boy!
- Okay, let's do one thing.

262
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,360 
Let's have some tea. I'm told,
hot tea, cools one down in summer.

263
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,520 
No! We'll eat some
roasted gram first.

264
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,000 
Won't you sit inside?

265
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,440 
Gran says good girls don't sit
there when out on a first date.

266
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,120 
- Why don't you say you're scared.
- What! You think I'm scared?

267
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,960 
Look at these... my teeth?
How are they?

268
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,240 
They're nice; which toothpaste
do you use?

269
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,200 
Dummy! They're sharp.

270
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,160 
They can cut a raw guava
in half, in one bite!

271
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,840 
- So?
- See these nails?

272
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,560 
They're very pointed.

273
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,720 
- So?
- Times have changed Dummy!

274
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,600 
I'm a girl of the 21st Century.

275
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,960 
- But it's still the 20th!
- That's history. I'm from the 21st!

276
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,480 
I know how to defend myself.
Nobody can touch me!

277
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,440 
- Why not?
- Let him just try it!

278
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,160 
Oh! Where did she drop here from?

279
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,240 
Let go of my hand!

280
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,160 
Hadn't you said something
about biting a cheek...

281
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,880 
What! I said something about
biting a cheek?

282
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,240 
Softly...

283
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,600 
Hadn't you told me I was punished
for having bitten a woman's cheek?

284
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,400 
- That's her out there.
- Really? I want to see her...

285
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,720 
Have pity on your Dummy.
If she sees me with you...

286
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,960 
...I'll be punished for
the rest of my life too!

287
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,520 
Go away! Go on.

288
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,400 
- Lift your legs.
- What!

289
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,920 
My goodness!

290
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,760 
Why should I lift my legs up?
I'm not scared. I'm leaving!

291
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,040 
Listen...
Listen to me Bobby.

292
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,520 
You! Mr Nath's son?

293
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,520 
- Who was that girl?
- Which girl?

294
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,880 
- The one that left just now.
- Can't recall.

295
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,480 
Just went up.

296
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,400 
- Towards the beach.
- She's...

297
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,200 
Go and enjoy yourself then.
Go on...

298
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,760 
- Well, see how I fooled you?
- You're great Bobby.

299
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,160 
- I've never seen a girl like you.
- How many girls do you know then?

300
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,280 
Me? Hundreds of them.

301
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:04,200 
Well, if not hundreds, I know
at least a dozen very well.

302
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,960 
Actually... I know just one.

303
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,480 
You, Bobby.

304
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,520 
You, and here?

305
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,800 
Why did you run away while playing?
Because you saw me?

306
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,760 
Shall I tell you the truth,
or make some excuse?

307
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:40,880 
- Those who lie are bitten by a crow.
- Then I better tell you the truth!

308
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,160 
Do you know why I ran away
from the badminton court?

309
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,360 
Why?

310
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,600 
I got nervous when I saw you.

311
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,680 
This heart...
It is on the left side, isn't it?

312
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,640 
I felt as though it had come
in my throat.

313
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,320 
I got very scared.

314
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,760 
But why did you get scared?

315
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,720 
I don't know.

316
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,160 
Think, and tell me.

317
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,200 
We're being watched.

318
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:57,480 
"I want to say something.
- So do l"

319
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:03,400 
"I want to tell you something.
- So do l"

320
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,320 
"You first
- No, you first"

321
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:10,000 
"You, you, you, you...
- You, you, you you..."

322
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,280 
"Look, just like those two men,
who, by saying..."

323
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,440 
"you first", "no, you first"
had missed the train..."

324
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:27,200 
"like that, we too may miss
this beautiful season"

325
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,920 
"Okay, I'll say it"

326
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,680 
"Like any other girl
in this situation..."

327
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,360 
"would say to a boy
at the age of 16..."

328
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:49,320 
"That's what I want
to say to you"

329
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,440 
"Like any other boy
in this situation..."

330
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,720 
"would say to a girl
of 16..."

331
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,280 
"that's what I want to
say to you"

332
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:43,320 
"I can't sleep,
nor is my heart at peace..."

333
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:49,160 
"I wait for you...
I simply wait for you"

334
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,880 
"Nothing seems nice
without you..."

335
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,040 
"It all seems so false...
so untrue"

336
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,840 
"I don't feel at ease at home,
nor out anywhere"

337
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:10,520 
"I'm sitting at one place,
and lost somewhere else"

338
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:16,320 
"But not to say anything and
just keep silent... No! No!"

339
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:21,520 
"It's so difficult now
to keep silent"

340
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:28,760 
"I've to tell you something.
- So do I..."

341
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:56,640 
"I've nothing to do
the whole day..."

342
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:01,960 
"but to think of you,
or to call out to you"

343
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,600 
"All the colours in this world
seem so dull"

344
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:12,680 
"Only your words sound so sweet"

345
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:17,880 
"I live, so I can adore you"

346
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:23,080 
"I live only for your consent"

347
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:29,000 
"But not to say anything and
just keep quiet... No! No!"

348
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:34,200 
"It's difficult now
to keep silent"

349
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:41,680 
"I want to say something...
- So do l"

350
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:14,240 
"Where there are no thorns..."

351
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:19,480 
"let's go and stay there"

352
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:25,720 
"Where there is no fear
for us to meet"

353
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,960 
"Where there's no home for me,
but you, my beloved"

354
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,520 
"Is there such a place
on this earth?"

355
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:41,360 
"Let's leave the matter here,
and now..."

356
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:47,520 
"but not to say anything now,
and keep quiet... No! No!"

357
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,800 
"It's difficult now
to keep silent anymore"

358
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,200 
"Like any other girl
in such situation..."

359
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:03,320 
"would say to a boy
at the age of 16..."

360
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:10,600 
"Say to him...
- That's what I wish to say"

361
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:16,760 
"When a girl...
- When a boy..."

362
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:21,040 
"Like any other girl...
- In such a situation"

363
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,600 
Look, the boss is here.

364
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:13,000 
He's a workaholic.
Else, where's the need to?

365
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,120 
I've got first class fish.
Make good money.

366
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,600 
Right, Boss.

367
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:36,200 
Boss, my foot! I'm Jack.
You dare forget it!

368
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,600 
Shall I keep this in Papa's room?

369
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,800 
- What are you thinking about?
- I feeling very uneasy.

370
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:54,960 
- What about? Papa won't refuse.
- I don't mean Jack.

371
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,720 
- Then?
- I meant Mr Nath.

372
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,400 
He's a rich man, dear.

373
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,840 
Don't know whether he'll approve
of you and Raja mixing like this.

374
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:08,800 
Oh Gran! Why should he mind?
Nonsense.

375
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:27,040 
- Bobby's going to Kashmir, eh?
- No, she doesn't want to go.

376
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,120 
- Why not?
- She doesn't want to.

377
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,840 
Okay, but what's all this then?

378
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:36,560 
- Raja is coming to pick her up.
- Which Raja?

379
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:41,960 
Mr Nath's son.
He's taking her to a movie.

380
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,040 
He is coming to take
permission of you.

381
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:52,040 
That wee thing has become big
enough to date my Bobby?

382
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,280 
- You don't mind, do you?
- Does he want permission, or you?

383
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:03,560 
- I've pressed your suit for you.
- Suit? What for?

384
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:05,960 
What's the occasion?

385
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:14,880 
You know I wear a suit only twice.
For weddings and funerals. Why now?

386
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:18,480 
You'll look very nice, won't you,
wearing that in Raja's presence!

387
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,560 
I see.
He's a rich man's son, eh?

388
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:29,360 
Can't wear this in front of him, eh?
These are my working clothes.

389
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:33,760 
I work, so I earn and keep
the hearth burning!

390
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,040 
He'll feel ashamed to see me
in these clothes, eh?

391
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,760 
And you'll go to a movie
with my permission? No!

392
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,080 
I told you I won't come.
Don't worry.

393
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,920 
Your dad's away.

394
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,680 
If I go away too, you'll be
all alone and get bored here.

395
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,160 
- Come with me.
- No, Mom.

396
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:02,560 
You go. I'll prepare for college.

397
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,400 
I was coming to see you,
and you're running away?

398
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,640 
I've some important work.

399
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,600 
Promise. You'll come and
I'll let you go.

400
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,600 
- What's the occasion?
- A party.

401
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,000 
You'll come, won't you?

402
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,560 
- Yes he will.
- Oh, Mom...

403
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,200 
Master Raja?
Come in. Sit down.

404
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,800 
Bobby, Master Raja's here.

405
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,400 
- He's here, Jack.
- I heard.

406
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,280 
This is Master Raja.

407
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,040 
Get a glass, Mom.

408
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,680 
Want to say something to me?

409
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,400 
- Well... I want to see a movie.
- Go ahead.

410
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:23,480 
- Well I... Aunty...
- Talking to her, or me?

411
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:31,360 
I'm talking to you, sir.
If you allow me to...

412
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:36,480 
...I'd like... Aunty... I'd like
to take Aunty to the movies!

413
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,160 
You'll take my Mom out
to the movies?

414
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,640 
No sir.
What I meant was...

415
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:52,000 
I'd like to take Bobby out.
If you permit me, of course.

416
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:03,160 
- No, you may not!
- Why not papa.

417
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:08,680 
Because if he takes you out,
he'll show you a movie, dine out.

418
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,360 
Spend money. Right?

419
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:16,120 
That's why I'm against it.
Understand?

420
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,360 
If you want to date her...

421
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:22,360 
you'll go Dutch.

422
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:27,920 
- That's not necessary, son.
- It is, Mom.

423
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:33,760 
Look Mom, you worked
in his house. Fine.

424
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:39,840 
But I didn't. If he's rich, fine.
I've my place too.

425
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:48,840 
I've collected enough money
for my daughter's happiness.

426
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,960 
- Why discuss all this?
- No need.

427
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,800 
Give us a kiss, dear.

428
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:04,480 
You'll both share the cost.
Accounts must be clear.

429
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:08,280 
See that he doesn't cheat you.
Understand?

430
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,800 
- I can read.
- So?

431
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,680 
So, we go back home.

432
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:49,320 
I've taken your Dada's permission.
Do we go back without enjoying?

433
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:54,400 
- What do you mean?
- Sit. We'll go to a party.

434
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:26,040 
- I'm finding this all weird.
- Aren't you a 21st century girl?

435
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,400 
This is common in a party.

436
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,440 
- Come, let's dance.
- No...

437
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,040 
We'll meet again then.

438
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,240 
- Didn't recognise me?
- No.

439
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,440 
I'm Chanda. Your B-day party...

440
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:59,280 
You're looking all lost.
Looking for Neema?

441
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,760 
- Yes, can't see her.
- Must be around here.

442
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,720 
Where were you all this time?
I was waiting so eagerly for you.

443
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,400 
Where did you pick up such
a lovely girl?

444
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,600 
She's Bobby.

445
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,840 
- Who asked her name?
- I told you myself.

446
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:29,080 
Anyway... I can't bear to see you
with somebody else tonight.

447
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,360 
Come.

448
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,360 
Standing all alone at
this beautiful moment?

449
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,600 
Great style, beloved!

450
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,360 
- One coke...
- Why not champagne?

451
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:53,040 
Shut up! Be polite.

452
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:59,600 
Polite, eh? It's an insult if one
doesn't tease a beautiful girl.

453
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,800 
But I'm not impolite either.

454
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,920 
- Looking out for Raja?
- Do you know him?

455
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:13,400 
Very well. We were together
in the hostel. One scotch, please.

456
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:19,480 
I used to lure many girls...
And him! Old Scrooge! Miser!

457
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:24,880 
But how much has he given you?
I can offer you much more.

458
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:31,840 
Will you come with me tonight?
You dare do this?

459
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:37,400 
- Let go! I'm not of that sort.
- If not, then why are you here?

460
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,560 
- Didn't he tell you before?
- He didn't know it himself!

461
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:46,960 
He knows everything. One comes here
with one, and leaves with another.

462
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,760 
- See how he entered her bedroom?
- He's not like that.

463
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,080 
Come and see.

464
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:57,240 
I'm up to my gills in love.
And...

465
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:01,400 
And I don't want to come out.
I want to sink deeper in it.

466
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:07,360 
I'm telling you the truth.
I want to marry.

467
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:15,360 
Why bring marriage into this?
It's all nonsense.

468
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:19,960 
And I'm much older than you.
How can you marry me?

469
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,320 
But yes, we could be lovers.

470
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:39,000 
You're mistaken, I meant Bobby.
I love her very much.

471
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,360 
I want to marry her.

472
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:06,640 
How dare you behave so cheaply
with an innocent girl like that?

473
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:11,000 
What I do is cheap and when you
take him to your room is morality!

474
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:37,200 
- You're back, my dear?
- Yes, Gran.

475
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:41,120 
So soon? It was well, wasn't it?

476
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:43,200 
Yes, Gran.
It was just fine.

477
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:32,040 
Didn't you go to leave Bobby
at the station?

478
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,360 
- To Leave Bobby?
- Yes, she's gone to Kashmir.

479
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,240 
But she had said she won't
be going.

480
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,600 
I don't know.
Last night she said...

481
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:48,920 
she wanted to go.
The train leaves at noon.

482
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:51,960 
- How will you reach the station?
- I'll reach.

483
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:56,680 
Be careful, son.
You may fall.

484
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:16,080 
Don't be angry with me.
It wasn't my fault. Please...

485
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:34,760 
Listen to me.

486
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:43,480 
Tell me, what's the matter?
At least tell me what I've done!

487
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:47,920 
You've played with my feelings.
You're rich...

488
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:52,640 
For you love may be a game,
But I wasn't from your lot.

489
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,640 
Why did you do this?
Why?

490
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,640 
Don't touch me!

491
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:06,480 
Let go of my hand!

492
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,840 
Let go of my hand, I say!

493
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:15,400 
- What happened, dear?
- Nothing...

494
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:22,040 
He has teased her!
She was yelling "Let me go!"

495
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:37,080 
Eve-teaser, eh?
Shameless being!

496
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:42,200 
You manhandle a guest?
Rascal! Cad! Tease a girl?

497
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,840 
You cur!

498
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,040 
How did you come here?

499
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:00,040 
Shameless rascal! Cur!
Don't ever come here. Get lost!

500
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:04,920 
"Break down temples and mosques,
if you wish"

501
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:11,320 
"So says the Sufi Saint Buleshah"

502
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:34,640 
"But do not break a heart
full of love..."

503
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:40,520 
"for it is the heart
in which the beloved lives"

504
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:50,600 
"The scales in which you
have weighed love..."

505
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:54,760 
"the scales in which you have
weighed your love..."

506
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:59,600 
"never weigh your
wealth in it"

507
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:03,960 
"God forbid...
I shall not talk about it"

508
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:10,200 
"I shall never..."

509
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:43,840 
"There's fire within
both concerned"

510
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:50,560 
"But fire can be doused
with water"

511
01:12:52,040 --> 01:13:04,680 
"But when tears flowed
down the beloved's cheeks..."

512
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:10,320 
"it fanned the fires even more"

513
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:19,320 
"I'd rather sit in front
of you and cry..."

514
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:27,640 
"I sat and cried in front of you.
But didn't express my sorrow"

515
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:39,120 
"No, I won't open my mouth!
Not say a word"

516
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:49,600 
"God forbid...
I won't say a word"

517
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:55,840 
"I won't say a word"

518
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:00,040 
"I too won't say anything"

519
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:05,640 
"No, not a word"

520
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:42,480 
- Madam, this horse is frisky.
- Then I won't ride it!

521
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,400 
This horse is very temperamental.
If you're a good...

522
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:47,840 
I know!

523
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:18,960 
Bobby!
Stop, Bobby.

524
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,040 
Stop!

525
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:59,080 
- I want to die.
- Open your eyes... you're okay?

526
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:02,920 
I don't want to live.
I don't wish to come in your way.

527
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:05,960 
You are my way, and,
my destination too!

528
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,920 
Liar!

529
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:11,560 
If I hadn't seen with my own eyes,
I'd have still fell for this line.

530
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:15,440 
I'd have believed you've never
expressed your love to anybody else.

531
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:20,760 
- But don't you want to marry Neema?
- Enough!

532
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:25,960 
I respect her. I was talking
to her about marrying you!

533
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:33,120 
But not anymore. You believed
what you saw, but...

534
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:36,760 
Did you think what would've
happened to me, had you died?

535
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:41,160 
I'd have just committed suicide,
what else?

536
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,680 
Forgive me, Raju.

537
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:55,080 
- What's this, Raju?
- Say that again.

538
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:02,000 
Nobody has called me
'Raju' before.

539
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,840 
I'll call you 'Raju'
Always...

540
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:29,400 
Nothing serious. Just
knocked out. Please help me.

541
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:35,240 
- She's lucky to be saved.
- It was a 1,000 feet drop!

542
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:39,960 
Just superficial abrasions.

543
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:49,080 
- She's still out cold however!
- Lucky that he was there, else...

544
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:53,600 
He's valiant, no doubt.
What a man!

545
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:59,040 
My pony refused to bolt! Else,
wouldn't he have saved me too?

546
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:03,920 
Had he saved me,
I'd have... just died!

547
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:11,240 
- What are you talking about?
- You! you've really obliged us.

548
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:16,080 
Not at all...
It was my duty.

549
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:24,120 
- Where am I?
- Don't panic.

550
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:26,200 
You're in your bed. Hale and hearty.

551
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:34,440 
- Who are you?
- He only saved your life.

552
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,640 
Endangering his own.

553
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:43,160 
How can I ever thank you, Mr...

554
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:47,560 
Raj Nath.
Pet name, Raju.

555
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:58,360 
- Let me see you out.
- Why do you bother?

556
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,240 
No bother.

557
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:05,880 
- Trying to be a hero to them, eh?
- You're unnecessarily...

558
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:09,200 
- What am I worth?
- Worthless!

559
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:11,640 
- I'll show you tomorrow.
- What time?

560
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,480 
- It's 12 O' clock.
- What?

561
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:15,240 
Didn't you just ask the time?

562
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:45,040 
That girl over there in red.
One in the centre.

563
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:51,280 
With long hair.
Go give her this chit.

564
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,520 
Bobby, see what I bought.

565
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:08,000 
- Your letter, Miss.
- What?

566
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:17,360 
Listen everyone, come here.
See what this says.

567
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,760 
"Meeting like this is futile. Dump
these girls and come to the club".

568
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:26,120 
This is the same boy
who saved you yesterday.

569
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:27,680 
No, can't be him.

570
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:30,600 
It's written right here.
"Yours, and only yours, Raju".

571
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,760 
He was a gentleman yesterday,
and being Romeo today, eh?

572
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:41,400 
- Such guys should be thrashed.
- Come, let's give him a hiding!

573
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:45,240 
- Forget it! Why bother?
- What do you mean?

574
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:50,440 
- Come alone, eh? Sure I will!
- Let's beat him up. You too Bobby.

575
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:53,640 
No, I can't bear to see
thrashings. You all go.

576
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:54,960 
Coward!

577
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,640 
- Come girls, let's go
- Yes, come on.

578
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,000 
There he is!

579
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:04,920 
Wait, you scoundrel!
I'll show you yet.

580
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:12,200 
- You!
- If you want to live, let's run!

581
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:58,120 
- Must be here somewhere.
- Yes. He has lured Bobby at last.

582
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:03,080 
Where will he go? He'll forget
his madness once we catch him.

583
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:09,600 
- There's nobody here.
- She's innocent.

584
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:13,360 
- We must protect her.
- Yes, let's go find them.

585
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:17,960 
- What's the matter, girls?
- A cad has kidnapped a girl.

586
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,280 
- Here? No...
- He came here.

587
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:24,600 
- I saw with my own eyes.
- Nonsense! I'm a watchman here.

588
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:31,320 
Now go along. Don't pester me.
I've to lock up now.

589
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:39,320 
What are you peering in for?
I've to go to the market.

590
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:43,000 
It takes me 3 hours, to and fro.
It'll be late when I return. Go...

591
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:53,360 
The watchman said it'll take
3 hours to come and go.

592
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,280 
Oh God! I think I'll die.

593
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:02,840 
- What will I tell my teacher?
- Your friends will tell her that!

594
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:08,280 
Don't tease me.
Think how to get out of here.

595
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:38,520 
All the doors and
windows are locked!

596
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:46,720 
What are you laughing about?
Think of something.

597
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,600 
- That's what I'm doing.
- What?

598
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:58,920 
"Nobody can come in...
from the outside"

599
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:04,280 
"Nobody can go out...
from the inside"

600
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:09,160 
"Think what would happen
in such a situation"

601
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,960 
"You and I..."

602
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:23,240 
"Both locked in a room"

603
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:29,120 
"And the key gets lost"

604
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:47,200 
"Then I too will get lost
in the charm of your eyes"

605
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:53,880 
"You and I...
both locked in a room..."

606
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,640 
"and the key gets lost"

607
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:28,960 
"It's pitch dark ahead...
- I'm very scared"

608
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:33,120 
"With a robber behind you!
- Why are you scaring me?"

609
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:36,240 
"Darkness ahead"

610
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:40,440 
"And a robber behind you"

611
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:45,640 
"You can't climb up..."

612
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:48,760 
"nor can you climb down"

613
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:57,160 
"Think what would happen
in this really happened"

614
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:00,240 
"You and I..."

615
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:06,640 
"are going somewhere"

616
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:12,680 
"And we lose our way"

617
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:28,960 
"In your loving arms, my love"

618
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:32,880 
"I'll swing to and fro"

619
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:37,720 
"You and I...
Iocked up in a room"

620
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,320 
"And the key gets lost"

621
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:20,280 
"Far away from the madding crowd,
behind the mountains"

622
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:24,400 
"Lost in each other
under thick trees..."

623
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:28,560 
"A place unseen and
unknown to anyone"

624
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:32,480 
"Just you and I, and
the breeze for company"

625
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:35,640 
"Think what it'll be like
if this happens"

626
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,800 
"You and I..."

627
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:49,320 
"are passing through a forest"

628
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:55,000 
"and encounter a tiger"

629
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:10,680 
"I'll ask it to spare you..."

630
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:14,800 
"and devour me instead"

631
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:19,480 
"You and I...
Iocked up in a room"

632
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:23,160 
"And the key gets lost"

633
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:09,560 
"Why are you so lost?"

634
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:13,480 
"Why pretend to be asleep,
when awake?"

635
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:17,480 
"Who knows what will
happen tomorrow"

636
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:21,480 
"That's worrying me a bit"

637
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:25,600 
"Think, what if something happens"

638
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,520 
"You and I..."

639
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,800 
"we're frolicking around"

640
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:45,160 
"and suddenly our eyes
are filled with tears"

641
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:58,600 
"I swear on your head..."

642
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:03,080 
"I'll just drop dead"

643
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:09,040 
"You and I...
Iocked up in a room"

644
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,480 
"And the key gets lost"

645
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:20,600 
"Then I too will lose myself
in the charm of your eyes"

646
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:24,280 
"You and I..."

647
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:28,920 
"both locked up in a room"

648
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:33,720 
"And the key gets lost"

649
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:40,400 
"And the key...
- gets lost"

650
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:06,760 
- Has Raja returned?
- I was going to ask you that.

651
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:11,600 
Had he told me before going,
to inform me of his arrival?

652
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:15,840 
You talk as though I asked him
to go with that girl!

653
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:21,720 
Of course not. You're not at fault.
You were busy with your social life.

654
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,840 
How will you know
what your son is up to?

655
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,760 
Ask yourself that!

656
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:29,960 
He's been here for quite some
time. Have you ever sat with him?

657
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:37,280 
Why him? Have you had the time to
sit with your wife for 20 minutes?

658
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:42,360 
What do you mean? Do I neglect
my business and follow you around?

659
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:45,760 
No. Neglect your family
and make money.

660
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:50,920 
Whom do I earn it for?
You and Raja...

661
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:52,920 
Don't take his name! Have you ever
given him love?

662
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:56,200 
As if you have!

663
01:33:56,400 --> 01:34:03,200 
Thanks to you! You sent him away.
When he came back he was grown up!

664
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:07,480 
Yes! He didn't miss anything
by not being hugged by you!

665
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:18,680 
Neither he missed it,
nor did you lose anything.

666
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:22,280 
Only I felt childless.

667
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:43,600 
Brought flowers from Kashmir, eh?

668
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:49,840 
Yes, the season was loverly.
Spring! Full of flowers.

669
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:55,880 
- But we're ablaze here!
- It's hot, but I see no fire...

670
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:59,240 
You don't, but
I'm feeling the heat.

671
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:01,440 
I don't understand.

672
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:05,520 
I'm ashamed to say it.
One doesn't know when my son...

673
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:09,400 
and that slut-of a-daughter
of a servant...

674
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:29,440 
But Bobby's not a slut.
No doubt. Aunty was my governess...

675
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:34,640 
But everybody has a lean period.
Today they're well settled in life.

676
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:41,600 
Who all will I tell this to?
Everyone knows she was our servant.

677
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:48,080 
Was! Today they have servants.
Mr. Braganza has some status today.

678
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:53,920 
What does he do for a living?

679
01:35:57,480 --> 01:36:03,040 
And Dad, Bobby is a good and
a decent girl. If you meet her...

680
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:05,320 
Can you call them over?

681
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:14,040 
Invite them for dinner tomorrow.
I don't want to delay this issue.

682
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:22,160 
Will you have dinner with us?
My father wants to meet you.

683
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:23,400 
Why?

684
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:25,520 
- To see Bobby.
- What for?

685
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:36,280 
I'll come. For my daughter's sake,
I can bow at anyone's door...

686
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:40,280 
- But I won't kneel! Know why?
- Why?

687
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:45,240 
"I don't want any gold or silver;
I seek not diamonds and pearls"

688
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,600 
"Of what use are
they for me?"

689
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:56,280 
"I won't ask for a bungalow, nor
a carriage driven by horses"

690
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:59,400 
"They're all just
for name sake"

691
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:06,440 
"Instead, give me your heart
in exchange for mine"

692
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:17,200 
"So take it...
it's all yours, sir"

693
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:20,680 
"There's no bargaining
in love"

694
01:38:55,200 --> 01:39:00,000 
"I don't know about maulvi or kazi,
or even Mecca or Varanasi..."

695
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:03,160 
"I'm just thirsting for love"

696
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:10,440 
"Dear Queen of my dreams...
you'll be thunder-struck to know"

697
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:13,760 
"that I'm just mad about you"

698
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:20,880 
"So will you swap hearts
with me?"

699
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:26,080 
"Go on, give me your heart
in hange for mine"

700
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:31,760 
"Take it, sir...
It's all yours"

701
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:34,880 
"No bargaining with love"

702
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:13,560 
"If you lie, a crow will peck you.
So beware!"

703
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:19,400 
"I'll go to my mother's
while you stand and watch"

704
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:33,960 
"You're lying!
So a black crow will peck you"

705
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:37,120 
"Beware now...
I'll go to my mother's..."

706
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:41,760 
"right under your nose!
I'll go to my mother's..."

707
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,360 
"while you just stand and gape"

708
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:15,720 
"If you go to your mother's,
I'll pick up a stick"

709
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:18,880 
"I'll come with a stick"

710
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:24,080 
"If you come with a stick,
I'll jump in the well"

711
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:29,280 
"I'll pull you up with a rope"

712
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:31,920 
"Then I'll climb up a tree"

713
01:41:31,160 --> 01:41:34,560 
"I'll cut it down
with a saw"

714
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:43,320 
"Will he love me, or use a saw?
Better beware of such a lover..."

715
01:41:44,440 --> 01:41:49,160 
"I'll go to my mother's!
Just you watch!"

716
01:41:54,680 --> 01:42:00,600 
"You lie and be pecked by a crow.
But beware!"

717
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:05,240 
"I'll go to my mother's...
right under your nose"

718
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:10,760 
"I'll go to my mom,
just you wait!"

719
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,520 
"If you go to your Mom's..."

720
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:39,640 
"I'll get married again
to some other woman"

721
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:45,520 
"You'll marry another girl?
Get a rival for me?"

722
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:53,280 
"Then I won't go to my mother's..."

723
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:04,360 
"I'll stick to you...
I won't go to my mother's"

724
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:09,520 
"I'll keep all my promises,
but I won't leave you..."

725
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:15,160 
"Honestly, I won't go
to my mother's now"

726
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:21,480 
"Remember, you lie and the
black crow will peck you"

727
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:27,760 
"Beware!
I'll get you a rival"

728
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:35,040 
"And you can't do anything!
I'll marry again, just you wait"

729
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:41,280 
"Liar! And may the crow peck you.
So beware!"

730
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:46,520 
"I won't go to my mother's..."

731
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:17,040 
Welcome, sir.
Come in, Aunty.

732
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:39,320 
How about some whisky?

733
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:44,000 
I don't drink whisky.
I prefer Rum.

734
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:48,480 
And I've a permit for it too;
shall I show you?

735
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:52,200 
Serve him Rum. Come, sir.

736
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,400 
Have a seat.

737
01:44:56,640 --> 01:44:59,360 
So how's your fishing business?

738
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:03,360 
First class.
There's lot of money in fish, sir.

739
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:06,480 
And there's lot of fish
in the sea too, Ma'am.

740
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:16,880 
- Where do you export your fish?
- What export?

741
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:20,080 
What she means is which
countries does your fish go to?

742
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:25,080 
What are you saying, sir?
I sweat all day and atch fish.

743
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:28,720 
I can't supply this city,
how can I export it?

744
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:33,480 
Shall I tell you something?
If we sell a fish for Re. 1...

745
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:38,000 
when it comes on your table, it
costs Rs.8. Middlemen make profit.

746
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:44,840 
But don't worry, I'll give you a
basket full, of fresh fish, daily.

747
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:54,480 
Raja, won't you show
your room to Bobby?

748
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:10,760 
They make such a lovely pair.
How happy the kids look!

749
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:15,200 
Yes, they're kids.
...Your rum.

750
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:18,280 
Water, or Soda?

751
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:27,360 
I'm a fisherman; I take it neat.
Dilution weakens it. Fill it up.

752
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:31,040 
Till I take my full quota,
I can't think properly.

753
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:47,720 
My father can't talk with style.
I hope your father understands.

754
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:54,200 
I understand only too well,
what you're after.

755
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:58,360 
I'm a God-fearing man, sir.
I really tell you.

756
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:03,200 
I only want my daughter's happiness.
God has given me everything.

757
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:08,840 
- She's my only daughter.
- Raja's my only son too.

758
01:47:10,040 --> 01:47:13,480 
There's nothing more valuable
than his happiness, for me too.

759
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:20,120 
He's naive. Doesn't realise that
what seems joy is in fact danger!

760
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:33,480 
Actually you dreamt a lofty dream.

761
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:38,040 
I'm sorry, that it won't
come true however.

762
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:45,160 
You see where you live,
and the way you live.

763
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:49,560 
Just think where you are,
and where we stand.

764
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:01,840 
How did you think that your
daughter will come here as...

765
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:09,600 
What did you say?

766
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:14,400 
- I planned all this? Me?
- Isn't it possible...

767
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:19,800 
that your mother could've thought
of this when she worked here?

768
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:24,840 
That one day Raja will grow
up and so will your daughter.

769
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:33,080 
Yes! He's my heir to all
my wealth. But still a kid.

770
01:48:34,280 --> 01:48:37,400 
A stupid bird sees the grain,
but not the trap!

771
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:40,480 
And with the kind of
beautiful trap you've laid...

772
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:33,320 
Hold on.

773
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:42,080 
Cherish this.
I'll think that my love is safe.

774
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:01,600 
We'll not stay here a minute
longer. Come, mother.

775
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:06,720 
- I'll never forget this meeting.
- I'll leave them to the taxi-stand.

776
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:12,320 
Your Daddy's rum is not strong...

777
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:16,160 
enough to make me lose my way.

778
01:50:19,480 --> 01:50:23,680 
I had told you, for the sake
of Bobby's happiness...

779
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:28,520 
I'll bow at anybody's door,
but I'll not kneel!

780
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:17,120 
How come a richie-rich bothered
to come to my humble hut?

781
01:51:29,120 --> 01:51:34,640 
Last night you got angry and
returned home. Later I realised...

782
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:39,800 
my way of saying things was wrong.
- Let alone ways, sir.

783
01:51:40,120 --> 01:51:41,920 
What you said was wrong.

784
01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:48,240 
I owe you yesterday's rum.

785
01:51:51,720 --> 01:51:55,160 
I don't drink in the mornings.

786
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:01,800 
And I drink 24 hours, sir.
You big-wigs keep a schedule.

787
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:07,200 
If you have anything worthwhile
to say, carry on.

788
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:10,880 
Indeed! It is worthwile for you.

789
01:52:12,520 --> 01:52:16,600 
I've come to ask you,
how much money do you want?

790
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:23,600 
How much money do I want?
What did you say?

791
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:28,480 
- I didn't hear you properly.
- You heard me alright.

792
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:34,360 
You are an excellent angler!
You net good fish!

793
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:38,120 
And this time,
my son has been caught in it.

794
01:52:39,640 --> 01:52:41,680 
I don't wish you
to undergo any loss!

795
01:52:43,400 --> 01:52:46,920 
Tell me, what's your
price to set my son free?

796
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,040 
Rs.20,000, Rs.50,000.

797
01:52:54,240 --> 01:52:58,200 
You brought a cheque-book?!
You wait.

798
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:02,800 
Hold on, man.
I'll show you.

799
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:13,760 
Comes with a cheque-book!
Dangles money at me!

800
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:25,080 
You think only you have money?
Even I have it. Look!

801
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:30,760 
You rich have just money,
cars, bungalows...

802
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:34,240 
You've just wealth,
but not hearts.

803
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:38,960 
And we poor, have honour,
hearts, and happiness.

804
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:42,680 
And we don't sell these
things, understand?

805
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:46,560 
You don't sell, but make
business out of it!

806
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:52,480 
People with honour don't turn
their daughters into bales of hay...

807
01:53:52,720 --> 01:53:56,440 
and offer them to sons
of millionaires. Get me?

808
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:29,560 
Had Mr. Nath come?
Go inside, dear.

809
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:35,600 
Why are you just standing?
Tell me. Why was he here?

810
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:39,920 
Why?
To tell me that...

811
01:54:40,040 --> 01:54:46,520 
you're a whore.
And that I'm a bastard...

812
01:54:46,760 --> 01:54:49,320 
That I force my daughter
to sell herself.

813
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:58,480 
Do you know why that friend is
trampling our prestige like this?

814
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:02,320 
Because you fed his son!

815
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:20,200 
Raju had given me this.

816
01:55:20,440 --> 01:55:25,240 
I'll drown you if
you take his name!

817
01:55:25,800 --> 01:55:30,600 
I'll pack off both of you.
Go to Goa at once.

818
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:32,720 
- Why?
- If you speak...

819
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:34,280 
I'll have your tongue!

820
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:40,240 
I don't want that boy to
come here and meet my baby.

821
01:55:40,440 --> 01:55:41,880 
Off you go!

822
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:05,880 
- How dare you come here!
- I've come for Bobby.

823
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:12,600 
I don't want to hear her name
on your lips, do you hear?

824
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:17,040 
She's dead to you!

825
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:35,720 
I beg of you...
Before I do something to you...

826
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:40,080 
Please go from here.

827
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:48,080 
You've made life one big hell
for my daughter.

828
01:56:52,440 --> 01:56:58,560 
She'll never laugh again. You've made
a living corpse out of her.

829
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:08,960 
"My heart broke..."

830
01:57:12,120 --> 01:57:15,240 
"into a thousand pieces..."

831
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:21,960 
"in my heart"

832
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:34,440 
"Let me hug you and die"

833
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:44,880 
"What's the point in living"

834
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:50,720 
"Let our eyes see
each other, at least"

835
01:57:56,160 --> 01:58:03,680 
"Let our eyes be
in each other's view"

836
01:58:04,600 --> 01:58:06,800 
"So that even from afar..."

837
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:12,080 
"we can quench our
thirst for each other"

838
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:20,400 
"Let us be close enough
to see each other"

839
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:28,760 
"So that even from a distance
our thirst can be quenched"

840
01:58:29,720 --> 01:58:32,920 
"So let our eyes at least
see each other"

841
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,720 
Where had you been?

842
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:08,520 
I asked "where had you been?"

843
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:14,280 
- You know where I had been.
- Why?

844
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:23,080 
- Answer me! Why?
- You know why.

845
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:27,360 
- That's no answer.
- Okay. I had gone to meet Bobby.

846
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:34,600 
I can't live without her.
I... I love her.

847
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:38,720 
Love, my foot!
You're not old enough for love.

848
01:59:39,560 --> 01:59:42,600 
Do you know what love is,
and who is worthy of it?

849
01:59:43,680 --> 01:59:49,760 
First you brought scum here and
now I'll just stand and watch?

850
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:54,480 
Hear me good, son. The prestige
of this house is no toy.

851
01:59:55,160 --> 01:59:59,640 
This is my house. One who doesn't
obey me has no right to stay here.

852
02:00:01,480 --> 02:00:03,360 
Where are you going?

853
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:05,560 
Sir, I had wrongly thought
this was my home too.

854
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:12,360 
What childishness is this?
Where will you go?

855
02:00:14,360 --> 02:00:17,920 
Can't I be a shoe-shine boy,
or work as a labourer?

856
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:22,160 
Let him go, dear.
He'll be back in two days.

857
02:00:23,320 --> 02:00:28,640 
He doesn't know about those boys
who become old men straight away.

858
02:00:29,480 --> 02:00:33,360 
- Who don't know what's youth!
- If that's my destiny, so be it.

859
02:00:34,040 --> 02:00:37,640 
Even if I've to starve. At least
I'll be with the one I love.

860
02:00:40,040 --> 02:00:42,280 
So you're seeing that mirage, eh?

861
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:48,520 
Even the law doesn't permit
you to do this.

862
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:54,560 
Because you're still a minor.
If you marry, you'll land in jail.

863
02:00:56,560 --> 02:01:00,760 
Your father's right, son.
Become 21 years old...

864
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:02,880 
and then do what you like.

865
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:24,160 
- He has begun to talk back!
- You also scold him like a kid.

866
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:29,720 
- Why don't you convince him?
- What do today's kids think we are?

867
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:32,520 
Do today's parents understand
their kids?

868
02:01:34,200 --> 02:01:35,200 
Meaning?

869
02:01:35,480 --> 02:01:40,120 
Just that modern kids want
to see, with open eyes.

870
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:44,600 
It's not necessary that their view
should match their parents view.

871
02:01:46,040 --> 02:01:49,960 
A 19 year old boy
isn't a kid, Mr. Nath.

872
02:01:50,920 --> 02:01:54,840 
It's just 2 years. I'll be 21,
and you'll be 19 years old.

873
02:01:55,680 --> 02:01:59,720 
Then no power on earth can stop us.
The law, or our parents.

874
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:04,440 
Never mind. I've found a way.
I'll get Raja married.

875
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:08,040 
- Without asking him?
- Will he agree if I ask him?

876
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:12,760 
Thanks to Ms. Pestonji we've got
a decent proposal from Mr. Sharma.

877
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:17,840 
Welcome, sir.
We were just talking about you.

878
02:02:19,080 --> 02:02:22,040 
Yes Bobby, we'll have a
sweet home after we marry.

879
02:02:22,760 --> 02:02:27,040 
I promise I'll give you
the house of your dreams.

880
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:33,960 
Since our children will wed soon,
this house is ine and vice versa.

881
02:02:35,280 --> 02:02:39,400 
Now that you both are related,
how about sealing it with a hug?

882
02:02:44,120 --> 02:02:47,600 
I'm having a New Year Party
and you're all invited.

883
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:51,600 
We'll have a drink together, and
the boy and the girl can meet too.

884
02:02:55,920 --> 02:03:01,440 
We'll never keep our kids away
from us. We'll love them a lot.

885
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:05,760 
Without love, kids become
very insecure, Bobby.

886
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:09,200 
There's a difference in dreams
and reality, Raj.

887
02:03:10,280 --> 02:03:11,800 
What?

888
02:03:16,560 --> 02:03:18,360 
Of what use is such innocence?

889
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:21,280 
That you can't even hear
your dream being shattered?

890
02:03:26,120 --> 02:03:28,160 
This is not the
House of Your Dreams.

891
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:32,320 
Run away, Raj...
Run away from them all!

892
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:41,160 
Anything special?

893
02:03:41,320 --> 02:03:44,640 
No, the usual.
Music, dance, drinks etc.

894
02:03:45,120 --> 02:03:48,880 
But for us it'll certainly be special.
We'll start the year on a new note.

895
02:03:54,320 --> 02:03:58,240 
Looks as though he has invited
the whole who's who! Come!

896
02:04:01,320 --> 02:04:03,240 
Look, they've come.

897
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:08,600 
- Our future son-in-law...
- How he has grown!

898
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:17,000 
- Yes?
- Introduce Raja to my daughter.

899
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:28,520 
Look after your special guest.
This is Raja.

900
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:36,240 
You took so long to come.
Made me wait so much...

901
02:04:45,240 --> 02:04:47,080 
I didn't recognise you.

902
02:04:50,680 --> 02:04:54,120 
No?
You didn't recognise me?

903
02:04:55,720 --> 02:04:57,760 
I'm Alka...

904
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:02,800 
So, you're Mr. Sharma's daughter.

905
02:05:03,480 --> 02:05:06,520 
Yes, I'm the one.

906
02:05:07,280 --> 02:05:09,440 
This house is mine. Nice, eh?

907
02:05:11,680 --> 02:05:18,000 
My daddy built this house
just for me. Only me.

908
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:25,600 
I'm his only child, so I'll be
inheriting all this one day.

909
02:05:26,160 --> 02:05:28,760 
That's why everybody
loves me so very much.

910
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:36,680 
Everybody calls me by my pet name,
Nicky. You also call me Nicky.

911
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:38,600 
I prefer Alka.

912
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:47,600 
I'll tell everybody now
to call me Alka, Okay?

913
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:52,280 
- Your doll's very nice.
- Yes, isn't she?

914
02:05:53,160 --> 02:05:57,280 
I've a room full of dolls.
Come, I'll show you.

915
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:02,200 
I know I've grown up
and become tall too.

916
02:06:03,120 --> 02:06:06,040 
But mentally, I'm still a kid.

917
02:06:07,680 --> 02:06:11,680 
So what? The doctor said
when I get married...

918
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:15,440 
everything will be fine.

919
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:24,560 
- You will marry me, won't you?
- Me? Marry you?

920
02:06:27,360 --> 02:06:28,960 
You will, won't you?

921
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:39,880 
You're not like the others.
You will marry me?

922
02:06:41,880 --> 02:06:47,720 
- Who told you this?
- My Dad. Your Dad.

923
02:06:48,440 --> 02:06:52,920 
My Dad said he'd give your Dad
a whole lot of business.

924
02:06:54,400 --> 02:06:58,520 
And they'll send us abroad
for our honeymoon.

925
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:05,840 
My dad's wealth is all mine and
then yours after marriage.

926
02:07:11,400 --> 02:07:16,560 
You will marry me?
My dream will come true?

927
02:07:17,680 --> 02:07:19,760 
I will become a bride, won't I?

928
02:07:22,960 --> 02:07:26,280 
I will be a bride...

929
02:07:41,080 --> 02:07:46,720 
What's this? You asked me to wait
till I was 21. Why am I cheated?

930
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:54,200 
I didn't do anything. This proposal
was good so your father decided.

931
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:03,360 
This is my life. Who are you
to take decisions about it?

932
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:13,720 
Your father! The decision is final.
It's for your own good and progress.

933
02:08:14,160 --> 02:08:16,880 
You've sold me for money,
by making this deal.

934
02:08:18,640 --> 02:08:22,400 
Learn to be polite, son.
No use arguing about it now.

935
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:25,520 
Mr. Sharma is going to make it
official tomorrow.

936
02:08:27,640 --> 02:08:30,160 
"Trapped"

937
02:08:33,360 --> 02:08:36,400 
"He who has left home,
has no roof over his head..."

938
02:08:36,640 --> 02:08:42,640 
"and made a home
in someone else's heart"

939
02:08:46,040 --> 02:08:48,120 
"He's now trapped!"

940
02:09:44,640 --> 02:09:50,520 
"This one year between
boyhood and manhood..."

941
02:09:50,640 --> 02:09:54,720 
"is very traumatic.
This one year..."

942
02:09:55,320 --> 02:10:01,560 
"of youth, of innocence,
and madness"

943
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:09,280 
"This one year between boyhood
and manhood is ad"

944
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:15,560 
"The good name of the lover
is tarred"

945
02:10:15,720 --> 02:10:19,760 
"And the world laughed"

946
02:10:22,480 --> 02:10:24,560 
"He's trapped"

947
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:28,080 
"One who has no home
or a roof over his head..."

948
02:10:28,760 --> 02:10:34,400 
"and instead made a home
in someone else's heart..."

949
02:10:37,800 --> 02:10:40,200 
"is totally trapped"

950
02:11:38,320 --> 02:11:42,240 
"Better that today itself
with a cage and all..."

951
02:11:42,360 --> 02:11:46,360 
"the bird flies away.
It might save his life"

952
02:11:49,160 --> 02:11:52,720 
"Through some opening...
by seeking a proper chance"

953
02:11:53,320 --> 02:11:56,840 
"Even by deceit...
better today..."

954
02:11:58,240 --> 02:12:02,640 
"that the bird flies off
with the cage and all..."

955
02:12:03,240 --> 02:12:06,240 
"Life has become unbearable"

956
02:12:07,200 --> 02:12:12,520 
"because somebody has bitten
through and through..."

957
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:18,360 
"See... he's trapped!"

958
02:12:18,680 --> 02:12:21,920 
"He who has left home
has no roof over his head..."

959
02:12:22,200 --> 02:12:28,160 
"and made a home in
someone's heart"

960
02:12:30,920 --> 02:12:32,960 
"Is trapped"

961
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:18,400 
You're responsible for this.
I told you to take his consent.

962
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:24,840 
I did say he can't be forced.
He ran away! My son has gone.

963
02:13:36,240 --> 02:13:41,920 
Look, if I find my son
with your daughter...

964
02:13:42,200 --> 02:13:46,480 
I won't spare you.
I'll finish you!

965
02:13:47,160 --> 02:13:50,880 
Don't threaten me, man.

966
02:13:51,320 --> 02:13:53,960 
If you have the guts, do it.

967
02:13:57,400 --> 02:14:03,560 
Go find your son. Must be playing
around with some innocent girl.

968
02:14:03,960 --> 02:14:06,760 
Else, must be lying in a gutter!

969
02:14:23,640 --> 02:14:25,720 
- Who do you want?
- Does Aunty live here?

970
02:14:25,920 --> 02:14:28,400 
Who?
She's inside

971
02:14:32,080 --> 02:14:33,480 
Master Raja?

972
02:14:38,440 --> 02:14:41,440 
I've left everything
behind, Aunty. Forever and ever.

973
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:46,600 
You've come without your
anyone's permission?

974
02:14:47,720 --> 02:14:52,880 
Whose permission would I have taken?
A mom who never had time for me.

975
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:56,640 
Who doesn't and never will.
That father, who never loved me?

976
02:14:57,400 --> 02:14:59,640 
I've left that home.

977
02:15:03,400 --> 02:15:07,520 
You've come.
I always knew you'd come.

978
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:11,480 
Stop right there, girl.
I won't let you meet him.

979
02:15:13,120 --> 02:15:17,040 
- But why?
- Because you ran away from home.

980
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:19,320 
You've done wrong.

981
02:15:19,560 --> 02:15:22,960 
What's right and what isn't, Aunty?
Was my father right?

982
02:15:23,320 --> 02:15:25,280 
He was selling me. Selling!

983
02:15:27,400 --> 02:15:30,480 
He was getting me married to a
mentally handicapped girl for money.

984
02:15:31,560 --> 02:15:33,640 
Is he's right?

985
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:37,120 
Must've thought of a good future.

986
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:43,240 
I've also thought about my life.
Who's he to finalise my marriage?

987
02:15:44,360 --> 02:15:47,880 
- The law has given him the right.
- What law?

988
02:15:48,120 --> 02:15:51,400 
It's my life and someone
else decides about it?

989
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:54,200 
Don't stop us, Gran.

990
02:15:54,560 --> 02:15:57,800 
He has left his home far behind.
Hasn't he come for me?

991
02:15:58,720 --> 02:16:03,440 
- I order you. Go upstairs!
- No, Gran, no!

992
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:05,480 
I've listened to you before,
but I'll not obey you now.

993
02:16:11,120 --> 02:16:14,680 
- Take her up and lock her!
- What are you doing, Gran?

994
02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:22,520 
The right thing. When the time
will prove that ou were wrong...

995
02:16:22,720 --> 02:16:26,880 
you both will say,
"Why didn't you stop us...

996
02:16:27,480 --> 02:16:32,960 
- when there was still time?
- No! Who are you to stop me?

997
02:16:42,720 --> 02:16:48,440 
What do you want?
Haven't we suffered enough?

998
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:52,480 
Do you know how your father
has insulted my son?

999
02:16:52,960 --> 02:16:56,120 
If he comes to know you're
here, he'll...

1000
02:17:04,520 --> 02:17:08,120 
- Take her up and lock her.
- I'll die, Gran.

1001
02:17:08,680 --> 02:17:10,760 
I can't stay without him.

1002
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:20,240 
Please Gran...
I'll die without him.

1003
02:17:28,760 --> 02:17:33,000 
Release Bobby.
Don't be so cruel to her.

1004
02:17:35,160 --> 02:17:39,920 
You know how much we love each other.
We're not committing any sin.

1005
02:17:41,080 --> 02:17:46,240 
- We want to get married.
- You can't! You're under age.

1006
02:17:46,800 --> 02:17:51,440 
Do you know what can happen.
Jack can be jailed.

1007
02:17:51,640 --> 02:17:54,920 
I can be jailed and,
Bobby will become homeless.

1008
02:17:55,680 --> 02:17:59,840 
- Her life can be ruined.
- No, no...

1009
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:01,880 
Not when I'm alive.

1010
02:18:08,200 --> 02:18:10,240 
I've come with great hopes.

1011
02:18:12,040 --> 02:18:17,200 
I've looked to you as a mother.
And thought you'd give me shelter.

1012
02:18:19,680 --> 02:18:21,680 
Only you love me, Aunty.

1013
02:18:23,440 --> 02:18:28,040 
Because I love you, I'm stopping
you from committing a mistake.

1014
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:36,880 
- Till I come back, sit over there.
- Where are you going?

1015
02:18:38,480 --> 02:18:41,920 
To wire your father
to take you home!

1016
02:18:42,400 --> 02:18:43,400 
No!

1017
02:18:45,400 --> 02:18:48,640 
That's betrayal! Don't do this.
Why are you doing this?

1018
02:18:48,920 --> 02:18:56,160 
Wait! Don't do this.
Don't go, Wait!

1019
02:18:56,480 --> 02:19:02,000 
Listen to me. Don't go.
don't do this. Wait!

1020
02:19:02,480 --> 02:19:08,360 
Don't lie! You sent Raja to Goa
and now show an empty house.

1021
02:19:09,360 --> 02:19:13,240 
You! You're back again?

1022
02:19:14,840 --> 02:19:18,800 
Got the police with you
to scare me, eh?

1023
02:19:19,320 --> 02:19:23,120 
I told you to go and seek
your son in some gutter!

1024
02:19:24,080 --> 02:19:27,120 
No need to do that.

1025
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:31,400 
He's lying in a dirty gutter
at your place in Goa.

1026
02:19:35,880 --> 02:19:40,000 
Your mother has sent this wire.
Raja is at your home.

1027
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:45,920 
You told me your daughter's in Goa.
You didn't tell me...

1028
02:19:46,080 --> 02:19:49,040 
...you've sent Raja
with her to flirt around.

1029
02:19:49,360 --> 02:19:51,440 
Mind your tongue.

1030
02:19:52,320 --> 02:19:56,960 
This is a clever move from you.
It costs just Rs.2/-.

1031
02:19:57,440 --> 02:19:59,080 
It can be sent from anywhere.

1032
02:20:01,160 --> 02:20:08,360 
Hadn't I told you that if I find
my son with your daughter...

1033
02:20:08,560 --> 02:20:14,480 
then I'll chop her to pieces!
I'll chop her up and throw her!

1034
02:20:14,880 --> 02:20:18,640 
Else, I'll send you to the jail.
Inspector, you wait here.

1035
02:20:18,840 --> 02:20:20,720 
You come with me to Goa now.

1036
02:20:22,040 --> 02:20:27,000 
You insult us poor, Mr. Nath.
I swear by Jesus.

1037
02:20:28,600 --> 02:20:31,760 
If I find your son
with my daughter...

1038
02:20:31,880 --> 02:20:35,400 
then I'll mince her.
Else, I'll send you to jail.

1039
02:20:36,480 --> 02:20:39,080 
Come to Goa with me.
Inspector, I'll be right back.

1040
02:23:26,920 --> 02:23:29,920 
- Yes, Gran?
- It's very late.

1041
02:23:30,840 --> 02:23:33,160 
- Go to sleep now.
- Okay, Gran.

1042
02:23:54,920 --> 02:23:57,880 
Why did you risk your life?
What if you had slipped?

1043
02:23:58,520 --> 02:24:03,160 
Better I die than live without you.
If you can't stay without me...

1044
02:24:04,240 --> 02:24:07,640 
- Neither can I.
- I know.

1045
02:24:09,200 --> 02:24:13,560 
But what can we do? Tomorrow
your Dad will take you away.

1046
02:24:14,680 --> 02:24:18,160 
- And, we'll be separated...
- Never!

1047
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:21,200 
No way!

1048
02:24:21,960 --> 02:24:24,000 
But we can't afford
to give in either.

1049
02:24:26,640 --> 02:24:29,600 
Look at me.
And answer me.

1050
02:24:31,360 --> 02:24:33,600 
Will you be with me always?

1051
02:24:36,240 --> 02:24:39,200 
In joy and sorrow,
good times and bad?

1052
02:24:40,400 --> 02:24:44,040 
In death?
Will you be there with me?

1053
02:24:46,480 --> 02:24:48,840 
- Always?
- Always Raju. Forever.

1054
02:25:10,200 --> 02:25:13,800 
This is my house.
Search for that boy.

1055
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:18,640 
- You and here, son?
- Thanks to this richie-rich!

1056
02:25:19,720 --> 02:25:23,280 
Ask Mr. Nath. He's accusing us
of a new crime now.

1057
02:25:23,560 --> 02:25:28,760 
Says I've hidden his son here.
Look at this false telegram.

1058
02:25:28,960 --> 02:25:32,400 
Says you sent it!
Tell him it's a hoax.

1059
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,080 
I sent the telegram, son.

1060
02:25:39,320 --> 02:25:42,800 
Come, sir. Thank God you came.
Raja is in this room.

1061
02:25:43,360 --> 02:25:46,520 
I didn't let those two meet.
I sat out here the whole night.

1062
02:25:48,160 --> 02:25:53,480 
Raja's still a kid.
And kids do err. Forgive him.

1063
02:26:06,640 --> 02:26:08,440 
Sorry, but nobody here.

1064
02:26:13,800 --> 02:26:18,480 
Stop playing Blind man's Buff,
and tell us where Raja is!

1065
02:26:18,920 --> 02:26:22,400 
Isn't he inside? He was there.
I've been out here all night.

1066
02:26:23,080 --> 02:26:28,960 
Don't ham, Madam. I didn't
bring the police for nothing.

1067
02:26:29,320 --> 02:26:30,480 
I can get you arrested
right this minute.

1068
02:26:33,520 --> 02:26:38,000 
They've changed their spots now.
Can't demand money in your presence.

1069
02:26:40,800 --> 02:26:43,360 
I've locked Bobby upstairs.

1070
02:26:43,960 --> 02:26:46,000 
- Master Raja, could be...
- Give me the key.

1071
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:21,360 
Nath! Come and see this!

1072
02:27:21,640 --> 02:27:25,440 
Go and see Inspector.
Now let me tell you something.

1073
02:27:25,840 --> 02:27:30,600 
Your son has kidnapped
my 16-year old minor daughter.

1074
02:27:31,720 --> 02:27:37,200 
Inspector, arrest him at once...
and ask where my daughter is!

1075
02:27:37,520 --> 02:27:40,080 
- Don't blabber!
- I'm not blabbering.

1076
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:46,080 
Just warning you that Bobby
didn't go to your house.

1077
02:27:46,600 --> 02:27:52,840 
Your son came here!
Let me tell you another thing.

1078
02:27:53,320 --> 02:27:57,000 
If anything happens to my girl
your son...

1079
02:27:57,080 --> 02:27:59,880 
will be personally chopped up
and fed to the dogs!

1080
02:28:05,400 --> 02:28:06,880 
No, Jack! No!

1081
02:29:30,360 --> 02:29:32,040 
Stop! Stop!

1082
02:29:34,240 --> 02:29:39,040 
Get that paper with the message
that a boy has kidnapped a girl...

1083
02:29:39,240 --> 02:29:43,920 
and check the motor-cycle number.
Are you Mr. Raj Nath?

1084
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:50,520 
No, it's Vishnu Rastogi.

1085
02:29:51,160 --> 02:29:56,120 
- And are you Bobby Braganza?
- No. Her name is...

1086
02:29:57,600 --> 02:30:01,120 
- Mrs. Vimla Rastogi.
- Correct.

1087
02:30:02,600 --> 02:30:05,200 
- Where's the paper?
- Under that drawer.

1088
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:05,600 
Did you see a yellow
motor-cycle carrying my Bobby...

1089
02:32:06,960 --> 02:32:09,840 
I mean a girl and a boy go this way?

1090
02:32:10,440 --> 02:32:12,760 
- Yes, how did you know?
- Got the news from the Police H.Q.

1091
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:07,400 
Brave girl!
Don't worry. All will be well.

1092
02:33:10,200 --> 02:33:13,520 
Thirsty? Hungry?
Come on.

1093
02:33:16,320 --> 02:33:23,280 
This is done by your son to stop us
from chasing him further.

1094
02:33:27,800 --> 02:33:30,560 
Look over there.
Your photograph.

1095
02:33:41,120 --> 02:33:44,680 
Why your photograph in the papers?

1096
02:33:45,760 --> 02:33:47,840 
Boss, saw this photograph?

1097
02:33:49,920 --> 02:33:54,080 
Dad has given an ad. that whoever
finds us will get Rs.25,000!

1098
02:33:54,960 --> 02:33:58,720 
- 25,000/-.
- Let's go, Bobby.

1099
02:34:03,400 --> 02:34:06,880 
I'm Prem.
Prem Chopra!

1100
02:34:08,200 --> 02:34:11,960 
Very glad to have met you.
Your paper, Sir. Come Bobby.

1101
02:34:16,280 --> 02:34:20,320 
- Will you drop us at the next stop?
- Okay, get in.

1102
02:34:22,880 --> 02:34:25,840 
Aren't you getting late?
Roll the truck. Come on!

1103
02:34:32,600 --> 02:34:35,440 
This is your snap, isn't it?
See? It's him.

1104
02:34:36,080 --> 02:34:38,960 
- The girl's not bad either.
- The boy's worth Rs.25,000/-!

1105
02:34:47,360 --> 02:34:50,800 
You're bullying these two?
Lock horns with me.

1106
02:35:00,360 --> 02:35:04,720 
Where do you want to go?
I'll take you in my vehicle.

1107
02:35:05,120 --> 02:35:07,960 
- Much obliged.
- It's my duty.

1108
02:35:08,240 --> 02:35:10,040 
No obligations. Come.

1109
02:35:15,720 --> 02:35:22,600 
It's not a sedan, but a small tempo.
But you can try it out. Come.

1110
02:35:23,960 --> 02:35:25,720 
See this photograph.

1111
02:35:36,400 --> 02:35:38,480 
They've come again...

1112
02:35:41,640 --> 02:35:45,080 
Don't worry.
We'll reach you safely.

1113
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:38,520 
Prem... Prem Chopra is my name.

1114
02:37:40,800 --> 02:37:42,360 
Let me go!

1115
02:37:47,560 --> 02:37:50,000 
Let me go!

1116
02:37:53,440 --> 02:37:57,480 
No...! Stop it!
How has he harmed you?

1117
02:37:58,880 --> 02:38:01,320 
- Leave him alone!
- Shall I?

1118
02:38:02,920 --> 02:38:08,800 
If I leave him, he'll run.
and with him that reward too!

1119
02:38:09,800 --> 02:38:12,960 
So why not break his legs?

1120
02:38:31,920 --> 02:38:36,480 
Break his leg, eh? Bastard!
I'll beat you to pulp!

1121
02:38:37,200 --> 02:38:42,040 
Fatso! You've come to share
the reward eh? Catch him.

1122
02:38:46,880 --> 02:38:51,560 
Talk of money! You rascal.
Don't you know they're my kids?

1123
02:39:20,680 --> 02:39:24,640 
Whoever you are, fatso,
you seem to be their friend.

1124
02:39:25,080 --> 02:39:28,560 
But remember,
if you act too smart...

1125
02:39:28,800 --> 02:39:32,320 
this knife will go through him!
- No!

1126
02:39:34,920 --> 02:39:39,960 
You can skin me alive.
But don't harm him. Let him go.

1127
02:39:40,280 --> 02:39:43,480 
Catch him, and skin him alive.

1128
02:39:58,520 --> 02:40:02,280 
Help! Help!

1129
02:40:06,840 --> 02:40:09,720 
Beat me as much as you like.

1130
02:40:11,040 --> 02:40:14,800 
But don't do anything
to that boy.

1131
02:40:18,320 --> 02:40:19,720 
Don't harm him...

1132
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:28,920 
- Catch the hooligans!
- Stop! Don't come any further.

1133
02:40:40,240 --> 02:40:45,040 
Come Bobby, let's run.
Daddy's here to separate us.

1134
02:40:45,480 --> 02:40:49,640 
He won't let us live together.
But nobody can separate us now.

1135
02:40:50,080 --> 02:40:54,160 
Nobody!
Hadn't you said...

1136
02:40:54,760 --> 02:40:58,160 
You'll be with me in joy,
sorrow, life and even death?

1137
02:40:58,400 --> 02:41:00,920 
- Yes.
- Come with me.

1138
02:41:17,840 --> 02:41:21,280 
Raja! Bobby!
Stop!

1139
02:41:50,160 --> 02:41:52,640 
Raja, don't go further,
please, son.

1140
02:41:54,800 --> 02:41:59,520 
- Don't go further. There's danger.
- There's danger ahead and behind too.

1141
02:42:00,040 --> 02:42:03,640 
- Why be scared of it?
- If you take one more step...

1142
02:42:03,800 --> 02:42:05,400 
you'll die.

1143
02:42:05,600 --> 02:42:09,840 
- If we return, will you let us be?
- How childish?

1144
02:42:10,240 --> 02:42:12,920 
This is not childishness.
It's love.

1145
02:42:13,440 --> 02:42:18,040 
But unfortunately you didn't realise
your son has his life, his own sense.

1146
02:42:18,320 --> 02:42:21,480 
They know what's good and bad.
You think we are child.

1147
02:42:22,240 --> 02:42:23,560 
Come back, son.

1148
02:42:23,760 --> 02:42:26,080 
To their parents, kids always
remain kids, son.

1149
02:42:26,480 --> 02:42:30,560 
Who's denying it? But I'm not
a piece of your property.

1150
02:42:31,400 --> 02:42:35,360 
Your society and law think that
our lives belong to you.

1151
02:42:36,240 --> 02:42:40,680 
Okay, Our lives may be...
But not our death!

1152
02:42:40,960 --> 02:42:44,480 
No...
How do I convince you now?

1153
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:46,920 
Come back, Both of you.

1154
02:42:48,120 --> 02:42:50,160 
We weren't meant to live together.

1155
02:42:51,800 --> 02:42:53,720 
But we can die together,
can't we?

1156
02:45:37,040 --> 02:45:39,080 
Your son is alive.

1157
02:45:40,160 --> 02:45:45,440 
Thank God! My daughter's alive too.
My daughter!

1158
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,240 
- Papa!
- Yes, my dear.

1159
02:45:51,480 --> 02:45:56,160 
My dear, when we nearly
lost you both today...

1160
02:45:57,560 --> 02:46:03,360 
I realised how invaluable
kids are to their parents.
