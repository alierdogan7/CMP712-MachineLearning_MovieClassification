1
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,238
Some relationships
are made forever, they say

2
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,235
This one too was
of that kind, perhaps

3
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,560
We met here, in this college,
for the first time

4
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,715
He was...

5
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,988
A class Computer Engineering student

6
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,638
A hot favourite among the girls

7
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,800
During exams, he was
much sought-after

8
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,116
For, everyone wanted
to pass with flying colours

9
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,236
He was my senior in college

10
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,034
In short, the hero
of decent students. Sam

11
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,030
I...

12
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,236
Madhav Shastri?
- Yes, sir

13
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,792
Are you Madhav Shastri?

14
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,590
He is absent even today.
He is incorrigible

15
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,235
A Mechanical Engineering student
ought to have a fire inside him

16
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,315
Yes, what was he asking?

17
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,390
Why I don't attend class regularly?

18
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,430
Ask him if he goes home regularly

19
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,396
Rangeela Beer Bar, every night

20
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,470
Does he know what a spare gear is?

21
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,953
A Mechanical Engineering student
ought to have a fire inside him!

22
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,910
If I get a chance, I'll teach him and
his family fire and backfire as well

23
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,635
Of course you will,
Madhav Shastri

24
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,795
My objective is to enjoy life
as long as I'm in college

25
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,116
Once out of college,
you have to face the music anyway

26
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,912
I was a Mechanical
Engineering student

27
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,396
Hey! Are you a don?

28
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,950
I never said that.
All I'm saying is that...

29
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,910
our college is too congested. Two dons
can't survive in one college, right?

30
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,914
So my advice is... you seniors
be the bully outside the college

31
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,669
Let me open my little shop
inside the college

32
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,752
Acting smart, eh?
- Oh no...

33
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,633
Is that a threat?
- No, sir

34
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,798
You will hit us?
- Damn! How can I hit you guys?

35
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,037
Hit me.
- No, sir

36
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,436
You're a don here, right?
Hit me!

37
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,236
I was the college bully

38
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,033
Now limp all your life.
Wants to be a don!

39
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,955
With my help students passed
with flying colours...

40
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,430
on the condition that
I too must come up trumps

41
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,716
Why the hell do you
come to college?

42
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,920
No question papers for you.
Girls must study and pass. Move

43
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,032
I was a total celibate

44
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,633
Please adjust

45
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,236
I was a hero in college, too

46
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,239
Rats! How dare they talk like that
with the girls in our group?

47
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,914
What did you say about Priya?
- It's already in the newspapers, eh?

48
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:00,757
Trying saying it before me.
- Nothing, I only said...

49
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,634
that Priya is flat at the front
and from behind...

50
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,510
I don't know why from
the very first day itself...

51
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,235
a special relationship
was formed between me and Samra

52
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,038
I think the jail is the right place
for you, not the college

53
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,635
Why do you do all this?

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,594
And Sam, you? Why do you want
to become a gangster?

55
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,235
You are a brilliant
and an intelligent student

56
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,718
My family's not a refugee

57
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,071
Not at all!
The stubble...

58
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,715
the chain around your neck,
unbuttoned shirt...

59
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,991
traits of a decent family indeed!

60
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,068
At least don't misuse the money
that your father sends you

61
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,271
This is the last warning
for the two of you

62
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,308
If I happen to get a complaint again,
I'll suspend both of you

63
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,238
Have some shame

64
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,230
What?
What are you staring at?

65
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,035
Don't think I'm going to spare you
because of the principal's warning

66
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,035
I'm scared

67
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,029
Know what?
I'm a simple and decent guy

68
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,992
However, I don't know why, everytime
I see you and your flunkeys...

69
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,949
I get really pissed off,
and I turn into a beast

70
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,039
You needn't. You were born beast

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,959
Don't abuse in English.
Try using your mother tongue

72
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,718
I hated him, he hated me

73
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,872
Please sit down

74
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,759
My friends are getting pretty bored,
growing weaker day by day

75
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,634
What I was thinking is that, if you
could provide them some tonic...

76
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,228
it'd be fun

77
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,558
Don't get it?
I mean...

78
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,236
Just like what you do
with Sam's friends

79
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,871
If you do that with these poor souls,
their lives will be made

80
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,232
Look, they have what Sam has...

81
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,556
except money,
which I'll provide

82
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,116
And you didn't give a thought
to what I will have to offer?

83
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,748
The messiah of the poor,
the big brother...

84
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,953
the guardian of girls, is here.
- He is here!

85
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,959
He is here!

86
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,397
You've got the wholesale agency
of the girls

87
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,638
If you could offer us some share...

88
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,876
The sister says no,
and the brother stops

89
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,236
This is what you call
the relationship of love

90
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,512
The relationship of love!
- Enough, stop

91
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,598
Don't flatter him so much

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,638
Let the casanova go with the girls

93
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,719
All he needs is a flute to play
the tunes, so let's buy him one

94
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,472
He tonsured us

95
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,079
Notjust the head...
- The chest too

96
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,479
He's incorrigible

97
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,870
Don't be afraid.
Give me the polythene bag

98
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,316
Turn away.
- Hurry up

99
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,795
It stinks.
- Shut up

100
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,395
The crackers, please

101
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,758
Notjust in the girls' hostel,
the sound of the crackers...

102
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,031
will also echo in Sam's life

103
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,632
Crackers? Urine?

104
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,480
Who was the other boy
with you, Manish?

105
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,639
If you give me his name,
I might spare you

106
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,036
Who was he?
- Samra, sir

107
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,113
Sir, I can't do such a thing.
You know me

108
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,476
I didn't expect this from you, either

109
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,639
I have done the enquiry.
Manish too has revealed your name

110
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,509
I will have to suspend you
for two months

111
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,235
Speak!

112
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,436
On whose bidding
did you frame me?

113
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,235
I...

114
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,195
Speak up!

115
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,358
He did it on my say-so.
Why hit a kid?

116
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,633
You're screwed

117
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,231
Suspended for two months

118
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,875
You cannot attend class
until my friends grow their hair back

119
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,156
How's the timing? Perfect, isn't it?

120
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,633
Enough of idiocy

121
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,036
You want to test
your strength, don't you?

122
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,912
I've been waiting for this!

123
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,510
Just tell me the place,
I'll be there, swear

124
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,633
Same rules?

125
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,430
Not on the face, punk!
Have you forgotten the rules?

126
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,916
See? I'm one up on you

127
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,679
Let me go!

128
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,877
Let go!
- You're saved!

129
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,232
But it's not over yet

130
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,749
The score's not settled yet.
- We're just off the mark

131
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,758
I'll bowl you out!
- Shut up!

132
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,752
Okay seniors,
let's have a group snap

133
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,798
Farewell party of the seniors

134
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,872
Let's mess things up

135
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,075
Yes?

136
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,475
Know what? I've been waiting
for this day

137
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,390
Tonight you are celebrating,
tomorrow, I will

138
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,430
How about finishing off what we
left unfinished the other day?

139
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,838
Tonight I'm sparing you

140
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,880
You're going to America, I hear

141
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,235
What's the job?
Ajanitor's?

142
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,472
You will certainly make it big.
For, you sweep well

143
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,919
Look, I will be doing that
in America

144
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,236
In two years, you will be doing
that right here

145
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,237
At least I'll be earning in dollars

146
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,950
Hey Sam, I have a small wish

147
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,716
Now that we've met here...

148
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,832
don't ever cross my path again

149
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,991
I have a wish too;...

150
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,430
to meet you again,
just once

151
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,952
To finish off what we left undone.
It'll be my turn

152
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,393
I thought it would be
our last meeting, but alas...

153
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,472
I'm Madhav Shastri,
and I'm your instructor

154
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,396
I'm a Mechanical Engineer, and...

155
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,998
I know well
how I completed my engineering

156
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,511
Notwithstanding, today
I'm teaching you software

157
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,514
One minute, Madhav

158
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,998
I don't want to go, sir

159
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,236
My lifeline is my dad, sir

160
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,237
He lives in Mumbai,
and I don't want to leave Mumbai

161
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,429
Sing a song

162
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,275
Wonderful

163
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,238
What the hell?
- Are you singing? Or are you begging?

164
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,991
That wasn't a song
to compliment the mood

165
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,955
What do you know about music?
- Maybe nothing...

166
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,272
but I know much about you.
- What do you know?

167
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,755
Oh really?

168
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,918
How far have you studied?
- A, B, C, D... MSC

169
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,913
Look at him. He passed matriculation
on his fourth attempt

170
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,556
And he forged the certificate,
turned SSC into MSC...

171
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,717
and tries to impress everyone

172
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,914
Notwithstanding, he taught Maths,
free of cost...

173
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,236
to the girl next door

174
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,798
That fatso?

175
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,229
Look at yourself. You are
a case in itself. Most Wanted

176
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,633
Every police station in the city
carries his photographs

177
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,036
Look at your shoes.
One size doesn't match the other

178
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,715
He has never been to a shoe-mart...

179
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,470
yet he gets a new pair of shoes
every week

180
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,751
How come?
- Every Tuesday...

181
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,712
he steals from the temples

182
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,755
And you? What did you do in front of
the Mahalaxmi temple for two years?

183
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,031
You tell us.
- This shameless character...

184
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,238
would throw a 25 paise coin
in some blind beggar's bowl...

185
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,238
and pick up 2 bucks from it.
- Bastard

186
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,353
Moron!
Stop that clapping and laughing

187
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,071
What have I done?
- Sadly, you haven't done anything yet

188
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,749
You are all of 25 now.
Swear by Samanta Fox's eyes...

189
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,237
and tell us about something worthwhile
that have you done

190
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,431
Why should I?
I have my father

191
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,951
You think we are test-tube babies?
Damn you

192
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:55,717
Fink! You haven't seen enough
of Mumbai and you brag about America

193
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,632
You guys suck. If there's a decent
and handsome guy in our group...

194
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,955
it's me.
- Agreed

195
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,956
If there's someone who spends half of
his salary on your fags and beer...

196
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,953
That's a lie.
- All right, agreed

197
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,078
Agreed, okay? So can't you sing
a lovely song for me?

198
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,755
Now you are trying
to use our talent

199
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,554
Sing, will you?
- Hear, will you?

200
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,759
Mughal-e-Azam! The world's
most beautiful love-story

201
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,838
I have seen the movie 11 times.
Have you seen it?

202
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,076
Dilip Kumar and Madhubala starrer.
You must see it

203
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,511
If you are in love,
you'll get a 20 percent discount

204
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,238
Dad, I'm broke.
Can I get a grand?

205
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,239
A grand? What for?
- To watch a movie

206
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,518
Movie? All right

207
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,236
Here's 1000 bucks. Make sure
you get seats at the corner

208
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,229
Corner seats, Vicky

209
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,951
Why are you telling him?
- He's the one I'm going with

210
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,955
Bloody punk! Two idiots will sit
at the corner and watch a movie?

211
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,077
You ought to be ashamed!
- What for?

212
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,512
If a boy wants to watch a movie,
he should watch it only with a girl

213
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,078
Else, it'd be like embarrassing the
movie, the theatre and the audience

214
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,594
What easy?
C'mon, stand together

215
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,394
Put your hand over
his shoulders... smile

216
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,637
Look at each other, lovingly

217
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,960
You make a nice couple, but it
won't do here. It'll work in America

218
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,397
It's legal there... two boys
going around hugging each other

219
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,755
If you want to stay here in India
with your papa...

220
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,710
go outside, find a nice girl
and tell me that you like her...

221
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,231
that you love her...
and I'll give you 10,000 bucks

222
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,996
10,000 bucks? Sure?
- Sure

223
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,036
Would you go out for a movie with me?
Evening show, corner seats

224
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,915
We'll clap. It'll be fun.
- A movie? With you?

225
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,235
I do, every morning!

226
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,239
Not my fault though.
He asked me to do this

227
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,948
What's your problem?
Shall I take you to some doctor?

228
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,078
Doctor? What for?
- Why aren't there girls in your life?

229
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,236
Because I haven't yet come across
my kind of girl

230
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,032
Dad, pick up the phone

231
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,077
I'm Delhi talking to Mady

232
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,633
Dad...
- Yes?

233
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,638
I have found her

234
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,231
Who?
- My kind of girl

235
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,596
Some meetings
leave behind memories...

236
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,238
and promises

237
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,236
Some meetings...

238
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,515
give you a feeling
of a new beginning

239
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,032
I saw her again

240
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,237
Something surely existed between us

241
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,872
But what was it?

242
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,593
Let's go and meet the groom

243
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,077
You just refused a while ago

244
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,236
I have changed my mind

245
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,033
I have a feeling that
my life is about to change

246
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,958
Who's that girl?
- My wife

247
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,869
Not her. The girl behind me

248
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,430
I see. She's Rina Malhotra

249
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,720
She's a chartered accountant.
Works at Delhi Fort

250
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,475
There was a time when
I was after her

251
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,316
What rubbish!
You're hopeless

252
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,035
Aren't you ashamed?
It's your wedding today

253
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,589
I know

254
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,957
Amazing beauty

255
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,077
Tell you a secret...
- What?

256
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,035
She's so pretty...
nobody is watching you and your wife

257
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,231
Everyone is watching her

258
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,909
Is that what you came here to say?
- Yes

259
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,909
I realised it in the morning itself.
You emptied an entire film roll on her

260
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,633
You saw that?

261
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,238
Now that you know,
why don't you introduce her?

262
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,958
Introduce a girl to you?
- Yes, yes

263
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,838
You are baptized

264
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,238
What do you guys take me for?

265
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,236
Did you guys think I was a?
- Right

266
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,235
C'mon, introduce me to her.
- Let go! It's my wedding

267
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,508
All right, I spare you for your
wedding's sake. Now introduce me

268
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,077
Later.
- Later?

269
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,429
Later, you are not going to listen
even to your father

270
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,878
It's your nuptial-night

271
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,236
You will vanish in thin air.
Don't laugh

272
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,832
If you don't introduce me later...

273
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,032
I'll sneak into your room in the night
and burst crackers. Remember

274
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,038
May I leave now?
Bye sister-in-law

275
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,918
Hey...
- Bye

276
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,269
Hey wait...

277
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,076
Wonderful!

278
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,234
What a babe!

279
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,913
What's her name?
- Rina

280
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,758
Did you talk to her?
- No

281
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,792
Did she talk to you?
- No

282
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,116
Did your eyes meet?
- No, man

283
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,751
She must've seen you at least.
- No

284
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,075
Damn!

285
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,950
For all your flings, you are a
bloody loser! Total waste of time

286
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,953
You'd rather have gone for a girl
at the market. Want me to set it up?

287
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,713
Shut up

288
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,958
Have I ever discussed a girl?
- No, gentleman

289
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,716
There were so many girls in college.
Those sexy girls from Delhi...

290
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,277
Wow!
- Everyone in college were after them

291
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,279
Not once did I cast a glance at them.
- You didn't

292
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,790
Who's that girl staying opposite?
- A good-looking Gujarati girl

293
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,036
Yes.
- Patel

294
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,475
Namita Patel.
- Right, scoundrels

295
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,714
For her, the guys in the neighbourhood
have even altered their schedules

296
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,877
Did I ever say hi to her?
- Never

297
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,272
But this time I'm telling you...

298
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,236
this girl's very different

299
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,236
The small silver bindi
on her forehead!

300
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,391
That cute killing smile!

301
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,832
That stylish sari wrapped around her!

302
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,236
Those beautiful delicate legs!

303
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,798
Her flowing tresses!
- Stop it!

304
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,078
Stop barking! What's your problem?
- Not a word more

305
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,835
Why not?
- Because right here, another man...

306
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,792
will enter your love-story

307
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,996
I'm also beginning to like her

308
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,349
No jokes...

309
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,750
I can't believe it.
- If I say more...

310
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,031
you won't believe it at all.
- Mady...

311
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,078
tonight, even if you say that
Madonna gave you a massage...

312
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,749
I'm gonna believe it.
- Hands off

313
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,712
I'm not Madonna. Lay off

314
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,718
Yes?
- The girl by Rina's side is amazing

315
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,355
She is out of focus.
- Then let's set the focus right

316
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,951
Damn, that's something invisible

317
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,555
Wonderful! It's amazing, Mady.
- Awesome!

318
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,913
I haven't shown you anything yet.
Hold on

319
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,032
I saw something up there

320
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,750
Don't tell me that
your days have turned so bad...

321
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,759
that you've resorted
to stealing cups from bars

322
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,075
Shut up

323
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,075
Look...

324
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,076
the mark of lipstick.
- So what?

325
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,035
Didn't get it?
- No

326
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,079
It's the same cup with which Rina...
- What?

327
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,479
Drank water

328
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,235
Show me

329
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,239
Shut up!
- Oh come on

330
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,951
You should've brought the plate too
with which she had her meals

331
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,236
We'd have made a photoframe
and hung it up the wall

332
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,558
It would've made a nice modern
abstract art, a symbol of love too

333
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,717
Blockhead!
- Come off it

334
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,753
What matters is he finally
found a girl for himself

335
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,997
He hasn't found her yet.
- Hang on...

336
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,909
before this pretty woman
finds herself a beau, we must act

337
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,033
Mady, I can read your face

338
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,432
If you don't have this girl
in your life, your life will be ruined

339
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,720
All right,
but what am I to do?

340
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,748
When it comes to ideas,
you remember D. D

341
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,955
So the idea is, friends;
pack your stuff, book your tickets...

342
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,238
leave for Delhi and find Rina.
- Let's go

343
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,955
No, dad

344
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,955
I hear that
when you fall in love...

345
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:20,671
only one channel is relayed
from the heart... Love

346
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,234
Great

347
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,474
Only one face lingers
before your eyes... the lover's

348
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,710
It's happening to me,
albeit slowly

349
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,913
Because, I can still see
your rotten faces

350
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,909
In my opinion, I must wait
for a few more days...

351
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,592
to confirm whether it is infatuation
or true love

352
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,116
What say? Until then,
Delhi can wait

353
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,948
See that? Their dads blow up
their ill-gotten wealth in liquor

354
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:59,035
And these girls blow up their
dads' money in gas

355
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,676
Stop screaming. I'll overtake them.
- Don't be stupid

356
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,996
If they fall off their motorbikes
there will be people to pick them up

357
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,273
If you and I fall...
- We'll have pallbearers to pick us up

358
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,070
What good was all that smoke?
Finally, you are stuck up in traffic

359
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,711
For all the fun and frolic...

360
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,231
you girls have to finally halt
at the wedding signal

361
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,236
Are you tied up?

362
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,638
See? She spoke to me

363
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,398
We only smoke beedis.
- Beedis! It doesn't stink?

364
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,389
It does. A few swills of whiskey
takes care of the stink

365
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,829
It's her!

366
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,835
It's her!

367
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:09,033
Mady! The next seven generations
of yours will be born naked and bald

368
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:14,918
Your children will go begging
for combs and clothes!

369
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,633
Where's my specs?

370
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,433
Found it!

371
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,032
I can see now

372
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,430
Damn! Who hung the
trucker's picture here?

373
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,238
Moron! Did you find
only my truck to die?

374
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,593
Smartass! Take off your glasses
and look around

375
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,916
Did you find only my motorbike
to run over?

376
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,071
Why are you sucking the lemon?

377
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,909
Because my blood pressure dipped

378
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,308
Why the hell did you hang it there?
- For the truck to run properly

379
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,797
I see. How many organs
does your truck carry?

380
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,913
Organs? You mean spare parts?
750

381
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,750
If your truck cannot run properly
on 750 spare parts...

382
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,031
you think a lemon would help?

383
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,039
Trying to con me, eh? Pandey!
- That's me, sir

384
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,960
Not you... I called him.
Arrest him

385
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,714
One minute. Let go,
I'm not going to flee

386
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,913
Do you have 200 bucks?
- 200!

387
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,953
They won't agree on anything less.
- I gave all I had...

388
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,714
at the previous signal.
- Really? How about...

389
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,231
paying him back in the same coin?
- Stop murmuring, will you?

390
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,712
Hands off. Don't touch me

391
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,638
Prasad! Hands off

392
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,076
I know the Police Commissioner

393
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,238
He doesn't know me though

394
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,510
Is Shruti there? No?

395
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,038
When did she leave?
Okay, bye

396
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,958
What do you think you are doing?
- Mind your own business

397
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,316
I got drubbed because of you

398
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,955
Listen to me...
- Drop dead

399
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,955
You go your way, I go mine.
You are the malefic planet in my life

400
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,989
You are the malefic planet in my life!
What more do I say?

401
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,788
I hate you. I'm off.
- I'll buy you a beer

402
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,958
I love you. You are my best friend.
I go your way

403
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,238
You are a real gentleman.
- Look!

404
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,237
That's the Delhi girl. Rina

405
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,236
And the girl with her...
Your out-of-focus

406
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,955
Let's go and talk to them

407
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,748
Sure, but only I'll talk, okay?
- Sure

408
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,429
I'll have my eyeful.
- Come on...

409
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,959
Where did she go?

410
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,236
All because of you!
You aren't my friend

411
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,473
Drop dead!
You go your way, I go mine

412
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,357
Where did she go?
- Lost the beer!

413
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,711
I saw her again.
- Who?

414
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,876
The Delhi girl.
My kind of girl

415
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,195
Really?

416
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,755
I'm coming

417
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,236
I was with Vicky on the motorbike
when I saw her

418
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,959
Where?
- On the road

419
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,952
Then?
- I got off the bike and followed her

420
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,952
Then?
- She went into a shopping complex

421
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,235
Then?

422
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,596
How much for this cassette?
- Free of cost

423
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,037
I too went into the shopping complex.
- Then?

424
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,670
Then she vanished.
- Damn it!

425
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,792
That costs 530 bucks

426
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,714
I let go a golden opportunity.
- Damn

427
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,073
Tell you something... my heart
has been playing only programme

428
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,237
What programme?
- Rina

429
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,957
Only one face lingers before me...
- Whose face?

430
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,474
Rina's

431
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,835
I think I'm in love.
- Gracious! My son is in love

432
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,952
Your cassette is free

433
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,955
I haven't yet found the girl.
- You will, now that you are in love

434
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,630
Don't bathe, just wear a perfume
and take off

435
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,593
Your love's working.
- What!

436
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,836
The girl is in the supermarket.
- Where?

437
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,634
Dumbo! Supermarket.
- I'll be right there

438
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,912
How much for this?

439
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,669
Is she the one?
I'll hit you

440
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,550
She's not the one,
but she is her friend

441
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,514
We can take her help and...
man, you are confusing me

442
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,713
Let me explain. Look boss,
it's simple

443
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,071
If you want to meet the boss,
woo the peon

444
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,755
If you want to enter a bungalow,
woo the watchman

445
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,680
Likewise, if you want
to reach Rina...

446
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,352
you must woo her
out-of-focus friend. Come on

447
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,031
I'm Vicky, I want to have
a word with you

448
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,909
I don't mean to bother you.
Just want a bit of information

449
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,958
Information? What kind?
- Mady is my solid friend

450
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,033
And Rina is your solid friend.
Mady, say something

451
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,911
Your friend, Rina...
we are family friends

452
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,238
Thick friends.
- I'm talking

453
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,077
Actually, for the last few years...

454
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,951
there has hardly been
a contact with them...

455
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,236
there's a bit of...
- A rift

456
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,389
Yes

457
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:06,469
Yesterday, we saw the two of you
inside the shopping complex

458
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,032
Okay, you do the talking.
- Actually...

459
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,236
I'm talking, aren't I?
- Go ahead

460
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,953
We saw you... and when we thought
of coming over and talking to you...

461
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,033
the two of you just vanished.
- In thin air!

462
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,954
My family is supposed to perform
and important ritual soon...

463
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,635
If we could only get Rina's
phone number in Delhi

464
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,955
Delhi number?

465
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,674
You are telling me that
you are Rina's close friends...

466
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,237
but I'm surprised that you don't know
that Rina has been posted in Mumbai

467
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,237
That's what I was saying

468
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,234
Of late Rina is posted in Mumbai

469
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,878
If I could get the phone number...
- 6223222

470
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,716
Are you really her friends? Or?
- To tell you the truth...

471
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,230
we lied to you, but you know,
my best friend...

472
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,909
wants to be your best friend's
best friend, that's why...

473
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,714
Forget that number right now!

474
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,630
Madam, listen to me.
Ever since my friend has seen her...

475
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,956
he has gone crazy.
- Stop it, stop it

476
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,589
See that? He doesn't eat,
he won't let us eat either

477
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,678
He gets dead drunk, but he won't...
- It's all right

478
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,032
He won't buy us a drop of liquor.
- You are maligning me

479
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,873
Bloody zombie!
- Shut up

480
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,031
If you don't help him, this man will...
- Idiot!

481
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,510
That's your father.
- How dare you?

482
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,679
Try calling her up, try meeting her,
try talking to her...

483
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,516
but she won't talk to you.
- Is she dumb?

484
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,116
Rina's wedding has been fixed

485
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,390
Her parents have found
a match for her

486
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,958
I tell you, stop this farce
and forget Rina

487
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,398
You are neither emptying the stones
nor filling up the sea

488
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,512
Your efforts are going in vain

489
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,229
Vicky...

490
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,596
I never imagined that
a girl would walk into my life

491
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:15,032
I never ever imagined that
she'd right away walk out of my life

492
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,229
She's gone?

493
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,229
You are raving. It's out of question
since she doesn't belong to you

494
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,554
Why don't you go and meet her?
- Meet her?

495
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,709
And tell her what? Want me
to sing a melancholy before her?

496
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,950
Her parents have fixed her wedding,
she wouldn't talk to a stranger...

497
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,475
what am I supposed to tell her?

498
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,953
You are such a waste.
Look, I bunked college...

499
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,953
lied to my parents, bought
movie tickets in the black market...

500
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,716
What are you getting at?
- And took you to watch Titanic

501
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,957
What do you figure out?
Zero

502
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,998
What happens in Titanic?

503
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,715
Tell me, what happens in the movie?

504
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,953
A slink woos
an already engaged girl...

505
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,795
from right under her fiance's nose,
in just three days

506
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,878
Did anyone find out?

507
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,589
Okay, but what happens in the end?

508
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,957
Who drowned? The slink, right?

509
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,592
Not only Titanic, in real life too,
it is only the boys who drown

510
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,915
You dig?

511
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,035
What?
- Get lost

512
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,236
Tells me Titanic's story

513
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,513
How do I explain?

514
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,229
What?

515
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,235
Listen

516
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,996
It's the new law of the year 2001

517
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:40,598
Any boy who truly loves a girl...

518
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,236
will certainly find her

519
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,556
All right, give me her phone number

520
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,958
And your birth date?

521
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:54,918
Gotcha! You remember her phone number
but you don't remember your birth date

522
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,558
If not love, what is it, Mady?

523
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,633
Listen to me

524
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,555
Catch the love-wave signal

525
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,799
Pick up the phone
and dial the number

526
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,509
Her heart's gonna sing, I tell you

527
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:59,510
I'm calling from the exchange.
Is your line clear?

528
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:00,835
Yes, clear

529
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,436
Is the telephone working?
- Yes

530
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,552
Would you tell me your address?

531
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,832
So what's he saying?

532
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,236
Nothing.
- What do you mean?

533
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:21,075
Said, he wants to meet me,
he's coming next week

534
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:25,234
He'd want to meet me
before our parents fix the wedding

535
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:34,956
Flirting after the parents have
given their consent is so much fun

536
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,796
But this is more romantic;
you haven't even seen the man...

537
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,230
yet thinking of him and blushing...

538
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:50,036
But you must've approved of him, no?
When is this hero of yours coming?

539
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:54,755
I don't know. Before I could even
say something, it got disconnected

540
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,031
At least you should've told him
that you approve of him

541
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,913
Why didn't you say that you do?

542
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,038
Should be him

543
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,034
I'll handle this affair

544
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,515
One moment

545
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,995
Rajiv, this is Shruti.
Rina's best friend

546
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,756
I would like to tell you something
before Rina does

547
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,031
The two of you must meet

548
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:29,955
In fact, go around together,
get to understand each other

549
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,953
Rajiv, you have seen
Rina's latest photograph

550
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,236
But the last time she saw you was
when you were kids

551
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,710
She has no idea how you look

552
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,038
And all she knows is that you are
her papa's best friend's son...

553
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,749
and you are coming over next week
from Seattle, America

554
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,475
But why next week?

555
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,952
Wrong number, I guess

556
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,830
No good.
I know these type of girls

557
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,430
The father decides
which school she will study in

558
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,836
The mother decides the number
of plaits on her hair

559
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,913
And the entire family decides
on who she will marry

560
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,430
There! He's concluded the story

561
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,437
Moron! The conclusion could be
a new beginning too. Just shut up

562
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,238
Tell me honestly

563
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,510
Do you really love Rina dearly?

564
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,918
You said the she hasn't
seen the boy yet

565
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,229
She hasn't

566
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:45,909
Not after seven days,
Rajiv is arriving tomorrow

567
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,398
I mean, you will meet Rina
posing as Rajiv

568
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,429
And you'll tell her that you
flew down before schedule

569
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,748
Then, she's going to spend few days
with this Rajiv

570
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,350
And in this duration
you will have to win your game

571
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,350
You will tell her
what you feel about her

572
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,756
You will pour your heart
out to her

573
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,034
lmpress her. It should make her
love you the way you love her

574
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,230
True love never returns empty-handed

575
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,231
And once she
falls in love with you...

576
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,670
tell her that you are
not Rajiv but Mady

577
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,599
This is deceit

578
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,757
No. This is love

579
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,236
And in love, the person is important,
not the name

580
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:32,039
Now look; call me D. D or daddy...

581
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,239
call me Deen Dayal or Shiv Shankar,
hardly makes a difference

582
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,749
Once the relationship of love is built,
names and numbers cease to exist

583
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:48,238
One more thing.
You have no other way out

584
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:54,915
D. D, your brain
is still working. I admit

585
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,919
No wonder you've fixed
the missing link

586
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,952
However, just think...

587
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:03,078
in the interim,
if the real Rajiv...

588
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,040
calls up Rina from America
even once...

589
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,556
what would happen to the imposter?

590
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,036
That's not going to happen

591
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:17,035
Now that I have climbed up here,
will I find my way down? I'm scared

592
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,072
Cut the wire!
Else, I'll cut you up

593
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,231
I can't see a thing

594
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:25,913
Take of your glasses, switch on
the light, and you will see!

595
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:30,637
Sure. I'll meet you later and box
your ears for landing me in a soup

596
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,752
The phone's ringing

597
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,550
Could be the American.
Cut the line!

598
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,035
Hey...

599
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:20,795
Now what?

600
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,032
Who's sending these?

601
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,874
At least tell me
who's sending these

602
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,075
Now what?

603
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,595
Don't you guys have a job to do?

604
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,758
Some idiot seems to be sending flowers
and you guys keep delivering it

605
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,032
The idiot is here

606
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:54,077
Love, romance and amour, eh?

607
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,037
Trying to express your love
by sending flowers, right?

608
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,640
By the way, how much did you spend?

609
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,038
132 dollars

610
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,435
Dollars?
- Yes

611
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,554
Please leave

612
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,396
But you were supposed
to arrive next week?

613
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:30,076
Right. The flights were
going empty, so I rushed here

614
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,032
May I come in?

615
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,234
Lovely flowers

616
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,630
I chose these flowers
exclusively for you

617
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,638
I like this style

618
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,636
You were to arrive next week, right?
- Yes

619
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,275
Do your parents know
about his surprise?

620
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,234
Yes... actually, Rina...

621
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,948
I wanted the two of us to meet
and get to know each other well...

622
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:28,034
and tell our parents. So I didn't
inform them about this trip

623
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,231
And, well...

624
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,236
I have five days to spare

625
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,234
And I wish to spend every moment
of it with you

626
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,796
So that we can get to know
each other well

627
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:44,910
I was wondering if it is possible
for you to take five days off

628
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:49,068
I'll try. I'll call my boss.
He might agree

629
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,951
Oh, I forgot. The phone's not been
working for two days now

630
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:58,392
And I haven't yet complained.
- Obviously, it won't work

631
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:02,389
I mean, phones in India
are always dead

632
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,955
But that's not the case in America.
Over there, people might die...

633
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,999
talking continuously over the phone,
but the lines never get disconnected

634
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,397
How about going out for lunch?
- Sure. Shall I go and change?

635
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:25,635
I'm a pure Brahmin.
Will I eat chicken? No way

636
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,236
Is that okay?
Any other chicken dish?

637
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:33,278
Why not order some vegetarian dish?
The vegetarian fare here is fantastic

638
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,036
But your dad said that you
like Chinese chicken...

639
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,231
that's why I ordered chicken

640
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,235
Bloody butcher!

641
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,076
Am I going to defy my faith
for the sake of a girl?

642
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,233
We have met before.
Do you remember?

643
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,838
At a wedding in Delhi

644
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,758
When I was eight years old

645
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:11,751
You and your friends had locked me up
inside a dark room. Remember?

646
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:15,476
Your dad then gave you a cool scolding.
- Of course, I remember

647
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,953
You and your friends used to
pull up such stupid pranks

648
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,636
That was long back.
- Lucy was my best friend then

649
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,560
You remember Lucy?
- Yes! Our Lucy...

650
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:38,236
Lucy was my dog

651
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,238
Exactly! The tall dog...

652
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:47,918
Sorry, my memory is very weak

653
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,111
I'm famished. Shall we eat?

654
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,035
Absolutely

655
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,475
No! No! Don't!

656
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,918
No! No!

657
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,628
Nice chicken, no?

658
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,033
Okay now! Round two

659
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:14,596
What took you so long?
Is everything okay?

660
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:17,389
No problem at all.
I'm fine

661
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:22,038
Rajiv, how far is
Chicago from Seattle?

662
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,878
How far is Chicago from Seattle?

663
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,914
Couldn't she have asked
an easy question?

664
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:32,475
You don't know?
You've never been to America?

665
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:36,635
It's very closeby

666
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,230
It takes me only one and a half hours
when I'm driving

667
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:45,590
All the cops out there know me.
No one stops me

668
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,310
An airplane reaches even faster

669
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:52,516
You land before you even take off,
even before you take a seat

670
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,960
Why are you asking?
- My friend is married...

671
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:59,636
and settled in Chicago.
- We'll go there

672
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:02,918
I'll take you there.
- No, I don't want to go

673
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,238
Why not?
- I want to stay here in Mumbai

674
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:11,637
Why? Don't want to go abroad?

675
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:20,719
Staying there, working there...
I'm not too keen

676
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:24,032
Nothing like our Mumbai

677
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:29,716
That's like it.
It opens up avenues for me

678
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,115
Enjoy

679
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:20,236
I've been waiting for an hour now

680
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,634
Last night we had a party...
I just slept away...

681
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,958
the alarm didn't buzz,
the bike didn't start...

682
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,032
I kept on kicking...

683
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,635
I think I was expecting
too much from you

684
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,874
Don't be so serious.
I'm late, that's it

685
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:40,588
I have to go. Bye.
- Sure. On my motorbike

686
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:44,231
It has five gears...
not an autorickshaw!

687
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,752
Rina, come out please.
We'll go on our bike

688
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:48,837
It's a really good bike.
Soft, and imported

689
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,037
Look, it's so nice

690
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:57,636
Stop, man!
Don't you have a girlfriend?

691
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:59,235
Moron

692
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,438
So what's the plan?

693
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,713
Don't touch the meter.
- I know it's made of gold

694
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,832
Don't touch the meter, he says!

695
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,752
Good Lord! It's so hot

696
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:23,351
I mean, I'm sweating. How do
you guys manage such a hot weather?

697
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,951
You got mineral water, boss?

698
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:27,880
I drink only mineral water
in America
