- I told 'em just what I thought about 'em.

168
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,224
"My client is right,"
I said, " and you know it.

169
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:46,921
But what do you care about people,
as long as you can fill your pockets?"

170
00:14:46,995 --> 00:14:51,329
No wonder they say this is
the worst city, with politicians
like Gil Warren running things.

171
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,767
- And how did the fine gentleman like that?
- Oh, he was sweatin' plenty.

172

- " Sure," I said. " What do you
care about Chicago being bad...
- Take the handle.

"as long as business is good
and you've got all the beef
and pork in the world?

174
00:15:01,576 --> 00:15:04,568
"But I'll tell you this. It takes more than
those things to make this a great city.

175
00:15:04,646 --> 00:15:07,114
"It takes people with
some sense of decency...

176
00:15:07,182 --> 00:15:09,946
to make this not only the biggest city
in the world, but the best."

tongue you ha'...

178
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:15,081

that proud of you.

I'll do the same for you.

Hey, Ma! It's me!

188

- [Laughing] Hello, Ma!
- Howdy, Mrs. O'Leary.

189

- Hi, Jack.
- Hello, Pickle.

190

- Sorry you lost your case, Jack.
- Lost?

191
00:15:53,528 --> 00:15:57,430
Sure. I, uh... I forgot to tell you.
The judge dismissed it.

192
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:00,127
Heaven help me. And all the time
I thought he'd won it.

193
00:16:00,202 --> 00:16:03,262
Don't worry. Warren won't
hold it against you, as long as you lost.

194
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:06,171
I heard about it. A fella said Jack
had the courtroom hypnotized.

195
00:16:06,241 --> 00:16:08,266
Yeah, everybody
but the judge.

196
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:12,245
Had him too, only Gil Warren
put him on the bench.

197
00:16:12,314 --> 00:16:14,407
Keep your hand
away from that.

198
00:16:14,483 --> 00:16:16,951
But, Ma, it's just
the right size.

199
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:20,785
- Ma, for the last time, will you
quit this laundry business?
- Why should I be quittin'?

200
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:23,916
'Cause I don't want my best girl
bending over a washtub all her life.

201
00:16:23,992 --> 00:16:27,018
- Go along with you now.
- I'll tell you what I'll do.

202

I'll get you a new place, out of the Patch,

Huh? Look. Look, Ma.

204
00:16:35,003 --> 00:16:37,369
- Where did you get that money?
- A fellow paid me.

205
00:16:37,439 --> 00:16:40,499
You're lyin'. You've been gambling
at that racetrack again.

206
00:16:40,575 --> 00:16:42,805
There wasn't
any gambling to it, Ma.

207
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:45,176
There are only eight horses in the race...
mine and seven others.

208
00:16:45,247 --> 00:16:47,977
- All we had to do was shoot the other seven.
- Hmph!

209
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,383
Huh, indeed. Come on, Ma.
How about it, hmm?

210
00:16:51,453 --> 00:16:54,854
- I'll not be livin' on money
that isn't honestly got.
- Give us a kiss then, huh?

211

Look at it.
I told that Gil Warren...

214
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:11,069
I wouldn't wash any more tablecloths
they'd been drawing pictures on.

215
00:17:11,139 --> 00:17:14,006
- Send it back.
- Wait a minute. This looks like a map.

216
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:17,170
Maybe Warren's gonna hunt
for a buried treasure.

217
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:20,078
Hunt for it? He's already found it
in the city treasury.

218
00:17:20,148 --> 00:17:22,309
Something about
Randolph Street...

219
00:17:22,384 --> 00:17:24,409
<i>and</i>...<i>and Madison.</i>

220
00:17:24,486 --> 00:17:27,478
This looks like the tracks
for the horse car line.

221
00:17:27,556 --> 00:17:29,649
I know what it is.

222
00:17:29,724 --> 00:17:32,716
This means they're gonna run
the car line along Randolph Street.

223
00:17:32,794 --> 00:17:35,661
You're crazy. They've already surveyed
Madison for the tracks.

224
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,666
Sure, they have. That's exactly
what makes me think they're
gonna run along Randolph.

225
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:41,998
- By golly, maybe you're right.
- Of course I'm right!

226
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:45,437
That's the way they cheat the people...
get them to invest on Madison Street...

227
00:17:45,507 --> 00:17:48,203
and then switch the line
by their own property.

228
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:52,007
- What an idea.
- You're right. This information
is worth a fortune.

229
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,878
- Ha! Listen to him.
- And I'm gonna get part of it.

230
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,111
You with your fine talk
and your grand plans...

231
00:17:57,185 --> 00:17:59,449
not a penny ever honestly
earned to your name.

232
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:02,115
Maybe so. But if I had
this corner here...

233
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,023
where all the traffic meets,
I'd put up the biggest saloon in town.

234
00:18:05,093 --> 00:18:09,189
- Saloon?
- And free beers to you, Mrs. O'Leary.

235
00:18:09,264 --> 00:18:11,232
I wouldn't be stepping
my foot inside.

236
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,735
Then I guess we'll have to keep on
rushing the growler for you.

Oh, but look.

238
00:18:17,005 --> 00:18:19,701

in right on my corner.

240
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,212
- B. Fawcett.
- Ever heard of him?

241
00:18:26,281 --> 00:18:28,806
No. It's a new one on me.

242
00:18:33,388 --> 00:18:36,949
- Stop it! Stop it! Are you out of your mind?
- I've gotta have this name.

243
00:18:37,025 --> 00:18:40,392
We'll go down to Gil Warren's
and see what we can find out
about this Fawcett fellow.

244
00:18:40,462 --> 00:18:44,159
- You've ruined it!
- There was already a hole in it, Mrs. O'Leary.

00:25:24,766 --> 00:25:27,496
- Listen to it. Ow!
- Oh, you fool.

325
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:29,560
I'm trembling all over.

326
00:25:29,637 --> 00:25:33,403
And I wanna be calm and cool
so I can make you understand.

327
00:25:33,474 --> 00:25:37,240
Say, are you
on the level?

328
00:25:37,312 --> 00:25:40,304
Absolutely.

329
00:25:40,381 --> 00:25:43,350
- But I don't even know who you are.
- Does that matter?

330
00:25:43,418 --> 00:25:46,353
It does to me.
And I'll tell you another thing.

331
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:51,415
- I didn't like that cheap
trick you pulled on me.
- I had to talk to you alone.

332
00:25:51,492 --> 00:25:54,586
What gave you the idea you could
make love to me like this?

333
00:25:54,662 --> 00:25:59,759
Just give me a chance.
I'll tell you the whole story.

334
00:25:59,834 --> 00:26:03,736
All right. You can stop here
and buy me a drink.

335
00:26:03,805 --> 00:26:06,239
No, not here.
It's too crowded.

336
00:26:06,307 --> 00:26:08,400
Since you've
taken me by storm...

337
00:26:08,476 --> 00:26:13,038
the least you might do is to take me
to your place so we can really talk.

338
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:17,574
Very well, but your story
had better be good.

339
00:26:19,354 --> 00:26:23,188
All right, George. You can drive
to Miss Fawcett's home.

340
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,054
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

341
00:26:31,265 --> 00:26:33,392
- So this is where you live?
- Yes.

342
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:36,460
<i>Way up there</i>
<i>on the second floor.</i>

343
00:26:36,537 --> 00:26:38,801

344
00:26:38,873 --> 00:26:41,501

- Let's tell Ma.
- <i>Ja.</i> You want to?

354

- You scamp. Takin' the best ironer I ever had.

355
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:29,780
Well, if it's love
you're after...

356
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:31,950
I guess a few shirts and tablecloths
can't stand in the way...

357
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:34,756
but I won't have you sittin' around
and waitin' and not eatin'.

358
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:38,629
You'll be gettin' married right away
and I want no back talk about it.

359

Now, give me that pail.

- Sure, Mike... with you.

00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:06,385

for me that you're slickin' your hair...

Well, you want me

368

Oh, but, Ma, it's a beaut.
Look. "D.V.S."...Who's that?

373
00:28:27,718 --> 00:28:30,278
His name is Swift and he sells pigs.
Now take it off.

- [Laughs]

378
00:28:44,535 --> 00:28:47,629
Ma! Say, Ma!
I won my first case!

379
00:28:47,705 --> 00:28:50,731
- I knew you would!
- Congratulations.

380
00:28:50,808 --> 00:28:53,038
The jury wasn't out
more than 15 minutes...

381
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,738
and the judge said it was the finest
speech he's heard all session.

382
00:28:55,813 --> 00:28:59,840
So did the lawyer from
the other side. And... yippee!

383
00:28:59,917 --> 00:29:02,351
Congratulations. I always
knew you had it in your tongue.

384

A fellow from the <i>Tribune</i>
said he's gonna write it up.

385
00:29:04,488 --> 00:29:06,513
- You're gonna get your name in the paper?
- Yes!

386
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,581
- How much did you get?
- Huh?

387
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:11,924
- How much did you get?
- You did get paid for it, didn't you?

388
00:29:11,996 --> 00:29:15,762
The fellow only makes $10 a week,
and he's got a wife and a family.

389
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:18,893
Ten dollars a week?
That's just $10 more than you make.

390
00:29:18,969 --> 00:29:22,427
- I couldn't take his money, could I?
- I give up.

391
00:29:22,506 --> 00:29:25,998
I've got one son that steals
my laundry and spends his money
heaven knows where...

392
00:29:26,076 --> 00:29:29,102
another a lawyer and wins cases
and don't get paid for them.

393
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:33,207

she can keep her job.

395
00:29:35,786 --> 00:29:38,846
- Night, Ma. Don't sit up for me.
I may be late.
- Hmm.

396
00:29:38,923 --> 00:29:40,185
Huh, indeed.

397
00:29:40,257 --> 00:29:43,886
Where's he going
all dressed up?

398
00:29:43,961 --> 00:29:49,024
Where is any of us going?
And where is it all going to end?

399
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:52,125
For one thing, we can
be going in to supper.

400

I've been begging Father
to bring me here for the opening.

- I'm glad he did.
- It's marvelous.

- Please do.

Gentlemen, you give me The Senate,
I give you Chicago.

505
00:39:03,954 --> 00:39:06,787
Father says you're the smartest
young man in Chicago.

506
00:39:06,857 --> 00:39:09,690
That's because he knows
I'll deliver the Patch on Election Day.

507
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,628
He says you have a great future, as big
as Gil Warren's if you do as he says.

508
00:39:13,697 --> 00:39:16,461
He's the boss, and one
of America's finest.

00:39:16,533 --> 00:39:19,900
- And now... I must change my costume.
- Allow me.

<i>I want to talk to you, my boy.</i>
<i>I have some great plans in store.</i>

511
00:39:23,707 --> 00:39:27,734
Surely not tonight, Senator,
when you have so beautiful
a daughter to entertain us.

512
00:39:27,811 --> 00:39:31,645
Father won't talk business
if I ask him not to. Will you, darling?

513
00:39:31,715 --> 00:39:34,684
I can't imagine the senator doing
anything that you asked him not to.

514
00:39:34,751 --> 00:39:38,847
That's right. She wraps me around
her finger all the time.

515
00:39:42,225 --> 00:39:44,716
Uh, excuse me, please.

516
00:39:44,795 --> 00:39:47,127
- I'll be right back.
- We'll expect you.

517
00:39:47,197 --> 00:39:51,691
He's nice-looking, isn't he?
I mean, for someone from the Patch.

518
00:39:53,403 --> 00:39:55,598
- Hello, Warren.
- Why, hello, son.

519
00:39:55,672 --> 00:39:59,233
- Mr. O'Leary.
- Jim-dandy place you've got here.

520
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:03,075
- Thanks.
- Nothing like it in Chicago. I'm proud of you.

521
00:40:03,146 --> 00:40:07,446
- You mean, you're not sore?
- Why, no. I've come over to bury the hatchet.

522
00:40:07,517 --> 00:40:10,680
Live and let live...
that's my motto.

523
00:40:10,754 --> 00:40:14,588
- Come on. Have a drink.
- Matter of fact, I wanted
a word in private with you.

524
00:40:14,658 --> 00:40:17,923
- Oh, sure. Come on in my office.
- See you in a minute, Rondo.

525
00:40:17,994 --> 00:40:20,656
Rondo, step up to the bar.
Anything you want, on the house.

526
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,960
Thank you, Mr. O'Leary.

527
00:40:23,033 --> 00:40:26,525
- How old are you, son?
- Old enough to vote. Why?

528
00:40:26,603 --> 00:40:29,629
I was just thinking,
you've come along mighty fast.

529
00:40:29,706 --> 00:40:32,834
When I was your age,
do you know what I was doing?

530
00:40:32,909 --> 00:40:36,675
I was rounding up runaway slaves
and practically starving to death.

531
00:40:36,746 --> 00:40:40,546
- Sit down, Gil.
- Take it from me, times have changed.

532
00:40:40,617 --> 00:40:44,713
- Everything's youth today.
- Well, you seem to have done pretty well, Gil.

533
00:40:44,788 --> 00:40:49,589
I've managed, but you've got a great future
ahead of you. Mark my words.

534
00:40:49,659 --> 00:40:51,923
Well, I hope you're right.

535
00:40:51,995 --> 00:40:55,897
I don't blame you for taking Belle.
She's a great woman.

536
00:40:55,966 --> 00:41:00,494
I'd have married her if I'd had the chance,
but she never cared for me.

537
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:04,563
- <i>It was just a business deal,</i>
<i>and you outbid me.</i>
- What's on your mind?

538
00:41:04,641 --> 00:41:10,307
What would you say, son, if I told you
I was gonna close The Hub, quit?

539
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,848
I'd say you were up to something.
What is it?

540
00:41:12,916 --> 00:41:16,010
I'm thinking of
running for mayor.

541
00:41:16,086 --> 00:41:17,747
Mayor?

542
00:41:17,821 --> 00:41:20,312
I've been electing them
long enough.

543
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:23,917
Now I'm going to elect myself,
if you'll ride along with me.

544
00:41:23,994 --> 00:41:27,760
- How do I come in?
- You're a smart young fella.

545
00:41:27,831 --> 00:41:31,323
If you watch your step, you're going
to be a big power in this town.

546
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:35,770
I could build a bigger place and give you
trouble, but I've had all I want of this.

547
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,434
- You say the word, and I'm through.
- You close The Hub?

548
00:41:39,509 --> 00:41:42,740
Exactly, and give you
an open field.

549
00:41:42,812 --> 00:41:45,838
Now, we either work together
politically or fight it out.

550
00:41:45,916 --> 00:41:48,407
It's up to you.

551
00:41:48,485 --> 00:41:52,353
It's a nice place you have here,
but, like a tinder box...

552
00:41:52,422 --> 00:41:56,358
touch a match to it, and it'll go off
like a Roman candle.

553
00:41:56,426 --> 00:41:59,953
But what the devil? Chicago is big enough
for both of us and more.

554
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:02,726
Together we could run
this town and run it right.

555
00:42:02,799 --> 00:42:06,462
You, Belle and me pulling together,
it'd be a lead pipe cinch.

556
00:42:06,536 --> 00:42:09,630
Yeah. Sounds all right.

557
00:42:09,706 --> 00:42:13,039
But naturally there's a little expense
involved, and right now with the...

558
00:42:13,109 --> 00:42:16,442
I took the liberty of bringing
my check for $10,000.

559
00:42:16,513 --> 00:42:21,576
There'll be more between now
and election time.

560
00:42:21,651 --> 00:42:24,950
I think we'll manage
very well, Your Honor.

you were talking about.

Come on.

563
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:34,224
Now, Belle, you've got to come
to my table right now...

564
00:42:34,297 --> 00:42:37,232
and have a bottle
of wine with me.

565
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:40,633
I'd love to, but you'll have to
excuse me for one minute.

00:42:44,741 --> 00:42:47,335
Hello. I thought I
saw you come in here.

00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:50,504
I was just telling Dion
what a great place you've got.

569
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:53,481
I never saw you
looking so beautiful.

570
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:56,747
- I always did say she was the
best looker Chicago ever saw.
- Thanks.

571
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:00,119
Better watch yourself, son.
I'll get her back if I can.

572
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:04,183
- But it looks like it won't be to The Hub.
- Gil's closing The Hub for good.

- Really? Why?

I wouldn't worry about
that if I were you.

Sure, and I'll vote for him
myself, if necessary...

- Good morning.
- Good morning.

- Everything fixed?
- The district attorney said if you're worried...

632
00:48:17,553 --> 00:48:20,852
he'll let us have witnesses to prove
Mitch hasn't been in Chicago in two years.

- The fool doesn't know how to walk?
- And the judge appointed...

641
00:48:40,109 --> 00:48:42,100
somebody to take his place
and I don't know who.

642
00:48:42,178 --> 00:48:44,840
- What's this mean?
- It means it ain't fixed.

643
00:48:44,914 --> 00:48:46,973
Oh, come on.

644
00:48:48,684 --> 00:48:51,676
In view of the unavoidable
detention of the district attorney...

645
00:48:51,754 --> 00:48:54,086
the court has appointed
a special counsel...

646
00:48:54,156 --> 00:48:57,648
a representative
of the Election Reform Committee...

647
00:48:57,727 --> 00:49:00,855
in the case of <i>The City</i>
<i>of Chicago v. Edward Mitchell.</i>

648
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:03,865
<i>Mr. O'Leary, are you</i>
<i>prepared to proceed?</i>

649
00:49:03,933 --> 00:49:07,562
- We're ready, Your Honor.
- Oh, yes.

650
00:49:07,637 --> 00:49:11,198
- Is the defense ready?
- Uh, Your Honor...

651
00:49:11,274 --> 00:49:14,505
Your Honor, certain matters
have come up.

652
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:19,014
New evidence have been uncovered
that compels me to...

653
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:20,742
Go ahead with the trial.

654
00:49:20,816 --> 00:49:22,841
- Go ahead?
- Proceed.

655
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:25,318
The defense is ready,
Your Honor.

656
00:49:25,388 --> 00:49:28,380
You may proceed,
Mr. O'Leary.

657
00:49:30,993 --> 00:49:35,157
Your Honor, it is no secret
that multiple voting...

658
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:37,222
for years has been
a common practice...

659
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,791
in that section of Chicago
known as the "Patch."

660
00:49:39,869 --> 00:49:45,239
So common, it has come to be regarded
as one of the minor evils...

661
00:49:45,308 --> 00:49:47,299
in that district.

662
00:49:47,376 --> 00:49:50,834
Men who occupy the highest
offices in this city...

663
00:49:50,913 --> 00:49:53,677
openly and brazenly
bid against each other...

664
00:49:53,749 --> 00:49:55,683
for that very vote.

665
00:49:55,751 --> 00:50:01,053
Any mention of it is dismissed
with an indulgent smile...

666
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:04,854
as something that
should not be talked about.

667
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:07,896
There are men in this very courtroom,
Your Honor...

668
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:11,524
who control every election
in this city...

669
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,659
with such illegal votes.

670
00:50:13,736 --> 00:50:16,830
Men who sit in their
fine saloons...

671
00:50:16,906 --> 00:50:20,307
surrounded by every luxury
that money can buy...

672
00:50:20,376 --> 00:50:22,867
or that they can steal...

673
00:50:22,945 --> 00:50:28,508
while public officials bow and smile
before them and fight for their favor.

674
00:50:28,584 --> 00:50:33,521
Until today, nobody has ever obtained
sufficient evidence to convict them.

675
00:50:33,589 --> 00:50:37,047
Now, however, we have
an eyewitness...

676
00:50:37,126 --> 00:50:39,959
who was actually present
when the defendant, Edward Mitchell...

677
00:50:40,029 --> 00:50:43,692
<i>was caught attempting to register</i>
<i>under four different names</i>...

678
00:50:43,766 --> 00:50:47,896
The last time,
as the beloved
Bishop Cornwall himself.

679
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:51,565
- <i>[Laughter]</i>
- You know, he's really good.

680
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:55,167
- Some day he'll be a great lawyer.
- I think he's all right now.

681
00:50:55,244 --> 00:50:57,804
Mr. Clerk, call Carrie Donohue
to the stand.

682
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,849
<i>Carrie Donohue</i>
<i>take the stand.</i>

683
00:51:04,387 --> 00:51:07,845
- She can't do this to me.
- Shh! Quiet!

684
00:51:08,924 --> 00:51:10,949
Stand up. Raise your
right hand.

685
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:13,119
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth...

686
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,220
- so help you God? What's your name?
- I do.

687
00:51:15,297 --> 00:51:17,288
- Carrie Donohue.
- Sit down.

688
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:21,302
- Miss Donohue, you know this defendant?
- Do I know him?

689
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:24,430
- Hmph! That big squirt.
- None of that now.

690
00:51:24,507 --> 00:51:26,600
- I'll haul off...
- Quiet!
- [Laughter]

691
00:51:26,675 --> 00:51:30,543
- <i>[Clerk] Order in the court.</i>
- Refrain from personal remarks.

692
00:51:30,613 --> 00:51:32,945
Tell the court what you know
about this man's registration.

693
00:51:33,015 --> 00:51:35,176
- Well, my gentleman friend's...
- Face the judge.

694
00:51:35,251 --> 00:51:38,311
hired to watch the registration
and I'm keeping him company...

695
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:40,548
when this big squirt
walks in.

696
00:51:40,623 --> 00:51:44,252
- <i>[Laughter]</i>
- Well, he don't see me
and I don't say anything...

697
00:51:44,326 --> 00:51:47,318
but when he keeps comin' back,
I get suspicious...

698
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:51,662
and I'm just about to tell my friend
that something funny's going on...

699
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:54,532
when, sure enough,
back he comes again...

700
00:51:54,603 --> 00:51:57,037
and, this time,
he says he's a bishop.

701
00:51:57,106 --> 00:51:59,768
- Well, that's too much even for me.
- <i>[Laughter]</i>

702
00:51:59,842 --> 00:52:01,776
- <i>[Banging Gavel]</i>
- <i>[Clerk] Order in the court.</i>

703
00:52:01,844 --> 00:52:03,971
- That's what you get for marrying 'em.
- You married to this woman?

704
00:52:04,046 --> 00:52:06,037
- What?
- Can you imagine it?

705
00:52:06,115 --> 00:52:08,811
- Ever divorce her?
- No!
- Your Honor!

706
00:52:08,884 --> 00:52:11,580
May it please the court,
we ask that this woman's testimony...

707
00:52:11,654 --> 00:52:13,645
be stricken
from the records...

708
00:52:13,722 --> 00:52:16,350
and this case dismissed
on the grounds that the law says...

709
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:18,950
a wife cannot testify
against her husband!

710
00:52:19,028 --> 00:52:24,898
- <i>That woman is my client's</i>
<i>lawful-wedded spouse.!</i>
- Madam, is this true?

711
00:52:24,967 --> 00:52:27,629
- <i>[Crowd Murmuring]</i>
- Well, I married him once,
if that's what you mean...

712
00:52:27,703 --> 00:52:29,671
- <i>but I can tell you</i>...
- <i>That will do.</i>

713
00:52:29,738 --> 00:52:32,764
- Well, I mean that he...
- That will do.

714
00:52:32,842 --> 00:52:35,242
Well. Hmph.

715
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:39,274
Mr. O'Leary,
you distinctly told me...

716
00:52:39,348 --> 00:52:43,114
that you had had time to familiarize
yourself with all the facts in the case...

717
00:52:43,185 --> 00:52:46,643
and, yet, you take up this court's time
allowing your only witness...

718
00:52:46,722 --> 00:52:49,418
to testify, although
she's clearly unqualified.

719
00:52:49,492 --> 00:52:53,622
Your Honor, I assure you, this is
as much a surprise to me as it is to you.

720
00:52:53,696 --> 00:52:56,130
I ask the court's pardon.

721
00:52:56,198 --> 00:52:58,894
Case dismissed.

722
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,185
- Tough break, kid.
- Yeah.

723
00:53:05,257 --> 00:53:08,693
- Congratulations.
- Aw, you can never
tell about these women.

724
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,320
They'll put it over on you every time,
if they can...

725
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:14,524
but you were great yourself,
I was proud of you.

726
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,296
Wait'll I go after the big fish,
the higher-ups...

727
00:53:17,369 --> 00:53:19,894
- then you'll really hear something.
- That's the way to talk.

728
00:53:19,972 --> 00:53:23,408
- How about meeting Belle?
- It's about time.

729
00:53:23,475 --> 00:53:25,943
Belle, this is brother Jack.
Jack, Miss Fawcett.

730
00:53:26,011 --> 00:53:29,845
- How do you do?
- I've been looking forward
to this for a long time.

731
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:32,349
- You have?
- Yes.

732
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,647
Dion isn't the only admirer
of beauty in the family.

733
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,711
- [Laughs]
- Thank you.

734
00:53:36,788 --> 00:53:38,847
- That was a very nice thing to say.
- I couldn't help...

735
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,949
but look at you
all through the trial.

736
00:53:41,026 --> 00:53:44,621
- Maybe that's why you lost your case.
- [Laughs]

737
00:53:44,696 --> 00:53:47,324
- Uh, can we drop you someplace?
- Oh, no. No thanks.

738
00:53:47,399 --> 00:53:50,664
I've, uh... I've got some things
to do here in the building.

739
00:53:55,307 --> 00:53:58,572
You know, it seemed kind of funny,
you and Dion on one side...

740
00:53:58,644 --> 00:54:00,578
and me on the other,
fighting each other.

741
00:54:00,646 --> 00:54:02,910
[Laughs]
When we were kids,
we were always fighting.

742
00:54:02,981 --> 00:54:04,972
I bet if any other Irishers tried
to horn in...

743
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:07,041
it was the O'Learys
against the world.

744
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,247
- Oh, you said it.
- You two must've had fun
when you were little.

745
00:54:10,322 --> 00:54:12,882
- We still do.
- Even though we don't
always see eye-to-eye.

746
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:15,153
Well, I've got
to leave you here...

747
00:54:15,227 --> 00:54:17,024
but I'll tell ya what you do,
Miss Fawcett...

748
00:54:17,095 --> 00:54:19,427
- or shall I call you "Belle"?
- Please do.

749
00:54:19,498 --> 00:54:22,365
Let Dion bring you up the house
some time for dinner, meet Ma.

750
00:54:22,434 --> 00:54:24,459
Well, I'd be
delighted.

751
00:54:24,536 --> 00:54:26,561
I wanna show you
some pictures of Dion...

752
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:28,629
in his First Communion
suit at the age of nine.

753
00:54:28,707 --> 00:54:31,198
And some of you without any suit
at all at the age of six months.

754
00:54:31,276 --> 00:54:34,439
[Laughing]

755
00:54:34,513 --> 00:54:37,573
I wish you'd keep
an eye on this fellow for us.

756
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:41,210
He's getting up in the world so fast,
it might go to his head.

757
00:54:41,286 --> 00:54:44,255
I'd kind of hate
to have to knock it off.

758
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:46,314
I'll try.

759
00:54:46,391 --> 00:54:48,723
Good-bye.
See you soon.

760
00:54:48,794 --> 00:54:51,354
Good-bye, Jack.

761
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,660
- You know, I like him.
- They don't make 'em any better.

762
00:54:57,736 --> 00:55:00,068
That was nice of him,
wanting me to meet your mother.

763
00:55:00,138 --> 00:55:02,072
Well, yes. I've been thinking
about that myself.

764
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:04,904
Oh, don't. I understand how
she feels about me.

765
00:55:04,976 --> 00:55:07,672
Oh, Ma's all right...
A little old-fashioned, perhaps.

766
00:55:07,746 --> 00:55:09,737
Oh, please.

767
00:55:09,815 --> 00:55:12,682
I had no idea he was so...
so human.

768
00:55:12,751 --> 00:55:15,618
Oh, sure.
Takes after me.

769
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:17,678
You know, there's something
almost normal about him.

770
00:55:17,756 --> 00:55:21,157
He just looks so real, you know
he believes everything he says.

771
00:55:21,226 --> 00:55:24,423
Honestly, it just makes me sick
to think of a man like Gil Warren...

772
00:55:24,496 --> 00:55:27,863
trying to run Chicago when there
are men here like your brother.

773
00:55:27,933 --> 00:55:30,766
Can you imagine the mayor
he'd make if he had the chance?

774
00:55:30,836 --> 00:55:34,033
Well, if he hadn't gotten mixed up
with that reform crowd...

775
00:55:34,106 --> 00:55:36,131
Wait a minute.

776
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:38,608
- I've got an idea.
- What?

777
00:55:38,677 --> 00:55:41,111
I just thought what do with that check
Gil Warren gave me.

778
00:55:41,179 --> 00:55:43,238
Back to The Senate.

779
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:48,709
In brief, we've come here
to ask you to run for mayor.

780
00:55:48,787 --> 00:55:52,985
- What?
- We have canvassed the field,
and you're the man we want.

781
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:56,755
Well, this is all
very flattering, gentlemen.

782
00:55:56,828 --> 00:55:59,160
May I... May I ask
whom you represent?

783
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,358
The respectable
people of Chicago...

784
00:56:01,433 --> 00:56:04,163
citizens who want a new deal
in our city administration.

785
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:06,363
We're organizing
a reform party.

786
00:56:06,438 --> 00:56:09,999
- I'm not sure I'm the man.
- We're willing to take that chance.

787
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:14,444
- It's a great opportunity.
- Decent people are waiting
for an honest program.

788
00:56:14,513 --> 00:56:18,210
You'll carry every district, except,
perhaps, Gil Warren's Patch.

789
00:56:18,283 --> 00:56:20,251
I'm not so sure
he won't get that too.

790
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:23,185
Your brother's influential there.
Surely he'll support you.

791
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:25,951
I'm afraid you can't
count on my brother.

792
00:56:26,024 --> 00:56:28,788
You see, we O'Learys
are a strange tribe.

793
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:31,226
- Then we'll win without the Patch.
- Chicago needs you.

794
00:56:31,296 --> 00:56:34,390
- Yes, Mr. O'Leary.
- Will you do it, sir?

795
00:56:36,368 --> 00:56:38,962
Thank you, gentlemen.
I'll run.

796
00:56:39,037 --> 00:56:41,972
[All Voicing Approval]

797
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:44,736
[Laughing]

798
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:47,677
What did he say when you suggested
that I would support him?

799
00:56:47,746 --> 00:56:51,011
- He said he's afraid he couldn't figure on you.
- [All Laughing]

800
00:56:51,082 --> 00:56:53,983
Well, at least he's agreed to run.
That's the first step.

801
00:56:54,052 --> 00:56:57,385
What worries me is,
can you control him once he's in?

802
00:56:57,456 --> 00:57:00,653
He's a pretty stubborn
young fellow.

803
00:57:00,725 --> 00:57:04,456
You leave that to me.
We O'Learys are a strange tribe.

804
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:11,932
- How's that?
- Not bad.

805
00:57:12,003 --> 00:57:15,063
Of course, it doesn't
look much like you.

806
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:19,338
"Jack O'Leary, candidate for mayor.
Reform ticket."

807
00:57:19,411 --> 00:57:23,575
That's a great thing for Chicago.
I'd like to help.

808
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:26,708
- You help me?
- Sure. Why not?

809
00:57:26,785 --> 00:57:30,050
If other people say you're good enough
to be mayor, I'm not going to say no.

810
00:57:30,121 --> 00:57:32,919
Of course, I couldn't
support you openly.

811
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,118
You know how I feel
about the Patch.

812
00:57:35,193 --> 00:57:37,354
Oh, of course.
No strings attached.

813
00:57:37,429 --> 00:57:41,695
- The fact you're my brother
wouldn't mean a thing.
- Stop arguing, will you?

814
00:57:41,766 --> 00:57:44,030
If you stood in the way of something
I felt oughta be done...

815
00:57:44,102 --> 00:57:47,731
I'd go after you as fast as I would
after anybody else, maybe faster.

816
00:57:47,806 --> 00:57:52,937
Because I'm in dead earnest. I see Chicago
as a great city people can be proud of.

817
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:55,138
I'd wipe out
all this mushroom growth...

818
00:57:55,213 --> 00:57:58,273
start all over on a sound basis,
with steel and stone.

819
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:00,818
You don't have to make
speeches to me, Jack.

820
00:58:00,886 --> 00:58:03,446
I just wanted you
to know where I stand.

821
00:58:06,091 --> 00:58:08,719
- Well, how much do I owe you?
- I'm two games up on you.

822
00:58:08,793 --> 00:58:12,786
Ah. Twenty cents.
What a gambler.

823
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:15,567
- It's in the blood.
- [Laughing]

824
00:58:15,567 --> 00:58:16,158
- It's in the blood.
- [Laughing]

825
00:58:16,234 --> 00:58:21,001
Say, why don't you get Belle
and come to the house tonight
and take her and Ma for a drive?

826
00:58:21,072 --> 00:58:24,735
- Ha! You know Ma.
- We'll get a couple of beers under her belt.

827
00:58:24,809 --> 00:58:27,369
Well, heaven help us
if it doesn't work out.

828
00:58:27,445 --> 00:58:31,176
[All Singing]

829
00:58:44,429 --> 00:58:48,661
[Continues]

830
00:58:52,504 --> 00:58:57,908
[Ends]

831
00:58:57,976 --> 00:59:00,137
[All Laughing]

832
00:59:00,211 --> 00:59:02,975
- To His Honor, the future mayor.
- To Chicago!

833
00:59:03,048 --> 00:59:05,915
And to herself,
the first lady of the city!

834
00:59:05,984 --> 00:59:07,975
Oh, to the lot of you!

835
00:59:08,053 --> 00:59:12,956
- The compliments
of the season to you, ma'am.
- Oh, go on. More presents.

836
00:59:13,024 --> 00:59:16,118
You should see the grand house
we're gettin' for you. Inside plumbing.

837
00:59:16,194 --> 00:59:20,130
- And a butler in short pants.
- Heaven help me.

838
00:59:20,198 --> 00:59:22,189
<i>It's himself.</i>

839
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:24,258
- <i>Pa.!</i>
- <i>It looks just like him.</i>

840
00:59:24,336 --> 00:59:26,804
- Sure got my nose.
- [Laughs]

841
00:59:26,871 --> 00:59:29,931
I can remember the day we took it
like it was yesterday...

842
00:59:30,008 --> 00:59:32,272
and the trouble we had
puttin' the collar on him.

843
00:59:32,344 --> 00:59:35,245
- Well, Ma, where are we gonna hang him?
- Hang him?

844
00:59:35,313 --> 00:59:39,215
You'll do no such. He's gonna
spend the rest
of his days on this organ.

845
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:43,050
- [All Laughing]
- If he only could have seen it himself.

846
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:46,648
Isn't he beautiful?
I want the baby to see it.

847
00:59:46,725 --> 00:59:48,750
[Coos]

848
00:59:50,228 --> 00:59:53,163
Look, that's
your grandpa.

849
00:59:53,231 --> 00:59:56,792
Aw, Pat,
would you believe it?

850
00:59:56,868 --> 01:00:00,167
And Bob
just a baby himself.

851
01:00:00,238 --> 01:00:04,800
If you turn out half as good as the blood
that's in you, I'll not complain.

852
01:00:04,876 --> 01:00:07,606
You know, Ma,
it looks like Pa had...

853
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:09,874
sort of a roving eye
for the ladies.

854
01:00:09,948 --> 01:00:12,746
I'll thank you to keep
a civil tongue in your head.

855
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:15,308
Roving eye, ha!
I'd like to catch him.

856
01:00:15,387 --> 01:00:19,551
- [Blubbering]
- Look.

857
01:00:19,624 --> 01:00:22,991
You're so good to me, the lot of you.
You'll have me in tears.

858
01:00:23,061 --> 01:00:26,690
- Oh, Ma. Beer always did make you cry.
- Listen to him.

859
01:00:26,765 --> 01:00:29,563
We'll play him a tune,
his favorite one.

860
01:00:29,634 --> 01:00:32,102
- Come on, Ma, and play it.
- Come on, the four of you.

861
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:35,662
We'll show him a thing or two.
The O'Learys against the world.

862
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:38,800
- [Together]
The O'Learys against the world!
- We will. Come on, Ma.

863
01:00:41,746 --> 01:00:44,476
[Laughing]

864
01:00:45,817 --> 01:00:49,776
[Irish Jig]

865
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,836
You should've seen your father dance,
as light as a canary...

866
01:01:12,911 --> 01:01:15,345
and stealing a kiss
before you could shut your eyes.

867
01:01:15,413 --> 01:01:17,938
And the fair Molly Callahan
loving it, I'm thinking.

868
01:01:18,016 --> 01:01:19,950
And why shouldn't I
be loving it?

869
01:01:20,018 --> 01:01:23,784
Himself as fine a man as ever stood up
with a girl in front of an altar.

870
01:01:23,855 --> 01:01:25,948
And that's what
you should be doin'.

871
01:01:26,024 --> 01:01:29,084
- That's what I was telling him today.
- Is it herself, you mean?

872
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,596
I met Miss Fawcett. She's a fine woman.
You oughta know her.

873
01:01:32,664 --> 01:01:35,929
Hmm. I will not. And her workin'
in a saloon like any hussy.

874
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,197
- Oh, that's not fair, Ma.
We're living in modern times.
- That's right.

875
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:42,933
Don't forget, things have changed
since you were a girl. This is 1870.

876
01:01:43,007 --> 01:01:45,532
Times may have changed,
but I haven't changed.

877
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:48,738
And I don't want any daughter-in-law
that's the talk of the town...

878
01:01:48,813 --> 01:01:52,214
and kickin' her heels
in the air for anyone to see.

879
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:59,955
When you were a little one, no bigger
than that, and me over a tub...

880
01:02:00,024 --> 01:02:03,824
I used to dream of the day when you'd
bring me home a sweet one...

881
01:02:03,895 --> 01:02:07,888
and her all blushes,
and present me with fine grandsons...

882
01:02:07,966 --> 01:02:11,299
as would be like sons
of my own, only sweeter.

883
01:02:11,369 --> 01:02:13,701
It's my own life, Ma.

884
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,871
Who'll have some more beer?

885
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:20,968
- Me.
- I wouldn't mind another drop.

886
01:02:21,045 --> 01:02:23,479
<i>[Knocking]</i>

887
01:02:23,548 --> 01:02:26,949
Here, Ma.
Put a head on it.

888
01:02:27,018 --> 01:02:30,510
<i>Good evening, Mr. Jack.</i>
<i>Will you tell Mr. Dion his buggy's here?</i>

889
01:02:30,588 --> 01:02:33,751
- <i>Oh, thanks.</i>
- He'll be right out.

890
01:02:33,825 --> 01:02:38,159
Now, Ma, drink your beer and forget
about it, and let's go for a ride, huh?

891
01:02:38,229 --> 01:02:40,857
Oh, sure.
How about it, Ma?

892
01:02:40,932 --> 01:02:44,595
- That I will.
- Oh, fine. I'll get your coat and hat.

893
01:02:44,669 --> 01:02:47,137
Aw, Ma.

894
01:02:47,205 --> 01:02:49,765
There you are.

895
01:02:49,841 --> 01:02:52,674
[Laughs]
Drink it all, Ma.

896
01:02:54,846 --> 01:02:57,110
Come on, Ma.

897
01:02:57,182 --> 01:03:00,208
Now, First Lady, I've got
a real surprise for you...

898
01:03:00,285 --> 01:03:02,845
two of the fastest fillies
you ever sat behind.

899
01:03:02,921 --> 01:03:06,118
Now, close your eyes and get inside.
Close 'em. Up one step. There you go.

900
01:03:06,191 --> 01:03:11,527
Inside. Ma, this is Miss Fawcett.
This is Belle.

901
01:03:11,596 --> 01:03:15,692
- Hmm! So it's a trick.
- No, wait a minute!

902
01:03:15,767 --> 01:03:19,533
You're going to meet Belle, so you
might as well get used to the idea.

903
01:03:19,604 --> 01:03:22,573
- The devil I will. Let me out.
- Ma, you always were so stubborn.

904
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,700
If you don't stop it,
I'll give you the licking of your life.

905
01:03:25,777 --> 01:03:29,008
- Well, you don't think
I'm gonna ride with her!
- Oh, come back here!

906
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:32,607
- [Shouting]
- Sit down! Driver, drive on! Drive on!

907
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:36,176
[Molly]
Let me out! Let me out, I say!

908
01:03:36,254 --> 01:03:40,247
- Sit still!
- Let me out! Stop it, I tell you!

909
01:03:40,325 --> 01:03:42,350
I won't be treated
this way!

910
01:03:42,427 --> 01:03:44,861
You Irish lunkhead!
What do you think you're doing?

911
01:03:44,929 --> 01:03:49,229
My son an Irish lunkhead?
How'd you like to be treated?
You with your grand manners.

912
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:52,394
Just as any woman who's going
to be his wife has a right to be treated.

913
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:57,533
<i>He'll never marry you. And now,</i>
<i>if you'll stop, I'll be takin' my leave.</i>

914
01:03:57,609 --> 01:04:00,305
- Stop here.
- Whoa!

915
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,746
- Wait. I'll get out.
- You'll do no such.

916
01:04:04,816 --> 01:04:08,343
It's you who'll be saving
the wear and tear of walking.

917
01:04:09,821 --> 01:04:12,756
- Ma.
- Hmm!

918
01:04:12,824 --> 01:04:15,384
How could you?

919
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:19,328
I'm sorry. I didn't think
Ma would act like that.

920
01:04:21,666 --> 01:04:23,634
Take me home, please.

921
01:04:30,642 --> 01:04:33,543
My friends...

922
01:04:33,611 --> 01:04:36,774
this campaign
has resolved itself...

923
01:04:36,848 --> 01:04:40,784
into one
clear-cut issue.

924
01:04:40,852 --> 01:04:44,379
Shall the Patch
run Chicago...

925
01:04:44,455 --> 01:04:48,357
or shall Chicago
run the Patch?

926
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:53,227
I promise you
that if I am elected...

927
01:04:53,298 --> 01:04:56,699
the Patch will
either be cleaned up...

928
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:59,931
or it will be wiped out
like that.

929
01:05:00,004 --> 01:05:02,666
- <i>[Man] Hooray for Gil Warren.!</i>
- <i>[Laughter]</i>

930
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:05,208
- Who said that?
- Shh, shh.

931
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:09,303
- Oh, it's a shame.
- The trouble with him is
he looks too honest.

932
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:12,611
People never trust
an honest man in office.

933
01:05:12,684 --> 01:05:15,778
Well, I wish
he hadn't tried it.

934
01:05:15,853 --> 01:05:17,844
He'll never beat Warren.

935
01:05:17,922 --> 01:05:20,288
Never say never
about politics.

936
01:05:20,358 --> 01:05:23,156
What are you up to now?

937
01:05:23,227 --> 01:05:25,718
Well, I was just wondering
what would happen...

938
01:05:25,797 --> 01:05:29,563
if all Gil Warren's ward heelers
and poll watchers and repeaters...

939
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:31,932
failed to show up
on Election Day.

940
01:05:32,003 --> 01:05:36,235
- What do you mean?
- He wouldn't stand much chance
of being elected, would he?

941
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:38,502
George, drive
to Commissioner Beavers'.

942
01:05:39,877 --> 01:05:43,813
Gil Warren's my friend.
I won't do it. I can't.

943
01:05:43,881 --> 01:05:47,510
I won't do it! I can't!
I'll be ruined forever.

944
01:05:47,585 --> 01:05:51,453
For doing your duty? Oh, come, come,
Commissioner. Be a man.

945
01:05:51,522 --> 01:05:53,513
He'll kill me.

946
01:05:53,591 --> 01:05:57,550
Besides, what you're asking is against
the law, against all my principles.

947
01:05:57,628 --> 01:06:00,756
You've been getting $100 a week
for doing what I tell you.

948
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:03,198
Every cent I got
was in cash.

949
01:06:03,267 --> 01:06:08,000
Sure, I paid you in cash, but I always
sent it by a different man.

950
01:06:08,072 --> 01:06:10,233
What? What do you mean?

951
01:06:10,308 --> 01:06:14,608
Those 15 or 20 people would make fine
witnesses if you ever got any ideas.

952
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:17,614
Blackmail, eh?

953
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:20,082
All right. I'll fight.

954
01:06:23,888 --> 01:06:26,914
Go ahead. Fight.

955
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:33,456
And you'll be back pounding

01:19:37,401 --> 01:19:39,426
Oh, this just fits
in my trunk.

1115
01:19:39,503 --> 01:19:43,030
Now, Miss Belle, ain't a bit of use
in you carryin' on like this.

1116
01:19:43,106 --> 01:19:46,667
- Ain't no man worth it!
- Oh, Hattie, hurry, will you?

1117
01:19:46,743 --> 01:19:48,768
<i>I'm hurryin', honey.</i>

1118
01:19:53,517 --> 01:19:56,145
- Get out of here!
- I'm gettin' out, honey.

1119
01:19:56,219 --> 01:19:59,552
- Get out of here!
- Belle, don't act like that.

1120
01:19:59,623 --> 01:20:02,439
- <i>[Hattie Screaming]</i>
- Belle, I want to talk to you.

1121
01:20:02,572 --> 01:20:05,769
- Hattie, get out of the way!
- [Hattie Screaming]

1122
01:20:05,842 --> 01:20:09,471
- Get him away from me!
- Get out of here, white man!

[All Screaming]

1124
01:20:12,482 --> 01:20:16,942

- Murder! Police! Help!

1125
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:19,284
- Get out!
- Belle, please.

1126
01:20:19,356 --> 01:20:21,654
I'm sorry,
but I had to come.

1127
01:20:21,725 --> 01:20:25,491
Just let me say one thing,
then you can put me out. I won't care.

1128
01:20:25,562 --> 01:20:28,963
- Oh, please go.
- I don't ask you to forgive me.

1129
01:20:29,032 --> 01:20:32,195
I've said and done things
no woman could ever forgive.

1130
01:20:32,269 --> 01:20:35,329
But you've got to believe
I love you, Belle.

1131
01:20:35,405 --> 01:20:38,238
I always have
and I always will.

1132
01:20:38,308 --> 01:20:41,038
Oh, why talk about it?

1133
01:20:41,111 --> 01:20:43,170
But you said you loved me.

1134
01:20:43,246 --> 01:20:45,305
That's over.

1135
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:48,146
You can't change in a moment
any more than I can.

1136
01:20:48,218 --> 01:20:51,153
We can't do
without each other.

1137
01:20:51,221 --> 01:20:53,883
I can.
I'll make myself.

1138
01:20:53,957 --> 01:20:58,189
Oh, we've fought, and maybe we'll
go on fighting, but we'll do it together.

1139
01:20:58,261 --> 01:21:01,162
We were meant
for each other.

1140
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:04,029
Belle, marry me.

1141
01:21:05,235 --> 01:21:07,430
Now. Tonight.

1142
01:21:07,504 --> 01:21:10,996
I've got the license
and the ring.

1143
01:21:11,074 --> 01:21:14,271
We'll go to Jack,
have him marry us.

1144
01:21:14,344 --> 01:21:16,335
Will you, Belle?

1145
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:19,980
Oh, my darling!

1146
01:21:20,050 --> 01:21:23,383
Come on, Mr. Policeman.
Right in here. She...

1147
01:21:27,057 --> 01:21:29,184
She's done
backslid again.

1148
01:21:31,361 --> 01:21:36,264
Do you realize that 75%
of the buildings in the Patch...

1149
01:21:36,333 --> 01:21:38,927
are made of pine?

1150
01:21:39,002 --> 01:21:42,267
There are no sewers,
no hydrants.

1151
01:21:42,339 --> 01:21:45,638
Nothing but filth, cesspools.

1152
01:21:45,709 --> 01:21:50,840
But worst of all,
it is a veritable firetrap.

1153
01:21:50,914 --> 01:21:55,783
Now, that sort of thing
may have been excusable when
Chicago was just beginning...

1154
01:21:55,852 --> 01:21:58,013
but that time has passed.

1155
01:21:58,088 --> 01:22:01,080
Today it's a menace
to a great city...

1156
01:22:01,157 --> 01:22:04,126
a cancer
that must be cut out.

1157
01:22:04,194 --> 01:22:07,186
Now, I propose to condemn
the whole district...

1158
01:22:07,263 --> 01:22:09,891
wipe it out
and start all over again.

1159
01:22:09,966 --> 01:22:13,197
- Yes, what is it?
- [Whispering]

1160
01:22:13,269 --> 01:22:15,965

I'll be right out.

1161
01:22:17,941 --> 01:22:21,069
Will, uh, you gentlemen
go ahead with the discussion...

1162
01:22:21,144 --> 01:22:23,874
and excuse me
for a little while, please?

1163
01:22:23,947 --> 01:22:26,313
Yes, Mr. Mayor.

1164
01:22:29,986 --> 01:22:32,648
Well, Jack, you've won.

1165
01:22:32,722 --> 01:22:36,249
- I've won what?
- I've been a fool.

1166
01:22:40,630 --> 01:22:43,997
I wouldn't take a million
for this moment.

1167
01:22:44,067 --> 01:22:47,298
Now it's really the O'Learys
against the world.

1168
01:22:47,370 --> 01:22:50,168
Well, here's the little
lady who's responsible.

1169
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:52,572
As if I didn't know it.

1170
01:22:52,642 --> 01:22:57,306
As the mayor of this great and noble city,
can you marry people?

1171
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:59,848
Marry?

1172
01:22:59,916 --> 01:23:02,908
Why, sure!

1173
01:23:04,087 --> 01:23:06,749
Wait a minute.
I'm not so sure.

1174
01:23:06,823 --> 01:23:08,814
- But I'll find out.
- [Rings Bell]

1175
01:23:08,892 --> 01:23:11,554
What a mayor.

1176
01:23:11,628 --> 01:23:15,064
Is there anything in the charter
about whether the mayor
can perform a marriage?

1177
01:23:15,131 --> 01:23:19,500
- I don't know, sir, but I'll find out.
- Hurry up and find out!

1178
01:23:19,569 --> 01:23:24,006
"Having taken these pledges
of your affection and vows of fidelity...

1179

- I don't have to tell you how lucky you are.
- That's right.

01:23:49,599 --> 01:23:52,591
- I just want to say congratulations.
- Thank you.

and... good night.

1188

Congratulations.
Good night.

1189
01:23:58,441 --> 01:24:02,002

how much all this means to me.

1190
01:24:02,078 --> 01:24:05,172
Remember that day
I told you he wasn't so bad?

1191
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:08,240
The O'Learys
are a strange tribe.

1192
01:24:08,318 --> 01:24:10,786
Right.
[Laughing]

1193
01:24:10,854 --> 01:24:13,550

and tell Ma, huh?

1194
01:24:13,623 --> 01:24:18,788
Sure, but first there's just one
little matter I'd like to clear up.

1195
01:24:18,862 --> 01:24:23,162
And now, Mrs. O'Leary, suppose
you go ahead and testify against me?

1196
01:24:23,233 --> 01:24:25,997
[Laughing]
Listen to him.

1197
01:24:26,069 --> 01:24:29,800
You didn't think I was gonna
let you two get away with it, did you?

1198
01:24:29,873 --> 01:24:33,468
- Why, Dion!
- Go ahead with your grand jury investigation.

1199
01:24:33,543 --> 01:24:36,569
She's my wife,
and you know the law...

1200

against her husband. [Snickering]

and you along with it!

1211

- Yes, sir. I've sent for the police.

1212
01:25:46,950 --> 01:25:50,215
I don't want the police!
Get the city attorney!

1213

the condemnation proceedings.

want to see your face again!

Get the police commissioner.
Tell him to swear in 500 special deputies.

1216
01:26:00,229 --> 01:26:03,426
Get the newspapers. Tell them that when
I get through with the Patch...

- <i>there won't be a stick</i>
<i>or stone left standing.</i>

- What?

Yeah, Jim Fellows
just came by to tell us.

1228

Dion and Jack have had
a knock-down, drag-out fight
about the Patch.

1229

- And them grown-up and brothers.
- I'm gonna find 'em.

him against his own people.
