00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:22,423
#Is there any way
out of this dream #

176
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:43,082
#Summer #

177
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:48,422
#Is dragging its feet #

178
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:53,191
#I feel so incomplete #

179
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:58,862
#Is there any way out #

180
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:02,634
# Of this #

00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:06,006

[Clock Ticking, Faint]

183
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:27,532
[Hank] You know, Frannie,
I think a vacation adventure...

184
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,966
would be a very good idea
for us.

185
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:36,232
Actually, this is a pretty solid house,
isn't it?

186
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:39,402
I mean, this is a good house.

187
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,809
- Well, this house could be made...
- You know, in Bora-Bora, there's no...

188
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,814
- Sorry. Go ahead.
- Go ahead.

189
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:49,047
- No. You go.
- Well, you see, that's the thing.

190
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,520
- Mm-hmm.
- This could be a good investment.

191
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,024
Mm-hmm.

192
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:57,789
I know. If we could afford it.

193
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:02,231
What do you mean?
We bought it. It's ours.

194
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,701
You bought it.

195
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:08,136
[Mutters]

196
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,334
- But with our money.
- Huh?

197
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:17,645
Our money? You spent our money
without asking me?

198
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:24,645
- What did you buy the tickets with?
- Those tickets are something special.

199
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:29,358
I got a discount on the tickets.

200
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,989
Trust me, honey.
I know best.

201
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,123
Oh.

202
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:39,500
By the way, happy anniversary.

203
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:43,166
Happy anniversary.

204
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:48,241
When I first met you, Hank,
I thought,

205
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,372
this is not the guy for me.

206
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:54,714
No way. You didn't look like him.
You didn't talk like him.

207
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,584
You weren't him.

208
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,226
"Him"?

209
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:06,025
- You know. Prince Charming.
- [Chuckles]

210
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:11,636
But I started to like you anyway.

211
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,575
And then I started to love you.
'Cause you were nice.

212
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:23,310
- Nice?
- Yeah. You were nice.

213
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:26,782
You were really nice.

214
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:31,151
I thought maybe you'd change a little,
and I would change a little.

215
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:35,215
We'd both get together,
and everything would be all right.

216
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:39,355
But you haven't changed.

217
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,333
And you're not even nice anymore.

218
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,532
What about you, Frannie?

219
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,665
You know, you used to
shave your legs all the time.

220
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,267
Now you don't shave them for weeks.

221
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:58,214
You were very appetizing.
But now...

222
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:03,254
[Scoffs] What do you mean, "now"?
What about yourself?

223
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,051
You used
to have a pretty good build, you know?

224
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:09,594
You did. Now you're starting
to look like... an egg.

225
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,687
- Egg?
- Yes, an egg.

226
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,097
Hey, if I was putting on a few pounds,
you could have said somethin'.

227
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,999
Why didn't you say somethin'?

228
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,868
Because, frankly, you never listen
to anything I say anyway.

229
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,101
That's because
you've got nothin' to say.

230
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,302
Oh, yes, I have something to say.
I have lots to say.

231
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,607
I have lots to say.
I've got plenty to say.

232
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,547
That's great. You're really
saying something now. Terrific.

233
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,777
- Where you goin'?
- For a little ride.

234
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,151
Oh, great. Run away.
That's what you're good at.

235
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:41,158
Terrifc. There she goes, folks.
Off again.

236
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,854
- You know what you're good at?
- No, and I can't wait to hear.

237
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:47,830
Being boring. You are so boring.
You have forgotten how to live.

238
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:51,869
I'm gonna get out of here
before I become just like you.

239
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,962
Good-bye, Miss Bora-Bora.

240
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,702
You know, Frannie,
you're full of shit.

241
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,176
You're always talking about paradise,
but when you get there,

242
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:03,442
it's still gonna be you and
all your shit walking along the beach.

243
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,484
Yeah? Not all my shit.
Because you'll still be here.

244
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,519
Big joke.

245
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,147
- You're damn right I won't be with you.
- This time it's over, Hank.

246
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,521
This time it is really over.

247
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:18,027
I'll tell you a little secret. I knew
it was over last New Year's Eve...

248
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,030
when I didn't want to
kiss you at midnight.

249
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,191
I wanted to kiss what's-her-name,
the tall blond.

250
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:25,862
- Yeah, I know the tall blond.
- [Cat Screeches]

251
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:29,202
I didn't want to kiss you either.
I wanted to kiss Moe.

252
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,208
- Moe?
- Yes, Moe. Your best friend, Moe.

253
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,768
He followed me into the bathroom.
He had my blouse half off. He had
his tongue down my throat.

254
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,780
- And I was enjoying it.
- You kissed Moe?

255
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,009
- Don't you come near me. Stay away.
Don't you touch me.
- You whore!

256
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:43,179
And don't you call me a whore,
you hypocritical son of a bitch.

257
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,654
You called that tall blond
the next day too, didn't you?

258
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:48,954
- And you slept with her. And I knew.
- [Growls]

259
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,791
That was nothin'.

260
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:56,129
Just a little somethin'.
Besides, I didn't want to hurt ya.

261
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:59,295
Well, you did.

262
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:02,601
- Come on, Frannie.
- [Ignition Whining]

263
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,905
- Come on back.
- [Engine Starting, Stalling]

264
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:09,276
- [Ignition Whining, Engine Starting]
- All right. If this is how you want it,

265
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,975
this is how you're gonna get it.

266
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:16,612
[Woman] Knock it off, huh? Leave
your private matters where they belong,

267
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,452
not out here in public.

268
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:23,790
Hey, Frannie, come on.
What are you doing?

269
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,989
Good-bye.

270
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,949
- Hello.
- [Woman] Hello.

271
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,109
- Hi, Angela. Moe here.
- Moe?

272
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:53,021
Yeah. Moe you, Moe me,
Moe life, Moe love.

273
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,356
Angela, is it true
that you're just after me for my body?

274
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:59,157
I've been wanting to
ask you that a long time.

275
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:04,292
- [Angela] Moe, I just thought
you were after me for my body.
- [Knocking]

276
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,963
- Yeah.
- [Angela] Wanna come over later?

277
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:11,736
Sure, my cosmically
beautiful cream puff.

278
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,942
- Did you ever kiss Frannie?
- What?

279
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:21,884
- [Angela Continues, Indistinct]
- Angela, I'd better call you back. Yeah.

280
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,217
- [Receiver Clanks]
- Did I ever what?

281
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:27,588
What happened with you and Frannie
last New Year's Eve?

282
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:32,586
New Year's Eve? Jesus.
I don't remember that.

283
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,132
She said you were kissing her
in the bathroom.

284
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,499
Oh, yeah. Well, I mean, uh...

285
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:42,700
No. Nothing happened. It was just
a New Year's kiss. You know.

286
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,708
- New Year's kiss?
- Yeah. I mean, it was New Year's Eve.

287
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,210
Everybody was kissing everybody.
You even tried to kiss me.

288
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:50,304
- She said you had her blouse off.
- She said that?

289
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:54,181
- Yeah.
- I don't remember nobody...

290
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,481
I don't remember her blouse being off.

291
00:20:56,588 --> 00:21:00,615
Did you unbutton her blouse,
or did she take it off?

292
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,626
- She didn't take her blouse off.
- She didn't?

293
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:07,597
- No, uh, I don't remember.
- You're my best friend.

294
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,668
If I can't trust you,
who am I gonna trust?

295
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:14,838
Look, nothing happened
on New Year's Eve, okay?

296
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,909
- Let's leave it at that.
- Yeah, I bet nothing happened.

297
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,501
Wait a minute.
What's wrong with you?

298
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:24,708
Nothing happened in the bathroom.
Everybody was drinking, having a good...

299
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:28,752
I don't believe you, you know that?
I think you're a snake.

300
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:30,788
Don't call me no snake, man.

301
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,858
If you want to start calling names,
what aboutJan Morehouse?

302
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,757
- Jan Morehouse?
- I never did bring that up to you.

303
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,092
- That was different.
- What was different about it?

304
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:41,665
- You didn't love her.
- Hey, don't tell me who I love.

305
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:46,101
She was just a good-time girl.
Besides, I didn't want to hurt ya.

306
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:49,662
Didn't want to hurt me?
So both of you hurt me in my bed...

307
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,141
while I'm out getting pizza
like an idiot?

308
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:54,371
Come on. "Don't want to hurt me."
Hey, forget it.

309
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,379
- You forget it.
- You forget it.

310
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,540
Comin' over here
with all that bullshit.

311
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:03,349
- That was three years ago, Moe.
- Yeah, but it was like yesterday to me.

312
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,485
It was six months ago
when I kissed Frannie too.

313
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:12,495
Kissed Frannie. That bitch.
I don't believe women.

314
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:15,395
She was comin' on with me,
for Christ's sake.

315
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,900
Really busted me.

316
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,470
- I'm sorry, Moe.
- I'm sorry too.

317
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:34,218
- What's the matter? You all right?
- I can't breathe, man.

318
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,310
I feel sick.

319
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:40,517
- Are you okay?
- Frannie and I busted up.

320
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:44,527
This time it's for good, Maggie.
I swear.

321
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:47,427
Come on, honey.
People make up; they break up.

322
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,432
Nobody's perfect.

323
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:53,903
- Listen. You still got your health.
- Yeah. Everything's gonna be okay.

324
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,974
Frannie, you don't
have to be strong for me.

325
00:22:57,075 --> 00:23:00,442
I'm your friend, dopey. You want
to fall apart? You want to cry?

326
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,070
Go ahead. Fall apart.
You'll feel better.

327
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:07,777
Maggie, I don't want to
fall apart, okay? [Sniffles]

328
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,753
Listen. Would you like me
to tell you the truth?

329
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,756
No, I don't want to
hear the truth either.

330
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:15,452
The truth is you're a very lucky lady.

331
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,393
Hank is absolutely a great guy.

332
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:21,261
Okay, so he's a little stingy.

333
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:24,164
- He's a stick-in-the-mud.
- You guys are gonna be fine.

334
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,635
Hank's wonderful.
