1
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:47,981
How many famous families are here
in this state?

2
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,487
We can count them on our fingers

3
00:02:51,195 --> 00:02:53,493
As far as our Thirunelveli district
is concerned

4
00:02:54,532 --> 00:02:58,832
My grandfather Chellappanadar was
the 1st man who bought a car

5
00:02:59,037 --> 00:03:00,004
Look at that

6
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:07,340
When grandfather used to come in a car
all villagers were wonder struck

7
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:10,176
My wife expired at an early age

8
00:03:13,217 --> 00:03:15,185
It is very difficult to
bring up a child without mother

9
00:03:15,553 --> 00:03:17,350
That is why, I left her
in a hostel

10
00:03:17,722 --> 00:03:21,351
Fortunately the incharge of the hostel
was my manager's sister

11
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,518
I felt miserable after leaving
my little girl in a hostel

12
00:03:26,731 --> 00:03:28,699
What could I do without
her mother?

13
00:03:31,736 --> 00:03:34,204
That Lady took special care
of Priya

14
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,536
Priya too adjusted herself
very well

15
00:03:36,908 --> 00:03:38,705
You look at her, She is playing
Piano at that little age

16
00:03:39,077 --> 00:03:40,704
She is very intelligent

17
00:03:42,747 --> 00:03:45,716
After that, my life almost
became like a factory

18
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,217
The factory started by
my father

19
00:03:47,752 --> 00:03:50,380
But I developed it by laying
a 2nd plan

20
00:03:50,755 --> 00:03:52,552
At that time G.H. Patel was
the Governor

21
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:56,060
I invited him for the inauguration
He accepted it happily

22
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,727
Who is that man
like a Joker?

23
00:04:00,932 --> 00:04:02,900
He is like a joker
He is a Joker

24
00:04:03,601 --> 00:04:07,901
He was my manager
Completely deaf

25
00:04:08,606 --> 00:04:10,073
Neither he could hear
nor he had brains

26
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:12,736
I got fed up & dismissed him

27
00:04:12,944 --> 00:04:17,244
Look at his Luck! He started a
factory opposite & got settled

28
00:04:17,782 --> 00:04:21,081
It's said that he started that factory
with the money swindled from me

29
00:04:21,786 --> 00:04:23,253
But I really didn't bother

30
00:04:26,624 --> 00:04:29,923
That's his son Thomas, some what
intelligent, unlike his father

31
00:04:30,628 --> 00:04:33,927
To show off he sent Thomas
to America for higher studies

32
00:04:34,465 --> 00:04:35,762
He is still in States

33
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:39,436
See his mentality
He is very selfish

34
00:04:39,804 --> 00:04:43,262
He is giving sweets only to
his son, lt's intolerable

35
00:04:46,477 --> 00:04:49,275
This was when we had laid
a new plan in our factory

36
00:04:49,647 --> 00:04:53,276
We organised a big feast
for all the workers

37
00:04:54,485 --> 00:04:56,112
Priya is distributing
sweets to every body

38
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,617
Puppy give me chocolate-No

39
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:09,462
Do you want chocolate?

40
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:11,961
Baby give him chocolate-No

41
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:16,306
Come on share the chocolate

42
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:20,136
In future, I'll never eat
chocolates

43
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:23,476
She told this in her
childhood out of anger

44
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:25,308
And she's still keeping
up her word

45
00:05:27,685 --> 00:05:30,984
She was extremely good at
her studies, had Gift of the Gab

46
00:05:33,691 --> 00:05:34,157
She sang as per her
will & pleasure

47
00:05:37,195 --> 00:05:39,322
Her mother was quiet by nature

48
00:05:40,364 --> 00:05:42,662
But they had one thing in common

49
00:05:44,368 --> 00:05:45,335
Both of them had a liking
for flowers

50
00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:08,682
<i>My desire is to hear the noise of</i>
<i>blooming flowers</i>

51
00:06:11,562 --> 00:06:20,698
<i>My desire is to hear the</i>
<i>noise of flower buds</i>

52
00:07:06,784 --> 00:07:11,084
<i>The voice of birds</i>
<i>The noise of worms</i>

53
00:07:11,455 --> 00:07:15,084
<i>Will teach us music my dear</i>

54
00:07:16,294 --> 00:07:20,754
<i>Wearing trinkets in the feet</i>
<i>Playing lute on the shore</i>

55
00:07:21,132 --> 00:07:24,761
<i>You hear the song sung</i>
<i>by river my dear</i>

56
00:07:25,803 --> 00:07:30,103
<i>The earth is a lute</i>
<i>the wind plays it</i>

57
00:07:30,641 --> 00:07:32,108
<i>We are hearing the sound of Rhythms</i>

58
00:08:28,866 --> 00:08:32,666
<i>When eyes are about to sleep</i>
<i>when the atmosphere is silent</i>

59
00:08:33,204 --> 00:08:35,832
<i>The sound of time piece is music</i>

60
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:42,505
<i>The place which can't see the sound</i>
<i>mingling with Rhythms</i>

61
00:08:42,713 --> 00:08:45,341
<i>The train making sound is music</i>

62
00:08:47,718 --> 00:08:52,018
<i>At the time of hunger the sound</i>
<i>of cooking food</i>

63
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:05,528
<i>Is happy music</i>

64
00:09:06,904 --> 00:09:11,364
<i>Mothers who are feeding milk to</i>
<i>babies through their breasts</i>

65
00:09:11,742 --> 00:09:14,210
<i>That sound is also music</i>

66
00:10:19,143 --> 00:10:23,273
<i>Little sparrows after taking bath</i>

67
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:26,275
<i>Fluttering their wings to dry</i>
<i>that sound is also music</i>

68
00:10:28,652 --> 00:10:32,611
<i>The sound of sea waves hitting</i>
<i>on black rocks</i>

69
00:10:33,157 --> 00:10:35,955
<i>Is also music</i>

70
00:10:37,995 --> 00:10:42,455
<i>The sound of Breeze</i>
<i>rubbing the wind</i>

71
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,479
<i>Is the music of love</i>

72
00:10:57,348 --> 00:11:01,808
<i>The sound of frogs Jumping</i>
<i>step by step over water</i>

73
00:11:02,186 --> 00:11:04,654
<i>Is also a music</i>

74
00:12:47,691 --> 00:12:52,151
Taking a Doctorate from
Harvard University of America

75
00:12:52,796 --> 00:12:58,598
The young Lion Thomas Thangadurai is

76
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:04,100

77

You will come to know
about it son

80
00:13:23,661 --> 00:13:27,290
Those who had gone to London in
the ship for their studies

81
00:13:27,498 --> 00:13:28,965
They are still boasting
about it

82
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:32,795
You went in a plane to America
for your studies-ls it a joke?

83
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,638
That man must see all this

84
00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:38,141
Where is the Garland?
Didn't you take money?

85
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:40,636
When wealth comes suddenly
They'll behave like this

86
00:13:40,844 --> 00:13:42,641
Correct Sir, They'll use
umberlla in moonlight

87
00:13:44,348 --> 00:13:46,976
Young Lion Thomas Thangadurai

Hey! Clear the way
Hey! Call your master

92
00:14:08,105 --> 00:14:09,697
Thangadurai what's this?

93
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,838
Is this an Industrial Estate or
a Drama company, for staging a show?

94
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:16,008
My son has come from America
That's why labourers...

95
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:17,009
What is the use?

96
00:14:17,214 --> 00:14:19,011
These crackers, loud speakers...

97
00:14:19,383 --> 00:14:22,682
It's nothing great going to States
one must've taste, taste

98
00:14:41,905 --> 00:14:43,031
What is he saying?

99
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,199
He is saying, this is corporation
road, don't act smart

100
00:14:47,411 --> 00:14:50,744
He is attacking him nicely
He is tearing him into pieces

101
00:14:50,948 --> 00:14:54,816
I am hearing well,
hearing well give it to him

102
00:15:09,466 --> 00:15:09,989

Young Lion Thomas Thangadurai

105
00:15:18,108 --> 00:15:20,235
You have torn him into pieces
my son I am very happy

106
00:15:20,611 --> 00:15:24,240
Yes, you know why I had sent you
to america?

107
00:15:25,115 --> 00:15:27,083
To study business management
- Not for that

108
00:15:27,284 --> 00:15:30,742
Just now you spoke English
so fluently for that only

109
00:15:31,455 --> 00:15:35,892
Now you had over taken my Boss that's
enough for me & I am very happy

110
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:39,989
He is an elderly person but he
doesn't know to behave like one-That's it

111
00:15:40,464 --> 00:15:42,125
Old man lacks brains

112
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:48,201
He is arrogant say that I'll be
very happy, very happy

113
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,139
Any how everything has gone well

114
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,466
Okay shall we go?

115
00:15:53,143 --> 00:15:55,270
No father this's the 1st time
I've come to the office-Today

116
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:57,106
I can start the work
- How is it possible?

117
00:15:57,481 --> 00:15:59,278
You forgot everything in 10 years?

118
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,778
In our house while starting
a new business

119
00:16:02,986 --> 00:16:06,945
We have to take blessings from
your Aunt you forgot Isn't it?

120
00:16:08,492 --> 00:16:10,119
Hey! Why are you pouring water?

121
00:16:10,494 --> 00:16:13,622
Can't she pray instead
of troubling us?

122
00:16:13,831 --> 00:16:16,459
I think she wants to
maintain cleanliness?

123
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:18,802
Hey go! I'll teach you
a lesson

124
00:16:19,336 --> 00:16:21,304
Their happiness is to make
us suffer

125
00:16:21,505 --> 00:16:23,632
If others enjoy, they'll
get tensed up

126
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:28,137
Okay! Is there no retirement
for them?

127
00:16:29,012 --> 00:16:30,980
You didn't understand
Mother Superior?

128
00:16:31,348 --> 00:16:32,815
Is it wrong to
be ordered to clean?

129
00:16:33,684 --> 00:16:34,981
Welcome Angel

130
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:38,810
You stay here permanently
& clean everything

131
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:40,816
We need Sunday

132
00:16:41,358 --> 00:16:42,985
Boy friend for her...

133
00:16:43,861 --> 00:16:44,828
And movie for her

134
00:16:45,062 --> 00:16:45,528
What's there in Movies?

135
00:16:48,031 --> 00:16:48,656
Only that much Isn't it?

136
00:16:48,866 --> 00:16:51,994
Hugging the hero &...

137
00:16:53,203 --> 00:16:54,830
The only male in the campus

138
00:16:55,038 --> 00:16:55,333
Who?

139
00:16:55,539 --> 00:16:56,164
Old watchman

140
00:16:56,373 --> 00:16:57,670
Go & kiss him

141
00:17:02,212 --> 00:17:04,009
It fell from Mother Superior's Office

142
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:07,346
I had doubt for a long time

143
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:09,348
Did you see her lips?
- I knew at that time itself

144
00:17:11,054 --> 00:17:12,351
Hey! Don't whistle

145
00:17:12,723 --> 00:17:14,020
I didn't whistle

146
00:17:14,391 --> 00:17:16,518
The noise is coming from
Mother Superior's Offce

147
00:17:18,896 --> 00:17:22,696
No Priya... Go

148
00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:46,722
It's wrong to smoke in
Mother Superior's Cabin

149
00:17:46,924 --> 00:17:47,891
It's wrong to peep also

150
00:17:48,258 --> 00:17:50,055
I'll report to Mother Superior

151
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,056
Even I'll report

152
00:17:51,261 --> 00:17:52,558
What will you report?

153
00:17:53,096 --> 00:17:53,892
You're trying to attract me

154
00:17:54,264 --> 00:17:56,562
You climbed up to Mother Superior's
Office to see a man

155
00:17:57,267 --> 00:17:59,064
She won't believe this I am her
favourite student

156
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:01,237
She's my favourite Aunty

157
00:18:01,438 --> 00:18:02,234
Aunty?

158
00:18:03,273 --> 00:18:04,069
It's me

159
00:18:08,111 --> 00:18:08,907
Who's that?

160
00:18:12,449 --> 00:18:13,074
Aunty

161
00:18:14,117 --> 00:18:15,084
Hey! Leave me

162
00:18:18,288 --> 00:18:18,754
What's this
- What?

163
00:18:20,123 --> 00:18:20,919
Cigeratte Smell

164
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,252
Have you learnt only this
from America?

165
00:18:23,627 --> 00:18:24,423
No, definitely no

166
00:18:24,628 --> 00:18:26,926
In America only studies
studies... studies...

167
00:18:28,298 --> 00:18:29,424
I know everything

168
00:18:31,301 --> 00:18:35,101
Are you going to prove your American
ideas in your father's Business?

169
00:18:35,472 --> 00:18:37,770
Yes, That's why, I came to you
Before joining the Business

170
00:18:37,975 --> 00:18:39,101
To get your blessings

171
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:40,276
And then to roam around here

172
00:18:40,644 --> 00:18:42,271
My blessings will be there
always for you

173
00:18:42,646 --> 00:18:44,273
But you can't roam here

174
00:18:44,481 --> 00:18:46,278
Oh God! I'll simply roam here...
like this...

175
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,617
This is a girls convent

176
00:18:49,152 --> 00:18:51,780
You shouldn't go beyond
the visitors room

177
00:18:52,155 --> 00:18:54,953
Okay, I'll roam in this
room itself

178
00:19:01,164 --> 00:19:01,630
What?

179
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:03,296
I want to meet girls

180
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,296
Visting hours are over

181
00:19:04,835 --> 00:19:05,802
No, lt's impossible

182
00:19:06,003 --> 00:19:06,970
No, this's a very urgent matter

183
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,467
If it's urgent, go & meet
Mother Superior

184
00:19:08,672 --> 00:19:09,798
Oh God, no need of
Mother Superior

185
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:10,473
I want to meet only girls

186
00:19:10,674 --> 00:19:11,971
Meet them tomorrow
Time is up Please go

187
00:19:12,175 --> 00:19:15,303
No, I came here for that only

188
00:19:56,053 --> 00:19:57,350
Hey! How did he look like?

189
00:19:57,888 --> 00:19:59,685
He was very handsome and
had moustache

190
00:20:00,223 --> 00:20:02,691
First you say! Lncarnation of Lord

191
00:20:17,407 --> 00:20:19,705
At a glance we can understand that
he belongs to Mother Superior's family

192
00:20:20,077 --> 00:20:23,535
Both of them are mad
Very fair like marble

193
00:20:23,747 --> 00:20:24,543
Have you seen him?

194
00:20:24,748 --> 00:20:28,707
A little-I saw him clearly
How is he? -Very strong body

195
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,388
Don't lie, How could you see him?

196
00:20:32,756 --> 00:20:37,716
Hey! Which hand did he catch?
This hand?

197
00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:40,726
You all are crazy about men

198
00:20:59,282 --> 00:21:00,078
Why are you screaming?

199
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:03,578
She slipped & fell down
- yes because of soap...

200
00:21:03,787 --> 00:21:05,254
Were you quarrelling?
- Not at all

201
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:07,916
This is a bathroom not a play ground
Go soon after taking bath

202
00:21:21,972 --> 00:21:22,597
Have they gone?

203
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,109
May I go to mother superior
& report now? -No

204
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:27,776
Look at his eyes, a suspicious look

205
00:21:29,312 --> 00:21:32,440
His cheeks are turning reddish
He is feeling shy

206
00:21:32,649 --> 00:21:34,276
He is innocent, Leave him

207
00:21:36,486 --> 00:21:41,116
Mother superior is his favourite Aunt
That's why he is very proud

208
00:21:42,325 --> 00:21:44,953
If we give him width
he will ride on us

209
00:21:45,662 --> 00:21:48,130
That's his character since childhood
- How do you know about him?

210
00:21:48,832 --> 00:21:50,459
I know it-No not like that

211
00:21:51,501 --> 00:21:55,460
Earlier you caught my hand, Now you've
come to the ladies bathroom

212
00:21:56,173 --> 00:21:57,140
What do you want?

213
00:21:58,008 --> 00:22:00,476
I need a help from you
- What's it?

214
00:22:07,517 --> 00:22:11,476
Mother Superior's Office is very
beautiful where should I put this?

215
00:22:12,189 --> 00:22:13,486
You put there-No you put it here

216
00:22:14,524 --> 00:22:15,491
You put it here, here

217
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,988
Don't tell lie, That day you
changed the place isn't it?

218
00:23:45,949 --> 00:23:49,248
Catching hand, getting into
ladies bath room

219
00:23:49,953 --> 00:23:52,581
According to that I thought
you are a scoundrel

220
00:23:56,459 --> 00:23:58,927
What you did today was
heart warming

221
00:24:10,473 --> 00:24:13,670
What's your name?

222
00:24:14,644 --> 00:24:15,611
Don't you know?

223
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:21,617
No, What is your name?

224
00:24:22,986 --> 00:24:23,611
Name?

225
00:24:33,663 --> 00:24:41,627
When the rain of sympathy drenched
the world-the divine figure appeared

226
00:24:42,672 --> 00:24:49,635
His body glittered like diamond
even lying on the straw

227
00:25:17,374 --> 00:25:23,335
This is not good
This is a prayer to God

228
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:26,845
Something is missing Isn't it?

229
00:25:28,385 --> 00:25:31,013
We've to practice more

230
00:25:32,055 --> 00:25:34,023
Every thing must be perfect
in Bishop's presence

231
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:37,686
You practice it again & again

232
00:25:43,733 --> 00:25:44,700
Notes are correct, lsn't it?

233
00:25:46,736 --> 00:25:51,036
Notes are correct, I think mother
didn't say about notes

234
00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:54,377
Mother expects some
more feeling

235
00:25:55,245 --> 00:26:00,205
How is it possible to rememeber the
notes & lyrics at the same time?

236
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,378
My body shivers in the presence
of Mother Superior

237
00:26:06,923 --> 00:26:12,725
For whom are we singing? Neither for
mother superior nor for the audience

238
00:26:14,097 --> 00:26:15,064
We've to sing for Him

239
00:26:18,101 --> 00:26:20,865
We have to sing only
for the Almighty

240
00:26:23,006 --> 00:26:30,970
<i>When the rain of sympathy drenched</i>
<i>the world the divine figure appeared</i>

241
00:26:36,619 --> 00:26:45,084
<i>He glittered like diamond</i>
<i>lying on the straw</i>

242
00:26:50,133 --> 00:26:58,097
<i>Sun can't appear in front of</i>
<i>stars, but God appears at anytime</i>

243
00:26:59,142 --> 00:27:07,106
<i>To wipe off the tears with his blood</i>
<i>child Christ appeared</i>

244
00:27:16,993 --> 00:27:27,801
<i>Son of God appeared to bloom flowers</i>
<i>on the earth which is ruined by war</i>

245
00:27:44,187 --> 00:27:52,652
<i>He bloomed like a flower</i>
<i>on the rocks of Calvary Hills</i>

246
00:27:53,029 --> 00:28:00,834
<i>He appeared as light to eradicate</i>
<i>the darkness of centuries</i>

247
00:28:02,205 --> 00:28:10,670
<i>He appeared to change the</i>
<i>hard hearted into soft hearted</i>

248
00:28:11,381 --> 00:28:20,187
<i>He appeared to change the</i>
<i>desert into an Oasis</i>

249
00:29:22,452 --> 00:29:28,413
Being a motherless child, Amalraj
entrusted her to me

250
00:29:29,459 --> 00:29:30,426
That's Priya

251
00:29:33,796 --> 00:29:36,924
Nobody can teach devotion
& faith

252
00:29:37,967 --> 00:29:38,763
That's an inborn quality

253
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:43,598
You tell Priya to sing the
main voice

254
00:30:01,391 --> 00:30:07,352
If I knew that she'll turnup so beautiful
I would've cajoled her then itself

255
00:30:12,335 --> 00:30:13,632
I wasted my time in
childhood itself

256
00:30:18,508 --> 00:30:19,133
You can't meet girls

257
00:30:19,342 --> 00:30:20,969
Please, I want to see Puppy

258
00:30:21,177 --> 00:30:22,303
Puppy-I don't know

259
00:30:23,012 --> 00:30:25,640
Priya? Singing Priya?
I don't know

260
00:30:32,855 --> 00:30:34,322
She'll always be in the
music class

261
00:30:55,712 --> 00:30:57,839
No, Don't stop it

262
00:31:02,385 --> 00:31:04,012
I am going back today

263
00:31:06,389 --> 00:31:08,357
Flower

264
00:31:18,067 --> 00:31:21,696
Priya we had played so much
in our childhood

265
00:31:22,905 --> 00:31:23,701
We had quarrels also

266
00:31:24,907 --> 00:31:26,534
But now while I am seeing you...

267
00:31:28,411 --> 00:31:30,709
I am hestitating to meet you
face to face

268
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,377
I don't know how to say

269
00:31:42,425 --> 00:31:44,723
I know one lady will
come in my life

270
00:31:47,096 --> 00:31:50,395
That would be you
I've decided it today

271
00:31:53,102 --> 00:31:55,070
Now only I am realising
why I came here

272
00:31:55,438 --> 00:31:56,905
Realised, realised

273
00:31:58,441 --> 00:31:59,908
Realised? -Yes realised

274
00:32:00,109 --> 00:32:01,736
Priya-Yes I am Priya

275
00:32:02,445 --> 00:32:05,243
No-Have you come to my college
to attract my students?

276
00:32:07,784 --> 00:32:08,910
You don't wait a minute more here

277
00:32:09,619 --> 00:32:10,916
Aunty sorry... I am...
- get out

278
00:32:35,144 --> 00:32:35,940
This is very beautiful

279
00:33:17,854 --> 00:33:22,154
Old man is well trapped, You don't
back of the car let him go back

280
00:33:22,525 --> 00:33:25,824
You sit here, I'll see
- where are you going...

281
00:33:47,884 --> 00:33:49,181
Elderly man, I have to
give him respect

282
00:33:49,385 --> 00:33:55,517
Yes old man, big man, How's it within
a week Public road became his own road?

283
00:33:56,058 --> 00:33:58,185
Elderly man, Aged man...
- No, No, I haven't finished yet

284
00:33:58,561 --> 00:34:01,530
The same elderly stubborn man
now became uncle

285
00:34:02,064 --> 00:34:05,522
Elderly man... - simply chanting
elderly man, stop it, you listen to me

286
00:34:05,735 --> 00:34:10,695
Do you know what it means
L.O.V. E... P.R.I.Y. A...

287
00:34:10,973 --> 00:34:12,964
Father you don't say like that
Nothing doing

288
00:34:14,477 --> 00:34:19,505
Don't feel shy, my sister told me
everything on telephone

289
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:23,779
You started loving my
master's daughter?

290
00:34:24,253 --> 00:34:27,188
Father, once upon a time he was
your master not mine

291
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:30,583
Oh! Only now you're proving
that you're my son

292
00:34:30,793 --> 00:34:34,456
I am feeling very happy

293
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:38,424
Exactly your personality and
her personality is perfect

294
00:34:38,968 --> 00:34:41,459
They'll say something like
matching, lsn't it, like that

295
00:34:41,671 --> 00:34:42,660
Cajole her

296
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,071
We'll merge both the factories

297
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,705
Dad in between there's a road

298
00:34:47,109 --> 00:34:48,633
Son we'll construct a Bridge

299
00:34:48,844 --> 00:34:49,708
Where's the Mason?

300
00:34:49,912 --> 00:34:51,243
Hey! Where's the Engineer?

301
00:35:01,591 --> 00:35:02,580
Everyone stand in the
order, please

302
00:35:02,792 --> 00:35:03,850
Put your cap properly

303
00:35:05,761 --> 00:35:07,194
It's you, put your cap properly

304
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,425
Everyone face the camera
with a smiling face

305
00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:12,759
Everyone smile, please

306
00:35:12,969 --> 00:35:14,163
The Madam who's in the middle
please smile

307
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,200
Smile please

308
00:35:27,049 --> 00:35:28,209
Let this be with you
as our memory

309
00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:31,280
After leaving this convent

310
00:35:31,487 --> 00:35:33,955
I think my daughter will
suffer a lot

311
00:35:35,057 --> 00:35:39,551
Because, she'll miss your
love & affection

312
00:35:42,064 --> 00:35:43,861
I don't know how to thank you

313
00:35:44,367 --> 00:35:45,595
In this generation

314
00:35:45,801 --> 00:35:49,328
Talent, knowledge, obedience, culture

315
00:35:49,538 --> 00:35:52,871
It's very difficult to see all
these in one

316
00:35:56,879 --> 00:36:00,406
I'll ask you the same question which
I've asked every student

317
00:36:02,485 --> 00:36:04,578
Within 10 yrs, what'll you become?

318
00:36:05,855 --> 00:36:07,254
As a mother for
two children

319
00:36:08,257 --> 00:36:10,157
Are you going to
settle as a wife?

320
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:15,622
Do you want to become a great scientist
in the Nuclear Research Centre?

321
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:19,793
My family business is there
but she...

322
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:24,772
Priya should continue your family
business, isn't it?

323
00:36:26,709 --> 00:36:29,576
Will she be able to manage
family & business?

324
00:36:32,114 --> 00:36:36,016
There won't be any problem if you
get a groom from your field, lsn't it?

325
00:36:36,285 --> 00:36:37,411
He'll understand, isn't it?

326
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:40,088
I am not telling that she should
continue our family business

327
00:36:40,289 --> 00:36:42,018
Even Government job is Okay

328
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,685
Even she can become
an I.A. S Officer

329
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:48,293
No need, she has to meet the
politicians daily isn't it?

330
00:36:48,931 --> 00:36:50,364
If you want what about?
Doctor's course?

331
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,095
Let her study

332
00:36:52,468 --> 00:36:55,869
I'll build a hosptial for her
with all latest equipments

333
00:36:57,206 --> 00:36:58,366
Good Profit

334
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,235
And with that, if she gets married
to a Doctor

335
00:37:02,445 --> 00:37:05,039
They both can manage the
hospital as a team

336
00:37:05,247 --> 00:37:06,714
And they can even manage the family

337
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,981
That'll gain us a huge profit
than Rahim's factory

338
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,448
I want to become a Nun

339
00:37:21,797 --> 00:37:23,059
Are you mad?

340
00:37:23,332 --> 00:37:26,699
I thought you'll educate &
lead her in Right path

341
00:37:26,902 --> 00:37:29,234
Now, you're trying to
make her as a Nun

342
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,869
Please understand my feelings

343
00:37:34,677 --> 00:37:36,235
You've mistaken

344
00:37:37,313 --> 00:37:40,510
That only if we become a Nun
we can achieve sanctity

345
00:37:42,918 --> 00:37:44,545
Go & tell her, madam

346
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,479
She won't listen to me

347
00:37:49,825 --> 00:37:53,488
She wouldn't have taken
this decision in a day

348
00:37:54,697 --> 00:37:57,632
Priya, you were brought up
in the hostel

349
00:37:58,601 --> 00:38:01,297
From hostel to house and
house to hostel

350
00:38:02,805 --> 00:38:04,534
You shouldn't think that
only this is life

351
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,710
For my sake please think again

352
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:43,305
Hey, Reduce the volume please

353
00:38:44,313 --> 00:38:45,302
What to do, sir?

354
00:38:45,815 --> 00:38:47,146
I am cutting hair by
listening music

355
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,216
There's no respect for the
profession, itself

356
00:38:50,052 --> 00:38:52,077
Even the girls who visit here
are interested in that sir

357
00:38:52,521 --> 00:38:53,385
Okay close that door

358
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:56,519
Hey, close that door &
stop this music

359
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,486
Food is closed, smile is closed

360
00:39:00,029 --> 00:39:01,155
And everything is closed

361
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,560
Love failure for this Thomas

362
00:39:07,036 --> 00:39:09,800
If it was another girl, she would've
praised me for sacrificing

363
00:39:11,774 --> 00:39:12,900
Or is it wrong to love?

364
00:39:15,211 --> 00:39:16,109
You be in her position

365
00:39:17,112 --> 00:39:18,443
The decision she has taken
is great thing

366
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:21,607
How tensed she would've been?

367
00:39:24,553 --> 00:39:26,180
Between this, how can I
express my love?

368
00:39:26,622 --> 00:39:28,180
Then, are you not going to
express your love?

369
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:30,756
Hey, I should express

370
00:39:34,897 --> 00:39:35,659
Should express

371
00:39:38,067 --> 00:39:38,863
I'll express

372
00:39:54,283 --> 00:39:55,807
But I couldn't express it

373
00:40:04,994 --> 00:40:07,485
While talking, I'll hold her
like this and...

374
00:40:09,798 --> 00:40:10,423
Kiss her

375
00:40:11,433 --> 00:40:12,092
Then...

376
00:40:23,245 --> 00:40:24,735
Even if earth & sky merges

377
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:29,147
If sea & air get separated

378
00:40:30,953 --> 00:40:31,544
You & I...

379
00:40:36,959 --> 00:40:38,256
To tell it simply...

380
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,628
Is 5.30 mass over?

381
00:41:19,835 --> 00:41:20,631
This's the 5th time you're asking

382
00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:22,632
Even if you ask for 50 times
the time won't chage

383
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:29,004
I shouldn't blabber, due to tension

384
00:41:29,812 --> 00:41:31,245
I've to tell her as, I memorised

385
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:40,013
I've to tell little boldly

386
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,221
Look, I'm sweating

387
00:41:43,092 --> 00:41:43,922
Mass is over

388
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:51,825
Are you coming from the Church?

389
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:52,758
For Mass?

390
00:41:53,936 --> 00:41:54,561
Even I...

391
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:58,997
Hasn't your father come?

392
00:42:00,342 --> 00:42:03,505
He considers it as a sin for a
teenage girl to go to the Church

393
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,648
Then, how can he accompany me?

394
00:42:07,282 --> 00:42:09,648
No, he had left you in the hostel
in your childhood

395
00:42:10,352 --> 00:42:12,411
So, he may have some feeling that he
didn't take good care of you

396
00:42:14,256 --> 00:42:15,484
Look, I didn't go in
a wrong path

397
00:42:16,692 --> 00:42:17,681
Since my childhood

398
00:42:18,394 --> 00:42:20,988
I was having the feelings that
God is with me

399
00:42:22,398 --> 00:42:24,025
I was brought up with that hope

400
00:42:24,733 --> 00:42:27,702
But if you become a Nun
you'll have to suffer, lsn't it?

401
00:42:30,072 --> 00:42:32,199
I know, Thomas, I know

402
00:42:33,575 --> 00:42:37,375
I know, the life of a Nun is
not an easy task

403
00:42:38,247 --> 00:42:42,707
When everyone is jealous of
money & the position

404
00:42:43,752 --> 00:42:46,050
It's wrong to see that
I am sacrificing, lsn't it?

405
00:42:47,256 --> 00:42:48,052
Thomas, you tell me

406
00:42:48,757 --> 00:42:50,224
Is it wrong to become a Nun?

407
00:42:51,927 --> 00:42:52,222
No

408
00:42:54,763 --> 00:42:55,229
No

409
00:43:03,439 --> 00:43:04,736
Baby has prepared all the items

410
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:15,576
A very good cook

411
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:22,587
Priya is a very good cook

412
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:25,092
Don't you see the
changes in the house?

413
00:43:25,627 --> 00:43:26,924
It's all because of
Priya's touch

414
00:43:27,296 --> 00:43:28,923
He's Mr. Arokiadas

415
00:43:29,465 --> 00:43:31,262
Since generations, they're
doing yarn business

416
00:43:33,802 --> 00:43:35,929
He is his only brilliant son, David

417
00:43:36,472 --> 00:43:38,440
He has many new ideas

418
00:43:39,141 --> 00:43:43,271
Mr. Arokiadas should be very lucky
to beget him as his son

419
00:43:45,314 --> 00:43:49,774
In the Garden, I've put
Korean grass, shall we go?

420
00:44:00,662 --> 00:44:04,120
First, I was managing
the yarn factory

421
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:07,631
Father asked me to manage
yarn dying

422
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:09,637
That's why I came there

423
00:44:10,506 --> 00:44:14,135
Father said, we'll export
yarn in future

424
00:44:15,677 --> 00:44:16,644
Has anything fell down?

425
00:44:17,179 --> 00:44:17,474
What?

426
00:44:19,348 --> 00:44:20,315
Has anything fell down?

427
00:44:25,187 --> 00:44:27,985
You are very smart, more than
what I expected

428
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,988
Father only asked me to
wear this red tie

429
00:44:35,364 --> 00:44:38,822
I am feeling very shy

430
00:44:42,538 --> 00:44:45,507
In this alliance...

431
00:44:45,707 --> 00:44:46,674
Alliance?

432
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:49,677
Did father say this?

433
00:44:50,379 --> 00:44:50,845
Yes

434
00:44:55,717 --> 00:44:56,342
Shall I tell you
one thing?

435
00:44:57,553 --> 00:44:59,180
Your first interest is yarn

436
00:45:00,389 --> 00:45:02,186
Second Interest is yarn dyeing

437
00:45:03,392 --> 00:45:05,189
Third interest is yarn export

438
00:45:06,562 --> 00:45:08,530
My first interest is God

439
00:45:09,731 --> 00:45:11,699
My second interest is Prayer

440
00:45:12,734 --> 00:45:14,861
My third interest is Social Service

441
00:45:16,405 --> 00:45:19,374
You sacrifice your life
for yarn

442
00:45:20,576 --> 00:45:23,704
I'll sacrifice my
life to God

443
00:45:27,082 --> 00:45:27,548
Father

444
00:45:29,084 --> 00:45:31,712
So, you came directly
over here

445
00:45:32,254 --> 00:45:33,221
You didn't tell your father

446
00:45:34,089 --> 00:45:35,056
Mother, there's no other way

447
00:45:35,924 --> 00:45:37,892
Father very well, knows that
I want to become a Nun

448
00:45:38,927 --> 00:45:40,053
Then, why should he
search for a groom?

449
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:43,227
Tomorrow, lf you don't like
anything here

450
00:45:44,433 --> 00:45:45,900
Will you get angry & go to your
father's house?

451
00:45:48,103 --> 00:45:51,561
The life of a Nun is not an
easy task as you think?

452
00:45:54,443 --> 00:45:57,571
We've to obey without
asking any questions?

453
00:45:58,947 --> 00:46:00,915
We've to be a Spinster forever

454
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:04,919
We should live in simplicity
without having any property

455
00:46:05,454 --> 00:46:08,082
Mother, I am prepared to
sacrifice everything

456
00:46:08,624 --> 00:46:10,592
Do you know what
you're sacrificing?

457
00:46:12,127 --> 00:46:15,255
What do you know about the
outside world to say "No"?

458
00:46:17,633 --> 00:46:18,930
Priya, keep one thing in mind

459
00:46:20,802 --> 00:46:23,270
If the doors of this convent
closes for once

460
00:46:24,473 --> 00:46:25,440
It won't open again

461
00:46:26,642 --> 00:46:29,611
Your contract is neither with me
nor with this Church?

462
00:46:30,812 --> 00:46:31,608
It's with the God

463
00:46:33,982 --> 00:46:37,281
Go, & help your father

464
00:46:38,487 --> 00:46:40,284
Sing nicely, smile nicely

465
00:46:41,323 --> 00:46:43,120
Look at others the way they live

466
00:46:44,826 --> 00:46:47,954
After that, Even if you think
there's no meaning in that life

467
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:51,298
Within you

468
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:53,801
If you think there's
only God

469
00:46:55,003 --> 00:46:55,799
Come to me

470
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:02,635
Did you go alone?

471
00:47:02,844 --> 00:47:03,811
Even he came with me

472
00:47:06,181 --> 00:47:09,150
Don't keep on chatting
Go & attend the customer, Go!

473
00:47:15,857 --> 00:47:17,654
We shouldn't talk, sit
& stand

474
00:47:18,193 --> 00:47:20,661
Look at the conditions,
for this salary

475
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:25,667
It's hair cutting, isn't it?

476
00:47:26,034 --> 00:47:27,001
You've to cut for me
Isn't it?

477
00:47:28,203 --> 00:47:30,000
Oh! God! My hair!

478
00:47:30,706 --> 00:47:32,333
Sandhya has bungled it

479
00:47:32,541 --> 00:47:34,338
She has cut the hair of the
person who came for facial

480
00:47:50,726 --> 00:47:51,852
My husband doesn't like this

481
00:47:52,561 --> 00:47:54,028
Are you running
a Beauty Parlour?

482
00:47:54,563 --> 00:47:55,689
Will you cut whoever comes in?

483
00:47:56,732 --> 00:47:58,359
Do you know who
my husband is?

484
00:48:00,736 --> 00:48:02,203
I'll get everyone arrested

485
00:48:03,405 --> 00:48:04,030
From top, you look like Madhuri film star

486
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:04,864
And bottom, film star Sridevi

487
00:48:06,408 --> 00:48:07,033
Who are you?

488
00:48:07,242 --> 00:48:07,708
God

489
00:48:21,089 --> 00:48:23,216
Now, Commissioner is at
your custody

490
00:48:23,592 --> 00:48:25,059
You look 10 years younger

491
00:48:33,435 --> 00:48:33,901
Here, take this

492
00:48:43,278 --> 00:48:45,746
If you would'nt have come
I would've lost my job

493
00:48:57,292 --> 00:48:58,418
There's nothing to cut

494
00:48:58,627 --> 00:48:59,423
Okay, Then lengthen it

495
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:02,426
I want

496
00:49:07,469 --> 00:49:09,437
She's inserting it

497
00:49:09,638 --> 00:49:11,606
Oh God! I can't control it

498
00:49:12,307 --> 00:49:15,276
I'll cut hapazardly
she'll end up ugly

499
00:49:16,645 --> 00:49:17,771
Sorry Madam You're finished

500
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:19,336
Where's your Son?

501
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:20,333
Isn't he coming for lunch?

502
00:50:20,876 --> 00:50:22,503
I don't know what has
happened to him

503
00:50:23,378 --> 00:50:25,505
He's always saying that
he's not feeling hungry

504
00:50:25,881 --> 00:50:27,849
He's talking something
by looking at the wall

505
00:50:28,717 --> 00:50:30,844
You do something for him

506
00:50:31,052 --> 00:50:32,519
What? Pig

507
00:50:32,888 --> 00:50:35,356
Even son is looking very
handsome like father

508
00:50:35,557 --> 00:50:37,184
And If you say Pig etc,
If won't look nice

509
00:50:37,392 --> 00:50:38,859
You first switch on the machine

510
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:39,856
Are you asking that
am I a human being?

511
00:50:40,228 --> 00:50:43,527
After so many years, are you
asking that am I an animal or human?

512
00:50:43,899 --> 00:50:44,866
Is it Justice?

513
00:50:45,066 --> 00:50:46,033
First switch on the Machine

514
00:50:46,568 --> 00:50:48,035
He doesn't feel hungry

515
00:50:48,236 --> 00:50:50,033
If I ask you, to do something...

516
00:50:50,405 --> 00:50:51,030
That's all, lsn't it?

517
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:54,037
I am not totally deaf
but a little...

518
00:50:54,743 --> 00:50:55,539
Son didn't have
his Lunch

519
00:50:56,244 --> 00:50:57,871
I've to convince him
That's all, lsn't it?

520
00:51:02,584 --> 00:51:03,380

521
00:51:04,419 --> 00:51:04,885
Why?

522
00:51:05,754 --> 00:51:06,721
Father, My throat is paining

523
00:51:07,422 --> 00:51:10,550
If you don't eat, what'll
happen to your health?

524
00:51:10,926 --> 00:51:14,555
Son, You're the one who's
slim in our clan

525
00:51:14,763 --> 00:51:16,731
Your mother is very much
worried, have it

526
00:51:17,098 --> 00:51:17,894
I said no, lsn't it?

527
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,897
Son, Don't get tensed

528
00:51:20,602 --> 00:51:24,402
To reduce this anger there's
only one way, that's marriage

529
00:51:24,606 --> 00:51:25,903
If you get married, everything
will become alright

530
00:51:26,441 --> 00:51:27,408
Did you show him
the Photos?

531
00:51:28,276 --> 00:51:30,574
Nothing, there's an enquiry
from Kovilpatti

532
00:51:30,946 --> 00:51:32,072
Hey! Don't stare

533
00:51:32,447 --> 00:51:34,415
She's not a country brute
but an educated girl

534
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:35,909
Even she has gone
to London like you

535
00:51:36,117 --> 00:51:36,742
Hey, What's her Qualification?

536
00:51:37,953 --> 00:51:39,580
She has studied Textiles...

537
00:51:40,455 --> 00:51:44,755
If you both get married, you
both can speak in English

538
00:51:45,126 --> 00:51:46,593
She'll even be useful in
our business

539
00:51:47,295 --> 00:51:48,762
Father, this is not business
this is love

540
00:51:50,465 --> 00:51:51,090
What did he say?

541
00:51:53,635 --> 00:51:55,603
Yes, We don't know
about love

542
00:51:56,471 --> 00:52:00,271
Hey! Son, We'll feel happy
if you get married to Priya

543
00:52:00,475 --> 00:52:00,941
Isn't it so?

544
00:52:01,309 --> 00:52:01,934
But that should happen
Isn't it?

545
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:04,278
To change your aunty's mind, do
you know the difficulties?

546
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:05,446
Tell him

547
00:52:06,147 --> 00:52:09,947
At that time, do you know the
strength they had?

548
00:52:10,485 --> 00:52:14,285
Your father tried to convince
but nothing happened

549
00:52:15,323 --> 00:52:17,120
In this, you shouldn't suffer

550
00:52:17,492 --> 00:52:18,959
We can't bear that son

551
00:52:21,329 --> 00:52:24,457
Hey, I asked him for
Pista Ice-Cream

552
00:52:25,166 --> 00:52:26,133
But he gave me Vanilla

553
00:52:26,334 --> 00:52:29,462
Didn't I eat it?
That's about it

554
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:31,635
You marry another girl

555
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,966
In the Beginning
lt'll be difficult

556
00:52:33,341 --> 00:52:36,469
But after a child & a family
We can adjust everything

557
00:52:36,845 --> 00:52:38,642
Even life itself is an
adjustment

558
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,647
I don't want adjustment

559
00:52:43,184 --> 00:52:44,151
You don't understand
one thing

560
00:52:44,686 --> 00:52:45,812
This problem had arised
because of you

561
00:52:46,021 --> 00:52:46,316
What?

562
00:52:46,688 --> 00:52:47,985
This wouldn't have happened
had you not sent me to the convent

563
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:50,487
Oh God!

564
00:52:50,859 --> 00:52:52,486
Gentlemen, please listen

565
00:52:53,028 --> 00:52:55,997
I asked him to go to the
convent to get blessings

566
00:52:56,197 --> 00:52:57,494
Hey be quiet, Be quiet

567
00:52:58,033 --> 00:53:00,001
He got trapped in
Love & is blaming me

568
00:53:00,201 --> 00:53:01,168
Who's mistake is this?

569
00:53:01,369 --> 00:53:02,495
Sir, Please tell me
Is this my mistake?

570
00:53:02,704 --> 00:53:03,329
Father please sit

571
00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:04,664
Then what?

572
00:53:04,873 --> 00:53:05,999
Mother, how could you manage
him for so long...

573
00:53:06,207 --> 00:53:07,003
Hey Ice-cream is getting wasted

574
00:53:07,709 --> 00:53:08,676
Hey leave, I'll eat it

575
00:53:10,712 --> 00:53:13,510
Switch it off, Please

576
00:53:15,383 --> 00:53:16,509
Please, some one switch it off

577
00:53:17,886 --> 00:53:18,682
Hey, lt's Sunday

578
00:53:19,888 --> 00:53:21,856
Hey, lazy fellows

579
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:24,858
Are you sleeping instead
of mixing dough?

580
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:26,857
Do you consider this as a
charitable trust, Get up

581
00:53:29,731 --> 00:53:30,026
Oh God!

582
00:53:30,231 --> 00:53:30,856
Get up

583
00:53:31,399 --> 00:53:32,525
Hey, Today its Pramodh's
marriage

584
00:53:32,734 --> 00:53:33,359
We've to go for the programme

585
00:53:33,568 --> 00:53:34,535
Everyone are sleeping by
forgetting that

586
00:53:34,736 --> 00:53:37,204
Programme? In this stage
Programme?

587
00:53:37,405 --> 00:53:40,704
You go jump over the streets
& come, I'll serve you

588
00:53:43,578 --> 00:53:46,376
Hey Guru, I don't like
all these guys

589
00:53:46,748 --> 00:53:47,715
First, chase them out

590
00:53:48,083 --> 00:53:50,551
Uncle, I don't know whether they're
singing the wake up Hymn at Tirupathi

591
00:53:50,752 --> 00:53:51,719
You're singing daily for us

592
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,717
Yes, you all are God of Tirupathi
isn't it?

593
00:53:54,089 --> 00:53:55,716
I'll tell you onething
very meaningfully

594
00:53:56,091 --> 00:53:57,388
God of Tirupathi will get Sweets

595
00:53:57,592 --> 00:53:58,889
And we get Scoldings

596
00:53:59,094 --> 00:54:01,562
Gurumuttu have you all kept
this room tidy?

597
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:03,727
Vegetable Market will be
better than this

598
00:54:04,099 --> 00:54:05,225
What's this, Lines drawn?

599
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,966
Oh God! Please don't
touch this

600
00:54:08,169 --> 00:54:08,567
Why?

601
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:10,738
Guru has written Music
which he has composed

602
00:54:11,106 --> 00:54:12,073
Is this Music?

603
00:54:12,941 --> 00:54:13,566
No need

604
00:54:14,943 --> 00:54:16,843
What's this? He's not allowing
me to see

605
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:18,239
No need

606
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,744
Is he begging or Pampering me?
He's saying "No"

607
00:54:20,949 --> 00:54:22,712
Uncle, that's not an
ordinary paper

608
00:54:23,184 --> 00:54:24,947
In future, they're going to
place that in the Museum

609
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:27,087
Hereafter from streets
to streets

610
00:54:27,288 --> 00:54:27,811
And from State to State

611
00:54:28,022 --> 00:54:29,080
They're only going to
sing my song

612
00:54:29,491 --> 00:54:31,425
Keep that paper safely, I'll
go and have a bath

613
00:54:31,626 --> 00:54:31,955
Don't touch it

614
00:54:33,361 --> 00:54:35,090
Only this work, I didn't
do for these stupids

615
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:37,087
I'll keep this also safely

616
00:54:40,502 --> 00:54:41,434
Hey, move

617
00:54:41,636 --> 00:54:42,227
Have your bath soon?

618
00:54:42,437 --> 00:54:43,529
Will it look good if we go late
for Promodh's marriage?

619
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:45,205
It is a problem for 4 people
to share 1 shower

620
00:54:46,708 --> 00:54:49,040
Ask your uncle to put 4
showers for 4 of us

621
00:54:49,544 --> 00:54:52,604
Yes, we're staying with others cost
without paying rent

622
00:54:52,714 --> 00:54:53,840
For that, one shower
for each

623
00:54:54,549 --> 00:54:56,949
If there's a little leverage you'll
ask for girls to wipe your hairs

624
00:54:57,719 --> 00:54:59,846
We got this chance, because
Promodh is our friend

625
00:55:00,321 --> 00:55:02,118
Even the bride doesn't
like us at all

626
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:05,555
If we do it hapazarosuly
she'll bite us, that's all

627
00:55:06,494 --> 00:55:07,893
Have, you arranged for that
Blue Guitar?

628
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:08,755
Hey! Lt has already gone

629
00:55:08,963 --> 00:55:10,430
Then, I'll get a
broken guitar

630
00:55:10,632 --> 00:55:11,326
I can't play with that

631
00:55:11,533 --> 00:55:14,024
Oh! Yes, he's great singer Michael Jackson
he'll play only with that

632
00:55:14,235 --> 00:55:15,463
Play with what you get

633
00:55:18,406 --> 00:55:19,464
Hey! Get ready soon

634
00:55:33,188 --> 00:55:33,745
Here...

635
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:35,149
Yes, there... there only

636
00:55:35,356 --> 00:55:37,381
I should buy a dress like
this if I get money

637
00:55:38,359 --> 00:55:39,155
What's this?

638
00:55:40,361 --> 00:55:41,453
That girl is in tension

639
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:42,819
Hey, groom

640
00:55:43,031 --> 00:55:43,497
Where are you going?

641
00:55:43,698 --> 00:55:44,323
Sandhya, ran away

642
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:45,497
She said, she doesn't want
this marriage

643
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:47,600
Oh! God! Atleast for the Programme sake
Please conduct this marriage

644
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:49,167
Wait, what did you do?

645
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:50,166
I didn't do anything

646
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:51,166
Then, why is she running?

647
00:55:51,372 --> 00:55:52,464
Welcome

648
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:56,704
Sandhya's best friend Geetha
Isn't it

649
00:55:56,911 --> 00:55:57,309
Yes

650
00:55:57,512 --> 00:55:58,604
There was a connection
between me and her

651
00:55:59,013 --> 00:55:59,843
Hey! Do you've brains?

652
00:56:01,082 --> 00:56:01,707
For whom?

653
00:56:01,916 --> 00:56:02,507
For him

654
00:56:02,717 --> 00:56:03,513
Hey, come here

655
00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:06,917
Hey, you're having connection with
bride's best friend

656
00:56:07,121 --> 00:56:08,349
That... you only have to
do something for this

657
00:56:08,556 --> 00:56:08,920
What can I do?

658
00:56:09,123 --> 00:56:10,181
You've done everything
Isn't it?

659
00:56:20,602 --> 00:56:21,534
Someone save her

660
00:56:25,573 --> 00:56:26,369
Please move

661
00:56:27,775 --> 00:56:29,606
According to the report
groom is a...

662
00:56:29,811 --> 00:56:32,041
He's having contact with the
bride's best friend

663
00:56:32,247 --> 00:56:32,679
Contact means?

664
00:56:32,881 --> 00:56:33,210
Fully?

665
00:56:33,414 --> 00:56:33,880
Yes sir

666
00:56:34,115 --> 00:56:35,275
She's going to jump exactly
at 10.30 A. M

667
00:56:35,483 --> 00:56:35,881
Why?

668
00:56:36,084 --> 00:56:36,812
Auspicious time, sir

669
00:56:39,053 --> 00:56:41,146
Those idiots are having set ups
at many places

670
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:42,550
And troubling us, Lastly

671
00:56:45,226 --> 00:56:48,992
I'll arrest that groom & get him
a severe punishment

672
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:50,060
Please come down

673
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:52,992
According to Law, committing suicide
is a great offence

674
00:56:53,268 --> 00:56:54,064
I'll even arrest you

675
00:56:54,269 --> 00:56:55,736
You can come & arrest
me there

676
00:57:00,842 --> 00:57:02,002
Hey, who's he?

677
00:57:03,578 --> 00:57:04,237
How's the view?

678
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:05,569
Is it Superb?

679
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:07,738
Hey, you shouldn't come
near me

680
00:57:07,949 --> 00:57:09,075
Don't try to come
I'll jump

681
00:57:09,951 --> 00:57:12,249
You jump, but a small advice

682
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,779
While you jump hold your
head downwards

683
00:57:15,323 --> 00:57:17,450
Then only, your head will hit
and that'll scatter

684
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,593
Yes, your brains will scatter and
you can reach heaven soon

685
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:24,530
What? Don't think, jump

686
00:57:25,466 --> 00:57:28,594
If your legs get fractured first, then
you'll become a hopeless case

687
00:57:28,836 --> 00:57:30,929
And forever everyone will address
you as lame sandhya

688
00:57:39,147 --> 00:57:41,945
I've a feeling, that atlast
you'll die

689
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:43,608
But your would be along
with geetha...

690
00:57:46,354 --> 00:57:46,877
Is it?

691
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:48,116
Is he a human being?

692
00:57:48,723 --> 00:57:51,089
He's the one who'll admire even the
stick which is covered with saree...

693
00:57:51,659 --> 00:57:52,387
How did you...

694
00:57:53,461 --> 00:57:54,291
This's okay!

695
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:57,026
Geetha is looking soft
like a Dunlop Bed

696
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,091
Wait, I'll come

697
00:58:04,005 --> 00:58:04,801
Please, Tell

698
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:06,705
Splinted eyes prema

699
00:58:07,175 --> 00:58:09,040
Prema? How he went to her?

700
00:58:09,344 --> 00:58:10,242
Even I can't understand that

701
00:58:10,979 --> 00:58:11,968
Actually, lf lights are
switched off

702
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:13,044
Even she can't find out
the difference

703
00:58:13,548 --> 00:58:15,015
But, that lean Asha

704
00:58:15,683 --> 00:58:17,344
I don't know how did he
get this mood

705
00:58:20,021 --> 00:58:20,919
Don't touch me!

706
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:21,486
No!

707
00:58:21,689 --> 00:58:24,658
Let me dress the flowers &
you can reach heaven decently

708
00:58:24,859 --> 00:58:27,327
lt'll be better if you go
after knowing the matter

709
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:28,853
He told me another
thing also

710
00:58:30,231 --> 00:58:31,323
You're like an angel

711
00:58:31,699 --> 00:58:33,166
You're very beautiful, worthy
of worshipping

712
00:58:33,601 --> 00:58:35,068
He told me you are a
divine girl

713
00:58:35,436 --> 00:58:36,460
Really, did he say?

714
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,194
Really!

715
00:58:37,505 --> 00:58:38,369
He's a Superb Person

716
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:40,105
He changed that girl's mind
by talking cleverly

717
00:58:40,875 --> 00:58:43,503
Then, without you, there's
no life

718
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:46,276
Something he said...

719
00:58:47,015 --> 00:58:48,505
Did he say that he
loves me!

720
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:51,180
Yes, he said but, why that's
needed now?

721
00:58:51,853 --> 00:58:53,115
Deva, don't leave me

722
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:53,844
No

723
00:58:54,055 --> 00:58:55,545
That's all, shall we do
one thing

724
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,855
We'll go & ask him
what was it?

725
00:58:58,059 --> 00:58:59,185
Come... Come...

726
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:11,130
Come, we'll marry

727
00:59:14,876 --> 00:59:15,968
He's a waiter at the
five star hotel

728
00:59:16,244 --> 00:59:17,336
He's not a waiter
but a Barber

729
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:20,010
He's not Barber but
a Hair Stylist

730
00:59:20,581 --> 00:59:20,876
He's my friend, Deva

731
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:22,543
What's his Qualification?

732
00:59:23,484 --> 00:59:24,644
He has studied the mind
of the girls

733
00:59:24,986 --> 00:59:25,714
He'll cajole the girl
whoever she may be

734
00:59:33,227 --> 00:59:34,057
You don't worry, Sir

735
00:59:34,996 --> 00:59:36,964
For friendship sake, Deva
will do anything

736
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:38,662
Sir, for me, friendship is
important

737
00:59:40,301 --> 00:59:42,565
Suppose I am going to start
a saloon tomorrow

738
00:59:43,404 --> 00:59:44,393
I am seeking help from
some one

739
00:59:44,605 --> 00:59:45,367
lf, I'll seek your help

740
00:59:45,573 --> 00:59:48,565
Won't you give me the old A/c
machine from your house?

741
00:59:51,412 --> 00:59:52,003
Won't you give?

742
00:59:54,949 --> 00:59:55,506
You'll give!

743
00:59:55,616 --> 00:59:56,207
You're a good person

744
00:59:56,851 --> 00:59:57,943
Sir, girls are of 3 types

745
00:59:58,786 --> 01:00:00,253
One type is they need
Love always

746
01:00:00,955 --> 01:00:02,582
Another type is they need
Love very rarely

747
01:00:03,791 --> 01:00:05,588
And third type is the one
who Love always

748
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:08,922
Sir, ln this which category
does your love belong to?

749
01:00:09,797 --> 01:00:11,594
She's not like that

750
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,291
A very sacred one

751
01:00:13,634 --> 01:00:14,760
Even my mother is
very sacred

752
01:00:15,136 --> 01:00:16,603
But the Pregancy matter... Sir

753
01:00:17,138 --> 01:00:17,934
Which occurs Unknowingly

754
01:00:18,973 --> 01:00:19,837
Not that, Deva

755
01:00:20,041 --> 01:00:20,268
Which?

756
01:00:20,641 --> 01:00:22,438
She's not interested in
those things

757
01:00:22,643 --> 01:00:24,440
Then, She may have interest with
someother person

758
01:00:25,146 --> 01:00:26,113
Can be like that

759
01:00:26,314 --> 01:00:27,110
Tell me his name

760
01:00:27,315 --> 01:00:28,111
I'll damage his weak point

761
01:00:28,316 --> 01:00:29,943
And throw him out & fill
you in that place

762
01:00:30,151 --> 01:00:30,947
That's the problem

763
01:00:31,152 --> 01:00:31,948
There are no weak points

764
01:00:32,153 --> 01:00:32,949
We'll create, Sir

765
01:00:33,154 --> 01:00:34,451
You tell me his name?

766
01:00:37,325 --> 01:00:37,950
God

767
01:00:39,327 --> 01:00:41,295
She wants to become a Nun

768
01:00:41,496 --> 01:00:42,463
As a Nun?

769
01:00:42,997 --> 01:00:44,487
Wearing black & black dress

770
01:00:49,003 --> 01:00:49,469
What?

771
01:00:50,505 --> 01:00:52,473
I don't want your friendship
& old A/c Machine

772
01:00:52,673 --> 01:00:54,300
Sir, can't change the
devotion

773
01:00:55,009 --> 01:00:55,976
You can change, Deva

774
01:00:57,845 --> 01:00:59,312
Sir, you're an educated person
& you know everything

775
01:00:59,514 --> 01:01:00,139
Who am I?

776
01:01:00,348 --> 01:01:01,144
I am a local Barber, sir

777
01:01:01,682 --> 01:01:04,651
I know only cutting, step cutting
& curling, sir

778
01:01:04,852 --> 01:01:06,479
I used to play a little
with girls

779
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:08,314
But, shouldn't play
with God, Sir

780
01:01:23,704 --> 01:01:25,672
Hey Go! Bullock cart

781
01:01:26,874 --> 01:01:29,001
You made me to go & meet her

782
01:01:30,044 --> 01:01:31,671
You provoked love in
my heart

783
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,508
Now, you created an interest in
her to become nun

784
01:01:36,884 --> 01:01:37,179
Why?

785
01:01:37,885 --> 01:01:39,011
Are you testing me?

786
01:01:40,221 --> 01:01:41,518
Or are you punishing me?

787
01:01:42,723 --> 01:01:44,350
I can't understand anything
that's why...

788
01:01:48,062 --> 01:01:49,029
What should I do now?

789
01:01:50,064 --> 01:01:51,190
Should I forget her?

790
01:01:52,733 --> 01:01:53,859
Or should I go & try
her for once

791
01:01:55,069 --> 01:01:55,694
Tell me

792
01:01:57,405 --> 01:02:00,033
If you can't say, atleast
show some gestures

793
01:02:20,595 --> 01:02:21,721
Oh God! It's you...

794
01:02:23,264 --> 01:02:25,232
Like an Onida devil you're
distrubing me always

795
01:02:25,433 --> 01:02:27,230
Sir, no need this, god will
curse us

796
01:02:27,435 --> 01:02:28,402
I asked God itself

797
01:02:28,603 --> 01:02:29,399
What did he say?

798
01:02:29,937 --> 01:02:32,405
I prayed to god to give me
strength to forget her?

799
01:02:33,608 --> 01:02:34,404
When I turned back

800
01:02:36,611 --> 01:02:38,579
God placed priya next
to me

801
01:02:38,779 --> 01:02:39,575
He has many requests, sir

802
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:40,747
God is in confusion

803
01:02:41,949 --> 01:02:43,075
I can't forget priya

804
01:02:43,451 --> 01:02:44,748
She's an angel, that's it
Isn't it

805
01:02:48,122 --> 01:02:50,420
Go somewhere and enjoy
happily for a week

806
01:02:51,125 --> 01:02:52,092
Then you can forget priya

807
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:53,585
I am not talking about that
this is love

808
01:02:58,633 --> 01:03:01,761
Sir, you're of the type of setting
with family & child

809
01:03:04,472 --> 01:03:05,939
Wipe it & give

810
01:03:06,474 --> 01:03:07,771
Sir, is a very decent
person

811
01:03:09,477 --> 01:03:11,274
Sir is very sweet like a
five star chocolate

812
01:03:14,315 --> 01:03:16,112
Is it good? Lt'll be
good sir!

813
01:03:18,819 --> 01:03:19,786
Sir, What I am trying
to tell is...

814
01:03:20,655 --> 01:03:22,782
One colourful snap of yours

815
01:03:23,491 --> 01:03:24,788
We'll advertise that snap
in all the papers

816
01:03:25,326 --> 01:03:27,294
We'll advertise it in all
the media, sir

817
01:03:27,995 --> 01:03:29,292
Wanting Brides

818
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:36,292
A beautiful intelligent
& rich

819
01:03:37,505 --> 01:03:39,473
Why won't you get a girl?

820
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:40,807
I don't want any other girl

821
01:03:41,175 --> 01:03:41,641
Then...

822
01:03:41,842 --> 01:03:42,467
I want only this girl

823
01:03:42,677 --> 01:03:43,803
You're pestering me, Sir

824
01:03:44,345 --> 01:03:45,972
What's there in that
girl?

825
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:48,808
Deva, lf you meet her, you
won't speak like this

826
01:03:50,184 --> 01:03:51,651
Have you seen the
lightening sparkling?

827
01:03:52,853 --> 01:03:53,820
Look at her smile

828
01:03:54,355 --> 01:03:56,823
Will I get shock, lf I
touch her?

829
01:03:57,858 --> 01:03:58,825
Don't touch

830
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:02,829
You'll get shock if you
just see her

831
01:04:04,699 --> 01:04:06,667
Deva, have you seen both suns
one after another

832
01:04:08,035 --> 01:04:08,831
I've seen

833
01:04:09,704 --> 01:04:10,830
Look at her eyes

834
01:04:11,372 --> 01:04:12,669
Then, you'll understand what I'm
trying to explain?

835
01:04:12,873 --> 01:04:13,999
Let the eyes be, sir

836
01:04:14,208 --> 01:04:18,167
Girls are not like a star, which
disappears when sun rises

837
01:04:28,723 --> 01:04:30,520
Throw the silver coins
& see

838
01:04:31,726 --> 01:04:33,353
You'll hear the noise
of her laugh

839
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,368
Hey guru, we've heard this tune
somewhere, lsn't it?

840
01:04:44,739 --> 01:04:46,366
Yes, very good line
Isn't it

841
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:50,877
This's my tune

842
01:04:51,579 --> 01:04:54,047
Has someone robbed it?
Who's it?

843
01:04:56,083 --> 01:04:57,209
Who's that singing my
tune?

844
01:04:57,418 --> 01:04:58,214
How did you know this?

845
01:04:59,253 --> 01:05:00,720
It was on the parcel paper

846
01:05:01,756 --> 01:05:02,723
Parcel?

847
01:05:03,424 --> 01:05:06,222
Sinners! I thought of becoming
a popular Mozart

848
01:05:06,427 --> 01:05:07,894
But they used this paper
as wraper

849
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:10,556
Have you composed it
on your own?

850
01:05:10,765 --> 01:05:12,232
Really, it's me

851
01:05:12,433 --> 01:05:13,559
Hey, someone please
tell her

852
01:05:15,102 --> 01:05:16,228
It's very beautiful

853
01:05:17,438 --> 01:05:18,405
Thank you very mcuh

854
01:05:18,773 --> 01:05:21,742
Recording company doesn't understand
as you understood

855
01:05:22,610 --> 01:05:24,237
Remove the sorrow from the
face of the moon

856
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:27,577
And replace it with smile

857
01:05:28,783 --> 01:05:30,080
lt'll look like my priya

858
01:05:38,125 --> 01:05:40,753
Hey, Look there, priya is there

859
01:05:46,133 --> 01:05:48,931
Sir, what lovely hair
she has got?

860
01:05:50,638 --> 01:05:52,435
If she becomes Nun, they'll
cut it, lsn't it?

861
01:05:53,641 --> 01:05:55,108
Yes! Go & do something

862
01:05:55,976 --> 01:05:56,772
I won't leave her

863
01:06:02,483 --> 01:06:03,279
Your name?

864
01:06:05,152 --> 01:06:05,948
Very good name

865
01:06:06,153 --> 01:06:08,621
You read the next composition
lt'll be very good

866
01:06:12,827 --> 01:06:13,623
Who's he?

867
01:06:13,828 --> 01:06:14,123
Who?

868
01:06:14,328 --> 01:06:15,625
He's looking at me itself

869
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:17,127
Who's that?

870
01:06:17,998 --> 01:06:19,124
He's staring at me

871
01:06:20,668 --> 01:06:23,296
By looking at the eyes of the girls
he'll say what's on their mind

872
01:06:24,839 --> 01:06:27,137
Then, what's on my mind?

873
01:06:31,178 --> 01:06:34,306
<i>Your eyes resembles</i>

874
01:06:34,849 --> 01:06:37,977
<i>You're an angel</i>

875
01:06:38,352 --> 01:06:41,480
<i>You're born with a silver spoon</i>

876
01:06:41,856 --> 01:06:44,984
<i>You're like an apple in the refrigerator</i>

877
01:06:45,192 --> 01:06:48,320
<i>You have your food in a golden Plate.</i>
<i>Benz AC car</i>

878
01:06:48,863 --> 01:06:52,492
<i>Even then, what's the burden in your</i>
<i>heart which you can't express?</i>

879
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:54,327
<i>Loneliness is</i>
<i>happiness to you</i>

880
01:06:54,535 --> 01:06:56,002
<i>And youth is</i>
<i>a torture</i>

881
01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:59,669
<i>What sorrow do you've which you're</i>
<i>not expressing through eyes?</i>

882
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:04,007
Hey! Why isn't there
any reaction?

883
01:07:39,413 --> 01:07:42,382
<i>How will she hide</i>
<i>her beauty?</i>

884
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:45,878
<i>How'll she unite her</i>
<i>dreams & wonders?</i>

885
01:07:46,086 --> 01:07:52,218
<i>You'll get mad and shall</i>
<i>I give you the treatment?</i>

886
01:08:07,942 --> 01:08:15,178
<i>I am not mad, I don't need</i>
<i>your treatment</i>

887
01:08:15,449 --> 01:08:18,907
<i>There is no one mad even</i>
<i>in my ancestors</i>

888
01:08:19,119 --> 01:08:22,418
<i>And there are no confusions</i>
<i>in my mind</i>

889
01:08:22,623 --> 01:08:26,081
<i>I didn't have a thought</i>
<i>of serving my husband</i>

890
01:08:26,293 --> 01:08:29,922
<i>But in social service, there</i>
<i>is no any harm in it</i>

891
01:08:30,130 --> 01:08:33,588
<i>I am not a burden for</i>
<i>anyone in this world</i>

892
01:08:33,801 --> 01:08:37,259
<i>There are no darkness</i>
<i>in my eyes</i>

893
01:08:37,471 --> 01:08:38,938
<i>Loving a person Yesterday</i>

894
01:08:39,306 --> 01:08:40,773
<i>Having a husband today</i>

895
01:08:41,141 --> 01:08:44,599
<i>I don't wish to suffer</i>
<i>in the kitchen</i>

896
01:08:44,812 --> 01:08:48,270
<i>First garlanding and then</i>
<i>handcuffing</i>

897
01:08:48,482 --> 01:08:51,940
<i>I don't wish to get</i>
<i>married</i>

898
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:54,116
<i>Oh God! She doesn't want</i>
<i>to marry</i>

899
01:08:54,321 --> 01:08:55,948
<i>Change the route</i>

900
01:09:10,838 --> 01:09:13,966
<i>Oh, What lovely eyes?</i>

901
01:09:18,345 --> 01:09:25,148
<i>Oh, What lovely golden</i>
<i>Lotus cheeks</i>

902
01:09:25,686 --> 01:09:28,985
<i>Oh, what lips?</i>

903
01:09:29,189 --> 01:09:32,647
<i>The colour of the</i>
<i>cherry fruit</i>

904
01:09:37,865 --> 01:09:39,332
<i>Only nose is of</i>
<i>over size</i>

905
01:09:41,035 --> 01:09:43,333
<i>It's okay, you do plastic</i>
<i>surgery for it</i>

906
01:09:45,873 --> 01:09:48,171
<i>Hey, spring hair, come here</i>

907
01:09:50,044 --> 01:09:53,502
<i>Do you've the pratice of looking at your</i>
<i>face in the mirror in the morning?</i>

908
01:09:57,384 --> 01:09:58,180
<i>What'll be seen?</i>

909
01:09:59,053 --> 01:10:00,520
<i>My beautiful face, Dear</i>

910
01:10:01,388 --> 01:10:01,854
<i>No!</i>

911
01:10:03,223 --> 01:10:05,521
<i>A monkey which had escaped</i>
<i>from the Zoo</i>

912
01:10:43,263 --> 01:10:46,391
<i>The one who has created my</i>
<i>nose of a big size</i>

913
01:10:46,767 --> 01:10:50,066
<i>Is the one who had created</i>
<i>little brains for you</i>

914
01:10:50,771 --> 01:10:56,732
<i>Are you a human or monkey?</i>

915
01:11:00,447 --> 01:11:04,076
Guru, why do you keep the one in the
Bakery which should be in the Zoo?

916
01:11:15,129 --> 01:11:16,255
Looking as if very
proud girl

917
01:11:16,797 --> 01:11:18,924
Hey, can she speak irrespectfully
by seeing our Deva?

918
01:11:19,133 --> 01:11:19,929
Pour some more

919
01:11:21,468 --> 01:11:23,936
She'll reform, if we make her
starve for 4 days

920
01:11:24,972 --> 01:11:26,439
I'll tell you one thing
meaningfully

921
01:11:27,141 --> 01:11:29,268
You got nose cut by talking
about face cut-you

922
01:11:32,646 --> 01:11:34,614
Gone! Even this plan has
been destroyed

923
01:11:37,651 --> 01:11:39,949
I'll agree! Something is
there in her

924
01:11:40,821 --> 01:11:41,788
You don't worry, sir

925
01:11:43,157 --> 01:11:46,126
Deva will provoke love
in her heart

926
01:11:47,661 --> 01:11:48,628
I'll make her to love
you sir

927
01:11:48,996 --> 01:11:49,792
I'll swear sir

928
01:11:50,164 --> 01:11:50,960
I am telling you
surely sir

929
01:12:05,179 --> 01:12:05,975
What's the problem
doctor?

930
01:12:07,848 --> 01:12:09,975
He's saved! But he's in
a serious condition

931
01:12:10,517 --> 01:12:11,643
Shouldn't give him any
tension

932
01:12:12,019 --> 01:12:12,485
House tension

933
01:12:13,854 --> 01:12:14,821
Does he have any son?

934
01:12:15,522 --> 01:12:16,147
I am his daughter

935
01:12:16,857 --> 01:12:17,824
But, to look after the
business

936
01:12:18,025 --> 01:12:18,992
Do you've any brothers?

937
01:12:19,193 --> 01:12:20,160
I'll manage the business

938
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:21,827
She's well educated, she'll
manage it

939
01:12:22,196 --> 01:12:23,493
But, they told that you're
going to go somewhere?

940
01:12:24,698 --> 01:12:26,165
I'll manage business

941
01:12:41,882 --> 01:12:43,179
Doctor, has done
excellently

942
01:12:43,717 --> 01:12:45,514
He acted like film artiste
shivaji

943
01:12:46,053 --> 01:12:47,520
She believed it, completely sir

944
01:12:48,555 --> 01:12:50,523
Sir, you can act in Movies

945
01:12:50,724 --> 01:12:52,191
Sorry, I made you to act
like this

946
01:12:52,893 --> 01:12:55,020
I've acted in college
dramas

947
01:13:02,569 --> 01:13:05,197
We're manufatcuring this
for 30 yrs, Baby

948
01:13:06,073 --> 01:13:08,541
But no one is buying
this, baby

949
01:13:09,076 --> 01:13:09,542
Why?

950
01:13:10,244 --> 01:13:13,873
Because they're manufacturing
colourful ones in the market

951
01:13:17,417 --> 01:13:20,545
Like this, small one
very modern

952
01:13:21,255 --> 01:13:23,223
It seems public is liking
this only

953
01:13:23,924 --> 01:13:24,720
You yourself tell me
baby

954
01:13:25,092 --> 01:13:27,720
Is this looking beautiful
or ours?

955
01:13:27,928 --> 01:13:29,395
What's the beauty in that?

956
01:13:29,930 --> 01:13:30,897
Go... Go... Go

957
01:13:32,933 --> 01:13:35,231
Oh! God why can't we do
another business?

958
01:13:35,435 --> 01:13:36,902
We should ask that to
our boss

959
01:13:37,271 --> 01:13:37,737
Shall I ask him?

960
01:13:37,938 --> 01:13:38,404
"No"

961
01:13:41,942 --> 01:13:44,240
Why can't we manufacture colourful
ones like this?

962
01:13:44,444 --> 01:13:46,742
For that we've to start a
dyeing unit, baby

963
01:13:47,281 --> 01:13:48,908
It may require huge amount
of money, baby

964
01:13:49,616 --> 01:13:50,412
Shall I ask the Boss?

965
01:13:51,118 --> 01:13:51,743
No need

966
01:13:52,786 --> 01:13:54,754
Father is unwell &
he's at home

967
01:13:54,955 --> 01:13:55,922
Don't disturb him

968
01:14:00,794 --> 01:14:05,925
We can create new designs by
buying new machines

969
01:14:06,133 --> 01:14:10,092
In older designs, we've produced in
lot & kept it in the godown, lsn't it

970
01:14:10,804 --> 01:14:12,101
What to do with that
Baby?

971
01:14:13,307 --> 01:14:14,774
Why did you manufacture
so much?

972
01:14:14,975 --> 01:14:16,272
We should ask that to
our boss

973
01:14:18,979 --> 01:14:19,946
No need... No need... No need

974
01:14:23,817 --> 01:14:26,786
Draw the designs &
show me

975
01:14:26,987 --> 01:14:27,954
Sir, tomorrow...

976
01:14:28,322 --> 01:14:30,290
No, you'll simply nod
your head

977
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:30,956
Draw & show me now

978
01:14:31,658 --> 01:14:32,625
I need that within 1 hr

979
01:14:37,998 --> 01:14:39,966
Sir, Look here... at
this plan

980
01:14:44,171 --> 01:14:45,138
No, you didn't disturb
me at all

981
01:14:45,339 --> 01:14:47,136
No work, I am free now

982
01:14:48,342 --> 01:14:49,309
If there's any doubt you can
ask me at any time

983
01:14:50,344 --> 01:14:50,969
I'll come there

984
01:14:52,012 --> 01:14:53,479
Don't promise simply

985
01:14:54,348 --> 01:14:55,474
The condition in which my
office is now

986
01:14:55,682 --> 01:14:57,309
I'll ring you up for every
half an hour

987
01:15:00,187 --> 01:15:00,983
I'll come immediately

988
01:15:04,191 --> 01:15:06,159
Sir, Then what happened?

989
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:06,985
Tell me sir?

990
01:15:07,861 --> 01:15:08,486
Then what? That's all

991
01:15:09,363 --> 01:15:10,159
Didn't you tell her?

992
01:15:11,031 --> 01:15:12,999
Oh! God! Sir has missed
the chance

993
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:14,496
Hey okay!

994
01:15:15,202 --> 01:15:15,998
What can I do?

995
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:18,668
Whenever I meet her, I am
becoming speechless

996
01:15:20,707 --> 01:15:21,833
I think something will happen to
the persons who love

997
01:15:22,042 --> 01:15:23,009
They'll call it as
Love sick

998
01:15:25,212 --> 01:15:27,680
I became sick on the very
first day I met her

999
01:15:28,048 --> 01:15:29,515
I'll tell you one thing
meaningfully

1000
01:15:29,716 --> 01:15:31,183
We'll get a kick if
we drink Beer

1001
01:15:31,385 --> 01:15:32,511
We'll get sick, if
we love

1002
01:15:34,554 --> 01:15:36,522
Deva, what did you do?
When you fell in love?

1003
01:15:36,723 --> 01:15:38,691
Love? I didn't even pass
that side

1004
01:15:39,393 --> 01:15:40,860
Sir, he's lying

1005
01:15:42,062 --> 01:15:44,030
He'll write a book about love
& he didn't fall in Love?

1006
01:15:44,564 --> 01:15:45,690
Sir, shall I ask you
one thing?

1007
01:15:45,899 --> 01:15:47,526
Can we become a heart doctor
only if we get heart attack?

1008
01:15:47,734 --> 01:15:49,702
Sir, don't listen to it

1009
01:15:50,237 --> 01:15:52,364
I'll tell you, Deva's
love story

1010
01:15:52,572 --> 01:15:53,539
I'll kill you, Dog

1011
01:15:55,742 --> 01:15:56,868
Superb girl, sir

1012
01:15:57,244 --> 01:15:59,212
Purse is fit & her blouse
is fit

1013
01:15:59,746 --> 01:16:01,213
Instead of doing hair cut
for her

1014
01:16:01,748 --> 01:16:02,373
He trapped her

1015
01:16:05,919 --> 01:16:07,045
Hey, what do you all think
of yourselves?

1016
01:16:08,255 --> 01:16:09,381
That's all, I can't run beyond
this

1017
01:16:09,589 --> 01:16:12,888
Sir, don't believe them, they've
come to spoil my name

1018
01:16:13,093 --> 01:16:14,060
Guru, you tell him

1019
01:16:14,995 --> 01:16:18,226
One day, she asked me to come for tea
without her father's knowledge

1020
01:16:18,432 --> 01:16:18,898
...Where?

1021
01:16:19,099 --> 01:16:19,497
To her house...

1022
01:16:20,333 --> 01:16:22,563
When he went to her house, Tea
as well as the Girl both were hot

1023
01:16:23,270 --> 01:16:26,637
My temperature also increased
- Then? -He hugged her

1024
01:16:28,575 --> 01:16:30,406
What happened?
- Father enters...

1025
01:16:30,977 --> 01:16:34,913
Girl introduced him saying he's
working in the 5 star Hotel

1026
01:16:35,615 --> 01:16:38,413
He asked,"What's your work"?

1027
01:16:44,624 --> 01:16:46,091
Do you know, what the Father did?

1028
01:16:46,393 --> 01:16:46,916
Whipped out a knife?

1029
01:16:47,127 --> 01:16:52,861
No, He took out the purse & gave
Rs.100 for Hair cut

1030
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:54,328
From that day the boy says no
to love, Hey keep quiet...

1031
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:57,669
What are you talking about me?

1032
01:16:58,271 --> 01:16:59,067
That fizzled out isn't it?

1033
01:16:59,539 --> 01:17:00,267
Talk about sir's love

1034
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:01,435
Yes, we'll talk

1035
01:17:01,641 --> 01:17:02,767
Tomorrow you become
a brave man

1036
01:17:03,477 --> 01:17:06,241
Tomorrow blind Guru is
going to fall before a car...

1037
01:17:06,546 --> 01:17:08,878
You're...

1038
01:17:09,216 --> 01:17:11,707
She will see from there & will
be flattered

1039
01:17:12,052 --> 01:17:14,612
For manhood, use our
Tiger skin, underwear

1040
01:17:15,288 --> 01:17:18,052
For ever youthfulness
flower underwear

1041
01:17:18,658 --> 01:17:21,388
To impress wives
yellow underwear...

1042
01:17:32,839 --> 01:17:35,967
Sir, everything is ready, do you
see the white car?

1043
01:17:39,112 --> 01:17:40,136
Seems to be
a purshcart model

1044
01:17:41,681 --> 01:17:45,139
lt'll race even in Sholavaram
There, Guru is standing...

1045
01:17:47,654 --> 01:17:49,645
Car will start, he'll fall
infront of the car...

1046
01:17:50,257 --> 01:17:51,417
You'll run and save him

1047
01:17:52,092 --> 01:17:53,150
How will Priya know that
I've saved him?

1048
01:17:53,894 --> 01:17:55,589
Sir, already I've paid advance
everything is ready...

1049
01:17:55,829 --> 01:17:56,955
As soon he saves him...

1050
01:17:57,364 --> 01:17:59,662
You all must say
"Brave Man has saved, longlive"

1051
01:17:59,866 --> 01:18:00,560
When should we say this?

1052
01:18:01,835 --> 01:18:04,326
When you hear screeching loud brake
noise, its enough if you say it then

1053
01:18:04,538 --> 01:18:06,836
Aha! Brave man...
after hearing the brake sound

1054
01:18:10,210 --> 01:18:12,144
Car is ready, do what I said...

1055
01:18:14,214 --> 01:18:15,010
Don't bungle...

1056
01:18:23,557 --> 01:18:24,023
...Go...

1057
01:18:48,281 --> 01:18:50,306
Oh! Thief... Pickpocket...
- No... l'm Priya...

1058
01:18:57,891 --> 01:18:59,882
Don't go... Don't go...
Listen to me...

1059
01:19:02,095 --> 01:19:02,652
Everything has collapsed...

1060
01:19:02,863 --> 01:19:07,891
Longlive Braveman
Longlive Braveman

1061
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:10,564
What's that noise?

1062
01:19:10,770 --> 01:19:14,900
I've composed a nice tune from
Spanish folk will you listen?

1063
01:19:15,108 --> 01:19:19,408
Longlive Brave man
Longlive Brave man

1064
01:19:31,458 --> 01:19:32,618
You're a jolly type, isn't it?

1065
01:19:32,959 --> 01:19:34,358
Yes... l'm a jolly type

1066
01:19:34,861 --> 01:19:35,919
Then, why are you singing sadly?

1067
01:19:36,363 --> 01:19:37,830
That's... my situation is
like that...

1068
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:06,786
<i>On the branch of Mango tree</i>
<i>at 'Mana Madurai'</i>

1069
01:20:09,195 --> 01:20:12,961
<i>What was the question put</i>
<i>by the Parrot?</i>

1070
01:20:14,134 --> 01:20:19,128
<i>Are my eyes beautiful?</i>
<i>Are my wings beautiful?</i>

1071
01:20:19,806 --> 01:20:24,766
<i>What can I sing if it</i>
<i>asks such question?</i>

1072
01:20:45,332 --> 01:20:49,564
<i>In the western street</i>
<i>on the bullock cart...</i>

1073
01:20:50,337 --> 01:20:54,831
<i>Hey! One maiden is going...</i>

1074
01:20:55,775 --> 01:21:00,269
<i>I asked her, what's the</i>
<i>saree you're wearing?</i>

1075
01:21:00,914 --> 01:21:05,146
<i>She said, it's a rainbow</i>

1076
01:21:05,452 --> 01:21:10,685
<i>As rain drops fall gently on the Earth</i>
<i>a distinct fragrance emanates</i>

1077
01:21:10,890 --> 01:21:15,953
<i>Sometimes that fragrance takes me</i>
<i>to the Rainbow on the Horizon</i>

1078
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:55,365
<i>He gave us Air & Rain</i>
<i>for all of us to live</i>

1079
01:21:57,771 --> 01:22:05,974
<i>... He gave us a song for</i>
<i>everyone to sing</i>

1080
01:22:07,614 --> 01:22:08,546
<i>Like a child...</i>

1081
01:22:09,949 --> 01:22:12,247
<i>There'll no sorrow if we've</i>
<i>a heart like a child</i>

1082
01:22:12,652 --> 01:22:13,584
<i>Like a Bird...</i>

1083
01:22:15,188 --> 01:22:17,884
<i>If we have a body like it</i>
<i>There won't be any fear</i>

1084
01:22:18,291 --> 01:22:27,757
<i>He gave us Earth in ourhands</i>
<i>to live prosperously...</i>

1085
01:23:56,556 --> 01:24:04,691
<i>He gave us fruits to eat</i>
<i>and made human beings sweet</i>

1086
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:15,035
<i>He gave us singing cuckoo &
<i>Poured honey in our ears</i>

1087
01:24:16,709 --> 01:24:21,703
<i>Art is seen in</i>
<i>the lights</i>

1088
01:24:21,915 --> 01:24:27,046
<i>I'm visualizing a picture</i>
<i>in my heart</i>

1089
01:24:27,554 --> 01:24:36,724
<i>He gave us cluster of clouds</i>
<i>and Thunder as their Rhythm</i>

1090
01:24:44,170 --> 01:24:46,764
<i>My son created a sensation</i>
<i>in the Trade fair</i>

1091
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,798
He's very intelligent
- He's your son, isn't it?

1092
01:25:52,505 --> 01:25:57,807
He is not only white, even his
thinking is like white people

1093
01:25:58,678 --> 01:26:00,646
Now in Japan, a Trade Fair
is going to open-What?

1094
01:26:00,847 --> 01:26:02,015
Now, it's going to take place
- Let it take place

1095
01:26:02,015 --> 01:26:03,812
I told him to put up
2 or 3 stalls there...

1096
01:26:04,417 --> 01:26:08,148
Hereafter, Every foreigner will
wear only our underwears

1097
01:26:10,323 --> 01:26:11,688
Give me 2 scotch
- for me?

1098
01:26:11,891 --> 01:26:13,791
For you also don't over do
That too in my account

1099
01:26:14,861 --> 01:26:17,625
Doctor said, lndian Drinks are
not good for health

1100
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:21,163
Don't we know without his telling us?
But foreign drinks are excellent

1101
01:26:28,041 --> 01:26:31,340
He's our guest, How can
you call him indecently?

1102
01:26:34,714 --> 01:26:37,512
If you wear black suits, Do you
think you become a 'Great Man'

1103
01:26:37,717 --> 01:26:39,184
I won't leave you, I'll go
upto higher level

1104
01:26:42,221 --> 01:26:44,348
Battery must be switched off
Ask him to switch it on

1105
01:26:44,891 --> 01:26:45,687
You should only tell him

1106
01:26:45,892 --> 01:26:47,359
Sir, switch on your machine

1107
01:26:48,061 --> 01:26:48,527
What?

1108
01:26:48,728 --> 01:26:49,524
Switch it on...

1109
01:26:51,397 --> 01:26:52,193
How do you know?

1110
01:26:52,398 --> 01:26:53,194
Sir only...

1111
01:26:54,901 --> 01:26:57,028
Greetings sir, I didn't see you...

1112
01:26:57,403 --> 01:27:00,031
I was talking to my Foreign friend
regarding business...

1113
01:27:00,406 --> 01:27:03,705
You're very trim, then
How do you get a Heart Attack?

1114
01:27:04,077 --> 01:27:05,374
All were saying in the town...

1115
01:27:06,746 --> 01:27:12,048
Our Cina Tana was saying that we've
to change the Club President immediately

1116
01:27:12,251 --> 01:27:16,881
I told him that after Amalraj's
death only we'll have Elections

1117
01:27:17,090 --> 01:27:18,887
I'm your efficient man, isn't it?

1118
01:27:19,092 --> 01:27:20,218
Sir, why are you drinking?

1119
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:24,218
I came here to be in peace

1120
01:27:24,764 --> 01:27:26,391
Don't you've peace in
the house?

1121
01:27:28,434 --> 01:27:30,732
Sir, don't worry...

1122
01:27:31,771 --> 01:27:34,239
After Puppy's marriage, everything
will be alright

1123
01:27:35,441 --> 01:27:37,739
Now, Puppy & Thomas are very close

1124
01:27:38,277 --> 01:27:39,073
Repeat it once again...

1125
01:27:41,447 --> 01:27:43,244
You too don't hear properly?

1126
01:27:43,950 --> 01:27:46,077
Puppy & Thomas are very close

1127
01:27:46,452 --> 01:27:49,580
Puppy is looking after the factory
Thomas also looking after the factory

1128
01:27:49,789 --> 01:27:53,088
Two parties have connection...

1129
01:27:57,130 --> 01:28:02,261
...That's... Co-operative business

1130
01:28:05,138 --> 01:28:07,766
In Rs.10 Lottery ticket
A beggar becomes a richman...

1131
01:28:09,142 --> 01:28:12,270
The one who drank arrack
can drink Scotch

1132
01:28:14,814 --> 01:28:18,614
But... you should have culture
in the blood

1133
01:28:19,318 --> 01:28:20,945
It should come from generation
to generation

1134
01:28:22,822 --> 01:28:24,289
We've an account...

1135
01:28:27,994 --> 01:28:28,790
Excellent...

1136
01:28:35,835 --> 01:28:38,804
They've recorded our song which
we had sung in the Trade Fair

1137
01:28:39,005 --> 01:28:39,801
Very nice, isn't it?

1138
01:28:40,006 --> 01:28:41,132
Sir, You've recorded nicely...

1139
01:28:41,841 --> 01:28:43,468
Sir is an Agent of
Recording company

1140
01:28:43,676 --> 01:28:44,802
He has come to book us

1141
01:28:45,678 --> 01:28:46,474
Sir, Sit down...

1142
01:28:48,514 --> 01:28:49,481
Hey! Bring milk for Sir...

1143
01:28:49,682 --> 01:28:50,808
Yuck! Bring Cola for Sir...

1144
01:28:51,517 --> 01:28:53,985
I showed this video to my boss
He was impressed

1145
01:28:56,856 --> 01:28:58,323
Every tune was original...

1146
01:29:00,026 --> 01:29:01,323
That girls voice is nice...

1147
01:29:01,527 --> 01:29:02,323
That girl?

1148
01:29:02,862 --> 01:29:03,829
Which girl?

1149
01:29:04,030 --> 01:29:04,826
Our Priya...

1150
01:29:05,531 --> 01:29:09,160
It's obvious from
their dress

1151
01:29:09,535 --> 01:29:11,503
Sir, that girl is going
to become a Nun

1152
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:16,338
If you want to get a chance
that girl should sing

1153
01:29:17,543 --> 01:29:21,172
If you're ready, contact me
on this number...

1154
01:29:25,885 --> 01:29:28,012
Deva, can I forward
the application?

1155
01:29:28,387 --> 01:29:29,354
I should...

1156
01:29:32,391 --> 01:29:33,358
Everything is God's wish...

1157
01:29:34,727 --> 01:29:37,696
Guru, your mother's dreams
are going to come true

1158
01:29:39,232 --> 01:29:41,359
Do you know who they are?

1159
01:29:42,068 --> 01:29:43,695
They're going to become
great singers

1160
01:29:47,073 --> 01:29:49,041
They've got a recording contract...

1161
01:29:49,575 --> 01:29:51,873
Don't say 'They', say 'Us'

1162
01:29:52,745 --> 01:29:53,370
Me...

1163
01:29:54,413 --> 01:29:55,209
Baby is going to sing?

1164
01:29:55,915 --> 01:29:59,214
From childhood itself
she's a great singer

1165
01:29:59,418 --> 01:30:00,385
Sagayam, keep quiet...

1166
01:30:04,590 --> 01:30:05,386
...I can't...

1167
01:30:06,592 --> 01:30:09,060
It seems madam can't sing...
I'll go...

1168
01:30:09,595 --> 01:30:12,063
Don't be in hurry
madam also

1169
01:30:12,265 --> 01:30:13,391
From her childhood, madam has
been very eager to sing

1170
01:30:16,269 --> 01:30:19,238
Now... She's a Nun...
God... serve...

1171
01:30:19,438 --> 01:30:21,565
Your service is very important
to we poor people also

1172
01:30:28,781 --> 01:30:31,249
If she accepts also
will she sing duet songs?

1173
01:30:32,451 --> 01:30:34,578
It's enough even if she sings
only devotional songs

1174
01:30:51,470 --> 01:30:52,437
What are you doing?

1175
01:30:52,638 --> 01:30:56,096
Please, you should only save us

1176
01:30:57,977 --> 01:30:59,274
There's a catch in the neck

1177
01:31:03,649 --> 01:31:04,616
Hey! Don't hurt me

1178
01:31:08,154 --> 01:31:09,621
Deva, What happened?

1179
01:31:11,824 --> 01:31:12,791
Some other sound is coming

1180
01:31:14,827 --> 01:31:16,795
Big house... ls there a witch here?

1181
01:31:23,169 --> 01:31:25,467
Nice! What's going on here?

1182
01:31:25,671 --> 01:31:29,129
Accept it... Accept...

1183
01:31:30,843 --> 01:31:32,970
Should I've to sing?

1184
01:31:33,179 --> 01:31:35,647
Yes... Yes...

1185
01:31:36,682 --> 01:31:41,642
Till you get another singer...

1186
01:32:21,394 --> 01:32:22,520
Hey! Useless fellows...

1187
01:32:23,229 --> 01:32:26,687
Don't you've any other time
for this uproar?

1188
01:32:27,233 --> 01:32:29,360
I had asked you to prepare Roti
and you're hitting this?

1189
01:32:29,735 --> 01:32:31,532
Uncle, I'm telling you an
important thing...

1190
01:32:31,737 --> 01:32:35,036
If we prepare breakfast we'll get money
If we hit this, song will come

1191
01:32:35,408 --> 01:32:37,035
Do you want money or song?

1192
01:32:38,077 --> 01:32:40,875
If I hit you, you can count
your bones...

1193
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:45,380
Uncle, when they release their
song cassette, they'll become popular

1194
01:32:45,584 --> 01:32:47,552
Then, you'll be honoured for
their popularity

1195
01:32:49,088 --> 01:32:50,885
They'll paste our poster...

1196
01:32:51,090 --> 01:32:52,557
If you want, we'll give a place
for your photo

1197
01:32:53,259 --> 01:32:56,228
Don't act too smart with me...
I've seen many...

1198
01:32:56,595 --> 01:32:58,222
What British man had said?

1199
01:33:00,599 --> 01:33:02,226
Atleast today, give me leave

1200
01:33:02,435 --> 01:33:02,901
Give...

1201
01:33:03,269 --> 01:33:04,736
Only few days are more
for audition

1202
01:33:05,104 --> 01:33:06,571
We've to rehearse day & night

1203
01:33:09,775 --> 01:33:10,571
Today is Sunday?

1204
01:33:18,284 --> 01:33:19,911
In Church, on Sundays
they'll have Mass

1205
01:33:20,119 --> 01:33:21,245
I've missed it...

1206
01:33:21,454 --> 01:33:22,921
Now, it woul've been over

1207
01:33:33,632 --> 01:33:37,432
Sir, still how many days you're
going to put up Heart Attack drama?

1208
01:33:37,803 --> 01:33:38,770
Till Puppy changes her mind...

1209
01:33:39,305 --> 01:33:41,432
There is change in
Puppy madam's activities

1210
01:33:42,475 --> 01:33:45,444
She's putting lipstick
she's laughing loudly...

1211
01:33:45,811 --> 01:33:46,937
She's joking...

1212
01:33:47,813 --> 01:33:50,281
You shouldn't delay
in her marriage

1213
01:33:50,816 --> 01:33:52,943
Start the marriage matter...

1214
01:33:53,319 --> 01:33:55,446
I can recognise her change
But, will she accept for marriage?

1215
01:33:55,654 --> 01:33:57,281
If we find a good groom
she'll accept for marriage

1216
01:33:57,490 --> 01:34:00,118
Last time, the groom who came
was so thin...

1217
01:34:00,493 --> 01:34:01,960
Groom should've personality, isn't it?

1218
01:34:04,830 --> 01:34:07,628
I'll bring a Groom
of good personality...

1219
01:34:07,833 --> 01:34:08,629
Let's see whether
she accepts...

1220
01:34:10,503 --> 01:34:12,130
Priya will cook nicely...

1221
01:34:13,506 --> 01:34:15,974
He's Mr. David Vector Appasamy

1222
01:34:16,175 --> 01:34:17,642
From generations, they're boiling...

1223
01:34:17,843 --> 01:34:20,971
I mean... they're boiling sugarcane juice
& he's a Owner of the Sugar mill

1224
01:34:27,853 --> 01:34:30,822
I've put Korean Grass in
my garden... shall we go there?

1225
01:34:33,859 --> 01:34:34,484
What's it?

1226
01:34:37,363 --> 01:34:37,988
...Didn't listen to you?

1227
01:34:40,533 --> 01:34:44,162
...I thought, I didn't want...
He's having children...

1228
01:34:48,541 --> 01:34:50,668
...Okay... carry on...

1229
01:34:58,717 --> 01:35:01,686
I heard that you're
a peculiar man

1230
01:35:02,388 --> 01:35:03,355
I'm also like that...

1231
01:35:04,557 --> 01:35:06,525
It seems, you're looking
after the factory

1232
01:35:08,227 --> 01:35:10,695
Do you've any problem from Union Leaders?
I'll bump them off...

1233
01:35:11,897 --> 01:35:14,365
Not in Union
everyone is good

1234
01:35:18,070 --> 01:35:20,197
Do you've enemies apart from
your business?

1235
01:35:21,574 --> 01:35:24,702
No... let's talk... lf they didn't
listen, we'll bump them off

1236
01:35:27,580 --> 01:35:30,549
You should bump off someone
only then, they'll fear us

1237
01:35:33,586 --> 01:35:36,384
If I didn't accept for marriage
Will you bump off me too?

1238
01:35:42,428 --> 01:35:43,554
You're very peculiar

1239
01:35:53,105 --> 01:35:53,901
Will she accept?

1240
01:35:55,274 --> 01:35:56,901
If Priya marries someone else?

1241
01:35:57,443 --> 01:35:59,070
Sir, Why one you talking like this?

1242
01:35:59,778 --> 01:36:02,246
Sir, she's only for you
There's no doubt in it

1243
01:36:03,282 --> 01:36:04,749
Priya is a nice girl

1244
01:36:05,117 --> 01:36:07,286
But sometimes
To make a father happy

1245
01:36:07,286 --> 01:36:09,083
Girls will accept for marriage
as their father's wish for

1246
01:36:10,956 --> 01:36:13,754
If it happens like that
There's no meaning of my living

1247
01:36:15,794 --> 01:36:17,591
Sir, what's this?
Sir, cost of a Litre?

1248
01:36:20,466 --> 01:36:22,593
Take this... Fill the tank as much as
you can... fill the tank

1249
01:36:24,803 --> 01:36:25,770
Ensure it Zero & then fill it

1250
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:30,268
Don't believe these persons They'll
steal a point & build another station

1251
01:36:33,646 --> 01:36:35,614
Sir, leave it... Don't get tensed...
Forget it...

1252
01:36:36,649 --> 01:36:40,608
Sir, I had taken so much
pain to setup that girl

1253
01:36:40,986 --> 01:36:43,284
In between, lf someone takes her...
will I leave him?

1254
01:36:43,822 --> 01:36:44,618
Directly, I'll kill him...

1255
01:36:44,823 --> 01:36:46,290
Hey! Think while you talk...

1256
01:36:46,825 --> 01:36:47,951
He's a big shot in Madras

1257
01:36:48,327 --> 01:36:50,955
Not only you, he'll kill your father
Grandfather and grandmother

1258
01:36:51,997 --> 01:36:52,793
...He'll kill...

1259
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:55,967
There's no change, Go!

1260
01:36:57,002 --> 01:36:59,300
Those who come in Benz car
Don't have change means...

1261
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:03,637
You've good time

1262
01:37:09,682 --> 01:37:11,309
Wait... l'll come... wait!

1263
01:37:13,018 --> 01:37:13,814
Go...

1264
01:37:15,854 --> 01:37:16,980
Sorry, Yesterday, I was
not able to come

1265
01:37:17,189 --> 01:37:18,816
Tomorrow at 10am I'll come
Take this...

1266
01:37:19,358 --> 01:37:20,825
Have it... Go... Go...

1267
01:37:22,695 --> 01:37:23,662
Sir, You're a peculiar person...

1268
01:37:24,363 --> 01:37:26,160
Morning, you're doing business
with foreigners

1269
01:37:26,865 --> 01:37:28,492
And in the night, You're doing
business with beggars

1270
01:37:29,034 --> 01:37:30,160
I can't understand you...

1271
01:37:31,203 --> 01:37:33,671
No... We've many small clothes
in the factory...

1272
01:37:33,872 --> 01:37:35,499
I'll stitch shirts from them
And I'll give it to them...

1273
01:37:35,874 --> 01:37:36,841
Then, Priya?

1274
01:37:38,877 --> 01:37:39,502
Where will you give?

1275
01:37:41,380 --> 01:37:42,677
At the backside of the station

1276
01:37:44,383 --> 01:37:46,351
Then tell Priya's father
- When?

1277
01:37:48,053 --> 01:37:48,849
At 10.00am

1278
01:37:55,728 --> 01:37:57,855
Your uncle would've drank
and slept somewhere

1279
01:38:03,402 --> 01:38:04,369
What? How did you get hurt?

1280
01:38:04,737 --> 01:38:06,534
Sir, I don't know, car driver
hit him and went away...

1281
01:38:06,739 --> 01:38:07,535
He didn't stop!

1282
01:38:09,908 --> 01:38:10,875
Nearby, ls there any hospital?

1283
01:38:11,410 --> 01:38:12,877
You should go there...

1284
01:38:13,412 --> 01:38:14,879
Before carrying him, dog will die...

1285
01:38:17,416 --> 01:38:18,883
I can't understand about them...

1286
01:38:19,084 --> 01:38:19,550
Madam, What's it?

1287
01:38:19,752 --> 01:38:21,379
Half of the time, they're
spending to earn money

1288
01:38:22,421 --> 01:38:24,719
Another half of the time
they're spending that money

1289
01:38:26,592 --> 01:38:28,560
Why do they lead a false life?

1290
01:38:30,429 --> 01:38:32,897
Life is to do service to others!!

1291
01:38:33,432 --> 01:38:34,399
Madam, There's no doubt about it...

1292
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:39,400
I'll introduce you the future
Princes of your aim...

1293
01:38:40,439 --> 01:38:43,067
Take him... He had left the
house at the age of 8 Yrs itself...

1294
01:38:43,442 --> 01:38:44,739
Now, from corporation, they're
going to give a degree

1295
01:38:44,943 --> 01:38:45,739
...of 'Doctorate of Garbages'

1296
01:38:46,278 --> 01:38:47,245
He's working hard whole night

1297
01:38:47,446 --> 01:38:47,912
Why?

1298
01:38:48,447 --> 01:38:49,243
To smoke Cannabis

1299
01:38:49,448 --> 01:38:49,914
Madam, come here...

1300
01:38:50,282 --> 01:38:50,907
He is...

1301
01:38:51,784 --> 01:38:53,752
Madam, not he... Next to him...

1302
01:38:53,952 --> 01:38:54,577
Is it him?

1303
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:55,745
Only 17 Yrs

1304
01:38:56,789 --> 01:38:58,416
Boys will buy cotton candy
And groundnut candy

1305
01:38:58,957 --> 01:39:01,926
He has bought Aids
He's distuributing it daily...

1306
01:39:03,796 --> 01:39:05,764
Madam, truely this boy
is poor...

1307
01:39:06,465 --> 01:39:11,425
His mother had leprosy
So, they have thrown him also out

1308
01:39:11,637 --> 01:39:12,103
What's this injustice?

1309
01:39:14,473 --> 01:39:15,770
The leader who is
sleeping there...

1310
01:39:17,309 --> 01:39:18,276
He drank & slept on the bridge...

1311
01:39:19,812 --> 01:39:20,779
He lost his legs

1312
01:39:24,149 --> 01:39:25,946
Madam, so soon
you get disgusted!

1313
01:39:26,485 --> 01:39:27,952
Hereafter, you're going to
stay with them, isn't it?

1314
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:29,287
So, what I'm trying
to say is...

1315
01:39:29,488 --> 01:39:30,785
Marry a handsome guy...

1316
01:39:30,989 --> 01:39:33,457
Instead of coming in the
A.C. Car...

1317
01:39:33,659 --> 01:39:35,627
You're thinking of
doing services...

1318
01:39:36,161 --> 01:39:38,129
So, do you think, my services
are a waste?

1319
01:39:38,497 --> 01:39:39,122
Madam, there's no doubt in it...

1320
01:39:40,999 --> 01:39:42,296
You don't know about me...

1321
01:39:42,501 --> 01:39:42,967
So?

1322
01:39:44,336 --> 01:39:45,633
Till you say 'enough'-

1323
01:39:46,839 --> 01:39:48,636
Shall I sit here itself
And how you?

1324
01:40:04,189 --> 01:40:05,156
Madam, I am angry

1325
01:40:05,691 --> 01:40:06,988
No one cares for him...

1326
01:40:07,526 --> 01:40:10,324
Let it be any party
Their place is platform only

1327
01:40:13,532 --> 01:40:14,499
Madam, they're very poor

1328
01:40:16,535 --> 01:40:19,834
Mother Indira
What a brave Woman!

1329
01:40:20,205 --> 01:40:25,165
If I was in her period I would've
done different hairstyles for her...

1330
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:29,177
If I put plait for you
lt'll be nice

1331
01:40:29,381 --> 01:40:30,348
Go...

1332
01:40:31,550 --> 01:40:32,847
Just try it once, if you don't
like, leave it

1333
01:40:33,552 --> 01:40:34,519
Madam, try once...

1334
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:35,846
He'll be coming late
- Who?

1335
01:40:36,889 --> 01:40:37,856
Moon will appear late...

1336
01:40:45,063 --> 01:40:46,189
It's visible
infront of my eyes

1337
01:40:46,398 --> 01:40:46,864
What?

1338
01:40:47,900 --> 01:40:48,696
One big Church

1339
01:40:49,902 --> 01:40:54,532
There you're coming
like an Angel...

1340
01:40:56,241 --> 01:40:59,870
A handsome husband
is standing near you

1341
01:41:01,580 --> 01:41:03,548
You're always talking about marriage
you become a broker

1342
01:41:04,583 --> 01:41:05,709
If you talk further
I'll go

1343
01:41:06,251 --> 01:41:07,047
...Don't talk...

1344
01:41:25,270 --> 01:41:30,230
<i>Oh Moon! Will you come out</i>
<i>from the Sky?</i>

1345
01:41:30,609 --> 01:41:33,237
<i>I need a pair to play</i>

1346
01:42:17,589 --> 01:42:26,395
<i>Before anyone sees on the Earth</i>
<i>I'll send you back early in the morning</i>

1347
01:42:59,865 --> 01:43:02,333
<i>This is neither a night</i>
<i>Nor a day...</i>

1348
01:43:02,701 --> 01:43:05,169
<i>This is the Golden time which</i>
<i>doesn't represent either of them</i>

1349
01:43:13,045 --> 01:43:15,343
<i>Don't tilt your head</i>
<i>Don't close your eyes...</i>

1350
01:43:15,714 --> 01:43:18,182
<i>Suddenly some buds</i>
<i>will blossom!</i>

1351
01:43:18,717 --> 01:43:23,677
<i>Oh! Maiden... Oh! Maiden!!</i>

1352
01:43:24,056 --> 01:43:28,686
<i>After everyone sleeps</i>
<i>on the Earth...</i>

1353
01:43:29,394 --> 01:43:33,353
<i>We can hear the flowers</i>
<i>talking to the grass</i>

1354
01:43:34,399 --> 01:43:36,697
<i>We'll be children on</i>
<i>the lap of the night</i>

1355
01:43:37,069 --> 01:43:40,038
<i>Moon is there to sing</i>
<i>lullaby for us!</i>

1356
01:44:59,918 --> 01:45:03,376
<i>Who has placed the Moon?</i>
<i>So far away</i>

1357
01:45:04,156 --> 01:45:08,786
<i>Who has created Air</i>
<i>which can't be trapped in our hands?</i>

1358
01:45:09,161 --> 01:45:14,463
<i>By thinking about these</i>
<i>I'm astonished about nature!!</i>

1359
01:45:14,833 --> 01:45:19,133
<i>Who has placed the Moon?</i>
<i>So far away</i>

1360
01:45:20,172 --> 01:45:24,131
<i>Oh! Maiden... Oh! Maiden...</i>

1361
01:45:25,510 --> 01:45:29,810
<i>Without the knowledge of the Breeze</i>
<i>We should blossom the flower!!</i>

1362
01:45:30,515 --> 01:45:34,474
<i>Even without the knowledge of flower</i>
<i>We should taste the Honey!</i>

1363
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:40,981
<i>I should admire the world</i>
<i>Along with a girl like you!!</i>

1364
01:46:43,588 --> 01:46:45,556
Hey! Thomas Sir!

1365
01:46:56,434 --> 01:46:57,401
Don't be in a hurry...
Everyone will get...

1366
01:46:58,603 --> 01:47:00,230
Sir, today, why did you come late?

1367
01:47:00,605 --> 01:47:03,233
On the way
The dog got hurt...

1368
01:47:20,625 --> 01:47:21,592
What are you doing here?

1369
01:47:22,627 --> 01:47:24,595
That's... This song... No

1370
01:47:26,965 --> 01:47:28,592
I've laid a bet with my friends

1371
01:47:29,634 --> 01:47:31,602
Full night here...

1372
01:47:34,472 --> 01:47:35,439
Cheeks have become Red...

1373
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:37,608
What? Cheeks...

1374
01:47:38,143 --> 01:47:38,609
No...

1375
01:47:40,979 --> 01:47:41,604
I'm feeling cold and
I am shivering

1376
01:47:42,647 --> 01:47:43,272
Take it...

1377
01:47:45,650 --> 01:47:47,948
Thomas! What happened?

1378
01:47:48,153 --> 01:47:51,452
Nothing! While coming
A dog got hurt

1379
01:47:51,990 --> 01:47:52,615
It's dog's blood...

1380
01:47:57,495 --> 01:47:59,292
Helping others and giving charity...

1381
01:47:59,497 --> 01:48:00,464
It is like a eating sweets for him

1382
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,127
Deva, do you know him?

1383
01:48:04,336 --> 01:48:07,635
I know him very well
But, He doesn't know me

1384
01:48:08,173 --> 01:48:09,470
I'll see him here frequently

1385
01:48:09,841 --> 01:48:10,967
He'll come sharply at 10.00

1386
01:48:11,676 --> 01:48:16,636
He'll buy cakes & clothes for
The boys whom we've seen

1387
01:48:17,349 --> 01:48:18,475
But, Sir is little late...

1388
01:48:20,685 --> 01:48:23,153
Is he your friend?

1389
01:48:24,689 --> 01:48:26,316
He's Deva
Good Musician

1390
01:48:30,028 --> 01:48:31,325
That's part time...

1391
01:48:40,705 --> 01:48:43,003
You'll cut for gents or ladies?

1392
01:48:43,708 --> 01:48:44,174
Both!

1393
01:48:47,045 --> 01:48:49,013
You've an AC car
isn't it?

1394
01:48:50,715 --> 01:48:53,013
If you drop madam
You know her home, isn't it?

1395
01:48:54,052 --> 01:48:55,349
It's getting late for madam!

1396
01:49:20,412 --> 01:49:23,381
Don't mistake me for leaving
You infront of the gate

1397
01:49:25,083 --> 01:49:29,543
I don't know whether uncle
will like to see us together

1398
01:49:30,588 --> 01:49:34,046
So what?
I like Thomas

1399
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:36,727
You're helping me very much

1400
01:49:37,429 --> 01:49:38,726
If I didn't talk to you
How will it be?

1401
01:49:41,433 --> 01:49:45,233
Whether he likes or not
I won't give up your friendship

1402
01:50:21,973 --> 01:50:23,941
It was right to meet
her & speak with her...

1403
01:50:24,142 --> 01:50:24,767
But, we shouldn't have sung...

1404
01:50:27,145 --> 01:50:29,272
Deva, you've lost your control...
you've lost...

1405
01:50:31,549 --> 01:50:31,981
Why do I need it?

1406
01:50:33,985 --> 01:50:35,953
What's the relationship between
me & that girl?

1407
01:50:36,821 --> 01:50:38,118
I can't understand her talk

1408
01:50:39,791 --> 01:50:41,952
She suits only Thomas

1409
01:50:45,497 --> 01:50:48,523
Slowly, I should steer her towards
Thomas & I should move away from them

1410
01:50:50,435 --> 01:50:51,094
...I must move away

1411
01:50:53,738 --> 01:50:57,970
100's of girls are there for me to love
why do I need her?

1412
01:51:00,845 --> 01:51:05,145
That girl... she has something
in her eyes isn't it?

1413
01:51:09,354 --> 01:51:10,343
What are you blabbering?

1414
01:51:11,589 --> 01:51:11,987
Didn't you sleep?

1415
01:51:13,925 --> 01:51:16,086
You'll sleep off as soon as
you lie down

1416
01:51:17,095 --> 01:51:17,857
Did you come just now?

1417
01:51:19,731 --> 01:51:25,670
Has our plan worked out?
- Yes somewhat...

1418
01:51:25,937 --> 01:51:26,665
Somewhat means?

1419
01:51:28,306 --> 01:51:28,965
Didn't Thomas come?

1420
01:51:29,541 --> 01:51:31,771
He came... but little late...

1421
01:51:32,377 --> 01:51:36,939
So what if he came late?
Priya saw him giving alms, isn't it?

1422
01:51:37,882 --> 01:51:40,350
Then, she'll Love him... Has she
started loving him?

1423
01:51:42,287 --> 01:51:43,345
Yes, may be...

1424
01:51:43,988 --> 01:51:48,584
Thomas is a nice person...

1425
01:51:49,894 --> 01:51:51,885
Priya also is a good
natured girl

1426
01:51:53,665 --> 01:51:56,327
Hey! They're a good pair, isn't it?

1427
01:52:00,138 --> 01:52:01,469
Why are you getting irritated?

1428
01:52:02,607 --> 01:52:06,668
No... This moon... is dazzling
my eyes

1429
01:52:08,079 --> 01:52:10,479
Sometimes, it's good to be Blind

1430
01:52:58,329 --> 01:53:00,889
Come & see, who has come here...

1431
01:53:14,112 --> 01:53:15,044
You didn't expect me, isn't it?

1432
01:53:16,114 --> 01:53:18,241
I was going for Easter retreat

1433
01:53:18,750 --> 01:53:23,619
On the way, I came here
to see you...

1434
01:53:24,722 --> 01:53:26,656
I find there's a glow
on your face...

1435
01:53:28,159 --> 01:53:30,855
Home food & Father's care...

1436
01:53:31,396 --> 01:53:32,658
No, she's only taking care
of me

1437
01:53:33,231 --> 01:53:35,699
Now, look at the house, it has
acquired vibrancy

1438
01:53:36,401 --> 01:53:38,926
Her mother, used to keep like this...

1439
01:53:39,404 --> 01:53:42,237
I can feel the touch of
Priya everywhere

1440
01:53:44,943 --> 01:53:47,776
Truely, I find it very difficult
without you in the Church

1441
01:53:48,846 --> 01:53:51,246
Sister Agnes has sent her
regards to you

1442
01:53:53,051 --> 01:53:57,317
Now, Sister Agnes has changed
But... only slightly...

1443
01:53:58,723 --> 01:54:00,486
We always talk about you...

1444
01:54:04,095 --> 01:54:07,064
About your devotion
your concentration...

1445
01:54:07,198 --> 01:54:08,722
She's giving so many new ideas

1446
01:54:09,467 --> 01:54:11,332
She has got a good
business sense...

1447
01:54:12,437 --> 01:54:18,706
Near the factory... She's going
to build an orphanage for children

1448
01:54:23,081 --> 01:54:25,777
We know her aptitute for
service very well

1449
01:54:27,085 --> 01:54:30,919
She has the blessing of Jesus, we've
the building plan, where is it?

1450
01:54:33,992 --> 01:54:34,754
I'll bring it...

1451
01:54:40,398 --> 01:54:41,558
What's the confusion in
your mind?

1452
01:54:43,401 --> 01:54:45,460
No, Mother... I was
slightly busy...

1453
01:54:46,237 --> 01:54:47,261
That's why, I didn't write
a letter

1454
01:54:48,539 --> 01:54:49,870
I'm just the same...

1455
01:54:51,409 --> 01:54:53,741
After finishing this work, I'll
comeback to the convent

1456
01:54:54,946 --> 01:54:56,038
I'm not talking about that...

1457
01:54:58,249 --> 01:54:59,409
God knows everything

1458
01:55:02,153 --> 01:55:03,415
There's no need for me
to tell you...

1459
01:55:04,822 --> 01:55:07,950
Prayer is the only solution
for all problems

1460
01:55:10,428 --> 01:55:12,362
Let God show you the
Right Path

1461
01:55:34,385 --> 01:55:36,751
Look, last night we went
little overboard

1462
01:55:39,257 --> 01:55:40,281
Let us consider everything
as a dream

1463
01:55:40,992 --> 01:55:45,019
Truely, All ladies are like
my sisters

1464
01:55:46,097 --> 01:55:48,395
Thank God! She's in Good mood

1465
01:55:49,133 --> 01:55:50,532
I should tell her everything...
I shouldn't see her eyes

1466
01:55:50,768 --> 01:55:52,167
Hey! Bravely tell her...

1467
01:55:54,138 --> 01:55:55,969
Look... for me, all the ladies...

1468
01:56:00,311 --> 01:56:01,209
Don't see her eyes...

1469
01:56:02,013 --> 01:56:06,712
It's hot, sour... Why are you sad?
...Tell me

1470
01:56:07,919 --> 01:56:08,442
If you tell me...

1471
01:56:09,353 --> 01:56:09,944
What Research? I
can't uanderstand...

1472
01:56:10,721 --> 01:56:11,813
There's no one to
discipline you

1473
01:56:12,423 --> 01:56:13,117
Then, what?

1474
01:56:13,424 --> 01:56:14,789
What defect has God
given you?

1475
01:56:14,992 --> 01:56:16,619
You've tons of money & you've
a house like a Palace

1476
01:56:17,061 --> 01:56:18,790
If you don't know to utlise them
you're a waste

1477
01:56:19,931 --> 01:56:21,262
Madam... Madam... Look...

1478
01:56:21,466 --> 01:56:23,627
Don't call me 'Madam'
Call me 'Puppy'

1479
01:56:24,669 --> 01:56:26,796
Puppy? It sounds like calling
a... pup

1480
01:56:28,739 --> 01:56:30,400
Oh God! How beautiful she is?

1481
01:56:32,009 --> 01:56:34,773
Deva, Don't look at me like this...
I'm feeling a bit

1482
01:56:35,646 --> 01:56:38,012
Then, you'll tell eyes are not good
& ears are not good...

1483
01:56:38,282 --> 01:56:40,773
Oh! God! I had blabbered
something

1484
01:56:41,419 --> 01:56:42,750
Don't take it seriously

1485
01:56:42,954 --> 01:56:45,752
If you ask me personally
How beautiful you are...

1486
01:56:46,023 --> 01:56:49,584
I meet so many in my parlour
I can Judge just like that

1487
01:56:50,194 --> 01:56:51,252
But... you...

1488
01:56:53,631 --> 01:56:55,360
This eyes... this hair...
or this ears...

1489
01:56:55,566 --> 01:56:56,760
I don't know how to
describe...

1490
01:56:57,201 --> 01:56:57,997
You are like...

1491
01:56:59,003 --> 01:56:59,469
...How?

1492
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:04,166
You're a respectable lady...

1493
01:57:05,042 --> 01:57:09,479
The result of your research
is 'I am an Angel'

1494
01:57:13,584 --> 01:57:15,484
If I want to talk to you I
should keep a Dictionary with me...

1495
01:57:18,523 --> 01:57:19,319
...I don't know why?

1496
01:57:20,291 --> 01:57:22,452
If I'm with you, my mind
is at peace

1497
01:57:23,761 --> 01:57:25,058
What eyes she has?

1498
01:57:26,998 --> 01:57:30,866
If I'm with you for my entire life
- Hey Boy, you've bungled everything

1499
01:57:32,670 --> 01:57:34,035
I can be happy forever...

1500
01:57:50,988 --> 01:57:53,388
<i>What's my beauty?</i>
<i>What's my job?</i>

1501
01:57:53,457 --> 01:57:56,392
<i>Why did you develop</i>
<i>love on me?</i>

1502
01:58:06,671 --> 01:58:12,075
<i>I was flowing like stream when did</i>
<i>the electricity got produced in it?</i>

1503
01:58:12,276 --> 01:58:22,311
<i>Oh! Maiden... Oh! Maiden, My day & night</i>
<i>I am troubled by your memories</i>

1504
01:58:22,820 --> 01:58:27,587
<i>No bee sleeps on the</i>
<i>flowers on rail track</i>

1505
01:58:27,959 --> 01:58:33,420
<i>There's no place in Philosophy to say</i>
<i>whether it's right or wrong...</i>

1506
01:58:49,347 --> 01:58:54,341
<i>Oh! Moon! Don't get frayed</i>
<i>like me...</i>

1507
01:58:54,919 --> 01:58:58,218
<i>Are you also suffering from</i>
<i>'Love Disease'?</i>

1508
01:58:59,390 --> 01:59:04,293
<i>I had kept my heart</i>
<i>like a Garden</i>

1509
01:59:04,495 --> 01:59:10,297
<i>Who's that who striked as a
<i>cyclone and disrupted it?</i>

1510
01:59:31,856 --> 01:59:34,324
What's the use of knowing
world news?

1511
01:59:34,959 --> 01:59:36,756
You don't know what's happening
in the house?

1512
01:59:38,195 --> 01:59:40,493
Again, Puppy Madam's mind
has got confused

1513
01:59:41,032 --> 01:59:44,001
You should've arranged her marriage
when she was in good mood

1514
01:59:44,602 --> 01:59:47,196
Whichever groom we're proposing
she's not liking him

1515
01:59:47,705 --> 01:59:50,936
Why should we select the Groom
Puppy herself has selected... one

1516
01:59:51,809 --> 01:59:53,071
What's lacking in Thomas?

1517
01:59:54,111 --> 01:59:55,476
Puppy is also in love
with that boy

1518
01:59:56,380 --> 01:59:58,507
Our girl should live happily
That's what we must wish isn't it?

1519
01:59:59,016 --> 02:00:02,508
Don't spoil your daughter's life
because of false prestige

1520
02:00:02,987 --> 02:00:04,852
Go to that Thomas
- Don't utter his name again

1521
02:00:05,489 --> 02:00:06,183
...l'll not accept...

1522
02:00:13,698 --> 02:00:14,687
Who has come man?

1523
02:00:16,067 --> 02:00:19,764
At this odd hour...
sir... Greetings... you?

1524
02:00:20,204 --> 02:00:22,502
Hey! Call madam... Look
who has come...

1525
02:00:22,707 --> 02:00:23,605
Madam has gone to the club

1526
02:00:23,808 --> 02:00:24,399
There's no other work for her...

1527
02:00:25,042 --> 02:00:28,034
Sir, if ladies get money, they'll never stay
at home, they'll go to club

1528
02:00:28,446 --> 02:00:29,606
Go & bring coffee for sir-Okay

1529
02:00:29,814 --> 02:00:31,372
Don't add sugar, he has
Diabetes

1530
02:00:32,083 --> 02:00:34,244
...Greetings sir... First time
you've come to my house...,

1531
02:00:36,087 --> 02:00:38,055
Sir, did you see this?
'President's Award'

1532
02:00:38,456 --> 02:00:41,220
This is me at that time
I was wearing silk shirt...

1533
02:00:41,459 --> 02:00:43,984
This is Mr. Sanjeev Reddy, President

1534
02:00:44,428 --> 02:00:48,228
Sir, I got 'President Award'
please sit down

1535
02:00:48,899 --> 02:00:49,888
How are the furnitures?

1536
02:00:50,101 --> 02:00:52,433
I went and personally flew it
from Delhi

1537
02:00:54,205 --> 02:00:57,231
...Nothing, Thangadurai... That is...

1538
02:01:00,044 --> 02:01:02,069
Your son is looking after
your business

1539
02:01:04,281 --> 02:01:05,407
My daughter...

1540
02:01:07,418 --> 02:01:08,407
She's looking after my Business...

1541
02:01:09,253 --> 02:01:11,813
So, what I am thinking is...

1542
02:01:13,457 --> 02:01:17,587
Thangadurai, you want Thomas
to get married... isn't it?

1543
02:01:18,329 --> 02:01:20,263
I want Puppy to get
married...

1544
02:01:21,031 --> 02:01:22,123
We both can become
Kinsmen isn't it?

1545
02:01:22,500 --> 02:01:25,094
Sir, How is it possible?

1546
02:01:25,669 --> 02:01:29,105
You're heriditorily rich and we're
heriditorily Poor... it's impossible sir

1547
02:01:29,874 --> 02:01:30,602
Moreover sir...

1548
02:01:30,875 --> 02:01:33,241
Sir, about that Blood lines
you had mentioned about to me

1549
02:01:33,444 --> 02:01:37,744
It's very difficult to change
my blood line with your blood line

1550
02:01:38,149 --> 02:01:40,913
You won't get... where will you
get blood for such a big body?

1551
02:01:41,118 --> 02:01:42,517
Sir, you should bring
tank loads of blood

1552
02:01:43,454 --> 02:01:44,751
Now, don't talk about the past...

1553
02:01:46,257 --> 02:01:50,956
Thangadurai, you know... that
Puppy wished to become a Nun...

1554
02:01:53,230 --> 02:01:57,462
But, now puppy... loves Thomas...

1555
02:01:58,636 --> 02:02:01,628
She doesn't know how totell me

1556
02:02:02,206 --> 02:02:03,867
I am also unable to ask her...

1557
02:02:05,176 --> 02:02:08,304
Now everythng depends
on your son...

1558
02:02:09,613 --> 02:02:12,810
He should get her acceptance

1559
02:02:13,517 --> 02:02:14,779
Next month itself marriage...

1560
02:02:19,623 --> 02:02:20,988
Hey! Tell Engineer...

1561
02:02:21,525 --> 02:02:24,653
We'll ask him to build
a bridge connecting our factories

1562
02:02:24,862 --> 02:02:27,831
It's long since I ordered for Coffee
Hey! Where are you man?

1563
02:02:32,536 --> 02:02:37,496
...But... Sir, if Priya becomes your wife
will she sing with us?

1564
02:02:38,375 --> 02:02:41,503
...For the voice of Priya...
She should never stop singing

1565
02:02:42,379 --> 02:02:43,346
What's wrong in her
singing with you?

1566
02:02:43,714 --> 02:02:44,681
You all are like
brothers to her!

1567
02:02:45,883 --> 02:02:49,182
Deva, the plans given by you
were all successes

1568
02:02:49,720 --> 02:02:52,188
Now only one last plan
For which, Priya must say okay to it!

1569
02:02:52,389 --> 02:02:53,014
Tell me the plan!

1570
02:02:53,724 --> 02:02:54,691
Sir, tell her directly

1571
02:02:54,892 --> 02:02:55,517
Yes, tell her sir

1572
02:02:55,893 --> 02:02:58,691
I am asking you for a plan
Just because, I can't talk to her directly

1573
02:03:02,399 --> 02:03:03,525
Sir, Kiss her!

1574
02:03:03,734 --> 02:03:06,362
Hey! Yuck! Come on tell him
- He's blabbering

1575
02:03:06,570 --> 02:03:08,367
No Sir! Lt'll work out!

1576
02:03:08,572 --> 02:03:09,869
That's what the expert
has said, isn't it?

1577
02:03:10,074 --> 02:03:11,371
Take her out
somewhere alone

1578
02:03:12,743 --> 02:03:13,869
Where? Where should
I take her?

1579
02:03:14,078 --> 02:03:15,705
Sir, take her to some
Hill place

1580
02:03:15,913 --> 02:03:17,710
They say they get into mood
at such places

1581
02:03:18,082 --> 02:03:20,710
They say there's a Tall Tower
in Paris also, What's that?

1582
02:03:22,253 --> 02:03:24,221
It seems you'll find a
Lot of couples kissing...

1583
02:03:24,421 --> 02:03:25,718
Then, are you asking him
to go to Paris!

1584
02:03:26,257 --> 02:03:28,054
I just repeated lines
Some one had told me

1585
02:03:29,093 --> 02:03:29,718
Then, what shall we do?

1586
02:03:30,261 --> 02:03:32,229
Push her into cold water!

1587
02:03:32,763 --> 02:03:34,890
She'll wet her clothes
Body will become heated

1588
02:03:35,099 --> 02:03:36,566
...She'll hug you hotly!

1589
02:03:37,601 --> 02:03:38,067
You tell me!

1590
02:03:39,436 --> 02:03:41,063
Do you like that Sir
...lt'll happen!

1591
02:03:42,273 --> 02:03:42,898
Didn't I tell you?

1592
02:03:45,442 --> 02:03:47,740
Sir, there's water fall
in Talacona

1593
02:03:48,445 --> 02:03:50,743
Excellent place
Deserted place!

1594
02:03:57,288 --> 02:03:58,414
Where are your friends?

1595
02:03:59,790 --> 02:04:00,256
Who?

1596
02:04:02,293 --> 02:04:03,089
Be careful! Be careful!

1597
02:04:04,628 --> 02:04:06,255
They'll come! On the way
...in the car...

1598
02:04:27,251 --> 02:04:31,620
<i>Golden Lotus Maiden</i>
<i>come near me!</i>

1599

<i>My heart is jumping in joy</i>
<i>come to me, Oh! Beauty!</i>

1600
02:04:38,329 --> 02:04:43,130
<i>A flood has struck and a small</i>
<i>crack has developed in my heart</i>

1601
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:46,298
<i>All this happened</i>
<i>Because of you!</i>

1602
02:05:53,570 --> 02:05:58,200
<i>Standing coloured pink</i>
<i>with bewitching beauty, Honey!</i>

1603
02:05:58,909 --> 02:06:04,541
<i>I've come overwhelmed</i>
<i>by a desire!</i>

1604
02:06:04,915 --> 02:06:09,375
<i>With fear in eyes you're sucking</i>
<i>life out of me, Oh my doe like beauty!</i>

1605
02:06:10,087 --> 02:06:15,889
<i>I've lost myself in the forest of</i>
<i>thick black hair</i>

1606
02:06:16,427 --> 02:06:21,387
<i>A flash light is burning</i>
<i>inside my heart!</i>

1607
02:06:21,932 --> 02:06:26,733
<i>How am I going to</i>
<i>safeguard myself?</i>

1608
02:06:27,271 --> 02:06:29,899
<i>Shall I touch you</i>
<i>to relieve me?</i>

1609
02:07:14,818 --> 02:07:19,278
<i>It's rainy season for the</i>
<i>Beetles to visit the flowers</i>

1610
02:07:20,324 --> 02:07:25,455
<i>It's time, croaking frogs</i>
<i>to find a partner!</i>

1611
02:07:25,996 --> 02:07:30,456
<i>It's time, separated parrot</i>
<i>searches for a partner!</i>

1612
02:07:31,502 --> 02:07:36,804
<i>It's a time which unites</i>
<i>the separated lovers</i>

1613
02:07:37,341 --> 02:07:42,472
<i>Oh! Shy maiden! My desire</i>
<i>will not be fulfilled!</i>

1614
02:07:43,013 --> 02:07:47,973
<i>If I follow the protocol</i>
<i>I'll not be able to fulfill my wish</i>

1615
02:07:48,352 --> 02:07:50,980
<i>Closeness is the langauge</i>
<i>of Love</i>

1616
02:08:45,576 --> 02:08:46,873
Thomas, what are you doing?

1617
02:08:48,412 --> 02:08:49,538
Priya, don't you like me?

1618
02:08:51,248 --> 02:08:52,374
You like me isn't it?

1619
02:08:53,250 --> 02:08:56,048
...You've misunderstood my
friendship with you

1620
02:08:56,920 --> 02:08:57,716
Don't say like that Priya!

1621
02:08:59,923 --> 02:09:02,221
I'll wait for you
any number of years

1622
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:04,727
Not just today or now itself!

1623
02:09:05,929 --> 02:09:07,726
Some day your heart will change
I'll always keep you happy

1624
02:09:07,931 --> 02:09:08,556
Be careful!

1625
02:09:08,765 --> 02:09:11,563
Don't touch me! Don't touch me
Go away! Go away!

1626
02:09:11,768 --> 02:09:13,395
Look, You're hating me
you're avoiding me!

1627
02:09:14,605 --> 02:09:15,572
...Priya, I am not
a bad person

1628
02:09:16,940 --> 02:09:18,407
...You don't know how much
I love you!

1629
02:09:18,942 --> 02:09:21,911
What happened to you?
Why are you talking like this?

1630
02:09:22,613 --> 02:09:24,080
Go away, before they
come here!

1631
02:09:26,283 --> 02:09:28,751
No one will come here
They know that we are here!

1632
02:09:32,456 --> 02:09:33,923
I should've thought about it
It had happened, because of them only

1633
02:09:35,125 --> 02:09:35,750
Because of whom?

1634
02:09:37,794 --> 02:09:39,762
All because of Deva!

1635
02:09:44,801 --> 02:09:46,098
He's the one who gave me
ideas from the beginning

1636
02:09:49,806 --> 02:09:50,602
Till that Trade Fair!

1637
02:09:51,642 --> 02:09:53,109
...Making you to see me giving
Clothes to Orphan children

1638
02:09:53,644 --> 02:09:54,440
...Today, he only told me to...

1639
02:10:01,485 --> 02:10:08,288
Priya don't avoid me...
Don't hate me... Don't hate me

1640
02:10:38,021 --> 02:10:41,149
Hey! Come... come here

1641
02:10:42,526 --> 02:10:44,323
Where's Priya?

1642
02:10:45,529 --> 02:10:46,496
Deva, where's Priya?

1643
02:10:47,364 --> 02:10:47,989
How do I know?

1644
02:10:48,198 --> 02:10:49,165
What do you mean by it
You could've brought her, isn't it?

1645
02:10:49,700 --> 02:10:50,997
Is, she is a baby
to pick her up!

1646
02:10:51,201 --> 02:10:52,168
You could've picked
up her, isn't it?

1647
02:10:52,369 --> 02:10:53,336
Why are you asking me?
Ask everyone?

1648
02:10:54,037 --> 02:10:55,163
Don't get tensed up!

1649
02:11:02,546 --> 02:11:03,672
Sir, they're ready
for the Audition

1650
02:11:15,225 --> 02:11:18,194
Didn't we release a new CD in
Singapore? -The sale is excellent

1651
02:11:18,395 --> 02:11:19,020
Is it so Sir!

1652
02:11:21,398 --> 02:11:22,023
Very nice Sir!

1653
02:11:24,568 --> 02:11:26,035
Are they still tuning?

1654
02:11:26,403 --> 02:11:27,370
...Orelse, is this their Music?

1655
02:11:28,405 --> 02:11:31,533
Now in the name of Music
They're creating different new sounds

1656
02:11:31,742 --> 02:11:32,709
- Don't we know about it?

1657
02:11:35,746 --> 02:11:38,374
...That lady singer...
has not yet come!

1658
02:11:39,249 --> 02:11:41,046
...She'll come...
She'll come right now!

1659
02:11:43,420 --> 02:11:46,719
Just 5 minutes Sir
- I can't wait for these jokers!

1660
02:11:46,923 --> 02:11:47,389
She'll come now...

1661
02:11:47,591 --> 02:11:49,559
What were you doing?
Isn't it your duty to check it?

1662
02:11:57,934 --> 02:11:59,561
...Can't you plan a
simple programme?

1663
02:12:00,437 --> 02:12:02,564
Hey! You don't have
to come up in life!

1664
02:12:03,106 --> 02:12:05,404
Why are you spoiling
my life?

1665
02:12:06,443 --> 02:12:08,411
...Go and roam on the streets side!

1666
02:12:13,116 --> 02:12:15,584
Gone! These type of rich girls
are like this only!

1667
02:12:17,287 --> 02:12:19,755
They'll smile when required & throw
us once they find we're not required

1668
02:12:20,457 --> 02:12:21,082
Cheaters!

1669
02:12:22,125 --> 02:12:23,922
Hey! Why are you talking filthy?

1670
02:12:24,294 --> 02:12:27,092
Since, When you've started
finding our talk filthy?

1671
02:12:27,798 --> 02:12:29,595
Have you become reformed after
roaming around with her?

1672
02:12:29,800 --> 02:12:30,266
Don't be in a haste!

1673
02:12:30,467 --> 02:12:33,436
Hey! Why are you changing yourself
On seeing a girl? Yuck! Come!

1674
02:12:42,979 --> 02:12:44,105
Don't go Priya! Don't go...

1675
02:12:44,981 --> 02:12:47,609
Why are you going away
from me?

1676
02:12:47,818 --> 02:12:49,786
Will you go away like this
If your Mother had been alive?

1677
02:12:49,986 --> 02:12:52,955
What do you want? I'll build a
Church in this place

1678
02:12:53,156 --> 02:12:54,623
Do you want me to convert
into a Orphanage?

1679
02:12:54,825 --> 02:12:57,293
I'll do anything! What am I
Going to do without you?

1680
02:12:58,495 --> 02:13:00,463
Jesus, Why are you testing
me like this?

1681
02:13:03,500 --> 02:13:10,303
Mother... Mother...

1682
02:13:14,678 --> 02:13:15,975
Don't cry my child? Don't cry...

1683
02:13:39,035 --> 02:13:40,002
Thank you Sagayam!

1684
02:13:42,372 --> 02:13:43,339
...Thanks for everything!

1685
02:13:51,715 --> 02:13:52,682
Look after father!

1686
02:14:58,782 --> 02:15:00,909
Are you going? Are you going
off to do Social work?

1687
02:15:01,451 --> 02:15:03,078
You could've come and sang
only once for us!

1688
02:15:04,788 --> 02:15:07,416
God is only important, that God only
has gifted this voice, isn't it?

1689
02:15:07,791 --> 02:15:09,258
With that Voice you're...
to somebody...

1690
02:15:11,294 --> 02:15:12,090
Poor soul Guru!

1691
02:15:13,630 --> 02:15:15,928
Not for us, You could've
atleast sung for Guru, isn't it?

1692
02:15:16,299 --> 02:15:17,425
How much belief he
had on you?

1693
02:15:17,801 --> 02:15:19,098
Then, I am the deceiver!

1694
02:15:19,469 --> 02:15:21,596
I am a bad girl! I had
deceived everyone isn't it?

1695
02:15:25,308 --> 02:15:27,435
A doll which you got
to play with!

1696
02:15:28,812 --> 02:15:31,110
If you give key, I must
clap hands... dance!

1697
02:15:31,648 --> 02:15:32,774
Don't talk like that madam?

1698
02:15:35,151 --> 02:15:35,947
Don't call me as madam?

1699
02:15:36,486 --> 02:15:38,613
Madam, I did all this for
your well being only!

1700
02:15:39,155 --> 02:15:40,622
Only Thomas is the best
match for you

1701
02:15:40,991 --> 02:15:42,618
Who are you to decide about
My good and bad?

1702
02:15:42,993 --> 02:15:43,960
...Or who's that Thomas?

1703
02:15:44,494 --> 02:15:46,291
None of you can't understand
A Woman's heart!

1704
02:15:47,497 --> 02:15:48,794
I thought you
know everything!

1705
02:15:49,666 --> 02:15:50,792
Do you know what
you had achieved?

1706
02:15:51,501 --> 02:15:54,129
You made me to laugh
You made me to feel shy

1707
02:15:55,005 --> 02:15:56,472
...You made me to realise
my Womanhood!

1708
02:15:57,674 --> 02:15:58,971
...And made me to dream
for the first time!

1709
02:16:00,844 --> 02:16:02,141
I give my heart to you!

1710
02:16:08,351 --> 02:16:11,809
...But, Deva, you came off leaving
behind everything, isn't it?

1711
02:16:13,356 --> 02:16:15,824
A Guitar to a friend! A recording
chance for another friend

1712
02:16:16,359 --> 02:16:18,327
But, Did you ever think
about yourself?

1713
02:16:19,362 --> 02:16:20,329
...About myself?

1714
02:16:22,198 --> 02:16:25,167
I'll always treat all my
customers as Queens!

1715
02:16:27,704 --> 02:16:30,673
I'll think they're the most
important in this world!

1716
02:16:31,708 --> 02:16:32,675
...l'll forget about myself

1717
02:16:33,877 --> 02:16:35,174
...Everything is a dream madam!

1718
02:16:35,879 --> 02:16:39,178
...They'll wake up me from dream and
pay Rs.50 as tips and go away

1719
02:16:41,051 --> 02:16:43,679
Even, if I see them again
I shouldn't recognise them!

1720
02:16:45,055 --> 02:16:45,680
I shouldn't smile to them!

1721
02:16:48,058 --> 02:16:49,355
I've learnt to live without
falling in Love!

1722
02:16:53,063 --> 02:16:53,859
...They've taught me, madam!

1723
02:16:57,901 --> 02:16:59,368
Then, am I also one
of your customers?

1724
02:17:01,738 --> 02:17:02,864
I had only misunderstood it!

1725
02:17:04,741 --> 02:17:07,710
You not only changed my hairstyle
...but my life style itself

1726
02:17:09,746 --> 02:17:10,872
You've broken my heart!

1727
02:17:12,248 --> 02:17:13,215
Deva, it's paining!

1728
02:17:15,085 --> 02:17:15,710
It's paining!

1729
02:17:20,924 --> 02:17:24,382
Your work is over, isn't it
Why are you still here?

1730
02:17:31,434 --> 02:17:33,402
Take it... take this...
your Rs.50 tip!

1731
02:17:34,437 --> 02:17:35,404
Take it... Go away!

1732
02:17:50,787 --> 02:17:52,414
It seems he has
severe head injuries

1733
02:17:52,956 --> 02:17:54,753
Back bone, hands &
legs have fractures

1734
02:17:55,291 --> 02:17:57,088
Doctor says his survival
chances are thin!

1735
02:17:57,794 --> 02:18:01,594
Even if he survives, it seems He'll
not be able to move like earlier

1736
02:18:02,298 --> 02:18:02,764
Madman!

1737
02:18:04,134 --> 02:18:05,601
Why should he hang outside
a running train?

1738
02:18:05,969 --> 02:18:06,765
Is he a Hero?

1739
02:18:07,637 --> 02:18:09,605
What can he do?
He loved Priya

1740
02:18:10,473 --> 02:18:11,599
...Why sssh?

1741
02:18:12,142 --> 02:18:12,938
Thomas is here only!

1742
02:18:17,480 --> 02:18:20,779
Sir, I had a small
doubt earlier itself!

1743
02:18:22,318 --> 02:18:23,114
I should've told you

1744
02:18:23,653 --> 02:18:26,781
But, in my desire of becoming
a famous musician!

1745
02:18:29,993 --> 02:18:30,288
...Me...

1746
02:18:49,679 --> 02:18:53,479
Die man... die man...

1747
02:19:03,693 --> 02:19:05,320
You know how much
I Love her, isn't it?

1748
02:19:06,863 --> 02:19:07,989
Couldn't you find another girl?

1749
02:19:13,870 --> 02:19:14,996
What do you know
about Love?

1750
02:19:18,041 --> 02:19:20,509
Can you keep her happy?
...Can you

1751
02:19:22,879 --> 02:19:23,345
you can't!

1752
02:19:25,215 --> 02:19:26,011
What's your education?

1753
02:19:27,217 --> 02:19:29,185
What will you talk
with her? About hair?

1754
02:19:36,059 --> 02:19:37,185
One drop of tear...

1755
02:19:37,894 --> 02:19:40,192
Even if one drop of tear comes
out of her, I won't leave you

1756
02:19:46,402 --> 02:19:47,869
What do you've, that, which
I don't have?

1757
02:19:50,573 --> 02:19:51,198
How could it?

1758
02:19:54,577 --> 02:19:56,204
You could've told me about this
earlier itself, isn't it?

1759
02:19:57,914 --> 02:19:59,541
I would'nt have got deceived for
so many days?

1760
02:20:07,924 --> 02:20:08,549
How will you tell it?

1761
02:20:12,762 --> 02:20:13,888
It's all my fate?

1762
02:20:18,768 --> 02:20:21,066
This is uniform for you to
get trained as a Nun!

1763
02:20:22,438 --> 02:20:25,236
Apart from Jesus and prayer
there shouldn't be anything in your mind!

1764
02:20:26,943 --> 02:20:29,571
If you've any doubts
consult me!

1765
02:20:30,613 --> 02:20:32,240
Let Jesus show you
the right path!

1766
02:20:34,784 --> 02:20:37,753
Jesus! Somehow please
save Deva

1767
02:20:38,788 --> 02:20:39,914
Please give back
Deva's life!

1768
02:20:41,457 --> 02:20:44,255
...ln return for his life
I'll sacrifice my life!

1769
02:20:45,795 --> 02:20:46,762
...l'll sacrifice my life!

1770
02:20:51,968 --> 02:20:54,937
These are three things that a
Nun should follow in her life

1771
02:20:55,305 --> 02:20:57,273
She must have self-control!

1772
02:20:57,807 --> 02:20:58,933
. She shouldn't allow the thoughts to be shattered

1773
02:22:21,057 --> 02:22:23,025
Deva! Are you okay?

1774
02:22:35,905 --> 02:22:37,873
A letter has come from Priya
She has enquired about you!

1775
02:22:47,583 --> 02:22:49,551
Tomorrow only Priya is going
to become a Nun isn't it?

1776
02:22:52,088 --> 02:22:52,713
Shall we go?

1777
02:22:54,757 --> 02:22:55,382
I am not interested Sir!

1778
02:22:56,259 --> 02:22:57,886
Lt'll be grand
like a marriage

1779
02:22:59,095 --> 02:23:01,393
Those who are going to become
a Nun will take an Oath with the Bishop!

1780
02:23:03,099 --> 02:23:05,567
Once they give an Oath...
- they can't take it back!

1781
02:23:06,269 --> 02:23:09,238
Before that we can go...
Meet her, can talk... if we wish

1782
02:23:10,606 --> 02:23:12,403
No Sir... No Sir!

1783
02:23:12,775 --> 02:23:15,403
You too said something
isn't it?

1784
02:23:17,780 --> 02:23:18,747
...When she becomes a Nun...

1785
02:23:20,116 --> 02:23:21,413
You had joked that
You'll give her a haircut

1786
02:23:21,784 --> 02:23:25,413
...That's... For joke... because
She sang with us for few days...

1787
02:23:25,788 --> 02:23:27,756
Oh! For joke?

1788
02:23:28,624 --> 02:23:30,421
What she had sung?

1789
02:23:31,127 --> 02:23:34,585
Guru's tune was very nice
That's why, ordinary voice also sounded great...

1790
02:23:35,798 --> 02:23:37,425
Okay, Now, why should we
talk about her?

1791
02:23:41,804 --> 02:23:42,600
She is a fraud isn't it?

1792
02:23:43,806 --> 02:23:44,431
I don't know, Sir!

1793
02:23:45,475 --> 02:23:46,942
You know very well about
a Woman's heart, isn't it?

1794
02:23:48,978 --> 02:23:49,945
Couldn't you find out her heart?

1795
02:23:52,815 --> 02:23:54,112
Whether you know or not
But, I know it

1796
02:23:54,484 --> 02:23:55,951
She's a big fraud
Everything was a drama

1797
02:23:56,819 --> 02:23:58,616
Deceive man and make them mad

1798
02:23:59,822 --> 02:24:03,280
Look even in that they
have a happiness

1799
02:24:05,661 --> 02:24:06,958
Now she's going to
deceive God...

1800
02:24:09,499 --> 02:24:11,626
Don't talk like this about her
She's not like that...

1801
02:24:13,503 --> 02:24:14,800
You didn't get her...
I too didn't get her...

1802
02:24:17,173 --> 02:24:18,140
You don't know one thing...

1803
02:24:26,182 --> 02:24:27,809
I still love her... love her...

1804
02:24:31,020 --> 02:24:33,989
Deva, I know...
I know...

1805
02:24:36,192 --> 02:24:38,319
Till now, I was waiting
to hear this from you

1806
02:25:18,234 --> 02:25:26,699
Today 12 sisters are going to
dedicate their lives to the Lord & Church

1807
02:25:26,909 --> 02:25:28,706
Now, those sisters...

1808
02:25:31,581 --> 02:25:37,213
Will promise to keep up Chastity
Obedience & Simplicity

1809
02:25:41,591 --> 02:25:45,049
On behalf of Mother superior
Therasa Jebamony of the Church-

1810
02:25:45,428 --> 02:25:54,234
I, Sister Agnes, promise you to keep up
Chastity, Obedience & Simplicity

1811
02:25:55,104 --> 02:26:00,736
I accept your promise in
the name of the Church

1812
02:26:32,475 --> 02:26:37,105
Sisters who've prepared
themselves to become Nuns-

1813
02:26:38,147 --> 02:26:40,775
They are accepted as
Spinsters

1814
02:27:08,344 --> 02:27:09,140
Thomas stop...

1815
02:27:09,345 --> 02:27:09,970
It should not happen

1816
02:27:10,179 --> 02:27:10,645
Thomas, stop...

1817
02:27:12,348 --> 02:27:13,975
You shouldn't go inside
- it shouldn't happen

1818
02:27:17,520 --> 02:27:18,817
I can understand your feelings

1819
02:27:19,021 --> 02:27:20,818
But, we can't get all
that we desire

1820
02:27:21,190 --> 02:27:22,657
Oh God! She didn't love me...

1821
02:27:24,360 --> 02:27:25,156
This is not for me...

1822
02:27:27,697 --> 02:27:28,493
For someone else...

1823
02:27:30,700 --> 02:27:32,998
Thomas, no... it should happen
only like this...

1824
02:27:33,369 --> 02:27:34,165
This is God's wish...

1825
02:27:34,370 --> 02:27:36,838
This is untrue, you've surmised
wrongly

1826
02:27:37,206 --> 02:27:38,332
You're trying to deceive God

1827
02:27:39,041 --> 02:27:40,668
Do you think God doesn't
know your feelings?

1828
02:27:40,876 --> 02:27:43,504
I always wished to be
a Nun

1829
02:27:43,879 --> 02:27:45,346
...lt was at that time...

1830
02:27:46,048 --> 02:27:48,016
Just because God saved
Deva from Death

1831
02:27:48,384 --> 02:27:49,681
You're ready to sacrifice
your life...

1832
02:27:49,885 --> 02:27:51,682
This matter is between
God & me

1833
02:27:52,388 --> 02:27:54,015
He has fulfilled my Prayer

1834
02:27:54,390 --> 02:27:56,688
Now, shouldn't I fulfill
My promise to him

1835
02:27:58,227 --> 02:27:59,854
You shouldn't do business
with Jesus...

1836
02:28:00,563 --> 02:28:03,031
You should Pray only for
his mercy

1837
02:28:03,265 --> 02:28:05,358
We should accept everything
given by him

1838
02:28:06,235 --> 02:28:07,532
That is the true devotion...

1839
02:28:07,737 --> 02:28:09,864
Priya tell me... Do you love
anyone?

1840
02:28:10,239 --> 02:28:11,206
Priya, tell me... tell...

1841
02:28:14,910 --> 02:28:15,535
...Tell me...

1842
02:28:16,912 --> 02:28:19,710
God only created fire, but he
never said us to touch it

1843
02:28:20,416 --> 02:28:21,383
We should realise that...

1844
02:28:23,085 --> 02:28:26,054
God only created Man & woman and
the same God only created 'Love' also

1845
02:28:28,257 --> 02:28:29,053
Why should he create me?

1846
02:28:29,925 --> 02:28:31,222
Why did he made us to
meet each other?

1847
02:28:32,428 --> 02:28:33,395
Why should I?

1848
02:28:35,431 --> 02:28:36,728
Why did I make Deva to
interfere in this?

1849
02:28:36,932 --> 02:28:39,059
Why should you love Deva?
And why I should be here?

1850
02:28:40,436 --> 02:28:42,063
This is not my or your question

1851
02:28:45,107 --> 02:28:47,234
Priya tell me... tell me the Truth

1852
02:28:49,111 --> 02:28:49,577
...Tell me...

1853
02:28:50,112 --> 02:28:51,238
Priya, tell...

1854
02:28:58,120 --> 02:29:00,088
...Tell...
- Yes... yes...

1855
02:29:08,464 --> 02:29:12,924
Priya you marry! Go and marry

1856
02:29:17,406 --> 02:29:20,603
Till now, I hesistated so much
to talk to her! Now, how could I?

1857
02:29:22,144 --> 02:29:23,270
From where did I get
that power?

1858
02:30:00,349 --> 02:30:01,475
After few years...

1859
02:30:02,017 --> 02:30:07,978
Many girls, more Beautiful, Rich
and Intelligent than Priya

1860
02:30:08,257 --> 02:30:10,657
...Lost their nights with the
thoughts of Thomas

1861
02:30:11,026 --> 02:30:12,152
...Their dreams got shattered

1862
02:30:12,795 --> 02:30:13,159
...But...

1863
02:30:13,796 --> 02:30:15,661
...The search for Love of
Thomas didn't stop

1864
02:30:17,032 --> 02:30:18,499
Atlast, he found out where
his love was

1865
02:30:19,034 --> 02:30:21,832
...He dedicated himself into
the service of God

1866
02:30:41,891 --> 02:30:44,018
The intelligence of Rev. Father
Thomas Thangadurai

1867
02:30:44,760 --> 02:30:48,025
...His knowledge of Bible
Conducting the Church...

1868
02:30:48,397 --> 02:30:51,195
...He has every quality
to become a Bishop

1869
02:30:51,567 --> 02:30:53,194
...So the talk goes around
the Church

1870
02:30:58,073 --> 02:31:02,203
He had only Baptised
Deva & Priya's child

1871
02:31:02,578 --> 02:31:03,704
Her name is Nisha

1872
02:31:04,914 --> 02:31:06,040
Say bye to uncle

1873
02:31:24,600 --> 02:31:27,899
James Thangadurai's desire of building
a bridge became a day dream

1874
02:31:28,804 --> 02:31:32,399
The money he saved by Pennywise
is now shelling it out in Pounds

1875
02:31:35,778 --> 02:31:38,747
Mr. Amalraj even now calls
friends to home

1876
02:31:39,448 --> 02:31:42,576
...He serves tea and boasts
about Grandfather's car

1877
02:31:51,794 --> 02:31:55,423
The young hearts were drooling
hearing this voice

1878
02:31:55,965 --> 02:31:59,264
The critics are saying that
after P. Susheela, its Priya Deva

1879
02:31:59,635 --> 02:32:01,603
If she hadn't came into
Music field

1880
02:32:01,971 --> 02:32:05,429
If would've been a big loss to
Music world, so says Subbudu

1881
02:32:11,580 --> 02:32:13,104
Guru has become a
Music Director in Cinema

1882
02:32:13,649 --> 02:32:15,116
...He has 4 films on hand

1883
02:32:15,718 --> 02:32:19,779
There are 4 cases also in Court
for copying A.R. Rehman's tunes

1884
02:32:26,829 --> 02:32:29,127
Mechanic Raja is now owner
of a Petrol Station

1885
02:32:29,932 --> 02:32:32,628
He has all the qualities
of a Neo Rich

1886
02:32:33,168 --> 02:32:34,465
Even in hot climate
he'll wear a coat

1887
02:32:35,004 --> 02:32:37,472
...He takes the Cell phone even
