1
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,915
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,832
We sure get a genteel clientele
with these charity shindigs.

3
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,433
Especially the dames.

4
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,909
What class. What refinement.

5
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,992
What cultured tomatoes.

6
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,470
Get a load of that one.

7
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,559
Yoo-hoo.

8
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,995
Boys.

9
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,710
In polite society, we don't say "yoo-hoo."
We say "yoo-whom."

10
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,193
- Nick, hi.
- Hi.

11
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,554
You remember Mrs. Charles.

12
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,789
Hi.

13
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,757
You took the words right out of my mouth.

14
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,515
What are you doing at this clambake?
You ain't detectiving, are you?

15
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,553
Mrs. Charles thinks we should cultivate
some people who haven't served time.

16
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,677
She wants to create a proper atmosphere
for Nicky Jr.

17
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,716
Junior? How is the little squirt?

18
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,313
The little squirt is fine.

19
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,549
Thanks to your teaching...

20
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,995
he can crack any safe in town now
in 15 minutes.

21
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,911
Thirty-one and black.

22
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,113
Thirty-one and black. Mama, that's us.

23
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,993
You shouldn't talk that way to my friends.
They're sensitive.

24
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,911
I didn't mean to hurt them. I love them.

25
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,310
They're perfect gentlemen,
right down to their fingerprints.

26
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,393
I've got a great idea.

27
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,993
- What is it?
- Let's go home.

28
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,354
What's at home?

29
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,677
- You, my pipe, my slippers.
- I think you're slipping.

30
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,036
Darling, give me my pipe, my slippers
and a beautiful woman...

31
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,432
- and you can have my pipe and slippers.
- That's sweet. But we're staying here.

32
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,311
Ladies and gentlemen,
Buddy Hollis and his famous clarinet.

33
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,840
That reedman
is really whacked up tonight.

34
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,078
You'd be sporting a whack-job, too...

35
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,516
if you were carrying a torch like him
for that little cookie.

36
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,313
Take over, Maxie.

37
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,990
What's wrong?
Boat rocking too much for you?

38
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,231
Or is the reedman's condition
a little too tough to take?

39
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,670
The sensational Buddy Hollis.

40
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,638
Sounded more like a kid with a kazoo.
And his own tune, too.

41
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,631
It's bad enough
getting on the jumping juice...

42
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,676
disappearing for days,
forgetting where he's been.

43
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,876
He doesn't know where he is
when he gets back.

44
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,712
If you ask me, the guy has blown his top.

45
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,872
What do you expect
after the pushing around we gave him?

46
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,520
Maybe you'd like
to patch things up with him.

47
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,792
Wouldn't that be convenient for you and
the dames you've been chasing around?

48
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,479
You've been peeking.

49
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,639
I must have blown my top...

50
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,792
kicking Buddy over
for a road-company Casanova like you.

51
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,713
There you are.
Bandstand too crowded for you?

52
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,836
Maybe you'd like me
to bring the boys out here.

53
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,239
Sorry, bossman.

54
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,709
You mind taking the girlfriend with you?

55
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,594
Ex-girlfriend.

56
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,428
Brings sunshine into everyone's life,
doesn't he?

57
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,398
Stay out in that sunshine long enough,
you get a third-degree burn.

58
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,189
Where are you going?

59
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,795
I can't stand that oily kisser of yours
too long without another drink.

60
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,154
- Sit down.
- What do you mean?

61
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,593
I said, sit down.

62
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,828
Boys, you'd better get on there.
Hurry up. Come on.

63
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,592
Buddy, darling.

64
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,270
Get him up. He's not hurt.
Get him out of here. He's all right.

65
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,153
You didn't have to hit him.

66
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,800
I should have let him
crease my scalp with that clarinet.

67
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,791
He's beat. He couldn't lift it that high.

68
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,791
- What did you expect me to do?
- Just what you did.

69
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,871
- He's through. Get him out.
- Wait a minute.

70
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,757
I don't want any part of him. Get him out.

71
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,989
What goes on here?

72
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,991
Trying to turn this boat
into a fishing barge?

73
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,513
Relax. The band is my business.

74
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,079
On this boat, it's my business.

75
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,434
If that's the way you want it...

76
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,829
when I finish here tonight,
we'll wash up for good.

77
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,478
I don't like fast shuffles, Tommy.

78
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,630
Here's a card right off the top of the deck:

79
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,995
Mitch Talbin's booked a tour
of dance halls for me.

80
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,595
I can make more money with him
in 30 weeks than with you in 30 years.

81
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,399
You see,
your publicity man did a good job on me.

82
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,475
That awful smell around here
must be your gratitude.

83
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,709
"Gratitude"?

84
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,471
Remind me to look that word up.

85
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,118
- I'll be in your office later for my dough.
- "Dough"?

86
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,276
Remind me to look that word up.

87
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,438
I need that money. The bookies
are putting the squeeze on me.

88
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,318
If I'm left holding the bag,
I'll hold everything that's in it.

89
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,630
Remember, nothing foolish.

90
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,788
There he is.

91
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,389
Get him.

92
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,833
What's all the fuss, Al?

93
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,957
- Heard you were going on tour.
- Yeah, first stop, Miami.

94
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,156
I've got a lot of friends in Miami.

95
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,670
Want me to have them look you up?

96
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,350
I intended to pay you before I left town.

97
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,238
No hurry. We'll be around till closing.

98
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,358
If Mitch Talbin were here,
I'd pay you what I owe you right now.

99
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,238
- I just signed up with him.
- There's Mitch Talbin.

100
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,708
Mitch?

101
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,234
Hello, Tommy. You know Tommy Drake.

102
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,949
- I feel as though I know him intimately.
- Yeah, Baby's quite a fan of yours.

103
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,555
- How we doing, kid?
- I finally had it out with Brant.

104
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,675
Everything okay?

105
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,830
Yeah. It's all set, except that...

106
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,670
- I gotta have some money.
- Sure. Anything you want.

107
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,432
I need $12,000.

108
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,195
$12,000? That's a lot of money.

109
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,589
My luck's been a little sour lately,
Mitch, but...

110
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,148
I'm good for it.
I'll sign my tour money over to you.

111
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,949
I know, but trains get wrecked,
planes crash, you might drop dead.

112
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,559
I gotta think that over.

113
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,712
You'd better think fast.
I gotta have it before closing.

114
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,316
I can think faster after I've had a drink.
Come on, let's sit down.

115
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,391
- But this is important.
- Come on.

116
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,115
Do you want to eat or do you want a drink
or do you want to dance?

117
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,429
I'm sure you wouldn't want to lose this.

118
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,111
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

119
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,317
- Thank you very much.
- You're very welcome.

120
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,434
It's a beautiful thing. The necklace.

121
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,915
- Mr. Charles. Nora.
- Hello.

122
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,638
We've been looking all over for you.

123
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,551
- You know Mr. Thayar, of course.
- Yes.

124
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,232
We saved a place for you at our table.

125
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,912
It's at the other end of the room.

126
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,797
We're table hopping. Excuse us.

127
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,359
- Yes.
- Good-bye.

128
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,475
Good-bye.

129
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,637
- Who are they?
- Just the people who invited us.

130
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,790
- You ought to remember the Thayars.
- I ought?

131
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,838
He presented the museum
with a million dollars worth of antiques.

132
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,275
- He did?
- Yes. They're very nice.

133
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,278
He seems especially nice
for a guy carrying a gun.

134
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,635
A gun?

135
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,593
Yes. I felt it just now
when we locked bumpers.

136
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,470
If this rampage of respectability persists,
we'll have to get you a bullet-proof girdle.

137
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,672
If you people think a gambler like Brant...

138
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,718
is going to turn the entire
evening's proceeds over to charity...

139
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,153
you're being very naive.

140
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,196
- Well, he is.
- Janet arranged it.

141
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,236
I don't know how
she ever persuaded him to.

142
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,788
- That doesn't take much imagination.
- Hello, Mr. Brant.

143
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,598
- You know everybody.
- How do you do?

144
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,353
We were just remarking
about your generosity.

145
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,952
- I'm getting my cut.
- I thought so.

146
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,792
A dance with your daughter.

147
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,317
- May I have that dance now?
- Janet has just finished dancing.

148
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,709
- I'm sure she's tired.
- I'd love to dance.

149
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,392
- Janet.
- David, please.

150
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,114
Maybe, we'd better make this
some other time.

151
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,720
Father, if you'll consult
my birth certificate...

152
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,952
you'll find I'm of full age and perfectly
capable of making my own decisions.

153
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,870
- Phil.
- Darling.

154
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,229
I don't think
the blue-blooded Mr. Thayar will like...

155
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,880
the idea of his daughter
being married to a guy like me.

156
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,554
Tomorrow, there won't be anything
he can do about it.

157
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,871
You're sure you want
to go through with it? Maybe, no dice.

158
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,797
It's going to be a natural.

159
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,229
I'll go to my office,
get my things, and some money.

160
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,754
Meet me at the companionway
in 10 minutes.

161
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,873
Rain again.

162
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,671
Thank you, Bertha.
Tell Mr. Charles his breakfast is ready.

163
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,873
Cornflakes before comics.

164
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,030
- But, Mom.
- After breakfast, Nicky.

165
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,638
- Morning, Son.
- Hi, Dad. You look keen.

166
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,032
Beautiful day. I've dressed for it.

167
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,317
<i>- You look like a page out of Esquire.
- Not the page I saw.</i>

168
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,829
I'm through.

169
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,078
Oh, boy! Another murder.

170
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,593
How do you like that?

171
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,238
- It's a trap.
- What?

172
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,754
I knew Roy shouldn't have trusted
that Arsenic Annie.

173
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,956
She's a man dressed in a woman's clothes.

174
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,554
- Annie's a man?
- Sure. It's a dead giveaway.

175
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,952
A dame would never pass a mirror without
looking to see if her slip was showing.

176
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,075
"Dame"?

177
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,431
That's what Daddy always says.

178
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,759
I never say "dame."

179
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,833
I always say "doll." "Dish."

180
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,356
Anyway, it's a very shrewd deduction.

181
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,273
Don't throw the paper away.
I want to read about that murder.

182
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,873
Maybe we can figure it out.

183
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,713
- Asta.
- Father's no longer interested in murders.

184
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,632
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye?

185
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,029
Nicky, the piano is in the living room.

186
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,113
- But I gotta pitch today.
- Couldn't he practice later?

187
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,158
He's going to the Thayar's
this afternoon to meet their youngster.

188
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,869
They might ask him to play
and I want him to be at his best. Go on.

189
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,672
Asta, you stay out of this.

190
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,877
Come on, Asta.

191
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,038
- Come on.
- Nicky?

192
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,189
Come here.

193
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,111
You see why I'm worried?

194
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,717
He's been ducking his practicing all week.

195
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,758
I think you're going to have to have
a good spanking.

196
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,918
- Spanking?
- Spanking.

197
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,397
- Very well.
- No, I'm his mother. You're his father.

198
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,238
- I wouldn't have it any other way.
- Nick.

199
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,753
Come here, Son.

200
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,634
I regret that I am going to have
to take a certain corrective action.

201
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,396
I think this is the way they do it.

202
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,390
That was very clever of you, Nicky.

203
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,153
As a reward, you'll have no radio
for the rest of the week.

204
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,674
- But, Mom.
- Your mother is absolutely right.

205
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,079
Go to your room.

206
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,831
Did you know about this glove?

207
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,990
- Why, Nora.
- Pardon me, Mrs. Charles.

208
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,957
A Mr. And Mrs. Brant are here to see you.

209
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,268
Mr. And Mrs...

210
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,510
Janet Thayar. She did it.

211
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,956
She told me they were going to elope.
Come on.

212
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,395
The newlyweds.

213
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,277
- Congratulations.
- Hello, Mr. Charles.

214
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,191
- What a surprise.
- Mrs. Charles.

215
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,679
Congratulations, Mr. Brant.

216
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,399
If you go out and come back,
we can throw some rice at you.

217
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,994
We'd throw some old shoes, too,
but we're wearing them.

218
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,799
Please forgive us.
We just flew in from Atlantic City.

219
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,713
- When we read the newspapers...
- The secret's out?

220
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,075
- This calls for a celebration.
- A celebration?

221
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,835
Mr. Charles has been saving his last bottle
of Scotch for just such an occasion.

222
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,751
Nicky, where is that bottle?

223
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,597
It's in my red pajamas, in the left leg.

224
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,835
Sit down.

225
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,798
Bertha, let's have some ice and soda.
Never mind, we have some.

226
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,598
Hope you don't mind drinking this early.

227
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,912
I could use a drink. I'll be celebrating
being elected public enemy number one.

228
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,118
By the Thayars, you mean.

229
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,550
- You found it.
- It was in the right leg.

230
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,074
Mr. Charles,
I think you have this all wrong.

231
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,991
- Have you read the morning paper?
- No.

232
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,436
I haven't gotten to it yet.
But, I do know that...

233
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,439
Phil didn't do it.

234
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,632
I know many people heard him
threaten Drake. That made it look bad...

235
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,711
but he was just trying to scare him a little.

236
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,756
This is why we've come to ask your help.

237
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,637
Phil wouldn't shoot anybody.

238
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,073
I'm sorry.

239
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,436
I'd like to discuss this matter further,
but I'm afraid it'll have to be by telephone.

240
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,714
But, Nick.

241
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,475
Darling, Mr. Brant is wanted by the police.

242
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,516
Our having him here
without notifying them...

243
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,750
makes us accessories after the fact.

244
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,270
And I don't think you'd find
the prison gray very becoming.

245
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,190
I'm sorry we couldn't have a drink.
Perhaps, some other time.

246
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,397
- It's quite all right.
- I don't want to appear inhospitable.

247
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,436
Here, take the bottle with you.

248
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,598
I imagine that shot was meant for me.

249
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,274
- No.
- A fine way to kill a bottle.

250
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,396
- What goes on? What happened?
- Go to your room.

251
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,471
That's the murderer from the paper.

252
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,437
Hold on to him. I'll buzz the cops.

253
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,397
You buzz right back to your room.

254
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,674
What happened?

255
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,198
- Did you pick anyone up now?
- I haven't in the last 10 minutes.

256
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,474
Be right back.

257
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,679
Was anyone hurt?

258
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,798
Yes, an old friend of mine
went completely to pieces.

259
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,073
What was it?

260
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,232
- Some drunk rehearsing for the Fourth.
- In September?

261
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,194
He was drunk.

262
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,713
Did you discover anything?

263
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,917
Yes. Never entertain newlyweds
until you've read the morning papers.

264
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,076
There's the Charles' apartment.

265
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,678
Police. Duck in there.

266
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,832
Where is he? We got a flash that
there's a maniac running amuck here.

267
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,718
- What's that? Blood?
- I wish it were.

268
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,190
Mr. Charles and I were trying
to launch our little boy's battleship.

269
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,998
There is something wrong, ain't there?

270
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,719
I'm afraid our son's been listening
to too much radio.

271
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,234
- We get that all the time.
- Just a minute.

272
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,196
You'd be the fair-haired boys of the force...

273
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,952
if you could bring Phil Brant in, right?

274
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,634
- Phil Brant?
- A little surprise for you.

275
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,549
Come in.

276
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,079
Here you are.

277
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,150
Holy hollering cats. Phil Brant.

278
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,834
That's the sweetest double-cross
I've ever been handed.

279
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,638
The less you say, the better.

280
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,359
But he didn't shoot anybody.
Somebody even shot at him.

281
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,873
You're a witness, Mrs. Charles.

282
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,234
Hand-picked.

283
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,076
Mr. Brant may be able to fool some people
with that phony shooting gag...

284
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,833
but I've seen it pulled far too often
even to be amused.

285
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,717
Somebody did shoot at him.

286
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,594
By special arrangement
with Mr. Brant himself.

287
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,350
A quaint old maneuver to divert suspicion.

288
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,749
As they say in the movies,
"They went thataway."

289
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,070
You're right. It's an oldie. A very old oldie.

290
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,718
It's a lie and he knows it.

291
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,189
But he's the great Nick Charles,
The Mastermind.

292
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,191
We came over here asking your help...

293
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,635
and you've helped Phil
right into the electric chair.

294
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,597
Save it for your lawyer, lady.

295
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,558
Thank you, Mr. Charles. Thanks a lot.
Come on.

296
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,796
I could've sworn
that shot was on the level.

297
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,074
It was on the level.

298
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,196
- What? Then why did you...
- Darling.

299
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,910
With Brant loose, there'd be other shots.
One of them might hit the mark.

300
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,638
He'll be safer in jail.

301
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,950
- Then you don't think he killed Drake.
- Oh, that I don't know.

302
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,719
I suppose
jail is the best place temporarily.

303
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,390
But suppose he's innocent
and can't prove it?

304
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,550
Then it wouldn't be so temporary.

305
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,470
- The police do make mistakes.
- Yes, that is a cheerful thought.

306
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,312
Just what I've been thinking.

307
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,992
Of course, if you were on the case...

308
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,674
there would be no mistake.

309
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,032
It's positively sadistic
the way you drive me to work.

310
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,678
- All right, Mrs. Legree.
- My Nicky.

311
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,514
But for the time being,
we'll work without the police.

312
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,556
Nothing new. Get going.

313
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,039
- Hey, Mack. How about it?
- Sorry.

314
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,998
We got your photos this afternoon
with the rest of the news fellas.

315
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,913
Nobody gets on or off that boat
without a pass from the inspector.

316
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,150
You decided what kind of gun
Drake was shot with?

317
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,596
Ballistics is a little bit puzzled
but they'll figure it out.

318
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,839
- Hey, you, got a pass?
- A pass?

319
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,557
Since when does a peaceful citizen need
a pass to stroll along the waterfront?

320
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,598
<i>There'll be a letter in the Morning Times
about this.</i>

321
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,233
What's the matter now, Callahan?

322
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,514
Patrolman Davis is hungry again.
Got to get him a couple of sandwiches.

323
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,996
Sitting out on that deck
kind of gave me an appetite, too.

324
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,389
What'll it be?

325
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,916
Chowder and be sure it's hot.
My rheumatism's killing me.

326
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,399
Cold out there tonight?

327
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,675
Naturally. Whenever there's a job...

328
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,797
involving some slight inconvenience,
such as risking pneumonia...

329
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,711
Michael Callahan gets it.

330
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,869
And a couple of hams on white to go out.

331
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,031
No piccalilli this time.

332
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,037
No piccalilli. What's yours?

333
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,036
A couple of hams on white to go out.
No piccalilli.

334
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,553
Thirty cents.

335
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,510
Sandy, I wish your chowder
was as thick as the fog.

336
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,478
Hey, you.

337
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,994
- Get out of the boat.
- Who are you?

338
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,310
Get out of my boat. That's who I am.

339
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,676
How'd you like
to make yourself a quick $5?

340
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,988
Get into the boat.

341
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,310
I just want you to row me out
to that gambling ship.

342
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,913
Get out of the boat.

343
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,511
- $25.
- Get into the boat.

344
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,070
For $25, I'll give you the boat.

345
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,469
Who's there?

346
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,471
I can't see my eyes before me.

347
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,237
It's Captain Kidd.
Can't you see the rings in my ears?

348
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,152
It's you, Callahan.

349
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,517
Did that come out of you, Callahan?

350
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,114
You'll be answering questions
instead of asking them...

351
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,112
if you can't explain what the anchor's
doing up out of the water.

352
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,633
Anchor? Out of the water?

353
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,597
I'll see about it right away.

354
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,754
Lay off there a ways till I call you.

355
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,433
Callahan, that ain't an anchor
out of the water.

356
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,273
It's a dinghy.
How did that dinghy get there?

357
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,269
Not very neat of the inspector, was it?

358
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,032
What's the excitement, boy?

359
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,438
It's just a razorblade.

360
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,989
Oh, no.

361
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,355
It couldn't have been Somerset Maugham.

362
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,115
Who's that?

363
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,033
It's me, bright eyes.
Who were you expecting? Admiral Halsey?

364
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,634
- What are you doing down there?
- Walking up.

365
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,711
You know any other way of getting
on this ship?

366
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,472
Here are your sandwiches.

367
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,716
Where did you get that?

368
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,999
- You brought it.
- How? By mental telepathy?

369
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,198
You put it on the box when you told me
to go look at the anchor.

370
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,397
- What anchor?
- The anchor that...

371
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,159
Look, Callahan,
you're past the retiring age.

372
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,231
Why don't you put in for your pension?

373
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,198
If you're insinuating
that I gave you that sandwich...

374
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,317
Well, who did?
Captain Kidd with the rings in his ears?

375
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,629
Callahan, if you didn't bring me
this sandwich...

376
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,555
then we've got uninvited guests.

377
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,309
What is it? Smell something interesting?

378
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,634
The maestro.

379
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,589
"A reminder that I love you. Fran."

380
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,392
"Unfaithfully, Joan."

381
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,277
"To Tommy, you dog,
but I can't help it. Alice."

382
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,629
Quiet, Asta.

383
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,550
<i>"Under the Stars, introduced by
Tommy Drake and Orchestra.</i>

384
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,633
"Piccolo's part."

385
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,592
The fine itchy-fingered hand of Mr. Amboy.

386
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,711
I'll take that piece of music.

387
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,873
If you're afraid of my bursting into song,
it'd be a bit difficult with the piccolo part.

388
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,713
- I said, I'd take that piece of music.
- Go easy with that knife.

389
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,031
Just one word from me
and that dog will tear you to pieces.

390
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,791
- Give me it before I let air in your kidneys.
- Wait. You win.

391
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,316
I'm afraid these old kidneys
wouldn't take a very good vulcanizing job.

392
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,231
There you are. Get it, Asta.

393
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,709
Drop it.

394
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,029
Come here.

395
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,149
Stop!

396
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,752
Get a hold of him.

397
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,831
- There he is.
- All right, you!

398
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,998
- That explains the dinghy.
- I'll report it to shore.

399
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,709
Asta?

400
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,273
Serenade to a heel.

401
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,478
Alias Tommy Drake.

402
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,233
Do you always feel so light-hearted
about murder?

403
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,908
With Drake, that bullet
was an improvement.

404
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,911
- Solid.
- Who are you?

405
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,238
My name is Nick Charles.

406
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,799
- Cop?
- Cop.

407
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,590
We got a pass from the inspector.
We had to get our instruments.

408
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,076
Let's go fellows. We're packing.

409
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,836
The Constitution says a gate's got a right
to earn a livelihood.

410
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,434
Well, we ain't so lively without our tools.

411
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,352
Do you know anyone besides Brant...

412
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,715
who might have been interested
in knocking Drake off?

413
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,598
Try the phone book. You may find
a couple names on every page.

414
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,829
Solid.

415
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,628
Wait a minute. He was shot, remember?

416
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,868
What were you doing in Brant's office
last night?

417
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,032
- Me in Brant's office?
- You dropped one of those blades.

418
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,153
Hold the phone.

419
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,835
Every man who uses a reed, uses a blade.

420
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,638
I ain't the only reedman in the band.

421
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,632
That whacked-up Buddy Hollis
was in Brant's office last night.

422
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,915
He was just trying to get his job back.

423
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,035
Did Brant fire him?

424
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,156
Drake fired him.
They had a battle over a dame.

425
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,755
- He ain't gonna kill anybody over a dame.
- Well, he was in there.

426
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,996
Where can I find this
whacked-up character?

427
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,038
He's been bouncing around
from place to place lately.

428
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,668
You'll probably dig him
in one of the jam joints.

429
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,034
Come again?

430
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,750
Dig him in one of the jam joints.

431
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,279
Where the boys go after closing
and really ride.

432
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,151
Just for cats and intellectuals.

433
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,033
Rooty-toots and bobbysoxers verboten.

434
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,155
Solid.

435
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,833
I don't wear bobby socks,
but would you say I was a "rooty-toot"?

436
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,752
Strictly.

437
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,030
But, I guess I can ace you in.

438
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,432
Considering the resemblance between
this blade and the one in Brant's office...

439
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,593
I think you'd better.

440
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,478
- Shall we go?
- Go?

441
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,232
The dust don't start rising
till deuce-a-bells.

442
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,355
Come again?

443
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,000
He means those jams don't get started
till around 2:00.

444
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,992
Come on, get going.
You can't stay here all night.

445
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,998
Okay, Cossack.

446
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,473
You know the Park Towers?

447
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,596
- Yeah, sure.
- Deuce-a-bells.

448
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,592
Yeah, I'll be there.

449
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,754
Asta, where did you put that piccolo part?

450
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,118
Where did you put it? No, where is it?

451
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,151
You planning to spend the night?

452
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,276
No, I was just looking for my instrument.

453
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,557
- Is it one of them big bass tuba things?
- Yeah, that's it.

454
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,312
There it is.

455
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,949
Thanks.

456
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,952
If it was any bigger, it'd bite you.
Get it and get.

457
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,589
Solid.

458
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,030
Come in. You're early.

459
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:08,118
I was getting on a nervous kick,
sitting around there waiting.

460
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,919
- Darling, this is Mr...
- Clarence Krause.

461
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,833
Affectionately known
at Local 802 as Clinker.

462
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,148
How do you do?

463
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,919
The first spot we hit is Mitch Talbin,
big-band booker.

464
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,230
They really flick the whiskers at his bakes.

465
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,595
I brought along the old licorice stick.

466
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,831
Of course, if the reedman's already riding,
I'm nowheres.

467
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,154
Mrs. Charles always wears her mouth
open with this outfit. Come along.

468
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,509
No.

469
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,672
Swinging the classics
is strictly off the cob.

470
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,637
- Taxi.
- A gate who knows his dots...

471
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,995
takes his Beethoven
and his Brahms straight.

472
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,593
You know what I mean?

473
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,595
Get in.

474
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,348
No, thanks.

475
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,510
- We don't want to intrude.
- Get in.

476
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,755
- I'll be seeing you.
- Get in.

477
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,871
I've been waiting for you to come home.

478
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,918
I thought you were still noseying around
out on the boat.

479
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,833
No, I didn't care so much
for the passenger list.

480
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,751
I've been with the cops all day.

481
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,549
They suspect me for Drake's killing
because the guy owed me some dough.

482
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,755
That's silly.

483
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,593
If a guy owes you money and you kill him,
he can't pay you.

484
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,033
Very smart.

485
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,714
Elementary.

486
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,552
I tried to tell them Drake paid off.

487
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,916
I even signed a receipt that was written
in Drake's handwriting.

488
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,831
But they couldn't find that receipt.

489
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,911
I sent The Shiv over to see why.

490
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,070
I know you've got that receipt, Nick.
I want the cops to get it.

491
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,634
I want you to tell them where you found it.

492
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,836
You should have done that right away.

493
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,388
Yes, I intended to.

494
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,759
I'm a little forgetful.

495
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,400
I don't like people
who forget things like that.

496
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,471
See that you don't forget again.

497
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,834
I'll remind him.

498
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,472
- Is that the spot?
- Yeah.

499
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,388
Just a minute.

500
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,353
You forgot something.

501
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,317
Yeah.

502
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,633
You needn't wait.

503
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:28,070
- Man after my own heart.
- After my heart, you mean.

504
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,628
And probably get it,
if I don't dig up that receipt.

505
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,073
- Dig it up?
- Yes.

506
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,799
- I thought you said...
- It got us out of the cab, didn't it?

507
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,189
They might not have believed
that I didn't have it.

508
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,430
- Oh, Nicky.
- Don't worry, darling.

509
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,036
We're on no spot that a solution
of the crime won't get us off.

510
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,279
Penthouse, you know.

511
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,918
These Talbin jams are the tops.

512
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,390
But, it's like I told you,
strictly for gates and gut-busters.

513
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,954
I'll tell you what.

514
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,713
- You're a slush pump man.
- Come again?

515
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,718
Strictly from Memphis.

516
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,593
And you?
You're a canary, strictly from Memphis.

517
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,990
- "Canary"?
- I could say you pluck a hot harp.

518
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,749
If Mr. Charles doesn't find that receipt,
he'll be plucking a harp.

519
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,028
- Mitch-boy!
- Clinker.

520
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,190
- I see you brought the pipe.
- Ready to light.

521
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,998
I want you to meet a couple of friends.

522
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,355
- Mellow-man McGee and the missus.
- How do you do?

523
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,431
- How do you do?
- Hottest pump man in Memphis.

524
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,954
- Second hottest.
- Do you play an instrument, too?

525
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,999
- No, I'm a mud hen, a bird, a canary.
- A canary?

526
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,838
Strictly from Tennessee.

527
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,633
Talbin had Drake and the band
booked for a big tour.

528
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,075
Tommy didn't leave enough money
for a decent funeral.

529
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,118
Even asked me to square a $12,000 marker
for him before he was shot.

530
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,555
I hope you kissed your $12,000 good-bye.

531
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,791
That money never left the station.
I always thought he was a bad risk.

532
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,668
- New talent, darling?
- This is Baby... Mrs. Talbin.

533
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,239
How do you do?

534
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,548
We met before.

535
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,552
At the Charity Ball? Remember,
when you dropped your necklace?

536
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,755
Yes.

537
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,718
Why aren't you wearing it?
You're wearing the earrings.

538
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,870
It's at the jeweler's, having the clasp fixed.

539
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,918
- Let's get going. They're starting to roll.
- Yeah. Come on in.

540
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,230
What's your name?

541
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,509
Nemo!

542
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,636
Clinkersville. This skin I gotta get.

543
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,632
Put it in the deck.
Shuffle it up and shuffle it up.

544
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,314
- Spread some of that friendship.
- Bop me.

545
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,799
Bop.

546
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,795
Love it.

547
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,678
Come on.
Live a little, Ziggy. Live a little, man.

548
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,038
My body needs lifting. Lay it on me.

549
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,078
I love it.

550
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,919
Hold it, playmate.

551
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,272
Okay, you can save it.

552
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,396
Tommy Drake won't stay dead on me.

553
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,836
From out of nowhere, his broken-down
theme song comes back to haunt me.

554
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,194
Sounds rather catchy.

555
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,159
<i>Tune in, man. I'm talking about that
broken-down Under the Stars jazz.</i>

556
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,038
<i>- Under the Stars?
- Yeah, and the piccolo part, yet.</i>

557
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,076
Piccolo part, what about it? You got it?

558
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,196
Relax man, it's been cremated.

559
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,955
Dig that music.
It sends me out of this world.

560
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,600
- Should have sent you a little sooner.
- Yeah.

561
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,794
I'm sorry, I don't feel it yet.
That ain't it yet. I don't feel it.

562
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,555
That's it.

563
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,113
Yeah. Now I'm getting it.
That's more like it.

564
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,351
Come on, you,
start mixing, let's flip it now.

565
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,198
Clinker, is he here?

566
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,077
- Who?
- The Reed.

567
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,720
No, he ain't here yet. But it's still early.

568
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,915
Hey, come on, get with it.
They'll think you're a couple of squares.

569
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,434
That don't sound like the old Hollis juice.

570
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,673
That's Fran. Fran Page. Hollis' old flame.

571
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,753
Unless I got my photographs mixed, she
had some fire left over for Mr. Drake, too.

572
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,355
Yeah, the 88-man grabbed her off
and then he gave her the Fuller.

573
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,109
The "Fuller"?

574
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,232
The brush.

575
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,669
Well, invite her over to the bar
and have a drink.

576
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,514
Okay, order me a double bourbon
and better make it the same for Fran.

577
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,036
- Think she'll like that?
- She can always give it to me.

578
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,597
- Clinker.
- Well, hi-dee-dee! Long time no.

579
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,070
We really rode it high at that shuffle
of yours the other night, didn't we?

580
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,390
- Yeah, it was a wonderful jam.
- Join us for a drink.

581
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,916
I'll have to take a rain check. I'm with
the Nick Charles department tonight.

582
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,116
- Nick Charles, the detective?
- Yeah.

583
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,232
I don't care for anything.

584
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,949
I thought you told us he was a pump man.

585
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,795
I didn't want you to think I was loading up
your jams with a bunch of squares.

586
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,235
They were the squarest hipsters
I've ever seen.

587
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,390
- Yeah.
- What are they doing in a trap like this?

588
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,471
They're looking for The Reed.
He's disappeared.

589
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,675
- Really?
- Yeah.

590
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,829
I didn't know that.

591
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,151
Why, I thought that's what
you came here to see Fran about.

592
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,955
No, I came to see her about a job
I can get her in Havana.

593
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,233
Well, hi-dee-dee.

594
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,509
Hey, Fran.

595
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,673
Hello, Clinker.

596
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,314
I just caught you. Still the same old Fran.

597
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,072
Still plugging The Reed's tune, too.

598
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,151
That's the least I can do for him, isn't it?

599
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,198
- I've been looking all over for him.
- What do you want, lessons?

600
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,317
Why don't you stay off it?
You know I've always been in his corner.

601
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,311
Sorry. I've got the jumps.

602
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,833
You need some laughs.

603
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,036
Come on out and meet
a couple of friends of mine.

604
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,157
- No, I don't feel like meeting anyone.
- May we come in?

605
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,155
Fran, this is Mr. And Mrs. Nick Charles.

606
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,032
How do you do?

607
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,192
Well, you're very jivey. A hep warbler.

608
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,511
Mr. Charles is a bit of a schmo.

609
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,510
I thought perhaps you might be able
to help us locate Buddy Hollis.

610
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,238
He seems to have evaporated.

611
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:23,359
Somebody's been giving you a bum steer.
I don't know anything about Hollis.

612
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,115
Where is he?

613
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,668
Why don't you ask me
if I killed Tommy Drake?

614
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,751
You probably had good reason to.

615
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,955
Look, your three minutes are up
and this line is busy.

616
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,429
- So hang up the phone and get out.
- What's the fuss?

617
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,555
Get them out of here.

618
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,279
- Just going.
- Okay. Make mileage.

619
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,077
Get lost, you offbeat, rinky-dink.
You're nowhere.

620
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,509
Ree-bop.

621
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,753
I don't believe
there is any such person as Buddy Hollis.

622
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,752
There must be. Missing Persons Bureau
reported him seen...

623
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,389
in Chicago, Denver, Palm Beach and
Hollywood, but all at the same time.

624
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,870
Darling, how could he be
in all those places at the same time?

625
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,513
A split personality.

626
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,555
Well...

627
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,234
I think I detect a receipt-hunting party
of Mr. Amboy's.

628
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,038
Amboy? Nicky!

629
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,638
Asta, get in your own bed.

630
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,032
Now you stay there, Asta.

631
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,391
This wonderful bed.
I'm going to sleep for 20 years.

632
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,556
When you get up, don't wake me.

633
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,157
Nicky! What are you doing up, darling?

634
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,915
I heard your voices.
I hardly ever get to see you.

635
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,798
- Look at what time it is.
- That clock's fast.

636
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,916
Who's going to ride me to school
in the morning?

637
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,718
- Your mother.
- Your father.

638
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,313
We'll both ride you to school.

639
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,472
Now, you kiss this fiend good night,
and I'll plant him.

640
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,398
Come on. Up you go.

641
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,477
Go on. You too, you night owl.
Douse the light.

642
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,911
Here we go.
The Piggyback Express to Sleepy Town.

643
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,994
How about a story, Dad?

644
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,640
No story for you tonight.
You've got to get some sleep.

645
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,154
But, your stories always put me to sleep.

646
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,199
Well, all right, but just a short one.

647
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,431
Now let's see. Yes.

648
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:57,031
Once upon a time, there was an outlaw
named Dangerous Dan McGook.

649
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,679
Now one... Well...

650
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,476
- What's this?
- That's protection.

651
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,229
Protection.

652
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,676
I don't think you'd get much protection
from an old blunderbuss like that.

653
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,352
That's just an antique.

654
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,395
Antique.

655
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,153
What about McGook?

656
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,435
Son, I think that story
is a little too scary for this time of night.

657
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,751
- But I like to get scared.
- Well, I don't. It frightens me.

658
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,032
Look, I'll tell it to you
the very first thing in the morning.

659
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,189
- How's that?
- Okay.

660
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,872
- Good night, fella.
- Good night, Pop.

661
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,871
Sleep tight. Good night, Asta.

662
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,074
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting dressed.

663
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,035
Dressed?

664
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,349
Well...

665
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,714
- I might as well get up, too.
- No, you're tired. You stay in bed.

666
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,596
I feel fine.
All I needed was a good night's sleep.

667
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,873
Why all the darkness?

668
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,153
It's dark in here.

669
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,440
Open the curtains
and let some daylight in.

670
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,913
- What time is it?
- 4:00.

671
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,798
- In the morning?
- Yep.

672
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,316
- Same morning?
- Same morning.

673
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,515
What are you getting dressed for?

674
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,789
- I'm gonna run over and visit the Thayars.
- At 4:00 in the morning?

675
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,395
That's the best possible time
to ask questions.

676
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,313
People aren't such artful dodgers
at 4:00 in the morning.

677
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,517
- I'm going with you.
- You're going right back to bed.

678
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,194
We're in this together. I'm going with you.

679
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,719
If I can ever get into my shoes again.

680
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,914
- Yes, what is it?
- Mr. And Mrs. Charles to see Ms. Thayar.

681
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,713
I'm sorry, sir. Ms. Thayar's asleep.

682
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,196
It's very important. You'd better wake her.

683
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,512
- I'm afraid I can't.
- John, what is it?

684
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,434
Ms. Thayar, this is an unusual time
to come visiting but I've got to talk to you.

685
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,317
You've done enough talking already.

686
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:33,313
Janet, I tried to get in touch with you.
Mr. Charles had to do what he did.

687
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,198
- It was for Brant's own good.
- That's a neat switch.

688
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,158
- So now you're his benefactor.
- And yours, too.

689
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,790
Unless you'd enjoy being a widow.

690
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,155
Very well.

691
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,191
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

692
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,510
Ms. Thayar, I... Well.

693
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,994
- Would you like a drink?
- Well, this is my brandy hour.

694
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:07,072
- Mrs. Charles, would you like a drink?
- I could stand some sherry.

695
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,390
The weapon that killed Tommy Drake...

696
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,711
seems to have the ballistics experts
rather neatly stumped.

697
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,315
That leads to one of two
possible conclusions:

698
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,871
Either the gun was handmade,
or it was a pre-ballistics antique.

699
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:24,477
Probably very early 18th century.
Perhaps the property of some collector.

700
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,832
Dear me, I'm terribly sorry.

701
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,718
- Here, use this.
- Quite all right. Thank you.

702
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,916
Well, that's very interesting,
but not interesting enough...

703
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,072
to come breaking down doors
at this hour of the morning.

704
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,917
My husband is neither a gunsmith
nor an antique collector.

705
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,833
No, but wasn't the City Museum...

706
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,878
given a million-dollar art collection
by your father?

707
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:53,393
Yes, Father gave the museum his...

708
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,115
Elizabethan and Chippendale pieces.

709
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:57,875
His...

710
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,873
Georgian silver...

711
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,999
and yes, his Flemish paintings,
his Reynolds, and his Rembrandt.

712
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,069
Well, that was very generous
of him, indeed.

713
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,879
Your father was a collector
of many things, wasn't he?

714
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:16,670
Coral, coins, jade, and, I believe, quite
an assortment of 18th-century firearms.

715
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:21,709
All the weapons my father had,
pistols or guns, went to the museum.

716
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,468
Just a minute, Mr. Charles. Just a minute.

717
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,990
Your father seems
to have overlooked a few.

718
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:31,390
Am I to understand that the gun that
hung here was given to the museum?

719
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,879
No, Mr. Charles.

720
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,790
I didn't give that gun to the museum.

721
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,033
It was my favorite.

722
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,800
Originally owned
by an 18th-century nobleman.

723
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,429
He used it only once, to destroy
a brigand who had certain aspirations...

724
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,511
toward the gentleman's daughter.

725
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,634
You had that gun with you
the night Drake was murdered.

726
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,755
Well...

727
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,515
Were you perhaps intending to use
it on a brigand...

728
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,795
who had certain aspirations
toward your daughter?

729
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,077
Perhaps, but he wasn't the man
who was killed.

730
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,833
But he and Drake were just about
the same height and build.

731
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,310
In the darkness of a below-decks office,
there could have been a mistake.

732
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,029
True, but before Mr. Drake was killed
I was relieved of that gun...

733
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,673
by my son-in-law.

734
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,717
That's a fine wedding present for you.

735
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,995
Throwing the whole mess
right into Phil's lap.

736
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,594
Here, I want you to feel secure
for the rest of your life.

737
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:21,070
You won't have anything to worry about
until they throw the switch.

738
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,469
You're lying and you know it. And you...

739
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,430
Yes? This is she.

740
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,913
I see. Yes, of course. Just a minute.

741
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,709
All right.

742
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,834
I see. Of course.

743
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,430
I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me.

744
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:06,831
- Well, do you wish to arrest me?
- Mr. Thayar, I am not a policeman.

745
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,388
If the police want my testimony,
I'll be glad to oblige.

746
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,754
That'll make the police happy.

747
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,638
Now if you don't mind,
I'd like to go back to bed.

748
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,079
Darling? Mr. Thayar would like
to go to bed.

749
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,874
It's nice to know people still go to bed.

750
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,994
Mr. Charles and I used to go to bed once.

751
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,635
Park Towers.

752
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:54,109
Apartment F, first bedroom to the right.

753
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,754
Driver, hold it.

754
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,317
I should have worn a sleeping bag.

755
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,517
"125 Prospect Terrace.

756
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,470
"Apartment 3A." Look at that.

757
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:20,432
We're going home. And I'm not tucking
you in bed. I'm tying you in.

758
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:24,479
If you'll just put your blurry blue eyes
a little closer, you'll see it.

759
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,149
It's the impression left
by the pressure of a pencil.

760
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,275
Oh, yes.

761
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,511
"125 Prospect Terrace."

762
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,797
A phone call at 4:30 in the morning
must be pretty urgent.

763
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:39,311
I have a hunch our headstrong heroine
will be along soon.

764
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,911
Sometimes I even amaze myself.

765
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,074
- Follow that car?
- Movie fan.

766
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,268
Yes. Follow it.

767
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,557
That jail doesn't look like
125 Prospect Terrace.

768
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,191
She's probably going to tip Brant off
to her father's story.

769
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:39,352
Your father started threatening me
and I took the gun away from him.

770
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,273
- What did you do with it?
- I put it on a cabinet in my office.

771
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,793
Never saw it again.

772
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,719
You don't believe me, do you?

773
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,075
- Of course I do.
- You'll have to step on it.

774
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,958
- I told you, this is against the rules.
- Just a moment, please.

775
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,952
- Honey, what'll I do about this call?
- I don't know.

776
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:59,312
But I guess it's worth a chance. Be careful.

777
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,310
All right, driver. Keep right on her.

778
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,392
Keep going. You're losing her.

779
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:34,190
Look, the city shelled out over $10 million
to install that traffic system.

780
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:38,671
I don't think they'd have given the job
to a guy that spells "go," capital S-T-O-P.

781
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,394
He's right, it's spelled with a small "S."

782
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:04,028
- That sounds like it. Come on.
- No more jam sessions for me.

783
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,712
But that's our clarinet.

784
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,119
Fran Page.

785
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,951
Turn it off, dear, will you?

786
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,509
It must've just happened. That record
would've played for about three minutes.

787
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,511
You don't think that Janet...

788
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,991
- How did this happen?
- I thought perhaps you could tell us.

789
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,509
She phoned me less than a half-hour ago.

790
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,188
Offered to sell me some information
that would help Phil.

791
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,239
Sell or withhold information?
About an antique gun, for instance?

792
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:54,317
It's true, Phil got that gun from Father.
But he didn't use it.

793
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,073
He put it on a cabinet in his office
and never saw it again.

794
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,229
I see.

795
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:02,353
We followed you until you left the jail
and then we lost you. What delayed you?

796
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:06,558
The money. She wanted $2,500.
I had to go to Phil's place to get it.

797
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,393
Ms. Page didn't strike me
as a blackmailing type.

798
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,472
I don't think she was.

799
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,192
She said she needed the money
for somebody out of town.

800
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,592
Had to have it in a hurry. She seemed
quite upset and nervous about it.

801
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,630
Hollis doesn't seem
to be anywhere in town.

802
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:30,356
- Hello? Hotel Vesta.
- Yes, Ms. Page stopped here several times.

803
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,517
- Was she alone?
- Now, we don't go snooping on our guests.

804
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,750
Their comings and goings
are their own business...

805
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,398
and that applies to your Ms. Page.

806
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,550
She just stayed in her room
and kept to herself.

807
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:43,633
Except about 1:50 she'd go out and
get back about 3:10, that's all.

808
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:48,352
Outside of after dinner, when she did
the same thing, only then she'd leave...

809
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,954
about 7:50 and get back about 9:10.

810
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,874
That's all I know about her because
we don't go snooping on our guests.

811
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,192
I don't suppose you'd remember
whether she ever had any visitors?

812
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,955
No question of not remembering. Just a
question of not snooping on our guests.

813
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:07,238
No concern of ours if some Al Amboy and
a couple of his friends come visiting her.

814
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:10,995
They were nice, polite young gentlemen.
Went out with Ms. Page at the same time.

815
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,674
She never called a cab
and there was never any outside.

816
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,228
So I just decided she liked to take walks
for her health.

817
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,630
If you've come to fish for information,
you've come to the wrong place...

818
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,631
because we never go snooping
on our guests.

819
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,280
- Mr. Purdy, telephone.
- Yes.

820
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:32,035
1:50, 3:10. 7:50, 9:10.
Sounds like visiting hours.

821
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,872
Those are visiting hours.

822
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,949
He latched onto something, teacher.

823
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:44,835
Are there any public institutions,
a jail, a prison, or a hospital...

824
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:48,435
- within 10 minutes walk of here?
- Fast walking or slow walking?

825
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,115
Never mind.

826
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,029
But you're sure there's no Hollis there?

827
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,029
I see.

828
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:01,237
Unless you want to try the city pound,
the dump, or the waterworks...

829
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,915
that just about takes care of
all the public institutions in Poughkeepsie.

830
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,309
Maybe he's in some private institution.

831
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,430
Clinker, you're magnificent.

832
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:15,034
We have to walk 10 minutes in various
directions till we find the right institution.

833
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:18,192
- You've got the nose of a bloodhound.
- Don't let him worry you.

834
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,350
The rest of your face looks fine.

835
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,154
Ten minutes right on the nose
of the bloodhound.

836
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,390
And we're running out of directions.

837
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,594
- "Valley Rest Home"?
- Well, let's have a look.

838
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:41,237
I'm afraid Mr. Hollis' condition
will not permit visitors.

839
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:45,314
- Exactly what is his condition?
- Exactly how does that concern you?

840
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,198
Dr. Monolaw, we're his friends.
We have the right to see him.

841
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,999
Unless you produce him,
I'll produce the police.

842
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,158
- Bring in nine.
- Yes, sir.

843
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,428
Mr. Hollis has not had very many visitors.

844
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:02,438
His mind has been completely shattered
by alcohol.

845
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,553
He sits in his room and plays the same
melody over and over without variation.

846
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,596
I must ask you to be very careful with him.

847
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,911
He seems to be suffering from
a deep-rooted guilt fixation.

848
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,748
Visitors have a somewhat disturbing
effect on him.

849
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,751
Sometimes, an alarming effect.

850
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,832
Buddy, there are some friends to see you.
They want to talk to you.

851
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:26,194
Hi, kingpin.

852
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:31,430
I see you got the old jute-flute.

853
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,990
I heard you breezing it just now.

854
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,113
Still headman, kid.

855
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,631
Come on, candy-boy.

856
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:47,073
Don't you recognize me?
This is the old Clinker.

857
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,837
Remember how we used to belt it out
at those jam sessions?

858
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,634
Well, I just came up here
to see how you feel.

859
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:04,475
Well, I thought maybe there was
something you might want. Radio?

860
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,268
Noise box.

861
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,514
Nothing happens.
The poor guy is nowhere.

862
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:18,798
Buddy, the boys at the boat
have been asking about you.

863
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:19,915
The boat?

864
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,992
They think you got a pretty rough deal
from Tommy Drake.

865
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,115
Nurse.

866
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:27,158
It's all right, Buddy.
Visiting hours are over.

867
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:35,032
- Isn't there any way to make him talk?
- Lf there is, I don't know it.

868
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,634
Why do you think
he kept staring at me that way?

869
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:39,790
Probably identified you with a Ms. Page.

870
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:41,836
She came to see him.
She was very kind to him.

871
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,310
- Do you think that perhaps if I were alone...
- Much too risky.

872
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,356
This has upset him.
He may become violent.

873
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,431
I'm sorry, I will not permit it.

874
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:54,628
Well, we'll have to try something else.
Thank you, Doctor. I'll be back.

875
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,792
You apparently have time to waste.
I'm sorry, I haven't.

876
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,755
I'm sorry, but I'll be back.

877
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,470
I think maybe he'd open up
if we kept coming around or something.

878
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:11,028
I think I'd rather figure out
some "or something."

879
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,519
Darling, I'm not very hungry.

880
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,989
I think I'll go back to the hotel
and freshen up.

881
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:17,913
- Well...
- I have half of Poughkeepsie on my face.

882
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,991
I like that corner particularly.

883
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,030
We'll join you as soon as we finish.

884
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:27,158
- Who gets the bone?
- I do.

885
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:42,354
Well, we'll just send it to the laboratory.

886
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:48,154
- Have we any report on yesterday's case?
- Not yet.

887
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,878
I'm worried about that.

888
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:19,236
Hello, Buddy.
You're not afraid of me, are you?

889
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:22,952
I'm a friend of Fran's. You remember Fran?

890
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:26,350
We're doing an act together now.
Great little partner, Fran.

891
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,078
We always feature your song.
Tears the place apart.

892
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,194
Go on, play it.

893
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,512
It's my favorite tune, too.

894
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:49,310
I suddenly got a sneaking suspicion
that she wasn't going back to the hotel...

895
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,516
so I checked and found I was right.

896
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:55,315
She didn't come back here
to take a second crack at Hollis, did she?

897
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,870
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Charles.
Your wife is not here.

898
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:00,789
Please.

899
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:05,873
That's swell, Buddy.

900
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,629
Swell.

901
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:13,079
- Buddy, I want you to tell me...
- Fran always used to come in right on cue.

902
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,113
I'll breeze it again and you try it.

903
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,758
Well, go on. Take it.

904
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,036
I can't. I have a sore throat.

905
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,112
I caught a cold last night.

906
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,917
I'll tell Fran I saw you.

907
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:38,949
I'll tell her you played the song for me.

908
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,713
- You don't sing with Fran.
- I'm trying to...

909
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:45,389
You never sang with Fran.
They sent you to spy on me.

910
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,710
- No.
- They told you to say that Fran sent you?

911
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,872
- No.
- Yes, I killed Drake. Now I have to kill you.

912
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,712
That's what I hid the gun for.

913
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,633
- No, nobody... Don't shoot.
- I have to kill you.

914
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,073
No, Buddy, don't.

915
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:09,393
- Darling.
- I'm all right.

916
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:12,438
- Take it easy, boy.
- How did he come to have a gun?

917
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:14,431
Don't you search the rooms
of your patients?

918
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:17,751
This is a rest home, not a jail
or an asylum. Give him some water.

919
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:21,753
- And some hand grenades to play with.
- That's the murder gun.

920
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:25,397
- He confessed he killed Tommy Drake.
- I see.

921
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,798
- I'll take that.
- Just a minute.

922
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,678
I think this may interest the police.
Let's go.

923
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:38,948
- Yes, I'm calling New York.
- Darling, why bother to call?

924
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:42,157
- We'll be home in a couple of hours.
- I want to hear my son's voice.

925
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,038
For a moment there,
I didn't think I'd ever hear it again.

926
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:48,271
- Hollis didn't look like a killer.
- Maybe he isn't.

927
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:53,631
- He admitted it, he even took a shot at me.
- For a complete miss.

928
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,594
- Meaning what?
- Meaning that in his condition...

929
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,910
he couldn't hit the ocean from a rowboat.

930
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,878
And Tommy Drake was shot
right through the middle of the heart.

931
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:06,556
- Then why did he confess?
- Cracked minds play funny tricks on you.

932
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:10,709
And, by the same token, you can play
funny tricks on cracked minds.

933
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:15,312
Now I have a hunch that Fran Page
knew exactly who the trickster was.

934
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,231
That's why she was murdered.

935
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:19,715
I see.

936
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:23,315
All you have to do to prove your innocence
is confess your guilt.

937
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:26,115
Yes, I'm calling New York.

938
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:31,589
Hello?

939
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:35,510
Hello, Mrs. Charles.
I just came up to talk to your husband.

940
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,554
No, I can't talk to him on the phone.
I'll wait.

941
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,756
- May I talk to her, please?
- Bertha?

942
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,032
- Yes, she's here.
- May I talk to her, please?

943
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:50,198
- Hi, Mom. When are you coming home?
- Hello, darling.

944
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:53,877
I'm afraid we won't be able
to have dinner with you again.

945
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,760
Yes. You can stay up until 9:30.

946
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:59,548
We'll come in and kiss you
when we get home.

947
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,676
Tell Bertha we'll be home in a few hours.

948
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,513
Okay, I'll tell her as soon as
she comes in. Bye.

949
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,073
As soon as... Nicky?

950
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:10,153
Come on, Mammy.
We don't want to settle in Poughkeepsie.

951
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,389
What's the matter?

952
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:14,950
Nothing. Janet's waiting at the apartment.
She wants to talk to you.

953
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:19,113
Well, it's all set. The hound can ride
with us in the baggage car.

954
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:30,314
Do you always have to ride in
the baggage car because of the M-U-T-T?

955
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:33,198
He understands every word.

956
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,158
- Two spades.
- Two no trump.

957
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,912
With a hand like this
I should have a finger bowl. I pass.

958
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,036
- Three no trump.
- I pass.

959
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,519
What do you think?

960
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,073
He needs glasses.

961
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,752
Yes, either that
or he has something in his eye.

962
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:56,591
- What is it, boy? A cinder?
- Here, let me see.

963
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,717
Come here. Hold still.

964
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,198
Say, let me see that.

965
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:08,679
Why, that's the same...
Of course, I remember the lace perfectly.

966
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:12,272
- Where did you get this?
- Eve's Fifth Avenue, I think.

967
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:16,114
- I mean, is it yours?
- I only steal cocktail napkins.

968
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:20,149
Of course it's mine. No, it's Janet's.

969
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:23,797
When she spilled that drink last night,
I must have taken it.

970
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:25,552
Yes, I had that bag.

971
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:29,992
This is exactly like the handkerchief
that was lying beside Fran Page's body.

972
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:33,511
I thought it was odd that Miss Janet
got there after we did...

973
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,716
and then burst in without knocking.

974
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:42,191
Janet's home alone with Nicky.

975
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,192
- What do you mean, alone?
- I thought I didn't hear right.

976
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:51,319
Nicky said Bertha was out.
Nick, Janet got rid of her.

977
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:52,828
She lied to me.

978
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:56,555
She said that Bertha was there.
Why would she lie to me unless...

979
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,918
You know how she hates us.
She blames us for everything.

980
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,390
This may be her way of...
Nick, what'll we do?

981
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:08,152
- How long before we get to New York?
- An hour, at least.

982
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,589
- Hour?
- Yeah.

983
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,274
Now, nobody's gonna hurt a little kid.

984
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,518
No, that's right, Mommy.

985
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,236
No one would hurt a little boy.

986
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,038
Only a few more minutes.

987
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:32,590
How could you leave him alone
with a strange woman?

988
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,193
I thought she was your friend.

989
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:37,113
She only wanted me to go
to the druggist to get her headache pills.

990
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,668
I wouldn't have gone,
only she looked so pale and weak...

991
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,479
- I couldn't refuse her, could I?
- Why couldn't you refuse her?

992
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:45,358
- Darling, how could she know?
- I'm sorry.

993
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:47,676
Mr. Charles, not a sign of him.

994
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,239
I've been all over the neighborhood.

995
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:51,311
The elevator boy remembered
taking him down...

996
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,995
and that Thayar chick told him
to tell Bertha they'd be back soon.

997
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:58,630
Two hours is quite a little while.

998
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:05,519
Your kid. Yeah, we'll get on it right away.

999
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:07,879
Yes, right away.

1000
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,431
Made you some fresh coffee.

1001
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,469
- Thank you, Bertha.
- None for me.

1002
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:17,752
You'd better have some, darling.
It'll calm your nerves.

1003
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,791
Check with the police again.

1004
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:23,277
Darling, I've checked five times.
They're tearing up the town.

1005
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:25,874
- Lf anything pops, they'll call us.
- Hey, Mom, Pop.

1006
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:27,313
Nicky, darling.

1007
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,919
I've been pinched.

1008
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:30,994
Where'd you find them, Kramer?

1009
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,752
Nabbed them outside the Capitol Theatre.

1010
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:35,149
Darling, would you take Nicky
to his room, please?

1011
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,309
Come, dear.

1012
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:40,189
Ms. Thayar, I'm afraid
I'm going to have to be blunt.

1013
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:43,272
- Just exactly what's the idea?
- I'll be glad to tell you.

1014
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:46,238
If you'll just give me
a chance to catch my breath.

1015
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,069
Thank you very much.

1016
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,754
It's a pleasure. I'll report to headquarters.

1017
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:54,509
Well?

1018
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,477
While Bertha was out,
you had some visitors.

1019
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,235
They insisted upon waiting for you.
One of them kept playing with a knife.

1020
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:02,959
- Yes?
- The other kept eyeing Little Nicky...

1021
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:06,316
and repeating how tough it'd be
on you if anything happened to him.

1022
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,710
I got worried. I took him to the bedroom
and pretended to put him to bed...

1023
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,313
and I took him out the bedroom door.

1024
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,356
I'm very grateful to you for that.

1025
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:16,000
But I can't understand it
making such a fuss.

1026
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:21,231
Well, perhaps this will explain.

1027
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,750
That's what I came to see you about.

1028
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,514
Yes, I did get to Fran's apartment
before you.

1029
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,956
She was dead when I got there.
I was going to remove the knife...

1030
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:36,350
and then I remembered about fingerprints,
so I took out my handkerchief.

1031
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,795
But I just couldn't. So I got up and ran...

1032
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:42,634
and I was afraid of being seen
and I started down the back staircase.

1033
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:47,191
Suddenly, I remembered the handkerchief.
I rushed back to get it and found you.

1034
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:52,199
I don't know why I didn't tell you about it.
I guess I just got panicky.

1035
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,950
That's the truth. Please believe me.

1036
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:14,472
- You awake?
- No, I'm asleep.

1037
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:19,878
- Why are your eyes open?
- I'm counting sheep.

1038
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,039
I'll bet they're black ones...

1039
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:23,838
like Amboy and his pals.

1040
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,478
And Brant and Hollis.

1041
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,279
And Fran Page.

1042
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:31,673
Are you sure her murder
was tied up with Drake's?

1043
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:33,959
I think it adds up.

1044
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,031
Fran Page was going to talk.

1045
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:39,193
If she intended to pin
the Drake murder on Hollis...

1046
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,350
why should anyone
have wanted to kill her?

1047
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:43,192
Hollis is hopelessly insane...

1048
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,396
totally unresponsible for his acts.

1049
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:49,478
She was obviously going to pin it
on someone else.

1050
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:51,756
And that someone else did away with her.

1051
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:55,276
Then with Hollis in his present condition
and taking the blame...

1052
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:58,033
this someone else probably feels
pretty safe.

1053
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:01,112
But suppose Hollis regained his senses?

1054
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:04,837
All you'd have to do
is perform a miracle and cure him.

1055
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:08,754
The impression that Hollis is cured
and ready to talk is all we'd need.

1056
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,513
What would happen?

1057
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:13,950
The killer would certainly try to get him
before he had a chance to talk.

1058
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,554
That might be our chance to get the killer.

1059
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:21,077
<i>Mammy, I think we're going to reopen
the S.S. Fortune.</i>

1060
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,315
We?

1061
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:25,039
You and I, and the police department.

1062
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,274
My Nicky.

1063
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,436
- Albert.
- Mr. Brant.

1064
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,990
- My table.
- I didn't know you'd be here tonight.

1065
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:02,755
- The only table I have left is...
- Darling, it's a wonderful crowd.

1066
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:05,792
Nick, what worries me...

1067
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:10,154
- Table three, Mr. Brant. Is that all right?
- That's okay.

1068
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:13,152
- George, table three for Mr. Brant.
- Yes, Mr. Brant.

1069
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:15,959
He promised they'd come.
If they do, I want them at our table.

1070
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,871
What's all this finger business about?

1071
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:21,396
I'm having the most likely candidates
seated where I can watch them squirm.

1072
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:23,277
I hope it goes as smoothly as you expect.

1073
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:25,191
If anything should happen to poor Hollis.

1074
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:28,590
I've taken every precaution.
Sergeant, your slip is showing.

1075
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,190
Thanks. There's the inspector.

1076
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:36,509
- Everything all right, Nick?
- All right.

1077
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:40,877
Now all we have to do is sit quiet
and keep our fingers crossed.

1078
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:44,157
I have so many fingers crossed now,
I can't lift my drink.

1079
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:46,391
Some shiny eyes in the jungle.

1080
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,391
- Albert.
- Mr. Talbin.

1081
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,198
- Our reservations.
- Of course.

1082
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,838
Just a moment, please.

1083
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,438
- Table four, Mr. Talbin.
- Thank you.

1084
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,670
- George, table four.
- Yes, Mr. Talbin.

1085
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:01,479
- Well, my old friend slush pump.
- How do you do?

1086
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:06,193
- Do you attend all the openings?
- Naturally. It's my business.

1087
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,671
If Hollis has really come out of the fog...

1088
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,796
and is half as good as he was,
I can book him.

1089
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,996
I think he's going to surprise you.

1090
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:20,991
- Stunning jewelry. Those earrings.
- Very attractive.

1091
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,752
The earrings are higher up.

1092
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:30,675
The charm boys.

1093
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:31,954
Table for four.

1094
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,270
- AI Amboy.
- Yes, Mr. Amboy.

1095
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:39,155
Table two, Mr. Amboy.
Henry, table two.

1096
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:40,559
This way, please.

1097
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,155
- Good evening, Mrs. Amboy.
- Good evening.

1098
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,800
How did you enjoy
your trip to Poughkeepsie?

1099
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:51,478
I loaned Fran Page the dough
to send Hollis up there.

1100
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,030
He's okay now, so I'm here to collect.

1101
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:58,315
Someday I'm going to take lessons from
you on how to get blood out of a stone.

1102
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:01,472
I just have my boys
break it up into little pieces.

1103
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:09,791
Remind me not to turn my back
on that little group tonight.

1104
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:12,673
That Mrs. Amboy,
the necklace she's wearing.

1105
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:16,839
- She can afford it.
- But it matches Mrs. Talbin's earrings.

1106
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:21,634
- Let's have champagne tonight.
- Sure.

1107
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:25,555
I don't feel like dancing,
let's sit this one out.

1108
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:27,232
Anything you say, Baby.

1109
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:29,709
How much would a trinket like that cost?

1110
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,909
- Darling.
- $12,000?

1111
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:36,394
The value is unimportant. It's the thought.

1112
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:39,310
The thought happens to be
that $12,000 is just about...

1113
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,834
the amount that Drake owed Mr. Amboy.

1114
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:48,190
Well, bossman, everything looks set.

1115
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:52,319
The Doc says the joint's having
a kind of a restorative effect on The Reed.

1116
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,153
He's even got him convinced
that he's never been away...

1117
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,993
that all the murder biz was strictly
a bad dream.

1118
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,798
So he'll play all right.

1119
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,636
He'll look good up there, too.

1120
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,676
Well, prettier the bait,
the better the catch.

1121
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:06,034
Come again?

1122
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:08,236
That's an old saying I just made up.

1123
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:09,833
Look, bossman...

1124
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,998
Fishes number five and six
are beginning to nibble.

1125
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,116
- Five.
- I beg your pardon?

1126
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:17,713
Good evening.

1127
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,916
I was using my influence
to get you a good table.

1128
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,115
We're sitting with Mr. Brant.

1129
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:23,794
I didn't think you people
could be dragged into this place.

1130
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:28,271
We couldn't very well offend Mr. Brant.
After all, he's a member of the family now.

1131
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,313
We'll see you later.

1132
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:35,072
Mr. Thayar, I ran across your gun...

1133
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,071
at the Valley Rest Home in Poughkeepsie.

1134
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:39,674
The inspector insisted
that I leave it with him.

1135
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:43,514
He had some strange notion that since
Brant is a member of your family now...

1136
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,079
he's trying to shield you.

1137
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:48,118
The inspector is famous for his little jokes.

1138
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:52,759
Hey, bossman, I hate to bring this up but...

1139
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,070
I don't know about
sitting next to The Reed.

1140
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:58,038
Suppose somebody takes a shot at him
and misses.

1141
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:59,474
Would you rather he were hit?

1142
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:03,075
No, but if you miss one thing,
well, you're bound to hit another.

1143
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:06,358
And I thought, instead of being up
on the stand beside him...

1144
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:09,352
I could, kind of, play off-stage?

1145
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:12,552
Why don't you play at the table?
That would be even safer.

1146
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:15,234
Unless our murderer
makes a cushion shot.

1147
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:18,475
That's what I like. Sympathy.

1148
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:32,151
If you saw something you knew
wasn't there, what would you do?

1149
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:36,280
I'd go back to Poughkeepsie
with Dr. Monolaw.

1150
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:40,476
And you saw a blank space
where you knew something should be?

1151
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:43,438
I see that all the time. What is it?

1152
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,593
Mrs. Amboy's necklace.
She isn't wearing it anymore.

1153
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:50,389
- I don't like it.
- Sorry, but that's the way it's got to be.

1154
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:54,949
- She isn't.
- And Mrs. Talbin is wearing it.

1155
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:02,910
- It matches her earrings perfectly.
- What do you get out of it?

1156
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,389
A sudden urge to merge with the Talbins.

1157
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:06,709
Come on.

1158
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:12,756
I am sending Johnson to Rio to close
the deal. He'll be a sensation.

1159
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:15,798
They've never seen anything like him
in this country.

1160
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:25,797
This is not really my racket.

1161
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:28,390
I have to give her one whirl
to keep the franchise.

1162
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,198
Yes, I know what you mean.

1163
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:33,353
I wanted to ask you to have a drink
with us but those tables...

1164
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:34,953
are hardly big enough to hold one.

1165
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,917
Have a drink with us
when you finish dancing.

1166
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,274
We're finished.

1167
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:40,435
Waiter.

1168
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:48,118
- It's a wonderful opening.
- Yes, isn't it?

1169
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:52,115
Think Hollis will ever be able
to take Drake's place?

1170
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:55,158
Nobody will ever be able
to take Tommy Drake's place.

1171
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:57,595
Yes, I know how you folks feel about him.

1172
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:00,558
After all, it was you who cleared up
his debt, wasn't it?

1173
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,995
I told you I didn't let him have the money.

1174
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,274
What difference?

1175
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:07,033
$12,000 or a necklace
probably worth more.

1176
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:11,878
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You should.

1177
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,270
Didn't you just redeem the necklace?

1178
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:19,438
Mrs. Talbin's been wearing that necklace
all evening.

1179
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:23,072
In that case, somebody had better tell
Mrs. Amboy she's lost hers.

1180
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:24,354
Wait a minute.

1181
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:29,157
I just redeemed the necklace
in the powder room.

1182
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:32,269
- What?
- I gave it to Amboy that night.

1183
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:35,433
I didn't want anything to happen
to Tommy Drake.

1184
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:46,675
And I nearly threw a $100,000 tour
in that guy's lap.

1185
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:50,397
That tour would have meant
a lot of money to you, too, wouldn't it?

1186
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,710
Of course, but...

1187
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,109
But you wouldn't advance him
the $12,000...

1188
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:58,909
even though you knew Amboy was
preparing a cement kimono for him?

1189
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,877
I told you he was a bad risk.

1190
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:04,753
Seems very puzzling.

1191
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:10,079
But I'm sure that Hollis
will soon make it all very clear.

1192
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:16,472
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
Buddy Hollis and his famous clarinet.

1193
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:18,676
After the number, he will make
an announcement...

1194
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:22,389
that's going to throw a bombshell
into the Tommy Drake murder case.

1195
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:17,594
- Lf the party gets rough, duck.
- I'm practically under the table now...

1196
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:19,591
but not the way I'd like to be.

1197
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,791
Well, Buddy, I guess this is it.

1198
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:31,996
Time for that little bombshell.

1199
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:35,397
Buddy, tell everyone
how Tommy Drake was murdered...

1200
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,990
how the murderer took advantage
of your condition...

1201
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,310
and planted a gun on you
and then worked on you...

1202
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,356
till he convinced you you'd killed Drake...

1203
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:45,352
and how, with murder on your conscience,
you went to pieces.

1204
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,749
Tell them why Fran Page was murdered...

1205
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:50,997
how she came to visit you several
times at the Valley Rest Home...

1206
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:54,072
and gradually pieced things together
and threatened to talk.

1207
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:56,879
Tell them about the someone
who went to her apartment...

1208
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:59,030
to try to keep her quiet and couldn't...

1209
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,634
and how he turned on
her phonograph, loud...

1210
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:05,349
so that her screams couldn't be heard
as he plunged his knife into her.

1211
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,590
You told me who he is.
You told the police.

1212
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:10,319
Now tell all these people who he is.
Tell them.

1213
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,109
Come on, Buddy. Tell them.

1214
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,395
Never mind, Buddy. I'll tell them.

1215
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:18,040
It's true about Fran. I killed her. I had to.

1216
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:19,633
And I killed Tommy Drake.

1217
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:22,359
I didn't intend to.
I wanted to keep him away from Phyllis.

1218
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:25,830
I went to reason with him
and when I saw that gun on the cabinet...

1219
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,478
I think we know the rest.

1220
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:28,834
I don't think you do.

1221
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:32,435
Everything would have been all right
if you hadn't meddled into it.

1222
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:35,114
This is the last time
you're going to meddle...

1223
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:38,678
Keep away, all of you.

1224
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:42,799
Don't touch him.
You knew about Tommy and me all along.

1225
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:44,753
Weren't you clever?

1226
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:46,832
That's why you wouldn't lend him
the money.

1227
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,751
You wanted Amboy to kill him.

1228
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:52,037
But I crossed you up by paying Amboy off
with my necklace.

1229
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:55,075
I couldn't let him take you away from me.

1230
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:58,152
I thought Phil Brant did it.
That's why I took a shot at him...

1231
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:01,391
at the Charles' apartment. But you did it!

1232
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:05,189
Let the police have him.

1233
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:08,431
I swore I'd kill the man
who shot Tommy Drake.

1234
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:16,678
Well, I guess you did.

1235
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,911
And to think you did it all
with your own little hatchet.

1236
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:25,234
- I'm proud of you, darling.
- Thank you, angel.

1237
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:29,194
- Now, Nick Charles, is going to retire.
- You through with crime?

1238
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:31,069
No, I'm going to bed.

1239
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:32,479
That reminds me.

1240
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,149
English
