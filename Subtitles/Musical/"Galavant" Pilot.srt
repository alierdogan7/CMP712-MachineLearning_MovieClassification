Mm.

355
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,600
Is there lemon in there?

356
00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:38,769
Yes... My King?

357
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,706
Some unsqueezed lemons.

358
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:45,376
Well, it's delightful. Just delightful.

359
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:46,711
[Sighs]

360
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,045
Kill the king, make her watch.

361
00:15:48,046 --> 00:15:49,547
No!

362
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:52,550
[Woman gasps]

363
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,252
Mmm.

364
00:15:55,253 --> 00:15:56,754
Mmm. [Lips smack]

365
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:59,256
Sid, fetch me a drink.

366
00:15:59,257 --> 00:16:03,260
When he tells me to fetch,
those are my favorite moments.

367
00:16:04,996 --> 00:16:06,664
Thanks again for the drink.

368
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:07,765
<i>Drinks.</i>

369
00:16:08,632 --> 00:16:11,133
Right. Thanks again.

370
00:16:11,283 --> 00:16:14,271
My father used to tell stories of you,

371
00:16:14,272 --> 00:16:16,507
- of your skill in battle...
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

372
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,704
Your heroism, of your goodness.

373
00:16:21,361 --> 00:16:22,780
What happened to you?

374
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,915
I mean... eh.

375
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:29,286
Oh, come on. I've come a long way.

376
00:16:29,287 --> 00:16:31,789
Surely I deserve some kind of backstory.

377
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,823
[Sighs]

378
00:16:34,025 --> 00:16:36,360
[Chuckles]

379
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:39,196
All right. [Inhales deeply]

380
00:16:39,197 --> 00:16:42,533
My parents were people of
massive, massive appetites.

381
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,035
They loved everything... they
loved food. They loved drink.

382
00:16:45,036 --> 00:16:47,304
But most of all, they loved each other.

383
00:16:47,305 --> 00:16:50,140
Ironically, they also hated each other.

384
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:53,143
[Clears throat] And they
fought violently every day.

385
00:16:53,144 --> 00:16:55,512
Didn't have time for much else, in fact.

386
00:16:55,513 --> 00:16:58,515
So... at the age of 8, I swore off love.

387
00:16:58,516 --> 00:16:59,950
[Chuckles]

388
00:16:59,951 --> 00:17:02,319
Devoted myself to doing
something better with my life

389
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,488
than wasting it on love.

390
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:07,824
So I read, I trained, I learned languages.

391
00:17:07,825 --> 00:17:09,826
All the time other young men
chasing spent chasing girls,

392
00:17:09,827 --> 00:17:12,704
I spent that time bettering myself.

393
00:17:13,556 --> 00:17:15,866
But I come from a long family of lovers.

394
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:18,368
You can't fight genetics.

395
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:21,505
So when it inevitably happened...

396
00:17:21,506 --> 00:17:23,506
- When I fell...
- You fell hard.

397
00:17:23,508 --> 00:17:24,808
I fell hard.

398
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:25,976
And her?

399
00:17:26,716 --> 00:17:28,478
[Squeaks]

400
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:30,013
She fell softer...

401
00:17:30,014 --> 00:17:32,082
As it turns out.

402
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:36,253
[Sighs]

403
00:17:36,254 --> 00:17:38,588
Look, I'd love to help. Really, I would.

404
00:17:38,589 --> 00:17:40,090
But I'm...

405
00:17:40,091 --> 00:17:42,359
I'm sort of out of the whole
"damsel in distress" business

406
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,827
at the moment, so...

407
00:17:43,828 --> 00:17:46,563
I listened from below
as he ordered my parents to their death.

408
00:17:46,564 --> 00:17:48,365
And after coming all this way,

409
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:50,367
your advice is for me
to just turn a blind eye

410
00:17:50,368 --> 00:17:52,536
and watch king Richard destroy my kingdom

411
00:17:52,537 --> 00:17:54,538
and everyone I've ever loved?

412
00:17:55,047 --> 00:17:56,113
What?

413
00:17:58,748 --> 00:18:00,577
Did you just say...

414
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:02,145
"King Richard"?

415
00:18:04,343 --> 00:18:05,343
Oh, come here!

416
00:18:05,344 --> 00:18:06,849
- Isabella.
- Father!

417
00:18:07,513 --> 00:18:09,514
Ah!

418
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:12,779
Maybe<i> this</i> is what we're looking for.

419
00:18:15,187 --> 00:18:16,754
Ooh, sweet!

420
00:18:16,755 --> 00:18:18,089
Any luck on the Jewel, Richard?

421
00:18:18,716 --> 00:18:19,824
Well, actually, my dear...

422
00:18:19,825 --> 00:18:21,793
I know. I know. You're working on it.

423
00:18:21,794 --> 00:18:23,594
Well, why don't you stop working on it,

424
00:18:23,595 --> 00:18:28,099
start acting like Galavant,
and<i> do something</i> already?

425
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:32,277
Will do, My Queen.

426
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:34,906
[Sighs]

427
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:39,177
I swear, if I have to hear
the name Galavant one more time.

428
00:18:39,178 --> 00:18:42,180
If only there was some way that I could...

429
00:18:43,341 --> 00:18:44,248
Ah.

430
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:45,716
She's a pretty young thing,
isn't she, Gareth?

431
00:18:45,718 --> 00:18:48,755
- A bit plump for my liking.
- Plump?

432
00:18:48,756 --> 00:18:50,354
The girl is 100 pounds soaking wet.

433
00:18:50,355 --> 00:18:54,365
I know, but I like skinny.
Like, really unhealthy skinny.

434
00:18:55,027 --> 00:18:56,527
[Sighs]

435
00:18:56,528 --> 00:18:58,296
You love your parents, don't you, my dear?

436
00:18:58,297 --> 00:18:59,730
Leave my parents be.

437
00:18:59,731 --> 00:19:02,366
Leave them be, or so help me,
I will kill you myself.

438
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:03,634
And spunky.

439
00:19:03,635 --> 00:19:05,036
Ha! More like "chunky"!

440
00:19:05,037 --> 00:19:06,070
Just stop it, Gareth!

441
00:19:06,071 --> 00:19:08,105
I am trying to do something here!

442
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,441
Fine. If we can't beat
Galavant on his turf,

443
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,143
we'll bring him to our own.

444
00:19:12,144 --> 00:19:13,978
If you want your parents to live,

445
00:19:13,979 --> 00:19:15,646
you will travel to find Galavant.

446
00:19:15,647 --> 00:19:19,650
You tell him that I, king Richard,
have invaded your kingdom.

447
00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:21,652
Offer to pay him with the jewel.

448
00:19:21,653 --> 00:19:26,657
When that doesn't work,
I want you to tell him this...

449
00:19:26,658 --> 00:19:28,292
I feel like you should be
writing this down.

450
00:19:28,294 --> 00:19:30,629
- I will remember it.
- It's a bit long.

451
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:32,933
I'd really just be more
comfortable if you wrote it down.

452
00:19:32,935 --> 00:19:35,261
- I will remember it.
- Like a steel trap.

453
00:19:35,263 --> 00:19:38,238
- Always had a wonderful memory, this one.
- Fine.

454
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,337
You tell him that king Richard is a...

455
00:19:40,338 --> 00:19:42,506
Is a cruel and vicious man.

456
00:19:42,507 --> 00:19:44,408
Four months I hid in that cellar.

457
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:46,410
He and his queen slept right above me.

458
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:49,747
And you tell him that every night,

459
00:19:49,747 --> 00:19:51,080
you would listen while
he screamed at his queen...

460
00:19:51,082 --> 00:19:54,418
Screamed at his queen,
and each night I would be left

461
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:56,987
with only the sobs of that poor woman.

462
00:19:56,988 --> 00:20:00,491
Every night, she would cry out,
"I made the wrong choice.

463
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:04,300
I'm so sorry, Gals. I'm so sorry."

464
00:20:04,302 --> 00:20:06,710
She must have left some maidens back home.

465
00:20:06,712 --> 00:20:08,312
Never knew what she meant.

466
00:20:08,314 --> 00:20:10,215
"I'm so sorry, Gals."

467
00:20:12,396 --> 00:20:14,605
[Echoing] I love you, Gal.

468
00:20:15,427 --> 00:20:17,107
"I'm so sorry, Gal."

469
00:20:17,638 --> 00:20:20,802
She was saying, "I'm so sorry, Gal."

470
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:25,282
We leave tomorrow at sunrise.

471
00:20:25,283 --> 00:20:29,019
