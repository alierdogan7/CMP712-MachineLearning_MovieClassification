1
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:55,208
You shouIdn't go there.
- Why?

2
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:15,421
You're right. But not even a year
has passed since Rupa died

3
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,089
How can I proceed about
Sunita's wedding?

4
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:26,736
You yourseIf chose Ramesh for Rupa.
I want the good reIationship...

5
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,901
between our famiIies to go on.
Rupa didn't enter our famiIy

6
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,512
Our misfortune

7
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:45,415
In her stead if her sister
enters our famiIy...

8
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,061
Sunita couId fiII the void
Rupa has Ieft

9
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:54,492
My son Ramesh wishes so too.
- PIease forgive me. Right now...

10
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:59,263
I can't commit anything. It's necessary
to take Sunita's opinion

11
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:05,608
She's Ieaving for Dehra Dun to meet
her friend. She has no time to spare

12
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,946
I'II taIk to her some other time,
and I'II Iet you know

13
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:14,512
Ramesh is as dear to me as you are

14
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:19,521
I expected as much from you.
We shaII Ieave now

15
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:53,155
Daddy, we're short of time. WiII you
buy some magazines? I'II buy tickets

16
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,350
After you

17
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,428
May I make Iight your burden?

18
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:38,927
Never trust a stranger. Once a man
in a queue offers to heIp me...

19
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,503
I pass him a big parceI, and 2 minutes
Iater, I turn around to reaIise...

20
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,209
that he has made Iight
of my burden for good!

21
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:55,880
Strange! The queue hasn't moved
an inch in the Iast 15 minutes

22
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:59,050
At this rate, by the time we reach
the ticket window...

23
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,055
we'II be oId men, yes Iady?

24
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,724
Someone moves, at Iast!

25
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,229
Here's a coupIet about
intransigent peopIe

26
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,913
One what?

27
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,080
First cIass what?

28
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,918
WiII you say where to?

29
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:46,266
Why do men Iaugh more when
they grow oId? You know why?

30
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:50,764
You aren't moody at aII. Move ahead.
There are others waiting

31
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,111
RascaI! To Dehradun

32
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:57,983
What?

33
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,449
I mean?
- A Iady. To Dehradun

34
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,117
The rascaI and the Iady?
- First cIass. Dehradun

35
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,691
You want a ticket?

36
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:15,458
Why not? I don't work for the raiIway.
I can't traveI without tickets

37
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,803
One ticket. Dehradun. First cIass

38
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:27,863
What for are you Iaughing?

39
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,409
No!

40
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,552
SiIence!

41
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,621
Shut up!

42
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:51,089
Get this cIear, fatso. If you Iaugh
once more, I'II break your head!

43
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,573
Not again!

44
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,480
What are you doing?
WiII you kiII the poor feIIow?

45
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:21,255
Why beat up a fat man for nothing?
- He's Iaughing to tease me!

46
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:27,998
Is no one supposed to Iaugh
without your permission?

47
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,766
I know! You're two of a kind!

48
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,871
You're too much!

49
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:41,745
Just compare. How are two of us
of a kind?

50
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:45,274
Listen fatso. If you Iaugh again,
you won't be spared

51
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,881
Strange! How can you be so insistent?
Have you booked a seat?

52
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:51,680
Or have you bought out
our freedom too?

53
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,719
No one's supposed to Iaugh,
no one sneezes, no one coughs!

54
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:58,290
This is imperious!
- I was taIking to the fatso

55
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:01,297
I don't want to taIk to you.
- Nor am I interested!

56
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:05,699
But you can't deny a free man
his freedom to Iaugh!

57
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:13,144
He wiII Iaugh, of course he wiII!
- Never. If he does, he gets bashed up

58
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:18,306
As if this is your house!
Hey fatso, Iaugh

59
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:21,748
Let's see who bashes you up.
Come on my friend, Iaugh

60
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,126
I fight for you, and you give up?

61
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,062
Laugh!

62
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,499
Does he dare Iaugh?

63
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:39,600
Is that so? Mister, now this
is a matter of my prestige!

64
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:44,341
I shaII forsake non-vioIence
for vioIence!

65
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:51,340
If you Iaugh, she beats you.
FIyweight punches

66
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:57,347
If you won't, then I swear
by those intoxicating eyes...

67
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:04,093
the punches I Iand on you wiII be
of the forcefuI, soIid kind!

68
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,525
And this paunch of yours,
this overfiIIed paunch of yours...

69
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:11,192
this overstretched paunch...
how eIse do I describe this paunch?

70
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,371
No this paunch is incomparabIe!
What a paunch!

71
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,876
What a naughty paunch!

72
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,917
What happened?

73
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,418
He's dead

74
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:04,322
Dead?

75
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:10,991
What eIse? He's was so fat. He must've
been suffering from bIood pressure

76
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,762
You stopped him from Iaughing it out.
And when he was getting it out...

77
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:17,432
you hit him on the head with a stick!
- Not stick. UmbreIIa!

78
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:22,596
The same. The head is a deIicate organ.
Even a minor injury can kiII

79
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,934
He might not be compIeteIy dead.
PIease do something!

80
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,782
Do what? His puIse has stopped,
breathing has ceased. He's coId

81
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:40,457
Now what might happen? At the next
station, the poIice wiII arrive

82
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:46,454
Then, arrest! Then the murder triaI
in the court...

83
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:50,460
where I wiII have to depose
about who the kiIIer is!

84
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,874
You haven't a chance of escaping!
The Iong arm of the Iaw grabs...

85
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:59,374
every criminaI, every murderer.
And the consequence...

86
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:04,709
the consequence is... the gaIIows,
the hangman's noose!

87
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:12,490
What happened?

88
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,828
What is it?

89
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,505
She has fainted. For reaI

90
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,638
Look mister, the joke is over

91
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:33,103
I've never even seen you before!
At the raiIway station...

92
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:36,837
I just Iaughed at a joke you cracked!
Now you've Ianded me in a fix!

93
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:40,246
Don't worry, friend. She'II come around
soon. You've stood by me for so Iong

94
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,250
Just a whiIe Ionger now.
- Not at aII!

95
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:45,857
At the next station, I'm getting
out of this coach

96
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,285
Strange!
- Yes, I am. Get out of my way

97
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,529
The station is near.
I have to get off

98
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,428
How are you feeIing?

99
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,295
Where is he?
- The corpse?

100
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:33,028
Yes!
- I threw the corpse out of the train

101
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,736
His Iuggage?
- I threw it out too

102
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:43,043
Not to worry. No evidence Ieft
of fatso's murder

103
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,380
But...
- Not to worry at aII. Trust me

104
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:52,580
The poIice won't suspect you. And aII
my Iife, my Iips wiII stay seaIed

105
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:59,595
You're such a gentIeman!
- What to do?

106
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,761
I saw you in troubIe,
and I took heart

107
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:10,337
I toId myseIf, ''AniI, what is Iife
if you can't be of heIp to someone?''

108
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:16,408
So I decided! Even if the courts
sentence me to death, I'II heIp you

109
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,277
So nice of you!

110
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,996
Sit, Iet me see if the poIice is here

111
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,630
AII cIear. Get off

112
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,804
CooIie! Take the Iuggage

113
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:43,642
Come

114
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,159
Come aIong

115
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:06,664
Hey mister, taIk properIy.
What do you think I am?

116
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:11,165
I toId you. I'm not traveIIing without
ticket. My ticket was in my waIIet

117
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,066
I might've Iost my ticket in the coach.
- Which coach?

118
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:18,675
The one I first took. Then I changed
my coach because...

119
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:23,506
there was a man was wooing a Iady.
He made me do strange things!

120
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,240
Let's take a Iook.
- Come aIong

121
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:40,963
Is this my punishment for being Iate?
- Not that. I thought... forget it

122
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,361
Have you brought your car?
- Yes

123
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:47,700
Come on, Iet's go to Mussoorie?
- Are you mad? First, you come home

124
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:50,534
If you want to go to Mussoorie,
we'II pIan the trip Iater on. Come

125
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,894
This time Iast year
... on a night Iike this

126
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:24,300
I wish I was with my sister then.
- Sunita, I stiII don't understand this

127
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,735
What?
- Your sister faIIs for...

128
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:32,181
this drummer in Mussoorie,
but he doesn't reciprocate

129
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:36,284
But for something as triviaI...
- She wouIdn't kiII herseIf, right?

130
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:41,419
You're right. But it didn't stop
at Iove. The affair had progressed

131
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,319
What do you mean?
- This was Rupa's Iast Ietter

132
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,220
She wrote to me from Mussoorie

133
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:51,595
''My dear Sunita, tonight
I went to Park HoteI again''

134
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:57,174
''Rocky was the onIy one I was seeing.
He was pIaying his drums...''

135
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,678
''and everyone was swaying.
But I was so afraid''

136
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:09,286
''Why hide it from you? A few days ago,
I crossed the Iimit''

137
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:14,382
''If Rocky says yes, I Iive
if he says no, I die''

138
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:22,794
For an innocent girI who has crossed
the Iimit, who has Iost her dignity...

139
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,600
the consequence is death, not Iife

140
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:33,137
But I won't forgive him.
I'II avenge Rupa

141
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:37,714
You know Rocky?
- I don't. But I've come to know...

142
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,351
that this year too, Rocky and his band
wiII be pIaying at Park HoteI

143
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,414
That's why I'm going to Mussoorie.
- But what can you do?

144
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:48,156
The girIs' hockey team from coIIege
is reaching Mussoorie tomorrow

145
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,824
I've prepared them.
- What?

146
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:55,329
Rocky and hockey. Doesn't it rhyme?
- PerfectIy!

147
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,162
He shouIdn't be abIe to get out of bed
for a year or two

148
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,533
Let Ms Ruby rehearse the new tune

149
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,366
Have you met Rocky?
- I'II be seeing him tonight

150
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:15,570
Are you girIs ready?
- And raring! Just draw him out

151
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,246
We'II pickIe him!

152
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:20,913
See you this evening

153
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:40,938
This is the spot. Rupa jumped
from here to her death

154
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:45,940
Had I been with her, it might not
have happened

155
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:51,808
Rocky wouIdn't have seduced her,
nor wouId she have to kiII herseIf

156
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:57,748
But this drama isn't over yet.
Tonight that scoundreI wiII face me

157
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,617
He wiII be Iooking for another prey
obIivious of the fact that...

158
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:06,328
I'm here to settIe the score,
to avenge Rupa's death

159
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:42,161
At every step, you need my heIp.
- So you're here too?

160
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:45,460
Given the chance, where won't I be?
- Who is this?

161
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:49,668
The incident on the train...
- AIIow me to introduce myseIf

162
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:54,402
Ladies, my name is AniI Kumar.
My pseudonym is Sona

163
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:58,016
I'm not a poet by profession,
but ever since I was a chiId...

164
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,711
I've had this knack of spewing Iyrics
whenever I see something pretty

165
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,783
AIIow me to coin one for you.
- Give him an inch, he'II take a yard

166
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:18,595
Not to trust her. I'm fine where I am.
Inching to yards isn't my cup of tea

167
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:22,273
HeIIo Mr Sona. Note for you.
From Mr Rocky

168
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:37,448
Give him an inch, he'II take a yard!
- What happened?

169
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:43,720
The drummer here, Rocky. He was after
me for a song. I wrote one for him

170
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:48,931
Now he says, tonight he has
a sore throat. He wants me to sing!

171
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,799
Am I here to sing?
- No sir

172
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:56,200
Doesn't Mr Rocky know who I am?
- Who doesn't know a miIIionaire's son?

173
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:01,671
Is my sociaI standing of no consequence?
- Why not? Even chiIdren know that!

174
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,940
He wants me to sing in this hoteI
and ruin my reputation? Never!

175
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:07,879
TeII him I won't sing. Go! Move it!

176
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:18,923
That was a cIose shave for us!
Had this one been ready to sing...

177
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:23,363
our evening wouId've been ruined!
- What did you say?

178
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:31,573
Chew this. You come to hear Rocky,
and you end up hearing him bray!

179
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:32,928
How did you Iike that braying?

180
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:37,126
Where is she off to?
- To congratuIate Rocky

181
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:40,371
What about me?
- Sit here. I'II wax eIoquent

182
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:51,310
Excuse me...
- Sit!

183
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,278
I'II be back soon

184
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:08,725
To teII you the truth, I'm scared
about taIking to girIs

185
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:11,435
Why?
- Last year, a Iady I spoke to...

186
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:15,105
jumped to her death from the 3rd fIoor,
and I take the bIame!

187
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:19,099
That's a nice opening Iine
to bait a new prey

188
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:22,346
What new prey?
- For exampIe... I

189
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,481
Very funny! May I chip in?

190
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:30,382
Not meant for you. Mr Rocky, I'm coId.
ShaII we go in?

191
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:33,785
How can we Ieave him aIone?
- Not to bother about him

192
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:37,022
He Iikes being Ieft aIone,
and aIone, he aIways wiII be

193
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,407
Back on Iast year's track?

194
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:57,076
Not to be afraid. No one's around.
Your secret is mine

195
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:01,951
I won't teII the poIice anything.
- TeII what? That a mad girI....

196
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:05,317
kiIIed herseIf? Am I to bIame?
- Not at aII!

197
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:09,624
You won't be jaiIed or punished.
But this bad worId is so suspicious

198
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:16,192
Worse than an eviI man, is a bad name.
- Whatever you say may be true

199
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:19,159
But as Iong as you're with me,
what have I to fear?

200
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:23,973
I'm with you. But you?
- I'm with you too

201
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,470
I don't feeI that way.
- What do I do make you feeI that way?

202
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:33,044
When in Iove, what do they do?
- What?

203
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:43,491
Not a bad idea! DefiniteIy enjoyabIe!
But you know what?

204
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,663
What?
- It's coId out here. ShaII we go in?

205
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:56,330
Who is that?

206
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,420
Where did Sunita say she'II be?
- Crane hiII.

207
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:14,354
Don't you step out of the room!
- Not at aII. Here I rot

208
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,092
Keep rotting

209
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:51,721
Back again? To harass me?

210
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:03,471
What happened? Why are you Ieaving?
- Because you aren't about to Ieave

211
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:08,236
I wiII. But the one you're expecting,
isn't coming

212
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:10,948
Who?

213
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:16,010
How do you know?
- ToId me himseIf

214
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:20,415
What?
- You asked him to come. But he won't

215
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,420
Why?
- Didn't ask that

216
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:27,893
And in his stead, here you are.
- Right

217
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:33,362
He toId me to teII you something.
- What?

218
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:41,511
Forget it! But consider this. You come
from a good famiIy. And he's a drummer

219
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:48,675
No match for you! Think! WouIdn't it
be nice if you found someone...

220
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,983
Like you?
- ExactIy! Consider me!

221
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:56,955
I'm handsome, with good precedents.
And as for money, uncountabIe!

222
00:34:57,295 --> 00:35:00,059
ReaIIy?
- Yes. The very soiI you stand on...

223
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:04,793
aII this is my property! These farms,
aII these hiIIs, this Iand

224
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:08,329
And that mansion you see...
- Is yours too?

225
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,364
My uncIe's

226
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:15,137
Look Mr AniI, I'm not interested
in your money or uncIe's mansions

227
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:17,609
Just give me Rocky's message

228
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,809
You mean Rocky's message?

229
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:24,211
Rocky toId me to teII you...

230
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:30,819
you have magic in those eyes!
- Rocky said that?

231
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:34,298
No. I'm saying this.
- What did Rocky teII you?

232
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:38,827
Said I must remember this!
Rocky toId me to teII you...

233
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:46,002
how IoveIy you are!
- Rocky said that?

234
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:49,272
No. I'm saying this too.
- What did Rocky...?

235
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:56,787
Listen! Don't get worked up.
Wait, I'II give you Rocky's message

236
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:00,287
I don't want any message! Get out!
- Hear the message

237
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,850
WiII you Ieave, or won't you?
- No!

238
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,186
You won't?

239
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:07,194
What's this?

240
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,605
Bye. Too many peopIe here

241
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:04,586
Strange! The band Iooks different.

242
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:12,930
Note for you. From Mr Rocky

243
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:20,730
I've just received news that
my uncIe in Madanpur is iII

244
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:25,642
I'm Ieaving for Madanpur. I don't know
when my uncIe wiII Iet me come back

245
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,103
If you want me to get back soon
work out something...

246
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:37,948
to send AniI Kumar to Madanpur. Once
he is here, I'II excuse myseIf

247
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:43,292
EIse, I won't be abIe to get back
before a month. I'm dying to see you

248
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:51,297
The hockey team Ieaves in a fortnight!
If Rocky returns afterwards...

249
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:57,302
who's going to bash him up?
- He'II come if AniI can bring him back

250
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:03,641
But how to make him go?
- Just say it with a smiIe

251
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:08,317
He'II even go to heII!
Let's soften him up

252
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:19,794
Excuse me, where can I find
AniI Kumar Sona?

253
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,999
He has gone to the rock n'roII cIub

254
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:32,895
Twist in the taIe?
- How?

255
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,423
This morning, you wanted
to make mincemeat out of me

256
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:39,997
And now, not onIy you, but even
your murderous girIfriends...

257
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:43,106
are grinning at me as if they're
aII my sisters-in-Iaw

258
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,975
Surprised, aren't you?
- Not at aII

259
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:52,313
My Iate grandfather used to say, there
are three kinds of reIationships

260
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,775
One, of hatred and quarreI

261
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,845
Two, of friendship and truth

262
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:02,717
And thirdIy, Iove and engagement

263
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:11,334
That in which you write out what
you can't bring yourseIf to speak!

264
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:26,605
This reason for the Iady's favours?
- No. ReaIIy...

265
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:31,150
For your sake, anything.
- WiII you go to Madanpur?

266
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,347
On one condition.
You're coming with me

267
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,851
50 miIes. Leave in the morning,
you're back by the evening

268
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,358
Serves your interest.
I enjoy your company

269
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:45,826
Meena wiII come aIong

270
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:54,169
If I go, I go with you aIone.
EIse, not! Get this cIear

271
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,450
AII right, I'II come aIone

272
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:04,513
Let's meet at ten tomorrow

273
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:13,792
If you need anything, if you want
the car to stop, signaI me with this

274
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,865
I'II stop the car, and I'II draw
AniI Kumar away from the car

275
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:20,298
Then you can come out.
- AII right

276
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:23,062
Where's my revoIver?
- Here, in the purse

277
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:25,542
Fine. I'm shutting this

278
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:28,535
ComfortabIe?
- Yes!

279
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,285
I'd be happier if you caII me Sona.
- Why?

280
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:44,449
It's short and sweet, and everyone
who Ioves me, caIIs me Sona!

281
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,792
I'm not one of those who Iove you.
- ReaIIy?

282
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:49,431
Come on.
- I'II put my bag in the boot

283
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,331
Not in the boot!
I'II put it on the backseat

284
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:58,135
Come on, you're driving.
You know the way, don't you?

285
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,740
Yes. Sit

286
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,922
PIease stop the car.
- Why?

287
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:21,084
Stop the car

288
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:33,997
What happened?
- The engine heats up very fast

289
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:37,503
I forgot to fiII the radiator.
- Where wiII you find water here?

290
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:41,009
There's a IittIe Iake
behind that hiIIock

291
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:44,380
Go and get the water.
- What a strange man!

292
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:48,151
WiII you make a Iady work?
- FamiIy tradition

293
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:50,386
My Dad, my fathers,
never Iifted a finger

294
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:59,026
They Iay around, pIayed chess, smoked.
But work? No! Beneath my dignity!

295
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,695
You have such bad habits

296
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:08,702
You and I won't ever hit it off!
- The Iady's favours for work?

297
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:13,036
And you get to Iie around,
pIay chess and smoke?

298
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:17,869
I'm not taIking chess and games.
I just want you to get water

299
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:22,107
WiII you fetch it, or won't you?
- You're screaming at me Iike a wife!

300
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:24,713
AII right, I'II get it

301
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:28,152
But for once, wiII you caII me Sona?

302
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,575
Not that water!
- Why?

303
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:55,274
It's dirty!
- It's perfectIy cIean

304
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:04,093
Meena wait. I'II take AniI away
for 10 minutes

305
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:06,762
Hurry! I'm nearIy passing!

306
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:13,095
HoId it! I'II whistIe on my way back.
Get into the boot when you hear

307
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:22,007
Sit

308
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:26,544
Isn't the weather IoveIy?

309
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:33,115
I say, isn't the weather IoveIy?
- Yes, IoveIy. Sit

310
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:36,459
Isn't this a IoveIy pIace?
- What?

311
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:41,628
I say, isn't this a IoveIy pIace?
- Yes, IoveIy. Sit

312
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:46,135
Come on, Iet's take a Iook ahead

313
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:50,270
AII right. I'm coming

314
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:54,541
No knowing what Iies ahead.
But I know that boot is fuII!

315
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:27,635
You keep Iooking backwards.
Anything speciaI behind you?

316
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:33,277
You are. Isn't that speciaI?
- Keep Iooking at me Iike that

317
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:40,414
I'II keep coming for you.
- And who keeps track of the road?

318
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:47,586
The one behind.
- Who trips and faIIs?

319
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:52,864
The one behind wiII hoId you

320
00:52:53,503 --> 00:53:01,000
Come, Iet's waIk together.
- No. This is my pIace. In pursuit

321
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:05,348
Pursuit? Are you going mad?

322
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:24,739
What was that?
- Time to get back

323
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:29,415
Do you take me for a train?
- No. BuIIock cart. Come on

324
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:34,422
Now she Ioves it, now she hates it.
GirIs nowadays, are so strange!

325
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:36,088
Wait, I'm coming

326
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:43,258
Meena, your scarf is dangIing

327
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:54,109
What happened to your romantic mood?
- Come on. Don't taIk rot

328
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:56,510
What's your name?

329
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:03,517
Move it

330
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:22,635
Sunita! Stop!

331
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:24,306
Stop!

332
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:52,157
10 miIes of dense forest from here on.
- I can see. Why did you stop? Drive

333
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:07,979
The road is bIocked.
Did I take a wrong turn?

334
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:16,852
This one is cIosed too?

335
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:21,619
I think we shouId've taken the turn
we missed

336
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:23,458
I toId you so

337
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:47,881
What happened?

338
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:53,892
The engine is overheated.
It isn't starting

339
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:56,565
ShouId be aII right
by the time it's morning

340
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:58,734
Who's staying here tiII morning?

341
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:06,172
I don't fancy spending the night here.
But there's no other option, is there?

342
00:59:06,576 --> 00:59:07,543
Why not?

343
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:19,245
Even if the car starts, it'd be very
difficuIt to find the way in the dark

344
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,857
If we go astray, who knows
where we might end up?

345
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:27,652
Maybe you don't know, there are bandits
in this forest. Dangerous animaIs too

346
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:34,761
None worse than you! Do you think
your pIoy is working?

347
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:38,604
You think you can make me stay
for the night?

348
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:42,011
You think your dirty, eviI design
wiII work?

349
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:50,285
I know your type, spoiIt rich!
I had gauged your intentions...

350
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:54,114
when you wanted me to come aIone.
You shouId know that as of now...

351
00:59:54,324 --> 01:00:00,285
I'm not at your mercy. Meena is with me.
And she has a Ioaded revoIver

352
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:04,694
In a minute, you can be dead!
Come on, take a Iook!

353
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:28,718
Stop! I say, stop!
Or I'II smash your head!

354
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,988
Come back.
- No! Don't come near me!

355
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:36,731
Your Iife is in danger here.
There are wiId animaIs everywhere

356
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,661
Go away from here!

357
01:00:40,436 --> 01:00:44,668
You're coming with me.
- No! Come near, and I'II kiII you!

358
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:48,505
D'you get it? I can kiII you! Stop!

359
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:00,015
Let go!

360
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:02,358
Leave me!

361
01:05:41,671 --> 01:05:46,631
I've been Iooking for you. I even
tried to Iook for you Iast night

362
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:51,638
I was caIIing your name.
Maybe you didn't hear me

363
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:55,049
Let me tie that

364
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:32,280
This road Ieads straight
to your hoteI in Mussoorie

365
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:37,353
Listen...

366
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,168
My car has stopped

367
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:56,109
Let's take a Iook

368
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:00,505
Are you very angry?

369
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:04,377
Won't you forgive me?

370
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:32,977
What kind of a joke is this?
Are you coming, or not?

371
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:37,743
Are you coming, or not?

372
01:07:39,922 --> 01:07:41,753
Okay, I'm Ieaving

373
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:47,319
What a strange predicament!
Are you coming, or aren't you?

374
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:52,423
Getting down from the hiII isn't easy.
Miss a foothoId, and you faII

375
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:59,769
What do you want?
- PIease forgive me

376
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:07,112
Forgiven. Come aIong.
- Say it aIoud

377
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:14,778
AII right, I forgive you! Get up!
- Not Iike that. First, take my hand
