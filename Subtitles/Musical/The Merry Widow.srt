1
00:00:00,567 --> 00:00:04,230
"Merry Widow"

2
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:22,318
Oh, what fun we were there
when they fall

3
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:25,720
We have a reason
that's worth marching for

4
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,295
Not for battle or banner or foe

5
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,229
but for girls...

6
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,333
When we're marching

7
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:40,133
we never retreat for we're
charging a foe that is swift.

8
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:43,834
But when we're caught in a swell
of the enemy's girls...

9
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:47,409
Danilo...

10
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,641
For our country
will never make war

11
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:54,151
We have a reason
that's worth marching for

12
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:57,723
Not for battle or banner or foe

13
00:00:57,858 --> 00:01:01,225
but for girls...

14
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:02,350
When we're marching

15
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:08,365
we never retreat for we're
charging a foe that is swift.

16
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:11,095
But when we're caught in
the swell of the enemy's girls

17
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:16,099
then surrender to girls...

18
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,074
You may continue.

19
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:33,349
Thank you, madam.

20
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,089
Madam.

21
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,096
Pardon me, madam

22
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,329
for trespassing in your estate
and intruding in your privacy.

23
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:59,199
What do you want?

24
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:03,366
I come to deliver
a confidential letter.

25
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,774
This is very important, Madam.

26
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:10,844
Madam Sonia

27
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:14,746
if you should ever
meet Count Danilo

28
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:17,789
let me tell you he is terrific.

29
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,387
What is this? Count Danilo?
Terrific?

30
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,192
That's what people said.

31
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:28,391
Danilo? Danilo?

32
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,093
Yes, Count Danilo.

33
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:33,330
Now, Madam, this is absolutely
between you and me.

34
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:36,169
This Count Danilo is crazy
to meet you.

35
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:39,540
He tried everything.
In fact, he's desperate.

36
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:43,206
I really feel sorry for the man,
but you're such a widow.

37
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:47,308
Pardon me, Madam, what I mean is
you live in complete seclusion

38
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,446
and the poor man has no chance
to meet you socially.

39
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,251
Well, I'm very sorry.

40
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:55,520
I never heard of the gentleman
and I'm not interested.

41
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,425
Oh, you will be, Madam.

42
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,327
The man is in such a state of man

43
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,798
there is no telling
what he may do.

44
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:04,036
Who is this Count Danilo?

45
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,668
Me.

46
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:10,567
Who wrote this letter?

47
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,507
I.

48
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,475
I don't understand.

49
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:14,637
What do you want?

50
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:19,718
An answer. Yes or... when.

51
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,050
If you don't leave immediately
I shall report you to the king.

52
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:24,247
Oh, please, please.

53
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,223
Let me stay only a little while
and you may recommend me

54
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,759
to the queen.

55
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,795
It's hard to believe that
an officer of the royal guard...

56
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,364
Dares to approach the richest,
most powerful woman in the country...

57
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,491
And behaves like
a silly young cadet.

58
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,330
It's an outrage.

59
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,631
Now, don't get excited, please.

60
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:40,670
I am...

61
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,571
Unjust, that's what you are.

62
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,507
Put yourself in my position.

63
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:48,170
Imagine you saying all those
lovely things to me

64
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:50,339
and me wearing your mask.

65
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:53,782
Won't you spend sleepless nights
wondering what I look like?

66
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,649
Well, my situation is much worse.

67
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,688
I haven't slept for months.

68
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:58,119
Then I think
it would be very wise

69
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,491
if you leave immediately
and go to bed.

70
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,026
And dream about you.

71
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,756
No. No. You're cruel, Madam.

72
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,793
You're torturing me.

73
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,332
Day by day, I've been watching you

74
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,459
when you're riding your carriage
in the street.

75
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:11,831
I come up here every night.

76
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,765
I suppose I'll have to
call my servant.

77
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,738
They're all bribed.

78
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,207
Do you know I've been feeding
your dogs

79
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:22,371
with the finest imported salami
just to get quite a glimpse of you

80
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:23,777
and what do I see?

81
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:24,815
Your lovely little hands,

82
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,780
your dainty little feet and yet
the most beautiful thing.

83
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:29,418
Stop it.

84
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,457
Tell me. You're eyes.

85
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:35,527
Are they blue or brown?

86
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:40,065
Are you pretty or beautiful?

87
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,064
Gorgeous.

88
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:42,793
No. This is no time for joking.

89
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,764
I have been in many situations
but this is too much.

90
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,170
There's not a window in Marshovia
that I haven't jumped out.

91
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,402
I've got around
every kinds of band

92
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,808
but here I'm block. By what?

93
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:56,381
By your piece of flimsy material.

94
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:57,881
Oh, please. Have mercy.

95
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,652
Leave the veil between us, Madam.

96
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,584
Be a nice girl.

97
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,320
My dear Count, I'm very sorry

98
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,756
to be the cause of your suffering.

99
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,756
But, no... I...

100
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:13,730
But unfortunately, we are
in Marshovia and I am a widow.

101
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:16,130
Why don't you throw away
this old custom of ours?

102
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,201
And take off my veil.

103
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:18,668
Yes.

104
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,069
I'd do it in a minute
if there is any reason for it

105
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:26,637
or the slightest temptation,
but there isn't.

106
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,147
Maybe you can't see me very well?

107
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,081
Oh, yes. In fact, too well.

108
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:39,650
I'll admit you're very funny
but not terrific.

109
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,757
Not even carousal.

110
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:04,774
Madam, I want you to understand
once and for all.

111
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,678
Our romance is over.

112
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,048
Don't count on it any further.

113
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:13,186
I've tried to bring the moonlight
into your eyes

114
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,816
but you pull down the shade.

115
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:19,057
Alright. Forget me, if you can.

116
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,029
Go back to your solitude.

117
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:25,433
Put on your loveliest negligee
and wish yourself good night.

118
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:31,203
And please, don't include me even
in your dreams, will you?

119
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,834
Good night.

120
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,073
Well? I'm afraid not again.

121
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,439
Come, Muska.

122
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:15,745
No more salami.

123
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:59,416
A night in romance
is underlying done,

124
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:08,331
in vain through my window
the moonlight is drawn.

125
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:18,104
Oh, Viria, oh, Viria, oh, yes,
that's my tune.

126
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:24,843
I love the shepherd who run for
the truth.

127
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:45,099
Viria, oh, Viria,
don't leave me alone.

128
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:51,700
My little, my little love to you.

129
00:11:55,848 --> 00:12:03,414
Viria, oh, Viria.

130
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:09,188
I'm waiting for love,
lonely without thee was I.

131
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:35,617
Viria, oh, Viria,
don't leave me alone.

132
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:42,854
Love goes to love
and my heart is your own.

133
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,097
Viria, oh. Viria,
don't leave me alone.

134
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:15,222
Lonely with only my song.
Lonely without thee.

135
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,893
Good night. Good night, madam.

136
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,169
Oh, just a minute,
before I forget. Melissa?

137
00:13:59,305 --> 00:13:59,771
Yes, Madam.

138
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:01,539
Would you ask the secretary
to find out

139
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,701
the address of a certain, ah,
of a certain, ah,

140
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,747
what's his name? Count Danilo.

141
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,076
Oh, Count Danilo lives
in Queen's Avenue.

142
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:16,044
No. 25, second floor, apartment B

143
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,830
Thank you. Never mind.
That's all.

144
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,157
Good night, Madam.

145
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:35,606
Good night, Madam.
Good night, Madam.

146
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:20,841
I thought that this day
could be the day

147
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:30,719
when my heart would find
your love, your love again.

148
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:37,493
I thought that this day
would be the day

149
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:45,093
and my heart would learn to dance
dance again.

150
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:53,576
It was all just a fleeting dream.

151
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:01,711
Men are not, not what they seem.

152
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:09,784
And this beautiful day
only taught me to regret

153
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:19,201
but tonight will teach me
to forget.

154
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:53,398
I lay await, he's forgetting me.

155
00:17:53,539 --> 00:18:00,172
It was just not meant to be.

156
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:08,219
And so it is, I must close my book
on dreams

157
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:18,627
and I sealed it with regret
and forget.

158
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,450
Madam Menosca. Yes, madam.

159
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:51,563
My new dress. Yes, madam.

160
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:52,425
Get everything ready.

161
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,862
We're going to Paris tomorrow,
tomorrow morning,

162
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,695
as soon as possible. Yes, madam.

163
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,328
There's a limit to every widow.

164
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:23,058
The melody of laughter flowed
many times that

165
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:27,294
it flows here many times

166
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,765
Pretty lover, your pearls
and your lavander,

167
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:33,800
soon will enlighten the eye
of each cavalier.

168
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:38,205
Around a lei of roses and glances
and he glances like romances

169
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:44,544
once again I meant to be melody
of love in Paris in the spring.

170
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:14,210
Who is it?

171
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,541
It's your suspenders, your Majesty

172
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,382
Any news, your Majesty.

173
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,615
Conditions are bad. Terrible.

174
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,385
What do you hear?

175
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:28,493
Well, you see, your Majesty.

176
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:30,458
After all,
we're a sheep and cow country.

177
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:31,756
Who's complaining now?

178
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:32,761
The shepherds.

179
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,195
Ah.

180
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,130
I overheard two shepherds
in the street yesterday.

181
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:38,569
What did they say?

182
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,262
Now, tell me...

183
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,306
The opinion of the shepherd on
the street,

184
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:43,874
that's what I want to know.

185
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,306
They say when the richest woman

186
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,708
gets fed up in the country
and leaves.

187
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,144
Ah. So they're blaming me
for everything.

188
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,209
They're even telling jokes
about your Majesty.

189
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:57,152
Are they funny? That's bad.

190
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,483
If conditions don't improve,

191
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,819
the shepherds are going
to organize

192
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:04,061
They say there's already
some talk of black sheep movement.

193
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,061
Were they prominent shepherds?

194
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,290
Couple of East side shepherds.

195
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,695
Intellectuals? Yes.

196
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,495
Let them talk.

197
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:24,610
Are you staying out late tonight,
darling?

198
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,844
You ought to know
how it is these cabinet meetings.

199
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:29,112
Do you think
it will last all night?

200
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,852
Now, please don't bother me.

201
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,685
Too enough
to have a widow in Paris

202
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:36,158
to worry about without having
a Queen in bed nagging me.

203
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,263
Widow. Widow. That's all I hear.

204
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:40,160
A king worrying about a widow.

205
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,529
Not a widow. The widow.

206
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:43,896
The richest widow in the world.

207
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:44,897
In Europe.

208
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:47,900
Well, anyhow, she owns more than
half of Marshovia.

209
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,167
Do you realize that she is
in every cow

210
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,107
in the country for 52 percent?

211
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:57,242
But you belong to me,
don't you, darling?

212
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:01,782
Read this telegraph from
our ambassador in Paris.

213
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:08,154
Widow sensation in Paris.

214
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:12,423
Fortune hunters are arriving
daily. Marriage in the air.

215
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:14,862
Unless Marshovia acts quickly,

216
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,697
fear national fortune goes into
foreign hands.

217
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:23,365
I know what to do
but am too old to do it.

218
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:27,609
Darling, how late do you think
you'll be denied?

219
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,443
Now,
let me pump this into your head.

220
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:32,812
You and I are living on her taxes.

221
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,179
If she doesn't come back,

222
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,809
if she withdraws her money from
the country,

223
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:37,383
the National Bank will close.

224
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,081
The country goes bankrupt.

225
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:40,555
There will be a revolution.

226
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,853
Then we'll be trampled from
our throne.

227
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:44,622
Ugly. Something must be done.

228
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:46,253
Something will be done.

229
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:48,889
And tonight. This is a secret.

230
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,136
The cabinet figures that we have
to meet foreign competition.

231
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:55,434
Therefore,
we're sending a special envoy.

232
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,735
A real man who is not too old.

233
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:58,740
And knows what to do.

234
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,037
Of course.

235
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,771
The man must be charming,
irresistible.

236
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,206
So she falls in love with him.

237
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,248
And he brings her back to
Marshovia.

238
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,149
Who are you going to send?

239
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:10,278
Well, we're considering
Count Gabrilovetch.

240
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:11,548
Gabrilovetch?

241
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,748
Now tell me.

242
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,621
If you weren't married,
if you weren't my wife,

243
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,229
could you fall for Gabrilovetch?

244
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:19,591
If I weren't married,

245
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,393
if I have to do over again and
have the choice

246
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:26,265
between you and Gabrilovetch,
frankly, I'll take you.

247
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,873
That shows you
how I think of Gabrilovetch.

248
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,210
He's out.

249
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:33,538
Who else have you got?

250
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,840
Well, there's Gabrilovetch,
Jerjosh and Mentroloski.

251
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,547
I'll still take you.

252
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:39,241
Oh, you'll have to
do better than that.

253
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:42,353
That's what I say,
but the Prime Minister,

254
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:44,387
he depends too much on
his wife's judgment.

255
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:49,290
But I say no politics at a time
like this. Let the best man win.

256
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,554
That's what the meeting is for.

257
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:52,596
I'm expecting a real fight.

258
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:56,724
Darling, do you think
it will take you all night?

259
00:23:56,868 --> 00:24:00,167
And I could have married
the sultan's daughter.

260
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:01,772
Good night, dear.

261
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:33,822
Please, I beg of you.

262
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:36,160
Control yourself.

263
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:37,290
And you, too.

264
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:39,336
I never shriek, your Majesty.

265
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,200
Walls have ears.

266
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,739
You think your servants
hide anything?

267
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,102
Oh. My good name.

268
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:47,341
Your Majesty,
may I make a suggestion?

269
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,446
What is it?

270
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,808
Let's fool them.

271
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,745
Let's make a rich conversation.

272
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,373
Let's pretend to be social.

273
00:25:53,518 --> 00:26:00,082
Right.

274
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,023
I'll take my hat off you,
your majesty.

275
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,497
We're having a good time.

276
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:10,123
Fine. Fine.

277
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:11,064
That's enough.

278
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:12,534
Let's not make a big win.

279
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:15,572
That'll settle
the servant problem

280
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:50,331
Now, let's keep this scandal
between you and you and me.

281
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:52,875
This must be kept out of history.

282
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,842
Not a soul must know.

283
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,777
Nobody. I swear, not a soul.

284
00:26:56,915 --> 00:27:00,476
We were planning not even to tell
your majesty, isn't that right?

285
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,610
That's the spirit.

286
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:06,823
Now listen, you.

287
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,558
Be careful.

288
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:12,724
A firing squad is
too good for you.

289
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,832
Tonight,
you'll be taken to the mountains.

290
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,797
First, your ears will be cut off.

291
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,781
I'll attend to you later.

292
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:39,254
Yes, master.

293
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,269
No. No, Dolores. That's not right

294
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:58,501
You know well enough that

295
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:00,042
I have to go down in history
as Augment the Great.

296
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,139
And how do you cooperate?

297
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:07,411
Falling in love with the Captain
of the Guard. Oh.

298
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,383
That's hitting below the crown.

299
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,647
You're wrong, Augment.

300
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:11,653
You're wrong.

301
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,017
I didn't fall in love.

302
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:16,154
I was defending myself
and splendidly,

303
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:17,625
but you came back too early.

304
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:19,229
You didn't give me a chance.

305
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,422
If you have return an hour later,

306
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:24,331
you'd have found him where
he belongs, outside the door.

307
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:26,528
How does he compare with
Gabrilovetch?

308
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,832
No comparison, but Gabrilovetch,

309
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:30,771
Zinchovitch together
and what have you?

310
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:38,608
Gabrilovetch and Zinchovitch,
but Danilo, no, no comparison.

311
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,478
Dolores.

312
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:41,085
Yes, Augment.

313
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:46,714
With my brains and your contacts,
Marshovia can't miss.

314
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:06,477
Afraid of me?

315
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:09,007
Ever live in Paris?

316
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:11,081
Oh, I spent all my holidays there,
your majesty.

317
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:13,343
Oh. So you know Paris.

318
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:15,316
Do you want some other lass,
your majesty?

319
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:19,617
No. No. I'm a married man.

320
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,417
Are you married?

321
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,491
No, your majesty.

322
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:22,718
You don't know
what you're missing.

323
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:24,590
Don't I? No, you don't.

324
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:26,424
Your majesty,
may I make a suggestion?

325
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:27,554
Please.

326
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:29,166
Let's drop the matter.

327
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:31,826
Fine. Now listen, my good fellow

328
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:33,764
You will leave tomorrow for Paris

329
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,463
Oh, thank you, your majesty.

330
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,542
On a secret mission that's right
up your boulevard.

331
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:40,406
Please, your majesty.

332
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:41,569
How is your French?

333
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:45,080
Terrific. (French)

334
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:48,212
Not bad. What does it mean?

335
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:50,787
Oh, I was just saying something
about her majesty the Queen.

336
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:51,817
Was it nice?

337
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,249
Lovely, isn't she.

338
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:56,292
Marvelous.

339
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,193
You will leave immediately.

340
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:00,229
Yes, your majesty.

341
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:01,855
As soon as you arrive in Paris,

342
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:04,567
you will report to
the Marshovia embassy.

343
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:08,366
Our ambassador, Baron Bafbaf
will tell you the next move.

344
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:14,172
Your majesty, whatever my mission
will be, Marshovia, right or wrong,

345
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:18,408
I'll never forget your face
when you walk into that room.

346
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,414
Did I frighten you?

347
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:20,779
Oh.

348
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:24,180
Goodbye, my majesty.

349
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,687
Goodbye, my boy.

350
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:05,463
What's new?

351
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:07,497
I overheard two girls
on the streetcar.

352
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:08,758
They were talking about you.

353
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,764
What did they say?

354
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:11,835
They were telling stories
about you.

355
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:13,104
Were they funny?

356
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:14,296
Well, they must have been.

357
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:17,101
You see, I don't understand French
but the conductor did,

358
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,073
so he stop the car
and throw them out.

359
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,239
That's Paris.

360
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,813
City of girls on
their own private.

361
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:26,075
I'm going to Maxim's.

362
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,809
But aren't you going to report
to the embassy, sir.

363
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:31,111
Tomorrow morning.
I'm going to Maxim's.

364
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:31,881
But, sir.

365
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:36,092
I'm going to Maxim's,
where all the girls are queens.

366
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:41,556
Each kiss goes on the wine list
and mine is quite a fine list.

367
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:46,364
Lolo, Dodo, Juju, Cloclo,
Mango, Crucru.

368
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:52,875
We promise to be faithful
until the night is through.

369
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:11,558
A melody of laughter,
loud and many times,

370
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:14,756
that is laugh with many times.

371
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:17,390
My dear, my friend, my lover

372
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:21,096
and you soon will enrapture
the eye of each cavalier.

373
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:23,870
Yes, ma'am.

374
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:25,335
I'll be ready in a moment.

375
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:27,502
Thank you, madam.

376
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:29,738
Around a lei of roses,

377
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:34,784
wine and dances, manly glances,
sideway glances.

378
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:38,411
Once again, I will...

379
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:39,420
Gentlemen?

380
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:40,546
Yes, madam.

381
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:41,886
What are your plans for
the evening?

382
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:44,388
We'll go to Cait d'Pate to dine,
then to the opera.

383
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:45,587
We should get there at nine.

384
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:46,822
Then a late supper
at the Grand Hotel.

385
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,565
When it's midnight
and all is well,

386
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,136
then we'll dance,
if you're willing.

387
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:55,865
How mad, how wild, how thrilling.

388
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:04,140
I'm going to Maxim's,
where all the girls are queens,

389
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:06,182
Each kiss goes on the wine list
and mine is quite a fine list.

390
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,114
Close the window.

391
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,057
Oh, why don't you...

392
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:24,862
I'll stay on at Maxim's
until the morning beams,

393
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,503
when I am feeling so good be sure
I'm out for no good.

394
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,072
Lolo, Dodo, Juju, Cloclo, Mango,
Crucru.

395
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:31,872
Wake your young man, please do.
Come on.

396
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,843
Don't spare the horses
and drive me to Maxim's.

397
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,481
Where is he going?
What did he say?

398
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:39,344
I think he said Maxim's.

399
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:41,145
He's going there it seems.

400
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:45,313
I heard that's where a man
can see ladies dance the can-can.

401
00:33:53,898 --> 00:34:00,394
Lolo, Dodo, Juju,
or any name will do.

402
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:06,306
True love is on a thousand
and the best one goes to Maxim's.

403
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:19,683
We can't go to Maxim's.

404
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:21,189
Not in my wildest dream.

405
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:24,352
There's nothing shown there and
we are too unknown there.

406
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:28,591
Lolo, Dodo, Juju, Cloclo,
Mango, Crucru,

407
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:32,464
we promise to be faithful
until the night is true.

408
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:27,849
Danilo.

409
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,524
Lulu.

410
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,790
Count Danilo.

411
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:35,399
Lulu. Please.

412
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,168
Did you say something?

413
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:44,707
No.

414
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:46,241
You better not.

415
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:51,444
Are you looking for trouble?

416
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:54,073
No Good.

417
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:58,481
What if I am looking for trouble?

418
00:35:58,623 --> 00:35:59,521
Oh, shut up.

419
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:00,487
I won't shut up.

420
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:01,751
Go home, you old fool.

421
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,186
Pig.

422
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,522
Idiot.

423
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:10,832
Stop. How dare you?

424
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:33,279
My seconds will call on you,
monsieur.

425
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:34,721
Very well, monsieur.

426
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:06,646
I wouldn't bother.

427
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:12,358
Now, listen.

428
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:24,668
Who is that old goat?

429
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:26,367
He's some ambassador from, ah...

430
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:28,103
You understand.

431
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:32,583
This whole thing is a government
secret of the highest importance.

432
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,150
Yes, your excellency.

433
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:35,411
Well. Tomorrow night, the embassy

434
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:37,680
is giving a big reception in
her honor.

435
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:39,312
Does she see well off?

436
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:40,481
No. No. No. No.

437
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:41,785
Is she beautiful?

438
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:46,291
She owns fifty-two percent of
Marshovia so she is beautiful.

439
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:49,457
If you like her or not,
you love her.

440
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,433
This is called patriotism.

441
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,368
Have you ever had diplomatic
relations with a woman?

442
00:37:55,506 --> 00:38:02,469
Oh, well. Anyhow, these are
the plans for tomorrow night.

443
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,740
Before you arrive,
she must have a very dull time,

444
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:07,146
so that you can shine by contrast

445
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:11,745
Therefore, for the first half hour
I will entertain her personally.

446
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:13,785
After listening to me for
15 minutes,

447
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:15,756
she will be completely bored.

448
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:19,624
Then we dance, after five minutes
dancing with me,

449
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,425
widow needs fresh air.

450
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:23,033
Exit to garden.

451
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:26,659
Now, and now,
she gets the big thrill.

452
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,135
I leave her.

453
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:29,762
She's alone in the garden.

454
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:31,272
It'll be a moonlight night.

455
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:32,637
I'll see to that.

456
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:34,244
I mean, it'll look like it.

457
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:39,111
And the next thing,
you come over the garden wall.

458
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,686
Danilo. Danilo.

459
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,812
How are you? How are you?
Oh, fine.

460
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,567
Danilo.

461
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:03,264
How are you?

462
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,286
Danilo. Danilo. Danny.

463
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,182
Danilo.

464
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:25,056
Stay here or I'll kill you.

465
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,663
I don't like her.

466
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:30,833
I once have a wonderful girl.

467
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:33,061
Girls. Girls.
It's good to be back.

468
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,530
Mimi, Gigi, Pipi, Fufu.

469
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,575
Do you still have that
frightful chauffeur?

470
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,768
With all the cushions.

471
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:43,842
Good. Juju, Dodo, Miji,

472
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,308
I gained five pounds.

473
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:46,677
They're all mine.

474
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:49,282
And Margo.

475
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,412
Margo with the same sweet dimple.

476
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,081
How's your young lady?
Still grouching?

477
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,083
A- ha.

478
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,058
And Gaches,
are your garter still blue?

479
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,122
Baby blue.

480
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:04,191
Do you still cry
when you love somebody?

481
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:08,669
Did you miss me, girls?

482
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:09,795
Yes.

483
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:11,165
And I miss you.

484
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:14,574
All of you, Mimi, Kiki, Fufu.

485
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,444
Oh, it's great to be loved.

486
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,450
Just a minute.

487
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,905
Don't stand in the entrance.

488
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:42,835
Go over to table fifteen.

489
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,471
Order lots of champagne.

490
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,373
Any Americans here tonight?

491
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,580
I don't know.

492
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:57,210
Peculiar, ha?

493
00:40:57,355 --> 00:40:58,413
Bother?

494
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:05,529
Look who's here. Danilo.

495
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:08,325
There are girls in the wild
and its wet.

496
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,264
There's two things that
we live to regret.

497
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:14,200
Let me dance till
the restaurant's close.

498
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:17,239
With the girls, girls, girls,
girls, girls.

499
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:20,105
Where there's wine
and women and song.

500
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:23,111
It is wrong not to
do something wrong.

501
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:26,148
When you do something wrong,
you must do something right.

502
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:28,775
And I'm doing it right tonight.

503
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:36,351
I say.

504
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,890
Oh, terrific.

505
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:43,864
Remember, last year?

506
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,229
Do I.

507
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:46,461
Oh.

508
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:55,440
Pretty, isn't it?

509
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,137
He gave it to me.

510
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:12,557
Not bad. Who's she?

511
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:13,629
She's new here.

512
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:15,595
What's your name, deary?

513
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,328
Fifi.

514
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:19,834
Well, Fifi.

515
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:22,664
Who is he?

516
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:26,834
Don't you know me?
She doesn't know me.

517
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,306
You don't know him?

518
00:42:30,448 --> 00:42:32,109
No.

519
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:33,807
It's Danilo.

520
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:37,443
Danilo? Wait a minute.

521
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:40,148
Aren't you the man
who gave me this bracelet?

522
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:41,258
Oh, listen.

523
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,622
If I gave you the bracelet,
you'd remember it.

524
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:46,753
And besides, he doesn't give
any bracelets.

525
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,131
Shall we sit down?

526
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:56,296
Well, there's not much going on
here tonight.

527
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:01,139
You're Americans.
Are you a banker?

528
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:02,540
No.

529
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,778
I was just in a mood for banker.

530
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:07,815
You understand, don't you?

531
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:10,246
Sure. Sure.

532
00:43:10,388 --> 00:43:11,514
I didn't mean to
hurt your feeling.

533
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,589
It's alright. Really.

534
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:23,093
Not bad. Come on.

535
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:33,575
Sit down. Waiter.

536
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:38,843
Yes, madam.

537
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,344
Lots of champagne.

538
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:42,384
Yes, madam.

539
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:51,225
You're the freshest Fifi
I ever met.

540
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:53,592
I am nice Fifi.

541
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:55,528
How nice?

542
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,429
Not too nice.

543
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:01,263
Your right eye says yes
and your left eye says no.

544
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:04,306
Fifi, you're cockeyed.

545
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:05,841
Quite right.

546
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:09,078
For instance, at the moment,
I'm looking at someone else,

547
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:13,616
and what's more,
let go of my hands.

548
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:18,849
You're charming,
fascinating, delightful.

549
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,783
Stop kicking me.

550
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:25,084
Stop pinching me. That's better.

551
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:28,793
Now, you're behaving
like a gentleman.

552
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,299
Give me back my shoe.

553
00:45:14,612 --> 00:45:19,345
Girls on my table don't look at
other men, you understand?

554
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,508
I'm not your slave.

555
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:23,813
After all, we're living in 1885.

556
00:45:23,954 --> 00:45:25,148
Shut up.

557
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,611
Constantinople.

558
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:05,756
Number seven.

559
00:46:09,033 --> 00:46:09,761
Where?

560
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,232
To the private dining room

561
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:15,736
Oh, no. I never go to
private dining rooms.

562
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:18,307
I don't want to act the lady but...

563
00:47:06,724 --> 00:47:08,692
May I put it down?

564
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:09,815
Please.

565
00:48:06,684 --> 00:48:12,316
And now, Fifi, if you feel in
the mood for banker,

566
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:14,720
the door is not lock.

567
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:17,586
What's the matter?

568
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:20,189
Great man.

569
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:24,454
His only mistake was he attacked
too early.

570
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,059
That's how I lost Waterloo.

571
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:30,689
Oh, now, listen.
I want mine to be kissing.

572
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:32,392
I want to enjoy sometime,

573
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:35,334
but this is absolutely
demoralizing you.

574
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,838
First, it's the Turk,
now it's Napoleon.

575
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:39,666
Well, I'll give you Napoleon.

576
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,368
You can have him all night,

577
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:46,172
and see if you can see his head
off the second button.

578
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,118
Anything wrong?

579
00:49:53,257 --> 00:49:54,588
Now it's impossible.

580
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:57,819
I take her upstairs and just
when I am about to be nice to her

581
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:00,562
she stops to
talk about another man.

582
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:07,126
Shame on you.

583
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:12,138
Why, the girl has
no etiquette. Come on.

584
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:33,661
Would you like to dance?

585
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:35,321
No.

586
00:51:54,511 --> 00:52:04,352
Not a word. Have I hurt you?
Yet I know.

587
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:13,795
You have not told me,
but you hold me for I know.

588
00:52:14,097 --> 00:52:20,161
Words I haven't spoken,
yet I know you hear.

589
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:32,511
Music find your heart's reply
I love you, dear.

590
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,788
Danilo.

591
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:19,520
Yes, Fifi.

592
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:21,153
Do you love me?

593
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:23,789
Certainly. Why not?

594
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,363
Oh, you don't understand.

595
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:31,770
I mean, do you love me?

596
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:34,103
Forever.

597
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:40,714
How long is forever with you?

598
00:53:40,851 --> 00:53:43,684
What a funny question?

599
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:45,583
Has nobody asked you that before?

600
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:48,714
Oh, not at Maxim's.

601
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,392
You like Maxim's girls best,
don't you?

602
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:54,326
Of course, I do.

603
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:59,265
Where in the world can you find
girls so beautiful, so charming,

604
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:05,069
who can dance like you, girl,
who can smile like you.

605
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:11,279
Ah, you're wonderful.

606
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:16,443
And let me tell you something,
Fifi. Stay just what you are.

607
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:20,044
Have you met a society woman?

608
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,384
Never.

609
00:54:21,525 --> 00:54:24,085
Well, you haven't miss a thing.

610
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,854
You don't like ladies?

611
00:54:27,164 --> 00:54:29,394
Yes. Yes, I like them.

612
00:54:29,533 --> 00:54:33,833
They are nice but they take love
too seriously.

613
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:37,462
They can't enjoy it without
bothering about tomorrow.

614
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:40,098
You mean,
they're hard to get rid off.

615
00:54:41,078 --> 00:54:46,812
Right. And the silly questions
they asked. Do you love me?

616
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:51,250
And then you have to lie, yes,
certainly, of course.

617
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:56,121
And then they'll ask you again,
do you really love me?

618
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:58,124
No, really...

619
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:12,441
Oh. Well, may I ask who you are?

620
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:17,280
Just one of those women
who ask silly questions,

621
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:21,717
and then you have to lie.

622
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:27,818
Do you still want me to stay?

623
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:31,724
Oh, I wouldn't let you go for
anything in the world.

624
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:40,165
But, what if I should bother you
tomorrow,

625
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:44,603
what if I should be hard to
get rid off?

626
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:49,111
Darling...

627
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:51,569
Is that all you can say?

628
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:53,683
No.

629
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:55,478
A very clear answer.

630
00:55:55,619 --> 00:55:57,814
No, Fifi.

631
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:00,021
Fifi. That's all you really want.

632
00:56:00,991 --> 00:56:05,018
That's all women is to you.
Your Fifi. You great lover.

633
00:56:05,996 --> 00:56:06,792
Oh, please.

634
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:08,158
You don't even know what love is.

635
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:10,357
Please. Please.
Don't spoil this evening.

636
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,230
Spoil this evening, oh no, I won't.

637
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,806
You came here to have
a great time, didn't you?

638
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,237
Well, you'll have it.

639
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,172
You won't be cheated.

640
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:28,247
Kiki, Margo, Cloclo, Marsel.

641
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,285
Now, listen.

642
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:38,418
Girls, the gentleman wants to
be entertained.

643
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:45,094
Here they are.

644
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:50,434
All your little tonight
and not a tomorrow among them.

645
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:05,253
Goodnight, deary.
I deserve your scolding.

646
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:07,652
I should have known better.

647
00:57:33,984 --> 00:57:37,249
Goodbye to you, Maxim's.

648
00:57:37,387 --> 00:57:40,447
I've got to live in dream.

649
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:46,024
You give me what a splendid,
but now the game has ended.

650
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:52,795
I give you to Zuzu, Cloclo, Margo
Crucru, but I have lost its spirit

651
00:57:57,941 --> 00:58:07,612
I leave Maxim's to you.

652
00:58:54,964 --> 00:59:01,893
I could not believe it all,
but that's all widows are given.

653
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:05,838
And if you're poor ones
or the rich ones,

654
00:59:05,975 --> 00:59:10,309
we much more attractive that way.

655
00:59:10,447 --> 00:59:15,976
We are a widow, a merry widow,
a merry widow, like as before.

656
00:59:31,368 --> 00:59:31,629
Where is Captain Danilo?

657
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:35,230
He, ah...
Don't lie to me. Where is he?

658
00:59:35,372 --> 00:59:37,101
He left.

659
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,707
He left?

660
00:59:38,842 --> 00:59:39,638
He left.

661
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:40,674
How long ago?

662
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:41,868
Yesterday.

663
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:43,979
You mean he hasn't come back
since last night?

664
00:59:44,114 --> 00:59:45,012
Yes, sir.

665
00:59:45,148 --> 00:59:50,085
Oh. Oh. Oh, dear, dear.

666
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:52,120
What am I going to do with her?

667
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:53,222
Please, don't kill her.

668
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:54,254
Forgive her, sir.

669
00:59:54,391 --> 00:59:55,653
I'm sure
she can explain everything.

670
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:57,320
Who?

671
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:58,688
Your wife, sir.

672
00:59:58,828 --> 00:59:59,852
Who do you think I am?

673
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:01,429
The husband, aren't you?

674
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:04,199
I am the Marshovian ambassador.

675
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:05,301
Oh. Then I must tell the truth.

676
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,663
Yes, what is it?

677
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:09,397
Captain Danilo left last night
and he hasn't come back.

678
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:12,402
Oh. What will I do?

679
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:13,937
What will I do?

680
01:00:14,077 --> 01:00:16,409
If you don't mind, sir,
I still say forgive her.

681
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:18,443
I'm not married.

682
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:19,445
I'm not looking for my wife.

683
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:21,410
I'm looking for Captain Danilo.

684
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:22,677
Where is he?

685
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:25,413
Your excellency,
you may think I'm stubborn,

686
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:28,956
but he left last night
and he hasn't come back.

687
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:29,990
You find him.

688
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:33,425
You go to every nightclub,
every cafe, every... Here.

689
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:34,822
Here are some addresses.

690
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,955
If Captain Danilo doesn't appear
immediately here in the embassy,

691
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:38,465
he'll be court marshaled

692
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:39,932
Oh, yes, your excellency.

693
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:42,731
Listen.
Don't you lose those addresses.

694
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:44,203
No, your excellency.

695
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:37,418
Captain. Captain. It's me.

696
01:01:37,727 --> 01:01:40,218
Miska, Captain. Miska.

697
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:44,732
Yes. Your uniform. Uniform.

698
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:47,894
Uniform for your captain.

699
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:53,309
Embassy.

700
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:55,434
Court marshal, captain.

701
01:01:56,346 --> 01:02:03,775
Nice, captain.
Nice, captain. Nice, captain.

702
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,788
He won't let me put on
his uniform.

703
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:15,797
Danilo...

704
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:18,264
No...

705
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:40,889
Come on, hush.

706
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:43,182
Hush.

707
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:50,722
No... I'm not going
to make love to that widow.

708
01:02:50,867 --> 01:02:53,131
Can you imagine ordering someone
to make love?

709
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:54,167
That's the army.

710
01:02:54,304 --> 01:02:55,271
I never heard of such a thing

711
01:02:55,405 --> 01:02:57,134
and I've been with
the army all my live.

712
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:58,740
Do you have to marry her, Danilo?

713
01:02:58,875 --> 01:02:59,569
It's a secret.

714
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:00,232
Don't tell it, Captain.

715
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:01,638
It's a secret.

716
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:08,741
If I don't marry her, Marshovia,
Marshovia will be bankrupt.

717
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:10,318
That's a secret, too.

718
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,318
And I'm not going to tell you.

719
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,923
He'll be court marshaled
if he did not go.

720
01:03:15,058 --> 01:03:18,459
Fifi. Where are you, Fifi?

721
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:20,422
If she really loves you,
she'll come back,

722
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:22,357
but she's not a lady.

723
01:03:22,498 --> 01:03:25,092
I once knew a lady
who came back twice.

724
01:03:25,234 --> 01:03:28,761
Alright. Alright. I'm not going.

725
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:30,372
He's going to be shot.

726
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:31,905
Please tell him to go
to the embassy.

727
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:35,670
No, I won't. I won't.

728
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:39,043
Maxim's. That's where Fifi is.

729
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:41,707
I'm going to Maxim's
and nothing can stop me.

730
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:43,709
Yes.

731
01:03:43,853 --> 01:03:46,253
I'm going to Maxim's.

732
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:23,887
Any news?

733
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:25,324
No, your excellency.

734
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:27,896
Is this him?

735
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:30,864
No. No. No. Didn't I tell you
exactly what he looks like?

736
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,058
Yes, sir.

737
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:34,795
Oh. Just a moment. Don't...

738
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:10,697
I'm not going to make love with
that widow.

739
01:05:12,442 --> 01:05:13,409
Another a cup of coffee.

740
01:05:13,543 --> 01:05:14,840
I'm perfectly sober.
Drink it.

741
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:16,444
I'm in full possession of
all my sanity.

742
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:17,508
Drink it.

743
01:05:17,613 --> 01:05:18,671
But I'm not going to make love
with the widow.

744
01:05:18,815 --> 01:05:19,679
Drink that coffee.

745
01:05:19,816 --> 01:05:20,646
I'm in love with another woman.

746
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:22,311
Who is she?

747
01:05:22,452 --> 01:05:23,248
I don't know.

748
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:24,182
Drink that coffee.

749
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,016
No. Drink that coffee.

750
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:29,784
I'm a soldier. I'm an officer.

751
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,257
My duty is to fight.

752
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:33,692
I'm willing to die on
every battlefield,

753
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:36,458
but I'm not going to drink
another cup of coffee.

754
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:39,159
In the name of his majesty,
King Augment the Second,

755
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:40,701
Commander-in-Chief of the Army,

756
01:05:40,837 --> 01:05:44,204
High Admiral of the Navy,
drink that coffee.

757
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:55,247
Now, you stay here
and face the widow.

758
01:06:49,639 --> 01:06:51,402
And now, we come to
the room, madam,

759
01:06:51,707 --> 01:06:53,868
where King Augment say
to Queen Dolores

760
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:58,879
for the first time,
the historic words "I love you".

761
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:04,611
Please, madam.

762
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:26,371
Well. What a surprise.
Captain Danilo.

763
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:32,179
Well, of all people.
How did you get here?

764
01:07:32,315 --> 01:07:32,679
When did you arrive?

765
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:39,349
Oh, yes, what a coincidence.
What a coincidence.

766
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:44,221
I thought he was in Marshovia.
And yes, Captain Danilo.

767
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:47,960
Madam Sonia,
may I present my dearest friend,

768
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:50,156
none other than Captain Danilo.

769
01:07:56,839 --> 01:07:59,433
What a pleasure, madam.

770
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:01,133
It is?

771
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:04,269
It's small, it's afraid.

772
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:07,905
Meeting you is the greatest good
that would happen to me.

773
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:10,712
Madam, may I ask a favor?

774
01:08:11,787 --> 01:08:14,654
Shall I lift my veil, Captain?

775
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:17,687
Oh, no, madam. No.

776
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:21,627
I don't jump over
the garden walls anymore.

777
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,322
Since when?

778
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:25,400
Since yesterday.

779
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:30,638
I fell in love with a girl madly,
but she disappeared.

780
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:34,132
And you, madam,
are the only one in the world

781
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:40,807
that can help me find her.
Her name is Fifi.

782
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:51,324
Fifi is no more. You killed her.

783
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:57,230
After she left you last night,

784
01:08:57,366 --> 01:09:00,597
she came home
and committed suicide.

785
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:05,165
She jumped into cold bath,
and you'd be surprised, Captain,

786
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:07,401
what a cold water can do.

787
01:09:21,424 --> 01:09:22,391
Just a moment.

788
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:26,786
Another telegram to his majesty.

789
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:29,921
Following his accurate statement
of happenings.

790
01:09:30,066 --> 01:09:32,660
Copy word. Introduction performed

791
01:09:32,802 --> 01:09:34,963
Widow accused Danilo of murder

792
01:09:35,104 --> 01:09:37,004
but was willing to lift veil.

793
01:09:37,139 --> 01:09:39,369
Couldn't understand the rest of
conversation as both talked

794
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:42,405
in code, and shhhh...

795
01:09:43,646 --> 01:09:47,377
At the moment, both are standing
in the garden door.

796
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:50,417
If he could only get her into
the garden,

797
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:53,018
he whisper something in her ear.

798
01:09:53,155 --> 01:09:55,953
Apparently, something nice.

799
01:09:56,092 --> 01:09:59,858
She gets very angry
in fact, she's furious.

800
01:09:59,996 --> 01:10:01,896
She opens the garden door.

801
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:04,090
She goes into the garden.

802
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:08,897
He follows.
Victory. Victory. Victory.

803
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:11,268
I love you, Sonia.

804
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:12,965
Well, I noticed it last night.

805
01:10:13,109 --> 01:10:16,306
Oh, please. I'm mad about you.

806
01:10:16,445 --> 01:10:17,912
Everybody is.

807
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:20,345
I've heard it at least
a hundred times tonight,

808
01:10:20,483 --> 01:10:23,418
and everybody wants to marry me.

809
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:26,316
There must be something wonderful
about me.

810
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:29,083
What is it that fascinate
all these men?

811
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,954
What can it be?

812
01:10:31,093 --> 01:10:40,195
Is it my charm, or my beauty, or
do you suppose it's my position?

813
01:10:40,336 --> 01:10:42,804
You mean, your money?

814
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:44,872
Yes.

815
01:10:46,108 --> 01:10:48,508
I don't know about the other men,
but with me,

816
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:51,302
it's strictly your money
and nothing else.

817
01:10:51,447 --> 01:10:52,277
I believe you.

818
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:55,009
I knew you would.
That's why I said it.

819
01:10:55,151 --> 01:10:57,483
If you have told me last night
who you were,

820
01:10:57,787 --> 01:11:02,190
if I had only know that I had in
my arms the richest widow, I'll...

821
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:07,360
What did you come to
Maxim's for anyway?

822
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:14,826
Oh, I see. Just like a man,
looking for a thrill.

823
01:11:16,505 --> 01:11:17,836
Goodbye, Captain.

824
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,689
A telegram to his majesty.

825
01:14:26,829 --> 01:14:28,729
Just came out of the strawberry.

826
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:30,923
Big doings in garden.

827
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:33,864
Overheard whole scene
but could not understand a word

828
01:14:34,003 --> 01:14:35,800
because wind was against me,

829
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:36,461
and yet...

830
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:38,433
Telegram, your excellency.

831
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:45,311
It's from his majesty.

832
01:14:45,447 --> 01:14:46,846
It's in code.

833
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:51,976
Zizipoff. Get your excellency.

834
01:15:05,067 --> 01:15:06,694
The first word is Darling.

835
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:07,631
What does it mean?

836
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:10,034
D...

837
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:16,041
Da... Da... Darling,

838
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:21,445
I consider you the greatest idiot
in the diplomatic service.

839
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:32,425
What is the next word,
your excellency?

840
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:39,896
Lilac time.

841
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:42,265
Lilac time.

842
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:53,144
Azratevitch.

843
01:15:53,282 --> 01:15:53,680
Yes, your excellency.

844
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:56,379
Go to my bedroom.

845
01:15:56,518 --> 01:15:59,453
In the cabinet behind
his majesty's picture,

846
01:15:59,588 --> 01:16:01,681
there's a little brown bottle
of poison.

847
01:16:01,824 --> 01:16:04,884
Throw it away.
It's protective measure.

848
01:16:05,027 --> 01:16:06,426
Yes, your excellency.

849
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:17,170
Read it again, slowly.

850
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:22,437
I consider you the greatest idiot
in the diplomatic service.

851
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:24,409
A diplomat who does not know

852
01:16:24,713 --> 01:16:27,648
what is going on under
his very roof is unfit

853
01:16:28,617 --> 01:16:31,347
to be under the lower name
of Potpot.

854
01:16:31,487 --> 01:16:33,318
It is hard to believe that

855
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:36,652
you are the son of
the great statesman, Potpot.

856
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:44,361
But, Potpot or no Potpot,
I consider you the greatest idiot

857
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:48,300
in the diplomatic service.
Now, listen, Potpot.

858
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,701
Danilo gives secret away to
Maxim's girls,

859
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:52,697
secret all over terrace.

860
01:16:53,675 --> 01:16:58,476
Local Marshovian newspapers read
information by telegraph.

861
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:02,778
Opposition paper will print story
tomorrow. Speedo.

862
01:17:02,918 --> 01:17:06,684
Bring forth the marriage
or everything lost.

863
01:17:06,822 --> 01:17:09,382
She must be married tonight.

864
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:11,784
Therefore, act quickly.

865
01:17:11,927 --> 01:17:13,758
Be brilliant, be creative.

866
01:17:13,896 --> 01:17:15,193
Kill umas. Admit nothing.

867
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:17,161
Deny everything. Avail crisis.

868
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:19,164
Face fact. Stand fast.

869
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:21,826
Something lost
if we don't do it now.

870
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:26,339
What are you waiting for. Augment

871
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:34,240
You still like Maxim's girls?

872
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:37,443
I love you and only you, darling.

873
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:39,247
Please believe me.

874
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:40,252
Danilo.

875
01:17:40,389 --> 01:17:42,914
Ask me anything you want.

876
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:44,457
All my silly questions?

877
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:48,196
Yes. About tomorrow,
about all the days after tomorrow

878
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:51,060
Ask me anything, everything.

879
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:54,692
But please, believe me.

880
01:17:54,837 --> 01:18:00,002
I do believe you because
I want to believe you.

881
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:02,672
Ladies. Ladies and gentlemen.

882
01:18:02,811 --> 01:18:05,041
I have to honor to announce
the coming marriage

883
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:07,671
and the present engagement of
the charming Marshovian lady,

884
01:18:07,816 --> 01:18:09,010
Madam Sonia,

885
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:12,609
and our own Captain Danilo,
captain of the royal guard.

886
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:13,982
It's a love match.

887
01:18:14,122 --> 01:18:16,352
How does he know?

888
01:18:16,492 --> 01:18:19,655
How does anyone know except you
and me?

889
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:20,784
Darling.

890
01:18:20,929 --> 01:18:22,294
Captain Danilo,

891
01:18:22,431 --> 01:18:24,422
would you be good enough to come
to his excellency immediately?

892
01:18:24,733 --> 01:18:26,132
Sonia.

893
01:18:26,268 --> 01:18:28,327
Yes, Danilo?

894
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:30,631
Would you wait here for me?

895
01:18:30,772 --> 01:18:32,330
Of course.

896
01:18:44,353 --> 01:18:46,446
Your excellency, how dare you
made such an announcement.

897
01:18:46,755 --> 01:18:47,380
How dare you.

898
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:48,713
Do you know whom you're talking?

899
01:18:48,857 --> 01:18:50,722
To the biggest idiot.

900
01:18:50,859 --> 01:18:52,326
You read the telegram.

901
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:53,428
What telegram?

902
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:58,860
Here. Here. Read it.
It's unbelievable.

903
01:18:59,001 --> 01:19:00,400
An officer giving away
a government secret

904
01:19:00,702 --> 01:19:02,636
to a lot of Maxim's girls.
All Paris knows this.

905
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:05,163
Tomorrow,
it'll be in all the papers.

906
01:19:05,307 --> 01:19:07,741
If the widow ever finds out that
this is a conspiracy,

907
01:19:07,876 --> 01:19:09,241
that the government sends you here

908
01:19:09,378 --> 01:19:10,777
she'll call off the marriage,

909
01:19:10,913 --> 01:19:13,279
and the next thing she'll take
her money out of Marshovia,

910
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:15,110
then where will we be?

911
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:17,013
You have to marry her tonight.

912
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:19,347
Act quickly, be brilliant.

913
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:24,389
Act quickly, meet crisis,
deny everything, stand fast.

914
01:19:24,526 --> 01:19:25,754
Something must be done.

915
01:19:25,894 --> 01:19:29,694
Do it. Do it now.
What are you waiting for?

916
01:19:29,831 --> 01:19:31,662
Your excellency. Shut up.

917
01:19:55,257 --> 01:19:57,691
Sonia, you're crying.

918
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:02,357
I'm crying because I'm happy.

919
01:20:02,497 --> 01:20:04,431
Why shouldn't I be happy?

920
01:20:06,168 --> 01:20:06,964
Sonia.

921
01:20:07,102 --> 01:20:09,400
Yes, Danilo.

922
01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:12,473
There is something,
something I must tell you.

923
01:20:12,774 --> 01:20:16,733
Please. Just a moment.

924
01:20:47,976 --> 01:20:49,204
You love me, don't you?

925
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:51,437
Yes, I do. I do love you.

926
01:20:51,747 --> 01:20:53,738
You don't have to convince me.

927
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:56,112
I know it, and the Maxim's girls,

928
01:20:56,251 --> 01:21:01,382
all Paris, the whole world,
everybody knows you love me.

929
01:21:02,457 --> 01:21:06,086
And everybody knows why.

930
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:10,865
Well, Captain, go ahead,
I'm waiting.

931
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:12,967
I love to hear you lie.

932
01:21:17,005 --> 01:21:20,805
Have you nothing to say to me?

933
01:21:20,942 --> 01:21:24,207
Nothing, madam,
that you would believe.

934
01:21:26,982 --> 01:21:28,472
Goodbye, Captain.

935
01:21:41,163 --> 01:21:42,130
Congratulations.

936
01:21:42,264 --> 01:21:44,425
Ladies and gentlemen.

937
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:48,002
I wish to correct
a misunderstanding.

938
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:50,195
The announcement of
Madam's engagement

939
01:21:50,338 --> 01:21:53,739
has been made without
Madam's knowledge or consent.

940
01:21:54,710 --> 01:21:56,234
I am speaking for Madam Sonia

941
01:21:56,378 --> 01:21:58,209
when I said Madam
has never entertained

942
01:21:58,346 --> 01:22:01,281
the slightest thought of
such an engagement.

943
01:22:15,464 --> 01:22:19,230
Madam, there is nothing left
to be said.

944
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:21,426
I shall make no attempt
to explain.

945
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:23,697
I know it's all over.

946
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:27,665
There's only one thing I want to
say before I go.

947
01:22:28,643 --> 01:22:32,170
I love you, Fifi.

948
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:35,978
Now, what do you expect me to do?

949
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:38,780
Fall in your arms?

950
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:41,150
Marshovia has elected
the right man.

951
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:44,816
You're brilliant, Captain,
too brilliant.

952
01:22:56,438 --> 01:22:57,462
Sorry, Captain.

953
01:22:57,773 --> 01:23:00,071
In the name of your majesty,
you're under arrest.

954
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:02,369
You leave for
Marshovia immediately.

955
01:23:06,548 --> 01:23:09,312
Well, gentlemen, shall we dance?

956
01:23:09,451 --> 01:23:11,681
Oh, please, madam.

957
01:23:15,323 --> 01:23:17,985
Open the gate for moment,

958
01:23:18,126 --> 01:23:21,653
for gay time is in Paris
and play time

959
01:23:22,631 --> 01:23:25,293
with the man of sincerity,

960
01:23:25,433 --> 01:23:29,335
and he tells you he loves you
indefinitely.

961
01:23:34,910 --> 01:23:40,371
What a pretty thing to see,
Paris in the spring.

962
01:23:57,799 --> 01:24:01,064
High officer, Captain Danilo.

963
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:03,034
Widow has lost company.

964
01:24:03,171 --> 01:24:06,868
King denies heart attack.
King denies heart attack.

965
01:24:07,008 --> 01:24:11,172
Yes, sir.
King denies heart attack.

966
01:24:13,181 --> 01:24:15,843
Widows withdraws many
from country.

967
01:24:17,252 --> 01:24:18,241
Keep the change.

968
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:19,944
Thank you, sir.

969
01:24:20,088 --> 01:24:21,146
What are we going to do?

970
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:21,687
If the widow doesn't change
her mind,

971
01:24:22,657 --> 01:24:24,215
we can close up the country.

972
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:25,690
Oh, Dolores, Dolores.

973
01:24:26,661 --> 01:24:28,720
Looks like exile to me.

974
01:24:32,567 --> 01:24:33,363
Revolution?

975
01:24:34,636 --> 01:24:38,231
The cannon just announced
the opening of the trial.

976
01:24:38,373 --> 01:24:39,931
Thank you, Gabrilovitch.

977
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:46,805
In the name of His majesty,

978
01:24:46,948 --> 01:24:49,382
I herewith open the trial of
the State of Marshovia versus

979
01:24:49,517 --> 01:24:51,417
Captain Danilo.

980
01:24:56,391 --> 01:24:57,085
Would you be good enough

981
01:24:57,225 --> 01:24:59,750
to remove all the livestock in
the court room?

982
01:25:07,469 --> 01:25:08,868
Bring in the prisoner.

983
01:25:37,265 --> 01:25:39,324
Bring in the witnesses
and exhibits.

984
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:06,918
In the name of the State,

985
01:26:07,062 --> 01:26:10,657
I accuse Captain Danilo of
high treason, failing his duty.

986
01:26:10,799 --> 01:26:11,925
State is going to prove that

987
01:26:12,067 --> 01:26:16,436
this man who lives was always was
a madness to Marshovia,

988
01:26:16,571 --> 01:26:18,903
with no respect for the sanctity
of home,

989
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,770
not even stopping on garden walls

990
01:26:23,545 --> 01:26:25,172
Exhibit Two.

991
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:31,675
Now, generals of the jury.

992
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:32,684
I will prove this Exhibit...

993
01:26:33,655 --> 01:26:34,713
Your honor, I object.

994
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:37,347
I object this witness
being called an Exhibit.

995
01:26:37,492 --> 01:26:38,288
She's an Exhibit.

996
01:26:38,426 --> 01:26:38,790
She's a witness.

997
01:26:38,927 --> 01:26:41,259
She is not. She is.

998
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:45,423
Objection sustain.

999
01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:46,761
From now on, the prosecution

1000
01:26:46,901 --> 01:26:50,359
will refer to Exhibit Number Two
as Witness Number One.

1001
01:27:19,634 --> 01:27:22,626
Your honor, when I read
the charges against Count Danilo,

1002
01:27:23,605 --> 01:27:25,402
I realize this case concerns me,

1003
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:28,771
so I came here from Paris.

1004
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:30,741
May I have the opportunity
to testify?

1005
01:27:30,879 --> 01:27:34,178
The court appreciates
your patriotism, Madam.

1006
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:36,842
Please, Madam.

1007
01:27:43,191 --> 01:27:46,183
Madam, will you tell the generals
of the jury,

1008
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:48,420
in your own charming way,

1009
01:27:48,563 --> 01:27:50,292
everything you knew about
this case.

1010
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:55,933
As I understand it,

1011
01:27:56,071 --> 01:27:59,302
you are charging the defendant
for neglecting his duty

1012
01:27:59,441 --> 01:28:02,672
and being a traitor to his country

1013
01:28:02,811 --> 01:28:07,942
Your honor, you are accusing
an innocent man.

1014
01:28:12,754 --> 01:28:17,123
He did everything in his power to
be true to Marshovia,

1015
01:28:17,258 --> 01:28:19,920
and betrayed me.

1016
01:28:20,061 --> 01:28:21,619
Don't put him in jail.

1017
01:28:21,763 --> 01:28:24,857
Give him a medal, a monument,
set him as an example.

1018
01:28:24,999 --> 01:28:29,800
A Marshovian patriot who stopped
at nothing.

1019
01:28:34,042 --> 01:28:36,169
He did do his duty.

1020
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:38,973
He used every strategy,
every trick.

1021
01:28:39,114 --> 01:28:41,639
He lied, he deceive me,

1022
01:28:41,783 --> 01:28:45,719
he played with emotions, romance,

1023
01:28:47,188 --> 01:28:51,648
he was willing to break a woman's
heart just to proceed

1024
01:28:51,793 --> 01:28:53,693
what he is instructed.

1025
01:28:55,096 --> 01:28:59,123
Your honor, may I be permitted
to cross-examine the witness?

1026
01:28:59,267 --> 01:29:00,666
Granted.

1027
01:29:06,207 --> 01:29:08,368
Witness is yours.

1028
01:29:17,585 --> 01:29:18,916
So I lied to you.

1029
01:29:19,053 --> 01:29:19,985
Yes.

1030
01:29:20,121 --> 01:29:21,349
I was playing you games.

1031
01:29:21,489 --> 01:29:22,649
Nothing else.

1032
01:29:22,790 --> 01:29:23,381
When I danced with you,

1033
01:29:23,691 --> 01:29:24,623
I was only thinking of
your millions.

1034
01:29:25,593 --> 01:29:26,821
And when you took me in your arms

1035
01:29:26,961 --> 01:29:28,053
I was following instructions.

1036
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:29,959
Yes.

1037
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:34,729
And when I kissed you.

1038
01:29:36,905 --> 01:29:39,897
That's was the biggest lie of all

1039
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:44,368
That's all I want to know.

1040
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:48,312
I'm guilty.

1041
01:29:49,117 --> 01:29:52,644
Guilty of treason, failing in
duty, of everything you want.

1042
01:29:52,787 --> 01:29:57,850
But most of all,
I'm guilty of being your fool.

1043
01:29:57,992 --> 01:30:04,795
Once in my life, I lost both
my heart and my head.

1044
01:30:04,933 --> 01:30:09,370
Therefore, I should be punished
without mercy.

1045
01:30:09,504 --> 01:30:14,840
Let my fate be a warning to
every men, any man,

1046
01:30:14,976 --> 01:30:18,810
who can dance through life with
hundreds of women,

1047
01:30:18,947 --> 01:30:24,442
and is willing to walk through
life with one, should be hanged.

1048
01:30:56,784 --> 01:30:57,443
The widow.

1049
01:30:58,686 --> 01:30:59,744
Something must have happened
to the widow.

1050
01:30:59,887 --> 01:31:00,911
What? What? What?

1051
01:31:01,055 --> 01:31:03,819
She wants to go to jail
because of Captain Danilo.

1052
01:31:04,926 --> 01:31:06,655
I think... Quiet.

1053
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:12,459
Racheski, Gabrico.

1054
01:31:12,767 --> 01:31:13,756
Yes, your majesty.

1055
01:31:13,901 --> 01:31:14,868
My horse.

1056
01:31:15,003 --> 01:31:16,368
Yes, your majesty.

1057
01:31:25,046 --> 01:31:26,946
Now, are you a friend of
the captain, madam?

1058
01:31:27,081 --> 01:31:28,013
Not exactly.

1059
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:28,945
A relative?

1060
01:31:29,083 --> 01:31:29,913
No.

1061
01:31:30,051 --> 01:31:31,416
But you knew him before,
didn't you?

1062
01:31:31,719 --> 01:31:32,481
Oh, yes.

1063
01:31:32,787 --> 01:31:35,153
Well,
you wouldn't recognize him now.

1064
01:31:35,290 --> 01:31:37,383
He's a changed man.

1065
01:31:37,525 --> 01:31:41,120
Did you hear the story
about the warden's daughter?

1066
01:31:41,262 --> 01:31:42,126
No.

1067
01:31:42,263 --> 01:31:45,198
Well, last night,
the warden's daughter

1068
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:48,928
brought his supper personally
into his cell.

1069
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:50,037
And what happened.

1070
01:31:50,171 --> 01:31:51,297
Nothing.

1071
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:53,430
I'm telling you,
he's a changed man.

1072
01:31:53,741 --> 01:31:55,231
But here we are.

1073
01:32:03,584 --> 01:32:05,984
But, he isn't here.

1074
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:07,917
It looks that way.

1075
01:32:08,056 --> 01:32:09,284
Don't worry about that.

1076
01:32:09,424 --> 01:32:11,051
He always come back.

1077
01:32:11,192 --> 01:32:12,853
Just make yourself comfortable.

1078
01:32:21,769 --> 01:32:23,066
Danilo.

1079
01:32:25,106 --> 01:32:25,902
He's not here.

1080
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,837
When do you expect him back?

1081
01:32:27,975 --> 01:32:28,873
I don't know.

1082
01:32:29,010 --> 01:32:29,806
Well, anyway, tell him

1083
01:32:29,944 --> 01:32:32,105
there's a big party going on
in the women's ward.

1084
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:49,959
I'm sorry.
I was chased by a mouse.

1085
01:32:50,098 --> 01:32:53,192
From your estate all the way
here to the prison.

1086
01:32:53,334 --> 01:32:55,495
What a mouse.

1087
01:32:55,803 --> 01:32:56,770
You don't think I came here

1088
01:32:56,904 --> 01:32:58,963
To see me? No.

1089
01:32:59,107 --> 01:33:02,440
Yes, I came to see you and to
leave with you one message.

1090
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:05,705
Tonight, there's a party going
on in women's ward. Goodbye.

1091
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:22,327
Your majesty, not even Napoleon
could have thought of this.

1092
01:33:22,463 --> 01:33:23,862
Thank you.

1093
01:33:27,034 --> 01:33:28,763
The plan can't fail.

1094
01:33:28,903 --> 01:33:31,770
They can't get out,
that's what they're in for.

1095
01:33:31,906 --> 01:33:33,806
Now, put ourselves in their place.

1096
01:33:33,941 --> 01:33:37,035
We both have a quarrel
and now we're locked in.

1097
01:33:37,178 --> 01:33:39,146
At first, we don't talk at all,

1098
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:40,713
then I'll tell you what I think
of you, and then you tell me

1099
01:33:41,682 --> 01:33:42,979
what you think of me.

1100
01:33:43,117 --> 01:33:45,449
Oh, no, your majesty.
I wouldn't dare.

1101
01:33:45,753 --> 01:33:48,085
That's right.

1102
01:33:50,691 --> 01:33:52,488
Well anyhow, we're in the cell.

1103
01:33:52,794 --> 01:33:56,059
We can't quarrel all night
and as time passes,

1104
01:33:56,197 --> 01:34:00,258
I begin to realize that after all
you're a woman.

1105
01:34:00,401 --> 01:34:03,131
And above all, I begin to realize
you're a man.

1106
01:34:03,271 --> 01:34:07,230
Right. And still more,
you're a gorgeous woman.

1107
01:34:07,375 --> 01:34:08,342
And as for me,

1108
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:11,172
You're wonderful, your majesty.

1109
01:34:11,312 --> 01:34:12,438
Thank you.

1110
01:34:16,884 --> 01:34:18,283
That's Marshovia.

1111
01:34:18,419 --> 01:34:20,910
The minute you go to party,
and people can't get out.

1112
01:34:21,055 --> 01:34:22,283
Oh, you're not so innocent.

1113
01:34:22,423 --> 01:34:23,412
What? You did the whole thing.

1114
01:34:23,724 --> 01:34:24,452
Did what?

1115
01:34:24,592 --> 01:34:26,685
You bribed the jailer to
lock you here with me.

1116
01:34:32,099 --> 01:34:35,193
I have to apologize,
you didn't bribe the jailer.

1117
01:34:35,336 --> 01:34:36,200
It's a conspiracy.

1118
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:38,202
Against both of us.

1119
01:34:38,339 --> 01:34:39,397
They want us to fall for
each other.

1120
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:40,871
We are threat.

1121
01:34:41,008 --> 01:34:43,772
Oh. But this is terrible.

1122
01:34:43,911 --> 01:34:44,935
What are we doing to do?

1123
01:34:45,079 --> 01:34:47,912
Oh, now, darling. You can't cry.

1124
01:34:48,049 --> 01:34:49,277
I beg your pardon. Let's calm down

1125
01:34:49,417 --> 01:34:52,318
Let's keep cool. I have it.

1126
01:34:52,453 --> 01:34:55,445
Let's fool them.
Let's fall for each other.

1127
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:56,716
That should be easy.

1128
01:34:56,858 --> 01:34:58,792
Really? Why should two people
who hate each other

1129
01:34:58,926 --> 01:34:59,449
Love each other.

1130
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:01,694
Right. Why then? Let's not do it.

1131
01:35:01,829 --> 01:35:03,296
We won't.

1132
01:35:03,431 --> 01:35:04,728
Let's drink to that.

1133
01:35:22,183 --> 01:35:25,675
May our hearts remain as cold as
the champagne.

1134
01:35:31,626 --> 01:35:33,355
Could be a little bit cooler.

1135
01:36:38,993 --> 01:36:40,221
Oh, please.

1136
01:36:41,862 --> 01:36:44,956
Any man who can dance through
life with a hundred women

1137
01:36:45,099 --> 01:36:51,868
And is willing to walk through
life with one should be married.

1138
01:36:56,310 --> 01:36:58,938
Captain Danilo, do you take...

1139
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:01,674
Yes, certainly.

1140
01:37:01,816 --> 01:37:03,306
Of course.

1141
01:37:05,019 --> 01:37:07,453
The End
