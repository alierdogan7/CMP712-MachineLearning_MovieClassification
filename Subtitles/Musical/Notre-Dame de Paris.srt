1
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,680
This is a story that takes place

2
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,200
In fair Paris in the year
of our Lord

3
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,480
1482

4
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,159
A tale of love and desire

5
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:27,359
We the artists of stature unknown

6
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,400
In sculpture and verse

7
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,760
Will attempt to transcribe

8
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:37,159
This story for you and posterity

9
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:45,519
The time of the cathedrals has come

10
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,000
As the world is entering

11
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,319
A new millenium

12
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:59,200
Man reached for the stars

13
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,680
To write his story

14
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,719
In glass and stone

15
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,400
Brick by brick, day after day

16
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,840
Century after century, with love

17
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:18,479
He saw the raising of towers

18
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:22,000
That he built with his hands

19
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,199
Poets and minstrels

20
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:28,080
Sang songs of love

21
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,840
That promised better times

22
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:34,199
For all of mankind

23
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:42,800
The time of the cathedrals has come

24
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:46,639
As the world enters

25
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:49,919
A new millenium

26
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:56,400
Man reached for the stars

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,240
To write his story

28
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,000
In glass and stone

29
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:14,520
The time of the cathedrals has come

30
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,280
As the world enters

31
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,520
A new millenium

32
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:28,159
Man reached for the stars

33
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:31,840
To write his story

34
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:38,520
In glass and stone

35
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:47,680
The time of the cathedrals is gone

36
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,759
Hordes of barbarians

37
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:54,879
Storm the city gates

38
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:01,439
Let them in, the pagans and vandals

39
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,280
The end of this world

40
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,680
Is predicted for the year 2000

41
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:23,480
Is predicted for the year 2000

42
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,399
We are
foreigners

43
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,040
Without passports

44
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,639
Men
and Women

45
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,240
Homeless

46
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,920
Oh! Notre Dame
we beseech you

47
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,839
Asylum! Asylum!

48
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:59,079
We are
foreigners

49
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,120
Without passports

50
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,000

and Women

51
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,600
The Homeless

52
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,480
Oh! Notre Dame
we beseech you

53
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,240
Asylum! Asylum!

54
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:14,480
We are a thousand or more

55
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:17,279
Pressing at the city doors

56
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,160
Soon we'll be

57
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:23,040
10,000 and then 100,000 more

58
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,040
We'll be millions

59
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,319
Beseeching you

60
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,399
Asylum!

61
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,360
Asylum!

62
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:37,199
We are
foreigners

63
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:39,399

Oh! Notre Dame
we beseech you

67
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,000
Asylum! Asylum!

68
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,079
We are vagabonds

69
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,959
At the city's doors

70
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,959
And the city is an island

71
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,519
In the island of the city

72
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,879
The world will change

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,759
And intermix

74
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,319
And we will play

75
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,439
On this island

76
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,000
We are
foreigners

77
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,759
Without passports

78
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:19,680

and Women

00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,000
The Homeless

80
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,639
We are
foreigners

81
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,399

The Homeless

84
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,079
Vagabonds

85
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,680
The Homeless

86
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:49,600
We are

Oh! Notre Dame
we beseech you

101
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,720
Asylum! Asylum!

102
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,079
We are
foreigners

103
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,360
Without passports

104
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,240
Men
and women

105
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,519
The Homeless

106
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:39,399
Oh! Notre Dame
we beseech you

107
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:49,959
Asylum! Asylum! Asylum! Asylum!

108
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,319
Sir Phoebus de Chateaupers
captain of the King's archers

109
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,399
I summon you to chase away

110
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,519
All these outlaws

111
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,920
By all means, we have to stop
this horde of strangers

112
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,600
Who disrupt the peace

113
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:22,199
Of the citizens of Paris

114
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,920
By your orders, my Lord Archidiacre

115
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,959
In the name of God I'll slay

116
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,600
And chase from your sight

117
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,600
All those louts with no standing

118
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,679
Where are you from, lovely stranger?

119
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,320
Daughter of the stars or the earth

120
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,000
Fair bird of paradise

121
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,000
Why are you here?

122
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:12,080
Gipsy

123
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,399
Nobody knows my land

124
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,679
Gipsy

125
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,120
I'm a child of the road

126
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:38,000
Gipsy, Gipsy

127
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,679
Where will I be tomorrow

128
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:53,399
Gipsy, Gipsy

129
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,039
It's written in the palm of my hand

130
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,919
My mother told me of Spain

131
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,600
As if it were her home

132
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,879
About the bandits in the hills

133
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,159
In the hills of Andalusia

134
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,960
In the hills of Andalusia

135
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:29,240
My father's gone, my mother too

136
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,840
Paris is my home

137
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,799
But when I dream of the sea

138
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,879
I'm transported far away

139
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,559
To the hills of Andalusia

140
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,000
Gipsy

141
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,279
Nobody knows my land

142
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,600
Gipsy

143
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:05,159
I'm a child of the road

144
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:14,759
Gipsy, Gipsy

145
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:20,799
Where will I be tomorrow

146
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,799
Gipsy, Gipsy

147
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:37,360
It's written in the palm of my hand

148
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:46,799
My childhood passed

149
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,320
Barefoot in the hills of Provence

150
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,720
For gipsies the road is long

151
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:56,679
The road is long

152
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,879
And I will keep on walking

153
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,639
Beyond the roads of France

154
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,840
I'll walk them
to the end of the earth

155
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:12,240
To the end of the earth

156
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,879
An Andalusian river

157
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,720
Runs in my blood

158
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,399
Runs through my veins

159
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,440
Are the skies of Andalusia

160
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,720
Worth

161
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:42,360
Going back to?

162
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,799
Gipsy

163
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,039
Nobody knows my land

164
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,799
Gipsy

165
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,159
I'm a child of the road

166
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:10,679
Gipsy, Gipsy

167
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,120
Where will I be tomorrow

168
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:26,000
Gipsy, Gipsy

169
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,240
It's written in the palm of my hand

170
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:47,279
It's written in the palm of my hand

171
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:07,159
You know, Esmeralda

172
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,159
You're no longer a child

173
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:15,480
And sometimes I look at you

174
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,360
With different eyes

175
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:24,639
You were only eight years old

176
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,840
When your mother left

177
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,919
Taken by death

178
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:41,080
To her home in Andalusia

179
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:46,799
She trusted you to me

180
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,480
And with jealousy

181
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:54,720
I watched over you

182
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,840
Until today

183
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,120
You know, Esmeralda

184
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:10,279
Men are wicked

185
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:14,799
Be careful when you run

186
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,480
In fields and streets

187
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,480
Do you understand me?

188
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:27,200
You're about to discover love

189
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:37,720
Nothing is the same as before

190
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,080
My fourteen summers
are for you

191
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,480
This diamond necklace
is for me

192
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,879
If your words and promises
are lies

193
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:02,279
I won't believe them

194
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:05,600
Your maiden's heart
is mine

195
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,039
Your eyes like a dove
are for me

196
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:10,240
The stars twinkle
in the skies

197
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,360
Less brightly than these eyes

198
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:15,399
He who my heart desires

199
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,480
Is a fair knight

200
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,879
Who doesn't know

201
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:21,519
The realms of my love

202
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,679
If I didn't know it

203
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,759
I can see it in your eyes

204
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,799
The one who wins your love

205
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,840
Will be a lucky man

206
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,679
Stop your search

207
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,639
Love is here

208
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,879
Here forever

209
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,080
So it is

210
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:39,159
The day will be merry
the day

211
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,840
When we marry

212
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,240
All the gold that still lies deep

213
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,080
Beneath the earth in veins asleep

214
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,480
I'll use to clothe your body

215
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,679
Your body that you'll give to me

216
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,279
All those lovers' lines

217
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,440
All those songs of desire

218
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,039
Better than any troubadour

219
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,680
You will sing to me

220
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:07,240
Stop your search

221
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,200
Love is here

222
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,680
Here forever

223
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:10,559
So it is

224
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,880
The day will be merry
the day

225
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,039
When we marry

226
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,279
Stop your search
love is here

227
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,640
Here forever
so it is

228
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:32,039
The day will be merry
the day

229
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,039
When we marry

230
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:36,880
The day will be merry
the day

231
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,880
When we marry

232
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,119
When we marry

233
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,359
Feast of fools!

234
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,279
Feast of fools!

235
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:32,960
Feast of fools!

236
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:36,720
Feast of fools!

237
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:46,720
I will preside

238
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,440
Over this feast of fools

239
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,559
Like we know how it's done
and we know how to have fun

240
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,119
Feast of fools!

241
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,839
Feast of fools!

242
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,799
Take the ugliest

243
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,880
Of those on the street

244
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,119
Let them parade
on the city's main square

245
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,960
And the one in that crowd

246
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,720
That conjures up

247
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,000
The ugliest face
will get the crown

248
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:24,440
The Pope of Fools!

249
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:28,240
The Pope of Fools!

250
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,440
He will wear the crown

251
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,319
He will wear the crown

252
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,160
The Pope of Fools

253
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:44,599
The

254
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:48,559
Feast

255
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,319
Of

256
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,839
Fools

257
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,119
The Feast of Fools

258
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,960
The Feast of Fools

259
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,880
The Feast of Fools

260
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,599
The Feast of Fools

261
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,319
The Feast of Fools

262
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,240
The Feast of Fools

263
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,400
But who is that there

264
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,319
Hiding in the back

265
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:28,440
Is he not the monster
that will wear the crown

266
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:32,000
The Pope of Fools!

267
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:35,799
The Pope of Fools!

268
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:39,960
He will wear the crown
he will wear the crown

269
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,440
The Pope of Fools!

270
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,799
He's the bell ringer

271
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,480
The hunchback

272
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,880
He's certainly the ugliest
he is Quasimodo

273
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,799
Now he starts giving

274
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,519
Poor Esmeralda the eye

275
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,839
Hunchbacked gimp, missing an eye
he's the one who'll wear the crown

276
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,079
The Pope of Fools!

277
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,119
He will wear the crown!
he will wear the crown!

278
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:12,680
Qua-si-mo-do!

279
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:16,680
He will wear the crown!
he will wear the crown!

280
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:20,599
The Pope of Fools!

281
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,319
He will wear the crown!
he will wear the crown!

282
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,359
Qua-si-mo-do!

283
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:32,279
The Pope of Fools!

284
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,519
Little girls
you won't mock anymore

285
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,400
When you see me on the streets
I'm Quasimodo the Beast

286
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:56,119
They've crowned me

287
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:59,200
The Pope of Fools

288
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:04,799
Today is the Epiphany

289
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:10,279
And for one day
I've the power of a king

290
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:12,839
Will you love me,

291
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,119
Esmeralda?

292
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,400
Will you love me?

293
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,319
But you don't care

294
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,880
Esmeralda

295
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:41,519
Oh! You couldn't care less

296
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,920
That they crowned me

297
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:55,039
The Pope of Fools

298
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,680
Little girls

299
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:00,359
Singing rondos

300
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,240
Mocking Quasimodo

301
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:06,079
The hunchback

302
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,160
How does it make you feel

303
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:12,039
That I'm this ugly?

304
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,119
I hate the parents
that gave me birth

305
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,599
And abandoned me without love

306
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,160
Will you love me,

307
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,000
Esmeralda?

308
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,400
Will you love me?

309
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:42,400
But you don't care

310
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,160
Esmeralda

311
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,200
Oh! You couldn't care less

312
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,000
That they crowned me

313
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,920
The Pope of Fools

314
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:11,799
The Pope of Fools

315
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:18,160
The Pope of Fools

316
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:24,279
The Pope of Fools

317
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,079
Beware!
this girl is not from here

318
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:50,319
She's a gipsy
a witch

319
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:52,640
She's a bitch
a streetcat

320
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,160
An animal on the prowl
barefoot and homeless

321
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:58,519
Mortal sin incarnate

322
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:01,839
She ought to be imprisoned

323
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,319
To stop this pillage

324
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:09,279
Of the hearts and souls
of the children of Notre Dame

325
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,599
Tonight we'll chase her
in the alleys

326
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,440
Tonight we'll take her away

327
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,000
We'll lock her in the tower

328
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:20,960
And teach her

329
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,559
The only true religion

330
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,440
Of Jesus and The Holy Mother

331
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,200
You can ask of me
anything

332
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:34,279
And I will do it for you

333
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:37,599
Anything you like
you know

334
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,160
Anything at all

335
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:47,440
I will do it for you
I will do it for you

336
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:52,000
You who took me in

337
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
Adopted and fed me

338
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,039
Me, the orphan

339
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,759
The child abandoned

340
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:02,599
By parents who were shamed

341
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,599
To have brought into this world

342
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:08,880
A monster

343
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,920
You who watched me grow

344
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,880
You who watched me suffer

345
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:17,160
You who offered protection

346
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,599
From this cruel world

347
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:22,200
You gave me my existence

348
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,839
By naming me ringer

349
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:29,319
Of bells

350
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,119
You taught me to speak

351
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,319
To read and to write

352
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,240
But I can't read

353
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:51,720
Your true feelings

354
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,279
I belong to you

355
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,880
to the depths of my soul

356
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,759
Like the deepest love of a dog

357
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,000
For his master

358
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:17,319
I belong to you
to the depths of my soul

359
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,039
Like the deepest love of a dog

360
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:25,839
For his master

361
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:44,759
The gates of Paris

362
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:49,799
Are closed at dusk

363
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,200
When nighttime's shrieks

364
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:59,319
And laughter in the dark
and nocturnal desires reign

365
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:06,519
Nights where every vice
are satisfied

366
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:09,920
In the heat of Paris

367
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:13,559
A showplace of lust

368
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,759
On the Pont-au-Change tonight

369
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:23,519
An angel I did meet

370
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:25,400
That smiled at me

371
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:29,480
Then disappeared

372
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,359
On the streets of Paris

373
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:39,880
I followed her and lost her

374
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,960
Pursued her into the night

375
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,519
lnto all the laughter
and carnal desire

376
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:56,319
Nights where every vice
is satisfied

377
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,640
In the heat of Paris

378
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,000
A showplace of lust

379
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,200
The gates of Paris

380
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:14,119
Are closed at dusk

381
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:19,680
When nightime's crimes

382
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,839
And laughter in the dark

383
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,119
And nocturnal desires reign

384
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:14,039
I am the captain

385
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:16,640
In charge of the peace

386
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,880
Of all citizens

387
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:22,960
Men and women alike

388
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:29,039
Allow me to escort you

389
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,960
Outside the city gates

390
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,839
Where the gipsies live

391
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:39,079
Men and women alike

392
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:42,519
Go your way

393
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,079
You've clearly made a mistake

394
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:54,799
Esmeralda,
good Sir, is not a soldier's girl

395
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:59,359
At dusk tomorrow

396
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,200
Tomorrow's end of day

397
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:08,359
I'll be there to see you

398
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:13,440
In "The Valley of Love Caberet"

399
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:19,599
In "The Valley of Love Caberet"

400
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:43,359
Here we are, brothers all

401
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,599
In misery and joy

402
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,440
Here there is no heaven or hell

403
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,279
No heaven or hell

404
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,839
Here we're just like worms

405
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:05,640
Worms in the rotten earth

406
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,839
Wine and blood share the same color

407
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,000
Here in the den of thieves
here in the den of thieves

408
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:14,839
Prostitutes dance with hoods

410

We're all the same breed

416
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,640
Of the homeless seed

417
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:45,200
You won't find here
a nation or creed

418
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,160
No nation or creed

419
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:52,400
Our rags, our flags

420
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:59,279
The color of my skin next to yours

421
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:03,039
Gipsies and villains
sing the same song

422

423
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:08,640

Here in the den of thieves
here in the den of thieves

425
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:15,039
Thieves and killers drink

427

Gringoire the Bard

431

You will hang

432
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,680
Convicted
of trespassing

433
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,160
Upon our sacred ground

434
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,279
Here in the den of thieves

435
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:46,039
Trespassing on our sacred ground

436
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:54,400
Trespassing on our sacred ground
here in the den of thieves

437
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,240
Unless a woman

438
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,359
Takes you for her husband

439
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,200
Be aware
I say to you

440
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:04,920
The poets of France

441
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,320
Are only fit to hang

442
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,400
The poets of France

443
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:19,440
The poets of France
are only fit to hang

444
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:26,119
And you my beauty

445
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,920
My lovely Esmeralda

446
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:30,480
Will you take as husband

447
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:33,360
This worthless minstrel?

448
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:36,400
This worthless minstrel?

449
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:42,440
If he's free, I'll take him

450
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:51,159
He's yours
as spouse but not as a lover

451
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,559
Wine and blood share the same color

452
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,639
Here in the den of thieves

453

Now may I know

472
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:45,119
Who I've the honor of marrying

473
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:51,320
I'm Grignoire the Bard
the prince of Paris's streets!

474
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,760
He's the prince of Paris's streets!

475
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,239
I'm not a ladies man
if you desire, I will make you

476
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,480
My nymph, my muse, my lady

477
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,400
You, who can read and write

478
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,920
You, the poet, do you know

479
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,760
What Phoebus means?

480
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,960
By Jupiter
who on this earth

481
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:18,519
Dares to go by this name?

482
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:21,320
He's the one
for whom my heart beats

483
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,960
If I recall
my latin

484
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,840
The word Phoebus means sun

485
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,599
Phoebus means sun

486
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:38,360
He's bright as the sun

487
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:42,639
Is he a prince, the son of a king?

488
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:46,599
I feel love

489
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:48,880
Deep inside

490
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:51,239
Stronger than myself

491
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,960
He's bright as the sun

492
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,320
He's a prince, the son of a king

493
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:07,840
Of a king......I think

494
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:13,599
He's bright as the sun

495
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,039
He's a rascal, a soldier

496
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:22,119
When he holds me tight

497
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:27,079
I want to run away, but I can't

498
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,639
He's bright as the sun

499
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,400
He's a rascal, a soldier

500
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:45,119
A soldier of the king

501
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,119
He's bright as the sun

502
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:53,519
My wonder, my man

503
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:57,840
He'll take me in his arms

504
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,559
And love me all his life

505
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,159
He's bright as the sun

506
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:11,679
My wonder, my man

507
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:17,000
He's bright as the sun

508
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:19,960
Bright

509
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:25,440

One for the night

524
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:11,559
One for love

575
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,079
Who is this girl
who dances

576
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:52,320
Her dance of shame
before the Notre Dame?

577
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,320
The girl is my wife

578
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,719
Given to me

579
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,920
By the King of the gipsies

580
00:42:58,039 --> 00:42:59,360
Did you touch her

581
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,199
Servant of Satan?

582
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,000
I wouldn't dare

583
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:05,159
And I forbid you

584
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:07,760
I would like to show you

585
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,239
An inscription here engraved

586
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:12,800
On a stone beyond

587
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:15,440
The Gallery of Kings

588
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,159
What does it mean-
this word "Anarkia"?

589
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,960
You're a man posessed

590
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:22,320
The Greek word "Anarkia"
signifies "Fate"

591
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,960
Is that not Quasimodo

592
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,719
That they're taking away?

593
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,920
He's got himself arrested, the fool

594
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:31,920
And only God knows why

595
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:44,000
Hunchback! Rapist! One-eyed & lame!

596
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:47,599
Damned ringer of the bells

597
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:51,039
Pray for him, the poor sinner

598
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:57,519
Have mercy on him, good Lord

599
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,639
Mercy
for poor Quasimodo

600
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,519
Who carries on his back

601
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,639
All the world's woes

602
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:20,199
And asks you only
for a drop of water

603
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:28,480
Have mercy, public
for this servant of the Lord

604
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,960
A drop of water only

605
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:34,440
For Quasimodo

606
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,440
I'm thirsty!

607
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:51,039
Give me a drop to drink!

608
00:44:54,320 --> 00:45:00,079
I'm thirsty!

609
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:04,000
I'm thirsty!

610
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:19,239
Give me something to drink!

611
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:30,440
Beauty

612
00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:32,239
Beauty

613
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,039
Beauty

614
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:54,000
It seems a word invented for her

615
00:45:54,400 --> 00:46:00,039
When she dances, revealing her body

616
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:05,760
Like a bird
spreads its wings to fly

617
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:11,239
I feel the devil
take me by the feet

618
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:17,000
My eyes gazed
under her gipsy dress

619
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:22,760
What shall I pray to Mary for?

620
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,800
Who

621
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:30,360
Will cast the first stone at her?

622
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:36,199
He who does not deserve to live

623
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:42,239
O Satan! Oh! Let me just once

624
00:46:42,519 --> 00:46:48,840
Pass my fingers through her hair

625
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,760
Beauty

626
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:04,880
Is she the devil incarnate

627
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:11,119
Leading me from the Eternal Lord

628
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,880
Who has bewitched me
with carnal desire

629
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:22,679
To turn me from heaven above?

630
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:28,840
She carries inside the original sin

631
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,480
Am I a criminal if I desire her?

632
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,400
She

633
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:41,320
Who all thought a whore,
a girl of the street

634
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:47,679
Suddenly seems to be
humanity's burden

635
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:53,800
Oh! I beseech you Our Lady
Oh! Allow me just once

636
00:47:54,320 --> 00:48:00,360
The entrance to Esmeralda's garden

637
00:48:10,039 --> 00:48:11,159
Beauty

638
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:16,599
Behind those eyes that cast a spell

639
00:48:17,639 --> 00:48:22,559
Could the girl still be a maiden?

640
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:28,559
When the moves she makes
promise me the earth

641
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:35,000
Underneath her rainbow skirt

642
00:48:35,239 --> 00:48:40,880
My betrothed,
leave me one infidelity

643
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:46,280
Before we're joined by God

644
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,320
What

645
00:48:48,519 --> 00:48:53,920
Man could resist gazing at her

646
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:59,360
At the risk of becoming transfixed?

647
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:01,880
Oh! My Lilly Flower

648
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:04,960
I'm not a man to trust

649
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:12,320
I'll pluck the flower
of Esmeralda's love

650
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:28,760
My eyes gazed
under her gipsy dress

651
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:34,480
What shall I pray to Mary for?

652
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,559
Who

653
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:42,000
Will cast the first stone at her?

654
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:47,840
He who does not deserve to live

655
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:53,840
O Satan! Oh! Let me just once

656
00:49:54,239 --> 00:50:00,719
Pass my fingers through the hair
Of Esmeralda,

657
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:11,519
Esmeralda

658
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:39,559
My friends, the gargoyles,
are watching over you

659
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:46,599
They'll protect you from any fool

660
00:50:47,639 --> 00:50:52,280
Whenever you need shelter

661
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:59,440
Come to me, I'll protect you

662
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:03,159
The Notre Dame of Paris

663
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,599
Is my house, my nest

664
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:10,079
It's my city, my life

665
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:13,719
My air, my roof, it's my bed

666
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:17,360
It's my song, my voice

667
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,239
My reason, my folly

668
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,559
My passion, my country

669
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,000
It's my prison, my homeland

670
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:32,679
Your friends the gargoyles
are my friends too

671
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:39,639
They make me laugh
on days when I'm bored

672
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:45,079
You're like them
and I like you for that

673
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:52,159
Even though I'm scared of you
most all the time

674
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:56,360
In my house

675
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,639
It's always comfy

676
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,760
Warm in the winter

677
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:07,000
In the summer it's cool

678
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:10,800
You are always welcome

679
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,280
Any time of the year

680
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,639
If you like, my house

681
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:22,079
Could be yours

682
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:41,440
Whenever you need shelter

683
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:47,920
Come to me, I'll protect you

684
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:51,239
In my house, in your house

685
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,280
It's always comfy,
it's always comfy

686
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,719
Warm in the winter
warm in the winter

687
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,159
In the summer it's cool
in the summer it's cool

688
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:05,960
You are always welcome
I'm always welcome

689
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:09,440
Any time of the year
any time of the year

690
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:12,920
My house, if you like
your house if i like

691
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:17,000
Could be yours

692
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:24,400
Could be mine

693
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:48,679
Ave Maria

694
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:54,840
Forgive me

695
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:05,719
If before you
I don't kneel

696
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:13,119
Ave Maria

697
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:22,400
I who won't go on my knees

698
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:30,920
Ave Maria

699
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:38,239
Protect me

700
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:46,079
From misery, evil and the fools

701
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:55,480
Who rule the world

702
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:08,280
Ave Maria

703
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:17,480
Foreigners are everywhere

704
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:26,079
Ave Maria

705
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:33,559
Listen to me

706
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:40,800
Take away the walls between us

707
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:50,519
Between brothers everywhere

708
00:55:56,519 --> 00:56:03,119
Ave Maria

709
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:12,559
Watch over me day and night

710
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:20,800
Ave Maria

711
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:28,360
Protect me

712
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:36,719
Guard my love and life

713
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:48,800
Ave Maria

714
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:11,920
I feel my life slipping

715
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:15,159
lnto some unknown world

716
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,079
I feel the crowd receding

717
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:23,400
When I walk the streets

718
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:25,960
I'm stripped bare

719
00:57:26,119 --> 00:57:29,360
Stripped bare

720
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:45,000
This ocean of passion
pulsing through my veins

721
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:49,440
Causes all my madness
my loss, my bad luck

722
00:57:49,639 --> 00:57:54,119
Softly I'll plunge into it
without a hand to save me

723
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:58,639
Slowly I will drown
without a bit of remorse

724
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,960
You will destroy me
you will destroy me

725
00:58:03,159 --> 00:58:07,480
And I'll curse you
to my death

726
00:58:07,639 --> 00:58:09,800
You will destroy me

727
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:12,159
You will destroy me

728
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:15,639
I could have foreseen
from the first day

729
00:58:15,719 --> 00:58:18,880
From the first night
you will destroy me

730
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:23,280
You will destroy me
you will destroy me

731
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,400
My sin, my obsession
tormenting mad desire

732
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:35,000
Making a fool of me
tearing me apart, haunting me

733
00:58:35,199 --> 00:58:39,519
Little pusher of illusion
I live with only one hope

734
00:58:39,679 --> 00:58:43,880
Of seeing your skirt fly past
while you sing and dance

735
00:58:44,199 --> 00:58:48,079
You will destroy me
you will destroy me

736
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:52,480
And I'll curse you
to my death

737
00:58:53,159 --> 00:58:57,239
You will destroy me
you will destroy me

738
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,760
I could have foreseen
from the first day

739
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:03,880
From the first night
you will destroy me

740
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:09,400
You will destroy me
you will destroy me

741
00:59:20,039 --> 00:59:24,679
I thought it was the autumn of life
and here I am, a young tree again

742
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:29,159
I thought I was a man of steel
far from the heat of flesh

743
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:33,719
I'm on fire, I'm burning
for the eyes of a stranger

744
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:38,280
That conceal much more mystery
than the light of the moon

745
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:42,440
You will destroy me
you will destroy me

746
00:59:42,599 --> 00:59:46,800
And I'll curse you
to my death

747
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:51,639
You will destroy me
you will destroy me

748
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:55,159
I could have foreseen
from the first day

749
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:58,440
From the first night

750
00:59:58,599 --> 01:00:03,880
You will destroy me
you will destroy me

751
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:10,039
You will destroy me

752
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,760
You will destroy me

753
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,000
You will destroy me

754
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,559
You will destroy me

755
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:40,159
Who is that man

756
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:46,480
Is it my shadow behind me
or a ghost in the night

757
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,840
Why would my shadow

758
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:56,960
Wear a coat
wear a hat

759
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:01,400
Who are you?

760
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,320
Unmask yourself!

761
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:07,000
Come closer!

762
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:10,119
ldentify yourself!

763
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:15,480
I'm your conscience
heed my words

764
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:21,400
If you want to escape
the gallows

765
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,679
Soldier of the King

766
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:26,639
Go away
from the place

767
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:31,000
You are about to enter

768
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,360
A soldier of the King I am

769
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,000
But tell me

770
01:01:37,639 --> 01:01:40,000
You who've followed me

771
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,960
Here

772
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:49,400
Are you not God's servant?

773
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:57,000
Of course!

774
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:02,639
Up the street of St. Denis

775
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:08,199
There is a blessed place

776
01:02:08,519 --> 01:02:13,280
You can see the candles burning
as evening falls

777
01:02:16,039 --> 01:02:18,840
There in the middle of the plain

778
01:02:21,639 --> 01:02:24,239
If you go there once

779
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:29,000
You'll want it everyday
at The Valley of Love Cabaret

780
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,880
At The Valley of Love
the girls who serve

781
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:34,679
Will cater to your desires
for pennies

782
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:37,480
No need for gold
nor for jewels

783
01:02:37,719 --> 01:02:40,239
No need for speeches
or words of love

784
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:43,000
Only a few pennies
to make love

785
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:45,159
With the girls who serve
in The Valley of Love

786
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:50,559
Andalusians, Jews and Moors
arrive from every port

787
01:02:50,719 --> 01:02:56,320
Travelers and merchants
rest there for awhile

788
01:02:56,599 --> 01:03:01,239
Catalonians and Flemish alike
blow all their money in one night

789
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:06,880
The girls who serve

790
01:03:09,639 --> 01:03:12,519
Listen to this minstrel's song

791
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:20,159
Crying out his lovesickness
in The Valley of Love Cabaret

792
01:03:20,239 --> 01:03:22,840
Beat those drums
in the neighborhood

793
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:25,679
Hurry along
to The Valley of Love

794
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:28,400
No danger
of falling in Love

795
01:03:28,599 --> 01:03:31,159
With what's under the clothes
in The Valley of Love

796
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,800
You wil find
under the velvet

797
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,280
Flowers for one night
pleasure for one day

798
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:41,400
When I feel lovesick

799
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,639
I'm off to the Valley of Love

800
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,000
You stay there 'til break of day
at The Valley of Love Cabaret

801
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:57,639
Pardon me girls

802
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,360
I'm waiting for lovely Esmeralda

803
01:04:06,039 --> 01:04:11,000
She saw her destiny
in the palm of my hand

804
01:04:11,199 --> 01:04:13,760
North city door
on the outskirts

805
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:16,559
At the crossroads
of Popincourt

806
01:04:16,679 --> 01:04:19,320
All the thieves
all the rogues

807
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:22,199
Meet each other
at the Valley of Love

808
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:24,800
Noblemen
dishonour themselves

809
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:26,960
You'll see them drink
'til they're dead drunk

810
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,679
At The Valley of Love
the girls who serve

811
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:32,559
Will cater to your desires
for pennies

812
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:35,239
No need for gold
nor for jewels

813
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,119
No need for speeches
or words of love

814
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:40,800
Only a few pennies
to make love

815
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,039
With the girls who serve
in The Valley of Love

816
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:48,679
In the Valley of Love Cabaret

817
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:54,199
In the Valley of Love Cabaret

818
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,559
Sensuous

819
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,760
For me voluptuous delight

820
01:05:38,519 --> 01:05:41,480
From this pure body

821
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:44,559
For me all these delights

822
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,880
Nobody else but me

823
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:53,880
Will touch you

824
01:05:56,719 --> 01:06:03,639
Black angel of mine

825
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:12,519
I'll love you
in the depths of night

826
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:20,840
With just one look
you set me on fire

827
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:28,800
Our skins of two colors

828
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:37,840
Like
a burning torch

829
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:47,159
I'll love you
love you even if I die

830
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:55,679
Take me
take me if that's my fate

831
01:06:57,239 --> 01:07:04,079
Let us see
let us see if that's your fate

832
01:07:06,039 --> 01:07:08,599
Phoebus

833
01:07:08,679 --> 01:07:11,920
Esmeralda

834
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:17,559
Fate

835
01:07:18,039 --> 01:07:20,239
Mistress of our destinies

836
01:07:20,519 --> 01:07:22,719
Fate

837
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,280
When you cross our path

838
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:30,639
Fate
prince or pauper

839
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,159
Fate

840
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,679
Queen or prostitute

841
01:07:36,119 --> 01:07:38,639
Fate

842
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:45,400
You hold our lives in your hand

843
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:55,000
Fate

844
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:04,119
Fate

845
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:20,720
Fate
