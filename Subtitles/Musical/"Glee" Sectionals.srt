1
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:03,865
<i>Here's what you missed last week.</i>

2
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:05,905
<i>Will found out Terri's fake pregnant.</i>

3
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:08,202
<i>Yikes. Will left, and he's
sleeping at school...</i>

4
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:11,869
<i>and he's disqualified from sectionals
because he slept on a mattress.</i>

5
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,913
<i>And Quinn's pregnant,
but Puck's the father, not Finn.</i>

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,141
<i>Which is awkward since
Quinn's been living at Finn's house...</i>

7
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:17,979
<i>since her parents kicked her out.</i>

8
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,747
<i>And Sue gave the competition
Will's set list for sectionals.</i>

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,812
<i>And Ken and Emma's wedding is that same
day, so Will can't go to the wedding...</i>

10
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,415
<i>and Emma can't go to sectionals,
and Ken just seems kind of angry.</i>

11
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,961
<i>- And that's what you missed on...
- ¶¶ Glee ¶¶</i>

12
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,967
I bet we get stuck with Mr. Sinacori
as our sectionals adviser.

13
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,525
The creepy math teacher?

14
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:38,662
He's always singing
when he walks down the halls.

15
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:41,036
<i>Hey, guys. Did any of you
think it was weird...</i>

16
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:43,769
the way that Puck rushed to Quinn's aid
during rehearsal yesterday?

17
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:47,476
<i>Is it the baby? Is it comin' ?</i>

18
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,242
I think we're supposed to get hot towels.

19
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:51,249
Would you both just shut up!
There's sweat on the floor.

20
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:53,251
I slipped, okay? I'm fine.

21
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:57,946
No.

22
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,322
I mean, he likes her.
They're friends. We all know that.

23
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,191
<i>Yeah, but it seemed like more than that.</i>

24
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:06,130
I've never told you guys this before,
but I'm a little psychic.

25
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:08,133
I can't read minds or anything yet...

26
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,169
but I do have a sixth sense.

27
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,636
Something is definitely going on there.

28
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:14,696
Uh, we-we gotta go.

29
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:17,004
- We have to practice.
- Oh, and we will.

30
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,012
As soon as Mr. Schuester
names a faculty adviser to replace him.

31
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,379
<i>It's nothing to be scared of.
It's not like Carrie or anything.</i>

32
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,709
Hey, she's onto it.

33
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:28,253
I know. It's really freaking me out.

34
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:29,583
Hold up.

35
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,317
Artie's buzzing. I'm going party line.

36
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,416
Dudes, this is serious.
If she finds out, she's gonna tell Finn.

37
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,427
She's a total trout mouth.

38
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,224
Kurt wants in.

39
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:40,266
I say we lock Rachel up until after sectionals.
I volunteer my basement.

40
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,733
- We can't. We need her to sing.
- Damn her talent.

41
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:45,270
- We just heard. Who told?
- We assumed it was you.

42
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:47,465
- Why would I do that?
- To get back at Puck.

43
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,474
- Aren't you guys dating?
- Sex is not dating.

44
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,703
If it were, Santana and I would be dating.

45
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,914
Look, I don't wanna rock the boat.

46
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:58,212
Since Quinn got pregnant,
I'm top dog around here.

47
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,275
Hold up.
Rachel's walking by.

48
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,617
Hey, hot mama.

49
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,418
She's gone.

50
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,982
Look, I know I screwed up
telling all you guys about Quinn and Puck.

51
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,187
And I feel really terrible about it...

52
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,321
but we cannot let Rachel figure this out.

53
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,194
If she tells Finn, he's going to flip.

54
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,427
And then we really have
no chance at sectionals.

55
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,167
Are you sure about this?

56
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:28,539
<i>But the wedding's on Saturday...
your wedding.</i>

57
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,276
I know. We just pushed it
back a few hours.

58
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,079
Now it doesn't have
to happen in broad daylight.

59
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,713
<i>I want to do this, Will.
I want to take the kids to sectionals.</i>

60
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:40,191
Okay, but... but what about Ken?
He's gonna be furious.

61
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,956
I appealed to him as an educator.

62
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:44,724
You will always choose Schuester over me.

63
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:47,857
He won't even be there, Ken.
I am doing this for the kids.

64
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,799
I really thought that you of all people
would understand this.

65
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:53,134
This time, I don't think that I do.

66
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,368
He took it great. Just great.

67
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,639
I can't...

68
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:02,647
I can't thank you enough.

69
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,185
<i>Hey. I know it's not my place...</i>

70
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:14,420
but have you had your doctor run the full
genetic test panel on your unborn child?

71
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:17,759
I only ask because my Cousin Leon
and his wife got pregnant...

72
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,094
and then they found out
that he was a carrier for Tay-Sachs.

73
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:23,101
- What's that?
- It's a genetic disorder.

74
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,103
Pretty terrible from what I understand.

75
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:28,106
If one of the parents is a carrier,
there's a 50% chance that the child has it.

76
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,108
Or something like that.

77
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,201
No. Leon's-Leon's baby was fine.

78
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,940
It-It was still pretty scary though.

79
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,515
My doctor never mentioned that.

80
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,485
You know... I'm such an idiot.

81
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,919
They would only run the test
if one of the parents was Jewish.

82
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,287
- Yeah. Only Jews carry the gene.
- Oh.

83
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,519
Okay. Well, see you in rehearsal.

84
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,927
You have to take me to go get
those Jewish baby tests.

85
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,464
Why? Is that even a real thing?

86
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:53,931
If something is wrong with the baby...

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,399
Terri Schuester isn't gonna take it.

88
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,800
And I can't ask Finn.
He'll know something's up.

89
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,930
Does this have to happen tonight?
Because I have my fight club.

90
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:05,842
<i>Hey, guys, let's, uh... let's gather round.</i>

91
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:12,448
Well, I have found my replacement.

92
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,349
So give it up for Miss Pillsbury.

93
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,245
She's the one they made me talk to...

94
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:19,052
when they found out I was
keeping that bird in my locker.

95
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,355
So do you even know anything about music?

96
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,089
What's important is that she cares
about you guys...

97
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:27,155
every bit as much as I do.

98
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,167
Now...

99
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,199
I don't know what the future
holds for me...

100
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,266
and for us.

101
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:40,676
But I know, Saturday,
you're gonna make me proud.

102
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,682
You guys are gonna be great.

103
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:49,745
So... good-bye for now.

104
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,158
Wait. What about our set list?

105
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,627
I-I can't help you with that.

106
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,065
You've gotta figure that out
for yourselves.

107
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,338
All right, guys.

108
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,234
Oh, God.

109
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,937
Well, we have to do "Proud Mary"
in wheelchairs. That's in.

110
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:15,412
- And "Don't Stop Believin"' for sure.
- What about the ballad?

111
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:19,850
I would be thrilled
to contribute a ballad from my repertoire.

112
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,411
<i>Okay, you know what,
Miss Bossy Pants? Enough.</i>

113
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,390
I've worked just as hard as you,
and I'm just as good as you.

114
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,394
You know, you always end up
stealing the spotlight.

115
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,363
Mercedes, do you honestly think
you're as strong of a balladeer as I am?

116
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,229
Ballads are kind of my thing.

117
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,201
<i>Okay, um, Rachel...</i>

118
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,261
<i>why don't you let Mercedes give it a try?</i>

119
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,304
Thanks, Mrs. P.

120
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,899
Rachel.

121
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,536
Do I even need to tell you what song?

122
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,546
Horns, strings, keep up.

123
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,850

157

<i>- Yo!
- Mercedes!</i>

158
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,284
Thoughts?

159
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,757
It's clear the room adores you.

160
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,627
And although it wouldn't
be my first choice, but...

161
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,433
I can't wait to see you
sing that song at sectionals.

162
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:28,803
You're amazing, Mercedes, and...
you deserve it.

163
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,968
- I'm gonna hug you now.
- Okay.

164
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,977
- Okay.
- Come on.

165
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,284
That was pretty cool in there.

166
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,979
I know that must have been hard for you.

167
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:44,454
It was the right thing to do.
I wanted to bring the team together.

168
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,254
Yeah. You know, I gotta be honest.

169
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:49,123
I'm kind of pumped about sectionals.

170
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,562
I mean, this has been
a hard couple of months...

171
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,623
with Quinn and the baby
and everything, and...

172
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,635
I don't know. I really think that...

173
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:01,867
winning could make everything
good for a while.

174
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,102
You know? Is that stupid?

175
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,838
It's not stupid at all.

176
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:11,341
- Is something up with you?
- I want you to be happy, Finn.

177
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,977
- Oh.
- And when you care about someone...

178
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,782
you can't sit around
and watch them suffer...

179
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:19,120
when you know you can
do something about it.

180
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:21,625
What are you talking about?

181
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,685
I have to tell you something.

182
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,373
Hey, come on! Come on!

183
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,674
Get off! Knock it off!
Get off him! Get off!

184
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,839
<i>- Hey!
- Tell the truth!</i>

185
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,315
<i>- Punk just walked in and sucker-punched me!
- Don't play dumb!</i>

186
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,477
- You're too freakin' dumb to play dumb.
- Hey! Come on!

187
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,316
Who told you this, Finn?

188
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,481
- Obviously, it was Rachel.
- What? I didn't do anything.

189
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,650
Yeah, it was Rachel,
but I wanna hear it from you.

190
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,819
- I wanna hear it from both of you.
- Finn, just calm down.

191
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,693
No! They're both lying to me!

192
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,823
Is it true?

193
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,834
Just tell me. Is it true?

194
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,371
Yes.

195
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,381
Puck is the father.

196
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:29,091
So all... all that stuff in the hot tub...

197
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:32,528
- you just made that up?
- You were stupid enough to buy it.

198
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,429
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

199
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,333
I am so sorry.

200
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,496
Screw this.

201
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:42,200
I'm done with you!

202
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:45,710
I'm done with... I'm done with all of you!

203
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,419
I'm so sorry.

204
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,356
I fully understand
if you want to beat me up.

205
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:13,370
If you can, just try and avoid my nose.
Right.

206
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,897
I'm not mad at you.

207
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:21,208
All you did is what
I wasn't brave enough to do...

208
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,214
tell the truth.

209
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:30,521
I... I was selfish when I told him.

210
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,615
I wanted to break you two up
so he would want to be with me.

211
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,258
And now neither of us have him.

212
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:43,133
I have hurt so many people.

213
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,800
Can you go now?

214
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,867
I just really want to be alone.

215
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,326
Hey.

216
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:14,360
So, I know you're upset now.

217
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,367
But I want to be with you...

218
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:19,666
and I'm gonna do everything I can
to be a good dad to our baby.

219
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,265
Thanks.

220
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:26,243
But I honestly can't handle...

221
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,872
any more stress in my life right now.

222
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,909
I'm gonna do this on my own.

223
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,289
I know you don't understand it...

224
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,349
but please respect it.

225
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,807
- So, the competition starts at 11:00.
- Right.

226
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,979
- I'll have my cell phone on.
- I know. You already told me... three times.

227
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,318
And you wrote it down.

228
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,018
Reporting for duty, Mr. Schuester.

229
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,755
I have to tell you
I get terrible public event anxiety.

230
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,093
You know what, Jacob, it's okay.

231
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,998
We just need a 12th member.
All right? So, um, just sway in the back.

232
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,399
- You don't even have to sing.
- Yeah. Don't even sing.

233
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,596
- Okay.
- Great.

234
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,768
Oh, my God.

235
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:33,376
So, um, still no word from Finn?

236
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,948
No.

237
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,007
I can't thank you enough.

238
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,075
Okay.

239
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,422
Okay.

240
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:24,587
So, smooth sailing so far.
We're all signed in.

241
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:27,496
And, um, according to the program...

242
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,831
you have drawn
performance lot number three.

243
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,064
We're going last? Isn't that bad?

244
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:36,437
Hardly. This is good news.

245
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,373
My extensive auditioning
for community theater has taught me...

246
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,639
that we either want to go first or last.

247
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,147
<i>If we're first, then everyone
has to measure up to us.</i>

248
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,649
And if we're last, then we're the freshest
in the judges' minds.

249
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,618
And did you ever get any of those parts?

250
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,322
I'm with Rachel on this.

251
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,020
<i>The glass is definitely half full with
some very good things right now.</i>

252
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:59,087
Yeah. Miss Pillsbury's right.
I mean, we're here now, right?

253
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:01,860
<i>No reason not to go in
with some positive mojo.</i>

254
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,458
Right. Right.

255
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,935
- Right.
- Right.

256
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:09,532
¶¶ And you... And you... And you ¶¶

257
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:13,510
<i>¶¶ You're gonna love me ¶¶</i>

258
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,106
<i>¶¶ Yeah, oh ¶¶</i>

259
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,446
<i>- It's a really popular song.
- ¶¶ You're gonna love ¶¶</i>

260
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:23,545
¶¶ Me ¶¶¶¶

261
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:29,616
- ¶¶ Rollin' ¶¶
- ¶¶ Yeah ¶¶

262
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,686
- ¶¶ Rollin' ¶¶
- ¶¶ Yeah ¶¶

263
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,527
<i>¶¶ Rollin' on the river ¶¶¶¶</i>

264
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,378
<i>We've got a problem.</i>

265
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,282
They're doing all of our numbers.
The kids are completely freaking out.

266
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,685
Artie keeps ramming himself into the wall, and
I'm pretty sure Jacob Ben Israel just wet himself.

267
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:59,019
I knew it. Sue leaked the set list.

268
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:04,095
Will? Will, these kids
need a leader right now.

269
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:09,598
Just hold tight. I know what to do.

270
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,863
Okay.

271
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,908
Sue!

272
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,908
What kind of teacher are you?

273
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,380
Hey, buddy. I just came by
to feed my Venus fly trap.

274
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:26,009
You leaked the set list,
and you are not going to get away with it.

275
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,019
That is a libelous accusation...

276
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,783
and I insist you retract it immediately.

277
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:34,519
- You have no proof.
- No proof?
You are the only person who had the list.

278
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:37,585
But other than that, you have no proof.

279
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,928
It's time to face facts, William.

280
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,731
At 1:00 p.m. this afternoon, your little club
will have had its shot at the big time...

281
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,737
and they will have failed.

282
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:49,569
Glee Club will be canceled.

283
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:53,577
And all that money Figgins has been
funneling into your budget...

284
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:57,103
will finally and rightfully
be restored to mine.

285
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,116
You have crossed a line.

286
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,381
I am not going to sit idly by anymore.

287
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:05,218
I am going to expose you...

288
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,758
for the fraud that you have become.

289
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,226
Bring it on, William.

290
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:13,059
I am reasonably confident
that you will be adding revenge...

291
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:17,228
to the long list of things
you're no good at.

292
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,736
- Right next to being married...
- Don't.

293
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,898
running a high school glee club...

294
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:25,171
and finding a hairstyle
that doesn't make you look like a lesbian.

295
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,679
Love you like a sistah.

296
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,682
Get your hands off me.

297
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,275
You're not gonna push a woman, are you?

298
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,344
I didn't think so.

299
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,265
Hey, Finn.

300
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:55,135
- Just called your mom. She told me you'd be here.
- Yeah, you know...

301
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:58,005
football season ended,
so I'm just cleaning out my things.

302
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,671
Sounds like something
that could have waited till Monday.

303
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:05,182
- You heard anything?
- Yeah.

304
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,218
It's pretty bad.

305
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,657
- I can't be there.
- And I can?

306
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:17,320
<i>I can't even be in the same room as her
without crying like a girl.</i>

307
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:20,365
I can't look at him without
wanting to punch his face off.

308
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,764
Look, I don't have
any more pep talks, Finn.

309
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:25,565
You know I know how you feel.

310
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:28,697
Look, all I know is that...
between you and me...

311
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,674
I don't think
that they can win without you.

312
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:34,701
But that's not fair. Why does it always
have to come down to me?

313
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,544
Why do I always have to be the bigger man?

314
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,176
Because sometimes being special...

315
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,915
sucks.

316
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,226
I just want everything to be like it...

317
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,228
like it never happened, you know?

318
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,526
Well, Finn...

319
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,935
you can't always get what you want.

320
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,908
Listen...

321
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,001
I'll be in the choir room.

322
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,505
Oh, Mr. Schue, you forgot your keys.

323
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,572
No, I didn't.

324
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,883
Nope, your money's no good here.
I'm buying.

325
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,949
Celebratory giant pretzels.

326
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,961
I don't feel much like celebrating.

327
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,589
Why not? One of us
is gonna take this thing.

328
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,302
Hi. Nice set list.

329
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,100
Of course, I haven't heard
your deaf kids perform yet...

330
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,607
- but I hear they're doing "Don't Stop Believing."
- Um, who are you?

331
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,610
I'm so sorry. Let me introduce myself.
I'm Emma Pillsbury.

332
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,306
I'm the faculty adviser
for the McKinley High School Glee Club.

333
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,111
Oh. What happened to the white guy
with the Jheri curl?

334
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,745
You should be ashamed.
Aren't you ashamed? You're educators.

335
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,913
Actually, no.
You know what? You're more than that.

336
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:53,617
You take care of disadvantaged kids,
and you're teaching them...

337
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,922
that the only way they can compete
in this world is by cheating.

338
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,928
I'm sorry, but what kind
of message is that?

339
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:59,930
I don't know what you're talking about.

340
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:03,263
"Don't Stop Believing" is the most
downloaded song in the history of iTunes.

341
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,327
I've only got one good ear,
and even I know that. Scarlet fever.

342
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:10,000
Right. And "Proud Mary"... in wheelchairs?

343
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:13,602
Do you have any idea how much winnin'
is gonna mean to my girls?

344
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,647
It's gonna be a life changer...

345
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,739
make them feel like they're
worth something again.

346
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:21,775
I'm-I'm sorry. Do you think that they're
not gonna know that something's up?

347
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,787
The fact that you just
magically came up...

348
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:26,187
with two brand-new numbers
days before competition?

349
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,920
They were great up there.
That's all I know.

350
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,589
I think what we
have here is a case of deaf racism.

351
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,962
Shame on you.

352
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,967
No, you know what the real shame is?

353
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:39,697
It's that maybe if you believed in them
just a little bit more...

354
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:42,296
they would have been amazing up there...

355
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,535
without cheating.

356
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:51,113
<i>¶¶ Don't stop believing ¶¶</i>

357
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:55,483
<i>¶¶ Hold on to that feeling ¶¶</i>

358
00:20:55,554 --> 00:21:01,015
<i>¶¶ Streetlight people ¶¶</i>

359
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,254
Meeting in the greenroom in five minutes.

360
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:05,956
<i>¶¶ Don't stop believing ¶¶¶¶</i>

361
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,829
You leaked the set list.
You don't wanna be here.

362
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,835
You're just Sue Sylvester's little moles.

363
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:15,532
I know for a fact that's true.
Sue asked us to spy for her.

364
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,041
<i>Look, we may still be Cheerios,
but neither of us...</i>

365
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,135
ever gave Sue the set list.

366
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:23,545
Well, I... I did, but I didn't know what
she was gonna do with it.

367
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,053
Okay, look. Believe what you want...

368
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:32,682
but no one's forcing me to be here...

369
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,919
and if you ever tell anyone this,
I'll deny it...

370
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:37,257
but I like being in Glee Club.

371
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,764
It's the best part of my day, okay?

372
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,823
I wasn't gonna go and mess it up.

373
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,243
I believe you.

374
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,474
Okay, look, guys.
There's no point in us arguing anymore.

375
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:59,278
- We-We have to go on in an hour.
- And we have no songs.

376
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,182
Perhaps I could improvise
some of my def poetry jams.

377
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,949
<i>No. Look, we're gonna
do this the right way.</i>

378
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:06,616
Let's start with a ballad. Mercedes, do you
have anything else in your repertoire?

379
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:10,526
- Yeah, but it's not as good
as anything you're gonna sing.
- No. We agreed...

380
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:14,463
We agreed that I would sing,
and I'm telling you, that ain't happening.

381
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:18,799
Look, Rachel, the truth is,
you're the best singer that we've got.

382
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,304
<i>As much as it hurts me
to admit it... and it does...</i>

383
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:25,036
she's right... Rachel's our star.

384
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,806
If anyone's gonna go belt it on the fly,
it should be her.

385
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:33,540
Well, I do have something that I've been
working on since I was four.

386
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:36,781
<i>Then I guess we have our ballad, and we
can close with "Somebody to Love."</i>

387
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:40,382
- It's a real crowd-pleaser.
- Yeah. That and a can of soup
will guarantee us third place.

388
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:43,451
<i>We still need another song
we can all sing together.</i>

389
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:51,327
I have one.

390
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:54,599
I found the sheet music online.

391
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:57,938
<i>I used the Cheerio's copier
to make copies...</i>

392
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,807
then I trashed the thing.

393
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,976
Mike, Matt, Brittany, Santana...

394
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,452
<i>you're our best dancers. Figure something out,
and we'll all follow your lead.</i>

395
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:13,116
- It's gonna be choppy.
- Good. We're best when we're loose.

396
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:19,763
Look, all we have going for us is that we believe
in ourselves, and what we're singing about.

397
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:21,822
<i>If we can show the judges that...</i>

398
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,869
we might have a shot at this thing.

399
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,508
It's good to have you back, Finn.

400
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,307
- Cool if I take my spot back?
- Quite.

401
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,372
I was just here because I was hoping
to get into Rachel's pants.

402
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:42,843
Cool, dude?

403
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,494
No.

404
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:54,825
Finn, I...

405
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,396
- You okay?
- Don't worry about me.

406
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,405
Okay? This is all up to you now.

407
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:04,704
You wanted the solo.
You wanted the chance to be the star.

408
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,870
This is your chance. Don't screw it up.

409
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,518
<i>Are-Are they nervous? Has it started?</i>

410
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,430
<i>- Showtime.
- And now, our final team...</i>

411
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,935
McKinley High's New Directions.

Juicy, and you see ¶¶

Okay, I'm just
gonna come out and say it.

492
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,292
This is a singing competition.

493
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,596
I don't know how those deaf kids got in.

494
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:10,534
They weren't singing. They were, like,
honking. And everyone was crying.

495
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:12,542
And I was, like, "Get off the stage.

496
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,578
You're terrible,
and you're making me super uncomfortable."

497
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,274
Now, hold on just a second, Candy.

498
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,947
Those "Haverhurst" kids...

499
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,148
twice had me reaching for my handkerchief.

500
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:29,284
And those Jane Addams girls
had it goin' on in all the right places.

501
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,294
Can I just say something?

502
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:35,128
I have no idea
what the hell I'm doin' here.

503
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:42,129
I'm serious.
I don't understand what a glee club is...

504
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:45,404
and I have never even
heard the term "show choir"...

505
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:48,036
until about three hours ago,
when my boss told me...

506
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,046
he had tickets to NASCAR...

507
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,548
and I had to fill in at this fool event.

508
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,748
Those Jane Addams girls... I'll be damned...

509
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:02,281
if I didn't apportion hundreds of
thousands of tax payers' dollars...

510
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,988
to that school so they can parade
their behinds around...

511
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:08,123
- like a bunch of hoochie hos.
- The McKinley group was good...

512
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:11,828
but didn't seem all that rehearsed,
but I like their energy.

513
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:15,202
Well, I have to admit,
I have a soft spot for the Rolling Stones.

514
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:19,403
I was at Altamont Speedway in '69.

515
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,342
I actually saw that guy get stabbed.

516
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:24,245
<i>Can't get that image out of my noggin...</i>

517
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,647
to this day.

518
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:30,586
I seriously don't know
what either one of you are talking about.

519
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:33,180
I have never been so bored.

520
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:35,852
I mean, if I had to pick a group
that I hated the least...

521
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:40,289
It doesn't sound good, guys.

522
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:44,633
Hey. Um...

523
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:48,433
I just wanted to say how great you all
were, and I thought you were amazing.

524
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:50,440
We have nothing to say to you.

525
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:52,442
Because we cheated. I know.

526
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,638
I feel terrible about it,
but I'm gonna tell the judges right now...

527
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:57,874
that we don't deserve to win.

528
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:04,146
And your e-mail address is...

529
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:06,884
You guys were so much fun to watch.

530
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,051
You should be very proud.

531
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:12,255
Get me the hell outta here.

532
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:16,164
Um, excuse me.
Um, I have something I need to tell you.

533
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:18,634
I'm sorry. We've made our decision.

534
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:37,510
- Hi.
- I thought you worked on Saturday afternoon.

535
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:40,557
Yeah. I came home early. I'm tired.

536
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:44,686
I haven't been sleeping very well.

537
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:48,394
What's with the monkey suit?

538
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:52,869
- Ken and Emma's wedding. It's at 4:00.
- Oh, yeah.

539
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,773
Here.

540
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:59,071
- No, I'm fine.
- Oh.

541
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:04,344
I want you to know
I've been seeing a therapist.

542
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:08,351
<i>Oh, it's just at the local
community center, but still.</i>

543
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,755
Good.

544
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,519
I hope it works out for you.

545
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,617
I'm taking responsibility, Will.

546
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:18,628
I mean, I'm weak and I'm selfish...

547
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:21,597
and I let my anxiety rule my life.

548
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,634
But you know I wasn't always that way.

549
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,430
It's just that...

550
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:31,566
I wanted so many things
that I-I know we're never gonna have.

551
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,941
But that was okay
as long as I still had you.

552
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:43,820
Say something.

553
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,790
I'm looking at you...

554
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,453
and I'm trying...

555
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,793
I mean, I really want to feel that...

556
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,390
thing I always felt
when I looked at you before.

557
00:33:57,902 --> 00:34:00,496
That feeling of family.

558
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,505
Of love.

559
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:07,736
But it's gone.

560
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:10,007
Forever?

561
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:11,844
I don't know.

562
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,635
<i>Hey.</i>

563
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,642
Nice ice sculpture.

564
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,671
W-Where's Ken?

565
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:50,150
Um...
home, I'd imagine.

566
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:52,155
Probably trying to regain...

567
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:54,157
some of the pride that I stole from him.

568
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:59,855
- He dumped me.
- What?

569
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,525
He said moving the wedding
for sectionals was the last straw.

570
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:07,736
But I thought he understood that-that you
were doing this for the kids.

571
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,465
He understood that...

572
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,807
I wasn't doing it for the kids.

573
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:21,012
I was doing it for you.

574
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:26,552
Emma...

575
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,558
I'm so sorry.

576
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,424
No. Gosh, no. It's not your fault.

577
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:34,693
I... I really messed up.

578
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:38,792
He was absolutely right.
I was settling for him.

579
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,804
Really, one blink from you, Will...

580
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:42,840
and I would have been out the door.

581
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:50,714
So, um...

582
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:54,109
I e-mailed my resignation to Figgins.

583
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:56,278
Oh, E...

584
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:58,288
My last day is Monday.

585
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:02,784
I just can't...

586
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,794
I just can't be at that school.

587
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:07,797
I can't see Ken without feeling ashamed...

588
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:11,028
and I can't see you
without feeling heartbroken.

589
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:21,672
I just left my wife.

590
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:29,814
No, I'm sorry. I, um...

591
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,323
I'm going.

592
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:39,587
- But I just...
- Just left your wife.

593
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:42,132
<i>Exactly.</i>

594
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,134
<i>You just did.</i>

595
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,308
You make a beautiful bride.

596
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:56,412
Thank you.

597
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:21,605
Sue, the directors...
both from the Jane Addams Academy...

598
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,970
and Haverbrook School
for the Deaf have informed me...

599
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:26,976
that you gave them
the New Directions set list.

600
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:28,875
You have no proof.

601
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:32,848
- The set lists were on Cheerios letterhead.
- I didn't do it.

602
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,147
They say "From the desk of Sue Sylvester."

603
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:38,484
- Circumstantial evidence.
- They're written in your handwriting.

604
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:42,458
- Forgeries.
- Sue, there is an orgy of evidence
stacked against you.

605
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:45,893
Well, you've clearly made up your mind
not to be impartial in this case...

606
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:49,592
so let's see if you can't wrap up
this little lecture, slap me on the wrist...

607
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:52,534
and let me get back to whipping my squad
of champions into shape.

608
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,800
We have to be in Albuquerque
in a couple of weeks for nationals.

609
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,841
Sue!

610
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:00,172
Sit down.

611
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:08,183
Sue, as of today,
you are no longer coach of the Cheerios.

612
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:10,982
<i>- I beg your pardon?
- As of today...</i>

613
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:13,387
you are no longer coach of the Cheerios.

614
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,687
- I beg your pardon.
- All this time...

615
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,228
<i>- I thought Mr....
- I beg your pardon!</i>

616
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,732
All this time I thought
Mr. Schuester was overreacting.

617
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,529
And, frankly, I was too willing to look
past your monkeyshines...

618
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:27,366
because you kept winning,
but now you have gone too far.

619
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:31,067
You have embarrassed yourself and
besmirched the name of William McKinley.

620
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,508
<i>- A failed president!
- Oh, please.</i>

621
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:35,511
<i>The greatest one who ever lived.</i>

622
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:38,707
You are suspended from the school,
as of today.

623
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:43,018
Schue, you have anything to add?

624
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,850
- I think you said it all.
- My word is official.

625
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,193
Let it be written.

626
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:53,894
Okay, if this is the way
you wanna play it.

627
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,933
Okay.

628
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:04,866
Schue. In light of Sue's interference...

629
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:07,069
I am reinstating you
as coach of the Glee Club.

630
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:10,341
I contacted the Ohio
Show Choir Governing Board...

631
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:12,405
<i>and set the record straight.</i>

632
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,576
Thank you, sir.

633
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:17,280
My pleasure.

634
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,415
All right. Good job.

635
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:30,267
Schuester.

636
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,431
Well played, sir.

637
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:41,634
I underestimated you.

638
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,674
All right, here's what happens now.

639
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,014
I'm gonna head on down
to my condo in Boca...

640
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:51,111
brown up a bit,
get myself back into fighting shape...

641
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:54,919
then I'm gonna return to this school even
more hell-bent on your destruction.

642
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:57,187
Get ready for the ride
of your life, Will Schuester.

643
00:39:57,261 --> 00:40:00,958
You are about to board
the Sue Sylvester Express.

644
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:03,829
Destination: horror.

645
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,028
I look forward to it, Sue.

646
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:08,663
You know, you just woke a sleeping giant.

647
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,300
Prepare to be crushed.

648
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:25,188
Well, we have a few things
we'd like to show you, Mr. Schue.

649
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:31,319
First...

650
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:33,955
Ta-da!

651
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:44,634
Ohh. I am so proud of you guys.

652
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:46,300
<i>You won fair and square.</i>

653
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:48,971
The result was unanimous,
and the judges didn't even know...

654
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:51,879
about all the shenanigans
that were going on behind the scenes.

655
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,884
So congratulations.

656
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,886
You earned this.

657
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,047
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Give it up. Come on.

658
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,284
All right.

659
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,349
But...

660
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:08,425
now we have regionals to worry about,
and you can bet...

661
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:11,593
that Vocal Adrenaline is hard at work,
so we should be too.

662
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:13,933
So... Let's get started.

663
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:17,167
Uh, wait, Mr. Schue.
There's one more thing.

664
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:19,709
Since you weren't able
to be there to see us perform...

665
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:23,076
we put together
a special number just for you.

666
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,581
<i>Take a seat.</i>

667
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:32,422
