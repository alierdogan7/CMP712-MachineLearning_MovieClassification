We have with us today a man who
is so much a part of the culture...

2
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:21,689
That he scarcely needs
an introduction.

3
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:23,691
Pootie tang.
Good to have you here with us.

00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,601
Music, films,

00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,717
Well, i can't say the nay-No,

00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:30,658
[Man narrating]
it was the year 2001.

21
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:36,530
It was the best of times.
It was the worst of times.

22
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:40,168
The big city was thriving,
but the inner city was dying.

23
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:42,336
Who was killing it?

24
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,274
This man. Dick lecter.

00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:48,776
The head
of corporate america.

26
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:50,411
But the people had hope...

27
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,614
Because they knew that there was
one man who could fight the power.

28
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:56,650
One man who could stop
the madness.

29
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:59,720
One man who could beat
dick lecter like the l.A.P.D.

30
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:06,594
And that man-- That man
was pootie tang.

133
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:17,731
[Narrator] pootie tang was born in a
small town outside of gary, indiana.

134
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:21,034
And that town
was called chicago.

135
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:22,703
As he grew,

136
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:26,874
Everyone noticed something different
about the way pootie would talk.

137
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:30,878
It baffled everyone--
Doctors, scientists.

138
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:32,780
Let me break it down
to you like this.

139
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:37,017
Pootie tang is, was
and will always be...

140
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,053
Too cool for words.

141
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:45,759
[Kid] hi, pootie!
Pootie tang was the most popular kid in town.

142
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:48,028
We didn't always know
what he was saying,

143
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,130
But we always knew
what he meant.

144
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:53,934
Like i knew i was his best friend.
That's me. Trust me.

145
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:57,037
Yeah, he had
a special effect on people,

146
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,039
Especially on the ladies.

147
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,775
Not girls.
Grown-Ass women.

148
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:08,882
Hiya, pootie tang. I'm a tine cappy,
my damie. Wa-Da-Tah.

149
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,819
All right, pootie tang.
But for some of the ladies,

150
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:15,088
Pootie was just
too hot to handle.

151
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:17,057
Damn you, pootie tang!

152
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,792
I can't take
no more of this!

153
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:21,795
Who do you think you are,
treatin' me this way?

154
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:25,899
Oh, i've had it with you!
You hear me talkin' to you with your nappy head!

155
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:28,769
This is it!
I'm finished with you!

156
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:31,672
Get out of my life,
pootie tang!

157
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:34,374
You think i'm jokin'?
Take your shit!

158
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:41,682
Take your shit and get out,
pootie tang! I'm sick of you!

159
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:45,686
Pootie--
Pootie, don't go.

160
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:51,925
* Just because you bought her
a brand-New car *

161
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:55,696
* and you got to live
and eat in a mansion *

162
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:57,965
* like a movie star *

163
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,967
Pootie tang
was an only child.

164
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,704
His father, daddy tang,
worked hard to raise pootie right.

165
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:06,707
He had this belt.
He was so fast with that belt...

166
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:12,312
That before pootie could do wrong,
daddy tang would set him right.

167
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:16,249
Don't you grab them peas
without askin' your mama, boy.

168
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,986
May i dane on the cherries,
mama di?

169
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,255
Yes, you may, pootie tang.

170
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,857
Now, that's better.

171
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:29,029
You got to have respect
to get respect, pootie tang.

172
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:32,866
So, do you have any girlfriends at school, pootie?

173
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,904
Aw, mama di. There's a sine
tippi in a classi-Ti.

174
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:39,006
She's a cole toni.

175
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,009
Don't you talk dirty
to your mama, boy.

176
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:44,745
Always got your head
in them girls.

177
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:46,880
You need to have
your head in the books.

178
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:48,682
Leave the ladies alone.

179
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:50,918
[Narrator]
and that's the way it was.

180
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:53,020
Daddy tang and his belt
was always there,

181
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:56,757
Teaching pootie the difference
between good and bad.

182
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:03,163
Now, when i say he was always there,
i mean he was always there.

183
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:08,335
Hey, pootie, let's
steal some apples.

184
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:17,778
When pootie was only six,
his mother died,

185
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:20,113
Leaving him
and his father alone.

186
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:23,216
- Pootie was very sad.
- I know, son.

187
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,419
But his father was a comfort to him.
[Slurping]

188
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:29,757
Don't slurp your soup
in here, boy.

189
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,427
Two weeks later,
another terrible tragedy.

190
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:39,132
His father was fatally injured at the steel mill.

191
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:43,036
What the fu--

192
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,505
Gorilla!
Gorilla!

193
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,274
It was incredible.

194
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:51,812
Only the third time a man had been
mauled by a gorilla at that steel mill.

195
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:54,281
Gorilla! Oh!

196
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:59,920
On his deathbed,
daddy tang had pootie make a solemn promise.

197
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:01,488
Pootie,

198
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:05,092
I know
i brought you up tough,

199
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,160
But that's
'cause i love you.

200
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:11,098
It's tough
out there, pootie.

201
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:15,836
You got drugs,
crime, gorillas.

202
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:18,471
Yeah.

203
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:21,909
I ain't gonna
be here much longer,

204
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:24,778
So i'm gonna
give you this.

205
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:28,315
Pootie,
that's my belt.

206
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:32,119
As long as you got it
right on your side,

207
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:38,191
You could whoop anyone's ass with just that belt.

208
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:42,262
I know
you love the ladies,

209
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:46,533
And lord knows
the ladies love you.

210
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:50,938
Don't let the ladies come between you and the belt.

211
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:53,306
[Weak coughing]

212
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,376
[Narrator] those were daddy tang's last words:

213
00:12:56,409 --> 00:13:01,982
"Don't let the ladies come between you and the belt."

214
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:05,853
But there was something
else about the ladies...

215
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:11,024
That daddy tang forgot
to tell little pootie.

216
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,561
- Pootie tang turned out just fine.
- [Crowd] pootie tang!

217
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:17,064
Daddy tang
would have been proud.

218
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:21,134
Yeah, pootie had it all--
Hit records, movies,

219
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,904
Magazine covers,
fancy cars,

220
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:26,907
Famous friends, beautiful
custom-Made clothes...

221
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,844
And ladies, ladies, ladies.

222
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:35,315
Through it all, i was right there by his side.
That's me. Trucky.

223
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:36,917
And that's my man,
pootie tang.

224
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,319
Pootie tang.
Pootie tang!

225
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:42,222
Big-Time celebrity,
ass-Kickin' crime fighter...

226
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:43,891
And role model
to the children.

227
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:48,428
[Announcer] pootie tang has a
message for the children of america,

228
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:54,101
So you better
wapatah to the bammies 'cause:

229
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:59,506
Pootie says cigarettes and fast-Food
burgers are bad like netatai.

230
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:05,245
And don't drink malt liquor 'cause
you don't need to 'cause you're okay.

231
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,082
Sa da tay. Also, eat
all your vegetables...

232
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:14,154
And don't bang the dillies.

233
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:28,468
[Trucky] that's frank,
dick lecter's right-Hand man.

234
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:31,271
So what do we care?

235
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:34,041
We care because
he's making these.

236
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:40,013
People have been making p.S.A.'S for years.
Hasn't made a difference.

237
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:43,650
Eddie, uh, hit me
with those figures.

238
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:46,954
Uh, since the inception of
pootie tang's p.S.A. Campaign,

239
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:50,457
Sales of lecter burgers
are down 30 percent,

240
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,260
Lecter cigarettes
down 20 percent...

241
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,262
And lecter whiskey,

242
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:56,696
Almost out of business.

243
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:00,500
For the first time,
somebody's getting to these kids, and it's killing us.

244
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,435
It's killing us.

245
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:05,973
It's killing us.

246
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:09,442
[Rings]

247
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:16,283
Hello, mr. Lecter.

248
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:20,653

[Trucky] that's j.B. And lacey.
We make up pootie's crew.

251
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:31,731
Pootie tang will draw you a picture

252
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,467

You go,

255
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:42,009
Then pootie tang knocks on your door,
promptly kicks your ass,

256
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:43,977
And you still won't know
what happened to you.

257
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:47,314
You got that right.
He is a kick-Ass artiste. Yes.

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,703
Um, i-I need

296
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,706
[Clears throat] all right, uh, look, pootie.

297
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,676
I'm a representative of lecter corp.
Do you know what that is?

298
00:17:56,709 --> 00:18:00,147
Great.
Well, uh, dick lecter,

00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,683
The c.E.O., Mind you,
of lecter corp., He likes you.

300
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:07,787
He likes you, pootie,
and he wants to make you a very rich, rich man.

301
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:12,159
I have a contract here
for pootie to endorse.

302
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:14,627
Tasty heavy
pork chunk cereal.

303
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:17,697
It's delicious.
It's a wonderful product. Kids love it.

304
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:23,270
And kids love you.
We just wanna put that together.

305
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:25,438
Nah, di.

306
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:27,607
That's a canapan
to the semachai.

307
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,143
I didn't even tell you
how much it pays, pootie.

308
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:33,213
Twenty million dollars to sign with us for just one year.

309
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:36,483
Oh, what do you say,
pootie?

310
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:40,353
I got to say the nay-No,
my brother. Wa-Da-Tah.

311
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:45,225
Wa-Da-Tah?
How do you say the nay-No to 20 million? Why?

312
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:48,728
Maybe pootie don't wanna sign
because he knows you're full of it.

313
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:53,466
Yeah. First of all,
he knows that cereal's full of sugar.

314
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,536
And number two,
that's not all that you guys sell.

315
00:18:56,569 --> 00:19:01,908
You sell cigarettes, whiskey,
bad time burgers, switchblades.

316
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:06,746
And it also says right here that you will
no longer have pootie doing p.S.A.'S...

317
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:09,716
Telling the kids to eat
healthy and to be smart.

318
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,718
Well, sure, exclusivity
goes without saying.

319
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:15,888
I'm sure your ugly intentions go without saying.

320
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:18,558
Take a walk,
money man.

321
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:26,733
See, my damie,
pootie tang don't wa-Da-Tah to the shama cow...

322
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:30,737
'Cause that's a cama
cama leepa-Chaiii, dig?

323
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:35,708
Hey, tang, to you, they're children.
To me, they're dollar signs.

324
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,212
Doh!

325
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:41,248

326
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:42,515

Aw, man!

00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:52,525
You funny, man.
You are a funny man.

330
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,993
You's a wild boy.

331
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,729
[Trucky] pootie smacked the taste out of frank's mouth.

332
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:59,566
Oh, man, that
was funny to us. Ha-Ha!

333
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:04,737
But there was one man
who was not laughing at all.

334
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:08,941
Pootie tang goes out there
and makes everybody love him.

335
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:12,845
He tells them
not to buy my products.

336
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,815
He steals from me.

337
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:17,750
And what do i do?

338
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:23,323
I say take my money. Here.
Take it. Fine. Huh?

339
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:24,857
And he says no.

340
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,560
[Trucky] i guess you're wondering,
who is this bitch here?

341

That's ireenie,

And the most dangerous
woman on the planet.

343

Okay, pootie,

502
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:58,250

510
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:23,475
How does a woman
get to you anyway?

511
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:26,512
It's like a state secret.

512
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:30,182
How to bed pootie tang.

513
00:32:30,216 --> 00:32:32,218

Someday you gonna meet

And then you gonna be

Done banged to death

00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:05,251
And on that day, pootie,

522

00:33:21,267 --> 00:33:25,437

Do you want me

00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:50,596
I might enjoy that. You know,

534
00:33:50,796 --> 00:33:55,033
Ooh, ooh! Oh!
[Screams]

535
00:33:57,236 --> 00:34:00,839
Oh! Okay, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

536
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,542
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute!

537
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:07,246
Look here. Call me a sissy,

00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,248
You are tearing me apart.
You're killing me.

539
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:11,250
You want me to stop?
Well, yes, i do.

540
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:15,087
Okay, then,
you tell me something.

541
00:34:15,121 --> 00:34:18,757
What do you wanna know?
What's pootie's secret?

542
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:22,461
Oh. Oh.
I can't tell you that.

543
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:25,464
[Trucky] now,
i would never do anything to hurt pootie tang.

544
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:29,768
But like i said,
ireenie knew how to break a brother down.

545
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:33,239
I can't tell you that.
You can't? All right.

546
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:36,108
[Screams]

547
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:38,777
Whoo! Whoo!

548
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,679
Okay, wait.
I'll tell you.

549
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:43,882
I'll tell you.
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

550
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,518
It's the belt.
It's the belt.

551
00:34:46,552 --> 00:34:48,720
It's-It's-It's magical.

552
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:53,659
He can kick anybody's ass with that damn belt.

553
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:01,500
Freeze, sucker!

554
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:06,672
Yeah. Give me your money,
you fancy pants bastard,

555
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:09,508
Or i'll stick this
in you deep.

556
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:12,211
Wa-Da-Tah,
my damie.

557
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:17,649
Hey, i'm not your damie.
Now, give me your cash. I know you got it.

558
00:35:19,318 --> 00:35:24,756
Hey, i told you
to back off!

559
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:37,236
Pootie. Hey, pootie.
Trucky.

560
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:39,938
Pootie, the craziest thing just happened to me.

561
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:44,176
I'm in the club, man.
I'm-- Pootie, look out.

562
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:49,848
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

563
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:55,287
Bang! Bang! Bang!
[Groans]

564
00:36:00,526 --> 00:36:03,762
Pootie?
Everything under control?

565
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:06,398
[Sobbing]

566
00:36:06,432 --> 00:36:08,934
Kayed a brother, di.

567
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:11,270
Kayed a brother, di!

568
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:13,805
I'm a shamey day!

569
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,908
I'm a shamey day!

570
00:36:18,644 --> 00:36:21,780
Oh, it hurts pootie
to kill a man,

571
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:24,416
But he knows
he's got to do it.

572
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:27,219
But it hurts him
so bad...

573
00:36:27,253 --> 00:36:29,255
To right those wrongs.

574
00:36:29,288 --> 00:36:31,290
My man pootie tang!

575
00:36:31,323 --> 00:36:34,860
[Siren wailing]

576
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:38,897
[Sobbing continues]

577
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:42,534
Come back
on the bettie tai!

578
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:45,571
Come back on
the bettie tai!

579
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:48,974
Come back
on the bettie tai!

580
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:52,444
Huh? Huh?

581
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:55,947
Pootie tang?

582
00:36:56,515 --> 00:36:59,251
Hey, all right,
my damie.

583
00:36:59,285 --> 00:37:03,722
Now, why didn't trucky tell pootie
that he told ireenie all his business?

584
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:04,923
Just runnin' his mouth.

585
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:08,560
I guess when you see a man
being brought back from the dead,

586
00:37:08,594 --> 00:37:10,496
You forget shit.

587
00:37:10,529 --> 00:37:13,499
Or maybe you just
a dumb-Ass.

588
00:37:19,004 --> 00:37:23,642
[Trucky] stop the movie.
Remember when daddy tang told little pootie--

589
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:27,579
Don't let the ladies come between you and the belt.

590
00:37:27,613 --> 00:37:32,050
Well, what daddy tang forgot to tell
pootie was about his only weakness:

591
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,752
Ho's.

592
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:36,021
Even pootie tang's belt
was no match for ireenie.

593
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:40,025
You can't beat a ho' with a belt.
They like that shit.

594
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:44,730
* That girl is poison

595
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:51,837
* that girl is poison

596
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,772
* poison *

597
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:58,810
I'm sorry.
Did my cart hit your cart?

598
00:37:58,844 --> 00:38:04,550
Oh. I'm so sorry
about that.

599
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:13,925
Did i hurt you?

600
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:16,728
Oh, what a drag.

601
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:19,365
Again, i am...

602
00:38:19,398 --> 00:38:22,834
Very sorry!

603
00:38:30,676 --> 00:38:34,680
* If i were you
i'd take precaution *

604
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:38,950
* before i step to meet
a fly girl *

605
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:45,457
** [continues]

606
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:49,395
[Ireenie] pootie,
will you do something for me?

607
00:38:49,428 --> 00:38:53,465
Will you do something
for me?

608
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:58,870
Sign your pretty name.

609
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:05,844
Sign it.

610
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:09,581
Sign it. Sign it.

611
00:39:09,615 --> 00:39:12,618
Sign it.

612
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:22,761
He signed it.

613
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:30,469
He signed it.

614
00:39:30,502 --> 00:39:33,472
He signed it.
Oh, god.

615
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:37,476
Signed it?
Nice job, ireenie.

616
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:39,778
You're a damn genius, baby.
Uh-Huh.

617
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:42,781
"I, pootie tang, do surrender

618
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:46,051
All the rights to

619
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:47,986
No.
Oh, yes, yes.

No, not
the tippi tais, no.

625
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:04,903
No, no. You are part of the corporation,
just like us.

626
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:08,006
Thought you could stay
out of it, huh?

627
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:12,744
Welcome aboard,
pootie tang.

628
00:40:12,778 --> 00:40:15,080
Are you looking
for something, my friend?

629
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:19,751
Are you?
I've got it all now.

630
00:40:19,785 --> 00:40:23,555
Shocking news today as beloved
pootie tang has agreed to endorse...

631
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:26,825
Several controversial
products for lecter corp.,

632
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,794
The infamous
giant corporation.

633
00:40:28,827 --> 00:40:31,697
Yo, fellas,
somethin' on the tv about pootie tang.

634
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,799
Even my kids, man, looked up to him.
You know what i mean?

635
00:40:33,832 --> 00:40:37,936
They don't even look at dad
like they look at him.

636
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:40,772
But now since he crossed,
man, my little--

637
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:42,808
My little man came up to me the other day and was like,

638
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:44,776
"Man, how could he do
that bullshit, man?

639
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,045
[Beep] that [beep]" i'm lookin' at him like, "whoa."

640
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:51,517
[Speaking spanish]

641
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:55,687
[Continues in spanish]

642
00:40:56,722 --> 00:41:01,026
Pootie tang has made my children cry.
I'll not support him anymore.

643
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:04,029
Lecter corp.
Effectively owns the name pootie tang,

644
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:07,833
His image and all copyrights
that go along with it.

645
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:09,234
Mr. Lecter!
Mr. Lecter!

646
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:12,971
Mr. Tang has agreed to do several
commercials endorsing our sneakers,

647
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:16,642
Food products and cigarettes, whiskey,
mace, switchblades, rat poison.

648
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:18,510
[Woman] mr. Lecter,
can we have a statement--

649
00:41:18,544 --> 00:41:21,046
* why you sell out,
pootie **

650
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:25,183
Pootie?
Oh, no!

651
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,152
You know, biggie shorty,
i got to say,

652
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:30,722
I always had a high opinion of pootie tang.

653
00:41:30,756 --> 00:41:33,592
But the way things are going now,
not only has he sold out,

654
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:35,594
He's scraping
the bottom of the barrel.

655
00:41:35,627 --> 00:41:39,130
Pootie tang was drugged
by that crazy-Ass ireenie.

656
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:41,733
- Haven't you been watchin' the movie?
- And that's what disturbs me.

657
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:45,136
He's out there telling kids not to go to school,

658
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,938
To eat fast food,
to do drugs.

659
00:41:46,972 --> 00:41:50,776
This is not the pootie tang i thought
i knew and i used to admire.

660
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:54,613
- Pootie tang-- He would never tell kids like that.
- You're in denial.

661
00:41:54,646 --> 00:41:56,848
He's out there doing dirt to his own reputation.
Look.

662
00:41:56,882 --> 00:42:00,619
- You don't know pootie tang.
- I don't know pootie tang?

663
00:42:00,652 --> 00:42:02,654
Believe me,
i know pootie tang,

664
00:42:02,688 --> 00:42:04,756
And this is not the pootie tang i thought i knew.

665
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:08,093
You know what? I thought a man of
your stature would have better sense...

666
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:11,296
Than to fall
for no mess like that.

667
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:14,900
[Sighs] look,
this thing has all fallen apart.

668
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:18,737
The man used to be admired
by people of all walks of life.

669
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,606
And you know what?

670
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:24,810
If the world is gonna fall for this
mess about my pootie tang,

671
00:42:24,843 --> 00:42:26,978
Then maybe the world
don't deserve pootie tang.

672
00:42:27,012 --> 00:42:30,816
What do you think pootie tang
needs at this point in his life?

673
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:33,218
He just needs some
of my good lovin'...

674
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:36,021
And he will be all right.

675
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:38,189
- You watch.
- I hope you're right.

676
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:40,726
- I know i'm right.
- Yeah, we'll see.

677
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:42,794
Yeah, we'll see.
That's right.

678
00:42:42,828 --> 00:42:45,697
Watch.

679
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:50,969
* You used to be a hero

680
00:42:51,002 --> 00:42:56,074
* now you're just
a big, fat zero **

681
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:58,977
[Trucky]
pootie tang was messed up.

682
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:01,813
Punk bitch.
Sellout.

683
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:05,684
[Trucky] look at him.
Damn, pootie! Get a job, you bum.

684
00:43:05,717 --> 00:43:10,155
Get it together, man.
Pootie looked like who did it and ran.

685
00:43:10,188 --> 00:43:12,991
Pootie turned to the only woman who could help him.

686
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:16,962
Biggie shorty.
* Biggie shorty

687
00:43:19,164 --> 00:43:22,300
* biggie, baby *

688
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:26,672
Pootie!

689
00:43:26,705 --> 00:43:30,709
Aw, pootie.

690
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:33,879
Poor pootie tang.
Tippi tai.

691
00:43:34,412 --> 00:43:38,116
That's all right.
Mama's got you.

692
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:41,319
That's all right.

693
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,123
Biggie shorty's
gonna take care of you.

694
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:47,192
Don't you worry.

695
00:43:47,225 --> 00:43:50,729
Gonna have sex
with you too, you know.

696
00:43:50,762 --> 00:43:53,364
Finally.

697
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,340
Are you sure you
gotta go, pootie?

698
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:04,309
Yeah.

699
00:44:04,342 --> 00:44:06,845
[Sucks teeth]
that's a damn shame.

700
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:10,015
You were the best piece
of man i ever had.

701
00:44:10,048 --> 00:44:13,018
You know,
you could just stay here and live between my bosoms...

702
00:44:13,051 --> 00:44:16,855
For the rest
of your life.

703
00:44:16,888 --> 00:44:20,759
Pootie gotta flittie tai,
biggie shorty.

704
00:44:20,792 --> 00:44:23,394
Man's gotta do, i suppose.

705
00:44:23,428 --> 00:44:27,365
I guess as long as you gone they can't
make you do no more commercials.

706
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:30,936
But where you gonna go?

707
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:35,841
I tell you what.
I got a little farmhouse outside of greenville.

708
00:44:35,874 --> 00:44:38,944
It was my mama's. It ain't much,
but nobody's livin' there.

709
00:44:38,977 --> 00:44:43,782
You go out there,
find yourself, blah, blah, blah.

710
00:44:43,815 --> 00:44:46,351
But then you come
back to me, okay?

711
00:44:46,384 --> 00:44:48,253
That's a fine tine, baby.

712
00:44:48,286 --> 00:44:55,060
Now, give me some of that bony ass
one more time before you hit the road.

713
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:05,771
Man, i hates prison.
Prison sucks.

714
00:45:05,804 --> 00:45:08,907
I reckon
it's supposed to.

715
00:45:09,808 --> 00:45:12,477
You got somethin'
for me?

716
00:45:17,115 --> 00:45:19,918
Oh! Oh!
Uh-Huh. Uh-Huh.

717
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:21,820
Mm-Hmm.

718
00:45:21,853 --> 00:45:25,991
Oh, this some fine dirt.
This is some good dirt.

719
00:45:26,024 --> 00:45:28,426
Oh!
You know i'm gonna hook you up.

720
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:30,428
Man, i hate
these bastards.

721
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:32,163
They make me shower
every day.

722
00:45:32,197 --> 00:45:38,336
They never let me get dirty.
I need to be dirty. I'm dirty dee, damn it!

723
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:40,305
Dirty dee.
Huh?

724
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:45,243
You gonna be dirty
again soon. I promise.

725
00:45:45,276 --> 00:45:47,378
It's that pootie tang.

726
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:49,981
It's that pootie tang.
He got to be stopped.

727
00:45:50,015 --> 00:45:54,519
I'm the one that's got to stop him.
Pootie goddamn tang!

728
00:45:54,552 --> 00:45:59,357
* You gonna, you gotta

Pootie! Pootie!

731
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:07,432
[Trucky] pootie was headed to the farm.
I wanted to go with him.

732
00:46:07,465 --> 00:46:10,869
I wanna go with you, brother.
'Cause everything that happened was all my fault.

733
00:46:10,902 --> 00:46:14,005
Pootie, everything that happened, man,
it's all my fault.

734
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:17,809
I told that bitch all about him.
I told this bitch all these things about you, man.

735
00:46:17,843 --> 00:46:20,578
She just used it against him.
And she just used it against you.

736
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:24,015
I was sorry. I'm sorry, man.
I'm so sorry.

737
00:46:24,049 --> 00:46:25,616
It was killing me.
It was killing me.

738
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:30,255
Only did it for the ass.
Only did it for her ass, you understand.

739
00:46:30,856 --> 00:46:33,024
That deri-Teri was
all the dinie, huh?

740
00:46:33,058 --> 00:46:35,961
I felt like he saved my life.
Pootie, man, i just feel like...

741
00:46:35,994 --> 00:46:37,829
You saved my life.

742
00:46:37,863 --> 00:46:40,298
And i messed his all up.
Now i messed yours all up.

743
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:45,036
I wanted him to forgive me.
Can you ever forgive me, man?

744
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:48,139
Aw, trucky.

745
00:46:48,173 --> 00:46:51,076
You my main damie, man.

746
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:55,180
Ain't no bad tammie
between us.

747
00:46:55,213 --> 00:46:58,016
I wondered if he meant it.
You mean it?

748
00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:01,920
I'm a baino denny.
I wanted to go to the farm with him.

749
00:47:01,953 --> 00:47:04,522
Can i go to the farm
with you, brother?

750
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:06,324
Wa-Da-Tah!

00:47:06,357 --> 00:47:09,094
All right!

752
00:47:09,127 --> 00:47:12,397
Whoo! You know,
i'm lookin' forward to this farm life.

753
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:15,300
Enough of the city
for me. Whoo!

754
00:47:15,934 --> 00:47:19,871
Yeah, this is just
what we need, pootie.

755
00:47:19,905 --> 00:47:24,075
Live off the fat
of the land, work hard.

756
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:27,879
Farming, farming, farming.
I can't wait, man.

757
00:47:27,913 --> 00:47:29,614
I cannot wait.

758
00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:33,084
We're gonna milk that cow.
Ooh-Whoo!

759
00:47:33,118 --> 00:47:35,086
Get all that milk.

760

Skim milk. All that, man.
Chocolate milk.

762
00:47:41,259 --> 00:47:45,230
I don't need
no television, cappuccino,

763
00:47:45,263 --> 00:47:47,365
Partying all night long.

764
00:47:47,398 --> 00:47:50,969
I'm want some blisters on my hands,
some sweat on my back.

765
00:47:51,002 --> 00:47:53,138
That's what i want, pootie.

766
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:55,606
[Grunts]

767
00:47:59,177 --> 00:48:00,678
Shit!

768
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:04,682
Oh, man. My pants.
Oh, man! My damn pants.

769
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:09,154
All right.
Farming, farming, farming.

770
00:48:16,327 --> 00:48:18,997
[Grunting]

771
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:22,333
This is not the thing, man.
This ain't cool, man.

772
00:48:22,367 --> 00:48:25,403
Dirty shoes,
dirty pants,

773
00:48:25,436 --> 00:48:27,973
Dirty shirt,
musty, stinky.

774
00:48:28,006 --> 00:48:29,640
It's hotter than
a camel's hump out here, man.

775
00:48:29,674 --> 00:48:32,110
And mosquitos all over my shirt.
I can't do it, man.

776
00:48:32,143 --> 00:48:34,679
[Dog barking] whose dog is
this dog following me around?

777
00:48:34,712 --> 00:48:37,082
Whose dog is that?
You don't know who dog that is.

778
00:48:37,115 --> 00:48:39,717
That could be anybody's dog.
It's too hot.

779
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,587
You know you're hot.

786
00:49:01,139 --> 00:49:05,343
[Trucky] i didn't wanna leave pootie,
but i wasn't trying to hear all that survival shit.

787
00:49:05,376 --> 00:49:08,513
Outback, my ass.
I need conveniences, man.

788
00:49:08,546 --> 00:49:12,183
On the other hand,
pootie was lovin' every minute of it.

789
00:49:12,217 --> 00:49:16,054
He was rejuvenated.
You hear that? Rejuvenated.

790
00:49:16,087 --> 00:49:18,223
He was "juvenated" before,
lost it...

791
00:49:18,256 --> 00:49:21,659
And got "juvenated" again.

792
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:23,661
* That lasts

793
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:26,031

And when pootie planted
his first cornstalk,

798
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:40,078
- Damie.
- He was happy.

799
00:49:40,111 --> 00:49:43,581
Too damn happy, if you ask me.
It was just corn.

00:49:53,391 --> 00:49:55,093

Hi, daddy.
Not now, stacy, honey.

807
00:50:06,637 --> 00:50:10,275
Listen. There's a new fella here in town.
He's coming in here in a minute.

808
00:50:10,308 --> 00:50:11,776
So?

809
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:15,646
So? So maybe you can
marry him, that's what so.

810
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,582
Aw, daddy!

811
00:50:17,615 --> 00:50:21,686
Oh, come on.
Cut that shit out, stacy.

812
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:25,123

My damie.
[Shrieks]

819
00:50:50,848 --> 00:50:52,683
Oh!

820
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:57,755
And she's a looker,
ain't she? Huh?

821
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:09,134

Thank you.

825
00:51:18,276 --> 00:51:20,645
I wanna talk to you
about pootie tang.

826

You mean public enemy number one in my world.

00:51:24,149 --> 00:51:26,351
[All laughing]

828
00:51:26,384 --> 00:51:28,686
Huh? Right?

829
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:30,788
We learned that anything
can be addictive.

830
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:35,726
We took our burgers and
pumped them so full of m.S.D...

831
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,730
That people can't even
taste real food anymore.

832
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:43,601
Today american kids don't eat
'cause they're hungry.

833
00:51:43,634 --> 00:51:49,574
They eat 'cause they just gotta
have another lecter burger.

834
00:51:49,807 --> 00:51:51,609
You see,
i own pootie's name.

835
00:51:51,642 --> 00:51:55,280
He's mine.
I don't need him to sell my products anymore...

836
00:51:55,313 --> 00:51:58,483
Because i've got thousands of them all over the country.

837
00:51:58,516 --> 00:52:04,555
I'm just gonna give them the
clothes and this training tape.

838
00:52:04,589 --> 00:52:07,392
And remember, when making
a public appearance,

839
00:52:07,425 --> 00:52:12,363
Pootie tang always
struts like this.

840
00:52:15,533 --> 00:52:22,273
Next week we're opening a brand-New
nationwide chain of burger stands.

841
00:52:24,509 --> 00:52:27,312
Pootie's
bad time burgers.

842
00:52:27,345 --> 00:52:30,215
As a matter of fact,
the only thing that could mess up our little party...

843
00:52:30,248 --> 00:52:33,418
Is if the real pootie
showed up.

844
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:36,354
But that ain't
good enough.

845
00:52:37,288 --> 00:52:39,557
I want him dead.
[Dirty dee] yeah.

846
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:44,262
I'd like to put that bitch in the ground myself,
but i ain't magical.

847
00:52:44,295 --> 00:52:46,231
I been tryin' to get
that pootie for years.

848
00:52:46,264 --> 00:52:50,268
He done jailed or offed all my boys.
All i got left is froggy.

849
00:52:50,301 --> 00:52:53,338
Nobody know
where pootie's at.

850
00:52:53,371 --> 00:52:55,973
I know where he's at.

851
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,942
I got people
everywhere, baby.

852
00:52:57,975 --> 00:53:01,679
Nobody can hide
from corporate america.

853
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:04,882
And as far
as how to beat him,

854
00:53:06,451 --> 00:53:09,920
Maybe this will help.

855
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:14,592
[Stacy]
hello?

856
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:17,562
Hello? [Trucky] uh-Oh.
Look at this.

857
00:53:17,595 --> 00:53:19,997
Remember her? That's stacy,
the sheriff's daughter.

858
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:23,901
He's been trying to get her ass
married since she was 12 years old.

859
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:26,737
Hello?
Is anybody here?

860
00:53:26,771 --> 00:53:29,607
Hello?

861
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:33,578
Hello?

862
00:53:33,611 --> 00:53:38,949
Why, um--
I-I'm sorry. I, uh--

863
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:47,224
Well, i-I made you
a pie... cake. Um--

864
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:53,364
D-D-Do you want
the pie?

865
00:53:54,999 --> 00:53:57,435
Ohh.

866
00:53:57,468 --> 00:54:03,308
I-I-I know
i'm not pretty or--

867
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:08,646
Or sexy.
Y-Y-You--

868
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:15,653
You probably like a...
sexy girl, right?

869
00:54:30,801 --> 00:54:32,803
Baby,

870
00:54:32,837 --> 00:54:38,008
I'm gonna sine your pitty
on the runny kine.

871
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:42,279
[Screaming]

872
00:54:44,649 --> 00:54:47,818
[Moaning, grunting]

873
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:53,491
Now, see, that's what makes
pootie tang a real hero.

874
00:54:53,524 --> 00:54:56,327
He can't stand by and see
a woman not lovin' herself.

875
00:54:56,361 --> 00:54:58,529
He's gonna put
the love in her.

876
00:54:58,563 --> 00:55:01,866
Now, me, i say just
give her a compliment.

877
00:55:01,899 --> 00:55:05,002
Hey, i like your shoes.
Have you been workin' out?

878
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:07,838
Girl, what you doin'
with your hair?

879
00:55:07,872 --> 00:55:10,741
But i tell you what,

880
00:55:10,775 --> 00:55:15,980
I'm only gonna buy this hero shit but so many times.

881
00:55:16,013 --> 00:55:19,684
[Trucky] back in the big city,
all hell was breaking loose.

882
00:55:19,717 --> 00:55:22,119
I'm talking about
drug dealin', drug usin',

883
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,822
Booty shakin',
too much damn tv,

884
00:55:24,855 --> 00:55:28,826
Drinkin', people eating too much,
gettin' all fat and sloppy,

885
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:32,697
Fightin', kids out of school,
ain't nobody readin',

886
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:34,832
People actin'
a straight damn fool.

887
00:55:34,865 --> 00:55:36,901
And corporate america
was just loving it.

888
00:55:36,934 --> 00:55:39,604
Look at them.
It's a party now.

889
00:55:39,637 --> 00:55:43,140
Since he left, it just changed.
Everything just went bonkers.

890
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,976
Everybody lost their mind
and what not.

891
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:47,745
Pootie tang,
you shouldn't do this.

892
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:51,416
You should come back to the city,
where you belong.

893
00:55:55,486 --> 00:55:57,855
[Trucky] back on the farm,
the worst happened.

894
00:55:57,888 --> 00:56:00,525
Pootie tang's cornstalk died.

895
00:56:00,558 --> 00:56:02,527
And for the third time
in his life,

896
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:05,730
Pootie lost the only thing
that was important to him.

897
00:56:05,763 --> 00:56:10,535
First his family, then his belt,
and now his corn died.

898
00:56:10,568 --> 00:56:13,037
Farm life was
driving pootie crazy.

899
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:15,640
He must have lost his damn mind.
Look at him.

900
00:56:15,673 --> 00:56:18,776
Down on his knees,
crying over a piece of corn.

901
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:22,713
Not even popcorn.
Regular damn corn.

902
00:56:22,747 --> 00:56:24,749
Pootie tang had lost all hope,

903
00:56:24,782 --> 00:56:28,653
And it was gonna take
a miracle to bring him back.

904
00:56:29,654 --> 00:56:32,790
[Daddy tang]
pootie.

905
00:56:32,823 --> 00:56:35,826
Pootie tang!

906
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:47,672
Up here, pootie.

907
00:57:04,689 --> 00:57:07,625
Hey, watch the leaves.

908
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:13,197
Daddy?
You damn right i'm your daddy.

909
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:16,634
Pootie, what you doin' runnin' away from your problems?

910
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:18,669
- Did i teach you like that?
- [Mumbling]

911
00:57:18,703 --> 00:57:20,671
Hey, don't you
mumble, boy!

912
00:57:20,705 --> 00:57:23,040
[Cowbells ringing]
pootie, my boy.

913
00:57:23,073 --> 00:57:24,975
Mama di.

914
00:57:25,009 --> 00:57:28,813
Pootie, you're a good man.
I'm proud of you.

915
00:57:28,846 --> 00:57:33,784
You have so much love in you,
and you can give it like a gift.

916
00:57:33,818 --> 00:57:37,822
Your father was wrong to tell
you to guard it like a secret.

917
00:57:37,855 --> 00:57:41,258
- W-W-What was that?
- Shut your mouth!

918
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:45,129
- Woman!
- You corn-Ass fool!

919
00:57:46,597 --> 00:57:50,267
Pootie, teach the world
right from wrong,

920
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,738
But love the world
at the same time.

921
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:55,706
That's the key.

922
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:57,575
Where's your belt, boy?

923
00:57:57,608 --> 00:57:59,577
You let some girl
get your belt.

924
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:02,212
You let the ladies
get your belt.

925
00:58:02,246 --> 00:58:05,816
I knew that would happen.
Now you done lost all your confidence.

926
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:09,053
I'll tell you something, pootie,
ain't nothing special about that belt.

927
00:58:09,086 --> 00:58:12,022
I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.

928
00:58:12,056 --> 00:58:14,091
You don't never need
that belt, boy,

929
00:58:14,124 --> 00:58:16,594
'Cause you got
the goodness in your heart.

930
00:58:16,627 --> 00:58:19,697
Now you need to go out there
and take that and kick some ass.

931
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:23,601
[Mumbling] hey,
don't you mumble, boy!

932
00:58:23,634 --> 00:58:25,603
Now, go out there,
take that goodness...

933
00:58:25,636 --> 00:58:27,237
And teach the world
right from wrong.

934
00:58:27,271 --> 00:58:30,107
Now git!

935
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:55,800
I, uh--

936
00:58:55,833 --> 00:59:00,037
I think maybe you and me
got something to talk about.

937
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:01,772
I, uh--

938
00:59:01,806 --> 00:59:06,877
I understand you and stacy there...
[clears throat]

939
00:59:06,911 --> 00:59:08,813
Got to know
each other, huh?

940
00:59:08,846 --> 00:59:11,782
[Bell dings]

941
00:59:16,687 --> 00:59:19,056
Had yourself
a little time there, eh?

942
00:59:19,089 --> 00:59:22,960
Huh? Huh?

943
00:59:23,761 --> 00:59:27,097
Yeah.
[Laughing]

944
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:33,904
Oh, that's terrific!
Well, partner,

945
00:59:33,938 --> 00:59:36,707
When's the wedding, huh?

946
00:59:37,842 --> 00:59:39,677
Huh?

947
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:41,345
[Clicks]

948
00:59:41,378 --> 00:59:45,082
Like i say, i sure would
be mighty proud...

949
00:59:45,115 --> 00:59:47,818
To have you

Oh! That had to hurt his ass!

01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:18,876
Slap him like a bitch!

Pow-Ya! Ooh!

01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,109
Then i finally remembered
he was at the farm.

995
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:35,245
All this time i had been talking about the farm.
[Horn honks]

996
01:03:35,279 --> 01:03:38,615
How the hell did i forget
he was at the damn farm?

997
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:41,886
Anyway, i got there
just in the nick of time.

998
01:03:41,919 --> 01:03:44,521
Oh, pootie, you got
to come back to the city...

Right now.
What's the dabble, di?

Hey, there's a wedding

Man, they are using
your face, man.

1002
01:03:51,896 --> 01:03:54,899
They're making you sell these products, man,
