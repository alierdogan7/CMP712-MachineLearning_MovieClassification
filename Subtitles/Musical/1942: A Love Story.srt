1
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,300
Forgive me, Mother.
I could do nothing for you.

2
00:02:53,538 --> 00:02:56,473
You're sacrificing your life
for your Motherland.

3
00:02:56,507 --> 00:03:01,001
What more can you do for me?

4
00:03:03,181 --> 00:03:05,342
Go, son.

5
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,287
Long Live, India.

6
00:03:20,965 --> 00:03:23,433
The General will still pardon you.

7
00:03:23,634 --> 00:03:26,728
Tell him the whereabouts of
the traitors and save yourself.

8
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:29,103
I know just one traitor.

9
00:03:29,841 --> 00:03:32,002
And that's you!

10
00:04:15,286 --> 00:04:20,314
Long Live, India!

11
00:05:30,027 --> 00:05:33,292
1 942 - 9th August

12
00:05:33,831 --> 00:05:38,097
In every corner of India,
there was but one echo...

13
00:05:39,804 --> 00:05:44,867
Quit India!
We'll do, or die.

14
00:05:45,242 --> 00:05:48,439
As the Independence Movement spread,

15
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,745
...the atrocities of
the British worsened.

16
00:05:53,117 --> 00:05:57,019
The man behind them
was General Douglas.

17
00:05:57,388 --> 00:06:00,482
Who murdered many
unarmed men.

18
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:05,427
And hung many a freedom fighter.

19
00:06:05,763 --> 00:06:08,698
But even in death,
they had but one thing to say.

20
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:11,529
''We'll do, or die!''

21
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:17,632
''We'll do, or die!''

22
00:06:40,865 --> 00:06:44,494
''1 2 dead in Delhi
in police-firing''

23
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:51,198
- They razed the whole town.
- Easy. Go on reading.

24
00:06:54,712 --> 00:06:58,648
General Douglas is going back
to England on the 25th...

25
00:06:59,884 --> 00:07:01,818
...on promotion!

26
00:07:02,153 --> 00:07:07,648
If I had my way,
I'd hang the bloody dog!

27
00:07:11,328 --> 00:07:13,592
Carry on reading.

28
00:07:14,498 --> 00:07:19,834
Before that,there'll be a Regimental
Farewell Parade at Kasauni.

29
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:24,439
How long will he be there?

30
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,079
For a day. Just one day.

31
00:07:30,414 --> 00:07:32,575
One day, eh?

32
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:37,448
There's Govind there.
And Mr Baig too.

33
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:41,185
This is the only chance
to finish him off!.

34
00:07:41,692 --> 00:07:45,492
The General will go to Kasauni...
but, never return!

35
00:07:45,696 --> 00:07:48,597
- Father, this is my...
- No, son.

36
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:54,137
Only one man for this job!
...Shubhankar!

37
00:07:54,638 --> 00:08:00,406
You can help him. But first,
I'll go there myself.

38
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:02,910
To make the bomb.

39
00:08:03,781 --> 00:08:07,478
Inform Govind today itself.

40
00:08:08,552 --> 00:08:11,214
But don't tell him anything
about the mission.

41
00:08:13,657 --> 00:08:15,488
Just say, I'm not keeping well.

42
00:08:16,093 --> 00:08:20,462
So I'm coming there for treatment.
Very soon.

43
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:12,941
It has sprouted here too, eh?

44
00:09:13,384 --> 00:09:17,844
Great! Just listen to them;
We'll do, or die.

45
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:20,584
More will die, than do, sir.

46
00:09:20,624 --> 00:09:23,024
Then what are you waiting for?
Shoot them.

47
00:09:23,227 --> 00:09:24,785
They too must know
the repercussions of...

48
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:27,957
...raising their voice
against the British Raj.

49
00:09:28,032 --> 00:09:31,866
And this is being done because
the General is coming here.

50
00:09:35,606 --> 00:09:37,164
Some trouble's brewing.

51
00:09:37,908 --> 00:09:41,002
It's not the General who's coming,
but some calamity.

52
00:09:41,512 --> 00:09:45,312
Let it be the General or Hitler.
What's it to you? Just shut up!

53
00:09:45,783 --> 00:09:50,345
How can I? Firing in Delhi;
Curfew in Old Delhi.

54
00:09:50,788 --> 00:09:54,246
Women raped by soldiers, and you
exxpect me to keep quiet?

55
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:58,694
If ever this man crosses my path,
I swear, I'll spit on him.

56
00:09:58,729 --> 00:10:03,257
He'll be here nextx week.
Spit on him and fulfill your wish.

57
00:10:03,634 --> 00:10:06,660
I'll do that, if your father
doesn't kill me first!

58
00:10:06,804 --> 00:10:08,635
Put your tail in, eh?

59
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,401
Coward!
Spit on Douglas, will you?

60
00:10:26,123 --> 00:10:29,684
If I had my way,
I'll kill each one of them!

61
00:10:30,027 --> 00:10:34,054
This fire has been ignited
by some outsiders.

62
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:39,294
As long as I'm the C.O. here,
nobody will dare to commit treason.

63
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:49,145
It won't last...
the British Rule won't last long.

64
00:11:00,057 --> 00:11:03,322
Pull that flag down.

65
00:11:04,094 --> 00:11:05,823
Lower that flag.

66
00:11:21,312 --> 00:11:22,939
Push them back!

67
00:11:48,205 --> 00:11:50,400
Hey!
Look what's happening.

68
00:12:08,726 --> 00:12:11,217
Stop him! Go, man.

69
00:13:14,024 --> 00:13:17,221
What are you doing? Gone mad?
Your father's livid. Let's go.

70
00:13:19,897 --> 00:13:25,392
You should be ashamed!
My son, doing such a thing?

71
00:13:25,803 --> 00:13:31,298
I'll not put up with this at all.
At least think of my reputation.

72
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,608
If you're dying for
Independence too...

73
00:13:34,845 --> 00:13:37,245
...then remove
the Western clothes.

74
00:13:37,548 --> 00:13:41,348
Wear Khadi ones, and stand at
crossroads and shout slogans!

75
00:13:43,287 --> 00:13:45,517
Did you hear what I said?

76
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:55,830
They are here again?

77
00:13:55,966 --> 00:14:00,096
The Government has confiscated their
land and money. They'll starve.

78
00:14:00,337 --> 00:14:04,467
When their son was siding with the
traitors, were they sleeping?

79
00:14:04,741 --> 00:14:08,837
If you allow them in here again,
you'll be out! Understand?

80
00:14:25,262 --> 00:14:27,594
What's happened?
What has never happened before!

81
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:29,926
Fights, riots, madness!

82
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:35,472
Here I am, trying to hold on to my
status and there,your darling son...

83
00:14:35,472 --> 00:14:38,942
- What about him?
- Gets beaten up by a constable!

84
00:14:38,942 --> 00:14:41,240
Heavens!
He's not hurt, is he?

85
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,617
You're alright, aren't you, son?

86
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,391
Hey! She's not here.

87
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,295
But I know where she is.

88
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,700
- Where?
- It was lying here.

89
00:15:42,873 --> 00:15:45,933
Does this ear-ring belong
to somebody close to you?

90
00:15:46,443 --> 00:15:49,879
Yes; it does.

91
00:16:01,692 --> 00:16:03,927
Where had you gone
with this horse?

92
00:16:03,927 --> 00:16:06,452
To find her...the girl in the bus.

93
00:16:06,496 --> 00:16:09,465
- What bus and which girl?
- That bus in the Town's square.

94
00:16:10,434 --> 00:16:14,768
Whose glass was stoned; that's when
I saw her and kept on staring.

95
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:18,033
I must admire your sight.

96
00:16:18,108 --> 00:16:24,147
In all that riot, noise, stoning, you
saw someone, and kept on looking...

97
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:26,843
- Don't laugh; but come with me.
- How can I?

98
00:16:26,883 --> 00:16:29,716
Come home tomorrow.
We'll find her by afternoon.

99
00:16:29,753 --> 00:16:33,780
Our town's so small. Nobody can get
lost, even if one wishes to!

100
00:16:34,224 --> 00:16:37,318
Tomorrow it is!
Come now.

101
00:16:38,262 --> 00:16:39,957
Where are you running me off to?

102
00:16:42,232 --> 00:16:44,462
May I ask you something?

103
00:16:44,801 --> 00:16:47,929
When the whole country's burning,
how could you think of love?

104
00:16:48,005 --> 00:16:53,944
If everyone thought of Love, why
would India burn at all? See this?

105
00:16:54,211 --> 00:16:57,669
Great! People pick pockets. Did
you cut-off somebody's ears?

106
00:16:58,015 --> 00:17:01,280
By this, you can imagine how
the wearer must be!

107
00:17:01,551 --> 00:17:04,679
I could guess wrongly,
so better tell me yourself.

108
00:17:05,055 --> 00:17:07,615
Very beautiful. In fact, even
that doesn't do justice to it.

109
00:17:07,891 --> 00:17:10,826
When I saw her,
it was as though...

110
00:17:11,295 --> 00:17:14,093
You understand, don't you?
I'll exxplain it.

111
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:19,159
- I saw her, and...
- I got that. Go on.

112
00:17:19,269 --> 00:17:24,002
When I saw her,
I felt as though...

113
00:17:24,241 --> 00:17:28,837
Do one thing. Think all night and
tell me when you come tomorrow. Bye!

114
00:17:31,148 --> 00:17:36,814
Hey! When I saw her, it was
as though...as though what?

115
00:22:15,265 --> 00:22:19,292
How come you found your way here
so early today?

116
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:24,664
You're getting worried, but he's
hardly aware of the time and duty.

117
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:31,074
You're too lenient with him.
As they say...

118
00:22:31,281 --> 00:22:35,911
When a mouse finds a turmeric-root,
it thinks itself to be a grocer!

119
00:22:36,453 --> 00:22:37,852
Open the door, friend.

120
00:22:38,888 --> 00:22:43,791
His door may break,
but he won't wake!

121
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:54,361
Show affection to someone,
who's worth the trouble. Understand?

122
00:23:21,998 --> 00:23:23,590
Let's go...

123
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:29,366
Let's go, I say.
Where are you?

124
00:23:34,411 --> 00:23:36,709
- What's the matter? Let's go.
- Where to?

125
00:23:36,946 --> 00:23:39,915
- To look for that girl. Where else?
- But I found her.

126
00:23:40,016 --> 00:23:43,349
- Found her? Where?
- Up There.

127
00:23:44,654 --> 00:23:48,818
This one? Is this the cartoon
you saw and lost your heart to?

128
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:50,786
She's Aunty!

129
00:23:51,861 --> 00:23:54,694
Whom have you fallen for?

130
00:23:59,102 --> 00:24:00,330
Tea, father.

131
00:24:06,209 --> 00:24:08,734
- What's wrong?
- I'm alright. You go.

132
00:24:11,815 --> 00:24:14,875
Have you told her?

133
00:24:15,618 --> 00:24:18,086
No, I haven't.

134
00:24:18,822 --> 00:24:20,983
She has suffered enough already.

135
00:24:21,524 --> 00:24:24,652
And this mission is so dangerous,
she'll worry unnecessarily.

136
00:24:24,728 --> 00:24:26,821
You did well.

137
00:24:27,163 --> 00:24:31,725
I told my wife that you're
here to take treatment.

138
00:24:32,268 --> 00:24:35,499
She got worried.
She said ask him to stay with us.

139
00:24:35,572 --> 00:24:37,972
- Else, I'd have...
- No, this room will do.

140
00:24:38,108 --> 00:24:43,705
I'll be coughing away here and
nobody will disturb us.

141
00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:53,082
My wife wants to
go to her Mother's.

142
00:24:53,757 --> 00:24:58,160
- Why?
- After 1 2 years...

143
00:24:58,194 --> 00:24:59,923
...God has smiled on her.

144
00:25:00,897 --> 00:25:03,058
She's pregnant.

145
00:25:03,767 --> 00:25:09,069
Really? That's good news.
Congratulations.

146
00:25:14,043 --> 00:25:17,171
- These books?
- They're my daughter's.

147
00:25:17,647 --> 00:25:21,447
- A voracious reader. Pens poems too.
- Really?

148
00:25:22,685 --> 00:25:25,245
We've a good library here.

149
00:25:25,622 --> 00:25:28,022
Good!
Then she'll be happy here.

150
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:33,187
When I go to Abid Ali,
I'll drop her here.

151
00:25:34,164 --> 00:25:37,793
- Coming; You're up, are you?
- What are you eating on the sly?

152
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:41,767
- Have some. It's Holy offering.
- Give some to Master Naren too.

153
00:25:42,272 --> 00:25:44,206
- What's this?
- Don't get scared.

154
00:25:44,707 --> 00:25:47,699
He's the driver
of an aristocrat.

155
00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:50,905
Very fond ofjust one thing.
Non-stop chatter!

156
00:25:51,314 --> 00:25:55,683
I'll do one thing.
I'll tell him about your illness.

157
00:25:56,052 --> 00:26:00,682
By evening, the whole town will know
you're here for treatment.

158
00:26:04,494 --> 00:26:07,224
Father, your medicine.

159
00:26:20,343 --> 00:26:22,106
Careful, my dear friend.

160
00:26:23,146 --> 00:26:25,979
Never mind the father.
Tell me about the daughter.

161
00:26:26,015 --> 00:26:30,820
She must be able to support herself.
She's gone to the library.

162
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,812
Hold on. I lied for you for
the first time in my life.

163
00:26:33,857 --> 00:26:36,993
Actually it opens at 9 A.M.
But I told him, at 8 A.M.

164
00:26:36,993 --> 00:26:41,453
The watchman there is related to me.
Bribe him and he'll open it earlier.

165
00:26:41,598 --> 00:26:44,434
After that, it's just you and her.
On that first meeting...

166
00:26:44,434 --> 00:26:47,562
Recite a lovely couplet to her,
like my uncle had recited.

167
00:26:47,604 --> 00:26:51,741
My aunt was drying her hair
in the sun, and my uncle...

168
00:26:51,741 --> 00:26:55,609
Let me go, please.
No poetry.

169
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:44,454
I just knew you'd come here
in search of knowledge.

170
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:47,496
This library is a
Trove of Knowledge.

171
00:27:47,764 --> 00:27:52,827
Books? These are scientific.
They tell, why the sky is blue.

172
00:27:53,236 --> 00:27:57,730
And these are of literature, telling
why did Juliette love Romeo!

173
00:27:58,741 --> 00:28:04,441
And these are of accounts,
that tell this is our 3rd meeting.

174
00:28:05,148 --> 00:28:09,585
Yesterday, in the bus. Today morning
on the swing; And now, here.

175
00:28:10,253 --> 00:28:13,780
Since we're discussing accounts,
naturally one wishes to know...

176
00:28:13,823 --> 00:28:18,760
Who are you; Where you've come
from...and also what is your name!

177
00:28:32,075 --> 00:28:34,600
Are you the librarian here?

178
00:28:35,979 --> 00:28:40,006
Do I seem one to you?
Anyway, you at least enquired.

179
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,875
Now ask me, where I come from,
and my name too!

180
00:28:43,553 --> 00:28:45,453
Go on, ask me.

181
00:28:45,989 --> 00:28:48,981
- Let go of me.
- Go on, ask.

182
00:28:49,492 --> 00:28:54,794
I have one thing of yours which you
will get, only if you ask me my name.

183
00:28:55,098 --> 00:28:56,622
- Let me go.
- Ask me my name then.

184
00:28:56,666 --> 00:28:59,134
What impertinence!
Let me go.

185
00:28:59,168 --> 00:29:02,501
You're cross over such a small issue?
Go on, ask me.

186
00:33:38,147 --> 00:33:41,344
Look at the ironies of life.
We both yearned to meet.

187
00:33:42,084 --> 00:33:45,019
And when we are, it's on the sly,
like a couple of thieves!

188
00:33:45,588 --> 00:33:47,852
- Nobody saw you come?
- No.

189
00:33:51,427 --> 00:33:55,329
The General has a very tight
security. But one thing is certain.

190
00:33:55,498 --> 00:33:58,524
He'll definitely attend the drama,
we're presenting to welcome him.

191
00:33:58,734 --> 00:34:02,033
He'll be in the balcony.
It's a difficultjob, no doubt.

192
00:34:02,271 --> 00:34:03,898
- Shubhankar is coming, isn't he?
- Yes.

193
00:34:14,984 --> 00:34:19,853
Here's the raw material for the bomb.
And this is the map of the hall.

194
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:24,949
- Is your daughter with you?
- Yes, but she doesn't know this.

195
00:34:25,061 --> 00:34:30,829
Good! Send her to the rehearsal
and send me the news through her.

196
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,164
- Now we'll not meet again.
- Is this a final one then?

197
00:34:35,237 --> 00:34:36,761
God forbid!

198
00:34:39,775 --> 00:34:43,233
- Victory to India!
- Amen!

199
00:35:09,071 --> 00:35:11,266
Who is it?
Just one minute.

200
00:35:20,549 --> 00:35:23,484
- Why did you close the door?
- I felt very cold.

201
00:35:23,886 --> 00:35:25,945
Keep it here.

202
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:31,782
- Lovely!
- Come on now, start eating.

203
00:35:32,395 --> 00:35:35,796
- You look very happy.
- It's a lovely place.

204
00:35:36,165 --> 00:35:38,633
- I feel like staying here only.
- Then do.

205
00:35:39,201 --> 00:35:40,998
The library's good too, I hear.

206
00:35:41,437 --> 00:35:44,770
Such a library, such books...

207
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,809
Such people even.
Never seen before.

208
00:35:49,912 --> 00:35:53,746
You had gone to see Uncle Baig.
How is he?

209
00:35:54,116 --> 00:35:57,916
Fine. He's busy with a play.
Has called you for assistance.

210
00:35:57,953 --> 00:36:01,855
- Me?
- Yes. Tomorrow, at 1 0 A.M.

211
00:36:02,324 --> 00:36:05,384
And tell him he has forgotten to
give me the white medicine.

212
00:36:05,728 --> 00:36:09,255
Good! You at least found time here,
to think of your treatment.

213
00:36:09,965 --> 00:36:13,196
You'll get well here soon.
I just feel it.

214
00:36:15,938 --> 00:36:19,465
- Why does aunty shout so?
- But she means well. So go now.

215
00:36:31,654 --> 00:36:34,487
One soldier on that balcony
and another one here.

216
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,581
You on that gate, and you,
on the other.

217
00:36:38,894 --> 00:36:42,091
Ten soldiers in the hall.
Four soldiers up here.

218
00:36:42,164 --> 00:36:44,894
And you shall be at the gate
with your whole platoon.

219
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:49,298
- Wonderful! Don't trust me even?
- Am I mad, sir?

220
00:36:49,672 --> 00:36:51,765
Do I want to invite my death
by suspecting you?

221
00:36:51,807 --> 00:36:54,469
- Then why are you here?
- Just for security.

222
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:59,815
Ever since the general's arrival,
the treachery is on the rise.

223
00:36:59,815 --> 00:37:05,117
Where everyone knows each other,
nobody will dare come.

224
00:37:05,387 --> 00:37:08,550
You don't know their guts.

225
00:37:09,325 --> 00:37:13,819
There's a revolutionary
present here itself.

226
00:37:13,896 --> 00:37:16,194
What? Who?

227
00:37:17,633 --> 00:37:19,498
See over there.

228
00:37:23,906 --> 00:37:30,937
Here? She's a sweet, promising and
a decent girl. Acts well too.

229
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,472
Who'll guess she's your kid?

230
00:37:36,418 --> 00:37:39,387
You teachers leave nobody!
Not even your friends.

231
00:37:39,688 --> 00:37:44,250
What was that couplet you recited?
''O friend, you're my foe...''

232
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,887
''Any man,
whom you befriend...''

233
00:37:48,097 --> 00:37:51,897
''Why should the
sky be his foe?''

234
00:37:53,235 --> 00:37:54,930
Please go!
We're getting late here.

235
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:58,371
I've to go on some
urgent errand too.

236
00:37:58,641 --> 00:38:02,407
Alright, my dear. See sir?
She calls the shots even here!

237
00:38:02,945 --> 00:38:04,913
God bless you!

238
00:38:06,682 --> 00:38:08,741
Why don't you understand?
I must go.

239
00:38:08,784 --> 00:38:12,117
- She must've come. You manage here.
-Manage, my foot! Will I play Romeo?

240
00:38:12,154 --> 00:38:15,224
- Where are you going?
- It's imperative that I go.

241
00:38:15,224 --> 00:38:18,887
The rehearsal's important too.
You're forgetting the lines, not me.

242
00:38:18,994 --> 00:38:21,462
You talk of books?
He's forgotten his name!

243
00:38:21,764 --> 00:38:25,427
- Books? What books?
- The one with lines in them.

244
00:38:25,768 --> 00:38:28,760
- Keep jabbering. I'm going!
- Stop him!

245
00:38:29,738 --> 00:38:31,729
I can't! I must go.

246
00:38:31,907 --> 00:38:35,468
- What's the urgency for books?
- You won't understand.

247
00:38:46,388 --> 00:38:48,754
Go on then...
Why did you stop?

248
00:38:52,061 --> 00:38:53,961
When is the General coming?

249
00:38:54,363 --> 00:38:57,355
- Yes, when is he exxpected?
- Nextx week. Why?

250
00:38:57,399 --> 00:39:00,197
And I'm leaving? We're doing
this for him, aren't we?

251
00:39:00,502 --> 00:39:05,064
You're right. I must learn my lines.
I don't know why I forget them.

252
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:09,568
- The General will sit here...
- Baig Uncle.

253
00:39:10,546 --> 00:39:13,606
- My dear! How are you?
- I'm fine.

254
00:39:13,749 --> 00:39:18,311
That are you! If you help me in this,
I'll say you're even finer!

255
00:39:18,687 --> 00:39:22,024
Uncle, daddy said...

256
00:39:22,024 --> 00:39:22,854
- Do I put some flowers here too?
- Yes, all over.

257
00:39:25,194 --> 00:39:26,627
Yes, what did he say?

258
00:39:26,762 --> 00:39:29,526
He said you forgot
the white medicine.

259
00:39:29,565 --> 00:39:33,001
Tell him, I'll send it today.

260
00:39:33,235 --> 00:39:38,263
Take this. The actors always forget
their lines. Prompt them, please.

261
00:39:42,478 --> 00:39:46,505
Put phosphorous in a medicine bottle
and give it to Mr Pathak.

262
00:39:46,582 --> 00:39:49,278
- Tell him, when Shubhankar arrives..
- Is he coming?

263
00:39:49,818 --> 00:39:54,448
This moon shines through you.
Shall I swear by it?

264
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:58,954
No. It waxxes and wanes.
Don't swear by it.

265
00:39:59,495 --> 00:40:04,330
I believe in you.
My body, mind and life...

266
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,033
- What are the following lines?
- Lines?

267
00:40:09,171 --> 00:40:12,004
But what's your name, dearest?

268
00:40:14,076 --> 00:40:18,445
Knowing name is not knowing a person.
It's just a name, not a virtue.

269
00:40:18,614 --> 00:40:21,515
Had the rose been known as a thorn,
it would still smell as sweetly.

270
00:40:21,684 --> 00:40:24,414
If water had been called fire,
it'd still be cool.

271
00:40:24,653 --> 00:40:27,087
Change my name, if you will,
but I'll still be the same.

272
00:40:27,289 --> 00:40:31,055
I'll always love you...
what's the nextx line?

273
00:40:32,061 --> 00:40:35,030
- ''Because you are you...''
- Yes.

274
00:40:35,564 --> 00:40:38,158
Because you are you.

275
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:44,270
I know that it
wasn't an act.

276
00:40:46,108 --> 00:40:48,542
It was your love for me.

277
00:40:49,378 --> 00:40:53,178
How easily you put across
your true feelings.

278
00:40:53,849 --> 00:40:58,513
And I...I don't even
know your name.

279
00:41:05,527 --> 00:41:10,294
You know I wasn't acting.
It was my love. For you.

280
00:41:13,168 --> 00:41:15,568
You! What are you doing here?
Go away.

281
00:41:15,637 --> 00:41:20,074
- You didn't ask me my name.
- Softly. They'll wake up. Go now.

282
00:41:20,109 --> 00:41:24,637
- I'll come up then.
- What the hell! Don't come up.

283
00:41:25,214 --> 00:41:29,810
Don't come up, I said.
You'll fall!

284
00:41:40,796 --> 00:41:45,665
Don't ever let go of this hand.
Else, I'll die.

285
00:41:46,769 --> 00:41:49,533
- Don't say that.
- Okay, I won't.

286
00:41:50,172 --> 00:41:54,074
Just let me look at you
to my heart's content.

287
00:41:54,276 --> 00:41:57,404
Those lips; these eyes;

288
00:41:59,715 --> 00:42:01,080
These eyelashes...

289
00:42:15,364 --> 00:42:18,299
Leave me. Go away.
Somebody may wake up. Go!

290
00:42:18,433 --> 00:42:21,527
Okay.
But promise to come early tomorrow.

291
00:42:21,737 --> 00:42:23,864
- Where?
- The Rehearsal Hall.

292
00:42:23,906 --> 00:42:29,105
- Okay, I'll come a bit early.
- Not a bit early; before everyone.

293
00:42:29,278 --> 00:42:32,645
- Okay, go now. Someone may hear.
- How can I go?

294
00:42:32,948 --> 00:42:36,247
- Why not?
- You're holding on to my hand.

295
00:42:40,322 --> 00:42:42,017
- Listen...
- Yes?

296
00:42:42,591 --> 00:42:44,559
- You didn't tell me.
- What?

297
00:42:45,561 --> 00:42:47,927
- Your name?
- My name?

298
00:48:37,078 --> 00:48:40,741
We've got a message from the H.Q.
There's a plot to kill the General.

299
00:48:41,116 --> 00:48:44,916
Some are here; and more exxpected.
They also have material for a bomb.

300
00:48:45,387 --> 00:48:48,584
The H.Q. have requested
the Army for help.

301
00:48:51,426 --> 00:48:56,955
Call an officer's meeting at once
and arm the 2 companies concerned.

302
00:50:07,736 --> 00:50:09,169
Careful.

303
00:50:54,482 --> 00:50:58,316
Tell Mr Baig that
the job is done.

304
00:50:59,154 --> 00:51:01,679
Keep the bomb here
in this room.

305
00:51:02,824 --> 00:51:06,161
It's raining heavily.
The roads are teeming with police.

306
00:51:06,161 --> 00:51:09,931
They're searching all the houses.
Our friends are exxpected. What now?

307
00:51:09,931 --> 00:51:13,230
Get a hold of yourself!.
Let's go.

308
00:51:14,135 --> 00:51:16,365
Carry on with the rehearsal.
I'll be back soon.

309
00:51:16,438 --> 00:51:18,929
Right, Sir.
Come on, let's get on with it.

310
00:51:20,342 --> 00:51:25,302
- Someone will snatch you from me...
- Who can dare to do that?

311
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,945
Has anyone ever snatched life from
one's body? Sleep from the eyes...

312
00:51:29,017 --> 00:51:31,815
And thirst from the lips?

313
00:51:32,454 --> 00:51:35,657
Time can, if it wills.

314
00:51:35,657 --> 00:51:41,220
No! That's not true! I'll snatch
you from Time itself then.

315
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:46,927
- Promise me Rajjo...
- I'm not Rajjo, Naren.

316
00:51:47,836 --> 00:51:51,294
It's just that...

317
00:52:00,715 --> 00:52:06,176
Wait!
Please listen to me.

318
00:52:07,088 --> 00:52:11,388
Forgive me, but don't blame me.
Blame my love.

319
00:52:11,926 --> 00:52:14,224
Is it necessary
to flaunt love?

320
00:52:14,662 --> 00:52:18,154
I wasn't flaunting.
They were my true feelings.

321
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,335
And I truly love you.

322
00:52:21,803 --> 00:52:23,896
I can't live without you.

323
00:52:25,573 --> 00:52:29,669
Will you marry me?

324
00:56:51,372 --> 00:56:55,775
Rajjo was right. I'm just coming
from down. The atmosphere is tense.

325
00:56:56,044 --> 00:56:58,569
I think the Army has come
to know about our mission.

326
00:56:58,746 --> 00:57:02,341
- Your life's in danger. Go at once!
- And leave my work incomplete?

327
00:57:02,617 --> 00:57:06,485
Our friends are coming tomorrow.
I can't leave.

328
00:57:06,954 --> 00:57:10,117
I'm here. I'll manage it all.
Your life...

329
00:57:10,291 --> 00:57:12,156
Don't worry about my life.

330
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:16,519
You said your wife wished
to visit her mother's place.

331
00:57:17,031 --> 00:57:21,331
- Send her tomorrow morning.
- And what about Rajjo?

332
00:57:21,836 --> 00:57:25,602
I'll take care of her.

333
00:58:04,846 --> 00:58:07,872
- It's a riot there and you sit here!
- You! I thought it was her.

334
00:58:07,915 --> 00:58:10,008
- Now scoot from here.
- Ofcourse. I'll run all the way.

335
00:58:10,752 --> 00:58:12,777
But it's your turn now.
So run!

336
00:58:13,154 --> 00:58:16,521
She's leaving town.
Lock, stock and barrel.

337
00:58:17,258 --> 00:58:21,854
I saw her luggage being loaded.
The bus will leave soon. So, run!

338
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:25,991
I'm telling the truth.
Better hurry, and go!

339
00:58:34,375 --> 00:58:38,141
I've been telling for days now.
Pack my things. But who listens?

340
00:58:38,279 --> 00:58:41,112
Careful! Keep it safely.

341
00:58:46,788 --> 00:58:49,916
- When will we start?
- As soon as we can.

342
00:58:50,057 --> 00:58:51,888
I've to go to Nurgadh.

343
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:56,790
- On the other side of the pass.
- Sure! We'll go there too.

344
00:59:03,471 --> 00:59:08,374
Hey! You won't get a seat.
The bus may go too. Come on.

345
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:13,304
If we don't get a seat, we'll have
to go standing all the way!

346
00:59:13,581 --> 00:59:18,109
- And keep on eye on things.
- Are you coming with us, or not?

347
01:00:19,247 --> 01:00:23,616
I thought you...
You can never leave me.

348
01:00:23,851 --> 01:00:27,722
Promise me, dear,
that you'll never leave me.

349
01:00:27,722 --> 01:00:31,624
What is it?
I was little late in coming.

350
01:00:31,926 --> 01:00:34,918
Aunty's gone to her mother's. I had
to see her off at the bus stand.

351
01:00:36,631 --> 01:00:41,068
And I thought you went away forever.
Never to return.

352
01:00:43,004 --> 01:00:46,496
And suppose, I do have
to go one day?

353
01:00:47,275 --> 01:00:50,301
Then I'll die.
I'll really die.

354
01:00:51,012 --> 01:00:55,039
Promise me that you will
never leave me!

355
01:00:59,253 --> 01:01:02,586
How can I ever leave
my father alone and go?

356
01:01:04,525 --> 01:01:07,517
And what of me?
Can you leave me?

357
01:01:09,597 --> 01:01:11,121
Yes, I can...

358
01:06:23,744 --> 01:06:27,305
- Hey! What's wrong, dear?
- Nothing.

359
01:06:31,652 --> 01:06:33,813
Then why the tears?

360
01:06:34,688 --> 01:06:36,883
Won't you tell me?

361
01:06:37,091 --> 01:06:41,391
If not you,
then whom do I tell?

362
01:06:42,263 --> 01:06:44,754
Whom else do I have?

363
01:06:46,066 --> 01:06:48,557
Has anybody broken your heart?

364
01:06:49,503 --> 01:06:51,494
- Naren hasn't...
- Papa...

365
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:57,768
Why would he hurt me?
I've hurt myself.

366
01:06:59,113 --> 01:07:01,809
I can't do the Juliette's role.

367
01:07:02,416 --> 01:07:03,678
Why not?

368
01:07:06,353 --> 01:07:10,084
I keep forgetting my lines.

369
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:15,055
Is that any reason to cry?

370
01:07:15,496 --> 01:07:19,432
An army officer's daughter and
look how she's crying!

371
01:07:23,070 --> 01:07:27,166
All these efforts are a waste.
I just cannot laugh today.

372
01:07:27,941 --> 01:07:29,966
Perseverance never
goes waste, dear.

373
01:07:30,544 --> 01:07:34,571
We both are persevering
and living, aren't we?

374
01:07:35,316 --> 01:07:41,016
Else, when your mother died,
leaving a 2-month old infant...

375
01:07:42,222 --> 01:07:46,090
I thought it was the end.

376
01:07:56,103 --> 01:07:59,937
Look, my dear.
I can bear to see everything.

377
01:08:00,874 --> 01:08:03,672
But not tears in your eyes.

378
01:08:07,715 --> 01:08:12,209
An army-officer...
And see how he's weeping!

379
01:08:17,191 --> 01:08:20,285
Alright.
I'll never cry again.

380
01:08:20,761 --> 01:08:24,162
It's not a must that every
girl be a Juliette.

381
01:08:33,507 --> 01:08:35,475
Some revolutionaries are
coming here tonight.

382
01:08:36,043 --> 01:08:40,412
I'll do the patrolling myself.
Make all the preparations.

383
01:09:18,886 --> 01:09:20,581
Catch him alive.

384
01:10:01,528 --> 01:10:04,793
Govind, get some water and bandages
We've to dress his wound

385
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:59,314
They killed Tyagi.

386
01:11:03,624 --> 01:11:08,459
- Shubhankar...wired us...
- Yes, go on.

387
01:11:08,996 --> 01:11:13,797
Douglas...
He's not coming on 25th.

388
01:11:15,402 --> 01:11:21,568
But 1 0 days later.

389
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:30,075
With a great difficulty...

390
01:11:32,152 --> 01:11:37,283
This pistol...Shubhankar's.

391
01:12:15,762 --> 01:12:16,990
My dear.

392
01:12:18,966 --> 01:12:23,369
Your one more
brother has gone!

393
01:12:27,407 --> 01:12:29,136
But we'll win.

394
01:12:30,978 --> 01:12:32,878
We'll definitely win!

395
01:12:35,682 --> 01:12:37,980
As long as we're together...

396
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,948
Shubhankar is not alone.

397
01:12:47,794 --> 01:12:52,094
You are with me,
aren't you?

398
01:12:53,367 --> 01:12:54,334
Tell me.

399
01:12:57,037 --> 01:12:58,937
Surround this house, men.

400
01:12:59,606 --> 01:13:02,803
Must be hiding here only.
Don't let him escape. Hurry!

401
01:13:16,923 --> 01:13:19,858
Open the door.
We've to search this house.

402
01:13:20,527 --> 01:13:24,429
-But I'm the manager of his Lordship.
- And we have a warrant to search.

403
01:13:25,699 --> 01:13:28,862
- We've chased a traitor here.
- But no traitor has come here.

404
01:13:29,469 --> 01:13:32,199
Get aside!
Come with me, men.

405
01:13:33,874 --> 01:13:37,901
You go here. And you lot, there.
The rest follow me!

406
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:45,313
Didn't I say nobody's here?
Disturb us for no rhyme or reason?

407
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:54,351
- See? Nobody's here.
- Keep quiet. Let us do our duty.

408
01:14:43,744 --> 01:14:47,737
We'll do, or die!

409
01:15:19,479 --> 01:15:23,609
- How did things change overnight?
- We can never be one!

410
01:15:25,085 --> 01:15:29,317
Forget that you ever loved
a revolutionary's daughter.

411
01:15:30,423 --> 01:15:33,187
Forget that we ever met.

412
01:15:34,327 --> 01:15:37,387
Don't try to meet me now.

413
01:15:38,198 --> 01:15:41,895
I'm going. Forever.

414
01:15:56,216 --> 01:16:02,086
Told him everything?
Didn't think of our ideals?

415
01:16:02,823 --> 01:16:04,814
You told him of our revolution?

416
01:16:05,625 --> 01:16:08,617
If he gets the police, you didn't
think what will happen to us?

417
01:16:22,976 --> 01:16:26,343
- Go from here.
- No. I've come to your father...

418
01:16:26,379 --> 01:16:29,746
For what? What do you want?
Why have you come?

419
01:16:37,457 --> 01:16:44,363
To tell you whatever she told me,
will not be revealed. Believe me.

420
01:16:44,564 --> 01:16:47,226
It's impossible
to trust those,

421
01:16:47,267 --> 01:16:50,202
...who've sold themselves
and their souls!

422
01:16:50,337 --> 01:16:53,898
I'm here before you,
and my soul's with me too!

423
01:16:54,074 --> 01:16:56,008
Yes, I can see that!

424
01:16:56,610 --> 01:16:58,544
No, you're not!

425
01:17:00,814 --> 01:17:03,476
Now I am. So tell me.

426
01:17:04,284 --> 01:17:09,356
I wanted to say that I respect
your ideals and patriotism.

427
01:17:09,356 --> 01:17:13,193
I don't want to argue, but if
you try and meet her again...

428
01:17:13,193 --> 01:17:15,821
You'll kill me? Go ahead.

429
01:17:16,463 --> 01:17:18,124
But till my end,
I'll always say...

430
01:17:18,565 --> 01:17:21,932
...that I love Rajjo and
wish to wed her!

431
01:17:22,035 --> 01:17:24,560
You fool! When the country's resoun
-ding with the cry of ''Quit India''..

432
01:17:24,604 --> 01:17:27,368
...you fret over
Love and romance?

433
01:17:28,375 --> 01:17:32,004
- Love is not a sin!
- Yes it is! It is a sin.

434
01:17:32,545 --> 01:17:36,811
A man who's not a patriot, can love
nobody on earth! It's all humbug!

435
01:17:37,017 --> 01:17:39,884
That's unfair, sir.
Your love for...

436
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,150
...your nation is great!
And our's is nothing?

437
01:17:42,689 --> 01:17:46,455
When I can understand your patriotism
try to understand my love too.

438
01:17:48,261 --> 01:17:50,354
I know I'm my father's son.

439
01:17:50,764 --> 01:17:54,200
I also know she can't come
into my world.

440
01:17:55,535 --> 01:17:59,471
But I can leave that world
and come into yours, sir.

441
01:18:00,173 --> 01:18:03,768
I'll leave that house, wealth,
money...everything, sir.

442
01:18:05,211 --> 01:18:10,615
I'll leave it all. But she's mine.
You cannot separate us.

443
01:18:14,254 --> 01:18:18,657
I'll come tomorrow morning. After
having taken my Mom's blessings.

444
01:18:19,426 --> 01:18:21,758
I'll come and seek yours.

445
01:18:48,521 --> 01:18:50,716
Why are you sitting here alone?

446
01:18:55,362 --> 01:18:58,297
You seem upset.
What is it?

447
01:19:02,802 --> 01:19:05,737
I'm leaving home, mom.

448
01:19:06,039 --> 01:19:07,131
What!

449
01:19:21,988 --> 01:19:24,513
Bring your girl here.

450
01:19:25,525 --> 01:19:29,552
Don't be afraid, son.
I'll convince your father.

451
01:19:31,197 --> 01:19:37,898
I've never asked anything of him.
But for you, I'll do so today.

452
01:19:39,506 --> 01:19:42,498
He won't be able to refuse.
Bring her here.

453
01:19:42,942 --> 01:19:46,605
She'll never agree.
I can't bring her here.

454
01:19:48,415 --> 01:19:50,349
But why not?

455
01:19:51,418 --> 01:19:53,987
She's a daughter of
a revolutionary.

456
01:19:53,987 --> 01:19:56,956
Her brother laid down
his life for the country.

457
01:19:58,124 --> 01:20:00,718
Dad will never accept her.

458
01:20:10,203 --> 01:20:12,639
I've hurt you very much,
haven't I?

459
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:15,733
No, my dear. It's I who
has hurt you all.

460
01:20:16,342 --> 01:20:19,004
It's always been ''I'',
''mine'', ''my ideals''.

461
01:20:20,513 --> 01:20:23,505
The English didn't kill my son.
I did!

462
01:20:23,917 --> 01:20:29,549
I only taught him about patriotism.
About dying for the country.

463
01:20:30,023 --> 01:20:33,460
But he became a martyr...
Did you say...

464
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:36,224
Yes.
That don't cry for martyrs.

465
01:20:37,297 --> 01:20:40,425
Your Mother.
I killed her too.

466
01:20:40,767 --> 01:20:43,031
Bearing the load of life,
and awaiting me for hours...

467
01:20:43,069 --> 01:20:45,037
...her eyes turned to stone.

468
01:20:47,373 --> 01:20:51,833
My dear, because of me,
I don't want your life...

469
01:20:52,045 --> 01:20:55,310
You have a full right
to lead your life.

470
01:20:56,182 --> 01:20:58,343
My life is with you

471
01:20:58,785 --> 01:21:02,516
Had you told me before, I'd not
have even looked at Nandu.

472
01:21:03,022 --> 01:21:05,422
Let alone love him!

473
01:21:05,825 --> 01:21:09,226
But now you do, don't you?

474
01:21:09,262 --> 01:21:11,321
Don't think me weak.

475
01:21:12,432 --> 01:21:14,696
I'm your daughter.

476
01:21:15,835 --> 01:21:18,099
- Will you forget him?
- Yes.

477
01:21:19,038 --> 01:21:22,599
Absolutely!
I'll never even give him a thought.

478
01:21:23,543 --> 01:21:26,112
If he comes, I'll say I've
nothing to do with him.

479
01:21:26,112 --> 01:21:29,047
Why should he be after me?
There are plenty of girls around.

480
01:21:29,716 --> 01:21:31,843
- I'll forget everything.
- But he loves you.

481
01:21:32,218 --> 01:21:34,516
Wants to marry you.

482
01:21:35,555 --> 01:21:38,888
But I don't wish it.
Honestly, I don't.

483
01:21:39,459 --> 01:21:43,293
Look at me and tell me that.

484
01:21:44,330 --> 01:21:49,927
He's a good boy. He's willing to
discard everything for you.

485
01:21:50,803 --> 01:21:53,966
If you refuse him,
I won't like it.

486
01:21:58,611 --> 01:22:02,377
You're very nice...
Too good!

487
01:22:12,492 --> 01:22:14,653
You're going, son? Go.

488
01:22:14,727 --> 01:22:18,322
I won't stop you. Once you marry,
all will be well.

489
01:22:18,831 --> 01:22:20,389
Take this.

490
01:22:21,501 --> 01:22:24,698
My blessings to her.

491
01:22:25,872 --> 01:22:28,773
I'll take this to her. But give
her your blessings yourself.

492
01:22:29,576 --> 01:22:33,979
I'll come in the night, with her.
Don't sleep. Await us.

493
01:22:34,314 --> 01:22:35,542
May I go now?

494
01:22:40,119 --> 01:22:43,782
I'm His Exxcellency speaking.
I wish to talk to the Major.

495
01:22:44,357 --> 01:22:46,985
- No! What are you doing?
- Get aside!

496
01:24:16,916 --> 01:24:21,819
Run, my dear! Run!
He has got the soldiers.

497
01:24:22,388 --> 01:24:23,855
No!

498
01:24:41,541 --> 01:24:43,304
Soldiers!

499
01:24:59,058 --> 01:25:01,219
Run! ...Just run!

500
01:25:24,884 --> 01:25:28,615
Give this to Shubhankar and
ask him not to give up!

501
01:25:29,222 --> 01:25:31,713
I'll follow you later.

502
01:25:32,158 --> 01:25:34,285
Don't argue!
Time's running out.
