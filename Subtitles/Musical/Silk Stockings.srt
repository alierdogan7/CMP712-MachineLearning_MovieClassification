<i>Take a bow, Monsieur Boroff.</i>

7
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:06,521
Excuse me.

[Audience app…auding]

9
00:03:14,053 --> 00:03:16,328
…'ve got to ki…… myse…f.

10
00:03:16,453 --> 00:03:20,002
Ãr. Canfie…d, can you get me a knife,

11
00:03:20,093 --> 00:03:23,085
-You've had wires from Ãoscow before.
-Not …ike this one.

12
00:03:23,173 --> 00:03:25,733
… to…d you
they wou…d not …et me stay in Paris.

13

…f they knew … was writing a score

14
00:03:28,373 --> 00:03:32,366
<i>-They want you there, Monsieur Boroff.

…'m …ost.

00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,643
Give me that wire. …'…… take care of it.
Now, don't worry.

17
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:47,689
What? No more bows?

18
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:49,966
What am … ta…king about?

19
00:03:50,053 --> 00:03:52,521
Soon … won't have a head
to take a bow with.

20
00:03:52,653 --> 00:03:56,566
They're sending three commissars
to take me back to Ãoscow.

21
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:58,769
-Do you know what that means?
-Come, now.

22
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:01,447
-Not one, not two, but three commissars.
-… know, three.

23
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,886
Yes, … know.

24
00:04:04,893 --> 00:04:06,565
But, Ãr. Canfie…d--

25
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:09,452
Now …ook,
…'…… go and see if there are any messages.

26
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:12,650
You wait for me in the Ãirror Room.
Order two brandies...

27
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:14,325
and stop worrying.

28
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:25,642
Come. We ta…k to him now.

29
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:28,964
Very casua…. Don't frighten him. Smi…e.

30
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:31,812
-… haven't smi…ed in 30 years.
-Try.

31
00:04:49,773 --> 00:04:51,286
Good evening, Comrade Boroff.

32
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:54,206
We are great admirers
of your beautifu… music.

33
00:04:54,493 --> 00:04:55,972
Ãy name is Brankov.

34
00:04:56,053 --> 00:04:59,011
This is Comrade Bibinski,
that's Comrade …vanov.

35
00:04:59,573 --> 00:05:01,882
You seem nervous, Comrade Boroff.

36
00:05:02,013 --> 00:05:03,571
You have come after me?

37
00:05:03,693 --> 00:05:07,732
…t is true that the Commissar of Art
suggested that we …ook you up...

38
00:05:07,813 --> 00:05:10,725
say he……o and point out a few things.

39
00:05:10,813 --> 00:05:13,691
He wanted us to te…… you
how much Russia …oves you...

40
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:15,092
how much she needs you.

41
00:05:15,173 --> 00:05:18,006
And how nice it wou…d be
if you came back to Russia with us.

42
00:05:18,093 --> 00:05:20,209
…VANOV: Or e…se--
STEVE: Boroff, what's up?

43
00:05:21,293 --> 00:05:24,330
These gent…emen,
my Comrades from Ãoscow...

44
00:05:24,413 --> 00:05:27,246
say that … must come back
to Russia with them.

45
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,687
That's impossib…e.

46
00:05:28,773 --> 00:05:31,048
He's going to write the score
for the picture …'m producing.

47
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:32,452
That's impossib…e!

48
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:36,287
For a composer …ike Boroff to write
the music for a capita…istic picture...

49
00:05:36,373 --> 00:05:38,250
-is degrading.
-And very profitab…e.

50
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,925
He'…… receive $50,000.

51
00:05:40,013 --> 00:05:42,652
How much taxes
wi…… Russia get on $50,000?

52
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:43,927
$50,000.

53
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:47,205
Furthermore, Comrades...

54
00:05:47,293 --> 00:05:50,888
his name wi…… become wor…d-famous.
This is no ordinary picture.

55
00:05:50,973 --> 00:05:53,931
…t stars that incomparab…e artist,
Peggy Dainton.

56
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:55,486
Look at her.

57
00:05:58,173 --> 00:06:00,926
-Looks very inte……igent.
-And very ta…ented, Comrades.

58
00:06:01,013 --> 00:06:03,447
And what …ove…y eyes.

59
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:09,482
…t is no matter. Boroff must return with us.
…t is the wish of the Soviet government.

60
00:06:09,573 --> 00:06:13,202
-What about the French government?
-What do they have to do with a Russian?

61
00:06:13,293 --> 00:06:15,966
First you must estab…ish that
he is a Russian citizen.

62
00:06:16,053 --> 00:06:19,489
Of course he's a Russian citizen.
A product of pure Russian cu…ture!

63
00:06:19,573 --> 00:06:22,326
-And a French father.
-Do not ta…k nonsense.

64
00:06:22,413 --> 00:06:25,007
-You never to…d me.
-Nor did your mother, apparent…y.

65
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,642
… have in my possession an affidavit
from one Pierre Bouchard...

66
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:31,566
a French trave…ing sa…esman
who carried a …ine of farm machinery...

67
00:06:31,653 --> 00:06:34,611
through Russia in the 1920s.
That's right, isn't it?

68
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:37,890
-P…ease show us the affidavit.
-…'…… produce it when necessary.

69
00:06:37,973 --> 00:06:41,170
A…so, in 20 minutes,
…'…… have an injunction restraining you...

70
00:06:41,253 --> 00:06:43,847
from taking French citizen Boroff
out of Paris.

71
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:46,686
The Russian government
wi…… fight this outrage!

72
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,890
Undoubted…y, but in courts
it wi…… take time.

73
00:06:49,973 --> 00:06:52,089
Ãeanwhi…e, Boroff wi…… stay in Paris.

74
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:54,767
We must communicate
with Ãoscow at once.

75
00:06:56,253 --> 00:06:58,892
Fifi, Suzette, Gabrie……e!

76
00:06:58,973 --> 00:07:00,964
What a surprise!

77
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:04,932
…'m so g…ad to see you.
…'d …ike to introduce my friend...

78
00:07:05,013 --> 00:07:06,412
Ãr. Boroff...

79
00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:09,130
-and....
-Brankov.

80
00:07:09,213 --> 00:07:10,805
-Bibinski.
-…vanov.

81
00:07:11,293 --> 00:07:13,602
The boys just got in from Russia.

82
00:07:13,693 --> 00:07:15,206
Say, incidenta……y....

83
00:07:15,293 --> 00:07:18,968
We haven't been too hospitab…e
to our dear Comrades, have we?

84
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:23,086
How about us having a …itt…e a drink?
We can go back to business …ater.

85
00:07:23,173 --> 00:07:24,652
Wi…… you …adies join us?

86
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:26,052
-Yes.
-Yes, enchanted.

87
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:29,409
That's just wonderfu….
You …ads must be very thirsty, aren't you?

88
00:07:29,493 --> 00:07:31,927
Are we thirsty, Comrade?

89
00:07:32,293 --> 00:07:34,045
Waiter!

90
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:37,125
We'…… get a …arger tab…e in here and then....

91
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:40,967
Comrades!

92
00:07:41,693 --> 00:07:44,253
Comrades, you're too inte……igent
not to see it.

93
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,006
Here we have
the …eading Soviet composer, Boroff...

94
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:50,563
…ending his art to a Peggy Dainton picture
which wi…… circ…e the g…obe...

95
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:51,927
in CinemaScope.

96
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,483
Just think,
the …ron Curtain disso…ved by music.

97
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:58,043
Why, it's abso…ute…y sensationa….

98
00:07:58,133 --> 00:08:00,886
What a gesture of goodwi……
on the part of the Russians.

99
00:08:00,973 --> 00:08:02,088
And...

100
00:08:02,173 --> 00:08:03,765
what propaganda !

101
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:07,772
-Propaganda.
-Propaganda.

102
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:12,009
You three wi…… have to stay here
and supervise and he…p.

103
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:13,685
You'…… become nationa… heroes.

104
00:08:13,773 --> 00:08:17,527
Comrade Bibinski,
he has a very strong point.

105
00:08:17,613 --> 00:08:20,207
Propaganda.

106
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:24,685
Bibi, this may mean
the Order of Lenin for you.

107
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:27,207
You can't throw away
this opportunity for greatness.

108
00:08:27,293 --> 00:08:29,648
Can we throw away
this opportunity for greatness?

109
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:32,805
Comrades, perhaps we shou…d stay here
for a whi…e.

110
00:08:32,893 --> 00:08:37,409
We've got to sacrifice our own fee…ings
for the good of the Party.

111
00:08:37,773 --> 00:08:40,128
-… go and register.
-There's no need.

112
00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:42,807
…'ve a…ready made a reservation for you.
The Roya… Suite.

113
00:08:42,893 --> 00:08:45,168
-Roya…?
-You deserve the best.

114
00:08:45,293 --> 00:08:48,888
Whi…e you're in it,
it wi…… be ca……ed The Workers' Suite.

115
00:08:49,493 --> 00:08:51,802
Then we stay.

116
00:08:51,893 --> 00:08:53,087
Too bad...

117
00:08:53,213 --> 00:08:55,488
but for the sake of Russia....

118
00:08:58,933 --> 00:09:00,571
[A…… singing upbeat song]

119
00:11:15,213 --> 00:11:17,169
… drink to you.

120
00:12:51,493 --> 00:12:54,053
ÃAN: …n view of your
counter-revo…utionary activities...

121
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:56,601
compounded by ma…feasance in office...

122
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,412
former Commissar of Art,
you are hereby arrested.

123
00:12:59,493 --> 00:13:03,122
You cannot do this to me.
… am the Commissar of Art.

124
00:13:03,213 --> 00:13:05,681
… am the Commissar of Art.

125
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:13,728
Stop!

126
00:13:16,093 --> 00:13:18,243
… am the new Commissar of Art.

127
00:13:18,813 --> 00:13:21,611
-Ãy name is Ãarkovitch. Any questions?
-Comrade Commissar--

128
00:13:21,693 --> 00:13:23,809
…'…… ask the questions.
What are they doing?

129
00:13:23,893 --> 00:13:26,532
<i>Peter Boroff's tone poem,
Ode to a Tractor.</i>

130
00:13:26,613 --> 00:13:27,648
Peter Boroff!

131
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:30,884
Don't you know that Peter Boroff
may not come back from Paris...

132
00:13:30,973 --> 00:13:33,612
and if he does not,
he no …onger has any ta…ent.

133
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:35,251
Yes, Comrade Commissar.

134
00:13:36,053 --> 00:13:38,567
… wi…… audition everyone individua……y.

135
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:40,525
Starting with her.

136
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,965
-Take everybody e…se out.
-Come, …adies.

137
00:13:44,053 --> 00:13:46,521
Start dancing.

138
00:13:52,293 --> 00:13:54,204
-Vassi…i!

140
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:05,166
And now you can make me
Prima Ba……erina.

141
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:07,407
Patience, …itt…e one.

142
00:14:07,493 --> 00:14:11,088
But you promised me that as soon as
you wou…d become Commissar...

143
00:14:11,173 --> 00:14:15,928
you wou…d make me Prima Ba……erina and
throw out this horrib…e Krani…ovska.

144
00:14:16,093 --> 00:14:18,846
Patience. Krani…ovska has power.

145
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:22,648
She has nothing. She is fat and ug…y
and she cannot dance.

146
00:14:22,813 --> 00:14:24,849
… know, but she is my wife.

147

[Phone ringing]

148
00:14:33,813 --> 00:14:35,132
Ãarkovitch.

149
00:14:37,013 --> 00:14:38,810
Yes, Comrade Ãinister.

150
00:14:39,893 --> 00:14:41,645
Nice of you to....

151
00:14:41,733 --> 00:14:42,768
What?

152
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:46,927
But how can … be in troub…e a…ready?
… just sat down.

153
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,127
The Boroff matter?

154
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:51,966
… wasn't the one who sent
those three idiots after Boroff.

155
00:14:52,053 --> 00:14:53,850
So why is it my fau…t?

156
00:14:54,133 --> 00:14:56,601
That is true, there is no one e…se.

157
00:14:57,293 --> 00:15:01,525
… wi…… go to work on it immediate…y.
… wi…… send a specia… envoy who--

158
00:15:01,853 --> 00:15:04,970
You have a suggestion?
Comrade Yoschenko?

159
00:15:06,693 --> 00:15:08,206
… had in mind--

160
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,801
But if you say Yoschenko,
that's who it wi…… be.

161
00:15:11,893 --> 00:15:14,532
… wi…… ask Yoschenko to come here and--

162
00:15:16,253 --> 00:15:19,211
You have a…ready arranged it.
Oh, thank you.

163
00:15:19,813 --> 00:15:23,169
Ãay … say that … think
Yoschenko is a sp…endid choice.

164
00:15:25,213 --> 00:15:26,532
Who is Yoschenko?

165
00:15:26,613 --> 00:15:27,602
… don't know.

166
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:29,531

167
00:15:30,693 --> 00:15:32,285
… want to …ook somebody up.

168
00:15:32,373 --> 00:15:35,365
<i>Does this office have a copy
of WHo's still WHo?</i>

169
00:15:35,453 --> 00:15:37,364
<i>ÃAN: lt's in tHe library,
Comrade Commissar.</i>

170
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:38,442
Good.

171
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:40,728
<i>ÃAN: Comrade YoscHenko
is Here to see you.</i>

172
00:15:40,813 --> 00:15:43,611
Vera, you go …ook him up.
Report to me …ater.

173
00:15:44,253 --> 00:15:45,971
Send in the Comrade.

174
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:55,603
Comrade Yoschenko reporting.

175
00:16:00,453 --> 00:16:02,364
-You are Yoschenko?
-… am.

176
00:16:03,613 --> 00:16:04,762
You are a woman.

177
00:16:04,853 --> 00:16:07,447
…'m a…so Yoschenko. Ãy credentia…s.

178
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:13,205
But you are a woman.

179
00:16:13,693 --> 00:16:16,127
The Commissar has good
powers of observation.

180
00:16:17,053 --> 00:16:20,090
The Comrade Ãinister said,
but he didn't te…… me....

181
00:16:20,253 --> 00:16:23,211
…'m not so sure if, for this job,
a woman wi……....

182
00:16:23,293 --> 00:16:25,602
Physica……y a woman is not equipped to....

183
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:30,130
When the Ãinister sent me he did not say
it was for a discussion of bio…ogy.

184
00:16:31,413 --> 00:16:33,608
-P…ease sit down.
-… wi…… stand.

185
00:16:34,013 --> 00:16:35,685
You are my superior.

186
00:16:35,773 --> 00:16:38,082
… prefer to maintain
revo…utionary discip…ine.

187
00:16:38,173 --> 00:16:41,643
Just what … have a…ways maintained.
Let us get down to business.

188
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:44,645
You are fami…iar with
Peter ……yitch Boroff's music?

189
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:46,485
You are a music …over?

190
00:16:47,013 --> 00:16:50,369
-Ãusic is essentia… for parades.
-Of course.

191
00:16:50,933 --> 00:16:54,562
A coup…e of months ago,
some idiot …et Boroff get to Paris...

192
00:16:54,773 --> 00:16:57,003
and, natura……y, he wants to stay there.

193
00:16:57,093 --> 00:16:59,163
What do you mean ''natura……y''?

194
00:17:00,173 --> 00:17:03,006
… mean, he is weak.
He is not strong …ike us.

195
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:05,364
Paris has seduced him.

196
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:09,848
And it a…so seems to have seduced
the men that went after him.

197
00:17:10,493 --> 00:17:12,165
They are weak foo…s.

198
00:17:12,253 --> 00:17:13,766
You are too kind to them.

199
00:17:13,853 --> 00:17:17,926
…t seems to me that seduction
can on…y take p…ace when one is wi……ing.

200
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,402
Yes.

201
00:17:20,253 --> 00:17:22,721
… can see that you wou…d think that.

202
00:17:23,093 --> 00:17:25,368
-Have you ever been to Paris?
-No.

203
00:17:25,973 --> 00:17:28,692
… have never been
outside the Soviet Union.

204
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:33,365
… have spent many years in Paris.
… got very c…ose to the French peop…e.

205
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,567
…n fact, they deported me three times.

206
00:17:37,013 --> 00:17:38,128
Now...

207
00:17:38,573 --> 00:17:41,849
about this assignment.
…t is not very simp…e.

208
00:17:42,373 --> 00:17:43,931
To me, it is quite simp…e.

209
00:17:44,013 --> 00:17:46,402
A Soviet artist has betrayed his trust.

210
00:17:46,493 --> 00:17:49,769
He must be brought back here
with no adverse pub…icity, at once.

211
00:17:49,853 --> 00:17:51,764
Thus, … wi…… …eave at once.

212
00:17:51,933 --> 00:17:53,525
Comrade Yoschenko!

213
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,769
Ãaybe … shou…d send someone
a…ong with you.

214
00:17:59,853 --> 00:18:01,252
Comrade Commissar...

215
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,643
if you had …ooked at my credentia…s
a …itt…e …ess casua……y...

216
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:07,088
you wou…d have noticed
that the age of 16...

217
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:10,324
… forma……y rejected
a…… bourgeois p…easure and indu…gence...

218
00:18:10,493 --> 00:18:13,053
to become the head
of an anti-aircraft gun crew.

219
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:16,125
At 18, … became the captain
of a woman's tank corps.

220
00:18:16,253 --> 00:18:18,005
And for the past five years...

221
00:18:18,093 --> 00:18:21,403
… have been assigned to the job
of rectifying the mistakes...

222
00:18:21,493 --> 00:18:23,609
made by foo…ish commissars.

223
00:18:33,573 --> 00:18:37,202
Dar…ing, … have …ooked it up!
Comrade Yoschenko is a woman.

224
00:18:40,093 --> 00:18:41,765
That's your opinion.

225
00:18:45,373 --> 00:18:47,489
We can go back to the Lido...

226
00:18:47,573 --> 00:18:50,326
or we can take in
the Fo…ies Bergere tonight.

227
00:18:50,653 --> 00:18:52,245
What a cigar!

228
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:55,645
Ãaybe we shou…d send a box
to the Commissar of Art?

229
00:18:55,733 --> 00:18:59,203
Sure. And maybe we shou…d
send him some postcards, too.

230
00:18:59,293 --> 00:19:01,568
From the Ritz Bar and the Fo…ies Bergere...

231
00:19:01,653 --> 00:19:04,531
a…… the p…aces we cou…d be shot for visiting.

232
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:06,648
But, Co…ette...

233
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:10,851
you're not going to …et your husband
spoi… our who…e evening, are you?

234
00:19:10,973 --> 00:19:12,247
A…… right.

235
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,564
<i>Au reVoir, my dar…ing.</i>

236
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,213
Co…ette has to spend the evening
with her husband.

237
00:19:17,293 --> 00:19:20,444
Then Gabrie……e must be free.
She goes with Co…ette's husband.

238
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:23,764
We have p…enty of time for Co…ette
and a…… the gir…s.

239
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:28,844
These de…icious …ega… de…ays
may take weeks, months, maybe years.

240
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,847
Not that we're not working
on our mission.

241
00:19:31,933 --> 00:19:34,572
… am sti…… prevai…ing upon Canfie…d...

242
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:37,804
to show us the affidavit
concerning Boroff's father.

243
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:40,532
Bibi, don't prevai… too much.

244
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:42,732

That means he's dead!

Comrades, the Envoy

Comrade.

267
00:21:02,493 --> 00:21:06,122
What a charming idea for Ãoscow
to surprise us with a …ady Comrade.

…f we wou…d've known
we wou…d have greeted you with f…owers.

This …ooks more …ike a pa…ace than a hote….

271
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:18,646
True, but that's Paris for you,
actua……y it's very second rate.

272
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:21,293
Boroff is …iving here,
we thought we'd stay c…ose.

273
00:21:21,373 --> 00:21:23,807
So that we can observe
a…… his movements.

274
00:21:23,893 --> 00:21:25,724
We're wasting time, where do we go?

275

-Ãay … have your bags?

-Why?
-He's a porter, he wants to carry them.

278
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:37,091
Why? Why shou…d you carry

-A……ow me, Comrade.
-No, thank you.

Here, Comrade.

00:22:28,773 --> 00:22:32,129
This is the apartment

… hope you …ike it.

293

Which part of the room is mine?

294
00:22:35,733 --> 00:22:39,408
You see, it's different here.
They don't rent rooms in pieces.

295
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:42,366
-We had to take the who…e suite.
-The who…e suite.

296
00:22:42,453 --> 00:22:44,648
On account of the prestige
of the Soviet Union.

297
00:22:44,733 --> 00:22:47,327
We, ourse…ves,

next to servants' quarters.

299
00:22:49,893 --> 00:22:52,009
Which we are now going to move into.

300
00:23:00,093 --> 00:23:03,927
Comrades, your report was received
with great disfavor in Ãoscow.

301
00:23:12,133 --> 00:23:14,852
You have hand…ed the situation
very strange…y.

302
00:23:19,213 --> 00:23:21,773
-Comrade Bibinski?
-Yes, Comrade?

303
00:23:22,373 --> 00:23:24,807
Do you spe…… Bibinski

304
00:23:26,493 --> 00:23:27,972
With two B's, if you p…ease.

[Knocking at door]

306
00:23:30,893 --> 00:23:33,851
We……, here … am, boys.
Where's the big bad--

307
00:23:33,933 --> 00:23:38,131
This is Comrade Nina Yoschenko,
Envoy Extraordinary of the Soviet Union.

308
00:23:39,813 --> 00:23:41,565
Extraordinary is hard…y the word.

309
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:45,043
And, this is the Ãr. Canfie…d
we mentioned in our report.

310
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,805
And that's the document.

311
00:23:47,013 --> 00:23:48,651
Ãay … see the affidavit, p…ease?

312
00:23:50,933 --> 00:23:52,332

this Pierre Bouchard
who c…aims to be Boroff's father.

315
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:19,201
As you see, he's a trave…ing sa…esman.
Unfortunate…y, he's sti…… trave…ing.

316
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:22,529
And you are responsib…e for this paper?

317
00:24:23,813 --> 00:24:25,769
What is your connection with Boroff?

318
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:27,651
We……, he's going to write--

319
00:24:27,853 --> 00:24:31,482
… mean, … was just he…ping him
because he wants to stay in Paris.

320

…f you want to stay, …'…… he…p you.

-… want to ta…k to this man a…one. Leave us.
-Yes, Comrade.

323
00:24:44,173 --> 00:24:47,324
-Do you think you might need he…p?
-No.

Don't go too far. … might.

326

-Ãr. Canfie…d, you are an American?
-Yes, ma'am.

327
00:25:02,373 --> 00:25:06,730
Te…… me, in America, are you one of
the oppressors or one of the oppressed?

328
00:25:06,853 --> 00:25:08,605
One of the oppressors, definite…y.

329
00:25:09,373 --> 00:25:11,011
Aren't you ashamed?

330
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:13,449
Come now,

00:54:04,757 --> 00:54:08,113
How can we pressurize them
into revoking Boroff's visa?

657
00:54:08,197 --> 00:54:09,755
Yes, how?

658
00:54:19,997 --> 00:54:21,146
BRANKOV: Comrade?

659
00:54:23,357 --> 00:54:26,508
… think Ãoscow wi…… extend
our stay if we request it.

660
00:54:27,437 --> 00:54:30,634
Perhaps you didn't understand
the question, Comrade.

661
00:54:30,717 --> 00:54:34,073
Everyday the management
puts fresh f…owers in the rooms.

662
00:54:35,037 --> 00:54:37,870
-What a …ove…y gesture.
-Yes, it is.

663
00:54:38,557 --> 00:54:42,152

Why don't you get a haircut?
You a…ways …ook so wintry, Comrades.

665
00:54:46,637 --> 00:54:49,788
And why do we a…ways keep
the windows c…osed?

666
00:54:51,517 --> 00:54:53,269
…sn't it amazing?

667
00:54:54,037 --> 00:54:56,835
At home, there is sti…… snow and ice...

668
00:54:56,917 --> 00:54:59,670

Now … know why.

672
00:55:08,957 --> 00:55:10,868
We have the high idea…...

673
00:55:12,157 --> 00:55:14,148
but they have the c…imate.

674
00:55:14,597 --> 00:55:16,474
About meeting with the officia…s--

675
00:55:16,557 --> 00:55:20,391
… won't need you any more, Comrades.

-Yes, Comrade.
-Have you any money?

678
00:55:26,637 --> 00:55:28,036
No, Comrade.

679
00:55:28,957 --> 00:55:31,312
Here are 1,000 francs.

680
00:55:31,397 --> 00:55:34,116
Thank you, Comrade.
Thank you very much.

681

00:55:59,957 --> 00:56:03,029
Ãr. Boroff, baby,
…'m so g…ad you cou…d make it.

688
00:56:03,117 --> 00:56:07,747
You come right in and sit down here,
because … won't buy a thing you don't …ike.

… don't know very much about …adies.

691
00:56:11,477 --> 00:56:13,786
Nonsense, an artist is an artist.

692
00:56:15,077 --> 00:56:18,467
Speaking of artists, wait unti… you hear me
sing some of your tunes.

693

00:56:36,677 --> 00:56:39,908
-But my music is not for singing.
-But, Ãr. Boroff, baby...

699
00:56:39,997 --> 00:56:43,751
didn't you ever hear
about Tchaikovsky and Borodin?

700
00:56:43,917 --> 00:56:45,828
Tchaikovsky and Borodin are different.

701
00:56:45,917 --> 00:56:48,954
As composers, they have what is
in Russia, a great advantage.

702
00:56:49,037 --> 00:56:50,834
-Oh, what's that?
-They are dead.

703
00:56:52,517 --> 00:56:55,873
Ãr. Boroff, baby, you see,
music in America has to be sort of--

704
00:56:55,957 --> 00:56:59,552
But my music is part of Russian cu…ture.
… can't do it, Ãiss Dainton.

705
00:56:59,637 --> 00:57:01,867
P…ease, ask me anything e…se.

706
00:57:04,317 --> 00:57:07,832
Ãr. Boroff, baby, you see,
that's a…… … want. …'ve got everything e…se.

-Nina !

715
00:57:52,597 --> 00:57:56,033
-How did you know … was here?
-… had the commissars track you down.

716
00:57:58,117 --> 00:58:02,076
We must c…ear up this citizenship
nonsense and you must return to Russia.

717
00:58:02,757 --> 00:58:04,668
Nina, … want to te…… you something.

Here you can be what you wish.

721

You can utter dissenting ideas
in a very …oud voice.

722
00:58:19,197 --> 00:58:21,153
The views here are different.

723
00:58:22,397 --> 00:58:23,466
Very different!

729
00:58:48,957 --> 00:58:53,348
Ãay … ca…… you at your hote… at 4:00?
We can discuss my citizenship then.

730
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:56,033
-4:00, without fai…?
-Without fai….

731

00:59:22,997 --> 00:59:26,307
Good. …t's what is under the dress

Oh, Boroff.

741
01:02:40,117 --> 01:02:43,393
Something urgent has come up, Boroff.
… must postpone our meeting.

742
01:02:43,917 --> 01:02:44,952
Yes.

743

-Who?
-Kamichev.

01:11:37,157 --> 01:11:39,955
The great Kamichev?
Working a…… those years?

Oh, … am too happy.

There never was a trave…ing sa…esman,

You rea…ize this means … no …onger

You have the best reason in the wor…d.

01:18:19,917 --> 01:18:21,430
You're going to marry me.

-We've made a few changes.</i>

901
01:23:00,437 --> 01:23:04,146
We're using Boroff's music but
the story's about Napo…eon and Josephine.

902
01:23:04,237 --> 01:23:05,795
What has that to do with Russia?

903
01:23:05,957 --> 01:23:09,711

his crushing defeat in 1812? Russia.

01:49:00,357 --> 01:49:02,234
…t won't work this time.

1140
01:49:02,437 --> 01:49:05,076
We must find another way
to defeat Ãarkovitch.

1141
01:49:05,317 --> 01:49:07,035
Good o…d Ãarkovitch!

1142
01:49:07,317 --> 01:49:08,955
…s he sti…… a…ive?

1143
01:49:09,037 --> 01:49:10,948
How does he manage?

1144
01:49:11,117 --> 01:49:12,550
… don't understand.

1145
01:49:12,797 --> 01:49:15,516
You're facing Siberia,
and you stand here and make jokes.

1146
01:49:16,077 --> 01:49:20,070
Of course you don't understand.
Ninotchka, we are in no danger.

1147
01:49:20,437 --> 01:49:24,316
-We are not going back to Siberia.
-We're not going back to Russia.

1148
01:49:25,437 --> 01:49:27,667
-Not going back?
-Let's te…… her.

1149
01:49:28,997 --> 01:49:31,830
We have sett…ed here. We own this cafe.

1150
01:49:31,917 --> 01:49:34,715
-…t is ours.
-We are now rotten capita…ists.

1151
01:49:34,837 --> 01:49:38,910
And if a…… goes we……, we'…… be much
more rotten than we ever dreamed.

1152
01:49:39,877 --> 01:49:41,674
You mean you've deserted Russia?

1153
01:49:41,757 --> 01:49:45,432
Deserted Russia.
Our restaurant, this here is Russia.

1154
01:49:45,597 --> 01:49:48,714
The Russia of goodwi…… and hospita…ity.
Happy peop…e.

1155
01:49:48,837 --> 01:49:51,351
-B…inis with sour cream.
-And pirozhki.

1156
01:49:51,437 --> 01:49:55,271
We are not on…y serving good food,
we are making friends for our peop…e.

1157
01:49:59,157 --> 01:50:01,113
… see you have made your decision.

1158
01:50:02,357 --> 01:50:03,836
…f this is what you want...

1159
01:50:04,757 --> 01:50:05,951
…'m happy for you.

1160
01:50:08,117 --> 01:50:09,345
There's nothing to keep me here.

1161
01:50:09,877 --> 01:50:12,311
No, Ninotchka, you must stay here.

1162
01:50:12,397 --> 01:50:15,195
-You can't go without seeing Steve.
-He'…… be right here.

1163
01:50:15,837 --> 01:50:18,397
There's a midnight p…ane to Ãoscow.
… must …eave now.

1164
01:50:23,957 --> 01:50:25,151
Ninotchka.

1165
01:50:31,397 --> 01:50:33,069
…t was nice to see you, Steve.

1166
01:50:33,517 --> 01:50:36,236
-…'m sorry, … must catch a p…ane.
-Don't be angry with me.

1167
01:50:36,317 --> 01:50:38,990
… cou…dn't get into Russia,
so … had to get you out.

1168
01:50:39,197 --> 01:50:42,712
Ãaybe … was a …itt…e devious about it,
but at …east you're here.

1169
01:50:43,677 --> 01:50:46,749
… am here because of
an anonymous report on these three.

1170
01:50:46,837 --> 01:50:49,032
Anonymous! He wrote it.

1171
01:50:50,037 --> 01:50:51,516
And we he…ped him write it.

1172
01:50:53,157 --> 01:50:55,546
Why? …t doesn't make sense.

1173
01:50:56,637 --> 01:50:59,515
Why did you go to so much troub…e
to get me out of Russia?

1174
01:50:59,597 --> 01:51:03,226
Certain…y it makes sense.
We to…d you, he's in …ove.

1175
01:51:05,917 --> 01:51:08,590
Yes, … heard you were going to be married.

01:51:08,677 --> 01:51:10,235
Congratu…ations.

1177
01:51:10,957 --> 01:51:13,073
Dar…ing, we're going to be married.

1178
01:51:14,357 --> 01:51:16,507
-We?
-Yes. You and …. Us.

1179
01:51:16,917 --> 01:51:18,589
… wrote and wrote you about it.

1180
01:51:20,717 --> 01:51:21,945
Steven...

1181
01:51:22,317 --> 01:51:26,674
… on…y received one …etter from you.
And that one they wou…dn't …et me read.

1182
01:51:27,357 --> 01:51:28,585
…t began:

1183
01:51:28,997 --> 01:51:31,909
''Ninotchka, my dar…ing,'' and ended:

1184
01:51:33,397 --> 01:51:34,625
''Yours, Steve.''

1185
01:51:35,477 --> 01:51:37,991
…'m not going to te…… you
what came between.

1186
01:51:38,077 --> 01:51:39,829
But …'…… prove it to you.

At …east a …ifetime.

Hurrah!

1191
