Hurry!

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
- Here is Hurry.

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000

"Since my childhood I was an obedient,
Child scrofulous,

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I did not like leprosy,
But he adored orders.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Since then, for me the word chef -
law

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Next, no arguments!

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I have only one deeply convinced
Do not have an opinion!

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
In the battle of personal clothing
Do not be thinking Hurry,

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Boss in favor
I'll go through fire and water.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Always for me the word chef -
law

00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Next, no arguments!

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I have only one deeply convinced
Do not have an opinion!

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Sometimes, I'm rebelling
And the chief criticism,

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm trying to argue with him,
But then I wake up.

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
No, no, for me, the word chef -
law

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Forward! No arguments!

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I have only one deeply convinced
Do not have an opinion! "

Professor Gromov.

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Arrived. Proceed to
work.

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Wonderful.
Give a few more parties.

45
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
- I'm tired of chess.
- Well, let's talk seriously.

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Do not want to seriously.
Why should I always serious?

47
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Elik, where are you?

48
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Elik?

49
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
- Elik, you hear me?
- Of course, I hear.

50
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Elik, you behave badly.

51
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
- To fulfill my desire.
- Elik stop.

52
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
- Swap. I order.
- You see?

53
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And I do not want you to me
ordered.

54
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yes.

55
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Elik electronics, I ask
Finally.

56
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I also ask.

57
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Well, that's win,
win, then ask.

58
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You mate, Professor Gromov.

59
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
How?

60
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That's incredible.

61
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And if so?

62
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It is absolutely accurate.

63
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So it's wonderful.
It's amazing.

64
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
- Here we succeeded.
- So, a victory?

65
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
- Holiday?
- And what a.

66
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Congratulations, Elik.

67
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And now you have
fulfill their promise.

68
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
- Well, what do you want?
- Be as you are.

69
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I do not understand, put it more precisely.

70
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Always act in their own way.

71
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And do what I please.
In general, be a man.

72
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You know, baby, be a man -
is not quite what you think.

73
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
- You created for other purposes.
- To play chess?

74
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
- To win!
- No. I do not want.

75
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I want to be like everyone else.

76
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
As a boy on TV.

77
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
- Who are you? Mosenergo?
- Superkarding.

78
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Sorry.

79
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
- Be quiet, Masha, quieter.
- Viktor Ivanovich.

80
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Rather, Masha, at the institute.

81
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What happened?

82
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I barely managed to calm him down.
But the results are startling.

83
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Forgive,
I picked you up so early.

84
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Why? I - your assistant.

85
00:07:40,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And the only person
who knows about electronics.

86
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You should not have made him a boy.

87
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And you know, wanted me
communicated with some drawer?

88
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
No, I'm not talking about appearance.
But you have so much invested in him,

89
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
that he, excuse me, just
spoiled.

90
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:32,000
However, the boy failed to
glory.

91
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Volobuev? Where Volobuev?
Volobuev!

92
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Electronics - a brilliant invention.
But what will you do with it?

93
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
- I can not imagine.
- Do not you think that he can...

94
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
No. I do not think so.
I am very attached to him.

95
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Odd word, I feel sad because
that he will never become a man.

96
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
- Are you sure you do not get?
- Electronics! This is his legs.

97
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
- Where did he come from?
- From the camel.

98
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Can not be. I have a right
confiscated. Viktor Ivanovich!

99
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Electronics, you act
wrong.

100
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I never expected from you such
illogical behavior.

101
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And you, okay? Who promised
fulfill my wish?

102
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Understand, you're asking the impossible.

103
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I want to become a man, what
is impossible?

104
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Sit, Victor Ivanovich
Sit. I can not drive a car.

105
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Electronics, now we
let's talk seriously.

106
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
- Elik, you must understand!
- I understand you do not want to help me.

107
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
- And you too?
- Come on down, nasty boy!

108
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Elik what are you going?

109
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Goodbye, I'll come back when
become a real person.

110
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:04,000
- Back after him! Hurry!
- I'm not a racer. I - scientist!

111
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Electronic!

112
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
- Well, lad.
- What guy? What a guy?

113
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
- Listen, you're doing what?
- Electronics - a boy

114
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
just as real, but doeth
God knows what!

115
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Think, boy.

116
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Do not grab it right away, not enough
it immediately.

117
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Find out first, as he
managed.

118
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Find out how he managed
first.

119
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:06,000
- I do not understand, repeat.
- Find out where his button!

120
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Where is the button where the button and find
would be where he is.

121
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
- Boy, who are you?
- Electronics.

122
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
- Who?
- Electronics.

123
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
- Victor! That's yours.
- Come on, come here. Hold.

124
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You instead Volobuyeva? Sit
rather, starting.

125
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
No buts. Rescue team
necessary, we human beings can not.

126
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
- Man?
- Well, of course.

127
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Come on, hurry, hurry, hurry.
Go!

128
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
- Where is he?
- Do not know.

129
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yes.

130
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Stop, stop.

131
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:31,000
- We'll have to wait.
- Well, well, well.

132
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
- We lost Electronics.
- Nothing, Viktor Ivanovich.

133
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Wherever Elik not proved, he
necessarily betray himself.

134
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
- Yes. Unfortunately, you're right.
- Sorry?

135
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Understand, this is not the usual
boy

136
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
which is burst into tears of failure.
If he does not understand, he is satisfied

137
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
that failed...

138
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Well, what then?

139
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Electronics can die.
That is why it is urgently necessary to find.

140
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Let us turn to the police?

141
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
From left Professor robot.
Can you imagine what will happen?

142
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Why, in fact, a robot, but
Viktor Ivanovich?

143
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Elik Gromov - your nephew.

144
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
A? Do you have his photo?

145
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
- Yes, here.
- Well?

146
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Oh, that Elik in the magazine?

147
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
No, he can not smile
for photo I made appearance.

148
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:47,000
- And the boy?
- I do not even know his name.

149
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:58,000
- Sergei! So that was home for supper!
- Yes I will!

150
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:08,000

151
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Hello, Syroezhkin.

155
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Syropopkin.

156
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
- Oh you just Gus.
- What?

157
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Stop!

158
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:52,000

- Go away.
- And yet, it seems hard for you.

163
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'll support you.

164
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:45,000
What are you doing? Why?

165
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
- How do I know where he disappeared.
- There he is dressed.

166

- Oh, what is their so much?
- Here! He wrapped up!

169
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Where? Why?

170
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

171
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
- Hiding, then?
- And you?

172
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000

328
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Okay, go out, give

Syroezhkin.

- And this will be a man?
- What do you think?

335
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Girls must be protected?
Well, come on, come on, well.

336
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Stop, I want you to
leave the girl alone

337
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
and left the place.

338
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
- And the more you do not want?
- I have one wish.

339
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,000
- But to you it is not relevant.
- What? And in the ear is not it?

340
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
- No, spank.

341
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Why?

342
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Shoo! There's more!

343
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Come on, come here!

344
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
- Are you cool you do it.

345
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Yes. Thank you.

346
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
What's the name of my savior?

347
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:20,000
- Come here. Go.
- Excuse me. One second.

348
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Hush, Martic, well, quieter.

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Oh, sorry, ran away.

He's here. I can take.

353
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
A button found?

354
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000

- Never.

357
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Peace and goodwill,
otherwise he would not compromise.

358
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I wish you good health.

359
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
- Are you in a school study?
- In the 42nd.

360
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Hello, I'm in the forty-fourth,
close.

361
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And in what class?

362
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
So, Maria, for me, I see it.

363
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000

- My name is Maya Svetlova.

364
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Yes.

365
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Go!

366
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Just tell me about you, but then somehow
funny.

367
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:58,000
- Where is he? A? Where?
- Oh, here he is! Hurry!

368
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Two.

369
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:15,000
- What happened Hurry?
- Nothing, nothing.

370
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Oh, sorry.

371
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
- Viktor Ivanovich.
- What?

372
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Oh, all I do not take it anymore.

373
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Oh, Momma.

374
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
- And you did not see the second?
- Do not have time.

375
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Pity. That policeman said
that they are very similar.

376
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
- It seemed to him.
- No, I do not think.

377
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
- And what if they met?
- Elik and the guy with the photos?

378
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Professor, it's not logical, it is
contrary to any theory.

379
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Elik himself against any
theory.

380
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
You'll see, we now
be such a surprise!

381
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
- Citizens, can you read?
- Yes. Why?

382
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
- Here, Masha, listen...
- Professor, you're an idealist.

383
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:22,000
If you are sober and realistic
look at these things...

384
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
- Well, you see me today and shook.
- Tired?

385
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Yes, okay.

386
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Sergey, what's wrong?

387
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,000
His head does not stay, but still
problems in algebra.

388
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:51,000
- Give your problem.
- Yes?

389
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
84, 85.

390
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
- The first response -40, -4 second.
- It's that. I need a solution.

391
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,000
- In the notebook. My handwriting.
- Good. I will copy each letter.

392
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Yes? Really? Well, come on, do it.
Only when you do, wake up,

393
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:24,000
and then I have to go home.

394
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Well, what about you?

395
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Go on.

396
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And you?

397
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Hey, listen, tell me where
train?

398
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
- Well, what you see?
- In general, yes. I did not expect.

399
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Now you'll know. Understand?

400
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Well, tell me where?

401
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
The system of yoga. With five years.

402
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
- You mean that? A?
- "Wait a minute.

403
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
- What you before?
- It was impossible.

404
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Anger accumulated.

405
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Here.

406
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
So, so, so, well, well.

407
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Wait a minute.

413
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Well, bolder, S., boldly.

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Integral, integral.

417
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Integral!

418
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Intregal.

419
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Intregal.

420

S., well, how can you?
What intregal?

421
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Hello, Sergei. I'm sorry,
but I have not had time to finish everything here.

422
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Why are you?

423
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
You do not like?

424
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,000
No, thanks, but, you know, if
someone sees you, will be inconvenient.

425
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Maybe remove it?

426
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And I then did, and moped
mended.

427
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Moped?

428
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And the clutch done? Well, you
master! Well, thank you.

429
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:00,000
This, of course, all is well
Only now...

430
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Why deuce? After the decision
was correct.

431
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Bet! Taratara even jumped.
Very original solution!

432
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
- So what's the matter?
- These are your integrals.

433
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I shall never forget. Now, even in
Do not go to school.

434
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Two! At the end of the year!
The mother will eat me now!

435
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
- How does it eat?
- Well, to cut will be.

436
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:37,000
You know what, if I am wrong,
let me and nags.

437
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:43,000
- Listen, you learn to love?
- Yes.

438
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Exactly. Tomorrow you go to school
instead of me. Twos fix.

439
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:58,000
But you know, I can not
call myself Syroezhkin.

440
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:07,000
With you nothing but trouble. What is not
come up with something wrong, it's not some sort.

441
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Well, wait a minute.

442
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Come here.

443
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Help. Dana Electronics is
that it replaces Sergei Syroezhkin.

444
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Well.

445
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:36,000
And the gates do not need anything.

446
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Come on, after helping. From there, the whole
class seen.

447
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Well, you give. I can not
get used to your tricks.

448
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
- Instructions remember?
- Yes.

449
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Well, then, come on, move.

450
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Hello, "Intregal.

451
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
- What are you, Syroega?
- Do not bother me.

452
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Understandably. Yoga.

453
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Pose Sphinx.

454
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Come, sit down, sit fast,
sat, who they say. Sat.

455
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:47,000
A greasy.

456
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
And why?

457
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
- Hello, hello, boys.
- Hello!

458
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Sit down, sit down.

459
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
That gives.

460
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Iron small.

461
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
You want to fix a deuce?

462
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I can give 20 evidence
Pythagorean theorem.

463
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Are you joking?

464
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
You can start?

465
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,000
- Look, Pythagoras remembered.
- Exactly. You could have Gorapifa blurt.

466
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
About Pythagoras, we know little,
He lived in the sixth century BC,

467
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:47,000
and established a mathematical
school. The proof of the first.

468
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
The method of addition.

469
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
The method of decomposition.

470
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
The method of parquet.

471
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
And, finally, the bride's table.

472
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
And now let me give you
yesterday's decision problem.

473
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Since the integrals without integrals
and coordinate system.

474
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
It's just amazing, just
amazing.

475
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Good luck, academician.

476
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:28,000
It's amazing.

477
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Well, okay.
Well, that's for you too.

478
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Long enough for you. Well.

479
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Here it is! Freedom!

Guys, today we have a free
theme. Draw what everyone wants.

493

Just quiet. Okay? All
All clear? Yes?

494
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Please, can begin.

495
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Sergei!

496
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Why did you run away then from
park? Offended?

497
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
No, I'm not offended. For me
pursued.

498
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
- Chase?
- Yes, but do not talk about it.

499
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:22,000
- And where are you now going?
- At a training session. Competition soon.

500
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
And yet, who?

501
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Some other time.
Would you like to meet after school?

502
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Well, okay.

503
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Good, good.

504
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Come on.

505
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,000
What is this?

506
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
- Well, why did you, Serge?
- Just that you were well lit.

507
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Thank you, Serge. I put
you four.

508
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
- Why four?
- Hush, hush, boys, hush.

509
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
And why. Very nice
drawing. Listen, Syroezhkin,

510
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Give it to me, but I'll hang it
the wall.

511
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
- The figure is inaccurate.
- What?

512
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I mean, you glossed over life
a true artist

513
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
must be truthful.

514
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
- I love you why the school sent?
- Over five.

515
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
What's this?

516
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
- I wanted the best, but it...
- And she, she, it?

517
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:03,000
A true artist must
be truthful.

518
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Well, okay, so be it,
for the first time I forgive you.

519
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Listen, go and get some home
instead of me.

520
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
And then, awaken each morning
without doing anything, ask about school,

521
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
In general, replaced me completely.
Want?

522
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I.

523
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Hey, Al, wait.

524
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
You're only going to wear me not
forget.

525
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
- Why?
- Well, I can not like you.

526
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:42,000
All right.

527
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
- Hello, I came home from school.
- Well, dinner in the kitchen.

528
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Thank you. I just wash my hands
and dressed.

529
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:56,000
What?

530
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Quiet!

531
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Started.

532
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Well, well.

533
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Let one.

00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Please.

541
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,000
What's the matter, Gusev?
Deploy and recover.

542
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
See? You have the same voice as
pipe. Come on, come on, come on.

543
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I'm hearing no.

544
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,000
- All there is, but hearing no.
- Can I?

545
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Syroezhkin?

546
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:18,000
- Well, try.
- What is it?

547
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Do not "and".

548
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:30,000
- Silence.
- Please first.

549
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Well, well.

What are you doing? Sick or what?

Over there. No, wait.

601
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:05,000
No, let's say.

602
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,000
- Are you a long time so you can?
- No, I did recently.

603
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:16,000
What is it? Cast up!
Attention! Extend the lesson.

604
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
A phenomenon Syraezhkin...

classes.

606
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Hello

00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000

Korolkov.

610
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
- Smirnov.
- Very nice.

611
00:55:53,000 --> 00:56:21,000
No, no, well, what you do.

612
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Viktor Ivanovich, you without me
die of hunger.

613
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
- Well, that found the double?
- Not yet.

614
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
- But the photo was taken in our city.
- Very interesting.

615
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Very interesting. Yes, bad
we are predictors.

616
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Betray himself, it took several
days, and about him not hearing, nor spirit.

617
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,000
- Why are you so happy, eh?
- What do you mean?

618
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Electronic mastered in
our complex world.

619
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
And he is not alone, he obviously someone
helps.

620
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
He found his comrades
they understand each other.

621
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,000
- Do you understand? I see.
- I understand, let's eat.

622
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:09,000
You talk as if
conducting an experiment.

623
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I was just worried about the fate
Elika.

624
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
I wonder who is with him.

625
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Yes, this guy certainly
knows where his button.

626
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Hurry? What a guy, Hurry?

627
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,000
- Double. I reported to you.
- Find it. Urgently.

628
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:39,000
We are looking for.

629
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Listen, speak only the truth,
why the stars light up?

630
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
You know, this question
short answer is very difficult.

631
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I do not know a lot to explain.

632
00:57:52,000 --> 00:59:09,000
- And I thought, you know everything.
- No. Come on, talk on the road.

633
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Well, electronics, well, friend.
Ah, still did not bring lunch.

634
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Where, then, is what is, eh?

635
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Come on. Now again
compete. In my opinion, good.

00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I just like it.
In my opinion perfectly. So. Come on.

637
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000

00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:01,000
And the fashionable, and color is good, and
inexpensive. No, really, please?

639
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:06,000
- It is true that much.
- Scarecrow.

640
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Yes, Serge, has long wanted to ask,
Have you seen a textbook on Latin?

641
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I took him to read.

642
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
One of you I have left.

643
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,000
- Is it possible?
- Can. Well, what was interesting?

644
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,000
You bet. You know, it turns
number of words that we say

645
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I have Latin roots. Except
that is a very beautiful language.

646
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
- I'm sure he will learn.
- How to learn?

647
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
According to your textbook. And you
No other textbooks?

648
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,000
- What?
- Spanish, Greek, Swahili.

649
01:00:43,000 --> 01:01:12,000
- Swahili?
- Of course. It's very interesting.

650
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Hey, you sleepy woodcocks,
open the door of my father.

651
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:21,000
S., Pope arrived.

652
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000

- Someone with a lock dabbled.

01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Nonsense. Change that.

654
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:33,000
- As the son doing?
- Do Catkins? All right.

655
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,000
- Before all was lost in the garage.
- And we have a castle will change.

656
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
And now, some five, at home
sits, reads books

657
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
imagine, Latin carried away.

658
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:49,000
- Latin? And not buzit?
- Very surprised.

659
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:56,000
So, you say, some
Five? Listen, there is an idea.

660
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Serega.

661
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:08,000
You say now an A student?
Do you remember that I promised you?

662
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Come, let's go.
I am going to show you places!

S., dad one day

01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:47,000
But it is not pedagogically.

Sorry, I did not come on time,

"Rustling much rain
drizzling,

684
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,000
My soul is in trouble and anguish.

685
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I'm a man, in my opinion,
hopeless,

686
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Why am I making plans for the sand?

687
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Thickened over me evil
clouds

688
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:20,000
And suddenly I was out of work.

689
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Well, why I'm so unlucky?

690
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Well, why suffering - my
inheritance?

691
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Nobody is interested,

692
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,000
To my forever ruined
fate

693
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I got bitten for progress

694
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:50,000
And this terrible helped itself.

695
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Where to run and where to look for luck?

696
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:01,000
She hid herself in what region?

697
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:06,000
I can not sing, I'm afraid now
pay,

698
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:16,000
And in other matters, sing a song my own. "

699
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Castle changed.

700
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:50,000
What am I now get lost
what? I am a man or a man?

701
01:06:50,000 --> 01:07:03,000
And here, too.

702
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:08,000
- Who's there?
- It's me. I, Sergei.

703
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Sergei long home, go home,
boy.

704
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
- Who is it?
- A boy of some hooligans.

705
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Yes? Well, now I have his ears Nader.
Right now I catch him,

706
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:42,000
I'll beat him now.

707
01:07:42,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Sergey, where are you?

708
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Open, I'm the same person.

709
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I have the right to...

710
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,000
- Viktor Ivanovich?
- Yes?

711
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I found a double. This Sergei
Syroezhkin of the forty-fourth school.

712
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,000
- To bring it to you?
- No, no, in any case.

713
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
And do not go his eyes,
but then again he would escape.

714
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Viktor Ivanovich, why are you
think that this is electronics?

715
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
No, I just do not rule
such a possibility.

716
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:51,000
That way, you get to know
his class teacher

717
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:59,000
and learn everything about Syroezhkin. I
sure that the electronics somewhere nearby.

718
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I learned the name of a clone.
Through him, I hope to go to the robot.

719
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,000
- Long fidgeting, Hurry.
- Maybe you would like it?

720
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,000
- I carry out the order, chief.
- Do not be cross. About the button is not forgotten?

721
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:31,000
She is my dream.

722
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:39,000
One is.

723
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
And here is the second.

724
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Well, what are you staring at?
Syroezhkin - it's me.
