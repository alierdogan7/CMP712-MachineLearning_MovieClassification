1
00:03:07,266 --> 00:03:11,225
Begin the Turban Race!

2
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:31,256
Can't l worship with my
uncovered American head?

3
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,259
No, a turban is an essential
part of the ceremony.

4
00:03:37,296 --> 00:03:39,264
You don't know anything!

5
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:45,259
Why don't you find yourself an lndian
bride to help you tie your pants?

6
00:03:56,315 --> 00:04:00,274
They are noisy like children.

7
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,279
They have a right to enjoy today.

8
00:04:06,325 --> 00:04:08,293
There's no use in
restricting their fun.

9
00:04:09,328 --> 00:04:11,296
l'm talking about discipline.

10
00:04:12,331 --> 00:04:15,300
You should be disciplined too.
What do you mean?

11
00:04:16,335 --> 00:04:19,304
You're going to a music concert
during the Diwali festival.

12
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,307
How is the turban?

13
00:04:22,341 --> 00:04:26,300
Amrita, when you fix my turban
my music becomes strong.

14
00:04:28,347 --> 00:04:33,307
l'd be an average singer
without you.

15
00:04:36,355 --> 00:04:38,323
Come home early today.

16
00:04:38,357 --> 00:04:40,325
Why?

17
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:45,319
You should be here to talk
to your ltalian student.

18
00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:53,327
Don't worry he knows many
languages including Hindi.

19
00:04:53,372 --> 00:05:01,336
Did Nandini vacate her room
for the guest?

20
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,349
l had told her to,
but she became mad and left.

21
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,352
What's there to be mad about?
That's between you and your daughter.

22
00:05:07,386 --> 00:05:10,355
l'll call her.

23
00:07:43,542 --> 00:07:46,511
Where were you Nandini?

24
00:07:46,545 --> 00:07:48,513
Are you still angry?

25
00:07:50,549 --> 00:07:52,517
l went out to buy
this decoration.

26
00:07:53,552 --> 00:07:55,520
But where will you put it?
You must vacate your room.

27
00:07:56,555 --> 00:08:00,514
l'll never vacate my room!

28
00:08:02,561 --> 00:08:04,529
lt's takes time to decorate my room and
l don't like strangers staying in it.

29
00:08:05,564 --> 00:08:07,532
Why are you all after my room?

30
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:12,526
Because you have the best room.
We'll help you move out.

31
00:08:18,577 --> 00:08:24,538
There's not much in your room,
flowers, a chandelier, a diary and...

32
00:08:28,587 --> 00:08:32,546
lf you tease me l'll destroy
your floor decoration.

33
00:08:36,595 --> 00:08:39,564
Where were you Nandini?
You know l don't go to any

34
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,559
concerts without seeing you.
Oh are you a statue? But you

35
00:08:47,606 --> 00:08:51,565
can talk with your eyes.

36
00:08:53,612 --> 00:08:55,580
Did you vacate your room?

37
00:08:56,615 --> 00:09:01,575
You are still angry.

38
00:09:02,621 --> 00:09:06,580
The visitor is our guest. And
a guest is like God to us.

39
00:09:07,626 --> 00:09:09,594
Vacate your room before
my return.

40
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:13,598
The decoration is very pretty.

41
00:09:17,636 --> 00:09:22,596
Let ltalian come, l'll make
him leave within two days.

42
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:35,610
l'm going to a big house dad.
No, l've not left mom like you.

43
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:48,622
No, l don't need your help.
l'll find my way.

44
00:10:08,687 --> 00:10:10,655
The sand will show me the way.

45
00:10:14,693 --> 00:10:18,652
You're happy to see your son
in distress.

46
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:23,668
But listen. l will succeed
and learn my music.

47
00:10:24,703 --> 00:10:26,671
l'll live in lndia and
call mom in ltaly.

48
00:10:33,712 --> 00:10:38,672
Do you realize you've slapped
me for the first time.

49
00:10:39,718 --> 00:10:40,685
l am still going.

50
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,680
Why shouldn't l?
What's there?

51
00:10:50,729 --> 00:10:52,697
Oh ltalian! Get lost, suffer
hunger, never reach my room.

52
00:11:05,744 --> 00:11:13,708
What a jump! From ltaly into
the pool. How do you do?

53
00:11:19,758 --> 00:11:26,721
Meet all of us. My brother
Neelesh. My wife Pushpa.

54
00:11:27,766 --> 00:11:32,726
She is Parul, Shilpa,
Anapoorna, Haresh.

55
00:11:33,772 --> 00:11:35,740
And he is my brother,recently
returned from America, Tarun.

56
00:11:36,775 --> 00:11:39,744
Look at this boy's behaviour!

57
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:44,738
Oh don't worry.
His arrival has brought us laughter.

58
00:11:45,784 --> 00:11:50,744
His departure will bring us tears.

59
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,759
And l'm Bhairav

60
00:11:56,795 --> 00:11:58,763
What have you done to the
guest?

61
00:11:59,798 --> 00:12:05,759
Forgive us. Let me take you
to your room.

62
00:12:08,807 --> 00:12:10,775
Very jolly fellow.
We will have good time.

63
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:16,770
After eating Pushpa's dishes
he'll learn to speak Gujarati.

64
00:12:17,816 --> 00:12:21,775
What's the purpose in inviting
him in this house?

65
00:12:22,821 --> 00:12:26,780
What if he starts having an
affair with our young girls?

66
00:12:27,826 --> 00:12:31,785
Auntie Kamna! Can't you talk
well about anybody?

67
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,798
Vithal Singh, who's that lady?

68
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,801
She is the mistress of the house.

69
00:12:37,836 --> 00:12:41,795
Everybody listens to her judgment.
She has a very good heart.

70
00:12:44,843 --> 00:12:47,812
You've come on very auspicious
day. Today is Diwali.

71
00:12:52,851 --> 00:12:55,820
How was your journey. Have you
been swimming?

72
00:12:56,855 --> 00:12:58,823
l just fell into the pool.

73
00:13:00,859 --> 00:13:03,828
Vithal, show him to his room,
and give him breakfast.

74
00:13:04,863 --> 00:13:06,831
l'm going to the temple.

75
00:13:15,874 --> 00:13:18,843
l know, my husband says
the same thing.

76
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,848
What did you say?

77
00:13:25,884 --> 00:13:27,852
The ltalian is here!

78
00:13:35,894 --> 00:13:40,854
How are you?
Are you okay?

79
00:13:45,904 --> 00:13:49,863
My name is Sameer. You may
call me Sam, out of love.

80
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:52,877
What's your name?

81
00:13:53,912 --> 00:13:54,879
Nandini.

82
00:13:55,914 --> 00:13:57,882
Can l call you Nandu?

83
00:13:58,917 --> 00:13:59,884
Only Nandini.

84
00:14:02,921 --> 00:14:07,881
Your name is different
Does it mean Nandita Ben?

85
00:14:08,927 --> 00:14:10,895
A name need not have a meaning.

86
00:14:10,929 --> 00:14:12,897
And you need not light every
candle while looking at me.

87
00:14:13,932 --> 00:14:15,900
You move your eyes, first.

88
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:17,902
How can l? Your eyes have
hypnotized me.

89
00:14:18,937 --> 00:14:20,905
Why would they do that?

90
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,908
Careful, you might burn your hand.

91
00:14:27,946 --> 00:14:28,913
You were affected
by evil eyes.

92
00:14:29,948 --> 00:14:32,917
Must be yours, my eyes are
not like that.

93
00:14:33,952 --> 00:14:34,919
What are your eyes like?

94
00:14:35,954 --> 00:14:37,922
They can look into your soul.

95
00:14:37,956 --> 00:14:39,924
So, what do you see?

96
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,927
Lemon! Sour lemon.

97
00:14:45,964 --> 00:14:46,931
Move your eyes Nandu,
you might lose the rope.

98
00:14:46,965 --> 00:14:48,933
Let it be.

99
00:14:48,967 --> 00:14:50,935
The chandelier will fall.

100
00:14:50,969 --> 00:14:52,937
Let it fall.

101
00:14:52,971 --> 00:14:54,939
Glass will break.

102
00:14:54,973 --> 00:14:56,941
Let it break.

103
00:14:56,975 --> 00:14:58,943
And if the glass breaks
your eyes will blink.

104
00:14:59,978 --> 00:15:01,946
Let's see who blinks first.

105
00:15:26,004 --> 00:15:30,964
lf you continue looking at me
you will fall in love.

106
00:15:36,014 --> 00:15:37,982
Listen. Did you fall in love?

107
00:16:26,064 --> 00:16:28,032
His stuff is showing.

108
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:31,035
Move from here.

109
00:16:34,072 --> 00:16:36,040
Come on girls. Tell me what're
you whispering about?

110
00:16:38,076 --> 00:16:43,036
Won't you tell me?

111
00:16:44,082 --> 00:16:48,041
Nothing. That boy from ltaly.
They were looking at him.

112
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:54,047
So tell me. How does he look?

113
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:58,111
You have come here too.

114
00:17:59,157 --> 00:18:01,125
l heard you laughing.

115
00:18:03,161 --> 00:18:07,120
This is a home, not a park
that you just stroll through.

116
00:18:07,165 --> 00:18:13,126
Grandma, l'm Sameer, l've come
from ltaly. How do you do?

117
00:18:14,172 --> 00:18:17,141
Sameer - a cold gust of wind.

118
00:18:19,177 --> 00:18:23,136
He is a hailstorm. He'll
infect us all with running noses.

119
00:18:30,188 --> 00:18:34,147
You have no manners. Bathing
in the open, entering girls' room.

120
00:18:35,193 --> 00:18:39,152
lf you want to live here
you must follow our rules.

121
00:18:39,197 --> 00:18:40,164
Why are you so angry
Mandakini?

122
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:45,158
My name is Nandini

123
00:18:46,204 --> 00:18:48,172
You took my room, now you're
enticing me with your sweet talk.

124
00:18:51,209 --> 00:18:53,177
Tomorrow you will become
my father's favorite.

125
00:18:54,212 --> 00:18:56,180
Have you come to learn music
or mischief?

126
00:18:56,214 --> 00:18:58,182
You call yourself a singer,
but you look like a rogue.

127
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:17,190
He has made a mess of my room.
So disorganized.

128
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:23,207
Oh God! When will he go back?

129
00:19:30,248 --> 00:19:32,216
What are you doing in my room?

130
00:19:33,251 --> 00:19:35,219
This is my room you idiot.

131
00:19:36,254 --> 00:19:38,222
Now this is my room and l
can walk naked like this.

132
00:19:39,257 --> 00:19:42,226
l've come to pick up my diary.
You put on your clothes.

133
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:47,220
Oh diary. Get lost in desert
so you never reach my room...

134
00:19:49,267 --> 00:19:51,235
Don't read my diary, stop now.

135
00:19:54,272 --> 00:19:56,240
What have you done to my room?

136
00:19:57,275 --> 00:19:59,243
Don't you think this room
looks livelier than before?

137
00:20:00,278 --> 00:20:02,246
Nandini Ben, Darbar Sahib
wants to meet him.

138
00:20:04,282 --> 00:20:07,251
Go, go quickly.

139
00:20:16,294 --> 00:20:18,262
Have you come to eat or bathe?

140
00:20:18,296 --> 00:20:20,264
Go and put on your clothes.

141
00:20:38,316 --> 00:20:40,284
Oh. l went there in the towel.

142
00:20:40,318 --> 00:20:42,286
We were coming to stop you,
but you did not hear.

143
00:20:45,323 --> 00:20:53,287
Never mind, now to please father,
go and salute him like this...

144
00:20:56,334 --> 00:20:57,301
She is not misguiding me?

145
00:20:59,337 --> 00:21:03,296
No l will punish her for doing
that to our guest.

146
00:21:28,366 --> 00:21:30,334
What are you doing?

147
00:21:30,368 --> 00:21:32,336
Just saluting you sir.

148
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:35,339
Who told you to do this?

149
00:21:40,378 --> 00:21:42,346
Go and sit there.

150
00:21:55,393 --> 00:21:57,361
Hold on. Let him sing first.

151
00:21:58,396 --> 00:22:00,364
Let him eat first.
He's hungry.

152
00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:03,367
No. l'll decide right now.

153
00:22:05,403 --> 00:22:12,366
He has come from ltaly. Let me
see if he is worth teaching.

154
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:31,505
Very good. You know music
and you also have a good soul.

155
00:24:33,551 --> 00:24:35,519
By teaching you l might learn
something from you.

156
00:24:35,553 --> 00:24:37,521
May l teach you now sir?

157
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:54,527
My music is everything to me.

158
00:24:55,573 --> 00:24:57,541
Music is great like God.
You need purity of soul.

159
00:24:57,575 --> 00:25:06,540
An insincere person sings from
the throat.

160
00:25:07,585 --> 00:25:11,544
A hungry person from
the stomach.

161
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,558
But a truthful person sings
from his heart.

162
00:25:15,593 --> 00:25:18,562
l will teach you because you
sing from your heart.

163
00:25:20,598 --> 00:25:22,566
What about your fees sir?

164
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:25,569
My music is not for sale.

165
00:25:25,603 --> 00:25:29,562
l will ask for compensation
at a proper time.

166
00:25:30,608 --> 00:25:32,576
Or maybe l won't.

167
00:25:35,613 --> 00:25:37,581
My father is very happy.

168
00:29:11,829 --> 00:29:13,797
No l can't eat any more.

169
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:20,793
You've not eaten enough until
you belch like me.

170
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:24,808
You're young you must
eat more than 10-12 pooris...

171
00:30:17,895 --> 00:30:19,863
This secret should remain
between us, please...

172
00:30:20,898 --> 00:30:23,867
Grandma was right...
Sameer -like a gust of wind...

173
00:30:29,907 --> 00:30:31,875
Why are you after me?

174
00:32:08,005 --> 00:32:10,974
Are you thinking about me?
- Yes.

175
00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:13,977
No.

176
00:32:14,011 --> 00:32:15,979
No, you're thinking about me.

177
00:32:19,016 --> 00:32:20,984
No. Why should l?

178
00:32:21,018 --> 00:32:23,987
Then, who's in your thoughts?

179
00:32:25,022 --> 00:32:26,990
l was thinking about myself.

180
00:32:27,024 --> 00:32:28,992
What difference does it make.

181
00:32:30,027 --> 00:32:33,986
Don't get involved in wishful
thinking. You'll get hurt.

182
00:32:35,032 --> 00:32:37,000
What are you doing on the roof
so late in the night?

183
00:32:38,035 --> 00:32:44,998
l often come here to hear
father's music with the stars.

184
00:32:46,043 --> 00:32:50,002
Grandma says by changing their
paths, the stars change our destiny.

185
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:54,017
For me, the stars are my friends.

186
00:32:55,052 --> 00:32:58,021
What if they went against you?

187
00:33:00,057 --> 00:33:06,018
l would fight till they wrote
my destiny as l aspire.

188
00:33:07,064 --> 00:33:09,032
Do you believe in destiny.

189
00:33:11,068 --> 00:33:13,036
Sure. l can even read destiny.

190
00:33:15,072 --> 00:33:17,040
Really? Read mine.

191
00:33:18,075 --> 00:33:23,035
Palm reading is lndian style.
ltalians read the feet.

192
00:33:28,085 --> 00:33:31,054
Your feet are very beautiful.

193
00:33:40,097 --> 00:33:42,065
And they will soon take you aboard...

194
00:33:42,099 --> 00:33:44,067
Are you ticklish? So am l.

195
00:33:45,102 --> 00:33:47,070
They will take you aboard
to the love of your life.

196
00:33:54,111 --> 00:33:56,079
Madras

197
00:33:56,113 --> 00:33:58,081
Calcutta

198
00:33:58,115 --> 00:34:00,083
Bihar

199
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:14,097
A falling star!

200
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:24,107
What did you ask for?

201
00:34:25,142 --> 00:34:26,109
Nothing...

202
00:34:27,144 --> 00:34:32,104
My mother says never ask
anything from a broken star.

203
00:34:34,151 --> 00:34:35,118
You miss your mother?

204
00:34:37,154 --> 00:34:38,121
Because she is very far.

205
00:34:38,155 --> 00:34:39,122
And your father?

206
00:34:40,157 --> 00:34:43,126
He is very near to me.

207
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:52,135
And your girl friend?

208
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,137
l don't have a girl friend.

209
00:35:01,178 --> 00:35:03,146
Will you be my friend?

210
00:37:50,347 --> 00:37:51,314
Women can't compete with men.
- No, both are equal.

211
00:38:06,363 --> 00:38:07,330
What's the matter?

212
00:38:08,365 --> 00:38:11,334
Tell them how men are
superior to women.

213
00:38:12,369 --> 00:38:13,336
They're superior in many ways.

214
00:38:14,371 --> 00:38:20,332
Tell us what men can do but
women can't do.

215
00:38:21,378 --> 00:38:23,346
There are many things but l'll
give you one example.

216
00:38:27,384 --> 00:38:32,344
Can you do this?

217
00:38:49,406 --> 00:38:51,374
What're you doing here?
This is a women's only function.

218
00:38:52,409 --> 00:38:53,376
l was attracted by the music.

219
00:38:54,411 --> 00:38:56,379
Do you see any other man here?
- Yes Vithal...

220
00:38:57,414 --> 00:39:00,383
Vithal has looked after us
childhood.

221
00:39:01,418 --> 00:39:03,386
lf you are spotted, women
will beat you up. So go away.

222
00:39:04,421 --> 00:39:07,390
You've songs for all occasion?
- Yes... from birth to death.

223
00:39:08,425 --> 00:39:14,386
For all seasons, love songs
marriage songs, folk songs..

224
00:39:17,434 --> 00:39:20,403
You have not seen Bhavai? Let
me show you...

225
00:39:32,449 --> 00:39:33,416
What's that clapping song.

226
00:39:34,451 --> 00:39:36,419
That song is called Garbha.

227
00:39:47,464 --> 00:39:48,431
What else?
- Bhangra

228
00:39:50,467 --> 00:39:51,434
Now you're joking.

229
00:39:57,474 --> 00:39:59,442
May l tell you something?
- Yes.

230
00:40:07,484 --> 00:40:10,453
l love your voice.

231
00:40:11,488 --> 00:40:13,456
Only voice?

232
00:40:14,491 --> 00:40:16,459
And...

233
00:40:17,494 --> 00:40:19,462
Your hair.
- And?

234
00:40:20,497 --> 00:40:22,465
Your smile.
- And?

235
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,459
Your style of describing
falling stars.

236
00:40:28,505 --> 00:40:30,473
And? Say it quickly.

237
00:40:35,512 --> 00:40:40,472
Your mom, your father, this food,
flowers, furniture.

238
00:40:41,518 --> 00:40:44,487
You are just a lemon.

239
00:40:51,528 --> 00:40:54,497
Even till the end, l didn't say it.

240
00:40:55,532 --> 00:40:58,501
Why are you laughing.
You don't know!

241
00:41:08,545 --> 00:41:11,514
The marriage procession has
arrived and you are not ready!

242
00:41:12,549 --> 00:41:14,517
Get ready and check on Anu.

243
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,528
Sour Lemon!

244
00:41:25,562 --> 00:41:27,530
l look better than you do.

245
00:41:28,565 --> 00:41:30,533
Just see when l get dressed.

246
00:41:34,571 --> 00:41:36,539
As if she is Miss World.

247
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,548
Are you ready Anu?

248
00:41:45,582 --> 00:41:47,550
Give me a few minutes.

249
00:41:48,585 --> 00:41:52,544
You must go with me Anu.
l can't live without you.

250
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:56,559
You don't know how l spent
last the six months without you.

251
00:42:00,597 --> 00:42:04,556
l left to become capable of
asking your hand in marriage.

252
00:42:06,603 --> 00:42:08,571
Now leave everything
and elope with me.

253
00:42:09,606 --> 00:42:11,574
The procession is at the door,
and you want me to elope with you!

254
00:42:12,609 --> 00:42:14,577
My parents will commit suicide
out of shame...

255
00:42:14,611 --> 00:42:16,579
it's too late now. Go away.

256
00:42:17,614 --> 00:42:21,573
What happened Anu?
- Nothing, l dropped a vase.

257
00:42:30,627 --> 00:42:33,596
Some day we'll meet again Anu.

258
00:42:40,637 --> 00:42:42,605
Thank God you opened the door.
What were you doing.

259
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,608
How do l look Nandini?

260
00:42:45,642 --> 00:42:49,601
lt takes time to be a
first time bride.

261
00:42:49,646 --> 00:42:51,614
Are you afraid?
- Little bit.

262
00:42:52,649 --> 00:42:54,617
l am so happy for you Anu.

263
00:42:54,651 --> 00:42:56,619
You get ready...
l want to see grandma.

264
00:48:57,013 --> 00:48:58,981
You have no shame.

265
00:49:00,016 --> 00:49:01,984
Nandini please listen.
- l don't want to hear you.

266
00:49:03,019 --> 00:49:05,988
Why do you punish me?
l was just joking.

267
00:49:10,026 --> 00:49:11,994
Do you want to hear what l
wanted to say last night?

268
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:15,998
l don't want to hear with so
many people around.

269
00:49:17,033 --> 00:49:19,001
Leave me alone.
- Please let me tell you.

270
00:49:32,048 --> 00:49:36,007
Open the door. How many times
should l ask your forgiveness.

271
00:49:37,053 --> 00:49:41,012
l was mad for what you did
in front of so many people.

272
00:49:43,059 --> 00:49:46,028
The ceremonies are starting.
Don't spoil the fun please.

273
00:49:47,063 --> 00:49:50,032
Tell me what was in your mind.
l'm ready to listen now.

274
00:49:51,067 --> 00:49:55,026
l was going to say that you do
not deserve my love.

275
00:49:57,073 --> 00:50:02,033
Really? With so many guests
someone will approve of me.

276
00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:08,039
And when he asks for my hand,
you'll repent Sour Lemon.

277
00:56:31,467 --> 00:56:36,427
l arranged a meeting with
Nandini but l couldn't find you.

278
00:56:42,478 --> 00:56:45,447
l'd be tongue-tied in front
of such a beautiful girl.

279
00:56:46,482 --> 00:56:50,441
You could have told her
certain things with your eyes.

280
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:57,459
You must meet her.

281
00:56:58,494 --> 00:57:00,462
What if she doesn't
approve of me.

282
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,468
She is fair you're dark, she
has blue eyes you've black,

283
00:57:07,503 --> 00:57:10,472
she is popular and you can't
even sing in your bathroom.

284
00:57:15,511 --> 00:57:20,471
But you have something special.
- What?

285
00:57:20,516 --> 00:57:22,484
Your beautiful heart.

286
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:27,478
There's one thing more.
- What's that?

287
00:57:31,527 --> 00:57:34,496
You're changing the topic.
Do you like Nandini or not?

288
00:57:40,536 --> 00:57:42,504
l like her.

289
00:57:43,539 --> 00:57:45,507
Then touch a hand for Nandini.

290
00:57:53,549 --> 00:57:56,518
Touch one more time.

291
00:57:57,553 --> 00:58:00,522
Sanyukta, no matter which hand
l touch, Nandini will be mine.

292
00:58:08,564 --> 00:58:13,524
Anu got married. Nandini has
grown up.

293
00:58:13,569 --> 00:58:15,537
Have you thought about Nandini?
- What's there to think about?

294
00:58:16,572 --> 00:58:19,541
Touch one of my hands.

295
00:58:23,579 --> 00:58:25,547
What's this childishness.

296
00:58:31,587 --> 00:58:33,555
l knew you'd touch this hand.

297
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:39,550
There's a very good marriage
proposal for Nandini.

298
00:58:40,596 --> 00:58:43,565
Vikramjit the lawyer, has sought
Nandini's hand for Vanraj.

299
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:47,558
Boy and family are good.
On Holi we'll go their town,

300
00:58:48,604 --> 00:58:51,573
visit their home and
give our consent.

301
00:58:52,608 --> 00:58:54,576
What do you say?

302
00:58:58,614 --> 00:59:03,574
A daughter has to
leave one day.

303
00:59:05,621 --> 00:59:07,589
Does he sing?

304
00:59:09,625 --> 00:59:11,593
You never think about
anything except music...

305
00:59:12,628 --> 00:59:15,597
yes he sings, but he is not
melodious.

306
00:59:26,642 --> 00:59:28,610
Look at Nandini's picture. She
spoiled the family portrait.

307
00:59:29,645 --> 00:59:33,604
All are looking at the camera,
she seems to have a bad cold.

308
00:59:58,674 --> 01:00:00,642
Sameer why do ltalians
eat pizza?

309
01:00:01,677 --> 01:00:03,645
Because we don't have grandma's
favorite Gujarati dishes.

310
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,648
Sameer you always say
something very sweet.

311
01:00:07,683 --> 01:00:09,651
Because he's a sweet boy.

312
01:00:10,686 --> 01:00:13,655
What happened? Don't like the
food. Nandini cooked it.

313
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:16,658
lt's hot.

314
01:00:17,693 --> 01:00:21,652
Hot food is for hot girls -
not for sweet stupid boys.

315
01:00:22,698 --> 01:00:24,666
Well said Nandini.

316
01:00:40,716 --> 01:00:46,677
What an insane thing to do.
Stop Sameer. Leave it.

317
01:00:49,725 --> 01:00:51,693
Why do you torture him?

318
01:00:52,728 --> 01:00:54,696
What happened?

319
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:56,698
Sameer ate lot of chilies.

320
01:00:57,733 --> 01:01:00,702
His mouth must be burning.
Give him some honey.

321
01:01:01,737 --> 01:01:04,706
Go and ask his forgiveness.

322
01:01:05,741 --> 01:01:09,700
He has eaten chilies. He will
see its reaction in morning.

323
01:02:28,824 --> 01:02:35,787
lt's the prize of love...
and my deserved punishment.

324
01:03:40,896 --> 01:03:43,865
Mommy! Wouldn't it be wonderful
to fly like a kite in the sky.

325
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:46,868
A daughter is like a kite. She flies
freely above the roof before marriage,

326
01:03:47,903 --> 01:03:49,871
and then gives control to someone
else after her marriage.

327
01:03:50,906 --> 01:03:53,875
As happened to Anu, and now it
is Nandini's turn.

328
01:03:54,910 --> 01:03:56,878
Not so soon.

329
01:03:56,912 --> 01:03:58,880
No use pretending...

330
01:03:59,915 --> 01:04:03,874
you're so fond of flying, why
don't you get married sooner?

331
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,888
What's it to you, Auntie? l'll
get married when l want to.

332
01:04:07,923 --> 01:04:09,891
Will you decide about your
own marriage?

333
01:04:09,925 --> 01:04:12,894
Yes it will be my decision.

334
01:04:13,929 --> 01:04:15,897
You are behaving as if l don't
know anything...

335
01:04:16,932 --> 01:04:18,900
l keep my eyes open on
all your flights.

336
01:04:19,935 --> 01:04:21,903
You have to live with your own
destiny. Some kites fly high

337
01:04:22,938 --> 01:04:25,907
in the sky, others don't leave
the ground... like you.

338
01:04:26,942 --> 01:04:29,911
Nandini, don't talk to
your elders like this.

339
01:04:30,946 --> 01:04:32,914
Seek her forgiveness

340
01:04:38,954 --> 01:04:41,923
Forgive her Kamna.
- lt's okay. She is a child.

341
01:04:42,958 --> 01:04:46,917
We are talking to a very good
family about her marriage...

342
01:04:47,963 --> 01:04:50,932
lf the horoscopes match we'll
soon finalize her marriage.

343
01:04:57,973 --> 01:05:01,932
Her mother's matching her horoscope
and she is romancing in sky.

344
01:05:02,978 --> 01:05:04,946
Wouldn't it be fun if her kite
was lost in the sky?

345
01:05:05,981 --> 01:05:07,949
Leave it Kamna.

346
01:09:53,268 --> 01:10:00,231
Nandini, l defeated your father
in the kite flying race.

347
01:10:02,277 --> 01:10:04,245
lt would have been fun if you
were holding my thread-wheel.

348
01:10:08,283 --> 01:10:11,252
l neither like paper toys nor
holding wheels for your kites.

349
01:10:13,288 --> 01:10:14,255
One day someone will steal me
from you right under your nose

350
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:18,259
and you won't do anything
except stare at the sky.

351
01:10:18,293 --> 01:10:20,261
l'll do everything!

352
01:10:20,295 --> 01:10:22,263
l will break him,
beat him, destroy him.

353
01:10:23,298 --> 01:10:25,266
Do you have any idea how much
ridicule l've suffered.

354
01:10:26,301 --> 01:10:29,270
Break him, beat him...
always joking, always immature

355
01:10:41,316 --> 01:10:44,285
They are after my marriage.
People will come to see me..

356
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:50,280
ask me to demonstrate how l walk...
how l sit, sing, laugh and...

357
01:10:51,326 --> 01:10:56,286
l'll have to do it,
but you won't do anything.

358
01:10:57,332 --> 01:11:01,291
You'll just keep
looking from a corner.

359
01:11:02,337 --> 01:11:05,306
You won't care if they approve
and take me away from you,

360
01:11:06,341 --> 01:11:08,309
you won't care...
if l go to someone else...

361
01:11:09,344 --> 01:11:11,312
if l am married to someone else...

362
01:11:12,347 --> 01:11:13,314
...if l die.

363
01:11:27,362 --> 01:11:30,331
l'll talk to your father.

364
01:11:31,366 --> 01:11:34,335
How can you tell to my father
what you have not told me so far?

365
01:11:50,385 --> 01:11:52,353
Don't Sameer. lt's a sin.

366
01:11:53,388 --> 01:11:56,357
lt's not a sin.

367
01:11:57,392 --> 01:11:58,359
What if something happened?

368
01:11:59,394 --> 01:12:01,362
Like what?

369
01:12:01,396 --> 01:12:03,364
A child.

370
01:12:04,399 --> 01:12:07,368
A child won't come like this.

371
01:12:08,403 --> 01:12:11,372
lt's not right Sameer.
Father will never agree.

372
01:12:14,409 --> 01:12:17,378
Why won't he agree?

373
01:12:17,412 --> 01:12:19,380
lsn't this sinful?

374
01:12:20,415 --> 01:12:22,383
No, it's not sinful.

375
01:12:23,418 --> 01:12:25,386
You won't leave me?
- Never.

376
01:12:37,432 --> 01:12:39,400
There is someone here.

377
01:12:40,435 --> 01:12:42,403
Where are you going?
- l must leave.

378
01:12:43,438 --> 01:12:45,406
Where is the bloody book.

379
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,408
Why are you here Kamna auntie?

380
01:12:48,443 --> 01:12:50,411
l wanted to read a book.

381
01:12:50,445 --> 01:12:53,414
Which one?
What're you doing here?

382
01:12:54,449 --> 01:12:56,417
Didn't you go kite flying?
lt was so enjoyable.

383
01:12:57,452 --> 01:13:00,421
l was arranging my books.
- First arrange your dress.

384
01:13:02,457 --> 01:13:06,416
Keep to your affairs, Auntie.
Don't interfere in my life.

385
01:13:07,462 --> 01:13:14,425
l've given you a long rope,
you'll fall flat if l pull it.

386
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:18,439
Found it? How is this book.

387
01:13:19,474 --> 01:13:21,442
lt's in English

388
01:13:21,476 --> 01:13:25,435
So what.
l'm even ready to learn ltalian.

389
01:13:30,485 --> 01:13:34,444
The horoscopes match completely.

390
01:13:34,489 --> 01:13:37,458
Congratulations Darbar.

391
01:13:38,493 --> 01:13:43,453
Did the horoscopes match?
- Yes. All 36 qualities match.

392
01:13:44,499 --> 01:13:46,467
l knew it.
- Give the sweets to everyone.

393
01:13:47,502 --> 01:13:52,462
Wait! Let me give one to the man
whose marriage has been arranged.

394
01:13:54,509 --> 01:13:58,468
Hold on. You can't be our son-
in-law by matching horoscopes.

395
01:13:59,514 --> 01:14:01,482
You are marrying a musician's
daughter. We want to make sure

396
01:14:02,517 --> 01:14:08,478
you would be in tune with her.
We want to hear you sing.

397
01:14:09,524 --> 01:14:11,492
You want me to sing?

398
01:14:12,527 --> 01:14:14,495
He must pass this test.

399
01:14:15,530 --> 01:14:20,490
Let him hear. We will test
Nandini's courtroom skills.

400
01:14:49,564 --> 01:14:58,529
Enough. You lack melody and
rhythm. Nandini will fix that.

401
01:14:59,574 --> 01:15:09,540
Your voice has sincerity.
You'll make my daughter happy.

402
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:17,558
Sky is full of stars, grandma.

403
01:15:18,593 --> 01:15:21,562
Looks like a thousand lovers are
holding lights in their hands.

404
01:15:22,597 --> 01:15:26,556
Light is within the lovers.

405
01:15:27,602 --> 01:15:32,562
How do you know this grandma?
- Love told me.

406
01:15:33,608 --> 01:15:35,576
You too have been in love?

407
01:15:35,610 --> 01:15:39,569
Love colors everybody.
Doesn't spare anybody.

408
01:15:40,615 --> 01:15:42,583
Did you have a love marriage?

409
01:15:43,618 --> 01:15:45,586
First marriage, then love.

410
01:15:46,621 --> 01:15:50,580
How did it happen grandma?

411
01:15:51,626 --> 01:15:56,586
l married at age 1 4. l was
combing my hair on the roof.

412
01:15:57,632 --> 01:15:59,600
Your grandpa was flying a kite
on the adjacent roof.

413
01:16:01,636 --> 01:16:03,604
He slipped from the roof.

414
01:16:04,639 --> 01:16:06,607
l ran to his rescue.

415
01:16:06,641 --> 01:16:08,609
He was hanging from the balcony.

416
01:16:09,644 --> 01:16:11,612
l gave him my hand.

417
01:16:12,647 --> 01:16:15,616
As he touched it, currents
passed through my body.

418
01:16:16,651 --> 01:16:20,610
Then?
- Our eyes met. Love sprang.

419
01:16:21,656 --> 01:16:26,616
He kissed, my first kiss.

420
01:16:27,662 --> 01:16:29,630
Then you became a mother.

421
01:16:30,665 --> 01:16:33,634
You stupid girl. Kissing
doesn't make you a mother.

422
01:16:38,673 --> 01:16:42,632
Then?
- Then life began with kids.

423
01:16:43,678 --> 01:16:44,645
Then?
- Home filled with happiness.

424
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:48,649
Then?
- Our children got married...

425
01:16:49,684 --> 01:16:54,644
dancing, singing, functions.
- Then?

426
01:16:55,690 --> 01:17:00,650
You came, and came laughter
and lullabies for you kids

427
01:17:01,696 --> 01:17:04,665
your quarrels and friendships

428
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:09,659
Then?
- Then nothing.

429
01:17:26,721 --> 01:17:28,689
Then?
- Then after 60 years, two

430
01:17:29,724 --> 01:17:31,692
lovers met on this same roof

431
01:17:32,727 --> 01:17:36,686
and then grandma
caught them red-handed.

432
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:48,709
Your father has always desired
a musician husband for you.

433
01:17:49,744 --> 01:17:55,705
You would have the same dream.
l want to discuss it with you.

434
01:17:57,752 --> 01:18:02,712
l too want to tell you
something. May l tell you?

435
01:18:03,758 --> 01:18:05,726
Okay, you tell me first.

436
01:18:06,761 --> 01:18:11,721
First you promise you won't be
angry after hearing me.

437
01:18:11,766 --> 01:18:13,734
Angry? But why?
What's the matter?

438
01:18:14,769 --> 01:18:18,728
ln fact l wanted to tell you...

439
01:18:19,774 --> 01:18:23,733
Anu has come from her in-laws
home. She is very distressed.

440
01:18:23,778 --> 01:18:25,746
Come quickly!

441
01:18:26,781 --> 01:18:34,745
Listen Anu, you must return
to your in-laws' home.

442
01:18:35,790 --> 01:18:38,759
No father, l'll never go back to
that house.

443
01:18:39,794 --> 01:18:42,763
Anu you must forget Bharat and
go back to your in-laws.

444
01:18:43,798 --> 01:18:45,766
l'll kill myself but l'll
never go back to that house...

445
01:18:46,801 --> 01:18:49,770
l'll never spend another night
as a corpse in that man's bed.

446
01:18:53,808 --> 01:18:55,776
A daughter's marriage takes
place by her father's will.

447
01:18:56,811 --> 01:18:59,780
Traditionally, her husband is
her God after her marriage...

448
01:19:00,815 --> 01:19:04,774
Anu must return to her home
after the Holi festival..

449
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:11,781
No! Turn back this shameless
girl today. l can't stand her.

450
01:19:12,827 --> 01:19:18,788
Beating a grown up daughter is
against our tradition.

451
01:19:19,834 --> 01:19:24,794
By Holi things will cool down.

452
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,808
Fatherdy, Anu will never be happy
in that house.

453
01:19:28,843 --> 01:19:30,811
See how badly she was beaten.

454
01:19:31,846 --> 01:19:33,814
Don't interfere in the
decisions of your elders.

455
01:19:34,849 --> 01:19:36,817
At least ask the person whose
life is at stake.

456
01:19:38,853 --> 01:19:40,821
How can she live with a man
she doesn't even love?

457
01:19:49,864 --> 01:19:51,832
Leave!

458
01:19:55,870 --> 01:19:57,838
Leave!

459
01:19:59,874 --> 01:20:03,833
Sameer has arranged everything
and Bharat is waiting for you.

460
01:20:04,879 --> 01:20:06,847
Why are you giving
me all this?

461
01:20:08,883 --> 01:20:10,851
ls this right? Family
disgrace?

462
01:20:11,886 --> 01:20:15,845
What if something happens to Bharat?
- What you're doing is right.

463
01:20:16,891 --> 01:20:20,850
You must live your own life.

464
01:20:24,899 --> 01:20:29,859
ls everything arranged.
- Yes Bharat is waiting.

465
01:20:31,906 --> 01:20:37,867
Hi. You are not afraid? l am afraid.
l am afraid of Nandini's father.

466
01:21:17,952 --> 01:21:21,911
Anu will be happy. We've done
a great job of uniting them.

467
01:21:27,962 --> 01:21:31,921
lt was so romantic. May we
marry by eloping to ltaly?

468
01:21:32,967 --> 01:21:35,936
Why should we elope? You
will ask for my hand from my father.

469
01:21:39,974 --> 01:21:41,942
Who is responsible for this.
Where's Anu?

470
01:21:47,982 --> 01:21:56,947
Tell me. l'll kill you.

471
01:22:13,007 --> 01:22:14,975
Why are you beating him?

472
01:22:16,010 --> 01:22:17,978
You're responsible for this.
- What are you talking about?

473
01:22:19,013 --> 01:22:22,972
l asked you to return
her quickly, you didn't agree...

474
01:22:24,018 --> 01:22:29,979
Anu has eloped with someone else.
See the mangalsutra and this note.

475
01:22:31,025 --> 01:22:33,994
She spitted on us and stains
have fallen on your face too.

476
01:22:35,029 --> 01:22:36,997
Keep your voice down.

477
01:22:38,032 --> 01:22:41,001
Because you are the elder you
can't bear it when others speak.

478
01:22:42,036 --> 01:22:44,004
By what right you do force your
decision on us.

479
01:22:45,039 --> 01:22:47,007
Why should we suffer
for your mistakes?

480
01:22:48,042 --> 01:22:51,011
lt's your fault. You did not
teach our family's traditions

481
01:22:51,045 --> 01:22:54,014
to your children and now you
are insulting me.

482
01:22:54,048 --> 01:22:56,016
l'm not insulting you.

483
01:22:56,050 --> 01:22:59,019
You'll know my suffering when
Nandini elopes with someone.

484
01:23:00,054 --> 01:23:02,022
Stop, you have said enough.

485
01:23:03,057 --> 01:23:07,016
Before blaming others you must
take care of your own home.

486
01:23:08,062 --> 01:23:13,022
When you find out what your
daughter has been doing,

487
01:23:13,067 --> 01:23:16,036
your head will fall in shame.
- Shut up!

488
01:23:16,070 --> 01:23:21,030
l'll not tolerate any nonsense
spoken about Nandini.

489
01:23:22,076 --> 01:23:30,040
She is my faith, she is my teacher,
she is as pure as my music.

490
01:23:31,085 --> 01:23:36,045
My music will die if she is
found to be impure...

491
01:23:37,091 --> 01:23:39,059
l'll never sing thereafter.

492
01:23:41,095 --> 01:23:47,056
lf you have that much faith
call her. See what's truth.

493
01:23:55,109 --> 01:24:00,069
Nandini ... Nandini ...!

494
01:24:00,114 --> 01:24:02,082
How can she hear you
if she is not home?

495
01:24:07,121 --> 01:24:12,081
Go out and hear her tunes.

496
01:24:18,132 --> 01:24:23,092
With the first step we'll vow
to share happiness and pain.

497
01:24:25,139 --> 01:24:30,099
With the second you'll vow
to protect my life and honor,

498
01:24:31,145 --> 01:24:34,114
and you will give me
love and respect.

499
01:24:41,155 --> 01:24:45,114
During the fourth step, l will
ask to go ahead of you.

500
01:24:47,161 --> 01:24:50,130
Why?
- So if death comes l can

501
01:24:50,164 --> 01:24:59,129
embrace it before you do.
We'll embrace death together.

502
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:27,167
l did not expect it from you.
What have you done to us?

503
01:25:28,202 --> 01:25:34,163
lt has been going on for eight
months and nobody knew it?

504
01:25:35,209 --> 01:25:38,178
You did not confide in me!

505
01:25:39,213 --> 01:25:41,181
l will hate you for that.
- People become mad in love

506
01:25:42,216 --> 01:25:46,175
Never thought he will do this.
- Now l feel that madness...

507
01:25:47,221 --> 01:25:51,180
can't remember the moment
when l started loving him...

508
01:25:55,229 --> 01:25:57,197
Nobody has the choice to love
in this household.

509
01:25:58,232 --> 01:26:00,200
There are certain traditions
of our dynasty...

510
01:26:00,234 --> 01:26:05,194
people respect your father
you bowed his head in shame.

511
01:26:07,241 --> 01:26:09,209
How do you think he will
tolerate this pain.

512
01:26:09,243 --> 01:26:11,211
We lifted our heads to
look at the stars...

513
01:26:12,246 --> 01:26:14,214
that brief moment turned
into such deep relationship...

514
01:26:15,249 --> 01:26:19,208
Sameer says father loves him.
He'll surely agree mom

515
01:26:20,254 --> 01:26:26,215
How will he agree to a
relationship with a foreigner

516
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:28,228
about whom we know nothing?

517
01:26:28,262 --> 01:26:30,230
Your marriage to Vanraj has
been decided.

518
01:26:30,264 --> 01:26:32,232
We have matched
your horoscopes.

519
01:26:32,266 --> 01:26:34,234
While explaining Hindu marriage
rites when we took seven steps

520
01:26:35,269 --> 01:26:38,238
it appeared whole universe
was celebrating our union.

521
01:26:43,277 --> 01:26:48,237
Seven steps? Marriage rites?
Have you crossed boundaries?

522
01:26:51,285 --> 01:26:54,254
Have you done something for
which we should be ashamed?

523
01:26:54,288 --> 01:26:59,248
Tell me Nandini... has he
touched you anywhere?

524
01:27:01,295 --> 01:27:04,264
Here...

525
01:27:05,299 --> 01:27:08,268
and here...

526
01:27:09,303 --> 01:27:12,272
and here mom...

527
01:27:13,307 --> 01:27:15,275
Stop Nandini... l can't bear.

528
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:24,274
he has touched my soul, his
eyes watch me from inside..

529
01:27:25,319 --> 01:27:28,288
don't break me in two parts,
l will be dead without him...

530
01:27:29,323 --> 01:27:33,282
l only belong to him...
l love him too much mom...

531
01:27:33,327 --> 01:27:39,288
make father agree to
our marriage.

532
01:27:40,334 --> 01:27:42,302
Control your emotions and
listen Nandini... l will try

533
01:27:43,337 --> 01:27:54,305
to persuade your father,
don't move until l come back.

534
01:28:00,354 --> 01:28:10,320
l have abandoned my music,
l've nothing more to teach you.

535
01:28:13,367 --> 01:28:18,327
Why are you punishing yourself
for our mistakes?

536
01:28:19,373 --> 01:28:21,341
l've done nothing wrong. l've come
to seek Nandini's hand.

537
01:28:22,376 --> 01:28:25,345
lt is time for compensation.

538
01:28:27,381 --> 01:28:33,342
On the oath of the knowledge
l've given you, you will promise

539
01:28:34,388 --> 01:28:40,349
to neither meet Nandini
nor keep any relation with her.

540
01:28:45,399 --> 01:28:48,368
This is my compensation.

541
01:29:04,418 --> 01:29:09,378
Can l see Nandini one
last time?

542
01:29:31,445 --> 01:29:35,404
Sameer is going Nandini!

543
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:51,420
Your father didn't agree...
he won't listen to me.
