00:00:16,835 --> 00:00:18,769
<i>And that's what you missed
on...# glee. #</i>

2
00:00:26,244 --> 00:00:28,079
Hey, fella.

3
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,381
<i>So unless my recent write-up
here in splits magazine</i>

4
00:00:30,382 --> 00:00:33,117
Naming me cheerleading
coach of the decade
has me driven

5
00:00:33,118 --> 00:00:36,320
Completely insane,
I'm pretty sure you and I

6
00:00:36,321 --> 00:00:38,222
Had an agreement that you
were going to show me

7
00:00:38,223 --> 00:00:39,824
Your glee club set list
for sectionals.

8
00:00:39,825 --> 00:00:42,259
Sorry, sue. I didn't think
you were all that interested

9
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,028
In glee club anymore.
Not interested?

10
00:00:44,029 --> 00:00:46,797
Well, I'm the fine arts
administrator or something.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,302
Um... Well, I will make sure
you get a copy.

12
00:00:51,303 --> 00:00:52,737
That'd be fantastic.

13
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:54,405
I'd hate to have to go
to figgins about this.

14
00:00:55,774 --> 00:00:57,441
Hey, will.
Yes?

15
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,578
I'd like my magazine
back, please.

16
00:01:05,117 --> 00:01:06,851
Thank you.

17
00:01:06,852 --> 00:01:09,453
<i>Will:
Here's the problem
with sue sylvester:</i>

18
00:01:09,454 --> 00:01:11,956
<i>You never quite know
where you stand.</i>

19
00:01:11,957 --> 00:01:13,691
<i>I knew she was up to something.</i>

20
00:01:13,692 --> 00:01:15,359
Five, six, seven, eight.

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,128
Step ball change,
step, step,

22
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:19,063
Unh and seven, eight.

23
00:01:19,064 --> 00:01:21,265
Step ball change,
step, step, unh,

24
00:01:21,266 --> 00:01:23,300
You guys go.
Step ball...

25
00:01:23,301 --> 00:01:25,002
Brittany?

26
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:28,773
Coach sylvester
didn't tell me to do this.

27
00:01:28,774 --> 00:01:30,808
(school bell ringing)

28
00:01:30,809 --> 00:01:32,543
<i>It kept getting worse.</i>

29
00:01:32,544 --> 00:01:34,245
Hey there, pal.
Would you remind
me once again

30
00:01:34,246 --> 00:01:36,647
The names of the schools
you'll be competing against
at sectionals?

31
00:01:36,648 --> 00:01:39,083
Jane addams academy
and haverbrook school
for the deaf.

32
00:01:39,084 --> 00:01:40,518
Got it. What are
their zip codes?

33
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:42,453
(school bell ringing)

34
00:01:42,454 --> 00:01:45,556
<i>She's leaking our competitive
set list to the other schools.</i>

35
00:01:45,557 --> 00:01:48,092
If the other glee clubs get
set lists and videos,

36
00:01:48,093 --> 00:01:50,361
They'll know exactly
how to beat us at sectionals.

37
00:01:50,362 --> 00:01:52,830
Well first, don't let
sue distract you, all right?

38
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:55,332
And if you can't take
mohammad to the mountain,

39
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,668
Then you got to get mohammad
to bring the mountain

40
00:01:57,669 --> 00:01:59,437
Down to his house.

41
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:01,806
Mohammad's house,
wherever he's staying.

42
00:02:01,807 --> 00:02:03,808
I don't understand.
Look, you should drive

43
00:02:03,809 --> 00:02:05,876
Over to jane addams academy

44
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:07,845
And ask the director
point-blank.

45
00:02:07,846 --> 00:02:09,346
If something's going on,
you'll know.

46
00:02:10,882 --> 00:02:14,051
Hmm.

47
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:20,553

00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:22,860
(door buzzing)

49
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:29,100
All right. Oh, thanks.

50
00:02:30,335 --> 00:02:32,803
(door buzzing)

51
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:34,038
(security wand beeps)

52
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,184
You're a good kid, aphasia.

53
00:02:47,185 --> 00:02:48,519
Why did you try to rob a bank?

54
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,221
Because, ms. Hitchens,

55
00:02:50,222 --> 00:02:51,722
That's where they keep
the money.

56
00:02:51,723 --> 00:02:53,791
Go back to class.

57
00:02:53,792 --> 00:02:55,359
Uh, hi, ms. Hitchens.

58
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,195
I'm will schuester
from mckinley high.

59
00:02:58,196 --> 00:03:00,931
Aphasia! Give mr. Schuester
his wallet back.

60
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:09,306
Wow, she's... She's good.

61
00:03:09,307 --> 00:03:10,741
Um...

62
00:03:10,742 --> 00:03:12,376
Thank you.
Thank you for seeing me.

63
00:03:12,377 --> 00:03:14,812
We don't get a lot of other
educators paying us visits.

64
00:03:14,813 --> 00:03:16,781
Right. Um...

65
00:03:16,782 --> 00:03:18,282
Well, the reason
I'm here

66
00:03:18,283 --> 00:03:20,351
Is... A little weird.

67
00:03:20,352 --> 00:03:21,552
So I guess the best thing

68
00:03:21,553 --> 00:03:23,220
For me to do is just
come right out with it.

69
00:03:25,157 --> 00:03:26,957
I think our cheerleading coach

70
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,260
Has been passing along
our set list for sectionals

71
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:31,228
To you.
What kind of messed up school
are you people running?

72
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:32,997
You think that
because our students are

73
00:03:32,998 --> 00:03:34,431
Thieves and arsonists,
that we're cheaters, too.

74
00:03:34,432 --> 00:03:36,000
No, no, no, no, I...

75
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:37,835
It's not that you,
it's, it's sue.

76
00:03:37,836 --> 00:03:39,770
Do you know that
we don't have costumes?

77
00:03:39,771 --> 00:03:42,506
Or even an auditorium.

78
00:03:42,507 --> 00:03:44,275
Our show choir has to practice
out in the rec yard.

79
00:03:44,276 --> 00:03:46,076
This is ohio.
We have weather.

80
00:03:46,077 --> 00:03:48,512
You don't have to tell me about
underfunding for the arts.

81
00:03:48,513 --> 00:03:51,549
Look, all I know is
that our choir seems to be

82
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,318
The only thing that keeps
my girls from recidivism.

83
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,253
It makes them feel good
about themselves.

84
00:03:56,254 --> 00:03:58,889
I'm not going to cheat
and risk that just so
we can get a leg up

85
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,524
On your school
of privileged misfits.

86
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:03,027
Especially from what I hear.

87
00:04:03,028 --> 00:04:04,495
We're probably
going to take you anyway.

88
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:06,797
Really? And who'd
you hear that from?

89
00:04:06,798 --> 00:04:08,399
I had my spies
at your invitational.

90
00:04:09,835 --> 00:04:11,168
Want some coffee?

91
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:13,704
Please.

92
00:04:13,705 --> 00:04:16,173
I'm, I'm really sorry.

93
00:04:16,174 --> 00:04:18,976
I didn't mean
to offend you.

94
00:04:18,977 --> 00:04:21,278
Let me make it up to you.

95
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,281
You guys don't have
an auditorium, come use ours.

96
00:04:24,282 --> 00:04:26,283
Yeah, let's have a little, uh,
scrimmage at our place.

97
00:04:27,953 --> 00:04:30,120
Will:
Okay, guys, so first of all

98
00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:33,691
I want to welcome ms. Hitchens
and the jane addams glee club.

99
00:04:33,692 --> 00:04:35,593
We're all very happy
to have you guys here.

100
00:04:35,594 --> 00:04:37,862
So, um, we're going to let
you guys start us off.

101
00:04:37,863 --> 00:04:40,297
Let's see what you got.

102
00:04:40,298 --> 00:04:41,665
Hit it.

(indistinct overlapping chatter)

Mr. Shue, you
seem concerned.

153
00:07:00,238 --> 00:07:01,472
What? No.

154
00:07:01,473 --> 00:07:03,907
I mean, they were great,
but we're just as good.

155
00:07:03,908 --> 00:07:05,576
Mr. Shue, if I may.

156
00:07:05,577 --> 00:07:07,845
What they were doing was
just all smoke and mirrors.

157
00:07:07,846 --> 00:07:09,413
It's called "hairography."

158
00:07:09,414 --> 00:07:11,348
What?
Hairography.

159
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:13,517
All the whizzing of
their hair around

160
00:07:13,518 --> 00:07:15,986
Just to distract from
the fact that they're
not really good dancers.

161
00:07:15,987 --> 00:07:18,055
And their vocals
were just so-so.

162
00:07:18,056 --> 00:07:19,757
Trust me.

163
00:07:19,758 --> 00:07:21,592
We've nothing
to be afraid of.

164
00:07:26,097 --> 00:07:27,331
(school bell ringing)

165
00:07:29,267 --> 00:07:30,467
All right, guys.

166
00:07:30,468 --> 00:07:32,069
I did some thinking
last night.

167
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:35,205
I think I found our new number
for sectionals.

168
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:38,042
<i>We're going to do
the title song from hair.</i>

169
00:07:38,043 --> 00:07:40,044
Now, this show
started a revolution.

170
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:41,812
Wait, did they have
mohawks back then?

171
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:43,213
Like in the 20's
or whatever?

172
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:44,815
Yeah, mr. Shue,
if we're going to do

173
00:07:44,816 --> 00:07:46,150
A song about hair,

174
00:07:46,151 --> 00:07:47,151
Shouldn't we have more hair?

175
00:07:47,152 --> 00:07:48,252
One step ahead of you.

176
00:07:48,253 --> 00:07:50,687
Here are your wigs.

177
00:07:51,723 --> 00:07:53,190
Mr. Schuester?
Yeah?

178
00:07:53,191 --> 00:07:54,691
What are you doing?

179
00:07:54,692 --> 00:07:56,360
We are fine where we are.

180
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:57,428
We don't need
hairography.

181
00:07:57,429 --> 00:07:58,529
It's just a distraction.

182
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,064
Look, I have to be honest.

183
00:08:00,065 --> 00:08:02,199
Those jane addams girls
did freak me out a little.

184
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,935
And I'm worried
about our chances
for sectionals.

185
00:08:04,936 --> 00:08:07,738
I mean, we have to pull out all
the stops if we want to win.

186
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:11,208
(laughing)

187
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:13,243
Looking great, guys!

188
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:14,578
(will laughs)

189
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:16,413
Puck:
Saw it in a bookstore.

190
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:17,981
Figured I'd steal
it for you.

191
00:08:17,982 --> 00:08:19,650
You know, in case
you change your mind

192
00:08:19,651 --> 00:08:21,385
And decide you
want to keep it.

193
00:08:21,386 --> 00:08:23,387
That is so sweet.

194
00:08:24,556 --> 00:08:25,923
To be honest,

195
00:08:25,924 --> 00:08:27,791
I really don't know
what I'm going to do

196
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:29,193
About it anymore.

197
00:08:29,194 --> 00:08:31,295
My mind's pretty messed up
about everything.

198
00:08:31,296 --> 00:08:32,429
Well, whatever you decide.

199
00:08:33,598 --> 00:08:34,965
No pressure.

200
00:08:34,966 --> 00:08:36,767
Okay.

201
00:08:36,768 --> 00:08:38,168
<i>Quinn:
Thank god for puck.</i>

202
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:40,471
<i>Thanks to him,
I'm starting to realize</i>

203
00:08:40,472 --> 00:08:43,640
<i>That what I need right now,
even more than looser pants,</i>

204
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:45,142
<i>Is acceptance.</i>

205
00:08:45,143 --> 00:08:48,645
<i>Everyone is putting
so much pressure on me.</i>

206
00:08:48,646 --> 00:08:50,881
<i>It's so easy for them
to be distracted.</i>

207
00:08:50,882 --> 00:08:53,016
<i>I don't have that luxury.</i>

208
00:08:53,017 --> 00:08:54,485
<i>I am under siege.</i>

209
00:08:54,486 --> 00:08:56,153
You don't drink
diet soda, do you?

210
00:08:56,154 --> 00:08:58,388
Because the phosphoric acid
causes male pattern baldness.

211
00:08:58,389 --> 00:08:59,389
The baby's a girl.

212
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,358
Women go bald, too.

213
00:09:01,359 --> 00:09:02,593
You worry too much, terri.

214
00:09:02,594 --> 00:09:04,094
Mom smoked and drank

215
00:09:04,095 --> 00:09:05,429
A bottle of riuniti on ice

216
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,964
Every night when she
was pregnant with us

217
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:08,298
And we're totally normal.

218
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:09,833
Just take
your vitamins,

219
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:10,901
Stay out
of the hot tub,

220
00:09:10,902 --> 00:09:12,469
And avoid rum-based drinks,

221
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,171
And you'll be fine.

222
00:09:14,172 --> 00:09:18,008
<i>Maybe the problem isn't that I
don't want to keep the baby.</i>

223
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:19,543
<i>The problem is that</i>

224
00:09:19,544 --> 00:09:21,445
<i>I don't want to keep
the baby with finn.</i>

225
00:09:22,914 --> 00:09:24,915
<i>Maybe I didn't give puck
enough of a chance.</i>

226
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:27,751
<i>He is the real dad, after all.</i>

227
00:09:27,752 --> 00:09:31,121
<i>Finn would freak if I started
spending time with puck though.</i>

228
00:09:31,122 --> 00:09:34,358
<i>I need to distract him
so that I can take puck</i>

229
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:35,626
<i>For a test drive.</i>

230
00:09:35,627 --> 00:09:36,793
<i>But how?</i>

231
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:39,196
<i>Mm, forget about it.</i>

232
00:09:39,197 --> 00:09:41,932
<i>She looks like a five year old.</i>

233
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:44,835
<i>Still, maybe
with a little bit of makeup...</i>

234
00:09:46,137 --> 00:09:48,805
Hey, kurt, can I pick your
pink brain for a second?

235
00:09:48,806 --> 00:09:50,007
Why hello, quinn.

236
00:09:50,008 --> 00:09:51,508
To what do I
owe the honor?

237
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:54,378
I do believe this
is the first time
you've ever spoken to me.

238
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:55,946
I'm sorry about that.

239
00:09:55,947 --> 00:09:58,382
Anyways, I have a
proposition to make:

240
00:09:58,383 --> 00:09:59,883
A makeover.
I'm in!

241
00:09:59,884 --> 00:10:01,652
Makeovers are like
crack to me.
Uh-huh.

242
00:10:01,653 --> 00:10:03,487
My suggestion... Spanx.

243
00:10:03,488 --> 00:10:05,222
Or a double-knit camisole

244
00:10:05,223 --> 00:10:06,957
With a control top
for the baby bump.

245
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,227
Also, babydoll dresses--
dead giveaway.

246
00:10:10,228 --> 00:10:12,429
Not for me, for rachel.

247
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,131
Why would I want to do that?

248
00:10:14,132 --> 00:10:15,566
I admit I like

249
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:17,134
A challenge as much
as the next guy,

250
00:10:17,135 --> 00:10:19,536
But rachel somehow
manages to dress

251
00:10:19,537 --> 00:10:22,072
Like a grandmother and a toddler
at the same time.

252
00:10:22,073 --> 00:10:24,241
My point exactly.

253
00:10:24,242 --> 00:10:26,610
You're as concerned
about the glee club succeeding

254
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:28,045
As I am, and she's
a distraction.

255
00:10:28,046 --> 00:10:30,647
Look at her.
She's wearing a pantsuit.

256
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,350
Don't you think

257
00:10:33,351 --> 00:10:35,052
The judges are going
to take one look at her

258
00:10:35,053 --> 00:10:38,488
And maybe want to knock
her down a peg or two?

259
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:41,058
And to think... I thought you
were a dumb blonde.

260
00:10:42,026 --> 00:10:43,393
Deal.

261
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:51,033
Good night.
Good night.

262
00:11:03,846 --> 00:11:05,247
(gasping)

263
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,249
What are you doing?!
I'm trying to be intimate

264
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,017
With my wife.
No, you're trying to have sex.

265
00:11:09,018 --> 00:11:11,220
Wh...
Not intimacy.

266
00:11:11,221 --> 00:11:14,156
If you wanted intimacy, you...

267
00:11:14,157 --> 00:11:16,758
You would ask me how I'm feeling
about being pregnant.

268
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,960
You're right.

269
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:20,662
I'm sorry.

270
00:11:20,663 --> 00:11:21,763
Okay.

271
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,606
It will all be worth it
when she shows up, right?

272
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:34,409
Yeah. Of course.

273
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,878
Love you.
Love you.

274
00:11:41,985 --> 00:11:44,753
<i>Terri:
There's no way I can
keep this up.</i>

275
00:11:44,754 --> 00:11:46,788
<i>He's gonna catch on.</i>

276
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:50,759
<i>I miss him, too, though.</i>

277
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,761
<i>I do want to have
a family with him.</i>

278
00:11:52,762 --> 00:11:54,730
<i>I only ever started
lying about all of this</i>

279
00:11:54,731 --> 00:11:56,798
<i>To give us a chance.</i>

280
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,168
<i>I just need to buy
myself some more time.</i>

281
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:02,738
<i>I've got to distract
him with something.</i>

282
00:12:02,739 --> 00:12:04,806
<i>But what?</i>

283
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,348
Ow.

284
00:12:13,349 --> 00:12:16,318
The key is to never wax
above the eyebrow.

285
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,419
Always shape from below.

286
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,888
Trust me, I get
a lot of practice.

287
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:21,390
Look at mine.

288
00:12:21,391 --> 00:12:27,329
Kurt, why did you volunteer
to give me a new look?

289
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,698
One, I'm a sucker
for makeovers,

290
00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:32,367
And two, you need something
to distract from your
horrible personality.

291
00:12:32,368 --> 00:12:35,937
Most of the time, I find
it hard to be in the
same room with you.

292
00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:37,706
Especially this one.

293
00:12:37,707 --> 00:12:39,274
Which looks like where

294
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:41,276
Strawberry shortcake and
holly hobbie come to hook up.

295
00:12:44,714 --> 00:12:47,416
You're extremely
talented, rachel.

296
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:50,352
Watching you perform
is... Amazing.

297
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,454
But sometimes it's hard
to appreciate

298
00:12:52,455 --> 00:12:54,856
What a good singer you are
because all I'm thinking about

299
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,658
Is shoving a sock
into your mouth.

300
00:12:56,659 --> 00:13:00,228
Well, what kind of makeover
did you have in mind?

301
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:03,799
We need to broaden
your appeal.

302
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,902
I want every boy at school
to do a double take
when you strut past.

303
00:13:06,903 --> 00:13:10,272
There's really only just...

304
00:13:10,273 --> 00:13:12,941
One boy that I'd
like to impress.

305
00:13:12,942 --> 00:13:14,576
Can you keep
a secret?

306
00:13:14,577 --> 00:13:15,744
Of course.

307
00:13:15,745 --> 00:13:18,347
I'm in love with finn.

308
00:13:18,348 --> 00:13:19,748
Really?

309
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:23,685
I understand completely.

310
00:13:23,686 --> 00:13:25,354
Let's move on to makeup.

311
00:13:25,355 --> 00:13:27,122
I happen to know
for a fact

312
00:13:27,123 --> 00:13:28,857
That finn is attracted
to loose women.

313
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:32,294
What? Quinn is so wholesome.

314
00:13:32,295 --> 00:13:35,397
Let me put this into
musical theater parlance.

315
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,799
<i>In grease, what did sandy
do to get danny zuko?</i>

316
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,301
She had to ditch
the poodle skirt

317
00:13:39,302 --> 00:13:41,136
And slap on a cat suit.

318
00:13:41,137 --> 00:13:44,072
In short, she had
to dress like a ho.

319
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,708
Maybe if your
look was better,

320
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:52,414
More desirable, finn would be
in your arms right now.

321
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,750
Instead of quinn's.

322
00:13:58,621 --> 00:14:00,055
What's going on, terr?

323
00:14:00,056 --> 00:14:01,990
Just a couple more
steps, okay?

324
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:03,925
All right, stop.

325
00:14:08,798 --> 00:14:10,499
Will:
Is that the blue bomber?

326
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,868
It is!

327
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:15,137
I remember I took you
to prom in this car.

328
00:14:15,138 --> 00:14:16,838
We did it in
the backseat.

329
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:18,673
Well, this isn't
actually your old car.

330
00:14:18,674 --> 00:14:20,142
I found this one
on ebay.

331
00:14:20,143 --> 00:14:22,477
You know, I always
regretted selling this car.

332
00:14:22,478 --> 00:14:24,880
I know. That's why
I got you this one.

333
00:14:24,881 --> 00:14:27,449
I thought maybe working
on it would be a--

334
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,751
A distraction from all
the pressure that
you've been under.

335
00:14:29,752 --> 00:14:31,653
You are the best.

336
00:14:35,158 --> 00:14:37,959
Honey.
Yeah?

337
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,395
Um, could you go and
get me a frozen yogurt?

338
00:14:40,396 --> 00:14:41,563
Yeah, sure.

339
00:14:41,564 --> 00:14:43,098
Oh, maybe I'll stop
by pep boys.

340
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:45,300
Maybe they have
some advice.

341
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,401
That's a good idea.

342
00:14:46,402 --> 00:14:48,170
Yeah.
Take your time,
honey.

343
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:49,604
How could you
bring her here?

344
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:50,906
What if he saw her?

345
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:52,307
You're gonna want
to hear this.

346
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,009
I gave little miss peroxide
my phone number

347
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,076
In case of an emergency,

348
00:14:55,077 --> 00:14:57,012
And she called
to drop the bomb on me.

349
00:14:57,013 --> 00:14:58,380
What? What bomb?

350
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:03,218
What is it?

351
00:15:03,219 --> 00:15:05,086
I'm keeping my baby.

352
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,824
(bell ringing)

353
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:12,360
Look, we had no intention
of discriminating

354
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:14,196
Against your glee
club, mr. Rumba.

355
00:15:14,197 --> 00:15:17,098
We extended an invitation
to the jane addams academy

356
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:19,201
To perform,
because we're lucky enough

357
00:15:19,202 --> 00:15:20,869
To have better
facilities than they do.

358
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,472
And you think we don't have
the same problem?

359
00:15:23,473 --> 00:15:26,374
I run the glee club
at a school for the deaf.

360
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,944
(phone ringing)
you think I'm rolling around
in deaf choir money?

361
00:15:28,945 --> 00:15:31,480
Now sure, my kids
may be deaf,

362
00:15:31,481 --> 00:15:33,415
But that shouldn't distract
everyone from the fact

363
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,883
That they still have

364
00:15:34,884 --> 00:15:36,785
A song in their heart,
and they should have

365
00:15:36,786 --> 00:15:38,620
The same chance as
everyone else to express it.

366
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:40,155
Now I had scarlet fever
as a kid,

367
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:41,723
(ringing continues)
leaving me deaf in one ear.

368
00:15:41,724 --> 00:15:43,758
So I remember what it's like
to have full hearing,

369
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,527
But my poor kids
don't know the difference.

370
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:49,064
(ringing continues)
all they know is that
they love performing.

371
00:15:49,065 --> 00:15:51,700
And then they have to hear
that mckinley went and invited

372
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,635
Those bad girls to the school.

373
00:15:53,636 --> 00:15:55,570
(ringing continues)
that's just not fair.
It's not fair.

374
00:15:55,571 --> 00:15:57,339
I think your phone's ringing.
What?

375
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,907
Your phone's ringing.
No, I got it on vibrate.

376
00:15:58,908 --> 00:16:00,542
All I am saying is

377
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:01,776
That it would be nice

378
00:16:01,777 --> 00:16:03,612
If you went and hosted
another scrimmage

379
00:16:03,613 --> 00:16:05,580
And had the courtesy
to invite us this time.

380
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:07,082
I couldn't agree more.

381
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,016
What's that?

382
00:16:08,017 --> 00:16:09,684
I said I agree with you.

383
00:16:09,685 --> 00:16:11,353
Okay, I can't hear you.

384
00:16:11,354 --> 00:16:13,388
Talk into this ear.
Scarlet fever.

385
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,357
I'm sorry...
(loudly): You're on!

386
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:16,391
Um, how's Monday?

387
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,126
No, it has to be Monday.

388
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:19,728
Yes! All right!

389
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,263
Monday!

390
00:16:21,264 --> 00:16:24,699
I can't wait to see the kids
do their numbers!

391
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,302
You don't have to make fun of me
with those hand gestures.

392
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:28,570
No, I didn't...

393
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,305
(loudly):
I didn't mean to.

394
00:16:30,306 --> 00:16:32,541
Let me check with my secretary.

395
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:34,109
Oh, damn, four missed calls.

396
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,545
What's that?

397
00:16:36,546 --> 00:16:38,179
I didn't say anything.

398
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:42,250
Yes, thank you.
I take it black, two sugars.

399
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,752
Hello.

400
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,086
Hello?!

401
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,098
I can't do this anymore.

402
00:16:48,099 --> 00:16:49,533
It's time to tell him.

403
00:16:49,534 --> 00:16:51,134
Will:
Terri?
Yeah, honey?

404
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,702
Oh, hey, kendra.

405
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,738
Damn, will.

406
00:16:54,739 --> 00:16:57,374
You make one sexy grease monkey.

407
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,376
I am having so much fun.

408
00:16:59,377 --> 00:17:00,577
Working with my hands,

409
00:17:00,578 --> 00:17:02,212
Searching for parts
all over town.

410
00:17:02,213 --> 00:17:04,314
I feel like I'm
in a springsteen song.

411
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,650
Well, I got to get
some old dish towels--

412
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,018
Mop up the grime.

413
00:17:11,956 --> 00:17:14,857
That car is
the perfect distraction.

414
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:16,392
I would get something
like that for phil

415
00:17:16,393 --> 00:17:18,394
If I didn't think it
would make him so happy.

416
00:17:18,395 --> 00:17:19,729
What's the difference?

417
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,064
He's going to get pretty
damn suspicious

418
00:17:21,065 --> 00:17:23,132
When I come home from
the hospital without a baby.

419
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:24,801
You need to relax.

420
00:17:25,903 --> 00:17:27,737
And drink more.

421
00:17:27,738 --> 00:17:30,373
I have got this
whole thing figured out.

422
00:17:30,374 --> 00:17:32,575
You do?
Mm-hmm.

423
00:17:32,576 --> 00:17:35,178
Blondie's due date is right
around spring break.

424
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,879
You and I

425
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,383
Are going to have a lady's
week at a spa down in cincci

426
00:17:40,384 --> 00:17:42,585
That caters to
the prenatal set.

427
00:17:42,586 --> 00:17:45,221
But, in reality,
we're gonna be camped out

428
00:17:45,222 --> 00:17:48,858
At wu's office with quinn until
that high school hussy drops.

429
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,894
That's a great plan.

430
00:17:51,895 --> 00:17:55,031
Except for the fact that quinn
won't give us her baby anymore.

431
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:58,201
But she will, dummy.

432
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:01,204
We have to distract her with
the reality of her situation.

433
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,606
How are we going to do that?

434
00:18:03,607 --> 00:18:05,308
She needs money.

435
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:08,478
I'm going to have her
babysit my kids.

436
00:18:08,479 --> 00:18:10,113
Five minutes alone with
those little mongrels

437
00:18:10,114 --> 00:18:11,814
And she'll have her tubes tied.

438
00:18:11,815 --> 00:18:14,350
You're so smart.

439
00:18:14,351 --> 00:18:17,420
You got the beauty, but I got
the brains and the beauty.

440
00:18:17,421 --> 00:18:18,721
(laughing)
(bell ringing)

441
00:18:26,664 --> 00:18:29,065
Hey, rachel.

442
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,967
Oh, hey, finn.

443
00:18:30,968 --> 00:18:32,602
I didn't see you there.

444
00:18:32,603 --> 00:18:34,203
Did you want
to ask me something?

445
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,875
Uh, yeah, I-I just, I forgot.

446
00:18:38,876 --> 00:18:40,343
I got distracted.

447
00:18:40,344 --> 00:18:41,878
Well, I'm glad
I got your attention.

448
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:44,447
I wanted to know if you
wanted to come over
on Friday night.

449
00:18:44,448 --> 00:18:45,815
As someone who's had
long, luxurious locks

450
00:18:45,816 --> 00:18:48,084
Since I was a toddler
in the pageant circuit,

451
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,419
I figured
I could give you

452
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,987
<i>Some tips on our hair number.</i>

453
00:18:50,988 --> 00:18:53,156
Yeah, that'd be great.

454
00:18:53,157 --> 00:18:55,591
Great. How's 8:00?

455
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,728
8:00 is terrific.
It's terrific.

456
00:19:01,732 --> 00:19:03,733
Objective achieved.

457
00:19:03,734 --> 00:19:06,169
Commence phase two.

458
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,570
Hey, quinn.

459
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,274
I, uh, wanted to ask
your permission

460
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,377
To maybe do something
on Friday night, if...

461
00:19:14,378 --> 00:19:15,712
Oh, that's fine.

462
00:19:15,713 --> 00:19:18,314
I'm babysitting anyways.

463
00:19:18,315 --> 00:19:19,949
Oh, cool.

464
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,184
I'll see ya.

465
00:19:24,421 --> 00:19:26,389
Hey,

466
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,924
What are you doing
on Friday?

467
00:19:27,925 --> 00:19:29,459
Just the usual.

468
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,361
Was going to stand outside
the 7-eleven looking depressed

469
00:19:31,362 --> 00:19:32,829
Until someone offered
to buy me beer,

470
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,996
But what's going on?

471
00:19:33,997 --> 00:19:36,265
You want to maybe
babysit with me?

472
00:19:38,836 --> 00:19:40,370
(bell ringing)

473
00:19:40,371 --> 00:19:42,538
Some of you,
particularly the guys,

474
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:45,341
Have come up to me
with some questions
about hairography.

475
00:19:45,342 --> 00:19:47,710
One of our own has volunteered
to walk us through it.

476
00:19:47,711 --> 00:19:48,845
She has got it down.

477
00:19:48,846 --> 00:19:50,980
Brittany,
take it away.

478
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,549
Take what away?

479
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,318
Show us what you got.

480
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,153
Oh.
All right.

481
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,921
So, hairography.

482
00:19:58,922 --> 00:20:00,990
It works best when you pretend
like you're getting tasered.

483
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,325
So you just move
your head around

484
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,495
Like you're spazzing and stuff.

485
00:20:10,067 --> 00:20:11,334
Very nice.
Wow.

486
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,606
You guys, it's like
cool epilepsy.

487
00:20:16,607 --> 00:20:18,207
Will:
Come on, guys.

488
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,243
Let's see
what you got.

489
00:20:20,244 --> 00:20:21,511
Good, guys, yeah.

490
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:24,013
Just relax and go for it,
all right.

491
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:32,755
My neck, my back.

492
00:20:32,756 --> 00:20:34,123
(laughter)

493
00:20:34,124 --> 00:20:36,359
When is the lying
going to stop, sue?

494
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,894
I don't know what
you're talking about.

495
00:20:37,895 --> 00:20:40,296
You've been spying on me
and we both know it.

496
00:20:40,297 --> 00:20:41,931
You'll do anything
to torpedo glee club.

497
00:20:41,932 --> 00:20:43,466
And it has got to stop!

498
00:20:43,467 --> 00:20:45,601
Sue:
I resent that
accusation, william.

499
00:20:45,602 --> 00:20:47,370
And one I understand you've
been making to our friends

500
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,371
At haverbrook and jane addams.

501
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,972
And it's an outrageous

502
00:20:49,973 --> 00:20:52,575
Affront to my
sterling reputation!

503
00:20:52,576 --> 00:20:53,876
That being said,

504
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,812
Fine, I have been
checking up on you.

505
00:20:55,813 --> 00:20:57,947
Because I don't like
what's going on in there.

506
00:20:57,948 --> 00:21:00,349
Do you know why I make
each of my cheerios

507
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,752
Wear her hair pulled
back in a ponytail?

508
00:21:02,753 --> 00:21:05,121
Because I don't want to distract
from her impeccable talent.

509
00:21:05,122 --> 00:21:08,458
You seem to be taking
the opposite approach, will.

510
00:21:08,459 --> 00:21:10,827
And that leads me to believe
you know your kids

511
00:21:10,828 --> 00:21:12,261
Don't have what it takes.

512
00:21:12,262 --> 00:21:13,963
I believe in my kids.

513
00:21:13,964 --> 00:21:15,932
Well, maybe in the
beginning, but not now.

514
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:17,467
Now that you've seen
the competition

515
00:21:17,468 --> 00:21:21,103
That threatens your
very position at this school!

516
00:21:21,104 --> 00:21:24,173
You're going to get me
an updated set list
by 5:00 tomorrow.

517
00:21:24,174 --> 00:21:26,142
And if there's anything
on that list

518
00:21:26,143 --> 00:21:29,445
That involved, demeaning,
fruity hair tossing,
I'm cutting it!

519
00:21:29,446 --> 00:21:33,416
I will not let you dictate
my number choices.

520
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,985
And you are not
getting that list.

521
00:21:35,986 --> 00:21:37,653
Well, then I'm back
as co-director.

522
00:21:41,158 --> 00:21:42,458
(sighs)

523
00:21:44,828 --> 00:21:47,129
Okay, guys, from the top.

524
00:21:48,444 --> 00:21:50,645
I'll just be a second.

525
00:21:50,646 --> 00:21:52,847
Thanks again for helping me out
with this hairography stuff.

526
00:21:52,848 --> 00:21:53,981
Yeah, I mean,

527
00:21:53,982 --> 00:21:55,983
You know, it's all
about getting warmed up.

528
00:21:55,984 --> 00:21:56,884
Could you think of a song,

529
00:21:56,885 --> 00:21:58,453
Maybe, that we could
practice with?

530
00:21:58,454 --> 00:22:00,822
<i>What about the, the one
from grease?</i>

531
00:22:00,823 --> 00:22:02,023
You know, we did it

532
00:22:02,024 --> 00:22:03,324
When you first
joined the club?

533
00:22:04,325 --> 00:22:07,060
Okay, only I was just mostly

534
00:22:07,061 --> 00:22:11,398
Nervous that day,
but it...

535
00:22:11,399 --> 00:22:13,834
(sultry):
Tell me about it... Stud.

536
00:22:15,236 --> 00:22:16,703

What's wrong?

546
00:22:47,735 --> 00:22:49,202
I need to be honest with you.

547
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:51,204
I'm-I'm really uncomfortable
right now.

548
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:53,573
I'm gonna say this as nicely
as I possibly can,

549
00:22:53,574 --> 00:22:55,041
But you look like

550
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:56,843
A sad clown hooker.

551
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,180
What?

552
00:23:00,181 --> 00:23:01,248
This look,

553
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:03,683
It just isn't you.

554
00:23:03,684 --> 00:23:05,285
I mean, maybe
when I first saw it,

555
00:23:05,286 --> 00:23:07,254
I was caught off guard
that you looked all

556
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:08,822
Adult and stuff,

557
00:23:08,823 --> 00:23:11,625
But it's not what's really great
about you, rachel.

558
00:23:11,626 --> 00:23:13,527
I actually
like the way

559
00:23:13,528 --> 00:23:16,696
You usually dress,
sequined leg warmers and stuff.

560
00:23:16,697 --> 00:23:20,634
I thought this was
what you liked.

561
00:23:20,635 --> 00:23:25,438
No, not at all.

562
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:27,607
Funny, I was just having
this conversation

563
00:23:27,608 --> 00:23:29,743
Last week with kurt,
and he asked me...

564
00:23:29,744 --> 00:23:31,611
So what kind
of girls do you like?

565
00:23:31,612 --> 00:23:32,946
Oh, uh, I like it

566
00:23:32,947 --> 00:23:35,148
When they're
natural and stuff;

567
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:37,584
Not a lot of makeup,
not skintight clothes.

568
00:23:37,585 --> 00:23:38,919
That sort of thing,
you know?

569
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,954
Totally.

570
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,991
I feel like an idiot.

571
00:23:44,992 --> 00:23:47,160
No, no, this is my fault.

572
00:23:47,161 --> 00:23:50,730
It isn't right for me
to be here anyway.

573
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:55,302
But I really like you, rachel.

574
00:23:58,272 --> 00:23:59,472
I gotta go.

575
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,514
(kids yelling)

576
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:09,449
I told you we should
have been the cowboys.

577
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,251
My bad.

578
00:24:11,252 --> 00:24:13,253
What are we gonna
do about this?

579
00:24:14,989 --> 00:24:16,489
Who are you texting?!

580
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,359
Uh, mike ching.
He's got wind problems.

581
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,228
Well, put the phone down
and help me

582
00:24:21,229 --> 00:24:24,531
With this knot.
I've almost got it.

583
00:24:24,532 --> 00:24:27,534
(yelling continues)

584
00:24:27,535 --> 00:24:28,602
(grunts)

585
00:24:28,603 --> 00:24:30,904
Stop that!
Not the table!

586
00:24:32,707 --> 00:24:33,840
Think of something!

587
00:24:33,841 --> 00:24:34,875
I brought my guitar.

588
00:24:34,876 --> 00:24:36,476
Why don't we sing them
a lullaby?

589
00:24:36,477 --> 00:24:38,178
Give me this.
Hey, kids, look at me.

590
00:24:39,814 --> 00:24:42,983
Want to see

Sing it again.

607
00:26:02,997 --> 00:26:04,664
I think this is
the first time

608
00:26:04,665 --> 00:26:07,500
They have all been asleep
at the same time.

609
00:26:09,437 --> 00:26:11,371
What's that smell?

610
00:26:11,372 --> 00:26:12,372
Soap.

611
00:26:12,373 --> 00:26:14,808
You got them
to take a bath?

612
00:26:16,477 --> 00:26:18,378
What are you,
an exorcist?

613
00:26:21,082 --> 00:26:22,415
She's like a jet, right?

614
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:26,286
I need a new clutch and
a new set of shocks, but she is

615
00:26:26,287 --> 00:26:27,554
Really coming together.

616
00:26:27,555 --> 00:26:29,622
What are you gonna do
when the kid comes?

617
00:26:29,623 --> 00:26:32,425
You can't put a car seat
in that thing.

618
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:33,927
No latch system.

619
00:26:33,928 --> 00:26:36,896
Puck:
You were awesome tonight.

620
00:26:36,897 --> 00:26:40,867
I was surprised at
how I kinda enjoyed it.

621
00:26:40,868 --> 00:26:43,403
I was worried
about you at first.

622
00:26:43,404 --> 00:26:46,473
You seemed distracted,
all that texting to mike.

623
00:26:46,474 --> 00:26:50,043
Distracted? I was
the opposite, babe.

624
00:26:50,044 --> 00:26:51,311
I was totally into it.

625
00:26:51,312 --> 00:26:52,879
All I know is we proved
something tonight:

626
00:26:54,148 --> 00:26:57,450
This parenting thing?
We can do this.

627
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:03,757
You set me up...
With finn!

628
00:27:03,758 --> 00:27:06,092
Looks like someone is running
for drama queen again.

629
00:27:06,093 --> 00:27:07,327
How could you do that?

630
00:27:07,328 --> 00:27:08,995
I thought we were friends.

631
00:27:08,996 --> 00:27:10,597
And what made you think that?

632
00:27:11,832 --> 00:27:13,333
You should be thanking me.

633
00:27:13,334 --> 00:27:15,802
All I did was help you realize
that your schoolgirl fantasy

634
00:27:15,803 --> 00:27:18,004
Of running off with finn
was nothing but a fairytale.

635
00:27:18,005 --> 00:27:20,073
You like him.

636
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,243
Yeah, that's,
that's what this is.

637
00:27:23,244 --> 00:27:25,311
And you were just trying
to eliminate the competition.

638
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:29,182
I was just helping him
understand

639
00:27:29,183 --> 00:27:30,917
<i>That you are not
a viable second choice.</i>

640
00:27:30,918 --> 00:27:35,255
You think I'm a second choice?

641
00:27:35,256 --> 00:27:37,624
A distant second.

642
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:39,259
You think I'm living
in a fairytale?

643
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,428
If I were second
or if I were 50th,

644
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:43,596
I'd still be ahead of you
because I'm a girl.

645
00:27:46,067 --> 00:27:48,735
Okay, here's the dope,
princess:

646
00:27:48,736 --> 00:27:51,071
There's no hope
for either of us.

647
00:27:51,072 --> 00:27:54,774
He loves quinn.
They're having a baby together.

648
00:27:54,775 --> 00:27:57,343
We're nothing but distractions.

649
00:27:58,646 --> 00:28:02,682
The sooner we realize that...
The better.

650
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:06,886
(school bell ringing)

651
00:28:06,887 --> 00:28:10,690
Keep your paws off my man.

652
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:13,693
Clear? (scoffs)

653
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:14,727
Who's your man?

654
00:28:14,728 --> 00:28:16,396
Don't play stupid, tubbers.

655
00:28:16,397 --> 00:28:18,565
Oh, and for the record,

656
00:28:18,566 --> 00:28:22,335
Asking someone to babysit
with you is super '90s.

657
00:28:22,336 --> 00:28:26,005
I happen to know
that puck cares about me.

658
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:27,474
Oh, wake up!

659
00:28:27,475 --> 00:28:30,243
While you two were babysitting,
puck and I were sexting.

660
00:28:30,244 --> 00:28:32,078
Sexting?

661
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:35,281
Sexy texting. Seriously,
what era are you from?

662
00:28:35,282 --> 00:28:36,549
While you two were

663
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,017
"playing house,"

664
00:28:38,018 --> 00:28:41,588
Puck and I were trading
super-hot texts.

665
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:44,023
Why don't you check
his cell phone?

666
00:28:44,024 --> 00:28:47,093
'cause my sexts are
too hot to erase.

667
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:55,176
<i>Thank you all for coming.</i>

668
00:28:55,177 --> 00:28:57,378
We are so honored
to have you guys here.

669
00:28:57,379 --> 00:29:02,216
So, without further ado,
I present the new directions.

670
00:29:05,087 --> 00:29:06,187
(upbeat r&b playing)

671
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:10,491
Yes, so crazy right now.

672
00:29:10,492 --> 00:29:14,796

It's you're girl mercedes.

674

Um...

747
00:34:23,758 --> 00:34:25,225
You really
don't want to do that.

748
00:34:28,563 --> 00:34:29,630
You lied to me.

749
00:34:29,631 --> 00:34:31,298
I'm sorry.

750
00:34:31,299 --> 00:34:32,566
I tried to resist santana.

751
00:34:32,567 --> 00:34:33,867
I did.

752
00:34:33,868 --> 00:34:37,504
But I'm young and girls
have this power over me.

753
00:34:37,505 --> 00:34:38,739
But, hey, it's all good.

754
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,641
It's definitely
not all good.

755
00:34:40,642 --> 00:34:41,842
I thought you wanted
to be with me.

756
00:34:41,843 --> 00:34:44,745
I do. Like, a lot.

757
00:34:44,746 --> 00:34:46,046
But you haven't
given it up to me

758
00:34:46,047 --> 00:34:47,181
Since the night
I knocked you up,

759
00:34:47,182 --> 00:34:48,949
And, baby, I'm a dude.

760
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:50,184
I have needs.

761
00:34:50,185 --> 00:34:52,186
So, you expect to
raise a baby with me

762
00:34:52,187 --> 00:34:55,556
And text dirty messages to
every other girl at this school

763
00:34:55,557 --> 00:34:57,591
If I don't give it
up to you every day?

764
00:34:57,592 --> 00:35:00,260
No. Just the hot girls.

765
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,465
Look, I'm going
to be a good dad,

766
00:35:04,466 --> 00:35:06,400
But I'm not going
to stop being me to do it.

767
00:35:09,704 --> 00:35:10,871
<i>Quinn:
You can have her.</i>

768
00:35:10,872 --> 00:35:13,007
Are you serious?

769
00:35:13,008 --> 00:35:15,309
A girl really needs
a good father.

770
00:35:16,811 --> 00:35:18,679
And the only way
she's going to get that

771
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,913
Is if I give her to you.

772
00:35:21,383 --> 00:35:24,418
You think mr. Shue's going
to be a good father, don't you?

773
00:35:27,088 --> 00:35:28,589
Yeah.

774
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:31,258
I think he's going
to be an amazing dad.

775
00:35:33,061 --> 00:35:35,896
Will!
Hey, guys.

776
00:35:35,897 --> 00:35:37,731
I thought you were going to be
at the scrap yard all afternoon.

777
00:35:37,732 --> 00:35:40,134
Oh, yeah,
uh, change of plans.

778
00:35:40,135 --> 00:35:42,002
Got distracted
with something else.

779
00:35:42,003 --> 00:35:44,738
Uh, quinn,
what are you doing here?

780
00:35:44,739 --> 00:35:46,140
Oh, girl talk.

781
00:35:46,141 --> 00:35:48,509
We're exchanging
pregnancy war stories.

782
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:51,478
Oh, that's... Nice.

783
00:35:51,479 --> 00:35:52,680
Well, when you get a sec,

784
00:35:52,681 --> 00:35:54,281
Can you meet me
out in the garage, ter?

785
00:35:54,282 --> 00:35:58,085
Oh, I was
just leaving, so...

786
00:36:03,792 --> 00:36:04,992
Yes?

787
00:36:17,272 --> 00:36:18,772
Later, mr. Shue.

788
00:36:24,813 --> 00:36:26,447
(chuckles)

789
00:36:26,448 --> 00:36:28,215
<i>Terri:
You know I hate surprises.</i>

790
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:38,292
Where's the blue bomber ii?

791
00:36:38,293 --> 00:36:39,927
I sold it to some kid.

792
00:36:39,928 --> 00:36:41,128
For a tidy little profit.

793
00:36:41,129 --> 00:36:42,496
Let him have the fun.

794
00:36:42,497 --> 00:36:45,799
I made enough for a down payment
on a car for our whole family.

795
00:36:47,168 --> 00:36:49,203
Oh, terri.

796
00:36:50,338 --> 00:36:51,705
I love you.

797
00:36:52,841 --> 00:36:54,475
And our little girl.

798
00:36:54,476 --> 00:36:57,578
And I don't want anything
to distract me from you guys.

799
00:36:59,914 --> 00:37:02,249

800
00:37:04,586 --> 00:37:05,753

00:37:08,523 --> 00:37:11,325
Can we be in love again?

803
00:37:11,326 --> 00:37:13,827
I have to tell you
something first.

804
00:37:13,828 --> 00:37:15,662
I, uh...

805
00:37:15,663 --> 00:37:18,165
I want us to be honest with
each other, no matter what.

806
00:37:18,166 --> 00:37:20,934
You can tell me anything.

807
00:37:20,935 --> 00:37:23,003
Cool. Uh...

808
00:37:23,004 --> 00:37:25,339
It... It's not really
even that big a deal.

809
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,275
I mean, I didn't
actually do anything,

810
00:37:28,276 --> 00:37:31,178
But, the other night,
when you were babysitting...

811
00:37:32,814 --> 00:37:33,981
I kind of went over
to rachel's house.

812
00:37:35,517 --> 00:37:36,683
But nothing happened.

813
00:37:36,684 --> 00:37:39,653
I... Just was worked up
about us fighting

814
00:37:39,654 --> 00:37:42,956
And then she put on this
really weird catwoman suit,

815
00:37:42,957 --> 00:37:44,925
And so I think something
could have happened,

816
00:37:44,926 --> 00:37:46,493
But it didn't.

817
00:37:47,896 --> 00:37:50,164
Because I only want
to be with you.

818
00:37:51,666 --> 00:37:52,833
It's all right.

819
00:37:54,235 --> 00:37:56,804

So, we're a stool choir now?

847
00:39:30,798 --> 00:39:32,966
Nope. We're not dancing
with the stools.

848
00:39:32,967 --> 00:39:36,303
No gimmicks. No
false theatricality.

849
00:39:36,304 --> 00:39:38,739

00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,210
Thanks, mr. Schuester.

851
00:39:44,646 --> 00:39:48,749
This is their set
list from sectionals.

852
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,017

Performed in wheelchairs.
That's in.

855
00:39:53,521 --> 00:39:56,023
Now, I suggest you
take these two songs,

856
00:39:56,024 --> 00:39:58,325
Split them between
your two groups,

857
00:39:58,326 --> 00:39:59,893
And I'll pull some strings

858
00:39:59,894 --> 00:40:02,362
And make sure that schuester
and his group perform last.

859
00:40:02,363 --> 00:40:06,300
That way, it'll look
like he stole the songs

860
00:40:06,301 --> 00:40:07,601
From you.

861
00:40:07,602 --> 00:40:10,037
Um, who do you think I am?

862
00:40:10,038 --> 00:40:11,805
That's actually
a very good question

863
00:40:11,806 --> 00:40:13,507
Because I've forgotten
both of your names.

864
00:40:13,508 --> 00:40:16,944
Look, I spend
every waking hour of my day

865
00:40:16,945 --> 00:40:19,212
Trying to teach those girls
that lying and cheating

866
00:40:19,213 --> 00:40:21,315
Is not the way you're
ever going to get ahead.

867
00:40:21,316 --> 00:40:23,050
And you're suggesting
I do exactly that,

868
00:40:23,051 --> 00:40:24,952
So that they can win
a singing competition?

869
00:40:24,953 --> 00:40:26,453
Yeah, pretty much.

870
00:40:27,889 --> 00:40:29,056
(sighs)

871
00:40:29,057 --> 00:40:30,991
I think you're missing
an opportunity

872
00:40:30,992 --> 00:40:33,026
To give your girls
a second chance.

873
00:40:33,027 --> 00:40:35,162
These mckinley kids
are going to do fine.

874
00:40:35,163 --> 00:40:36,897
But outside of glee club,

875
00:40:36,898 --> 00:40:38,832
Your girls don't have a heck
of a lot going for them.

876
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:43,170
And I'd hate to see them
so devastated by losing

877
00:40:43,171 --> 00:40:44,805
That they'd
give up entirely.

878
00:40:44,806 --> 00:40:47,641
You know how many deaf choirs
have won this competition?

879
00:40:47,642 --> 00:40:50,210
Okay. Everybody's going
to need to speak up

880
00:40:50,211 --> 00:40:51,311
Because I can't hear.

881
00:40:51,312 --> 00:40:53,380
Deaf in one ear.
Scarlet fever.

882
00:40:53,381 --> 00:40:56,383
I assume you read
lips. Read these.

883
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:03,557
Never let anything
distract you from winning.

884
00:41:05,226 --> 00:41:07,461
Ever.
