Previously on <i>Smash...</i>

3
00:00:03,828 --> 00:00:04,995
I'm Marilyn.

4
00:00:04,996 --> 00:00:06,663
I think
she'd be a great musical.

5
00:00:06,664 --> 00:00:09,207
<i>Marilyn, the musical?</i>
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

6
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:11,918
We are in the middle
of an adoption.

7
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:14,379
I was working on
my audition tonight.

8
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,840
Darling, I need to see
everything you've got.

9
00:00:16,841 --> 00:00:19,573
All assets go into escrow
immediately.

10
00:00:19,574 --> 00:00:20,886
I'll see you in court.

11
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:23,930
Ivy Lynn is coming in.

12
00:00:23,931 --> 00:00:25,265
Derek wills is available.

13
00:00:25,266 --> 00:00:26,808
He is a terrible
human being!

14
00:00:27,225 --> 00:00:28,894
I got called back
for <i>Marilyn.</i>

15
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:31,688
I got a callback.

16
00:00:35,441 --> 00:00:38,907

â™ª call me â™ª

41
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,595
Karen.
What are you doing?

42
00:01:45,596 --> 00:01:47,013
You've got a three-top,

43
00:01:47,014 --> 00:01:48,806
and the guy at your front table
wants more coffee.

44
00:01:48,807 --> 00:01:50,475
What?
I'm sorry... what?

45
00:01:51,726 --> 00:01:53,562
Relax.
I took care of it.

46
00:01:53,563 --> 00:01:56,014
But you are so not here.
Still haven't heard?

47
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,481
- No.
- How long has it been?

48
00:01:57,482 --> 00:01:58,782
- Four days.
- That's not so good.

49
00:01:58,783 --> 00:01:59,983
I know.
I'm so stressed,

50
00:01:59,984 --> 00:02:01,952
I just wish
they would call me.

51
00:02:01,953 --> 00:02:03,319
- Karen.
- Ugh.

52
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,406
Here ya go, hon.

53
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:06,074
You're gonna get it.

54
00:02:06,075 --> 00:02:07,457
Thanks.

55
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:10,060
It's Ivy's part.

56
00:02:10,061 --> 00:02:12,622
She has Marilyn's soul.
She has her body.

57
00:02:12,623 --> 00:02:13,896
She looks like Marilyn.

58
00:02:13,897 --> 00:02:15,297
This girl feels like
Marilyn.

59
00:02:15,298 --> 00:02:16,710
How do you know
what she feels like?

60
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:18,795
Okay, don't go there.

61
00:02:18,796 --> 00:02:20,964
Straight men
are gonna go there.

62
00:02:20,965 --> 00:02:23,592
- This girl is hot.
- They're both beautiful girls.

63
00:02:23,593 --> 00:02:26,508
But only one of them
has the experience to do this.

64
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:28,477
Well, that's the thing, tom.

65
00:02:28,478 --> 00:02:30,545
Experience is precisely
what we're not looking for.

66
00:02:30,546 --> 00:02:33,518
That innocence, that freshness...
It's very Marilyn.

67
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,353
She has to have chops.

68
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:37,856
- That girl has chops.
- I agree.

69
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:40,025
- What a great voice, huh?
- Give me a break.

70
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,443
Ivy has one of the best...

71
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:43,324
Yes, Ivy also has
an amazing voice.

72
00:02:43,325 --> 00:02:44,696
No one here is saying
she doesn't.

73
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:47,160
And she can act.
And she can dance.

74
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:49,229
And she has ten years
of Broadway experience.

75
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,953
Okay, look, we can't just keep
going over and over and over

76
00:02:51,954 --> 00:02:53,789
- the same question!
- No...

77
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,208
He's right.

78
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,919
I'm sorry... huh?
What did you say?

79
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,060
You are right, tom.
You are absolutely right.

80
00:03:04,507 --> 00:03:07,828
I'm fighting this hard I can
'cause' kidding myself.

81
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:11,556
I can't handle this over
to a completely neophyte

82
00:03:11,557 --> 00:03:14,142
not withtout more information.

83
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:19,725
- Can I help you?
- I'm tom's assistant.

84
00:03:19,726 --> 00:03:22,494
I know who you are.

85
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:26,431
Get me Joe Machota at CAA.

86
00:03:28,768 --> 00:03:30,909
You have to do
another callback?

87
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,938
It's Marilyn Monroe.
It's the part of a lifetime.

88
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:35,940
If I have to jump through
a few hoops, so be it.

89
00:03:35,941 --> 00:03:39,409
- Are they seeing more people?
- Just me and one other person.

90
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,912
Somebody new.
Karen something.

91
00:03:41,913 --> 00:03:43,421
They didn't see her do
a dance audition,

92
00:03:43,422 --> 00:03:45,282
so they're calling her back
for that.

93
00:03:45,283 --> 00:03:47,118
We're both getting
called back for scene work,

94
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:49,353
- but I don't have to dance.
- It's classic.

95
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,654
You put in ten years
in the chorus,

96
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:53,823
stop, please.
I'm a wreck.

97
00:03:53,824 --> 00:03:55,759
I'm just pretending
to be brave.

98
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,795
- I'm scared to death.
- So it's another callback.

99
00:03:58,796 --> 00:04:00,830
- You'll nail this one too.
- I'd better!

100
00:04:00,831 --> 00:04:03,266
'Cause I really don't wanna
put on those feathers anymore.

101
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:05,168
I'm so sick of
going out on that stage

102
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:06,869
looking like
a demented duck.

103
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,365
Tell me about it.
[Laughter]

104
00:04:16,787 --> 00:04:19,583
Everyone, uh,
gather round.

105
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:21,716
The budget is almost ready.

106
00:04:21,717 --> 00:04:24,462
We'll have all the schedules
printed and distributed

107
00:04:24,463 --> 00:04:26,320
both in hard copy
and electronically

108
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:28,156
by this afternoon, at which
point the budget director

109
00:04:28,157 --> 00:04:30,176
- will be available for questions.
- You got nothing else?

110
00:04:30,177 --> 00:04:32,304
Something we maybe
could sell papers with?

111
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:35,265
I apologize for our current
lack of scandal.

112
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:37,165
I know this makes your life
boring and difficult.

113
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,399
I'm sure someone

114
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,603
will do something stupid
or illegal soon.

115
00:04:39,604 --> 00:04:41,468
If I were you,
I'd count on it.

116
00:04:41,469 --> 00:04:43,304
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a lunch date

117
00:04:43,305 --> 00:04:44,816
with a young lady who's
significantly more attractive

118
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,526
than you clowns.

119
00:04:50,988 --> 00:04:53,314
- You okay?
- My agent called.

120
00:04:53,315 --> 00:04:55,381
They want another callback.
I have to dance.

121
00:04:55,382 --> 00:04:56,816
Oh, well,
you're a terrific da...

122
00:04:56,817 --> 00:04:58,518
The choreographer's
gonna love you.

123
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,885
- It's the director.
- The director?

124
00:04:59,886 --> 00:05:01,041
He's the choreographer.

125
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:03,556
Sometimes they do both,
you know?

126
00:05:03,557 --> 00:05:05,725
Oh. This is the guy who had
you come over to his apartment

127
00:05:05,726 --> 00:05:07,797
at 10:00 at night
for a coaching session.

128
00:05:07,798 --> 00:05:11,551
Mm. You never said much
about what happened that night.

129
00:05:11,552 --> 00:05:13,398
Well, because nothing
happened.

130
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,347
Come on.

131
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:20,105
Birth certificates
notarized and authenticated.

132
00:05:20,106 --> 00:05:21,686
Marriage certificate.

133
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:23,942
18 years?
That's impressive.

134
00:05:23,943 --> 00:05:27,111
Unheard of
in show business.

135
00:05:27,112 --> 00:05:31,582
Once the agency
signs off on your application,

136
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:34,051
it gets bundled
with other applications,

137
00:05:34,052 --> 00:05:35,853
then we send it to Beijing,

138
00:05:35,854 --> 00:05:37,955
and it gets translated
into mandarin.

139
00:05:37,956 --> 00:05:41,292
That should all take
about three or four months,

140
00:05:41,293 --> 00:05:42,999
and then the waiting begins.

141
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,394
Begins?

142
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:46,962
We've been at this
for ten months.

143
00:05:46,963 --> 00:05:49,089
Chinese bureaucracy
is very thorough.

144
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,925
Well, how much longer
are we talking about?

145
00:05:51,926 --> 00:05:53,677
Well... two years?

146
00:05:53,678 --> 00:05:58,390
I know.
The waiting is the hardest part.

147
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,743
Hi. Sorry.

148
00:06:00,744 --> 00:06:03,078
There was police action
on the subway.

149
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,562
Right.

150
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,985
Sorry. There was a police
action on the subway.

151
00:06:09,986 --> 00:06:12,153
Yeah.
So we've heard.

152
00:06:12,154 --> 00:06:13,589
- Hi.
- Hi.

153
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,955
This is our music composer

- [Whispers] Sorry.

Yes, I did.
She showed up late

175

and had to be shown the first
combination three times.

176
00:07:25,217 --> 00:07:27,812
I talked to her on the break.
She's from Iowa,

and her name
is Karen Cartwright.

178
00:07:29,687 --> 00:07:32,025

was Norma Jeane Mortenson.

179
00:07:32,026 --> 00:07:33,757

why she changed it.

I did not know that.

checks they put you thorough

write a musical?

You can't build a musical
by just writing songs.

to mean?

00:14:59,806 --> 00:15:02,181
Hey, listen, we've been invited
to dinner this Wednesday.

348
00:15:02,182 --> 00:15:04,550
- Who with?
- One of the deputy mayors.

349
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:06,151
- Ooh!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

350
00:15:06,152 --> 00:15:08,554
They're thinking about
promoting me, actually.

351
00:15:08,555 --> 00:15:09,922
Awesome!

352
00:15:09,923 --> 00:15:11,824
- Then you'll be powerful too.
- Yeah.

353
00:15:11,825 --> 00:15:13,986
- And very hard to deal with.
- Mm...

354
00:15:13,987 --> 00:15:17,495
[As Marilyn]
Thank you ever so.

355
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:19,597
Thank you ever so.

356
00:15:19,598 --> 00:15:22,099
Okay.
That's a little spooky.

357
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,664
She does this thing
with her lips...

358
00:15:24,665 --> 00:15:27,572
The top lip doesn't move
with the bottom one.

359
00:15:27,573 --> 00:15:28,740
[Breathy gasp]

360
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:30,675
Thank you ever so.

361
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:32,004
Okay,
you're freaking me out.

362
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:33,881
How are you doing that?

363
00:15:33,882 --> 00:15:35,846
[Breathy laugh]

364
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:38,761
[Continues giggling]

365
00:15:38,762 --> 00:15:40,346
Stop it!

366
00:15:40,347 --> 00:15:42,118
[Both laughing]

367
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:43,224
Hmm.

368
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:45,922
Great. Yeah.

369
00:15:45,923 --> 00:15:47,558
Thank you, Rene.

370
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:48,792
I'll... I'll get right on this.

371
00:15:48,793 --> 00:15:50,560
Bye.

372
00:15:50,561 --> 00:15:52,928
What was that?
Umum...

373
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:55,736
Meetings for our group
start Friday.

374
00:15:56,066 --> 00:15:59,268
We need...
To write a short letter

375
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:02,238
to the birth mother
of our child.

376
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:03,706
Obviously,
she'll never get it,

377
00:16:03,707 --> 00:16:05,830
because the babies
are abandoned

378
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,208
and our daughter,
let's face it,

379
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:08,877
isn't even born yet,
but...

380
00:16:08,878 --> 00:16:11,045
Something they ask you to do
to get people...

381
00:16:11,046 --> 00:16:13,482
Engaged in the process.

382
00:16:13,483 --> 00:16:15,417
Okay?

383
00:16:17,257 --> 00:16:18,653
What?

384
00:16:23,805 --> 00:16:26,927
What?

385
00:16:26,928 --> 00:16:28,496
I just... I just think
we need to be

386
00:16:28,497 --> 00:16:32,099
more realistic about this.

387
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,232
Meaning what?

388
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:34,802
[Sighs]

389
00:16:34,803 --> 00:16:38,505
Their most conservative
estimate... two years.

390
00:16:38,506 --> 00:16:41,107
I'll be 47
when that baby comes.

391
00:16:41,108 --> 00:16:42,617
Well, I mean...

392
00:16:42,618 --> 00:16:47,246
Which would make me 65
when she graduated High School.

393
00:16:48,982 --> 00:16:51,751
So what, you don't want
to do this anymore?

394
00:16:56,589 --> 00:16:58,424
I'm sorry.

395
00:16:58,425 --> 00:17:01,260
- Well, that's just great.
- Okay, first of all,

396
00:17:01,261 --> 00:17:03,328
you should not be
eavesdropping.

397
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:05,723
It's the only way I find
anything out around here.

398
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:07,725
- That is completely unfair.
- Oh, yeah,

399
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,186
you're just ready to tank
the whole thing,

400
00:17:10,187 --> 00:17:11,687
- and I'm the one who sucks.
- Let me.

401
00:17:30,521 --> 00:17:32,456
So I don't get a vote.

402
00:17:32,457 --> 00:17:34,390
- It's just over.
- No one is saying that.

403
00:17:34,391 --> 00:17:36,295
He said it.
Dad said it.

404
00:17:39,997 --> 00:17:43,165
Your father has been anxious
about this for a long time, Leo.

405
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,233
People say things
when they're anxious.

406
00:17:45,234 --> 00:17:47,736
- Yeah, like, "I quit."
- That's not what we're saying.

407
00:17:47,737 --> 00:17:50,806
Mom, we've been talking
about this forever.

408
00:17:50,807 --> 00:17:52,908
Ever since I was a little kid,

409
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:55,523
you told me I'd be getting
a brother or sister.

410
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:57,846
- We did say that.
- You just told me

411
00:17:57,847 --> 00:18:00,482
I had to wait,
and then you said...

412
00:18:00,483 --> 00:18:02,517
You said my sister
is in China.

413
00:18:02,518 --> 00:18:04,490
She's waiting for us
in China.

414
00:18:04,491 --> 00:18:06,988
And I believed you.
Why wouldn't I believe you?

415
00:18:06,989 --> 00:18:08,411
You told me.

416
00:18:08,412 --> 00:18:12,164
She's waiting for us
to come and get her.

417
00:18:12,165 --> 00:18:16,229
What is gonna happen to her
if we don't go get her?

418
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,842
- Good show.
- Bye. Thank you.

419
00:18:22,843 --> 00:18:25,205
- Hmm.
- Good night.

420
00:18:25,206 --> 00:18:27,513
I hope Derek's
not too hideous.

421
00:18:27,514 --> 00:18:29,682
He's very professional.

422
00:18:29,683 --> 00:18:32,578
If he steps out of line,
let me know?

423
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:34,603
Ohh.
My own Johnny Hyde.

424
00:18:34,604 --> 00:18:37,356
- Who's Johnny Hyde?
- Marilyn's first agent.

425
00:18:37,357 --> 00:18:39,051
He adored her.

426
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:41,521
He was very protective,
and then he died tragically,

427
00:18:41,522 --> 00:18:43,288
and her career
totally tanked.

428
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,030
You don't know
who Johnny Hyde is?

429
00:18:45,031 --> 00:18:48,159
I do. I just like listening
to you talk about Marilyn.

430
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,702
[Laughs]

431
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,634
I would have just
given it to you.

432
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,251
I know.

433
00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:03,641
[Dinner music]

434
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,776
Eileen.

435
00:19:08,713 --> 00:19:09,764
Hello, Jerry.

436
00:19:09,765 --> 00:19:11,891
Wow. You're Eileen rand.

437
00:19:11,892 --> 00:19:13,918
Wow. You are such
a great producer.

438
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,320
- Hi. I'm Lindsey Mullens.
- We've met.

439
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:20,566
- I don't think so.
- I do.

440
00:19:23,427 --> 00:19:25,762
- You all right?
- Absolutely.

441
00:19:25,763 --> 00:19:27,072
How's it going?

442
00:19:27,073 --> 00:19:30,433
Well, Ivy's terrific.

443
00:19:30,434 --> 00:19:32,745
She's a perfectionist.

444
00:19:34,671 --> 00:19:37,739
If I'm gonna sink $200,000,
in this workshop,

445
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,642
I need to know
the girl can carry it.

446
00:19:40,643 --> 00:19:42,744
Too perfect
I can live with.

447
00:19:42,745 --> 00:19:44,298
Yeah, she's trying
too hard.

448
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:48,761
What about the new girl?

449
00:19:48,762 --> 00:19:50,137
excellent.

450
00:19:50,138 --> 00:19:52,223
Green doesn't even
beginning to it.

451
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:55,322
Well, Marilyn was green
at the beginning.

452
00:19:55,323 --> 00:19:57,157
You don't say.
I don't know.

453
00:19:57,158 --> 00:20:00,561
Maybe neither of them's
right for it.

454
00:20:00,562 --> 00:20:02,362
Maybe...

455
00:20:02,363 --> 00:20:04,398
Scarlett Johansson's movie'll
fall through.

456
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:05,799
Get it out of your head.

457
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,667
We're not chasing stars
on this one.

458
00:20:07,668 --> 00:20:09,865
We're casting Marilyn
on Friday.

459
00:20:09,866 --> 00:20:11,909
Eileen, Derek.

460
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,536
- Hi, Jordan.
- Hey, Jordan.

461
00:20:13,537 --> 00:20:14,912
Can I borrow him
a second?

462
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,509
- Sure.
- I'll be right back.

463
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,457
- Not too long.
- I know.

464
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,684
Have I given you
any indication

465
00:20:25,685 --> 00:20:27,519
that I have any interest
in speaking with you

466
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,421
ever again?

467
00:20:29,422 --> 00:20:32,992
Can I have a Manhattan?
She'll have one too.

468
00:20:32,993 --> 00:20:34,326
So...

469
00:20:34,327 --> 00:20:36,141
Derek wills, huh?

470
00:20:36,142 --> 00:20:38,686
You managed to hang on to him
after <i>my fair lady</i> fell through.

471
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:41,480
Ryan
has a vampire musical.

472
00:20:41,481 --> 00:20:43,357
Would you
get out of my booth?

473
00:20:43,358 --> 00:20:47,528
I'm not giving you Bond 45
in the divorce, Jerry.

474
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:50,447
What's this Marilyn thing I?

475
00:20:50,448 --> 00:20:52,533
- It's none of your business.
- Where you getting the money?

476
00:20:52,534 --> 00:20:53,784
Why don't you
go back to Mindy?

477
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:54,952
Lindsey.

478
00:20:55,246 --> 00:20:56,613
I dot t care
what her name is.

479
00:20:56,614 --> 00:20:58,330
Would you
get out of my booth?

480
00:21:01,252 --> 00:21:04,087
Let me give you
a little advice, Eileen.

481
00:21:04,088 --> 00:21:06,556
We were good partners
because I knew the business,

482
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,382
which allowed you
to be the romantic.

483
00:21:08,383 --> 00:21:11,193
All this nonsense,
theatre is art...

484
00:21:11,194 --> 00:21:13,062
You deluded yourself,

485
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,639
and then you fell in love
with the delusion.

486
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,966
<i>Marilyn, the musical?</i>

487
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:19,977
No one is gonna buy it.

488
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:22,704
You're making a fool
of yourself.

489
00:21:22,705 --> 00:21:24,438
Hey!

490
00:21:27,076 --> 00:21:28,877
Oh, dear.

491
00:21:28,878 --> 00:21:31,212
We're gonna have to find
ourselves another restaurant.

492
00:21:32,546 --> 00:21:34,281
Okay.

493
00:21:36,034 --> 00:21:38,610
Okay, we're talking
20 the most

494
00:21:38,611 --> 00:21:40,144
experienced dancers
and singers.

495
00:21:40,145 --> 00:21:42,041
And what are we gonna do
for the other principals?

496
00:21:42,042 --> 00:21:44,014
They haven't even finished
the end of the book yet.

497
00:21:44,015 --> 00:21:46,283
- We'll call you back, Bernie!
- We'll call you back.

498
00:21:46,284 --> 00:21:48,017
I'm just gonna touch base
with Julia

499
00:21:48,018 --> 00:21:50,799
and find out what's happening
with the new pages.

500
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,456
Hang on, Eileen,
can we just take a minute

501
00:21:52,457 --> 00:21:53,719
to talk about the bigger
picture of this?

502
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,680
Nothing is bigger
than Broadway.

503
00:21:56,681 --> 00:21:58,328
I'm aware.

504
00:21:58,329 --> 00:22:00,296
But what's the plan
after the workshop?

505
00:22:00,297 --> 00:22:02,064
We... we give people a taste,
and then what?

506
00:22:02,065 --> 00:22:04,980
We'll work on it
for two or three years, and...

507
00:22:04,981 --> 00:22:07,503
No. Mostly what I see
on Broadway's overworked.

508
00:22:07,504 --> 00:22:10,402
You know,
I love the songs.

509
00:22:10,403 --> 00:22:12,071
I love the scenes they have.

510
00:22:12,072 --> 00:22:14,615
I love Marilyn.
Why don't we just do it?

511
00:22:14,616 --> 00:22:17,368
- Okay. So...
- So...

512
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,881
We do a workshop,
we try it out of town,

513
00:22:19,882 --> 00:22:21,288
we bring it to Broadway.

514
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:22,790
Well, it's pretty fast.

515
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:26,293
I love fast.
Go get me a Marilyn.

516
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:27,589
[Under breath]
â™ª in this factory â™ª

517
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,990
â™ª where dreams
can come true

518
00:22:28,991 --> 00:22:31,526
â™ª are you ready
to make someone new â™ª

519
00:22:31,527 --> 00:22:33,427
see? I was right.
You're a terrific dancer.

520
00:22:33,428 --> 00:22:35,028
The rhythms
are really complicated.

521
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:36,730
- I can't remember this.
- You have the address

522
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:38,432
- of the restaurant, right?
- Yeah. It's in my cell.

523
00:22:38,433 --> 00:22:39,933
I can't pick you up,
you know.

524
00:22:39,934 --> 00:22:41,535
No, no, no,
we rehearse till 7:00,

525
00:22:41,536 --> 00:22:42,603
so I'll just change
at the rehearsal hall

526
00:22:42,604 --> 00:22:44,004
and come straight over.

527
00:22:44,005 --> 00:22:45,396
Don't worry.

528
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:47,741
I know it's important.
I'll be there.

529
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:49,909
Go. You're making me nervous.

530
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,276
Get out.

531
00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:57,216
What are you working on?

532
00:22:57,217 --> 00:22:58,826
Oh.

533
00:22:58,827 --> 00:23:00,720
You know, just stuff.

534
00:23:00,721 --> 00:23:02,789
[Light laugh]

535
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:05,023
Listen...

536
00:23:05,024 --> 00:23:07,959
I wanna go back to work.

537
00:23:09,762 --> 00:23:12,840
- Oh...
- I know. I know.

538
00:23:12,841 --> 00:23:14,700
It's been a while.

539
00:23:14,701 --> 00:23:17,703
But there's always a market
for good science teachers...

540
00:23:17,704 --> 00:23:18,971
And I miss it.

541
00:23:18,972 --> 00:23:22,072
You miss
the periodic table?

542
00:23:22,073 --> 00:23:25,602
I do, actually.
Ha.

543
00:23:25,603 --> 00:23:28,689
And...
I miss the kids.

544
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:32,316
And what about
the adoption?

545
00:23:32,317 --> 00:23:35,553
- Julia.
- Hmm?

546
00:23:35,554 --> 00:23:37,698
I can't wait anymore.

547
00:23:37,699 --> 00:23:42,091
You have your writing.
All I ha I is the waiting.

548
00:23:42,092 --> 00:23:44,561
Leo's gone all day.
I need something.

549
00:23:44,562 --> 00:23:46,629
And... I'm a teacher.

550
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,898
I'm a good teacher.

551
00:23:50,835 --> 00:23:53,714
Even though I never could get
you to understand p orbitals.

552
00:23:53,715 --> 00:23:56,137
Well, that was because

553
00:23:56,138 --> 00:23:57,840
every time you'd start
describing them,

554
00:23:57,841 --> 00:24:00,843
it was just so sexy,
I'd get distracted.

555
00:24:26,412 --> 00:24:27,834
I'll see everyone
at the callbacks on Friday.

556
00:24:27,835 --> 00:24:30,136
Thanks for your work.
I appreciate it.

557
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:32,038
Thank you.

558
00:24:34,942 --> 00:24:36,510
- There a problem?
- Oh, no, no, no.

559
00:24:36,511 --> 00:24:38,612
- She's on her way.
- I finally get to meet

560
00:24:38,613 --> 00:24:40,679
- the famous Karen.
- I didn't know she was famous.

561
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,638
Andrew says
she's very attractive.

562
00:24:42,639 --> 00:24:44,473
That's why he wanted you
to bring her.

563
00:24:44,474 --> 00:24:46,685
Klein has an eye
for the ladies.

564
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:49,895
[Chuckles] Look, I'm not
gonna say that he doesn't,

565
00:24:49,896 --> 00:24:53,690
but fact is, Dev and I are
the ones on the line tonight.

566
00:24:53,691 --> 00:24:55,484
Oh, hang on,
miss Cartwright.

567
00:24:55,485 --> 00:24:57,402
I haven't finished
with you yet.

568
00:24:59,654 --> 00:25:01,666
- Oh.
- We would have done it earlier,

569
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,700
but the dance took a little
bit longer than it should have.

570
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:05,737
You ready for me?

571
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:07,704
Oh, yeah, come on in.

572
00:25:07,705 --> 00:25:10,999
Dave's gonna read with you.
I'm sorry, is there a problem?

573
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,877
- It's not gonna take very long.
- No, no.

574
00:25:13,878 --> 00:25:15,746
Good.

575
00:25:20,466 --> 00:25:22,678
So you're the deputy
press secretary.

576
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:25,021
- Yes. Yes, sir.
- He's doing an amazing job.

577
00:25:25,022 --> 00:25:27,724
He is much better with those
animals in the press corps

578
00:25:27,725 --> 00:25:29,391
- than I ever was.
- They can be quite a handful.

579
00:25:29,392 --> 00:25:30,811
You've just got to
feed them properly...

580
00:25:30,812 --> 00:25:32,227
No red meat.

581
00:25:32,228 --> 00:25:35,440
Andrew says
you're very dedicated.

582
00:25:35,441 --> 00:25:37,333
She coming?

583
00:25:37,334 --> 00:25:39,319
Oh, yeah, no.
I'm sure she's on her way.

584
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,938
'Cause stability
is important in this job.

585
00:25:41,939 --> 00:25:44,825
Even though none of you
are ever home.

586
00:25:44,826 --> 00:25:46,702
[Andrew laughing]

587
00:25:46,703 --> 00:25:48,176
I think we should
go ahead and order.

588
00:25:48,177 --> 00:25:49,845
Yeah.
[Ahem]

589
00:25:49,846 --> 00:25:51,412
I don't like the way
they look at you.

590
00:25:51,413 --> 00:25:53,348
I can't help the way
they look at me, Joe.

591
00:25:53,349 --> 00:25:56,084
You love it.
You love every bit of it.

592
00:25:56,085 --> 00:25:58,547
The way you walk,
the way you sing,

593
00:25:58,548 --> 00:26:00,591
- the way you dress.
- It's my job to look like this.

594
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:03,510
Your job is to take care
of me and our home.

595
00:26:03,511 --> 00:26:06,093
I gave up baseball.
Why can't you give up movies?

596
00:26:06,094 --> 00:26:08,428
I want to, Joe.

597
00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:10,397
Do you need me to be doing
more Marilyn?

598
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:12,227
Sorry.

599
00:26:12,228 --> 00:26:14,855
It's hard to say
what it needs,

600
00:26:14,856 --> 00:26:17,149
'cause right now
you're not doing anything.

601
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,939
Dave, move.

602
00:26:22,195 --> 00:26:25,945
Look, Karen...

603
00:26:25,946 --> 00:26:28,715
You have a lot of what
makes Marilyn Marilyn

604
00:26:28,716 --> 00:26:30,913
essentially in you, okay?

605
00:26:30,914 --> 00:26:34,875
So just play the action.

606
00:26:34,876 --> 00:26:38,824
You wanna please him.
You wanna make him happy.

607
00:26:38,825 --> 00:26:41,715
It terrifies you
that he's this unhappy.

608
00:26:41,716 --> 00:26:45,427
So don't do her.

609
00:26:45,428 --> 00:26:48,639
Just be her, okay?

610
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,557
Okay.

611
00:26:53,238 --> 00:26:55,938
Okay, let's try again.

612
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:02,986
[Phone vibrating]

613
00:27:14,692 --> 00:27:16,660
Where were you?

614
00:27:16,661 --> 00:27:18,828
Rehearsal went late.

615
00:27:18,829 --> 00:27:20,629
I've been texting you
for hours.

616
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,672
I know, I...

617
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:25,300
It was mortifying.

618
00:27:25,301 --> 00:27:27,803
I'm sorry.

619
00:27:30,339 --> 00:27:32,599
I just don't understand
why you couldn't call or text.

620
00:27:33,176 --> 00:27:35,177
The last I heard from you was,
"I'm on my way."

621
00:27:35,178 --> 00:27:36,945
I was worried about you
the whole dinner.

622
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,772
- I couldn't focus.
- I couldn't get out.

623
00:27:38,773 --> 00:27:40,774
You couldn't even say,
sorry, I need a minute?

624
00:27:40,775 --> 00:27:42,693
I have to text my boyfriend
who I'm standing up!

625
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:44,652
This brilliant,
powerful director

626
00:27:44,653 --> 00:27:46,721
is that powerful that you
couldn't even ask the question?

627
00:27:46,722 --> 00:27:48,623
I got confused.
There wasn't the right moment.

628
00:27:48,624 --> 00:27:50,993
I'm sorry.
Dev!

629
00:27:50,994 --> 00:27:52,953
I'm really sorry.

630
00:28:05,596 --> 00:28:06,763
I'm not crazy.

631
00:28:06,764 --> 00:28:08,364
People wanna think that.

632
00:28:08,365 --> 00:28:10,899
They say I'm crazy...

633
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,401
[Exhales]
I'm sorry.

634
00:28:12,402 --> 00:28:13,515
No, no.

635
00:28:13,516 --> 00:28:16,038
It's difficult.

636
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:19,208
Well, the DiMaggio scene
is less internal.

637
00:28:19,209 --> 00:28:21,773
Quite a bit.

638
00:28:21,774 --> 00:28:26,748
It's just that word,
crazy, it...

639
00:28:26,749 --> 00:28:29,617
Just feels so volatile.

640
00:28:29,618 --> 00:28:31,853
She was so afraid
her whole life

641
00:28:31,854 --> 00:28:33,785
that she'd end up being crazy
like her mother.

642
00:28:33,786 --> 00:28:36,580
Yeah. That's definitely
in there.

643
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:40,375
[Exhales]

644
00:28:53,074 --> 00:28:54,806
[Exhales]

645
00:29:00,414 --> 00:29:02,582
I'm not crazy.

646
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:04,984
People want to think that.

647
00:29:07,153 --> 00:29:09,989
They say I'm crazy
because I want things,

648
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,782
but the things I want...

649
00:29:15,618 --> 00:29:18,229
I want love.

650
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,799
I don't want...

651
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,967
Well...

652
00:29:22,968 --> 00:29:25,937
A sex object is a thing.

653
00:29:25,938 --> 00:29:28,965
Who would want
to be a thing?

654
00:29:28,966 --> 00:29:32,052
Okay, hang on.

655
00:29:45,273 --> 00:29:47,123
May I?

656
00:30:26,856 --> 00:30:27,941
- Hey, Dennis.
- Hi.

Ha. I'm fine.
I'm good.

You look stunning.
Doesn't she?

666

Look at that top.
Perfect choice, of course.

Sit, sit, sit.

668
00:30:47,682 --> 00:30:49,815
Thank you so much
for doing this.

669
00:30:49,816 --> 00:30:51,965
Oh. I'm thrilled
you've given me the chance.

670
00:30:51,966 --> 00:30:53,853
Well, hopefully,
we won't be torturing you

671

for too much longer.

672
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:57,690
It is nerve-wracking.

673
00:30:57,691 --> 00:31:01,016
Everything feels so important
the first time.

674
00:31:01,017 --> 00:31:03,662
Doesn't it feel that way
every time?

675
00:31:03,663 --> 00:31:06,813
Yes. It does feel
that way every time.

676
00:31:06,814 --> 00:31:10,502
You're just a a little more
used to it driving you crazy.

678
00:31:11,444 --> 00:31:13,028
Yeah, just be you.

679
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:15,280
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

680
00:31:15,281 --> 00:31:18,176
- Come on, tom.
- Okay!

681
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:21,512
Have to go.

682
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,258
So we'll start with
the dance call

683
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,967
and then move on
to the scene work.

684
00:31:35,968 --> 00:31:38,194
Good for me.

00:31:38,195 --> 00:31:39,221
He hey.

686
00:31:39,222 --> 00:31:41,223
Just relax.

You're great in this.

the song was so good,

and staged the whole thing.

â™ª mambo â™ª

752
00:34:35,729 --> 00:34:38,229
well, no one can say we don't
have enough h information.

753
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,465
Nope.
Information we have.

754
00:34:40,466 --> 00:34:43,446
I thought Karen's dancing
was good.

755
00:34:43,447 --> 00:34:45,365
She might be green,
but she's certainly trained.

756
00:34:45,366 --> 00:34:47,492
- She's a star.
- Well, you can't say that

757
00:34:47,493 --> 00:34:49,577
until it happens,
but it could happen, yes.

758
00:34:49,578 --> 00:34:51,621
Ivy was incredible.

759
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:53,710
- She was.
- I thought she was

760
00:34:53,711 --> 00:34:56,079
completely spontususus
and sexy.

761
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,881
Yes, she is that and more.

762
00:34:57,882 --> 00:34:59,504
She's intelligent,
she's passionate.

763
00:34:59,505 --> 00:35:01,506
She's beautiful.

764
00:35:01,507 --> 00:35:02,819
I thought her reading
of the new pages

765
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,843
was pitch-perfect.

766
00:35:04,844 --> 00:35:07,178
Was it too perfect?

767
00:35:07,179 --> 00:35:09,806
Yeah, I dunno.

768
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:12,726
There's a lonelys there,
a wound that...

769
00:35:12,727 --> 00:35:14,728
Was heart-breaking, really.

770
00:35:14,729 --> 00:35:16,354
[Sighs]

771
00:35:16,355 --> 00:35:18,367
And Karen is more of
an innocent,

772
00:35:18,368 --> 00:35:21,270
which is also good
for Marilyn.

773
00:35:23,373 --> 00:35:24,696
So?

774
00:35:24,697 --> 00:35:26,908
They getting anywhere?

775
00:35:26,909 --> 00:35:28,616
Not yet.

776
00:35:28,617 --> 00:35:30,612
Any word yet?

777
00:35:30,613 --> 00:35:32,447
I'm about to crawl
out of my skin.

778
00:35:32,448 --> 00:35:34,247
Oh...

779
00:35:34,248 --> 00:35:36,451
- Nothing yet?
- Not a word.

780
00:35:36,452 --> 00:35:38,886
- This is awful.
- I know.

781
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,628
Night, you guys.

782
00:35:40,629 --> 00:35:42,464
Night.

783
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,694
- You okay?
- I don't want to talk about it.

784
00:35:46,695 --> 00:35:48,729
I can't believe
it's going on like this.

785
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,297
I don't want
to talk about it.

786
00:35:50,298 --> 00:35:54,067
Ivy.
Hi.

787
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:56,102
I wanted to come

788
00:35:56,103 --> 00:35:58,104
and tell you in person.

789
00:35:58,105 --> 00:36:00,906
I didn't get it.

790
00:36:00,907 --> 00:36:02,908
God, I didn't get it.
It's okay.

791
00:36:02,909 --> 00:36:04,819
It's okay, tom.
I just have to get outta here.

792
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:07,906
Ivy, stop!

793
00:36:07,907 --> 00:36:10,550
You got it.

794
00:36:10,551 --> 00:36:12,327
I got it?

795
00:36:12,328 --> 00:36:13,995
You're Marilyn.

796
00:36:13,996 --> 00:36:15,747
Oh, my God, I got it!

797
00:36:15,748 --> 00:36:18,625
[Laughter, chatter]

798
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,827
Are you all right?

799
00:36:21,828 --> 00:36:23,795
I don't know what to do.

800
00:36:23,796 --> 00:36:25,731
I don't know what to do!

801
00:36:27,716 --> 00:36:30,512
[Laughter]

802
00:36:30,513 --> 00:36:35,005
So you feel good
about our choice?

803
00:36:35,006 --> 00:36:37,641
If I didn't, I wouldn't
have gone along with it.

804
00:36:37,642 --> 00:36:40,104
She's a very talented
young lady.

805
00:36:40,105 --> 00:36:43,781
- And lucky.
- We're all lucky.

806
00:36:43,782 --> 00:36:46,349
And the Cartwright girl,
maybe not so much.

807
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:48,618
That's true.

808
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:50,532
But I'd keep my eye
on that one.

809
00:36:56,694 --> 00:37:00,363
Eileen, I need to talk
to you about something.

810
00:37:00,364 --> 00:37:01,668
Yes?

811
00:37:05,835 --> 00:37:09,538
I, uh...

812
00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:13,375
I don't want it getting
back to you in a bad way.

813
00:37:17,145 --> 00:37:20,515
Jerry's picked up the option
on <i>my fair lady.</i>

814
00:37:20,516 --> 00:37:23,851
He did?

815
00:37:23,852 --> 00:37:26,387
Yeah. He wants me
back on board.

816
00:37:29,024 --> 00:37:33,616
You know, I spent three years
of my life on that production.

817
00:37:33,617 --> 00:37:36,162
- That's a lot of work
- mm.

818
00:37:38,287 --> 00:37:41,468
So I, uh...

819
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:45,044
Basically went ahead
and told him to, uh,

820
00:37:45,045 --> 00:37:47,340
shove it.

821
00:37:47,341 --> 00:37:49,215
You did?

822
00:37:49,216 --> 00:37:51,843
Yeah.

823
00:37:51,844 --> 00:37:54,178
Call me crazy,
but I kinda like <i>Marilyn.</i>

824
00:37:55,816 --> 00:38:00,085
She is not the American
Eliza Doolittle at all.

825
00:38:00,086 --> 00:38:02,755
She's much more
interesting than that.

826
00:38:02,756 --> 00:38:06,024
I certainly think so.

827
00:38:06,025 --> 00:38:08,443
It also helps you reasier
on the eye than Jerry.

828
00:38:10,402 --> 00:38:12,280
See you tomorrow.

829
00:38:15,434 --> 00:38:17,435
[Sniffles]
Whew.

830
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,706
Hey, I just heard
that it's a special night

831
00:38:22,707 --> 00:38:24,918
for one of our friends.

832
00:38:24,919 --> 00:38:28,379
Ivy Lynn just landed
a big gig playing Marilyn Monroe

833
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,173
in a new musical
headed for Broadway.

834
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:31,949
Come on, Ivy,
how 'bout a song?

835
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:32,926
Oh, no.

836
00:38:32,927 --> 00:38:34,084
[Chanting]
Ivy, Ivy,

837
00:38:34,085 --> 00:38:37,353
Ivy, Ivy, Ivy!

838
00:38:39,932 --> 00:38:42,477
Okay. Would anyone else
like to share their letter?

839
00:38:47,064 --> 00:38:49,567
I-I guess I can.

840
00:38:54,436 --> 00:38:57,367
"To the birth mother
of my daughter.

841
00:38:57,368 --> 00:39:01,242
"Our lives are so far distant
from each other,

842
00:39:01,243 --> 00:39:04,958
"it is as if
neither of us exists.

843
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:07,649
"I will never know you,

844
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,416
"even though you may
give birth to her,

845
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:12,887
"my daughter may never
know you as well.

846
00:39:12,888 --> 00:39:17,090
"But I want you to know
I will guard her like a lion.

847
00:39:17,636 --> 00:39:20,060
"I will raise her with love,

848
00:39:20,061 --> 00:39:23,631
"I will protect her from
the wounds of loneliness.

849
00:39:23,632 --> 00:39:25,932
"She will be a child
of two lands,

850
00:39:25,933 --> 00:39:29,669
"and she will wear
that knowledge with pride.

851
00:39:30,149 --> 00:39:33,506
"And at night, we will call
to you on the wind

852
00:39:33,507 --> 00:39:37,109
"and perhaps
you will hear us and know

853
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:40,034
she is safe."

854
00:39:41,347 --> 00:39:42,412
Sorry.

855
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:44,414
Uh...

856
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:47,417
I thought
I couldn't make it.

857
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:50,753
But, uh...

858
00:39:52,792 --> 00:39:54,693
Then I decided
I couldn't miss it.

859
00:39:54,694 --> 00:39:57,327
Well, we were just
reading the letters

860
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:58,511
that people have written.

861
00:39:58,512 --> 00:40:00,179
And she wrote
the best one.

862
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,974
I wish I had
written that one.

863
00:40:06,972 --> 00:40:10,398
- [Whispering]
- â™ª hello, you long shots â™ª
