makes one wrong move,,,

It's about time,
It was getting hot,

How very like lago,

He's lost no time endearing
himself to those in power.

to make it clear
to you lunkheads?!

775

Aladdin becomes sultan,,,

that will make me
the grand vizier,

like that idiot Jafar,

Ah-heh,
A funny thing happened,

798
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:38,690
You see, this guy took the lamp,

799
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:39,889
You probably
thought it was me,,,

800
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,831
'cause
it sounded a lot like me,,,

801
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,390
but a lot of people
sound like me,

802
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:45,334
Anyway,
he took the lamp and--Aah!

803
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,599
Calm yourself, lago,

804
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:51,734
I haven't come
for revenge against you,

805
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:53,869

So that's good to hear,

806
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:56,436

I thought that was your wish,

813

Are you quite all right?

814

noticing,,,

some new friends, too,

820
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:31,378
Friend?
Friend is such a strong word,

821
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,713
He's--he's more like
an acquaintance,

00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:38,484
I'm arranging
a little surprise for Aladdin,,,

823
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:42,754
and your job is
to lead him to the party,

824
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:45,660
You know, I don't think

I'm the guy for this job,

825
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:49,257
You know, you should talk to,
uh, the monkey!

826
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,734
Yeah! The monkey's really got
Aladdin's ear!

827
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:55,796
No, lago,,,you!

828

I can't explain it, Jasmine.

00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,530
I think we can trust Iago.

Well...

864
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:32,932

Uh, l--I was just thinking,

868
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,139
Maybe it's time you patched
things up with the sultan,

869
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:49,016
Uh, he might enjoy,,,
a nice scenic carpet ride?

870
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,681
-Hmm, that's a good idea,
-And I'll bring Genie,

871
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,622
He was a big hit
with the sultan.

872
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:54,817
No, no, no!

873
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:57,919

This isn't easy for me to say,,,

883
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:22,082
but I was wrong about you,

884
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,390
Aah! Wait a second!
