1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,834
<i>So here's what you missed
on Glee: The Glee Club started
out as underdogs,</i>

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:04,452
<i>singing show tunes in the choir
room, and now they're headed
to Chicago</i>

3
00:00:04,603 --> 00:00:06,387
<i>to compete for a national
championship.</i>

4
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:08,323
<i>I mean, they made it
to Nationals last year
in New York,</i>

5
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:09,882
<i>but they came in 12th.
It was sort of a nightmare.</i>

6
00:00:09,892 --> 00:00:11,967
<i>Rachel's nightmare totally
came true when she choked</i>

7
00:00:11,994 --> 00:00:13,894
<i>at her NYADA audition,
and literally all she's talked</i>

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,780
<i>about for three years is New
York, Broadway, Streisand,
Dreams, Broadway.</i>

9
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:19,166
<i>Ugh!
And that's what you missed
on Glee.</i>

10
00:00:20,819 --> 00:00:21,869
(beeping)

11
00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:23,988
What's going on?
How bad is it?

12
00:00:24,022 --> 00:00:25,722
Her temperature's 101 degrees.

13
00:00:25,774 --> 00:00:27,709
Given the fact that Weezy's
complaining

14
00:00:27,793 --> 00:00:29,193
about an upset stomach,

15
00:00:29,227 --> 00:00:32,563
it's either Amazonian dengue
fever or the H1N1 super virus.

16
00:00:32,714 --> 00:00:33,961
Or I have
food poisoning.

17
00:00:33,982 --> 00:00:36,367
We all wanted burritos for
lunch, so we went to Chipotle,

18
00:00:36,418 --> 00:00:39,554
but Mercedes tried some dive
called "Señora Salsation."

19
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:41,105
Will, word, please.

20
00:00:41,156 --> 00:00:42,840
With Monique down
for the count,

21
00:00:42,891 --> 00:00:45,843
<i>we are entering
the Hunger Games of
show choir competition</i>

22
00:00:45,894 --> 00:00:47,862
without one of our most
powerful voices.

23
00:00:47,946 --> 00:00:49,213
We need to have a plan.

24
00:00:49,264 --> 00:00:51,147
Right. Because if New 
Directions doesn't win

25
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,316
that means you go back
to being co-captains

26
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:53,617
of the Cheerios with
Roz Washington.

27
00:00:53,669 --> 00:00:56,370
Your sniping is as expository
as it is wrong.

28
00:00:56,454 --> 00:00:58,856
Yes, I have fantasized
about handing that prize money

29
00:00:58,923 --> 00:01:02,226
to Principal Figgins
so I could buy back my sole
control of the Cheerios,

30
00:01:02,277 --> 00:01:05,279
but my main concern right now
is for these kids.

31
00:01:05,363 --> 00:01:06,998
I want this win for them.

32
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:09,724
I just don't want everything
we worked for to collapse

33
00:01:09,752 --> 00:01:11,469
because of one bad burrito.

34
00:01:12,136 --> 00:01:14,930
So here's what's gonna happen:
Mercedes, you're on bed rest,

35
00:01:14,956 --> 00:01:16,890
Quinn, you're stepping in.
No, no, no, I can't

36
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:18,899
dance that number. I can't sing
it, either, not like...

37
00:01:19,077 --> 00:01:20,277
The Trouble Tones need you.

38
00:01:20,328 --> 00:01:21,462
And you're better than you
think you are.

39
00:01:21,546 --> 00:01:22,746
Tina, you, too.
You're in the Trouble Tones.

40
00:01:22,798 --> 00:01:24,914
Mr. Shue, this is my last
competition.

41
00:01:24,966 --> 00:01:25,716
I don't want to miss it.

42
00:01:25,767 --> 00:01:27,734
Amen, to that, sister.
That's why I'm putting you

43
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,018
on a vitamin B-12 drip.

44
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,053
We're flushing your system

45
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:31,253
with Pedialyte, and I'm gonna

46
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:33,084
fill that bathtub with ice
and see if we can't get

47
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:34,959
your ambient body temperature
back down to normal.

48
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:37,077
<i>Worked in Jacob's Ladder.</i>

49
00:01:37,062 --> 00:01:38,629
All right, we all have
our marching orders.

50
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,280
Let's do it.

51
00:01:42,305 --> 00:01:42,305
+++

52
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:44,085
Hey.

53
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:46,870
You okay?

54
00:01:47,237 --> 00:01:50,737
What if we don't win? What's
gonna happen with those kids?

55
00:01:50,758 --> 00:01:52,092
It's a competition.

56
00:01:52,476 --> 00:01:54,476
They understand
that everybody can't win.

57
00:01:54,512 --> 00:01:56,176
But they never get to win.

58
00:01:56,181 --> 00:01:59,466
School's almost over,
forever for most of them.

59
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:02,686
Can you imagine what
what it would be like
for them

60
00:02:02,754 --> 00:02:05,105
to have just a couple
of days walking the halls
as champions?

61
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,691
It's something
they would carry
around with them

62
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,109
for the rest
of their lives.

63
00:02:09,194 --> 00:02:11,312
If you're gonna lead
them to the promised land,

64
00:02:11,396 --> 00:02:13,113
you're gonna have
to have an attitude
adjustment.

65
00:02:13,198 --> 00:02:14,148
(sighs)
But, Will,
they're ready.

66
00:02:14,232 --> 00:02:15,983
You made 'em ready
for three years.

67
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,904
But what if it wasn't enough?

68
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,408
Will, you better
come downstairs.

69
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:25,659
We got a problem.

70
00:02:27,045 --> 00:02:29,380
(kids yelling)

71
00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:33,384
Hey, calm down!
Hey, hey, calm down! Calm down!

72
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:34,585
Fight, fight, fight!

73
00:02:34,636 --> 00:02:35,753
Hey, cool out!

74
00:02:35,804 --> 00:02:37,054
He's studying
for geography

75
00:02:37,121 --> 00:02:38,055
while we're trying
to rehearse! It's bogus!

76
00:02:38,122 --> 00:02:39,506
'Cause I already
know the dance!

77
00:02:39,591 --> 00:02:41,308
You dance like you
got your feet caught
in bear traps.

78
00:02:41,393 --> 00:02:43,126
You're trying
to gnaw them off.

79
00:02:43,178 --> 00:02:44,979
Mr. Shue, are you aware
that while we're arguing
about jazz squares,

80
00:02:45,063 --> 00:02:48,315
Unique is being handed the key
to the city by Rahm Emanuel?
Really?

81
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,068
And plus my pillow and my
blanket fell into the pool.
Disaster.

82
00:02:51,135 --> 00:02:53,303
Look, I think everybody is
just a little tired.

83
00:02:53,355 --> 00:02:54,822
We've been rehearsing
for three straight hours.

84
00:02:54,906 --> 00:02:56,523
Yeah, and we'll rehearse
all night if we have to.

85
00:02:56,608 --> 00:02:57,441
We can rest after we've won!

86
00:02:57,492 --> 00:02:58,975
Just because we've lost Mercedes

87
00:02:59,027 --> 00:03:02,279
doesn't mean we can be anything
less than perfect. Perfect!

88
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,580
That's easy for you to say.

89
00:03:03,648 --> 00:03:05,616
Okay, you know what?
You know what?

90
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:08,919
Hey! I don't want
to hear any of this,
"We can't do it without her,"

91
00:03:08,986 --> 00:03:11,005
because guess what?
We don't have a choice.

92
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:13,457
So be warned:
if you are not giving this

93
00:03:13,508 --> 00:03:15,175
everything you've got,

94
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,961
I will go all
Lima Heights on
your sorry asses.

95
00:03:18,013 --> 00:03:19,096
Listen to yourselves.

96
00:03:19,163 --> 00:03:20,798
I know. I'm sorry.
I always go

97
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:22,683
to the yelling place.
I have rage.

98
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:26,804
No, it's a good thing.
A great thing.

99
00:03:26,855 --> 00:03:29,172
There is so much passion
in this room

100
00:03:29,224 --> 00:03:31,842
Even all your arguing,
it's about the work.

101
00:03:31,893 --> 00:03:33,644
You guys really want this.

102
00:03:33,695 --> 00:03:35,646
Okay, so let's take
a half-hour break,

103
00:03:35,697 --> 00:03:37,398
and then we'll run it
from the top.

104
00:03:37,482 --> 00:03:39,566
Mr. Shue, is it okay
if we keep going? We got

105
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:40,517
the first slot,
which is, like, the death slot.

106
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:41,819
We have to be amazing.

107
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,203
Yeah, "Edge of Glory's"
a bitch.

108
00:03:43,288 --> 00:03:44,521
I said I'd be dancing
by nationals.

109
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:45,789
I'll be damned if I don't.

110
00:03:45,857 --> 00:03:47,023
Okay, then let's
keep going.

111
00:03:47,075 --> 00:03:48,525
Mike, help the guys out
with the choreography.

112
00:03:48,576 --> 00:03:50,160
Artie, help Puck
with his geography.

113
00:03:50,211 --> 00:03:51,962
Ladies, "Edge of Glory."
Come on.

114
00:03:52,029 --> 00:03:53,380
Brittany, run us through it.

115
00:03:53,465 --> 00:03:55,582
From the chorus?
Yeah, from the chorus.
Let's do it.

116
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:58,168
Watch out. We're gonna
do it. Okay. Ready?

117
00:03:58,219 --> 00:03:59,420
Five, six,
seven, eight.

118
00:03:59,504 --> 00:04:02,005
One, two, three, four, five...

119
00:04:02,057 --> 00:04:02,973
You okay?

120
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,374
...six, seven, eight.

121
00:04:04,426 --> 00:04:06,477
One, two, three, four...

122
00:04:06,544 --> 00:04:07,678
Keep up.

123
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:16,070
Looking for what's left
of your dignity?

124
00:04:16,154 --> 00:04:18,555
Nice to see you, too, Jessie.

125
00:04:18,606 --> 00:04:20,891
If I were you, I'd be
spending more time fing

126
00:04:20,942 --> 00:04:22,576
on how you're gonna wrap up
fourth place

127
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,027
than looking for her.

128
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,062
There's no way in hell
Carmen Tibideaux's coming here.

129
00:04:26,114 --> 00:04:27,414
Wait. How do you know
about Carmen?

130
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:28,615
It's my business
to know everything

131
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,750
that goes on with
my competition.

132
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:31,401
I'm always looking
for that extra edge.

133
00:04:31,453 --> 00:04:33,921
I hate to think
you pull the same
choke job up there today.

134
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:35,956
Look, I know exactly what
you're doing right now, okay?

135
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,574
We didn't date for that long,

136
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,076
and I don't even know how much
of it was actually real,

137
00:04:40,128 --> 00:04:41,879
but when you get nervous,
you get mean

138
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:44,131
and you get really pale,
and then you start putting
your hands

139
00:04:44,215 --> 00:04:45,599
through your hair
like Danny Zuko.

140
00:04:45,683 --> 00:04:47,935
Look, you have no idea
the kind of pressure
I'm under.

141
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:51,271
Last year, Vocal Adrenaline
only lost for the first time
in eight years.

142
00:04:51,356 --> 00:04:54,257
If we lose again
this year, that's it.
The dynasty is over.

143
00:04:54,309 --> 00:04:58,145
The mystique and aura
that we used to intimidate
our opponents with will vanish.

144
00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:01,448
I promised them that
I would reboot the program.
I'll be humiliated.

145
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:02,816
You did help the program.

146
00:05:02,901 --> 00:05:04,267
What you did with
Unique was amazing.

147
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:06,537
It was a pretty
inspired idea of mine.

148
00:05:06,604 --> 00:05:08,906
It was actually Kurt's
and Mercedes', but...

149
00:05:08,957 --> 00:05:11,492
But I implemented it.

150
00:05:11,576 --> 00:05:13,610
I don't know. I just think
these new rules are

151
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:16,747
messing with my head; 33%

152
00:05:16,798 --> 00:05:19,550
of the numbers have
to be vintage? What does
that even mean?

153
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:22,302
The only thing vintage
about me is my Tyrone Powers
haircut and my pager.

154
00:05:22,387 --> 00:05:24,421
Are you forgetting who you are,
Jesse, okay?

155
00:05:24,472 --> 00:05:26,590
<i>Your Bohemian Rhapsody was,
like, the benchmark performance</i>

156
00:05:26,641 --> 00:05:29,343
of every show choir
competition in the
past ten years.

157
00:05:29,427 --> 00:05:31,178
Most people don't realize

158
00:05:31,262 --> 00:05:32,896
I lost ten pounds
during that performance.

159
00:05:32,964 --> 00:05:34,264
You guys are
gonna do great today.

160
00:05:34,315 --> 00:05:36,984
Even though we're
definitely gonna beat you.

161
00:05:37,068 --> 00:05:39,319
Oh, cocky all of a sudden.

162
00:05:39,404 --> 00:05:41,104
I like it.

163
00:05:41,156 --> 00:05:42,639
Hey, everything okay?

164
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,409
Yeah, everything's good.
I'm gonna go get ready.

165
00:05:45,476 --> 00:05:47,528
It was very good to see you.
You, too.

166
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:49,997
Hi.

167
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:51,147
Heard you two are getting
married.

168
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,983
Yeah.

169
00:05:53,034 --> 00:05:55,919
Good for you.

170
00:05:55,987 --> 00:05:59,006
Good luck today.

171
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,040
You, too.

172
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:07,931
For me?
Well, it's for the wedding.

173
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:10,834
For the Jewish part
where you smash the glass.
It'ske, the climax

174
00:06:10,885 --> 00:06:12,269
of the wedding, right?
Right before we kiss?

175
00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:13,820
Yeah, it's supposed to symbolize
the fragility of life

176
00:06:13,888 --> 00:06:15,472
or the destruction of the temple

177
00:06:15,523 --> 00:06:17,340
or something like that.
It's very sweet.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

178
00:06:17,392 --> 00:06:20,227
But whatever. I wanted
a piece of this town
to be there.

179
00:06:20,311 --> 00:06:22,029
This is the town where
everything's gonna change.

180
00:06:22,113 --> 00:06:24,314
We're gonna go from losers
to National Champs.

181
00:06:24,365 --> 00:06:26,900
Your optimism if very sexy.

182
00:06:26,985 --> 00:06:29,987
Well, I'm so optimistic, I put
my money where my mouth is.

183
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:31,655
You want to bet me

184
00:06:31,706 --> 00:06:33,657
that your dork club is gonna
outdork all the other

185
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,142
dork clubs
in the country?

186
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,460
500 bucks.

187
00:06:36,527 --> 00:06:38,412
You're so on.

188
00:06:38,496 --> 00:06:40,214
Wait a minute.
That money was supposed

189
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:41,715
to be for our honeymoon, okay?

190
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:44,084
It was our money that we saved
from babysitting

191
00:06:44,168 --> 00:06:46,003
and the tips you made
at the tire shop!

192
00:06:46,054 --> 00:06:48,338
I'm gonna double it. I'm gonna
make it a thousand dollars.

193
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:50,373
That's, like, an extra
two nights in Niagara Falls.

194
00:06:50,425 --> 00:06:51,925
What if we lose?
Not this time.

195
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,178
Carmen Tibideaux is coming,
and we're gonna be perfect.

196
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,147
And then we're
gonna get married,

197
00:06:57,214 --> 00:06:58,565
and I'm gonna smash this glass,

198
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,067
and then we're gonna live
happily ever after.

199
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:02,886
I love you.

200
00:07:11,562 --> 00:07:12,696
All right, gather around,
everyone!

201
00:07:12,747 --> 00:07:14,064
(kids cheer)

202
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:17,084
I just want to say a few words
before we go out there.

203
00:07:17,168 --> 00:07:19,286
Hold on, Mr. Shue. Hold on.
You've given us

204
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,672
a lot of pep talks
over the years, but remember,

205
00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:23,290
you told us once
that, you know,

206
00:07:23,374 --> 00:07:28,078
a teacher's job is done when his
students don't need him anymore?

207
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:32,883
Okay. Finn, the floor is yours.

208
00:07:32,934 --> 00:07:35,052
Last night we all sat around
in a circle

209
00:07:35,103 --> 00:07:37,087
after you went to bed
and we told stories.

210
00:07:37,138 --> 00:07:38,855
But then we went around
the room,

211
00:07:38,923 --> 00:07:41,441
and everybody said what they
wanted to win this thing for,

212
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:43,310
and we all said the same thing:

213
00:07:43,394 --> 00:07:45,696
we want to win this for you.
Yeah.

214
00:07:45,763 --> 00:07:47,981
And I know every year at school
Figgins gives away

215
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:50,767
the Teacher of the Year award.

216
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:53,203
But I don't think
any of us have to wait

217
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,271
to see how we feel about that.

218
00:07:55,323 --> 00:07:57,991
You're, like, our
Teacher of a Lifetime.

219
00:07:58,076 --> 00:07:58,959
GIRL:
Yeah.

220
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:00,994
Whoo!
Yeah, definitely.

221
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,279
Thank you, Finn, all of you.

222
00:08:03,331 --> 00:08:04,631
I love you guys so much.

223
00:08:04,716 --> 00:08:06,616
(over P.A.)
New Directions, line up.

224
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:09,119
All right, that's it.
Show time. Hands in, everyone.

225
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,805
Now I know you weren't planning
on doing the show circle

226
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:13,390
without me.
Mercedes?

227
00:08:13,457 --> 00:08:14,591
You're alive!

228
00:08:14,642 --> 00:08:16,226
Yeah, thanks to Sue.
She's a miracle worker.

229
00:08:16,293 --> 00:08:18,061
Oh, well, it's amazing
what a little TLC,

230
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:20,296
some cortisone
and a witch doctor will do.

231
00:08:20,348 --> 00:08:22,232
Thank God you're okay
because that just means

232
00:08:22,299 --> 00:08:23,900
I'm not gonna fall on my face

233
00:08:23,968 --> 00:08:24,935
during that Trouble Tones
number.

234
00:08:24,986 --> 00:08:26,236
Oh, screw that.

235
00:08:26,303 --> 00:08:27,971
This is our last time
performing together.

236
00:08:28,022 --> 00:08:29,906
You're doing it,
and so you are you, Tina.

237
00:08:29,974 --> 00:08:31,808
I'm not taking no
for an answer.

238
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:34,477
Plus I have so many steroids
going through my body right now,

239
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:37,030
I may turn into the Incredible
Hulk if you piss me off.

240
00:08:37,115 --> 00:08:39,199
Okay, if we don't get out
of this room soon,

241
00:08:39,283 --> 00:08:42,285
none of us will be performing.
Let's go!

242
00:08:42,337 --> 00:08:43,203
Go, New Directions!

243

244
00:08:47,786 --> 00:08:49,137
Dick Butkus,
I beg of you,

245
00:08:49,222 --> 00:08:50,806
chew your cud with
your mouth closed.

246
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:54,810
Sorry. I'm as nervous
as a cat in a room full
of rocking chairs.

247
00:08:54,894 --> 00:08:58,263
Think how you'd feel
if your entire teaching
career were riding on this.

248
00:08:58,314 --> 00:09:00,965
Okay?

249
00:09:01,017 --> 00:09:03,134
(sighs) I really wish
we weren't going first.

250
00:09:03,186 --> 00:09:05,320
The kids are right,
it's the death slot.

251
00:09:05,404 --> 00:09:07,639
Carmen Tibideaux isn't here,
Mercedes still has a fever.

252

567

I have a confession
to make.

568
00:25:27,932 --> 00:25:30,033
I am a show choir junkie.

569
00:25:30,101 --> 00:25:31,401
Some people
follow football;

570
00:25:31,452 --> 00:25:34,270
some people follow the NCAA
basketball tournament;

571
00:25:34,322 --> 00:25:36,373
some people follow
the daily goings-on

572
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,774
in the life of their
wife and children.

573
00:25:37,825 --> 00:25:40,994
Not me. I follow competitive
high school show choir.

574
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:42,796
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh, my God!

575
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,115
Seriously?
Did you blog just about me

576
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:46,116
during that performance?

577
00:25:48,836 --> 00:25:51,088
You're welcome. It's already
got over three million hits.

578
00:25:51,139 --> 00:25:53,957
And secondly,
if you don't love show choir,

579
00:25:54,008 --> 00:25:56,459
then what exactly are you
doing here, Lindsay Lohan?

580
00:25:56,511 --> 00:25:57,644
If you have to ask

581
00:25:57,729 --> 00:26:00,514
why a 12-time Teen Choice Award
nominee

582
00:26:00,598 --> 00:26:02,232
is a celebrity judge,

583
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:05,235

what the word celebrity means.

And I'm here, Perez,

586
00:26:08,106 --> 00:26:10,023

about young artists

587
00:26:10,108 --> 00:26:11,641
chasing their impossible dreams.

588
00:26:11,693 --> 00:26:12,826
I know them.

589
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,828
I feel them.
I was them.

590
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,646
So, I'm here to support them
unconditionally.

Let's get down to business.

593
00:26:19,117 --> 00:26:21,418

The New Directions.

603

They had so much energy.
It was awesome.

604
00:26:44,058 --> 00:26:47,177
Oh, but gosh, last year
in New York, they choked.

605
00:26:47,228 --> 00:26:48,862
They didn't even
crack the top ten.

606
00:26:48,946 --> 00:26:52,182
I liked them, but they weren't
the best singers and dancers.

607
00:26:52,233 --> 00:26:52,983
They are likable.

608
00:26:53,034 --> 00:26:54,651
And is there anything better

609
00:26:54,702 --> 00:26:56,203
than someone making a comeback?

610
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,854

611
00:26:57,905 --> 00:26:59,189
Please.

612
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,124
The New Directions
were horrible.

613
00:27:01,192 --> 00:27:02,375
Jim Steinman should
never be allowed

614
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,827
to write another song again.

615
00:27:03,878 --> 00:27:05,746
I'm for Vocal Adrenaline
all the way.

616
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:08,215
I think
that Unique kid is a star.

617
00:27:08,299 --> 00:27:11,218

621
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,540

625
00:27:22,213 --> 00:27:24,514
This isn't televised.

626
00:27:24,565 --> 00:27:25,565
What?

627
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,651

629
00:27:30,104 --> 00:27:32,388
I show up here and there's
not even a red button to push?

630
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,274
And a chair that can
spin me around?

631
00:27:34,358 --> 00:27:37,160
Or I can then point
at a kid onstage and yell,
"I would work with you!"

632
00:27:37,228 --> 00:27:39,913
Really? I'm seriously
firing my manager.

633
00:27:39,997 --> 00:27:40,947
Can I use that as an exclusive?

634
00:27:41,032 --> 00:27:42,032
Absolutely not.

635
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:43,667

McKinley is having a very
special event tomorrow,

00:35:54,063 --> 00:35:55,180

763
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,932
New Directions
singing group perform.

764
00:35:56,983 --> 00:35:58,466
Yeah, we'd love to.

765
00:35:58,517 --> 00:36:00,101
Yeah. Absolutely.

766
00:36:00,152 --> 00:36:01,486
What kind of special event?

767
00:36:03,406 --> 00:36:05,357
Can you keep a secret?

00:36:05,382 --> 00:36:05,382
+++++

769
00:36:10,004 --> 00:36:11,304
Ok. Much better.
Ok.

770
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,000
So much better.
So handsome.

771
00:36:13,025 --> 00:36:14,225
And now we're free.

772
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,450

00:36:15,475 --> 00:36:16,675
(laughs)

774
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,900
(sighs) Hey.

775
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:20,725
Thank you.

776
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,150
My pleasure.

777
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:24,575
Literally.

778
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,500
I just thought you know,
my man is a winner

779
00:36:28,525 --> 00:36:30,825
and he deserves to
be treated as such.

780
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:33,950
And it was as much for
me as it was for you.

781
00:36:33,975 --> 00:36:36,675
(laughs)
Last night was...

782
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,200
well worth the wait.

783
00:36:38,925 --> 00:36:40,925
But I meant thank you
for everything.

784
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,750
This whole year,
it's been incredible.

785
00:36:44,575 --> 00:36:47,475
And I'm so grateful to
have you by my side.

786
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,300
Many more years to come.

787
00:36:52,525 --> 00:36:54,625
SUE:
Award ceremony's
about to start.

788
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:59,350
Lots of competition for
teacher of the year.

789
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:01,375
My source, and when
I say my source I mean

790
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,900
Becky Jackson hiding in
a dummy filing cabinet

791
00:37:03,925 --> 00:37:05,225
that I put in
Figgin's office.

792
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,950
My source said Sue
Sylvester make room

793
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,775
in your trophy case
for yet another accolade.

794
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,200
Let us review why.

795
00:37:12,225 --> 00:37:16,325
I led your tragic band of misfits
 to a victory at nationals.

796
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:18,450
I defeated my
Nubian nemesis.

797
00:37:18,475 --> 00:37:21,875
And of course the Cherrios
welcomed me back with open arms.

798
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,600
And I did all of this without
missing a single day of work

799
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:26,925
and in spite of the fact
that I've been pregnant now

800
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,750
for indeterminate
number of months.

801
00:37:29,075 --> 00:37:31,475
Sue.
I've gotta give you your due.

802
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,700
No question you helped
us win Nationals

803
00:37:33,725 --> 00:37:35,225
and I know you've had
a tough year but you

804
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,450
never gave up.

805
00:37:36,475 --> 00:37:38,075
You do deserve this.

806
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,300
Thank you William.

807
00:37:39,325 --> 00:37:41,225
Truer words never came
out of your mouth.

808
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,450
(laughs)
Shall we?

809
00:37:42,475 --> 00:37:43,675
Yea.

810
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,400
Why do you look
different?

811
00:37:48,025 --> 00:37:52,225
MRS HAGBERG:
I'd like to thank you all
for forty years of memories

812
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,450
here at McKinley

813
00:37:53,475 --> 00:37:56,575
and I plan on using my
retirement to finally

814
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,800
kick my addiction
to painkillers.

815
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:04,325
A reminder that my
episode of Intervention

816
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,850
airs at the end
of June

817
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:10,075
and my Hoarders episode
airs in early August.

818
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,800
Thank you for your support.

819
00:38:11,825 --> 00:38:15,825

820
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,850

830
00:38:45,938 --> 00:38:48,973
The 2012 William
McKinley High School

831
00:38:49,058 --> 00:38:50,775
Teacher of the Year Award
goes to...

832
00:38:53,863 --> 00:38:55,280
Mr. Will Schuester!

833
00:38:55,364 --> 00:38:57,315
Yeah!
(cheering)

834
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,770
Way to go, buddy.

835
00:39:07,543 --> 00:39:08,993
Wait, just, uh...

836
00:39:09,078 --> 00:39:11,045
before you come up
to accept the award,

837
00:39:11,113 --> 00:39:13,081
we just wanted
to say a few things.

838
00:39:13,132 --> 00:39:14,966
Uh...

839
00:39:16,385 --> 00:39:19,671
Three years ago,
I thought I had it all.

840
00:39:19,755 --> 00:39:21,839
I was the quarterback of
the football team,

841
00:39:21,924 --> 00:39:23,892
I was dating
the head cheerleader.

842
00:39:23,959 --> 00:39:25,927
And then I met you, Mr. Shue,

843
00:39:25,978 --> 00:39:27,478
and I realized
everything I was missing.

844
00:39:27,563 --> 00:39:31,566
There's a lot of great teachers
at this school,

845
00:39:31,633 --> 00:39:33,935
who teach their students
a lot of important stuff,

846
00:39:33,986 --> 00:39:35,353
like how to drive
and-and fractions...

847
00:39:39,525 --> 00:39:43,328
...but you teach your students
how to dream.

848
00:39:43,412 --> 00:39:44,645
As far as I'm concerned,

849
00:39:44,697 --> 00:39:46,030
there's nothing more
important than that.

850
00:39:52,521 --> 00:39:54,722
Mr. Shue...

851
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,224
when I first met you,

852
00:39:56,292 --> 00:39:57,892
I was just an
annoying Jewish girl

853
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,727
with two gay dads
and a very big dream.

854
00:39:59,795 --> 00:40:02,247
Today...

855
00:40:02,314 --> 00:40:04,933
I still have two dads,
and I'm still Jewish,

856
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,136
and I'm probably
just as annoying, but...

857
00:40:08,187 --> 00:40:11,723
I stand before you
headed to New York City

858
00:40:11,807 --> 00:40:13,174
come hell or high water

859
00:40:13,225 --> 00:40:15,476
and, um, I can honestly say

860
00:40:15,527 --> 00:40:17,145
that I couldn't have
done it without you,

861
00:40:17,196 --> 00:40:21,515
and I will carry you
every step of the way, so...

862
00:40:21,567 --> 00:40:23,284
Congratulations.

863
00:40:23,352 --> 00:40:24,702
Um... no one deserves this
more than you.

864
