1
00:01:38,781 --> 00:01:42,239
All right, Chinatown. Let's go to
Chinatown and the Bowery.

2
00:01:42,418 --> 00:01:47,617
- Just leaving. A trip through Chinatown.
- Go away. Go away.

3
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:50,883
Here, here! Tonight's the night, folks.
Tonight's the night!

4
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,550
It's wedding night at Dawnland.

5
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:59,134
We're not only giving away the bride but
four rooms of furniture and $50 cash!

6
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,599
This way to the bridal night
at Dawnland.

7
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:31,056
Miss Martin, meet up with Mr. Jones.

8
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,066
Go on.

9
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,695
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my privilege to officiate...

10
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:41,173
...at another one of Dawnland's
weekly happy events.

11
00:02:41,344 --> 00:02:43,869
Through the courtesy
of the Dawnland Ballroom...

12
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:47,483
...many a young couple has embarked
successfully on the sea of matrimony.

13
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,947
- Johnny.
- Yes, sir?

14
00:02:49,118 --> 00:02:52,019
There's a guy been here
looking for your partner.

15
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,589
- Where is he?
- He said he'd be back.

16
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,794
You better scrape up some dough,
or he'll take your pal's suit.

17
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:02,625
- Yeah?
- Better put on your number...

18
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:06,064
...before he shows up again,
or it might turn into a striptease.

19
00:03:06,235 --> 00:03:08,032
Yes, sir.

20
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:14,138
- Now, look, King...
- Wait, Johnny. Let me speak.

21
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,802
I had a chance to get rid of a girl,
so I saw her off on the train.

22
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:20,506
Yeah? It was your turn
to call for the bride.

23
00:03:20,683 --> 00:03:22,651
This is the third time
I've covered for you.

24
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:25,049
Okay. I'm sorry.
I'll take the next three.

25
00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:30,181
- Who do you love?
- You, you silly... Go on. What a guy.

26
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,828
And we came to New York
to get on Broadway.

27
00:03:32,996 --> 00:03:37,592
- At least we're in the right town.
- Yeah, but who knows it except us?

28
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:41,897
Just a couple of taxi dancers, pushing
around a lot of female lonely-hearts...

29
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:44,869
...at 5 cents a dance.
And doing a specialty act...

30
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:50,206
...without pay. What a career.
- You don't feel like going on, do you?

31
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,678
Oh, sure. I can hardly wait.

32
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:57,115
If there's anything I enjoy,
it's doing a specialty for no dough.

33
00:03:57,286 --> 00:04:00,312
And all those agents you keep telling
me about being in to see us.

34
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:05,723
I suppose they'll all be out there.
Agents love to come to a dump like this.

35
00:04:05,895 --> 00:04:08,625
They expect to find so much.

36
00:04:08,798 --> 00:04:11,995
All right,
suppose we don't go on tonight?

37
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:15,604
Yeah. You're getting more and more
discouraged all the time.

38
00:04:15,772 --> 00:04:19,037
You're letting the act down,
and that's no good, King.

39
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:22,177
Say, listen, we may never get anywhere,
but if we don't think so...

40
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:26,179
- I'd rather break it up now.
- Well, maybe I'm weakening.

41
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:30,342
Maybe I'm holding you back.
Maybe you ought to get another partner.

42
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,681
Maybe you're right.

43
00:04:35,491 --> 00:04:37,459
Who you gonna get?

44
00:04:37,927 --> 00:04:41,260
- Bill Sanderson.
- Bill's a good boy...

45
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:45,333
...if you can still call him a boy.
He's been around a long time.

46
00:04:45,935 --> 00:04:48,802
Hey, that's us. Come on.
We'll give these people a show.

47
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:50,939
- Okay, boy.
- And remember, you never know...

48
00:04:51,107 --> 00:04:53,837
...who may be out there. So give!
- Right.

49
00:04:56,412 --> 00:05:00,906
We now give you that talented
dance team, Shaw and Brett.

50
00:05:01,084 --> 00:05:04,019
Let's give them a big hand.

51
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,428
Wait a minute. That's all.
Always leave them wanting.

52
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:42,293
He's wonderful! He's sensational!
He, he, he, he's good, isn't he?

53
00:08:42,638 --> 00:08:44,538
I like singers, Mr. Casey.

54
00:08:44,707 --> 00:08:47,267
Oh, you do? You like singers,
Mr. Casey.

55
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:53,575
Listen, Pearl, he's... I can see it:
Casey and Matthews Present...

56
00:08:53,749 --> 00:08:57,480
...whatever his name is. I'll show
Matthews who's the brains of this firm.

57
00:08:57,653 --> 00:09:02,317
Why, this is the greatest discovery
of my life. I'll... Here, boy.

58
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:04,652
- Was you addressing me?
- Yes.

59
00:09:04,827 --> 00:09:07,955
I wanted to talk to that young man
who was just dancing here.

60
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,894
You know, the one on the end there.
It's important business.

61
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:13,695
- Please get him right away, will you?
- Sure.

62
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:17,100
Thank you. Now, you see why
I come to a place like this?

63
00:09:17,273 --> 00:09:19,036
You never can tell where talent hides.

64
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:24,439
It's apt to be in the lowest konky-tonk,
konk, tonky... The lowest dive.

65
00:09:24,613 --> 00:09:29,641
I wish you wouldn't keep rubbing
that cape, it... You'll wear it out.

66
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,185
There's a gent outside
wants to see one of you guys.

67
00:09:32,355 --> 00:09:35,153
- An agent!
- Sit down. Be right out.

68
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:38,157
Come on! What are you waiting for?
The guy's liable to get away!

69
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,852
That's no agent. Look at that.

70
00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:45,796
- Got any dough?
- Not enough.

71
00:09:45,968 --> 00:09:48,801
Suit, you're about to return
to your maker.

72
00:09:48,971 --> 00:09:51,132
Wait a minute. Wait here.

73
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,703
- Hey, young man, you!
- Me?

74
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,815
- Yes. Where have you been hiding?
- Where have you been looking?

75
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:04,214
Everywhere! I, no, that isn't...
What's your name?

76
00:10:04,387 --> 00:10:08,847
- King Shaw.
- King Shaw. I must remember that.

77
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:13,988
I'll be right back. Here... You...

78
00:10:14,163 --> 00:10:19,624
- Come on, don't high-hat me, sister.
- Okay, brother, no hard feelings. Shake.

79
00:10:19,802 --> 00:10:21,269
Sure.

80
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,275
I once knew the cutest little
Japanese banker.

81
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,702
- Well?
- I just saved your life.

82
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,678
- I told him I was you.
- Why are you me?

83
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:36,647
Because if a guy had a summons
for King Shaw...

84
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:39,413
...and handed it to Johnny Brett,
it wouldn't be legal.

85
00:10:39,588 --> 00:10:41,579
Say, why didn't we think
of that before?

86
00:10:41,757 --> 00:10:46,751
If you'd stop trying to corner the market
on blonds, we might keep the suit.

87
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:48,590
Are you sneaking out again tonight?

88
00:10:48,764 --> 00:10:53,133
Come on, come clean. Tell Kingsie.
Where do you go every night?

89
00:10:53,302 --> 00:10:58,171
- I've told you, I take dancing lessons.
- Dancing lessons. Who is she?

90
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,333
Why, King, I'm surprised at you.
Would I let a girl get under my skin?

91
00:11:02,511 --> 00:11:05,639
Do you think I could be charmed
by a smile or a pretty face?

92
00:11:05,815 --> 00:11:07,510
Look at me.
Am I the kind of a guy...

93
00:11:07,683 --> 00:11:11,517
...a woman can twist around her
little finger? Now I ask you, am I?

94
00:11:11,687 --> 00:11:15,179
- I don't know, are you?
- I certainly am.

95
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:31,767
Good evening.

96
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:05,874
Oh, sorry.

97
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,114
So sorry, sir.

98
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:30,094
- Your hat, sir.
- Oh, no.

99
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:38,771
Thank you.

100
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:41,846
- Good night, George.
- Good night, Johnny.

101
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:52,184
Hello.

102
00:16:53,228 --> 00:16:54,627
Come in.

103
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:58,164
Well, well, hello.
Hello. Busy?

104
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,460
No, no, Casey.
We're holding open house.

105
00:17:00,636 --> 00:17:03,332
- Oh, that's fine.
- Clare, darling.

106
00:17:03,505 --> 00:17:05,871
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to catch the show tonight.

107
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,635
I'm sure that Bert saw to it
everything went all right.

108
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:11,439
- Everything didn't go all right.
- You can use good news...

109
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,081
...and I've got it.
I've got a great surprise for you.

110
00:17:14,249 --> 00:17:20,449
It's... Oh, no, it's not you.
Excuse me. This is Miss Pearl Delange.

111
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:21,884
- How do you do?
- Hello.

112
00:17:22,057 --> 00:17:25,424
Bert, our troubles are over. I made
the greatest discovery of my life.

113
00:17:25,594 --> 00:17:29,030
Just what we've been hoping for.
I have found Clare's new partner.

114
00:17:29,198 --> 00:17:31,894
- Well, what's his name?
- Well, I wrote it down. Here it is...

115
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:36,561
...Peggy Britton, Columbus 6...
Oh, no, that's something else.

116
00:17:36,738 --> 00:17:40,538
- King Shaw. Wait till you see him.
- King Shaw? Never heard of him!

117
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:43,803
- Well, you will, Bert. You will.
- We've got to have a name, Casey!

118
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,140
Clare didn't have a name
when I discovered her!

119
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,976
- Why, I certainly did.
- What?

120
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,983
- Bridget Callahan.
- Yes, that's right.

121
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:55,112
And what were you? Nothing
but a great big baritone when...

122
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,622
When I told you how to fix
the second act of your show.

123
00:17:57,793 --> 00:18:01,058
Yes. No! Well, you did...
It was just a suggestion.

124
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,027
You made a fortune
out of that suggestion.

125
00:18:03,198 --> 00:18:05,530
There's gratitude.
Didn't I make you my partner?

126
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:08,033
- Well, you needed a young man...
- What?

127
00:18:08,203 --> 00:18:09,761
- You were getting old.
- Old?

128
00:18:12,507 --> 00:18:16,136
My hair was as white as it is now
when I was 17, 15...

129
00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:17,835
...well, I was pretty young.

130
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,709
- Bob, he's just jealous of you.
- Of course he is.

131
00:18:20,883 --> 00:18:22,817
When are we going to see
your discovery?

132
00:18:22,985 --> 00:18:25,476
I'll have him in Bert's office
tomorrow morning at 11:00.

133
00:18:25,654 --> 00:18:28,555
Come on, Pearl, darling.
Let's take this home.

134
00:18:28,724 --> 00:18:31,784
It's been so nice
having this little chat with you.

135
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,056
Yes. Well, come on,
my little chatterbox.

136
00:18:39,735 --> 00:18:42,670
I think you get more people back here
than we get out front.

137
00:18:42,838 --> 00:18:44,897
Oh, I'm sorry
you were interrupted, Bert.

138
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,435
Tell me something.
Why do you always propose...

139
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:49,509
...three days before
the close of a show?

140
00:18:49,845 --> 00:18:51,540
I mean to do it
at the end of the run...

141
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,408
How much do you really
want to marry me?

142
00:18:53,682 --> 00:18:55,547
More than anything in the world.

143
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,275
Bert...

144
00:18:57,986 --> 00:19:01,422
- I'd hate to give up my career.
- Yeah.

145
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,024
What are you talking about?
The new show's written.

146
00:19:04,192 --> 00:19:07,559
You've got a contract with me.
You can't walk out on a contract!

147
00:19:08,263 --> 00:19:10,458
Say, what are you doing, kidding me?

148
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,893
I'm just trying to prove
that the theater is your real love...

149
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,264
...and I guess the same thing
goes for me.

150
00:19:17,205 --> 00:19:23,007
- Yeah. That means no, huh?
- Well, let's say it doesn't mean yes.

151
00:19:29,117 --> 00:19:32,052
Keep the motor running. I may
have trouble getting my cape back.

152
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,517
Yes, sir.

153
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:35,782
You certainly have been nice to me,
Mr. Casey.

154
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,017
- Oh, well, I...
- I mean, about this cape.

155
00:19:38,193 --> 00:19:41,162
- Oh, well...
- I hope you won't misunderstand.

156
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,525
- I mean, about my accepting it.
- Oh, no.

157
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:46,259
Well, I hope
you won't misunderstand either.

158
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:50,872
Oh, no! Why, I think people
can be platonic and still be friends.

159
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,802
- Good night, Mr. Casey.
- Just a minute!

160
00:19:52,975 --> 00:19:54,943
Aren't you forgetting something?

161
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,741
Does Mr. Casey mean
his little night-night kiss?

162
00:20:00,148 --> 00:20:03,914
Yes.
That's just what I mean.

163
00:20:04,186 --> 00:20:09,681
It's been a lovely evening, Mr. Casey.
Thanks for everything.

164
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:13,357
Oh, Mr. Casey!

165
00:20:14,896 --> 00:20:18,957
I understand about the cape.
No hard feelings. Shake?

166
00:20:19,434 --> 00:20:23,302
Oh, well, that's big of you, Pearl.

167
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:28,933
Oh, you knew the cutest little
Japanese banker.

168
00:20:29,111 --> 00:20:32,945
Come on! Drive like the wind!

169
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:44,655
Come and get it!

170
00:20:45,861 --> 00:20:49,160
Hey, King! Wake up!

171
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,667
Nice black coffee for that nice
black hangover.

172
00:20:57,305 --> 00:21:00,399
Oh, Johnny. Johnny.
Don't, don't, Johnny.

173
00:21:00,575 --> 00:21:03,373
Oh, I think I swallowed a cactus
last night.

174
00:21:03,545 --> 00:21:05,877
Here, drown it with this.

175
00:21:08,116 --> 00:21:10,914
Quit pushing, will you?
It's those little men again.

176
00:21:11,086 --> 00:21:13,418
Here, I'll handle the cup, Johnny.

177
00:21:13,755 --> 00:21:17,885
- Sure you got everything you need?
- Everything except my health.

178
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,323
Hey, where are you going?

179
00:21:20,495 --> 00:21:23,692
Matthews and Casey have a new show.
I just thought I'd drop by.

180
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,696
I'll save you a trip.
Nothing's there.

181
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:29,098
- How do you know?
- Never has been. There never is.

182
00:21:29,271 --> 00:21:31,831
- There never will be. Amen.
- Yeah?

183
00:21:32,007 --> 00:21:33,702
Listen to this:

184
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,935
"Turner and Farrell got a specialty
spot in the new Cole Porter show.

185
00:21:37,112 --> 00:21:39,603
What's more, they worked it up
to three and a half minutes."

186
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:43,046
Yeah? Well, Turner must be
the manager's uncle...

187
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,448
...and Farrell must know where
the body's hidden.

188
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:49,750
Well, maybe I can find a body.
So long.

189
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:52,351
Hey, Johnny.

190
00:21:52,527 --> 00:21:56,554
When you come back,
do me a favor, huh? Don't stamp.

191
00:21:56,731 --> 00:22:01,532
- I'm in a very delicate condition.
- Sure.

192
00:22:16,284 --> 00:22:18,081
Speak.

193
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:22,713
Is this King Shaw? This is Casey
and Matthews of Matthews and Casey.

194
00:22:22,891 --> 00:22:27,624
Oh, yeah? Well, this is
Shaw and Brett of Brett and Shaw.

195
00:22:27,796 --> 00:22:30,959
Say, quit kidding me, will you, Johnny?

196
00:22:31,566 --> 00:22:36,765
Hey, as long as you're still downstairs,
send up a pack of cigarettes, huh?

197
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:40,135
What are you talking about?
You've got the wrong number!

198
00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:43,402
I mean, this is Casey and Matthews.
Are you King Shaw?

199
00:22:43,645 --> 00:22:49,083
Matthews and Casey? Oh, gosh!
I'm sorry! Yes, sir. I'll be right over.

200
00:22:49,251 --> 00:22:54,655
And ask for Mr. Matthews.
That's my junior partner. Yeah.

201
00:22:54,823 --> 00:22:58,122
- How did the cape gag work last night?
- What do you mean, gag?

202
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:00,523
I always tell them I'm going to
take the cape back.

203
00:23:00,695 --> 00:23:04,825
After they wasted an evening with you.
You wear out 50 blonds to one cape.

204
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,731
- Do you think it needs a new lining?
- You both do.

205
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:10,562
Why don't you ever take me out?

206
00:23:10,739 --> 00:23:12,934
Maybe you haven't looked at me.
I'm blond.

207
00:23:13,108 --> 00:23:16,236
Well, the cape wouldn't fit you.

208
00:23:16,411 --> 00:23:19,471
Well, if you took me out to supper
a lot, I could grow into it.

209
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:23,812
Well... No, I don't think
you'd look well in it.

210
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,976
I'd look better in it
than you do with it.

211
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:29,885
Well, that's beside the... Here.
That's all. We'll...

212
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:34,017
There's a lady in the reception room
waiting to see you.

213
00:23:34,262 --> 00:23:37,698
Oh, really? What's she like?
I mean, who is she?

214
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:40,800
- Pearl Delange.
- Well, ask her to... Pearl Delange!

215
00:23:40,969 --> 00:23:44,234
And is she sizzling! I think she's out
trapping ermine. I'll bring her in.

216
00:23:44,406 --> 00:23:47,398
No, you'll do nothing of the sort, Amy!
Tell her I can't see her.

217
00:23:47,576 --> 00:23:50,010
I can't see anybody!
I'm busy!

218
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,874
Tell Mr. Matthews that
I've gone to the Pelham Golf Club.

219
00:23:53,048 --> 00:23:56,484
No, better make it the Westchester
Golf Club. It's further away.

220
00:23:57,452 --> 00:24:00,182
Johnny Brett of Shaw and Brett.
Any chance of seeing Mr. Matthews?

221
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,585
He hasn't come in yet.

222
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:12,194
- Hello.
- Hello.

223
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,767
And what do you do?

224
00:24:14,936 --> 00:24:18,030
- I'm a juggler.
- A good one?

225
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:21,664
- Yeah, sure.
- Since when?

226
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,908
- Hello, Dan.
- Hello, Johnny.

227
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,478
- Been the rounds?
- Just starting.

228
00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:27,512
Me too.

229
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,551
Do you see what I see?

230
00:25:01,716 --> 00:25:03,775
Now you do it.

231
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:06,414
I only do it with plates.

232
00:25:39,521 --> 00:25:42,615
Good! Very good.

233
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,154
Now you throw it to me.

234
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,601
You're a big boy now.

235
00:27:42,043 --> 00:27:46,241
Mr. Casey interviews all juggling acts.
Come on, Clare.

236
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,179
- Miss Bennett.
- Good morning.

237
00:27:50,351 --> 00:27:51,613
- Mr. Matthews.
- Good morning.

238
00:27:51,786 --> 00:27:54,277
- Can't see anyone today.
- Fine.

239
00:27:56,991 --> 00:27:59,425
- Mr. Matthews can't see anybody today.
- I wonder if...

240
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:02,154
That goes for all of you.

241
00:28:18,046 --> 00:28:20,742
Say, sister, did my partner,
Johnny Brett, go in there?

242
00:28:20,915 --> 00:28:24,817
- No, he went out there. Good day.
- You mean he left?

243
00:28:24,986 --> 00:28:27,454
Yes. Yes, why don't you join him?

244
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:30,716
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, sister.
I'm King Shaw.

245
00:28:30,892 --> 00:28:34,794
- Okay, King, abdicate.
- Okay, I'll do that.

246
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,727
Casey just phoned and
said Matthews is waiting to see me...

247
00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:40,094
...but I'll take your advice.
Thanks, sister.

248
00:28:40,268 --> 00:28:42,532
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?

249
00:28:42,704 --> 00:28:44,501
You're talking. I'm listening.

250
00:28:48,209 --> 00:28:52,043
- Mr. Shaw to see Mr. Matthews.
- <i>Well, send him in!</i>

251
00:28:52,213 --> 00:28:53,703
Yes, sir.

252
00:29:01,256 --> 00:29:03,622
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Shaw.

253
00:29:05,426 --> 00:29:08,452
- This is Miss Clare Bennett.
- Miss Benne...

254
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,295
- As if I didn't know.
- How are you, Mr. Shaw?

255
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:15,835
I caught your last show in Chicago.
You were very good, very good.

256
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:19,405
- Oh, I'm glad you liked me.
- Sit down, Mr. Shaw. Sit down.

257
00:29:19,941 --> 00:29:22,933
Sure, thanks...
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry. Here, I've got it.

258
00:29:23,111 --> 00:29:25,170
Mr. Matthews, here.
Let me do that, sir.

259
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,610
I wouldn't have had
this happen for anything.

260
00:29:27,782 --> 00:29:30,945
I think we'd all be more comfortable
if you just sat down.

261
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:33,019
Yes, sir, thank you.

262
00:29:33,187 --> 00:29:37,521
Well, one thing about a little water,
it never does any harm.

263
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,020
Shaw, Mr. Casey tells me
you're a good dancer.

264
00:29:42,397 --> 00:29:45,594
Yeah? Well, I can't argue with him
about that.

265
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:49,669
If you're as good as he says, we may
be able to use you in our next show.

266
00:29:49,837 --> 00:29:52,601
You'd be making no mistake.
Johnny and I did a specialty act...

267
00:29:52,774 --> 00:29:55,572
...in a musical show in Kansas City.
We did three minutes in one.

268
00:29:55,743 --> 00:29:57,938
- Stopped the show cold.
- I don't doubt it.

269
00:29:58,112 --> 00:29:59,773
If my partner were here,
we could do it.

270
00:29:59,948 --> 00:30:01,711
- I'm not interested in your act.
- It's great.

271
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:05,080
And I'm not interested in your partner.
This is a one-way deal.

272
00:30:06,754 --> 00:30:09,120
- No team, huh?
- Nope.

273
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:11,918
You see, we're looking
for a new personality...

274
00:30:12,093 --> 00:30:13,958
...a leading man for Miss Bennett.

275
00:30:15,697 --> 00:30:17,892
Me? Dance with Clare Bennett?

276
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,590
That was the idea.

277
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,498
Mind standing up for a minute?

278
00:30:27,675 --> 00:30:30,872
I want to see how your height
would be with Miss Bennett.

279
00:30:34,315 --> 00:30:37,148
Yeah. Before we go any further,
I want to see you dance.

280
00:30:37,318 --> 00:30:39,377
- Have you caught Miss Bennett's show?
- No, sir.

281
00:30:39,554 --> 00:30:42,079
Go see it. There's a number called
"Between You and Me."

282
00:30:42,256 --> 00:30:45,953
If you think you can do it, I'll try you out
Saturday night after the show closes.

283
00:30:46,461 --> 00:30:49,430
Gosh, that would be great.

284
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,758
- But...
- What's the matter?

285
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:55,460
- Nothing, Mr. Matthews, nothing.
- Still worried about your partner?

286
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:59,538
A lot of partners in the theater
have outgrown each other.

287
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:03,241
- Do you hear me, Shaw?
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

288
00:31:03,411 --> 00:31:07,404
I guess you're right, Mr. Matthews.
A guy's got to look out for himself.

289
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:10,846
Well, it's up to you.
Take it or leave it.

290
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:12,942
I'll take it.

291
00:31:18,726 --> 00:31:19,988
Hey, where you been?

292
00:31:20,161 --> 00:31:23,221
To every agent and manager in town,
but I've got a perfect record.

293
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:25,457
Didn't see one of them.

294
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:28,830
You should have stuck with me.
You'd have seen Bert Matthews.

295
00:31:29,003 --> 00:31:32,097
Yeah, I'll bet.
What did he do, drop in for tea?

296
00:31:32,273 --> 00:31:36,539
No, he phoned,
and I went over there.

297
00:31:36,878 --> 00:31:38,470
I met Clare Bennett.

298
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:41,740
- Quit kidding, will you?
- I'm not kidding, Johnny.

299
00:31:41,916 --> 00:31:44,851
Honest. It's true.

300
00:31:46,454 --> 00:31:49,480
True? Well, go on.
What happened?

301
00:31:50,191 --> 00:31:54,184
- What happened?
- Well, we had a little business talk.

302
00:31:54,362 --> 00:31:56,626
There's a chance we might
get a bit in the new show?

303
00:31:56,798 --> 00:31:58,026
- Wait a minute...
- Do you...?

304
00:31:58,199 --> 00:32:00,292
Don't interrupt me.
Will you let me finish?

305
00:32:00,468 --> 00:32:02,732
- All right.
- They're looking for new personality.

306
00:32:02,904 --> 00:32:05,031
They must have caught our act,
and like you said...

307
00:32:05,206 --> 00:32:07,299
...you never know who's out there.
- We're in!

308
00:32:07,475 --> 00:32:09,500
- Wait a minute.
- When do we start? What do we do?

309
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,578
- Johnny, please.
- "Please," he says!

310
00:32:12,747 --> 00:32:15,716
I wish I could have been with you.
What did he say? Tell me.

311
00:32:15,883 --> 00:32:18,943
- Johnny, will you not get too excited?
- All right, all right.

312
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,747
It's cold.

313
00:32:20,922 --> 00:32:22,890
Cold? But you just said...

314
00:32:23,057 --> 00:32:27,426
They want one guy
to dance with Clare Bennett.

315
00:32:27,595 --> 00:32:30,996
I see. They want a leading man.

316
00:32:31,165 --> 00:32:33,599
Wonder why they phoned us?

317
00:32:34,402 --> 00:32:36,597
They didn't phone us.

318
00:32:36,771 --> 00:32:40,867
- They phoned me.
- And then showed you the door.

319
00:32:41,609 --> 00:32:46,273
You don't rate me very high, do you?
They offered me an audition.

320
00:32:47,515 --> 00:32:51,611
To be Clare Bennett's leading man?
You?

321
00:32:54,489 --> 00:32:58,357
Gee, that's great.
Why, that's terrific!

322
00:32:58,526 --> 00:33:00,255
But what do you mean,
it's all cold?

323
00:33:00,428 --> 00:33:03,261
What would you have said
if they offered you a job without me?

324
00:33:03,431 --> 00:33:05,524
- Well, I'd...
- That's exactly what I said.

325
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,329
I said, "Look, Mr. Matthews, we're a
team, and that's the way we stay."

326
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:12,064
- You crazy...
- He gave me a lot of hot air about...

327
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,038
...what a great opportunity it was,
but I said, "Wait a minute.

328
00:33:15,209 --> 00:33:18,906
We've been together five long years.
And five pretty tough years."

329
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,480
Tough, but a lot of laughs
when you think back.

330
00:33:21,649 --> 00:33:23,378
You said it.

331
00:33:23,551 --> 00:33:25,746
Why, you half-witted...

332
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,480
Turning down the chance of a lifetime
on account of me.

333
00:33:28,689 --> 00:33:31,556
Well, it isn't only a question
of you, it's...

334
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:36,487
- It's a question of being on the level.
- What a guy. I know what I'd do.

335
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:39,724
- Yeah?
- I'd get on that phone...

336
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:41,835
...and tell him I'd take it.
But quick.

337
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:45,834
Well, I wouldn't be any good
without you anyhow.

338
00:33:46,207 --> 00:33:49,836
You know you figure out
all the dance steps.

339
00:33:50,745 --> 00:33:54,738
I'm not leaving town.
I'll be around.

340
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:56,679
You mean you're gonna
help me, Johnny?

341
00:33:56,851 --> 00:33:59,752
I'll figure out a routine for you
that'll kill them.

342
00:33:59,921 --> 00:34:02,947
What a guy. But this isn't
a sure job yet, Johnny.

343
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,558
It's only a tryout. They want me
to watch the show...

344
00:34:05,726 --> 00:34:09,184
...and get up in that "Between You
and Me" number with Clare Bennett.

345
00:34:09,597 --> 00:34:11,690
She's wonderful in it.

346
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:14,759
Have you seen it?

347
00:34:15,036 --> 00:34:18,528
Yeah. She's attractive, huh?
Close to?

348
00:34:18,706 --> 00:34:23,143
Attractive? She's the tops, Johnny.
You've never seen anything like her.

349
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,838
From the minute she met me, she acted
as though she'd known me all her life.

350
00:34:27,014 --> 00:34:29,141
Imagine.
The biggest star on Broadway!

351
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:33,185
You wanna know something else?
I think she kind of took a shine to me.

352
00:34:33,354 --> 00:34:34,912
I guess that'd be hard to take.

353
00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:38,547
Hey, let's get going. Get on that
telephone and tell Matthews it's all set.

354
00:34:38,726 --> 00:34:41,593
I don't have to do that.
You see, we left it like this:

355
00:34:41,762 --> 00:34:44,663
If I change my mind,
I show up at the theater tonight.

356
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,164
And that's just where you'll be!

357
00:39:29,817 --> 00:39:32,911
But that's not him!
That's not the Shaw I saw...

358
00:39:33,087 --> 00:39:34,679
I mean, that's an imposter!

359
00:39:35,256 --> 00:39:37,383
Casey? Casey!

360
00:39:37,558 --> 00:39:39,423
- Well, I better...
- Casey!

361
00:39:39,593 --> 00:39:42,357
- I'm sorry, Bert. I don't...
- Congratulations, Bob.

362
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:45,055
- That boy is a real find!
- You mean you like him?

363
00:39:45,232 --> 00:39:47,132
- Like him? O'Grady!
- But...

364
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,825
- Take this down, Amy.
- He's not...

365
00:39:49,003 --> 00:39:51,403
I'm gonna give King Shaw the lead
in the next show...

366
00:39:51,572 --> 00:39:53,335
...and I want you
to get to work on him.

367
00:39:53,507 --> 00:39:55,737
Build up a personality for him.
Change his address.

368
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:58,208
Take him to a first-class hotel
and a good tailor.

369
00:39:58,379 --> 00:40:00,847
Let him be seen at the night spots.
Get him talked about!

370
00:40:01,015 --> 00:40:03,882
Build him up until the customers
know the name "King Shaw."

371
00:40:04,051 --> 00:40:05,780
But he's not...
Well, l...

372
00:40:05,953 --> 00:40:07,978
- Where are you going?
- He's getting some air.

373
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,520
Yes!

374
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,548
Yes, yes, yes!

375
00:40:11,725 --> 00:40:13,522
How was it, Johnny?

376
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,985
Miss Bennett,
this is Johnny Brett.

377
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,630
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

378
00:40:17,798 --> 00:40:19,288
- Is this your partner?
- Yeah.

379
00:40:19,466 --> 00:40:21,730
- Good, wasn't he?
- First time too. Proud of him?

380
00:40:21,902 --> 00:40:24,132
- Plenty.
- Okay, King, who's your agent?

381
00:40:24,305 --> 00:40:26,967
- I haven't any.
- Don't need one. We'll sign a contract.

382
00:40:27,141 --> 00:40:28,130
A contract?

383
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:30,607
You'll never regret it
as long as you live.

384
00:40:30,778 --> 00:40:33,508
Change your dress. The three
of us are going out to celebrate.

385
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,479
- This is Mr. Brett. He's...
- How do you do?

386
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:37,639
How do you...?

387
00:40:37,818 --> 00:40:40,150
Come up to the office,
and we'll fix everything.

388
00:40:41,088 --> 00:40:43,147
I'm glad to have met you,
Miss Bennett.

389
00:40:44,458 --> 00:40:46,858
Mr. Brett. Johnny!

390
00:40:47,394 --> 00:40:50,522
Look. Come out with us tonight.

391
00:40:50,898 --> 00:40:52,422
Thanks.

392
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,733
I'd rather not. Thanks.

393
00:40:55,903 --> 00:40:58,599
Thanks a lot.
So long, Miss Bennett.

394
00:40:58,772 --> 00:41:00,501
- Good night.
- Good night.

395
00:41:04,578 --> 00:41:06,307
Good night.

396
00:41:08,249 --> 00:41:11,685
Pardon me. I'd like to talk to you
for a minute, if you don't mind.

397
00:41:11,852 --> 00:41:13,752
Now, look,
you'll be paid very soon.

398
00:41:13,921 --> 00:41:15,980
Paid? Do you owe me something?

399
00:41:16,156 --> 00:41:18,124
- You're not a collector?
- Collector?

400
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:23,389
I used to collect stamps, but I gave it
up when people stopped writing to me.

401
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,828
Don't you remember meeting me
four nights ago?

402
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,160
Distinctly.

403
00:41:27,334 --> 00:41:29,894
You told me then
that your name was King Shaw.

404
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,368
That's when I thought
you were a bill collector.

405
00:41:32,539 --> 00:41:35,235
- Bill collector, me?
- Yes. I'm awfully sorry.

406
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:36,740
I'm sorry too. For you.

407
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:41,677
Because that little mix-up lost you
the job as Clare Bennett's leading man.

408
00:41:42,016 --> 00:41:43,176
What's that?

409
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:48,879
I thought your name was King Shaw,
so I sold King Shaw to my associates.

410
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,884
Oh, I see.

411
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:55,859
Yes, well, maybe we better
have a drink together, huh?

412
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:58,498
Yeah, let's.
I could use one.

413
00:41:58,666 --> 00:42:01,931
I'm going to clear this whole thing up.
You're going to play that part!

414
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:05,469
No, I'm not. Now, look, Mr. Casey,
King's the man for you.

415
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:08,506
You need a personality.
Why, he's a natural.

416
00:42:08,676 --> 00:42:11,144
Women go for him like a
bargain sale. Always have.

417
00:42:11,312 --> 00:42:14,042
- Yes, but I saw you dance.
- Yes, and you saw him dance too.

418
00:42:14,214 --> 00:42:16,842
Tonight with Clare Bennett.
They were wonderful together.

419
00:42:17,017 --> 00:42:19,485
- Rabbit?
- No.

420
00:42:19,653 --> 00:42:24,147
You're just like me. I'm always
pushing my partner ahead too.

421
00:42:24,325 --> 00:42:26,520
But I'm gonna fix this.

422
00:42:26,994 --> 00:42:32,398
Look. Matthews is satisfied,
I'm satisfied. Why shouldn't you be?

423
00:42:32,566 --> 00:42:34,466
Well, maybe you're right.

424
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,432
- Squirrel?
- No.

425
00:42:36,603 --> 00:42:39,265
I tell you what,
I'll discover you next year.

426
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,305
That'll make me a hero
all over again.

427
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:43,340
- I can hardly wait.
- Is it a deal?

428
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:45,239
- Sure.
- That's wonderful.

429
00:42:45,412 --> 00:42:47,573
That's the first deal
I've been in on in years.

430
00:42:47,748 --> 00:42:49,375
- Beaver?
- Certainly not!

431
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:52,781
- Let's drink to the deal.
- Don't you think you've had enough?

432
00:42:52,953 --> 00:42:54,921
Just one more won't hurt.

433
00:42:55,089 --> 00:42:57,785
- Herman!
- That's right. Ermine.

434
00:43:12,338 --> 00:43:14,397
- Hi, Johnny.
- Hi.

435
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,272
- What are you doing?
- Getting a swelled head.

436
00:43:17,443 --> 00:43:18,432
What?

437
00:43:18,611 --> 00:43:20,977
Why, I even know this guy.
I live with him.

438
00:43:21,146 --> 00:43:23,740
- Good publicity, huh?
- Yeah.

439
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:25,740
- Hey!
- Yeah?

440
00:43:25,918 --> 00:43:30,355
- How'd the rehearsals go today? Good?
- A little off, but all right.

441
00:43:30,522 --> 00:43:32,012
Say, King.

442
00:43:32,191 --> 00:43:33,783
I had an idea this afternoon.

443
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:36,120
The step you do at the end
of the second chorus?

444
00:43:36,295 --> 00:43:37,887
Suppose you try it this way.

445
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,866
- Say, that looks good.
- Try it.

446
00:43:47,139 --> 00:43:49,937
- Yeah, that's it. How does it feel?
- Feels great.

447
00:43:50,109 --> 00:43:53,704
I think we can brush up the number
in a couple of other places too.

448
00:43:53,879 --> 00:43:55,073
Want to work tonight?

449
00:43:55,247 --> 00:43:58,148
No, not tonight.
I'm dining out.

450
00:43:58,317 --> 00:44:00,182
- With Clare?
- Who else?

451
00:44:03,856 --> 00:44:06,256
Oh, boy, what a gal!

452
00:44:06,425 --> 00:44:09,326
And fun too.
I wish you could see something.

453
00:44:09,495 --> 00:44:13,090
Everywhere we go, people start buzzing,
"There's King Shaw and Clare Bennett.

454
00:44:13,265 --> 00:44:16,962
King Shaw and Clare Bennett. King
Shaw and Clare Bennett. Oh, oh, oh!"

455
00:44:17,836 --> 00:44:21,602
Boy, you certainly are moving up fast.
"King Shaw and Clare Bennett."

456
00:44:21,774 --> 00:44:23,969
Well, I think I get top billing with her.

457
00:44:24,143 --> 00:44:26,703
You know, I never had a girl
hit me like this.

458
00:44:26,879 --> 00:44:29,143
I always thought
I could take them or leave them.

459
00:44:29,315 --> 00:44:31,283
Well, here's one that I'm not leaving.

460
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:35,284
And what's more,
I think she'd feel pretty bad if I did.

461
00:44:39,558 --> 00:44:42,391
If it's Mr. Shaw,
I'll be right out, Angel.

462
00:44:42,561 --> 00:44:45,291
- Shall I offer him a drink?
- Well, don't encourage him.

463
00:44:45,464 --> 00:44:48,331
That boy don't need
no encouragement, honey.

464
00:45:11,523 --> 00:45:14,788
- Hello, Clare.
- Hello, Bert. Anything wrong?

465
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,259
That's what I came to find out.
From you.

466
00:45:20,699 --> 00:45:22,189
Look, Clare...

467
00:45:22,668 --> 00:45:25,660
...you've never gone out like this
during the last days of rehearsals.

468
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:29,001
You've never wanted to
until King Shaw came along.

469
00:45:29,174 --> 00:45:31,802
- Why the change?
- I'm having fun.

470
00:45:31,977 --> 00:45:35,276
Just watching the kick he gets
out of going places and seeing things.

471
00:45:35,447 --> 00:45:37,074
Things he's never seen before.

472
00:45:37,249 --> 00:45:40,878
You got the same fun out of watching
me when you first took me out places.

473
00:45:41,053 --> 00:45:45,387
- Not quite the same, I hope.
- I didn't mean that, Bert.

474
00:45:46,191 --> 00:45:49,126
Is that the only reason
you're running around with him?

475
00:45:49,294 --> 00:45:52,593
If there were any other,
I'd tell you.

476
00:45:54,633 --> 00:45:58,228
Be sure that King understands
there isn't any other reason.

477
00:45:58,404 --> 00:45:59,598
I will.

478
00:45:59,772 --> 00:46:03,264
If he thinks you're falling for him,
he'll be bossing me around the theater!

479
00:46:03,442 --> 00:46:07,469
You're not doing him any good.
All that lad wants to do is to play.

480
00:46:07,646 --> 00:46:11,548
He should be home tonight resting
or rehearsing, and so should you.

481
00:46:12,451 --> 00:46:14,749
What excuse can I give him
as late as this?

482
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,514
- Well, tell him the truth.
- That's an idea.

483
00:46:17,689 --> 00:46:20,249
No, no, that wouldn't be feminine.

484
00:46:20,426 --> 00:46:23,623
Give him the one you always give me:
The headache.

485
00:46:24,596 --> 00:46:26,791
- Angel.
- Yes, ma'am?

486
00:46:26,965 --> 00:46:29,092
- Get Mr. Shaw on the telephone.
- Yes, ma'am.

487
00:46:29,268 --> 00:46:32,032
Well, good night. Have a good rest.
See you at rehearsal.

488
00:46:32,204 --> 00:46:33,933
Good night, Bert.

489
00:46:36,241 --> 00:46:39,108
I know we've got a tough day
tomorrow, but it's no tougher...

490
00:46:39,278 --> 00:46:40,870
Besides, I've got a headache.

491
00:46:42,314 --> 00:46:44,282
Oh, I see.

492
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:48,313
Well, if that's the way you feel
about it, it's okay with me.

493
00:46:49,788 --> 00:46:51,949
Sure. I'll see you tomorrow.

494
00:46:52,124 --> 00:46:53,921
Goodbye.

495
00:46:57,963 --> 00:46:59,726
- What's the matter?
- Nothing!

496
00:46:59,898 --> 00:47:02,992
- Aren't you going out with her?
- She's got a headache.

497
00:47:03,168 --> 00:47:07,002
- And I sent her orchids!
- You should have sent her aspirin.

498
00:47:07,172 --> 00:47:10,403
Very funny! It's a fine time
of night to break a date.

499
00:47:10,576 --> 00:47:12,806
Just when I was all keyed up
to take her out!

500
00:47:12,978 --> 00:47:15,469
It's just as well. Now
we can go through that number.

501
00:47:15,647 --> 00:47:19,515
How do you expect me to concentrate,
when a girl plays a trick like that on me?

502
00:47:19,685 --> 00:47:22,586
- Maybe she has got a headache.
- Yeah? Well, I'll show her!

503
00:47:22,754 --> 00:47:25,814
- I'm going out on the town.
- That'll make two headaches.

504
00:47:25,991 --> 00:47:28,391
Boy, are you full of jokes!

505
00:47:39,638 --> 00:47:41,833
- Hello.
- Hello, King. This is Clare again.

506
00:47:42,007 --> 00:47:44,441
<i>I just called back to say</i>
<i>I'm sorry about tonight.</i>

507
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:45,770
But...

508
00:47:45,944 --> 00:47:49,277
<i>That was a silly excuse I gave you</i>
<i>about having a headache...</i>

509
00:47:49,448 --> 00:47:52,315
<i>... but we do have a tough day</i>
<i>tomorrow and...</i>

510
00:47:52,985 --> 00:47:53,974
But...

511
00:47:54,153 --> 00:47:57,350
Don't argue with me, King.
Just say I'm forgiven.

512
00:48:00,159 --> 00:48:03,026
Well, at least say something.

513
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:06,889
I love you, Clare.

514
00:48:23,448 --> 00:48:26,110
What a stupid guy!

515
00:48:32,624 --> 00:48:36,185
Y'all sure been mighty sweet
to poor little lonesome Emmy Lou.

516
00:48:36,361 --> 00:48:39,956
All alone up North,
not knowing nobody.

517
00:48:40,132 --> 00:48:41,895
Why, it's a pleasure.

518
00:48:42,067 --> 00:48:44,297
- Hi, Emmy Lou.
- Hello, honey.

519
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:47,400
I thought you didn't know anybody
up North.

520
00:48:47,573 --> 00:48:51,100
Why, he's an old friend of mine
from the South, sugar.

521
00:48:52,911 --> 00:48:57,348
Y'all know what it means down South
when a gentleman gives a lady a cape?

522
00:48:57,516 --> 00:48:59,484
She gives it back again.

523
00:48:59,651 --> 00:49:03,485
Lordy, no, sugar! It means
he's got to give her a ring.

524
00:49:06,058 --> 00:49:08,151
Hello, honey. It sure is!

525
00:49:08,327 --> 00:49:11,228
Why, I declare, sugar,
this place is full of Southerners.

526
00:49:11,396 --> 00:49:15,264
- Southerners?
- Makes me feel so safe.

527
00:49:16,235 --> 00:49:19,727
It's getting powerful warm here.
I mean, for the North.

528
00:49:19,905 --> 00:49:23,033
I declare, you're the strangest man.
Just like I heard you was.

529
00:49:23,208 --> 00:49:26,200
- Did you hear about me?
- Lordy, yes, sugar.

530
00:49:26,378 --> 00:49:29,506
The cutest little Southern girl
told me all about you.

531
00:49:29,681 --> 00:49:32,514
- She did, huh? Well...
- She sure enough did.

532
00:49:32,684 --> 00:49:36,142
- Her name was Pearl Delange.
- Delange!

533
00:49:37,656 --> 00:49:42,389
- She told you all about me?
- Every single thing.

534
00:49:42,561 --> 00:49:46,190
Well, I guess it's getting powerful late
for poor little me to be out.

535
00:49:46,465 --> 00:49:48,763
Now, don't you bother.
I can get home by myself.

536
00:49:48,934 --> 00:49:50,299
I know, but what about the...?

537
00:49:50,469 --> 00:49:52,664
Down South,
the gentleman pays the check.

538
00:49:52,838 --> 00:49:55,830
No, not the check.
I mean, what about the...?

539
00:49:56,475 --> 00:49:58,102
King!

540
00:50:00,879 --> 00:50:04,042
You can't leave now.
You've got to meet King Shaw.

541
00:50:04,216 --> 00:50:08,050
He's the richest man in the North
and the South too.

542
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:11,656
Well, I might just stay long enough
to meet up with him.

543
00:50:11,923 --> 00:50:15,324
King, my boy, I'm delighted
to see you. Delighted.

544
00:50:15,494 --> 00:50:17,052
Meet Miss Emmy Lou Lee.

545
00:50:17,229 --> 00:50:21,256
Mr. Shaw, Miss Lee.
Shaw, Mr. Lee. Sit down.

546
00:50:24,202 --> 00:50:25,635
Hello, honey.

547
00:50:25,804 --> 00:50:30,537
Why don't you ask Miss Delange...?
Emmy Lou to dance?

548
00:50:30,709 --> 00:50:35,442
- Okay, Em. On your feet.
- I'd love to, sugar.

549
00:50:53,832 --> 00:50:56,960
All right, everybody.
Let's get...

550
00:50:59,871 --> 00:51:03,671
What is this? What is this?
Who are these people?

551
00:51:04,443 --> 00:51:07,571
This is the greatest discovery
of Mr. Casey's life.

552
00:51:07,746 --> 00:51:10,044
He wants them to audition for you
before rehearsal.

553
00:51:10,215 --> 00:51:14,311
- That Casey's crazy! Where is he?
- He's not so crazy, he's still in bed.

554
00:51:14,486 --> 00:51:17,182
All right, but make it snappy.
We got a rehearsal.

555
00:51:17,356 --> 00:51:18,755
Okay.

556
00:51:27,065 --> 00:51:28,623
Okay, boys.

557
00:51:49,855 --> 00:51:52,016
How do you do?

558
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:53,817
How do you do?

559
00:51:54,593 --> 00:51:56,561
How do you do?

560
00:51:57,829 --> 00:52:00,320
Fancy seeing you here.

561
00:52:06,571 --> 00:52:07,595
Thank you.

562
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:07,664
Can you hear me?

563
00:53:46,638 --> 00:53:49,937
That's fine. Very fine.
Amy! Amy!

564
00:53:50,375 --> 00:53:53,208
That's all, thanks.
We'll let you know.

565
00:53:54,045 --> 00:53:55,307
Thank you.

566
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,347
Give them back to Casey.
He deserves them.

567
00:53:58,817 --> 00:54:00,785
All right, clear the stage, please.

568
00:54:00,952 --> 00:54:03,443
Ready for the Harlequin number.
Take it from King's entrance.

569
00:54:03,622 --> 00:54:05,317
Give us the pickup, will you?

570
00:54:10,095 --> 00:54:14,691
Stop it! Come on, Mr. Shaw,
that's you. What are you waiting for?

571
00:54:14,866 --> 00:54:17,198
- Play it again.
- Mr. Matthews.

572
00:54:17,802 --> 00:54:22,205
Mr. Shaw isn't here yet,
and I'm afraid it's all my fault.

573
00:54:23,074 --> 00:54:26,532
- So you didn't take my advice last night?
- Yes, I did.

574
00:54:26,711 --> 00:54:30,238
Mr. Shaw was here this morning,
but his tailor phoned...

575
00:54:30,415 --> 00:54:34,215
...and I thought we weren't going to do
the number until this afternoon...

576
00:54:34,386 --> 00:54:37,480
...so he went to the tailor's.
- He did, did he?

577
00:54:37,656 --> 00:54:40,352
I'm afraid King is going to be
a little late this morning.

578
00:54:40,525 --> 00:54:43,494
- He's late right now.
- That's what I came to explain.

579
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:46,019
Good morning.

580
00:54:46,197 --> 00:54:48,859
King's been up all night
with a very bad toothache.

581
00:54:49,034 --> 00:54:51,525
- Toothache?
- Yes. He's gone to the dentist.

582
00:54:51,703 --> 00:54:54,103
You mean tailor's.

583
00:54:55,473 --> 00:54:58,135
Yes. Dr. Taylor's.

584
00:54:59,444 --> 00:55:01,605
You two ought to get together.

585
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:03,372
All right, ladies and gentlemen...

586
00:55:03,548 --> 00:55:07,040
...we'll resume rehearsal when Mr. Shaw
returns from his remarkable adventure.

587
00:55:07,419 --> 00:55:11,515
It seems he's gone to the tailor's
to have a tooth pulled.

588
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:15,592
Johnny.

589
00:55:16,695 --> 00:55:18,720
I'd better go and see
if King is coming.

590
00:55:18,897 --> 00:55:21,798
In all my theater experience,
I've never met anybody like him.

591
00:55:21,967 --> 00:55:23,867
If he isn't interested
in the show's success...

592
00:55:24,035 --> 00:55:26,003
...he might have
some consideration for us.

593
00:55:26,171 --> 00:55:28,435
If he doesn't pay
more attention to his job...

594
00:55:28,607 --> 00:55:31,337
...Matthews is going to stop barking
and start biting.

595
00:55:31,509 --> 00:55:33,909
He'll be here any minute.
He was getting up when I left.

596
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,877
- He went out last night, didn't he?
- Yes, he did.

597
00:55:37,048 --> 00:55:40,814
- Right after I phoned him the first time?
- Yes.

598
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:46,079
No! No. I mean...
I'll just go out and see if he's coming.

599
00:55:46,257 --> 00:55:47,588
Yes.

600
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:54,430
No rush.
They've broken for lunch.

601
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:56,829
- Did you square me with Matthews?
- Not exactly.

602
00:55:57,002 --> 00:56:00,130
Clare spoke to Mr. Matthews first.
We sort of got our wires crossed.

603
00:56:00,305 --> 00:56:02,034
- She went to bat for me?
- Yeah.

604
00:56:02,207 --> 00:56:04,368
What do you know!
In front of the whole company?

605
00:56:04,542 --> 00:56:07,272
- That's right.
- What a sucker I was last night.

606
00:56:07,445 --> 00:56:10,710
She was on the level all along.
She really had a headache!

607
00:56:10,882 --> 00:56:13,112
What a gal!
Sticking up for me.

608
00:56:13,284 --> 00:56:15,616
- Who do you love?
- You, you. You silly...

609
00:56:15,787 --> 00:56:17,914
And that's who she loves too!

610
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:23,418
Come in.

611
00:56:26,364 --> 00:56:28,161
Hello, darling.

612
00:56:30,135 --> 00:56:33,332
I'm sorry I'm late, Clare.
But then again, I'm glad.

613
00:56:33,505 --> 00:56:36,167
If I hadn't been late, you wouldn't
have had to go to bat for me.

614
00:56:36,341 --> 00:56:39,276
- I wouldn't have found out how you felt.
- I'll tell you how I feel.

615
00:56:39,444 --> 00:56:42,038
You don't have to.
Going to bat for me was enough.

616
00:56:42,213 --> 00:56:45,808
- I don't know why I did.
- I'll bet I know why you did.

617
00:56:47,719 --> 00:56:50,847
- Don't ever do that again!
- You mean this?

618
00:56:53,324 --> 00:56:55,656
Now, would you mind
leaving me alone?

619
00:56:57,128 --> 00:57:00,564
Say, sometimes I think
you don't know your own mind.

620
00:57:13,278 --> 00:57:14,973
What's the matter?

621
00:57:15,146 --> 00:57:18,638
The more you know about women,
the less you know about women.

622
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:22,080
Maybe it's time you found out
they're not all alike.

623
00:57:23,421 --> 00:57:25,855
Come on, we'd better
go through your routine.

624
00:57:26,057 --> 00:57:29,390
Routine! Routine! Routine!
Don't you ever think of anything else?

625
00:57:29,561 --> 00:57:32,860
- Okay. It's your routine, not mine.
- Wait a minute, Johnny.

626
00:57:33,031 --> 00:57:37,695
Don't be like that. I'm sorry.
I guess I'm a little overtrained.

627
00:57:38,036 --> 00:57:39,435
Okay, kid.

628
00:57:40,605 --> 00:57:42,197
Watch this.

629
00:57:42,774 --> 00:57:44,241
You know the old:

630
00:57:45,677 --> 00:57:48,475
- Yeah?
- That's out. I got a new one.

631
00:57:52,083 --> 00:57:54,551
Why do you have to keep
changing the steps on me?

632
00:57:54,719 --> 00:57:56,880
It's neater this way.
Then you go into the old slap.

633
01:03:27,418 --> 01:03:29,818
That was swell, Johnny! Swell!

634
01:03:29,987 --> 01:03:32,888
Thanks. I was just limbering up.
You know, a little workout.

635
01:03:33,057 --> 01:03:34,957
- Yes, I know.
- Gotta keep in shape.

636
01:03:35,126 --> 01:03:37,754
Sure. I noticed
you changed it a little.

637
01:03:37,929 --> 01:03:39,897
- Yeah, a little.
- King ask you to?

638
01:03:40,064 --> 01:03:42,225
No, I just did it
by accident, I guess.

639
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,800
I like it better by accident.
You must show it to King.

640
01:03:44,969 --> 01:03:48,461
Yes, l... Well, I mean,
King's doing all right.

641
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:51,870
You know, there's one thing
I'd like to get straight.

642
01:03:53,711 --> 01:03:57,169
Casey must have seen you dance when
you and King were together. I wonder...

643
01:03:57,348 --> 01:03:59,748
I know what you wonder,
but Casey has the advantage.

644
01:03:59,917 --> 01:04:02,613
You've never seen King with
an audience. He's really great.

645
01:04:02,787 --> 01:04:06,746
Oh, I see. And I suppose you
just fade in front of an audience.

646
01:04:06,924 --> 01:04:09,688
Not exactly.
Well, a little. I mean, you know.

647
01:04:10,595 --> 01:04:13,894
Well, I guess I mustn't
keep you from lunch.

648
01:04:14,065 --> 01:04:15,896
Oh, I never eat lunch.

649
01:04:16,067 --> 01:04:17,466
Is that so?

650
01:04:17,635 --> 01:04:20,263
- Do you eat breakfast?
- I'd love it!

651
01:04:22,006 --> 01:04:23,405
Now?

652
01:04:23,574 --> 01:04:25,701
Gosh, that'd be great. Only...

653
01:04:25,877 --> 01:04:28,277
- Only what?
- I have to do something for King.

654
01:04:28,446 --> 01:04:30,607
How about letting King
do something for himself?

655
01:04:30,781 --> 01:04:32,874
- Of course, if you don't want to...
- Want to?

656
01:04:33,651 --> 01:04:35,619
Why, there's nothing I'd rather do.

657
01:04:35,786 --> 01:04:38,220
Then what are we waiting for?

658
01:04:38,389 --> 01:04:40,721
Lunch, I guess.

659
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:51,596
Honestly, I wish this thing
would stop following me around.

660
01:04:51,769 --> 01:04:55,569
It seems everywhere I go, it's in my
way, and I can't do anything about it.

661
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:58,265
Come on, let's get out of here.

662
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:10,681
Do I really look like that?

663
01:05:11,956 --> 01:05:15,824
I don't make your face.
I just make your silhouette.

664
01:05:18,329 --> 01:05:21,298
So, lady, please.

665
01:05:21,465 --> 01:05:24,525
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

666
01:05:27,672 --> 01:05:29,071
Let's see.

667
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:35,868
What seems to be
the matter with this?

668
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:40,546
Well, I don't think you quite got her.
Now take her nose, for instance.

669
01:05:40,718 --> 01:05:45,849
- Her nose...
- Her nose is exactly like this!

670
01:05:46,023 --> 01:05:48,617
Of course it is.
He's supercritical.

671
01:05:48,793 --> 01:05:50,727
You said it, lady!

672
01:05:50,895 --> 01:05:54,558
- I'm afraid you've hurt his feelings.
- I'm sorry, professor.

673
01:05:54,732 --> 01:05:56,700
- Here!
- Oh, thank you very much.

674
01:05:56,867 --> 01:06:02,134
Maybe, probably, perhaps
you are not so super after all.

675
01:06:03,975 --> 01:06:06,535
Now you see what comes
of criticizing an artist?

676
01:06:06,711 --> 01:06:08,110
He asked me what I thought.

677
01:06:08,279 --> 01:06:10,338
Do you always tell people
what you think?

678
01:06:10,514 --> 01:06:11,708
Yeah, sure.

679
01:06:11,882 --> 01:06:14,077
Amazing.

680
01:06:14,252 --> 01:06:16,117
What are you thinking now, Johnny?

681
01:06:16,287 --> 01:06:19,620
- I was thinking...
- He don't like your nose.

682
01:06:22,493 --> 01:06:25,553
No. I was thinking...

683
01:06:27,498 --> 01:06:30,262
...about that dance
you do in the second act.

684
01:06:30,434 --> 01:06:32,959
Was that what
you were really thinking, Johnny?

685
01:06:33,137 --> 01:06:37,198
Yes, really. That first step.
I like it. The way you do it.

686
01:06:37,375 --> 01:06:39,605
- It's swell.
- It's very simple.

687
01:06:39,777 --> 01:06:42,302
- I know.
- There's nothing to it.

688
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:43,913
Look.

689
01:06:49,887 --> 01:06:51,411
Come on, try it.

690
01:06:51,589 --> 01:06:57,186
I have tried it, but I don't seem to
get quite the same thing. Let's see.

691
01:07:00,631 --> 01:07:02,394
That's it.

692
01:07:02,566 --> 01:07:04,761
And you can travel
with it too, can't you?

693
01:07:04,935 --> 01:07:06,903
Let's see.

694
01:07:13,344 --> 01:07:14,538
Simple.

695
01:07:20,685 --> 01:07:23,245
Funny, sometimes
the simpler the step...

696
01:09:20,938 --> 01:09:22,565
Well, I don't know.

697
01:09:26,977 --> 01:09:29,605
What kind of a show is this anyway?

698
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:32,214
Amateur theatricals?

699
01:09:32,383 --> 01:09:34,943
How are we gonna
open Wednesday?

700
01:09:35,119 --> 01:09:36,677
This morning, no leading man...

701
01:09:36,854 --> 01:09:40,915
...and now it's 2:30, and the leading
lady hasn't shown up. Where is she?

702
01:09:41,091 --> 01:09:44,219
What are you barking at me for?
I haven't got her up my sleeve.

703
01:09:44,395 --> 01:09:46,955
- I haven't seen her.
- You're not here enough to see anything.

704
01:09:47,765 --> 01:09:50,063
- I tell you, I'm not going...
- Hello.

705
01:09:50,234 --> 01:09:52,702
- Anything wrong?
- Oh, no.

706
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:56,533
No, everything's fine.
Everything's dandy.

707
01:09:56,707 --> 01:09:59,437
- Where have you been?
- We didn't realize it was so late.

708
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:01,134
I'll get ready right away.

709
01:10:01,312 --> 01:10:03,542
And make it snappy!

710
01:10:11,555 --> 01:10:12,886
What are you waiting for?

711
01:10:13,057 --> 01:10:15,184
- Why don't you get ready?
- I've been ready.

712
01:10:15,359 --> 01:10:18,988
Then tell that stooge of yours I won't
have him holding up my rehearsals.

713
01:10:19,163 --> 01:10:21,222
I don't know why he hangs
around here anyway.

714
01:10:21,398 --> 01:10:25,459
Don't worry. I'll tell him that.
And a lot more too.

715
01:10:28,339 --> 01:10:30,603
I want to talk to you.
Come into my room.

716
01:10:30,774 --> 01:10:33,470
Or should I say our room?

717
01:10:38,148 --> 01:10:41,015
- What's the matter, King?
- So you took Clare out to lunch?

718
01:10:41,185 --> 01:10:46,589
- No crime in that, is there?
- No, no. We share everything.

719
01:10:48,826 --> 01:10:51,852
Don't be silly, King.
I know how you feel about Clare.

720
01:10:52,029 --> 01:10:55,988
You know I wouldn't double-cross you
any more than you'd double-cross me.

721
01:10:56,166 --> 01:10:57,861
What did Clare say about me?

722
01:10:58,035 --> 01:10:59,263
We didn't discuss you.

723
01:10:59,436 --> 01:11:02,166
What did you talk about?
The weather?

724
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:06,437
Now wait a minute, I know you've
got a hangover, and you're nervous...

725
01:11:06,610 --> 01:11:10,068
...about the show, and you've
got to let off steam on somebody...

726
01:11:10,247 --> 01:11:13,216
...but please, don't say
anything we might both regret.

727
01:11:13,384 --> 01:11:15,147
You're getting sensitive, aren't you?

728
01:11:15,319 --> 01:11:19,847
No, I'm getting fed up with the way
you're acting, if that's what you mean.

729
01:11:20,024 --> 01:11:23,721
Oh, pardon me, I'm only
the leading man in the show.

730
01:11:23,894 --> 01:11:26,055
Take Clare out,
make her late for rehearsals...

731
01:11:26,230 --> 01:11:28,664
...so long as you get yourself
in nice and solid.

732
01:11:28,832 --> 01:11:30,857
Don't worry about making
a monkey out of me.

733
01:11:31,035 --> 01:11:33,333
I'm only the guy
that's got his name up in lights.

734
01:11:33,504 --> 01:11:37,600
Listen, King. When success goes
to a dancer's feet, he's all right...

735
01:11:37,775 --> 01:11:40,869
...but when it goes to his head,
he's top-heavy.

736
01:11:41,045 --> 01:11:43,513
Say, where do you get off
to talk to me like this?

737
01:11:43,681 --> 01:11:46,115
I'm wise to you. You're too smart.

738
01:11:46,283 --> 01:11:49,013
It was clever how you got
that story mixed up this morning...

739
01:11:49,186 --> 01:11:51,177
...to put me in bad
with Matthews and Clare.

740
01:11:51,355 --> 01:11:53,755
Then you take her
to lunch and do a little chiseling.

741
01:11:53,924 --> 01:11:56,051
"It's too bad about King, isn't it?

742
01:11:56,226 --> 01:11:58,421
Now, if I was in his shoes..."

743
01:11:58,596 --> 01:12:01,087
I don't know why
I don't take a poke at you.

744
01:12:01,265 --> 01:12:04,359
I know why you don't.
Because you haven't got it in you.

745
01:12:04,535 --> 01:12:07,402
A guy that can't take it,
can't give it, and that's you.

746
01:12:07,571 --> 01:12:10,836
You've proved that since you got
tripped up by a little bit of success.

747
01:12:11,008 --> 01:12:14,068
You're not even on the level
with yourself. You're always acting.

748
01:12:14,244 --> 01:12:17,702
Well, one of your audience is walking
out on you right now, and that's me.

749
01:12:17,881 --> 01:12:20,406
- You're staying till the show opens!
- That's what you think!

750
01:12:20,584 --> 01:12:21,710
Okay!

751
01:12:21,885 --> 01:12:23,045
Hey, you!

752
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:24,619
Come back here!

753
01:12:24,788 --> 01:12:26,813
The yes man says no!

754
01:12:33,564 --> 01:12:36,032
All right. From the beginning.
And make it good.

755
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:37,929
Don't stop for anything.
On your toes!

756
01:12:38,102 --> 01:12:40,297
Here, here! Stop! Hold everything!

757
01:12:40,471 --> 01:12:43,770
I have just made
the greatest discovery of my life!

758
01:12:43,941 --> 01:12:46,466
- Will you go away?
- No, but you don't understand.

759
01:12:46,644 --> 01:12:48,669
This is sensational.
You've got to see it!

760
01:12:48,846 --> 01:12:50,507
It's a man on a one-wheeled bicycle.

761
01:12:50,681 --> 01:12:54,117
He's way up here, and he rides out
from the wings like the wind...

762
01:12:54,284 --> 01:12:57,947
...and he comes out here
and stops on a dime! Lt'll kill you!

763
01:12:58,122 --> 01:13:00,249
Are you ready, the Great Capolio?

764
01:13:00,424 --> 01:13:03,222
Sit down, everybody. Come on now.

765
01:13:03,394 --> 01:13:06,795
Give us a roll on the drums and...
On your mark!

766
01:13:06,964 --> 01:13:09,091
Get set! Go!

767
01:13:34,591 --> 01:13:36,286
Stop stroking that cape so much.

768
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:39,054
- Yes, darling.
- And don't call me darling.

769
01:13:39,229 --> 01:13:41,891
Only reason I brought you
is because I had to put the cape...

770
01:13:42,066 --> 01:13:44,261
...on somebody, and I'm
too nervous for a struggle.

771
01:13:44,435 --> 01:13:46,562
- Good evening, Mr. Matthews.
- Good evening.

772
01:13:46,737 --> 01:13:48,967
Oh, good evening
and good luck, Mr. Matthews.

773
01:13:49,139 --> 01:13:50,868
A very good evening
to you, Mr. Casey.

774
01:13:51,041 --> 01:13:52,303
- Good luck.
- Thanks, Amy.

775
01:13:52,476 --> 01:13:54,205
- Good evening.
- Hello.

776
01:13:55,612 --> 01:13:57,045
- Mr. Matthews.
- Good evening.

777
01:13:57,214 --> 01:13:59,614
Hello. How are...?

778
01:13:59,783 --> 01:14:02,547
This place is just crowded
with memories.

779
01:14:10,327 --> 01:14:13,455
One row further back and we'd
have a good view of Broadway too.

780
01:14:13,630 --> 01:14:16,531
Well, I like to sit in the back.
I can get out quickly.

781
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:18,531
You expecting trouble?

782
01:14:18,702 --> 01:14:22,433
- Program, Mr. Casey?
- No, I know who's in the cast.

783
01:14:25,509 --> 01:14:27,739
- Aren't they late coming in?
- Yes.

784
01:14:27,911 --> 01:14:31,176
I'd better tell Bert to hold
the curtain a few minutes. Excuse me.

785
01:14:31,348 --> 01:14:32,337
Johnny!

786
01:14:32,516 --> 01:14:34,643
- Oh, hello, Mr. Casey.
- I'm glad to see you.

787
01:14:34,818 --> 01:14:35,876
Thanks.

788
01:14:36,053 --> 01:14:37,953
Well, your pal had better
be good tonight.

789
01:14:38,122 --> 01:14:39,987
Don't worry, Mr. Casey, he will be.

790
01:14:40,157 --> 01:14:42,557
I'd feel a lot better
about it if you were up there.

791
01:14:42,726 --> 01:14:45,889
Don't talk like that.
He'll be swell. Just you wait.

792
01:14:46,063 --> 01:14:49,032
I hope you're right.

793
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:52,327
Will you excuse me? I can't let
King go on without wishing him luck.

794
01:14:52,503 --> 01:14:53,902
Nice going.

795
01:14:56,373 --> 01:14:58,500
- Johnny!
- Hello, Clare.

796
01:14:58,675 --> 01:15:01,337
Your flowers were beautiful,
Johnny. Thanks.

797
01:15:01,512 --> 01:15:02,501
It's nothing.

798
01:15:02,679 --> 01:15:05,045
Why weren't you
at dress rehearsal last night?

799
01:15:05,215 --> 01:15:07,945
I went out dancing.

800
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,454
Well, I'm glad to see you.

801
01:15:11,622 --> 01:15:13,954
- All the luck in the world, Clare.
- Thanks, Johnny.

802
01:15:14,124 --> 01:15:16,058
- Oh, Miss Bennett.
- Coming.

803
01:15:16,226 --> 01:15:18,285
Keep your fingers crossed.

804
01:15:34,278 --> 01:15:36,041
Well, well, well!

805
01:15:36,513 --> 01:15:37,775
Look who's here!

806
01:15:38,782 --> 01:15:40,750
I knew you'd come back.

807
01:15:40,918 --> 01:15:43,910
What's the matter? Why aren't
you dressed? You gotta go on!

808
01:15:44,087 --> 01:15:46,920
Don't tell me what I gotta do.

809
01:15:47,925 --> 01:15:49,950
I'll knock 'em dead!

810
01:15:50,627 --> 01:15:53,027
Come on, get your makeup on!

811
01:15:53,197 --> 01:15:54,892
- Gotta get made-up.
- Yeah, come on!

812
01:15:55,065 --> 01:15:57,590
Gotta get made-up!
Gotta get ma...!

813
01:15:57,768 --> 01:15:58,757
Shut up!

814
01:15:58,936 --> 01:16:01,700
Do you want everybody
in the theater to know you're tight?

815
01:16:10,013 --> 01:16:12,641
There you are. Made-up.

816
01:16:13,217 --> 01:16:15,481
Overture, Mr. Shaw.

817
01:16:17,387 --> 01:16:22,552
- Wait! You can't go out like that!
- Who says I can't? Get out of my way.

818
01:16:23,493 --> 01:16:26,656
Oh, so that's why you came back?

819
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:29,697
Trying to keep me from going on.

820
01:16:29,867 --> 01:16:32,927
Still trying to double-cross me?

821
01:16:33,103 --> 01:16:35,469
Just like you did with Clare.

822
01:16:35,639 --> 01:16:38,301
Come on, King. Use your head!

823
01:16:39,776 --> 01:16:42,745
I don't like you!

824
01:16:45,949 --> 01:16:47,644
King!

825
01:17:12,309 --> 01:17:14,436
Come on, boy. Come on!

826
01:17:18,749 --> 01:17:21,843
On-stage, please!
On-stage, Mr. Shaw!

827
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:06,134
Johnny!
What's the matter with King?

828
01:21:06,309 --> 01:21:08,539
Don't worry. I'll tell you later.

829
01:24:02,452 --> 01:24:07,014
I'll get him ready for his next number.
You won't say anything? Please, Clare.

830
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:13,727
Here, here.
You gotta help yourself a little.

831
01:24:18,068 --> 01:24:20,764
What I want to know is,
what happened?

832
01:24:20,937 --> 01:24:24,168
- You keeled over when you came off.
- When l...?

833
01:24:28,678 --> 01:24:31,909
- When I came off?
- Yeah. You fainted in the wings.

834
01:24:32,082 --> 01:24:35,984
You were pretty fried when you went on,
and with all the turns and everything...

835
01:24:36,152 --> 01:24:38,643
...you were lucky to get
through the number.

836
01:24:38,822 --> 01:24:39,880
Here.

837
01:24:40,056 --> 01:24:41,921
Get into this.

838
01:24:42,525 --> 01:24:46,086
- Well, how was I?
- Swell.

839
01:24:47,697 --> 01:24:51,428
Gosh, I don't remember.

840
01:24:52,602 --> 01:24:55,196
I don't remember anything.

841
01:24:56,072 --> 01:24:59,371
Say, what are you
doing with my robe on?

842
01:25:00,643 --> 01:25:03,134
You almost drowned me when
I put you under the shower.

843
01:25:03,313 --> 01:25:05,508
Here, take another whiff of this.

844
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:08,645
Great work, King. Keep it up!

845
01:25:08,818 --> 01:25:10,410
Oh, thanks, Bert.

846
01:25:10,587 --> 01:25:12,953
You haven't seen anything.

847
01:25:14,891 --> 01:25:17,724
Say, I must have been good.

848
01:25:18,495 --> 01:25:20,486
How was Clare?

849
01:25:21,431 --> 01:25:23,729
Here, let me fix that.

850
01:25:27,203 --> 01:25:28,670
Stand still, will you?

851
01:25:28,838 --> 01:25:31,966
What's the matter? Are you sore
because I'm putting the show over?

852
01:25:32,142 --> 01:25:34,303
- On-stage, Mr. Shaw.
- Coming.

853
01:25:36,579 --> 01:25:40,242
If you really want to see something
good, catch me in this next number.

854
01:25:40,417 --> 01:25:41,975
Thanks. I've seen enough.

855
01:26:06,709 --> 01:26:09,234
Clare! Well, well.

856
01:26:09,412 --> 01:26:12,677
The more you know about women,
the less you know about women.

857
01:26:12,849 --> 01:26:16,114
I was beginning to think I had a
permanent lease behind the eight ball.

858
01:26:16,286 --> 01:26:19,221
What did you think of the notices?
Nothing but raves.

859
01:26:19,389 --> 01:26:23,758
- I'm glad you're satisfied.
- Oh, well, it wasn't all me.

860
01:26:23,927 --> 01:26:27,021
I came to talk to Johnny and you
about last night. Where is he?

861
01:26:27,197 --> 01:26:29,529
Johnny? He's gone.

862
01:26:29,699 --> 01:26:32,259
- Where?
- I don't know and I don't care.

863
01:26:33,336 --> 01:26:35,702
So you don't care?

864
01:26:36,339 --> 01:26:40,070
Well, if the newspapers had printed
the truth this morning, you'd have read:

865
01:26:40,243 --> 01:26:43,701
"While King Shaw passed out drunk
in his dressing room, not even knowing...

866
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:47,782
...that the show had started, a new star
was born to Broadway, Johnny Brett!"

867
01:26:47,951 --> 01:26:50,215
Well, what are you talking about?

868
01:26:50,386 --> 01:26:53,253
I'm talking about
your first number, Mr. Shaw.

869
01:26:53,423 --> 01:26:55,448
The number they're all raving about.

870
01:26:55,625 --> 01:26:57,991
He handed you a career
on a silver platter.

871
01:26:58,161 --> 01:27:01,995
And personally,
I don't think you're worth it!

872
01:27:13,776 --> 01:27:15,710
- Good evening, Pop.
- Good evening, Miss Bennett.

873
01:27:15,879 --> 01:27:20,145
There's your mail. I gave the key
to your dressing room to Mr. Shaw.

874
01:27:20,316 --> 01:27:23,342
- Mr. Shaw?
- Yes, miss.

875
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:26,284
Half-hour. Half-hour.

876
01:27:26,456 --> 01:27:28,686
- Good evening, Miss Bennett.
- Good evening.

877
01:27:42,839 --> 01:27:45,069
- Angel!
- Yes, ma'am.

878
01:27:45,241 --> 01:27:48,574
- Give these back to Mr. Shaw.
- Yes, ma'am.

879
01:28:07,997 --> 01:28:10,397
I'm sorry you didn't like my roses.

880
01:28:10,567 --> 01:28:13,593
I picked them for you myself.
Well, what's the matter?

881
01:28:13,770 --> 01:28:16,000
You'll never be able to go on.

882
01:28:16,172 --> 01:28:18,106
Well, who cares?

883
01:28:18,274 --> 01:28:20,401
Don't want to be able to go on.

884
01:28:20,577 --> 01:28:23,307
You ought never
to be allowed in the theater again!

885
01:28:23,479 --> 01:28:27,540
She loves me. She loves me not.

886
01:28:27,717 --> 01:28:29,446
Where's Johnny?

887
01:28:29,619 --> 01:28:32,782
Don't you wish
you knew where he was?

888
01:28:33,189 --> 01:28:36,317
Well, I know where he is,
but I ain't saying!

889
01:28:36,492 --> 01:28:38,483
Where is Johnny?

890
01:28:38,661 --> 01:28:41,789
- Go on, guess.
- Where is he?

891
01:28:41,965 --> 01:28:47,198
He's down at the Dawnland Ballroom,
right where he belongs.

892
01:28:48,471 --> 01:28:50,405
Bob! King's in there drunk.

893
01:28:50,573 --> 01:28:54,202
Take him to your office until you hear
from me. I'm going to find Johnny.

894
01:28:54,377 --> 01:28:56,504
Drunk? That's terrible. My show!

895
01:29:19,235 --> 01:29:21,100
Johnny! Johnny!

896
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:24,398
- Clare! What...?
- I've got to see you. I must!

897
01:29:24,574 --> 01:29:27,202
Right after this is over,
wait for me.

898
01:29:34,217 --> 01:29:38,244
Clare! This isn't mine! Clare!

899
01:29:40,723 --> 01:29:43,624
Clare, you didn't think I'd...?
I mean, it's the other fella's!

900
01:29:43,793 --> 01:29:45,784
- I mean, I wasn't...
- You mean, you weren't...?

901
01:29:45,962 --> 01:29:47,930
- Do you think I'd...?
- Johnny, I was so...

902
01:29:48,097 --> 01:29:50,531
I mean... Johnny, come on!

903
01:29:51,134 --> 01:29:55,366
Hello? What's that?
They found Johnny?

904
01:29:55,538 --> 01:29:57,699
They found him! They found him!

905
01:29:57,874 --> 01:29:59,398
Why, Mr. Casey!

906
01:29:59,575 --> 01:30:00,837
Oh, yes, well, come on.

907
01:30:01,010 --> 01:30:02,773
What are you gonna do
with the body?

908
01:30:02,945 --> 01:30:05,812
- Do you think he's still unconscious?
- And how!

909
01:30:05,982 --> 01:30:07,540
All right. Now, young man.

910
01:30:07,717 --> 01:30:10,049
Now, you can consider
this your two-weeks notice.

911
01:30:10,219 --> 01:30:12,483
You're fired! Come on.

912
01:40:02,011 --> 01:40:06,573
Here's your drunk.
He's as good an actor off as he is on!

913
01:40:07,349 --> 01:40:11,251
- Who do you love?
- You! You! You!

914
01:40:12,588 --> 01:40:14,317
Oh, no! Johnny! No, no!

915
01:41:41,643 --> 01:41:42,632
