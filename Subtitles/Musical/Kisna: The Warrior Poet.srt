1
00:01:05,987 --> 00:01:09,479
The waters... The land...
And the sky...

2
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:13,856
...Are proof to the history
Of mankind.

3
00:01:16,198 --> 00:01:20,157
People... countries... Time...
Everything changes...

4
00:01:22,237 --> 00:01:25,172
Nothing survives forever...
But true love.

5
00:01:26,274 --> 00:01:28,834
In the name of true love is...

6
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:18,144
Whenever the populous 10 billion
Of india celebrate republic day...

7
00:03:18,653 --> 00:03:20,621
...There's always something
special.

8
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:25,148
This year the government and
The media have their attention...

9
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,825
...On a special guest
Lady katherine williams.

10
00:03:29,397 --> 00:03:34,596
"Ironically, she's refusing to talk
To both - government and press."

11
00:03:35,236 --> 00:03:37,761
She's even avoiding a
Photographer...!

12
00:03:38,273 --> 00:03:39,831
"A former minister

13
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,505
Of the british government..."

14
00:03:41,876 --> 00:03:44,504
...ls today the
state guest of india...

15
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,647
...Because of her interest in
Rural development and education.

16
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:56,919
For this she has with her a charity
fund of 500 million pounds.

17
00:03:57,492 --> 00:03:59,790
"All the chief ministers around the

18
00:04:00,228 --> 00:04:02,128
country have invited her."

19
00:04:02,631 --> 00:04:08,570
But she declined till she meets
The prime minister or president.

20
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:13,573
"To welcome her, present are
Ministers and known people of delhi."

21
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:20,141
"All praised her at length but
she just said one word..."

22
00:04:20,515 --> 00:04:22,142
What...?
- Namaste.

23
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,647
Well said.

24
00:04:24,185 --> 00:04:31,489
"Lets' watch to whom will her
charity fund go to, if at all."

25
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:37,489
She has refused the ministry's
Invitations to tour india.

26
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:14,529
"I'm the secretary to
Minister of tourism."

27
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:31,608
"Please explain, our government's
In an awkward situation."

28
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:38,152
"But if madam doesn't wish to tour,
You can't force her."

29
00:05:40,195 --> 00:05:43,164
"It's essential for madam to
Get to know our country."

30
00:05:47,268 --> 00:05:50,704
"You want madam to see
India in the truest sense?"

31
00:05:52,207 --> 00:05:55,836
"We've already invited
Her to sightsee india."

32
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:03,715
"If you really want her to
see india..."

33
00:06:04,152 --> 00:06:07,713
"...Then take her to devprayag"

34
00:06:19,267 --> 00:06:24,136
"Devprayag, a holy place in
Uttaranchal where two rivers..."

35
00:06:24,572 --> 00:06:26,802
...Bhagirath and alaknanda merge...

36
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:31,812
"...To form the holiest river ganges,
Above rishikesh and haridwar."

37
00:06:36,184 --> 00:06:38,152
Now what's your decision?

38
00:09:52,847 --> 00:09:54,144
Thank you.

39
00:09:57,185 --> 00:09:58,812
How rude is that?!

40
00:10:00,188 --> 00:10:04,648
"Either she doesn't know india or
Doesn't want to know india..."

41
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:07,159
It's all a charade!

42
00:10:08,997 --> 00:10:15,835
"I know india very well..."

43
00:10:17,205 --> 00:10:20,868
"More than you, the real india."

44
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,178
It's not a charade.

45
00:10:27,315 --> 00:10:31,649
"India has a thousand stories..."

46
00:10:32,353 --> 00:10:35,516
"But I've just one story to share..."

47
00:10:43,264 --> 00:10:46,665
"Now even I can't hold
Myself back"

48
00:11:13,261 --> 00:11:15,729
Do you see that bungalow...

49
00:11:17,198 --> 00:11:19,166
...Now a hotel I guess...

50
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:22,169
...lt was my home...

51
00:11:22,737 --> 00:11:24,705
My birthplace.

52
00:11:26,507 --> 00:11:28,475
Lady katherine says...

53
00:11:29,644 --> 00:11:32,841
Do you see that bungalow there,
It was my home

54
00:11:33,381 --> 00:11:36,839
In 1930, I was born here.

55
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,517
In india.

56
00:11:40,922 --> 00:11:43,516
"Before 1947, during british rule..."

57
00:11:43,891 --> 00:11:46,860
My father and grandfather
Also lived in india.

58
00:11:49,597 --> 00:11:51,565
"My father peter beckett was
The deputy commissioner..."

59
00:11:51,732 --> 00:11:53,199
"...Of pauri garhwal.

60
00:11:53,668 --> 00:11:57,627
But the villagers hated him."

61
00:12:45,486 --> 00:12:50,856
"Kathy baby, my sweetheart,
This is for you."

62
00:12:52,226 --> 00:12:53,784
Where's kisna?

63
00:12:54,662 --> 00:12:57,563
Where he usually is...!

64
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:13,139
What's it?
- Here's a gift for you.

65
00:13:19,187 --> 00:13:20,677
What's it?

66
00:13:34,202 --> 00:13:35,965
I don't like such jokes.

67
00:13:36,637 --> 00:13:38,605
Go away, let me work!

68
00:13:43,277 --> 00:13:44,744
Now what?

69
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:53,182
Just like an officer.

70
00:13:53,487 --> 00:13:55,284
Salute the officer.

71
00:13:56,224 --> 00:13:57,521
Salute officer!

72
00:14:01,295 --> 00:14:03,263
"Do you think I'm an idiot?

73
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:06,529
It's a girls' hat, not for boys!"

74
00:14:13,608 --> 00:14:19,569
"Sing a song that touches my heart"

75
00:14:23,384 --> 00:14:27,480
My grandpa's calling you
for the prayer ceremony!

76
00:14:27,888 --> 00:14:30,152
Can't come, I'm on duty!

77
00:14:31,192 --> 00:14:33,160
"Luxmi, come with us."

78
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,172
Grandpa...
- Yes my dear...

79
00:14:57,218 --> 00:15:01,712
Kisna chases me away
Whenever kathy's around.

80
00:15:03,658 --> 00:15:06,627
He's my student.
He'd never do that.

81
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:12,622
He does! Kathy braids
Her hair as if to copy me!

82
00:15:14,502 --> 00:15:21,465
Just immerse yourself into the
World of music and dance...

83
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:23,504
And pray to lord krishna.

84
00:15:24,178 --> 00:15:27,147
He'll be yours.

85
00:15:28,182 --> 00:15:29,809
Kisna doesn't care about me.

86
00:15:32,219 --> 00:15:33,811
Just close your eyes.

87
00:15:34,255 --> 00:15:36,155
Now turn southwards...

88
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,427
...Now open your eyes.

89
00:15:41,195 --> 00:15:43,823
Isn't that kisna!

90
00:15:49,236 --> 00:15:52,171
This is your english lesson book.

91
00:15:52,907 --> 00:15:55,876
Learn it by monday."

92
00:15:57,678 --> 00:15:59,771
I've completed this homework too.

93
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:08,452
"May I enter the piano room
To look at the piano."

94
00:16:08,923 --> 00:16:10,788
Of course... why not...

95
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:26,572
I don't want any useless indian
In that room!

96
00:16:44,992 --> 00:16:49,622
"Every religion teaches the
Path of love and peace."

97
00:16:50,231 --> 00:16:52,165
"Says our holy book, the gita."

98
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:54,501
"If one doesn't follow
This path?"

99
00:16:54,869 --> 00:16:56,837
It becomes our duty to fight.

100
00:16:57,204 --> 00:16:59,502
Even if he's your own master?

101
00:17:00,908 --> 00:17:02,876
Be it your master or brother...

102
00:17:03,644 --> 00:17:05,612
fight for justice is righteousness.

103
00:17:06,147 --> 00:17:07,774
Got that kisna?

104
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,778
Half knowledge is dangerous!

105
00:17:17,158 --> 00:17:24,690
"My sister shanta's moulding
Her children into scholars..."

106
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:28,132
"...Whereas to fight the british
We need warriors!"

107
00:17:29,236 --> 00:17:31,397
"We've you, bhairo,
Leader of warriors!"

108
00:17:31,672 --> 00:17:33,537
"Shankar's following your
footsteps!"

109
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:38,701
"Yes, my shankar's not a slave
Like kisna and you."

110
00:17:39,313 --> 00:17:43,716
"Time and again the two of you fight
Over the same issue."

111
00:17:44,185 --> 00:17:50,590
Beckett's routed the canal water
To the wretched prince raghuraj.

112
00:17:52,193 --> 00:17:54,491
I'll skin him alive one day...

113
00:17:54,862 --> 00:17:56,830
Even if he's your master!

114
00:17:57,798 --> 00:18:00,528
"Who'll stop you from your
Temperament of bloodshed!

115
00:18:01,168 --> 00:18:04,569
"Since beckett's banned all
Your illegal trade..."

116
00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:11,102
"...You're faking to be a radical
Leader of the poor villagers!"

117
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:20,580
"This is the katau canal of
Pauri garhwal, which belongs to me."

118
00:18:22,823 --> 00:18:30,127
I've paid your government huge
Taxes and helped in your business.

119
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:39,128
I need you to guard my canal from
Misuse by bhairo and his miscreants.

120
00:18:55,356 --> 00:19:01,761
"Listen to the melody
And follow me."

121
00:20:45,232 --> 00:20:49,191
Mother didn't have the courage
To go against father's decision.

122
00:20:51,572 --> 00:20:55,201
"I was packed off to london the
very same day."

123
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:02,613
"But my childhood was attached to
scents of this village."

124
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:11,157
"In england, my aunt margaret
Put me in a public school."

125
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:18,162
"But I never forgot devprayag,
Kisna and his flute."

126
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:20,662
Time went by...

127
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:26,168
"In 1947, the british government
started talks of independence..."

128
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,508
...With gandhi and nehru.

129
00:21:36,216 --> 00:21:41,620
On my mother's insistence,
My father called me back to india.

130
00:21:48,996 --> 00:21:51,965
On reaching india, my happiness
Knew no bounds.

131
00:21:53,901 --> 00:21:57,894
Nothing had changed, neither
The villages or the mountains...

132
00:21:58,505 --> 00:22:00,564
...Nor the rivers or the people!

133
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:03,677
Felt like childhood days again.

134
00:22:18,726 --> 00:22:22,162
We are a family now...

135
00:22:40,614 --> 00:22:43,174
My sweetheart!
- Recognize me?

136
00:22:44,218 --> 00:22:45,845
How can I ever forget you?
This flower reminded me of you!

137
00:22:55,262 --> 00:22:56,854
Kisna... How's he?!

138
00:22:57,431 --> 00:22:58,864
He's fine...

139
00:22:59,233 --> 00:23:00,791
What does he do?

140
00:23:01,201 --> 00:23:04,136
He's finished studies, works
With his brother...

141
00:23:04,338 --> 00:23:05,828
...And teaches the children too.

142
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,140
Did kisna miss me?

143
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:12,310
Yes... but...

144
00:23:17,451 --> 00:23:19,146
What happened?

145
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,154
Since you'd left, everything
Has changed...

146
00:23:24,191 --> 00:23:27,820
...from people to government
To politics!

147
00:23:30,197 --> 00:23:32,165
A rage of hatred has taken over.

148
00:23:34,868 --> 00:23:36,836
Especially against your father.

149
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:46,771
All over india, people are
Resuming to peace, except here.

150
00:23:48,215 --> 00:23:49,842
And kisna?

151
00:23:51,218 --> 00:23:53,846
Even flowers get affected in
A sandstorm.

152
00:23:57,758 --> 00:23:59,191
And luxmi?

153
00:24:00,227 --> 00:24:01,854
She's still devoted to
Lord krishna.

154
00:24:07,868 --> 00:24:15,138
"My god is in me"

155
00:24:18,345 --> 00:24:23,146
"Do I need to go to a temple
In search of god?"

156
00:24:29,189 --> 00:24:35,150
"This existence is god..."

157
00:24:42,436 --> 00:24:47,499
"I find you everywhere"

158
00:24:58,285 --> 00:25:05,453
"Within me is the destroyer,
Preserver, creator..."

159
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,127
"...And lord krishna!"

160
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:47,161
"My god is in me!"

161
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:34,647
"Beckett's daughter,
Katherine is back!"

162
00:26:35,182 --> 00:26:37,480
"Apparently she's beautiful.
- Want to marry her?"

163
00:26:37,884 --> 00:26:40,148
"Crazy? Who'd want to marry
A white girl?!"

164
00:26:48,929 --> 00:26:51,489
Kisna... Where are you going?

165
00:26:52,466 --> 00:26:54,434
I'll be right back my brother.

166
00:27:21,161 --> 00:27:22,458
Recognize me?

167
00:27:22,829 --> 00:27:26,663
Yes... You are
Ms. Katherine beckett.

168
00:27:28,168 --> 00:27:31,660
Daughter of our master
Mr. Peter beckett.

169
00:27:39,413 --> 00:27:41,142
My father has been unfair.

170
00:27:43,183 --> 00:27:45,151
Your father told me everything.

171
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:58,654
Does this politics affect
Our friendship?

172
00:28:26,259 --> 00:28:27,556
Beautiful...

173
00:28:30,163 --> 00:28:33,530
Guess, whose flute is this?

174
00:28:35,602 --> 00:28:41,472
It's mine... when your father...

175
00:28:43,176 --> 00:28:50,139
sent me away from india,
You and all my friends.

176
00:28:53,186 --> 00:28:57,145
"How did you learn our guru's
Tune of aham brahmasmi?

177
00:28:57,624 --> 00:29:00,525
Just the way you learnt my
Mother's piano notes.

178
00:29:01,561 --> 00:29:04,291
I've written a song to that tune.

179
00:29:07,134 --> 00:29:11,093
You speak fluent hindi too.
- Absolutely.

180
00:29:11,538 --> 00:29:12,505
Beautiful...

181
00:29:12,706 --> 00:29:14,435
Truly beautiful...

182
00:29:19,646 --> 00:29:21,773
Remember this?

183
00:29:24,151 --> 00:29:26,119
Jaggery... you loved it as a child.

184
00:29:30,157 --> 00:29:32,125
Give me this flute...

185
00:29:32,926 --> 00:29:34,791
It's mine.
- Now this flute belongs to me.

186
00:29:35,162 --> 00:29:36,459
Fine, keep it.

187
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:40,126
"Do you remember...
That's devprayag there!"

188
00:29:45,939 --> 00:29:48,134
"Kisna, what's the song you've
Written?"

189
00:29:49,176 --> 00:29:51,144
"Want to hear it?
- Certainly!"

190
00:29:55,916 --> 00:29:59,147
"We're here, this moment together"

191
00:30:02,455 --> 00:30:05,583
"Don't know what tomorrow holds"

192
00:30:13,633 --> 00:30:16,693
"We may, may not come together"

193
00:30:18,205 --> 00:30:21,174
"We may, may not see forever"

194
00:30:22,309 --> 00:30:30,273
"Nothing survives forever...
But love"

195
00:30:31,318 --> 00:30:38,520
"A love that will always echo...
On this land and the sky above"

196
00:32:03,176 --> 00:32:07,135
I understand you are
Against my child...

197
00:32:10,183 --> 00:32:14,142
He spent an entire day with
That british girl.

198
00:32:15,889 --> 00:32:17,857
Travelled up to devprayag!

199
00:32:19,492 --> 00:32:21,460
Like they're meant for each other.

200
00:32:22,529 --> 00:32:24,690
You are misjudging him.

201
00:32:26,733 --> 00:32:29,167
I've a solution.

202
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,608
Will you marry kisna?

203
00:32:49,756 --> 00:32:51,724
Mother, is it true that
My marriage...

204
00:32:52,225 --> 00:32:54,853
Yes, we've fixed it with luxmi.

205
00:32:55,662 --> 00:32:58,688
But I don't want to marry now.

206
00:32:59,232 --> 00:33:01,132
I've to work lots for the school.

207
00:33:01,501 --> 00:33:07,565
Ask your elder brother to
Break our family promise!

208
00:33:08,174 --> 00:33:11,143
No, we've to keep our promise
To our guru...

209
00:33:12,178 --> 00:33:14,669
You've to respect the word
Of elders.

210
00:33:15,615 --> 00:33:18,140
Engagement's day after
Marriage's next month.

211
00:33:24,824 --> 00:33:26,587
Lets' go for training...

212
00:33:26,893 --> 00:33:28,758
Uncle bhairo's waiting for us.

213
00:33:33,867 --> 00:33:36,165
"My dear, I've bought this
Horse for you."

214
00:33:36,603 --> 00:33:39,163
We'll go horse riding
Every evening...

215
00:33:40,206 --> 00:33:41,764
"for me, why?"

216
00:33:42,242 --> 00:33:44,176
Because I love you.

217
00:33:46,546 --> 00:33:48,741
But you're like my uncle!

218
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:53,280
Like an uncle, not really one.

219
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,844
I'm crazy about you.

220
00:33:56,222 --> 00:33:58,190
I want to marry you.

221
00:34:41,801 --> 00:34:43,769
Kisna's getting engaged
Tomorrow...

222
00:34:45,205 --> 00:34:47,730
...With luxmi.
- With luxmi?

223
00:34:48,274 --> 00:34:50,834
It was such a surprise...

224
00:34:51,544 --> 00:34:58,177
Our guru offered luxmi's
Hand in marriage for kisna.

225
00:34:59,486 --> 00:35:03,547
There couldn't be a better match!

226
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:58,634
"Lets' get this girl ready on
Her special day."

227
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:11,914
"Lets' adorn this charming
Girl with jewellery."

228
00:36:29,609 --> 00:36:37,573
"I've been waiting for this
Day all my life..."

229
00:36:38,451 --> 00:36:44,583
"...To be with you, my love."

230
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:01,597
"As fresh as a flower..."

231
00:37:02,208 --> 00:37:06,110
"This girl is soon to be a bride"

232
00:37:06,546 --> 00:37:10,448
"Her lips look a lovely red"

233
00:37:10,817 --> 00:37:14,583
"My girl's looking exquisite..."

234
00:37:19,425 --> 00:37:23,555
"Like morning sunrays
Through clouds so blue"

235
00:37:28,334 --> 00:37:32,464
"The moment your bridegroom
Will look at you..."

236
00:37:32,872 --> 00:37:36,137
"He'll fall in love with you"

237
00:37:36,576 --> 00:37:44,540
"The most awaited day is here"

238
00:37:45,518 --> 00:37:51,479
"The day when your charming bride
To be is entering our lives"

239
00:38:12,145 --> 00:38:16,445
"I welcome my love..."

240
00:38:20,586 --> 00:38:24,545
"With love"

241
00:38:25,158 --> 00:38:33,122
"I'm crazy about him..."

242
00:39:27,253 --> 00:39:33,556
"I've been counting days
for this day..."

243
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:12,427
"Joyful be the would-be
Bride and bridegroom."

244
00:41:31,711 --> 00:41:34,179
"My mother was annoyed by
My behaviour."

245
00:41:35,748 --> 00:41:39,184
"I told her that kisna is
My best friend."

246
00:41:40,686 --> 00:41:47,854
"She told me that he's
Luxmi's fiance now..."

247
00:41:52,698 --> 00:41:55,531
"This friendship won't
Be appreciated by anyone..."

248
00:41:57,236 --> 00:41:59,204
...Especially by luxmi.

249
00:42:00,006 --> 00:42:06,639
"My mother explained that
The hatred against the british..."

250
00:42:07,179 --> 00:42:11,809
"...Will remain till we
Don't leave their country."

251
00:42:28,267 --> 00:42:29,825
Make eye contact.

252
00:42:30,202 --> 00:42:32,830
Defend! Yes, now strike back.

253
00:42:33,873 --> 00:42:34,840
Come on...

254
00:42:35,241 --> 00:42:37,175
can we continue tomorrow?
- No excuses!

255
00:42:39,211 --> 00:42:41,179
Can I practice with gaurang?

256
00:42:41,714 --> 00:42:43,682
I dare not raise
My sword upon you.

257
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:48,179
Damn the poet...
Grow as a warrior now!

258
00:43:03,302 --> 00:43:06,669
"Villagers are dying drinking
Water from the dirty lake."

259
00:43:07,206 --> 00:43:09,800
Five died last week.

260
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:17,312
We need a revolutionary like
Bhagat singh in our village...

261
00:43:18,351 --> 00:43:21,582
...To take care of that
Ruthless beckett!

262
00:43:26,192 --> 00:43:30,151
I may not be bhagat singh but
I am shankar singh!

263
00:43:45,478 --> 00:43:47,446
"These are five dead bodies."

264
00:43:48,214 --> 00:43:52,583
"Three men, a child and
An old lady."

265
00:43:53,219 --> 00:43:55,779
All died drinking water
from that dirty lake...

266
00:43:56,222 --> 00:43:59,191
...That's given to us as alms!

267
00:43:59,492 --> 00:44:01,119
So, what do I do?

268
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,328
Nothing...

269
00:44:04,163 --> 00:44:08,122
Now, we'll take care of everything.

270
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:16,130
The people who die because of
That water will be...

271
00:44:17,176 --> 00:44:23,137
...cremated right here on
Your office grounds.

272
00:45:07,593 --> 00:45:09,720
The five villagers died because
You poisoned them...

273
00:45:10,162 --> 00:45:12,130
...But you've made the rebels
Believe it as beckett's doing.

274
00:45:12,498 --> 00:45:14,466
What do you want?

275
00:45:15,201 --> 00:45:17,669
50 Acres of land on my name.

276
00:45:19,171 --> 00:45:21,139
Revolution is not my aim.

277
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,608
It's just my business.

278
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:26,473
Make beckett understand.

279
00:45:26,679 --> 00:45:31,582
Beckett's gathering evidence
To imprison you.

280
00:45:38,557 --> 00:45:42,152
"A radio announcement was made
On 4th june 1947."

281
00:45:42,661 --> 00:45:46,722
"Lord mountbatten declared
British government's decision..."

282
00:45:47,366 --> 00:45:51,496
"...To give freedom to india
On 15th august 1947."

283
00:45:52,204 --> 00:45:55,662
"The british officers have
To give up their post..."

284
00:45:56,208 --> 00:46:00,770
"...Before 14th august
And return to england."

285
00:46:03,149 --> 00:46:08,109
"Discussions took place on the
Partition of india and pakistan."

286
00:46:19,632 --> 00:46:22,123
"Gandhi appealed to all indians
To observe a prayer for peace."

287
00:46:31,544 --> 00:46:40,509
"May there be peace in space,
Land, waters and the universe..."

288
00:46:48,194 --> 00:46:56,158
"Let peace prevail in the world
And negativities destroyed."

289
00:47:22,161 --> 00:47:24,459
I hope no one is aware of our plan.

290
00:50:13,298 --> 00:50:16,495
Got hold of kisna?
- Searched all over...

291
00:50:17,536 --> 00:50:20,596
"Attacked phunkara despite
Being a younger brother."

292
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:24,609
"Find kisna and confine him.

293
00:50:25,911 --> 00:50:27,879
I'll join you in some time."

294
00:50:35,721 --> 00:50:39,521
"The commissioner's house
Was on fire! All charred."

295
00:51:19,798 --> 00:51:24,758
You have the answer to the
Question in your eyes.

296
00:51:26,338 --> 00:51:28,533
You're reading the gita
since childhood.

297
00:51:28,874 --> 00:51:33,641
To protect an innocent girl is
Not only revering god...

298
00:51:35,681 --> 00:51:37,649
...But also the foremost duty
Of a man.

299
00:51:40,219 --> 00:51:41,345
My brother?

300
00:51:41,587 --> 00:51:48,618
Be it your brother
Or mine, their act is unjust!

301
00:51:53,232 --> 00:51:56,633
A fight against injustice
Is righteousness.

302
00:51:57,236 --> 00:52:00,205
And this girl deserves justice.

303
00:52:01,373 --> 00:52:04,604
You have my blessings.

304
00:52:05,544 --> 00:52:10,641
Take this girl to a british
cantonment or delhi.

305
00:52:13,185 --> 00:52:16,154
It's my order.

306
00:52:21,193 --> 00:52:23,627
"Mother, where are you?
- Coming..."

307
00:53:19,651 --> 00:53:22,142
Luxmi, I saw them flee together.

308
00:53:23,188 --> 00:53:26,646
He got engaged to you
Under the pressure of his family.

309
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:30,487
He's eloped with her!

310
00:53:42,207 --> 00:53:47,645
Mother, he didn't even ask you
Before he chose this perilous path.

311
00:53:48,614 --> 00:53:50,741
I don't know what's
Right or wrong...

312
00:53:51,216 --> 00:53:55,846
...But I know that just
One son will survive!

313
00:53:56,388 --> 00:53:57,855
No my son...!

314
00:53:59,257 --> 00:54:02,124
Choose to pray for whomever you
Want to...

315
00:54:10,636 --> 00:54:13,469
This act of kisna will
Ruin all of us.

316
00:54:22,848 --> 00:54:24,816
"Hey nandu, sing your song!"

317
00:54:29,187 --> 00:54:35,148
"Sing a song that touches
My heart."

318
00:54:36,895 --> 00:54:44,165
"Lets' decide whose songs
Are better."

319
00:54:44,469 --> 00:54:51,739
"I'll sing such songs that
You'll have to agree."

320
00:54:52,611 --> 00:54:59,517
"That my songs are better than
Any song can be."

321
00:55:37,989 --> 00:55:43,621
Kisna, the men hunting for you
Inquired about you to me...

322
00:55:44,396 --> 00:55:46,694
I knew you'd be
Here any moment.

323
00:55:48,467 --> 00:55:53,166
We should stay with you for a
couple of days and then move ahead.

324
00:55:54,206 --> 00:55:56,174
No way...!

325
00:55:56,541 --> 00:56:01,444
My orthodox parent-in-laws,
My wife won't welcome you.

326
00:56:02,147 --> 00:56:04,115
They'll throw me out of
Their house.

327
00:56:06,852 --> 00:56:08,820
I've a way out...

328
00:56:09,488 --> 00:56:13,117
We'll stay at your house
And you won't be thrown out.

329
00:56:16,161 --> 00:56:17,458
How's that?

330
00:56:21,166 --> 00:56:24,465
Mother, my husband is
Bringing guests again...

331
00:56:24,936 --> 00:56:27,700
...Now it's his childhood friend
And his wife.

332
00:56:29,274 --> 00:56:30,798
Here they are!

333
00:56:47,192 --> 00:56:49,160
Guests are like gods!

334
00:56:49,861 --> 00:56:56,323
She's so beautiful and fair...

335
00:56:56,802 --> 00:56:58,326
Just like a british!

336
00:56:58,537 --> 00:57:00,164
She is british.

337
00:57:01,706 --> 00:57:03,435
My respects to you.

338
00:57:04,276 --> 00:57:06,107
Touch her feet.

339
00:57:12,818 --> 00:57:16,379
No problem.
She's british, thus ignorant.

340
00:57:17,455 --> 00:57:19,548
Please forgive her...
she'll learn.

341
00:57:21,159 --> 00:57:27,120
She'll learn.
It's a love marriage.

342
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:32,127
She's the daughter of a british
Officer and he's an indian officer.

343
00:57:32,537 --> 00:57:34,801
As soon as they got the
chance, they got married.

344
00:57:35,273 --> 00:57:38,470
Her father disowned her and
Returned to england.

345
00:57:39,177 --> 00:57:42,806
But she's adapting to hindu ways.

346
00:57:43,281 --> 00:57:45,681
Isn't it?

347
00:57:46,184 --> 00:57:47,674
Yes.

348
00:57:48,186 --> 00:57:50,814
And her name is gangotri!

349
00:57:53,191 --> 00:57:55,421
How long will they stay here?

350
00:57:56,194 --> 00:57:57,422
Two days...

351
00:58:01,132 --> 00:58:04,101
"come, receive blessings from
Her father."

352
00:58:09,341 --> 00:58:11,104
My respects to you.

353
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:15,104
Touch his feet.
- Give the trunk to me!

354
00:58:16,581 --> 00:58:18,549
Bless you with a happy
Married life!

355
00:58:35,433 --> 00:58:37,731
May god soon bless you
With a son!

356
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:40,135
Traditional blessings...

357
00:58:42,507 --> 00:58:45,135
They seem tired, show them
Your room.

358
00:58:45,477 --> 00:58:50,540
I'm giving my all... clothes,
Linen, jewellery, my room!

359
00:58:51,583 --> 00:58:56,145
We're used to sleeping
On the terrace! Isn't it?

360
00:59:01,126 --> 00:59:03,424
I thought you're fast asleep.

361
00:59:04,129 --> 00:59:06,097
Mother sent some milk for you.

362
00:59:08,333 --> 00:59:09,300
Why?

363
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:17,472
Haven't you explained to her
Our customs.

364
00:59:17,909 --> 00:59:19,604
Why don't you explain to her?

365
00:59:22,147 --> 00:59:28,450
Newly weds drink milk...

366
00:59:29,154 --> 00:59:30,382
Yes...?

367
00:59:31,156 --> 00:59:34,648
So that they produce a
Healthy child!

368
00:59:35,393 --> 00:59:37,452
With a glass of milk?

369
00:59:38,163 --> 00:59:40,529
Yes... It does!

370
00:59:42,934 --> 00:59:45,129
Make her understand!

371
00:59:47,172 --> 00:59:48,799
Where are you?

372
00:59:51,676 --> 00:59:53,303
That's so absurd!

373
00:59:53,645 --> 00:59:56,136
It's not absurd, it's our
customs.

374
00:59:57,182 --> 00:59:58,274
Don't bother...

375
01:00:00,418 --> 01:00:02,648
Lets' drink the milk!
- What?!

376
01:00:03,521 --> 01:00:05,489
We'll drink it together.

377
01:00:06,624 --> 01:00:09,593
Good night... just go to sleep!

378
01:00:10,929 --> 01:00:12,897
Don't mull over all this.

379
01:00:14,199 --> 01:00:16,497
But I want to drink!
- Why?

380
01:00:24,676 --> 01:00:27,941
I feel like it and not
To produce a child...

381
01:01:00,645 --> 01:01:06,413
The superintendent can't trace
Katherine but jennifer is found.

382
01:01:13,291 --> 01:01:15,156
Not jennifer, I want katherine.

383
01:01:16,194 --> 01:01:19,823
She's my dream girl.
Find her in 24 hours!

384
01:01:24,669 --> 01:01:28,730
But you've promised to
Make me your princess!

385
01:01:30,608 --> 01:01:33,338
Come, I'll fulfill your dream.

386
01:01:34,979 --> 01:01:38,506
Find katherine or you
Won't remain alive.

387
01:01:59,304 --> 01:02:00,635
What's that?

388
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:06,574
That's a hindu family immersing
The ashes of a late relative...

389
01:02:06,878 --> 01:02:08,345
...ln the ganges.

390
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:09,808
Why?

391
01:02:10,882 --> 01:02:14,477
His soul will attain salvation.
- And...

392
01:02:15,186 --> 01:02:19,555
And he'll achieve his unfulfilled
Wishes in his next birth.

393
01:02:20,625 --> 01:02:21,592
Amazing...!

394
01:02:25,196 --> 01:02:27,164
You've any wish?

395
01:02:47,886 --> 01:02:51,617
Told you that white girl spell
Bound him since childhood.

396
01:02:52,223 --> 01:02:55,522
Eloped with her having made
Enemies out of his own family.

397
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:01,664
Your love has a flaw.
- What flaw?

398
01:03:04,502 --> 01:03:06,470
Your love has no faith.

399
01:03:07,172 --> 01:03:13,133
True love implies faith, patience
And sacrifice. Not jealousy.

400
01:03:13,511 --> 01:03:16,810
Yes, I'm jealous and will remain so.

401
01:03:17,515 --> 01:03:21,144
Jealousy is a part of love.
You always take kisna's side.

402
01:03:22,253 --> 01:03:24,813
Sometimes I feel you're not
My grandpa.

403
01:03:25,623 --> 01:03:27,591
Always consider me in the wrong!

404
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:37,497
"Hail the supreme mother,
My respects to her."

405
01:03:46,411 --> 01:03:48,709
Swear kisna hasn't come.

406
01:03:49,747 --> 01:03:53,183
I would've explained to him,
He's totally in the wrong!

407
01:03:56,387 --> 01:03:58,787
Alright, look out for him.

408
01:04:03,161 --> 01:04:09,464
Let him know, he has offended
His brother, uncle and family.

409
01:04:10,735 --> 01:04:15,695
Has rebelled, the rascal!

410
01:04:17,575 --> 01:04:22,535
He has put all our lives in danger.

411
01:04:24,983 --> 01:04:27,144
That too for a white girl!

412
01:04:33,191 --> 01:04:36,160
Let our informer know if he
comes here. We'll get to know.

413
01:04:47,005 --> 01:04:50,702
Pray to god that I don't ever
confront my brother.

414
01:04:53,211 --> 01:04:56,510
I can fight with anything in life
Except my brother.

415
01:05:00,852 --> 01:05:05,448
It'll be alright. Stay another day.

416
01:05:05,823 --> 01:05:07,654
Let them move ahead.

417
01:05:08,259 --> 01:05:13,458
Anyway today's gangadashmi and
Also a celebration for lord krishna.

418
01:05:28,179 --> 01:05:31,410
My dear poet, did you write a
song for lord krishna celebration?

419
01:05:32,317 --> 01:05:35,480
I've written a song to the tune
That you were just humming.

420
01:05:38,189 --> 01:05:44,526
Just as I thought! Hey rukmani,
We've a new song.

421
01:05:47,298 --> 01:05:49,163
What's this song about?

422
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,833
"On lord krishna and
His beloved radha."

423
01:05:51,202 --> 01:05:53,500
Who are they?

424
01:05:57,208 --> 01:06:02,111
In india, all lovers are seen
As lord krishna and radha.

425
01:06:03,481 --> 01:06:05,779
Do we get to join in this
celebration?

426
01:06:08,486 --> 01:06:14,288
It's not safe anywhere except
By the river bank of shivpuri.

427
01:06:18,529 --> 01:06:21,225
But I'll show you the
celebration from here.

428
01:06:38,249 --> 01:06:41,810
"Kisna the lord is all in one
And one in all"

429
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,889
"He's vibrant, a poet, a warrior..."

430
01:06:47,325 --> 01:06:51,489
"He's a lover, a musician..."

431
01:06:53,831 --> 01:06:57,426
"so clever and kind..."

432
01:06:59,871 --> 01:07:02,101
"A king... a commoner..."

433
01:07:02,473 --> 01:07:03,701
"A philosopher..."

434
01:07:04,142 --> 01:07:07,543
"He charms one and all..."

435
01:07:08,146 --> 01:07:11,638
"That's kisna for you..."

436
01:08:09,907 --> 01:08:12,102
"she's deeply in love..."

437
01:08:14,479 --> 01:08:16,777
"she's sleepless in love"

438
01:08:25,590 --> 01:08:27,558
"she's unaware of the world"

439
01:08:27,825 --> 01:08:29,793
"They say she's head over heels
In love"

440
01:08:30,228 --> 01:08:35,564
"On meeting kisna, she forgets
Every other bond in life..."

441
01:08:37,201 --> 01:08:42,138
"she just chants his name
All the time."

442
01:08:43,875 --> 01:08:47,572
"Lives every moment
Of her life for kisna..."

443
01:08:52,216 --> 01:08:55,151
"That's radha for you..."

444
01:09:47,171 --> 01:09:55,135
"she's beautiful in all ways...
By heart, face and mind"

445
01:10:00,551 --> 01:10:03,714
Her love for kisna is
Deeper than the ocean...

446
01:10:04,221 --> 01:10:10,490
"That's radha for you..."

447
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:43,840
"Bhairo's men have left
Haridwar and reached faizabad."

448
01:12:44,749 --> 01:12:47,183
"They're hunting for both
Of you there."

449
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:53,680
"Lets' catch the 7 a.m. Train
To delhi."

450
01:12:55,025 --> 01:12:56,856
You take the bus...

451
01:12:57,228 --> 01:12:58,855
We'll reach by horse cart.

452
01:12:59,230 --> 01:13:01,130
Just as I thought!

453
01:13:07,838 --> 01:13:09,135
Scared?

454
01:13:11,175 --> 01:13:12,802
Are you alright now?

455
01:13:14,712 --> 01:13:16,475
Leaving today...?

456
01:13:17,548 --> 01:13:20,142
Here is a sari and shawl
for you.

457
01:13:22,353 --> 01:13:25,322
What did you like most
In rishikesh?

458
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:27,714
The ganges...

459
01:13:28,192 --> 01:13:29,489
Kisna...

460
01:13:29,894 --> 01:13:31,919
And... you!

461
01:13:34,198 --> 01:13:35,665
Why me?

462
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:40,159
"Your love... Your sacrifice.
- What sacrifice?"

463
01:13:40,871 --> 01:13:45,706
Gave me your bedroom and clothes,
Made my stay so memorable.

464
01:13:46,210 --> 01:13:47,837
No big deal...!

465
01:13:48,279 --> 01:13:55,185
It is a big deal. We don't
Do so much...

466
01:13:56,220 --> 01:13:58,188
...That too for a stranger.

467
01:13:59,223 --> 01:14:01,623
"Well, that's india for you...!"

468
01:14:02,426 --> 01:14:07,295
That's why I love india so much
And am sad about leaving it.

469
01:14:07,865 --> 01:14:11,130
I know why you're leaving.
- How...?

470
01:14:13,170 --> 01:14:18,608
My husband nandu can't lie
And I knew it...

471
01:14:19,243 --> 01:14:22,474
That kisna and you aren't married.

472
01:14:24,281 --> 01:14:30,151
Kisna's ensuring that you
Reach home safely...

473
01:14:31,288 --> 01:14:35,156
I stayed quiet because
They're on the right path.

474
01:14:37,394 --> 01:14:38,827
Isn't it?

475
01:14:41,532 --> 01:14:45,400
I liked it that you love
Our hindu ways.

476
01:14:49,673 --> 01:14:51,641
But now I feel sad...

477
01:14:52,209 --> 01:14:56,669
feels like my own sister
Is leaving me.

478
01:15:06,423 --> 01:15:10,826
It's time to leave,
Not to cry.

479
01:15:26,844 --> 01:15:32,578
My life is no life without you...

480
01:15:34,585 --> 01:15:40,148
My life is no life without you...

481
01:16:46,190 --> 01:16:48,818
can I get two tickets for delhi?
- Yes.
