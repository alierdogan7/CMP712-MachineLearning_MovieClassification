Don't tell me you're
having second thoughts again.

12
00:02:06,573 --> 00:02:09,770
Somewhat. -
- I think I'll go mad now.

13
00:02:10,477 --> 00:02:13,913
Graduation in Bengali, M.A. In History,
now what? Mountaineering?

14
00:02:15,282 --> 00:02:19,514
It's only because of you that I'm
here instead of my Dad's business.

15
00:02:19,686 --> 00:02:23,053
Stop flirting, Amit. Listen Maya,
if you want to do Music...

16
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,554
...I think you might as... -
- Miss Firebrand,

17
00:02:26,927 --> 00:02:29,452
Mr. Coward Lee...

18
00:02:29,796 --> 00:02:31,525
Not again!

19
00:02:31,998 --> 00:02:33,556
Let's go to the canteen.

20
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:43,064
M. Phil in Portuguese studies.
Gujarati by birth. Aspiring Bengali.

21
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,574
Name: Withheld for the time being.

22
00:02:45,645 --> 00:02:48,307
Why don't you complain? -
- Why? What's bugging you?

23
00:02:48,381 --> 00:02:50,474
Moreover I think he is quite cute.

24
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,980
Stop joking. Shut up. -
- Brother, three.

25
00:02:53,053 --> 00:02:56,386
If someone stalks me,
wont I get irritated?

26
00:02:56,623 --> 00:02:59,717
And I know these guys very well.
Mouli has told me...

27
00:02:59,793 --> 00:03:01,920
...typical Gujarati guy with a rich dad.

28
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:05,962
Weird! Follows me everywhere I go.

29
00:03:06,032 --> 00:03:09,024
Keeps sending messages
through people! Is this a college?

30
00:03:10,303 --> 00:03:13,761
Oh I see! You mean you
would've dated him in college?

31
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,272
This is university, so... -
- Not at all.

32
00:03:16,476 --> 00:03:18,501
Not even during
my pension years.

33
00:03:18,645 --> 00:03:21,045
Yes, true. The bugger's totally crazy.

34
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:24,444
He was supposed to pass
out four years ago but...

35
00:03:24,518 --> 00:03:27,578
...then he saw her and fell in love.

36
00:03:27,654 --> 00:03:30,623
Then he started with some
Portuguese or Spanish studies...

37
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,714
Excuse me.

38
00:03:36,963 --> 00:03:37,952
Yes.

39
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:41,763
I want to... err...

40
00:03:41,935 --> 00:03:44,028
...I needed to speak to you.

41
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:48,668
Only you. Only you shall I tell.

42
00:03:49,743 --> 00:03:50,937
Shut up.

43
00:03:51,478 --> 00:03:52,570
Tell me.

44
00:03:52,846 --> 00:03:53,904
Err...

45
00:03:54,514 --> 00:03:57,642
Not here, if you could come out...

46
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:02,785
English would be better. I don't
prefer Hindi and you can't speak Bengali.

47
00:04:02,856 --> 00:04:04,483
Sit, I'll be back.

48
00:04:06,726 --> 00:04:08,489
Yellow pants.

49
00:04:08,929 --> 00:04:10,021
Correct decision.

50
00:04:10,697 --> 00:04:13,894
I really don't have time.
And I hate walking.

51
00:04:15,936 --> 00:04:19,064
The thing is... sorry...

52
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,508
...what I wanted to say is...

53
00:04:23,643 --> 00:04:25,577
I mean to say...

54
00:04:26,646 --> 00:04:27,613
...the things is that... -

55
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:29,581
- The thing is that
you're wasting your time.

56
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:32,550
Because you're interested in
someone about whom you know nothing.

57
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:35,486
You don't know her, don't
know her likes and dislikes,

58
00:04:35,555 --> 00:04:38,046
...you can't even
pronounce her name properly.

59
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,781
Just a second, Madam.

60
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:44,861
You're not letting me speak.
I am a complete Bengali.

61
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:47,698
I was born in Kolkata.

62
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:50,460
My father's a chartered accountant.

63
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:53,938
You're Bengali is
flawed and desperate.

64
00:04:54,507 --> 00:04:57,635
This existential crisis is very
insulting for my mother tongue.

65
00:04:57,711 --> 00:05:00,737
And the city is called Kolkata,
not 'Kolkata'.

66
00:05:00,814 --> 00:05:02,975
Thirdly, I really don't
care if your dad's a...

67
00:05:03,049 --> 00:05:05,745
...chartered
accountant or a businessman.

68
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:07,582
We don't have any similarities.

69
00:05:07,654 --> 00:05:09,588
Love is a far cry.
Friendship too won't work.

70
00:05:09,656 --> 00:05:14,025
You have Dhoklas for breakfast
and our plates are aquariums, so...

71
00:05:14,527 --> 00:05:16,825
I like fish too.

72
00:05:16,896 --> 00:05:19,296
In fact Hilsa is my... -

73
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:22,927
- Eating Hilsa fish makes
you a Bengali?

74
00:05:23,003 --> 00:05:27,440
I read Bengali poetry and
stories too. I read Tagore.

75
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:29,868
Satyajit Ray? -
- Think you can land...

76
00:05:29,943 --> 00:05:32,571
...a Bengali girl reading
Tagore's translated work, Mr. Lee?

77
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:34,544
I suggest you get lost.

78
00:05:34,614 --> 00:05:37,014
In translation. -
- Mr. Lee? But I'm Rohit.

79
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:41,076
Good. Stay whatever you are
and let me remain the way I am.

80
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:43,312
I know Bengali songs too.

81
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:46,354
Maybe it's only for you

82
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:49,985
That I am wildly in love

83
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,626
I know you're unique-

84
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:57,770
- Wow! You have a very nice voice!

85
00:05:59,506 --> 00:06:00,632
Okay, here's the deal.

86
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:06,270
First compose a Bengali song about me...

87
00:06:06,346 --> 00:06:09,509
...and then sing it with
proper Bengali pronunciation.

88
00:06:10,316 --> 00:06:13,649
And then, I'll think
about your proposition. Okay?

Good morning.

136
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:09,080
Welcome to the final semester...

137
00:11:09,315 --> 00:11:11,442
...of our
international exchange program.

138
00:11:11,784 --> 00:11:15,982
I'm Professor Salazar, your
chief counsellor for this session.

139
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,653
A session on the historical
segments of Portuguese studies.

140
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:24,094
During the semester we'll
have a total of sixteen credits.

141
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,060
And you shall be graded

00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,994

a choice of the following:

143
00:11:30,536 --> 00:11:31,867
Colonial Politics.

144
00:11:31,938 --> 00:11:33,701
Fine Arts.
Music.

145
00:11:33,973 --> 00:11:35,338
Or Architecture.

146
00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:37,808
And for each of the broad subjects,

147
00:11:37,877 --> 00:11:40,846
there's going to be an
expert supervisor...

148
00:11:41,414 --> 00:11:43,712
...who will help you
with your chosen subject,

149
00:11:44,017 --> 00:11:45,951
in terms of the bibliography,

150
00:11:46,452 --> 00:11:49,387
videographic  and

151
00:11:49,956 --> 00:11:51,981

152
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:57,090

153

and I want to wish you the
very best for this semester...

154

...and for the rest of your career.

155
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:03,425
Thank you very much.

156
00:12:24,424 --> 00:12:27,587
Med school student.

157
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,391
Only Bengali guy in the

158
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:34,965
Hello Mr. Disco Dandia.

159
00:12:38,104 --> 00:12:40,902
Again that grumpy face.
What's wrong with you?

160
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:43,742
How many times do I have to tell you?

161
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:45,673
Only speak in Bengali with me.

162
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:49,011
I need practice. -
- Mission Maya?

163
00:12:50,783 --> 00:12:53,445
How long shall this madness continue?

164
00:12:53,686 --> 00:12:55,779
See I understand
people fall in love.

165
00:12:55,855 --> 00:12:57,482
Things don't work out.
They move on.

166
00:12:57,657 --> 00:12:59,989
No one laments like
you for three years.

167
00:13:01,294 --> 00:13:03,285
I'm lamenting? -
- Aren't you?

168
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:05,588
When you don't have studies,
you either sit here...

169
00:13:05,665 --> 00:13:08,259
...or in the music
class, lost in your thoughts for hours.

170
00:13:09,268 --> 00:13:10,701
Just being optimistic.

171
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:13,601
Somewhere, someday...

172
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,838
...a miracle may happen. -
- Now this is too much!

173
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,068
Sitting here like a
'Lathkhor' (loser)... -

174
00:13:19,312 --> 00:13:20,074
- What?

175
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,913
What's this 'Lathkhor'?

176
00:13:21,981 --> 00:13:24,575
Lathkhor. Lath? Kick?
You know, a kick?

177
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,912
A kick?

178
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:28,011
And 'khor' means the one who...

179
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:31,446
Will you stop this? -
- Okay.

180
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:35,893
Okay let's assume I suddenly
bump into her somewhere one day.

181
00:13:36,496 --> 00:13:38,464
If I don't know Bengali...

182
00:13:38,898 --> 00:13:41,059
...sorry for the pronunciation.

183
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:45,531
How am I supposed to speak
to her then? And about what?

184
00:13:46,038 --> 00:13:48,871
If I don't learn music,
don't know Bengali culture, -

185
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,009
- Listen bro, it doesn't work like that.

186
00:13:51,544 --> 00:13:54,035
And you seriously think
this is an issue nowadays?

187
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:57,541
Bengali-Gujarati, Bengali-Punjabi,
Bengali-Marwari...

188
00:13:57,617 --> 00:13:59,448
...it's happening all the time now.

189
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:01,985
I have a distant cousin who
married a man from Greenland.

190
00:14:02,288 --> 00:14:04,779
Eskimo blood running in his veins. Fine.

191
00:14:04,924 --> 00:14:07,518
Don't look that far.
Look at me and Gabriela.

192
00:14:08,327 --> 00:14:08,918
Listen,

193
00:14:09,695 --> 00:14:11,890
Maya is not
interested in you as a person.

194
00:14:11,964 --> 00:14:14,762
She just used that
'culture' crap to avoid you.

195
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:17,330
You don't know her, Bodhi.

196
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:19,466
She's Bengali with a vengeance.

197
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:21,006
Immersed in Bengali culture.

198
00:14:21,073 --> 00:14:22,904
All the time she is with...

199
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:24,431
...Bengali songs...

200
00:14:25,411 --> 00:14:26,742
...Bengali poetry...

201
00:14:27,046 --> 00:14:28,673
...Bengali dance.

202
00:14:28,881 --> 00:14:31,907
She feels, Bengali is intellectually...

203
00:14:32,285 --> 00:14:34,014
...the most superior race.

204
00:14:34,854 --> 00:14:37,618
Sorry for my flawed Bengali.

205
00:14:40,693 --> 00:14:42,684
In fact, can you imagine...

206
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,463
...if not necessary...

207
00:14:45,932 --> 00:14:48,025
...she does not use one
English word...

208
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:50,466
...in a Bengali sentence.

209
00:14:50,536 --> 00:14:53,061
Hello friends, we're
back from a break. I'm Maya.

210
00:14:53,306 --> 00:14:57,709
You're listening to 'World of
Music' on 98.3 Radio Mirchi.

211
00:14:57,944 --> 00:15:00,606
You just heard 'Bhindeshi
Tara' by Chandrabindoo...

212
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,012
...and Sudhin
Dasgupta's 'Kathay Kathay'...

213
00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:05,240
...in Manna Dey's voice.

214
00:15:05,384 --> 00:15:07,852
Our last song today, Salil
Choudhury's composition,

215
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,720
...lyrics by Sukanto,
sung by Hemant Kumar... -

216
00:15:11,924 --> 00:15:13,516
- Boss is calling you.

217
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:15,451
...'Abak Prithibi'.

218
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:16,953
Enjoy!

219
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,024
Please,

220
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:21,762
concentrate on your studies
instead of thinking of Maya.

221
00:15:22,034 --> 00:15:24,264
Don't forget this is
your dissertation year.

222
00:15:24,604 --> 00:15:25,969
Thought of a topic?

223
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:27,735
No.

224
00:15:29,508 --> 00:15:32,944
Think I'll go to the library
after the music class tomorrow.

225
00:15:34,413 --> 00:15:35,471
Let's see...

226
00:15:36,882 --> 00:15:37,974
...I'll figure out something.

227
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,412
It has to do with music.

228
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,454
And knowing you,
Bengali music.

229
00:15:44,957 --> 00:15:46,083
Adios Amigo.

230
00:16:47,086 --> 00:16:50,317
Born in the suburbs, now
resides in upmarket Kolkata.

231
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:54,291
Bengali roots; forgotten. Speaks English
with pride. Bikram Botobyal aka Vicky.

232
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,658
The reports are out,
not happening man.

233
00:16:56,796 --> 00:16:57,728
Just not happening.

234
00:16:57,797 --> 00:17:00,960
What is not happening and from
which angle do I appear to be a man?

235
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:02,527
Cut it out, Maya.

236
00:17:02,668 --> 00:17:04,636
You're articulate, you've
a nice texture,

237
00:17:04,704 --> 00:17:08,435
so I offered you Coffee house
Classics at prime time, you refused.

238
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:10,907
You said you want to play
Bengali songs. I said, fine.

239
00:17:10,976 --> 00:17:13,911
I said change your name,
you threw tantrums there too.

240
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:17,608
Of course! What was the
problem with the name, 'Mahamaya'?

241
00:17:17,683 --> 00:17:18,513
As in?

242
00:17:18,718 --> 00:17:20,242
RJ Mahamaya?

243
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,514
Are you kidding me?
It sounds so... so... -

244
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:24,715
- Bengali, and you have
a problem with that?

245
00:17:24,857 --> 00:17:29,317
Maya, now don't start all over
again with your Language Movement.

246
00:17:29,395 --> 00:17:31,329
The ratings are dropping man.

247
00:17:31,397 --> 00:17:34,423
See, I am cool with remixed
Rabindrasangeet and Bangla Band.

248
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,469
We can have a separate slot
for that because they sell.

249
00:17:37,536 --> 00:17:41,632
But these drab songs
that you play from 50s... -

250
00:17:41,707 --> 00:17:43,607
- Not selling, isn't it?

251
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:47,034
You're mixing up the TG.
Ratings are dropping.

252
00:17:47,947 --> 00:17:50,848
Listen Mr. Vicky aka Bikram,
my target group is...

253
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,908
...the population that likes
listening to all kinds of Bengali songs.

254
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:57,080
They may be few in number but
they're increasing and realizing...

255
00:17:57,323 --> 00:18:00,053
...that there is Bengali music
beyond Rabindrasangeet and bands.

256
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:02,852
Yes but... -
- No, there can be no 'but', Sir.

257
00:18:02,928 --> 00:18:05,897
Along with Rabindrasangeet
and band music I play...

258
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:07,728
...Sudhin Dasgupta and
Salil Choudhury too.

259
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,735
In order to love Bengali
music one must listen to...

260
00:18:10,803 --> 00:18:13,237
...Mohiner Ghoraguli
and Ramprasad likewise.

261
00:18:13,305 --> 00:18:15,796
Because both Nachiketa Chakrabarty and
Nachiekta Ghosh have written about me.

262
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,036
Because both
Anjan Dutta and Mukul Dutta...

263
00:18:18,277 --> 00:18:19,505
...have written their
songs in my language.

264
00:18:19,578 --> 00:18:24,572
Because Apupam Roy, Anupam Ghatak,
Rupam Islam, Nazrul Islam, all are mine.

265
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:25,748
Bye.

266
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:02,812
How have you been!

267
00:20:03,682 --> 00:20:06,583
How have you been?
You've shaved!

268
00:20:06,986 --> 00:20:09,079
And how're you?

269
00:20:09,321 --> 00:20:12,518
Had to do away with the
intellectual stubble for my job.

270
00:20:12,758 --> 00:20:14,851
Okay... this one's yours.

271
00:20:14,927 --> 00:20:15,655
Give me.

272
00:20:15,728 --> 00:20:16,524
And...

273
00:20:17,296 --> 00:20:18,729
...wait a second...

274
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:23,491
...this too is yours. -
- Oh my God!

275
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:24,866
This is yours. -
- Thank you!

276
00:20:24,937 --> 00:20:27,929
And check this out. -
- Saradindu? For her?

277
00:20:29,675 --> 00:20:31,336
Inform your dentist
before you read that Bengali.

278
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:35,642
So tell me, how do you find
your city after so many years?

279
00:20:35,714 --> 00:20:38,581
Let's see... the roads are less dug up.

280
00:20:39,885 --> 00:20:42,979
The water's turned mineral,
the air's less polluted...

281
00:20:43,055 --> 00:20:46,582
...and among fruits,
mangoes have become costlier.

282
00:20:47,927 --> 00:20:51,090
And what else? What did
you do in the last two years?

283
00:20:51,363 --> 00:20:55,322
I found a job after
the university...

284
00:21:11,784 --> 00:21:13,843
What about you? -
- Well... umm...

285
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,286
...my story too has
been quite... you know...

286
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:41,609
Great. Writing the screenplays
of your lives together, are you?

287
00:21:45,951 --> 00:21:48,920
Tell her! -
- See, the situation is a bit like...

288
00:21:51,724 --> 00:21:53,055
...we're seeing each other.

289
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,615
'A bit' as in?

290
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:59,754
In grams or metric tonne? Though
I haven't been informed, so... -

291
00:22:00,366 --> 00:22:01,924
Maya... -
- Maya.

292
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:10,740
She is not pissed off.

293
00:22:11,543 --> 00:22:13,602
That's brilliant!

294
00:22:14,313 --> 00:22:17,612
Congratulations! Something
worthwhile finally, both of you.

295
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,546
And as they say, you
may now kiss the bride.

296
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:21,449
Okay!

297
00:22:22,888 --> 00:22:23,980
Stop it.

298
00:22:24,423 --> 00:22:26,050
What? -
- Anyway, what about you?

299
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,885
What about me? Life
goes on. Radio station.

300
00:22:28,961 --> 00:22:31,794
Chatting people up, playing
their requests, that's it.

301
00:22:31,864 --> 00:22:32,796
Still single?

302
00:22:35,701 --> 00:22:38,864
Sadly. Because you changed. -
- Cut the crap.

303
00:22:38,937 --> 00:22:41,531
What about that cute guy,
is he still pursuing you?

304
00:22:41,607 --> 00:22:42,904
Right, what was his name?

305
00:22:42,975 --> 00:22:44,067
That guy...

306
00:22:44,777 --> 00:22:47,337
Mr. Coward Lee. Did he
finally gather the courage?

307
00:22:47,646 --> 00:22:51,810
No. He had managed to get my
email id and sent me a mail.

308
00:22:51,884 --> 00:22:54,352
Doing something somewhere. -
- What did he write?

309
00:22:54,787 --> 00:22:57,119
Is the knight with a shining guitar...

310
00:22:57,356 --> 00:22:59,119
...returning with
Bengali alphabets?

311
00:23:05,297 --> 00:23:08,494
Sir, I need to go back to India. -
- An unscheduled vacation?

312
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:10,967
Err... no Sir, a research assignment.

313
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:13,434
Hello. -
- Hello.

314
00:23:18,377 --> 00:23:19,935
Namaskar, Sir.

315
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:23,505
Please come. Please take your seat.

316
00:23:29,388 --> 00:23:33,654
He looks exactly like
Heynsman Sahib. Isn't it?

317
00:23:33,726 --> 00:23:37,321
Gourhari? -
- Yes, you're right.

318
00:23:37,496 --> 00:23:40,795
So what's your name, sahib? -
- Antony. Heynsman Antony.

319
00:23:40,866 --> 00:23:43,460
He was born in a very wealthy
Portuguese family, Sir.

320
00:23:43,602 --> 00:23:46,002
He came down to India in
the early nineteenth century.

321
00:23:46,371 --> 00:23:48,339
Landed at Chandannagore, West Bengal.

322
00:23:48,507 --> 00:23:50,532
Earlier it was known
as Phawrashdanga.

323
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:54,406
Though he was a businessman's son,
his main interest was music.

324
00:23:54,546 --> 00:23:57,777
And he then went on to become
one of the main proponents...

325
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,511
...of the 'Kabigaan'
tradition of Bengal.

326
00:23:59,585 --> 00:24:02,713
Kabigaan? -
- Yes... sort of...

327
00:24:03,355 --> 00:24:05,915
...sort of troubadours
or minstrels, Sir.

328
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,653
They would get into
musical battles through songs...

329
00:24:08,727 --> 00:24:11,457
...and the songs were mainly
about the Hindu gods and goddesses.

330
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,930
Hold on, let me get
this straight.

331
00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:15,967
This is your dissertation topic?

332
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:17,997
Yes, Sir.

333
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,595
I feel that's a very
interesting topic but...

334
00:24:20,672 --> 00:24:22,572
...couldn't you find something
else that has a little more...

335
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:24,040
...information available?

336
00:24:24,276 --> 00:24:26,301
Which is exactly why
I need to go, Sir.

337
00:24:26,411 --> 00:24:28,743
There is very little
information on the internet,

338
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:32,380
apart from a mention of a
fictionalized Bengali film.

339
00:24:32,851 --> 00:24:36,309
Actually, Sir, I feel
very strongly about this.

340
00:24:38,323 --> 00:24:39,915
I'm a Bengali, you know.

341
00:24:40,826 --> 00:24:42,316
And a musician too.

342
00:24:42,861 --> 00:24:46,854
I find it very inspiring that
one can actually learn a language,

343
00:24:46,932 --> 00:24:49,867
overcome all odds and then
go onto write a song.

344
00:24:49,935 --> 00:24:51,698
Okay, let's see.

345
00:24:51,904 --> 00:24:55,965
A Portuguese musician makes
it big in colonised Bengal.

346
00:24:57,609 --> 00:25:00,703
Go for it, son. I'll speak
to Maurinho on your behalf.

347
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:04,340
How about some music
today, Sahib?

348
00:25:04,783 --> 00:25:07,251
Want to listen?
What do I sing?

349
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:09,414
A song, of course.

350
00:25:09,555 --> 00:25:12,251
Not tax accounts obviously.

351
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:16,859
Heard you're into music?

352
00:25:16,929 --> 00:25:19,955
Are you carrying an
instrument in that bag?

353
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,858
Want to see?

354
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,631
Wow!

355
00:27:10,342 --> 00:27:12,537
Going only for the dissertation, right?

356
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,013
Took music lessons all these days,

357
00:27:20,886 --> 00:27:22,410
learnt Bengali from you,

358
00:27:23,689 --> 00:27:24,951
won't I accept the challenge?

359
00:28:36,561 --> 00:28:39,928
Brilliant!
That was ecstatic!

360
00:28:41,533 --> 00:28:45,594
Brilliant!
Enchanting!

361
00:28:49,775 --> 00:28:51,640
Sahib, care for a drag?

362
00:29:53,872 --> 00:29:55,396
Mini...

363
00:29:58,677 --> 00:30:00,042
Mini...

364
00:30:05,684 --> 00:30:06,981
Mini...

365
00:30:12,591 --> 00:30:13,888
Mini...

366
00:30:19,498 --> 00:30:21,056
Mini!

367
00:30:23,335 --> 00:30:25,428
Mini...

368
00:30:29,641 --> 00:30:30,938
Mini...

369
00:30:35,647 --> 00:30:39,083
The cool widow. For
everything from a power cut to...

370
00:30:39,317 --> 00:30:42,309
...terrorism, recommends a cup
of tea as a solution. Name: Ma.

371
00:30:44,723 --> 00:30:46,588
What a surprise!

372
00:30:46,658 --> 00:30:48,888
You two have remained the same,
not changed a bit!

373
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,360
Really! -
- So your diet's not working.

374
00:30:51,496 --> 00:30:54,590
Come in. -
- Tofu has become her stable food!

375
00:30:55,467 --> 00:30:57,628
Auntie, long time since we
had your special egg curry.

376
00:30:57,702 --> 00:31:00,535
Why not today? -
- I got diagnozed with Uric Acid.

377
00:31:00,605 --> 00:31:01,594
Oh no.

378
00:31:02,641 --> 00:31:04,871
You're laughing? -
- And what's with you?

379
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,935
Your boss has driven me
crazy with his phone calls.

380
00:31:08,013 --> 00:31:09,708
Why do you leave your phone behind?

381
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:12,846
I think I'm fired. -
- Huh?

382
00:31:13,552 --> 00:31:15,486
What!
Anyway,

383
00:31:15,754 --> 00:31:16,846
tea? -
- Yes.

384
00:31:16,922 --> 00:31:20,483
Ma! I just lost my job
and your offering them tea?

385
00:31:21,993 --> 00:31:22,891
Look at her!

386
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:25,327
We'll miss the tea
because you got fired?

387
00:31:27,866 --> 00:31:30,300
You called? -
- Thirteen times.

388
00:31:30,368 --> 00:31:32,734
What is the use of carrying a
mobile phone if you can't...

389
00:31:32,804 --> 00:31:35,500
...carry it along wherever you... -
- Am I fired?

390
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,971
What! Why?

391
00:31:37,042 --> 00:31:41,308
After that day's speech and
today's missed calls, that's natural.

392
00:31:41,413 --> 00:31:42,971
Rubbish, Maya.
Listen.

393
00:31:43,548 --> 00:31:46,108
I've had a phone call from
a very important person.

394
00:31:46,351 --> 00:31:47,875
Someone in the ministry. They want to...

395
00:31:48,086 --> 00:31:49,678
...they want us to organize a concert.

396
00:31:49,754 --> 00:31:52,416
So, it's kind of huge,
can you come down?

397
00:31:52,691 --> 00:31:54,386
Right now? Impossible!

398
00:31:54,459 --> 00:31:55,687
Tomorrow, at the station?

399
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,590
Okay.

400
00:31:56,795 --> 00:31:58,558
Tomorrow morning, at six. -
- What!

401
00:33:11,836 --> 00:33:12,598
Hello.

402
00:33:13,004 --> 00:33:13,902
Hello.

403
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:17,303
Hello.

404
00:33:17,642 --> 00:33:18,870
This is Rohit Mehta.

405
00:33:19,477 --> 00:33:22,571
And this is the first
documentation under coursework numbered...

406
00:33:22,647 --> 00:33:24,740
...536, under the title...

407
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:27,517
...'The Life and
Times of Henysman Antony'.

408
00:33:28,486 --> 00:33:30,010
We're at Chandannagore now...

409
00:33:30,555 --> 00:33:32,614
...looking for our
first lead.

410
00:33:33,058 --> 00:33:37,392
Heynsman Antony, who was
known as Antony Phiringi here.

411
00:33:38,096 --> 00:33:41,088
Before we gather any
written information...

412
00:33:41,466 --> 00:33:44,765
...let's see, what is the
general awareness and perception...

413
00:33:44,936 --> 00:33:47,905
...about Antony
amongst the normal public.

414
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:52,403
Has anyone heard of him?
Do people know him? Etc.

415
00:33:52,877 --> 00:33:54,469
Let's start with the market.

416
00:33:54,546 --> 00:33:56,980
Antony, the foreigner? -
- I don't quite... -

417
00:33:57,048 --> 00:33:58,606
Must be a Frenchman.

418
00:33:58,683 --> 00:33:59,513
Marcus Anthony?

419
00:33:59,584 --> 00:34:01,677
My name is Anthony Gonsalves.

420
00:34:01,753 --> 00:34:06,019
I want to spend my whole life

421
00:34:06,257 --> 00:34:07,781
Antony? -
- Yes.

422
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:09,449
What? A school?

423
00:34:09,527 --> 00:34:12,325
I am the night and you're my moon-

424
00:34:12,397 --> 00:34:14,058
- Uttam Kumar played
the role in Bengali...

425
00:34:14,299 --> 00:34:16,426
...and Amitabh Bachhan in Hindi.

426
00:34:16,501 --> 00:34:18,799
No. -
- You mean Uttam Kumar?

427
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:19,928
Shakespeare.

428
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:22,637
"Friends, Romans, countrymen;

429
00:34:22,707 --> 00:34:25,369
lend me your ears, I have
come to bury Caeser.

430
00:34:25,643 --> 00:34:26,541
Not to praise him."

431
00:34:26,611 --> 00:34:28,511
ATV star? -
- No idea.

432
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,640
The Zamindar families here?
Ask there. You'll find him.

433
00:34:31,716 --> 00:34:32,910
A Bengali film.

434
00:34:32,984 --> 00:34:37,444
We're ordinary people. All we're
concerned about is our daily bread.

435
00:34:37,522 --> 00:34:39,456
Open the gill. -
- What's the address they've given?

436
00:34:39,524 --> 00:34:43,460
Chandannagore is a huge area. -
- I've acted in plays in college.

437
00:34:43,528 --> 00:34:46,793
Kundu Villa is nearby, go there. -
- Antony and Cleopatra.

438
00:34:47,298 --> 00:34:49,323
I played Cleopatra.

439
00:34:49,401 --> 00:34:51,961
I get all that
but who is Antony?

440
00:34:54,305 --> 00:34:55,431
Excuse me. -
- Yes.

441
00:34:55,507 --> 00:34:57,099
Which way is the
Central Library?

442
00:34:57,675 --> 00:35:00,007
Go straight,
take a right and then left.

443
00:35:27,572 --> 00:35:28,402
Yes?

444
00:35:29,007 --> 00:35:33,467
Needed some books on 19th
century Bengali culture.

445
00:35:33,545 --> 00:35:35,809
Name of the book?
Who is the author?

446
00:35:36,448 --> 00:35:40,509
I have it on my mobile.
Just a second.

447
00:35:40,585 --> 00:35:43,315
Yes, Ishwarchandra Gupta's...

448
00:35:43,388 --> 00:35:45,788
'A Poet's
Biography', Prafulla Chandra Pal's...

449
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:48,388
'Ancient Poet's Song',

450
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:52,926
Niranjan Chakrabarty's
'19th Century Scriptures...

451
00:35:52,997 --> 00:35:55,591
...and Bengali Literature'.

452
00:35:55,834 --> 00:35:57,495
And Madan Bandopadhyay's...

453
00:35:57,569 --> 00:35:59,594
'Singer-song-writer,
Antony, the Foreigner'.

454
00:36:00,104 --> 00:36:02,504
Kushal, see what he wants.

455
00:36:09,547 --> 00:36:12,914
Assistant librarian by profession.
Voracious appetite for books.

456
00:36:12,984 --> 00:36:18,752
Name: Kushal Hajra.

457
00:36:31,269 --> 00:36:33,601
Hello. These books...

458
00:36:34,305 --> 00:36:36,899
...Ishwarchandra Gupta's... -
- Not available.

459
00:36:37,976 --> 00:36:38,772
Huh?

460
00:36:38,843 --> 00:36:40,970
The four books you want,
we don't have them.

461
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,380
We've the fourth edition
of Asith Bandopadhyay's...

462
00:36:44,449 --> 00:36:46,815
'History of Bengali Literature'.
I can give it to you.

463
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:50,918
But if you want to know about
Antony the singer-song writer,

464
00:36:50,989 --> 00:36:52,957
you won't get more than two pages in it.

465
00:36:53,024 --> 00:36:55,288
Umm... I mean... err...

466
00:36:55,727 --> 00:36:59,288
...can you tell me where
can I find these books?

467
00:37:00,632 --> 00:37:05,592
Not in Chandannagore. Try
College Street in Kolkata.

468
00:37:06,638 --> 00:37:08,970
But people usually don't
keep these books anymore.

469
00:37:09,807 --> 00:37:13,743
You could take a chance at the
Bengali Literature Association.

470
00:37:15,246 --> 00:37:16,270
Okay.

471
00:37:16,781 --> 00:37:17,748
Thank you.

472
00:37:19,384 --> 00:37:20,510
But you won't find.

473
00:37:25,657 --> 00:37:26,521
But...

474
00:37:26,991 --> 00:37:29,789
...you just said... -
- You'll find the books.

475
00:37:31,262 --> 00:37:32,593
Not Antony.

476
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:36,699
And definitely not his times.

477
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:41,800
So where can I find
Antony and his times?

478
00:37:43,775 --> 00:37:45,709
Do you have the
time for that?

479
00:37:47,779 --> 00:37:48,939
And the patience?

480
00:37:51,482 --> 00:37:52,449
Try me.

481
00:37:56,387 --> 00:37:57,046
Fine.

482
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:02,348
Wait behind the Sacred
Heart Church at 8pm tonight.

483
00:38:04,796 --> 00:38:05,728
I will...

484
00:38:07,799 --> 00:38:09,494
...take you to Antony.

485
00:38:11,336 --> 00:38:15,033
The government is about to get
into a pact with Bangladesh.

486
00:38:15,273 --> 00:38:18,265
Before that they want to
organize some sort of a...

487
00:38:18,343 --> 00:38:20,971
...a Fraternity concert
and all that, you know.

488
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:24,871
As in involving student
communities of both the Bengals.

489
00:38:24,949 --> 00:38:27,679
Some kind of a, you know... rock fest...

490
00:38:27,752 --> 00:38:31,244
...or a rock band competition
or something like that, so...

491
00:38:31,456 --> 00:38:33,754
...they want us to
be the radio partners...

492
00:38:33,825 --> 00:38:36,851
...and organize this
side of the entire thing.

493
00:38:37,462 --> 00:38:40,795
So we'll have to decide what... -
- Yes, but why Bangla bands only?

494
00:38:40,965 --> 00:38:43,957
Is Bangla band the only
way to unite the Bengals?

495
00:38:44,035 --> 00:38:46,003
Rabindrasangeet, Atul Prasad,
Nazrulgeeti... -

496
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:48,061
- Maya! Hold on.

497
00:38:48,406 --> 00:38:50,499
Hold on for a second.
Hold on to your crusade.

498
00:38:50,575 --> 00:38:52,372
This is not your radio show, okay?

499
00:38:52,443 --> 00:38:54,604
This is a format decided by authorities.

500
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:56,544
So they must have thought that it...

501
00:38:56,614 --> 00:38:59,378
...has a youth connect or
something like that. Whatever,

502
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:01,418
...that is not the point.
Point is this coming...

503
00:39:01,486 --> 00:39:03,647
...21st February, on World
Mother Tongue day, will you... -

504
00:39:03,721 --> 00:39:06,588
- At least call this day by
it's Bengali name?

505
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:09,282
Okay! Whatever!

506
00:39:09,594 --> 00:39:11,562
Will you help me put up
the show?

507
00:39:11,863 --> 00:39:16,766
Is the question mark just a
formality or do I have the option to refuse?

508
00:39:16,934 --> 00:39:20,028
Christ! Maya,
Bengali songs are your strength!

509
00:39:20,571 --> 00:39:22,402
So this huge process, you know...

510
00:39:22,473 --> 00:39:25,374
...the screenings, the
student auditions...

511
00:39:25,443 --> 00:39:28,970
...program scheduling,
deciding on the judges... Maya!

512
00:39:29,047 --> 00:39:31,845
You know all the music
personalities in town!

513
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:36,809
It can't happen without you, Maya,
I mean it'll be a mess.

514
00:39:36,888 --> 00:39:38,856
It'll be a pandemonium! -
- No, a bandemonium.

515
00:39:38,923 --> 00:39:39,821
Huh?

516
00:39:40,258 --> 00:39:44,695
I'll be there. And the concert
will be called Bandemonium, 2014.

517
00:39:44,996 --> 00:39:45,963
Hello.

518
00:39:46,564 --> 00:39:49,931
Now we're going for the second
documentation of the coursework.

519
00:39:50,001 --> 00:39:53,459
An interview... with the very
mysterious Mr. Kushal Hajra,

520
00:39:53,538 --> 00:39:56,632
...who is about to
introduce us to Mr. Antony.

521
00:39:56,908 --> 00:40:00,071
Henysman Antony, a guy
who according to the history books,

522
00:40:00,311 --> 00:40:02,871
...is dead for one seventy-seven years.

523
00:40:03,481 --> 00:40:07,611
Needless to say I feel Mr.
Kushal is a fraud.

524
00:40:07,919 --> 00:40:11,355
In fact, worse still, he
may have other intentions.

525
00:40:11,956 --> 00:40:13,924
But there was something about his voice,

526
00:40:14,859 --> 00:40:16,690
so I came.

527
00:40:17,462 --> 00:40:21,728
And who knows, I might find
a crucial lead about Antony.

528
00:40:22,033 --> 00:40:22,931
Let's see.

529
00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:19,043
So...

530
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:22,419
...you had told me that...

531
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:25,653
...I'll get to meet Antony? -
- All in good time.

532
00:42:27,925 --> 00:42:28,857
Sit.

533
00:42:31,028 --> 00:42:33,758
And tell me what you know about Antony?

534
00:42:37,501 --> 00:42:38,490
Not much.

535
00:42:39,003 --> 00:42:40,903
In the late 18th century,

536
00:42:41,405 --> 00:42:42,531
he was born in... -

537
00:42:42,607 --> 00:42:44,370
- What a shame!

538
00:42:45,443 --> 00:42:48,844
'Late 18th century'
after reading so many books?

539
00:42:49,647 --> 00:42:51,672
Don't even know his birth year?

540
00:42:52,984 --> 00:42:54,542
Yes, I mean...

541
00:42:55,686 --> 00:42:57,313
...err...

542
00:43:03,661 --> 00:43:05,959
You won't find Antony in pages of books,

543
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:09,625
Google.com or black and
white Bengali films, Rohit.

544
00:43:13,437 --> 00:43:14,904
You'll find printed letters...

545
00:43:16,073 --> 00:43:19,873
...some dates, bits
and pieces of lyrics.

546
00:43:20,611 --> 00:43:24,012
You'll find Uttam Kumar, the film star,
and Manna Dey's voice and...

547
00:43:24,782 --> 00:43:27,774
...you'll find the year
he died in, 1836.

548
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,487
But where's Antony?

549
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:33,381
Where is he?

550
00:43:34,592 --> 00:43:35,422
Where?

551
00:43:36,327 --> 00:43:37,316
Here.

552
00:43:37,862 --> 00:43:39,329
At Pharashdanga.

553
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:43,732
1786, the year Lord
Cornwaliis came to Calcutta,

554
00:43:44,368 --> 00:43:47,769
...Antony was born to a
salt merchant, Henysman.

555
00:43:48,072 --> 00:43:50,870
But the internet says...

556
00:43:51,475 --> 00:43:53,807
...he was born in Portugal.

557
00:43:54,478 --> 00:43:57,345
He did come to India... -
- Are you a Marwari?

558
00:43:58,616 --> 00:43:59,480
Huh?

559
00:43:59,951 --> 00:44:03,284
Marwari, Punjabi, Marathi,
Gujarati or...

560
00:44:03,788 --> 00:44:05,483
...a non-residential Bengali?

561
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:08,785
I am a Gujarati.

562
00:44:09,627 --> 00:44:11,322
But born and brought up in Kolkata.

563
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:13,421
So was Antony.

564
00:44:15,866 --> 00:44:17,527
Portuguese Christian.

565
00:44:20,004 --> 00:44:21,767
Born and brought up in...

566
00:44:22,573 --> 00:44:23,597
...Bengal.

567
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:29,902
If you ever make it big, if you
touch people's lives, you might find...

568
00:44:29,981 --> 00:44:34,884
...erroneous information about
you on the internet, after 150 years!

569
00:44:36,687 --> 00:44:37,779
But...

570
00:44:38,422 --> 00:44:39,889
...what about Antony... -

571
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:42,856
No time, isn't it?

572
00:44:43,661 --> 00:44:44,787
In a hurry?

573
00:44:44,929 --> 00:44:46,328
Not that.

574
00:44:46,998 --> 00:44:49,626
Go on.
Please speak.

575
00:44:49,967 --> 00:44:51,935
I will have
to speak.

576
00:44:53,037 --> 00:44:54,800
Or, gradually, I will...

577
00:44:57,108 --> 00:45:00,043
A lean Antony came to
the world with a mole...

578
00:45:01,312 --> 00:45:05,681
...on his right leg and
his father's huge business.

579
00:45:07,852 --> 00:45:11,754
From childhood itself he did not
get along with his brother, Kelly.

580
00:45:13,724 --> 00:45:15,885
Outside his bedroom
there was a...

581
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,662
...Banyan tree.

582
00:45:20,464 --> 00:45:22,694
That was Antony's only friend.

583
00:45:24,869 --> 00:45:27,599
When water dripped from it's
branches in the monsoons...

584
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:31,633
...Antony could see his mother...

585
00:45:34,078 --> 00:45:36,945
...water dripping from her hair...

586
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:43,452
...Antony's mother passed away
while giving birth to him.

587
00:45:44,822 --> 00:45:47,484
But how do you know
these things?

588
00:45:47,925 --> 00:45:50,393
You don't find
these in a history book.

589
00:45:51,395 --> 00:45:52,293
I know.

590
00:45:55,099 --> 00:45:56,532
Because I have seen.

591
00:45:59,336 --> 00:46:00,360
I see it everyday.

592
00:46:02,573 --> 00:46:03,972
Because I was there.

593
00:46:07,745 --> 00:46:09,235
Because I am Antony.

594
00:46:11,749 --> 00:46:13,444
Antony 'Phiringi' (foreigner).

595
00:46:24,361 --> 00:46:30,129
150 years back, had
looked for you, wanted to meet

596
00:46:30,301 --> 00:46:36,262
Tired and weary, had slept off
in the darkness of the street

597
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:41,277
And now you come looking for me

598
00:46:42,046 --> 00:46:48,281
150 years back, had
written songs in your praise

599
00:46:48,352 --> 00:46:54,348
Had washed my eyes with my
mother tongue's watery haze

600
00:46:54,425 --> 00:46:58,589
And now you come looking for me

601
00:47:51,081 --> 00:47:57,077
150 years back, had
looked for you, wanted to meet

602
00:47:57,321 --> 00:48:03,260
Tired and weary, had slept off
in the darkness of the street

603
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:08,026
And now you come looking for me

604
00:48:08,999 --> 00:48:15,234
150 years back, had
written songs in your praise

605
00:48:15,306 --> 00:48:21,245
Had washed my eyes with my
mother tongue's watery haze

606
00:48:21,312 --> 00:48:25,942
And now you come looking for me

607
00:48:37,995 --> 00:48:39,326
You are...

608
00:48:42,066 --> 00:48:43,658
...Antony 'Phiringi'?

609
00:48:45,002 --> 00:48:46,993
What! -
- Yes.

610
00:48:47,471 --> 00:48:49,336
I am Antony 'Phiringi'.

611
00:48:49,873 --> 00:48:50,840
Though...

612
00:48:51,842 --> 00:48:54,470
...not in this birth.
In this birth I am...

613
00:48:55,012 --> 00:48:56,673
...Kushal Hajra.

614
00:48:57,815 --> 00:49:01,251
Assistant Librarian,
Chandannagore Central Library.

615
00:49:01,452 --> 00:49:03,317
Salary; ten thousand rupees.

616
00:49:03,621 --> 00:49:05,953
I have rice in the
morning and go to work.

617
00:49:06,023 --> 00:49:08,423
Are you trying to... I mean...

618
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:10,022
...what the fu...

619
00:49:11,962 --> 00:49:14,522
Rebirth? -
- Don't be so flabbergasted, Rohit.

620
00:49:15,566 --> 00:49:17,830
The first time I saw myself I too was...

621
00:49:18,369 --> 00:49:19,700
...shocked

622
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:23,773
I choked out of fear.

623
00:49:24,541 --> 00:49:27,908
For a few hours had no
memory from either of the births,

624
00:49:27,978 --> 00:49:29,445
complete black out.

625
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:32,271
I was at Asansol back then.

626
00:49:33,284 --> 00:49:35,809
I had a good job at
a private firm.

627
00:49:36,854 --> 00:49:39,789
The doctor said, I was getting
nightmares due to work pressure.

628
00:49:41,325 --> 00:49:44,988
So I took leave for a few
days and went to Hazaribag.

629
00:49:46,864 --> 00:49:48,525
One evening,

630
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,967
I had gone for a walk.

631
00:49:52,503 --> 00:49:55,870
Far away at some temple, the
evening chants were going on.

632
00:49:57,541 --> 00:49:59,441
Suddenly, had this vision,
I saw...

633
00:50:00,711 --> 00:50:03,009
...the royal family of
Debs in Kolkata.

634
00:50:04,548 --> 00:50:05,606
The courtyard...

635
00:50:07,985 --> 00:50:09,077
...Kabigaan...

636
00:50:09,953 --> 00:50:12,285
I am singing.
So many people!

637
00:50:12,456 --> 00:50:14,947
Lights.
The hall, the applause.

638
00:50:15,025 --> 00:50:18,392
And a hefty looking man
came and put a garland...

639
00:50:18,762 --> 00:50:22,596
...a garland around
my neck...

640
00:50:24,702 --> 00:50:26,431
...a garland... -

641
00:50:27,004 --> 00:50:28,403
- Mr. Kushal...

642
00:50:29,573 --> 00:50:30,505
Mr. Kushal... -

643
00:50:30,574 --> 00:50:31,666
- No.

644
00:50:31,875 --> 00:50:32,864
Mr. Kushal?

645
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:07,903
The same story, the same visual
year after year, like a movie.

646
00:51:10,047 --> 00:51:11,537
My birth...

647
00:51:11,749 --> 00:51:13,273
...my childhood...

648
00:51:13,617 --> 00:51:15,676
...getting addicted to
Marijuana...

649
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,314
...then getting out of it.
And Saudamini...

650
00:51:19,957 --> 00:51:22,755
And then Kabigaan.
Gorokhhonath.

651
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:27,963
Learning Bengali,
writing songs in it.

652
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:29,896
In the end...

653
00:51:31,402 --> 00:51:32,391
...in the end... -

654
00:51:32,736 --> 00:51:33,566
- What?

655
00:51:33,971 --> 00:51:35,063
Nothing.

656
00:51:36,373 --> 00:51:38,739
I was used to the visions
by then.

657
00:51:39,309 --> 00:51:39,866
And...

658
00:51:40,444 --> 00:51:41,934
...through books and investigation, I...

659
00:51:42,012 --> 00:51:44,003
...came across some names and places...

660
00:51:44,081 --> 00:51:47,539
...through which I figured
out who I was in my last birth.

661
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:51,554
I also understood that...

662
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:55,586
...I can't continue with the
job in Asansol for long...

663
00:51:55,659 --> 00:51:57,456
...because my senior manager...

664
00:51:58,061 --> 00:52:01,462
...had come to know that I had
been visiting a psychiatrist.

665
00:52:02,499 --> 00:52:04,023
They created such a fuss...

666
00:52:04,768 --> 00:52:06,395
...so I quit the job...

667
00:52:07,504 --> 00:52:08,766
...and came and settled here.

668
00:52:10,441 --> 00:52:11,874
And this new job...

669
00:52:15,312 --> 00:52:16,836
...am I mad?

670
00:52:18,081 --> 00:52:20,413
Yes, no... I mean...

671
00:52:20,717 --> 00:52:21,945
...not quite...

672
00:52:22,386 --> 00:52:24,320
...err... but... -

673
00:52:24,955 --> 00:52:26,445
You don't believe me?

674
00:52:31,995 --> 00:52:32,984
No.

675
00:52:39,703 --> 00:52:41,295
I too could not believe.

676
00:52:42,739 --> 00:52:46,800
After all, I'm a rational
middle class Bengali engineer.

677
00:52:47,678 --> 00:52:49,942
I may be proud of Ritwik
Ghatak having written...

678
00:52:50,013 --> 00:52:51,674
...the film on reincarnation,
'Madhumati',

679
00:52:51,748 --> 00:52:54,080
or even be excited to watch Ray's
film on reincarnation, 'Sonar Kella'.

680
00:52:56,587 --> 00:52:58,054
Heard of lan Stevenson?

681
00:52:58,121 --> 00:53:01,284
Famous Canadian
bio-chemist and psychiatrist?

682
00:53:01,792 --> 00:53:04,761
'Twenty Cases
Suggestive of Reincarnation'?

683
00:53:06,797 --> 00:53:07,491
No.

684
00:53:08,398 --> 00:53:11,799
The case of Shanti Devi
who was declared to be...

685
00:53:11,869 --> 00:53:15,396
...a 'Jatiswar' by a scienctific
commission set up by Mahatma Gandhi?

686
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:17,033
Jatis... -

687
00:53:18,275 --> 00:53:19,401
- Jatiswar.

688
00:53:20,544 --> 00:53:22,876
Someone who has
memories from previous birth.

689
00:53:26,283 --> 00:53:27,477
But... -

690
00:53:30,354 --> 00:53:31,480
...I know.

691
00:53:33,423 --> 00:53:34,822
Not just Shanti Devi...

692
00:53:36,293 --> 00:53:38,318
...hundreds of such cases or...

693
00:53:38,862 --> 00:53:41,888
...thousands of scientific
reports would still keep...

694
00:53:41,965 --> 00:53:45,457
...would've not had any effect on my
cynicism had this not happened to me.

695
00:53:45,836 --> 00:53:49,932
So you see, Rohit, what
is 'somehow', 'but'...

696
00:53:50,574 --> 00:53:53,737
...'if', 'maybe'... to
me it is a real disease.

697
00:53:55,045 --> 00:53:57,309
A persistent feeling of deja vu,

698
00:53:57,381 --> 00:53:58,871
...a curse.

699
00:53:58,949 --> 00:53:59,881
A curse?

700
00:54:00,851 --> 00:54:03,877
Rather, you're lucky.

701
00:54:03,954 --> 00:54:06,047
How can you say such
childish things!

702
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:08,758
What's wrong with you?
I lost my job!

703
00:54:09,026 --> 00:54:11,756
I had to leave my city.
You are saying I'm lucky?

704
00:54:12,796 --> 00:54:15,594
Faces, incidents,
problems of both the...

705
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:18,567
...births are jumbling up my mind and...

706
00:54:18,635 --> 00:54:21,001
...you're saying I'm lucky?

707
00:54:21,071 --> 00:54:23,767
I'll not be able to have this
conversation after a few months,

708
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,707
...and you're saying I am lucky? -
- No... err...

709
00:54:26,777 --> 00:54:29,439
What I meant was actually... -
- What do you mean?

710
00:54:30,013 --> 00:54:31,002
What?

711
00:54:34,618 --> 00:54:35,812
Gradually,

712
00:54:36,653 --> 00:54:37,950
Antony is eating up...

713
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,783
...the memories of this brith.

714
00:54:43,393 --> 00:54:45,452
The visions are increasing.

715
00:54:46,797 --> 00:54:49,425
I'm forgetting who I am,
which language I speak in,

716
00:54:50,033 --> 00:54:51,466
how to lead a life in...

717
00:54:52,669 --> 00:54:54,330
...in the year 2013...

718
00:54:56,473 --> 00:54:58,805
When I experience these
visions...

719
00:54:59,476 --> 00:55:01,034
...my blood
pressure increases.

720
00:55:01,979 --> 00:55:03,378
Twice!

721
00:55:04,014 --> 00:55:06,244
I have had a stroke twice!

722
00:55:07,451 --> 00:55:09,043
And you will still say that I am...

723
00:55:14,324 --> 00:55:15,586
I know...

724
00:55:16,793 --> 00:55:18,055
...what my disease is...

725
00:55:19,696 --> 00:55:20,958
...but I don't know...

726
00:55:21,999 --> 00:55:24,593
...what the cure is, how long
I'll be able to survive this way.

727
00:55:26,336 --> 00:55:27,633
I don't even know...

728
00:55:29,873 --> 00:55:31,807
...how long I'll be able
to remember that I'm...

729
00:55:33,744 --> 00:55:35,006
...Kushal Hajra.

730
00:55:37,948 --> 00:55:40,075
My previous birth's memories...

731
00:55:41,051 --> 00:55:42,814
...are spreading in my mind...

732
00:55:44,321 --> 00:55:45,515
...like cancer.

733
00:55:48,759 --> 00:55:52,820
I'm melting in to the dark
and still you'll say I am...

734
00:56:08,345 --> 00:56:09,277
I'm sorry.

735
00:56:11,782 --> 00:56:13,340
I didn't mean to...

736
00:56:18,388 --> 00:56:21,482
Can I suggest something?

737
00:56:24,895 --> 00:56:27,295
Come to Kolkata with me.

738
00:56:28,365 --> 00:56:31,266
You know the disease,
not the remedy.

739
00:56:31,702 --> 00:56:34,728
So, let's go and see the
best psychiatrist in town.

740
00:56:35,372 --> 00:56:39,934
Then let's see if we can save
Kushal Hajra from Antony 'Phiringi'.

741
00:56:43,513 --> 00:56:45,606
Don't worry about the expenses.
I'll take care of it.

742
00:56:45,882 --> 00:56:47,747
And in any case, in return...

743
00:56:48,485 --> 00:56:50,646
...I need something from you.

744
00:56:52,422 --> 00:56:53,980
So, don't worry.

745
00:56:55,559 --> 00:56:56,992
No favors are
being done here.

746
00:56:58,462 --> 00:56:59,326
What?

747
00:57:00,964 --> 00:57:02,363
You'll have to...

748
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,424
...tell me the entire...

749
00:57:06,002 --> 00:57:07,594
...story of Antony.

750
00:57:09,372 --> 00:57:11,272
I need it for my
dissertation.

751
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:15,341
And may be...

752
00:57:17,814 --> 00:57:18,940
...for my life.

753
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:33,961
Intermission.

754
00:57:36,377 --> 00:57:37,469
Hello,

755
00:57:37,578 --> 00:57:40,138
we're now with the fifth
documentation of the coursework.

756
00:57:40,714 --> 00:57:43,512
It has been about seven
days we've come to Kolkata.

757
00:57:43,684 --> 00:57:47,347
I have already had two
sessions with Mr. Kushal.

758
00:57:47,621 --> 00:57:50,647
And we've covered most
of Antony's early life.

759
00:57:52,025 --> 00:57:56,155
The plan is to gather as much information
as possible about Antony...

760
00:57:56,430 --> 00:58:00,093
...before we can cross-check for
authenticity with historical sources.

761
00:58:00,534 --> 00:58:04,834
So today, we'll look into the
musical career of Heynsman Antony.

762
00:58:07,474 --> 00:58:11,911
Somehow Antony had been able to...

763
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:17,373
...come out of the infamous
company of weed-smokers.

764
00:58:18,919 --> 00:58:20,614
Slowly,

765
00:58:21,955 --> 00:58:24,082
he had started with his music.

766
00:58:25,125 --> 00:58:30,825
Kabigaan was very popular
back in those times.

767
00:58:32,499 --> 00:58:38,768
So, to listen to Kabigaan
for the first time...

768
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,665
...Antony went to...

769
00:58:42,109 --> 00:58:44,976
...'Raja' (zamindar)
Gopi Mohan Deb's court.

770
00:58:45,913 --> 00:58:47,471
Shovabajar,

771
00:58:48,982 --> 00:58:50,779
courtyard.

772
00:58:52,386 --> 00:58:57,847
The Kabigaan fight was between
veteran bard, Horu Thakur...

773
00:58:58,459 --> 00:59:02,828
...and his ex-students Nilu
Thakur and Bhawani Bene's group.

774
00:59:03,797 --> 00:59:07,790
Inspite of having many students,

775
00:59:09,369 --> 00:59:11,394
...Horu Thakur's
favourite student was...

776
00:59:13,373 --> 00:59:15,102
...Bhola 'Moyra' (sweetmeat maker).

777
00:59:15,776 --> 00:59:19,303
Which is why Nilu
Thakur and Bhawani Bene's

778
00:59:19,379 --> 00:59:22,405
...were very jealous of him.

779
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:23,811
So,

780
00:59:24,885 --> 00:59:26,614
the group of students disintegrated.

781
00:59:27,554 --> 00:59:29,351
They formed a new group.

782
00:59:31,024 --> 00:59:32,389
It was...

783
00:59:33,694 --> 00:59:35,321
...midnight.

784
00:59:35,996 --> 00:59:37,463
Horu Thakur...

785
00:59:38,365 --> 00:59:39,923
...started singing.

786
00:59:46,907 --> 00:59:50,035
Only if I had known beforehand,
my friend

787
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:57,612
That Lord Krishna's emotion
is indeed a venomous potion

788
00:59:57,885 --> 01:00:01,343
Only if I had known beforehand,
my friend

789
01:00:01,488 --> 01:00:08,587
That Lord Krishna's emotion
is mixed with a venomous potion

790
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:12,093
Only if I had known beforehand,
my friend

791
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:23,469
The Honoured,
my friends, in all innocence,

792
01:00:23,644 --> 01:00:26,807
Wouldn't have been
deceived in this way

793
01:00:27,347 --> 01:00:30,839
The Honoured,
my friends, in all innocence,

794
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:34,410
Wouldn't have been
deceived in this way

795
01:00:34,688 --> 01:00:37,953
Only if I had known beforehand,
my friend

796
01:00:38,125 --> 01:00:45,088
That Lord Krishna's emotion
is indeed a venomous potion

797
01:00:45,666 --> 01:00:48,931
Only if I had known beforehand,
my friend

798
01:00:50,137 --> 01:00:52,765
Just after Horu Thakur's
Sakhisangbad got over... -

799
01:00:52,839 --> 01:00:56,775
- Sorry. Sakhisangbad... what's that?

800
01:00:57,778 --> 01:00:59,746
A part of Kabigaan.

801
01:01:00,714 --> 01:01:03,342
There were mainly five
rounds in a Kabigaan duel.

802
01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:05,408
Bhawani bishayak...

803
01:01:05,686 --> 01:01:09,816
...where various songs were
sung about Goddess Uma or Durga.

804
01:01:10,857 --> 01:01:12,154
Sakhisangbad...

805
01:01:12,526 --> 01:01:15,051
...which was about Radha and
Krishna's love story in Vrindavan.

806
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:16,930
Viraha...

807
01:01:17,097 --> 01:01:19,088
...written about normal people,

808
01:01:19,666 --> 01:01:21,463
sad love songs.

809
01:01:21,702 --> 01:01:22,828
Kheur...

810
01:01:23,003 --> 01:01:24,664
...songs about gods and goddesses...

811
01:01:24,738 --> 01:01:27,468
...which had frivolous,
sometimes rather...

812
01:01:27,841 --> 01:01:29,775
...indecent lyrics.

813
01:01:30,577 --> 01:01:31,908
And Lahar,

814
01:01:32,346 --> 01:01:34,712
direct personal attack.

815
01:01:35,015 --> 01:01:38,815
Insulting the opponent by
singing the most indecent of verses.

816
01:01:38,952 --> 01:01:40,419
Thanks.

817
01:01:40,654 --> 01:01:41,985
Please continue.

818
01:01:42,122 --> 01:01:43,714
Brilliant! Salutations!

819
01:01:43,824 --> 01:01:47,316
Nilu Thakur realized that Horu Thakur
had impressed the 'Raja' and the audience...

820
01:01:47,361 --> 01:01:49,852
...much before he
reached Kheur round.

821
01:01:50,864 --> 01:01:52,593
So, instead of singing Kheur...

822
01:01:52,666 --> 01:01:57,603
...he sang Lahar and started insulting
Horuthakur with his vulgar verses.

823
01:01:58,739 --> 01:02:01,139
But that did not help.

824
01:02:01,408 --> 01:02:05,606
According to the Raja and the
public's verdict, Horu Thakur won.

825
01:02:05,746 --> 01:02:08,715
And Antony acquired a new passion.

826
01:02:08,882 --> 01:02:09,974
Kabigaan.

827
01:02:11,518 --> 01:02:12,951
But...

828
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:15,611
...it must have been very difficult.

829
01:02:16,289 --> 01:02:17,847
Err... I mean...

830
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:20,289
...I know that Antony...

831
01:02:20,661 --> 01:02:24,563
...had been hearing Bengali
all around him since childhood,

832
01:02:24,698 --> 01:02:27,292
he could even speak it. But...

833
01:02:27,467 --> 01:02:30,436
...writing songs in that language... -
- Of course it was difficult.

834
01:02:32,706 --> 01:02:35,004
Initially he used to
speak Sanskritized Bengali...

835
01:02:35,609 --> 01:02:37,099
...because he had
learn it from the books.

836
01:02:37,944 --> 01:02:39,912
Later, by interacting
with the natives...

837
01:02:40,647 --> 01:02:42,706
...as in the villagers...

838
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:45,747
...he learnt the
colloquial version too.

839
01:02:47,621 --> 01:02:52,024
He had written songs but
in Protuguese, not yet in Bengali.

840
01:02:54,961 --> 01:02:56,053
And then...

841
01:02:57,330 --> 01:02:58,888
...something struck him.

842
01:02:59,833 --> 01:03:02,358
The main topic of
songs back then were...

843
01:03:03,437 --> 01:03:06,497
...Vaishnav and Shakto Padabali,
as in...

844
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:09,070
...Radha, Krishna, Uma, Menoka...

845
01:03:09,142 --> 01:03:11,633
and many more...

846
01:03:12,112 --> 01:03:15,548
...of such gods and
goddesses from the Puranas.

847
01:03:15,882 --> 01:03:20,649
He began by learning
Sanskrit from a tutor at home.

848
01:03:20,921 --> 01:03:22,718
After all, the Language of the Gods.

849
01:03:22,823 --> 01:03:24,290
It took time.

850
01:03:24,424 --> 01:03:27,325
But he had learnt Latin
from his father as a kid, so...

851
01:03:27,761 --> 01:03:29,752
...though he faced problems initially,

852
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:32,091
gradually he picked up.

853
01:03:32,399 --> 01:03:34,993
After learning Sanskrit
Antony felt like he had...

854
01:03:35,368 --> 01:03:37,893
...opened a door with a key.

855
01:03:38,472 --> 01:03:43,466
He discovered a huge,
ancient, magical universe.

856
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:46,545
He had heard of it but never seen it.

857
01:03:46,847 --> 01:03:48,109
But he could see it now.

858
01:03:48,381 --> 01:03:50,349
He started reading
'Shastras' (holy scriptures).

859
01:03:50,584 --> 01:03:53,985
Vedas, Upanishads,
Puranas, Upapuranans,

860
01:03:54,454 --> 01:03:55,978
he read everthing.

861
01:03:56,656 --> 01:03:58,647
He had music in him.

862
01:03:58,925 --> 01:04:02,053
He learnt the topic and
the language of the songs.

863
01:04:02,329 --> 01:04:04,991
But to understand how that language
morphed into lyrics of a song

864
01:04:05,065 --> 01:04:07,966
he started listening
to Bengali folk music.

865
01:04:08,602 --> 01:04:11,503
Jhumur, Panchali, Murshidi, Bhawaiya,

866
01:04:11,605 --> 01:04:14,506
he'd go land up
anywhere and everywhere.

867
01:04:14,608 --> 01:04:16,701
He listened carefully. And...

868
01:04:16,777 --> 01:04:19,746
...he'd be on the look
out for Kabigaan duels.

869
01:04:19,846 --> 01:04:24,647
He'd rush to the venue,
wherever it was, village or the city.

870
01:04:24,718 --> 01:04:27,881
Bhola Moyra, Keshta 'Muchi'
(cobbler), Thakur Singha,

871
01:04:27,954 --> 01:04:31,390
Ram Basu,
these guys were the masters.

872
01:04:31,558 --> 01:04:34,755
Is he a Hindu God?

873
01:04:34,895 --> 01:04:38,797
Or a Muslim Peer?

874
01:04:38,932 --> 01:04:44,564
Oh, tell me, tell me, tell me!

875
01:04:44,638 --> 01:04:50,338
Oh, tell me, tell me, tell me!

876
01:04:51,311 --> 01:04:56,647
So now you understand,
this Horu Thakur of yours

877
01:04:56,716 --> 01:04:59,879
is not the Lord Krishna we know

878
01:05:00,554 --> 01:05:07,016
He's the universe while this
one's a retard, dense and slow

879
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:10,592
This one's a retard, dense and slow!

880
01:05:10,664 --> 01:05:14,430
This one's a retard, dense and slow!

881
01:05:15,435 --> 01:05:20,702
During that time Antony had been to
Kumarkhali to listen to Fakiri music.

882
01:05:20,974 --> 01:05:24,102
A student of Shiraj Shah,
had become very famous.

883
01:05:26,279 --> 01:05:30,943
No one's interested in the truth

884
01:05:31,017 --> 01:05:35,420
No one's interested in the truth

885
01:05:35,522 --> 01:05:39,652
Only brouhaha, meaningless

886
01:05:39,826 --> 01:05:44,092
Rancour, in the name of caste

887
01:05:44,464 --> 01:05:49,026
Is indeed a strange business

888
01:05:49,302 --> 01:05:53,295
Rancour, in the name of caste

889
01:05:53,473 --> 01:05:57,933
One who visits the whore on the sly

890
01:05:58,111 --> 01:06:01,376
Is called faithless, I wonder why

891
01:06:01,615 --> 01:06:03,310
- Listening to his music Antony understood,

892
01:06:03,416 --> 01:06:06,908
even after the melody,
the lyrics and the topic of the song,

893
01:06:06,987 --> 01:06:09,319
a huge component remains.

894
01:06:10,624 --> 01:06:11,818
The philosophy.

895
01:06:12,025 --> 01:06:16,359
Lalon wonders what indeed is caste

896
01:06:16,730 --> 01:06:19,665
Lalon wonders

897
01:06:20,367 --> 01:06:23,495
Fakir Lalon wonders

898
01:06:23,570 --> 01:06:25,435
Lalon wonders

899
01:06:25,538 --> 01:06:29,872
Lalon wonders what indeed is caste

900
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:34,338
A strange deception
which never ceases

901
01:06:34,514 --> 01:06:38,644
Rancour, in the name of caste

902
01:06:38,952 --> 01:06:43,582
Is indeed a strange business

903
01:06:43,657 --> 01:06:47,593
Rancour, in the name of caste

904
01:06:47,994 --> 01:06:52,624
No one's interested in the truth

905
01:06:53,366 --> 01:06:56,893
At a point he realized
a 'Dnarakabi' group was... -

906
01:06:57,037 --> 01:06:58,732
- Sorry. 'Dnarakabi'?

907
01:06:58,939 --> 01:07:01,430
Ameteur bards. As in...

908
01:07:01,908 --> 01:07:04,604
...you could say, an amateur group.

909
01:07:04,878 --> 01:07:08,905
So, Antony thought of
forming an amateur group.

910
01:07:09,883 --> 01:07:12,408
Which is when he met...

911
01:07:13,053 --> 01:07:15,078
...an upcoming 'Bnadhandaar'.

912
01:07:16,456 --> 01:07:17,855
Gorokhhonath.

913
01:07:18,325 --> 01:07:19,485
Sorry...

914
01:07:19,592 --> 01:07:22,584
...'Bnadhandar' was the person who would
compose the lyrics for the bard.

915
01:07:22,796 --> 01:07:26,095
It's not that all bards would
sing songs written by themselves.

916
01:07:26,366 --> 01:07:28,698
The groups often had 'Bnadhandars'.

917
01:07:30,403 --> 01:07:31,631
So you're coming?

918
01:07:31,705 --> 01:07:34,367
Hope there will be some
depressing snacks for lunch?

919
01:07:34,474 --> 01:07:35,805
For sure.

920
01:07:35,875 --> 01:07:39,709
And some fat books on Bengali literature
to be used as paper weights.

921
01:07:40,914 --> 01:07:41,972
Fine then.

922
01:07:42,482 --> 01:07:43,813
I'll have a look at my schedule.

923
01:07:43,984 --> 01:07:45,611
We need to screen a lot of bands.

924
01:07:45,785 --> 01:07:47,980
We need to separate
the wheat from the chaff.

925
01:07:48,088 --> 01:07:50,989
Yes. More than a thousand
bands have registered.

926
01:07:51,057 --> 01:07:55,357
And the judges will be divided
into groups to screen them.

927
01:07:56,763 --> 01:07:59,357
Your remuneration?

928
01:07:59,632 --> 01:08:02,362
Everything depends
on my work pressure.

929
01:08:02,469 --> 01:08:05,131
There will be a bit of
work pressure at that time...

930
01:08:05,405 --> 01:08:07,600
...but I'll definitely
try to make it.

931
01:08:07,941 --> 01:08:09,738
I'll be happy to judge.

932
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:25,985
Okay listen,
when you go to meet Rupam,

933
01:08:26,059 --> 01:08:28,493
please take me with you,
I think he's very cute.

934
01:08:28,828 --> 01:08:32,821
You haven't heard Rupam Islam
music enough to find him cute.

935
01:08:32,999 --> 01:08:33,897
Shut up, moron!

936
01:08:34,034 --> 01:08:36,662
Oh please! - -Hello brother...

937
01:08:36,903 --> 01:08:38,495
...we're hungry. Come fast.

938
01:08:39,105 --> 01:08:43,132
Listen, get us one Keema Matar,
one Chicken Bharta,

939
01:08:43,343 --> 01:08:45,971
two boneleess Mutton tadkas,
and Nan for any of you?

940
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:46,977
None of us.

941
01:08:47,047 --> 01:08:49,515
Four Tawa rotis,
we'll tell you if we need more.

942
01:08:49,616 --> 01:08:52,380
And one Masala cold drink,
without lime.

943
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:54,914
Salad? Onions? -
- No!

944
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:05,794
You can find mouth freshners
in India, you know.

945
01:09:05,865 --> 01:09:09,357
No, you see...
onions aren't good for health.

946
01:09:09,436 --> 01:09:12,803
Don't overdo it. You'll
have to see a doctor eventually!

947
01:09:12,872 --> 01:09:16,364
What you need more than a doctor,
Mr. Hajra...

948
01:09:16,643 --> 01:09:18,076
...is rest.

949
01:09:18,378 --> 01:09:22,974
These hallucinations, visions or
nightmares; whatever you call them,

950
01:09:23,049 --> 01:09:26,849
if they keep increasing then
it's going to take a toll on your... -

951
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:27,944
- Heart.

952
01:09:28,054 --> 01:09:29,783
Tell me something new, doctor.

953
01:09:30,323 --> 01:09:32,450
Something I don't know.

954
01:09:33,126 --> 01:09:34,423
Like...

955
01:09:35,328 --> 01:09:36,659
...will this ever get cured?

956
01:09:37,497 --> 01:09:39,089
Will it ever... - -See...

957
01:09:39,365 --> 01:09:42,391
...I've spoken to three
internationally acclaimed...

958
01:09:42,502 --> 01:09:44,993
...parapsychologists
regarding your problem.

959
01:09:45,338 --> 01:09:48,739
I've had a detailed discussion
with Dr. Debasish Ghosh here as well.

960
01:09:48,842 --> 01:09:50,139
Let me explain.

961
01:09:52,912 --> 01:09:56,871
This part of the brain
is called Hippocampal gyrus.

962
01:09:57,517 --> 01:09:58,916
This is our memory centre.

963
01:09:58,985 --> 01:10:02,113
New and old,
all memories are stored here.

964
01:10:02,755 --> 01:10:04,882
Now this Hippocampalgyrus...

965
01:10:05,358 --> 01:10:07,417
...can be aroused
in many ways. Like...

966
01:10:07,494 --> 01:10:11,487
...ringing bells in temple chants,
chanting of the word 'Om' etc.

967
01:10:11,664 --> 01:10:15,122
...all of these generate
3.5 Hz brainwave.

968
01:10:15,401 --> 01:10:17,301
At this 3.5 Hz...

969
01:10:17,403 --> 01:10:20,304
...Hippocampal gyrusstarts resonating.

970
01:10:20,473 --> 01:10:25,342
During that, the old memory,
even past life memory may come back.

971
01:10:25,845 --> 01:10:27,870
Now the second possible explanation.

972
01:10:28,047 --> 01:10:30,106
There's a gland called
the Pineal gland here,

973
01:10:30,316 --> 01:10:32,682
which is called, the Third eye.

974
01:10:32,886 --> 01:10:36,982
Now, we don't know how or why
this gets aroused but if it does...

975
01:10:37,123 --> 01:10:40,581
...your lost memory
may suddenly come back.

976
01:10:41,394 --> 01:10:44,022
The third explanation is,
genetic memory.

977
01:10:44,397 --> 01:10:47,491
Carl Jung said,
'Collective unconscious'.

978
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,127
We're all connected to each
other in some way or the other...

979
01:10:51,337 --> 01:10:52,599
...via our DNA.

980
01:10:53,006 --> 01:10:58,410
This too is possible that
you may have a genetic connect...

981
01:10:58,645 --> 01:11:01,671
...with the person,
whose memories have come back to you.

982
01:11:01,848 --> 01:11:03,509
Whatever that may be...

983
01:11:03,917 --> 01:11:09,014
...now the problem is, the memories
that are coming back to you...

984
01:11:09,422 --> 01:11:13,950
...if they keep increasing
in frequency and intensity,

985
01:11:14,127 --> 01:11:17,096
it may subvert your
present memory and...

986
01:11:17,363 --> 01:11:19,957
...turn these memories
into your dominant memories.

987
01:11:20,033 --> 01:11:22,092
And during this,

988
01:11:22,402 --> 01:11:25,462
not only schizophrenia
and split personality,

989
01:11:25,638 --> 01:11:29,870
...there's a chance of identity
crisis or memory replacement too. -

990
01:11:29,943 --> 01:11:34,039
- Just a minute. Can you explain
this in an easier language.

991
01:11:35,481 --> 01:11:39,383
As in, how long will
his normal memory last?

992
01:11:39,719 --> 01:11:43,086
As in, before he... -
- Before I lose himself.

993
01:11:43,856 --> 01:11:46,791
Well, difficult to say.
Matters of the brain, you see.

994
01:11:47,026 --> 01:11:49,893
May take weeks or even a year.

995
01:11:50,096 --> 01:11:53,088
Depends on the rate of replacement
by the dominant memory.

996
01:11:53,499 --> 01:11:56,935
See, due to the neural
plasticity of the Hippocampus,

997
01:11:57,136 --> 01:11:59,104
a consolidation of memory occurs.

998
01:11:59,339 --> 01:12:00,704
May lead to a regression too.

999
01:12:00,773 --> 01:12:02,968
As in, this growth may become slower.

1000
01:12:03,476 --> 01:12:06,502
It may even come
to a halt one fine day.

1001
01:12:06,613 --> 01:12:08,012
Yes!

1002
01:12:08,081 --> 01:12:10,015
But how?

1003
01:12:10,149 --> 01:12:14,108
Avery common and easy
way is reconciliation.

1004
01:12:14,654 --> 01:12:19,819
As in revisiting the places and the
people whom you see in the visions.

1005
01:12:19,993 --> 01:12:21,392
No, that's not working.

1006
01:12:21,461 --> 01:12:26,524
That's why I shifted to Chandannagore
from Asansol but it increased.

1007
01:12:26,699 --> 01:12:28,929
Next... as in is there another way?

1008
01:12:30,003 --> 01:12:31,436
There is another way.

1009
01:12:31,838 --> 01:12:33,567
Past life regression.

1010
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:37,833
Do you have any trauma
from your past life...

1011
01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:40,071
...that had given you a big shock?

1012
01:12:40,313 --> 01:12:44,374
Or a very important task
that you couldn't complete?

1013
01:12:45,118 --> 01:12:49,817
Mr. Hajra, were you looking
for someone or something?

1014
01:12:50,823 --> 01:12:52,723
Or are you still searching?

1015
01:12:58,631 --> 01:13:01,896
Don't worry,
I think whatever had happened...

1016
01:13:04,404 --> 01:13:08,431
...I think you must
not worry about this.

1017
01:13:08,708 --> 01:13:10,903
Things will get better. You... -

1018
01:13:10,977 --> 01:13:12,945
- Hey wait! Stop the car!

1019
01:13:13,046 --> 01:13:14,513
Stop! - -What happened?

1020
01:13:14,681 --> 01:13:16,080
What happened Mr. Kushal...

1021
01:13:16,349 --> 01:13:18,613
...where are you going! Mr. Kushal...

1022
01:13:19,552 --> 01:13:21,986
Don't go Mr. Kushal!

1023
01:13:22,055 --> 01:13:23,545
Wait!

1024
01:13:23,823 --> 01:13:25,654
What are you doing? Leave me!

1025
01:13:26,025 --> 01:13:27,083
He's...

1026
01:13:28,294 --> 01:13:29,386
...okay fine.

1027
01:13:30,730 --> 01:13:31,822
Pull over.

1028
01:13:31,898 --> 01:13:33,456
Pull over.

1029
01:13:33,833 --> 01:13:35,528
Mr. Kushal!

1030
01:13:35,768 --> 01:13:37,736
Give way, will you?

1031
01:14:15,708 --> 01:14:17,073
Greetings, sahib.

1032
01:14:18,644 --> 01:14:21,579
Some cash is required
to build the wall on the North.

1033
01:14:21,781 --> 01:14:25,273
So Madam asked me to tell you. -

1034
01:14:25,318 --> 01:14:27,013
- Come and take it tomorrow.

1035
01:14:27,553 --> 01:14:30,351
So, where is she?

1036
01:14:30,523 --> 01:14:35,051
She was here a while ago. Should I... -
- That won't be necessary.

1037
01:14:36,529 --> 01:14:38,588
I will find Soudamini myself.

1038
01:14:46,873 --> 01:14:48,864
Mr. Kushal...

1039
01:14:49,342 --> 01:14:51,708
...what are you looking at?
Let's go! Mr. Kushal...

1040
01:14:52,311 --> 01:14:53,938
Mr. Kushal, come with me.

1041
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:12,859
Come on, let's leave!

1042
01:15:25,445 --> 01:15:27,845
Amitabh and Sudeshna
have settled down too.

1043
01:15:28,714 --> 01:15:30,511
At least now you
must look for someone.

1044
01:15:30,583 --> 01:15:32,949
Love is incapable of taming me.

1045
01:15:33,085 --> 01:15:36,350
And I can't settle down with someone.
I'll have to unsettle up.

1046
01:15:36,589 --> 01:15:37,385
Why?

1047
01:15:37,590 --> 01:15:39,023
Sujit was a nice guy.

1048
01:15:39,091 --> 01:15:40,319
Waste of time.

1049
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:42,451
And Amiya? -
- Casting pearls before swine.

1050
01:15:42,562 --> 01:15:44,757
Oh really! And you are such a pearl!

1051
01:15:44,931 --> 01:15:47,297
Human Elsa. Born Free.

1052
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:50,301
That's enough! Arguing all the time.

1053
01:15:50,903 --> 01:15:53,838
Switch on the Bengali
channel on the TV.

1054
01:15:54,006 --> 01:15:56,372
My serial is about to begin.

1055
01:16:42,288 --> 01:16:45,815
What's this?
Have you really gone mad?

1056
01:16:45,958 --> 01:16:49,689
Why this Gujarati channel? Asked
you to switch on the Bengali channel.

1057
01:16:51,831 --> 01:16:53,560
705.

1058
01:17:32,438 --> 01:17:37,432
Mom, when did you realize
that Dad's case was real?

1059
01:17:40,046 --> 01:17:41,013
Huh?

1060
01:17:41,614 --> 01:17:43,582
Real? -
- Hmm.

1061
01:17:45,818 --> 01:17:49,117
It's not an infatuation
or a passing phase...

1062
01:17:49,355 --> 01:17:50,913
...it's the real thing.

1063
01:17:53,125 --> 01:17:55,355
True love...

1064
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:57,619
...and all that jazz.

1065
01:18:03,736 --> 01:18:05,931
On my way back from the crematorium...

1066
01:18:23,422 --> 01:18:24,753
Mr. Kushal...

1067
01:18:26,325 --> 01:18:27,121
...come.

1068
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:35,397
What? Come inside.

1069
01:18:36,035 --> 01:18:37,127
Sit.

1070
01:18:51,083 --> 01:18:52,141
Tell me.

1071
01:18:57,456 --> 01:18:58,684
Any problem?

1072
01:19:00,726 --> 01:19:02,023
Can't get sleep?

1073
01:19:05,965 --> 01:19:07,796
Sorry.

1074
01:19:09,535 --> 01:19:10,524
Sorry?

1075
01:19:12,004 --> 01:19:13,096
For what?

1076
01:19:16,042 --> 01:19:17,304
I mean...

1077
01:19:19,345 --> 01:19:22,371
...anything could've
happened on the road.

1078
01:19:25,384 --> 01:19:26,749
Because of...

1079
01:19:31,023 --> 01:19:32,820
...I lost myself.

1080
01:19:39,732 --> 01:19:41,757
Don't even think
about it, Mr. Kushal.

1081
01:19:46,839 --> 01:19:48,830
Losing yourself for something,

1082
01:19:50,943 --> 01:19:52,774
I know how that feels.

1083
01:19:57,149 --> 01:19:58,912
It's not always in your control.

1084
01:20:00,953 --> 01:20:02,147
Thank you.

1085
01:20:21,674 --> 01:20:22,732
What are you writing?

1086
01:20:25,411 --> 01:20:26,776
All that I've...

1087
01:20:27,113 --> 01:20:28,603
...read...

1088
01:20:28,814 --> 01:20:30,543
...learnt...

1089
01:20:31,117 --> 01:20:34,109
...understood...
felt... all these years...

1090
01:20:34,587 --> 01:20:35,952
...now they want to come out.

1091
01:20:36,922 --> 01:20:38,014
What is it?

1092
01:20:38,491 --> 01:20:39,458
A song?

1093
01:20:40,893 --> 01:20:41,882
Want to listen to it?

1094
01:20:42,695 --> 01:20:44,060
This is the first draft.

1095
01:20:44,497 --> 01:20:46,624
Written for someone very special.

1096
01:20:46,866 --> 01:20:48,060
Okay.

1097
01:20:48,734 --> 01:20:49,792
So...

1098
01:20:50,002 --> 01:20:51,469
...what's her name?

1099
01:20:54,373 --> 01:20:56,000
As they say...

1100
01:20:56,742 --> 01:20:58,642
...everything is 'Maya' (illusion).

1101
01:21:43,122 --> 01:21:51,621
Into my life, Out of the blue,
Did you arrive, Tell me, did you?

1102
01:21:51,697 --> 01:22:00,071
My broken life, It's frayed brink,
Of city-days', just at the kink,

1103
01:22:00,406 --> 01:22:06,811
Into my life, Out of the blue,
Did you arrive, Tell me, did you?

1104
01:22:06,879 --> 01:22:13,648
My broken life, It's frayed brink,
Of city-days', just at the kink,

1105
01:22:13,719 --> 01:22:17,450
Did you arrive, Tell me, did you?

1106
01:23:00,366 --> 01:23:04,097
Alas no more You will get here,

1107
01:23:04,570 --> 01:23:08,734
A thing you can, Consider dear,

1108
01:23:08,941 --> 01:23:12,707
With ease.

1109
01:23:13,078 --> 01:23:17,037
O where was I
Going as such,

1110
01:23:17,516 --> 01:23:21,646
From where was I Expecting much,

1111
01:23:21,787 --> 01:23:25,086
With ease.

1112
01:23:25,891 --> 01:23:29,987
Now simple words, Are hardly that,

1113
01:23:30,362 --> 01:23:34,389
Survival's prime Simple format.

1114
01:23:34,466 --> 01:23:40,928
My broken life, It's frayed brink,
Of city-days', just at the kink,

1115
01:23:41,307 --> 01:23:49,681
Into my life, Out of the blue,
Did you arrive, Tell me, did you?

1116
01:23:49,748 --> 01:23:58,349
Into my life, Out of the blue,
Did you arrive, Tell me, did you?

1117
01:24:02,962 --> 01:24:04,361
This is how I...

1118
01:24:06,565 --> 01:24:07,827
...met her for
the first time.

1119
01:24:11,437 --> 01:24:12,369
I mean...

1120
01:24:15,441 --> 01:24:18,740
...Antony met
Soudamini for the first time.

1121
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:22,880
Cinematic stuff.

1122
01:24:29,355 --> 01:24:30,720
You could say so.

1123
01:24:40,532 --> 01:24:41,726
Where's your...

1124
01:24:43,569 --> 01:24:44,729
...camera?

1125
01:24:46,038 --> 01:24:47,835
Didn't record this?

1126
01:24:51,610 --> 01:24:52,634
No.

1127
01:24:54,413 --> 01:24:55,710
Not this one.

1128
01:25:11,864 --> 01:25:13,456
Perfect!

1129
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:16,691
I want to go home!

1130
01:25:18,537 --> 01:25:19,697
Hello.

1131
01:25:20,305 --> 01:25:22,603
I want to register
for Bandemonium.

1132
01:25:23,609 --> 01:25:24,769
Here's my entry.

1133
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:30,541
Another weirdo!

1134
01:25:31,417 --> 01:25:32,816
Details please.

1135
01:25:32,985 --> 01:25:34,350
Hmmm. Nice body!

1136
01:25:34,553 --> 01:25:37,545
Details, as in? -
- As in your name,

1137
01:25:37,623 --> 01:25:38,988
your father's name,

1138
01:25:39,058 --> 01:25:41,322
your manager's name.

1139
01:25:42,061 --> 01:25:44,529
Antony.
Henysman Antony.

1140
01:25:46,065 --> 01:25:48,898
Damned Anglo-Indian for sure!

1141
01:25:49,101 --> 01:25:51,331
Woah! What a sexy name!

1142
01:25:53,539 --> 01:25:54,870
Which college?

1143
01:25:56,308 --> 01:25:57,900
Or university?

1144
01:25:58,911 --> 01:26:01,004
Humboldt university.

1145
01:26:02,381 --> 01:26:03,643
Sorry.

1146
01:26:03,816 --> 01:26:05,545
Humboldt university,
second year.

1147
01:26:05,717 --> 01:26:06,911
Portuguese studies.

1148
01:26:08,020 --> 01:26:11,046
How many members in the band?

1149
01:26:11,490 --> 01:26:13,685
Members? Err...

1150
01:26:13,992 --> 01:26:15,926
...I am alone.

1151
01:26:16,061 --> 01:26:19,724
Oh God! This is a band show,
not a solo.

1152
01:26:19,965 --> 01:26:23,799
Wasted my time...
read and come next time.

1153
01:26:24,403 --> 01:26:26,769
No, but I... -
- Now please go!

1154
01:26:26,839 --> 01:26:28,773
I've a lot of work to do.

1155
01:26:28,874 --> 01:26:29,932
Now go!

1156
01:26:30,275 --> 01:26:32,004
Please go will you?

1157
01:26:45,324 --> 01:26:47,292
Band of idiots!

1158
01:26:53,332 --> 01:26:54,458
Excuse me.

1159
01:26:57,970 --> 01:27:00,097
What now? -
- Take down the band's name.

1160
01:27:01,306 --> 01:27:03,001
What! -
- The band's name.

1161
01:27:03,609 --> 01:27:04,974
Pharashdanga Graduate band.

1162
01:27:05,043 --> 01:27:06,101
What 'danga'?

1163
01:27:08,614 --> 01:27:10,946
I clearly remember my... I mean...

1164
01:27:11,016 --> 01:27:12,108
...sorry...

1165
01:27:12,351 --> 01:27:15,616
...Antony's first Kabigaan fight.

1166
01:27:15,921 --> 01:27:18,981
The opponent was the
famous female bard,

1167
01:27:19,091 --> 01:27:20,490
Jogyeshwari.

1168
01:27:20,659 --> 01:27:21,921
Rumour was...

1169
01:27:21,994 --> 01:27:23,894
...she was Ram Basu's girlfriend.

1170
01:27:24,029 --> 01:27:25,121
Wow!

1171
01:27:25,664 --> 01:27:28,326
Bob Dylan-Joan Baez of that era?

1172
01:27:39,344 --> 01:27:40,106
Wow.

1173
01:27:40,812 --> 01:27:44,339
I see that Sahib has come
in the guise of a Bengali.

1174
01:27:45,918 --> 01:27:47,010
Yes.

1175
01:27:47,886 --> 01:27:49,979
Just like you've come in
the guise of a woman.

1176
01:28:17,082 --> 01:28:20,108
Since you have become my soul mate

1177
01:28:20,385 --> 01:28:22,046
Let me confide in you,

1178
01:28:22,921 --> 01:28:25,822
Since you have become my soul mate

1179
01:28:25,991 --> 01:28:27,788
Let me confide in you,

1180
01:28:28,627 --> 01:28:35,795
A glance at your face
and I get over my blues

1181
01:28:36,368 --> 01:28:43,797
A glance at your face
and I get over my blues

1182
01:28:43,976 --> 01:28:47,036
Since you have become my soul mate

1183
01:28:47,112 --> 01:28:48,773
Let me confide in you,

1184
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:08,391
Imprisoned by love,
slow and surely I get tamed

1185
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:15,863
The 'virtuos' woman that I am,
what am I without a husband?

1186
01:29:16,475 --> 01:29:24,007
Imprisoned by love,
slow and surely I get tamed

1187
01:29:24,316 --> 01:29:31,085
The 'virtuos' woman that I am,
what am I without a husband?

1188
01:29:31,590 --> 01:29:38,928
Forsake your home, be
it spring or monsoon,

1189
01:29:39,431 --> 01:29:46,894
Deny the pious and satiate me soon.

1190
01:29:47,072 --> 01:29:50,007
Since you have become my soul mate

1191
01:29:50,342 --> 01:29:51,775
Let me confide in you,

1192
01:29:52,744 --> 01:29:55,770
Since you have become my soul mate

1193
01:29:55,847 --> 01:29:57,747
Let me confide in you,

1194
01:29:58,483 --> 01:30:05,855
A glance at your face
and I get over my blues

1195
01:30:06,091 --> 01:30:09,390
Since you have become my soul mate

1196
01:30:09,461 --> 01:30:11,019
Let me confide in you,

1197
01:30:11,863 --> 01:30:14,923
Since you have become my soul mate

1198
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:17,000
Let me confide in you,

1199
01:30:17,069 --> 01:30:19,299
Brilliant!
Salutations!

1200
01:30:19,338 --> 01:30:20,635
Just edit that bit.

1201
01:30:20,806 --> 01:30:23,536
I think there's some
problem in the monitoring.

1202
01:30:23,742 --> 01:30:25,573
Can you hear it?

1203
01:30:25,911 --> 01:30:27,071
Yes.

1204
01:30:27,312 --> 01:30:29,542
In that case, you know
how humans growl?

1205
01:30:29,614 --> 01:30:31,548
I want that sort of a growl,
like a human or a beast, you get it?

1206
01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:33,743
And practice the scatting bit too.

1207
01:30:41,426 --> 01:30:43,917
Antony's group had
just started the 'Jill'.

1208
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:46,656
'Jill'? Jacking
me with jargons again?

1209
01:30:46,865 --> 01:30:47,991
Sorry.

1210
01:30:48,633 --> 01:30:51,659
'Jill'... it is like
a commencement...

1211
01:30:51,903 --> 01:30:54,133
...with instruments like
'dhol' and 'kasha'.

1212
01:30:54,339 --> 01:30:55,328
As in...

1213
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,635
...like musically
challenging your opponent.

1214
01:30:58,643 --> 01:31:03,012
As soon as that happened, I,
as in Antony, started getting tense.

1215
01:31:03,749 --> 01:31:06,445
It was the first
duel after all.

1216
01:31:06,651 --> 01:31:10,519
But the moment I, I mean
Antony stood up...

1217
01:31:10,856 --> 01:31:14,348
...the moment he started singing the
Viraha written by Gorokkho...

1218
01:31:14,693 --> 01:31:18,789
...that was it. The public, the
judge and the opponet went mute.

1219
01:31:22,934 --> 01:31:26,370
The first time when
you went on stage...

1220
01:31:26,438 --> 01:31:29,635
...did you have stage fright? -
- My first performance...

1221
01:31:29,775 --> 01:31:31,436
...there have been
many kinds of first times.

1222
01:31:31,543 --> 01:31:33,443
But yes, speaking of stage frights...

1223
01:31:33,645 --> 01:31:37,809
...let me tell you about the
first time I performed my songs,

1224
01:31:37,883 --> 01:31:41,580
when I got on stage to perform
my own songs the first time,

1225
01:31:41,987 --> 01:31:43,614
I was scared.

1226
01:31:45,357 --> 01:31:46,722
But then...

1227
01:31:47,426 --> 01:31:50,691
...the dark silhouetted
heads of the audience...

1228
01:31:51,029 --> 01:31:52,587
...the blinding lights...

1229
01:31:53,031 --> 01:31:55,966
...the microphone's metalic echo...

1230
01:31:56,701 --> 01:31:57,759
...set everything right.

1231
01:31:58,003 --> 01:32:02,997
Not anymore, my love,
don't come in my way

1232
01:32:03,442 --> 01:32:08,402
Not anymore, my love,
don't come in my way

1233
01:32:09,114 --> 01:32:14,108
Not anymore, my love,
don't come in my way

1234
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:19,721
Not anymore, my love,
don't come in my way

1235
01:32:19,958 --> 01:32:25,954
Can't understand your visits

1236
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:35,704
Please pay heed to what I say

1237
01:32:36,007 --> 01:32:40,967
Not anymore, my love,
don't come in my way

1238
01:32:41,713 --> 01:32:46,377
Not anymore, my love,
don't come in my way

1239
01:32:50,055 --> 01:32:51,750
Gorokhho!

1240
01:32:55,427 --> 01:32:56,985
Gorokhho!

1241
01:33:05,704 --> 01:33:07,831
Gorokhho!

1242
01:33:33,932 --> 01:33:35,866
Mr. Kushal...

1243
01:33:43,108 --> 01:33:44,769
Mr. Kushal...

1244
01:33:45,610 --> 01:33:47,544
Who is it? Gorokkho?

1245
01:33:48,847 --> 01:33:50,678
You're here finally?

1246
01:33:51,683 --> 01:33:54,675
You lowly money
minded swine!

1247
01:33:56,488 --> 01:33:57,682
Mr. Kushal...

1248
01:33:57,756 --> 01:34:00,418
- Why do you decieve like a woman?

1249
01:34:01,326 --> 01:34:03,692
How greedy can you get!

1250
01:34:05,330 --> 01:34:08,561
Listen... -
- Don't you know what I've lost?

1251
01:34:08,767 --> 01:34:13,329
Don't you know Kelly
cheated me off my property.

1252
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:17,399
You may be my 'Bnadhandar' but...

1253
01:34:17,576 --> 01:34:21,512
...I too can compose songs for
duels if it comes to that, remember!

1254
01:34:21,947 --> 01:34:23,539
Mr. Kushal... I am...

1255
01:34:23,915 --> 01:34:26,509
Now go! Get lost!

1256
01:34:26,751 --> 01:34:29,549
You nasty maggot!
Go away!

1257
01:34:29,955 --> 01:34:32,753
You greedy dog!

1258
01:34:32,924 --> 01:34:34,721
Get lost from here!

1259
01:34:34,826 --> 01:34:36,020
Go away!

1260
01:34:38,063 --> 01:34:39,052
Mr. Kushal...

1261
01:34:39,364 --> 01:34:41,059
Mr. Kushal... please!

1262
01:34:41,366 --> 01:34:44,631
See, I have already
committed to a duel in Chinsura.

1263
01:34:44,869 --> 01:34:47,599
Our group has earned a
bit of a reputation.

1264
01:34:47,806 --> 01:34:50,639
This one last time,
after that I'll...

1265
01:34:51,376 --> 01:34:52,070
Mr. Kushal...

1266
01:34:52,310 --> 01:34:54,403
...pay you the price you want.

1267
01:34:54,546 --> 01:34:56,537
The salary you ask for.

1268
01:34:57,048 --> 01:34:59,482
Mr. Kushal! Geta hold on yourself!

1269
01:34:59,985 --> 01:35:00,849
It's me!

1270
01:35:00,919 --> 01:35:02,477
I'm Rohit.

1271
01:35:02,687 --> 01:35:03,984
I'm Rohit, Mr. Kushal.

1272
01:35:12,731 --> 01:35:13,857
Mr. Kushal...

1273
01:35:14,766 --> 01:35:15,892
What's wrong with you?

1274
01:35:17,802 --> 01:35:18,962
Mr. Kushal?

1275
01:35:22,741 --> 01:35:23,901
Rohit.

1276
01:35:26,678 --> 01:35:27,610
Camera.

1277
01:35:30,882 --> 01:35:32,281
Losing out on time.

1278
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:36,014
I'm...

1279
01:35:36,721 --> 01:35:38,313
...sinking fast.

1280
01:36:04,315 --> 01:36:07,978
Because Gorokhhonath refused
to compose lyrics for me...

1281
01:36:08,353 --> 01:36:11,948
...I myself had to start
composing for the Kabigaan duels.

1282
01:36:12,724 --> 01:36:14,385
And after composing my first song...

1283
01:36:15,493 --> 01:36:17,586
...I never had to look back.

1284
01:36:19,064 --> 01:36:20,827
It was my...

1285
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:22,889
...first duel with Ram Basu.

1286
01:36:23,034 --> 01:36:30,065
What are your devious ways,
O Goddess, of ignoring me?

1287
01:36:30,642 --> 01:36:35,944
Will you have mercy on me,
finally?

1288
01:36:36,781 --> 01:36:40,774
I am a foreigner by birth,
O Goddess

1289
01:36:41,086 --> 01:36:45,614
Hence you ignore me and go away

1290
01:36:45,690 --> 01:36:49,456
I am a foreigner by birth,
O Goddess

1291
01:36:49,561 --> 01:36:52,553
I don't know how to
chant and pray

1292
01:36:52,630 --> 01:37:00,332
I don't know how to pray to you,
so my prayers go unanswered

1293
01:37:00,772 --> 01:37:08,042
I don't know how to pray to you,
so my prayers go unanswered

1294
01:37:10,648 --> 01:37:15,085
So the foreigner will
seek your blessings Matangi,

1295
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:18,812
Till his voice his heard

1296
01:37:19,324 --> 01:37:21,485
The Goddess Matangi blessed me.

1297
01:37:21,726 --> 01:37:24,058
I had already beaten Jogyeshwari.

1298
01:37:24,329 --> 01:37:26,388
Later I beat Ram Basu, Keshta Muchi,

1299
01:37:26,498 --> 01:37:29,467
Jogeshwar 'Dhopa'
(washerman) and even Thakur Singha.

1300
01:37:33,705 --> 01:37:40,440
Tell me, O Antony, could
you please kindly explain

1301
01:37:40,645 --> 01:37:47,710
Having come to my country, why
aren't you dressed like clergymen?

1302
01:37:47,886 --> 01:37:54,416
Tell me, O Antony, could
you please kindly explain

1303
01:37:54,626 --> 01:38:01,589
Having come to my country, why
aren't you dressed like clergymen?

1304
01:38:01,666 --> 01:38:04,430
Tell me, O Antony

1305
01:38:12,110 --> 01:38:18,811
Tell me, O Antony, where are
your shoes and boots and socks

1306
01:38:18,883 --> 01:38:25,880
Tell me, O Antony, where are
your shoes and boots and socks

1307
01:38:26,090 --> 01:38:31,494
It seems you favour our sandals more

1308
01:38:31,596 --> 01:38:38,968
Could you solve this little
paradox?

1309
01:38:39,437 --> 01:38:43,373
Could you solve this little
paradox?

1310
01:38:43,575 --> 01:38:50,504
Tell me, O Antony, could
you please kindly explain

1311
01:38:50,615 --> 01:38:57,043
Having come to my country, why
aren't you dressed like clergymen?

1312
01:38:57,488 --> 01:39:00,616
Tell me, O Antony

1313
01:39:01,726 --> 01:39:05,628
Well done! Brilliant!

1314
01:39:32,323 --> 01:39:43,791
I'm quite happy in my
Bengalin my fancy Bengali dress

1315
01:39:51,876 --> 01:39:57,940
Being Thakur Singha's son-in-law
have forsaken my foreign ways

1316
01:40:01,719 --> 01:40:13,859
I'm quite happy in my
Bengalin my fancy Bengali dress

1317
01:40:15,867 --> 01:40:21,828
Being Thakur Singha's son-in-law
have forsaken my foreign ways

1318
01:40:35,486 --> 01:40:42,324
Father-in-laws and
son-in-laws have common ways, you see

1319
01:40:42,660 --> 01:40:49,327
Father-in-laws and
son-in-laws have common ways, you see

1320
01:40:49,867 --> 01:40:56,397
I belong to the soil of Bengal
and Bengal belongs to me

1321
01:40:59,444 --> 01:41:05,041
I belong to the soil of Bengal
and Bengal belongs to me

1322
01:41:05,116 --> 01:41:09,052
Bengal belongs to him!

1323
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:12,851
Bengal belongs to him!

1324
01:41:12,957 --> 01:41:15,357
Not only Viraha, Kheur and Lahar,

1325
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:17,819
my most popular genre was the...

1326
01:41:17,895 --> 01:41:20,386
...the welcome songs
of Mother Goddess Durga.

1327
01:41:32,377 --> 01:41:36,609
Hail O Goddess Mahamaya

1328
01:41:37,048 --> 01:41:40,711
Your endless clemency

1329
01:41:41,819 --> 01:41:45,721
Hail O Goddess Mahamaya

1330
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:50,390
Your endless clemency

1331
01:41:51,095 --> 01:41:55,691
One who invokes you,
O Mother Durga

1332
01:41:55,867 --> 01:42:00,804
You take care of his destiny

1333
01:42:19,290 --> 01:42:23,920
Hence I cry out to you, O Mother,
in this mortal world

1334
01:42:23,995 --> 01:42:28,091
I cry out in distress

1335
01:42:28,366 --> 01:42:33,463
But you pay no heed
to your son, O Mother

1336
01:42:33,671 --> 01:42:38,108
Why are you so heartless?

1337
01:42:57,128 --> 01:43:00,928
Admitted, I have been a bad son

1338
01:43:01,799 --> 01:43:05,758
But why will you be
a bad mother?

1339
01:43:05,837 --> 01:43:10,934
Like you were born of a stone

1340
01:43:11,142 --> 01:43:14,771
You behave like no other

1341
01:43:15,713 --> 01:43:20,275
Tell me, O Merciful one,
tell me

1342
01:43:20,551 --> 01:43:24,920
Will I have your blessing eventually?

1343
01:43:25,089 --> 01:43:29,617
Tell me, O Merciful one,
tell me

1344
01:43:29,894 --> 01:43:34,422
Will I have your blessing eventually?

1345
01:44:04,395 --> 01:44:07,831
Brilliant!
Well done! Welll done!

1346
01:44:29,587 --> 01:44:32,784
Hello brother! -
- When? Where? How?

1347
01:44:33,291 --> 01:44:35,657
Slow down.
Too many questions at one go.

1348
01:44:36,661 --> 01:44:38,458
Holy Christ!

1349
01:44:39,297 --> 01:44:41,788
You've got a huge place!

1350
01:44:42,867 --> 01:44:45,335
So, Mr. Disco Dandia,
what's up with you?

1351
01:44:45,836 --> 01:44:48,737
Your Mr. Disco Dandia has
taken to Raybne she dancing now.

1352
01:44:51,075 --> 01:44:53,976
Oh my God! What have you done?

1353
01:44:54,412 --> 01:44:57,313
Which Bengali cleansed
your Bengali pronunciation?

1354
01:44:57,415 --> 01:45:00,384
I'm surely sending Gaby to you. -
- Not a Bengali.

1355
01:45:01,786 --> 01:45:03,845
A Portuguese. -
- What!

1356
01:45:08,593 --> 01:45:10,993
Close your mouth, a fly may get in.

1357
01:45:13,431 --> 01:45:15,092
Can you give me some weed?

1358
01:45:15,566 --> 01:45:20,060
Though after this, a couple of
reefers would've had the same effect.

1359
01:45:20,805 --> 01:45:22,568
Hey, listen...

1360
01:45:22,740 --> 01:45:25,538
I just want to meet Uncle
Reincarnate once, please!

1361
01:45:25,610 --> 01:45:27,009
Please! -
- He is sleeping.

1362
01:45:27,612 --> 01:45:29,273
And he isn't keeping well, too.

1363
01:45:31,282 --> 01:45:31,873
Okay.

1364
01:45:33,084 --> 01:45:35,314
Obviously that happens later then.

1365
01:45:35,853 --> 01:45:38,617
And what's going on with your
music?

1366
01:45:38,789 --> 01:45:41,019
Have you been able
to serenade Maya yet?

1367
01:45:45,930 --> 01:45:47,864
I've got a chance. -
- Okay.

1368
01:45:48,432 --> 01:45:50,992
As in... like a show.

1369
01:45:51,669 --> 01:45:53,899
You know... Radio Mirchi?

1370
01:45:54,338 --> 01:45:57,432
They're doing a concert.
She's the main organizer.

1371
01:45:57,842 --> 01:45:59,309
I've been selected also.

1372
01:45:59,577 --> 01:46:01,704
But there's a hitch. -
- Hitch?

1373
01:46:02,313 --> 01:46:05,714
I lied during the
registration that I have a band.

1374
01:46:06,417 --> 01:46:08,078
Or they wouldn't allow.

1375
01:46:10,755 --> 01:46:12,916
And I don't know
anybody in the band circuit.

1376
01:46:13,991 --> 01:46:16,619
At least if I could
get some musicians... -

1377
01:46:17,528 --> 01:46:19,758
Or leave it to the hands. Right?

1378
01:46:22,933 --> 01:46:23,922
Don't worry.

1379
01:46:24,735 --> 01:46:25,861
We'll arrange something.

1380
01:46:27,338 --> 01:46:28,965
I will take you to someone.

1381
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:31,808
My senior from the
Medical college days here.

1382
01:46:32,009 --> 01:46:33,601
Like a friend.

1383
01:46:34,045 --> 01:46:37,446
I think he'll be able
to guide you well.

1384
01:46:37,882 --> 01:46:38,576
Don't worry.

1385
01:46:38,649 --> 01:46:40,082
The decision has to
be taken today itself.

1386
01:46:40,284 --> 01:46:43,082
Of course. We've to... -
- That's why I came.

1387
01:46:43,354 --> 01:46:45,948
We need to finish this.
Remember everybody.

1388
01:46:46,290 --> 01:46:48,315
Listen to me everyone.

1389
01:46:48,592 --> 01:46:51,288
Let's listen to what he
has to say. Then we speak.

1390
01:46:51,429 --> 01:46:52,794
Here he comes.

1391
01:46:53,297 --> 01:46:54,321
Wait.

1392
01:46:55,566 --> 01:46:57,761
Hello brothers. -
- Listen, you untouchable,

1393
01:46:57,868 --> 01:47:01,827
you've married a Hindu girl
rescuing her from the Sati pyre.

1394
01:47:01,972 --> 01:47:03,701
We've not said anything.

1395
01:47:04,108 --> 01:47:06,474
You've been breaking
all rules.

1396
01:47:06,711 --> 01:47:09,805
Respected people in the village
have lost their caste because of you.

1397
01:47:09,914 --> 01:47:11,609
We didn't say anything.

1398
01:47:11,882 --> 01:47:13,747
But today when we heard... -

1399
01:47:14,952 --> 01:47:18,683
Will you stop listing his
blasphemies and get to the point?

1400
01:47:19,657 --> 01:47:21,056
Fine, I'll get to it.

1401
01:47:22,026 --> 01:47:27,862
Today we heard you're
planning to organize a Durga Puja!

1402
01:47:28,032 --> 01:47:30,432
That's true. -
- Then listen...

1403
01:47:31,902 --> 01:47:33,631
...this Puja will not happen. -
- Why?

1404
01:47:34,505 --> 01:47:38,908
We're staying here, at the outskirts of
the village without bothering anyone. -

1405
01:47:38,976 --> 01:47:39,908
- Shut up!

1406
01:47:40,511 --> 01:47:42,979
We've already told
you this puja won't... -

1407
01:47:47,051 --> 01:47:48,678
Go inside, Mini.

1408
01:47:50,988 --> 01:47:52,421
Go in.

1409
01:47:55,025 --> 01:47:58,461
Listen Antony Sahib, I'll tell
you why this Puja cannot happen.

1410
01:47:58,796 --> 01:48:00,058
You're a Christian by birth.

1411
01:48:00,464 --> 01:48:04,798
Moreover you're poking your nose
into our traditions, our customs,

1412
01:48:05,002 --> 01:48:07,732
even our festivals!

1413
01:48:07,972 --> 01:48:10,770
Even the Viceroy would
not have dared that!

1414
01:48:10,975 --> 01:48:15,002
A crow doesn't turn into a peacock
putting on a peacock's feather.

1415
01:48:15,112 --> 01:48:19,378
And an amateur poet doesn't become a
Bengali by singing a few Kheur songs.

1416
01:48:20,451 --> 01:48:23,113
And Durga Puja?
That's our very own...

1417
01:48:23,754 --> 01:48:25,779
...Bengali festival. Therefore... -

1418
01:48:25,856 --> 01:48:28,916
- Listen brothers, Goddess
Mahamaya herself decides...

1419
01:48:28,993 --> 01:48:31,086
...who is a Bengali and who isn't.

1420
01:48:31,829 --> 01:48:33,820
I am just a humble devotee.

1421
01:48:33,898 --> 01:48:35,923
Worshipping her is my duty.

1422
01:48:36,333 --> 01:48:37,766
I will do that.

1423
01:48:37,902 --> 01:48:41,497
You may do anything you
want to, I don't mind at all.

1424
01:48:43,507 --> 01:48:44,405
Goodbye.

1425
01:48:58,823 --> 01:49:00,484
What I am thinking is...

1426
01:49:01,792 --> 01:49:03,953
...I am a judge at the
same competition...

1427
01:49:04,962 --> 01:49:08,989
Will it be correct if I guide you?

1428
01:49:10,134 --> 01:49:11,965
I don't have any interest in...

1429
01:49:12,169 --> 01:49:14,069
...in competing there.

1430
01:49:14,505 --> 01:49:18,737
I just want to sing this
song for someone there.

1431
01:49:19,677 --> 01:49:22,669
If need be declare an
out of competition... -

1432
01:49:22,746 --> 01:49:25,943
- Just a minute.
Sing it for 'someone' as in?

1433
01:49:31,555 --> 01:49:34,422
The same cardiac case everywhere.

1434
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:36,492
Well well!
Good!

1435
01:49:38,796 --> 01:49:41,924
In that case I'll say that
your song is very nice...

1436
01:49:41,999 --> 01:49:43,125
...I really liked it.

1437
01:49:43,434 --> 01:49:47,336
A unique composition. I got
a very special feeling in it.

1438
01:49:47,471 --> 01:49:50,929
So it's better not to
approach it with a typical...

1439
01:49:51,008 --> 01:49:54,603
...drums, bass guitar,
guitar, keyboard set up.

1440
01:49:54,879 --> 01:49:55,811
So...

1441
01:49:56,747 --> 01:49:57,736
...what do you suggest?

1442
01:49:57,815 --> 01:50:02,479
How you should arrange this song,
how you should present it,

1443
01:50:03,420 --> 01:50:05,718
I think there is only
one person in Kolkata.

1444
01:50:06,924 --> 01:50:09,484
If he agrees to help you,
you're done.

1445
01:50:09,593 --> 01:50:12,118
You'll get a set of musicians and...

1446
01:50:12,363 --> 01:50:15,059
...then if he agrees to
play along, nothing like it.

1447
01:50:15,900 --> 01:50:16,764
Do one thing,

1448
01:50:17,568 --> 01:50:19,468
I'll give him a
call and speak to him.

1449
01:50:20,070 --> 01:50:23,562
Then you can go, meet him.

1450
01:50:23,641 --> 01:50:24,801
Sing him your songs.

1451
01:50:24,942 --> 01:50:26,307
And that's it.

1452
01:50:26,577 --> 01:50:30,104
Thank you Sidhu, I didn't
imagine you'll help us like this.

1453
01:50:30,748 --> 01:50:33,911
Don't be so formal. I've
been in college too, isn't it?

1454
01:50:34,118 --> 01:50:36,882
And in such cardiac cases my
emotion works a little more.

1455
01:50:37,488 --> 01:50:41,049
Rita from NRS and Bodhi
from National college...

1456
01:50:41,358 --> 01:50:44,953
...when they had just begun,
I've contributed a lot in that.

1457
01:50:46,597 --> 01:50:48,064
Fine.

1458
01:50:48,899 --> 01:50:49,991
Who's this person?

1459
01:50:50,067 --> 01:50:52,627
All arrangements
will be made on time.

1460
01:50:52,836 --> 01:50:54,929
Only you won't be there.

1461
01:50:55,105 --> 01:50:58,871
I know, you've become
very famous now.

1462
01:50:59,009 --> 01:51:01,671
You're very busy.
Fine,

1463
01:51:01,845 --> 01:51:03,870
one day when you come back...

1464
01:51:03,948 --> 01:51:05,882
...you'll find my dead body
lying here.

1465
01:51:05,950 --> 01:51:08,646
Then I'll kill myself and lie
down in the grave beside you.

1466
01:51:08,786 --> 01:51:09,753
No.

1467
01:51:09,820 --> 01:51:11,151
That won't happen.

1468
01:51:11,355 --> 01:51:14,620
Why will I be buried
because I married you?

1469
01:51:15,593 --> 01:51:17,788
I will be cremated.

1470
01:51:18,762 --> 01:51:19,990
Will you stop?

1471
01:51:20,297 --> 01:51:23,960
I have duels on all the
three evenings of Durga Puja.

1472
01:51:24,602 --> 01:51:26,433
And on the
last night...

1473
01:51:26,537 --> 01:51:30,064
...I'm competing with
Bhola Moyra, at Sovabajar.

1474
01:51:30,874 --> 01:51:32,102
And that's a duel I...

1475
01:51:32,409 --> 01:51:33,603
...had to fight.

1476
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:39,743
With this the last
chapter of my life began.

1477
01:51:42,886 --> 01:51:43,910
My...

1478
01:51:44,955 --> 01:51:47,583
...last Kabigaan duel.

1479
01:51:48,592 --> 01:51:50,116
Even a birth later...

1480
01:51:51,495 --> 01:51:53,622
...when those incidents...

1481
01:51:54,565 --> 01:51:58,023
...emerge in my mind
just like a film...

1482
01:51:59,069 --> 01:52:00,559
...I...

1483
01:52:02,139 --> 01:52:06,838
When I reached 'Raja' Gopi
Mohan Deb's palace that evening,

1484
01:52:08,145 --> 01:52:09,339
I saw,

1485
01:52:09,913 --> 01:52:11,642
it was a huge affair.

1486
01:52:12,449 --> 01:52:17,284
Bhola Moyra was waiting
therewith his group to attack me.

1487
01:52:18,656 --> 01:52:20,021
We took our seats.

1488
01:52:20,924 --> 01:52:22,687
The competition began.

1489
01:52:23,761 --> 01:52:27,424
As the night fell, the
fight became tougher.

1490
01:52:29,833 --> 01:52:33,462
Both sides got equal appreciation
from the Raja and public...

1491
01:52:33,570 --> 01:52:37,301
...in Bhawani Bishayak,
Sakhisangbad and Viraha.

1492
01:52:37,608 --> 01:52:40,304
So it was obvious that the
judgement would be made in...

1493
01:52:40,544 --> 01:52:42,535
...the Kheur and Lahar rounds.

1494
01:52:42,980 --> 01:52:44,447
Here you are.

1495
01:52:47,718 --> 01:52:51,677
I needed to talk to you,
there's a problem.

1496
01:52:51,755 --> 01:52:55,054
I'll have to reach the venue directly
from the airport on that day.

1497
01:52:55,392 --> 01:52:56,984
No problem.
There will be a car waiting.

1498
01:52:57,061 --> 01:52:58,653
That's very good.

1499
01:52:58,729 --> 01:53:01,061
A nothing thing... the main thing...

1500
01:53:01,131 --> 01:53:03,065
...how's the participation
looking like?

1501
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:06,128
Some very good bands have registered.

1502
01:53:06,336 --> 01:53:08,395
Looks like it'll be a tough fight.

1503
01:53:17,314 --> 01:53:18,611
Come.

1504
01:53:29,793 --> 01:53:35,732
Love engulfs the soul,
Love engulfs the soul

1505
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:43,672
In faraway lands you roam,
I come back to an empty home

1506
01:53:43,741 --> 01:53:50,977
In faraway lands you roam,
I come back to an empty home

1507
01:53:51,315 --> 01:54:01,316
The heart explodes, I worry and fret,
And grapple with my lovesick state

1508
01:54:01,458 --> 01:54:05,588
Love engulfs the soul

1509
01:54:05,796 --> 01:54:12,463
As the mind is on a roll,
Love engulfs the soul

1510
01:54:13,103 --> 01:54:16,698
Love engulfs the soul

1511
01:54:16,874 --> 01:54:20,935
Love engulfs the soul

1512
01:54:30,721 --> 01:54:34,919
Look who's here! Mr. Coward Lee!

1513
01:54:35,092 --> 01:54:38,391
How are you? Still
studying or that's finally over?

1514
01:54:39,596 --> 01:54:41,086
Still going on.

1515
01:54:41,398 --> 01:54:42,422
Nice.

1516
01:54:42,866 --> 01:54:47,030
Still learning Bengali or have you
shifted to Hebrew to impress girls?

1517
01:54:49,306 --> 01:54:50,398
No.

1518
01:54:50,808 --> 01:54:52,867
Still trying my luck at Bengali.

1519
01:54:55,746 --> 01:54:56,906
Maya.

1520
01:54:59,783 --> 01:55:00,909
Even today.

1521
01:55:03,854 --> 01:55:05,685
Where to?

1522
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:10,759
We've come to Sidhu's house.
There's a concert on the 21st.

1523
01:55:11,028 --> 01:55:12,427
I need passes.

1524
01:55:12,996 --> 01:55:17,330
Oh God! Now I'll have to meet you
at Bengali music concerts as well?

1525
01:55:17,935 --> 01:55:19,027
So be it.

1526
01:55:19,269 --> 01:55:21,703
Keep a Bengali to
English dictionary handy.

1527
01:55:27,811 --> 01:55:32,373
Fulfill by experiencing
Krishna within yourself,

1528
01:55:32,683 --> 01:55:36,949
and be sure to avoid his touch

1529
01:55:37,287 --> 01:55:41,690
Lest misfortune befalls
you before your union,

1530
01:55:41,792 --> 01:55:45,785
And you miss him again as much.

1531
01:55:45,929 --> 01:55:49,990
And you miss him again as much.

1532
01:55:50,300 --> 01:55:58,605
O Moon-faced one,
besotted with the Lord

1533
01:55:58,909 --> 01:56:07,715
That your pining end
with devotion, overawed

1534
01:56:08,418 --> 01:56:16,348
Don't worry, O Radha, your
pangs of separation have ceased

1535
01:56:17,261 --> 01:56:25,794
By the prancing flautist now, you
will hence have your heart seized!

1536
01:56:25,869 --> 01:56:29,965
Don't worry, O Radha

1537
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:34,035
Don't worry, O Radha

1538
01:56:34,444 --> 01:56:38,380
Don't worry, O Radha

1539
01:56:42,452 --> 01:56:44,386
What's this crap you smoke!

1540
01:56:46,590 --> 01:56:48,888
Saw dust and wood scrap.

1541
01:56:51,295 --> 01:56:54,458
Smoke something nice
if you have to.

1542
01:56:58,302 --> 01:56:59,735
I still remember...

1543
01:57:00,871 --> 01:57:03,840
...smoking the hookah
with my Grandpa.

1544
01:57:13,650 --> 01:57:14,548
Are you down?

1545
01:57:17,321 --> 01:57:18,788
Tea? -
- No!

1546
01:57:18,956 --> 01:57:21,322
Nothing's wrong with me
and I don't want anything.

1547
01:57:24,394 --> 01:57:28,592
You snap at me exactly
like your father used to.

1548
01:57:30,701 --> 01:57:34,000
Only, you have
better teeth.

1549
01:57:44,581 --> 01:57:46,412
Who's the guy?

1550
01:57:46,583 --> 01:57:48,016
Or is it a girl?

1551
01:57:48,518 --> 01:57:49,678
Mom!

1552
01:57:50,721 --> 01:57:54,418
Why not? Better if it's
a girl, less complicated.

1553
01:57:55,792 --> 01:57:57,589
He used to study
in our university.

1554
01:57:57,828 --> 01:57:58,817
Gujarati fellow.

1555
01:57:59,863 --> 01:58:03,822
I shunned him because he was
a huge nag and very clingy.

1556
01:58:05,369 --> 01:58:07,030
Met him a few days back.

1557
01:58:07,838 --> 01:58:10,830
Looks like he's still the same.

1558
01:58:11,641 --> 01:58:12,938
Still as clingy?

1559
01:58:14,378 --> 01:58:16,642
Hope he does not love you. -
- What!

1560
01:58:16,980 --> 01:58:17,844
Mom, please!

1561
01:58:18,615 --> 01:58:20,674
No, I am just asking.

1562
01:58:21,985 --> 01:58:22,917
Anyway.

1563
01:58:23,553 --> 01:58:27,489
In a few days your concert
will begin. You'll get busy.

1564
01:58:27,657 --> 01:58:29,682
You won't have the time to
think about all this.

1565
01:58:30,327 --> 01:58:32,557
These incorrigible, irritating lads!

1566
01:58:32,629 --> 01:58:33,823
Disgusting!

1567
01:58:43,340 --> 01:58:46,036
Now will you care for a cup of tea?

1568
01:58:49,046 --> 01:58:51,446
It's about to rain.
Come downstairs.

1569
01:59:48,839 --> 01:59:54,141
A misfit schitzo, a hunted torso
And the 'I'-ego

1570
01:59:54,344 --> 01:59:56,369
Let it grow What's the harm in that?

1571
01:59:56,446 --> 02:00:00,041
And a fellatio
Each rumour's ratio

1572
02:00:00,117 --> 02:00:03,985
Rude? You could say so
But am I the only brat?

1573
02:00:06,523 --> 02:00:07,956
What's the harm in that?

1574
02:00:11,428 --> 02:00:16,627
A misfit schitzo, a hunted torso
And the 'I'-ego

1575
02:00:16,733 --> 02:00:18,826
Let it grow What's the harm in that?

1576
02:00:18,902 --> 02:00:22,565
And a fellatio
Each rumour's ratio

1577
02:00:22,639 --> 02:00:26,336
Rude? You could say so
But am I the only brat?

1578
02:00:26,409 --> 02:00:30,038
My well fed cerebellum
Astro chart's ultimatum

1579
02:00:30,313 --> 02:00:33,874
Funeral memorium
Anointing Bengali rock

1580
02:00:33,950 --> 02:00:37,647
Let gambling be abetted
Let me be domesticated

1581
02:00:37,721 --> 02:00:41,316
Pituitary generated
Eroding one's inner block

1582
02:00:43,426 --> 02:00:47,089
If the die is cast,
You're lucky to lose

1583
02:00:47,330 --> 02:00:50,094
Boiled macaroni-dieting blues

1584
02:00:50,333 --> 02:00:54,064
I'am lion at heart
And a Leo by sign

1585
02:00:54,404 --> 02:00:57,805
So I scream and growl
At any given time

1586
02:00:57,908 --> 02:01:01,776
I'am lion at heart
And a Leo by sign

1587
02:01:01,945 --> 02:01:05,381
So, through the amp I roar
At any given time

1588
02:01:05,482 --> 02:01:09,384
I'am lion at heart
And a Leo by sign

1589
02:01:09,586 --> 02:01:13,022
So I scream and growl
At any given time

1590
02:01:13,123 --> 02:01:16,957
I'am lion at heart
And a Leo by sign

1591
02:01:17,027 --> 02:01:20,519
So, through the amp I
roar At any given time

1592
02:01:41,551 --> 02:01:45,544
If the female source of energy
(Shakti), O Shiva, created you

1593
02:01:45,722 --> 02:01:50,318
Then why do you call her
your wife? Why do you?

1594
02:01:50,360 --> 02:01:57,129
Tell me, O Bhola (Lord Shiva), Any
explanation? Do you have a clue?

1595
02:01:57,334 --> 02:02:01,566
If the female source of energy
(Shakti), O Shiva, created you

1596
02:02:01,738 --> 02:02:05,697
Then why do you call her
your wife? Why do you?

1597
02:02:05,875 --> 02:02:12,337
Tell me, O Bhola (Lord Shiva), Any
explanation? Do you have a clue?

1598
02:02:12,716 --> 02:02:18,518
Tell me, O Bhola (Lord Shiva), Any
explanation,? Do you have a clue?

1599
02:02:19,456 --> 02:02:24,553
Don't you know Bhola,
I am your Parvati dear?

1600
02:02:24,794 --> 02:02:31,825
After carrying you in my womb
Now I'm your wife, I hear

1601
02:02:33,637 --> 02:02:38,734
Don't you know Bhola,
I am your Parvati dear?

1602
02:02:38,875 --> 02:02:46,111
After carrying you in my womb
Now I'm your wife, I hear

1603
02:02:47,684 --> 02:02:54,487
During the churning of the ocean
When you consumed the poison

1604
02:02:54,758 --> 02:03:01,322
You cried out my name Said,
'Durga, I seek your protection'.

1605
02:03:01,498 --> 02:03:08,028
You suckled on my breasts
Saved your own endangered life

1606
02:03:08,104 --> 02:03:13,337
I wonder, when was I your mother
And exactly when I became your wife

1607
02:03:13,410 --> 02:03:18,507
I wonder, when was I your mother
And exactly when I became your wife

1608
02:03:19,282 --> 02:03:23,275
If the female source of energy
(Shakti), O Shiva, created you

1609
02:03:23,386 --> 02:03:27,618
Then why do you call her
your wife? Why do you?

1610
02:03:27,691 --> 02:03:34,563
Tell me, O Bhola (Lord Shiva), Any
explanation? Do you have a clue?

1611
02:03:34,831 --> 02:03:41,703
Tell me, O Bhola (Lord Shiva), Any
explanation? Do you have a clue?

1612
02:03:42,672 --> 02:03:46,005
It grapples, struggles
grows and loses fizz

1613
02:03:47,043 --> 02:03:52,003
In my clumsy, unkempt wardrobe
Where my torn jeans gets violent

1614
02:03:52,315 --> 02:03:57,309
In such disdainful implausible times,
will you still remain silent?

1615
02:03:57,420 --> 02:04:02,357
The morning comes, I hate it
Better I sleep and forget it

1616
02:04:02,492 --> 02:04:07,452
Dare you awaken your defiance,
will you ponder in your silence?

1617
02:04:07,664 --> 02:04:10,861
What if the alarm
rings in your coffin?

1618
02:04:14,270 --> 02:04:17,899
It grapples, struggles
grows and loses fizz

1619
02:04:18,274 --> 02:04:25,373
A heathen, an outcaste, a foreigner

1620
02:04:27,317 --> 02:04:30,684
Incorrigible,
can't reform you anymore!

1621
02:04:31,921 --> 02:04:35,288
Incorrigible,
can't reform you anymore!

1622
02:04:36,292 --> 02:04:43,425
A heathen, an outcaste, a foreigner

1623
02:04:44,768 --> 02:04:47,066
Incorrigible,
can't reform you anymore!

1624
02:04:47,303 --> 02:04:48,964
Can't reform you anymore!

1625
02:04:49,038 --> 02:04:51,336
Incorrigible,
can't reform you anymore!

1626
02:04:51,474 --> 02:04:53,305
Can't reform you anymore!

1627
02:04:53,576 --> 02:05:02,075
Let me tell you honestly
O Rotten One, on an evil spree

1628
02:05:02,352 --> 02:05:06,311
Not for you are Gods Krishna, Kali

1629
02:05:06,623 --> 02:05:10,616
Go back to your Jesus
silently

1630
02:05:10,827 --> 02:05:14,729
In the church at Serampore

1631
02:05:14,864 --> 02:05:18,732
In the church at Serampore

1632
02:05:19,302 --> 02:05:23,261
In the church at Serampore

1633
02:05:23,406 --> 02:05:24,896
Well done!
Well done!

1634
02:05:25,275 --> 02:05:28,438
Where's Rupam? -
- He went to Darjeeling for a show.

1635
02:05:28,545 --> 02:05:31,070
Got stuck in a landslide. -
- Now what?

1636
02:05:31,514 --> 02:05:34,039
He won't make it. He
badly wanted to come though.

1637
02:05:34,284 --> 02:05:34,750
Okay.

1638
02:05:34,818 --> 02:05:36,718
But Maya insisted so
he didn't take the risk.

1639
02:05:36,886 --> 02:05:38,615
Therefore? -
- Gabu.

1640
02:05:38,688 --> 02:05:41,418
Last minute replacement
on Maya's request.

1641
02:05:41,858 --> 02:05:44,088
Bunch of worthless fools!

1642
02:05:45,862 --> 02:05:46,988
Hey there...

1643
02:05:47,430 --> 02:05:49,660
...the next band is
Pharashdanga Graduate band?

1644
02:05:49,732 --> 02:05:52,963
Who on earth are they now?
Where are they? Look for them!

1645
02:05:53,036 --> 02:05:56,563
The musicians are setting up inside.
But the lead singer... -

1646
02:05:56,673 --> 02:05:57,662
- I'm here.

1647
02:06:00,376 --> 02:06:02,003
Hi. -
- You! You're next!

1648
02:06:02,078 --> 02:06:03,841
For Christ's sake, hurry up!

1649
02:06:04,981 --> 02:06:06,414
What happened?

1650
02:06:06,950 --> 02:06:08,918
Why did you go speechless, sahib?

1651
02:06:09,719 --> 02:06:11,414
Say something?

1652
02:06:12,489 --> 02:06:14,047
Lost your tongue?

1653
02:06:45,021 --> 02:06:53,622
Christ and 'Krishta' (Lord Krishna)
Are hardly different, my friend

1654
02:06:53,763 --> 02:06:58,462
Just difference in the diction
is where all differences end

1655
02:06:58,668 --> 02:07:07,098
Christ and 'Krishta' (Lord Krishna)
Are hardly different, my friend

1656
02:07:07,744 --> 02:07:16,118
Christ and 'Krishta' (Lord Krishna)
Are hardly different, my friend

1657
02:07:16,753 --> 02:07:25,593
My Christian God is the
same as your Hindu Lord

1658
02:07:25,795 --> 02:07:34,726
Getting Krishna's blessings
makes my life worthily spent

1659
02:07:34,904 --> 02:07:43,505
Christ and 'Krishta' (Lord Krishna)
Are hardly different, my friend

1660
02:07:43,846 --> 02:07:52,345
Christ and 'Krishta' (Lord Krishna)
Are hardly different, my friend

1661
02:07:52,889 --> 02:08:01,354
Christ and 'Krishta' (Lord Krishna)
Are hardly different, my friend

1662
02:08:01,864 --> 02:08:10,363
Christ and 'Krishta' (Lord Krishna)
Are hardly different, my friend

1663
02:08:10,974 --> 02:08:19,404
Christ and 'Krishta' (Lord Krishna)
Are hardly different, my friend

1664
02:08:19,549 --> 02:08:22,848
Are hardly different, my friend

1665
02:08:24,053 --> 02:08:27,352
Are hardly different, my friend

1666
02:08:29,759 --> 02:08:32,660
Brilliant!
Salutations!

1667
02:08:32,829 --> 02:08:35,559
Well done!
Brilliant!

1668
02:08:35,798 --> 02:08:39,325
Coming up next to perform,
Pharashdanga Graduate band!

1669
02:08:48,144 --> 02:08:49,338
Thank you.

1670
02:08:50,346 --> 02:08:51,938
Thanks to all of you.

1671
02:08:53,716 --> 02:08:57,345
Wherever I am today,
for that I am...

1672
02:08:57,787 --> 02:08:59,755
...extremely
grateful to a lot of people.

1673
02:09:01,090 --> 02:09:05,356
Among them I want to
specially mention three names.

1674
02:09:05,928 --> 02:09:06,826
One.

1675
02:09:07,096 --> 02:09:09,963
Sidhu. Thank you Sidhu,
thank you so much.

1676
02:09:11,167 --> 02:09:11,861
Two.

1677
02:09:13,069 --> 02:09:18,006
Kabir Suman, without whose
help I wouldn't have reached here.

1678
02:09:19,475 --> 02:09:23,468
He has arranged this song
of mine with a lot of love.

1679
02:09:23,946 --> 02:09:24,970
And three.

1680
02:09:26,115 --> 02:09:29,107
The one who is the
inspiration for this song,

1681
02:09:31,688 --> 02:09:34,885
the one whom I have loved,
who has encouraged me,

1682
02:09:36,025 --> 02:09:37,549
...to dare to come here,

1683
02:09:39,629 --> 02:09:42,029
the one, to whom
this song is dedicated...

1684
02:09:43,332 --> 02:09:44,128
...that name is...

1685
02:09:53,509 --> 02:09:55,773
...the entire family of
Radio Mirchi.

1686
02:10:49,365 --> 02:10:55,600
Who is this 'you' that I behold,
Who holds a mirror in her eyes,

1687
02:10:55,671 --> 02:11:01,610
Why is it that when I caress you,
This 'you' inexplicably cries...

1688
02:11:01,844 --> 02:11:07,976
Who is this 'you' that I behold,
Who holds a mirror in her eyes,

1689
02:11:08,351 --> 02:11:14,153
Why is it that when I caress you,
This 'you' inexplicably cries...

1690
02:12:01,904 --> 02:12:08,070
Birth and re-birth, the cycle goes
on, As your memory echoes in time,

1691
02:12:08,144 --> 02:12:14,447
Like ancient melodies of our
land, In today's tunes they chyme

1692
02:12:14,584 --> 02:12:20,682
Birth and re-birth, the cycle goes
on, As your memory echoes in time,

1693
02:12:20,756 --> 02:12:26,922
Like ancient melodies of our
land, In today's tunes they chyme

1694
02:12:27,063 --> 02:12:33,059
Come and fill up my silence,
With alphabets of sighs

1695
02:12:33,436 --> 02:12:39,636
Why is it that when I caress you,
This 'you' inexplicably cries...

1696
02:12:39,809 --> 02:12:46,009
Who is this 'you' that I behold,
Who holds a mirror in her eyes,

1697
02:12:46,082 --> 02:12:51,850
Why is it that when I caress you,
This 'you' inexplicably cries...

1698
02:13:36,666 --> 02:13:42,662
In some birth I was the poet
Jaidev, and you were Padmavati,

1699
02:13:42,905 --> 02:13:48,810
The forgotten tales of scriptures
which Cry like you incessantly...

1700
02:13:49,312 --> 02:13:55,308
In some birth I was the poet
Jaidev, and you were Padmavati,

1701
02:13:55,584 --> 02:14:01,420
The forgotten tales of scriptures
which Cry like you incessantly...

1702
02:14:01,891 --> 02:14:07,887
And in each teardrop,
I die and am born again

1703
02:14:08,130 --> 02:14:14,035
As recounting tales of many births,
is your silent pain

1704
02:14:14,603 --> 02:14:20,542
And in each teardrop,
I die and am born again

1705
02:14:20,776 --> 02:14:26,681
As recounting tales of many births,
is your silent pain

1706
02:14:27,016 --> 02:14:33,012
You've poured yourself on me before,
Drench me like rain from the skies,

1707
02:14:33,589 --> 02:14:39,289
Why is it that when I caress you,
This 'you' inexplicably cries...

1708
02:14:39,829 --> 02:14:45,995
Who is this 'you' that I behold,
Who holds a mirror in her eyes,

1709
02:14:46,068 --> 02:14:52,371
Why is it that when I caress you,
This 'you' inexplicably cries...

1710
02:14:52,541 --> 02:14:58,571
Who is this 'you' that I behold,
Who holds a mirror in her eyes,

1711
02:14:58,647 --> 02:15:04,950
Why is it that when I caress you,
This 'you' inexplicably cries...

1712
02:15:41,290 --> 02:15:41,984
Yes.

1713
02:15:46,629 --> 02:15:47,561
May I come in?

1714
02:15:50,433 --> 02:15:51,627
Sure.

1715
02:16:11,353 --> 02:16:15,813
You went off key twice and you
missed the beat once as well.

1716
02:16:16,759 --> 02:16:19,785
Though you can always
say it was all...

1717
02:16:19,862 --> 02:16:20,851
...intentional.

1718
02:16:22,598 --> 02:16:23,997
Not only that.

1719
02:16:24,900 --> 02:16:27,391
My pronunciation of
'S' isn't perfect yet.

1720
02:16:28,270 --> 02:16:32,434
My 'R' is still like a non
residential Bengali and maybe...

1721
02:16:33,876 --> 02:16:37,607
...sometimes I say
'O' instead of an 'Aw'.

1722
02:16:38,914 --> 02:16:39,938
I'm sorry.

1723
02:16:40,716 --> 02:16:42,081
Can I get another year?

1724
02:16:42,585 --> 02:16:43,552
Last chance.

1725
02:16:45,588 --> 02:16:48,079
My mother is waiting
outside to meet you.

1726
02:16:49,091 --> 02:16:50,888
A couple of friends are waiting too.

1727
02:16:53,295 --> 02:16:55,058
Should I call them? -
- Yeah... of...

1728
02:16:55,931 --> 02:16:58,593
...of course.
Err... obviously.

1729
02:16:59,435 --> 02:17:02,871
I too have somebody
I want you to meet.

1730
02:17:03,973 --> 02:17:05,099
Just a second.

1731
02:17:16,018 --> 02:17:17,610
Hello, Mr. Kushal...

1732
02:17:18,420 --> 02:17:19,444
Birju?

1733
02:17:20,322 --> 02:17:21,584
How do you have his phone?

1734
02:17:24,126 --> 02:17:27,095
Gave it to you and left?
As in? When?

1735
02:17:27,763 --> 02:17:29,458
Where did he go?

1736
02:17:31,033 --> 02:17:33,763
You don't know?
This is ridiculous!

1737
02:17:33,869 --> 02:17:35,996
The man is unwell.
He just disappeared?

1738
02:17:37,339 --> 02:17:38,931
Don't you have
any responsibility?

1739
02:17:40,509 --> 02:17:44,639
What do you mean? Go look
for him. When did he leave?

1740
02:17:45,414 --> 02:17:47,939
Go look for him outside!
Right now!

1741
02:17:49,451 --> 02:17:50,110
Idiot!

1742
02:18:58,587 --> 02:18:59,519
Mr. Kushal!

1743
02:19:00,122 --> 02:19:01,612
You got me so worried!

1744
02:19:02,891 --> 02:19:04,654
You just left without telling anyone?

1745
02:19:05,494 --> 02:19:06,392
Anyway,

1746
02:19:06,795 --> 02:19:07,921
Mr. Kushal...

1747
02:19:09,365 --> 02:19:11,162
...I want you to
meet someone special.

1748
02:19:12,067 --> 02:19:13,967
I told you about Maya...

1749
02:19:15,037 --> 02:19:16,436
...this is Mahamaya.

1750
02:19:19,475 --> 02:19:22,842
Hello, Mr. Kushal.
Heard a lot...

1751
02:19:24,113 --> 02:19:27,378
Hail O Goddess Mahamaya
Your endless clemency

1752
02:19:27,549 --> 02:19:30,382
Hail O Goddess Mahamaya
Your endless clemency

1753
02:19:30,552 --> 02:19:34,454
Hail O Goddess Mahamaya
Your endless clemency

1754
02:19:34,690 --> 02:19:39,059
Hail O Goddess Mahamaya
Your endless clemency

1755
02:19:39,561 --> 02:19:40,960
Mr. Kushal?

1756
02:19:41,430 --> 02:19:44,365
Hail O Goddess Mahamaya
Your endless clemency

1757
02:19:46,035 --> 02:19:50,028
Hail O Goddess Mahamaya
Your endless clemency

1758
02:19:50,606 --> 02:19:51,903
Mr. Kushal?

1759
02:19:52,341 --> 02:19:53,865
Mr. Kushal, don't do this!

1760
02:19:54,343 --> 02:19:55,742
Please, Mr. Kushal!

1761
02:19:56,979 --> 02:19:58,810
Mr. Kushal, listen to me.

1762
02:19:58,981 --> 02:20:00,778
Mr. Kushal, I'm Rohit.

1763
02:20:00,949 --> 02:20:03,349
Mr. Kushal! -
- Mistake!

1764
02:20:03,619 --> 02:20:05,348
You've come to the wrong bard.

1765
02:20:05,988 --> 02:20:07,387
I am not Kushal.

1766
02:20:08,023 --> 02:20:09,081
I am Antony.

1767
02:20:09,892 --> 02:20:10,984
Antony 'Phiringi'.

1768
02:20:11,160 --> 02:20:14,061
Shit! -
- Antony 'Phiringi'...

1769
02:20:16,298 --> 02:20:18,289
Mr. Kushal, look at me!

1770
02:20:18,367 --> 02:20:19,925
Look at me,
Mr. Kushal.

1771
02:20:20,035 --> 02:20:21,764
You live here.

1772
02:20:22,004 --> 02:20:23,938
You are a librarian in Chadannagore.

1773
02:20:24,473 --> 02:20:28,034
Mr. Kushal, you're a librarian,
you used to stay in Asansol.

1774
02:20:28,610 --> 02:20:30,669
Mr. Kushal, you have
past life memories!

1775
02:20:30,913 --> 02:20:31,675
Mr. Kushal?

1776
02:20:32,081 --> 02:20:33,480
Come on, look at me! -
- Hey!

1777
02:20:34,650 --> 02:20:36,311
Who are you?
Who sent you?

1778
02:20:36,919 --> 02:20:38,318
Who has sent you?

1779
02:20:38,420 --> 02:20:40,115
Come on, tell me!
Who sent you? Hey!

1780
02:20:40,356 --> 02:20:42,586
That worthless village
headman sent you, right?

1781
02:20:42,725 --> 02:20:44,750
Aren't you done yet,
even after killing my Mini?

1782
02:20:44,827 --> 02:20:47,489
You've finished us!
We're homeless now!

1783
02:20:47,763 --> 02:20:50,960
What do you want now?
Tell me or I'll kill you!

1784
02:20:51,934 --> 02:20:53,629
Tell me who has sent you?

1785
02:20:54,069 --> 02:20:55,969
'Raja' Gopi Mohan Deb!

1786
02:20:56,638 --> 02:20:57,935
'Raja' Gopi Mohan Deb!

1787
02:21:01,677 --> 02:21:02,575
'Raja'?

1788
02:21:04,446 --> 02:21:06,346
The Raja sent you?

1789
02:21:07,383 --> 02:21:11,376
You should've told me earlier!
I am so sorry!

1790
02:21:12,020 --> 02:21:14,011
I did not recognize you.

1791
02:21:14,723 --> 02:21:17,453
Oh no!
I am so sorry.

1792
02:21:19,395 --> 02:21:22,296
I've really lost it
after Mini's death.

1793
02:21:23,365 --> 02:21:24,297
Anyway,

1794
02:21:24,767 --> 02:21:26,359
what's gone
is gone.

1795
02:21:27,603 --> 02:21:30,401
But I can't ignore Goddess
Saraswati's blessings, can I?

1796
02:21:30,806 --> 02:21:32,671
There will be death,
there will be old age...

1797
02:21:33,108 --> 02:21:34,973
but work is work.

1798
02:21:36,078 --> 02:21:38,706
I am a bard after all. Isn't it?

1799
02:21:39,615 --> 02:21:42,880
So you've come to invite me?
Who's on the other side?

1800
02:21:44,119 --> 02:21:45,780
Surely Bhola?

1801
02:21:45,854 --> 02:21:49,722
I knew he won't let go.
Horu Thakur's disciple,

1802
02:21:50,325 --> 02:21:52,919
he definitely has an ego! -
- We lost him.

1803
02:21:53,028 --> 02:21:56,054
Can he forget how I beat
him in front of the Raja?

1804
02:21:56,131 --> 02:21:57,996
He must be sitting somewhere,
singing,

1805
02:21:58,434 --> 02:22:01,870
I'm not the Bhola you
pray to, I'm not the creator

1806
02:22:02,004 --> 02:22:05,405
Horu's disciple from the city
I'm the sweetmeat maker,

1807
02:22:06,108 --> 02:22:09,441
He's not the Bhola you
pray to, he's not the creator

1808
02:22:09,578 --> 02:22:16,347
Horu's disciple from the city,
he's the sweetmeat maker,

1809
02:22:48,917 --> 02:22:49,884
Hello.

1810
02:22:50,085 --> 02:22:51,609
Dr. Sengupta?

1811
02:23:15,444 --> 02:23:21,007
I desire not to be immortal,
Have no other wishes too,?

1812
02:23:21,350 --> 02:23:27,016
The only drive of my mortal stint,
Is merely wanting you.

1813
02:23:27,422 --> 02:23:33,292
Moments pass like previous births,
Reincarnating fast,

1814
02:23:33,362 --> 02:23:39,028
Alphabets just fade away,
like The memories from the past.

1815
02:23:39,301 --> 02:23:45,297
Torn pages of scriptures, sighing,
The wind just rustles through,

1816
02:23:45,440 --> 02:23:51,379
The only drive of my mortal stint,
Is merely wanting you.

1817
02:23:57,319 --> 02:24:03,053
Lokhkhinodor's myth dances on a,
Cobra's outstretched hood,

1818
02:24:03,392 --> 02:24:09,331
Our tradition never did
allow For Behula's widowhood.

1819
02:24:09,431 --> 02:24:15,336
The rafts float by, carrying
along The corpses, all the same,

1820
02:24:33,388 --> 02:24:38,951
Have been looking for you for many
days now to tell you just this...

1821
02:24:40,862 --> 02:24:42,659
...sorry Maya,

1822
02:24:43,966 --> 02:24:46,992
I should have stayed back that day.

1823
02:24:52,708 --> 02:24:57,975
I have been born, a myriad times,
Have died before, on your lap,

1824
02:24:58,847 --> 02:25:04,649
Just to see you once more, I
have Embraced this re-birth's trap.

1825
02:25:04,853 --> 02:25:10,758
Time and again, we have come back,
To the Earth, the calling's strong,

1826
02:25:10,826 --> 02:25:16,765
Sometime Gangur, or Kopai,
even, In Kopotakhkho's song.

1827
02:25:16,832 --> 02:25:22,737
Gangur turned into Cauvery,
and Often Mississipi too,

1828
02:25:22,838 --> 02:25:28,504
Rhine and Congo, as rivers wrote
Their music whole life through.

1829
02:25:28,677 --> 02:25:34,707
I will not, I, have never
written Down music ever before,

1830
02:25:34,850 --> 02:25:40,288
Let wanting you reflect, in
folk Songs' unwritten score.

1831
02:25:46,928 --> 02:25:52,628
When I fell in love with you,
A thousand births ago,

1832
02:25:52,834 --> 02:25:58,636
Buddha painted his loneliness?
In the evening glow.

1833
02:25:58,807 --> 02:26:04,677
His kindness had you wander in
Solitude, begging for alms,

1834
02:26:04,846 --> 02:26:10,682
And I yearned for an yearning you,
As I met those outstretched palms.

1835
02:26:10,852 --> 02:26:16,620
On my knees, those times found me,
I am still on my knees,

1836
02:26:16,725 --> 02:26:22,630
Come bewitch with eyes, with palms
Outstretched in dreams, come please.

1837
02:26:22,731 --> 02:26:28,533
Place your lips on my parched lips,
Let's build a barricade new,

1838
02:26:28,737 --> 02:26:34,437
I swear by the Revolt and Love,
I only desire you.

1839
02:26:40,749 --> 02:26:46,449
Enchanted by my dreams, you had,
Taken births endlessly,

1840
02:26:46,788 --> 02:26:52,522
I was your scream, your
desire and Revolution, your fury.

1841
02:26:52,728 --> 02:26:58,428
Whenever pain had touched you,
know That, that touch was my hand,

1842
02:26:58,667 --> 02:27:04,367
I am your man, I am your roots,
I am your motherland.

1843
02:27:04,673 --> 02:27:10,612
Whenever you had borne a child,
It's father was my desire,?

1844
02:27:10,812 --> 02:27:16,409
Lost count of our children
who Have lit our crimson pyre.

1845
02:27:16,651 --> 02:27:22,453
We come back, 'n' we come
again Each time, we go back too,

1846
02:27:22,758 --> 02:27:28,128
Will come again, declare again,
I only desire you.

1847
02:27:28,730 --> 02:27:34,600
We come back, 'n' we come
again Each time, we go back too,

1848
02:27:34,836 --> 02:27:40,331
Will come again, declare again,
I only desire you.
