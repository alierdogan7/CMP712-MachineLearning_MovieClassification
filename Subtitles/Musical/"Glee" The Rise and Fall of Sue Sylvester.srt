<i>So here's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee...

2
00:00:01,713 --> 00:00:04,681
Consider this the opening salvo
of World War Sue.

3
00:00:04,716 --> 00:00:07,650
I'm asking you for your help
to destroy the Glee Club.

4
00:00:07,686 --> 00:00:10,653
I will not stop
until your little Glee Club

5
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:13,656
is annihilated into oblivion.

6
00:00:13,692 --> 00:00:16,659
I swear to sweet holy Satan
I will end you.

7
00:00:16,695 --> 00:00:18,695
<i>And that's what you missed
on Glee.</i>

8
00:00:20,074 --> 00:00:22,307
All right, let's see what

Great job, guys.

48
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:27,266
That was really impressive.

49
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:29,067
Thank you so much.

50
00:02:29,103 --> 00:02:30,803
Okay, now I know you guys
probably still have

51
00:02:30,838 --> 00:02:33,472
vacation brain, but any pointers
would really help us out.

52
00:02:34,508 --> 00:02:36,241
Guys, thoughts?

53
00:02:36,277 --> 00:02:38,010
What is going on with you, guys?

54
00:02:38,045 --> 00:02:39,578
There was a fire at Dalton.

55
00:02:39,613 --> 00:02:41,480
It burned to the ground.

56
00:02:41,515 --> 00:02:44,349
There's nothing left.

57
00:02:44,385 --> 00:02:45,751
Academy's gone.

(school bell ringing)

60
00:02:51,091 --> 00:02:52,724
Thank you, everyone, for coming

61
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,960
to this emergency
Glee Club meeting.

62
00:02:54,995 --> 00:02:58,297
Now, as I'm sure everyone
in this room is aware of by now,

63
00:02:58,332 --> 00:03:00,866
Dalton Academy has burned
to the ground.

64
00:03:00,901 --> 00:03:04,837
Now, I've gathered you all
here today because Blaine, Kurt

65
00:03:04,872 --> 00:03:07,039
and myself have
been talking and...

66
00:03:07,074 --> 00:03:09,174
although just a moment ago,
we could only see

67
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,476
the Warblers as our competition,

68
00:03:11,512 --> 00:03:15,080
now it's time for us to see them
as a friend and ally.

69
00:03:15,115 --> 00:03:16,849
We have made the decision
to make some lemonade

70
00:03:16,884 --> 00:03:19,051
out of these lemons

71
00:03:19,086 --> 00:03:22,354
and join together
as a show choir super group.

72
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:24,156
This is an opportunity
for all of us.

73
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:25,991
We need them just as much
as they need us.

74
00:03:26,026 --> 00:03:27,059
Where's Rachel?

75
00:03:27,094 --> 00:03:28,894
Shouldn't she be here for this?

76
00:03:28,929 --> 00:03:30,495
Uh, she is in New York
on some business,

77
00:03:30,531 --> 00:03:31,897
but she'll be back soon.

78
00:03:31,932 --> 00:03:33,612
But she is totally on board
with this plan.

79
00:03:33,634 --> 00:03:34,900
Well, okay.

80
00:03:34,935 --> 00:03:37,970
(cheering)

81
00:03:42,343 --> 00:03:44,710
Thank you so much, Mr.
Schuester, for your generosity.

82
00:03:44,745 --> 00:03:46,278
It is in times like these that

83
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:48,614
we can find comfort in the
kindness of our friends.

84
00:03:48,649 --> 00:03:50,949
It's gonna be a challenge
for all of us to move forward,

85
00:03:50,985 --> 00:03:52,584
but I know that we can do this.

86
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,520
And I think it's so awesome
that the Warblers' passion

87
00:03:55,556 --> 00:03:57,522
for show choir is
stronger than ever,

88
00:03:57,558 --> 00:03:59,224
'cause we're really
gonna need that strength

89
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,194
and commitment to not only
win sectionals,

90
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:04,596
but to take it all the way
to nationals this year!

91
00:04:04,632 --> 00:04:06,098
Come on, guys!
(cheering)

92
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:09,635
(whoops) Yeah!

93
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,937
I'm sorry,

94
00:04:11,972 --> 00:04:14,092
but the aroma of overly
dry-cleaned polyester uniforms

95
00:04:14,108 --> 00:04:16,074
just wafted into my office

96
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,944
and up my extremely
sensitive nose.

97
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:20,612
And I can see why now.

98
00:04:20,648 --> 00:04:23,582
The Glee Club is hosting
the Lima Gay Men's Chorus.

99
00:04:23,617 --> 00:04:26,418
Oh, no, she didn't!
BLAINE: Sue...

100
00:04:26,453 --> 00:04:27,552
you know very well that
these are the Warblers.

101
00:04:27,588 --> 00:04:28,954
They're at McKinley now.

102
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:29,922
They're part
of the New Directions!

103
00:04:29,957 --> 00:04:32,224
Oh, they most certainly are not.

104
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:34,739
And they're going to take their
freshly scrubbed cherubic faces

105
00:04:34,762 --> 00:04:37,396
and get the hell
out of my school.

106
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:38,597
They're staying, Sue.

107
00:04:38,632 --> 00:04:40,198
I've already cleared it
with the superintendent.

108
00:04:40,234 --> 00:04:43,135
How dare you go over my head!

109
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,771
Well, I will just have
to get it un-cleared

110
00:04:45,806 --> 00:04:48,607
with Senate Majority
Leader Mitch McConnell,

111
00:04:48,642 --> 00:04:51,410
who I met recently
on the Cayman Islands

112
00:04:51,445 --> 00:04:54,179
at a leadership retreat
and turtle hunt.

113
00:04:54,214 --> 00:04:56,014
He's also a priority contact

114
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,517
on my brand-new
cutting-edge Apple Watch.

115
00:05:01,455 --> 00:05:03,188
Now, fly away, Warblers.

116
00:05:03,223 --> 00:05:04,856
Don't listen to her. Stay.

117
00:05:04,892 --> 00:05:06,191
Leave!
Stay!

118
00:05:06,226 --> 00:05:08,460
There's a good chance
we won't be rehearsing today.

119
00:05:08,495 --> 00:05:09,661
Make no mistake, William.

120
00:05:09,697 --> 00:05:11,663
When the final bell tolls,

121
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,031
I will have plucked

122
00:05:13,067 --> 00:05:15,233
every Warbler feather
out of this school.

123
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:18,503
Doomsday has arrived.

124
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:20,305
Bring it, Suzy Q.

125
00:05:20,341 --> 00:05:22,007
Don't call me that.

126
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:23,342
- Suzy Q.
- Stop it.

127
00:05:23,377 --> 00:05:24,377
Suzy Q.

128
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:26,011
What's the Q stand for?

129
00:05:26,046 --> 00:05:28,347
You monster, Coach!

130
00:05:28,382 --> 00:05:30,082
Why wouldn't you let
the Warblers

131
00:05:30,117 --> 00:05:33,051
join the New Directions!?
It's so unfair!

132
00:05:33,087 --> 00:05:35,988
Honey, Becky, I cannot
understand a word you're saying.

133
00:05:36,023 --> 00:05:38,824
I think she's saying it's unfair
that you won't let the Warblers

134
00:05:38,859 --> 00:05:40,826
- join the Glee Club?
- For crying out loud.

135
00:05:40,861 --> 00:05:43,128
The superintendent
said it was okay!

136
00:05:43,163 --> 00:05:45,397
And "The superintendent
said it was okay."

137
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:47,799
Well, the superintendent
may have said it was okay,

138
00:05:47,835 --> 00:05:50,736
but the president pro tem
of the United States Senate,

139
00:05:50,771 --> 00:05:53,005
Orrin G. Hatch,
begs to differ.

140
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,507
Oh, save the drama
for your mama!

141
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:57,642
The Utah Republican
agrees with me

142
00:05:57,678 --> 00:05:59,378
that the Glee Club is stupid

143
00:05:59,413 --> 00:06:01,680
and that the notion that
two rival show choirs

144
00:06:01,715 --> 00:06:03,749
would suddenly just join
forces out of nowhere

145
00:06:03,784 --> 00:06:07,352
is both morally repugnant
and convenient.

146
00:06:07,388 --> 00:06:09,187
I'm not gonna let you
get away with this!

147
00:06:09,223 --> 00:06:10,322
Becky Jackson,

148
00:06:10,357 --> 00:06:12,924
do not stand in my way,

149
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,493
lest I brand you a traitor.

150
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:18,363
I've performed unspeakable acts
of loyalty for you.

151
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,233
She said she's performed
unspeakable acts of loyalty.

152
00:06:21,268 --> 00:06:22,934
Really? Like what?

153
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,104
BECKY:
<i>I shoplifted for you!</i>

154
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,306
<i>I perjured myself
before a grand jury.</i>

155
00:06:28,342 --> 00:06:30,475
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing

156
00:06:30,511 --> 00:06:32,778
but the truth so help you God?
I swear.

157
00:06:32,813 --> 00:06:34,112
I don't even know why,

158
00:06:34,148 --> 00:06:36,581
but hurting kids
with a burned-down school

159
00:06:36,617 --> 00:06:38,183
is my moral limit!

160
00:06:38,218 --> 00:06:40,552
You're evil, Sue Sylvester!

161
00:06:40,587 --> 00:06:42,554
And you're not
my friend anymore.

162
00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:45,123
Becky Jackson, don't you
trundle away from me.

163
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,725
You toddle out of this office,

164
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,760
and you will never come back!
(Becky crying)

165
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,631
You.

166
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,633
You did this.

167
00:06:54,668 --> 00:06:56,635
You turned her against me.

168
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,937
No, she turned on you
all by herself.

169
00:06:58,972 --> 00:07:01,173
Okay.

170
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,447
RACHEL:<i> It's hard to believe</i>
<i>it's only been a year</i>

171
00:07:08,482 --> 00:07:10,982
<i>since I walked the halls
of NYADA, but I feel like</i>

172
00:07:11,018 --> 00:07:12,117
<i>a completely different person.</i>

173
00:07:12,152 --> 00:07:13,552
<i>I used to be just like them...</i>

174
00:07:13,587 --> 00:07:15,554
<i>Naive and eager...

175
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:18,156
<i>as just another stepping stone
on the way to bigger things.</i>

176
00:07:18,192 --> 00:07:19,958
<i>But I'm not that girl anymore.</i>

177
00:07:19,993 --> 00:07:21,860
<i>I've been through the fire
and clawed my way back,</i>

178
00:07:21,895 --> 00:07:23,862
<i>and now I'm here to ask
for a second chance</i>

179
00:07:23,897 --> 00:07:25,397
<i>from the one woman
who can do it.</i>

180
00:07:25,432 --> 00:07:27,566
<i>And you know what?
She might laugh in my face,</i>

181
00:07:27,601 --> 00:07:29,701
<i>and I don't even care, 'cause
I know one thing for sure.</i>

182
00:07:29,736 --> 00:07:31,436
I can do this.

183
00:07:31,472 --> 00:07:33,738
- Rachel Berry?
- Mm-hmm.

184
00:07:33,774 --> 00:07:36,341
Madame Tibideaux is ready
to see you now, briefly.

185
00:07:36,376 --> 00:07:37,376
Okay.

186
00:07:37,411 --> 00:07:38,611
But I wouldn't get my hopes up.

187
00:07:38,645 --> 00:07:40,946
She's been looking
forward to this.

188
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:46,852
(phone rings)

189
00:07:47,888 --> 00:07:50,188
You can go in now.

190
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:57,129
Thank you.

191
00:08:03,203 --> 00:08:04,302
Butt Chin?

192
00:08:04,338 --> 00:08:06,071
I... mean, William.

193
00:08:06,106 --> 00:08:07,205
What are you doing here?

194
00:08:07,241 --> 00:08:09,374
What a wonderful surprise.

195
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:11,843
I'm just as surprised
as you are, Sue.

196
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:12,879
HARRIS:
Actually,

197
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,714
Principal Sylvester, I...

198
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:17,182
hope you'll, uh...

199
00:08:17,217 --> 00:08:20,185
take the formality
of this meeting seriously.

200
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,187
I need to make sure
you understand

201
00:08:22,222 --> 00:08:23,755
what I am telling you today.

202
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,357
And Mr. Schuester
is a witness,

203
00:08:25,392 --> 00:08:27,159
as well as an aggrieved party.

204
00:08:28,896 --> 00:08:30,829
Well, I'm happy to
clear up any confusion.

205
00:08:30,864 --> 00:08:32,597
Something has come
to my attention,

206
00:08:32,633 --> 00:08:35,133
something grave and...

207
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:37,536
almost beyond...

208
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,606
I saw your hurt locker, Sue.

209
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,018
I can't believe my eyes.

210
00:08:53,053 --> 00:08:55,654
Sue Sylvester keeps
the keys to this place?

211
00:08:55,689 --> 00:08:58,423
Now, in executive coaching,
they train us to be

212
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,492
ready for the most
extreme circumstances.

213
00:09:00,527 --> 00:09:03,895
But what I saw next
chilled me to my marrow.

214
00:09:09,002 --> 00:09:10,035
Myron?

215
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:13,038
My own nephew?

216
00:09:13,073 --> 00:09:15,941
He's just an innocent bystander,

217
00:09:15,976 --> 00:09:19,678
a tween genius who...
loves sequins too much.

218
00:09:19,713 --> 00:09:21,079
(bell gongs)

219
00:09:25,219 --> 00:09:27,719
What?

220
00:09:27,754 --> 00:09:31,523
I am all for young love,
but, uh...

221
00:09:31,558 --> 00:09:34,226
but this is wrong, right?

222
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:36,261
I could've overlooked,

223
00:09:36,296 --> 00:09:37,596
oh, so many things,

224
00:09:37,631 --> 00:09:40,899
but what I saw next
left me no other choice.

225
00:09:41,902 --> 00:09:43,902
What's this?

226
00:09:49,243 --> 00:09:50,942
(gasps)

227
00:09:50,978 --> 00:09:52,877
Sweet...

228
00:09:52,913 --> 00:09:54,779
Sue Sylvester?

229
00:09:56,283 --> 00:09:58,783
I don't see how my...

230
00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:01,553
personal forms of
recreation, uh,

231
00:10:01,588 --> 00:10:04,222
have negatively impacted
my job performance.

232
00:10:04,258 --> 00:10:07,359
I inspire people
by stoking my own

233
00:10:07,394 --> 00:10:09,227
embers, if you will.

234
00:10:09,263 --> 00:10:11,429
And I stand by,
and am very proud,

235
00:10:11,465 --> 00:10:14,099
of what good I have
done for this school.

236
00:10:14,134 --> 00:10:16,935
And if I think if you were
to ask any McKinley parent

237
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,370
or student or any reader

238
00:10:18,405 --> 00:10:21,039
of the<i> U.S. News</i>
<i>and World Report...</i>

239
00:10:21,074 --> 00:10:24,075
I take my responsibilities
seriously, Principal Sylvester.

240
00:10:24,111 --> 00:10:26,044
And clearly...

241
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,446
a part of you does as well.

242
00:10:28,482 --> 00:10:30,048
(clears throat) But after I saw

243
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,651
your locker of vendetta
and your...

244
00:10:32,686 --> 00:10:34,653
pornographic spread,

245
00:10:34,688 --> 00:10:36,321
I cannot

246
00:10:36,356 --> 00:10:39,291
allow you near
the students of McKinley.

247
00:10:39,326 --> 00:10:42,260
Or... any other young people,

248
00:10:42,296 --> 00:10:44,095
anywhere, ever.

249
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:46,998
It is with profound regret

250
00:10:47,034 --> 00:10:48,800
that I terminate
your employment.

251
00:10:50,837 --> 00:10:52,804
I'm sorry, wha...?

252
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:55,640
I'm sorry, what
did... you say?

253
00:10:55,676 --> 00:10:57,776
You're fired.

254
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,873
Hello, America,
I'm Geraldo Rivera.

255
00:11:03,908 --> 00:11:06,943
Washington, Jefferson,
Madison, Sylvester.

256
00:11:06,978 --> 00:11:09,679
<i>My guest tonight
is an American treasure...</i>

257
00:11:09,714 --> 00:11:10,980
<i>Or at least, she was.</i>

258
00:11:11,015 --> 00:11:12,448
<i>Champion cheerleading coach.</i>

259
00:11:12,483 --> 00:11:15,351
Sue Sylvester has led a life
chock-full of winning.

260
00:11:15,386 --> 00:11:17,486
Lately, Sue, it seems like

261
00:11:17,522 --> 00:11:19,488
you've been smacked around
by the loser stick.

262
00:11:19,524 --> 00:11:20,524
Is that right?

263
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:23,259
Well, Geraldo, uh,

264
00:11:23,294 --> 00:11:25,962
despite being one of the scions
of American education,

265
00:11:25,997 --> 00:11:28,431
I have recently
lost my position,

266
00:11:28,466 --> 00:11:30,399
my financial security

267
00:11:30,435 --> 00:11:33,469
and my legacy
has been tarnished.

268
00:11:33,504 --> 00:11:35,738
And today, I intend
to set the record straight.

269
00:11:35,773 --> 00:11:37,039
But, Sue, reading your record

270
00:11:37,075 --> 00:11:38,341
of accomplishments,

271
00:11:38,376 --> 00:11:40,443
they seem almost
too good to be true.

272
00:11:40,478 --> 00:11:42,612
And when our fact-checkers
pored through them, Sue,

273
00:11:42,647 --> 00:11:44,847
they found out that
most of them are made up.

274
00:11:44,882 --> 00:11:46,282
I beg your pardon?

275
00:11:46,317 --> 00:11:47,783
Well, for instance, we learned

276
00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:50,252
that you were not born
in the Panama Canal Zone,

277
00:11:50,288 --> 00:11:52,321
you did not fight
in the Falklands War,

278
00:11:52,357 --> 00:11:56,826
you did not play any role in
extracting the dictator Noriega,

279
00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:59,028
nor is there any evidence
whatsoever

280
00:11:59,063 --> 00:12:00,663
that you were ever waterboarded.

281
00:12:00,698 --> 00:12:02,999
Now, Geraldo, I'm gonna
stop you right there.

282
00:12:03,034 --> 00:12:04,700
I waterboarded myself.

283
00:12:04,736 --> 00:12:06,936
You did not direct the TV movie.

284
00:12:06,971 --> 00:12:08,904
<i>The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders,</i>

285
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,707
you don't have
Trinidadian roots,

286
00:12:11,743 --> 00:12:14,343
nor were you ever,
even for the shortest time,

287
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:16,245
the tambourine player
for Wilson Phillips.

288
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,048
I played tambourine
for Wilson Phillips.

289
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,183
Geraldo, I-I'd
like to respond

290
00:12:21,219 --> 00:12:22,385
to some of these allegations.

291
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,020
You've claimed to have

292
00:12:24,055 --> 00:12:25,888
romantic involvements
with Dan Quayle,

293
00:12:25,923 --> 00:12:27,857
Stephen Baldwin, Matt Lauer,

294
00:12:27,892 --> 00:12:29,792
Johnny Cochran, David Boreanaz

295
00:12:29,827 --> 00:12:32,595
and the drummer
from Jimmy Eat World.

296
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,430
All of these men have
categorically denied this.

297
00:12:34,465 --> 00:12:37,366
I dated all of the members
of Jimmy Eat World.

298
00:12:37,402 --> 00:12:40,569
It just begs the question, Sue:
are you a compulsive liar?

299
00:12:40,605 --> 00:12:43,706
I mean, you've publically
and repeatedly claimed,

300
00:12:43,741 --> 00:12:45,474
for example,
that the singer Michael Bolton

301
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,909
is the father of your child.

302
00:12:46,944 --> 00:12:48,544
Well, that is absolutely true.

303
00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:51,480
Sue Sylvester, our producers
have found out otherwise.

304
00:12:51,516 --> 00:12:52,516
Take a look.

305
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:54,617
I've never met Sue Sylvester

306
00:12:54,652 --> 00:12:56,986
or heard of this
"ThunderBolton69."

307
00:12:57,021 --> 00:12:58,854
I only heard about her
when my lawyers

308
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,222
informed me that she had been

309
00:13:00,258 --> 00:13:02,892
going around saying
I had bought her an island

310
00:13:02,927 --> 00:13:04,994
where we had a years-long
torrid affair,

311
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:06,962
and that I was
the father of her child.

312
00:13:06,998 --> 00:13:08,264
I honestly think the woman has

313
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:09,999
some sort of mental illness.

314
00:13:10,034 --> 00:13:11,600
Sue, do you want
to respond to this?

315
00:13:11,636 --> 00:13:12,968
Fine.

316
00:13:13,004 --> 00:13:15,204
I will admit I can't prove

317
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:17,073
that Michael Bolton
is the father of my child.

318
00:13:17,108 --> 00:13:20,576
Let's hear from another
of Sue's alleged lovers

319
00:13:20,611 --> 00:13:22,344
to find out what he has to say.

320
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,347
Look, I don't blame Sue for
falling head over heels for me.

321
00:13:25,383 --> 00:13:26,515
I mean, she's got eyes.

322
00:13:26,551 --> 00:13:29,318
But she mistook a little
grab-ass in a condo

323
00:13:29,353 --> 00:13:30,586
for true love.

324
00:13:30,621 --> 00:13:32,488
That bitch is crazy.

325
00:13:32,523 --> 00:13:33,523
She had me kidnapped!

326
00:13:33,524 --> 00:13:35,491
And then she signed me up

327
00:13:35,526 --> 00:13:37,059
for these dating sites:

328
00:13:37,095 --> 00:13:40,129
Farmers Only,
BlackPeopleMeet.com.

329
00:13:40,164 --> 00:13:43,299
And the only thing
that she put in my profile

330
00:13:43,334 --> 00:13:45,768
was that my boobs were like
elephant ears.

331
00:13:45,803 --> 00:13:47,670
Sue, it just makes me wonder:

332
00:13:47,705 --> 00:13:49,004
are you okay?

333
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,960
Do you have a history
of profound mental illness?

334
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,944
What I have a
history of, Geraldo,

335
00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:56,712
is devoting my entire life

336
00:13:56,748 --> 00:13:58,481
to the students
of McKinley High.

337
00:13:58,516 --> 00:14:00,216
You know, when I graduated
from the Sorbonne,

338
00:14:00,251 --> 00:14:02,017
I was recruited

339
00:14:02,053 --> 00:14:05,221
by every single one of Wall
Street's top investment banks.

340
00:14:05,256 --> 00:14:07,890
Halliburton wanted
me for their COO.

341
00:14:07,925 --> 00:14:11,093
One time, a very drunk
Boris Yeltsin called to tell me

342
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:13,696
that if I wanted Russia,
he would just give it to me.

343
00:14:13,731 --> 00:14:15,364
I could've had wealth

344
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:17,800
and power beyond
my wildest dreams!

345
00:14:17,835 --> 00:14:19,435
But instead, I chose a career

346
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,337
filled with service
and sacrifice

347
00:14:21,372 --> 00:14:23,873
in order to nurture and
enrich the delicate minds

348
00:14:23,908 --> 00:14:25,908
of America's children.

349
00:14:25,943 --> 00:14:29,078
Since day one, they have been
and will continue to be

350
00:14:29,113 --> 00:14:30,579
my number one priority.

351
00:14:30,615 --> 00:14:32,882
Sue, a lot of these things
that you have just mentioned

352
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:34,016
seem like lies to me.

353
00:14:34,051 --> 00:14:36,886
I visited McKinley
High School to talk

354
00:14:36,921 --> 00:14:38,154
to some of these students,

355
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:39,755
and they tell
a much different story.

356
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,657
She slashed the tires

357
00:14:41,692 --> 00:14:44,026
on my wheelchair 17 times.

358
00:14:44,061 --> 00:14:46,929
She swapped out my weave glue
with mayonnaise.

359
00:14:46,964 --> 00:14:49,632
She made a fake elevator
which she trapped us in

360
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:52,067
and then pumped airborne
drugs through the vents

361
00:14:52,103 --> 00:14:54,503
and built a small robot
that forced us to kiss

362
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:56,338
while it watched
and made noises.

363
00:14:56,374 --> 00:14:58,941
She put a live bear in my house.

364
00:14:58,976 --> 00:15:00,776
Sue Sylvester came
all the way to New York City

365
00:15:00,812 --> 00:15:03,212
to see me in my opening night
on Broadway... <i> Funny Girl...</i>

366
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:05,147
Just so that she could
walk out halfway through

367
00:15:05,183 --> 00:15:07,249
and have sex
all over my apartment.

368
00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:08,584
She cut my dreads off.

369
00:15:08,619 --> 00:15:10,085
GERALDO: Why does she hate
the Glee Club so much?

370
00:15:10,121 --> 00:15:11,720
Do you have any explanation?

371
00:15:11,756 --> 00:15:13,789
She's had it out
for the Glee Club

372
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:15,191
from the very beginning.

373
00:15:15,226 --> 00:15:16,525
Before we were around,

374
00:15:16,561 --> 00:15:17,726
the Cheerios! Were the stars
of this school,

375
00:15:17,762 --> 00:15:19,228
and then we showed up,

376
00:15:19,263 --> 00:15:21,497
and she's never forgiven us
for stealing her thunder.

377
00:15:21,532 --> 00:15:23,499
Geraldo Rivera,
this is an outrage!

378
00:15:23,534 --> 00:15:24,800
This is slander!

379
00:15:24,836 --> 00:15:28,337
These are all lies orchestrated
by one Will Schuester!

380
00:15:28,372 --> 00:15:29,471
Judas!

381
00:15:29,507 --> 00:15:31,674
This may come as
a surprise to you, Sue,

382
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:34,543
but it was not Will Schuester
who tipped us off.

383
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:36,345
It was someone else.

384
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,047
It was Becky Jackson.

385
00:15:38,082 --> 00:15:40,783
BECKY:
<i>Who is Becky Jackson?</i>

386
00:15:40,818 --> 00:15:42,418
<i>America's dying to know.</i>

387
00:15:42,453 --> 00:15:44,887
<i>Well, I could tell you
who she is.</i>

388
00:15:44,922 --> 00:15:48,624
<i>She's a poet, a lover
and a dreamer.</i>

389
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:52,194
<i>I know, because
Becky Jackson is me.</i>

390
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,396
Becky always told me stories
about Coach Sylvester,

391
00:15:54,432 --> 00:15:57,766
but that's what I thought
they were: just stories.

392
00:15:57,802 --> 00:16:00,436
I was like, wait, her
secretary's an actual convict?

393
00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:03,138
She pushes kids down the stairs?

394
00:16:03,174 --> 00:16:04,640
And she was my best friend,

395
00:16:04,675 --> 00:16:08,344
and I supported
anything she did.

396
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:10,913
And when Dalton Academy
burned down,

397
00:16:10,948 --> 00:16:14,750
she refused to let gay Blaine

398
00:16:14,785 --> 00:16:17,419
and the Warblers
join in the Glee Club.

399
00:16:17,455 --> 00:16:20,122
And I knew it was time
to blow the whistle.

400
00:16:21,492 --> 00:16:26,428
I am so much happier
now that I am free from Sue,

401
00:16:26,464 --> 00:16:29,198
and I got a hot boyfriend.

402
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:31,967
He takes me there every time.

403
00:16:32,003 --> 00:16:33,702
And all of those
Cheerios! Out there,

404
00:16:33,738 --> 00:16:36,639
quit being such basic bitches.

405
00:16:36,674 --> 00:16:39,074
Don't let Sue Sylvester
control you.

406
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,877
You deserve better.

407
00:16:42,013 --> 00:16:44,046
(newscast music playing)
We'll be right back.

408
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,979
Get out of my face!

409
00:16:50,014 --> 00:16:51,347
I'm sorry this isn't going

410
00:16:51,382 --> 00:16:52,949
- the way you intended.
- Not really.

411
00:16:52,984 --> 00:16:55,284
Are we rolling?
We're not rolling, are we?

412
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,800
No, no, we're in commercial
right now.

413
00:16:56,821 --> 00:17:00,323
Geraldo, the foundations
of my entire life

414
00:17:00,358 --> 00:17:01,657
have been destroyed.

415
00:17:01,693 --> 00:17:04,126
All I ever wanted
was to be a champion,

416
00:17:04,162 --> 00:17:05,294
and to inspire others

417
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,562
to be champions.

418
00:17:06,598 --> 00:17:08,230
That's why I chose a career
in cheerleading.

419
00:17:08,266 --> 00:17:10,132
Just wanted to succeed

420
00:17:10,168 --> 00:17:12,368
by watching my girls succeed.

421
00:17:12,403 --> 00:17:14,637
Tough world out there, Geraldo.

422
00:17:14,672 --> 00:17:16,339
I wanted them to be tougher.

423
00:17:16,374 --> 00:17:17,873
Smarter.

424
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:20,810
I wish you had interviewed some
of my more successful Cheerios!,

425
00:17:20,845 --> 00:17:23,079
like Quinn Fabray,
currently enrolled at Yale;

426
00:17:23,114 --> 00:17:26,115
Brittany S. Pierce,
math prodigy, M.I.T.

427
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,684
Santana Lopez was
a Broadway understudy

428
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,020
and now could have
a very promising career

429
00:17:31,055 --> 00:17:32,788
as a high-class prostitute.

430
00:17:32,824 --> 00:17:34,957
We did actually
reach out to them.

431
00:17:34,993 --> 00:17:37,026
All three declined to comment.

432
00:17:37,061 --> 00:17:38,728
Wait.

433
00:17:38,763 --> 00:17:39,996
Are the cameras rolling?

434
00:17:40,031 --> 00:17:42,531
Yeah, I lied. I lied.
We didn't go to commercial.

435
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:43,866
The camera's been rolling
the whole time.

436
00:17:43,901 --> 00:17:45,601
Classy, Rivera;
that's very classy.

437
00:17:45,637 --> 00:17:46,902
You know what this is?

438
00:17:46,938 --> 00:17:48,404
This is
a character assassination.

439
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:50,272
This interview is a hack job

440
00:17:50,308 --> 00:17:52,208
unworthy of the name Fox News,

441
00:17:52,243 --> 00:17:54,110
a global brand known worldwide

442
00:17:54,145 --> 00:17:56,579
for being fair and balanced.

443
00:17:56,614 --> 00:17:57,880
And it's unworthy of you,
my friend.

444
00:17:57,915 --> 00:17:59,815
I agreed to sit down with you

445
00:17:59,851 --> 00:18:01,717
because you're a titan
of American television,

446
00:18:01,753 --> 00:18:04,587
known for weird,
shirtless selfies,

447
00:18:04,622 --> 00:18:06,822
getting chaired in the face
by a white supremacist,

448
00:18:06,858 --> 00:18:11,060
and not finding anything
whatsoever in Al Capone's vault.

449
00:18:11,095 --> 00:18:13,896
When I took the reins
at McKinley High,

450
00:18:13,931 --> 00:18:16,699
it was a cesspool of hate.

451
00:18:16,734 --> 00:18:18,968
And it was my vigilance
and tough love

452
00:18:19,003 --> 00:18:21,437
that turned that place
into a no-bully zone

453
00:18:21,472 --> 00:18:24,273
where the most vulnerable
were protected.

454
00:18:24,308 --> 00:18:25,908
Well, Sue, we have an interview

455
00:18:25,943 --> 00:18:28,744
with, uh, someone who does agree
with your assessment,

456
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,413
your position.

457
00:18:30,448 --> 00:18:33,282
We are choosing to protect
their identity though...

458
00:18:33,317 --> 00:18:35,284
The voice has been altered.

459
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,752
Take a look.

460
00:18:36,788 --> 00:18:38,621
(deep distorted voice): I'll say
it till the cows come home:

461
00:18:38,656 --> 00:18:39,955
Sue Sylvester saved my life.

462
00:18:39,991 --> 00:18:43,225
I was in an abusive marriage

463
00:18:43,261 --> 00:18:45,695
to a man they call Cooter
the football recruiter,

464
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,297
and Sue supported me
leaving him.

465
00:18:48,332 --> 00:18:50,933
Also, when I chose
to transition,

466
00:18:50,968 --> 00:18:53,736
Sue supported that, too.

467
00:18:53,771 --> 00:18:55,971
Hey, wait,
why are the lights off?

468
00:18:58,142 --> 00:19:00,843
(deep distorted voice): I'm not
trying to hide my identity.

469
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:02,978
I'm proud to stand up
for Sue Sylvester.

470
00:19:05,216 --> 00:19:07,550
I am as I am, Geraldo Rivera.

471
00:19:07,585 --> 00:19:09,752
And I refuse to apologize to you

472
00:19:09,787 --> 00:19:12,121
or anybody else.

473
00:19:12,156 --> 00:19:14,790
Am I a tough customer?
You bet your bottom dollar I am.

474
00:19:14,826 --> 00:19:16,392
But that's the way I was raised.

475
00:19:16,427 --> 00:19:19,161
As you may or may not know,
my parents were Nazi hunters.

476
00:19:19,197 --> 00:19:20,796
And the lies continue.

477
00:19:20,832 --> 00:19:24,633
No, we weren't Nazi hunters.

478
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:27,169
Her father and I
just told her that

479
00:19:27,205 --> 00:19:29,772
so it would give us a good
excuse not to be around her.

480
00:19:29,807 --> 00:19:32,108
Little Susan was a biter.

481
00:19:32,143 --> 00:19:33,476
She was nasty

482
00:19:33,511 --> 00:19:34,944
from the day she was born.

483
00:19:34,979 --> 00:19:37,413
She even bit my lip
on her way out.

484
00:19:37,448 --> 00:19:38,848
It was weird.

485
00:19:38,883 --> 00:19:41,684
What kind of a newborn
has a full set of teeth?

486
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:43,853
What can I say?

487
00:19:43,888 --> 00:19:47,256
From the minute
I laid eyes on her,

488
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:50,626
I knew that Susan
would always be

489
00:19:50,661 --> 00:19:53,929
the daughter that
I just couldn't love.

490
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:58,067
"The daughter that I
just couldn't love."

491
00:19:58,102 --> 00:19:59,702
That must be hard to hear.

492
00:19:59,737 --> 00:20:02,838
"The daughter that
I just couldn't love."

493
00:20:07,645 --> 00:20:11,213
♪ ♪

494
00:20:24,328 --> 00:20:27,229
So who is Sue Sylvester?

495
00:20:27,265 --> 00:20:28,631
Really?

496
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,333
Is she a lying,
vindictive psychopath?

497
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:32,768
Is she a career criminal

498
00:20:32,804 --> 00:20:34,870
who has endangered the lives
of countless children

499
00:20:34,906 --> 00:20:37,339
and actually deserves
to be behind bars?

500
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:40,810
For the final word, let's go
to one of Sue's coworkers

501
00:20:40,845 --> 00:20:43,579
and show choir director
William Schuester.

502
00:20:43,614 --> 00:20:47,483
Until next time,
I'm Geraldo Rivera reporting.

503
00:20:48,553 --> 00:20:50,686
Have I had my problems with Sue?

504
00:20:50,721 --> 00:20:52,321
(laughs)

505
00:20:52,356 --> 00:20:54,256
You bet.

506
00:20:54,292 --> 00:20:57,960
She has made my life miserable
for as long as I can remember.

507
00:20:57,995 --> 00:20:59,461
(sighs)

508
00:20:59,497 --> 00:21:01,530
But that's because
she's a fighter

509
00:21:01,566 --> 00:21:04,166
and someone who refuses
to betray her own values.

510
00:21:04,202 --> 00:21:06,569
And I'd be lying if I said
her cutthroat spirit

511
00:21:06,604 --> 00:21:08,971
didn't keep everyone around here
on their toes,

512
00:21:09,006 --> 00:21:12,208
striving to work harder
and be better.

513
00:21:12,243 --> 00:21:13,509
Oh, don't get me wrong.

514
00:21:13,544 --> 00:21:15,744
She is not a nice person.

515
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:19,415
But the fact is
she's an outstanding teacher

516
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:22,251
and a born leader...

517
00:21:22,286 --> 00:21:25,788
and McKinley High is
a worse place without her.

518
00:21:25,823 --> 00:21:27,923
She deserves a second chance,

519
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:29,919
and that's exactly what
I told the superintendent.

520
00:21:29,927 --> 00:21:31,927
(laughs softly)

521
00:21:33,598 --> 00:21:36,232
I'm going to bat for you, Sue.

522
00:21:36,267 --> 00:21:38,267
(dark, dramatic music playing)

523
00:21:57,588 --> 00:21:59,755
Okay, that's enough, thank you.

524
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,057
Thank you for being the
soundtrack for my melancholia.

525
00:22:04,462 --> 00:22:06,128
Hello, "Mother."

526
00:22:06,163 --> 00:22:08,797
Hello, Susan.

527
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,966
Thank you for
agreeing to meet me.

528
00:22:11,002 --> 00:22:13,135
I know this must be
difficult for you.

529
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:17,072
"Difficult" doesn't begin
to describe it, Mother.

530
00:22:17,108 --> 00:22:19,508
You've been lying
to me for years.

531
00:22:19,543 --> 00:22:21,510
Susan, does it really matter

532
00:22:21,545 --> 00:22:23,178
that your father
and I were working

533
00:22:23,214 --> 00:22:26,849
in the accounts receivable
department at Ma Bell

534
00:22:26,884 --> 00:22:30,085
while you thought we were
out chasing Nazis? (Laughs)

535
00:22:30,121 --> 00:22:32,655
That's not the lie
I'm talking about.

536
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:33,690
You never loved me.

537
00:22:33,724 --> 00:22:36,125
No, technically,
that's not a lie,

538
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,494
because I never really told you
that I did love you.

539
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:41,497
You know, it would be very
easy to be angry at you.

540
00:22:41,532 --> 00:22:43,832
But I've just spent
the last few days

541
00:22:43,868 --> 00:22:45,834
at the Greater Columbus
Convention Center

542
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,837
attending Oprah's "The Life
You Want Weekend" weekend.

543
00:22:48,873 --> 00:22:50,506
And there I learned

544
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:53,208
that relationships
are a two-way street.

545
00:22:53,244 --> 00:22:56,211
I realize I wasn't
the easiest kid.

546
00:22:56,247 --> 00:22:59,081
My earliest memories are of
trying to light you on fire.

547
00:23:00,351 --> 00:23:03,319
I want to apologize for
all the booby traps.

548
00:23:03,354 --> 00:23:04,553
And the biting.

549
00:23:04,588 --> 00:23:08,090
Oh, Susan, your father
and I really did love you.

550
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,759
We just had an odd way of
showing it, that's all.

551
00:23:10,795 --> 00:23:14,096
We never did get the hang
of that parenting thing.

552
00:23:14,131 --> 00:23:18,067
I always wanted you to
do what I wanted to do,

553
00:23:18,102 --> 00:23:21,737
but you wouldn't have
anything to do with it.

554
00:23:21,772 --> 00:23:25,274
Oh, I remember how much I loved
those old movie musicals,

555
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:28,077
and you couldn't stand them.

556
00:23:28,112 --> 00:23:29,745
Every time I took
you to a matinee,

557
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,915
you'd start crying and
screaming and biting

558
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,751
and trying to set me on fire.

559
00:23:35,786 --> 00:23:38,554
Five minutes in, I realized
I had to take you home.

560
00:23:38,589 --> 00:23:40,422
Mother, I'm sorry,
but sitting through a musical

561
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:41,890
is torture for me.

562
00:23:41,926 --> 00:23:43,892
How do people
just burst into song?

563
00:23:43,928 --> 00:23:45,894
How does everybody
just magically know the lyrics?

564
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,062
I'm sorry.

565
00:23:47,098 --> 00:23:48,297
Don't apologize.

566
00:23:48,332 --> 00:23:51,033
I'm the one who should
be saying I'm sorry.

567
00:23:51,068 --> 00:23:54,036
I'm sorry I never was the
mother I should have been.

568
00:23:54,071 --> 00:23:56,038
I'm sorry I lied to you.

569
00:23:56,073 --> 00:23:58,807
I'm sorry I missed
out on your life.

570
00:23:58,843 --> 00:24:01,543
It's okay to be
angry, sweetheart.

571
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:04,213
You're going to be angry
for quite a while.

572
00:24:04,248 --> 00:24:07,549
I just hope that someday
you and I can sit down,

573
00:24:07,585 --> 00:24:11,253
have a cup of coffee
or something,

574
00:24:11,288 --> 00:24:14,156
if not as mother
and daughter, then...

575
00:24:14,191 --> 00:24:16,158
just as friends.

576
00:24:16,193 --> 00:24:17,826
I would like that.
Hold on.

577
00:24:17,862 --> 00:24:19,028
I have a question for you.

578
00:24:19,063 --> 00:24:21,163
What?

579
00:24:21,198 --> 00:24:22,831
Were you and Dad ever in love?

580
00:24:22,867 --> 00:24:25,501
Well, of course we were.

581
00:24:25,536 --> 00:24:27,836
We fell in love
when we first met,

582
00:24:27,872 --> 00:24:29,204
on a trolley.

583
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,707
And you would like to sing
about it, wouldn't you?

584
00:24:31,742 --> 00:24:33,042
Yes.

585
00:24:33,077 --> 00:24:34,610
Then I will sing with you.

586
00:24:34,645 --> 00:24:35,944
Well, you hate musicals.

587
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,813
But I love the sound
of my own voice.

588
00:24:37,848 --> 00:24:38,848
Okay, band nerds.

589
00:24:38,849 --> 00:24:39,982

(laughs):
Oh, oh!

627
00:26:39,136 --> 00:26:40,435
Thank you, Susan.

628
00:26:40,471 --> 00:26:43,438
Okay, let's just make
sure nothing like this

629
00:26:43,474 --> 00:26:44,706
ever happens again.

630
00:26:44,742 --> 00:26:45,908
I promise.

631
00:26:48,526 --> 00:26:50,343
So Carmen Tibideaux
actually told you

632
00:26:50,379 --> 00:26:51,578
to get out of her office?

633
00:26:51,613 --> 00:26:52,979
Look, you're missing
the point, okay?

634
00:26:53,015 --> 00:26:55,415
She said that she could see that
I was humble, that I was sorry,

635
00:26:55,451 --> 00:26:56,750
which means that
I can't give up.

636
00:26:56,785 --> 00:26:58,752
There's still a chance.

637
00:26:58,787 --> 00:27:00,153
Rachel, I think
that you may be reading

638
00:27:00,189 --> 00:27:01,922
- a little too much into this.
- I don't think so.

639
00:27:01,957 --> 00:27:04,424
Yeah, I mean, anyone named Madam
Tibideaux doesn't really seem

640
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,759
like a woman who
changes her mind

641
00:27:05,794 --> 00:27:07,761
or stays in human
form for too long.

642
00:27:07,796 --> 00:27:09,930
I always thought NYADA
was a school for witches.

643
00:27:09,965 --> 00:27:11,431
What I think Sam
is trying to say is

644
00:27:11,467 --> 00:27:12,766
that you're just reaching
a little bit.

645
00:27:12,801 --> 00:27:15,268
If you remember, I got
kicked out of NYADA, too.

646
00:27:15,304 --> 00:27:16,304
Carmen cut me herself.

647
00:27:16,338 --> 00:27:17,471
Like, with a knife

648
00:27:17,506 --> 00:27:18,672
because she wanted your blood
for potions?

649
00:27:18,707 --> 00:27:20,140
No, because she's not a witch.

650
00:27:20,175 --> 00:27:22,075
Look, you guys,
I could see it in her eyes.

651
00:27:22,111 --> 00:27:23,744
She was moved momentarily.

652
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:25,846
And for that moment,
I saw myself back in NYADA,

653
00:27:25,881 --> 00:27:28,315
back on track before my life
got completely derailed.

654
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,750
Which is why I'm writing
her this letter.

655
00:27:29,785 --> 00:27:31,351
And I'm putting all of
my humiliation out there,

656
00:27:31,386 --> 00:27:33,353
all of the bad reviews
and the good reviews,

657
00:27:33,388 --> 00:27:35,288
a-and the good Glee Club
reviews, and she's gonna see it,

658
00:27:35,324 --> 00:27:36,423
she's gonna give me
another chance,

659
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:37,591
and I'm gonna get back in.

660
00:27:37,626 --> 00:27:39,092
Look, we're all

661
00:27:39,128 --> 00:27:40,560
behind you 100 percent

662
00:27:40,596 --> 00:27:42,629
getting your life back on track,
but I think

663
00:27:42,664 --> 00:27:44,397
that you clinging on to NYADA,
(phone vibrates)

664
00:27:44,433 --> 00:27:45,532
I don't think...
Wait a minute.

665
00:27:45,567 --> 00:27:47,200
This-this is
a-a New York number.

666
00:27:47,236 --> 00:27:48,535
I think this could be her.

667
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,270
I have to go t-take this.

668
00:27:50,305 --> 00:27:51,938
Hello, this is Rachel.

669
00:27:51,974 --> 00:27:53,507
Okay, I don't think
this is healthy.

670
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:55,008
Yeah, I don't think
these are even

671
00:27:55,043 --> 00:27:56,343
actual press clippings
about the Glee Club.

672
00:27:56,378 --> 00:27:58,278
These are just from
Jacob Ben Israel's blog.

673
00:27:58,313 --> 00:28:00,313
Guys, I think we should
just be good friends

674
00:28:00,349 --> 00:28:02,069
and support her
about going back to college.

675
00:28:02,084 --> 00:28:03,717
Shh, she's coming.

676
00:28:03,752 --> 00:28:05,218
What is it?
Was it NYADA?

677
00:28:05,254 --> 00:28:08,488
That was the producer
for the Russell Simmons musical

678
00:28:08,524 --> 00:28:09,956
of the audition
that you put me up for.

679
00:28:09,992 --> 00:28:11,958
I-I don't know,
I totally forgot about it,

680
00:28:11,994 --> 00:28:13,660
but... I got it.

681
00:28:13,695 --> 00:28:16,830
A-And they-they want me
to start in, like, a few weeks.

682
00:28:16,865 --> 00:28:18,365
Oh, my God!

683
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,400
Rachel, see,

684
00:28:19,401 --> 00:28:20,700
your life is already
back on track.

685
00:28:20,736 --> 00:28:21,768
I totally forgot about it...

686
00:28:21,804 --> 00:28:22,836
Oh, congratulations.
Thank you.

687
00:28:22,871 --> 00:28:24,504
What about going back to school?

688
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,239
You know what,
maybe you guys are right.

689
00:28:26,275 --> 00:28:29,142
I don't need to be just forcing
this to happen with school.

690
00:28:29,178 --> 00:28:31,144
You know, I don't have
to go to NYADA.

691
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,847
This is really exciting.
I'm gonna go tell Kurt.

692
00:28:37,252 --> 00:28:39,553
And a-five, six, seven, eight.

693
00:28:39,588 --> 00:28:41,221
One, two, three, four,

694
00:28:41,256 --> 00:28:42,889
five, six, seven, eight.

695
00:28:42,925 --> 00:28:44,558
One, two, three, four,

696
00:28:44,593 --> 00:28:46,226
five, six, seven, eight.

697
00:28:46,261 --> 00:28:48,995
(slowing):
One, two, three, four,

698
00:28:49,031 --> 00:28:50,363
five, six, seven...

699
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,698
Come on!

700
00:28:51,733 --> 00:28:53,400
This choreography is about
as rudimentary as it gets.

701
00:28:53,435 --> 00:28:55,802
And you guys aren't even close.

702
00:28:55,838 --> 00:28:57,637
Okay, that-that is enough, guys.

703
00:28:57,673 --> 00:28:59,973
We're a team, and a team is
comprised of people

704
00:29:00,008 --> 00:29:01,741
with individual strengths
and weaknesses.

705
00:29:01,777 --> 00:29:03,710
Are we a team?
Because look at us.

706
00:29:03,745 --> 00:29:06,213
Half of us are wearing uniforms
from a different school.

707
00:29:06,248 --> 00:29:07,547
KURT:
She's right.

708
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:08,648
There is a major disconnect.

709
00:29:08,684 --> 00:29:09,749
We've got to make some changes.

710
00:29:09,785 --> 00:29:12,686
Teams wear uniforms...
Better grab a blazer.

711
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:14,287
You guys would look
great in blazers.

712
00:29:14,323 --> 00:29:15,555
This is McKinley, dude.

713
00:29:15,591 --> 00:29:18,091
Yeah, your sexist empire
doesn't even exist.

714
00:29:18,126 --> 00:29:19,693
Our look is iconic.

715
00:29:19,728 --> 00:29:22,362
Synonymous with
tradition and excellence.

716
00:29:22,397 --> 00:29:26,066
Not to mention,
it elevates anyone who wears it

717
00:29:26,101 --> 00:29:28,168
to sex-symbol status.

718
00:29:28,203 --> 00:29:29,236
Wait, I'll take one.

719
00:29:29,271 --> 00:29:30,904
Women love these.

720
00:29:30,939 --> 00:29:32,405
Do they?

721
00:29:32,441 --> 00:29:33,506
Come on, guys,
we've welcomed you

722
00:29:33,542 --> 00:29:34,662
to our school with open arms.

723
00:29:34,676 --> 00:29:35,742
Semi-open.

724
00:29:35,777 --> 00:29:36,777
You can't expect us

725
00:29:36,778 --> 00:29:38,078
to adopt your uniforms, too.

726
00:29:38,113 --> 00:29:39,753
But, you know,
it would save us the effort

727
00:29:39,781 --> 00:29:41,081
of having to try
and find a new look.

728
00:29:41,116 --> 00:29:43,083
Okay, look, you guys,
we've had a lot of success

729
00:29:43,118 --> 00:29:44,118
with this in the past,

730
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,385
so we'll just give you
our uniforms

731
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,620
to wear during the competition.

732
00:29:46,622 --> 00:29:49,089
Red T-shirts and Converse
are not uniforms.

733
00:29:49,124 --> 00:29:50,223
You have costumes.

734
00:29:50,259 --> 00:29:51,259
WILL:
Guys, enough!

735
00:29:51,293 --> 00:29:53,260
We need to have some
unity here, okay?

736
00:29:55,597 --> 00:29:57,797
Look, you attend McKinley now.

737
00:29:57,833 --> 00:30:01,568
I'm really sorry, guys,
but the blazers need to go.

738
00:30:01,603 --> 00:30:03,937
We are grateful that you've
welcomed us to your school,

739
00:30:03,972 --> 00:30:05,639
and to be performing
with you guys,

740
00:30:05,674 --> 00:30:08,508
but we didn't choose
to come here.

741
00:30:08,543 --> 00:30:10,510
You always talk about
how important Glee Club

742
00:30:10,545 --> 00:30:12,512
and-and McKinley is to you;

743
00:30:12,547 --> 00:30:14,180
well, we felt the same way
about Dalton.

744
00:30:14,216 --> 00:30:16,182
And then we watched it
burn to the ground.

745
00:30:17,986 --> 00:30:19,686
These jackets
aren't just uniforms.

746
00:30:19,721 --> 00:30:21,521
They're a tribute.

747
00:30:21,556 --> 00:30:24,257
A last surviving artifact of a
place that meant so much to us.

748
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,726
It's all that we have left.

749
00:30:26,762 --> 00:30:30,397
You pumpkins got bigger problems
than your costumes.

750
00:30:31,934 --> 00:30:35,068
I just got word that Sue is the
new coach of Vocal Adrenaline.

751
00:30:35,103 --> 00:30:37,938
(piano plays dramatic melody)

752
00:30:39,174 --> 00:30:41,508
So you get fired
from your old job,

753
00:30:41,543 --> 00:30:44,344
and despite hating show choir

754
00:30:44,379 --> 00:30:45,679
and never having
coached it before,

755
00:30:45,714 --> 00:30:47,714
you're our new coach.

756
00:30:47,749 --> 00:30:49,683
Correction.

757
00:30:49,718 --> 00:30:51,785
I<i> may be</i> your new coach.

758
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,988
If I deem you worthy
of crushing the New Directions!

759
00:30:55,023 --> 00:30:56,990
With a national championship

760
00:30:57,025 --> 00:30:59,693
you will be guaranteed
under my tutelage.

761
00:30:59,728 --> 00:31:02,362
And how exactly do we
prove we're worthy?

762
00:31:02,397 --> 00:31:04,864
By surviving the
Barf-tron 200.

763
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,033
- The what?
- The Barf-tron 200...

764
00:31:07,069 --> 00:31:10,537
is a single consecutive
five-hour workout routine

765
00:31:10,572 --> 00:31:12,939
designed to invoke
maximum nausea.

766
00:31:12,975 --> 00:31:15,275
200 box jumps, 200 pull-ups,

767
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,877
200 burpies, 200 wall balls,

768
00:31:17,913 --> 00:31:21,982
200 double-unders,
and 200 consecutive run-throughs

769
00:31:22,017 --> 00:31:24,584
of Frank Stallone's
"Far From Over,"

770
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:27,187
made famous by John Travolta's
triumphant performance

771
00:31:27,222 --> 00:31:28,222
in<i> Staying Alive,</i>

772
00:31:28,223 --> 00:31:31,491

with your bare hands!
That's hard!

if this is how fit you are
at the peak of your physicality!

807
00:33:13,428 --> 00:33:16,062
You should be ashamed
of yourselves!

808
00:33:16,098 --> 00:33:18,164
(rhythmic humming)

00:33:24,372 --> 00:33:26,106

(music ends)

811
00:33:29,644 --> 00:33:31,778
All right, everyone, take five.

812
00:33:31,813 --> 00:33:35,014
And then we're doing it
all over again.

813
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:37,350
Sue Sylvester,

814
00:33:37,385 --> 00:33:39,719
I think I speak
for all of Vocal Adrenaline

815
00:33:39,754 --> 00:33:41,955
when I say we'd be honored

816
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:44,958
to have you as our coach.

817
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:50,792
Sam, good, I need your help;
we have to figure out

818
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:52,294
what to do with this
whole Warbler crisis,

819
00:33:52,329 --> 00:33:53,829
especially now that Sue
is on the attack.

820
00:33:53,864 --> 00:33:55,304
So here, will you
put this jacket on?

821
00:33:55,332 --> 00:33:57,278
Um, I think you're making
a mistake.

822
00:33:57,303 --> 00:33:58,735
With the jacket?
It's just a jacket.

823
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:00,337
Look, we have to commit to this
and just tell our kids

824
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,705
that this is
what we're doing, okay?

825
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,973
The Warbler's school
burned down.

826
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:04,575
If this is gonna give them
a little bit of comfort,

827
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:05,742
then it's the least we could do.

828
00:34:05,778 --> 00:34:07,444
I mean about taking
that part in New York.

829
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,480
What about NYADA?

830
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:10,280
What about NYADA?

831
00:34:10,316 --> 00:34:11,415
Look,

832
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:12,770
Mercedes was right.
It's pathetic,

833
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:14,084
and worse than that,
it's desperate

834
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,619
to cling to the idea
of going back there.

835
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:18,288
(phone vibrating)
It's not pathetic to go back.

836
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:21,525
Hello, this is Rachel.

837
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:40,477
I...

838
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:50,053
That was Carmen Tibideaux.

839
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:52,055
I'm back in NYADA
if I want to be.

840
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:54,372
That's amazing! Oh, my gosh,
I knew, I knew that you could

841
00:34:54,393 --> 00:34:55,559
just do it, I told you.

842
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:56,827
That's what I said.
Did I not say that?

843
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:58,028
I'm not going back there.

844
00:34:58,063 --> 00:34:59,630
What?

845
00:34:59,665 --> 00:35:01,665
Sam, I just want to go back
to New York a winner,

846
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,200
not with my tail
between my legs.

847
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:05,802
And Mercedes is happy for me,
Kurt is happy for me,

848
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:07,671
Blaine's happy for me.
Why can't you be?

849
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:09,139
You're the person

850
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:11,441
who matters the most;
just be happy for me.

851
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:13,644
I'm telling you the truth, okay,
not just what you want to hear.

852
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:16,313
Yet you said that I was destined
to be back in New York.

853
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:17,348
Yeah, but not like this.

854
00:35:17,383 --> 00:35:19,049
Like what?
What's wrong with this?

855
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:20,484
This is what I wanted!

856
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:22,786
No, what you wanted was
a second chance to get it right,

857
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:24,354
and Carmen
just gave that to you, okay?

858
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,822
If you throw all that away,

859
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:29,159
you're gonna be making the same
mistakes all over again.

860
00:35:29,194 --> 00:35:30,994
Look, Rachel, come on, stop.

861
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,195
It's not a mistake.

862
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:34,898
Me going back to my life
and who I was

863
00:35:34,934 --> 00:35:36,733
is not a mistake.

864
00:35:37,937 --> 00:35:39,803
I just think that
in this day and age,

865
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:41,918
it's insane not to get
a college education, you know?

866
00:35:41,941 --> 00:35:43,106
But, Sam, you're not in college.

867
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:44,641
Well, I know,
but I don't want Rachel

868
00:35:44,677 --> 00:35:45,709
to make my mistakes that I...

869
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:47,110
Rachel is a big girl.

870
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:48,679
She's gonna take care of
herself, okay? We just have...

871
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:50,714
(organ playing Europe's
"The Final Countdown")

872
00:35:58,023 --> 00:35:59,556
Oh, my Lord, this is serious.

873
00:36:03,562 --> 00:36:04,761
Sue, what are you doing?

874
00:36:04,797 --> 00:36:06,229
I'm making a statement.

875
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:09,933
You've crossed me
for the last time,

876
00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:11,868
William Schuester.

877
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,338
Do you have any idea
how many times you've said that?

878
00:36:14,373 --> 00:36:16,106
And it still feels good.

879
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:18,542
You betrayed me,

880
00:36:18,577 --> 00:36:21,812
and I am taking it upon myself
to destroy the Glee Club

881
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:25,515
and you once and for all.

882
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:28,619
And I know I've said
that before, too!

883
00:36:28,654 --> 00:36:30,787
Betray you?

884
00:36:30,823 --> 00:36:32,689
Okay, everyone else
betrayed you, Sue.

885
00:36:32,725 --> 00:36:34,325
There were two people
Geraldo interviewed

886
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:36,627
that stood up for you,
and I was one of them.

887
00:36:36,662 --> 00:36:38,629
Silence!

888
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:41,064
Brad?

889
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,967
("The Final Countdown" resumes)

890
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:49,706
Oh, don't even think
that you can out-Europe me, Sue.

891
00:36:49,742 --> 00:36:53,343
I saw them play live at the
Franklin County Fair in 1993.

(cheering stops abruptly)

918
00:39:15,824 --> 00:39:17,623
I mean, it was so weird
to see you and Sue

919
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:19,125
do a fantasy air guitar battle.

920
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,093
Weird and
borderline psychopathic.

921
00:39:21,129 --> 00:39:23,296
I feel so awful
you guys had to see that.

922
00:39:23,331 --> 00:39:24,331
But I'm done.

923
00:39:24,332 --> 00:39:25,464
I...

924
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,400
<i>We</i> are gonna beat Sue
at sectionals.

925
00:39:27,435 --> 00:39:30,136
Well, looks like Sue is
the least of our worries.

926
00:39:30,171 --> 00:39:31,737
I just got cornered by Myron.

927
00:39:31,773 --> 00:39:35,174
Rachel Berry, Uncle Bob just
told me devastating news!

928
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:37,276
The bottom line is
if New Directions doesn't win,

929
00:39:37,312 --> 00:39:39,111
not only will the Glee Club
get the ax,

930
00:39:39,147 --> 00:39:41,587
but all arts and music programs
will be wiped from the school.

931
00:39:41,616 --> 00:39:44,817
But what am I supposed to do
with all my sequin jackets?!

932
00:39:44,853 --> 00:39:46,586
That's impossible;
I'm paying for the Glee Club

933
00:39:46,621 --> 00:39:47,720
out of my own pocket.

934
00:39:47,755 --> 00:39:49,088
That's what I said!

935
00:39:49,123 --> 00:39:50,556
But that's impossible.

936
00:39:50,592 --> 00:39:52,024
Rachel Berry is paying
for the Glee Club

937
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,192
out of her own pocket.

938
00:39:53,228 --> 00:39:55,127
But this goes beyond
what she can afford,

939
00:39:55,163 --> 00:39:57,129
and this is also
about allocation

940
00:39:57,165 --> 00:39:58,865
of facilities and resources.

941
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,567
I mean, that choir room has to
go back to being a computer lab

942
00:40:01,603 --> 00:40:03,035
or at least another classroom.

943
00:40:03,071 --> 00:40:04,270
(shrieks)

944
00:40:04,305 --> 00:40:05,671
I just can't believe it

945
00:40:05,707 --> 00:40:07,240
after everything that
we've been through.

946
00:40:07,275 --> 00:40:08,474
This could be worse.

947
00:40:08,509 --> 00:40:09,842
We've survived
far more difficult things,

948
00:40:09,878 --> 00:40:11,544
not just in Glee Club,
but in life.

949
00:40:14,482 --> 00:40:16,415
You know, screw it.
We've had to fight

950
00:40:16,451 --> 00:40:17,850
for everything
we've earned in our lives,

951
00:40:17,886 --> 00:40:19,686
and this is just the beginning
of a new fight.

952
00:40:20,588 --> 00:40:22,255
I am so proud of you all.

953
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:25,157
And as badly as I want
to save the arts,

954
00:40:25,193 --> 00:40:26,959
my greatest accomplishment

955
00:40:26,995 --> 00:40:29,295
are the people sitting
in front of me right now.

956
00:40:30,765 --> 00:40:32,531
We never give up,
and we never will.

957
00:40:32,567 --> 00:40:34,800
Well, if only we could just
agree on costumes to wear

958
00:40:34,836 --> 00:40:36,602
for the most important
competition of our lives.

959
00:40:36,638 --> 00:40:38,304
That might actually be
one problem

960
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:39,605
that we may have fixed.
