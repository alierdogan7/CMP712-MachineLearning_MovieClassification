(Pigeons cooing)

00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,337
<i>There was a time</i>
<i>when meadow, grove, and stream</i>

3
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:14,005
<i>The earth and every common sight</i>

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,277
<i>To me did seem</i>
<i>Apparell'd in celestial light</i>

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,910
<i>The glory and the freshness of a dream</i>

6
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,140
(Muttering)

00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,446

00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,244
(Tuts ) Child.

10
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,810
Hold that then. Quickly.

(Birdsong)

12
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,926
(Mutters )

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,995
Just hold still.

14
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:12,004
Put your hat on.

15
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,202
(Mutters )

16
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:22,814
It'll last all through the summer.

17
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,088
Run along.

18
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:32,950
Run along.

19
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,090
(Birdsong)

<i>(Alice ) How queer everything is today!</i>

30
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:59,987
<i>I wonder if I've been changed in the night?</i>

31
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:05,621
<i>Let me think. Was I the same</i>
<i>when I got up this morning?</i>

32
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,263
<i>I almost think I can remember</i>
<i>feeling a little different.</i>

33
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:24,449
<i>But if I'm not the same,</i>
<i>the next question is, who in the world am I?</i>

34
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:29,279
<i>Ah, that's the great puzzle!</i>

35
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,323
<i>Who am I?</i>

36
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,027
(Birdsong)

38
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,057

39
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,495
<i>four times five</i>

40
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,795

43
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,470
<i>and four times seven is...</i>

44
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,463
(Handle rattles )

45
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,225
<i>Curiouser and curiouser!</i>

(Sighing)

47
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:33,372
<i>How doth the little crocodile</i>
<i>Improve his shining tail</i>

(Distorted voices )

53
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:21,157
I think the main problem
is how we all get dry.

54
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,524
(Others ) Yes, yes.

55
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:26,759
If you'd all be quiet and listen to me,
I'll soon make you dry enough!

56
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,265
Yes, yes, yes.

57
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,029
- Are you ready?
- Yes, yes.

58
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:33,162
- Here is the driest thing that I know.
- Yes, yes.

59
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:38,267
- Silence all around, please.
- Yes, yes, yes.

60
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:42,974
William the Conqueror,
whose cause was favored by the Pope,

61
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:46,951
was soon submitted to by the English,
who wanted leaders,

62
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:51,718
and were of late much accustomed
to usurpation and conquest.

63
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:56,728
Edwin and Morcar,
the earls of Mercia and Northumbria...

64
00:09:56,796 --> 00:10:00,357
I have never been so bored in my life.

65
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,424
- Yes. Yes, yes.
- Yes, yes.

66
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:03,798
Did you speak?

67
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:06,303
- No, not a word.
- Yes, yes.

68
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,840
- I thought you did.
- Yes, yes, yes.

69
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,741
- I shall proceed.
- Yes, yes.

70
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:17,681
Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia
and Northumbria, soon declared for him...

71
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,240
- Ugh!
- Oh!

72
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:24,312
..and even Stigand,
as the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury,

73
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:30,590
found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling
and offer William the crown.

74
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:35,066
While the country still reeled
under the shock of the conquest,

75
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:39,036
the conqueror followed it
by introducing the feudal system...

76
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:41,835
- (Snoring)
- ..which was hardly a ray of sunshine...

77
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,774
- Agh!
- ..as it drove a coach and horses

78
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:48,610
through the middle of the Anglo-Saxon politic
as it was then.

79
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,171
Hm? Oh.

80
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:53,582
- How are you getting on now, my dear?
- Yes?

81
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:59,592
Oh, in that case, I move that this meeting
adjourn for more energetic measures,

82
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,527
and I think a good thing
would be to have a Caucus-race.

83
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,796
What's a Caucus-race?

84
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,459
Well, best way to explain it...

85
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:11,435
- (Church organ playing)
- ..is for us all to do it, hm?

86
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,495
Come along, come along!

87
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:16,200
- (Church organ playing)
- (Chatter)

88
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:32,747
(Choir singing hymn )

89
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,582
Oh!

90
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,594
This'll never do.

91
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,857
Come on, come on, come on!

92
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,331
Come on! Come on, come on!

93
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:18,001
Come along now, come along!

94
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,005
Off you go, that's it, that's it.

95
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,064
Come on now, come on!

96
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,585
(Shouting)

97
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,296
(Squealing)

98
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,502
(Squeals and grunts )

99
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,616
- All right, the race is over!
- (Groans )

100
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:17,821
(Others ) Who has won? Who has won?

101
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:21,663
Everybody's won,
and everyone must have prizes.

102
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:26,501
Prizes... Prizes... Prizes... Prizes...

103
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,836
Prizes.

104
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,808
Prizes... Prizes...

105
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:34,539
Prizes... Prizes...

106
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,377
Who's to give the prizes?

107
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:40,316
- Why, she will, of course.
- Prizes.

108
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:43,617
- The prizes.
- Prizes. Prizes.

109
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,589
Prizes. Prizes.

110
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:49,425
Prizes. Prizes.

111
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,463
- Prizes. Prizes.
- Prizes.

112
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,857
- Prizes. Prizes.
- Prizes.

113
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:58,031
- Prizes. Prizes.
- Prizes.

114
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,435
- Prizes.
- Prizes.

115
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,406
She must have a prize herself, of course.

116
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:11,541
Well, of course she must. Er...
what else have you got in your pocket, eh?

117
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:16,454
- Only a thimble.
- Oh, let me see.

118
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,854
Oh!

119
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:22,883
I beg your acceptance
of this elegant thimble.

120
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,259
(Muted cheering)

121
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,891
Perhaps you would care
to continue with your story.

122
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,766
You obviously have
your own methods of drying off.

123
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:34,897
I don't see why I should
waste my breath on it any more.

124
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,602
- More story.
- More story.

125
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:41,238
I'll do nothing of the sort.

126
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,645
What a pity he wouldn't stay!

127
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,511
Come along! Come along! We're late.

128
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:50,612
(Birdsong)

129
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,860
(Rabbit) Mary Ann. Mary Ann.

130
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,336
Fetch me my gloves this moment.

131
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,734
(Rustling)

132
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,711
Quickly, quickly.

133
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,613
(Whispering)

134
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,758
(Whispering)

135
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,963
<i>I'm sure I'm not Ada.</i>

136
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:41,268
<i>She's got long ringlets.</i>
<i>My hair doesn't go in ringlets at all.</i>

137
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,099
<i>And I'm sure I can't be Mabel,</i>

138
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:49,375
<i>because I know all sorts of things</i>
<i>and she knows nothing.</i>

139
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,680
<i>Besides, she's she and I'm...</i>

140
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:58,083
<i>Oh dear, how puzzling it all is!</i>

141
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:11,134
<i>How doth the little crocodile</i>
<i>Improve his shining tail</i>

142
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:14,297
<i>And pour the waters of the Nile</i>
<i>On every golden scale!</i>

143
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:17,240
<i>How cheerfully he seems to grin</i>
<i>How neatly spread his claws</i>

144
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,278
<i>And welcome little fishes in</i>
<i>With gently smiling jaws!</i>

145
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,473
<i>(Sighs)</i>

146
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:26,450
<i>I must be Mabel after all.</i>

147
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:30,181
<i>Oh, I'll have to go and live</i>
<i>in that poky little house.</i>

148
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:34,089
<i>(Rabbit) Mary Ann, do you hear me?</i>
<i>Fetch me my gloves and fan.</i>

149
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,628
<i>I'll go round and get in the window.</i>

150
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,631
(Animal groans )

151
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,099
(Whispering)

152
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,539
- <i>Mary Ann.</i>
- (Whispering and squealing)

153
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:54,010
<i>And a barrelful will do to begin with.</i>

154
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,173
- (Whispering)
- <i>A barrelful of what?</i>

155
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:59,843
(Cries, growls and whispers )

156
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:06,287
<i>We must burn the house down.</i>

157
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,849
(<i>V</i>iolin plays scratchily)

158
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,307
(Dog barking)

159

(Barking)

160
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,524
(Barking continues )

161
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:46,487
(Alice gasping)

162
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,805
(Gasping)

163
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,937
<i>Who are you? Who are you?</i>

164
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:05,442
(Tapping)

165

<i>Who are you?</i>

166
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,151
(He sighs )

167
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,527
(Door creaks )

168
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,464
Who are you?

169
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,737
Come on, don't just stand there.

170
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,605
Who are you?

171
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,840
I'm afraid I don't know just at the moment.

172
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,904
I know who I was
when I got up this morning,

173
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:40,418
but I think I've changed
several times since then.

174
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,421
What do you mean by that exactly?

175
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,648
Explain yourself.

176
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,023
Afraid I can't explain myself.

177
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,528
I'm not myself, you see.

178
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:54,157
No, I don't see.

179
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:58,829
Well, I can't put it any more clearly, I'm afraid,
because I don't understand it myself,

180
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,864
and it's very confusing changing size so often.

181
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,503
It's not at all.

182
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:12,481
Well, I imagine you'll feel a bit queer
when you change size, won't you?

183
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,884
- Not a bit.
- Well, it feels very queer to me.

184
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:17,717
Who are you?

185
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,150
I think you ought to tell me who you are first.

186
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,821
Why?

187
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,263
(Stutters ) Come back!

188
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,095
Come...

189
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:35,534
I have something important to say.

190
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,035
Yes?

191
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,617
<i>K</i>eep your temper.

192
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,549
Is that all?

193
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:50,587
No.

194
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,624
(Clock ticking)

195
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,030
So...

196
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:12,133
- you're thinking of changing, are you?
- I'm afraid I am.

197
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,146
You see, I can't remember things I used to

198
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,978
and I can't stay the same size
for more than ten minutes together.

199
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,120
What sort of things?

200
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:26,123
Well, I've tried to say How Doth The Little
Busy Bee, but it came out all different.

201
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,220
<i>V</i>ery well.

202
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,058
Repeat...

203
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,530
You Are Old, Father William.

204
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,394
''You are old, Father William,''
the young man said...

205
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:43,168
- (Clock ticking)
- ''And your hair has become very white;

206
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:48,839
''And yet you incessantly stand on your head--
Do you think at your age it is right?''

207
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,848
- (Clock ticking)
- ''In my youth,'' said the sage,

208
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,350
as he shook his gray locks...

209
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,581
- Um...
- (Clock ticking)

210
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,919
Um...

211
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:02,154
''In my youth,'' said the sage,
as he shook his gray locks,

212
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:05,287
- ''I kept all my limbs very supple''
- (Clock ticking)

213
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,298
''By the use of this ointment--

214
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:16,362
''One shilling a box--
Allow me to sell you a couple?''

215
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,274
- (Clock ticking)
- ''You are old,'' said the youth,

216
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:22,973
''and your jaws are too weak
For anything tougher than...

217
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,539
- ''than suet;
- (Clock ticking)

218
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:33,955
''Do you think I can listen
all day to such stuff?''

219
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:39,155
''Be off or I'll kick you downstairs!''

220
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:42,894
(Snorts ) That's not quite right!

221
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,770
I'm afraid some of the words
seem to have got altered.

222
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:51,138
No! It is wrong from beginning to end.

223
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:55,168
What...what size do you want to be?

224
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,272
I'm not particular as to size.

225
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,977
It's just that one doesn't like
changing so often, you know.

226
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,520
No, I don't know.

227
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:06,990
- Are...are you happy now?
- Well, I'd like to be a little larger.

228
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:11,086
Hm. Seems a very nice size to me.

229
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:15,293
- But I'm not used to it.
- Hm.

230
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:19,997
- (Sighs ) You'll get used to it in time.
- (Clock ticking)

231
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:22,632
- (Hammering on door)
- (Shouting)

232
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,801
- (Shattering)
- (Laughter)

233
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,882
You'll never make them people
hear in there, you see,

234
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:36,887
cos they're...like they're making
too much noise themselves.

235
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:39,685
I mean, you follow what I mean.
You can hear 'em.

236
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,692
How am I to get in, then?

237
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,024
Hm.

238
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:47,862
- Hm!
- (Shouting continues )

239
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,366
(Shattering)

240
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:53,234
Hm!

241
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,296
(Shattering)

242
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,807
Hm.

243
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:01,869
Oh, excuse me. Something seems
to be cropping up in this area over here.

244
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:07,442
An invitation from the Queen
for the Duchess to play croquet.

245
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,453
Oh, let's have a look.

246
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,589
This the one, then, is it?

247
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,250
Mm.

248
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,694
Yes, right, then. Thank you.

249
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,595
- (Grunts )
- (Smash)

250
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:24,465
Just, er...just sink quietly
out of sight for me, will you?

251
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,231
(Shattering and laughter)

252
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:28,238
Yes.

253
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:30,536
- (Dog barks )
- (Shattering)

254
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,803
- Now, then. I'll tell you what I'll do.
- (Shattering)

255
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,747
- (Wild laughter)
- Tell you what I'll do for you.

256
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:41,582
Nothing. How's that?
Any good to you at all? Nothing?

257
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:44,486
I mean, I wouldn't be able to do it
straightaway, I'll say that.

258
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:46,854
I couldn't possibly do it straightaway

259
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,758
cos I got all these things
cropping up I have to deal with.

260
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:52,388
I... Well, you saw just now.

261
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,398
- Something cropped up there.
- (Smash)

262
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:58,197
And I get...the same type of thing
I get cropping up all the time, you see.

263
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,830
So naturally I got my hands full.

264
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:03,272
But if I was to do nothing for you...

265
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:06,276
I can't promise I could,
but if I was to do nothing for you,

266
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:11,475
I'd have to sort of find a time, you see, when
I could squeeze it in, you see what I mean?

267
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:16,214
- I think you're absolutely idiotic.
- Oh. Oh, well.

268
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,916
Maybe I am. Maybe I'm not.

269
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,924
(Raised voices )

270
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,761
- (Water bubbling)
- (Cackling and shushing)

271
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,923
(Baby gurgling)

272
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,365
(Baby gurgling)

273
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:42,840
- (Baby gurgling)
- (Hums tune )

274
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:47,044
- Why does your cat look like that?
- It's a Cheshire cat, that's why.

275
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:48,676
(Chuckles )

276
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:50,721
Pig!

277
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,484
I didn't know
that Cheshire cats looked like that.

278
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:55,321
All of them can and most of them do.

279
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:59,124
- I don't know that any of them do.
- You don't know much and that's a fact.

280
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:00,892
(Gasping and wheezing)

281
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,526
(Snorting)

282
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,593
(Sneezes )

283
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,571
(Baby gurgles )

284
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,904
Oh dear, oh dear.

285
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:13,069
(Grunting and snorting)

286
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:16,807
Oh! Oh! Here we go,
here we go, here we go.

287
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:19,146
- (Sneezes )
- Mind the baby!

288
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:21,082
(Baby cries )

289
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,177
If everybody minded their own business,

290
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:26,884
the world would turn
a great deal faster than it does.

291
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:29,654
That wouldn't be a great advantage.

292
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:33,289
The world turns on its axis every 24 hours.

293
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,923
Oh-ho-ho!

294
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,993
Don't bother me, I never could abide figures.
Could I?

295
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,197
- (He burbles )
- (Baby chuckles )

296
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:45,471
Speak roughly to your little boy
And beat him when he sneezes

297
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,513
He only does it to annoy
Because he knows it teases!

298
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,013
(Baby cries )

299
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:54,108
- (Both) Wow! Wow! Wow!
- (Baby cries )

300
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:58,952
I speak severely to my boy
I beat him when he sneezes

301
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:02,585
For he can thoroughly enjoy
The pepper when he pleases!

302
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:06,358
- (Baby crying)
- (Both chant song)

303
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:08,991
Wow, wow, wow, wow!

304
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,900
(Baby oinks )

305
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,966
(Cook) Yes, yes.

306
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:21,035
I speak severely to my boy
I beat him when he sneezes

307
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:26,550
For he could thoroughly enjoy
The pepper if he pleases!

308
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:30,679
(Cook) Yes, yes, yes.

309
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,848
Here, nurse him for a bit.

310
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,154
(Pig-like squeal)

311
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:47,531
(Piglet squeals)

312
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,433
<i>Which way ought I to go from here?</i>

313
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:57,842
<i>(Whispers) That depends a great deal</i>
<i>on where you want to go to.</i>

314
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:00,248
<i>I don't much care where.</i>

315
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:03,310
<i>(Whispers)</i>
<i>Then it doesn't matter which way you go.</i>

316
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,788
<i>So long as I get somewhere.</i>

317
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:09,486
<i>(Whispers) Oh, you're sure to do that</i>
<i>if you only walk long enough.</i>

318
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:15,997
<i>What sort of people live about here?</i>

319
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:20,731
<i>(Whispers) In that dire</i>ct<i>ion is a Hatter.</i>
<i>and in that dire</i>ct<i>ion lives a March Hare.</i>

320
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,602
<i>(Whispers) They're both mad.</i>

321
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:25,643
<i>But I don't want to go among mad people.</i>

322
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:29,009
<i>(Whispers) Oh, you can't help that.</i>
<i>we're all mad here.</i>

323
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,412
<i>(Whispers) I'm mad.</i> Y<i>ou're mad.</i>

324
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:39,116
<i>(Whispers) By-the-by, what became</i>
<i>of the baby? I'd nearly forgotten to ask.</i>

325
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,217
<i>It turned into a pig.</i>

326
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:44,318
<i>(Whispers) Ha. I thought it would.</i>

327
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,928
<i>(Whispers) Did you say pig, or fig?</i>

328
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,970
<i>I said pig.</i>

329
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:56,798
(Birdsong)

330
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,240
(Bees buzzing)

331
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:19,558
No room.

332
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:20,962
Oh.

333
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:24,058
- No room.
- No room. No room, no room.

334
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:27,070
- There's no...
- No room!

335
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,197
No room. No, no, no room. No room.

336
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:30,901
- No room.
- There's no room.

337
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:34,139
- No room.
- There's no room.

338
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,976
- There's plenty of room.
- Oh. Oh.

339
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:40,176
- Have some wine.
- I don't see any wine.

340
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:43,277
- There isn't any.
- Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it.

341
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:47,017
It wasn't very civil of you
to sit down before you were invited.

342
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:48,821
I thought you did invite me,

343
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,760
and anyway, the table's laid
for a great deal more than three.

344
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,697
Your, um...your...

345
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:57,428
your hair, er...wants cutting.

346
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,936
You shouldn't make personal remarks.
It's very rude.

347
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:05,306
Oh. Why is a raven like a writing-desk,
I wonder.

348
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:08,971
(Alice ) Oh, I'm glad you've begun
asking riddles. I think I can guess that one.

349
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:12,107
Do you mean that
you can find the answer to it?

350
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:14,811
- (Alice ) Exactly.
- Then you should say what you mean.

351
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:18,151
(Alice ) I do. At least, I mean what I say.

352
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:21,249
- It's the same thing, you know.
- It isn't the same thing a bit.

353
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:26,730
You might as well say that I, er...''I see what
I eat'' is the same thing as ''I eat what I see''!

354
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,322
You might just as well say

355
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,096
that ''I like what I get''
is the same thing as ''I get what I like''!

356
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,797
Yes.

357
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:36,204
You might as well say...

358
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:44,346
''I sleep when I breathe''
is the same thing as ''I breathe when I sleep''!

359
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:48,647
- Oh, it is the same thing with you.
- (Chuckles )

360
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,688
(Insects buzz )

361
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,538
(Yawning)

362
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:19,640
- Oh, what day of the month is it?
- I think it's the fourth.

363
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:22,049
Oh! Ha-ha-ha!

364
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,578
Two days wrong! I knew that butter
wouldn't be good for the works.

365
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,023
- (Insect buzzes )
- It was the best butter.

366
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:31,357
Yes, but we must have got
some crumbs in with it or something.

367
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:33,556
I told you not to use the bread-knife.

368
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:37,590
- It was the best butter.
- That's as maybe.

369
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:42,299
What a curious watch! It tells the day
of the month and not what time it is.

370
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:46,434
Of course it does, child.
Does your watch tell you what year it is?

371
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,480
Of course not. That's because
it's the same year for so long together.

372
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:53,176
Exactly! Well, it's just the same
with my watch. Oh!

373
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:59,520
# When Adam and Eve were first deprived
of the golden hand by Heaven...

374
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:02,754
Oh, the Dormouse is falling asleep again.

375
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:06,786
- Have you guessed the riddle yet?
- No, I give up. What is the answer?

376
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:10,164
I haven't the slightest idea.

377
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,169
Nor I.

378
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:14,137
I think you might do
something better with your time

379
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,901
than waste it on riddles that have no answers.

380
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:21,639
If you knew Time as well as I do,
you wouldn't talk about it. It's him.

381
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,044
I don't know what you mean.

382
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:28,051
Of course you don't! I dare say
you've never even spoken to Time!

383
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:30,587
Perhaps not, but I know
I have to beat time when I learn music.

384
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,816
Oh!

385
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:36,454
Oh!

386
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:39,496
Ho-ho-ho-ho! That accounts for it!

387
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,555
He can't stand beating.

388
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:46,366
But if you keep on good terms with Time,
he'll do anything with a clock that you want.

389
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:51,636
For example, supposing it's half past nine in
the morning, you just whisper a hint to Time.

390
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:56,203
Around goes the clock and it's half past one
in the afternoon, time for dinner!

391
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:58,841
I only wish it were.

392
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,943
(Alice ) Yes, it might be rather nice
but then I wouldn't be hungry for it, you know.

393
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:06,719
Not at first, perhaps, but you could keep it
at half past one for as long as you like.

394
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:11,421
- (Alice ) Is that the way you manage?
- Oh, no, no, no, no. We quarreled last March.

395
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:14,988
Just before he went mad, you know.

396
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:18,627
It was at a concert given by the
Queen of Hearts. I had to sing that song.

397
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:23,163
# Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!

398
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:26,574
# How I wonder what you're at! #

399
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:28,373
You're familiar with it, doubtless?

400
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,710
- I've heard something like it.
- Yes, it goes on...

401
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,013
# Up above the world the world you fly...

402
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:37,646
- (Insect buzzes )
- # Like a tea tray in the sky

403
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:42,022
# Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle...

404
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:46,223
Oh, well, I'd hardly finished the first verse

405
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:52,429
when the Queen jumps up and bawls out,
''He's murdering the Time! Off with his head!''

406
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:56,030
- How dreadfully savage!
- Oh, yes, yes, yes!

407
00:32:56,107 --> 00:33:00,976
Ho-ho! And ever since then,
Time won't do a thing for me.

408
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:04,276
It's always six o'clock now.

409
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,544
(Alice ) Is that the reason
why so many tea things are put out here?

410
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:09,085
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

411
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:12,247
It's always...it's always teatime

412
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:17,886
and of course we don't get much time
to wash the things up between whiles.

413
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:21,796
- So you keep moving round, I suppose.
- Oh, we keep...we keep moving round.

414
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:23,731
Yes, yes, yes.

415
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,065
As the things get used up.

416
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,002
What happens
when you get back to the beginning?

417
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:30,836
- Oh!
- Suppose we change the subject.

418
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:34,173
I'm getting dreadfully bored by this.

419
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:37,976
- I vote the young lady tells us a story.
- Oh.

420
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:41,041
- I'm afraid I don't know one.
- Oh.

421
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,314
Then the Dormouse will.

422
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:51,993
I wasn't asleep.
I heard every word you fellows were saying.

423
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:53,587
Tell us a story!

424
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:57,498
You'd better get on with it, otherwise
you'll fall asleep again before you're done.

425
00:33:57,568 --> 00:34:00,128
- (Insects buzz )
- Heh-heh-heh.

426
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:04,470
Once upon a time
there were three little sisters.

427
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,975
Oh, yes.

428
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:11,744
They were named Elsie, Lacie and Tillie...

429
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,340
(Chuckles )

430
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:17,149
..and they lived at the bottom of a well.

431
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,849
- What did they live on?
- Ah.

432
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:22,859
(Insects buzz )

433
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:31,034
- They lived on...treacle.
- They couldn't have done that, you know.

434
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,593
- They'd have been ill.
- Aye, they were.

435
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:35,901
<i>V</i>ery, very ill.

436
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:38,271
But why did they live at the bottom of a well?

437
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:40,606
Oh.

438
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:44,739
- Take some more tea.
- I've had nothing yet, so I can't take more.

439
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:49,344
What you mean is you can't take less.
It's very easy to take more than nothing.

440
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:54,517
- Nobody asked for your opinion.
- Now who's making personal remarks, eh?

441
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:58,494
- (Chuckles )
- (Insects buzz )

442
00:34:58,563 --> 00:34:59,860
Oh.

443
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,157
Why did they live at the bottom of a well?

444
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,433
- It was a treacle well.
- There's no such thing.

445
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:15,378
If you cannot be civil,
you tell the story yourself.

446
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:19,382
I won't interrupt again.
I dare say there may be one.

447
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,509
Oh, indeed!

448
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:25,856
Well...

449
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:31,657
the three little sisters,
they were all learning to draw, you know.

450
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:33,959
What did they draw?

451
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:36,465
(Others ) Treacle.

452
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,764
Oh.

453
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,200
(Insects buzz )

454
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,969
I don't understand.
Where did they draw the treacle from?

455
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:55,246
You draw water from a water well. You draw
treacle from a treacle well, eh, stupid?

456
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,116
But they were in the well.

457
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,317
Well in.

458
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:03,326
(Guffaws )

459
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:06,387
(Chuckles )

460
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,591
(Grunts )

461
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,896
Then they learnt to draw.

462
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:22,638
And they always drew
something beginning with an M.

463
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:25,773
- Why an M?
- Why not?

464
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:28,944
(Insects buzz )

465
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:42,364
Everything beginning with an M...

466
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:45,925
such as mousetraps.

467
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:48,898
Money.

468
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:51,066
Memory.

469
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,235
And muchness.

470
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:59,810
I bet you never saw anything
like the drawing of a muchness.

471
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:03,081
- Really, now you say it, I don't...
- Then you shouldn't talk.

472
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:06,555
- (Insects buzz )
- Oh.

473
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,122
<i>(Whispers) It's the stupidest</i>
<i>tea party I was ever at.</i>

474
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:16,189
(Insect buzzes )

475
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,894
<i>Why are you painting those roses?</i>

476
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:24,134
Why are you painting those roses?

477
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:26,676
What's that? What's that?

478
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:30,703
Will you hold that book steady?
I can't see to paint.

479
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:33,978
- What are you doing it for?
- Doing it for?

480
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:36,212
- Yes.
- Yes.

481
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:39,085
Yes, what am I doing it for?

482
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:41,989
Yes, well, that is the question, isn't it?

483
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:45,961
Ah. You see? It's no good.

484
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,498
It's all a problem of color, you see.

485
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:54,562
The, er...problem of these being colored white
when red was what was asked for.

486
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:57,335
- Who's to know?
- Oh! Oh, yes, that's good.

487
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,069
Ha-ha-ha! Yes, I like that.

488
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:02,806
Ha-ha-ha! Yes, who's to know?
The Queen, that's who.

489
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,212
The Queen doesn't miss a trick.

490
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,376
It doesn't look much like a red rose to me.

491
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:11,046
Oh, well, perhaps you'd like
to have a go at it yourself, then.

492
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,682
Yes, perhaps you'd like to
have a go at it yourself.

493
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:16,886
I think we can do without any help from you,
thank you very much.

494
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,861
- (Drumming)
- Look!

495
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:20,897
(Band plays )

496
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,465
It's the Queen.

497
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:25,399
(Band drowns out speech)

498
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:25,557
(He sobs )

499
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:43,944
Ah, yes. And who's this?

500
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:46,676
- Yes, who is this?
- Or perhaps I shouldn't ask.

501
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,685
(Burbles )

502
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:53,815
Idiot. Absolute idiot.
You've got an absolute idiot for a son.

503
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,018
Yes, but he's tall. He's very tall.

504
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:58,357
Come along, child, speak up.
What's your name?

505
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:01,159
- My name is Alice.
- Ah. Oh.

506
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:05,802
- Er...
- And who are these?

507
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:09,806
- Or perhaps I shouldn't ask.
- How should I know? It's no business of mine.

508
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:11,808
You little hussy. Off with her head.

509
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:13,867
Nonsense.

510
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:15,707
(Men sob)

511
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:20,774
Ah, yes. And what have you been doing here?
Or perhaps I shouldn't ask.

512
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:22,546
Or perhaps I should.

513
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,646
Ha-ha! Painting white roses red, hm?

514
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,918
Perhaps you have an explanation?

515
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:32,520
Well, ma'am,
it's by way of rectifying a mistake.

516
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:37,932
What I've always said is what the eye don't see
the heart don't grieve over.

517
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:41,961
I think that's for me to judge.
Off with their heads.

518
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:46,373
- (Drum roll)
- It's a very fine day.

519
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:49,811
- <i>V</i>ery. Where's the Duchess?
- She's under sentence of execution.

520
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,814
- What for?
- She boxed the Queen's ears. Whoops.

521
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,516
All right!

522
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:56,576
Get to your places!

523
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,552
You heard what she said.

524
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:12,867
(Hymn starts )

525
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:15,024
- (Hymn fades )
- (Birdsong)

526
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:34,538
(Drums beating)

527
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:46,981
(Drums drown out speech)

528
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:54,125
(Chatter and laughter)

529
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:33,570
(Laughter)

530
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,436
<i>(Alice whispers) How are you getting on?</i>

531
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:18,702
I don't think they play at all fairly.

532
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,471
<i>How do you like the Queen?</i>

533
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:22,478
Not at all.

534
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:23,979
(Trumpet fanfare )

535
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:27,881
- Who are you talking to?
- It's a friend of mine.

536
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,612
I don't like the look of it at all.

537
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:33,452
- A cat may look at a queen.
- Cats are allowed to do that.

538
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:35,719
It must be removed. Executioner!

539
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:40,287
About that cat.
I want its head taken off. Right off.

540
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:43,356
Yeah, well, you've got a problem there,
haven't you?

541
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:47,130
I mean, with regard to cutting off a head,
you got a real problem,

542
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:49,604
unless there's a body to cut it off from.

543
00:46:49,673 --> 00:46:51,368
I mean, you see what I mean.

544
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:56,777
Don't talk nonsense.
Anything that has a head can be beheaded.

545
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:58,474
Anyway, who does it belong to?

546
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:01,177
It belongs to the Duchess
and you'd better ask her about it.

547
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:03,845
- Ha-ha.
- Oh.

548
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:16,827
(Birdsong)

549
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:24,607
Oh! You can't think how glad I am to see you,
you dear old thing!

550
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:31,344
You're thinking about something
and that makes you forget to talk.

551
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:35,476
I can't remember the moral of that,
but I shall remember it in a moment.

552
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:37,247
<i>Perhaps it hasn't got a moral.</i>

553
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:43,351
Tut-tut! My dear child, everything's got
a moral, if only you can find it.

554
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:45,588
<i>The game seems to be</i>
<i>coming on much better now.</i>

555
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:48,460
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

556
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:54,266
And the moral of it is...
'tis love, 'tis love makes the world go round.

557
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:56,738
<i>I thought it was done by everybody</i>
<i>minding their own business.</i>

558
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:59,537
Oh! Well, yes.

559
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,238
Well, it means much the same thing.

560
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:03,643
And the moral of that is,

561
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:07,980
take care of the sense
and the sounds will take care of themselves.

562
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,212
<i>Oh, she's jolly fond of finding morals.</i>

563
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:13,256
I dare say you're wondering
why I don't put my arm round your waist.

564
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:18,886
Well, the reason is I'm doubtful
of the temper of your flamingo.

565
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:20,589
<i>I haven't got a flamingo any more.</i>

566
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:25,226
How true, how true!
Flamingos and mustard, both bite.

567
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:30,433
And the moral of that is,
birds of a feather flock together!

568
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:33,032
<i>But mustard isn't a bird.</i>

569
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:38,412
Right as usual. You do have
a nice clear way of putting things.

570
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:40,006
<i>It's a mineral, I think.</i>

571
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:44,782
Yes, of course it is, and there's
a rather large mustard mine quite near here.

572
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:47,255
Ha-ha! And the moral of it is,

573
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:51,158
the more there is of mine,
the less there is of your'n.

574
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:54,425
<i>I know, it's a vegetable.</i>
<i>It doesn't look like one but it is.</i>

575
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:56,193
I quite agree with you.

576
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:59,997
And the moral of that is,
be what you'd seem to be.

577
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:02,334
Or if you would like it put more simply,

578
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:05,534
never imagine yourself not to be otherwise

579
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,577
than what it would appear to others

580
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:12,240
that what you were and
what you might have been is not otherwise...

581
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:14,978
(Chuckles ) ..than what you have been.

582
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:17,987
<i>I think I'd understand that a bit better</i>
<i>if I had it written down,</i>

583
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:20,751
<i>and I'm afraid</i>
<i>I can't quite follow it as you say it.</i>

584
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:25,488
Oh! I could say much better
than that if I chose.

585
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:28,395
<i>Please don't trouble yourself</i>
<i>to say it any longer than that.</i>

586
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:32,561
Don't talk about trouble. I'll make you
a present of everything I've said as yet.

587
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,628
<i>A cheap sort of present, I must say.</i>

588
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:38,504
- Thinking again?
- <i>I have a right to think.</i>

589
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:42,944
About as much right as pigs have to fly.
And the moral...

590
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:45,345
(Applause in distance )

591
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:51,652
Either you or your head must be off
in the next five minutes!

592
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:53,747
Take your choice.

593
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:14,409
She'll be the death of me.
Come on, let's get on with the game.

594
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:20,106
(Funeral march plays )

595
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:33,422
Well, here we are.

596
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:36,864
- What's happened to them?
- They're going to be executed.

597
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:40,460
- What do you mean?
- They're going to have their heads taken off.

598
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:43,995
- What, all of them?
- Yes, the whole lot.

599
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:47,339
There's no point spoiling the ship
for a ha'porth of tar.

600
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:50,403
- Have you seen the Mock Turtle?
- No, who's that?

601
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,314
Hm, you'd better ask the Gryphon about that.
He would be able to let you know.

602
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,352
(Seagulls cry )

603
00:50:58,121 --> 00:51:02,990
That's just her fantasy.
She never executes anyone.

604
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,790
Ah, there he is.

605
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:09,855
- What's he so sad about?
- That's just his fantasy.

606
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:12,800
He's got nothing to be sad about, really.

607
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:26,978
This young lady
wants to hear your life history.

608
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:30,849
All right. I'll tell it to her.

609
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:34,413
But don't speak a word till I finish.

610
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,366
But how can he finish if he doesn't begin?

611
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:55,241
Shh. He's got to get into the mood.

612
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:12,054
When we were little,
we all went to school in the sea.

613
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:17,066
The master was an old turtle -
we used to call him Tortoise...

614
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,568
Why did you call him Tortoise
if he wasn't one?

615
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:23,072
We called him Tortoise because he taught us.
Really, you are very dull.

616
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,337
Ashamed of you asking
such a simple question as that.

617
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:28,639
We had the best of educations.

618
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:31,545
In fact we went to school every day.

619
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:34,379
I've been to a day school too.
It's nothing to be so proud about.

620
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:37,784
- With extras?
- Yes, we learned French and music.

621
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:39,754
And washing?

622
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,688
- Certainly not.
- Aha.

623
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:44,420
Well, then, yours wasn't really a good school.

624
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:52,833
At our school we always had at the end
of the bill, music, French and washing...extra.

625
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:57,971
But I couldn't afford to learn it.
I only took the regular course.

626
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:59,531
What was that?

627
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:01,668
Reeling and writhing, of course, to begin with,

628
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:04,145
and then there were
the different branches of Arithmetic,

629
00:53:04,214 --> 00:53:09,117
Ambition, Distraction,
Uglification and Derision.

630
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,620
I never heard of Uglification before.

631
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:14,486
Never heard of uglify?

632
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:17,618
- You've heard of beautifying, I suppose?
- Yes.

633
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,218
Need I say more?

634
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:23,198
Then there was Mystery, ancient and modern,

635
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:25,393
and then Drawling.

636
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:29,234
That was with the Drawling master.
He used to come once a week.

637
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:33,333
He taught us Drawling, Stretching,

638
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:35,742
and Fainting in Coils.

639
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:37,404
What was that like?

640
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,108
I couldn't possibly show you myself.
I'm much too stiff.

641
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:42,811
And he never learnt it.

642
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:46,378
I hadn't time.
But I went to the Classical master.

643
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:49,323
Mm, I never went to him.

644
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:53,226
He taught Laughing and Grief, or so they said.

645
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:57,328
So he did, so he did.

646
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:10,975
- How many hours a day did you do lessons?
- Ten hours the first day.

647
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:13,208
- Nine the second.
- And so on.

648
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:15,581
- How odd.
- Not odd at all.

649
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:19,520
That's why they're called lessons,
because they lessen from day to day.

650
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:23,117
Then the eleventh day
must have been a holiday.

651
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:24,592
So it was.

652
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:27,755
So it was.

653
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:29,924
But then how did you manage on the 12th day?

654
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,495
Oh, that's enough about lessons.
Tell her about the games.

655
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,403
Have you ever done the Lobster Quadrille?

656
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:42,243
No. What sort of a dance is that?

657
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:45,110
Well, first you form a line along the seashore.

658
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:48,844
No, two lines. Then after you've cleared
the jellyfish out of the way...

659
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:50,715
That generally takes some time.

660
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:53,221
- ..you advance twice.
- Each with a lobster as a partner.

661
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,782
You advance twice, set to partners...

662
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:59,954
Change lobsters and retire in the same order.

663
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:03,491
It must be a very pretty dance.

664
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:07,366
- Would you like to hear some of it?
- <i>V</i>ery much indeed.

665
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:08,768
Well, we'll sing.

666
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:11,568
Oh, you sing it. I can't remember the words.

667
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:18,241
# Will you walk a little faster?
Said the whiting to the snail

668
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:23,184
# There's a porpoise close behind me
And he's treading on my tail

669
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:27,053
# See how eagerly the lobsters
And the turtles all advance!

670
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:30,820
# They are waiting on the shingle
Won't you come and join the dance?

671
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:34,557
# Will you, won't you, will you, won't you
Will you join the dance?

672
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:40,628
# Will you, won't you, will you, won't you
Won't you join the dance?

673
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:46,840
# You can really have no notion
How delightful it will be

674
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:50,937
# When they take us up and throw us
With the lobsters out to sea

675
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,209
# But the snail replied

676
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:55,513
# ''Too far, too far!''

677
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:56,950
# And gave a look askance

678
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:02,151
# Said he thanked the whiting kindly
But he would not join the dance

679
00:56:02,225 --> 00:56:05,683
# Would not, could not, could not, would not
Could not join the dance

680
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:08,322
# Could not, would not...

681
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:10,730
# Could not, would not

682
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,429
# Would not join

683
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:16,335
# The dance #

684
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:26,671
- (Seagulls cry )
- <i>(Whispers) The trial's beginning.</i>

685
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,046
<i>The trial's beginning.</i>

686
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,588
(Hymn begins )

687
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:42,023
(Hymn continues )

688
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:12,554
(Hymn continues )

689
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:51,357
(Cough)

690
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:53,902
(Hymn continues )

691
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:31,873
(Hymn ends )

692
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:35,143
- Who are they?
- The jury.

693
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:36,508
What are they doing?

694
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:40,777
Taking down their names in case
they forget them before the trial ends.

695
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,943
- (Chicken clucking)
- Stupid things.

696
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:46,414
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
- (Gavel bangs )

697
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:49,287
- Silence in court!
- (Coughing)

698
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,884
- (Chicken clucking)
- Read the accusation.

699
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:54,657
The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
All on a summer's day:

700
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:58,895
The <i>K</i>nave of Hearts, he stole those tarts
And took them quite away!

701
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:00,629
- (Chicken clucking)
- Consider your verdict.

702
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:04,002
Not yet, not yet!
There's a great deal to do before that!

703
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:06,007
- (Chicken clucking)
- Is there? Oh, dear.

704
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:08,373
Well, um...er...

705
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:11,072
call the first witness.

706
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:14,075
First witness.

707
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:17,517
- (Chicken clucking)
- (Coughing)

708
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:19,487
(Mad Hatter chuckles )

709
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,689
Good morning.

710
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:26,058
Hello.

711
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:27,653
(Chuckles )

712
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:35,696
Come on, come on.

713
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:37,501
Oh, yes.

714
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,371
(Horse whinnies )

715
00:59:39,442 --> 00:59:41,774
Come on! Come along!

716
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:47,949
(Horse whinnies )

717
00:59:55,892 --> 00:59:58,827
- (Mad Hatter laughing)
- (Horse whinnies )

718
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:02,831
Oh, I beg your pardon, Your Majesty,
for bringing these along,

719
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:07,893
but I hadn't quite finished my tea
when I was sent for.

720
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:11,463
Well, you ought to have finished.
When did you begin?

721
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:13,600
The, er...

722
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:16,611
Let me see. I think it was the, er...

723
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:20,115
- 14th of March.
- 15th.

724
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:22,310
- 16th?
- Yes.

725
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:24,649
16th. Write that down.

726
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:27,884
And take off your hat.

727
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:30,687
Ah...it, um...it...

728
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,091
Oh, dear.

729
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:34,721
It is...it isn't...it isn't mine.

730
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,788
- It's, er...
- (Clucking)

731
01:00:36,866 --> 01:00:38,163
Stolen, is it?

732
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:40,293
No, no, no. I, er...

733
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:42,861
I keep them to sell, Your Majesty, you see.

734
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:45,100
I'm a...I'm a hatter.

735
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:49,641
- A very nervous hatter.
- Yes, I am, yes.

736
01:00:49,712 --> 01:00:51,441
- Well, don't be nervous.
- No.

737
01:00:51,514 --> 01:00:56,781
Don't be nervous. Just give your evidence,
or I shall have you executed, you know.

738
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:59,378
I'm...I'm allowed to do that.

739
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:02,390
- I can have anyone executed.
- Yes, yes.

740
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:04,085
I have the power...power.

741
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:08,529
Ah...I'm a very poor man, Your Majesty.

742
01:01:08,598 --> 01:01:11,692
And I hadn't begun my tea...

743
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:14,100
well, not above a week or so,

744
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,968
and what with the bread and butter
getting so thin...

745
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,032
- (Chicken clucking)
- ..and the twinkling of tea, I...

746
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:23,476
- Tinkling of the what?
- Er...it began with the tea.

747
01:01:23,546 --> 01:01:26,606
Oh! I know that.

748
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:30,119
I'm not a fool.
I know that twinkling begins with a T.

749
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:33,383
- Oh.
- I'm not a complete idiot, am I?

750
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:35,083
- (Clears throat)
- Go on, go on.

751
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:39,288
Like I said, Your Majesty,
I'm a...I'm a poor man

752
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:42,559
and, um...most things twinkled after that.

753
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:44,793
- I didn't.
- You did.

754
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:47,961
- I didn't. I deny it.
- He denies it.

755
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:50,631
- (Clucking)
- Leave out that part.

756
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:55,667
After that, I, er...
I cut some bread and butter and...

757
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:57,110
And after that, what happened?

758
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:00,616
Ah, that...that I can't remember.

759
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:04,346
Yes, yes, well, you must remember it,
or I'll have to have you executed.

760
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:07,685
I'm a...I'm a poor man, Your Majesty.

761
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:11,022
You are a jolly poor speaker, that's for sure.

762
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:14,461
Get down, sit down and stand clear away.

763
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:17,556
(Chuckles ) Oh, thank you.

764
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:20,295
God bless you, Your Majesty. Ha-ha-ha!

765
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:23,304
- (Chicken clucking)
- (Mad Hatter chuckling)

766
01:02:24,974 --> 01:02:27,238
Excuse me.

767
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:31,440
I do hope you manage
to get the funds to pay it.

768
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:34,142
- (Chicken clucking)
- Next witness.

769
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:45,189
- Give your evidence.
- Shan't.

770
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:51,463
Oh, well, that's the end of that, then.

771
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,227
Aah!

772
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:56,635
Your Majesty must cross-examine
this witness.

773
01:02:56,706 --> 01:02:58,731
- Must I?
- Yes.

774
01:02:58,808 --> 01:03:00,833
Oh.

775
01:03:03,646 --> 01:03:05,910
Oh.

776
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:07,574
Thank you.

777
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:13,586
What are tarts made of?

778
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:15,886
- Pepper mostly.
- (Snorts )

779
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:19,384
Anything you want to add to that?

780
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:20,895
Yes, go away.

781
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,761
Go away with the pepper.

782
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:26,267
Oh.

783
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:31,602
- Next witness.
- No, don't let's have another witness.

784
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:36,475
Let's have a....let's have a song.

785
01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:40,038
Come on, lads, give us a melody.
Come along now.

786
01:03:40,116 --> 01:03:43,244
We... We've all rehearsed.

787
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:46,288
# And we'll all

788
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:50,018
# Swing together

789
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:52,788
# Britain shall be saved

790
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:56,161
# In all sorts of weather

791
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:58,462
# Come what may

792
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:02,061
# And we'll all swing together

793
01:04:02,138 --> 01:04:06,040
# With our bodies between our knees

794
01:04:06,108 --> 01:04:09,874
# Yes, we'll all swing together

795
01:04:09,946 --> 01:04:15,282
# With our bodies between our knees...

796
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:17,717
- (Clucking)
- Ah.

797
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:20,483
They don't reach verdicts like that any more.

798
01:04:20,556 --> 01:04:22,421
Oh dear.

799
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:24,254
Right.

800
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:26,295
Next witness.

801
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:28,758
Alice!

802
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:33,029
Ah. What have you got to say for yourself?

803
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:34,729
Nothing.

804
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:36,795
- Nothing?
- Nothing whatever.

805
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:38,568
Oh, that's very important.

806
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:43,306
(Whispers ) Unimportant,
Your Majesty means, of course.

807
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:45,176
Ah. Oh.

808
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:50,117
Oh. I thought I meant important.
That's what I thought I meant.

809
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:54,014
Ah. Oh.

810
01:04:56,993 --> 01:04:58,290
Oh.

811
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:01,663
Oh.

812
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,756
Ah.

813
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:08,835
(Snores )

814
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:11,135
(Hiccups )

815
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:13,698
Ah.

816
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:15,710
(Hums tune )

817
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:18,246
(Snorts )

818
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:21,680
(Animal roars )

819
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,844
Ahh!

820
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,253
Silence in court! Silence in court!

821
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:28,915
(Cough)

822
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:35,396
All persons more than a mile high
to leave, er...court!

823
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:39,230
- I'm not a mile high.
- Yes, you are.

824
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:41,463
Nearly two miles high.

825
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:43,334
(Clucking)

826
01:05:43,406 --> 01:05:46,068
Consider your silences.

827
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,501
Their verses.

828
01:05:48,577 --> 01:05:52,035
No, no, no, no!
There's more evidence to come yet.

829
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:53,809
This paper's just been picked up.

830
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:56,681
- What's in it?
- I haven't opened it yet.

831
01:05:56,752 --> 01:05:59,687
But it seems to be a letter
written by the prisoner to somebody.

832
01:05:59,755 --> 01:06:02,223
Well, it must be that.

833
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:07,319
I mean, it can't just be written to nobody.
I mean, you can't just write to nobody.

834
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:10,229
I mean, if you did that all the time, the...

835
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:13,268
Well, I mean
the post office'd come to a standstill.

836
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:15,327
I mean, you've got to have somebody...

837
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:18,862
I mean, well...

838
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:21,102
Well, it's not allowed.

839
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:22,735
Who's it directed to?

840
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:27,010
It isn't directed at all. In fact,
there's nothing written on the outside.

841
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:28,778
(Coughing)

842
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:33,288
It isn't a letter at all. It's a set of verses.

843
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:36,291
- Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?
- No, they're not.

844
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:39,157
And that's the queerest thing about it.

845
01:06:39,228 --> 01:06:45,428
You've been imitating people's hands
and writings again.

846
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:47,469
(Oinks ) Please, Your Majesty.

847
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:49,902
I didn't...

848
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:52,600
(Oinks ) ..write it.

849
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:56,042
And I can... (Oinks ) ..prove that I didn't.

850
01:06:56,112 --> 01:07:00,640
(Oinks ) There's no name signed at the end.

851
01:07:00,716 --> 01:07:03,480
(<i>K</i>ing of Hearts ) Well, that only makes
the matter worse.

852
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:05,179
You must have meant some mischief

853
01:07:05,254 --> 01:07:09,315
or else you would have signed your name
like an honest man.

854
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:12,691
- (Queen of Hearts ) That proves his guilt.
- It proves nothing of the sort.

855
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:14,730
- Hold your tongue.
- I won't.

856
01:07:14,797 --> 01:07:18,324
- (Clucking)
- Off with her head! Off with her head!

857
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:22,201
Off with her head! Off with her head!

858
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:26,632
Off with her head! Off with her head!

859
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:29,007
Off with her head!

860
01:07:29,078 --> 01:07:32,639
Off with her head! Off with her head!

861
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,814
- (Birds screech)
- (Church bell tolls)

862
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:08,175
It is not now as it has been of yore;-

863
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:11,879
Turn wheresoe'er I may
By night or day

864
01:08:11,954 --> 01:08:16,357
The things which I have seen
I now can see no more
