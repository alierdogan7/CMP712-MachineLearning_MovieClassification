1
00:03:25,085 --> 00:03:28,521
My friends, this is Paris.

2
00:03:28,688 --> 00:03:33,125
Gay, beautiful, wonderful,
magnificent Paris.

3
00:03:33,293 --> 00:03:37,229
Paris: The tender mother of romance.

4
00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:40,298
Of love. Of amour.

5
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:45,564
But not all the love stories
of France begin in Paris. No, no, no.

6
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:50,676
There was one, for example, a quite
unusual one that began in the hot...

7
00:03:50,844 --> 00:03:53,938
...sun-drenched region
in the south of France...

8
00:03:54,114 --> 00:03:57,572
...in the province known as Provence.

9
00:03:57,751 --> 00:04:00,481
The time is around
the turn of the century.

10
00:04:00,654 --> 00:04:03,088
You call it the Gay Nineties, no?

11
00:04:03,256 --> 00:04:05,656
But that is beside the point.

12
00:04:05,825 --> 00:04:08,885
This is the story of a little
female citizen of France...

13
00:04:09,062 --> 00:04:12,896
...who is as beautiful and as innocent
as her name.

14
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:15,830
And her name is Mewsette.

15
00:04:16,503 --> 00:04:20,769
No last name. Just Mewsette.

16
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:28,140
Hello, Jaune Tom.

17
00:05:28,975 --> 00:05:30,465
Hello, Mewsette.

18
00:05:30,644 --> 00:05:34,410
That was a very nice song
you were singing, Jaune Tom.

19
00:05:34,581 --> 00:05:37,846
- Please sing some more for me.
- Mewsette...

20
00:05:38,018 --> 00:05:41,044
...you know I can't sing it
when you're looking at me.

21
00:05:42,489 --> 00:05:44,753
Amour, amour...

22
00:05:44,924 --> 00:05:47,722
...a- mush.

23
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,042
Jaune Tom! Jaune Tom!

24
00:06:10,216 --> 00:06:13,208
Jaune Tom, you're wonderful.

25
00:06:13,386 --> 00:06:15,616
Jaune Tom!

26
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:23,286
A moose! A moose!

27
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:26,159
I mean, a mouse.
It's as big as a moose.

28
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:29,302
- I mean, it's a whopper.
- A mouse?

29
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:30,993
Where? Where?

30
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:33,662
At the barn. Hurry! Hurry!

31
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,298
Come on, let's go!

32
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:47,310
Jaune Tom, you're a...

33
00:06:47,487 --> 00:06:51,389
...clumsy country clod.

34
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:45,977
Bravo! Bravo!

35
00:07:46,212 --> 00:07:49,238
Bravo!

36
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:13,003
Hey, Jaune Tom.
What are we going to do with our mouse?

37
00:08:13,773 --> 00:08:16,264
We'll wrap it as a gift
and give it to Mewsette.

38
00:08:16,443 --> 00:08:19,207
Mewsette...

39
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:22,348
That's all I ever hear
around this place.

40
00:08:47,307 --> 00:08:52,609
But, my dear sister, how can you
continue to bury yourself on this farm?

41
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:56,875
I like it here, Jeunesse, chérie.
I choose to live here.

42
00:08:57,183 --> 00:09:01,313
And now, tell me about
this friend of yours in Paris.

43
00:09:01,488 --> 00:09:06,221
- Is he nice?
- My dear sister, what manners.

44
00:09:06,493 --> 00:09:07,790
So polished.

45
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:12,227
Not at all like the plebeian peasants
you would meet out here.

46
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:15,492
The peasants,
they are good and honest...

47
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:17,568
...and very happy.

48
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,364
Happy, on this pile of dust?

49
00:09:20,573 --> 00:09:25,101
How can you allow yourself
to go to seed like a fat duck?

50
00:09:25,311 --> 00:09:30,180
- Ducks don't go to seed, my dear sister.
- Well, like a vegetable then.

51
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,808
That's what you are, Marie:
A cabbage, an artichoke.

52
00:09:33,987 --> 00:09:38,788
True, Jeunesse, and vegetables
are happiest on farms.

53
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:43,793
But, darling, think of Paris.
Lovely, gay Paris.

54
00:09:44,497 --> 00:09:49,799
Have you forgotten the sidewalk cafes
and how we sipped champagne?

55
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:54,929
Champagne. That must be what
they call catnip in Paris.

56
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:56,302
How nice.

57
00:09:56,509 --> 00:10:00,445
The button champignons sauteed
in butter with tiny shreds of ham.

58
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:02,080
Champignons.

59
00:10:02,248 --> 00:10:06,184
I know what they are. Mushrooms!
And delicious too.

60
00:10:06,352 --> 00:10:11,221
- And, my dear, the Champs Elysees.
- Champs Elysées?

61
00:10:11,391 --> 00:10:15,851
- I wonder what they taste like.
- Oh, what a lovely feline.

62
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:18,088
Too bad her beauty is wasted here.

63
00:10:18,264 --> 00:10:22,963
Now, in Paris, she would be
perfumed and curled...

64
00:10:23,136 --> 00:10:25,798
...and have a stunning coiffure.

65
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:29,463
We would go everywhere in style,
wouldn't we, chérie?

66
00:10:29,676 --> 00:10:33,305
The Rivoli, Maxim's, the Place Pigalle...

67
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:36,039
...boating on the Seine...

68
00:10:36,215 --> 00:10:40,345
...with the music of Paris
surrounding and caressing us.

69
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:46,288
Oh, those nights. So sparkling, so clear,
that each star becomes...

70
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:49,895
...the glittering point
of a great blue diamond.

71
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:33,318
Mewsette!

72
00:13:33,493 --> 00:13:36,257
Hey, Mewsette!

73
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:39,589
What's the matter?
Are you deaf or something?

74
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:42,927
No. I am not deaf or something.

75
00:13:43,136 --> 00:13:45,331
Come on, come on.
Read the poem.

76
00:13:45,505 --> 00:13:49,942
Okay, okay.
You don't have to push.

77
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:55,005
A poem, dedicated to Mewsette.

78
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:59,811
To Mewsette, the prettiest cat
In all of France

79
00:14:02,622 --> 00:14:06,080
All right, all right.
It's your poem.

80
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:09,228
Roses are red
violets are blue

81
00:14:09,395 --> 00:14:11,693
Here is a mouse from me to you

82
00:14:11,864 --> 00:14:13,798
Signed, Jaune Tom.

83
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:21,697
Jaune Tom! You take that horrid,
vulgar thing away from here this minute!

84
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:23,870
I've never been so insulted.

85
00:14:24,043 --> 00:14:29,037
How dare you think that I would eat
such a coarse, plebeian thing.

86
00:14:29,482 --> 00:14:30,471
But...

87
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,881
- But cats like mice.
- Perhaps so.

88
00:14:34,053 --> 00:14:38,854
- But I am not a cat, I'll have you know.
- You're not a...?

89
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:41,050
- You're not a cat?
- Not a cat?

90
00:14:41,394 --> 00:14:43,692
I am a...

91
00:14:43,863 --> 00:14:46,058
A... feline.

92
00:14:46,265 --> 00:14:50,224
- A feline?
- You're a fe... What?

93
00:14:51,037 --> 00:14:53,232
I think she means a female, Robespierre.

94
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:57,808
And all felines really like
is champagne and champignons...

95
00:14:57,977 --> 00:15:00,411
...and Champs Elysees...

96
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:05,277
And all I get on this farm
is mice and milk!

97
00:15:06,285 --> 00:15:11,746
I feel like a cabbage that's gone
to seed. Like a fat duck!

98
00:15:12,692 --> 00:15:15,422
Gosh, Mewsette,
you're not as fat as a duck.

99
00:15:15,828 --> 00:15:20,288
Oh, go away, you ple... Ple...

100
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:23,435
Plebeian peasant, you!

101
00:15:23,603 --> 00:15:27,437
I never want to see you again.

102
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:30,441
I wish I were dead!

103
00:15:30,843 --> 00:15:34,574
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo!
So do we.

104
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:37,773
Don't we, Jaune Tom?
Jaune Tom?

105
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:40,385
Jaune Tom?

106
00:15:40,987 --> 00:15:44,787
Now look what you've done,
you... You old feline, you!

107
00:15:46,626 --> 00:15:47,957
Plebeians!

108
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,790
Well, if you don't like us "plebleens,"
why don't you go away with her?

109
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:59,464
I'll bet she just lives on "cham-pag-ne" and
"cham-pygmy-ons" and "champs-ulysses."

110
00:15:59,672 --> 00:16:03,904
Why, Robespierre, that's a wonderful idea.
That's exactly what I'll do.

111
00:16:04,076 --> 00:16:08,103
I'll go to Paris.
No more mice and milk for me!

112
00:16:08,281 --> 00:16:12,479
Well, bon voyage, Mademoiselle Feline.

113
00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:18,317
Au revoir, Robespierre!
Take good care of Jaune Tom!

114
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:20,982
What do you know?
She did it!

115
00:16:21,193 --> 00:16:23,525
I must have a way with felines.

116
00:16:23,696 --> 00:16:26,722
We're free! Free!

117
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:28,696
Free at last!

118
00:16:28,868 --> 00:16:32,827
Well, you're a mouse.
You ought to know.

119
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,506
Why didn't she like you?

120
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:39,644
Did you ever have any trouble
like that with your girl?

121
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:45,512
Oh. You are a girl.

122
00:16:45,718 --> 00:16:49,449
Well, then tell me something
from the girl's point of view.

123
00:16:49,622 --> 00:16:52,147
What's wrong with me?

124
00:16:52,925 --> 00:16:55,359
Jaune Tom! Jaune Tom!

125
00:16:55,962 --> 00:17:00,296
- Where are you, Jaune Tom?
- Over here, Robespierre.

126
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:03,367
You can come on back now.
Everything's okay.

127
00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:06,197
You mean Mewsette...?
Mewsette'll take the mouse?

128
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:09,667
No. She's left, Jaune Tom.
Took off.

129
00:17:09,842 --> 00:17:13,676
- Nothing but fun now that Mewsette's gone.
- What do you mean she's gone?

130
00:17:13,879 --> 00:17:16,712
- She just went away in a carriage.
- Carriage?

131
00:17:16,882 --> 00:17:20,477
- What carriage?
- The one that took her to Paris.

132
00:17:20,653 --> 00:17:26,387
- Well, why did she go to Paris?
- All felines go to Paris, I guess.

133
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,357
Come on, Jaune Tom.
Let's go mouse hunting.

134
00:17:29,562 --> 00:17:31,393
Mewsette!

135
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,597
Hey. Wait for me!

136
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:41,233
Mewsette! Come back, Mewsette!

137
00:17:55,721 --> 00:18:00,658
For the last time, my lad,
if your friend arrived in that buggy...

138
00:18:00,826 --> 00:18:03,226
...she has gone to Paris.

139
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:07,456
All right. I know that, but where's Paris?
What is Paris?

140
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:11,261
What is Paris?

141
00:18:11,437 --> 00:18:15,965
- Are you mad?
- Is it a school or something for felines?

142
00:18:16,442 --> 00:18:19,240
A school for felines?

143
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:24,281
- No? Well, a village, maybe?
- Yes.

144
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:30,855
That is what it is. A little village
a mile or two up the tracks.

145
00:18:31,023 --> 00:18:36,984
And now, if you don't mind,
I do have work to do.

146
00:18:37,196 --> 00:18:39,289
Well, thanks a lot.

147
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:46,330
Jaune Tom! Jaune Tom!

148
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:52,671
- Pardon me, sir, but did you see...?
- He went thataway.

149
00:18:52,845 --> 00:18:56,337
Gee, thanks. Jaune Tom!

150
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:16,317
Good morning, Jaune Tom.

151
00:20:17,196 --> 00:20:21,792
Nighty-night.

152
00:21:04,443 --> 00:21:06,877
I can hardly believe it!

153
00:21:07,046 --> 00:21:09,514
I'm really on my way to Paris!

154
00:23:11,136 --> 00:23:13,627
Delightful.

155
00:23:13,806 --> 00:23:16,741
Delightful city, isn't it?

156
00:23:17,743 --> 00:23:19,267
Oh, yes, sir.

157
00:23:19,445 --> 00:23:23,404
Even more beautiful than
I dreamed it would be.

158
00:23:23,682 --> 00:23:27,413
- First trip to Paris?
- Oh, yes.

159
00:23:27,586 --> 00:23:31,022
- Visiting relatives?
- Oh, no.

160
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:35,217
I just up and decided that I'd
vegetated too long on that dreary farm...

161
00:23:35,394 --> 00:23:38,989
...and that every girl should see Paris
and Jaune Tom is so dull...

162
00:23:39,164 --> 00:23:42,565
...and I don't know anybody in Paris
and it's all so wonderful...

163
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:48,568
Oh, but you must think I'm terribly bold
to talk this way to a stranger.

164
00:23:49,308 --> 00:23:54,644
Not at all. I think your enthusiasm
is charming, and I'm not offended.

165
00:23:55,214 --> 00:23:59,617
Oh, thank you.
I just know I'll be happy here.

166
00:23:59,785 --> 00:24:05,314
Of course. But like any big city,
Paris has its pitfalls.

167
00:24:05,524 --> 00:24:09,654
Oh, I realie that.
But after all, I'm...

168
00:24:09,828 --> 00:24:15,164
I'm not exactly a kitten anymore.
I choose my friends very carefully.

169
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:17,961
And that's very wise, my dear.

170
00:24:18,137 --> 00:24:22,506
Nevertheless, there are still a few
unscrupulous characters about.

171
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:26,610
- Oh, dear me.
- You need a friend, a sponsor.

172
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:31,807
- Now, l...
- But that would hardly be proper, would it?

173
00:24:32,017 --> 00:24:38,149
Mademoiselle! You cannot be inferring
that I would suggest anything improper.

174
00:24:38,457 --> 00:24:42,484
Oh, dear, no. Oh.
Please forgive me. It's just that...

175
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:47,926
I thought that my sister,
one of the most influential cats in Paris...

176
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,160
...might be persuaded
to take you under her wing.

177
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:56,774
Teach you all you need to know,
introduce you to society.

178
00:24:56,942 --> 00:24:59,809
But of course, if you would prefer
to go it yourself...

179
00:24:59,978 --> 00:25:05,541
...alone in a strange city, by all means.
- Oh, no, please.

180
00:25:05,717 --> 00:25:09,653
- I would love to meet your sister.
- Then it is settled.

181
00:25:09,822 --> 00:25:12,347
Come along, my dear.

182
00:26:57,229 --> 00:26:58,992
Jaune Tom!

183
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:06,101
What are we doing down here,
Jaune Tom?

184
00:27:07,573 --> 00:27:12,510
Let's go home before
something happens to us.

185
00:27:12,711 --> 00:27:16,112
I can't, Robespierre.
I have to find Mewsette.

186
00:27:16,281 --> 00:27:21,742
Well, you look for Mewsette.
I'm gonna look for trains.

187
00:27:27,993 --> 00:27:30,985
Is it much further to
your sister's shop, monsieur?

188
00:27:31,163 --> 00:27:34,257
No. It is just a little
further along this street.

189
00:27:34,766 --> 00:27:39,260
Yes. Here we are, my dear,
the best in all Paris.

190
00:27:39,471 --> 00:27:44,101
"Salon de Beaute Pour Felines.
Mme. Rubens-Chatte."

191
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:54,943
Meowrice, how nice to see you again.

192
00:27:55,153 --> 00:28:00,489
- This is Mewsette, my dear sister.
- Isn't she pretty?

193
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:04,151
Any sister of Meowrice is a friend of mine.

194
00:28:04,329 --> 00:28:08,288
Henrietta, you are my sister.

195
00:28:08,467 --> 00:28:10,935
Sister!

196
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,804
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

197
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,132
She is an old dear
but a little absent-minded.

198
00:28:18,343 --> 00:28:21,312
Imagine, not even remembering
your own brother!

199
00:28:22,814 --> 00:28:26,511
- Yes.
- How silly of me.

200
00:28:26,685 --> 00:28:32,419
Of course I'm his sister.
I've been his sister for years.

201
00:28:32,624 --> 00:28:37,755
Mewsette is new to Paris, dear sister.
I have told her of your wonderful salon...

202
00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:42,491
...where you will make her
into the belle of all Paris.

203
00:28:42,701 --> 00:28:48,230
- Of course, dear brother.
- Then she is all yours, Henrietta.

204
00:28:48,407 --> 00:28:53,106
- You know what must be done.
- Now, look here, Meowrice.

205
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:58,442
It's going to take time and money
to make a lady out of this cat.

206
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,710
So this time, I want
something in advance.

207
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,615
Don't rush things, my dear.

208
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:07,953
Just remember, time is on the side
of the scoundrel.

209
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:13,598
- And you are the king of the scoundrels.
- Yes.

210
00:29:13,765 --> 00:29:18,361
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have some business to attend to.

211
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:43,661
All right. Now listen carefully.

212
00:29:46,531 --> 00:29:50,934
So I want one of you to keep
an eye on that girl at all times.

213
00:29:51,103 --> 00:29:52,570
Is that clear?

214
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:13,055
As they say,
"Evil is the root of all money."

215
00:30:13,225 --> 00:30:15,352
Money trees, that is.

216
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,427
Big green money trees.

217
00:32:40,939 --> 00:32:45,399
Gosh! We'll never find Paris
in all those buildings and things.

218
00:32:45,577 --> 00:32:49,980
- Yeah. There's a lot of them, all right.
- I told you it was a wild-goose chase.

219
00:32:50,148 --> 00:32:53,117
- Come on. Let's go home.
- No, Robespierre.

220
00:32:53,285 --> 00:32:57,585
- I can't go back without Mewsette.
- Well, I can.

221
00:32:57,756 --> 00:32:59,917
So long, Jaune Tom.

222
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:03,026
I'm gonna miss you, Robespierre.
Take care of yourself.

223
00:33:03,194 --> 00:33:06,994
Take care of myself?
Who's gonna take care of him?

224
00:33:07,165 --> 00:33:09,929
Without me, no telling what'll happen to him.

225
00:33:10,101 --> 00:33:14,265
Alone, friendless, far from home.

226
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:16,830
Well, don't just stand there.

227
00:33:17,008 --> 00:33:19,169
Let's start looking.

228
00:33:21,413 --> 00:33:23,608
Mewsette!

229
00:33:24,115 --> 00:33:27,107
Mewsette!

230
00:33:27,285 --> 00:33:31,619
Mewsette!

231
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:34,190
Mewsette!

232
00:33:36,361 --> 00:33:40,297
- Quiet! Stop that noise!
- Go away, you silly little pussycats.

233
00:33:40,465 --> 00:33:42,956
- Get away from here!
- Scram! Go on!

234
00:33:57,515 --> 00:34:01,884
Leave those cats out of here!
Allez!

235
00:34:16,768 --> 00:34:20,329
I don't know why she ever came to Paris.

236
00:34:20,538 --> 00:34:23,996
I don't know why you ever came to Paris.

237
00:34:24,209 --> 00:34:29,010
Your purr, my dear,
it's like a cement mixer.

238
00:34:29,214 --> 00:34:33,014
But that's the way I purred
back home on the farm.

239
00:34:33,218 --> 00:34:35,686
Well, it won't do here.

240
00:34:35,887 --> 00:34:41,018
It must be refined, yet seductive.

241
00:34:41,226 --> 00:34:43,660
Like this:

242
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:54,696
Now try again and put
some throat into it.

243
00:35:02,847 --> 00:35:04,747
Stop!

244
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:09,615
- Oh, stop!
- Oh, I'm sorry, Madame Rubens-Chatte.

245
00:35:09,821 --> 00:35:13,518
Being sorry isn't enough.
Now, look, child.

246
00:35:13,691 --> 00:35:18,060
We don't want to disappoint
Meowrice, do we?

247
00:35:18,263 --> 00:35:23,860
- Oh, no. I'll try very hard this time.
- Good.

248
00:35:24,035 --> 00:35:27,562
Now, let's show him how
poised and gracefully...

249
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:32,802
...we walk with a bowl
of milk on our head.

250
00:35:33,011 --> 00:35:35,809
Now walk towards me.
Head erect.

251
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:39,916
Turn right. Left.
Reverse.

252
00:35:40,452 --> 00:35:42,647
Oh, look out!

253
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:49,222
Oh, no.

254
00:35:49,394 --> 00:35:54,331
I'm a failure. I'll never be a Parisian.

255
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:59,967
I'm going back home,
back with the peasants...

256
00:36:00,138 --> 00:36:04,199
...where I belong.
- No! No! Stop her! Stop her!

257
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:06,843
Stop her yourself.

258
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,013
My poor dear.
I know just how you feel.

259
00:36:14,185 --> 00:36:20,021
Wouldn't you like to stroll on the
boulevard, stop at a sidewalk cafe?

260
00:36:20,191 --> 00:36:25,720
- And order Champs Elysees, just once.
- Of course, my pet.

261
00:36:25,897 --> 00:36:28,422
Let us be gay.
We shall do the town.

262
00:37:07,338 --> 00:37:11,707
- Do you feel better now, my dear?
- Oh, yes.

263
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:17,439
Those sidewalk cafes were so much fun.
And Paris is so beautiful!

264
00:37:17,615 --> 00:37:21,574
And I feel so important
riding in a buggy and...

265
00:37:21,753 --> 00:37:24,916
Oh, good heavens, Meowrice.
What are they doing?

266
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:28,183
Oh, them? Why, they are kissing, chérie.

267
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:30,088
- What's kissing?
- Kissing?

268
00:37:30,261 --> 00:37:34,061
Why, kissing is...
Like rubbing noses.

269
00:37:34,265 --> 00:37:36,563
But do they only kiss in buggies?

270
00:37:36,768 --> 00:37:40,932
Well, if you did away with buggies,
you'd stop half the kissing in Paris.

271
00:37:41,105 --> 00:37:43,005
How strange. Why is that?

272
00:37:45,076 --> 00:37:51,504
Because, my naive one, there is
nothing so romantic as a buggy ride.

273
00:39:22,006 --> 00:39:25,669
- Here we are.
- Oh! So soon?

274
00:39:25,877 --> 00:39:32,009
- Now, back to your lessons, my dear.
- Goodbye, Meowrice. And thank you!

275
00:39:32,183 --> 00:39:37,951
How foolish I was.
I'll never think of that dull farm again.

276
00:39:39,157 --> 00:39:44,686
I tell you, Jaune Tom, it's hopeless.
Absolutely hopeless.

277
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:48,696
- She's probably miles from here.
- Yeah.

278
00:39:48,866 --> 00:39:53,098
- Yeah, I suppose you're right, Robespierre.
- Well, come on then.

279
00:39:53,271 --> 00:39:56,729
- Let's go back to the farm.
- Okay. Okay.

280
00:39:56,908 --> 00:39:59,274
Now you're talking!

281
00:40:01,245 --> 00:40:05,181
Robespierre, look!
Look what it says: "Felines"!

282
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:10,014
That's what Mewsette said she was.
I'll bet they'd know where she is.

283
00:40:10,722 --> 00:40:14,021
Here we go again.

284
00:40:15,827 --> 00:40:17,692
Jaune Tom!

285
00:40:17,862 --> 00:40:20,729
Help, Jaune Tom!

286
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:24,566
Jaune Tom! Help!

287
00:40:26,637 --> 00:40:30,573
- Who is it, dearie?
- There's no one here.

288
00:40:30,742 --> 00:40:32,403
No one at all.

289
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,869
Help!

290
00:40:48,826 --> 00:40:53,763
You know, Robespierre, we're seeing parts
of Paris that the tourists usually miss.

291
00:40:53,931 --> 00:40:57,594
Let's find our way out of here
and get back to that feline place.

292
00:41:13,484 --> 00:41:18,148
"Mr. Henry Phtt, 1411 Sand Box Road...

293
00:41:18,322 --> 00:41:22,088
...Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.A."

294
00:41:24,462 --> 00:41:26,430
"Dear Mr. Phtt:

295
00:41:26,597 --> 00:41:32,832
At long last, I have found a bride for you.
With proper schooling now underway...

296
00:41:33,004 --> 00:41:37,407
...she will be the most beautiful
and talented cat in the world.

297
00:41:37,575 --> 00:41:40,305
I shall keep you informed
of her progress.

298
00:41:40,478 --> 00:41:45,506
Your obedient servant,
Meowrice Percy Beaucoup."

299
00:41:50,855 --> 00:41:55,053
"P.S. I'm afraid that
the price we agreed upon...

300
00:41:55,226 --> 00:41:58,718
...must, under the circumstances,
be doubled.

301
00:41:58,896 --> 00:42:02,798
There are other suitors."

302
00:42:09,807 --> 00:42:12,537
Well, I'm off to mail this letter.

303
00:42:13,044 --> 00:42:17,538
If you ever decide to marry,
boys, marry for love...

304
00:42:17,815 --> 00:42:19,874
...of money.

305
00:43:05,463 --> 00:43:11,800
Jaune Tom, you take that horrid,
vulgar thing away from here this minute!

306
00:43:35,626 --> 00:43:40,495
Pardon me, my friend, but that was
the most remarkable exhibition...

307
00:43:40,665 --> 00:43:43,964
...of "virtu-mouse-ity"
I've ever witnessed.

308
00:43:44,135 --> 00:43:47,593
- Virtu-what-sity?
- Virtu-mouse-ity.

309
00:43:47,772 --> 00:43:52,106
A little phrase I coined to describe
the incredible proficiency...

310
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:55,973
...you just displayed
in apprehending that rodent.

311
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:02,676
Obviously, it was too small.
Throwing it back was such a noble gesture.

312
00:44:02,853 --> 00:44:07,620
It is an imposition, I know,
but it would afford me great pleasure...

313
00:44:07,825 --> 00:44:12,057
...if you would join me for a bite
of dinner and perhaps a sip of...

314
00:44:12,229 --> 00:44:15,289
We accept! We accept!

315
00:44:15,466 --> 00:44:18,196
Name's Robespierre, manager of him...

316
00:44:18,369 --> 00:44:21,861
...Jaune Tom,
the world's greatest mouser.

317
00:44:22,306 --> 00:44:24,035
And now can we eat?

318
00:44:25,009 --> 00:44:28,706
It would seem to be
out of our hands, monsieur.

319
00:45:14,325 --> 00:45:17,624
What'll it be your pleasure
you're having, s'il vous plait?

320
00:45:21,999 --> 00:45:24,399
- Milk.
- Milk?

321
00:45:24,602 --> 00:45:28,436
No, no. Let's really
live it up big, Jaune Tom.

322
00:45:28,606 --> 00:45:32,372
- Straight cream.
- No, no, messieurs.

323
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:36,673
On an occasion such as this,
we drink champagne.

324
00:45:36,847 --> 00:45:38,542
Champagne, garcon.

325
00:45:38,716 --> 00:45:42,709
Champagne for the greatest
mouse catcher in all France...

326
00:45:42,887 --> 00:45:45,378
...and his manager.

327
00:45:47,692 --> 00:45:51,958
One bottle of champagne,
hot off the ice.

328
00:46:08,779 --> 00:46:12,306
Hey, it's made out of bubbles.

329
00:46:26,897 --> 00:46:30,333
I just wanna tell you...

330
00:46:30,701 --> 00:46:34,797
...that you're all a wonderful
bunch of gentlemen.

331
00:46:34,972 --> 00:46:36,337
Everyone.

332
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,301
I saloosh...

333
00:46:38,476 --> 00:46:41,343
Shaloot...
I salute you!

334
00:48:58,916 --> 00:49:00,406
What a head.

335
00:49:00,584 --> 00:49:02,711
What a head!

336
00:49:02,887 --> 00:49:08,257
Here, what is this?
A turtle, perhaps?

337
00:49:08,425 --> 00:49:11,019
A turtle with a hangover?

338
00:49:12,296 --> 00:49:16,323
A two-headed turtle? Impossible.

339
00:49:18,269 --> 00:49:20,897
Where are you going, turtle?

340
00:49:23,073 --> 00:49:25,405
What do you know?
This is no turtle.

341
00:49:25,576 --> 00:49:28,909
It's just a small, bloodshot kitten.

342
00:49:30,281 --> 00:49:33,250
Oh, gently, gently, shipmate.

343
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:35,247
I won't harm your little friend.

344
00:49:35,419 --> 00:49:39,617
You see, we three
are all in the same boat.

345
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:41,690
The same boat.

346
00:49:41,859 --> 00:49:45,260
That is pretty funny.
The same boat, no?

347
00:49:47,698 --> 00:49:49,791
Say... No.
No, I guess not.

348
00:49:49,967 --> 00:49:53,630
The truth is,
we have been shanghaied, shipmates.

349
00:49:53,804 --> 00:49:55,897
Or catnapped, in your case.

350
00:49:56,073 --> 00:49:58,098
And that means we have to work.

351
00:50:07,618 --> 00:50:09,813
Jaune Tom.

352
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:20,124
It's all right, Jaune Tom.
We'll get back all right.

353
00:50:21,031 --> 00:50:24,899
Oh, it's such a big ocean, Robespierre,
bigger than all France.

354
00:50:25,069 --> 00:50:27,128
Bigger than the whole world.

355
00:50:27,338 --> 00:50:31,468
Sure it is, but you've never
given up hope yet.

356
00:50:31,675 --> 00:50:33,734
I have now.

357
00:50:33,911 --> 00:50:38,314
It's too big, Robespierre.
We'll never get back to find Mewsette.

358
00:50:38,582 --> 00:50:41,244
It's not as big as you think, Jaune Tom.

359
00:50:41,418 --> 00:50:45,684
Why, look.
It's just made up of little drops.

360
00:50:45,856 --> 00:50:49,417
It's all how you look at it.
Honestly, Jaune Tom.

361
00:50:51,595 --> 00:50:53,688
Jaune Tom?

362
00:52:53,784 --> 00:52:57,618
There you are, shipmates.
I have good news!

363
00:52:57,788 --> 00:53:01,349
We are headed for Alaska
and the gold rush.

364
00:53:01,558 --> 00:53:07,895
We will strike it rich, my friends.
Then we will return to Paris in style.

365
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,159
No time for games, little turtle.

366
00:53:12,336 --> 00:53:17,364
The rain has stopped and I have work to do.
I must swab the deck, yes?

367
00:54:36,053 --> 00:54:38,248
"Dear Mr. Phtt:

368
00:54:38,422 --> 00:54:43,485
According to your instructions,
I am having Mewsette's portrait painted...

369
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:47,061
...by the most famous artists in Paris.

370
00:54:47,231 --> 00:54:49,756
Many of them are not yet
well-known in America...

371
00:54:49,933 --> 00:54:54,302
...so please allow me to tell you
a little bit about each one.

372
00:54:54,471 --> 00:55:00,876
Claude Monet might well be said to be
the father of the Impressionist movement.

373
00:55:01,044 --> 00:55:05,879
You will notice how Monsieur Monet
achieves a shimmering light...

374
00:55:06,049 --> 00:55:07,710
...throughout the picture...

375
00:55:07,884 --> 00:55:13,379
...and an impression of air and space.

376
00:55:15,659 --> 00:55:20,687
A man of noble birth is
Monsieur Henri Toulouse-Lautrec...

377
00:55:20,864 --> 00:55:27,030
...who is perhaps best known for his
striking posters for the Moulin Rouge.

378
00:55:28,972 --> 00:55:35,275
Pointillism is a highly individual style
developed by Georges Seurat...

379
00:55:35,445 --> 00:55:38,903
...in which he creates
his astonishing effects...

380
00:55:39,082 --> 00:55:43,280
...by the clever placing
of tiny dots of paint...

381
00:55:43,453 --> 00:55:46,115
...next to each other.

382
00:55:49,426 --> 00:55:54,125
Henri Rousseau is an ex-soldier
with no formal art training.

383
00:55:54,298 --> 00:55:57,995
He is known as a 'primitive painter.'

384
00:55:58,168 --> 00:56:00,068
With his vivid imagination...

385
00:56:00,237 --> 00:56:03,229
...he is creating a
charming world of his own...

386
00:56:03,407 --> 00:56:08,367
...where oranges grow on banana trees.

387
00:56:11,315 --> 00:56:16,184
Amedeo Modigliani is
a talented young Italian painter...

388
00:56:16,353 --> 00:56:18,787
...who shows great promise.

389
00:56:18,955 --> 00:56:24,359
Sometimes his models have great difficulty
holding the pose for him.

390
00:56:25,929 --> 00:56:30,298
A Dutch painter who has found
new inspiration here in Paris...

391
00:56:30,467 --> 00:56:35,063
...is a man of violent temperament:
Vincent van Gogh.

392
00:56:35,238 --> 00:56:38,537
To achieve a strong emotional impact...

393
00:56:38,709 --> 00:56:44,579
...he sometimes applies paint
directly from the tube.

394
00:56:47,784 --> 00:56:53,950
Monsieur Edgar Degas frequently uses
ballet dancers as his models.

395
00:56:54,124 --> 00:56:57,992
To arrive at his delicate color harmonies...

396
00:56:58,161 --> 00:57:03,224
...he often uses pastels instead of oil paints.

397
00:57:06,169 --> 00:57:11,004
Don't be concerned when you see
Auguste Renoir's portrait.

398
00:57:11,174 --> 00:57:15,008
Mewsette has not gotten fat.

399
00:57:20,417 --> 00:57:24,615
Monsieur Paul Ceanne
is an intellectual artist.

400
00:57:24,788 --> 00:57:30,624
He is a masterful organier of
color, composition and form.

401
00:57:30,794 --> 00:57:36,232
His subjects often take on
the aspects of a still life.

402
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:45,269
The dynamic Paul Gauguin has
only recently returned from Tahiti...

403
00:57:45,442 --> 00:57:51,005
...and his paintings show the influence
of the South Sea Islands.

404
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:58,180
Another young painter here in Paris
is a volatile Spaniard...

405
00:57:58,355 --> 00:58:03,816
...who shows every indication
of someday setting the art world afire.

406
00:58:03,994 --> 00:58:07,259
His name is Pablo Picasso.

407
00:58:15,405 --> 00:58:21,833
And so, hoping that you will enjoy them,
I ship these paintings on to you.

408
00:58:22,012 --> 00:58:26,142
And tonight I am sending
the original article:

409
00:58:26,316 --> 00:58:29,376
Mewsette herself."

410
00:58:33,123 --> 00:58:36,820
Here. Mail this letter, Armond.

411
00:58:36,993 --> 00:58:40,793
Now, I want no slip-ups.
The train leaves at midnight.

412
00:58:40,964 --> 00:58:44,798
I'll be back shortly with the belle of Paris.

413
00:58:45,068 --> 00:58:49,801
I want you to see that she is
comfortably settled in her...

414
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:52,233
...compartment.

415
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:05,146
I hope my little protegee is ready
for her great adventure, sister.

416
00:59:05,355 --> 00:59:09,314
She is, but you don't get her till I'm paid.

417
00:59:09,493 --> 00:59:13,486
In full.
No money, no Mewsette.

418
00:59:13,697 --> 00:59:16,325
Very well, then.
I'll write you a check.

419
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:20,994
- It's better than money.
- Now, that's more like it.

420
00:59:21,204 --> 00:59:23,138
It will be well worth it, Meowrice.

421
00:59:23,306 --> 00:59:29,336
Mewsette is my greatest achievement,
my crowning glory.

422
00:59:29,546 --> 00:59:33,676
For the sake of your dear neck,
I do hope so.

423
00:59:34,184 --> 00:59:37,210
How gallantly you put your case, Meowrice.

424
00:59:37,387 --> 00:59:40,788
No girl could resist you.

425
00:59:40,957 --> 00:59:44,518
Judge for yourself whether
you're getting your money's worth.

426
00:59:44,694 --> 00:59:50,792
- Mewsette, chérie.
- Yes, dear Madame Rubens-Chatte?

427
00:59:53,970 --> 01:00:00,000
- Why, brother. Don't tell me...?
- Momentary lapse, my dear.

428
01:00:00,176 --> 01:00:03,373
Even cats are sometimes human.

429
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:10,076
Mewsette, my dear young friend,
you are beautiful beyond compare.

430
01:00:10,253 --> 01:00:14,053
Thank you, monsieur.
You are most kind.

431
01:00:14,257 --> 01:00:18,387
Tonight I wish to speak to you
of something very personal.

432
01:00:18,595 --> 01:00:21,655
I think you will agree
that before this night is over...

433
01:00:21,831 --> 01:00:25,733
...all your dreams will come true.

434
01:00:26,403 --> 01:00:29,861
Oh, Madame Rubens-Chatte,
isn't it wonderful?

435
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:34,443
I do thank you for making it all possible.

436
01:00:35,545 --> 01:00:39,345
Come, my dear. Paris awaits you.

437
01:00:39,516 --> 01:00:43,452
And, dear madame, may I say
everything that happens...

438
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:45,417
...is because of your faith in me?

439
01:00:45,855 --> 01:00:48,085
I'll be back soon and tell you about it.

440
01:00:48,725 --> 01:00:51,023
Don't wait up, sister.

441
01:00:51,194 --> 01:00:55,756
It will be later than she thinks.

442
01:00:57,567 --> 01:01:01,833
I'm going to miss that
beautiful little thing.

443
01:01:02,005 --> 01:01:06,499
Well, at least I've got this check
to cheer me up.

444
01:01:06,676 --> 01:01:08,871
What's happ...?
What's happening?

445
01:01:09,312 --> 01:01:15,114
Why, that double-crosser! That crook!
He used disappearing ink.

446
01:01:15,452 --> 01:01:19,946
Do you know, if the opportunity arose...

447
01:01:20,123 --> 01:01:23,024
...to do him a disservice...

448
01:01:23,193 --> 01:01:26,924
...I might not be able to resist it.

449
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:34,969
The moon is beautiful tonight,
mon chérie.

450
01:01:35,138 --> 01:01:38,471
Oh, yes. So romantic.

451
01:01:38,975 --> 01:01:40,704
Step in here, my dear...

452
01:01:40,877 --> 01:01:45,041
...out of the chill night wind.

453
01:01:51,821 --> 01:01:54,483
What was it you wished
to tell me, Meowrice?

454
01:01:54,658 --> 01:01:59,493
Tonight I wish to speak
of love and marriage.

455
01:01:59,929 --> 01:02:03,023
You have thought of marriage,
haven't you?

456
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:05,759
Yes, I...

457
01:02:05,935 --> 01:02:08,495
- I suppose I have.
- Good.

458
01:02:08,672 --> 01:02:11,106
Then I know just the one for you.

459
01:02:11,341 --> 01:02:15,437
Here's his picture.
His name is Henry Phtt...

460
01:02:15,612 --> 01:02:19,708
...of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.

461
01:02:19,883 --> 01:02:23,580
You mean you want me to marry this...

462
01:02:23,753 --> 01:02:28,747
...fat, old...?
- You are as bright as you are pretty.

463
01:02:28,925 --> 01:02:31,257
So please get into the basket...

464
01:02:31,428 --> 01:02:35,228
...like a good little bride-to-be.

465
01:02:36,366 --> 01:02:39,233
- Who are they?
- Business associates, chérie.

466
01:02:39,402 --> 01:02:43,862
Just get into the basket, and you
won't have to look at them anymore.

467
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:47,532
Into the basket?
No! Oh, no!

468
01:02:47,811 --> 01:02:50,143
Yes! Oh, yes!

469
01:02:50,313 --> 01:02:53,714
You are going to Pittsburgh
to marry that rich American.

470
01:02:53,883 --> 01:02:58,616
Isn't that what you wanted?
Isn't that why you left the farm?

471
01:02:58,922 --> 01:03:01,652
Yes. I mean, no.

472
01:03:01,825 --> 01:03:03,349
I just...

473
01:03:03,526 --> 01:03:07,553
I just want Jaune Tom.

474
01:03:07,831 --> 01:03:13,736
Jaune Tom? You mean the world's
greatest mouser?

475
01:03:13,903 --> 01:03:17,703
Why, old Jaune Tom's
probably in Alaska about now.

476
01:03:17,874 --> 01:03:20,206
He is not. You're lying...

477
01:03:20,376 --> 01:03:22,936
...just like you did
about everything else.

478
01:03:23,113 --> 01:03:27,140
Call it a weakness.
Now get into the basket.

479
01:03:27,317 --> 01:03:31,549
No! I won't!
I'm not going to marry anybody!

480
01:03:41,931 --> 01:03:43,421
After her, boys!

481
01:04:01,451 --> 01:04:04,852
Don't let her fall!
I have already paid the postage.

482
01:04:45,829 --> 01:04:48,093
Come down from there,
Armond, you idiot.

483
01:04:48,264 --> 01:04:51,995
No time for second-story work tonight.

484
01:04:58,274 --> 01:05:03,211
Well, why didn't you say so,
you epithet?

485
01:05:11,888 --> 01:05:14,448
Well, do you see her?

486
01:05:14,624 --> 01:05:17,616
Hurry. Hurry!

487
01:05:18,027 --> 01:05:22,020
You fools. Don't you see
those paw prints?

488
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:26,928
This should be easy.

489
01:05:27,103 --> 01:05:28,365
Let's go.

490
01:05:57,333 --> 01:06:01,565
She's not down here.
Back the other way!

491
01:06:04,474 --> 01:06:05,566
There she goes!

492
01:06:19,889 --> 01:06:23,586
Get rid of that dog,
you bumbling idiots!

493
01:06:24,494 --> 01:06:26,621
Your whiskers tickle, cats.

494
01:06:26,796 --> 01:06:30,323
And since I can't stand
to be tickled by no cats...

495
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:34,266
...I'm gonna tear your tails off
and have them for breakfast.

496
01:06:34,437 --> 01:06:36,735
We understand your feelings, sir.

497
01:06:36,906 --> 01:06:39,773
Nothing like cats' tails for breakfast...

498
01:06:39,943 --> 01:06:42,776
...but back there,
among those barrels, is a...

499
01:06:48,785 --> 01:06:50,582
No! Please!

500
01:06:50,753 --> 01:06:52,721
Let's talk this over.

501
01:07:01,197 --> 01:07:05,395
After all I've done for you.
Taught you everything I know...

502
01:07:05,568 --> 01:07:11,268
...made you despicable scoundrels
beyond compare.

503
01:07:12,342 --> 01:07:16,972
And what happens? You meet
one little dog and I, Meowrice...

504
01:07:17,146 --> 01:07:21,207
...have to save your miserable,
worthless lives.

505
01:07:21,384 --> 01:07:25,343
Now, get out there and find Mewsette.

506
01:08:43,966 --> 01:08:47,094
Brave country, is it not, mes amis?

507
01:08:48,137 --> 01:08:51,504
This weather, she's a little
nippy for cats.

508
01:08:51,674 --> 01:08:54,837
You could call it "catnip weather."

509
01:08:55,011 --> 01:08:57,445
Catnip weather, no?

510
01:08:57,613 --> 01:09:01,811
No. Well, I am discouraged too.

511
01:09:01,984 --> 01:09:04,680
We come for gold, we find cold.

512
01:09:04,854 --> 01:09:06,651
I tell you what.

513
01:09:06,823 --> 01:09:08,984
Let's join the Foreign Legion.

514
01:09:09,158 --> 01:09:12,650
We go to Africa and get warm again, eh?

515
01:09:35,184 --> 01:09:38,051
Mon dieu! Little turtle, look!

516
01:09:38,221 --> 01:09:41,486
We've struck it rich!

517
01:09:43,192 --> 01:09:45,353
Jaune Tom, we're rich!

518
01:09:46,696 --> 01:09:48,220
We're rich!

519
01:09:48,397 --> 01:09:50,592
Wow!

520
01:09:52,135 --> 01:09:56,037
We're rich! Now we can go back.

521
01:10:18,761 --> 01:10:22,720
Six weeks. Six whole weeks lost.

522
01:10:23,099 --> 01:10:27,536
Never send kittens to do
a cat's job, I always say.

523
01:10:27,703 --> 01:10:32,606
And now that I'm getting
these splints off my tail...

524
01:10:34,443 --> 01:10:37,378
How are you, baby?

525
01:10:37,547 --> 01:10:40,209
Good as new?

526
01:10:41,317 --> 01:10:42,409
Now, then!

527
01:10:42,585 --> 01:10:45,076
We are going out and find Mewsette...

528
01:10:45,254 --> 01:10:50,317
...or there will be
four new violins in the world.

529
01:14:49,865 --> 01:14:53,323
Lovely view, eh, mademoiselle?

530
01:14:53,502 --> 01:14:57,029
Oh, no! Please!

531
01:15:16,792 --> 01:15:22,059
If there was any other way,
I would have waited, Jaune Tom.

532
01:15:30,072 --> 01:15:32,438
Nice fielding, team.

533
01:15:32,608 --> 01:15:36,635
Come along. We'll take
the scenic route home.

534
01:15:52,428 --> 01:15:56,524
The first thing we do is head for that
Madame what's her name's salon...

535
01:15:56,699 --> 01:15:59,361
...and they're bound to know
where she is.

536
01:15:59,535 --> 01:16:01,901
Come on, let's go.

537
01:16:09,411 --> 01:16:12,847
Don't worry, Jaune Tom,
I'm right behind you.

538
01:16:15,784 --> 01:16:18,014
There it is.

539
01:16:18,921 --> 01:16:21,515
- Where's Mewsette?
- She's in danger.

540
01:16:21,690 --> 01:16:24,523
- Yes, I know, but...
- They've taken her to Meowrice's...

541
01:16:24,693 --> 01:16:27,218
...and I think she's still there.
- Thanks a lot.

542
01:16:27,396 --> 01:16:30,365
- Yeah, thanks.
- Never mind the thanks.

543
01:16:30,533 --> 01:16:34,936
Just give Meowrice my love
and then turn him inside out.

544
01:16:35,104 --> 01:16:36,765
Now, hurry. Hurry!

545
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:44,040
Canned fish?

546
01:16:44,213 --> 01:16:47,842
What won't they think of next?

547
01:16:48,317 --> 01:16:51,775
Everything is packaged these days.

548
01:16:51,954 --> 01:16:54,684
Even pretty girls, hmm?

549
01:17:03,432 --> 01:17:04,694
What?

550
01:17:04,867 --> 01:17:08,234
Jaune Tom? The champion mouser?

551
01:17:11,173 --> 01:17:14,870
At Madame Rubens-Chatte's?

552
01:17:15,311 --> 01:17:17,871
Quick, then. We must be off to the train.

553
01:17:18,047 --> 01:17:21,016
Grab the handles.
Put your backs into it.

554
01:17:21,183 --> 01:17:23,913
Get moving, you idiots.

555
01:17:25,254 --> 01:17:29,122
All right, lads, the coast is clear.

556
01:17:39,702 --> 01:17:42,000
Let's go.

557
01:17:49,345 --> 01:17:50,710
Mewsette.

558
01:17:50,879 --> 01:17:52,938
Mewsette!

559
01:17:53,115 --> 01:17:54,673
Mewsette, where are you?

560
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:57,851
Don't worry, Jaune Tom,
I'll be right there.

561
01:18:00,689 --> 01:18:03,055
It's no use, Robespierre.

562
01:18:03,225 --> 01:18:04,692
We're too late.

563
01:18:04,893 --> 01:18:06,155
Nobody to...

564
01:18:07,162 --> 01:18:08,754
...with?

565
01:18:08,931 --> 01:18:11,661
Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Stop.

566
01:18:11,834 --> 01:18:13,495
Look. There's a message.

567
01:18:15,537 --> 01:18:20,406
"Jaune Tom, I'm being
taken to the train."

568
01:18:43,932 --> 01:18:46,833
Tears of gratitude, chérie?

569
01:18:47,002 --> 01:18:50,802
Just think, in a few hours,
you will be on a boat to America...

570
01:18:50,973 --> 01:18:56,275
...and your new, old, rich husband.

571
01:18:57,179 --> 01:19:00,774
Well, well, there are
your little friends...

572
01:19:00,949 --> 01:19:04,112
...down to bid you goodbye.

573
01:19:04,553 --> 01:19:07,420
What are we gonna do?

574
01:19:07,589 --> 01:19:10,456
I'm too pooped.

575
01:19:10,626 --> 01:19:12,594
Au revoir, my children.

576
01:19:12,761 --> 01:19:16,128
Don't forget to write.

577
01:19:16,932 --> 01:19:18,832
Hey. Hey, maybe if I...

578
01:19:19,001 --> 01:19:21,469
Maybe if I imagine...

579
01:19:44,326 --> 01:19:45,623
Mewsette?

580
01:19:45,794 --> 01:19:49,230
- Mewsette, where are you?
- Jaune Tom!

581
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:53,165
Good work, gentlemen.

582
01:20:04,747 --> 01:20:08,274
Stop him, someone.

583
01:20:14,857 --> 01:20:20,693
Toss him out the door, boys.
He ought to make quite a splash.

584
01:20:20,863 --> 01:20:22,558
Jaune Tom, help!

585
01:20:22,731 --> 01:20:25,495
They've got Robespierre!

586
01:20:25,667 --> 01:20:27,430
Too late, my dear.

587
01:20:58,133 --> 01:21:00,693
Are you all right, Mewsette?
You look all right.

588
01:21:00,869 --> 01:21:03,303
I mean, at least your eyes do.

589
01:21:03,472 --> 01:21:07,374
If you'll let me out now, Jaune Tom,
I'll show you how I really look.

590
01:21:07,676 --> 01:21:11,043
Sure, sure.
What's the matter with me anyway?

591
01:21:11,213 --> 01:21:13,875
It doesn't really matter, though.

592
01:21:19,888 --> 01:21:24,552
Why, Jaune Tom, that's the nicest
thing anybody ever said to me.

593
01:21:24,827 --> 01:21:29,423
Jaune Tom, I've been such a fool.

594
01:21:35,871 --> 01:21:37,361
Jaune Tom, look out!

595
01:21:48,917 --> 01:21:51,943
You keep out of it, Robespierre.

596
01:22:35,497 --> 01:22:37,761
Jaune Tom, hold it!

597
01:22:37,933 --> 01:22:39,628
Stop.

598
01:22:41,003 --> 01:22:43,494
"Mr. Henry Phtt.

599
01:22:43,672 --> 01:22:47,438
1411 Sand Box Road."

600
01:22:48,176 --> 01:22:51,077
Oh, yes.
Good idea, Robespierre.

601
01:22:51,246 --> 01:22:53,737
Now, you go to beddy-bye,
and when you wake up...

602
01:22:53,916 --> 01:22:57,477
...you'll be on a boat
going to meet that rich husband.

603
01:22:57,653 --> 01:22:59,382
Right, Robespierre?

604
01:22:59,554 --> 01:23:02,523
Please. Please don't say
anything more. I'm dying.

605
01:23:02,691 --> 01:23:05,421
I'm dying, I tell you!

606
01:24:53,335 --> 01:24:54,324
