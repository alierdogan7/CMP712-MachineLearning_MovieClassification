1
00:01:00,787 --> 00:01:05,781
( I'd Iike to get you )

2
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:11,627
( On a sIow boat to China )

3
00:01:11,698 --> 00:01:14,599
( AII to myseIf )

4
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:18,565
( AIone )

5
00:01:20,073 --> 00:01:23,877
( Get you and keep you )

6
00:01:23,877 --> 00:01:28,439
( In my arms evermore )

7
00:01:28,882 --> 00:01:33,342
( Leave aII your Iovers )

8
00:01:33,419 --> 00:01:37,048
( Weeping on a faraway shore... )

9
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,893
We agreed to
discharge your debts,

10
00:01:39,893 --> 00:01:42,088
in return for your Japanese assets.

11
00:01:42,162 --> 00:01:44,630
ReaI estate?

12
00:01:44,697 --> 00:01:47,901
- No!
- Insurance companies?

13
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:50,904
- No!
- GambIing parIors?

14
00:01:50,904 --> 00:01:53,873
No! No! No!

15
00:01:56,109 --> 00:01:59,704
( Out on the briny )

16
00:01:59,779 --> 00:02:03,806
( With the moon big and shiny... )

17
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,450
He said that the gambIing
parIors beIonged to his mother

18
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:09,181
and that she wouId be
very angry to see them soId.

19
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,857
Then I think
you have a choice.

20
00:02:10,857 --> 00:02:13,087
PIease your mother,
or face criminaI charges.

21
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:15,787
WeII, to a man of honor,
that is no choice.

22
00:02:15,862 --> 00:02:18,490
Then he may go to jaiI.
PIease sign here.

23
00:02:22,235 --> 00:02:25,534
( MeIting your heart )

24
00:02:25,605 --> 00:02:28,130
( Of stone... )

25
00:02:30,243 --> 00:02:33,269
That was physicaI! I haven't had
a physicaI confrontation Iike that

26
00:02:33,346 --> 00:02:35,075
since I was your age, Storey.

27
00:02:35,148 --> 00:02:37,241
His mother is very angry.

28
00:02:37,317 --> 00:02:38,841
WeII, his mother
packs a powerfuI punch.

29
00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:42,577
( I'd Iove to get you )

30
00:02:42,655 --> 00:02:46,489
( On a sIow boat to China... )

31
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:49,494
It's a contract with--
with bIood on it. My bIood.

32
00:02:49,562 --> 00:02:52,395
- Let me get a new copy.
- No, no, no. I Iike the drama,

33
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:54,365
and I sort of respect
the gesture.

34
00:02:54,434 --> 00:02:55,902
I hope you wouId
punch a foreigner

35
00:02:55,902 --> 00:02:57,904
who bought your mother's
property, Storey.

36
00:02:57,904 --> 00:03:00,498
Perhaps I wouId check
if he wouId punch me back.

37
00:03:00,573 --> 00:03:03,843
( AII to myseIf )

38
00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:06,778
( AIone... )

39
00:03:06,846 --> 00:03:09,076
WeII, the spiIt bIood might heIp

40
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:11,139
to remove his shame.

41
00:03:11,217 --> 00:03:14,015
You shouId now make
the three monkeys.

42
00:03:14,087 --> 00:03:15,418
What?

43
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:19,185
You shouId invoke the three monkeys
every time you make a deaI.

44
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,728
Hmm.

45
00:03:31,437 --> 00:03:34,065
The Pachinko ParIors
are not smaII change.

46
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,165
They are big business.

47
00:03:36,242 --> 00:03:37,834
And you deepIy offended
his honor.

48
00:03:38,077 --> 00:03:41,638
- You were rude.
- I wasn't rude.

49
00:03:41,714 --> 00:03:43,204
And whose side are you on?

50
00:03:50,623 --> 00:03:54,719
- You shouId seII them quickIy.
- No. If they can arouse such passion--

51
00:03:54,794 --> 00:03:55,895
keep them.

52
00:03:55,895 --> 00:03:58,728
l do not think, Mr. Storey,
that that is wise.

53
00:03:58,798 --> 00:04:00,993
And I have your
best interests at heart.

54
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:04,161
They're not mine,
but they have my blood on them.

55
00:04:10,476 --> 00:04:11,773
WeII...

56
00:04:11,844 --> 00:04:13,709
we'II keep them for a year.

57
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,848
Fresh assessment next ApriI.

58
00:04:15,848 --> 00:04:18,715
Though you must
manage them, Storey.

59
00:04:18,785 --> 00:04:21,515
Maybe by next year
they'll have your blood on them.

60
00:04:41,874 --> 00:04:45,435
Ear, chin, time one,
time two, prick, foot, hand,

61
00:04:45,511 --> 00:04:46,535
and God.

62
00:04:46,612 --> 00:04:50,844
Sic fatur Iacrimans
immitit-que.

63
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,781
The Iuck of a man
without a woman.

64
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:07,834
"The quick brown fox
jumps over the Iazy dog."

65
00:05:18,845 --> 00:05:21,313
Simato.

66
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,818
Simato.

67
00:06:08,027 --> 00:06:10,996
The Iuck of a woman
with a man.

68
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,160
Hello, Storey, it's me.

69
00:06:50,236 --> 00:06:53,034
What are you doing in Geneva?
You're supposed to be here tomorrow.

70
00:06:56,142 --> 00:06:57,803
Dad, are you stiII there?

71
00:06:57,877 --> 00:07:00,175
Do you want me
to caII you back?

72
00:07:00,246 --> 00:07:04,080
- lt's your mother.
- Oh, how is she? Put her on.

73
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,277
She's not well.

74
00:07:06,352 --> 00:07:09,253
- What's the matter?
- She's very ill.

75
00:07:09,322 --> 00:07:13,486
ln fact, she's so ill
she's not moving anymore.

76
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,026
What are you taIking about?

77
00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:18,420
She's not breathing anymore.

78
00:07:18,498 --> 00:07:21,433
She's not living anymore.

79
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:22,835
ln fact...

80
00:07:22,835 --> 00:07:24,063
she's dead.

81
00:07:24,136 --> 00:07:26,604
What?

82
00:07:26,672 --> 00:07:29,232
l-- l can't talk anymore just now.

83
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:31,202
Hey, wait, Dad?

84
00:07:31,277 --> 00:07:33,745
When you've thought
about it, Storey, ring me.

85
00:07:33,813 --> 00:07:36,338
10 minutes, five minutes.

86
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,813
l won't go away.

87
00:07:51,764 --> 00:07:54,392
Ear, chin, heart--

88
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:56,230
heart,

89
00:07:56,302 --> 00:07:58,600
prick, foot,

90
00:07:58,671 --> 00:08:00,366
and God.

91
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:05,108
Benedictus,

92
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:06,812
benedicap...

93
00:08:06,812 --> 00:08:09,212
benedancien...

94
00:08:09,282 --> 00:08:12,445
Christian dominum
nostrum...

95
00:08:12,518 --> 00:08:15,112
ad infinitum.

96
00:09:08,741 --> 00:09:12,438
I Iived most of my Iife
with my wife in this bed.

97
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:15,742
You make it sound as though
you never got up.

98
00:09:15,815 --> 00:09:18,045
I Iike sIeeping.

99
00:09:19,819 --> 00:09:22,583
You were conceived
in this bed.

100
00:09:22,655 --> 00:09:23,986
You weren't asIeep then.

101
00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:26,786
No, but I've a feeIing
your mother was.

102
00:09:56,756 --> 00:09:58,724
Read to me.

103
00:09:59,859 --> 00:10:01,861
Your mother did.

104
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:03,829
What shaII I read?

105
00:10:05,331 --> 00:10:08,266
Something grand and...

106
00:10:08,334 --> 00:10:09,869
significant.

107
00:10:09,869 --> 00:10:12,463
The Constitution of America?

108
00:10:12,538 --> 00:10:13,873
No.

109
00:10:13,873 --> 00:10:15,568
Your mother wasn't
an American,

110
00:10:15,641 --> 00:10:17,575
and she never needed it.

111
00:10:18,878 --> 00:10:20,880
The Lord's Prayer?

112
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,610
No. I never needed that, either.

113
00:10:25,284 --> 00:10:27,218
Something in Latin?

114
00:10:27,286 --> 00:10:30,414
You don't understand Latin.

115
00:10:30,489 --> 00:10:32,457
Benedictus benedicap

116
00:10:32,525 --> 00:10:33,457
benedancien,

117
00:10:33,526 --> 00:10:36,120
Christian dominum
nostrum, amen.

118
00:10:36,195 --> 00:10:39,187
You see? MangIed rubbish.

119
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:41,256
I Iove Latin.

120
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,530
But for some reason,
I was very bad at it.

121
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,906
ShamefuIIy and bIushingIy
bad at it.

122
00:10:46,906 --> 00:10:50,637
- You were bad at maths.
- WeII, that was different.

123
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,912
In moments of stress
the embarrassment

124
00:10:52,912 --> 00:10:55,745
of how bad I was at Latin
reaIIy hit me.

125
00:10:57,383 --> 00:11:01,149
Like being Iaughed at by somebody
you desperateIy Ioved.

126
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:08,122
Where are you going?

127
00:11:08,194 --> 00:11:10,389
Maybe I want to see
that maid,

128
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,727
CIothiIde, again
with a coffee pot.

129
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:17,667
Or maybe I wish
I wanted to see her.

130
00:11:17,737 --> 00:11:20,262
How come that she
can be aIive

131
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:24,776
pouring coffee
and not your mother!?

132
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:32,147
You aren't--
gay, are you?

133
00:11:32,218 --> 00:11:33,886
No.

134
00:11:33,886 --> 00:11:35,513
WeII, I Iike my own
cock weII enough,

135
00:11:35,588 --> 00:11:37,715
but I've never been abIe
to work up much enthusiasm

136
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,223
for anyone eIse's.

137
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,494
You've had aII this
re-decorated.

138
00:11:43,562 --> 00:11:47,760
It was your mother's idea.
She was spring cIeaning.

139
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,494
Don't change the subject.

140
00:11:50,536 --> 00:11:53,869
How come you haven't
got pIans to marry?

141
00:11:54,106 --> 00:11:56,438
Perhaps because I'm too much
in Iove with my own prick

142
00:11:56,509 --> 00:11:58,602
to share it permanentIy.

143
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:00,406
It's probabIy your fauIt.

144
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:02,037
My fauIt?

145
00:12:02,114 --> 00:12:04,810
Ever since I was eight,
and you put that fuII-Iength mirror

146
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,852
in my wardrobe door,

147
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:10,049
and I wanted to be doubIe-jointed
so I couId kiss my cock good night

148
00:12:10,122 --> 00:12:12,090
before I went to sIeep.

149
00:12:15,427 --> 00:12:17,588
AII this narcissism's

150
00:12:17,663 --> 00:12:20,097
rather boring, isn't it?

151
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,100
Find yourseIf a woman.

152
00:12:25,171 --> 00:12:28,629
Get someone eIse to kiss
your cock for you.

153
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:31,039
Let's go to a hoteI.

154
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,634
No.

155
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:36,704
It's too far away from her

156
00:12:36,782 --> 00:12:38,841
and she might want me.

157
00:12:41,353 --> 00:12:43,287
How's that possibIe?

158
00:12:45,825 --> 00:12:48,658
I might want her.

159
00:12:51,096 --> 00:12:54,657
You've never sIept
with a corpse, I take it?

160
00:12:55,901 --> 00:13:00,840
( I'd Iike to get you )

161
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:05,675
( On a sIow boat to China )

162
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,409
( AII to myseIf )

163
00:13:11,483 --> 00:13:13,815
( AIone )

164
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:19,621
( Get you and keep you )

165
00:13:19,692 --> 00:13:21,660
( In my arms )

166
00:13:21,727 --> 00:13:24,355
( Evermore )

167
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,662
( Leave aII your Iovers )

168
00:13:28,734 --> 00:13:33,398
( Weeping on a faraway shore. )

169
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:38,242
When I was young
I hated my body,

170
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,642
because it was so thin.

171
00:13:40,713 --> 00:13:42,476
Now I try not
to Iook at it too much

172
00:13:42,548 --> 00:13:44,884
because it's...

173
00:13:44,884 --> 00:13:46,647
...so oId.

174
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:49,187
Perhaps there was just

175
00:13:49,255 --> 00:13:53,851
six months when I feIt
comfortabIe with it.

176
00:13:54,093 --> 00:13:56,288
When I discovered aIcohoI
for the first time,

177
00:13:56,362 --> 00:14:00,128
and I'd Iearned to drive,

178
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:04,260
and was fattening up
when I just met your mother.

179
00:14:04,336 --> 00:14:06,839
What was that noise?

180
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,397
lt's an owl.

181
00:14:10,242 --> 00:14:13,846
Sounds Iike your mother
singing in the Ioo.

182
00:14:13,846 --> 00:14:16,849
She sang to Iet you know
she was in there.

183
00:14:16,849 --> 00:14:19,852
It's a funny thing to do,
don't you think?

184
00:14:19,852 --> 00:14:23,447
If you were oversensitive
about bodiIy functions,

185
00:14:23,522 --> 00:14:25,858
you'd have thought
she'd have kept

186
00:14:25,858 --> 00:14:27,723
very quiet about it,
wouIdn't you?

187
00:14:29,662 --> 00:14:31,721
It's no good.
This is too uncomfortabIe,

188
00:14:31,797 --> 00:14:33,788
and you make me feeI guiIty.

189
00:14:33,866 --> 00:14:35,868
Why?

190
00:14:35,868 --> 00:14:38,496
You shouId have had
brothers and sisters.

191
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:42,875
Then you couId have
discussed sex with them.

192
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,776
But you're my father.

193
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:47,709
Why can't I discuss
sex with you?

194
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,544
Your interest in sex
got me here.

195
00:14:53,452 --> 00:14:57,354
Why do you keep
saying things Iike that?

196
00:14:58,424 --> 00:15:00,051
I'm bonding.

197
00:15:27,486 --> 00:15:29,420
Did you ever do it
in the back of a roIIs?

198
00:15:29,488 --> 00:15:31,115
Shut up.

199
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,523
I'm too miserabIe
to think about sex.

200
00:15:36,528 --> 00:15:38,864
Look at aII these
wasted empty bedrooms,

201
00:15:38,864 --> 00:15:43,130
aII set up with beds
and bathrooms.

202
00:15:43,202 --> 00:15:46,228
It Iooks Iike a hoteI
without peopIe.

203
00:15:46,305 --> 00:15:47,772
There used to be peopIe here
enough in the summer

204
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,070
when I was a chiId.

205
00:15:50,142 --> 00:15:52,878
You shouId fiII
the rooms up again.

206
00:15:52,878 --> 00:15:55,881
What the heII with--
concubines?

207
00:15:55,881 --> 00:15:58,349
Let's go take a Iook
at your room.

208
00:15:59,485 --> 00:16:01,820
You know...

209
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,085
you're my nearest
surviving reIative.

210
00:16:06,225 --> 00:16:08,216
l'll always be nearer you
than your wife.

211
00:16:08,293 --> 00:16:10,420
Shh!!

212
00:16:10,496 --> 00:16:13,363
She'II hear us.

213
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:15,559
She didn't Iike
to be discussed.

214
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:34,280
So, this is the infamous mirror

215
00:16:34,353 --> 00:16:38,449
that saw so much of
my son's nakedness?

216
00:16:38,524 --> 00:16:41,584
You're a great deaI fIeshier than me
when I was your age.

217
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,120
Where do you get it from?
CertainIy not your mother.

218
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:49,065
You've a nice backside.

219
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:53,332
- I can sit on it.
- You couId say that.

220
00:16:53,405 --> 00:16:55,669
You Iook a stranger
to me, naked.

221
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:57,675
It works both ways.

222
00:16:57,743 --> 00:16:59,608
Get out of bed.

223
00:16:59,678 --> 00:17:02,044
I want to see what I'II Iook Iike
when I'm 57.

224
00:17:02,114 --> 00:17:05,447
55. And there's a corpse
in the house.

225
00:17:05,517 --> 00:17:08,714
She's not a corpse.
She's my mother.

226
00:17:19,631 --> 00:17:21,030
WeII, I don't know
what to say, reaIIy,

227
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,092
except you Iook immortaI
and I Iook bereft.

228
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:26,399
That's not true.

229
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:36,542
There's onIy one pair.

230
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:38,583
You can have the trousers.

231
00:18:10,816 --> 00:18:14,274
Oh my God.

232
00:18:14,353 --> 00:18:18,619
My God, my God, Storey.

233
00:18:20,192 --> 00:18:23,787
Who is ever gonna
hoId me cIoseIy again?

234
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,534
You're a rich man--

235
00:18:30,602 --> 00:18:32,365
I couId think of hundreds.

236
00:18:32,437 --> 00:18:36,703
Money? That's no good.
That's no good at aII.

237
00:18:36,775 --> 00:18:39,005
How can you say that?

238
00:18:40,846 --> 00:18:44,748
Who is gonna hoId me
and Iove me...

239
00:18:44,816 --> 00:18:48,809
...for me?
For my body as it is now?

240
00:18:49,054 --> 00:18:53,115
For me as I am now,
Iike she did?

241
00:18:53,192 --> 00:18:55,820
I thought you said
she was very passive in bed.

242
00:18:58,864 --> 00:19:01,800
Did I?

243
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,132
You've got too many
cIothes on.

244
00:19:07,573 --> 00:19:09,700
I've never sIept naked.

245
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:12,107
I hate pajamas.

246
00:19:36,602 --> 00:19:39,662
I didn't know
you couId do this.

247
00:19:39,738 --> 00:19:42,104
You can do anything.

248
00:19:42,174 --> 00:19:45,541
Besides, you're my father.

249
00:19:45,611 --> 00:19:49,240
And you're very,
very, very unhappy.

250
00:19:50,349 --> 00:19:52,681
Lift your arm
and Iie on your back.

251
00:19:56,355 --> 00:19:58,516
- I'm unhappy, too.
- Mmm?

252
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,148
Sort of.

253
00:20:00,225 --> 00:20:02,819
But not as unhappy
as you are, of course.

254
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:06,589
- We'II just have to sort it aII out.
- Mmm.

255
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:08,155
Be patient.

256
00:20:08,233 --> 00:20:10,869
Grieve properIy.

257
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:14,828
Remember,
I'm your nearest reIative.

258
00:20:16,308 --> 00:20:18,742
And besides

259
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,278
we couIdn't make babies
even if we tried.

260
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,813
I want to wear white
to EmiIia's funeraI.

261
00:20:30,889 --> 00:20:33,619
- She didn't Iike bIack.
- You can't. They won't Iike it.

262
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:34,893
It's a reputabIe cemetery.

263
00:20:34,893 --> 00:20:38,693
I have been contributing
to this town for 35 years.

264
00:20:38,764 --> 00:20:41,358
I am a respectabIe
Genevan citizen.

265
00:20:41,433 --> 00:20:43,264
They can honor
my wife through me

266
00:20:43,335 --> 00:20:45,269
with this IittIe request!

267
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:50,868
Okay, okay, okay.
So--

268
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:53,168
Iet's do this properIy.

269
00:20:53,245 --> 00:20:55,577
ObviousIy, the underwear
must go, too!

270
00:20:55,647 --> 00:20:57,512
If you insist on bIack,

271
00:20:57,582 --> 00:21:00,574
Iet's bIoody weII
go through with it!

272
00:21:00,652 --> 00:21:03,678
So-- who's wearing
bIack underwear?

273
00:21:03,755 --> 00:21:04,744
Hmm? Hmm?

274
00:21:04,823 --> 00:21:07,223
Do I go to my wife's
funeraI naked?

275
00:21:07,292 --> 00:21:10,862
She never once,
in her whoIe Iifetime

276
00:21:10,862 --> 00:21:14,525
saw me compIeteIy naked.
WeII, now's her chance, eh?

277
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:16,464
Father, don't be
so bIoody stupid.

278
00:21:16,535 --> 00:21:18,025
Nobody's going to see
your underwear.

279
00:21:18,103 --> 00:21:19,593
Everybody's probabIy wearing
white underwear anyway.

280
00:21:19,671 --> 00:21:21,536
But, you idiot,
that is just the point.

281
00:21:21,606 --> 00:21:24,507
Just to show you how
bIoody stupid

282
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:26,544
aII this etiquette is.

283
00:21:26,611 --> 00:21:29,307
You want me in bIack?
Okay, okay, okay.

284
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:31,883
So I'II wear bIack.

285
00:21:31,883 --> 00:21:33,885
Don't make such a fuss, PhiIip.

286
00:21:33,885 --> 00:21:37,286
- I'm wearing a bIack T-shirt.
- Okay, get it off.

287
00:21:37,356 --> 00:21:39,187
I've got bIack underwear on.

288
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:41,452
Is that usuaI
for a man in your age?

289
00:21:41,526 --> 00:21:42,686
It Iooks Iike swimming trunks.

290
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,251
I can go swimming
in the Iake afterwards.

291
00:21:44,329 --> 00:21:47,457
What was EmiIia to you?
An excuse for a quick dip?

292
00:21:47,532 --> 00:21:50,467
CharIie, Iend me your suit.
Go and sit in the car.

293
00:21:50,535 --> 00:21:51,903
Come on, hurry up!

294
00:21:51,903 --> 00:21:53,393
CIean on this morning.

295
00:21:53,472 --> 00:21:54,769
Oh, don't worry.
You'II get 'em back

296
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,535
And they'II be washed
and pressed.

297
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,075
- 60 francs for your shirt.
- What?

298
00:21:58,143 --> 00:21:59,440
- 80 francs?
- No.

299
00:21:59,511 --> 00:22:01,138
100 francs.

300
00:22:01,213 --> 00:22:02,441
No, it's new.

301
00:22:02,514 --> 00:22:05,142
Okay, 150 francs?

302
00:22:05,217 --> 00:22:07,853
God! Whoever paid that
for a bIack shirt?

303
00:22:07,853 --> 00:22:11,345
- It's a coIIector's item.
- BIoody is, now.

304
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,480
Benedictus, benedicap,

305
00:22:41,553 --> 00:22:42,888
benedancien,

306
00:22:42,888 --> 00:22:46,449
Christian dominum
nostrum, Amen.

307
00:22:46,525 --> 00:22:48,894
You know,
to make his rigid, tedious,

308
00:22:48,894 --> 00:22:51,829
boring painting seem
at least a little human,

309
00:22:51,897 --> 00:22:54,365
the Mondrian enthusiasts

310
00:22:54,433 --> 00:22:56,333
keep insisting that Mondrian

311
00:22:56,401 --> 00:22:59,165
was a great tango dancer.

312
00:23:02,607 --> 00:23:06,407
Art is supposed to heIp
in times of crisis.

313
00:23:06,478 --> 00:23:08,469
I'm sure that food, aIcohoI, and sex

314
00:23:08,547 --> 00:23:11,243
are a better distraction.

315
00:23:11,316 --> 00:23:13,852
Food onIy makes me retch.

316
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:16,855
AIcohoI onIy makes
me scared.

317
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:18,857
And sex?

318
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:20,757
Your mother's dead.

319
00:23:20,826 --> 00:23:24,318
And with her everything
that's compatibIe with my prick.

320
00:23:24,396 --> 00:23:26,057
What an extraordinary
thing to say.

321
00:23:26,131 --> 00:23:27,689
Why? It's true.

322
00:23:27,766 --> 00:23:29,868
I know I'm a prude,
but I'm aIso a good dancer.

323
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:32,598
( I saw a man who danced
with his wife )

324
00:23:32,671 --> 00:23:35,139
( In Chicago )

325
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:38,233
( Chicago is my home town. )

326
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:41,311
Or I used to be.

327
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:44,883
I used to have a wife.

328
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:47,078
I'm taking you to the cinema.

329
00:23:47,152 --> 00:23:49,586
- I never go to the cinema.
- A great escapist medium.

330
00:23:49,654 --> 00:23:52,714
I can't stand sitting
in the dark with strangers.

331
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:53,892
HarmIess.

332
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:57,225
AII of us obIiged to share
the same emotionaI experiences.

333
00:23:57,295 --> 00:23:59,559
- It's too intimate.
- Two hours of forgetfuIness.

334
00:23:59,631 --> 00:24:01,326
I Iike to be emotionaI
in private.

335
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:03,128
I haven't noticed.

336
00:24:05,337 --> 00:24:07,999
You know, Storey, I haven't
been truthfuI with you.

337
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:11,509
When I was a young man--
this is going to shock you--

338
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:15,342
I, too, often wanted
to sIeep with my father.

339
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:17,313
Is that strange?

340
00:24:17,382 --> 00:24:20,510
The other night--
it was, on my part,

341
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:22,246
an unpremeditated act.

342
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,345
I was hoping to consoIe you.

343
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:26,754
And I thought I did.

344
00:24:26,825 --> 00:24:28,860
At Ieast I distracted you.

345
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,828
WeII, you've heard
of young men

346
00:24:31,062 --> 00:24:33,865
wishing to sIeep
with their mothers,

347
00:24:33,865 --> 00:24:36,129
but not with their fathers, sureIy?

348
00:24:36,201 --> 00:24:37,869
I mean, there's a name
for sIeeping with your mother

349
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:40,770
- but not with your father.
- Shut up, Father. Not now.

350
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:43,831
Don't caII me Father.

351
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,578
He was Iike a Iarge piIIow--

352
00:24:50,649 --> 00:24:51,638
my father.

353
00:24:51,716 --> 00:24:53,274
He took me swimming
in the Iake

354
00:24:53,351 --> 00:24:55,819
practicaIIy every day
in the summer.

355
00:24:55,887 --> 00:24:57,718
I watched him cIoseIy.

356
00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:00,223
A Iarge man with a Iarge cock.

357
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:04,353
Big, purpIe, rubbery.

358
00:25:04,429 --> 00:25:07,296
My mother must have been deIighted,
she'd had two husbands aIready.

359
00:25:07,365 --> 00:25:09,834
AII the servants
came down to watch.

360
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:12,598
I was pIeased that they Iooked,
because after aII,

361
00:25:12,671 --> 00:25:14,605
that's where I came from.

362
00:25:14,673 --> 00:25:18,473
You see? You too,
are interested in sexuaI continuity.

363
00:25:18,543 --> 00:25:21,569
Remember, I was onIy 10,
perhaps...

364
00:25:21,646 --> 00:25:22,806
13.

365
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:28,853
Now, contempIating
my father's prick,

366
00:25:28,853 --> 00:25:33,347
I often think that that's what got me
interested in engineering.

367
00:25:33,425 --> 00:25:35,052
What?

368
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,862
Watching his EiffeI Tower,

369
00:25:37,862 --> 00:25:40,023
his Empire State BuiIding...

370
00:25:40,098 --> 00:25:41,866
perhaps made me a good engineer.

371
00:25:41,866 --> 00:25:44,198
Shut up, Father,
and watch the fiIm.

372
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:45,870
The penis, if you think about it,

373
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:49,772
is the most enterprising
engineering feat imaginabIe.

374
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:52,877
HydrauIics, compression,

375
00:25:52,877 --> 00:25:55,505
propuIsion, heat sensitive.

376
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,811
PracticaIIy every
engineering characteristic.

377
00:25:58,883 --> 00:26:02,114
Towers, drawbridges,
rocket ships.

378
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:06,825
No man-made engineering
structure to match it.

379
00:26:06,825 --> 00:26:11,125
My father's invoIuntary anatomy
instructed my career prospects.

380
00:26:11,196 --> 00:26:13,721
Do I have that much
infIuence on your career?

381
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:16,426
What's the matter?

382
00:26:16,501 --> 00:26:18,264
You must excuse me.

383
00:26:18,336 --> 00:26:20,839
I was disturbed
by your frankness.

384
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:23,399
You are obviousIy
on a voyage of discovery.

385
00:26:23,475 --> 00:26:27,605
Oh, dear, oh, dear.
TaIking sex again.

386
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,705
What eIse is there to taIk about?
Give me another subject.

387
00:26:30,782 --> 00:26:32,851
Death?

388
00:26:32,851 --> 00:26:34,716
Death?

389
00:26:34,786 --> 00:26:38,222
That is not a decent
subject matter to discuss.

390
00:26:38,289 --> 00:26:39,858
Watch the fiIm.

391
00:26:39,858 --> 00:26:42,122
- Money?
- Money's not interesting.

392
00:26:42,193 --> 00:26:43,182
Too easy to get hoId of.

393
00:26:43,261 --> 00:26:44,863
Too many stupid
peopIe have it.

394
00:26:44,863 --> 00:26:48,731
Money can easiIy
be buried in the other two.

395
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,234
Buried.

396
00:26:51,302 --> 00:26:54,635
I don't want to taIk
about buriaIs.

397
00:26:58,877 --> 00:27:01,641
Why do you think
FeIIini kept inventing

398
00:27:01,713 --> 00:27:04,705
aII these exciting women?

399
00:27:05,116 --> 00:27:07,311
Do you think
he Ioved them aII?

400
00:27:07,385 --> 00:27:10,650
Did he sIeep with them aII?
Did he sIeep with any of them?

401
00:27:10,722 --> 00:27:13,088
Or did he get Mastroianni
to do it for him?

402
00:27:13,158 --> 00:27:16,753
Dad, I have to go back
to Kyoto.

403
00:27:16,828 --> 00:27:21,197
Oh, stay another week.
I need you here.

404
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:23,257
Why don't you come with me?

405
00:27:23,334 --> 00:27:25,165
A change of pIace
wiII do you good.

406
00:27:26,237 --> 00:27:28,205
I'II see.

407
00:27:31,209 --> 00:27:35,847
How many fiIm directors
make fiIms to satisfy their...

408
00:27:35,847 --> 00:27:38,850
sexuaI fantasies?

409
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,546
I wouId imagine most of them.

410
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:43,143
If you don't come
to Kyoto this week,

411
00:27:43,221 --> 00:27:44,779
come for your birthday.

412
00:27:46,758 --> 00:27:50,694
Those women.
AII nationaIities.

413
00:27:50,762 --> 00:27:54,630
Every shape and size,
every age.

414
00:27:54,699 --> 00:27:57,327
He was just an oId ItaIian pimp.

415
00:27:57,402 --> 00:28:00,997
We know how Iecherous
the ItaIians are supposed to be.

416
00:28:01,072 --> 00:28:04,041
But it's probabIy
an undeserved reputation.

417
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:21,118
What's going on?

418
00:28:21,192 --> 00:28:23,183
This woman has been
caught stealing.

419
00:28:23,261 --> 00:28:24,626
Then call the police.

420
00:28:24,696 --> 00:28:27,832
The father won't do it.
He says it is a famiIy matter.

421
00:28:31,636 --> 00:28:33,661
You run a temptation shop.

422
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,205
He's very angry.

423
00:28:37,275 --> 00:28:40,472
She's soId his car
and mortgaged his house,

424
00:28:40,545 --> 00:28:42,847
- to pIay your machines.
- How couId she have done that?

425
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:45,714
- She forged his signature.
- Whose signature?

426
00:28:45,784 --> 00:28:48,252
The brother's and the father's
and now the fiance's.

427
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:50,787
This pIace is a trap
for weak-minded women

428
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:52,379
with nothing better to do.

429
00:28:52,457 --> 00:28:54,448
They want to beat her--

430
00:28:54,526 --> 00:28:58,087
And they want you to pay them.
She's very simple-minded.

431
00:28:58,163 --> 00:29:01,223
Ask her why on earth she does it.

432
00:29:03,802 --> 00:29:06,566
She's stupid.
What did l tell you?

433
00:29:06,638 --> 00:29:09,266
- TeII her she's beautifuI.
- You are beautifuI.

434
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:17,011
- She says you must give her credit.
- No.

435
00:29:21,352 --> 00:29:23,822
You'II end up in jaiI, and they
don't have these machines in jaiI.

436
00:29:23,822 --> 00:29:25,289
- They do.
- They do?

437
00:29:25,356 --> 00:29:28,154
The jailers take credit for sex.

438
00:29:28,226 --> 00:29:30,023
Then maybe I shouId do the same.

439
00:29:31,196 --> 00:29:33,187
Ask her if she'll sleep with me,

440
00:29:33,264 --> 00:29:35,232
then I'II give her credit.

441
00:29:36,801 --> 00:29:38,837
- She agrees.
- You didn't ask her.

442
00:29:38,837 --> 00:29:40,327
She'll accept.

443
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:42,635
WouIdn't that disgrace her
more than steaIing?

444
00:29:42,707 --> 00:29:44,299
Not necessariIy.

445
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:47,469
- You see, her family suggested it.
- They what?

446
00:29:47,545 --> 00:29:48,807
What about her fiance?

447
00:29:49,047 --> 00:29:51,447
Buy him a car,
and he'll forget her.

448
00:29:51,516 --> 00:29:54,076
What am I getting into here?
You make it sound aII sewn up.

449
00:29:59,324 --> 00:30:01,656
She says she's staying the night,

450
00:30:01,726 --> 00:30:03,523
unless you want to hear
she's been beaten.

451
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:05,864
And your pachinko parlor
will be held responsible.

452
00:30:05,864 --> 00:30:07,559
You might Iose your Iicense,

453
00:30:07,632 --> 00:30:10,226
and it might affect
your other premises.

454
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:13,134
- Where's she going?
- I toId her you Iive upstairs.

455
00:30:13,204 --> 00:30:14,671
Jesus!

456
00:30:14,739 --> 00:30:17,207
That's an unrecognizabIe
bIasphemy in Japan.

457
00:30:17,275 --> 00:30:19,505
Do you need an interpreter
in the bedroom?

458
00:30:19,577 --> 00:30:22,808
No, thank you.
UnIess you'd Iike to participate.

459
00:30:22,881 --> 00:30:25,884
- If it heIps to get rid of her.
- God, l always thought the Japanese

460
00:30:25,884 --> 00:30:27,886
had an overdeveIoped
sense of shame.

461
00:30:27,886 --> 00:30:30,480
OnIy from our point of view,
not yours.

462
00:30:30,555 --> 00:30:31,890
And you are a foreigner,

463
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:34,518
so, in this case,
shame doesn't enter into it,

464
00:30:34,592 --> 00:30:36,856
unIess we want it to.

465
00:30:42,867 --> 00:30:44,357
Kito, what is she saying?

466
00:30:44,435 --> 00:30:47,632
She says, she doesn't
use contraceptives.

467
00:30:47,705 --> 00:30:49,908
Send her away.
She's a Iesbian.

468
00:30:49,908 --> 00:30:53,105
- What? You speak?
- l am not a lesbian.

469
00:30:53,177 --> 00:30:54,872
Of course, I speak EngIish.

470
00:30:55,113 --> 00:30:56,512
But you whispered.

471
00:30:56,581 --> 00:31:00,852
It's an oId routine.
I've known her too Iong.

472
00:31:00,852 --> 00:31:03,821
She's aIways been a misery.

473
00:31:05,757 --> 00:31:07,156
Kiss me.

474
00:31:23,474 --> 00:31:25,840
I can't beIieve she's femaIe.

475
00:31:26,077 --> 00:31:27,135
She is a man.

476
00:31:27,211 --> 00:31:30,669
She couIdn't hide it.
At Ieast--

477
00:31:30,748 --> 00:31:32,682
how wouId she know where--

478
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,809
Training, observation,

479
00:31:34,886 --> 00:31:39,323
fuIfiIIing aII the femaIe
stereotypes invented by men.

480
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,857
You're too cynicaI.

481
00:31:42,894 --> 00:31:46,352
Can she-- he, be married?

482
00:31:46,431 --> 00:31:49,764
PossibIy.
Though you'd never see his wife.

483
00:31:49,834 --> 00:31:51,495
He wouIdn't much either--

484
00:31:51,569 --> 00:31:53,662
Work and rehearsal,

485
00:31:53,738 --> 00:31:55,569
dedication.

486
00:32:09,253 --> 00:32:11,221
Are you aII right?

487
00:32:16,828 --> 00:32:18,455
What did she say?

488
00:32:18,529 --> 00:32:22,590
- She says, impossibIe.
- What's impossibIe?

489
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:35,880
She says she wants to be
a female impersonator.

490
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,677
Whatever for?

491
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:49,091
She wants to be
more femaIe than she is.

492
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,219
Strange ambition.

493
00:32:51,295 --> 00:32:52,897
lsn't she female enough?

494
00:32:52,897 --> 00:32:54,831
He has to act. She is.

495
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:57,094
TeII her she's beautifuI.

496
00:32:58,536 --> 00:32:59,298
TeII her.

497
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,565
Is that aIways the way
you start a courtship?

498
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:03,732
It's the truth.

499
00:33:11,349 --> 00:33:14,375
Kito said you are
interested in her body.

500
00:33:14,452 --> 00:33:16,854
Watch out, Kito.
What are we paying you?

501
00:33:16,854 --> 00:33:20,085
Watch out, Storey,
I am jeaIous.

502
00:33:20,158 --> 00:33:21,859
You have no right
to be jealous of a woman

503
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:23,349
who wants to be
more of a woman

504
00:33:23,428 --> 00:33:25,157
by watching a man
dressed up as a woman.

505
00:33:25,229 --> 00:33:26,753
CompIicated, eh?

506
00:33:26,831 --> 00:33:29,823
What we need now
is an earthquake to cIear the air.

507
00:33:43,648 --> 00:33:46,617
- My God!
- How the hell did you do that?

508
00:33:46,684 --> 00:33:49,778
- Coincidence.
- Oh, you bring bad Iuck.

509
00:33:49,854 --> 00:33:52,482
Call up an earthquake
and he will follow you

510
00:33:52,557 --> 00:33:54,582
aII the days of your Iife.

511
00:33:57,261 --> 00:34:00,355
Teach me... aII about kabuki...

512
00:34:00,431 --> 00:34:03,366
and I-- we...

513
00:34:03,434 --> 00:34:05,994
wiII heIp you become
more Iike him.

514
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,537
Her.

515
00:34:07,605 --> 00:34:10,665
To be more female
than you think you are.

516
00:34:10,741 --> 00:34:12,675
Watch out, kabuki lover,

517
00:34:12,743 --> 00:34:15,337
you are in for some
sexuaI experiment.

518
00:34:15,413 --> 00:34:16,539
Shut up, Simato!

519
00:34:16,614 --> 00:34:18,605
What are we watching
but sexual experiment!

520
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,788
My feet ache.

521
00:34:24,856 --> 00:34:28,451
I'm not used
to so much waIking.

522
00:34:28,526 --> 00:34:31,017
Do I have to waIk anymore?

523
00:34:31,095 --> 00:34:33,865
What are you doing?

524
00:34:33,865 --> 00:34:37,096
Doing? l'm not doing anything.
l'm watering my coffee.

525
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:40,160
I can't make it taste
any worse than it does.

526
00:34:40,238 --> 00:34:42,035
You can't sit there
being miserabIe.

527
00:34:42,106 --> 00:34:43,573
l can't walk any more.

528
00:34:43,641 --> 00:34:45,506
I've seen too many shrines,
and they're no comfort

529
00:34:45,576 --> 00:34:47,441
- 'cause they're not my reIigion.
- Oh God, Father.

530
00:34:47,512 --> 00:34:49,207
Why don't you go and Iie down?

531
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,341
You're using the word God
an awfuI Iot these days.

532
00:34:53,417 --> 00:34:54,886
ls it significant for you?

533
00:34:54,886 --> 00:34:58,344
l hoped it was gonna be
significant for me, but alas no,

534
00:34:58,422 --> 00:35:01,721
for me it is onIy
etymoIogicaIIy interesting

535
00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:04,056
as dog backwards.

536
00:35:04,128 --> 00:35:06,831
Dad, stop being petuIant.

537
00:35:06,831 --> 00:35:09,095
Come, Mr. EmmenthaI,

538
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:10,998
watch TV with us.

539
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:12,558
TV?

540
00:35:12,637 --> 00:35:14,400
I don't watch it in Europe,

541
00:35:14,472 --> 00:35:16,565
why shouId I want
to watch it here?

542
00:35:45,469 --> 00:35:47,494
I didn't know you couId
do it Iike that.

543
00:35:47,572 --> 00:35:50,040
But outside of noveIs

544
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:51,802
and Swedish cinema--

545
00:35:51,876 --> 00:35:53,810
Dad, where have you been
aII these years?

546
00:35:53,878 --> 00:35:55,880
With your mother.

547
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,179
She was passionate
enough, but...

548
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,115
l can see now,
perhaps a little unadventurous.

549
00:36:01,185 --> 00:36:04,484
I bet it was your fauIt.
You were probabIy very Iazy.

550
00:36:04,555 --> 00:36:07,149
Come to think of it
perhaps with your mother

551
00:36:07,225 --> 00:36:09,352
I was too easiIy satisfied.

552
00:36:09,427 --> 00:36:11,224
I need some heIp.

553
00:36:11,295 --> 00:36:14,093
Do you think some re-training?

554
00:36:14,165 --> 00:36:15,427
Is that what you're doing?

555
00:36:15,499 --> 00:36:16,796
Is that the Japanese

556
00:36:17,034 --> 00:36:19,662
Do you have to be Japane--

557
00:36:19,737 --> 00:36:22,205
excuse me, Simato.

558
00:36:27,078 --> 00:36:30,514
How on earth couId you
beIieve that?

559
00:36:30,581 --> 00:36:33,209
l gave it a great
deal of thought.

560
00:36:33,284 --> 00:36:35,650
It sort of excited me,

561
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,688
but anatomicaIIy, I was worried.

562
00:36:37,755 --> 00:36:39,382
WeII I think we're
gonna have to put you

563
00:36:39,457 --> 00:36:41,823
out of your racist misery.

564
00:36:50,534 --> 00:36:53,094
Is she reaIIy Japanese?

565
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,873
And there are some
100 miIIion Japanese woman

566
00:36:55,873 --> 00:36:57,500
who are no Ionger Japanese.
because--

567
00:36:57,575 --> 00:37:00,811
I don't want your mother's
prejudices broadcast around.

568
00:37:00,811 --> 00:37:04,338
But l am delighted to find
that your mother was wro--

569
00:37:04,415 --> 00:37:06,679
Oh God, I'm gonna be sick.

570
00:37:11,822 --> 00:37:14,592
That's not very complimentary.

571
00:37:14,592 --> 00:37:17,561
I show you my girIfriend's private parts
and you rush off to be sick.

572
00:37:17,628 --> 00:37:20,831
I'm sorry, I was suddenIy fiIIed
with such intense

573
00:37:20,831 --> 00:37:23,766
and desperate Ionging
that aII my insides heaved.

574
00:37:23,834 --> 00:37:26,200
Do you know,
l am amazed, in a way,

575
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,170
to think that you can
get sick with grief.

576
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:30,571
Perhaps it was too much
in-fIight aIcohoI.

577
00:37:30,641 --> 00:37:32,472
That was four days ago.

578
00:37:32,543 --> 00:37:34,511
SIow stomach.

579
00:37:44,055 --> 00:37:46,649
Oh my God! What's happening!?

580
00:37:46,724 --> 00:37:48,385
It's an earthquake.

581
00:37:48,459 --> 00:37:51,257
The third-- third for me.
It's the best yet.

582
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:53,024
Asa nisi masa!

583
00:37:55,099 --> 00:37:57,033
Good God,
there's no one about.

584
00:37:57,101 --> 00:38:00,468
The street's empty.
Can't see much damage.

585
00:38:00,538 --> 00:38:03,200
"All day long, the noise of battle
rolled amongst the mountains

586
00:38:03,274 --> 00:38:05,037
down to the winter sea."

587
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:06,974
"Lucy in the sky with diamonds."

588
00:38:07,044 --> 00:38:10,815
"Nebuchadnezzar ate grass
"SmeIIs Iike teen spirit!"

589
00:38:10,815 --> 00:38:13,579
"Oh, yellow 'catchie'
come and have a go

590
00:38:13,651 --> 00:38:16,586
if you think you're
hard enough!"

591
00:38:17,822 --> 00:38:19,346
Get into bed.

592
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:21,789
We must ceIebrate
my third earthquake success.

593
00:38:23,127 --> 00:38:24,492
Success?

594
00:38:24,562 --> 00:38:26,621
I've survived
my third earthquake.

595
00:38:26,697 --> 00:38:29,393
What makes you think
they're yours excIusiveIy?

596
00:38:29,467 --> 00:38:31,799
You, Father,
have a Iot to Iearn.

597
00:38:32,837 --> 00:38:35,635
We must make the earth shake

598
00:38:35,706 --> 00:38:37,367
and quake for you.

599
00:38:41,379 --> 00:38:44,246
- Have you shaved?
- I don't need to shave.

600
00:38:44,315 --> 00:38:46,442
Her skin is very deIicate.

601
00:38:46,517 --> 00:38:50,146
My beard has hardIy grown
since your mother died.

602
00:38:50,221 --> 00:38:52,746
Okay, we'II show you
what to do.

603
00:38:52,823 --> 00:38:55,792
What do you mean?

604
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,863
CouId I have a Iight
Iess bright,

605
00:38:58,863 --> 00:39:00,694
do you think?

606
00:39:00,765 --> 00:39:03,427
- Let's Iose those sIippery sheets.
- No, Iet's not!

607
00:39:03,501 --> 00:39:06,804
Suppose there's another earthquake?
We'd be exposed.

608
00:39:06,804 --> 00:39:08,669
With the experiences
you're about to have,

609
00:39:08,739 --> 00:39:10,263
you're not supposed
to know the difference.

610
00:39:16,814 --> 00:39:20,181
- How can we do it again?
- Find your own woman.

611
00:39:21,385 --> 00:39:24,252
It was a speciaI
earthquake anniversary.

612
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:27,779
I got carried away.
Simato got carried away.

613
00:39:28,025 --> 00:39:31,256
Don't earthquakes make you feeI
very excited, indeed?

614
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:34,388
No-- emphaticaIIy not.

615
00:39:34,465 --> 00:39:36,558
The uItimate chance event.

616
00:39:36,634 --> 00:39:39,068
In this country,
you know they are coming.

617
00:39:39,136 --> 00:39:41,127
But nobody,
absoIuteIy nobody--

618
00:39:41,205 --> 00:39:43,765
no expert, no geoIogist,

619
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:48,039
no pubIic reIations men,
no poIitician-- knows when.

620
00:39:49,213 --> 00:39:52,205
No predictions,
no givabIe odds.

621
00:39:52,283 --> 00:39:53,511
Amazing.

622
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:59,250
And besides,
what about mother?

623
00:40:07,565 --> 00:40:09,867
Yes.

624
00:40:09,867 --> 00:40:12,768
WeII, that's a very brief
answer for you.

625
00:40:12,837 --> 00:40:15,533
Just what are you doing, Storey?

626
00:40:15,606 --> 00:40:17,699
You said you wanted to educate me.

627
00:40:17,775 --> 00:40:20,175
You keep giving me
the most delightful presents,

628
00:40:20,244 --> 00:40:21,879
and then you take them away.

629
00:40:21,879 --> 00:40:24,677
Think of aII those empty bedrooms
you've got in Geneva--

630
00:40:24,748 --> 00:40:28,240
and you once careIessIy
mentioned concubines.

631
00:40:29,887 --> 00:40:32,117
I suspect there are
quite a few Japanese Iadies

632
00:40:32,189 --> 00:40:35,249
who wouId Iike
to come to Europe.

633
00:40:35,326 --> 00:40:37,294
But what wouId your
mother think?

634
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:40,854
Don't teII her.

635
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,111
Look out for me.

636
00:40:58,182 --> 00:41:01,117
I want somebody warm--

637
00:41:01,185 --> 00:41:03,119
with a good body temperature.

638
00:41:03,187 --> 00:41:05,212
Did you know that
maIe temperatures are higher

639
00:41:05,289 --> 00:41:07,223
than femaIe temperatures?

640
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:08,859
No coId feet.

641
00:41:08,859 --> 00:41:10,861
LiteraIIy, or metaphoricaIIy.

642
00:41:10,861 --> 00:41:13,796
There's a woman in the Ocean
Fire Insurance Office Company

643
00:41:13,864 --> 00:41:16,526
I've aIways been intrigued about.

644
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,764
Wears a great deaI of pIaid,
though I'm certain she's not Scottish.

645
00:41:20,838 --> 00:41:23,170
I'm sure she's Norwegian.

646
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,875
Do you know any Norse?

647
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:27,241
Most Scandinavians
speak very good EngIish.

648
00:41:27,311 --> 00:41:30,610
Norse probabIy disappeared
over a thousand years ago.

649
00:41:30,681 --> 00:41:31,882
Look.

650
00:41:31,882 --> 00:41:33,645
We're under surveillance.

651
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:40,083
Do I Iook guiIty of anything?

652
00:41:40,157 --> 00:41:44,355
This Norwegian,
Scottish woman

653
00:41:44,428 --> 00:41:46,862
was under surveiIIance
for embezzIement.

654
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,365
Theresa's her name.
Or GriseIda.

655
00:41:53,437 --> 00:41:55,530
If it wasn't GriseIda
it ought to have been.

656
00:41:55,606 --> 00:41:58,097
She was good.
Fine fingers.

657
00:41:58,175 --> 00:42:01,611
One day she put
a poultice on my forehead

658
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:05,849
and my feet in a basin
of cold water with salt.

659
00:42:05,849 --> 00:42:07,817
I wasn't feeIing at aII weII.

660
00:42:08,052 --> 00:42:11,317
Then she made me a compIicated drink
that sent me to sIeep at my desk.

661
00:42:11,388 --> 00:42:13,322
Was this mereIy soIicitous,
do you think?

662
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,221
Or was she trying
to get to the safe?

663
00:42:15,292 --> 00:42:19,558
She was charged--
and I think, indicted.

664
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,393
I must see what I can do.

665
00:42:21,465 --> 00:42:24,229
You must help me there,
Mr. Expert.

666
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:29,799
Do you think l'll ever get
to see an in-flight Fellini movie?

667
00:42:44,421 --> 00:42:46,890
l would be curious
about one of those

668
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:48,892
Jane Austen women,
you know?

669
00:42:48,892 --> 00:42:51,895
Long suffering, dutifuI,
but aII right in the end.

670
00:42:51,895 --> 00:42:55,092
A pIump 19th Century type--
5'4",

671
00:42:55,165 --> 00:42:57,901
ringIets, brown eyes,
Iong fingers.

672
00:42:57,901 --> 00:43:00,369
Raw sex is the Iast thing
you're gonna encounter

673
00:43:00,437 --> 00:43:04,396
- in a Jane Austen woman.
- Rubbish. AbsoIute rubbish.

674
00:43:04,842 --> 00:43:08,334
A Iong white dress,
that starts under the breasts

675
00:43:08,412 --> 00:43:10,437
and traveIs on
interminabIy down

676
00:43:10,514 --> 00:43:12,850
so the Iegs are
entireIy mysterious.

677
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:14,852
She couId have one Ieg
or two inside that dress.

678
00:43:14,852 --> 00:43:16,717
A Jane Austen woman

679
00:43:16,787 --> 00:43:18,414
couId be incredibIy passionate
inside that dress.

680
00:43:18,489 --> 00:43:20,548
And you wouId never know
if she had feet.

681
00:43:20,624 --> 00:43:23,388
Which you couId not say
about Mio.

682
00:43:24,662 --> 00:43:26,391
Mio,

683
00:43:26,463 --> 00:43:28,556
this could be your room.

684
00:43:29,867 --> 00:43:33,030
You have a view
of the garden and the moat.

685
00:43:33,103 --> 00:43:35,196
You will feel very comfortable.

686
00:43:36,273 --> 00:43:39,834
The rising sun shines directIy
through the window.

687
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,261
Dickens.

688
00:44:05,335 --> 00:44:06,837
God, no.

689
00:44:06,837 --> 00:44:09,635
A Dickens heroine wouId never
Iet you see her sitting on the Ioo.

690
00:44:09,707 --> 00:44:13,609
I think a Jane Austen
heroine just might.

691
00:44:13,677 --> 00:44:15,702
She couId end up
Iike a Thomas Hardy woman.

692
00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:18,849
Victims-- start bad,
finish much worse.

693
00:44:18,849 --> 00:44:20,783
Lots of tears.

694
00:44:20,851 --> 00:44:22,341
CIothiIde?

695
00:44:22,419 --> 00:44:25,445
Can you go to room four
and ask Mio to get undressed,

696
00:44:25,522 --> 00:44:27,490
and take a bath?

697
00:44:27,558 --> 00:44:30,254
I don't speak the Ianguage,
Mr. EmmenthaI.

698
00:44:30,327 --> 00:44:31,726
Neither do we.

699
00:44:31,795 --> 00:44:34,865
- I must get Kito to come over.
- No, we mustn't.

700
00:44:34,865 --> 00:44:37,026
She'II have us aII audited.

701
00:44:37,101 --> 00:44:39,501
Thomas Hardy was interested
in seIIing women.

702
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:42,061
That's auditing for you.
The uItimate audit.

703
00:44:42,139 --> 00:44:43,834
Sell your wife.

704
00:44:46,877 --> 00:44:48,879
l found out her name.

705
00:44:48,879 --> 00:44:51,347
Georgette.

706
00:44:51,415 --> 00:44:54,350
Such a modern name.
lt sounds Romanian.

707
00:44:54,418 --> 00:44:56,682
Sounds like someone
who's had a sex change.

708
00:44:56,754 --> 00:45:00,053
- She's a retired nun.
- Retired?

709
00:45:00,124 --> 00:45:02,649
How on earth
can she be retired?

710
00:45:02,726 --> 00:45:06,287
She's bound to enjoy scrubbing.
Look at her hands.

711
00:45:06,363 --> 00:45:10,094
She's must be allowed
to scrub a great deal.

712
00:45:12,035 --> 00:45:14,663
She's like all those
nun paintings.

713
00:45:14,738 --> 00:45:18,765
The starched Iinen,
pIucked brows,

714
00:45:18,842 --> 00:45:22,141
sharp pins in the pink flesh,

715
00:45:22,212 --> 00:45:25,409
and the wet eyes,
the devotional glance.

716
00:45:25,482 --> 00:45:27,450
And modesty that
conceals the body

717
00:45:27,518 --> 00:45:30,112
that still has breasts
and pubic hair.

718
00:45:30,187 --> 00:45:33,350
The contrast is so exciting.

719
00:45:33,423 --> 00:45:35,186
She's certainly a bed maker.

720
00:45:35,259 --> 00:45:39,093
Clean sheets flying
in the air in the sunlight.

721
00:45:39,163 --> 00:45:42,030
She'd be an angel,
making her bed forever.

722
00:45:44,268 --> 00:45:47,260
She owes the bank
140,000 pounds.

723
00:45:47,337 --> 00:45:49,032
How do you know?

724
00:45:49,106 --> 00:45:52,633
Come on. How does
a bank manager know secrets?

725
00:45:52,709 --> 00:45:54,267
Let's tempt her.

726
00:45:55,612 --> 00:45:58,479
Offer her a loan--
high interest.

727
00:45:58,549 --> 00:46:00,676
See how she reacts,

728
00:46:00,751 --> 00:46:02,685
and then more.

729
00:46:02,753 --> 00:46:05,085
Make sure she doubIes the debt

730
00:46:05,155 --> 00:46:07,089
and then offer her a way out.

731
00:46:09,593 --> 00:46:12,494
Whiter, much whiter.

732
00:46:12,563 --> 00:46:14,832
Like miIk.

733
00:46:14,832 --> 00:46:17,027
Or snow.

734
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,838
And make her Iips
very, very smaII.

735
00:46:20,838 --> 00:46:23,807
So small, l couldn't get
my little finger between them.

736
00:46:25,843 --> 00:46:28,277
Are we doing this correctIy,
do you think?

737
00:46:28,345 --> 00:46:30,848
ShouId we paint her
entire body white, do you think?

738
00:46:30,848 --> 00:46:33,442
Let's do it anyway.

739
00:46:33,517 --> 00:46:35,382
No, CIothiIde.

740
00:46:35,452 --> 00:46:37,420
Not here.
It's most out of pIace.

741
00:46:37,487 --> 00:46:40,547
I teII you what,
take it to bedroom one--

742
00:46:40,624 --> 00:46:42,558
no, six.

743
00:46:42,626 --> 00:46:45,186
In preparation.
A token.

744
00:46:45,262 --> 00:46:47,594
We must find
somewhere to fit it.

745
00:46:47,664 --> 00:46:49,461
Stand it at the end of the bed

746
00:46:49,533 --> 00:46:51,433
And surround it in flowers.

747
00:46:51,501 --> 00:46:54,334
Poppies-- Renoir fIowers.

748
00:46:54,404 --> 00:46:58,135
- Are poppies in season?
- No, Mr. EmmenthaI.

749
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:02,340
What are Renoir's fiIms Iike?

750
00:47:02,412 --> 00:47:05,816
He was the director who said,
"Every man has his reasons."

751
00:47:05,816 --> 00:47:07,408
Do we have reasons?

752
00:47:07,484 --> 00:47:11,420
No-- you just have Iust.

753
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:51,486
Oh, beautifuI.

754
00:47:51,561 --> 00:47:53,791
It smeIIs of canaries.

755
00:47:58,835 --> 00:48:00,302
Lapsang souchong.

756
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:04,808
The smeII of my watch strap
after a game of squash.

757
00:48:04,808 --> 00:48:08,141
- Mice.
- Horsehair cushions.

758
00:48:08,211 --> 00:48:12,079
Brown sugar just unwrapped
out of a damp paper bag.

759
00:48:12,149 --> 00:48:13,776
Burnt eggs.

760
00:48:35,605 --> 00:48:38,233
No orgies,
Don't want to get sexual indigestion.

761
00:48:38,308 --> 00:48:41,471
l can't stand more than one
naked woman at a time.

762
00:48:41,545 --> 00:48:43,638
lt reminds me of a pig farm
or a cattle market,

763
00:48:43,714 --> 00:48:47,241
or one of those terrible
concentration camp films.

764
00:48:47,317 --> 00:48:48,852
Good Lord, Iook at that.

765
00:48:48,852 --> 00:48:51,855
WouId you beIieve it--
in the 1990s?

766
00:49:08,372 --> 00:49:09,771
What's her name?

767
00:49:11,575 --> 00:49:14,169
- Caspar.
- Caspar?

768
00:49:14,244 --> 00:49:16,610
Oh, no, sorry.
That's the name of the horse.

769
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:21,049
Is he... aII right?

770
00:49:21,118 --> 00:49:23,552
What is the name
of your horse doing

771
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:26,589
on your hospitaI charge sheet?

772
00:49:26,656 --> 00:49:30,057
He's not my horse.

773
00:49:30,127 --> 00:49:34,223
- He's not your horse?
- Then whose horse is it?

774
00:49:35,298 --> 00:49:37,459
I stoIe him.

775
00:49:37,534 --> 00:49:39,297
You stole him?

776
00:49:40,837 --> 00:49:42,839
Hey...

777
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:45,774
why don't you come
and convaIesce with us?

778
00:49:45,842 --> 00:49:47,844
We couId provide you
with a new horse.

779
00:49:47,844 --> 00:49:49,436
A physiotherapist.

780
00:49:49,513 --> 00:49:51,504
You could do therapy
in our pool.

781
00:49:51,581 --> 00:49:53,412
The horse couId do
therapy in our pooI.

782
00:49:55,419 --> 00:49:57,114
Where are you going?

783
00:49:57,187 --> 00:49:59,747
- To buy some fIowers.
- FIowers aren't gonna heIp.

784
00:49:59,823 --> 00:50:01,120
Yes, they are.

785
00:50:01,191 --> 00:50:03,751
CIothiIde says
fIowers aIways heIp.

786
00:50:14,871 --> 00:50:17,874
Good evening.

787
00:50:17,874 --> 00:50:19,876
BeautifuI.

788
00:50:19,876 --> 00:50:21,878
Excuse me?

789
00:50:21,878 --> 00:50:24,278
You are Iooking so beautifuI.

790
00:50:24,347 --> 00:50:25,882
Thank you.

791
00:50:25,882 --> 00:50:28,282
Pregnancy makes you beautifuI.

792
00:50:28,351 --> 00:50:30,785
Don't you think?

793
00:50:30,854 --> 00:50:32,515
You know?

794
00:50:32,589 --> 00:50:35,854
Wake up-- having babies?

795
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:39,660
This is the sixth.

796
00:50:39,729 --> 00:50:41,321
The sixth?

797
00:50:41,398 --> 00:50:43,662
You must have
an understanding husband.

798
00:50:43,733 --> 00:50:46,361
Tsk, tsk... no husband.

799
00:50:46,436 --> 00:50:47,630
Oh!

800
00:50:47,704 --> 00:50:49,906
ArtificiaI insemination?

801
00:50:49,906 --> 00:50:53,808
No, too impersonaI.

802
00:50:53,877 --> 00:50:55,276
Are you offering?

803
00:50:55,345 --> 00:50:57,245
No.

804
00:50:57,314 --> 00:51:00,613
I mean-- weII, I couId.
I-- I'd Iike to.

805
00:51:00,684 --> 00:51:03,175
Can I?
And the chiIdren?

806
00:51:03,253 --> 00:51:06,188
Three adopted.
Two with their fathers.

807
00:51:06,256 --> 00:51:08,156
You could think about it.

808
00:51:11,094 --> 00:51:13,392
Nice hair.

809
00:51:16,633 --> 00:51:18,794
Do you stiII go to church?

810
00:51:18,869 --> 00:51:20,871
No.

811
00:51:20,871 --> 00:51:23,101
Do you stiII say
your prayers?

812
00:51:23,173 --> 00:51:24,105
No.

813
00:51:25,475 --> 00:51:27,067
Do you stiII beIieve in heII?

814
00:51:27,144 --> 00:51:30,045
Depends what you mean by still.

815
00:51:30,113 --> 00:51:31,774
l've never believed in hell.

816
00:51:31,848 --> 00:51:33,884
Then you beIieve
you wiII not pay for your sins?

817
00:51:33,884 --> 00:51:36,352
Not in hell, only on Earth.

818
00:51:36,419 --> 00:51:39,820
However, I've aIways
beIieved in heaven.

819
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:41,721
Heaven on Earth.

820
00:51:41,791 --> 00:51:43,894
And you, GriseIda,
are a piece of heaven.

821
00:51:43,894 --> 00:51:46,055
- But--
- But what?

822
00:51:46,129 --> 00:51:48,620
Now, don't take this
reIigion too seriousIy.

823
00:51:48,698 --> 00:51:51,724
- lt's a pose.
- No, it is not.

824
00:51:51,801 --> 00:51:53,701
It is a way of Iife.

825
00:51:54,905 --> 00:51:57,601
Come in.

826
00:51:57,674 --> 00:51:59,910
GriseIda's becoming
a nun in her heart

827
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:01,571
as weII as her body.

828
00:52:01,645 --> 00:52:03,847
Then I'm aIready
jeaIous of God.

829
00:52:03,847 --> 00:52:05,712
JeaIousy?

830
00:52:05,782 --> 00:52:07,340
It'II destroy you.

831
00:52:07,417 --> 00:52:10,682
- "OtheIIo."
- CompIimentary tickets.

832
00:52:10,754 --> 00:52:13,723
I'm the financiaI secretary
of the friends of the Genevan opera.

833
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,859
ObIigations to attend.

834
00:52:15,859 --> 00:52:18,327
You bored us aII
in Kyoto, Storey,

835
00:52:18,395 --> 00:52:19,863
by taking us to the kabuki.

836
00:52:19,863 --> 00:52:22,491
It's my turn to bore you.
We go to the opera.

837
00:52:22,566 --> 00:52:24,591
The whoIe firm wiII go.

838
00:52:24,668 --> 00:52:26,499
Dress up.
The fuII compIement.

839
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:27,832
Now, pIease Ieave us.

840
00:52:28,071 --> 00:52:31,063
Devout, inestimabIe GriseIda

841
00:52:31,141 --> 00:52:33,166
has a higher caIIing to make.

842
00:52:33,243 --> 00:52:35,879
- I'm taking CIothiIde.
- Oh, whatever for?

843
00:52:35,879 --> 00:52:37,847
It's obvious she wouId
want to come.

844
00:52:39,416 --> 00:52:42,180
I understand the
thoroughbred was worth nearIy

845
00:52:42,252 --> 00:52:45,619
haIf a miIIion doIIars.
Owned by a Saudi Arabian.

846
00:52:45,689 --> 00:52:48,419
Now, there are some peopIe
who prize their horses

847
00:52:48,491 --> 00:52:50,618
above their women.

848
00:52:50,694 --> 00:52:53,897
Punishments in Saudi Arabia
can be harsh.

849
00:52:53,897 --> 00:52:57,901
- An eye for an eye.
- A horse for a horse.

850
00:52:57,901 --> 00:52:59,801
A horse for a woman?

851
00:52:59,869 --> 00:53:01,461
No, l don't think,
we need go quite that far.

852
00:53:01,538 --> 00:53:04,769
And as it happens,
we were abIe to return it.

853
00:53:04,841 --> 00:53:09,175
- Caspar.
- Caspar.

854
00:53:09,246 --> 00:53:11,180
There were questions asked.

855
00:53:11,248 --> 00:53:15,207
And the owners have
a pretty shrewd idea

856
00:53:15,285 --> 00:53:17,583
who stole their horse.

857
00:53:17,654 --> 00:53:19,349
lt seems you've done it before.

858
00:53:19,422 --> 00:53:23,017
They did not understand
what a sensitive horse they had.

859
00:53:23,093 --> 00:53:25,186
They had no idea.

860
00:53:25,262 --> 00:53:27,730
He needed affection.

861
00:53:27,797 --> 00:53:29,287
Perhaps.

862
00:53:29,366 --> 00:53:32,426
- Are they downstairs?
- Good Lord, no. I don't think so.

863
00:53:32,502 --> 00:53:36,165
- At Ieast not yet.
- Not yet?

864
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:38,264
Who are those peopIe?

865
00:53:40,277 --> 00:53:42,879
I am accused
of unethicaI practices.

866
00:53:42,879 --> 00:53:44,676
And what may they be?

867
00:53:44,748 --> 00:53:48,684
WeII, I Iike having babies.

868
00:53:48,752 --> 00:53:50,219
So I've noticed.

869
00:53:51,588 --> 00:53:53,453
There are many peopIe
in the worId

870
00:53:53,523 --> 00:53:55,892
who want to have babies
and can't have them.

871
00:53:55,892 --> 00:53:59,589
So, you perform an unusuaI
phiIanthropic service?

872
00:53:59,663 --> 00:54:01,722
I'm good at having babies.

873
00:54:01,798 --> 00:54:04,834
Is it so bad to make a Iiving
at what you're good at?

874
00:54:04,834 --> 00:54:06,734
I see.

875
00:54:06,803 --> 00:54:10,705
This time there is a way out.

876
00:54:10,774 --> 00:54:12,435
I can see it coming.

877
00:54:12,509 --> 00:54:15,845
You can be my husband.

878
00:54:15,845 --> 00:54:18,143
Am I to be responsibIe
for aII six?

879
00:54:18,214 --> 00:54:22,344
No. You can be the father
of just this one.

880
00:54:23,486 --> 00:54:26,455
I have a proposition.

881
00:54:26,523 --> 00:54:28,548
Quite frankIy, Mr. EmmenthaI,

882
00:54:28,625 --> 00:54:31,219
I am a modern woman.

883
00:54:31,294 --> 00:54:35,865
I do not want to be
deported to Saudi Arabia.

884
00:54:35,865 --> 00:54:39,767
And as Iong as horses
are invoIved,

885
00:54:39,836 --> 00:54:43,237
I think I am prepared
for aII eventuaIities.

886
00:54:43,306 --> 00:54:46,876
However, I have one
important responsibiIity

887
00:54:46,876 --> 00:54:49,845
I cannot reIinquish.

888
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:53,777
- I have a pig.
- A pig?

889
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:55,885
Horses and pigs

890
00:54:55,885 --> 00:54:57,853
aIways get on weII together.

891
00:54:58,088 --> 00:55:00,215
They are inteIIigent animaIs

892
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:03,521
and Iike one another's company.

893
00:55:03,593 --> 00:55:05,561
Can you--

894
00:55:05,628 --> 00:55:08,461
can you ride a pig?

895
00:55:08,531 --> 00:55:12,729
Hortense is far too dignified
to be ridden.

896
00:55:12,802 --> 00:55:17,432
However, Hortense and I
have a reIationship--

897
00:55:17,507 --> 00:55:19,634
which you might find unusuaI--

898
00:55:19,709 --> 00:55:22,473
beyond mere affection.

899
00:55:22,545 --> 00:55:27,039
I have no intention
of breaking this reIationship.

900
00:55:27,117 --> 00:55:30,109
- I see.
- Neither does Hortense.

901
00:55:30,186 --> 00:55:32,279
WeII...

902
00:55:32,355 --> 00:55:35,586
as Iong as I don't
get too jeaIous,

903
00:55:35,658 --> 00:55:38,058
and you both
take a bath afterwards,

904
00:55:38,128 --> 00:55:41,325
l can't see that l need
to be difficult.

905
00:55:42,832 --> 00:55:45,198
Kiss me.

906
00:55:50,874 --> 00:55:53,877
That was a husband's kiss,
I suppose.

907
00:55:53,877 --> 00:55:56,675
You couId show
a IittIe more passion.

908
00:56:16,266 --> 00:56:17,834
WeII--

909
00:56:17,834 --> 00:56:20,667
weII, I suppose you better
make you an offer.

910
00:56:20,737 --> 00:56:24,104
We-- I, wiII pay for you

911
00:56:24,174 --> 00:56:26,335
to have babies.

912
00:56:28,645 --> 00:56:32,240
No artificiaI insemination.

913
00:56:32,315 --> 00:56:34,851
And you have come
to coIIect this chiId.

914
00:56:34,851 --> 00:56:36,853
When it's ready, of course.

915
00:56:36,853 --> 00:56:39,754
I'm having no interferences.

916
00:56:39,823 --> 00:56:41,654
Of course not.

917
00:56:41,724 --> 00:56:42,859
In that case,

918
00:56:42,859 --> 00:56:45,089
couId you have me moved
into a nicer room?

919
00:56:45,161 --> 00:56:47,220
I think...

920
00:56:47,297 --> 00:56:50,266
bIue waIIs.

921
00:56:50,333 --> 00:56:53,325
I'm sure it's going to be
a boy this time.

922
00:56:54,804 --> 00:56:59,639
And I think I charge
$25,000 for a boy.

923
00:58:02,038 --> 00:58:04,768
It's time now.

924
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,534
Are you enjoying
the music, Clothilde?

925
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:44,341
I am enjoying
Mr. EmmenthaI's smiIe.

926
00:58:44,414 --> 00:58:48,783
He was so heartbroken
at the death of his wife.

927
00:58:48,851 --> 00:58:51,513
WeII, you couId aIways
enjoy his smiIe at home.

928
00:58:51,588 --> 00:58:54,284
She was good to me.

929
00:58:54,357 --> 00:58:57,193
I wouId Iike to repay
her kindness

930
00:58:57,193 --> 00:58:58,820
trying to make
her widower

931
00:58:59,062 --> 00:59:02,799
and his son happy.

932
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:05,563
I couId never take
EmiIia's pIace entireIy,

933
00:59:05,635 --> 00:59:09,696
but I wouId be honored
to take it in part.

934
00:59:09,772 --> 00:59:12,002
Which part?

935
00:59:12,075 --> 00:59:15,340
Whichever part he wishes.

936
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:20,583
I wouId Iike to ask

937
00:59:20,583 --> 00:59:22,778
if I couId be aIIowed to--

938
00:59:24,253 --> 00:59:27,051
no, l can't say this--

939
00:59:27,123 --> 00:59:29,683
Go on, say it.

940
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:34,059
to wear her hats.

941
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:36,564
My mother's hats?

942
00:59:36,633 --> 00:59:39,329
That's aII?
Just her hats?

943
00:59:39,402 --> 00:59:41,734
In bed.

944
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:47,400
Nothing eIse.

945
00:59:48,845 --> 00:59:51,439
I know you, don't I?

946
00:59:51,514 --> 00:59:54,210
At Ieast I know
your father, PhiIip.

947
00:59:55,718 --> 00:59:58,243
These aII your girIfriends?

948
00:59:58,321 --> 01:00:01,085
OrientaI speciaIities?

949
01:00:01,157 --> 01:00:03,785
Best of luck.

950
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:06,328
You're very restIess.

951
01:00:06,396 --> 01:00:10,560
You weren't taking them
to the gents for a fuck, were you?

952
01:00:10,633 --> 01:00:13,169
That one's crying
her eyes out.

953
01:00:13,169 --> 01:00:15,535
What have you done to her?

954
01:00:15,605 --> 01:00:17,596
It's her birthday.

955
01:00:17,674 --> 01:00:21,303
WeII, that expIains everything.

956
01:00:21,377 --> 01:00:23,641
She's sentimentaI.

957
01:00:23,713 --> 01:00:25,647
Likes horses.

958
01:00:25,715 --> 01:00:28,275
And especiaIIy pigs,

959
01:00:28,351 --> 01:00:29,579
apparentIy.

960
01:00:32,889 --> 01:00:36,655
Go and get us something to drink.
I have a desperate thirst.

961
01:00:44,667 --> 01:00:48,228
I reaIIy did know your father
three years ago.

962
01:00:48,304 --> 01:00:50,704
I heId his hand
at a passing-out ceremony

963
01:00:50,773 --> 01:00:52,707
on a very big stage.

964
01:00:52,775 --> 01:00:56,913
I toId him where to stand.
He was very awkward.

965
01:00:56,913 --> 01:00:59,711
I aIways Iiked the way
he swung his Iegs.

966
01:00:59,782 --> 01:01:02,852
Always thought
he'd do himself an injury.

967
01:01:02,852 --> 01:01:06,515
I asked him
to sIeep with me.

968
01:01:06,589 --> 01:01:09,057
I Iaid it aII on for him.

969
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:12,595
I brought my toothbrush
and a cIean pair of knickers

970
01:01:12,595 --> 01:01:14,864
round to his
hoteI room in Utrecht.

971
01:01:14,864 --> 01:01:16,866
Or was it Berlin?

972
01:01:16,866 --> 01:01:20,597
However, he turned me down.

973
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:23,106
AII manner of
ridicuIous excuses,

974
01:01:23,106 --> 01:01:24,874
Iike, he was
happiIy married.

975
01:01:24,874 --> 01:01:27,308
Wasted a golden opportunity.

976
01:01:28,344 --> 01:01:30,107
However, never say die.

977
01:01:30,179 --> 01:01:33,205
I've Iooked forward
to French kissing him ever since.

978
01:01:39,789 --> 01:01:44,385
( Des--demona )

979
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:48,487
Meet Simon--
the singing cockereI.

980
01:01:49,665 --> 01:01:51,656
Simon has no shame.

981
01:01:51,734 --> 01:01:54,703
He says I wiII aIways be
the favorite white woman

982
01:01:54,771 --> 01:01:56,705
he Ioves to undress.

983
01:01:56,773 --> 01:01:58,741
And he does it
as often as he can,

984
01:01:58,808 --> 01:02:00,776
which is often,
and everywhere.

985
01:02:00,843 --> 01:02:03,471
And in the most
unIikeIy pIaces.

986
01:02:03,546 --> 01:02:05,571
OnIy he goes
on tour,

987
01:02:05,648 --> 01:02:07,411
and he has a wife.
Don't you, Simon?

988
01:02:07,483 --> 01:02:10,748
And he makes me wait
for the services of his big bIack cock,

989
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:14,381
and the deIights of his
magnificent singing voice.

990
01:02:14,457 --> 01:02:17,017
Or is it the other
way around?

991
01:02:30,473 --> 01:02:33,169
So...

992
01:02:33,242 --> 01:02:35,142
how is your father?

993
01:02:35,211 --> 01:02:37,475
Why don't you come and see?

994
01:02:37,547 --> 01:02:39,378
- But he's not bIack.
- That's true.

995
01:02:39,448 --> 01:02:42,508
- And he can't sing.
- Not that I remember.

996
01:02:42,585 --> 01:02:44,887
We couId aIways cork his face
and pinch his backside,

997
01:02:44,887 --> 01:02:47,651
and he might give you a dark stare
and a IittIe scream.

998
01:02:47,723 --> 01:02:49,892
He used to stroke
his IittIe round beIIy

999
01:02:49,892 --> 01:02:52,087
with a circuIar motion.

1000
01:02:53,262 --> 01:02:56,899
I'd Iike to do the same.
TeII him.

1001
01:02:56,899 --> 01:02:59,868
What wouId you say
if I'd Iike to share the attentions?

1002
01:03:01,838 --> 01:03:04,238
Perhaps.

1003
01:03:04,307 --> 01:03:06,241
Are you his naturaI heir?

1004
01:03:06,309 --> 01:03:09,506
I am his heir.
NaturaIIy and unnaturaIIy.

1005
01:03:09,579 --> 01:03:12,571
- FinanciaIIy?
- FinanciaIIy.

1006
01:03:12,648 --> 01:03:15,583
What have you got
that I've never seen before?

1007
01:04:00,096 --> 01:04:03,031
You're free to go, PaImira.

1008
01:04:03,099 --> 01:04:06,000
You are free to go.

1009
01:04:18,514 --> 01:04:21,851
l'll be your number four private whore--

1010
01:04:21,851 --> 01:04:23,853
for one year,

1011
01:04:23,853 --> 01:04:27,186
for 75,000 US dollars.

1012
01:04:27,256 --> 01:04:30,123
No possible demands
denied.

1013
01:04:30,192 --> 01:04:33,161
lmpossible ones
considered.

1014
01:04:33,229 --> 01:04:35,823
l have a high pain
tolerance,

1015
01:04:36,866 --> 01:04:39,391
but don't abuse it.

1016
01:04:39,468 --> 01:04:41,527
The greater your invention,

1017
01:04:43,406 --> 01:04:45,601
the greater mine.

1018
01:04:48,844 --> 01:04:51,836
I'II Iook after
the contraception.

1019
01:04:52,081 --> 01:04:54,884
Never trust an oId man.

1020
01:04:54,884 --> 01:04:57,079
UnreasonabIe?

1021
01:04:59,555 --> 01:05:02,285
If I'm sharing your prick,

1022
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:06,162
I want medicaI checks
every week

1023
01:05:06,162 --> 01:05:08,289
with a quaIified doctor.

1024
01:05:21,677 --> 01:05:24,847
And I want my privacy,

1025
01:05:24,847 --> 01:05:27,850
when I need it.

1026
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:31,479
And I want to sIeep Iate.
Very Iate.

1027
01:05:32,855 --> 01:05:35,346
And I want to traveI.

1028
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:39,828
So, PhiIip,

1029
01:05:41,097 --> 01:05:44,089
I want to see what
I missed three years ago.

1030
01:05:45,735 --> 01:05:48,499
You can have me on approvaI.

1031
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:55,542
Open the window,
I need fresh air.

1032
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:10,684
Out you go,
Storey EmmenthaI.

1033
01:06:12,595 --> 01:06:15,530
Let's see what tune
your father sings,

1034
01:06:15,598 --> 01:06:18,328
and how he's gonna
sing it with me.

1035
01:06:58,441 --> 01:07:00,534
lt's okay, it's on expenses.

1036
01:07:00,609 --> 01:07:03,203
Whose goddamn expenses?

1037
01:07:03,279 --> 01:07:05,042
Tax deductibIe.

1038
01:07:05,114 --> 01:07:07,981
From Kensai,
or from Geneva airport?

1039
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:09,142
From Paris.

1040
01:07:09,218 --> 01:07:12,278
But that's hours away
by heIicopter.

1041
01:07:12,354 --> 01:07:14,151
- I bought, ah--
- Put her in room six.

1042
01:07:14,223 --> 01:07:16,384
We'II fix somewhere
for her Iater.

1043
01:07:38,547 --> 01:07:41,539
Giaconda?

1044
01:07:42,818 --> 01:07:45,514
Giaconda?

1045
01:07:47,857 --> 01:07:49,859
My God! What have
you done with the baby?

1046
01:07:49,859 --> 01:07:50,793
What baby?

1047
01:07:50,793 --> 01:07:52,522
God, who are you?

1048
01:07:52,595 --> 01:07:55,359
Oh God, Kito.

1049
01:07:55,431 --> 01:07:58,594
- But you're in Kyoto.
- Oh, stop that.

1050
01:07:58,667 --> 01:08:02,296
- Stop what?
- l'm too tired for that.

1051
01:08:02,371 --> 01:08:04,464
And you're drunk.

1052
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:06,440
You're not supposed to be in here.

1053
01:08:06,509 --> 01:08:08,636
This is Giaconda's room.

1054
01:08:08,711 --> 01:08:11,475
l'm only staying a few nights.

1055
01:08:12,548 --> 01:08:14,675
l arrived from the sky.

1056
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:18,821
l'll stay a few moments,
just to warm you up.

1057
01:08:18,821 --> 01:08:22,313
l'll wait a little bit just in case
Giaconda comes back.

1058
01:08:22,391 --> 01:08:24,188
She's probably gone
for a pee.

1059
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:26,626
Pregnant women spend
half the night going to the loo.

1060
01:08:26,695 --> 01:08:28,026
Did you know that?

1061
01:08:28,097 --> 01:08:31,498
Yes, l did know that.

1062
01:08:31,567 --> 01:08:35,799
And with a little help
from you...

1063
01:08:36,038 --> 01:08:38,472
l might be able
to experience it, too.

1064
01:08:40,142 --> 01:08:41,666
Kito.

1065
01:08:41,744 --> 01:08:44,269
Oh, Kito.

1066
01:08:44,346 --> 01:08:46,507
You have always
surprised me.

1067
01:08:49,485 --> 01:08:50,853
Poor thing.

1068
01:08:50,853 --> 01:08:53,219
They say she's onIy
haIf a person.

1069
01:08:53,289 --> 01:08:54,857
A midget.

1070
01:08:54,857 --> 01:08:57,325
I've heard worse.

1071
01:08:57,393 --> 01:08:59,418
Much worse.

1072
01:08:59,495 --> 01:09:01,326
That she's a mongreI.

1073
01:09:01,397 --> 01:09:04,025
A mongreI?
What do you mean?

1074
01:09:04,099 --> 01:09:05,801
How come?

1075
01:09:05,801 --> 01:09:09,635
If there ever was
a good case for abortion...

1076
01:09:13,642 --> 01:09:17,009
- I don't understand.
- Have you been in that room?

1077
01:09:17,079 --> 01:09:18,774
No.

1078
01:09:20,115 --> 01:09:22,818
There's no number
on the door.

1079
01:09:22,818 --> 01:09:26,151
They haven't even
given her a proper name.

1080
01:09:26,222 --> 01:09:29,157
They sometimes
call her Giuletta,

1081
01:09:29,225 --> 01:09:32,626
after a fiIm
about a waif and stray,

1082
01:09:32,695 --> 01:09:35,562
a simpIeton
who pIays a trumpet.

1083
01:09:35,631 --> 01:09:38,759
You don't think for a moment
that it's a chiId?

1084
01:09:38,834 --> 01:09:40,597
God, no.

1085
01:09:40,669 --> 01:09:42,694
She sounds Korean.

1086
01:09:42,771 --> 01:09:45,672
How wouId you know that?

1087
01:09:45,741 --> 01:09:48,676
Kito says she was born
in a Pachinko parIor,

1088
01:09:48,744 --> 01:09:51,679
and deaf because
of aII the noise.

1089
01:09:51,747 --> 01:09:54,773
Kito Ioves Storey
to distraction.

1090
01:09:54,850 --> 01:09:59,014
I wouId never beIieve
anything she says.

1091
01:09:59,088 --> 01:10:02,216
Perhaps she's Vietnamese?

1092
01:10:02,291 --> 01:10:04,657
A boat person?

1093
01:10:04,727 --> 01:10:09,096
What? Who arrived one morning
on the Iake from Hong Kong?

1094
01:10:11,133 --> 01:10:13,795
I don't think it's a woman at aII.

1095
01:10:13,869 --> 01:10:17,703
I'II bet it's a man.
A transsexuaI.

1096
01:10:17,773 --> 01:10:21,038
And the haIf refers
to a haIf-man, haIf-woman.

1097
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:24,341
Francois says they
conceived it together--

1098
01:10:24,413 --> 01:10:27,348
- The father and son.
- CeIeste!

1099
01:10:27,416 --> 01:10:29,885
For God's sake,
puII the other one.

1100
01:10:29,885 --> 01:10:31,580
Through the backside.

1101
01:10:31,654 --> 01:10:33,519
RidicuIous.

1102
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:37,120
Who was the father, then?

1103
01:10:37,192 --> 01:10:40,218
WeII he was, of course--
the oIder.

1104
01:10:40,296 --> 01:10:43,754
There's more spunk in him
than a cage of chimpanzees.

1105
01:10:43,832 --> 01:10:47,598
How do you know that?

1106
01:10:49,171 --> 01:10:51,537
I know.

1107
01:10:51,607 --> 01:10:54,235
I wanted to be a candidate once,
you know?

1108
01:10:55,744 --> 01:10:57,735
Clothilde made it.

1109
01:10:57,813 --> 01:11:00,849
But I aIways suspect
she had an uIterior motive,

1110
01:11:00,849 --> 01:11:04,615
being EmiIia's favorite
when she was aIive.

1111
01:11:04,687 --> 01:11:06,780
I went for an audition.

1112
01:11:06,855 --> 01:11:09,653
They tried me out,

1113
01:11:09,725 --> 01:11:12,694
but they weren't too excited.

1114
01:11:12,761 --> 01:11:14,863
I was too wiIIing.

1115
01:11:14,863 --> 01:11:18,299
l liked the prison life
too much.

1116
01:11:18,367 --> 01:11:22,167
And I loved the cIothes.

1117
01:11:22,237 --> 01:11:25,604
I even Iiked the humiIiations,
you know?

1118
01:11:26,875 --> 01:11:29,275
No...

1119
01:11:29,345 --> 01:11:31,506
I don't know.

1120
01:11:32,648 --> 01:11:34,883
Hot drinking chocoIate,

1121
01:11:34,883 --> 01:11:38,284
foIIowed by the ice cubes.

1122
01:11:38,354 --> 01:11:40,788
You know the stuff.

1123
01:11:40,856 --> 01:11:43,620
Picking up handkerchiefs
off the floor

1124
01:11:43,692 --> 01:11:45,751
with your teeth when you're naked.

1125
01:11:45,828 --> 01:11:47,896
Gallons of hot water,

1126
01:11:47,896 --> 01:11:52,094
string vests,
and wet t-shirts,

1127
01:11:52,167 --> 01:11:54,328
and nippIe cIips.

1128
01:11:54,403 --> 01:11:56,132
Shaved beIIy.

1129
01:11:56,205 --> 01:11:59,265
AII the cIiches.

1130
01:11:59,341 --> 01:12:03,141
You've seen them in the cinema,
and read about them in the newspapers.

1131
01:12:03,212 --> 01:12:05,647
Standing on your head--

1132
01:12:05,647 --> 01:12:07,808
miIk bathing--

1133
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:11,213
putting on excess weight.

1134
01:12:12,454 --> 01:12:17,289
Sounds Iike athIetic
nouveIIe cuisine.

1135
01:12:17,359 --> 01:12:20,351
WeII, it couId be--
in a way.

1136
01:12:25,734 --> 01:12:28,100
Goodnight, sleep tight,

1137
01:12:28,170 --> 01:12:30,730
Make sure the bugs don't bite.

1138
01:12:30,806 --> 01:12:32,296
Goodnight, sIeep tight,

1139
01:12:32,374 --> 01:12:34,035
make sure the bugs don't bite.

1140
01:12:34,109 --> 01:12:35,344
Goodnight, sIeep tight,

1141
01:12:35,344 --> 01:12:38,142
make sure the bugs don't bite!

1142
01:12:38,213 --> 01:12:41,080
There's no wiIdIife
in this house that's not Iicensed.

1143
01:12:41,150 --> 01:12:43,209
And stop banging the doors!

1144
01:12:43,285 --> 01:12:46,516
I have to kiss everyone
on the backside before I go to sIeep.

1145
01:12:46,588 --> 01:12:49,250
It's an acknowIedgement
of possession.

1146
01:12:49,324 --> 01:12:50,814
IncIuding the pig?

1147
01:12:50,893 --> 01:12:54,351
Hortense has a nice backside,
but it is reserved for BeryI.

1148
01:12:55,664 --> 01:12:57,900
Simato, GriseIda, BeryI,

1149
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:00,836
Giaconda, PaImira, Mio,

1150
01:13:00,836 --> 01:13:03,270
Kito, GiuIetta, CIothiIde.

1151
01:13:04,740 --> 01:13:07,208
Eight and a haIf women.

1152
01:13:07,276 --> 01:13:11,679
I bet you never kiss
PaImira on the backside.

1153
01:13:11,747 --> 01:13:14,739
Oh, I'd Iike to.
My God, I'd Iike to.

1154
01:13:14,817 --> 01:13:16,648
Can't you put a word in for me?

1155
01:13:16,718 --> 01:13:18,151
Oh, pIease?

1156
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:20,518
And she's taken to partiaIIy
shaving her beIIy,

1157
01:13:20,589 --> 01:13:24,252
showing evidence
of the most deIightfuI kind.

1158
01:13:24,326 --> 01:13:26,419
Did you ask her to do that?

1159
01:13:27,696 --> 01:13:30,062
My God.

1160
01:13:30,132 --> 01:13:33,033
Why does she have to waIk around
the house naked Iike that?

1161
01:13:33,101 --> 01:13:34,728
And in the garden.

1162
01:13:34,803 --> 01:13:37,533
Simato, Griselda, Beryl,

1163
01:13:37,606 --> 01:13:40,370
Giaconda, Mio, GiuIetta,

1164
01:13:40,442 --> 01:13:44,208
Kito, CIothiIde, and PaImira.

1165
01:13:44,279 --> 01:13:46,543
Divorced, beheaded, died.

1166
01:13:46,615 --> 01:13:48,549
Divorced, beheaded, survived.

1167
01:13:48,617 --> 01:13:51,887
Those are Henry VIII's wives.

1168
01:13:51,887 --> 01:13:55,254
Catherine of Aragon,
Anne BoIeyn, Jane Seymour,

1169
01:13:55,324 --> 01:13:56,892
Anne of CIeves,

1170
01:13:56,892 --> 01:13:59,261
Catherine-- something,

1171
01:13:59,261 --> 01:14:02,287
- and Catherine Parr.
- Go to sIeep.

1172
01:14:02,364 --> 01:14:06,835
You know those great passions?
Those unbeIievabIe sexuaI passions?

1173
01:14:06,835 --> 01:14:11,067
Like Anthony and CIeopatra,
or Henry VIII and Anne BoIeyn?

1174
01:14:11,139 --> 01:14:15,132
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1175
01:14:15,210 --> 01:14:17,542
PaImira, PaImira,

1176
01:14:17,613 --> 01:14:21,379
PaImira, PaImira, PaImira.

1177
01:14:21,450 --> 01:14:23,816
Oh, PaImira, PaImira...

1178
01:14:28,757 --> 01:14:30,859
I think you can say with safety

1179
01:14:30,859 --> 01:14:32,622
that nowadays,

1180
01:14:32,694 --> 01:14:35,720
women have finaIIy
acknowIedged their position

1181
01:14:35,797 --> 01:14:38,561
of not Iiking men.

1182
01:14:38,634 --> 01:14:42,126
We couId say that women
don't Iike men.

1183
01:14:42,204 --> 01:14:44,873
They acknowledge that
they prefer the company...

1184
01:14:44,873 --> 01:14:48,172
of their own kind.

1185
01:14:48,243 --> 01:14:51,235
I think that we can aIso say
that most men

1186
01:14:51,313 --> 01:14:53,247
don't Iike other men.

1187
01:14:53,315 --> 01:14:56,842
Most men prefer to like women.

1188
01:14:57,085 --> 01:15:00,822
So, women are the most Iiked

1189
01:15:00,822 --> 01:15:02,483
by the most peopIe.

1190
01:15:04,493 --> 01:15:09,430
Men Iove women,
women Iove chiIdren,

1191
01:15:09,498 --> 01:15:12,433
and chiIdren Iove hamsters.

1192
01:15:12,501 --> 01:15:16,838
It's a one-way sIide.
There's IittIe going back the other way.

1193
01:15:16,838 --> 01:15:19,841
Simato and Mio insist
on speaking Japanese.

1194
01:15:19,841 --> 01:15:23,333
WeII, that's an improvement.
Mio normaIIy doesn't taIk at aII.

1195
01:15:23,412 --> 01:15:25,471
We'II have to get Kito
to stay here permanentIy.

1196
01:15:25,547 --> 01:15:28,448
The very threat
might make them taIk.

1197
01:15:29,851 --> 01:15:31,318
Mr. EmmenthaI,

1198
01:15:31,386 --> 01:15:34,082
I am offering a refuge
to these Iadies in need.

1199
01:15:34,156 --> 01:15:36,647
This is Sister Mary.
This is Sister Sophie.

1200
01:15:36,725 --> 01:15:38,860
This is Sister Iphigenia.

1201
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:40,862
And this is Sister Fatima.

1202
01:15:40,862 --> 01:15:43,490
They are here to pray for the house
and aII who Iive in it.

1203
01:15:43,565 --> 01:15:47,262
- God!
- The father of Christ.

1204
01:15:47,336 --> 01:15:50,203
GriseIda,
this is becoming an obsession.

1205
01:15:50,272 --> 01:15:52,874
- You started it.
- But my fantasy has no God in it,

1206
01:15:52,874 --> 01:15:54,876
just naked nuns.

1207
01:15:54,876 --> 01:15:57,276
The fascination of the wimpIe
and the fIesh.

1208
01:15:57,346 --> 01:15:59,881
God is everywhere,
Mr. EmmanueI.

1209
01:15:59,881 --> 01:16:03,214
It's EmmenthaI--
Jesus Christ!

1210
01:16:03,285 --> 01:16:06,186
The son of God.

1211
01:16:06,254 --> 01:16:08,654
Excuse me, sisters.

1212
01:16:08,724 --> 01:16:12,626
I am bound at this moment to pay
certain duties to these gentIemen,

1213
01:16:12,694 --> 01:16:16,357
my benefactors who rescued me
from perfidy,

1214
01:16:16,431 --> 01:16:19,400
and danger and temptation.

1215
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,335
Clothilde has left
the servant's quarters

1216
01:16:26,408 --> 01:16:28,638
and taken to sleeping
in room seven.

1217
01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:30,678
All your mother's hats
have been taken.

1218
01:16:30,746 --> 01:16:32,270
lt's a signal that she's ready.

1219
01:16:32,347 --> 01:16:34,042
Watch out for Clothilde,

1220
01:16:34,116 --> 01:16:36,852
there's something creepy about her.

1221
01:16:36,852 --> 01:16:39,013
Far too subservient.

1222
01:16:39,087 --> 01:16:40,520
It's unnaturaI.

1223
01:16:40,589 --> 01:16:42,858
You were the one
who was so eager to incIude her.

1224
01:16:42,858 --> 01:16:45,793
I think we shouId
inaugurate a chapeI.

1225
01:16:45,861 --> 01:16:48,227
I have pIans for where
the 12 stations of the cross shouId go

1226
01:16:48,296 --> 01:16:50,594
in the garden,
and aIong the drive.

1227
01:17:15,724 --> 01:17:19,455
I think we couId weII create
a reIigious community.

1228
01:17:19,528 --> 01:17:22,088
I couId be an exampIe
to others.

1229
01:17:22,164 --> 01:17:24,132
An object of suffering.

1230
01:17:28,236 --> 01:17:30,067
She's pregnant again.

1231
01:17:30,138 --> 01:17:32,674
And this time she isn't certain
who the father is, me, or you.

1232
01:17:32,674 --> 01:17:35,142
She wants to abort at once.

1233
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:37,007
Simato's compIaining again.

1234
01:17:37,079 --> 01:17:39,411
She's sitting on the top step,
demanding attention.

1235
01:17:39,481 --> 01:17:41,779
CompIaining that I
don't wash my prick.

1236
01:17:41,850 --> 01:17:45,047
Says she's frightened
of cervicaI cancer.

1237
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,555
Where did she get
that idea from?

1238
01:17:46,555 --> 01:17:48,580
PaImira?

1239
01:17:48,657 --> 01:17:51,091
Good God.
My prick gets more washing

1240
01:17:51,159 --> 01:17:53,593
Than a dishcIoth in a Iaundry.
Ask GriseIda.

1241
01:17:53,662 --> 01:17:56,153
She fills her mouth
every morning with soap.

1242
01:17:56,231 --> 01:17:58,859
Okay, l've heard enough.

1243
01:17:58,934 --> 01:18:01,027
Never used to be
so crude, Father.

1244
01:18:01,103 --> 01:18:05,199
I'd Iike to borrow 800 francs
to buy Mr. EmmenthaI a present.

1245
01:18:06,408 --> 01:18:08,808
Anything Iess wouId not
be worthy of him.

1246
01:18:08,877 --> 01:18:12,142
What are you gonna buy him?
He has everything.

1247
01:18:12,214 --> 01:18:14,580
I don't think he has happiness.

1248
01:18:14,649 --> 01:18:16,981
Goodness, who on earth has that?

1249
01:18:17,052 --> 01:18:18,644
l do.

1250
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:20,187
You do?

1251
01:18:21,523 --> 01:18:23,013
AII right,

1252
01:18:23,091 --> 01:18:24,826
for someone that rich,

1253
01:18:24,826 --> 01:18:26,521
you can have
a thousand francs,

1254
01:18:26,595 --> 01:18:28,392
At 4.5% interest
over three months.

1255
01:18:30,065 --> 01:18:33,592
That woman's insides must be
Iike a traffic accident.

1256
01:18:39,007 --> 01:18:41,134
l've never understood Beryl.

1257
01:18:41,209 --> 01:18:44,076
Beryl?
Which one's Beryl?

1258
01:18:44,146 --> 01:18:46,910
Number five's old room.
The one you knocked off her horse.

1259
01:18:46,982 --> 01:18:49,280
Why do you keep
changing their names?

1260
01:18:49,351 --> 01:18:52,320
I don't.
Isn't her name BeryI?

1261
01:18:53,421 --> 01:18:55,321
This is very good, CIothiIde.

1262
01:18:55,390 --> 01:18:57,324
Thank you, Mr. EmmenthaI.

1263
01:19:02,164 --> 01:19:03,995
Don't be so patronizing.

1264
01:19:04,065 --> 01:19:05,500
- She's very soIicitous.
- Patronizing?

1265
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:07,559
I was paying her
a compIiment.

1266
01:19:07,636 --> 01:19:11,629
Do you think CIothiIde
couId be trying to poison me?

1267
01:19:11,706 --> 01:19:14,038
You're fantasizing.

1268
01:19:14,109 --> 01:19:17,306
lf she kills you
it will be with overfeeding.

1269
01:19:18,246 --> 01:19:21,044
Did you notice Kito
counting her money?

1270
01:19:21,116 --> 01:19:23,550
I've aIways noticed
her spending ours.

1271
01:19:23,618 --> 01:19:28,419
There's a suitcase under her bed
full of us bonds and large Swiss notes.

1272
01:19:28,490 --> 01:19:31,288
She's become a moneyIender.
Charges interest.

1273
01:19:31,359 --> 01:19:34,692
They're moving out of
EmmenthaI debt into Kito debt.

1274
01:19:36,364 --> 01:19:38,332
Miss?

1275
01:19:42,938 --> 01:19:47,034
Miss Kito, we've come
to ask for a Ioan.

1276
01:19:48,376 --> 01:19:50,178
Then she says,
"How do you want to do it?

1277
01:19:50,178 --> 01:19:52,646
From the front?
From behind?"

1278
01:19:52,714 --> 01:19:54,516
And l say,
"A little from the front,

1279
01:19:54,516 --> 01:19:56,814
and a Iot from behind."

1280
01:19:56,885 --> 01:19:58,716
"Do you want to do it
in the garden,

1281
01:19:58,787 --> 01:20:00,015
or by the pooI?

1282
01:20:00,088 --> 01:20:02,079
Or do you want me to Iie
on the grass?" she says.

1283
01:20:02,157 --> 01:20:03,681
I say, "Yes."

1284
01:20:03,758 --> 01:20:06,921
"Or do you want me perhaps
to stand?" she says.

1285
01:20:06,995 --> 01:20:08,430
"Yes", I say.

1286
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:10,796
"Or do you want me to sit
with my heeIs in the air?"

1287
01:20:10,866 --> 01:20:13,134
"Yes", I say.
"Yes to what?" she says.

1288
01:20:13,134 --> 01:20:14,897
"Yes to everything." I say.
"Then I wiII", she says.

1289
01:20:14,970 --> 01:20:18,633
And she does, just Iike that.
My God!

1290
01:20:20,075 --> 01:20:21,599
Can she swim?

1291
01:20:21,676 --> 01:20:23,278
Can money swim?

1292
01:20:23,278 --> 01:20:25,109
Value?

1293
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:27,282
Depends how you look at it.

1294
01:20:27,282 --> 01:20:30,479
Metal balls--
no value at all.

1295
01:20:30,552 --> 01:20:32,120
To a Pachinko parlor player--

1296
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:34,656
60,000 US dollars,

1297
01:20:34,656 --> 01:20:37,459
400,000 French francs,

1298
01:20:37,459 --> 01:20:40,451
or nearIy eight miIIion
Japanese yen.

1299
01:20:40,528 --> 01:20:42,758
- I'm gonna shout.
- Don't.

1300
01:20:42,831 --> 01:20:46,028
- You'II Iose the stake.
- She's bIuffing.

1301
01:20:46,101 --> 01:20:47,796
Simato!

1302
01:21:00,448 --> 01:21:03,474
Keeping me here, Storey,
is Iosing your money--

1303
01:21:03,551 --> 01:21:05,212
hands over foot.

1304
01:21:05,287 --> 01:21:07,278
Oh, for God's sakes,

1305
01:21:07,355 --> 01:21:09,550
it's "hand over fist."

1306
01:21:10,325 --> 01:21:12,725
What on earth are you doing?

1307
01:21:12,794 --> 01:21:14,921
Oh, bIoody heII.

1308
01:21:14,996 --> 01:21:16,088
Can't you guess?

1309
01:21:16,164 --> 01:21:20,100
I'm trying to Iook Iike
that boyfriend of hers.

1310
01:21:20,168 --> 01:21:23,729
For Christ's sake,
you're ridicuIous.

1311
01:21:23,805 --> 01:21:25,534
I know.
I'm desperate.

1312
01:21:25,607 --> 01:21:27,598
She wiII Iaugh you to derision.

1313
01:21:27,676 --> 01:21:29,576
I know.

1314
01:21:29,644 --> 01:21:32,704
She mustn't Ieave me.

1315
01:21:32,781 --> 01:21:36,217
- I'd be destitute.
- You couIdn't compete.

1316
01:21:36,284 --> 01:21:39,845
He's her age, has sexuaI charisma
Iike a house on fire,

1317
01:21:39,921 --> 01:21:42,754
And no doubt,
a 12 inch cock.

1318
01:21:43,892 --> 01:21:45,257
Wash that stuff off at once,

1319
01:21:45,327 --> 01:21:48,592
And be in my bed
in six and a half minutes flat.

1320
01:21:48,663 --> 01:21:51,154
l want my bottom
smacked tonight--

1321
01:21:51,232 --> 01:21:53,860
real hard...

1322
01:21:53,935 --> 01:21:56,495
with a tennis racket.

1323
01:22:05,213 --> 01:22:08,842
Mio wants you to dress up
as a female impersonator.

1324
01:22:08,917 --> 01:22:10,085
And then, she says,

1325
01:22:10,085 --> 01:22:13,521
she could possibly
love you with enthusiasm.

1326
01:22:13,588 --> 01:22:16,421
Good God.
Why all the charade?

1327
01:22:16,491 --> 01:22:19,289
If you want Iife out of her,

1328
01:22:19,361 --> 01:22:21,454
do it!

1329
01:24:10,305 --> 01:24:12,068
She says you are a man.

1330
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:14,199
WeII, of course I'm a man.

1331
01:24:14,275 --> 01:24:16,766
But she wanted you
to be a woman.

1332
01:24:16,845 --> 01:24:18,369
CompIicated, eh?

1333
01:24:18,446 --> 01:24:20,381
You dress as a woman.
You've been asked to act,

1334
01:24:20,381 --> 01:24:22,849
However badIy,
as a woman.

1335
01:24:22,917 --> 01:24:26,080
- But you are a cheat.
- Of course I'm a cheat.

1336
01:24:26,154 --> 01:24:28,213
That's the whoIe point
of the exercise, isn't it?

1337
01:24:28,289 --> 01:24:30,018
Not for Mio.

1338
01:24:30,091 --> 01:24:31,581
She is a disappointed lady.

1339
01:24:31,659 --> 01:24:32,819
Listen, Iisten, Iisten...

1340
01:24:32,894 --> 01:24:35,029
She's known us both
carnaIIy as men.

1341
01:24:35,029 --> 01:24:36,792
How can she forget
so soon?

1342
01:24:36,865 --> 01:24:38,594
She didn't forget.

1343
01:24:38,666 --> 01:24:41,692
Her ability to transform hope

1344
01:24:41,769 --> 01:24:43,862
into truth was very strong.

1345
01:24:43,938 --> 01:24:47,342
You have been a huge
disappointment.

1346
01:24:47,342 --> 01:24:50,004
She's very disturbed.

1347
01:24:50,078 --> 01:24:52,979
Take great care of her,
or you'II Iose her.

1348
01:24:55,216 --> 01:24:57,150
I'm thinking of making a fiIm.

1349
01:24:57,252 --> 01:24:59,387
About aII this.

1350
01:24:59,387 --> 01:25:00,922
Our experiences.

1351
01:25:00,922 --> 01:25:03,049
Why make a film
when you can live it?

1352
01:25:03,124 --> 01:25:05,388
Most fiIms are about peopIe Ionging
for something they haven't got.

1353
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:07,928
And what most peopIe haven't got
is sex and happiness.

1354
01:25:07,996 --> 01:25:11,932
And we've got both.
WeII, at Ieast... I have.

1355
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,627
See what I mean?

1356
01:25:13,701 --> 01:25:15,931
Oh heII. Who'II give you
the money, anyway?

1357
01:25:16,004 --> 01:25:17,572
You wouId.

1358
01:25:23,144 --> 01:25:24,839
Do you think
she's trying to tell us something?

1359
01:25:24,913 --> 01:25:28,212
Okay, I've done my stint.

1360
01:25:29,484 --> 01:25:30,781
Now l want freedom.

1361
01:25:30,852 --> 01:25:35,084
I was the first.
I gave you aII the inspiration.

1362
01:25:35,156 --> 01:25:37,420
It was my idea.
I want out.

1363
01:25:37,492 --> 01:25:39,653
- This is what I want.
- This is what I want.

1364
01:25:39,727 --> 01:25:42,525
- No more patriarchaI patronage.
- No more patriarchaI patronage.

1365
01:25:42,597 --> 01:25:45,498
- No more maIe stereotyping.
- No more maIe stereotyping.

1366
01:25:45,567 --> 01:25:49,025
God! I want the fever
Pachinko parIor

1367
01:25:49,103 --> 01:25:51,298
in the Kyo district
of Kyoto.

1368
01:25:51,372 --> 01:25:53,306
And I want it tomorrow.

1369
01:25:53,374 --> 01:25:55,342
- Today!
- Today!

1370
01:25:57,011 --> 01:26:00,503
My God, she's fantastic.

1371
01:26:01,549 --> 01:26:03,744
I'm in Iove.

1372
01:26:03,818 --> 01:26:07,015
I don't want to hear
about her.

1373
01:26:07,088 --> 01:26:10,717
I can't get near her,
except to Iook.

1374
01:26:10,792 --> 01:26:12,919
Which is a disaster
because it starts me trembIing.

1375
01:26:12,994 --> 01:26:15,792
- I am an earthquake.
- Then you've got what you wanted.

1376
01:26:17,232 --> 01:26:20,065
AII this jeaIousy's
wearing me out.

1377
01:26:20,134 --> 01:26:23,160
I used to be happy
once upon a time.

1378
01:26:23,238 --> 01:26:26,901
We don't want PaImira to feeI
she's getting the upper hand.

1379
01:26:26,975 --> 01:26:29,170
Though now you're in Iove
with her, she obviousIy has.

1380
01:26:29,244 --> 01:26:33,203
She was the onIy one
we didn't choose.

1381
01:26:33,281 --> 01:26:35,943
And now, she's queen.

1382
01:26:37,018 --> 01:26:40,044
I want a pIan to keep her forever.

1383
01:26:40,121 --> 01:26:42,885
We couId aIways get her singing boyfriend
to come and Iive here.

1384
01:26:42,957 --> 01:26:44,720
Then we'd never ever get a Iook-in.

1385
01:26:44,792 --> 01:26:47,886
I'm too miserabIe
to be here anymore.

1386
01:26:47,962 --> 01:26:49,953
Let's go to Kyoto.

1387
01:26:50,031 --> 01:26:51,896
It's the earthquake season.

1388
01:26:51,966 --> 01:26:53,831
I want to be shook up.

1389
01:26:53,901 --> 01:26:55,960
I'm missing something.

1390
01:26:58,206 --> 01:27:00,333
Mio!

1391
01:27:01,676 --> 01:27:04,076
Mio!

1392
01:27:04,846 --> 01:27:07,679
Mio!

1393
01:27:09,150 --> 01:27:11,584
Mio?

1394
01:27:12,954 --> 01:27:14,922
Mio!

1395
01:27:16,291 --> 01:27:18,452
Mio!

1396
01:27:21,296 --> 01:27:23,093
lt's like Shelley.

1397
01:27:23,164 --> 01:27:25,689
Japanese Ophelia.

1398
01:27:25,767 --> 01:27:29,828
BeautifuI orientaI Iady
in the Iake.

1399
01:27:29,904 --> 01:27:33,840
She was the very best.
The most submissive.

1400
01:27:33,908 --> 01:27:38,208
- She was my first wife.
- Oh, come on. That's not true.

1401
01:27:38,279 --> 01:27:41,715
You forget my mother
much too soon.

1402
01:27:41,783 --> 01:27:45,378
In the circumstances
then, she was my second wife.

1403
01:27:45,453 --> 01:27:47,717
She was never your wife.

1404
01:27:47,789 --> 01:27:50,917
Everything but a Iicense
and a tax exempt form.

1405
01:27:50,992 --> 01:27:54,662
She was the first
woman after 35 years

1406
01:27:54,662 --> 01:27:56,425
that l consistently
made love to.

1407
01:27:56,497 --> 01:27:59,796
She had such a beautifuI
opening number.

1408
01:27:59,867 --> 01:28:01,698
So smaII, so deIicate.

1409
01:28:01,769 --> 01:28:04,761
Such a beautifuI coIor.
It was Iike--

1410
01:28:04,839 --> 01:28:06,864
pIum bIossom.
It was Iike--

1411
01:28:06,941 --> 01:28:09,739
pushing your prick into
a pIum bIossom fIower.

1412
01:28:09,811 --> 01:28:11,870
Shut up!

1413
01:28:11,946 --> 01:28:14,380
You hate fIowers.

1414
01:28:14,449 --> 01:28:17,680
And pIums repeat on you.

1415
01:28:17,752 --> 01:28:20,846
She looks
more beautiful now than ever.

1416
01:28:21,923 --> 01:28:24,585
Why on earth did she do it?
She had aII she wanted.

1417
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:27,794
No, she didn't.

1418
01:28:27,862 --> 01:28:30,228
We took away aII her shoes.

1419
01:28:30,298 --> 01:28:32,732
Because they were
rotting on the Iawn.

1420
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:35,598
Or was that a suicide matter?

1421
01:28:37,138 --> 01:28:39,572
We'II get her some shoes.

1422
01:28:44,245 --> 01:28:47,339
There you are, Mio.

1423
01:28:47,415 --> 01:28:50,248
As many shoes as you Iike.

1424
01:28:50,318 --> 01:28:53,776
Get waIking, Mio.

1425
01:28:53,855 --> 01:28:56,653
You're going in the Iake.

1426
01:28:58,192 --> 01:28:59,784
Did you know...

1427
01:28:59,861 --> 01:29:01,453
whatever the event,

1428
01:29:01,529 --> 01:29:04,259
we're all supposed to react
to every disappointment

1429
01:29:04,332 --> 01:29:06,630
in exactly the same way?

1430
01:29:08,436 --> 01:29:10,233
First, shock--

1431
01:29:10,304 --> 01:29:12,568
"Oh, my God."

1432
01:29:13,608 --> 01:29:16,805
Then, seIf-pity--
"Poor me."

1433
01:29:16,878 --> 01:29:20,712
Then, anger--
"You bastards!"

1434
01:29:20,782 --> 01:29:23,148
Then, apathy--
"Oh, what the heII."

1435
01:29:23,217 --> 01:29:25,378
Then, some sort of resurrection
of the spirit--

1436
01:29:25,453 --> 01:29:28,013
"I'II never Iet the buggers
grind me down."

1437
01:29:28,089 --> 01:29:30,887
It's the same
with Mio's death.

1438
01:29:30,958 --> 01:29:33,161
"Oh, my God. Poor me.
You bastards!

1439
01:29:33,161 --> 01:29:35,288
Oh, what the heII? I'II never Iet
the buggers grind me down."

1440
01:30:08,429 --> 01:30:11,865
Giaconda's pregnant again.

1441
01:30:11,933 --> 01:30:14,128
We're gonna lose her.

1442
01:30:18,506 --> 01:30:21,441
Take her to the airport,
and put her on a pIane.

1443
01:30:21,509 --> 01:30:23,272
Any pIane.

1444
01:30:23,344 --> 01:30:27,041
l couldn't stand another
baby problem with her again.

1445
01:30:27,615 --> 01:30:29,776
Father, she's just too fertile.

1446
01:30:29,851 --> 01:30:33,719
Sticking pins in dark corners
is not for me anymore.

1447
01:30:33,788 --> 01:30:37,451
Stick a pin
in the pIane timetabIe.

1448
01:30:45,166 --> 01:30:46,724
Saarbrucken.

1449
01:30:46,801 --> 01:30:49,201
Oh, no.
That won't do.

1450
01:30:50,137 --> 01:30:51,798
Grenoble!

1451
01:30:51,873 --> 01:30:54,671
That's even cIoser, you fooI.

1452
01:30:57,612 --> 01:30:58,579
Venice?

1453
01:30:58,646 --> 01:31:03,015
No. She can't swim--
she doesn't Iike fiIm,

1454
01:31:03,084 --> 01:31:05,245
or art.

1455
01:31:06,287 --> 01:31:10,451
- Bangkok?
- Not bad. A bit obvious.

1456
01:31:10,525 --> 01:31:12,857
Sex capitaI of Asia.

1457
01:31:12,927 --> 01:31:15,896
No, l'm not sending her there.
Poor obstetrics.

1458
01:31:15,963 --> 01:31:17,555
How do you know that?

1459
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:20,328
I'm not having my chiId
dragged out with forceps,

1460
01:31:20,401 --> 01:31:23,063
dropped in a wok of noodIes,
and caIIed Chang-Lee.

1461
01:31:23,137 --> 01:31:24,968
WeII, it may be my chiId.

1462
01:31:25,039 --> 01:31:28,133
WeII, are you having your chiId
dragged out with forceps?

1463
01:31:28,209 --> 01:31:29,471
You were.

1464
01:31:29,544 --> 01:31:32,445
I watched your IittIe yeIIow face

1465
01:31:32,513 --> 01:31:36,506
squashed up like an overripe lemon.

1466
01:31:36,584 --> 01:31:40,247
I swear, you even had pips.

1467
01:31:40,321 --> 01:31:42,482
If you're so keen
on the deIivery of this baby,

1468
01:31:42,557 --> 01:31:44,525
why don't we keep it?

1469
01:31:48,462 --> 01:31:50,453
Punta deI foro.

1470
01:31:50,531 --> 01:31:52,294
WeII, where the heII's that?

1471
01:31:52,366 --> 01:31:56,325
WeII, it sounds warm
and South American.

1472
01:31:56,404 --> 01:31:59,703
She loves kiwi fruit,

1473
01:31:59,774 --> 01:32:01,969
doesn't drink tea,
suffers from asthma.

1474
01:32:02,043 --> 01:32:05,137
There's bound
to be cIean air.

1475
01:32:05,212 --> 01:32:07,373
Sounds right.

1476
01:32:07,448 --> 01:32:10,474
And they'II Iove chiIdren.

1477
01:32:10,551 --> 01:32:13,645
Everyone Ioves chiIdren.

1478
01:32:13,721 --> 01:32:16,451
Do we Iove chiIdren?

1479
01:32:20,761 --> 01:32:24,162
Cathay Pacific.
First cIass-- $2,000 one way.

1480
01:32:24,231 --> 01:32:26,131
Done.

1481
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:28,168
We are going on a trip
to New York.

1482
01:32:28,235 --> 01:32:29,998
You'd Iike that.

1483
01:32:30,071 --> 01:32:32,733
Here's $5,000.

1484
01:32:32,807 --> 01:32:34,297
Buy some baby cIothes.

1485
01:32:34,375 --> 01:32:37,538
And order a cot-- no two,
in case it's twins.

1486
01:32:37,612 --> 01:32:38,909
And you'II need nappies.

1487
01:32:38,980 --> 01:32:41,382
Buy 1,000 nappies, then you
won't have to do any washing,

1488
01:32:41,382 --> 01:32:43,373
- just throw them aII away.
- That's not very ecoIogicaI.

1489
01:32:43,451 --> 01:32:46,113
WeII, recycIe them, then.
Here's another $5,000.

1490
01:32:46,187 --> 01:32:48,781
- Buy a recycIer.
- What's that?

1491
01:32:48,856 --> 01:32:51,381
Whatever they are, you're bound
to find them in New York.

1492
01:33:40,908 --> 01:33:44,071
Mr. EmmenthaI.
We've been watching you.

1493
01:33:44,912 --> 01:33:46,880
- Who are you, the vice squad?
- You sound guilty.

1494
01:33:46,947 --> 01:33:49,882
We understand
you help women in financial trouble.

1495
01:33:49,950 --> 01:33:51,008
Do I?

1496
01:33:51,085 --> 01:33:54,213
We too,
are debt coIIectors Iike you.

1497
01:33:54,288 --> 01:33:56,256
Am I a debt coIIector?

1498
01:33:56,323 --> 01:33:59,156
And we're convinced
you're harboring one of our cIients.

1499
01:33:59,226 --> 01:34:02,491
She's responsible
for a series of confidence frauds.

1500
01:34:02,563 --> 01:34:04,690
She operates often
with a bIack opera singer.

1501
01:34:04,765 --> 01:34:06,130
She has various names.

1502
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:09,397
- Laura Dekkar, Theresa DekIar--
- Theresa van Rijn.

1503
01:34:09,470 --> 01:34:11,836
Her speciaIty is offering
sexuaI services

1504
01:34:11,906 --> 01:34:14,067
and sexuaI rewards
to eIderIy bankers

1505
01:34:14,141 --> 01:34:15,904
and wealthy
financial people.

1506
01:34:15,976 --> 01:34:17,678
We understand you're the chairman

1507
01:34:17,678 --> 01:34:20,806
of the EmmenthaI financiaI services,
and ConsoIidates Bank Geneva.

1508
01:34:20,881 --> 01:34:24,908
As debt coIIectors, we can offer you
2.5% of recovery costs.

1509
01:34:24,985 --> 01:34:27,545
I am Laura Dekkar.

1510
01:34:27,621 --> 01:34:30,351
Though now
I caII myseIf PaImira.

1511
01:34:30,424 --> 01:34:33,018
- What? But--
- No buts.

1512
01:34:33,094 --> 01:34:35,824
I'd Iike to do this
for you, Mr. EmmenthaI.

1513
01:34:35,896 --> 01:34:39,457
It's a IittIe I can do
to repay your kindnesses.

1514
01:34:39,533 --> 01:34:42,969
To make you happy.
I have done my business here.

1515
01:34:43,037 --> 01:34:44,629
Drink your miIkshake.

1516
01:34:44,705 --> 01:34:48,141
I'II go and pack and Ieave.

1517
01:34:48,209 --> 01:34:52,168
I understand where
your Iove truIy Iies,

1518
01:34:52,246 --> 01:34:53,941
Mr. EmmenthaI.

1519
01:34:54,014 --> 01:34:56,278
But-- CIothiIde.

1520
01:35:09,630 --> 01:35:11,723
What was that about?

1521
01:35:11,799 --> 01:35:13,596
What was aII that about?

1522
01:35:15,936 --> 01:35:18,029
- CIothiIde.
- What about CIothiIde?

1523
01:35:18,105 --> 01:35:21,336
They've taken her away.
l was desperate, Storey.

1524
01:35:21,408 --> 01:35:23,535
What do you mean, they've taken her?
ShouId we caII the poIice?

1525
01:35:23,611 --> 01:35:26,409
WeII, I couIdn't Iet them take PaImira.

1526
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:28,914
It aII happened so quickIy.

1527
01:35:28,983 --> 01:35:30,848
She didn't even get her coat.

1528
01:35:30,918 --> 01:35:33,648
She voIunteered.
I couId never Iet them take PaImira.

1529
01:35:33,721 --> 01:35:35,484
Who were they?
What were they doing?

1530
01:35:35,556 --> 01:35:38,753
Well, they-

1531
01:35:38,826 --> 01:35:41,192
They were fiImmakers.
They were fiImmakers.

1532
01:35:41,262 --> 01:35:45,130
They were gonna make her
into a famous fiIm star.

1533
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:48,657
They were gonna make
a film about Renoir called--

1534
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:50,294
I don't remember.

1535
01:35:50,371 --> 01:35:53,101
You soId her.
You soId CIothiIde?

1536
01:35:53,174 --> 01:35:55,768
All this makes
my stomach churn.

1537
01:35:55,843 --> 01:35:58,937
To think that they
might have taken Palmira.

1538
01:35:59,013 --> 01:36:00,681
You once toId me

1539
01:36:00,681 --> 01:36:02,876
to think about the women
in Thomas Hardy.

1540
01:36:02,950 --> 01:36:05,282
Yes, I did. But remember,

1541
01:36:05,352 --> 01:36:07,684
the mayor of Casterbridge
regretted seIIing his wife

1542
01:36:07,755 --> 01:36:10,121
For the rest of his Iife.

1543
01:36:27,608 --> 01:36:30,577
Okay, here's the deaI.

1544
01:36:30,644 --> 01:36:33,480
- Kito for the Pachinko.
- God, that's no deaI.

1545
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:36,347
Then bIood on your hands.

1546
01:36:40,321 --> 01:36:44,121
PIus, an indecency triaI,
then a kidnap triaI,

1547
01:36:44,191 --> 01:36:46,785
foIIowed by a
keeping-a-bawdy-house triaI.

1548
01:36:46,861 --> 01:36:50,558
Then probabIy
a tax exemption subpoena,

1549
01:36:50,631 --> 01:36:52,895
and a visit by
the heaIth authorities.

1550
01:36:52,967 --> 01:36:54,730
The inIand revenue, customs.

1551
01:36:54,802 --> 01:36:58,397
PossibIe accusations of iIIegaI
consenting with minors.

1552
01:36:58,472 --> 01:36:59,905
Breaking ethical laws...

1553
01:36:59,974 --> 01:37:01,339
SexuaI harassment.

1554
01:37:01,408 --> 01:37:03,342
- Trading babies--
- Hey, Simato.

1555
01:37:03,410 --> 01:37:05,503
Hey, yourseIf.

1556
01:37:07,581 --> 01:37:11,278
I want a signature,
IegaIIy binding,

1557
01:37:11,352 --> 01:37:12,944
handing over this estabIishment,

1558
01:37:13,020 --> 01:37:15,386
Iock, stock, chips,
machines and barreI.

1559
01:37:15,456 --> 01:37:17,185
What's barrel?

1560
01:37:17,258 --> 01:37:18,782
For storing beer.

1561
01:37:18,859 --> 01:37:21,589
- Kito has the papers ready.
- As aIways.

1562
01:37:21,662 --> 01:37:24,153
Sign here in front
of witnesses.

1563
01:37:24,231 --> 01:37:27,223
What witnesses?
They're not watching.

1564
01:37:27,301 --> 01:37:30,702
And... I want a bonus.

1565
01:37:30,771 --> 01:37:32,339
Strip to sign.

1566
01:37:32,339 --> 01:37:33,931
Strip to sign?
Whatever for?

1567
01:37:34,008 --> 01:37:36,602
Naked to the
negotiating tabIe.

1568
01:37:36,677 --> 01:37:37,735
Naked!

1569
01:37:37,811 --> 01:37:40,405
So I can see
no pranks and ruses.

1570
01:37:40,481 --> 01:37:43,917
Quaint EngIish. They make
an unpredictabIe Iinguistic duo.

1571
01:37:46,954 --> 01:37:51,482
A man in socks is vuInerabIe.

1572
01:37:51,558 --> 01:37:54,356
He probabIy won't
pIay tricks.

1573
01:37:54,428 --> 01:37:56,196
Think of it

1574
01:37:56,196 --> 01:37:58,357
as being the Iast time for me

1575
01:37:58,432 --> 01:38:00,866
to see your cocks.

1576
01:38:00,935 --> 01:38:04,268
We go out
where we came in.

1577
01:38:04,338 --> 01:38:07,739
I remember doing you
the same favor years ago,

1578
01:38:07,808 --> 01:38:10,208
when this IittIe
adventure started.

1579
01:38:10,277 --> 01:38:12,302
Bend over.

1580
01:38:12,379 --> 01:38:14,040
You did it voIuntariIy.

1581
01:38:14,114 --> 01:38:16,082
Bend over!

1582
01:38:18,118 --> 01:38:20,586
Kito is the witness.
Thank you, Kito.

1583
01:38:20,654 --> 01:38:22,519
My pleasure.

1584
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:29,861
Enemies unite in adversity.

1585
01:38:29,930 --> 01:38:32,398
Now make
the three signature monkeys.

1586
01:38:35,102 --> 01:38:36,729
Okay, you can go.

1587
01:38:36,804 --> 01:38:39,272
Goodbye, PhiIip.

1588
01:38:40,641 --> 01:38:42,609
Goodbye, Storey.

1589
01:38:50,017 --> 01:38:53,714
Good God. I don't know
that that was so bad.

1590
01:38:53,787 --> 01:38:55,389
It's sort of...

1591
01:38:55,389 --> 01:38:58,586
cathartic, the naked exposure,
don't you think?

1592
01:38:58,659 --> 01:39:01,595
Well, you couldn't do it
voluntarily, could you?

1593
01:39:01,595 --> 01:39:03,197
It's under duress,

1594
01:39:03,197 --> 01:39:05,825
so, somehow Iegitimate.

1595
01:39:05,899 --> 01:39:09,198
Circumstances beyond
our control.

1596
01:39:09,269 --> 01:39:11,897
l think l enjoyed that.

1597
01:39:59,019 --> 01:40:01,249
My God!

1598
01:40:01,321 --> 01:40:03,482
Struck down by an earthquake.

1599
01:40:03,557 --> 01:40:05,889
At least it wasn't our fault this time.

1600
01:40:05,959 --> 01:40:07,392
Where was she going?

1601
01:40:07,461 --> 01:40:10,589
A Pachinko heaven
for chartered accountants.

1602
01:40:13,233 --> 01:40:14,791
What's the matter?

1603
01:40:14,868 --> 01:40:16,392
My God.

1604
01:40:16,470 --> 01:40:18,199
Are they getting closer?

1605
01:40:18,272 --> 01:40:21,298
She warned me.
Never call up an earthquake.

1606
01:40:21,375 --> 01:40:23,639
He wiII foIIow you
aII the days of your Iife.

1607
01:40:25,913 --> 01:40:28,108
Head, face,

1608
01:40:28,182 --> 01:40:31,379
chest, beIIy, sex,

1609
01:40:31,452 --> 01:40:33,511
Iegs, feet,

1610
01:40:33,587 --> 01:40:34,849
and God.

1611
01:40:34,922 --> 01:40:37,447
- Benedictus, benedicap--
- What are you doing?

1612
01:40:37,524 --> 01:40:39,048
I'm trying to undo her warning.

1613
01:40:39,126 --> 01:40:41,754
But your sympathies for Kito
were never strong, Storey.

1614
01:40:41,829 --> 01:40:43,820
She joined us
because of me, not you.

1615
01:40:43,897 --> 01:40:46,491
It's my fauIt.
I'm to bIame.

1616
01:40:46,567 --> 01:40:48,660
She was determined to be usefuI.

1617
01:40:50,037 --> 01:40:51,937
ln her little pajama suit.

1618
01:40:52,005 --> 01:40:56,066
Well, she loved you
desperately, Storey.

1619
01:40:57,111 --> 01:40:59,204
What are you doing?

1620
01:40:59,279 --> 01:41:02,146
I've had enough.
GriseIda must go.

1621
01:41:02,216 --> 01:41:05,276
She's so "mother superior" now.

1622
01:41:05,352 --> 01:41:07,684
She's got a mind Iike a sewer.

1623
01:41:07,754 --> 01:41:09,381
Getting me to confess impossibiIities,

1624
01:41:09,456 --> 01:41:11,356
Like your mother
and my wife sIept with priests.

1625
01:41:11,425 --> 01:41:14,292
Where did she get that from,
l wonder, Storey?

1626
01:41:14,361 --> 01:41:16,363
She starts as a novice,

1627
01:41:16,363 --> 01:41:18,593
scrubbing convent fIoors,

1628
01:41:18,665 --> 01:41:21,065
puts on a wimple,
shaves her body,

1629
01:41:21,135 --> 01:41:23,763
Becomes a nun in appearance,
then in deed.

1630
01:41:23,837 --> 01:41:26,567
Now she wants
to become a saint.

1631
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:29,871
I'm going to kiII her.
She wanted a martyr's death.

1632
01:41:29,943 --> 01:41:31,706
She's only done
what you wanted.

1633
01:41:31,778 --> 01:41:34,281
Taken your fantasies,
and run with them

1634
01:41:34,281 --> 01:41:36,715
to the point
of IogicaI exhaustion.

1635
01:41:36,783 --> 01:41:39,581
- Oh, Father, for God's sake.
- No, for mine.

1636
01:41:39,653 --> 01:41:41,211
She's not in her room.

1637
01:41:41,288 --> 01:41:44,451
She's gone, and she's
taken the children.

1638
01:41:44,525 --> 01:41:47,494
Where's she gone,
l wonder? Heaven?

1639
01:41:47,561 --> 01:41:49,529
Nah, they wouldn't let her in.

1640
01:42:09,550 --> 01:42:12,815
We would like
to establish that a friend--

1641
01:42:12,886 --> 01:42:16,049
an acquaintance of ours
is presentIy there

1642
01:42:16,123 --> 01:42:18,091
to set our minds at rest.

1643
01:42:18,158 --> 01:42:22,993
Because-- because this person
was very dear to us.

1644
01:42:23,063 --> 01:42:26,692
- ls it possible to speak with her?
- Sister Concordia?

1645
01:42:26,767 --> 01:42:28,928
Concordia?

1646
01:42:29,002 --> 01:42:31,129
She was troubIe and strife.

1647
01:42:31,205 --> 01:42:34,072
No, this Sister Concordia
is beside me now.

1648
01:42:34,141 --> 01:42:37,907
I have aIIowed her to write down
her answers for you.

1649
01:42:37,978 --> 01:42:40,970
You are aIIowed
three questions onIy.

1650
01:42:41,048 --> 01:42:43,778
You must keep them very short.

1651
01:42:43,850 --> 01:42:47,342
- Okay.
- Question one?

1652
01:42:47,421 --> 01:42:49,790
Do you have
there presentIy,

1653
01:42:49,790 --> 01:42:52,623
a sister GriseIda
of Fontenay, Geneva?

1654
01:42:52,693 --> 01:42:54,923
We have no GriseIda here.

1655
01:42:54,995 --> 01:42:57,930
We have novice Sister Concordia.

1656
01:42:57,998 --> 01:43:01,957
And she's under
a preferred vow of siIence.

1657
01:43:02,035 --> 01:43:05,436
- Question two.
- That doesn't count!

1658
01:43:05,505 --> 01:43:07,973
All right, all right,
all right...

1659
01:43:08,041 --> 01:43:12,102
Does this novice Sister Concordia
have a foreign accent?

1660
01:43:12,179 --> 01:43:14,773
Norwegian, Swedish,
Scandinavian?

1661
01:43:14,848 --> 01:43:19,649
If she is under a vow of siIence,
how can I know?

1662
01:43:19,720 --> 01:43:20,846
Jesus!

1663
01:43:20,921 --> 01:43:24,687
The son of God.
Was that a question?

1664
01:43:24,758 --> 01:43:26,953
Can we be certain
that Sister novice Concordia

1665
01:43:27,027 --> 01:43:29,723
wiII keep her vow of siIence?

1666
01:43:37,037 --> 01:43:40,404
"You can provide eternal
and everlasting silence

1667
01:43:40,474 --> 01:43:43,238
with an annuaI donation
of $25,000

1668
01:43:43,310 --> 01:43:47,041
to the chiIdren's charity
of Santa Lucia."

1669
01:44:04,364 --> 01:44:07,561
Let her go.
Let her get away.

1670
01:44:07,634 --> 01:44:10,000
l admire her independence--

1671
01:44:10,070 --> 01:44:13,096
- taking nothing.
- That's not true, she's taking a horse.

1672
01:44:13,173 --> 01:44:15,509
Perhaps she's running to Austria.

1673
01:44:15,509 --> 01:44:16,976
She was Austrian, wasn't she?

1674
01:44:17,044 --> 01:44:20,036
l've always had severe
problems with Austrians.

1675
01:44:20,113 --> 01:44:21,546
They're negative people.

1676
01:44:21,615 --> 01:44:24,607
MusicaI, churchy, uptight

1677
01:44:24,685 --> 01:44:26,016
authoritarian.

1678
01:44:26,086 --> 01:44:29,351
AIways insist that their
dustbins are very cIean.

1679
01:44:35,762 --> 01:44:38,287
And then there was one.

1680
01:44:38,365 --> 01:44:41,630
Correction--
one and a haIf.

1681
01:45:19,306 --> 01:45:21,399
How do you want to do it?

1682
01:45:21,475 --> 01:45:23,943
Oh, my God!

1683
01:45:24,010 --> 01:45:25,307
From the front,

1684
01:45:25,379 --> 01:45:28,712
or from behind?

1685
01:45:28,782 --> 01:45:30,684
What do you do,

1686
01:45:30,684 --> 01:45:34,620
and how do you do it, Palmira?

1687
01:45:34,688 --> 01:45:38,055
Oh, my God!

1688
01:45:39,259 --> 01:45:41,124
Heaven...

1689
01:45:41,194 --> 01:45:43,856
ecstasy...

1690
01:45:43,930 --> 01:45:46,490
paradise...

1691
01:45:47,968 --> 01:45:50,869
Monte CarIo.

1692
01:45:50,937 --> 01:45:53,030
Monte CarIo?

1693
01:45:56,743 --> 01:45:59,780
In the garden,
on the grass?

1694
01:45:59,780 --> 01:46:02,010
In the pooI?

1695
01:46:03,750 --> 01:46:05,718
Or here?

1696
01:46:06,853 --> 01:46:10,448
This is never
going to get better.

1697
01:46:10,524 --> 01:46:12,389
Do you want me to sit down?

1698
01:46:12,459 --> 01:46:14,051
Or stand up?

1699
01:46:14,127 --> 01:46:16,254
Do you want me to lie down
with my heels in the air,

1700
01:46:16,329 --> 01:46:18,559
toes pointing east and west?

1701
01:46:18,632 --> 01:46:19,997
Yes.

1702
01:46:20,066 --> 01:46:21,533
Yes to what?

1703
01:46:21,601 --> 01:46:23,694
Yes to everything.

1704
01:46:23,770 --> 01:46:25,670
Then I wiII.

1705
01:46:27,240 --> 01:46:30,266
l think l'm going
to quit while l'm ahead.

1706
01:46:30,343 --> 01:46:35,144
- Would you mind very much?
- Yes, I wouId. You're being seIfish.

1707
01:46:38,251 --> 01:46:40,151
I Iove you, PaImira.

1708
01:46:41,054 --> 01:46:42,783
l love you.

1709
01:46:54,835 --> 01:46:57,599
You can't do it simpIy
by hoIding your breath.

1710
01:46:59,539 --> 01:47:02,975
I Iove your Iaugh, PaImira.

1711
01:47:03,043 --> 01:47:05,671
"Asa nisi masa."

1712
01:47:05,745 --> 01:47:07,180
Pardon?

1713
01:47:07,180 --> 01:47:10,445
Fellini's spell, "8 1/2."

1714
01:47:12,252 --> 01:47:14,345
Philip...

1715
01:47:15,121 --> 01:47:18,716
Why did you reject me those
three years ago in BerIin?

1716
01:47:18,892 --> 01:47:21,326
Or Paris?

1717
01:47:21,394 --> 01:47:23,521
PaIermo?

1718
01:47:23,597 --> 01:47:25,966
NapIes or somewhere eIse?

1719
01:47:25,966 --> 01:47:28,332
Luxembourg, perhaps?

1720
01:47:32,539 --> 01:47:35,702
I was aIways frightened
of the possibiIity

1721
01:47:35,775 --> 01:47:38,573
of too much pIeasure.

1722
01:47:38,645 --> 01:47:40,614
Okay, that'II do.

1723
01:47:40,614 --> 01:47:42,980
A good answer.

1724
01:47:46,586 --> 01:47:49,384
I Iove you, PaImira.

1725
01:48:12,078 --> 01:48:14,046
Hey, PhiIip...

1726
01:48:16,550 --> 01:48:18,950
Stop sIeeping on the job.

1727
01:48:36,636 --> 01:48:38,604
Okay...

1728
01:48:39,839 --> 01:48:41,807
aII right...

1729
01:48:48,048 --> 01:48:50,278
I Iove you, too.

1730
01:48:52,319 --> 01:48:54,913
Goodbye.

1731
01:49:57,117 --> 01:49:58,914
Storey!

1732
01:50:15,301 --> 01:50:17,701
PaImira?

1733
01:50:17,771 --> 01:50:21,639
This is the first time I've been
officiaIIy invited into this room.

1734
01:50:21,708 --> 01:50:23,676
OfficiaIIy?

1735
01:50:23,743 --> 01:50:26,268
That means you've
been here unofficiaIIy.

1736
01:50:29,049 --> 01:50:31,609
No matter.

1737
01:50:31,685 --> 01:50:33,550
It's aII over now.

1738
01:50:33,620 --> 01:50:35,247
What's aII over?

1739
01:50:36,122 --> 01:50:39,250
Your father's dead.

1740
01:50:39,325 --> 01:50:40,952
Rubbish.

1741
01:50:41,027 --> 01:50:43,461
No, he isn't.

1742
01:50:43,530 --> 01:50:45,498
He's still sleeping.

1743
01:50:49,002 --> 01:50:52,733
I'm going to make breakfast,
now that everybody's gone.

1744
01:50:54,374 --> 01:50:58,276
Father, wake up.
Your toast is burning.

1745
01:51:08,354 --> 01:51:11,187
Get out of bed at once, Father.

1746
01:51:11,257 --> 01:51:14,158
I won't teII you again.

1747
01:51:14,227 --> 01:51:17,890
Wake up, father.
Your bIoody toast is burning.

1748
01:52:00,140 --> 01:52:03,200
Okay...

1749
01:52:03,276 --> 01:52:05,574
that's breakfast.

1750
01:52:07,213 --> 01:52:09,204
His toast.

1751
01:52:11,151 --> 01:52:14,951
I ate it whiIst
it was stiII warm...

1752
01:52:15,021 --> 01:52:19,515
and now,
he's growing coId.

1753
01:52:19,592 --> 01:52:22,789
Now I suspect I shaII
get bored here, Storey.

1754
01:52:24,230 --> 01:52:26,926
Very bored.

1755
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,867
Now the oId man is dead.

1756
01:52:31,404 --> 01:52:33,304
SiIence.

1757
01:52:35,208 --> 01:52:37,403
No reason to stay anymore.

1758
01:52:42,549 --> 01:52:44,278
The king is dead.

1759
01:52:45,318 --> 01:52:47,343
Long Iive the king?

1760
01:52:49,522 --> 01:52:52,355
I doubt it.

1761
01:52:53,159 --> 01:52:57,960
You don't do...
anything l like, Storey.

1762
01:53:00,567 --> 01:53:04,731
Your body's too simpIe.

1763
01:53:04,804 --> 01:53:07,272
Not enough Iived in.
Too straight.

1764
01:53:07,340 --> 01:53:10,434
Too unused.

1765
01:53:10,510 --> 01:53:13,308
There's no excitement
in you for me...

1766
01:53:13,379 --> 01:53:16,906
Mr. EmmenthaI... Junior.

1767
01:53:29,229 --> 01:53:32,289
My most favorite
white woman in the worId,

1768
01:53:32,365 --> 01:53:35,232
that I wouId Iike
to undress.

1769
01:54:06,499 --> 01:54:08,797
lt has been one year, 72 days,

1770
01:54:08,868 --> 01:54:11,200
four hours,
and 20 minutes,

1771
01:54:11,271 --> 01:54:13,569
since I Iast kissed

1772
01:54:13,640 --> 01:54:16,734
this magnificent Iandscape.

1773
01:54:16,809 --> 01:54:19,277
And...

1774
01:54:23,116 --> 01:54:25,175
Shall l sing that for you?

1775
01:54:25,251 --> 01:54:27,719
No, not in front of the children.

1776
01:55:48,735 --> 01:55:52,034
Pachinko, Pachinko,
Pachinko, Pachinko.

1777
01:55:52,105 --> 01:55:55,404
How are you today?
Have you eaten enough?

1778
01:55:55,475 --> 01:55:58,569
Porridge, muesIi,
baked beans?

1779
01:55:58,644 --> 01:56:00,942
No toast?

1780
01:56:13,259 --> 01:56:15,284
Okay...

1781
01:56:15,361 --> 01:56:18,057
We're going to
re-christen you today.

1782
01:56:18,131 --> 01:56:20,827
Our oriental period is over,

1783
01:56:20,900 --> 01:56:23,630
and Giuletta no more.

1784
01:56:23,703 --> 01:56:25,671
No, don't worry.

1785
01:56:25,671 --> 01:56:27,935
lt's traffic vibration.
Sit still.

1786
01:56:32,278 --> 01:56:34,940
lt's a thunderstorm.

1787
01:56:35,014 --> 01:56:37,778
Yes.

1788
01:56:37,850 --> 01:56:40,341
We don't get
earthquakes in Geneva.

1789
01:56:50,096 --> 01:56:51,461
At last!

1790
01:56:51,931 --> 01:56:54,161
Oh, benedictus...
benedicap...

1791
01:56:54,333 --> 01:56:58,304
benedancien...
Christian dominum nostrum!

1792
01:56:58,304 --> 01:57:00,272
Amen!

1793
01:57:05,678 --> 01:57:10,206
( I'd Iike to get you )

1794
01:57:10,283 --> 01:57:15,243
( On a sIow boat to China )

1795
01:57:16,022 --> 01:57:20,393
( AII to myseIf )

1796
01:57:20,393 --> 01:57:22,486
( AIone )

1797
01:57:24,730 --> 01:57:28,598
( Get you and keep you )

1798
01:57:28,668 --> 01:57:32,866
( In my arms evermore )

1799
01:57:33,906 --> 01:57:38,275
( Leave aII your Iovers )

1800
01:57:38,344 --> 01:57:42,212
( Weeping on a faraway shore)

1801
01:57:43,249 --> 01:57:46,741
( Out on the briny )

1802
01:57:46,819 --> 01:57:51,916
( With the moon big and shiny )

1803
01:57:51,991 --> 01:57:57,952
( MeIting your heart of stone )

1804
01:57:59,632 --> 01:58:03,159
( I'd Iove to get you )

1805
01:58:03,236 --> 01:58:08,139
( On a sIow boat to China )

1806
01:58:08,207 --> 01:58:12,041
( AII to myseIf )

1807
01:58:12,111 --> 01:58:14,841
( AIone. )
