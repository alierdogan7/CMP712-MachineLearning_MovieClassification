David?

26
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,287
Hello, Jenny.

27
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,957
Is this awfully inconvenient?

28
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:20,875
I don't think so.

29
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:21,952
Come on up.

30
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,760
I'll take your coat.

DAVID: That's for social calls.

32
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,862
Well, you did say this was business,
didn't you?

33
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,816
Yes, Doctor. Business.

34
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,493
Well, the business department is in here.

35
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,582
Why do they call you "mister"
if you're a doctor?

36
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,335
- Surgeons are called "mister."
- I see.

37
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,633
You mean, like a marquis
being called a "lord."

38
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,011
That always mixes me up, too.

39
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,341
Secrets of the trade.

40
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,926
Would you sit down?

41
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,259
- Yes, thank you.
- Now then, what is it?

42
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,769
Ear, nose or throat?

43
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,515
Do you take care
of all three of those things?

44
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:25,682
Yes.

45
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:28,727
Which is it?

46
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,947
Were you surprised to hear from me?

47
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,448
A little.

48
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,782
You sang this afternoon.
Charity concert, wasn't it?

49
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,405
Yes. How did you know?

50
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,582
It was in all the papers.

51
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:44,876
How did it go?

52
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,162
Oh, it was ghastly.

53
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,643
- That means it was good.
- No, it was terrible. It was awful.

54
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,299
My throat was very raw and I couldn't...

55
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,004
I... I just sort of croaked out
the performance.

56
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,764
Tell me, am I keeping
this secretary person of yours?

57
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,637
No, no. She works here.

58
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,560
I know, but it's terribly late
and it's Sunday, and I thought...

59
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:03,720
She's used to it.

60
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,224
Will you go on?

61
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,066
Well, I just...

62
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:13,857
I just got scared
I was going to lose my voice.

63
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,907
Mmm-hmm. Since when?

64
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,110
Since when, what?

65
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,616
Since when were you soared
that you were losing your voice?

66
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,326
Oh, um...

67
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,412
Well, since I got to England.

68
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:33,834
And don't tell me it's the climate
because Tebaldi and Callas sing here

69
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,089
and they do very well.

70
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,012
Should we take a look?

71
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,088
All right.

72
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,847
Would you come over here, please?

73
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,262
Yes.

00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,596
DAVID: Sit down.

75
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,391
How are your sinuses?

76
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,316
- Oh, I don't know. They're kind of...
- DAVID: Any cold recently?

77
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,945
- No.
- You used to have a lot of colds.

78
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,111
Yes, but then they invented
paper handkerchiefs

79
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,488
and sort of took the fun out of it.

80
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,161
Would you, um, open your mouth, please?

81
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:04,406
Wide.

82
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,158
Thank you.

83
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,078
- Say, "Aah".
- Aah.

00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,884
Now I'm going to have a look
at your larynx.

86
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,812
- I'm going to take this piece of gauze...
- Gauze...

87
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:21,090
And you're going to hold my tongue with it,
and you want me to relax

88
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:24,635
and breathe slowly in and out
and completely...

89
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,265
- Would you just do it?
- Yes, I will.

90
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,397
Thank you. Would you put out your tongue?

91
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,479
Yes, thank you.

92
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:38,691
You know, I've been thinking...

93
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,276
Would you just sit there, please,
for a moment?

94
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,156
Would you come back?

95
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:47,699
All right.

96
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,159
Excuse me.

97
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,677
I've been thinking about Atlantic City.

98
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,681
Do you ever think about
Atlantic City, David?

99
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,592
Yes, I have done.

100
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,476
Does this hurt?

101
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,600
Mmm-mmm.

102
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,099
Would you swallow?

103
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,693

What do you think?

107
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,048
You mean, there's nothing wrong with me?

108
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,625
Your throat's a bit rough, it's red.

109
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,788
You've been singing
and you've been smoking too much.

110
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,921
When do you open in London?

111
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:44,506
Five days.

112
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,310
Do you mind if I get out of...

113
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,228
No, I'm very sorry, no, of course, do.

114
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:54,229
I'll give you something to ease
the roughness, not that you'll take it.

115
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,983
But if you have got five days,

116
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,528

three of them off.

get me off on the right foot

- Still Scotch.

Well, it doesn't make any difference

because neither one
was worth writing home about.

I should have married you, David.
I really should have.

147

I don't know. l...

Tell you the truth, I don't know.

167
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,946
Maybe it's just that I...

168
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:55,493
Didn't want to be alone on the first night
in a strange town.

169
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,291
You have a mess of friends in town,
you couldn't be alone.

Alone.

171
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,579
That's the most awful word.

172
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,298
And I know what it means.

173
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,545
Because I've been alone since you, David.

174
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,557
You've been married twice.

175
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,478
Well, I was alone then, too.

176
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,816
Tell me, is this when you were knighted?

177
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,734

178
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,273
- OBE.
- OBE.

00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,155
Mmm-hmm. That good, isn't it?

00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,282
Not quite, I'm afraid.

00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,952
It's something.

182
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,489
Yes, it's something.

183
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,054
- Why did you hide him from me?
- I didn't hide him.

184
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,079
I saw you.

185
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,008
All right, I hid him.

186
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,590
Excuse me, Mr. Donne.

187
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,063
Do you require me for anything else?

188
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:56,136
Ah, no, thank you, Miss Plimpton.
I'll see Miss Bowman out.

189
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,217
Good night, Miss Bowman.

190
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,885
Good night.

191
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,599
Is he here?

192
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,438
No, he's at school. He boards.

193
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,150
- I'd love to see him.
- I know.

194
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,737
Oh, David, please!

195
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,237
I didn't come here to ask that.
I swear, I...

196
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,493
I came here to see you. I...

197
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:20,990
I admit that.

198
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,993
It's just that now that I am here, I...

199
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,582
I must ask you. Please.

200
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,380
I'm sorry, Jenny, you can't see him.

201
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,923
Well, why not?

202
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,017
What's the matter with me?

203
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,341
Have I some dread disease
or some kind of...

204
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,675
What are you so afraid of?

205
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,815
- What is it, David? I wanna see him.
- It's impossible.

206
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,193
Well, "impossible" isn't a word that
very many people use with me.

207
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,611
It must come as rather
a surprise to you now, then.

208
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:41,636
I want to see him.

209
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,513
You cannot see him, Jenny.

210
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,478
We made an agreement a long time ago.

211
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:47,813
An agreement that you wanted.

212
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:50,195
Never to see him ever again,
do you remember?

213
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,026
Yes, I remember.

214
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:56,902
It was a long time ago.

215
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,205
It was the only good thing
lever made in my life.

216
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:03,624
Now I can't...

217
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,952
Oh, forget it!

218
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,877
Tell me, does he like school?

219
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,959
I mean, any more than anyone does?

220
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,039
Yes, he...

221
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,050
He likes it very much.

222
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,502
Is he clever?

223
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,550
He's average.

224
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,135
Better at Mozart than maths.

225
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,510
And musical?

226
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,054
A little odd if not.

227
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,597
Yes.

228
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,393
And the rest?

229
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,274
Well, he is...

230
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,157
He's really pretty good.
I think you'd be proud of him.

231
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,159
- Let me see him.
- No.

232
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,111
- Just once.
- And then what?

233
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,284
Nothing. I go.

234
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:46,452
Look, Jenny, to see him now
would make it much harder for you,

235
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,332
for me, for all of us.

236
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,797

00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,423
Well, I think I've taken up
enough of your time, David.

239
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:57,730
And I'd like to get out of here.

240
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,523
- Where's my coat?
- It's outside. I'll call you a cab.

241

- No, thank you, I'd rather walk.
- It won't take a moment.

No, thank you, I'd rather walk.

243
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,265

I'll take care of myself.

It really would mean so much
to you, wouldn't it?

00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,302
To see him again?

257
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,385
Yes.

for anything.

Listen, Matt, you're going to see my show
and then we're gonna have supper together

710
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,221
and then I think I'll bed you down
at the Savoy.

711
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:57,344
And after that we'll get your tape recorder
tomorrow that he promised you

712

and a couple of other things, maybe.

01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:38,105
Nothing much. That won't take long...

1041
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:40,427
Well, you hurry up then, the car's outside.

1042
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:42,009
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

1043
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:48,390
So, now it's Paris, is it?

1044
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:50,858
And then the rest of the tour.
Rome, Athens...

1045
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:52,811
Oh, for God's sake, don't sulk.

1046
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,488
You saw his face,
you saw how sorry he was.

1047
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:56,990
And you know how sorry I am.

1048
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,741
What do you want us both to do, just die?

1049
01:02:58,817 --> 01:03:00,160
I don't want you to do anything.

1050
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:02,195
I just want to get out of here
as soon as possible.

1051
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:03,957
Well, what was so terrible about it anyway?

1052
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:07,455
He came to see the show, we took a trip
up the river and we had a good time.

1053
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:10,037
What's so terrible about that?
We had a wonderful time.

1054
01:03:10,078 --> 01:03:12,723
And you're standing there as if
I'm some kind of criminal or something,

1055
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,044
like I'm Lizzie Borden.

1056
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:16,547
- Oh, for God's sake, Jenny...
- Oh, for God's sake, Jenny!

1057
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:19,046
I stayed out of the way as long
as your wife was around.

1058
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:21,052
And she was good for him.

1059
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:22,924
Well, fine.

1060
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:24,850
But what now?

1061
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:27,391
You with your grave demeanor,

1062
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:30,690
or your Auntie Beth in Canterbury
who's 40 years too late!

1063
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:32,852
What kind of life are you offering him?

1064
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:34,161
What you fail you to realize, Jenny,

1065
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:37,029
is that we have a very good relationship,
Matt and I.

1066
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:38,982
We were doing very well
before you came along,

1067
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:41,193
and we'll do a damn sight better
after you've gone.

1068
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:44,446
Boy, you know where to hit, don't you?

1069
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:47,370
Well, I want to tell you something.

1070
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:50,167
He needs me.

1071
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:51,244
And I want him!

1072
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:53,254
He's not yours to have.

1073
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,833
You gave him back to me a long time ago.

1074
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,644
I need him, I love him,
and I'm going to keep him.

1075
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:00,396
You need him and I want him
and you want him and I...

1076
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:03,219
He's not a bone, my God, he's a child!

1077
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:05,634
He's my son.

1078
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,937
And I'm going to keep him.

1079
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:15,610
There's just one thing
we seem to both have forgotten.

1080
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,234
He's my son, too.

1081
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:22,651
I made him.

1082
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:26,370
Now, where do we go from there?

1083
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:36,539
I packed.

1084
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:40,176
There's some other things
in the bedroom, but...

1085
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:43,888
We'll send for those later, Matt.

1086
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:45,465
Yes.

1087
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:50,395
Can I have the tape recorder?

1088
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:52,480
It was a present.

1089
01:04:58,144 --> 01:04:59,487
Is it true?

1090
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:03,157
Yes.

1091
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:05,906
MATT: Why didn't you tell me?

1092
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:11,074
I... I meant to, uh...

1093
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:14,665
I kept putting it off, I'm afraid.

1094
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:17,455
But...

1095
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,462
Why didn't you tell me?

1096
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:25,930
I made a promise to your father.

1097
01:05:26,673 --> 01:05:28,596
Matt, I think we better be
moving along now.

1098
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:30,014
No.

1099
01:05:30,844 --> 01:05:33,097
No, I don't want to go just yet, Father.

1100
01:05:33,555 --> 01:05:34,602
Not yet.

1101
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:37,851
I'd like to stay here for a bit with you

1102
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:40,695
and get it clearer.

1103
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:42,689
If you have no objections.

1104
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:46,697
No, I have no objections.

1105
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:49,286
Please stay.

1106
01:05:49,988 --> 01:05:54,710
Matt, I've never ordered you to do
anything in your whole life, have I?

1107
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:58,922
But I am asking you now
to come home with me.

1108
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:00,957
Will you?

1109
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:05,841
All right.

1110
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:09,633
Jenny, please.

1111
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:11,384
Yes, Matt.

1112
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,263
I'm going because
my father has asked me to.

1113
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:17,857
Not because I want to.

1114
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:19,730
Do you understand?

1115
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:21,728
Yes.

1116
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:25,068
It's what you must do.

1117
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:27,066
Thank you.

1118
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:31,412
Could I call you then, and... And talk?

1119
01:06:32,864 --> 01:06:34,582
Oh, yes, of course.

1120
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:37,752
Call me tomorrow.

1121
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:39,375
All right?

1122
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:41,126
Yes.

1123
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,335
You won't drop it, will you?

1124
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:48,588
No.

1125
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,093
Don't let him wait alone.
Please go with him.

1126
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:12,495
Anything I can get for you, Jenny?

1127
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:29,422
<i>(SINGING) I'll go my way by myself</i>

1128
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:35,978
<i>This is the end of romance</i>

1129
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:44,437
<i>I'll go my way by myself</i>

1130
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:52,282
<i>Love is only a dance</i>

1131
01:07:55,905 --> 01:08:01,833
<i>I'll try to apply myself</i>

1132
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:08,176
<i>And teach my heart how to sing</i>

1133
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:17,516
<i>I'll go my way by myself</i>

1134
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:25,106
<i>Like a bird on the wind</i>

1135
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:32,986
<i>I'll face the unknown</i>

1136
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:41,703
I'll <i>build</i> a <i>world of my own</i>

1137
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:49,339
<i>No one knows better</i>

1138
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:55,223
<i>Than I, myself</i>

1139
01:08:55,256 --> 01:09:01,013
<i>I'm by myself</i>

1140
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:09,396
<i>AH alone</i>

1141
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:23,248
<i>I'll go my way by myself</i>

1142
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:31,214
<i>Here's how the comedy ends</i>

1143
01:09:33,461 --> 01:09:39,468
<i>I'll have to deny myself</i>

1144
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:47,560
<i>Love and laughter and friends</i>

1145
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:55,784
<i>The great clouds in the sky above</i>

1146
01:09:57,944 --> 01:10:03,951
<i>Have put a blotch on my fun</i>

1147
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:11,880
<i>I'll try to fly high above</i>

1148
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:19,967
<i>For my place in the sun</i>

1149
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:28,267
<i>I'll face the unknown</i>

1150
01:10:30,685 --> 01:10:36,317
I'll <i>build</i> a <i>world of my own</i>

1151
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:44,704
<i>No one knows better than I, myself</i>

1152
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:52,800
<i>No, no one knows better than I, myself</i>

1153
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,426
<i>How I wanted love, and fell</i>

1154
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:02,600
<i>Now I say, "What the hell?"</i>

1155
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:09,024
<i>All of those black days are gone</i>

1156
01:11:10,016 --> 01:11:13,520
<i>'Cause it's solo</i>

1157
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:16,022
<i>AH alone</i>

1158
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:19,450
<i>By myself</i>

1159
01:11:20,485 --> 01:11:24,080
<i>From now on</i>

1160
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:31,746
(APPLAUSE)

1161
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:46,439
- Did you call New York?
- Called New York.

1162
01:11:46,511 --> 01:11:48,559
- And?
- Well, it's a little complicated, honey.

1163
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:50,449
- Well, tell me.
- Can't it wait till after the show?

1164
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:52,100
No, it can't, George. Tell me.

1165
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:54,398
- All right, you've got a case.
- I knew it.

1166
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:55,524
I told you.

1167
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:58,778
Ida, I've got a case.

1168
01:11:58,856 --> 01:12:00,779
Jenny, what you've got is a technicality.

1169
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:04,283
Now, I'm gonna lay it out for you just
the way the lawyers laid it out for me.

1170
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:06,684
The records were searched
and the adoption was legitimate.

1171
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:07,831
JENNY: What'd you say?

1172
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:09,750
I said, the adoption was legitimate.

1173
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:11,244
As far as it went.

1174
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:12,930
But there's such a thing as second papers.

1175
01:12:12,954 --> 01:12:14,139
Now, don't ask me what they are.

1176
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:16,086
They're second papers
and you never signed them.

1177
01:12:16,624 --> 01:12:18,092
JENNY: Well, thank heaven for me.

1178
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,978
Well, that means
if you wanna fight it, you can.

1179
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:22,972
Now, no guarantees.
A whole long megillah in court.

1180
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:24,841
Frankly, darling, it's a long shot.

1181
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:26,926
JENNY: Well, did you tell them to go ahead?

1182
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:29,016
No, I didn't tell them anything just yet.

1183
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:30,938
JENNY; Well, tell them so!

1184
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:42,779
George, will you please call the lawyers?

1185
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:45,824
Jenny.

1186
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:49,373
Jenny, right now, at this moment,
you're on top of a career

1187
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:51,325
you've been building for over 20 years.

1188
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:53,457
And half that time I've been with you.

1189
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:56,126
So, I know a little bit about the subject.

1190
01:12:57,331 --> 01:13:01,507
Jenny, I can't stand by
and watch you destroy it and yourself.

1191
01:13:02,295 --> 01:13:04,898
If you fight this case, you might win.
It's possible, I don't know.

1192
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:06,515
But do you realize what it would mean?

1193
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:08,935
You couldn't be in Rome one week,
Miami the next.

1194
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:12,184
No, you'd have to stay here, in England,
and fight it out in the courts.

1195
01:13:12,263 --> 01:13:14,391
Jenny, the boy's got a home,
he's got a father,

1196
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:15,941
a school, a way of life.

1197
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:19,229
You can't jump into the middle of that
and start making all kinds of waves.

1198
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:22,652
Oh, George, please.

1199
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:23,907
All right.

1200
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:25,919
All right. Suppose, you got him.
What would you do with him?

1201
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:28,196
Trail around the world
with a tutor from day to day?

1202
01:13:28,279 --> 01:13:30,748
Hotel suites, rented oars,
other people's houses.

1203
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:32,718
And they're pretty strict
in England about schools.

1204
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:34,094
You might have to send him to a school

1205
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:36,667
and come and visit him now and then
at vacation time.

1206
01:13:36,704 --> 01:13:37,751
Jenny.

1207
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:40,545
Jenny, you'd be strangers, don't you see?

1208
01:13:41,459 --> 01:13:43,177
- (STAMMERS)
- All right. All right.

1209
01:13:44,045 --> 01:13:45,843
And what would happen to you?

1210
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:48,633
How would you be able to work
with this pull all the time?

1211
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:51,018
I mean, do you know
how to handle a small boy?

1212
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:52,970
It's a full-time job.

1213
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:57,020
Forgive me, dear,
but I don't think you know how to do it.

1214
01:13:57,141 --> 01:13:59,143
This. All this. This is your job.

1215
01:13:59,185 --> 01:14:01,813
You do it better,
better than anybody else in the whole world

1216
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:03,527
because you know it.

1217

Don't force this, Jenny.

1218
01:14:05,483 --> 01:14:06,609

to help me, but...

You... You see, I love him.

1221
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:20,586

No, not a bit.

No, don't put it away.

It's rather fine.

1236
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:42,706
I've spent most of today
wondering how to explain things to you.

1237
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:44,790
You've had some pretty rough things
flung at you,

1238
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:47,131
and now you'd better have the truth.

1239
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,007
It's up to me to give it to you.

1240
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:52,306
- Shall we sit down?
- Yes.

1241
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,473
I don't know how much you heard today,

1242
01:15:56,552 --> 01:16:00,147
but I presume enough to know
that I'm your real father.

1243
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:01,644
And Jenny's your mother.

1244
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,523
Were you and Jenny married once?

1245
01:16:06,437 --> 01:16:08,360
No, Matt, we were never married.

1246
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:13,448
We fell in love
while I was in New York, studying.

1247
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:15,659
I did ask her to marry me.

1248
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:17,373
To come home, to England.

1249
01:16:18,532 --> 01:16:20,159
But I hadn't reckoned with one thing.

1250
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:22,762
That was her career, which meant more
to her than anything else.

1251
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:27,758
I couldn't make her change her mind,
and I had to come back here to work.

1252
01:16:28,876 --> 01:16:30,219
So, I came alone.

1253
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:34,508
- That's pretty clear, isn't it?
- Yes.

1254
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:41,146
And then I met Janet again.

1255
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:45,150
We'd known each other
since we were almost your age.

1256
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:48,609
It was always rather expected
that we'd get married, so we did.

1257
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:53,651
And then I heard
that you were about to be born.

1258
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,957
Jenny did her best to look after you,

1259
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:04,583
but touring the world with a small child
isn't always convenient.

1260
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:09,549
So, Janet and I talked things over

1261
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:11,853
and it was decided that you would
come and live with us as our son.

1262
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:14,721
Our adopted son,
because that was kinder to Janet.

1263
01:17:16,549 --> 01:17:19,393
I don't understand
why you didn't tell me when Janet died.

1264
01:17:20,427 --> 01:17:22,771
I didn't expect you to understand entirely.

1265
01:17:23,222 --> 01:17:25,566
That'll take time. Perhaps a long time.

1266
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:29,562

1270
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:44,243
Well, you've promised to telephone Jenny.

1271
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:47,129
- And I expect you'll be thinking about that.
- Yes.

1272
01:17:47,204 --> 01:17:48,922
And what shall you say to her?

1273
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:51,167
What do you think I should say to her?

1274
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:53,145
That's a decision
you have to make yourself, Matt.

1275
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:55,297
But I can tell you what she'll say to you.

1276
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:57,347
She'll ask you to meet her in Paris.

1277
01:17:57,423 --> 01:17:59,109
And when you get there,
it'll be another place.

1278
01:17:59,133 --> 01:18:00,569
- And then another...
- How do you know?

1279
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:01,890
Because she wants you.

1280
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:03,429
But she just said for a few days.

1281
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:05,268
It doesn't stop there, Matt.

1282
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:07,725
Just because you're angry with Jenny,
why should I be?

1283
01:18:07,808 --> 01:18:10,561
Look, I'm not angry with Jenny.
I'm not angry with her.

1284
01:18:10,644 --> 01:18:13,523
I know her,
and I know what I'm talking about.

1285
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:15,449
She wants you, not for a weekend.

1286
01:18:15,983 --> 01:18:17,075
But you.

1287
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:20,787
She wants you to leave your friends,
your home and your school.

1288
01:18:20,863 --> 01:18:22,240
To start a new way of life.

1289
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:25,952
Matt, I... I know
what fun she's been to be with,

1290
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:28,959
I know how kind she is,
and good and wise, too, sometimes.

1291
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:31,965
And it would be exciting.

1292

you'll fly, you'd catch boats.

And you'd laugh a lot.

1294
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:41,634
I know her, Matt.

1295
01:18:43,928 --> 01:18:44,975
I loved her.

1296
01:18:46,513 --> 01:18:48,140

Jenny gives more love than anyone.

1299
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:55,572
But she takes more love
than anyone can possibly give.

01:18:56,607 --> 01:18:57,859
Can you understand that?

1301
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:00,986
But what if I do go with her?

1302
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:03,072
Well, if it was something
you really wanted to do

1303

Of course I care!

Does it show?

1379
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:08,861
Someone told me.

1380
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:11,360
That was pretty sneaky.

1381
01:25:11,982 --> 01:25:16,032
Oh, there's a young lord
I must warn you about.

1382
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:17,404
- Oh?
- Hmm.

1383
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:20,661
A young Lord George...

1384
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:22,576
Hell, whatever his name was.

1385
01:25:22,659 --> 01:25:25,412
He asked me if he could take me home.

1386
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:27,247
And I said thank you.

1387
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:28,749
And we got into a cab.

1388
01:25:28,832 --> 01:25:32,052
The next thing I knew, it was "all
fall down" and I wound up with this.

1389
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:35,513
He knew where he lived, all right.

1390
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:39,635
But I was out. I was out cold. I was out.

1391
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:41,728
And nobody asked me where I lived.

1392
01:25:41,762 --> 01:25:43,389
Well, how did you get here?

1393
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:46,649
Cab driver named Gerald.

1394
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:49,528
Gerald brought me here.

1395
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:53,115
And they fixed my foot
and they gave me coffee.

1396
01:25:53,523 --> 01:25:57,369
And somebody asked for an autograph
for their cousin Marilyn.

1397
01:25:57,402 --> 01:26:00,121
Oh! I feel awful, David.

1398
01:26:00,864 --> 01:26:03,413
- Have some of this, come on.
- Oh, no more coffee. No.

1399
01:26:03,450 --> 01:26:07,045
I couldn't take any more coffee. If you...
You'd have to feed me through the vein.

1400
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:10,959
I'm full. I'm full to the brim
with the whole goddamn world.

1401
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:13,260
Yes, but now, come on.
Be good, drink this. Come on.

1402
01:26:13,293 --> 01:26:14,840
Have you come to take me home?

1403
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:17,139
No, I've come to take you to the theater.

1404
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:21,593
Oh, no, you haven't.

1405
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:23,029
- I'm not going back there.
- Drink some of this.

1406
01:26:23,053 --> 01:26:26,432
- I'm not going back there ever, ever again.
- Listen, they are waiting.

1407
01:26:26,515 --> 01:26:28,267
I don't care if they're fasting.

1408
01:26:28,308 --> 01:26:31,079
You just give 'em their money back
and tell them to come back next fall.

1409
01:26:31,103 --> 01:26:33,822
- Jenny, it's a sellout.
- I'm always a sellout.

1410
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:35,740
You promised. They're waiting.

1411
01:26:35,774 --> 01:26:39,119
- There's George and Ida and 200,000...
- George and Ida and 200,000, I know that.

1412
01:26:39,152 --> 01:26:41,280
I know. Just let them wait.
To hell with them.

1413
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:44,374
I'm... Can't be spread so thin.

1414
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:46,373
I'm just one person.

1415
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:50,172
I don't wanna be rolled out like a pastry
so everybody'd get a nice, big bite of me.

1416
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:51,540
Mmm-hmm.

1417
01:26:51,623 --> 01:26:53,717
I'm just me. I belong to myself.

1418
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:57,092
I can do whatever I damn well please
with myself,

1419
01:26:57,129 --> 01:26:58,802
and nobody can ask any questions.

1420
01:26:58,839 --> 01:27:00,274
Now, you know that is not true, don't you?

1421
01:27:00,298 --> 01:27:03,268
Well, I'm not gonna do it anymore.
And that's final.

1422
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:08,516
I... It's just not worth all the deaths
that I have to die.

1423
01:27:08,598 --> 01:27:12,148
You have... You have a show to do tonight.
You are going to do it.

1424
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:14,355
And I am going to see that you do.

1425
01:27:15,981 --> 01:27:17,949
You think you can make me sing?

1426
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:19,200
Do you think you can...

1427
01:27:19,276 --> 01:27:21,574
Do you think George can make me sing?
Or Ida?

1428
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:24,372
You can get me there, sure,
but can you make me sing?

1429
01:27:24,448 --> 01:27:26,871
- No, we...
- I sing for myself. I sing when I want to.

1430
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:28,835
Whenever I want to. Just for me.

1431
01:27:28,869 --> 01:27:30,337
- I sing for my own pleasure.
- Yes.

1432
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:31,496
- Yes.
- Whenever I want.

1433
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:33,141
- Do you understand that?
- Yes, I do understand that.

1434
01:27:33,165 --> 01:27:35,042
Just hang onto that, will you?
Hang onto that.

1435
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:39,297
Well, I've hung onto every bit of rubbish
there is to hang onto in life.

1436
01:27:39,463 --> 01:27:41,761
And I've thrown all the good bits away.

1437
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,592
- Now, can you tell me why I do that?
- No.

1438
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:45,153
No, no. I can't tell you why you do that.

1439
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:47,225
But I can tell you this,
you are going to be late.

1440
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:49,560
I don't care.

1441
01:27:54,478 --> 01:27:55,695
Darling,

1442
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:03,195
I don't give a damn who you letdown.

1443
01:28:04,863 --> 01:28:07,116
But you're not gonna let you down.

1444
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:14,373
You haven't called me that for years.

1445
01:28:15,707 --> 01:28:17,960
I haven't been able
to call you that for years.

1446
01:28:18,293 --> 01:28:20,521
Now, come here, look.
Just look at me. Please, look at me.

1447
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:22,513
- Are you listening to me?
- Hmm.

1448
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:26,685
There's something I haven't been able
to say to you in years, too.

1449
01:28:27,761 --> 01:28:29,388
- L...
- David, don't.

1450
01:28:31,598 --> 01:28:33,566
Don't say it.

1451
01:28:34,684 --> 01:28:36,357
Because if you said it now

1452
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:38,981
and if you didn't mean it,

1453
01:28:39,064 --> 01:28:41,738
(SOBBING) I think I'd... I think I'd die.

1454
01:28:43,527 --> 01:28:46,076
- I'll mean it.
- Mmm-mmm.

1455
01:28:48,114 --> 01:28:49,331
I love you.

1456
01:28:49,407 --> 01:28:52,957
(CRYING) Oh! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!

1457
01:28:53,787 --> 01:28:55,915

1460
01:29:03,839 --> 01:29:07,184
He didn't want to go with me.

1461
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:09,102
He didn't want to.

1462
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:13,098
He made all kinds of excuses.

1463
01:29:13,974 --> 01:29:16,102
He didn't want to stay with me.

1464
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:17,606
Darling, I know, I know.

1465
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:21,106
Help me, please.

1466
01:29:21,147 --> 01:29:25,243
(STUTTERING) I want to help you,
but I don't know how.

1467
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:26,319
Now, look...

1468
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:29,953
Come with me now.
Come now, Jenny, please.

1469
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:37,129
David...

1470
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:39,795
You wouldn't cheat me, would you?

1471
01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:42,019
- You wouldn't pretend to me.
- Oh, darling, I wouldn't cheat you.

1472
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:43,312
You wouldn't say you love me, would you?

1473
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:45,690
- No, I wouldn't say I love you if I didn't.
- Then tell me again.

1474
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:48,342
JENNY: Please tell me, again.
Please, once.

1475
01:29:48,425 --> 01:29:50,598
I'll tell you as often as you want me to.

1476
01:29:51,928 --> 01:29:53,555
I've always loved you.

That's where it ends.

1480
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:08,161
We were the right people
that met at the wrong moment.

1481
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:09,909
With all the right ideals.

1482
01:30:10,822 --> 01:30:15,202
We were just too strong-headed
to give up everything for each other.

1483
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:21,924
We just didn't fit.

1484
01:30:22,208 --> 01:30:23,255
We fitted.

1485
01:30:24,169 --> 01:30:25,341
The rest didn't.

1486
01:30:28,465 --> 01:30:31,014
That doesn't make much sense.

1487

Yes.

- Mmm-hmm. I'm all right.

You'll be 45 minutes getting dressed.

You think they're gonna wait for you?

1512

There are 2500 people out there

to you anymore,

for audiences.

They mean a great deal to me.

And if they still do mean something to you,

then I'm gonna find it very difficult
to forgive you.
