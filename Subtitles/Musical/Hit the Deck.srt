- Pretty cute gag about that cake, Bill.
- No gag.

00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,771
- Well, what happened to the cook?
- Sick.

25
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,933
And I have to have a cake baked.
A good one.

26
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,477
I already had one volunteer,
and he didn't work out.

27
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:19,444
Well, what's the deal? Brief us on it.

33

Now, the skipper's
cutting the orders himself.

35
00:03:36,432 --> 00:03:40,960
Today is his birthday,
and he's very sentimental about birthdays.

36
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:44,368
So I figured if I walked in
carrying the cake...

37
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,202
...and you two guys followed me
singing "Happy Birthday"...

38
00:03:47,377 --> 00:03:49,368
- Hey, that's a good idea.
- "Happy Birthday."

- Yeah, if you can call it a cake.

45
00:04:06,262 --> 00:04:08,287
The skipper won't like it
if you get loaded.

46
00:04:08,464 --> 00:04:11,490
So what'll he do, send me home?

47

(APPLAUSE)

201
00:15:00,716 --> 00:15:02,081
Ginger, baby.

202
00:15:02,251 --> 00:15:04,151
Well, well.
Look what the tide washed up.

203
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,619
- Hey, what kind of talk is that?
- Aw, go back to your old boat.

204
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,951
(BAND PLAYING)

205
00:15:12,628 --> 00:15:14,391
Ginger.

206
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:23,062
What's the matter, honey?
I'm gone for almost a year.

207
00:15:23,238 --> 00:15:25,672
I break my neck to see you.
You don't even say hello.

208
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:29,004
Hello. And now
that that's over, goodbye.

209
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,874
But I brought you a present.
Aren't you even gonna open it?

210
00:15:32,047 --> 00:15:33,480
I'm not opening a gift shop.

211
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:36,948
But it's a genuine baby turtle
from the south seas.

212
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:39,610
Great. That's just what I needed.

213
00:15:39,788 --> 00:15:41,415
First, a parrot, now a turtle.

214
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,388
Always another mouth to feed.
I don't want him.

215
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,996
Oh, but he's only a baby.
What'll I do with him?

216
00:15:48,163 --> 00:15:49,755
You know what you can do with him?

217
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:52,799
Throw him in the bay, head him south,
and let him swim home.

218
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:55,232
And you can go with him.

219
00:15:55,938 --> 00:15:58,270
Oh, I don't understand.

220
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,841
What are you mad about?
What did I do?

221
00:16:02,011 --> 00:16:06,107
Nothing. For six years, nothing.

222
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:10,411
You know, when a girl gets engaged,
sooner or later, she'd like to get married.

223
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:13,282
Oh, honey, don't start that all over again.

224
00:16:13,455 --> 00:16:15,650
I wanna get married too,
but being in the Navy...

225
00:16:15,824 --> 00:16:17,849
If it's so bad,
why do you keep reenlisting?

226
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:21,519
- Well, it's my job. It's what I do.
- It's your alibi.

227
00:16:21,697 --> 00:16:24,962
For six years, you've been using it
as an excuse, and I'm tired of it.

228
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:27,694
I wanna get married and settle down
like everybody else.

229
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:31,306
- I promise as soon as this cruise is over...
- Yeah, well, don't rush.

230
00:16:31,473 --> 00:16:33,668
I found somebody else.

231
00:16:33,842 --> 00:16:35,241
You found somebo...?

232
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,471
Oh, no. You can't do that to me.

233
00:16:38,647 --> 00:16:42,777
You're my girl. I'd die for you.
You know that.

234
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:46,148
Yeah, well, that's the difference
between you and Herman.

235
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:48,380
Herman wants to marry me
and take care of me.

236
00:16:48,557 --> 00:16:51,993
But you? You'd sooner drop dead.

237
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:54,989
Okay, drop dead.

238
00:17:04,173 --> 00:17:06,641
- Mom.
- Rico. Rico.

239
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:09,107
I'm so glad to see you. Oh!

240
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,644
- You look taller and handsome.
- You look beautiful.

241
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:13,076
- How's my girl?
- Fine, fine.

242
00:17:13,248 --> 00:17:15,512
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming home today?

243
00:17:15,684 --> 00:17:19,552
- I thought you might like a surprise.
- Oh, a surprise. It certainly is, believe me.

244
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:23,021
- Mr. Peroni is visiting.
- Peroni? Who's he?

245
00:17:23,192 --> 00:17:26,355
Well, he bought the flower shop
on the corner about six months ago.

246
00:17:26,528 --> 00:17:30,487
He's a very lovely man,
and we're keeping company.

247
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,066
Great, best news I ever heard.
I'd like to meet him.

248
00:17:33,235 --> 00:17:36,170
Of course, but it might be a surprise
to him too.

249
00:17:36,338 --> 00:17:39,068
- Why? Didn't you tell him about me?
- Certainly, I did.

250
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:42,267
But he doesn't think
I have such a grown-up son.

251
00:17:42,444 --> 00:17:45,572
And I know it's silly, but if he sees
how grown-up you are...

252
00:17:45,748 --> 00:17:47,340
...he might think I'm an old lady.

253
00:17:47,516 --> 00:17:49,643
Oh, Mom.

254
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,286
PERONl:
What's keeping you so long...?

255
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:55,782
What's going on here?

256
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:59,189
Come inside, Rico, and meet Mr. Peroni.

257
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:08,533
Mr. Peroni, I want you to meet a young man
I'm very proud of:

258
00:18:08,704 --> 00:18:10,467
My son, Rico.

259
00:18:10,639 --> 00:18:12,573
Your son?

260
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:15,766
PERONl:
Hmph.

261
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,779
- Hmph. Son.
- I'm very happy to know you, Mr. Peroni.

262
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,612
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to barge in...
- That's all right.

263
00:18:24,787 --> 00:18:26,084
I was going to leave anyway.

264
00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:28,519
Oh, not at all.
Look, I have to meet some friends.

265
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,126
You stay right here. I'm sure you
and Mom have a lot to talk about.

266
00:18:32,294 --> 00:18:33,693
I'll be back later.

267
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:37,093
And I'm looking forward
to seeing you again too, Pop.

268
00:18:37,933 --> 00:18:40,060
I mean, Mr. Peroni.

269
00:18:41,804 --> 00:18:44,272
Well, for 9 years old,
he's pretty grown-up.

270
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:48,933
- You know boys. They grow up overnight.
- Must have been a long night.

271
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:53,013
To a mother, no matter how big they are,
they're always babies.

272
00:18:53,182 --> 00:18:55,173
You're not angry
just because I exaggerate...

273
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:59,480
Well, I don't know. I don't know
whether I'm angry, but I'm upset.

274
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:00,883
A grown-up son.

275
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,115
You didn't think I was a bobbysoxer,
did you?

276
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:05,055
But I did not bargain for that much.

277
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,889
I'm glad to hear it,
because with most men...

278
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,327
...the older they get,
the younger they want them.

279
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:11,966
Oh, so I'm an old man now?

280
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:14,898
Well, let me tell you something.
I am not yet 50.

281
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,630
- And I'm not 45.
- With a man, it's much different.

282
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:19,740
Not with the insurance companies.

283
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,877
They say that most women
outlive their husbands.

284
00:19:23,045 --> 00:19:26,014
Now she's got me dead already.
That's enough.

285
00:19:26,181 --> 00:19:27,205
Where are you going?

286
00:19:27,382 --> 00:19:31,045
I have a very stylish wedding.
I have to get the flowers ready.

287
00:19:32,554 --> 00:19:35,455
And I'm not too old to work all night.

288
00:20:00,816 --> 00:20:02,283
Hello, Father.

289
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:06,012
- Daniel, glad to see you.
- Thank you, sir. You look well, sir.

290
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:09,385
I'm just leaving for San Diego,
but I'll be back in a couple of days.

291
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:10,650
We can have a talk then.

292
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:12,851
I won't be here, sir. I only have a 48.

293
00:20:13,028 --> 00:20:16,987
Oh, that's too bad,
but it can't be helped. Uh...

294
00:20:17,165 --> 00:20:19,258
Tell me, why did you come in
the back way?

295
00:20:19,434 --> 00:20:22,995
- Something wrong with the front door?
- I didn't want to tangle with your men.

296
00:20:23,171 --> 00:20:26,368
You know how they are,
always curious about an admiral's family.

297
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,203
- Still keeping it dark, eh?
- Yes, sir.

298
00:20:29,378 --> 00:20:32,575
What's the matter with you?
Are you ashamed of me?

299
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:36,616
In my time, I was very proud of the fact
that my father was an admiral.

300
00:20:36,785 --> 00:20:38,980
My father felt the same way
about his father.

301
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,215
You're not gonna keep me dark
when you get to Annapolis.

302
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:46,054
It's different there, sir. In Annapolis,
everyone has brass in his ancestry.

303
00:20:46,228 --> 00:20:48,822
I'm not an ancestor yet.
I'm still in active service.

304
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:52,455
- You don't understand, sir.
- What is there to understand?

305
00:20:52,634 --> 00:20:55,296
I like my buddies,
and we get fun out of beefing together.

306
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,495
- Ohh.
- But, well, if they knew about you...

307
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,369
...they'd think I was asking
for special privileges.

308
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:02,635
Then I'd have no more friends
and no more fun.

309
00:21:02,811 --> 00:21:04,039
Fun, fun.

310
00:21:04,212 --> 00:21:07,306
That's all you younger generation
think about today, fun.

311
00:21:07,482 --> 00:21:09,143
Susan.

312
00:21:09,551 --> 00:21:11,883
- Susan, do you hear me?
SUSAN: Yes.

313
00:21:12,054 --> 00:21:14,750
Here's your brother, Daniel. He's home.

314
00:21:14,923 --> 00:21:18,450
Thank you, Father. Hello, brother Dan.

315
00:21:18,627 --> 00:21:21,562
Well, it's certainly nice
to have the family all together again.

316
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,322
Goodbye.

317
00:21:24,566 --> 00:21:26,431
SUSAN:
Bye, Dad.

318
00:21:28,337 --> 00:21:31,795
(IMITATING SMITH)
Susan, your brother Daniel's home.

319
00:21:31,974 --> 00:21:32,963
Hi, brother Dan.

320
00:21:33,141 --> 00:21:34,438
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
Hi, Susie.

321
00:21:34,609 --> 00:21:37,203
- Oh, it's so good to have you back.
- Let me take a look at you.

322
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,678
SUSAN: Hmm.
- Oh, you look great.

323
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:42,646
Oh, you.

324
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:45,252
Father hasn't changed a bit.
Funny, isn't it?

325
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,389
Well, it might be funny to you,
but I have to live with him.

326
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:52,550
I'm getting a little bit tired of being treated
like a character in a Victorian novel.

327
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,822
Sometimes it drives me crazy.
I can't do anything girls do...

328
00:21:55,998 --> 00:21:58,489
...because he doesn't approve

- Admiral, we were looking...
- We made a mistake.

I'm Daniel Smith. What do you want?

We were told
that this Daniel Smith was a sailor, sir.

under arrest, admiral.

Well, you beat up a civilian

You wrecked his apartment.

Answer my question.

1039
01:11:29,925 --> 01:11:36,421
Well, it seems that you and him
were having a fight over a broad.

I mean, a dame.

- Don't explain.

...we had the feeling
that something was wrong.

Oh, did you? How very shrewd.

1047
01:11:55,184 --> 01:11:57,584
You ought to be in Naval Intelligence.

Yeah, quite right.

Uh, I'm sorry I lost my temper.

1053
01:12:13,636 --> 01:12:18,073
I should've realized that there must be
more than one Daniel Smith in the Navy.

01:12:59,348 --> 01:13:01,839
Not a thing.
Why should anything be wrong?

01:13:02,017 --> 01:13:05,953
- No reason. Just thought I'd ask.
- You don't know where he went, do you?

1067
01:13:06,121 --> 01:13:08,385
Probably went with some of the boys
from the ship.

you were saying about Daniel?

you can get it off his record?

1161

...you don't know what happens
when an old man like Mr. Peroni...

1162
01:18:21,236 --> 01:18:23,431
...goes after a woman
as lovely as your mother.

They lose their heads.

1164

- How much?
- Six dollars.

1165
01:18:30,445 --> 01:18:32,413
For you, is $24.

1166

- I don't want respect. You're my girl.

...and they have three white stripes
on the collars of their jumpers.

Well, shouldn't your brother
and his friends be with you for protection?

with anyone, be angry with me.

I am angry with you.

Well, suppose they apologized
and paid for the damages?

1355

All they want is a chance
to make up for what they did.

1356
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:42,254
- They do?
- Mm-hm. I just spoke to them.

On one condition,
that they make the apology in person, here.

I'd be happy to talk to him for you.

DANNY, BILL & RICO:
Yes, sir.

1433
01:39:43,217 --> 01:39:47,278
You, in particular,
should have a sense of responsibility.

1434
01:39:47,454 --> 01:39:50,514
Obviously, it was a mistake
to promote you to your present rate...

Very noble. Everybody bails everybody out.

You've all behaved like idiots.

don't tell admirals anything.

- lf you'll just stop hollering, I'll listen.

1479
01:42:10,798 --> 01:42:12,459
Now, that's a good boy.

1480
01:42:19,406 --> 01:42:21,738
Just where do you think
you're going, young lady?

1481
01:42:21,909 --> 01:42:23,968
I was on the way to the base
to see you, Dad.

1482
01:42:24,144 --> 01:42:27,409
I want to talk about the trouble
Danny and his friends are in.

1483
01:42:27,581 --> 01:42:30,015
- I'm the girl the fight was about.
- Yes.

1484
01:42:30,184 --> 01:42:32,243
And it makes a pretty picture, doesn't it?

1485
01:42:32,419 --> 01:42:35,718
A girl like you, at your age,
up in a man's apartment. I...

1486
01:42:35,889 --> 01:42:39,757
Well, I'm not a child anymore, you know.
You don't wanna admit it, but I've grown.

1487
01:42:39,927 --> 01:42:45,092
Then I don't see why you didn't have sense
enough to keep out of this mess with Craig.

1488
01:42:45,265 --> 01:42:48,792
There isn't any mess,
but not at least the way you mean it.

1489
01:42:48,969 --> 01:42:51,870
- Why do you believe the worst about me?
- What else can I think?

1490
01:42:52,039 --> 01:42:55,475
That I'm your daughter, and wouldn't stand
for anything cheap and shabby.

1491
01:42:55,642 --> 01:42:57,940
Then why did Daniel have to save you?

1492
01:42:58,112 --> 01:43:00,774
Because he's just like you,
jumping to conclusions.

1493
01:43:00,948 --> 01:43:04,111
He didn't have to save me.
Nobody had to save me.

1494
01:43:04,284 --> 01:43:08,152
Once I found out what Craig was really like,
I'd have enough sense to walk away.

1495
01:43:08,322 --> 01:43:12,156
I don't know why you couldn't have come
to me and talked about this before.

1496
01:43:12,326 --> 01:43:15,887
Would you have listened,
or would you have just issued a command?

1497
01:43:21,769 --> 01:43:23,634
I'm sorry.

1498
01:43:24,271 --> 01:43:29,470
I didn't realize that having an admiral
for a father might have some disadvantages.

1499
01:43:31,211 --> 01:43:33,805
Oh, it has its advantages too.

1500
01:43:33,981 --> 01:43:36,916
- Oh, you've gotta help them, Dad.
- I can't do a thing.

1501
01:43:37,084 --> 01:43:41,248
The fact that you were just naive,
and Daniel's motives were the best...

1502
01:43:41,422 --> 01:43:43,390
...doesn't alter what he did.

1503
01:43:43,557 --> 01:43:45,752
They're such wonderful fellows.
Talk to them.

1504
01:43:45,926 --> 01:43:48,326
I have talked to them.

1505
01:43:49,730 --> 01:43:52,961
- Did you like Danny's friends?
- Of course I liked them.

1506
01:43:53,133 --> 01:43:56,193
- And Rico? Did you like him?
- Uh...

1507
01:43:56,370 --> 01:43:59,430
You mean Ferrari? Yes.

1508
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:04,309
Oh, he's the fellow that told me
he was going to marry you.

1509
01:44:05,079 --> 01:44:06,842
- He did?
- Yeah.

1510
01:44:07,014 --> 01:44:10,177
Of course,
he didn't know that I was your father.

1511
01:44:13,821 --> 01:44:16,722
Just what are you beaming about?

1512
01:44:18,258 --> 01:44:20,624
I had exactly the same idea.

1513
01:44:20,794 --> 01:44:22,557
Oh, you did?

1514
01:44:22,729 --> 01:44:27,530
Well, let me tell you something, young lady.
Nobody in this family marries a sailor.

1515
01:44:27,701 --> 01:44:31,569
Excuse me, sir. Lieutenant Jackson's
downstairs and wants to see you.

1516
01:44:31,738 --> 01:44:35,367
- Tell him I'm busy.
- But he insists, sir. It's very important.

1517
01:44:35,542 --> 01:44:40,673
He insists?
Has the whole Navy gone mad?

1518
01:44:42,116 --> 01:44:44,311
And don't you dare leave this house,
young lady.

1519
01:44:44,485 --> 01:44:48,046
I have enough worries about your brother
without having you dash off to get married.

1520
01:44:48,222 --> 01:44:49,382
(SUSAN CHUCKLES)

1521
01:44:49,556 --> 01:44:51,751
What's this about getting married?

1522
01:44:51,925 --> 01:44:53,586
Soon as he asks me.

1523
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:56,320
- And who is he?
- Oh, you'll meet him, Jenny.

1524
01:44:56,497 --> 01:45:00,160
When things settle down, I'm going
to have Rico and his mother over for dinner.

1525
01:45:00,334 --> 01:45:02,097
Well, that sounds more like it.

1526
01:45:02,269 --> 01:45:04,669
Just what's going on, Mr. Jackson?
In all my years...

1527
01:45:04,838 --> 01:45:08,501
Excuse me, sir, but there's a gentleman here
that wants to talk to you.

1528
01:45:09,743 --> 01:45:12,735
- This is Mr. Wendell Craig, sir.
- How do you do?

1529
01:45:12,913 --> 01:45:15,711
He wanted to talk to you.
Isn't that right, Mr. Craig?

1530
01:45:15,883 --> 01:45:16,907
Yes, indeed.

1531
01:45:17,084 --> 01:45:19,780
Admiral, you don't mind
if I keep these glasses on, do you?

1532
01:45:19,953 --> 01:45:21,784
A little eye strain.

1533
01:45:21,955 --> 01:45:23,547
- Well?
- Go ahead, Mr. Craig.

1534
01:45:23,724 --> 01:45:25,589
The admiral is a busy man.

1535
01:45:25,759 --> 01:45:30,423
Yes. Well, admiral,
it seems as if I made a little mistake.

1536
01:45:30,898 --> 01:45:32,798
You know how things are.

1537
01:45:32,966 --> 01:45:36,766
You get a little excited, you think
you see things that aren't really there.

1538
01:45:36,937 --> 01:45:39,462
Just what wasn't where, Mr. Craig?

1539
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:43,269
Well, in the first place,
take that business in my hotel room.

1540
01:45:43,443 --> 01:45:47,675
Now that I come to think about it,
it wasn't even in my hotel room.

1541
01:45:47,848 --> 01:45:49,577
And about that girl...

1542
01:45:49,750 --> 01:45:51,479
You don't think
I'm the kind of man...

1543
01:45:51,652 --> 01:45:54,917
...that'd have a girl up
to my hotel room, do you? Ha-ha-ha.

1544
01:45:55,689 --> 01:46:00,251
That is, if it was in my hotel room,
which, of course, it wasn't.

1545
01:46:00,427 --> 01:46:04,830
- See what I mean?
- Vaguely. Very vaguely.

1546
01:46:04,998 --> 01:46:07,296
Mr. Craig isn't quite finished yet,
admiral.

1547
01:46:07,467 --> 01:46:09,298
- Oh?
- Are you, Mr. Craig?

1548
01:46:09,469 --> 01:46:11,403
Oh! Oh, no, of course not.

1549
01:46:11,572 --> 01:46:13,540
About those three sailors...

1550
01:46:13,707 --> 01:46:16,107
You see, admiral,
this play that I'm appearing in...

1551
01:46:16,276 --> 01:46:19,837
...is so full of sailors,
I'm beginning to think everyone's a sailor.

1552
01:46:20,013 --> 01:46:23,847
Actually, those three sailors
were three soldiers.

1553
01:46:24,017 --> 01:46:28,420
So you see, if nothing happened,
there's no point in filing charges.

1554
01:46:28,589 --> 01:46:31,649
Uh, you mean you wish
to withdraw the charges?

1555
01:46:31,825 --> 01:46:35,386
Oh, absolutely. Yes, indeed. Definitely.
Without a doubt.

1556
01:46:35,562 --> 01:46:38,929
Why, I don't wanna make any trouble
for the Navy.

1557
01:46:39,099 --> 01:46:42,466
The, uh, Navy appreciates
your attitude, Mr. Craig.

1558
01:46:42,636 --> 01:46:45,571
Mr. Craig wants to get to the base
to withdraw the charge, sir.

1559
01:46:45,739 --> 01:46:50,267
Yes, I do, and the sooner the better.
Well, good day, sir.

1560
01:46:50,444 --> 01:46:53,379
I'll drive you over, Mr. Craig.
I wouldn't want you to get lost.

1561
01:46:53,547 --> 01:46:55,742
- With the admiral's permission, sir.
- Of course.

1562
01:46:55,916 --> 01:46:58,714
We certainly wouldn't want
Mr. Craig to get lost.

1563
01:46:59,753 --> 01:47:03,086
- Uh, Mr. Jackson?
- Yes, sir.

1564
01:47:04,224 --> 01:47:07,751
What caused this sudden change?
There were no threats, no violence, huh?

1565
01:47:07,928 --> 01:47:11,159
Oh, no, sir. I just called on Mr. Craig
to discuss the wedding.

1566
01:47:11,331 --> 01:47:13,128
Wedding? What wedding?

1567
01:47:13,300 --> 01:47:14,961
After what happened, sir,
I thought...

1568
01:47:15,135 --> 01:47:19,037
But nothing happened. I've spoken
to Susan. Absolutely nothing happened.

1569
01:47:19,206 --> 01:47:22,403
Of course. But you know how
the newspapers would write up this story.

1570
01:47:22,576 --> 01:47:24,703
It'd be better if Susan and Craig
were married.

1571
01:47:24,878 --> 01:47:28,177
Married. I don't want Susan
marrying that Craig.

1572
01:47:28,348 --> 01:47:31,613
Mr. Craig didn't think his wife
would like it, either, sir.

1573
01:47:36,890 --> 01:47:39,222
Oh, Mr. Jackson?

1574
01:47:39,393 --> 01:47:41,020
Yes, sir?

1575
01:47:41,728 --> 01:47:44,788
Thank you very much.

1576
01:47:45,465 --> 01:47:47,262
Yes, sir.
