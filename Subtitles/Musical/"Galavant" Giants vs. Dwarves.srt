misplaced your toothbrush?

[Laughs] Zinger! No.

No, you know how today we're heading
into the land of the Giants

00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,454
to offer them the Jewel of Valencia

10
00:00:15,455 --> 00:00:17,489
in exchange for joining our
quest to save Princess Isabella?

11
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,691
Yes, we discussed it last night
in great detail.

There's no need for your clunky exposition.

13

Well, I have managed to trade the jewel

14
00:00:24,364 --> 00:00:26,065
for something even better than an army.

15
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:27,966

a jewel, I have no army,

29
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,195

chance of rescuing Isabella.
