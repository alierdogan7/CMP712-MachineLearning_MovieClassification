1
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,959
As around 20,000 people
took part in a protest against...

2
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,759
Meanwhile,
hundreds of anti-capitalist protestors...

3
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,719
REPORTER 1 : Society continues to generate
waste and squander resources.

4
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,239
REPORTER 2: This is a global issue.

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,639
REPORTER 3: John, what's your view
on the oil market's reaction?

6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,479
l mean, earlier today, we were...

7
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,439
Hundreds of anti-war activists...

00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,919
REPORTER 4:
...Spain and Greece and right across Europe...

9
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,719
...resorted to using gas, stun grenades
and rubber bullets

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,279
to disperse the angry crowd.

11
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,559
MALE PROTESTOR: Hey, stop filming!
The police can use it!

12
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,999
Stay back! Stay back!

13
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,799
REPORTER 5: But the tough economy
is pushing people to the brink.

14
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,519
The question remains, are there...

15
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,439
# My mind is clearer now

16
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,879
# At last, all too well

17
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,959
# l can see

18
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,079
# Where we all soon will be

19
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,199
# lf you strip away

20
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,199
# The myth from the man

21
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,119
# You will see

22
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,599
# Where we all soon will be

23
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,799
# Jesus!

24
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,839
# You've started to believe
the things they say of you

25
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,679
# You really do believe
this talk of God is true

26
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,679
# And all the good you've done
will soon get swept away

27
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,399
# You've begun to matter more

28
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:09,359
# Than the things you say

29
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,479
# Listen, Jesus
l don't like what l see

30
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,759
# All l ask is that you listen to me

31
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,839
# And remember

32
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,719
# l've been your right-hand man all along

33
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,719
# You have set them all on fire

34
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,959
# They think they've found the new Messiah

35
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,399
# And they'll hurt you
when they find they're wrong

36
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,999
# l remember when this whole thing began

37
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,239
# No talk of God then
We called you a man

38
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,919
# And believe me

39
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,879
# My admiration for you hasn't died

40
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,399
# But every word you say today

41
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,039
# Just gets twisted 'round some other way

42
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,319
# And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied

43
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,199
# Nazareth, your famous son
should have stayed a great unknown

44
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,079
# Like his father carving wood
he'd have made good

45
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,159
# Tables, chairs and oaken chests
would have suited Jesus best

46
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,119
# He'd have caused nobody harm
No one alarm

47
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,919
# Listen, Jesus
Do you care for your race?

48
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,919
# Can't you see
we must keep in our place?

49
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,759
# We are occupied

# l am frightened by the crowd

52
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,239
# For we are getting much too loud

53
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,599
# They will crush us if we go too far

54
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,959
# lf we go too far

# Please remember that l want us to live

57
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,319
# But it's sad to see our chances

58
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,359
# Weakening with every hour

59
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,679

# Don't let me stop

1095
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:59,079
# Your great self-destruction

1096
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,559
# Die if you want to

# Every time l look at you, l don't understand

1103
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:09,239
# Why you let the things you did
get so out of hand

1104
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:12,999
# You'd have managed better
if you'd had it planned

1105
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:16,959
# Why'd you choose such
a backwards time and such a strange land?

1106
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:20,959
# lf you'd come today
you would have reached a whole nation

1107
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:24,119

# Who do you think besides yourself's

1122

# Buddha, was he where it's at?
ls he where you are?

1123
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:34,919
# Could Muhammad move a mountain,
baby, or did he just have good P.R.?

1124
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:38,119
# Did you mean to die like that?
Was that a mistake

1125
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:42,479
# Or did you know that your messy death
would be a record breaker?

1126

# Only wanna, only wanna, only wanna know

1140
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,479
God, forgive them.

1141
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,759
They don't know what they're doing.

1142
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:30,719
Where is my mother?

1143
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:41,919
My God.

1144
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:47,279
My God, why have you forsaken me?

1145
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:59,199
l'm thirsty, l'm thirsty.

1146
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:36,279
lt is finished.

1147
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:45,479
Father,

1148
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:46,919
into your hands

1149
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:48,799
l commend

1150
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:50,079
my spirit.

1151
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:53,439
-Thank you.
-Thanks again.

1152
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:55,919
Oh, my gosh.

1153
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:07,039
l just don't know really what to say...

1154
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:09,159
Thank you to everybody.

1155
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:12,999
l mean, what an extraordinary thing for me
to see this brought back,

1156
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:16,679
to where l'd hoped it would always be,
in a rock and roll arena.

1157
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:21,839
And with this fabulous, fabulous cast.

1158
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:25,919
One of the problems about being
in a rock venue is, um,

1159
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,039
Tim will tell you, and Mel will tell you,
is that...

1160
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:31,959
What happens is that about this time of night

1161
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:35,999
the set gets moved, so we could be here...

1162
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:38,999
And if l talked for hours
and l said thank you to everybody,

1163
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:42,959
bits and pieces of the scenery would start
to be removed from underneath me,

1164
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:44,519
so, um... And all of us.

1165
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:48,279
So l'm gonna keep it very, very simple
and l'd like to say

1166
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:50,359
thank you to our fantastic cast.

1167
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:57,759
And Laurence Connor,
who directed the show so brilliantly.

1168
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:02,919
And our wonderful live rock band.

1169
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,439
We are live, remember that.

1170
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,599
And just before they clear the set away...

1171
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:10,519
This may sound very, very strange.

1172
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:14,159
l would like to dedicate this performance
to one person

1173
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:17,119
who was with me when Superstar was written.

1174
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:19,839
Her name was Sarah, and l'd like to say,

1175
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:22,919
if you're in the audience, Sarah,
thank you for coming.

1176
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:25,479
Thank you, all of you.
