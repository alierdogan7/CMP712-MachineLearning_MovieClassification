1
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:08,681
Bahadur Singh, you appear
very happy today!

2
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:13,756
You see, Boney, I'm among those
who are aIways happy.

3
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,457
I just don't know
what grief means.

4
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:21,191
Yes, of course. How wouId you know?
You dabbIe in Iakhs of rupees.

5
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:24,998
After all, you win Iakhs of rupees
in gambllng and horse races.

6
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:30,767
If I win Iakhs of rupees,
I even Iose in Iakhs.

7
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:35,946
For instance, I've Iost
3 Iakh rupees today itseIf.

8
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,247
But no probIem, no tension.

9
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,218
I'll go to the bank, withdraw money,
and settIe the dues. That's all.

10
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:07,106
You must be deallng with smuggIers
and dangerous peopIe in this...

11
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,247
...gambllng business
of yours, don't you?

12
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:12,973
- I do.
- Aren't you scared of such peopIe?

13
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:16,747
Why be scared?
In my llne of work...

14
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:23,425
...one brandishes knives and
revoIvers at every opportunity.

15
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,330
Now I find such things llke toys.

16
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:30,592
You are truIy a brave person.

17
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,031
You're the first person
who has recognised what I am.

18
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,537
No, no. Nothing of the sort.

19
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,279
Mr. Boney, I've arrived
at my bank.

20
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,115
- Keep in touch.
- Sure.

21
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,009
PIease get my cheque cIeared.

22
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,184
Here you are!

23
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,481
What're you doing?

24
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:10,750
You want the money, don't you?
Take the money. But don't shoot me.

25
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,728
PIease don't do this.

26
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:42,182
I've been pIundered, Bahadur Singh.
You've made me Iose money.

27
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:49,518
Give me 500 rupees now.
You've Iost the bet.

28
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,526
What did you say?
He has Iost a bet?

29
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:54,027
He's my friend Raj.

30
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:58,699
Since many years, I had been
hearing that you're a brave man...

31
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,873
...and that nobody
can scare you.

32
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,698
So I pIaced a bet with
him about your bravery.

33
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:06,537
And after hearing your boastfuI
taIks, I was convinced that...

34
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,403
...you are llke a bomb.

35
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:12,376
But you fizzIed out llke a tiny
firecracker. And I Iost the bet.

36
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,883
Do peopIe have to pIace bets on me?
Do I Iook llke a racing horse?

37
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:20,320
You've been inconvenienced because
of us. PIease pardon us.

38
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:26,059
Do you see how profuseIy
I am sweating?

39
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:31,463
You were chasing me as if I were
a stray dog on the streets.

40
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,336
Thankfully, I am not a
weak-hearted person.

41
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,234
Otherwise I wouId've been dead by
now. I'm stllI trembllng.

42
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:41,444
- See for yourseIf.
- Give me 500 rupees, pIease.

43
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:47,745
Why shouId I give you 500 rupees?
You pIaced the bet. You pay the sum.

44
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,486
I don't even know whether my
car wllI be there or not.

45
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,084
Listen, Bahadur Singh...

46
00:09:55,962 --> 00:10:00,524
Where are you going?
Pay me the money. Oome on!

47
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:05,102
Everytime I pIace a bet with you
thinking that I wllI win.

48
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:04,927
Take it. Now you have
to pay me 200 rupees.

49
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:06,762
And I Iose everytime.

50
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:11,976
Really, you are the greatest pIayer
in the fieId of bets. Take the money.

51
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,964
This time I was fully confident
that I'll win the bet.

52
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,135
But the way you fooIed
that constabIe...

53
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,710
...it is proved that nobody
can win a bet with you.

54
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:51,212
You had pIaced a bet for 250 rupees.
But this is onIy 100 rupees.

55
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:54,814
I wllI give the baIance
amount tomorrow. I swear.

56
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:56,645
- You won't change.
- I wllI pay you the baIance.

57
00:10:56,856 --> 00:13:38,648
Raj, I don't have any money even
for food. Give me 50 rupees.

58
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,893
200 rupees?
How come?

59
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,801
Brother?

60
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,336
What happened?

61
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,447
Why did you Iock them up?
What have they done?

62
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,324
I've advised them severaI times not
to pIace bets and commit pranks.

63
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:37,487
But they refuse to llsten. They
shouId be punished for their deeds.

64
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,028
Don't you have any
sense of shame, Raj?

65
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,034
You are the younger brother of a
pollce officer, and you're...

66
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:46,261
...in a Iock-up. Don't you care
for your brother's reputation?

67
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,362
Sister-in-Iaw...actually,
we both...

68
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:52,769
Just llsten quietIy
to whatever I say.

69
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,280
You are grown-up, yet
you behave llke kids.

70
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,041
Did you hear anything, sir?

71
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,217
- I did.
- You didn't hear a thing.

72
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,052
- Go and do your work.
- But, sir...

73
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,392
- What did I ask you to do?
- To do my work.

74
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,399
Oome on, ask your brother
for forgiveness.

75
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:19,794
Sorry, brother.

76
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,735
PIease forgive us.

77
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,911
We wllI never commit
such a deed again.

78
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,911
- OonstabIe, reIease them.
- But, sir...

79
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,082
ReIease them!

80
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:42,927
Thank you, brother.

81
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:50,258
Return soon in the evening.
I'll prepare sweetmeats for you.

82
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:53,937
Let's go.

83
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:55,969
HoId on.

84
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:07,948
I couId understand the drama that
the three of you were enacting.

85
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:13,784
This is the Iast warning.

86
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:17,791
Your college is reopening from
tomorrow. Thereafter, onIy studies...

87
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,961
And you had better hear this.

88
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:29,140
I'll return home earIy this evening.
Keep the sweetmeats ready for me.

89
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:32,671
- What shouId you keep ready?
- Sweetmeats.

90
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:36,140
You may go.
You're spolling the boys.

91
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,319
- What's your resuIt?
- I've falled.

92
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,655
OongratuIations.

93
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:59,327
- How were your holldays?
- Very enjoyabIe.

94
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,170
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong?

95
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,001
How come you have become so sllm?

96
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:09,807
I've grown sllm, haven't I?
You see, I'm on a diet these days.

97
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:13,507
- I can see that.
- Go ahead. You too shouId eat.

98
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,515
Don't you dare touch it.

99
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:20,084
Why scoId him? Let him eat too.
Go ahead. Eat.

100
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,033
Bring a soft drink, pIease.

101
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:32,569
Hey!

102
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,930
This is a girI's hand.

103
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,342
Tell me who this girI is.

104
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:43,743
- This girI...is Madhuri!
- No, you are wrong!

105
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:47,544
Yes...it's Shllpa!

106
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,378
She's not Shllpa.
She's Sh...

107
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,057
Don't you interrupt, fatso!
Oome on. Tell her name!

108
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,284
Ah, yes! She's Sharmlla!

109
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,053
You?

110
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:02,564
Oome...be seated.

111
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:11,068
If I hadn't removed my hand you wouId
have named another 25 girIs.

112
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:16,681
I knew all aIong that it was you.
I was onIy teasing you.

113
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,946
I swear...I was taIking
onIy about you.

114
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:23,781
Yes, of course. He was
taIking onIy about you.

115
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,090
- Did you hear?
- I'm studying with you...

116
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:29,090
...since 3 years. I know
you thoroughIy.

117
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:32,554
You didn't even teIephone me
once during the holldays!

118
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:38,435
Ah, I remembered! I wllI make a phone
call to Raj and come back.

119
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:41,504
Be seated. I wllI be back soon.

120
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:54,584
Let's go to our cIassrooms.

121
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,781
Who attends cIasses
on the first day?

122
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,958
They need to take notes too.

123
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,836
I don't llke such misbehaviour.

124
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,974
Where am I misbehaving?

125
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:24,307
Leave my hand.

126
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,479
The situation changed
during my absence.

127
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,551
Leave the girI's hand.

128
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,486
- I won't.
- You won't?

129
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,319
A true man has grabbed
a girI's hand.

130
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:41,863
Is it? Do you have enough strength
to hoId a man's hand?

131
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,700
I knew he doesn't have
that much courage.

132
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:48,640
Hey! He Ieft a girI's hand.
He's not a true man!

133
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,974
ScoundreI! You are hitting me?

134
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,248
What are you peopIe upto?

135
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,394
HoId on!

136
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:20,531
You're kicking me, are you?

137
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,075
You are ruining everything.

138
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,901
Remove it first.

139
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:33,880
You've arrived, Raj!

140
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,213
My handsome has arrived!

141
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:41,052
Now tell me...have many
goons do you have?

142
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,488
Now that my friend has come,

143
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,821
I won't spare you.
Oome on, Raj.

144
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,699
Where are you, Raj?

145
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:56,405
You are sitting here, Raj?
Let's go and bash them up.

146
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,577
No? Are you not my friend, Raj?

147
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:04,579
You aren't? All right, then.
Do you think I can't fight them?

148
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:09,244
I wllI fight them singIe-handedIy
and overpower them.

149
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,125
I am really going.

150
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:36,114
Hey! What're you peopIe upto?
My furniture is being damaged!

151
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:43,783
Hey! What're you doing? Why're
you putting me inside a fridge?

152
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:46,618
Gosh!

153
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,301
You wllI be a dead man, Boney!

154
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,474
Get up, Boney!

155
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:19,816
- Who are you?
- I am SheetaI.

156
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,851
Who's SheetaI?

157
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,486
It's you, traitor?

158
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,062
Raj, how can you just
stand and stare?

159
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:32,602
Your friend has been so badIy
beaten up. Do you llke it?

160
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,735
PIease heIp Boney!

161
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:42,345
If he pays me 100 rupees,
I'll bash them up singIe-handedIy.

162
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:48,042
He says that he wllI bash them
all singIe-handedIy.

163
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:53,257
- What if you don't bash them up?
- Then I wllI pay you 200 rupees.

164
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,858
200 rupees? All right, then.
The bet is on.

165
00:19:57,062 --> 00:20:00,190
Go and bash them up.

166
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,203
Just see...when Raj
comes back...

167
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:09,905
...he wouId be in
a pathetic state.

168
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,659
He's really beating them up.

169
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:58,186
What shouId I do?
My money...

170
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,108
Looks llke I'm sure
to Iose 100 rupees.

171
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:27,879
But I've onIy 50 rupees.

172
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:37,655
I'm short of 50 rupees.
PIease Iend me 50 rupees.

173
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,764
Stupid, if you don't have money,
why do you pIace bets?

174
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:55,676
Oome, PrincipaI, and see for yourseIf
how bad the situation is.

175
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:02,083
The PrincipaI is on his way!

176
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,783
The oId man has come. Run!

177
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:17,664
See for yourseIf, sir.
My canteen is in shambIes.

178
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:25,109
What is wrong here?

179
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:29,045
There was a scuffIe going on
just a whlle ago.

180
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,005
All of them are eating cordially.

181
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:40,153
There was a big fight going on
here just a whlle ago.

182
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,924
But there's peace all around.

183
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:46,189
You aIways compIain wrongIy
about the students.

184
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:51,530
I wllI get your canteen shut. You
wasted my time. I'm Ieaving now.

185
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,439
I wllI remember you peopIe.

186
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,704
I wllI trap you some day
in such a manner...

187
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,208
...that you won't forget it
all your llfe.

188
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,111
Go away, wllI you?
You are being very...

189
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:08,716
Enough of your dispIay of strength.
Give me 100 rupees now.

190
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:14,748
My friend, I am short
of 50 rupees.

191
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,554
- Let me have that!
- He's taken that money too.

192
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:22,260
On the first day at college, we
induIge in ragging of students.

193
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,959
But this year, the programme
is sllghtIy changed.

194
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:26,899
Instead of the students...

195
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,970
...we'll be ragging the staff
members and the professors.

196
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,575
- How wllI we do that?
- This is how.

197
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,850
We wllI mix this medicine into the
bottIe and feed it...

198
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,915
...to the professors
and staff members.

199
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:45,449
As soon as they consume it, they'll
start winking. Like this.

200
00:23:57,702 --> 00:24:00,068
It has been a Iong time since I drank
a cup of tea prepared by you.

201
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:04,603
Make time some day,
and come over to my pIace.

202
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,107
PIease have it.

203
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:16,086
What's the matter?
I can't find our P.T. professor.

204
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:20,585
He is a romantic. He must be
coming at a IeisureIy pace.

205
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,825
- PIease have it, sir.
- What is this?

206
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,627
On this first day to college,
llI the students...00 24 28 05,00 24 31 15,...have given a small tre
to weIcome all of you.

207
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:42,670
Hurry up, Raj.

208
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:49,379
Raj, all the professors have
started winking at each other.

209
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,553
But what're you doing?

210
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,492
Whichever professor comes
here furiousIy...

211
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,994
...we wllI pacify his anger
with a shower of fIowers.

212
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,060
What an idea!

213
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,801
Let's take our seats.

214
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,719
Hey! Where has sir disappeared?

215
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:12,398
Wow! You have Iaid out
fIowers on my path?

216
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:20,405
This is the first day
at the college.

217
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:27,550
And I can even see some new
faces among the students.

218
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,917
I think you are a new student.

219
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:41,927
What's there to Iaugh about?

220
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:45,165
What's your name?

221
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,297
Such a beautifuI name!

222
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:52,837
What misbehaviour is this?

223
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:56,143
I wllI go and compIain
to the principaI rightaway.

224
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:57,076
But why?

225
00:26:59,284 --> 00:26:59,841
But llsten...

226
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,049
I want to meet the PrincipaI.

227
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:18,632
Yes?

228
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,532
- What kind of a college is this?
- It's a good college.

229
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:22,965
The Professor and the peon
misbehaved with me.

230
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:24,471
What kind of misbehaviour?

231
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:29,745
How shouId I tell you?
They winked at me.

232
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:32,215
What? They winked at you?

233
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:36,312
Such misbehaviour wllI never
be toIerated in this college.

234
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:40,315
I wllI summon the staff members
this evening and take action.

235
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:41,952
You may Ieave now.

236
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:46,487
- Who's Raj?
- The one...

237
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,496
- ...who showered fIowers on you.
- I see. He's Raj?

238
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:53,159
Yes. He mixed some medicine
in the soft drink...

239
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:56,534
...after drinking which the entire
staff started winking at each other.

240
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,342
Students who pIay such pranks
on their teachers...

241
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:02,342
...shouId be thrown out
of the college.

242
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:04,412
No, no...Raj is not such a boy.

243
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:13,290
Hello, NeeIam dear!

244
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,555
How has been your first
day at college, NeeIam?

245
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:19,263
It has been fine.

246
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:22,364
Let me introduce you to SheetaI,
my cIassmate. And he's my UncIe.

247
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:28,937
I've made arrangements for your
stay at the Ladies HosteI.

248
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,539
Oome and see the pIace yourseIf.

249
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:34,368
Moreover, I've to return
to Pune this evening itseIf.

250
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:37,274
Why don't you stay back
for a few more days?

251
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:40,708
It has been a week since
I've come here.

252
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,714
Moreover, there's nobody to
Iook after the business in Pune.

253
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:47,892
And how far is Mumbai from Pune?
I wllI come whenever I llke.

254
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:51,892
Wow! It means NeeIam wllI llve here
in a hosteI? All aIone in Bombay?

255
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:55,431
- It means your llne is cIear.
- Yes.

256
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:59,901
Don't try to taIk to her
thinking her to be aIone.

257
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,673
Otherwise she wllI beat you up
with her sandaI.

258
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:10,511
She's furious at you.
She was abusing you severeIy.

259
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:16,244
- She's really furious at you.
- Forget it. Love begins with abuses.

260
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:20,083
Didn't you see how she was Iooking at
me when the fIowers fell on her?

261
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:23,325
She overwheImed me
at first sight.

262
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:26,990
It's true. Even I am an
eye-witness to this fact.

263
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:32,598
If I tell NeeIam that
I Iove her...

264
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:34,828
...I'm confident that she wllI
aIso say that she Ioves me too.

265
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:38,770
If she says this, I wllI
give you whatever you want.

266
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:44,444
Don't say that. Just ask me
how much I've Iost.

267
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:49,951
- You wllI Iose too.
- It is just not possibIe.

268
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:53,357
There's the Rose Day
in the next few days.

269
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:57,552
Whichever boy Ioves a girI,
offers a red rose to the girI.

270
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:02,956
And if the girI too Ioves him,
she smlles and accepts the rose.

271
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:06,570
I wllI sureIy make NeeIam
accept a red rose.

272
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,405
What an idea!

273
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:12,371
NeeIam wllI throw the rose
back on his face.

274
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,807
Is it? And what if
she accepts the fIower?

275
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,143
- How about a bet of 50 rupees?
- Yes, of course. Just a minute.

276
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:22,478
- Shall I pIace the bet?
- Yes, go ahead.

277
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:24,382
- I hope I won't Iose.
- Rest assured.

278
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,157
What if NeeIam doesn't
accept the fIower?

279
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:32,821
You have confidence on me,
don't you?

280
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:35,828
- Yes, I have.
- Then just reIax.

281
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:43,835
Raj, Iet's hide. Otherwise
she wllI take the fIower.

282
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:47,009
I got a yellow fIower of
friendship with great difficuIty.

283
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:51,010
But there's not a singIe
handsome youngster...

284
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:54,049
...who wouId offer me a red
rose saying 'I Iove you'.

285
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:15,865
How dare you!

286
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:34,852
Run away from here!

287
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:46,665
- Why're you hiding here?
- We are hiding from that girI.

288
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:49,570
If she sees us, we wllI have to
give her a red rose forcibIy.

289
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:52,902
NeeIam is coming this way.

290
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,481
Meet me after the Iecture.

291
00:31:57,682 --> 00:32:01,015
Wait here. I wllI give her
the fIower and come back.

292
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,810
Hurry up.

293
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:06,787
He wllI sureIy give the
red rose to NeeIam.

294
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:13,759
Ms NeeIam...whatever happened
that day in the cIassroom...

295
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:15,933
...because of me, I am very
embarrassed because of it.

296
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:24,098
Listen...accept this white fIower
and Iet's end our fight.

297
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:32,613
- She accepted the fIower, didn't she?
- She accepted onIy a white fIower.

298
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:36,947
Listen...our fight has ended.

299
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:41,949
Now accept the yellow fIower
for our friendship.

300
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:47,130
See...she's accepted
the yellow fIower too.

301
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:51,295
That's no good. Let him offer the
red rose. Then you wllI know.

302
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:54,528
- Just a minute, NeeIam.
- What now?

303
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:58,407
Now that we've become friends,
Iove shouIdn't be far behind.

304
00:32:58,609 --> 00:32:59,541
Just a minute!

305
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:02,238
Here!

306
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:11,050
How did you dare to
give me this fIower?

307
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:20,428
- Give me 50 rupees. Rightaway!
- I've had it!

308
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,660
I onIy have 26 rupees.
WllI it do?

309
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:27,995
- You never pay up the full amount.
- I wllI pay you the next time.

310
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:30,331
Raj is an idiot!

311
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:36,907
You Iost the bet, didn't you?

312
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,674
What does she think of herseIf?

313
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:49,082
So you had mixed the winking
medicine in everybody's drink.

314
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,715
You are being suspended
from college for a week.

315
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:56,383
- But, sir...
- No ifs and buts.

316
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:59,554
- But llsten to me, sir.
- You shouId llsten to me.

317
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:20,948
Hey!

318
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:30,518
I've had it. HeIp me!

319
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,726
There's so much heat in their Iove.
Ohickens came out of the eggs.

320
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,866
Daughter, is this the
time to return?

321
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:55,042
Your college ends at 12 o'cIock.
It's 5 in the evening now.

322
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:56,008
Where were you all the whlle?

323
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:01,513
It was great fun at the college.

324
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:02,242
Is it?

325
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:05,684
Raj and Boney had a tough time
eating rotten tomatoes and eggs.

326
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,085
- What? Rotten eggs and tomatoes?
- Yes.

327
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,692
Such dirty things are given
to be eaten at your college.

328
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:13,591
Now I know why your heaIth has
been deteriorating gradually.

329
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:15,526
But llsten to me first...

330
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:16,859
I don't want to hear a thing.

331
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:19,930
Henceforth, you won't even drink
water in your college canteen.

332
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:23,072
- You don't understand anything.
- But daughter...

333
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:24,102
Sir...

334
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:27,273
The guests have arrived.
They're expecting you.

335
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:30,905
- Greetings.
- PIease be seated.

336
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,946
How are the preparations
for the eIections progressing?

337
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:36,717
The opposition party has
firmIy entangIed the publlc...

338
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:39,651
...in their web of
speeches and promises.

339
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:45,218
Then we wllI provide the
publlc with rations.

340
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:50,460
To pIay the game of polltics,
one needs the power of weaIth.

341
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:52,969
And I have weaIth.

342
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:56,934
Mr. Kallash, we had spent
quite a sum Iast time too.

343
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:00,073
Actually, we want the
sympathy of the publlc.

344
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,422
You are right.

345
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:25,934
Let me take care of
what needs to be done...

346
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:27,568
...to win publlc's sympathy.

347
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:33,534
Gosh!

348
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:37,345
You?

349
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:43,381
- I suppose you aren't hurt.
- No.

350
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:45,280
You must've been hurt here.

351
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:46,784
No, I am not hurt anywhere.

352
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:50,820
- You must be hurt over there.
- I'm not hurt anywhere.

353
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:53,457
He's taking chances.

354
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:56,599
I think that...
Hey! She's hurt!

355
00:43:57,368 --> 00:44:01,634
When she says that she isn't hurt,
why don't you belleve it?

356
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:03,802
You peopIe onIy need excuses.

357
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,146
What a strange girI she is!

358
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:19,621
- Hey! I wanted this book.
- All right. You read it first.

359
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:23,725
No, you read it. I have read
this topic in your eyes.

360
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:34,895
- Your name?
- Miss NeeIam.

361
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:38,336
- Raj MaIhotra.
- Miss NeeIam Raj MaIhotra.

362
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:42,501
- No, Mrs. NeeIam Raj MaIhotra.
- What're you doing?

363
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,179
Let him go.
It's Iunch time for him.

364
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:47,850
But he has written the name
as NeeIam Raj MaIhotra.

365
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:48,416
Is it?

366
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:49,778
Yes. Know what that means?

367
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:50,351
What does it mean?

368
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:51,680
It means that...

369
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:02,257
Some day or the other,
we have to be united.

370
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:03,562
Why not from today itseIf?

371
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:56,651
- Boney, what's this going on?
- SeIection is going on.

372
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:59,153
GirIs from our college are
going to Nasik for 7 days...

373
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:00,660
...for the basketball tournament.

374
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,332
But NeeIam and SheetaI don't
know how to pIay basketball.

375
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:09,368
So what? They are
beautifuI, at Ieast.

376
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:13,709
The college wllI appear
very IoneIy without NeeIam.

377
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:16,002
So what?

378
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:18,573
Let's do something.
Let us go too.

379
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:22,780
Are you mad? They wllI be staying
at the girI's hosteI there.

380
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:26,017
And if we go there
even by mistake...

381
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:27,688
...we wllI sureIy be bashed up.

382
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:32,023
Listen.

383
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:33,129
- No, friend.
- Let's do it.

384
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,887
- No, it's not possibIe.
- But there's no harm in it.

385
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:21,973
Oan we get a llft tllI Nasik?

386
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:27,845
We have missed the Iast bus of the
day. It'll be dark soon.

387
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:32,645
How wllI we beautifuI girIs llve
in this jungIe all by ourseIves?

388
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:34,414
PIease come.

389
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:06,482
Where are you going?

390
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:09,287
We're going to Nasik to participate
in a basketball tournament.

391
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:10,926
I see...

392
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:29,703
Your name is NeeIam, isn't it?

393
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:30,909
How do you know?

394
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:33,143
I know everything about you.

395
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:37,152
The name of the person about whom
you're thinking begins with an 'R'.

396
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:39,481
- I even know that.
- How did you know?

397
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:41,054
By Iooking at your hand!

398
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:54,426
Driver, it's so hot
near the engine.

399
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:56,728
I wllI sit somewhere behind.

400
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:16,187
What's your name?

401
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,356
What's your name?

402
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:41,984
- Where wllI you llve at Nasik?
- At VithaIdas HosteI.

403
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:47,086
We too wllI be llving there.

404
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:47,984
- What?
- Yes.

405
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:52,119
- You too wllI be there?
- Yes.

406
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:23,815
I'm trapped. That professor
has fallen in Iove with me.

407
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:25,751
He has even written a Ietter to me.

408
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:28,931
He has asked me to meet him in
the garden to romance.

409
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:32,827
So what? He'll wait and go away. He
won't come inside this Iadies hosteI.

410
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:36,434
- I am going to meet NeeIam.
- Go ahead.

411
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,271
- Where are you going?
You know...NeeIam, my friend...

412
00:54:46,483 --> 00:54:49,145
...neither can she sIeep,
nor does she Iet me sIeep.

413
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:52,116
So I thought of going to
some other room to sIeep.

414
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:54,856
- That's very nice.
- Very nice?

415
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:58,621
I'm aIso not feellng sIeepy.

416
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:01,455
So I thought of chatting
with somebody.

417
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:04,133
You know what? Go to NeeIam's
room to chat with her.

418
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:06,802
I wllI go to your room
and sIeep with Honey.

419
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:12,873
Boney has had it.

420
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:23,477
- Are you asIeep, Honey?
- Yes.

421
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:27,249
- So you are awake?
- Yes.

422
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,481
Why're you shivering so much?

423
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:34,322
I'm feellng so chllIy. Looks
llke I'm suffering from fever.

424
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:40,335
- I wllI go and call somebody.
- No, no. That won't be necessary.

425
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:43,673
Once I go to sIeep,
everything wllI be fine.

426
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,771
Let me rub baIm
on your chest.

427
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:52,680
No, no. Not on my chest.
Rub it on my back, if you wish.

428
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:04,526
You aren't wearing any cIothes.

429
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:10,931
I am used to sIeeping
without any cIothes.

430
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:17,501
That wllI be enough.
Let's go to sIeep now.

431
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:26,614
Such big hair on your feet?

432
00:56:28,284 --> 00:56:29,546
Don't you use a hair-remover?

433
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:43,292
I do. I use a hair-remover.
But hair grows back again.

434
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:48,904
I am very tired now.
Let's go to sIeep now.

435
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,908
Now I understand why you
are unabIe to sIeep.

436
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:06,285
Supposing if Raj comes here.
What then?

437
00:57:07,323 --> 00:57:12,090
- But how wllI Raj come here?
- Lovers can come anywhere.

438
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:17,122
Supposing if Raj comes here,
you'll embrace him joyfully.

439
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:23,770
Yes. I wouId definiteIy llke to.
But I won't give in so easlly.

440
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:28,768
I wllI first act pricey
and hard-to-get.

441
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:31,571
Then I wllI tell him
to go away from here.

442
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:34,546
- What if somebody sees us?
- And then?

443
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:39,946
What then? When he's about to Ieave,
I wllI stop him, and appease him.

444
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:42,792
Then I wllI Iook into his
eyes and say...

445
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:51,791
Didn't I say that Iovers
can come anywhere?

446
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:25,320
I've had it today.
Where shouId I hide?

447
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:29,031
I wllI hide under this.

448
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:47,377
Wow! She sent away her friend?

449
01:04:48,484 --> 01:04:52,318
Looks llke she too
is equally excited.

450
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:00,056
Honey!

451
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:11,069
Yes?
Why have you come here?

452
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:16,337
I was freezing even as I stood
outside in the garden.

453
01:05:16,946 --> 01:05:21,440
If anybody sees you coming here,
I wllI get a bad name.

454
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:23,250
Nobody has seen me.

455
01:05:23,986 --> 01:05:25,954
Go away from here.

456
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,084
Go away? Without doing anything?

457
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,057
Did you pIan to do something?

458
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:33,421
Yes.

459
01:05:34,063 --> 01:05:38,432
I wanted to taIk to you about Iove,
which I couIdn't in the bus.

460
01:05:38,968 --> 01:05:40,765
I forgot to give you this.

461
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:43,833
Look what I've brought for you.

462
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:46,500
PIease Iook.

463
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:53,342
I've been fooIed!

464
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:07,994
Dear NeeIam, your UncIe
hasn't come as yet.

465
01:06:08,564 --> 01:06:11,124
I have teIephoned.
He must be coming.

466
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:14,130
No, Mr. Kallashnath.
You don't need to come.

467
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:19,300
I've arranged for thier ball.
Rest assured.

468
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:24,145
PIease sign here.

469
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:30,151
OonstabIe, reIease those peopIe.

470
01:06:33,189 --> 01:06:40,322
How wonderfuI! I called you here
to know how yourjall-trip was.

471
01:06:40,896 --> 01:06:44,332
I suppose you mustn't have bothered
about your famlly's good name.

472
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,830
But, Daddy, we aren't
to be bIamed for this.

473
01:06:47,036 --> 01:06:53,168
Actually, it is my fauIt that
I allowed you such llberties.

474
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:58,579
Why did you two have to
side with these two ruffians?

475
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:01,873
We didn't know when these two
came there dressed as girIs.

476
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:04,345
We onIy got to know in
the hosteI room that...

477
01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:05,850
...the girIs are none other than
Raj and Boney. Isn't it, SheetaI?

478
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:06,851
UncIe, she's Iying.

479
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:09,490
UncIe, they are Iying!

480
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:11,783
Why wouId I lle?
What wrong have I done?

481
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:16,357
My UncIe has sent me here to study,
not to fooI around llke you.

482
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:19,194
We aren't used to foollng around
llke you two peopIe.

483
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:24,364
Whenever I study, Boney asks me
to discontinue with my studies...

484
01:07:24,573 --> 01:07:26,700
...and that I wouIdn't achieve much
by passing in first grade.

485
01:07:26,942 --> 01:07:28,375
She's Iying.

486
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:35,209
- Let's go and study in your room.
- That's good, dear.

487
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:39,218
- Oarry on girIs.
- Daddy, we won't eat food today.

488
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:42,451
Food causes one to sIeep earIy.
And we are unabIe to study.

489
01:07:42,758 --> 01:07:45,386
All right. But do drink
fruitjuices. Go ahead.

490
01:07:45,594 --> 01:07:47,221
- Yes.
- Oarry on.

491
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:52,397
See? Both of them are
so fond of studying.

492
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:58,096
And you said that they won't achieve
much by passing in first grade.

493
01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:00,065
You shouId be ashamed.

494
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:02,244
You shouId make good use
of your schoIarship...

495
01:08:02,445 --> 01:08:03,571
...and make a good llfe
for yourseIf.

496
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:07,081
And you are the younger brother
of Inspector Suresh, aren't you?

497
01:08:07,616 --> 01:08:10,414
I wllI teIephone him rightaway and
ask him to stop your studies...

498
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:12,246
...and get you admitted to some
theatre group and that you are...

499
01:08:12,455 --> 01:08:14,753
...very fond of dressing up as a
girI. I'll teIephone him rightaway.

500
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:24,094
PIease don't...UncIe.
I beg of you.

501
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:27,663
PIease don't teIephone my brother.
He's a very strict person.

502
01:08:28,337 --> 01:08:30,066
You may punish us
however you llke.

503
01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:33,537
I promise you. You won't have
any reason to compIain again.

504
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:36,275
I'll teIephone your brother
rightaway and ask him...

505
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,106
...to get you admitted to some
theatre group and that you are...

506
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:39,611
...very fond of dressing
up as a girI.

507
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:46,682
I beg of you. Don't teIephone my
brother. He's a strict person.

508
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:48,447
Enough.

509
01:08:49,091 --> 01:08:50,956
Both of you cornered me in
your UncIe's presence.

510
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:52,286
And now you are making
fun of me?

511
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:57,125
You were under such a pathetic
state in Daddy's presence.

512
01:08:57,333 --> 01:09:00,131
I respect your Daddy very much.

513
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:04,133
If I want, I can make your Daddy
to pIead and beg before me.

514
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,704
My Daddy wouId beg before you?

515
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:11,307
- Do you want to pIace a bet?
- Let it be.

516
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:12,981
Don't pIace a bet if
you don't want to.

517
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:16,317
I can say with a challenge
that I wouId emerge victorious.

518
01:09:17,253 --> 01:09:19,983
- What do you say?
- I bet an amount of 500 rupees.

519
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:21,986
- I am aIso betting.
- All right then.

520
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:24,920
We three're together.
And you're on the other side.

521
01:09:25,127 --> 01:09:29,894
But you'll have to force UncIe
to pIead and beg before you.

522
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:32,499
All right, then. Let's meet tomorrow
at our reguIar meeting point.

523
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:47,843
- Let's go.
- Yes.

524
01:10:13,008 --> 01:10:14,703
Why don't you Iook where
you're driving?

525
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:18,111
And can't you cross the road
with your eyes open?

526
01:10:19,848 --> 01:10:20,872
Let's go.

527
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:35,226
- Where are we going?
- Manori IsIand.

528
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,129
But the bet is about
scaring my Daddy.

529
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:40,393
That's what I'll be doing.

530
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:43,797
We wllI remain at Manori
IsIand tllI evening.

531
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:47,237
Your Daddy wllI be worried
when you don't return home.

532
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,007
Then I wllI teIephone him...

533
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:53,143
...saying that his daughter
has been kidnapped.

534
01:10:54,116 --> 01:10:58,416
When he hears this, he wllI
pIead and beg to me...

535
01:10:58,787 --> 01:11:00,152
...saying that I shouId
return him his daughter.

536
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:01,988
But I wllI tell him...

537
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:07,260
But I wllI tell him that
I need 5 Iakh rupees.

538
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:08,820
Otherwise his daughter...!

539
01:11:09,632 --> 01:11:12,260
Looks llke I've Iost
this bet too.

540
01:11:12,635 --> 01:11:15,627
Keep the 250 out of the
500 rupees towards the bet.

541
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:17,235
I wllI pay the rest tomorrow.

542
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:19,930
NeeIam...SheetaI. Pay him rightaway.

543
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:21,700
Why now? Let him make
the phone call first.

544
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:24,936
I'm in no hurry. Give me the
money after I make the call.

545
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:30,174
What nonsense? Why did you kidnap
my daughter? Who're you?

546
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:31,302
I am a big kidnapper.
