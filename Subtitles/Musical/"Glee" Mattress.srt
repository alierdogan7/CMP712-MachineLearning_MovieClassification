1
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:06,368
<i>Here's what you missed last week. Emma and Ken
are getting married, though she really likes Will.</i>

2
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:08,873
<i>If we were gonna rank
crush-worthy teachers at this school...</i>

3
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,136
you'd be number one with a bullet.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,643
<i>Which Ken's kind of noticed...</i>

5
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:13,042
<i>which makes him really not like Will.</i>

6
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:16,048
The whole world knows
I'm just a consolation prize to you.

7
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:17,310
How do you think that makes me feel?

8
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:20,046
<i>- Also, Terri says she's pregnant.
- Wow.</i>

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,553
<i>But really she's faking,
and Mr. Schuester doesn't know.</i>

10
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:23,748
This baby's the only reason he's still here.

11
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:25,085
<i>Will's busy getting
the kids ready for sectionals...</i>

12
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:26,557
<i>where they're up
against a school for the deaf.</i>

13
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:30,722
- I can't hear you. Talk into this ear. Scarlet fever.
- You're on!

14
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:35,097
<i>- And a group of juvie girls.
- Aphasia, give Mr. Schuester his wallet back.</i>

15
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:39,062
<i>But it turns out
both of them are really good.</i>

16
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,572
It's like cool epilepsy.

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,904
<i>Sue kicked Quinn out of the Cheerios
because she's pregnant.</i>

18
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:45,137
I can't have a pregnant girl on my squad.

19
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,679
<i>- You're a disgrace.
- That's not very nice, but neither is Sue.</i>

20
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,738
Those drinks are crap!

21
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,511
<i>- And that's what you missed on...
- ¶¶ Glee ¶¶</i>

22
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,325
<i>- Hey, guys. Mind if I join you?
- Hmm.</i>

23
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:07,958
- So, what's with all the primping?
- Yearbook pictures.

24
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:11,629
<i>This is the 50th edition
of the McKinley High School Thunderclap.</i>

25
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:14,730
I'm gonna drop 20 pounds by Friday,
look smokin' hot for that photo...

26
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,276
and be down to a trim 210
for the wedding a week Saturday.

27
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,811
<i>Of course the, um...
the wedding was gonna be in Hawaii...</i>

28
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:22,279
but then they told me
I couldn't bring my own fruit.

29
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:25,112
- So...
- But sectionals is a week from Saturday.

30
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,015
Oh, man.

31
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,113
Looks like you won't be able
to make it, M&M.

32
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:35,186
I, um... I totally forgot about sectionals.

33
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:38,890
I'm-I'm sorry.
I wanted to go... for the kids.

34
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,990
<i>We are not rescheduling.</i>

35
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:42,796
The V.F.W. hall is booked till next June.

36
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,803
The only reason this Saturday is available...

37
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,203
is 'cause it's the one-year anniversary
of that grisly fish-fry shoot-out.

38
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,071
I got a monster discount. We just got to be
out of there before the candlelight vigil.

39
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,134
l-l... I remember.

40
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:54,579
Oh, my gosh.

41
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:58,242
<i>Sue? Did someone finally punch you?</i>

42
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:02,414
Edie. William. You.

43
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,889
<i>Every year when the photos
for the Thunderclap come around...</i>

44
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,892
I always elect to have a little work done.

45
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,157
<i>This year I got myself a bit of an eye lift.</i>

46
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,859
And while they were in there, I told them
to go ahead and yank out those tear ducts.

47
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:19,064
Wasn't using 'em. You know, I got
a storage unit full of trophies and medallions.

48
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,232
But for the rest of you educators...

49
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,174
these yearbook pictures are really
the only concrete proof you have...

50
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:28,772
that anything you've done in your sorry
little lives has made any difference whatsoever.

51
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:31,783
My Cheerios are so excited.

52
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:35,548
<i>Got 'em on a yam diet.
Draws the water out of the skin.</i>

53
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,590
Well, I'm sure my Glee kids
are gonna be excited too.

54
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,717
- Well, Glee kids don't get a photo.
- What?

55
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:44,126
- Why is that?
- I just had a meeting
with Principal Figgins, Eleanor.

56
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:47,462
<i>And what with all the vandalism
of the Glee Club photos over the years...</i>

57
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,662
<i>I convinced him that putting the Glee kids
in this year's Thunderclap...</i>

58
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:55,367
was subjecting the little freaks
to more humiliation and ridicule.

59
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,068
Hey, why can't you just accept the fact...

60
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:59,543
that my kids are gonna
take sectionals this year?

61
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:02,410
- That's not happening.
- And stop with the pointless vendetta.

62
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,575
<i>All right, this is so not fair, Sue.</i>

63
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,744
You know, I'm gonna talk
to Figgins about this.

64
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:09,151
Hey, good luck with that.

65
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:12,658
You know, you three are boring me now.
I'm gonna go do something else.

66
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,163
- Where's Rachel?
- She's not here yet.

67
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:25,932
Perfect. Glee Club stands
on a delicate precipice.

68
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:28,906
We have all felt the cold humiliation
of a Slushee in the face.

69
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,944
But as of right now,
our relative anonymity as a club...

70
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,502
shields us from more severe persecution...

71
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:37,573
swirlies, patriotic wedgies.

72
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,641
What's a patriotic wedgie?

73
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,586
It's when they hoist you up the flagpole
by your undies.

74
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:45,089
Strangely, it did make me feel more American.

75
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:48,594
<i>Based on my investigation,
I am of the opinion...</i>

76
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:51,960
that a yearbook photo would only fuel
the flames of anti-Glee Club terror.

77
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:55,364
I've done a little library research.

78
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,476
Peter Geller... Glee Club second tenor, 1998.

79
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:08,036
<i>He can be seen here with both a drawn-on
Hitler mustache and a rice paddy hat.</i>

80
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:11,606
Shortly after the yearbook came out,
Mr. Geller had a nervous breakdown.

81
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:14,619
He's now the homeless man
who sleeps in front of the public library.

82
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,712
- Patches?
- Patches.

83
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:20,452
<i>- He barks at my mom.
- Exhibit "B."</i>

84
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,654
<i>Tawny Peterson. Glee Club class of 2000.</i>

85
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,324
<i>Seen here in her photo
with a cartoon knife stuck in her head...</i>

86
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,630
<i>in a macabre tableau that in four years
would prove eerily prescient.</i>

87
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:32,330
<i>I think I speak for all of us when I say...</i>

88
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:36,000
that not having to pose for a yearbook photo
might be a blessing in disguise.

89
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,407
I suggest not fighting Figgins's ruling.

90
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,845
<i>Oh, hey, guys.
Ah, looking at old Thunderclaps?</i>

91
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:45,645
- It's really unsettling.
- And totally unfair.

92
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:48,084
Hey, can I borrow one of these?

93
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:52,250
<i>You know what? This year's Thunderclap
is gonna have a Glee Club photo...</i>

94
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,988
with every one of your smiling faces.

95
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,496
You have my word on it.

96
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,774
Schue, I'm doing the Glee Club a solid.

97
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:13,107
We're denying the opportunity
to other children to further humiliate them.

98
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:15,340
No, no, no.
Those kids get up on stage all the time...

99
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,213
no matter what anyone thinks of them...
and they perform.

100
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:21,276
They don't let anyone
or anything get to them.

101
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:24,448
That's something you should encourage.
Sue is wrong.

102
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:28,051
- Fine. I'll give them a photo.
- Thank you.

103
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:30,960
- For $1,000.
- What?

104
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,157
That's what it costs.

105
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:37,066
The yearbook
is prime advertising space, Schue.

106
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:41,835
Frederickson's Funeral Parlor
experienced a 1.3% increase in revenue...

107
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:45,742
<i>after their full-page ad
last year in the Thunderclap.</i>

108
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,144
Okay, um...

109
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:50,774
What about a quarter page?
How much does that cost?

110
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,454
$325.

111
00:05:56,522 --> 00:06:00,982
<i>That will buy you enough space
for a photo of two members of the Glee Club...</i>

112
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,552
right below the advertisement
for Uncle Sandro's Chicken Inside of a Waffle.

113
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,622
- Figgins, that's a lot of money.
- It's a compromise, Schue.

114
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,636
Now, I suggest you select the good-looking
cheerleader... not the pregnant one...

115
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,467
<i>and the quarterback for the photo...</i>

116
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:17,066
as their faces are less likely
to be scratched out with safety pins.

117
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,111
<i>Mr. Schuester,
I'm very sorry to interrupt.</i>

118
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:22,807
Principal Figgins, as you very well may know,
this is my first year in Glee Club...

119
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,749
and I've just been informed that New Directions
has not been afforded a yearbook photo.

120
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,719
<i>As you might expect, my two gay dads
have a very close relationship...</i>

121
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,780
- with our local branch of the A.C.L. U...
- Beat you to the punch, Rachel.

122
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,326
It's all good. We're in the yearbook.

123
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,329
Oh. Fantastic.

124
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,865
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

125
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:46,865
Make fun of me all you want,
but school pictures are everything to me.

126
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,965
They're great practice
for getting photographed by the paparazzi.

127
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:53,534
Invasive as the press may be,
stars are dependent on them for their fame...

128
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:56,138
and I feel I must be prepared.

129
00:06:56,215 --> 00:07:01,448
<i>In order to do so,
I join every club I possibly can.</i>

130
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,785
<i>I know you're thinking
that I'm just joining all these clubs...</i>

131
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:07,815
<i>to give off the appearance that I'm involved,
known to exist.</i>

132
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:12,024
<i>But Glee Club is different.
I really love Glee.</i>

133
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,089
And I believe in what we stand for.

134
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:17,398
We've come from behind...
dismissed and ridiculed by everyone.

135
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,270
And we've made something of ourselves...
something that I'm proud to be a part of...

136
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,173
something I want to be remembered for.

137
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:30,909
I miss my Cheerios uniform.

138
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:34,282
It made me feel safe, contained.

139
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,651
Even when I was feeling left out...

140
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:39,316
at least I looked like
I was a part of something.

141
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:46,022
I want my kids to be able to look back
at these books and see who I was...

142
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,191
<i>make them proud.</i>

143
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:51,464
Not the bastard one
I'm carrying now, of course.

144
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:54,870
The ones I'll have
when I'm married and ready.

145
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:57,705
I might not look like
the head cheerleader anymore...

146
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,405
<i>but I'm still her on the inside.</i>

147
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,313
Hmm. I'm done playing the victim.

148
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:06,010
When that cheerleading picture
is taken for the yearbook...

149
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:08,053
I'm gonna be in it and back on the squad...

150
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,283
whether Sue Sylvester likes it or not.

151
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,951
Hey, baby, which one of these ties
goes better with my shirt?

152
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:17,587
- You're blocking the TV, Will.
- Oh, come on. I need your help.

153
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:22,566
- School pictures are coming up.
- Oh. Well, in that case, um...

154
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:26,571
Wear the red one for the teacher photo
and the green one for the Glee Club.

155
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,630
It'll pop more when the cool kids deface it.

156
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,509
Yeah. I, uh...

157
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,876
I wanted to talk to you about that.

158
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:38,781
So Figgins stopped putting
the Glee Club photo in the yearbook...

159
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,319
because it always gets vandalized and...

160
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:45,255
I just feel so bad for the kids. I mean,
they work so hard. They deserve to be recognized.

161
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:49,158
Not being in that book gives the appearance
that Glee Club isn't important.

162
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:56,265
I wanna buy an ad and use it
as the Glee Club photo spread.

163
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,405
It's around $300.

164
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,600
Oh, great.

165
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:07,635
Why don't you take the food out of the
refrigerator and just give that to the kids?

166
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:11,080
Will, that food goes from my mouth
right into our baby's belly.

167
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,778
We have a couple hundred bucks left over
from selling the Blue Bomber II.

168
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,686
- The answer's no, Will. No.
- But if we...

169
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:20,021
No. No.

170
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,957
No.

171
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:35,473
Actually, can you wait to cash that
until Thursday?

172
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,982
Kurt, I have a fantastic idea for a club...

173
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:49,078
that would officially make me the most
involved student in the whole school.

174
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,749
I want us to start a "Gay Lesb All."

175
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:54,588
- I'm sorry?
- The Gay Lesbian Alliance.

176
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,992
"Gay Lesb All."

177
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:01,890
Hey, guys, great news.

178
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,334
<i>Glee Club gets a photo in the Thunderclap.</i>

179
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,803
<i>- Uh-huh.
- Whoo!</i>

180
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:10,467
It's gonna show everyone at the school
that Glee Club is on its way up.

181
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:14,707
<i>When we win regionals, those Claps
are going to be collector's items.</i>

182
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,307
<i>All of your classmates
are going to be begging for your autographs.</i>

183
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,183
But I had to compromise to do it.

184
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:26,656
Um, we only get a quarter page in back...

185
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:30,787
which means we have to pick
two team captains to appear in the photo.

186
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:34,424
So tomorrow we're gonna put it to a vote.

187
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,197
<i>- Exciting, huh? All right.
- Yeah!</i>

188
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:48,711
- Well, we're all here. I guess we should vote.
- With your permission...

189
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:50,681
I have prepared a few words.

190
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,012
- I nominate Rachel.
- Second.

191
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,211
<i>All right, let's vote up in this piece.</i>

192
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:57,881
I got to go hit the gym and load up
the "Guns of Puckerone" for the football picture.

193
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,860
Looks like everybody voted for Rachel.

194
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,057
Including Rachel.

195
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,898
- But we need two captains, guys.
- Why two?

196
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,337
<i>We're fine with having Rachel represent us
in the Thunderclap by herself.</i>

197
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:18,309
We'd actually prefer it.

198
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:22,143
<i>The worst part is that after all this time,
they're still embarrassed to be in Glee Club.</i>

199
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,546
They still see themselves as losers.

200
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:28,883
<i>I just need to get one of them
to step up and become co captain.</i>

201
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:32,754
Well, maybe you should let them
use the captain they already elected.

202
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:36,420
<i>You know, sometimes things sound
a lot different coming from a peer...</i>

203
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,986
even if that peer is as annoying as Rachel.

204
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,727
None of this is gonna matter
if they win at sectionals.

205
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:48,001
I'm really sorry I can't be there.

206
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:52,209
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about that.

207
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:56,339
I-I kind of think Ken scheduled your wedding
the same day on purpose...

208
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:59,816
you know, so... so you couldn't go.

209
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,581
Why would he do that?

210
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:08,594
Come on. We-We both know
how he feels about our... relationship.

211
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,026
I'm marrying Ken, Will.

212
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,261
Look, I know that I've...

213
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:19,964
I've definitely given him reason in the past
to be jealous.

214
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,337
But I need you to know
that I'm done with that now.

215
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,501
Ken has a lot of flaws.

216
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,943
He has 74 flaws as of yesterday.

217
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:31,278
But you know what? He's not vindictive.
He's actually a very good man.

218
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,148
He is kind, and he is great
with the students here at McKinley.

219
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,316
We have that in common. And yes,
it's true his hygiene could be a lot better.

220
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:43,384
But he is absolutely full of compassion, and...

221
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:46,329
Well, that is why I'm marrying him.

222
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,891
You're right.

223
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,904
I was out of line.

224
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,602
It won't happen again.

225
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,988
- You wanted to see me, Mr. Schue?
- Oh, yeah, Rach.

226
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,286
Sit down.

227
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:16,021
So, how's the new captaincy going?

228
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:19,155
I-I think that my unanimous election
gave me a very strong mandate...

229
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,893
- to shake things up.
- Great. Well...

230
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,427
I have a job for you, Captain.

231
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,235
We need a co captain.

232
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,575
But you have so many great ideas...

233
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,774
no reason you shouldn't have some help
pushing them through.

234
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:39,215
I could use a trusty lieutenant.

235
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,685
I do have over 65 proposals.

236
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:44,780
So... can I count on you?

237
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:48,793
No problem. I'm on it.

238
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:51,887
Um, I can't be co captain. No time. Kwanzaa.

239
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:55,365
Kwanzaa's late December, Mercedes.
The photo's this Thursday.

240
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:58,267
Yeah. I'm prepping early this year.

241
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,805
<i>¶¶ Well, you might think I'm crazy ¶¶</i>

242
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:02,864
I'd love to be in the photo, Rachel.

243
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:05,240
But you'd be standing and I'd be sitting.
It would throw off the whole composition.

244
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,711
I'll lean over.

245
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,714
But if you lean over...

246
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,717
it'll look like you have stomach rolls.

247
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,753
<i>¶¶ But I think that you're wild ¶¶¶¶</i>

248
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,550
On second thought, I don't think
that you're leadership material, Artie.

249
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,819
Follower.

250
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,453
Brittany, this is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

251
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,463
- No way.
- Why not?

252
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,965
I don't wanna be in a picture with you.
It'll get defaced.

253
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:32,493
- No, it won't.
- Yes, it will. I'll be the one doing it.

254
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:35,165
<i>I'm desperate. Glee Club needs you, Finn.</i>

255
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,175
I'm totally honored you asked me...

256
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,438
but don't you think
you should pick somebody who cares more?

257
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:43,413
Not that I don't. But I just have football
and friends and stuff.

258
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:46,076
Glee Club only started working
after you joined.

259
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:49,052
Face it, we wouldn't have all of the cheerleaders
and football players in the club...

260
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:51,089
if it wasn't for you.

261
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:54,956
You know I love Glee Club.
I just don't know why I have to represent it.

262
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,621
Because you're a leader, Finn.

263
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:03,157
And that's what leaders do. They stick their
necks out for people that they care about.

264
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,864
There are stakes here.
Morale is low. You know it.

265
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,601
If things don't change,
we're not even gonna place at sectionals...

266
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,041
and then the club is over.

267
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:15,205
- I can't do this alone.
- You don't have to.

268
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,949
I am a leader.

269
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,679
It's who I am, who I wanna be.

270
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:26,317
You got yourself a co captain.
I'll do the picture with you.

271
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,858
I totally understand that as captain
of the football team...

272
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,802
you've worked really hard
to project an appearance of steely toughness.

273
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,635
But Glee Club is different.

274
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:45,336
We have to present the appearance
of positivity and optimism.

275
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:48,471
So... we're gonna practice...

276
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:52,711
and I'm gonna teach you
how to smile correctly for your photo.

277
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:08,157
¶¶ When you first left me
I was wanting more ¶¶

278
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,633
¶¶ You were kissing that girl next door ¶¶

279
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:13,501

281
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,710

- ¶¶ Own that way ¶¶</i>

282
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:23,111

- ¶¶ Myself all day ¶¶

283
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,016
¶¶ I was so lost back then ¶¶

284
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,680
¶¶ But with a little help from my friends ¶¶

285
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:33,851
¶¶ I found the light in the tunnel at the end ¶¶

286
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,793
¶¶ And now you're calling me up on the phone ¶¶

287
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:39,660
¶¶ So you can have a little whine and a moan ¶¶

288
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:43,759
¶¶ And it's only because you're feeling alone ¶¶

289
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:48,603
- ¶¶ At first when I see you cry ¶¶
- ¶¶ When I see you cry ¶¶

290
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,972

291
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:54,672
¶¶ Yeah, it makes me smile ¶¶

292
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:58,410
¶¶ At worst I feel bad for a while ¶¶

293
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,146
<i>¶¶ But then I just smile ¶¶</i>

294
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,155

306
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,450
What the hell?

307
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,654
Hey, man. Shh.
We're practicing, dude. Chill out.

308
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,663
We heard you were gonna be
in the Glee Club photo...

309
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,131
- and we don't wanna mess up messing it up.
- Screw you, Karofsky!

310
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,134
I'm sick of you pulling people down!

311
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:53,365
Hey, man, don't talk that kumbayeyah crap.

312
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,964
All right, you know this system's
put in place to keep order around here.

313
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,134
Hey, you know what?
Look, I'm gonna give you some options, okay?

314
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,509
You want me to put the Hitler mustache
on your Glee Club picture...

315
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,844
or do you want the buck teeth
on your Glee Club picture?

316
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,680
Which one you want? Man, it don't matter
to me either way. I'll put both of...

317
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,880
Hey, how do you spell "loser"?
I'm gonna write it on his forehead.

318
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,321
His big ol' potato head.

319
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:15,952
You can write a whole haiku on that thing.

320
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:26,994
Can we shake a leg here?

321
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,209
Fine.

322
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,804
I'm ready. I'll...
do it myself.

323
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:38,873
Wait. I...

324
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,182
I insist on only being shot
from my left side.

325
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,759
Yeah, I kind of need to see your teeth.
It's sort of my job here.

326
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,460
I'm sorry. I'm just...

327
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:59,834
I'm upset.
My co captain bailed, and it just...

328
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,930
I just need a minute.

329
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,735
Snap out of this.

330
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,907
Stop being defined by what
other people think of you...

331
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,178
or how they disappoint you.

332
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,914
It's lonely at the top. You know that.

333
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,981
What's that song about overcoming
professional and personal disappointments?

334
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:21,992
Oh, yeah.

335
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,584
¶¶ When you're smiling ¶¶

336
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,220
¶¶ When you're smiling ¶¶

337
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:28,858
¶¶ The whole world smiles with you ¶¶¶¶

338
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,298
I'm ready.

339
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,719
Great.

340
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,887
Wait, wait, wait. That-That's it?

341
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,689
I practiced over 18 different poses
for this shoot...

342
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,890
and I haven't even shown you
any of my over-the-left-shoulder poses, see?

343
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:03,560
Sorry, kid. I got to blow.
I got a casting session in half an hour.

344
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,899
A... A casting session for what?

345
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,940
My brother-in-law
is shooting a commercial for his store.

346
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:12,408
I'm directing it.
I just do these school photos for the money.

347
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:18,176
<i>Uh, wa-wa... Okay.</i>

348
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,651
Wait. No. Don't.
I can take a couple more pictures for you.

349
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,248
I can cry on demand.
It's one of my many talents. I'm very versatile.

350
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,793
And aside from nudity
and the exploitation of animals...

351
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,328
I'll pretty much do anything
to break into the business.

352
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:35,831
W-Well, you certainly
seem talented and all...

353
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,835
but I-I need...

354
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,393
There's other speaking parts
in this thing.

355
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:42,304
I need, like, a bunch of other actors too.

356
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,468
I can help with that.

357
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,536
I'd like to call this meeting to order.

358
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,046
Hello, Finn. How nice of you to show.

359
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:55,780
<i>Look, I'm sorry. The guys were harassing me
in the locker room about it.</i>

360
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:59,790
If I took the Glee Club photo, they'd make me
choose between a Hitler mustache or buck teeth.

361
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,826
And I can't rock either of those looks.

362
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,425
Do you think I have a potato head?

363
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:14,404
<i>Look, I realize now that all of you think
that Glee Club is just a joke.</i>

364
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:17,465
<i>Okay? And you're convinced
that we can't win...</i>

365
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:20,739
and you're content to just sit idle by
until Figgins cancels the club.

366
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:26,250
<i>Well, I'm about to present to you
a rare opportunity...</i>

367
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:29,685
the opportunity to become... stars.

368
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:31,347
How?

369
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,718
We've all been cast in a local commercial.

370
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,921
Are you serious?

371
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:42,160
Yes, Finn. And while all of you have been
so concerned with your appearance in this school...

372
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,862
I've landed Glee Club its first big break.

373
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:47,598
<i>Simply put, making us all celebrities.</i>

374
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:53,009
<i>Okay, and no one messes with celebrities
or defaces their pictures.</i>

375
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:57,276
- What's the commercial?
- Hold on to your hats and get ready to sell...

376
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,114
some mattresses.

377
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:02,881
Awesome.

378
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,751
I'm gonna get a nice pair
of black suspenders.

379
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,690
My mom's gonna be really proud.

380
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,750
Let's do our camera face.

381
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,228
I can't believe we're finally
breaking into the biz.

382
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:20,897
You guys, I want us
to always remember this moment.

383
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:23,839
Soon there may be agents
and managers and movie deals.

384
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:28,369
But right now I want us to remember what
it feels like to be here together as a team.

385
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:32,816
Whatever. As soon as I get my record deal,
I'm not speaking to any of you.

386
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:37,453
Okay, guys,
we're very excited to have you here.

387
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,513
We here at Mattress Land believe...

388
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:41,991
that mattresses aren't just
for sleeping and fornicating anymore.

389
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,928
We believe that buying
an affordable mattress should be fun.

390
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,988
All right, let's go over the script.

391
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,728
I think it's pretty brilliant.
I wrote it myself. Action.

392
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:53,270
Ah, me.

393
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:59,243
- What's wrong?
- We just lost our jobs... at the factory.

394
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,279
<i>And we can't get a good night's sleep.</i>

395
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:04,372
<i>Chipper up! Come on down to Mattress Land!</i>

396
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:09,011
We've got near wholesale prices
to fit your style and pocketbook.

397
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:13,086
I'm-I'm sorry. Mr. Casperberg...

398
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,092
this script is brilliant.

399
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,459
But we're a glee club, and we should perform.

400
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,431
Perform the lines as I wrote them.

401
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,766
<i>Wait a minute, Dennis.
What did you have in mind?</i>

402
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:33,340
<i>¶¶ Ba, ba, ba, ba-ba
ba-da, ba, ba-da, da ¶¶</i>

403
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:40,443
- Ahhhh!
- ¶¶ Ba, ba, ba, ba-ba, ba-da, ba, ba-da, da ¶¶

404
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:43,454
<i>- ¶¶ I get up ¶¶
- ¶¶ Ba, ba, ba, ba ¶¶</i>

405
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:47,014
<i>¶¶ And nothing gets me down ¶¶</i>

406
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,788
¶¶ You got it tough ¶¶

407
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:54,798
<i>¶¶ I've seen the toughest around ¶¶</i>

408
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,697
¶¶ And I know ¶¶

409
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,865
¶¶ Baby, just how you feel ¶¶

410
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,504
¶¶ You've got to roll with the punches ¶¶

411
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:08,842
¶¶ To get to what's real ¶¶

412
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:11,912
¶¶ Oh, can't you see me standing here ¶¶

413
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:15,976
<i>¶¶ I got my back against the record machine ¶¶</i>

414
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:18,022
¶¶ I ain't the worst that you seen ¶¶

415
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:19,716
¶¶ Ain't the worst that you seen ¶¶

416
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,089
<i>¶¶ Oh, can't you see what I mean ¶¶</i>

417
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,890
¶¶ Can't you see what I mean ¶¶

418
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,557
- ¶¶ Yeah, yeah, yeah ¶¶
- ¶¶ Might as well jump ¶¶

419
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,497
<i>- ¶¶ Jump ¶¶
- Ba, ba, ba, ba-da, da ¶¶</i>

420
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:34,096
- ¶¶ Might as well jump ¶¶
- ¶¶ Ba, ba, ba, ba-da, da ¶¶

421
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:35,867
- ¶¶ Go ahead and jump ¶¶
- ¶¶ Jump ¶¶

422
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:39,672
- ¶¶ Ba, ba, ba, ba-da, da ¶¶
- ¶¶ Go ahead and jump ¶¶

423
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:46,013
- ¶¶ Ba, ba-da, da, jump ¶¶
- ¶¶ Yeah ¶¶

424
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,381
- ¶¶ Ba ¶¶
- ¶¶ Ba ¶¶

425
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:48,919
- ¶¶ Ba ¶¶

00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,387

427
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,947

00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:05,429

00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,080
¶¶ Jump ¶¶¶¶

436
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:19,616
Come on down to Mattress Land!

437
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,744
Come on down to Mattress Land!

438
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:33,993
Terri, have you seen my pocket square?

439
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:39,667
Terri?

440
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:16,437
- Terri.
- A pocket square's gonna
make you look like Ted Knight.

441
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,002
What is this?

442
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:24,007
It's a pregnancy pad.

443
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,678
They have them at the maternity stores
for trying on clothes...

444
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,845
so you can see how you're gonna look
when you're showing.

445
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:33,687
Kendra stole it for me so I can see
if any of her old clothes would fit...

446
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:37,995
Pick up your shirt.

447
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:40,998
What? No.

448
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:45,868
- Pick up your shirt.
- You're scaring me, Will.

449
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:50,536
Now, think about what you're accusing me of.

450
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:55,239
Think about it and turn around
and go find your pocket square.

451
00:26:57,482 --> 00:26:59,677
Please.

452
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:13,990
Why did you do this to us? I don't understand.

453
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:16,158
<i>I thought you were leaving me.</i>

454
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:19,863
You're so different, Will. We both know it.
I can feel you. You're pulling away from me.

455
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:23,499
Because I've started standing up to you,
trying to make this a relationship of equals?

456
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,600
No, because of the damn Glee Club.

457
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:29,238
<i>Ever since you started it,
you just walk around like you're better than me.</i>

458
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,942
I should be allowed
to feel good about myself.

459
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:37,614
Who are we kidding, Will? This marriage works
because you don't feel good about yourself.

460
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:40,715
This marriage works because I love you...

461
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:43,352
<i>- because I've always accepted you.
- No.</i>

462
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:47,956
- Good and bad.
- You love the girl you met when you were 15.

463
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:51,901
- I'm not that girl.
- You've made yourself a stranger to me now.

464
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,370
- No.
- Are you happy? Are you satisfied?

465
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,669
It didn't start as a lie.

466
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:59,209
I really thought I was pregnant.

467
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:02,769
And then the doctor,
he said it was a hysterical pregnancy...

468
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,077
and I just panicked.

469
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,349
This is insane.

470
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:14,051
I mean, wh-what were you gonna do
when the due date came?

471
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,928
Quinn Fabray.

472
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:21,598
<i>It was so perfect.</i>

473
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,226
<i>She didn't want hers, and I needed one.</i>

474
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:28,068
I had the doctor use her ultrasound DVD...

475
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:30,164
at your appointment that you came to.

476
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,637
I loved you, Terri.

477
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:39,917
- I really loved you.
- I'm so sorry, Will.

478
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:41,975
I'm so sorry.

479
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:45,420
Do you remember that appointment?
Do you remember what we said?

480
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,617
That at that moment, no matter
what happened, we loved each other.

481
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:51,321
We can get that feeling back again.
You can love me back, Will.

482
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,523
Please, Will. Please don't go.

483
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:55,691
Please don't go! Please!

484
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:05,075
Oh, God.

485
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,350
<i>Am I asking for too much...</i>

486
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:24,582
Ohio Board of Statewide Holiday Planning?

487
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,783
All I want is just one day a year...

488
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:30,658
where I'm not visually assaulted
by uglies and fatties.

489
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:33,458
Seriously, Ohio,
these retinas need a day off.

490
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:37,262
So here's the dream.
Friday after Christmas, which I have off...

491
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,326
if you're hideous, stay at home.

492
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,395
Spend the entire day watching home videos...

493
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:44,566
of a time when you weren't too repulsive
for me to ever wanna look at.

494
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:47,304
At that's how Sue sees it.

495
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:51,678
- Rod.
- Slammin' , Sue.

496
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:54,081
We'll be right back.

497
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:57,519
<i>Hey, Andrea,
that "Sue's Corner"I just did...</i>

498
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,955
I was talking about you.

499
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,457
<i>¶¶ Go ahead and jump ¶¶</i>

500
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,460
Who says finding a mattress can't be fun?

501
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,258
At Mattress Land,
we have mattresses of all shapes and sizes...

502
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:08,629
at prices that won't break your pocketbook.

503
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,634
No credit? No problem.

504
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:14,263
Mattress Land
has a no-hassle financing of 12.9%...

505
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:17,172
with no money down
and no payments till next year.

506
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,301
You'll jump for joy at our prices.

507
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,675
Come on down to Mattress Land!

508
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:25,443
Coach Sylvester, we need to talk.

509
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:27,916
Oh, I got nothing to say to you, preggo.

510
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:31,012
The Cheerios photo's tomorrow,
and I want back on that squad.

511
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:34,616
Oh, is that what you want?
Well, what I wanted was a head cheerleader...

512
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:36,683
who wasn't going to hoist
her legs behind her ears...

513
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:39,787
in the back seat of the first station wagon
she could jimmy open...

514
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:41,923
throwing away any chance
she ever had in life.

515
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,991
It would be good for the school...

516
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,400
show everyone
that appearances don't matter.

517
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:49,269
Sometimes people have to deal
with a little adversity.

518
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,274
I learned that in Glee Club.

519
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:53,276
Well, that little educational proverb...

520
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,437
must have slithered
from Will Schuester's mouth...

521
00:31:55,513 --> 00:32:00,143
right after his lesson on how
to disqualify yourselves from sectionals.

522
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:03,619
- What?
- Saw your little commercial last night.

523
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:06,248
Boy, did you Glee kids step in it.

524
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,418
Schue, I'm afraid Sue is right.

525
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,486
You have indeed stepped in it.

526
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:15,031
- I didn't even know this was going on.
- Of course you didn't, William.

527
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,090
You wouldn't know if your Glee Club
was using your office...

528
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:19,159
to breed rabbits for pets or for food.

529
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,228
You know why?
You're too busy chasing tail...

530
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:23,968
and loading your hair
with enormous amounts of product.

531
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,010
Today it just looks like you put lard in it.

532
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:28,307
What are you even talking about?

533
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:32,145
Look... Look, the kids did the commercial
to foster a feeling of unity...

534
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:35,811
after you... not anyone else...
you got them banned from the yearbook.

535
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:38,151
- That's what I did, yes.
- It was an innocent mistake.

536
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:40,884
And what if I were to just
innocently murder you, Will?

537
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,927
<i>I'd still have to go to trial.</i>

538
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:44,791
Probably get off with justifiable homicide.

539
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:47,057
Let me review the rules for you.

540
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,430
- This is crazy.
- Amendment 63, seventh addendum.

541
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:52,992
"No professional activity
of any kind will be tolerated...

542
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:56,438
"and payment for services rendered
negates amateur status...

543
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:59,067
- triggering immediate disqualification."
- Hey. Hey.

544
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:03,079
- Hey, hey, hey. Keep it civil. Keep it simple.
- Hey what, mister?

545
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:06,605
Keep it simple. Hey, I am sorry, Schue,
but I cannot let this slide.

546
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,618
But the kids weren't even paid.

547
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:10,677
There's a stack of mattresses
in the choir room...

548
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:13,121
piled as high as the empty hair gel bottles...

549
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:16,388
- in the Dumpster outside your apartment.
- We'll give the mattresses back.

550
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,554
<i>Schue, one of those mattresses was used.</i>

551
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,597
You can't return a used mattress.

552
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,724
<i>You can't even donate one to charity.</i>

553
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,268
Lice. Bedbugs. I looked it up online.

554
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:28,271
Is there any reason that you have
a soiled mattress in your office, Will?

555
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,603
Have you and the redhead
become so sexually depraved...

556
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:34,702
that you have to commit your craven acts
of adultery in between classes?

557
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:37,714
- Wha...
- I slept... You know, okay, fine.

558
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,750
I slept here, all right?

559
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:42,445
Excuse me?

560
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:48,892
I'm thinking about leaving my wife.

561
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,053
Oh, I didn't see that one coming at all.

562
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:55,793
William, I am very sorry about
your personal troubles, but my hands are tied.

563
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,960
Sue's right. You broke the rules.

564
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:01,062
<i>I cannot fight the scholastic board.</i>

565
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,630
I'm sorry, but Glee Club is over.

566
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:08,476
It's over.

567
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,325
<i>Dear Journal...</i>

568
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:27,592
I've finally gotten Will Schuester
and that Glee Club out of my hair.

569
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:31,328
This is a day that will live in infamy.

570
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,929
<i>Once again, I've won.</i>

571
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:38,465
Miss Sylvester.

572
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,206
It's like looking at a porno star
in a nun's habit.

573
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:48,116
I wanted to show you that it still fits.

574
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:51,622
My baby bump isn't that bad.
It's just like I had a big lunch.

575
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:54,886
Take it off. You need to get it
through your pregnant head...

576
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:58,986
there's no way you're getting in that photo
or back on the Cheerios... end of story.

577
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:01,691
- You're a hypocrite.
- Excuse me?

578
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:05,463
I just heard that you got Glee Club's
amateur status revoked over a mattress...

579
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:08,869
while you are constantly showering
the Cheerios with swag.

580
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,706
I've gotten free shoes,
complimentary tanning, haircuts.

581
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:16,178
The season tickets to Cedar Point?
We sold those on eBay.

582
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:17,839
For a profit.

583
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:20,247
It seems to me that if Figgins found out...

584
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:22,548
you would get banned from competition.

585
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:26,222
Fine. You're back on the Cheerios.

586
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,485
I'll put you on full-time dry-cleaning duty...

587
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,754
and shove you to the back of the photo
to hide your shame.

588
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:35,231
I'm not finished.
Glee Club gets a full-page photo.

589
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:38,166
- It's not up to me.
- You are giving up...

590
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:41,228
one of the Cheerios' six pages...

591
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:45,264
and you are giving it to the Glee Club
free of charge.

592
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:49,536
You know, Q. I'd forgotten...

593
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:53,846
just how ruthless you really are.

594
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:55,715
You're like a young Sue Sylvester.

595
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:58,277
Now get out of my office...

596
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:00,722
if you can manage to squeeze through the door
without your water breaking...

597
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,452
all over my new carpet.

598
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,757
You know what?

599
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,821
I don't think I wanna be a Cheerio after all.

600
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,993
I don't wanna be on a team
where I only appear to belong.

601
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:13,901
I'd rather be a part of a club
that's proud to have me...

602
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:16,235
like Glee Club.

603
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:24,214
It's my fault.

604
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,147
If I hadn't slept on that mattress...

605
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,151
we could have just
returned them and moved on.

606
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:31,586
- Hey, can I give you some advice?
- Please.

607
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:33,920
You need to give yourself a break.

608
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:35,891
You do. You'll...

609
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,087
You'll figure out what to do with the kids.
You always do.

610
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:42,428
But I think right now
you really need to focus on your own life.

611
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,060
You know, divorce is a really big deal.

612
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,005
Who said anything about getting a divorce?

613
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:55,610
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
I just assumed that that's...

614
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,444
Is that what you would do?

615
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:00,507
Well, um...

616
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:05,745
When I first heard
about what Terri had done...

617
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:07,814
I thought there should be some sort of law.

618
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:11,487
<i>But then when I thought about it some more...</i>

619
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,759
I thought about what I would have done...

620
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:16,959
if I'd felt you slipping away.

621
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:19,127
You would never be that cruel.

622
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:21,763
You know, her methods were wrong.

623
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,535
But, um...

624
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:27,271
I totally understand her intentions.

625
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:33,844
You're a lot to lose, Will.

626
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,816
But we don't wanna go
to sectionals without you.

627
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:43,485
It's without me or not at all.

628
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:47,325
Look, I was the one
who slept on the mattress...

629
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:50,731
which means I accepted them, not you.

630
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:54,800
Which means I'm disqualified
from competition.

631
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:57,898
- Not you guys.
- He's taking the bullet for us.

632
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:00,000
<i>Solid.</i>

633
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:05,982
We have worked too hard
for you guys not to get your shot.

634
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,416
We can't do this without you, Mr. Schue.

635
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:11,148
- Hell, we probably can't do it with you.
- That's not true.

636
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:14,350
You guys are good.

637
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:17,550
You're really good.

638
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:21,587
Y-Y-You did "Jump"
for that commercial without me, right?

639
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,925
Look...

640
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:28,836
the best teachers
don't give you the answers.

641
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:34,310
They just point the way
and let you make your own choices...

642
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:36,369
your own mistakes.

643
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:41,841
That way, you get all the glory.

644
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,648
And you deserve it.

645
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:49,181
But if...

646
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,058
if you can't win without me there...

647
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:54,689
then I haven't done my job.

648
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:58,962
We're really sorry, Mr. Schue.

649
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:01,004
