1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,156
Uncle, you have the blueprints
of the hospital, right?

2
00:00:06,202 --> 00:00:07,726
Must be on my table.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:09,394
Search it.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,598
Oh, boy.

5
00:00:13,909 --> 00:00:14,876
What happened?

6
00:00:15,711 --> 00:00:19,340
How can you keep such
confidential papers like this?

7
00:00:22,218 --> 00:00:25,745
How many times have I told you...
I need an assistant...

8
00:00:40,903 --> 00:00:44,100
Heritage Hotel project. Our home?

9
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,775
Our home... a hotel?

10
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:01,719
See what Lolita's got me
with her first pay?

11
00:01:02,258 --> 00:01:03,725
Chocolate. For me?

12
00:01:03,926 --> 00:01:06,121
Can't you ever buy
something for yourself?

13
00:01:09,431 --> 00:01:12,992
Silly girl.
- What if uncle finds out?

14
00:01:14,436 --> 00:01:15,733
What are you looking at?

15
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:29,581
How much time do we
have to vacate?

16
00:01:29,858 --> 00:01:34,989
End of November, I think.

17
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:38,256
This can't happen.

18
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,600
Navin uncle can't do this.

19
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:47,004
A profitless deal is a bad one.

20
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:50,170
I have to repay by 30th November.

21
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,847
Can I ever repay?

22
00:02:03,925 --> 00:02:06,120
Tell me what do you want?

23
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:09,928
I could ask Shekhar...

24
00:02:10,098 --> 00:02:14,194
but will he have 150,000...?

25
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:15,960
Here, keep the key.

26
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,456
Didn't you hear the horn?

27
00:02:43,932 --> 00:02:48,062
I'll drop you if you're
on your way home.

28
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,240
A profit less deal is a bad one.

29
00:02:58,112 --> 00:03:03,744
Navin Rai though a gentleman
is also a businessman.

30
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,593
Oh, hello. - Hello.

31
00:03:13,795 --> 00:03:16,764
Did you meet him on
the way, Lolita?

32
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:21,260
Where have you been all
these days, Gurucharan?

33
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,939
I wanted to show you
my face only after...

34
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:30,266
...l'd organized at least
part of your money.

35
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:34,273
Money isn't going to disappear
all of a sudden, are they?

36
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:36,446
Return at your leisure.

37
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:39,510
Ridiculous. I'm your neighbour,
not a businessman.

38
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:44,049
You've retired now, relax.

39
00:03:45,994 --> 00:03:49,953
Stop worrying.
We'll find some way.

40
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:51,859
Let's go, uncle.

41
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,626
Goodbye.

42
00:03:53,835 --> 00:03:54,529
Let's go.

43
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,205
He's taken a load off me.

44
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,478
Let's all celebrate with your
aunt's spinach cutlets.

45
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:10,311
I know you love them.
I'm going to eat so much.

46
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:12,410
Raghu.

47
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:23,227
Anything else?

48
00:04:23,698 --> 00:04:31,104
Just one, sir, where will Lolita and
her family go after eviction?

49
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:39,336
I mean, everything is ready
from our end... we're ready.

50
00:04:41,049 --> 00:04:42,846
We're getting a house worth...

51
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:44,518
...two million for just 150,000...

52
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:49,849
...surely we can give them
10 or 20,000 as good will.

53
00:04:50,058 --> 00:04:50,786
Yes, sir.

54
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:54,786
We won't throw them out.
They can stay in our old warehouse.

55
00:04:55,063 --> 00:04:57,861
But that place...?

56
00:04:58,066 --> 00:05:03,197
Get it cleaned, get some electricity...
they can stay...

57
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:04,701
...there for a few days.

58
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:09,031
In any case, their house is
too classy for them.

59
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:15,546
True. But won't Shekhar's presence...?

60
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,377
Don't worry.

61
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:23,551
Shekhar will be in Darjeeling
finalizing the Tea Estate deal.

62
00:05:23,758 --> 00:05:27,285
At least you can sleep peacefully now.

63
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:30,564
Otherwise we kept getting visitors.

64
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:35,065
But the debt still exists, and
we still have to pay it back.

65
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:42,842
Now you've started.
Hasn't Navin Rai just said...

66
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:46,641
Words don't mean anything.
We must repay him.

67
00:05:47,115 --> 00:05:49,982
Who has that kind of money?

68
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:57,418
I have some money... and
we can sell mother's jewelery.

69
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:06,093
What? Sell sister's jewelery?
What's the matter with you?

70
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:15,332
How do I explain to you
that unless we repay him...

71
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:19,606
Don't worry daughter.
Please don't cry.

72
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:22,282
Have some faith in Navin Rai.

73
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:24,007
Hello, uncle. Hello, aunty.

74
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:25,285
Hello, Sunita.

75
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:27,784
Have a sweet. Charu's engaged.

76
00:06:27,989 --> 00:06:28,887
Is it?

77
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:31,689
Why the long face?

78
00:06:31,993 --> 00:06:33,517
You've to make
the arrangements, right?

79
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:35,352
Come on, we have to
select saris for the wedding.

80
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:36,791
When is it?

81
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:38,966
After the festival... on the 19th.

82
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:40,634
So soon?

83
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:43,303
I know. But the priest says
it's a very auspicious day.

84
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:44,630
Just need to exchange garlands...

85
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,807
You can't call that a wedding?

86
00:06:47,008 --> 00:06:50,967
Exactly. It's such an auspicious day
that, that's all you need.

87
00:06:51,179 --> 00:06:54,637
No, our Charu will go
amid a lot of fanfare.

88
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:55,645
Absolutely.

89
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,249
Let's go.

90
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:58,985
No, I have to go to Shekhar's.

91
00:06:59,187 --> 00:07:04,648
I've just come from there...
he's out. Go later.

92
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:07,657
Go, it'll brighten your mood.

93
00:07:07,862 --> 00:07:09,489
Guess what... yesterday Girish
was to come...

94
00:07:09,697 --> 00:07:10,322
...shopping with me

95
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:11,498
...He didn't come with me...

96
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:12,996
and he never listens to me.

97
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:15,498
One second... - Yes.

98
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:18,263
Is Shekhar back? - Not yet.

99
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:21,007
Please let me know once he does.

100
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:22,005
OK.

101
00:07:23,044 --> 00:07:26,013
Enter only if you're in peace.

102
00:07:26,214 --> 00:07:28,774
Has the fuse blown again?

103
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:30,007
Let me show you the sari
I've picked out...

104
00:07:30,218 --> 00:07:32,413
Here comes the ghost. I'm off.

105
00:07:35,056 --> 00:07:36,683
There's a wedding to organize

106
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:38,358
and you're sitting
with the planchette.

107
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:39,589
Please sit, sis.

108
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:41,695
Ask something, sis.

109
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:43,693
The spirit's here already?

110
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:47,629
Ask something, sis? Come on...

111
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:55,439
I've asked.

112
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,040
And here's your answer...

113
00:08:00,248 --> 00:08:15,721
P-R-O-B-L-E-M-S-O-L-V-E-D

114
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:21,562
Sis, consider your problem solved.
What's the problem?

115
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:22,895
Sis...?

116
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:26,800
What's up? - Nothing.

117
00:08:30,278 --> 00:08:35,238
Now lets see who will solve it?

118
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:43,415
Girish.

119
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:44,249
Girish? - Girish?

120
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:50,419
Brother, you'll solve her...
yes, with a magnet.

121
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,758
What's this, Girish?
- Cheating. No...

122
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:54,832
I hate such pranks.

123
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:58,597
Lolita, Shekhar's back.

124
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,937
I have to go.

125
00:09:05,313 --> 00:09:07,110
Who's this Shekhar?

126
00:09:07,315 --> 00:09:08,782
How come you're here tonight?

127
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:10,443
Shekhar, please.

128
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:12,380
What happened?

129
00:09:14,155 --> 00:09:15,622
I need some money.

130
00:09:16,324 --> 00:09:18,792
Why ask? You have the key.

131
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:23,964
I need a bit more.

132
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:25,632
How much?

133
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:28,969
150,000 rupees.

134
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:34,805
What? Are you buying a plane?
Direct to London, huh?

135
00:09:35,343 --> 00:09:41,976
Please stop joking.
I really need that much.

136
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:53,888
Why? What happened?

137
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:54,754
Shekhar... I...

138
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:01,558
Shekhar. - Yes, father.

139
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:07,838
Sidharth's coming here to
discuss your Darjeeling trip.

140
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:09,168
Come to the study.

141
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,108
Now.

142
00:10:26,394 --> 00:10:31,422
They will lose their ancestral home
worth two million for

143
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:32,997
just 150,000?

144
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:36,529
If I could I'd give it to them
and ask them to fling

145
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:38,364
it on Navin Rai's face.

146
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:40,199
I have that much. - What?

147
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:44,040
I can give them the money.
- But why?

148
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:51,481
Sis, its just 11,252 pounds.

149
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:56,382
While we celebrate
Charu's wedding.

150
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:00,048
Imagine them on the streets

151
00:11:00,428 --> 00:11:03,397
True. If you can,

152
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:05,895
please do something.
God will bless you.

153
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,158
I will.

154
00:11:07,435 --> 00:11:16,901
But is that the only reason,
or... Lolita. Aha. Lolita.

155
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:20,239
Sis, can't you take anything
at face value?

156
00:11:20,448 --> 00:11:25,750
Have you seen yours
it's bright red.

157
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,247
You're too much, sis.

158
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:38,595
I can't believe this, son.

159
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:41,927
Girish is making me...

160
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:45,333
...his Managing Partner
in his new project.

161
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,197
Managing Partner? - Yes.

162
00:11:47,475 --> 00:11:52,936
And, he's given me five years'
pay in advance too.

163
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:55,775
180,000 rupees...

164
00:11:58,486 --> 00:12:00,113
with no interest.

165
00:12:00,488 --> 00:12:07,621
Uncle, it's your salary,
not a debt.

166
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:11,286
But son, at this age...? - What?

167
00:12:11,499 --> 00:12:13,626
I'm a textile man...

168
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:17,964
You're a man of principles, uncle.

169
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:23,033
I need your values and experience.

170
00:12:24,512 --> 00:12:25,979
Hear that?

171
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:30,377
OK, son. I'll accept this.

172
00:12:31,352 --> 00:12:33,650
Our problems have disappeared.

173
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:36,486
Though Navin Rai is a gentleman...

174
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:42,253
Even so... a debt should be
repaid as fast as possible.

175
00:12:42,363 --> 00:12:47,995
You're right, son.
I'll keep this inside.

176
00:13:13,561 --> 00:13:20,524
Oh, no. No tears now.
Let's celebrate. Get dressed now.

177
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:21,530
Why?

178
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:23,961
Girish, haven't you told her?

179
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:28,364
Yeah, it's a double celebration
at Trinca's...

180
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:33,570
For Charu's wedding and...
do you have a headache today?

181
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:41,317
Come on get dressed now.
And sis, wear my heels if you like.

182
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:43,552
I'm fine in these flats.
I'm not going to fall.

183
00:13:44,592 --> 00:13:45,718
Hurry up.

184
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:50,055
How will we all fit?

185
00:13:50,264 --> 00:13:52,061
In a big heart.

186
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:55,000
Come on.

187
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:59,735
And Keol, try not to
mess up my shirt today.

188
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,899
What is this riddle called life?

189
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:12,041
Can you block it, can you
stop that which flows?

190
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:48,379
Good Morning.

191
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:53,282
Good morning. How's everything?

192
00:14:53,494 --> 00:14:54,961
Your money.

193
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:58,624
Money?

194
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:01,733
The mortgage... exactly 150,000 rupees.

195
00:15:03,671 --> 00:15:05,639
How did you get so much money?

196
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,864
Met a gentlemen just like you.

197
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:09,633
Impossible.

198
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:12,145
Did you get burnt?

199
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:17,806
You can't mortgage an
already mortgaged house.

200
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:23,820
It's not like that.
Girish... oh, you don't know him.

201
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:27,824
He's made me his Managing Partner.

202
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:32,154
Thought the least I can do
is repay your money as

203
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:33,663
I can never repay your kindness.

204
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:35,767
Please take it.

205
00:15:43,544 --> 00:15:47,571
Just need your signature here.

206
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:03,124
Now if I could just have
my house papers please...

207
00:16:15,743 --> 00:16:18,712
Hello, uncle. - Hello, son.
Meeting with dad?

208
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:21,938
Yes. The Goddess has
been very kind.

209
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:25,177
I've repaid my entire debt,
with interest.

210
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,387
Really?

211
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:30,549
The Goddess sent him from
London just to help us.

212
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:37,959
Imagine, 180,000 rupees.
See you, son.

213
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:40,491
Do come in the evening
for the prayers.

214
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:05,481
Hey, what are you doing?

215
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,817
Might burn your feet.

216
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:40,509
Come on, aunt... the clothes are
yours, so are the earrings...

217
00:18:40,721 --> 00:18:42,416
...and now this necklace - why?

218
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:47,857
You're mine too, aren't you?

219
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:57,531
Stay away from the evil eye today...
you look beautiful.

220
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:10,316
I hope you marry a prince,
and rule where ever you go.

221
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:15,045
Let's go.
Sunita has called five times.

222
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:17,723
Now go.
Get my prince ready.

223
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:19,319
Why?

224
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,992
He's sulking.
Just like his father.

225
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:26,391
Says he's lost his buttons and chain.

226
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,898
You mean his sense of humour.

227
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:33,330
Get him ready quickly.
Just fifteen minutes left. - OK.

228
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:42,142
Just fifteen minutes left
and you're not ready yet?

229
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:46,176
Now smoke your health away.

230
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:48,820
I know what's good for me.

231
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:58,590
Why the temper? Brilliant excuse not to
show up though can't find my
buttons and chain.' So what's this?

232
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:01,122
I don't want to go.

233
00:20:01,969 --> 00:20:03,231
Why?

234
00:20:03,437 --> 00:20:04,495
Is this a marriage?

235
00:20:04,972 --> 00:20:08,772
No conversation, no engagement
just a cold wedding invitation.

236
00:20:08,976 --> 00:20:09,704
I'm not in the mood.

237
00:20:11,111 --> 00:20:13,705
Weddings are dictated by an
auspicious moment... not your mood.

238
00:20:13,914 --> 00:20:17,645
And they say tonight
is particularly auspicious.

239
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:20,411
Exchange garlands, and you're married.

240
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:23,315
I said I'm not going.

241
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:24,581
What's up with you?

242
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,225
No - what's up with all of you?

243
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:28,792
What do you mean?

244
00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:31,726
You, uncle...

245
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:37,170
Why did you take money
from that stranger?

246
00:20:37,371 --> 00:20:38,929
Did father ever ask for the money?

247
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:42,470
Do you know why Girish helped you?

248
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:44,207
Tell me.

249
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:46,637
To buy you.

250
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,743
Moulin Rouge, bailing you
out with money...

251
00:20:48,949 --> 00:20:50,177
I could've helped you.

252
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:51,180
And I did ask you.

253
00:20:51,385 --> 00:20:55,219
But you didn't wait.
Why did you go to him?

254
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:56,821
Where would you have
got that money from?

255
00:20:57,024 --> 00:21:00,152
Why don't you understand?
I could've asked father.

256
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:04,620
And have us repay your father
with his own money?

257
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:13,602
Do you even know what he...
anyway. Thank God, it's over.

258
00:21:14,141 --> 00:21:14,903
What's over?

259
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:24,215
Nothing. And...
I didn't go to Moulin Rouge.

260
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:26,343
Why?

261
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:30,351
You didn't want me to.

262
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:35,258
When did I stop you?

263
00:21:38,532 --> 00:21:48,032
You were livid... kept scolding me.
Have I ever gone anywhere
without asking you?

264
00:21:49,176 --> 00:21:51,235
You're always yelling at me...

265
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:58,984
Uncle and Girish made the deal,
how is it my fault?

266
00:22:00,721 --> 00:22:02,348
I'm sorry.

267
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:11,255
Everyone went except me.
I'll never go.

268
00:22:12,733 --> 00:22:13,563
I'm sorry.

269
00:22:15,235 --> 00:22:16,759
You can have your buttons. And this...

270
00:22:27,114 --> 00:22:28,445
What have you done?

271
00:22:30,884 --> 00:22:32,317
Now what?

272
00:22:35,122 --> 00:22:37,818
Do you know what this means tonight?

273
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:41,786
It's not a garland... it's...

274
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:58,201
Shekhar, please stop joking.

275
00:22:58,478 --> 00:23:04,110
I'm not joking. You know how
auspicious tonight is, right?

276
00:23:08,522 --> 00:23:13,391
Let me complete the ritual.

277
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:30,933
And with this exchange of garlands
you two are now man and wife.

278
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:38,173
Your lips intoxicate me...

279
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:46,110
...I drown in the kohl of your eyes.

280
00:24:48,088 --> 00:24:54,994
Dewy morning glides your forehead...

281
00:24:57,163 --> 00:25:03,727
...night resides in your tresses.

282
00:25:06,106 --> 00:25:10,304
Every breath I draw for you...

283
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:15,446
...for you flutters my heart.

284
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:21,649
My life itself you win from me,
I lose, and I lose joyously.

285
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:26,852
When you touch me...

286
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,018
my body and heart feel adorned.

287
00:25:32,165 --> 00:25:36,431
I became a married woman.

288
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:40,263
My heart sways gently,

289
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:44,108
ever so slow...

290
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:48,105
...but why it sways,

291
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:50,106
I do not know.

292
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:16,532
Repeat after me...

293
00:26:30,557 --> 00:26:32,047
Where were you, sis?

294
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:34,419
Right here... inside.

295
00:26:34,861 --> 00:26:35,919
She looks so pretty.

296
00:26:36,863 --> 00:26:43,200
Bring the warm bread, quick.
May I serve you some?

297
00:26:44,371 --> 00:26:47,829
Isn't Shekhar looking handsome today?

298
00:26:51,311 --> 00:26:55,008
Girish, don't serve it cold.
Get some warm bread, man.

299
00:26:55,215 --> 00:26:58,776
They know each other?
- No idea.

300
00:26:58,985 --> 00:27:03,183
Cold bread is no bread.
This isn't your English bread, brother.

301
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,989
So what took you so long
to get here o' patriot?

302
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:09,024
I was at another wedding.

303
00:27:10,397 --> 00:27:13,161
Should've told them it was
as important to come here.

304
00:27:13,366 --> 00:27:16,267
But that wedding was
not possible without me.

305
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:28,876
Girish, let me serve father.

306
00:27:31,184 --> 00:27:34,210
You're looking really dashing today.

307
00:27:35,955 --> 00:27:38,423
Supervise the kitchen you two.

308
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:50,902
Look at Lolita... she is looking
like a bride today.

309
00:27:52,272 --> 00:27:53,967
Shekhar's train leaves
at seven in the morning.

310
00:27:54,441 --> 00:27:57,035
Make sure his bags are packed.

311
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:07,084
See you.

312
00:28:08,288 --> 00:28:10,017
Take care of everyone
at home. - I will.

313
00:28:10,223 --> 00:28:13,818
Mother and... yes... Lolita too.

314
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:16,086
Yes, yes. You take care, son.

315
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,550
I'll put you in jail.

316
00:28:49,629 --> 00:28:50,596
Sir...

317
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:56,223
Isn't 150,000 rupees a lot for you?
- Sir?

318
00:28:56,703 --> 00:28:59,968
Don't you think Girish overpaid
for a girl my son

319
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:03,472
bought with his pocket money?

320
00:29:03,676 --> 00:29:05,337
Sir, please stop.

321
00:29:05,545 --> 00:29:10,312
Oh. I'm not allowed?
So, what is permitted?

322
00:29:10,517 --> 00:29:14,954
Shekhar buying you every day?

323
00:29:15,155 --> 00:29:20,650
Or Girish, making you his life-long
mistress in one clean swoop?

324
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,728
You're crossing the line, sir.
I am going...

325
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:29,834
Is that a warning?
Mocking me with Girish's money?

326
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:34,167
There's a word for women
who sell themselves for money.

327
00:29:34,374 --> 00:29:39,243
Don't know what you call them,
but respectable people like...

328
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:42,505
...us call them prostitutes.

329
00:29:43,716 --> 00:29:45,115
Now just get out of here.

330
00:29:45,485 --> 00:29:48,249
I don't want to see you or
your family's faces ever again.

331
00:29:48,855 --> 00:29:50,083
...you bloody whore.

332
00:29:54,327 --> 00:29:56,158
Why do I keep remembering
you so much?

333
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:05,160
That I jump off the train?
Hey, not possible.

334
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:12,404
O' the joys of a train ride,

335
00:30:12,612 --> 00:30:15,376
go up and down this hillside.

336
00:30:15,582 --> 00:30:16,810
You know what they are saying?

337
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:21,513
Life is like a roller coaster ride.
What do you say?

338
00:30:21,588 --> 00:30:24,216
I'm talking to you and
you're not even here.

339
00:30:24,624 --> 00:30:28,219
I can hear the winds murmur,

340
00:30:28,428 --> 00:30:31,829
they wonder where you are.

341
00:30:32,065 --> 00:30:35,466
I see you in the blossoms,
I see you in the streams...

342
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:39,695
...I see you in the cobbled
lanes of my dreams.

343
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:43,703
I can hear the winds murmur,

344
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:47,141
They wonder where you are.

345
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:51,146
I see you in the blossoms,
I see you in the streams,

346
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:55,378
I see you in the cobbled
lanes of my dreams.

347
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:13,328
The earth looks charming
the skies don their best...

348
00:31:14,674 --> 00:31:24,549
...I see our home nestled
among their breast.

349
00:31:25,585 --> 00:31:33,048
But with you so far,
this dream is lonely...

350
00:31:33,326 --> 00:31:39,595
...come to me now,
you're my one and only.

351
00:31:41,668 --> 00:31:45,399
O' the joys of a train ride,

352
00:31:45,605 --> 00:31:49,405
go up and down this hillside.

353
00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:53,045
I can hear the winds murmur,

354
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,979
they wonder where you are.

355
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:00,811
I see you in the blossoms,
I see you in the streams...

356
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:05,150
...I see you in the cobbled
lanes of my dreams.

357
00:32:14,701 --> 00:32:17,727
Can you hear my soul chant,

358
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:24,706
Live always in my heart.

359
00:32:26,045 --> 00:32:29,412
You're my bliss, you're my pain;

360
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:36,350
You're the summer in my rain.

361
00:32:37,223 --> 00:32:40,954
Through the trail of our dreams,

362
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,789
bringing caravans of bliss...

363
00:32:44,997 --> 00:32:51,368
...come to me, my darling,
come to me again.

364
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:56,933
O' the joys of a train ride,

365
00:32:57,176 --> 00:33:00,805
go up and down this hillside.

366
00:33:01,047 --> 00:33:04,778
O' the joys of a train ride,

367
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:08,784
go up and down this hillside.

368
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:12,885
I can hear the winds murmur,

369
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:16,584
they wonder where you are.

370
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:43,845
Hello, sir.

371
00:33:44,056 --> 00:33:45,648
Hello. Is Sidharth here?

372
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:48,418
He's waiting for you at
the tea estate. - Good.

373
00:33:48,628 --> 00:33:49,925
You've been booked at the hotel.

374
00:33:50,129 --> 00:33:52,120
But I'm leaving this evening.

375
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:53,263
Today?

376
00:33:55,735 --> 00:33:58,101
Give me a call tomorrow.

377
00:33:58,838 --> 00:33:59,930
Surprise.

378
00:34:02,074 --> 00:34:03,769
Aren't you just thrilled to see me?

379
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:14,776
Hey, what are you doing?

380
00:34:14,987 --> 00:34:18,184
Why is this wall being built?

381
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:23,520
Why you are cutting our tree?
And this wall?

382
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,253
I don't want to see their faces.

383
00:34:25,465 --> 00:34:28,263
Hey, why are you cutting our tree?

384
00:34:28,468 --> 00:34:30,402
Uncle, please calm down. - Why?

385
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,568
Koel, take him inside.

386
00:34:31,771 --> 00:34:34,399
This girl has ruined everything.

387
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:36,664
What's happening to father?

388
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:38,666
Father. - Uncle?

389
00:34:39,512 --> 00:34:45,644
Father. - Uncle?

390
00:34:46,853 --> 00:34:47,649
Good work, Shekhar.

391
00:34:47,854 --> 00:34:49,879
I'll just complete the formalities
and be with you.

392
00:34:51,023 --> 00:34:53,321
I think today is a good day for me.

393
00:34:53,526 --> 00:34:58,486
Great. Now I'm tired. Work ends.
Party begins.

394
00:34:58,698 --> 00:35:00,598
Let's go back to the
hotel and celebrate.

395
00:35:00,967 --> 00:35:03,663
I'm afraid I have to
return this evening.

396
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:04,564
What?

397
00:35:05,004 --> 00:35:08,531
Have a recording tomorrow with
fifty violinists... - Are you sure?

398
00:35:08,975 --> 00:35:10,966
Of course. Would I lie to you?

399
00:35:11,177 --> 00:35:13,008
I'm going to check on you.

400
00:35:14,347 --> 00:35:16,178
Please call home and

401
00:35:16,382 --> 00:35:18,350
ask them to send a car
to the station.

402
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:21,844
You don't worry about that.
Just make great music.

403
00:35:22,054 --> 00:35:23,282
I love music.

404
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:26,250
Bye.

405
00:35:32,064 --> 00:35:32,860
Where's he going?

406
00:35:33,065 --> 00:35:38,367
Brother, just let me get married
to him... I'll kill him.

407
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:58,088
Porter. Take this carefully.

408
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:02,819
Father?
Is everything alright at home?

409
00:36:03,029 --> 00:36:04,121
Nothing is right.

410
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,389
Why? Is mother well?

411
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:11,036
Nobody is well. Your mother's
blood pressure has shot up.

412
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,999
What happened?

413
00:36:13,205 --> 00:36:15,799
Mr. Gurucharan had a heart attack
and in the turmoil they...

414
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:18,203
...decided to get Girish
and Lolita married.

415
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:23,439
How's that possible?

416
00:36:24,216 --> 00:36:33,249
Everything is possible today.
Everything has a price.

417
00:36:33,459 --> 00:36:35,256
The price is called out and
then auctioned off.

418
00:36:35,962 --> 00:36:38,192
And all sold to the highest bidder he...

419
00:36:40,633 --> 00:36:42,624
And that girl...

420
00:36:43,636 --> 00:36:46,161
who used to take money
from you her whole life...

421
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:51,332
To pay up the debt of her house
she took money from...

422
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:55,608
Why didn't she come to you?
Do you know why?

423
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:58,649
Because she thinks
you're not a man...

424
00:36:59,819 --> 00:37:03,721
...just a good for nothing, impotent idiot,
who lives off his father.

425
00:37:04,991 --> 00:37:06,322
Will you let her think that?

426
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,456
This wall...?

427
00:37:13,132 --> 00:37:19,469
I had it made.
I don't want to see their faces.

428
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:21,767
I just can't stand them anymore.

429
00:37:28,848 --> 00:37:29,872
Mother...

430
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,645
She's finally fallen asleep.

431
00:37:43,863 --> 00:37:51,463
Are you back, son?
Look what happened in your absence.

432
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:59,343
Mom, are Lolita and Girish...?

433
00:38:00,813 --> 00:38:02,007
Yes, son.

434
00:38:02,715 --> 00:38:03,682
Who told you?

435
00:38:06,218 --> 00:38:14,648
Vasundhara. Maybe this
is what's best.

436
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:19,058
Enough. The doctor has
asked you to rest.

437
00:38:27,173 --> 00:38:28,800
There's no need to go there.

438
00:38:32,078 --> 00:38:33,204
Yes, there is.

439
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:40,350
Your fees, doctor. - Thank You.

440
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:43,553
We've overcome this crisis, Girish.

441
00:38:43,856 --> 00:38:47,656
But you have to take a lot of care.
I'll give you a referral.

442
00:38:48,427 --> 00:38:49,724
Hello, Shekhar. You're back?

443
00:38:49,929 --> 00:38:52,159
How's uncle? - Better now.

444
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:55,731
I think your decision to
go to London is right.

445
00:38:55,935 --> 00:38:57,334
It's the only way.

446
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,026
You're taking him to London?

447
00:38:59,238 --> 00:39:03,470
All of them. The situation
is delicate and...

448
00:39:03,843 --> 00:39:07,370
...I can't prolong my stay anymore.
Doctor, the referral...

449
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,571
Excuse me.

450
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:13,509
I'll give you a letter for Dr. Caine.

451
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:23,123
Koel...

452
00:39:28,434 --> 00:39:32,370
Girish, has the doctor left, son?

453
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:34,035
Yes.

454
00:39:42,181 --> 00:39:46,049
Shekhar, when did you come?

455
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:52,690
Listen... - Yes...

456
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,287
Has he taken the morning capsule?

457
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:58,156
Yes. When is the next dose?

458
00:39:58,898 --> 00:40:00,456
At night, with milk.

459
00:40:02,034 --> 00:40:03,695
But the milk's over.

460
00:40:03,903 --> 00:40:08,306
Don't worry, I'll get more.
Do you need anything else?

461
00:40:08,674 --> 00:40:13,270
No. But tell the milkman to not
come from tomorrow. - Ok.

462
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:17,472
And... the tickets aren't
here yet either.

463
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:30,987
Sir, tickets. Please sign here.

464
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:45,238
When did you return, son?

465
00:40:49,715 --> 00:40:50,909
The tickets are here?

466
00:40:52,785 --> 00:41:01,955
Can you believe your uncle's state? All our
hopes lie with the doctors in London now.

467
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:07,862
Are Lolita and Girish...?

468
00:41:09,902 --> 00:41:19,072
Yes. Your uncle wished it.
And men like Girish are rare.

469
00:41:19,778 --> 00:41:22,110
Mother, please come here.

470
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:23,675
Coming.

471
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,988
Shekhar. Shekhar.

472
00:41:35,694 --> 00:41:40,393
Thank God, you're here.
Everything will be fine now.

473
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:46,399
Right?

474
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:48,863
I can't believe you sold out like this.

475
00:41:53,479 --> 00:41:58,007
Shekhar. - Oh, please.
Women like you...

476
00:42:06,859 --> 00:42:09,157
What do 'respectable' people
like you call us?

477
00:42:11,497 --> 00:42:12,896
Prostitutes, right?

478
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:16,393
Whores.

479
00:42:19,772 --> 00:42:23,208
Your father's words, not yours.

480
00:42:24,276 --> 00:42:26,107
And you're just like him.

481
00:42:29,415 --> 00:42:34,944
If you ever utter a word against him...
...l'll kill you... you...

482
00:42:42,661 --> 00:42:50,432
Night, o' ambassador of black.

483
00:42:51,503 --> 00:42:59,933
Night, o' envoy of dark.

484
00:43:00,846 --> 00:43:07,308
The moon's mate, o' night,
you come to me forlorn.

485
00:43:08,187 --> 00:43:12,920
An era has passed since
we met last, and yet,

486
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:16,094
you come alone?

487
00:43:17,296 --> 00:43:20,732
The mood is solemn...

488
00:43:21,066 --> 00:43:25,901
...only the crickets mourn.

489
00:43:34,546 --> 00:43:39,245
The moon's mate, o' night,
you come to me forlorn.

490
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:44,081
Where is your friend,
the elusive moon;

491
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:47,850
why do you come alone?

492
00:43:51,063 --> 00:43:56,091
Extinguish the twilight,

493
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:59,464
eclipse the dark...

494
00:43:59,638 --> 00:44:03,404
...I only wish to speak

495
00:44:07,379 --> 00:44:09,472
to the pitch in the black.

496
00:44:09,748 --> 00:44:17,052
The night is sad...

497
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:25,559
...it's heavy with grief...

498
00:44:25,831 --> 00:44:30,165
...sitting in its own dark shadow.

499
00:44:36,842 --> 00:44:41,711
The moon's mate, o' night,
you come to me forlorn.

500
00:44:41,914 --> 00:44:46,544
An era has passed since we met last,

501
00:44:46,752 --> 00:44:50,984
and yet, you come alone?

502
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:56,116
Extinguish the twilight,

503
00:44:56,328 --> 00:44:58,592
eclipse the dark...

504
00:44:58,797 --> 00:45:03,359
...I only wish to speak

505
00:45:03,569 --> 00:45:07,005
to the pitch in the black.

506
00:45:08,941 --> 00:45:09,839
You're here?

507
00:45:10,242 --> 00:45:11,834
We're leaving tonight...

508
00:45:12,044 --> 00:45:15,605
You have no business
with anyone here.

509
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:20,818
Please give this key to Shekhar.

510
00:45:23,956 --> 00:45:25,719
Brother... Shekhar.

511
00:45:27,493 --> 00:45:32,954
Shekhar. Koel. - Enough. Leave.

512
00:45:33,165 --> 00:45:34,632
You've got your hands
on a treasure chest...

513
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:37,131
...what do you need this key for?

514
00:45:44,343 --> 00:45:46,470
The darkness is maddening,

515
00:45:46,678 --> 00:45:48,873
opaque and dense.

516
00:45:49,081 --> 00:45:51,208
It pricks, it stings;

517
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:53,646
it's a welcome offence.

518
00:45:53,852 --> 00:45:56,013
I seek its lap

519
00:45:56,221 --> 00:46:00,885
to end my day...

520
00:46:01,093 --> 00:46:03,323
...I join its embrace

521
00:46:03,529 --> 00:46:07,659
to veil my dismay.

522
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,099
Like my black renegade kohl,

523
00:46:13,305 --> 00:46:17,799
it streams down my face.

524
00:46:20,045 --> 00:46:25,073
The moon's mate, o' night,
you come to me forlorn.

525
00:46:25,284 --> 00:46:29,846
Where is your friend,
the elusive moon,

526
00:46:30,055 --> 00:46:33,752
why do you come alone?

527
00:46:36,828 --> 00:46:39,388
Extinguish the twilight,

528
00:46:39,598 --> 00:46:41,725
eclipse the dark...

529
00:46:41,934 --> 00:46:46,598
...I only wish to speak

530
00:46:46,805 --> 00:46:50,434
to the pitch in the black.

531
00:46:53,178 --> 00:47:00,016
The night is sad...

532
00:47:00,452 --> 00:47:10,123
...it's heavy with grief...
- Let's go, Lolita.

533
00:47:12,297 --> 00:47:15,698
...sitting in its own dark shadow.

534
00:48:09,788 --> 00:48:11,085
Not a musician...

535
00:48:15,661 --> 00:48:17,094
Just a businessman.

536
00:48:19,698 --> 00:48:20,858
Uncle Raghu...

537
00:48:26,972 --> 00:48:29,907
Son. - Yes, mother.

538
00:48:30,976 --> 00:48:34,844
Some bad news...
Mr. Gurucharan is no more.

539
00:48:39,284 --> 00:48:43,618
The wedding happened quickly
to fulfill his last wish.

540
00:48:46,458 --> 00:48:47,550
Is it over?

541
00:48:49,461 --> 00:48:52,862
Yes. Girish managed everything.

542
00:48:55,334 --> 00:49:00,101
They'll be here next week
for the last rites.

543
00:52:32,517 --> 00:52:33,677
What's happening to you, son?

544
00:52:33,952 --> 00:52:35,419
Is everything okay?

545
00:52:37,188 --> 00:52:42,592
Tell Mr. Tantiya I'm ready to
marry his daughter Gayatri.

546
00:52:43,094 --> 00:52:48,726
Wonderful, son. I'll call them
first thing tomorrow morning.

547
00:52:49,868 --> 00:52:51,062
Come on, Rajeshwari.

548
00:53:26,638 --> 00:53:28,765
Have you composed this?

549
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,767
No. It's Tagore's, stupid.

550
00:54:09,481 --> 00:54:13,645
Hello, Shekhar. Congratulations.

551
00:54:18,289 --> 00:54:19,950
Here to just congratulate me?

552
00:54:20,525 --> 00:54:25,929
I'm also here to give you
a parcel from Lolita.

553
00:54:28,033 --> 00:54:29,022
What's this?

554
00:54:30,702 --> 00:54:33,034
The papers to their house.

555
00:54:34,572 --> 00:54:35,698
Why are you giving it to me?

556
00:54:36,841 --> 00:54:38,274
Consider it your wedding gift.

557
00:54:41,146 --> 00:54:44,673
Tell her I don't want her charity.

558
00:54:45,884 --> 00:54:48,876
Not charity - a debt.

559
00:54:50,288 --> 00:54:55,225
She said she'll never be able
to pay you back completely.

560
00:54:56,327 --> 00:54:57,487
...but she's trying.

561
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:00,698
Your wife's become pretty smart.

562
00:55:02,233 --> 00:55:11,835
Yes. And I really love her.

563
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,045
Isn't this the tune you two sang?

564
00:55:25,256 --> 00:55:27,156
Day and night.

565
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,355
It made me insanely jealous

566
00:55:33,531 --> 00:55:35,931
as to how someone
could love so much.

567
00:55:37,268 --> 00:55:41,568
But marriage cured me.

568
00:55:43,041 --> 00:55:50,243
My clever wife cured me my Koel.

569
00:55:51,216 --> 00:55:51,910
Koel?

570
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:58,453
I know what you're thinking,
and rightly so.

571
00:55:59,858 --> 00:56:05,490
I loved Lolita very much...
but when I proposed to her

572
00:56:09,134 --> 00:56:11,068
...she said she was already married.

573
00:56:11,736 --> 00:56:15,502
I asked her but she didn't tell
me her husband's name.

574
00:56:16,374 --> 00:56:24,076
...But she never so miserable
...not even to Koel.

575
00:56:26,751 --> 00:56:31,654
But when she gave you
the house, I knew.

576
00:56:33,324 --> 00:56:37,192
The money you had given her
turned into a debt the day you...

577
00:56:37,395 --> 00:56:39,556
...decided to marry Gayatri.

578
00:56:41,866 --> 00:56:47,736
This debt will become a burden for her.
And she won't bear this burden...

579
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,965
A burden she wasn't willing to carry.
That's who she is.

580
00:56:53,611 --> 00:57:00,414
I wanted to find that foolish man
and drag him to her feet.

581
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:10,450
But you... you're not even worthy
of her feet. I pity you, Shekhar.

582
00:57:11,563 --> 00:57:13,997
You lost what was already yours.

583
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:19,063
You're the most unfortunate soul
in the world.

584
00:57:23,074 --> 00:57:26,771
When are you all leaving?
- Right now.

585
00:57:29,047 --> 00:57:33,347
What have I done?
What do I do...?

586
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:35,081
Shekhar.

587
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,725
Ask daddy dearest.

588
00:57:56,574 --> 00:57:57,939
Why was Girish here?

589
00:58:08,019 --> 00:58:08,781
What is this?

590
00:58:16,928 --> 00:58:24,300
The papers of the house.

591
00:58:26,004 --> 00:58:32,705
He was here to make this deal?
How much does he want?

592
00:58:33,778 --> 00:58:39,910
Mr. Tantiya will be delighted.
Hello? Mr. Tantiya, please?

593
00:58:40,451 --> 00:58:43,011
Good news, Mr. Tantiya...

594
00:58:43,288 --> 00:58:45,984
we've got the house.

595
00:58:47,692 --> 00:58:49,819
We're just leaving for your house.

596
00:58:51,362 --> 00:58:57,062
My son has accomplished
what I couldn't.

597
00:58:57,902 --> 00:59:02,498
Behold. Mr. Gurucharan's house papers.

598
00:59:02,874 --> 00:59:06,537
Thank God, it's yours now.

599
00:59:07,879 --> 00:59:11,110
Or else God knows how many more
lives would've been destroyed.

600
00:59:11,649 --> 00:59:16,484
The house that killed Mr. Gurucharan
got Lolita...

601
00:59:16,688 --> 00:59:22,126
...fired with such indignity created
a wall between two families...

602
00:59:22,327 --> 00:59:23,453
Rajeshwari. Be quiet.

603
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:27,262
Thank God, it's yours now.

604
00:59:27,465 --> 00:59:28,796
What is so wrong?

605
00:59:29,167 --> 00:59:34,036
He couldn't repay so I kept the house.

606
00:59:34,238 --> 00:59:39,039
You gave him the money
knowing fully well he'd...

607
00:59:39,243 --> 00:59:40,505
...never be able to repay.

608
00:59:40,712 --> 00:59:43,943
It's business.
And I'm a businessman.

609
00:59:44,148 --> 00:59:49,051
A very bad one.
Such a profitless deal.

610
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:51,414
Why? What's the price?

611
00:59:51,622 --> 00:59:56,423
It's free... but too expensive for you.

612
00:59:57,362 --> 00:59:58,693
You've got everything.

613
00:59:59,097 --> 01:00:04,228
...an empire, fame...
and now this house too.

614
01:00:05,336 --> 01:00:07,964
But nobody is poorer than you today...

615
01:00:09,374 --> 01:00:11,239
...because you got the house...

616
01:00:14,345 --> 01:00:15,437
...but you've lost your son.

617
01:00:15,646 --> 01:00:19,550
You've gone mad.
You're going to be wed in a while.

618
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:20,482
Mr. Tantiya is expecting us...

619
01:00:20,618 --> 01:00:26,147
...Ask him... will he wed his
daughter to a married man?

620
01:00:26,357 --> 01:00:27,654
What? - Yes.

621
01:00:28,926 --> 01:00:30,416
I'm already married.

622
01:00:30,762 --> 01:00:31,524
To whom?

623
01:00:32,764 --> 01:00:33,696
Lolita.

624
01:00:34,499 --> 01:00:36,865
Really, son? When?

625
01:00:38,169 --> 01:00:39,727
I don't consider it a marriage.

626
01:00:40,405 --> 01:00:42,270
Give her some money and...

627
01:00:42,473 --> 01:00:48,378
Enough. My wife is not for sale.

628
01:00:50,081 --> 01:00:55,678
Your mind is governed only
by money, isn't it, dad?

629
01:00:57,989 --> 01:00:59,422
And I feel sorry that

630
01:00:59,624 --> 01:01:02,320
I was following your path.

631
01:01:03,494 --> 01:01:04,825
You poisoned my mind so deeply;

632
01:01:04,996 --> 01:01:06,964
I saw everything through your eyes.

633
01:01:08,866 --> 01:01:15,066
I was reduced to business, deals,
money just like you...

634
01:01:17,141 --> 01:01:21,578
I even raised my hand on my wife.

635
01:01:22,847 --> 01:01:25,179
Stop it, son.

636
01:01:30,221 --> 01:01:31,245
Where are you going?

637
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:37,828
To be a good husband
and bring my wife home.

638
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:39,826
You won't go anywhere.

639
01:01:58,883 --> 01:02:00,214
Where are you going, son?

640
01:02:37,788 --> 01:02:38,812
What's overcome him?

641
01:02:39,023 --> 01:02:39,648
Shekhar.

642
01:02:49,367 --> 01:02:50,334
Shekhar.

643
01:02:52,537 --> 01:02:53,663
Shekhar.

644
01:02:57,008 --> 01:02:59,306
Break it, Shekhar.

645
01:03:00,778 --> 01:03:01,642
Break it.

646
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,539
Ajit, stop him.

647
01:03:04,782 --> 01:03:13,850
Break it, Shekhar. Break it.
Break it, damn it.

648
01:03:14,692 --> 01:03:20,096
Break it, Shekhar. Break it.

649
01:03:46,624 --> 01:03:51,561
Stop watching the circus and
stop him. Call the police.

650
01:03:52,530 --> 01:04:02,906
Break it, Shekhar. Break it.

651
01:04:03,374 --> 01:04:05,899
What is this commotion?
- I'll check.

652
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:10,174
Rajeshwari.

653
01:04:13,985 --> 01:04:20,049
Break it, son. Destroy it forever.

654
01:06:04,061 --> 01:06:11,229
Here, light these.
Light up the whole house.

655
01:06:11,469 --> 01:06:18,500
My daughter-in-law is home.

656
01:06:26,684 --> 01:06:29,118
Yes, tonight is Shekhar's wedding night.

657
01:06:30,087 --> 01:06:33,215
Just a few players have changed.

658
01:06:34,058 --> 01:06:36,618
And the city's dreams and
joys have returned.

659
01:06:36,827 --> 01:06:42,459
Calcutta is once again a city of joy.
