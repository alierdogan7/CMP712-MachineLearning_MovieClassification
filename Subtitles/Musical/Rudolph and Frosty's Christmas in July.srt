1
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,406
Hey, Frosty!

2
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:20,145
Hey, Rudolph!

3
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:27,185
What a great June day!

4
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,159
Positively balmy.

5
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:30,797
Only 10 below.

6
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:34,531
Rudolph, can the kids watch
your jumping practice?

7
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,328
Sure.

8
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:40,263
Millie. Chilly.

9
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:44,633
- Okay. Daddy.
- Here we come.

10
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:53,276
Would you light up your nose for us.
Uncle Rudolph?

11
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,182
Just once. Please?

12
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:58,518
Okay. Just once.

13
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:07,290
- Rudolph.
- What's the matter with your nose?

14
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,498
I-- I don't know.

15
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:13,863
It-- it's going out.

16
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:57,931
Yes, sir. Believe it or not,
Rudolph's nose went out.

17
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:02,542
And all because of something
that started years and years ago.

18
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,041
And I mean years.

19
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:11,083
Long before I came to the North Pole,
all this territory was ruled over...

20
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:16,985
<i>...by a powerful magic king
of the North Pole named...</i>

21
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:19,524
<i>...Winterbolt.</i>

22
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,561
<i>And this terrible tyrant's powers
came from a scepter of solid ice.</i>

23
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:43,780
<i>All the good creatures
who dared defy his wickedness...</i>

24
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:48,512
<i>...were destroyed or driven away
from their Northland homes.</i>

25
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:53,990
<i>Old Winterbolt's tyranny lasted for ages.</i>

26
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,528
<i>But one day...</i>

27
00:04:56,696 --> 00:05:00,963
<i>...there came a being
who was more than his match.</i>

28
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:07,803
<i>Lady Boreal, the queen
of the northern lights...</i>

29
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:12,468
<i>...who took on human form
in order to defy Winterbolt...</i>

30
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,707
<i>...and defend the oppressed and innocent.</i>

31
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,374
King Winterbolt.

32
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:21,920
For years I have seen
your malevolent cruelty.

33
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:25,487
And now I take human form
to command thee...

34
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,451
...stop this tyranny at once!

35
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:31,359
You've caused enough pain
and unhappiness.

36
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:36,093
You don't frighten me. Begone.

37
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:43,538
You had your chance,
cruel monarch of the North...

38
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,270
...and now I must silence you.

39
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:51,145
- Forever?
- Alas, nothing is forever.

40
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:54,754
But you will fall into a deep, deep, sleep.

41
00:05:54,921 --> 00:06:00,155
And so you shall remain,
so long as my magic burns bright.

42
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:08,933
Too powerful for me.

43
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:14,097
Your force overwhelms me.

44
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:17,471
<i>And he fell into a profound sleep...</i>

45
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:21,239
<i>...of many, many winters.</i>

46
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:33,760
<i>And eventually, Winterbolt
and all his evil were forgotten.</i>

47
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:38,728
<i>The good and gentle creatures
returned to the North.</i>

48
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,493
<i>First, the animals...</i>

49
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:46,231
<i>...and then the little ones,
the Kringle elves.</i>

50
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,470
<i>And I suppose it was
Lady Boreal's good grace...</i>

51
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:55,240
<i>...which led me and my young bride
to these Northlands.</i>

52
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:01,750
<i>The perfect place for me
to build my toy factory...</i>

53
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:08,328
<i>...and carry out my life's mission,
far away from all who would stop me.</i>

54
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,704
<i>The passing years were good to all of us.</i>

55
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:26,437
<i>But Lady Boreal's monumental efforts
had drained her of most of her magic...</i>

56
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,139
<i>...and all of her strength.</i>

57
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:33,480
<i>She knew her days as a human
were numbered.</i>

58
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:39,589
Alas, nothing is forever.

59
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,061
But in Santa, the Northlands
have a kind and true leader.

60
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,690
And I may rest with ease.

61
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:56,405
<i>And she became again the magic glow
of the aurora borealis.</i>

62
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:13,989
I am awake, I live again!

63
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,720
Winterbolt lives!

64
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:24,629
I can't wait to see what's been going on
while I've been resting.

65
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:39,484
Who is this my magic eye of snow shows?

66
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,814
He looks to be a king.

67
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:46,516
But there can be no king
of the North, save me.

68
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,491
I must rid my Northlands
of this ho-ho-ho'ing creature...

69
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:54,326
...and his flock of Christmas interlopers.

70
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,736
But how?

71
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:03,035
Tell me, O Genie of the Ice Scepter.

72
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:11,480
His power comes from
the love he receives...

73
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:16,111
...from children all over the world.

74
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:18,550
Is he as powerful as me?

75
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:23,629
At the moment, far more powerful.

76
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:29,395
Then I shall make the world's children
love me instead of him.

77
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:34,234
Tell me, how does he please
these children?

78
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:40,135
Each Christmas Eve,
he sets forth in his sleigh...

79
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:46,480
...and leaves every child a toy
before dawn.

80
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,583
Is that all?

81
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:54,216
Genie, tell me how I might stop him
from going forth.

82
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:57,728
Next Christmas Eve...

83
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:03,768
...have the snow dragons
create a storm of ice and fog...

84
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:08,966
...the likes of which
the North has never seen.

85
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,770
Santa will become hopelessly lost...

86
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:21,150
...and the toys will never be delivered.

87
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,483
Bravo. Excellent!

88
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:27,991
Then I shall set forth
with my own supply of toys...

89
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:31,597
...in my own sleigh.

90
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:36,659
Why. I could be greater than Santa!

91
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:40,272
I'd give the little brats
twice as many toys...

92
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,536
...and they would love me more.

93
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:48,446
They'd become lazy
and dependent on me...

94
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:50,947
...and I would rule them all.

95
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,643
And when they grew up,
why, the whole world...

96
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,849
...would be my own personal snowball!

97
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:06,195
How little Winterbolt knows
of the ways of Santa and children.

98
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:09,825
There's more than just getting toys.

99
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,970
There is kindness...

100
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:16,575
...and the loving warmth
of a family on Christmas morn.

101
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:20,043
These things cannot die.

102
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:24,074
I will not let them.

103
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:29,546
But I am so old and weak.

104
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:35,560
Ice and fog on Christmas Eve
to hinder Santa's sleigh.

105
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:39,258
I must leave him something...

106
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:44,336
...small. I fear, to guide him on his way.

107
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:54,611
<i>And a little later that day...</i>

108
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:59,082
<i>...a tiny reindeer was born.</i>

109
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,611
Have no fear, my little one.

110
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:05,224
Soon your father will be home.

111
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,858
And I must rest for the moment.

112
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,592
Little one...

113
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,099
...I have so little magic left
to leave thee.

114
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,837
Use it wisely and well.

115
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:29,379
On this small hoof, a magic mark I make.

116
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:34,078
The Christmas star, cradled by a snowflake.

117
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,614
And with this secret mark...

118
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:42,123
...the magic of the northern lights
lives in thee.

119
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,161
How, you ask?

120
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:49,497
Think good thoughts and you will see.

121
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,133
Will the magic last forever, you wonder?

122
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:01,269
Nothing is forever,
as I have often said.

123
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,973
But this magic is strong...

124
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:09,421
...and your nose will glow,
so long as you use it for good.

125
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:15,621
If you are tempted, even once,
to use it for an evil purpose...

126
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,890
...it will be extinguished forever.

127
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,327
Do you understand?

128
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,669
And will you never use it for evil?

129
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:34,840
And now I leave you, little babe,
to your mother's love.

130
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:39,474
Use your secret magic well.

131
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:48,054
What was that? Was someone here?

132
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:54,195
Can't you make up your mind,
my little one?

133
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:57,064
Hey! Where's my boy?

134
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:59,196
Here, my darling.

135
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:04,867
Flew 300 miles in only 15 leaps
when I heard the news and...

136
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,645
Will you just look at him.

137
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:12,308
My little buck.

138
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:13,714
We'll name him...

139
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,679
...Rudolph!

140
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:33,429
O eye of snow, what's this you show?

141
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,827
A red-nosed reindeer?

142
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:40,633
So that's how Santa defeated
my snow dragons.

143
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:46,173
It will be a different story
next Christmas Eve.

144
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:51,340
A red-nosed reindeer is no match
for King Winterbolt!

145
00:15:55,855 --> 00:16:00,019
Hey, it's really going out.

146
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,922
What's happening. Uncle Rudolph?

147
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:06,861
What's wrong with your nose?

148
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:12,764
<i>Dimmer, darker, darker, dimmer</i>

149
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:16,773
<i>Rudolph's magic shall not glimmer</i>

150
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,545
<i>Dark and dim</i>

151
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,374
<i>Dim and dark</i>

152
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:27,213
<i>Now extinguish magic spark!</i>

153
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,120
Rudolph!

154
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:38,187
It's all over. Frosty.

155
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:42,334
My nose is going.

156
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:45,870
I feel awful.

157
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,601
Rudolph, your nose just can't go out.

158
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,438
Santa depends on it.

159
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:55,012
Yeah, but--

160
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,240
There's kids all over the world...

161
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:01,375
...who'd never get any Christmas presents
if you didn't light the way.

162
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:03,613
You're right, Frosty.

163
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:06,554
I can't lose my nose.

164
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,751
Unless... Unless...

165
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:12,055
What are you trying to say?

166
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,027
Can't remember exactly.

167
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:18,865
Something a pretty lady
once whispered to me.

168
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,733
I-- I don't know.

169
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:24,343
But my nose just can't go out!

170
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,342
Don't worry.

171
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:36,850
I'm okay now.

172
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,117
Good old Uncle Rudolph.

173
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:43,961
It's impossible that his power
is greater than mine.

174
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,531
There must be a reason.

175
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:53,030
He has the wonder of the aurora borealis
within him.

176
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:57,836
A power far greater than thine.

177
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:03,145
So long as he uses the nose for good...

178
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,910
...it can never go out.

179
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:10,784
Then I shall see that he uses it for evil.

180
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:15,224
Not in these northern lands, O master.

181
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:20,531
The memory of Lady Boreal
still glows here...

182
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,032
...and protects him.

183
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:26,399
He must be made to leave the North Pole.

184
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:30,404
He sets forth but once a year.

185
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:33,045
Christmas Eve.

186
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:37,376
I cannot wait! There must be a way
to make him leave now!

187
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,747
Help me, O Genie of the Ice Scepter.

188
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,585
Look into thy magic eye of snow.

189
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:50,626
There you will find the answer.

190
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,631
What's this? A balloon?

191
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:08,144
How can a hot-air balloon
help me lure Rudolph away?

192
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,150
I wonder...

193
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:22,994
Rudolph! Hey, Rudolph!

194
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,631
- Hey, it's Milton!
- Who?

195
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:28,392
The flying ice cream man.

196
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:33,629
He keeps his stock up here,
where it won't melt.

197
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:37,800
And this time every year, he picks up
a load to take to the seashore...

198
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:40,674
...for the Fourth of July weekend.

199
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,907
Wait till you meet him. A million laughs!

200
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,676
Come on.

201
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:49,919
Frosty! Millie! Chilly!

202
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:53,184
Dinner's ready, sweethearts.

203
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,192
Sorry. Crystal. I gotta meet somebody.

204
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,888
Rudolph says he's a million laughs.

205
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:02,660
But I've got dinner on the table.
It'll get all warm.

206
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:06,362
You can always cool it up
in the ice stove.

207
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,099
Come on. A million laughs!

208
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:11,937
- Come on, come on!
- Come on, come on!

209
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:15,847
- How you doing. Milton?
- Awful!

210
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:20,912
- What's wrong. Milton?
- I'm in love.

211
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,146
With who?

212
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,516
You're in love with a whole circus?

213
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,254
I'd call a guy like that fickle.

214
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,228
No.

215
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,302
Just with her.

216
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,231
Laine Loraine.

217
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:45,170
<i>Her mother owns the circus.</i>

218
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:49,377
<i>We were gonna be married,
right on the high wire.</i>

219
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:54,352
<i>Hired a preacher and a net
and everything.</i>

220
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,318
<i>Well, what happened?</i>

221
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:59,584
<i>Oh, the circus is going broke.</i>

222
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:04,492
<i>And another showman,
a crook named Sam Spangles...</i>

223
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:09,931
<i>...is ready to pay off the back taxes
and take over the show.</i>

224
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:21,310
Okay, tack it up over here.

225
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:27,509
<i>So you see...</i>

226
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:30,781
<i>...Laine can't even think about romance.</i>

227
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:34,586
And if her mom's show doesn't
get a big audience on the Fourth...

228
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,128
...it'll be sold to Sam Spangles on July 6th.

229
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,268
Laine will have to go on the road.

230
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:45,233
And we'll never get together.

231
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,366
What luck!

232
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,304
Thank you, eye of snow.

233
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:56,745
Rudolph will never suspect a thing.

234
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,183
First, however...

235
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:05,847
...I shall put a little idea
into Milton's empty head.

236
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:21,434
I don't know what to do.

237
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:27,403
Hey! I just got a great idea!

238
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:31,511
There's only one guy who could draw
the kind of crowds...

239
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,449
...the Circus by the Sea needs.

240
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:37,782
- And that's you, Rudolph!
- Me?

241
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:42,258
Why, the kids would just pack that tent
to see you and your nose in person.

242
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:45,860
Uncle Rudolph in the circus?

243
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:48,260
Hey, wait a minute.

244
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:50,835
Rudolph, you just gotta go.

245
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,929
Well, if you say so, pal.

246
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,700
Okay.

247
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,439
It would be wonderful
if we could go with him. Frosty.

248
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:05,448
I sure would like the twins
to see a real circus.

249
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:11,216
If you'd appear too, Frosty,
we'd have to get a bigger tent!

250
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,719
- Oh, Daddy.
- Can we?

251
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,294
- Please?
- We'd be good!

252
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:17,691
No way!

253
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:20,560
The seashore on the Fourth of July?

254
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,792
We'd be real misfits.

255
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:25,460
We'd melt in 10 seconds flat!

256
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,668
Being snowpeople has its drawbacks.

257
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:33,813
Sometimes I feel like a real misfit.

258
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:37,506
Oh, Frosty, I just forgot for a minute.

259
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:42,849
I'm sorry. Why. I wouldn't have us
any other way.

260
00:24:56,895 --> 00:25:02,800
That melting business is a nuisance,
but it doesn't make you all misfits. Frosty.

261
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:06,536
Take it from another misfit.

262
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:12,610
If only there was some way
to make you unmeltable.

263
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:19,981
Like a fairy godfather.

264
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:26,348
Just say I'm an old, old, magical friend...

265
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,493
...who wishes to help.

266
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:34,990
Children should see a circus
at least once in their lives.

267
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:38,432
So I will help.

268
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:45,677
But what can you do, sir, to stop
Frosty and his family from melting?

269
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:48,209
Observe.

270
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,845
Magic amulets.

271
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:54,075
If Frosty. Crystal. Millie and Chilly...

272
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:57,689
...wear them about their necks.,
they cannot melt.

273
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:01,918
Even though the temperature
be hot enough to melt steel...

274
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:06,827
...still they will remain cool and icy.

275
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:10,594
Our troubles are over forever!

276
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:13,761
No, not forever.

277
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:17,500
See? On each is a design.

278
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:21,203
The letter F four times entwined.

279
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:26,111
<i>Yeah. “F, F, F, F.“</i>

280
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:28,117
What's that stand for?

281
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:31,279
That means the amulet's magic only lasts...

282
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:36,395
...until the final firework fades
on the Fourth.

283
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:40,866
You must return here
before the fireworks finish...

284
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:45,095
...or you will melt in the heat
of the summer eve.

285
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,760
But until then?

286
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:51,172
Why, you will be safe.

287
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:55,477
- The circus!
- The circus!

288
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:05,248
He certainly does blow in and blow out.

289
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,664
Well, I'm delighted you're all going
for a summer holiday...

290
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:17,666
...but I never heard of any
icy fairy godfather.

291
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:20,066
You should have seen him, sir.

292
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:22,970
I wish I had.

293
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:25,968
Who could he be?

294
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:30,948
Well, I guess I'm just being
over-cautious.

295
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:37,618
You all go on and have a wonderful time.

296
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:43,287
- Just one thing.
- What's wrong. Frosty?

297
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:47,724
It's too bad the kids have to miss
the Fourth of July fireworks.

298
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:51,459
But half a vacation's better
than none. I guess.

299
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:53,696
No, you're right.

300
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:57,640
Children should see fireworks.

301
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,176
Let me think.

302
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,575
And now to entwine them
just a bit more...

303
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:09,551
...into a morass from which
they will never escape.

304
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:23,834
Hey, I just got a wonderful idea!

305
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:27,969
Mama and I will fly my sleigh down
for the Fourth.

306
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:32,043
We'll pick up Frosty and family
just before the fireworks finish...

307
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:35,647
...and whisk back up to the North Pole...

308
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:38,840
...by the time the last one fades.

309
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:42,085
- Wonderful.
- What a neat idea.

310
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:44,313
I can't believe it!

311
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:48,619
Rudolph. Frosty and now Santa.

312
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:54,733
Why, this-- This really will be the greatest
show in the-- In the universe!

313
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:59,031
It will!

314
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:36,038
???

315
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:54,323
Oh, Frosty, it's lovely.

316
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:58,487
- Oh, look over there.
- It's the circus!

317
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,789
Yep. They're starting to set up
their tents.

318
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:08,296
Come on, you guys,
let's get this tent up!

319
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,840
Oh, Mama, look, it's Milton.

320
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:15,639
Hi, Laine. Hi, Ms. Loraine.

321
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:18,075
Oh, Mama, isn't he wonderful?

322
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,742
He's the greatest ice cream man
in the world.

323
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:24,753
Oh, forget him, honey.
There's one thing life's taught me:

324
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:27,051
You can't live on banana splits.

325
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:36,465
Laine, look who I've got for the show!

326
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:40,697
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
and Frosty the Snowman!

327
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:43,534
- In person.
- In person.

328
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:47,237
Well, I'll be...

329
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,009
Oh, Mama, we'll be a hit!

330
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:54,414
- What do you think of Milton now?
- Maybe I was wrong.

331
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:57,283
Milton's like the butter pecan he sells:

332
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:59,891
A little nuts but mighty yummy!

333
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:05,553
Oh, Milton.

334
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:11,829
Oh, Laine. Now everything
will turn out all right.

335
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:15,029
Rudolph and Frosty? I can't believe it.

336
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,335
And Santa Claus too.

337
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:21,412
Santa too? What an idea for a closing act.

338
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,444
Print more tickets!

339
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:27,083
Why, it's just like Christmas
is coming early this year.

340
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:31,985
Oh, Milton.
Everything is just perfect now.

341
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:38,027
Now we got something to work for.
Come on with that tent.

342
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:42,099
Heave ho-ho-ho! Heave ho-ho-ho!

343
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:44,600
What's with the “ho-ho-ho“?

344
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:48,434
Well, it is Christmas, isn't it?

345
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:02,207
And I suppose they believe...

346
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:06,681
...everyone will live happily ever after.

347
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:09,052
Never!

348
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:15,358
And now for the snow dragons.

349
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:20,431
Make yourselves ready, my pretties.

350
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,603
Build fury in your hearts.

351
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:32,471
Soon I will have
a very special job for you.

352
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:44,586
What is thy will, O master?

353
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,991
Genie of the Ice Scepter...

354
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:51,425
...find me a reindeer as mean
as Rudolph is kind.

355
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:55,226
As cunning as Rudolph is guileless.

356
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,303
As selfish as Rudolph is giving.

357
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:03,339
A corrupt, cunning knave of a creature...

358
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:07,103
...with ambition to equal my own.

359
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:11,110
But why, O master?

360
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:15,111
All part of my plan, good genie.

361
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:18,848
All part of my plan.

362
00:34:19,024 --> 00:34:22,119
Find me such a reindeer!

363
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:27,497
Beyond the Forest
of the Burned Christmas Trees...

364
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:31,466
...and the Hill of the Broken Baubles...

365
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:37,837
...there you will find
the Caves of Lost Rejections.

366
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:41,240
Ask the keeper for...

367
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:50,912
He's in cave number 13.

368
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,251
I wish to see him.

369
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,052
You ain't the only one.

370
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:57,661
I've been trying to throw him out
all week.

371
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,695
Behind in his rent, he is.

372
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:04,301
But he's mean
and I don't fancy risking my neck.

373
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,563
Thirteen, you say?

374
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,070
That's right this way.

375
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:19,784
Scratcher!

376
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:23,685
- What do you want?
- Come forth.

377
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:27,985
- Make me.
- Very well.

378
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:36,423
Hey! What's happening?

379
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:45,238
All right, all right.
For crying out loud.

380
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,310
I'll pay the rent.

381
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:50,642
I don't want the rent.

382
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:54,274
I want Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.

383
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:56,887
And you will help me.

384
00:35:57,055 --> 00:36:01,754
Rudolph? Don't mention that name.

385
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:06,488
I was all set to be one of Santa's reindeer,
when he came along.

386
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:12,069
Indeed. Santa fired you
to make room for Rudolph?

387
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:18,199
Well, I also stole some toys and ate
a whole new batch of candy canes.

388
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,845
Candy? Excellent!

389
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:23,408
It was all downhill from there.

390
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:26,141
Till I finally ended up in this joint.

391
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:27,713
<i>Good.</i>

392
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:32,050
- How would you like to work for me?
- Doing what?

393
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:36,387
Destroying Rudolph
the Red-Nosed Reindeer.

394
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,857
Sounds like a good job to me.

395
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,260
What do I gotta do?

396
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,461
Oh, nothing much.

397
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:49,267
Spend a few luxurious days at the seashore.
Get to know Rudolph.

398
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:53,571
Lead him astray, as it were.

399
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:57,443
Gee, it sounds like a pretty good idea.

400
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:02,077
Now, go at once.

401
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:05,518
And find a man named Sam Spangles.

402
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,488
And then...

403
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:13,697
Well, Ms. Loraine,
we're finally ready to open.

404
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:16,857
We worked night and day, kid,
but we made it.

405
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:20,437
Boy, running a circus is no easy job.

406
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:25,805
Well, I tell you, Blinky,
it's got its ups and its downs.

407
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,944
Life with the circus is like
life with a guy.

408
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:32,880
Sometimes you're low
and sometimes you're high.

409
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:29,199
Now, have you memorized
your instructions?

410
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:34,669
Don't worry. Me and Sam Spangles
will take care of everything.

411
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:38,833
Good. Here, nibble on these.

412
00:39:39,244 --> 00:39:42,077
These are Santa's magic feed corn.

413
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:48,713
Hey, that means I'll be able to fly,
like Donner and Blitzen...

414
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:51,913
...and all those other goody-goods.

415
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:58,520
Now, fly forth and do my bidding.

416
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:00,596
What's the hurry?

417
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:06,431
Soon my pets here will blow up
the worst snowstorm of the century.

418
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:08,868
Well, what if I get lost?

419
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,737
I mean, I don't have a red nose,
you know.

420
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:17,041
You'll be well out of these parts
before the storm hits.

421
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:22,085
- I think--
- Will you go forth forthwith?

422
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:30,024
Oh, soon. Soon., my little pets.

423
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:31,628
We mustn't be hasty.

424
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:39,560
Timing is everything
if my intricate plan is to succeed.

425
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:47,837
You really are looking forward to this trip,
aren't you?

426
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:52,640
Papa. I haven't had
a summer vacation since...

427
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:54,342
Can't remember when.

428
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:57,850
We work too hard, Mama.

429
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:03,692
Oh, though I guess I'm not the easiest man
in the world to live with, though.

430
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:09,734
Well, only when it gets close
to Christmas Eve.

431
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:15,706
We have had lots and lots
of Christmas Eves. Mama.

432
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:21,135
- They were good times. Papa.
- And I still love you...

433
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,873
...just as much
as the first day I saw you.

434
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:31,279
Instead of talking, you gave me
a lovely china doll.

435
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:32,956
Well...

436
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:38,153
...giving toys is my way
of saying hello.

437
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:41,256
And showing my love.

438
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:44,026
I know that. Papa.

439
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,904
Mama.

440
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:56,070
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

441
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:58,341
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

442
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,712
11:00, Papa.

443
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:04,344
The circus parade's at 12.
Hurry or we'll miss it.

444
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:11,492
Yes, hurry.

445
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:15,030
Go on, laugh, you old fools...

446
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,362
...while you may.

447
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:26,341
Thank you, little Kringles.

448
00:42:26,511 --> 00:42:29,776
We'll be back, late tonight.

449
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:32,448
Don't wait up.

450
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,352
Away!

451
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:39,354
Away!

452
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:42,550
And away, ho!

453
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:55,295
<i>Use fog to blind and snow to bury</i>

454
00:42:55,473 --> 00:42:58,602
<i>Wind to tear the heart that's merry</i>

455
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:03,646
<i>Ice and gale and sleet and hale</i>

456
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:08,514
<i>Santa must, in his mission, fail</i>

457
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:26,132
Oh, that's an angry wind
for this time of year.

458
00:43:26,304 --> 00:43:29,535
Yes, I don't like it at all.

459
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:32,642
Papa! Look!

460
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:37,176
My goodness, no!

461
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:39,942
We've got to get back!

462
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:42,177
Back. Dasher!

463
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,946
Dancer! Comet!

464
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:48,582
It's too late, Papa, it's got us.

465
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,454
Hold on. Mama!

466
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:57,627
If only Rudolph were here!

467
00:44:37,742 --> 00:44:41,337
Well, we're safe here
in the storm's eye, Mama.

468
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,106
But I'm afraid it's only for a little while.

469
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:47,513
Papa, do you think we'll ever get out?

470
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,313
Well, storms are strange things, dear.

471
00:44:50,488 --> 00:44:53,856
- I mean...
- Are you frightened...

472
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,456
...of what may happen?

473
00:44:56,627 --> 00:45:00,530
No., my dear, not at all.

474
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:03,560
Even with this storm.

475
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,755
Papa.

476
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:43,726
We've gotten out of worse
situations than this.

477
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:45,494
Yes.

478
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:47,900
I say the best thing to do...

479
00:46:48,072 --> 00:46:52,475
...would be to get down from these
stormy skies and continue on the ground.

480
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,941
All right, Mama, we'll try it.

481
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:56,705
Hang on.

482
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,448
Smile. Frosty.

483
00:48:37,615 --> 00:48:41,848
Lilly says that in show business.,
you've gotta keep smiling.

484
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:45,580
But I'm kind of worried
that Santa won't be here on time.

485
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:50,250
- Daddy, the show must go on.
- That's what Aunt Lilly says.

486
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:56,433
Okay. But I got a feeling tonight
there's gonna be a real wet act.

487
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,228
And it won't be the seals.

488
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:11,410
Are you Sam Spangles, the circus man?

489
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:14,916
How can I be a circus man
without a circus?

490
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:20,546
I think I might have
an interesting proposition.

491
00:49:27,932 --> 00:49:32,870
Just do your act like you did in rehearsal,
Blinky, and we're bound to be a hit.

492
00:49:33,037 --> 00:49:36,098
I'll try. Ms. Loraine. I sure will try.

493
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:39,243
Well, I gotta give a pep talk
to the clowns.

494
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:41,777
Hang in there, Blinky.

495
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,880
Hey, Rudolph.

496
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:50,485
- Scratcher?
- Oh, the big star remembers his old buddy.

497
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:55,251
- We were never buddies.
- Let bygones be bygones.

498
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:00,228
- What's the matter?
- Boy. I am really down and out.

499
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:03,560
Haven't had a bite to eat in three days.

500
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:07,170
Think you could get me a job
with the show?

501
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:10,933
I guess we could use another roustabout
to help with the tents.

502
00:50:11,275 --> 00:50:14,973
You're a prince, Rudolph, a prince.

503
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:16,943
I'll speak to Ms. Loraine.

504
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:20,948
Yeah, you do that, Rudolph.
You just do that.

505
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:24,216
Sucker.

506
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:27,223
Perfect. Perfect.

507
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:30,793
Everything going according to schedule.

508
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:34,829
Now to tighten the net.

509
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:46,533
What a magnificent sleigh and team
the snow genie has created for me.

510
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,645
Instead of reindeer...

511
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:53,772
...I have rein-snakes.

512
00:50:57,655 --> 00:51:02,183
<i>To the top of the porch
To the top of the wall</i>

513
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:05,727
<i>Now slink away, slink away</i>

514
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:09,161
<i>Slink away, all</i>

515
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:25,648
Onward! Onward!

516
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:37,586
Ladies and gentlemen.

517
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:44,064
Welcome to the new edition
of Lilly Loraine's Circus by the Sea.

518
00:51:46,737 --> 00:51:48,796
Bring on the clowns.

519
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:04,886
Boy, this is a great job
you got me. Rudolph.

520
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:08,389
Well, just do it well and I'm sure
you'll get a promotion.

521
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,489
I ain't complaining, old buddy.

522
00:52:12,663 --> 00:52:17,624
Oh, you know, Mrs. Loraine wants me
to get something out of the office wagon...

523
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,997
...but it's all dark in there.

524
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,729
I think a fuse blew.

525
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:24,499
Will you come with me
and give me some light?

526
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:26,336
But I've gotta do my act.

527
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,672
Oh, it won't take a minute.

528
00:52:28,846 --> 00:52:33,044
Let me finish hauling this thing
and I'll meet you over by the wagon.

529
00:52:33,217 --> 00:52:35,015
Well, okay.

530
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:38,883
Oh, you really are a buddy, old buddy.

531
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,649
This is hard.

532
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:46,556
Oh, it...

533
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,256
It's so late. Mama.

534
00:52:49,433 --> 00:52:51,868
Poor Frosty.

535
00:52:52,036 --> 00:52:55,165
We're doing everything we can. Papa.

536
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:59,798
Look up there, Mama.
Black as pitch.

537
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:03,841
Not a star in the sky.

538
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:15,789
Onward! Onward! We don't want
to miss the fireworks, do we?

539
00:53:30,074 --> 00:53:32,839
I forgot my parasol.

540
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:40,082
How many times I gotta tell you?
Make notes for yourself.

541
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,480
Yes, Mama.

542
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:58,357
And now...

543
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:02,597
...presenting one of our star attractions...

544
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:07,635
...Frosty the Snowman and family...

545
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:12,408
...in a sensational, spellbinding exhibition...

546
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:16,918
...of world championship belly-whopping.

547
00:54:21,892 --> 00:54:24,520
Now meet the folks.

548
00:54:28,866 --> 00:54:30,231
Like I always say:

549
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,359
The family that slides together,
abides together.

550
00:54:34,538 --> 00:54:36,870
You don't always say that. Frosty.

551
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,940
Stick to the script, Daddy.

552
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:43,342
If Santa don't get here soon,
we'll be sticking to everything.

553
00:54:43,514 --> 00:54:45,175
Come on!

554
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:02,626
Hey, I've been waiting for you
over by the office wagon.

555
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,529
Come on. Rudolph.

556
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:07,967
That's my warning cue.

557
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:12,837
Look, as soon as I'm done,
I'll meet you by the wagon, I promise.

558
00:55:14,545 --> 00:55:17,276
That's my buddy.

559
00:55:19,583 --> 00:55:22,109
Lights, please.

560
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:26,415
Bring out the fog machine, boys.

561
00:55:37,134 --> 00:55:41,935
- Are you ready. Rudolph?
- I am ready.

562
00:55:42,406 --> 00:55:45,603
Then lights on. Rudolph.

563
00:55:45,776 --> 00:55:48,143
Lights on.

564
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:58,612
He's burned off the fog.

565
00:55:58,789 --> 00:56:00,951
Let's hear it for Rudolph!

566
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:11,197
He'll be back, folks.

567
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:13,264
He'll be back.

568
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:19,534
His act is over. Quick!
Here's the rest of the disguise.

569
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:21,436
Just think.

570
00:56:21,612 --> 00:56:26,482
Me., Sam Spangles, a policeman.

571
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:31,211
Here he comes. Hide.

572
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:38,159
Good old buddy. Now, turn it on.

573
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:45,533
She said it's under the table here.

574
00:56:45,702 --> 00:56:50,139
- What are you looking for?
- She said it was a little leather suitcase.

575
00:56:50,307 --> 00:56:52,935
Oh, there it is.
Gee, thanks, old buddy.

576
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,348
I hurt myself.

577
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:01,075
Just taking a little fall like that?

578
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:05,210
I twisted my nose...
My neck or something.

579
00:57:05,389 --> 00:57:09,792
Now I can't pick up that suitcase.
Buddy, would you do it for me?

580
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,928
Well, sure.

581
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,928
All this fuss over a little suitcase.

582
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:18,193
- What's inside?
- Well, she didn't say.

583
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:21,929
Just pick it up and give it to the cop
waiting on the corner.

584
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,595
Okay, but...

585
00:57:24,875 --> 00:57:30,245
Hey, this bag is filled with money.
The night's receipts.

586
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:34,709
That's why she wants
to give it to the cop.

587
00:57:34,985 --> 00:57:38,615
So he can take it to the bank
and make a night deposit.

588
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:41,156
Well, okay.

589
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:51,459
And now for our grand
Christmas in July finale.

590
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:33,534
Whether July or December.
Christmas lives in our hearts.

591
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:40,173
But it's up at the North Pole, remember,
where Christmas always starts.

592
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:55,124
Where are my elves?

593
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:57,399
Oh, hark!

594
00:58:57,567 --> 00:58:59,661
Here they come now.

595
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:08,607
Elephants? I thought the midgets
were gonna play the elves.

596
00:59:08,779 --> 00:59:11,749
No, they wanna play the polar bears.

597
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:13,440
Actors.

598
00:59:14,451 --> 00:59:16,215
Very good, elves.

599
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:17,979
But I have an idea...

600
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:21,523
...of what will bring all of us
lots of cheer.

601
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:26,356
So just to please all the girls
and the boys...

602
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:29,261
...why don't we have a parade
of the toys.

603
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:15,404
And now, to make us all feel jolly,
my very best toy:

604
01:00:15,579 --> 01:00:18,276
A dancing dolly.

605
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:48,699
Thank you, me fine lad.

606
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:51,500
Well, off to the bank.

607
01:01:55,478 --> 01:02:00,314
- Where were you, Rudolph?
- Frosty, something funny is going on.

608
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:02,417
I don't think it's so funny.

609
01:02:02,586 --> 01:02:04,918
I'm just about ready to give up hope.

610
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:06,920
Oh, I don't mean that.

611
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:09,218
Here's your star.

612
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:13,586
Frosty. Santa gave his word.

613
01:02:13,797 --> 01:02:17,097
He'll be here before the fireworks are over.

614
01:02:17,267 --> 01:02:18,735
I don't know.

615
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:23,799
You ever see a policeman
wearing a helmet?

616
01:02:23,974 --> 01:02:27,638
No. But then. I never looked for one either.

617
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:29,745
Sure I'm not too heavy?

618
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:33,440
No, but you're kind of chilly.

619
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:47,595
Well, that's the show, folks.

620
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:50,426
A little corny, but expensive.

621
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:57,028
Be sure and hang around outside
for a free Fourth of July fireworks display.

622
01:02:57,207 --> 01:03:01,075
And come back again next year!

623
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:08,978
You hear that. Rudolph?
Time for the fireworks.

624
01:03:09,152 --> 01:03:14,113
I heard. Frosty.
I just don't understand.

625
01:03:14,491 --> 01:03:18,826
And all that business with Scratcher.
Something's real wrong here.

626
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:23,665
- Come on. Daddy. Uncle Rudolph.
- Don't wanna miss the fireworks.

627
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:26,495
Miss them? I'd like to stop them.

628
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:30,664
Why do you want to stop them. Daddy?
Aren't you patriotic?

629
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,172
Sure. I'm patriotic.

630
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:38,878
My only regret is I only have
but one life to melt for my country.

631
01:03:39,449 --> 01:03:42,680
Wait a minute, Frosty.
What you just said--

632
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:45,583
Maybe we can stop the fireworks.

633
01:03:45,789 --> 01:03:48,850
Yeah. Let's find out
who's setting them off.

634
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:51,790
You go this way. I'll go that.

635
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,936
Mrs. Loraine, you've gotta help me.

636
01:04:05,108 --> 01:04:07,099
Anything. Frosty. You just name it.

637
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:10,810
- Stop the fireworks.
- You named the wrong one.

638
01:04:11,481 --> 01:04:13,210
I can't stop them.

639
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:16,080
Once the main fuse is lit,
they keep going.

640
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:19,449
Even if a cloudburst poured down
on top of them.

641
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:29,231
- Why do you want them stopped?
- Well, I got a funny kind of feeling.

642
01:04:29,399 --> 01:04:33,393
- About fireworks?
- No, about melting.

643
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:36,767
- How many are there?
- Exactly 100.

644
01:04:38,308 --> 01:04:39,673
That's number three.

645
01:04:39,843 --> 01:04:41,834
I'm counting. I'm counting!

646
01:04:44,748 --> 01:04:48,582
- Which one's number 100?
- Right over there.

647
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:51,044
That's my number, all right.

648
01:04:51,254 --> 01:04:55,020
And when my number goes up,
my number is up.

649
01:04:55,191 --> 01:04:58,161
And where's Santa?

650
01:05:02,332 --> 01:05:05,267
Still no sign of it letting up. Mama.

651
01:05:05,435 --> 01:05:09,269
I'm afraid we're gonna be too late
to save Frosty.

652
01:05:09,439 --> 01:05:14,309
It's not your fault. Papa.
All we can do is keep going.

653
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:17,913
Faster!

654
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:25,219
That's number 72.

655
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:29,382
Daddy, why are you so worried
about the pretty fireworks?

656
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:32,790
Children, you must be very brave.

657
01:05:33,363 --> 01:05:37,732
Gee, why'd I get everybody
into this mess?

658
01:05:40,003 --> 01:05:41,630
Seventy-four.

659
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,498
We promise to be brave, Mommy.

660
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:47,575
I'm very proud of you.

661
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,273
Seventy-five.

662
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:55,214
Oh, Frosty.

663
01:05:55,385 --> 01:05:57,149
There, there., honey.

664
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:00,654
I just want you to know
that I'm sure glad I married you.

665
01:06:00,824 --> 01:06:03,020
I am too, love.

666
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:22,771
Seventy-six.

667
01:06:22,946 --> 01:06:26,746
Boy. I remember when I could
only count to four.

668
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:28,907
The good old days.

669
01:06:38,895 --> 01:06:45,096
Now to go down and put out
Rudolph's light for good.

670
01:06:47,804 --> 01:06:50,273
Hey! We've been robbed!

671
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:56,139
I went to get the money to give
to Officer Kelly here and it's gone!

672
01:06:56,446 --> 01:06:59,143
He's the policeman
it was supposed to go to?

673
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:01,443
Well, yeah. Why?

674
01:07:01,618 --> 01:07:03,746
Didn't you send Scratcher to fetch it?

675
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:07,515
Me? Let a roustabout reindeer
handle the loot?

676
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,419
I ain't that daffy!

677
01:07:11,895 --> 01:07:15,991
Hey! What do you know
about this. Blinky?

678
01:07:17,567 --> 01:07:19,535
Ninety-one.

679
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,865
Daddy, Mommy, look! It's Santa!

680
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:26,510
Frosty, it's a sleigh!

681
01:07:26,676 --> 01:07:28,906
Oh, boy!

682
01:07:30,947 --> 01:07:33,882
Wait a minute.
It's a sleigh, all right...

683
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,712
...but it's not Santa.

684
01:07:51,034 --> 01:07:54,993
Oh, how I've waited for this moment.

685
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:01,271
Ninety-three.

686
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:03,412
Sir? Sir?

687
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:08,882
My name is Winterbolt.
King Winterbolt.

688
01:08:09,052 --> 01:08:11,578
A king? Gee!

689
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:15,190
Your-- Your Majesty.
Santa never showed up.

690
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:17,190
Yes, I know.

691
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:22,526
- Frosty's time is almost over.
- Just seven more fireworks.

692
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:29,537
Correction: Six.
That was number 94.

693
01:08:29,706 --> 01:08:33,233
You've just got to make those amulets
last a little longer.

694
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:35,400
Maybe even a lot longer.

695
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:39,708
Of course. Of course, my dear friends.

696
01:08:39,882 --> 01:08:42,544
You hear that. Frosty?

697
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:45,880
Wait till I tell the wife and the kids!

698
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:47,784
One moment!

699
01:08:50,893 --> 01:08:53,362
Ninety-five.

700
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:56,191
We don't have to bother
keeping count anymore.

701
01:08:56,366 --> 01:08:59,597
- Oh, yes, you do.
- What do you mean?

702
01:08:59,769 --> 01:09:03,069
I will make the amulets' power last.
Rudolph...

703
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:08,507
...only so long as your nose
remains extinguished.

704
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,345
My nose is not extinguished.

705
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:14,506
Really? Try to light it.

706
01:09:16,786 --> 01:09:18,777
Ninety-six.

707
01:09:18,955 --> 01:09:20,650
Go ahead. Rudolph.

708
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:23,224
I'm trying.

709
01:09:23,393 --> 01:09:26,795
I'm trying real hard.

710
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:40,835
Rudolph! What's wrong?

711
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,707
It-- It won't light up.

712
01:09:44,213 --> 01:09:46,204
What did you do to it, Winterbolt?

713
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:49,977
I didn't do a thing.
You did it to yourself.

714
01:09:50,153 --> 01:09:54,454
You used your nose for an evil purpose.

715
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:57,490
You robbed the money
from the box office wagon...

716
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:00,994
...and gave it to one Sam Spangles.

717
01:10:03,566 --> 01:10:05,295
Sorry, sucker.

718
01:10:06,436 --> 01:10:10,896
- I don't understand.
- They tricked me. Frosty.

719
01:10:13,176 --> 01:10:15,440
Well, I'm gonna set things straight.

720
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:18,103
I'll tell everybody what really happened.

721
01:10:18,281 --> 01:10:19,806
No, you won't.

722
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:24,419
I warn you, if you clear your name
to save your nose...

723
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:26,919
...the Frostys all will melt.

724
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:32,456
Admit your guilt and I will allow them
to remain frozen.

725
01:10:34,764 --> 01:10:36,596
Ninety-seven.

726
01:10:37,467 --> 01:10:39,902
Ninety-eight. Only two more.

727
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:42,231
What do you say. Rudolph?

728
01:10:43,139 --> 01:10:46,541
Okay. I won't tell anybody the truth.

729
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:50,373
I'll take the blame
and let my nose go out.

730
01:10:52,949 --> 01:10:54,610
Ninety-nine.

731
01:10:55,218 --> 01:10:59,280
But you just can't let your nose
go out forever. Rudolph.

732
01:10:59,455 --> 01:11:02,288
I don't have any choice. Frosty.

733
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:06,322
Come on.
We only have one firework left.

734
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:13,633
Only one more. Where is Frosty?

735
01:11:13,803 --> 01:11:15,771
Hey, what's going on here?

736
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:20,136
Ms. Loraine. I--
I stole that money.

737
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:22,607
- What?!
- Uncle Rudolph?

738
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:24,372
I don't believe it.

739
01:11:24,547 --> 01:11:28,074
No, he-- I mean, I can explain.

740
01:11:28,251 --> 01:11:30,686
No, Frosty, don't!

741
01:11:31,154 --> 01:11:34,647
I stole the money, ma'am,
and I gave it to Sam Spangles.

742
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:38,521
Spangles? That means
he takes over the show.

743
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:41,186
Rudolph, what got into you?

744
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:43,693
I can't explain.

745
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:49,538
One hundred!

746
01:11:49,705 --> 01:11:51,605
Oh, Frosty!

747
01:11:51,774 --> 01:11:55,938
Relax. Crystal.
We aren't gonna melt. See?

748
01:11:56,112 --> 01:11:59,082
Why-- Why, you're right.

749
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:01,012
Mommy, we're saved!

750
01:12:01,184 --> 01:12:04,017
Oh, Daddy, we're not gonna melt.

751
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:07,923
Congratulations.
Now you don't have to worry.

752
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:11,291
I'm sorry, Rudolph,
but I don't want the twins...

753
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:14,555
“associating with a dishonest reindeer.

754
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:18,360
- Uncle Rudolph...
- Why'd you do it?

755
01:12:19,268 --> 01:12:21,669
No, wait. You don't understand.

756
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:26,139
Frosty, you must never tell them
that I didn't do it.

757
01:12:26,309 --> 01:12:28,744
- But. Rudolph--
- Never!

758
01:12:29,212 --> 01:12:32,341
What's more important?
A silly old red nose...

759
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:35,212
...or the lives of my best friend
and his family?

760
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:40,720
Rudolph, what can I say?
You sure are a friend.

761
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:44,087
Hey. That funny little mark
on your hoof...

762
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:47,560
...the star inside the snowflake.
It's gone!

763
01:12:49,232 --> 01:12:51,633
Yes, I know.

764
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:55,897
Thanks to Winterbolt, we've done it!

765
01:12:58,341 --> 01:13:02,676
Come. You're the number one reindeer
of the North now.

766
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:04,813
You bet.

767
01:13:07,016 --> 01:13:09,417
Away! Away!

768
01:13:14,924 --> 01:13:17,188
So long.

769
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:22,431
Okay, creeps. There's gonna be
some changes around here.

770
01:13:22,598 --> 01:13:26,831
- You don't own the show yet.
- Wanna bet?

771
01:13:27,003 --> 01:13:28,903
Who's gonna pay to see:

772
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:34,805
<i>Rudolph the unlit reindeer
With the very nothing nose</i>

773
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:40,310
I can't wait till tomorrow night!

774
01:13:46,555 --> 01:13:48,216
I'm sorry.

775
01:13:48,557 --> 01:13:51,083
But I can still do my jumps.

776
01:13:53,963 --> 01:14:00,232
<i>We want our money back!
We want our money back!</i>

777
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:09,673
Rudolph?

778
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:13,304
How can you even speak to him,
after what he did to my mother?

779
01:14:13,482 --> 01:14:15,473
But there must be some reason.

780
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:19,417
We're old friends.
You can tell me. Rudolph.

781
01:14:19,588 --> 01:14:21,317
There's nothing to tell.

782
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:24,187
I stole the money and gave it
to Sam Spangles.

783
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:28,888
- But. Rudolph--
- Just-- Just let me be. Milton.

784
01:14:29,065 --> 01:14:31,591
You heard him. Let's go, Milton.

785
01:14:31,767 --> 01:14:33,826
Goodbye. Rudolph.

786
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:36,668
Goodbye...

787
01:14:36,839 --> 01:14:38,705
...for good.

788
01:16:04,693 --> 01:16:08,994
There must be something I can do alone
that wouldn't hurt the family.

789
01:16:09,165 --> 01:16:12,601
Maybe I could give Winterbolt
something in exchange.

790
01:16:13,135 --> 01:16:16,036
But what do I have that he'd want?

791
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:21,777
What, indeed? His corncob pipe?

792
01:16:22,144 --> 01:16:24,169
He does have something.

793
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:26,838
I don't know.
He might have something.

794
01:16:27,016 --> 01:16:29,508
Why not ask the genie.

795
01:16:30,019 --> 01:16:34,388
Frosty the Snowman
has his own magic...

796
01:16:34,557 --> 01:16:37,993
...which could prove quite valuable.

797
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,857
Really? Tell me, what is it?

798
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:42,794
His hat.

799
01:16:42,965 --> 01:16:46,526
Let me show you, O master.

800
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:53,429
Just think...

801
01:17:53,602 --> 01:17:59,803
...if you had that hat and could
find the secret of its magic...

802
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:06,582
...you could duplicate it over
and over again, O master.

803
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:15,318
Why, you could bring an army
of snowmen to life.

804
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:30,837
And Frosty, the only one who knows...

805
01:18:31,006 --> 01:18:34,670
...the true secret of Rudolph's nose...

806
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:37,869
...would be lifeless.

807
01:18:38,581 --> 01:18:41,573
Yes, and I would be safe.

808
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:44,776
But what could I give Frosty for his hat?

809
01:18:44,954 --> 01:18:47,753
Lie to him, my master.

810
01:18:47,923 --> 01:18:49,789
Deceive him.

811
01:18:49,959 --> 01:18:53,657
Tell him you have the power to restore...

812
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:58,357
...the borealis light to Rudolph's nose.

813
01:18:59,668 --> 01:19:01,329
The light.

814
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:07,473
Of course, of course!

815
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:14,179
Gee, I'd do anything,
anything to help Rudolph.

816
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:26,888
I know what to do.

817
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:34,498
Faster! Faster! Back to the circus lot!

818
01:19:38,741 --> 01:19:41,108
More fireworks?

819
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:44,178
<i>Rudolph.</i>

820
01:19:44,546 --> 01:19:47,538
That voice. I remember.

821
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:50,185
<i>I am no more.</i>

822
01:19:50,352 --> 01:19:54,880
<i>But my love, in the form
of the northern lights...</i>

823
01:19:55,057 --> 01:19:56,991
<i>...watches over thee.</i>

824
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,494
What am I gonna do?

825
01:20:00,663 --> 01:20:04,725
<i>Have no fear,
when you defend the helpless.</i>

826
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:06,732
I don't understand.

827
01:20:06,902 --> 01:20:08,927
<i>Be brave.</i>

828
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:12,039
<i>Be very brave...</i>

829
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:16,701
<i>...and the starin the snowflake
will return.</i>

830
01:20:16,879 --> 01:20:20,509
You mean there's a chance
my nose will light up again?

831
01:20:21,717 --> 01:20:23,742
<i>Be brave.</i>

832
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:28,423
<i>Be very brave.</i>

833
01:20:30,192 --> 01:20:33,287
No! Don't go!

834
01:20:35,431 --> 01:20:37,957
Alone again.

835
01:20:41,403 --> 01:20:44,771
Rudolph, is that you up there
on the beach?

836
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:49,639
- What now?
- Out here, in the water.

837
01:20:50,379 --> 01:20:53,542
Big Ben, the clockwork whale.

838
01:20:53,716 --> 01:20:56,549
Remember me? I work for Father Time.

839
01:20:56,719 --> 01:21:00,246
Sure, I remember.
What are you doing here?

840
01:21:00,422 --> 01:21:03,619
Strangest thing. Like I was led to you.

841
01:21:03,792 --> 01:21:07,888
I was under the water, following
the glow of the northern lights.

842
01:21:08,063 --> 01:21:11,260
<i>Came up to get a good look
and there you were.</i>

843
01:21:11,433 --> 01:21:14,960
Oh, Ben, I've got problems.

844
01:21:15,137 --> 01:21:17,538
Well, little fella, you tell them to me.

845
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:20,107
I got a big shoulder to rest your head on.

846
01:21:20,309 --> 01:21:24,268
And it's wet already,
so a few tears won't hurt.

847
01:21:25,147 --> 01:21:27,775
So you want to give me your hat?

848
01:21:27,983 --> 01:21:31,351
Only if you can turn Rudolph's
nose back on.

849
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:34,147
Why, of course I can.

850
01:21:34,323 --> 01:21:38,317
- What did you say?
- It's hardly worth it.

851
01:21:38,494 --> 01:21:40,155
It is to me.

852
01:21:40,329 --> 01:21:43,822
This hat is what keeps me all living.

853
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:47,833
- Without it--
- Oh, very well.

854
01:21:48,003 --> 01:21:50,062
I'll make the trade.

855
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:54,676
Would you say goodbye to
Crystal., Millie and Chilly for me?

856
01:21:54,843 --> 01:21:57,039
Especially Crystal.

857
01:21:57,212 --> 01:22:02,082
Oh, Crystal. If only we could
be together one more time.

858
01:22:02,251 --> 01:22:04,447
But that's impossible.

859
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:08,352
So I hope you'll remember
all the good times.

860
01:23:33,475 --> 01:23:36,240
And that's the whole story, Big Ben.

861
01:23:36,411 --> 01:23:38,140
Oh, that's terrible.

862
01:23:38,313 --> 01:23:41,010
Rudolph, you gotta get your nose back.

863
01:23:41,183 --> 01:23:46,178
I can't. If I tell the truth,
that means Frosty has to melt.

864
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:51,919
Not necessarily. No time to explain.
I gotta swim like thunder.

865
01:23:55,564 --> 01:23:57,396
Where are you going?

866
01:23:57,566 --> 01:24:02,265
To South America!

867
01:24:02,571 --> 01:24:05,040
South America?

868
01:24:06,241 --> 01:24:10,405
Now. Give me your hat!

869
01:24:19,021 --> 01:24:21,080
What's going on here?

870
01:24:21,256 --> 01:24:24,590
The poor frozen fool gave me his hat...

871
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:27,922
...when I promised to return your nose.

872
01:24:28,096 --> 01:24:30,531
You know you can't do that.

873
01:24:30,699 --> 01:24:34,761
Yes, I know. But he didn't.

874
01:24:37,039 --> 01:24:40,441
Okay, Winterbolt. You asked for it.

875
01:24:40,609 --> 01:24:43,909
You've got to catch me first!

876
01:24:53,822 --> 01:24:55,620
Frosty?

877
01:24:55,791 --> 01:25:00,729
Frosty? Frosty, where are you?

878
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:03,793
Oh, no!

879
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:06,833
No.

880
01:25:07,803 --> 01:25:09,794
Don't look, children.

881
01:25:20,515 --> 01:25:22,449
Come on out from there.

882
01:25:22,751 --> 01:25:24,776
I know where you're hiding.

883
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:26,682
Come and get me.

884
01:25:27,089 --> 01:25:30,423
Okay, I will!

885
01:25:34,596 --> 01:25:36,724
Surprise!

886
01:25:37,933 --> 01:25:39,458
Surprise!

887
01:26:00,656 --> 01:26:04,684
You don't frighten me.
The hat is mine!

888
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:06,919
Try and get it.

889
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:16,499
Hey!

890
01:26:18,073 --> 01:26:21,941
Oh, no. No! It's impossible!

891
01:26:22,344 --> 01:26:27,305
It's like Lady Boreal said.

892
01:26:28,884 --> 01:26:30,909
It's back for good.

893
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:39,222
I warn you! I warn you!

894
01:26:39,394 --> 01:26:42,887
I will not be defeated!

895
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:53,538
Oh, Daddy.

896
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:57,646
But-- But can't he get
another hat, Mommy?

897
01:26:57,946 --> 01:27:02,042
Children, remember him as he was.

898
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:06,313
Poor roly-poly little son of a gun.

899
01:27:06,488 --> 01:27:09,719
All right, all you jerks. Clear out of here!

900
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:11,620
Show's mine now.

901
01:27:11,793 --> 01:27:13,784
Not so fast!

902
01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:19,697
Hey, you got your beak back.

903
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:22,268
That's not all we've got back.

904
01:27:22,437 --> 01:27:24,599
Go ahead, officer.

905
01:27:24,773 --> 01:27:26,764
Here's your money. Mrs. Loraine.

906
01:27:26,942 --> 01:27:29,036
Rudolph was tricked into taking it.

907
01:27:29,211 --> 01:27:31,578
He's innocent as a newborn babe.

908
01:27:31,747 --> 01:27:34,307
Well, I'll be blasted.

909
01:27:34,483 --> 01:27:36,850
One other thing.

910
01:27:37,786 --> 01:27:40,687
Rudolph risked his life to get this back.

911
01:27:42,023 --> 01:27:43,616
For you, sir.

912
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:54,698
Happy birthday.

913
01:27:57,072 --> 01:28:00,406
- What are we celebrating?
- You!

914
01:28:00,575 --> 01:28:03,567
Oh, good idea.

915
01:28:05,714 --> 01:28:09,514
Here's your dough.
The circus is still mine.

916
01:28:09,684 --> 01:28:12,847
- I'll be taking that.
- Why?

917
01:28:13,655 --> 01:28:16,886
You won't be needing it in jail.

918
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:20,956
Oh, Rudolph, we're so sorry
for the way we acted.

919
01:28:21,263 --> 01:28:22,890
What can we do to make it up?

920
01:28:24,199 --> 01:28:26,099
It wasn't your fault.

921
01:28:26,334 --> 01:28:28,894
Gee. Thanks. Rudolph.

922
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:32,740
Thank you, You gave everything
you had for me.

923
01:28:32,908 --> 01:28:35,343
Well, didn't you give everything for me?

924
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:38,878
I mean, us misfits gotta stick together.

925
01:28:39,047 --> 01:28:41,379
Put it there, pal.

926
01:30:14,309 --> 01:30:18,610
Not so fast. I still have my scepter.

927
01:30:19,114 --> 01:30:22,277
Destruction to you all!

928
01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:24,942
This one looks like my job.

929
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,851
But, Mama, there are only blanks
in those guns.

930
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:31,658
Yeah, but the guns are made of iron.

931
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:37,023
No. No!

932
01:30:37,198 --> 01:30:40,657
My-- My powers are gone!

933
01:30:40,869 --> 01:30:44,703
When the scepter dies. I go too.

934
01:30:44,873 --> 01:30:48,707
I turn, I turn, turn...

935
01:30:49,177 --> 01:30:51,202
I turn...

936
01:30:51,379 --> 01:30:53,438
...into a...

937
01:30:53,615 --> 01:30:56,175
...tree.

938
01:31:01,656 --> 01:31:03,988
What an exit!

939
01:31:08,563 --> 01:31:12,363
Mama, the storm's gone!

940
01:31:12,534 --> 01:31:15,526
Like a miracle.

941
01:31:15,704 --> 01:31:19,197
Now we can be to the shore
in a few minutes.

942
01:31:19,374 --> 01:31:20,705
Up! Up!

943
01:31:21,343 --> 01:31:24,313
Dash away, all!

944
01:31:29,217 --> 01:31:31,743
Well, our troubles are over.

945
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,217
Kind of dull, huh?

946
01:31:33,388 --> 01:31:36,358
Well, I'm glad old Winterbolt's
powers are gone.

947
01:31:36,591 --> 01:31:38,252
<i>Me too.</i>

948
01:31:38,426 --> 01:31:41,589
- Hey, wait a minute!
- What is it, Blinky?

949
01:31:41,763 --> 01:31:47,725
If all his powers are gone, that means
those amulets are no good either.

950
01:31:47,902 --> 01:31:50,269
Frosty! Crystal!

951
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:58,036
Laine, what happened?

952
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:03,576
Well, the sun came out and they just--

953
01:32:03,752 --> 01:32:05,311
<i>Look!</i>

954
01:32:10,925 --> 01:32:13,121
Gee whiz!

955
01:32:14,696 --> 01:32:17,757
After all we went through.

956
01:32:17,932 --> 01:32:21,891
I should have realized, it's too late now.

957
01:32:22,203 --> 01:32:24,331
When Frosty melts, nothing can help...

958
01:32:24,506 --> 01:32:27,737
...except a magic December wind
to unmelt him.

959
01:32:27,909 --> 01:32:30,173
And this is July!

960
01:32:30,345 --> 01:32:35,613
Yeah. Well, where we gonna find
a Christmas wind in July?

961
01:32:35,784 --> 01:32:38,515
Right here!

962
01:32:40,955 --> 01:32:43,720
And I brought Jack Frost with me.

963
01:32:44,025 --> 01:32:45,618
Hey, Rudolph!

964
01:32:45,794 --> 01:32:47,455
How'd you do it, Ben?

965
01:32:47,629 --> 01:32:49,825
Had to go all the way to South America.

966
01:32:50,031 --> 01:32:53,365
That's where winter goes in July.

967
01:32:54,369 --> 01:32:56,167
Jack Frost...

968
01:32:56,337 --> 01:32:58,271
...do your stuff!

969
01:32:59,507 --> 01:33:01,475
I've got to aim real carefully...

970
01:33:01,643 --> 01:33:05,102
...or I'll give colds to all the kids
on the beach.

971
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:07,647
Well, here goes.

972
01:33:18,393 --> 01:33:20,862
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

973
01:33:22,831 --> 01:33:25,994
Come on, gang. Let's dig them out.

974
01:33:26,167 --> 01:33:28,295
Keep that cold breath on them. Jack.

975
01:33:28,503 --> 01:33:30,130
<i>Look!</i>

976
01:33:33,808 --> 01:33:36,334
Great jumping geraniums!

977
01:33:36,511 --> 01:33:40,914
Santa Claus is finally coming to town!

978
01:33:46,721 --> 01:33:50,851
Papa, we'd better get going
before Jack runs out of breath.

979
01:33:51,192 --> 01:33:54,890
I'll stick with the show, sir,
until they're out of debt.

980
01:33:55,063 --> 01:33:58,658
They should be out of debt real soon.

981
01:34:00,201 --> 01:34:05,469
I gave Lilly some of my magic corn feed.

982
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:08,041
The kind that makes animals fly.

983
01:34:09,611 --> 01:34:15,345
A circus by the sea is one thing,
but a flying circus by the sea...

984
01:34:15,517 --> 01:34:19,818
- Daddy. Daddy! Can we stay and see it?
- Daddy. Daddy! Can we stay and see it?

985
01:34:19,988 --> 01:34:22,082
Oh, Frosty, could they?

986
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:26,051
No deal. Enough's enough.

987
01:34:29,764 --> 01:34:32,426
Then let's get going!

988
01:34:33,301 --> 01:34:35,531
Away!

989
01:34:47,849 --> 01:34:51,444
Gee. I kind of miss not being with Santa.

990
01:34:51,619 --> 01:34:56,056
Blinky, you wanna lead something
through the sky, you got it!

991
01:34:56,224 --> 01:34:58,784
- What?
- Forget the sleigh!

992
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:01,622
It's time for the flying circus parade.

993
01:35:01,796 --> 01:35:04,163
With you right up front.

994
01:35:04,332 --> 01:35:06,391
Okay!

995
01:36:59,714 --> 01:37:01,705
