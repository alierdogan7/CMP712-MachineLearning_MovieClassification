529
00:22:54,621 --> 00:22:56,488
It's for throwing.

530
00:22:56,523 --> 00:22:58,490
I'm meeting someone,
Jerry.

531
00:22:58,525 --> 00:22:59,792
Manny Azenberg.

532
00:22:59,826 --> 00:23:01,360
I bumped into him
this afternoon.

533
00:23:01,394 --> 00:23:02,795
He told me you were
having dinner

534
00:23:02,829 --> 00:23:05,631
to talk about
this "Marilyn" thing.

535
00:23:05,665 --> 00:23:07,099
I said there had to be
some mistake,

536
00:23:07,133 --> 00:23:09,368
because you and I
were having dinner.

537
00:23:09,402 --> 00:23:11,537
Oh, for goodness sake.

538
00:23:11,571 --> 00:23:14,673
Eileen.
Have dinner with me.

539
00:23:14,707 --> 00:23:16,542
I'm not having dinner
with you.

540
00:23:16,576 --> 00:23:19,278
- You're divorcing me.
- You're divorcing me.

541
00:23:19,312 --> 00:23:20,712
Yes, I am.
Go back to your blondes.

542
00:23:20,747 --> 00:23:21,880
Oh, they're boring.

543
00:23:21,915 --> 00:23:24,183
They all blend together.

544
00:23:24,217 --> 00:23:27,953
You never do.

545
00:23:27,987 --> 00:23:30,656
You like the earrings?

546
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:34,226
They're lovely.
You have exquisite taste.

547
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,061
When you weren't
cheating on me,

548
00:23:36,095 --> 00:23:39,298
it was one of the things
I really enjoyed about you.

549
00:23:39,332 --> 00:23:44,303
I saw them in the window
of a little boutique in Soho.

550
00:23:44,337 --> 00:23:45,971
[Sighs]

551
00:23:46,005 --> 00:23:50,008
They look so much like you.

552
00:23:50,043 --> 00:23:52,344
Come here.

553
00:23:52,378 --> 00:23:53,478
- Don't even...
- Come here.

554
00:23:53,513 --> 00:23:57,416
Try touching me.

555
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,668
Fine.

556
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:04,089
Look, Manny is, in fact,
interested in <i>Marilyn.</i>

557
00:24:04,123 --> 00:24:06,024
He's ready to come in.

558
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:08,660
[Laughs]
He hasn't even seen the specs.

559
00:24:08,695 --> 00:24:11,263
I was gonna walk him
through them tonight.

560
00:24:11,297 --> 00:24:13,665
Eileen, I talked to him.
He's in.

561
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,167
Oh, for crying out loud.

562
00:24:15,201 --> 00:24:16,902
What do you think
you're doing?

563
00:24:16,936 --> 00:24:19,371
I think I'm helping you
get your musical produced.

564
00:24:19,405 --> 00:24:20,739
That's what I thought
you thought you were doing,

565
00:24:20,773 --> 00:24:22,174
but you know what?

566
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,525
That's not
what you're doing.

567
00:24:23,576 --> 00:24:26,211
One of the last great
theater producers

568
00:24:26,246 --> 00:24:29,281
has signed on
to your little... musical.

569
00:24:29,315 --> 00:24:30,682
Because of me.

570
00:24:30,717 --> 00:24:33,418
You know those earrings
you made fun of?

571
00:24:33,453 --> 00:24:34,853
Well, clearly you thought

572
00:24:34,888 --> 00:24:36,889
someone else
had bought them for me.

573
00:24:36,923 --> 00:24:38,457
And that's what
pissed you off.

574
00:24:38,491 --> 00:24:40,225
And that's what this
is all about.

575
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,362
Mm... come on.

576
00:24:43,396 --> 00:24:47,366
I bought them myself,
Jerry.

577
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,401
I bought those earrings
for myself.

578
00:24:49,435 --> 00:24:51,436
And you know what?

579
00:24:51,471 --> 00:24:56,475
This is my musical,
and I am producing it by myself.

580
00:24:58,278 --> 00:25:02,147
[Clears throat]

581
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:10,657
This is great. I didn't even
know it was back here.

582
00:25:10,692 --> 00:25:12,943
And the food is amazing.

583
00:25:12,977 --> 00:25:14,578
So, how are things
at <i>Heaven on earth?</i>

584
00:25:14,612 --> 00:25:16,446
Fine. Terrific.

585
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:18,682
It's such a fun show
to do every night.

586
00:25:18,716 --> 00:25:20,250
I know your contract
is coming up.

587
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,169
Well, yeah.

588
00:25:22,203 --> 00:25:23,921
Unfortunately, I don't have
a clue about the running costs,

589
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:25,022
so I don't know what
they're gonna be offering

590
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:26,423
by way of a bump.

591
00:25:26,457 --> 00:25:28,058
But I know everyone
wants you to stay,

592
00:25:28,092 --> 00:25:29,593
and hopes you will stay.

593
00:25:29,627 --> 00:25:31,528
I-I don't need a...

594
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:34,298
That's not why
I asked you to lunch.

595
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:35,432
It's not?

596
00:25:35,466 --> 00:25:36,967
No.

597
00:25:37,001 --> 00:25:40,637
Actually, I was...

598
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:45,642
I was asking you on a date.

599
00:25:45,676 --> 00:25:47,811
A date.

600
00:25:47,845 --> 00:25:49,913
Yes.

601
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,748
I was feeling
kind of shy about it.

602
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:53,066
But Ivy...

603
00:25:53,117 --> 00:25:54,651
You know, she told me
to go for it.

604
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:56,620
And I thought, "why not?"

605
00:25:56,654 --> 00:25:58,088
She's dating Derek Wills.

606
00:25:58,122 --> 00:26:01,074
Why shouldn't I...

607
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:05,295
Ivy is dating
Derek Wills?

608
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:08,031
It's not actually
a secret.

609
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,767
They're having sex
in the dressing room.

610
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:15,072
Really?

611
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:16,556
It is completely unethical.

612
00:26:16,591 --> 00:26:18,008
People have sex
all the time, Tom.

613
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:19,743
It is hardly
considered unethical.

614
00:26:19,777 --> 00:26:21,511
He is taking
advantage of her.

615
00:26:21,545 --> 00:26:22,679
Maybe Ivy's
taking advantage of him.

616
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,181
She did get the part.

617
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:26,733
She got the part
because she was fantastic.

618
00:26:26,768 --> 00:26:28,785
And sleeping with the director
probably didn't hurt either.

619
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,821
[Scoffs]
That's ridiculous.

620
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:32,923
And by the way,
it proves my point.

621
00:26:32,957 --> 00:26:34,157
I don't think it does.

622
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:36,076
It's show business.

623
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,195
In shows, people...

624
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:41,632
They sleep together.
It happens. It just happens.

625
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,867
So, you don't care.

626
00:26:43,901 --> 00:26:44,968
Of course I care.

627
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,970
I guess I just don't judge.

628
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:50,090
[Scoffs]
Well... I do!

629
00:26:50,124 --> 00:26:52,843
Oh, come on.
Don't walk away.

630
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:55,095
Come on! Tom!

631
00:26:55,129 --> 00:26:58,181
- Hi.
- Oh, Ellis...

632
00:26:58,216 --> 00:26:59,383
I didn't know
that you were here.

633
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:01,385
I was just
straightening up.

634
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:03,353
He sounds really upset.

635
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,222
- Yes, he is. Excuse me.
- Can I just... I'm sorry.

636
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:07,024
What is it?

637
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,358
I just feel like
maybe you should

638
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:11,128
give him a little space
right now.

639
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:13,664
Well, I think that
I don't need Tom's assistant

640
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:16,166
explaining to me
how to handle him.

641
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,069
You know what?
I'm gonna get you a cup of tea.

642
00:27:19,103 --> 00:27:21,571
No, I don't need you
to make me a cup of tea.

643
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:23,156
What I really need...

644
00:27:23,207 --> 00:27:25,075
Actually,
you know what I need?

645
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:28,545
Is for you to go.

646
00:27:28,579 --> 00:27:29,546
Can you go?

647
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,314
Tom is upset,

648
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:34,351
and he and I have a few things
that we need to work out,

649
00:27:34,385 --> 00:27:37,187
and we're gonna
need privacy to do it.

650
00:27:37,221 --> 00:27:40,090
But I don't work for you.
I work for Tom.

651
00:27:40,124 --> 00:27:41,992
You can't actually just order me
to leave his apartment

652
00:27:42,026 --> 00:27:44,728
because I don't
work for you.

653
00:27:44,762 --> 00:27:46,163
Listen...

654
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:47,831
You should be careful
about what you say next.

655
00:27:47,865 --> 00:27:52,152
You have a real problem
with your temper, you know that?

656
00:27:52,186 --> 00:27:55,238
I fired you once.
I can do it again.

657
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,207
You can sure try.

658
00:27:57,241 --> 00:27:59,109
And then we'll see
if it sticks,

659
00:27:59,143 --> 00:28:00,610
because it kinda didn't
the last time.

660
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:03,113
Did it?

661
00:28:03,147 --> 00:28:06,016
I'm really glad
we cleared the air.

662
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,000
Oh, and you know what?

663
00:28:07,034 --> 00:28:09,252
I found your notebook.

664
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:11,204
It was underneath Tom's mail,
and he looked all over for it.

665
00:28:11,255 --> 00:28:15,759
And I knew you were
really worried about it, so...

666
00:28:15,793 --> 00:28:17,728
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

667
00:28:21,006 --> 00:28:22,106
- Oh, my God, there she is.
- Oh, my God!

668
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,390
Hi!

669
00:28:23,425 --> 00:28:25,342
Karen Cartwright,
Broadway baby!

670
00:28:25,376 --> 00:28:26,343
Excuse me.

671
00:28:26,378 --> 00:28:27,945
[Laughter]

672
00:28:27,979 --> 00:28:29,396
Sorry.

673
00:28:29,431 --> 00:28:30,981
- Hi!
- Hi! Thank you.

674
00:28:31,016 --> 00:28:33,767
Oh, baby. My baby.
[Laughs]

675
00:28:33,819 --> 00:28:35,686
- Hi.
- Amy. You look so pretty.

676
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,154
Oh, my gosh.

677
00:28:37,189 --> 00:28:39,790
That was a fast one
you pulled on me, Manny.

678
00:28:39,825 --> 00:28:42,059
Standing me up yesterday.

679
00:28:42,093 --> 00:28:44,962
Jerry wants something,
he can be pretty persuasive.

680
00:28:44,996 --> 00:28:49,700
Yes, well, we're here now.
Let me run you through this.

681
00:28:49,734 --> 00:28:52,303
Our Marilyn is a terrific
musical theater actress

682
00:28:52,337 --> 00:28:54,839
by the name of Ivy Lynn.

683
00:28:54,873 --> 00:28:57,474
She's a completely
thrilling talent.

684
00:28:57,509 --> 00:29:00,044
- She did a year in <i>wicked.</i>
- Yeah.

685
00:29:00,078 --> 00:29:04,014
I heard you're going to
do this without a star.

686
00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:05,983
Well, I'm glad to hear
people are talking about us.

687
00:29:06,017 --> 00:29:07,551
Who'd you hear
that from, Manny?

688
00:29:07,586 --> 00:29:11,388
Who do you think?

689
00:29:11,423 --> 00:29:12,723
Let me run you
through this.

690
00:29:12,757 --> 00:29:14,692
Jerry already did.

691
00:29:14,726 --> 00:29:15,960
Jerry isn't
producing this with me.

692
00:29:15,994 --> 00:29:17,228
Well, when he is,
let me know.

693
00:29:17,262 --> 00:29:20,231
[Clears throat]
No disrespect, Eileen.

694
00:29:20,265 --> 00:29:22,066
But I'm just
more comfortable

695
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,736
dealing with him
on the business side.

696
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,671
He wants to support you?

697
00:29:27,706 --> 00:29:29,740
Your boyfriend
sounds awesome.

698
00:29:29,774 --> 00:29:32,009
He is awesome, but I don't
want him supporting me.

699
00:29:32,043 --> 00:29:34,511
You know,
feminism's overrated.

700
00:29:34,546 --> 00:29:36,714
- What does that mean?
- It means don't be an idiot.

701
00:29:36,748 --> 00:29:39,416
It is awesome your boyfriend
wants to support you.

702
00:29:39,451 --> 00:29:42,152
And half our class
is already married.

703
00:29:42,187 --> 00:29:43,187
