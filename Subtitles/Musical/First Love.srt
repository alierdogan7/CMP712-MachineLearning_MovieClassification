[Woman]
And so, the pages turn,

2
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,654
and your school days are over.

3
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:41,928
To you, they have been
a small, and we hope,
happy lifetime.

4
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:46,028
But to us, they've been more
like the miracle of a minute.

5
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:50,133
The mischievous, loving children
who came to us four years ago...

6
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,805
now leave us
as charming young ladies,

7
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,872
to face the challenge of life,

8
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,044
with all the happiness
and victories...

9
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,817
and even the disappointments
it has in store for you.

10
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:08,520
No senior class
has ever set a higher standard
for succeeding ones to follow,

11
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,563
and I only hope that now,

12
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,793
when you go home
to friends and family,

13
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:18,861
you will carry with you
all the courage and idealism...

14
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:22,203
and the sportsmanship
that have made us all...

15
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:25,676
so proud to be associated
with this graduating class.

16
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:30,176
Good-bye, girls.

17
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,913
Good luck.
God bless you.

21
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,721
I can't find mine either.

22
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:18,457
You'd think they'd have
sense enough to stay put.
There they are!
Connie!

23
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,624
You've got to meet
Mother and Dad.

24
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:24,102
Mother, Dad,
this is Connie.

25
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,105
We're so glad
to meet you, after all
Marcia has written.

26
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,107
She gave you
quite a buildup.
Oh.

27
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:32,167
Well, look at her.
She's tops. And you
ought to hear her sing.

28
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:35,908
When she hits
a high note, it sends chills
up and down your back.

29
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:39,076
Where are your father
and mother, Connie?
We'd like to meet them.

30
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:42,383
My parents are dead,
Mr. Parker.
Oh. I'm sorry.

31
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:45,982
Mother, I have a wonderful idea.
Why can't Connie come with us
and spend the summer?

32
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,391
Could you, Connie?
We'd be so pleased.

33
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:52,363
It's very kind of you,
but I have an aunt
and uncle in New York.

34
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:55,890
I'm going to live with them.
It's all been arranged that way.

35
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,529
Her uncle is
James F. Clinton.
You know him, Dad.

36
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:02,598
I owe everything
to UncleJim... this school,
my music, everything.

37
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,405
- I couldn't disappoint him.
- No, of course not.

38
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:09,073
Jim Clinton, eh?
Well, you're a lucky girl.
He's a fine man.

39
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:12,276
- Yes, he is.
- Isn't it his daughter
we read so much about?

40
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,947
Yes, that's Barbara.
She's a year older than I am.
Oh, and she's beautiful.

41
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:18,547
Did you see her picture
in the magazine?

42
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,025
Miss Constance Harding?
Yes.

43
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,427
I'm Mr. Clinton's butler.
We've called for you in the car.

44
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:27,728
Then they're here!
Excuse me, please.
Oh, no!

45
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,429
They're not here.
I'm sorry, but only the
chauffeur and I are here.

46
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,505
They didn't come?
No, miss, they
were very busy.

47
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:40,102
Of course.
They couldn't leave
New York, could they?

48
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:43,046
No, miss.
[Quietly]
Well.

49
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,676
I'll be back
in a few minutes.
Very good, miss.

50
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:49,085
If you'd be so kind
as to show me where
the car is, please.

51
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:53,057
That's the car over there,
miss. The black car
with the white wheels.

52
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,462
I'll go and get my bag.
Very good, miss.

53
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:03,467
Connie. Connie.!
They didn't come?

54
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,902
No.
Oh, Connie,
change your mind.

55
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,941
Spend the summer
with us on the lake.
We have a houseboat.

56
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:12,910
I'd love to, Marcia, but
they've done so much for me,
you know?

57
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:21,282
Connie, when you go
to New York, there's a boy...
Sally, I have to hurry.

58
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,652
Where do you think
you're going?
I have to change.

59
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,851
You promised to sing.
Toni, I can't, really.

60
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,258
What do you think of that?
She refuses to sing.

61
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:33,095

Let's go to the music room.
Come on!

63
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,901
Yes?
What is it?

64
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:40,029
May we use the piano,
Miss Wiggins?
What for?

65
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:43,200
Connie's gonna sing for us.

66
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,267
All right.
Go ahead.

67
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,870
Miss Wiggins says
it's all right.
Come on!

68
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:51,405
The leader of the glee club
always sings the last song.
They're waiting outside...

69
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,782
I don't feel like singing.
Oh, temperamental, eh?

70
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,787
No, I'm not.
What'll it be,
girls?

71
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,949
[Chattering]
Anything you like.

72
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,358
"Home, Sweet Home" for instance.
What about the one
you sang the other day?

73
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:04,362
All right.

00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:19,976
Mid pleasures

75
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:25,040

00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,391
So humble

79
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:45,904
There's no place

80
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:50,375
Like home

81
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:58,316
A charm from the skies

82
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:07,952
Seems to hallow us there

83
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:16,492
Which seek
through the world

84
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:26,240
Is ne'er met with
elsewhere

85
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:35,852
Home, home

86
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:44,193
Sweet, sweet home

87
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:54,935
There's no place
like home

88
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:04,648
Connie.
What is it, Connie?

89
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,446
That's funny.
Connie never cries.

90
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,546
I'm sorry.

91
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,591
Don't you feel well?

92
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,953
Get out.
Go on. Out.

93
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:27,232
What's all this?

94
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,642
Look up here.

95
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:38,144
What's the matter
with you?
Nothing.

96
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:43,416
It's just that
everybody's going home, and...

97
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:46,822
And?
And I'm leaving mine.

98
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,129
I thought so.

99
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,858
Crying your eyes out...

100
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:56,265
just because
you don't have a home
of your own to go to.

101
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:59,862
Or a mother and father
to tell you how pretty
and clever you are.

102
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:03,306
Ohh. Poor little thing.

103
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:07,369
You've just got a voice
that comes to one in a million.

104
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:12,179
Straight from God to you...
to you alone.

105
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,742
And you sit there
feeling sorry for yourself.

106
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,152
Yes, you are!
Sorry for yourself!

107
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:22,217
If I were that kind of girl, you
know what I'd do? I'd stick my
tongue out at myself, like that.

108
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,834
Get away. What's all this?
You've been so wonderful
to me, Miss Wiggins.

109
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,671
You go on up there
to New York...

110
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:45,012
and make those people love you
as much as we do.

111
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,747
And then, maybe someday,
you'll meet a prince,

112
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:52,052
and you'll live
happily ever after, hmm?

113
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:56,185
Those fairy stories
haven't come true for over
a hundred years, Miss Wiggins.

114
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,397
Fiddlesticks!

115
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:02,798
You just have
to dust 'em off,
streamline 'em a bit.

116
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:06,360
They'd still be
fairy stories, wouldn't they?
That's all life is.

117
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:10,933
A fairy story. The trouble
with you young people is you
don't believe in anything.

118
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,878
You're afraid...
afraid of hope,
afraid of happiness.

119
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,508
What's New York?
It's just another town.
It's no bigger than you are.

120
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:22,520
Go there and laugh in it,
love in it, live in it!
Make it yours!

121
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,300
Hold it,
Miss Clinton.

122
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,603
Thank you.

123
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,832
Blue Boy!
Hold it,
Miss Clinton.

124
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,841
Thank you.
Blue Boy, come on!

125
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,512
Hold it, Miss Clinton.
Thank you.

126
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:52,377
Hold it,
Miss Clinton.
Thank you.

127
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:58,847
Isn't that wonderful?
Right in the middle of the air.
What's wonderful about it?

128
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,721
It's like
you were a bird.
It's terrible.

129
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,591
Throw that bathing suit out.
It looks like a flour sack.
Yes, miss.

130
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,597
Get my comb.
Yes, miss.

131
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,998
Send that editor a telegram
telling him he's a darling
for putting me on the cover.

132
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:13,004
May I fix that spangle?
You should have done it
before I put the dress on.

133
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:16,508
It wasn't loose then.
Well, hurry up.
Comb these curls out. OIlie!

134
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:20,272
Just one more!
Can you hold just
a little still, please?

135
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,440
Give me that comb.
You can pull on it.
It won't come off.

136
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,917
I didn't want to hurt you.
Get my perfume,
the Clair de Lune Bleu.

137
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,920
Yes, miss.
Is Mother ready?

138
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,922
I got her done
an hour ago.
What's she wearing?

139
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,924
A new one
from Hendricks.
What's it like?

140
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:36,291
You don't have to worry.
It's nothing like yours.
Which one did you say?

141
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,523
Clair de Lune Bleu.
[Mispronounces]
Clair de Lune Blee.

142
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,657
Bleu. Bleu!
Blue. Blur!

143
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,897
That isn't right,
but you're getting warm.
Oh, thank you, miss.

144
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,268
Here's your coat,
Miss Barbara.
Bring it along.

145
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,570
Which flowers would you like?
I don't care.
Any of them.

146
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,611
These would look nice on you.

147
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:55,203
They're terrible.
Give me the gardenias.
Yes, Miss Barbara.

148
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,114
Call me at noon tomorrow
and be sure that I get up.
Yes, Miss Barbara.

149
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:02,314
And call that Swedish girl...
foot massage in the morning.
You shouldn't dance so much.

150
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,322
If Mr. Warrington calls,
tell him to call back.

151
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,881
If Mr. Patton calls,
tell him I have smallpox.

152
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,553
Yes, miss.
A headache
for Mr. Patton.

153
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,892
Where's my bag?
Oh, I forgot it.

154
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:14,432
Well, get it.

155
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,867
Mother! I'm ready!
Where's Mother, Walter?

156
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,303
Are you ready?
All but one cuff link.

157
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:24,604
Mother, please!
Oh, my darling child.

158
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:29,171
You look so sweet!
And that color's
so good for you too.

159
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:33,048
Or maybe you're good
for the color. I always say
the woman makes the clothes...

160
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,713
Let's get started, hmm?
Even Walter's ready.

161
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,916
Ready and rarin' to go.
We can't go
for quite a while yet.

162
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,925
Oh, good.
What's
the matter now?

163
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:44,019
George and Terry aren't back
with your cousin yet.
They have the car.

164
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,189
Let's take one of
the other cars.
Which one?

165
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:50,725
The sedan is waiting for
your father at his office;
my town car's in the garage;

166
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:54,671
and the big town car
we can't use because the
second chauffeur's off today.

167
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,699
You know, the one who was born
in February. What's his name?
Nick, for Nicholas.

168
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:03,545
I can't be more than an hour
and a half late for Wilma's party!
She's one of my personal friends.

169
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,210
Why did that child
have to graduate today?

170
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,743
- Graduations are important.
- What's more important to me...

171
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,347
is that Wilma
will think I'm deliberately
sabotaging her party.

172
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:15,450
Oh, if that's
the case, perhaps we'd
better take a taxi.

173
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,463
That's idiotic.
No one can get
comfortable in a taxi.

174
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:22,558
- If you'd learn to drive, we
wouldn't have to ride in them.
- Driving is work.

175
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,968
Not as much work
as walking, perhaps,
but still work.

176
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:29,838
Walter! You came that close
to making an epigram!

177
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,036
You know...
Here they are,
Miss Barbara.

178
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,341
This one matches everything.
Doesn't match
anything.

179
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,405
Throw it out.
Now run outside and see
if you can find a taxi.

180
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:42,318
- Can you whistle, Agnes?
- You mean like this?
[Whistling]

181
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,652
Don't ever
do that, Agnes.
Well, I'm sorry...

182
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:47,021
Will you please
get that cab!
Get my coat, please.

183
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:51,358
In the future, I hope someone
will have enough sense to keep
at least one chauffeur around.

184
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,093
- [Walter] Ditto.
- [Mother] It's all
Mother's fault, I know...

185
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,829
Here they are!

186
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:59,837
Hello...
Where have you been?

187
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:02,465
I'm sorry
we're so late.
We had a flat tire.

188
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,738
On an $8,000 automobile?
Impossible!

189
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:09,440
- [Walter]
We almost had to take a taxi.
- I'm very sorry, Mr. Walter.

190
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,951
- Tell me about the flat
in the morning, Terry.
- But I thought...

191
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,852
When you're going touring again,
be sure there's somebody here
to drive for us.

192
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,584
Mrs. Clinton,
your flowers!
What's the matter with my...

193
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,592
Connie!

194
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,685
Hello.

195
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:27,789
Oh, my baby!
I'm so glad to see you!

196
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:32,804
Barbara, you haven't
said a word to Connie.
Happy you managed to get here.

197
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,433
- Walter, what have you
to say to your cousin?
- Hi.

198
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,533
- [Connie] Hello.
- [Barbara] We have to run.

199
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:42,012
I'll start your horoscope
first thing in the morning.

200
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,743
Do you
still sing?
Yes, I do.

201
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:48,275
[Muttering]
George, the minute
Mr. Clinton comes in...

202
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:51,551
By the time we get
there, there won't be
a photographer left!

203
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,559
Good-bye, Connie.
Good-bye, good-bye,
good-bye!

204
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,598
I'll show you
to your room, miss.

205
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,202
Please come this way.

206
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:11,973
What time do you think
UncleJim will be home?
You mean Mr. Clinton, miss?

207
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:15,445
Yes.
The goings
and comings of this family
are none of my affair.

208
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,972
Though I might say
if they're out,
Mr. Clinton usually is here.

209
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:22,282
If they're here,
Mr. Clinton usually is out.

210
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,280
This way, miss.

211
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,155
Here's your room, miss.

212
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,075
Shall I put
the window down, miss?

213
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:48,272
Hmm?
I said shall I
put the window down?

214
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:51,908
No, thank you.
It's all right.
May I help you unpack, miss?

215
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:55,112
I think I can do it
myself, thank you.
Will there be anything else?

216
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,121
No, thank you.
Very well, miss.

217
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:00,420
There'll be a light supper
served in the dining room
as soon as you are ready.

218
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:03,723
- No, thank you.
- But surely you'll
want something.

219
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,696
I don't feel like eating.

220
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:08,324
Very well, miss.

221
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:59,184
Pardon me, miss.
Is supper all ready?

222
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,845
You certainly do things
quickly around here.

223
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,582
I thought you said...
I'll be down
as soon as I've changed.

224
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:07,523
Certainly.
And don't make that supper
too light. I'm famished!

225
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,696
Some more
chicken, miss?
Oh, I couldn't, really.

226
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,698
Are you sure, miss?
Oh, yes.

227
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:18,260
Very good, miss.
There is another
little piece of white meat.

228
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,771
Yes, there is
another little piece
of white meat, miss.

229
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,864
I know what
you're thinking.
I hope not, miss.

230
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:26,468
You're wondering if
I always change my mind.
I'll get your hot chocolate.

231
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,537
I don't want any,
thank you.
Will that be all then?

232
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,583
Mm-hmm.
Very good, miss.

233
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:38,779
Do you think if one makes up
one's mind about doing something
that really helps one to do it?

234
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:42,554
Indubitably, miss.
I made up my mind that I like
this house and everybody in it.

235
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:45,756
- And everybody in it's
going to like me.
- Cheerful thought, miss.

236
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:49,699
They didn't have to have me
come live with them if they
didn't want me.
No, miss.

237
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:53,067
UncleJim asked me to come.
So Mrs. Clinton
told me.

238
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:57,006
Don't you ever smile?
I'm sorry, miss,
but if I may say so,

239
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,510
gay butlers
are a trifle rare.

240
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,109
Do you like singing?

241
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:06,413
Yes, I do, miss,
and no, I don't,
if you know what I mean.

242
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:09,181
I'm sorry.
Either you do
or you don't.

243
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,518
It's this way, miss.
Some people consider...

244
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:16,118
Boop-boop dittem
dattem wattem chu
...an inspiring cantata.

245
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:19,790
My preference is for
something above that.
Oh.

246
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,924
I'm sorry, miss.

247
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,763
I'm sorry too.

248
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:30,598
[Humming]

249
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:35,636
De amor escuche
la triste queja

250
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:40,708
De amor que sono
en mi corazon

251
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:48,886
Diciendome asi
con su dulce cancion

252
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:53,455
Amapola

253
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:56,262
Lindisima Amapola

254
00:18:56,335 --> 00:19:02,740
Sera siempre mi alma
tuya sola

255
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:08,144
Yo te quiero
amada linda mia

256
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,681
Igual que ama
la flor

257
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:14,082
A la luz del dia

258
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,247
Amapola

259
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,756
Lindisima Amapola

260
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:27,163
No seas tan ingrata, amame

261
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:33,694
Amapola

262
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:37,003
Amapola

263
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:43,844
Como puedes tu vivir

264
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:48,080
Amapola

265
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:50,383
Lindisima Amapola

267
00:19:55,627 --> 00:20:00,155
Yo te quiero

Amapola

270
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,536
Lindisima Amapola

271
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,042
No seas tan ingrata

272
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:16,706
Amame

273
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:23,119
Amapola

274

275
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:29,023
Como puedes tu vivir

276

Tan sola

277
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:46,611
You're Connie, huh?
Yes, UncleJim. L...

278
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:49,306
Well, what seems
to be the trouble?
It's my fault.

279
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,373
I'm very sorry, sir, but...
I thought
everybody was out.

280
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:56,285
They are out, sir.
Yes, sir.
They are? Good.

281
00:20:56,355 --> 00:21:00,086
See that there's no more noise
until they get in then.
Very well, sir.

282
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,362
[Clearing Throat]

283
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:10,768
UncleJim.
UncleJim!

284
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,770
L...

285
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:17,299
I just wanted
to thank you
for everything.

286
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:21,039
No thanks necessary.
You've done
so much for me and...

287
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,673
I signed a few checks.
Do that all the time.

288
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:27,742
My sister's child.
We always take care
of our own. Like to do it.

289
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,185
I like being here,
too, UncleJim.
You like bein' here.

290
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,519
Uh-huh.
You met
your cousins?

291
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,650
Yes.
You met your
Aunt Grace?

292
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:37,320
Yes.
And you like
bein' here?

293
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:40,422
Oh, yes.
Hmph.

294
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,433
[Muttering]
She likes bein' here.

295
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,703
Is there anything
you want before you
go to bed, child?

296
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,238
We've got a big watermelon
in the icebox.

297
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:02,117
No, thank you.
Don't start taking them
too seriously, miss.

298
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,883
You'll get used to them.
Sure. We did.

299
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:10,088
Good night.
Good night, miss.
Pleasant dreams.

300
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:23,939
Good afternoon,
Miss Barbara. I've been
waiting for you to wake up.

301
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,240
Your pictures are in
all the morning papers.

302
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:30,338
What time is it?
It's a little after 2:00.

303
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:34,681
Which kind? I brought
orange juice, tomato,
grapefruit and grape.

304
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:38,519
Sauerkraut.
Oh, I never seem
to be able to guess.

305
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,718
I might have known
you'd be in the mood
for sauerkraut today.

306
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:44,091
When Mr. Drake called,
I told him...

307
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:46,562
Who called?
Mr. Drake.
He called twice.

308
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:49,862
Why didn't you wake me up?
I tried to,
both times.

309
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:53,268
- You did not.
- Oh, yes, I did.
The pillow the first time.

310
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:55,465
You threw the alarm clock
the second time.

311
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,134
Where'd he call from?
Right here. Just
got back in town.

312
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,940
- What'd he say?
- He wanted you to go riding...

313
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:04,277
with he and Miss Flourney
and Miss Van Everett
and a lot of people.

314
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:07,944
They were leaving
at 2:30 sharp.
I'll never get there by 2:30.

315
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:09,953
Couldn't you telephone him
and ask him to wait?

316
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:11,955
And make him think
I'm running after him?

317
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:14,992
I'd run after him.
Papers say he's the catch
of the season.

318
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,154
If I could only stop him
from leaving 'til I get there.
I have an idea.

319
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,529
If you'd called me
when he phoned, you
wouldn't need any ideas.

320
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,797
It's a good idea,
really it is.
I'm sure it is.

321
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:29,273
I could hurry out to the club,
see Mr. Drake and faint.
Have these shined.

322
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:32,105
I could throw myself
under his horse's hooves.

323
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:35,237
I wouldn't mind
doing it for you...
Get that cousin of mine.

324
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:38,908
If she isn't here by the time
I count ten, you're fired.
Yes, miss!

325
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,085
Miss Connie!
What is it?

326
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:47,648
Miss Barbara wants you
this minute. Please hurry.
Yes, all right, Agnes.

327
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,192
Miss Connie'll be
right in.
Oh, I am in.

328
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,232
Oh, you are.
Never mind.

329
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:05,676
Yes, Barbara?
Some friends
of mine are going riding at
the country club in a half hour.

330
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:08,975
I want you to delay their start
'til I get there, understand?
You mean stop them?

331
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,538
- At least stop Ted Drake.
- I don't even know him.

332
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,584
You know what
he looks like.
No.

333
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:16,712
The most notable
young man in New York.
You must have seen his picture.

334
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:20,315
I don't think so.
Well, you'll find one
in that drawer.

335
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:23,486
Which one?
The top drawer.

336
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:27,293
In the dresser?
Yes. Just open it.
You'll find it.

337
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:29,697
I don't see
any picture here.

338
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:33,864
Oh, you don't see any picture.
I told you it was there.
Why don't you look for it?

339
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:37,670
- What do you think this is?
And please hurry!
- Oh, I think...

340
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:42,111
What'll I say to him?
I don't care what you say
as long as you keep him there.

341
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,410
And be sure
he doesn't know
I sent you.

342
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:48,510
- I don't think
I can do it, Barbara.
- All right, don't then.

343
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:51,681
- Oh, I mean...
- After all this family's
done for you,

344
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:54,691
the first time we ask you
to do something for us,
you refuse.

345
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:57,592
Oh, I'll do it then.
I don't know what to do.

346
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,597
Faint. Make him revive you.
Fall in front ofhim.
Steal his horse.

347
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,395
I don't care, as long as
he's there when I get there.
And hurry!

348
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,236
Off for a little stroll,
Miss Connie?
Yes. I mean no.

349
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:14,608
I'll need the car. Oh,
my hat. I left it in there.
I'll get the car.

350
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,738
- Thank you.
I'm in an awful hurry.
- [Walter] Why?

351
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:21,548
I have to stop Ted Drake's horse
at the country club for Barbara.
Oh, not his horse. Him.

352
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,214
But he'll be on it.
You know what I mean.
Perfectly.

353
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:28,089
I have to run now.
Good-bye.
Connie,
give me a cigarette, please.

354
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,753
Oh, yes.
When were you born,
Connie?

355
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:34,595
- December 4th.
- Sagittarius.
Oh, how interesting.

356
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,794
What time
of day?
I don't remember.

357
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:41,999
I'm going to do your horoscope.
Hurry back, and I'll tell you
all about yourself.

358
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:44,007
Yes, Aunt Grace.

359
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,774
You'd better wait here.
They might recognize the car.

360
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,578
I'll keep the motor running
in case we have to make
a quick getaway.

361
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,585
I'm awfully nervous.
Don't worry.

362
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,587
Mr. Drake?
The horses ready, Dan?

363
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:59,283
Yes, sir,
all 13 of them.
Thirteen's bad luck.

364
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:02,087
We're not
superstitious, are we?
Let's wait for Barbara.

365
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,859
It's only a little after 2:30.
If we wait for her, we'll have
to make this a moonlight ride.

366
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:10,299
She'll probably just arrive
by the time we get back.
Let's go.

367
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:14,862
I think if we go off without
her, it'll be good for her.
I think we should wait.

368
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,573
Uh... Uh.

369
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:27,217
Hey!

370
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,421
Barbara know about
this trip you're taking?

371
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:34,515
I didn't even tell the family
'til this morning.
When do you leave?

372
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:38,689
A month. We don't start up
the Amazon 'til late September.
The Amazon's a river, isn't it?

373
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,561
Named after
a tribe of women.
So that's
what's behind this expedition.

374
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,567
Barbara'll
be thrilled.
Are you with us?

375
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,933
No, I'm alone.
How cozy.

376
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:52,403
Mr. Kirkpatrick.!
Wanted on the telephone.!

377
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:57,078
All right, Willie.
I'll take it.
Yes, sir.

378
00:26:57,148 --> 00:27:00,117
Won't be a minute.

379
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:03,211
[Chattering]

380
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:11,059
Mr. Drake!
Wanted on the telephone!

381
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:14,326
- That must be Barbara.
- Maybe it's Dad.
You go on along.

382
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:17,664
- Oh, we'll wait.
- No, go ahead. I'll
meet you at the willows.

383
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:19,670
Don't be long.
I won't.

384
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,854
Nice horsey.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

385
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:45,657
I just want
to undo this.

386
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,824
I'm not gonna hurt you.
See? Sugar. Sugar.

387
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,834
Just wanna undo this, see?

388
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,564
That's it.
Come on.
Get the sugar.

389
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:58,166
Got some more in here.
You can have that when
you get to the barn.

390
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:00,768
Come on.
Get the sugar.

391
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:04,872
You can have it all
if you'll just come
to the barn. Come on.

392
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,878
Come on.
I got some more for you.
You like sugar, don't you?

393
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,626
So do I. Come on.
Get the sugar.

394
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:19,095
That's a good horsey.
Come on. Come on.

395
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,758
Did you call me
to the phone?
No, Mr. Drake.

396
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:24,563
There's nobody on it.
Somebody called.
I'm sorry, sir.

397
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:29,369
- What's going on
with that horse?
- Come on.

398
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:32,842
There's lots more
where this came from.
Come on. That's a boy.

399
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:35,971
I don't like my horse
to have sugar.
Oh, he likes it.

400
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,242
Hey, Shamrock!
Come here, boy. Hey!

401
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:47,216
Hey! Hey, Shamrock. Here!
Come back here!

402
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,556
Here, fella, take it easy.

403
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,695
Hey!

404
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:03,464
The horses have
enough trouble with this jump
without looking out for you.

405
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:06,271
I fell when you chased me.
I wasn't chasing you.
I was chasing the horse.

406
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:09,438
Not that way.
Look out!

407
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,573
Let's get out of here
before another horse
takes after you.

408
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:13,844
What are you tryin' to do,
kill yourself?

409
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,944
Between stuffing my horse
with sugar and making yourself
a steeplechase hazard,

410
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:19,012
you've had
a pretty busy day.

411
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,856
If one of those jumpers
had been short, you'd really
have something to worry about.

412
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:26,886
Now run along and try
and keep out of mischief.
[Muttering]

413
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:32,965
[Crying]

414
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:37,540
Oh, come on.
You're all right now.

415
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,134
Is there a handkerchief
in there? Let me
get it for you.

416
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:42,406
It's nothing.
It's just a natural react...

417
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:49,812
You must like horses
an awful lot.
No, I don't. I just...

418
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:52,652
You carry a lot
of sugar around.
Oh, that's...

419
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,851
Could you show me the way
out of here, please?

420
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:57,326
The same way you got in.
I've got friends waiting.

421
00:29:57,395 --> 00:30:00,023
It'd only take
a few minutes.
I'm a little dizzy.

422
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:05,229
Well, that, young lady, is
a masterpiece of understatement.
You're the dizz...

423
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:13,233
Now I wonder
what's happened to her.

424
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:17,042
That's fine. You ought to have
a keeper or a nurse.

425
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,106
Ted!

426
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:24,216
What are you doing?
The kid's fainted.
She had a bad scare.

427
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:26,723
Get some water.
I'll take care of her.
Who is she?

428
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:29,783
I don't know. You
better get some water.
I'll be right back.

429
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:35,832
All right, thanks.

430
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,063
You're welcome.
You didn't have to
kill yourself.

431
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:41,901
You told me to keep him here.
I didn't tell you
to hang on his neck.

432
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:45,807
I didn't. He held me up...
Go on home.
Don't let anybody see you.

433
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:48,539
I just wanted to thank him.
He was awfully nice.

434
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:50,979
Do you want to spoil
everything now?
Oh, no.

435
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:54,348
Then get out of here
before he gets back.
Hurry up!
Barbara!

436
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,786
If you'd only...
Will you do what
you're told for a change?

437
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:01,584
I only want
to thank him...
I'll thank him.

438
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:04,093
Go home before
he sees you again.
But...

439
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:10,827
Will you get
my horse out, Frankie?
Yes, Miss Clinton. Right away.

440
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:13,268
What's happened
to our patient?
Oh, that little brat.

441
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:17,536
- She ran off like a rabbit.
- She's a funny kid.
Who do you think she is?

442
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:20,373
You don't know?
The first time
I ever saw her...

443
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,538
was when I caught her
feeding sugar to my horse.

444
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:25,048
A likely story. Girls
just chase you around.

445
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:27,880
- Hello, Wilma.
- I'm so glad you
finally got here.

446
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:31,046
- The gang went on, Ted.
- I'll get my horse
and be right back.

447
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:34,114
You look lovely.
If I slept this late,
I'd be a sight.

448
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:37,093
You're priceless.
You always look the same
no matter what you do.

449
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:39,686
Mademoiselle Bristo says that
whenever she gives me a facial.

450
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:42,699
You ought to try her.
She's marvelous at
taking bad lines out.

451
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:45,998
- She must be miraculous.
- You'd be surprised what
she can do for your nerves.

452
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,039
That's where you
plump people are lucky.
You have no nerves.

453
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:53,066
Here you are, Miss Clinton.
Be careful. That hat might
make him a little skittish.

454
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:56,443
Don't worry about the General.
He has better taste
than most people.

455
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:59,847
- Horses always know
more than their riders.
- Which path do we take?

456
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,354
The upper one is shorter,
but there are too many
jumps for Barbara.

457
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,390
Don't worry about me.
The upper road is
ten minutes faster.

458
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:09,620
Ted and I will
take the lower one
and race you there.

459
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:12,458
All right, let's go.
Careful with
those jumps, dear.

460
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,501
Barbara!
How nice of you
to hurry home for tea.

461
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:29,978
Who wants tea?
Why, dear pet,
what happened to you?

462
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:33,040
Wilma Van Everett.
What did
little Wilma do?

463
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,051
I'd like to kill
"little" Wilma.

464
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,555
What did she do, dear?
Something horrible,
I trust?

465
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:43,424
She succeeded in making herself
ridiculous in front of everybody
at the club this afternoon.

466
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:45,792
She acted like a fool
over Ted Drake.

467
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:48,195
That's terrible!
Put them there, Connie.
All right.

468
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:51,463
You certainly covered
yourself with glory today.
I only tried to...

469
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:54,630
You tried brilliantly.
Never mind. Tell
your story, Barbara.

470
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:57,004
You wouldn't believe it
unless you were there.
I would.

471
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:59,009
She only advertised
to everybody present...

472
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:01,602
that she was
head-over-heels
in love with Ted.

473
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,909
That's silly!
It was revolting.
Why?

474
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:08,009
- Girls fall in love
with Ted all the time.
- She only just met him!

475
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:11,647
Love at first sight.
I've read about it.
It's very rare.

476
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:16,092
A Leo and Sagittarius might
do it if Saturn were in accord.
Her birthday is...

477
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,095
- December 4th.
- How do you know?

478
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,961
I certainly
should know.
You know her, do you?

479
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:24,558
What are you...
Everybody knows
Wilma Van Everett.

480
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:28,036
She gets twice as much
publicity as you do.
She does not.!

481
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,040
Does.
Doesn't.
Mother!

482
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:34,909
Walter! Isn't that strange?
That's the same birthday as you,
isn't it, Connie?

483
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:38,312
Yes, that's right.
December 4th.

484
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:41,910
[Barbara] I'm going to fix
Miss Van Everett. I'll see her
at the Drakes'party.

485
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:44,580
[Grace] Are the Drakes
going to have a party?
[Barbara] On the 29th.

486
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:48,751
I'll have something figured out.
Everybody will know about it
because everybody will be there.

487
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:52,887
Everybody?
Connie, what are
you going to wear?

488
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,990
To the party you mean?
Oh, I haven't been in...

489
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:59,264
I'm not going, am I?

490
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:04,400
- Of course you are. Sister
just said everybody's going.
- I haven't... I'd have to wear...

491
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:07,569
- It's formal, isn't it?
- Barbara's probably got
something upstairs...

492
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:09,875
that would suit you
perfect.

493
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:12,507
How about it?
And have people say
she's wearing my castoffs?

494
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:16,178
- We wouldn't want
that, would we?
- No. Of course not.

495
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:18,882
But I could wear...
Mother...
Wait. You're interrupting.

496
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:22,824
You could what?
I could wear my
graduation dress.

497
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,795
It's very pretty,
and it's long and white.
All white.

498
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:29,094
White's a pretty color.
It isn't
a garden party.

499
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:32,830
I could make it into
an evening dress. I'd just
have to fix the sleeves...

500
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,362
See how simple it is?
I'll start figuring out
what to do with it.

501
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:38,875
And thank you.
Thank you very much.

502
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:40,877
I took sewing
in school, you know.

503
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:44,346
I'll have to fix the skirt
a little, and maybe I can
fix the neck.

504
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,576
We're not going
to drag her to the ball.

505
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:50,883
If she fixes her dress, I'm
afraid we'll have to take her.
You can't get out of it.

506
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:53,890
Don't think I'm going to be
bothered with her
once she gets there.

507
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:56,791
Be nice to her at the ball,
sister, or people will have
an excuse...

508
00:34:56,861 --> 00:35:01,355
to say some of the things
they've been thinking
about you for years.

509
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,761
I'm going to
the Drakes' ball.
What are you gonna do?

510
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,137
I'm going to
the Drakes' ball.
No foolin'!

511
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:14,440
Absolutely. I have to cut
the sleeves out. I have to
make this into an evening dress.

512
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:17,242
- Does the duchess
know you're going?
- Barbara? Certainly.

513
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:21,615
They only just told me
about it. I didn't
dream I was going.

514
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:25,349
That's wonderful, Miss Connie.
I'm so happy for you.
Thank you, Agnes.

515
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:29,985
I do want to look pretty
when he sees me this time...
when people see me.

516
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:32,996
I mean...
You know.
When who sees you
this time?

517
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:37,694
Everybody. Everybody in
New York's going to be there.
What slippers shall I wear?

518
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:39,702
Who's the "he" you were
just talkin' about?

519
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:44,070
I didn't mean any particular
person. Do you think these
slippers'll be all right?

520
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:48,101
Maybe if I cut the neckline
lower and sort of
flare out the skirt.

521
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:51,740
Miss OIlie could tell you.
She makes all her clothes.
Do you think she'd mind?

522
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:55,684
Oh, no, OIlie loves to...
I didn't know you knew
any "he" in New York.

523
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:59,052
I don't know any "he"...
I mean anybody.

524
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:02,354
Just because you see a person
doesn't mean you know a person.

525
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:05,327
Let's go ask OIlie
about the dress.
She's in the kitchen.

526
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:09,227
Miss Connie's going to the...
George told us.

527
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,531
Did they tell you about it?
I couldn't help
overhearing.

528
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,128
I'm almost as happy
as if I were going myself.

529
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:18,505
I've never been to
a big party like this before.
It'll be a great night.

530
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:20,874
It certainly will.
Is that the dress
you want to make over?

531
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:25,609
Yes, Agnes said you might
help me. May I put it here?
Put it anywhere.

532
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:29,517
It still has sleeves.
I thought if we'd only use
the skirt and make a bodice...

533
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:31,452
and then flare the skirt...

534
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,548
Don't mind me.
I only eat here.

535
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:39,153
That's my brother Mike.
This is Miss Connie. You know,
I told you about her singing.

536
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:42,097
- How do you do?
- Don't let me stop
the operation.

537
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:45,397
I'm used to blood.
Have you any more
of this material?

538
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:48,233
No, but I have
a yard of silver lace.
Maybe you can use that.

539
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:51,070
Only a yard?
Yes, but it's very pretty.
I'll run get it.

540
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,667
The design's lovely.
You'll see.

541
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:56,679
It's a good thing
it wasn't one of the others
that found you here.

542
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:58,942
They would have
called the police.
Fine crack.

543
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:01,951
Think you can fix it up?
I can try. I wish
the waist was higher.

544
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:06,422
Hold this.
Gotta look beautiful at that
ball for a very special reason.

545
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,288
What's his name?
What do you think I am,
a tattletale?

546
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,987
How about hoops?
Never mind hoops.

547
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,259
You better watch that roast or
we'll have a terrible dinner.
Oh, my gracious!

548
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:17,733
Well done might be all right
for the family, but I like
my beef rare.

549
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,669
What can I do?
Why don't you put
some feathers on it?

550
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:24,139
How about those things
on the shoulders like
football players wear?

551
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:27,143
I just don't know
what to do.
I can tell you.

552
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:30,442
- This oughta be good.
- You take this dress...

553
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:32,778
and first,
you hide it away,

554
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,410
and then you go out
and buy her a whole
new outfit.

555
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:37,386
With what?
With money.

556
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:39,650
Whose money?
My money and your money.

557
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:42,124
And mine too.
Count me in.
And me.

558
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:45,060
Only goes to show
you don't get nothin'
for nothin' in this world,

559
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:47,063
not even from
your own sister.

560
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:49,065
How much?

561
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:05,908
It wasn't hard to do at all,
miss. I just bought another
yard or two of that lace.

562
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:08,076
Every bit of it
seems different.

563
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:11,053
When I remodel a dress,
I really remodel it.

564
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,421
The slippers just arrived.
I had to bring them up and
see how she looked.

565
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,960
It's a perfect fit.
It's really magnificent.

566
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:20,020
I still can't believe
it's the same dress.
OIlie did a lot of work on it.

567
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,997
May I put these on,
please?

568
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:25,763
These aren't my slippers.
Well, you see,
we took them out to a man...

569
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:27,701
to have some silver
put on them.

570
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,569
You know, like...
Like dyeing.

571
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,872
While he was doing it,
he spilled it all inside,
and you couldn't have worn them.

572
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:37,573
- So he only did what was right.
- He got you a new pair.

573
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,616
He shouldn't have
done that.
He's insured.

574
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:41,743
Do they feel
all right?
Why, yes.

575
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:46,483
They're just a little bit new,
but they fit perfectly.
[Knocking]

576
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:49,253
Come in.
I just wanted to see
how you looked.

577
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,524
You couldn't even tell
it was the same dress.
You look like a picture!

578
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:55,531
I don't see how...
OIlie must have worked
day and night...

579
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,829
Oh, turn around
a minute.
How does the skirt hang?

580
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:00,200
Perfect!
Why don't you go
in Miss Barbara's room?

581
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:02,398
You can see how
you really look.
That's a good idea.

582
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:05,704
I'll be back
in a minute.
Oh, just a second.

583
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,340
Thank you.
These just came
for you, miss.

584
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:12,177
How lovely!
Who sent it?

585
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:16,413
There wasn't any card.
Probably some admirer who knew
you were going to the ball.

586
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:19,012
Oh, you mean...
No.

587
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,388
How could he...
Oh, I don't think so.

588
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:24,428
They match your dress.
Isn't that nice?
[Barbara] Ollie.!

589
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:27,487
- Oh, I've been expecting that.
- OIlie, where have you been?

590
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:30,056
I want a large chiffon
handkerchief, black.
The bracelet.

591
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:33,501
Yes, miss.

592
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:37,769
Pardon me a minute.
I want to see how the skirt
hangs in the back.

593
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:39,810
I think it's
all right, don't you?

594
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:43,870
- What school did you
graduate from in that dress?
- We fixed it up. You like it?

595
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:47,384
The skirt hangs perfectly.
Oh, I forgot my locket.
I better go get it.

596
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:49,385
You look
very nice too.
Thanks.

597
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:52,581
I don't think
I'd look so good
in black.

598
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:56,114
You'd better hurry.
We don't want to be too late.

599
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:59,890
Did you see that?
Yes, miss. I think
she looks very nice.

600
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:03,297
Has she gone crazy,
storming in here,
patronizing me?

601
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:06,564
Oh, no, she's
just so thrilled about
going to the Drakes'.

602
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:09,333
She's taking
a lot for granted.
She isn't there yet.

603
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,568
Bring my wrap.
Yes, miss.

604
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:16,439
Did you hear that?
Yes!
What'd she say?

605
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:20,211
Mother, are you ready?
Yes, dear. I was looking
up the stars for tonight.

606
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:22,218
We're going to have
a marvelous evening.
I doubt that.

607
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:26,347
You mustn't doubt the stars.
They control your destiny,
whether you like it or not.

608
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,689
Ready? That's a very
smart gown, Aunt Grace.
Thank you.

609
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,558
Have you seen
my new dress?
Connie, it's amazing!

610
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,689
My wrap, please.
Mother, can we go?

611
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,427
Certainly. George,
is the car waiting?
Yes, Miss Connie.

612
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:39,435
Your cigarette case.
Where did
you find it?

613
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:42,199
In Mr. Clinton's study.
Oh, dear, where will I
leave it next?

614
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:47,176
[Connie] Have you seen the
newspaper? The society page is
full of details about the ball.

615
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:50,475
It mentioned all
the famous people who
are going to be there.

616
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,482
It's sure to be
a brilliant affair.

617
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,417
I hope they don't
just play rumbas.
You'd prefer waltzes.

618
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:59,388
I like waltzes.
I do too.
So do I. Dreamy ones.

619
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,322
My wrap.
This one?

620
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:04,623
No, the other one.
Mother, I think I'll
wear your pearl bracelet.

621
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:07,687
It goes better
with a black dress.
This isn't mine!

622
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:11,030
It is tonight.
Tomorrow it goes back
in Cousin Egbert's show window.

623
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:13,001
Oh, but really...
Shh!

624
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:16,039
- Shh.
- If Mr. Clinton comes,
tell him we'll be late.

625
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:19,542
Yes, ma'am.
Suppose UncleJason comes in
from Washington tonight?

626
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,544
What makes you think
he's coming tonight?

627
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:24,638
Aunt Louise
said yesterday
that he might.
She did?

628
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:27,843
I forgot to tell you.
Let's hope he doesn't arrive
until tomorrow.

629
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:31,979
If he does come and there isn't
one member of the family home,
we'll never hear the end of it.

630
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:35,025
I'll be glad to stay
and welcome him.
He hates the sight of you.

631
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:36,992
Can't say that
I blame him.
How about Father?

632
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:40,155
Your father won't be home
until all hours.
It's no great problem.

633
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:44,190
Connie can stay and sing
to him or something. You
don't mind, do you, Connie?

634
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:47,203
- Tonight? Now?
- You're dear to do it.

635
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:52,104
- Y-You mean I'm to wait here?
- Just make our excuses.

636
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:55,668
And fuss over him
when he arrives.
No.

637
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:59,204
No. You're not really going
to make me miss the party.

638
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:01,843
You can't.
That isn't fair.

639
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:06,686
You could have told me sooner
so I wouldn't plan and...
and wait and...

640
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:10,022
If you're going to argue
about everything we ask
you to do, I'll stay.

641
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:12,824
You can't do that.
The Drakes would be offended.

642
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:15,058
We'll make it up to you, Connie.

643
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:17,293
Barbara, you're only...

644
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,496
[Barbara]
I should think you'd be happy
to do something for us.

645
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:25,167
I could have told you a week ago
this would happen. Wanted to
see if I guessed right. I did.

646
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:27,176
Night.

647
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:31,804
[Door Slams]
Terry!
Sorry, ma'am.

648
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:36,643
[Mumbles]

649
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:39,746
[Engine Starting, Revving]

650
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:45,721
All right.
I'll stay home.

651
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:48,715
I'll say you will.

652
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:54,653
Going to the ball
wasn't my idea.
You were pretty anxious.

653
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:57,326
I like to dance. Is there
anything wrong with that?

654
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,835
Who would you dance with?
Ted Drake?

655
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:03,964
That's silly.
Of course it's silly.
But that's who you mean.

656
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:07,306
And it's twice as silly
to be getting any
foolish ideas about him.

657
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:12,782
I'm not!
Oh, no?
What about that picture you
cut out of the newspaper?

658
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:15,944
Who was that?
Ted Drake, that's who.

659
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:20,252
I just cut it out.
There wasn't any reason
for cutting it out.

660
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:23,657
I suppose there isn't any reason
for keeping it hidden
in that book, either.

661
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:27,629
In what book?
In what book!
In that book!

662
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:30,360
That?
Stop being a silly girl.

663
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:34,097
Get that picture, tear it up
and throw it away this minute.

664
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:37,231
That's exactly
what I'm going to do.

665
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:39,502
See?
I'm tearing it up.

666
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:41,840
[Knock At Door]
I don't want to hear
or think about him,

667
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:44,608
or have any more silly ideas
about myself or anybody else.

668
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:50,743
George, l-I
didn't know you...
I knocked twice, miss,

669
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:54,655
and when I heard you
talking to someone I
thought I'd better step in.

670
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:57,387
There's no one in here.
Talking?

671
00:44:57,461 --> 00:45:01,522
Oh! I must have been
talking to myself.

672
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:05,932
I'm sorry to interrupt, miss,
but everything's been arranged
and you're going to the ball.

673
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:09,097
I am?
Indeed you are. UncleJason
is still in Washington.

674
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:11,107
But Aunt Grace said...
They'll be there.

675
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:13,234
They won't arrive
until midnight.

676
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,676
They'll be there
long before that.

677
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:17,907
No, they won't, miss.
Everything's been changed.

678
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:20,575
You'll be there and back
before they even arrive.
How will I go?

679
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:22,482
In your car.
And it's a pippin.

680
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,044
Who'll take me?
You'll have an escort
of six white bikes.

681
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:27,317
Six white what?
Bikes, miss.
Motor police.

682
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:32,053
And there they are.

683
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:35,791
You mean l...
I'm to go with them?

684
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:37,925
They'll get you there
before you can say
"Jack Robinson."

685
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:39,901
Mike told them
you were in a hurry.
Mike?

686
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:43,565
My brother, miss. These lads
work with him. They borrowed
the commissioner's car.

687
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,837
Now remember, miss.
You're not to stay
a minute later than 12:00.

688
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:50,573
I won't.
And the boys will be waiting
for you to bring you back.

689
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:52,581
All right.

690

how much I appreciate...

have the time of your life.

That's good.
What time will they be back?

Very late,

that family think of next?
I really don't know, sir.

no noise around here
until they get back.

Have you got it
or ain't you?
I know I had it yesterday.

I usually keep it
in the pocket in this door.

about your personal habits.

the owner's license.

we have to go now.

Yes, ma'am, just as soon...
I think the whole thing
is ridiculous.

Maybe it is and
maybe it ain't, sister.
But I gotta stop...

and see the owner's license,
or else take 'em in.

Maybe.

Come on, buddy.
You're makin'
a big mistake, officer.

the kind of people who
would steal an automobile?

Why should I answer that
and make you sore?
You'll pay for this.

what you've done...

doing that Saint Vitus' dance
and admit you ain't got it?

on the bike?

happen. I saw it in the stars.

You told me this was
gonna be a perfect evening.

have been except for Venus.

this evening, isn't it?
Yes.

where we met before.

758
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:36,289
Course I know you
perfectly well, but I can't
seem to remember your name.

759
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,960
It's not Fisher, not Fowler.
Foster!
Wrong.

I have a remarkable memory
for names.

762
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:46,137
I'll get yours in a minute.
I don't think you will.

763
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:48,575
Yes, I will. And when I do,
I'm going to make you
pay a forfeit.

764
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:51,341
All right. But I don't think
you'll find out. I have to
go and look for somebody.

Hello, Bevans.
Lose something?
Signorina Cottillini.

767
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:58,387
Mr. Bevans,
you are sweet.

768
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:00,787
And you're going to sing
for us tonight.
I can't.

769
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:04,588
I'm in such poor voice.
My tour was so, so trying.

770
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:07,721
I said to Doug, "I will go,
but I will not sing."

771
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:10,494
You must sing,
I insist.
I can't possibly.

772
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:14,970
And I have no music with me
except... Doug, you have it.

773
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:17,438
It's just a Strauss waltz.
And tell the orchestra...
A Strauss waltz.

774
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:21,341
I did mark a change in tone
in the first eight bars in case
they do have to play it.

775
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:26,144
[Indistinct Chattering]

776
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:28,309
Oh, I'm sorry.

777
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:31,149
- Oh, Mr. Drake.
- I should have watched where I was going.

778
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,314
Oh, no,
it's all my fault.
Having a good time?

779
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:36,484
Oh, yes. Yes, I am.
That's fine.
I'm glad you came.

780
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:40,360
Oh, are you? I didn't think
I was going to get here at all.

781
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:44,526
That would have been terrible.
L... How's the rest of your...
How's everybody?

782
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:49,504
Oh, I don't know.
I haven't seen them since...
They're all right, I guess.

783
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:52,371
How are you... Your...
You still live at
the same place on, uh...

784
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:55,240
Oh, yes.
Yes, so do we.

785
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:57,803
Ted, we're dancing this one.
You're gonna be around?

786
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:01,908
I'll be around somewhere here.
Excuse me.
I'll see you later.

787
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:03,953
Who's that
pretty little girl?
I don't know.

788
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,921
Her face is familiar.
I can't figure out
where I met her.

789
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:17,161
Oh. Good evening.
How do you do?

790
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:30,546
[Orchestra Stops,

791
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:33,777
Thank you.
[Coughs]
Ladies and gentlemen.

792
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:36,648
We are most fortunate
in having with us tonight...

793
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,156
a singer whose greatness
is exceeded only
by her loveliness.

794
00:52:40,223 --> 00:52:43,989
She truly has the gift
of song. A golden voice,

795
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:49,225
an inspired talent
and a charming personality.

796
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:53,861
Now, she's a very shy
young lady and though I know
I should not impose upon her,

797
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:56,531
I do so in the name
of Mr. Drake, our host,

798
00:52:56,606 --> 00:53:01,600
and because it happens, quite
by chance, that the orchestra
has here a Strauss waltz...

799
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:05,239
which I think we may
persuade her to sing for us.

800
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:08,045
Shall we ask her?
[Applause]

801
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:23,728
[Mr. Bevans]
Ladies and gentlemen, it is
now my great privilege...

802
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,463
to introduce to you
Signorina Marguerita Cottillini.

803
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:31,132
Wrong again!

804
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,301
[Orchestra]
I'm afraid someone's made
a frightful mistake.

805
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:36,243
Oh, no, no. Whoever told you
I could sing was right,

806
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:39,805
but my name is not that
Signorina... whatever you said.

807
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:44,547
Life is sweet and gay
All the world's at play

808
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:49,285
There are blossoms of sunbeams
that glorify the day

809
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:52,954
And a gentle breeze
wafting through the trees

810
00:53:53,029 --> 00:53:58,092
Serenades me with music
of tender melodies

to the birds

Sensational!

My dear young lady,
that was a real treat.
I want to thank you for it.

844
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:50,202
You're welcome.
I like to sing.

845

Gerald! This young girl
has a great voice.

846
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:55,173
I thought you'd
like her, Mr. Drake.
You were splendid.

847
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,839
Oh, are you...
Yes, I'm Ted's father.

848
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:01,372
I'm going to tell that
young man something for not
bringing you around sooner.

849
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:03,817
Where is that boy?
Ted!
Right over there.

850
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:06,014
Wasn't that great?
Glad you liked it.

851
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:09,547
I was telling this young lady
I was disappointed in you
keeping her hidden this long.

852
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:13,187
This long?
I didn't even know that...
Now, now, son.

I know I'm old, but there's
nothing wrong with my eyes.

854
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:19,301
And I can tell
by looking at you two
that you're real old friends.

855
00:57:19,369 --> 00:57:21,530
Mr. Drake...
Would you like to dance?

856
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:24,095
You hear that, Bevans?
Would she like to? What's the
matter with you young fellas?

857
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:26,938
She'd love to dance.
Yes, I would.

00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:40,851
Lovely young lady,
Gerald.
Yes, indeed, Mr. Drake.

859
00:57:40,924 --> 00:57:44,018
I wish that boy of mine
would get interested in a girl
like that and stay home...

860
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:46,254
instead of hopping off
on that South American thing.

861
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:48,524
Maybe he will.
Yes, maybe.

862
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:52,534
What'd you say her name was?
Don't start that!
I don't know!

863
00:58:00,343 --> 00:58:03,403
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's my fault.
I'm used to leading.

864
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:08,144
At school when just we
girls danced, one led and...
And the other followed.

865
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:11,745
That's right.
How's your horse?
Shamrock?

866

Yes. I hope the sugar
didn't make him sick.

867
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:20,756
What's the matter?
I'm sorry. I was thinking
how different you look.

868
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:23,958
I'm glad of that.
I didn't see my face
until I got in the car.

00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:26,593
You were in a bad way there
for a few minutes.

870
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:30,230
I didn't thank you for being
so nice about everything and
tell you I was all right.

871
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:34,402
I figured you were all right
when I heard you'd run away.
I couldn't help that.

872
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:38,436
Don't, don't ever
run away again
without saying good-bye.

is it?
No, not at all.

If you'd rather go inside...
No.

Maybe you would, though.
I could get your wrap.

I'm all right.

Do you...

01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:19,377
Go ahead.
It was nothing.
What were you going to say?

884
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:23,408
I was just thinking
I'm leaving here next week.

885
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:26,944
Are you?
I'm going to South America
with Dr. McKenzie.

haven't you?
McKenzie? I think I have.

authority on rubber trees.

He's been to the Amazon
30 times. He always says,

[Scottish Accent]
"I'm verra, verra fond
of the wee river."

890
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:40,195
He talks like that
and calls me laddie.

Laddie?

892
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:49,134
Do you have to go?
It's sort of a declaration
of independence to Dad.

893

He's got a lot of ideas about
handing me a ready-made future.

And it's after 12:00.

896
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:04,922
Yes, it certainly is.
Will you be away long?
About six months.

Well, it's on the same principal
as a regular gasoline engine...

of using crude oil...

knows the mayor, doesn't he?

01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:57,531
I never heard of such
inefficiency.
Does anybody know who...

927
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,973
Ted's looking for?
[Woman] Probably
the girl who was singing.

928
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:02,340
[Barbara]
He's certainly
in a dither about her.

929
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:04,845
[Walter]
Let's all go up
and help him find her.

930
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:27,298
Did you see that girl
with the white wrap?
She looked just like Connie.

931
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:29,338
It can't be.
Connie isn't here.

932
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:31,566
Did that wrap she
was wearing have a hood?
I don't know.

933
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,575
Have you seen
Ted running around
with that slipper?

934
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,543
I thought it was yours
'til I saw how small it was.

935
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:38,444
It belonged to some new girl,
somebody no one ever saw before.

936
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:40,948
Shejust ran away
with the party. Nobody's
seen Ted since she sang.

937
01:03:41,017 --> 01:03:45,351
And when she danced,
shejust closed her eyes
and lost herself in a dream.

938
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:48,515
Did that girl wear
a silver-lace dress?
Uh-huh. Very sweet.

939
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:51,685
Not severe like your black.
Just girlish. Do you know her?

940
01:03:51,761 --> 01:03:54,355
Tell you later.
Get my wrap, please.
Yes, miss.

941
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:58,660
We've been waiting for you,
miss.
Oh, George!

942
01:03:58,734 --> 01:04:00,668
Tell us all about it.
I don't know where
to begin.

943
01:04:00,736 --> 01:04:02,670
Any trouble getting in?
No.

944
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:05,639
- You didn't run into
Mrs. Clinton and the brats?
- No, but I saw them.

945
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:07,642
[Martha]
Did they see you?
[Agnes] What time?

946
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:09,701
No, I hid behind a post.
They got in about midnight.
How did you know...

947
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:12,543
A little bird told us.
[Agnes]
A little bird named Mike.

948
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:14,310
Did you dance?
Yes, and I sang.

949
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:18,410
I'll bet they cheered.
And Mr. Drake...

950
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:21,650
Oh, so that's the "he."
[Whistles]

951
01:04:21,724 --> 01:04:23,521
[Connie] Agnes, it was...
What I wouldn't have given
to see you.

952
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:26,323
He was so nice, Agnes.
Oh, don't ask me.
[George] What did you sing?

953
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:30,354
A Strauss waltz. You know.
[Humming]

954
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:32,799
We'd best go in the kitchen,
miss.
I've got some hot chocolate...

955
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,929
and a piece of cake for you.
And you can start
at the very beginning.

956
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:37,939
You're lame!
I lost a slipper.

957
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:40,271
How'd you do that?
It was awful.
I had to start running...

958
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:44,575
No more here. The old man's
working in his study
and we'll get into a...

959
01:04:46,649 --> 01:04:49,117
I'm working;
you're making noise.

960
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:51,585
So we'll have to stop the work
or stop the noise.

961
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:55,590
I'm very sorry.
It's my fault, UncleJim.

962
01:04:55,658 --> 01:04:58,821
Maybe it is.
We won't have any more of it.

963
01:05:05,534 --> 01:05:09,732
UncleJim. George told me
to be quiet or go to another
room so I wouldn't disturb you...

964
01:05:09,805 --> 01:05:11,602
Have a nice time
at the party?

965
01:05:11,674 --> 01:05:16,373
What? Oh, yes, wonderful.
Uh-huh.
Danced, huh?

966
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:19,414
Met some nice people?
Oh, yes, UncleJim.
Very nice.

967
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:22,007
What'd your cousin say
when she saw you?

968
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:25,815
Oh, I didn't speak to Barbara,
Aunt Grace or Walter, either.

969
01:05:25,888 --> 01:05:30,086
Smart girl. Run up
to bed now. Good night.

970
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:32,024
Good night.

971
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:36,394
The family must have stopped
someplace on the way...
Yeah, stopped in jail.

972
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:39,662
Kept 'em there
'til midnight. Should have
kept 'em there longer.

973
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:43,466
Jail? What happened?
Don't know.

974
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:46,440
They called me to get
my lawyer. Couldn't get him.

975
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:48,943
Couldn't remember
his telephone number.

976
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:53,948
Couldn't even remember his name.
Couldn't remember anything.

977
01:05:55,184 --> 01:05:59,382
I don't understand.
Had a good time,
you said.

978
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:03,824
You knew about
UncleJason?

979
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:08,227
I know a lot of things.
I know every cloud
has a silver lining.

980
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:10,891
They went to jail;
you went to the ball.

981
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,731
UncleJim, you...
Oh!

982
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:16,966
Car coming up the driveway.
This is all a secret.

983
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:21,339
I'll never tell a soul.
Make my life miserable
if you do. Yours too.

984
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:23,640
It's Barbara.
You'd better scat.

985
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:25,647
Good night.

986
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:32,417
Hurry up!

987
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,547
The duchess is coming!

988
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,648
[Car Door Slams]

989
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:59,411
Are you asleep?
Uh-huh. Ooh, that light
hurts my eyes.

990
01:06:59,482 --> 01:07:04,476
- I just wanted to see
that you were in.
- I'm in. Good night.

991
01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:07,283
Have you been in all night?
What time is it?

992
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:10,223
- You were home all night?
- UncleJason didn't arrive.

993
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:14,285
Sorry if I interrupted
your beauty sleep.
That's all right.

994
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:36,351
So you were at the party.
Yes.

995
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:39,217
And you sang.
Um-hmm.
I sang.

996
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:43,486
Didn't I tell you
to stay here?
I didn't want to.

997
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:46,119
Oh, you didn't want to.

998
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:49,164
Nope. I knew UncleJason
wasn't coming and I had
a chance to go, so I went.

999
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:53,725
- You mean you sneaked in.
- There's nothing you can do that
could spoil this night for me.

1000
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:57,933
Would it spoil things if I asked
how you turned your graduation
dress into a Paris creation?

1001
01:07:58,007 --> 01:08:02,501
OIlie made it out of some
silver lace I had. Not that
it's any of your business.

1002
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:06,105
And that wrap. She made that
out of a pair of pet ermine
she's been keeping?

1003
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:09,845
A friend of mine said I could...
I'm not going to quarrel
with you, Barbara.

1004
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:12,353
I'm so sorry I wasn't there.
You must have been wonderful.

1005
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:14,787
Thank you. Now, if you're
through being sarcastic...

1006
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:17,325
Even Ted said he never
had so much fun.

1007
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:20,521
He thought you were
a night club singer pretending
to be somebody important,

1008
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:22,359
so he decided
to play up to it.

1009
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:26,561
It's so funny. And his
imitation of you dancing with
your eyes shut is wonderful.

1010
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:30,594
People just roll on the floor
when he does it. He does it
over and over again.

1011
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:32,402
And leaving your slipper.
That was so touching.

1012
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:34,170
Ted's going to use it
to try and find you.

1013
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:36,336
He wants to hire you
to play the same joke
on a friend of his in Boston.

1014
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:39,848
You get out of here.
This is my room and l...

1015
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:43,817
Oh, you want to be alone.
You have so much to think about,
so much to dream over.

1016
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:45,820
Get out!
All right.

1017
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:49,346
I'll go down to the kitchen
and tell your chums
what a success you were.

1018
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:53,418
[Sobbing]

1019
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:01,531
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.

1020
01:09:01,604 --> 01:09:03,538
Your orange juice, sir.
Um-hmm.

1021
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:05,904
Your coffee black
as usual?
Um-hmm.

1022
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:08,705
Anything else, sir?
Not a thing.

1023
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:14,207
Then this is good-bye,
sir.

1024
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:17,884
Going someplace?

1025
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:21,480
I'm leaving, sir.
Miss Barbara sacked
the whole staff last night...

1026
01:09:21,557 --> 01:09:23,684
when she found out we'd helped
Miss Connie get to the party.

1027
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,693
What?
Oh, that's all right, sir.

1028
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:28,992
Not one of us would have stayed
after Miss Connie left.

1029
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:33,067
Connie left?

1030
01:09:33,135 --> 01:09:37,902
Bag and baggage, sir.
We wanted her to stay
and have a talk with you, sir,

1031
01:09:37,973 --> 01:09:39,964
but she said she had
made enough trouble.

1032
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:42,875
And didn't leave a note?
She said she'd
write to you, sir,

1033
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:45,675
when she was settled
and making her own way.

1034
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:50,481
I do think she was trying
to make it easier...
for us all.

1035
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:53,113
I'd like to talk
to the other servants, George.

1036
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:57,922
They've been
gone hours, sir.
[Mrs. Clinton]Jimmie.!

1037
01:09:57,993 --> 01:10:01,360
Jimmie, you have to
drive me into town.
We have no chauffeur.

1038
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:06,299
Did you know that Connie had left?
Yes, so has everyone else.
No cook, no butler, no maids.

1039
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:08,393
And you're not with us
anymore, are you, George?

1040
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:11,496
- No, madam, I'm not.
- Such a pity.
You're such a good butler too.

1041
01:10:11,574 --> 01:10:17,103
It was nothing personal. Just a bad
constellation for everybody.
It won't happen again.

1042
01:10:17,179 --> 01:10:20,808
Connie's a very young girl
to be out on her own.
It's not right.

1043
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:24,250
I'm going to look up her
horoscope and find out what evil
influence brought this about.

1044
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,084
I'm also going to see
if it's a good time
to employ new people.

1045
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:29,124
We have to wait
until the stars are right.

1046
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:33,093
I'm hungry.
The cook has left,
Mr. Walter.

1047
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:36,097
Father, can you make coffee?

1048
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:42,228
Do you know that your cousin
has left this house?

1049
01:10:42,304 --> 01:10:44,795
I only know
I'm hungry.

1050
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:55,315
Don't you think we better
do something practical
about Connie?

1051
01:10:55,384 --> 01:10:57,944
I'm doing the most
practical thing in the world:

1052
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:00,989
Checking her
complementary influence
againstJupiter's emphasis.

1053
01:11:01,056 --> 01:11:03,991
Then there's a trend
of depression that's been...
[Continues Indistinct]

1054
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:23,476
Jim, what are you doing?

1055
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:29,915
Jim, it's taken me years
to work that all out!

1056
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:32,647
I never liked
this thing, either!

1057
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:37,351
Jim, stop it!
Are you losing your mind?

1058
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:39,553
Now, you listen to me,
Gracie Schultz!

1059
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:42,392
I've had all the twaddle
I'm gonna have about
the eight and ninth house...

1060
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:46,764
and the influence of this and
that, and Leo being in Libra
that I'm gonna have!

1061
01:11:46,835 --> 01:11:48,769
I oughta make you
eat these things!

1062
01:11:48,837 --> 01:11:52,466
But if I ever hear
another peep outta you
about the sun, moon or stars,

1063
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:54,839
I promise you by the big
and little dipper,

1064
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:58,539
that you won't be only
talkin' about stars,
you'll be seein' 'em!

1065
01:11:58,614 --> 01:12:00,878
[Sobbing]
Let the heavens take care
of themselves!

1066
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:05,010
And you get down to earth!
Aurgh!

1067
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:07,920
[Sobbing]
Oh, Jim, you brute!
Don't flatter me!

1068
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:10,891
- I've only just begun!
- Father, have you gone crazy?

1069
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:13,757
[Sobbing Continues]
Oh, you're up.
That's fine.

1070
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:17,060
I was hoping I wouldn't have to
go and pull you out of bed.
Mother!

1071
01:12:17,132 --> 01:12:19,123
Why did you make Connie
leave this house?

1072
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:21,465
Now, Father.
Don't "Father" me! I know
what you did and for once...

1073
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:23,630
you're gonna pay
the consequences,
you selfish...

1074
01:12:23,706 --> 01:12:25,901
little dressed up ingrate!
I won't be talked to
like that!

1075
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:28,704
Then we'll stop talking!
You come in here!
Mother!

Oh, no, sir,
this one's on me.

1081
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:55,902
There's one more thing
I want you to...

1082
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:19,661
Don't you ever do anything
but sit sprawled out
in that chair?

1083
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:22,060
But, Father, I have
a theory, you know.
Really?

1084
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:26,534
A theory of relaxation.
I worked it all out myself.
In that chair?

1085
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:28,570
Um-hmm.
It's taken years.

1086
01:13:28,637 --> 01:13:32,073
I believe that one
through relaxation,
prolonged and constant,

1087
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:35,770
can store up sufficient energy
to surmount any emergency
that arises...

1088
01:13:35,844 --> 01:13:39,280
where vitality is called for
and force is needed.

1089
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:41,816
Simple, isn't it?
Almost too simple.

1090
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:44,148
You see, I don't spend energy,
I hoard it.

1091
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:47,154
Sort of sit on it?
Exactly.

1092
01:13:47,222 --> 01:13:50,191
I've already proved all forms
of exercise are wrong.

1093
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:52,659
Say a man gets up
and does his daily dozen.

1094
01:13:52,728 --> 01:13:55,390
The first time
he stretches,

1095
01:13:55,464 --> 01:13:57,864
bends over,
touches the floor,

1096
01:13:57,933 --> 01:14:00,731
he's spent 14 pounds
of energy.

1097
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:03,795
To get back to
his normal position, how much
do you think he spends?

1098
01:14:03,872 --> 01:14:08,502
Uh, from the position
you were in just now?

1099
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:11,239
Um-hmm. Identical with it.
Just about...

1100
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:14,771
Practically none, because
I'd help him like that!

Very well bowled, sir.

we gotta do! Find Connie

Did you get my telegram?

01:14:58,093 --> 01:15:01,620
No, I meet all the trains.
That's all I have to do.

Did I get your telegram?
Get those bags over here.

It's so quiet
and restful here.

such noisy places.

Are you surprised
that I'm back?
Nope.

All right then, I will be.
I'm surprised. Feel better?

Never mind. Go on.
You want to teach.

Yes, but I'll have to
have more training.
I hope so.

that I tell you...

why I've made this decision,

admire them and they'll purr.

Every woman
wants to make somebody purr.

something else?
