1 
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,000 
I am in luck 

2 
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,616 
This does not mean that I'm superstitious, 

3 
00:02:18,784 --> 00:02:22,743 
but I try not to pass 
under a ladder 

4 
00:02:24,756 --> 00:02:26,747 
I'm not afraid of damage or the evil eye 

5 
00:02:26,925 --> 00:02:28,722 
not believe in luck, and April 1 

6 
00:02:28,894 --> 00:02:33,160 
But I try to follow all the rules 

7 
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:36,767 
When I lie down in bed, 

8 
00:02:36,935 --> 00:02:40,166 
put on the window sill 
rabbit's foot 

9 
00:02:40,338 --> 00:02:44,001 
When I find quatrefoil 
clover, a lucky day 

10 
00:02:44,176 --> 00:02:47,703 
There are 13 reasons why 
I do 

11 
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:51,440 
I never was afraid of witches 
and, therefore, declare 

12 
00:02:51,616 --> 00:02:55,347 
I feel great 
and do not complain about health 

13 
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,512 
Why should I 
tempt fate? 

14 
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:11,833 
I never knew the evil eye, 
He does not scare me 

15 
00:03:12,003 --> 00:03:15,871 
Still do not have anything 
against a horseshoe over the door 

16 
00:03:18,076 --> 00:03:21,944 
I do not believe in mystical forces 
it's all nonsense 

17 
00:03:22,114 --> 00:03:26,107 
Still keeping my fingers 
criss-cross 

18 
00:03:26,551 --> 00:03:30,146 
make a wish when 
I see a shooting star 

19 
00:03:30,322 --> 00:03:33,587 
never eat oysters 
if the month has no letter "P" 

20 
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,320 
ever caught a ladybug, 
just let her 

21 
00:03:37,496 --> 00:03:41,227 
There are 13 reasons why 
I do 

22 
00:03:45,003 --> 00:03:48,598 
can not dance 
a barrel-organ 

23 
00:03:48,774 --> 00:03:53,541 
Podberesh rusty pin - 
wife will be with a double chin 

24 
00:03:55,881 --> 00:03:59,647 
not get a light threesome. 
Make a circle, knock on wood 

25 
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:04,585 
On the walk be careful - 
Never comes on crack 

26 
00:04:06,992 --> 00:04:10,621 
Children with a skipping rope - good luck 

27 
00:04:10,796 --> 00:04:13,162 
But if they drop the rope ...

28 
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:16,960 
I can go on the list 
All Day 

29 
00:04:17,135 --> 00:04:20,696 
Rope, horoscope, rusty 
pins, double chins 

30 
00:04:20,872 --> 00:04:23,773 
whole lot more 
such as wedding rings 

31 
00:04:23,942 --> 00:04:26,240 
wedding rings. 

32 
00:04:27,212 --> 00:04:30,375 
I see myself 

33 
00:04:30,549 --> 00:04:34,679 
sad and dreamy 

34 
00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:40,189 
in a wedding dress 

35 
00:04:41,526 --> 00:04:45,553 
This does not mean that I'm superstitious, 

36 
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,461 
But I see no harm if 
look in mart 

37 
00:04:51,736 --> 00:04:55,536 
cut off the petals of daisies 
and wonder just how very 

38 
00:04:55,707 --> 00:04:59,336 
Believe it or not, but I'm ready 
everything 

39 
00:04:59,511 --> 00:05:02,639 
Even if I fall in love 

40 
00:05:02,814 --> 00:05:07,080 
Even if I fall in love 

41 
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,700 
PARIS BEAUTY 

42 
00:05:46,591 --> 00:05:47,683 
Miss Williams. 

43 
00:05:47,859 --> 00:05:51,158 
-Sign. 
-Five minutes before leaving. 

44 
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:53,422 
-Oh, well, thank you. 
-Good. 

45 
00:06:06,678 --> 00:06:08,976 
Hap, here is your shirt. 

46 
00:06:09,147 --> 00:06:11,047 
Thank you, Candy. 

47 
00:06:11,216 --> 00:06:13,616 
-Duc, come in for a minute. 
Yes. 

48 
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,683 
Do you think this makeup will suit? 

49 
00:06:16,855 --> 00:06:19,187 
-Come on already. 
-Wait, wait. Come here. 

50 
00:06:19,357 --> 00:06:23,020 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
the invisible man! 

51 
00:06:23,194 --> 00:06:26,288 
-Hap, you stop? 
-Oh, you poor thing. 

52 
00:06:26,464 --> 00:06:29,194 
I want a little paint 
your life is gray. 

53 
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:32,393 
"You and drove me into this life. 
-Who feeds us. 

54 
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,664 
I read that wrote about us 
Miami Post? 

55 
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,438 
"Hap Snyder 
world-famous clown 

56 
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,037 
represents the Paris beauties 

57 
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,646 
extravagant room full of 
vivid scenes and uncontrollable laughter. " 

58 
00:06:42,814 --> 00:06:44,577 
-This is our advertising. 
-What is the difference? 

59 
00:06:44,749 --> 00:06:47,217 
It's a newspaper? 
Live, stupid, live. 

60 
00:06:47,385 --> 00:06:50,218 
-I wish I was like you ... 
So, come for a visit. 

61 
00:06:50,388 --> 00:06:51,753 
Why should I have been 
off Broadway 

62 
00:06:51,754 --> 00:06:53,118 
and come to this Klembeyk? 

63 
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,691 
Great! 
I have to tell everyone. 

64 
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,192 
He wants to know why he 
arrived in Klembeyk ... 

65 
00:06:58,363 --> 00:06:59,921 
-Wait a minute. 
-Have you heard? 

66 
00:07:00,098 --> 00:07:02,328 
-Duc wants to know - 
-Go performance. 

67 
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,400 
"You do not know? 
-I do not say. 

68 
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:06,816 
He does not know why. 
And we now know. 

69 
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:09,063 
No work, he did not believe it. 

70 
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,300 
But you believed in him. 
You thought he had talent? 

71 
00:07:12,477 --> 00:07:14,468 
Glad to see you. 

72 
00:07:14,646 --> 00:07:16,375 
What Klembeyk already forgotten? 

73 
00:07:16,548 --> 00:07:18,948 
I found you in the gutter 
and took in his show. 

74 
00:07:19,117 --> 00:07:21,500 
Out of the ditch in such a show - 
small progress. 

75 
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:23,884 
Duc, warn 
do not irritate me. 

76 
00:07:25,056 --> 00:07:27,786 
It's a theater, or flop? 
Again, no water. 

77 
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,826 
Hey, Broadway, let's. 

78 
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,698 
And one more thing. 
Your number begins to stall. 

79 
00:07:34,866 --> 00:07:37,460 
Add tempo, dynamics. 
Well, you know. 

80 
00:07:38,903 --> 00:07:41,167 
-Hap, stop. 
-What is it? 

81 
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:44,035 
Whistle in the dressing room - 
a bad omen. 

82 
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:47,838 
Two months into show business, 
and knows all the rules. 

83 
00:07:48,013 --> 00:07:50,846 
-You yourself told me this. 
-Listen to what else to say. 

84 
00:07:51,016 --> 00:07:53,416 
You're too talented, 
to be so superstitious. 

85 
00:07:53,585 --> 00:07:56,782 
Beautiful face, smile, 
figure ... 

86 
00:07:56,955 --> 00:07:58,138 
I wrote your name 
on the bill, see? 

87 
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,321 
Yes ... 

88 
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:01,618 
"Yes," said she, too, is beautiful. 

89 
00:08:02,494 --> 00:08:04,519 
Why do you not an island on the stage? 

90 
00:08:04,696 --> 00:08:07,460 
Soon, your exit. 
"We are already going. 

91 
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,758 
-Lightning is not buttoned ... 
-I will help you. 

92 
00:08:10,935 --> 00:08:12,232 
No, do not. 

93 
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:13,769 
Herself. 

94 
00:08:13,938 --> 00:08:15,428 
Come on, baby. 

95 
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,005 
Go! 

96 
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:26,042 
That's it. Without using their hands. 
Come on, baby. 

97 
00:08:28,386 --> 00:08:30,479 
This is an old trick. 

98 
00:08:31,256 --> 00:08:33,247 
How's the audience? 

99 
00:08:40,598 --> 00:08:42,327 
An almost empty hall, Hap. 

100 
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,367 
-Do not pay attention. 
"But they're asleep. 

101 
00:08:45,537 --> 00:08:48,870 
Wait, now I'll go. 
I am their wake. 

102 
00:09:13,198 --> 00:09:15,132 
Women! 

103 
00:09:36,287 --> 00:09:39,313 
Men, horrible man 

104 
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:42,483 
used to be said and am saying now 

105 
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,096 
What do I think about men - 
You can write a book 

106 
00:09:46,264 --> 00:09:49,529 
happy girl, 
which does not promise in marriage 

107 
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,371 
girls, you head in the clouds 

108 
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,634 
Who likes this? 
Who needs it? 

109 
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:01,802 
They throw you 
with song and dance 

110 
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,349 
they throw you for the sake 
another pair of pants 

111 
00:10:06,518 --> 00:10:09,578 
Men such a nose 

112 
00:10:09,754 --> 00:10:12,587 
like a chicken that 
rummaging through garbage 

113 
00:10:12,757 --> 00:10:16,090 
And believe me, sir, 

114 
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:19,697 
so all men, 
up to the President 

115 
00:10:19,864 --> 00:10:22,731 
Love, horrible word 

116 
00:10:22,901 --> 00:10:25,734 
Show me this darling, 
and I ask him 

117 
00:10:25,904 --> 00:10:29,067 
main thing is not looks, 
a checkbook 

118 
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,505 
Do not believe promises - 
Do as Mom says 

119 
00:10:32,677 --> 00:10:33,939 
doubt everything 

120 
00:10:34,112 --> 00:10:35,101 
Men 

121 
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:43,616 
Ah, women. 

122 
00:10:44,189 --> 00:10:46,987 
Do not forget - a woman 
supports man 

123 
00:10:47,158 --> 00:10:50,559 
in troubles, hardships 
and trials. 

124 
00:10:50,728 --> 00:10:52,241 
That is, in fact, from what 
Man freed, 

125 
00:10:52,242 --> 00:10:53,754 
if he is a bachelor. 

126 
00:10:53,932 --> 00:10:58,335 
What do you think about this? 

127 
00:10:59,737 --> 00:11:03,434 
You a little, but you guys are strong. 

128 
00:11:05,977 --> 00:11:07,035 
Correctly. 

129 
00:11:10,815 --> 00:11:13,113 
-Stunning success. 
-The audience simply lies. 

130 
00:11:13,451 --> 00:11:16,648 
Men bloodthirsty men 

131 
00:11:16,821 --> 00:11:19,722 
History says this 

132 
00:11:19,891 --> 00:11:22,758 
such as Bluebeard 
with axes and knives 

133 
00:11:22,927 --> 00:11:27,557 
Look what they did 
with their wives 

134 
00:11:30,501 --> 00:11:33,402 
Ladies, think about the ladies 

135 
00:11:33,571 --> 00:11:36,301 
poisoned her lovers poison 

136 
00:11:36,474 --> 00:11:38,772 
Lucrezia Borgia 

137 
00:11:38,943 --> 00:11:40,501 
You are beautiful 

138 
00:11:40,678 --> 00:11:43,511 
She prepared a drink 

139 
00:11:44,315 --> 00:11:49,651 
man drank 
and became a board 

140 
00:11:53,491 --> 00:11:57,018 
Men - devils from hell 

141 
00:11:57,195 --> 00:11:59,925 
example Henry VIII 

142 
00:12:00,098 --> 00:12:03,033 
married at six or seven 

143 
00:12:03,201 --> 00:12:06,932 
And when killed them 
beheaded him 

144 
00:12:07,105 --> 00:12:10,006 
Hey, hey, sing and dance 

145 
00:12:10,174 --> 00:12:13,268 
There is always a skirt for 
anyone who wears pants 

146 
00:12:13,444 --> 00:12:16,504 
And when they pass by 

147 
00:12:16,681 --> 00:12:19,548 
In them there is something 
and I can not live without them 

148 
00:12:19,717 --> 00:12:24,347 
I need a beautiful lady 

149 
00:12:24,522 --> 00:12:27,548 
I lost my head 

150 
00:12:27,725 --> 00:12:30,785 
I want all the men at once 

151 
00:12:30,962 --> 00:12:36,730 
For God's sake, give me a man 

152 
00:12:49,747 --> 00:12:51,305 
I think that's terrific. 

153 
00:12:51,482 --> 00:12:54,451 
You're the only one who thinks so 
because they do not pay for the ticket. 

154 
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:57,711 
We came to say 
that we should get out 

155 
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:01,154 
bye, bye 

156 
00:13:01,326 --> 00:13:04,193 
Thank you straight from the heart 
until the curtain falls. 

157 
00:13:04,362 --> 00:13:07,627 
for your loud ovation. 
And the curtain falls 

158 
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:10,427 
Excuse us, we must 
leaving 

159 
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:13,627 
O-la-la, 
You were great 

160 
00:13:14,138 --> 00:13:17,369 
But think about other cities, 

161 
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:21,638 
where waiting for our jokes and songs 

162 
00:13:21,813 --> 00:13:25,271 
Here's a kiss 
beauties of Paris 

163 
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,510 
I said goodbye and kiss you 

164 
00:13:28,686 --> 00:13:30,813 
and you and you and you ...

165 
00:13:30,988 --> 00:13:31,977 
Six, seven, eight, 

166 
00:13:32,156 --> 00:13:34,124 
nine, ten, eleven ... 

167 
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,990 
"What's wrong with you? 
-In Hall 13 spectators. 

168 
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,999 
No time for superstitions. 
Back, back. 

169 
00:13:47,004 --> 00:13:49,063 
Professor! 

170 
00:13:49,807 --> 00:13:53,208 
I am filled with emotion when 
I look and see how - 

171 
00:13:53,378 --> 00:13:54,936 
Lower the screen. 

172 
00:13:55,113 --> 00:13:56,307 
- leave me. 

173 
00:13:56,481 --> 00:14:00,008 
I will not leave you, friends 
On - because I - 

174 
00:14:00,184 --> 00:14:03,017 
Sorry. Lu. Louis, 
What are you doing? 

175 
00:14:03,521 --> 00:14:04,647 
Getting a movie. 

176 
00:14:07,425 --> 00:14:09,655 
Louis, what do you do 
too early, Lou! 

177 
00:14:09,656 --> 00:14:11,885 
You turn on the projector? 
Oh, no. 

178 
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:16,322 
We both can not lay an egg. 

179 
00:14:19,303 --> 00:14:21,669 
Well jokes. 

180 
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,307 
I thought they set their sights on me. 

181 
00:14:24,475 --> 00:14:27,638 
Get him off the stage! 

182 
00:14:28,413 --> 00:14:30,506 
I will not leave you, because - 

183 
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:38,619 
What's happening? 
Where the director? Where is he? 

184 
00:14:40,658 --> 00:14:42,256 
Have you seen? 
Where stagehands, 

185 
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:43,855 
What do they do? 

186 
00:14:44,028 --> 00:14:47,156 
I submit to the court. This is the worst show. 
Get out of my theater. 

187 
00:14:47,331 --> 00:14:49,925 
What are you talking about? 
We are the stars. Love us. 

188 
00:14:50,101 --> 00:14:53,264 
-The audience I have here. 
-Here's your money. 

189 
00:15:03,347 --> 00:15:05,542 
I found a room for the night. 

190 
00:15:05,716 --> 00:15:07,843 
Need to buy tickets. 
Bus in 15 minutes. 

191 
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:10,078 
We can handle wave at him. 

192 
00:15:10,254 --> 00:15:13,883 
"What's with our money? 
-A funny thing has turned out. 

193 
00:15:14,058 --> 00:15:16,424 
"What?" 
-I caught the lenders. 

194 
00:15:16,594 --> 00:15:18,994 
"And you've got left? 
Empty-pockets. 

195 
00:15:19,163 --> 00:15:20,721 
So we are now on the rocks? 

196 
00:15:20,898 --> 00:15:23,298 
It's not so bad. 
I have something come up. 

197 
00:15:23,468 --> 00:15:26,494 
Above his head. 
The clouds blue sky. 

198 
00:15:26,671 --> 00:15:27,763 
Look cheerful. 

199 
00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:30,169 
We are hungry, and you 
feed us with songs. 

200 
00:15:30,341 --> 00:15:34,038 
Someday we will laugh 
on it. Is that right? 

201 
00:15:34,212 --> 00:15:36,646 
Honey, do you hold your own. 

202 
00:15:36,814 --> 00:15:38,406 
There are many places to go. 

203 
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:41,017 
You know, wherever I want? 

204 
00:15:45,756 --> 00:15:46,745 
Right here. 

205 
00:15:50,895 --> 00:15:52,226 
"Anton's Restaurant." 

206 
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,022 
Not bad. 

207 
00:15:54,198 --> 00:15:56,416 
We have nothing but talent 
but there is some sort of crook 

208 
00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:58,635 
comes over his name 
neon signs. 

209 
00:15:59,704 --> 00:16:02,832 
"Good evening, Mr. Mahoney. 
"Good morning, Bonnie. 

210 
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:05,908 
How-ever? 
Yes, please. 

211 
00:16:08,312 --> 00:16:11,281 
Oh, look who it is. 
Parisian beauty. 

212 
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:13,667 
Mr. Snyder is 
very funny show, 

213 
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:15,886 
that I have ever seen. 

214 
00:16:16,053 --> 00:16:18,112 
-Thank you, Mr. Mahoney. 
-Glad you enjoyed it. 

215 
00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:20,814 
Like it? Yes, I'm shocked! 
You are all lovely. 

216 
00:16:20,992 --> 00:16:23,256 
Where will you serve 
next week? 

217 
00:16:23,427 --> 00:16:25,486 
-If it is near - 
-This is your neighborhood? 

218 
00:16:25,663 --> 00:16:29,224 
-12 Years here I serve. 
-Come on. 

219 
00:16:31,969 --> 00:16:34,836 
Mahoney, show me a favor. 
Great service. 

220 
00:16:35,006 --> 00:16:36,803 
-You're welcome, Mr. Snyder. 
-Good. 

221 
00:16:36,974 --> 00:16:39,670 
Now I'll take their 
artists in the hotel across the road. 

222 
00:16:39,844 --> 00:16:41,505 
And we will show a little trick. 

223 
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:44,443 
When I shout to you, 
We will arrest you. 

224 
00:16:44,615 --> 00:16:47,448 
Arrest you? 
I can not. 

225 
00:16:47,618 --> 00:16:49,432 
But I really need. 

226 
00:16:49,433 --> 00:16:51,247 
I beg of you. 
Arrest us. 

227 
00:16:51,422 --> 00:16:53,071 
Just arrest. 

228 
00:16:53,072 --> 00:16:54,721 
It's not too 
big favor for a friend? 

229 
00:16:54,892 --> 00:16:58,225 
But when I arrest you 
and will lead to the site, 

230 
00:16:58,396 --> 00:17:00,193 
what I'm messing around with you? 

231 
00:17:00,364 --> 00:17:01,991 
Plot? Charge? 

232 
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,726 
You just do not overdo it 
Mahoney. 

233 
00:17:04,902 --> 00:17:07,336 
This is a trick. Joke. Do you understand? 

234 
00:17:07,505 --> 00:17:11,305 
When we come out of the hotel 
You release us. 

235 
00:17:13,177 --> 00:17:14,804 
-You do it? 
"Of course. 

236 
00:17:14,979 --> 00:17:17,447 
Thank you, Mahoney, 
You are a true friend. 

237 
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,379 
-Are you okay? 
"Do not worry. 

238 
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,108 
I invite you all to dinner. 

239 
00:17:23,287 --> 00:17:25,915 
-Dining. 
-Come on, guys, get ready. 

240 
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:28,581 
Restaurant, Anton! 
-Are you crazy? 

241 
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:31,159 
No time for questions. 
You're hungry? 

242 
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:32,694 
And what about money? 

243 
00:17:32,863 --> 00:17:35,161 
We will arrange Mahoney 
small performance. 

244 
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,665 
You took a troupe of police? 

245 
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,997 
In some ways, yes. Come on. 

246 
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:44,005 
Well, well. Keep your distance. 

247 
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,829 
Elegant dinner. 

248 
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,729 
And like all tasty, yes? 

249 
00:18:10,901 --> 00:18:15,133 
Hey, France, your guys will be able to 
play "Reg-Half 1912 street"? 

250 
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:17,234 
Take the card. 

251 
00:18:17,408 --> 00:18:18,932 
Thank you. 

252 
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,134 
One on hand. 

253 
00:18:20,311 --> 00:18:23,337 
Will order dessert? 

254 
00:18:23,514 --> 00:18:25,505 
Naturally. 

255 
00:18:26,484 --> 00:18:27,815 
-What are we going? 
-We will see. 

256 
00:18:27,985 --> 00:18:30,613 
I'll be cookies "Alaska." 

257 
00:18:30,788 --> 00:18:32,915 
-How does it taste? 
-Sensational. 

258 
00:18:34,692 --> 00:18:35,954 
Two dollars. 

259 
00:18:36,127 --> 00:18:39,062 
But all the same? 
Can order a pair. 

260 
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,460 
-Cookie "Alaska." 
-Two servings. 

261 
00:18:41,632 --> 00:18:43,463 
-Choose? 
-Crepes Suzette. 

262 
00:18:43,634 --> 00:18:45,568 
"And me too. 
Jacques. 

263 
00:18:45,736 --> 00:18:49,172 
Two cookies "Alaska" 
and twice with pancakes. 

264 
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:53,943 
Crepes Suzette with us 
tasty and holodnenkie. 

265 
00:18:54,111 --> 00:18:58,275 
That is life. 
I said all I will build? 

266 
00:18:58,449 --> 00:19:01,782 
This is the first time 
you not mistaken. 

267 
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,188 
I have a minute. 

268 
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,494 
Excuse me. Sorry. 

269 
00:19:11,662 --> 00:19:13,493 
Excuse me, please. 

270 
00:19:25,476 --> 00:19:28,775 
-There is no thoroughfare. 
-Nothing, baby. 

271 
00:19:28,946 --> 00:19:31,506 
Cute, right? How you? 

272 
00:19:31,682 --> 00:19:34,207 
Why did you not tell him anything? 

273 
00:19:34,385 --> 00:19:36,649 
I'm not familiar with it. 

274 
00:19:40,357 --> 00:19:43,485 
Oh, I was greeted with illumination. 

275 
00:19:43,661 --> 00:19:46,289 
-Here I am. 
-Are you okay? 

276 
00:19:46,464 --> 00:19:48,694 
Fear not, Mahoney series. 

277 
00:19:54,872 --> 00:19:56,806 
Ok, Mahoney. 

278 
00:19:57,341 --> 00:19:58,672 
Get in the car, I change you. 

279 
00:19:58,843 --> 00:20:02,506 
Nothing, Elmer, I am for you otdezhuryu. 

280 
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,261 
It's kind of an evening stroll. 

281 
00:20:04,262 --> 00:20:05,843 
Stop fooling around 
and sit in the car. 

282 
00:20:06,016 --> 00:20:08,951 
Sergeant, I really do not want to - 
-Fast in the car! 

283 
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,747 
Yes, sir. 

284 
00:20:18,028 --> 00:20:21,794 
How much should chefs 
to cook it all. 

285 
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:25,527 
France, the remains can be wrapped? 
I'll take them to the dog. 

286 
00:20:25,703 --> 00:20:28,536 
You will take away a dog 
cookies "Alaska"? 

287 
00:20:28,706 --> 00:20:31,402 
Yes. I have a husky. 

288 
00:20:33,177 --> 00:20:35,270 
Funny. Funny! 

289 
00:20:35,446 --> 00:20:38,882 
The table, he is a genius. 
-I told you, sensationally. 

290 
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:42,177 
-Fascinating. 

291 
00:20:42,553 --> 00:20:46,785 
-When you're done, here's your check. 
-One moment. 

292 
00:20:47,124 --> 00:20:50,525 
$ 98 40 cents. 

293 
00:20:50,694 --> 00:20:52,286 
Absolutely. 

294 
00:20:52,596 --> 00:20:54,154 
Anton. 

295 
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,493 
How do you say in French: 

296 
00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:01,103 
"I have no money. 
I can not pay the check? 

297 
00:21:04,975 --> 00:21:07,535 
I have no money. 
I can not pay the check? 

298 
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,645 
That is, you can not pay. 

299 
00:21:09,814 --> 00:21:12,374 
-It can happen to anyone. 
"I do not understand. 

300 
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,279 
Then I say easier. 

301 
00:21:14,451 --> 00:21:17,477 
I'm broke. Penniless. 
I have no money. 

302 
00:21:17,655 --> 00:21:21,216 
-I need to call. 
-This is a fraud. Theft. 

303 
00:21:21,392 --> 00:21:23,417 
-I'll call the police. 
"What do you say? 

304 
00:21:23,594 --> 00:21:27,928 
-I said I'll call the police. 
"Do not bother. I myself will call. 

305 
00:21:28,098 --> 00:21:29,725 
Hap, you're crazy? 

306 
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,563 
Wait. I understood everything. 
Mahoney! 

307 
00:21:35,139 --> 00:21:37,539 
Sorry to bother again. 

308 
00:21:38,075 --> 00:21:41,476 
Do not spoil our reputation. 
Let's settle in another way. 

309 
00:21:41,645 --> 00:21:44,170 
None. You want the police, 
and I'll call the police. 

310 
00:21:44,348 --> 00:21:46,578 
-Police! 
-Do not make unnecessary problems. 

311 
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,876 
Take him away. 

312 
00:21:48,052 --> 00:21:49,883 
-Come with me. 
-Police! 

313 
00:21:50,054 --> 00:21:52,249 
Do not listen to him! 

314 
00:21:52,623 --> 00:21:55,456 
Wait a minute. 
Give me a glass of water. 

315 
00:21:55,626 --> 00:21:57,821 
Police. 

316 
00:21:57,995 --> 00:22:00,361 
Take him away! 

317 
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:04,160 
-Please. 
-Here it is. Hurry, please. 

318 
00:22:05,035 --> 00:22:06,024 
This is not Mahoney. 

319 
00:22:06,937 --> 00:22:10,566 
-What is the problem? 
-Arrest him. 

320 
00:22:10,741 --> 00:22:14,177 
The officer, make your case. 
Mahoney - 

321 
00:22:14,345 --> 00:22:16,745 
Remove from my hands. 
I have my own police. 

322 
00:22:16,914 --> 00:22:22,045 
Mahoney - I agreed. 
You know Mahoney? 

323 
00:23:36,727 --> 00:23:40,925 
-In the other door. 
"What's with the door -? 

324 
00:23:41,098 --> 00:23:43,862 
-Come in, you interfere. 
-Keep your hands off. 

325 
00:23:45,436 --> 00:23:48,269 
All right, all right. 

326 
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,365 
This did not work for the artist. 

327 
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:55,703 
I, Doug McGee, play 
front compartment with broccoli. 

328 
00:23:55,879 --> 00:23:58,347 
That's all you and your ideas. 

329 
00:23:58,515 --> 00:24:00,898 
I also do not like it here, 

330 
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:03,282 
but this is the most honest 
way to pay. 

331 
00:24:05,923 --> 00:24:08,824 
-Would you prefer jail? 
Yes. 

332 
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,850 
George, come on. 

333 
00:24:11,028 --> 00:24:12,825 
The menu does not match - 

334 
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:16,925 
Do not stand idle! 

335 
00:24:17,101 --> 00:24:20,764 
Will not rest until 
run for every penny. 

336 
00:24:20,938 --> 00:24:23,065 
Thieves! SCAM! 

337 
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,640 
Husky! 

338 
00:24:26,276 --> 00:24:30,440 
-So give him a mop. 
"And his head in a bucket. 

339 
00:24:30,614 --> 00:24:33,344 
Dishes, utensils! 
For what we are given arm? 

340 
00:24:33,517 --> 00:24:35,576 
Why not stop 
complain? 

341 
00:24:35,753 --> 00:24:39,985 
Another day of work, and the bill is paid. 
Finally, let us themselves. 

342 
00:24:40,157 --> 00:24:41,522 
"And where? 
Yes, where? 

343 
00:24:41,692 --> 00:24:43,785 
Snyder, a telegram. 

344 
00:24:43,961 --> 00:24:46,452 
-Thank you. I was waiting for her. 
-From whom? 

345 
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,877 
I sent a letter to the owner 
Hotel Max Briskin. 

346 
00:24:48,878 --> 00:24:51,124 
We have received an invitation. 

347 
00:24:51,301 --> 00:24:53,269 
Hap Snyder and Company 
straight from the world famous 

348 
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,237 
Hotel Tropical Palms 

349 
00:24:55,406 --> 00:24:57,931 
-Where do we clean up? 
-Perhaps you need money? 

350 
00:24:58,108 --> 00:25:01,805 
I have asked to send a hundred. 
I even offered to share in the show. 

351 
00:25:01,979 --> 00:25:06,746 
Listen. "I'm sorry, but this letter 
I never got it. Max Briskin. " 

352 
00:25:07,451 --> 00:25:10,045 
"I'm sorry, but this letter 
I never got it. " 

353 
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,710 
What to do. 

354 
00:25:11,889 --> 00:25:13,356 
I give up. 

355 
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:18,250 
-We would have lunch. 
-Who is able to eat? 

356 
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:20,954 
I never thought that 
received from him like that. 

357 
00:25:21,665 --> 00:25:24,259 
Get some fresh air. 

358 
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:30,601 
Cheer up, Hap. 

359 
00:25:30,774 --> 00:25:33,937 
I do not understand how Max 
could act 

360 
00:25:34,111 --> 00:25:36,909 
after I had 
many times he took a loan. 

361 
00:25:39,683 --> 00:25:43,016 
Hap may not be worth 
offer him a share of the show? 

362 
00:25:43,187 --> 00:25:44,586 
-What is the show? 
Yes, all is well. 

363 
00:25:44,755 --> 00:25:47,747 
Well, sorry, did not work. 
But you learned to haggle. 

364 
00:25:51,295 --> 00:25:53,593 
At this time we lost. 

365 
00:25:53,764 --> 00:25:56,494 
How can you say that? 

366 
00:25:56,667 --> 00:25:59,500 
Hap Snyder 
when I came to the show 

367 
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:02,195 
You said that these 
artists never give up. 

368 
00:26:02,372 --> 00:26:04,067 


369 
00:26:04,241 --> 00:26:06,971 
Now is exactly the same case. 

370 
00:26:07,144 --> 00:26:08,634 
But we are not defeated. 

371 
00:26:08,812 --> 00:26:10,512 
You know what I say? 

372 
00:26:10,513 --> 00:26:12,213 
This girl was a great artist, 
than any of you .. 

373 
00:26:12,382 --> 00:26:14,247 
You're right, baby. 

374 
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,009 
For what? 

375 
00:26:18,188 --> 00:26:19,849 
"You kissed me on the left ear. 
-So what? 

376 
00:26:20,023 --> 00:26:21,906 
And I have to kiss 
you to answer 

377 
00:26:21,907 --> 00:26:23,789 
and it will be disaster 
for many years. 

378 
00:26:25,095 --> 00:26:27,256 
Those who have much to say 
of happiness 

379 
00:26:27,431 --> 00:26:29,922 
it is always very small. 

380 
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:34,303 
no money in their pockets - 
assume nothing 

381 
00:26:34,471 --> 00:26:36,939 
played all the time, 

382 
00:26:37,107 --> 00:26:39,974 
And without bread 

383 
00:26:40,144 --> 00:26:45,707 
With each passing day 
our sufferings grow 

384 
00:26:45,883 --> 00:26:48,818 
But the actor does not know the word "death" </ i> 

385 
00:26:48,986 --> 00:26:50,453 
right 

386 
00:26:53,957 --> 00:26:57,017 
Great Expectations, 
great expectations 

387 
00:26:57,194 --> 00:26:58,957 
never played in the palaces 

388 
00:26:59,129 --> 00:27:03,065 
Never played at festivals 

389 
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:06,697 
Great Expectations, 
great expectations 

390 
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:10,431 
There were no photos 
in Sunday newspapers 

391 
00:27:10,607 --> 00:27:13,838 
We are tired of dragging suitcases 

392 
00:27:14,978 --> 00:27:19,005 
When George Cohen 
began to show business 

393 
00:27:19,183 --> 00:27:22,175 
That's what the Yankees said this: 

394 
00:27:22,352 --> 00:27:26,584 
"Smile while you can, 
until the curtain falls, 

395 
00:27:26,757 --> 00:27:29,487 
even if you die "

396 
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:33,357 
and whether the show 
failed if, 

397 
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:37,159 
We agree with the point of view 
Cohen. 

398 
00:27:37,334 --> 00:27:43,330 
And all our hopes 
come true 

399 
00:27:45,642 --> 00:27:48,634 
Great Expectations, 
great expectations 

400 
00:27:48,812 --> 00:27:50,507 
There were large orchestras 

401 
00:27:50,681 --> 00:27:54,777 
It was just a piano 

402 
00:27:55,385 --> 00:27:58,411 
Great Expectations, 
great expectations 

403 
00:27:58,589 --> 00:28:02,218 
Never heard about yourself 
"Sister, you're famous" 

404 
00:28:02,392 --> 00:28:05,293 
wonder how it - 
feel like a star? 

405 
00:28:05,462 --> 00:28:06,690 
Listen 

406 
00:28:06,863 --> 00:28:10,890 
to start reserve 
ticket to Hoboken 

407 
00:28:11,068 --> 00:28:14,333 
Five times a day of the show 

408 
00:28:14,504 --> 00:28:18,565 
Then break 
and all again in a circle 

409 
00:28:18,742 --> 00:28:21,438 
Back to the old Broadway 

410 
00:28:21,612 --> 00:28:25,104 
And so the days 

411 
00:28:25,282 --> 00:28:29,013 
Waiting for an agent, while coming. 

412 
00:28:29,186 --> 00:28:32,644 
and all your great hope 

413 
00:28:32,823 --> 00:28:36,850 
come true 

414 
00:28:38,729 --> 00:28:42,563 
and bad and good times 

415 
00:28:42,733 --> 00:28:46,362 
wait patiently on themselves 

416 
00:28:46,536 --> 00:28:49,972 
and your great, great expectations 

417 
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:54,543 
come true 

418 
00:28:55,612 --> 00:28:59,275 
My statue! Peel off the statue! 
Bumbling fools! 

419 
00:29:02,085 --> 00:29:04,280 
"We did not get destroyed the statue. 
-Sorry. 

420 
00:29:04,888 --> 00:29:06,116 
Vandals! 

421 
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:08,451 
Killer! 
-All right. 

422 
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:10,616 
Just a little glue ... 

423 
00:29:10,794 --> 00:29:13,024 
"You pay for the statue! 
-Go away. 

424 
00:29:13,196 --> 00:29:16,029 
You will stay here 
and work out every penny! 

425 

Every penny! 

426 
00:29:31,448 --> 00:29:33,575 
Remember this moonlit night, 

427 
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,810 
As the moon shines 

428 
00:29:36,987 --> 00:29:42,391 
doing something this evening 
Best for Love 

429 
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:48,020 
Tell the birds in the trees 
to sing louder 

430 
00:29:48,198 --> 00:29:53,636 
Let flowers spread 
scent of love 

431 
00:29:53,804 --> 00:29:55,829 
This is a ballad for the first act. 

432 
00:29:56,006 --> 00:29:57,098 
Yes, lovely room. 

433 
00:29:57,274 --> 00:30:01,677 
But the main theme, 
I have not finished it yet. 

434 
00:30:01,845 --> 00:30:03,779 
Will something like this. 

435 
00:30:05,315 --> 00:30:07,112 
me luck 

436 
00:30:07,284 --> 00:30:11,277 
Destiny works for me 
Nothing will knock me down 

437 
00:30:11,455 --> 00:30:12,820 
No 

438 
00:30:12,989 --> 00:30:14,251 
Because I am lucky 

439 
00:30:14,424 --> 00:30:16,892 
This is a quick, bright room. 
For the final. 

440 
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,789 
Well, Dick, good. 

441 
00:30:19,062 --> 00:30:22,862 
You wrote a great script. 
May be the best. 

442 
00:30:23,033 --> 00:30:26,434 
But who knows about it, 
if not a producer? 

443 
00:30:27,037 --> 00:30:29,369 
What do you mean? 
I'll be a producer. 

444 
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:32,303 
Fine. 
I'll no longer needed. 

445 
00:30:32,943 --> 00:30:34,501 
You're my agent or what? 

446 
00:30:34,678 --> 00:30:38,136 
I've had more hits 
on Broadway than anyone else. 

447 
00:30:38,315 --> 00:30:41,250 
I wrote two successful shows, 
and you know it. 

448 
00:30:41,418 --> 00:30:44,148 
Dick, I agree, you know 
as the author of hits, 

449 
00:30:44,321 --> 00:30:47,688 
but for the money bags, 
Dick Carson name means nothing. 

450 
00:30:47,858 --> 00:30:49,120 
Dick Carson! 

451 
00:30:50,394 --> 00:30:53,761 
Living Mr. Carson. 

452 
00:30:55,966 --> 00:30:58,059 
You need anything? 

453 
00:30:58,835 --> 00:31:02,498 
No, no. I just - yes. 

454 
00:31:02,672 --> 00:31:06,733 
If you put on a show, 
may find a role for me? 

455 
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:09,538 
I'm sorry, but 
Casting has not yet started. 

456 
00:31:09,713 --> 00:31:13,877 
"You could not wait in the lobby -? 
-You think I'm just a maid. 

457 
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:17,542 
I would first and thought. 
I made a mistake? 

458 
00:31:17,721 --> 00:31:19,621 
I am artist. 

459 
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,155 
Just from the tour 
I Paris beauty. 

460 
00:31:21,156 --> 00:31:22,520 
Flo Neely. 

461 
00:31:22,692 --> 00:31:24,887 
Heard of it? 
Play, sing, dance. 

462 
00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:27,655 
-I'll show you. 
-Wait a minute, young lady. 

463 
00:31:27,831 --> 00:31:29,526 
See. 

464 
00:31:34,771 --> 00:31:37,604 
This is probably a new service at the hotel. 

465 
00:31:37,774 --> 00:31:40,868 
Instead of TV 
sing and play in the rooms. 

466 
00:31:41,044 --> 00:31:44,036 
If you remove the carpet, 
will hear the dance. 

467 
00:31:53,457 --> 00:31:55,550 
I'm still juggling. 

468 
00:31:57,894 --> 00:31:59,725 
Poor girl. 

469 
00:32:00,797 --> 00:32:03,561 
It should not be dangerous, 
otherwise she would not be allowed to work. 

470 
00:32:03,733 --> 00:32:05,428 
Come down from heaven to earth. 

471 
00:32:05,602 --> 00:32:07,467 
Let's give up the script 
Lenu and Bartlitu. 

472 
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:09,333 
They have twice made 
hits for us. 

473 
00:32:09,506 --> 00:32:11,138 
They have twice made 
hits for himself. 

474 
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:12,771 
This is my script 
and my score. 

475 
00:32:12,943 --> 00:32:14,427 
And this is my success 
or my failure. 

476 
00:32:14,428 --> 00:32:15,912 
Nothing can stop me. 

477 
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:18,479 
-There is a problem. 
-What? 

478 
00:32:19,282 --> 00:32:21,147 
-Money. 
"Only what I hear. 

479 
00:32:21,318 --> 00:32:23,718 
Y Lena and Bartlita they are, 
and you do not. 

480 
00:32:23,887 --> 00:32:26,788 
Who do you give money? 
Where is this angel? 

481 
00:32:28,525 --> 00:32:31,187 
Hi, angel. 

482 
00:32:31,361 --> 00:32:33,659 
Hello, dear. 
I interrupted your conversation? 

483 
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:37,596 
Yes, yes, of course. 
In the middle of it. Come on. 

484 
00:32:38,101 --> 00:32:40,729 
Get to know this is my agent, 
Mr. Tommy Arthur. 

485 
00:32:40,904 --> 00:32:42,371 
This is Miss Lorraine Teyr. 

486 
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:45,007 
-Hello, Mr. Arthur. 
-Hello. 

487 
00:32:45,175 --> 00:32:47,973 
Her father, Otis Teyr. 

488 
00:32:48,144 --> 00:32:50,408 
The one who has 42 
oil wells? 

489 
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,810 
Forty-four. 
Morning has two more. 

490 
00:32:52,983 --> 00:32:57,750 
Perhaps he had expected this, but 
hardly hoped for twins. 

491 
00:32:59,089 --> 00:33:02,684 
Dick so much about you said that 
I think we already know. 

492 
00:33:02,859 --> 00:33:04,827 
He said that without you nowhere. 

493 
00:33:04,995 --> 00:33:07,987 
I'm afraid it will be so this time, 
Miss Teyr if - 

494 
00:33:08,164 --> 00:33:10,655 
If my father did not finance 
show that Dick wrote? 

495 
00:33:10,834 --> 00:33:13,894 
-Well ... 
-This is a good chance, Mr. Arthur. 

496 
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,538 
A very good chance. 

497 
00:33:16,873 --> 00:33:20,832 
I feel that I was alone. 
Glad to meet you, Miss Teyr. 

498 
00:33:21,011 --> 00:33:23,980 
You know, Dick - a talented guy. 

499 
00:33:24,147 --> 00:33:26,638 
-Really talented. 
-I think so too. 

500 
00:33:26,816 --> 00:33:28,340 
Goodbye, Mr. Arthur. 

501 
00:33:28,518 --> 00:33:30,884 
Yes, good-bye, Tommy. 

502 
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:36,452 
See ya. 

503 
00:33:38,261 --> 00:33:39,660 
Expensive? 

504 
00:33:39,829 --> 00:33:42,320 
-There is great news. 
-Yes? What? 

505 
00:33:42,499 --> 00:33:44,865 
I told my father about the show 
and he is interested. 

506 
00:33:45,035 --> 00:33:47,367 
Excellent. If he likes it, 
it will work. 

507 
00:33:47,537 --> 00:33:48,521 
On Friday evening, my father 
would be welcome. 

508 
00:33:48,522 --> 00:33:49,505 
on the day of birth. 

509 
00:33:49,673 --> 00:33:51,800 
The ideal case to 
You play their numbers. 

510 
00:33:51,975 --> 00:33:54,000 
Elegant idea. 

511 
00:33:54,177 --> 00:33:56,737 
All together, all happy 
all the fun. 

512 
00:33:56,913 --> 00:34:00,280 
-I do not know how to thank you. 
-Do you know? 

513 
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:03,248 
I mean, what do you 

514 
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,285 
a true friend. 

515 
00:34:06,056 --> 00:34:07,717 
Thank you and on this one. 

516 
00:34:07,891 --> 00:34:09,051 
What is it? 

517 
00:34:09,225 --> 00:34:11,989 
From my side it was 
not entirely disinterested. 

518 
00:34:12,162 --> 00:34:16,223 
It is my understanding that the show Carson - 
good investment. 

519 
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:17,957 
Yes, for my father. 

520 
00:34:18,134 --> 00:34:21,001 
But I'm not a player like him. 

521 
00:34:21,805 --> 00:34:24,330 
Come on, I clarified the picture. 

522 
00:34:24,507 --> 00:34:27,135 
Your father was a wealthy man, 

523 
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:30,211 
and he has a big business. 

524 
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:34,077 
As you said, he is a player. 

525 
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:39,313 
But not only that. 
He has a reputation for winning. 

526 
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:44,959 
He chose my show, 
because it is luck. 

527 
00:34:45,128 --> 00:34:46,857 
Because it is a victory. 

528 
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,965 
And not because you 
chose me. 

529 
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:51,657 
Understand? 

530 
00:34:51,835 --> 00:34:53,132 
Most have nothing to add. 

531 
00:34:53,303 --> 00:34:56,864 
-That is just business? 
-Oh, no, just - 

532 
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,838 
Not a very good feeling, 

533 
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,637 
when you realize that you 
want to use. 

534 
00:35:05,915 --> 00:35:07,980 
As long as you have not used, 

535 
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:10,045 
There is no reason 
upset. 

536 
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:14,316 
"You do not worry, Dick? 
No, Lorraine. 

537 
00:35:14,724 --> 00:35:17,716 
Just like when all 
cards thrown on the table. 

538 
00:35:17,894 --> 00:35:22,092 
Of course, dear. But this does not mean 
you have to play patience. 

539 
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,767 
Sure, I'm sure. 

540 
00:35:25,935 --> 00:35:29,302 
I tell you who it is. 
Dick Carson. 

541 
00:35:29,472 --> 00:35:30,905 
The famous composer? 
Yes. 

542 
00:35:31,074 --> 00:35:33,406 
-The guy that wrote hits? 
-In room 610. 

543 
00:35:33,576 --> 00:35:36,340 
He composes a new show 
and is going to produce myself. 

544 
00:35:36,513 --> 00:35:38,276 
-Casting is not it? 
-No. 

545 
00:35:38,448 --> 00:35:42,248 
Understand what that means? 
Show. Broadway show. 

546 
00:35:42,419 --> 00:35:46,185 
"And we could participate in it. 
-Our first real success. 

547 
00:35:46,356 --> 00:35:50,520 
-I bet it is our good fortune. 
-What are you all talking about? 

548 
00:35:50,694 --> 00:35:54,960 
-If you would just talk to him. 
"He is not so easy to talk to. 

549 
00:35:55,131 --> 00:35:56,814 
I tried to arrange it 
audition 

550 
00:35:56,815 --> 00:35:58,498 
and it seemed to me that he 
to me than anything cast. 

551 
00:36:03,106 --> 00:36:05,768 
Machine Mr. Carson. 

552 
00:36:08,211 --> 00:36:11,305 
I just got lucky. 

553 
00:36:28,298 --> 00:36:31,165 
Good kitty. 

554 
00:36:39,609 --> 00:36:40,633 
Well, all - 

555 
00:36:42,846 --> 00:36:45,041 
Fine. 

556 
00:36:48,752 --> 00:36:50,310 
-Are you okay, sir? 
Yes. All is well. 

557 
00:36:50,487 --> 00:36:52,955 
-Are you okay, ma'am? 
Yes, okay. 

558 
00:36:53,323 --> 00:36:56,349 
I'm afraid I'll have to send 
you home in a taxi. 

559 
00:36:56,526 --> 00:36:58,084 
-I now call. 
-Thank you. 

560 
00:36:58,261 --> 00:37:00,855 
-This is very bad. 
-Yeah. 

561 
00:37:01,965 --> 00:37:04,058 
How funny 
She did not even notice. 

562 
00:37:06,202 --> 00:37:09,399 
Did not happen anything 
can not be corrected for the money. 

563 
00:37:09,572 --> 00:37:11,301 
It always happens. 

564 
00:37:11,474 --> 00:37:13,669 
-Behind the wheel was a woman? 
No, a woman passenger. 

565 
00:37:13,843 --> 00:37:16,641 
Believe me, it's much worse. 
How long will the repair? 

566 
00:37:16,813 --> 00:37:19,247 
-A couple of days. 
-A couple of days? 

567 
00:37:19,415 --> 00:37:21,815 
I better call a taxi. 
I've got back to the hotel. 

568 
00:37:21,985 --> 00:37:24,453 
Take my car. 
I then take away. 

569 
00:37:24,621 --> 00:37:26,748 
Thank you. 

570 
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,691 
Not this one. 

571 
00:37:38,101 --> 00:37:39,728 
All safe. 

572 
00:37:40,003 --> 00:37:41,197 
Listen, I just remembered - 

573 
00:37:41,371 --> 00:37:44,204 
Does not look very, 
but runs like a dream. 

574 
00:37:47,911 --> 00:37:49,708 
Come here, folks. 

575 
00:37:49,879 --> 00:37:54,179 
Read his past, present 
and the future of the gypsy-fortune-teller. 

576 
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:56,318 
"She sees everything - how are you? 
-Fine. 

577 
00:37:56,486 --> 00:37:58,579 
Two coins? 
Right on you. 

578 
00:37:58,755 --> 00:38:00,746 
People, this is the place. 

579 
00:38:00,924 --> 00:38:05,554 
Come here, here 
happiness for everyone. 

580 
00:38:12,969 --> 00:38:15,062 
Be attentive, my child. 

581 
00:38:15,705 --> 00:38:19,766 
You have a time of great 
opportunities. 

582 
00:38:20,243 --> 00:38:23,940 
you on the edge of adventure. 

583 
00:38:24,113 --> 00:38:28,015 
Soon to you will be 
a mysterious stranger. 

584 
00:38:28,184 --> 00:38:30,482 
stranger to hold you 

585 
00:38:30,653 --> 00:38:34,384 
on your fate to luck. 

586 
00:38:35,491 --> 00:38:38,483 
Mysterious Stranger. 

587 
00:39:11,761 --> 00:39:12,955 
I? 

588 
00:39:14,264 --> 00:39:15,891 
Why? 

589 
00:39:16,232 --> 00:39:17,995 
Why what? 

590 
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:30,538 
-What have I? 
"You always walk on the streets 

591 
00:39:30,713 --> 00:39:32,237 
just such a manner? 

592 
00:39:35,418 --> 00:39:37,978 
I just hopped between the cracks. 

593 
00:39:38,321 --> 00:39:39,845 
Between the cracks? 

594 
00:39:40,023 --> 00:39:42,355 
Well, you know, jump through the crack, 
to escape hell. " 

595 
00:39:42,525 --> 00:39:44,823 
-Oh, yeah. 
-This is just silly superstition. 

596 
00:39:44,994 --> 00:39:47,121 
-I do not take it seriously. 

597 
00:39:47,297 --> 00:39:51,165 
And black cats do not believe me? 

598 
00:39:52,235 --> 00:39:54,703 
You saw how I went 
from your hotel? 

599 
00:39:54,871 --> 00:39:57,840 
-I was, so to speak, within reach. 
-Oh my God. 

600 
00:39:58,007 --> 00:40:00,635 
You know, you are dangerous to 
traffic. 

601 
00:40:01,377 --> 00:40:04,039 
Well, it certainly was not my fault. 

602 
00:40:04,213 --> 00:40:05,959 
If you look back, 
where you go, 

603 
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,705 
but not where I go - 

604 
00:40:07,884 --> 00:40:10,114 
By the way, where did you go? 

605 
00:40:10,286 --> 00:40:11,685 
I'm going back to the hotel. 

606 
00:40:11,854 --> 00:40:14,288 
Let us then'll drop. 

607 
00:40:14,457 --> 00:40:16,391 
No, thank you very much. 
You're very kind. 

608 
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:20,154 
Oh, nothing. Just when you 
in the car, I was safe. 

609 
00:40:21,397 --> 00:40:23,957 
Do not worry, you too 
will be safe. 

610 
00:40:24,233 --> 00:40:27,396 
I'm a little late. 

611 
00:40:43,553 --> 00:40:45,919 
Do you live in the hotel? 

612 
00:40:46,089 --> 00:40:47,920 
Yes. 

613 
00:40:48,191 --> 00:40:49,886 
On vacation here? 

614 
00:40:50,059 --> 00:40:52,721 
No, I work. 

615 
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,655 
And where is work? 

616 
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:58,596 
In the hotel. 

617 
00:40:59,168 --> 00:41:01,500 
Live in a hotel 
and work there? 

618 
00:41:01,671 --> 00:41:03,104 
Yes. 

619 
00:41:03,506 --> 00:41:06,031 
What do you do? 

620 
00:41:07,176 --> 00:41:10,043 
Well, now I'm 
I work in the kitchen. 

621 
00:41:13,249 --> 00:41:15,410 
There is nothing wrong 
work in the kitchen. 

622 
00:41:15,585 --> 00:41:18,918 
No, I do not think so. 
Just a little bit surprised - 

623 
00:41:19,088 --> 00:41:23,047 
You do not look like a girl 

624 
00:41:23,226 --> 00:41:25,353 
which works in the kitchen. 

625 

And what do you say about yourself? 

626 
00:41:28,698 --> 00:41:30,381 
You're also not found 
for auto mechanics. 

627 
00:41:30,382 --> 00:41:32,065 
But you're an auto mechanic. 

628 
00:41:33,102 --> 00:41:34,694 
Yes. 

629 
00:41:34,871 --> 00:41:37,066 
And one of the best. 

630 
00:41:46,382 --> 00:41:48,316 
By the way what's your name? 

631 
00:41:48,484 --> 00:41:50,418 
Williams. Candy Williams. 

632 
00:41:50,586 --> 00:41:51,917 
Candy Williams? 

633 
00:41:52,088 --> 00:41:53,851 
I like it. 

634 
00:41:55,658 --> 00:41:57,592 
It is beautiful here, right? 

635 
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,853 
I never imagined 
how beautiful Miami. 

636 
00:42:00,029 --> 00:42:01,860 
And even more beautiful at night. 

637 
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:03,965 
I can imagine. 

638 
00:42:04,734 --> 00:42:08,500 
Tell me, how much you 
depart from kitchenware -? 

639 
00:42:08,671 --> 00:42:10,935 
When do the job? 

640 
00:42:11,107 --> 00:42:12,734 
At nine in the evening. 

641 
00:42:12,909 --> 00:42:15,173 
We finish about the same. 

642 
00:42:15,344 --> 00:42:16,976 
This is what I thought - 

643 
00:42:16,977 --> 00:42:18,609 
If we encounter such 
in an unusual way - 

644 
00:42:18,781 --> 00:42:20,510 
this is destiny. 

645 
00:42:20,683 --> 00:42:23,584 
It would be good for us 
meet tonight. 

646 
00:42:23,753 --> 00:42:26,221 
Dinner, dancing, 
have fun. 

647 
00:42:26,722 --> 00:42:29,418 
No, I do not think that happens. 

648 
00:42:29,592 --> 00:42:31,526 
I hardly know you. 

649 
00:42:31,694 --> 00:42:34,060 
You are practically a stranger. 

650 
00:42:38,067 --> 00:42:40,365 
You are the stranger. 

651 
00:42:41,504 --> 00:42:44,837 
-The Mysterious Stranger. 
-I? 

652 
00:42:45,007 --> 00:42:46,838 
This is amazing. 

653 
00:42:47,543 --> 00:42:49,568 
I think, still beginning, 

654 
00:42:49,745 --> 00:42:52,908 
and then get to know better. 

655 
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:56,711 
Can think about the evenings? 

656 
00:42:56,886 --> 00:42:59,770 
Normally I refuse to, but 
because you are a stranger, 

657 
00:42:59,771 --> 00:43:02,654 
then with pleasure. 

658 
00:43:04,093 --> 00:43:07,290 
Yes, yes, so of course better. 

659 
00:43:07,463 --> 00:43:10,830 
-At nine o'clock? 
-Well, at nine. 

660 
00:43:25,581 --> 00:43:27,572 
Prior to the meeting. 

661 
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,183 
Prior to the meeting. 

662 
00:43:31,787 --> 00:43:35,120 
-Thank you for a lift. 
-You're welcome. 

663 
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:37,555 
-Goodbye. 
-Bye. Tell me ... 

664 
00:43:37,727 --> 00:43:39,752 
You do not even know my name. 

665 
00:43:39,929 --> 00:43:41,829 
-I know. 
-Do you know? 

666 
00:43:41,998 --> 00:43:44,000 
It is written on the door. 
I do not know how it is pronounced. 

667 
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,935 
EDDIE SCHEPANSKI 

668 
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,095 
Shizpanski? 

669 
00:43:47,537 --> 00:43:49,664 
-Schepanski. Yes. 

670 
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:53,536 
This is my last name - 
A name is not as complicated. 

671 
00:43:53,709 --> 00:43:55,176 
Eddie. 

672 
00:43:55,444 --> 00:43:57,002 
Eddie. 

673 
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:00,213 
-In the nine? 
B-nine. 

674 
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:03,314 
Do not forget? 

675 
00:44:03,486 --> 00:44:06,978 
Well, that is to say, 
extremely unlikely. 

676 
00:44:08,558 --> 00:44:10,924 
B-nine. 
B-nine. 

677 
00:44:45,628 --> 00:44:47,892 
The same Dick Carson! 

678 
00:44:48,064 --> 00:44:49,725 
-Come on. 
-I tell you. 

679 
00:44:49,899 --> 00:44:52,026 
-Are you sure? 
-Definitely. 

680 
00:44:52,201 --> 00:44:54,118 
How do you like? 
We think, as we would 

681 
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:56,035 
to meet with Carson, 
and Candy have already done it. 

682 
00:44:56,205 --> 00:44:58,867 
If Carson is that he 
makes a car mechanic? 

683 
00:44:59,041 --> 00:45:01,908 
Do not know what he was doing there, 
but I know it was him. 

684 
00:45:02,078 --> 00:45:04,046 
-I wonder at it - 
-Why? 

685 
00:45:04,213 --> 00:45:05,737 
Why surprised? 
Why? 

686 
00:45:05,915 --> 00:45:08,509 
-I do not think Candy knows who he is. 
"Of course knew. 

687 
00:45:08,684 --> 00:45:10,777 
If you would not know who he is, 
would not have gone. 

688 
00:45:10,953 --> 00:45:14,980 
Or do you think that Candy 
will go with anyone? 

689 
00:45:16,659 --> 00:45:18,320 
Or with anyone? 

690 
00:45:19,962 --> 00:45:21,827 
Or go? 

691 
00:45:26,068 --> 00:45:29,162 
Magnolias are fragrant. 

692 
00:45:29,605 --> 00:45:32,165 
You yourself as a magnolia. 

693 
00:45:32,808 --> 00:45:34,571 
-This is a perfume that you sent me. 
-Yes? 

694 
00:45:34,744 --> 00:45:36,371 
Like it? 

695 
00:45:37,013 --> 00:45:39,948 
By the way thank you very much 
for candy and flowers. 

696 
00:45:40,116 --> 00:45:42,209 
-It was so nice. 
-With pleasure. 

697 
00:45:42,385 --> 00:45:44,182 
"But should not have done. 
-Why? 

698 
00:45:44,353 --> 00:45:47,117 
I think it is too 
wasteful. 

699 
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:52,421 
You have such a hard- 
earn money. 

700 
00:45:53,296 --> 00:45:55,924 
Oh, yeah. 

701 
00:45:56,165 --> 00:45:59,760 
To work 
twelve hours a day. 

702 
00:46:00,636 --> 00:46:03,070 
Sometimes in the evenings I - 

703 
00:46:03,439 --> 00:46:06,602 
get out of the pit garage 
and I feel so tired, 

704 
00:46:06,776 --> 00:46:09,370 
the head is barely holding on. 

705 
00:46:11,447 --> 00:46:13,540 
You need more sleep at night. 

706 
00:46:13,716 --> 00:46:17,015 
-Too many meetings? 
-Date? I? 

707 
00:46:17,787 --> 00:46:22,087 
You can count on 
fingers of one hand. 

708 
00:46:23,225 --> 00:46:26,558 
Most romantic 
the case for me 

709 
00:46:26,729 --> 00:46:31,359 
is to find a hairpin 
in a strange gig. 

710 
00:46:33,402 --> 00:46:36,963 
And so tonight 
means so much to me. 

711 
00:46:37,139 --> 00:46:39,869 
Can not imagine how 
romantic lie like this, 

712 
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:42,600 
but not underneath the car. 

713 
00:46:43,646 --> 00:46:46,342 
And I like it cares. 

714 
00:46:46,949 --> 00:46:49,611 
Much water and no utensils. 

715 
00:46:49,785 --> 00:46:51,650 
Funny. 

716 
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:58,521 
But I do you 
do not quite understand. 

717
00:46:58,694 --> 00:47:01,026
-Really?
No, nothing bad

718
00:47:01,197 --> 00:47:02,630
Any work is good, but -

719
00:47:02,798 --> 00:47:05,289
This is a temporary job.

720
00:47:06,268 --> 00:47:08,395
I did something actress.

721
00:47:09,138 --> 00:47:10,605
You artist?

722
00:47:10,773 --> 00:47:12,798
-I am a singer.
Singer?

723
00:47:13,275 --> 00:47:16,642
Our troupe stranded,
and while we are working at the hotel.

724
00:47:16,812 --> 00:47:19,940
Oh, then that explains everything
about the girl.

725
00:47:20,116 --> 00:47:21,208
-What girl?

726
00:47:21,384 --> 00:47:23,352
A maid at the hotel, said,
that she was a dancer.

727
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:24,918
-Oh, this is Flo.
Flow?

728
00:47:25,087 --> 00:47:27,112
She is a dancer.
A very good way.

729
00:47:29,658 --> 00:47:33,219
-I am sure of it.
-And how do you know about Flo?

730
00:47:33,396 --> 00:47:37,423
By Dick Carson.

731
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:42,560
He lives in a hotel, this is my client.

732
00:47:42,872 --> 00:47:45,119
I heard him say
about this case

733
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,366
when I changed his oil.

734
00:47:47,543 --> 00:47:49,773
He laughed at her?

735
00:47:49,979 --> 00:47:54,040
No, Candy, you are wrong
think of Mr. Carson.

736
00:47:54,216 --> 00:47:56,684
It's a great guy.

737
00:47:57,686 --> 00:47:59,313
What's in it such a fine?

738
00:47:59,488 --> 00:48:03,219
He was polite, courteous,

739
00:48:03,392 --> 00:48:07,761
talented but not conceited.

740
00:48:08,731 --> 00:48:10,164
And why should he be
conceited?

741
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,191
I do not know, all those handsome.

742
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:16,201
Handsome?

743
00:48:16,372 --> 00:48:18,499
I'm sure he is working on this.

744
00:48:18,674 --> 00:48:22,303
Baths, hairdressing, solarium.

745
00:48:22,478 --> 00:48:25,072
If he was plowing in the garage
12 hours a day,

746
00:48:25,247 --> 00:48:27,374
it would look no better than you.

747
00:48:28,784 --> 00:48:29,773
Thank you, Candy.

748
00:48:30,553 --> 00:48:33,078
Shooting star!

749
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,123
Again, your superstition.

750
00:48:40,296 --> 00:48:44,062
You must close your eyes, think of
desire, and it will come true.

751
00:48:44,233 --> 00:48:45,723
I can prove that it is not true.

752
00:48:45,901 --> 00:48:47,567
How?

753
00:48:47,568 --> 00:48:49,234
I wish and
but it did not come true.

754
00:48:49,405 --> 00:48:51,396
And you close your eyes?

755
00:48:53,542 --> 00:48:57,273
If you close your eyes,
my wish will come true.

756
00:49:02,151 --> 00:49:03,618
Hey, a mechanic.

757
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:06,151
Hey, a mechanic.

758
00:49:09,058 --> 00:49:10,719
"What?"
-This is your truck on the road?

759
00:49:10,893 --> 00:49:13,919
Truck?

760
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:16,755
Yes, but what?
Then I was lucky.

761
00:49:16,932 --> 00:49:19,059
I am an Englishman. The car broke down.
I happened to see you -

762
00:49:19,235 --> 00:49:21,260
Man, I had finished the job.

763
00:49:21,437 --> 00:49:24,338
-I have a date with a young lady -
"But I have an accident.

764
00:49:24,507 --> 00:49:27,203
My wife at the airport.
I think it's carburetor.

765
00:49:27,376 --> 00:49:30,470
-Sorry, we are a young lady -
"Do not worry about me.

766
00:49:30,646 --> 00:49:33,342
-A man problem. Need help.
-Thank you, ladies.

767
00:49:33,516 --> 00:49:35,541
-Also I want to see
as you work.

768
00:49:35,718 --> 00:49:38,312
No, no. Not that.

769
00:49:38,487 --> 00:49:41,456
I get nervous when someone
worth of the soul.

770
00:49:41,624 --> 00:49:43,683
I'll be back soon.

771
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:49,392
-I'll pay you for the work.
-Watch for falling stars.

772
00:50:32,007 --> 00:50:38,435
I say the stars </ i>

773
00:50:39,315 --> 00:50:44,378

774
00:50:44,653 --> 00:50:49,716

I'm not mistaken? </ i>

780

illusion of it </ i>

-This is true love </ i>

782

What happens, </ i>

When the magic end? </ i>

00:51:51,954 --> 00:51:58,553
Can I die? </ i>

793
00:52:30,125 --> 00:52:35,563

I'm in love </ i>

804
00:53:54,042 --> 00:53:56,237
Mr. ...

805
00:53:56,812 --> 00:53:59,337
It seems to me that you
a decent man.

806
00:53:59,515 --> 00:54:01,142
I need you to say something.

807
00:54:01,316 --> 00:54:02,544
What is it?

808
00:54:02,718 --> 00:54:04,083
I'm not a mechanic.

809
00:54:04,253 --> 00:54:06,414
-You are not a mechanic?
-No. It's just a joke.

810
00:54:06,588 --> 00:54:09,557
I played the girl.
She thinks I'm a mechanic.

811
00:54:09,725 --> 00:54:11,022
Joke?

812
00:54:11,193 --> 00:54:13,320
Joke?
But here you all sorted out.

813
00:54:13,495 --> 00:54:16,555
-How now collect -
"Do not worry.

814
00:54:16,732 --> 00:54:18,359
I just wanted to help you.

815
00:54:18,534 --> 00:54:20,468
But in foreign cars
I do not understand.

816
00:54:20,469 --> 00:54:22,402
I'm afraid to scratch it.

817
00:54:22,571 --> 00:54:24,732
But what I do
with my Jaguar?

818
00:54:24,907 --> 00:54:27,637
Oh, yeah. That would suggest that.

819
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:29,937
Here is a coin.

820
00:54:30,112 --> 00:54:32,103
Call the British embassy.

821
00:54:33,015 --> 00:54:34,539
Hey.

822
00:54:35,184 --> 00:54:36,913
Hey!

823
00:54:39,521 --> 00:54:40,852
All finished?

824
00:54:41,023 --> 00:54:42,957
Well, as I put it,

825
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:44,891
he no longer needs
in my services.

826
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:47,358
You know what?
You just like the doctor.

827
00:54:47,563 --> 00:54:49,895
Helping people in emergencies
situations like this.

828
00:54:50,065 --> 00:54:52,295
Believe me, nothing special.

829
00:54:55,437 --> 00:54:57,268
Wait a minute.

830
00:54:57,673 --> 00:55:00,938
Before us so
rudely interrupted,

831
00:55:01,343 --> 00:55:04,437
my wish almost came true.

832
00:55:04,613 --> 00:55:06,171
Remember?

833
00:55:06,648 --> 00:55:09,082
Close your eyes.

834
00:55:54,363 --> 00:55:55,921
-You are one of the guests?
-No.

835
00:55:56,098 --> 00:55:59,727
-I am looking for Dick Carson.
Dick Carson? He did not make an order.

836
00:55:59,902 --> 00:56:01,836
Oh, here they are.

837
00:56:03,205 --> 00:56:06,299
Eddy Schepanski. That's what I want -
-Oh, look who's here.

838
00:56:06,475 --> 00:56:08,807
What a coincidence.
Excuse me, brother.

839
00:56:08,977 --> 00:56:11,639
I was looking for you around the city,
while you're here.

840
00:56:11,813 --> 00:56:13,576
-Are you okay?
-Candy, and Come.

841
00:56:13,749 --> 00:56:16,343
Introduce me to Mr. Carson.
Continuing with our show.

842
00:56:16,518 --> 00:56:18,247
, Mr. Carson?
-Okay, I did.

843
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:22,948
I Hap Snyder.
Oh, do not get up. I do not like.

844
00:56:23,125 --> 00:56:25,821
-You are lucky, Mr. Carson.
-Hap, you're crazy?

845
00:56:25,994 --> 00:56:28,428
-This is not Mr. Carson. That -
-Do not Dick Carson?

846
00:56:28,597 --> 00:56:31,157
Of course not.
Eddie Carson, a car mechanic.

847
00:56:31,333 --> 00:56:33,324
-Candy, if you -
-This is Eddie Schepanski.

848
00:56:33,502 --> 00:56:35,561
-Sche-who-ski?
-Schepanski.

849
00:56:35,737 --> 00:56:37,466
-Schepanski?
-Candy, listen to me.

850
00:56:37,639 --> 00:56:39,038
Play well, yes?

851
00:56:39,207 --> 00:56:41,732
Portray sort of
Schepanskogo-gentry?

852
00:56:41,944 --> 00:56:44,777
A good way to meet
with a young girl, huh?

853
00:56:44,947 --> 00:56:47,108
-Depicts an honest mechanic.
-Wait.

854
00:56:47,282 --> 00:56:49,546
-What are you talking -?
"I know this whole process.

855
00:56:49,718 --> 00:56:52,016
Invite to dinner.
Poite champagne.

856
00:56:52,187 --> 00:56:55,384
Lonely moonlight.
Or is it already?

857
00:56:55,557 --> 00:56:57,923
Too big man
to call your name?

858
00:56:58,093 --> 00:56:59,651
And I have for you a name.

859
00:56:59,828 --> 00:57:01,693
Only his utter shame
in front of ladies.

860
00:57:01,863 --> 00:57:04,957
As for the new show,
we will not fall.

861
00:57:05,133 --> 00:57:06,896
-Come here.
-Wait a minute.

862
00:57:07,069 --> 00:57:09,299
Take your hands. Sorry, Eddie.

863
00:57:09,471 --> 00:57:12,702
Eddie? Good, smart, go ahead.
Tell her your real name.

864
00:57:12,874 --> 00:57:14,466
Out there in the corner.

865
00:57:15,877 --> 00:57:20,075
Candy got a misunderstanding.

866
00:57:20,282 --> 00:57:23,012
All the time I tried to explain.

867
00:57:24,219 --> 00:57:27,347
Ladies and gentlemen,
We are pleased to see among the guests

868
00:57:27,522 --> 00:57:31,288
wonderful composer
whose melodies delight us all.

869
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:33,724
Mr. Dick Carson.

870
00:57:39,101 --> 00:57:41,069
Candy, Candy, listen.

871
00:57:41,236 --> 00:57:42,828
I know how you feel.
I will explain.

872
00:57:43,005 --> 00:57:44,984
I have not started it.

873
00:57:44,985 --> 00:57:46,964
You yourself agreed that I
Eddie Schepanski.

874
00:57:47,142 --> 00:57:49,269
Naturally, I decided
you Eddie Schepanski.

875
00:57:49,444 --> 00:57:52,845
-I agree that it is you start?
Yes, I am. And you have not reassured.

876
00:57:53,015 --> 00:57:54,880
This is a misunderstanding.

877
00:57:54,881 --> 00:57:56,746
And you're wrong about my
respect thereto.

878
00:57:56,918 --> 00:57:59,614
Of course. All confirmed
Your reputation.

879
00:57:59,788 --> 00:58:02,222
-Reputation.
-Look, Candy.

880
00:58:02,391 --> 00:58:05,417
It started as a joke
but went on by itself.

881
00:58:05,594 --> 00:58:08,495
You're in show business,
should understand the humor.

882
00:58:08,663 --> 00:58:10,790
I have a great sense of humor,
Mr. Carson.

883
00:58:10,966 --> 00:58:14,367
-Candy, listen.
-True, I sometimes sentimental.

884
00:58:14,536 --> 00:58:17,266
Candy -

885
00:58:32,988 --> 00:58:34,285
I was terribly uncomfortable.

886
00:58:34,456 --> 00:58:37,357
You feel uncomfortable?
And I like?

887
00:58:37,726 --> 00:58:39,887
It is all in me.

888
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:44,130
-Good morning, Mr. Carson.
-Good morning.

889
00:58:44,299 --> 00:58:46,233
Here please.

890
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:53,805
I'll take it.

891
00:58:57,546 --> 00:59:00,913
See? Always at work.

892
00:59:02,818 --> 00:59:04,843
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.

893
00:59:05,153 --> 00:59:07,018
Very stylish look.

894
00:59:07,189 --> 00:59:10,625
No need to applause.
I can not stand the noise in the morning.

895
00:59:10,792 --> 00:59:13,192
-How do our business?
-Worked with it all morning.

896
00:59:13,361 --> 00:59:15,420
He told me about you.
Your entire history.

897
00:59:15,597 --> 00:59:17,258
-About your glory of your talent.
-Good.

898
00:59:17,432 --> 00:59:19,400
How did you start working
still in college.

899
00:59:19,568 --> 00:59:22,731
How hard it was.
Spoke about the military records.

900
00:59:22,904 --> 00:59:25,805
How much do you give to
charity.

901
00:59:25,974 --> 00:59:28,636
-I told her everything.
-So what?

902
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:30,641
She hates you.

903
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,404
Do not go.

904
00:59:33,849 --> 00:59:35,612
Pass her a note.

905
00:59:39,087 --> 00:59:41,419
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.

906
00:59:44,759 --> 00:59:46,158
Postman.

907
00:59:46,328 --> 00:59:50,287
Specially for Miss Candy
Dick Williams of Carson.

908
00:59:51,299 --> 00:59:53,733
-Here is my answer.
-Wait. What are you doing?

909
00:59:53,902 --> 00:59:56,928
"You deny it?
Listen, I'm sorry.

910
00:59:57,105 --> 00:59:58,732
Yes, but -
-Wait a minute.

911
00:59:58,907 --> 01:00:00,534
Candy is absolutely right.

912
01:00:00,709 --> 01:00:03,507
This is his first show. Location
we know that it happens?

913
01:00:03,678 --> 01:00:06,238
We need to do your own show.
We know what can.

914
01:00:06,414 --> 01:00:07,779
Of course, when all work it out.

915
01:00:07,949 --> 01:00:10,713
Babes, I have a number
for the second act.

916
01:00:10,886 --> 01:00:14,583
When the restaurant closes
porepetiruem under the piano.

917
01:00:14,756 --> 01:00:16,724
Believe me, once you start
working again

918
01:00:16,892 --> 01:00:19,884
feel himself a millionaire.
-I am sure.

919
01:00:20,061 --> 01:00:23,963
-And I'll take Mr. Carson answered.
-Thanks, Hap.

920
01:00:34,843 --> 01:00:37,311
No one. Come.

921
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,871
Prepare props.

922
01:00:43,051 --> 01:00:46,452
Candy, see your text.

923
01:00:47,255 --> 01:00:50,019
Come here. Naduy balls.

924
01:01:02,938 --> 01:01:05,805
Excuse me, miss Teyr,
Mr. Carson did not respond.

925
01:01:06,608 --> 01:01:08,269
Want to leave a message?

926
01:01:08,443 --> 01:01:10,570
No, I've tried.

927
01:01:10,745 --> 01:01:12,713
Thank you very much.

928
01:01:18,687 --> 01:01:21,349
The children, all ready?

929
01:01:22,757 --> 01:01:24,554
Let's begin.

01:01:24,726 --> 01:01:27,661
So. One, two, three, four.

01:01:37,906 --> 01:01:42,934
Pipers silenced in the Valley </ i>

932
01:01:43,111 --> 01:01:48,048
Sandy McTavish

933
01:01:48,216 --> 01:01:53,017
He is far from the flowers,
that once bloomed bright </ i>

934
01:01:53,188 --> 01:01:58,922
But the bells of Broadway
ring through the night </ i>

935
01:02:02,097 --> 01:02:06,932
He sits on the stage
with bare knees </ i>

936
01:02:07,102 --> 01:02:11,903
Around him a crowd of girls,
and he plays the bagpipes </ i>

"Oh, what a guy in a skirt!" </ I>

He is far from the heather,

Oh, tell me, where the left

until it becomes like a rock </ i>

953
01:04:36,317 --> 01:04:41,118
It compresses goat skin
and it turns jazz </ i>

954
01:04:41,289 --> 01:04:45,726
Sandy - Star
DIPS-Doodle-five. </ I>

Candy, you're just gorgeous.

961
01:05:16,090 --> 01:05:19,685
Hap-how could you?
-Candy.

962
01:05:20,395 --> 01:05:22,727
I told you that she
gorgeous?

963
01:05:27,936 --> 01:05:29,164
Candy.

964
01:05:29,337 --> 01:05:30,565
Candy, wait!

965
01:05:30,738 --> 01:05:32,103
Candy.

966
01:05:32,307 --> 01:05:34,036
Hear me out.

967
01:05:34,976 --> 01:05:36,876
Candy. Candy.

968
01:05:41,649 --> 01:05:43,640
What kind of obsession?

969
01:05:43,818 --> 01:05:45,979
Princeton, Number 1948.

970
01:05:46,154 --> 01:05:47,781
Still play, an athlete?

971
01:05:47,956 --> 01:05:49,150
Candy, well, listen.

972
01:05:49,390 --> 01:05:51,483
-Let go.
"You should listen to me.

973
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:53,990
Yesterday evening, a wonderful
superstitious girl

974
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:55,520
named Candy Williams

975
01:05:55,697 --> 01:05:57,494
Walked with a guy who
impersonate another,

976
01:05:57,495 --> 01:05:59,292
and now she hates him.

977
01:05:59,467 --> 01:06:03,028
-Absolutely.
So, forget those two.

978
01:06:03,204 --> 01:06:06,230
Talk about a producer who
going to put on a show.

979
01:06:06,407 --> 01:06:08,807
He saw the girl and would like to
use it in his show.

980
01:06:08,977 --> 01:06:11,445
We can talk
about these two people?

981
01:06:11,613 --> 01:06:14,514
I do not know what you have for the show,
Mr. Carson,

982
01:06:14,682 --> 01:06:17,031
but you're the producer, playboy

983
01:06:17,032 --> 01:06:19,381
and trying to ohmurit naive girl

984
01:06:19,554 --> 01:06:22,352
taking it in her show,

985
01:06:22,524 --> 01:06:25,118
I'm already too old for this.

986
01:06:25,293 --> 01:06:27,352
But Candy -

987
01:06:29,364 --> 01:06:31,355
You'd better get up,
Mr. Carson.

988
01:06:31,533 --> 01:06:34,661
You can catch a cold
without the car over you.

989
01:06:34,836 --> 01:06:35,825
Hear.

990
01:06:36,004 --> 01:06:37,670
How would you have to do with me,

991
01:06:37,671 --> 01:06:39,337
do not be so stubborn.

992
01:06:39,507 --> 01:06:43,603
It's not often offer
soloist in the Broadway show.

993
01:06:43,778 --> 01:06:46,372
Thank you very much.

994
01:06:50,952 --> 01:06:52,214
Solo?

995
01:06:52,387 --> 01:06:55,083
If you can.
And I know - you can.

996
01:06:55,256 --> 01:06:58,157
-How about Hepa and the rest?
-Everyone can find a role.

997
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:02,024
But this is just business,
Mr. Carson.

998
01:07:02,196 --> 01:07:04,756
Yes, Miss Williams,
just business.

999
01:07:05,667 --> 01:07:07,897
Oh, Mr. Carson.

1000
01:07:10,772 --> 01:07:14,173
That's why I want to sing like an angel </ i>

1001
01:07:14,342 --> 01:07:17,209
And dance like the devil </ i>

1002
01:07:17,378 --> 01:07:23,339
So gather the orchestra, Mr.
conductor, and let's begin </ i>

1003
01:07:24,285 --> 01:07:26,617
"Well, Tommy, what do you think?
-Sensational.

1004
01:07:26,788 --> 01:07:28,784
With our search methods
Talents

1005
01:07:28,785 --> 01:07:30,781
You could stay
undisclosed.

1006
01:07:30,959 --> 01:07:32,557
Undisclosed? Wait a minute.

1007
01:07:32,558 --> 01:07:34,156
She was in my show,
"Parisian Beauty."

1008
01:07:34,329 --> 01:07:35,956
-So what it saw.
However, very little.

1009
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:40,328
It was opened by Hap Snyder.
He made it great.

1010
01:07:40,501 --> 01:07:43,527
If you would like it Teyru,
we get the money.

1011
01:07:43,705 --> 01:07:45,434
Oh, I hope.

1012
01:07:45,607 --> 01:07:48,542
-Come on.
"Do not worry, you ocharuesh it.

1013
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:50,507
How, you say, he
oil wells?

1014
01:07:50,678 --> 01:07:52,612
Forty-four.
Forty-four.

1015
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:55,647
Forty-four.
-Oil. Black gold.

1016
01:07:55,817 --> 01:07:57,580
Guys, guys.

1017
01:07:57,752 --> 01:08:00,152
'll Work on the ballad.

1018
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:09,391
-It must be sung at a good pace.
-Good.

1019
01:08:09,564 --> 01:08:11,725
And I think that should be slower.

1020
01:08:11,899 --> 01:08:15,699
Slightly corny.
Something like this:

1021
01:08:15,870 --> 01:08:19,636
I love you dearly,
more than just - </ i>

1022
01:08:19,807 --> 01:08:21,798
Flow is not exactly
that I had in mind.

1023
01:08:21,976 --> 01:08:25,104
No, no.
Need a nice easy rhythm:

1024
01:08:25,346 --> 01:08:28,179
I love you dearly - </ i>

1025
01:08:28,349 --> 01:08:31,443
Okay, okay.
Stop, right?

1026
01:08:31,619 --> 01:08:33,587
Let the one who wrote the song,

1027
01:08:33,755 --> 01:08:35,387
explain to a girl
who will sing a song

1028
01:08:35,388 --> 01:08:37,020
as the one who wrote the song,

1029
01:08:37,191 --> 01:08:39,671
wants a girl
who will sing a song

1030
01:08:39,672 --> 01:08:42,151
sang this song.
Understand?

1031
01:08:42,964 --> 01:08:45,364
-Forward.
-Thank you.

1032
01:08:49,203 --> 01:08:50,192
Too slow.

1033
01:08:50,371 --> 01:08:53,772
The song needs a drive.
See what I mean?

1034
01:08:53,941 --> 01:08:55,203
I love you dearly - </ i>

1035
01:08:55,376 --> 01:08:56,604
more than just - </ i>

1036
01:08:56,778 --> 01:08:58,040
Listen, if you do not mind -

1037
01:08:58,212 --> 01:08:59,679
I'm better alone.
Please.

1038
01:08:59,847 --> 01:09:02,247
I will work in another room,

1039
01:09:02,417 --> 01:09:04,112
away from you.

1040
01:09:04,285 --> 01:09:06,150
Understood.

1041
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,413
They are you nervous about?
I will bring them.

1042
01:09:08,589 --> 01:09:11,080
Flow, we're going.
Up! Gone, gone.

1043
01:09:11,259 --> 01:09:15,696
Well done. Duc, an!
Go on, guy.

1044
01:09:15,863 --> 01:09:19,390
Fish. Fish for the boy.
Gone, gone.

1045
01:09:19,634 --> 01:09:22,330
When they came to me,
nothing could.

1046
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:29,638

Candy, it's wonderful.

1077
01:12:05,933 --> 01:12:07,332
That -

1078
01:12:12,179 --> 01:12:14,579
It's just wonderful.

1079
01:12:14,748 --> 01:12:18,650
But not good enough.
It should be more dynamic.

1080
01:12:18,819 --> 01:12:22,016
In the end, on stage
I can not help you.

1081
01:12:22,189 --> 01:12:24,714
You'll be singing themselves,
unaided.

1082
01:12:24,892 --> 01:12:27,122
Yes, I know, Dick, but I do not -
-Mr Carson.

1083
01:12:27,328 --> 01:12:31,230
Let's keep your distance.
Do not be too ambitious.

1084
01:12:31,398 --> 01:12:35,926
Lorraine!

1085
01:12:36,103 --> 01:12:37,092
Come on.

1086
01:12:37,271 --> 01:12:41,105
Lorraine, I want to present to you
Miss Williams.

1087
01:12:41,275 --> 01:12:42,640
Miss Candy Williams.

1088
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:47,543
This is Miss Teyr.
Miss Lorraine Teyr.

1089
01:12:47,815 --> 01:12:50,409
-Hello, Miss Teyr.
-Hello.

1090
01:12:50,584 --> 01:12:54,748
Today we did a good job.
Continue to work the same way.

1091
01:12:54,922 --> 01:12:59,450
Rehearse in front of a mirror,
In the morning I go in with you.

1092
01:13:01,195 --> 01:13:03,527
You now have learned a lot.

1093
01:13:03,864 --> 01:13:06,958
I did too much today
learned.

1094
01:13:12,072 --> 01:13:14,233
Well, Lorraine, how?

1095
01:13:17,278 --> 01:13:20,304
-I have two days I can not find you.
-Really? Very sorry.

1096
01:13:20,481 --> 01:13:24,178
"I do not know you were busy casting.
CAST -? Oh, yes, casting.

1097
01:13:24,351 --> 01:13:27,684
That's what I was doing.
Very, very hard work.

1098
01:13:27,855 --> 01:13:31,416
Lorraine, listen, I
great idea.

1099
01:13:31,592 --> 01:13:33,719
-As for this girl, this ...
-Williams?

1100
01:13:33,894 --> 01:13:35,759
-Candy Williams?
Yes. Yes.

1101
01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:38,831
Tommy so many leads,
I do not remember.

1102
01:13:38,999 --> 01:13:40,398
Yeah.

1103
01:13:41,235 --> 01:13:42,930
Lorraine, listen.

1104
01:13:43,103 --> 01:13:45,162
This girl - dynamite.
Straight dynamite.

1105
01:13:45,339 --> 01:13:49,002
Of course, I do not want it to
know what I think about it.

1106
01:13:49,243 --> 01:13:51,677
So what is the mind.

1107
01:13:51,845 --> 01:13:54,678
At the reception, your father,
instead of me sitting at the piano,

1108
01:13:54,848 --> 01:13:56,878
singing songs and trying to
show voice

1109
01:13:56,879 --> 01:13:58,909
how they will look
on stage

1110
01:14:00,287 --> 01:14:02,505
will this girl sing,

1111
01:14:02,506 --> 01:14:04,724
and your father will be able to see

1112
01:14:04,892 --> 01:14:08,988
how it will look
in reality.

1113
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:12,763
This will be a hundred times more
effectively, is not it?

1114
01:14:12,933 --> 01:14:15,868
-Do you agree?
Dick, you're a genius.

1115
01:14:16,036 --> 01:14:19,494
It is not only more efficient
way to listen to songs,

1116
01:14:19,673 --> 01:14:21,937
but we still see love
Is it this girl ..

1117
01:14:22,109 --> 01:14:23,906
That's right.
-And if all is well,

1118
01:14:24,078 --> 01:14:26,876
The father agreed to her
major role in the show.

1119
01:14:27,047 --> 01:14:28,810
I myself have thought of before.

1120
01:14:28,983 --> 01:14:32,146
At first, my only interest
was to help put on a show,

1121
01:14:32,353 --> 01:14:35,220
and now - to take part
the fate of a young,

1122
01:14:35,389 --> 01:14:38,017
budding actress.
Help her achieve fame.

1123
01:14:38,192 --> 01:14:42,788
This is a fantastic idea.
Just fabulous.

1124
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:46,365
Now, when I heard the words,
Give me some music.

1125
01:14:46,533 --> 01:14:49,832
If this dishwasher close
to my father, I will destroy her.

1126
01:14:50,004 --> 01:14:53,496
Lorraine, you are unfair.
The show should be a girl.

1127
01:14:53,674 --> 01:14:55,505
-Not this one.
"Why not?

1128
01:14:57,478 --> 01:14:59,969
You have a lot of it just promise?

1129
01:15:00,147 --> 01:15:01,409
Well, I'll be frank.

1130
01:15:01,582 --> 01:15:03,573
Or I or this blond.

1131
01:15:03,751 --> 01:15:06,151
And if not me,
there will be no pope.

1132
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,947
And would not the pope, will not show.

1133
01:15:08,122 --> 01:15:09,851
"But Lorraine -
-Think, Dick.

1134
01:15:10,024 --> 01:15:12,925
-Call me at home.
-Lorraine -

1135
01:15:13,093 --> 01:15:15,084
Oh, my God -

1136
01:15:18,499 --> 01:15:20,262
Excuse me.

1137
01:15:25,539 --> 01:15:26,938
Candy.

1138
01:15:27,107 --> 01:15:28,768
Candy.

1139
01:15:30,244 --> 01:15:31,336
Candy.

1140
01:15:31,512 --> 01:15:33,844
Candy, I came as soon as he could.

1141
01:15:34,014 --> 01:15:38,849
I do not want you to
incorrectly thought ...

1142
01:15:39,153 --> 01:15:41,951
Hey, Candy, it was a joke.

1143
01:15:42,189 --> 01:15:44,419
I would like to introduce you
Lorraine as an artist.

1144
01:15:44,591 --> 01:15:48,288
I did not want her to think,
that between us something personal.

1145
01:15:48,462 --> 01:15:51,693
Between us, nothing personal
Mr. Carson.

1146
01:15:51,865 --> 01:15:55,096
Why are you so? From Lorraine
depends on funding. You know.

1147
01:15:55,269 --> 01:15:58,397
-I do not know that depends on it.
-She is jealous proprietress.

1148
01:15:58,572 --> 01:16:01,632
-It is not so bad.
-Not in this case ...

1149
01:16:01,809 --> 01:16:03,293
She does not want you to sing
in her home.

1150
01:16:03,294 --> 01:16:04,778
She does not want to -?

1151
01:16:04,945 --> 01:16:08,574
This I refuse to sing
in her home.

1152
01:16:08,749 --> 01:16:11,274
Why are you so?
You're all wrong understanding -

1153
01:16:11,452 --> 01:16:13,477
Jealous-proprietress?
Yes.

1154
01:16:13,654 --> 01:16:16,589
Tuck did not file her cause.
-I did not let on. Hear me out.

1155
01:16:16,757 --> 01:16:20,090
I'm sure you said:
"It's just business, nothing more."

1156
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:22,524
You'll never believe this,
I said.

1157
01:16:22,696 --> 01:16:24,857
I'm sure you said so.
I did not know men

1158
01:16:25,032 --> 01:16:27,500
but good to know women.
-Candy, fires -

1159
01:16:27,668 --> 01:16:30,398
They do not get jealous
proprietress without -

1160
01:16:30,571 --> 01:16:33,165
without that there was no
for good reason.

1161
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:37,208
Candy, listen, wait -
Lorraine, please -

1162
01:16:39,513 --> 01:16:42,038
Candy. Candy!

1163
01:16:43,650 --> 01:16:44,639
Wait.

1164
01:16:44,818 --> 01:16:48,151
-This is not the Princeton College.
-Okay, but listen to me.

1165
01:16:48,322 --> 01:16:52,156
Something that was between me and Lorraine,
was before I met you.

1166
01:16:52,326 --> 01:16:54,157
Candy, it's true.

1167
01:16:54,328 --> 01:16:55,920
Candy.

1168
01:16:56,897 --> 01:16:58,364
Candy, I love you.

1169
01:16:58,532 --> 01:16:59,999
Anyone but you.

1170
01:17:00,167 --> 01:17:02,032
And it is also true.

1171
01:17:02,202 --> 01:17:04,796
If you say you love me
why not say it's Lorraine

1172
01:17:04,972 --> 01:17:08,305
instead of having to humiliate me?
-I tried. Did not happen.

1173
01:17:08,475 --> 01:17:12,206
"She sees even what is not.
"She knows you too well.

1174
01:17:12,379 --> 01:17:13,403
Candy -

1175
01:17:23,023 --> 01:17:26,151
Candy just like a child, yes?
The very immediacy.

1176
01:17:26,326 --> 01:17:28,294
More so you will not find anywhere else -

1177
01:17:32,466 --> 01:17:34,593
Candy, my dear -

1178
01:17:39,072 --> 01:17:42,701
What I'm saying. Immediacy.
See what I mean?

1179
01:17:42,876 --> 01:17:45,344
Nervous. You understand
when you're nervous, you -

1180
01:17:45,512 --> 01:17:49,471
This does not mean it's -
Well, you know? That -

1181
01:17:49,983 --> 01:17:52,383
Well at least not a cake.

1182
01:17:52,553 --> 01:17:53,952
Sorry.

1183
01:18:02,162 --> 01:18:04,027
Honey, what -? Wait. That's me.

1184
01:18:04,198 --> 01:18:06,359
What happened to you?
What happened between you?

1185
01:18:06,533 --> 01:18:09,798
I do not understand. First
cake, then a slap.

1186
01:18:09,970 --> 01:18:12,200
Why not just kill him
and does not end this show?

1187
01:18:12,372 --> 01:18:15,432
-There will be no show.
"Do not be a show? Why?

1188
01:18:15,609 --> 01:18:18,908
Oil does not want to miss me
Here's why.

1189
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:23,479
"Rehearsing before a mirror."

1190
01:18:23,684 --> 01:18:26,881
Cheater!

1191
01:18:28,121 --> 01:18:31,784
Hey, what's wrong with you?
The same misfortune for seven years.

1192
01:18:32,259 --> 01:18:34,727
Let there be fourteen.

1193
01:18:37,331 --> 01:18:39,765
Maybe try a 21?

1194
01:18:46,106 --> 01:18:48,666
All right, dear.
All right, dear.

1195
01:18:49,409 --> 01:18:52,344
I never knew you had it
love so much.

1196
01:19:10,764 --> 01:19:14,393
Please, show
small service Anton.

1197
01:19:14,835 --> 01:19:17,360
Do not touch anything.
Go away quietly.

1198
01:19:17,537 --> 01:19:21,769
And please, do not come back.

1199
01:19:30,917 --> 01:19:32,748
Well it's here.

1200
01:19:32,919 --> 01:19:34,409
Alcatraz.

1201
01:19:34,588 --> 01:19:37,284
Do not worry, we've worked well.
Can be proud.

1202
01:19:37,457 --> 01:19:39,618
Wait a minute.
Why do not we go back

1203
01:19:39,793 --> 01:19:43,490
Back to Broadway
and there they show in the kitchen?

1204
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:53,831
Hey, look.

1205
01:19:56,443 --> 01:19:59,844
-Hopefully see you soon, Dick.
-Thank you. See you soon.

1206
01:20:02,082 --> 01:20:05,074
He is probably going to receive
sing for her excellent Lorraine.

1207
01:20:09,456 --> 01:20:11,686
Tommy. Tommy!

1208
01:20:14,261 --> 01:20:16,559
And you do not go along with it?

1209
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,857
No, I need to overtake him
machine in New York.

1210
01:20:19,032 --> 01:20:22,058
After what he did with Candy
I wish him a failure.

1211
01:20:22,235 --> 01:20:26,001
There will be no failure, no success.
He refused to show.

1212
01:20:26,273 --> 01:20:28,002
He refused to show?

1213
01:20:28,175 --> 01:20:31,201
So, he leaves -?
"He went to the airport.

1214
01:20:31,378 --> 01:20:33,608
"He flies to New York.
-What happened?

1215
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:35,714
How do I know?
He suddenly said,

1216
01:20:35,715 --> 01:20:37,648
did not want to put on a show
in Florida.

1217
01:20:37,818 --> 01:20:41,686
Spends his last 150 bucks
ticket and flies away.

1218
01:20:41,855 --> 01:20:43,015
So he lied.

1219
01:20:43,190 --> 01:20:44,680
About what?

1220
01:20:44,858 --> 01:20:46,189
He loves me.

1221
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:48,760
So this is it because of you fly away?

1222
01:20:48,929 --> 01:20:51,454
Because I hurt his feelings
and did not believe him.

1223
01:20:51,631 --> 01:20:55,226
Do not blame yourself. Could it be
Lorraine gave him a ticket -

1224
01:20:55,402 --> 01:20:57,233
No, he flies away
from Lorraine.

1225
01:20:57,404 --> 01:20:59,372
He threw everything, because
loves me.

1226
01:20:59,539 --> 01:21:02,872
-Fine. And what do I do?
-What to do?

1227
01:21:03,043 --> 01:21:05,011
I know what I do.

1228
01:21:05,245 --> 01:21:07,839
Whatever happens, we are with you.
We still troupe.

1229
01:21:08,014 --> 01:21:10,414
-Where are you going?
"I want to see Mr. Teyra.

1230
01:21:10,584 --> 01:21:13,747
-Teyra?
"She was crazy. If Lorraine

1231
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,047
see it, then run.
-Candy. Candy.

1232
01:21:21,094 --> 01:21:23,528
Candy, not so fast.
Listen to me.

1233
01:21:23,697 --> 01:21:26,165
If we Frenchman catches,
We psycho in solitary confinement.

1234
01:21:26,333 --> 01:21:28,415
The last time I tell you.
If there was a possibility

1235
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:30,497
receive money to stage,
then it's gone.

1236
01:21:30,670 --> 01:21:33,195
This lady knows you.

1237
01:21:33,373 --> 01:21:35,398
"She never -
"She knows me.

1238
01:21:38,145 --> 01:21:41,205
But does not know it.

1239
01:21:55,095 --> 01:21:57,256
Lorraine, my first dance.

1240
01:21:57,431 --> 01:22:00,923
I can remember. Mrs. Herbert
glad to see you again.

1241
01:22:01,101 --> 01:22:03,592
-Thank you, dear.
-Good evening.

1242
01:22:03,770 --> 01:22:06,238
Marjorie.
-Hi.

1243
01:22:06,907 --> 01:22:08,135
Arthur.
Yes, Miss Teyr?

1244
01:22:08,308 --> 01:22:09,673
-Is everything ready?
Yes.

1245
01:22:09,843 --> 01:22:11,640
Pro-lighting is not forgotten?
-No.

1246
01:22:11,812 --> 01:22:13,143
Well.

1247
01:22:15,715 --> 01:22:18,775
-Ask them to stop the music
Yes, ma'am.

1248
01:22:18,952 --> 01:22:20,442
-Pope.
Yes, dear?

1249
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:23,214
-Excuse us, please.
"Of course.

1250
01:22:25,792 --> 01:22:28,226
Please post here.

1251
01:23:07,934 --> 01:23:10,459
-Happy birthday, Dad.
-Thank you, dear.

1252
01:23:10,637 --> 01:23:11,865
Happy birthday, Otis.

1253
01:23:12,038 --> 01:23:14,165
-Congratulations, Otis.
-Thank you.

1254
01:23:14,341 --> 01:23:16,639
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

1255
01:23:16,810 --> 01:23:19,938
-All the best.
-Thank you very much.

1256
01:23:20,614 --> 01:23:22,479
Otis, which I have not seen.

1257
01:23:22,649 --> 01:23:23,911
It's really something.

1258
01:23:24,084 --> 01:23:26,484
A bit pretentious
I would say.

1259
01:23:26,653 --> 01:23:28,314
This idea of Lorraine.

1260
01:23:28,488 --> 01:23:31,548
Maybe someday it will cease
brag about my money

1261
01:23:31,725 --> 01:23:34,922
but I can brag about
his daughter.

1262
01:23:46,673 --> 01:23:49,665
What is the liveliest,
True, my lady?

1263
01:23:49,843 --> 01:23:51,071
Yes, my lord.

1264
01:23:51,244 --> 01:23:53,769
Excuse me, my lord and my lady

1265
01:23:53,947 --> 01:23:55,915
I wish you personally
welcome.

1266
01:23:56,082 --> 01:23:58,073
It's so rare to find fellow countryman.

1267
01:23:58,251 --> 01:23:59,548
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1268
01:23:59,719 --> 01:24:02,347
How do you find London
these days?

1269
01:24:02,522 --> 01:24:07,152
Oh, easy, easy.
The fog clears, and there he is here.

1270
01:24:07,394 --> 01:24:10,227
Contrary to what everyone says,
we have a sense of humor.

1271
01:24:10,397 --> 01:24:11,659
Yes.

1272
01:24:15,669 --> 01:24:17,660
-Your hat, my lord.
"Of course, this is my hat.

1273
01:24:17,837 --> 01:24:20,635
Whose hat is it then?
He thinks it's not my hat.

1274
01:24:31,151 --> 01:24:33,210
-Duc, I'm afraid.
-Oh, nonsense.

1275
01:24:33,386 --> 01:24:35,684
Draws in his lips and all.

1276
01:24:35,855 --> 01:24:37,686
Take me by the arm.

1277
01:24:38,692 --> 01:24:41,456
An excellent evening, right?

1278
01:24:41,628 --> 01:24:42,856
Enormously.

1279
01:24:43,029 --> 01:24:44,997
Just tremendous.

1280
01:24:48,401 --> 01:24:50,528
-I beg your pardon.
-Oh, hello, sir?

1281
01:24:50,704 --> 01:24:52,069
My name is Lord Belford.

1282
01:24:52,238 --> 01:24:54,035
-Can I offer you a drink?
Yes, of course.

1283
01:24:54,207 --> 01:24:56,835
I'll be whiskey and soda.
But no ice.

1284
01:24:57,010 --> 01:24:58,443
And ma'am?

1285
01:24:58,612 --> 01:25:02,104
Whiskey and soda.
But without the whiskey.

1286
01:25:03,049 --> 01:25:05,381
Her Serene Highness the wheel.

1287
01:25:07,587 --> 01:25:11,546
Would you like to eat?

1288
01:25:11,758 --> 01:25:13,749
Wish.

1289
01:25:25,138 --> 01:25:27,732
-Who are they?
"Who?"

1290
01:25:27,907 --> 01:25:29,169
Do you know them?

1291
01:25:29,342 --> 01:25:31,867
This is probably friends of his father.

1292
01:25:32,779 --> 01:25:34,747
Turn away. It goes.

1293
01:25:35,548 --> 01:25:37,982
-Good evening. I Miss Teyr.
-Lord Belford.

1294
01:25:38,151 --> 01:25:40,381
-I would like to submit a lady Belford.
-Hello.

1295
01:25:40,553 --> 01:25:43,215
I'm glad you came.
I hope you enjoy the evening.

1296
01:25:43,390 --> 01:25:45,551
Oh, it's divine.

1297
01:25:45,725 --> 01:25:49,388
Almost like when Their Lordships
and I got married.

1298
01:25:49,562 --> 01:25:51,792
Probably very interesting
to be the wife of Lord.

1299
01:25:51,965 --> 01:25:53,489
Just try.

1300
01:25:53,667 --> 01:25:55,464
That is going beyond the Lord.

1301
01:25:55,635 --> 01:25:58,001
Excuse me.

1302
01:26:05,378 --> 01:26:07,505
-What does it far, so good.

1303
01:26:11,918 --> 01:26:15,081
My name is Rogers.
My business - oil.

1304
01:26:15,488 --> 01:26:16,546
How are you?

1305
01:26:16,723 --> 01:26:19,886
That I was dead, it's
Lord and Lady Belford!

1306
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:22,255
Hi, guys. Hi all.

1307
01:26:22,429 --> 01:26:23,987
Hi all.

1308
01:26:24,164 --> 01:26:26,962
"Do not expect to meet you here.
-The world is small, does not it?

1309
01:26:27,133 --> 01:26:30,125
Yes, very small. Not like Texas.

1310
01:26:30,303 --> 01:26:33,397
Hey, Betty Lou, come here,
old mare.

1311
01:26:33,573 --> 01:26:34,904
I'm here, my sweet.

1312
01:26:35,075 --> 01:26:37,600
You all know this little girl.
Texas Flower.

1313
01:26:37,777 --> 01:26:40,109
My little cactus.

1314
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:43,477
"How then is it going?
-I give my best performance -

1315
01:26:43,650 --> 01:26:44,776
We fooled everyone.

1316
01:26:44,951 --> 01:26:47,044
Even Lorraine. She is over there.

1317
01:26:49,289 --> 01:26:52,053
-One fly in the ointment?
-This is just a fly.

1318
01:26:52,225 --> 01:26:53,692
So would prishlepnula.

1319
01:26:53,860 --> 01:26:56,954
You know what to do.
I take Teyra.

1320
01:26:57,130 --> 01:27:00,190
-Your hand, my lady.
Yes, my lord.

1321
01:27:00,967 --> 01:27:03,595
-And here did not dance?
-What are the dance?

1322
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:06,432
Here, elegant public.
Watch your language.

1323
01:27:06,606 --> 01:27:09,473
What are you talking about?
I say like everyone else.

1324
01:27:09,642 --> 01:27:11,610
Even better.

1325
01:27:11,778 --> 01:27:13,678
How are you? All right?

1326
01:27:13,847 --> 01:27:16,145
-I see, okay. The cool kids.
Yes, sir.

1327
01:27:16,316 --> 01:27:19,183
I'll give everyone a herd of cows.
How about this?

1328
01:27:19,352 --> 01:27:20,614
Good?

1329
01:27:21,221 --> 01:27:22,882
Arthur ...

1330
01:27:23,223 --> 01:27:26,784
-Mr Carson has not come yet?
-Not yet, Miss Teyr.

1331
01:27:28,495 --> 01:27:30,861
If you do not mind, I am too.

1332
01:27:34,167 --> 01:27:37,500
This is the dry martini
of those that I drank.

1333
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:40,901
Do not worry. All right.

1334
01:27:41,341 --> 01:27:43,502
Friends, for the oil business.

1335
01:27:43,676 --> 01:27:45,906
I, too, all in oil, you know.
Terms of an oil.

1336
01:27:46,079 --> 01:27:49,276
It makes me rich.
But I want to start a hobby.

1337
01:27:49,449 --> 01:27:53,078
I want to do something else.
Well, playing golf, for example.

1338
01:27:53,253 --> 01:27:54,834
Decided is how to build something
golf course.

1339
01:27:54,835 --> 01:27:56,416
And guess what happened?

1340
01:27:56,589 --> 01:27:59,387
18 oil fountains. How do you?

1341
01:27:59,559 --> 01:28:01,527
You are a fine fellow, Teyr.
I like you.

1342
01:28:01,694 --> 01:28:04,254
People such as you have done
Texas what it is.

1343
01:28:04,430 --> 01:28:05,761
And like you.

1344
01:28:05,932 --> 01:28:08,150
It's good you say, pal.

1345
01:28:08,151 --> 01:28:10,369
You are right. All heard
what he said?

1346
01:28:10,537 --> 01:28:13,973
Like me. The same steep.
I clearly say?

1347
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:16,165
You are from the North?

1348
01:28:16,576 --> 01:28:18,806
A great honor to meet you,
Your Grace.

1349
01:28:18,978 --> 01:28:21,742
-Thank you. HSH -
"Why throw the child -?

1350
01:28:21,915 --> 01:28:24,577
Oh, let me introduce
our good friend,

1351
01:28:24,751 --> 01:28:26,616
Mrs. Rogers from Texas.

1352
01:28:26,786 --> 01:28:28,617
-Hello. How are you?
-I am fascinated.

1353
01:28:28,788 --> 01:28:30,949
"We met at the coronation.
-At the coronation?

1354
01:28:31,124 --> 01:28:33,490
Oh, it certainly was
stunner.

1355
01:28:33,660 --> 01:28:37,562
Of course. Even the queen was.

1356
01:28:39,165 --> 01:28:41,292
Glad to meet you, Mrs. Winston.

1357
01:28:41,801 --> 01:28:43,428
Oh, all right.

1358
01:28:43,603 --> 01:28:46,094
I always carry a spare.

1359
01:28:47,774 --> 01:28:50,902
-What brought you to Florida?
-Just thought of something to buy.

1360
01:28:51,077 --> 01:28:55,013
I want to buy Miami, you know?

1361
01:28:55,181 --> 01:28:57,945
Otis, what you said,
old devil?

1362
01:28:58,117 --> 01:29:00,085
We need to find Lorraine.

1363
01:29:00,253 --> 01:29:02,949
And I told how I
was Penhendle?

1364
01:29:03,122 --> 01:29:04,316
It was - yes -

1365
01:29:04,490 --> 01:29:07,516
And how about a little dance?

1366
01:29:09,529 --> 01:29:11,224
All right, sir?

1367
01:29:12,065 --> 01:29:14,659
This is because of the shoes.
I used to bear boots.

1368
01:29:22,976 --> 01:29:24,841
-Once again, repeat.
"Yes, miss.

1369
01:29:25,011 --> 01:29:27,241
You have to stay, dear.

1370
01:29:27,413 --> 01:29:28,971
I know that I do, Dad.

1371
01:29:29,148 --> 01:29:31,116
Carson this yet?

1372
01:29:31,284 --> 01:29:33,411
"He will be soon.
-Lorraine, listen.

1373
01:29:33,586 --> 01:29:36,919
I intend to invest big money
to this guy for you.

1374
01:29:37,090 --> 01:29:39,854
But please do not lose
him as the others.

1375
01:29:40,026 --> 01:29:42,426
Do not worry, I'll take care of your
precious investment.

1376
01:29:42,595 --> 01:29:44,324
-Honey, I have no doubt -
-Lorraine.

1377
01:29:44,497 --> 01:29:46,897
-You promised me a dance.
-Oh, of course.

1378
01:29:47,066 --> 01:29:48,761
Excuse me, sir.

1379
01:30:01,648 --> 01:30:05,243
Well, I think now is the
time to start.

1380
01:30:05,418 --> 01:30:06,510
Completely, my lady.

1381
01:30:06,686 --> 01:30:08,586
You know what to do?

1382
01:30:10,089 --> 01:30:12,990
-Shall we dance, my lord?

1383
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:23,831
-Excuse me, miss Teyr.
-No, my lady.

1384
01:30:39,252 --> 01:30:41,720
-I am away for a minute?
Yes, of course.

1385
01:31:39,479 --> 01:31:42,107
Miss Teyr,
You just passed.

1386
01:31:50,523 --> 01:31:51,683
How are things going?

1387
01:31:51,858 --> 01:31:53,223
On the right track.

1388
01:31:53,393 --> 01:31:55,486
What are you doing? ..

1389
01:32:02,535 --> 01:32:04,901
-How are things going?
-How does the current.

1390
01:32:36,102 --> 01:32:38,536
You can drum roll?

1391
01:32:41,574 --> 01:32:45,169
Ladies and gentlemen,
minute attention.

1392
01:32:46,179 --> 01:32:49,410
As you know, Mr. Teyr
asked Dick Carson,

1393
01:32:49,582 --> 01:32:54,383
renowned composer, to
He sang songs from his shows.

1394
01:32:54,554 --> 01:32:57,284
However, Mr. Carson
unexpectedly delayed.

1395
01:32:57,790 --> 01:33:00,350
And I would like to replace it,
As far as I can.

1396
01:33:00,927 --> 01:33:02,451
With your permission,
Mr. Teyr.

1397
01:33:02,628 --> 01:33:04,994
Of course, young lady.
Start.

1398
01:33:05,164 --> 01:33:06,756
Thank you very much.

1399
01:33:07,333 --> 01:33:11,360
Arthur, place the public
Sit back.

1400
01:33:11,838 --> 01:33:13,499
Sorry.

01:33:24,350 --> 01:33:26,375
you ever wondered </ i>

for which I was born </ i>

1409
01:33:56,949 --> 01:33:58,917
-Oh, Mr. Carson.

I want to sing </ i>

1411
01:34:04,557 --> 01:34:06,184

I want to be where the lights </ i>

And dance like the devil </ i>

1436
01:35:55,668 --> 01:35:56,862
Started! </ i>

1437
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:11,177
-Delightfully, young lady!.
-Thank you, Mr. Teyr.

1438
01:36:11,917 --> 01:36:15,353
-Want to hear the rest of the troupe?
-I heard all I needed to hear.

1439
01:36:15,521 --> 01:36:17,113
Son, will work.

1440
01:36:17,290 --> 01:36:19,383
-Thank you, Mr. Teyr.
"You put on a show?

1441
01:36:19,558 --> 01:36:21,321
I guarantee you.

1442
01:36:21,494 --> 01:36:23,428
I just have
blank form and a pen.

1443
01:36:23,596 --> 01:36:25,962
Will you sign a check?

1444
01:36:26,132 --> 01:36:27,360
Of course.

1445
01:36:27,533 --> 01:36:28,727
Wait a minute, Dad.

1446
01:36:30,536 --> 01:36:31,696
What is it -?

1447
01:36:31,871 --> 01:36:33,862
-Where were you?
-In the pool.

1448
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:35,064
All with their drinking.

1449
01:36:35,241 --> 01:36:37,004
-I told you to stay?
"But she -

1450
01:36:37,176 --> 01:36:40,236
If we begin to show business,
that is no reason for you to

1451
01:36:40,413 --> 01:36:42,313
show your character.

1452
01:36:42,314 --> 01:36:44,213
It is a pity that you have not heard
how this girl sings.

1453
01:36:44,383 --> 01:36:46,465
She's just adorable.

1454
01:36:46,466 --> 01:36:48,547
Everything is ready to deal with your
friend Dick Carson.

1455
01:36:48,721 --> 01:36:50,951
You can forget about Carson
and about the show.

1456
01:36:51,123 --> 01:36:53,819
You were misled.

1457
01:36:53,993 --> 01:36:55,961
"But I -
-It was my fault, Mr. Teyr -

1458
01:36:56,128 --> 01:36:57,459
Do not, Candy -

1459
01:36:59,065 --> 01:37:01,932
Someone explain to me
what is happening here?

1460
01:37:02,101 --> 01:37:05,696
Mr. Teyr, I certify
that you were misled.

1461
01:37:05,871 --> 01:37:07,634
But not as it seems.

1462
01:37:07,807 --> 01:37:11,174
I would like to hear from you only
investments in the entertainment business.

1463
01:37:11,344 --> 01:37:12,777
And nothing more.

1464
01:37:12,945 --> 01:37:15,971
I talked about this with your daughter,
but did not discuss with you.

1465
01:37:16,148 --> 01:37:17,877
It was my mistake.

1466
01:37:18,818 --> 01:37:22,117
Carson, we're probably better
discuss this situation

1467
01:37:22,288 --> 01:37:23,755
at other times.

1468
01:37:23,923 --> 01:37:26,858
This would not be necessary.
Good night.

1469
01:37:27,026 --> 01:37:28,493
Candy -

1470
01:37:42,975 --> 01:37:44,169
Candy.

1471
01:37:44,343 --> 01:37:45,503
Dick, leave me alone.

1472
01:37:45,678 --> 01:37:47,805
Do not cry, dear. Please.

1473
01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:49,379
Nothing happened.

1474
01:37:49,548 --> 01:37:52,449
Yes it is.
I spoiled you all -

1475
01:37:52,618 --> 01:37:54,882
You do not spoil.

1476
01:37:55,054 --> 01:37:57,579
When I left, I thought
I lost

1477
01:37:57,757 --> 01:38:01,750
everything in this world.
I do not care about this show.

1478
01:38:01,927 --> 01:38:03,155
True.

1479
01:38:03,462 --> 01:38:06,590
If you need to become a mechanic,
as Schepanski, I agree.

1480
01:38:06,766 --> 01:38:08,734
All I need is you.

1481
01:38:09,068 --> 01:38:10,831
I love you, Candy.

1482
01:38:11,003 --> 01:38:13,130
I will always love you.

1483
01:38:16,442 --> 01:38:18,069
I apologize.

1484
01:38:18,244 --> 01:38:20,371
We ought to talk about show business.

1485
01:38:20,546 --> 01:38:23,709
I like what I see
but here in Texas,

1486
01:38:23,883 --> 01:38:25,447
if we want something,

1487
01:38:25,448 --> 01:38:27,011
do not waste time and do not delay.

1488
01:38:27,186 --> 01:38:30,212
Teyr, I'm the same player
Like you, sir.

1489
01:38:30,389 --> 01:38:35,417
Carson, I am willing to invest
hundred thousand in your show.

1490
01:38:35,594 --> 01:38:37,323
Stough -?
-Calm down.

1491
01:38:37,496 --> 01:38:39,760
You are not allowed to
This bouncer took the show?

1492
01:38:39,932 --> 01:38:40,990
Of course not.

1493
01:38:41,167 --> 01:38:42,794
Carson.

1494
01:38:43,035 --> 01:38:46,027
I give 125 000.

1495
01:38:46,238 --> 01:38:48,001
-It can not be -
-This is wonderful.

1496
01:38:48,174 --> 01:38:50,074
Raise rates.

1497
01:38:50,242 --> 01:38:53,871
I give 150 thousand.

1498
01:38:56,115 --> 01:38:59,846
Carson, as necessary, to
put on a show?

1499
01:39:00,019 --> 01:39:03,785
From 150 to 175 thousand.

1500
01:39:05,491 --> 01:39:07,516
Young lady, where the checkbook?

1501
01:39:10,129 --> 01:39:15,692
-Here, Mr Teyr.
Vaught, 175 thousand dollars.

1502
01:39:15,868 --> 01:39:18,336
-Procedure.
Dick.

1503
01:39:18,537 --> 01:39:21,370
Two hundred thousand dollars.

1504
01:39:21,807 --> 01:39:23,104
Well ...

1505
01:39:23,275 --> 01:39:25,675
You won. I pass.

1506
01:39:26,679 --> 01:39:29,079
Wait a minute, Mr. Teyr.

1507
01:39:30,349 --> 01:39:33,250
We sang for you in your home.

1508
01:39:33,419 --> 01:39:37,378
And we accept your 175,000.

1509
01:39:37,790 --> 01:39:41,157
In addition, we believe in ethics.

1510
01:39:45,464 --> 01:39:46,829
Rogers?

1511
01:39:50,269 --> 01:39:52,737
Yield to the young lady. I pass.

1512
01:39:52,905 --> 01:39:54,736
Well, if the transaction was executed.

1513
01:39:54,907 --> 01:39:56,374
