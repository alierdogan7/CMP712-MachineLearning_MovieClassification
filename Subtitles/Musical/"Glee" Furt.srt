1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,359
Here's what you missed on Glee:

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,281
Kurt's still getting harassed and
doesn't know what to do about it.

3
00:00:03,282 --> 00:00:04,300
I am gonna kill you.

4
00:00:04,301 --> 00:00:06,140
Finn and Kurt got mad 
at each other, because Kurt had

5
00:00:06,141 --> 00:00:08,095
a crush on Finn, and then
Finn called him a nasty name,

6
00:00:08,096 --> 00:00:09,954
but it also wasn't cool that
Kurt couldn't take a hint,

7
00:00:09,955 --> 00:00:11,853
and their parents are dating,
so it's a little awkward.

8
00:00:11,854 --> 00:00:13,007
Sam and Quinn are sort of dating,

9
00:00:13,008 --> 00:00:14,209
and Sue sort of dated Rod Remington.

10
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,625
You sunk my battleship,

11
00:00:15,626 --> 00:00:17,527
Rod, and you sunk it hard.

12
00:00:17,528 --> 00:00:19,486
But then she caught him cheating,
so she's back on the market,

13
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:21,278
and that's what you
missed on Glee.

14
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:31,876
Oh. What's going on?

15
00:00:32,336 --> 00:00:33,928
Is this one of those
interventions, 'cause...?

16
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:35,308
If it is, it's for the both of us.

17
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:37,253
They bombarded me and forced
me to bring them to you.

18
00:00:37,254 --> 00:00:38,205
Okay, come on, tell 'em.

19
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:38,994
- No, no, no, you.
- Come on.

20
00:00:38,995 --> 00:00:40,073
No. We said in the car.

21
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:40,815
Come on, you, you.

22
00:00:40,816 --> 00:00:41,584
- Come on, you.
- Please!

23
00:00:41,585 --> 00:00:44,906
All right, so you know how I drive
Carole to work every Tuesday?

24
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:47,277
Well, today I drove here,

25
00:00:47,278 --> 00:00:50,659
and we snuck into that classroom
where Kurt introduced us...

26
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,450
very romantic of me,
I might add... And I...

27
00:00:53,451 --> 00:00:54,892
He proposed! He proposed!

28
00:00:54,893 --> 00:00:56,334
You stole the punch line!

29
00:00:56,588 --> 00:00:57,564
Come on!

30
00:00:57,565 --> 00:00:59,093
Wow. This just happened?

31
00:00:59,094 --> 00:01:00,420
Oh, Dad!

32
00:01:00,634 --> 00:01:02,539
Oh! We wanted the two of you
to be the first to know.

33
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,031
Yeah, after the kids
in that homeroom.

34
00:01:04,032 --> 00:01:05,996
Come on, family hug, huh?

35
00:01:05,997 --> 00:01:07,060
Okay. Come on!

36
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:11,677
I'm so excited and-and nervous!

37
00:01:11,678 --> 00:01:12,877
- Oh, don't be, don't be.
- Well, no. Okay.

38
00:01:12,878 --> 00:01:14,307
Oh, my God, this is
just what I needed.

39
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:15,669
I will take care of it from here.

40
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,626
I have a trunk full of wedding
magazines hidden under my bed.

41
00:01:18,627 --> 00:01:21,490
I'm thinking of a
russet and cognac theme.

42
00:01:21,491 --> 00:01:23,456
Those are colors, Finn.
Fall wedding colors.

43
00:01:23,457 --> 00:01:24,070
Autumnal.

44
00:01:24,071 --> 00:01:25,515
Nothing too extravagant,
Kurt, okay?

45
00:01:25,516 --> 00:01:26,761
We're gonna use whatever
savings we have.

46
00:01:26,762 --> 00:01:28,369
We are spending it
on the honeymoon.

47
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,895
That's right.
We're going to Waikiki.

48
00:01:29,896 --> 00:01:30,770
We're gonna go to the hotel

49
00:01:30,771 --> 00:01:32,387
where they put up the
guest stars on Lost.

50
00:01:32,388 --> 00:01:34,292
Finn, you-you haven't
said anything.

51
00:01:34,293 --> 00:01:35,699
Uh, I'm...

52
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,407
I guess I'm just kind of stunned.

53
00:01:37,517 --> 00:01:39,743
Hey, don't worry. I'm already
looking for a bigger house.

54
00:01:39,744 --> 00:01:42,016
One where everybody's gonna get
their own rooms. All right?

55
00:01:42,017 --> 00:01:44,488
Come on, honey. Be happy for me.

56
00:01:46,805 --> 00:01:47,974
I am, Mom.

57
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:49,209
All right, now listen, Kurt,

58
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,947
Mr. Wedding Planner, I want
you to take care of one thing.

59
00:01:50,948 --> 00:01:53,225
I don't care about the food
or the booze at this party,

60
00:01:53,226 --> 00:01:54,849
but I want one heck of a band.

61
00:01:55,005 --> 00:01:55,915
I've been eating right.

62
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,148
I've been exercising.

63
00:01:57,928 --> 00:01:59,478
And I want to boogie with
Carole at this wedding.

64
00:02:00,705 --> 00:02:01,671
And I will boogie.

65
00:02:01,672 --> 00:02:03,284
All right. It's already
taken care of, Dad.

66
00:02:03,285 --> 00:02:05,691
I'm going to hire the New
Directions as your band.

67
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,345
Right? It won't cost you a cent.

68
00:02:07,346 --> 00:02:08,664
They're cheap, they're available.

69
00:02:09,176 --> 00:02:10,424
Long story short...

70
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,488
you're having a Glee wedding.

71
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:18,787
Today is a red-letter day.

72
00:02:19,093 --> 00:02:22,621
The big day has finally
arrived for one Sue Sylvester.

73
00:02:22,622 --> 00:02:24,107
Becky, get in here!

74
00:02:24,108 --> 00:02:27,715
Get these invites down
to the post office, stat.

75
00:02:27,923 --> 00:02:29,108
Got it, Coach.

76
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:34,407
And to think that this joyous
occasion began in horror.

77
00:02:34,408 --> 00:02:38,361
which is why I just prefer to
think of the homeless as outdoorsy.

78
00:02:38,362 --> 00:02:40,230
So shine on, urban campers!

79
00:02:40,231 --> 00:02:42,002
You smell like adventure!

80
00:02:42,003 --> 00:02:44,720
And that's how Sue sees it.

81
00:02:44,721 --> 00:02:47,236
Sue, you're the bee's knees.

82
00:02:47,237 --> 00:02:48,182
Before we break,

83
00:02:48,183 --> 00:02:49,697
I'd like to make an announcement.

84
00:02:49,698 --> 00:02:51,626
Rod and I are engaged.

85
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:54,835
I popped the question
in my building's

86
00:02:54,836 --> 00:02:57,493
common-use hot tub. Booyah.

87
00:02:57,494 --> 00:02:58,639
Not to worry, ladies.

88
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,118
It's an open marriage.

89
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:01,305
We'll be right back.

90
00:03:01,377 --> 00:03:03,883
How dare you humiliate
me like that!

91
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:05,394
People know you and I dated.

92
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:08,531
Sue, you can't tame the tiger.

93
00:03:08,532 --> 00:03:10,260
You've read my tattoos.

94
00:03:10,261 --> 00:03:11,157
Face it, Sue.

95
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:12,637
You're never going
to find someone,

96
00:03:12,638 --> 00:03:14,433
and you're going to die alone.

97
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,927
So I decided to try online dating.

98
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:24,244
And there was only one
match for Sue Sylvester.

99
00:03:26,292 --> 00:03:28,722
One Sue Sylvester.

100
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:32,116
So thanks, eDesperate.

101
00:03:32,117 --> 00:03:33,873
I'm over the moon.

102
00:03:33,874 --> 00:03:36,220
Or maybe I'm a little
high off this adhesive,

103
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:38,951
but I want to scream from
the highest mountain,

104
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:42,440
"Sue Sylvester is
marrying herself."

105
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:48,551
Hey, is that safe?

106
00:03:48,552 --> 00:03:50,080
With your shoulder
messed up and all?

107
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:51,992
Doesn't feel messed up to me.
Now that I'm healthy,

108
00:03:51,993 --> 00:03:53,474
I'm going to be gunning
to get my job back.

109
00:03:53,698 --> 00:03:56,700
Well, Coach Beiste isn't going to
replace me while we're winning.

110
00:03:56,701 --> 00:03:58,066
You can't win every game.

111
00:03:58,067 --> 00:03:59,939
Look, I still want to
be friends. It's just,

112
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,903
I'm kind of on the cusp of being one
of the most popular guys in school.

113
00:04:03,796 --> 00:04:05,065
Wow. I, uh...

114
00:04:05,206 --> 00:04:07,403
I didn't think you were the type
that cared about that stuff.

115
00:04:07,404 --> 00:04:09,311
Everyone does. Being on top

116
00:04:09,312 --> 00:04:10,764
means you don't have to
take crap from anybody.

117
00:04:10,765 --> 00:04:13,100
No teasing, no Slushee facials.

118
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,668
Being quarterback isn't
going to put you on top,

119
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:19,617
especially since you can't even
get Quinn to be your girlfriend.

120
00:04:19,618 --> 00:04:20,812
I'm working on that, too.

121
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,415
So, what do you want to
talk about in private?

122
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:35,880
These galactic mobiles
aren't the stars of McKinley.

123
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,504
We are.

124
00:04:37,868 --> 00:04:39,383
Or at least, I want us to be.

125
00:04:39,384 --> 00:04:40,445
Okay.

126
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:43,311
I think I love you.

127
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:49,424
Look, my shoulder's healed, I'm going
to be the quarterback again soon.

128
00:04:49,572 --> 00:04:51,253
And you're already
the head cheerleader.

129
00:04:53,299 --> 00:04:55,163
Oh, my God, are you proposing?

130
00:04:55,285 --> 00:04:57,470
We've known each other
for six weeks. Stand up.

131
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,453
- You're freaking me out.
- I want to marry you...

132
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,977
some day. Until then,

133
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:03,801
will you accept this promise ring?

134
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,570
What are you, six?

135
00:05:06,571 --> 00:05:08,043
If you accept,

136
00:05:08,983 --> 00:05:12,399
this ring will symbolize my
promise to you to be true,

137
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,759
to never pressure you to
do anything more than kiss,

138
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,855
to listen to your problems,

139
00:05:16,856 --> 00:05:19,412
to tell you when you
have food in your teeth

140
00:05:19,413 --> 00:05:21,715
or eye gunk, to come over to
your house whenever you need

141
00:05:21,716 --> 00:05:23,284
something super
heavy moved around.

142
00:05:23,742 --> 00:05:27,203
I promise to make you feel proud

143
00:05:27,204 --> 00:05:29,817
when you point down
the hall and say,

144
00:05:29,818 --> 00:05:31,531
"That dude's my boyfriend."

145
00:05:31,713 --> 00:05:34,265
And I promise to do
all of those things

146
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:36,593
without ever trying to sound
like Matthew McConaughey.

147
00:05:41,973 --> 00:05:43,702
I really care about you, Quinn.

148
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,810
And I want us to be together.

149
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,915
Is that a no?

150
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,257
It's a maybe.

151
00:06:09,558 --> 00:06:12,057
Hey, uh, so I've been
reviewing this itinerary,

152
00:06:12,058 --> 00:06:13,497
and I don't really get it.

153
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,040
Are you sure we should release
300 live doves indoors?

154
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,778
Won't that get kind of messy?

155
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:19,681
That's why we feed
them glitter, Finn.

156
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,457
Oh. Well, look,
I've been thinking about it.

157
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,780
I really want to do something
special for the wedding, and

158
00:06:25,781 --> 00:06:27,022
I wanted to take this opportunity

159
00:06:27,023 --> 00:06:31,780
to sort of remind everyone that I'm,
you know, a leader.

160
00:06:32,132 --> 00:06:33,547
I have the perfect idea.

161
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:35,255
After you walk your
mom down the aisle,

162
00:06:35,256 --> 00:06:36,567
and give her away to my dad...

163
00:06:36,568 --> 00:06:37,242
Incredibly creepy.

164
00:06:37,243 --> 00:06:38,733
and give your speech
to the newlyweds...

165
00:06:38,734 --> 00:06:40,294
which I will write,
although you are free

166
00:06:40,295 --> 00:06:41,642
to suggest overall themes...

167
00:06:41,643 --> 00:06:43,208
you and Carole will have a lovely

168
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:44,696
mother-and-son dance
in front of everyone.

169
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:45,992
Ah, that's a terrible idea.

170
00:06:45,993 --> 00:06:47,645
Everybody knows I'm
the worst dancer.

171
00:06:47,646 --> 00:06:48,725
Finn, trust me on this.

172
00:06:48,726 --> 00:06:50,677
I've been planning
weddings since I was two.

173
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:52,435
My Power Rangers got
married and divorced

174
00:06:52,436 --> 00:06:54,277
in so many combinations,
they were like Fleetwood Mac.

175
00:06:54,278 --> 00:06:55,731
I guess if I could pull it off,

176
00:06:56,574 --> 00:06:58,698
it would make me seem
like a cool stud.

177
00:06:58,699 --> 00:06:59,836
Totally.

178
00:06:59,912 --> 00:07:01,780
Thanks. It's a plan.

179
00:07:11,201 --> 00:07:12,671
I don't want you near me.

180
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:25,790
Can I have this?

181
00:07:28,292 --> 00:07:29,488
Thanks.

182
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:36,351
Are you okay?

183
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:39,739
No. No.

184
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,822
Okay, let's go to the
principal, come on.

185
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,096
Did he physically hurt you?

186
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:47,014
No.

187
00:07:47,015 --> 00:07:48,667
You said he's shoved you
into the lockers before.

188
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,269
Well, I can't expel
a kid for shoving.

189
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,425
He'll just say, "I didn't mean
to shove that kid, I tripped!"

190
00:07:52,426 --> 00:07:53,543
Excuse works like a charm.

191
00:07:53,544 --> 00:07:54,501
I use it all the time.

192
00:07:54,502 --> 00:07:55,953
He didn't shove me this time.

193
00:07:55,954 --> 00:07:58,229
He just... terrified me.

194
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:01,750
Lady, I can't suspend a
student because he scares you.

195
00:08:01,751 --> 00:08:04,690
High school is a dry run
for the rest of your life.

196
00:08:04,691 --> 00:08:07,030
It's rough. People can be mean.

197
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:08,145
That's your advice?

198
00:08:08,372 --> 00:08:09,530
That's all you have to say?

199
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,930
William, I was bullied
my entire life.

200
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,295
I grew up with a
handicapable sister.

201
00:08:14,296 --> 00:08:17,040
I know very well how
cruel people can be.

202
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,689
Was it difficult? Yes.

203
00:08:18,924 --> 00:08:20,329
Did it make me stronger?

204
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:22,011
You bet it did.

205
00:08:22,012 --> 00:08:23,664
It's the fear that's the worst.

206
00:08:24,392 --> 00:08:26,986
I never know when it's coming,
I can't concentrate,

207
00:08:26,987 --> 00:08:28,799
I don't feel like I'm part
of this school at all.

208
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,753
I feel like I'm in a horror
movie where this creature

209
00:08:30,754 --> 00:08:32,181
follows me around terrifying me,

210
00:08:32,182 --> 00:08:34,069
and there's nothing
that I can do about it?

211
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,032
I mean, you...

212
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,505
You don't know what's going
on in this kid's head.

213
00:08:37,506 --> 00:08:38,999
You don't know what
he's capable of.

214
00:08:42,053 --> 00:08:43,057
What does that mean?

215
00:08:43,192 --> 00:08:45,217
Nothing. Maybe I'm overreacting.

216
00:08:45,218 --> 00:08:48,959
Lady, this kid lays a finger on you,
you come straight to me,

217
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,456
and I will expel him faster

218
00:08:50,457 --> 00:08:53,581
than a Thai take-out place can
read back your delivery order.

219
00:08:53,582 --> 00:08:54,735
Okay?

220
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:55,733
But until that happens,

221
00:08:55,734 --> 00:08:58,151
and I'm genuinely
sorry to say this,

222
00:08:58,515 --> 00:09:01,360
there is nothing legally I
or the school board can do.

223
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:03,641
Come on, Kurt.

224
00:09:03,642 --> 00:09:05,046
We're gonna be late for rehearsal.

225
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:12,591
You know, when you call me lady...
That's bullying.

226
00:09:13,195 --> 00:09:14,151
And it's really hurtful.

227
00:09:14,152 --> 00:09:15,985
I'm sorry. I thought
that was your name.

228
00:09:15,986 --> 00:09:17,362
As an apology, I'll allow you

229
00:09:17,363 --> 00:09:19,142
to choose from the
following nicknames...

230
00:09:19,143 --> 00:09:22,756
Gelfling, Porcelain,
and Tickle-Me-Doughface.

231
00:09:24,214 --> 00:09:25,330
I guess I'll go with Porcelain.

232
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,835
Damn. Totally wanted
Tickle-Me-Doughface.

233
00:09:29,514 --> 00:09:31,845
Ladies, the Kurt-Karofsky
bullying situation

234
00:09:31,846 --> 00:09:33,171
is getting way out of control.

235
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:34,915
Kurt's miserable,
he's losing weight...

236
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,127
and not in a good way.

237
00:09:36,128 --> 00:09:38,316
And he's barely even fighting
me for solos anymore.

238
00:09:38,317 --> 00:09:39,517
We've all been teased,
but something

239
00:09:39,518 --> 00:09:41,302
about what Karofsky's
doing is so much worse.

240
00:09:41,303 --> 00:09:43,236
We're all lucky enough to have
boyfriends on the football team.

241
00:09:43,237 --> 00:09:46,236
I say, we band together and demand
that they confront Karofsky.

242
00:09:46,237 --> 00:09:47,963
Okay, first off all,
I'm not dating Sam.

243
00:09:47,964 --> 00:09:49,063
And second of all,

244
00:09:49,064 --> 00:09:50,409
I think you personally just set

245
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,013
the feminist movement
back 50 years.

246
00:09:52,014 --> 00:09:54,010
But guys like Karofsky
only respond to muscle.

247
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:56,158
So we're going to fight
violence with violence? No!

248
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:58,563
Look, I'm not saying
that they should hit him.

249
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,458
What I'm saying is that
we need to defend Kurt,

250
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:01,845
and there's strength in numbers.

251
00:10:01,846 --> 00:10:05,005
I'm confused. Are you and
Artie officially dating now?

252
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:06,119
Deal with it.

253
00:10:07,462 --> 00:10:09,512
When you guys fooled around,
did he ever, like,

254
00:10:09,513 --> 00:10:10,608
just lie there?

255
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,196
Why didn't you tell
me that we were having

256
00:10:12,197 --> 00:10:13,250
a Glee girls meeting?

257
00:10:13,251 --> 00:10:14,966
This is a meeting for Glee
girls with boyfriends.

258
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:17,483
We're going to make them stop
Karofsky from bullying Kurt.

259
00:10:17,593 --> 00:10:20,264
Okay, I'm dating Puckerman.
You're getting naked with Puckerman.

260
00:10:20,265 --> 00:10:22,873
Besides, Puck can't mess with Karofsky;
He's on probation.

261
00:10:22,874 --> 00:10:24,919
If he gets in a fight with him,
he'll be sent back to juvee.

262
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,224
Mm-hmm. Yeah,
so now if you'll excuse us.

263
00:10:28,487 --> 00:10:30,416
You're so on my list, dwarf.

264
00:10:31,606 --> 00:10:33,972
Look, if something
bad happens to Kurt,

265
00:10:33,973 --> 00:10:36,035
and we didn't do
anything to stop it,

266
00:10:36,281 --> 00:10:38,203
we'll never be able to
live with ourselves.

267
00:10:39,441 --> 00:10:40,621
I'm a little confused.

268
00:10:40,622 --> 00:10:43,353
I said not only am
I marrying myself,

269
00:10:43,354 --> 00:10:45,124
I will be officiating
the ceremony.

270
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,090
I'm not, um...

271
00:10:46,091 --> 00:10:47,871
Marsha Dean, when I hired you

272
00:10:47,872 --> 00:10:50,102
and your crack team at
Marsha Dean Weddings,

273
00:10:50,103 --> 00:10:52,928
I did so because you
specialize in unique weddings.

274
00:10:52,929 --> 00:10:56,372
Well, that mostly means that
some of them take place outside.

275
00:10:56,373 --> 00:10:57,789
Marsha Dean, you are fired.

276
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,972
You are out of your depth.

277
00:10:58,973 --> 00:11:01,449
And nothing is too
good for Sue Sylvester.

278
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,354
Well, that's one
way to look at it.

279
00:11:03,524 --> 00:11:04,672
Hello.

280
00:11:05,306 --> 00:11:06,905
I'm Doris Sylvester.

281
00:11:06,906 --> 00:11:08,246
I'm this one's mother.

282
00:11:08,247 --> 00:11:11,400
Marsha, I'll bet people
say you look mannish.

283
00:11:11,401 --> 00:11:12,612
But you know something?

284
00:11:12,613 --> 00:11:16,075
I think it's perfectly all right
for a woman to be handsome.

285
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,344
Takes all kinds.

286
00:11:20,868 --> 00:11:24,371
Susie, come give
your mother a hug.

287
00:11:25,364 --> 00:11:26,728
Please don't call me that.

288
00:11:26,865 --> 00:11:28,185
Come on, come on.

289
00:11:32,061 --> 00:11:34,276
Oh, you poked me in my sternum.

290
00:11:34,674 --> 00:11:37,565
I always forget that
you have this ribcage

291
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:38,893
that's kind of weird...

292
00:11:38,894 --> 00:11:41,382
and adorable.
I think I'll sit down.

293
00:11:42,647 --> 00:11:44,571
Mom, what are you doing here?

294
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:48,328
Good news, Suze.
We finally caught the last Nazi.

295
00:11:48,329 --> 00:11:50,719
For two and a half years,
we've been hot

296
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,603
on the trail of Eva
Braun's great-nephew Chad.

297
00:11:54,604 --> 00:11:57,293
And you know what? He's been
under our noses this whole time.

298
00:11:57,294 --> 00:11:59,420
Working in Phoenix as a CPA.

299
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:03,589
I felt bad taking him out.

300
00:12:03,817 --> 00:12:06,155
I mean, it's punishment
enough to live there.

301
00:12:06,403 --> 00:12:08,433
You ever been to Phoenix?
It's a hellhole.

302
00:12:08,434 --> 00:12:09,670
Mom, where have you been?

303
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:11,468
I haven't seen you
or heard from you

304
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:12,658
- in over three years.
- What do you mean?

305
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:14,956
I-I wrote you all those postcards.

306
00:12:14,957 --> 00:12:17,270
I mean, granted, they were decoys.

307
00:12:17,271 --> 00:12:18,788
Have you been to see Jean yet?

308
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:20,361
It's the top of my list.

309
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:22,784
Look, I, uh...

310
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:25,391
I know it's been a
long time, but...

311
00:12:25,994 --> 00:12:28,216
the work I was doing
was important.

312
00:12:28,426 --> 00:12:30,299
And I always wanted
to get back here

313
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,326
and be a mother to
you girls again.

314
00:12:34,025 --> 00:12:35,725
And Susie, I have to ask you,

315
00:12:35,726 --> 00:12:38,366
what is it with this
ridiculous wedding?

316
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:39,518
Have you given up on love?

317
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,983
No, Mother. Quite the opposite.

318
00:12:40,984 --> 00:12:42,164
I mean, when you were little,

319
00:12:42,165 --> 00:12:44,979
the other mothers used to tell
me that you'd never find anybody,

320
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,706
but I said, "No, no, no, no.

321
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:50,120
"She's a perfectly okay child.

322
00:12:50,121 --> 00:12:51,923
She'll grow into her looks."

323
00:12:52,195 --> 00:12:53,143
And you know what?

324
00:12:55,117 --> 00:12:56,520
I believe you still might.

325
00:12:56,521 --> 00:12:58,296
Mother, I am going through
with this wedding.

326
00:12:58,297 --> 00:13:00,522
And you are free to accept
the invitation or not.

327
00:13:00,523 --> 00:13:02,571
- Are you inviting me?
- I'm inviting you now.

328
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:04,912
Well, I am accepting.
Don't get so huffy.

329
00:13:06,472 --> 00:13:09,796
Since your father's no
longer with us, I want to

330
00:13:09,797 --> 00:13:11,737
- walk you down the aisle.
- No. I'm doing that.

331
00:13:11,738 --> 00:13:14,037
Then I know exactly
what I'm going to do.

332
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:17,795
You remember when you
were a little girl,

333
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,794
and you used to ask
me to sing to you?

334
00:13:19,795 --> 00:13:21,295
And I never had the time.

335
00:13:21,296 --> 00:13:23,704
So you'd line up
your little dollies

336
00:13:23,705 --> 00:13:25,334
and they'd sing to each other?

337
00:13:25,335 --> 00:13:27,290
Appalachian murder ballads,

338
00:13:27,755 --> 00:13:29,531
but it was touching.

339
00:13:30,714 --> 00:13:32,072
You know something, though?

340
00:13:32,944 --> 00:13:35,254
I'm going to be there
for you this time.

341
00:13:36,342 --> 00:13:38,434
I'm going to sing at your wedding.

342
00:13:39,408 --> 00:13:41,520
But why? Karofsky
plays right guard.

343
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,419
If he gets pissed at me, I'm
going to get sacked more times

344
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,058
than Jay Cutler,
which means we're going to lose,

345
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,811
which means Beiste is going
to make Sam quarterback.

346
00:13:47,812 --> 00:13:49,228
Is being quarterback
more important to you

347
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,796
than helping out the kid who's
going to be your stepbrother?

348
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,933
Look, we both know I can help
him more if I stay on top.

349
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:55,275
Look, Kurt's going to be fine.

350
00:13:55,787 --> 00:13:58,171
Rachel, I'm sorry.

351
00:13:58,457 --> 00:13:59,775
I want to, but I can't.

352
00:14:00,582 --> 00:14:03,264
I've never been so
disappointed in you before.

353
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,344
But...

354
00:14:10,025 --> 00:14:11,303
Stop picking on Kurt.

355
00:14:11,304 --> 00:14:12,622
You mind? I'm changing.

356
00:14:12,623 --> 00:14:13,758
We're serious.

357
00:14:15,177 --> 00:14:16,661
This is a warning. Oh, yeah?

358
00:14:16,662 --> 00:14:18,108
From now on, you're
gonna leave him alone.

359
00:14:18,448 --> 00:14:21,098
Look, if he wants to be a homo,

360
00:14:21,656 --> 00:14:24,179
that's up to him,
but don't rub it in my face.

361
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,591
We're not asking you.

362
00:14:25,592 --> 00:14:27,433
Yeah, we're done
talking about this.

363
00:14:28,271 --> 00:14:29,337
Just back off, all right?

364
00:14:29,338 --> 00:14:30,998
Look, you back off. Hey!

365
00:14:32,248 --> 00:14:33,262
Artie, are you okay?

366
00:14:40,677 --> 00:14:41,933
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?!

367
00:14:41,934 --> 00:14:44,683
Get up! Get up here! Get up!

368
00:14:46,266 --> 00:14:48,260
What the hell's going on here?

369
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,983
Dude was a wild animal.

370
00:14:53,984 --> 00:14:56,149
Manimal. I'm so turned
on by you right now.

371
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,773
How bad does it look?
It's pretty hot, actually.

372
00:14:58,774 --> 00:14:59,567
You have no idea how hard

373
00:14:59,568 --> 00:15:01,206
it was for me not to
jump into that beatdown.

374
00:15:01,207 --> 00:15:02,108
Where were you, Finn?

375
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,524
I was still out on
the field, okay?

376
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:04,668
I totally would have given

377
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:05,846
him a beatdown if I had
been there, though.

378
00:15:05,847 --> 00:15:08,082
The fact is, it shouldn't have
gone down without you, Finn.

379
00:15:08,395 --> 00:15:09,950
You should have been
leading the charge.

380
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,488
Lay off Finn, everyone.
It isn't his problem.

381
00:15:12,816 --> 00:15:14,432
It's none of your problems,
actually.

382
00:15:15,106 --> 00:15:18,082
But thank you for what you did,
especially Sam.

383
00:15:18,162 --> 00:15:20,391
Serious, an epitome of a leader.

384
00:15:20,532 --> 00:15:21,542
What's going on?

385
00:15:21,884 --> 00:15:22,925
What happened to Sam's eye?

386
00:15:22,926 --> 00:15:24,317
He stood up to Karofsky.

387
00:15:24,318 --> 00:15:27,127
All the guys did. Well, not Finn.

388
00:15:27,128 --> 00:15:28,057
Is everyone okay?

389
00:15:28,058 --> 00:15:30,542
- Do we all need to go talk to Principal Sylvester?
- No.

390
00:15:30,543 --> 00:15:33,459
I got in a few good licks, too,
so we can just call it even.

391
00:15:34,172 --> 00:15:35,860
And maybe this will send
a warning to Karofsky,

392
00:15:35,861 --> 00:15:37,109
telling him to back off Kurt.

393
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,138
You okay, Kurt?

394
00:15:41,624 --> 00:15:43,628
All right, guys.
Let's take our places.

395
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:45,262
We got a wedding to prepare for.

396
00:15:49,572 --> 00:15:50,850
Well, Mr. Piano Man,

397
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:52,341
I think I owe you an apology.

398
00:15:52,566 --> 00:15:54,397
Not to worry, Susie-Q.

399
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:57,067
I arranged for us to
spend an hour in here

400
00:15:57,068 --> 00:15:59,961
with that, uh, that cutie-pie,
what's his, uh...

401
00:15:59,962 --> 00:16:01,304
handsome guy, what's his name?

402
00:16:01,352 --> 00:16:02,614
Will Schuster?

403
00:16:03,144 --> 00:16:04,337
Let's get this over with.

404
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,174
Look...

405
00:16:05,804 --> 00:16:09,053
I know you've always
resented my leaving.

406
00:16:09,522 --> 00:16:12,739
But I don't think you
ever truly appreciated

407
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:16,443
the sacrifices I made to
be a famous Nazi hunter.

408
00:16:16,444 --> 00:16:19,970
I don't think you ever thought
about how hard it was on me.

409
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:24,883
So, this is the song I'm going
to sing at your wedding.

410
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:26,158
Yoo-hoo! There we are.

411
00:16:26,964 --> 00:16:28,857
I know you know it.

412
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,201
It's one of my favorites.

413
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:35,536
Well, hit it!

414
00:16:41,786 --> 00:16:47,288
* Why, oh why, oh why, oh *

415
00:16:47,968 --> 00:16:53,256
* Why did I ever leave Ohio? *

416
00:16:54,093 --> 00:16:56,898
* Why did I wander *

417
00:16:57,104 --> 00:17:00,021
* To find what lies yonder *

418
00:17:00,022 --> 00:17:06,445
* When life was so cozy at home? *

419
00:17:06,446 --> 00:17:12,225
* Wondr'ing while I wander*

420
00:17:12,886 --> 00:17:15,943
* Why did I fly? *

421
00:17:15,944 --> 00:17:18,776
* Why did I roam? *

422
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,977
* Oh why, oh why, oh *

423
00:17:21,978 --> 00:17:25,001
* Did I leave Ohio? *

424
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:29,158
* Maybe I'd better go... *

425
00:17:29,362 --> 00:17:33,632
* O-H-I-O * * Oh... *

426
00:17:33,633 --> 00:17:36,633
* Maybe I'd better go home. *

427
00:17:45,795 --> 00:17:47,482
Mother, this song
still doesn't explain

428
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,390
why you abandoned your children.

429
00:17:49,391 --> 00:17:51,857
Ohio was stifling,
and we couldn't wait

430
00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:53,774
to get out of the place.
And I told you,

431
00:17:53,775 --> 00:17:56,203
"Sue, we're going to
be hunting Nazis."

432
00:17:56,204 --> 00:17:58,520
And Pop said, "Sue,
this might take a little while."

433
00:17:58,521 --> 00:18:00,171
Well, those Nazis are slippery,

434
00:18:00,172 --> 00:18:02,613
and me hunting them way
down in Lima, Peru...

435
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,969
We'd get postcards
from Niagara Falls...

436
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,553
While I'm stalking Mengele
in Bolivian malls.

437
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:10,633
Three times a year,
we'd get crackling phone calls.

438
00:18:10,634 --> 00:18:12,429
Happy birthday! Hunting Nazis!

439
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,357
Merry Christmas! Hunting Nazis!

440
00:18:14,358 --> 00:18:15,903
Homesick. Abandoned.

441
00:18:15,904 --> 00:18:17,705
Heartsick. Neglected.

442
00:18:17,706 --> 00:18:22,659
* Thank heavens we're free! *

443
00:18:24,454 --> 00:18:30,028
* Why, oh why, oh why, oh *

444
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:36,222
* Why did I ever leave Ohio? *

445
00:18:43,132 --> 00:18:45,943
* Oh why, oh why, oh *

446
00:18:45,944 --> 00:18:50,103
* Did I leave Ohio? *

447
00:18:50,104 --> 00:18:53,301
* Maybe I'd better *

448
00:18:53,302 --> 00:18:55,902
* Stay home... *

449
00:19:11,346 --> 00:19:13,732
Well, that wasn't as good
as I thought it would be.

450
00:19:13,733 --> 00:19:15,566
Whoops! Wait a minute.

451
00:19:15,664 --> 00:19:17,458
I've got a fitting
for your wedding.

452
00:19:18,604 --> 00:19:21,178
I'm wearing white.
I know you won't mind.

453
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:23,029
It goes with my skin tone.

454
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,856
You? You got your
father's coloring.

455
00:19:26,378 --> 00:19:27,483
Give us a kiss.

456
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:35,560
* Maybe I'd better stay home. *

457
00:19:37,078 --> 00:19:38,142
Thank you both for attending

458
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:39,628
the Kurt Hummel
Wedding Dance Seminar.

459
00:19:40,005 --> 00:19:41,506
Dad, you're going
to have to pull off

460
00:19:41,507 --> 00:19:43,320
the first dance with Carole.
And if Uncle Andy's

461
00:19:43,321 --> 00:19:45,401
40th birthday party
was any indication,

462
00:19:45,402 --> 00:19:46,683
you're going to need some work.

463
00:19:46,684 --> 00:19:48,448
What are you talking about?
My moves were great, okay?

464
00:19:48,449 --> 00:19:50,484
It was the...
damn sangria... Okay.

465
00:19:50,485 --> 00:19:52,706
- We dance to the beat, not to the words.
- Affected my coordination.

466
00:19:52,707 --> 00:19:55,003
- I'm here, right?
- Yes, right here. Okay.

467
00:19:55,099 --> 00:19:57,296
All right, have you guys chosen a...
No... A wedding song?

468
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:59,883
Uh, yes. We're thinking
"Stairway" or some Bubl?

469
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:00,726
Okay. Great.

470
00:20:00,727 --> 00:20:02,958
So it's basically
one-two-three-four. Okay.

471
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:05,329
Follow me, all right?
Gentleman leads on the left.

472
00:20:05,397 --> 00:20:06,431
Right. Opposite of me. Okay?

473
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:07,665
Get ready? Opposite.

474
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:10,095
One-two-three-four.

475
00:20:10,096 --> 00:20:11,061
Okay, getting back.

476
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:12,596
Hey, look at me, I'm dancing, huh?

477
00:20:12,664 --> 00:20:14,031
Look at that! Yeah, okay.

478
00:20:14,098 --> 00:20:15,766
Come over here, and dance
with yourself, practice.

479
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,467
Come on, Finn, no chickening out.

480
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,136
I did it. You got to do it, too.

481
00:20:19,203 --> 00:20:21,038
Okay, uh...

482
00:20:22,974 --> 00:20:24,408
My feet are moving
and there's music.

483
00:20:24,475 --> 00:20:25,776
All right. Okay. Position.

484
00:20:25,843 --> 00:20:27,244
That's dancing. Uh...

485
00:20:27,312 --> 00:20:28,946
Can we... Can we shut the door?
I'm not really comfortable

486
00:20:29,013 --> 00:20:30,830
with people watching.
What are you talking about?

487
00:20:30,831 --> 00:20:32,534
You danced in front of
1,000 people at Regionals.

488
00:20:34,986 --> 00:20:36,820
Okay.

489
00:20:41,025 --> 00:20:43,727
What the hell was that?

490
00:20:43,795 --> 00:20:45,696
It's nothing, Dad.
That was not nothing.

491
00:20:45,763 --> 00:20:47,597
That guy was making fun of you.
What the hell's his name?

492
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:49,132
Tell him, Kurt.

493
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,834
Tell me what? Tell him, or I will.

494
00:20:50,902 --> 00:20:53,270
His name's Dave Karofsky.

495
00:20:53,338 --> 00:20:55,939
He's... been harassing
me for a few weeks now.

496
00:20:56,007 --> 00:20:57,274
Harassing you how?

497
00:20:57,342 --> 00:21:00,344
Just... Shoving me,
and giving me a hard time.

498
00:21:00,411 --> 00:21:01,945
There's more.

499
00:21:02,013 --> 00:21:03,313
There's something else
you're not telling me.

500
00:21:03,381 --> 00:21:04,581
He threatened to kill me.

501
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,718
What? You've got to be kidding me.

502
00:21:07,785 --> 00:21:09,987
Burt!

503
00:21:10,054 --> 00:21:12,155
What the hell?
You like picking on people?

504
00:21:12,223 --> 00:21:14,024
What?! Why don't you try me?

505
00:21:14,092 --> 00:21:15,025
Burt! Stop!

506
00:21:15,093 --> 00:21:17,094
Please, you're sick. Come on.

507
00:21:23,352 --> 00:21:24,717
What the hell have you been doing

508
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:26,378
while this is all going on, huh?

509
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:29,288
Dad...

510
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:34,184
So it seems the situation
has reached a boiling point.

511
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:36,153
You're damn right, it has.
Nothing happened.

512
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,355
I'll tell you what really happened.
Mr. Karofsky...

513
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:39,689
My name's Paul.

514
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,963
Paul, your kid threatened
the life of my son.

515
00:21:43,227 --> 00:21:45,376
Porcelain? Is that true?

516
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:47,364
That's not true.
I didn't say anything.

517
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:48,665
That's what he said.

518
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:50,634
He said he would kill
me if I told anyone.

519
00:21:50,701 --> 00:21:52,803
If you told anyone what?

520
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:56,606
Just... that he was picking on me.

521
00:21:56,674 --> 00:21:59,042
He's making all this stuff up.

522
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,410
Oh, is that right? PAUL:
Hold on a sec.

523
00:22:00,478 --> 00:22:03,246
You have been acting
differently lately, David.

524
00:22:03,314 --> 00:22:04,714
You used to get A's and B's.

525
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:07,217
You're talking back,
you're acting out,

526
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:08,952
and now we're sitting here.

527
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:13,762
So let me ask you:
Why would Kurt make that up?

528
00:22:14,826 --> 00:22:16,359
Maybe he likes me.

529
00:22:16,427 --> 00:22:19,930
I think we're wasting
our time here.

530
00:22:19,997 --> 00:22:21,631
It's your job to protect people.

531
00:22:21,699 --> 00:22:23,600
Couldn't agree more.

532
00:22:23,668 --> 00:22:26,808
After hearing both sides of the story,
you are hereby expelled.

533
00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:27,945
I will not have one student

534
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,468
threatening the life of another.

535
00:22:29,469 --> 00:22:30,548
If you don't think this is fair,

536
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,142
well, you can appeal
to the school board.

537
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,910
You'll leave campus immediately.

538
00:22:36,576 --> 00:22:37,872
I appreciate your time.

539
00:22:46,133 --> 00:22:46,685
Thank you.

540
00:22:46,753 --> 00:22:48,123
Enjoy your wedding.

541
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,480
Huh.

542
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,114
Never learned how to tie a tie.

543
00:23:00,371 --> 00:23:01,646
Sit down, Frankenteen.

544
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:05,775
I'm guessing you know
that you're losing it.

545
00:23:05,776 --> 00:23:08,784
I mean, Sam is clearly
the new Glee favorite,

546
00:23:08,785 --> 00:23:10,444
he's going to become
starting quarterback...

547
00:23:10,445 --> 00:23:12,255
What's your point? My point

548
00:23:12,256 --> 00:23:14,474
is that you need a
coolness injection.

549
00:23:14,668 --> 00:23:15,668
If you were honest and told people

550
00:23:15,736 --> 00:23:17,069
that we did it last year,

551
00:23:17,137 --> 00:23:19,212
you would go from uncool to
Chilly Willy in a heartbeat.

552
00:23:19,213 --> 00:23:21,184
Maybe, but I can't do that.

553
00:23:22,206 --> 00:23:23,306
Wait.

554
00:23:23,374 --> 00:23:24,278
What?

555
00:23:26,444 --> 00:23:28,378
There's something I
have to tell you.

556
00:23:28,446 --> 00:23:30,113
I didn't have sex with Jessie.

557
00:23:33,818 --> 00:23:37,654
I-I lied... to make you jealous.

558
00:23:37,722 --> 00:23:38,755
I-It's cool.

559
00:23:38,823 --> 00:23:40,157
Um, you know, I had a feeling,

560
00:23:40,224 --> 00:23:42,125
considering how much of a
prude you are with me...

561
00:23:42,193 --> 00:23:44,027
not that I'm complaining.
This is so much better

562
00:23:44,095 --> 00:23:47,464
because now neither of us have
done it and we can save it

563
00:23:47,532 --> 00:23:49,499
for each other.

564
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:50,641
Awesome.

565
00:23:51,356 --> 00:23:53,193
If she found out,
she'd break up with me.

566
00:23:53,194 --> 00:23:54,571
And this would be bad because...?

567
00:23:54,572 --> 00:23:55,440
Because I'm in love with her

568
00:23:55,441 --> 00:23:56,546
and I don't want to
hurt her feelings.

569
00:23:56,547 --> 00:23:58,708
Okay, don't you see
that that midget is

570
00:23:58,776 --> 00:23:59,976
like an anchor dragging you

571
00:24:00,044 --> 00:24:01,912
down to the depths of Loserville?

572
00:24:01,979 --> 00:24:03,914
Oh, stop it, Santana,
that's my girlfriend.

573
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:04,848
I think you should leave.

574
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:05,941
All right.

575
00:24:05,942 --> 00:24:08,218
Well, maybe I'll tell her.

576
00:24:08,286 --> 00:24:09,352
I mean, if you two broke up,

577
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,587
we'd be free to see
each other, right?

578
00:24:10,655 --> 00:24:11,521
Hey.

579
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:13,356
What are you guys doing?

580
00:24:13,424 --> 00:24:14,459
Nothing.

581
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,393
I was just leaving.

582
00:24:20,164 --> 00:24:22,132
Aren't you going to tell
me how pretty I look?

583
00:24:24,902 --> 00:24:26,836
You look amazing.

584
00:24:26,904 --> 00:24:29,573
What?

585
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,575
I...

586
00:24:31,642 --> 00:24:34,211
I just really love you.

587
00:24:34,278 --> 00:24:35,912
I love you, too.

588
00:24:49,193 --> 00:24:51,361
* lt's a beautiful night *

589
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:55,098
* We're looking for
something dumb to do *

590
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:57,100
* Hey, baby *

591
00:24:57,168 --> 00:25:01,338
* I think I wanna marry you *

592
00:25:01,405 --> 00:25:02,416
* ls it the look in your eyes *

593
00:25:04,373 --> 00:25:05,062
Or is it?

594
00:25:05,063 --> 00:25:07,677
* This dancing juice? *

595
00:25:07,745 --> 00:25:10,647
* Who cares, baby? *

596
00:25:10,715 --> 00:25:13,416
* I think I wanna marry you *

597
00:25:13,484 --> 00:25:15,752
* Well, I know *

598
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:20,590
* This little chapel on
the boulevard we can go *

599
00:25:20,658 --> 00:25:24,227
* No one will know *

600
00:25:24,295 --> 00:25:27,864
* Come on, girl *

601
00:25:27,932 --> 00:25:29,733
* Who cares if we're trashed? *

602
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,468
* Got a pocket full of cash *

603
00:25:31,535 --> 00:25:33,603
* We can blow *

604
00:25:37,608 --> 00:25:40,310
* And it's on, girl *

605
00:25:40,378 --> 00:25:41,828
* Don't say no, no, no, no, no *

606
00:25:41,829 --> 00:25:43,980
* Just say yeah, yeah *

607
00:25:45,316 --> 00:25:46,883
*Yeah, yeah, yeah *

608
00:25:46,951 --> 00:25:49,626
* And we'll go, go, go, go, go *

609
00:25:49,726 --> 00:25:53,695
* If you're ready like I'm ready *

610
00:25:53,696 --> 00:25:56,012
* 'Cause it's a beautiful night *

611
00:25:56,013 --> 00:26:00,030
* We're looking for
something dumb to do *

612
00:26:00,097 --> 00:26:01,983
* Hey, baby *

613
00:26:01,984 --> 00:26:05,001
* I think I wanna marry you *

614
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:09,136
* ls it the look in your eyes *

615
00:26:09,137 --> 00:26:12,328
?Or is it this dancing juice?

616
00:26:12,994 --> 00:26:14,716
* Who cares, baby? *

617
00:26:14,938 --> 00:26:17,530
* I think I wanna marry you! *

618
00:26:17,531 --> 00:26:18,625
* Ba, ba, ba, ba... *

619
00:26:18,693 --> 00:26:21,862
* Just say "I do" *

620
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:24,431
* Oo-oo-ooh... *

621
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,666
* Ba, ba, ba, ba... *

622
00:26:25,733 --> 00:26:28,468
* Tell me right now, baby *

623
00:26:28,536 --> 00:26:32,439
* Tell me right now, baby, baby *

624
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,541
* 'Cause it's a beautiful night *

625
00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:38,445
* We're looking for
something dumb to do *

626
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,447
* Hey, baby *

627
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:43,050
* I think I wanna marry you *

628
00:26:43,117 --> 00:26:44,318
* Ba, ba, ba, ba... *

629
00:26:44,385 --> 00:26:45,619
* Just say "I do" *

630
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,754
* ls it the look in your eyes *

631
00:26:47,822 --> 00:26:51,159
?Or is it this dancing juice?

632
00:26:51,941 --> 00:26:53,842
* Who cares, baby? *

633
00:26:53,843 --> 00:26:56,415
* I think I wanna marry you. *

634
00:27:04,111 --> 00:27:05,278
Please be seated.

635
00:27:06,447 --> 00:27:08,014
We usually start with a prayer.

636
00:27:08,082 --> 00:27:10,278
But a certain young
wedding planner,

637
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:12,085
who shall remain nameless,

638
00:27:12,152 --> 00:27:14,786
was afraid that some in
attendance might fall asleep.

639
00:27:14,787 --> 00:27:17,536
So instead, I'm going
to let Burt and Carole

640
00:27:17,537 --> 00:27:21,087
tell you in their own words why
they've invited you here today.

641
00:27:22,463 --> 00:27:25,665
I'm not really known for
having a way with words.

642
00:27:25,733 --> 00:27:28,234
Uh... you know when you're a kid,

643
00:27:28,302 --> 00:27:32,071
adults will tell you
a lot of things.

644
00:27:32,139 --> 00:27:36,576
But one thing they neglect
to mention is how...

645
00:27:36,644 --> 00:27:38,609
sad life can be.

646
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,788
I lost somebody I loved very much.

647
00:27:42,097 --> 00:27:43,302
But Kurt...

648
00:27:44,656 --> 00:27:46,122
he lost his mom.

649
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,754
And that killed me.

650
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:51,591
Well, we got by, but looking back?

651
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:54,961
I-I want to apologize
to you, Kurt.

652
00:27:55,029 --> 00:27:59,032
What we were living just...
wasn't living.

653
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:01,301
You know that saying,
that when God

654
00:28:01,368 --> 00:28:04,304
closes a door, he opens a window?

655
00:28:04,371 --> 00:28:08,775
Well, sometimes out of nowhere,
he'll do you one better,

656
00:28:08,842 --> 00:28:10,743
and he'll kick a whole wall down.

657
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:15,415
He grabbed me by the shoulders,
and he pointed me

658
00:28:15,482 --> 00:28:17,951
towards this woman right here.

659
00:28:18,018 --> 00:28:21,621
And he said, "There she is.

660
00:28:21,689 --> 00:28:24,313
Go get her."

661
00:28:24,756 --> 00:28:27,691
You're everything, Carole.

662
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:31,962
Words can't describe you.
You're everything.

663
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:35,414
And I will love you
till the day I die.

664
00:28:36,902 --> 00:28:38,369
Oh, hey...

665
00:28:40,238 --> 00:28:42,273
I'm lucky.

666
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:45,676
Most women, when they get married,
they get one man.

667
00:28:45,744 --> 00:28:47,211
I get two.

668
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,182
One of you saved me
from my wardrobe,

669
00:28:51,249 --> 00:28:53,084
the other one just saved me.

670
00:28:55,854 --> 00:28:59,539
Kurt, you are an amazing person.

671
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:02,827
I'm not only getting a son,
I'm getting a friend.

672
00:29:02,894 --> 00:29:04,161
Finn...

673
00:29:04,229 --> 00:29:06,130
I know you were
resistant at first,

674
00:29:06,198 --> 00:29:08,132
but I am so proud of you.

675
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,601
I've watched you grow into a man.

676
00:29:11,603 --> 00:29:13,304
But I think I'm most proud

677
00:29:13,371 --> 00:29:17,741
that you've become
a brother to Kurt.

678
00:29:19,711 --> 00:29:21,679
We are four people.

679
00:29:21,746 --> 00:29:24,101
Becoming a family.

680
00:29:25,951 --> 00:29:27,251
Okay.

681
00:29:30,989 --> 00:29:32,056
Burt...

682
00:29:32,124 --> 00:29:33,724
Do you take Carole...
? You bet I do!

683
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,328
And do you, Carole,
take this man...?

684
00:29:37,395 --> 00:29:39,971
Oh, yes I do! Yes, I do.

685
00:30:00,411 --> 00:30:03,615
* When marimba rhythms
start to play *

686
00:30:03,616 --> 00:30:07,631
* Dance with me, make me sway *

687
00:30:07,632 --> 00:30:11,379
* Like a lazy ocean
hugs the shore *

688
00:30:11,468 --> 00:30:13,059
* Hold me close *

689
00:30:13,304 --> 00:30:15,022
* Sway me more *

690
00:30:15,416 --> 00:30:19,185
* Other dancers may
be on the floor *

691
00:30:19,253 --> 00:30:22,989
* Dear, but my eyes
will see only you *

692
00:30:23,057 --> 00:30:26,926
* Only you have that
magic technique *

693
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:30,806
* When we sway, I go weak *

694
00:30:30,807 --> 00:30:34,100
* When marimba rhythms
start to play *

695
00:30:34,168 --> 00:30:35,869
* Dance with me *

696
00:30:35,936 --> 00:30:37,971
* Make me sway *

697
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:42,318
* Like a lazy ocean
hugs the shore *

698
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:43,843
* Hold me close *

699
00:30:43,911 --> 00:30:45,945
* Sway me more *

700
00:30:47,581 --> 00:30:51,055
* Like a flower bending
in the breeze *

701
00:30:51,056 --> 00:30:52,809
* Bend with me *

702
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:55,656
* Sway with ease *

703
00:30:55,657 --> 00:30:58,825
* When we dance,
you have a way with me *

704
00:30:58,893 --> 00:31:00,193
* Stay with me *

705
00:31:00,261 --> 00:31:04,097
* Sway with me! *

706
00:31:11,138 --> 00:31:14,274
And now, I'd like to introduce

707
00:31:14,341 --> 00:31:16,966
one of the best men: Finn Hudson!

708
00:31:19,113 --> 00:31:20,313
All right? You did good.

709
00:31:20,381 --> 00:31:22,782
It did the trick.

710
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:25,819
Oh. Thanks.

711
00:31:25,886 --> 00:31:28,054
Hi. Uh, thank you.

712
00:31:28,122 --> 00:31:30,423
Best man.

713
00:31:30,491 --> 00:31:32,659
Right. Uh...

714
00:31:32,726 --> 00:31:34,928
Well, I want to propose
a toast to my mom...

715
00:31:34,995 --> 00:31:38,528
who is so awesome.

716
00:31:40,334 --> 00:31:43,841
I mean... somehow even
without one in the house,

717
00:31:43,842 --> 00:31:46,439
you taught me what
it means to be a man.

718
00:31:47,641 --> 00:31:51,842
In Glee Club, uh,
whenever two of us got together,

719
00:31:51,942 --> 00:31:53,379
we got a nickname.

720
00:31:53,447 --> 00:31:55,248
Rachel and I are Finnchel.

721
00:31:55,316 --> 00:31:57,784
Rachel and Puck were Puckleberry.

722
00:31:57,852 --> 00:32:01,354
And today, a new union was formed.

723
00:32:01,422 --> 00:32:04,791
Furt.

724
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:06,993
You and me, man.

725
00:32:07,061 --> 00:32:09,295
We're brothers from
another mother.

726
00:32:09,363 --> 00:32:12,521
And quite frankly,
no one else has shown me

727
00:32:12,522 --> 00:32:16,594
as much as you about what
it means to be a man.

728
00:32:17,037 --> 00:32:20,940
And over the past few weeks,
uh, some stuff's gone down.

729
00:32:21,008 --> 00:32:24,310
And I haven't manned
up like I should've.

730
00:32:24,378 --> 00:32:30,167
From now on? No matter what
it costs me, I got your back.

731
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:33,052
Okay?

732
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,777
Even if it means getting a Slushee

733
00:32:35,845 --> 00:32:37,634
in the face every now and then.

734
00:32:39,282 --> 00:32:42,985
You put this entire wedding
together by yourself, Kurt.

735
00:32:45,188 --> 00:32:46,989
So as a thank you,
I had the Glee Club

736
00:32:47,056 --> 00:32:48,390
put together a little
number in your honor.

737
00:32:51,127 --> 00:32:53,762
You're going to dance
it with me, dude.

738
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,814
* Oh, her eyes,
her eyes make the stars *

739
00:33:12,882 --> 00:33:14,983
* Look like they're not shinin' *

740
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:16,365
* Her hair, her hair *

741
00:33:16,366 --> 00:33:19,221
* Falls perfectly
without her tryin' *

742
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,923
* She's so beautiful *

743
00:33:21,991 --> 00:33:25,861
* And I tell her every day *

744
00:33:25,928 --> 00:33:27,996
* Oh *

745
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,865
* You know, you know,
you know I'd never *

746
00:33:29,932 --> 00:33:31,667
* Ask you to change *

747
00:33:31,734 --> 00:33:34,436
* If perfect's what
you're searching for *

748
00:33:34,504 --> 00:33:36,505
* Then just stay the same *

749
00:33:36,572 --> 00:33:38,646
* So, don't even bother asking *

750
00:33:38,647 --> 00:33:40,271
* If you look okay *

751
00:33:40,272 --> 00:33:43,278
* You know I'll say *

752
00:33:43,346 --> 00:33:46,014
* When I see your face *

753
00:33:46,082 --> 00:33:48,316
* When I see your face *

754
00:33:48,384 --> 00:33:52,554
* There's not a thing
that I would change *

755
00:33:52,622 --> 00:33:54,723
* 'Cause you're amazing *

756
00:33:54,791 --> 00:33:56,291
* You're amazing *

757
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:59,961
* Just the way you are *

758
00:34:01,964 --> 00:34:04,166
* And when you smile *

759
00:34:04,233 --> 00:34:05,867
* And when you smile *

760
00:34:06,259 --> 00:34:07,758
* The whole world stops *

761
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:10,428
* And stares for a while *

762
00:34:10,495 --> 00:34:12,307
* 'Cause, girl, you're amazing *

763
00:34:12,308 --> 00:34:13,698
* You're amazing *

764
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:17,942
* Just the way you are*

765
00:34:19,137 --> 00:34:22,707
* The way you are... *

766
00:34:22,774 --> 00:34:28,045
* The way you are... *

767
00:34:28,113 --> 00:34:31,248
* Girl, you're amazing *
* You're amazing *

768
00:34:31,316 --> 00:34:34,752
* Just the way you are *

769
00:34:36,955 --> 00:34:41,244
* When I see your face *
* I see your face *

770
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:45,830
* There's not a thing
that I would change *

771
00:34:45,897 --> 00:34:48,933
* 'Cause you're amazing *
* You're amazing *

772
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,535
* Just the way you are *

773
00:34:51,603 --> 00:34:53,838
* Just the way you are *

774
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:56,874
* And when you smile *

775
00:34:56,942 --> 00:34:58,309
* When you smile *

776
00:34:58,377 --> 00:35:03,114
* The whole world stops
and stares for a while *

777
00:35:03,181 --> 00:35:06,250
* 'Cause, girl, you're amazing *
* You're amazing *

778
00:35:06,318 --> 00:35:09,220
* Just the way you are *

779
00:35:09,287 --> 00:35:12,123
* Just the way you are *

780
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:12,957
* Yeah. *

781
00:35:23,438 --> 00:35:25,172
Well, I hope the real wedding

782
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,908
is more exciting
than the rehearsal.

783
00:35:27,976 --> 00:35:29,877
You know what, Jeannie?

784
00:35:29,944 --> 00:35:32,946
There's nothing like
spending time with m'girls.

785
00:35:33,014 --> 00:35:34,464
Then why did you leave us?

786
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,628
I was busy. I was
busy keeping you safe.

787
00:35:37,629 --> 00:35:40,854
Those Nazis, they're nasty people.

788
00:35:40,922 --> 00:35:44,275
You got the illustrated copy of
Mein Kampf I sent you, right?

789
00:35:44,276 --> 00:35:45,189
Yes, I did.

790
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:47,517
Thank you. You're welcome.

791
00:35:49,931 --> 00:35:53,500
Oh, what in the G.D. Hell?

792
00:36:03,442 --> 00:36:04,885
That's enough.

793
00:36:07,115 --> 00:36:09,018
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered today

794
00:36:09,218 --> 00:36:12,853
to join Sue Sylvester and Sue
Sylvester in holy matrimony.

795
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,254
Jeannie, give me the rings.

796
00:36:14,322 --> 00:36:16,523
This is insane.

797
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:20,294
Sue, do you take Sue to be
your lawfully wedded spouse?

798
00:36:22,063 --> 00:36:23,564
I do.

799
00:36:23,942 --> 00:36:26,161
And Sue, do you take Sue

800
00:36:26,162 --> 00:36:28,318
to be your lawfully wedded spouse?

801
00:36:29,915 --> 00:36:31,215
I do.

802
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:36,387
By the power vested
in me by a Web site,

803
00:36:36,454 --> 00:36:39,023
I hereby pronounce
you Sue and Sue.

804
00:36:40,091 --> 00:36:41,625
You may kiss yourself.

805
00:36:42,961 --> 00:36:45,129
I'm sorry.

806
00:36:45,197 --> 00:36:46,830
I'm sorry, but this is crazy.

807
00:36:46,898 --> 00:36:48,132
This whole thing is crazy.

808
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,633
I had my heart

809
00:36:49,701 --> 00:36:52,399
set on singing
during the ceremony!

810
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,909
I don't want to be singing
as you're walking out!

811
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:57,942
I want to have a special
moment with you girls!

812
00:36:58,009 --> 00:37:00,711
We girls have had lots of
special moments, Mother.

813
00:37:00,779 --> 00:37:01,979
You just weren't there.

814
00:37:02,047 --> 00:37:03,516
I resent that.

815
00:37:03,772 --> 00:37:05,251
And I also resent the fact

816
00:37:05,252 --> 00:37:07,374
that you are keeping
me in the background

817
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:09,231
at my own daughter's
wedding, which,

818
00:37:09,232 --> 00:37:12,281
I am sorry to say I
still think is bizarre!

819
00:37:12,282 --> 00:37:15,349
You know when I finally
began to like who I am?

820
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:17,084
When I stopped
trying to please you.

821
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:20,187
So Jean and I had to learn
how to become our own family,

822
00:37:20,255 --> 00:37:23,324
and you can't just waltz
in here after all this time

823
00:37:23,392 --> 00:37:25,860
and start calling the shots.
You're a bully, Mother.

824
00:37:25,928 --> 00:37:27,194
It's taken till now to realize it,

825
00:37:27,262 --> 00:37:29,484
but you are a bully. I am not!

826
00:37:29,485 --> 00:37:32,333
Mother, I cannot remember
a conversation with you

827
00:37:32,401 --> 00:37:35,503
where I didn't walk away
feeling worse about myself.

828
00:37:35,571 --> 00:37:36,624
Well, you know what, Susan?

829
00:37:36,724 --> 00:37:39,040
I'm disappointed in you.

830
00:37:39,107 --> 00:37:39,826
I'm sorry to say, Mother,

831
00:37:39,827 --> 00:37:41,542
you are no longer
invited to my wedding.

832
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,777
What about my song?

833
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:44,879
You are welcome to sing
"The Sound of Silence"

834
00:37:44,947 --> 00:37:46,480
in your hotel room right now.

835
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,117
All right.

836
00:37:55,891 --> 00:37:58,233
And to think I was
going to send you

837
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,188
to Israel for your honeymoon.

838
00:38:00,388 --> 00:38:02,335
They love me there.

839
00:38:04,138 --> 00:38:05,971
You look beautiful.

840
00:38:06,673 --> 00:38:08,241
You're beautiful.

841
00:38:12,433 --> 00:38:13,232
Hi.

842
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,161
Arnica twice a day.

843
00:38:15,261 --> 00:38:16,903
It'll help your bruise.

844
00:38:16,971 --> 00:38:18,805
Thanks.

845
00:38:18,872 --> 00:38:21,941
I've been thinking a lot
about what you did for Kurt.

846
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:23,236
It made a real impact.

847
00:38:23,237 --> 00:38:25,013
I thought the only
impact that was made was

848
00:38:25,014 --> 00:38:27,413
Karofsky's fist impacting my face.

849
00:38:27,481 --> 00:38:29,382
You saw what Finn
did at the wedding.

850
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:31,951
That was because of you.

851
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:32,885
We've been talking
this whole time,

852
00:38:32,886 --> 00:38:35,955
and you haven't even noticed
that I'm wearing your ring.

853
00:38:37,124 --> 00:38:39,225
How'd you get that?

854
00:38:39,293 --> 00:38:41,027
I broke into your locker.

855
00:38:41,095 --> 00:38:43,696
I've always been really
handy with a nail file.

856
00:38:43,764 --> 00:38:45,465
Really? Mm-hmm.

857
00:38:55,943 --> 00:38:57,644
This is absolutely unacceptable.

858
00:38:57,711 --> 00:38:59,646
This psycho threatens
my kid's life,

859
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:02,582
and some school board made up of
a bunch of people I've never met

860
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,584
tells me there's nothing
they can do about it?

861
00:39:04,652 --> 00:39:06,085
Oh, they could do
something about it.

862
00:39:06,153 --> 00:39:07,320
They just decided not to.

863
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:09,689
No one reported witnessing
him being violent,

864
00:39:09,757 --> 00:39:11,424
and there's no way to prove

865
00:39:11,492 --> 00:39:12,992
that he threatened
you with violence.

866
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,661
The school board president
issued a verbal warning

867
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:17,163
to Karofsky,
and that's where we stand.

868
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:19,332
I can't go back to being
terrified all the time.

869
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,434
I jump every time a
locker slams shut.

870
00:39:21,502 --> 00:39:23,036
I flinch whenever
I turn the corner.

871
00:39:23,103 --> 00:39:25,004
I don't feel safe at the school.

872
00:39:25,072 --> 00:39:27,774
Kids who bully, for the most part,

873
00:39:27,841 --> 00:39:29,208
have been bullied themselves.

874
00:39:29,276 --> 00:39:30,576
And I for one don't flatter myself

875
00:39:30,644 --> 00:39:32,745
that that behavior can change.

876
00:39:32,813 --> 00:39:35,048
Now this kid Karofsky isn't
gonna all of a sudden

877
00:39:35,115 --> 00:39:37,383
be nice to you,
and I won't stand by

878
00:39:37,451 --> 00:39:39,185
unable to do anything about it.

879
00:39:39,253 --> 00:39:43,189
Effective noon tomorrow,
Figgins is back in charge

880
00:39:43,257 --> 00:39:46,059
as I've tendered my resignation
as principal in protest.

881
00:39:46,126 --> 00:39:48,695
I can't help you behind that desk,

882
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:51,130
but I can be an extra pair of
eyes out in those hallways.

883
00:39:51,198 --> 00:39:53,066
Someone ought to have your back.

884
00:39:53,133 --> 00:39:56,169
Besides, I miss my office.
This room smells weird.

885
00:39:56,236 --> 00:39:59,172
I can't shake the feeling that
I'm inhaling a lot of dead skin.

886
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:05,712
Well, I guess I'll try to
enjoy the rest of the day,

887
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:07,180
before the terror starts anew.

888
00:40:07,247 --> 00:40:08,748
I'll see you at home.

889
00:40:10,718 --> 00:40:13,386
Hey, Kurt. Wait up a second.
There's something

890
00:40:13,454 --> 00:40:15,033
we want to talk to you about.

891
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,316
Come on, guys.
The wedding was great,

892
00:40:18,317 --> 00:40:21,160
but we have got to get ready
for Sectionals next week.

893
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:24,878
Kurt, good, I want to talk to
you about this amazing idea

894
00:40:24,879 --> 00:40:26,903
I had for a solo for
you at Sectionals.

895
00:40:26,904 --> 00:40:28,304
Can I make an announcement first?

896
00:40:28,372 --> 00:40:29,297
Yeah.

897
00:40:30,007 --> 00:40:32,809
First, I wanted to thank
everyone for what you did

898
00:40:32,877 --> 00:40:35,245
at my dad's wedding,
especially Finn.

899
00:40:35,312 --> 00:40:37,614
It's nice to know that I
have great friends here

900
00:40:37,681 --> 00:40:40,617
as well as a true brother.

901
00:40:40,684 --> 00:40:43,419
Which is why it's so
hard for me to leave.

902
00:40:44,788 --> 00:40:46,956
What do you mean, "Leave?"

903
00:40:47,024 --> 00:40:51,453
I'm transferring to Dalton
Academy... immediately.

904
00:40:52,263 --> 00:40:54,330
My parents are using
the money they saved up

905
00:40:54,398 --> 00:40:56,966
for their honeymoon to
pay for the tuition.

906
00:40:57,034 --> 00:40:58,701
Kurt, you can't leave.

907
00:40:58,769 --> 00:41:00,303
What the hell, dude?

908
00:41:00,371 --> 00:41:02,272
How about you talk with
me about this first?

909
00:41:02,339 --> 00:41:05,441
I'm sorry, Finn, but there's
nothing to talk about.

910
00:41:05,509 --> 00:41:06,676
Karofsky's coming back tomorrow,

911
00:41:06,744 --> 00:41:08,511
so that means I won't be.

912
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:10,647
We can protect you.
Seriously, we can, like,

913
00:41:10,714 --> 00:41:12,448
form a perimeter around you
like the Secret Service.

914
00:41:12,516 --> 00:41:13,716
Yeah. The only thing

915
00:41:13,784 --> 00:41:15,094
that can really protect
me is what they have

916
00:41:15,095 --> 00:41:20,098
a zero tolerance, no-
bullying policy. It's enforced.

917
