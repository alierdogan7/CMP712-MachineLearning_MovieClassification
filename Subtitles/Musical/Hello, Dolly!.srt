Dolly:

00:02:45,756 --> 00:02:48,486
Dolly: Social introductions
arranged...

00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:59,632
Woman: ...In an atmosphere
of elegance and refinement.

00:03:02,273 --> 00:03:04,707
Woman:
''Object--matrimony.''

8
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,725
Business trip or
pleasure trip, Mrs. Levi?

9
00:04:38,802 --> 00:04:40,736
Mr.Jones, with me,
business is always a pleasure.

10
00:04:40,804 --> 00:04:43,364
You've got more businesses
than a dog has fleas.

11
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,407
As my late husband
Ephraim used to say,

12
00:04:44,475 --> 00:04:47,103
if you have to live
from hand to mouth,

13
00:04:47,177 --> 00:04:48,974
you'd better be
ambidextrous.

14
00:04:49,046 --> 00:04:50,809
Ha ha ha!

15
00:05:24,548 --> 00:05:25,913
Where to, Dolly?

16
00:05:25,983 --> 00:05:28,213
Yonkers, to handle
a highly personal matter

17
00:05:28,285 --> 00:05:30,219
for Mr. Horace
Vandergelder,

18
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:31,720
the well-known,

19
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:32,778
unmarried
half-a-millionaire.

20
00:05:32,856 --> 00:05:35,222
Gonna marry him
yourself, Dolly?

21
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:37,760
Whatever put such
a preposterous idea

22
00:05:37,828 --> 00:05:39,090
into my head--

23
00:05:39,163 --> 00:05:41,131
Your head. Oh!

24
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:07,952
Don't be ashamed, girls.

25
00:06:08,025 --> 00:06:09,822
Life is full of secrets,
and I keep 'em!

26
00:09:13,361 --> 00:09:15,386
[Ding Ding]

27
00:09:48,229 --> 00:09:50,663
I've told you
a thousand times

28
00:09:50,731 --> 00:09:52,665
that I will
marry her!

29
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:54,667
Not without my permission
you won't!

30
00:09:54,735 --> 00:09:56,566
This is
a free country!

31
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,502
She's consented and
I'm going to marry her!

32
00:09:58,573 --> 00:10:00,200
I'm telling you
that you will not!

33
00:10:00,274 --> 00:10:01,798
And I'm telling you
I will!

34
00:10:01,876 --> 00:10:02,968
Never!

35
00:10:03,044 --> 00:10:04,204
Tomorrow! Today!

36
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:05,711
Ermengarde's not for you
nor anybody else...

37
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,179
who can't support her.
You are an artist!

38
00:10:07,248 --> 00:10:09,182
I make a very good
living!

39
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,184
A living's made
by selling

40
00:10:11,252 --> 00:10:13,186
something everybody
needs at least once a year,

41
00:10:13,254 --> 00:10:16,189
and a million is made
by producing something

42
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:18,191
everybody needs
every single day.

43
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:20,193
You artists,
you painters,

44
00:10:20,261 --> 00:10:22,627
produce nothing
that nobody needs never!

45
00:10:22,697 --> 00:10:25,564
You might as well know,
any way we find to get married

46
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:27,863
is right and fair,
and we'll do it!

47
00:10:27,935 --> 00:10:31,200
You are an impractical,
7-foot-tall nincompoop!

48
00:10:31,272 --> 00:10:32,705
That's an insult!

49
00:10:32,773 --> 00:10:35,207
All facts about you
are insults!

50
00:10:35,276 --> 00:10:37,244
Thank you for the honor
of your visit!

51
00:10:37,311 --> 00:10:39,711
Ermengarde's of age.
There's no law--

52
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,714
Law?! Let me
tell you something.

53
00:10:41,782 --> 00:10:43,716
The law's there
to prevent crime.

54
00:10:43,784 --> 00:10:45,718
We men of sense are there
to prevent foolishness.

55
00:10:45,786 --> 00:10:47,219
I, not the law,
will prevent you

56
00:10:47,288 --> 00:10:48,755
from marrying
my niece!

57
00:10:48,823 --> 00:10:50,723
I've already taken
the necessary steps.

58
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,726
Mrs. Dolly Levi's
on her way here now.

59
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:55,728
Dolly Levi--
your marriage broker?

60
00:10:55,796 --> 00:10:57,320
She's going to
take Ermengarde

61
00:10:57,398 --> 00:10:58,729
to New York--

62
00:10:58,799 --> 00:10:59,857
New York?

63
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:01,731
Yes! And keep her there
until this foolishness

64
00:11:01,802 --> 00:11:03,167
is out of her head
and yours.

65
00:11:03,237 --> 00:11:04,670
We'll see
about that!

66
00:11:04,739 --> 00:11:07,173
Thank you again for the honor
of your visit and good morning!

67
00:11:07,241 --> 00:11:09,175
You'll have to sit still,
Mr. Vandergelder.

68
00:11:09,243 --> 00:11:11,768
If I cut your throat,
it'll be practically unintentional.

69
00:11:11,846 --> 00:11:14,212
Ah, 90% of people
are fools,

70
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:16,182
and the rest of us

71
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,218
are in great danger
of contamination.

72
00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:21,187
Enough! I'm a busy man
with things to do.

73
00:11:21,255 --> 00:11:24,053
A scraped chin
is the least of them!

74
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:27,526
I did the best I could,
Mr. Vandergelder.

75
00:11:29,463 --> 00:11:30,555
Joe?

76
00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:31,859
Yes?

77
00:11:31,932 --> 00:11:35,231
I've got special reasons
for looking my best today.

78
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:37,294
Is there something
extra you can do--

79
00:11:37,371 --> 00:11:38,702
Something
a little special?

80
00:11:38,773 --> 00:11:39,831
What?

81
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,705
Those things you do
to the young fellows.

82
00:11:42,777 --> 00:11:44,711
Smarten me up
a little bit.

83
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:47,247
You know, face massage,
little perfume water.

84
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:49,647
All I know is,
1 5 cents' worth,

85
00:11:49,717 --> 00:11:50,706
like usual.

86
00:11:50,785 --> 00:11:52,309
That includes
everything

87
00:11:52,386 --> 00:11:54,320
that's decent
to do to a man.

88
00:11:54,388 --> 00:11:56,151
I don't want you blabbing
this at the barber shop,

89
00:11:56,223 --> 00:11:57,656
but I need something
extra today

90
00:11:57,725 --> 00:11:59,215
because I'm going
to New York

91
00:11:59,293 --> 00:12:03,229
to call on a refined lady--
name of Miss Irene Molloy.

92
00:12:03,297 --> 00:12:06,698
Your calling on ladies
is none of my business.

93
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,166
Hold your horses,Joe!

94
00:12:08,235 --> 00:12:09,827
Uncle Horace!
Uncle Horace!

95
00:12:09,904 --> 00:12:10,996
What, Ermengarde?

96
00:12:11,072 --> 00:12:13,506
What have you done
to Ambrose?

97
00:12:13,574 --> 00:12:15,303
I had a quiet
little talk with him.

98
00:12:15,376 --> 00:12:16,400
You did?

99
00:12:16,477 --> 00:12:19,037
Yes. I explained to him
that he's a fool.

100
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,171
Oh, Uncle!

101
00:12:20,247 --> 00:12:22,477
Weeping, weeping--
a waste of water.

102
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,144
I've done you a good turn.
'ou'll come thank me when you're 5(

103
00:12:25,219 --> 00:12:27,483
But, Uncle, I love him.

104
00:12:27,555 --> 00:12:28,954
Save your tears
for New York

105
00:12:29,023 --> 00:12:30,012
where they won't
be noticed.

106
00:12:30,091 --> 00:12:31,718
But I love him!

107
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:32,724
I tell you that you don't!

108
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,727
Leave those things
to me.

109
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,729
If I don't
marry Ambrose,

110
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,231
I'll die
of a broken heart!

111
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,029
Never heard of it.

112
00:12:41,102 --> 00:12:43,070
Are you ready
for Mrs. Levi?

113
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,195
Yes.

114
00:12:44,271 --> 00:12:47,240
Well, stay in your room
until she arrives.

115
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,469
[Crying]

116
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,879
Cornelius!

117
00:12:55,282 --> 00:12:56,681
Barnaby!

118
00:12:57,952 --> 00:12:59,180
Barnaby!

119
00:13:00,621 --> 00:13:02,054
Cornelius!

120
00:13:02,123 --> 00:13:03,454
Barnaby!

121
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:10,963
You stamped,
Mr. Vandergelder?

122
00:13:11,031 --> 00:13:12,965
Yes, I stamped.

123
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:15,297
Are my niece's bags
at the railroad station?

124
00:13:15,369 --> 00:13:17,269
Yes, Mr. Vandergelder.

125
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,329
And you, did you label
them properly?

126
00:13:19,407 --> 00:13:20,374
Yes, Mr. Vandergelder.

127
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:22,341
Good. Look, I'm going
to New York today.

128
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,776
I'll be marching
in the 1 4th Street parade.

129
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:25,869
Yes, Mr. Vandergelder.

130
00:13:25,946 --> 00:13:28,312
I'm staying overnight
at the Central Hotel.

131
00:13:28,382 --> 00:13:30,316
We've never
been here alone.

132
00:13:30,384 --> 00:13:31,783
In honor
of the occasion,

133
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,513
I'm going to promote
you both.

134
00:13:33,587 --> 00:13:35,487
Cornelius,
how old are you?

135
00:13:35,556 --> 00:13:37,023
28 3/ 4,
Mr. Vandergelder.

136
00:13:37,091 --> 00:13:38,490
Is that all?

137
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:40,322
That's a foolish
age to be at.

138
00:13:40,394 --> 00:13:42,763
I thought
you were 40.

139
00:13:42,897 --> 00:13:44,990
No. I'm 28 3/ 4.

140
00:13:45,065 --> 00:13:48,967
Man's not worth a cent
until he's 40.

141
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,971
We pay him until then
to make mistakes.

142
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,631
Anyway, you're promoted
to chief clerk.

143
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,504
Chief clerk?

144
00:13:55,576 --> 00:13:57,305
What am I now?

145
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,777
You're
an impertinent fool!

146
00:13:58,846 --> 00:14:00,780
If you behave yourself,
I'll promote you

147
00:14:00,848 --> 00:14:02,475
from impertinent fool
to chief clerk

148
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:03,914
with a raise
in your wages.

149
00:14:03,984 --> 00:14:06,418
Oh, thank you,
Mr. Vandergelder.

150
00:14:06,487 --> 00:14:07,818
You, Barnaby,

151
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,049
I'm promoting you
from idiot apprentice

152
00:14:10,124 --> 00:14:11,591
to incompetent clerk.

153
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:12,921
Thank you,
Mr. Vandergelder.

154
00:14:12,993 --> 00:14:14,585
Mr. Vandergelder?
Mr. Vandergelder?

155
00:14:14,662 --> 00:14:15,720
What is it?

156
00:14:15,796 --> 00:14:19,732
Does a chief clerk get
one evening off a week?

157
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,462
So that's the way
you thank me, eh?

158
00:14:22,536 --> 00:14:25,266
No, sir! You'll attend
to the store as usual!

159
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:27,102
An evening free.

160
00:14:27,174 --> 00:14:28,766
Keep asking
for evenings free,

161
00:14:28,842 --> 00:14:30,776
and you'll find yourself
with your days free.

162
00:14:30,844 --> 00:14:32,072
Remember that.

163
00:14:32,146 --> 00:14:33,374
Yes, Mr. Vandergelder.

164
00:14:33,447 --> 00:14:35,779
Listen I want you to run
the place perfectly

165
00:14:35,849 --> 00:14:36,975
in my absence.

166
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:40,179
If I hear of foolishness,
I'll discharge you both.

167
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,654
You might as well know now,
when I return from New York,

168
00:14:42,723 --> 00:14:45,157
there'll be some changes
around here.

169
00:14:45,225 --> 00:14:46,157
Changes?

170
00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:47,750
Yes, you're going
to have a mistress.

171
00:14:47,828 --> 00:14:49,921
I'm too young,
Mr. Vandergelder.

172
00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:53,599
Not yours, idiot. Mine.

173
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:55,658
I mean I'm planning
to get married.

174
00:14:55,736 --> 00:14:56,634
Married?

175
00:14:56,704 --> 00:14:57,966
Any objections?

176
00:14:58,038 --> 00:14:59,471
No, but--

177
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,474
Many congratulations,
Mr. Vandergelder,

178
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:03,407
and to the lady, too.

179
00:15:03,477 --> 00:15:04,944
That's none
of your business!

180
00:15:05,012 --> 00:15:06,206
Any further questions?

181
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,212
No, but--

182
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,213
But why what?

183
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,249
Speak up! What?

184
00:15:09,316 --> 00:15:10,214
Why?

185
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,410
Why what, damn it?!

186
00:15:11,485 --> 00:15:13,578
Why are you
getting married?

187
00:15:15,155 --> 00:15:17,419
Let me tell you
something, son.

188
00:15:17,491 --> 00:15:20,949
I've worked hard,
and I've become rich...

189
00:15:21,028 --> 00:15:23,428
and friendless and mean.

190
00:15:23,497 --> 00:15:28,298
In America, that's about
as far as you can go.

191
00:15:28,369 --> 00:15:30,599
[Neigh]

192
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:36,943
It's time to be doing something
a little bit foolish.

193
00:15:37,011 --> 00:15:39,713
Besides, I need
a steady housekeeper.

194
00:15:39,713 --> 00:15:40,145
Besides, I need
a steady housekeeper.

195
00:17:17,044 --> 00:17:19,171
[Neigh]

196
00:18:37,858 --> 00:18:40,258
Well, well,
well, well, well.

197
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:43,819
Good morning,
Mr. Vandergelder,

198
00:18:43,897 --> 00:18:45,091
Mr. Hackl,

199
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,632
Mr. Tucker.

200
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,258
Gentlemen.

201
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,462
Good morning Mrs. Levi.

202
00:18:50,537 --> 00:18:53,062
Uh, good morning,
Mrs. Levi.

203
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,074
How handsome
you look today.

204
00:18:55,142 --> 00:18:57,110
Ooh. You absolutely
take my breath away.

205
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,202
Ermengarde's upstairs
crying her eyes out.

206
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:01,144
You can take her now,
but blow her nose first.

207
00:19:01,215 --> 00:19:04,241
If only Irene Molloy
could see you now.

208
00:19:04,318 --> 00:19:06,252
Uh, find someplace else
to loaf!.

209
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,254
And you two get back
to the store!

210
00:19:08,322 --> 00:19:10,586
Don't forget to put the lid
on the sheep dip!

211
00:19:10,657 --> 00:19:13,785
I don't know what's
come over you lately,

212
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,795
but you seem to grow
younger every day.

213
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,262
If a man eats careful,

214
00:19:18,332 --> 00:19:20,266
there's no reason
why he should look old.

215
00:19:20,334 --> 00:19:22,768
You never said
a truer word.

216
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:26,438
Even if I never see
40--3 5 again...

217
00:19:26,572 --> 00:19:28,267
3 5. Why I can see
at a glance

218
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,274
you'll be stamping
about at 1 00,

219
00:19:30,342 --> 00:19:32,276
eating 5 meals a day
just like my uncle,

220
00:19:32,344 --> 00:19:33,868
may he rest in peace.

221
00:19:33,946 --> 00:19:35,743
Let me see your hand,
Mr. Vandergelder.

222
00:19:35,814 --> 00:19:36,746
Oh, show me your hand.

223
00:19:36,815 --> 00:19:37,782
Why?

224
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:40,215
I'm a judge of hands.
I read hands.

225
00:19:40,285 --> 00:19:42,446
I use them
to get things done.

226
00:19:42,521 --> 00:19:44,489
Lord in heaven!
Goodness gracious!

227
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:46,490
I just can't believe it!

228
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:49,959
Such a long life line,
from here to here.

229
00:19:50,028 --> 00:19:52,462
It runs right off
your hand.

230
00:19:52,531 --> 00:19:54,226
They'll have to hit you
with a mallet.

231
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,233
They'll have to stifle
you with a sofa pillow.

232
00:19:56,301 --> 00:19:57,791
You will bury us all.

233
00:19:57,869 --> 00:19:59,336
I will?

234
00:19:59,404 --> 00:20:00,336
Say...

235
00:20:00,405 --> 00:20:01,463
Yes?

236
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,667
You're all spiffed up
today, aren't you?

237
00:20:03,742 --> 00:20:04,800
Yes.

238
00:20:04,876 --> 00:20:07,811
And not for the benefit
of this smelly horse.

239
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:09,813
Well, if I had a guess,

240
00:20:09,881 --> 00:20:12,475
I'd say you was goin'
somewhere.

241
00:20:14,886 --> 00:20:17,821
Remarkable, Mrs. Levi.
How do you do it?

242
00:20:17,889 --> 00:20:20,084
2 and 2 is 4,
Mr. Vandergelder.

243
00:20:20,158 --> 00:20:23,457
With a head like yours,
you'll be rich someday.

244
00:20:23,528 --> 00:20:25,826
That's exactly
what I had in mind.

245
00:20:25,897 --> 00:20:27,728
Then I suggest
you pick up Ermengarde,

246
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:30,529
for which I'm paying you
good money.

247
00:20:30,602 --> 00:20:33,332
Speaking of business,
Mr. Vandergelder,

248
00:20:33,405 --> 00:20:35,339
I suppose
you've given up

249
00:20:35,407 --> 00:20:37,204
all idea
of getting married.

250
00:20:37,275 --> 00:20:38,867
Is that
what you suppose?

251
00:20:38,944 --> 00:20:42,107
Then suppose you listen
to this, Mrs. Levi.

252
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,341
I've decided--
I've practically decided

253
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,214
to ask Irene Molloy
to be my wife.

254
00:20:47,285 --> 00:20:49,549
You have?

255
00:20:49,621 --> 00:20:50,679
Yeah, I have.

256
00:20:50,756 --> 00:20:52,724
I'm going to New York
and discuss it with her.

257
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,122
This very afternoon.

258
00:20:56,428 --> 00:20:59,363
Well, that is just
about the best news

259
00:20:59,431 --> 00:21:01,365
I have ever heard,
Mr. Vandergelder.

260
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:03,298
Oh, yes, indeed,
marvelous news.

261
00:21:03,368 --> 00:21:04,835
Isn't it wonderful,
though?

262
00:21:04,903 --> 00:21:06,234
I'm wracking
my brain here.

263
00:21:06,304 --> 00:21:08,329
I'm trying to think
of something I've heard

264
00:21:08,407 --> 00:21:10,068
that has made me
happier,

265
00:21:10,142 --> 00:21:11,905
but I just can't
come up with a thing.

266
00:21:11,977 --> 00:21:13,808
It's just so wonderful.
It really is.

267
00:21:13,879 --> 00:21:16,109
It's all your fault,
you know.

268
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:19,309
You put me into this
marrying frame of mind

269
00:21:19,384 --> 00:21:20,749
with your introductions
and scheming.

270
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:22,753
A poor widow must earn
a living.

271
00:21:22,821 --> 00:21:24,288
One morning I wake up

272
00:21:24,356 --> 00:21:26,847
and suddenly the house
seems like an empty shell...

273
00:21:26,925 --> 00:21:28,483
and pretty messy, too.

274
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,654
A man needs someone
to take out the garbage.

275
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,755
And Irene Molloy's
the one to do it.

276
00:21:33,832 --> 00:21:34,764
Darling girl.

277
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,494
I think it's
perfectly wonderful

278
00:21:36,568 --> 00:21:37,762
what's gonna happen
in your household,

279
00:21:37,836 --> 00:21:39,531
Mr. Vandergelder.

280
00:21:39,604 --> 00:21:42,266
I never did like
the idea of all that--

281
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,308
All that money of yours

282
00:21:44,376 --> 00:21:46,276
lying in great piles
in the bank,

283
00:21:46,344 --> 00:21:48,312
so useless
and motionless.

284
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,780
As my late husband
Ephraim used to say,

285
00:21:50,849 --> 00:21:53,215
''Money should circulate
like rainwater.

286
00:21:53,285 --> 00:21:56,277
''It should be flowing
down among the people

287
00:21:56,354 --> 00:21:58,788
''through dressmakers,
cabmen, and restaurants.

288
00:21:58,857 --> 00:22:00,324
''Setting up
a business here,

289
00:22:00,392 --> 00:22:01,791
furnishing a good time
over there.''

290
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,226
Oh, you and the future
Mrs. Vandergelder

291
00:22:04,296 --> 00:22:07,231
will see that all
your hard-earned wealth

292
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:10,234
flows in and around
many peoples' lives--

293
00:22:10,302 --> 00:22:12,236
Just flowing,
pouring out.

294
00:22:12,304 --> 00:22:14,272
All right.
Stop saying that!

295
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:16,432
I wish you happiness
under the sun,

296
00:22:16,508 --> 00:22:18,567
and good-bye,
Mr. Vandergelder.

297
00:22:18,643 --> 00:22:19,735
Yes, well,
good-bye.

298
00:22:19,811 --> 00:22:21,574
And when I get back
to New York,

299
00:22:21,646 --> 00:22:23,546
I'll tell the heiress
not to wait.

300
00:22:23,615 --> 00:22:25,014
What did you say?

301
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:28,484
Oh, nothing, nothing.
A word-- <i>heiress.</i>

302
00:22:28,553 --> 00:22:30,043
Well,just a minute.

303
00:22:30,122 --> 00:22:33,182
That's kind of unusual,
isn't it, Mrs. Levi?

304
00:22:33,258 --> 00:22:36,056
I haven't been
hunting usual girls

305
00:22:36,128 --> 00:22:37,891
to interest you,
Mr. Vandergelder,

306
00:22:37,963 --> 00:22:39,590
but now all that
is too late.

307
00:22:39,664 --> 00:22:41,427
You're engaged
to Irene Molloy.

308
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,626
I'm not engaged.

309
00:22:42,701 --> 00:22:45,067
I can't keep disturbing
these fine women

310
00:22:45,137 --> 00:22:46,604
unless
you mean business.

311
00:22:46,671 --> 00:22:48,195
Who said
I don't mean business?

312
00:22:48,273 --> 00:22:50,764
You're playing
a dangerous game.

313
00:22:50,842 --> 00:22:51,740
Dangerous?

314
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:52,902
Of course
it's dangerous.

315
00:22:52,978 --> 00:22:55,446
It's tampering with
a woman's affections,

316
00:22:55,514 --> 00:22:56,913
and the only way
to save yourself

317
00:22:56,982 --> 00:22:58,313
from that charge,
Mr. Vandergelder,

318
00:22:58,383 --> 00:23:01,250
is to get married
to someone soon--

319
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:02,308
Very soon.

320
00:23:02,387 --> 00:23:03,684
Don't worry.

321
00:23:03,755 --> 00:23:04,779
I won't.

322
00:23:04,856 --> 00:23:06,448
I'll meet you in front
of Molloy's hat shop

323
00:23:06,525 --> 00:23:07,856
at 2:30 as usual.

324
00:23:07,926 --> 00:23:10,394
Never mind. No need to.
You've done your work.

325
00:23:10,462 --> 00:23:12,362
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

326
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,523
I'll be there to ensure
that nothing goes wrong.

327
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:16,032
Just tend
to Ermengarde

328
00:23:16,101 --> 00:23:18,831
or return the fee
I gave you.

329
00:23:18,904 --> 00:23:21,702
Speaking of money,
I almost forgot--

330
00:23:21,773 --> 00:23:23,035
How much?

331
00:23:23,108 --> 00:23:24,905
I left all my money
in my other handbag

332
00:23:24,976 --> 00:23:27,035
which burned in a fire
at cleaners--50?

333
00:23:27,112 --> 00:23:28,044
50?

334
00:23:28,113 --> 00:23:30,047
Plenty.
Oh, bless you.

335
00:23:30,115 --> 00:23:32,083
And don't worry
your handsome head

336
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,378
about a thing.

337
00:23:33,451 --> 00:23:35,385
Just keep
all your thoughts

338
00:23:35,453 --> 00:23:37,546
on that lovely
Irene Molloy.

339
00:23:45,764 --> 00:23:47,322
[BellJingles]

340
00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:49,560
[JingleJingle]

341
00:25:10,048 --> 00:25:12,016
[Humming]

342
00:25:31,937 --> 00:25:34,872
If he had any taste
at all,

343
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,569
he'd have the shutters
done over in green.

344
00:25:38,643 --> 00:25:39,905
Mmm...

345
00:25:39,978 --> 00:25:42,037
forest green shutters.

346
00:25:42,981 --> 00:25:44,881
What are
you doing?

347
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,680
Get away!
My uncle!

348
00:25:47,752 --> 00:25:49,276
He's not here.

349
00:25:49,354 --> 00:25:51,379
Now, quick.
We're running away.

350
00:25:51,456 --> 00:25:53,924
Hurry, before
the train gets here.

351
00:25:53,992 --> 00:25:55,050
Train?

352
00:25:55,126 --> 00:25:57,253
New York. To be married.
We're going to elope.

353
00:25:57,329 --> 00:25:59,729
Elope? How can you
use that awful word?

354
00:25:59,798 --> 00:26:02,198
Oh, Ermengarde.

355
00:26:02,267 --> 00:26:05,031
My, what a romantic scene.

356
00:26:05,103 --> 00:26:08,095
I want to marry Ambrose
but not elope!

357
00:26:08,173 --> 00:26:09,988
This doesn't concern
Mrs. Levi.

358
00:26:10,122 --> 00:26:12,022
Everything concerns
Dolly Levi.

359
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,182
Don't listen.

360
00:26:13,258 --> 00:26:14,748
I know why
you're here.

361
00:26:14,826 --> 00:26:16,259
To help you,

362
00:26:16,328 --> 00:26:17,693
and love needs
all the help it can get.

363
00:26:17,762 --> 00:26:19,286
Listen, both of you.

364
00:26:19,364 --> 00:26:20,661
There's no time.

365
00:26:20,732 --> 00:26:23,997
I'm feeling an updraft
in my underpants.

366
00:26:24,069 --> 00:26:26,333
This is no way
to elope.

367
00:26:26,404 --> 00:26:27,871
If you follow
my suggestions,

368
00:26:27,939 --> 00:26:29,338
Horace Vandergelder will
not only give permission

369
00:26:29,407 --> 00:26:31,637
but he'll dance
at your wedding,

370
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,678
and not alone either.

371
00:26:33,745 --> 00:26:35,713
Mr. Kemper,
can you dance?

372
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,678
Dance?

373
00:26:36,748 --> 00:26:37,715
Yes, dance.

374
00:26:37,782 --> 00:26:39,511
I'm an artist.
I paint.

375
00:26:39,584 --> 00:26:40,881
No problem.

376
00:26:40,952 --> 00:26:42,852
''Painters taught
how to dance.''

377
00:26:42,921 --> 00:26:45,389
I'll take you
to New York.

378
00:26:45,457 --> 00:26:46,856
See? I told you!

379
00:26:46,925 --> 00:26:48,859
You will stay
close by.

380
00:26:48,927 --> 00:26:50,861
You'll take her
to dinner

381
00:26:50,929 --> 00:26:53,056
at the Harmonia
Gardens restaurant.

382
00:26:53,131 --> 00:26:55,224
You'll enter
the polka contest.

383
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,858
Polka contest?

384
00:26:56,935 --> 00:26:58,698
The prize
is a gold cup

385
00:26:58,770 --> 00:26:59,862
and money.

386
00:26:59,938 --> 00:27:02,566
The cups we won,
my husband and I.

387
00:27:02,641 --> 00:27:04,006
Now wait a minute.

388
00:27:04,075 --> 00:27:06,305
I'm surprised you have
acquaintances like that.

389
00:27:06,378 --> 00:27:09,506
Not acquaintances,
Ermengarde, friends--

390
00:27:09,581 --> 00:27:12,812
Dear friends
from days gone by.

391
00:27:12,884 --> 00:27:15,318
My late husband Ephraim
believed in life--

392
00:27:15,387 --> 00:27:17,355
anyplace
you could find it--

393
00:27:17,422 --> 00:27:18,855
wherever
there were people,

394
00:27:18,924 --> 00:27:20,323
all kinds of people.

395
00:27:20,392 --> 00:27:21,825
And every Friday night,

396
00:27:21,893 --> 00:27:24,327
even when times
were bad--

397
00:27:24,396 --> 00:27:27,331
Every Friday night,
like clockwork,

398
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:30,334
down those stairs
of the Harmonia Gardens

399
00:27:30,402 --> 00:27:32,836
we came,
Ephraim and I.

400
00:27:34,773 --> 00:27:37,833
Not acquaintances,
Ermengarde--friends.

401
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:39,638
It's all very well
for you, Mrs. Levi,

402
00:27:39,711 --> 00:27:41,178
but you're suggesting--

403
00:27:41,246 --> 00:27:43,214
Do you want
to show Horace

404
00:27:43,281 --> 00:27:45,010
that you
mean business?

405
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:47,074
- Yes!
- Yes!

406
00:27:47,152 --> 00:27:48,585
Well, you must go

407
00:27:48,653 --> 00:27:50,177
to the Harmonia
Gardens restaurant.

408
00:27:50,255 --> 00:27:52,348
Say that Mrs. Levi
sent you...

409
00:27:52,424 --> 00:27:53,857
and, yes, well...

410
00:27:53,925 --> 00:27:56,393
tell Rudolph that
Dolly's coming back.

411
00:27:56,461 --> 00:27:58,224
Dolly's coming back.

412
00:27:58,296 --> 00:27:59,854
Yes. I want a table
for two

413
00:27:59,931 --> 00:28:01,398
and stuffed chicken
for 8:00.

414
00:28:01,466 --> 00:28:02,398
Mr. Vandergelder

415
00:28:02,467 --> 00:28:04,332
will learn
of your triumph.

416
00:28:04,402 --> 00:28:06,097
Everything will work
out beautifully.

417
00:28:06,171 --> 00:28:08,332
But how, Mrs. Levi?

418
00:28:08,406 --> 00:28:10,397
How? Ha ha ha!

419
00:28:10,475 --> 00:28:13,137
Ha--Ohh.

420
00:28:13,211 --> 00:28:14,769
28 3/ 4 years old

421
00:28:14,846 --> 00:28:17,440
and I still don't
get an evening free!

422
00:28:17,515 --> 00:28:20,678
When am I gonna
begin to live?

423
00:28:22,387 --> 00:28:26,084
Barnaby, how much
money have you got?

424
00:28:26,157 --> 00:28:27,317
Huh?

425
00:28:27,392 --> 00:28:29,826
That you can get
your hands on?

426
00:28:29,894 --> 00:28:31,657
About $3.00. Why?

427
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,664
Barnaby,
you and I

428
00:28:33,732 --> 00:28:35,666
are going
to New York!

429
00:28:35,734 --> 00:28:37,668
We can't close
the store!

430
00:28:37,736 --> 00:28:38,828
We'll have to,

431
00:28:38,903 --> 00:28:40,837
'cause some rotten cans
of chicken mash

432
00:28:40,905 --> 00:28:42,372
are going to explode.

433
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,964
Holy cabooses!
How do you know?

434
00:28:44,042 --> 00:28:46,169
'Cause I'm gonna
light candles under them.

435
00:28:46,244 --> 00:28:48,144
They'll make
such a stink

436
00:28:48,213 --> 00:28:51,148
customers won't come in
for 2 4 hours!

437
00:28:51,216 --> 00:28:54,652
We're going to New York,
and we're gonna live!

438
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:57,688
We'll have a good meal,
we're gonna be in danger,

439
00:28:57,756 --> 00:29:00,350
get almost arrested,
and spend all our money!

440
00:29:00,425 --> 00:29:02,484
Holy cabooses!

441
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,461
And we are not coming
back to Yonkers

442
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,623
until we've each
kissed a girl.

443
00:29:07,699 --> 00:29:10,634
Cornelius,
you can't do that.

444
00:29:10,702 --> 00:29:13,102
You don't know
any girls.

445
00:29:13,171 --> 00:29:15,605
I'm 28 3/ 4.

446
00:29:15,674 --> 00:29:18,142
I've got to begin
sometime.

447
00:29:18,209 --> 00:29:19,938
I'm only 1 9 1 /2.

448
00:29:20,011 --> 00:29:22,343
With me,
it's not so urgent.

449
00:29:22,414 --> 00:29:25,144
May I make
a suggestion?

450
00:29:25,216 --> 00:29:26,444
Mrs. Levi!

451
00:29:26,518 --> 00:29:28,213
I just couldn't
help hearing.

452
00:29:28,286 --> 00:29:29,310
We'll be fired.

453
00:29:29,387 --> 00:29:31,150
We were only talking!

454
00:29:31,222 --> 00:29:33,622
Mr. Hackl, Mr. Tucker,

455
00:29:33,692 --> 00:29:35,819
there's nothing
that makes me happier

456
00:29:35,894 --> 00:29:37,862
than the thought
of 2 fine young men

457
00:29:37,929 --> 00:29:39,328
such as yourselves

458
00:29:39,397 --> 00:29:41,627
enjoying the company
of 2 lovely ladies.

459
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,531
What ladies? Where?

460
00:29:43,601 --> 00:29:45,068
In New York,
to which,

461
00:29:45,136 --> 00:29:47,161
unless my ears
play tricks,

462
00:29:47,238 --> 00:29:49,138
you are bound.

463
00:29:49,207 --> 00:29:50,640
Now, there's
this millinery shop

464
00:29:50,709 --> 00:29:52,472
run by
a charming woman.

465
00:29:52,544 --> 00:29:54,171
''Irene Molloy.''

466
00:29:54,245 --> 00:29:56,679
And her assistant,
Miss Minnie Fay.

467
00:29:56,748 --> 00:29:57,908
Holy cabooses!

468
00:29:57,982 --> 00:30:00,507
And now that you've
noted the address,

469
00:30:00,585 --> 00:30:01,677
I have only this
to say--

470
00:30:01,753 --> 00:30:03,653
2:00
in the afternoon

471
00:30:03,722 --> 00:30:06,156
is the ideal time
for conversation--

472
00:30:06,224 --> 00:30:08,192
definitely
no later than 2:30.

473
00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:11,160
If you ever say this
was my suggestion,

474
00:30:11,229 --> 00:30:12,696
well, I shall
denounce you both

475
00:30:12,764 --> 00:30:14,857
for the terrible
liars you are.

476
00:30:16,401 --> 00:30:19,165
Ohhh!

477
00:30:19,237 --> 00:30:21,171
A millinery shop.

478
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:23,173
Women who work.

479
00:30:23,241 --> 00:30:24,173
Adventure, Barnaby!

480
00:30:24,242 --> 00:30:25,402
I'm scared.

481
00:30:25,477 --> 00:30:26,375
Living, Barnaby!

482
00:30:26,444 --> 00:30:27,411
I'm scared.

483
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:29,208
Will you come,
Barnaby?

484
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,180
Yes, Cornelius! Yes!

485
00:30:31,249 --> 00:30:33,683
The lights of Broadway,
elevated trains,

486
00:30:33,752 --> 00:30:36,186
the stuffed whale
at Barnum's Museum!

487
00:30:36,254 --> 00:30:38,848
Stuffed whale. Wow!

488
00:30:38,923 --> 00:30:40,686
Women who work!

489
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:42,226
Wow!

490
00:30:42,293 --> 00:30:44,227
All clear up here,
Cornelius!

491
00:30:44,295 --> 00:30:46,058
You gonna light 'em all?

492
00:30:46,131 --> 00:30:47,393
Hey, Cornelius, look out!

493
00:30:47,465 --> 00:30:50,195
That bottom row's swelled up
like they're ready to bust!

[Popping]

495
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,204
Holy cabooses!
What a smell!

496
00:30:54,272 --> 00:30:57,708
Get dressed, Barnaby!
We're going to New York!

497
00:31:27,739 --> 00:31:29,832
[Popping]

498
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,074
Ermengarde, keep smiling.

499
00:35:02,152 --> 00:35:04,313
No man wants
a little ninny.

500
00:35:04,388 --> 00:35:06,413
Ambrose, do a turn,
let me see.

501
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:10,221
Mr. Hackl, Mr. Tucker,
don't forget Irene and Minnie,

502
00:35:10,293 --> 00:35:13,353
just forget you ever
heard a word from me.

503
00:36:29,439 --> 00:36:31,498
[Train Whistle Blows]

504
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:34,277
Do get done
with that, Minnie.

505
00:36:34,277 --> 00:36:35,835
Do get done
with that, Minnie.

506
00:36:35,912 --> 00:36:38,881
The men are eyeing us
for the wrong reason.

507
00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:40,883
A banana a day keeps
the doctor away.

508
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:42,077
You mean an apple a day.

509
00:36:42,152 --> 00:36:44,586
Who ever heard of a doctor
slipping on apple peel?

510
00:36:44,654 --> 00:36:46,053
How are you,
Miss Molloy?

511
00:36:46,123 --> 00:36:48,318
If I felt any better,
I'd be positively indecent.

512
00:36:48,391 --> 00:36:50,018
Oh, you <i>are</i> in
a mood today.

513
00:36:50,093 --> 00:36:51,355
Oh, I certainly am.

514
00:36:52,929 --> 00:36:55,557
Not that it's any
of my business,

515
00:36:55,632 --> 00:36:57,361
but is it because--

516
00:36:57,434 --> 00:36:58,901
Minnie,
I don't mind

517
00:36:58,969 --> 00:37:00,402
that you never
finish your lunch,

518
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,904
but do mind that you never
finish your sentences.

519
00:37:02,973 --> 00:37:04,804
Are you really
going to--I mean--

520
00:37:04,875 --> 00:37:06,308
Silly girl, say it.

521
00:37:06,376 --> 00:37:08,310
Am I marrying
Horace Vandergelder?

522
00:37:08,378 --> 00:37:11,313
Yes, I'm considering it
if he asks me.

523
00:37:11,381 --> 00:37:13,315
Oh, I'd rather die
on the rack

524
00:37:13,383 --> 00:37:15,317
than ask such
a personal question,

525
00:37:15,385 --> 00:37:17,319
but as long as
we're on the subject,

526
00:37:17,387 --> 00:37:18,854
why would you? I mean--

527
00:37:18,922 --> 00:37:19,820
Because he's rich.

528
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:21,357
He can rescue me
from the millinery.

529
00:37:21,424 --> 00:37:22,356
I hate hats.

530
00:37:22,425 --> 00:37:23,551
Hate hats?

531
00:37:23,627 --> 00:37:25,561
Good afternoon to you,
Officer Gogarty.

532
00:37:25,629 --> 00:37:28,189
And the rest
of the day to you,

533
00:37:28,265 --> 00:37:29,323
Miss Molloy.

534
00:37:29,399 --> 00:37:31,697
Ah, Minnie, why is it
all the attractive men

535
00:37:31,768 --> 00:37:33,030
in New York are married?

536
00:37:33,103 --> 00:37:36,038
Blarney, Miss Molloy!
Blarney!

537
00:37:36,106 --> 00:37:38,074
Come on, get going!
All of you!

538
00:37:38,141 --> 00:37:39,506
[Giggling]

539
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:43,078
Oh, the way
you talk!

540
00:37:43,146 --> 00:37:46,047
It's natural
to talk about men.

541
00:37:46,116 --> 00:37:47,879
I mean, what you said
about hating hats.

542
00:37:47,951 --> 00:37:48,849
Not just hats.

543
00:37:48,919 --> 00:37:50,546
Particularly the women
who buy them.

544
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,588
You don't mean that,
Irene Molloy.

545
00:37:52,656 --> 00:37:54,351
Yes, I do, Minnie.
All lady milliners

546
00:37:54,424 --> 00:37:56,358
are suspected
of being wicked women.

547
00:37:56,426 --> 00:37:57,393
Wicked women?

548
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,553
Those dowagers
come in the shop

549
00:37:59,629 --> 00:38:00,561
merely to stare
at me.

550
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,858
Ooh. How dare they?

551
00:38:01,932 --> 00:38:03,399
If they were certain
I was a wicked woman,

552
00:38:03,466 --> 00:38:04,933
they wouldn't set foot
in the shop.

553
00:38:05,001 --> 00:38:06,764
Good riddance.
Who needs them?

554
00:38:06,837 --> 00:38:09,533
<i>We</i> do,
unfortunately.

555
00:38:09,606 --> 00:38:11,335
So do I go out
to restaurants?

556
00:38:11,408 --> 00:38:13,000
No. It would be bad
for business.

557
00:38:13,076 --> 00:38:15,067
Do I go to balls
or theaters

558
00:38:15,145 --> 00:38:16,043
or operas?

559
00:38:16,112 --> 00:38:18,979
No. It would be
bad for business.

560
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:20,880
The only men
I ever get to meet

561
00:38:20,951 --> 00:38:23,146
are the merchants who come
to sell me things.

562
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:27,156
I'm sick and tired of being
suspected of being wicked

563
00:38:27,224 --> 00:38:28,851
with nothing
to show for it.

564
00:38:28,925 --> 00:38:30,358
Oh-ho! Miss Molloy!

565
00:38:30,427 --> 00:38:31,860
Why does everybody
have adventures but me?

566
00:38:31,928 --> 00:38:33,156
Adventures?

567
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,857
I have no spirit,
that's why.

568
00:38:34,931 --> 00:38:36,125
No gumption.

569
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:38,167
Either I marry
Horace Vandergelder,

570
00:38:38,235 --> 00:38:39,862
or I'm gonna burn
this shop down

571
00:38:39,936 --> 00:38:41,870
and break out
like a fire engine

572
00:38:41,938 --> 00:38:44,168
and find myself
some excitement.

573
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:46,175
The things you're
saying today!

574
00:38:46,243 --> 00:38:48,211
I think they're
just awful.

575
00:38:48,278 --> 00:38:49,677
Oh, aren't they, though?

576
00:38:49,746 --> 00:38:52,214
And I'm enjoying
every word of it.

577
00:38:52,282 --> 00:38:53,681
What's this?

578
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,718
Another return
from Miss Mortimer.

579
00:38:55,785 --> 00:38:57,719
She wants cherries
and feathers--

580
00:38:57,787 --> 00:38:59,550
To catch a beau,
I suppose.

581
00:38:59,623 --> 00:39:00,885
If you asked me,

582
00:39:00,957 --> 00:39:02,982
she'd do better
with a heavy veil.

583
00:39:03,059 --> 00:39:04,151
[Giggles]

584
00:39:04,227 --> 00:39:06,127
Well, I told her ribbons
down the back

585
00:39:06,196 --> 00:39:07,993
is the thing to catch
a gentleman's eye.

586
00:39:08,064 --> 00:39:10,157
But she'd have
none of it.

587
00:39:10,233 --> 00:39:12,827
Minnie, make another hat
for Miss Mortimer.

588
00:39:12,903 --> 00:39:15,167
I'm wearing
this one myself.

589
00:39:15,238 --> 00:39:17,172
Oh, but you can't.

590
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,639
Why not?

591
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:20,141
Because it's--
it's provocative,

592
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:21,507
that's why not.

593
00:39:21,578 --> 00:39:24,138
Well, who knows
that provocative

594
00:39:24,214 --> 00:39:28,082
isn't just what
I want to be today?

595
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,635
Miss Molloy,

596
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:49,040
you don't love
Horace Vandergelder.

597
00:41:49,111 --> 00:41:51,705
Of course
I don't love him.

598
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,748
Then how can you--
I mean--

599
00:41:53,815 --> 00:41:56,716
Look. There are 2 men
staring at the shop.

600
00:41:56,785 --> 00:41:57,683
Minnie: Men?

601
00:41:57,753 --> 00:41:58,720
Uh-huh.

602
00:41:58,787 --> 00:42:00,186
Aren't they delicious?

603
00:42:00,255 --> 00:42:01,882
Minnie:
You don't think--

604
00:42:01,957 --> 00:42:04,152
Yes, I do believe
they mean to come in here.

605
00:42:04,226 --> 00:42:05,853
Men in the shop!
What will we do?

606
00:42:05,927 --> 00:42:07,622
Do? Why flirt with them,
of course.

607
00:42:07,696 --> 00:42:09,323
I'll give you
the short one.

608
00:42:09,398 --> 00:42:10,831
Ooh, Miss Molloy,
you're terrible!

609
00:42:10,899 --> 00:42:12,833
We'll heat them up,
then drop them cold.

610
00:42:12,901 --> 00:42:14,630
It'll be good practice
for married life.

611
00:42:14,703 --> 00:42:17,001
You say vamp,
I'll scream.

612
00:42:17,072 --> 00:42:18,004
Vamp.

613
00:42:18,073 --> 00:42:19,335
Aaah!

614
00:42:21,243 --> 00:42:24,303
I must say I like
the tall one.

615
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,312
Adventure, Barnaby.

616
00:42:26,381 --> 00:42:27,814
We can still
catch the train

617
00:42:27,883 --> 00:42:29,578
back to Yonkers.

618
00:42:29,651 --> 00:42:31,118
Oh, I feel dizzy.

619
00:42:31,186 --> 00:42:33,211
Or go see
the stuffed whale

620
00:42:33,288 --> 00:42:34,619
at the museum.

621
00:42:34,689 --> 00:42:36,156
Women, Barnaby.

622
00:42:36,224 --> 00:42:39,159
Stuffed...

623
00:42:39,227 --> 00:42:40,956
women.

624
00:42:46,535 --> 00:42:49,629
There's no one here.
We can leave.

625
00:42:49,704 --> 00:42:52,400
I'd never forgive
myself.

626
00:42:52,474 --> 00:42:54,203
Hah!

627
00:42:55,944 --> 00:42:57,571
Are you sure
this is an adventure?

628
00:42:57,646 --> 00:42:59,045
You don't have
to ask, Barnaby.

629
00:42:59,114 --> 00:43:01,139
When you're in one,
you'll know it.

630
00:43:01,216 --> 00:43:04,083
How much money
have we got left?

631
00:43:04,152 --> 00:43:06,586
Enough for the train,
dinner, and the whale.

632
00:43:06,655 --> 00:43:08,088
When they come out,

633
00:43:08,156 --> 00:43:09,589
we'll pretend
we're rich.

634
00:43:09,658 --> 00:43:11,853
We won't have to
spend anything.

635
00:43:11,927 --> 00:43:14,327
Why don't we say
Mrs. Levi sent us?

636
00:43:14,396 --> 00:43:16,864
No! We're not supposed
to ever say that!

637
00:43:16,932 --> 00:43:18,126
Shh!

638
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,636
We're 2 men-about-town
looking for hats for ladies.

639
00:43:21,703 --> 00:43:23,102
What ladies?

640
00:43:23,171 --> 00:43:24,604
Good afternoon,
ma'am.

641
00:43:24,673 --> 00:43:26,607
Wonderful weather
we're having.

642
00:43:26,675 --> 00:43:28,609
How d'you do,
ma'am?

643
00:43:28,677 --> 00:43:30,611
And how
are your hats?

644
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:32,647
Charmed to make
your acquaintance.

645
00:43:32,714 --> 00:43:34,341
Lovely place
you have here.

646
00:43:34,416 --> 00:43:36,043
Good afternoon,
gentlemen.

647
00:43:36,117 --> 00:43:39,280
[Stammers]

648
00:43:39,354 --> 00:43:40,821
Cornelius Hackl
here.

649
00:43:40,889 --> 00:43:43,380
Barnaby Tucker here.

650
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:45,892
Irene Molloy here.

651
00:43:45,961 --> 00:43:49,260
I'm very happy
to meet you.

652
00:43:50,365 --> 00:43:52,162
Is there anything
I can do for you?

653
00:43:55,604 --> 00:43:56,764
Ooh!

654
00:43:56,838 --> 00:43:58,237
Well, you see,

655
00:43:58,306 --> 00:43:59,739
we're 2
ladies-about-town

656
00:43:59,808 --> 00:44:01,742
lookin' for hats
to Molloy--

657
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:03,744
We're hats,
and we wondered

658
00:44:03,812 --> 00:44:06,713
if we could buy a lady
or 2 to Molloy with--

659
00:44:06,781 --> 00:44:08,681
We want a hat.

660
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:10,684
Well, for a lady,
of course.

661
00:44:10,752 --> 00:44:13,516
Everyone said to go
to Miss Molloy's

662
00:44:13,588 --> 00:44:16,284
'cause she's
so pretty--

663
00:44:16,358 --> 00:44:19,691
I mean, her hats
are so pretty.

664
00:44:19,761 --> 00:44:21,285
And what sort of hat

665
00:44:21,363 --> 00:44:24,389
would Mrs. Hackl
be liking?

666
00:44:24,466 --> 00:44:26,696
Oh, no,
Miss Molloy,

667
00:44:26,768 --> 00:44:28,702
there is
no Mrs. Hackl.

668
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:30,670
Yes, there is.
Your mother.

669
00:44:30,739 --> 00:44:33,173
She didn't mean that,

670
00:44:33,241 --> 00:44:34,765
did you, Miss Molloy?

671
00:44:34,843 --> 00:44:38,176
Now, this lady friend
of yours,

672
00:44:38,246 --> 00:44:39,713
couldn't she come in
with you some day

673
00:44:39,781 --> 00:44:41,146
and choose the hat
herself?

674
00:44:41,216 --> 00:44:42,183
Impossible.

675
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:44,684
There is no
lady friend.

676
00:44:44,753 --> 00:44:46,380
I thought you said

677
00:44:46,454 --> 00:44:48,718
you were here
to choose--

678
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:50,280
I mean
she's Barnaby's.

679
00:44:50,358 --> 00:44:52,690
Huh? What?

680
00:44:52,761 --> 00:44:55,195
Yes, but she lives
in Yonkers.

681
00:44:55,263 --> 00:44:57,697
She said to pick out
something

682
00:44:57,766 --> 00:44:59,199
under a dollar.

683
00:44:59,267 --> 00:45:00,734
Don't be silly,
Barnaby.

684
00:45:00,802 --> 00:45:02,201
Money's no object with us.
None at all.

685
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:03,703
[Minnie Coughing]

686
00:45:03,772 --> 00:45:05,967
Oh, my assistant--
Miss Minnie Fay.

687
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:08,475
Mr. Hackl,
Mr. Tucker.

688
00:45:08,543 --> 00:45:10,101
Good afternoon, ma'am.

689
00:45:10,178 --> 00:45:11,645
Afternoon, ma'am.

690
00:45:11,713 --> 00:45:14,238
[Giggling]

691
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:18,346
Excuse me, Mr. Tucker,

692
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,752
did you say Yonkers?

693
00:45:20,822 --> 00:45:22,551
Yes, ma'am.
We're from Yonkers.

694
00:45:22,624 --> 00:45:26,082
Well, <i>are</i> you?

695
00:45:26,161 --> 00:45:27,287
Yes.

696
00:45:27,362 --> 00:45:29,262
And forgive me
for saying this,

697
00:45:29,331 --> 00:45:32,266
but you should see
Yonkers, Miss Molloy.

698
00:45:32,334 --> 00:45:34,768
I mean, perhaps you and
your gentleman friend

699
00:45:34,836 --> 00:45:38,272
here in New York
might like to see it.

700
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,365
It's the most beautiful
town in the world--

701
00:45:40,442 --> 00:45:41,807
That's what they say.

702
00:45:41,876 --> 00:45:44,367
So I've heard,

703
00:45:44,446 --> 00:45:46,914
but I'm afraid I don't have
a gentleman friend here.

704
00:45:46,982 --> 00:45:48,040
You don't?

705
00:45:48,116 --> 00:45:50,277
Barnaby, she doesn't
have a gentleman friend.

706
00:45:50,352 --> 00:45:51,319
Ha ha ha!

707
00:45:51,386 --> 00:45:53,286
Hey, that's too bad.

708
00:45:53,355 --> 00:45:56,290
If you should happen
to have a Sunday free--

709
00:45:56,358 --> 00:45:58,326
You're Catholic,
aren't you?

710
00:45:58,393 --> 00:46:00,293
Don't worry.
I'm willing to change.

711
00:46:00,362 --> 00:46:03,297
If you're free
in the near future,

712
00:46:03,365 --> 00:46:05,333
I'd, well...we'd...

713
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,733
like to show you Yonkers
from top to bottom.

714
00:46:08,803 --> 00:46:10,293
It's very historic.

715
00:46:10,372 --> 00:46:11,532
As a matter of fact,

716
00:46:11,606 --> 00:46:13,267
I might be there
sooner than you think.

717
00:46:13,341 --> 00:46:14,740
This Sunday?

718
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:16,800
You see, I have a friend
who lives in Yonkers.

719
00:46:16,878 --> 00:46:18,903
Perhaps you know him.

720
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,777
I do?

721
00:46:20,849 --> 00:46:23,579
Oh, it's always so foolish
to ask in cases like that,

722
00:46:23,652 --> 00:46:24,778
isn't it?

723
00:46:24,853 --> 00:46:26,377
Why should you know him?

724
00:46:26,454 --> 00:46:27,751
It's a Mr. Vandergelder?

725
00:46:27,822 --> 00:46:29,289
Mr. Vandergelder, oh!

726
00:46:29,357 --> 00:46:30,756
Horace Vandergelder?

727
00:46:30,825 --> 00:46:32,725
Of Vandergelder's
Hay and Feed?

728
00:46:32,794 --> 00:46:34,557
Yes, do you know him?

729
00:46:34,629 --> 00:46:36,358
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!

730
00:46:36,431 --> 00:46:37,363
- No!
- No!

731
00:46:37,432 --> 00:46:38,399
- No, no!
- No, no!

732
00:46:38,466 --> 00:46:39,626
Mr. Vandergelder's

733
00:46:39,701 --> 00:46:42,135
coming to see me
this afternoon.

734
00:46:42,203 --> 00:46:43,261
Coming here?

735
00:46:43,338 --> 00:46:44,396
This afternoon?

736
00:46:44,472 --> 00:46:46,497
Cornelius!
Cornelius, look!

737
00:46:47,842 --> 00:46:49,833
It's wolf-trap!

738
00:46:49,911 --> 00:46:51,003
Look out!

739
00:46:52,881 --> 00:46:54,781
Beggin' your pardon,
Miss Molloy.

740
00:46:54,849 --> 00:46:56,373
Gentlemen,
what are you doing?

741
00:46:56,451 --> 00:46:58,146
We'll explain later.
Just help us!

742
00:46:58,219 --> 00:46:59,516
Come out of there
this minute!

743
00:46:59,587 --> 00:47:01,714
We're innocent as can be,
Miss Molloy.

744
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:04,725
I insist that
you both come out,

745
00:47:04,793 --> 00:47:06,727
or I'll be forced--

746
00:47:06,795 --> 00:47:09,229
Mr. Vandergelder,
how nice to see you.

747
00:47:09,297 --> 00:47:10,847
And Dolly Levi.
What a surprise.

748
00:47:10,981 --> 00:47:12,846
Irene, my darling,
how well you look.

749
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:14,850
You must be in love.

750
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:16,579
Afternoon,
Miss Molloy.

751
00:47:16,653 --> 00:47:19,383
What a pleasure to have you
in New York.

752
00:47:19,456 --> 00:47:22,584
Yes. Yonkers lies up there
decimated today.

753
00:47:22,659 --> 00:47:25,822
We thought we'd pay you
a visit, Irene,

754
00:47:25,895 --> 00:47:27,726
unless it's inconvenient.

755
00:47:27,797 --> 00:47:29,594
Inconvenient?

756
00:47:29,666 --> 00:47:32,191
Whatever gave you
that idea?

757
00:47:32,268 --> 00:47:33,599
Mr. Vandergelder thought

758
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:35,604
he saw 2 customers
in the shop--

759
00:47:35,672 --> 00:47:36,934
2, uh, men.

760
00:47:37,007 --> 00:47:38,167
Men!

761
00:47:38,241 --> 00:47:39,674
Oh ho ho.

762
00:47:39,743 --> 00:47:41,677
In a ladies'
hat shop?

763
00:47:41,745 --> 00:47:43,178
Ha ha ha!

764
00:47:43,246 --> 00:47:44,873
Come on, let's go
into my workroom.

765
00:47:44,948 --> 00:47:46,313
I'm so eager for you
to see it.

766
00:47:46,383 --> 00:47:48,783
I've already
seen it twice.

767
00:47:48,852 --> 00:47:50,376
But I need
your advice.

768
00:47:50,453 --> 00:47:52,011
Advice
from Mr. Vandergelder.

769
00:47:52,088 --> 00:47:54,215
The whole city should
hear this and grow rich.

770
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:56,349
Advice is cheap,
Miss Molloy.

771
00:47:56,426 --> 00:47:57,859
It's the things that come
gift-wrapped that count.

772
00:47:57,927 --> 00:48:00,191
I have never heard it
put more beautifully.

773
00:48:00,263 --> 00:48:02,197
Thank you,
Mr. Vandergelder.

774
00:48:02,265 --> 00:48:04,130
Chocolate-covered
peanuts, unshelled.

775
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,168
They're
the expensive kind.

776
00:48:06,236 --> 00:48:09,171
Why don't we open them
in the workroom?

777
00:48:09,239 --> 00:48:10,297
Miss Molloy,

778
00:48:10,373 --> 00:48:13,501
I have important business
to discuss with you

779
00:48:13,576 --> 00:48:17,637
as soon as Mrs. Levi
says good-bye.

780
00:48:17,714 --> 00:48:19,341
Pay no attention to me.

781
00:48:19,416 --> 00:48:21,316
I'm just browsing.

782
00:48:21,384 --> 00:48:22,646
Business,
Mr. Vandergelder?

783
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:23,777
Hay and feed?

784
00:48:23,853 --> 00:48:24,979
Well, not exactly.

785
00:48:25,055 --> 00:48:26,647
A new hat shop
in Yonkers?

786
00:48:26,723 --> 00:48:28,987
I hear it's a very
beautiful city,

787
00:48:29,059 --> 00:48:30,253
and quite historic
according--

788
00:48:31,895 --> 00:48:33,988
Yes, go on.

789
00:48:34,064 --> 00:48:37,659
Who's been telling you
about Yonkers, may I ask?

790
00:48:37,734 --> 00:48:39,201
Oh, nobody.
A friend.

791
00:48:39,269 --> 00:48:40,827
What friend?

792
00:48:42,105 --> 00:48:44,266
Well, you see,
he--

793
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,534
He?

794
00:48:45,608 --> 00:48:49,066
Yes, uh...he--

795
00:48:49,145 --> 00:48:50,510
His name,
Miss Molloy.

796
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:51,672
What?

797
00:48:51,748 --> 00:48:53,215
His name.

798
00:48:53,283 --> 00:48:56,480
Oh, I believe it was--
is Mr. Cornelius Hackl

799
00:48:56,553 --> 00:48:59,147
of Yonkers.

800
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:01,318
Cornelius Hackl?

801
00:49:01,391 --> 00:49:03,188
Yes.
Do you know him?

802
00:49:03,259 --> 00:49:05,159
He's my head clerk.

803
00:49:05,228 --> 00:49:06,286
He is?

804
00:49:06,362 --> 00:49:07,989
He's been in my store
for 1 0 years.

805
00:49:08,064 --> 00:49:09,793
Where would
you have known him?

806
00:49:09,866 --> 00:49:10,992
Just one of those
chance meetings,

807
00:49:11,067 --> 00:49:12,125
I suppose.

808
00:49:12,202 --> 00:49:14,670
Yes, one of those
chance meetings.

809
00:49:14,737 --> 00:49:15,795
Chance meetings?

810
00:49:15,872 --> 00:49:17,897
Cornelius has no right
to chance meetings!

811
00:49:17,974 --> 00:49:20,033
Where was it?

812
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:21,543
Really!
It's unlike you

813
00:49:21,611 --> 00:49:22,873
to question me
in such a way.

814
00:49:22,946 --> 00:49:24,880
The truth
might as well

815
00:49:24,948 --> 00:49:26,142
come out now.

816
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:27,649
Your head clerk

817
00:49:27,717 --> 00:49:29,309
is better known
than you think.

818
00:49:29,385 --> 00:49:30,317
Nonsense.

819
00:49:30,386 --> 00:49:32,650
He's in New York
all the time.

820
00:49:32,722 --> 00:49:34,019
Everybody knows
Cornelius Hackl.

821
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:36,684
He never comes
to New York.

822
00:49:36,759 --> 00:49:39,057
He works all day
in my store.

823
00:49:39,129 --> 00:49:40,460
So you think,
but it's not true.

824
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:42,794
Dolly Levi,
you are mistaken!

825
00:49:42,866 --> 00:49:43,992
Horace Vandergelder,

826
00:49:44,067 --> 00:49:46,035
you keep your nose so deep
in account books,

827
00:49:46,102 --> 00:49:49,333
you don't even
know what goes on.

828
00:49:49,405 --> 00:49:51,999
By day, he's your faithful,
trusted clerk.

829
00:49:52,075 --> 00:49:55,841
But by night, oh, by night,
he leads a double life.

830
00:49:55,912 --> 00:49:57,846
Why he's, why he's here--

831
00:49:57,914 --> 00:49:59,848
Umm...at the opera,

832
00:49:59,916 --> 00:50:02,680
at the great restaurants,
the fashionable homes.

833
00:50:02,752 --> 00:50:04,879
He's even at the Harmonia
Gardens restaurant

834
00:50:04,954 --> 00:50:06,387
2, 3 times a week.

835
00:50:06,456 --> 00:50:07,855
The fact is,

836
00:50:07,924 --> 00:50:09,858
he is the wittiest,
gayest, naughtiest,

837
00:50:09,926 --> 00:50:12,827
most delightful man
in New York City.

838
00:50:12,896 --> 00:50:16,593
He's just <i>the</i>--
<i>the</i> famous Cornelius Hackl!

839
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:18,361
It ain't
the same man.

840
00:50:18,434 --> 00:50:20,925
If I thought Cornelius
came to New York,

841
00:50:21,004 --> 00:50:22,096
I'd discharge him!

842
00:50:22,172 --> 00:50:24,037
Who took the horses off
ofJenny Lind's carriage

843
00:50:24,107 --> 00:50:25,870
and pulled them
through the streets?

844
00:50:25,942 --> 00:50:26,931
- Who?
- Cornelius Hackl!

845
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:28,875
Who dressed up as a waiter
at the Fifth Avenue Hotel

846
00:50:29,345 --> 00:50:30,869
and took an oyster
and dropped it right down--

847
00:50:30,947 --> 00:50:32,380
No, it's too wicked.
I can't say it.

848
00:50:32,448 --> 00:50:33,938
Say it!

849
00:50:34,017 --> 00:50:35,450
No, but it was
Cornelius Hackl.

850
00:50:35,518 --> 00:50:37,884
It ain't the same man!
Where'd he get the money?

851
00:50:37,954 --> 00:50:40,388
Oh, he's very rich.

852
00:50:40,456 --> 00:50:42,515
Rich?! I keep his money
in my own safe.

853
00:50:42,592 --> 00:50:43,752
He has $1 45.36!

854
00:50:43,826 --> 00:50:46,886
Oh, Mr. Vandergelder,
you are killing me.

855
00:50:46,963 --> 00:50:48,931
He's one
of <i>the</i> Hackls.

856
00:50:48,998 --> 00:50:50,590
They built
the Raritan Canal.

857
00:50:50,667 --> 00:50:52,430
Then why would he work
in my store?

858
00:50:52,502 --> 00:50:53,560
I don't wanna hear it.

859
00:50:53,636 --> 00:50:55,069
I'm going home.
I have a headache.

860
00:50:55,138 --> 00:50:57,072
It ain't the same man.
You can't escape facts.

861
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:58,402
I just made him
chief clerk!

862
00:50:58,474 --> 00:51:00,374
If you had any sense,
you'd make him a partner.

863
00:51:00,443 --> 00:51:02,070
Irene, I can see
you're as taken with him

864
00:51:02,145 --> 00:51:03,407
as everybody else is.

865
00:51:03,479 --> 00:51:05,379
But I only met him
once.

866
00:51:05,448 --> 00:51:07,939
Now, don't be thinking
of marrying him.

867
00:51:08,017 --> 00:51:10,417
Dolly, what are
you saying?

868
00:51:10,486 --> 00:51:12,249
Careful. He breaks hearts
like hickory nuts.

869
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:13,254
Horace: Who?

870
00:51:13,323 --> 00:51:14,255
Cornelius Hackl.

871
00:51:14,324 --> 00:51:15,348
Miss Molloy,

872
00:51:15,425 --> 00:51:17,359
how long has he been
calling on you?

873
00:51:17,427 --> 00:51:18,860
Mr. Vandergelder,
suppose I told you

874
00:51:18,928 --> 00:51:21,396
he has not been
calling on me?

875
00:51:21,464 --> 00:51:23,295
Excuse me.

876
00:51:23,366 --> 00:51:25,527
Not now, Minnie!

877
00:51:31,941 --> 00:51:32,873
Aaah!

878
00:51:32,942 --> 00:51:34,034
Stop singing,
Minnie!

879
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:35,543
There's a man
in there!

880
00:51:35,612 --> 00:51:36,579
That's not amusing,
Minnie.

881
00:51:36,646 --> 00:51:37,544
But there's a man!

882
00:51:37,614 --> 00:51:39,582
We don't wish
to be interrupted.

883
00:51:39,649 --> 00:51:40,911
Go back immediately.

884
00:51:40,984 --> 00:51:43,919
The poor dear is tired
from overwork.

885
00:51:43,987 --> 00:51:46,979
If there's a man in there,
we'll get him out!

886
00:51:47,056 --> 00:51:48,921
Whoever you are,
come on out!

887
00:51:48,992 --> 00:51:50,721
Do you realize
what you're saying?

888
00:51:50,793 --> 00:51:51,725
I certainly do!

889
00:51:51,794 --> 00:51:53,728
Before you move
or say another word

890
00:51:53,796 --> 00:51:57,789
that you might
regret, allow me.

891
00:51:57,867 --> 00:51:58,765
Dolly!

892
00:51:58,835 --> 00:52:00,564
Stand back.

893
00:52:06,509 --> 00:52:07,999
There. You see?

894
00:52:08,077 --> 00:52:09,874
So much
for this nonsense

895
00:52:09,946 --> 00:52:11,470
about that
darling girl

896
00:52:11,547 --> 00:52:14,277
hiding a man
in the closet.

897
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:15,840
We'll forget
you ever said it.

898
00:52:15,918 --> 00:52:16,885
It's forgotten.

899
00:52:16,953 --> 00:52:18,386
Ah-choo!

900
00:52:18,454 --> 00:52:20,046
Because there's
nobody in there.

901
00:52:20,123 --> 00:52:21,055
Ah-choo!

902
00:52:21,124 --> 00:52:23,456
God bless you.

903
00:52:32,969 --> 00:52:34,163
Miss Molloy?

904
00:52:34,237 --> 00:52:38,003
Yes, Mr. Vandergelder,
there is a man in there.

905
00:52:38,074 --> 00:52:40,167
I see.

906
00:52:40,243 --> 00:52:43,076
There also happens
to be an explanation,

907
00:52:43,146 --> 00:52:44,579
but for the present

908
00:52:44,647 --> 00:52:47,616
I should just say
good afternoon.

909
00:52:47,684 --> 00:52:49,345
Ah-choo!

910
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:52,149
Ah-choo!

911
00:52:53,156 --> 00:52:54,714
Another?

912
00:52:55,658 --> 00:52:57,182
Another.

913
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:58,158
Good Lord,

914
00:52:58,227 --> 00:53:00,320
the whole room
is crawling with men.

915
00:53:00,396 --> 00:53:01,863
Irene, darling,
congratulations.

916
00:53:01,931 --> 00:53:05,264
Miss Molloy,
I shan't trouble you again.

917
00:53:05,335 --> 00:53:08,336
And I hope, vice versa.

918
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,205
Horace, where
are you going?

919
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:15,242
To march in
the 1 4th Street parade

920
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:17,505
with the kind of people
I can trust--

921
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:19,911
7 00 men.

922
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:26,412
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

923
00:53:39,601 --> 00:53:40,761
Now.

924
00:53:40,835 --> 00:53:42,769
I demand
an explanation!

925
00:53:42,837 --> 00:53:44,771
Have you met
Minnie Fay?

926
00:53:44,839 --> 00:53:47,000
Leave, or I'll call
for Officer Gogarty!

927
00:53:47,075 --> 00:53:49,043
There's no fun
in a jailhouse.

928
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:50,008
Jail?!

929
00:53:50,078 --> 00:53:51,010
Jail!

930
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:52,842
Everybody,
don't talk at once!

931
00:53:52,914 --> 00:53:54,040
Just because you're
rich and famous...

932
00:53:54,115 --> 00:53:55,047
Rich and famous?

933
00:53:55,116 --> 00:53:56,048
Don't deny it.

934
00:53:56,117 --> 00:53:57,015
Doesn't mean

935
00:53:57,085 --> 00:53:58,552
you won't make up
for this trouble.

936
00:53:58,620 --> 00:53:59,552
We'll do anything.

937
00:53:59,621 --> 00:54:00,553
Irene,
Cornelius Hackl.

938
00:54:00,622 --> 00:54:01,782
We've already met.

939
00:54:01,856 --> 00:54:03,118
Jail is
absolutely out.

940
00:54:03,191 --> 00:54:04,988
Cornelius,
explain to her.

941
00:54:05,059 --> 00:54:06,219
I'm Cornelius Hackl.

942
00:54:06,294 --> 00:54:07,727
Minnie Fay.

943
00:54:07,795 --> 00:54:10,764
The only way
to make up for it--

944
00:54:10,832 --> 00:54:12,231
Yes, of course--

945
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:14,461
You can have them
both put away for years

946
00:54:14,536 --> 00:54:16,231
on this charge.
Help, police, help.

947
00:54:16,304 --> 00:54:18,238
Only have dinner
with them first

948
00:54:18,306 --> 00:54:20,740
to show that you tried
to settle amicably.

949
00:54:20,808 --> 00:54:22,503
Dinner first, life
imprisonment later.

950
00:54:22,577 --> 00:54:23,976
It's a lovely day.

951
00:54:24,045 --> 00:54:25,512
It's gonna be
a lovelier evening.

952
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:27,013
Something could happen

953
00:54:27,081 --> 00:54:28,981
before you send them
to jail.

954
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:30,483
Oh, by all means.

955
00:54:30,552 --> 00:54:32,782
It's what Barnaby
and I had in mind.

956
00:54:32,854 --> 00:54:34,515
Minnie, we've been
respectable for years.

957
00:54:34,589 --> 00:54:36,022
Now we're in disgrace.

958
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:38,490
We might as well
make the most of it.

959
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,050
We'd be delighted
to accept.

960
00:54:40,128 --> 00:54:42,028
It's the only sensible
thing to do.

961
00:54:42,096 --> 00:54:42,994
Cornelius!

962
00:54:43,064 --> 00:54:44,929
Now, I know
a doughnut shop--

963
00:54:44,999 --> 00:54:46,990
Doughnut shop!
Certainly not!

964
00:54:47,068 --> 00:54:49,798
We want a fine dinner
in the fashionable world.

965
00:54:49,871 --> 00:54:52,499
And I know
just the place--

966
00:54:52,574 --> 00:54:54,769
The Harmonia Gardens
on 1 4th Street.

967
00:54:54,842 --> 00:54:56,309
Harmonia Gardens!

968
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:57,776
But wait a minute.

969
00:54:57,845 --> 00:54:59,836
The finest food
that money can buy,

970
00:54:59,914 --> 00:55:01,779
and a lovely orchestra.
A polka contest tonight.

971
00:55:01,849 --> 00:55:03,339
Dancing!

972
00:55:03,418 --> 00:55:05,215
Just ask
for Rudolph.

973
00:55:05,286 --> 00:55:07,516
Oh, we could never
go there.

974
00:55:07,589 --> 00:55:09,716
It sounds marvelous!
Come, Minnie.

975
00:55:09,791 --> 00:55:11,258
We'll close the shop,

976
00:55:11,326 --> 00:55:13,123
and take the whole
afternoon off.

977
00:55:13,194 --> 00:55:15,754
Oh, I mean,
we could never.

978
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:16,888
Don't misunderstand.

979
00:55:16,965 --> 00:55:18,728
It isn't money,
or anything.

980
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,933
It's the...the...

981
00:55:22,067 --> 00:55:23,557
What, Mr. Hackl?

982
00:55:23,635 --> 00:55:24,932
It's the dancing.

983
00:55:25,003 --> 00:55:26,402
You see, I don't know how,

984
00:55:26,471 --> 00:55:28,268
and they have contests
and things like that

985
00:55:28,339 --> 00:55:30,239
at Harmonia
Whatever-it-is.

986
00:55:30,308 --> 00:55:32,071
You said so
yourself.

987
00:55:32,143 --> 00:55:33,542
It would take me
weeks, months,

988
00:55:33,611 --> 00:55:35,772
years to learn.

989
00:55:35,847 --> 00:55:37,815
''Mrs. Dolly Levi.

990
00:55:37,882 --> 00:55:39,941
''28 3/ 4 year-old
chief clerks

991
00:55:40,018 --> 00:55:41,246
taught how to--''

992
00:55:41,319 --> 00:55:43,514
Now, you just put
one arm here

993
00:55:43,588 --> 00:55:44,850
and one arm there.

994
00:55:44,923 --> 00:55:46,254
It's no use.

995
00:55:46,324 --> 00:55:47,723
I have absolutely
no sense of rhythm.

996
00:55:47,792 --> 00:55:49,487
Absolutely no sense
of rhythm

997
00:55:49,561 --> 00:55:51,153
is one of the primary
requirements

998
00:55:51,229 --> 00:55:53,220
for learning
by the Levi method.

999
00:55:53,298 --> 00:55:55,266
Just give me 5 minutes
of your time, Mr. Hackl.

1000
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:56,766
I'll have you dancing
in the streets.

1001
00:55:56,835 --> 00:56:00,100
I think we'll start
with lesson 7.

1002
00:56:00,171 --> 00:56:01,968
Right foot, touch,
left foot, touch,

1003
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,473
under, back around,
touch.

1004
00:56:03,541 --> 00:56:05,372
Back through around,
out, over, release,

1005
00:56:05,443 --> 00:56:07,468
unfurl, oh, oh.

1006
00:56:07,545 --> 00:56:10,241
That's wonderful,
Mr. Hackl.

1007
00:56:10,315 --> 00:56:11,805
When I think
of the lucky women

1008
00:56:11,883 --> 00:56:13,714
who'll find heaven
in your arms--

1009
00:56:13,785 --> 00:56:15,582
I think we'll go
back to lesson one,

1010
00:56:15,653 --> 00:56:17,644
shall we?

1011
00:56:17,722 --> 00:56:20,782
Put your hand
on her waist

1012
00:56:20,859 --> 00:56:23,123
and stand...

1013
00:56:23,194 --> 00:56:25,094
with her right

1014
00:56:25,163 --> 00:56:27,028
in your left...

1015
00:56:27,098 --> 00:56:28,531
hand.

1016
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,535
And...

1017
00:56:31,603 --> 00:56:33,503
1 ...

1018
00:56:33,571 --> 00:56:35,505
That's right.

1019
00:56:35,573 --> 00:56:37,507
And 1 , 2,

1020
00:56:37,575 --> 00:56:39,509
3...ah!

1021
00:56:39,577 --> 00:56:41,545
Ah.

1022
00:56:41,613 --> 00:56:44,776
1 ...2...

1023
00:56:44,849 --> 00:56:46,544
3--Oh, no,
this one.

1024
00:56:46,618 --> 00:56:48,552
And 1 ...

1025
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:50,554
2...

1026
00:56:50,622 --> 00:56:52,556
3...

1027
00:56:52,624 --> 00:56:57,027
1 ...2...3...

1028
00:56:57,095 --> 00:56:58,562
Look!

1029
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:00,063
I'm dancing!

1030
00:57:00,131 --> 00:57:01,257
Aah...

1031
00:57:01,332 --> 00:57:02,594
I was.

1032
00:57:02,667 --> 00:57:05,067
Of course you were,
Mr. Hackl.

1033
00:57:25,089 --> 00:57:27,751
Look! I'm dancing!

1034
00:57:27,825 --> 00:57:30,225
Ah! Uh, come here.

1035
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:46,198
The word I think I'd use
is athletic.

1036
00:57:49,614 --> 00:57:50,603
Good.

1037
00:57:59,624 --> 00:58:01,091
That's wonderful.

1038
00:58:01,159 --> 00:58:02,558
Look, everybody!

1039
00:58:02,627 --> 00:58:05,095
I, Cornelius Hackl,
sport,

1040
00:58:05,163 --> 00:58:07,393
I'm dancing!

1041
00:58:08,967 --> 00:58:11,629
You're next,
Mr. Tucker.

1042
00:58:11,703 --> 00:58:13,227
Ah!

1043
00:58:25,917 --> 00:58:28,511
And everyone,
stand aside!

1044
00:58:28,586 --> 00:58:30,554
Uh, not yet,
Mr. Tucker.

1045
00:58:30,622 --> 00:58:32,021
1 -2-3, 1 -2-3

1046
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:33,182
1 -2-3, 1 ...

1047
00:58:33,258 --> 00:58:34,555
He's dancing!

1048
00:58:34,626 --> 00:58:37,459
I think he's holdin'
out on us.

1049
00:58:49,274 --> 00:58:52,243
Whatever you do, Mr. Tucker,
keep breathing.

1050
00:59:05,123 --> 00:59:07,557
Ha ha ha!

1051
00:59:07,625 --> 00:59:09,183
Oh!

1052
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:12,093
Ha ha ha!

1053
00:59:12,163 --> 00:59:14,927
Ha ha ha ha!

1054
00:59:14,999 --> 00:59:16,591
Ha ha!

1055
00:59:16,668 --> 00:59:18,636
Come on.

1056
01:04:54,283 --> 01:04:56,342
Dolly!

1057
01:04:56,419 --> 01:04:59,320
Cornelius is taking us
to see the parade.

1058
01:04:59,388 --> 01:05:01,322
Everyone
will be marching.

1059
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:03,324
Cornelius:
Come on, Mrs. Levi!

1060
01:05:03,392 --> 01:05:07,021
Oh, Dolly, the world is full
of such wonderful things.

1061
01:05:09,532 --> 01:05:12,626
Hurry, before
the parade passes by!

1062
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:15,469
Yes, I will.

1063
01:05:15,538 --> 01:05:16,937
I will.

1064
01:05:28,551 --> 01:05:31,145
Before the parade
passes by.

1065
01:07:11,821 --> 01:07:14,915
Ephraim, let me go.

1066
01:07:16,626 --> 01:07:19,094
It's been long enough,
Ephraim.

1067
01:07:21,097 --> 01:07:24,464
Every night,
just like you'd want me to,

1068
01:07:24,533 --> 01:07:26,967
I've put out the cat,

1069

But lately, Ephraim...

1074
01:07:46,989 --> 01:07:49,048
I've begun
to realize that...

1075
01:07:50,493 --> 01:07:53,394

1076
01:07:53,462 --> 01:07:56,397

Now, Horace Vandergelder,

1081
01:08:08,077 --> 01:08:10,045
he's always saying,

1082
01:08:10,112 --> 01:08:12,512
''The world
is full of fools,''

1083
01:08:12,581 --> 01:08:14,412

he's right, isn't he?

1084
01:08:14,483 --> 01:08:17,452

Irene, myself.

1086
01:08:18,988 --> 01:08:21,422
when you have got
to decide

1087

a fool among fools...

1088

1089
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:30,399
Well, I have made
that decision, Ephraim,

1090
01:08:30,466 --> 01:08:34,368
but I would feel
so much better about it if--

1091

give me a sign--

01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:46,448
We were counting
here

1248
01:20:46,517 --> 01:20:48,883
while we were
waiting.

1249
01:20:48,952 --> 01:20:50,476
I hear all rich people

1250
01:20:50,554 --> 01:20:52,317
do nothing
but count their money.

1251
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:54,448
I'm so hungry.
Why don't we go in

1252
01:20:54,525 --> 01:20:56,959
and have some
hors d'oeuvres first?

1253
01:20:57,027 --> 01:20:57,994
No, no, no!

1254
01:20:58,062 --> 01:20:59,324
It's very fashionable.

1255
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:00,829
It would spoil
our appetites.

1256
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:01,990
Or we could have
an aperitif.

1257
01:21:02,066 --> 01:21:03,465
It's out
of the question.

1258
01:21:03,534 --> 01:21:05,297
Barnaby and I
don't agree

1259
01:21:05,369 --> 01:21:07,337
with that sort
of thing.

1260
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:08,962
But all those people do.

1261
01:21:09,039 --> 01:21:12,304
Well, they simply
don't know that, um...

1262
01:21:12,376 --> 01:21:14,810
aperitif is no longer
considered elegant.

1263
01:21:14,878 --> 01:21:17,039
Oh, it isn't?

1264
01:21:17,114 --> 01:21:18,979

for years.

1265
01:21:19,049 --> 01:21:21,517

to Harmonia Gardens.

1268
01:21:24,588 --> 01:21:27,523
I've always wanted
to ride in a hack.

1269

There's one.
Yoo-hoo!

1270
01:21:29,059 --> 01:21:31,755
No, no! We can't do that!

1271
01:21:31,829 --> 01:21:34,764
I mean, it isn't the money
or anything.

1272

It's just that...
nowadays,

1273
01:21:37,701 --> 01:21:40,261

never take hacks.

and dig for some.

1425
01:37:43,464 --> 01:37:44,658
Oh!

1426
01:37:45,633 --> 01:37:46,622

Oh.

[Squealing

1431
01:39:50,624 --> 01:39:51,591
Hello, again.

1432
01:39:51,658 --> 01:39:52,989
Here we are.

1433
01:39:53,060 --> 01:39:54,527
We thought
something happened.

1434
01:39:54,595 --> 01:39:56,153
Don't worry,
it will.

1435
01:40:55,055 --> 01:40:56,647
[Applause And Cheering]

1436
01:40:59,493 --> 01:41:01,085
Barnaby...

1437
01:41:01,161 --> 01:41:03,220
Irene, Minnie...

1438
01:41:06,133 --> 01:41:08,567
I feel so good
about everything,

1439
01:41:08,635 --> 01:41:10,569
so good about
this whole day,

1440
01:41:10,637 --> 01:41:14,004
that I am now going
to become an honest man

1441
01:41:14,074 --> 01:41:15,541
and tell the truth.

1442
01:41:15,609 --> 01:41:17,042
Cornelius?

1443
01:41:17,110 --> 01:41:19,578
I'd forgotten what
strange things

1444
01:41:19,646 --> 01:41:22,143
happen to men
when they drink.

1445
01:41:22,277 --> 01:41:25,246
If I tell you
the truth,

1446
01:41:25,313 --> 01:41:28,714
will you let me put my arm
around your waist?

1447
01:41:28,783 --> 01:41:29,715
Good heavens,

1448
01:41:29,784 --> 01:41:32,719
you can do that even
if you lie to me.

1449
01:41:40,962 --> 01:41:44,659
Ahhhh!

1450
01:41:44,732 --> 01:41:47,166
I've never touched
a woman before.

1451
01:41:47,235 --> 01:41:50,602
You still haven't.
That's my corset.

1452
01:41:53,274 --> 01:41:55,208
You're a wonderful
person, Irene.

1453
01:41:55,276 --> 01:41:56,709
Thank you,
Cornelius.

1454
01:41:56,778 --> 01:41:58,473
And that's why

1455
01:41:58,546 --> 01:42:00,446
I have to tell
you the truth.

1456
01:42:00,515 --> 01:42:03,211
If it'll make you
feel better.

1457
01:42:03,284 --> 01:42:04,683
It's all those
fancy things

1458
01:42:04,752 --> 01:42:06,720
that Mrs. Levi
said about me--

1459
01:42:06,788 --> 01:42:08,688
Oh, yes.

1460
01:42:08,756 --> 01:42:10,724
Well...

1461
01:42:10,792 --> 01:42:12,692
they're just not so.

1462
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:14,125
Indeed?

1463
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:18,931
Irene, I'm not rich.

1464
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,524
Not rich?

1465
01:42:20,601 --> 01:42:23,968
I'm none of the things
Mrs. Levi said I was.

1466
01:42:24,038 --> 01:42:25,699
And neither is Barnaby.

1467
01:42:25,773 --> 01:42:28,003
We're not sports.
We don't know anybody.

1468
01:42:28,076 --> 01:42:30,010
We never come to New York.

1469
01:42:30,078 --> 01:42:31,477
We never do anything

1470
01:42:31,546 --> 01:42:34,140
except work all day
and clean the store at night.

1471
01:42:34,215 --> 01:42:36,308
And we wanted so much

1472
01:42:36,384 --> 01:42:39,182
to have one day
of adventure,

1473
01:42:39,253 --> 01:42:40,914
that we ran away
from Yonkers

1474
01:42:40,988 --> 01:42:43,821
and told a lot of lies.

1475
01:42:43,891 --> 01:42:45,324
Well, look at us,

1476
01:42:45,393 --> 01:42:48,487
a pair of penniless
pretenders.

1477
01:42:48,563 --> 01:42:49,495
But, Cornelius,

1478
01:42:49,564 --> 01:42:51,293
I've known that
all along.

1479
01:42:51,366 --> 01:42:52,560
You have?

1480
01:42:52,633 --> 01:42:55,898
Why else would you two
have hidden?

1481
01:42:55,970 --> 01:42:58,029
And made us walk
all over New York?

1482
01:42:58,106 --> 01:43:01,803
You're the nicest ladies
a man ever went to jail for.

1483
01:43:01,876 --> 01:43:03,173
Jail?

1484
01:43:03,244 --> 01:43:06,372
We don't have money
for this dinner!

1485
01:43:06,447 --> 01:43:08,347
Of course you don't.

1486
01:43:08,416 --> 01:43:09,610
Minnie,

1487
01:43:09,684 --> 01:43:12,585
show these 2 sports
what I've got in my purse.

1488
01:43:12,653 --> 01:43:14,883
What a pleasure to know

1489
01:43:14,956 --> 01:43:17,390
that selling
all those silly hats

1490
01:43:17,458 --> 01:43:21,121
can pay for an evening
as delightful as this one.

1491
01:43:21,195 --> 01:43:25,393
Oh, I can't help myself!.

1492
01:43:28,703 --> 01:43:29,795
Wow!

1493
01:43:32,874 --> 01:43:36,173
Oh! I--hah!

1494
01:43:38,045 --> 01:43:40,309
No, no, Minnie,
my white handbag,

1495
01:43:40,381 --> 01:43:41,973
not that one.

1496
01:43:43,384 --> 01:43:44,851
My white handbag.

1497
01:43:44,919 --> 01:43:47,319
When we changed
for the evening.

1498
01:43:47,388 --> 01:43:48,821
Oh!

1499
01:43:48,890 --> 01:43:50,323
Minnie!

1500
01:43:50,391 --> 01:43:52,359
Only my mad money--

1501
01:43:52,427 --> 01:43:55,055
A nickel
for the horse car.

1502
01:43:57,432 --> 01:44:00,492
Would you like
your check now, sir?

1503
01:44:08,910 --> 01:44:10,605
Take this away,
my good man.

1504
01:44:10,678 --> 01:44:13,112
Bring us another bottle
of champagne.

1505
01:44:21,088 --> 01:44:23,215
What's this?
What are you doing?

1506
01:44:23,291 --> 01:44:24,883
It's 8:00,
Mr. Vandergelder.

1507
01:44:24,959 --> 01:44:26,756
I really
must be going.

1508
01:44:26,828 --> 01:44:28,125
Going?

1509
01:44:28,196 --> 01:44:30,858
You haven't finished
your dinner yet.

1510
01:44:30,932 --> 01:44:32,297
That's
expensive food.

1511
01:44:32,366 --> 01:44:34,334
If I ordered
that every night,

1512
01:44:34,402 --> 01:44:35,994
I'd be
out of business!

1513
01:44:36,070 --> 01:44:38,061
I suggest you have
the waiter put it in a bag

1514
01:44:38,139 --> 01:44:41,040
and take it home to Yonkers
to your horses and pigs.

1515
01:44:41,108 --> 01:44:43,099
I don't have pigs,
Miss Simple,

1516
01:44:43,177 --> 01:44:44,576
I have chickens.

1517
01:44:44,645 --> 01:44:47,170
I didn't get them
by being wasteful!

1518
01:44:47,248 --> 01:44:50,308
I see no point in this
trivial discussion,

1519
01:44:50,384 --> 01:44:53,080
nor in my remaining
here any longer,

1520
01:44:53,154 --> 01:44:56,612
in as much as it is
quite clear that you are--

1521
01:44:56,691 --> 01:44:58,625
If you forgive
the expression--

1522
01:44:58,693 --> 01:45:00,354
Entirely unsuitable.

[Drops Silverware]

1524
01:45:01,529 --> 01:45:02,621
Unsuitable?

1525
01:45:02,697 --> 01:45:05,860
I assure you, I'll never
say a word to Mrs. Levi

1526
01:45:05,933 --> 01:45:07,833
about this
unfortunate evening.

1527
01:45:07,902 --> 01:45:11,360
I suggest you do likewise
when she arrives here.

1528
01:45:11,439 --> 01:45:12,963
Wait a minute!

1529
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:15,565
Did you say
''Arrives here''?

1530
01:45:15,643 --> 01:45:17,668
Yes, she planned
to join us at 8:00.

1531
01:45:17,745 --> 01:45:19,679
You may tell her I left

1532
01:45:19,747 --> 01:45:21,681
because I felt sick
to my stomach.

1533
01:45:21,749 --> 01:45:23,842
It's quite true,
you know.

1534
01:45:23,918 --> 01:45:25,510
Good night.

1535
01:45:29,924 --> 01:45:32,085
Any man who goes
to a big city

1536
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:34,218
deserves
what happens to him.

1537
01:45:44,405 --> 01:45:46,100
He's all yours, honey.

1538
01:45:46,173 --> 01:45:47,572
Good. Mr. Cassidy?

1539
01:45:47,642 --> 01:45:49,075
Yes, Mrs. Levi?

1540
01:45:49,143 --> 01:45:50,940
It's all right now.
You can let me out.

1541
01:45:55,383 --> 01:45:56,975
Whoa!

1542

come here. Hurry!

Shh.

1544
01:46:02,268 --> 01:46:03,860
have I told you
not to shout?

1545
01:46:03,936 --> 01:46:05,267
It's her.
She's outside!

1546
01:46:05,338 --> 01:46:06,236
What's going on?

1547
01:46:06,305 --> 01:46:07,272
Are you sure?

1548
01:46:07,340 --> 01:46:09,240
I know that voice.
I heard her.

1549
01:46:09,308 --> 01:46:11,367
In a beautiful carriage
with two horses.

1550
01:46:11,444 --> 01:46:12,911
That's her.
She's come!

1551
01:46:12,979 --> 01:46:14,412
Who? Who's come?

1552
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:16,607
You wouldn't know her.
Mrs. Levi.

1553
01:46:19,218 --> 01:46:20,617
Is it true?

1554
01:46:20,686 --> 01:46:21,744
Yes. It's Dolly!

1555
01:46:21,821 --> 01:46:23,152
Tell the band
to get ready.

1556
01:46:23,222 --> 01:46:24,416
You saw her?

1557
01:46:24,490 --> 01:46:26,424
Yes. She was in
a white carriage

1558
01:46:26,492 --> 01:46:27,925
pulled
by four horses!

1559
01:46:27,994 --> 01:46:30,019
It's like
old times!

1560
01:46:30,129 --> 01:46:31,960

1563
01:46:37,036 --> 01:46:38,594
She is here.

1564
01:50:27,700 --> 01:50:30,066
Tell it to me sweet!

01:50:49,889 --> 01:50:52,414
I think you did,

Look who's here.

1567
01:52:33,596 --> 01:52:34,688
Hello, Louis.

1568
01:52:40,437 --> 01:52:42,428
I am so glad
to be back.

1569
01:52:44,040 --> 01:52:45,371
Thank you,
Louis.

1570
01:52:47,610 --> 01:52:48,702
Does it show?

1571

- Wow!
- Wow!

1572
01:55:04,147 --> 01:55:06,911
One more time!

1573
01:55:18,962 --> 01:55:21,021
Horace Vandergelder.

1574
01:55:22,932 --> 01:55:25,799
Do we know
each other?

1575
01:55:25,868 --> 01:55:27,267
Much too well.

1576
01:55:27,337 --> 01:55:29,965
Oh, it's you,
Mrs. Levi.

1577
01:55:30,039 --> 01:55:32,473
Yes.

1578
01:55:32,542 --> 01:55:34,874
Well, do you, um...

1579
01:55:34,944 --> 01:55:37,879
do you think
you have the figure

1580
01:55:37,947 --> 01:55:39,881
for that
sort of get-up?

1581
01:55:39,949 --> 01:55:41,883
That's for others to say.

1582
01:55:41,951 --> 01:55:43,350
I borrowed it
from a friend,

1583
01:55:43,419 --> 01:55:45,011
not being one
of those rich ladies

1584
01:55:45,088 --> 01:55:47,079
who have nothing better
to do with their time

1585
01:55:47,156 --> 01:55:48,885
than dilly-dally
with seamstresses.

1586
01:55:48,958 --> 01:55:50,926
Which reminds me,
where is Miss Simple?

1587
01:55:50,994 --> 01:55:52,427
Miss Simple?

1588
01:55:52,495 --> 01:55:53,393
Yes.

1589
01:55:53,463 --> 01:55:55,897
Well, she had to, uh...

1590
01:55:55,965 --> 01:55:58,900
She got called away
by a sick friend.

1591
01:55:58,968 --> 01:56:00,902
Oh, well,
that's Ernestina--

1592
01:56:00,970 --> 01:56:02,904
Always thinking
of other people.

1593
01:56:02,972 --> 01:56:05,907
We'll just have to
make do without her

1594
01:56:05,975 --> 01:56:07,875
for the time being.
Rudolph.

1595
01:56:07,944 --> 01:56:08,911
My dear Mrs. Levi!

1596
01:56:08,978 --> 01:56:10,377
I've saved the best
table for you.

1597
01:56:10,446 --> 01:56:11,640
How I've missed you,
Rudolph!

1598
01:56:11,714 --> 01:56:12,908
This way, please.

1599
01:56:12,982 --> 01:56:14,347
Come along,
Mr. Vandergelder.

1600
01:56:14,417 --> 01:56:15,850
Don't stand here.

1601
01:56:15,918 --> 01:56:18,887
You'll get run over
by a waiter.

1602
01:56:18,955 --> 01:56:20,889
Oh, hello!
How are you?

1603
01:56:20,957 --> 01:56:22,891
Hi! Nice to see you!

1604
01:56:22,959 --> 01:56:24,358
You know
too many people.

1605
01:56:24,427 --> 01:56:25,416
Total strangers.

1606
01:56:25,495 --> 01:56:26,962
Then why
do you greet them?

1607
01:56:27,030 --> 01:56:29,362
It feels good to have
so many friends.

1608
01:56:29,432 --> 01:56:31,400
Say hello
for me, too.

1609
01:56:31,467 --> 01:56:32,866
I already did.
Lovely, Rudolph.

1610
01:56:32,935 --> 01:56:34,926
What are we doing
down here?

1611
01:56:35,004 --> 01:56:36,938
There's someone in
the dance competition

1612
01:56:37,006 --> 01:56:38,371
I especially
want you to see.

1613
01:56:38,441 --> 01:56:41,376
Rudolph, this is
Mr. Vandergelder,

1614
01:56:41,444 --> 01:56:43,912
Yonkers' most
influential citizen.

1615
01:56:43,980 --> 01:56:45,379
We've already met.

1616
01:56:45,448 --> 01:56:46,813
He insists on
buying the finest.

1617
01:56:46,883 --> 01:56:47,907
I never said
any such thing.

1618
01:56:47,984 --> 01:56:48,882
Unfortunately,

1619
01:56:48,951 --> 01:56:49,918
I'm watching
my waistline.

1620
01:56:49,986 --> 01:56:51,920
Can't eat a thing.

1621
01:56:51,988 --> 01:56:53,387
What's ready
immediately?

1622
01:56:53,456 --> 01:56:54,889
You ordered chicken--

1623
01:56:54,957 --> 01:56:56,925
I couldn't
face a chicken.

1624
01:56:56,993 --> 01:56:58,824
Not after what
I've been through.

1625
01:56:58,895 --> 01:57:00,328
Cancel the chicken.

1626
01:57:00,396 --> 01:57:02,330
And bring a turkey!

1627
01:57:02,398 --> 01:57:04,332
With everything
on the side!

1628
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:06,834
Now, tell me about
you and Ernestina.

1629
01:57:06,903 --> 01:57:09,838
It was short,
but was it sweet?

1630
01:57:09,906 --> 01:57:13,467
I mean,
did it go well?

1631
01:57:13,543 --> 01:57:16,603
You have a habit of asking
highly personal questions.

1632
01:57:16,679 --> 01:57:19,477
If you're thinking
of getting married,

1633
01:57:19,549 --> 01:57:22,484
you must learn to
let women be women.

1634
01:57:22,552 --> 01:57:25,569
Did you like her?
Did she like you?

1635
01:57:25,703 --> 01:57:28,900
Always putting your nose
into other people's affairs!

1636
01:57:28,972 --> 01:57:33,375
Anybody who lived with you
would get as nervous as a cat!

1637
01:57:33,444 --> 01:57:34,433
What?

1638
01:57:34,511 --> 01:57:35,876
Anybody who lived
with you--

1639
01:57:35,946 --> 01:57:38,915
Get that idea
out of your head

1640
01:57:38,982 --> 01:57:39,949
this minute!

1641
01:57:40,017 --> 01:57:41,951
Why, the idea
of you

1642
01:57:42,019 --> 01:57:43,987
even mentioning
such a thing!

1643
01:57:44,054 --> 01:57:47,046
I have no intention
of marrying you!

1644
01:57:47,124 --> 01:57:48,853
I didn't mean that!

1645
01:57:48,926 --> 01:57:50,757
You've been hinting
for some time now,

1646
01:57:50,828 --> 01:57:53,353
so put those ideas
out of your head!

1647
01:57:53,430 --> 01:57:55,796
That's not what
I meant at all!

1648
01:57:55,866 --> 01:57:57,094
I should hope not!

1649
01:57:57,167 --> 01:57:58,464
You go your way
and I'll go mine.

1650
01:57:58,535 --> 01:57:59,797
You can't
turn my head

1651
01:57:59,870 --> 01:58:01,269
with chocolate
covered peanuts--

1652
01:58:01,338 --> 01:58:02,305
Unshelled!

1653
01:58:02,372 --> 01:58:03,805
The idea
of you even

1654
01:58:03,874 --> 01:58:05,535
suggesting
such a thing!

1655
01:58:05,609 --> 01:58:06,906
You misunderstood me!

1656
01:58:06,977 --> 01:58:10,037
I certainly hope so.
Let's not discuss it.

1657
01:58:10,114 --> 01:58:11,547
Here's our food.

1658
01:58:11,615 --> 01:58:13,515
I don't feel well.

1659
01:58:13,584 --> 01:58:16,519
Here is a lovely,
lovely wing for you,

1660
01:58:16,587 --> 01:58:19,750
and some dumplings,
lighter than air.

1661
01:58:19,823 --> 01:58:22,257
That's what I need--
some air.

1662
01:58:22,326 --> 01:58:23,918
And some giblets.

1663
01:58:23,994 --> 01:58:26,724
Very tender and
very good for you.

1664
01:58:26,797 --> 01:58:29,197
You go your way,
I'll go mine.

1665
01:58:29,266 --> 01:58:30,665
Have some wine.
You'll feel better.

1666
01:58:30,734 --> 01:58:32,429
Since you brought
this matter up,

1667
01:58:32,503 --> 01:58:34,869
I have one more
thing to say.

1668
01:58:34,938 --> 01:58:37,600
I didn't bring
the matter up!

1669
01:58:37,674 --> 01:58:40,165
True, I like to
manage things,

1670
01:58:40,244 --> 01:58:41,711
but nothing
as disorderly

1671
01:58:41,779 --> 01:58:43,269
as your household,

1672
01:58:43,347 --> 01:58:45,281
as out of control,
as untidy--

1673
01:58:45,349 --> 01:58:47,283
Do that
for yourself.

1674
01:58:47,351 --> 01:58:49,319
It's not
out of control!

1675
01:58:49,386 --> 01:58:51,377
Let's not say
another word about it.

1676
01:58:51,455 --> 01:58:52,854
Have some beets.

1677
01:58:52,923 --> 01:58:55,153
I don't like beets!

1678
01:58:55,225 --> 01:58:57,455
A complaining,
friendless soul like you

1679
01:58:57,528 --> 01:59:00,395
is no sort of
companion for me.

1680
01:59:00,464 --> 01:59:01,590
Stop saying that.

1681
01:59:01,665 --> 01:59:03,189
I'm finished.

1682
01:59:03,267 --> 01:59:05,098
I'm not those things
you said I am!

1683
01:59:05,169 --> 01:59:06,636
Maybe, but you are
the only person

1684
01:59:06,703 --> 01:59:07,897
in the world
that knows it.

1685
01:59:07,971 --> 01:59:08,938
No, Horace,

1686
01:59:09,006 --> 01:59:10,940
I have decided
to enjoy life.

1687
01:59:11,008 --> 01:59:12,908
You can find
some housekeeper

1688
01:59:12,976 --> 01:59:14,170
who'll prepare
three meals

1689
01:59:14,244 --> 01:59:15,233
for a dollar a day.
It can be done

1690
01:59:15,312 --> 01:59:16,609
if you like
cold beans--

1691
01:59:16,680 --> 01:59:18,307
I can see you now
spending your last days

1692
01:59:18,382 --> 01:59:19,906
listening
at keyholes,

1693
01:59:19,983 --> 01:59:22,451
for fear somebody's
cheating you.

1694
01:59:22,519 --> 01:59:24,419
Have
some more beets.

1695
01:59:24,488 --> 01:59:25,921
I hate beets!

1696
01:59:25,989 --> 01:59:27,752
That's the difference
between us.

1697
01:59:27,825 --> 01:59:29,850
I've been nagging you
all day long

1698
01:59:29,927 --> 01:59:30,916
to get some spirit
into you.

1699
01:59:30,994 --> 01:59:33,224
You could be
a perfectly charming,

1700
01:59:33,297 --> 01:59:34,958
witty, amiable man
if you wanted to.

1701
01:59:35,032 --> 01:59:37,193
I don't want
to be charming!

1702
01:59:37,267 --> 01:59:39,428
But you are!
Look at you!

1703
01:59:39,503 --> 01:59:40,663
You can't
help yourself.

1704
01:59:40,737 --> 01:59:41,897
''Listening
at keyholes.''

1705
01:59:41,972 --> 01:59:44,736
You have no right
to say such things to me.

1706
01:59:44,808 --> 01:59:46,833
At your age, you ought
to enjoy the truth.

1707
01:59:46,910 --> 01:59:49,708
My age. You're always
talking about my age!

1708
01:59:49,780 --> 01:59:51,372
I don't even know
what your age is,

1709
01:59:51,448 --> 01:59:53,177
but with bad food
and bad temper,

1710
01:59:53,250 --> 01:59:54,945
you'll double it
in six months.

1711
01:59:55,018 --> 01:59:57,145
Now sit down,
Horace!

1712
01:59:57,221 --> 01:59:59,382
However, there's
one more thing--

1713
01:59:59,456 --> 02:00:01,924
I don't want to hear it!
You're wasting your time.

1714
02:00:01,992 --> 02:00:04,358
I have no intention
of asking you to marry me!

1715
02:00:04,428 --> 02:00:06,988
Oh, so you want me
to ask you?

1716
02:00:07,064 --> 02:00:09,032
Sorry.
I'm turning you down.

1717
02:00:09,099 --> 02:00:11,431
How can you?
I haven't asked!

1718
02:00:11,501 --> 02:00:15,460
It's no use arguing.
Let me cut your wings.

1719
02:00:15,539 --> 02:00:18,099
I don't want
my wings cut!

1720
02:00:18,175 --> 02:00:19,733
No man does.

1721
02:00:19,810 --> 02:00:21,937
I've got a headache.
I'm leaving.

1722
02:00:22,012 --> 02:00:22,979
You can't.

1723
02:00:23,046 --> 02:00:24,911
The dance competition's
about to begin.

1724
02:00:25,249 --> 02:00:26,944
Ladies and gentlemen,

1725
02:00:27,017 --> 02:00:29,918
if I may have
your attention please!

1726
02:00:29,987 --> 02:00:32,717
It is my pleasure to announce
on behalf of the management

1727
02:00:32,789 --> 02:00:34,416
of the Harmonia Gardens
restaurant

1728
02:00:34,491 --> 02:00:38,222
that our dance contest
is about to commence!

1729
02:00:38,295 --> 02:00:41,423
The judges for
tonight's competition are--

1730
02:00:41,498 --> 02:00:43,728
Mr. Herman Fleishacker!

1731
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:46,633
[Fanfare]

1732
02:00:46,703 --> 02:00:47,965
Mr. Llewelyn Codd!

1733
02:00:48,038 --> 02:00:49,938
[Fanfare]

1734
02:00:50,007 --> 02:00:52,840
And our special
guest-of-honor judge,

1735
02:00:52,910 --> 02:00:55,811
Mrs. Dolly Levi!

1736
02:00:55,879 --> 02:00:58,905
[Fanfare]

1737
02:01:04,254 --> 02:01:06,415
Sit down!

1738
02:01:11,361 --> 02:01:14,489
If you wish to participate
in this evening's contest,

1739
02:01:14,564 --> 02:01:15,997
come to the dance floor.

1740
02:01:16,066 --> 02:01:18,296
Remember, to the lucky
winning couple

1741
02:01:18,368 --> 02:01:21,269
goes the grand prize
of 50 silver dollars

1742
02:01:21,338 --> 02:01:24,273
or an engagement at
the Harmonia Gardens!

1743
02:01:24,341 --> 02:01:25,865
50!

1744
02:01:25,943 --> 02:01:27,774
Everybody dance!

1745
02:01:27,844 --> 02:01:30,574
[Orchestra Plays]

1746
02:01:33,884 --> 02:01:35,784
Your check, sir.

1747
02:01:35,852 --> 02:01:37,945
Another bottle
of champagne.

1748
02:02:05,048 --> 02:02:06,913
Look at that man,
Horace!

1749
02:02:06,984 --> 02:02:08,952
What grace,
what talent,

1750
02:02:09,019 --> 02:02:10,418
what a magnificent
living

1751
02:02:10,487 --> 02:02:12,318
he could earn
with his feet!

1752
02:02:12,389 --> 02:02:13,481
Horace, look.

1753
02:02:13,557 --> 02:02:15,320
- Where?
- There.

1754
02:02:18,662 --> 02:02:20,095
Wait a minute.

1755
02:02:20,163 --> 02:02:22,063
Oh, isn't he wonderful!

1756
02:02:22,132 --> 02:02:25,033
That's Ambrose Kemper,
the so-called artist.

1757
02:02:25,102 --> 02:02:27,229
Why, so it is.

1758
02:02:27,304 --> 02:02:29,772
No wonder his pictures
are so awful.

1759
02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:31,239
He must paint
with his feet.

1760
02:02:31,308 --> 02:02:32,366
He's sure to win
first prize.

1761
02:02:32,442 --> 02:02:33,773
Ermengarde
should see him now,

1762
02:02:33,844 --> 02:02:35,812
dancing with
another girl.

1763
02:02:35,879 --> 02:02:38,109
And so pretty, too.

1764
02:02:38,181 --> 02:02:40,274
Shameful!
That's what it is!

1765
02:02:40,350 --> 02:02:41,942
Shameful!

1766
02:02:51,862 --> 02:02:53,796
Look! There's
that Molloy woman

1767
02:02:53,864 --> 02:02:55,422
dancing with a man!

1768
02:02:55,499 --> 02:02:57,524
I think it's a man.

1769
02:02:59,903 --> 02:03:01,234
Only a few hours ago

1770
02:03:01,304 --> 02:03:03,534
she was waiting
for me to propose.

1771
02:03:03,607 --> 02:03:04,733
Shocking!

1772
02:03:04,808 --> 02:03:06,867
No faithfulness
left in this world!

1773
02:03:06,943 --> 02:03:07,932
Oh, I agree.

1774
02:03:08,011 --> 02:03:10,241
People like us
should marry someone

1775
02:03:10,313 --> 02:03:14,272
just to set the world
a good example.

1776
02:03:19,773 --> 02:03:21,365
My hat!

1777
02:03:25,713 --> 02:03:27,704
I'm trying to find--

1778
02:03:27,781 --> 02:03:28,748
Oh.

1779
02:03:28,816 --> 02:03:30,647
Excuse me.

1780
02:03:36,423 --> 02:03:38,550
Ermengarde!

1781
02:03:39,827 --> 02:03:40,885
Uncle.

1782
02:03:40,961 --> 02:03:42,428
My niece!

1783
02:03:42,496 --> 02:03:44,157
Aah!

1784
02:03:45,099 --> 02:03:47,932
You are a disgrace
to Yonkers!

1785
02:03:48,001 --> 02:03:49,400
Stop that!

1786
02:03:51,805 --> 02:03:54,069
Grrr!

1787
02:03:54,141 --> 02:03:55,631
Don't you dare--

1788
02:03:55,709 --> 02:03:57,301
Come here, you!

1789
02:04:00,080 --> 02:04:02,048
Mr. Vandergelder,
the contest!

1790
02:04:02,116 --> 02:04:04,482
I'll show you a contest!

1791
02:04:07,321 --> 02:04:09,687
Call the police!

1792
02:04:09,757 --> 02:04:11,782
Call the police!

1793
02:04:13,460 --> 02:04:16,122
Uncle Horace,
we can explain!

1794
02:04:16,196 --> 02:04:18,562
Expl--I'll give you...

1795
02:04:40,020 --> 02:04:42,921
Cornelius Hackl!
What are you doing here?

1796
02:04:42,990 --> 02:04:44,924
I'm just delivering
some oats.

1797
02:04:44,992 --> 02:04:46,960
Oats? With my
former intended?

1798
02:04:47,027 --> 02:04:47,925
You're discharged!

1799
02:04:47,995 --> 02:04:50,463
You can't fire me!
I quit!

1800
02:04:50,531 --> 02:04:51,930
So do I!

1801
02:04:51,999 --> 02:04:53,933
Barnaby Tucker,
you're discharged!

1802
02:04:54,001 --> 02:04:56,595
You can't fire me!
I quit!

1803
02:05:06,980 --> 02:05:08,538
I'm sorry.

1804
02:05:17,524 --> 02:05:18,616
Grrr!

1805
02:05:25,465 --> 02:05:26,557
Oh!

1806
02:05:29,136 --> 02:05:30,899
Horace Vandergelder,

1807
02:05:30,971 --> 02:05:34,566
flat on your back,
you are still charming.

1808
02:05:36,510 --> 02:05:37,943
Cornelius.

1809
02:05:38,011 --> 02:05:39,876
Barnaby.

1810
02:05:39,947 --> 02:05:43,439
Perhaps there's a way
I can get Mr. Vandergelder

1811
02:05:43,517 --> 02:05:45,951
to give you back
your jobs.

1812
02:05:46,019 --> 02:05:48,078
What? How?

1813
02:05:49,523 --> 02:05:52,083
I could become his wife.

1814
02:05:55,095 --> 02:05:56,528
No, that's impossible.

1815
02:05:56,597 --> 02:05:57,825
It is?

1816
02:05:57,898 --> 02:05:59,092
Yes.

1817
02:05:59,166 --> 02:06:00,827
But why,
Cornelius?

1818
02:06:00,901 --> 02:06:03,495
Because...
That's why.

1819
02:06:03,570 --> 02:06:05,162
Give me a reason.

1820
02:06:05,239 --> 02:06:06,399
Never mind the reason!

1821
02:06:06,473 --> 02:06:07,405
Shhh!

1822
02:06:07,474 --> 02:06:08,441
And don't tell me
to shush.

1823
02:06:08,508 --> 02:06:09,600
What's going on?

1824
02:06:09,676 --> 02:06:11,507
- Cornelius!
- Irene!

1825
02:06:11,578 --> 02:06:14,775
Hey, you, what's
all this noise?

1826
02:06:14,848 --> 02:06:16,338
What's happening here?

1827
02:06:16,416 --> 02:06:18,441
Now you stay out
of this, Officer!

1828
02:06:18,518 --> 02:06:19,576
Are you all right, miss?

1829
02:06:19,653 --> 02:06:21,018
I'll let you know
in a little while.

1830
02:06:21,088 --> 02:06:23,886
I'm only trying to tell
this lady something.

1831
02:06:23,957 --> 02:06:25,356
It's too late,
and you're too loud,

1832
02:06:25,425 --> 02:06:26,892
you're disturbing
the peace!

1833
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:29,394
No, it's not too late!

1834
02:06:29,463 --> 02:06:31,363
That's why I'm shouting!

1835
02:06:31,431 --> 02:06:34,400
28 years, my whole life,
I never did anything!

1836
02:06:34,468 --> 02:06:36,402
I just worked,
took orders,

1837
02:06:36,470 --> 02:06:37,903
never went anywhere.

1838
02:06:37,971 --> 02:06:39,598
Stayed in Yonkers!

1839
02:06:39,673 --> 02:06:40,662
Yonkers?

1840
02:06:40,741 --> 02:06:43,403
And today,
the most important thing

1841
02:06:43,477 --> 02:06:45,911
that can happen to a man

1842
02:06:45,979 --> 02:06:48,914
happened to me
because I left Yonkers

1843
02:06:48,982 --> 02:06:50,882
and came to New York

1844
02:06:50,951 --> 02:06:55,388
and met this lady
this afternoon.

1845
02:06:55,455 --> 02:06:59,186
Mister--Just what
are you talkin' about?

1846
02:06:59,259 --> 02:07:00,385
Officer,

1847
02:07:00,460 --> 02:07:04,920
I'm talking about
none other than love.

1848
02:07:04,998 --> 02:07:05,930
Love?

1849
02:07:05,999 --> 02:07:07,330
Love?

1850
02:07:07,401 --> 02:07:11,337
Are you telling me that
after 28 years in Yonkers

1851
02:07:11,405 --> 02:07:14,863
you've fallen in love
with this lady in one day?

1852
02:07:14,942 --> 02:07:17,376
No, I didn't
fall in love

1853
02:07:17,444 --> 02:07:18,843
in just a day.

1854
02:07:18,912 --> 02:07:21,005
It was much quicker
than that.

1855
02:07:21,081 --> 02:07:23,379
An hour--No, even
that's too long!

1856
02:07:23,450 --> 02:07:24,849
What's less
than a minute?

1857
02:07:24,918 --> 02:07:25,850
A second?

1858
02:07:25,919 --> 02:07:26,851
Less than that.

1859
02:07:26,920 --> 02:07:28,353
A moment.

1860
02:07:28,422 --> 02:07:30,856
That's it!
That is it!

1861
02:07:30,924 --> 02:07:34,860
Now all of you,
listen to me...

1862
02:07:34,928 --> 02:07:37,522
please.

1863
02:09:01,381 --> 02:09:04,316
Isn't the world
full of wonderful things?

1864
02:09:04,384 --> 02:09:06,579
I have lost
so many things.

1865
02:09:06,653 --> 02:09:08,587
My job, my future--

1866
02:09:08,655 --> 02:09:11,317
Everything that people
think is important,

1867
02:09:11,391 --> 02:09:12,824
but I don't care!

1868
02:09:12,893 --> 02:09:14,622
Even if I have
to dig ditches

1869
02:09:14,694 --> 02:09:15,900
for the rest of my life,

1870
02:09:16,034 --> 02:09:20,835
I'll be a ditch digger
who once had a wonderful day!

1871
02:09:20,905 --> 02:09:22,805
Mister, do you mind?

1872
02:09:22,874 --> 02:09:24,808
I came in late.

1873
02:09:24,876 --> 02:09:27,674
Right after...

1874
02:11:30,768 --> 02:11:31,666
Tell Rudolph

1875
02:11:31,736 --> 02:11:33,795
not to worry
about the damage.

1876
02:11:33,871 --> 02:11:35,304
Send the bill

1877
02:11:35,373 --> 02:11:37,841
to Vandergelder's
Hay and Feed Store,

1878
02:11:37,909 --> 02:11:39,638
Yonkers, New York.

1879
02:11:39,710 --> 02:11:42,304
There's your life
for you, Horace.

1880
02:11:42,380 --> 02:11:44,848
I don't want
to hear about it!

1881
02:11:44,916 --> 02:11:46,850
Without niece,
bride, clerks.

1882
02:11:46,918 --> 02:11:48,943
I'm tired.
I've got a backache.

1883
02:11:49,020 --> 02:11:50,453
That's about
all you do have.

1884
02:11:50,521 --> 02:11:51,681
I hope you're
satisfied.

1885
02:11:51,756 --> 02:11:52,723
Never mind.

1886
02:11:52,790 --> 02:11:55,350
I guess there's only
one thing more

1887
02:11:55,426 --> 02:11:56,916
for me to say.

1888
02:11:56,994 --> 02:11:59,224
If it's to ask me
to marry you,

1889
02:11:59,297 --> 02:12:00,855
never,
not in a million years!

1890
02:12:00,932 --> 02:12:03,264
It wasn't that
at all, Horace.

1891
02:12:03,334 --> 02:12:05,768
All I wanted
to say was...

1892
02:12:07,838 --> 02:12:08,770
What?

1893
02:12:10,041 --> 02:12:11,099
What are you
talking about?

1894
02:12:19,517 --> 02:12:20,916
Nonsense!

1895
02:12:20,985 --> 02:12:22,816
Don't try to stop me!

1896
02:13:37,862 --> 02:13:41,457
And on those cold
winter nights, Horace...

1897
02:13:45,903 --> 02:13:49,964
you can snuggle up
to your cash register.

1898
02:13:53,377 --> 02:13:56,938
It's a little lumpy,
but it rings.

1899
02:14:26,911 --> 02:14:29,436
[Gasping]

1900
02:14:44,362 --> 02:14:45,829
[JingleJingle]

1901
02:14:45,896 --> 02:14:47,295
[Woof]

1902
02:14:47,365 --> 02:14:49,458
[Woof Woof]

1903
02:14:54,405 --> 02:14:56,305
Quiet!

1904
02:14:56,374 --> 02:14:58,899
Quiet down there,
you little monsters.

1905
02:14:58,976 --> 02:15:01,001
Cornelius! Barnaby!

1906
02:15:02,947 --> 02:15:05,347
Do you hear me down there?

1907
02:15:05,416 --> 02:15:07,350
Ermengarde!

1908
02:15:07,418 --> 02:15:09,852
What the devil is this?

1909
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:13,014
What's this chicken mash
doing all over?

1910
02:15:18,863 --> 02:15:21,491
Cornelius! Barnaby!

1911
02:15:21,565 --> 02:15:25,695
Get up here this minute
and clean up this mess!

1912
02:15:31,976 --> 02:15:33,375
Well, good riddance.

1913
02:15:33,444 --> 02:15:37,380
I didn't need you before,
and I don't need you now!

1914
02:15:37,448 --> 02:15:38,813
Ermengarde!

1915
02:15:38,883 --> 02:15:40,874
I'm ready for
my breakfast!

1916
02:15:40,951 --> 02:15:43,920
I want three eggs
with crisp bacon,

1917
02:15:43,988 --> 02:15:45,922
hot porridge with cream,

1918
02:15:45,990 --> 02:15:47,548
and grits!

1919
02:15:53,497 --> 02:15:55,055
It's not fair.

1920
02:15:56,967 --> 02:15:58,935
It's worse than that.

1921
02:15:59,003 --> 02:16:01,062
It's lonely.

1922
02:16:07,478 --> 02:16:12,916
Not in a million years,
Dolly Levi.

1923
02:16:12,983 --> 02:16:17,579
You go your way,
and I'll go mine.

1924
02:16:22,493 --> 02:16:24,927
Good morning,
Uncle Horace.

1925
02:16:24,995 --> 02:16:26,860
Good morning,
Mr. Vandergelder.

1926
02:16:26,931 --> 02:16:28,956
Come crawling back,
have you?

1927
02:16:29,033 --> 02:16:31,968
I've a good mind
not to take you,

1928
02:16:32,036 --> 02:16:34,197
but being as how
I'm so soft-hearted,

1929
02:16:34,271 --> 02:16:36,034
start cleaning up
this mess!

1930
02:16:36,106 --> 02:16:38,574
We're not coming back
to work for you,

1931
02:16:38,642 --> 02:16:39,810
Mr. Vandergelder.

1932
02:16:39,944 --> 02:16:41,411
Barnaby and I

1933
02:16:41,478 --> 02:16:43,412
are stopping by
for our money.

1934
02:16:43,480 --> 02:16:46,142
We decided to
go into business.

1935
02:16:46,216 --> 02:16:47,649
Business!

1936
02:16:47,718 --> 02:16:49,777
And since we only
know hay and feed,

1937
02:16:49,853 --> 02:16:51,616
we're opening
our own store.

1938
02:16:51,689 --> 02:16:54,351
Mrs. Levi's found
the perfect location.

1939
02:16:54,425 --> 02:16:56,222
Across the street
from you.

1940
02:16:56,293 --> 02:16:57,453
She wouldn't dare!

1941
02:16:57,528 --> 02:17:00,588
Hackl and Tucker,
Incorporated.

1942
02:17:00,664 --> 02:17:02,723
Ha! You'll last a week.

1943
02:17:02,800 --> 02:17:04,427
What about my breakfast?

1944
02:17:04,501 --> 02:17:06,992
Uncle Horace...

1945
02:17:07,071 --> 02:17:09,562
I think you'd better
start learning

1946
02:17:09,640 --> 02:17:14,407
how to make it yourself.

1947
02:17:14,478 --> 02:17:16,378
All right,
all right.

1948
02:17:16,447 --> 02:17:17,505
My conscience
is clear.

1949
02:17:17,581 --> 02:17:19,412
A man can only do so
much to keep fools

1950
02:17:19,483 --> 02:17:20,882
from their own
natural folly.

1951
02:17:20,951 --> 02:17:24,478
Why, Horace Vandergelder,
as I live and breathe.

1952
02:17:24,555 --> 02:17:27,183
How well you look today.

1953
02:17:27,257 --> 02:17:29,748
I came by
to return your cane.

1954
02:17:29,827 --> 02:17:32,819
Don't let me interrupt.
What were you doing?

1955
02:17:32,896 --> 02:17:34,864
Getting Cornelius
and Barnaby's money.

1956
02:17:34,932 --> 02:17:37,196
$1 46.3 5.

1957
02:17:37,267 --> 02:17:39,394
Plus $6.1 2 of mine.

1958
02:17:39,470 --> 02:17:41,062
And the money
my mama left me.

1959
02:17:41,138 --> 02:17:44,801
That's right.
$52.48.

1960
02:17:44,875 --> 02:17:46,740
38, idiot!

1961
02:17:46,810 --> 02:17:48,573
48, Uncle.

1962
02:17:49,747 --> 02:17:50,645
I'm positive--

1963
02:17:50,714 --> 02:17:52,614
I know, I know.

1964
02:17:52,683 --> 02:17:55,413
If all you can
think about is money,

1965
02:17:55,486 --> 02:17:58,683
the safe is upstairs!

1966
02:17:58,756 --> 02:18:00,314
Ooh!

1967
02:18:03,260 --> 02:18:05,694
And I have
the combination!

1968
02:18:05,763 --> 02:18:07,253
You stay here.

1969
02:18:07,331 --> 02:18:09,595
If you insist,
Horace.

1970
02:18:27,251 --> 02:18:31,688
Ephraim Levi,
I'm gonna get married again.

1971
02:18:31,755 --> 02:18:35,851
I'm gonna marry
Horace Vandergelder.

1972
02:18:37,795 --> 02:18:40,195
And I'm asking
your permission.

1973
02:18:40,264 --> 02:18:44,701
It won't be a marriage
in the sense that we had one,

1974
02:18:44,768 --> 02:18:47,737
but I shall certainly
make him happy.

1975
02:18:47,805 --> 02:18:50,205
You can be sure of that.

1976
02:18:50,274 --> 02:18:53,243
I am going to marry
Horace Vandergelder

1977
02:18:53,310 --> 02:18:56,245
and send his money
out into the world

1978
02:18:56,313 --> 02:18:59,180
doing all the things
you taught me.

1979
02:18:59,249 --> 02:19:01,149
As you always said, Ephraim,

1980
02:19:01,218 --> 02:19:02,651
money--
pardon the expression--

1981
02:19:02,719 --> 02:19:04,687
is like manure.

1982
02:19:04,755 --> 02:19:08,657
It's not worth a thing
unless it's spread around,

1983
02:19:08,725 --> 02:19:11,159
encouraging
young things to grow.

1984
02:19:11,228 --> 02:19:13,662
Anyhow,
that's the opinion of

1985
02:19:13,730 --> 02:19:16,665
the future
Mrs. Horace Vandergelder.

1986
02:19:16,733 --> 02:19:18,667
And, Ephraim...

1987
02:19:18,735 --> 02:19:21,898
I'm still waiting
for that sign...

1988
02:19:21,972 --> 02:19:23,837
that you approve.

1989
02:19:29,847 --> 02:19:31,314
Mr. Vandergelder--

1990
02:19:31,381 --> 02:19:32,973
Outside, front and back.

1991
02:19:40,691 --> 02:19:45,719
Bossy, scheming,
meddling, irritating,

1992
02:19:45,796 --> 02:19:48,560
inquisitive,
exasperating.

1993
02:19:48,632 --> 02:19:50,623
Horace.

1994
02:19:52,069 --> 02:19:54,469
I know you're no
longer interested,

1995
02:19:54,538 --> 02:19:57,974
but I have found you
the ideal wife.

1996
02:19:58,041 --> 02:20:01,477
Dolly Levi, I don't want you
to find me any ideal wives!

1997
02:20:01,545 --> 02:20:04,275
If I want an ideal wife,
I'll find one of my own,

1998
02:20:04,348 --> 02:20:08,341
and I have found her,
and it's you, damn it!

1999
02:20:08,418 --> 02:20:11,910
I've been a fool and
probably always will be,

2000
02:20:11,989 --> 02:20:13,923
but, Dolly,
forgive me and...

2001
02:20:13,991 --> 02:20:15,856
marry me.

2002
02:20:19,530 --> 02:20:21,430
No, Horace, I...

2003
02:20:21,498 --> 02:20:23,693
I don't dare.

2004
02:20:23,767 --> 02:20:25,928
What do you mean?

2005
02:20:26,003 --> 02:20:28,938
You know
as well as I do

2006
02:20:29,006 --> 02:20:30,940
that you're
the first citizen

2007
02:20:31,008 --> 02:20:31,940
of Yonkers.

2008
02:20:32,009 --> 02:20:34,978
Your wife would have
to be a somebody.

2009
02:20:35,045 --> 02:20:36,945
You are. You are
a wonderful woman!

2010
02:20:37,014 --> 02:20:40,450
Do you really think
I have it in me

2011
02:20:40,517 --> 02:20:43,486
to forego fancy clothes
and expensive jewels,

2012
02:20:43,554 --> 02:20:45,818
and instead be
a benefactress

2013
02:20:45,889 --> 02:20:48,289
to half the town?

2014
02:20:48,358 --> 02:20:50,588
In other words,

2015
02:20:50,661 --> 02:20:52,629
to be a credit to you?

2016
02:20:54,064 --> 02:20:55,964
Dolly, everybody knows

2017
02:20:56,033 --> 02:20:59,901
that you could do
anything you wanted to do.

2018
02:20:59,970 --> 02:21:02,404
By the way,
here's the money

2019
02:21:02,472 --> 02:21:04,406
I borrowed
from you yesterday.

2020
02:21:04,474 --> 02:21:06,237
Keep it.

2021
02:21:09,379 --> 02:21:10,812
Oh, Horace.

2022
02:21:10,881 --> 02:21:12,314
I never thought

2023
02:21:12,382 --> 02:21:17,319
I'd ever hear you
say anything like that.

2024
02:21:17,387 --> 02:21:19,321
It's bad business
letting Cornelius

2025
02:21:19,389 --> 02:21:22,209
open up a store
across the street.

2026
02:21:22,343 --> 02:21:23,708
It was your idea.

2027
02:21:23,777 --> 02:21:24,937
Make him your partner.

2028
02:21:25,012 --> 02:21:27,105
And Barnaby can have
Cornelius' old job.

2029
02:21:27,181 --> 02:21:30,378
We'll all dance at
Ermengarde's wedding.

2030
02:21:30,451 --> 02:21:33,784
You've gone too far!
I'll dance at no wedding!

2031
02:21:33,854 --> 02:21:35,082
Besides, I can't dance!

2032
02:21:35,155 --> 02:21:36,383
It'll take years
to learn.

2033
02:21:36,457 --> 02:21:37,788
All right, I'll dance.

2034
02:21:37,858 --> 02:21:39,792
Excuse me,
Mr. Vandergelder.

2035
02:21:39,860 --> 02:21:40,884
I said outside!

2036
02:21:40,961 --> 02:21:43,293
What is going on
around here?

2037
02:21:43,364 --> 02:21:47,130
I'm having the shutters
done over in forest green.

2038
02:21:48,402 --> 02:21:49,801
Forest green shutters?

2039
02:21:49,870 --> 02:21:51,667
The old paint's
still good,

2040
02:21:51,739 --> 02:21:53,798
but that fella's
just set up a business

2041
02:21:53,874 --> 02:21:55,341
and needs
a good start.

2042
02:21:55,409 --> 02:21:58,071
Dolly, I've always felt
that money--

2043
02:21:58,145 --> 02:22:00,773
Pardon the expression--
is like manure.

2044
02:22:00,848 --> 02:22:02,782
It's not worth a thing

2045
02:22:02,850 --> 02:22:04,249
unless its
spread around,

2046
02:22:04,318 --> 02:22:06,752
encouraging
young things to grow.

2047
02:22:06,820 --> 02:22:09,220
Thank you, Ephraim.

2048
02:23:19,026 --> 02:23:21,085
Wonderful woman!
