00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,081
* Violin *

2
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,089
What is it?
- I've written, Dad.

3
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,444
Can not you even do, what I say?

4
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,164
* Frenetic jubilation *

5
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,648
The people entertain

* People entertain further. '

7
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,443
* People entertain further. '

8
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,844
Threatening music

9
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,802
Distinguished ladies and gentlemen.

10
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,122
I play now for you

11
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,245
the animal sounds Caprice.

12
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,128
Lah! lah!

13
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,690
Ah!

14
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,090
Lah! You are a genius!

15
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,650
Again the donkey! lah, lah, lah.

16
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,248
Signor Paganini?

17
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,643
Signor Paganini!

18
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,409
Signor Paganini, it's late
If your still one more night?

19
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,767
The bill must be paid.

20
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,682
Signor Paganini.

21
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,048
Here please. And now I must sleep.

22
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:59,286
You had champagne and food.
Pays or I'll call the city Vogt.

23
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,404
' Palpitations * Who's there?

24
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,284
I am.
- Who?

25
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,851
We met yesterday.
- Come on! beginning.

26
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,090
I have to pay, Signore
- Come inside.

27
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,569
Three times need you to tell
- Come on in!

28
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,444
Your champagne was
warm and watered down.

29
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,087
Your dishes were bland and
your behavior intolerable.

30
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,290
Who pays for the damage?
- That should be enough, Signore.

31
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,442
Now, please disappear.

32
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,564
The Maestro may not be disturbed.

33
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,723
And you, Signorina

34
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,604
Antonia, stay. Do not go.

35
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,523
Darling, I'll come back later.

36
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,807
I do not want to disturb.
- This man goes right back.

37
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,410
See you later. Ciao.

38
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,770
You come back. With the invoice
- So a it is not.

39
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,401
You will require for the child money.

40
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,243
Where do you want to know?
- So it has always been.

41
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,686
Signore?
- Urbani.

42
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,849
Can you come back later? Or tomorrow?

43
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,680
You can expect a great future.

44
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,286
Let us begin.
- What are you talking about?

45
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,809
Yesterday we persuaded
all that. Your not Know?

46
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,284
You will, that you is a kingdom feet.

47
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,809
From Paris to Vienna.
From Rome to London.

48
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,643
One should recognize, that
you are the greatest violinist.

49
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,082
I can play where I want.

50
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,244
And when I want. Someone always pays.

51
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,571
You are happy to be the lackey
in the house of the prince?

52
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,247
The monkeys to play,
while you chat and feeds.

53
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,164
You had to humiliate you
more people listening to you.

54
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,166
I know my music is triumph.

55
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,002
How should they triumph, if
no one is listening to you?

56
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,609
In 100 years, maybe someone
is a music sheet of you find

57
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,765
and recognize the true
nature of your genius.

58
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,527
Ha? That should satisfy you?

59
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,087
You are an innovator.

60
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,567
The violin is in your
hands to the orchestra.

61
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,043
You discovered harmonies

62
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,682
from which no one suspected existed.

63
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,970
It's almost like you have
your create a new instrument.

64
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,331
This is your genius.
And also your problem.

65
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,650
If the audience has
never heard your music,

66
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,523
How will it know whether the
music he likes it or rather not.

67
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,969
And in order not to stand as
fools, they prefer to talk.

68
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,650
Told you must be that
the music in front of you

69
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,522
is revolutionary, unique and sublime.

70
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,766
You must be excited.

71
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,322
And maybe even a bit confused,

72
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,205
before they have even heard a note

73
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,168
Talent and skill, of which
you have in abundance.

74
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,164
What you lack, is a story.

75
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,843
With me by your side

76
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,641
Your worries forever thing of the past.

77
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,010
I'll take care of everything.
I will be your servant.

78
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,162
Your slave.

79
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,211
And you simply do just
that, what you love.

80
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,001
Play your music.

81
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,606
And finally will become known.

82
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,446
Why you do me this favor?

83
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,604
Say what you want. Significantly.

84
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,563
I vow to be you to
services. Here and now.

85
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,850
The smallest hint makes me to your tool.

86
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,609
And if we meet again in the afterlife,

87
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,367
You are to me committed
to the same service.

88
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,768
In the afterlife?

89
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,042
What are you talking about? What
do I care about the afterlife?

90
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,728
There is only the here and now.

91
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,566
Let us conquer the world
- Yes.

92
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,168
After that, come what would
- So you please me.

93
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,769
I will not hear of it.
- You prescribe me.

94
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,050
And you will soon be celebrated
in the best Theatre of Milan.

95
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,604
No other obligations?
- None.

96
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,041
Agreed.

97
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,923
Consider it carefully.
Because I will not forget.

98
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,440
I warn you also.

99
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,281
My ambition is immeasurable.
- Yes.

100
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,805
So it should be, Maestro.

101
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,603
Is as it should be.

102
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,891
There would be only one thing:

103
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,204
I need you to ask for
anything a signature.

104
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,841
He hits the center of the heart.

105
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,083
His instrument is no more violin,

106
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,528
it is a living entity,
the fear and sadness

107
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,444
sobs and shudders

108
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,083
Well, well. Above all,
he is a master conman.

109
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,125
Let me see. He ​​must
return to the hairdresser.

110
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,410
He learned to play in prison.
- What?

111
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,161
His violin was the only he
possessed in solitary confinement.

112
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,210
Its strings pulled one after another.

113
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,728
He can play a concerto
only on the G string.

114
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,727
Elizabeth, dear, that's impossible.

115
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,162
Why was the thug locked up?

116
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,689
They say he has his mistress
killed out of jealousy.

117
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,046
Ah, you mean to tell
me this Italian rascal

118
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,368
is my rival for your heart?

119
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,011
Do not forget: You are
my lover, Elizabeth.

120
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,003
I would immediately leave you for him.

121
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,849
Do you like to do? Is your company?

122
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,762
Come.
- No, no, no. So do not.

123
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,850
Mr. Rogers.
- Hello, Mr. Watson.

124
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,401
Is it good? Excellent. And you?

125
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,523
All the best.
- Glad.

126
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,921
How's Mom?
- Fabulous.

127
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,560
Even in Camberwell?
- The same apartment.

128
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,724
I have an appointment here.
- With who?

129
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:35,125
Personally with Lord Burghersh.
His lordship dined at the club.

130
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,647
* It occurs in something. *

131
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,807
Forgive me. Are you a club member?

132
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,205
I'm here to talk to Lordsburg Hersh.

133
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,966
And whom should I report?

134
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,808
My card.

135
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,603
Edwards.
- This is ridiculous.

136
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,761
Everyone in London knows me
as an important impresario.

137
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,605
Unfortunately Those are the rules, sir.

138
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,368
My lord.

139
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,410
I represent the greatest
violinists in the world

140
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,241
No, thank you.

141
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,163
From whom am I speaking?
- Every fool is known,

142
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,527
that the greatest violinist Paganini is

143
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,329
You are not a fool.
Lordsburg Hersh expect.

144
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,207
Lordsburg Hersh, I
should introduce myself?

145
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,250
I'm John Watson.
- Very pleased.

146
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,808
But I'm busy.

147
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,361
Forgive! my intrusion

148
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,882
and the brazenness with
the I come before you.

149
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,806
But I have to make a urgent proposal,

150
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,090
Which liberate not only the
Opera House of the difficulties

151
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,044
London but will meet with shine.

152
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,205
After an introduction such
I would be really a goal,

153
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,409
I did not listen to you.
- Thank you, my lord.

154
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,322
I suggest to bring
Niccolo Paganini to London.

155
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,763
To an exclusive concert series
at the Opera House to give.

156
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,322
His fame and his virtuosity

157
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,966
surpass anything what we know here.

158
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,126
So that we at least 10
times had a sell out.

159
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,205
The press is obsessed
by the Italian maestro.

160
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,566
Paganini?
- His concert in Paris last week

161
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,282
19,069 played France a, a concert.

162
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,966
I do not doubt, Mr. Watson.

163
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:03,043
But I doubt your ability
to Paganini to get here.

164
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,082
Dear Maestro Paganini.

165
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,929
In deepest devotion
in front of your genius

166
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,610
as the most outstanding
musicians of our time

167
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,402
I want you herewith an invitation

168
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,808

in Covent Garden in London express.

170
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,965
We want to offer you,

172

In the kingdom of His
Majesty of Great Britain.

173
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,207
And Ireland.

174
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,525
To make this project

175
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,604
I have the letter settled a change.

176
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,367
For submission to a
certain Rothschild Bank.

177
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:57,641
So that your has enough funds
which you serve as an advance

178

But that lasts not forever

The fall of a new attraction

Thus, one should sing.

00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,729
Please, do not argue.

Talent is not everything.
It must be shaped.

Be diligent. Listen to your stepmother.

He wants an entire floor of the hotel.

267
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,051
I know it sounds exorbitant
But he has good reasons.

268
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,090
Music publishers would
beside him room to rent.

269
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,404
And spies would overhear
him publish and his music.

00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,331
There is a lot of space up there.

356
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,965
Say, it's burning?

357
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,323
Uh, no. This is typical of London.

358
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,682
And you survive I can hardly breathe.

359
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,571
The maestro's health not robust.

360
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:32,688
Oh, a handkerchief to the rescue
- Yuck! Schauderhaft.

361
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,449
The coal dust is good for
the lung because he opens it.

362
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,203
(Chanting) No mercy for rapists!

363
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:59,002
No asylum for devil
worshipers! Resist the wicked!

364
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,046
No mercy for rapists!

365
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,285
No asylum for devil
worshipers! Resist the wicked!

366
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,441
Only a small demonstration.
Let's go to the hotel.

367
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,929
No mercy for rapists!
- Quiet, the ladies!

368
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,085
What is this noise?
- Do not touch me, sir!

369
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,729
I'm Primrose Blackstone. We are
the Women's Federation for virtue.

370
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,689
I know my rights.

371
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,968
And we raise our voices.

372
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,401
Behalf of the innocent women.

373
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:37,721
I'll call the police.
- We will not sell us.

374
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,765
We will wait all night.

375
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,446
Until he appears.
- Who?

376
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,808
Paganini. Supposedly he has
leased a whole floor with you.

377
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,611
A waste, unparalleled.

378
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,651
Go! yet further.
- No mercy for rapists!

379
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,167
No asylum for devil worshipers!

380
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,251
Can I ask while your protest?

381
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,802
My companion and I
want quartered us here.

382
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,010
But we can not.
- The thing is not for jokes.

383
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,130
Paganini This is a notorious seducer

384
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,329
And he worships the devil.
- No?

385
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,361
This is terrible. What
can we do about it?

386
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,331
Chase him. Keep bothering him.

387
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,644
No mercy for rapists!
- Frauenschänder!

388
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,930
No asylum for devil worshipers!
- Devil worshipers!

389
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,287
Music to my ears.

390
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,761
No mercy for rapists! No
asylum for devil worshipers!

391
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,763
Forgive. We had not expected it

392
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:52,608
I look to see if everything
is to your satisfaction.

393
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,641
Is he here?
- We keep trouble at the hotel.

394
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,606
You will be staying here.
- My goodness!

395
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,206
We do not have a
butler and no furniture.

396
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,410
I told that we are only moved.

397
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,444
What? He's here? Do you play the maid?

398
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,129
Papa! And what about Elizabeth?
We introduce them as my wife.

399
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,241
Last. Then I waited.
- We do not have time.

400
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,761
Ah, gentlemen. Welcome
to my humble home.

401
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,082
This way. Sir.

402
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,364
Ah, it's my honor to
introduce you to my wife

403
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,809
Elizabeth. Elizabeth,

Signor Paganini, I am very pleased.

405
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,008
London awaited your arrival.
- This is Signor Urbani.

406
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:58,011
Did you have a pleasant journey?
- In fact, Mrs... Watson.

407
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,208
Watson, yes.
- How charming.

408
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,001
What a wonderful home.

409
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,085

you before you're set.

410
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,961
No, you are welcome.
We have a cozy room.

411
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,044
friendly.
- We take care of the luggage.

412
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,007
Charlotte? Charlotte?

413
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,042
The maid takes das. Very good.

414
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,601
Well, great.

415
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,611
A bit faster, if that's all right.

416
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,604
Thank you.
- Very much luggage.

417
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,880
Yes. Well, if you are traveling.

418
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,127
Maestro, I think we
should look for a hotel.

419
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,602
We only interfere here.
No, I would like to stay.

420
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,889
Why?
- The maid.

421
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,411
What is your name?

422
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,888
Charlotte.
- Charlotte as Carlotta?

423
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,082
Yes.
- Please call me Niccolo.

424
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:40,282
Do you want to show me the
city? It is so strange and big.

425
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,766
It is lonely, if you
constantly traveling.

426
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,766
I have a lot of work
and little free time.

427
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,448
When you're with me,
you can take your time

428
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,687
I do not know, what
are you out like, sir.

429
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,606
Delicate hands. Your work
does not seem to be hard.

430
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,411
Since we hardly know each
other, I would be grateful

431
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,321
if you would keep your hands with you.

432
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,962
Why you wear a ring?
- I am an opera singer.

433
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,122
Ah yes? You have to know

434
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,841
I have you already seen
- probably in Bologna?

435
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,688
Excuse me for a moment
- Magic! Yes, of course.

436
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,241
The you have seen?
- Of course.

437
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,161
Lamb stew with dumplings? Really?

438
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,811
You can not serve This stinks.

439
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,043
The cooking skills of Elizabeth.
What is he doing up there?

440
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,441
He makes himself comfortable and tries

441
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,881
Make friends with the maid.

442
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,929
What?
- Do not throw him in front of the.

443
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,807
He come too close to you?
- He should not try.

444
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,965
Even if he looks good,
, he is a vain peacock.

445
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,647
The disgusts me. Why do
we get involved with him?

446
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,362
I can not change it.
But you're doing fine.

447
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,643
Nevertheless, we need to
offer him something to eat

448
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,002
Good evening, gentlemen.

449
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,642
I need the services of an Italian chef

450
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,121
Your've got! Yourself exceeded.

451
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,284
This is truly a feast for the nose.

452
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,808
What the hell is that?
- Aglio e olio tagliatelle.

453
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,806
Since enough garlic in
it, to make me French.

454
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,645
Take it away. Take it away.

455
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,571
On, go back to your work.

456
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,648
* Noise *

457
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:56,522
Edible. Here you go.
You can serve it to him.

458
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,728
I think he would get
his food dear of you.

459
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,969
As much as I regret
it, I have no interest.

460
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,886
Do not be so hasty. Your
doing us all a service

461
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,368

ambition this household,

to experience intimacy with
the greatest genius of our time

464
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,604
If you want me as a whore,
so my price is much higher.

465
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,762
Yes, of course.

466
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,766
I ask to forgive me for this
presumption. Please. Please.

467
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,162
I bet you've never seen
anything so precious

468
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,650
Pathetic.

469
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,048
Perfection.

470
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,569
(Chanting) No mercy for rapists!

471
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,361
No asylum for devil
worshipers! Resist the wicked!

472
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,201
No mercy for rapists!

473
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,681
No mercy for rapists!

474
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,446
His music is certainly
better than yours.

475
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,450
Resist the wicked!

476
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,043
Hello. Time for the
sample waiting your coach.

477
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,528
No mercy for rapists!

478
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,682
No asylum
- DC he comes.

479
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,442
Outside is the press and
the rabble of the other day.

480
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,642
But we climb directly.

481
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,162
No asylum for devil worshipers!
- Get in,.

482
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,202
Is your appearance really
a guinea per square worth?

483
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,683
Gentlemen, it sounds a bit cumbersome.

484
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,682
It is not Beethoven.

485
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,287
No, not sure.

486
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:58,602
Could Signor Paganini not
honor us with a sample of

487
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,282
The concertmaster has a Guarneri.

488
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,842
I can see that too.

489
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,885
Mr. Watson.
- Yes, Mr. er Signor Paganini.

490
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,566
I have to interrupt.
- What can I do?

491
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:22,089
The instrument from the concert
master, I would like to play.

492
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,163
To Only. He ​​will
not break anything.

493
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,361
* He plays a musical scale. *

494
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,567
Thank you.

495
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,321
Sir, I do not care who you
are. Give me my instrument.

496
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,446
Mr. Paganini, what are you thinking?

497
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,767
Three boxes sold for the
Fifth And five for the Ninth.

498
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,366
Sparsely occupied parking. That was it.

499
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,009
Dozens of journalists outside
my door. Day and night.

500
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,721
Maybe it runs at the box office.

501
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,565
Did you read the "Times"?
- Not today.

502
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:25,202
"This brazen and arrogant Italians

503
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,249
has the general admission prices

504
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:30,762
A pound and raised a shilling.

505
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,283
We've heard that until now

506
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,727
only two boxes have been sold. "

507
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,611
Who wrote the If I could

508
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,286
Who ever you know it

509
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,200
Miss Langharn

510
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,366
This could help us out of trouble

511
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,723
The royal seal? Around the palace

512
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,330
I would also say, Mr. Watson

513
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:01,129
Nothing brings more people to the theater
than the recommendation of the King

514
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,931
Then I let play my magic powers

515
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,641
Good day, gentlemen Signore Paganini

516
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:15,290
Have you seen the seal
- Jaja

517
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,329
..?.?.. And how much he pays

518
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,891
It is an honor to play for
the King And good advertising

519
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:33,522
With the greatest
respect and deep regret

520
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,967
We have to turn down the invitation

521
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:40,241
No, no
- But His Majesty offers

522
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,802
a pretty box of honor
for our concert at.

523
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,721
No, you do not understand.
You can not refuse.

524
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,167
This is an invitation His Majesty.

525
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,962
If it is His Majesty,
, he can pay the price.

526
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,283
This is ridiculous!
We hardly sold tickets!

527

I think Mr. Watson wants me to stay.

539
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,168
John Watson deserves more respect

541
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,848

It consists of showmanship
And Your music is trivial.

551
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,646
You are a juggler. You do not practice.

Urbani, please tell the driver,
, he should make a city tour.

639

intense conversation.

I do not know how I could
make the situation worse?

651
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:56,401
I told the fiddler and his
companion, they should go.

If you still want them
serve food, then go ahead.

I want to clarify one
thing: I am not the maid.

655

704
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:06,010
Mr. Watson. The Maestro is a bit
sensitive on the day of the concert

705
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,811
It is not to annoy him the best.

706
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,566
I have to congratulate him, Mr. Urbani.

707
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:15,520
Signor Paganini, which was fabulous.
- Urbani, a coach.

708
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:20,090
Do you want somewhere?
You come back yet, right?

709
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,847
The drive to the theater is six clock.

710
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,765
There is oh so much traffic.

711
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,807
* You talk at once. *

712
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:33,962
Did he say where he wants to go?

713
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:48,127
Did you hear her sing Charlotte?
- However.

714
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,522
And?

715
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:58,404
For an unbiased ear it
sounds quite pleasing.

716
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,607
That's it?

717
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,846
I am polite.

718
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:47,045
Unwanted desires, by
the unscrupulous goings

719
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:50,647
to be incited the so-called virtuoso

720
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:55,727
as think of anything else
to their insatiable lust

721
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,282
And what has brought us?

722
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:02,729
The scourge of our age. The
evil scourge of epidemics.

723
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:07,290
The self-indulgence has
brought upon us the plague.

724
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:11,604
Get out of here! You should
come down to times correctly.

725
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,048
The hard you'd regret it.

726
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:18,285
Because I was brought by
such a charlatan basis.

727
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:22,365
And just wore this disease in his body.

728
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:26,088
My life is destroyed. Of
your yard not gone too.

729
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:30,081
Can I destroy you again?
- Can you mean?

730
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,726
Oh, it would be my feast.

731
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,800
Madam, I am pleased to see you again.

732
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:41,169
Do I know you?
- We met in front of the Sablonniere.

733
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,808
I cherish the greatest
sympathy for your cause

734
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:48,761
Thank you.
- Please, go a piece with me.

735
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:53,926
Do me the honor a
conversation in private.

736
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,847
* He whispers something. *

737
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,961
Lordsburg Hersh, sir.

738
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,407
What an honor that you are here today.

739
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:07,406
Let us listen to the
fiddling of Paganini.

740
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:15,401
So, you are supplied. This is
good. Distributes you all a bit.

741
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,650
Everyone gets a pin and a music book.

742
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:24,603
Behave unremarkable. But
trying to take down everything.

743
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,600
And if you can record everything

744
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:31,048
there will be a nice gift for you

745
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:33,641
I have to ask though!

746
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:40,041
So full it was never before.
Each lodge, occupied every seat.

747
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,400
Apart from the royal box, of course.

748
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:47,526
The I have kept for the king free.

749
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:50,206
Waiting outside a lot. Do we sell it.

750
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:54,410
If the king says he comes,
the courts must be free.

751
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,922
Even if he changes his mind

752
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:02,090
He ​​is now 10 minutes late.

753
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,408
Mr. Rogers, he's so far?

754
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,924
If I knew that.
- Then look after for heaven's sake.

755
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,127
If he's ready.

756
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:22,806
Yes, but how long does it take to yet?

757
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:29,409
Where is he?
- He is not there yet.

758
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,762
He does not answer.

759
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:36,403
What do I do now? A
Violin Violin Concerto no.

760
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:40,806
(Chanting) Paganini!

761
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:44,602
On the stage with you. But
let yourself plenty of time.

762
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,687
Not too fast. Not too fast.

763
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:54,887
I can not play without him

764
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:58,567
He has never shown us the
notes for the solo voice.

765
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:04,090
Break a leg. But let
yourselves this time.

766
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:08,361
Enjoy.

767
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:15,411
So, I has to get out now.

768
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,446
You bring him here. I'm
begging you. Get him.

769
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,327
Good luck.

770
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:30,003
* Applause *

771
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:47,126
* you begin to play. *

772
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,361
Where is he? I've already

773
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:18,450
What's going on?
- Do not panic. He's in there.

774
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:22,326
You already play. They
started with the overture.

775
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:25,967
He is in there? You do
not want to be disturbed.

776
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,323
What?
- You talk business.

777
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:31,371
Business? He ​​has
to play a concert.

778
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,847
Get him out.
- No. Impossible.

779
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:38,285
The concert has begun.
I should let no one.

780
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,647
No Niccolo!

781
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,241
Gently! Not at all.

782
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:03,365
* You play. *

783
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:35,002
Silence.

784
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,771
* Murmur in the audience *

785
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,682
yell. *

786
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:52,247
Screech from the audience '

787
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,526
Cheering and screaming *

788
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:03,686
* loud screech *

789
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:04,761
* bang *

790
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,726
* frenetic jubilation *

791
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,766
The king has arrived.

792
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:30,525
* He plays a version
of "God Save the King *

793
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:46,810
I leave you my violin for six pence

794
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:51,966
From what I've heard,
I could no longer touch.

795
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,968
Charlotte

796
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:06,408
Please Come sing with me adding

797
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,646
No, they do not want me They want you

798
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,121
That would be absurd
- Please

01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,042
Bravo
- Bravo!

800
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:52,929

talented Charlotte Watson

Sings an aria for you now.

802
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:05,210

805
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:05,285
Frenetic jubilation *

806

Bravo!

807
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:36,286
Apparently he is the new violin God.

808
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:59,926
Excuse me.
- Please, I want to listen.

809
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:04,529
I'm from the Times' I would
like to mention you praise

810
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:07,968
Oh
- May I ask a few questions

811
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,728
Of course, like

812
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:20,524
Madame Tussaud wants Paganini
likeness create wax?..

813
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:22,808
For a new figure Exhibition

814
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:25,122
In a room full of celebrities

815
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:27,806
it calls celebrities Cabinet

816
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:29,769
Very resourceful

817
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:32,406
Would you like to be portrayed

818
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:36,446
would be the very
exciting for a young girl.

819
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,927
I had on something no claim.

820
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:42,846
I just sang, because
the maestro asked me.

821
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:47,324
What type exactly your
relationship to Paganini?

822
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:51,610
Please?
- Well, he is your music teacher?

823
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:55,010
Uh, no.
- But he lodges in your house.

824
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:57,811
In my father's house, Miss
- Langharn.

825
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:01,248
Ethel Langharn. You're how old again?

826
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:03,687
I did not say.

827
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:06,566
Do you want to know something else

828
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:09,449
* Voices *

829
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:14,250
Caution! It will overwhelm you.
- Niccolo!

830
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:19,729
Niccolo!
- The ladies of the way.

831
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:27,886
Charlotte!
- Niccolo!

832
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,443
Out of the way!
- Niccolo!

833
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:50,405
Way here!
- But where is Niccolo?

834
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:55,049
You can not wait. He
​​will send for you.

835
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:01,166
Mr. Watson.
- Good evening, Mr. Urbani.

836
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:04,005
The concert was excellent, is not it?

837
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:06,970
However. Have you seen my daughter?

838
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:10,090
Sure is enjoying her fame.
- Probably.

839
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:13,722
We had a full house. You
did not want to believe me.

840
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:17,726
We were successful, yes.
Could I have our share?

841
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:22,169
Well, it's late. We can
settle tomorrow clean.

842
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:25,449
I have to find Charlotte
- Do not resent me,

843
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:29,087
if I ask you for immediate payment!

844
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:32,642
I have to collect everything.
You will then receive it.

845
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:35,208
Is this your cut?

846
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:37,961
This must be fairly shared.

847
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:40,566
I have to pay the orchestra

848
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:45,282
I understand. So we'll keep that.

849
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:51,001
And we will divide, perfectly just,

850
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:54,243
if we do the billing.
- Good evening.

851
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:58,691
Apologies. Excuse me, ladies.

852
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:03,444
I beg you. I have to get
in there Quiet. Calm down.

853
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:07,167
He's not in there. Has
anyone seen Charlotte?

854
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:09,561
Miss Langharn, You look gorgeous.

855
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:13,805
Signor Urbani, you are
as a fascinating man.

856
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:16,930
I do not know I
supposed to restrain you.

857
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:19,447
You are difficult to control.

858
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:23,287
That would require a woman of your size.

859
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:26,091
In whom you enter into temptation?

860
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:30,362
Wherever I am treated kindly.

861
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:35,167
Miss Langharn, you liked the Maestro?

862
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:39,410
The pleasure was somewhat
marred to to be honest.

863
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:41,921
What extent '?

864
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:46,364
Now, it was up to the girl I
thought they were pretty clueless.

865
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:50,409
She is young. It is How young exactly?

866
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:57,571
My lips are sealed.
- I had expected.

867
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:20,286
High with you! I have a
suite reserved Sablonniere.

868
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:24,570
Let us enjoy of your triumph.
- Not without Charlotte.

869
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:27,248
She was stunning.

870
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:30,330
It would be unwise
arrive there with her.

871
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:35,209
I let the young lady
align where to find us.

872
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:43,601
You were incredible.
- So what I've never heard of.

873
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:49,727
Urbani. I can not bear all the people.

874
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:52,770
Send them away.
- As you wish, Maestro.

875
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:54,843
Where is Charlotte?

876
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,561
I have sent for her It
is determined on the go.

877
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:07,844
You must now rely. The
Maestro needs to rest.

878
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:17,363
Thank you. Waits. Can you stay?

879
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:20,524
Signor Urbani. Does your love to me?

880
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:25,089
No, no. It is not to my pleasure.

881
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:34,443
The poor fellow thinks he was in love.

882
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:39,885
A wretched condition. Of
which he must be weaned.

883
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:43,649
And who is the object of his desire

884
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:46,685
A young, pretty child.

885
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,368
About Your stature, Your hair color.

886
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:56,402
Signor Urbani. Your plan fascinates me.

887
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:00,566
She is a virgin.

888
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,288
Maestro. She's here.

889
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,845
Charlotte?

890
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:29,406
Charlotte.
- Love.

891
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:05,160
Paganini's forbidden
love for a young girl.

892
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:19,684
Paganini's concert. His
forbidden love to a young girl.

893
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,286
Read all about it. Is the number 11?

894
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:24,169
Yes.
- Charlotte Watson?

895
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:27,967
Yes.
- A letter from Signor Paganini.

896
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:34,650
"Come quickly hotel
Sablonniere Suite 405

897
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:38,646
The newspaper reported today
of the shameful seduction

898
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,121
An innocent English girl

899
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:45,251
by foreigners Paganini.
She's still a child.

900
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:48,288
Can we sit idly

901
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:51,722
as such, hustle and
bustle corrupts our youth?

902
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:56,729
This music corrodes the
soul and destroyed our lives.

903
01:32:57,880 --> 01:32:59,848
This music decomposes the soul.

904
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:14,568
Miss Watson.

905
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:24,441
The Maestro's in there.

906
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:29,409
I let him know that you are here

907
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:44,287
He is the same.

908
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:01,648
Good morning.

909
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:14,641
What is going on here?

910
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:19,811
Is this your business? I
want you never see her again!

911
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:22,762
Charlotte, wait!

912
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:26,803
As you wish
- Wait!

913
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:32,284
Charlotte, wait! Charlotte, stops!

914
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:35,284
Let me explain it.
- This is obsolete!

915
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:38,125
This is a mistake
- Who are you?

916
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:40,328
Why do you give yourself
from with Urbani?

917
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:45,321
He gives me the blood in the veins
freeze! Remains of the Body of me!

918
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:48,205
Wait!
- There is the innocent child.

01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:55,444
And here comes the seducer!

920
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:58,450
Do you see how shameless
he is after her?

921

She's broken and humiliated!

923
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:08,645
He has ruined them! Then he left them!

924
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:14,986
The wrath of the English people
to chase him out of our country!

925
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:18,728
Charlotte!
- We Spank his ass!

926
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:22,282

Urbani! Urbani!

928
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:37,287
Urbani!

929
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:40,171
(Charlotte) Stop it!

930
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:44,048
Urbani! Italian scum!

931
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:50,085
Charlotte!
- Way here.

932
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:56,761
Let me explain it.

933
01:35:57,200 --> 01:36:00,363
Charlotte, let me explain.

934
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:09,081
Please, I beg you I have nothing please.

935
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:17,006
This is an outrage! This is an outrage!

936
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:20,607
Why do you imprison me? I am the victim!

937
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:23,366
It has attacked me for no reason!

938
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:34,323
Take care of him. He
​​raped a child.

939
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:41,087
What?
- That's not true.

940
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:43,129
Lies!
- A Mädchenschänder.

941
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:45,762
Lies.
- Oh yeah?

942
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:48,930
* Paganini screams in pain. *

943
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:52,169
An English girl to seduce.

944
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:56,522
Ah!

945
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:09,764
Charlotte.
- Papa!

946
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:13,123
Charlotte. It is, as you see, a lady.

947
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:15,203
As you can lock them up?

948
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:18,762
I am known. The press reports about me.

949
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:22,049
Come to me, my child,
out nothing happened.

950
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:30,406
How fast your are fallen from grace.

951
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:33,083
Urbani.

952
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:37,968
I am ready to forgive
you your disloyalty.

953
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:41,648
I prefer to let me beat a thousand times

954
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:46,164
Never again will I let
myself one with you.

955
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:49,688
My they have not really loved.

956
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:54,840
You loved this, what you saw in her.

957
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,207
Your innocence.

958
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:03,811
Someone whose purity you
redeemed of your many sins.

959
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:07,046
But she's made of flesh and blood.

960
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:09,401
Likewise, sensual and
ambitious as you are.

961
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:13,283
The upshot was predetermined.

962
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:17,171
Your she would have destroyed.

963
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:23,288
Corruption. With the
same glowing infection

964
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:26,808
seething in your blood.

965
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:34,571
I am not the devil.

966
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:37,651
I serve the devil.

967
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:40,770
And you are my master.

968
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:56,642
The bottle shatters. *

969
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:57,881
Are you okay?

970
01:39:58,040 --> 01:40:02,329
Do not you wanna maybe go to fresh air?

971
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:09,365
Paganini has made known, where he is.

972
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:12,047
Where is he? Was in the newspaper

973
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:14,083
that he is going to Vienna.

974
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:18,211
He has taken the first
ferry from Dover yesterday.

975
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:23,243
Come, my child.

976
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:25,847
Come here. It's all good.

977
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,844
All good. Come here.

978
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:37,850
Hello. Hello.

979
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:41,325
Achilles. Achilles!

980
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:44,166
Achilles, I'm back!

981
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:48,849
It's so nice to see you again

982
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:52,166
I've missed you so.

983
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:55,770
You have so missed you,
my little Achillino.

984
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:58,002
How was your teacher?
- Strict.

985
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:02,445
What have! learned? Mathematics?
- No, he hit me.

986
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:04,802
And he can not cook.

987
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:08,646
Are you telling me the truth?

988
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:17,327
On guard!
- Oh, Maestro. Oh, Maestro.

989
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:19,522
You hit my son?
- No.

990
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:22,843
You hit my son?
Disappears! Get out of here!

991
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,129
Power that your coming out! Get out!
- Maestro.

992
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:40,848
Charlotte, how are you?
Has Paganini wrote to you?

993
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:44,402
Will you see him again?
- Give an answer.

994
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:53,290
How can we end this lie?

995
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:58,164
Well. I could write a letter

996
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:03,922
Or we sue for libel. That
would cost 500 pounds.

997
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:07,886
We do not even five
pounds. To mention 500 full

998
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:10,611
We should live with it.
- To live?

999
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:15,090
I'm not Paganini whore.
- We know that, my child.

1000
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:18,524
We could consider as advertising.

1001
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:22,446
What?
- The hardest thing for an artist

1002
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:25,007
is to make his name known

1003
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:28,649
Yours is just across London known.

1004
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:32,731
You'll famous. Perhaps is
reported even in New York.

1005
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:36,282
In this way, I want to not be known.

1006
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:39,809
See how you can use the thing.

1007
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:42,964
Attempt to make the best of it

1008
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:46,171
You think of me speaks only envy.

1009
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:51,364
But I know what it is,
miss an opportunity.

1010
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:55,931
One that will never happen again
under certain circumstances.

1011
01:42:57,520 --> 01:42:59,443
What do you mean, Dad?

1012
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:04,880
Hm, Paganini is as famous as Napoleon

1013
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:08,366
Of this falls something from you.

1014
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:13,925
We could arrange for you solo concerts.

1015
01:43:20,240 --> 01:43:24,006
Such messages are quickly forgotten.

1016
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:59,049
"Dearest Charlotte,
because the excitement

1017
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:01,851
laid to our last meeting

1018
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,800
I could persuade you,
to rethink our situation

1019
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:11,524
and to accompany me on a
concert tour on the continent

1020
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:15,366
If we spend more time
and get to know us better

1021
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:18,689
I hope you can give me confidence.

1022
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:23,289
For I feel, between us is love.

1023
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:27,243
In order to secure my future,

1024
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:30,523
I opened the 'Casino Paganini " in Paris

1025
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:34,890
It is a noble Konzerthaus
with games and reading rooms

1026
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:37,930
If your kämt, would be a fabulous place

1027
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:40,760
for your debut in Paris

1028
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:50,445
There is not a day that I do not myself

1029
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:52,802
yearn after your loving glance

1030
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:55,725
After living, that you radiate,

1031
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:58,121
that fills me with hope

1032
01:44:58,280 --> 01:45:02,080
The feeling in me is
stronger than I can bear it

1033
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:05,050
It is completely new to me

1034
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:08,727
I implore you, to recognize my sincerity

1035
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:14,250
and to believe me that I
am you totally submissive. "

1036
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:21,850
(Charlotte) Dear Niccolo,
your offer has touched me.

1037
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,526

Without your inspiration it
would never have happened.

1041

the loss of a mortal. "

You have all invested in
the success of this company

1046

The church forbid Paganini
to be buried in Geweither soil
