No. We ain't stopping the car again.

43
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:36,907
We don't wanna stop.
We want to know, are we good boys?

44
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,867
Yeah, yeah, you're good boys.

45
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:41,495
All right, Toby, give them a piece of candy.

46
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:45,707
Thank you.

00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,301
I know.

00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,471
Now it is.

51
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,847
Yeah.

52
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,391
Thanks.

53
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:03,725
You're welcome.

54
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,994
You ain't gonna use that road, are you, Pop?

55
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,245
Why not?

56
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,997
Well, that sign says "closed to the public."

57
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,207
We ain't the public,
we're part of the government.

58
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:30,836
They send me checks.
I keep them busy and happy.

59
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,838
We're dependent on each other.

60
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,756
We ain't the public, Toby.

61
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,114
Damn it, I lost my traction.

62
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,866
Don't get upset, Pa, I'll lift her off.

63
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,451
You'll do nothing of the kind.

64
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,244
You're getting $63.80 a month

65
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,496
because the Army
totally disabled your back.

66
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,332
Now, how's it gonna look
if somebody comes along

67
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,708
and you're lifting up an automobile?

68
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,168
My back don't feel totally disabled.

69
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,086
It don't matter how your back feels,

70
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,464
it's what the Army doctor says that counts.

71
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:16,715
I keep telling you, Pop,

72
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,967
they examined me
right after my first judo lesson.

73
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,845
It was a little twisted up,
but it twisted back the next lesson.

74
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,181
- Toby, we'll get out.
- That's okay.

75
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,785
Didn't twist your back again, did you, son?

76
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,286
No, sir, I just used mostly my hands.

77
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,371
Good. Good.

78
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,623
I wonder where the road goes.

79
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,334
It's hard to tell,
just from looking at one end.

00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,472
Hey,POP?

82
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,807
Yeah, Holly?

83
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,725
Listen, I've been taking notice.

84
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,394
We haven't passed a house

85
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,313
or even a gas station the whole time
we've been on this road.

86
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,191
Well, it stands to reason.
It's a brand new road.

87
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,819
The country ain't caught up with it yet.

88
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,613
Doesn't your gas gauge read "empty"?

89
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,741
When my gas gauge says "empty,"

90
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,618
it's still got three gallons left in it.

(ENGINE SPUTTERING)

92
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,142
I can't understand it.

93
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,102
Where you going, son?

94
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,104
I'm gonna jog up the highway
and get some gasoline.

95
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,313
You gonna do nothing of the kind.

96
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,440
Why not?

97
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,316
One of those government
Highway Patrol wagons

98
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,734
is gonna come along here any minute.

99
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,738
Now, Pop, there won't be any patrolling
if this road doesn't go anywhere.

100
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,574
And why wouldn't this road
wanna go nowhere?

101
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,452
Maybe the government ran out of money
before they could finish it.

102
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,913
How many times do I have to tell you that
the government don't run out of money?

103
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,832
Only people run out of money.

104
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,208
Government's loaded.

105
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,211
Wake me up
when that truck patrols by here.

106
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,713
All right, Pop.

107
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,553
Gee, Toby, it's gonna be
getting dark in a couple of hours.

108
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,847
I don't see how we can prevent it.

109
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,683
I'm awful thirsty.
So are the children.

110
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:36,730
I'm sorry, Holly, but I don't happen to have
any drinking water on me right now.

111
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,900
I wonder what's keeping that patrol car?

112
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,946
- Toby.
- Yeah?

113
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,616
We could dig for some.

114
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,826
Well, there's always what you call
ground water,

115
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,620
and it doesn't mix with the salt water

116
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,581
so if you dig down to the water level,
you can get the fresh.

117
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,542
Well, another thing
I don't have on me is a shovel.

118
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,461
Why, it's soft ground.

119
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,838
All you need is sort of a scoop or something.

120
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:05,050
There ought to be something around here
we could use.

121
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,052
What about this?

122
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,137
No, not your pop's fender.

123
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,640
Oh, I'll put it back on before he wakes up.

124
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:24,319
TEDDY: I hit one.

125
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,946
- EDDY: You did not.
- I did so.

126
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,907
All right now, just keep throwing.
We need more coconuts.

127
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,077

EDDY: Hey, Pop, do you wanna try one?

130
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,958
POP: No, I don't wanna try one.

131
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,584
Keep hitting higher.

You're just as happy
as a house cat, ain't you?

134
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,053
Women like doing things for other people.

135
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,930
Don't men ever feel like that?

(CHUCKLES)

137
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,643
What did I say that was so funny?

138
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,144
Oh, nothing.

139
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,106
I was just remembering,
after your folks died,

140
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,816
when Pop took you in.

141
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,653
What a skinny, scrawny little thing
you were.

142
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,489
All eyes and elbows.

143
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,326
And now you're practically...

144
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,829
Well, like you said,
practically a woman.

145
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,166
- Toby.
- Yeah?

146
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,502
Will you look at me?

147
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,713
Mmm-hmm.

148
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,174
No, I mean real good.

149
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,015
I know you're a woman, Holly.

150
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:39,644
And I know I said "practically,"
and that bothers you, don't it?

151
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,357
Yeah, well, I am 19 years old

152
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,484
and I'm kind of well-built.

153
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,361
Yep, I know that, too.

154
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,530
And I'm glad of it.

155
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,908
- Are you, Toby?
- Uh-huh.

156
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,036
'Cause I'm trying
not to notice things like that

157
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,663
and you're a good one to practice
not noticing on.

158
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,333
Well, why me,

159
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,085
and, well, what's wrong with noticing girls?

160
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,087
Well, that's how they catch you.

161
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,591
Pop told me all about it
the day I got sent home from band practice

162
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,844
for grabbing Amy Plotka.
Do you remember Amy?

163
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,430
Yeah, I remember Amy.

164
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,726
You know anything about sex, Holly?

165
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,729
Of course I do.

166
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:24,898
Who told you?

167
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,276
I don't remember.

168
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,737
Never you mind.

169
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,074
You've been living with us since you was 13.

170
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,493
You know about it then?

171
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,536
Oh, Toby, leave me alone.

172
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,039
I'm sorry, honey,
I didn't aim to make you mad.

173
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,874
I was just trying to explain
what you asked me.

174
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,460
Well, then explain.
Don't ask questions.

175
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:49,589
Well, it's just like Pop said,
women are natural nesters.

176
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,009
Just look at the way
you took to nesting right here.

177
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:56,304
Cooking dinner and everything,
starting from scratch.

178
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:01,142
Well, I would dearly love to know
what's so awful about nesting?

179
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,813
It's just being married
and having a house.

180
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,272
Well, nothing.

181
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,608
Except doing it when you don't want to.

182
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,112
I think a man ought to be allowed
to wait till he wants to.

183
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,572
Women don't aim to let you wait.

184
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,368
That's why I use my education
against them.

185
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,994

Anytime some pretty gal
is standing around bothering me

188
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,002
I just close my eyes and I say,
one times one is one,

189
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:31,172
and one times two is two
and right on through the eights.

190
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:35,635
Most times I only have to get to the sixes
and they get disgusted and go away.

191
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,011
I can imagine.

192
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,597
Of course it don't do much good
if they hang on through the eights

193

'cause I forget the nineses.

when you say that you wanna wait,
do you want to?

Does that mean that
you don't wanna fall in love?

I've seen people fall into.

00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,913
about homesteading, don't you, Governor?

344
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:44,707
Well, we're homesteading
from the end of the thoroughfare

345
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,375
to the edge of the river.

346
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,128
Oh, homesteaders, eh?

347
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,506
Homesteaders!

348
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,010
Any public land can be homesteaded,
can't it?

349
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,805
Yes, sir. If they put up a roof and stay on it
for six months, they own it.

350
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,808
The boy's right, Governor.
Well, there's the roof.

351
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,940
They're on private property.
Would you get back a mite?

352
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,234
- They're trespassing.
- All right, officers, get off.

353
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:15,321
Respect private property at all times,
gentlemen, that's the law.

354
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:18,366
Well, justice has been rendered.

355
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,118
I'll see you later, Mr. King.

356
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,621
Let's move along.

357
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,332
- Take care of yourself, Governor.
- Thank you, sir.

358
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,836
Nice parade.

359
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,547
He's a nice fellow.

360
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,761
Give three cheers for Pop.
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!

361
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,054
Stop that, you brats.

362
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,098
- Brats.
- Who you calling brats?

363
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,101
I'll take care of it.
Run along and play, kids.

364
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,560
You gonna stand on our property

365
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,938
and you're gonna give orders
like you're entitled to?

366
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,942
That's a good idea.
Play it up while you've got the chance.

367
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,860
Oh, yes, there's a homestead law,

368
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:57,238
and you've taken good advantage of it.

369
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,156
But there's other laws, Kwimper,

370
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,201
laws that might cause you
a lot of unpleasantness.

371
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,953
Such as? Go ahead, quote them.

372
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,539
One, for instance, provides that none of you

373
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:10,376
receive any more welfare benefits
from your home state.

374
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,837
You're residents here now.

375
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,131
I shall so notify the proper authorities.

376
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,257
Pop.

377
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,426
Pop, do you want me to throw this fellow
off our property?

378
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,053
No, no, no, just leave him be.

379
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,888
We'll listen and we'll learn.

380
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:27,727
Learn this, too, then.
That well is probably unhygienic.

381
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:32,023
That lean-to doesn't conform
to any zoning restriction I know of.

382
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,108
Kwimper, I am proud of my job

383
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,277
and of my responsibility to the people.

384
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:40,114
I owe them my best efforts
to run your sort out of this area.

385
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,410
You'll be hearing from me shortly.
Come along, Joe.

386
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,331
Funny thing.

387
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:51,625
I was just about to give him back his land
when he turned nasty.

388
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,586
Now, I don't know what to do.

389
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:57,840
Pop, didn't you mean what you said
about homesteading and all?

390
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,800
But, damn it, I ought to stay here.

391
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,596
But it's an awful lot of botherjust to take
that uppity hyena down a peg.

392
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:05,723
- I gotta think it over, Tob.
- Well, Pop...

393
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,600
I gotta think it over, Tob.

394
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,811
Toby. Cross your fingers and pray.

395
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,648
Pray for what, Holly?

396
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,609
To homestead!

397
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,779
To stay here.
To stay here for always.

398
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,323
Why, that don't make a bit of sense to me.

399
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,033
What's wrong with our own home?

400
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,993
After Gertrude Patterson leaves, that is.

401
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,621
Well, it's not our home, it's your home.

402
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:31,957
But if we built a place here,

403
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,710
it would really be part mine,

404
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,797
and not just a place
I was allowed to move into.

405
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,758
Be my first real home.

406
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:46,764
I'm sorry, Toby,
if that sounds ungrateful.

407
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:51,268
That's natural, honey,
I mean, women are just natural nesters,

408
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,312
just like Pop said.

409
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,316
Toby, a body would think a grown man

410
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,443
could make up his own mind about things.

411
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,195
Well, I agree with you there.

412
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,197
I kind of like to make my own decisions, too,

413
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,991
but I usually wind up doing
what Pop wants anyway.

414
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,497
Don't you understand that I wanna stay?

415
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,958
I wanna stay so much.

416
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,130
I didn't realize it meant
that much to you, honey.

417
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,508
Just don't get upset about it. I'll fix it.

418
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:23,801
How?

419
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:27,888
You mean, you haven't learnt how to handle
a contrary man like Pop yet?

420
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,723
Watch this. Hey, Pop!

421
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,310
Pop!

422
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:34,979
Huh? Huh? Huh?

423
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,231
We'd better get out of here.

424
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,399
Who says?

425
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:41,277
That King fellow is gonna make
an awful lot of trouble.

426
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,904
<i>I'l</i>l break him off like a dry twig.

427
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,031
Well, maybe so, maybe not.

428
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,241
No maybe about it.

429
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,118
Well, it's just that me and Holly here,

430
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,578
we don't think you can handle a man

431
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:53,205
as big and powerful
as a highway supervisor.

432
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:58,127
Well, that settles it.
We're staying.

433
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,088
We're homesteading.
We ain't leaving here until I say so.

434
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,216
But, Pop, why,
how can we possibly manage?

435
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,510
How will we manage?
That's my department.

436
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:08,137

Toby, I could kiss you for that.

One times one is one.
One times two is two...

441
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,077
Wow! That's a monster.

442
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:35,331
Is it good to eat?

443
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:39,084
We ain't never gonna know.
He's too big to handle for this gear.

444
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:52,890
What do you got there, a tarpon?

445
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,351
I don't know,
but whatever it is, it's a whopper.

446
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,436
He's too big to catch with a diaper pin.

447

I'm trying to get rid of him

448
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,231
just as much as he's trying to get rid of me.

449
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:01,815
Trying to get rid of him?

450
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:05,027
I've been paying $65 a day for charter boats
and never hooked one like that.

451
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,112
I'd give $20 to play him.

Yep, and a couple of luxury items, too.

than with $1,000 worth of equipment.

The bait's free, hooks don't cost much.

515
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:02,371
You've given me an idea.

516
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,622
I have?

517
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,418
Oh, such a wonderful idea.

518
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,795
Oh, Toby, you're gonna be proud of me.

519
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:18,595
Sure you don't need anything else?

520
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,973
Nope, this is just fine.

521
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:24,184
Now, really,
there are fish out there by the millions.

522
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,687
Thanks for the information.
I'll pass it along.

523
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:29,732
- You do that. Bye.
- Bye.

524
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,030
MAN: Oh, it's a big one, ain't it?

525
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:38,782
You've got a beauty there, miss.

526
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,492
There's a beauty if I ever saw one.

527
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:41,785
Wish you had caught that, huh?

528
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:42,953
Anybody want any more coffee?

529
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,955
Two cups, one with, one without.

530
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,999
One with and one without.

531
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:48,667
Throw in a couple of donuts, please.

532
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:50,669
Couple of donuts.

533
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,139
More wood, Teddy.

534
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,474
Yeah, Pop.

535
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:13,400
TOBY: $89, $90,

536
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,903
$91.

537
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,572
$91.50.

538
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:19,907
- Is she asleep?
- Mmm-hmm.

539
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,950
$92, Pop.

540
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,452
$92.

541
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,496
Well, that's fine for one day, son.

542
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,623
That's what comes
of sticking up for your rights.

543
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,042
Not running like a scalded dog,
the way you wanted me to.

544
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:32,795
Oh, you was right, Pop.
I was wrong.

545
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:35,422
You know, we'd better start a bank account.

546
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,050
I've had nothing to do with no banks,
I ain't gonna start now.

547
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:42,513
Now, Pop, banks pay interest
and you double your money before you...

548
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,515
But I hate them.
Don't you, Toby?

549
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:46,600
I never even seen the inside of a bank.

550
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,352
I don't aim to.

551
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:54,066
I mean, I'm gonna make
a few improvements.

552
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,027
Lots, Pop.

553
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,905
What we first need
is a line of pilings offshore.

554
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,323
We do?

555
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,699
So we can build a dock.

556
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:04,076
A dock?

557
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:07,120
Let me handle this, Pop,
I understand her a little better than you do.

558
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,081
Now, what do we need a dock for, honey?

559
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:11,667
Silly, so we can tie up our rowboats.

560
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,210
Oh, rowboats.

561
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,755
We need a rowboat
so we can row out to our yacht, Pop.

562
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,092
Else how can we get out to that island
where our hotel is?

563
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:22,678
Now, will you two stop that?
I mean this.

564
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:26,223
We need rowboats so we can
rent them out to our fishing parties.

565
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,767
Right now,
our customers are fishing off of that bridge

566
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,144
and it belongs to the state highway.

567
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:35,107
Now how long is it before that Mr. King
is gonna put a stop to it?

568
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,526
- Be damned, but she's right.
- She is?

569
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,319
Well, of course I am.

570
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,946
So I talked to some folks,

571
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:43,699
and it figures out
we can get some used rowboats,

572
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:48,161
build a dock, and have
a real fishing place for about $2,000.

573
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:49,705
POP: $2,000?

574
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,331
TOBY: You done busted a bubble, honey.

575
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,625
No, I've been asking around.

576
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,170
There's a very good chance
we can borrow the money from the bank.

577
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,882
Well, that would sure change
my opinion about banks.

578
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,551
You mean they'll lend you
the moneyjust for the asking of it?

579
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,011
And the interest.

580
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,972
You gotta pay them back a little more
than they pay out.

581
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:08,140
Oh!

582
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,475
That's how they do it.

583
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:12,436
Yeah, Pop.

584
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:16,857
Well, will you go?
Will you go to the bank and borrow $2,000?

585
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,567
Well, if it's that easy, let Toby do it.

586
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,693
You mean me?

587
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,695
Holy Ike, here I am dealing with banks,

588
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,947
got my own fleet of rowboats,
my own docks,

589
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:25,365
all because I wouldn't
let some government man

590
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,826
tell me where I could stand
and where I couldn't.

591
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,412
It seems there's a lot of money
in not doing what you're told, Pop.

592
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,623
Yes, sir. Teddy, Eddy,
let that learn you.

593
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:35,375
If you want to get along in life,
never do what you're told.

594
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,753
Oh, for heaven's sakes,
don't tell them a thing like that.

595
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,756
It ain't no wronger than telling them
they always gotta take orders.

out on the new highway.

Oh, well, I'm sorry.
lthoughtyouu.

687
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:43,910
All right, guard,
open up the doors, please.

688
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:45,120
It's all right, folks.

689
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,538
Nothing to be frightened about.

690
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:49,040
Just a mistake, everything will be all right.

691
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,458
Toby, are you all right?

692
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,210
Yeah, I'm all right, Holly.
I'm all right.

693
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:53,378
Hello, Mr. Endicott.

694
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,504
Hello, dear.

695
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,798
Well, maybe you can
tell me what this is all about?

696
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,967
I don't know.
ltjust seemed to happen all at once.

697
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,719
Well, Mr. Binkley yelled for help and...

698
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:01,970
No, I didn't.

699
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,972
George, remember you're a vice president.

700
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,932
Please get off the depositors' table.

701
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,018
Well, I didn't yell for help.

702
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,185
Toby did.

703
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:10,520
Well, I thought he was sick.

704
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,564
This man broke into the bank vault...

705
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:14,816
I understand, guard.
Here's your gun.

706
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,318
Just go about your business.

707
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:17,694
Yes, sir.

708
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,905
Well, let's get down to fundamentals.

709
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:25,076
Now, young lady, what are you
and this gentleman doing in our little bank?

710
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,245
We want to borrow $2,000.

711
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,247
Please.

712
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,459
Well, you went to the right person.

713
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:34,878
George here is our loan officer.

714
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,088
Could we have the money right now, sir?

715
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,591
You see, the parking meter
is running outside...

716
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:43,219
Well, Toby,
we don't do things quite that fast here.

717
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,972
Why don't we come to my office?

718
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,516
I think George needs to sit down.

719
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,602
Well, come along.
Come along, George.

720
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:57,859
So if we can get the dock
and the boats and the outboard motors,

721
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:01,738
we could rent them,
make a lot of money, and build a house.

722
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:04,616
Well, George here is the man
you're gonna have to convince.

723
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,201
You frightened him to death,

724
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,286
now it's his turn to frighten you.

725
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:12,791
Mr. Kwimper, the bank must have security,

726
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:16,669
well, that is to say that we have to be sure
that we'll get our money back.

727
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,129
Now, this is Mrs. Kwimper?

728
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,465
Oh, no, sir. She just lives with me.

729
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:22,926
Oh.

730
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,345
Well, I didn't mean to pry.

731
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:28,640
I think you're getting
the wrong impression, George.

732
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:31,267
How long have you lived
with the Kwimpers?

733
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:35,063
Since I've been about 13.
Toby's Pop took me in

734
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,149
for the same reason he took in
Ariadne and the twins.

735
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,526
We had no place to go.

736
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,737
Get the picture, George?

737
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:44,114
Oh, thank you.

738
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:47,909
Yes. Yes, sir.
Now, this land that you're living on,

739
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,036
well, is it mortgaged?

740
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,247
I don't know, sir.
We don't own it.

741
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,165
We're homesteading.

742
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,459
Well, we can't very well lend you money

743
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:58,711
on property you don't own yet.

744
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,463
Well, we own ourjohn.

745
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,883
I didn't quite catch that.

746
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:08,513
Ourjohn, and I guess we own the house
that we built for it, too.

747
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:13,768
Yes. Well, let's move on here, shall we?

748
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:16,062
Now, how about your car?

749
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:20,525
Well, that car means an awful lot to Pop
even though it only cost $50.

750
00:39:21,151 --> 00:39:22,986
Besides, it's got fried hubcaps.

751
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,281
Of course.

752
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,242
Well, George, you've got to admit
he's been giving you honest answers,

753
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,202
not cagey ones, but honest.

754
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:34,622
A week ago
he refused to take $20 for a public fish.

755
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:38,251
That's very commendable.
I think that... How is that?

756
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,170
It doesn't really matter.

757
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:43,047
I happen to have
a very high opinion of honesty.

758
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,925
Well, yes, sir, of course.

759
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,510
But is it security?

760
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:53,266
It just might be that this is
the only real security there is.

761
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:57,687
Well, sir, I became
a vice president of this bank

762
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:01,065
because I made it a habit
never to contradict the boss.

763
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:07,030
This bank is about to lend you $2,000.

764
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:12,035
We're very grateful, sir,
but I don't want to try to fool anybody.

765
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,829
Now that car of Pop's is in a terrible mess.

766
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,206
It doesn't matter, Toby.

767
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,958
What we're making is known
as a character loan.

768
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:23,129
We do it now and then, but not
often enough for the good of our souls.

769
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:26,424
Don't you agree, George?

770
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:28,968

Does the memo imply
they've broken the law?

788
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,940
I don't recall making any such statement.

I'll have to interview them.

I'd misrepresent this situation?

What is this?

855
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,709
This punk threw acid on my hand.

856
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:14,420
You'd better watch it, Carmine, that dame,
she slashed me with a knife.

857
00:45:14,504 --> 00:45:16,297
I never did anything of the kind.

858
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,632
All right, hold it you two.
Put a flash on them.

859
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,509
Look, we're just trying to be neighborly.

860
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:23,095
I'm sorry you fellows got hurt,
but you done it to yourselves.

861
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,890
A pot of coffee and a can opener.

862
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:28,601
A couple of great muscle men you are.

863
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,186
Holly here made you some coffee.

864
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,312
Would you like to try some?

865
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:34,190
Sure thing.
You two must be from next door.

866
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,483
Yeah, glad to meet you.

867
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,609
Pleased to meet you.

868
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,904
Would you like to come inside,
meet my partner, Nick?

869
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:44,242
If you put some butter on it,
it'll take the sting out of it.

870
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:45,910
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

871
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:48,871
What's that?

872
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:49,997
What's what?

873
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,667
Well, Holly ain't never been nowhere.

874
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,585
That's a pool table, honey.

875
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,004
First one I ever seen
without pockets, though.

876
00:45:57,088 --> 00:46:01,259
Yeah, well, you just cover the bet
and make yourself some easy money, Sam.

877
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:02,593
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

878
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:08,057
What did you do, send out for something?

879
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,351
No, Nick, these people are from next door.

880
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,228
They brought us some coffee.

881
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,855
Coffee? What for?

882
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:15,106
You drink it.

883
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:18,943
Is he kidding?

884
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:21,153
I don't think so. He's like that.

885
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:23,781
Well, Toby and I just
like to be neighborly, that's all.

886
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,658
Sure, do you want me to pour you a cup?

887
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:29,036
No, no, no, bud, look,
we're not neighbors.

888
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,580
This is a floating game, see?

889
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,832
We just stick around
in one place until it gets too hot.

890
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:34,500
Then we move along. Get it?

891
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:37,211
Oh, sure. Well, they tell me
it don't get hot around here

892
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:39,463
till about the middle of July.

893
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:44,176
He is like that, ain't he?

894
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:48,222
No, you see, it gets hot
for us anyplace we go after a couple of days.

895
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:51,767
Well, if it gets hot anyplace,
what did you come here for?

896
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:53,644
Well, it was on the way.

897
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:56,898
Oh, then you're not just running away
from the government.

898
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:58,274
What was that?

899
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,234
Well, Toby thinks maybe you

900
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:03,112
saw that piece in the paper
about there being no government.

901
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,739
No, what kind of government?

902
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,491
Well, it said that
the State built this here land

903
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:11,203
and the county ain't
got no say-so over it, the city neither.

904
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:14,498
Hey, could this be on the level?

905
00:47:14,624 --> 00:47:17,376
You know, it sounds screwy enough,
it could be kosher.

906
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,587
That's what it sounds like to me.

907
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,882
Oh, baby, this kind of a chance
comes along once in a lifetime.

908
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:26,260
Carmine, you know this could turn out
to be an East Coast Las Vegas.

909
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:28,638
Oh, you mean
because there's no police here?

910
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:30,097
Now you're digging it, little lady.

911
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,224
Yes, but what about after we file?

912
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,060
- File what?
- Our claim.

913
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:37,063
Once we've lived here for six months,
we can claim the land.

914
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:39,815
Pop says that it'll be part of the county then.

915
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:43,069
Well, this land claiming idea
don't sound too good.

916
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,363
Now, I bet it would
if Pop explained it to you.

917
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:48,532
Yeah, well, where is he?
In that woodpile next door?

918
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:51,410
Well, he wasn't in the woodpile
when we left. He was...

919
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,580
Well, let's visit him anyway.
After you, please.

920
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,082
Thank you, sir.

921
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:57,583
(CHUCKUNG)

922
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:00,962
Oh, baby, is this a sweet deal?

923
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:03,714
Carmine, nobody's gonna mess it up.

924
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:05,967
You're not planning any rough stuff?

925
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:08,010
We do it nice if we can.

926
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:14,183
Now, your kid here tells me
you're gonna put in a claim for this land?

927
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:15,977
That's about the size of it.

928
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,313
Well, that would be a big mistake.
Bring the cops here.

929
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:22,441
Right nice of you to warn us
but I know all about it.

930
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:25,903
Well, I like to do things nice if I can.

931
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:31,450
Now there's $2,000.
Carmine and me want to buy your place.

932
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,035
Oh, no, you can't...

933
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,704
We ain't gonna sell.

934
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:38,541
We got $2,000 in this
without counting the brainwork.

935
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,628
All right, <i>I'l</i>l make it $5,000 and the
government will give you capital gains.

936
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,255
Don't mention the government to me.

937
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,049
I tried to help the government out
with everything they wanted to do.

938
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:50,136
With relief, with compensation,
with disability.

939
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:51,429
They cut me off.

940
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:53,014
Well, if that's the way they feel about it,

941
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:55,599
don't mention the government to me.

942
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,060
(SIGHS)

943
00:48:58,144 --> 00:48:59,729
He's your father?

944
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:00,855
That's my POP-

945
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,523
Sure, that figures.

946
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:05,818
All right, <i>I'l</i>l go a little higher,
but don't push it too high.

947
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:09,321
Well, if Pop says we don't sell, we don't sell.

948
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,615
You don't sell?

949
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:19,290
Well, I tried to do it nice.

950
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:58,245
There it is, Alisha.

951
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:01,791
A perfect example
of how a tenement slum commences.

952
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:03,918
Which one is the Kwimper's?

953
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,878
The hideosity with the dock.

954
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,131
What about the rest of the homesteaders,

955
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:10,674
you plan to get rid of those, too?

956
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,843
I certainly am. One way or another,

957
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:15,179
once you've got rid of the Kwimpers.

958
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:17,014
How long will it take you?

959
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:20,184
Well, Arthur,
it's not going to be any quick thing.

960
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:22,728
The State Welfare requires
a complete list of interviews

961
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:24,563
with everybody concerned.

962
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:27,817
Very well. Start interviewing.

963
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:30,194
How long has he been here?

964
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:33,531
It doesn't matter.
He's got the IQ of a grasshopper.

965
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:38,244
Well, with those shoulders,
he sure looks like a genius to me.

966
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:40,204
Introduce me, Arthur.

967
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:49,463
Kwimper, this is Miss Alisha Claypoole.

968
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:51,882
She is our State Welfare supervisor.

969
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:54,552
- Oh, how do, ma'am?
- Oh, stay right where you are.

970
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:56,512
- You can go now, Arthur.
-But...

971
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:58,264
Thank you, Arthur.

972
00:50:58,389 --> 00:50:59,557
Hmm.

973
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:01,642
- What's your first name?
- Toby.

974
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:02,768
Mine's Alisha.

975
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:05,604
- Well, how do, Alisha?
- Oh, please relax.

976
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:09,275
Did you understand what Arthur King
meant when he mentioned your IQ?

977
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,735
I reckon he meant I'm not smart.

978
00:51:11,861 --> 00:51:13,237
I hope he didn't hurt your feelings.

979
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,321
No, ma'am.

980
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,240
There's a couple of things I am smart about,

981
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:18,868
and one of them's not letting my feelings
get hurt easy.

982
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:21,245
That's smart. That's even wise.

983
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,457
Anybody ever tell you
you're very handsome?

984
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:26,959
Only girls.

985
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:29,170
Don't you like girls?

986
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:32,965
I like girls all right,
except when they start to bother me.

987
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:34,758
A young, virile man like you,

988
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:36,927
I should think you'd love to be bothered.

989
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,512
Well, the bothering part is all right,

990
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:40,181
but I ain't gonna marry no girl

991
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:43,392
and build no house
just so I can be bothered regular.

992
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:47,563
Flight from paternity.
Oedipus is everywhere.

993
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,857
I beg your pardon, ma'am?

994
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,192
Nothing.

995
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,737
You know, Toby,
that the State Welfare Department

996
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,405
is deeply interested in you.

997
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:57,781
How come?

998
00:51:58,282 --> 00:51:59,950
'Cause you're a very interesting man.

999
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:01,452
I am?

1000
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:04,747
You have exquisite proportions,
why, your legs are amazing...

1001
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,248
That tickles, ma'am. That tickles.

1002
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:08,167
That's because I hit
a very sensitive nerve that...

1003
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:09,960
(CLEARING THROAT)

1004
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:13,339
If you have finished tickling Toby's leg,
I'd like him to do a chore.

1005
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:15,257
Who would this be?

1006
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:16,467
That's Holly.

1007
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:19,595
Hello, Holly.
Say "how do you do" to Alisha.

1008
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,348
A member of the Kwimper family?

1009
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:25,059
Oh, Holly's practically a sister to me.

1010
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:26,644
What does practically mean?

1011
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:28,312
We're not related.

1012
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:31,398
Alisha here is a State Welfare supervisor.

1013
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:32,691
That's lucky.

1014
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:36,153
Somebody's welfare
around here needs supervising.

1015
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:38,572
Come and help me fill the water barrel.

1016
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:40,491
I just filled it last night.

1017
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:43,410
Well, it fell over.
I think the twins must have pushed it.

1018
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:46,330
Look, that barrel weighs
200 or 300 pounds, Holly.

1019
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:48,249
The twins couldn't have turned it over.

1020
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:49,750
Maybe they had a little help.

1021
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,086
I'll fill it for you later, honey.

1022
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,754
Much later.

1023
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:56,715
Right now,
Alisha's got to figure out my welfare.

1024
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:03,847
I've never seen Holly look so upset.

1025
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:05,516
She must be awful thirsty.

1026
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:10,813
Toby, look at me.

1027
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,819
You know, total naivetÃ©
is a hard thing to believe.

1028
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,071
But I believe it.

1029
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,865
What did you say, ma'am?

1030
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:24,201
Never mind, it's a compliment.

1031
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:25,619
Oh. Thank you.

1032
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:28,205
I'll give you one,
just as soon as I can make one up.

1033
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:31,709
Can't you think of a compliment
without making it up?

1034
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:33,752
Well...

1035
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,214
Try.

1036
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,426
Try real hard.

00:53:45,014 --> 00:53:47,266
how are the fish running today?

This is about as private as a subway.
Come with me.

00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,358
I ain't got any secrets.

1044
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:59,987
Well, we just can't have
a good interview with people intruding.

1045
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,113
Oh.

You comfortable?

1048
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:22,843
Yes, ma'am.

1049
00:54:23,052 --> 00:54:24,094
Oh, I see.

1050
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,346
You need another pillow?

1051
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:27,389
No, this is fine, thank you.

1052
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:31,727
Well, Toby,
I need to know my subject inside out,

1053
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:35,022
every intimate detail
in order to prescribe help.

1054
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,982
I didn't know you was fixing to help me.

1055
00:54:37,066 --> 00:54:38,859
Seeing you're friends to Mr. King and all.

1056
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,277
Oh, don't worry about Arthur King.

1057
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:42,237
State Welfare wants to help you.

1058
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:44,615
That's what the word
"welfare" means, isn't it?

1059
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:47,159
Yes, ma'am. I never said it didn't.

1060
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:50,996
Well, let's start
with the word association test.

1061
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:54,958
I'll say a word and you say
the first word that pops into your head.

1062
00:54:55,084 --> 00:54:58,295
Well, wouldn't it be safer
if I give it a little thought, first?

1063
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:01,465
No, this is a test to
probe your subconscious.

1064
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,675
We all know our motives
on the conscious level

1065
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:06,136
and those are the ones
we often try to conceal.

1066
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:07,763
Now, if you answer me right away,

1067
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,765
I'll know the motives
you're trying to conceal.

1068
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:13,352
And I'll know the real reasons
for the things you do and say.

1069
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:14,561
Oh.

1070
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,690
Now, I got to think about that a little bit.

1071
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:21,985
Are you ready?

1072
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:23,487
Yep. Should I stand up?

1073
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:25,322
Oh, no, no, just relax.

1074
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:30,494
Now, first word,

1075
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:33,330
hurt.

1076
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,498
Ow.

1077
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:39,378
Well, I don't think that's a word.
Doesn't matter.

1078
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:42,005
Second word. Ready?

1079
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:45,050
- Help.
_"Helpll?

1080
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:48,220
No, Toby, you don't repeat the word,

1081
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,556
you just say what the word suggests to you.

1082
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:53,684
Nobody yells "help."
They always yell "help, help."

1083
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:55,436
So I was waiting for the other "help,"

1084
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:58,522
and when you didn't say "help,"
well, I said "help."

1085
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,315
I see.

1086
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:03,485
This isn't going to be
quite as easy as I expected.

1087
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:06,029
Now, the third word.

1088
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,198
Steal.

1089
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:09,533
Home.

1090
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:14,329
Oh, you poor boy. You think
somebody's trying to steal your home.

1091
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:16,206
Willie Mays stole home.

1092
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:18,375
Who's Willie May?

1093
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,336
Not May, Mays. He's a baseball player.

1094
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:24,339
Oh, never mind.
The association speaks for itself.

1095
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,925
Now, number four.

1096
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,262
Girl.

1097
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:32,848
Dad.

1098
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,476
Holy Moses.

1099
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:36,685
Something wrong?

1100
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:40,939
Toby, I'll just have to ask you
to explain that one for me.

1101
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,358
That's the song they're playing.

1102
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:49,239
<i>On top of Old Smoky

1103

<i>Where girls are a problem

1104
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:00,918

Any more words?

1129
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:46,023
Yes. Love.

1130
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:47,858
Thirty.

1131
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:50,527
You think love begins at 30?

1132
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:53,363
No, ma'am.
Love is when you ain't got any.

1133
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:55,866
Any what?

1134
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:58,410
Any points. Like in tennis.

1135
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:02,372
Love-15, love-30, love-40.

1136
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,791
Maybe I should've said love-15,

1137
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:06,752
but it ain't what I thought of.

1138
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:10,714
That's all right.
I just misunderstood you.

1139
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:13,842
Now the last word.

1140
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,011
Sex.

1141
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:18,472
One times one is one, one times two is two,

1142
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,307
one times three is three...

1143
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,726
Fascinating answer. Fascinating.

1144
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,853
Did I pass the test?

1145
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:29,107
What you just did spontaneously
was express the realization

1146
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:33,737
that with one person, or one of any species,
sex is a sterile thing.

1147
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:38,200
That can't produce more than
the original number that it started with.

1148
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:43,580
But as soon as there are two,
it becomes productive.

1149
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:47,459
Yes, ma'am. And that's
something you have to watch out for.

1150
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,920
Toby, don't spoil the poetry of it.

1151
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:55,717
Oh, well,
that's enough work for this afternoon.

1152
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:59,429
Let's just lie back
and enjoy the afternoon sun.

1153
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:07,896
Do you like me like this, Toby?

1154
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:09,564
You're awful close.

1155
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:13,527
Toby, just put your arm around me

1156
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:17,072
and do whatever you think of,

1157
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:19,157
just like you did in the test.

1158
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:23,829
I didn't know the government
gave this kind of test.

1159
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:25,288
Toby.

1160
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:36,258
Now.

1161
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:40,721
One times one is one,
one times two is two,

1162
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:44,391
one times three is three,
one times four is four...

1163
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:45,809
HOLLY: Toby!

1164
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:48,437
Toby, where are you?

1165
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:49,563
That's the end.

1166
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,022
No, that's Holly.

1167
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:55,610
Toby, you've gotta come home right away.

1168
01:00:55,694 --> 01:00:57,112
What happened?

1169
01:00:57,779 --> 01:01:00,115
Somebody opened the bait box.

1170
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:02,617
Now, who'd do a fool thing like that?

1171
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:04,870
Holly and I know, don't we, Holly?

1172
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,788
Well, come on,
we've got customers waiting.

1173
01:01:06,872 --> 01:01:10,083
Okay. How did you happen to find us, Holly?

1174
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:12,085
Well, I just saw you turn off the highway

1175
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:14,838
and I followed the dirt road
till the tire tracks stopped.

1176
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:16,631
Smart girl. Good tracking.

1177
01:01:16,715 --> 01:01:18,175
Just like an Indian squaw.

1178
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,552
Well, at least we finished the test.

1179
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:21,887
I'm sorry I got to go, Alisha.

1180
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:23,472
Just as well.

1181
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:26,975
- I'll be with you in a minute, Toby.
- Okay.

1182
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:29,519
Miss Claypoole.

1183
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:30,687
Yes?

1184
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:34,024
I don't like being called a squaw.

1185
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:43,408
Did I hear a splash?

1186
01:01:43,492 --> 01:01:44,910
Your friend went swimming.

1187
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:46,369
Oh, I see.

1188
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:47,746
Swimming?

1189
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:48,914
Yeah.

1190
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:07,724
- Holly.
- Yeah?

1191
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:11,186
What word would you say
if I were to say a word

1192
01:02:12,521 --> 01:02:14,189
like "boys"?

1193
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:16,650
I wouldn't say anything.

at that test than I done then.

- Were you really?
- Yep.

they said if it's too noisy, they'd buy us out.

they threw dead fish in our water barrel,

really interested in, Sheriff,

than close up at 11:00.

a more sensible arrangement

some of the things a sheriff runs up against.

1352
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:53,064
First, don't you have a gun or a club?

1353
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:54,774
Oh, I don't see no need for it.

1354
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:56,276
I figure if a man
is going to be a peace officer,

1355
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:59,028
he shouldn't go around looking un-peaceful.

1356
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:01,197
No gun, no club.

1357
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:03,533
But I can wrestle.
I can wrestle real good, though.

1358
01:10:03,658 --> 01:10:06,327
Yeah, but suppose someone
sneaked up behind you?

1359
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:09,330
Yeah. And grabbed your arms like this.

1360
01:10:09,414 --> 01:10:12,083
And another one was in front of you
and he had a sap like this.

1361
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,252
And he wrapped it around his wrist like this.

1362
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:15,420
You'd be helpless, wouldn't you?

1363
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:17,463

1707
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:15,707
You're like every department jackass
I ever knowed.

1708
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:17,709
You do nothing for a single, solitary soul,

1709
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:19,336
and that is because you're pretending

1710
01:28:19,419 --> 01:28:20,879
you're doing something for everybody.

1711
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:22,214
For the public.

1712
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:26,134
Who do you think the public is
but me and him and her?

1713
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:28,887
God, please turn your head away.

1714
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:32,641
And you and you.
Now get out of here and leave us alone.

1715
01:28:32,766 --> 01:28:36,103
- But don't you...
- Don't argue with him, Arthur. Let's go.

1716
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:48,990
Some mighty fine talking, Pop.

1717
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:53,161
I'd have done better to save
my gums for tomorrow.

1718
01:28:53,370 --> 01:28:55,872
We'll get the kids back, won't we, Pop?

1719
01:28:56,790 --> 01:28:58,792
I ain't gonna lie to you, Holly.

1720
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:00,877
I'm worried, I'm right worried.

1721
01:29:18,562 --> 01:29:20,313
BAILIFF: Everybody, please rise.

1722
01:29:31,491 --> 01:29:33,535
This is a hearing based on a request

1723
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:35,912
by the Department of Public Welfare

1724
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:39,374
for a court order, giving the Department
control and guardianship

1725
01:29:39,499 --> 01:29:41,877
over these three children I see here.

1726
01:29:43,211 --> 01:29:45,839
Mr. Kwimper,
are you represented by counsel?

1727
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:48,758
Come again, Judge?

1728
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:50,886
Have you got a lawyer?

1729
01:29:51,011 --> 01:29:54,097
No, sir. Don't believe in them. Never did.

1730
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:56,725
- Don't you indeed?
- No, sir.

1731
01:29:57,893 --> 01:30:00,437
Well, suit yourself.

1732
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:02,606
Thank you, Judge.

1733
01:30:02,731 --> 01:30:07,068
Now then, since this is
a hearing and not a trial,

1734
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:10,030
let's keep it simple and informal.

1735
01:30:10,113 --> 01:30:11,698
Miss Claypoole, would you start us off.

1736
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:13,575
Thank you.

1737
01:30:14,743 --> 01:30:18,038
Your Honor, the Department
of Public Welfare is charged

1738
01:30:18,121 --> 01:30:22,042
with the responsibility of ministering
to the well being of all its citizens.

1739
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:24,085
Particularly those of its children.

1740
01:30:24,211 --> 01:30:28,006
The cases of these three children have
caused the Department deep concern.

1741
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:29,424
Why, the twins live in a home

1742
01:30:29,549 --> 01:30:32,886
that is hardly more than a breeding ground
for delinquency and crime.

1743
01:30:32,969 --> 01:30:37,349
The Kwimper adults are immoral,
defiant of authority,

1744
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:39,893
and strongly suspected
of illicitly obtaining funds

1745
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:41,645
from government agencies.

1746
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:45,815
And they are also known
to have associated closely with gangsters.

1747
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:49,361
I shall document each of these charges
when the time comes.

1748
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:53,156
As part of our proof that the Kwimpers
are unfit to raise children,

1749
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:57,160
I shall ask Mr. King to report
on his dealings with the Kwimper family.

1750
01:30:59,788 --> 01:31:03,750
By taking advantage of a technicality,
Your Honor,

1751
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:06,211
these people set their own interests

1752
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:08,838
above those of six million taxpayers.

1753
01:31:09,631 --> 01:31:11,383
When I tried to persuade the Kwimpers

1754
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:14,803
to abandon their antisocial point of view,

1755
01:31:14,928 --> 01:31:16,972
I received nothing but abuse,

1756
01:31:17,681 --> 01:31:21,184
in the course of which,
the elder Kwimper boasted

1757
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:23,687
that he habitually received relief funds

1758
01:31:23,770 --> 01:31:26,064
as well as aid to dependent children.

1759
01:31:26,773 --> 01:31:30,277
I later learned that Toby Kwimper
served in the Army

1760
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:34,823
where he tricked the doctors into
awarding him a total disability allowance.

1761
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:38,577
I use the word "tricked" advisedly.

1762
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:40,745
I can prove that he suffers

1763
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:44,499
from no physical disqualifications at all.

1764
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:46,543
Anything more?

1765
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:48,878
Quite a lot, Your Honor.

1766
01:31:49,379 --> 01:31:51,089
The Department should like to point out

1767
01:31:51,172 --> 01:31:52,966
that the Kwimpers have no legal status

1768
01:31:53,049 --> 01:31:54,801
as guardians for these children.

1769
01:31:54,884 --> 01:31:59,097
Moreover, the Kwimpers
encouraged two notorious gangsters

1770
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:02,058
to set up a gambling establishment
in their neighborhood.

1771
01:32:02,183 --> 01:32:05,353
Subsequently, the Kwimpers
quarreled with the gangsters,

1772
01:32:05,478 --> 01:32:07,272
burned down their establishment,

1773
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:09,399
and finally drove them out at gunpoint.

1774
01:32:10,358 --> 01:32:13,361
Yes, I heard something about that.
Frightening.

1775
01:32:13,486 --> 01:32:14,696
Terrible.

1776
01:32:15,196 --> 01:32:18,116
So is the fact that an unmarried girl

1777
01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:20,910
by the name of Holly Jones
lives with the Kwimpers

1778
01:32:21,036 --> 01:32:23,997
in a relationship that I would
not care to explore.

1779
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,206
Goodness.

1780
01:32:26,916 --> 01:32:28,960
What a terrible thing to say.

1781
01:32:29,044 --> 01:32:32,714
Be quiet. You will have an opportunity
to answer the charges.

1782
01:32:34,215 --> 01:32:36,176
One final point, Your Honor.

1783
01:32:36,718 --> 01:32:38,303
As a qualified psychologist,

1784
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:41,056
I gave Toby Kwimper
a word association test

1785
01:32:41,181 --> 01:32:44,059
which is designed to
reveal basic motivations.

1786
01:32:44,893 --> 01:32:47,020
It was during the process of giving this test

1787
01:32:47,103 --> 01:32:50,106
that I was attacked
and knocked down by Miss Jones.

1788
01:32:51,941 --> 01:32:55,111
And you people claim
that you don't need a lawyer?

1789
01:32:56,071 --> 01:32:57,864
What did the test reveal?

1790
01:32:58,907 --> 01:33:02,452
Attitudes that were shocking
to the entire Welfare Department.

1791
01:33:02,952 --> 01:33:04,913
I submit a copy to the court.

1792
01:33:13,755 --> 01:33:17,092
Well, what have you to say about all this?

1793
01:33:20,887 --> 01:33:25,308
Judge, would you mind if we hashed
this over by ourselves for a little while?

1794
01:33:26,810 --> 01:33:29,479
Hash it over, by all means.

1795
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:32,982
Thank you, Judge.

1796
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:36,778
Do you know what I think, Pop?

1797
01:33:36,861 --> 01:33:38,530
I think we don't look so good.

1798
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:41,074
It's unfair.
She's twisted every single fact.

1799
01:33:41,157 --> 01:33:43,201
Now, somebody's gonna untwist it.

1800
01:33:43,284 --> 01:33:44,744
Good for you, Pop.

1801
01:33:44,828 --> 01:33:47,163
Not me. I'll get mad
and that won't do any good.

1802
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:48,832
You take care of it, Toby.

1803
01:33:48,957 --> 01:33:51,209
Me? I ain't very good at talking.

1804
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:53,670
We won't be no worse off than we are now.

1805
01:33:53,795 --> 01:33:55,380
Please, Toby.

1806
01:33:55,463 --> 01:33:57,006
Go ahead, son. Go ahead.

1807
01:33:57,132 --> 01:33:58,216
I don't know, Pop.

1808
01:33:58,299 --> 01:34:00,093
Please. Please, son.

1809
01:34:02,804 --> 01:34:04,973
I'll probably make a mess of things, Judge,

1810
01:34:05,098 --> 01:34:07,559
but Pop and Holly here,
they've got faith in me.

1811
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:10,186
So, here goes.

1812
01:34:10,353 --> 01:34:12,313
You may still hire a lawyer.

1813
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:15,150
Well, Pop's already said no to that

1814
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:18,361
and Pop's usually right
about everything he says.

1815
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:20,196
First off, maybe I was wrong

1816
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:22,907
when I wanted to throw Mr. King
off the property.

1817
01:34:22,991 --> 01:34:24,033
Very gracious of you.

1818
01:34:24,117 --> 01:34:25,118
Yes, sir.

1819
01:34:25,201 --> 01:34:29,289
There's no need for me to get ornery
just because Mr. King got a little nasty.

1820
01:34:29,372 --> 01:34:32,667
Now, just what nasty thing did Mr. King do?

1821
01:34:33,376 --> 01:34:37,172
He tried to throw us off the property
that he had no say-so about.

1822
01:34:37,547 --> 01:34:39,674
Got our backs up and everything.

1823
01:34:41,009 --> 01:34:42,719
Judge, would it be legal-like

1824
01:34:42,844 --> 01:34:45,930
if I were to answer some of the things
that was said against me, personal?

1825
01:34:46,014 --> 01:34:48,641
You may choose the order of your rebuttal.

1826
01:34:49,184 --> 01:34:51,019
That means it's all right?

1827
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:52,729
Yes.

1828
01:34:54,522 --> 01:34:56,191
Well, about my back, then.

1829
01:34:56,316 --> 01:34:58,818
They told me at Fort Dix
that I strained my back

1830
01:34:58,902 --> 01:35:00,737
after my first judo lesson.

1831
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:03,948
I told the docs it had straightened out
after the next lesson

1832
01:35:04,032 --> 01:35:05,867
and it weren't nothing to begin with.

1833
01:35:05,992 --> 01:35:08,995
But they said it was
and I had to go on total disability.

1834
01:35:09,078 --> 01:35:10,497
Now, I'm willing to admit

1835
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:12,832
that a doctor might know
just a little bit more than me,

1836
01:35:12,916 --> 01:35:15,543
so I've been taking the checks ever since.

1837
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:17,170
But the way it's worked out,

1838
01:35:17,253 --> 01:35:19,255
I might have done the wrong thing.

1839
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:21,508
And if I did, I'm awful sorry.

1840
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:25,094
Are you defending yourself,
or making a confession?

1841
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:28,264
I'm just trying to tell what happened.
Is that all right?

1842
01:35:28,389 --> 01:35:31,559
Well, it's pretty unusual, but go on.

1843
01:35:32,894 --> 01:35:34,604
Judge, it don't do me no good

1844
01:35:34,729 --> 01:35:37,774
to talk against people who ain't here
to answer back.

1845
01:35:38,066 --> 01:35:39,692
But all we done to Nick and Carmine

1846
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:42,153
was just return a package
they left at our house.

1847
01:35:42,237 --> 01:35:43,655
We didn't know there was a bomb in it.

1848
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:46,324
If we'd have known it,
we'd have thrown it in the bay.

1849
01:35:46,407 --> 01:35:48,451
And we didn't chase them off
at gunpoint, either.

1850
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:51,454
When their place blowed up,
they just up and beat it.

1851
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:54,833
Well, if you can prove that,
it takes care of an important point.

1852
01:35:54,916 --> 01:35:58,419
Oh, I can prove it, Judge,
but it don't seem that important to me.

1853
01:35:58,545 --> 01:36:00,880
It doesn't, eh? Why not?

1854
01:36:01,256 --> 01:36:02,674
Well, if I was a Judge,

1855
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:05,718
in charge of deciding who was to bring up
three nice kids,

1856
01:36:05,802 --> 01:36:07,554
I'd just be wondering

1857
01:36:08,054 --> 01:36:10,598
if Pop was a good man and if Holly

1858
01:36:12,267 --> 01:36:13,726
was a good woman.

1859
01:36:14,435 --> 01:36:16,020
You can ask the twins about Holly.

1860
01:36:16,104 --> 01:36:19,274
I mean, they're just kids,
but kids know who they love.

1861
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:22,402
And who taught them everything they know
and made them like it.

1862
01:36:22,485 --> 01:36:26,072
Dog me, Holly's just a kid, too,
but they don't come no better.

1863
01:36:26,155 --> 01:36:27,240
And smart, too.

1864
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:28,491
If it weren't for her,

1865
01:36:28,575 --> 01:36:31,286
we'd really be on relief right now
or starving to death.

1866
01:36:31,411 --> 01:36:35,373
I've already pointed out why he'd be
prejudiced on that point, Your Honor.

1867
01:36:35,456 --> 01:36:37,959
I reckon I'm prejudiced on a lot of points
you ain't, ma'am.

1868
01:36:38,084 --> 01:36:40,920
First of all, I'm prejudiced
against twisting the truth around.

1869
01:36:41,004 --> 01:36:43,339
And I'm prejudiced against hurting kids.

1870
01:36:43,464 --> 01:36:47,010
Particularly hurting them
just because I'm sore at their folks.

1871
01:36:47,135 --> 01:36:48,511
Judge, can I say something?

1872
01:36:48,595 --> 01:36:49,721
Go ahead.

1873
01:36:50,305 --> 01:36:52,432
I don't like to say this, Judge.

1874
01:36:52,515 --> 01:36:55,059
I don't like to talk against
a woman's good name.

1875
01:36:55,143 --> 01:36:57,312
But for the sake of the kids, though,
I gotta do it.

1876
01:36:57,437 --> 01:37:00,273
Well, you certainly have me interested.

1877
01:37:00,356 --> 01:37:03,026
Hell ain't got no fury like a woman scorned.

1878
01:37:04,777 --> 01:37:05,820
Yes?

1879
01:37:07,655 --> 01:37:09,157
That's all, Judge.

1880
01:37:11,367 --> 01:37:14,537
Well, Mr. Kwimper, your observation
may or may not be accurate.

1881
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:16,456
I couldn't say which, myself.

1882
01:37:16,539 --> 01:37:18,833
But I would like to know why you said it.

1883
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:22,003
I said it because it's true, Judge.

1884
01:37:22,128 --> 01:37:23,755
That Miss Claypoole there,

1885
01:37:23,838 --> 01:37:26,674
she went after Toby
like he come with green coupons.

1886
01:37:26,799 --> 01:37:28,217
She was leaning on him,

1887
01:37:28,343 --> 01:37:31,095
she was tickling him,
she was kissing him.

1888
01:37:31,179 --> 01:37:33,264
And when he paid her no never mind

1889
01:37:33,348 --> 01:37:36,392
she set out to give us
what hell ain't got no fury like.

1890
01:37:36,517 --> 01:37:40,730
Your Honor, I shall not dignify
that falsehood with a denial.

1891
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:42,357
I should simply like to point out

1892
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:44,317
that it is not I who am on trial here.

1893
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:47,862
No one is on trial here, Miss Claypoole.
This is a hearing.

1894
01:37:49,322 --> 01:37:52,033
Now do you support
what your father just said?

1895
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:54,911
I'd rather not answer that, sir.

1896
01:37:55,536 --> 01:37:59,707
Very well. Briefly then,
did Miss Claypoole ever kiss you?

1897
01:38:01,042 --> 01:38:02,335
Yes, sir.

1898
01:38:02,418 --> 01:38:03,711
Really, Your Honor,

1899
01:38:03,836 --> 01:38:05,463
what do you expect them to say?

1900
01:38:05,546 --> 01:38:06,965
Why, they'll clutch at any straw.

1901
01:38:07,048 --> 01:38:09,050
Please be seated, Miss Claypoole,

1902
01:38:09,133 --> 01:38:11,219
and we'll have no further interruptions.

1903
01:38:12,345 --> 01:38:13,721
Continue.

1904
01:38:14,931 --> 01:38:17,642
I was talking about Pop

1905
01:38:17,725 --> 01:38:20,937
and how it might help you
to know the kind of man he is.

1906
01:38:21,604 --> 01:38:23,606
Pop don't like to be talked about

1907
01:38:23,690 --> 01:38:26,067
and I most generally try to do what he likes.

1908
01:38:26,776 --> 01:38:29,404
But I can't help myself this time, though.

1909
01:38:29,904 --> 01:38:32,407
My pop's an ornery man, Judge,

1910
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:33,950
that's 'cause he's so smart.

1911
01:38:35,076 --> 01:38:37,578
He can't stand it when people act stupid.

1912
01:38:39,288 --> 01:38:41,457
I ain't so bright myself
and it's a wonder to me

1913
01:38:41,541 --> 01:38:43,960
that we get along as well as we do.

1914
01:38:44,293 --> 01:38:46,921
Many a times I was a-minded
to go against him.

1915
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:50,508
I thought maybe there was more to living

1916
01:38:50,591 --> 01:38:52,593
than just enjoying it the way Pop taught me.

1917
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:57,598
But I was never dumb enough
to go against him, Judge.

1918
01:38:57,807 --> 01:39:00,601
And it usually turned out I was glad I didn't.

1919
01:39:00,727 --> 01:39:04,814
Now, it's a fact that Ariadne
and the twins and Holly ain't no kin to Pop.

1920
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:07,942
Now, don't that make you
stop and think, Judge?

1921
01:39:08,067 --> 01:39:10,862
You name me another man
that would take in three hungry children

1922
01:39:10,945 --> 01:39:14,657
just because they ain't got no place to go
and no one to turn to.

1923
01:39:14,782 --> 01:39:17,744
Pop ain't got no money.
He ain't never had.

1924
01:39:18,745 --> 01:39:20,955
Why'd he take in three strange kids?

1925
01:39:21,914 --> 01:39:24,959
<i>I'l</i>l tell you why, Judge,
it's 'cause he's a good man.

1926
01:39:25,251 --> 01:39:28,504
He's always been good to me
and he's always been good to them.

1927
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:30,339
He always will be, too.

1928
01:39:30,465 --> 01:39:32,133
Now, that's all that matters here today,

1929
01:39:32,216 --> 01:39:34,761
and if you don't know that, Judge,

1930
01:39:35,094 --> 01:39:36,596
you ain't no judge.

1931
01:39:41,142 --> 01:39:42,351
Your Honor,

1932
01:39:42,643 --> 01:39:46,814
may I remind you of my findings
in this man's word association test?

1933
01:39:46,939 --> 01:39:48,649
He may mean well consciously,

1934
01:39:48,775 --> 01:39:52,195
but his subconscious motivations
are all that really matter.

1935
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:56,616
Well, have you anything
to say about that test?

1936
01:39:57,658 --> 01:40:00,119
Yes, sir. Could I say it in private?

1937
01:40:00,203 --> 01:40:01,579
Very well.

1938
01:40:02,330 --> 01:40:03,456
Thank you.

1939
01:40:11,047 --> 01:40:15,009
Counsel for the defense points out then,
very correctly,

1940
01:40:15,134 --> 01:40:18,096
that his test has nothing to do
with the case.

1941
01:40:18,179 --> 01:40:22,016
It is his father who is the children's
presumptive guardian.

1942
01:40:22,892 --> 01:40:25,520
Well, let his father take the test.
I have one right here.

1943
01:40:25,645 --> 01:40:27,647
That was counsel's suggestion.

1944
01:40:28,856 --> 01:40:29,982
Yes.

1945
01:40:39,367 --> 01:40:40,868
That's a good idea.

1946
01:40:41,702 --> 01:40:43,371
Mr. Kwimper, please.

1947
01:40:46,165 --> 01:40:48,167
Did you get light in the head?

1948
01:40:49,377 --> 01:40:52,839
Mr. Kwimper, do you understand
the word association test?

1949
01:40:52,922 --> 01:40:55,216
- The test that Toby took? Yep.
- That's right.

1950
01:40:55,341 --> 01:40:57,510
Would you sit down there, please?

1951
01:40:58,386 --> 01:41:00,555
Very well, we may proceed.

1952
01:41:01,055 --> 01:41:02,390
Ready?

1953
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:04,183
Yep.

1961
01:41:39,302 --> 01:41:40,928
Those will be sufficient, Your Honor.

1962
01:41:41,053 --> 01:41:43,764
All right.
Thank you very much, Mr. Kwimper.

1963
01:41:45,766 --> 01:41:47,393
You're welcome, Judge.

1964
01:41:48,227 --> 01:41:51,314
Can you analyze these answers now?

1965
01:41:51,772 --> 01:41:53,232
I believe so.

1966
01:41:53,441 --> 01:41:55,151
Very well. We'll proceed.

1967

Court. Crime.

1968
01:41:58,654 --> 01:42:02,366
Well, that's the simple-minded
response of a criminal nature.

1969
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:05,328
A court is where you go
when you've committed a crime.

1970
01:42:05,453 --> 01:42:06,829
Now wait a minute.

1971
01:42:07,955 --> 01:42:09,123
Never mind.

1972
01:42:09,665 --> 01:42:11,334
Child. Labor.

1973
01:42:12,001 --> 01:42:13,544
Oh, that's obvious.

1974
01:42:13,628 --> 01:42:16,756
He thinks of children in terms
of exploiting their labor.

1975
01:42:16,839 --> 01:42:18,883
Oh, now, really, I think that is...

1976
01:42:18,966 --> 01:42:22,011
Your Honor,
I have a Master's degree in psychology.

What's that got to do with alcoholics?

1981
01:42:39,445 --> 01:42:41,322
- I don't understand...
- That's enough.

1982
01:42:41,447 --> 01:42:43,407
Your request for a court order is denied.

1983
01:42:43,491 --> 01:42:45,201
I don't think you understand.
Any qualified...

1984
01:42:45,326 --> 01:42:49,121
Miss Claypoole, you're the one
who doesn't understand this test.

They were mine.

You couldn't have had a better one.

1990
01:43:12,853 --> 01:43:16,649
Well, this court has had
a remarkable experience today.

1991
01:43:17,316 --> 01:43:20,820
It's had the rare privilege
of listening to an honest man.

1992
01:43:20,903 --> 01:43:23,072
And it's had a further privilege.

1993
01:43:23,239 --> 01:43:25,992
It has heard the history
of a little settlement,

1994
01:43:26,075 --> 01:43:29,829
a little colony that overcame hardships,

1995
01:43:29,912 --> 01:43:32,206
fought back men of evil purpose

1996
01:43:32,873 --> 01:43:37,336
and survived all kinds
of legalistic and financial difficulties.

1997
01:43:38,504 --> 01:43:41,173
It's gratifying to know
that the spirit of the pioneer,

is still functioning today.

Our government needs it more than ever,
don't you think?

2002
01:43:54,228 --> 01:43:56,439
I agree, Judge. I'm willing to admit

2003
01:43:56,564 --> 01:43:58,941
that I've been letting
the government down a little lately,

2004

I haven't been taking any relief
or unemployment insurance

01:47:06,253 --> 01:47:07,755
You look awful pretty tonight.

2046
01:47:07,838 --> 01:47:08,839
Thank you.

2047
01:47:08,923 --> 01:47:11,592
Too bad ain't nobody here to see you.

2048
01:47:11,759 --> 01:47:13,135
Isn't it, though.

2049
01:47:14,261 --> 01:47:15,721
- Toby.
- Hmm.

2050
01:47:16,722 --> 01:47:18,265
I want the truth.

2051
01:47:19,266 --> 01:47:22,311
What did that Claypoole woman do
to make you kiss her?

2052
01:47:22,436 --> 01:47:23,604
Oh, you know, Holly.
You know.

2053
01:47:23,687 --> 01:47:24,688
No, I don't.

2054
01:47:24,772 --> 01:47:26,273
Now, you answer me.

2055
01:47:27,316 --> 01:47:29,818
Oh, we was lying on them pillows,
remember?

2056
01:47:29,944 --> 01:47:31,278
I remember.

2057
01:47:31,445 --> 01:47:33,030
Well, we was lying on them...

2058
01:47:33,113 --> 01:47:37,159
Oh, I want you to show me
exactly what happened.

2059
01:47:37,952 --> 01:47:39,286
Step by Step-

2060
01:47:40,120 --> 01:47:41,247
Now,

2061
01:47:41,997 --> 01:47:45,000
you were lying down like this.
And then what?

2062
01:47:45,125 --> 01:47:47,920
Then she kind of
leaned down real close to me.

2063
01:47:50,297 --> 01:47:52,132
- Like this?
- Mmm-hmm.

2064
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:55,135
She run her fingers over my forehead.

2065
01:47:58,472 --> 01:47:59,682
Like this?

2066
01:47:59,807 --> 01:48:03,811
Well, not so much like you was
ironing a shirt, it was a little softer.

2067
01:48:05,813 --> 01:48:06,939
That's it.

2068
01:48:08,482 --> 01:48:11,485
And then she made me
put my arms around her.

2069
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:19,994
- Like this?
- Mmm-hmm.

2070
01:48:20,536 --> 01:48:23,998
Then she leaned down and kissed me,
and I guess I kissed her.

2071
01:48:33,674 --> 01:48:34,842
<i>1 ob'! ,</i>

2072
01:48:35,467 --> 01:48:37,970
are you doing that darn times table?

2073
01:48:38,053 --> 01:48:41,348
But you know something?
I never got to the 12's so fast.

2074
01:48:42,850 --> 01:48:45,978
12 times 12 is 144.

2075
01:48:46,895 --> 01:48:49,565
What bothers me
is what comes after the 12's.

2076
01:48:50,316 --> 01:48:51,692
Me, Toby.

2077
01:48:52,318 --> 01:48:53,527
Me.

2078
01:48:56,363 --> 01:48:58,032
(WATER GURGLING)

2079
01:48:58,324 --> 01:49:00,034
(WATER EXPLODING)

2080
01:49:04,371 --> 01:49:05,914
POP: Got to fix that.

2081
01:49:06,582 --> 01:49:08,500
She's loaded with pressure.
