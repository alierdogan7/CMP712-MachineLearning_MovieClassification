00:00:01,296 --> 00:00:03,197
<i>So here's what you missed on
Glee. Puck tried to steal an ATM</i>

2
00:00:03,265 --> 00:00:05,215
<i>and got himself stuck in juvie. As
far as badasses go, I'm number one.</i>

3
00:00:05,283 --> 00:00:06,834
<i>Sam and Quinn are sort of a couple,</i>

4
00:00:06,885 --> 00:00:07,835
<i>and so are Mike and Tina.</i>

5
00:00:07,886 --> 00:00:08,752
<i>Artie and Brittany went out,</i>

6
00:00:08,837 --> 00:00:10,054
<i>but then he sort of dumped her,</i>

7
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:10,871
<i>and now he sort of wants her back.</i>

8
00:00:10,922 --> 00:00:12,740
<i>Kurt's pretty lonely</i>

9
00:00:12,807 --> 00:00:14,058
<i>all by himself, and so is Coach Beiste.</i>

10
00:00:14,142 --> 00:00:15,375
<i>Sue keeps trying to get her to quit.</i>

11
00:00:16,227 --> 00:00:17,544
<i>Are those dog poop cookies?</i>

12
00:00:17,596 --> 00:00:18,896
<i>And that's what you missed on Glee.</i>

13
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,373
Phew.

14
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,292
Ooh. Dude.

15
00:00:33,343 --> 00:00:35,344
How do you stand that cold tub?

16
00:00:35,428 --> 00:00:37,546
I'm used to cold showers dating Quinn.

17
00:00:44,721 --> 00:00:46,855
No.

18
00:00:46,923 --> 00:00:48,140
How about a little something-something?

19
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:49,275
A little something-something

20
00:00:49,342 --> 00:00:50,809
always leads to something more.

21
00:00:50,877 --> 00:00:52,177
I've been there, remember?

22
00:00:52,245 --> 00:00:54,647
When we're prom king
and queen, it will feel

23
00:00:54,698 --> 00:00:58,183
just as good as a little
something-something.

24
00:00:58,235 --> 00:00:59,735
Been there, dude.

25
00:00:59,803 --> 00:01:02,054
Actually, still there now, but

26
00:01:02,122 --> 00:01:04,073
how did we find the only two girls

27
00:01:04,157 --> 00:01:05,691
in high school that won't put out?

28
00:01:05,742 --> 00:01:08,193
What do you do, though?

29
00:01:08,245 --> 00:01:10,246
Well, easy.

30
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:14,066
I just think about the
opposite of what I'm doing.

31
00:01:23,643 --> 00:01:25,427
(grunts) (screaming) Oh, my God!

32
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:33,519
I've never actually almost
killed a civil servant before.

33
00:01:33,586 --> 00:01:37,056
Well, you have to find something
to be your own buzz kill.

34
00:01:37,123 --> 00:01:40,009
You know, something
that is total not hot.

35
00:01:40,076 --> 00:01:41,493
BEISTE: I don't care!

36
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:44,246
If you're on this football team,

37
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:45,364
you'll wear a cup, no exceptions!

38
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:46,582
Hey, have you ever noticed

39
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:47,750
that when the Beiste gets all fired up,

40
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:48,968
her underpants go right up her butt?

41
00:01:49,035 --> 00:01:50,452
...in your groin with that helmet?

42
00:01:50,537 --> 00:01:53,772
<i>You think The Nutcracker's
just a musical?</i>

43
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,042
Looks like I've found
my mailman. Yes, you did.

44

46
00:02:02,716 --> 00:02:04,967
I take it we have a
lot of sweater trains

47
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:06,852
to look forward to this season.

48
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,141
Are you okay?

49
00:02:12,225 --> 00:02:14,926
Yeah. Fine.

50
00:02:14,978 --> 00:02:16,812
(school bell ringing)

51
00:02:19,232 --> 00:02:22,451
All right, guys, let's
get down to business.

52
00:02:22,535 --> 00:02:25,487
First, let's welcome
back Noah Puckerman.

53
00:02:25,572 --> 00:02:27,156
(applause)

54
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,774
Puck, I hope your time in juvie

55
00:02:28,825 --> 00:02:31,126
has taught you a lesson or
two about right and wrong.

56
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:33,128
Are you kidding me? I ruled that place.

57
00:02:33,196 --> 00:02:35,664
All I did was crack skulls
and lift weights all day.

58
00:02:35,732 --> 00:02:36,732
QUINN: Wow, what a catch.

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,750
Can't believe I ever let you go.

60
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:39,551
And now, drum roll, Finn.

61
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:41,837
Because I have in my hand

62
00:02:41,921 --> 00:02:44,423
our competition for
Sectionals next month.

63
00:02:44,474 --> 00:02:45,457
(applause and cheering)

64
00:02:45,508 --> 00:02:47,226
First, the a capella choir

65
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:49,144
from the all-boys' private
school in Westerville,

66
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:50,979
the Dalton Academy Warblers.

67
00:02:51,064 --> 00:02:52,348
(cheering)

68
00:02:52,432 --> 00:02:53,932
Okay, hold up.

69
00:02:53,983 --> 00:02:56,468
Like, a million awesome gay
jokes just popped into my head.

70
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:57,870
And the other
team to beat--

71
00:02:57,937 --> 00:02:59,671
The Hipsters,

72
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:01,156
a first-year club

73
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:03,642
from the Warren Township
Continuing Education Program.

74
00:03:03,693 --> 00:03:04,993
Now, they are a glee club

75
00:03:05,078 --> 00:03:07,112
composed entirely of elderly people

76
00:03:07,163 --> 00:03:09,531
getting their high school
GEDs. Is that legal?

77
00:03:09,616 --> 00:03:10,566
How are we supposed to compete against

78
00:03:10,633 --> 00:03:11,817
a bunch of adorable old people?

79
00:03:11,868 --> 00:03:13,335
Are you kidding? Brittle bones.

80
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,671
Give one of those old ladies
a good-luck pat on the rear,

81
00:03:15,755 --> 00:03:16,889
it'll shatter her pelvis.

82
00:03:16,956 --> 00:03:18,841
WILL: Moving on. Since it seemed

83
00:03:18,925 --> 00:03:21,043
to get you guys jazzed
about Sectionals last year,

84
00:03:21,127 --> 00:03:22,828
I want to make this week

85
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,163
our second annual Boys
Versus Girls tournament.

86
00:03:25,215 --> 00:03:27,633
(cheering and whooping) Yes!

87
00:03:27,684 --> 00:03:29,518
So, split up into two groups,

88
00:03:29,602 --> 00:03:31,837
and figure out what songs
you're going to sing.

89
00:03:31,888 --> 00:03:35,641
Great. Okay, I have
mash-up ideas in my head.

90
00:03:35,692 --> 00:03:39,344
Kurt, gonna say it
again-- boys' team.

91
00:03:39,396 --> 00:03:41,146
MERCEDES: Okay, how about y'all...?

92
00:03:41,197 --> 00:03:43,031
SAM: I say we do a whole AC/DC.

93
00:03:43,116 --> 00:03:44,533
Like, the lead guitarist,

94
00:03:44,617 --> 00:03:46,785
like, drops his pants at every concert.

95
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:48,019
Mm-hmm, yeah.

96
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:49,521
Pants here...

97
00:03:49,572 --> 00:03:50,656
(school bell ringing)

98
00:03:50,707 --> 00:03:52,875
I know it's not my place to ask,

99
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,193
but can you push me
down the back staircase?

100
00:03:55,245 --> 00:03:58,130
My injuries should be the same,
but it's more lightly populated,

101
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,082
so the humiliation won't be as bad.

102
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,834
Relax. I'm here to take care of you.

103
00:04:01,885 --> 00:04:03,252
You're my boy now. I don't understand.

104
00:04:03,336 --> 00:04:04,670
I got out of juvie early

105
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:06,204
because I agreed to
do community service,

106
00:04:06,256 --> 00:04:08,006
but I ain't pickin' up
trash along the freeway.

107
00:04:08,057 --> 00:04:09,207
That's ghetto.

108
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:11,093
So I told my probie officer that I knew

109
00:04:11,177 --> 00:04:13,395
a cripple that needed
some help. She went for it.

110
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,646
I'm your community service?

111
00:04:14,714 --> 00:04:16,231
There's no way I'm going back to juvie.

112
00:04:16,316 --> 00:04:18,684
There's no chicks and no kosher
meal options up in that place.

113
00:04:18,735 --> 00:04:19,852
Cool. So we're, like, friends.

114
00:04:19,903 --> 00:04:21,270
Oh, slow down, Professor X.

115
00:04:21,354 --> 00:04:23,555
I never said anything about liking you.

116
00:04:23,606 --> 00:04:24,890
Now shut up right quick.

117
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:26,224
We're going to steal some food

118
00:04:26,276 --> 00:04:27,409
from the cafeteria.

119
00:04:27,494 --> 00:04:29,561
This chair's a great
place for hiding stuff.

120
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:32,865
What is your problem?!

121
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,700
You talking back to me?

122
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:36,835
You want a piece of The Fury?

123
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:38,620
The Fury? That's what I named my fist.

124
00:04:38,705 --> 00:04:40,622
Well, with that level of
creativity, you could easily

125
00:04:40,707 --> 00:04:42,073
become assistant manager
at a rendering plant.

126
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:45,093
I don't know what that is,
but if I find out it's bad,

127
00:04:45,178 --> 00:04:46,578
The Fury's going to find you.

128
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:47,629
(slamming)

129
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:53,802
(school bell ringing)

130
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,888
Is there anything that I could do?

131
00:04:58,391 --> 00:05:00,192
(sighing): No.

132
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:02,227
This is my hill to climb alone.

133
00:05:02,278 --> 00:05:04,980
Can I be honest?

134
00:05:05,048 --> 00:05:07,332
I think it's getting to you.

135
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,435
Usually this stuff rolls
right off your back,

136
00:05:10,503 --> 00:05:11,987
but lately, you've been belligerent,

137
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:13,405
angry, pushing people away.

138
00:05:13,456 --> 00:05:15,908
Can I be honest with you?

139
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,659
You, like everyone else at this school,

140
00:05:17,744 --> 00:05:19,378
are too quick to let homophobia slide.

141
00:05:19,445 --> 00:05:22,064
And your lesson plans
are boring and repetitive.

142
00:05:22,131 --> 00:05:23,832
Boys Versus Girls?

143
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,334
That doesn't challenge any of us.

144
00:05:25,401 --> 00:05:26,418
You mean, because I didn't let you

145
00:05:26,486 --> 00:05:27,719
join the girls like you wanted?

146
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:31,390
To answer your question,
yes, I'm unhappy.

147
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:33,008
And yes, being the only

148
00:05:33,092 --> 00:05:35,460
out gay kid at this school gets me down,

149
00:05:35,512 --> 00:05:37,563
but most of all,

150
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,798
I'm not challenged in the least here.

151
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:42,401
(school bell ringing)

152
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:45,354
<i>WILL: Look, I'm not tossing the
baby out with the bathwater here.</i>

153
00:05:45,438 --> 00:05:46,605
I've totally done that.

154
00:05:46,656 --> 00:05:49,157
We're just making an adjustment.

155
00:05:49,242 --> 00:05:50,776
Boys, you are now doing songs

156
00:05:50,827 --> 00:05:52,027
traditionally sung by girl groups.

157
00:05:52,111 --> 00:05:55,113
And girls, try
some classic rock--

158
00:05:55,164 --> 00:05:56,798
uh, the Who, the Stones.

159
00:05:56,866 --> 00:05:59,284
The more opposite your choice,
the more points you get.

160
00:05:59,335 --> 00:06:00,452
Don't worry, gentlemen.

161
00:06:00,503 --> 00:06:02,004
I have this one under control.

162
00:06:02,088 --> 00:06:04,823
Now, obviously, for this medley to work,

163
00:06:04,874 --> 00:06:06,758
I'm going to have to sing lead,

164
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:08,877
and, of course, when
you're singing Diana Ross,

165
00:06:08,962 --> 00:06:11,947
Bob Mackie-esque maribou
feather boas are a must.

166
00:06:12,015 --> 00:06:14,099
Isn't this lesson about opposites?

167
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,351
I mean, you in a sequined
gown and a feather boa

168
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:17,536
is exactly what you'd expect.

169
00:06:17,604 --> 00:06:18,837
Okay, who said anything about a gown?

170
00:06:18,905 --> 00:06:20,872
Uh, dude, why don't you
make yourself useful,

171
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,775
and go put some rat poison
in the old folks' Jell-O,

172
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:25,477
or visit the garglers? The Warblers.

173
00:06:25,528 --> 00:06:26,645
Whatever. See what they're up to.

174
00:06:26,696 --> 00:06:28,146
And you can wear all
the feathers you want.

175
00:06:28,197 --> 00:06:29,180
You'll blend right in.

176
00:06:32,118 --> 00:06:33,852
(sighs) Fine.

177
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,551
(whispering): Is this
hot enough for you?

178
00:06:55,742 --> 00:06:57,092
(puckers lips)

179
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:04,883
(softly): Say my name, Sam.

180
00:07:04,934 --> 00:07:07,235
I said, say my name.

181
00:07:08,855 --> 00:07:10,155
(door slamming)

182
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,524
I said, say my name.

183
00:07:12,575 --> 00:07:15,027
Beiste.

184
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:18,229
(mumbles)

185
00:07:18,281 --> 00:07:20,032
Are you okay?

186
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:21,399
Yeah.

187
00:07:21,451 --> 00:07:23,418
I could do this for hours.

188
00:07:28,202 --> 00:07:29,602
I know what I heard.

189
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,737
There we were, making out,
and he said it: "Beiste."

190
00:07:31,788 --> 00:07:33,656
I think he was picturing
making out with her.

191
00:07:33,724 --> 00:07:37,193
That is the most horrific
image I can imagine.

192
00:07:37,261 --> 00:07:38,444
Coach, I need help.

193
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,745
I've done everything I can

194
00:07:39,796 --> 00:07:40,913
to rehabilitate my image.

195
00:07:40,981 --> 00:07:42,114
I'm getting straight A's,

196
00:07:42,165 --> 00:07:43,833
dating the cutest guy at school.

197
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:45,985
Who would rather be
dry-humping She-Hulk.

198
00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:47,603
Oh, dear God, why did I say that?

199
00:07:47,671 --> 00:07:48,921
Now that's what I'm picturing.

200
00:07:48,972 --> 00:07:50,089
Do you know what kind
of disgusting images

201
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,274
I'm going to have to look at

202
00:07:51,341 --> 00:07:52,892
to get this out of my head?

203
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,860
I'm gonna have to go straight
to the wound care center.

204
00:07:54,928 --> 00:07:56,195
I'm gonna have to stare at some wounds.

205
00:07:56,263 --> 00:07:58,447
Coach, I really don't know what to do.

206
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,733
Wait.

207
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,185
This may be the opportunity
I've been waiting for.

208
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,571
A way to get Beiste out of this school

209
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,657
and your Macaulay Culkin

210
00:08:07,724 --> 00:08:09,191
stunt double back in your arms.

211
00:08:09,276 --> 00:08:10,826
What do I have to do?

212
00:08:10,911 --> 00:08:12,811
We need to go public with your pain.

213
00:08:12,863 --> 00:08:14,830
Get people talking about this,

214
00:08:14,915 --> 00:08:16,582
make Beiste into the
next Mary Kay Letourneau.

215
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,918
And you need to give
him a piece of your mind.

216
00:08:18,985 --> 00:08:21,771
Loud and in public.

217
00:08:21,838 --> 00:08:23,122
Show him who's the boss.

218
00:08:23,173 --> 00:08:24,323
Oh, man.

219
00:08:24,374 --> 00:08:26,208
Now I'm picturing the two of them

220
00:08:26,293 --> 00:08:28,461
<i>making out during an
episode of Who's the Boss?</i>

221
00:08:28,512 --> 00:08:31,430
(school bell ringing)

222
00:08:31,498 --> 00:08:33,165
Shouldn't you be studying geometry?

223
00:08:33,216 --> 00:08:35,184
Aren't you failing?

224
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:36,802
One thing I learned in juvie?

225
00:08:36,853 --> 00:08:39,272
Cash is king.

226
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:41,274
Lets people know we're
not doing it for free.

227
00:08:41,341 --> 00:08:43,559
Wait, you think people are
going to pay us to sing?

228
00:08:43,644 --> 00:08:46,562
I don't think busking
is allowed in school.

229
00:08:46,647 --> 00:08:49,482
Watch and learn, young
Jedi in a wheelchair.

230
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:51,400
(Bob Marley's "One Love" begins)

231
00:08:54,538 --> 00:08:56,455

Yeah, you really can't
put a dollar amount

266
00:10:38,175 --> 00:10:39,592
on the value of talent plus fear.

267
00:10:39,643 --> 00:10:42,294
I can. It's about 300 bucks.

268
00:10:42,345 --> 00:10:44,129
What are we going to do with it?

269
00:10:44,181 --> 00:10:46,432
Buy a butt load of clove
cigarettes, then I don't know.

270
00:10:49,352 --> 00:10:50,770
You want her?

271
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:52,855
You don't need any cash
for that. She's free.

272
00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:54,857
She was my first.

273
00:10:54,941 --> 00:10:56,942
Now I-I think I want her back.

274
00:10:56,993 --> 00:10:58,194
So go get her.

275
00:10:58,278 --> 00:10:59,578
It's not that simple.

276
00:10:59,646 --> 00:11:02,615
I was kind of mean to
her when I blew her off.

277
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,700
This is perfect. The thing
about chicks is you only have

278
00:11:04,785 --> 00:11:06,819
to be a fraction as nice to
them as you are mean to them

279
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,504
to get them to like you again.

280
00:11:08,588 --> 00:11:09,839

283
00:11:13,993 --> 00:11:15,828
and go on a double date

284
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,379

285
00:11:18,849 --> 00:11:20,049

290
00:11:32,229 --> 00:11:33,846

00:11:43,957 --> 00:11:46,024

school down for a while.

298
00:11:47,694 --> 00:11:50,212
So, wait, the glee club
here is kind of cool?

299
00:11:50,297 --> 00:11:52,331

(whooping)

374
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:05,441
TINA: Wait. That's hilarious.

375
00:15:05,508 --> 00:15:08,243
Picturing Beiste helps cool you off?

376
00:15:10,163 --> 00:15:11,730
That's what Sam said.

377
00:15:11,781 --> 00:15:12,898
Really?

378
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:14,867
Well, then let's get a room.

379
00:15:17,504 --> 00:15:19,371
I love making out under the stars.

380
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:26,128
With those abs, you could
be my very own situation.

381
00:15:29,082 --> 00:15:30,215
Slow down.

382
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:31,800
Can't get caught in here.

383
00:15:31,885 --> 00:15:34,219
We should probably cool off.

384
00:15:35,388 --> 00:15:38,090
But I'm so turned on right now.

385
00:15:43,563 --> 00:15:45,531
This'll cool you down a little bit.

386
00:15:45,598 --> 00:15:46,732
(whispers): Beiste.

387
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,484
What did you say?

388
00:15:48,568 --> 00:15:50,152
Nothing.

389
00:15:51,654 --> 00:15:53,572
I got to go.

390
00:15:53,623 --> 00:15:55,290
I'll see you in Glee Club.

391
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,959
(whispers): Beiste?

392
00:15:57,043 --> 00:15:58,911
<i>QUINN: Just be honest
with me-- I won't get mad</i>

393
00:15:58,962 --> 00:16:00,462
at you if you tell me the truth.

394
00:16:00,547 --> 00:16:01,880
I'll be relieved.

395
00:16:01,948 --> 00:16:03,999
Really? Because it looks
like you're gonna be mad

396
00:16:04,084 --> 00:16:05,584
no matter what I say.

397
00:16:05,635 --> 00:16:07,786
You said another woman's name
while you were kissing me.

398
00:16:07,837 --> 00:16:09,221
Look, I
get it--

399
00:16:09,288 --> 00:16:10,956
she's in a position of power over you,

400
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,424
which can be exciting, and you clearly

401
00:16:12,475 --> 00:16:14,176
like women who give you a hard time.

402
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,895
I'm not cheating on you
with my football coach.

403
00:16:16,963 --> 00:16:19,348
Look, can we talk about this in private?

404
00:16:19,432 --> 00:16:21,633
Why, am I embarrassing you?
It's not what you think.

405
00:16:21,684 --> 00:16:23,969
What I think is that I'm
not putting out for you,

406
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,437
so you're getting it wherever you can,

407
00:16:25,488 --> 00:16:26,822
including the locker
room with the Beiste.

408
00:16:26,906 --> 00:16:27,990
What's this?

409
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:30,609
This is a lovers quarrel
and is your fault.

410
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,994
Watch your tone with me, missy.

411
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:33,979
You crap on my leg, I'll cut it off.

412
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,664
I'll leave you two.

413
00:16:38,818 --> 00:16:39,651
Everything okay?

414
00:16:41,588 --> 00:16:43,956
Stay away from my woman.

415
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:47,843
What hell's going on around here?

416
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:51,830
What's going on, Sam?

417
00:16:58,088 --> 00:16:59,689
How many of the guys have done this?

418
00:16:59,773 --> 00:17:01,124
All the guys whose
girlfriends won't put out.

419
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:02,208
It's the girls, too.

420
00:17:02,276 --> 00:17:03,576
This is really bad, guys.

421
00:17:03,644 --> 00:17:06,095
What if Coach Beiste
were to find out about it?

422
00:17:06,163 --> 00:17:07,830
Think about how hurt she'd be.

423
00:17:07,915 --> 00:17:09,198
It's not personal.

424
00:17:09,283 --> 00:17:10,416
Of course it's personal!

425
00:17:10,484 --> 00:17:11,517
Look, Coach Beiste

426
00:17:11,585 --> 00:17:13,453
is like us,
like Glee Club--

427
00:17:13,504 --> 00:17:14,971
she's an outsider at this school.

428
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,340
No one appreciates her or her talent,

429
00:17:17,424 --> 00:17:19,509
because they've decided
that she's too different.

430
00:17:19,593 --> 00:17:22,679
And for you guys to abuse
that, even in private,

431
00:17:22,763 --> 00:17:25,732
is the opposite of everything
we're trying to achieve in here.

432
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,350
But we're just thinking about it,

433
00:17:27,434 --> 00:17:28,501
it's not like we're actually, you know,

434
00:17:28,552 --> 00:17:30,169
making fun of her to her face.

435
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,670
I need you to stop.

436
00:17:31,722 --> 00:17:35,975
And spread the word to all
the other Glee guys. And girls.

437
00:17:36,026 --> 00:17:38,444
This ends here and now.

438
00:17:38,512 --> 00:17:41,614
And Coach Beiste can
never know about this.

439
00:17:41,682 --> 00:17:42,681
Okay.

440
00:17:42,733 --> 00:17:43,783
Sorry.

441
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:44,851
(bell rings)

442
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:46,486
BLAINE: Latte? Thank you.

443
00:17:46,537 --> 00:17:47,820
This is Wes

444
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:49,288
and David.

445
00:17:49,356 --> 00:17:50,990
It's very civilized

446
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,709
for you to invite me for coffee

447
00:17:52,793 --> 00:17:54,510
before you beat me up for spying.

448
00:17:54,578 --> 00:17:57,463
We are not going to beat you
up. You were such a terrible spy,

449
00:17:57,531 --> 00:17:59,632
we thought it was sort of... endearing.

450
00:17:59,699 --> 00:18:01,467
Which made me think that spying on us

451
00:18:01,535 --> 00:18:03,386
wasn't really the reason you came.

452
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:07,190
Can I ask you guys a question?

453
00:18:09,893 --> 00:18:12,645
Are you guys all gay?

454
00:18:12,713 --> 00:18:14,347
(laughter)

455
00:18:14,415 --> 00:18:16,065
BLAINE: Uh, uh, no.

456
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:19,569
I mean, I am, but these
two have girlfriends.

457
00:18:19,653 --> 00:18:20,737
This is not a gay school.

458
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:21,904
We just have a zero-tolerance

459
00:18:21,989 --> 00:18:23,389
harassment policy.

460
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,858
Everybody gets treated the
same, no matter what they are.

461
00:18:25,926 --> 00:18:26,926
It's pretty simple.

462
00:18:32,449 --> 00:18:35,585
Would you guys excuse us?

463
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:37,787
Yeah. Take it easy, Kurt.

464
00:18:45,012 --> 00:18:47,096
I take it you're having
trouble at school.

465
00:18:47,164 --> 00:18:50,950
I'm the only person out
of the closet at my school.

466
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:55,688
And I-I... I tried to
stay strong about it,

467
00:18:55,755 --> 00:18:59,475
but... there's this Neanderthal
who's made it his mission

468
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,862
to make my life a living hell.

469
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,548
And nobody seems to notice.

470
00:19:05,616 --> 00:19:07,733
I know how you feel.

471
00:19:10,204 --> 00:19:11,988
I got taunted at my old school,

472
00:19:12,072 --> 00:19:15,158
and it really... pissed me off.

473
00:19:15,225 --> 00:19:18,144
I even complained
about it to the faculty,

474
00:19:18,212 --> 00:19:20,930
and they were sympathetic and all,
but you could just tell that...

475
00:19:20,998 --> 00:19:23,749
nobody really cared.

476
00:19:23,801 --> 00:19:25,635
It was, like,

477
00:19:25,702 --> 00:19:29,255
"Hey, if you're gay, your
life's just gonna be miserable.

478
00:19:29,323 --> 00:19:32,475
Sorry. Nothing we can do about it."

479
00:19:34,144 --> 00:19:36,979
So I left, and I came here.

480
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:38,731
Simple as that.

481
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,918
So you have two options.

482
00:19:41,985 --> 00:19:44,136
I mean, I'd love to tell
you to just come enroll here,

483
00:19:44,188 --> 00:19:46,005
but tuition at Dalton's
sort of steep, and I know

484
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:47,540
that's not an option for everybody.

485
00:19:47,608 --> 00:19:48,858
Or...

486
00:19:48,942 --> 00:19:51,160
you can refuse to be the victim.

487
00:19:53,597 --> 00:19:56,449
Prejudice is just ignorance, Kurt,

488
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,600
and you have a chance

489
00:19:57,668 --> 00:19:59,168
right now to teach him.

490
00:19:59,253 --> 00:20:01,971
How?

491
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,756
Confront him.

492
00:20:03,823 --> 00:20:05,208
Call him out.

493
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:10,346
I ran... Kurt.

494
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:13,783
I didn't stand up.

495
00:20:13,851 --> 00:20:15,968
I let bullies chase me away,

496
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:19,639
and it is something that
I really... really regret.

497
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,141
(bell rings)

498
00:20:22,209 --> 00:20:24,694
The boys beat us the last
time we competed against them.

499
00:20:24,778 --> 00:20:26,779
We've got to bring the
noise hard this time.

500
00:20:26,846 --> 00:20:28,781
QUINN: To be fair, they
didn't officially beat us.

501
00:20:28,848 --> 00:20:31,350
We got busted for vitamin D
possession before the vote.

502
00:20:31,401 --> 00:20:33,569
Wait. Something's definitely wrong.

503
00:20:33,654 --> 00:20:35,454
Why isn't Rachel
talking? Yeah, she should

504
00:20:35,522 --> 00:20:37,039
totally be bossing us around right now.

505
00:20:37,124 --> 00:20:39,125
The idea of the assignment
was to do the opposite

506
00:20:39,192 --> 00:20:40,660
or what we normally do.

507
00:20:40,711 --> 00:20:42,912
I'm just trying to stick
to the lesson plan, which is

508
00:20:42,996 --> 00:20:44,347
proving nearly impossible

509
00:20:44,414 --> 00:20:45,748
since you're gluing those
sequins on backwards.

510
00:20:47,084 --> 00:20:48,134
Spies!

511
00:20:48,201 --> 00:20:49,252
Lighten up--
we're here

512
00:20:49,336 --> 00:20:50,836
to talk to Santana and Brittany.

513
00:20:50,888 --> 00:20:53,372
PUCK (quietly): Remember,
don't trust your instincts.

514
00:20:53,423 --> 00:20:56,976
Hmm. So, how does it
feel to be a free man?

515
00:20:57,043 --> 00:20:58,411
All I can say is that I don't want

516
00:20:58,478 --> 00:20:59,812
a long-term relationship
with either of you.

517
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,264
Especially Brittany, since
I'm not in love with her.

518
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:03,733
Do you guys want to go
out to dinner tonight?

519
00:21:03,817 --> 00:21:05,551
Not really.

520
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:07,219
Oh. Tell you what,

521
00:21:07,271 --> 00:21:09,589
you two show up at Breadstix
tomorrow night around 7:00.

522
00:21:09,656 --> 00:21:11,190
If we don't find hotter
chicks to date tonight,

523
00:21:11,241 --> 00:21:12,158
we might show up.

524
00:21:12,226 --> 00:21:13,342
(gasps)

525
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,627
You are totally cool.

526
00:21:14,695 --> 00:21:15,661
Awesome.

527
00:21:17,464 --> 00:21:19,532
I can't believe it.

528
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:22,168
You're a genius.

529
00:21:22,235 --> 00:21:24,069
(bell rings)

530
00:21:26,406 --> 00:21:27,957
Hey, Will,

531
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,092
can I talk to you for a second?

532
00:21:30,177 --> 00:21:32,845
Yeah. What's going on
with your Glee Club kids?

533
00:21:32,913 --> 00:21:35,414
They've been mouthing off to me.

534
00:21:35,465 --> 00:21:38,768
One of them even said to
stay away from their girl?

535
00:21:38,852 --> 00:21:40,636
I-I don't get it.

536
00:21:40,721 --> 00:21:42,521
You know, I'm the coach here, Will,

537
00:21:42,589 --> 00:21:44,540
and if the students
here don't respect me...

538
00:21:44,608 --> 00:21:47,476
pfft, I can't do my job.

539
00:21:48,912 --> 00:21:50,613
(sighs) Well, Coach...

540
00:21:52,932 --> 00:21:56,118
I... I don't know what to tell you.

541
00:21:56,203 --> 00:21:58,604
Will, please, be straight with me.

542
00:21:58,655 --> 00:22:00,373
You're the only person

543
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,158
at this school I trust.

544
00:22:04,077 --> 00:22:05,995
Please.

545
00:22:06,063 --> 00:22:09,048
(sighs)

546
00:22:09,116 --> 00:22:10,967
Why don't you have a seat?

547
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:22,094
Uh...

548
00:22:22,162 --> 00:22:24,930
Th-Th-This is
really awful,

549
00:22:24,982 --> 00:22:27,400
and I don't want you
to take it personally.

550
00:22:27,467 --> 00:22:28,484
I mean, they're just kids.

551
00:22:28,568 --> 00:22:30,736
You-you know how they can be.

552
00:22:30,804 --> 00:22:32,922
Just-just tell me.

553
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,775
(sighs)

554
00:22:35,826 --> 00:22:38,177
I-I guess...

555
00:22:38,245 --> 00:22:42,348
it's... become sort of a-a thing,

556
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:46,369
that... when the kids
are making out, and...

557
00:22:49,156 --> 00:22:54,377
Th-Th-They sort of want
to... cool off a little...

558
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,631
They think of you.

559
00:23:00,834 --> 00:23:02,768
In compromising positions.

560
00:23:02,836 --> 00:23:04,503
(sighs)

561
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:08,007
Like what?

562
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,045
Like...

563
00:23:13,113 --> 00:23:15,481
in lingerie...

564
00:23:15,532 --> 00:23:16,816
Oh...

565
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:18,484
Coach, don't take it personally.

566
00:23:18,535 --> 00:23:21,253
I do take it personally, Will.

567
00:23:21,321 --> 00:23:22,521
(sighs)

568
00:23:22,572 --> 00:23:25,458
I take it very, very personally.

569
00:23:27,911 --> 00:23:29,795
No. Sh-Shannon.

570
00:23:29,863 --> 00:23:31,247
Shannon, wait. I...

571
00:23:33,032 --> 00:23:34,700
(groans)

572
00:23:34,751 --> 00:23:36,368
(school bell rings)

573
00:23:39,327 --> 00:23:40,377
So there I was. At juvie.

574
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:41,745
In the breakfast line in the mess hall.

575
00:23:41,813 --> 00:23:43,130
When I notice me and this guy behind me

576
00:23:43,181 --> 00:23:44,181
going for the same waffle.

577
00:23:44,265 --> 00:23:46,517
This guy's 6'11",

578
00:23:46,601 --> 00:23:48,802
300, easy. He's got his
teeth filed into canines.

579
00:23:48,853 --> 00:23:51,438
Tats everywhere. Oh, it gets better.

580
00:23:51,506 --> 00:23:53,524
So I turn around.

581
00:23:53,608 --> 00:23:56,110
I flex my left pec,
then I flex my right pec,

582
00:23:56,177 --> 00:23:58,195
and I say to the guy...

583
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:01,515
"L'eggo my Eggo."

584
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:04,401
And you know what he does?

585
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,203
He lets go of my Eggo.

586
00:24:06,287 --> 00:24:07,821
Right.

587
00:24:07,872 --> 00:24:09,490
You should be our nation's president.

588
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:10,541
Maybe.

589
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,026
I've been squeezing your leg

590
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:14,578
for, like, the last hour and a half.

591
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:16,029
Are you not attracted to me?

592
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:19,700
Sorry. I was really
distracted by our waitress.

593
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:24,054
She's totally into me.

594
00:24:24,139 --> 00:24:25,389
I can take that when you're ready.

595
00:24:28,476 --> 00:24:29,710
All right, guys. Let's move.

596
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:31,979
This meal has been comped.

597
00:24:32,046 --> 00:24:33,764
What?

598
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:35,182
Dude, I don't pay for food.

599
00:24:35,233 --> 00:24:36,350
It's my thing, yo.

600
00:24:36,401 --> 00:24:38,268
So we're going to dine and dash.

601
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:42,523
Let's go.

602
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:58,238
Do you need any change?

603
00:24:58,289 --> 00:24:59,873
Keep it.

604
00:24:59,924 --> 00:25:01,074
Thanks.

605
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:04,128
What the hell was that about?

606
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:06,046
Sorry. I couldn't do it.

607
00:25:06,114 --> 00:25:08,582
She gave us free refills.

608
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:09,850
And I figure she's got kids.

609
00:25:09,917 --> 00:25:11,084
I'm not gonna do that to her.

610
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:12,970
Whatever, dude. You wussed out.

611
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:14,304
So have fun taking the short bus home,

612
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:16,356
'cause I'll be escorting
these lovely ladies

613
00:25:16,424 --> 00:25:18,425
back to Chez Puckerman
for a little sookie-sookie.

614
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:19,560
Wait, seriously?

615
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:20,861
Damn straight.

616
00:25:20,928 --> 00:25:22,396
I'm giving you all
my trade secrets here.

617
00:25:22,447 --> 00:25:23,397
If you don't want my help, then fine.

618
00:25:23,448 --> 00:25:24,431
You're on your own.

(guys cheering)

WILL: Ladies, very, very impressive.

656
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:28,856
What was it that made you
guys choose those songs?

657
00:27:28,907 --> 00:27:29,940
Well...

658
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:31,859
Coach said to give you this.

659
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:42,369
Take a good look, William.

660
00:27:42,437 --> 00:27:45,172
Because Sue Sylvester's
got two things to show you.

661
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,207
To my left, I have one

662
00:27:47,275 --> 00:27:48,408
confetti cannon.

663
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:49,576
To my right,

664
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:51,461
you'll find another confetti cannon.

665
00:27:51,546 --> 00:27:52,913
You know what that means?

666
00:27:52,981 --> 00:27:55,015
(sighs) No, Sue.

667
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:58,268
We got Beiste fired.

668
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:01,021
And my full budget is restored.

669
00:28:01,089 --> 00:28:02,923
(remote beeps)

670
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:09,930
(laughing maniacally)

671
00:28:09,981 --> 00:28:11,698
Wait, what?

672
00:28:11,766 --> 00:28:12,866
Well, actually she quit.

673
00:28:12,934 --> 00:28:14,401
But I'll take the W.

674
00:28:14,452 --> 00:28:16,620
<i>And it was your kids
that made it happen, Will.</i>

675
00:28:16,704 --> 00:28:19,273
It finally occurred to them to
stop singing all that nonsense

676
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,490
about how awesome it is

677
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:23,126
to be alive or ugly or whatever

678
00:28:23,211 --> 00:28:24,711
the point is you guys
are always trying to make.

679
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:26,380
And instead?

680
00:28:26,447 --> 00:28:27,631
They just got mean.

681
00:28:29,817 --> 00:28:31,618
Congratulations, Will.

682
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:34,304
Wait, Coach Beiste quit?

683
00:28:34,389 --> 00:28:35,973
I believe I just said
that, Annie Sullivan.

684
00:28:36,057 --> 00:28:38,308
You want me to sign it into your palm?

685
00:28:38,393 --> 00:28:40,227
And, now, if you'll excuse me...

686
00:28:40,294 --> 00:28:43,313
And if you wouldn't mind
just cleaning all this up,

687
00:28:43,398 --> 00:28:44,982
that'd be great.

688
00:28:49,237 --> 00:28:51,071
(school bell rings)

689
00:29:07,154 --> 00:29:08,655
Hey!

690
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:11,825
I am talking to you!

691
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:13,126
Girls' locker room is next door.

692
00:29:13,177 --> 00:29:14,795
What is your problem?

693
00:29:14,846 --> 00:29:16,763
Excuse me? What are you so scared of?

694
00:29:16,831 --> 00:29:19,383
Besides you sneaking in
here to peek at my junk?

695
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:20,517
Oh, yeah, every straight guy's nightmare

696
00:29:20,601 --> 00:29:22,019
that all of us gays are secretly out

697
00:29:22,103 --> 00:29:24,054
to molest and convert you.
Well, guess what, ham hock?

698
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:26,556
You're not my type! That right?

699
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:28,025
Yes, I don't dig on chubby boys

700
00:29:28,109 --> 00:29:29,175
who sweat too much and
are going to be bald

701
00:29:29,227 --> 00:29:30,110
by the time they're 30.

702
00:29:30,177 --> 00:29:31,311
Do not push me, Hummel.

703
00:29:31,362 --> 00:29:32,512
You going to hit me?

704
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:34,731
Do it. Don't push me!

705
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:36,700
Hit me, 'cause it's not
going to change who I am.

706
00:29:36,784 --> 00:29:38,318
You can't punch the
gay out of me any more

707
00:29:38,369 --> 00:29:39,569
than I can punch the
ignoramus out of you!

708
00:29:39,654 --> 00:29:41,321
I said get out of my face!

709
00:29:41,372 --> 00:29:43,523
You are nothing but a scared
little boy who can't handle

710
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:45,542
how extraordinarily ordinary you are!

711
00:29:53,718 --> 00:29:55,218
(grunts in frustration)

712
00:30:07,149 --> 00:30:08,349
(school bell rings)

713
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:10,401
Well, I genuinely
hope you guys are happy

714
00:30:10,468 --> 00:30:12,703
because Coach Beiste has quit.

715
00:30:12,771 --> 00:30:15,156
Wait, what? That's terrible.

716
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,490
Yeah, that's not what we want.

717
00:30:16,575 --> 00:30:17,975
That's the opposite of what we want.

718
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:19,326
The football team was actually winning.

719
00:30:19,411 --> 00:30:20,711
Well, then, you'd better
put your heads together

720
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:22,279
and find a way to get her back, fast,

721
00:30:22,347 --> 00:30:24,999
because I am actually ashamed of you.

722
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:27,818
You really hurt someone who was
a great addition to this school.

723
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:29,587
I'm sorry, what exactly did we do?

724
00:30:29,654 --> 00:30:31,739
No, no. It's us. The boys.

725
00:30:31,807 --> 00:30:33,174
And Tina.

726
00:30:34,593 --> 00:30:37,011
We sort of figured out
that picturing Beiste

727
00:30:37,095 --> 00:30:38,996
while making out was even
better than a cold shower.

728
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:40,381
I-I mean, I don't...

729
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:42,099
Ever.

730
00:30:42,167 --> 00:30:44,501
Oh, wow. I'm sorry.

731
00:30:44,553 --> 00:30:45,720
SANTANA: Can I just say that this is

732
00:30:45,804 --> 00:30:46,971
what happens when people don't put out?

733
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:48,222
If everyone just put out,

734
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,473
we would have a winning football team.

735
00:30:49,524 --> 00:30:51,525
William.

736
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:54,478
I need to see you and Noah
Puckerman in my office, please.

737
00:30:57,015 --> 00:30:58,199
This is garbage!

738
00:30:58,283 --> 00:30:59,817
I've been doing my community service.

739
00:30:59,868 --> 00:31:01,152
When you wrote "hangin' with a crip"

740
00:31:01,203 --> 00:31:02,686
on your probation application,

741
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:04,705
we thought you were going to
do outreach with a local gang.

742
00:31:04,773 --> 00:31:06,373
But I've totally been helping Artie.

743
00:31:06,441 --> 00:31:08,525
I got him a date. I
made him some sweet cash.

744
00:31:08,577 --> 00:31:10,127
Please, Mr. Shue, you've
got to help me out here.

745
00:31:10,195 --> 00:31:12,329
Ms. Martin, there's
got to be some way Puck

746
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,697
can make up for this.

747
00:31:13,749 --> 00:31:14,832
He's been a model
student since he got back.

748
00:31:14,883 --> 00:31:16,500
Three whole days worth. Impressive.

749
00:31:16,568 --> 00:31:18,636
Look, there are rules.

750
00:31:18,703 --> 00:31:20,504
If Mr. Puckerman doesn't
find a suitable alternative

751
00:31:20,572 --> 00:31:21,972
for his community service by tomorrow,

752
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,457
his probation will be revoked,

753
00:31:23,525 --> 00:31:25,643
and he'll have to go back to
the Mondale School for the Boys.

754
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,311
Oh, screw that. I am
not going back there.

755
00:31:27,378 --> 00:31:29,180
Mr. Puckerman, calm down!

756
00:31:29,231 --> 00:31:30,181
No, you calm down!

757
00:31:30,232 --> 00:31:31,632
All of you, calm down!

758
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,567
I told you, I'm not going back there!

759
00:31:33,652 --> 00:31:35,052
What are you writing? Give me that.

760
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:36,887
Puck, this isn't helping!

761
00:31:36,938 --> 00:31:40,441
Helping? Since when does any
one of you care about helping me?

762
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:41,659
None of you care about me!

763
00:31:41,726 --> 00:31:42,860
(clattering)

764
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,835
(school bell rings)

765
00:31:50,902 --> 00:31:52,253
KURT: Thanks again for coming.

766
00:31:52,337 --> 00:31:54,839
Don't worry about it.
Just let me do the talking.

767
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:56,907
KURT: There he is.

768
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:59,460
I got your back.

769
00:31:59,544 --> 00:32:00,795
BLAINE: Excuse me?

770
00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:02,046
Hey, lady boys.

771
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:04,765
This your boyfriend, Kurt?

772
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,634
Kurt and I would like to
talk to you about something.

773
00:32:06,718 --> 00:32:08,269
I gotta go to class.

774
00:32:08,353 --> 00:32:09,720
Kurt told me what you did.

775
00:32:09,771 --> 00:32:12,556
Oh yeah, what's that?

776
00:32:12,607 --> 00:32:14,308
You kissed me.

777
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:16,443
I don't know what you're talking about.

778
00:32:16,528 --> 00:32:19,096
It seems like you might
be a little confused,

779
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:21,198
and that's totally normal.

780
00:32:21,266 --> 00:32:23,284
This is a... a very hard thing

781
00:32:23,368 --> 00:32:25,402
to come to terms with,
and you should just know

782
00:32:25,453 --> 00:32:27,822
that you're not alone.

783
00:32:27,906 --> 00:32:30,124
Do not mess with me.

784
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,109
You have to stop this!

785
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:48,259
Well, he's not coming out anytime soon.

786
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:56,466
What's going on?

787
00:32:57,635 --> 00:33:00,571
Why are you so upset?

788
00:33:00,638 --> 00:33:04,859
(exhales) Because up until
yesterday, I had never been kissed.

789
00:33:04,943 --> 00:33:07,978
Or at least... one that counted.

790
00:33:14,336 --> 00:33:16,170
Come on.

791
00:33:16,254 --> 00:33:18,289
I'll buy you lunch.

792
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:31,018
(sniffles)

793
00:33:36,474 --> 00:33:38,475
Didn't make you for a quitter.

794
00:33:38,526 --> 00:33:40,027
Don't, Will.

795
00:33:40,111 --> 00:33:42,346
You have no idea what it's like.

796
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:45,049
For what it's worth...
the kids feel awful.

797
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:48,068
They like you.

798
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:49,687
They respect you.

799
00:33:49,754 --> 00:33:53,807
Isn't that just what every
girl wants to hear from a guy?

800
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:56,693
Nah, screw this.

801
00:33:56,745 --> 00:33:59,079
I'll find my bliss somewhere else.

802
00:33:59,147 --> 00:34:01,966
I... I need a life change.

803
00:34:02,033 --> 00:34:06,754
You know, maybe I'll get a job
as a cooler at a honky-tonk bar.

804
00:34:06,838 --> 00:34:09,873
I don't know, maybe an ice road trucker.

805
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:11,175
Stop.

806
00:34:11,226 --> 00:34:13,210
Will you just stop?

807
00:34:13,261 --> 00:34:14,979
I get it.

808
00:34:15,046 --> 00:34:17,681
All of us are scarred by high school.

809
00:34:17,732 --> 00:34:20,818
You know, next to our parents,

810
00:34:20,885 --> 00:34:23,187
nothing screws a person up more.

811
00:34:23,238 --> 00:34:26,907
(laughs) And-and people
like us, we're stupid enough

812
00:34:26,992 --> 00:34:30,361
to come back here and
relive that pain every day.

813
00:34:30,412 --> 00:34:32,579
(laughs) Right? Yeah.

814
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:36,733
(sighs)

815
00:34:36,785 --> 00:34:38,702
I'm not gay, you know.

816
00:34:38,753 --> 00:34:42,189
I know I can be a little
intimidating sometimes, but...

817
00:34:42,257 --> 00:34:45,376
deep down inside where no one can see,

818
00:34:45,427 --> 00:34:48,345
I'm just a girl.

819
00:34:48,413 --> 00:34:53,467
A-Am I nuts that I just want to
be reminded of that sometimes?

820
00:34:54,803 --> 00:34:56,770
Well, that's what dating is for.

821
00:34:56,855 --> 00:35:00,941
(sighs) Last... date I went
on, the guy was a freak.

822
00:35:01,026 --> 00:35:03,160
All he wanted to do was wrestle.

823
00:35:03,228 --> 00:35:04,945
Well, let me help you out, then.

824
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:08,115
I'm sure there are plenty of
guys out... No, there aren't.

825
00:35:08,183 --> 00:35:10,234
I'm kind of a specific type.

826
00:35:10,301 --> 00:35:12,219
Well, you got to put yourself out there,

827
00:35:12,287 --> 00:35:13,404
try online dating...

828
00:35:13,455 --> 00:35:17,441
I've never been kissed, Will.

829
00:35:17,492 --> 00:35:18,876
(sighs)

830
00:35:18,943 --> 00:35:21,211
It's the simplest thing.

831
00:35:21,279 --> 00:35:22,946
A kiss.

832
00:35:23,014 --> 00:35:25,132
It's a doorway to everything else,

833
00:35:25,216 --> 00:35:26,100
you know?

834
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:28,752
Promise, hope...

835
00:35:28,803 --> 00:35:30,954
of a future with someone.

836
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:35,442
What does that say about me?

837
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:40,247
I'm 40, and I haven't even
taken those baby steps yet.

838
00:35:41,533 --> 00:35:43,233
♪ ♪

839
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:48,772
What that says to me...

840
00:35:48,823 --> 00:35:51,909
is that you are a beautiful...

841
00:35:51,976 --> 00:35:54,995
amazing woman...

842
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,648
whose heart is just too
big for most men to stand.

843
00:36:02,787 --> 00:36:05,923
You really think I'm pretty, Will?

844
00:36:07,092 --> 00:36:09,460
Inside and out.

845
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:21,221
♪ ♪

846
00:36:25,143 --> 00:36:28,345
And now you've been kissed.

847
00:36:28,396 --> 00:36:29,980
(laughs softly)

848
00:36:30,031 --> 00:36:33,067
Hey, come to the choir
room tomorrow at 4:00.

849
00:36:33,151 --> 00:36:35,536
The guys want to apologize to you

850
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,853
in person.

851
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:40,090
You tricking me into a
make-out session, Schuester?

852
00:36:40,158 --> 00:36:41,658
(both laugh)

853
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:47,999
(bell rings)

854
00:36:50,752 --> 00:36:52,870
I didn't see you in geometry today.

855
00:36:52,938 --> 00:36:54,822
Jackpot. No, you didn't.

856
00:36:54,873 --> 00:36:56,924
I'm getting out of here.

857
00:36:58,343 --> 00:37:00,094
I'm skipping town, genius.

858
00:37:00,161 --> 00:37:01,796
My probation officer
says hanging out with you

859
00:37:01,847 --> 00:37:03,998
isn't real community
service, so if I don't spend

860
00:37:04,049 --> 00:37:06,500
the next six weeks picking
up garbage on the highway,

861
00:37:06,552 --> 00:37:08,269
they're gonna send me back to juvie.

862
00:37:08,336 --> 00:37:10,170
So, what's wrong with picking up trash?

863
00:37:10,222 --> 00:37:12,223
Are you serious? It's ghetto, dude.

864
00:37:12,307 --> 00:37:13,841
I'm not a garbage man.

865
00:37:13,892 --> 00:37:15,693
You know how humiliating that is?

866
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:18,529
I'm not doing it, and I'm
not going back to juvie.

867
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:21,232
Why? I thought you loved it there.

868
00:37:21,316 --> 00:37:23,367
Yeah?

869
00:37:23,452 --> 00:37:25,786
I lied. It's frickin' terrifying, dude.

870
00:37:25,854 --> 00:37:27,738
On the first day, three
gangbangers jumped me,

871
00:37:27,806 --> 00:37:29,407
and before the security
guards could pull them off,

872
00:37:29,491 --> 00:37:30,891
they'd already tore out my nipple ring.

873
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:33,127
<i>I thought I was a badass?</i>

874
00:37:33,195 --> 00:37:34,745
There are some hard dudes in there.

875
00:37:34,813 --> 00:37:36,881
Guys with no families,
guys who look at you

876
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:39,000
like you're some kind
of dog they can't wait

877
00:37:39,067 --> 00:37:40,785
to kick the crap out of.

878
00:37:40,852 --> 00:37:42,970
And they kept taking my waffles.

879
00:37:44,873 --> 00:37:47,692
So... you be my community service.

880
00:37:47,759 --> 00:37:49,460
What?

881
00:37:49,528 --> 00:37:52,063
I owe you-- you got me
a date with Brittany.

882
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:55,232
You made me feel cool, which
is not the easiest thing to do.

883
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,351
I really like hanging out

884
00:37:57,419 --> 00:37:59,854
with you, so... let me
tutor you in geometry

885
00:37:59,905 --> 00:38:02,073
while you pick up
garbage by the highway.

886
00:38:03,258 --> 00:38:04,558
Geometry's easy, yo.

887
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:06,894
There's no excuse for
a guy as smart as you

888
00:38:06,962 --> 00:38:08,613
not to get at least a B.

889
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,583
I was kind of a jerk
to you at Breadstix.

890
00:38:12,651 --> 00:38:14,869
Whatever. Just pay
me back for the pasta.

891
00:38:14,936 --> 00:38:16,370

906
00:39:23,739 --> 00:39:25,356

00:39:25,424 --> 00:39:26,991
Coach Beiste, we think you're awesome.

908
00:39:27,059 --> 00:39:28,492
And even though you're
all hard and tough

Why don't you guys just get to the song.

916
00:39:39,337 --> 00:39:40,504
Totally.

917
00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:42,923
This mash-up is
dedicated to you, Coach.

918
00:39:42,991 --> 00:39:45,009
Hard and badass on one hand, and...

919
00:39:45,077 --> 00:39:46,961
soft and girly on the other.

920
00:39:47,028 --> 00:39:48,195
We hope it makes you smile,

921
00:39:48,263 --> 00:39:49,663
