1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,566
<i>So here's what
you missed on Glee:</i>

2
00:00:01,618 --> 00:00:02,951
<i>Coach Beiste is head over heels
for a guy</i>

3
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:04,420
<i>named Cooter
who's a football recruiter.</i>

4
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,425
<i>Rachel's running for class
president against Kurt and Brittany</i>

5
00:00:06,426 --> 00:00:07,400
and a guy from the hockey team.

6
00:00:07,492 --> 00:00:08,491
Vote Rick "The Stick"!

7
00:00:08,531 --> 00:00:10,081
<i>Burt's running for Congress
against Sue</i>

8
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:11,750
<i>and Reggie "The Sauce,"
this guy who owns a pizza chain</i>

9
00:00:11,801 --> 00:00:14,136
<i>and who's gonna air a
commercial that'll out Santana.</i>

10
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,138
Everyone's gonna know now,
because of you!

11
00:00:16,222 --> 00:00:17,139
<i>She thought the whole thing
was Finn's fault,</i>

12
00:00:17,223 --> 00:00:18,923
<i>so she slapped him really hard</i>

13
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:20,525
<i>in front of God and everybody.
Ouch.</i>

14
00:00:20,593 --> 00:00:22,613
<i>And that's what
you missed on Glee.</i>

15
00:00:22,715 --> 00:00:25,301
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

16
00:00:25,421 --> 00:00:27,789
I'm sorry, but since a student
had lit firecrackers

17
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:30,109
stuffed down his pants
three years ago,

18
00:00:30,177 --> 00:00:33,776
we've had a zero tolerance
physical violence policy.

19
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,132
Is that why you suspended
all the kids who have been

20
00:00:36,216 --> 00:00:38,918
tossing slushees in our faces
for the past two years?

21
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:41,671
Slushees are not on the school
board's approved list

22
00:00:41,755 --> 00:00:43,422
of suspend-worthy weapons.

23
00:00:43,474 --> 00:00:45,124
Here's what you have to
understand: I didn't do it.

24
00:00:45,175 --> 00:00:46,425
We all saw
what happened.

25
00:00:46,477 --> 00:00:48,177
You slapped Finn in the face,
unprovoked.

26
00:00:48,262 --> 00:00:49,628
No. See, you don't get it.

27
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,681
When I get really pissed off,
Santana gets taken over

28
00:00:51,765 --> 00:00:54,901
by my other evil personality.
I call her "Snixxx."

29
00:00:54,968 --> 00:00:57,069
Her wrath of words is called
"Snixxx juice."

30
00:00:57,137 --> 00:00:58,738
I'm kind of like
the Incredible Hulk.

31
00:00:58,805 --> 00:01:00,523
You can't blame me for anything
Snixxx does.

32
00:01:00,607 --> 00:01:03,109
I'm suspending you
and this Snixxx two weeks.

33
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,610
No argument.

34
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:07,479
Sectionals is next week.
If you suspend me, I won't be

35
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:09,282
able to beat Grimace
and Mr. Shue's butts.

36
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,284
Ms. Corcoran, I highly recommend
you do something about this.

37
00:01:11,335 --> 00:01:13,485
I'm sorry, Santana,
Sectionals is important,

38
00:01:13,537 --> 00:01:16,005
but you need to be
punished for what you did.

39
00:01:16,089 --> 00:01:17,656
I hate to say it, but I agree.

40
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:18,991
This is garbage.

41
00:01:19,042 --> 00:01:20,960
Hamburglar Finn is fine.

42
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:22,428
She didn't slap me.

43
00:01:22,495 --> 00:01:24,430
I know that it looked
and sounded like she did,

44
00:01:24,497 --> 00:01:26,465
but she actually didn't.

45
00:01:26,517 --> 00:01:28,184
What is it called in a play

46
00:01:28,268 --> 00:01:31,170
or a movie when you pretend to
hit someone but you don't?

47
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:32,605
SHELBY:
A stage slap?

48
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,307
It was a stage slap.

49
00:01:34,358 --> 00:01:35,641
That's what it was.

50
00:01:35,692 --> 00:01:37,777
- What is your angle here, Finn?
- The truth.

51
00:01:37,844 --> 00:01:39,362
If she didn't
actually hit me,

52
00:01:39,446 --> 00:01:40,713
then you can't
suspend her, right?

53
00:01:41,282 --> 00:01:42,481
No.

54
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:43,983
Then that's what happened.

55
00:01:44,034 --> 00:01:45,517
(bell rings)

56
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:46,786
I'm a mischievous bitch,

57
00:01:46,853 --> 00:01:48,871
but I can't for the life
of me figure out

58
00:01:48,956 --> 00:01:50,156
what the hell
this is about.

59
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:53,042
Well, I want Sectionals
to be a fair fight.

60
00:01:53,126 --> 00:01:55,107
And that can't happen without
you on the Trouble Tones.

61
00:01:55,185 --> 00:01:56,879
Well, actually, it would only be
a fair fight

62
00:01:56,964 --> 00:01:58,047
with me off the team.

63
00:01:58,131 --> 00:01:59,531
And I also kind of feel
bad for you.

64
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,133
Look, I know we've been
at each other a lot

65
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:02,251
over these past
couple of years,

66
00:02:02,336 --> 00:02:03,869
but the truth is I think
you're awesome.

67
00:02:03,921 --> 00:02:05,922
And when you hide
who you are,

68
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:07,256
I feel like you hide

69
00:02:07,341 --> 00:02:09,058
part of that awesomeness
with it.

70
00:02:09,142 --> 00:02:12,178
And that's why you act out

71
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:14,837
because you hurt inside...
every day.

72
00:02:17,436 --> 00:02:18,850
That's sweet...

73
00:02:19,436 --> 00:02:22,355
but if you think that,
in exchange for keeping me

74
00:02:22,406 --> 00:02:24,190
from getting suspended,
I'm gonna come...

75
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:26,025
- ...back to the Glee Club?
- Exactly.

76
00:02:26,076 --> 00:02:27,860
You and all the Trouble Tones.
I have an idea

77
00:02:27,887 --> 00:02:31,230
for a lesson but it won't work
out if you're not there.

78
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:33,732
Did Ms. Corcoran and Mr. Shue
already agree to this?

79
00:02:33,784 --> 00:02:35,868
Look, it's up to you.

80
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,204
Either you can come back
to the choir room

81
00:02:38,255 --> 00:02:41,540
and embrace your awesome
or take a two-week vacation

82
00:02:41,592 --> 00:02:43,626
and enjoy your seat in the
audience for Sectionals.

83
00:02:51,018 --> 00:02:52,635
(bell ringing)

84
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,854
<i>RACHEL: I haven't been
this worried about a vote</i>

85
00:02:54,921 --> 00:02:56,422
<i>since Lambert versus Allen.</i>

86
00:02:56,473 --> 00:02:59,058
<i>Kurt needs this election
to get into NYADA.</i>

87
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:01,611
<i>More importantly, he's
clearly the superior candidate.</i>

88
00:03:01,695 --> 00:03:03,380
<i>I mean, come on.</i>

89
00:03:03,412 --> 00:03:04,029
If elected,

90
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,499
I will make sure to have sugary
treats available at all times.

91
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,640
It helps the concentration.

92
00:03:07,672 --> 00:03:08,976
That's what
George Washington said.

93
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:10,093
<i>I had to take a stand.</i>

94
00:03:10,117 --> 00:03:12,071
She's bribing the students
with Pixy Stix.

95
00:03:12,122 --> 00:03:13,205
Buying votes is illegal.

96
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:14,740
It's also delicious.

97
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,242
<i>Nobody cares.</i>

98
00:03:16,293 --> 00:03:17,994
<i>They're all so lost
in their own worlds</i>

99
00:03:18,078 --> 00:03:20,112
<i>that they can't see how
important this is to me.</i>

100
00:03:20,163 --> 00:03:22,298
<i>Elections have consequences,</i>

101
00:03:22,382 --> 00:03:24,717
<i>and the consequence of Brittany
winning this election is</i>

102
00:03:24,784 --> 00:03:27,670
<i>that I'll have to move to
New York without my best gay.</i>

103
00:03:27,754 --> 00:03:29,388
<i>What if I need
an emergency makeover</i>

104
00:03:29,456 --> 00:03:30,878
<i>or a last-minute soufflé?</i>

105
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:32,791
JACOB: How's the concession
speech going?

106
00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:34,977
Can I print
an early copy on my blog?

107
00:03:35,062 --> 00:03:36,812
Who says I'm ready to concede?

108
00:03:36,897 --> 00:03:39,065
I'm leading that hockey playing
kid by ten percent.

109
00:03:39,132 --> 00:03:40,349
But that's mostly because

110
00:03:40,434 --> 00:03:41,901
he's in a medically
induced coma after

111
00:03:41,968 --> 00:03:43,235
being brutally checked
in a game last week.

112
00:03:43,303 --> 00:03:45,637
Also, you're trailing Brittany
by 17 points.

113
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:47,772
If this was a horse race,
you'd be glue.

114
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:50,076
And te glue that keeps
this school together

115
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:51,410
when he gets
elected president.

116
00:03:51,478 --> 00:03:53,570
Oh, my God, it's Brittany.
Madam President?

117
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,394
Don't worry about it, okay?

118
00:03:55,434 --> 00:03:57,983
We still have the rest of the day
to change the minds of the voters.

119
00:03:58,035 --> 00:03:59,201
What's the point?

120
00:03:59,286 --> 00:04:00,920
I'm gonna lose unless
I pull a JFK.

121
00:04:00,987 --> 00:04:03,255
(hushed):
You're gonna shoot Brittany?

122
00:04:03,323 --> 00:04:06,709
No, no... when Kennedy ran
against Nixon in 1960,

123
00:04:06,793 --> 00:04:09,962
he had all his Mob buddies in
Chicago stuff the ballot boxes

124
00:04:10,013 --> 00:04:11,130
so that he would win
Illinois.

125
00:04:11,181 --> 00:04:12,664
It won him the presidency.

126
00:04:12,716 --> 00:04:13,849
Wait... No!

127
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:15,468
No, I can't
let you do this, okay?

128
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,137
Come on. Can't we just do, like,
a great duet in the cafeteria

129
00:04:18,188 --> 00:04:20,102
or the library to just
drum up some support?

130
00:04:20,179 --> 00:04:21,946
I have Kennedy's
impeccable hairline.

131
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:22,532
I know.

132
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:25,336
Why can't I have his ends-
justify-the-means mentality?

133
00:04:25,461 --> 00:04:28,047
If I lose, and my resume
remains blank,

134
00:04:28,115 --> 00:04:29,848
I'm not gonna get into NYADA.

135
00:04:30,442 --> 00:04:32,120
And I can't accept that.

136
00:04:33,236 --> 00:04:35,488
You're seriously
considering cheating?

137
00:04:37,224 --> 00:04:39,492
What choice do I have?

138
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,212
(bell ringing)

139
00:04:45,114 --> 00:04:47,499
Can someone tell us
what's going on, please?

140
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,954
This week, the Trouble Tones
and New Directions!

141
00:04:49,996 --> 00:04:51,404
will both be
singing music created

142
00:04:51,428 --> 00:04:53,643
- by ladies and for ladies.
- Oh, hell no.

143
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:55,512
Next week, all of us will be
going to Sectionals,

144
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:57,207
and one of us is
probably gonna win.

145
00:04:57,417 --> 00:04:59,849
But, Santana, we're
worried about you.

146
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:01,647
Worry about yourself,
fetus face.

147
00:05:01,714 --> 00:05:05,384
Glee's about learning how to
accept yourself for who you are,

148
00:05:05,435 --> 00:05:06,530
no matter
what other people think.

149
00:05:06,577 --> 00:05:07,987
And that's what this music
is all about.

150
00:05:08,034 --> 00:05:10,906
So, wait, I don't even
get a say in this? Not cool.

151
00:05:11,508 --> 00:05:13,784
Everybody in this room knows
about you and Brittany.

152
00:05:13,823 --> 00:05:15,478
And we don't judge
you for it.

153
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:17,502
We celebrate it
because it's who you are.

154
00:05:17,781 --> 00:05:19,582
Look, I know not everybody
outside of this room

155
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,367
is as accepting and cool,

156
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:24,336
but we're doing this assignment
this week so that you know

157
00:05:24,404 --> 00:05:28,114
in this rotten, stinking mean
world that you at least have

158
00:05:28,146 --> 00:05:30,065
a group of people who
will support your choice

159
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:31,338
to be whoever
you want to be.

160
00:05:31,578 --> 00:05:32,445
That's it.

161
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,140
That's what
we're doing here.

162
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:36,209
Blaine? Kurt?

163
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:39,718
Santana, Kurt and I have a song

164
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:41,473
we like to sing to
each other in the car.

165
00:05:41,483 --> 00:05:43,622
And we want to sing
that for you right now.

166
00:05:43,673 --> 00:05:45,657
While there's nothing I'd love
more than having

167
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:48,461
two Pretty Ponies serenade me,
I think we'd get further

168
00:05:48,512 --> 00:05:51,263
staging a "gel-ervention" for
Blaine than singing lady music.

169
00:05:51,331 --> 00:05:54,133
I know it's hard.
It was hard for me, too.

170
00:05:54,184 --> 00:05:55,434
But you can get
through this.

171
00:05:55,502 --> 00:05:57,186
If you could just stop
being so defensive.

172
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,139
I'm trying, but your hideous
bow ties are provoking me.

173

on lady or girl on girl?

a big difference.

to keep up my strength.

253

more, well, busier lately.

anything, just let us know.

00:10:08,224 --> 00:10:10,802

me to do something

262
00:10:10,803 --> 00:10:12,619
I never imagined I'd be doing.

263
00:10:14,516 --> 00:10:16,523
You think you can
handle this, Shannon?

264
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,267
Give it to me, Cooter.

I met my match.

but whatever, happy to oblige,
always.

310
00:13:29,403 --> 00:13:31,849
- You kicked ass on that song.
- Thank you.

311
00:13:32,052 --> 00:13:34,185
Do think you need to get
your eyes checked, though.

312
00:13:34,236 --> 00:13:35,415
Say what?

313
00:13:35,491 --> 00:13:38,340
You sang almost the whole song to Shelby.
You hardly even noticed me.

314
00:13:38,388 --> 00:13:40,713
Yeah, that was so that
she would think of me...

315
00:13:40,848 --> 00:13:41,485
think of us...

316
00:13:41,486 --> 00:13:44,034
as the only ones that could
take care of Beth and stuff.

317
00:13:44,267 --> 00:13:46,385
The song was mainly about
baby-sitting for me.

318
00:13:47,063 --> 00:13:50,856
Look, my mom is going on a
Christian wine-tasting boat

319
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,558
down the Ohio River
on Friday.

320
00:13:52,642 --> 00:13:54,109
The Jesus Booze Cruise.

321
00:13:54,177 --> 00:13:56,081
So I'm going to have
the house to myself.

322
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,470
Want to come over, order in,

323
00:13:58,532 --> 00:14:00,639
rent a movie and not watch it?

324
00:14:01,616 --> 00:14:03,467
Remember in the hospital
after Beth was born?

325
00:14:04,274 --> 00:14:05,844
You told me you loved me.

326
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:07,623
We can get that back.

327
00:14:08,395 --> 00:14:09,875
Sorry. Not interested.

328
00:14:10,425 --> 00:14:12,585
Let me be more clear.

329
00:14:13,213 --> 00:14:15,798
If you come over on Friday,

330
00:14:15,865 --> 00:14:18,200
you get to have sex with me.

331
00:14:18,633 --> 00:14:21,474
Look, I was into you
pretty hard a couple years ago

332
00:14:21,503 --> 00:14:23,366
'cause you were hot
like a pixie and I thought

333
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:25,205
you were pretty much cooler than
every other girl in the school,

334
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:27,699
but turns out,
you're kind of nuts.

335
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:30,479
You're higher maintenance than
Berry and pretty much the most

336
00:14:30,546 --> 00:14:31,814
selfish person I've ever
met in my life.

337
00:14:31,881 --> 00:14:33,381
So thanks for the offer,

338
00:14:33,433 --> 00:14:35,851
but I'd rather
raw dog a beehive.

of the new assignment?

00:14:43,893 --> 00:14:45,494
It's pretty sweet, right?

342
00:14:45,561 --> 00:14:46,895
Do you realize
you're basically

343
00:14:46,946 --> 00:14:49,081
forcing me out
of the flannel closet?

344
00:14:49,165 --> 00:14:50,565
Salazar's ad's going to run.

345
00:14:50,617 --> 00:14:51,950
That's what's forcing
you to deal with this.

346
00:14:52,035 --> 00:14:53,786
Why are you getting
so worked up about this?

347
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,671
'Cause I don't want
you to die.

348
00:14:56,305 --> 00:14:57,873
A few weeks ago,
some kid who made one

349
00:14:57,924 --> 00:14:59,708
of those "It Gets Better"
videos killed himself.

350
00:15:00,087 --> 00:15:02,093
You deal with your anxiety
surrounding this stuff

351
00:15:02,094 --> 00:15:03,176
by attacking other people,

352
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,664
and someday, that's not
going to be enough

353
00:15:04,665 --> 00:15:05,998
and you might start
attacking yourself.

354
00:15:06,034 --> 00:15:07,861
Well, thanks, but that's
never going to happen.

355
00:15:07,862 --> 00:15:08,699
I'd miss me too much.

356
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,121
Look, you were my first.

357
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,112
That means something to me.

358
00:15:13,826 --> 00:15:15,042
You mean something to me.

359
00:15:15,093 --> 00:15:16,793
If something ever were
to happen to you,

360
00:15:16,878 --> 00:15:18,157
and I didn't do
everything that I could

361
00:15:18,203 --> 00:15:20,738
to try and stop it, I'd never
be able to live with myself.

362

We love you, Santana.

386
00:17:55,228 --> 00:17:56,620
(bell ringing)

387
00:17:56,704 --> 00:18:00,590
One four-cheese, ass-kickin',
triple-dippin' chicken taquitos.

388
00:18:00,675 --> 00:18:02,709
Double the chicken.

389
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,645
One Big Daddy Chicken Patty
with extra chicken.

390
00:18:05,713 --> 00:18:07,130
And instead of a side...

391
00:18:07,215 --> 00:18:09,099
- More chicken...
- you just want more chicken.

392
00:18:09,183 --> 00:18:11,456
Yeah. Smile for the camera.

393
00:18:12,136 --> 00:18:14,771
<i>Get those to
the Lima Times ASAP.</i>

394
00:18:14,856 --> 00:18:16,189
Sure thing, Coach.

395
00:18:16,257 --> 00:18:17,107
BEISTE:
Hey, Cooter.

396
00:18:17,191 --> 00:18:18,424
What are you doing here?

397
00:18:18,476 --> 00:18:19,459
Oh, hey, Coach.

398
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:22,562
Just, uh... just grabbing
some dinner with Sue here.

399
00:18:22,613 --> 00:18:25,949
Excuse me, Bluto, but I'm
on a date with my man,

400
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:28,268
enjoying some disgusting
creamy pasta,

401
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:30,771
and phoners with several
major media outlets.

402
00:18:30,838 --> 00:18:32,539
So why don't you just
hurry on to your next

403
00:18:32,606 --> 00:18:33,778
face-widening session

404
00:18:33,817 --> 00:18:36,243

and Facial Weight Gain.

406
00:18:37,662 --> 00:18:38,611
You're on a date?

407
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:41,146
Y... Yeah, I guess.

408
00:18:41,263 --> 00:18:42,427
Listen, Home Perm,

409
00:18:42,505 --> 00:18:43,722
Cooter's been my
regular booty call

410
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:45,518
(phone vibrates)
since the late 1990s...

411
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:49,344
Oop! My iPhone 5 is vibrating.
That's a new feature

412
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:51,635
of the iPhone 5...
they vibrate now.

413
00:18:51,862 --> 00:18:54,483
<i>And I have to take this... it's
a reporter from USA Today,</i>

414
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:56,785
the newspaper for people
who can't read.

415
00:19:00,356 --> 00:19:01,523
It's nice to see you, Cooter.

416
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,580
Hey, Shannon, Shannon...

417
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:06,441
You okay?

418
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:07,813
No.

419
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,082
(voice breaking):
No, I'm not.

420
00:19:11,171 --> 00:19:14,886
I thought you and I were
doing stuff, and stuff.

421
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:16,855
Shannon, I didn't think
you were interested.

422
00:19:17,027 --> 00:19:19,778
Every time I gather up the courage
to ask you out on a date,

423
00:19:19,818 --> 00:19:23,588
we end up lifting weights at
the gym or at a protein seminar.

424
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:25,768
So, last time, I said to
myself, "Dang it, Coot,"

425
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,048
you just gotta make a move."

426
00:19:27,512 --> 00:19:29,129
And so I tried
to hold your hand,

427
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:31,319
- and you punched me.
- It was a reflex.

428
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:33,572
I thought you were trying
to steal my class ring.

429
00:19:33,656 --> 00:19:36,391
I like you, Shannon, and I
like hanging out with you,

430
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:38,243
but the truth is,
I can't tell

431
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:40,779
what's going on with us.
I'm not looking for a buddy.

432
00:19:40,863 --> 00:19:42,415
I'm a grown man.

433
00:19:43,404 --> 00:19:44,905
I mean, I need more than that.

434
00:19:57,316 --> 00:20:00,485
I don't have to ask who you
lovely ladies are voting for.

435
00:20:00,553 --> 00:20:03,772
- I'm Team Britt all the way.
- I'm voting for the hockey player.

436
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,654
Rick "The Stick" Nelson.

437
00:20:05,816 --> 00:20:07,431
Well, I wouldn't worry too much

438
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,444
about a spare vote
here or there, Brittany.

439
00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:13,481
My exit polling is putting you
well ahead of Lady Hummel.

440
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:16,325
This election is "ovah"!

441
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:17,703
That's right!

442
00:20:17,754 --> 00:20:19,037
Come on.

443
00:20:20,109 --> 00:20:21,893
One last interview
before you lose.

444
00:20:21,944 --> 00:20:24,279
- Hey, hey, hey, give it a break.
- Hey, just one more! Just a word!

445
00:20:24,363 --> 00:20:26,763
God, I feel like a lamb waiting
in line to be slaughtered.

446
00:20:26,807 --> 00:20:27,638
Chin up, Kurt.

447
00:20:27,785 --> 00:20:29,101
It's not over till all
the votes are counted.

448
00:20:29,171 --> 00:20:30,655
Yep, and you're
going to get loads.

449
00:20:30,706 --> 00:20:32,590
Look, look, Quinn is going into
the voting booth right now.

450
00:20:32,658 --> 00:20:34,459
She's definitely going
to vote for you.

451
00:20:36,896 --> 00:20:39,497
<i>QUINN: I like what Kurt stands
for, and Brittany is insane,</i>

452
00:20:39,565 --> 00:20:41,633
<i>but just like my dad always
voted for the candidate</i>

453
00:20:41,701 --> 00:20:43,218
<i>that was least ethnic,</i>

454
00:20:43,302 --> 00:20:45,670
<i>I'm voting for the one
who's most girl.</i>

455
00:20:45,721 --> 00:20:48,139
<i>MERCEDES: Brittany is
my Trouble Tones home girl,</i>

456
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,891
<i>but thank God
for secret ballots</i>

457
00:20:49,976 --> 00:20:51,810
<i>because if Santana's
girlfriend wins this election</i>

458
00:20:51,861 --> 00:20:54,145
<i>I'm never going to hear
the end of it.</i>

459
00:21:09,819 --> 00:21:12,831
<i>KURT: If I lose, I don't have a
chance of getting into NYADA.</i>

460
00:21:12,882 --> 00:21:15,000
<i>It's not fair...
the difference between</i>

461
00:21:15,051 --> 00:21:17,252
<i>my dreams coming true and
managing a Sonic Burger</i>

462
00:21:17,336 --> 00:21:20,338
<i>depends on how many people
check a stupid box.</i>

463
00:21:27,361 --> 00:21:28,894
Hey, how's it going?

464
00:21:28,946 --> 00:21:31,414
I can't believe I agreed to let
District hold polling places

465
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,898
in our gym today.

466
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,750
It's like she's
rubbing it in my face.

467
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,419
Don't take it personally.

468
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,838
It's all just a big campaign
strategy for her.

469
00:21:38,905 --> 00:21:41,073
Coach Sue wants
you to have this.

470
00:21:41,124 --> 00:21:42,908
She says she hopes
it rubs it in your face.

471
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,514
I don't understand
what happened.

472
00:21:48,582 --> 00:21:50,266
He said I was
uncommunicative.

473
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:53,419
Aw, man, I'm so bummed out,
I feel like I'm living

474
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,921
one of the tragic
country music songs.

475
00:21:55,973 --> 00:21:57,974
Well, then you need to go
tell him how you feel.

476
00:21:58,058 --> 00:22:01,049
WILL: We're going to go vote, and
you just got to go for it, okay?

477
00:22:01,132 --> 00:22:02,782
When this is all
over and done with,

478
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:06,194
Sue's going to lose
the election and the guy.

479
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,335

512
00:24:16,101 --> 00:24:18,135
JOSH:
Saw the commercial.

513
00:24:18,186 --> 00:24:19,737
Whew. Smokin'.

514
00:24:19,804 --> 00:24:21,322
Who the hell are you?

515
00:24:21,406 --> 00:24:23,574
Josh Comen.
Sophomore rugby captain.

516
00:24:23,642 --> 00:24:24,942
Girls like you
are a challenge.

517
00:24:24,993 --> 00:24:26,777
You just need the right
guy to straighten you out,

518
00:24:26,828 --> 00:24:28,611
and I'm just
the man to do it.

519
00:24:28,861 --> 00:24:31,200
Move your busted creeper ass.

520
00:24:31,348 --> 00:24:31,982
Now.

521
00:24:32,034 --> 00:24:34,485
Easy, girls. I'm just trying
to make her normal.

522
00:24:34,536 --> 00:24:36,153
- She is normal.
- It's not a choice, idiot.

523
00:24:36,204 --> 00:24:38,005
But even if it were,
you'd be our last choice.

524
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:41,125
Oh, I get it.
You're all a bunch of lesbos.

525
00:24:41,176 --> 00:24:44,378
So what if we are? You don't
stand a chance either way.

526
00:24:44,403 --> 00:24:45,964
RACHEL:
Bye-bye.

527
00:24:45,999 --> 00:24:47,382

SANTANA:
Okay, okay. Update, y'all.

563
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,634
Um, I told my parents
last night,

564
00:26:46,718 --> 00:26:48,002
and they were actually
okay with it.

565
00:26:48,086 --> 00:26:49,754
No way!

566
00:26:49,805 --> 00:26:51,288
I just have to tell my Abuela

567
00:26:51,339 --> 00:26:52,506
before she sees that
stupid commercial.

568
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:54,507
But luckily she only
watches Univision.

569
00:26:55,353 --> 00:26:58,012
Excuse me, New Directions! and
Trouble Tones singing groups.

570
00:26:58,096 --> 00:27:01,649
Mr. Kurt Hummel, I need to see
you in my office immediately.

571
00:27:06,321 --> 00:27:07,325
First of all, Mr. Hummel,

572
00:27:07,378 --> 00:27:10,018
congratulations on your
early exit poll numbers.

573
00:27:10,202 --> 00:27:12,430
Things are looking very
good indeed for you.

574
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:15,333
Thank you, Figgins. Now can you
tell me why I'm here today?

575
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,752
There seems to have been
some irregularities

576
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,754
with the student
council ballot boxes.

577
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,839
What do you mean
by irregularities?

578
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,425
Kurt won...
but by 190 votes.

579
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:25,771
Well, that's great!

580
00:27:26,685 --> 00:27:27,511
Right?

581
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:28,577
Well, the problem
is there's more

582
00:27:28,624 --> 00:27:30,804
ballots than there are seniors,

583
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:33,384
and Kurt won by a
suspiciously wide margin.

584
00:27:33,435 --> 00:27:35,885
No, no, I-I didn't do it.

585
00:27:36,438 --> 00:27:38,356
I didn't cheat, I mean, I mean
I thought about it, but I-I-I...

586
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,557
What do you mean
you thought about it?

587
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:43,828
I... I thought about it because
I-I-I wanted to win so badly,

588
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,329
and I was worried
that I wouldn't.

589
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:48,427
But, but, I didn't cheat.
I-I worked really hard on this.

590
00:27:49,841 --> 00:27:51,168
I didn't cheat!

591
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:52,587
(bell ringing)

592
00:27:53,068 --> 00:27:54,635
Someone stuffed
the ballot boxes.

593
00:27:55,066 --> 00:27:56,303
They think I did it.

594
00:27:56,355 --> 00:27:58,022
If they can prove it,
I could be suspended.

595
00:27:58,106 --> 00:27:59,774
- Oh, my God, Kurt...
- And I lost.

596
00:28:00,255 --> 00:28:01,659
I lost the election.

597
00:28:01,743 --> 00:28:03,977
<i>I lost the lead
in West Side Story.</i>

598
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:05,496
I can forget about
New York and NYADA,

599
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,980
'cause they'll never
take me now.

600
00:28:07,032 --> 00:28:09,033
You know, the worst part
is that I really,

601
00:28:09,117 --> 00:28:10,284
for a second, thought I won.

602
00:28:10,335 --> 00:28:11,752
Kurt, I'm-I'm so sorry...

603
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,254
I have to find Blaine.

604
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,634
Rachel, I want you to
know, I didn't do this.

605
00:28:17,661 --> 00:28:18,377
I did it.

606
00:28:19,011 --> 00:28:20,961
What? What were you thinking?

607
00:28:21,013 --> 00:28:22,254
I-I-I... I wasn't thinking.

608
00:28:22,287 --> 00:28:24,692
I-I just... I wanted
to help him so bad.

I'm sorry, I shouldn't have
called you, I just...

629

- I don't have anybody else.
- Is she okay?

630
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,520
She's with the doctor.
She slipped and

631
00:29:24,588 --> 00:29:27,106
hit her lip on the floor,
and there was blood everywhere.

632
00:29:27,191 --> 00:29:28,775
I turned my back
for three seconds.

633
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:30,026
I'm freaking out now.

634
00:29:30,093 --> 00:29:31,260
They won't even let me
in the room with her.

635
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:32,979
It's cool. I'm here now.

636
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:34,981
DOCTOR: Hi. Uh, her bottom
tooth went through her lip.

637
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:36,699
Couple stitches, she'll be fine.

638
00:29:36,767 --> 00:29:39,335
Really? Wait. I want her to
see a plastic surgeon first.

639
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,571
Well, I've gen
plenty of stitches.

640
00:29:41,622 --> 00:29:44,273
I live a somewhat active
lifestyle... judo, paintball...

641
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:46,459
which means I've had more
stitches than Frankenstein,

642
00:29:46,543 --> 00:29:47,961
so if anyone's gonna
touch Beth's face,

643
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:50,007
it's gonna be
a plastic surgeon.

644
00:29:50,379 --> 00:29:51,983
I'll page her.

645
00:29:56,138 --> 00:29:58,112
It's okay.
I'm here now.

646
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:00,097
Everything's gonna be okay.

647
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:07,146
Yeah. I did a good job.

648
00:30:07,231 --> 00:30:08,598
You're very pretty.

649
00:30:08,649 --> 00:30:11,133
You know, the advantage
of a relationship

650
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:14,187
with a younger dude is that I
still got four me rounds in me

651
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:15,655
before I need a steak
sandwich and a Coke Zero.

652
00:30:15,739 --> 00:30:17,774
You need to go.

653
00:30:17,825 --> 00:30:19,742
Before Beth wakes up.

654
00:30:20,911 --> 00:30:22,779
This was a mistake.

655
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,614
I was a mess at the hospital.

656
00:30:24,665 --> 00:30:26,199
Yeah, I was like
freakin' Wolverine.

657
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:27,867
Beth would have a big
scar on her lip

658
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,437
for the rest of her life
if it weren't for me.

659
00:30:29,753 --> 00:30:32,705
Okay. This is just wrong. Go.

660
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:33,873
Please. Go.

661
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,208
You know what?

662
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:36,492
Screw you.

663
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,211
Yeah, you got
the boom and the pow,

664
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:40,513
and your lips are cash money,
but what really turned me on

665
00:30:40,597 --> 00:30:42,432
about you was how much of
an ass-kicker you were.

666
00:30:42,499 --> 00:30:43,883
Winning all those
championships,

667
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:47,002
going to New York, raising
Beth alone... all garbage.

668
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:49,305
This was your chance to
get in on the ground floor

669
00:30:49,356 --> 00:30:51,107
of something really
special... me.

670
00:30:52,095 --> 00:30:54,685
But you're too much of
a coward to go for it.

671
00:31:01,438 --> 00:31:03,672
Santana,
you're all bones.

672
00:31:03,724 --> 00:31:05,845
Like Jesus on the cross.
Eat.

673
00:31:05,908 --> 00:31:08,667
Abuelita, I have something that
I want to talk to you about...

674
00:31:08,697 --> 00:31:11,607
Okay, who cares, talk
with your mouth full, hm?

675
00:31:12,566 --> 00:31:14,350
No, no, no. Come on.

676
00:31:14,401 --> 00:31:16,185
Come on.
Hmm?

677
00:31:16,236 --> 00:31:18,520
(speaking Spanish)

678
00:31:18,572 --> 00:31:20,156
Ah. Okay.

679
00:31:20,207 --> 00:31:22,024
(speaking Spanish)

680
00:31:24,998 --> 00:31:26,143
Look...

681
00:31:26,825 --> 00:31:29,715
I have to tell you a secret;
a secret that I've

682
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,385
- kept hidden for a long time, but...
- You need salsa...?

683
00:31:32,469 --> 00:31:33,688
<i>No, no, no. Escúchame.</i>

684
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,132
Please...

685
00:31:35,866 --> 00:31:38,244
- You're so special to me.
- Santana, are you pregnant?

686
00:31:38,276 --> 00:31:39,861
Because I will beat you
up with this chair.

687
00:31:39,862 --> 00:31:40,978
No, it's not... it's not that.

688
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:41,781
Okay.

689
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:44,516
It's just that I've
watched you my whole life.

690
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:48,156
And you've always
been so strong.

691
00:31:49,113 --> 00:31:50,993
Done exactly what you believe,

692
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,657
and never cared about what
anyone else thought of you...

693
00:31:53,867 --> 00:31:56,381
Tell me about your life,
I know mine.

694
00:31:56,916 --> 00:31:58,767
Abuelita...

695
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:03,921
I love girls

696
00:32:04,707 --> 00:32:07,158
the way that I'm supposed
to feel about boys.

697
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,979
It's just something that's
always been inside of me,

698
00:32:11,063 --> 00:32:12,814
and I really want to
share it with you

699
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:14,699
because I love you so much.

700
00:32:15,211 --> 00:32:16,812
I want you to know me.

701
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,497
Who I really am.

702
00:32:19,233 --> 00:32:20,788
When I'm with Brittany...

703
00:32:21,676 --> 00:32:23,658
I finally understand what
people are talking about

704
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:25,660
when they talk about love.

705
00:32:26,961 --> 00:32:28,450
I've tried so hard

706
00:32:28,485 --> 00:32:31,821
to push this feeling away,
and keep it locked inside...

707
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:34,874
but every day just
feels like a war.

708
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:38,026
I walk around so
mad at the world,

709
00:32:38,078 --> 00:32:40,079
but I'm really just
fighting with myself.

710
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,446
I don't want to fight anymore.

711
00:32:45,593 --> 00:32:47,391
I'm just too tired.

712
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:50,234
I have to just be me.

713
00:32:53,426 --> 00:32:54,777
Say something, please.

714
00:32:56,051 --> 00:32:58,397
Everyone has secrets, Santana.

715
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:00,816
They're called secrets
for a reason.

716
00:33:01,739 --> 00:33:03,485
I want you to leave this house.

717
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:05,765
I don't ever want
to see you again.

718
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,744
- Abuela, you...
- Go.

719
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,673
- You don't...
- Now.

720
00:33:09,741 --> 00:33:12,186
I'm the same person
I was a minute ago.

721
00:33:12,238 --> 00:33:13,605
You made your choice.

722
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:15,377
Now I have made mine.

723
00:33:16,874 --> 00:33:18,284
But why?

724
00:33:19,132 --> 00:33:22,571
It's selfish of you
to make me uncomfortable.

725
00:33:22,622 --> 00:33:24,173
(speaking Spanish)

726
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,209
The sin isn't
in the thing,

727
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:30,129
it's in the scandal,
when people talk about it aloud.

728
00:33:30,784 --> 00:33:32,204
So you're saying
it would've been better

729
00:33:32,241 --> 00:33:33,675
if I would've
kept this a secret?

730
00:33:40,205 --> 00:33:40,954
(quietly):
Abuela...

731
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,318
(sobs)

732
00:33:53,821 --> 00:33:55,271
I didn't bring protection.

733
00:33:55,322 --> 00:33:56,873
It's okay. I don't care.

734
00:33:58,483 --> 00:34:00,751
Under normal circumstances,
I'd take my chances,

735
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:02,703
but we have a pretty
crappy track record.

736
00:34:02,788 --> 00:34:04,822
Maybe we'll get
lucky again.

737
00:34:04,873 --> 00:34:06,246
You mean unlucky.

738
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,481
Look, trying to get Beth
back was a stupid idea.

739
00:34:09,806 --> 00:34:10,956
You're just figuring
this out now?

740
00:34:11,046 --> 00:34:12,163
But we made one
perfect baby.

741
00:34:12,214 --> 00:34:13,839
We can make another.

742
00:34:14,383 --> 00:34:16,350
We have
everything we need.

743
00:34:16,435 --> 00:34:17,668
Wait...

744
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,550
Is this why you
invited me over?

745
00:34:21,273 --> 00:34:23,224
See, this is what happens
when you have anger sex.

746
00:34:23,308 --> 00:34:24,358
Why are you
angry at me?

747
00:34:24,443 --> 00:34:25,726
Fine! You don't want this?

748
00:34:25,811 --> 00:34:27,311
There's 20 other guys
at this school who would

749
00:34:27,362 --> 00:34:29,530
kill to give me what I want;
they would kill to love me.

750
00:34:30,029 --> 00:34:32,397
I'm not angry at you.
I let you down.

751
00:34:33,058 --> 00:34:34,158
We all did.

752
00:34:35,237 --> 00:34:36,237
You just spent a whole week

753
00:34:36,321 --> 00:34:37,265
helping Santana with a secret

754
00:34:37,285 --> 00:34:38,702
everybody already knows,
and not one person

755
00:34:38,781 --> 00:34:40,848
took ten seconds
to help you.

756
00:34:41,743 --> 00:34:43,027
And you're a frickin' mess.

757
00:34:44,362 --> 00:34:45,796
You have been for three years.

758
00:34:47,499 --> 00:34:49,102
Ever since I knocked you up.

759
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,973
You don't need a baby
or a dude

760
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:57,508
or anyone to make you special.

761
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:00,011
If there's one person
that I'm sure

762
00:35:00,062 --> 00:35:03,116
is gonna get the hell out of this
town and make something of herself,

763
00:35:04,024 --> 00:35:05,164
it's you.

764
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:07,730
Maybe I was just...

765
00:35:08,535 --> 00:35:11,704
getting all my crazy, bad
decisions out of the way early.

766
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:14,025
I see you somewhere
warm and glamorous,

767
00:35:14,092 --> 00:35:18,045
like L.A. or Miami
or Toronto.

768
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,287
(both laugh quietly)

769
00:35:21,283 --> 00:35:22,713
Fine.

770
00:35:23,941 --> 00:35:25,670
But you have
to do something for me.

771
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:27,955
You're staying here.

772
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,791
You're gonna lie
with me and hold me.

773
00:35:32,111 --> 00:35:33,606
Okay.

774
00:35:34,512 --> 00:35:36,296
But no funny business.

775
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,421
Who are you angry at?

776
00:35:44,756 --> 00:35:47,475
You know, the whole
"anger sex" thing.

777
00:35:51,898 --> 00:35:53,547
I need to tell you something.

778
00:35:54,564 --> 00:35:56,648
But you have to promise
to keep it a secret.

779
00:36:01,189 --> 00:36:03,723
(Bell ringing)

780
00:36:03,775 --> 00:36:04,870
How bad was it?

781
00:36:04,965 --> 00:36:06,394
Dukakis bad.

782
00:36:07,362 --> 00:36:09,830
Third place with 16%
of the vote.

783
00:36:09,897 --> 00:36:12,916
What does that mean for... us?

784
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,036
Yeah, I have
the same question.

785
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:17,788
Now that
the election's over,

786
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:20,061
you two don't have to pretend
to be something you're not.

787
00:36:20,075 --> 00:36:21,705
- Now, Shannon...
- Cooter, have a seat

788
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,168
on that Pilates ball
right over there.

789
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:24,996
This is between me...

790
00:36:24,997 --> 00:36:26,965
and Brian Dennehy.

791
00:36:27,414 --> 00:36:29,498
I lost a lot in
the last 24 hours.

792
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:32,269
Lost an election,
lost my reputation,

793
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,655
I lost an enormous last-minute
bet I placed on myself

794
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:37,489
with a very shady
bookie from Vegas.

795
00:36:37,574 --> 00:36:39,994
Cooter Mankins is the
best thing to happen to me

796
00:36:40,078 --> 00:36:43,831
since a sophomore named Becky
Jackson waddled into my life,

797
00:36:44,172 --> 00:36:47,391
and I will be damned
if I lose him, too.

798
00:36:49,438 --> 00:36:51,472
Shannon, I like you heaps.

799
00:36:52,104 --> 00:36:56,303
But I'd be lying if I told you
I didn't like Sue here, too.

800
00:36:58,123 --> 00:36:59,596
I don't know
what to say.

801
00:36:59,647 --> 00:37:01,315
I've had the same problem.

802
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,420
I haven't known what
to say, either.

803
00:37:03,783 --> 00:37:05,635
But I feel like
I finally do.

804
00:37:06,411 --> 00:37:08,105
Cooter, I'm in love with you.

805
00:37:08,156 --> 00:37:10,741
And I'm sorry I haven't
told you till now,

806
00:37:10,808 --> 00:37:13,310
and I'm sorry I let
a tall, pretty blonde

807
00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:15,026
swoop in and snatch
you right away,

808
00:37:15,144 --> 00:37:16,401
but I'm telling you now,

809
00:37:16,433 --> 00:37:18,297
if I had to bench-press
a wildebeest

810
00:37:18,328 --> 00:37:20,150
just to prove to you
how much you mean to me,

811
00:37:20,201 --> 00:37:21,502
I would do it.

812
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:24,488
I would do anything
to win you back, Coot.

813
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:28,787
And I will not go down
without a fight.

814
00:37:31,662 --> 00:37:33,130
(bell ringing)

815
00:37:33,181 --> 00:37:34,331
WILL:
Okay, guys.

816
00:37:34,382 --> 00:37:35,799
Shelby and I just
wanted to say

817
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:37,267
that you've really
inspired us.

818
00:37:37,335 --> 00:37:38,552
SHELBY: When we face off
at Sectionals,

819
00:37:38,636 --> 00:37:39,803
it will be with
more empathy,

820
00:37:39,854 --> 00:37:42,145
and a deeper understanding
of each other.

821
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,307
- That's right.
- That's right!

822
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:47,478
(cheering)

823
00:37:47,529 --> 00:37:48,678
Where's Rachel?

824
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,039
She never
misses applause.

825
00:37:50,336 --> 00:37:52,232
She's dealing with stuff.

826
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:53,984
- Mr. Shue?
- Yeah.

827
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,955
As the son of Ohio's
recently-minted Congressman...

828
00:37:59,148 --> 00:38:01,733
(cheering)
Yeah, Burt!

829
00:38:01,756 --> 00:38:04,581
and to dispel any lingering
clouds of suspicion,

830
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:07,464
I would like to,
personally and publicly,

831
00:38:08,503 --> 00:38:11,176
congratulate President Brittany.

832
00:38:12,554 --> 00:38:15,255
The people have spoken,
and they want you, Brit.

833
00:38:15,847 --> 00:38:17,547
They want Pixy Stix.

834
00:38:18,709 --> 00:38:20,094
Rule wisely.

835
00:38:20,178 --> 00:38:21,762
Rule fabulously.

836
00:38:21,846 --> 00:38:23,263
That was the sweetest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

837
00:38:23,348 --> 00:38:24,714
Ooh!
Thank you, Kurt.

838
00:38:24,766 --> 00:38:27,050
You're still the most
unicorn of them all, so...

839
00:38:27,102 --> 00:38:28,885
Clap, clap, clap.

840
00:38:30,188 --> 00:38:32,239
Maybe I could put that
on my NYADA application.

841
00:38:32,323 --> 00:38:33,557
Don't give up hope, ever.

842
00:38:33,608 --> 00:38:34,775
We'll figure something out.

843
00:38:35,851 --> 00:38:37,191
Quinn, are you okay?

844
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,447
Santana, will you
bring us home?

845
00:38:40,532 --> 00:38:42,583
- That's right!
- Thanks, Mr. Shue.

846
00:38:45,268 --> 00:38:48,471
So I picked a song that gives me
strength and gets me through.

847
00:38:48,596 --> 00:38:50,292
Same way all of you do.

848
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:54,511
The struggle continues, but
at least I know I'm not alone.

849
00:38:55,188 --> 00:38:58,874

I just, um,
told Principal Figgins

00:41:35,957 --> 00:41:38,508
that I rigged the election
so that Kurt would win.

Kurt, please,
don't hate me.

You're totally
in the clear.

What did he say?

893
00:41:44,228 --> 00:41:46,249
He said
that he had no choice

894
00:41:46,301 --> 00:41:48,302
but to put it
on my permanent record,

895
00:41:48,386 --> 00:41:50,404
and that I'm suspended
for a week.

896
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:56,179
Also he said that I was banned
from competing at Sectionals.
