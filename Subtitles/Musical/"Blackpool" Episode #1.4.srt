1
00:00:02,455 --> 00:00:05,015
(CARLISLE) I've caught Ripley in a lie
and he knows it.

2
00:00:05,095 --> 00:00:07,165
We've got a son
knowing we're on to his dad.

3
00:00:07,255 --> 00:00:08,893
- Ripley's wife?
- What about her?

4
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:10,693
Have you worked out what she's hiding?

5
00:00:10,775 --> 00:00:14,051
(DANNY) This copper is trying to say
I had a fight with the bloke who died.

6
00:00:14,135 --> 00:00:16,729
- I don't know if I did or not.
- Which copper's saying this?

7
00:00:16,815 --> 00:00:20,808
So Mike Hooley's body was moved
from your flats to your arcade

8
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:22,453
by someone who had keys to both.

9
00:00:22,535 --> 00:00:25,288
Did you have anything to do
with beating Steve up?

10
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:28,447
No, I didn't. But I wish I bloody well had.

11
00:00:28,535 --> 00:00:31,447
He got out of it on cider
and lay down on the railway line.

12
00:00:31,535 --> 00:00:34,607
I'd know if he was the type
to try and kill himself.

13
00:00:34,895 --> 00:00:38,046
Why are you behaving like this?
You're my daughter, for God's sake.

14
00:00:38,135 --> 00:00:39,124
Not now, I'm not.

15
00:00:39,215 --> 00:00:44,243
I killed Mike Hooley. I sold him drugs,
I beat him up. I killed him.

16
00:00:53,335 --> 00:00:55,371
(WALK TALL BY VAL DOONICAN)

17
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:59,607
# Walk tall

18
00:00:59,775 --> 00:01:01,766
# Walk tall, walk straight

19
00:01:01,855 --> 00:01:04,927
# And look the world right in the eye

20
00:01:05,055 --> 00:01:07,933
# That's what my mama told me

21
00:01:08,015 --> 00:01:10,006
# When I was about knee high

22
00:01:10,095 --> 00:01:12,165
# She said son, be a proud man

23
00:01:12,255 --> 00:01:14,325
# And hold your head up high

24
00:01:14,415 --> 00:01:16,133
# Walk tall, walk straight

25
00:01:16,215 --> 00:01:19,412

# All through the years that I grew up

27
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,088
# Ma taught these things to me

28
00:01:25,975 --> 00:01:28,284
# But I was young and foolish then

29
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:30,252
# And much too blind to see

30
00:01:30,695 --> 00:01:34,370
# I ignored the things she said
as if I'd never heard

31
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:37,170
# Now I see and understand

32
00:01:37,255 --> 00:01:39,211
# The wisdom of her words

33
00:01:39,295 --> 00:01:41,286

00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:44,014

36
00:01:47,335 --> 00:01:49,610

# And look the world right in the eye

41
00:01:59,655 --> 00:02:01,452
# I started going places

42
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:05,210
# Where the youngsters shouldn't go

43
00:02:05,295 --> 00:02:07,570
# I got to know the kind of girls

44
00:02:07,655 --> 00:02:09,771
# It's better not to know

45
00:02:09,855 --> 00:02:12,085
# I fell in with a bad crowd

46
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:14,609
# And laughed and drank with them

47
00:02:14,695 --> 00:02:16,686
# Through the laughter Mama's words

48
00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:18,333
# Would echo now and then

00:02:18,695 --> 00:02:20,526
# Walk tall, walk straight

00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:23,413

00:02:35,135 --> 00:02:38,013
# And look the world right in the eye #

57
00:02:39,335 --> 00:02:41,929
You lying, two-faced bastard.
You are full of shit.

58
00:02:42,015 --> 00:02:44,813
You're poison. Poison.

59
00:02:47,055 --> 00:02:49,011
- Here you are, sir.
- Get out!

60
00:02:56,455 --> 00:03:00,414
So what was the idea, eh?
Screw me so you could screw my son?

61
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:03,612
I haven't screwed your son.

62
00:03:03,695 --> 00:03:06,493
His confession doesn't even tally
with the victim's injuries.

63
00:03:06,575 --> 00:03:08,452
Hardly worth screwing me at all,
then, eh?

64
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:16,448
When I came to see you,
it was part of the investigation.

65
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:21,807
But that stopped
from the moment we first talked.

66
00:03:21,895 --> 00:03:23,931
We lay in each other's arms
in that hotel room

67
00:03:24,015 --> 00:03:27,849
and you asked me about my family,
about my son.

68
00:03:27,935 --> 00:03:30,733
Because I was curious about your life,
like any lover would be.

69
00:03:30,815 --> 00:03:32,771
No, you are not my lover.

70
00:03:33,535 --> 00:03:36,254
You are just some seedy copper
who fancied me.

71
00:03:37,895 --> 00:03:41,683
You were dead on when you said that
people always went for the same type

72
00:03:41,775 --> 00:03:44,130
because Ripley is a lying bastard, too.

73
00:03:44,295 --> 00:03:47,924
I didn't want it to end. What else
could I do? I had to lie about who I was.

74
00:03:48,015 --> 00:03:52,167
So, you were lying before you fell for me
and you were lying after?

75
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:56,611
Was there ever a time you weren't lying?

76
00:03:58,615 --> 00:03:59,764
Wait!

77
00:03:59,975 --> 00:04:01,328
Oh, I see.

78
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,935
You'd even use my wife to get at me,
wouldn't you?

79
00:04:07,255 --> 00:04:09,246
You're out of order, D.I. Carlisle.

80
00:04:09,335 --> 00:04:12,407
I was just assuring Mrs Holden
that Danny isn't in trouble.

81
00:04:12,895 --> 00:04:15,648
Well, perhaps not as much trouble
as he wanted to be.

82
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:17,691
Why don't you pick on somebody
your own size?

83
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:19,254
Danny came to me.

84
00:04:19,335 --> 00:04:21,849
If I'd wanted to arrest him,
I could have done it last week

85
00:04:21,935 --> 00:04:25,484
when I picked him up for supplying
speed. The boy is clearly very confused.

86
00:04:25,575 --> 00:04:28,533
- Well, he's not the only one, is he?
- Danny's doing drugs?

87
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:30,606
Come on, love. Let's get our son home.

88
00:04:32,415 --> 00:04:34,451
You just leave my family alone.

89
00:04:42,575 --> 00:04:44,645
I'm sorry,
but am I being the thick one here?

90
00:04:44,735 --> 00:04:47,613
How's confessing to a murder
you didn't do helping, exactly?

91
00:04:47,695 --> 00:04:51,051
- I think they're coming after you.
- Who's coming after me? The posse?

92
00:04:51,135 --> 00:04:54,491
- Indian tracker and a bounty hunter?
- They think you killed Mike Hooley.

93
00:04:54,575 --> 00:04:57,373
That Carlisle bloke,
did he actually say that?

94
00:04:57,455 --> 00:04:58,649
Not exactly.

95
00:04:58,735 --> 00:05:01,044
A minor dope charge for a minor dope.

96
00:05:06,255 --> 00:05:08,723
He did it because he was trying
to protect his dad.

97
00:05:08,815 --> 00:05:10,089
What's so bad about that?

98
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:13,008
He's going around confessing to crimes
he didn't do and I didn't do.

99
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:14,084
He's a bloody liability.

100
00:05:14,175 --> 00:05:17,292
- That's your son you're talking about.
- He could have been charged.

101
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:20,572
- Carlisle wouldn't have charged him.
- Carlisle wouldn't, would he?

102
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:22,486
You know all about him, do you?

103
00:05:22,575 --> 00:05:24,930
- Who are you bullying now?
- I don't bully anybody.

104
00:05:25,015 --> 00:05:27,529
- Tell that to Steve.
- Did he tell you I beat him up?

105
00:05:27,615 --> 00:05:28,809
He doesn't have to.

106
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:31,568
- Did he tell you I beat him up?
- No.

107
00:05:32,215 --> 00:05:34,649
He doesn't have to, does he? Look at you.

108
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:36,566
Yeah. Look at me. Look at me.

109
00:05:36,655 --> 00:05:39,647
- Ripley, for God's sake!
- Look at me. What do you see here?

110
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:43,011
What's my name? Mr Pony and Stabling?

111
00:05:43,095 --> 00:05:44,323
Mr Ballet Lessons?

112
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:45,973
Bathroom suite in girlie pink.

113
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:48,523
Mr Rowing Machine
that you hang your clothes off?

114
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,051
Home cinema
with multi-channel playback.

115
00:05:51,135 --> 00:05:53,330
Mr Renault,
like that Froggie footballer drives?

116
00:05:53,415 --> 00:05:54,643
Is that my name?

117
00:05:54,735 --> 00:05:56,885
I didn't realise you were totting it all up.

118
00:05:57,015 --> 00:05:59,927
- I'll get Steve to pay you when I leave.
- Why you...

119
00:06:06,175 --> 00:06:08,814
Thank your lucky stars
that I'm a modern parent.

120
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,408
(SHYANNE SOBBING)

121
00:06:25,215 --> 00:06:29,003
You don't just walk in off the street
and confess unless you feel guilty.

122
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:31,895
Danny Holden's confession
must still mean something.

123
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,966
I don't think it means anything.

124
00:06:34,055 --> 00:06:36,489
So you think the Holden family
are innocent?

125
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:38,008
Nobody is innocent.

126
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,893
(BLYTHE) What does she want?

127
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:47,933
Go and see if you can win
that diver's watch on the grabber.

128
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:02,854
(CARLISLE) It's good to see you.

129
00:07:03,655 --> 00:07:05,532
- Is it?
- Yeah.

130
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:14,527
Two times in my life
I've been happy, really happy.

131
00:07:15,855 --> 00:07:17,811
Once in Glasgow.

132
00:07:19,135 --> 00:07:21,933
1989, at some festival in the park.

133
00:07:23,655 --> 00:07:24,974
A summer's evening.

134
00:07:26,135 --> 00:07:27,727
This singer came on...

135
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:32,332
sounded exactly like Aretha Franklin
with a Scottish accent.

136
00:07:34,135 --> 00:07:37,684
If Proust had drunk McEwans, he'd have
written about moments like that.

137
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:40,894
And the other time?

138
00:07:42,055 --> 00:07:43,807
The other night when we made love.

139
00:07:45,575 --> 00:07:48,009
Even though you knew
you were lying to me?

140
00:07:50,175 --> 00:07:52,086
Yeah, even then.

141
00:07:54,535 --> 00:07:55,809
What about you?

142
00:07:56,015 --> 00:07:57,653
I don't know. It was...

143
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,204
like when someone turns on the lights

144
00:08:01,295 --> 00:08:03,855
and you realise
you've been sat in the dark for hours.

145
00:08:03,935 --> 00:08:06,324
- That is exactly how I feel.
- Good.

146
00:08:07,975 --> 00:08:11,126
Then it might give you some idea
of what you're putting me through.

147
00:08:12,775 --> 00:08:13,924
It hurts.

148
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:17,132
You think I want to just smile
and put this down to experience?

149
00:08:17,215 --> 00:08:19,251
You knew everything.
I only had half the story

150
00:08:19,335 --> 00:08:21,326
so how will I ever know
if you were for real?

151
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:24,725
- Just give me a chance to make it right.
- I'm already making it right.

152
00:08:25,655 --> 00:08:26,974
With my family.

153
00:08:27,055 --> 00:08:30,172
You made me realise that's where
I should be looking for happiness.

154
00:08:30,255 --> 00:08:32,211
Not from some sneaky affair
in a hotel bedroom

155
00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:34,331
with a man who tells ten lies
before breakfast.

156
00:08:34,415 --> 00:08:36,406
So in a way, in the end,
you did do me a favour.

157
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:37,928
I need you.

158
00:08:38,975 --> 00:08:40,931
I need you and you need me.

159
00:08:43,175 --> 00:08:44,654
We'll get over it.

160
00:08:51,295 --> 00:08:52,648
I got you a doughnut.

161
00:08:54,455 --> 00:08:55,888
Pink icing.

162
00:08:56,615 --> 00:08:58,094
Hundreds and thousands.

163
00:09:02,615 --> 00:09:04,810
I want to check the CCTV footage.

164
00:09:05,015 --> 00:09:07,575
- I've written it all up.
- No. You're not listening.

165
00:09:07,655 --> 00:09:09,885
I want to check the CCTV footage.

166
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:14,929
I want to interview Mike Hooley's
fiancee, I want to re-interview his mates.

167
00:09:15,695 --> 00:09:17,925
I want to read
all the forensics reports again.

168
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,449
I want a search warrant
for Ripley Holden's house.

169
00:09:20,535 --> 00:09:23,208
I want to find the taxi driver
that took Ripley Holden home

170
00:09:23,295 --> 00:09:24,853
on the night of the arcade opening.

171
00:09:24,935 --> 00:09:26,368
Right. What's the...

172
00:09:26,455 --> 00:09:29,128
We're going to assess motive,
means and opportunity.

173
00:09:29,815 --> 00:09:31,692
And to use the American vernacular,

174
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:35,529
we are going to nail
Ripley Holden's sorry ass.

175
00:09:46,655 --> 00:09:48,532
(LISTENING TO REGGAE MUSIC)

176
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:06,613
There's nothing so bad
that ska can't make better.

177
00:10:06,695 --> 00:10:08,048
Absolutely.

178
00:10:08,135 --> 00:10:10,012
How are you feeling?

179
00:10:10,135 --> 00:10:12,569
- On the mend, I think.
- So what happened?

180
00:10:15,135 --> 00:10:16,693
The bastard jumped me from behind.

181
00:10:16,775 --> 00:10:19,243
You know I'd never do a thing like that,
don't you?

182
00:10:19,695 --> 00:10:22,812
- I think I do, yeah.
- That's right.

183
00:10:22,895 --> 00:10:25,614
Because I like a man to see my face
when I'm hitting him.

184
00:10:27,255 --> 00:10:29,485
It was the shock more than anything.

185
00:10:29,575 --> 00:10:31,770
It wasn't just a punch.
He hit me with something.

186
00:10:31,855 --> 00:10:33,413
Then he had me off balance.

187
00:10:33,495 --> 00:10:35,804
I think I got one clean right hook
to his mouth.

188
00:10:35,895 --> 00:10:38,125
Steve, do yourself a favour.

189
00:10:38,575 --> 00:10:40,770
Don't make out
like it was Ali and Frazier,

190
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,494
talk like a fighter when you're not.

191
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,930
You end up looking like a limp dick
in a condom.

192
00:10:46,095 --> 00:10:48,893
So, did he kick you or what?

193
00:10:50,255 --> 00:10:51,813
Why do you need to hear this?

194
00:10:51,895 --> 00:10:55,046
I need the details so I can go out
and find the loser that did it.

195
00:10:55,135 --> 00:10:56,887
Until I do, Shyanne's blaming me.

196
00:10:56,975 --> 00:10:59,728
For a moment there
I thought you were concerned about me.

197
00:11:00,575 --> 00:11:02,213
I am concerned about you.

198
00:11:03,895 --> 00:11:05,089
Look.

199
00:11:12,175 --> 00:11:13,688
What's this?

200
00:11:13,775 --> 00:11:16,243
- Compensation.
- What for? My injuries?

201
00:11:16,335 --> 00:11:19,293
There's enough there for you to go
and start up somewhere else.

202
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,524
Why would I do that?

203
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:24,568
It's what you do when you're giving up
the woman you love.

204
00:11:24,855 --> 00:11:26,652
I wasn't aware that I was.

205
00:11:29,535 --> 00:11:31,969
One day, Shyanne'll look at you

206
00:11:32,055 --> 00:11:36,173
and she'll see a dried up orange at
the bottom of a fruit bowl, so why wait?

207
00:11:36,895 --> 00:11:39,284
This way you come out ahead,
financial-wise.

208
00:11:40,935 --> 00:11:42,573
So you're trying to buy me off?

209
00:11:44,615 --> 00:11:47,448
Clearly you didn't get the message
last time we spoke.

210
00:11:47,575 --> 00:11:51,204
So I thought this would
make you more cooperative.

211
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:09,084
May I remind you that although
the corpse incident was unfortunate,

212
00:12:09,175 --> 00:12:13,453
we are a family entertainment centre
with years of respectable trade.

213
00:12:13,975 --> 00:12:15,966
We have always been ahead of our time.

214
00:12:16,055 --> 00:12:19,411
We were one of the first arcades
on the Fylde coast to have carpet down.

215
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,972
Go on. Keep going. You can do this.

216
00:12:23,735 --> 00:12:27,694
Our new casino hotel will have
wheelchair access to all machines

217
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,369
to allow the disabled
of all shapes and sizes

218
00:12:30,455 --> 00:12:33,572
to enjoy the full range of our facilities.
This is crap, isn't it?

219
00:12:33,655 --> 00:12:36,647
No, I just think
you've just got to relax more.

220
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,009
Just be yourself.

221
00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:41,531
It was being myself that lost the
planning permission in the first place.

222
00:12:42,215 --> 00:12:44,934
The Enterprise Committee
wouldn't be coming down to see you

223
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:47,734
if they weren't taking your appeal
seriously, would they?

224
00:12:48,775 --> 00:12:53,291
You've got to remember who you are
and what you've achieved.

225
00:12:54,295 --> 00:12:56,889
That's right. I'm Ripley Holden.

226
00:12:56,975 --> 00:12:59,887
I'm a showman. I can persuade anyone
if I put my mind to it.

227
00:12:59,975 --> 00:13:01,966
I could charm the bollocks off a donkey.

228
00:13:02,055 --> 00:13:03,647
And then sell them back to him.

229
00:13:08,415 --> 00:13:10,849
I should start breaking windows
more often.

230
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,728
To a fresh start.

231
00:13:15,855 --> 00:13:17,208
A fresh start.

232
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,843
Jim got that Lover's Guide video
from a car boot sale.

233
00:13:25,935 --> 00:13:27,926
I could borrow it if you like.

234
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,449
Yeah. Right, I'll look forward to that.

235
00:13:32,135 --> 00:13:33,966
You're going to be late. It's 11:30.

236
00:13:39,775 --> 00:13:41,686
Put the champagne on ice.

237
00:13:41,775 --> 00:13:45,529
I'll be back tonight with a song
in my heart and a 40-foot hard-on.

238
00:13:45,615 --> 00:13:47,765
Well, I'll look forward to the song.

239
00:13:55,575 --> 00:13:58,453
When you came in to talk to us last time,

240
00:13:59,535 --> 00:14:03,687
you seemed to suggest that Mike Hooley
was a bit of a lad.

241
00:14:04,455 --> 00:14:06,525
How do you mean? The prossie and that?

242
00:14:08,175 --> 00:14:09,494
Not just that.

243
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:17,405
Well, he's dead now, isn't he?
So... story over.

244
00:14:17,935 --> 00:14:20,495
- He liked a night out, didn't he?
- Who doesn't?

245
00:14:21,855 --> 00:14:24,767
Would he ever get into any sort
of trouble on his nights out?

246
00:14:25,815 --> 00:14:28,375
He could look after himself
but he didn't go looking.

247
00:14:28,455 --> 00:14:31,891
Did he like the arcades or was that
just something that he did here?

248
00:14:33,295 --> 00:14:34,853
No. He was keen on the slots.

249
00:14:35,695 --> 00:14:37,413
Always banging on about a system.

250
00:14:38,055 --> 00:14:40,808
- A system?
- Yeah, where he could win.

251
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,205
Man against machine.
He was big on all that.

252
00:14:45,055 --> 00:14:48,764
So it'd be fair to say that
he wasn't over-fond of arcade owners?

253
00:14:50,535 --> 00:14:51,968
I don't know about that.

254
00:14:52,535 --> 00:14:54,332
He just wanted to win a few bob.

255
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,645
Is that what you and him
were fighting about?

256
00:14:58,135 --> 00:14:59,853
Him causing trouble in the arcades?

257
00:15:00,575 --> 00:15:02,930
We were pissed. You know how it is.

258
00:15:05,255 --> 00:15:08,167
Was it about him causing trouble
with this man?

259
00:15:18,975 --> 00:15:21,535
- It was about his fiancee, Emma.
- What about her?

260
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,007
He used to beat her up.

261
00:15:27,575 --> 00:15:29,645
We all knew he did it

262
00:15:29,735 --> 00:15:32,454
but he'd just come up
with some crap excuse or other.

263
00:15:34,055 --> 00:15:35,932
So I just wanted to have a word.

264
00:15:36,015 --> 00:15:37,653
Sort him out before the wedding.

265
00:15:38,535 --> 00:15:40,207
That's what the ruck was about.

266
00:15:58,135 --> 00:16:01,047
Here, you got that business plan
we talked about?

267
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:03,689
I have. It's a tissue of lies
and bogus statistics.

268
00:16:03,815 --> 00:16:06,124
That's just the kind I like.

269
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,604
Just as long as they don't
look at it too closely.

270
00:16:08,775 --> 00:16:12,245
Isn't that what you said to that hooker
I laid on for you the other night?

271
00:16:13,575 --> 00:16:16,612
Have you seen your mother anywhere,
love? I need to speak to her.

272
00:16:16,695 --> 00:16:17,923
My mother?

273
00:16:18,015 --> 00:16:20,893
That's not you, is it, Ruth?
You scrub up nicely, don't you?

274
00:16:20,975 --> 00:16:23,614
I'd give you one myself
if I hadn't changed my ways.

275
00:16:24,495 --> 00:16:28,807
Barry, if any kids stray to the over-18
section, shoot to kill, all right?

276
00:16:29,135 --> 00:16:30,648
Not now, Barry.

277
00:16:30,735 --> 00:16:34,011
Look, just keep nodding
and look like you're enjoying your work.

278
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:38,847
Here, have this one on me, my friend.

279
00:16:41,095 --> 00:16:42,448
Hey, up.

280
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:45,527
I need to talk to you about this plan
to remortgage the arcade.

281
00:16:45,615 --> 00:16:47,685
- It's not looking great.
- It doesn't matter.

282
00:16:47,775 --> 00:16:50,243
We're going to win this appeal,
get the planning permission

283
00:16:50,335 --> 00:16:51,973
to put the casino hotel back on track.

284
00:16:52,055 --> 00:16:55,525
Confidence is commendable
but you got to realise that if we fail...

285
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:59,051
There is no such word today.

286
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,444
This is where we turn this thing around.

287
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:03,888
Look.

288
00:17:04,615 --> 00:17:05,730
Gentlemen.

289
00:17:05,815 --> 00:17:08,887
Welcome to our family
entertainment centre.

290
00:17:09,775 --> 00:17:11,049
This way.

291
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:20,684
And this is Ripley Holden's Casino Hotel.

292
00:17:23,815 --> 00:17:26,249
(I'M GONNA MAKE YOU LOVE ME BY
THE TEMPTATIONS AND THE SUPREMES)

# I'm gonna do all the things for you

They said no.

352
00:20:22,335 --> 00:20:23,688
It's like women, isn't it?

353
00:20:23,775 --> 00:20:26,573
They have to say no a couple of times
for appearances sake.

- Couldn't be better.

Believe me, I don't want to stay here
any longer than I have to.

I thought you were staying
in that swanky hotel on the front.

What've you got to complain about?

361
00:20:55,335 --> 00:20:57,405
It doesn't make Blackpool
any more palatable.

362
00:20:57,495 --> 00:21:00,453
Yeah, well, someone like you
would never understand Blackpool.

363
00:21:00,855 --> 00:21:02,811
Oh, where a schoolboy can sell you drugs

364
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:04,851
and you end up dead
if you overstep the mark?

- Says he didn't take you straight home.
- So?

370
00:21:22,135 --> 00:21:24,808
He says he dropped you outside here
at 3:45.

371
00:21:24,935 --> 00:21:28,371
I fancied standing outside my arcade
and admiring it.

372
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:31,288
Something you wouldn't understand.
Not being a businessman.

373
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,286
Is that when you saw Mike Hooley again?

374
00:21:33,535 --> 00:21:35,093
I'm not going to fall for that one.

More or less.

No, I go home around midnight.

but why were you going to marry Mike?

Why do you think?
Why does anybody marry someone?

00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:48,565
A question I ask myself on a daily basis.

392

Did you love him?

Yeah. I loved him.

What did you love about him?

395
00:22:55,175 --> 00:22:56,767
You know, he enjoyed life.

of an evening,

would he walk away or would he,
perhaps, stand his ground?

00:26:10,495 --> 00:26:12,326
You said you'd be pleased for me.

446
00:26:12,895 --> 00:26:14,931
You can't even do that, can you?

447
00:26:15,015 --> 00:26:17,131
You can't even pretend.

448
00:26:17,215 --> 00:26:21,413
Shyanne. Come on, love, don't be silly.
I was just surprised, that's all.

449
00:26:21,495 --> 00:26:24,487
- I thought you were on my side.
- I am on your side.

450
00:26:24,735 --> 00:26:27,533
- Marriage is a big step, isn't it?
- Who's getting married?

451
00:26:27,655 --> 00:26:29,611
- I am.
- Who to?

452
00:26:30,695 --> 00:26:32,686
- I got married when I was your age.
- So?

453
00:26:32,775 --> 00:26:35,653
I thought that was one of the things
that irritated you about me.

454
00:26:35,735 --> 00:26:38,374
- Married young, stayed at home.
- You're not that unhappy.

455
00:26:38,455 --> 00:26:40,127
You have no idea.

456
00:26:40,215 --> 00:26:42,365
You're just saying this
to spoil everything.

457
00:26:42,455 --> 00:26:45,606
- You're saying it because you're jealous.
- No, I am not jealous.

458
00:26:45,695 --> 00:26:48,209
I just don't want you to get carried away
and regret it.

459
00:26:48,295 --> 00:26:50,445
Just because your love life's
so far behind you,

460
00:26:50,535 --> 00:26:53,493
you can't remember what
it even feels like to get carried away.

461
00:26:53,575 --> 00:26:56,135
I know exactly what it feels like
to get carried away.

462
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:58,968
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.
- Yes, sure you are.

463
00:26:59,055 --> 00:27:02,092
Why do you think I ended up
having an affair? You tell me that.

464
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:04,644
What?

465
00:27:07,095 --> 00:27:09,086
You had an affair?

466
00:27:19,215 --> 00:27:20,534
It's over now.

467
00:27:22,815 --> 00:27:24,214
It was stupid.

468
00:27:27,175 --> 00:27:29,245
It was more in my head
than anything else.

469
00:27:31,975 --> 00:27:33,533
You can't have had an affair.

470
00:27:34,935 --> 00:27:36,209
You're my mum.

471
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:42,534
I was just trying to prove a point
to you. It's nothing to get upset about.

472
00:27:43,775 --> 00:27:44,810
But, Dad.

473
00:27:46,295 --> 00:27:47,808
What about Dad?

474
00:27:48,615 --> 00:27:49,730
Does he know?

475
00:27:49,815 --> 00:27:52,852
No, of course he doesn't know.
What good would telling him do?

476
00:27:53,095 --> 00:27:56,531
It's over and done with now.
Just forget I said anything about it.

477
00:27:57,015 --> 00:27:59,006
Forget that my mum had an affair?

478
00:28:00,415 --> 00:28:01,973
It was nothing.

479
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,285
But, enough for you
not to want Dad to know.

480
00:28:05,735 --> 00:28:08,374
Shyanne, you told me a secret
and I promised to keep it.

481
00:28:09,535 --> 00:28:11,412
I didn't promise you anything.

482
00:28:29,055 --> 00:28:31,364
- What?
- Nothing.

483
00:28:32,095 --> 00:28:34,848
- Have I got a bat in the cave or what?
- Nothing.

484
00:28:35,855 --> 00:28:37,971
I was just wondering

485
00:28:38,055 --> 00:28:40,888
how well you and Mum knew each other
when you got married.

486
00:28:40,975 --> 00:28:43,250
You know what I miss
since I became middle class?

487
00:28:43,335 --> 00:28:45,326
- Having the telly on when we're eating.
- Me, too.

488
00:28:45,415 --> 00:28:47,645
I deal with all the flossing
and side plates and shit.

489
00:28:47,735 --> 00:28:49,054
Did you know her that well?

490
00:28:49,135 --> 00:28:51,330
I knew her well enough
to want to marry her.

491
00:28:51,575 --> 00:28:53,884
If I'd known her any better,
clearly I wouldn't.

492
00:28:53,975 --> 00:28:57,331
And do you think that you got
to know her better over the years?

493
00:28:57,415 --> 00:29:00,168
- Of course. What sort of question's that?
- Of course he did.

494
00:29:00,255 --> 00:29:02,610
What are you? The Liverpool Echo?

495
00:29:02,695 --> 00:29:05,448
Just ease off, Shyanne,
and eat your food, will you?

496
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:09,289
I'm just interested in what's kept
your marriage going for so long.

497
00:29:09,735 --> 00:29:11,487
- That's all.
- Let's just drop it now.

498
00:29:13,575 --> 00:29:15,088
Do you want to say something?

499
00:29:17,295 --> 00:29:18,523
Ask Mum.

500
00:29:19,615 --> 00:29:22,527
- Any idea what she's going about?
- She's not worth it.

501
00:29:26,895 --> 00:29:28,726
I got engaged today.

502
00:29:30,415 --> 00:29:31,484
You did what?

503
00:29:32,255 --> 00:29:34,644
Steve and I got engaged to be married.

504
00:29:37,935 --> 00:29:39,812
- You are joking.
- No.

505
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:44,134
And you knew about this?

506
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:46,406
She told me this afternoon, yeah.

507
00:29:46,815 --> 00:29:48,373
What do you think of the ring?

508
00:29:49,055 --> 00:29:51,125
It's very shiny.

509
00:29:51,455 --> 00:29:52,968
I wanted him to take it back.

510
00:29:53,055 --> 00:29:54,807
I said he couldn't afford it.

511
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:58,447
But, well, he said he'd come into
some money, unexpectedly.

512
00:29:59,775 --> 00:30:00,969
Did he?

513
00:30:03,615 --> 00:30:06,368
Mike Hooley's fiancee's told us
that he used to hit her.

514
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:11,129
If he hit her, he wouldn't think twice
about hitting that prostitute Hailey.

515
00:30:11,215 --> 00:30:13,729
- How does that get us closer to Ripley?
- It doesn't.

516
00:30:13,975 --> 00:30:17,126
It might have been the prostitute.
It might have been Hooley's best man.

517
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:18,933
Last week it might have been
Danny Holden.

518
00:30:19,015 --> 00:30:20,971
I'm trying to keep
an open mind here, sir.

519
00:30:21,055 --> 00:30:23,011
On the one hand,
there's keeping an open mind,

520
00:30:23,095 --> 00:30:26,212
on the other, there's being a feather
for every wind that blows.

521
00:30:28,175 --> 00:30:30,609
I'll set up another interview
with that prostitute.

522
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:32,890
You do that, Blythe. You do that.

523
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:07,854
What do you want, Danny?

524
00:31:09,615 --> 00:31:10,843
Nothing.

525
00:31:14,095 --> 00:31:17,565
Do you think Shyanne's getting married
to Steve because he got beat up?

526
00:31:17,655 --> 00:31:18,644
Maybe.

527
00:31:19,695 --> 00:31:23,051
A bruise and a broken nose
will get you a long way with women.

528
00:31:23,135 --> 00:31:25,490
- So you think she is?
- Maybe.

529
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,006
Yeah, but Steve's a wanker.

530
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:30,290
Yeah, but at least he's not a drug dealer.

531
00:31:32,095 --> 00:31:35,246
Carlisle got that wrong.
I was just getting it for a friend.

532
00:31:35,335 --> 00:31:38,213
That's why you had to lie about
not seeing Mike Hooley in the club?

533
00:31:38,295 --> 00:31:40,092
You'd sold him some gear, hadn't you?

534
00:31:40,175 --> 00:31:43,850
That's why I'm lying through my teeth
now, trying to get us out of this mess.

535
00:31:45,135 --> 00:31:47,285
- So it's all my fault.
- Oh!

536
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:49,013
Finally he gets there.

537
00:31:50,415 --> 00:31:51,530
Come on.

538
00:31:52,975 --> 00:31:54,488
I want to show you something.

539
00:31:57,895 --> 00:32:00,693
Take a look around you.
Is this what you want for yourself?

540
00:32:01,415 --> 00:32:02,643
Is this your ambition?

541
00:32:02,735 --> 00:32:04,691
Listen, Dad,
I've got something to tell you.

542
00:32:04,775 --> 00:32:08,529
I was 16 years old.
I'd run away from home.

543
00:32:09,215 --> 00:32:11,012
No roof over my head. Hungry.

544
00:32:12,415 --> 00:32:15,725
I'd heard that perverts hung out
at one of the arcades.

545
00:32:15,815 --> 00:32:18,887
Pay for rent boys and that.
I'm not proud to tell you, Danny.

546
00:32:19,455 --> 00:32:20,683
But I went down there.

547
00:32:21,455 --> 00:32:24,492
I was playing on one of the machines...

548
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,850
and sure enough,
this old bender came over.

549
00:32:26,935 --> 00:32:29,403
I was about to go with him.
You know what happened?

550
00:32:29,495 --> 00:32:31,326
- No.
- I got three bars on a win line.

551
00:32:31,415 --> 00:32:34,373
Ten quid jackpot payout.
The old Bar X machine.

552
00:32:35,175 --> 00:32:37,848
That's when I knew, I'd found my calling.

553
00:32:39,015 --> 00:32:41,006
I saw what I could do.

554
00:32:43,055 --> 00:32:45,011
- Will you just listen...
- No more listening.

555
00:32:45,095 --> 00:32:47,563
It's always excuses with you.
You're bloody useless.

556
00:32:47,655 --> 00:32:49,646
You're that far away from being a loser.

557
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:52,647
Take a look around you.
This is where you're going to end up

558
00:32:52,735 --> 00:32:54,532
if you don't shake yourself.

559
00:32:54,615 --> 00:32:57,812
I want you to stay here
and think about that.

560
00:33:18,535 --> 00:33:22,244
All I heard from Natalie for 20 years was,
"Let the kids think for themselves".

561
00:33:22,335 --> 00:33:25,884
That's all good in theory, but what if
they're thinking something stupid?

562
00:33:25,975 --> 00:33:29,888
- Where are you going with the machines?
- They need emergency maintenance.

563
00:33:31,015 --> 00:33:33,006
Now he doesn't want to
play football anymore.

564
00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:35,211
No. He'd rather sell speed to idiot Mancs.

565
00:33:35,295 --> 00:33:38,685
She's chucking away a good education
by getting married to the living dead.

566
00:33:38,775 --> 00:33:39,924
That'll never last.

567
00:33:40,015 --> 00:33:43,212
When they're born, you think you'll
never love anything this much again.

568
00:33:43,295 --> 00:33:44,728
And you're dead right. You don't.

569
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,806
I think you're looking on the black side.

570
00:33:46,895 --> 00:33:50,205
Thanks for sharing that insight with us,
Trisha.

571
00:33:52,095 --> 00:33:56,088
Take the rest outside and make sure
that door looks like it's been burgled.

572
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:57,650
I'm only saying...

573
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:01,284
You're only saying shit. That's your
trouble. You're always only saying.

574
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:03,366
You've got a trap like a groupie's chuff.

575
00:34:03,455 --> 00:34:04,934
What are you talking about?

576
00:34:05,015 --> 00:34:07,609
Carlisle dropped by.
Said he'd spoken to a taxi driver.

577
00:34:07,695 --> 00:34:08,684
So?

578
00:34:08,775 --> 00:34:11,608
I'm thinking he's bound to get there
in the end. Then I thought,

579
00:34:11,695 --> 00:34:15,085
"How did he find out
I'd taken a taxi in the first place?"

580
00:34:15,175 --> 00:34:16,654
There are records and stuff.

581
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,206
- Maybe the driver came forward.
- No chance.

582
00:34:20,295 --> 00:34:23,367
Bloke drove like an asylum seeker.
Albanian speed limits.

583
00:34:23,455 --> 00:34:25,969
I don't think he wants to get too cosy
with the police.

584
00:34:26,055 --> 00:34:28,011
You think I told Carlisle about the taxi?

585
00:34:28,095 --> 00:34:29,733
Hang on, Jim.
You're not saying that, are you?

586
00:34:29,815 --> 00:34:34,286
No. I'm saying you told him about the
taxi, about the flats, about the hookers.

587
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:36,331
You told him about my lad.

588
00:34:36,415 --> 00:34:39,964
It's a miracle you're not on your phone
now, telling him about these machines.

589
00:34:40,055 --> 00:34:42,250
I don't believe this.
Why would I grass you up?

590
00:34:42,335 --> 00:34:44,166
Because wherever you are,
whoever you're with,

591
00:34:44,255 --> 00:34:45,893
you wanna make yourself look important.

592
00:34:45,975 --> 00:34:48,853
- And I wasn't falling for it anymore.
- Not like you, then.

593
00:34:48,935 --> 00:34:50,493
No. Because I am important.

594
00:34:50,575 --> 00:34:52,566
Hang on, lads.
This is getting out of hand.

595
00:34:52,655 --> 00:34:56,204
The times I've stood up for you when
your gaming licence was up for renewal.

596
00:34:56,295 --> 00:34:59,128
Don't get sentimental on me, Jim,
you'll have me filling up.

597
00:34:59,215 --> 00:35:02,127
Let's just put it down
to you being a prick.

598
00:35:05,175 --> 00:35:06,324
(DOOR SLAMS)

599
00:35:14,975 --> 00:35:17,967
- Are you all right?
- Not really.

600
00:35:18,135 --> 00:35:20,410
- What is it?
- Nothing.

601
00:35:22,455 --> 00:35:24,047
I've been in town with Dad.

602
00:35:25,255 --> 00:35:28,327
Then I walked home thinking about stuff
and that, you know...

603
00:35:33,295 --> 00:35:36,890
You know, when sometimes
there's like a gap in your head

604
00:35:36,975 --> 00:35:38,567
where the right word should be.

605
00:35:39,815 --> 00:35:43,330
Or you think of an idea in a dream
and you know it's a dream

606
00:35:43,415 --> 00:35:46,691
and you think, "If I remember that,
everything will be all right."

607
00:35:48,175 --> 00:35:50,450
But then you wake up
and the word's gone.

608
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:54,407
Do you know what I mean?

609
00:35:54,495 --> 00:35:58,010
Danny, love, I just want to be left alone
for a bit. Is that all right?

610
00:35:59,015 --> 00:36:01,165
Sure. Yeah.

611
00:36:01,935 --> 00:36:03,050
Ta.

612
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:08,572
You think, "If I can't rely on my family,
at least I've got my mates."

613
00:36:08,655 --> 00:36:10,850
Then you find
you can't even depend on them.

614
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:12,687
I don't think that's true about Jim.

615
00:36:12,775 --> 00:36:15,414
All I was going through,
and that creosoted bastard

616
00:36:15,495 --> 00:36:18,248
was listening to me suffer and he knew.
He knew all along.

617
00:36:18,535 --> 00:36:20,048
You're being too hard on him.

618
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:26,485
You know this forgiving thing
you do, Terry.

619
00:36:26,575 --> 00:36:29,851
Forgiving your wife, forgiving me,
forgiving Allbright?

620
00:36:30,335 --> 00:36:33,691
I'm sure it's all very admirable
but it doesn't half get on my tit.

621
00:36:35,175 --> 00:36:36,767
We all do bad things, don't we?

622
00:36:37,455 --> 00:36:40,015
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What about that slap?

623
00:36:40,175 --> 00:36:41,369
What slap?

624
00:36:41,455 --> 00:36:44,652
- See. You've forgotten about it already.
- Me and you? The other day?

625
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,726
Come on, that was nothing.

626
00:36:46,855 --> 00:36:49,130
Exactly. I've been thinking about that.

627
00:36:49,855 --> 00:36:52,892
You don't slap another bloke.
Not if you respect him, you don't.

628
00:36:53,055 --> 00:36:54,488
You punch him.

629
00:36:54,655 --> 00:36:58,614
You slapped me like I was a little kid
or a girl or something.

630
00:36:58,735 --> 00:37:01,408
So what, you'd have preferred it
if I'd given you a good kicking?

631
00:37:01,495 --> 00:37:03,406
At least I'd have felt valued.

632
00:37:03,495 --> 00:37:07,408
Maybe I will give you a good kicking,
make you feel better about yourself.

633
00:37:08,215 --> 00:37:09,489
Maybe you will.

634
00:37:21,655 --> 00:37:24,533
Come here, come on.

635
00:37:25,895 --> 00:37:27,567
Shyanne will come to her senses.

636
00:37:27,775 --> 00:37:30,050
It's like you said, you know,
she's digging her heels in

637
00:37:30,135 --> 00:37:32,888
because she thinks I've got something
to do with beating him up.

638
00:37:32,975 --> 00:37:34,169
So?

639
00:37:34,255 --> 00:37:37,053
So, I'll find out who did it
and then it'll be all right.

640
00:37:37,815 --> 00:37:39,373
He must love her a lot.

641
00:37:39,935 --> 00:37:42,051
He's bought her a ring
and that means nothing.

642
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:44,171
Did you see the diamonds in it?

643
00:37:44,255 --> 00:37:46,450
It must have cost him a bit.
He can't afford that.

644
00:37:46,535 --> 00:37:49,891
- He's trying to buy her. That never works.
- That's good coming from you.

645
00:37:52,615 --> 00:37:54,526
How come this is about me
all of a sudden?

646
00:37:54,615 --> 00:37:59,325
- All right. No need to get so defensive.
- I'm trying to comfort you here.

647
00:37:59,415 --> 00:38:01,406
You say that
like you're doing me a favour.

648
00:38:01,495 --> 00:38:05,010
Believe it or not, it's what most normal
husbands do as a matter of course.

649
00:38:05,095 --> 00:38:07,734
You know, I'm not surprised
she's marrying that prick.

650
00:38:07,855 --> 00:38:10,608
I think she looks at us
and thinks she can't do any worse.

# Poor young grandson

# There's nothing I can say

00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:25,207
# You'll have to learn just like me

682
00:40:25,535 --> 00:40:27,969

# When I was stronger #

689
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:18,414
We could bring forensics here to check
this room with a fine-tooth comb.

690
00:41:19,495 --> 00:41:22,612
My bet is they could find evidence
that Mike Hooley was in here.

691
00:41:22,695 --> 00:41:25,050
That doesn't prove anything.
He could have wandered in

692
00:41:25,135 --> 00:41:26,773
when I went to drum up some business.

693
00:41:26,855 --> 00:41:28,732
- At 4:00 in the morning?
- My peak time.

694
00:41:29,215 --> 00:41:32,366
So he died,
was moved to the bedsit opposite

695
00:41:32,455 --> 00:41:34,889
and the following night
he was moved to the arcade

696
00:41:34,975 --> 00:41:39,014
and you expect us to believe
that you didn't see or hear anything?

697
00:41:41,215 --> 00:41:44,173
- We know he liked to beat up women.
- He wouldn't be the first.

698
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,691
If you're lying,
you're perverting the course of justice.

699
00:41:49,055 --> 00:41:52,843
And if there's any doubt that
he was still alive when you moved him,

700
00:41:52,935 --> 00:41:55,449
- it could be manslaughter.
- I didn't kill him.

701
00:41:55,535 --> 00:41:59,164
No, I don't think you did. But I think
you moved the body, didn't you?

702
00:42:00,735 --> 00:42:04,569
I panicked. All right?
He collapsed and I panicked.

703
00:42:04,975 --> 00:42:08,251
And was this before or after
you supplied him with drugs?

704
00:42:08,335 --> 00:42:09,324
(WHISTLES)

705
00:42:10,335 --> 00:42:13,213
I sniffed a couple of poppers
and I turned to get ready.

706
00:42:14,295 --> 00:42:16,172
I heard him fall and he was dead.

707
00:42:17,175 --> 00:42:18,733
I didn't know what to do

708
00:42:18,815 --> 00:42:21,613
so I dragged him to an empty bedsit
over the hall.

709
00:42:21,695 --> 00:42:23,447
You dragged him there by yourself?

710
00:42:23,535 --> 00:42:26,891
I used to be a dominatrix
in Burton-on-Trent. You never lose it.

711
00:42:27,015 --> 00:42:30,530
- So why move him again to the arcade?
- It was the only place I had keys to.

712
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:33,768
I thought maybe it'd look
more like an accident in there.

713
00:42:34,455 --> 00:42:36,844
You had keys to Ripley Holden's arcade?

714
00:42:38,015 --> 00:42:40,165
He keeps a spare set here
for emergencies.

715
00:42:40,695 --> 00:42:42,208
The alarm code's on the fob.

716
00:42:42,455 --> 00:42:46,334
- He trusts you with a spare set of keys?
- He trusts me with a lot of things.

717
00:42:48,575 --> 00:42:52,693
Why is any man dropped off in town
at 3:45 in the morning?

718
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,852
He's searching for a shag.

719
00:42:54,935 --> 00:42:58,007
Ripley drops in on Hailey
but who's turned up at the same time?

720
00:42:58,095 --> 00:43:00,848
Mike Hooley. That bastard
who's been annoying him all night.

721
00:43:00,935 --> 00:43:02,846
It's a bit of a coincidence, isn't it?

722
00:43:02,935 --> 00:43:07,565
Well, how about he put the word out
that he wanted to nail Mike Hooley

723
00:43:07,655 --> 00:43:09,054
for scamming his arcade

724
00:43:09,135 --> 00:43:10,932
and Hailey rang him when he turned up?

725
00:43:11,015 --> 00:43:13,848
So why didn't he move the body
to the arcade on the same night?

726
00:43:13,935 --> 00:43:15,163
Because it was too late.

727
00:43:15,255 --> 00:43:18,327
Because Hallworth begins his one-man
protest at 5:00 in the morning.

728
00:43:18,415 --> 00:43:20,292
No. Hailey was scared out of her wits.

729
00:43:20,415 --> 00:43:22,531
Why? Because she killed Mike Hooley.

730
00:43:22,735 --> 00:43:26,444
He's gone there, started on her, she's hit
him with a weapon in self-defence.

731
00:43:26,815 --> 00:43:29,613
She's scared all right.
She's scared of Ripley Holden.

732
00:43:46,015 --> 00:43:48,085
I'm sorry about being so mean to you.

733
00:43:48,575 --> 00:43:50,531
About, you know...

734
00:43:50,695 --> 00:43:53,334
- I'm sorry I told you.
- No. I'm glad you did.

735
00:43:53,895 --> 00:43:54,964
Right.

736
00:43:55,815 --> 00:43:58,613
- You're not going to leave Dad, are you?
- No, love.

737
00:43:58,815 --> 00:44:00,134
And it is over?

738
00:44:00,775 --> 00:44:01,844
Yes.

739
00:44:02,855 --> 00:44:06,484
It's me and Danny who make you
unhappy and we'll be leaving home soon.

740
00:44:07,335 --> 00:44:08,893
No, it isn't.

741
00:44:10,335 --> 00:44:12,371
It's not your fault. Really it's not.

742
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:21,811
You know all the times
you tried to talk to me...

743
00:44:21,895 --> 00:44:24,170
and ask me about my feelings
and all that.

744
00:44:25,615 --> 00:44:28,573
I ignored you and was sarcastic and stuff.

745
00:44:30,455 --> 00:44:33,367
It was like I knew I was doing it,
but I couldn't stop.

746
00:44:34,575 --> 00:44:36,452
And then it was just something I did.

747
00:44:38,775 --> 00:44:40,174
It didn't mean I hated you.

748
00:44:43,975 --> 00:44:45,249
I know, love.

750
00:44:56,775 --> 00:44:58,333
It's that copper.

751
00:45:04,135 --> 00:45:05,568
Is your husband in?

752
00:45:06,415 --> 00:45:08,087
No. He's at the arcade.

753
00:45:08,775 --> 00:45:10,766
He's had another break-in.

754
00:45:10,855 --> 00:45:13,323
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

755
00:45:13,415 --> 00:45:17,010
Yeah, well, there's a big market
for second-hand gaming machines.

757
00:45:19,415 --> 00:45:21,292
Still, it's unlucky.

758
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:22,854
What with the other break-in.

759
00:45:22,935 --> 00:45:25,768
Hm. He's going through
an unlucky phase.

760
00:45:27,135 --> 00:45:28,250
We all are.

761
00:45:30,095 --> 00:45:32,086
Amen to that.

762
00:45:33,495 --> 00:45:36,055
So, shall I get him to give you a call?

763
00:45:36,135 --> 00:45:39,684
Yeah, if you could tell him
I'd like to talk to him.

764
00:45:40,215 --> 00:45:41,933
Yeah. Sure. Okay. I could do that.

765
00:45:45,575 --> 00:45:48,009
Is there anything else?
Because I was going out.

766
00:45:48,095 --> 00:45:49,528
- That's it.
- Okay.

767
00:45:51,055 --> 00:45:52,283
Take care.

768
00:46:55,415 --> 00:46:58,566
It's not just the money, Ruth,
it's the psychological damage.

and into my bowels.

a 360 degree ceiling unit installed

771
00:47:06,655 --> 00:47:09,044
and let's apply to the police
for instant bells.

772
00:47:09,135 --> 00:47:12,491
Nobody touch anything here until
the insurance assessors have got here.

00:47:12,575 --> 00:47:14,964
Now come on, chop, chop.
Got to keep moving forward.

The thing is my investment, my ?2,000.

Me and Barry were noticing that, maybe,

776
00:47:23,175 --> 00:47:25,006
if you're doing insurance fiddles,

777
00:47:25,095 --> 00:47:28,087
it might be a good time
to get our money out.

778

Now? It's the best time to buy.
It's called a bear market.

to be honest.

might give me a better return.

781
00:47:41,855 --> 00:47:44,210
Did he just say that or
are you throwing your voice?

782
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:46,809
It's just, well, it's all I've got.

783
00:47:46,895 --> 00:47:51,923
And if the casino hotel doesn't get built,

to an endoscopy this winter.

00:48:02,215 --> 00:48:05,127
My oldest, trusted business partners
want out.

Well, not out, exactly. Just less in.

What return did he get
on his investment, eh?

793
00:48:21,975 --> 00:48:24,284
He was cast out into the outer darkness

794
00:48:24,375 --> 00:48:26,969
where there will be a weeping
and a gnashing of teeth.

Remortgage my house? Shangri-La?

798
00:48:49,695 --> 00:48:52,732
No way. No bloody way!
I'm not risking that.

799
00:48:52,815 --> 00:48:54,931

the arcade?

Well, go out and find some new investors
to tide us over.

With respect, Ripley, if Ruth and Deaf
Barry are starting to have doubts...

804
00:49:07,415 --> 00:49:11,044
And it won't be long before your big
investors want their money out, too.

805
00:49:11,135 --> 00:49:14,923
- I'll get planning permission in 6 weeks.
- Nobody believes that except you.

806
00:49:15,015 --> 00:49:16,892
Well, I've been here before.

Do you think that scares me?

808
00:49:19,895 --> 00:49:21,248
No, it gives me a hard-on.

809
00:49:23,495 --> 00:49:26,931
At least let me look into

or you can just walk out of here, sacked.

Come on, Ripley.
No need to take that sort of tone.

Go on. Go out there and look again.

- Because it's what you did.

I didn't mean that.

845
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:59,649
I just said that to shake you up a bit.

846
00:54:00,255 --> 00:54:02,007
But topping yourself...

847
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:07,005
Wasn't there anyone you could talk to?
Come on. A mate? Anybody?

848
00:54:07,135 --> 00:54:08,966
I rang the Samaritans.

849
00:54:09,055 --> 00:54:11,364
They clearly did a first-class job,
didn't they?

850
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:14,049
Mum answered. I recognised her voice.

851
00:54:15,095 --> 00:54:16,653
(RIPLEY SIGHS)

852
00:54:20,575 --> 00:54:22,133
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

853
00:54:23,415 --> 00:54:24,973
Of all the luck, eh?

854
00:54:29,775 --> 00:54:32,050
Come on. Let's get you home.

855
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:43,090
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

856
00:54:45,495 --> 00:54:46,974
I beat up Steve.

857
00:54:48,255 --> 00:54:51,088
Don't you think I guessed that already?
I knew it had to be you.

858
00:54:51,175 --> 00:54:53,405
I was only trying to help.
Then you got the blame.

859
00:54:53,495 --> 00:54:54,564
It doesn't matter.

860
00:54:54,655 --> 00:54:57,852
There's nothing you do that's so bad
that we can't sort it out. Nothing.

861
00:54:57,935 --> 00:54:59,163
I moved the body, Dad.

862
00:55:00,375 --> 00:55:01,774
You what?

863
00:55:01,855 --> 00:55:04,369
I moved Mike Hooley
from your flats to the arcade.

864
00:55:05,055 --> 00:55:07,523
- You did?
- Hailey rang me on my mobile.

865
00:55:07,695 --> 00:55:09,048
How do you know Hailey?

866
00:55:09,135 --> 00:55:11,808
She was panicking
because he'd collapsed at her flat.

867
00:55:11,895 --> 00:55:15,490
He looked dead and she knew you'd get
in the shit if he was found there.

868
00:55:15,575 --> 00:55:17,805
So you thought you'd move him
to the arcade?

869
00:55:17,895 --> 00:55:22,173
For safe keeping. I was going to move
him early next morning.

870
00:55:23,375 --> 00:55:25,172
And that copper knows, Dad.

871
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:27,246
He looks at me and he knows.

872
00:55:27,855 --> 00:55:31,370
And he's going to get the forensics
and say I murdered him when I didn't.

873
00:55:31,455 --> 00:55:32,649
No, he's not.

874
00:55:33,895 --> 00:55:36,773
I just couldn't see a way out. I'm useless.

875
00:55:38,575 --> 00:55:40,964
You know, when I lay down
on those railway tracks?

876
00:55:41,655 --> 00:55:45,284
I look back now and I think,
"What was that all about?"

877
00:55:47,055 --> 00:55:48,966
I would have missed so much.

878
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:51,973
You know, it's like walking out
before the end of a film.

879
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:54,133
What if you don't like the film?

880
00:55:54,215 --> 00:55:56,570
At least hang around to see
how it turns out.

881
00:55:56,655 --> 00:55:58,452
Odds are it's gonna get better.

882
00:55:58,535 --> 00:56:02,608
Unless Hugh Grant's in it, in which case
you might be better off topping yourself.

883
00:56:03,055 --> 00:56:04,647
Don't you know how much...

884
00:56:04,935 --> 00:56:06,254
What I'm saying is...

885
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:10,290
it'd tear me apart
if you came to any harm.

886
00:56:11,375 --> 00:56:14,253
- It'd kill me, too. Do you understand me?
- Yeah.

887
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:16,291
Any problem,

888
00:56:16,375 --> 00:56:20,573
any time things are getting too much
for you, you come to me. Understood?

889
00:56:20,655 --> 00:56:23,453
This body business, that Carlisle,

890
00:56:23,535 --> 00:56:25,491
I'll find a way out for you.

891
00:56:25,575 --> 00:56:27,884
- Don't you worry about it any longer.
- How?

892
00:56:28,335 --> 00:56:30,803
I'll sort it, Danny. I promise you.

893
00:56:33,055 --> 00:56:34,647
(BANGING ON DOOR)

894
00:56:50,295 --> 00:56:52,525
I've just dragged my lad
off the railway tracks.

895
00:56:52,615 --> 00:56:55,766
He was trying to top himself because
of what you're putting him through.

896
00:56:55,855 --> 00:56:59,609
- Danny?
- Yes, Danny. My lad.

897
00:56:59,695 --> 00:57:02,846
Scared out of his wits 'cause he thinks
you're going to arrest him.

898
00:57:03,015 --> 00:57:06,485
- I'm sorry he's taking it so badly.
- What will it take, Carlisle?

899
00:57:06,575 --> 00:57:09,214
What will it take for you to stop
hounding the lad?

900
00:57:09,295 --> 00:57:10,887
I'm doing my job.

901
00:57:10,975 --> 00:57:13,364
You know bloody well Danny didn't do it.

902
00:57:14,135 --> 00:57:16,808
Maybe he didn't.
But in the absence of any better suspect

903
00:57:16,895 --> 00:57:19,489
I'm duty bound to carry on
building a case against him.

904
00:57:21,575 --> 00:57:23,691
If you've got to pick on someone,
pick on me.

905
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,848
Is that you telling me
I have reason to suspect you?

906
00:57:27,935 --> 00:57:30,813
- Lf you like. Yeah. Why not?
- So what are you admitting to?

907
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,530
What?

908
00:57:33,615 --> 00:57:35,845
I can't just suspect you
because you've told me to.

909
00:57:35,935 --> 00:57:37,812
What exactly are you admitting to?

910
00:57:46,215 --> 00:57:49,571
I moved Mike Hooley's body
to the arcade.

911
00:57:51,335 --> 00:57:52,768
There. You happy now?

912
00:57:53,735 --> 00:57:55,805
- You moved the body?
- Correct.

913
00:57:55,895 --> 00:57:57,010
Why?

914
00:57:57,095 --> 00:58:00,292
I didn't want the planning people
thinking that my future casino hotel

915
00:58:00,375 --> 00:58:02,206
was being used as a part-time brothel.

916
00:58:02,295 --> 00:58:05,810
Let's get you down to the station,
get your statement and get you charged.

917
00:58:07,655 --> 00:58:09,327
What, you're making this official?

918
00:58:09,815 --> 00:58:12,124
I thought this was off the record,
you know, man to man.

919
00:58:13,495 --> 00:58:16,567
You've just come here
and confessed to a very serious crime.

920
00:58:18,135 --> 00:58:20,524
Now, why would I want to keep that
off the record?
