- Plenty of room for everybody, sir.
- Oh!

23
00:01:26,694 --> 00:01:29,390
Now, don't try this at home.

00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,297
Part of the show.
Totally planned.

25
00:01:32,367 --> 00:01:36,326
Stay with me now, folks,
'cause here comes the good stuff.

00:01:36,404 --> 00:01:39,601
# Once in Mongolia
I noticed a fire #

#Whole city burnin'
and the flames gettin' higher #

00:01:43,044 --> 00:01:46,480

34
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:10,263
Folks, that's 10,000 pounds of pressure.

35
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:15,776
Go over there at once and put a stop
to that inane little bat.

36
00:02:15,843 --> 00:02:17,936
No, Ludmilla.
Leave him alone.

37
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,946
I like him.
He's funny.

38
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,539
- Your Highness, can you...
- Yes?

39
00:02:24,052 --> 00:02:26,020
As you wish.

40
00:02:26,087 --> 00:02:28,453
Leave him be.

41
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,117
Folks, this here's a dragon,
an exact replica.

00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,353
150, 200 tons easy.

43
00:02:33,428 --> 00:02:36,363
A fire spitter.
Kill you with a flick of the tail.

44
00:02:36,431 --> 00:02:39,025
Careful there, sir.
Better safe than sorry.

00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,127
# One time in Hungary
this dragon appears #

46
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:46,537
# He's very "hungary"
No dinner in years #

47
00:02:46,607 --> 00:02:49,872
#And then he grabs me
and I'm practically through #

48
00:02:49,944 --> 00:02:52,208
But I summon all my strength...

49
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,681
and using the dragon's body weight
against him, I throw him off me.

50
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:00,380
And I give him a one to the solar plexus
and a two to the kidneys.

51
00:03:00,455 --> 00:03:03,549
# He was deflated
'cause I knew my kung fu #

And here's a sailor's breastplate,

79
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,927

"ropin' the bear."

Prince Ivan, that...
that is a ring for a Romanoff.

- No commoner may ever wear that.
- Why?

90
00:05:47,421 --> 00:05:49,651
Because...
[Laughing]

91
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,522
Because that is
how it has always been.

92
00:05:52,593 --> 00:05:56,085
Well, perhaps it's time for a change.

It was the least I could do.

- [Ivan] Bye!
- Wow. Would you look
at the shine on that?

98

especially street performers.

101
00:06:27,995 --> 00:06:31,453
- You only encourage them.
- Well, I wanted to encourage him.

102
00:06:31,532 --> 00:06:35,491
Ludmilla, don't be that way.

103
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:39,097
The people like the bat.
Did you see how he made them smile?

104
00:06:39,173 --> 00:06:41,835
- It was nice to see them happy.
- Nonsense.

105
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:44,605
I thought he was funny.

106
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:48,843
- Vol, what do you think?
- I thought so.

107
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,180
When the feathers cleared...

108
00:06:51,252 --> 00:06:55,245
and the bat's standing there
holding a chicken...

109
00:06:57,158 --> 00:06:59,149
- That's good stuff.
- See?

110
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:02,593
Or... [Laughs]
When he punched the...

111
00:07:02,663 --> 00:07:06,997
Silence.
Yes, Your Highness, I know.

112
00:07:07,068 --> 00:07:09,002
But one day you'll be czar.

113
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,164
You must show respect
for your crown.

114
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:16,437
If you don't,
how can you expect the peasants to?

115
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,241
Your Highness,
are you listening to me?

116
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:23,442
I'm tired of listening to you,
Ludmilla.

117
00:07:23,517 --> 00:07:27,544
If I am the future czar,
then I will do as I choose.

118
00:07:27,622 --> 00:07:30,955
And it is you
who must respect the crown.

00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,627

One for me and one for me.

122
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:49,121
One, two, three for me.

123
00:07:49,192 --> 00:07:52,161
One, two, three...

124
00:07:52,228 --> 00:07:54,162
for me.

[Growling]

126
00:07:56,533 --> 00:07:59,730
And one, two, three, four for me.

127

- And... Aah!
- [Roars]

128
00:08:05,608 --> 00:08:08,202
Why do you do that?
I hate when you do that.

129
00:08:08,278 --> 00:08:13,375
[Laughing]
Ah, that never fails to amuse me.

130
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,384
- Ha ha ha.
- Oh, come now.

131
00:08:15,452 --> 00:08:18,683
You're certainly not going to let
the fact that I got the better of you...

132
00:08:18,755 --> 00:08:24,284
ruin quite possibly one of
our finer performances to date, hmm?

133
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,227
You were inspiring today:

134
00:08:27,297 --> 00:08:30,733
Focused, fully in the moment,

135
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,930
exceeding well beyond
what your talent would indicate.

136
00:08:35,004 --> 00:08:38,098
- Thanks a lot.
- And l...

137
00:08:38,174 --> 00:08:42,304
Well, suffice it to say
the performance of my death today...

138
00:08:42,378 --> 00:08:45,074
would have shamed Prometheus.

139
00:08:45,148 --> 00:08:47,378
Bound to a cliff...

140
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,386
Okay, okay. Okay, Zozi,
with the cliff and the thing. Sheesh!

141
00:08:51,454 --> 00:08:54,787
I wish you could hear yourself.
It's really quite irritating.

142
00:08:54,858 --> 00:08:59,795
Critics.
And what, pray tell, are you doing now?

143
00:08:59,863 --> 00:09:02,229
I'm divvying up the spoils.
What do you mean?

144
00:09:02,298 --> 00:09:06,462
This again.
Why not just pool our assets?
We're always together as it is.

145
00:09:06,536 --> 00:09:08,470
No, no, no.
Fair is fair.

146
00:09:08,538 --> 00:09:10,733
You're not planning on keeping that,
are you?

147
00:09:10,807 --> 00:09:13,401
What are you talking about?
He gave it to me.

148
00:09:13,476 --> 00:09:15,410
Yes, but he's a child.

149
00:09:15,478 --> 00:09:18,072
It is a ring for royalty,
and you should know better.

150
00:09:18,148 --> 00:09:20,241
Yeah, well, maybe I don't.

151
00:09:20,316 --> 00:09:22,910
Well, I can only hope
one day you will.

152
00:09:22,986 --> 00:09:27,150
There we go.
Perfectly balanced,
my friend. Here.

153
00:09:27,223 --> 00:09:29,384
- Perfectly balanced?
- Oh, yeah.

154
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:32,326
- Both sides are the same?
- Exactly even.

155
00:09:32,395 --> 00:09:35,922
Good. Then you won't mind
if I take this side.

156
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,593
Whoa, whoa.
Wait a second there, fella.

157
00:09:38,668 --> 00:09:41,933
What happened
to pooling our assets?

158
00:09:42,005 --> 00:09:45,998
- Will you give
the prince back his ring?
- Well, what's the hurry?

159
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:50,011
He's not going anywhere.
Sheesh!

Oh.
Oh, this can't be.

165
00:10:37,727 --> 00:10:40,161
But last night he was
in his bed, and he...

166
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,427
- Have you searched the grounds? And?
- Every inch. Nothing.

167
00:10:43,499 --> 00:10:46,559
- He's gone.
- Oh, imbecile.

168
00:10:46,636 --> 00:10:49,935
Wha... [Gasps]
Oh, good heavens.

169
00:10:50,006 --> 00:10:53,066
What is this?

170
00:10:53,142 --> 00:10:55,667
A clue.

171
00:10:55,745 --> 00:10:58,908
We must inform the peasants.

172
00:10:58,982 --> 00:11:03,282
- [Crowd Cheering]
- ##

173
00:11:03,353 --> 00:11:06,151
- ## [Stops]
- Good people of Moscow.

174
00:11:06,222 --> 00:11:09,350
The prince has been kidnapped.

175
00:11:09,425 --> 00:11:14,226
- [Crowd Gasping]
- But I know who has stolen our czar.

176
00:11:14,297 --> 00:11:19,530
For she left this iron tooth behind.

177
00:11:19,602 --> 00:11:21,536
Baba Yaga!

178
00:11:21,604 --> 00:11:23,868
- Baba Yaga!
- Oh!

179
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,500
Yes. Baba Yaga.

180
00:11:26,576 --> 00:11:29,773
Can anyone help us?

181
00:11:29,846 --> 00:11:31,780
Think, good people, think.

182
00:11:31,848 --> 00:11:37,286
Who... Who can rescue our prince
from the evil Baba Yaga?

183
00:11:37,353 --> 00:11:39,116
I know someone.

184
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:44,717
Hey, Zozi,
will you take it easy up there?

185
00:11:44,794 --> 00:11:47,661
Aargh!
Avast there, me pint-sized matey.

186
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,790
Man the helm.
Batten down the hatches.

187
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:54,462
Rough seas ahead.
There's a storm a-comin'.

188
00:11:54,537 --> 00:11:57,233
Heave ho!
Hard a-starboard!

189
00:11:57,307 --> 00:12:01,471
[Parrot] All hands, clear the deck.
Splice the mainsail.

190
00:12:01,544 --> 00:12:04,308
Enemies on the horizon.

191
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,144
- What, somebody's comin'?
- Aargh!

192
00:12:07,216 --> 00:12:11,915
I spy with my... my little eye...

193
00:12:13,723 --> 00:12:17,090
Cossacks. Cossacks!

194
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,652
Cossacks! I knew you shouldn't
have kept that ring!

195
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,996
Quick, hide. If they see you're
not dead, we will be. Hurry!

196
00:12:25,068 --> 00:12:27,593
Hurry. Hide.

197
00:12:29,005 --> 00:12:31,337
- Halt!
- All righty. Halting.

198
00:12:31,407 --> 00:12:34,934
Are you Bartok the Magnificent?

199
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:38,174
Uh, no. No, I'm not.
Never have been.

200
00:12:38,247 --> 00:12:41,273
- Although I hear he is quite gifted.
A real talent.
- Silence!

201
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:46,550
All right, I'll just be quiet then.
That's no problem for me to be quiet.

202
00:12:46,622 --> 00:12:48,954
- I'll just shush it right down.
- What is that?

203
00:12:49,025 --> 00:12:52,119
Uh... Ooh.

204
00:12:52,195 --> 00:12:55,187
That's Bertok.
Bertok the Magnificent.

205
00:12:55,264 --> 00:13:00,361
It's really quite different. I take
my show in a whole nother direction.

206
00:13:00,436 --> 00:13:02,870
You are coming with us.

207
00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:05,908
Oh, no, fellas, I really...
I have a thing...

208
00:13:05,975 --> 00:13:08,500
Okay, then, that'll be fun.

209
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:20,386
##

210
00:13:20,456 --> 00:13:23,220
Hello, Your Royal Impressiveness.

211
00:13:23,292 --> 00:13:26,159
Listen, if this is about the ring,
just take it.

212
00:13:26,229 --> 00:13:28,493
[Cossack]
Bow before the Regent. Bow!

213
00:13:28,564 --> 00:13:32,660
Okay, there. Bowing, bowing. Don't have
to tell me twice. I love a good bow.

214
00:13:32,735 --> 00:13:35,101
##

215
00:13:35,171 --> 00:13:38,004
Oh, Bartok the Magnificent,

216
00:13:38,074 --> 00:13:41,407
we're so glad you came.

217
00:13:41,477 --> 00:13:45,743
- Please, l... You are?
- Hmm?

218
00:13:45,815 --> 00:13:51,253
- Our young czar has been taken
by the evil witch Baba Yaga.
- Aah!

219
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:56,087
Our people and the royal family
have called on you to save him.

220
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:59,185
- Ah-huh.
- Don't even think...

221
00:13:59,262 --> 00:14:01,992
Go to the Iron Forest...

222
00:14:02,065 --> 00:14:05,466
and return with our czar.

223
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:11,299
Uh, good people
of the fair city of Moscow,

224
00:14:11,374 --> 00:14:14,969
it would give me no greater pleasure
than to risk my life...

225
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:17,945
so that I might bring back
your fabulous prince.

226
00:14:18,014 --> 00:14:22,075
I mean that. I wouldn't just say that.
He's really something special.

227
00:14:22,151 --> 00:14:26,918
Unfortunately,
my schedule is extremely tight.

228
00:14:26,989 --> 00:14:29,981
Let's see.
I've got a Hydra in St. Petersburg.

229
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:34,223
I gotta be in the Ukraine on the 20th.
I can't get outta that.

230
00:14:34,297 --> 00:14:38,631
Perhaps I could squeeze it in
when I get back from Minsk.

231
00:14:38,701 --> 00:14:41,033
I assure you,

232
00:14:41,104 --> 00:14:44,904
you will be handsomely rewarded.

233
00:14:44,974 --> 00:14:47,238
No, no, really, l...

234
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,905
- Well, perhaps I could push
the Hydra toJune.
- [Grunts]

235
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,574
L... l... I mean no.
I really... I can't.

236
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:57,415
Hydra, terrible, eight heads,
flailing about, eatin' people.

237
00:14:57,487 --> 00:15:01,480
It's... It's not pretty.
But thank you. Thank you very much.

238
00:15:01,557 --> 00:15:03,855
Mr. Bartok?

239
00:15:03,926 --> 00:15:06,588
Oh, boy, here comes trouble.

240
00:15:06,662 --> 00:15:09,688
Oh, please, magnificent Bartok,

241
00:15:09,765 --> 00:15:11,960
save my czar.

242
00:15:12,034 --> 00:15:13,968
Don't do it.

243
00:15:14,036 --> 00:15:16,971
Um, well, you see,

244
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:19,303
it's... it's complicated, but...

245
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,969
- [Grunting]
- But, um,

246
00:15:22,044 --> 00:15:25,411
- l...
- Please.

247
00:15:27,483 --> 00:15:31,579
- Ah, I'll do it.
- Oh, no.

248
00:15:31,654 --> 00:15:34,589
Hey, come on, huh?
How often do you get to rescue a czar?

249
00:15:34,657 --> 00:15:36,591
Yea, Bartok!

250
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:39,432
- Or eaten by a witch?
- [Ludmilla] Thank you.

251
00:15:42,435 --> 00:15:45,996
Okay, thanks for the send-off, fellas.

252
00:15:46,072 --> 00:15:48,199
I'll... take it from here.

253
00:15:49,442 --> 00:15:52,809
Zozi, how's it going in there?

254
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:55,370
Uh, listen,
I'll let you out in a second,

255
00:15:55,448 --> 00:15:57,780
but first I just wanna let you know...

256
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,479
what a very special friend
I think you are.

257
00:16:01,554 --> 00:16:04,990
You're warm, you're affectionate,
you're supportive,

258
00:16:05,057 --> 00:16:08,356
honest, thrifty, clean, reverent...

259
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:10,395
You're furious.

260
00:16:12,398 --> 00:16:14,730
You're upset with me, aren't you?

261
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,497
You're peeved, you're miffed.
You can say it. Go ahead.
You're fuming. You're incensed.

262
00:16:18,571 --> 00:16:21,062
- Bartok...
- Hang on. I'm not finished.

263
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,665
- You're irate. You're beside yourself.
- Bartok...

264
00:16:23,743 --> 00:16:27,406
I mean, literally,
you're here and yet you're here.

265
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,347
[Laughs]
You see, the... You get it?

266
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:33,078
Because you're here and yet...

267
00:16:33,152 --> 00:16:35,848
All right, they all can't be gems,
all right? I'm done.

268
00:16:35,922 --> 00:16:38,390
I believe we should do it.

269
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:41,187
It was the little girl.
She killed me.

270
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:46,129
Did you hear the lilt in her voice?
Nobody could resist that.

271
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:48,928
- I'm sorry. What did you say?
- We should do it.

272
00:16:49,001 --> 00:16:51,367
- We should?
- Yes.

273
00:16:51,437 --> 00:16:54,565
- Now, there's no denying
it will be difficult.
- Right, exactly.

274
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,835
- Even dangerous.
- Dangerous?

275
00:16:56,909 --> 00:17:00,276
Okay, well, then that's it. We're
definitely going to St. Petersburg.

276
00:17:00,346 --> 00:17:03,804
Bartok, these people asked you
to help them for a reason.

277
00:17:04,183 --> 00:17:07,118
Because they saw
something in you.

278
00:17:07,186 --> 00:17:10,121
Is it so hard for you
to see it in yourself?

279
00:17:12,758 --> 00:17:14,555
# Somebody needs you #

280
00:17:14,627 --> 00:17:17,960
#And that's how it starts #

281
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,466
# Someone believes you'll come through #

282
00:17:21,534 --> 00:17:23,092
#You're scared
So what #

283
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:25,660
# I'll bet you've got #

284
00:17:25,738 --> 00:17:29,970
#A possible hero in you #

285
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:34,536
#It's more than courage
orjust being strong #

286
00:17:34,614 --> 00:17:38,914
#Those things are easy to do #

287
00:17:38,985 --> 00:17:41,146
# Have faith
Take heart #

288
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,279
# He's kind, he's smart #

289
00:17:43,356 --> 00:17:48,259
#That possible hero in you #

290
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:51,990
- # Close your eyes #
- I think I see it.

291
00:17:52,064 --> 00:17:55,158
#You're unafraid #

292
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:57,168
It just might be.

293
00:17:57,236 --> 00:18:01,832
# I can almost predict #

294
00:18:01,907 --> 00:18:05,809
No more tricks, no more false pretenses
from the back of a wagon.

295
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:08,278
Maybe I'll save a life someday.

296
00:18:08,347 --> 00:18:13,182
# Or slay a dragon #

297
00:18:13,252 --> 00:18:17,348
- # Somebody needs you #
- #What else can you do #

298
00:18:17,423 --> 00:18:21,450
# But take your chances and see #

299
00:18:21,527 --> 00:18:23,586
#We're on our way #

300
00:18:23,663 --> 00:18:26,131
- All right?
- Okay.

301
00:18:26,198 --> 00:18:28,359
#A possible hero #

302
00:18:28,434 --> 00:18:30,368
# Impossible hero #

303
00:18:30,436 --> 00:18:35,032
#A possible hero #

304
00:18:35,107 --> 00:18:36,631
- # In you #
- In me?

305
00:18:36,709 --> 00:18:39,007
Yes, you.

306
00:18:39,078 --> 00:18:41,706
# In me ##

307
00:18:46,452 --> 00:18:50,320
[Bartok]
Gee, who does her landscaping?

308
00:18:57,063 --> 00:18:59,657
Okay, well, it's official.
I'm frightened.

309
00:18:59,732 --> 00:19:04,396
Well, there's your witch's hut.

310
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,904
[Bartok]
Gee, looky here.

311
00:19:06,972 --> 00:19:08,997
[Both Screaming]

312
00:19:11,077 --> 00:19:14,205
[Evil Laughter]

313
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,580
I'm terribly sorry.
Did I startle you?

314
00:19:18,651 --> 00:19:21,085
Yah, yah.
You could say that.

315
00:19:21,153 --> 00:19:25,681
Mmm.
Now, why have you come here?

316
00:19:25,758 --> 00:19:27,851
L-I've come for Prince Ivan.

317
00:19:27,927 --> 00:19:29,861
Delightful.

318
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:32,921
And how might I help you?

319
00:19:32,998 --> 00:19:35,990
Well, you just let him in here
to talk to that evil witch Baba Yaga.

320
00:19:36,068 --> 00:19:40,266
- He'll handle the rest.
- And you're certain
you're up to the task?

321
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:43,604
Have you ever heard
of Bartok the Magnificent?

322
00:19:43,676 --> 00:19:46,543
- Oh, should I have?
- Mm-hmm.

323
00:19:46,612 --> 00:19:48,739
- Do you like riddles?
- Riddles?

324
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:52,306
- Riddles?
- Could you answer one?

325
00:19:52,384 --> 00:19:54,750
If I do, will you let me in?

326
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,687
Why not? Let me see.

327
00:19:57,757 --> 00:20:01,989
Oh. [Evil Laughter]
Ready?

328
00:20:02,061 --> 00:20:06,157
If a section of fence
is 68 feet long and 5 feet wide...

329
00:20:06,232 --> 00:20:08,257
and the parallel section
is the same length,

330
00:20:08,334 --> 00:20:10,529
but both perpendicular sections
are twice as long...

331
00:20:10,603 --> 00:20:12,594
Carry the six, plus the two...

332
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:16,198
What is the key
that will open the witch's door?

333
00:20:16,275 --> 00:20:19,733
I'm sorry. I lost you there.
What was that last part?

334
00:20:19,812 --> 00:20:25,409
What is the key
that will open the witch's door?

335
00:20:25,484 --> 00:20:29,079
- I thought it was an arithmetic thing.
- A skeleton key.

336
00:20:29,155 --> 00:20:31,555
[Roaring]

337
00:20:32,992 --> 00:20:36,928
That's exactly
what I was just gonna say.
A skeleton key.

338
00:20:36,996 --> 00:20:40,762
Zozi, you jumped the gun on me there.
Come on.

339
00:20:43,002 --> 00:20:44,765
- Ooooh!
- Hey!

340
00:20:44,837 --> 00:20:47,533
Mmm-mm-mm.

341
00:20:47,606 --> 00:20:49,870
Did you hear me say...

342
00:20:49,942 --> 00:20:52,342
you could go in?

343
00:20:52,411 --> 00:20:55,380
You go on ahead.
I'll wait for you here.

344
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:57,711
- But...
- Apparently, I'm not permitted.

345
00:20:57,783 --> 00:21:02,379
And as much as it might pain me
to not be with you
at this critical juncture in your life,

346
00:21:02,454 --> 00:21:05,821
I accept it, fully aware,
as you should be,

347
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:09,383
that I am with you in spirit.

348
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:12,123
- In spirit, huh?
- Always.

349
00:21:12,198 --> 00:21:15,964
"Once more into the breach,
dear friends, once more.

350
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:20,495
Or close the wall up
with our English dead in peace."

351
00:21:20,573 --> 00:21:24,407
Thanks for mentioning the dead, really.
That's real helpful.

352
00:21:24,476 --> 00:21:27,172
- [Zozi Continues Reading]
- Hmm.

353
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,850
[Sighs]

354
00:21:36,422 --> 00:21:38,356
Whoa-oh.

355
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:46,197
Oh, would you look at that?

356
00:21:58,244 --> 00:22:00,940
Hello!

357
00:22:01,013 --> 00:22:03,106
Prince Ivan?

358
00:22:03,182 --> 00:22:05,446
Anybody home?

359
00:22:08,854 --> 00:22:10,788
Hmm?

360
00:22:12,858 --> 00:22:16,713
[Clattering]

361
00:22:16,846 --> 00:22:18,814
[Woman]
Who...

362
00:22:18,882 --> 00:22:23,649
is in my house?

363
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,086
##[Jazz]

364
00:22:30,994 --> 00:22:33,827
I smell a rat.

365
00:22:33,897 --> 00:22:38,925
#A witch's life
is very solitary #

366
00:22:39,002 --> 00:22:43,166
# No one around
to talk to but trees #

367
00:22:43,239 --> 00:22:48,336
# So many years
of never makin' merry #

368
00:22:48,411 --> 00:22:52,006
#But I can feel
a change in the breeze #

369
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:56,177
# 'Cause tonight there's
no one in the hallway #

370
00:22:56,252 --> 00:22:58,516
# No one left or right #

371
00:22:58,588 --> 00:23:01,113
# But my hallways all say #

372
00:23:01,191 --> 00:23:03,455
# Someone's in my house tonight #

373
00:23:03,526 --> 00:23:05,960
# No one by my fire #

374
00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:08,293
# No one sippin' tea #

00:23:08,364 --> 00:23:10,958
#My fire's burnin'higher #

376
00:23:11,034 --> 00:23:13,298
# Someone's in my house with me #

# We know that someone is near, dear #

381
00:23:23,613 --> 00:23:25,979
# No one in the attic #

382
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:28,540
# No one in my chair #

00:23:28,618 --> 00:23:30,984

#Someone's in my house
somewhere #

- # Where are you #

00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:38,321
#You wouldn't desert me
You know it would hurt me.

387
00:23:38,394 --> 00:23:41,261
- # Where is he, where is he #
- #Where are you #

#Little no one
you're through, ooh #

#And no one's

399
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,764
- Ah!
- Whoo!

400
00:24:17,834 --> 00:24:20,268
Well, that was...
convenient for you.

401
00:24:20,336 --> 00:24:24,136
- Quiet!
- Okay, sure, whatever you say.
Not another peep.

402
00:24:24,207 --> 00:24:29,042
You broke into my home.

403
00:24:29,112 --> 00:24:32,172
Well, actually,
your big head out there by the gate,

404
00:24:32,248 --> 00:24:34,375
he gave me a key.

405
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:37,214
Why don't you just hang on to that.
That's fine.

406
00:24:37,287 --> 00:24:41,223
Shh!
Ah, you've come for the prince.

407
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:43,885
- Ah, mm-hmm.
- But why have they sent you?

408
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,520
Filthy little creature.

409
00:24:46,596 --> 00:24:49,156
Not quite a rat, not quite a bird.

410
00:24:49,232 --> 00:24:54,966
You certainly are not
a worthy adversary for me,

411
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:58,132
the evil Baba Yaga!

412
00:24:58,207 --> 00:25:01,904
Yeah, well,
appearances can be deceiving.

413
00:25:01,978 --> 00:25:05,106
- I think.
- Yes, they can.

414
00:25:05,181 --> 00:25:07,115
[Laughing]

415
00:25:07,183 --> 00:25:11,313
I know where the prince is.
[Laughing]

416
00:25:11,387 --> 00:25:13,821
Oh, what a shocker.

417
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:17,826
[Coughs]
Okay, okay, I'll stop. I'll stop.

418
00:25:17,894 --> 00:25:22,854
However, in order for me
to show you where he is,

419
00:25:22,932 --> 00:25:28,427
you must first prove
that you are worthy of saving him.

420
00:25:28,504 --> 00:25:32,440
Oh, listen, I'm extremely worthy.
They don't come more worthy than...

421
00:25:32,508 --> 00:25:35,078
Sorry, sorry. Can't help it.
You go ahead.

422
00:25:35,078 --> 00:25:35,442
Sorry, sorry. Can't help it.
You go ahead.

423
00:25:35,511 --> 00:25:38,776
There are three things
I seek within my forest.

424
00:25:38,848 --> 00:25:41,476
I will tell you
where to find them...

425
00:25:41,551 --> 00:25:44,850
and you must bring them to me.

426
00:25:44,921 --> 00:25:49,290
Quick question. Totally hypothetical,
of course. What if I can't?

427
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:51,293
You can or you can't.

428
00:25:51,361 --> 00:25:56,526
But if you can't,
you will die not a hero,

429
00:25:56,599 --> 00:26:00,535
and Moscow will never
see its prince again.

430
00:26:00,603 --> 00:26:04,130
Sounds like a real win-win.
When do I start?

431
00:26:04,207 --> 00:26:08,200
[Laughs, Snorts] You already have.
[Laughs, Snorts]

432
00:26:08,277 --> 00:26:12,270
- I have?
- Head south to the ice quarry...

433
00:26:12,348 --> 00:26:14,282
and bring Piloff to me.

434
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:18,582
- Bring Piloff. That's it?
Bring Piloff to you?
- [Growls]

435
00:26:18,654 --> 00:26:21,122
Nah, it's just I thought
you were gonna say more.

436
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,488
Okay, how am I gonna know this Piloff?

437
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:28,394
Aach! Go. And tell your furry friend
if he helps you in any way,

438
00:26:28,464 --> 00:26:30,398
you'll both die.

439
00:26:30,466 --> 00:26:33,492
Okay, now, that I really
should be writing down.

440
00:26:33,569 --> 00:26:37,403
"Both die."
It's the little things.

441
00:26:37,473 --> 00:26:39,634
Wind.

442
00:26:39,709 --> 00:26:44,078
Whoa! Okay, well,
I guess I'm gonna go now!

443
00:26:44,147 --> 00:26:46,411
I'll catch ya later!

444
00:26:51,254 --> 00:26:56,351
He's actually rather charming
for an oversized skull,

445
00:26:56,426 --> 00:26:58,986
once you get past
his inquisitive nature.

446
00:26:59,062 --> 00:27:03,021
- Gosh, I feel like we've
been walking for hours here.
- We have.

447
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:06,933
- I have absolutely no idea where we are.
- Mm.

448
00:27:07,003 --> 00:27:10,439
Not unlike Oedipus,
blinded with his mother's broach.

449
00:27:10,506 --> 00:27:13,634
Left to wander the earth,
never knowing...

450
00:27:13,709 --> 00:27:16,678
- [Bartok] Zozi.
- I'm doing it again. I'll stop.

451
00:27:16,746 --> 00:27:20,614
Is it getting cold?
I must say, it is rather exciting.

452
00:27:20,683 --> 00:27:24,710
The first of three gifts
you must search out and bring to her.

453
00:27:24,787 --> 00:27:27,347
- Uh-huh.
- And I can't help in any way.

454
00:27:27,423 --> 00:27:29,891
That's what she said.

455
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:32,052
I am freezing.

456
00:27:32,128 --> 00:27:34,562
Why is it getting so cold?

457
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,825
[Childlike Voice]
Well, hello there.

458
00:27:36,899 --> 00:27:39,629
Bingo. Piloff.

459
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:44,566
Aha.

460
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,244
Hello there.
[Laughing]

461
00:27:49,312 --> 00:27:52,110
I never get visitors.

462
00:27:52,181 --> 00:27:54,911
This is... You know what this is?
It's a pleasure.

463
00:27:54,984 --> 00:27:58,147
- It's an absolute pleasure.
- You must be Piloff.

464
00:27:58,221 --> 00:28:02,317
And you must be lost.
How delightful.

465
00:28:02,391 --> 00:28:05,087
That's it? A little hike,
some cold weather...

466
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:07,789
then bring this little thing
back to the witch?

467
00:28:07,864 --> 00:28:11,027
This is gonna be a piece of cake!

468
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,160
Oh. Oh, my goodness.

469
00:28:14,237 --> 00:28:16,171
- Hey there. I'm Bartok.
- Oh!

470
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:18,469
Sorry about this, my little friend,

471
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:21,339
but I gotta bring you
back to Baba Yaga.

472
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,344
Ah!

473
00:28:23,412 --> 00:28:28,509
- Oh, dear. This isn't good.
You see, I'm stuck.
- Ah!

474
00:28:28,584 --> 00:28:31,018
- Ow!
- It's unbearable.

475
00:28:31,087 --> 00:28:35,183
I don't even know how long
I've been here. What year is this?

476
00:28:35,258 --> 00:28:38,785
- Oh, boy.
- How's it going?

477
00:28:38,861 --> 00:28:41,352
[Bartok]
It's not going good!

478
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,921
[Grunting]

479
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,366
Ooh, that tickles.
[Laughing]

480
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:48,460
[Grunting]

481
00:28:48,538 --> 00:28:51,371
Pull, pull, pull.
Yes! Yes!

482
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,102
Pulllllll!

483
00:28:54,177 --> 00:28:57,112
It's enough to drive you crazy,
isn't it?

484
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:00,343
[Both Laughing]

485
00:29:00,416 --> 00:29:02,714
Uh... Oh, boy.

486
00:29:02,785 --> 00:29:05,686
- [Yelling]
- [Crash]
- Whoa!

487
00:29:05,755 --> 00:29:09,054
From the sound of it,
you're making great progress.

488
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,726
- [Grunting]
- [Piloff] Oh, that was close.

489
00:29:13,796 --> 00:29:17,323
You know, I felt like
we almost had something there.

490
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,493
- Hmm.
- [Laughing]

491
00:29:19,569 --> 00:29:23,403
My goodness, you are determined.

492
00:29:23,472 --> 00:29:25,667
I love that.

493
00:29:25,741 --> 00:29:28,835
This whole thing is very exciting.

494
00:29:28,911 --> 00:29:32,711
- Okeydokey.
- Artichokey. [Giggling]

495
00:29:32,782 --> 00:29:36,513
[Bartok]
My friend, we're going to Baba Yaga's,

496
00:29:36,586 --> 00:29:39,521
with or without the extra baggage.

497
00:29:39,589 --> 00:29:43,423
Such fun.
I'm having entirely too much fun.

498
00:29:43,492 --> 00:29:47,258
Yeah, well, that makes one of us.
[Grunts]

499
00:29:49,332 --> 00:29:51,766
Wa-ha!

500
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:56,096
Wheeeeeee!

501
00:29:57,506 --> 00:29:58,939
Hi-ya!

502
00:30:00,343 --> 00:30:02,777
- [Piloff] Oh, careful, careful.
- Whoa!

503
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:08,276
- Wheeeeee! [Laughing]
- Intriguing.

504
00:30:08,351 --> 00:30:12,049
Bartok, I've landed and I'm unharmed.

505
00:30:12,182 --> 00:30:15,413
Are you still on the boulder?

506
00:30:15,486 --> 00:30:18,319
- Um, yes!
- Whoop-de-do.

507
00:30:18,388 --> 00:30:21,084
What a strong little bat.

508
00:30:21,158 --> 00:30:23,991
You're actually doing quite well.
I'm very impressed.

509
00:30:24,061 --> 00:30:26,029
[Groans]

510
00:30:28,899 --> 00:30:31,834
This is one of those days
you never forget,

511
00:30:31,902 --> 00:30:36,532
when everything you wanted to happen
happens, only better.

512
00:30:36,607 --> 00:30:40,099
I'm beside myself.
You know what, Bartok?

513
00:30:40,177 --> 00:30:43,112
You should try
and remember this too.

514
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:47,617
Yeah, I'll make a mental note.
All right? [Grunts]

515
00:30:47,684 --> 00:30:50,710
Wheeeeeeee!
[Laughing]

516
00:30:50,787 --> 00:30:53,847
Ah, talk about fun.
We did it, Bartok.

517
00:30:53,924 --> 00:30:57,291
That was a blast.
Wheeeeeeeee!

518
00:30:57,361 --> 00:31:00,626
Ah! Can you believe this, Bartok?

519
00:31:00,697 --> 00:31:03,791
We dragged this big old boulder
all the way across the forest,

520
00:31:03,867 --> 00:31:06,768
and I pop off ten feet
from the house.

521
00:31:06,837 --> 00:31:10,466
- That's funny.
- Yeah, that's hysterical.

522
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:15,638
- Ah!
- And where, pray tell,
do you think you're going?

523
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:19,978
- In to see Baba Yaga.
- Do you have a key?

524
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:24,384
No, she took it. Ah, come on.
You're kidding, right?

525
00:31:24,454 --> 00:31:26,752
# Me me me #
[Clears Throat]

526
00:31:26,823 --> 00:31:30,054
No matter how hard you hit me,

527
00:31:30,127 --> 00:31:33,153
no matter how much I hurt,

528
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:37,064
I'm always good for a laugh.
What am I?

529
00:31:37,134 --> 00:31:39,728
Hmm. A funny bone.

530
00:31:39,803 --> 00:31:43,330
- Funny bone. Ha ha. Key, please.
- [Grunts]

531
00:31:44,908 --> 00:31:47,172
Much obliged.

532
00:31:47,244 --> 00:31:51,010
You're really quite good
at solving riddles.

533
00:31:51,081 --> 00:31:54,107
I say, have you heard this one?

534
00:31:54,184 --> 00:31:58,450
- What starts off
in the morning on four legs?
- Ah, you brought me Piloff.

535
00:31:58,522 --> 00:32:03,425
Hello, Baba. I was stuck to a rock.

536
00:32:03,493 --> 00:32:07,520
- [Laughing]
- Oh, boy.

537
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:11,533
Ah! Ow.

538
00:32:11,602 --> 00:32:13,934
Uh, uh, uh.
Don't sit.

539
00:32:14,004 --> 00:32:17,531
But I'm tired.

540
00:32:17,608 --> 00:32:19,509
Okay, okay, I'm not sitting.

541
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:20,441
Okay, okay, I'm not sitting.

542
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,444
Now,

543
00:32:22,512 --> 00:32:26,539
go fetch me the crown
of Oble the metalworker.

544
00:32:26,617 --> 00:32:29,711
Oble? He sounds big.
Is he big?

545
00:32:29,786 --> 00:32:32,778
Enormous.

546
00:32:32,856 --> 00:32:36,383
- He's much bigger than you.
- Piloff!

547
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:39,554
- Sorry.
- Go!
- But I'm exhausted.

548
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:44,624
Or if you don't,
Prince Ivan will be doomed.

549
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:48,398
- Which way?
- Walk east until it's dark.

550
00:32:48,472 --> 00:32:52,568
Then look for a fire in the forest.

551
00:32:52,643 --> 00:32:55,441
That's it, huh?
Walk east and look for fire.

552
00:32:55,512 --> 00:32:58,310
No "thank you"?
No "nice work"? Nothing.

553
00:32:58,382 --> 00:33:03,251
Yes, one last thing.
Give me the key.

554
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,255
Ah, but why?
I solved the riddle twice already.

555
00:33:06,323 --> 00:33:09,918
Give it to me.

556
00:33:09,993 --> 00:33:13,156
- Okay, that's yours.
Go ahead and take that.
- [Laughing]

557
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:17,667
Sheesh, helping people
sure can take it out of ya.

558
00:33:17,734 --> 00:33:21,568
[Ludmilla]
Good people of Moscow,

559
00:33:21,638 --> 00:33:24,198
the prince has been taken from us.

560
00:33:24,274 --> 00:33:27,141
God willing he will be returned.

561
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:31,169
But in the meantime,
the affairs of state must continue.

562
00:33:31,248 --> 00:33:34,706
And I, as Regent,
will do my best...

563
00:33:34,785 --> 00:33:38,152
to carry on and ensure the safety of...

564
00:33:38,221 --> 00:33:40,781
and respect for...

565
00:33:40,857 --> 00:33:44,293
the throne... of Russia.

566
00:33:48,865 --> 00:33:53,495
This is ridiculous. I'm out here
working my wings off, and for what?

567
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:57,267
I tell ya, if I get back
and she dumps this crown into her stew,

568
00:33:57,341 --> 00:33:59,775
I'm gonna have a cow.

569
00:33:59,843 --> 00:34:04,109
- Meanwhile, I ain't seen
hide nor hair of that prince.
- [Grunts]

570
00:34:04,181 --> 00:34:06,342
Oh, would ya look at that.

571
00:34:06,416 --> 00:34:11,115
[Zozi] He is large.
There's no denying it.

572
00:34:11,188 --> 00:34:14,123
- But perhaps he's friendly.
- You think?

573
00:34:14,191 --> 00:34:19,288
[Mumbling, Growling]

574
00:34:19,363 --> 00:34:21,297
Let's try, huh?

575
00:34:21,365 --> 00:34:25,028
I'll just... I'll just shout to him
and ask him if I can borrow his hat.

576
00:34:25,102 --> 00:34:29,436
I'll drop Baba Yaga's name. Maybe
they're friends. What could it hurt?

577
00:34:29,506 --> 00:34:32,441
- Hello, good sir!
- [Grunts]

578
00:34:32,509 --> 00:34:34,841
[Growls]

579
00:34:36,913 --> 00:34:40,349
Yes, very good.
Uh, we come bearing gifts, sir.

580
00:34:40,417 --> 00:34:41,782
[Grunts]

581
00:34:41,852 --> 00:34:47,518
Uh, well, not real gifts,
but gifts of warmth and affection.

582
00:34:47,591 --> 00:34:50,287
[Growling]

583
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,797
In exchange for which we'd just love to
bring your headdress back to Baba Yaga.

584
00:34:54,865 --> 00:35:00,303
Aaba Raaba.
Pee wan foof poo mee nana.

585
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:04,466
- What did he say?
- I just don't have a clue.
- [Growls]

586
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:09,137
Diction, my dear boy. It can make
all the difference in the world.

587
00:35:09,212 --> 00:35:11,646
- Carry on, Bartok.
- Oh! Ah! Hot! Oh, that's hot.

588
00:35:11,715 --> 00:35:15,651
- It's hot. It's hot.
- Manna ooo boorin eeeeear?

589
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:19,155
Yeah, you and me both,
my friend, I'm sure.

590
00:35:19,222 --> 00:35:23,625
We just need to get that crown of yours
and we'll be on our way.

591
00:35:23,693 --> 00:35:27,151
[Mumbling, Roaring]

592
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:30,495
- Aah!
- [Growling]

593
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,664
- [Banging]
- Oopsie.

594
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:40,005
Ah, ah. [Growls]

595
00:35:40,076 --> 00:35:44,342
- Okay. Hmm. How about this?
- [Grunts]

596
00:35:44,414 --> 00:35:47,906
Well, how about... Hey, it's hot.
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

597
00:35:47,984 --> 00:35:50,418
- Hot, hot, hot.
- Yaya. Boogaler?

598
00:35:50,487 --> 00:35:55,083
- Part of the show. Totally planned.
- [Excited Grunts]

599
00:35:55,158 --> 00:35:57,922
Stay with me now,
'cause here comes the good stuff.

600
00:35:57,994 --> 00:35:59,928
Abraca-woozi!

601
00:35:59,996 --> 00:36:02,863
[Grunting, Laughing]

602
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,591
[Grunting Continues]

603
00:36:08,171 --> 00:36:10,867
Eeyyy, boogaler.

604
00:36:10,941 --> 00:36:13,205
[Grunting]

605
00:36:13,276 --> 00:36:15,267
[Groaning]

606
00:36:15,345 --> 00:36:20,044
- [Grunting]
- Bravo!

607
00:36:20,116 --> 00:36:22,949
- Zozi, let's roll.
- [Roaring]

608
00:36:23,019 --> 00:36:25,453
[Both Screaming]

609
00:36:26,523 --> 00:36:28,457
Bartok, he's still coming.

610
00:36:29,693 --> 00:36:32,287
[Roaring]

611
00:36:40,704 --> 00:36:44,140
[Relieved Sigh]

612
00:36:48,645 --> 00:36:51,637
[Piloff Laughing]

613
00:36:51,715 --> 00:36:55,651
Would you look at you?
You did it! You did it!

614
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:58,813
- He's something special.
- Quiet, Piloff.

615
00:37:09,499 --> 00:37:13,435
And she drops it in the soup.
Perfect.

616
00:37:13,503 --> 00:37:18,236
Tomorrow is the most
difficult task of all.

617
00:37:18,308 --> 00:37:22,142
- [Laughing]
- [Laughing]

618
00:37:22,212 --> 00:37:25,638
[Piloff]
Oh, dear.

619
00:37:29,341 --> 00:37:31,866
Hold the onions.

620
00:37:31,944 --> 00:37:34,037
Yeah, that's to go, please.

621
00:37:35,114 --> 00:37:37,878
Ay-yi-yi!
Yaah!

622
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:41,044
Hey, what's with the ruckus
first thing in the morning?

623
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:45,147
What happened to a nudge? What happened
to the smell of a nice cup of coffee?

624
00:37:45,224 --> 00:37:48,318
Using only this crown...

625
00:37:48,394 --> 00:37:51,090
and the boulder from the quarry,

626
00:37:51,163 --> 00:37:55,156
pluck the magic feather from the sky.

627
00:37:55,234 --> 00:37:57,168
Okay, let me stop you here
for just one sec.

628
00:37:57,236 --> 00:38:00,433
'Cause it's early,
I haven't eaten in about two days...

629
00:38:00,506 --> 00:38:02,440
and I'm a little agitated.

630
00:38:02,508 --> 00:38:05,909
- But what does this have
to do with the prince?
- Everything.

631
00:38:05,978 --> 00:38:10,574
'Cause from where I'm standing,
I'm just running errands
for your little broth there.

632
00:38:10,649 --> 00:38:14,085
Oh, I am so sorry.
How insensitive of me.

633
00:38:14,153 --> 00:38:16,348
Are you still tired?

634
00:38:16,422 --> 00:38:19,016
Honestly?
Yes. Yes, I am.

635
00:38:19,091 --> 00:38:21,753
- [Blowing]
- [Wind Howls]

636
00:38:21,827 --> 00:38:24,796
- [Cackling]
- [Yelling]

637
00:38:24,864 --> 00:38:28,527
Oh, oh, oh.
Are you awake now?

638
00:38:28,601 --> 00:38:31,934
Yes. Yes. You were saying
something about a feather?

639
00:38:32,004 --> 00:38:33,938
A magic feather.

640
00:38:34,006 --> 00:38:36,770
It floats high in the air,

641
00:38:36,842 --> 00:38:39,743
in the middle of a clearing.

642
00:38:39,812 --> 00:38:42,872
One feather comin' at ya.

643
00:38:42,948 --> 00:38:45,439
- Ah, one last thing.
- What's that?

644
00:38:45,518 --> 00:38:48,043
You cannot fly.

645
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,054
Whoa!

646
00:38:50,122 --> 00:38:52,784
[Cackling]

647
00:38:57,463 --> 00:38:59,397
Aah!

648
00:39:01,467 --> 00:39:04,630
- Oh! Ow!
- You can't fly?

649
00:39:04,703 --> 00:39:07,729
Nope. Hmm. Ow!

650
00:39:07,807 --> 00:39:10,401
How do I do this?
Help me here.

651
00:39:10,476 --> 00:39:13,070
- I can't.
- Hmm.

652
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:18,014
Maybe if I just try... Careful now.
I just wanna... [Grunts]

653
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:20,847
Ah! Ay, hot!

654
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,048
Oh, I'm exhausted.
I haven't eaten in days.

655
00:39:24,123 --> 00:39:27,354
This isn't the life for me.
Just forget it.

656
00:39:27,426 --> 00:39:29,690
#A possible hero in you ##

657
00:39:29,762 --> 00:39:31,696
But I tried.
I did the best I can do.

658
00:39:31,764 --> 00:39:35,530
We can get along without Moscow, and
I won't let that crazy witch find me.

659
00:39:35,601 --> 00:39:39,196
- Ah, well, thank goodness.
- Huh?

660
00:39:39,271 --> 00:39:42,672
Well, you can just imagine
if you had completed this task,

661
00:39:42,741 --> 00:39:45,209
everywhere we went
people would know who we are.

662
00:39:45,277 --> 00:39:50,374
We'd spend the rest of our lives
running around having to help people.

663
00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:54,146
The incessant grabbing
and touching of admirers.
It's more than one can bear.

664
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,313
Aah!

665
00:39:57,623 --> 00:39:59,557
It certainly is.

666
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:02,423
Now we can run away, hide from
Baba Yaga for a couple of years.

667
00:40:02,494 --> 00:40:05,588
Which is fine by me.
I'm behind on my hibernating anyway.

668
00:40:05,664 --> 00:40:07,598
Then take the show back on the road,

669
00:40:07,666 --> 00:40:12,069
and you can go on pretending
to be what you always wanted to be.

670
00:40:12,137 --> 00:40:14,230
Besides, this is absurd.

671
00:40:14,306 --> 00:40:18,106
How are you supposed
to get 35 feet in the air...

672
00:40:18,177 --> 00:40:22,079
with a large crown and a boulder?

673
00:40:22,147 --> 00:40:25,082
You just can't do it.

674
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:29,883
Well, no, I can't, especially now
that it's all in pieces like that.

675
00:40:29,955 --> 00:40:34,756
It's, um, in pieces. Aha.

676
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:45,593
But of course.
[Laughing]

677
00:40:45,671 --> 00:40:47,696
[Laughing Continues]

678
00:40:47,773 --> 00:40:50,901
Hi-ya! Tah-dah!

679
00:40:50,976 --> 00:40:53,672
Now we get the prince!

680
00:40:54,747 --> 00:40:57,375
When is a door not a door?

681
00:40:57,449 --> 00:40:59,917
When it's a jar.
Child's play.

682
00:40:59,985 --> 00:41:03,284
- [Grunting]
- Now, open wide. I'm coming through.

683
00:41:05,524 --> 00:41:09,517
Ha ha. I did it. There you go.
Three for three.

684
00:41:09,595 --> 00:41:12,393
You didn't think I had it in me,
did ya?

685
00:41:12,464 --> 00:41:16,059
Now, hand over the prince.

686
00:41:16,135 --> 00:41:20,003
You have given me the three things
I needed from the forest.

687
00:41:20,072 --> 00:41:23,064
But before I show you
where the prince is,

688
00:41:23,142 --> 00:41:26,134
I need something from you.

689
00:41:26,211 --> 00:41:31,376
But how can I know what that is
if you never told me? [Sighs]

690
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,975
Hmm.

691
00:41:35,888 --> 00:41:39,585
Is this a beauty or what?
They don't make 'em like this anymore.

692
00:41:39,658 --> 00:41:42,491
- No, that's not it.
- Okay.

693
00:41:44,063 --> 00:41:47,089
Okay, okay, here it is,
the mother lode.

694
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:50,624
An autographed portrait
of Ivan the Terrible.

695
00:41:50,703 --> 00:41:52,671
I, uh... I caught him in a good mood.

696
00:41:52,738 --> 00:41:56,640
- No, that's not it.
- No, huh?

697
00:41:57,943 --> 00:42:00,036
Well, how about...

698
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:06,242
- [Panting]
- It's something from here.

699
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:08,912
Huh.

700
00:42:08,988 --> 00:42:11,752
- Here. Here you go.
- [Cackling]

701
00:42:13,492 --> 00:42:16,689
- [Cackling Continues]
- Hey, what's so funny? Hey, stop it.

702
00:42:16,762 --> 00:42:19,925
Why don't you stop laughing
at other people's misery?

703
00:42:19,999 --> 00:42:23,435
- Uh-oh.
- You never told me
I had to give you something.

704
00:42:23,502 --> 00:42:27,734
You're a cheat and a liar, you babbling
old woman with your iron teeth...

705
00:42:27,806 --> 00:42:29,774
and your hocus-pocus.

706
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:33,778
- It's no wonder everybody hates you.
- [Gasps]

707
00:42:33,846 --> 00:42:37,680
- [Piloff] Bartok?
- Yeah? What do you want?

708
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:41,846
- Good-bye.
- Oh, yeah, sure. Good-bye.

709
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,514
- Huh?
- [Crying]

710
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:48,117
[Crying Continues]

711
00:42:50,863 --> 00:42:53,798
[Crying Continues]

712
00:42:59,204 --> 00:43:02,640
Um, what are you doing?

713
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:07,372
I'm just being a silly old woman.

714
00:43:07,446 --> 00:43:10,973
- [Crying Continues]
- [Sniffles]

715
00:43:19,391 --> 00:43:21,484
I didn't mean what I said.

716
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,495
Look, nobody hates you, okay?

717
00:43:24,563 --> 00:43:26,497
I just... l... ah... oh...

718
00:43:26,565 --> 00:43:30,831
I wish I could give you what you need.
[Sniffles]

719
00:43:30,903 --> 00:43:33,667
Oh.

720
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:39,343
Oh!

721
00:43:39,411 --> 00:43:41,743
- You just did.
- Huh?

722
00:43:41,814 --> 00:43:44,078
[Laughing]
Yes.

723
00:43:44,149 --> 00:43:47,676
The most important ingredient,

724
00:43:47,753 --> 00:43:50,347
from your heart.

725
00:43:50,422 --> 00:43:52,356
[Sizzles]

726
00:43:52,424 --> 00:43:57,691
And now he is worthy
and so he shall see. Come.

727
00:43:57,763 --> 00:44:01,859
Come. Hurry up, you little rat bird.
I don't have all day.

728
00:44:01,934 --> 00:44:03,868
Whoa, whoa.

729
00:44:11,577 --> 00:44:15,570
The tower.
[Laughing]

730
00:44:18,183 --> 00:44:20,708
Uh, you never took him, did ya?

731
00:44:20,786 --> 00:44:24,552
- I never said I did.
- You never took any children.

732
00:44:24,623 --> 00:44:26,989
- People will believe what they will.
- But...

733
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:30,654
I'm happy to live alone in the woods
and not be bothered.

734
00:44:30,729 --> 00:44:34,665
There. Take this.
You may need it.

735
00:44:34,733 --> 00:44:38,567
- What is it?
- A magic potion.

736
00:44:38,637 --> 00:44:42,129
This will allow you
to be your innermost self.

737
00:44:42,207 --> 00:44:45,233
When you drink it,

738
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:48,473
whatever you are
in your heart of hearts,

739
00:44:48,547 --> 00:44:53,746
you will become on the outside tenfold.

740
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:58,313
Wait a minute. You mean, the whole time
I was doing all that stuff for me?

741
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:02,656
Mm-hmm.
Now, leave me and save the prince.

742
00:45:02,728 --> 00:45:04,821
Um, could l...

743
00:45:04,897 --> 00:45:09,163
Um, how about a... a hug?

744
00:45:09,234 --> 00:45:11,930
- A hug?
- Come on. Bring it in.

745
00:45:12,004 --> 00:45:16,147
A hug?
Don't push your luck, Bartok.

746
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,113
- [Growls]
- All right, all right, all right.

747
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:23,017
- I'm outta here. Color me gone.
- [Cackling]

748
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:28,024
Yeah, and now all we have to do is tell
'em that the prince is in the tower...

749
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:31,084
and, boom,
we're on to St. Petersburg.

750
00:45:31,162 --> 00:45:34,529
- Uh, what are you doing?
- Finding an appropriate character.

751
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:39,593
Zozi, I hate to break this to you, but
you can't go. They think you're dead.

752
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:44,107
That is exactly why a rich
and multi-layered character is crucial.

753
00:45:44,175 --> 00:45:47,542
The right wardrobe,
a dab of well-placed grease paint,

754
00:45:47,612 --> 00:45:50,274
and none will be the wiser.

755
00:45:50,348 --> 00:45:53,875
Um, Zozi, just let me go tell 'em
where the prince is.

756
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:57,887
What if something goes wrong?
We still don't know who took the prince.

757
00:45:57,955 --> 00:46:01,049
Yeah, but... What is this?

758
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:03,218
- Cabbage.
- Cabbage?

759
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:05,387
That's your character?
Cabbage?

760
00:46:05,463 --> 00:46:10,400
Great. You're gonna
blend right in with the crowd.
A big six-foot-tall cabbage guy.

761
00:46:10,468 --> 00:46:13,232
Yes, but what could be more apropos...

762
00:46:13,304 --> 00:46:18,742
than Simka, the Russian peasant woman?

763
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:24,247
- I'm going, okay? You wait here.
- But...

764
00:46:24,315 --> 00:46:27,148
But nothing, okay?
I'll be right back.

765
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,913
##[Trumpets]

766
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:33,582
Ah! Ouch.

767
00:46:33,658 --> 00:46:36,024
Ah, brave bat,

768
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:39,927
you have returned
from your difficult journey.

769
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:42,488
Healthy, alive,

770
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:46,093
apparently no worse for the wear.

771
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:49,162
Our congratulations.

772
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:53,677
- [Cheering]
- But where is the prince?

773
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:58,010
[Clears Throat]
The prince never left the city.

774
00:46:58,082 --> 00:47:01,108
- [Crowd Gasping]
- Never left? I don't understand.

775
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:04,450
Okay, it's a little complicated
and fairly long-winded,

776
00:47:04,522 --> 00:47:06,615
so everybody listen up, huh?

777
00:47:06,691 --> 00:47:10,787
[Inhales] I left here,
a little fanfare, down into the forest.

778
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:13,853
Lots of trees there,
some gargoyles, big, big skull.

779
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:17,025
Solved a riddle, met Baba Yaga.
Not a looker, folks.

780
00:47:17,101 --> 00:47:19,035
Did three tasks.
Not important what they are.

781
00:47:19,103 --> 00:47:21,037
Suffice to say, at this point,

782
00:47:21,105 --> 00:47:25,804
I'm fairly confident of my physical,
emotional and intellectual prowess.

783
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:30,540
- But the prince.
- Hold on to your britches.
I'm getting there.

784
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:33,674
Me and the witch, we have a slight
disagreement. Some fisticuffs ensue.

785
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:36,379
I come out on top,
and she slips me this here potion.

786
00:47:36,454 --> 00:47:39,821
- See?
- A potion? For what?

787
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:42,415
Well, to be all that I can be,
basically.

788
00:47:42,493 --> 00:47:45,894
Since I did all the tasks,
I'm now worthy of saving the prince.

789
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:50,423
It... It makes you tenfold on the outside
what you are on the inside.

790
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:55,268
That's my understanding anyway.
Eh, eh, eh. Look, but don't touch,
fella, all right?

791
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:58,206
Sounds impressive, I know.
Let me break it down for you.

792
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:03,212
Essentially, if I ever need to be
more powerful than l... I already am,

793
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,340
I just give this here sucker
the old heave-ho.

794
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:10,080
Yes, but where is the prince?

795
00:48:10,154 --> 00:48:15,091
[Clears Throat]
Prince Ivan is in the tower.

796
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:17,855
- What?
- The tower. The tower.

797
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:21,022
Tall building, just outside
and to the right. You can't miss it.

798
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:26,001
My goodness. Well, we...
we must go to the tower at once.

799
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,197
Come.

800
00:48:30,608 --> 00:48:34,704
I warn you, if the prince
is not where you say he is...

801
00:48:34,779 --> 00:48:39,716
and this has all been part
of some elaborate performance,

802
00:48:39,784 --> 00:48:42,810
I assure you,
Bartok the Magnificent,

803
00:48:42,887 --> 00:48:47,119
the city of Moscow will have your head.

804
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,294
Tah-dah!

805
00:48:51,362 --> 00:48:54,058
What'd I tell ya?

806
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:56,065
- Hi, Ivan.
- Bartok?

807
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:58,067
My prince!

808
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:01,662
Whew! I got worried there for a sec
while we were climbing the stairs there,

809
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:03,798
I don't mind telling ya.

810
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:07,742
You with the talk about taking my head
and everything. Aah!

811
00:49:07,812 --> 00:49:11,304
- I still might.
- Hey, hey!

812
00:49:11,382 --> 00:49:13,407
You imbecile!
What is that?

813
00:49:13,484 --> 00:49:15,645
That... That's a prince?

814
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:18,313
Very good, yes.
Why didn't you do what I said?

815
00:49:18,389 --> 00:49:23,486
I did. I dressed up like the witch,
left that tooth and took the prince.

816
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:25,495
And what about him?

817
00:49:25,563 --> 00:49:27,758
But you told me
you wanted him out of the way.

818
00:49:27,832 --> 00:49:29,766
Well, what's he doing here?

819
00:49:29,834 --> 00:49:33,702
Well, I put him in that cage
in the tippy-top of the tower.

820
00:49:33,771 --> 00:49:35,830
How much more
out of the way could he be?

821
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:38,670
Dead, you imbecile!
Dead is what he could be. Dead!

822
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:41,176
Dead? But he's the prince.

823
00:49:41,245 --> 00:49:45,011
- Ah, may I interject something here?
- No, you may not.

824
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:48,882
- Okay.
- I never thought
I'd have to see you again.

825
00:49:48,953 --> 00:49:52,684
Stupid little bat.
It was all so perfect.

826
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:55,156
Eliminate the prince, frame Baba Yaga,

827
00:49:55,226 --> 00:49:57,285
send a hapless entertainer to save him.

828
00:49:57,361 --> 00:49:59,352
And yet, here you are.

829
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:04,231
The conquering hero, returning
from battle with all the answers!

830
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:06,292
Well, all the better.

831
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:08,304
- Vol? Get the prince.
- Yes?

832
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:11,466
Yes, Your Regency.

833
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:15,876
- You three are the only ones who know.
- [Vol] Hey!

834
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:18,506
And none of you will ever
leave this room...

835
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:21,380
[Chuckles]
Alive.

836
00:50:21,452 --> 00:50:23,477
[Grunting]

837
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:27,149
I'll take that.
Do svidanya.

838
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:31,558
[All Yelling]

839
