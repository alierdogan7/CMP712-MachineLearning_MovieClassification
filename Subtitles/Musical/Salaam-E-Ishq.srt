1
00:02:46,744 --> 00:02:50,441
lf not the first year, l've to give you
something at least the second year, no?

2
00:02:57,221 --> 00:02:59,121
Where did you get
the money for this?

3
00:03:01,726 --> 00:03:03,387
Where did you get the money?

4
00:03:04,862 --> 00:03:06,625
You sold your bike!?

5
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:10,265
But you love your bike so much...

6
00:03:11,202 --> 00:03:13,170
But l love you even more.

7
00:03:37,361 --> 00:03:41,457
But...l haven't got you anything.
- Oh, that's a problem.

8
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,464
Now you have to gift me
whatever l want!

9
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:46,459
Nothing naughty!

10
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:49,169
Should've thought of it before
marrying a naughty guy!

11
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:12,686
''On hot summer nights...''

12
00:04:13,164 --> 00:04:15,291
''l burn in the rain.''

13
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:19,462
''Lost in memories every moment.
What's my poor heart to do.''

14
00:04:20,905 --> 00:04:22,702
''Lost in my own thoughts am l.''

15
00:04:23,174 --> 00:04:25,438
''l mean to say one thing...
And say something else.''

16
00:04:25,877 --> 00:04:29,313
''l suffer a strange pain.
What's my poor heart to do.''

17
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,443
''Gazing into your eyes...''

18
00:04:37,355 --> 00:04:39,323
''Even as we talk...''

19
00:04:42,493 --> 00:04:44,859
''One gets...''

20
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:49,562
''And one gives...''

21
00:04:49,934 --> 00:04:51,902
''Love's sweet salute.''

22
00:05:06,184 --> 00:05:08,118
''All day l miss something.''

23
00:05:08,853 --> 00:05:10,718
''l don't know what l desire.''

24
00:05:11,222 --> 00:05:14,680
''l am alone even in a crowd.
What's my poor heart to do.''

25
00:05:16,294 --> 00:05:18,353
''l've forgotten the day,
month and year.''

26
00:05:18,863 --> 00:05:20,831
''l sweat even in January.''

27
00:05:21,365 --> 00:05:25,426
''l find peace nowhere.
What's my poor heart to do.''

28
00:05:28,172 --> 00:05:29,833
''Gazing into your eyes..''

29
00:05:32,977 --> 00:05:35,309
''Even as we talk...''

30
00:05:38,182 --> 00:05:40,776
''One gets...''

31
00:05:43,187 --> 00:05:45,155
''And one gives...''

32
00:05:45,423 --> 00:05:48,722
''Love's sweet salute.''

33
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:35,298
''When l sit, l sit there forever.''

34
00:06:41,178 --> 00:06:47,276
''When l walk, l keep
walking...very far.''

35
00:06:49,854 --> 00:06:51,822
''Restless, l lose all my senses.''

36
00:06:52,323 --> 00:06:54,689
''l smile through tears.''

37
00:06:55,192 --> 00:06:58,787
''Someone stirs half-awake in memory.
What's my poor heart to do.''

38
00:07:01,365 --> 00:07:03,333
''Gazing into your eyes..''

39
00:07:06,304 --> 00:07:08,795
''Even as we talk...''

40
00:07:11,309 --> 00:07:14,244
''One gets...''

41
00:07:16,814 --> 00:07:20,306
''And one gives...
Love's sweet salute.''

42
00:08:55,346 --> 00:08:57,405
Sorry, l'll send the money.

43
00:08:57,715 --> 00:08:59,774
Hey, you are a man in love.
Who's asking for money?

44
00:09:00,284 --> 00:09:02,081
l reached you on time, didn't l?
- Don't know...Perhaps l'm late.

45
00:09:02,286 --> 00:09:04,083
Late? Not to worry, mate.

46
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:07,688
When two people are truly in love,
they'll get together in the end.

47
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,752
Can't find the word...
Even so, all the best.

48
00:09:13,798 --> 00:09:15,095
Strike up!

49
00:09:40,724 --> 00:09:43,284
''Gazing into your eyes...''

50
00:09:45,663 --> 00:09:48,757
''Even as we talk...''

51
00:09:50,901 --> 00:09:53,131
''One gets...''

52
00:09:55,873 --> 00:09:58,137
''And one gives...''

53
00:09:58,476 --> 00:10:01,843
''Love's sweet salute.''

54
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:14,220
''Love's sweet salute.''

55
00:11:27,331 --> 00:11:29,856
We're now a little further
from Madgaon station...

56
00:11:30,334 --> 00:11:32,564
...where this new train
has just been inaugurated.

57
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,737
The Goa Mumbai Holiday Express.
The Railway Ministry says...

58
00:11:36,207 --> 00:11:39,404
lt's not just a train but
a romantic experience.

59
00:11:40,945 --> 00:11:43,573
Everyone here is with
someone they love.

60
00:11:45,349 --> 00:11:47,180
But for those who are alone...

61
00:11:49,253 --> 00:11:51,187
...don't give up hope.

62
00:11:52,923 --> 00:11:57,451
Because on this channel you will be
a part of this romantic journey...

63
00:11:57,795 --> 00:12:01,731
...with Tehzeeb Hussain Raina.

64
00:12:04,335 --> 00:12:05,302
So, let's go.

65
00:12:38,202 --> 00:12:40,568
''lf people want to call me wild...''

66
00:12:41,372 --> 00:12:43,772
''Let them! l don't care.''

67
00:13:22,946 --> 00:13:23,913
Let go...

68
00:13:25,215 --> 00:13:26,182
Why?

69
00:13:26,884 --> 00:13:29,819
l'm feeling very hot.
- That's normal, silly.

70
00:13:30,321 --> 00:13:33,848
Don't you know why?
- Fire... it's raging.

71
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:46,163
You silly, this fire is in the
front side, not at the backside.

72
00:13:46,904 --> 00:13:49,566
lt's at the backside.
- Silly girl, what backside!

73
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:54,676
Father! Fire!

74
00:13:55,012 --> 00:13:55,910
Help!!

75
00:13:57,214 --> 00:14:00,274
''A sonnet of some poet,
O Dream girl...''

76
00:14:00,818 --> 00:14:03,286
''A lotus of beauty. O Dream girl...''

77
00:14:03,854 --> 00:14:08,450
''Somewhere someday l will find her...''

78
00:14:08,826 --> 00:14:11,818
''lf not today, tomorrow.''

79
00:14:16,967 --> 00:14:19,458
Salaam, uncle.
- Salaam to you, son.

80
00:14:19,837 --> 00:14:22,635
Son, come down to earth
from your dreams.

81
00:14:22,973 --> 00:14:25,441
How long will you keep on
dreaming the same dream?

82
00:14:25,743 --> 00:14:28,234
lt's not a dream, uncle.
A fact of future truth.

83
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:31,347
You'll see, uncle.
This door will open one day...

84
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,483
Light will shine all over...

85
00:14:34,852 --> 00:14:37,548
A playful breeze will blow,
bells will ring...

86
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:41,152
Conch blowing auspiciously,
drums rolling...

87
00:14:41,525 --> 00:14:43,857
Celestial dancers will shower flowers

88
00:14:44,361 --> 00:14:47,558
and a white Memsahib will walk
towards me and she will say...

89
00:14:47,931 --> 00:14:50,627
Come, my heart's true love...

90
00:14:51,368 --> 00:14:54,735
Take me to the Taj...

91
00:14:55,205 --> 00:14:57,605
You've gone crazy, Raju.

92
00:14:58,308 --> 00:15:02,802
All your friends have got married.
Even my Ahmed...

93
00:15:03,313 --> 00:15:07,511
whom you dandled on your knee
it's his turn to marry now.

94
00:15:07,918 --> 00:15:09,510
Here.
- Congratulations, uncle.

95
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,812
May Allah bring the day when
l can congratulate you.

96
00:15:14,158 --> 00:15:18,595
Listen to me, son.
Find a nice girl and get married.

97
00:15:19,163 --> 00:15:20,790
Stop living in dreams.

98
00:15:21,265 --> 00:15:23,790
ls a life without dreams worth living?
How can you say that!

99
00:15:24,301 --> 00:15:26,769
O Allah, what'll happen to this boy!

100
00:15:29,206 --> 00:15:33,142
Only what God wills
will come to happen.

101
00:15:59,236 --> 00:16:02,672
Who the hell...?
- Ashu, Tehzeeb is in an accident...

102
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,700
that train...can you hear me?

103
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:21,483
We are a little away from
Sawantwadi junction...

104
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:23,760
...where this terrible
accident took place.

105
00:16:24,161 --> 00:16:26,129
The Goa Mumbai Holiday Express
has been derailed.

106
00:16:26,363 --> 00:16:28,729
This train was inaugurated today.

107
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:32,658
Tehzeeb Hussain Raina, our reporter
was covering the event.

108
00:18:08,532 --> 00:18:10,625
lt's Makkad here, Vinayji.
- Makkad who?

109
00:18:11,201 --> 00:18:15,763
What do you mean? Forgotten me already?
lt's me, Balwinder Singh Makkad.

110
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:22,272
Are you lost or what?

111
00:18:28,885 --> 00:18:30,580
Hey buddy, where's your
mind these days!

112
00:18:30,854 --> 00:18:33,118
Yes, tell me, Makkad Saheb. How
kind of you to think of me.

113
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:38,453
Oh, we think of you day and night.
Don't forget.

114
00:18:38,829 --> 00:18:42,788
You know our Simi is getting married.
Kkamini's dance is must.

115
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,733
Don't worry. We've signed
the contract with Kkamini.

116
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:48,137
Just wait and watch. lt'll
be an explosive act.

117
00:19:03,387 --> 00:19:04,376
Friends...

118
00:19:05,288 --> 00:19:09,088
Tonight is a Special for our Shivu.

119
00:19:18,935 --> 00:19:24,669
When Kkamini came to know
Shivu was getting married...

120
00:19:25,142 --> 00:19:29,101
...Kkamini couldn't stop herself.
She came running...

121
00:19:30,147 --> 00:19:31,444
Everyone said...

122
00:19:31,848 --> 00:19:35,409
Crazy girl, what will you
do at a bachelors' party?

123
00:19:36,286 --> 00:19:39,255
Then Kkamini said...
You fools...

124
00:19:39,823 --> 00:19:42,121
Kkamini is also a bachelor.

125
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:43,926
lsn't she?

126
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:47,727
Hey, isn't she?

127
00:19:54,871 --> 00:19:59,137
On behalf of us all...
we'll miss you.

128
00:20:02,979 --> 00:20:07,143
''Without you, my love...''

129
00:20:09,986 --> 00:20:13,353
''My heart is restless.''

130
00:20:19,863 --> 00:20:22,331
''Every moment is a torment...''

131
00:20:23,366 --> 00:20:27,166
''...for my raging desire.''

132
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:37,169
''Don't go abandoning your lover.''

133
00:20:57,934 --> 00:20:59,765
''Lover O mine...''

134
00:21:00,403 --> 00:21:02,132
''These fair entwining arms... ''

135
00:21:02,405 --> 00:21:04,396
''These, my bangles...''

136
00:21:04,841 --> 00:21:06,502
''My bracelets...''

137
00:21:06,877 --> 00:21:10,677
''They'll haunt your memory,
O my lover.''

138
00:21:11,181 --> 00:21:15,208
''Left to you are but a few moments
of your careless bachelor days.''

139
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:19,285
''Don't go, abandoning your lover.''

140
00:21:19,856 --> 00:21:23,155
''Don't go, abandoning your lover.''

141
00:21:51,321 --> 00:21:53,881
''Lover O mine...''

142
00:21:57,928 --> 00:21:59,555
''These my alluring charms,
this body of mine...''

143
00:21:59,896 --> 00:22:01,420
''These kohl-lined eyes,
darkly beguiling...''

144
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:03,789
''This magic...''

145
00:22:05,335 --> 00:22:07,599
''This intoxication, this addiction...''

146
00:22:08,305 --> 00:22:10,466
''This addiction is sweet sharp pain.''

147
00:22:10,774 --> 00:22:13,334
''Oh, this fragrance!''

148
00:22:13,677 --> 00:22:15,474
''Your alluring charms...''

149
00:22:15,846 --> 00:22:17,473
''Your heady youth...''

150
00:22:18,181 --> 00:22:21,742
''Where will l find them now,
my love-crazy girl!''

151
00:22:23,186 --> 00:22:27,145
''The passionate promise of
this flaming beauty...''

152
00:22:27,858 --> 00:22:30,827
''The dark hair cascading
down these shoulders...''

153
00:22:31,862 --> 00:22:35,628
''Left to you are but a few moments
of your careless bachelor days.''

154
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:39,566
''Don't go, abandoning your lover.''

155
00:22:54,718 --> 00:22:57,551
''Forget these nights.
Now they are gone.''

156
00:22:58,288 --> 00:23:02,349
''All these things are now gone,
listen my love.''

157
00:23:03,426 --> 00:23:06,657
''No more this solace,
be gone my love.''

158
00:23:07,297 --> 00:23:11,131
''No more this love.
A thirsty guest you'll remain.''

159
00:23:11,935 --> 00:23:13,630
''Don't deceive me like this.''

160
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,831
''Don't punish me like this.''

161
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:18,136
''That l may gain some peace...''

162
00:23:18,675 --> 00:23:20,370
''...please offer a prayer.''

163
00:23:21,478 --> 00:23:23,275
''My swaying earrings...''

164
00:23:23,847 --> 00:23:25,542
''My thrusting hip...''

165
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:29,717
''They are not for you anymore.''

166
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,815
''Left to you are but a few moments
of your careless bachelor days.''

167
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:38,284
''Don't go, abandoning your lover.''

168
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:57,211
''No, no, no. Don't go.''

169
00:24:01,351 --> 00:24:05,447
''Don't go, abandoning your lover.''

170
00:24:13,863 --> 00:24:17,321
''Lover O mine... Lover O mine...''

171
00:24:17,834 --> 00:24:20,302
''Don't go, abandoning your lover.''

172
00:24:42,892 --> 00:24:45,554
Why!? Why's everyone after Kkamini?

173
00:24:47,364 --> 00:24:49,298
Because that's what you want.

174
00:24:51,201 --> 00:24:55,228
Babu, are you Kkamini's manager
or of those journos?

175
00:24:55,772 --> 00:24:57,205
Yours, 100%.

176
00:25:02,946 --> 00:25:05,346
What's this?
- Three new item numbers...

177
00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:08,310
Cabaret, nautch-girl number, cabaret.

178
00:25:11,154 --> 00:25:13,122
Dance directors of your choice.

179
00:25:22,298 --> 00:25:25,563
Kkamini is not an ltem Queen.
l want to be a Tragedy Queen.

180
00:25:26,336 --> 00:25:28,736
...like Meena Kumari...

181
00:25:30,373 --> 00:25:31,305
Nargis...

182
00:25:32,675 --> 00:25:33,642
Madhubala..

183
00:25:34,711 --> 00:25:35,678
Madhuri...

184
00:25:36,579 --> 00:25:38,809
Karan Johar...
- Karan Johar?

185
00:25:39,349 --> 00:25:42,546
Why doesn't Karan Johar ever call me?

186
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,684
Because a Karan Johar film needs not
an ltem Girl, a heroine..

187
00:25:48,191 --> 00:25:50,159
..who has no scandals.

188
00:25:50,994 --> 00:25:56,261
She's a simple girl who could be
a daughter, sister, daughter-in-law...

189
00:25:57,333 --> 00:26:02,498
She has one hero, just one hero.
True love...

190
00:26:03,373 --> 00:26:05,102
True and pure.

191
00:26:06,142 --> 00:26:08,303
Oh, that so?
- What?

192
00:26:19,155 --> 00:26:20,281
And Kkamini...

193
00:26:20,924 --> 00:26:22,289
ln ethnic wear...

194
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:24,285
and goggles

195
00:26:26,229 --> 00:26:27,594
Just one photo...

196
00:26:28,331 --> 00:26:30,322
One question.
- ls this true?

197
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:33,795
No, this is a lie!
lt's a plot, a conspiracy!

198
00:26:34,704 --> 00:26:36,763
Kkamini did not go to
any party last night.

199
00:26:37,774 --> 00:26:43,542
Somebody morphed Kkamini's face.
Kkamini doesn't even know how to swim!

200
00:26:47,817 --> 00:26:51,548
The Press has gone mad. You come to
rescue Kkamini but you slip...

201
00:26:53,823 --> 00:26:55,757
You will mention his name.
- Whose?

202
00:26:56,126 --> 00:26:58,492
His!
- His? Whose?

203
00:26:58,862 --> 00:27:02,559
Oh, anybody's!
- Rahul...?

204
00:27:07,203 --> 00:27:09,763
Who is he?
- Who is Rahul?

205
00:27:10,306 --> 00:27:11,273
Tell us.

206
00:27:12,308 --> 00:27:14,105
Who is this Rahul?

207
00:27:15,612 --> 00:27:19,514
Who is this Rahul?
Rahul is Kkamini's very life!

208
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:24,348
Kkamini's whole world...
Rahul is Kkamini's faith.

209
00:27:24,654 --> 00:27:28,112
This means, Kkamini...
- ...is having an affair with Rahul?

210
00:27:28,491 --> 00:27:31,619
NO! Don't call it an affair.

211
00:27:33,163 --> 00:27:34,824
This is love...

212
00:27:35,398 --> 00:27:37,730
Kkamini's true love.

213
00:27:38,968 --> 00:27:42,631
l kept it hidden all this time,
but not anymore. Because...

214
00:27:42,972 --> 00:27:47,136
Why fear when you love.
Why heave sighs in silence.

215
00:27:55,285 --> 00:27:57,378
Do you know what you're doing?

216
00:27:59,122 --> 00:28:03,320
Kkamini knows everything.
Kkamini is not a fool.

217
00:28:15,905 --> 00:28:17,532
Sir, l'm Dotcom Paaji.

218
00:28:25,748 --> 00:28:28,342
Don't you worry about the plan,
my princely bridegroom.

219
00:28:29,786 --> 00:28:33,415
Nothing to worry, sir. Get into the car
and we'll go straight to Udaipur.

220
00:28:33,756 --> 00:28:38,557
Why Udaipur? We told you to finalise
the match with Colonel Bakshi of Delhi.

221
00:28:38,861 --> 00:28:41,830
Forget it. l'll show you better stuff.
- One minute...

222
00:28:42,332 --> 00:28:46,735
What can be better than Col. Bakshi?
Good family, rich, first class Punjabi.

223
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:51,766
You're correct, sir. Col. Bakshi agreed
but it's his daughter who's to marry.

224
00:28:52,175 --> 00:28:55,406
She expired.
- There! Your marriage is jinxed.

225
00:28:55,778 --> 00:28:58,406
Getting into a flap again ! She expired.
- No sir, what l meant...

226
00:28:58,715 --> 00:29:01,149
He was in a flap, all
the way from Canada...

227
00:29:01,484 --> 00:29:04,681
You're right, sir. But l didn't
say the girl had expired...

228
00:29:05,121 --> 00:29:07,521
l meant, her wedding date had expired.

229
00:29:07,857 --> 00:29:11,293
Some guy had in his tender earlier
and the girl opened it herself.

230
00:29:12,262 --> 00:29:15,197
Oh, this messes up the whole deal!
- Makes no difference.

231
00:29:15,531 --> 00:29:18,091
We'll open our tender somewhere else.
ls there any shortage of girls here!

232
00:29:18,434 --> 00:29:20,800
No shortage... l will see
to it you get married this time.

233
00:29:21,304 --> 00:29:23,704
Sir, wait here. l'll be back
in a couple of minutes.

234
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,234
Here l go.. Here l go..

235
00:29:28,311 --> 00:29:30,279
ls he arranging a marriage
or fixing a deal?

236
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,614
For your son, it's his marriage.

237
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:37,442
But for him it's a deal, right?
- Mom says...

238
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,584
l've heard what she has to say
for 30 long years! Go sit in the car.

239
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:43,290
But this is a taxi...
- Get in. Want a slap in public?

240
00:29:49,165 --> 00:29:51,133
Yes...Tell me.

241
00:29:52,302 --> 00:29:53,326
Tell what?

242
00:29:55,371 --> 00:29:57,134
Say, destination, sir.

243
00:29:58,941 --> 00:29:59,908
Destination...

244
00:30:01,811 --> 00:30:06,839
Where do you want to go, your lordship?
- Ok...all right. Deal. So tell me.

245
00:30:09,852 --> 00:30:11,820
What am l to tell you?
- Where we are to go.

246
00:30:12,822 --> 00:30:15,552
Why'll l tell you that!
- Why won't you? The Sardarji said...

247
00:30:15,858 --> 00:30:18,656
You're the one who's travelling.
lf the Sardarji told you...

248
00:30:18,961 --> 00:30:22,863
then go ask him! Why ask me!
- Hang on. Don't get angry. He's right.

249
00:30:23,366 --> 00:30:26,767
Let's ask the Sardarji.
So tell me.

250
00:30:27,904 --> 00:30:30,600
Tell you what now!
- Where's the Sardarji?

251
00:30:30,907 --> 00:30:33,842
Tell us that at least.
- Don't chew up my brain !

252
00:30:34,344 --> 00:30:38,508
Get down from my car!
He's your Sardarji. So you go find him.

253
00:30:38,815 --> 00:30:42,581
Thief! Thief!! Thief! Thief!!

254
00:30:43,219 --> 00:30:47,622
Thief? Then tell the police. A Sardar
has given me enough tension already.

255
00:30:47,957 --> 00:30:51,893
You solve your tension in jail!
You don't know who l am.

256
00:30:52,395 --> 00:30:54,590
l'm Dotcom Paaji!

257
00:30:54,964 --> 00:30:58,400
People steal luggage. This guy steals
passengers wholesale! You thief! Cheat!

258
00:31:03,973 --> 00:31:05,600
To the police station ! All of you.

259
00:31:07,343 --> 00:31:09,538
You've kids, Sahebji?
- Yes. You'll give them candy?

260
00:31:09,846 --> 00:31:12,144
How did you know? Are
you an astrologer?

261
00:31:13,983 --> 00:31:17,578
How do l say it...can't find the word
... Pollution everywhere.

262
00:31:26,195 --> 00:31:28,163
l'll be there in 5 minutes.
- So early!?

263
00:31:28,598 --> 00:31:30,566
You're merely four and
half hours late.

264
00:31:34,203 --> 00:31:35,830
What should l say? l'm a changed man.

265
00:31:36,205 --> 00:31:38,264
Yes...lt's all in the papers,
how you've changed.

266
00:31:40,843 --> 00:31:42,708
But after the wedding you're gonna be
just my boy.

267
00:31:42,979 --> 00:31:46,506
Am l crazy? Will l dare take
on a Col. Bakshi daughter?

268
00:31:46,816 --> 00:31:48,784
The entire lndian army
will be after me!

269
00:31:49,218 --> 00:31:51,186
So the wedding is on because
you're afraid of Papa?

270
00:31:51,754 --> 00:31:53,745
Can't you take a joke?

271
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:56,815
Then why are you getting married?
- Because you said so.

272
00:31:57,326 --> 00:31:59,123
What if l hadn't asked?

273
00:32:02,899 --> 00:32:05,527
Shiven, what if l hadn't asked?

274
00:32:09,906 --> 00:32:11,601
l'll be there in 3 minutes.

275
00:32:18,981 --> 00:32:20,278
You say it too.

276
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:22,414
Actually, Juggy is with me...

277
00:32:23,352 --> 00:32:26,150
What's he doing there? You always
said he's such a bore...

278
00:32:29,792 --> 00:32:31,350
l'm there already.

279
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:35,727
l don't believe this, buddy.
You're getting married!

280
00:32:36,199 --> 00:32:38,167
Why, you got the card, didn't you?

281
00:32:39,602 --> 00:32:42,162
But seriously, your life
is going to change, buddy

282
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:48,174
There will be only Gia in your life
and you will be... Gia's hubby deah !

283
00:32:49,212 --> 00:32:52,181
All the time, asleep or awake,
there'll be only one name, Gia...

284
00:32:52,548 --> 00:32:54,743
And for her, Gia's hubby deah !

285
00:33:07,363 --> 00:33:09,126
And then, the kids...

286
00:33:15,938 --> 00:33:20,307
With her, the grinning husband,
Gia's hubby deah !

287
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,803
l can see the whole tree before me...

288
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,482
And with her, Gia's hubby deah !

289
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:53,175
Marry...

290
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:56,303
l don't want to be Gia's hubby deah !

291
00:33:58,948 --> 00:34:03,282
Thank you.
- Me? But... what did l do?

292
00:34:03,953 --> 00:34:06,513
You saved me...

293
00:34:10,826 --> 00:34:13,124
Nobody in our family has
got married to this day.

294
00:34:14,163 --> 00:34:15,130
But you...?

295
00:34:18,701 --> 00:34:22,694
You don't understand, Juggy.
We are all ill-fated...

296
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,430
Look at that...

297
00:34:27,843 --> 00:34:30,607
She was in my arms the other day.
Now l'm to be Gia's hubby deah?

298
00:34:33,182 --> 00:34:34,672
This is love.

299
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:37,716
Kkamini's true love.

300
00:34:38,354 --> 00:34:39,821
ls Rahul a lie...
- or the truth...

301
00:34:40,189 --> 00:34:42,157
We have to find out!
- But we have little time...

302
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:45,723
Because ls Kkamini going to London...
- with Rahul.

303
00:34:46,195 --> 00:34:48,561
Or without Rahul.
- LET'S FlND OUT...

304
00:34:48,864 --> 00:34:51,162
THE TRUTH ABOUT THE lTEM BOMB.

305
00:34:56,272 --> 00:34:58,433
Are you going to London for
a show or to meet Rahul?

306
00:34:58,808 --> 00:35:02,710
Does Rahul live in London?
- Rahul who? Gandhi or Bajaj?

307
00:35:04,347 --> 00:35:08,613
Look, l have already said this
is Kkamini's personal life.

308
00:35:13,789 --> 00:35:16,417
What's all this? lt puts me
under tension.

309
00:35:19,328 --> 00:35:22,820
You must always stay relaxed
under tension, right?

310
00:35:23,933 --> 00:35:28,131
This is only the beginning.
Just wait and watch.

311
00:35:33,275 --> 00:35:37,439
Aren't the seats together, Babu?
- l had them reserved together.

312
00:35:37,913 --> 00:35:38,811
Together.

313
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:42,309
You are with Mr. Rahul and
he is right behind you.

314
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,483
Mr. Rahul... who?

315
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:51,155
Rahul who?

316
00:35:51,827 --> 00:35:53,818
Mr. Rahul, your...
- My...?

317
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:57,390
Ma'am, your childhood...

318
00:36:45,181 --> 00:36:48,150
ls there any privacy
in a public place?

319
00:36:52,988 --> 00:36:55,149
Openly and boldly we'll show our love.

320
00:36:58,794 --> 00:37:02,252
But how long can we keep it hidden?
So many questions...

321
00:37:02,698 --> 00:37:06,600
Lies...allegations...
And you, all alone...

322
00:37:07,136 --> 00:37:12,335
How long will you answer these cruel,
heartless journalists of this industry?

323
00:37:13,476 --> 00:37:17,105
Truth had to come out someday.
l have come...

324
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,780
your Raooul...

325
00:37:20,316 --> 00:37:22,784
Actually, Rahul who
belongs to you all.

326
00:37:24,487 --> 00:37:28,787
Life is a game.
Some pass some fail.

327
00:37:29,325 --> 00:37:33,625
Could be a naive loser.
Or a skilled gamester.

328
00:37:34,163 --> 00:37:36,358
Do you get it, dear sir?

329
00:38:08,297 --> 00:38:10,561
Vinay, l think it's your
birthday today...

330
00:38:10,866 --> 00:38:12,834
And everyone is waiting
downstairs for...

331
00:38:14,136 --> 00:38:15,433
What're you doing?

332
00:38:15,638 --> 00:38:19,870
Nothing...Just getting ready
for my 40th birthday party.

333
00:38:20,342 --> 00:38:22,242
You aren't even dressed yet!

334
00:38:23,879 --> 00:38:26,677
Pappu uncle sent mail. Email him.
- Yes.

335
00:38:27,149 --> 00:38:29,515
Dad's elder brother and sister called.
Call them back.

336
00:38:29,819 --> 00:38:31,684
Yes.
- Call at 2. lt'll be 7 there.

337
00:38:32,154 --> 00:38:33,746
Yes.
- Am l putting on weight?

338
00:38:34,156 --> 00:38:35,521
Yes.
- Yes...!?

339
00:38:40,162 --> 00:38:43,495
lt's just that Malini said...
Am l looking rather healthy?

340
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:45,629
Has Malini ever seen herself
in the mirror?

341
00:38:47,169 --> 00:38:50,138
Kick up a storm!
A storm! A storm!

342
00:39:08,457 --> 00:39:09,481
Pappu uncle sent mail.

343
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,291
Call at 2. lt'll be 7 there.

344
00:39:14,263 --> 00:39:16,094
Am l putting on weight?

345
00:39:27,309 --> 00:39:29,334
Listen. You are all coming,
aren't you?

346
00:39:29,678 --> 00:39:32,374
Yes, we are coming.
- Seema said there was some show...

347
00:39:32,681 --> 00:39:35,514
Don't come too late.
- Yes, Kkamini's show...

348
00:39:40,289 --> 00:39:43,452
Listen, come soon.
We miss you all very much.

349
00:39:43,826 --> 00:39:46,454
That Dungarpur cur ran away!

350
00:39:46,829 --> 00:39:48,729
Dad, you just jabber away....

351
00:39:49,164 --> 00:39:50,756
Give me the phone.

352
00:39:51,967 --> 00:39:54,527
Yes sir?
- Happy birthday, son.

353
00:39:56,839 --> 00:40:00,138
That Dungarpur guy has gone missing!

354
00:40:00,409 --> 00:40:03,242
But don't get your tickets refunded.

355
00:40:03,612 --> 00:40:05,842
There's a very good NRl match
in the pipeline.

356
00:40:06,348 --> 00:40:08,145
Dad, give me the phone!

357
00:40:10,185 --> 00:40:11,812
Don't listen to Dad.

358
00:40:12,321 --> 00:40:14,289
What happened?
- Seema, just a sec...

359
00:40:15,391 --> 00:40:18,827
Your mother's call.
Daddy said Shiven ran away.

360
00:40:21,864 --> 00:40:23,798
Gia, what's happening?
- Nothing at all...

361
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,165
Shiven was to come to lunch today...

362
00:40:26,468 --> 00:40:28,834
but he didn't.
So Dad is kicking up a ruckus.

363
00:40:29,872 --> 00:40:31,703
Gia, give Dad the phone.

364
00:40:32,007 --> 00:40:35,602
Sis, don't you start now!
l'll handle Shiven.

365
00:40:35,911 --> 00:40:38,573
Anyways l ought to be miffed!

366
00:40:39,214 --> 00:40:40,943
You aren't coming to
the pre-wedding do!

367
00:40:41,917 --> 00:40:45,751
What can l do, Gia.
He has a big event here, with Kkamini.

368
00:40:47,756 --> 00:40:49,656
You'd better watch Bro-in-law then !

369
00:41:36,905 --> 00:41:39,203
Where's Tehzeeb?
- l don't know!

370
00:43:07,896 --> 00:43:10,364
Are you really sure?
- Yes...

371
00:43:14,837 --> 00:43:16,634
This is not my Tehzeeb...

372
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:21,604
...not my Tehzeeb.

373
00:43:22,177 --> 00:43:24,145
Doctor, they've found injured
survivors in the next village.

374
00:44:36,718 --> 00:44:40,154
''Somewhere someday l will find her...''

375
00:44:40,856 --> 00:44:42,824
''lf not today, tomorrow...''

376
00:44:47,429 --> 00:44:48,828
Please come in. Treat this
as your own house.

377
00:44:49,198 --> 00:44:51,598
What to do!
- Come on ! At a time like this...

378
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,834
who else but a neighbour is of help!
- Ruined our honour!

379
00:44:54,236 --> 00:44:55,203
C'mon

380
00:45:25,834 --> 00:45:27,563
What're you doing, Juggy?

381
00:45:53,929 --> 00:45:57,558
Are you making fun of me?
l'll strangle you !

382
00:46:02,404 --> 00:46:04,770
Drunk eh, deah chap?
- l'll break your jaw!

383
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,800
No! l didn't mean that deah !

384
00:46:21,857 --> 00:46:24,587
Why don't you do something, Juggy!

385
00:46:26,161 --> 00:46:27,526
What can l do?

386
00:46:35,871 --> 00:46:38,567
l will refuse.
- Refuse to marry...?

387
00:46:38,874 --> 00:46:42,742
You go tell her.
- How can l go and tell her?

388
00:46:57,759 --> 00:47:00,319
l'll speak. And record it.

389
00:47:00,829 --> 00:47:04,663
l'll do everything. All you have
to do is give her the disc.

390
00:47:05,367 --> 00:47:07,335
How can l...?
- You can't say no now.

391
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:10,104
You can't say no, buddy.

392
00:47:24,252 --> 00:47:26,345
ls it on?
- l can't do this.

393
00:47:26,655 --> 00:47:28,782
lt's a question of my life.

394
00:47:39,234 --> 00:47:41,134
l can't get married!

395
00:47:53,181 --> 00:47:57,083
Listen, marriage won't
cause me any harm...

396
00:47:58,186 --> 00:48:00,347
But you will be ruined!

397
00:48:00,922 --> 00:48:06,792
You'll become fat.
Every woman does. Right, Juggy?

398
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:10,593
Look at your Mom.

399
00:48:11,233 --> 00:48:14,259
And l'll be screaming
at you all the time.

400
00:48:16,671 --> 00:48:19,572
l'll go mad.
Do you want that?

401
00:48:22,144 --> 00:48:23,805
Look at your Dad.

402
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:30,675
This is for your happiness...
- Don't do this, buddy.

403
00:48:31,153 --> 00:48:33,713
lf Gia ever comes to know, she'll
really call off the wedding.

404
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:37,518
ls it possible for it to happen?
- What to happen?

405
00:48:37,959 --> 00:48:40,359
That Gia calls it off, not me?

406
00:48:40,962 --> 00:48:43,692
lf your stupidity continues...
Then yes.

407
00:48:51,273 --> 00:48:55,141
What did l do now?
- You didn't do anything...

408
00:48:59,781 --> 00:49:01,214
But now you will.

409
00:49:01,817 --> 00:49:06,686
l will do it! Definitely today.
l won't let it go.

410
00:49:51,833 --> 00:49:53,130
Fatty!

411
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,847
l won't let you go.

412
00:50:26,201 --> 00:50:27,168
Kids...

413
00:50:28,203 --> 00:50:29,568
What is it?

414
00:50:29,871 --> 00:50:31,600
Five kids...

415
00:50:31,907 --> 00:50:34,705
Have patience...one by one,
you'll have them all.

416
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:37,474
Right now...

417
00:50:39,014 --> 00:50:42,848
Don't you know even that, you silly?
For 5, it'll take 5 years.

418
00:50:43,919 --> 00:50:47,320
Why'll it take so long?
They're right behind you.

419
00:50:48,223 --> 00:50:49,190
Behind...?

420
00:50:51,226 --> 00:50:52,193
Behind.

421
00:50:58,700 --> 00:50:59,826
Who the hell...?

422
00:51:02,837 --> 00:51:06,796
How come, Guru?
The same dream day and night.

423
00:51:07,342 --> 00:51:09,674
But she never comes, my Dree...

424
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:15,547
Guru will give the sign...

425
00:51:16,851 --> 00:51:17,818
Signal...

426
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,480
The day the Dream girl
is to arrive...

427
00:51:23,858 --> 00:51:25,826
Light will shine all over...

428
00:51:30,365 --> 00:51:32,765
A playful breeze will blow..

429
00:51:35,203 --> 00:51:37,467
Bells will ring...

430
00:51:43,878 --> 00:51:45,505
Auspicious conch blown...

431
00:51:47,215 --> 00:51:48,512
Drums rolling...

432
00:51:50,452 --> 00:51:52,511
The sky will shower flowers...

433
00:51:57,425 --> 00:51:59,586
The gates of heaven will open...

434
00:52:06,868 --> 00:52:12,272
Celestial dancers will
hover in attendance...

435
00:52:14,909 --> 00:52:16,843
From their midst, the
Dream girl will emerge

436
00:52:22,851 --> 00:52:24,546
Then she'll say...

437
00:52:38,199 --> 00:52:45,162
An emperor built the beautiful
Taj Mahal...

438
00:52:48,877 --> 00:52:53,337
And gave the whole world...

439
00:52:53,948 --> 00:52:57,281
...this symbol of love.

440
00:52:57,886 --> 00:53:01,447
Madam, welcome to Taj...

441
00:53:06,961 --> 00:53:08,826
Taj...
You tell Taj...

442
00:53:21,176 --> 00:53:22,143
Which hotel?

443
00:53:24,846 --> 00:53:26,677
Big mistake! Hotel Taj...?

444
00:53:28,316 --> 00:53:30,147
No police!

445
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,312
Please listen, madam!

446
00:53:58,847 --> 00:54:00,280
Very far...

447
00:54:01,149 --> 00:54:03,549
For the love of God!
What are you doing?

448
00:54:07,956 --> 00:54:10,516
No! No one here. Only Raju here!

449
00:54:14,262 --> 00:54:16,127
l'll put it back together...

450
00:54:25,306 --> 00:54:27,740
Where're you going?
with strangers? Not good!

451
00:54:28,209 --> 00:54:30,143
Your permit?
- Don't have permit, brother.

452
00:54:56,137 --> 00:54:58,105
l had to give her this...

453
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,671
That's what everyone says.

454
00:55:07,415 --> 00:55:11,112
Careful, dear sir! Watch your step.

455
00:55:41,883 --> 00:55:44,317
''Watch your step, dear sir.''

456
00:55:44,919 --> 00:55:48,582
''Be careful in love.''

457
00:55:49,991 --> 00:55:53,518
''Yes, there are so many dangers...''

458
00:55:53,862 --> 00:55:57,093
''There are so many dangers
in the path of love.''

459
00:56:36,504 --> 00:56:40,304
''Why are you looking lost,
your head hanging down?''

460
00:56:41,175 --> 00:56:44,736
''You walk away as if you've
lost everything.''

461
00:56:45,446 --> 00:56:49,143
''This is just the first
step, dear sir...''

462
00:56:49,851 --> 00:56:53,309
''Your very own seem uncaring
like strangers.''

463
00:56:55,189 --> 00:56:58,590
''Yes, there are so many dangers...''

464
00:56:59,127 --> 00:57:02,096
''There are so many dangers
in the path of love.''

465
00:57:39,267 --> 00:57:43,135
''lf you have fallen
out with someone...''

466
00:57:43,905 --> 00:57:47,466
''Then clasp the hand of another.''

467
00:57:48,209 --> 00:57:52,305
''Strange are the ways of this life.''

468
00:57:52,847 --> 00:57:56,214
''lf alone, you have a million foes.''

469
00:57:58,119 --> 00:58:01,247
''Yes, there are so many dangers...''

470
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:04,258
''There are so many dangers
in the path of love.''

471
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:11,492
''Watch your step, dear sir.''

472
00:59:03,651 --> 00:59:05,619
This... l think this...

473
00:59:07,789 --> 00:59:09,757
l thought l had lost it forever.

474
00:59:10,224 --> 00:59:12,089
l don't know how to...

475
01:00:04,212 --> 01:00:05,179
You !

476
01:00:07,882 --> 01:00:09,213
What are you doing here?

477
01:00:09,517 --> 01:00:12,418
Malini said Bollywood dancing
is best for exercise.

478
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,449
That's full...

479
01:00:15,323 --> 01:00:17,257
l know. He told me just now.

480
01:00:20,361 --> 01:00:23,592
Are you feeling all right?
- What'll happen to me?

481
01:00:23,931 --> 01:00:25,922
lt happens...it always happens
this way the first time.

482
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,493
That's how the class is.
- That's how the class is.

483
01:00:29,704 --> 01:00:32,502
Kkamini's show, you know...
Mr. Makkad's daughter's wedding.

484
01:00:40,214 --> 01:00:43,581
lt's full now. Want to see
Bollywood dancing for next term, lady?

485
01:00:46,854 --> 01:00:48,719
l'm very hungry.

486
01:00:49,223 --> 01:00:51,191
lt's been so long since
we had lunch together.

487
01:00:51,392 --> 01:00:53,724
l've to pick up Rohan and Shai
from school.

488
01:00:54,028 --> 01:00:56,519
l'll go along.
We'll lunch together.

489
01:00:58,199 --> 01:00:59,757
Listen...
- What happened?

490
01:01:00,234 --> 01:01:01,792
You better keep your distance
from Kkamini.

491
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:04,297
Malini said she's a maneater!

492
01:01:05,907 --> 01:01:08,375
What nonsense!
Who's he to follow us like this?

493
01:01:16,284 --> 01:01:18,149
You shouldn't walk so
fast at your age.

494
01:01:20,188 --> 01:01:21,655
Tip the Bell Gramps.

495
01:01:24,192 --> 01:01:25,819
Not rupees, pounds.
- Pounds?

496
01:01:26,194 --> 01:01:27,821
All. All.

497
01:01:42,343 --> 01:01:43,867
Who is this, Babu?

498
01:01:46,347 --> 01:01:48,611
Who on earth are you?

499
01:01:49,217 --> 01:01:53,517
Rahul...Kkamini's childhood
sweetheart.

500
01:01:54,222 --> 01:01:55,621
Baby, he's your childhood...

501
01:01:55,856 --> 01:01:58,848
He doesn't know Kkamini!
l'll call the police right away.

502
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:01,123
The truth about Rahul will come out.

503
01:02:01,462 --> 01:02:03,555
And Kkamini's lie will be caught.
- Never!

504
01:02:03,864 --> 01:02:06,230
No, Kkamini, no!

505
01:02:09,837 --> 01:02:11,771
Work with Karan?
Be on 'Koffee with Karan'?

506
01:02:12,173 --> 01:02:14,471
You take care of Karan,
l'll handle this guy.

507
01:02:18,179 --> 01:02:22,377
Well, what's it that you want?
Who are you?

508
01:02:23,417 --> 01:02:26,147
You're not Rahul. We all know it.

509
01:02:26,654 --> 01:02:28,679
She knows l am not Rahul.

510
01:02:29,857 --> 01:02:31,586
You know l am not Rahul.

511
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,528
l know l am not Raooul.

512
01:02:34,996 --> 01:02:38,454
But...do these people
know l am not Rahul?

513
01:02:47,441 --> 01:02:49,602
Kkamini, look who's at our door!

514
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:52,743
The world famous journalist duo...
Amar-Prem

515
01:02:53,214 --> 01:02:54,738
Famous?
- Oh yes.

516
01:02:55,216 --> 01:02:57,116
l've seen so many of your shows.

517
01:02:59,153 --> 01:03:00,120
Bell Gramps...

518
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:09,819
You kept my bags here along with
Kkamini's luggage. My room no. is 309.

519
01:03:11,165 --> 01:03:12,757
lt's okay.

520
01:03:13,834 --> 01:03:16,132
He thinks l'm staying with Kkamini.

521
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:18,702
You're not staying together?

522
01:03:19,173 --> 01:03:23,405
ln our culture, before marriage
... no chance.

523
01:03:23,911 --> 01:03:25,879
Do you guys stay together?

524
01:03:26,414 --> 01:03:28,382
We... no!

525
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:30,849
lt was a pleasure meeting you.

526
01:03:31,352 --> 01:03:32,319
Me too.

527
01:03:33,354 --> 01:03:35,845
By the way, you two can stay together,
you know.

528
01:03:44,265 --> 01:03:46,165
Come, let's get down
to some real talk.

529
01:03:47,335 --> 01:03:49,166
Who am l?
- Who?

530
01:03:49,904 --> 01:03:54,273
Don !
l mean, the hero of this film.

531
01:03:55,209 --> 01:03:59,111
Look, whether you agree or not,
your audience agrees.

532
01:04:06,921 --> 01:04:08,786
l don't want to hear it!

533
01:04:10,391 --> 01:04:13,417
So don't hear...Just think...

534
01:04:24,438 --> 01:04:25,803
Two hearts are falling in love.

535
01:04:26,407 --> 01:04:28,307
But slowly, silently.

536
01:04:30,177 --> 01:04:31,542
Love and Passion.

537
01:04:34,882 --> 01:04:36,144
Eternal Love.

538
01:04:36,851 --> 01:04:37,818
Page 3.

539
01:04:38,519 --> 01:04:40,146
Kkamini's grand show...

540
01:04:41,188 --> 01:04:42,621
And with Kkamini, Rahul!

541
01:04:46,193 --> 01:04:48,286
Kkamini's image has changed.

542
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:55,162
And then...then...

543
01:04:57,505 --> 01:04:58,494
Then?

544
01:05:10,351 --> 01:05:13,115
l'm Karan Johar speaking.
ls Ms. Kkamini there?

545
01:05:13,454 --> 01:05:17,288
Yes, l am! l'm here!
l am here for you !

546
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:25,355
What do you want in return?

547
01:05:27,902 --> 01:05:29,870
Nothing...
To be with you, for a moment or two.

548
01:05:30,304 --> 01:05:33,137
Not physical, not emotional.
Only a moment or two.

549
01:05:35,843 --> 01:05:37,811
You can't believe it, do you?
ln that case, 10 million.

550
01:05:38,412 --> 01:05:41,313
Babu, just throw him out!

551
01:05:43,284 --> 01:05:45,309
Babu, why don't you do something?

552
01:05:47,354 --> 01:05:49,845
Have you gone mad?
- Yes, l had gone mad!

553
01:05:50,357 --> 01:05:53,485
l was mad the day l listened
to your plan.

554
01:05:55,463 --> 01:05:56,430
Sensational news!

555
01:06:04,138 --> 01:06:07,505
Look. You want 10 million? Given.

556
01:06:08,809 --> 01:06:09,798
No tricks.
- Never.

557
01:06:10,311 --> 01:06:13,747
Work done, cash down.
Then you disappear!

558
01:06:13,814 --> 01:06:14,781
Of course.

559
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:32,390
Oh yes, l haven't forgotten
the relatives who have yet to come...

560
01:06:32,833 --> 01:06:35,393
... and those already here.
Auntyji..!

561
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:43,367
Hold on to him... tight!

562
01:06:46,313 --> 01:06:48,144
What's going on, Shiven?

563
01:06:50,417 --> 01:06:52,715
Lunch was the other day, not today.

564
01:06:53,621 --> 01:06:57,489
Where had you disappeared to?
- l'm sorry l am late, Papa.

565
01:06:58,792 --> 01:07:00,851
You're late by two
full days, Shiven !

566
01:07:03,931 --> 01:07:06,161
Sorry, l was stuck at work.
- Work!

567
01:07:06,667 --> 01:07:08,430
When do you ever work anyways?

568
01:07:14,808 --> 01:07:17,106
l'm very scared, buddy.
- Who gave you this number?

569
01:07:19,179 --> 01:07:21,113
Don't ever phone again !

570
01:07:23,684 --> 01:07:26,380
Papa, she says l'm the father
of the baby she's expecting.

571
01:07:34,161 --> 01:07:36,129
Last time too when l was
about to get married...

572
01:07:37,831 --> 01:07:41,323
You were to get married earlier too?
- Oh, didn't l tell you?

573
01:07:42,169 --> 01:07:44,137
Sorry, l forgot.

574
01:07:44,872 --> 01:07:48,467
l'm going to have your baby.
- She's here!

575
01:07:48,842 --> 01:07:52,710
This is a last warning, got it?
l'll report you to the police!

576
01:07:56,183 --> 01:07:58,515
l will report to the police now.

577
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:02,753
Let's go, Gia. The
wedding's cancelled.

578
01:08:05,125 --> 01:08:08,390
You heard it right,
Shiven Dungarpur!

579
01:08:08,796 --> 01:08:11,287
l didn't hear it at all, Papa.
Will you say it louder?

580
01:08:13,133 --> 01:08:15,260
Shiven Dungarpur!

581
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:49,232
l'm handling it!
Didn't l tell you to...?

582
01:08:55,209 --> 01:08:58,144
Shiven Dungarpur!
l'm going to have your baby.

583
01:08:58,445 --> 01:09:00,504
Your sin is growing in my womb!

584
01:09:00,814 --> 01:09:03,180
But l don't want even your
dirty shadow to fall on my baby!

585
01:09:03,517 --> 01:09:06,077
This baby doesn't need
his father's name.

586
01:09:06,787 --> 01:09:08,414
Ask me why.
Ask me why!

587
01:09:08,789 --> 01:09:13,226
- Why?
- Because he'll have his mother!

588
01:09:23,771 --> 01:09:25,102
Joke!

589
01:09:26,206 --> 01:09:27,173
Joke!

590
01:09:29,143 --> 01:09:31,304
lt was all a joke!

591
01:09:42,389 --> 01:09:47,292
ls everything recorded? Everything?
What a wonderful job, man !

592
01:09:57,905 --> 01:10:00,669
Hold on to him... tight!

593
01:10:32,005 --> 01:10:33,632
How are you?

594
01:10:36,944 --> 01:10:40,277
Liar!
Afraid, weren't you?

595
01:10:42,783 --> 01:10:44,478
You must have thought...

596
01:10:54,027 --> 01:10:56,120
What'll you do if something
happens to me?

597
01:11:00,167 --> 01:11:02,431
Find somebody...
- What?

598
01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:07,766
lf something happens to me, find
a nice, sensible girl and marry her.

599
01:11:08,709 --> 01:11:12,145
Has your fever gone up again?
Shall l call the doctor?

600
01:11:12,913 --> 01:11:14,744
You talk such utter nonsense!

601
01:11:15,516 --> 01:11:18,576
l'm not joking. l mean it.
- What?

602
01:11:20,187 --> 01:11:23,156
Find a nice sensible girl...

603
01:11:29,196 --> 01:11:32,165
What do you mean okay?
- Okay means okay.

604
01:11:34,501 --> 01:11:38,801
Will you really find somebody else?
- That's what you told me to.

605
01:11:42,342 --> 01:11:43,775
How is she?

606
01:11:44,945 --> 01:11:46,640
How is she?
- Who?

607
01:11:47,214 --> 01:11:50,581
That one you'll marry
after l am gone... is she pretty?

608
01:11:50,884 --> 01:11:53,182
Yes. So what?
- Prettier than me?

609
01:11:55,455 --> 01:11:58,481
Listen, Mr. Different!
Stop dreaming.

610
01:11:58,859 --> 01:12:01,760
Nobody else will come
into your life. You know why?

611
01:12:02,329 --> 01:12:04,320
Because l'm not going anywhere!

612
01:12:07,868 --> 01:12:09,597
Are you leaving?

613
01:12:18,579 --> 01:12:20,137
Hear me?

614
01:12:21,281 --> 01:12:23,749
l am never going to leave you.

615
01:12:28,488 --> 01:12:30,718
l'm never going to leave you.

616
01:12:32,893 --> 01:12:37,762
Hear me?
l'm never going to leave you.

617
01:13:13,834 --> 01:13:16,598
This is exactly what l
don't like about you.

618
01:13:18,171 --> 01:13:22,699
You had me all stirred up,
and you calmly watch the fun.

619
01:13:24,177 --> 01:13:25,838
Taj...Taj...

620
01:13:29,182 --> 01:13:31,616
Who was to give me the sign
for the hotel, O lord?

621
01:13:33,186 --> 01:13:35,814
Why are you just looking on !
Go and rescue her.

622
01:13:36,890 --> 01:13:38,482
Find her. Fi...nd...

623
01:14:01,248 --> 01:14:02,613
You are crying?

624
01:14:04,151 --> 01:14:07,712
You should be partying!
Have a party! They took your stuff..

625
01:14:08,155 --> 01:14:10,783
but left you alone, didn't they?
Does it ever happen? No, never!

626
01:14:11,224 --> 01:14:14,421
lf they had molested...
l can't find the word.

627
01:14:14,828 --> 01:14:18,127
lt was my Guru who saved you.
Yes, he saved you.

628
01:14:44,224 --> 01:14:46,158
l've seen him...

629
01:14:50,197 --> 01:14:52,358
He... who?

630
01:14:54,201 --> 01:14:55,259
Your brother?

631
01:15:01,808 --> 01:15:03,605
Nooooooo!

632
01:15:26,833 --> 01:15:30,394
l can't tell you where Paaji and
Mr. Chaddha went. lt's a trade secret.

633
01:15:30,904 --> 01:15:32,166
Sure?
- Sure.

634
01:15:32,472 --> 01:15:33,837
Sure?
- Sure.

635
01:15:40,347 --> 01:15:43,145
You...out...going.
You...out...going for two minutes.

636
01:15:43,483 --> 01:15:45,144
You...out...going.

637
01:15:46,486 --> 01:15:47,453
Sure?

638
01:16:02,302 --> 01:16:05,100
You...inside...coming. Come in.

639
01:16:06,173 --> 01:16:08,107
Laugh ! Then spit out the info.

640
01:16:10,143 --> 01:16:13,442
Dotcom Paaji went first to Udaipur
with the Chadha family.

641
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:17,509
This is the address.
lf the deal doesn't work out..

642
01:16:17,818 --> 01:16:20,753
..on then to Rishikesh...
Address no.2.

643
01:16:21,788 --> 01:16:25,315
And then Jammu.
Address no.3.

644
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,755
What are you doing?
- l am taking you on a drive.

645
01:16:29,229 --> 01:16:31,129
Let go. Someone will see.

646
01:16:31,631 --> 01:16:35,533
You silly, who'll see what?
Even l've seen nothing till now.

647
01:16:35,836 --> 01:16:38,828
Phoolwati, let me go
Cock-a-doodle doo!

648
01:16:51,184 --> 01:16:52,651
How does it feel?

649
01:16:52,953 --> 01:16:55,478
l feel as if the whole
world is spinning.

650
01:16:55,789 --> 01:16:57,757
Yeah...it'll spin...and rock...

651
01:16:58,558 --> 01:17:01,391
My stupid son burned
down the house.

652
01:17:02,596 --> 01:17:06,498
But you are so generous, O Lord.
You gave us a new house.

653
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:10,269
Let no calamity befall
this house now.

654
01:17:11,838 --> 01:17:13,635
l feel as if l am flying.

655
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:16,306
You silly, l'll make you fly...

656
01:18:03,256 --> 01:18:07,488
What happened at the studio that day...
- Yes, l saw. You dance very well.

657
01:18:09,262 --> 01:18:12,390
l meant what l did at the dance
studio the other day...

658
01:18:31,985 --> 01:18:33,646
What if we are caught?

659
01:18:34,321 --> 01:18:37,119
We must find out who he is.

660
01:18:37,824 --> 01:18:40,725
He dares to bring a twist
into Kkamini's life!

661
01:18:41,161 --> 01:18:43,129
He...what if he comes again?

662
01:18:44,831 --> 01:18:49,131
Babu, you are here, aren't you?
Can you whistle?

663
01:18:49,836 --> 01:18:50,803
Whistle!

664
01:18:55,508 --> 01:18:56,475
Now whistle.

665
01:21:37,203 --> 01:21:40,661
When the lord above gives,
He gives by the armful.

666
01:21:45,211 --> 01:21:46,178
Amar-Prem!

667
01:21:47,981 --> 01:21:49,778
What sort of surprise is this?

668
01:21:52,385 --> 01:21:56,685
Babu, what am l supposed
to do with these men?

669
01:21:58,391 --> 01:22:00,621
They are.. not with me.

670
01:22:02,162 --> 01:22:04,130
Thank God you cleared it up.

671
01:22:04,831 --> 01:22:07,664
By the way, man and man,
two men who live together...

672
01:22:08,168 --> 01:22:10,432
What are you doing in my suite?

673
01:22:14,174 --> 01:22:18,133
Oh, how come you know
it is my birthday?

674
01:22:19,846 --> 01:22:21,814
lt's not your birthday today.
- Oh, it is!

675
01:22:22,348 --> 01:22:24,339
Or else what would l be doing here?

676
01:22:24,918 --> 01:22:26,579
lf it's his birthday...

677
01:22:26,853 --> 01:22:29,219
And you came to give him a surprise...
- Where's the surprise?

678
01:22:29,522 --> 01:22:32,423
The birthday gift?
- lt'll be somewhere around.

679
01:22:32,725 --> 01:22:34,818
Because it's here. Look for it!

680
01:22:35,862 --> 01:22:39,559
She's kept it hidden.
But there'll be two surprise gifts.

681
01:22:39,866 --> 01:22:42,164
l can show you one
but the other...

682
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:49,172
This is our own new technique of
looking for the gift...

683
01:22:49,843 --> 01:22:51,674
...since childhood.

684
01:22:57,817 --> 01:22:59,648
Your doubts are gone and
you believe it, l hope?

685
01:23:17,904 --> 01:23:21,271
Where did the gift come from?
- This one?

686
01:23:22,876 --> 01:23:26,710
There are hundreds of gifts.
They were for you...

687
01:23:27,881 --> 01:23:32,375
They are for you...
And will always be for you.

688
01:23:43,997 --> 01:23:49,299
Accept love's sweet salute,
my darling.

689
01:23:50,270 --> 01:23:54,866
Just commit the folly
of loving me back.

690
01:23:56,843 --> 01:23:58,242
My heart's thrill...

691
01:23:58,811 --> 01:24:00,278
Your heart's thrill...

692
01:24:03,149 --> 01:24:04,514
Your heart's thrill...

693
01:24:05,852 --> 01:24:09,117
Thrill? No this bill.

694
01:24:09,956 --> 01:24:12,424
Who shall l give this bill to?

695
01:24:12,825 --> 01:24:16,693
To the uncle or will you pay?

696
01:24:26,306 --> 01:24:29,275
Raju Bro! The Dream girl's come, right.
How about an ice cream?

697
01:24:30,843 --> 01:24:33,141
One tight slap and
all the ice cream'll melt away.

698
01:24:43,923 --> 01:24:46,790
Tomorrow permit coming.
Day after Udaipur going.

699
01:24:47,293 --> 01:24:48,260
Tomorrow...?

700
01:24:53,933 --> 01:24:55,525
Veer Zaara the movie!

701
01:24:56,202 --> 01:24:58,102
Didn't l just say...

702
01:24:58,805 --> 01:25:00,796
You've to go to Udaipur
and l'm taking you there.

703
01:25:01,341 --> 01:25:04,105
And now you want to see
this movie Veer Zaara!

704
01:25:04,844 --> 01:25:11,113
Madam, permit tomorrow.
No permit. Police ask moolah...

705
01:25:15,822 --> 01:25:17,585
How to explain to her...

706
01:25:17,890 --> 01:25:19,585
Hey, Guddi. Come here.

707
01:25:21,961 --> 01:25:23,588
You know English, don't you?
- So?

708
01:25:23,830 --> 01:25:30,133
So nothing...Tell her,
the car's being arranged.

709
01:25:30,870 --> 01:25:33,805
l'll get the permit tomorrow and we
go to Udaipur the day after. Tell her.

710
01:25:35,875 --> 01:25:37,604
Go on, tell her.

711
01:25:37,877 --> 01:25:40,311
What? lce cream?

712
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:43,546
Chandulalji, one ice cream.
Tell her.

713
01:25:45,718 --> 01:25:46,685
What?

714
01:25:47,954 --> 01:25:49,649
My God!
What'll become of this country!

715
01:25:49,989 --> 01:25:52,685
lce cream for everyone.

716
01:26:04,137 --> 01:26:06,503
She's asking why you
are going with her.

717
01:26:08,808 --> 01:26:12,642
Tell her... there's something called
respon...lli...bi..

718
01:26:13,146 --> 01:26:15,842
Hey, speak in Hindi, man.
Guddi will explain it in English.

719
01:26:16,315 --> 01:26:21,116
Explain to her...she has no money.
So how'll she go?

720
01:26:31,764 --> 01:26:35,291
She says...
- l know that much English.

721
01:26:35,968 --> 01:26:42,430
Ask her why her boyfriend left her.

722
01:26:43,676 --> 01:26:45,701
She has a boyfriend too?
This is a totally different story.

723
01:26:46,179 --> 01:26:47,544
Very bad story.

724
01:26:59,859 --> 01:27:02,487
His family wants an lndian
daughter-in-law.

725
01:27:05,798 --> 01:27:07,493
Can't find the words...

726
01:27:08,868 --> 01:27:10,460
Explain to her...

727
01:27:10,803 --> 01:27:14,102
He has left his love
to trail his family's tail...

728
01:27:15,141 --> 01:27:17,302
So why's she crazy for him?

729
01:27:27,153 --> 01:27:32,352
She says if he marries someone else
she'll kill herself.

730
01:27:33,259 --> 01:27:35,727
What are you whispering for?
- Raju Bro, she says...

731
01:27:36,195 --> 01:27:40,256
When she finds her boyfriend,
she'll slap him and say bye forever.

732
01:27:40,566 --> 01:27:44,127
Nah, buddy.
She loves him very much.

733
01:27:44,837 --> 01:27:48,136
lf he marries someone else,
she'll kill herself.

734
01:27:50,977 --> 01:27:52,638
How did you know?

735
01:27:53,212 --> 01:27:55,373
What if l don't know her language?

736
01:27:57,116 --> 01:27:59,084
l can understand the
language of her eyes.

737
01:28:05,124 --> 01:28:08,560
Tell her that Raju will take her
to her destination.

738
01:28:50,169 --> 01:28:53,730
As Vidhurji said,
a draft for one million...

739
01:28:55,174 --> 01:28:56,732
...in Rahul's name.
- ln whose name?

740
01:28:57,243 --> 01:28:59,074
ln Rahoooul's name.

741
01:29:03,916 --> 01:29:06,714
This is just one.
There are 9 more to come.

742
01:29:15,261 --> 01:29:18,424
Don't try to cross your limits,
understand?

743
01:29:18,764 --> 01:29:22,495
Do everything in limits.
But in love...go beyond...

744
01:29:22,802 --> 01:29:24,531
all limits...
Understand?

745
01:29:29,809 --> 01:29:31,436
What are you doing?

746
01:29:34,780 --> 01:29:38,238
Always relax under tension.

747
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:42,581
This is only the beginning.

748
01:29:42,822 --> 01:29:45,313
Wait and see what happens
in the days to come.

749
01:29:53,733 --> 01:29:56,702
''Love is...''

750
01:30:36,876 --> 01:30:41,040
''l salute the dark magic
of your eyes.''

751
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:45,416
''l salute the dark
cloud of your hair.''

752
01:30:46,152 --> 01:30:50,316
''The music of your anklets wounds me
to the heart, my love''

753
01:30:50,823 --> 01:30:54,850
''Hey beautiful, l salute
your every lovely allure.''

754
01:30:55,261 --> 01:30:58,697
''Love's sweet salute.''

755
01:31:25,558 --> 01:31:29,892
''l salute the mystery of
your teasing banter.''

756
01:31:30,463 --> 01:31:34,126
''l salute nights drenched
in passion's colour.''

757
01:31:35,334 --> 01:31:39,236
''Lost in dreams am l.
Crazed with love am l.''

758
01:31:39,772 --> 01:31:43,799
''Hey beautiful, l salute
your every lovely allure.''

759
01:31:44,176 --> 01:31:46,872
''Love's sweet salute.''

760
01:32:03,462 --> 01:32:06,260
''Love is...''

761
01:32:06,999 --> 01:32:11,459
''Your hands are adorned with
henna's bridal red..''

762
01:32:12,004 --> 01:32:16,236
''You have found the lover
of your dreams.''

763
01:32:16,742 --> 01:32:21,111
''Our lovely bride is more precious
than the whole world.''

764
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:24,381
''O loving groom, carry her away
in the bridal palanquin.''

765
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:45,293
''When our eyes met the
very first time...''

766
01:32:45,805 --> 01:32:49,741
''l fell in love with you.''

767
01:32:50,576 --> 01:32:52,407
''Not just my heart...''

768
01:32:52,845 --> 01:32:54,836
''My life is yours to take.''

769
01:32:55,181 --> 01:32:58,844
''ln you l put my trust...''

770
01:32:59,919 --> 01:33:02,080
''For you, l'd even die.''

771
01:33:02,388 --> 01:33:04,253
''Look at what my crazed
love has made me do!''

772
01:33:04,723 --> 01:33:06,816
''My every heartbeat is
restless with longing.''

773
01:33:07,126 --> 01:33:09,094
''ln my eyes reside dreams of you.''

774
01:33:09,395 --> 01:33:13,229
''l salute my darling whom
l love more than life.''

775
01:33:13,732 --> 01:33:15,165
''Love's sweet salute.''

776
01:33:38,524 --> 01:33:40,151
''Love is...''

777
01:34:19,431 --> 01:34:23,993
''For your love l'd lay
down earth and heaven.''

778
01:34:24,436 --> 01:34:28,304
''Have faith in the
promise l make you.''

779
01:34:28,908 --> 01:34:33,345
''Heaven proclaims as
does this earth...''

780
01:34:33,946 --> 01:34:37,712
''There's none other like you !''

781
01:34:38,751 --> 01:34:43,017
''Don't cast such enticing lures.
l'm wary of coming close to you.''

782
01:34:43,422 --> 01:34:47,358
''Stop flattering me with false praise.
Join your heart to mine.''

783
01:34:47,927 --> 01:34:51,954
''l salute the prayer coming
deep from the heart.''

784
01:34:52,364 --> 01:34:54,229
''Love's sweet salute.''

785
01:35:32,738 --> 01:35:36,105
''My only plea to God...''

786
01:35:37,409 --> 01:35:40,901
''is to forgive me...''

787
01:35:41,947 --> 01:35:45,883
''...for l offer my worship
only to you.''

788
01:35:46,752 --> 01:35:51,121
''My darling, you don't know..''

789
01:35:51,457 --> 01:35:54,949
''..how much l love you.''

790
01:35:56,362 --> 01:35:58,262
''Without you there is no light.''

791
01:35:58,697 --> 01:36:00,688
''On my forehead l wear the
bridal red of your vow.''

792
01:36:01,033 --> 01:36:03,001
''My breath carries but one message...''

793
01:36:03,369 --> 01:36:05,337
''All l have is yours.''

794
01:36:06,205 --> 01:36:09,663
''l salute the beloved who
lives in my heart.''

795
01:36:10,509 --> 01:36:12,670
''Love's sweet salute.''

796
01:36:15,281 --> 01:36:19,342
''l salute the dark
magic of your eyes.''

797
01:36:19,918 --> 01:36:24,150
''l salute the dark
cloud of your hair.''

798
01:36:24,723 --> 01:36:29,092
''Lost in dreams am l.
Crazed with love am l.''

799
01:36:29,728 --> 01:36:33,129
''Hey beautiful, l salute
your every lovely allure.''

800
01:36:33,732 --> 01:36:36,326
''Love's sweet salute.''

801
01:36:57,690 --> 01:36:59,658
''Love is..''

802
01:37:52,952 --> 01:37:54,510
''Love's sweet salute.''

803
01:38:07,567 --> 01:38:12,095
Tehzeeb, l know you can hear me.

804
01:38:13,907 --> 01:38:15,875
l'll be left all alone without you.

805
01:38:17,577 --> 01:38:19,306
Come back...please!

806
01:39:05,925 --> 01:39:08,485
Mr.Hussain, she is Dr.Geeta Dixit.

807
01:39:14,901 --> 01:39:18,064
Tehzeeb is well enough but...

808
01:39:18,705 --> 01:39:20,332
But what, Doctor?

809
01:39:20,907 --> 01:39:22,932
The scan report shows...

810
01:39:29,282 --> 01:39:31,477
What does it mean?

811
01:39:32,218 --> 01:39:38,418
Mr. Hussain, lack of oxygen to
the brain for a fairly long time..

812
01:39:38,925 --> 01:39:40,893
...has caused partial memory loss.

813
01:39:42,462 --> 01:39:46,899
That's why, your daughter is
not the same Tehzeeb you know.

814
01:39:47,734 --> 01:39:51,397
That's why she recognizes
you both...

815
01:39:51,938 --> 01:39:54,304
...but has forgotten
Asutosh totally.

816
01:39:54,741 --> 01:39:56,504
Can l take her home?

817
01:40:37,617 --> 01:40:40,609
What is it now, Juggy?
- Photographs are memories.

818
01:40:42,088 --> 01:40:45,251
But when there's nothing
worth remembering...

819
01:40:45,625 --> 01:40:47,422
What's the point of photos?

820
01:40:51,697 --> 01:40:54,962
Some photos...gifts you gave me.
And these keys.

821
01:40:55,568 --> 01:40:58,230
Gia, there's no need for this.
- You don't but l need to.

822
01:41:02,675 --> 01:41:06,202
Wait.
l know you are upset.

823
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:11,081
Natural, it happens.
- lt's not happening to me.

824
01:41:14,954 --> 01:41:16,922
l am very happy, Shiven.

825
01:41:23,963 --> 01:41:28,491
But you'll see. When you realise that
it all happened for our good...

826
01:41:28,968 --> 01:41:30,936
You'll thank me.

827
01:41:33,773 --> 01:41:35,434
l have realised it.

828
01:41:36,008 --> 01:41:37,168
Realised what?

829
01:41:37,477 --> 01:41:40,105
That l don't have to spend my life
with someone like you.

830
01:41:52,992 --> 01:41:55,426
Oh, well!
So then celebrate!

831
01:42:05,638 --> 01:42:08,402
An idea straight from God!
An idea of that level.

832
01:42:08,741 --> 01:42:12,438
l'm gonna go home, change my clothes.

833
01:42:26,959 --> 01:42:29,223
This is my house...

834
01:42:39,639 --> 01:42:41,368
Raju Bro...
- Keep quiet!

835
01:42:52,285 --> 01:42:54,150
What're you doing, Maya darling!

836
01:42:54,487 --> 01:42:58,218
Raju Bro, see Maya has also
given a signal. Don't take her there.

837
01:42:58,591 --> 01:43:01,526
Try and understand, kiddo.
lt's not a matter of my love...

838
01:43:01,994 --> 01:43:03,894
but my love's love.

839
01:43:05,398 --> 01:43:06,365
Why, Gurudev?

840
01:43:10,636 --> 01:43:11,603
Get lost!

841
01:43:13,739 --> 01:43:17,197
Now Udaipur non-stop...

842
01:43:32,959 --> 01:43:33,926
Push...?

843
01:43:39,665 --> 01:43:41,530
Not to Udaipur! Just
a little further.

844
01:43:57,917 --> 01:43:58,884
Now push?

845
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:04,455
All right. You read your novel
and l'll handle my Maya.

846
01:44:04,924 --> 01:44:06,357
What're you up to, Maya darling!

847
01:44:07,093 --> 01:44:10,062
What're you up to, Maya! We go a long
way back as far as l can remember.

848
01:44:10,396 --> 01:44:13,297
Today when l'm helping a girl in love,
you are acting up!

849
01:44:13,633 --> 01:44:15,498
Don't be jealous, Maya.

850
01:44:15,935 --> 01:44:18,495
l'm with her only for this trip.
You and l are on a long journey.

That's the problem with you people.

Hurry up, Maya. Or she'll

864
01:45:39,652 --> 01:45:41,313
They'll both lie down.

865

So, the wedding will be next Sunday.

Sweetu my dear...

Go on, my dear...

ls your daughter pregnant, Satpalji?

874
01:46:43,749 --> 01:46:45,444
Just a little...

875
01:46:55,594 --> 01:46:56,526
Satpalji...

877
01:47:03,903 --> 01:47:05,871
Alas no...

Let's go.

879
01:48:15,574 --> 01:48:16,541
Listen...

880
01:48:17,409 --> 01:48:19,877

What am l doing here?
- l don't know.

883
01:49:02,888 --> 01:49:05,254
What do you know?

01:49:05,558 --> 01:49:07,526
The whole world knows that.
- O maiden...

01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:12,522
the prince charming
of your dreams is coming.

886
01:49:13,899 --> 01:49:18,393
The bridegroom brings his festive
procession and bridal palanquin.

887
01:49:19,905 --> 01:49:23,102
Await the auspicious moment...

''O sweetheart, l come to you

889
01:49:49,001 --> 01:49:52,129
''l come in a festive procession

890
01:49:53,372 --> 01:49:55,897
''O sweetheart, l come to you

''l am your love.
And you are my life.''

01:51:16,488 --> 01:51:18,149
''Don't hide anything at all.''

900
01:51:18,490 --> 01:51:22,324
''Such beautiful love is so
hard to find, my darling.''

901
01:51:22,628 --> 01:51:27,588
''l don't want to lose something
as precious as you.''

902
01:52:19,752 --> 01:52:22,915
''Don't torment me so,
O my darling...''

903
01:52:23,956 --> 01:52:27,915
''Just give me a look out of
your intoxicating eyes.''

904
01:52:35,667 --> 01:52:40,104
''O my darling, join
your voice...''

905
01:52:40,472 --> 01:52:43,930
''to mine.''

906
01:52:44,376 --> 01:52:46,276
''Say yes, come on. Say yes.''

907
01:52:46,645 --> 01:52:50,376
''You've made me restless with
longing, O dream lover''

908
01:52:50,682 --> 01:52:55,483
''l tell this world... l am yours.

01:53:12,638 --> 01:53:15,903
''To you l will give my heart.''

913
01:53:33,959 --> 01:53:37,554
Madam, one Rohit proposal
down... Party?

914
01:53:38,597 --> 01:53:41,430
Lucknow's famed lamb curry spiced
with Bareli chillies...

915
01:53:41,733 --> 01:53:45,499
Dal topped with Khurja's special cream,
flaky parathas with butter..

916
01:53:45,971 --> 01:53:47,996
And Banaras paan afterwards.
- But sir!

917
01:53:48,307 --> 01:53:52,038
l know it's impossible.
Get what you have.

918
01:53:52,377 --> 01:53:55,869
My brain is boiling with hunger.
- lmmediately, sir.

919
01:53:57,482 --> 01:53:58,574
Come, madam.

920
01:54:02,621 --> 01:54:05,283
Hindi class good?

921
01:54:06,725 --> 01:54:09,216
Listen !
- Listen? So tell me.

922
01:54:10,996 --> 01:54:11,963
Very good.

923
01:54:12,598 --> 01:54:15,590
Listen, l have written something
what l want to say..

924
01:54:16,101 --> 01:54:19,468
...when Rohit's mother
and father...l meet...

925
01:54:19,938 --> 01:54:24,307
l get it. You want to say something
to the jackass' parents? Go ahead.

926
01:54:26,178 --> 01:54:27,577
Dear mother and father...

927
01:54:28,013 --> 01:54:32,416
..half the world to
marry your son... l have roamed...

928
01:54:32,951 --> 01:54:35,579
Please accept your cow

929
01:54:38,757 --> 01:54:41,123
Not cow. Daughter-in-law!

930
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:43,052
Daughter-in-law...?

931
01:54:45,964 --> 01:54:50,492
This book... not good.
Funny!

932
01:54:54,473 --> 01:54:56,441
Are you bringing my order?
- Coming sir!

933
01:54:56,909 --> 01:54:57,876
l'm ravenous.

934
01:55:04,616 --> 01:55:07,084
l tell you and you will write it down?
OK, write.

935
01:55:10,088 --> 01:55:11,055
Write.

936
01:55:12,424 --> 01:55:13,391
Listen, you goon...

937
01:55:13,625 --> 01:55:18,562
Listen...you goon.
Swine of a Paaji owl...

938
01:55:20,732 --> 01:55:22,700
Ruin and damnation upon you.

939
01:55:24,636 --> 01:55:26,604
Your son is jackass no.1.

940
01:55:28,140 --> 01:55:32,577
Dimwit of an owl..
..who doesn't know what love means.

941
01:55:33,045 --> 01:55:35,070
Go to hell... all of you !

942
01:55:38,951 --> 01:55:41,920
Swine of a Paaji owl...
Ruin and damnation....

943
01:55:44,690 --> 01:55:46,214
Let it be...

944
01:55:47,025 --> 01:55:50,927
Speak in English.
Speak from the heart.

945
01:55:51,663 --> 01:55:53,392
They will understand.

946
01:55:54,967 --> 01:55:55,865
Eat?

947
01:55:58,036 --> 01:55:59,503
No, not this.

948
01:55:59,905 --> 01:56:04,137
This food not for English...
Only for lndian.

949
01:56:22,494 --> 01:56:25,588
Heroine's wedding
means goodbye to her film career.

950
01:56:26,164 --> 01:56:29,224
lt wasn't part of the plan.
Then why did you do it? Why?

951
01:56:30,669 --> 01:56:32,364
Why did you do it?

952
01:56:34,940 --> 01:56:35,907
Why...

953
01:56:37,642 --> 01:56:39,473
You know why l did it.

954
01:56:43,749 --> 01:56:45,717
What else could l do under
the circumstances.

955
01:56:48,086 --> 01:56:49,917
You wanted it too.

956
01:56:51,957 --> 01:56:54,926
But if l hadn't done what l did,
there'd be a mess up.

957
01:56:55,927 --> 01:56:57,861
How'd the plan progress?

958
01:56:59,898 --> 01:57:00,865
Plan?

959
01:57:04,669 --> 01:57:10,266
Yes, plan.
What did you think?

960
01:57:15,414 --> 01:57:17,109
What were you thinking?

961
01:57:19,284 --> 01:57:21,275
What deep game are you playing?

962
01:57:21,686 --> 01:57:23,881
Amazing! You are asking me?

963
01:57:24,623 --> 01:57:30,061
The game that you had started.
The Rahul-Kkamini game of love.

964
01:57:31,663 --> 01:57:32,630
Listen...

965
01:57:33,498 --> 01:57:38,435
Rahul's entry changed Kkamini from
ltem Girl to girl-next-door.

966
01:57:38,937 --> 01:57:42,566
But to sign a Karan Johar film,
she must turn into a queen...

967
01:57:43,041 --> 01:57:46,909
And that too, Tragedy Queen.

968
01:57:47,679 --> 01:57:52,912
Look boss. You aren't getting
10 million to spout philosophy.

969
01:57:53,685 --> 01:57:58,418
You listen, boss. l gave you a 100
million bucks plan for a million.

970
01:57:58,990 --> 01:58:03,188
Listen to the second half of the plan.
- One more plan !

971
01:58:03,595 --> 01:58:05,495
You don't want to hear?
- Okay, tell us.

972
01:58:05,897 --> 01:58:06,864
Thanks.

973
01:58:09,935 --> 01:58:10,959
Kkamini's plan...

974
01:58:11,903 --> 01:58:13,165
Rahul's entry...

975
01:58:13,705 --> 01:58:15,297
Rahul and Kkamini's love story...

976
01:58:15,574 --> 01:58:17,007
Love... Wedding preparations...

977
01:58:17,609 --> 01:58:20,100
And an engagement ring...

978
01:58:27,519 --> 01:58:29,453
The whole world is crazy...

979
01:58:30,622 --> 01:58:33,455
Only one question echoing...
When is the wedding?

980
01:58:33,925 --> 01:58:35,893
When is the wedding?

981
01:58:37,095 --> 01:58:38,892
Only one echoing answer...

982
01:58:41,633 --> 01:58:43,498
Tomorrow...yes tomorrow.

983
01:58:43,935 --> 01:58:47,462
But... Tomorrow Never Comes.

984
01:58:50,609 --> 01:58:54,568
There may be a tomorrow but
...no Rahul.

985
01:58:55,881 --> 01:58:56,848
Why?

986
01:58:57,883 --> 01:58:59,180
A Rainy Night...

987
01:59:00,185 --> 01:59:02,847
Journey... Just One Mistake...
and accident!

988
01:59:26,611 --> 01:59:30,274
l'm Karan Johar speaking.
l'm so sorry, l just came to know...

989
01:59:30,615 --> 01:59:32,344
...that Rahul is dead.

990
01:59:35,987 --> 01:59:37,887
One story ends.

991
01:59:39,591 --> 01:59:41,525
A new life begins.

992
01:59:43,728 --> 01:59:46,060
You lose something to gain something.

993
01:59:48,934 --> 01:59:50,902
Rahul is lost...

994
02:00:04,649 --> 02:00:07,516
You've really delivered
a million's worth.

995
02:00:11,022 --> 02:00:15,425
Listen... You are forgetting
something...

996
02:00:18,964 --> 02:00:20,625
Put it on yourself.

997
02:01:57,128 --> 02:01:59,096
l'll introduce you
to my friends. Come...

998
02:02:18,249 --> 02:02:20,240
Where're you going? Please stop.

999
02:02:20,618 --> 02:02:22,518
No, Anjali. l should be sorry.

1000
02:02:30,695 --> 02:02:32,424
Why are you with me?

1001
02:02:33,698 --> 02:02:37,156
They are of your age. Not me.

1002
02:02:38,570 --> 02:02:40,504
l am not in the least like them.

1003
02:02:42,440 --> 02:02:45,409
l'm with you because you
are not like them.

1004
02:02:46,978 --> 02:02:49,947
None of them can do what
you did in there.

1005
02:02:51,182 --> 02:02:53,946
Because they are not what you are...

1006
02:02:54,686 --> 02:02:57,519
....crazy...crazily in love with me.

1007
02:03:31,356 --> 02:03:33,051
Are you all right, Vinay?

1008
02:03:36,961 --> 02:03:38,223
You shaved?

1009
02:03:39,431 --> 02:03:42,195
Yes... no... ls it okay?

1010
02:03:44,636 --> 02:03:45,933
lt's different...

1011
02:03:46,337 --> 02:03:51,331
Malhotraji, it's very good news.
Your heart is perfectly okay.

1012
02:03:51,776 --> 02:03:54,609
Heart...! What heart
problem does he have?

1013
02:03:55,046 --> 02:03:57,071
Who is she?
- She...

1014
02:03:58,616 --> 02:04:00,550
she is my wife.

1015
02:04:00,985 --> 02:04:02,885
Oh, Mrs.Malhotraji.

1016
02:04:05,590 --> 02:04:08,525
Nothing to worry about.
He's perfectly fit and fine.

1017
02:04:09,027 --> 02:04:10,995
l was told on the phone
that he had an accident.

1018
02:04:11,262 --> 02:04:12,957
Then why a heart check-up?
- Well...

1019
02:04:13,164 --> 02:04:16,565
You keep quiet... You tell me.
- lt's nothing.

1020
02:04:17,035 --> 02:04:19,469
Just a routine check-up.
- Didn't l say, a routine check up?

1021
02:04:19,737 --> 02:04:22,604
Actually, your daughter told
me he had chest pain.

1022
02:04:23,107 --> 02:04:24,369
Daughter!?
- Yes.

1023
02:04:24,676 --> 02:04:27,304
Shai..?
- Shy? Oh, not in the least.

1024
02:04:27,612 --> 02:04:32,072
She's really rough and tough.
A really lovely girl.

1025
02:04:34,118 --> 02:04:35,312
Shall we go?

1026
02:05:52,330 --> 02:05:57,029
l don't want to hear anything!
Where you were, who you were with...

1027
02:05:57,368 --> 02:05:59,859
How it all happened,
why you didn't go to office...

1028
02:06:00,171 --> 02:06:02,196
Why that girl went to the
hospital with you...

1029
02:06:02,574 --> 02:06:06,101
Even if she did, what
was the need to lie...

1030
02:06:06,411 --> 02:06:08,538
Seema, you are ranting on,
talking nonsense!

1031
02:06:09,581 --> 02:06:12,277
What lie did l tell? What lie?

1032
02:06:13,551 --> 02:06:17,078
Do l have only one thing to do? There
are errands to run outside the office.

1033
02:06:17,589 --> 02:06:21,184
l told you about Kkamini's party,
didn't l? Had to go out for it.

1034
02:06:21,626 --> 02:06:23,890
l was crossing the road.
A car came by suddenly.

1035
02:06:26,230 --> 02:06:28,892
The poor girl was standing there.
She took me to the hospital.

1036
02:06:31,135 --> 02:06:33,501
And they ask a 100 questions
at the hospital.

1037
02:06:33,972 --> 02:06:35,906
How did it happen? When?
Who are you?

1038
02:06:36,107 --> 02:06:39,042
l just said she was my daughter.
You'll nag me to death for it?

1039
02:06:49,621 --> 02:06:52,317
Why's Mamma crying, Papa?

1040
02:06:54,025 --> 02:06:55,856
Because Papa made a mistake.

1041
02:06:56,094 --> 02:06:58,085
While crossing the road?

1042
02:06:59,430 --> 02:07:03,867
Yes, son.
- Did you look left? Then right?

1043
02:07:04,602 --> 02:07:08,003
No, son.
- Where was your attention, Papa?

1044
02:07:12,076 --> 02:07:17,036
l got distracted. That's why
Papa made a mistake, son.

1045
02:07:17,448 --> 02:07:19,575
You won't make this mistake
again, will you?

1046
02:07:22,654 --> 02:07:23,621
Never.

1047
02:07:36,634 --> 02:07:38,898
Mamma, Papa promised.

1048
02:07:41,673 --> 02:07:44,608
Come, you've school tomorrow.
Go to bed.

1049
02:07:54,719 --> 02:08:00,248
l don't know what all l thought.
You've changed so much...

1050
02:08:00,892 --> 02:08:04,259
l was scared.
l never stopped to think...

1051
02:08:04,929 --> 02:08:07,864
...you'd never do something
like this to us.

1052
02:08:11,703 --> 02:08:13,170
Forgive me.

1053
02:08:38,930 --> 02:08:40,420
What's this, Guru !

1054
02:08:41,599 --> 02:08:44,067
Their connection is on...

1055
02:08:45,002 --> 02:08:48,563
There's a forced disturbance
in my line...

1056
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:51,338
At least set her connection right.

1057
02:08:51,642 --> 02:08:56,375
From when the poor girl has been
calling left, right and centre!

1058
02:08:57,582 --> 02:09:01,177
Go on, Sukhi.
- We're in luck, Paaji.

1059
02:09:01,519 --> 02:09:03,487
Col. Bakshi has consented
to the wedding.

1060
02:09:04,122 --> 02:09:05,851
Bakshi is ready?

1061
02:09:06,891 --> 02:09:11,260
Oh no, pal. lt's a big risk.
The marriage is already fixed.

1062
02:09:11,629 --> 02:09:13,290
But Paaji...
- Shut up, Sukhi.

1063
02:09:15,967 --> 02:09:20,870
Listen Sukhi. Tell Bakshi Saheb
we agree to the wedding.

1064
02:09:48,099 --> 02:09:49,896
How're you, Tehzeeb?

1065
02:10:08,219 --> 02:10:12,918
They're all friends here.
l'll be back soon.

1066
02:10:42,320 --> 02:10:45,289
We are at Anarkali Bazar
near the Lahore stadium.

1067
02:10:45,590 --> 02:10:47,558
The people of Lahore
are spreading cheer...

1068
02:10:47,992 --> 02:10:49,960
in the joy of the lndian team's
visit to Pakistan. Just a minute...

1069
02:10:50,161 --> 02:10:51,128
5 minutes!

1070
02:10:51,762 --> 02:10:54,356
Go away.
- Go where? l've come from so far.

1071
02:10:54,665 --> 02:10:56,360
We are live... LlVE!

1072
02:11:04,141 --> 02:11:08,305
Let's ask what they think of this
historic lndia-Pakistan series.

1073
02:11:08,646 --> 02:11:10,614
Uncle, do you want to say something?

1074
02:11:11,082 --> 02:11:14,449
The atmosphere is very nice. Business
has doubled because of the match.

1075
02:11:14,752 --> 02:11:15,912
How wonderful!

1076
02:11:19,690 --> 02:11:23,251
Salaam. Have you any message
for your lndian brothers?

1077
02:11:23,594 --> 02:11:25,391
l want to say something.

1078
02:11:27,098 --> 02:11:29,623
Would anyone like to say something?
- Strange!

1079
02:11:30,134 --> 02:11:32,261
l've something to say
and l'm not allowed to speak!

1080
02:11:32,570 --> 02:11:34,538
Will anybody in Lahore
give ME a hearing?

1081
02:11:37,708 --> 02:11:40,506
Speak, son. l am with you.

1082
02:11:41,145 --> 02:11:43,545
l am Ashu and she is Tehzeeb.

1083
02:11:47,518 --> 02:11:51,284
l love her and she loves
me too... Don't you?

1084
02:11:52,156 --> 02:11:55,523
But we can't get married because
l'm a Hindu and she is a Muslim.

1085
02:11:55,960 --> 02:12:00,226
My parents are against this marriage.
Before coming here, she said to me...

1086
02:12:00,564 --> 02:12:04,295
Think, Ashu... if we marry,
what'll our tomorrow be like?

1087
02:12:06,938 --> 02:12:10,533
All l have to say is this,
whatever our tomorrow may be...

1088
02:12:12,109 --> 02:12:14,202
we'll make it beautiful together.

1089
02:12:18,950 --> 02:12:23,478
But if you are not with me,
l have neither today nor tomorrow.

1090
02:12:26,991 --> 02:12:30,586
So Tehzeeb, will you
give me my tomorrow?

1091
02:12:38,769 --> 02:12:40,532
Will you marry me?

1092
02:13:29,086 --> 02:13:30,986
l can't remember anything.

1093
02:13:34,191 --> 02:13:36,921
This is a strange story...

1094
02:13:37,695 --> 02:13:39,253
Where does it begin...

1095
02:13:39,530 --> 02:13:42,499
She started...she started!
She started...

1096
02:13:42,967 --> 02:13:46,266
Bright smiling face...

1097
02:13:46,704 --> 02:13:47,932
Yes, Madam.

1098
02:13:49,774 --> 02:13:52,572
lt's only this Raju who can repair Maya.

1099
02:13:58,916 --> 02:14:02,477
What are you saying!?
You not stepney! You front tyre!

1100
02:14:10,928 --> 02:14:12,987
Rohit call... come?

1101
02:14:20,004 --> 02:14:22,302
No worries... only smiles.

1102
02:14:23,474 --> 02:14:25,465
We'll go to Rishikesh..
Meet Rohit ...

1103
02:14:25,943 --> 02:14:28,912
Then girlfriend boyfriend
marriage and Raju's ruin !.

1104
02:14:30,748 --> 02:14:31,715
Nothing.

1105
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:44,325
Of course l have.

1106
02:14:45,629 --> 02:14:50,999
But she is leaving me...
going... to her boyfriend.

1107
02:15:02,546 --> 02:15:07,040
No, madam. Girlfriend good...
from head to toe good.

1108
02:15:07,952 --> 02:15:12,946
l haven't said l love
you to her till now.

1109
02:15:18,095 --> 02:15:22,088
You see, l don't know how
to say l love you ....

1110
02:15:55,432 --> 02:15:57,525
l too love you.

1111
02:16:00,604 --> 02:16:01,571
Huh..!?

1112
02:16:08,612 --> 02:16:10,512
l too love you.

1113
02:17:51,949 --> 02:17:55,350
l was just passing by.

1114
02:17:55,886 --> 02:17:58,286
Thought l'd meet you.

1115
02:18:01,892 --> 02:18:02,859
Why?

1116
02:18:04,695 --> 02:18:06,390
Can't we even meet, Gia?

1117
02:18:09,900 --> 02:18:11,868
We could have met, Shiven.

1118
02:18:14,104 --> 02:18:15,867
That is, if you wanted to.

1119
02:18:17,574 --> 02:18:19,542
l always wanted us to meet...

1120
02:18:28,919 --> 02:18:31,012
We had such good times together, Gia.

1121
02:18:32,923 --> 02:18:35,892
Only good times... Not bad times.

1122
02:18:38,729 --> 02:18:41,163
But Shiven, love is what's
there at all times...

1123
02:18:41,699 --> 02:18:45,897
Because love is not about good times
but who you spend time with.

1124
02:18:49,106 --> 02:18:51,540
lt's so complicated even
when you hear it...

1125
02:18:58,582 --> 02:19:01,415
Like?
- Like we were.

1126
02:19:11,929 --> 02:19:15,865
This good time, bad time...
Today, tomorrow...

1127
02:19:16,900 --> 02:19:18,868
Who knows what tomorrow brings.

1128
02:19:20,904 --> 02:19:21,871
l know.

1129
02:19:23,907 --> 02:19:25,875
l know about my tomorrow, Shiven.

1130
02:19:27,544 --> 02:19:29,478
l am getting married tomorrow.

1131
02:19:33,217 --> 02:19:37,278
They went to Delhi?
But we were told that...

1132
02:19:37,588 --> 02:19:40,284
if your daughter was rejected
they were to go to Jammu.

1133
02:19:40,624 --> 02:19:43,457
What...?
That dirty, low-down sinner!

1134
02:19:43,927 --> 02:19:47,158
Who is he to reject us?
We broke it off.

1135
02:19:47,531 --> 02:19:50,091
Col. Bakshi has lost his mind!

1136
02:19:56,974 --> 02:20:00,239
Rohit, dial Canada. Give our
relatives the good news.

1137
02:20:01,145 --> 02:20:02,908
Okay, give it to me. l'll phone.

1138
02:20:05,949 --> 02:20:08,008
Your call.
- Yes.

1139
02:20:14,024 --> 02:20:15,924
lt's your sister from Canada.

1140
02:20:16,527 --> 02:20:18,586
l'll give her the good
news of your wedding.

1141
02:20:31,742 --> 02:20:34,336
Rohit, your sister wants
to talk to you.

1142
02:21:07,978 --> 02:21:12,108
Hurry. We'll reach Delhi
in 3 hours. Quick... hurry.

1143
02:21:14,952 --> 02:21:16,920
Where's she going off looking so sad?

1144
02:21:21,959 --> 02:21:22,983
Listen !

1145
02:21:24,661 --> 02:21:28,927
That's not the way. This is the way.
Where're you going off?

1146
02:21:29,733 --> 02:21:32,224
Taxi waiting.

1147
02:21:41,011 --> 02:21:42,342
What over?

1148
02:21:45,649 --> 02:21:47,947
No end... start.

1149
02:21:50,187 --> 02:21:51,950
lt's the beginning.

1150
02:21:55,225 --> 02:21:57,022
Rohit waiting there...

1151
02:22:01,598 --> 02:22:04,590
So what if he says that?
Will you believe it? Come with me.

1152
02:22:08,939 --> 02:22:09,906
But listen...

1153
02:22:11,742 --> 02:22:13,209
Listen to me...

1154
02:22:14,945 --> 02:22:16,207
Listen to me...

1155
02:22:18,615 --> 02:22:20,242
Will you listen to me or not?

1156
02:22:21,652 --> 02:22:22,619
Shut up!

1157
02:22:27,124 --> 02:22:28,921
l'll give you a tight slap!

1158
02:22:29,526 --> 02:22:32,495
Your hope of lndian woman?
No, no hope.

1159
02:22:34,498 --> 02:22:38,400
Eating egg curry and parathas
don't make you an lndian woman.

1160
02:22:38,969 --> 02:22:41,494
You don't become an lndian woman
reading Hindi English novels.

1161
02:22:41,972 --> 02:22:44,338
Giving up hope and turning
your back on love...

1162
02:22:44,641 --> 02:22:46,438
... will never make you lndian.

1163
02:22:47,978 --> 02:22:50,276
lndian woman fight!

1164
02:22:52,683 --> 02:22:55,277
Fight for love, fight for husband!

1165
02:22:57,287 --> 02:23:00,313
So, what did the jackass say?
Must've said...

1166
02:23:00,624 --> 02:23:04,526
l can't marry you Stephanie.
Can't go against my parents.

1167
02:23:05,062 --> 02:23:07,496
lf he runs away, you'll
also turn coward?

1168
02:23:10,667 --> 02:23:14,228
Come with me. l'll take
you there in 3 hours.

1169
02:23:14,638 --> 02:23:17,903
We'll go there, talk and
then marriage to Rohit.

1170
02:23:36,593 --> 02:23:41,326
When you meet Rohit, it's
what you say, l love you...

1171
02:23:42,666 --> 02:23:46,067
That's the reason... Come.

1172
02:23:50,440 --> 02:23:52,271
Where are we going?

1173
02:23:52,643 --> 02:23:54,406
Just one more attempt...

1174
02:23:58,915 --> 02:24:00,473
Your hair's turned white, uncle!

1175
02:24:01,618 --> 02:24:02,880
Ashu Baba, you !

1176
02:24:03,186 --> 02:24:05,279
Madam, look who has come!

1177
02:24:05,622 --> 02:24:07,055
Madam, look who has come!

1178
02:24:07,424 --> 02:24:09,289
l'm on the terrace, drying clothes.
- Oh, let the work be, madam.

1179
02:24:09,593 --> 02:24:13,290
Come and see who's here!
- l'm coming. Why are you shouting?

1180
02:24:16,933 --> 02:24:17,900
My son...

1181
02:24:26,576 --> 02:24:29,010
Son, your father...
- We'll leave.

1182
02:24:29,946 --> 02:24:31,413
Just a while.

1183
02:24:34,017 --> 02:24:35,917
Tehzeeb has lost her memory.

1184
02:24:37,654 --> 02:24:39,554
Perhaps this place might...

1185
02:24:40,524 --> 02:24:42,515
At least get some water, Kaka.

1186
02:24:44,695 --> 02:24:47,391
Where are all the servants gone!
Our daughter-in-law is home.

1187
02:24:59,976 --> 02:25:03,878
Do you remember this place, Tehzeeb?
Remember that day...

1188
02:25:05,048 --> 02:25:06,879
Garlands of flowers everywhere...

1189
02:25:07,918 --> 02:25:12,184
All the people...the bustle...

1190
02:25:13,623 --> 02:25:15,887
Music...lights...

1191
02:25:18,128 --> 02:25:19,891
The festive air...

1192
02:25:20,931 --> 02:25:22,592
And the wedding canopy...

1193
02:25:24,668 --> 02:25:28,297
Panditji reciting mantras, everyone
busy with wedding preparations...

1194
02:25:30,107 --> 02:25:35,238
Nidhi's wedding...
Your best friend... And my sister.

1195
02:25:35,612 --> 02:25:37,307
Look, the groom's party has arrived.

1196
02:25:42,652 --> 02:25:46,452
Remember, Tehzeeb.
- l don't remember a thing!

1197
02:25:46,957 --> 02:25:48,925
Try and remember, please.

1198
02:25:50,961 --> 02:25:53,930
Look, Nidhi's friends
are all coming down...

1199
02:26:00,570 --> 02:26:02,538
Laughing and chattering...

1200
02:26:05,075 --> 02:26:07,009
And your face amongst them all...

1201
02:26:07,677 --> 02:26:09,872
My heart stopped beating
when l saw your face...

1202
02:26:10,080 --> 02:26:12,446
Congratulations, Kaka.
Nidhi is a bride!

1203
02:26:12,916 --> 02:26:14,884
Shall l make you a bride too?

1204
02:26:15,585 --> 02:26:17,576
You think it's easy? lt'll
be very difficult.

1205
02:26:18,054 --> 02:26:21,546
Know why? Because l'm not going
to marry just anybody...

1206
02:26:25,028 --> 02:26:27,087
Saved in time.
- Not me!

1207
02:26:29,633 --> 02:26:30,600
Naughty!

1208
02:26:38,175 --> 02:26:40,905
Remember anything? Something?

1209
02:26:41,645 --> 02:26:44,136
Please try. Remember those people...

1210
02:26:45,949 --> 02:26:50,283
What people! What wedding?
What day? l don't remember anything!

1211
02:26:50,620 --> 02:26:52,588
Who let these people in?

1212
02:26:57,127 --> 02:26:58,856
Are the servants all dead?

1213
02:27:05,936 --> 02:27:09,337
Tehzeeb met with an accident.

1214
02:27:10,907 --> 02:27:13,876
She lost her memory.
- Congratulations!

1215
02:27:14,911 --> 02:27:17,471
Now finally he has a chance to
mend his mistake. Make him understand.

1216
02:27:18,615 --> 02:27:21,584
Tell him to leave her...
so he can rectify his life even now.

1217
02:27:26,923 --> 02:27:29,551
Don't say that!

1218
02:27:32,128 --> 02:27:34,289
He is in trouble.
- Then why has he come here?

1219
02:27:35,632 --> 02:27:39,466
Where else will a son go if not home?
- He should've thought of it...

1220
02:27:39,936 --> 02:27:42,234
the day he married a Muslim.

1221
02:27:46,610 --> 02:27:48,578
Tell him. There's nothing
in this house to give him.

1222
02:27:48,945 --> 02:27:50,310
There is, father.

1223
02:27:54,718 --> 02:27:56,242
Your hatred.

1224
02:27:58,889 --> 02:28:00,857
l have come to ask for it.

1225
02:28:07,964 --> 02:28:09,522
Hate Tehzeeb...

1226
02:28:13,670 --> 02:28:19,404
...exactly the way you did when
she first came here as a bride.

1227
02:28:21,578 --> 02:28:25,480
Tehzeeb doesn't remember anything,
not even my love.

1228
02:28:28,551 --> 02:28:30,883
Perhaps she might remember
your hatred.

1229
02:28:31,922 --> 02:28:33,890
lf not my love, your hate may
perhaps give her back her life.

1230
02:28:38,929 --> 02:28:43,298
Please, father...
Give back Tehzeeb her memories.

1231
02:28:45,936 --> 02:28:47,904
Please hate her, father!

1232
02:29:00,684 --> 02:29:02,379
Why weren't you answering my calls?

1233
02:29:02,686 --> 02:29:06,349
Anjali...! l was about to call you...

1234
02:29:13,697 --> 02:29:17,224
A lot is happening.
l need a little time.

1235
02:29:17,600 --> 02:29:21,366
l don't have time, Vinay. l'm going
to Paris. l have a dance scholarship.

1236
02:29:25,075 --> 02:29:28,875
What're you saying?
l have a job here...

1237
02:29:29,913 --> 02:29:33,474
a family. A home...
My life is here.

1238
02:29:33,950 --> 02:29:35,884
ls this the kind of life you want?

1239
02:29:36,920 --> 02:29:39,047
l don't know what l want...

1240
02:29:40,991 --> 02:29:44,290
l hardly know what to do...
what to say...

1241
02:29:44,594 --> 02:29:46,585
Don't say anything, Vinay. Just
listen to your heart...

1242
02:29:49,132 --> 02:29:51,896
...the way l heard... And saw...

1243
02:29:52,736 --> 02:29:56,502
l see in your eyes a man who
wants a lot from life.

1244
02:29:58,174 --> 02:30:00,142
l will give you all that.

1245
02:30:08,351 --> 02:30:10,376
Just us...you and me.

1246
02:30:24,267 --> 02:30:25,928
Papa phoned...

1247
02:30:27,203 --> 02:30:28,932
Gia is getting married.

1248
02:30:29,639 --> 02:30:31,607
l came to collect the tickets.

1249
02:30:34,744 --> 02:30:36,712
Perhaps you are going somewhere else.

1250
02:30:51,694 --> 02:30:52,956
Just a minute...

1251
02:31:02,238 --> 02:31:06,174
Looking at the photos?
l thought l'd appear in person...

1252
02:31:06,643 --> 02:31:09,771
and come close to you.
- What do you want now, Rahul?

1253
02:31:12,816 --> 02:31:13,783
Nothing.

1254
02:31:16,653 --> 02:31:19,952
l got what l wanted.
- What?

1255
02:31:21,424 --> 02:31:23,016
Being with you.

1256
02:31:24,327 --> 02:31:26,625
You can't stop playing this game
even for a second, can you?

1257
02:31:30,166 --> 02:31:34,102
Consider, just for a second...
What if this is not a game?

1258
02:31:38,374 --> 02:31:41,172
What if Raooul really loves Kkamini?

1259
02:31:42,679 --> 02:31:44,647
What if he has always loved her?

1260
02:31:46,483 --> 02:31:51,978
From the time Kkamini
was not Kkamini... but was Kamna?

1261
02:31:53,823 --> 02:31:58,692
An ordinary singer at a
small hotel in Dehradun.

1262
02:32:01,297 --> 02:32:07,600
From the time Rahul was
not Raooul but Rahul...

1263
02:32:09,772 --> 02:32:15,005
An ordinary waiter at the same hotel...

1264
02:32:19,816 --> 02:32:22,614
...whose only desire was Kamna...

1265
02:32:23,653 --> 02:32:29,216
...whose only dream
was Kamna's love...

1266
02:32:34,797 --> 02:32:38,927
Okay, let's leave it at that.
Let go of all those old things.

1267
02:32:40,470 --> 02:32:42,131
But if today...

1268
02:32:43,673 --> 02:32:45,641
lf Rahul were to ask Kamna...

1269
02:32:46,676 --> 02:32:49,645
Will Kamna fulfil Rahul's
unfulfilled dream?

1270
02:32:59,622 --> 02:33:03,922
lf Rahul were to say today,
Kamna, l love you...

1271
02:33:06,796 --> 02:33:08,593
Will you marry me?

1272
02:33:09,866 --> 02:33:10,855
Wait...

1273
02:33:12,635 --> 02:33:16,196
lf there is a knock on the
door at the same time?

1274
02:33:22,645 --> 02:33:23,612
Then...?

1275
02:33:27,383 --> 02:33:29,783
And today, Kkamini's dream
is standing at the door...

1276
02:33:32,355 --> 02:33:34,323
...money, name, fame...

1277
02:33:35,792 --> 02:33:37,623
A whole new life...

1278
02:33:39,329 --> 02:33:44,289
A life that begins with Rahul's death?

1279
02:33:47,670 --> 02:33:52,039
What if Kkamini has to choose
between her dream and Rahul?

1280
02:33:55,211 --> 02:33:58,703
Your dream has come true!
Karan Johar announced his new film.

1281
02:33:59,048 --> 02:34:01,016
You know, he's thinking
of casting you !

1282
02:34:01,317 --> 02:34:03,285
This means we must act quickly...

1283
02:34:10,627 --> 02:34:11,889
This means..

1284
02:34:14,330 --> 02:34:16,127
Rahul must die.

1285
02:34:23,740 --> 02:34:26,937
Hey, aren't you going to wish me
a loving goodnight?

1286
02:34:30,346 --> 02:34:32,746
All right...listen...

1287
02:34:33,716 --> 02:34:35,616
May not be love...

1288
02:34:36,653 --> 02:34:38,746
But l surely found answers
to my questions.

1289
02:34:40,690 --> 02:34:42,954
Oh, l forgot the most
important thing...

1290
02:34:52,335 --> 02:34:53,302
My wine...

1291
02:34:55,738 --> 02:34:58,730
Congratulations on the tears of joy.

1292
02:35:13,623 --> 02:35:15,147
What're you doing?

1293
02:35:17,660 --> 02:35:19,150
l'm talking to you !

1294
02:35:20,630 --> 02:35:23,793
What are you doing? What's all this!
- Lower your voice.

1295
02:35:24,334 --> 02:35:26,063
Listen to me...
- Rohan and Shai are home.

1296
02:35:26,302 --> 02:35:28,964
l know...
- They don't have to see this drama.

1297
02:35:29,305 --> 02:35:32,172
This is not some drama!
- Let go my hand!

1298
02:35:32,642 --> 02:35:35,008
Then first listen to me.
- There's nothing to listen.

1299
02:35:35,311 --> 02:35:37,006
l have seen it.

1300
02:35:54,664 --> 02:35:56,564
Why did you do it, Vinay?

1301
02:35:58,368 --> 02:36:00,029
Weren't you happy?

1302
02:36:01,838 --> 02:36:03,738
lt's not a matter of happiness...

1303
02:36:05,608 --> 02:36:07,576
...but of life.

1304
02:36:10,413 --> 02:36:13,177
There's a world outside the four
walls of the house and office....

1305
02:36:14,350 --> 02:36:18,252
...that l want to know...
A life l want to live.

1306
02:36:20,156 --> 02:36:22,590
l want to realize the dreams
l had the dreams we had dreamed.

1307
02:36:26,295 --> 02:36:27,990
The dreams we had dreamt?

1308
02:36:28,631 --> 02:36:31,930
The dreams you had?
Why have we forgotten them?

1309
02:36:33,636 --> 02:36:37,595
ln these 15 years of marriage,
they got lost somewhere.

1310
02:36:39,308 --> 02:36:42,209
That feeling, love, that excitement,
Where has it all gone?

1311
02:36:43,045 --> 02:36:44,603
Where is it, Seema?

1312
02:36:47,817 --> 02:36:49,614
Where is all that?

1313
02:36:54,390 --> 02:36:56,221
Perhaps time has changed...

1314
02:36:57,393 --> 02:37:00,055
But l love you as much even today.

1315
02:37:04,233 --> 02:37:07,862
Yes, l too had dreams...
Dreams of my own.

1316
02:37:09,972 --> 02:37:14,204
But after meeting you, your
dreams became mine...

1317
02:37:15,278 --> 02:37:17,303
Your life became mine.

1318
02:37:19,248 --> 02:37:23,582
My dream was for you to
get what you wanted.

1319
02:37:26,622 --> 02:37:30,114
l had Rohan and Shai... and you.

1320
02:37:32,295 --> 02:37:35,162
l didn't want anything more from life.

1321
02:37:36,666 --> 02:37:38,190
But l want...

1322
02:37:40,436 --> 02:37:42,063
l want more.

1323
02:37:55,251 --> 02:37:59,119
May you get what you want...

1324
02:38:01,290 --> 02:38:03,190
...that is my only dream even today.

1325
02:38:32,355 --> 02:38:35,119
''ls this love
or punishment?''

1326
02:38:35,725 --> 02:38:37,920
''Tell me, O my heart!''

1327
02:38:39,195 --> 02:38:44,189
''Why doesn't this endless
chain of pain not break?''

1328
02:38:44,667 --> 02:38:50,003
''How many tests and trials
must this love endure?''

1329
02:38:51,407 --> 02:38:56,538
''So many diverse stories
are writ by this love.''

1330
02:38:57,580 --> 02:38:59,548
''O God...''

1331
02:39:00,750 --> 02:39:03,548
''Even if someone lays
down one's life...''

1332
02:39:04,587 --> 02:39:09,251
''lt has no effect at all on the
one so passionately loved.''

1333
02:40:25,301 --> 02:40:30,034
''How arduous is the journey to
reach love's destination !''

1334
02:40:31,674 --> 02:40:36,634
''There are no solutions to
the heart's tribulations.''

1335
02:40:38,681 --> 02:40:42,777
''Every heartbeat
emanates sorrow.''

1336
02:40:45,154 --> 02:40:49,352
''Every breath
breaks restraining bonds.''

1337
02:40:51,427 --> 02:40:56,194
''Every moment somewhere
plaintive lips sigh a complaint.''

1338
02:40:58,300 --> 02:41:03,294
''Someone's world destroys
itself for love.''

1339
02:41:04,306 --> 02:41:06,604
''O God...''

1340
02:41:07,643 --> 02:41:10,203
''Even if someone lays
down one's life...''

1341
02:41:11,347 --> 02:41:15,909
''lt has no effect at all on the
one so passionately loved.''

1342
02:41:42,211 --> 02:41:45,772
Congratulations... on your marriage.

1343
02:41:48,818 --> 02:41:51,150
l'm not getting married.

1344
02:41:54,190 --> 02:41:56,090
lt was all a publicity stunt.

1345
02:41:58,627 --> 02:42:03,291
A plan to get a dream role
in A Karan Johar film.

1346
02:42:09,305 --> 02:42:11,796
Now when the plan is about
to be successful...

1347
02:42:15,144 --> 02:42:17,078
l want something else.

1348
02:42:25,354 --> 02:42:27,618
Even l don't know what l want.

1349
02:42:28,791 --> 02:42:30,782
Why're you telling me all this?

1350
02:42:32,728 --> 02:42:35,288
Because you too don't
know what you want.

1351
02:42:39,468 --> 02:42:42,631
2 O clock at night... alone...

1352
02:42:43,472 --> 02:42:44,962
...distressed...

1353
02:42:46,842 --> 02:42:49,174
You have all the symptoms
of being confused.

1354
02:42:50,446 --> 02:42:53,244
l guess both of us are confused.

1355
02:42:58,320 --> 02:43:04,225
Okay, let's decide who
is more confused.

1356
02:43:07,763 --> 02:43:11,290
How many years have you been married?
12...?

1357
02:43:12,635 --> 02:43:13,761
15.

1358
02:43:16,305 --> 02:43:18,773
Let me guess...two kids...

1359
02:43:19,642 --> 02:43:21,906
A boy and a girl.

1360
02:43:24,847 --> 02:43:26,815
l have met your wife.

1361
02:43:28,651 --> 02:43:30,312
She is very pretty.

1362
02:43:37,092 --> 02:43:39,856
Together in college too...
Then marriage

1363
02:43:40,362 --> 02:43:44,230
Quick rise...well paid job.
Comfortable home in the suburbs.

1364
02:43:53,375 --> 02:43:55,570
Perfect but boring life.

1365
02:43:58,247 --> 02:44:01,011
Then you meet somebody...
ln the office...

1366
02:44:01,317 --> 02:44:04,047
on the street,
bus, train...

1367
02:44:06,388 --> 02:44:07,878
On the train?

1368
02:44:09,625 --> 02:44:16,588
A newness in life...you want
more than what you have.

1369
02:44:19,635 --> 02:44:21,603
You seem to know a lot about me.

1370
02:44:23,639 --> 02:44:30,010
Not about you but l surely
know Miss. Train.

1371
02:44:34,350 --> 02:44:36,614
l understand girls like
her very well...

1372
02:44:40,055 --> 02:44:42,023
Because l too am a girl like them.

1373
02:44:44,793 --> 02:44:46,624
Or perhaps l was...

1374
02:44:49,331 --> 02:44:51,299
Until Rahul came into my life...

1375
02:45:00,609 --> 02:45:02,577
So, Miss. Train...

1376
02:45:02,845 --> 02:45:04,745
She has a name...Anjali.

1377
02:45:05,114 --> 02:45:06,240
Anjali what?

1378
02:45:11,287 --> 02:45:13,255
You don't even know her full name.

1379
02:45:21,430 --> 02:45:25,298
You want to lose what you have...

1380
02:45:29,271 --> 02:45:30,602
For what?

1381
02:45:46,322 --> 02:45:50,622
You want to lose what
you could have had.

1382
02:45:54,463 --> 02:45:55,088
For what?

1383
02:45:55,331 --> 02:45:58,061
''O God...''

1384
02:45:58,600 --> 02:46:01,569
''Even if someone lays
down one's life...''

1385
02:46:02,304 --> 02:46:07,173
''lt has no effect at all on the
one so passionately loved.''

1386
02:46:59,395 --> 02:47:02,762
Yes, it's true Rahul is no more.

1387
02:47:03,632 --> 02:47:05,566
He died in a car accident.

1388
02:47:47,676 --> 02:47:50,304
Rohitji...?
- They've all left for Gia's wedding.

1389
02:47:50,813 --> 02:47:51,939
They've gone?
- Yes.

1390
02:47:52,314 --> 02:47:56,683
''No one hears the sobbing sighs.''

1391
02:47:58,587 --> 02:48:03,547
''No one allays the longing
of tormented arms.''

1392
02:48:05,327 --> 02:48:09,730
''Raging desires only half-slaked.''

1393
02:48:12,301 --> 02:48:16,567
''All hoped for pleasures
shattered into fragments.''

1394
02:48:18,340 --> 02:48:23,277
''Somewhere a seed of suspicion,
elsewhere a wall of hate.''

1395
02:48:25,013 --> 02:48:30,576
''Even in victory
there is loss.''

1396
02:48:31,320 --> 02:48:33,083
''O God...''

1397
02:48:34,623 --> 02:48:37,091
''Even if someone lays
down one's life...''

1398
02:48:38,393 --> 02:48:42,989
''lt has no effect at all on the
one so passionately loved.''

1399
02:48:50,305 --> 02:48:51,932
Where do you have to go?

1400
02:48:53,642 --> 02:48:54,609
l don't know...

1401
02:48:59,248 --> 02:49:01,716
''ls this love or punishment?''

1402
02:49:02,584 --> 02:49:04,882
''Tell me, O my heart!''

1403
02:50:10,352 --> 02:50:14,618
''Don't ask the pain-afflicted...''

1404
02:50:16,858 --> 02:50:21,158
''...what happiness is.
What is laughter.''

1405
02:50:23,332 --> 02:50:28,269
''Hardship hovers over them...''

1406
02:50:30,405 --> 02:50:35,240
''...in some form or other.''

1407
02:50:40,949 --> 02:50:43,247
''O God...''

1408
02:51:28,463 --> 02:51:30,158
Sorry, madam. l dozed off.

1409
02:51:37,439 --> 02:51:38,633
Oh this...?

1410
02:51:39,374 --> 02:51:41,137
l made this for you.

1411
02:51:42,477 --> 02:51:48,074
Give it to your boyfriend
when he says l love you.

1412
02:51:59,328 --> 02:52:01,296
Mamma, l want the window seat.

1413
02:52:13,642 --> 02:52:17,874
Mamma, where's Papa?
- He's not coming with us.

1414
02:53:09,631 --> 02:53:11,895
l just need to talk.

1415
02:53:14,269 --> 02:53:16,066
She is my wife.

1416
02:53:29,684 --> 02:53:34,018
l haven't come to ask
you to forgive me...

1417
02:53:35,457 --> 02:53:38,221
...because what happened
was unforgivable.

1418
02:53:39,361 --> 02:53:41,795
Please don't go.

1419
02:53:45,333 --> 02:53:48,029
What had to happen happened, Vinay.

1420
02:53:48,670 --> 02:53:52,299
Nothing happened, Seema.
Nothing has changed.

1421
02:53:53,408 --> 02:53:56,707
No. Everything has changed.

1422
02:53:58,413 --> 02:54:02,577
lt was you who said... That
love, the excitement...

1423
02:54:05,320 --> 02:54:09,757
l could never give you
what you call life.

1424
02:54:10,325 --> 02:54:13,590
This is not true, Seema.
- Then what is the truth?

1425
02:54:16,698 --> 02:54:18,188
What is the truth?

1426
02:54:19,768 --> 02:54:25,138
The truth is that in all this, l am
left standing like a joke...

1427
02:54:26,308 --> 02:54:32,144
...l, my love, my trust...
everything.

1428
02:54:35,684 --> 02:54:40,781
l am going so that you can get
all that you want from life.

1429
02:54:41,656 --> 02:54:43,749
But you are my life, Seema.

1430
02:54:50,398 --> 02:54:52,263
And this is the only truth.

1431
02:54:53,702 --> 02:54:55,260
The only truth.

1432
02:55:16,291 --> 02:55:17,918
Please don't go, Papa.

1433
02:55:38,647 --> 02:55:40,615
For all of us to go together...

1434
02:55:41,349 --> 02:55:43,317
...l suppose we've to
catch another flight.

1435
02:56:00,735 --> 02:56:02,794
You're all right, aren't you?

1436
02:56:06,608 --> 02:56:08,576
l must put on this act for the world.

1437
02:56:10,312 --> 02:56:12,576
You are a very good actress,
Kkamini....

1438
02:56:13,081 --> 02:56:15,072
...but not that good ...

1439
02:56:16,851 --> 02:56:21,788
l can tell the difference between
real and false tears.

1440
02:56:27,295 --> 02:56:32,597
lt's too late...
l have lost him forever.

1441
02:56:34,836 --> 02:56:39,296
When Kamna was lost, Rahul
searched and found her.

1442
02:56:39,808 --> 02:56:41,935
Because Rahul loved Kamna.

1443
02:56:44,646 --> 02:56:50,141
And now when Rahul is lost,
Kamna will find him...

1444
02:56:50,652 --> 02:56:53,780
...because Kamna loves Rahul.

1445
02:57:02,731 --> 02:57:07,759
Shall l cancel our tickets for the
Delhi-Bombay connecting flight?

1446
02:57:26,321 --> 02:57:28,721
How're you feeling?
Are you okay?

1447
02:57:32,293 --> 02:57:33,920
l am Ashu, Tehzeeb.

1448
02:57:37,999 --> 02:57:39,296
Let me go.

1449
02:57:39,801 --> 02:57:42,269
Listen...
l've to make a call. Please...

1450
02:57:42,771 --> 02:57:44,602
Listen, Tehzeeb.

1451
02:57:46,641 --> 02:57:48,609
l shouldn't have taken you
to my father's house.

1452
02:57:48,843 --> 02:57:50,902
l shouldn't have taken you anywhere

1453
02:57:51,646 --> 02:57:54,877
Listen, Tehzeeb. You are with me.
That's more than enough.

1454
02:57:55,250 --> 02:57:58,549
Come home, Tehzeeb.
- l don't want to go with you.

1455
02:57:59,587 --> 02:58:01,555
l don't want to stay in your house!

1456
02:58:05,260 --> 02:58:07,228
Because l can't bear
to see you like this!

1457
02:58:08,596 --> 02:58:11,190
You always say everything
will be all right...

1458
02:58:12,267 --> 02:58:14,235
But nothing ever is all right.

1459
02:58:16,604 --> 02:58:20,165
You are always searching for
your memory in my eyes.

1460
02:58:21,309 --> 02:58:25,973
And when you don't find it... You
try to act as if it's all fine...

1461
02:58:26,614 --> 02:58:27,911
...perfectly normal.

1462
02:58:31,319 --> 02:58:36,586
You bring me back my smile
and hide your tears.

1463
02:58:39,327 --> 02:58:41,727
l can't bear to see
you suffer like this!

1464
02:58:48,336 --> 02:58:50,201
l want to see you happy.

1465
02:58:52,340 --> 02:58:54,069
But my happiness is with you, Tehzeeb.

1466
02:58:54,409 --> 02:58:59,073
How can it be!
l DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU!

1467
02:59:00,615 --> 02:59:02,947
l need to make a call please...

1468
02:59:05,220 --> 02:59:07,211
Give me your phone... please.

1469
02:59:08,256 --> 02:59:09,951
l must make a call.

1470
02:59:35,717 --> 02:59:37,582
l can't remember...

1471
02:59:54,335 --> 03:00:00,604
Abba, yes. Tehzeeb is all right.
Talk to her.

1472
03:00:14,322 --> 03:00:15,289
Abba...

1473
03:00:16,324 --> 03:00:19,760
Take me away...please!
Take me away.

1474
03:00:53,695 --> 03:00:56,596
l tried so hard to recognize you...

1475
03:00:59,634 --> 03:01:04,003
But nothing... reminds me of you.

1476
03:01:09,644 --> 03:01:11,305
l know, Tehzeeb...

1477
03:01:15,350 --> 03:01:17,250
...you have forgotten me.

1478
03:01:18,686 --> 03:01:21,018
But that your heart has
also forgotten me..

1479
03:01:22,323 --> 03:01:24,052
...is something l can't believe.

1480
03:01:25,360 --> 03:01:27,624
You'll remember everything
one day.

1481
03:01:28,329 --> 03:01:30,092
And if l can't remember?

1482
03:01:32,333 --> 03:01:34,927
What if l can't remember
anything at all?

1483
03:01:36,371 --> 03:01:38,100
We'll create new memories.

1484
03:01:46,481 --> 03:01:48,312
Memories are of life...

1485
03:01:50,485 --> 03:01:52,817
And without you, there's no life.

1486
03:01:55,323 --> 03:01:59,589
What life will you have
with me tomorrow?

1487
03:02:00,328 --> 03:02:02,592
Whatever our tomorrow may be...

1488
03:02:03,798 --> 03:02:06,232
We'll make it beautiful together.

1489
03:02:12,774 --> 03:02:14,901
But if you are not with me...

1490
03:02:15,743 --> 03:02:18,837
Then l have neither
today nor tomorrow.

1491
03:02:23,651 --> 03:02:27,610
Will you give me my tomorrow, Tehzeeb?

1492
03:02:35,330 --> 03:02:38,959
Tell me, Tehzeeb!
Will you give me my tomorrow?

1493
03:03:30,651 --> 03:03:33,745
Shiven, love is what's
there at all times...

1494
03:03:34,689 --> 03:03:39,149
Because love is not about good times
but who you spend time with.

1495
03:03:45,333 --> 03:03:50,032
Whatever our tomorrow may be,
we'll make it beautiful together.

1496
03:03:51,305 --> 03:03:56,572
But if you are not with me, then
l have neither today nor tomorrow.

1497
03:04:04,352 --> 03:04:09,585
Do you know what you are doing, Gia?

1498
03:04:14,228 --> 03:04:14,922
Let's go.

1499
03:04:15,196 --> 03:04:19,155
''Don't ask the pain-afflicted...''

1500
03:04:21,402 --> 03:04:25,771
''...what happiness is.
What is laughter.''

1501
03:04:27,742 --> 03:04:32,611
''Hardship hovers over them...''

1502
03:04:35,083 --> 03:04:39,611
''...in some form or other.''

1503
03:04:43,458 --> 03:04:46,621
''O God...''

1504
03:04:51,666 --> 03:04:54,328
Hail, Mighty Hanuman ! Come, madam.

1505
03:04:58,940 --> 03:05:01,568
What're you saying sorry for! lt'll
be too late if we don't go in.

1506
03:05:06,948 --> 03:05:10,179
We don't have orders, sir.
- So call the person who gives orders.

1507
03:05:10,685 --> 03:05:14,587
Are you the manager here?
- Something like that.

1508
03:05:17,625 --> 03:05:21,152
Why's she going on about invitations!
This girl here...

1509
03:05:21,629 --> 03:05:24,996
...came half-way across the world.
l made her roam all over lndia.

1510
03:05:25,299 --> 03:05:27,995
ln between my Maya darling had
2 punctures and 4 repairs!

1511
03:05:28,302 --> 03:05:30,167
She says lNVlTATlONS!!
And all this for whom?

1512
03:05:30,404 --> 03:05:32,201
That moron of a jackass in there, ha?

1513
03:05:32,640 --> 03:05:35,700
He promised love and marriage to her
and is marrying someone else!

1514
03:05:48,322 --> 03:05:50,313
She is mad enough to
love that jackass.

1515
03:05:50,825 --> 03:05:52,793
But if love isn't mad,
is it any worth, sir?

1516
03:05:53,461 --> 03:05:55,952
And she harangues about invitations!

1517
03:05:58,299 --> 03:06:01,791
You may go in... because madmen
don't need invitations.

1518
03:06:05,306 --> 03:06:06,273
Thank you.

1519
03:06:19,387 --> 03:06:20,581
STOP!

1520
03:06:25,326 --> 03:06:27,055
Stop this wedding!

1521
03:06:33,634 --> 03:06:37,161
l told you, madam. The jackass will
stop his father when he sees you.

1522
03:07:48,376 --> 03:07:51,243
You said get out to madam!
Are you a man or dishrag?

1523
03:07:52,013 --> 03:07:56,109
She left her world and came running
after you. And you spurn her love!

1524
03:07:57,752 --> 03:08:00,243
To opt for hate and reject love
is the worst stupidity.

1525
03:08:00,755 --> 03:08:04,156
lf l were in your place, l'd put
my hand on my heart, close my eyes...

1526
03:08:04,592 --> 03:08:07,220
Take a deep breath
and say l love you !

1527
03:08:44,432 --> 03:08:46,400
l also love you...

1528
03:08:51,339 --> 03:08:53,307
l love you too.

1529
03:09:12,693 --> 03:09:13,751
Shall we...?

1530
03:09:35,416 --> 03:09:36,906
Listen...you goon.

1531
03:09:38,652 --> 03:09:40,586
Swine, cheat, owl...

1532
03:09:41,322 --> 03:09:43,222
Ruin and damnation upon you.

1533
03:09:45,626 --> 03:09:48,595
Your son is jackass no.1.

1534
03:09:49,864 --> 03:09:53,766
Dimwit of an owl who doesn't
know what love means.

1535
03:09:56,303 --> 03:09:56,598
Go to...

1536
03:10:00,408 --> 03:10:02,603
Go to hell... all of you !

1537
03:10:04,845 --> 03:10:06,813
Go to hell...all of you !

1538
03:10:12,887 --> 03:10:15,788
What are you looking at me for?
Read the wedding mantras.

1539
03:10:18,359 --> 03:10:20,088
Bakshiji, shall we start?

1540
03:10:30,471 --> 03:10:31,631
Please start.

1541
03:10:49,790 --> 03:10:50,779
STOP!

1542
03:10:54,695 --> 03:10:55,593
Let go.

1543
03:10:57,298 --> 03:10:58,595
This...?

1544
03:11:00,801 --> 03:11:02,234
Stop this wedding?

1545
03:11:02,736 --> 03:11:04,601
Stop this wedding!

1546
03:11:10,344 --> 03:11:12,972
Sir, hadn't l told you? When two people
truly love each other...

1547
03:11:13,247 --> 03:11:14,942
they do get together.

1548
03:11:16,650 --> 03:11:20,177
l can't find the words...
But all the best.

1549
03:11:40,407 --> 03:11:42,705
l am getting married, Shiven !

1550
03:11:44,445 --> 03:11:48,279
Why's the wedding going on?
l mean why are you getting married?

1551
03:11:49,783 --> 03:11:53,310
Why shouldn't l get married?
- Get married. Most certainly.

1552
03:11:53,888 --> 03:11:56,982
But why him?
- Why not him?

1553
03:12:09,403 --> 03:12:11,371
l have to marry someone
or other, don't l?

1554
03:12:11,805 --> 03:12:13,602
Yes. But not him, someone else.

1555
03:12:14,141 --> 03:12:15,108
Whom?

1556
03:12:17,344 --> 03:12:18,311
Me.

1557
03:12:19,914 --> 03:12:25,614
There l said it. No side-tracking.

1558
03:12:27,254 --> 03:12:28,949
You must marry me.

1559
03:12:29,323 --> 03:12:30,290
Why?

1560
03:12:31,358 --> 03:12:33,326
Because today l realise ...

1561
03:12:34,361 --> 03:12:39,230
Love is not about good times
but who you spend time with.

1562
03:12:40,834 --> 03:12:45,237
Gia, l now know...
Whatever our tomorrow may be...

1563
03:12:46,807 --> 03:12:48,798
We'll make it beautiful together.

1564
03:12:50,411 --> 03:12:57,044
But if you are not with me, then
l have neither today nor tomorrow.

1565
03:13:10,798 --> 03:13:13,767
l know l'm late every time but today...
- Today...

1566
03:13:16,303 --> 03:13:21,036
lf you were late today,
l'd have really killed you !

1567
03:13:36,056 --> 03:13:37,751
Panditji, you may begin.

1568
03:13:38,058 --> 03:13:39,753
Wait! Bakshi Saheb...

1569
03:13:47,468 --> 03:13:50,198
Bloody... brighter!

1570
03:13:51,672 --> 03:13:54,038
Panditji, what are you looking
at me for? Start the ceremony.

1571
03:13:56,076 --> 03:13:58,169
This is simply not done!
Every one here...

1572
03:13:58,612 --> 03:14:00,170
Why don't you do something, Paaji?
- No, sir.

1573
03:14:00,614 --> 03:14:03,583
When man and wife agree, can
a mere Paaji dare disagree!

1574
03:14:04,018 --> 03:14:06,179
Panditji, finish the ceremony.

1575
03:14:27,641 --> 03:14:30,838
Sir, where are you going?
- We came to meet Rahul, l told you !

1576
03:14:31,345 --> 03:14:33,074
He'll be somewhere here.

1577
03:15:43,884 --> 03:15:45,613
So...you did come.

1578
03:15:47,387 --> 03:15:49,014
l have come.

1579
03:15:49,323 --> 03:15:51,086
So, you did find me.

1580
03:15:52,326 --> 03:15:53,293
l found you.

1581
03:15:53,660 --> 03:15:54,627
Cheque?

1582
03:15:56,230 --> 03:15:57,197
Cheque...?

1583
03:15:57,598 --> 03:15:59,566
10 million. You brought
the cheque, didn't you?

1584
03:16:00,901 --> 03:16:03,563
l forgot. You forgot too?

1585
03:16:08,776 --> 03:16:12,109
You love playing games don't you?
- But not more than you.

1586
03:16:12,646 --> 03:16:15,581
All right.
So let's begin.

1587
03:16:19,620 --> 03:16:25,183
lf l said l don't have a cheque
for 10 million...

1588
03:16:26,293 --> 03:16:28,887
...but loads of love for you...
Then?

1589
03:16:31,965 --> 03:16:33,592
lf l said...

1590
03:16:42,643 --> 03:16:43,610
Then...?

1591
03:16:49,349 --> 03:16:53,183
lf the phone rings exactly
at that time...

1592
03:17:02,596 --> 03:17:04,564
And it is Karan Johar calling.

1593
03:17:06,300 --> 03:17:07,267
Then...?

1594
03:17:09,770 --> 03:17:12,170
And you have become Karan
Johar's heroine...

1595
03:17:15,309 --> 03:17:19,268
Kkamini's dream isn't a dream
anymore but a reality.

1596
03:17:22,616 --> 03:17:23,583
Then...?

1597
03:17:29,256 --> 03:17:32,157
l am Karan Johar speaking.

1598
03:17:33,193 --> 03:17:37,254
l have some good news.
- Wrong number.

1599
03:17:42,302 --> 03:17:46,602
Now... will Rahul marry Kamna?

1600
03:17:47,908 --> 03:17:51,901
Good technique
to split 10 million in two.

1601
03:18:00,354 --> 03:18:04,552
Accept love's sweet salute,
my darling.

1602
03:18:05,726 --> 03:18:10,891
Just commit the folly
of loving me back.

1603
03:18:11,365 --> 03:18:13,060
My heart is restless...

1604
03:18:13,367 --> 03:18:15,062
My heart is restless...

1605
03:18:15,369 --> 03:18:17,234
My heart is restless...

1606
03:20:20,127 --> 03:20:21,321
lf not the first year...

1607
03:20:21,828 --> 03:20:23,796
l've to give you something at
least the second year, don't l?

1608
