1
00:00:00,725 --> 00:00:02,969
Hey, Mr. Shue, it's Rachel,
how are you?

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,186
Rachel, hey, good.

3
00:00:04,221 --> 00:00:06,472
Yeah, just, uh, getting ready
for regionals.

4
00:00:06,523 --> 00:00:08,140
Well, I wanted you to be
the first that I told...

5
00:00:08,191 --> 00:00:10,643
even before Kurt, before
my dads, or even before Finn...

6
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,312
that I had my callback
for <i>Funny Girl</i> this morning.

7
00:00:13,363 --> 00:00:14,614
Wait, did you get Fanny Brice?

8
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:15,681
Not yet, but it's between me

9
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,316
and two other girls.

10
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:18,868
Oh, that is
incredible news, Rachel.

11
00:00:18,902 --> 00:00:20,119
Y-You're a shoo-in.

12
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:22,738
Aw, I just want you to know
that if it does happen,

13
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:23,956
it's because of you.

14
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:26,325
Well, if, if I contributed
even a little bit...

15
00:00:26,376 --> 00:00:28,294
Well, you contributed
more than a little.

16
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:31,080
I sang "Don't Stop Believin'"
for my audition,

17
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,966
and when I sang it,
I thought about that first week

18
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:35,751
that we were all in Glee Club

19
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,553
and how amazing
we all were together,

20
00:00:37,588 --> 00:00:39,655
and it just brought back
so many emotions,

21
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,341
it made my performance
so powerful,

22
00:00:42,392 --> 00:00:45,011
and, well, you were the one that
put that all together, so...

23
00:00:45,062 --> 00:00:46,012
(sighs)

24
00:00:46,063 --> 00:00:47,980
You okay, Mr. Shue?

25
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:49,815
Yeah, fine, just allergies.

26
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,684
(chuckles)

27
00:00:51,735 --> 00:00:52,985
(sighs)

28
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,822
Rachel... I'm so proud of you.

29
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:58,908
Y-You're one of our biggest
success stories,

30
00:00:58,942 --> 00:01:01,327
a-and no matter what happens
with <i>Funny Girl,</i>

31
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,663
I mean, you're in New York,
you're living your dream.

32
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:04,914
Not many people can say that.

33
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:06,165
I know,

34
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:10,369
it's a special
and wonderful thing, so...

35
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,837
And when I'm at Radio City

36
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:14,840
and I'm accepting my Tony Award
and I forget to thank you, well,

37
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,342
thank you.

38
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:17,510
Thank you.

39
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:18,761
(phone beeps off)

40
00:01:18,795 --> 00:01:21,547
(sighs)

41
00:01:21,598 --> 00:01:23,549
Wonderful.

42
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,520
All right, guys, I just got
some wonderful news from Rachel.

43
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:29,689
She's got a second callback
for <i>Funny Girl.</i>

44
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:32,024
(cheering)

45
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:34,193
And that's not
our only good news.

46
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:36,062
Brittany is at M.I.T.
touring the campus

47
00:01:36,113 --> 00:01:38,230
because she's got
an early acceptance.

48
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:39,231
That can't be true.

49
00:01:39,282 --> 00:01:41,784
And I re-proposed
to Emma.

50
00:01:41,818 --> 00:01:44,370
She reaccepted, and we're
getting married after regionals.

51
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:45,788
Yay!
We're excited.

52
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:48,541
I've got good news, too.

53
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,743
I'm wait-listed at the Columbus
College of Veterinary Medicine.

54
00:01:50,794 --> 00:01:52,461
It's a fallback
if I don't pursue acting.

55
00:01:52,496 --> 00:01:53,546
Bless her heart.

56
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,214
WILL: Tina, that's
not just good news.

57
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:56,916
It's wonderful,

58
00:01:56,967 --> 00:01:58,751
and that's what this
week is all about.

59
00:01:58,802 --> 00:02:01,003
We're taking a lesson from one
of the greatest musical artists

60
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,221
of all time.

61
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,473
Despite facing a ton of
obstacles,

62
00:02:04,508 --> 00:02:06,425
he's a living example
of embracing...

63
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:09,895
n-n-no, <i>celebrating...</i>
joy and optimism,

64
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,314
and he's collected
25 Grammys along the way.

65
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:14,233
So don't you worry 'bout a thing

66
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,102
because whether you're
ebony or ivory,

67
00:02:16,153 --> 00:02:18,437
you are the sunshine of my life.

68
00:02:18,488 --> 00:02:20,239
Yes. And next week at
regionals we will be

69
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,241
jammin' on higher ground.

70
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,826
Yay!

71
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,245
Yeah-yeah,
it's a Stevie Wonder week.

72
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,780
(cheering)

73
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:28,964
(laughter)

75
00:02:31,422 --> 00:02:32,000
(school bell ringing)

76
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:33,969
Hey, Crippy
Longstocking, wait up.

77
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:35,354
You know what?
That's offensive.

78
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:36,355
Aw, boo hoo.

79
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,473
I have a disability, too.

80
00:02:37,507 --> 00:02:38,507
My disability is
that I can't tell

81
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:39,642
when something's offensive,

82
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:41,510
and for you to point
that out is bullying.

83
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,512
Care to share why
you're so depressed?

84
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,031
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

85
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:46,065
Nice try, liar.

86
00:02:46,116 --> 00:02:47,533
You're depressed
and I know why.

87
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,535
When the girls were performing
during Guilty Pleasures Week,

88
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,821
you used those googly,
thyroid-conditioned eyeballs

89
00:02:51,855 --> 00:02:55,157
of yours and ogled me like I
was a Taiwanese streetwalker.

90
00:02:55,191 --> 00:02:56,492
Well, I regret to inform you

91
00:02:56,526 --> 00:02:59,161
that you will never be
climbing all up on this.

92
00:02:59,195 --> 00:03:00,713
Actually that's not
what I was upset about,

93
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,248
but thank you for giving me
something else

94
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:04,032
to make me depressed.
Aha!

95
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:05,868
I knew you were depressed
about something.

96
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,753
Yesterday when I got home,

97
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:09,388
there was an envelope
waiting for me,

98
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:11,340
and inside was the news
that I got accepted

99
00:03:11,374 --> 00:03:12,842
into the Brooklyn Film Academy.

100
00:03:12,876 --> 00:03:13,876
Wait, are you serious?

101
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,927
Yes, actually I am.

102
00:03:14,978 --> 00:03:16,712
But you know what?
I'm not going.

103
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,847
Why?

104
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:19,515
Believe it or not,
I don't want to talk about it,

105
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:21,767
and I'd appreciate it
if you didn't tell anyone.

106
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,574
(school bell ringing)

107
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:34,196
KURT: <i>Two more days until Dad</i>
<i>gets his test results.</i>

108
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,231
<i>Either all of the stuff</i>
<i>the doctors have been doing</i>

109
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,734
<i>has worked and he's cancer free</i>
<i>or it hasn't.</i>

110
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,937
<i>I have to be there</i>
<i>for the appointment</i>

111
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,906
<i>mostly to translate for Dad.</i>

112
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,708
<i>Why do perfectly intelligent</i>
<i>parents become</i>

113
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:47,910
<i>completely unreliable when</i>
<i>they have to go to the doctor?</i>

114
00:03:47,944 --> 00:03:49,912
<i>I'm only packing</i>
<i>light blue socks</i>

115
00:03:49,946 --> 00:03:51,881
<i>because light blue is</i>
<i>the color of clear skies,</i>

116
00:03:51,915 --> 00:03:53,115
<i>and that's what I'm hoping for.</i>

117
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,384
<i>Yes, I'm getting a little OCD</i>

118
00:03:55,418 --> 00:03:56,886
<i>leading up to this appointment.</i>

119
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,721
<i>Rachel said it was</i>
<i>a natural response,</i>

120
00:03:58,755 --> 00:04:00,956
<i>just me looking to control</i>
<i>my anxiety in some way.</i>

121
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,793
<i>I figure I need to cut myself</i>
<i>some slack.</i>

122
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,961
<i>So what if I have</i>
<i>a few new rituals</i>

123
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,563
<i>to get me through the day?</i>

124
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:09,131
<i>Oh, crap, it's 4:14.</i>

125
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,933
<i>I touch my nose three times</i>

126
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:12,935
<i>at 14 and 28 past the hour</i>
<i>for good luck.</i>

127
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:14,303
(sighs)

128
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,238
<i>I know every kid is scared</i>
<i>of losing their dad,</i>

129
00:04:16,273 --> 00:04:17,873
<i>but he's the only thing</i>
<i>that got me</i>

130
00:04:17,908 --> 00:04:19,708
<i>through my mom dying,</i>

131
00:04:19,743 --> 00:04:21,610
<i>and if I have to say good-bye</i>
<i>to him, too,</i>

132
00:04:21,645 --> 00:04:24,380
<i>well, I'm not going</i>
<i>to think about it.</i>

133
00:04:24,414 --> 00:04:27,550
(school bell ringing)

134
00:04:27,584 --> 00:04:29,418
<i>Coming back for Dad is also</i>
<i>a perfect excuse</i>

135
00:04:29,452 --> 00:04:30,886
<i>to come see everyone...</i>

136
00:04:30,921 --> 00:04:33,222
<i>and Blaine, of course.</i>

137
00:04:33,256 --> 00:04:35,057
<i>Don't worry,</i>
<i>we're not hooking up this time.</i>

138
00:04:35,091 --> 00:04:38,427
<i>Feels weird seeing him,</i>
<i>still, but not as weird.</i>

139
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:41,063
<i>I can't tell if that makes me</i>
<i>feel sad or not.</i>

140
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:43,432
<i>At least I know I won't have</i>
<i>to face this all alone.</i>

141
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:45,768
<i>Lucky for me, there are a few</i>
<i>other people in town this week</i>

142
00:04:45,802 --> 00:04:46,902
<i>to walk alongside me.</i>

143
00:04:46,937 --> 00:04:48,237

to celebrate Artie getting his
acceptance letter into film school.

186

Well, you know, that may have
been the perfect song,

190
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,070
but that performance
was just one package

191
00:07:01,104 --> 00:07:02,571
that I'm not signing for.

192
00:07:02,605 --> 00:07:04,740
I mean, honestly, it was good,
but you guys have got

193
00:07:04,774 --> 00:07:06,742
to be great for regionals.

194
00:07:06,776 --> 00:07:08,410
Yeah, clearly we should be
taking our advice

195
00:07:08,445 --> 00:07:10,446
from someone

Thanks, Tina.

gave you a big shout-out

have a lot to be proud of.

my whole life, and it's

in the big city all alone.

wheel-friendly

Duh, I'm trying to be wonderful.

I like to switch it
up, be unpredictable.

and fast and furious,
but also soulful

262
00:09:14,904 --> 00:09:16,355
and smooth, but like "smoov,"

263
00:09:16,406 --> 00:09:18,107
you know, like
smooth with a "V."

ing on between you two?

280
00:09:46,536 --> 00:09:48,770
Because it was pretty
boy-on-boy heavy

281
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,289
at the wedding.
We're not together.

282
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,907

really important right now?

286

297
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:28,827
Who told you guys about that?

298
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:30,496

303
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:40,172
No, that's impossible.
First of all,

304
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,656
she's on <i>Bunheads,</i>
and she has the wrong nose.

305
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,175
This would be
during her hiatus,

306
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,626
and word around Shubert Alley

307
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,794
is she's looking
into prosthetics,

308
00:10:45,828 --> 00:10:47,162

00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,168
Point is, you better
bring your A game,

314
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,854
hope no one tells Cassandra

315

about your extracurricular
activities.

316
00:10:57,673 --> 00:10:59,174
Why? NYADA's students
are allowed

317
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,526
to explore outside
acting opportunities.

318
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,643
Technically,

319
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:03,011
but you need a teacher
to sign of.

320
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,512
And Cassie July's been
looking for a reason

321
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:06,481
to destroy and expel you
since day one.

322
00:11:06,515 --> 00:11:07,849
So from where we're standing,

323
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,568
you're not just risking
humiliation at the hands

324
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:11,703
of one of the Streep girls
by going after Fanny...

325
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:13,521
You're also risking
the Greek-like wrath

326
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,689
of Cassandra July.

327
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,875
But don't worry,
we sincerely doubt

328
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,693
Cassie July's trolling
the Broadway chat rooms,

329
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,029
keeping tabs
on her most hated student.

330
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,173
Just confirmed, Rachel Berry
is a finalist for Fanny Brice.

We thought you'd want to know

332
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,559
and pray this wins
us your favor.

333
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:35,577
Mm.

334
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:39,072
Alright everybody,

335
00:11:39,108 --> 00:11:41,259
let's give it up for Island Beetz
recording artist extraordinaire,

336
00:11:41,293 --> 00:11:43,628
Mercedes Jones.
(cheers and applause)

337
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,601
All right, all right.
Now, I know that Kurt

338
00:11:49,635 --> 00:11:50,969
is going through a lot
this week,

339
00:11:50,987 --> 00:11:52,103
but in spite of that,

340
00:11:52,137 --> 00:11:54,272
we are all very happy
to be here.

341
00:11:54,306 --> 00:11:57,108
As you may remember,
we saw you guys at sectionals,

342
00:11:57,142 --> 00:11:58,443

For instance, Marley.

345
00:12:01,814 --> 00:12:04,165
You have got killer vocals,

346
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,167
homegirl, so why is it

347
00:12:06,202 --> 00:12:08,787
that I've never heard you do a
Mercedes Jones-style vocal run?

348
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:11,289
I don't know. I-I guess
I've just been scared to try.

349
00:12:11,323 --> 00:12:13,708
Exactly. You're scared
to belt it out.

350
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:15,126
And you're probably afraid

351
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,630
that when you do, I'm gonna test
your breath control

352
00:12:18,664 --> 00:12:22,133
by hitting you in the
solar plexus with this maraca.

353
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:24,803

to do a little runnin' with.

See? If you had
better breath control,

358
00:12:35,347 --> 00:12:38,316
you could probably hold
that note every time.

360

your light under a bushel."

under your flannel.

431
00:16:00,118 --> 00:16:02,003
All right, I asked you
not to wear dark colors.

432
00:16:02,054 --> 00:16:03,888
Okay, dark blue
is close to black,

433
00:16:03,923 --> 00:16:05,340

for sure, okay?

437
00:16:09,728 --> 00:16:11,563

to do one thing.

and sit down?

00:16:18,938 --> 00:16:20,772
Hey, Doc,

441
00:16:20,806 --> 00:16:22,106
what's the good word?
You know,

442
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,691
I'm gonna skip the cliches
about my golf game

443
00:16:23,742 --> 00:16:26,611
and get right to it.
As you know, we were

444
00:16:26,645 --> 00:16:28,279
mildly aggressive
with your treatment

445
00:16:28,313 --> 00:16:29,914
considering you were still
in stage I.

446
00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:32,283
We used implant
radiation therapy.

447
00:16:32,317 --> 00:16:34,035
And he completely
changed his diet.

448
00:16:34,086 --> 00:16:35,453
Well, whatever you were doing,
it worked.

449
00:16:35,487 --> 00:16:37,455
The tumor's gone.
What?

450
00:16:37,489 --> 00:16:40,291

normal, and you have the prostate

453
00:16:43,762 --> 00:16:45,129
you're saying he's cured?

but in layman's terms, yeah.

Things aren't finished, right?

464
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,571

How you doing?
What's up, Blaine?

483
00:17:44,969 --> 00:17:46,603
KURT: Well, it's
probably not a surprise

484
00:17:46,637 --> 00:17:47,804
why I asked you
to come here today.

485
00:17:47,822 --> 00:17:50,107
I'm guessing it has
something to do with a song?

486
00:17:50,141 --> 00:17:51,641
Yes. But not just any song.

487
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:53,477
See, the last time
I dedicated a song

488
00:17:53,495 --> 00:17:55,645
to you in this room,
you were in the hospital.

489
00:17:55,663 --> 00:17:58,248
But today we are celebrating
life's most treasured

490
00:17:58,283 --> 00:17:59,833
and wonderful gift...

491
00:17:59,868 --> 00:18:01,285
a second chance.

492
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,753
See, when I was little,
you used to sing

493
00:18:02,787 --> 00:18:04,154
this song to me
in the car all the time

494
00:18:04,172 --> 00:18:06,290
and it always put
a smile on my face.

495
00:18:06,324 --> 00:18:08,509
So today it's my turn to sing,

496
00:18:08,543 --> 00:18:09,760
and your turn to smile.

497
00:18:09,794 --> 00:18:11,661

(Burt whoops)

524
00:20:04,242 --> 00:20:05,442
Whoa!

525
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,743
Yeah!

526
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:09,046
(exhales)

527
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,998
Thank you so much.

528
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:17,387
...I've had a lot of experience,
honest!

529
00:20:17,422 --> 00:20:18,722
Why, I've been on the stage
since I was ten,

530
00:20:18,756 --> 00:20:19,956
amateur contests,

531
00:20:19,974 --> 00:20:21,475
Gottlieb's Southern
Repertory...

532
00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:23,894
Well, well, if it isn't
Little Miss David Schwimmer.

533
00:20:23,928 --> 00:20:26,396
I'm sorry, I thought
that I reserved this room.

534
00:20:26,431 --> 00:20:28,398
So you could stare at yourself
in the mirror

535
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:31,768
and run lines for your
<i>Funny Girl</i> callback?

536
00:20:32,803 --> 00:20:34,571
You know this
isn't normal, right?

537
00:20:34,606 --> 00:20:36,573
Running lines in the mirror

538
00:20:36,608 --> 00:20:38,909
isn't a typical step
in the acting process.

539
00:20:38,943 --> 00:20:41,078
Actors less narcissistic
than yourself

540
00:20:41,112 --> 00:20:44,414
actually prefer to rehearse
with other actors.

541
00:20:44,449 --> 00:20:45,616
Who told you about my callback?

542
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,652
Barbra Streisand,
a very close personal friend.

543
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,253
See, I ran into her at Target,

544
00:20:50,288 --> 00:20:52,089
and then in passing
she just said

545
00:20:52,123 --> 00:20:54,091
that a NYADA freshman
who looked like a troll

546
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,293
was slated to read
for producers on Wednesday.

547
00:20:56,327 --> 00:20:58,211
And then I thought to myself,

548
00:20:58,262 --> 00:20:59,829
"Babs can't be talking
about Schwimmer.

549
00:20:59,847 --> 00:21:02,633
Schwimmer has her dance
midterm that day."

550
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:04,184
Please, Ms. July...
Mm-hmm?

551
00:21:04,218 --> 00:21:06,336
I cannot miss
this callback, okay?

552
00:21:06,354 --> 00:21:08,438
This is a once in
a lifetime opportunity...

553
00:21:08,473 --> 00:21:10,641
Right. I wouldn't dream
of you missing it.

554
00:21:10,675 --> 00:21:13,944
It's a once in a lifetime
opportunity for me, too.

555
00:21:13,978 --> 00:21:15,779
And I plan on attending
that callback.

556
00:21:15,813 --> 00:21:17,681
Because you have
a tendency to choke

557
00:21:17,699 --> 00:21:20,450
under pressure, and so
I'm going to be there...

558
00:21:20,485 --> 00:21:23,954
with Barbra and her husband,
James Brolin...

559
00:21:23,988 --> 00:21:27,124
to watch you blow your first
big Broadway audition.

560
00:21:27,158 --> 00:21:29,526
In the meantime, I'm gonna change
your midterm to tomorrow morning.

561
00:21:29,544 --> 00:21:30,794
What?
You heard me, David.

562
00:21:30,828 --> 00:21:34,131
6:00 a.m. tomorrow morning,
you will perform the solo

563
00:21:34,165 --> 00:21:36,133
of the second act of
Balanchine's

564
00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:38,535
1941 masterpiece
"Concerto Barocco,"

565
00:21:38,553 --> 00:21:40,003
(thunder crashing)
which is widely regarded

566
00:21:40,037 --> 00:21:43,306
as the most difficult ballet
routine ever devised,

567
00:21:43,341 --> 00:21:45,208
while you're widely regarded

568
00:21:45,226 --> 00:21:47,477
as of having one of
the puffiest

569
00:21:47,512 --> 00:21:51,815
morning faces
of any known human.

570
00:21:51,849 --> 00:21:53,850
It's gonna be
a great combination.

571
00:22:00,525 --> 00:22:01,725
(school bell rings)

572
00:22:01,743 --> 00:22:03,893
Since this week is
about wonderful things,

573
00:22:03,911 --> 00:22:05,996
I want to celebrate
a wonderful talent.

574
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:08,498
He's new to Glee Club this year,
but I think if we all

575
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:09,833
help him with his confidence,

576
00:22:09,867 --> 00:22:11,234
he can lead us
all the way to nationals.

577
00:22:11,252 --> 00:22:14,004
(Stevie Wonder's "I Wish"
starts to play)

578
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:17,741

your butt up here, Jake!

is an attorney

and we will sue you

00:24:54,899 --> 00:24:56,149
right back.

00:24:56,183 --> 00:24:58,235

Just my useless "producer."

657
00:25:07,612 --> 00:25:08,695
I thought you liked him.

658
00:25:08,746 --> 00:25:09,696
I did.

659
00:25:09,747 --> 00:25:11,331

660

♪ Whoa-oh.

661
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,871
I'd say let's have
another go, Mercedes,

662
00:25:17,922 --> 00:25:19,339
but honestly, your voice

663
00:25:19,373 --> 00:25:20,590
was perfection.

664
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:22,292
So, let's move on

665
00:25:22,326 --> 00:25:23,510
if we can, please.

666

668
00:25:27,765 --> 00:25:29,883
Could you just lean forward
a bit there, Mercedes?

669
00:25:31,102 --> 00:25:32,269
And drop that shoulder wrap.

670
00:25:32,303 --> 00:25:33,937

comfortable with that,

00:25:33,971 --> 00:25:35,004
Martin.

672
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,890
You look like a girl

00:25:36,941 --> 00:25:38,058
going to church or the prom.

674
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:39,192

who needs to move 100,000 units

676
00:25:41,145 --> 00:25:43,613
just to make a minor splash
in this marketplace.

677
00:25:43,648 --> 00:25:45,198
This is the look.

678
00:25:45,232 --> 00:25:46,900
This is what I'm wearing.

679
00:25:46,951 --> 00:25:48,068
All right.

680
00:25:49,153 --> 00:25:50,870
You heard the lady.

681
00:25:50,905 --> 00:25:52,205
She's the boss.

682
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:53,657
Now they're saying my CD

683
00:25:53,691 --> 00:25:55,041
is off of their
release schedule

684
00:25:55,076 --> 00:25:57,377
until I agree to another photo shoot.
(sighs)

685
00:25:57,411 --> 00:25:59,212
One showing more skin.

686
00:25:59,246 --> 00:26:00,747
What? Screw him.

687
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:02,132
Oh, and he said he'd be happy

688
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:03,133
to use another girl's picture.

689
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:04,217
On your CD?

690
00:26:04,251 --> 00:26:05,752
The one that you
are singing on?

691
00:26:05,803 --> 00:26:06,803
Oh, hell to the no.

692
00:26:06,837 --> 00:26:08,338
They don't want me.

693
00:26:08,372 --> 00:26:09,756
They just want my voice,

694
00:26:09,807 --> 00:26:10,890
not my whole person.

695
00:26:10,925 --> 00:26:12,559
You know, it's crazy, guys.

696
00:26:12,593 --> 00:26:13,727
I'm going to be

697
00:26:13,761 --> 00:26:17,013
dealing with this
the rest of my career.

698
00:26:17,047 --> 00:26:18,431
Everyone is gonna
want me to look

699
00:26:18,482 --> 00:26:20,817
like Beyoncé, and no one
is gonna be satisfied

700
00:26:20,851 --> 00:26:23,103
with me, Mercedes Jones.

701
00:26:23,154 --> 00:26:24,571
And they're crazy, and
you don't want to be

702
00:26:24,605 --> 00:26:25,939
in business with
people like that.

703
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,941
You're not actually
considering it, are you?

704
00:26:27,992 --> 00:26:30,660
I've been working on
this album for a year.

705
00:26:30,695 --> 00:26:32,996
I need it to come out.

706
00:26:34,448 --> 00:26:36,166
Look, I'm sorry, guys.

707
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,917
I don't what I'm gonna do,

708
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:40,453
but I need to talk to my mom
about this hot mess.

709
00:26:42,873 --> 00:26:45,074
(sighs)

710
00:26:51,072 --> 00:26:53,524
Mom, I'm home.

711
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:54,758
Hi, Artie.

712
00:26:54,776 --> 00:26:56,560
Yeah, hey, Artie.

713
00:26:59,647 --> 00:27:02,116
Guess I beat you here,
and I guess I beat

714
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,218
you to telling your
mom about your good news.

715
00:27:04,252 --> 00:27:07,454
Honey, why would you hide
something like that from me?

716
00:27:07,489 --> 00:27:09,289
So much for your lies.

717
00:27:09,324 --> 00:27:11,608
Your mom's completely
on board with you going

718
00:27:11,626 --> 00:27:13,410
to Brooklyn Film Academy,
by the way.

719
00:27:13,444 --> 00:27:15,245
I thought you were
a lot of things,

720
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,114
but I didn't peg you
for a wuss.

721
00:27:17,132 --> 00:27:19,833
I guess you two have
a lot to talk about.

722
00:27:23,454 --> 00:27:24,722
(door opens, closes) All right,

723
00:27:24,756 --> 00:27:27,224
why would you tell people
that I'm afraid

724
00:27:27,258 --> 00:27:28,809
to let you go to New York?

725
00:27:30,261 --> 00:27:32,062
Because I'm afraid to go, okay?

726
00:27:32,097 --> 00:27:34,815
I just thought it'd be easier
to blame it on you.

727
00:27:34,849 --> 00:27:37,818
Well, you've never been afraid
of anything in your life.

728
00:27:37,852 --> 00:27:39,136
Because my life has been
pretty sheltered.

729
00:27:39,154 --> 00:27:41,071
Because you built that
ramp that I just rolled down

730
00:27:41,106 --> 00:27:42,573
so I could get
in the living room.

731
00:27:42,607 --> 00:27:44,408
Because you converted the den
into my bedroom

732
00:27:44,442 --> 00:27:46,143
so I didn't have to go upstairs.

733
00:27:46,161 --> 00:27:47,745
Because you built that
bathroom add-on...

734
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:49,413
Artie, <i>you</i> did those things.

735
00:27:49,447 --> 00:27:51,915
They were all your suggestions.

736
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:54,334
I didn't know how
to handle your needs.

737
00:27:54,369 --> 00:27:58,005
So you adapted and you will
adapt in New York.

738
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:00,841
So what's the real reason
you don't want to go?

739
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:03,427
I don't want to leave you alone.

740
00:28:03,461 --> 00:28:05,095
Ever since the accident,

741
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,598
you've devoted every spare
moment to taking care of me.

742
00:28:07,632 --> 00:28:09,433
And it just feels selfish

743
00:28:09,467 --> 00:28:12,019
that the thanks I give
is packing up and leaving.

744
00:28:12,053 --> 00:28:14,271
Oh, honey,
that's exactly what I want.

745
00:28:14,305 --> 00:28:16,106
You have been dreaming
about making movies

746
00:28:16,141 --> 00:28:18,776
since you were a kid.

747
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,060
You're going.

748
00:28:21,813 --> 00:28:23,280
I love you.

749
00:28:23,314 --> 00:28:25,182
I love you, too.

750
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:31,905
And if you ever imply again
that I'm an old hag...

751
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,324
...I'm gonna tip you over.

752
00:28:35,543 --> 00:28:37,161
Right.

753
00:28:41,332 --> 00:28:43,467
Going to New York.

754
00:28:43,501 --> 00:28:45,169
I don't know what
to say, Schwimmer,

755
00:28:45,203 --> 00:28:46,536
I'm in a hell of a mood today.

756
00:28:46,554 --> 00:28:50,007
So when you do inevitably
faceflop like a ragdoll,

757
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:52,392
at least, I don't know,

758
00:28:52,427 --> 00:28:53,510
try to make me laugh.

759
00:28:53,544 --> 00:28:54,645
You know what?

760
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:56,146
You've been wrong
about me all year,

761
00:28:56,181 --> 00:28:58,232
and you're gonna be
wrong about me again.

762
00:29:04,022 --> 00:29:05,889
What's this?

763
00:29:05,907 --> 00:29:07,357
This is your midterm.

764
00:29:08,693 --> 00:29:09,827
I don't understand.

765
00:29:09,861 --> 00:29:12,746
This is NYADA. We are
the best of the best,

766
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,332
and make no mistake,
will crush you

767
00:29:15,366 --> 00:29:16,834
to get the role ourselves.

768
00:29:16,868 --> 00:29:19,503
But we are also family,

769
00:29:19,537 --> 00:29:21,371
we get through it together,

770
00:29:21,405 --> 00:29:23,757
and we celebrate each other
when there's big news.

771
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:27,211
And this is big news.

772
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:31,014
You've danced your way
through the fire all year,

773
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:33,517
and you're still standing tall.

774
00:29:33,551 --> 00:29:36,937
So we are gonna get you through
this midterm

775
00:29:36,971 --> 00:29:40,423
so you can go kick
some NYADA ass

776
00:29:40,441 --> 00:29:43,560
at your first
big Broadway callback!

Oh, my God, I was so surprise.

813
00:31:59,063 --> 00:32:02,366
(excited chattering)

814
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,141
(excited chattering)

815
00:32:14,723 --> 00:32:17,392
All right, everyone.

816
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,494
Ah, all right. Sit down.

817
00:32:21,664 --> 00:32:24,282
So, today's lesson...

818
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:27,118
Well, I was gonna say "truth,"

819
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:28,370
but it's about this
crazy-ass business

820
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,338
that a lot of us
want to get into.

821
00:32:30,373 --> 00:32:32,457
If you're gonna tell us to not
even try 'cause it's too hard...

822
00:32:32,508 --> 00:32:34,409
No, no, I'm just saying
be ready.

823
00:32:34,427 --> 00:32:37,128
You know, when I graduated,
a producer said he wanted

824
00:32:37,179 --> 00:32:39,580
to do a CD of my music,
which, oh, my God,

825
00:32:39,598 --> 00:32:40,632
that's been my dream

826
00:32:40,683 --> 00:32:42,350
since before I even sat
in this room.

827
00:32:42,385 --> 00:32:45,470
Turns out, he only wanted
to do that on his terms.

828
00:32:45,521 --> 00:32:47,022
So I had a choice to make:

829
00:32:47,056 --> 00:32:49,641
I could do it his way and get
there a lot faster,

830
00:32:49,692 --> 00:32:54,479
or I could do it my way,
and maybe never,

831
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,647
never even make it.

832
00:32:55,698 --> 00:32:58,533
So I talked go my parents
and my friends,

833
00:32:58,567 --> 00:33:00,601
and I made a decision.

834
00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:02,153
It's my voice, Martin.

835
00:33:02,204 --> 00:33:03,738
Those are my songs.

836
00:33:03,772 --> 00:33:05,490
They tell my story.

837
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:08,576
I'm not gonna spend all
this time working on my truth,

838
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,161
and then have you slap something

839
00:33:10,212 --> 00:33:12,831
that doesn't even represent
the real me on its cover.

840
00:33:12,882 --> 00:33:15,333
So, I don't have
a record deal anymore,

841
00:33:15,384 --> 00:33:18,837
but I do have a record, which
I'll be giving to all of you,

842
00:33:18,888 --> 00:33:22,006
and selling at a table in front
of my church and out of my car,

843
00:33:22,058 --> 00:33:23,842
and on Amazon, so,

844
00:33:23,893 --> 00:33:27,295
whatever happens, at least
I was true to myself.

845
00:33:27,313 --> 00:33:28,513
And you will have gotten there

846
00:33:28,564 --> 00:33:29,731
by taking... and you know
it's coming...

847
00:33:29,765 --> 00:33:31,850
the higher ground. Hit it!

(footsteps approaching)

886
00:35:53,075 --> 00:35:55,560
Anderson, you wanted to see me?

887
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:57,195
You're not going to sing
to me, too, are you?

888
00:35:57,229 --> 00:35:58,897
I just wanted to give you this.

889
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,282
You can open it.

890
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:05,236
I thought maybe you
could wear it at work

891
00:36:05,287 --> 00:36:06,687
to show support
for gay marriage.

892
00:36:06,705 --> 00:36:08,022
Oh, it's really sweet of you.

893
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,191
Gay rights has been
my top issue,

894
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,993
even though it makes me
wildly unpopular

895
00:36:12,027 --> 00:36:13,527
with my distinguished
colleagues.

896
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:16,414
They're on the wrong side
of history, so screw 'em.

897
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:17,749
(box snaps shut)

898
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,585
I am so glad
that you feel that way,

899
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:23,371
because assuming
that we legally can,

900
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:26,925
um, I wanted to formally ask
for your permission

901
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,093
to ask Kurt to marry me.

902
00:36:30,145 --> 00:36:32,647
You kidding, or you nuts?

903
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,717
Kurt is my soul mate.

904
00:36:36,735 --> 00:36:38,770
I know that I've
hurt him badly,

905
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,189
but I also know
that if I want to get him back,

906
00:36:41,223 --> 00:36:42,407
I have to do something bold.

907
00:36:42,441 --> 00:36:44,609
Blaine,

908
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,778
it means a lot to me
that you love Kurt,

909
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:50,114
and you know,
you've been like family to me...

910
00:36:50,165 --> 00:36:52,566
So, you' saying that you're okay

911
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,419
with me asking for his hand?

912
00:36:54,453 --> 00:36:56,737
Oh, of course not.
No, you're still kids.

913
00:36:56,755 --> 00:36:59,424
Did you learn anything
from Finn and Rachel?

914
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:01,125
They are completely different.

915
00:37:01,176 --> 00:37:02,460
Completely different.

916
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,962
I don't think
that you understand

917
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,296
how it feels

918
00:37:05,347 --> 00:37:08,249
to finally be able
to legally get married.

919
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:12,470
And you don't really get
what it is to be married.

920
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,422
Straight, gay, whatever.

921
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,257
It's not the same
as living together.

922
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,475
Blaine, listen,

923
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,593
let's sit down for a second.

924
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,613
Seriously, come here.

925
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,820
Look, I can't tell you why,

926
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:31,823
but something happens
when you exchange vows.

927
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:34,492
It's a big deal.

928
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:37,795
It's why getting divorce is
so much harder than breaking up.

929
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,448
There's just
a really big difference

930
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:43,918
between marrying a person

931
00:37:43,952 --> 00:37:46,137
and marrying an idea.

932
00:37:46,171 --> 00:37:47,505
What if he meets someone else?

933
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,173
You think you two were meant to be?
Yes.

934
00:37:49,224 --> 00:37:51,459
Do you think you two
have a true love? Yes!

935
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,844
Then stop worrying.

936
00:37:55,397 --> 00:37:57,348
I got to go.

937
00:37:57,399 --> 00:37:59,800
Thanks for the pin.
Sure.

938
00:37:59,818 --> 00:38:02,303
Hey...

939
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,572
it's gonna be okay.

940
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,359
How do you know that, though?

941
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:12,530
When two people love each other
like you two do...

942
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,583
...everything works out.

943
00:38:27,394 --> 00:38:29,028
Yes.
(whooping and cheering)

944
00:38:29,062 --> 00:38:30,363
All right, let's review.

945
00:38:30,397 --> 00:38:31,614
What are y'all gonna
do at regionals?

946
00:38:31,665 --> 00:38:33,032
Riff, run and grunt!

947
00:38:33,066 --> 00:38:34,450
Emote!
Commit!

948
00:38:34,501 --> 00:38:36,202
Step up to the plate
and embrace our talent.

949
00:38:36,236 --> 00:38:38,454
And just like my boo
Miss Mercedes Jones,

950
00:38:38,505 --> 00:38:40,290
we're gonna treat
every note we sing

951
00:38:40,341 --> 00:38:41,841
and every breath we take

952
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:43,126
with a little
something-something

953
00:38:43,177 --> 00:38:45,345
we in the business of show
simply call "passion."

954
00:38:45,379 --> 00:38:46,679
And passion can be

955
00:38:46,714 --> 00:38:48,464
a scary thing,
but we shouldn't run

956
00:38:48,515 --> 00:38:49,882
or hide from it because

957
00:38:49,916 --> 00:38:51,884
passion is...
it's wonderful, yo.

958
00:38:51,918 --> 00:38:54,053
Auditorium,
4:00 p.m. sharp.

959
00:38:54,087 --> 00:38:56,055
I got a little jam
I'm gonna sing for all y'alls!

960
00:38:56,089 --> 00:38:58,741
And you best believe it's gonna
be sung with... say what?!

961
00:38:58,792 --> 00:39:00,743
ALL:
Passion!

962
00:39:00,794 --> 00:39:02,078
Yes!
Thank you.

963
00:39:02,129 --> 00:39:04,030
Yes!

964
00:39:09,586 --> 00:39:11,421
What's that?

965
00:39:11,472 --> 00:39:12,755
It's a gift.

966
00:39:12,806 --> 00:39:14,724
I got it at the
Broadway Flea Market.

967
00:39:14,758 --> 00:39:19,429
It is Debbie Allen's original
cane from <i>Fame...</i> the movie.

968
00:39:19,463 --> 00:39:22,065
Hmm. I wanted to thank
you for what you did.

969
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:23,049
The number?

970
00:39:23,067 --> 00:39:24,434
That's NYADA tradition.

971
00:39:24,485 --> 00:39:27,620
We do that when one of the tribe
gets a Broadway audition.

972
00:39:27,655 --> 00:39:29,939
Not the number.
I wanted to

973
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:32,108
thank you for everything that
you've done for me this year.

974
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:34,110
So... thank you.

975
00:39:34,161 --> 00:39:36,112
I've busted your ass
since September.

976
00:39:36,163 --> 00:39:37,229
You made me a better dancer.

977
00:39:37,247 --> 00:39:39,231
And that's why I came to NYADA,

978
00:39:39,249 --> 00:39:41,084
to learn and be challenged,

979
00:39:41,118 --> 00:39:43,753
and to work with the
best of the best.

980
00:39:43,787 --> 00:39:45,738
I saw something in you.

981
00:39:45,756 --> 00:39:48,741
That first day,
and I thought to myself,

982
00:39:48,759 --> 00:39:50,460
"This one's special.

983
00:39:50,511 --> 00:39:52,411
This one might make it."

984
00:39:52,429 --> 00:39:54,931
And that's why
I'm so relentless.

985
00:39:56,433 --> 00:39:58,918
Even the whole Brody thing?

986
00:39:58,936 --> 00:40:01,637
Well, that was
because of his abs.

987
00:40:01,689 --> 00:40:03,306
What? But yours are
so much better.

988
00:40:03,357 --> 00:40:04,590
When's your callback?

989
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,526
Oh, it's next week.

990
00:40:07,361 --> 00:40:09,145
I am so nervous, Miss July.

991
00:40:09,196 --> 00:40:11,597
I've never wanted anything
more in my whole life.

992
00:40:11,615 --> 00:40:13,599
You're gonna get it.

993
00:40:13,617 --> 00:40:15,101
I know you will, Rachel.

994
00:40:26,163 --> 00:40:27,663
(school bell rings)

995
00:40:29,383 --> 00:40:31,167
What's up?

996
00:40:31,218 --> 00:40:32,802
This is going to take
a lot of courage,

997
00:40:32,836 --> 00:40:35,338
considering our, um,
complicated history,

998
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:36,839
and all the emotions
involved, so...

999
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:40,309
um, I'm-I'm just gonna say it.

1000
00:40:40,344 --> 00:40:41,928
Go ahead, you get kind of cute

1001
00:40:41,962 --> 00:40:43,129
when you get nervous.

1002
00:40:43,147 --> 00:40:45,314
Hmm... I...

1003
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:47,466
wanted to ask you if...

1004
00:40:47,484 --> 00:40:49,468
well, will you...

1005
00:40:49,486 --> 00:40:52,522
maybe s-stick around
for regionals?

1006
00:40:52,573 --> 00:40:55,858
Oh! Oh, yeah, of course.

1007
00:40:55,909 --> 00:40:57,693
Yeah, Mercedes and I
already talked about it.

1008
00:40:57,745 --> 00:40:59,979
We want to stick around and root
you guys on at the competition.

1009
00:40:59,997 --> 00:41:01,814
Yeah, we wouldn't miss
it for the world.

1010
00:41:01,832 --> 00:41:03,166
Great.
Yeah.

1011
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,316
You know I would've said yes.

1012
00:41:04,334 --> 00:41:05,651
Right?
I know...

1013
00:41:05,669 --> 00:41:07,370
What a wonderful,
wonderful week.

1014
00:41:07,421 --> 00:41:09,839
And with you in it,
a wonderful life.
