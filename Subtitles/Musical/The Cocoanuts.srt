We wanna see you, Mr. Hammer.
What's the matter?
Somebody pay their bill?

00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,617
[All]
We want our money.
Yes, money.

7
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,780
You want your money?
We wanna get paid.

8
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:47,053
Oh, you want my money?
Is that fair?
Do I want your money?

9
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:50,562
Suppose George Washington's
soldiers had asked for money?
Where would this country be today?

10
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,121
But they did ask.
And where's Washington?

11
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:58,193
No, my friends. No, money will
never make you happy, and happy
will never make you money.

12
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,262
That might be a wisecrack,
but I doubt it.

00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:07,204
I'll make you all a promise.
If you'll all stick with me and work hard,
we'll forget about money.

15
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,542
Let's get together and
we'll make a regular hotel
out of this place.

16
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:15,577
I'll put writing paper in the hotel,
and next year if you behave
yourselves, I'll put in envelopes.

17
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:18,886
I'm gonna put extra blankets
free in all your rooms.
There'll be no cover charge.

18
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:23,156
[All Sigh]
Think of the opportunities
here in Florida.

19
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,857
Three years ago I came to Florida
without a nickel in my pocket.

20
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,730
And now I've got a nickel
in my pocket.
That's all very well, Mr. Hammer,

21
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:32,237
but we haven't been paid
in two weeks and we want our wages.

22
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:35,297
Wages?
Do you wanna be wage slaves?
Answer me that.

23
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:39,141
No.
No, of course not.
Well, what makes wage slaves?

24
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:42,340
Wages. I want you to be free.

25
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:46,511
Remember there's nothing like
liberty, except <i>Colliers</i> and
the <i>Saturday Evening Post.</i>

26
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,282
Be free, my friends.
One for all and all for me,

27
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:53,451
and me for you and three
for five and six for a quarter.

28
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:56,154
Pardon me. A couple of telegrams
for you, Mr. Hammer.
There you are.

29
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,254
Business is beginning
to pick up already.

30
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,266
Now if you gir...
boys will only be calm.

31
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:04,633
Uh-huh. " We arrive
this afternoon on the 4:30.

32
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:09,903
Kindly reserve two floors
and three ceilings."
They must be mice.

33
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,002
"If we like your property,
we will immediately buy it."

34
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,640
See that, things have
started our way already.
Who's it from?

35
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:20,618
Western Union,
and they've got a lot of money too.

36
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:24,088
On the 4:15, eh?
Well, I'll take the bus down myself.

37
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,558
Here's another one, Mr. Hammer.
See, we're gonna be
stuffed by tonight.

38
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:32,462
This hotel will be so crowded
that we'll be turning away
thousands of people.

39
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:36,059
"If there is another hotel
in Cocoanut Beach,
cancel our reservations."

40
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,228

Wait a minute. " P.S.

00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:47,404
You see, everything is all right, boys.
Everything is all right.

Oh, but that won't be
for a couple of years yet.

In the meantime, I want you
to buck up, get down to work.

Jamison, I'm going down

56
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,024
If I never come back, you'll know
I'm still waiting for the train.
Yes, sir.

57
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:51,297
And in my absence, I'm relying on you
to take good care of everything.
You can depend upon me, sir.

58
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,238
That's fine. If any guests
come in, take good care of them.
And think of me, Jamison.

59
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,242
You bet I will.
I'll be back someday.

60
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,370
All right.
Keep a light burning in the window,
if you can find a window.

61
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,778
All right, sir. Good-bye.
Good-bye, Jamison.

62
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:11,917
Hello, Harvey.
Why so downhearted?

63
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,653
Is Bob Adams cutting
you out with Polly Potter?

64
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:19,687
I'm not worried about a hotel clerk.
No, but I'll bet you're worried
about the Potter millions.

65
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:23,929
You generally could use money
in the old days.
Oh, lay off that stuff.

66
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,166
You know, marrying Polly
is the only way for you
to square your debts.

67
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,902
I can take care of myself.
I doubt it.

68
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:36,706
Suppose I have a little plan
that'll take care of both of us.
What do you mean?

69
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,512
Have you ever seen that diamond
necklace of Mrs. Potter's?

70
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:42,679
You bet I have.
What's that got to do with us?

71
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,183
Her room and my room
are right next to each other.

72
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,594
Hers is 318; mine, 320.

73
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:54,827
The door between is unlocked.
Well?

74
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,893
She keeps everything in a jewel case
locked up in her dresser.

75
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,633
The key is always in her bag.
That's what you've got to get.

76
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,870
It's a large order,
but maybe it can be done.

77
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:09,244
Suppose I invite Mrs. Potter
and Polly to take supper
with me tonight?

78
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:12,546
What then?
Sometime during the evening...

79
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,781
I might be able to get
the key out of her bag.

80
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:19,655
Now you're talking.
That sounds more like old times.

81
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,990
And now I will try and get rid
of Bob Adams for you.

82
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:32,295
Look, this is Cocoanut Manor.
You know that hill?

83
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:35,169
What a question.
Do I know that cunning little hill?

84
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,540
It's cunning, all right.
But that's why there hasn't been
any development here.

85
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,602
Couldn't it be cut down?

86
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,342
Too expensive.
Now, here's what happened.

87
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,884
John W. Berryman
was here to see it last month.

88
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:50,719
You know, Berryman practically
built Palm Beach and Miami,
but he said he wouldn't touch this.

89
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,749
Now when a man like that passes
a place up, no one wants it.

90
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:59,662
Do you know anything
about architecture?
No, but I'd love to learn.

91
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:03,828
Well, I made a drawing
of the whole place showing the hills.

92
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:08,465
It's a built-up scheme,
without cutting down the hill
or having it get in the way.

93
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,704
I made the hill fit in
with the architectural scheme.

94
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,802
I sent Berryman a copy last week,

95
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,712
and his secretary
wrote me a nice note saying
they were studying my plans.

96
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,012
That's thrilling.
Does Mr. Hammer know about it?

97
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:23,112
Not yet. But if he takes it,
I'll design the buildings.

98
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,123
Say, I may be an architect yet.

99
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:28,752
If he only does, I'm sure it
will be the most beautiful
place in the world.

100
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:32,525
It would be...
if you lived there.

101
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:35,931
Look, see what I've written?

102
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,766
"Heaven for Polly and me."

103
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:42,239
That looks great.
When do I move in?

104
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,368
Any day now.
It's a lovely dream, Bob.

105
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,639
Let's make it come true.

106
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,774

Will you look at that?
I am looking.

148
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:20,388
Well, it's darn cute.
I wonder who it can be.
Let's find out.

149
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,959
Then little Red Riding Hood
said to the wolf,
"Wolf, wolf, wolf, wolf."

150
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:27,938
<i>Hello. How do you do,</i>
<i>Miss Potter?</i>
Hello.

151
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,532
Hello.
Your mother is
looking for you, Polly.

152
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:33,373
She generally is,
and she generally finds me.

153
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,538
You know Mother.
Thanks a lot.

154
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:39,641
It was a lovely story, Mr. Adams.
I'd like to hear
the rest of it sometime.

155
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,845
Good-bye.

156
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,617
I wonder if I could
hear it sometime.

157
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,784
With pleasure.
How about you, Yates?

158
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,456
No, thanks.
You know what happens
to bad little boys who tell stories?

159
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:56,160
Certainly. They marry
the beautiful princess.

160
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,260
So long.

161
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,602

00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:25,760
Not always.
I might win out yet.

168
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:29,892
Well, miracles do happen.

169
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:33,464
Well, Polly, you've been
out again with Mr. Adams.

170
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,599
But only for a little while,
Mother.

171
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,974
Why a daughter of mine should
fool around with a hotel clerk...

172
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,843
when she has the opportunity of
marrying one of the Boston Yates...

173
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,849
is more than I can understand,

174
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,886
Oh, who cares
about the Boston Yates?

175
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,513
Anyway, Bob isn't a clerk.
He's an architect.

176
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,251
He's only clerking
until he can get started.

177
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:56,351
One who clerks, Polly,
is a clerk, and that settles it.

178
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,621
And I want you to remember
that no Potter...

179
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:04,226
has ever been involved
in a single scandal.

180
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,294
How about Uncle Dick?

181
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,567
Polly, it's a well-known fact...

182
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:12,771
that your uncle was drunk at the time.

183
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:16,337
<i>And another thing, young lady,</i>
<i>I'm quite tired of your</i>
<i>sitting out on the beach...</i>

184
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,508
<i>all hours of the night.</i>

185
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:22,213
Hey. Hey. Why don't you take
something for that insomnia?

186
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:25,621
You ought to cut out drinking
so much coffee.
I'm sorry, sir.

187
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:29,627
Say, any luck with the 4:30?
Yes, it didn't hit me.
That's the only luck I had with it.

188
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,925
Mr. Hammer, I think I know
what's wrong with the hotel.

189
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:34,966
I think I know too. You're fired.
Get your hat and my coat
and get out.

190
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:38,902
Maybe the season hasn't started yet.
Maybe the hotel hasn't opened yet.

191
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,439
Don't worry, Mr. Hammer.
In a few weeks you'll be cleaning up.

192
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:45,307
Yes, and making the beds.
Go on, get out of here.
I can handle this rush myself.

193
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:48,574
600 rooms in the hotel
and you have to sleep here.
How do you do, Mr. Hammer?

194
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:51,480
Why don't you whistle at the crossing?
You're just the woman I'm looking for.

195
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,348
Now whether you like it or not,
I'm gonna tell you
about Florida real estate.

196
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,186
It's the first time it's ever
been mentioned down here, today.
I'm sorry, but...

197
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:02,159
Do you know that property values
have increased 1929 since 1,000%?

198
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,923
Do you know that this
is the biggest development
since Sophie Tucker?

199
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:09,127
Do you know that Florida is the show spot
of America and Cocoanut Beach
is the black spot of Florida?

200
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:12,329
You told me about this yesterday.
I know, but I left out a comma. Look.

201
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:16,841
In a little while we're gonna
hold an auction sale at Cocoanut Manor,
the suburb terrible... uh, beautiful.

202
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:20,208
You must come over.
There's gonna be entertainment,
sandwiches and the auction.

203
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,543
If you don't like auctions,
we can play contract.

204
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:26,573
Here it is. Cocoanut Manor,
42 hours from Times Square
by railroad.

205
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:30,144
1,600 miles as the crow flies,
1,800 as the horseflies.

206
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:34,352
There you are, Cocoanut Manor
glorifying the American sewer
and the Florida sucker.

207
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:38,021
Why, it's the most exclusive
residential district in Florida.
Nobody lives there.

208
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:41,328
And the climate... Ask me
about the climate, I dare you.
Very well. How...

209
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,803
I'm glad you brought it up.
Our motto is, Cocoanut Beach...
no snow, no ice and no business.

210
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:48,465
Do you know that Florida is
the greatest state in the Union?
Is it?

211
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,668
Take its climate. No, we took that.
Take its fruits, take the alligator pears.

212
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,611
Take all the alligator pears
and keep 'em. See if I care.

213
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,740
Do you know how alligator pears
are made?
Haven't the slightest idea.

214
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:01,445
That's because
you've never been an alligator,
and don't let it happen again.

215
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,012
Do you know that it sometimes
requires years to bring the pear
and the alligator together?

216
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,853
They don't like each other.
No.

217
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:11,123
No. Do you know how many alligator
pears are sent out of this state every year
and told not to come back?

218
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,528
I don't think I do.
All they can get a hold of.

219
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,000
Florida feeds the nation,
but nobody feeds me and that's
what I wanna talk to you about.

220
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,367
Mr. Hammer...
Another thing,
take our cattle raising.

221
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:23,306
I don't mean anything personal.
But here is the ideal cattle
raising section.

222
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,935
We have longhorns, shorthorns
and shoehorns.

223
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:28,104
Mr. Hammer, will you let me
say something, please?

224
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,876
I hardly think so,
and there's something else
I wanna bring to your mind.

225
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:34,646
Where will you be when you're 65?
That's only about three months from now.

226
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,281
If I were to buy, I should prefer
someplace like Palm Beach.

227
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:41,793
Palm Beach?
The Atlantic City of yesterday?
The slums of tomorrow?

228
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,852
Do you know that the population
of Cocoanut Beach
has doubled in the past week?

229
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,889
Has it?
Three bulldogs were born.
We're expecting a nanny goat in the morning.

230
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,629
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
I must be going.
Aw, now, don't go.

231
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:55,332
Before you go, let me show you
a sample of our sewer pipe
we're gonna lay.

232
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,740
Look at it. Nobody could fool you
on a sewer pipe, can they,
a woman like you?

233
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,745
Now this is the eight-inch pipe.

234
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,475
But of course, all property
owners will be allowed to vote
on the size of their pipe.

235
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:08,680
In case of a tie, it goes to the Supreme Court,
and I can give you a little
inside information in advance.

236
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,957
The chief justice is crazy
about this type of sewer.

237
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,391
Here, put it in your pocket.
I'll see you later.

238
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,191
Mr. Hammer, I can't use this.
I don't want it.

239
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:26,294
[Ringing]

240
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,734
Hello. Yes?

241
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,506
Ice water in 318?

242
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,548
Is that so?
Where'd you get it?

243
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,083
Oh, you want some?
Oh, that's different.

244
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,449
Have you got any ice?
No, I haven't.

245
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,580
This is Cocoanut Beach...
no snow, no ice.

246
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:47,352
Get some onions.
That'll make your eyes water.

247
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,418
What? You too!

248
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,390
Oh, Mr. Hammer.
Mrs. Thompson wants to know...

249
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,264
if you'd reserve a table for dinner
for her in a nice quiet spot.

250
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,497
A nice quiet spot?
Yeah.

251
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,436
Tell her she can eat in the lobby.

252
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:05,603
We ought to dress this place up a bit.
It looks terrible.

253
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:09,044
Front. Front.

254
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:11,048
Front. Here, front.

255
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:14,711
Here, front.
Here, front, front, front, front.

256
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:17,584
Jamison, what's become of our front?
Are we all out of front?
I haven't seen 'em.

257
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,352
I'm gonna fire some of those people.
Give me the fire bell.

258
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:25,124
Why don't you stick around here.
If anybody comes in that looks like
a customer, tie 'em and brand 'em.

259
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,427
Yes, sir.

260
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,764
Look at him.
He's dressed better than I am.

261
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,838
[Horn Honking]

262
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,635
[Whistles]
Hey, come on. Come on.
[Honking]

263
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,812
Hey, come here. Come here.
Come here!

264
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:48,319
- <i>Gentlemen, how do you do?</i>
- How do you do?

265
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:51,515
Are you boys giving me
the runaround? Come over here.

266
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,127
Now what do you want?
Explain your business.

267
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:00,131
We send you a telegram.
Oh, you're the boys
that sent the telegram?

268
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,396
How do you do?
That's a coincidence.
I used to send telegrams myself.

269
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:05,402
How are you?
And how are you?
[Honks]

270
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,897
That's all right. Don't worry.

271
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,794
Say, you can stay, but you'll have
to take that groundhog out of here.

272
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,795
Now what do you want?
Explain your business.

273
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:34,024
We make a "reservash."
"Reservash"?

274
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,090
Yes. We want a room
and no bath.

275
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:39,604
Oh, I see. You're just here for the winter.
Well, step this way and
I'll see what I can do for you.

276
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:43,698
All right. We stay for the summer too.
I'm sorry, boys,
but we haven't got any vacancies.

277
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,675
He's got no vacancies?
<i>We got plenty of rooms.</i>

278
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,837
That's all right, we take a room.
You want a room?
[Honks]

279
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:51,747
All right, we take a vacancy.
<i>Boy, take the gentlemen's baggage.</i>

280
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,149
Hey, what are you...

281
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,210
<i>[Bell Dings]</i>

282
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,956
Hey, hey, do you know
that suitcase is empty?

283
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,993
That's all right.
We'll fill it up before we leave.

284
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,654
Oh, you will, eh?
Well, you'll empty it before I go out.

285
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:09,292
Step this way, boys.
Just put your moniker on there
and everything will be "A.K."

286
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,696
Look what he do.
Don't do that.

287
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,706
Step right this way, boy.
Three shots for five.
He never misses.

288
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,800
This boy wins the gold cigar.
Anybody else? Step right this way.

289
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:21,641
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Don't throw that.

290
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:24,841
That's only for long distance.
All right, all right.

291
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,316
Now what do you want?
Would you like a suite
on the third floor?

292
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,752
No, I'll take a Polack
in the basement.

293
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,755
<i>You'll have to take that up</i>
<i>with the commissary department.</i>

294
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,917
<i>That's an entirely different</i>
<i>proposition and I can't...</i>

295
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:39,353
Here you are.

296
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:42,731
Let me help you here.

297
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:47,295
I'm sorry.
The afternoon mail isn't in yet.
I can use you the first of the month.

298
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,602
Telegram for Mr. Hammer.
<i>Telegram?</i>

299
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:53,304
Just tell them I'll send them
the money in the morning.
Now then, what do you want?

300
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:56,279
What do you want?
Do you want a single room?
We'd like to double up.

301
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:58,339
Well, eat some green apples.
[Ringing]

302
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,408
[Chuckles]
Just a joke.

303
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,621
What's that?
You'll have to talk louder.
I can't hear you.

304
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:11,687
If you'll take your nose out
of the receiver, it'll be okay.

305
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:14,630
[Chuckles]
Funny fella, you.

306
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,361
Hello. What's that?

307
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,767
You wanna know where you can
get a hold of Mrs. Potter?

308
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:22,068
I don't know.
She's awfully ticklish.

309
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,109
Now, I'm in a position, gentlemen...

310
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,070
He's a hungry.

311
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:40,180
Here, have one of these flowers.
They're buckwheat.

312
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:43,227
Pick out a nice one now.
I don't want you to get
any of the worst ones.

313
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,263
There you are.
I'm so glad.

314
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,423
Now, if you boys will pardon me
for a few moments,

315
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:50,024
I have some very important
business to attend to.

316
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:53,128
As a matter of fact,
I'm going upstairs to get

Just think, tonight... tonight...

479
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:27,082
when the moon
is sneaking around the clouds,
I'll be sneaking around you.

480
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:29,285
I'll meet you tonight
under the moon.

481
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,158
Oh, I can see you now...
you and the moon.

482
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,164
You wear a necktie
so I'll know you.

483
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,313
["When My Dreams Come True"]

484
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,596
Send up some ice water right away.

485
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,267
That's right. Thank you.
<i>[Knocking]</i>

486
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:16,309
Thank goodness.
Close the door.

487
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:21,947
Did you get the key?
Yes. It's one of these.

488
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,120
Oh, that's fine. Now, listen.
We can't take any chances on this job.

489
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,664
How do you mean?
There's bound to be trouble
when she misses the necklace.

490
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:30,223
Well?
We can't have it found on us.

491
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:33,498
I should say not.
We've got to play it safe
and hide it somewhere for a while.

492
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:35,505
Hide it?
Just for a few days.

493
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:37,564
Yes, but where?
Anywhere but in here.

494
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:39,905
Hide it?
I know just the place.

495
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:42,571
A hollow tree stump about a mile
from here. Will that do?

496
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:45,877
Fine, but how do I get there?
It's Cocoanut Manor.
You've been out there.

497
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,783
I'm not so sure, Harvey.
Here, I'll show you.

498
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:53,381
Now, you... you go
right out Cocoanut Road.

499
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:55,391
Then there's Augustine Road,
like this,

500
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:57,984
but instead,
you take the Granada Road.

501
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:01,759
Suddenly, you come to a clearing
with a fringe of trees around it.

502
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:03,993
That's Cocoanut Manor
where the stump is.

503
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:07,697
It's about 20 feet
from the edge of the clearing.

504
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:10,332
That's where you put the jewels.
You can't miss it.

505
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,433
Now you take the necklace
right out there, see?

506
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,673
I've got to go back downstairs,
or Mrs. Potter will be suspicious.

507
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,340
And be careful.
I will.

508
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:33,227
Cocoanut Manor, Granada Road,

509
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:36,095
20 feet from the clearing.

510
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:39,000
Everything's going along
swimmingly now.

511
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:14,499
Do you remember me?
The prince of Wales?
Why, yes, of course I do...

512
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:17,132
Mr. Hammer, how dare
you come into my room?
<i>[Door Slams Shut]</i>

513
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,699
If there's gonna be
two people in this room,
it'll be 50 cents extra.

514
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:24,537
<i>[Knocking]</i>

515
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:28,618
Did he go?
Who?

516
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,517
Anybody.
<i>[Knocking]</i>

517
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:33,250
Get out. Oh, Prince,
how you frightened me.

518
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,122
[Honking]
<i>[Knocking]</i>

519
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,093
This hotel not only has running water,
it has running guests.

520
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,363
Do you remember me?
Prince of Wales?
<i>[Knocking]</i>

521
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:48,701
- Who is it?
- It's me, the king of England.

00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:52,799
- <i>[Chico] My father!</i>

Come in.

<i>[Knocking]</i>

526
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:16,160
Ice water.
Put it there.

527
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:21,131
Thank you.
<i>[Hammer] "Thank you"?</i>
<i>Why didn't you give him a dime?</i>

528
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:27,102
<i>[Knocking]</i>
Come in.

529
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:29,372
Lay down.

530
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:31,539
Well, I never.
I should say not.

531
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:35,915
You get out of here.
Get out. Hurry. Hurry.

532
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:38,045

533
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:40,955
<i>[Knocking]</i>

534
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:43,687
What is the matter with that man?

535
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:48,396
Mr. Hammer, what are you
doing in my room?
[Honking]

536
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:50,456
[Mutters]

537
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:57,466
<i>Don't you dare take that coat</i>
<i>off in this room. You get out of here</i>
<i>as fast as you can go.</i>

538
00:42:57,541 --> 00:43:01,739
I was only playing, that's all.
I'll find out about this outfit.

539
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:04,508
<i>Thank goodness he's gone.</i>
<i>Never mind, Operator.</i>

540
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,914
<i>[Knocking]</i>
<i>Come in.</i>

541
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,083
Who are you?
That's all right.
I'll be through in a minute.

542
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:16,649
- Well, I guess there's nobody in here.
- You don't know where to look.

543
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:19,560
What's that you said?
Oh, this is awful.

544
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,497
When you've quite finished,
let me know.

545
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:32,766
Well, everything seems
to be all right in here.

546
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:35,505
I'm not so sure about that.

547
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:40,075
<i>[Knocking]</i>
All right. I know where to go.

548
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:13,743
Alone at last.

549
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,808
[Gasps]

550
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:19,012
Come over here. I wanna see you.
Now listen to me.

551
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:21,489
I'm not gonna have
that red-headed fellow
running around the lobby.

552
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:24,083
If you wanna keep him up in the room,
you'll have to keep him in a trap.

553
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,095
I can't catch him.
Who is he?

554
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:29,132
That's a my partner, but he no speak.
Oh, that's your silent partner.

555
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:32,726
Well, anyhow, you wired me
about some property.
I've thought it over.

556
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:34,828
Now, I can let you have
three lots watering the front,

557
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:37,533
or I can let you have three lots
fronting the water.

558
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:42,170
Now, these lots cost me $ 9,000
and I'm gonna let you have them
for 15 because I like you.

559
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:45,079
I no buy nothing.
I ain't got a no money.
What?

560
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:47,447
You got a no money?
I no got a one cent.

561
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,679
How are you gonna pay
for your room?
That's your lookout.

562
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:53,018
Oh, you're just an idle "roomer."

563
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,921
Well, you see, we come here
to make money.

564
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:57,790
I read in the paper and it say,
"Big Boom In Florida."
So we come.

565
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:01,353
We're a couple of big booms too.
I'll show you how you can
make some real money.

566
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:04,959
I'm going to hold an auction
in a little while in Cocoanut Manor.

567
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:09,335
You know what an auction is, eh?
I come from Italy
on the <i>Atlantic Auction.</i>

568
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,706
Well, let's go ahead
as if nothing happened.

569
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:14,710
I say I'm holding an auction
at Cocoanut Manor.

570
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:17,076
And when the crowd
gathers around, I want you
to mingle with them.

571
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:20,583
Don't pick their pockets,
just mingle with them...
I'll find time for both.

572
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:22,915
Well, maybe we can
cut out the auction.

573
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:25,454
Here's what I mean.
If somebody says $100,
you say two.

574
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:27,513
If somebody says two, you say three.
Bid up.

575
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:30,617
That's right. Now,
if nobody says anything,
then you start it off.

576
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:34,892
How am I gonna know
when they no say nothin'?
Well, they'll probably notify you.

577
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:37,433
You fool, if they don't say anything,
you'll hear 'em, won't you?

578
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:41,164
Well, maybe I no listen.
Well, don't tell 'em.

579
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:45,174
Now then, if we're successful
in disposing of these lots, I'll see
that you get a nice commission.

580
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:48,837
And how about some money?
Well, you can have your choice.

581
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:51,642
Now, in arranging these lots,
of course, we use blueprints.

582
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:55,014
You know what
a blueprint is, huh?
It's oysters.

583
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:59,021
How is it you never got
double pneumonia?
I go around by myself.

584
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:03,588
Do. You know what a lot is?
Yeah, it's too much.

585
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,493
I don't mean a whole lot.
Just a little lot with nothing on it.

586
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:09,464
Anytime you got a too much,
you got a whole lot.
Look, I explain it to you.

587
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,933
Sometimes you no got a enough.
Sometimes you got a whole lot.

588
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:13,867
Sometimes you got a little bit.
You no think it's enough.

589
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:16,531
Somebody else maybe
think it's a too much.
It's a whole lot too.

590
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:20,202
Now, a whole lot is a too much,
too much is a whole lot.
Same thing.

591
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:23,303
The next time I see you,
remind me not to talk to you,
will you?

592
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:26,543
All right...
Come over here, Rand McNally,
and I'll explain this thing to you.

593
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:30,849
Now look, this is a map and diagram
of the whole Cocoanut section.

594
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:35,415
This whole area is within
a radius of approximately
three-quarters of a mile.

595
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:40,259
Radius. Is there a remote possibility
that you know what radius means?

596
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:44,596
It's a W.J.Z.
Well, I walked right into that one.

597
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:47,535
It's gonna be a cinch explaining
the rest of this thing to you,
I can see that.

598
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:51,301
I catch on quick.
That's a rodeo you're thinking of.

599
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:54,572
Look, Einstein.
Here's Cocoanut Manor.

600
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,909
No matter what you say,
this is Cocoanut Manor.

601
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,744
Here's Cocoanut Manor.
Here's Cocoanut Heights.

602
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,682
That's a swamp.

603
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:05,882
And right over here
where the road forks,
that's Cocoanut Junction.

604
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:08,618
Where have you got
Cocoanut Custard?

605
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:10,626
That's on one of the forks.

606
00:47:10,694 --> 00:47:13,754
You probably eat with your knife,
so you won't have to worry about that.

607
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,527
Now, here is the main road
leading out of Cocoanut Manor.

608
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,659
That's the road
I wish you were on.

609
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:22,102
Now, over here on this site
we're gonna build
an eye and ear hospital.

610
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,902
This is gonna be
a sight for sore eyes.

611
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:26,408
You understand?
That's fine.

612
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:29,639
Now, right over here,
this is the residential section.

613
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:31,738
People live there, huh?

614
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:34,010
No, that's the stockyards.

615
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:36,450
Now all along here,
this is the riverfront,

616
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,479
and all along the river...
all along the river,
those are all levees.

617
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,787
That's the Jewish neighborhood?

618
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:46,291
Well, we'll pass over that.

619
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:48,297
You're a peach, boy.

620
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:53,064
Now, here is a little peninsula,
and here is a viaduct
leading over to the mainland.

621
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:55,764
Why a duck?
I'm all right. How are you?

622
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:59,502
I say here is a little peninsula,
and here's a viaduct
leading over to the mainland.

623
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:02,238
All right. Why a duck?

624
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:04,974
I'm not playing Ask Me Another.
I say that's a viaduct.

625
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:08,506
All right. Why a duck?
Why a duck? Why a no chicken?

626
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:10,610
I don't know why a no chicken.

627
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:13,713
I'm a stranger here myself.
All I know is that it's a viaduct.

628
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:17,123
You try to cross over there a chicken,
and you'll find out viaduct.

629
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:20,357
I no go someplace...
It's deep water, that's why a duck.

630
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:21,954
It's deep water.
That's why a duck.

631
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:24,865
Look, rube. Suppose you were
out horseback riding...

632
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:27,495
and you came to that stream
and wanted to ford over.

633
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,539
You couldn't make it.
It's too deep.

634
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:32,803
But what do you want with a Ford
if you got a horse?

635
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:34,901
Well, I'm sorry the matter
ever came up.

636
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:37,446
All I know is that it's a viaduct.
Look. All right.

637
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:40,312
I catch on to why a horse,
why a chicken, why a this, why a that.

638
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:42,352
I no catch on to why a duck.

639
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:45,582
Well, I was only fooling.
I was only fooling.

640
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:47,817
They're gonna build a tunnel
there in the morning.

641
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:51,588
Now, is that clear to you?
Yes, everything except
why a duck.

642
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:54,028
Well, that's fine. Then we can
go ahead with this thing.

643
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:57,032
Now, look, I'm gonna take you down
and show you our cemetery.

644
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,194
I've got a waiting list of 50 people
at that cemetery just dying to get in.

645
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,135
But I like you.
You're my friend.

646
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:04,639
I like you and I'm gonna shove you
in ahead of all of them.
I know you like me.

647
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:07,074
I'm gonna see that
you get a steady position.
That's a good.

648
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:09,578
And if I can arrange it,
it'll be horizontal.

649
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:12,171
Now remember,
when the auction starts,
if somebody says $100...

650
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:13,739
I say 200.
That's grand.

651
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:15,842
Now, if somebody says 200.
I say 300.

652
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:18,046
That's great.
Now, you know how
to get down there?

653
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,986
No...
Now, look.

654
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:22,218
You go down there,
down that narrow path there...

655
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,385
until you come
to that little jungle there.

656
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,396
You see it?
Where those thatched palms are.
Yes, I see.

657
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,261
And then there's
a little clearing there...

658
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:31,665
a little clearing with
a wire fence around it.

659
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:34,670
You see that wire fence there?
All right. Why a fence?

660
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:37,605
Oh, no, we're not gonna go
all through that again.

661
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:39,073
You come along with me
and I'll fix you up.

662
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:45,973
I know what you mean.
Bid 'em up. Go higher.
One say 100, 2... 200, 300.

663
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:49,143
That's it. If somebody says
$100, you say 200.
If somebody says two, you say three.

664
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:52,382
Help me put this deal over,
you can have anything you got.
I got a nothing.

665
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:54,390
Be alert. That's it. Be alert.

666
00:49:54,458 --> 00:50:00,124
Be alert, or papa don't go out at all.
I be alert. I don't know
what it is, but I be it.

667
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:04,429
All ye suckers
who are gonna get trimmed,
step this way for the big swindle.

668
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:08,369
Ladies and gentlemen, before proceeding
with the main business of the day,

669
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:10,770
which is the selling
of these lots at any price,

670
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:13,401
we're gonna have
a little entertainment...
very little.

671
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:17,811
I wanna present to you
Miss Polly Potter,
the best paying guest in the hotel.

672
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:20,315
In fact, the only paying guest
in the hotel.

673
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:24,013
She will sing for you and for me too.
Miss Potter.

674
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:28,816
Monkeys upon a tree

675
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:31,884
Never are very blue

676
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:33,930
They never seem to be

677
00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:36,989
Under par
That is true

678
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,058
Not like the ones you see

679
00:50:39,136 --> 00:50:42,071
On a bar in the zoo

680
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:44,107
Monkeys upon a tree

681
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:47,302
Do the monkey doodle doo

682
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:51,473
Oh, among the mangoes
where the monkey gang goes

683
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,039
You can see them do

684
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:57,575
The little monkey doodle doo

685
00:50:57,654 --> 00:51:01,681
Oh, a little monkey playing
on his one key

686
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:04,386
Gives them all the cue

687
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:07,828
To do the monkey doodle doo

688
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,492
Let me take you by the hand

689
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:13,229
Over to the jungle band

690
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:15,737
If you're too old for dancing

691
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:17,467
Get yourself a monkey gland

692
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:20,942
And then let's go, my little dearie

693
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:22,945
Here's the Darwin theory

694
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:25,174
Telling me and you

695
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:28,649
To do the monkey doodle doo

696
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:34,993
<i>[Ends]</i>
<i>[Applause]</i>

697
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:37,733
That's Florida, folks...
singing, dancing and entertainment.

698
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:39,741
After the entertainment,
there'll be sandwiches.

699
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:42,869
But remember,
if there are no lots sold,
there will be no sandwiches.

700
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:47,280
Florida, folks... sunshine, sunshine.
Perpetual sunshine
all the year around.

701
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:49,910
Let's get the auction started
before we get a tornado.

702
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:51,681
Right this way.
Step forward, everybody.

703
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:55,054
Friends, you are now
in Cocoanut Manor,
one of the finest cities in Florida.

704
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,889
Of course, we still need
a few finishing touches,
but who doesn't?

705
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:01,829
This is the heart of
the residential district. Every lot is
a stone's throw from the station.

706
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:04,526
As soon as they throw enough stones,
we're gonna build a station.

707
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:07,092
800 wonderful residences
will be built right here.

708
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:08,899
Why, they're as good as up.
Better.

709
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,906
You can have any kind
of a home you want to.

710
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,374
You can even get stucco.
Oh, how you can get stuck, oh.

711
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:15,809
Now is the time to buy
while the new boom is on.

712
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:18,507
Remember that old saying,
"a new boom sweeps clean"?

713
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:21,812
And don't forget the guarantee...
my personal guarantee.

714
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:25,616
If these lots don't double
in value in a year, I don't know
what you can do about it.

715
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:30,558
Now, we'll take lot number 20,
right at the corner of DeSota Avenue.

716
00:55:30,627 --> 00:55:33,790
Of course, you all know who DeSota was?
He discovered a body of water.

717
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:37,492
You've all heard of the water
that they named after him...
DeSota Water.

718
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:39,364
Now this lot has a 20-foot frontage,

719
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:42,337
a 14-foot "backage"
and a mighty fine gobbet.

720
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:45,636
Now, what am I offered for this lot?
Anything at all? Anything at all?

721
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:48,177

Well, the auction is practically over.

727
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:06,893
It's all over but the shooting.

00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:17,503
Wrap up that lot

<i>[Man] Yes, sir.</i>

731
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:21,032
Well, I came out even on that one.
That was a big success.

732
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:25,445
Yeah, one more success like that
and I'll sell my body to a medical institute.

733
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:28,382
Now, we'll take lot number 21.

734
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:32,114
There it is, right over there, folks.
Right where that coconut tree is.

00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:35,453
What am I offered for lot number 21?

736
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:38,460
Why, my friend, there's

in those coconuts.

737
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:42,259
And what milk!
Milk from contented cow-conuts.

600, 700, 800.
What the heck I care?

740
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:51,306
What the heck do you care?
But how about me?

741

Sold to What The Heck for $800.

742
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:57,045
I hope all your teeth have cavities.

743
00:56:57,113 --> 00:57:00,241
And don't forget...
abscess makes the heart
grow fonder.

744
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:04,415
When he said "why a duck,"
I should have smelled a rat.

745
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:06,819

Can't you visualize bargains?
Don't you wanna make money?

787
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:20,155
I'm gonna try one more lot,
and if I don't dispose of this,
I'm gonna fold up. You get me?

788
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:23,420
We're gonna take lot number 26,
the star lot of the whole proceedings.

789
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:26,860
Here it is. Right there where
the stump of that tree is
overlooking the oceanfront.

790
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:31,196
- One of the finest sites in Florida
Now somebody make me an offer.
- $ 200.

791
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:34,065
$300.
Who'll say 400?

792
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:36,537
$ 400.
Do I hear...

793
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:40,098
Keep Winnie the Pooh out of here.
He'll ruin me. Who'll say 500?

794
00:59:40,176 --> 00:59:42,201
$ 500.
Six? Come on.

795
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:46,180
$800.
Now there's a gentleman
with vision and a nice haircut.

796
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:49,047
There's a gentleman with vision.
Who'll say 1,000?
$1,000.

797
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:52,554
There's a gentleman with double vision
and a better haircut.
Who'll say 1,100?

798
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:56,183
1,100.
There's a gentleman with astigmatism.
Twelve once? Come on.

799
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:57,886
$1,200.
Twelve, hail and farewell.

800
00:59:57,961 --> 01:00:00,088
<i>Who'll say 13? Come on.</i>

801
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:03,621
I'll bid...
<i>Thirteen? Do I hear 13?</i>

802
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,294
Twelve? Twelve once.
Twelve twice.

803
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:10,328
Sold to Mr. Adams for $1,200.
And a mighty fine piece of property
you got there, buddy.

804
01:00:10,406 --> 01:00:12,840
Oh, Bob, you've got it!
<i>Make a note of that.</i>

805
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:15,969
What happened?
I protest against that.

806
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:19,743
I didn't have a chance to bid.
What do you mean? I want you
to understand I don't discriminate.

807
01:00:19,816 --> 01:00:23,183
You had the same opportunity
as everybody else.
Mr. Hammer.

808
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:26,221
Mr. Hammer, I've been robbed.

809
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,223
[All Murmuring]
What?

810
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:31,385
My necklace in your hotel...
Oh, Mother.

811
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:34,089
It's worth $100,000.

812
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:37,860
Was it valuable?
"Was it valuable"?

813
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:40,425
I'll give a thousand dollars' reward
for its return.

814
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:43,370
You hear that?
This little lady has lost
a necklace worth $100,000,

815
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:45,873
and she offers a thousand dollars'
reward for its return.

816
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:49,105
2,000.
Sold for $ 2,000.
Make a note of that.

817
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:52,477
Comin' through.
I'll take charge of this.

818
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:56,040
All you people get back
and give us plenty of room
and keep quiet.

819
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:59,885
Cut that out.
Come on.
Get back, everybody.

820
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:02,322
What's the matter?
What, he hurt you?

821
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:05,486
What's the matter?
No push, boy. Come on.

822
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:08,792
Come on. All right.
Start fighting. Go on.

823
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:11,026
[Muttering]

824
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:14,502
Mr. Hammer, what's
the matter with him?

825
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:17,004
I don't know where he's from.
He hasn't any license on him.

826
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:19,234
What is it? What?

827
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:23,678
Yes, that's it.
That's it.

828
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:25,680
You dear man.
[Kissing]

829
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:30,151
Oh, I'm so happy.
I must kiss you again.

830
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:33,086
So that's it. I saw you
in that room last night.

831
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:36,990
Grabbing off stuff
for the reward, eh?
Now then, you, come clean.

832
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,926
Hey! Let go of that.

833
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:42,829
All right. Leave him go.
Come on. Leave him go.

834
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,432
How'd you know
that necklace was there?

835
01:01:46,502 --> 01:01:49,562
Officer, may I make
a suggestion?
What is it?

836
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:52,733
Isn't it possible that the gentleman
who bought this lot might know
something about it?

837
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:56,370
Why was he so anxious to buy it?
How about it, you?
Why did you buy this lot?

838
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,648
None of your business.

839
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,581
He is a desperate character.
Mother, he isn't.

840
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:05,610
Whenever a fella shuts up and
won't say anything, I've noticed it's
generally on account of a woman.

841
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:08,885
- Who is she?
- None of your business.

842
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:11,119
I won't say a word.

843
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:14,129
You won't say anything.
This guy's letting on to be a dummy.

844
01:02:14,197 --> 01:02:16,358
[Horn Honking]

845
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:20,802
[Honking]

846
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:25,407
This bird you can't understand
when he does talk.
[Muttering]

847
01:02:25,475 --> 01:02:30,139
Is there anybody here
who <i>will</i> talk?
I will, but I can't think of anything.

848
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:33,546
Well, if you won't tell me about it,
you'll tell somebody else.

849
01:02:33,616 --> 01:02:36,608
Wait a minute.
You mean to say that...
That's enough. Come on.

850
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:39,314
Please. Please don't take him.
What?

851
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:42,915
I didn't want you to steal it, Bob.
I had no idea that you'd do it.

852
01:02:42,992 --> 01:02:46,052
Oh, I feel awful.
What are you talking about?

853
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:49,223
Bob, what does she mean?
Polly.

854
01:02:49,298 --> 01:02:51,892
<i>[Detective]</i>
<i>So that's it.</i>
Oh, it's all my fault.

855
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:56,166
I had no idea
he'd think that I meant it.
I didn't want you to do it.

856
01:02:56,239 --> 01:03:00,437
I just meant that you
could give me one like it.
Wait a minute.

857
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:02,876
Are you accusing me
of taking Mrs. Potter's necklace?

858
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:08,042
I'm taking all the blame myself.
I was joking, and you
took me seriously.

859
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:11,382
Bob, last night when you
told me that you'd taken it,
I just couldn't believe it.

860
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:15,220
Told you I'd taken what?
Why, Polly, she's out of her mind.

861
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:18,124
It sounds quite plausible to me.
Mother.

862
01:03:18,194 --> 01:03:22,290
He didn't know what he was doing.
I begged him to take it back.

863
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:25,630
Say, I'm not gonna stand
for any more of this.

864
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:27,965
Why, the whole thing
is ridiculous.

865
01:03:28,037 --> 01:03:30,597
It's absurd!

866
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:33,767
Do you people really think
for one moment that...

867
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,871
Oh, I... I don't care what
you think, any of you.

868
01:03:37,947 --> 01:03:40,541
Polly, you know it's a lie,
don't you?

869
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:44,518
It was just a harmless flirtation,
and then, well, he lost his head.

870
01:03:44,587 --> 01:03:47,021
Don't you know it's a lie?
Of course I do.

871
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:49,853
You don't think I'd believe
a silly story like that, do you?
Polly.

872
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:51,860
Mother, I don't believe it!

873
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:55,364
Mr. Adams, I must ask you
never to speak to my daughter again.
But, Mrs. Potter...

874
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:58,264
Bob, I'm going with you.
You'll stay here.

875
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:00,825
Yes, Polly.

876
01:04:00,903 --> 01:04:04,031
You stay here.
It's only for a little while.

877
01:04:04,106 --> 01:04:08,008
[Chuckles]
Why, the whole thing is ridiculous.
[Detective] You ready?

878
01:04:11,047 --> 01:04:12,981
Yes.

879
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:15,984
Oh, I'm so sorry, Bob.

880
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:18,486
Don't keep it up any longer.

881
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:21,318
All right.
I'll have a confession
out of him in half an hour.

882
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:23,585
Come on, you.
Bob!

883
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:26,287
Will you come back here.
Now we'll take lot number 27.

884
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,728
I've been so unsuccessful
in disposing these other lots,

885
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:31,995
that I'm gonna give away
a half a pound of tea with
every lot I sell from now on.

886
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:34,332
There's only one way
to wipe out this disgrace.

887
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:37,566
You must make people forget
that you ever knew this young man.

888
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,665
Mother! What are you saying?

889
01:04:39,742 --> 01:04:43,405
You see what's come of your way.
Now I'm going to have mine.

890
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:45,413
Mr. Yates?
Yes, Mrs. Potter?

891
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:49,008
My daughter has reconsidered
her answer to you.
Mother!

892
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:51,918
Your engagement
will be announced tonight.

893
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:53,956
That's wonderful, Polly.

894
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:57,322
I shall give a dinner at the hotel...
A dinner? A dinner?

895
01:04:57,393 --> 01:05:00,362
You want the 30-
or 40-cent dinner?
You may invite everyone.

896
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:03,023
It's 50 with Jell-O,
and, oh, how you can Jell-O.

897
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:06,865
In honor of the engagement
of my daughter to Mr. Harvey Yates.
I see.

898
01:05:06,936 --> 01:05:09,871
Let me be the last
to congratulate you, and you too.

899
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:12,635
I'm sure you'll have
a very dismal wedding.

900
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:16,371
Congratulations, Yates.
Congratulations, Polly.

Please go ahead.
Why, what's the matter, dear?

904
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:35,796
Nothing. Please go.

She gotta have you because
tonight she's gonna be engaged.
Engaged?

01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:06,503
It's been reported to me
there's a poker game
going on in room 420.

941

Go up there and knock on the door
and see if you can get me a seat.
Yes, sir.

I'll be right over.

All right, Bob. The coast is clear.
Nobody around.

01:09:22,725 --> 01:09:26,821
Here he is. We got him.
We got him, all right.

946
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:30,593
Hello. Are you out on parole?
No. These two gentlemen
helped me to get out.

947
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:34,193
I'm ever so much obliged
to you, Mr. Hammer.
They told me it was your idea.

948
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:37,865
I can't begin to thank you.
That's all right. Maybe you do
as much for me sometime.

Believe me,
it's no fun being in jail.

Jail is no place for a young fella.
There's no advancement.

955
01:10:01,463 --> 01:10:05,399
But seriously, Mr. Hammer,
you know that story of Penelope's
was all a lie, don't you?

956
01:10:05,467 --> 01:10:09,631
Now, what's the use of worrying?
It's silly to worry, isn't it?
You're gone today and here tomorrow.

957
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:12,469
But you know it was a lie.
How am I gonna prove it?
Well, of course...

What is it?

Come here with that.
I felt kind of flimsy.

Yes, sir.

969
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:04,025
Go upstairs and count the rooms.
I think the third floor is missing.

Come here with that, will you.

You can beat that,

01:22:31,212 --> 01:22:35,444
[All Laughing]
It's so funny.
I wish I could think of it.

1104
01:22:35,517 --> 01:22:37,610
Oft in the stilly night,

1105
01:22:37,686 --> 01:22:40,177
the trembling of a leaf
can be heard...

1106
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:42,587
sighing through the trees.

1107
01:22:42,657 --> 01:22:45,922
And the babbling brook,
as it wends its way onward,

1108
01:22:45,994 --> 01:22:48,053
babbling and...

1109
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:55,937
Well, I got rid of one.

1110
01:22:56,004 --> 01:22:58,939
And one like that is worth
three ordinary ones.
Where was I?

1111
01:22:59,007 --> 01:23:01,100
Oh, yes, on this chair.
That's right.

1112
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:04,111
Western cattle opened
at 15 and a quarter.

1113
01:23:04,179 --> 01:23:06,841
Yearlings and spring veal
showed a firm tone.

1114
01:23:06,915 --> 01:23:09,884
And eggs were a little touchy
on a falling market.

1115
01:23:09,951 --> 01:23:13,114
Well, my mother and father
talked it over, and they finally
moved to New York.

1116
01:23:13,188 --> 01:23:15,281
They took a little house in the Bronx.

1117
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:19,623
And it was in that little house
that Abraham Lincoln was born,
much to my father's surprise.

1118
01:23:19,694 --> 01:23:23,562
And that, boys and girls, was
the beginning of the Lincoln Highway.

1119
01:23:23,631 --> 01:23:26,395
And now, friends, in view of the fact
that Miss Potter's engagement...

1120
01:23:26,468 --> 01:23:28,902
is being celebrated here tonight,
so to speak,

1121
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:31,905
I think a few words from her mother
would be revolting.

1122
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:34,567
I now take great pleasure
in presenting to you...

1123
01:23:34,642 --> 01:23:37,406
the well-preserved
and partially pickled Mrs. Potter.

1124
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:40,414
Come on now.
Give the little girl a big hand.
Speech. Speech.

1125
01:23:40,482 --> 01:23:42,416
Big speech.
Speech. Speech.

1126
01:23:42,484 --> 01:23:44,748
My good, good friends,

1127
01:23:44,819 --> 01:23:46,912
if I could only tell you...

1128
01:23:46,988 --> 01:23:51,049
how rosy-hued everything
seems to me tonight.

1129
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:57,495
<i>As I look into your faces,</i>
<i>they're all lit with gay laughter.</i>

1130
01:24:00,001 --> 01:24:03,596
The whole world,
and everything in it,

1131
01:24:03,671 --> 01:24:08,267
is bathed in a soft,
glowing, luminous haze.

1132
01:24:08,343 --> 01:24:10,903
The old gal is stewed
to the eyebrows.

1133
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:15,575
And now I want to wish you all
a most enjoyable evening.

1134
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:18,881
As for myself, I'm sad.

1135
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:24,222
I simply can't go any farther.

1136
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:26,852
I'll get off with you.

1137
01:24:26,928 --> 01:24:31,262
Now, friends, I want to take
great pleasure in presenting to you...

1138
01:24:31,332 --> 01:24:34,358
the groom Mr. Yates,
Mr. Harvey Yates.

1139
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:41,034
Good evening, radio fans.
We are now back in the studio.

1140
01:24:41,109 --> 01:24:43,942
Stand by for your station announcer.

1141
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:47,743
My dear, dear friends,

1142
01:24:53,488 --> 01:24:55,388
<i>I,</i> uh...

1143
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:57,550
<i>I,</i> uh...

1144
01:25:01,729 --> 01:25:04,220
I, uh, really don't know
what to say.

1145
01:25:04,299 --> 01:25:06,699
Well, shut up.

1146
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:10,431
What a splendid suggestion.
Good, eh?

1147
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:13,497
I feel highly honored,

1148
01:25:13,575 --> 01:25:16,601
but I'm afraid I'm not much
of a speech maker.

1149
01:25:16,678 --> 01:25:19,772
Nevertheless, Mr. Hammer,
it was very nice of you
to call on me.

1150
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:22,442
You must call on me sometime.
I was just about to...

1151
01:25:22,517 --> 01:25:25,611
Yes, come up and see my flower bed.
What I intended to say...

1152
01:25:25,687 --> 01:25:27,951
I want you to see my pansies.
Well...

1153
01:25:28,022 --> 01:25:31,287
I got short pansies and long pansies.
I was just going to say that...

1154
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:34,385
Next spring I'm gonna get
some early bloomers.

1155
01:25:37,899 --> 01:25:40,129
As I was about to say...

1156
01:25:42,237 --> 01:25:45,434
There seems to be a steady stream
flowing in and out over there.

1157
01:25:45,507 --> 01:25:49,341
I wouldn't dream of taking up
any more of your time.

1158
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:52,072
I really wanted
to thank you all.
Yeah.

1159
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:55,913
And as I said before,
I hadn't intended to make
a speech at all.

1160
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:58,544
Well, you certainly succeeded.

1161
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:00,554
Now, friends...

1162
01:26:06,661 --> 01:26:08,595
Now what's the matter
with him?

1163
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:11,188
That's that good Gulf gas.

1164
01:26:11,266 --> 01:26:13,359
Goodness.

1165
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:18,332
I'm so sorry.

1166
01:26:24,746 --> 01:26:27,510
Hey, hey. What are you doin'?
Don't do that.

1167
01:26:27,582 --> 01:26:30,016
Come on.
That's a not a good.

1168
01:26:34,122 --> 01:26:36,215
Mr. Hammer.

1169
01:26:37,225 --> 01:26:39,216
Mr. Hammer,
can't you do something?

1170
01:26:39,294 --> 01:26:41,660
I don't have to.
They're doing plenty.
[Honks]

1171
01:26:41,729 --> 01:26:43,663
Oh, this is awful.

1172
01:26:47,101 --> 01:26:49,535
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
the, uh...

1173
01:26:49,604 --> 01:26:53,973
the first musical, uh, number
that we intend to portray...

1174
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:58,945
will be the, uh, beginning
and the ending of a very...

1175
01:26:59,013 --> 01:27:02,881
We're gonna have music.
Music. We're gonna have music.

1176
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:12,190
Now, the first musical number
on the program...

1177
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:15,423
will be a piccolo solo
which we will skip.

1178
01:27:15,496 --> 01:27:19,489
And the second number
will be Senor Pastrami,
the Lithuanian pianist.

1179
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:26,506
The Senor, for his first selection,
will play " A Cup of Coffee,
a Sandwich and You"...

1180
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:29,270
from the opera, <i>Aida.</i>

1181
01:27:29,344 --> 01:27:32,905
Senor, allow me
to escort you to the diet.

1182
01:27:32,981 --> 01:27:36,576
Uh, Senor Pastrami,
what is the first number?

1183
01:27:36,651 --> 01:27:39,415
Number one.

1184
01:27:43,791 --> 01:27:46,624
[Classical]

1185
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:51,583
And now, friends, I want to present
to you a charming little lady.

1186
01:29:52,754 --> 01:29:54,847
Down in front.
Hey, sit down.

1187
01:29:54,922 --> 01:29:58,881
What's wrong with you?
The little lady who is to become
Mrs. Harvey Yates,

1188
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:01,053
over my dead body.

1189
01:30:04,132 --> 01:30:06,896
I know I have the sincere wishes
of all my friends...

1190
01:30:06,968 --> 01:30:09,493
and can only tell you
how much I appreciate it.

1191
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:14,007
I think I can honestly say this is
the happiest moment of my life.

1192
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:16,100
Look what I have here.

1193
01:30:27,021 --> 01:30:31,287
It's a little engagement present
just given me by Mr. Yates.

1194
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:33,589
He wrote it just now,

1195
01:30:33,661 --> 01:30:37,097
but he wrote another yesterday
when a necklace was stolen.

1196
01:30:37,165 --> 01:30:41,033
They are both
in his handwriting.
Let me read it to you.

1197
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:44,094
It shows how to get to Cocoanut Manor
and the hollow tree stump...

1198
01:30:44,172 --> 01:30:47,437
and reads,
"Hollow stump, jewels."

1199
01:30:48,609 --> 01:30:52,170
I don't believe it.
See for yourself.

1200
01:30:52,246 --> 01:30:54,441
Yates is gone.
Yates is gone?

1201
01:30:54,515 --> 01:30:57,279
And I gave him a check this morning
for a thousand dollars.

1202
01:30:57,351 --> 01:31:00,787
It's a good thing
it was my personal check.
Mr. Hammer.

1203
01:31:00,855 --> 01:31:04,848
There's a man outside who wants
to see you with a black mustache.
Tell him I've got one.

1204
01:31:04,926 --> 01:31:07,520
Well, I think you
will want to see him.

1205
01:31:07,595 --> 01:31:09,688
His name is Mr. John W. Berryman.

1206
01:31:09,764 --> 01:31:13,632
He has accepted my architectural plans
for the development of Cocoanut Manor.

1207
01:31:13,701 --> 01:31:16,261
Well, happy days, old boy.
Thank you. Thank you.

1208
01:31:16,337 --> 01:31:18,669
[Italian]
Thank you.

1209
01:31:20,074 --> 01:31:23,009
He also wants to know
if you can accommodate
400 guests for the weekend.

1210
01:31:23,077 --> 01:31:25,170
400 guests?
400 guests.

1211
01:31:25,246 --> 01:31:27,806
What in the world's
the matter...

1212
01:31:27,882 --> 01:31:29,941
Mother, you must admit
you were mistaken.

1213
01:31:30,017 --> 01:31:33,077
Mr. Adams, how can you
ever forgive me?

1214
01:31:33,154 --> 01:31:35,281
Oh, please, Mrs. Potter.

1215
01:31:37,024 --> 01:31:41,859
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're all invited to attend
the wedding of my daughter.

1216
01:31:41,929 --> 01:31:45,330
The wedding will take place
exactly as planned.

1217
01:31:45,399 --> 01:31:48,163
That is, with the exception
of a slight change.

1218
01:31:48,236 --> 01:31:51,865
She will be married
to Mr. Robert Adams.

1219
01:31:51,939 --> 01:31:54,373
[All]
Hooray! Hooray!

1220
01:31:54,442 --> 01:31:57,570
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

1221
01:31:57,645 --> 01:31:59,738
The skies

1222
01:31:59,814 --> 01:32:04,376
Will all be blue

1223
01:32:04,452 --> 01:32:06,977
When my dreams

1224
01:32:07,054 --> 01:32:11,821
Come true

1225
01:32:11,893 --> 01:32:15,624
<i>And I'll be smiling</i>

1226
01:32:15,696 --> 01:32:18,062
<i>Through</i>

1227
01:32:18,132 --> 01:32:20,692
<i>When my dreams</i>

1228
01:32:20,768 --> 01:32:24,329
<i>Come true</i>

1229
01:32:24,405 --> 01:32:27,806
<i>That Spanish castle</i>

1230
01:32:27,875 --> 01:32:31,038
<i>I built in my mind</i>

1231
01:32:31,112 --> 01:32:34,309
<i>Will be our love nest</i>

1232
01:32:34,382 --> 01:32:38,751
The practical kind

1233
01:32:38,819 --> 01:32:40,753
And I'll

1234
01:32:40,821 --> 01:32:42,755
Be there

1235
01:32:42,823 --> 01:32:46,350
With you

1236
01:32:46,427 --> 01:32:50,090
When my dreams

1237
01:32:50,164 --> 01:32:53,258
Come

1238
01:32:53,334 --> 01:32:57,327
<i>True</i>
