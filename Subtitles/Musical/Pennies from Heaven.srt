1
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:50,937
Warden, where does that fellow
with the guitar hang out?

2
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,511
Down there, at the other end
of the prison.

3
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:57,345
- I'd like to see him for a while.
- Well, Hart, you know...

4
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:01,114
I'm the star boarder of this hotel
tonight. You're supposed to cater to me.

5
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:04,156
Yes, I know. But once you leave your
cell, according to regulations...

6
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,852
Oh, you can't be too technical
at a time like this.

7
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:11,162
I can't see that it'd do any harm,
Warden.

8
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,135
All right. But just
for a minute, remember.

9
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,408
Hart's the name.

10
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:37,880
Yeah, I know.
I'm glad to meet you, Hart.

11
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:39,584
Mine's Poole, Larry Poole.

12
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,961
Much obliged for the music.

13
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,793
You sure tease pretty tunes
out of that guitar.

14
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:49,426
Oh, that's not a guitar.
It's a lute, 13th century lute.

15
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,629
Whatever it is, you sure got it locked.

16
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:54,696
And you got a swell pair of pipes too.

17
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:57,766
Many's the time I heard you out there
in the yard.

18
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:01,075
It kind of took my mind off things.

19
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:04,139
The chaplain tells me
you're due out of here next week.

20
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,515
Where do you aim to go?

21
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,952
Well, it depends on the wind. You see,
with me, when I leave a place...

22
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,786
I get myself a feather
and toss it up...

23
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,588
and whichever way the wind blows,
that's where I go.

24
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:18,119
Swell. Let me toss the feather
for you this time.

25
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,723
Here's a letter I want delivered.

26
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,234
It goes to some people named Smith.

27
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:26,295
They live somewhere around Middletown,
New Jersey.

28
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,773
I don't know the address.
That's why I can't mail it.

29
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,003
Well, why do you want me
to deliver it?

30
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:35,514
Because you're the only guy around here
I can trust.

31
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:38,574
Anybody that can sing sappy,
sentimental songs in prison...

32
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,881
wouldn't double-cross
a guy taking his last walk.

33
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:43,650
It's mighty important that
that letter gets to those people.

34
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,988
- Will you deliver it for me?
- Why, I'll be glad to.

35
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,496
Thanks. Gee, that's a load
off my mind.

36
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,898
- So long.
- So long.

37
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:01,532
Okay, folks. Let's go.

38
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:18,181
<i>Come on, folks.</i>
<i>Six rings for a dime.</i>

39
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,123
A dime, six rings.

40
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:24,687
Anyone can do it.
Come on, folks, six rings for a dime.

41
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,698
A dime, six rings.

42
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,633
There you are.
Six rings for a dime, folks.

43
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,166
Six rings for a dime.

44
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,834
Step right up and ring 'em
and take home a present.

45
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,240
Hold it.

46
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,881
- What are you after?
- Them.

47
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,415
Can't be done.

48
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:47,919
Here.

49
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,716
Hey, what's the idea?

50
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,224
You see there?
No can do.

51
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:01,097
- Oh, a wise guy.
- Sister, you see that cop over there?

52
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:04,500
- Run on over and tell him...
- Now, wait a minute, pal.

53
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,834
Them opera glasses must have gotten
there by mistake.

54
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:09,841
- Mm-hmm.
- Here's your dime back.

55
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:14,972
My dime? Listen, I've been coming here
every day since this carnival opened.

56
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:18,506
I spent lots of dimes! Hundreds and
millions, and I don't want my dime back!

57
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,347
I want those opera glasses!

58
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,548
And those glasses you shall have,
unless you want to yell, "Hey, rube."

59
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:28,151
Well, if she wants them that bad,
why, she can have 'em.

60
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,825
There you are, sister.
Thank the nice man.

61
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,061
Thank you, you crook!

62
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:43,773
Gee, aren't they elegant!

63
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:47,574
Elegant? They're just the last gasp
in binoculars, that's all.

64
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,584
Hey, look. The ground comes
way up here.

65
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,592
Look out you don't step on your chin.

66
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:05,059
- What's your name?
- Larry. What's yours?

67
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:08,567
Patricia. But my intimate friends
call me Sarge.

68
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:12,502
Sarge. Oh!
Mind if I call you Sarge?

69
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:16,167
No. You're the most intimate friend
I've got. I'm awfully glad to meet you.

70
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:19,905
You're not half as glad as I am to meet
you. I've been looking all over for you.

71
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,607
Took me almost three weeks
to locate you.

72
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,674
Your name is Smith and you live
over here on Railroad Avenue.

73
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,845
- How did you know?
- I was by your house this morning.

74
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,980
The people next door told me
I'd find you here at the carnival.

75
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,651
They said to look for a little girl
with a red feather in her cap.

76
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,854
Said she had on a brown...
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!

77
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,359
Oh, no, you don't.

78
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:46,872
I had to check off 165 Smiths to find
you, and I ain't gonna lose you now.

79
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,464
- Are you a cop?
- Do I look like one?

80
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,602
Well, are you
an installment collector?

81
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:55,408
- No, I should say not.
- Then what do you want?

82
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:57,415
- I got something for you.
- What?

83
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,646
Hadn't we better tell that to the head
of the family? Is there somebody else?

84
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,984
My grandpa.
There's just me and Gramp.

85
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,353
I tell you what we'll do then.
We'll tell your gramp.

86
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,893
- If that's okay with you?
- Sure. And you can stay for lunch.

87
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,691
- Gramp's got a nice big ham.
- Why, I'd love to.

88
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:15,564
Oh, I forgot. Gramp gave me a dime
to get a loaf of bread...

89
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,195
and I spent it on the rings.

90
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:23,208
Well, if Gramp can furnish the ham,
the least I can do is furnish the bread.

91
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,040
Oops. I'm flat myself.

92
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,473
Madam, I am temporarily
without funds.

93
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,517
That's all right. We can eat
the ham without the bread.

94
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,052
Oh, we'll get pennies enough for bread.

95
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,418
- Where?
- From heaven.

96
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:54,301
<i>On a lonely road or sidewalk</i>

97
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,740
<i>It doesn't matter where</i>

98
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,576
<i>I've always felt that I'd walk</i>

99
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:06,380
<i>Into my love affair</i>

100
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,620
<i>And on that perfect day</i>

101
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:16,128
<i>I'd say</i>

102
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:23,059
<i>The breeze runs after you</i>

103
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:27,333
<i>When you're passing by</i>

104
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:33,174
<i>It wants to be near</i>

105
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,939
<i>And so do I

106
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:44,687
<i>The willow bows to you</i>

107
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:49,160
<i>Forgetting to cry</i>

108
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:55,098
<i>It waits for your smile</i>

109
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:59,063
<i>And so do I

110
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:07,442
<i>All the world's at your command</i>

111
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:10,846
<i>What wouldn't it do</i>

112
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:16,748
<i>For one look at you</i>

113
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:24,594
<i>And I'm that way too</i>

114
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,959
<i>The rose</i>

115
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:32,528
<i>That you caress</i>

116
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:37,042
<i>Is willing to die</i>

117
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:44,048
<i>It loves you so very much</i>

118
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:50,051
<i>And so</i>

119
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:53,421
<i>Do I

120
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,436
- Let's do it again!
- Oh, no, Sarge.

121
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:10,635
You give 'em a little, they throw coins.
Give 'em too much, they throw eggs.

122
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:15,204
- What do you suppose that means?
- Let's find out!

123
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,565
- Patsy!
- Hey, Sarge!

124
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,865
Wait! Come back here.

125
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,871
- What's this all about?
- That's just what I want to find out.

126
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,810
Come in.

127
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,048
Don't come close to me.
I have a cold.

128
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,587
Okay, I won't.

129
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,589
- Gesundheit.
- Thank you.

130
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,887
What were you doing down there
in that yard with Patsy?

131
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,359
Oh, we were serenading the world.

132
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:06,797
Tell me something. What made that kid
take off like a rabbit when she saw you?

133
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:10,302
Guilty conscience.
She's playing hooky.

134
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:13,668
Bless you. Say, you know that oil
of balsam is good for that.

135
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,503
Never mind oil of balsam or any other
kind of oil. Answer my question.

136
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:19,009
What makes you so interested
about this kid? What is it?

137
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,774
I work for the welfare department,
and it's my job...

138
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,940
to look after the problem children
of this county.

139
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,813
Oh, is Patsy such a problem?

140
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:28,115
Problem? I've got 20 to look after...

141
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,452
and she's more trouble
than all the rest put together.

142
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,822
- Bless you.
- Oh, stop blessing me!

143
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:37,124
That child's supposed to be in school,
and I find her dancing for pennies!

144
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,131
What's the matter with that? It keeps
the kid out in the open, doesn't it?

145
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,599
Who are you? I've never seen you
around here anyway.

146
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,431
I'm the last of the troubadours.

147
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:47,301
- If you think this is a joking matter...
- I'm not joking.

148
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,240
Seriously, I'm just a harmless guy,
the friend of man.

149
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,005
I envy nobody,
and I'm sure nobody envies me.

150
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:56,276
If I were you, I wouldn't get myself
into a temperature over this thing.

151
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,908
- It's bad for your cold.
- Never mind my cold.

152
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,509
- Not too close.
- I'm sorry.

153
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:05,580
- Are you related to Patsy?
- No, just a friend of the family.

154
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:08,593
Do you know that she's in danger
of being sent to an orphanage?

155
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:13,257
I've been trying to prevent it, but if
this goes on, I don't see how I can.

156
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:16,665
What's wrong with an orphanage? I was
raised in one. It didn't hurt me any.

157
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,432
- It didn't do you any good.
- What's the matter with me?

158
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:23,669
If you want my opinion, you seem to be
nothing more than a shiftless loafer!

159
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,179
You seem to be nothing more than
a nosey, meddlesome busybody!

160
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,181
If you'd been raised in an orphanage,
you might have learned manners!

161
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,809
I'm sorry, perhaps I was mistaken.

162
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:35,911
Perhaps you're not really a loafer,
even if you do look like one.

163
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,956
Just what do you do for a living?

164
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:42,119
Oh, I eat, drink, sleep,
and I mind my own business.

165
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:46,255
That's a formula I highly recommend,
especially the last part.

166
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,892
Well, here's your money back.

167
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,959
Guess you just don't like music.

168
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:57,774
Oh, say, I hope that cold
is nothing trivial.

169
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,564
- Hello, Gramp.
- Hello.

170
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,570
I see the landlord's been here.

171
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,369
Yes, he came with a couple of men.
They left a little while ago.

172
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,966
Oh, this is Larry,
my most intimate friend.

173
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,705
- What's your other name?
- Poole.

174
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:38,910
How do you do? I'm sorry I can't invite
you inside, but we've been dispossessed.

175
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,451
- That's too bad.
- That's all right.

176
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,613
The furniture don't belong to us.
We never have to send it back.

177
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,884
The installment people always
come after it.

178
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,892
That's nice of them, isn't it?

179
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,123
Good to see that you're not put out
about being put out.

180
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,131
No. It happens all the time.

181
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,657
Sure. We move in one house and stay
a while till the landlord puts us out.

182
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:59,863
- We never pay any rent.
- Of course that's only temporary.

183
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:03,898
Pretty soon I expect to come into
a regular income of $200 a month.

184
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,841
Quite ample for our simple needs.

185
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,880
- Larry's gonna stay for lunch.
- Delighted!

186
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,439
Provided you don't mind
dining in the open.

187
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,985
Oh, no, I prefer it.

188
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,783
- Won't you sit down?
- Show him the ham.

189
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:25,326
- Ain't it elegant?
- Oh, a dandy.

190
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:26,864
We won it at a raffle.

191
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:30,333
- Hey, look! Miss Sprague!
- Beat it!

192
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,315
Charming landscape, is it not?

193
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,925
Patsy's very good at finding
such places.

194
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:02,964
Say, Gramp, tell me something,
will you?

195
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,094
Does the name Hart
mean anything to you?

196
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,537
If you mean the criminal
who was recently electrocuted...

197
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:12,839
- That's the fellow.
- His name does mean something to me.

198
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,107
He is the man
who killed Patsy's father.

199
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,307
He gave me a letter for you.

200
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,321
Here it is.

201
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,265
A key.

202
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,061
What's it for?

203
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,601
Read the letter.

204
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,933
No, I haven't my glasses.
Will you read it for me, please?

205
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,596
Sure.

206
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,476
"You know I never meant to kill Smith.

207
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:52,005
All the time I was in prison
I kept thinking about his family...

208
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:55,076
and how they must have been
up against it after I killed him.

209
00:15:55,988 --> 00:16:01,426
So I thought I would leave all I have
to the family of this man Smith.

210
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,620
It isn't very much.
Just an old house in New Jersey...

211
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,994
that I used to use for a hideout.

212
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:10,331
I hope it brings you better luck
than it brought me.J.C. Hart."

213
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:15,465
No. No, I could never live in a house
that belonged to that man.

214
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:19,375
Why not? Probably the only decent thing
he ever tried to do.

215
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,777
Let him do it.

216
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,781
Poor fellow's dead now.

217
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:27,285
Look, you've just been thrown out
of your house, haven't you?

218
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,913
Well, here's another one all set up
and ready for you to live in.

219
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,890
Besides, you have to
think of Patsy, you know.

220
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,357
Thank you, Mr. Cow.

221
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:42,161
There's a postscript here on the letter.
Says the house is...

222
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:46,136
"on a road off the main highway
about five miles out of Middletown."

223
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:53,703
- Oh, bless my soul, child.
- Oh, dear.

224
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:58,104
<i>Old McDonald had a farm</i>
<i>E- l-E-l-O</i>

225
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,641
<i>And on the farm he had a duck</i>
<i>E- l-E-l-O</i>

226
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,449
<i>With a quack, quack here</i>
<i>And a quack, quack there</i>

227
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,217
<i>Here a quack, there a quack</i>
<i>Everywhere a quack, quack</i>

228
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,657
<i>Old McDonald had a farm</i>
<i>E- l-E-l-O</i>

229
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:12,993
<i>Oh, Patsy Smith is a pain in the neck</i>
<i>E- l-E-l-O</i>

230
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,033
<i>Yes, she is</i>
<i>She is, by heck</i>

231
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,863
<i>E- l-E-l-O</i>

232
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,698
<i>With I wanna go here</i>
<i>and I won't do that</i>

233
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,568
<i>And an old feather stuck in her hat</i>

234
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,234
<i>Patsy Smith is a pain in the neck</i>
<i>E- l-E-l-O</i>

235
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,402
- <i>Is that a guitar</i>
- <i>That's a lute</i>

236
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,605
<i>E- l-E-l-O</i>

237
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,241
<i>Whatever it is it's sure a beaut</i>
<i>E- l-E-l-O</i>

238
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,478
- <i>With</i> a...
- <i>With</i> a...

239
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:38,751
<i>Here, and</i> a... <i>there</i>
<i>Here</i> a... <i>there</i> a... <i>everywhere</i> a...

240
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:43,025
<i>Larry's got a lute</i>
<i>E- l-E-l-O</i>

241
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,892
- Hey, I know one.
- Is it a good one?

242
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:47,557
- They seem to like it around here.
- Let's hear it.

243
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,864
<i>Old McDonald had a farm</i>
<i>E- l-E-l-O</i>

244
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:54,372
<i>And on this farm he had a parrot</i>
<i>E- l-E-l-O</i>

245
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,465
<i>With a...and</i> a...

246
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,266
Did you tear something?

247
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,874
Sounded bad.

248
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:03,812
Well, here we are.

249
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,415
Partner, I want to thank you very much
for the lift.

250
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,958
That's all right.
Glad of your company.

251
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,859
Gee, mister, you can sure twang
on that there guitar.

252
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,159
- That ain't no guitar.
- It's a lute.

253
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,994
A 13th century lute!

254
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:23,534
Well, where's this house now?

255
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,160
It's up there in those trees.

256
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:27,603
She's staring you square in the face.

257
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,903
You ain't gonna stay in that house?

258
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:32,808
- Why not?
- Didn't you know that was haunted?

259
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:39,242
Why sure. We're the ghosts
that haunt it. Come, come, spirits.

260
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,222
Giddyap!

261
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:11,205
Maybe we ought to stop over
someplace in town tonight.

262
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,841
We can come in the morning.

263
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:16,149
Oh, hooey. That Hart probably started
this haunted house talk...

264
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:19,850
just to keep people
away from the hideaway.

265
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,256
Here. Hey, Gramp, let me get that.

266
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,695
Okay. Come on in.
Join the spooks.

267
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,697
Go on, dear.

268
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:10,172
Well, come on in.
Nothing to be afraid of.

269
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:02,684
What's the trouble, Sarge?
I thought you said you were grown up.

270
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:06,053
- I am.
- You promised you wouldn't be afraid.

271
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,490
I'm not afraid, only...

272
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,357
it's awful lonely in here...

273
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:13,057
and I keep seeing funny things
in the dark.

274
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:17,192
- Why don't you close your eyes?
- I do, but it gets worse.

275
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:23,233
Can I go downstairs with you, Larry?

276
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:25,333
- What a pest.
- Just for a little while.

277
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,402
- You know you're a nuisance?
- Please?

278
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:32,176
Why did I ever have to
run into you, anyhow?

279
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,220
There you are. Now stay put.

280
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:42,859
I'll be right back.

281
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,499
Let's stay up all night, huh?

282
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:54,372
I'll get Gramp's chess board,
and I'll teach you how to play the game.

283
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:59,174
No. What do I want with chess, anyhow?
I got troubles enough.

284
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:02,475
- What troubles have you got?
- Mostly you.

285
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,980
- Me?
- Yeah.

286
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,914
What's the matter with me?

287
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:09,647
You were born a female.
That was your first mistake.

288
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,212
All females are troublemakers,
one way or another.

289
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,918
They slow you down,
and they cramp your style.

290
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:16,426
Not me. I'm different.

291
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:18,429
Oh, no, you're not.

292
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,692
Your friend Miss Sprague
told me all about you.

293
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,997
Friend? She's the worst enemy
I've got in the whole world.

294
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:27,561
Never mind about that.
You just hop right in here. Come on.

295
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:36,943
Gee, this is the first time anybody
ever tucked me in bed.

296
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:40,451
- Would you do it for me every night?
- Every night?

297
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,487
What do you think I'm gonna do,
live here?

298
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,249
We could have an awful lot of fun.

299
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:47,348
Oh, no. You've held me up
long enough already.

300
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,418
- I'm leaving in the morning.
- Can I go with you?

301
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:52,759
With me? I should say not.

302
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:56,062
I don't carry any excess baggage.
That's the secret of my success.

303
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:58,500
I won't be any trouble.

304
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:03,234
Trouble's your middle name. Anyway, you
wouldn't want to leave Gramp, would you?

305
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:05,674
Oh, no, but we could take him with us.

306
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,871
Take him with us?

307
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,210
What are you figuring out for me?
A cook's tour?

308
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,614
You just forget about it.

309
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:15,152
Close those eyes, and go to sleep.

310
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,281
I can't go to sleep. I'm afraid.
The house is full of ghosts.

311
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:21,120
- Rats.
- Where?

312
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:25,562
No, no. There. Now relax.

313
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,325
You know, Sarge...

314
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:30,266
<i>A long time ago</i>

315
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:33,099
<i>About a million years BC</i>

316
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,065
<i>The best things in life</i>

317
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,938
<i>Absolutely free</i>

318
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:46,816
<i>But no one appreciated</i>

319
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:50,116
<i>A sky that was always blue</i>

320
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:53,885
<i>And no one congratulated</i>

321
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:59,192
<i>A moon that was always new</i>

322
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:04,201
<i>So it was planned</i>
<i>that they would vanish now and then</i>

323
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:09,138
<i>And you must pay before you</i>
<i>get them back again</i>

324
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:16,547
<i>That's what storms were made for</i>

325
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:22,345
<i>And you shouldn't be afraid for</i>

326
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:29,293
<i>Every time it rains</i>
<i>it rains</i>

327
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,353
<i>Pennies from heaven</i>

328
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:40,065
<i>Don't you know each cloud contains</i>

329
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:43,403
<i>Pennies from heaven</i>

330
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:50,170
<i>You'll find your fortune falling</i>

331
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:53,479
<i>All over town</i>

332
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:00,985
<i>Be sure that your umbrella</i>

333
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,894
<i>Is upside down</i>

334
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:13,535
<i>Trade them for a package of</i>

335
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:17,564
<i>Sunshine and flowers</i>

336
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:23,344
<i>If you want the things you love</i>

337
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:27,747
<i>You must have showers</i>

338
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:35,526
<i>So when you hear it thunder</i>

339
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:40,995
<i>Don't run under a tree</i>

340
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,563
<i>There'll be pennies from heaven</i>

341
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:48,970
<i>For you</i>

342
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,340
<i>And me</i>

343
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,628
Well, there.

344
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,290
Check.

345
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:49,629
That means I gotta move my king
out of danger, huh?

346
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,134
Sure.

347
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:55,138
Young lady, something tells me
you're trying to pull a fast one.

348
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:57,470
If I move my king,
you're gonna grab my rook, aren't you?

349
00:27:57,542 --> 00:28:01,808
Uh-huh. And I'll have you mated
in three moves.

350
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,007
Oh, I guess I'm no good at this game.

351
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:05,674
- Sure, you are!
- Nah.

352
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,741
You just can't learn in a week.

353
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:11,778
I've played for years,
and besides, you don't concentrate.

354
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,654
- Yes, I do.
- You're thinking of something else.

355
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:16,159
Nope.

356
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:27,696
Hey! Wait a minute.

357
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:34,235
Good afternoon. Patsy seems to have
remembered a sudden engagement.

358
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:38,009
Gee, I'd hate to be somebody that
makes children run away all the time.

359
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,142
- May I sit down?
- Don't come too close.

360
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,846
I've got a cold.
You better sit there.

361
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:46,823
How'd you know where we were?

362
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,654
My own secret service.

363
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,922
Nice of you to take
such an interest in me.

364
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:54,692
I don't take any interest in you,
not the slightest.

365
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:57,860
Then why are you snooping around here?
Why don't you mind your own business?

366
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:00,666
This is my business.
It's my job to look after Patsy...

367
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,675
and I'm not letting anyone stop me,
least of all a hobo with a guitar.

368
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,804
In the first place, it's not a guitar.
It's a lute.

369
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,875
Here, take a look at it.

370
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:16,819
It was made in the 13th century, long
before we had any nosy social workers.

371
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:22,257
Probably belonged to some troubadour.
That's me... a troubadour, not a hobo.

372
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:25,353
- What's the difference?
- The difference?

373
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,490
A hobo begs for his supper,
and a troubadour sings for it.

374
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:31,433
- How romantic.
- Yes.

375
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:34,301
- You have a nice voice too.
- Thank you.

376
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:37,603
- I suppose you eat regularly?
- Mm-hmm. Sleep regularly, and...

377
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:39,734
I know. Mind your own business.

378
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:43,303
- Right.
- Well, so do I. That's why I'm here.

379
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:47,317
Well, then I'm glad you came.
If you hadn't, I'd have sent for you...

380
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:50,149
because there's something
you can do for me.

381
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:53,247
- What?
- You can take this family off my hands.

382
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:55,588
I ought to be on a boat right now,
bound for Venice.

383
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,594
What's Venice got to do with it?

384
00:29:57,662 --> 00:30:01,291
Plenty. I've got an idea they understand
a guy with a lute over there.

385
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:04,699
It's too bad that nobody understands you
over here.

386
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:08,034
Do you know what will happen if this
family is left to their own devices?

387
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:10,165
Oh, I imagine they'll
struggle along all right.

388
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:13,369
Of course if you could convince me
that you can support them properly.

389
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:16,538
- Support them?
- Mm-hmm. Are you married?

390
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:18,047
No, I'm sane.

391
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,512
Well, have you anybody at all
that you have to take care of?

392
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,281
Yeah... me...

393
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:25,686
and I'm not picking up anybody else.

394
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:28,225
You're not gonna stick me
with a kid and an old man.

395
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:32,321
The first time I met you, I said
some things that I shouldn't have...

396
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:34,388
so I came here to apologize.

397
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:37,127
But I see now I was right
the first time.

398
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:38,897
Hey, my lute!

399
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:10,825
What's the trouble?

400
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:13,735
I thought you were
my most intimate friend.

401
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:16,205
Well, who said I wasn't?

402
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,572
I heard you tell her
that you don't want me.

403
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:22,909
Well, I had to tell her something
to get rid of her, didn't I?

404
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:25,245
And I heard you tell her
you were gonna leave us.

405
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,084
Why don't you be reasonable?
Look.

406
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:33,612
How long do you want me to hang around,
and why do you want me to?

407
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,751
I've fallen in love with you.

408
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,133
When did this happen?

409
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:50,700
When you got me these. And I'll give
them to you if you'll only stay.

410
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:55,344
You're the worst pest
I ever ran into.

411
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,347
Come on. Get outta there.

412
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:04,420
Alley-oop.

413
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,093
Alley-oop.

414
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,120
That's the old sergeant.

415
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:21,605
Here are the commitment papers
for the Smith child.

416
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:23,106
Yes, sir.

417
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:26,541
If they'd been prepared weeks ago, you
could have saved considerable trouble.

418
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,306
You're quite right, Mr. Carmichael.

419
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:32,816
See that the child is taken to the
orphanage in the morning. That's all.

420
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,721
Get me the orphanage.

421
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:47,096
Come in.

422
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:54,103
- Well, good morning.
- Good morning.

423
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:57,437
- I thought you were going to Rome.
- Venice.

424
00:32:57,508 --> 00:33:00,170
Oh, yes, of course. Venice.

425
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:03,372
Well, I've postponed that, but I've
been postponing it all my life...

426
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,473
so once more won't hurt.

427
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,677
We have a proposition
we want to make.

428
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:09,344
Won't you be seated?

429
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,853
You bet.

430
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:20,988
There's no need to hide.
Move your chair out there.

431
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:25,058
We have a problem, a situation that
confronts a lot of people these days.

432
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:26,728
We want to be let alone.

433
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:30,900
That's all we ask of the United States,
New Jersey, Union County and you.

434
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:35,912
If you'll just tell us what you want of
us, we'll see what we can do about it.

435
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,744
All I want is to see Patsy
properly provided for.

436
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,681
What do you mean,
"properly provided for"?

437
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:43,118
I mean properly
clothed and properly fed...

438
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,485
in a home where her schooling
won't be neglected...

439
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:47,888
where she won't be subjected
to the wrong sort of influence.

440
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,620
Oh. Meaning me.

441
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,993
- If the shoe fits.
- It pinches.

442
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:56,298
Hey, where are you going?

443
00:33:56,367 --> 00:34:00,565
I won't live with anybody else but you
and Gramp! And they can't make me!

444
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:03,937
Come on back and sit down,
or I'll walk out on the whole thing.

445
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:06,340
As I understand it
your chief objection...

446
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:10,609
is neither Gramp nor I is what you'd
call regularly or gainfully employed.

447
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:12,205
- Correct.
- Well.

448
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:16,652
If I can show you we're engaged in a
going business, would that be all right?

449
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,949
What kind?

450
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:21,856
We went into a little huddle
and decided to open a restaurant.

451
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:23,917
We're gonna call it
"The Haunted House Cafe."

452
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,657
- It was my own idea.
- Quiet, Patsy. Now, listen.

453
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:30,189
The place where we happen to be living
has the reputation of being haunted.

454
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:31,963
So why not take advantage of it?

455
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:34,834
We plan to put a lot of signs up
and down the state highway.

456
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,601
Yeah. Signs like skeletons.

457
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:39,939
And we propose to serve chicken dinners
at very reasonable rates.

458
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:43,378
There will be music and songs
provided by Mr. Poole here.

459
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:44,915
A little floor show.

460
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:48,179
Have any of you thought of
a little thing like capital?

461
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:51,278
Oh, we won't need any...
not for chicken dinners.

462
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:53,915
I have it all figured out right here.

463
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:56,255
All we need to start is two chickens.

464
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:59,194
I mean a hen and a rooster.

465
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:03,427
When the hen starts laying
at the rate of only one egg a day...

466
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,867
at the end of the first week
we'll have seven eggs.

467
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:10,431
Those seven eggs in turn will hatch,
and at the end of the second cycle...

468
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:13,875
there will be 49 chickens.

469
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:18,143
Oh, Patsy. How many chickens will we
have in three months at that rate?

470
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:20,446
- 2,401.
- You see?

471
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:22,782
It's simply a matter of arithmetic.

472
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:25,846
There! Are you satisfied,
Miss Sprague?

473
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:27,948
No.

474
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,186
I still say what about capital?

475
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,786
- What for?
- What for!

476
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:37,562
Why, for kitchen equipment!
For pots, pans, knives, forks...

477
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:42,538
We're not worrying about finances. Gramp
tells me he's coming into some money.

478
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,768
- When?
- In the very near future.

479
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:48,141
Any day now.
And regular income too.

480
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:50,077
How much of an income?

481
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,082
Two hundred dollars a month.

482
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:56,312
Two hun... From what source?

483
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:00,224
- The Townsend Plan.
- The Town...

484
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:09,127
Oh, I see. Well, just for the sake
of argument, of course...

485
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,193
suppose the Townsend Plan doesn't go
into effect until after you've started.

486
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:16,069
- Then what?
- Your attitude is unfair.

487
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,075
Of course we need capital.
Why don't you let me take care of that?

488
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:21,134
How? Singing in backyards?

489
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:23,476
Well, that's my problem.

490
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:27,382
If we can get away with this thing, is
it all right? Will you leave us alone?

491
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:30,011
Yes. I'll leave you alone.

492
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:33,454
As a matter of fact, I'd like very much
never to have to see you again.

493
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:36,624
You'd be surprised
how unanimous that is.

494
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,924
Come on, group.

495
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:58,842
Poor, homeless little chickies.

496
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:14,020
Looks elegant. Looks real nice.
I couldn't have done better myself.

497
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:16,259
- Looks effective.
- You bet it does.

498
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:17,767
That'll be $25.

499
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,769
Deliver it, will you,
and send me the bill?

500
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:23,295
- That's cash.
- Cash?

501
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:26,138
- I'll have to paint one myself.
- Wait a minute!

502
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,678
You've got no license ordering signs
without you can pay for them.

503
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,909
You're right. I did wrong.
You keep the sign.

504
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:33,974
But I don't want it.
I got no use for it.

505
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:36,986
Well, I do want it.
I've got some use for it.

506
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,485
Say, do you like chicken dinners?

507
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,857
- Well, yes.
- That's our out.

508
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:49,791
Now, the Excelsior Company is putting up
$1,500 worth of supplies...

509
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:52,836
in exchange for 25% of our business.

510
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:57,169
Your estimate for the costumes for the
waiter and entertainers is only $1,000.

511
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:59,175
But we're not asking you
to take a cut.

512
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:01,541
We're gonna give you 25% too.

513
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,274
And it's a grand chance
to get in on the ground floor.

514
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:06,282
Ground floor of what?

515
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,284
What's your secretary's name?

516
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:11,014
Myrtle. Why?

517
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:15,491
Hello, Myrt? Don't put any calls
through here for ten minutes. Right.

518
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:20,731
Tell me, Mr. Arbuthnot, what do you
think of the restaurant business?

519
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,824
Well, people's got to eat.
It's the best business there is.

520
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,369
- Good! You're in it.
- Huh?

521
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:28,803
Here it is a week.

522
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:32,570
There ought to be a couple dozen
chickens, and there's only two.

523
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:46,250
- Good morning, Mr. Poole.
- Hello, Henry. Make up your mind?

524
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,657
Yes, sir, Mr. Poole.
But there's a little trouble.

525
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:52,628
Trouble? Well, speak freely.

526
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:55,188
You see, I got the boys together...

527
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:58,702
and I told them you wanted us to play
the music for you at the restaurant.

528
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:03,138
- That's right.
- We'd get ten percent of the business.

529
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:07,541
- And that's where the trouble started.
- Don't you think ten percent is enough?

530
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:09,579
Yes and no.

531
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:12,013
Maybe it's enough,
and maybe it's too much.

532
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:15,348
But you see, there's seven men
in the band.

533
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:18,286
- That's counting you.
- Yeah, that's right. Counting me.

534
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:22,383
And none of us knows how to divide up
ten percent by seven.

535
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,588
So if you could just
only make it seven percent.

536
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:29,360
Seven percent?
Henry, it's a deal.

537
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:31,958
Oh, thank you, Mr. Poole!

538
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,266
I told them cats
you'd do the right thing.

539
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:38,866
Why, sure!
I'll see you later. Yes.

540
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:41,503
What is the matter with them?

541
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:46,243
I don't know. I've tried everything,
including prayer.

542
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:47,909
- Are you Mr. Poole?
- Why?

543
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:50,146
I have a telegram for you.

544
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,384
- Collect?
- No. Prepaid.

545
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:55,721
Well then, I'm Mr. Poole.

546
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,351
Sign right here, please.

547
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:12,373
Well.

548
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:14,604
- I'll tell you what's wrong.
- Yes?

549
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:16,612
- You see that one there?
- Yeah.

550
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,942
That's a hen.

551
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:19,915
Yes. I know. I know.

552
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:22,316
- See that one over there?
- You mean the rooster?

553
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:24,877
That ain't no rooster.

554
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:26,582
What is it?

555
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:29,820
Hey, what's going on here?
We're supposed to open tomorrow night.

556
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:32,829
I find you gazing at a hen
and a rooster!

557
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:35,092
- Two hens, Mr. Poole.
- Disaster.

558
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:39,068
We've just discovered there can be
no increase in the poultry department.

559
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:42,230
It's a beautiful time for that
to happen. What about tomorrow night?

560
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:45,241
How are we gonna feed customers
with only two hens?

561
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:49,172
Mr. Poole, when do you have to have
them chickens?

562
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:51,840
We gotta have them the first thing
in the morning!

563
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:54,942
First thing in the morning?
And how many do you say you need?

564
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:58,250
- Gotta have at least 50.
- At least 50.

565
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:02,190
How many chickens does each man have
to get when you need 50 chickens...

566
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:04,318
and you's got seven men?

567
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:07,956
Well, if each man got seven chickens,
that would be forty-nine.

568
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:11,126
Forty-nine.
Well, I think we can do it.

569
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,193
- You can?
- Yes, sir.

570
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:18,139
If you do, I'll make it 14% instead of
seven. That's two percent apiece.

571
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,473
- Now I know we can do it!
- Swell.

572
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:22,478
I'll tell you just how
we're gonna go about it.

573
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:26,607
- Yeah?
- As it gets dark tonight...

574
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,391
<i>There's an old deserted mansion</i>

575
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:43,692
<i>On an old forgotten road</i>

576
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:49,335
<i>Where the better ghosts and goblins</i>
<i>always hang out</i>

577
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:54,544
<i>One night they threw a party</i>

578
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,806
<i>In a manner a la mode</i>

579
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:03,880
<i>And they cordially invited</i>
<i>all the gang out</i>

580
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:07,856
<i>At a dark, bewitching hour</i>

581
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:12,423
<i>When the fun was loud and hearty</i>

582
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:16,459
<i>A notorious wallflower</i>

583
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,435
<i>Became the life of the party</i>

584
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:22,802
<i>The spooks were having</i>
<i>their midnight fling</i>

585
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,967
<i>Merrymaking was in full swing</i>

586
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:31,504
<i>They shrieked themselves</i>
<i>into a cheerful trance</i>

587
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:37,209
<i>When the skeleton in the closet</i>
<i>started to dance</i>

588
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:42,557
<i>Now a goblin, he giggled</i>
<i>with fiendish glee</i>

589
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:45,652
<i>A shout rang out from a big banshee</i>

590
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:50,632
<i>Amazement was in every ghostly glance</i>

591
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:54,800
<i>When the skeleton in the closet</i>

592
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:58,501
<i>Started to dance</i>

593
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,875
<i>Now all the witches were in stitches</i>

594
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:05,382
<i>While his steps made rhythmic thumps</i>

595
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:09,351
<i>And they nearly dropped</i>
<i>their broomsticks</i>

596
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,354
<i>When he tried to do the bumps</i>

597
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:15,688
<i>You never heard such unearthly laughter</i>

598
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:19,058
<i>Or such hilarious groans</i>

599
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:22,098
<i>When the skeleton in the closet</i>

600
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:26,068
<i>Rattled his bones</i>

601
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:09,624
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
That cat don't want no more of me.

602
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,294
I'm telling you that much.
Look out there.

603
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:14,303
One and two!

604
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:26,273
I made a deal to get my meals free.
See the boss.

605
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:30,516
I don't pay any checks around here.
I'm one of the owners.

606
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:42,196
<i>I don't know the art</i>
<i>of elocution</i>

607
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:46,760
<i>I'm no good at thinking on my feet</i>

608
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:51,570
<i>I make no poetic contribution</i>

609
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:56,170
<i>Even when you offer me a seat</i>

610
00:46:56,246 --> 00:47:01,946
<i>I've thrown away expressions</i>
<i>one by one</i>

611
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:04,487
<i>I'm at a loss</i>

612
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:10,460
<i>And something must be done</i>

613
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:15,555
<i>When we're in a friendly situation</i>

614
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:18,192
<i>My conversation</i>

615
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,600
<i>May not be smart</i>

616
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:25,631
<i>But if we're to have</i>
<i>a perfect understanding</i>

617
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:30,169
<i>Let's call a heart a heart</i>

618
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:35,508
<i>There are words</i>
<i>that should be whispered gently</i>

619
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:37,781
<i>That's evidently</i>

620
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,847
<i>The way to start</i>

621
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:46,055
<i>If I tell you what my dreams</i>
<i>have been demanding</i>

622
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:51,362
<i>Let's call a heart a heart</i>

623
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:55,503
<i>Can I prove how I yearn</i>

624
00:47:55,572 --> 00:48:00,009
<i>Just by the turn of a phrase</i>

625
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:03,740
<i>Can I keep my control</i>

626
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:09,816
<i>When all my soul is ablaze</i>

627
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:16,282
<i>Maybe you would call</i>
<i>a true confession</i>

628
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:20,162
<i>An indiscretion</i>

629
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:24,564
<i>On someone's part</i>

630
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:30,372
<i>But if I'm to say how madly</i>

631
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,431
<i>I adore you</i>

632
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:37,741
<i>Let's call a heart</i>

633
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:41,545
<i>A heart</i>

634
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:56,561
And let's call a spade a spade too.

635
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:59,534
If your menu had any humble pie,
I'd eat it.

636
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,629
I was wrong,
and I humbly apologize.

637
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:06,107
There's no doubt about it,
the cafe is a tremendous success...

638
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:08,144
and I didn't think you could do it.

639
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:12,739
Oh, I had to. You made me do it.
Did you enjoy your dinner?

640
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:14,807
- Very much.
- Music okay?

641
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:16,716
Mm-hmm. It's delightful.

642
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,584
- You like the looks of the place?
- Charming.

643
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:22,989
Look. If I could show you where we could
put this place on a paying basis...

644
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:26,655
so it could provide a comfortable income
for Patsy and Gramp...

645
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,664
would you be satisfied?

646
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:31,895
I'd be more than satisfied.
I'd be awfully happy.

647
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,732
Then everybody'd be happy.

648
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,465
- You too?
- Me too.

649
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:38,167
'Cause then I'd be
on my way to Venice.

650
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:40,675
Why are you so keen about Venice?

651
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:43,008
Ah, you wouldn't ask that
if you'd ever been there.

652
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,878
It's the most beautiful spot
in the world.

653
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:49,510
Why, Venice has got all the postcards
you've ever seen whipped to a frazzle.

654
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:52,783
You haven't lived until you've floated
down the Grand Canal in a gondola...

655
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:56,155
especially on a feast day with
the colored lights and the flowers...

656
00:49:56,226 --> 00:49:58,660
and the people singing and laughing,
and guitars.

657
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:00,458
You know a great deal about Venice.

658
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:03,260
Were you by any chance born there?

659
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:06,427
No. I was born in Mukilteo, Washington.

660
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:09,505
But you've spent
a great deal of time in Venice.

661
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:12,804
No. I've never been there.

662
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:15,003
But I wanted to go ever since I was
a little sprout...

663
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:17,308
but it looked as though
every time I got set to go...

664
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:20,111
something happened
and sent me somewhere else.

665
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:23,175
As, for instance, prison?

666
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:27,916
How'd you know about that?

667
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:31,085
I checked up. It was for my own
information, of course.

668
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:32,890
I didn't let them know
at the office.

669
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:36,364
I guess you found out
what I was in for, didn't you?

670
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:38,867
Smuggling.

671
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:42,496
Yeah.
That was on account of Venice too.

672
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:45,040
See, I didn't have enough dough to take
passage on a regular ship...

673
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:47,576
so I stowed away on a freighter...

674
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:49,612
and they raided the freighter before
they got up anchor.

675
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:53,809
Turned out to be a smuggling ship.
Judge wouldn't believe me.

676
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:57,320
- I guess you don't either, do you?
- Yes, I do.

677
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:59,719
You do?

678
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:01,223
Well, come here.

679
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:08,031
What made you do that?

680
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:12,364
Oh, I don't know.
I just played an impulse.

681
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,936
I guess I wanted to see
what it was like.

682
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:19,100
It was swell.
Your lips are nice and cool.

683
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:23,010
- You don't mind an audience, do you?
- Not in the least.

684
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,344
Do you mind if I obey
an impulse too?

685
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:28,613
Not at all.

686
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:30,653
Good night, Mr. Poole.

687
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:36,350
Check, sir.

688
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:41,959
Just skip it, sonny.
I'm one of the big owners of the place.

689
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:48,071
Say, mister, you better
get yourself a new waiter.

690
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:51,665
I just figured out the checks,
and everybody seems to be a partner.

691
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:55,142
The way it adds up,
you've sold 110% of this restaurant!

692
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:58,670
I agreed to work here for my tips,
and there aren't no tips.

693
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:01,410
The only paying customer was
that dame that just left.

694
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:03,885
She gimme a dime.
Here, you take it.

695
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,445
You might need it.
And here's your ribs.

696
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:11,293
Might need those too.

697
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:12,851
Good-bye.

698
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:27,870
- You Mr. Poole?
- Yeah.

699
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:30,003
You run this place?

700
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,207
Well, in a manner of speaking, yes.

701
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:34,045
Well, where's your license?

702
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:35,778
What license?

703
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:37,820
Don't you know you need
a tavern license...

704
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:40,686
to operate an eatin' place
in this county?

705
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:43,055
Drat. Now, how could I have
overlooked that?

706
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:45,424
Certainly glad you dropped in
to remind me.

707
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:48,293
Just what does
one of these licenses cost?

708
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:51,493
$100, and you can't start
doing business without one.

709
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:53,502
Well, naturally.

710
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:56,300
Say, have you got a card
you can let me have?

711
00:52:57,908 --> 00:53:01,400
Thanks. I'll be down to take care of it
first thing in the morning.

712
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:02,877
Okay.

713
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:05,744
We open at 9:00.

714
00:53:13,723 --> 00:53:17,420
Oh, now looka here. You told me
you were gonna stay upstairs.

715
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:19,792
Oh, I just couldn't stay up there.

716
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:23,993
When I saw Miss Sprague leave, I just
had to come down for one little look.

717
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:29,435
- Ain't it an elegant opening night?
- You mean "closing night."

718
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:31,337
Sergeant, you see gathered
about you tonight...

719
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:34,275
more deadheads than have ever been
collected under a single roof.

720
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:37,836
And they're all in on rain checks.
The headwaiter just quit too.

721
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:40,610
When our entertainers find out
what their percentage is...

722
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:42,709
I have an idea
they'll also quit.

723
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:45,983
We got bills up to here.
The tax collector was in to tell me...

724
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,217
if we don't get a license,
he's gonna close us up.

725
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:51,624
The license costs $100,
and we haven't got a hundred cents.

726
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:55,153
Gee, what are we gonna do?

727
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,200
Let's dance.

728
00:54:12,182 --> 00:54:16,084
- Madam, you know you dance divinely?
- Thank you. You dance elegant yourself.

729
00:54:23,526 --> 00:54:26,586
Good evening, gentlemen.
Some nice chicken dinners tonight?

730
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:30,690
See? What did I tell ya?
There they are!

731
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:33,565
Those are the fellas
that stole our chickens!

732
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:35,901
Come on!

733
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:38,133
Look out!
The law, gentlemen!

734
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:44,740
What's the trouble?

735
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:59,153
- If you let us have a little while...
- You're breakin' the law as it is.

736
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:02,392
I'll give you only 24 hours
to get that license.

737
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:11,173
There's no work
attached to it whatsoever.

738
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:14,540
And the pay is incredulous...
a dollar a second.

739
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:17,637
Thirty dollars for thirty seconds,
twice a day.

740
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:19,841
Doin' what?

741
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:29,916
You know, this guy Devlin I was usin' to
do these loop the loops, he was no good.

742
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:33,394
No. In fact, he did me a favor
when he got cracked up.

743
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:35,954
We're gonna get a lot
of publicity from this accident.

744
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:39,763
And from now on, we'll do a world
of business. Well, what do you say?

745
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:42,202
What do I know about
death in the afternoon?

746
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:44,399
Don't pay any attention to that.
That's just the billin'.

747
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:54,149
Hello?

748
00:55:58,822 --> 00:56:01,689
Hello?
Oh, hello, Larry.

749
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:05,159
What? Over to the fairgrounds?
Patsy and me?

750
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:08,664
All right. Yeah, surely.
We'll be right over.

751
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:15,264
It's Larry. He wants us
to come over to the fairgrounds.

752
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:18,102
He says it's a surprise.
Come on. Let's go.

753
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:19,641
Wait.

754
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:32,685
- Wonder where Larry is.
- He doesn't hurry, he'll miss the show.

755
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:39,393
Gee, that's gettin' higher
all the time.

756
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:41,589
- Which one loops the loop?
- The front one.

757
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:43,655
Okay, I'll ride
the back one.

758
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:46,133
- No. I've got a dummy nailed in there.
- A dummy?

759
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:49,763
Yes. Listen, you got nothing
to be afraid of. It's child's play.

760
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:54,242
- Why don't you do it yourself?
- Well, who's gonna make the spiel?

761
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:08,145
Grandpa! Grandpa, look!
It's Larry!

762
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:25,165
Now, ladies and gentlemen, I take
great pleasure in introducing to you...

763
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:28,176
the one and only
Dare Devil Devlin...

764
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:32,237
in the most daring act
ever conceived by mortal mind...

765
00:57:32,315 --> 00:57:35,910
or executed
by man born of woman.

766
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:40,422
He'll thumb his nose, ladies
and gentlemen, at the Grim Reaper!

767
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:46,019
He will defy death.
The one and only Dare Devil Devlin!

768
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:45,182
Are you ready?

769
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:51,058
- No, can't handle it.
- Okay! Let her go!

770
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:13,782
Larry, are you hurt?

771
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:18,549
No, I'm all right, Sarge.
I must've stubbed my toe.

772
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:20,054
Don't worry, kid.

773
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:22,785
- The hospital expenses are on me.
- Please, get some water.

774
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:39,741
Hey, Gramp! Come on in!

775
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:47,616
Well, what's the matter?

776
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:51,051
What's happened?
Where's Patsy?

777
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,418
She's gone.

778
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:55,616
They've taken her away.

779
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,328
An officer is on his way
to the orphanage now with the child.

780
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:10,236
Yes, Miss Howard,
a most troublesome case.

781
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:14,208
- I'm glad it's finally settled.
- May I be the first to congratulate you?

782
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:19,839
Would you mind explaining
why you saw fit...

783
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:22,646
to have a hearing about the Smith child
without telling me?

784
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:25,119
We decided we didn't need
your help in the matter.

785
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:27,884
This is my case.
You had no right to go over my head.

786
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:30,619
I'm under the impression
that I'm still the head of this bureau.

787
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:33,753
That may be, but it's no excuse
for what you've done.

788
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:36,628
You took advantage of the fact that
Mr. Poole is lying in the hospital...

789
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:38,462
to send that child to an asylum.

790
01:00:38,534 --> 01:00:40,559
It doesn't alter the fact
that he's a penniless hobo.

791
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:44,505
No, he's not.
He's a free soul and lives a free life.

792
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:46,508
I only wish I had the courage
to be like him.

793
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:50,774
That gal did it. She took advantage
of the fact I'm in the hospital.

794
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:54,180
And they left instructions
not to let you come to the orphanage.

795
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,878
- That's part of the court order.
- Yeah.

796
01:00:56,953 --> 01:01:01,151
- She took care of that too, I suppose.
- Oh, my boy, please get back in bed.

797
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:03,658
Remember, you're still in bandages.

798
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:06,286
Yes, and that's her fault too.
Everything's her fault!

799
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:09,695
Hadn't been for her, I'd be in Venice
now havin' the time of my life.

800
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:12,326
I regret to have to say
this to you.

801
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:14,666
Up to now you've been
a faithful and trustworthy worker.

802
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:16,671
I know.
You're going to give me the air.

803
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:21,039
I could do with some air. I never knew
till now how stuffy it is in here.

804
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:44,132
You don't have to
run away from me now.

805
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:47,700
- What do you want?
- I want to help you.

806
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:51,206
Oh, no, you don't. You hate me.
You've always hated me.

807
01:01:51,274 --> 01:01:53,936
That's why I'm here now.
It's all your fault.

808
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:57,002
Maybe it's my fault,
but it's not because I hate you.

809
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,446
Oh, I wish we could
be good friends.

810
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:02,040
- You couldn't be a friend of mine.
- Why not?

811
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:03,608
Because you don't get along
with Larry.

812
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:05,677
He's the most intimate friend I've got
in the world...

813
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:07,188
and you're against him.

814
01:02:07,256 --> 01:02:12,284
No, I'm not. Mr. Carmichael fired me
because I stood up for him.

815
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:14,295
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

816
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:17,696
And I had nothing to do with you being
sent here. I didn't even know about it.

817
01:02:17,767 --> 01:02:21,430
Why, you didn't see me at
the court hearing, did you?

818
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:25,572
Larry always said as soon
as he could get rid of you...

819
01:02:25,641 --> 01:02:27,871
he's gonna take me
and Gramp to Venice.

820
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:30,139
That's in Italy.

821
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:32,841
He thought maybe over there
they'd leave him alone.

822
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:36,214
That's the ambition of his life...
to be let alone.

823
01:02:36,285 --> 01:02:39,049
Do you know
the ambition of my life?

824
01:02:39,122 --> 01:02:43,616
To get you to like me and trust me
and not run away every time you see me.

825
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:46,093
- But l...
- Come closer.

826
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:48,255
I want to tell you something.

827
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:50,925
Oh, no, real close.
It's a secret.

828
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:56,064
Promise never to tell
a living soul, especially Larry.

829
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:58,107
Well...

830
01:02:58,174 --> 01:03:00,301
I like Larry very much.

831
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:05,508
And I like you too.
I always have.

832
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:08,072
Oh, Miss Sprague.

833
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:15,649
- Perhaps he's asleep.
- I'll see.

834
01:03:36,913 --> 01:03:38,847
Oh, dear!

835
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:43,877
Look, Crowbar, you know all
the circus people around here.

836
01:03:43,953 --> 01:03:47,150
You round them up to play a benefit
at the orphanage. I'll do the rest.

837
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:55,720
- Mrs. Howard.
- Good afternoon.

838
01:03:55,798 --> 01:03:57,732
It was so generous
of the carnival people...

839
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,200
to come here and give
this show for the children.

840
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:02,396
They're having
the time of their lives!

841
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:55,981
Why aren't you down in the yard
with the rest of the children?

842
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,049
I wanna stay up here.

843
01:04:58,127 --> 01:05:01,119
The circus people have been kind enough
to give a special show for us.

844
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:04,132
- It'll be starting in a few minutes.
- I don't care.

845
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:08,193
The yard's full of clowns
and jugglers and acrobats.

846
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:10,432
Bet there's a cage
full of wild animals.

847
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:13,066
I hope they run loose
and kill a few people.

848
01:05:13,142 --> 01:05:17,135
There's a golden chariot
and performing pigs...

849
01:05:17,213 --> 01:05:21,081
and the fattest woman in the world
and the tallest man.

850
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:23,084
I'm sure you'd have
an awfully good time.

851
01:05:23,152 --> 01:05:25,712
How can you have a good time
when your heart's breaking?

852
01:05:25,788 --> 01:05:28,655
- Hearts do not break.
- That's all you know about it.

853
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:30,954
I take it, then,
you don't intend to come down.

854
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:35,657
No, I swore I'd never leave this room
till they carried me out dead!

855
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:39,767
Well, good-bye then.

856
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:50,008
<i>Every time it rains</i>
<i>it rains</i>

857
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:53,071
<i>Pennies from heaven</i>

858
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:58,177
<i>Don't you know</i>
<i>each cloud contains</i>

859
01:05:58,254 --> 01:06:00,085
<i>Pennies from heaven</i>

860
01:06:00,156 --> 01:06:02,784
Now listen.

861
01:06:02,858 --> 01:06:05,622
I know you got other things
to think about...

862
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:09,722
but can't you find some way
to get me out of here?

863
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:11,061
Can't you think of something?

864
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:16,332
- <i>Be sure that your umbrella</i>
- Can't you...

865
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:21,104
<i>Is upside down</i>

866
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:24,169
<i>Get yourself a package of</i>

867
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:28,514
<i>Sunshine and flowers</i>

868
01:06:28,584 --> 01:06:32,384
<i>If you want</i>
<i>the things you love</i>

869
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:36,783
<i>You must have showers</i>

870
01:06:41,263 --> 01:06:43,823
<i>One, two</i>
<i>Button your shoe</i>

871
01:06:43,899 --> 01:06:47,494
<i>Put on your coat and hat</i>

872
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:49,800
<i>I play a game like that</i>

873
01:06:49,872 --> 01:06:53,137
<i>While I'm waiting for you</i>

874
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:56,542
<i>Three, four</i>
<i>Open the door</i>

875
01:06:56,612 --> 01:06:59,376
<i>Hurry, for heaven's sake</i>

876
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:01,848
<i>I count each step you take</i>

877
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:05,546
<i>While I'm waiting for you</i>

878
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:11,526
<i>Five, six, my heart does tricks</i>
<i>as I picture all your charms</i>

879
01:07:11,594 --> 01:07:14,290
<i>Seven, eight</i>
<i>You're at the gate</i>

880
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:16,888
<i>And you walk into my arms</i>

881
01:07:16,966 --> 01:07:20,697
<i>Oh, nine, ten</i>
<i>Kiss me again</i>

882
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:23,534
<i>Tell me you get a thrill</i>

883
01:07:23,606 --> 01:07:25,767
<i>Just as I hope you will</i>

884
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:28,935
<i>While I'm waiting for you</i>

885
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:32,879
<i>One, two</i>
<i>Button up your shoe</i>

886
01:07:32,948 --> 01:07:35,610
<i>Put on your coat</i>
<i>and your hat</i>

887
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:37,811
<i>I play a game like that</i>

888
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:41,448
<i>While I'm waiting for you</i>

889
01:07:41,524 --> 01:07:44,049
<i>Three, four, open the door</i>

890
01:07:44,126 --> 01:07:47,061
<i>Now hurry, dear</i>
<i>Hurry, for heaven's sake</i>

891
01:07:47,129 --> 01:07:50,155
<i>I count each step you take</i>

892
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:53,133
<i>While I'm waitin'for you</i>

893
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:55,762
<i>Oh, five, six</i>

894
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:59,535
<i>Now my heart does tricks</i>
<i>as I picture all your charms</i>

895
01:07:59,608 --> 01:08:03,135
<i>Seven, eight</i>
<i>You're at the gate</i>

896
01:08:03,212 --> 01:08:06,272
<i>And you make me dizzy when you're</i>
<i>walking right into my arms</i>

897
01:08:06,348 --> 01:08:09,579
<i>Nine, ten, kiss me again</i>

898
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:12,678
<i>Tell me you get such a thrill</i>

899
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:18,250
<i>Just as I hope you will</i>
<i>while I'm waitin'for you</i>

900
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:39,138
- Hi. Now, here's the plan.
- What plan?

901
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:42,878
- You're checking out of here.
- Larry! And I thought she was kiddin'.

902
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:45,147
- Who was kidding?
- Susan Sprague.

903
01:08:45,221 --> 01:08:46,950
She promised
she'd get me out of here.

904
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:50,014
Get you out of here? If it wasn't
for her, you wouldn't be here.

905
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:53,584
That female Iscariot framed you
the moment I turned my back.

906
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:57,291
That's what I thought. But she said
she didn't have anything to do with it.

907
01:08:57,366 --> 01:09:00,392
- She even lost her job because of us.
- How do you know?

908
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:02,903
She was in to see me,
and she told me.

909
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:06,373
- And she said that she... Oh. Oh.
- Well, what did she say?

910
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:10,606
Well, she made me promise not to tell
a living soul, especially you.

911
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:13,546
- Tell me! Tell me now!
- Oh, it's nothing important.

912
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:15,743
It's a secret.
Do you want me to break my word?

913
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:19,083
I'll break your neck
if you don't tell me. Come on.

914
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:22,682
Well, she said she liked you...

915
01:09:23,626 --> 01:09:25,685
a lot, an awful lot.

916
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:29,094
She says the first time she saw you,
she fell in love with you.

917
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,633
And the more she saw you
the worse it got.

918
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,930
- And she said that...
- Now listen.

919
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:38,372
If you're lying to me, I'm gonna let you
stay in this place till you're 108!

920
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:43,275
Oh, but I'm not lying, Larry.
I'd never tell a lie.

921
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:45,370
Now look, here's
what we're gonna do.

922
01:09:56,225 --> 01:09:59,319
She ate too much spinach.

923
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:02,121
Come here.

924
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:07,800
Come on. Make it fast.
Come on!

925
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:47,666
Five, six...

926
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:51,905
seven, eight...

927
01:10:53,215 --> 01:10:55,149
nine, ten.

928
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:42,796
That's the man.

929
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:48,093
Susan Sprague's in New York, and
that's the place to find Larry Poole.

930
01:11:56,111 --> 01:11:57,578
Come in.

931
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:01,240
- Miss Sprague?
- Yes.

932
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:03,683
- We're from the police department.
- What can I do for you?

933
01:12:03,752 --> 01:12:07,119
Now don't be alarmed. We just came up
to get a little information.

934
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:11,250
- What about?
- We're trying to find a Larry Poole.

935
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:14,296
Well, what makes you think
that I know his whereabouts?

936
01:12:14,363 --> 01:12:18,060
The last thing he said before he left
was that he was gonna look for you.

937
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:20,863
What do you want him for?
What are the charges against him?

938
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:22,665
Who said there was a charge?

939
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:25,536
We wanna have a few words
with the man, that's all.

940
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:28,303
I suppose that anything
I say will be used against me.

941
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:30,743
Not at all.
We got nothin' on you.

942
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:32,872
It's Larry Poole we're after.

943
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:35,610
All you've got to do
is tell us where he is.

944
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:40,519
Well, to the best of my information
and belief, Mr. Poole is in...

945
01:12:40,589 --> 01:12:42,352
- Venice.
- Venice?

946
01:12:42,424 --> 01:12:44,483
That's in Italy.

947
01:12:50,065 --> 01:12:51,532
Come in.

948
01:12:56,305 --> 01:12:59,138
- Here's your laundry.
- Thanks.

949
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:02,076
What's that?

950
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:04,840
That's a map
of New York City.

951
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:12,380
What are all those
little pins for?

952
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:16,324
Oh, that's a long story.

953
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:18,326
I've got plenty of time.

954
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:22,797
Well, each one of those little pins
represents a backyard.

955
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:27,234
I'm making sort of a tour
of all the backyards in New York City.

956
01:13:27,302 --> 01:13:30,897
- What for?
- I'm looking for somebody.

957
01:13:32,007 --> 01:13:33,975
- Are you a G-man?
- No.

958
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:38,809
- Who are you looking for?
- A girl.

959
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:43,181
- When you find her, what'll you do?
- Do you have to know?

960
01:13:45,554 --> 01:13:48,455
But I'd like to know.
You've got me all excited.

961
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:51,493
Listen, if I tell you,
will you keep it to yourself?

962
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,323
Oh, sure.

963
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:55,829
If I find that girl,
I'm going to get down on my knees...

964
01:13:55,898 --> 01:13:57,991
and apologize to her
for being such a fool...

965
01:13:58,066 --> 01:14:00,159
as to misunderstand her
for even a moment.

966
01:14:00,235 --> 01:14:04,035
I'm going to ask her
to forgive me.

967
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:08,008
If you'll excuse me, I've got
a lot of backyards to cover today.

968
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:20,612
<i>The breeze runs after you</i>

969
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:24,785
<i>When you're passing by</i>

970
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:28,819
<i>It wants to be near</i>

971
01:14:28,897 --> 01:14:33,027
<i>And so do I

972
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:37,435
<i>The willow bows to you</i>

973
01:14:37,506 --> 01:14:41,442
<i>Forgetting to cry</i>

974
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:45,139
<i>It waits for your smile</i>

975
01:14:45,214 --> 01:14:49,412
<i>And so do I

976
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:53,353
<i>All the world's at your command</i>

977
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:56,323
<i>What wouldn't it do</i>

978
01:14:56,391 --> 01:15:00,054
<i>For one look at you</i>

979
01:15:00,128 --> 01:15:03,154
<i>And I'm</i>

980
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:07,066
<i>That way too</i>

981
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:13,040
<i>The rose that you caress</i>

982
01:15:13,108 --> 01:15:18,068
<i>Is willing to die</i>

983
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:23,778
<i>It loves you so very much</i>

984
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:29,381
<i>And so</i>

985
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:33,895
<i>Do I

986
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:58,709
Oh, am I glad I found you.

987
01:15:58,787 --> 01:16:01,347
- You know I was down to my last pin?
- What pin?

988
01:16:01,423 --> 01:16:03,755
Wait till I get my breath.

989
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:08,855
Well, go ahead.
Slap my face. It was worth it.

990
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:10,558
Oh, don't be silly.

991
01:16:10,632 --> 01:16:13,829
- I've been looking all over for you.
- You've been looking for me?

992
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:15,597
Gee, I've been
looking for you for weeks.

993
01:16:15,671 --> 01:16:18,697
Why, I even put an ad
in the personal column.

994
01:16:18,774 --> 01:16:21,607
Larry, you shouldn't be here.
The police are looking for you.

995
01:16:21,677 --> 01:16:25,078
- You've got to leave town.
- Leave town is right.

996
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:28,016
I'm not going to eat!
I'm on a hunger strike!

997
01:16:28,016 --> 01:16:30,450
I'm not going to eat!
I'm on a hunger strike!

998
01:16:30,519 --> 01:16:34,011
I've lost three pounds in the last
two days, and I'll be dead soon!

999
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:36,853
She's perfectly capable
of carrying out her threats.

1000
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:39,359
Mr. Carmichael, I've got
my own health to consider.

1001
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:42,454
I'm on the verge
of a nervous breakdown.

1002
01:16:49,137 --> 01:16:50,729
So they found you, Poole.

1003
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:54,435
Yeah, I decided to come on back
and take my medicine.

1004
01:16:54,509 --> 01:16:56,409
Patricia, come back here.

1005
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:59,276
- No.
- See? That's what I get all the time.

1006
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:01,873
Now, I want this matter
settled here and now.

1007
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:04,544
You've got to take this demon
out of my institution.

1008
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:08,249
She's disrupted the discipline,
tried to set fire to the place...

1009
01:17:08,323 --> 01:17:10,791
smashed the furniture,
broken the windows...

1010
01:17:10,859 --> 01:17:12,850
and now it's a hunger strike.

1011
01:17:12,928 --> 01:17:15,624
And if I don't die of hunger,
I'm gonna jump out of the window.

1012
01:17:15,697 --> 01:17:18,131
I've written a letter
blaming everything on you...

1013
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:22,159
and I'm going to mail it to
all the newspapers before I kill myself!

1014
01:17:22,237 --> 01:17:25,934
You see! You've got
to do something about this...

1015
01:17:26,008 --> 01:17:28,442
even if you have to
adopt her yourself.

1016
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:32,776
Me? I'd rather resign my job.
Young man...

1017
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:35,544
you said you were ready
to take your medicine.

1018
01:17:35,617 --> 01:17:38,609
It may prove to be bitter medicine,
but you've got to help me out.

1019
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:41,781
- Help you out?
- Yes, with this brat.

1020
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:44,724
We've had nothing but trouble
ever since we sent her to the orphanage.

1021
01:17:44,793 --> 01:17:49,355
Shortly after she came there, carnival
people put on a show for the children.

1022
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:52,366
She tore open the bass drum
and tried to escape in it.

1023
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:55,733
Since then, she's made life
miserable for everybody.

1024
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:59,331
She refuses to go
with anybody but you.

1025
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:04,141
- Couldn't you take her off our hands?
- Well... Huh?

1026
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:06,510
You mean to say that's why
you had those cops bring me here?

1027
01:18:06,581 --> 01:18:09,812
I'm terribly sorry, but you see
the desperate situation I'm in.

1028
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:11,944
You're the only one
in the world who can help.

1029
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,648
And there was no other way
of finding you.

1030
01:18:14,723 --> 01:18:17,487
Well, I guess you boys know
the penalties for false arrest.

1031
01:18:17,559 --> 01:18:19,424
Who said you were
under arrest?

1032
01:18:19,494 --> 01:18:22,486
We were told to find you
and bring you here, and we did it.

1033
01:18:22,564 --> 01:18:25,829
First, you do everything to put this
child in an orphanage, and I'm the goat.

1034
01:18:25,901 --> 01:18:27,869
Now you're doing everything
under the sun to have her...

1035
01:18:27,936 --> 01:18:30,029
taken out of the orphanage,
and I'm still the goat.

1036
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:33,905
Looks to me like I'm "Joe Goat" around
here. Why should I do anything for you?

1037
01:18:33,975 --> 01:18:38,207
It isn't for me. I'm only acting
in the best interest of Patricia here...

1038
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,771
this poor little motherless child.

1039
01:18:42,084 --> 01:18:44,143
Well, Susan,
what do you think?

1040
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:46,949
First of all, I think
Mr. Carmichael owes you an apology.

1041
01:18:47,022 --> 01:18:50,219
I do, and I apologize
most humbly.

1042
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:53,227
- And you owe Miss Sprague an apology.
- I do.

1043
01:18:53,295 --> 01:18:55,229
- Hey, what about me?
- Shut up!

1044
01:18:55,297 --> 01:18:58,858
And then I think Patsy should be adopted
by a respectable married couple.

1045
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:02,802
Well, what's the matter with us?
Aren't we respectable?

1046
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:07,638
Yeah, what's the matter with them?
Oh, let's eat. I'm just dying of hunger.

1047
01:19:07,709 --> 01:19:10,109
Say good-bye to the nice man.

1048
01:19:10,178 --> 01:19:12,305
G... Oh. No, never mind.

1049
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:52,646
<i>When I'm waitin'for you</i>

1050
01:19:52,721 --> 01:19:55,349
<i>Three, four</i>
<i>Open up the door</i>

1051
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:58,756
<i>Now hurry, dear</i>
<i>Hurry, for heaven's sake</i>

1052
01:19:58,827 --> 01:20:03,264
<i>I count each step you take</i>
<i>when I'm waiting for you</i>

1053
01:20:06,034 --> 01:20:10,471
<i>Five, six, now my heart does tricks</i>
<i>as I picture all your charms</i>

1054
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:12,803
<i>Seven, eight</i>
<i>You're at the gate</i>

1055
01:20:12,874 --> 01:20:16,332
<i>And you make me dizzy</i>
<i>when you're walking right into my arms</i>

1056
01:20:16,411 --> 01:20:19,312
<i>Nine, ten, kiss me again</i>

1057
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:22,009
<i>Tell me you get such a thrill</i>

1058
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:24,449
<i>Just as I hope you will</i>

1059
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:26,817
<i>When I'm waiting for you</i>

1060
01:20:28,356 --> 01:20:29,948
Hey, hey, hey!
Look out there!

1061
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:33,722
Hey, hey!
Look out! Look out!
