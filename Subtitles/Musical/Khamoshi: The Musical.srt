1
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:23,039
Papa, can you hear me?

2
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:29,809
... but what is life
without an impossible dream!

3
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,840
Joseph, you look very happy today

4
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,790
Your daughter is coming?

5
00:01:31,989 --> 00:01:33,769
Son-in-law too!

6
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,519
lt's good. Very good

7
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:21,560
SILENCE an album by...

8
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:25,090
Annie and Raj

9
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,449
Forget it, man

10
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,680
Just let it go

11
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,490
Annie...car...an accident!

12
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:31,199
Can't say anything for 24 hours

13
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:35,170
But there is hope if she comes to
in the meantime

14
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:37,870
She will be kept under observation

15
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:42,199
Sister, have one more
Nexamethazone injection ready

16
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,569
Today while death is so close...

17
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,049
l can see through my whole life

18
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,570
An absolute and rich life...

19
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:36,500
which we all lived

20
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:39,049
Always lived together...

21
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:42,179
through thick and thin

22
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:44,980
Joseph! Joseph!

23
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:49,009
God has blessed you with a baby girl!

24
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:51,240
And there begins...

25
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,250
An incredible dream...

26
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:58,320
lf my papa could call me by my name once

27
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:03,240
l saw this dream the day l was born

28
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:06,110
But life is meaningless...

29
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:09,169
without an incredible dream

30
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,159
Joseph!

31
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:04,269
Yes, my son! She can hear

32
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,629
She can hear!

33
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:14,259
There is rhythm in her voice!

34
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,250
This house has got voice
after so many years

35
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,399
After many years!

36
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:22,509
My sweet child!

37
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,029
My birth brought new beginning of voice
in my parent's life

38
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,889
ln their silent life...

39
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:06,519
even the sound of my cries was
a source of joy for them

40
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:11,129
Mariam used to say that...

41
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,529
At the time of my birth
l cried in rhythm of shells

42
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,149
So l was christened Annie

43
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,039
Annie Joseph Bergenza

44
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,409
Our house was full of silence
as well as sounds

45
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:29,240
Mariam introduced me
the rhythm hidden in it

46
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,879
Noise of waves

47
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,889
No...the rhythm

48
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,549
Since childhood my life had divided
in two different worlds

49
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:43,710
On one side there was the silence
of my parent's life...

50
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:46,519
And on the other side there was
Mariam's music

51
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:55,200
Did you sell the soap?

52
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:00,339
Don't worry. We stole two fish

53
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,490
For eating

54
00:18:07,579 --> 00:18:11,059
Me and Annie

55
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,099
Stealing? This is not stealing

56
00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:29,630
Everybody does it in childhood
It's just a play

57
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,890
This is not stealing
Fishermen also steal it from the river

58
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:51,630
ls it wrong? Then what is right?

59
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,859
ls it right if children sleep hungry?

60
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:04,140
No! Papa! Please!

61
00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:05,970
What are you doing?

62
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,230
Listen to me!

63
00:19:08,609 --> 00:19:10,599
No, Papa! No!

64
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:18,569
You couldn't sell soap so you're
taking it out on children

65
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,009
Damn the people

66
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:28,730
Do people feed your hungry children?

67
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,329
You have not been disgraced

68
00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:38,380
One day your daughter will become
your voice

69
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,549
Remember this!

70
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:46,589
l am the wife of a freedom fighter

71
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:51,210
What did we get after independence?
Only this house

72
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:56,849
But they didn't realise
we needed food also

73
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:04,440
Your father didn't give his life
for the sake of truth

74
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,480
He gave up his life because
he couldn't face the truth

75
00:20:09,569 --> 00:20:10,619
What's the truth?

76
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,839
The truth is that he died because of you

77
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:19,009
You are deaf and dumb
He couldn't stand the truth

78
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,029
So he died there

79
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,019
Did you hear me?

80
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:26,200
Did you!

81
00:20:51,849 --> 00:20:54,750
We are from Super clean factory
It's new product of our factory

82
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,809
Three rupees for one piece
Two pieces for five

83
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,140
lt's gentle to your hands too

84
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:30,190
We are from Super clean factory

85
00:21:30,579 --> 00:21:32,279
This is a new product of our factory

86
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:33,799
You...

87
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:43,019
We are from Super clean factory
It's a new product

88
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:46,630
Please give us one more chance
Two for three rupees, one for five

89
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:51,130
Wrong! One for 3, 2 for five

90
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:53,210
Correct?

91
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:07,549
We are from Super clean factory

92
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,579
This soap will be kind to your hands too
along with your clothes

93
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,859
Please give one more chance

94
00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:15,069
lf you use it once, you'll want
to buy it again and again

95
00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:18,079
One for three, two for five

96
00:22:40,089 --> 00:22:42,779
Only three packets!

97
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:46,490
You sold only three packets in ten days?

98
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:50,079
Enough! No more business with you

99
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,039
You are fired

100
00:22:55,569 --> 00:22:59,519
We do work hard but
people don't understand

101
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,990
Give us one more chance

102
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,250
You are not worth a second chance

103
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,079
You've always been fired
from every employment

104
00:23:07,579 --> 00:23:09,769
The only alternative left for you
is begging

105
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,559
Hey, girlie! Tell him

106
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:15,809
l pitied you because you were deaf

107
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:18,750
You take this little girl with you
on work

108
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:20,779
You don't understand what she says

109
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,740
Neither can you explain anything
to people, and you want another chance!

110
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:26,190
He has got no choice but begging

111
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,799
Take this money as alms
and get out of here

112
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:32,140
l don't want to see your faces again

113
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:38,650
Help me!

114
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:41,220
Papa, please don't do it!

115
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:50,150
l took sympathy for this mute
and now he is beating me!

116
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,259
The deaf is beating me!

117
00:23:56,859 --> 00:23:59,789
Let him go, guys
He can do nothing to me!

118
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,140
l took pity on this bloody deaf!

119
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:05,359
No, Papa, please don't

120
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:08,740
Someone please help me,
he's going to kill me

121
00:24:12,579 --> 00:24:15,569
Suddenly l felt grown up
to see my father's helplessness

122
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:21,069
l began to understand why l
couldn't steal fish even for a game

123
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,059
We are different

124
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,480
People don't understand us

125
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,299
No! Mom, No!

126
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,920
Please, No!

127
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:34,759
Mama, please don't kill it! Please!

128
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:52,470
Eventually the music vanished
from our life...

129
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,559
and silence was everywhere

130
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:04,759
Papa was jobless and we parted away
from our dear things

131
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,950
Come on!

132
00:26:07,329 --> 00:26:08,529
Be careful

133
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:09,789
This side please

134
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:12,500
Please keep it straight

135
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:16,380
Watch it, man! It's very delicate

136
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,019
l watched my piano being taken away

137
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,549
l was parting from a dear friend

138
00:26:22,009 --> 00:26:26,960
l felt as if it was urging me to stop it
It wanted to be with me

139
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,910
Don't cry, my child

140
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:35,859
What parts away comes back
sooner or later

141
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:39,039
Remember this

142
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:46,440
Listen! Music is alive
as long as our heart goes on ticking

143
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:51,460
Now everybody will sing...

144
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:54,589
...with our piano, right?

145
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,819
Mariam passed away

146
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:11,079
but her memories were always with me

147
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:15,089
l can still hear her songs

148
00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:19,720
Her song's became my strength

149
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:23,380
lt was my guiding light
throughout my life

150
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,819
lt guided me in difficult times

151
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:30,799
Thank you

152
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,250
Thank you, Mother Mariam

153
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:50,430
Come on, children

154
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:53,130
Willy became our friend

155
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,759
Because of him there was piano
in our life once again

156
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,539
Happiness was returning in our life

157
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:02,390
You see, this is how it is played

158
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:06,079
Papa was working in a toy factory,

159
00:34:06,509 --> 00:34:10,260
where even an ordinary pipe seemed
a bugle to us children

160
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,179
You scared me!

161
00:35:11,969 --> 00:35:15,539
Now this box will sing

162
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:18,920
l don't believe this box can sing

163
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:20,639
By God it can!

164
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,380
You are joking, right?

165
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,829
You don't believe too?      No!

166
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:24,730
Why?

167
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,590
Mummy says never listen to people
who can hear and speak

168
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:32,099
Ain't l your friend, Willy?
l never tell lies

169
00:35:33,059 --> 00:35:36,309
Just a minute. Put it here like this

170
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,739
And here it goes

171
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:49,519
Really! It is indeed singing

172
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:58,610
What if we fix it
in our parent's throats?

173
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,949
Will they be able to speak?

174
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,659
No. It cannot be fixed
in any body's throat

175
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:06,500
lt can sing other's voices

176
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:11,110
One day it will sing our Annie's songs

177
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:18,909
Remember this!
It is going to happen one day

178
00:37:09,889 --> 00:37:12,880
Sam! Sam!

179
00:37:14,389 --> 00:37:17,000
Mom is calling for prayer

180
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,130
l won't come. You go!

181
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,960
Come down!

182
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,469
Sam!

183
00:37:35,179 --> 00:37:36,320
Sam!

184
00:37:41,389 --> 00:37:43,500
Mom! Papa!

185
00:37:43,989 --> 00:37:46,070
Mummy, Papa

186
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,929
Papa, papa

187
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,110
Sam, Sam!

188
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:57,019
Come on, hurry up

189
00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:07,920
That day...

190
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,320
l heard papa's silent cries
for the first time in my life

191
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,650
l never forgot those cries

192
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:17,920
The cries of helplessness

193
00:40:18,409 --> 00:40:20,900
And anger towards God

194
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:24,659
There was sadness in our house
after this incident

195
00:40:25,179 --> 00:40:26,909
l was lonely

196
00:40:30,789 --> 00:40:32,900
Mummy and Papa kicked God
out of their life

197
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,260
They had only one hope,

198
00:40:36,829 --> 00:40:38,059
Only one truth

199
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:40,440
And that was me!

200
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:47,199
They lost faith in God

201
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:52,800
But l was sure God would come back
in our house

202
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:05,789
PLEASE SING NO SAD SONG FOR ME

203
00:45:52,139 --> 00:45:53,690
Thank you

204
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:57,159
Thank you

205
00:46:54,139 --> 00:46:55,750
Uh, no! Please stay still

206
00:46:56,139 --> 00:46:59,210
lf you leave,
my music will be incomplete

207
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,269
Thank you. Just for a few minutes

208
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:10,420
lt's over

209
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,010
Would you like to hear my music?

210
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:47,630
Just think

211
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,119
A beautiful girl
went in a light house...

212
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:54,159
with this tune on her lips

213
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,539
Her voice was full of magic

214
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:00,920
People used to come to hear her voice
from far off places

215
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:06,340
And her voice became popular
in the whole world

216
00:48:07,909 --> 00:48:09,429
The flute comes at this note

217
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:13,530
Flowers would blossom at her voice

218
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:15,639
Even the impossible
would become possible

219
00:48:16,019 --> 00:48:18,889
lt would seem like
all the seasons had joined hands

220
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:25,269
And her voice reached such heights...

221
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,159
that no one could ever imagine

222
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,719
The whole world sang with her

223
00:48:35,469 --> 00:48:38,079
When she would sing,
everything else would stop

224
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:40,860
lt would take people's sorrows away

225
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:46,320
The whole world was mesmerised

226
00:48:47,849 --> 00:48:51,190
And then suddenly...she stopped singing

227
00:48:53,289 --> 00:48:56,690
Why? No one knows

228
00:48:58,659 --> 00:49:02,260
There was no answer
to people's questions

229
00:49:03,369 --> 00:49:06,829
Something will be always be amiss
in my life till l get back that voice

230
00:49:07,469 --> 00:49:10,019
So tell me, what do you think
about this tune?

231
00:49:10,539 --> 00:49:11,619
Like it?

232
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:13,550
Thank you

233
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,829
Hang on...thank you

234
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:29,400
See! Mariam also wants you to stay here

235
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:31,449
Weather is so pleasant

236
00:49:31,829 --> 00:49:33,469
l can do anything in such weather

237
00:49:33,869 --> 00:49:36,360
For example, l can guess your name

238
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:39,570
Auntie Sophia... No?

239
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,179
Khatima... No?

240
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:43,289
Usha Dai... No?

241
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,690
Then?     Annie

242
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:47,480
Annie!

243
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:52,769
Annie...You look very beautiful
when you laugh

244
00:49:53,889 --> 00:49:55,349
You look very ugly

245
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,699
Thank you very much, Mother Mariam

246
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:38,420
A nice tune indeed
Where did you hear it?

247
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:40,579
lt's the voice of my heart

248
00:50:40,969 --> 00:50:43,690
l've composed it for a very pretty girl

249
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:46,059
Oh, l see!

250
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:49,519
Willy?      Yes

251
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,079
You can sell this piano now

252
00:50:51,409 --> 00:50:53,219
No, my son

253
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,829
l will not sell this piano

254
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,780
Tell me some thing

255
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:05,170
lf this piano were very dear to you,
a memento of somebody's love...

256
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:08,800
Would you have sold it?

257
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:11,199
God bless you

258
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,449
There you are!

259
00:51:46,329 --> 00:51:49,050
You always leave your shop unattended

260
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:54,320
Accounts are ready
There were so many mistakes

261
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:56,429
Mistakes can be corrected

262
00:51:56,809 --> 00:51:58,179
You go now. l will come soon

263
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:00,210
Don't take too long

264
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:02,039
Yeah, yeah, l am coming

265
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:09,219
What's this, Willy Uncle
You've even left the piano open!

266
00:53:00,309 --> 00:53:01,769
You know what...

267
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:06,050
Your voice is more beautiful than you

268
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:10,929
You must be wondering as to why l'm here

269
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,789
l came to buy this piano

270
00:53:14,219 --> 00:53:18,730
But now l know, this piano is
very dear to somebody

271
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:29,449
Now you must be thinking about
the goings-on of my mind

272
00:53:30,539 --> 00:53:34,139
l'm thinking that how will l be able
to go away...

273
00:53:35,869 --> 00:53:38,650
after being so close to you

274
00:53:40,949 --> 00:53:43,059
Today l am very happy

275
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:46,539
Because l have heard your voice

276
00:53:51,289 --> 00:53:56,829
l have found the voice
l have been looking for

277
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:09,369
You still have this with you?

278
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:21,000
Uncle Willy has still been keeping
this safely

279
00:54:21,489 --> 00:54:25,940
You remember Sam and l used to hear it?
And how we used to dance!

280
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:38,170
Papa, shall we dance?

281
00:54:40,409 --> 00:54:42,659
Please, Papa. Just once

282
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:44,969
Yeah!

283
00:54:57,590 --> 00:55:00,460
One, two, three and...turn

284
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:15,610
Mummy, do join us

285
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:17,239
Mummy

286
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:21,190
Mummy! Stop

287
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:27,019
Mummy's sewing machine
is making too much noise

288
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:38,380
Papa! Just a minute

289
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:42,710
Mummy! Mummy

290
00:55:44,199 --> 00:55:46,309
Please stop it for a while, the music...

291
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,349
Mama, look at me

292
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,449
Can't you stop it for a while?

293
00:55:53,449 --> 00:55:54,469
But why?

294
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:56,179
Why can't you stop it?

295
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,659
ls it very urgent?

296
00:55:59,219 --> 00:56:01,409
What difference would it make
if you were to stop this for a while?

297
00:56:01,889 --> 00:56:02,880
Mummy!

298
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,360
But why? Why do you hate music so?

299
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,219
Why doesn't Mama listen...

300
00:56:51,239 --> 00:56:53,409
Father, l have a confession to make

301
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:55,869
Speak, my child

302
00:56:56,710 --> 00:57:00,429
For the first time in my life,
l yelled at my parents

303
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:03,329
l love them too much

304
00:57:06,019 --> 00:57:09,150
l didn't even think once
what would happen to them

305
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:12,679
They have nobody except me

306
00:57:13,659 --> 00:57:15,739
And l know this very well

307
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:19,570
lf you feel sorry,
God will definitely forgive you

308
00:57:20,199 --> 00:57:22,159
Father, l'm very afraid

309
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,460
l feel that there is a
whole new world out there beckoning me,

310
00:57:25,969 --> 00:57:30,920
lf l step into it,
l will be away from my parents

311
00:57:32,409 --> 00:57:34,280
That world is full of happiness

312
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:38,110
But l don't want such happiness
which l can't share with my parents

313
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:42,239
Whenever l hear the sound of waves...

314
00:57:43,349 --> 00:57:45,960
l hear music, l hear a song...

315
00:57:46,619 --> 00:57:48,429
Whispering of leaves

316
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:52,079
l feel like l am committing a sin

317
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:55,769
Annie, l cannot understand your sin

318
00:57:56,469 --> 00:57:59,750
Music is a God given gift
It's not a sin

319
00:58:00,369 --> 00:58:03,849
Whatever you want to confess,
say it frankly

320
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,630
Father, these days l am being attracted
towards somebody

321
00:58:09,179 --> 00:58:11,639
So, this is the problem!

322
00:58:12,619 --> 00:58:15,170
Who is this boy? Is he from our village?

323
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:18,030
No, he is an outsider

324
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:20,110
What is his name?

325
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:21,579
l don't know

326
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:24,340
You don't know even his name
and you're getting so upset!

327
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,110
Father, actually l...

328
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:27,579
Just a moment

329
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,340
Father, l have to speak to you

330
00:58:31,699 --> 00:58:33,719
Wait for some time
a confession is in progress

331
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:36,570
There seem to be more sinners
than priests, l guess

332
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:37,949
Am l right?       Right

333
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:40,409
Good. So, some sinners must wait. Right?

334
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,579
Right again. Me a sinner!

335
00:58:44,949 --> 00:58:46,059
Sorry, my child

336
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:50,059
Ok, tell me where did you meet this guy

337
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:51,780
ln the cemetery

338
00:58:52,119 --> 00:58:52,940
Cemetery?!

339
00:58:53,219 --> 00:58:55,739
lf it would have been a funeral
then l must have been present there

340
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:58,400
No. l just went there...

341
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,579
Without any reason, to the graveyard?
And then?

342
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,539
Then he met me in Willy's shop

343
00:59:05,269 --> 00:59:08,260
l just happen to meet him so suddenly
every time. Just like that!

344
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,619
lt seems as if he is present here too,
somewhere

345
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:11,940
Just a minute

346
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:15,900
Sorry for the disturbance

347
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:17,409
Can't you wait even for a while?

348
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:20,150
Have you heard about something
called patience?

349
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:21,260
No

350
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:23,420
No? Anyway, tell me
what do you have to say

351
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:24,650
l have to confess something

352
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,449
l know. You didn't obviously come here
for a cup of tea!

353
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:28,750
No?

354
00:59:29,329 --> 00:59:30,730
You are here to confess a sin
No

355
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:31,949
No?

356
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:33,809
l came to confess my love

357
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:38,179
Father, how can meeting a lovely girl
be termed as a Sin?

358
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,480
And that too, in the graveyard

359
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:41,690
ln the graveyard?

360
00:59:41,969 --> 00:59:45,159
According to me it would have been
by the grace of God

361
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:48,010
She happens to meet me suddenly
Everywhere

362
00:59:48,449 --> 00:59:49,619
All of a sudden, anywhere!

363
00:59:49,949 --> 00:59:53,960
Yes, when l lift up my eyes,
l find her there

364
00:59:54,949 --> 00:59:58,670
On the way when l turn back,
l find her in front of me

365
00:59:59,659 --> 01:00:02,119
When l see her
l wish her scarf to fly away

366
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:03,650
lt does fly

367
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,920
Right. l go in a shop and find her
playing my tune on the piano

368
01:00:09,769 --> 01:00:10,880
ln Willy's shop

369
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:12,719
Right, Father

370
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:15,349
lt's truly a miracle

371
01:00:15,769 --> 01:00:17,380
Of course, It is

372
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:19,239
When did you meet her?

373
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:21,090
Three days ago

374
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:22,840
Since then l have been very excited

375
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:25,320
l know nothing about him

376
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:27,969
Except that he composes music

377
01:00:28,489 --> 01:00:29,510
l know nothing about her

378
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:30,670
Except her name

379
01:00:30,989 --> 01:00:31,449
Annie

380
01:00:31,719 --> 01:00:32,679
What! Do you know her?

381
01:00:33,019 --> 01:00:34,360
Oh Father, you are not father,
you are a grandfather!

382
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,630
l must touch your feet
Go back in the confession stand

383
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:38,650
Sorry,  l got a little excited

384
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:40,730
Love doesn't mean
that you've to be desperate

385
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:42,710
lt's not meant for only enjoyment,
it's not a sin either

386
01:00:43,099 --> 01:00:45,500
lt is an enduring sorrow, and patience

387
01:00:46,239 --> 01:00:48,460
Can you do it for our Annie

388
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:51,130
Father, l love Annie immensely

389
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:53,710
l can do anything for her

390
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:55,659
Good. She is here

391
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:57,559
This thing did cross my mind

392
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,909
Go and express your love

393
01:04:45,909 --> 01:04:47,579
l am mad at you

394
01:04:49,079 --> 01:04:51,039
Why didn't you tell me...

395
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:54,010
that you had been promoted?

396
01:04:56,849 --> 01:05:00,800
Even then...at least you should have
told me and Mummy

397
01:05:08,769 --> 01:05:10,380
Sun?

398
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,139
lt gives light to whole universe

399
01:05:15,269 --> 01:05:17,110
And yet speaks nothing

400
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:23,440
Papa, l am very happy

401
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:26,550
l am proud of you

402
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,730
How do you feel?

403
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,780
Papa, we ought to celebrate

404
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:38,400
We will indeed

405
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:49,300
We will buy a car later, first of all
l want a red dress with frills

406
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:52,050
Papa, listen to me

407
01:05:52,739 --> 01:05:54,670
l need a new dress

408
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:57,989
l want to look beautiful
in the coming carnival. Papa, please

409
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,659
You've always worn clothes sewn by mom

410
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,820
But l won't let it happen to me
Mom will listen to me

411
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,280
First l will talk about promotion

412
01:06:13,659 --> 01:06:14,650
Mom will be very happy

413
01:06:14,969 --> 01:06:17,159
Then, l will tell her
about the new dress

414
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:20,289
lt's a bet

415
01:06:22,769 --> 01:06:25,929
lf l lose, you give me nine punches

416
01:06:26,739 --> 01:06:30,079
Alright, but if l win
l will give you nine

417
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:37,300
Today, l scolded Papa
He didn't tell us about his promotion

418
01:06:38,059 --> 01:06:39,579
We will celebrate

419
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,789
Papa promised me a new dress...

420
01:06:48,829 --> 01:06:51,199
Mom has already had it ready

421
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:25,829
So pretty!

422
01:08:15,449 --> 01:08:16,819
Shall we go up?

423
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,600
What is it?      l am scared

424
01:08:20,989 --> 01:08:23,390
Hold my hand, then you won't
Shall we go?

425
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,520
Now what?

426
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,899
Do you trust me?

427
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,539
Then close your eyes

428
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,359
Come on, now

429
01:08:51,189 --> 01:08:53,739
You trust me so much

430
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:55,930
And you don't even know my name!

431
01:08:56,329 --> 01:08:57,939
l know       Really, what is it?

432
01:08:58,329 --> 01:08:59,229
Raj

433
01:09:00,729 --> 01:09:03,250
ln my childhood, Mariam used to speak
about this prince

434
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:07,550
He would come in a plane
and take me somewhere

435
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:10,289
ln the world of magic

436
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:12,279
ln the world of music

437
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:14,909
Where there will be no darkness

438
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:17,220
Only happiness and joy

439
01:09:17,649 --> 01:09:18,699
Did you say something?

440
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:20,949
No. Nothing at all

441
01:09:48,010 --> 01:09:50,640
Do you know why did l bring you here?

442
01:09:53,479 --> 01:09:55,850
Don't you know why l brought you here?

443
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:59,770
Nobody can see us here,
no one can hear us

444
01:10:01,229 --> 01:10:04,329
No one can hear, no one can see

445
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,550
Come closer

446
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:10,779
Come close to me, Annie

447
01:10:13,069 --> 01:10:14,500
And say

448
01:10:14,869 --> 01:10:17,239
Say what?

449
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:21,270
l've brought you here so that...

450
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:25,789
so that you can say, ''l love you''

451
01:10:28,189 --> 01:10:29,710
You were scared, right?

452
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:33,390
Please say it

453
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:35,920
Say it

454
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:38,800
Oh, come on

455
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:43,340
Say it

456
01:10:45,970 --> 01:10:47,779
Say that you love me

457
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,329
Okay,  Say,  ''l''...

458
01:10:53,579 --> 01:10:54,369
l.  .  .

459
01:10:54,810 --> 01:10:56,449
''Love''...

460
01:11:02,319 --> 01:11:05,100
Okay say, ''l hate you''

461
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:09,050
l hate you

462
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:10,359
Again

463
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:12,869
l hate you

464
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:13,989
Again

465
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,310
l hate you

466
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:18,689
Again

467
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:21,789
l hate you

468
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:23,189
Again

469
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:26,329
l love you

470
01:11:26,710 --> 01:11:27,640
Again

471
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:30,649
l Love you

472
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:32,159
All right

473
01:11:35,619 --> 01:11:37,789
l hate you too

474
01:12:09,149 --> 01:12:10,489
Freedom

475
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:11,930
Flight

476
01:12:12,819 --> 01:12:15,340
Eventually Papa bought
one second hand car

477
01:12:16,289 --> 01:12:18,130
The whole world became
a steering wheel for him

478
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,470
Which he could control as he liked

479
01:12:22,699 --> 01:12:24,479
Papa was as excited as a child

480
01:12:24,899 --> 01:12:27,039
Your dream has come true

481
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,199
To own a car

482
01:12:30,869 --> 01:12:32,510
Today my dream will come true

483
01:12:32,909 --> 01:12:35,810
Annie will sing. Yes, she will sing

484
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:45,779
Papa, he wants me to sing

485
01:12:46,359 --> 01:12:49,869
l don't know, l haven't decided yet

486
01:12:50,729 --> 01:12:52,869
Hey, listen! Let me explain

487
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:55,939
Raj heard Annie's voice
He liked it very much

488
01:12:56,470 --> 01:12:58,369
Raj wants to record Annie's voice

489
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,699
l will explain you everything later

490
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:02,510
Let's go

491
01:13:05,609 --> 01:13:07,310
l told you not to buy this junk

492
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:10,430
Now l have to push it to start

493
01:13:16,189 --> 01:13:18,800
Didn't you tell them about Raj?

494
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:20,819
l did not get a chance

495
01:13:21,229 --> 01:13:23,779
Chance...you ain't going to get one
without going for it

496
01:13:24,289 --> 01:13:26,039
Raj is an outsider

497
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:30,569
He doesn't even know
l live in a different world

498
01:13:31,439 --> 01:13:34,399
l don't know whether my parents will
approve of him

499
01:13:34,970 --> 01:13:36,260
lt's not about Raj...

500
01:13:36,609 --> 01:13:40,890
They won't let any boy come in your life

501
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:44,729
They have to live their life
on their own without you

502
01:13:45,279 --> 01:13:47,329
You have to explain it to them

503
01:13:47,789 --> 01:13:50,399
l cannot do that

504
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:52,029
What?

505
01:13:52,590 --> 01:13:54,399
Are you going to look after them
your entire life?

506
01:13:54,859 --> 01:13:57,109
Can you live without Raj?

507
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:02,539
My normal life was slipping away...

508
01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:07,500
And Raj was attracting me
in his own world

509
01:14:08,909 --> 01:14:10,779
l lived in anticipated fear,

510
01:14:11,210 --> 01:14:14,810
whether these two different worlds
could become one!

511
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,649
Annie, welcome to the world of music

512
01:14:31,829 --> 01:14:35,750
l always wanted to bring you here

513
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,090
To this recording studio

514
01:14:40,699 --> 01:14:42,890
This is not only a recording studio...

515
01:14:43,369 --> 01:14:44,659
This is our church

516
01:14:45,579 --> 01:14:48,800
This is our world, our earth, our sky

517
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:52,840
Can you feel the silence?

518
01:14:54,119 --> 01:14:57,140
This silence is full of music

519
01:14:58,090 --> 01:14:59,930
The history of music

520
01:15:00,859 --> 01:15:04,020
l get overwhelmed whenever l come here

521
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:10,890
Since childhood l always wanted
just one thing

522
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:13,810
Music

523
01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:17,140
Only music

524
01:15:18,579 --> 01:15:20,329
Listen carefully

525
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:24,560
You feel as if you hear old songs here

526
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:28,409
The voices of great artistes

527
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:32,359
What do you hear?

528
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:36,609
l hear Mariam's voice

529
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:40,649
l hear her songs

530
01:15:42,399 --> 01:15:44,920
The buoyant laughter of Sam

531
01:15:46,369 --> 01:15:48,510
That childhood rain

532
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,779
Those dreams

533
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:55,479
Your dreams will come true

534
01:15:56,579 --> 01:15:58,569
We will work hard towards them

535
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:00,130
And then one day...

536
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:02,829
You will be standing
in front of the microphone

537
01:16:03,289 --> 01:16:04,600
And...

538
01:16:06,289 --> 01:16:09,600
Drums over here. Saxophones over there

539
01:16:11,229 --> 01:16:14,449
Flutes, violins, trumpets,

540
01:16:15,069 --> 01:16:16,090
guitars

541
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:20,699
Annie, you will be surrounded by music

542
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:22,770
And everything will be silent

543
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:27,590
And your voice accompanied by
a perfect rhythm,

544
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:30,010
will reach Mariam

545
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:37,359
And the whole world will sing with you

546
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:49,659
Mama!

547
01:18:55,859 --> 01:18:57,699
Papa?

548
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,260
Can't you hear?

549
01:19:03,770 --> 01:19:06,989
Look over there. Mom needs help

550
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,729
l am sorry, Papa

551
01:19:54,850 --> 01:19:57,810
l shouldn't have shouted at you

552
01:19:58,989 --> 01:20:02,149
For a moment l forgot
that you couldn't hear

553
01:20:02,789 --> 01:20:04,130
l am sorry

554
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:17,890
Nothing will happen. l am with you

555
01:20:19,010 --> 01:20:22,350
l will never leave you alone now

556
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,079
Never

557
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:54,970
After mom's heart attack, l realised...

558
01:20:55,979 --> 01:21:00,260
l had to be there for my parents

559
01:21:02,050 --> 01:21:05,479
Every time, every moment

560
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:10,350
l decided to break up with Raj

561
01:21:12,130 --> 01:21:15,409
But there remained many unsung songs,

562
01:21:16,029 --> 01:21:19,100
Many things which we wanted to share,
but couldn't!

563
01:21:19,699 --> 01:21:21,250
Annie?

564
01:21:23,470 --> 01:21:24,899
Annie

565
01:21:36,119 --> 01:21:38,699
Don't take that bus, l am coming

566
01:21:40,489 --> 01:21:42,630
After all, what is the matter?

567
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:17,500
Annie, l love you...

568
01:22:18,430 --> 01:22:20,359
and you love me too

569
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,079
Then what's wrong with you?

570
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:26,899
l waited for you at the rehearsal hall
but you didn't turn up

571
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:31,890
You saw me on the road
and just ignored me

572
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:34,579
Why all this?

573
01:22:36,010 --> 01:22:37,739
Why don't you speak?

574
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:39,750
You have to answer

575
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:42,899
l can't live without you

576
01:22:44,149 --> 01:22:46,989
Neither can you without me

577
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:52,890
Then what is it that is creating
the distance between us?

578
01:22:53,930 --> 01:22:56,590
Why don't you say something, Annie?

579
01:22:57,130 --> 01:22:58,560
Did the cat get your tongue?

580
01:22:58,939 --> 01:22:59,699
Are you a mute?

581
01:22:59,970 --> 01:23:01,579
Yes, l am indeed dumb

582
01:23:02,470 --> 01:23:04,340
lt's just between both of us

583
01:23:10,010 --> 01:23:11,739
Annie! Annie?

584
01:23:12,149 --> 01:23:13,880
Where are you taking me?

585
01:23:17,149 --> 01:23:19,810
Annie, what are you doing?
They will wake up

586
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:21,819
They won't

587
01:23:22,359 --> 01:23:25,229
Shout! Cry! No one will hear you

588
01:23:31,229 --> 01:23:33,510
My parents are mute

589
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:40,100
Had l not reached in time...

590
01:23:40,609 --> 01:23:43,100
anything could have happened to mom

591
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:48,270
l can't sing, Raj

592
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:54,600
l cannot sing!

593
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:10,460
Sorry, Annie

594
01:24:15,210 --> 01:24:19,310
Annie, l am not taking you away
from them

595
01:24:20,949 --> 01:24:24,460
Actually l want to give them
their son back

596
01:24:30,189 --> 01:24:34,970
And you will sing for them, not for me

597
01:24:37,229 --> 01:24:39,840
Because you are their voice

598
01:24:42,439 --> 01:24:44,779
They cannot hear you

599
01:24:46,739 --> 01:24:50,079
But would at least be able to feel it

600
01:24:54,149 --> 01:24:59,340
Even if you were like them...

601
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:06,569
l would have loved you

602
01:25:09,930 --> 01:25:12,390
Yes. Do you know why?

603
01:25:19,979 --> 01:25:22,170
Because l love you

604
01:25:28,550 --> 01:25:30,250
l love you

605
01:25:31,189 --> 01:25:34,699
Eh what! Just now you were asking me
to shout

606
01:25:46,270 --> 01:25:48,899
We waited till Mama was better

607
01:25:50,010 --> 01:25:53,029
Raj always used to dispel any fears
that l had

608
01:25:54,180 --> 01:25:55,670
l now wanted to sing,

609
01:25:56,050 --> 01:25:57,130
without any fear

610
01:25:57,710 --> 01:25:59,640
l wished to experience life with Raj

611
01:26:00,079 --> 01:26:01,449
without any burden on my heart

612
01:27:42,189 --> 01:27:43,770
Happy birthday, Papa

613
01:27:46,189 --> 01:27:49,149
Sorry, l got late at the rehearsal

614
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:52,939
Your favourite flower

615
01:28:06,079 --> 01:28:08,659
This isn't your favourite flower?

616
01:28:09,479 --> 01:28:11,380
Yes, your favourite is...

617
01:28:11,810 --> 01:28:13,010
lt's Mama

618
01:28:16,649 --> 01:28:18,199
My favourite?

619
01:28:19,359 --> 01:28:20,529
Not you?

620
01:28:25,090 --> 01:28:26,729
Music?

621
01:28:31,970 --> 01:28:35,130
No, Papa, you both are dear to me,
not the music

622
01:28:35,739 --> 01:28:39,109
Today l was late because
it was the last day of rehearsal

623
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:42,449
l rehearsed with a full orchestra

624
01:28:43,609 --> 01:28:46,710
There is a recording tomorrow
l'm very nervous

625
01:28:47,319 --> 01:28:49,489
You will have to accompany me

626
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:57,420
What is so funny?

627
01:29:00,729 --> 01:29:02,399
People?

628
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:05,689
They will laugh at you

629
01:29:06,970 --> 01:29:08,079
Why?

630
01:29:15,649 --> 01:29:18,020
Because you cannot hear,

631
01:29:19,949 --> 01:29:22,699
And are going for
your daughter's programme

632
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:28,810
Over there nobody knows you

633
01:29:31,430 --> 01:29:33,890
Papa, l don't feel at all ashamed of you

634
01:29:37,029 --> 01:29:37,960
No, nothing doing

635
01:29:38,270 --> 01:29:40,109
You will have to come with me

636
01:29:40,539 --> 01:29:42,350
Tomorrow is a very big day for me

637
01:29:42,970 --> 01:29:45,659
l will not sing if you won't come

638
01:29:46,210 --> 01:29:47,229
No!

639
01:29:56,289 --> 01:29:59,010
You hate music, right?

640
01:30:06,829 --> 01:30:09,289
So, you won't come

641
01:30:14,439 --> 01:30:17,869
Happy birthday to you

642
01:30:19,909 --> 01:30:24,069
Happy birthday to you

643
01:36:37,119 --> 01:36:39,670
You always say that my shop is crowded

644
01:36:40,220 --> 01:36:42,180
This is just one, but l've enough space
for ten christmas trees

645
01:36:42,659 --> 01:36:45,970
Jingle bells, Jingle bells,
jingle all the way

646
01:36:47,229 --> 01:36:48,250
Willy?

647
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:51,109
Where's the piano?

648
01:36:51,470 --> 01:36:52,989
l sold it.  l sold it,  my child

649
01:36:53,369 --> 01:36:55,619
Somebody offered a good price
l couldn't refuse

650
01:36:56,109 --> 01:36:59,039
For the first time in my life
l made so much profit

651
01:36:59,609 --> 01:37:02,539
lt looks so beautiful
in the piano's place

652
01:37:03,310 --> 01:37:07,090
We will decorate it. This is
the happiest christmas of my life

653
01:37:07,779 --> 01:37:09,859
Merry Christmas, Willy

654
01:37:53,260 --> 01:37:54,930
Mariam was right

655
01:37:55,329 --> 01:37:59,140
Whatever parts away,
comes back sooner or later

656
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:02,829
My piano also came back

657
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:12,590
Thank you, Papa

658
01:38:53,390 --> 01:38:55,819
Uncle Willy, You lied to me
You fooled me

659
01:38:56,359 --> 01:38:58,439
l didn't lie. Look Joseph! Hold her

660
01:38:58,890 --> 01:39:00,380
Hold her please

661
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:02,840
Just let me get my hands...

662
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:09,149
Merry Christmas

663
01:39:10,010 --> 01:39:11,060
Just a minute

664
01:39:11,369 --> 01:39:14,210
This is the biggest Christmas of my life

665
01:39:14,779 --> 01:39:16,010
Thank you

666
01:44:42,340 --> 01:44:46,699
Papa, he came to say that the people
liked our song very much

667
01:44:49,439 --> 01:44:50,810
He could wait till tomorrow

668
01:44:51,180 --> 01:44:53,989
But he wanted to share with us
this happiness today

669
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:28,930
You hate him

670
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:32,229
But l love him very much

671
01:45:32,850 --> 01:45:34,369
Too much

672
01:45:36,390 --> 01:45:38,939
Raj, you don't understand

673
01:45:39,460 --> 01:45:41,569
Papa is very angry

674
01:45:43,399 --> 01:45:44,890
He won't listen to anything

675
01:45:45,270 --> 01:45:46,760
Last night he was mad at me

676
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:49,130
He doesn't want me to have
anything to do with you again

677
01:45:49,569 --> 01:45:50,909
He says you can't come to our house

678
01:45:51,270 --> 01:45:52,850
And neither can l sing hereafter

679
01:45:53,239 --> 01:45:56,199
Annie, your hands are so pretty

680
01:45:56,779 --> 01:45:58,119
Your hands are very ugly

681
01:45:58,479 --> 01:45:59,739
Very funny!

682
01:46:00,449 --> 01:46:02,850
You shouldn't have come home
at that hour

683
01:46:03,350 --> 01:46:05,659
That's why Papa is annoyed
He IS right

684
01:46:06,149 --> 01:46:07,880
Hey, don't you go changing yourself

685
01:46:08,460 --> 01:46:11,479
Yesterday you were singing
something like... l'm very happy...

686
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:17,310
Okay, tomorrow l'll talk to your dad
about our marriage

687
01:46:18,369 --> 01:46:20,420
l don't think marriage would be possible

688
01:46:20,869 --> 01:46:23,909
Why ever not? It's very simple

689
01:46:24,510 --> 01:46:25,939
l will show you

690
01:46:26,539 --> 01:46:29,970
Raj is standing here
wearing a black suit, looking handsome

691
01:46:30,609 --> 01:46:31,630
Come, fatty

692
01:46:32,710 --> 01:46:35,430
Annie is here, standing near him
in a white dress, looking just okay

693
01:46:35,979 --> 01:46:36,680
The priest says,

694
01:46:36,949 --> 01:46:38,970
Raj, do you accept Annie
to be your wife?

695
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:40,029
l do

696
01:46:40,289 --> 01:46:42,020
Annie, do you accept Raj
as your husband?

697
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:43,149
Try to understand

698
01:46:43,460 --> 01:46:44,750
Do you?

699
01:46:45,130 --> 01:46:46,880
lt's not that simple...     Do you?

700
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:49,489
Do you?

701
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:50,729
l do

702
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,659
And now you may kiss the bride for...
one hour

703
01:46:54,399 --> 01:46:56,239
lt's not that easy as you make it sound

704
01:46:57,210 --> 01:46:58,909
Annie, l say stop otherwise...

705
01:46:59,439 --> 01:47:00,289
Otherwise what?

706
01:47:00,579 --> 01:47:02,100
Or else,  l will follow you

707
01:47:04,279 --> 01:47:05,210
Annie?

708
01:47:05,510 --> 01:47:06,680
Annie, stop

709
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:08,279
Annie, listen to me

710
01:47:08,619 --> 01:47:09,579
Annie, Annie!

711
01:47:09,890 --> 01:47:11,939
Annie, Annie, please wait, wait

712
01:47:12,390 --> 01:47:13,729
Sit here for a moment

713
01:47:14,489 --> 01:47:15,449
Look, l'm not kidding

714
01:47:15,789 --> 01:47:18,250
Tomorrow l will speak to your Dad

715
01:47:18,760 --> 01:47:20,460
You know, l even know the sign language

716
01:47:20,899 --> 01:47:23,180
Just watch. Hi! Bye!

717
01:47:23,670 --> 01:47:26,630
Flying kiss. Glad to meet you

718
01:47:28,170 --> 01:47:28,930
Too good

719
01:47:29,199 --> 01:47:30,630
Happy wedding

720
01:47:40,479 --> 01:47:44,380
l...do love...your daughter

721
01:47:45,220 --> 01:47:46,970
lt's good.  It'll work

722
01:47:48,619 --> 01:47:51,250
Looks like Uncle is sleeping

723
01:48:11,409 --> 01:48:13,460
Hello, sir. l am Raj

724
01:48:14,180 --> 01:48:16,489
l came to speak to you about Annie

725
01:48:16,989 --> 01:48:18,390
Your daughter Annie

726
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:21,840
About Annie

727
01:48:22,460 --> 01:48:23,479
You know, l...

728
01:48:23,829 --> 01:48:25,789
Do you understand what l am saying?

729
01:48:26,729 --> 01:48:27,520
Looks like he doesn't

730
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:30,720
Sir, Annie and l...

731
01:48:33,170 --> 01:48:36,239
Okay, let me put it down for you

732
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:38,680
What do you read; English or Hindi?

733
01:48:39,109 --> 01:48:40,810
Here

734
01:48:42,010 --> 01:48:42,770
Mr. Joseph!

735
01:48:43,039 --> 01:48:44,119
Uncle!

736
01:48:44,710 --> 01:48:46,899
Please listen to me

737
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:49,909
Sir, slowly. l have an ailing knee

738
01:48:50,750 --> 01:48:53,000
Sir, please listen to me

755

Okay, sir

Kill me

764
01:50:16,569 --> 01:50:19,289
l cannot live without your daughter
You might as well kill me

765
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:21,829
Come on, break my head

766
01:50:43,630 --> 01:50:47,170
Papa, please talk to Raj once
He wants to see you

767
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:53,239
So what if he is from Hindu caste?
Why can't we marry?

768
01:50:58,479 --> 01:51:00,909
You and mom also loved each other

769
01:51:01,420 --> 01:51:05,079
l am asking for your permission...
But you eloped with Mom

770
01:51:05,750 --> 01:51:06,539
Papa!

771
01:51:06,819 --> 01:51:08,460
Mama please explain to him

772
01:51:54,069 --> 01:51:55,270
They are here

773
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:57,000
Now it all depends on you

774
01:51:57,369 --> 01:51:59,180
Don't be nervous, okay?

775
01:52:00,279 --> 01:52:01,829
Smile please

776
01:52:19,359 --> 01:52:20,439
Hello Annie

777
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:21,659
My parents

778
01:52:22,729 --> 01:52:26,390
l've heard your song
You are as beautiful as your voice

779
01:52:27,069 --> 01:52:28,680
l won't flatter you

780
01:52:30,340 --> 01:52:31,630
Hello        Hello

781
01:52:31,970 --> 01:52:33,640
Meet my parents

782
01:52:35,039 --> 01:52:36,180
Hello

783
01:52:36,710 --> 01:52:39,020
Glad to meet you

784
01:52:39,510 --> 01:52:42,970
Raj always talks about you folks

785
01:52:44,090 --> 01:52:46,930
That's why we decided to...

786
01:52:47,890 --> 01:52:49,470
decided to see you

787
01:52:52,189 --> 01:52:54,029
Really, it's a very lovely place

788
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:56,229
As beautiful as you are

789
01:52:57,199 --> 01:52:58,250
Shall we go in?

790
01:52:58,569 --> 01:52:59,939
Please come in

791
01:53:51,050 --> 01:53:52,720
Your wife?

792
01:53:53,489 --> 01:53:55,920
Yeah she is very beautiful indeed

793
01:53:57,460 --> 01:54:00,390
He meant that Mama cooks very well

794
01:54:01,300 --> 01:54:04,899
He meant that his wife cooks very well

795
01:54:05,869 --> 01:54:10,380
Yes, very tasty food. Very nice

796
01:54:14,739 --> 01:54:16,170
Excuse me, may l have some water?

797
01:54:16,539 --> 01:54:18,789
Water, water

798
01:54:32,090 --> 01:54:33,789
Thank you

799
01:55:27,380 --> 01:55:29,369
Excuse me     Sure

800
01:55:50,710 --> 01:55:51,939
What's wrong with you?

801
01:55:52,270 --> 01:55:54,760
Didn't you promise not to be angry!

802
01:56:01,020 --> 01:56:04,210
l know that outsiders never visit us

803
01:56:04,989 --> 01:56:08,590
lt's hard for you. But it's hard
for them also. So is it for me

804
01:56:09,289 --> 01:56:10,460
Why are you losing heart?

805
01:56:10,789 --> 01:56:13,279
lt is a good opportunity
to open up to people

806
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:16,079
Mom, we all are a family now

807
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:19,020
Nobody is mocking you

808
01:56:19,470 --> 01:56:20,260
Just a minute

809
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:22,039
You have to trust them

810
01:56:22,399 --> 01:56:23,979
You have to try and reach out to them

811
01:56:24,369 --> 01:56:26,239
You never talk to others

812
01:56:26,670 --> 01:56:28,569
You are confined to your own world

813
01:56:29,010 --> 01:56:30,060
Why, mom? Why?

814
01:56:30,380 --> 01:56:32,600
Don't hide yourself from others

815
01:56:33,079 --> 01:56:36,590
Share your feelings with them

816
01:56:37,250 --> 01:56:39,329
Say something

817
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:09,510
Very strange people!

818
01:57:09,819 --> 01:57:11,430
They are making so much noise

819
01:57:12,020 --> 01:57:14,239
Mother, what seems noise to you...

820
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:17,159
is in fact a silence for them

821
01:58:19,649 --> 01:58:21,640
Check out my dive jump here

822
01:58:23,260 --> 01:58:24,779
Oh, my elbow, my elbow!

823
01:58:25,189 --> 01:58:26,420
Come, come

824
01:58:36,470 --> 01:58:37,399
One minute

825
01:58:41,140 --> 01:58:42,010
Here

826
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:44,149
Cover yourself. C'mon

827
01:58:51,819 --> 01:58:53,109
Was l exposed?

828
01:58:53,449 --> 01:58:55,380
Yeah, you know that thing... !

829
01:58:55,859 --> 01:58:57,149
That?

830
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:03,520
Hiccup

831
01:59:03,869 --> 01:59:05,130
Hiccup!

832
01:59:10,300 --> 01:59:13,369
l think somebody's missing you badly

833
01:59:14,180 --> 01:59:15,229
Must be my parents

834
01:59:15,539 --> 01:59:16,439
No! No, Please!

835
01:59:16,739 --> 01:59:17,819
No, l have to go

836
01:59:18,149 --> 01:59:20,050
No, look, please don't go
l mean, you've just come

837
01:59:20,479 --> 01:59:21,939
l got to go

838
01:59:22,579 --> 01:59:24,600
Tomorrow l am leaving

839
01:59:25,050 --> 01:59:26,779
You will have to spend whole day with me

840
01:59:27,189 --> 01:59:29,939
Without your hiccups and without
your Mama and Papa, okay?

841
01:59:30,529 --> 01:59:31,399
Okay

842
01:59:35,100 --> 01:59:36,359
Annie, my shirt!

843
01:59:36,699 --> 01:59:39,069
l will keep it with me

844
01:59:39,770 --> 01:59:41,550
l won't leave tomorrow if you don't come

845
01:59:41,970 --> 01:59:43,340
You have to come

846
02:00:00,720 --> 02:00:03,029
Joseph! Be careful!

847
02:00:30,420 --> 02:00:31,680
Mom, please

848
02:00:37,460 --> 02:00:39,979
Why do you employ
such handicapped people?

849
02:00:40,489 --> 02:00:42,949
Joseph has been working here
since last 1 5 years

850
02:00:43,460 --> 02:00:44,359
He is a good craftsman

851
02:00:44,670 --> 02:00:47,479
That's okay but any accident can happen

852
02:00:48,039 --> 02:00:49,090
Like it happened today

853
02:00:49,399 --> 02:00:52,710
You cannot alert him
because he can't hear

854
02:00:58,909 --> 02:01:00,779
Doctor, would his hand be alright?

855
02:01:01,220 --> 02:01:04,850
Yes, but it will take time to heal

856
02:01:06,989 --> 02:01:08,720
Do you have any other problem?

857
02:01:09,159 --> 02:01:10,359
Any other problem?

858
02:01:10,689 --> 02:01:13,649
Papa, any other complication?

859
02:01:18,829 --> 02:01:20,529
No, he is all right

860
02:01:21,539 --> 02:01:25,789
But his hand must be taken care of

861
02:01:27,069 --> 02:01:28,090
No, nothing will happen

862
02:01:28,409 --> 02:01:30,050
l will come home for the dressing

863
02:01:30,439 --> 02:01:33,100
Call me if there is any emergency

864
02:01:36,680 --> 02:01:39,369
Papa thanks you

865
02:01:41,859 --> 02:01:42,909
Thank you

866
02:01:44,489 --> 02:01:46,920
Annie, l have to speak to you. Come

867
02:02:00,210 --> 02:02:03,640
Look Annie, we will pay
for this treatment

868
02:02:04,779 --> 02:02:07,590
But we can't employ him further

869
02:02:08,779 --> 02:02:10,010
What did you say?

870
02:02:10,350 --> 02:02:11,840
He will have pension though

871
02:02:12,220 --> 02:02:13,329
We have our own problems...

872
02:02:13,649 --> 02:02:15,399
Papa's hand got burnt...

873
02:02:16,289 --> 02:02:19,069
and you're saying you want to sack him!

874
02:02:20,460 --> 02:02:23,420
He's worked at your place for 1 5 years

875
02:02:25,430 --> 02:02:27,859
This thing occurred at the job

876
02:02:29,270 --> 02:02:33,520
He is in such an agony and you want to
talk of pension!

877
02:02:34,979 --> 02:02:38,640
What do you think you are, huh?

878
02:02:54,829 --> 02:02:58,899
Papa says that he will
return to work soon

879
02:03:17,550 --> 02:03:18,979
Raj

880
02:03:21,090 --> 02:03:22,380
Raj

881
02:03:23,260 --> 02:03:24,550
Listen to me

882
02:03:25,260 --> 02:03:27,220
Mother was very upset

883
02:03:27,659 --> 02:03:29,800
l couldn't leave her alone

884
02:03:31,300 --> 02:03:32,909
Suddenly Papa...

885
02:03:33,399 --> 02:03:34,949
Mother! Papa!

886
02:03:36,970 --> 02:03:38,960
And what about me?

887
02:03:40,270 --> 02:03:42,899
Am l not a part of your life?

888
02:03:44,550 --> 02:03:47,800
You knew l wouldn't leave
without seeing you

889
02:03:49,079 --> 02:03:50,600
And yet you didn't come!

890
02:03:51,720 --> 02:03:52,979
You were right

891
02:03:53,319 --> 02:03:55,310
We live in two different worlds

892
02:03:57,359 --> 02:03:59,319
We can never be together

893
02:04:01,699 --> 02:04:04,510
Take care of your parents

894
02:04:05,569 --> 02:04:07,029
l am going

895
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:13,770
You are leaving?

896
02:04:18,979 --> 02:04:23,170
Now that l need you most
and you're leaving me alone?

897
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:25,970
Papa's hand got burnt

898
02:04:26,590 --> 02:04:29,430
His hand got burnt today

899
02:04:33,189 --> 02:04:35,680
And you know what these hands
mean to him!

900
02:04:36,199 --> 02:04:38,220
They are his voice

901
02:04:39,369 --> 02:04:42,180
But you will never understand!

902
02:10:24,850 --> 02:10:26,689
l know what you're thinking

903
02:10:27,109 --> 02:10:29,420
You're wondering if l will ever return

904
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:30,880
Right?

905
02:10:31,189 --> 02:10:32,649
You're just thinking that

906
02:10:33,750 --> 02:10:36,560
Look at me, Annie

907
02:10:48,340 --> 02:10:50,149
Hello! Not now

908
02:10:50,569 --> 02:10:51,770
Later when l come back

909
02:10:52,109 --> 02:10:54,539
You're really pretty when you smile

910
02:10:55,180 --> 02:10:56,550
You look very...

911
02:10:57,279 --> 02:10:58,680
very ugly

912
02:10:59,750 --> 02:11:00,600
l love you

913
02:11:00,880 --> 02:11:04,130
l had my fears when l saw Raj leaving

914
02:11:05,119 --> 02:11:07,750
What if he didn't return!

915
02:11:08,689 --> 02:11:11,760
Now you're always with me

916
02:11:12,859 --> 02:11:16,369
Not only in my dreams,
but in my body too

917
02:11:17,600 --> 02:11:22,869
Raj, my mind is full of
aspirations and fear

918
02:11:24,470 --> 02:11:26,489
l have started loving myself

919
02:11:26,939 --> 02:11:29,600
Because he is in my body now

920
02:11:31,010 --> 02:11:32,850
l wish you were here!

921
02:11:33,449 --> 02:11:36,260
How will l explain to Mom and Dad?

922
02:11:37,149 --> 02:11:39,840
l have made a mistake

923
02:11:43,989 --> 02:11:45,329
Abortion?

924
02:11:49,399 --> 02:11:51,539
For the fear of what people might say!

925
02:11:54,899 --> 02:11:56,390
Wise thing?

926
02:11:57,500 --> 02:12:00,460
ls abortion a wise thing to do?

927
02:12:01,579 --> 02:12:04,600
l won't go against the church

928
02:12:05,909 --> 02:12:08,399
l will not go against God

929
02:12:13,050 --> 02:12:15,239
You don't have faith in God

930
02:12:16,619 --> 02:12:19,229
But you have faith in life

931
02:12:20,189 --> 02:12:22,329
You want to kill my love?

932
02:12:27,100 --> 02:12:30,350
We will soon marry,
don't you go getting upset

933
02:12:33,739 --> 02:12:35,699
Raj will surely come back

934
02:12:40,680 --> 02:12:41,970
He will accept me

935
02:12:42,319 --> 02:12:45,720
l don't care about people
You just accept me as l am

936
02:12:53,890 --> 02:12:55,260
l will stay here

937
02:12:55,659 --> 02:12:58,819
ln this house with my baby

938
02:13:18,090 --> 02:13:19,609
You are right

939
02:13:20,119 --> 02:13:23,140
l wish l had died instead of Sam

940
02:13:52,819 --> 02:13:54,279
Papa!

941
02:13:55,489 --> 02:13:58,069
What are you doing?

942
02:14:23,119 --> 02:14:25,260
Don't beat her!

943
02:14:25,720 --> 02:14:28,970
Don't fight because of me

944
02:14:53,979 --> 02:14:55,789
Listen to me!

945
02:14:56,220 --> 02:14:58,239
l am not irresponsible

946
02:14:58,850 --> 02:15:02,130
For twenty years l forgot my existence
and lived for you

947
02:15:02,789 --> 02:15:04,720
And you call me irresponsible!

948
02:15:06,989 --> 02:15:08,979
l am not

949
02:15:10,699 --> 02:15:14,270
For you l was only a voice

950
02:15:16,539 --> 02:15:18,500
Two soaps for five rupees

951
02:15:19,810 --> 02:15:22,649
l didn't know the meaning of this

952
02:15:24,140 --> 02:15:27,479
But l kept on saying it
on your insistence

953
02:15:28,180 --> 02:15:31,020
And now you accuse me of being
negligent of my duties

954
02:15:36,890 --> 02:15:41,310
People used to taunt you
and only l could hear

955
02:15:42,659 --> 02:15:45,619
l even couldn't cry
because you were there

956
02:15:46,829 --> 02:15:49,409
And l am irresponsible!

957
02:15:50,739 --> 02:15:54,140
When you bought a coffin for Mariam

958
02:15:54,979 --> 02:15:58,409
At that time l didn't know
what death was

959
02:15:59,449 --> 02:16:02,520
And you blamed me for Sam's death

960
02:16:03,180 --> 02:16:05,109
And l am irresponsible!

961
02:16:05,590 --> 02:16:07,869
l am irresponsible

962
02:16:13,289 --> 02:16:17,270
l didn't get to enjoy my childhood

963
02:16:18,199 --> 02:16:20,569
And now that l want to attain motherhood

964
02:16:21,069 --> 02:16:24,470
you want to take away that too from me

965
02:16:30,079 --> 02:16:33,479
Whole life l supported you,

966
02:16:34,750 --> 02:16:36,420
looked after you

967
02:16:38,850 --> 02:16:40,780
Now it's your turn

968
02:16:43,290 --> 02:16:46,280
Until you bear this responsibility...

969
02:16:47,829 --> 02:16:50,379
l will not return home

970
02:16:51,530 --> 02:16:52,760
Did you hear?

971
02:16:53,670 --> 02:16:55,190
Did you hear me?

972
02:16:55,840 --> 02:16:59,059
Two for five rupees, sir. Please buy it

973
02:16:59,670 --> 02:17:00,809
Give us one more chance

974
02:17:01,139 --> 02:17:02,100
Speak with smile

975
02:17:02,409 --> 02:17:04,750
Who taught me this?

976
02:18:23,389 --> 02:18:26,899
l am sorry. It was a mistake on my part

977
02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:36,889
No, mama

978
02:18:37,200 --> 02:18:38,979
lt's not your mistake

979
02:18:39,670 --> 02:18:42,100
l shouldn't have said all that
Sorry, Mama

980
02:18:44,139 --> 02:18:45,870
l am sorry

981
02:18:49,719 --> 02:18:51,239
Papa has agreed?

982
02:19:01,129 --> 02:19:04,639
Being a mother yourself
you're suggesting abortion?

983
02:19:24,950 --> 02:19:28,870
So what if my child were like you?

984
02:19:30,219 --> 02:19:31,920
So what if he's born deaf?

985
02:19:32,690 --> 02:19:34,829
My child will be a part of me

986
02:19:35,829 --> 02:19:39,430
l would never curse my child

987
02:19:51,209 --> 02:19:53,639
No, mother!

988
02:19:58,319 --> 02:20:02,219
l know your life has been
that of hardships

989
02:20:02,959 --> 02:20:07,680
Even then you lived your life
so courageously

990
02:20:08,629 --> 02:20:12,379
l was never sorry
that you were my parents

991
02:20:14,069 --> 02:20:16,559
l am proud of you

992
02:20:19,739 --> 02:20:24,780
lf my child were like you,
l'd be proud of it too

993
02:20:28,420 --> 02:20:30,700
After all it'd be my own child,

994
02:20:32,319 --> 02:20:35,100
my own flesh and blood

995
02:20:50,239 --> 02:20:51,700
Goa! Yeah

996
02:20:54,170 --> 02:20:55,510
Okay everybody!

997
02:20:55,879 --> 02:20:58,219
Bye! See you. Have a nice time

998
02:21:25,639 --> 02:21:27,780
A frilly frock for Annie! Yeah

999
02:21:55,270 --> 02:21:56,639
Annie!

1000
02:21:57,799 --> 02:21:59,440
Driver, please stop the bus

1001
02:21:59,840 --> 02:22:01,709
Annie, l love you

1002
02:22:02,479 --> 02:22:03,350
Raj!

1003
02:22:04,579 --> 02:22:05,690
Raj!

1004
02:22:06,209 --> 02:22:08,110
Listen, she needs to get on the bus

1005
02:22:08,780 --> 02:22:09,829
Hey, watch out there

1006
02:22:10,149 --> 02:22:11,200
Sorry

1007
02:22:12,149 --> 02:22:12,940
Thank you

1008
02:22:13,850 --> 02:22:16,280
Stop! Stop the bus

1009
02:22:17,190 --> 02:22:18,680
Thank you, driver

1010
02:22:19,989 --> 02:22:21,690
Annie!

1011
02:22:22,459 --> 02:22:23,479
Annie!

1012
02:22:26,129 --> 02:22:28,239
Stop the bus

1013
02:22:29,239 --> 02:22:30,700
Stop the bus please

1014
02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:33,600
What are you doing?
You are stepping on my feet

1015
02:22:47,049 --> 02:22:48,159
Raj

1016
02:22:49,420 --> 02:22:50,940
Stop the bus

1017
02:22:51,620 --> 02:22:53,319
Annie, l miss you

1018
02:22:54,030 --> 02:22:56,459
Excuse me, please stop the bus

1019
02:23:00,829 --> 02:23:02,500
Stop the bus!

1020
02:23:22,389 --> 02:23:23,469
What is it?

1021
02:23:24,360 --> 02:23:25,260
Nothing

1022
02:23:26,229 --> 02:23:27,459
l love you

1023
02:23:35,569 --> 02:23:39,440
You look lovely when you smile

1024
02:23:40,540 --> 02:23:42,059
You look very...

1025
02:23:44,010 --> 02:23:45,180
ugly

1026
02:23:46,250 --> 02:23:48,090
Beautiful

1027
02:24:24,850 --> 02:24:27,870
Papa, it was a mistake on our part

1028
02:24:28,690 --> 02:24:30,329
Please forgive us

1029
02:24:41,069 --> 02:24:43,729
We never wanted to go away from you

1030
02:24:44,899 --> 02:24:47,680
We always wanted to come close to you

1031
02:24:50,079 --> 02:24:53,100
l know one day he will forgive me

1032
02:25:34,920 --> 02:25:36,969
You may kiss the bride

1033
02:26:42,719 --> 02:26:45,149
lt all seems just like yesterday

1034
02:26:45,989 --> 02:26:47,329
Our wedding

1035
02:26:48,129 --> 02:26:49,940
Papa and Mom were not there

1036
02:26:50,399 --> 02:26:53,180
The happiest moment of my life,

1037
02:26:53,729 --> 02:26:56,569
was so incomplete without them

1038
02:27:56,899 --> 02:27:58,329
Hello

1039
02:28:22,090 --> 02:28:26,250
Yeah, Raj also says that
he looks like Papa

1040
02:28:27,290 --> 02:28:29,870
Mom, where is Papa?

1041
02:28:53,520 --> 02:28:56,010
Annie taught me

1042
02:29:39,530 --> 02:29:41,579
Sam

1043
02:29:48,010 --> 02:29:49,940
Your son Sam

1044
02:31:31,979 --> 02:31:35,520
ln the name of the Father
the Son and the holy ghost

1045
02:31:36,180 --> 02:31:38,170
l hereby baptise you

1046
02:31:39,889 --> 02:31:42,319
God bless you my son

1047
02:31:48,659 --> 02:31:51,149
Once again we had faith in God

1048
02:31:51,799 --> 02:31:55,260
And all the joys of life came back

1049
02:31:56,239 --> 02:31:59,610
Sam has come back in our lives

1050
02:32:00,469 --> 02:32:02,219
Our best wishes are with him

1051
02:32:02,909 --> 02:32:05,520
Annie grew up in our tiny village

1052
02:32:06,250 --> 02:32:08,940
Today she has become famous

1053
02:32:09,479 --> 02:32:11,229
Singing Star

1054
02:32:12,590 --> 02:32:15,719
We are happy for Raj and Annie's success

1055
02:32:16,690 --> 02:32:18,180
But we are sad to see them leaving,

1056
02:32:18,590 --> 02:32:21,200
on such a occasion l want...
Actually all of us wish...

1057
02:32:22,059 --> 02:32:25,459
Joseph to come on stage
and share his feelings with us

1058
02:32:26,100 --> 02:32:27,739
Come Joseph

1059
02:32:28,930 --> 02:32:30,299
Come on, Joseph

1060
02:32:32,469 --> 02:32:33,959
Don't be shy. Come on

1061
02:32:34,340 --> 02:32:36,270
Everybody wants to hear you

1062
02:32:36,809 --> 02:32:38,559
Go. Come on

1063
02:32:55,959 --> 02:32:57,250
Today...

1064
02:32:58,100 --> 02:32:59,500
l am very happy

1065
02:32:59,870 --> 02:33:01,270
l don't believe that...

1066
02:33:02,170 --> 02:33:04,159
you all wish to hear me

1067
02:33:05,200 --> 02:33:07,309
There are so many more things
that l want to say,

1068
02:33:07,770 --> 02:33:09,440
but l feel at a loss to express myself

1069
02:33:10,680 --> 02:33:17,420
Since childhood people have been
calling me handicapped

1070
02:33:21,190 --> 02:33:22,940
They'd come at our place...

1071
02:33:23,760 --> 02:33:26,280
look at me and call me deaf and dumb

1072
02:33:26,790 --> 02:33:28,129
They pitied me

1073
02:33:29,159 --> 02:33:31,329
Some people even made fun of me,

1074
02:33:31,829 --> 02:33:33,059
laugh at me

1075
02:33:33,670 --> 02:33:35,750
But today l have no complaints to God

1076
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:38,870
l am happy, contented

1077
02:33:39,540 --> 02:33:45,020
l am deaf and dumb that's why
l got Flavy

1078
02:33:49,979 --> 02:33:51,709
l am proud of my Flavy

1079
02:33:52,420 --> 02:33:57,309
Whether l was wrong or right...

1080
02:34:01,129 --> 02:34:03,319
Flavy always stood by me

1081
02:34:06,129 --> 02:34:10,850
She has been a great inspiration
in my life

1082
02:34:11,670 --> 02:34:14,540
ln each and every way

1083
02:34:19,549 --> 02:34:23,149
l wish her all the best

1084
02:34:24,950 --> 02:34:27,379
l am always with you

1085
02:34:29,690 --> 02:34:31,559
Thank you

1086
02:34:35,590 --> 02:34:40,250
Flavy provided me
the most beautiful dream of my life

1087
02:34:41,899 --> 02:34:44,299
Our daughter Annie

1088
02:34:46,440 --> 02:34:51,420
We were fortunate to have Annie
in our life

1089
02:34:52,510 --> 02:34:55,440
But l wouldn't know if the same
would be true for her

1090
02:34:56,649 --> 02:35:01,780
She had to suffer a lot for our sake

1091
02:35:02,760 --> 02:35:04,930
She became our voice

1092
02:35:06,629 --> 02:35:08,440
She had to struggle hard

1093
02:35:09,500 --> 02:35:14,860
l used to take her with me to sell soap

1094
02:35:17,139 --> 02:35:19,159
Two for five rupees, two for five rupees

1095
02:35:19,610 --> 02:35:20,870
l would scold her

1096
02:35:21,209 --> 02:35:24,639
l would tell her to smile
to speak louder

1097
02:35:28,079 --> 02:35:30,950
And l kicked her out of the house...

1098
02:35:32,579 --> 02:35:34,719
when she was pregnant

1099
02:35:37,290 --> 02:35:40,309
But never did she complain

1100
02:35:41,159 --> 02:35:43,299
Always kept silent

1101
02:35:53,309 --> 02:35:55,500
Forgive me

1102
02:36:03,450 --> 02:36:05,180
Thank you

1103
02:36:11,620 --> 02:36:16,010
And then God sent Raj for Annie

1104
02:36:21,430 --> 02:36:25,500
He came in her life
like Prince Charming

1105
02:36:28,840 --> 02:36:33,590
Raj gave her so much happiness,
which we weren't able to

1106
02:36:41,120 --> 02:36:43,549
l always hated Raj

1107
02:36:44,389 --> 02:36:46,790
l don't know why

1108
02:37:02,040 --> 02:37:03,559
Okay

1109
02:37:06,280 --> 02:37:08,329
l won't be able to continue

1110
02:37:16,190 --> 02:37:22,110
Do you think trees can speak and hear?

1111
02:37:23,799 --> 02:37:25,350
Sure they can

1112
02:37:25,729 --> 02:37:29,040
The same way l and Flavy communicate

1113
02:37:30,700 --> 02:37:33,100
l have talked to trees

1114
02:37:34,040 --> 02:37:37,409
l ask them everything

1115
02:37:39,979 --> 02:37:44,959
Even today l can hear Mariam's voice

1116
02:37:47,520 --> 02:37:49,799
Her songs

1117
02:37:51,959 --> 02:37:55,180
Her voice is always with us

1118
02:37:55,889 --> 02:38:04,069
The same way Annie will always be
with us

1119
02:38:08,010 --> 02:38:12,670
We will feel her in the rays of sun

1120
02:38:14,709 --> 02:38:17,959
She would become a bird
and come to see me

1121
02:38:24,760 --> 02:38:27,250
Annie lives in my heart

1122
02:38:35,299 --> 02:38:38,260
She can never go away

1123
02:39:11,899 --> 02:39:15,090
Papa! Doctors say
Annie is in poor condition

1124
02:39:16,010 --> 02:39:18,440
They have almost given up on her

1125
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:21,229
Do something, Papa!

1126
02:39:22,850 --> 02:39:24,690
l can't live without her

1127
02:39:25,719 --> 02:39:28,680
And l know neither can you

1128
02:39:29,889 --> 02:39:31,229
Papa, call her back

1129
02:39:32,059 --> 02:39:33,809
She is slowly drifting away

1130
02:39:34,260 --> 02:39:36,840
Say something

1131
02:39:37,459 --> 02:39:41,120
Talk to her. She will come back
to hear your voice

1132
02:39:41,799 --> 02:39:43,139
Speak to her!

1133
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:45,389
Papa, please

1134
02:39:46,309 --> 02:39:47,920
Papa

1135
02:39:49,440 --> 02:39:50,959
Say something

1136
02:39:51,909 --> 02:39:53,280
Speak out

1137
02:39:53,780 --> 02:39:57,000
She always wanted to hear her name
called out from your lips

1138
02:39:57,979 --> 02:39:59,790
Throughout her life
she has been your voice

1139
02:40:00,219 --> 02:40:01,770
You will have to bring her back

1140
02:40:02,149 --> 02:40:03,110
You will have to!

1141
02:40:03,420 --> 02:40:05,149
You'll have to

1142
02:40:05,760 --> 02:40:08,479
l cannot live without her

1143
02:40:09,059 --> 02:40:11,549
Raj, take a hold of yourself

1144
02:40:12,059 --> 02:40:14,200
Call her ''Annie'' once
and she will come back

1145
02:40:14,770 --> 02:40:16,959
Papa, bring her back!

1146
02:40:17,670 --> 02:40:18,959
Come on

1147
02:40:20,870 --> 02:40:22,680
Come, sit her

1148
02:40:47,600 --> 02:40:49,149
Annie?

1149
02:41:54,930 --> 02:41:55,950
Papa!

1150
02:42:09,920 --> 02:42:15,219
Annie, you look very pretty
when you laugh

1151
02:42:17,159 --> 02:42:19,739
You look very ugly
