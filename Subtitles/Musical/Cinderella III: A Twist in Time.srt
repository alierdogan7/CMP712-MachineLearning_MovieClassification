Perhaps we should just...
get on with it.

Quite, Madame. Quite.

No. It can't be.

Would Your Grace excuse me?

160
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,560
I must have a word with my... maid.

You look confused, dear.

How could the slipper
have fit Anastasia?

165
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,439
I danced with the Prince.
That was my slipper.

166
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:15,969
Here, I have the other one.
I'm the one he's looking for.

167
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:19,848
You may have danced with him.
You may even have thought it was love.

168
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,822
But the slipper fits Anastasia,
and that's who he's marrying.

169
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:28,758
Whatever you think happened
last night was a dream.

I don't care where you go
or what you do,

172
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:41,029
but you stay away from the palace.

173
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:44,167
Stay away from the Prince.

174
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,675
Oh and... clean up that broken glass.

Yes, of course he does.

- [man 2] Good morning.

The King is waiting. There you are.

[grunts] Well, she was the one.

I know it.

00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:07,153
[King] You think there's only
one woman in the kingdom

You said the first time
you touched her hand...

290
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,245
...you just knew... instantly.

291
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:39,256
Mmm. The stars were brighter that night.

292
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:42,452

Of course I'm in the right room. Um...

Well there... There seems to be...
a little mix-up here.

Oh, yeah, I see. Um...

308
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:47,121
It's just that I was expecting...
Well, someone else.

309
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:49,786
I really do feel awful about this.

310
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,057
But the royal proclamation declared...

311
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:56,727
Yes, but it would appear that,
uh, more than one girl

312
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,600
actually fits the... the slipper.

313
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:03,038
[clears throat] I'm very sorry
to have inconvenienced you. Um...

314
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:07,408
Why don't I have the Grand Duke
escort you home safely.

Phew!

- But... but...
- Quiet!

318
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,513
You will forget who you
danced with at the ball,

319
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,081
and marry the girl
who fits the slipper...

320

Wait. Hold the trumpet!

It's all coming back.

324
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:53,554
It is you.

00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,388
[both gasp]

326
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,655
Please. Please tell me your name.

327
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,961
It's... Anastasia.

328
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,864
[sighs] Anastasia.

329
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:07,530
Well, I... I know it's sudden,
but will you marry me?

330
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,506
Yes! Yippee!

I... I mean, yes. Definitely yes.

337
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:36,161
I will marry you.

338
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:40,171
Excellent. The ceremony
will take place tonight.

339
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,072
I trust that meets
with your approval, sire.

340
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,075
The sooner the better.

341
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:48,943
Splendid. Then tonight
we will have a new princess.

342
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,039
Wonderful. I'll go tell my father.

343
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:54,313
Not good! We have
to find Cinderelly, Gus Gus!

352
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:46,804
Lucifer?

353
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,805
[meows]

354
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:56,411
- Lucifer! Come here!
- [snarls]

355
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:09,759
Phew.

356
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,625
[gasps]

357
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,697
[Cinderella] Your Highness.

358
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,064
Yes?

359
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,433
Hello. [giggles]

360
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,870
Um... Hello.

361
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,306
It's wonderful to see you again.

362
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:28,176
Um... I'm sorry, have we met?

363
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:29,975
[giggles]

364
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:33,313
I believe we danced
last night at the ball.

365
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,046
[chuckles]

366
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,784
Well, uh... maybe you've
mistaken me for some other prince.

367
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,791
I don't think so.

368
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,728
You are quite the dancer.

369
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,231
Well, it wasn't just me.

370
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,895
It was the lady I was...

371
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,835
...dancing with.

372
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:04,078
Oh, Your Highness.

373
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:08,142
Uh... As a matter of fact,
I'm gonna marry her.

374
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,381
Marry? Really?

375
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,082
Yes! Tonight.

376
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:13,419
Tonight?

377
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,926
Once you dance
with someone like Anastasia,

378
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,825
you don't want to waste any time.

379
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,864
Did you say Anastasia?

380
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,023
Yes.

381
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:22,895
But...

382
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,598
Well... I guess I better be going.

383
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:33,109
I've got to tell my father.

384
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,339
- But that's not right.
- I'm sorry?

385
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,577
You there. Royal mouse catcher!
I need you this...

386
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:43,087
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry,
Your Grace. I didn't realize...

387
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,247
I was the one...

388
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:47,416
I need her this instant!
Please excuse us, Your Highness?

389
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:49,483
Please. I'm sorry, just one moment.

390
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:52,325
No, no, no. Of course,
I can see you're busy.

391
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:54,592
I'll... I'll let you go.

392
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,092
But... it was me.

393
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:19,655
Start here! I want this castle
completely rodent-free

394
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:21,715
in time for the wedding.

395
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,030
[door slams]

396
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:46,244
[Gus] Cinderelly! Cinderelly!

397
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,615
Gus?

398
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,017
Cinderelly!

399
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:50,645
[both] Whoa!

400
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,189
[Jaq] We found Princey!

401
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:56,159
I did too. But he doesn't
even know who I am.

402
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:58,120
No, no, no!

403
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,660
It's a magic.

404
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,666
What? What are you talking about?

405
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:07,694
[both babble incoherently]

406
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:09,103
Stepmother?

407
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:13,911
- Fairy Godmother?
- Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

408
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:15,173
She stole it?

409
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,147
- [bawling]
- I show Princey!

410
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,744
Princey! Princey!

411
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,287
My Cinderelly awaits.

412
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,324
Princey, you will marry Anastasia.

413
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:27,881
Anesthesia.

414
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,484
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

415
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:34,532
She made him forget who I am.

416
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,967
Magic! That explains it.

417
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:44,333
Boys, we have to get that wand!

418
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,835
Madame, the King himself
has instructed me

419
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,643
to be solely in charge of this affair.

420
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:54,151
I assure you
I have it entirely under control.

421
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,914
Oh, really?

422
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:57,613
[scoffs]

423
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:00,653
[Anastasia and Drizella gasp]

424
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,386
[Anastasia] Look at that!

425
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,360
It's perfect!

426
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:05,657
[Drizella cackling]

427
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:13,427
They smell lovely.

428
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:15,598
Dispose of those roses at once.

429
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,505
Anastasia's health is quite...

430
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,009
Ah-choo!

431
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:21,943
...delicate.

432
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:24,447
I'm quite sure
I mentioned that to you.

433
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:28,179
- Madame, I do not...
- Quite sure.

434
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,209
Yes.

435
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:35,351
Well, perhaps the young ladies
would like to sample the hors d'oeuvres.

436
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,088
[Anastasia and Drizella gasp]

437
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,220
Your Grace, a word.

438
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:41,663
[mutters]

439
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:44,896
These preparations
are entirely unacceptable.

440
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,200
[slurping]

441
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,967
What a pig!

442
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,737
[Drizella] Who's the pig now?

443
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:56,576
[laughs]

444
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:00,474
[Stepmother] You call this a cake?

445
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,713
[snarling]

446
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,484
This wedding must reflect
my daughter's elegance.

447
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:10,257
Drizella will be singing
in the ceremony.

448
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:12,319
Are you sure that's a good idea?

449
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:19,837
Oh, wait till you meet her, Dad.
She has everything.

450
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:23,203
- Breeding, refinement...
- Yes, yes.

451
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,110
No!

452
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:31,946
[plate shattering]

453
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,008
Are we in the right room?

454
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:36,485
You! How could you let this happen?

455
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:39,079
[laughs nervously] Don't mind this.

456
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,648
I shall have it cleaned up in no time.

457
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,591
See that you do!

458
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:47,257
I want this wedding
to go off without a hitch.

459
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,766
And if it doesn't...

460
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,837
Oh, no! Please, sire...

461
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,804
I can explain. I well, you see...

462
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:59,401
Father, allow me to introduce
my bride-to-be, Anastasia.

463
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,810
Anastasia, this is my dad.

464
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,748
It is an honor, Your Majesty.

465
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:08,513
Charmed, I'm sure.

466
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:19,560
So who's up for a dance?

467
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:24,559
[Stepmother] Your little escapade back
there could have cost us everything!

468
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:26,194
Don't ruin this!

469
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:28,239
Go get him, twinkle toes.

470
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:31,503
[orchestra warms up]

471
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,479
Oh, I don't dance much.

472
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,988
You're too modest.
That's how we met, remember?

473
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,250
Oh, right. Of course.

474
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:49,054
I'll never forget
when I first touched...

475
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,687
...your hand.

476
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:58,031
[orchestra plays <i>Blue Danube</i>]

477
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:08,670
- [groans]
- Oh! I'm sorry.

478
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,214
It won't happen again.

479
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:17,220
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

480
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:19,178
[Prince groans]

481
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,782
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

482
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,088
[gasps]

483
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:26,562
- [groans]
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

484
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:28,462
- [moans]
- Oh!

485
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,871
[screams]

486
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,032
I'm sorry.

487
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:41,906
Oh, dear. [whimpers]

488
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,779
Um... Are you OK?

489
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:53,922
Oh! Oh, sorry, these aren't my shoes.

490
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:57,359
I mean, what am I saying?
Of course they're my shoes.

491
00:29:57,428 --> 00:30:00,886
Oh, I just don't know
what's wrong with me today.

492
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,126
Oh, no, no, it was my fault.

493
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:06,500
I'm afraid I'm just not up-to-date
on the latest dance steps.

494
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:10,667
[clears throat]
Sire, if I may, um, your fitting.

495
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:15,145
Oh. Oh, yes.
This was fun. Thank you.

496
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:17,875
Well, if you'll please excuse me.

497
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,882
[chuckles] Um, come along, sire.

498
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:25,252
And after the fitting,
we must approve the butter sculpture.

499
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,416
I think it's a stunning likeness.

500
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,154
# <i>La-la-la-la-la-la...</i>

501
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,992
Well, no grace, no poise.

502
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:35,794
Other than that, it was lovely.

503
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:38,597
He was nice to me.

504
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,605
[snickering] That's because
he's under a spell.

505
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,836
He'd have to be, to fall for you.

506
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:47,941
It's more than that.

507
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,377
[King] Ladies!

508
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:53,774
[Stepmother] Your Majesty!

509
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:58,812
[King] I need to speak with my future
daughter-in-law immediately.

510
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:02,620
Alone!

511
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:11,360
Let's make a run for it while we can.

512
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:15,839
No, sire, sire, I'll have a dozen
dance instructors sent in immediately.

513
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,238
Something's wrong.

514
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:19,606
[gasping] An army of dance instructors.

515
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:20,939
No, no.

516
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:24,641
I thought... Why, I was sure
it was Anastasia last night.

517
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,877
But...

518
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:29,511
...well, just now when
I touched her hand...

519
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,550
...I felt...

520
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,392
...nothing.

521
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,861
Oh, I can explain everything,
Your Majesty.

522
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,364
I have this,
this inner ear thing and, and...

523
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:45,129
You, my dear, are a dreadful dancer.

524
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:48,834
Yes, I know, Your Majesty.

525
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,068
Reminds me of my queen.

526
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:53,702
She trod on my feet too.

527
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:58,738
But she took very good care of my heart.

528
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:01,915
[chuckling] Come here, my dear.

529
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,649
I want to show you something.

530
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:11,393
A princess is bestowed with many riches.

531
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,894
Land, jewels, horses.

532
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:21,601
But today I wish to give you
something much more valuable.

533
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:26,232
Oh.

534
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:27,972
Isn't it lovely?

535
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,676
A seashell?

536
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:35,208
This shell was the queen's
most treasured possession.

537
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:39,985
We found it while
walking by the water the day we met.

538
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,822
You see, we reached
for it at the same moment,

539
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:46,421
and when our hands touched... [chuckles]

540
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:50,297
...that's when I knew
I had found true love.

541
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:54,800
You knew that just by touching her hand?

542
00:32:54,872 --> 00:33:00,811
There's no more powerful
force in the world than true love.

543
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:10,080
[clears throat]
Well, that's all. Run along, now.

544
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:13,646
- Run along.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

545
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,422
I do.

546
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,984
Oh, I do.

547
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,927
I do. I do.

548
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,196
I really do.

549
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,066
[giggles]

550
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,663
[gasps] Oh!

551
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,772
[giggles]

552
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,004
Oh, I do.

553
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:42,279
# <i>Now there is finally</i>
<i>someone to love me</i>

554
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:46,847
# <i>He'll show me a world</i>
<i>that I never knew</i>

555
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:52,055
# <i>With two simple words,</i>
<i>all my dreams will come true</i>

556
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,961
# <i>I do</i>

557
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:58,799
# <i>I do</i> #

558
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,282
[chirping]

559
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,548
You go get the Prince.

560
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,783
[Drizella cackling] Bigger!

561
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:21,825
Ooh, let's try this!

562
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:24,856
Oh, that's gorgeous.

563
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:29,500
[laughs]

564
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,057
Lovely.

565
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:34,161
Drizella, stop that this instant!

566
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,671
[groans]

567
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,436
This wand is not a toy.

568
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:41,444
It's in the dresser.
Key's in her pocket.

569
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:45,573
[grunts]

570
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,015
I've got to get in there.

571
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,712
Cinderelly! They'll see you!

572
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,515
- Yeah, too dangerous.
- But I...

573
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,112
We'll take care of it!

574
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,555
[Anastasia] I do.

575
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:55,990
I do.

576
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,391
I do.

577
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,896
I do. Oh, I do.

578
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:13,571
Alright, but whatever you do,
stay clear of Lucifer.

579
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:16,010
Zug-zug. No Lucifee.

580
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:18,744
What happened?
What'd the King say?

581
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:20,078
[groans]

582
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,210
He's really very nice.

583
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:25,050
He gave me his most prized possession.

584
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,591
[scoffs] A seashell?

585
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:29,387
It's a symbol of true love.

586
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,620
[yelps]

587
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,061
Oh, please.

588
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:38,159
- [scoffs] How special.
- [Anastasia] He said that his heart...

589
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:41,865
[Stepmother] What's love compared
to the power we hold with the wand?

590
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:44,066
You will learn that soon enough.

591
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,473
[snoring]

592
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,773
[Anastasia]
I want the Prince to love me.

593
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:49,813
I think he could.

594
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:53,146
[Drizella cackling] Oh, you're serious.

595
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:55,742
[Anastasia] Well, the King likes me too.

596
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,620
He treated me like his own daughter.
Maybe we shouldn't be doing this.

597
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:02,957
[Drizella] Maybe I should
have put on the slipper.

598
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:04,016
[sniffing]

599
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:06,529
[Anastasia] Maybe we don't
even need the wand.

600
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:08,189
[meows]

601
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:11,327
[yelps]

602
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,395
Oh!

603
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:18,033
[Drizella] Oh! Somebody put out the cat!

604
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:24,273
[Anastasia] Lucifer!
Oh, hold still! Stop!

605
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,224
- Lucifer!
- [meows]

606
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,696
[Stepmother sighs]
Someone fetch the housekeeper.

607
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:44,000
[knocking]

608
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:45,865
[Cinderella] Housekeeping.

609
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,039
Well, you certainly came quickly.

610
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:54,907
[clears throat] We're very good.

611
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:03,848
Clean this up. My daughter needs her
beauty sleep before tonight's wedding.

612
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:06,515
[scoffs] Think that'll be enough time?

613
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:25,065
Keep out of the maid's way, girls.

614
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:28,077
There's a lot to do before the wedding.

615
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:30,846
Hmm?

616
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,212
[straining]

617
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,679
Isn't that right, Cinderella?

618
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:41,587
[gasps] I didn't know you worked here.

619
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:46,060
You're far more persistent
than I thought.

620
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,030
I won't let you get away with this.

621
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,091
- We already have.
- I don't think so.

622
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:52,760
Jaq! Gus!

623
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,769
[both shout]

624
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,807
- The wand!
- [both shriek]

625
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:59,434
[snarling]

626
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,102
[Gus] Us coming, Cinderelly!

627
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:04,105
- [thud]
- [meows]

628
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:06,844
[Jaq] Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

629
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:10,454
That servant girl is a thief! Get her!

630
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:13,921
Zug-zug.

631
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:17,588
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

632
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:25,962
[snarls]

633
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,971
[guard] Stop! Thief!

634
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:33,670
- Seize her at once!
- Don't move! Hold it!

635
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:35,234
Halt in the name of the King!

636
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,247
[both] Whoa!

637
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,022
You incompetent fools!

638
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,022
[both] Whoa!

639
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:56,127
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

640
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:57,723
[meows]

641
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:59,099
[chuckles]

642
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:02,329
[snarling]

643
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,475
Gus Gus!

644
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:14,944
- [screaming]
- [snarling]

645
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,850
Run, Gus Gus!

646
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,445
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

647
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:29,399
[both shriek]

648
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,628
[guard] There she is! We've got her.

649
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,135
You there, halt!

650
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,138
Halt!

651
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,365
Open up in the name of the King!

652
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:41,002
- [chirping]
- [grunting]

653
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:43,137
Oh, hello.

654
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,705
Oh! Hey! What's going on?

655
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:48,309
Hmm.

656
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,378
Uh... Alright, I'm coming.

657
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:52,854
[Jaq] Cinderelly!

658
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:54,515
[guard] Open up, I say!

659
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,253
Gus Gus!

660
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,494
Catch.

661
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:05,368
[guard] Open up in the name of the King!

662
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:09,064
Lift the spell. Let him remember.

663
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,833
Bibbidi-bobbidi...!

664
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,433
Ooh!

665
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,674
No!

666
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,841
- What's going on?
- My apologies.

667
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,908
It's a problem with my maid.

668
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,420
- It's under control.
- Are you OK?

669
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:27,548
- This servant girl is a thief.
- I am not a thief.

670
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:31,083
You're under a spell. That's why
you don't remember me. Please!

671
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,254
Just listen!

672
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,903
[groans] Let go!

673
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:45,135
[tsking] Poor child.
Obviously out of her mind.

674
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:46,870
I hope she'll be alright.

675
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,936
She seemed, you know,
nice when I met her.

676
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:52,539
Well, maybe a little confused, but,

677
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,743
still there's something about her...

678
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:58,118
Oh, don't trouble yourself,
Your Highness.

679
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:02,659
I'll see to it, personally,
that she gets all the help she needs.

680
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:06,789
Nice try, but we won! [cackles]

681
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:09,298
You won? What do you mean?

682
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:13,370
Uh... Well...

683
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:14,904
...nothing.

684
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,570
I... um...

685
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,803
You'll see she's taken care of?

686
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:23,210
Personally, Your Highness.

687
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:28,851
Put her on the next ship
leaving the kingdom.

688
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:31,285
I want her banished forever.

689
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:32,822
Mmm.

690
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:35,283
And you...

691
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,850
Keep your mouth shut or you're next.

692
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:42,731
[chuckling] Quite fetching.

693
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,892
- Ouch!
- [door opens]

694
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:45,959
Careful with those pins down there.

695
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:49,062
- [door shuts]
- Dad, something strange is going on.

696
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:52,802
I'll say.
My son is finally getting married.

697
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:55,038
No. No, I mean something's wrong.

698
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:59,446
Oh, nonsense, my boy. You wanted
the girl who fit the glass slipper.

699
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,415
- Yes, but...
- Now you've got her.

700
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:02,817
Hey.

701
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:04,582
That's what I'm worried about.

702
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,850
[whistling] Psst! Hey, Princey! Prince!

703
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:09,688
- Over here!
- Princey!

704
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,557
Psst! Psst!

705
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:14,655
- Me?
- Yes, you. Let's go.

706
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:21,703
OK, first birds, now mice.

707
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:23,330
[Gus] Come on!

708
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:39,750
Hello?

709
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:47,656
Hello? Uh... little mice?

710
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:53,832
Well, it's official. I've lost my mind.

711
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:57,931
First I was hijacked by birds,
and now I'm talking to imaginary mice.

712
00:42:58,042 --> 00:42:59,373
[birds chirp]

713
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:03,344
[whistling]
Hey, Prince Prince! Down here!

714
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,779
OK.

715
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:08,276
Maybe not so imaginary.

716
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:11,719
Stepmother got a magic wand,
put spell on you. Fooled everyone.

717
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,654
...came to the palace to marry you!

718
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:16,818
Wait, hold on. Hold on.
I think I understand.

719
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:19,853
Actually, I got nothing.

720
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:24,295
Duh... What should we gonna do?

721
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:25,891
Ahh!

722
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,930
[music plays]

723
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:33,203
# <i>You were dancing</i>
<i>with a very pretty girl</i>

724
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,245
- # <i>Pretty girl</i>
- # <i>At midnight she ran off</i>

725
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:37,143
- # <i>In such a whirl</i>
- # <i>Such a whirl</i>

726
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:40,012
# <i>Her name was Cinderelly</i>
<i>She's the servant girl you met</i>

727
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:41,676
# <i>She's the one you want to marry</i>

728
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:43,276
# <i>Don't forget! Don't forget!</i>

729

- # <i>At the ball, at the ball</i>

730
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:49,086
# <i>Cinderelly was the maiden at the ball</i>

731
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:51,457
No, I danced with Anastasia at the ball.

732
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:55,965
No, no. Princey only think that
because of Cinderelly's stepmother.

733
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:57,500
Yeah, mean old lady.

734
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:00,462
# <i>With a magic wand</i>
<i>she cast a wicked spell</i>

735
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:01,526
# <i>Wicked spell</i>

736
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:03,630
# <i>Which is why Princey</i>
<i>isn't feeling well</i>

737
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:05,800
- # <i>Not well</i>
- # <i>You've forgotten Cinderelly</i>

738
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:07,673
# <i>And the dance you shared last night</i>

739
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:10,145
# <i>But we know it's not too late</i>
<i>to set things right</i>

740
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:12,444
# <i>'Cause at the ball!</i>
<i>At the ball! At the ball!</i>

741
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:13,505
# <i>Yeah, at the ball</i>

742
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:15,814
# <i>Cinderelly was the maiden at the ball</i>

743
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:17,183
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Wait!

744
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:19,518
You're telling me
I'm under a magic spell?

745
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,581
And here's the worst part.

746
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,059
# <i>When Cinderelly</i>
<i>tried her best to take a stand</i>

747
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:25,117
# <i>Take a stand</i>

748
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:28,187
# <i>Mean old lady had her</i>
<i>banished from the land...</i>

749
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:30,256
[bawling]

750
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:33,335
Gus Gus!

751
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:34,462
Sorry.

752
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:38,337
# <i>Cinderelly's on a ship</i>

756
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:47,174
- # <i>Cinderelly won your heart</i>
- # <i>Now magic's keeping you apart</i>

757
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:50,687
- # <i>And she'll soon be gone forever</i>
- # <i>Unless you can recall</i>

758
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:55,851
# <i>That Cinderelly</i>

759

# <i>At the ball!</i> #

760
00:44:57,394 --> 00:44:59,191
Magic?

761
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:02,960
Magic made me think
Anastasia was the girl at the ball?

762
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:06,869
That would explain everything.

763
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:08,564
Yeah! [whistles]

764
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:20,982
What? The servant girl?

765
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:24,748
This Cinderelly? This belongs to her?

766
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:27,382
- Yeah! Yeah!
- I have to find her.

767
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:30,393
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

768
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:35,126
- One more time.
- Duh, yeah.

769
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:37,099
# <i>At the ball! At the ball!</i>

770
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:39,158
# <i>We showed ol' Princey after all</i>

00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:43,070

00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,632
# <i>At the ball!</i>

773

# <i>Cha!</i> #

774
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:51,674
- [door opening]
- Oh... thanks.

775
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,944
And loved the song.

776
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:56,508
- Go! Go! Go, Princey! Shoo! Shoo!
- Go! Go!

777
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,645
[both sigh]

778
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,246
I have to go.

779
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:03,418
Go? But you're about to be married.

780
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:06,956
But the talking mice
say she's the wrong girl.

781
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:09,624
Son, wait!

782
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:14,129
Son! Talking mice? Son?

783
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:15,228
Whoo-hoo!

784
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:17,705
- And two bluebirds.
- Talking bluebirds?

785
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:22,277
No, the bluebirds
weren't talking. Look, Dad...

786
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:23,870
This is ridiculous.

787
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,472
You agreed to marry
the girl in the glass slipper.

788
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,576
- I was completely with you on that one.
- And I will.

789
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:31,951
- Huh?
- Just as soon as I find her.

790
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:36,550
[sputtering] I forbid you to take
another step down these stairs!

791
00:46:38,728 --> 00:46:39,752
OK.

792
00:46:41,564 --> 00:46:44,294
[gasps] Son! Come back!

793
00:46:44,367 --> 00:46:47,302
We'll find you a doctor.
We'll have you leeched.

794
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:49,361
[whistles]

795
00:46:50,906 --> 00:46:53,238
We've got to get...!

00:46:53,309 --> 00:46:57,075
Guards! [howling]

797
00:46:57,146 --> 00:46:58,670
- [King] Aye!
- [all moan]

798
00:46:58,748 --> 00:47:01,615
The servant girl. Where is she?

799
00:47:01,684 --> 00:47:04,676
Guards! He's gone completely mad!

800
00:47:04,754 --> 00:47:06,551
- Your Majesty!
- Stop my son.

801
00:47:06,622 --> 00:47:08,647
Your blood pressure!

802
00:47:08,724 --> 00:47:10,783
- Stop! Stop!
- [whinnies]

803
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,225
Dad, trust me.

804
00:47:12,294 --> 00:47:15,422
Son! I do trust you.

805
00:47:15,498 --> 00:47:18,092
It's the talking mice I'm worried about.

806
00:47:18,167 --> 00:47:19,759
[both scoff]

807
00:47:19,835 --> 00:47:21,803
Hiyah!

808
00:47:21,871 --> 00:47:22,860
Son!

809
00:47:22,938 --> 00:47:25,338
Close the gates! Close the gates!

[groaning]

811
00:47:33,182 --> 00:47:35,707
It'll be fine. Don't look up.

812
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:37,984
Hiyah! Hiyah!

813
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:43,190
Good boy.

814
00:47:45,094 --> 00:47:47,528
- Yeah!
- Go get her, Princey!

815
00:47:50,066 --> 00:47:52,933
I'll send the troops after him
at once, Your Majesty.

816
00:47:53,002 --> 00:47:55,061
No, let him go.

817
00:47:55,137 --> 00:47:57,332
But... but, Your Majesty, the wedding.

818
00:47:57,406 --> 00:47:59,067
Let him go.

819
00:48:06,882 --> 00:48:09,316
[seagulls squawking]

820
00:48:17,259 --> 00:48:19,090
[guard] Time to go.

821
00:48:28,938 --> 00:48:31,372

# <i>That my life could be</i>

824
00:48:58,834 --> 00:49:01,234
# <i>Like a fairy-tale</i>

825
00:49:01,303 --> 00:49:05,069
# <i>A perfect fantasy</i>

826
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:14,042
# <i>But it was nothing more</i>

827
00:49:15,151 --> 00:49:17,779
# <i>Than a dream</i> #

828
00:49:17,853 --> 00:49:20,549
[man] Loose the mainsail!

829
00:49:40,476 --> 00:49:41,807
Hiyah!

Remember me?

Will you marry me, Cinderelly?

838
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:27,709
Yes, but... [giggling] actually,

839
00:51:27,783 --> 00:51:29,580
it's Cinderella.

840
00:51:29,652 --> 00:51:32,416
- [chuckles] Cinderella!
- [laughing]

841
00:51:32,588 --> 00:51:35,113
- It's not over yet!
- What?

842
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:38,057
He thinks he can ruin my plans.

843
00:51:38,127 --> 00:51:39,560
I think not.

844
00:51:39,628 --> 00:51:40,617
Who?

845
00:51:40,696 --> 00:51:43,824
The Prince. He's gone after Cinderella.

846
00:51:43,899 --> 00:51:47,562
- But I thought he loved me.
- [Drizella gasps] Mother!

[King] Guards! Guards!

848
00:52:07,323 --> 00:52:09,416
It's no use. The magic didn't work.

849
00:52:09,491 --> 00:52:13,120
- It wasn't as powerful as their...
- You want the Prince to love you?

850
00:52:13,195 --> 00:52:14,219
[guard] Open up!

851
00:52:14,296 --> 00:52:15,923
Well, yes. Yes, of course I do.

852
00:52:15,998 --> 00:52:17,898
- More than anything.
- [men pounding]

Open up in the name of the King!

Huh?

856
00:52:27,376 --> 00:52:28,968
Hmm.

857
00:52:29,044 --> 00:52:32,639
Using magic on my son. The nerve.

858
00:52:32,715 --> 00:52:36,276
Your Majesty, we've gone over
every inch of the castle.

859
00:52:36,352 --> 00:52:37,842
It appears they have fled.

860
00:52:38,754 --> 00:52:41,154
Then search my entire kingdom!

861
00:52:41,223 --> 00:52:45,284
I want them found and arrested,
immediately!

862
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:49,921
Keep in mind that I'm an old man

863
00:52:49,998 --> 00:52:52,967
and my heart can only take so much.

864
00:52:53,035 --> 00:52:55,333
Please, please, please,

865
00:52:55,404 --> 00:52:59,170
tell me that this is the girl
you intend to marry.

866
00:53:00,943 --> 00:53:05,710
All the stars are shining brighter,
Dad, just like you said.

867
00:53:05,781 --> 00:53:07,510
Then what are we waiting for?!

868
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:12,282
[laughing] Fetch the florist!
Bake an even bigger cake.

869
00:53:12,354 --> 00:53:15,221
The wedding is on tonight!

870
00:53:17,693 --> 00:53:21,629
[Gus] Duh, no. This a way?

871
00:53:21,697 --> 00:53:23,631
[Jaq] Uh, uh, uh.

872
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:25,633
No, no, no, no... thatta way.

873
00:53:25,701 --> 00:53:26,861
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

874
00:53:27,636 --> 00:53:28,898
Yes.

875
00:53:28,971 --> 00:53:30,199
[Gus laughs]

876
00:53:30,272 --> 00:53:31,967
Thank you.

877
00:53:33,208 --> 00:53:35,506
[Stepmother]
How lovely you look, my dear.

878
00:53:35,577 --> 00:53:36,908
Stepmother?

879
00:53:39,381 --> 00:53:41,406
- [Gus] Duh.
