00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:56,646
Oh, for Christ's sake!

171
00:15:56,807 --> 00:15:59,765
- No cigarettes.
- All right, then - please.

172
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:03,203
Please...you bastard.

173
00:16:03,407 --> 00:16:09,164
Doctor say if something wrong here
and you bloody smoking cigarettes,

174
00:16:09,327 --> 00:16:12,080
there's something wrong here as well.

175
00:16:12,247 --> 00:16:16,718
- No cigarette.
- That's you heart patients, nig-nog!

176
00:16:16,927 --> 00:16:20,237
I'm skin, Ali. Skin.
How many more times?

177
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:24,281
I must stay in bed.

178
00:16:24,447 --> 00:16:28,486
Doctor say, ''Stay in bed, nig-nog!''

179
00:16:28,647 --> 00:16:30,638
(LAUGHS)

180
00:16:33,007 --> 00:16:36,079
He said that? The doctor said that?

181
00:16:37,327 --> 00:16:41,957
Ah, I've seen you padding about
half the night, you sly old sod.

182
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:47,002
- Talking to Allah or somebody.
- Oh, no. Bloody God, no.

183
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:51,445
Look, Ali, don't be a hypocrite.
I'm dying for a cigarette.

184
00:16:51,607 --> 00:16:54,075
Love your little brown chops.

185
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:57,922
OK, OK. Bloody dog, me.

186
00:17:02,727 --> 00:17:06,436
They keep putting them on my locker.
''Tidying my trolley.''

187
00:17:06,607 --> 00:17:08,598
All morons with a mania for order

188
00:17:08,767 --> 00:17:11,884
put everything you want
where you can't get it.

189
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:16,723
Do you know how many ''O'' levels
you have to fail to be a nurse?

190
00:17:16,887 --> 00:17:19,447
Blessings on your head, old son.

191
00:17:20,927 --> 00:17:23,441
No bloody flame.

192
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:27,156
Conviction. Do it with conviction!

193
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,638
Oh, my God.

194
00:17:29,807 --> 00:17:33,561
(LAUGHS) Turn it down!
The wheel! The little wheel, Ali.

195
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:35,886
Good.

196
00:17:36,047 --> 00:17:39,039
I could see the headlines -
''Another Asian Burnt to Death.''

197
00:17:42,407 --> 00:17:45,285
No. That wouldn't
make the headlines any more.

198
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:49,520
Not now the National Front
are investing in tandoori ovens.

199
00:17:54,327 --> 00:17:58,684
- Good?
- Good? It's bloody marvellous!

200
00:17:58,847 --> 00:18:01,998
All my hopes and desires
and fondest aspirations

201
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:06,046
have finally been reduced
to their true dimensions, my old son.

202
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,641
Yes. Your lungs.

203
00:18:08,807 --> 00:18:11,446
Look at that blue smoke, Ali.

204
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:14,075
See the way it coils and drifts...

205
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:18,527
just like every human hope.

206
00:18:18,687 --> 00:18:21,042
Yes, yes. Very bloody wise.

207
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:26,082
I used to think that all I wanted was
the good opinion of honourable men

208
00:18:26,247 --> 00:18:29,637
and the ungrudging love
of beautiful women.

209
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:33,117
Now I know that all I really want
is a cigarette.

210
00:18:33,287 --> 00:18:37,519
- Just one more cigarette, Ali.
- Poison. It's poison.

211
00:18:37,687 --> 00:18:40,997
One thing about this place,
it strips away the unimportant stuff,

212
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:45,604
like skin, like love, like loyalty,
like passion and belief...

213
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:47,758
Oh!

214
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:52,235
Oi! I know I'm boring,
but surely not that much!

215
00:18:57,487 --> 00:19:03,164
Were you out of bed? Excuse me.
I said, were you out of bed?

216
00:19:03,327 --> 00:19:07,115
- No, Doctor Finlay, sir. No.
- Yes, you jolly well were!

217
00:19:07,287 --> 00:19:10,723
- What is the point of my...?
- It's my fault.

218
00:19:10,927 --> 00:19:13,600
- Oh?
- I asked him to get me a cigarette.

219
00:19:13,807 --> 00:19:19,359
You shouldn't. And he shouldn't.
You're taking advantage of him.

220
00:19:19,527 --> 00:19:24,476
- In any case, you shouldn't smoke.
- You're not MY doctor. Thank God.

221
00:19:25,407 --> 00:19:29,798
Whether I am or not, don't encourage
this man to get out of bed.

222
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:31,958
- You're being selfish.
- Listen...

223
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:35,358
- You're putting his health at risk.
- Look here...

224
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:40,243
- If he dies, you'll be responsible.
- It'll be one less, then, won't it?

225
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:44,120
- What are you talking about?
- Immigrants, sunshine.

226
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:53,083
- Are you having trouble with him?
- Yes, sir. I am, Doctor. Please.

227
00:19:53,247 --> 00:19:56,045
Has he been making offensive remarks
about your origins?

228
00:19:56,247 --> 00:19:59,796
- Sorry. Origins, please?
- Your, er...race or...?

229
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:03,439
- Sorry. Race, please?
- Yes. Your race.

230
00:20:03,607 --> 00:20:06,679
Go on. Tell him, you brown bugger!

231
00:20:06,887 --> 00:20:08,559
(BOTH LAUGH)

232
00:20:09,247 --> 00:20:11,238
(PAGER BEEPS)

233
00:20:17,127 --> 00:20:22,360
Jumped up little snot. Go on.
You get out of bed, Ali, old pal.

234
00:20:22,527 --> 00:20:25,724
- No, no.
- Well, why not? What's the point?

235
00:20:25,887 --> 00:20:28,799
Why endure one moment more
than you have to?

236
00:20:28,967 --> 00:20:31,845
Go on, get of bed. Jump up and down.

237
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:36,239
Then hold a pillow over my face,
and we'll go together. Come on.

238
00:20:44,487 --> 00:20:48,400
At first, comma,

239
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:54,722
the only sound is the slap hyphen
slap of the water

240
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:56,878
against the boat, comma,

241
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:01,245
which has its engine switched off.
Double space.

242
00:21:01,407 --> 00:21:06,435
The other, comma, natural noises
increase

243
00:21:06,607 --> 00:21:11,635
as the naked, drowned body
of a beautiful woman is slowly pulled...

244
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,525
What are you talking about,
Mr Marlow?

245
00:21:17,247 --> 00:21:21,320
I had on my best pyjamas,
the ones with blue forget-me-nots.

246
00:21:21,487 --> 00:21:25,799
I was all dressed up.
A million dollars was about to call.

247
00:21:25,967 --> 00:21:29,277
- I was ready for it.
- High temperature again, have we?

248
00:21:29,447 --> 00:21:31,438
When she moved her lips like that,

249
00:21:31,607 --> 00:21:36,044
I felt like a tulip when
the first raindrop smacked into it.

250
00:21:36,207 --> 00:21:41,804
I decided to open up.
Boy, was I green...or do I mean wet?

251
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,357
- Oh, I see.
- Your eyes are not for seeing,

252
00:21:45,527 --> 00:21:47,518
they're for being looked at.

253
00:21:47,687 --> 00:21:51,680
We're in a good mood.
We're actually talking today.

254
00:21:51,847 --> 00:21:53,963
What do you mean?

255
00:21:54,127 --> 00:22:00,236
According to the report, you didn't say
one word yesterday. Not for the first time.

256
00:22:00,447 --> 00:22:02,244
- Me?
- Yes, you.

257
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:05,120
They put that sort of thing
on report?

258
00:22:05,327 --> 00:22:08,683
Oh, yes. Everything.

259
00:22:08,847 --> 00:22:11,315
- Is that why they...?
- Go on, ask.

260
00:22:11,487 --> 00:22:14,923
Is that why they think
I'm a bit touched? Loopy?

261
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:18,199
- No!
- What, then?

262
00:22:18,367 --> 00:22:21,200
- Depressed.
- Tranquillisers.

263
00:22:21,367 --> 00:22:23,403
No, worse - those antidepressants.

264
00:22:23,567 --> 00:22:27,719
Brain-drainers. Is that why
they try to make me swallow them?

265
00:22:27,887 --> 00:22:31,084
- If they help people...
- I'm not taking them!

266
00:22:31,247 --> 00:22:35,160
I've got thinking to do. If I don't
think, I'll never get out. I'll...

267
00:22:37,087 --> 00:22:40,523
- Are you going to grease me?
- If you're ready.

268
00:22:41,647 --> 00:22:44,081
Ready as a back-axle.

269
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:49,080
- Nurse? Nurse?
- What is it, Mr Hall?

270
00:22:49,287 --> 00:22:51,847
Could you spare a moment,
Nurse, here?

271
00:22:52,047 --> 00:22:55,323
- No. Tell me.
- Nurse, please.

272
00:22:55,487 --> 00:22:57,637
(WHISPERS)
Could you come here, please?

273
00:23:01,207 --> 00:23:05,246
You're going to wear us out,
aren't you?

274
00:23:05,407 --> 00:23:07,398
Now, what is it?

275
00:23:09,967 --> 00:23:14,882
Beg pardon, my dear. I need
the, er...you know...very badly.

276
00:23:15,047 --> 00:23:19,723
- The...contraption. You know.
- Contraption? What contraption?

277
00:23:19,887 --> 00:23:21,878
Tuppence. I want to spend tuppence.

278
00:23:22,087 --> 00:23:26,285
Reginald, would you get a bedpan
for Mr Hall and close his curtains?

279
00:23:28,287 --> 00:23:31,006
Got the shits again, Pop?

280
00:23:39,927 --> 00:23:45,081
Bit like being in a tent in here,
isn't it, with the curtains shut?

281
00:23:45,247 --> 00:23:47,920
Yeah. And the desert all around.

282
00:23:49,727 --> 00:23:54,323
- Shall I do the top or bottom first?
- I don't mind.

283
00:23:54,527 --> 00:23:57,564
- Still can't get your pyjamas off?
- No.

284
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:01,197
All right.
I'll start down below first.

285
00:24:05,207 --> 00:24:08,005
Right, let's get these trousers off.

286
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:19,476
I'll try not to hurt. Up you come.

287
00:24:20,847 --> 00:24:22,838
(GRUNTS)

288
00:24:31,527 --> 00:24:34,917
- Thanks.
- All right.

289
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:39,886
Relax. We can start now.

00:25:00,327 --> 00:25:02,318
I'll be as gentle as I can.

294
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:13,805
<i>Think of something very, very boring.</i>

295
00:25:13,967 --> 00:25:16,640
<i>A speech... A speech by Ted Heath.</i>

296
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:19,560
<i>A sentence, a long sentence,</i>

- Oh, I'm sorry. Is that too hard?
- Too hard? Yes.

I mean, genuinely artistic.

- Top-hole.
- And it's right, too.

- What a girl should be told.
- I'm sorry?

Well, a guy can get excited,
can't he?

326
00:27:16,687 --> 00:27:19,281
- You're telling me.
- It's all fizz.

- You're not eating, Amanda.

No. Well, one can only consume

Where do they get this meat?
Real steak.

00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:40,046
Ask no questions, I'll tell no lies.

332
00:27:40,207 --> 00:27:42,675
Still, is it legal? Or is it horse?

333
00:27:45,487 --> 00:27:48,160
- What's up, sugar?
- I need the gents.

334
00:27:48,327 --> 00:27:51,444
- Oh, what? Now?
- She's nearly done.

335
00:27:51,647 --> 00:27:55,686
- And I've heard the song.
- Know where it is, sugar?

336
00:27:55,887 --> 00:27:57,878
I'll find it...toots.

339
00:28:12,287 --> 00:28:15,882
I have to lift your penis now
to grease around it.

340
00:28:32,487 --> 00:28:36,241
(MARLOW) I'm sorry, Nurse.
I do beg your pardon.

341
00:28:36,447 --> 00:28:40,565
It's the one part of me
that still sort of functions.

342
00:28:40,727 --> 00:28:46,006
- I do beg your pardon.
- It's all right. I understand.

343
00:28:46,207 --> 00:28:52,362
- It has a will of its own.
- We don't need to talk about it.

344
00:28:53,767 --> 00:28:55,564
No.

345
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:07,355
- How long have you had this?
- Twenty, thirty years.

346
00:29:07,527 --> 00:29:12,157
- As bad as this?
- No. It's at its peak now, almost.

347
00:29:12,327 --> 00:29:15,637
I'm losing control
of my body temperature.

348
00:29:15,807 --> 00:29:19,402
- I keep going over the top.
- Yes.

349
00:29:19,567 --> 00:29:23,276
I think... I think I tend
to hallucinate a bit.

350
00:29:23,447 --> 00:29:25,438
That happens.

351
00:29:25,607 --> 00:29:29,805
I thought there was a cat in the bed
this morning - in it, not on it -

352
00:29:29,967 --> 00:29:33,801
meticulously chewing off my toes,
one by one.

353
00:29:35,287 --> 00:29:36,686
(GASPS)

354
00:29:36,847 --> 00:29:39,919
I'm trying not to hurt you.

355
00:29:40,087 --> 00:29:46,640
Sometimes these hallucinations
are better than the real thing.

356
00:29:46,807 --> 00:29:52,564
People can sing in them or dance.
I don't mind. I like pictures.

357
00:29:55,687 --> 00:29:58,485
You write detective stories,
don't you?

358
00:29:58,647 --> 00:30:01,241
- Who told you that?
- Oh, a little bird.

359
00:30:01,447 --> 00:30:04,519
Well, the little bird is wrong.
I used to.

360
00:30:04,727 --> 00:30:06,718
- Hey.
- Got to work.

361
00:30:06,927 --> 00:30:09,441
- Sorry.
- I've got to work.

362
00:30:09,647 --> 00:30:13,162
A man's got to work.
Somehow, I've got to work.

363
00:30:13,327 --> 00:30:14,999
Hey, now...

364
00:30:15,207 --> 00:30:18,085
(CHUCKLES) You'd think my mother
would have had more sense

365
00:30:18,247 --> 00:30:21,717
than to call me Philip
with a name like Marlow.

366
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:26,722
Philip Marlow. It hasn't got an ''E''
on the end, but it sounds the same.

367
00:30:26,927 --> 00:30:30,761
- Same as what?
- Philip Marlowe.

368
00:30:30,927 --> 00:30:33,202
You've heard of him surely?

369
00:30:33,367 --> 00:30:35,881
Christ Almighty.

370
00:30:36,047 --> 00:30:40,245
What else could I have done
except write detective stories?

371
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:44,244
She should have
called me Christopher.

372
00:30:45,287 --> 00:30:48,279
I don't suppose
you've heard of him either.

373
00:30:59,207 --> 00:31:01,198
This way?

374
00:31:02,167 --> 00:31:04,158
Thank you.

375
00:31:47,727 --> 00:31:51,515
I'm so sorry, ladies.
Looking for the gents.

Find it all right?

00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:06,196
- Er, yes. I found it all right.
- What's up, sugar?

386
00:34:07,207 --> 00:34:10,677
It's hot in here. Baking.

387
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:16,319
- I feel as if I'm burning up.
- God. You're dripping.

388
00:34:17,527 --> 00:34:20,325
That shows
a passionate nature, sugar.

389
00:34:20,487 --> 00:34:22,842
And what about you?

390
00:34:23,007 --> 00:34:25,475
You seem very cool to me.

391
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:27,956
Only when I'm upright.

392
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:37,158
Not another bottle?!

393
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:43,197
You have to keep coughing up if you
want my company. Ain't I worth it?

394
00:34:43,367 --> 00:34:47,360
- No need to drink it, though.
- What? At P2 1O/- a bottle?

395
00:34:47,527 --> 00:34:50,883
- Mark... It is Mark?
- As in the second gospel.

- Never mind.

- Oh.

Thank you.

401
00:35:16,487 --> 00:35:21,436
Well, let's hope I get
something back for all this.

402
00:35:21,607 --> 00:35:25,122
- That all depends, don't it?
- On what?

403
00:35:27,607 --> 00:35:29,882
On what you mean.

404
00:35:34,367 --> 00:35:38,406

Good morning to you. Let me see.
You are Mr...?

414
00:36:57,047 --> 00:37:00,835
- Marlow, sir.
- Of course. How are you feeling?

415
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:05,957
- Er... Not very...
- Very inflamed. Extensive lesions.

416
00:37:06,127 --> 00:37:08,641
- Temperature still too high.
- Marked arthrosis.

417
00:37:08,807 --> 00:37:10,798
Difficult. Difficult.

418
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:13,481
How long have you had
this psoriatic arthropathy?

419
00:37:13,647 --> 00:37:17,242
- Um, twenty....
- Twenty-five years.

420
00:37:17,407 --> 00:37:19,523
How much movement in the joints?

421
00:37:19,687 --> 00:37:23,885
He's had hydrocortisone injections
in all major joints, including toes.

422
00:37:24,087 --> 00:37:25,679
Tootsie-wootsies, eh?

423
00:37:25,847 --> 00:37:29,556
Prednisone and then Prednisolone
in bursts, then for longer periods,

424
00:37:29,727 --> 00:37:34,005
but with Betnovate and Dermovate
under total occlusive dressings.

425
00:37:34,727 --> 00:37:36,718
Well, you can see the damage.

426
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:41,199
Latterly, with such occlusions,
one might have to describe it as...

427
00:37:41,367 --> 00:37:43,597
Iatrogenic.

428
00:37:43,807 --> 00:37:46,799
Hmm... History?

429
00:37:47,207 --> 00:37:50,836
Um, prior to this,
pretty usual sequence of events.

430
00:37:51,007 --> 00:37:53,157
Precise. Be precise!

431
00:37:53,327 --> 00:37:56,763
Initially, coal tar,
but then injections -

432
00:37:56,927 --> 00:37:59,885
Butazolidin, Indomethacin,
not successful -

433
00:38:00,047 --> 00:38:03,642
The short courses, Prednisone,
Prednisolone, lengthening.

434
00:38:03,847 --> 00:38:07,362
Then Methotrexate,
after a positive liver biopsy...

435
00:38:07,527 --> 00:38:09,518
- Vomiting?
- Vomiting.

436
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:13,362
- Finally withdrawn.
- Ten years of occlusive dressings,

437
00:38:13,527 --> 00:38:15,757
corticosteroid ointments each night.

438
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:18,282
- Razoxane.
- Also cytotoxic.

439
00:38:18,647 --> 00:38:23,198
Which induced neutropenia.
Wart-like lesions removed. Withdrawn.

440
00:38:26,687 --> 00:38:28,484
Hmm...

441
00:38:30,047 --> 00:38:35,167
I've seen cases as bad as this
in Baltimore. Not many.

442
00:38:35,327 --> 00:38:37,716
Will you try one of the retinoids?

443
00:38:39,247 --> 00:38:40,760
Mmm...

444
00:38:40,927 --> 00:38:43,805
- I would have said so.
- Worth a try.

445
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:47,164
- Hmm...
- Er... Excuse me.

446
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:54,163
This hyperventilation. Any odd
thoughts in the brain box, old chap?

447
00:38:54,327 --> 00:38:58,445
On Tuesday, he insisted
a cat was chewing at his feet.

448
00:38:58,607 --> 00:39:01,883
- Isn't that so?
- Yes. Attacking his toes.

449
00:39:02,087 --> 00:39:04,123
Tootsie-wootsies, hmm?

450
00:39:04,287 --> 00:39:09,236
- We don't allow cats in the ward.
- Quite so. Quite so.

451
00:39:09,407 --> 00:39:14,561
Well, now. There's one other drug
which might be some help, Mr, er...

452
00:39:14,767 --> 00:39:16,758
- Marlow.
- How do you feel

453
00:39:16,927 --> 00:39:20,806
about trying one
of the new retinoids, hmm?

454
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:25,642
Do you understand the question?

455
00:39:25,847 --> 00:39:28,441
Er, no. I don't think so.

456
00:39:28,647 --> 00:39:31,923
Would you like to try
one of the new...

457
00:39:32,127 --> 00:39:35,164
I don't understand
because I've regressed

458
00:39:35,327 --> 00:39:38,763
into a helpless and pathetic
condition of total dependency

459
00:39:38,927 --> 00:39:41,646
of a kind normally associated
with infancy.

460
00:39:41,847 --> 00:39:46,159
- What's he say?
- The last time I experienced this

461
00:39:46,327 --> 00:39:51,321
was in my bloody pram, being drooled
over by slobbering cretins...

462
00:39:51,527 --> 00:39:55,315
- Mr Marlow!
- ..who'd escaped from the loony bin.

they were doctors and nurses!

Tell me, what do you do
for a living, Mr, er...?

by way of earning a crust?

- Oh. I didn't realise.

- Detective stories.
- Oh. How interesting.

00:40:25,327 --> 00:40:29,957
Will you listen to me, please?
Will you please, please, listen to me?

Well, what is it?

472
00:40:32,967 --> 00:40:37,199
I can't talk to you
lying flat out like this.

You're having a tough time.

664
00:54:33,447 --> 00:54:36,757
Look, I'm impressed by your
astonishing powers of deduction,

665
00:54:36,927 --> 00:54:39,885
which surpass even those
of the great Holmes himself...

666
00:54:40,047 --> 00:54:42,800
- Now, now.
- ..but I am trying to work.

667
00:54:42,967 --> 00:54:47,677
- Work?
- Do you think writing isn't work?

668
00:54:47,847 --> 00:54:51,965
- No. Of course not.
- Or do you labour under the delusion

669
00:54:52,127 --> 00:54:56,040
that it consists solely and entirely
of putting words on a page

670
00:54:56,207 --> 00:54:58,562
without thought, without planning...

671
00:54:58,727 --> 00:55:01,878
as if I were a Sunday Times
journalist.

672
00:55:02,047 --> 00:55:05,198
- Ah, I see what you mean.
- Do you, now?

673
00:55:05,407 --> 00:55:07,398
It must be hellishly ticklish

674
00:55:07,567 --> 00:55:10,639
to work out a plot
in a detective story.

675
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:14,641
I suppose you have to scatter clues
all over the place.

676
00:55:14,807 --> 00:55:18,800
- Yeah. Like throwing grit to hens.
- I'd like to read one of your...

677
00:55:19,007 --> 00:55:22,477
Out of print, all of them.
And why not?

678
00:55:22,647 --> 00:55:25,207
The hens wouldn't lay,
the cock wouldn't crow.

679
00:55:26,247 --> 00:55:30,206
- I see.
- For Christ's sake.

680
00:55:30,367 --> 00:55:32,358
For Christ's sake!

681
00:55:36,807 --> 00:55:43,963
Mr Marlow, do you think you have
the right attitude towards your illness?

682
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:49,520
Do you? I mean, that's the really
interesting question. Your attitude.

683
00:55:49,687 --> 00:55:51,962
Partly, yes.
But you should also consider...

684
00:55:52,127 --> 00:55:56,006
- Will I ever be free of it?
- Well, that's something...

685
00:55:56,207 --> 00:55:58,801
Will I ever be able to move properly?

686
00:55:59,007 --> 00:56:03,398
Will I ever be able
to hold a pen again? Tell me that.

687
00:56:03,567 --> 00:56:07,924
Come on. Never mind the blather.
I can get that from a doctor, Doctor.

688
00:56:08,967 --> 00:56:13,006
You ask as though someone else
was responsible for your condition,

689
00:56:13,167 --> 00:56:18,878
but no one is, or at least,
in the unlikely event that anyone is,

690
00:56:19,047 --> 00:56:22,960
then that someone cannot be
anyone other than yourself, can it?

691
00:56:23,167 --> 00:56:28,366
Oh, what are you talking about?
It's not your job to be cryptic.

692
00:56:28,567 --> 00:56:32,082
I have occasionally seen patients
who are just as bad,

693
00:56:32,247 --> 00:56:34,238
sometimes worse than you are,

694
00:56:34,407 --> 00:56:40,243
but it's fair to say that none of them
reacts with such aggression...

695
00:56:40,407 --> 00:56:44,844
- What do they do? Sing madrigals?
- They don't rail against the world

696
00:56:45,007 --> 00:56:47,965
or behave like they've fallen
into a sewer.

697
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:51,881
Are you trying to say
I should take the tranquillizers?

698
00:56:52,047 --> 00:56:55,835
Or is it a deodorant
you've got in mind?

699
00:56:57,047 --> 00:57:00,357
I think you should take
the tranquillizers for a while.

700
00:57:00,567 --> 00:57:04,162
- No! I won't!
- That's up to you.

701
00:57:04,327 --> 00:57:07,524
No one's going to ram them
down your throat.

702
00:57:08,447 --> 00:57:12,486
But where are you going
to find any equanimity?

703
00:57:12,647 --> 00:57:14,638
What?

704
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:19,403
It's an embarrassing question,
even between husbands and wives,

705
00:57:19,567 --> 00:57:23,196
but what do you believe in?

706
00:57:23,367 --> 00:57:25,835
- Malthusianism.
- Come again?

707
00:57:26,047 --> 00:57:28,242
Malthus, but mandatorily.

708
00:57:28,407 --> 00:57:32,241
Compulsory depopulation
by infanticide, suicide, genocide

709
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:34,398
or whatever other means
suggest themselves.

710
00:57:34,567 --> 00:57:38,082
AIDS. That'll do.
Why should queers be so special?

711
00:57:38,247 --> 00:57:40,715
- I see.
- I also believe in cigarettes,

712
00:57:40,887 --> 00:57:43,003
cholesterol, alcohol,

713
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:47,001
carbon monoxide,
masturbation, the Arts Council,

714
00:57:47,167 --> 00:57:49,761
nuclear weapons, the Daily Telegraph

715
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:52,162
and not properly labelling
fatal poisons,

716
00:57:52,327 --> 00:57:55,763
but above all else,
I believe in the one thing

717
00:57:55,927 --> 00:57:59,920
that can come out
of people's mouths - vomit.

718
00:58:00,447 --> 00:58:02,244
(SIGHS)

719
00:58:04,167 --> 00:58:08,524
I want you to think carefully
about what I'm going to say.

720
00:58:08,687 --> 00:58:11,804
There's a very good man
at the hospital.

721
00:58:11,967 --> 00:58:17,121
Very alert and sympathetic.
I'd like you to talk to him.

722
00:58:17,287 --> 00:58:20,723
What? Alert and what?
What are you talking about?

723
00:58:20,967 --> 00:58:24,357
- Who is he? He'll get struck off.
- Dr Gibbon.

724
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:29,561
Doctor of what?
Skin? Joints? Monkeys?

725
00:58:29,727 --> 00:58:32,241
The decline and fall
of the Roman Empire?

726
00:58:32,407 --> 00:58:35,763
What's he got to be alert
and sympathetic about?

727
00:58:35,927 --> 00:58:40,239
He's a...
Well, he's a psychotherapist.

728
00:58:40,447 --> 00:58:44,486
- Very good man. You'd get on with him.
- Get stuffed!

729
00:58:47,847 --> 00:58:49,838
Y-You are out of order.

730
00:58:50,007 --> 00:58:55,479
- I won't be spoken to in this way.
- Then F-U-C-- off, sir.

731
00:58:55,647 --> 00:58:57,797
We will speak again. Good afternoon.

732
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:59,958
Good afternoon.

733
00:59:01,407 --> 00:59:02,886
Hey.

734
00:59:04,127 --> 00:59:05,640
Hey!

735
00:59:05,807 --> 00:59:07,604
Hey.

736
00:59:08,407 --> 00:59:11,479
What do you want?
How are things in Gloccamora?

737
00:59:11,687 --> 00:59:17,364
- He say when you go?
- Christ Almighty. Where? Handsworth?

738
00:59:17,527 --> 00:59:21,281
Didn't he say when?
When you go out, hey?

739
00:59:21,487 --> 00:59:27,562
We're never getting out. This is
our home on the range, old pal.

740
00:59:27,727 --> 00:59:29,877
Well, the hotplate, anyway.

741
00:59:30,047 --> 00:59:34,325
Don't talk rubbish. We are.

742
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:38,400
We are. Any bloody time now.

743
00:59:39,247 --> 00:59:43,160
Yeah, we will, one day.

744
00:59:43,327 --> 00:59:46,603
Arm-in-arm, together, eh?
Like Alcock and Brown.

745
00:59:50,287 --> 00:59:52,437
You can be Brown.

746
00:59:52,607 --> 00:59:57,237
We're never going to get out
of this bloody place.

747
00:59:57,407 --> 01:00:01,844
- You're right. Never!
- Yes, we are, Ali.

748
01:00:02,007 --> 01:00:05,124
Come on.
We'll break a popadom together.

749
01:00:05,287 --> 01:00:08,643
I promise you that, Ali. I promise.

750
01:00:19,247 --> 01:00:22,205
Hey! Hey!

751
01:00:22,367 --> 01:00:25,404
Christ. What is it now?
Call the Samaritans, would you?

752
01:00:25,567 --> 01:00:28,479
- You want sweet?
- How about sour?

753
01:00:28,647 --> 01:00:31,445
- That's more my line.
- You want sweet?

754
01:00:31,647 --> 01:00:37,961
No, thanks, Ali. My jaws hurt.
Thanks, Ali. Thanks all the same.

755
01:00:38,127 --> 01:00:40,118
Some other time, eh, sweetheart?

756
01:00:40,287 --> 01:00:44,280
You have sweet.
I have a lot of sweets.

757
01:00:44,447 --> 01:00:49,043
You have sweet, I have sweet,
and we say up the arse, eh?

758
01:00:50,687 --> 01:00:52,917
Yeah. Up the arse.

God! Nurse!

766
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,925
Nurse!

767
01:01:20,087 --> 01:01:21,566
Nurse?

768
01:01:25,607 --> 01:01:29,202
Ali? Ali? Call 199.

769
01:01:43,127 --> 01:01:45,118
Hurry!

770
01:01:51,527 --> 01:01:54,360
(SISTER) Plug that in.
Get that headboard off.

771
01:01:55,607 --> 01:01:57,996
I'll take over. Put his arms down.

772
01:02:04,807 --> 01:02:06,798
(DOCTOR) Thank you, Nurse.

773
01:02:11,287 --> 01:02:13,642
Please set up a drip.

774
01:02:21,247 --> 01:02:24,637
(2nd DOCTOR) What's the rhythm?
Give me the paddles.

775
01:02:27,607 --> 01:02:29,723
(DOCTOR) Set it for 2O.

776
01:02:32,367 --> 01:02:34,358
Stand clear, everyone.

777
01:02:36,807 --> 01:02:38,957
Give me 4O.

778
01:02:39,807 --> 01:02:41,843
Stand clear, everyone.

779
01:02:45,727 --> 01:02:48,287
(2nd DOCTOR) Set up a drip.
Give me the adrenalin.

780
01:03:14,287 --> 01:03:16,847
(DOCTOR) One last try.
Stand clear, everyone.

781
01:03:23,407 --> 01:03:26,797
(NURSE)
Fixed and dilated, I'm afraid.

782
01:03:29,007 --> 01:03:33,319
OK. That's it.

783
01:03:33,487 --> 01:03:37,116
- Time, Staff?
- 14.37.

784
01:03:37,287 --> 01:03:40,245
(DOCTOR)
Record that as time of death.

785
01:04:18,527 --> 01:04:22,679
- Oh, you are untidy!
- (MARLOW) Who is? What?

786
01:04:24,087 --> 01:04:26,282
Dropping your sweeties
all over the place.

787
01:04:26,447 --> 01:04:30,326
- Oh, they're not...
- Try and be more careful, shall we?

788
01:04:30,487 --> 01:04:32,478
Yeah, I'm sorry.

789
01:04:34,207 --> 01:04:37,085
- Shall I unwrap one?
- I'd prefer a cigarette.

790
01:04:37,247 --> 01:04:41,035
- I'm not giving you one of those...
- You shouldn't smoke.

791
01:04:41,207 --> 01:04:46,884
- I don't know why they allow it.
- Yes. They might make me ill.

792
01:04:52,727 --> 01:04:55,195
- Have you been greased yet?
- No.

793
01:04:55,367 --> 01:04:58,325
You should have been.
Why tell us now?

794
01:04:58,487 --> 01:05:02,366
Did I say anything? Did I?
Jesus Christ on a bike.

795
01:05:02,527 --> 01:05:07,317
It's all right, Staff.
I'll do it before I go off.

796
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:11,162
It makes you a bit more comfortable,
doesn't it...eventually?

797
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:16,727
I'm... All right. I will
have a sweet now, Nurse, please.

798
01:05:25,007 --> 01:05:26,998
What's the matter?

799
01:05:28,727 --> 01:05:30,126
Nothing.

800
01:05:31,687 --> 01:05:34,520
Do you want something for the pain?

801
01:05:34,687 --> 01:05:38,680
(WHIMPERS) They're very nice,
these sweets, Nurse.

802
01:05:38,847 --> 01:05:42,396
Very nice indeed. (SOBS)
