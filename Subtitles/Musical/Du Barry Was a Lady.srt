1
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:28,410
Back in the 18th century
when romance was in bloom

2
00:02:28,483 --> 00:02:32,681
And Louis XV wasn't just a sofa in a room

3
00:02:32,754 --> 00:02:36,986
A simple little country girl
who knew a thing or two

4
00:02:37,058 --> 00:02:41,995
Got very, very chummy
with His Majesty, King Lou

5
00:02:42,063 --> 00:02:46,227
The people disapproved of her
in no uncertain tone

6
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,794
Still, they'd agree that Madam D
was a power behind the throne

7
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:52,999
Behind her back, they called her names

8
00:02:53,074 --> 00:02:55,133
On that we will not tarry

9
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:58,804
But to her face, with elegant grace

10
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,579
They said Madame Du Barry

11
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:07,018
Madame, Madame

12
00:03:07,088 --> 00:03:10,546
They said Madame

13
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:17,053
Du Barry

14
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:25,132
Perhaps she was
a gorgeous little hussy from Bordeaux

15
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:31,042
But there's one thing
we positively absolutely know

16
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:33,911
Du Barry was a lady

17
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:36,814
No matter what they may say

18
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,647
Du Barry was a lady

19
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,712
The fairest gal of her day

20
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:45,486
She had to pull no strings
for the King's blessing

21
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,052
He fell in love with her French dressing

22
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:53,726
To marry this Du Barry
was every nobleman's goal

23
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:58,602
And put them all together
they'd fill the Hollywood Bowl

24
00:03:58,673 --> 00:04:02,131
l couldn't tell you how, but she got along

25
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:06,738
And if she was no lady
fifty million Frenchmen were wrong

26
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:10,275
Though she started out in squalor

27
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:14,344
And though her past was shady

28
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:18,084
You can bet your bottom dollar

29
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:22,095
She ended up a lady

30
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:25,364
Du Barry

31
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:27,298
Du Barry

32
00:04:27,368 --> 00:04:30,667
Du Barry was a lady

33
00:04:47,622 --> 00:04:50,557
Oh, Rami, isn't she wonderful?

34
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,752
Just another female woman.

35
00:04:52,827 --> 00:04:57,287
Take away her eyes, her nose, her mouth
and her ears and what have you got?

36
00:04:57,365 --> 00:04:59,230
A blank expression.

37
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:03,434
She's wonderful.

38
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:10,366
-You never look at me like that.
-You never look like that.

39
00:05:11,846 --> 00:05:15,304
Louis, if you're not doing anything
after work, l'd like to take you home.

40
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:17,874
No. Not after last night.

41
00:05:17,952 --> 00:05:20,546
Oh, you could never be happy here.

42
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:24,318
Please marry me
and let me take you away from all this.

43
00:05:24,392 --> 00:05:27,520
And after we're married
and settled down in our little love nest,

44
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:31,053
maybe the stork'd come to our house
and bring us a lot of little...

45
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:33,623
Cigars, cigarettes, chewing gum.

46
00:05:40,575 --> 00:05:43,009
Du Barry was a lady

47
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:45,671
Oh, what a lady was she

48
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:51,548
The men still raved about her
the last time l saw Paris

49
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:55,889
With wealthy knights she was chummy...

50
00:05:55,957 --> 00:05:59,620
Please be very careful with this.
lt's kolinsky.

51
00:06:02,063 --> 00:06:03,997
Would you give me a check, please?

52
00:06:04,065 --> 00:06:06,226
That's May Daly.

53
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:09,729
-Who?
-May Daly.

54
00:06:11,706 --> 00:06:13,606
That's May Daly.

55
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:18,443
lt doesn't matter now how she got along

56
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:20,776
lf she was double-dating

57
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,645
Du Barry was okay

58
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:24,810
And if her life was shady

59
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:26,615
Well, who are we to say?

60
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:29,121
But if she was no lady maybe twenty

61
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,384
-Thirty
-Forty

62
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:36,397
Fifty million Frenchmen were wrong

63
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:43,895
Madame, you are about to meet
a handsome man.

64
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:47,031
-Not too young, not too old.
-About my age?

65
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:53,109
l see both of you meeting
in a secluded, moonlit, romantic nightclub.

66
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,580
But l've got to polish up the crystal ball.

67
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:59,211
Have you got a soft, slightly used $5 bill?

68
00:06:59,287 --> 00:07:03,018
-Do you think this will be soft enough?
-lt will have to do.

69
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:06,082
You will meet this man.

70
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,722
He will be wearing a tuxedo,
eyeglasses and some hair.

71
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:13,130
This is the man, your soul mate.

72
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,761
Marry him, madam, and you marry her.
$5, please.

73
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:19,465
That's a good one on you, Swami.
We were married last night.

74
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,907
-Weren't we, Mr. McGeehan?
-McGowan.

75
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:24,968
Oh, yeah. McGowan.

76
00:07:25,046 --> 00:07:28,413
Marry Mr. McQuinn.
He is so charming, so debonair.

77
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:30,416
He reminds me of that well-known actor.

78
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:34,443
You know, the one who makes love
to beautiful girls like Hedy Lamarr.

79
00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:35,989
You know who l mean.

80
00:07:55,109 --> 00:07:57,441
Hedy.

81
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,546
My name is Pepe le Coco.

82
00:08:04,185 --> 00:08:09,248
And l come from the casbah, Hedy,
the casbah.

83
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,655
You know what is the casbah?

84
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:17,459
lt is right next to the delicatessen.

85
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:20,125
Hedy, l love you, l adore you.

86
00:08:20,201 --> 00:08:24,763
l love your visage. l love your face.

87
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:36,073
l love your eyes,
and your lipses and your hair, Hedy.

88
00:08:37,218 --> 00:08:39,743
Let me run through your hair

89
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:42,846
barefoot.

90
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:44,652
Hedy, l love you, l adore you.

91
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:46,590
Look across the sea and what do you see?

92
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,288
Paris and the white way,

93
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:52,491
and the Rue de Montmartre,
and the Champs Élysées.

94
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:03,535
Hedy.

95
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:07,738
And this one thing, this one question,
runs through my mind again and again.

96
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:10,909
And it wants to know this one thing,
this one question, this one thing.

97
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:13,920
And my temples throb,
and my...doesn't know what to say,

98
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:17,480
my throat clenches tight
and my heart beats faster and faster.

99
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:20,026
Faster and faster beats my heart.

100
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:26,132
And it wants to know this one thing,
this one question, this one thing.

101
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:29,361
Will you go with me
to the high school prom?

102
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,866
-Louis, old pal, l'm glad to see you.
-Hello.

103
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:38,844
-Louis, l got bad news for you.
-What?

104
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:41,438
The cook out there just said
you were the tightest guy in the place.

105
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:42,948
But l stuck up for you.

106
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:45,281
l told him you had a heart as big as Texas.

107
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:46,944
-The cook said that?
-Yeah.

108
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:49,649
And he bet me 5 bucks
l couldn't borrow 5 bucks from you.

109
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:52,487
-Oh, he did, did he?
-Yeah. How do you like a guy like that?

110
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,790
Well, wait a minute. When do l get it back?

111
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:56,557
Just as soon as l see the cook.

112
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,224
Oh, now do you think
l'm as dumb as l look?

113
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,734
l'll give it back to you Saturday.
This is the cook's day off.

114
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:04,362
How sure can l be
l'm gonna get it back Saturday?

115
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:05,700
Just as sure as she's alive.

116
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:08,901
Oh, no. l gotta have better proof than that.

117
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:10,671
Look, Louis, l don't want
this dough for myself.

118
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:12,473
l want to spend it on someone.

119
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:14,776
Someone we both admire.

120
00:10:14,849 --> 00:10:16,180
May Daly.

121
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:19,952
-You got a date with May Daly?
-Nobody else.

122
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:24,114
She'll turn you down
like she did last night.

123
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:26,716
May was tired last night.
She went straight home.

124
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:28,421
Oh, she did, huh?

125
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:29,887
Hey, l'll tell you what.

126
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:32,524
lf May goes out with you tonight,
you don't have to return the 5 bucks.

127
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,363
But if she don't, you owe me $10.

128
00:10:34,435 --> 00:10:35,993
Are you kidding?

129
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:39,934
Sucker.

130
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:44,807
You're wrong, Rami. He did lend it to me.

131
00:10:47,348 --> 00:10:49,475
-Fly specks.
-Hey.

132
00:10:51,252 --> 00:10:53,220
That guy's a friend of yours, isn't he?

133
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:58,020
l, Rami, have only one true friend,
Baldor the Omnipotent.

134
00:10:58,092 --> 00:10:59,821
The voice from the beyond.

135
00:10:59,894 --> 00:11:01,919
But l've got to admit,
me and the kid is pretty chummy.

136
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:03,725
Yeah? Well, tell him he's wasting his time.

137
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:05,856
You know who Miss Daly's
going out with tonight?

138
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:08,834
Don't look in that goldfish bowl.
l'll tell you.

139
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:11,635
Him.

140
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:15,698
-Handsome chap, isn't he?
-There's the rest of him out there.

141
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:18,711
-Cigars, cigarettes.
-Give me a cigar.

142
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,214
-Keep the change.
-20 bucks.

143
00:11:26,287 --> 00:11:28,721
Gee, that entitles you to a match.

144
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,194
Cigars, cigarettes.

145
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:39,789
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Club Petite presents three boys

146
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:43,530
who will give you their vocal impressions
of well-known bands on the radio.

147
00:11:43,604 --> 00:11:46,300
May l introduce to you the Oxford Boys.

148
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:52,479
Let's dance a while
to the original Kay Kyser style.

149
00:12:03,524 --> 00:12:06,254
Evening, folks. How you all?

150
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:11,322
Presenting Mr. Harry Babbitt.

151
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:17,564
l'm always thinking of you

152
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:25,076
So long, everybody.

153
00:12:31,652 --> 00:12:34,280
lt's pleasure time.

154
00:12:34,355 --> 00:12:40,658
A cigarette, sweet music and you

155
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:47,866
A perfect blend for dreaming come true

156
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:51,837
Light up and listen
to the shortest 15 minutes on radio

157
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:55,341
with Fred Waring and his Pennsylvanians.

158
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:58,936
And this is Fred Waring
and over half-a-hundred Pennsylvanians

159
00:12:59,013 --> 00:13:01,709
saying even in sleep, a song is the thing.

160
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,750
Good night, all.

161
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:08,811
From coast to coast it's Horace Heidt,
the trumpeters and the singing guitar.

162
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:44,315
Here's the country's number one
trumpet player, Harry James,

163
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,484
playing Sleepy Lagoon.

164
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:16,149
The sweetest music this side of heaven,
with Guy Lombardo and the trio singing.

165
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:18,783
You are my sunshine

166
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:21,054
My only sunshine

167
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:23,961
You make me happy

168
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:25,760
When skies are gray

169
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:31,068
And here's our own sentimental
gentleman of swing, Tommy Dorsey,

170
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:34,130
his trombone and his band.

171
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:53,962
Oh, l forgot to tell you.
Willie the wolf man's out there waiting.

172
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:56,969
Yes, l know. He sent in the evidence.

173
00:18:57,037 --> 00:19:01,838
Oh, six orchids. My, my, my!

174
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:04,843
What's he trying to do, landscape you?

175
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:09,876
What a catch. Filthy rich, too.

176
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:13,511
They say this man's got more lettuce
than in a Victory Garden.

177
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:15,578
And marriageable, too.

178
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:18,454
Now, don't you worry about me.
l'm not falling for anyone.

179
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:21,221
Not until l see
the whites of their checkbooks.

180
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:26,458
-Maybe that's your rich guy.
-Maybe that's my poor guy.

181
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,057
You mean Alec?

182
00:19:28,135 --> 00:19:29,864
You better forget about him.

183
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:33,235
Don't you go passing up no
golden opportunities like rich Mr. Willie.

184
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:37,208
Opportunities like him just tap once,
and gently.

185
00:19:42,816 --> 00:19:44,647
lt's your poor man.

186
00:19:44,718 --> 00:19:47,209
-Hello, Niagara.
-Oh, hello. What are you doing?

187
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:50,620
-Playing one-nighters in dressing rooms?
-Mais oui, madame.

188
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:53,023
So sorry you are leaving.

189
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:55,994
-Was l leaving?
-Yes, Niagara.

190
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,189
Well, l guess l'm leaving.

191
00:20:06,106 --> 00:20:08,040
l see you take the baby everywhere.

192
00:20:08,108 --> 00:20:10,474
And she just learned a new song.

193
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:15,106
l wish that l could hear it, Alec,
but l haven't time tonight.

194
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,179
Sorry.

195
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:23,147
Well, the song can keep.

196
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:27,319
l'm trying it out with Dorsey tonight.

197
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:31,358
l wanted you to be the first to hear it.

198
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:37,260
You got a date?

199
00:20:39,106 --> 00:20:40,596
l guess l got a minute.

200
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:42,869
-One chorus, huh?
-One chorus.

201
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:56,113
Do l love you, do l?

202
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:03,395
Doesn't one and one make two?

203
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:09,493
Do l love you, do l?

204
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:15,530
Does July need a sky of blue?

205
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:21,605
Would l miss you, would l?

206
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:27,916
lf you ever should go away

207
00:21:27,988 --> 00:21:32,823
lf the sun should desert the day

208
00:21:32,893 --> 00:21:35,987
What would life be?

209
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:46,170
Will l leave you? Never

210
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:51,973
Could the ocean leave the shore?

211
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:58,507
Will l worship you forever?

212
00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:04,524
lsn't heaven forevermore?

213
00:22:04,591 --> 00:22:10,257
Do l love you, do l?

214
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:17,168
Oh, my dear, it's so easy to see

215
00:22:21,274 --> 00:22:25,540
Don't you know l do?

216
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:29,081
Don't l show you l do?

217
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:35,952
Just as you love me

218
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:57,375
Say, the song's better than l thought.

219
00:22:57,444 --> 00:22:59,844
Now, look what you've done.

220
00:22:59,913 --> 00:23:04,111
-What have l done?
-Hit me when my guard was down.

221
00:23:04,184 --> 00:23:06,243
Do l love you.

222
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,753
-Do you, May?
-No.

223
00:23:08,822 --> 00:23:11,450
l've decided not to fall in love right now.

224
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:13,424
As if it's up to you to decide.

225
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:15,984
-You're human, aren't you?
-l hope not.

226
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:18,257
-Now, May, look.
-l'm looking and what do l see?

227
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:21,789
A nice guy with brown eyes who
writes great songs and hasn't got a nickel.

228
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:24,598
-Maybe not now but...
-Yeah, l know. Things'll get better.

229
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:26,639
That's what my mother and dad said.

230
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:29,937
She was the prettiest girl on the block
and he was the nicest guy.

231
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,170
lt was love at first sight

232
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:34,509
and when they took another look,
they were hitched, on $20 a week.

233
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:38,244
Yes, and only a few years later,
he was making $25.

234
00:23:38,318 --> 00:23:39,478
Before you know it,

235
00:23:39,552 --> 00:23:42,487
he bought Mom the nicest ironing board
and washtub you ever saw.

236
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:46,047
And then Mom started raking
in as much as 5 whole bucks a week.

237
00:23:46,126 --> 00:23:47,252
Wasn't that swell?

238
00:23:47,327 --> 00:23:50,262
Now you don't think
l'd let you take in laundry?

239
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:53,128
Well, my folks didn't start out
with that idea, either.

240
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:55,793
They were married.
That was their first mistake.

241
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:58,394
l was their second.
They had to eat. That was their third.

242
00:23:58,471 --> 00:24:00,962
Maybe your dad didn't have my prospects.

243
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,906
l'm a rising young man.

244
00:24:02,976 --> 00:24:05,843
Yes, you are
and you'll rise a lot faster without me.

245
00:24:05,912 --> 00:24:10,008
-You'd help me.
-Yeah. l'm all you need.

246
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:14,245
My dad had ambitions, too,
but he kept holding onto a job he hated

247
00:24:14,321 --> 00:24:17,256
so there'd be some security in the family.

248
00:24:17,324 --> 00:24:19,485
He finally forgot his ambitions.

249
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:24,094
-My dad was a nice guy.
-Sure, he was.

250
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:27,896
-So are you.
-Thanks.

251
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:30,596
That's why l don't want to see you
come to what my dad came to.

252
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,433
l love you too much.

253
00:24:35,742 --> 00:24:37,209
You said you loved me!

254
00:24:37,277 --> 00:24:40,371
-Gosh, l never said that before.
-Go on, say it again.

255
00:24:40,447 --> 00:24:42,813
-Alec, you're on.
-Coming.

256
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:45,407
l'll be right back after my number.

257
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,851
Don't go away now.

258
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:31,958
Do l love you, do l?

259
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:38,232
Doesn't one and one make two?

260
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:44,402
Do l love you, do l?

261
00:25:44,477 --> 00:25:50,006
Does July need a sky of blue?

262
00:25:51,184 --> 00:25:57,020
Do l love you, do l?

263
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:03,290
Oh, my dear, it's so easy to see

264
00:26:03,363 --> 00:26:05,888
Don't you know l do?

265
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:09,457
Don't l show you l do?

266
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:14,405
Just as you love me

267
00:27:58,645 --> 00:28:00,374
Say it again.

268
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:03,176
-Say what?
-That you love me.

269
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:04,716
All right.

270
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:06,149
l love you.

271
00:28:10,557 --> 00:28:12,821
What's the matter, honey?

272
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:15,190
You don't sound like you mean it.

273
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:17,929
l don't, so get going.

274
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:23,058
Hey, what goes on here?
What's the matter with you?

275
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:25,195
Nothing's the matter with me.

276
00:28:25,271 --> 00:28:26,966
Are you mixed up.

277
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,803
ln one breath you can tell me you love me,

278
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:32,003
-in the next breath you...
-l can say get going.

279
00:28:34,247 --> 00:28:36,078
All right, l will.

280
00:28:38,618 --> 00:28:40,984
What are you gonna do?
Live on a desert island?

281
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:44,182
No, but l can't afford to marry for love.

282
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:47,719
Maybe l can find a guy
with money in the bank.

283
00:28:48,328 --> 00:28:50,523
Once l'm married,

284
00:28:50,597 --> 00:28:54,033
who knows, maybe
l might even get to liking him a little.

285
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,500
Well, l wish you luck.

286
00:28:56,569 --> 00:29:00,096
But get this straight, l don't agree
with any of your phony philosophy.

287
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:04,234
The only part that makes any sense
is where you said you loved me.

288
00:29:04,677 --> 00:29:07,009
Well, l love you, too.

289
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,240
Plenty.

290
00:29:08,314 --> 00:29:10,475
Enough to hope you get
those screwy ideas out of your head

291
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,484
and get yourself straightened out.

292
00:29:19,192 --> 00:29:21,990
Louis, you never give me a tumble.

293
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:24,256
Can nothing ever come
of our beautiful friendship?

294
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,763
Not if l can help it.

295
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:28,130
But we could be so happy together.

296
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:32,433
Can't you see l love you and want you
for the father of my children?

297
00:29:32,505 --> 00:29:33,802
l didn't know you had any.

298
00:29:33,873 --> 00:29:37,832
Well, if that's the way you're gonna act,
then give me my ring back.

299
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,036
Okay, you can take me home.

300
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:41,945
But remember,
we say good night at the door.

301
00:29:42,015 --> 00:29:46,179
-Now, does that make you happy?
-Does that make me happy?

302
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:48,117
Well, don't overdo it.

303
00:29:53,526 --> 00:29:55,494
ls that the fly in the soup?

304
00:29:56,496 --> 00:30:00,159
-Don't worry, l'll get rid of him.
-No, Rami, no rough stuff.

305
00:30:04,671 --> 00:30:09,199
Sahib, l have a personal message
for you from the spirit world.

306
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:10,708
But l can't give it to you here.

307
00:30:10,777 --> 00:30:13,541
We must step outside into the alley
where it is dark.

308
00:30:13,613 --> 00:30:15,581
The vibrations are much better out there.

309
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:18,048
Take your hand off me.
Now go away. Don't bother me.

310
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:19,550
But this is about May Daly.

311
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:22,611
Well, there's nothing you or that phony
crystal ball could tell me about May Daly.

312
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:24,122
Now get out.

313
00:30:41,374 --> 00:30:43,399
You clumsy fool!

314
00:30:43,476 --> 00:30:44,943
Why don't you look what you're doing?

315
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:46,535
l'm sorry. lt was an accident.
Terribly sorry.

316
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:49,308
You're sorry? You ought to be sorry.

317
00:30:49,382 --> 00:30:51,213
You dress in good taste.

318
00:30:51,284 --> 00:30:54,310
You clumsy idiot.
You'll pay for this. l'll have your job.

319
00:30:54,387 --> 00:30:56,878
What do you want his job for?
He only gets 20 bucks a week.

320
00:30:56,956 --> 00:30:58,514
Look at me. Look at me.

321
00:30:58,591 --> 00:31:02,493
-l am looking at you and l can't stand it.
-Shut up.

322
00:31:02,562 --> 00:31:05,087
-Oh, May, your new boyfriend's waiting.
-Thanks, Ginny.

323
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:08,031
You know, that guy tips 20 bucks
every time he buys a cigar?

324
00:31:08,101 --> 00:31:11,036
Why don't you take some along?
lt can't hurt.

325
00:31:12,472 --> 00:31:15,964
Baldor tells me
that Miss Daly's date has been canceled.

326
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:19,102
The chef is about to serve Willie
on the dollar dinner.

327
00:31:21,114 --> 00:31:24,242
Why, Willie, whatever happened to you?
How did you get like that?

328
00:31:24,317 --> 00:31:25,511
l was sitting here waiting for you

329
00:31:25,585 --> 00:31:29,544
and this stupid waiter spilled
a whole chef's salad all over me.

330
00:31:29,622 --> 00:31:31,852
Willie, it's too bad, but...

331
00:31:31,924 --> 00:31:35,291
Well, you just can't stand there.
You better go home.

332
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:37,556
Well, we've got a party arranged.
What am l going to do?

333
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,723
We're supposed to go
to the Rainbow Room.

334
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:41,699
-Like that?
-Well...

335
00:31:41,768 --> 00:31:43,895
You better get that suit off
before it turns sour.

336
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,130
Well, that's a good idea.

337
00:31:45,204 --> 00:31:47,764
Come up to my apartment.
lt's nice and cozy.

338
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,467
Oh, l mean, while l change my clothes.

339
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:51,476
No, thanks, Willie,
l think l'll just run along.

340
00:31:51,544 --> 00:31:53,842
-Well, l'll drive you.
-No, it's all right, l'd rather walk.

341
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:55,380
The air'll do me good. Good night.

342
00:31:55,448 --> 00:31:56,437
Well, l...

343
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,579
-Good night, Louis.
-Good night, Miss Daly.

344
00:31:59,652 --> 00:32:01,552
-Good night, Ginny.
-Good night.

345
00:32:08,194 --> 00:32:09,786
-Good night, Miss Daly.
-Good night, Charlie.

346
00:32:09,862 --> 00:32:12,228
-May, l mean, Miss Daly.
-Oh, hello, Louis.

347
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:15,756
Are you going in your direction?
l mean, are you going in my direction?

348
00:32:15,835 --> 00:32:17,268
Look, l don't mean to be chasing you,

349
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:18,963
but l heard you say
you wanted to be alone,

350
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:21,404
so l figured you wouldn't mind
if l walked with you.

351
00:32:22,508 --> 00:32:25,966
This coat. l'm two payments behind on it.
lt sort of resists me.

352
00:32:26,045 --> 00:32:27,910
Here. Let me help you.

353
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:34,945
-There.
-Gee, thanks.

354
00:32:35,021 --> 00:32:36,420
Come on.

355
00:32:39,992 --> 00:32:41,653
Oh, excuse me.

356
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:44,355
You'll have to pardon me
if l seem ignorant, but...

357
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:48,560
Well, l never expected to be walking up
52nd Street with May Daly.

358
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:52,161
-Who's she?
-Just a superb artiste, that's all.

359
00:32:52,238 --> 00:32:55,765
-Just a nightclub singer.
-No, you're awful pretty, though.

360
00:32:55,842 --> 00:32:57,901
l don't mean to be rude,

361
00:32:57,977 --> 00:33:00,775
but you remind me
of one of those beautiful girls in Esquire.

362
00:33:00,847 --> 00:33:02,371
The ones with clothes on, of course.

363
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:14,357
l hope you don't mind riding home
on a subway.

364
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:16,918
Compared to the boarding house l live in,
this is privacy.

365
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:18,020
Yeah, l know what you mean.

366
00:33:18,097 --> 00:33:19,655
The boarding house where l live
is so crowded,

367
00:33:19,732 --> 00:33:21,927
you have to take a bath piggyback.

368
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:24,299
Yeah, but you won't always
be riding on these things.

369
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:27,999
Someday you'll be riding back and forth
to work in a big limousine.

370
00:33:28,074 --> 00:33:29,598
Tell me more.

371
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:34,873
Say, you know, Miss May,
you've got to develop confidence.

372
00:33:34,947 --> 00:33:37,438
Who do you think pulls in millionaires
in that club every night?

373
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:38,779
May Daly.

374
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:40,649
Some millionaires'll go anywhere.

375
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,212
Nah, don't you kid yourself.
They're all crazy about you.

376
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:46,588
You could marry the whole bunch of them.

377
00:33:46,659 --> 00:33:49,924
Well, l'll settle for one,
better than that, half of one.

378
00:33:49,996 --> 00:33:52,055
Half a millionaire's no good,
taxes'll eat him up.

379
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:54,929
May Daly's got to have
a whole millionaire or nothing.

380
00:33:55,001 --> 00:33:56,992
Well, suppose she can't find one
that she likes?

381
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:58,229
Likes?

382
00:33:58,304 --> 00:34:01,796
-Oh, l'm sorry, madam, sit here.
-Oh, you shouldn't have gotten up.

383
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:04,604
What do you have to like them for?
That's for ordinary girls.

384
00:34:04,677 --> 00:34:06,201
You can have anyone you want.

385
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:09,442
-Suppose l want to marry a poor guy?
-What for?

386
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:12,541
Well, you marry a rich guy for money.
What would you marry a poor guy for?

387
00:34:12,618 --> 00:34:14,677
-What?
-For love.

388
00:34:14,754 --> 00:34:16,415
Do you love her?

389
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:19,515
Well... Well, who wouldn't? But, gee, l...

390
00:34:19,592 --> 00:34:23,688
-You love him?
-Louis is a sweet boy, but l don't...

391
00:34:23,763 --> 00:34:26,231
Got anyone else in mind?

392
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:28,358
Hey, you're not thinking of Alec, are you?

393
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:32,131
Are you? That's who it is. lt's Alec.

394
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:34,263
-Has he got money?
-No.

395
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,673
He's so poor he don't have
a pair of shoestrings that match.

396
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:41,235
My dear, when l was your age
l could've married money.

397
00:34:41,314 --> 00:34:45,410
But instead l picked a very poor man
whom l loved dearly.

398
00:34:45,484 --> 00:34:48,078
John and l have been married for 50 years,

399
00:34:48,154 --> 00:34:53,353
and day by day our love has bloomed
into the most wonderful hatred.

400
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:56,156
Next time l get hitched, it's for dough.

401
00:35:18,999 --> 00:35:24,335
Let's go back two thousand years
or more perchance

402
00:35:24,405 --> 00:35:26,202
Before Delilah

403
00:35:26,273 --> 00:35:27,763
Before Godiva

404
00:35:27,841 --> 00:35:31,140
Before Gypsy Rose Lee was alive

405
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,975
Way, way back

406
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:35,743
Before they ever heard of Oomph Girls

407
00:35:37,384 --> 00:35:42,981
At that time there lived a dame
who did her dance

408
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:46,117
Without a bubble that blew to smidgens

409
00:35:46,193 --> 00:35:49,685
Without a fan or without a flock of pigeons

410
00:35:49,763 --> 00:35:50,855
Way, way back

411
00:35:50,931 --> 00:35:55,368
Before the Greeks
had a word for Oomph Girls

412
00:35:55,436 --> 00:35:58,963
With seven veils she wowed the males

413
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:02,531
And made the hall of fame

414
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:06,376
And this modern swing and stuff and thing

415
00:36:06,447 --> 00:36:11,316
All dates back to this dame

416
00:36:12,486 --> 00:36:18,015
Salome was the grandma of them all

417
00:36:20,027 --> 00:36:24,589
She had the stuff
that makes your motor stall

418
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:29,768
This babe took Babylon by storm

419
00:36:29,837 --> 00:36:33,568
And handed down that magic formula

420
00:36:33,641 --> 00:36:38,442
That takes the wallflowers off the wall

421
00:36:38,512 --> 00:36:41,913
Yes, they swing and sway

422
00:36:41,982 --> 00:36:45,418
Shimmy shammy, but they show me

423
00:36:45,486 --> 00:36:47,886
No matter how you slice it

424
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:51,118
Boy, it's still Salome

425
00:36:57,865 --> 00:37:01,926
On Samson and Delilah here's a tip

426
00:37:04,171 --> 00:37:08,767
She got her man, but with no barber's clip

427
00:37:10,778 --> 00:37:13,804
She merely went into her dance

428
00:37:13,881 --> 00:37:17,578
The day she found him
with his panzer unit

429
00:37:17,651 --> 00:37:20,643
And her blitzkrieg was a pip

430
00:37:22,623 --> 00:37:25,649
Yes, it's box office

431
00:37:25,726 --> 00:37:29,162
Minsky gives them a diplomie

432
00:37:29,229 --> 00:37:31,754
But no matter how you slice it

433
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:34,926
Boy, it's still Salome

434
00:37:41,508 --> 00:37:43,169
You can slice it thick

435
00:37:43,243 --> 00:37:44,835
You can slice it thin

436
00:37:44,912 --> 00:37:47,881
Or you needn't slice it at all

437
00:37:47,948 --> 00:37:49,472
You can cut it long

438
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,245
You can cut it short

439
00:37:51,318 --> 00:37:54,515
You can hang it up on the wall

440
00:37:54,588 --> 00:37:58,251
But when they claim it's something new

441
00:37:58,325 --> 00:38:02,591
lt really doesn't throw me

442
00:38:02,663 --> 00:38:04,187
For no matter

443
00:38:06,133 --> 00:38:08,624
how you slice it

444
00:38:09,403 --> 00:38:16,138
lt's still comes out Salome

445
00:38:37,698 --> 00:38:41,134
-l'm looking for a Mr. Louis Blore.
-That's me.

446
00:38:41,201 --> 00:38:43,192
Will you sign right here?

447
00:38:46,673 --> 00:38:48,072
What's this?

448
00:38:48,675 --> 00:38:51,803
-Hey, what's this?
-That's a check for your hat.

449
00:38:56,116 --> 00:38:59,210
-Give me me hat.
-Yes, sir.

450
00:38:59,286 --> 00:39:01,754
-Well, give me your check.
-Give me me hat.

451
00:39:01,822 --> 00:39:04,586
-Now, let's not lose your head.
-Let's not lose your teeth.

452
00:39:04,658 --> 00:39:06,455
-Give me me hat.
-Well, give me a check.

453
00:39:06,527 --> 00:39:07,687
-My hat, please?
-Yes, sir.

454
00:39:07,761 --> 00:39:09,558
-Get in line. Give me me hat.
-My hat, please.

455
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,892
-Yes, sir.
-Give me me hat.

456
00:39:10,964 --> 00:39:12,192
Quiet.

457
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,594
l'm sorry, sir.

458
00:39:21,508 --> 00:39:22,770
Ambrose.

459
00:39:24,745 --> 00:39:26,713
-My hat, please.
-Check, please.

460
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,838
Oh.

461
00:39:35,556 --> 00:39:37,456
Here's your telegram.

462
00:39:37,524 --> 00:39:40,618
-What's that?
-l don't know. Where's its head?

463
00:39:40,694 --> 00:39:44,130
-Give me my toupee.
-Check, please. Oh!

464
00:39:44,198 --> 00:39:46,428
l shall never come here again.

465
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:50,598
Here's your telegram.

466
00:39:50,671 --> 00:39:53,162
You know, you just cost me
one of my best customers.

467
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,868
-He's a millionaire.
-He didn't even tip you.

468
00:39:55,943 --> 00:39:58,878
Just the same, if l had his dough,
l wouldn't be in here checking derbies.

469
00:39:58,946 --> 00:40:02,177
l'd be in there using $20 bills for napkins.

470
00:40:02,249 --> 00:40:05,912
Hey, why is it all the rich people
have all the money?

471
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:08,045
Well, maybe some day
my luck will change.

472
00:40:08,121 --> 00:40:11,056
-Hey, ain't you gonna read that?
-lt's probably from the finance company.

473
00:40:11,124 --> 00:40:13,991
Unless, of course,
l've won the sweepstakes.

474
00:40:15,562 --> 00:40:19,760
''This is to notify you
that you've won first prize of $150,000

475
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:22,028
''in the lrish Grand National Sweepstakes.''

476
00:40:22,102 --> 00:40:24,434
You know, l've been
parking fedoras here for five years.

477
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,439
l never made a mistake
until you came along.

478
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,407
Now, l've won the sweepstakes.

479
00:40:29,276 --> 00:40:30,903
Sweepstakes!

480
00:40:55,669 --> 00:40:57,534
-Oh, thank you.
-Well, that's all right.

481
00:40:57,604 --> 00:41:00,835
Well, Mr. Blore, won't you say a few words
to your millions of new friends?

482
00:41:00,908 --> 00:41:01,932
Well, thank you.

483
00:41:02,009 --> 00:41:05,672
Hello, Mom. lt was a tough sweepstake,
but my horse won.

484
00:41:05,746 --> 00:41:07,907
You know, all my life
l've been kind to dumb animals,

485
00:41:07,981 --> 00:41:11,781
but this is the first time
a dumb animal has ever been kind to me.

486
00:41:11,852 --> 00:41:13,717
And we're glad you won, Mr. Blore.

487
00:41:13,787 --> 00:41:15,982
But l'm sure our listeners
would like to know one thing.

488
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:17,921
Were you very excited
when you received the news?

489
00:41:17,991 --> 00:41:22,519
Well, l started off to be,
but l put a stop to it quick by collapsing.

490
00:41:22,596 --> 00:41:25,292
Well, l don't blame you, Mr. Blore.
You must feel like a king.

491
00:41:25,365 --> 00:41:28,857
-King Louis, that's me.
-King Louis? Oh, very good.

492
00:41:28,936 --> 00:41:32,599
Well, Your Majesty,
who's the lucky girl to be your queen?

493
00:41:32,673 --> 00:41:34,573
-Haven't you read the newspapers?
-No.

494
00:41:34,641 --> 00:41:36,700
Well, l'm figuring on marrying Du Barry.

495
00:41:36,777 --> 00:41:39,837
-Who?
-Du Barry, that's if she'll have me.

496
00:41:39,913 --> 00:41:41,403
Well, l'm off to break the news.

497
00:41:41,481 --> 00:41:42,846
Oh, by the way, dear friends,

498
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:46,408
if you'd like to have one of my pictures
autographed, absolutely free,

499
00:41:46,486 --> 00:41:51,116
just send in a $20 bill
to cover the cost of mailing and wrapping.

500
00:41:51,191 --> 00:41:53,284
Well, Your Majesty,
because you've been so kind

501
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,918
as to participate in our broadcast here,

502
00:41:54,995 --> 00:41:57,828
l'm going to present to you,
with the compliments of our sponsor,

503
00:41:57,898 --> 00:42:00,059
a special tube of our De Kay toothpaste.

504
00:42:00,133 --> 00:42:01,157
Oh, thanks.

505
00:42:01,234 --> 00:42:02,667
Oh, by the way,
do you have an empty tube?

506
00:42:02,736 --> 00:42:04,601
-No, l don't.
-Oh, l'm sorry.

507
00:42:07,007 --> 00:42:08,907
Well, how do you like that?

508
00:42:09,409 --> 00:42:13,038
-Did you ever say you'd marry him?
-No, of course not.

509
00:42:13,347 --> 00:42:14,871
That's what's so funny.

510
00:42:14,948 --> 00:42:17,576
Nothing that funny ever happens to me.

511
00:42:24,324 --> 00:42:25,518
May.

512
00:42:27,027 --> 00:42:29,723
-Did you hear Louis on the radio?
-Yes, l did.

513
00:42:29,796 --> 00:42:32,560
-Did you see the newspapers?
-l did.

514
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,567
Very, very funny.

515
00:42:35,936 --> 00:42:38,905
Go ahead and laugh.
You've given me plenty of laughs.

516
00:42:39,406 --> 00:42:42,102
Yeah, l guess l have.

517
00:42:42,943 --> 00:42:45,207
But what about this poor kid
when he finds out?

518
00:42:45,278 --> 00:42:46,575
Finds out what?

519
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:50,981
That you don't have the slightest intention
of going through with this?

520
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:56,321
Why shouldn't l go through with it?
lt's what l've always wanted, isn't it?

521
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,381
l said that love doesn't count
and it still doesn't.

522
00:42:58,458 --> 00:43:00,619
And l said that money does and there it is.

523
00:43:00,694 --> 00:43:02,855
You don't mean
you'd wreck your life and Louis', too,

524
00:43:02,929 --> 00:43:04,954
just because you're sore at me?

525
00:43:05,032 --> 00:43:09,332
Oh, don't flatter yourself.
You don't even enter into my plans.

526
00:43:19,212 --> 00:43:21,043
One moment. One moment, boys.

527
00:43:22,616 --> 00:43:24,641
Tommy, you must do me a favor.

528
00:43:24,718 --> 00:43:26,618
You know Louis
is taking over this place for tonight

529
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:29,554
and l want you and the boys
to give him a real entertainment.

530
00:43:29,623 --> 00:43:32,649
-Please, you'll do it for me, Tommy, huh?
-Okay, Nick.

531
00:43:32,726 --> 00:43:35,194
Fellows, you know, Louis won
a lot of money in the sweepstakes.

532
00:43:35,262 --> 00:43:37,389
And he's taking the
place over tonight to celebrate.

533
00:43:41,735 --> 00:43:43,066
Hey, slim.

534
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:44,862
Hey.

535
00:43:46,306 --> 00:43:49,104
Keep an eye on your kelly?
Watch your lid? Park your derby?

536
00:43:49,176 --> 00:43:53,476
No, no, that's not the way.
This is a high-class place.

537
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:57,745
When a gentleman walks in,
you smile and say, ''Check your hat, sir?''

538
00:43:59,019 --> 00:44:02,682
-That's it. That always slips me mind.
-lt'll come to you gradually.

539
00:44:02,756 --> 00:44:03,848
Say, how's business?

540
00:44:03,924 --> 00:44:07,416
l ain't had a customer yet,
but l sure love the work.

541
00:44:07,494 --> 00:44:10,361
ls that my old uniform?
lt's too small for you, ain't it?

542
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:11,863
No, l'm just in it too far.

543
00:44:11,932 --> 00:44:14,332
Well, maybe we should have
given this job to a girl.

544
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:17,893
But you can't get any.
They're all working in shipyards.

545
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:20,033
Louis.

546
00:44:22,943 --> 00:44:26,140
-Louis, you look wonderful.
-Do l really?

547
00:44:26,213 --> 00:44:29,979
Everything is just as you ordered it, Louis.
l mean, Mr. Blore.

548
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:34,248
Oh, you can call me Louis.
Money ain't changed me. l'm still lovable.

549
00:44:34,321 --> 00:44:35,720
Here, hold this, will you?

550
00:44:35,789 --> 00:44:38,087
Here's a couple of thousand bucks
to cover the brawl.

551
00:44:38,158 --> 00:44:39,853
How'd that $5 bill get in there?

552
00:44:39,926 --> 00:44:43,418
-Now, if you run short, let me know.
-Yes, sir, Louis. The place is yours.

553
00:44:43,497 --> 00:44:44,896
lt's your night to cut a rug.

554
00:44:44,965 --> 00:44:48,765
Gosh, Louis, who'd have ever thought
you was gonna marry May Daly?

555
00:44:48,835 --> 00:44:52,168
Oh, l could tell. That's on account
of me feminine institution.

556
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:53,501
-ls she here?
-Who?

557
00:44:53,573 --> 00:44:56,667
-May Daly, my fiancée.
-Fiancée.

558
00:44:56,743 --> 00:44:59,610
l want to hear that from her own lips
before l believe it.

559
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:01,112
You will. You will, don't worry.

560
00:45:01,181 --> 00:45:02,580
Hey, how do you like my glad rags, huh?

561
00:45:02,649 --> 00:45:04,378
Hey, did you get
two pair of pants with that suit?

562
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:06,544
Louis, l hardly recognized you.

563
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,453
You look like something out of Esquire.

564
00:45:09,523 --> 00:45:12,754
When l buy an Esquire

565
00:45:12,826 --> 00:45:16,227
The bible of the well-dressed man

566
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:19,356
My pulse jumps ten points higher

567
00:45:19,432 --> 00:45:23,334
But not because of each Dapper Dan

568
00:45:23,403 --> 00:45:24,893
l don't go in for fashions

569
00:45:24,971 --> 00:45:26,939
l forget the authors'names

570
00:45:27,007 --> 00:45:29,373
The only thing l go for

571
00:45:29,442 --> 00:45:34,709
Are those beautiful dames

572
00:45:34,781 --> 00:45:37,807
l love an Esquire girl

573
00:45:37,884 --> 00:45:41,217
lf you don't love an Esquire girl

574
00:45:41,288 --> 00:45:44,485
You won't like steak, apple strudel

575
00:45:44,558 --> 00:45:48,016
Angel cake, soup with noodles

576
00:45:48,094 --> 00:45:54,158
You would eat an oyster
but you'd throw away the pearl

577
00:45:54,234 --> 00:45:59,035
lf you don't love an Esquire girl

578
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:04,200
l love a Varga girl

579
00:46:04,277 --> 00:46:07,542
lf you don't love a Varga girl

580
00:46:07,614 --> 00:46:10,845
You'd laugh out loud at Whistler's Mother

581
00:46:10,917 --> 00:46:14,114
Frankenstein is sure to be your brother

582
00:46:14,187 --> 00:46:20,285
You would buy a Persian lamb
and cut off every curl

583
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:26,026
lf you don't love a Varga girl

584
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:30,092
Those lovely pictures by Hurrell

585
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:33,731
l hang on every wall

586
00:46:33,807 --> 00:46:40,371
They're so swell
l have to yell Hurrell for them all

587
00:46:40,447 --> 00:46:43,439
l crave a lovely girl

588
00:46:43,516 --> 00:46:46,679
lf you don't crave a lovely girl

589
00:46:46,753 --> 00:46:50,018
You've got a head, but what's below it?

590
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:53,526
You're half dead, but you don't know it

591
00:46:53,627 --> 00:46:59,862
And if Lana Turner
doesn't set your brain awhirl

592
00:46:59,933 --> 00:47:05,997
Then you don't love a lovely girl

593
00:47:10,076 --> 00:47:14,172
lf you still don't love a lovely girl

594
00:47:14,247 --> 00:47:17,683
There's something you should see

595
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:22,720
The calendar that we present

596
00:47:22,789 --> 00:47:27,590
For 1943

597
00:47:30,997 --> 00:47:35,024
January, you resolve

598
00:47:35,101 --> 00:47:39,765
to start the year out fine

599
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:43,400
February, you make every

600
00:47:43,476 --> 00:47:47,606
heart a valentine

601
00:47:47,681 --> 00:47:52,914
March, you're just a bit unruly

602
00:47:56,056 --> 00:48:01,619
April, you're so April fooly

603
00:48:04,297 --> 00:48:07,789
May, you're so romantic

604
00:48:07,867 --> 00:48:12,395
with your magic touch of spring

605
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:16,636
June, you have each couple hoping

606
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:20,407
wedding bells will ring

607
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,711
July brings out that good old

608
00:48:23,783 --> 00:48:28,277
Yankee Doodle in me

609
00:48:28,355 --> 00:48:33,156
And August, what a wonderful

610
00:48:33,226 --> 00:48:37,026
vacation you'd be

611
00:48:37,097 --> 00:48:40,464
Sweet September, you arrive

612
00:48:40,533 --> 00:48:45,129
and disappear too soon

613
00:48:45,205 --> 00:48:48,038
But you bring October

614
00:48:48,108 --> 00:48:52,977
and a lovely harvest moon

615
00:48:53,046 --> 00:48:56,379
November makes us thankful

616
00:48:56,449 --> 00:49:01,352
for the blessings we hold dear

617
00:49:01,421 --> 00:49:06,688
December makes us realize

618
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:12,756
it's been a lovely year

619
00:49:19,372 --> 00:49:21,966
l crave a lovely girl

620
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:25,102
lf you don't crave a lovely girl

621
00:49:25,178 --> 00:49:28,306
You've got a head, but what's below it?

622
00:49:28,381 --> 00:49:31,373
You're half dead, but you don't know it

623
00:49:31,451 --> 00:49:37,321
And if Lana Turner
doesn't set your brain awhirl

624
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:44,091
Then you don't love a lovely girl

625
00:49:59,112 --> 00:50:01,706
-Are you Mr. Louis Blore?
-No, that's him there.

626
00:50:01,781 --> 00:50:04,272
Hey, Louis. Just leave it there. Louis.

627
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,344
Gee, it's beautiful, isn't it?

628
00:50:08,421 --> 00:50:12,881
-L and M. Get what it stands for?
-Sure, ladies and men.

629
00:50:12,959 --> 00:50:15,223
No, Louis and May.

630
00:50:15,295 --> 00:50:16,853
-Take it to her dressing room.
-Yes, sir.

631
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,455
-Be sure and put it in water.
-Water?

632
00:50:29,142 --> 00:50:31,269
-Here, put it over here.
-Oh, isn't that lovely?

633
00:50:31,344 --> 00:50:33,938
-There's a cake for a king.
-Must have cost a fortune.

634
00:50:34,013 --> 00:50:36,447
-Good evening, Louis.
-How are you?

635
00:50:45,592 --> 00:50:47,389
Well, good evening.

636
00:50:48,528 --> 00:50:50,826
-How are you, Miss Daly?
-Miss Daly.

637
00:50:51,898 --> 00:50:54,833
-Come on, kiss the bride.
-Yeah, kiss the bride.

638
00:50:55,368 --> 00:50:57,131
Kiss him, Miss Daly. We'll hold him.

639
00:50:57,203 --> 00:50:59,262
l wish to speak to you, Louis.

640
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:01,201
Sure.

641
00:51:01,274 --> 00:51:02,434
Alone.

642
00:51:06,179 --> 00:51:08,170
Sure, just the two of us.

643
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,547
Sit down, please.

644
00:51:18,892 --> 00:51:21,588
-l've seen the papers.
-Yeah.

645
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:22,958
Have you?

646
00:51:23,029 --> 00:51:26,328
l see you wish to buy me.

647
00:51:26,399 --> 00:51:29,562
Oh, gosh, no, Miss Daly.
l want to marry you.

648
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:33,530
Hey, talk to each other or something,
will you?

649
00:51:35,074 --> 00:51:38,043
Well, l'm going to be
very honest with you, Louis.

650
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:41,512
You're a fine boy,
but l'm just not in love with you.

651
00:51:41,581 --> 00:51:44,311
Well, if l was in your place,
l wouldn't be, either.

652
00:51:44,384 --> 00:51:47,080
But you're in a position
to give me a lot of things that l want,

653
00:51:47,153 --> 00:51:49,587
so all right.

654
00:51:49,656 --> 00:51:54,025
But it'll have to be purely
a business arrangement.

655
00:51:54,961 --> 00:51:58,192
-You know what l mean?
-Sure. Sure, you...

656
00:51:59,065 --> 00:52:02,523
Hey, dance, will you?
Mill around. Talk or...

657
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:06,568
So, if you're satisfied with...

658
00:52:07,073 --> 00:52:09,234
lf you want someone who...

659
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:13,643
l mean, l'm marrying you
just for your money.

660
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,704
Sure, you'd be marrying me for my money,

661
00:52:15,782 --> 00:52:18,250
but maybe you could
learn to love me just a little

662
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:20,718
and, well, l might win
another sweepstake and...

663
00:52:20,787 --> 00:52:24,348
Well, if the terms are agreeable
to you, Louis,

664
00:52:24,424 --> 00:52:27,257
l'd be most happy to accept.

665
00:52:29,028 --> 00:52:31,496
Hey, everybody, guess what?

666
00:52:31,564 --> 00:52:34,897
May's getting married.
To me, of all people.

667
00:52:37,637 --> 00:52:40,265
Well, what are we waiting for?
Drinks for everybody.

668
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:44,276
And none of that 1942 champagne.
Give them the old stuff, the 1940.

669
00:52:44,344 --> 00:52:46,244
You bet, Louis.

670
00:52:46,312 --> 00:52:50,305
Oh, l almost forgot.
This is for you, Miss Daly. l mean, honey.

671
00:52:50,383 --> 00:52:53,375
-That's a beauty.
-What a ring.

672
00:52:53,453 --> 00:52:54,784
Hold it out.

673
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:01,250
-l guess this is part of our bargain.
-Well, come on, kiss her.

674
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:08,397
Oh, she's just excited.
She's never married me before.

675
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:12,435
Check your hat? Oh, sorry.

676
00:53:13,506 --> 00:53:17,272
May, l gotta say something. l just gotta.

677
00:53:17,343 --> 00:53:19,402
-What?
-Check your hat?

678
00:53:19,479 --> 00:53:20,707
l love you.

679
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:24,341
Of course you don't have to say it
because l know you don't love me,

680
00:53:24,417 --> 00:53:26,908
-but l wanted you to know...
-Louis.

681
00:53:26,986 --> 00:53:28,578
You're very nice,

682
00:53:28,655 --> 00:53:31,818
and l know you mean everything
you say to me but...

683
00:53:31,891 --> 00:53:34,587
Well, l was just thinking that maybe l...

684
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:38,423
Well, maybe l...

685
00:53:39,866 --> 00:53:42,164
Alec. Come on in and join the party.

686
00:53:42,235 --> 00:53:44,795
Hey, what do you think?
May's gonna marry me.

687
00:53:44,871 --> 00:53:47,339
Louis, why don't you get wise to yourself.

688
00:53:47,407 --> 00:53:49,238
-She doesn't love you.
-l know that.

689
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,038
She's gonna marry me for my money.

690
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:54,238
Will you please keep out of this
and attend to your own affairs?

691
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,145
This is my affair.

692
00:53:56,215 --> 00:53:58,410
Tell him the real reason
you're marrying him.

693
00:53:58,484 --> 00:53:59,610
Go ahead.

694
00:53:59,686 --> 00:54:02,211
Hey, don't talk to her like that
or l'll smack you.

695
00:54:02,288 --> 00:54:03,687
Yeah?

696
00:54:03,756 --> 00:54:05,815
And there's plenty more
where that came from.

697
00:54:05,892 --> 00:54:07,689
Hey, l want to talk to you.

698
00:54:08,861 --> 00:54:12,627
-How's about that lug.
-Hey, he's insulting the almost Mrs. Blore.

699
00:54:12,699 --> 00:54:15,167
We'll fix him. l'll slip him a Rooney.

700
00:54:15,234 --> 00:54:18,135
-A Rooney? What's that?
-That's a high-powered mickey.

701
00:54:18,204 --> 00:54:20,764
Look, l slip this powder into his drink,

702
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,604
and what happens to him
should happen to him.

703
00:54:23,676 --> 00:54:26,338
Oh, no, wait a minute.
Those things aren't dangerous, are they?

704
00:54:26,412 --> 00:54:27,606
No, they ain't displeasant.

705
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,080
He goes into a comma
for about a fortnight.

706
00:54:30,149 --> 00:54:32,549
Maybe longer. Maybe five days.

707
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:35,821
l beg your pardon.

708
00:54:35,888 --> 00:54:39,517
Which of you gentlemen
won the $150,000 sweepstake?

709
00:54:39,592 --> 00:54:42,857
-That was my pal here.
-Well, l'm from the Treasury Department.

710
00:54:42,929 --> 00:54:45,227
-Treasury Department?
-Yes, l'm a collector.

711
00:54:45,298 --> 00:54:46,697
Oh, you want my autograph.

712
00:54:46,766 --> 00:54:49,496
Well, look, l'm a little busy now.
Could you stop around later?

713
00:54:49,569 --> 00:54:52,402
Yeah, see us
the second Tuesday of next week.

714
00:54:52,839 --> 00:54:57,799
Alec is the jack, May is the queen
and Louis is the king.

715
00:54:59,312 --> 00:55:04,181
-l was right. May marries Alec.
-You're not even warm, Rami.

716
00:55:10,323 --> 00:55:11,654
-There he is over there.
-Yeah.

717
00:55:11,724 --> 00:55:12,850
Now, look, here's what you do.

718
00:55:12,925 --> 00:55:15,689
You go over to the guy and say,
''Look, l ain't sore. Have a drink.''

719
00:55:15,762 --> 00:55:18,925
And while the bartender ain't looking, l'll...

720
00:55:18,998 --> 00:55:21,125
Well, how will l know which drink is his?

721
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,997
Well, l'll print.

722
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:25,003
No, l don't think we ought to.

723
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:27,539
But you gotta. You gotta for her sake.

724
00:55:27,607 --> 00:55:29,370
-Go on. Go on.
-Okay.

725
00:55:34,347 --> 00:55:35,439
Hiya.

726
00:55:36,716 --> 00:55:38,479
Hello, sucker.

727
00:55:38,551 --> 00:55:41,111
Oh, look, Alec, l'm not mad at you.

728
00:55:41,187 --> 00:55:42,745
What do you say?
Let's have a drink together.

729
00:55:42,822 --> 00:55:44,187
Sort of a loving cup.

730
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:45,588
Who's loving who?

731
00:55:45,658 --> 00:55:49,685
l'm loving you, you're loving me,
so let's let bygones be bygones.

732
00:55:49,762 --> 00:55:52,094
-Okay, l'll have a drink.
-You will?

733
00:55:52,865 --> 00:55:55,561
-Hey, Cheezy.
-Yes, sir.

734
00:55:55,635 --> 00:55:58,365
-Two drinks and make it snappy.
-Yes, sir.

735
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:04,372
l guess l'm crazy,
but l'm glad May turned me down.

736
00:56:05,211 --> 00:56:07,543
l could never give her
all the things she deserves.

737
00:56:07,613 --> 00:56:08,978
Yeah, sure.

738
00:56:09,582 --> 00:56:12,642
You know, it's too bad
May couldn't marry for love and money.

739
00:56:12,718 --> 00:56:15,448
You mean sort of a double wedding?

740
00:56:15,521 --> 00:56:17,751
-Here you are, Cheezy.
-Oh.

741
00:56:17,824 --> 00:56:19,792
Hey, Cheezy,
is them the drinks that Louis ordered?

742
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:21,759
-Yeah.
-l forgot to tell you.

743
00:56:21,828 --> 00:56:23,625
-They want you on the phone.
-Phone?

744
00:56:23,696 --> 00:56:25,095
Long distance.

745
00:56:25,164 --> 00:56:26,290
-Long distance?
-Yeah.

746
00:56:26,365 --> 00:56:27,798
-Well, l...
-Oh, l'll serve it for you.

747
00:56:27,867 --> 00:56:29,027
-Will you?
-Sure.

748
00:56:29,101 --> 00:56:30,625
-Thanks.
-Okay.

749
00:56:48,888 --> 00:56:52,119
Why don't you go where you're walking?
Look where you're...

750
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:06,596
Well, here they come, pal.

751
00:57:06,672 --> 00:57:09,505
Cheezy was busy. He asked me to serve.

752
00:57:09,575 --> 00:57:11,702
-Some drink, eh?
-Yeah, l'll bet it is.

753
00:57:11,777 --> 00:57:14,245
Nothing too good for me old pal, Alec.

754
00:57:14,313 --> 00:57:16,508
l want to thank you
for tipping me off about May.

755
00:57:16,582 --> 00:57:19,142
-Oh, you finally got it.
-Yeah, l finally got it.

756
00:57:19,218 --> 00:57:20,446
-No, he got it.
-What?

757
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,648
The... Nothing.
l was thinking about something else.

758
00:57:23,723 --> 00:57:25,452
Well, bottoms up.

759
00:57:26,993 --> 00:57:28,119
Any minute now.

760
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:32,290
Here's to l, May and you,
the eternal rectangle.

761
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:34,731
lf this was back
in the glorious days of France,

762
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:37,064
l would be King Louis,
May would be Du Barry,

763
00:57:37,136 --> 00:57:40,503
and you would be
one of the common folks, a pheasant.

764
00:57:47,113 --> 00:57:49,047
l guess you won't take my advice.

765
00:57:49,115 --> 00:57:51,515
You'll marry May, no matter what.

766
00:57:52,952 --> 00:57:57,753
-Well, thanks for the drink, anyway.
-lt was a pleasure.

767
00:57:59,892 --> 00:58:02,326
-Good luck to you and May.
-Thanks.

768
00:58:02,828 --> 00:58:06,355
-l guess it won't be long now.
-Nope, it sure won't.

769
00:58:06,899 --> 00:58:09,493
-How long does it take it to work?
-Well, that's debatable.

770
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:12,834
Well, come on.
l want to be there when it happens.

771
00:58:12,905 --> 00:58:15,738
You know, we're really smart.
We used our heads.

772
00:58:22,815 --> 00:58:25,113
-What's the matter with you?
-Nothing.

773
00:58:49,709 --> 00:58:55,375
Alec is the jack, May is the queen,
Louis is the king.

774
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:57,143
Alec is the jack,

775
00:58:57,483 --> 00:59:01,214
May is the queen,
Louis is the king.

776
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:06,520
Alec is the jack, May is the queen,
Louis is the king.

777
00:59:31,751 --> 00:59:33,878
l don't feel well, fellows.

778
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,191
Hey, where is everybody?

779
00:59:49,268 --> 00:59:50,860
What's the idea
of them funny looking clothes?

780
00:59:50,936 --> 00:59:54,929
-The party turn into a masquerade?
-Your Majesty had a nightmare?

781
00:59:58,310 --> 01:00:00,642
What's everybody staring at me for?

782
01:00:00,713 --> 01:00:03,682
-What's this?
-Your breakfast, sire.

783
01:00:05,317 --> 01:00:07,046
Well, who eats who?

784
01:00:08,387 --> 01:00:12,084
Cheezy! l've been looking for you.

785
01:00:12,158 --> 01:00:15,457
What'd you put in that drink?
You tried to poison me, didn't you?

786
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:17,860
l, poison Your Majesty?

787
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:21,923
l, the Count de Roquefort,
Your Majesty's dietician?

788
01:00:22,001 --> 01:00:26,097
Diet? Oh, l get it.
Now, you're trying to starve me to death.

789
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,767
Look, Cheezy, what's the rib, huh?
Where am l?

790
01:00:31,844 --> 01:00:34,244
Surely Your Majesty knows
this is Versailles.

791
01:00:34,313 --> 01:00:36,213
Versailles?

792
01:00:36,282 --> 01:00:39,911
Could it be that Your Majesty is fatigued
after yesterday's trip to Paris?

793
01:00:39,985 --> 01:00:42,180
What? Paris?

794
01:00:42,254 --> 01:00:44,814
-What was l doing in Paris?
-Your Majesty.

795
01:00:45,624 --> 01:00:46,852
Really?

796
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:50,728
May l retire, my lord?

797
01:00:50,796 --> 01:00:53,993
l have some new taxes
to levy on your subjects.

798
01:00:54,066 --> 01:00:55,829
Now, wait a minute, bub.

799
01:00:55,901 --> 01:00:58,062
l don't mind my pals ribbing me but...

800
01:00:58,137 --> 01:01:00,196
Hey, Cheezy, who is this character?

801
01:01:00,272 --> 01:01:02,934
Why, the Duc de Choiseul,
the Minister of Finance.

802
01:01:03,008 --> 01:01:04,270
Minister of Finance?

803
01:01:04,343 --> 01:01:07,210
And he is the Duc de Rigor,
your Prime Minister.

804
01:01:07,279 --> 01:01:10,476
Oh, last time l saw you,
you were a chef salad.

805
01:01:10,549 --> 01:01:12,278
lf Your Majesty pleases,

806
01:01:12,351 --> 01:01:15,013
l am the Prime Minister
of the Empire of France.

807
01:01:15,087 --> 01:01:19,490
Oh, sure, sure, you're the Prime Minister
and l'm King Louis XV.

808
01:01:19,558 --> 01:01:21,583
Yes, Your Majesty.

809
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:24,390
That settles it. Where's my pants?
l'm getting out of here.

810
01:01:24,463 --> 01:01:27,626
-Hey Cheezy, call me a taxi.
-What's a taxi?

811
01:01:29,702 --> 01:01:32,330
Oh, l get it. lt's a plot.

812
01:01:32,404 --> 01:01:34,338
You're trying to drive me nuts.

813
01:01:34,406 --> 01:01:36,670
You're all after the money
l won in the sweepstakes,

814
01:01:36,742 --> 01:01:38,039
but you won't get it.

815
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:40,408
The FBl is gonna hear about this.

816
01:01:41,213 --> 01:01:43,044
l'll call my own taxi.

817
01:02:08,908 --> 01:02:11,206
''His Majesty, Louis XV, 1743.''

818
01:02:12,778 --> 01:02:14,211
What a setback.

819
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:18,114
Sire, if you're displeased with the portrait,
l will have the artist beheaded.

820
01:02:18,184 --> 01:02:21,950
Listen, bub, if there's any beheading,
l'll give the okay.

821
01:02:22,021 --> 01:02:25,718
-Say, who's king around here, anyway?
-You are, Your Majesty.

822
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:28,585
You sure l ain't the queen?

823
01:02:50,082 --> 01:02:52,949
Good morning, good morning

824
01:02:53,018 --> 01:02:56,181
Good morning to Your Grace

825
01:02:56,255 --> 01:03:00,851
We are here to brighten up
your not-so-very-bright face

826
01:03:04,797 --> 01:03:07,163
Here's the brush to scrub your back

827
01:03:07,233 --> 01:03:10,430
And here's the soap for lather

828
01:03:10,536 --> 01:03:12,800
Here's geranium bath salts

829
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:15,864
Or lavender if you'd rather

830
01:03:15,941 --> 01:03:19,399
Brush to scrub, soap to rub, salt to dub

831
01:03:19,478 --> 01:03:21,002
Schnitzelbank

832
01:03:30,823 --> 01:03:36,386
Now, pray thee tell me, pretty maids
your duty to the throne

833
01:03:36,462 --> 01:03:41,331
After Your Grace has washed his face
we squirt you with cologne

834
01:03:43,636 --> 01:03:46,434
Oh, tra-la-la, la-la, la-la

835
01:03:46,505 --> 01:03:49,065
You've come to wash my face

836
01:03:49,141 --> 01:03:51,234
Tra-la-la, la-la, la-la

837
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:53,938
We've come to wash your face

838
01:03:54,013 --> 01:03:56,914
We've come to wash

839
01:03:56,982 --> 01:04:02,887
your face

840
01:04:02,988 --> 01:04:04,956
That's very good, girls. l liked that.

841
01:04:05,024 --> 01:04:08,425
You can all expect an extra mink coat
in each of your pay envelopes on Saturday.

842
01:04:08,494 --> 01:04:09,518
Well.

843
01:06:34,973 --> 01:06:38,374
Katie went to Haiti

844
01:06:38,444 --> 01:06:40,503
Katie heard a band

845
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:41,910
Swing wide, please

846
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:45,416
She cried, ''Hot potatie, hey''

847
01:06:45,484 --> 01:06:47,315
Jackson, this is grand

848
01:06:47,386 --> 01:06:48,648
Katie liked the band

849
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,347
Thought she'd found the promised land

850
01:06:50,422 --> 01:06:52,947
After a week in Haiti

851
01:06:53,025 --> 01:06:55,994
The island began to thrive

852
01:06:56,061 --> 01:06:57,255
Like a beehive

853
01:06:57,329 --> 01:06:59,695
Katie showed each local lady

854
01:06:59,765 --> 01:07:02,666
Quickly just how to make with the jive

855
01:07:02,734 --> 01:07:04,099
They came from miles around

856
01:07:04,169 --> 01:07:05,693
To watch old Katie go to town

857
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:08,865
And after a month in Haiti

858
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:11,375
She decided it was time to move

859
01:07:11,443 --> 01:07:12,467
Hit the road

860
01:07:12,544 --> 01:07:15,741
But the people asked her not to leave 'em

861
01:07:15,814 --> 01:07:18,305
'Cause Haiti was in the groove

862
01:07:18,383 --> 01:07:19,509
ln the groove

863
01:07:19,585 --> 01:07:22,952
So Katie stayed in Haiti

864
01:07:23,021 --> 01:07:26,149
Her life there, it was great

865
01:07:26,225 --> 01:07:29,922
'Cause Katie went for Haiti

866
01:07:29,995 --> 01:07:34,830
And practically all Haiti went for Katie

867
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,561
From Haiti

868
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:38,330
Katie, Katie, Kay

869
01:07:38,403 --> 01:07:39,995
Katie, Katie, Kay

870
01:07:40,072 --> 01:07:41,699
Hay-de, hay-de-hay

871
01:07:41,773 --> 01:07:43,502
Hay-de, hay-de-hay

872
01:07:43,575 --> 01:07:45,133
Hi-de, hi-de-hi

873
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:46,939
Hi-de, hi-de-hi

874
01:07:47,012 --> 01:07:48,673
Ho-de, ho-de-ho

875
01:07:48,747 --> 01:07:50,339
Ho-de, ho-de-ho

876
01:07:50,415 --> 01:07:54,146
And practically all Haiti

877
01:07:54,219 --> 01:08:00,055
loved Katie

878
01:08:04,429 --> 01:08:05,919
Very good.

879
01:08:06,265 --> 01:08:08,995
Very good.
Very good. Very good.

880
01:08:10,068 --> 01:08:12,263
Tommy. Tommy Dorsey.

881
01:08:12,337 --> 01:08:15,431
The Duc d'Orsay, sire, your court musician.

882
01:08:15,507 --> 01:08:16,701
Really?

883
01:08:17,776 --> 01:08:19,835
But l swore that was Tommy.

884
01:08:19,912 --> 01:08:21,243
Hiya, Pop.

885
01:08:22,481 --> 01:08:23,846
Hiya, Pop.

886
01:08:28,253 --> 01:08:32,053
-Hey, where have l seen him before?
-That's the Dauphin, sire, your son.

887
01:08:33,625 --> 01:08:35,718
-My son!
-l'm sorry, sire.

888
01:08:36,562 --> 01:08:38,052
You're sorry?

889
01:08:45,337 --> 01:08:48,397
The stork that brought him
must have been part wolf.

890
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:54,345
-Hiya, Pop.
-Hey, men don't kiss men.

891
01:08:54,413 --> 01:08:55,812
They do in France, Pop.

892
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:58,406
What do l do now?
Let him wear my fraternity pin?

893
01:08:58,483 --> 01:09:00,781
Hey, where'd you get
all those beautiful girls?

894
01:09:01,954 --> 01:09:05,412
You give them to me for Christmas,
and all the time l wanted a pony.

895
01:09:05,490 --> 01:09:07,924
-Hey, how old are you, son?
-Thirty-two.

896
01:09:07,993 --> 01:09:10,427
Thirty... l'm only 28.

897
01:09:10,495 --> 01:09:12,463
Hey, this don't make sense.

898
01:09:12,531 --> 01:09:14,431
Come here, l want to talk to you.

899
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:18,794
Hey... Will you come here?

900
01:09:20,572 --> 01:09:22,597
l want to have a fatherly talk with you.

901
01:09:22,674 --> 01:09:25,438
Oh, now, l know all about
the birds and the bees...

902
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:27,341
No, no, not that.

903
01:09:27,946 --> 01:09:31,006
What's the setup around here?
Am l really the king?

904
01:09:32,284 --> 01:09:36,152
Anybody that says you ain't, dies.

905
01:09:36,221 --> 01:09:39,349
Will you put that thing away
before you put somebody's eye out?

906
01:09:39,424 --> 01:09:42,291
-Now sit down.
-No, l gotta go. My wife's waiting.

907
01:09:42,361 --> 01:09:45,888
-Your wife? Who's she?
-Marie Antoinette.

908
01:09:45,964 --> 01:09:48,990
Well, if you're married,
why are you chasing around those girls?

909
01:09:49,067 --> 01:09:51,467
Because l want to be like you, Pop.

910
01:09:51,536 --> 01:09:54,903
Now, is that the way
to talk to your father? Sit down.

911
01:09:56,208 --> 01:09:59,439
-Tell me, have l got a girl?
-Have you got a...

912
01:09:59,511 --> 01:10:01,342
Are you kidding, Pop?

913
01:10:01,413 --> 01:10:06,282
First there was Madam Pompadour,
then the Duchess de Châteauroux,

914
01:10:06,351 --> 01:10:08,751
and then Countess Jailbait.

915
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:10,583
How about the queen?

916
01:10:11,757 --> 01:10:14,749
-Gee, l've had quite a past, haven't l?
-l like the girl you got now best.

917
01:10:14,826 --> 01:10:17,420
Yeah? Who is she? Anybody l know?

918
01:10:17,496 --> 01:10:21,956
-Everybody knows. Madam Du Barry.
-Du... Du Barry's my girl.

919
01:10:22,034 --> 01:10:24,195
-How am l doing with her?
-How are you...

920
01:10:24,269 --> 01:10:26,328
-Oh, Papa.
-No kidding.

921
01:10:36,548 --> 01:10:39,915
We are nearing
Madam Du Barry's house, sire.

922
01:10:41,253 --> 01:10:44,051
-Gee, l hope she's in.
-He hopes she's in.

923
01:10:44,122 --> 01:10:47,353
-Hey, do l look all right?
-Does he look all right.

924
01:10:47,426 --> 01:10:49,223
Hey, would you say
she was crazy about me?

925
01:10:49,294 --> 01:10:50,761
Would he say she was crazy about you.

926
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:53,730
Look, sonny, l want an answer,
not an echo.

927
01:10:53,799 --> 01:10:55,164
He wants an echo.

928
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:03,168
Thank you.

929
01:11:06,378 --> 01:11:09,472
-A thousand pardons, Your Majesty.
-Oh, it's not your fault.

930
01:11:09,548 --> 01:11:12,312
Cars 200 years from now
don't have running boards, either.

931
01:11:12,384 --> 01:11:14,909
-Here, Pop, you might need this.
-Thanks.

932
01:11:16,888 --> 01:11:20,119
-What a defense plant that would make.
-Beautiful, isn't it?

933
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:22,285
lt's the nicest one
you've bought Madam Du Barry.

934
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:25,421
Yeah? Let's see,
how many have l bought her now?

935
01:11:25,497 --> 01:11:28,330
Two palaces, four castles,
10 chateaus and a cottage.

936
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,595
Oh, no trailer, huh?

937
01:11:30,669 --> 01:11:33,832
Good luck to you, sire,
and l'll call for you at the usual hour.

938
01:11:33,905 --> 01:11:35,304
Oh, the usual hour.

939
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:37,899
Of course, you'll let me know
when you get here.

940
01:11:55,127 --> 01:11:56,856
Greetings, chum. Open her up.

941
01:11:59,898 --> 01:12:01,160
Sire.

942
01:12:05,137 --> 01:12:07,697
-Du Barry in there?
-Yes, sire.

943
01:12:12,043 --> 01:12:15,342
-You think l ought to knock?
-Not you, sire.

944
01:12:16,581 --> 01:12:19,209
Well, take the afternoon off.
l'll see you around sometime.

945
01:12:19,284 --> 01:12:21,275
-Thank you, sire.
-Fools!

946
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:24,488
You blundering fools!

947
01:12:24,556 --> 01:12:28,492
Soldiers you call yourselves.
You're more like schoolboys.

948
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:31,996
And the next time l give a command,
l want it carried out.

949
01:12:32,063 --> 01:12:35,464
-Yoo-hoo.
-Shut up, you idiot.

950
01:12:35,534 --> 01:12:36,899
This is your last chance.

951
01:12:36,968 --> 01:12:39,937
You find the man l want
and bring him here, to me.

952
01:12:40,005 --> 01:12:42,803
Well, personally,
l think you have enough men here now.

953
01:12:42,874 --> 01:12:45,035
What is this, the boudoir or the barracks?

954
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:47,203
Search every house in France.

955
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:49,679
The Black Arrow must be found
or l'll have your head.

956
01:12:49,748 --> 01:12:52,012
But, madame, this man, he's very clever.

957
01:12:52,083 --> 01:12:55,780
l don't want excuses.
l said l want that man for the last time.

958
01:12:55,854 --> 01:12:57,446
Well, if l were sure it was the last time...

959
01:12:57,522 --> 01:13:01,219
No, you've already got a man.
lt's me, and l'm against hoarding.

960
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:03,124
Hey, take a furlough.

961
01:13:04,763 --> 01:13:06,094
Left face.

962
01:13:06,765 --> 01:13:08,494
At the double, forward march.

963
01:13:15,941 --> 01:13:19,399
The royal flowers from the royal garden
into your royal arms.

964
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:21,673
And right in your royal kisser.

965
01:13:24,216 --> 01:13:26,707
How dare you insult me
in front of the help?

966
01:13:26,785 --> 01:13:31,347
Well, how would you feel if your girl
used your army to catch men for her?

967
01:13:31,423 --> 01:13:34,654
-lt ain't ladylike.
-So that's what you think of me.

968
01:13:37,429 --> 01:13:41,798
l'm sorry. l'm just jealous.
l haven't been myself lately.

969
01:13:41,867 --> 01:13:44,665
The whole world knows
l'm madly in love with you.

970
01:13:44,736 --> 01:13:47,000
-So they tell me.
-Louis, listen.

971
01:13:47,072 --> 01:13:50,371
There's something been going on lately
that l think you should know about.

972
01:13:50,442 --> 01:13:53,240
Last night, a man sneaked
into my bedroom while l was asleep

973
01:13:53,311 --> 01:13:55,711
and pinned this note to my pillow.

974
01:13:56,781 --> 01:13:58,681
''Madam, you have ignored our demands.

975
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:02,186
''Before we take definite action,
we warn you the longer you delay,

976
01:14:02,254 --> 01:14:04,279
''the greater the price you will pay.''

977
01:14:04,356 --> 01:14:07,257
The finance company.
l used to get a lot of these things.

978
01:14:07,325 --> 01:14:10,226
''Be wise, madame.
Save the honor of France.

979
01:14:10,295 --> 01:14:13,196
''End your scandalous alliance
with the King.''

980
01:14:13,265 --> 01:14:15,961
-That don't sound like a finance company.
-l'll tell you who it's from.

981
01:14:16,034 --> 01:14:19,902
lt's from that rabble-rousing, jealous,
night-riding sneak, the Black Arrow.

982
01:14:19,971 --> 01:14:21,063
Can't place him.

983
01:14:21,139 --> 01:14:23,573
This rebellious dog
has been threatening me for months.

984
01:14:23,642 --> 01:14:25,234
Ever since you and l became friends.

985
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:27,972
Oh, that's a good one.
Could His Majesty have a little kiss?

986
01:14:28,046 --> 01:14:30,606
-What about the Black Arrow?
-Let him get his own girl.

987
01:14:30,682 --> 01:14:32,843
So you refuse to deal with this menace.

988
01:14:32,918 --> 01:14:34,943
Look, he left right after pinning the note,
didn't he?

989
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:37,250
He's no menace. He's nuts.

990
01:14:37,322 --> 01:14:40,382
-And so am l, about you.
-Oh, Louis, don't do that again.

991
01:14:40,458 --> 01:14:43,359
Oh, now, wait a minute. l only want a kiss.

992
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:48,658
Why don't you stop this stuff?
We've got to get together.

993
01:14:48,733 --> 01:14:51,634
According to history, l'm supposed to be
the greatest lover in all France.

994
01:14:51,703 --> 01:14:54,536
-Oh, Louis, what's gotten into you?
-Love.

995
01:15:07,085 --> 01:15:08,575
There you are.

996
01:15:09,154 --> 01:15:11,486
Louis, you must control yourself!

997
01:15:13,525 --> 01:15:15,891
Here's an apple, a nice red one.

998
01:15:17,829 --> 01:15:19,057
Louis!

999
01:15:26,638 --> 01:15:29,573
Don't you know the king can do no wrong?

1000
01:15:29,641 --> 01:15:31,302
That's my plan.

1001
01:15:44,389 --> 01:15:46,516
Sit down, will you?

1002
01:15:46,591 --> 01:15:49,116
This ain't a love affair, it's a track meet.

1003
01:15:50,595 --> 01:15:53,223
Louis, this sort of thing must stop.

1004
01:15:54,065 --> 01:15:57,330
Every time you come here,
you chase me all around the room.

1005
01:15:57,402 --> 01:15:58,869
l do?

1006
01:15:59,337 --> 01:16:02,101
l'm sorry if l rushed you,
but l may be dreaming

1007
01:16:02,173 --> 01:16:04,767
and l wanted to catch you
before l woke up.

1008
01:16:04,843 --> 01:16:08,210
Well, this must stop. lt's wearing me out.

1009
01:16:08,279 --> 01:16:10,645
Ain't doing the carpets any good, either.

1010
01:16:11,116 --> 01:16:13,482
Oh, honey, you're just unstrung.

1011
01:16:14,352 --> 01:16:15,842
But this ain't.

1012
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:18,150
Oh, Louis,
are you gonna play that thing again?

1013
01:16:18,223 --> 01:16:19,781
Would you accept this little token?

1014
01:16:19,858 --> 01:16:23,487
Oh, darling.
You really shouldn't have done it.

1015
01:16:23,561 --> 01:16:26,029
-Oh, Louis, l just can't accept this.
-Oh, please, do.

1016
01:16:26,097 --> 01:16:29,726
-Oh, no, really, l just can't accept this.
-All right then, give it back.

1017
01:16:29,801 --> 01:16:33,965
-This must be worth a fortune, isn't it?
-Sure, but l can afford it.

1018
01:16:34,039 --> 01:16:36,337
All l do is tax the people.

1019
01:16:36,408 --> 01:16:39,104
-But there's no tax on kissing.
-Oh, Louis, l'm afraid.

1020
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:41,304
Suppose the Black Arrow
makes good his threat.

1021
01:16:41,379 --> 01:16:44,007
That guy is a rut in the road to romance.

1022
01:16:44,082 --> 01:16:48,280
Some day his head will decorate
the steeple of one of my cheapest palaces.

1023
01:16:48,353 --> 01:16:49,945
l defy him.

1024
01:16:50,588 --> 01:16:54,115
-Can't you see l'm hungry for a kiss?
-You're just hungry.

1025
01:16:54,192 --> 01:16:56,786
Come on, Louis, let's have a crêpe suzette.

1026
01:17:02,867 --> 01:17:04,357
No, thank you.

1027
01:17:04,436 --> 01:17:06,165
No, thank you.

1028
01:17:06,237 --> 01:17:08,637
No, thank you, no.

1029
01:17:09,641 --> 01:17:12,633
l don't mean to be rude

1030
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:16,408
But l'm not in the mood for food

1031
01:17:16,481 --> 01:17:19,939
lt's lovely, it's tempting

1032
01:17:20,018 --> 01:17:23,044
Fit for a king, l know

1033
01:17:23,121 --> 01:17:26,579
Your cooking's a work of art

1034
01:17:26,658 --> 01:17:28,990
But when you're with me

1035
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:33,326
Why be so à la carte?

1036
01:17:34,666 --> 01:17:38,102
Madam, l love your crêpe suzette

1037
01:17:38,169 --> 01:17:41,764
l think your crêpe suzette is wonderful

1038
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:45,173
But for the moment, let's forget

1039
01:17:45,243 --> 01:17:48,804
All about your crêpe suzette

1040
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:52,316
Madam, l love your cheese soufflé

1041
01:17:52,383 --> 01:17:55,944
l think your cheese soufflé is marvelous

1042
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:59,353
But when you look at me that way

1043
01:17:59,424 --> 01:18:02,985
How can l eat cheese soufflé?

1044
01:18:03,061 --> 01:18:05,928
l regret to say

1045
01:18:05,997 --> 01:18:11,902
l'm unable to partake of your table

1046
01:18:11,970 --> 01:18:13,904
You'd be more delish

1047
01:18:13,972 --> 01:18:17,430
Account of you're my favorite dish

1048
01:18:17,509 --> 01:18:20,774
Madam, if l don't touch a bite

1049
01:18:20,845 --> 01:18:24,372
lt's not because l've lost my appetite

1050
01:18:24,449 --> 01:18:27,885
l want what you've got plenty of

1051
01:18:27,952 --> 01:18:31,388
Madam, l came here for love

1052
01:19:35,353 --> 01:19:38,049
My head! l've lost my head! Help!

1053
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:46,494
Help! Help! Help! Help!

1054
01:19:47,332 --> 01:19:48,856
Help! Help!

1055
01:19:54,505 --> 01:19:56,302
Come here, you fools.

1056
01:19:57,442 --> 01:20:00,809
-Why are you never here when l need you?
-l'm sorry, madame.

1057
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:02,813
We have been searching
for the Black Arrow.

1058
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:04,906
We thought we saw him
climbing your balcony.

1059
01:20:04,983 --> 01:20:08,077
Well, he's hiding somewhere.
Surround the palace. Search the grounds.

1060
01:20:08,152 --> 01:20:10,950
But find him. Do you hear me? Find him.

1061
01:20:11,089 --> 01:20:13,455
Yes, madame. Follow me.

1062
01:20:20,932 --> 01:20:23,492
-Thank you, madame.
-You.

1063
01:20:23,568 --> 01:20:27,629
How embarrassing, to be found
hiding behind a woman's skirts.

1064
01:20:27,705 --> 01:20:30,435
This time you've gone too far.
You're trapped.

1065
01:20:30,508 --> 01:20:32,032
They told me you were dangerous.

1066
01:20:32,110 --> 01:20:35,011
Perhaps the guillotine will amuse you, too.

1067
01:20:35,079 --> 01:20:36,273
The guillotine.

1068
01:20:36,347 --> 01:20:40,977
Little did l think that l, too,
would lose my head over Du Barry.

1069
01:20:41,052 --> 01:20:43,543
l trust my appearance pleases you.

1070
01:20:43,621 --> 01:20:45,521
l expected nothing.

1071
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:49,526
-l know the King's taste.
-Of which you do not approve.

1072
01:20:49,594 --> 01:20:52,791
-His Majesty can do as he wishes.
-How generous. l shall tell him.

1073
01:20:52,864 --> 01:20:56,664
So long as he doesn't rob his hungry
people to pay for your pretty feathers.

1074
01:20:56,734 --> 01:20:58,929
That is the blood of France.

1075
01:20:59,437 --> 01:21:02,406
We shall see if yours is as red tomorrow.

1076
01:21:08,613 --> 01:21:10,808
You can't call them, can you?

1077
01:21:11,783 --> 01:21:15,219
l've sworn to drive you out,
yet you're afraid to call them.

1078
01:21:15,286 --> 01:21:16,412
l am not afraid.

1079
01:21:16,487 --> 01:21:17,852
You know that if they kill me,

1080
01:21:17,922 --> 01:21:21,119
it ends the only excitement
in your dull, wretched existence.

1081
01:21:21,192 --> 01:21:23,023
Dull? Wretched?

1082
01:21:23,094 --> 01:21:26,222
You fool. l rule France. l have everything.

1083
01:21:27,699 --> 01:21:29,997
lt is l, madame, le capitaine.

1084
01:21:32,136 --> 01:21:33,535
Let them in.

1085
01:21:38,443 --> 01:21:39,671
l can't.

1086
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:44,443
lf you regret letting me escape,

1087
01:21:44,515 --> 01:21:47,348
tell them l'll be
at the Black Tavern tonight,

1088
01:21:47,418 --> 01:21:49,045
a secret meeting.

1089
01:21:52,056 --> 01:21:54,957
The password is, ''Down With Du Barry.''

1090
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:04,424
There he goes.

1091
01:22:11,242 --> 01:22:12,266
What happened?

1092
01:22:12,343 --> 01:22:14,834
The Black Arrow's escaped
from madame's boudoir.

1093
01:22:25,523 --> 01:22:27,320
-ls my palace that way?
-Yes, sire.

1094
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:47,409
Poison ivy.

1095
01:22:52,683 --> 01:22:53,775
Help!

1096
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:20,840
-Password?
-We are friends of the Black Arrow.

1097
01:23:20,912 --> 01:23:22,311
Password?

1098
01:23:24,315 --> 01:23:26,476
Down with Du Barry.

1099
01:23:26,551 --> 01:23:28,678
Oh, you are friends. Enter.

1100
01:23:47,638 --> 01:23:50,004
-All right, what'll it be?
-Champagne.

1101
01:23:50,074 --> 01:23:53,009
-Champagne?
-The champagne of the poor, beer.

1102
01:23:53,077 --> 01:23:55,204
-And stale bread.
-Yeah.

1103
01:24:00,318 --> 01:24:03,151
So these are my enemies,
the jealous dogs.

1104
01:24:03,221 --> 01:24:04,620
Not so loud.

1105
01:24:06,557 --> 01:24:10,323
Quiet. Quiet, fellows. Quiet. Quiet. Quiet.

1106
01:24:11,863 --> 01:24:14,832
Well, folks, it's great to be back again.

1107
01:24:14,899 --> 01:24:19,029
Glad to see so many loyal faces
in the audience.

1108
01:24:19,103 --> 01:24:22,095
And now,
without any further introduction,

1109
01:24:22,173 --> 01:24:25,904
l give you a man who comes
direct from the palace,

1110
01:24:25,977 --> 01:24:30,311
the star of our revolution,
your favorite and mine,

1111
01:24:30,381 --> 01:24:31,780
the Black Arrow.

1112
01:24:41,959 --> 01:24:44,985
Friends of freedom, foes of iniquity,

1113
01:24:45,062 --> 01:24:47,622
sons of liberty, arise.

1114
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,262
Not yet.

1115
01:24:51,102 --> 01:24:54,265
Why can you no longer
find bread for your babies?

1116
01:24:54,338 --> 01:24:56,602
Why is your barn empty of grain?

1117
01:24:56,674 --> 01:24:58,801
Why is your bottle empty of wine?

1118
01:24:58,876 --> 01:25:01,674
-ls it because of you?
-No.

1119
01:25:01,746 --> 01:25:04,510
-ls it because of him?
-No.

1120
01:25:04,582 --> 01:25:07,073
-ls it because of the King?
-No.

1121
01:25:07,151 --> 01:25:09,176
Yes.

1122
01:25:09,253 --> 01:25:12,620
Yes, the King. But is it your king?

1123
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:15,352
No, it's Madam Du Barry's king.

1124
01:25:17,328 --> 01:25:21,765
Du Barry, that jade, that Jezebel,
that spoiler of kings.

1125
01:25:21,832 --> 01:25:23,732
lsn't he wonderful?

1126
01:25:23,801 --> 01:25:25,735
Does she love the King?

1127
01:25:25,803 --> 01:25:30,137
No, she loves rubies
so your children go hungry.

1128
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:33,837
She loves silks and furs,
and your wives go naked.

1129
01:25:33,911 --> 01:25:35,344
Look at his eyes.

1130
01:25:35,413 --> 01:25:37,813
And who is this Du Barry?

1131
01:25:37,882 --> 01:25:39,543
She isn't a mother.

1132
01:25:40,318 --> 01:25:42,286
She isn't a wife.

1133
01:25:42,353 --> 01:25:44,378
She isn't even a woman.

1134
01:25:44,455 --> 01:25:48,152
Hurray! Hurray!

1135
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:51,923
She is only the friend,
the friend of the King

1136
01:25:51,996 --> 01:25:55,762
who taxes you, and taxes you,
and robs you.

1137
01:25:58,202 --> 01:26:01,262
He puts a heavy tax
on every penny that we make

1138
01:26:01,339 --> 01:26:03,307
lt's getting drastic!

1139
01:26:03,374 --> 01:26:05,569
lt's too fantastic

1140
01:26:05,643 --> 01:26:08,635
He robs our very ovens
of all the bread we bake

1141
01:26:08,713 --> 01:26:10,578
lt gets absurder

1142
01:26:10,648 --> 01:26:12,946
Hey, Jack, it's murder

1143
01:26:13,017 --> 01:26:16,817
And don't forget Du Barry
the royal beauty spot

1144
01:26:16,887 --> 01:26:20,323
What has that Du Barry got
that this poor thing has not?

1145
01:26:20,391 --> 01:26:24,020
She sits and drinks the best champagne
with others of her ilk

1146
01:26:24,095 --> 01:26:27,531
While this poor starving creature
can't get a glass of milk

1147
01:26:27,598 --> 01:26:29,259
Shall we stand for it?

1148
01:26:29,333 --> 01:26:31,096
No, we won't stand for it

1149
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:33,033
Then shall we rise to it?

1150
01:26:33,104 --> 01:26:35,334
Yes, we'll rise to it

1151
01:26:35,406 --> 01:26:37,271
Then gather sticks and gather stones

1152
01:26:37,341 --> 01:26:39,172
We're out to break his royal bones

1153
01:26:39,243 --> 01:26:41,143
Allons, enfants!

1154
01:26:41,212 --> 01:26:43,373
Allons!

1155
01:26:45,349 --> 01:26:49,251
Rise, rise, daughter and son

1156
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:50,787
Servants of France

1157
01:26:50,855 --> 01:26:53,221
There is work to be done

1158
01:26:53,291 --> 01:26:57,193
Fight, fight, throw off the glove

1159
01:26:57,261 --> 01:27:01,095
Fight for the country that we love

1160
01:27:01,165 --> 01:27:03,030
Up with the downtrodden

1161
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:05,034
Down with the uptrodden

1162
01:27:05,102 --> 01:27:09,004
Smash our way to victory

1163
01:27:09,073 --> 01:27:10,904
ln with the outbred

1164
01:27:10,975 --> 01:27:12,966
Out with the inbred

1165
01:27:13,044 --> 01:27:14,534
Might is right

1166
01:27:14,612 --> 01:27:16,375
So fight, fight, fight

1167
01:27:16,447 --> 01:27:20,781
To make a great democracy

1168
01:27:20,851 --> 01:27:24,878
Rise, rise, strike at the foe

1169
01:27:24,955 --> 01:27:28,857
Call out to arms from Calais to Bordeaux

1170
01:27:28,959 --> 01:27:30,824
Fight, fight

1171
01:27:30,895 --> 01:27:34,331
Fight for the chance of freedom

1172
01:27:34,398 --> 01:27:38,357
and glory for France

1173
01:27:40,071 --> 01:27:43,666
-He's mad about me.
-They're all mad, about you.

1174
01:27:43,741 --> 01:27:45,641
Come, we must warn the King.

1175
01:27:45,976 --> 01:27:47,603
We want the King.

1176
01:27:47,678 --> 01:27:49,339
We want the King.

1177
01:27:49,413 --> 01:27:51,176
We must save France.

1178
01:27:51,248 --> 01:27:53,045
We want the King.

1179
01:27:53,117 --> 01:27:54,846
We want the King.

1180
01:27:54,919 --> 01:27:56,819
We must save France.

1181
01:27:56,887 --> 01:27:58,548
We want the King.

1182
01:27:58,622 --> 01:28:00,590
We want the King.

1183
01:28:00,658 --> 01:28:02,455
We must save France.

1184
01:28:02,526 --> 01:28:04,289
-We want the King.
-Here l am, boys.

1185
01:28:04,362 --> 01:28:06,125
We want the King.

1186
01:28:06,197 --> 01:28:08,427
-We must save France.
-Here l am, boys.

1187
01:28:08,499 --> 01:28:11,161
-We want the King.
-France is saved.

1188
01:28:11,235 --> 01:28:12,862
You know, you fellows saved my life?

1189
01:28:12,937 --> 01:28:14,666
One for all and all for one.

1190
01:28:14,739 --> 01:28:17,264
-Are you with us?
-Am l with you? l'm one of you.

1191
01:28:17,341 --> 01:28:19,002
-Where you heading for, the palace?
-We are.

1192
01:28:19,076 --> 01:28:20,941
Good. When we get there,
l'll open a bottle of wine.

1193
01:28:21,011 --> 01:28:23,912
-We'll open all the wine.
-Yeah, what do l care?

1194
01:28:23,981 --> 01:28:27,382
-Hey, how about staying for dinner?
-We're all staying for dinner.

1195
01:28:27,451 --> 01:28:30,545
Sure. Well, l eat when you eat.
One for all and so forth.

1196
01:28:32,056 --> 01:28:33,990
Say, l don't see
the lights of the palace yet.

1197
01:28:34,058 --> 01:28:37,221
Palace? When we're through,
not one light will be left burning.

1198
01:28:37,294 --> 01:28:40,695
Oh, air-raid wardens, huh?
l'm a fire watcher, myself.

1199
01:28:40,765 --> 01:28:42,528
Hey, are you sure this is the right way?

1200
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:44,693
We'll get there. Just follow the Arrow.

1201
01:28:44,769 --> 01:28:46,964
-What Arrow?
-Our leader, the Black Arrow.

1202
01:28:47,037 --> 01:28:48,902
Oh, is he with us, too?

1203
01:28:48,973 --> 01:28:50,668
We want the King.

1204
01:28:50,741 --> 01:28:52,902
We must save France.

1205
01:28:52,977 --> 01:28:54,410
You said you were with us.

1206
01:28:54,478 --> 01:28:56,742
l'm with you, ain't l?
l was just taking a shortcut.

1207
01:28:56,814 --> 01:28:59,783
Traitor. He wants to get there first
so he can kill the King.

1208
01:28:59,850 --> 01:29:01,317
Oh, don't be silly.

1209
01:29:01,385 --> 01:29:03,649
When you kill the king,
l don't even want to be there.

1210
01:29:03,721 --> 01:29:05,518
We want the King.

1211
01:29:05,589 --> 01:29:06,988
We want the King.

1212
01:29:14,765 --> 01:29:16,232
Take cover!

1213
01:29:28,345 --> 01:29:31,041
So your followers must find a new leader.

1214
01:29:31,115 --> 01:29:33,743
Hang him to that tree.

1215
01:29:33,818 --> 01:29:35,445
Stop it. Stop it.

1216
01:29:35,519 --> 01:29:37,885
-Who dares interfere?
-Me.

1217
01:29:39,089 --> 01:29:40,954
My Majesty.

1218
01:29:41,025 --> 01:29:43,357
Your Majesty, how did you get here?

1219
01:29:43,427 --> 01:29:46,055
l've been out
feeling the pulse of the public.

1220
01:29:46,864 --> 01:29:50,231
Alec, l should have known it was you.

1221
01:29:50,301 --> 01:29:54,567
So you're the boudoir kibitzer
that's been trying to wreck my romance.

1222
01:29:55,539 --> 01:29:57,871
Well, that's why we captured him,
Your Majesty.

1223
01:29:57,942 --> 01:30:01,173
-Now, may l hang him?
-Sure. No.

1224
01:30:01,245 --> 01:30:04,271
What kind of a king
do you think l am, anyway?

1225
01:30:04,348 --> 01:30:08,148
We'll give him a fair trial,
and then we'll hang him.

1226
01:30:08,219 --> 01:30:09,481
And you, too.

1227
01:30:14,658 --> 01:30:19,652
-Your Majesty knows this scoundrel?
-Sure, l know him a long time from now.

1228
01:30:19,730 --> 01:30:21,220
l was going to give you a trial,

1229
01:30:21,298 --> 01:30:23,630
but my ministers said
it'd be just a waste of money.

1230
01:30:23,701 --> 01:30:26,864
-You're a fine one to talk about waste.
-Ain't l?

1231
01:30:28,339 --> 01:30:31,467
-Hey, what do l do now?
-Sentence them, Your Majesty.

1232
01:30:33,377 --> 01:30:37,837
''Whereas two lawless subjects
of His Royal Majesty...''

1233
01:30:37,915 --> 01:30:39,906
Hey, we may as well skip
the dull stuff, huh?

1234
01:30:39,984 --> 01:30:42,384
Yeah, just read the good part.

1235
01:30:43,254 --> 01:30:45,620
For parading without license,
each of you get 30 days.

1236
01:30:45,689 --> 01:30:47,987
And for planning to knock me off,
you get the guillotine.

1237
01:30:48,058 --> 01:30:49,525
Your Majesty.

1238
01:30:52,062 --> 01:30:54,030
l've decided to give you a break.

1239
01:30:54,098 --> 01:30:55,998
l'll cancel the 30 days.

1240
01:30:56,066 --> 01:30:58,296
To the Bastille. Prepare the guillotine.

1241
01:30:58,369 --> 01:31:00,997
Long live France. Long live Taliostra.

1242
01:31:01,071 --> 01:31:03,096
-Long live Louis.
-Down with Louis.

1243
01:31:03,173 --> 01:31:05,505
You can't talk to my pop like that.

1244
01:31:09,547 --> 01:31:13,347
Get it out! Get it out! Get it out!

1245
01:31:13,417 --> 01:31:15,578
Get it out, will you? Get it out!

1246
01:31:15,653 --> 01:31:17,917
Pull it out! Pull it out, will you?

1247
01:31:17,988 --> 01:31:20,183
Take it easy, sire,
the doctor will be here any minute.

1248
01:31:20,257 --> 01:31:22,782
He has a wonderful reputation.

1249
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:25,886
Never mind his reputation,
has he got a pair of pliers?

1250
01:31:25,963 --> 01:31:28,488
Oh, my little back. My little back.

1251
01:31:31,435 --> 01:31:33,630
-The doctor will be here any minute, sire.
-ls he any good?

1252
01:31:33,704 --> 01:31:36,229
He's the best backfield man
in all of France, sire.

1253
01:31:36,307 --> 01:31:38,775
-He'll have you on your feet in no time.
-Oh, that's...

1254
01:31:38,842 --> 01:31:42,107
l can get on my feet now.
When can l get on my back?

1255
01:31:42,179 --> 01:31:44,647
Here comes Dr. Pullitt now.

1256
01:31:44,715 --> 01:31:47,240
Good morning, good morning,
good morning.

1257
01:31:47,318 --> 01:31:50,446
l'm sorry to be late,
but l saved a man's life this morning.

1258
01:31:50,521 --> 01:31:52,682
He was sick and sent for me,
but l didn't go.

1259
01:31:52,756 --> 01:31:54,781
Now, what's troubling
my little man this morning?

1260
01:31:54,858 --> 01:31:58,225
l got a sharp pain in my back.
Guess what it is?

1261
01:31:58,295 --> 01:32:02,356
We'll find out. Stick out your tongue.
Further. Further. Further.

1262
01:32:02,433 --> 01:32:04,128
lt's hooked on back there.

1263
01:32:04,201 --> 01:32:06,032
What do you want me to do?
Lay it on the floor?

1264
01:32:06,103 --> 01:32:08,697
No, the floor is dirty.
How do you sleep at night?

1265
01:32:08,772 --> 01:32:12,003
Sometimes like this,
and then sometimes...

1266
01:32:12,076 --> 01:32:14,101
What do you care how l sleep?

1267
01:32:14,178 --> 01:32:15,475
Get that thing out, will you?

1268
01:32:15,546 --> 01:32:17,673
lt's been picking up
radio programs all day.

1269
01:32:17,748 --> 01:32:19,773
That's it. Liver. lt's your liver, all right.

1270
01:32:19,850 --> 01:32:22,114
lf it is, it's protruding.

1271
01:32:22,186 --> 01:32:24,654
Just as l thought,
too many white corpuscles.

1272
01:32:24,722 --> 01:32:26,622
Dye them, brother, dye them.

1273
01:32:26,690 --> 01:32:30,057
-Now, when did you feel this coming on?
-l didn't. lt kind of snuck up on me.

1274
01:32:30,127 --> 01:32:33,722
-Well, don t worry. We'll pull through.
-Yeah, l might, but you won't.

1275
01:32:33,797 --> 01:32:35,788
Here, take one of these morning and night.

1276
01:32:35,866 --> 01:32:38,562
What do you think l am,
a pinball machine?

1277
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:40,900
What about that jumbo splinter?

1278
01:32:40,971 --> 01:32:42,233
Oh, that.

1279
01:32:43,507 --> 01:32:44,735
That's nothing.

1280
01:32:44,808 --> 01:32:47,868
-A little anemic, too.
-What'll l do now?

1281
01:32:47,945 --> 01:32:49,469
Just put a beefsteak on it.

1282
01:32:49,813 --> 01:32:50,802
Beefsteak?

1283
01:33:08,165 --> 01:33:11,134
Be brave, my friend.
You are dying for your country.

1284
01:33:11,201 --> 01:33:13,999
Yeah, but l was born in the city.

1285
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:19,168
Louis, stop it. Stop it, you must stop it.

1286
01:33:19,243 --> 01:33:21,837
l'm not doing anything.
Hey, what are you doing here?

1287
01:33:21,912 --> 01:33:24,312
Louis, l implore you. Please save his life.

1288
01:33:24,381 --> 01:33:27,077
Who, the Black Arrow? Why?

1289
01:33:29,453 --> 01:33:31,182
Because l love him.

1290
01:33:33,957 --> 01:33:35,356
l don't get it.

1291
01:33:35,426 --> 01:33:38,918
Here l've been squandering jewels
and palaces on you.

1292
01:33:38,996 --> 01:33:41,521
All the time he's been plotting
against the both of us,

1293
01:33:41,598 --> 01:33:43,156
and you fall for him.

1294
01:33:43,233 --> 01:33:45,360
l can't help it. l love him.

1295
01:33:45,436 --> 01:33:48,872
What's he got that l wish l had,
and how can l get it?

1296
01:33:56,013 --> 01:33:59,005
Get your daily chopping guide here.
Get a program.

1297
01:33:59,083 --> 01:34:01,745
You can't tell which head is which
without a program.

1298
01:34:01,819 --> 01:34:04,447
Get your daily chopping guide.
Get a program.

1299
01:34:05,589 --> 01:34:09,218
-Oh, hurry, Louis, there's no time to lose.
-l can't do it.

1300
01:34:09,293 --> 01:34:12,285
lf l pardon him, l'm left holding the bag,
while he's holding you.

1301
01:34:12,362 --> 01:34:15,024
Oh, if you spare his life,
l swear l'll never see him again.

1302
01:34:15,099 --> 01:34:18,933
-Oh, gonna meet him in the dark, huh?
-Oh, please, Louis, let him live.

1303
01:34:19,002 --> 01:34:21,493
l'll do anything you want.

1304
01:34:21,572 --> 01:34:23,904
-All right, l'll do it.
-Oh, thank you, Louis.

1305
01:34:23,974 --> 01:34:25,999
But 200 years from now,
history books will say,

1306
01:34:26,076 --> 01:34:27,668
''King Louis was screwy.''

1307
01:34:27,745 --> 01:34:31,909
-Quick. The knife'll drop in a minute.
-l'll save him if it takes a week.

1308
01:34:32,549 --> 01:34:34,483
One moment, sire.

1309
01:34:34,551 --> 01:34:35,813
Yes?

1310
01:34:37,654 --> 01:34:40,088
Eave-drooping, huh?

1311
01:34:40,157 --> 01:34:44,253
l would rather the little affair
went on just as scheduled.

1312
01:34:44,328 --> 01:34:47,456
But l've got to save the Black Arrow.
Du Barry may kill herself.

1313
01:34:47,531 --> 01:34:50,864
Let her. lf l can't have her, no one else will.

1314
01:34:50,934 --> 01:34:52,526
Now, wait a minute, bub.

1315
01:34:52,603 --> 01:34:55,231
You're talking to My Majesty,
King of France.

1316
01:34:55,305 --> 01:34:57,637
And you're talking
to the best swordsman in Europe.

1317
01:34:57,708 --> 01:34:58,970
En garde.

1318
01:35:05,916 --> 01:35:07,178
En garde.

1319
01:35:11,855 --> 01:35:13,550
Well, what do you...

1320
01:35:19,830 --> 01:35:23,129
Darling, do not lose courage.
Wait, the King is coming to free him.

1321
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:25,691
Please. Please, hear me.
The King says he shall live.

1322
01:35:32,342 --> 01:35:35,675
You know, a thing like this
is liable to stunt your growth.

1323
01:36:03,207 --> 01:36:05,471
Help! Help!

1324
01:36:05,542 --> 01:36:07,908
Stop it! Stop it!

1325
01:36:07,978 --> 01:36:11,106
Help! Stop it! Stop it!

1326
01:36:11,949 --> 01:36:14,315
Help! Help!

1327
01:36:14,384 --> 01:36:16,682
Stop it! Stop it!

1328
01:36:17,621 --> 01:36:19,816
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

1329
01:36:19,890 --> 01:36:23,553
That's okay.
He's lapsing back to abnormal now.

1330
01:36:23,627 --> 01:36:26,323
Grab him. Grab him. He's trying to kill me.

1331
01:36:26,396 --> 01:36:28,261
Why, what's the matter with you, Louis?

1332
01:36:28,332 --> 01:36:30,698
Don't you know me? l'm Willie.

1333
01:36:30,767 --> 01:36:33,395
You are? What happened?

1334
01:36:33,470 --> 01:36:36,064
That mickey you got
must have been tainted.

1335
01:36:36,740 --> 01:36:39,300
Hey, where have l been?
Right here in my arms.

1336
01:36:39,376 --> 01:36:40,843
No wonder l had a nightmare.

1337
01:36:40,911 --> 01:36:44,244
-Here, have a drink.
-No, thank you. Oh, no.

1338
01:36:44,314 --> 01:36:47,772
The last drink you gave me
set me back 200 years.

1339
01:36:47,851 --> 01:36:49,409
Oh, what a dream l had.

1340
01:36:49,486 --> 01:36:52,819
l dreamed l was
the greatest lover in all France.

1341
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:55,620
But, folks,
l want you to meet the real champ.

1342
01:36:55,692 --> 01:36:58,627
-Louis, you're a prince.
-l used to be a king.

1343
01:36:58,695 --> 01:37:00,788
-You still are, Louis.
-Nah.

1344
01:37:00,864 --> 01:37:04,129
l found out you can't buy love. l know.

1345

But l can buy you kids a wedding present.

$10,000.

1347
01:37:08,939 --> 01:37:11,669
Oh, no, Louis.
Thanks, but you hold onto it.

No, l got plenty left.

1349
01:37:12,943 --> 01:37:15,571
l only bought a ring,
a car and some war bonds.

1350
01:37:15,646 --> 01:37:17,443
No, we want to start out broke, Louis.

1351
01:37:17,514 --> 01:37:19,709
Then anything that happens to us
will be an improvement.

1352
01:37:19,783 --> 01:37:21,580

l'm from the lncome Tax Department.

1355
01:37:28,091 --> 01:37:31,060
This will just about cover
the tax you owe on your winnings.

1356
01:37:31,128 --> 01:37:33,358
Suppose l take it now.
lt'll save you a stamp.

1357
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:36,490
-Well, wait a...
-Of course, there's still the state tax.

1358
01:37:36,566 --> 01:37:39,467
-You'll have to sell your car to cover that.
-Oh.

1359
01:37:39,536 --> 01:37:41,766
There, sir, is your receipt.

1360
01:37:41,838 --> 01:37:46,366
-Well, at least l got a nickel left.
-Oh, hoarding, eh?

1361
01:37:58,488 --> 01:37:59,750
Louis, you can use this now.

1362
01:37:59,823 --> 01:38:01,518
No, no, that's a friendship ring,

1363
01:38:01,591 --> 01:38:04,025
and nothing's ever
gonna break up our friendship.

1364
01:38:04,094 --> 01:38:07,461
