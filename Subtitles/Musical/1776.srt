1
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,946
Mr. Adams!

2
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,246
Mr. Adams!

3
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,684
Mr. Adams!

4
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:39,487
There you are.
Didn't you hear me call you, Mr. Adams?

5
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:43,757
You could've shouted down something,
saved me climbing up four flights.

6
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,129
A man that likes to talk
as much as you do, I'd think...

7
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:51,994
What do you keep coming
up here for, Mr. Adams?

8
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:54,596
Afraid someone's
going to steal our bell?

9
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,609
Well, don't worry.

10
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:01,169
Been here more than 14 years
and ain't been carried off once.

11
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,942
Better get yourself
back down to Congress, Mr. Adams.

12
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,989
Getting ready to vote,
and they said...

13
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:12,024
they couldn't settle
such an important question...

14
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,457
without Massachusetts
being there.

15
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,261
I can just imagine.

16
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:27,304
All right, what burning issue
are we voting on this time?

17
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:31,309
On whether or not to grant
General Washington's request...

18
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,710
that all members of the Rhode Island
militia be required...

19
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:37,045
to wear matching uniforms.

20
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,275
Oh, good God.

21
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:21,726
I have come to the conclusion
that one useless man...

22
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,160
is called a disgrace...

23
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,030
that two are called
a law firm...

24
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:32,595
and that three or more
become a Congress.

25
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:36,164
And by God,
I have had this Congress.

26
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:39,302
For ten years,
King George and his parliament...

27
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,782
have gulled, cullied and diddled these
colonies with their illegal taxes...

28
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:48,082
Stamp Acts, Townshend Acts,
Sugar Acts, Tea Acts.

29
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,679
And when we dared
stand up like men...

30
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,851
they have stopped our trade,
seized our ships...

31
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:56,827
blockaded our ports,
burned our towns...

32
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,262
and spilled our blood.

33
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:04,827
And still this Congress refuses to grant
any of my proposals on independence...

34
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:08,237
even so much as the courtesy
of open debate.

35
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,573
Good God, what in the hell
are you waiting for?

36
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:15,544
<i>Sit down, John</i>
<i>Sit down, John</i>

37
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:19,244
- Thomas, for God's sake, listen to me.
- <i>For God's sake, John, sit down</i>

38
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,253
- <i>Sit down, John</i>
- I've had enough of you.

39
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:25,257
<i>Sit down, John</i>
<i>For God's sake, John, sit down</i>

40
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,259
- Now, listen...
- <i>Why not open up a window</i>

41
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,319
- Listen to me and forget the window.
- <i>It's 90 degrees</i>

42
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,193
<i>Have mercy, John, please</i>

43
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,597
<i>It's hot as hell</i>
<i>in Philadelphia</i>

44
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,158
<i>Someone ought</i>
<i>to open up a window</i>

45
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,727
<i>I say vote yes</i>

46
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,637
<i>Vote yes</i>

47
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,903
<i>Vote for independency</i>

48
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,570
<i>Someone ought</i>
<i>to open up a window</i>

49
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,841
<i>I say vote yes</i>

50
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,849
<i>Sit down, John</i>

51
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,908
<i>Vote for independency</i>

52
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:56,477
<i>Someone ought</i>
<i>to open up a window</i>

53
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,855
<i>Too many flies</i>
<i>Too many flies</i>

54
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,554
<i>But it's hot as hell</i>
<i>in Philadelphia</i>

55
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:06,689
- <i>Are you gonna open up a window</i>
- <i>Can't we compromise here</i>

56
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,131
<i>Vote yes</i>

57
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,362
<i>No, too many flies here</i>

58
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:11,869
<i>Vote yes</i>

59
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,668
<i>Oh, for God's sake, John</i>
<i>sit down</i>

60
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,232
Good God.
Consider yourselves fortunate...

61
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,576
that you haveJohn Adams to abuse,
for no sane man would tolerate it.

62
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:25,174
<i>John, you're a bore</i>
<i>We've heard this before</i>

63
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,651
<i>Now, for God's sake, John</i>
<i>sit down</i>

64
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,153
<i>I say vote yes</i>

65
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,180
<i>Vote yes</i>

66
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,086
<i>Vote for independency</i>

67
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,128
<i>Someone ought</i>
<i>to open up a window</i>

68
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,922
<i>I say vote yes</i>

69
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:41,262
<i>Sit down, John</i>

70
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,768
<i>Vote for independency</i>

71
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:46,361
<i>Will someone shut that man up</i>

72
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,031
Never!

73
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,099
Never!

74
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,808
Dear God.

75
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:02,446
For one solid year they have
been sitting here a whole year...

76
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,752
doing nothing.

77
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:10,285
<i>I do believe you've laid a curse</i>
<i>on North America</i>

78
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:15,266
<i>A curse that we here now rehearse</i>
<i>in Philadelphia</i>

79
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,565
<i>A second flood</i>
<i>a simple famine</i>

80
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,606
<i>Plagues of locusts</i>
<i>everywhere</i>

81
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:24,734
<i>Or a cataclysmic earthquake</i>
<i>I'd accept with some despair</i>

82
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:28,440
<i>But no</i>
<i>you've sent us Congress</i>

83
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:32,814
<i>Good God, sir, was that fair</i>

84
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:37,054
<i>You see, we piddle</i>
<i>twiddle and resolve</i>

85
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,057
<i>Not one damn thing</i>
<i>do we solve</i>

86
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,150
<i>Piddle, twiddle and resolve</i>

87
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,990
<i>Nothing's ever solved</i>

88
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:46,793
<i>In foul, fetid, fuming</i>
<i>foggy, filthy</i>

89
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,266
<i>Philadelphia</i>

90
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:53,169
<i>Someone ought</i>
<i>to open up a window</i>

91
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:56,436
- Oh, good God.
- <i>John, John</i>

92
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:01,606
<i>Is that you carrying on, John</i>

93
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:06,209
Oh, Abigail, Abigail, I have such
a desire to knock heads together.

94
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,810
<i>Then why in heaven's name</i>
<i>do you stay there?</i>

95
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:12,346
<i>Come home to Boston, John.</i>
<i>It's only 300 miles.</i>

96
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:15,019
<i>If you left tonight,</i>
<i>you could be here in only eight days.</i>

97
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:17,028
<i>How can I do that, Abigail?</i>

98
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:20,623
<i>I'm no further along now</i>
<i>than I was when I first came here.</i>

99
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,895
I know, my dearest. I know.

100
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,767
But that's because you make
everything so complicated.

101
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,772
It's all quite simple, really.

102
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,934
<i>Just tell the Congress</i>
<i>to declare</i>

103
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,605
<i>Independency</i>

104
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,875
<i>Then sign your name</i>
<i>get out of there</i>

105
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:40,544
<i>And hurry home to me</i>

106
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,054
<i>Our children</i>
<i>all have dysentery</i>

107
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:45,454
<i>Little Tom</i>
<i>keeps turning blue</i>

108
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:49,655
<i>Little Abby has the measles</i>
<i>and I'm coming down with flu</i>

109
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,892
<i>They say we may get smallpox</i>

110
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,695
Madam, what else is new?

111
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,863
Abigail, in my last letter,
I wrote you...

112
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:05,536
that the king had collected 12,000
German mercenaries to send against us.

113
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:10,105
I asked you to organize the ladies
to make saltpeter for gunpowder.

114
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:13,117
- Now, have you done as I asked?
- No, John, I have not.

115
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:14,743
Well, why have you not?

116
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,085
Because you neglected to tell us
how saltpeter is made.

117
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:21,991
By treating sodium nitrate
with potassium chloride, of course.

118
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,621
- Oh, yes, of course.
- Will it be done, then?

119
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:27,598
John, I'm afraid we have
a more urgent problem.

120
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,259
More urgent, madam?

121
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:35,672
<i>There's one thing every woman's missed</i>
<i>in Massachusetts Bay</i>

122
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,403
<i>Don't smirk at me</i>
<i>you egotist</i>

123
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:42,243
<i>Pay heed to what I say</i>

124
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:46,684
<i>We've gone from Framingham to Boston</i>
<i>and we cannot find a pin</i>

125
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:51,320
'<i>'Don't you know there's a war on"</i>
<i>says the tradesman with a grin</i>

126
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:55,759
<i>Well, we will</i>
<i>not make saltpeter</i>

127
00:09:55,828 --> 00:10:00,231
<i>Until you send us pins</i>

128
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,494
Pins, madam? Saltpeter.

129
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,468
- Pins.
- Saltpeter.

130
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,562
- Pins.
- Saltpeter.

131
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,004
- Pins.
- Saltpeter.

132
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,634
- Pins. Pins. Pins.
- 'Peter. 'Peter. 'Peter.

133
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,849
Done, madam, done.

134
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,579
Done, John.

135
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:24,180
- Hurry home, John.
- As soon as I'm able.

136
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,190
Don't stop writing.
It's all I have.

137
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,453
Every day, my dearest friend.

138
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,096
<i>Till then</i>

139
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,862
<i>Till then</i>

140
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:40,099
<i>I am</i>

141
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:43,573
<i>As I ever was</i>

142
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:48,273
<i>And ever shall be</i>

143
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,577
<i>Yours</i>

144
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,675
<i>Yours</i>

145
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,220
<i>Yours</i>

146
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:57,448
<i>Yours</i>

147
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:00,617
<i>Yours</i>

148
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,924
<i>Saltpeter</i>

149
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,762
<i>John</i>

150
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,425
<i>Pins</i>

151
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:16,134
<i>Abigail</i>

152
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,733
<i>For God's sake, John</i>

153
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,745
<i>Sit down</i>

154
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:36,885
Franklin!

155
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,631
Franklin!

156
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,235
Where in hell are you?

157
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:51,436
I see you hiding behind that tree.
It won't do you any good.

158
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:55,411
Damn it, this is no time
for playing games.

159
00:11:57,016 --> 00:12:00,417
Franklin, I have been looking
everywhere for you.

160
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,613
Where in God's name
have you been?

161
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:05,714
Right here, John,
being preserved for posterity.

162
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,089
Do you like it?

163
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,456
- It stinks.
- As ever, the soul of tact.

164
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:18,663
- Well, the man's no Botticelli.
- And the subject's no Venus.

165
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,968
Where were you last night
when I needed you?

166
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,974
You should have heard
what I suffered in there.

167
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:26,307
I heard, all right,
along with the rest of Philadelphia.

168
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,312
Lord, your voice
is piercing, John.

169
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,406
Well, I wish to heaven
my arguments were.

170
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:34,851
My God, Franklin, when are they
going to make up their minds?

171
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,945
With one hand
they can raise an army

172
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:40,981
dispatch one of their own to lead it
and cheer the news from Bunker's Hill...

173
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,927
and with the other,
they wave the olive branch...

174
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,965
begging the king for a happy
and permanent reconciliation.

175
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,694
Fat George has declared us
in rebellion.

176
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,704
- Why in bloody hell can't they?
- John, really.

177
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,831
You talk as if independence
were the rule.

178
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,841
It's never been done before.

179
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:00,003
No colony has ever broken from the
parent stem in the history of the world.

180
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,014
Damn it, Franklin,
you make us sound treasonous.

181
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:06,916
Do I? Treason, eh?

182
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,511
"Treason is a charge
invented by winners...

183
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,522
as an excuse
for hanging the losers."

184
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,821
I have more to do than stand here
listening to you quote yourself.

185
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:17,158
No, that was a new one.

186
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,493
Damn it, Franklin,
we're at war.

187
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,533
To defend ourselves,
nothing more.

188
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,932
We expressed our displeasure,
the English moved against us...

189
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,937
and we in turn have resisted.

190
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,633
Now our fellow congressmen
want to effect a reconciliation...

191
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:31,403
- before it becomes a war.
- Reconciliation, my ass.

192
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,604
The people want independence.

193
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,613
The people have read
Mr. Paine's "Common Sense."

194
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:39,447
- I doubt very much Congress has.
- That's true.

195
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,452
John, why don't you give it up?

196
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,149
Nobody listens to you.
You're obnoxious and disliked.

197
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:48,682
I'm not promoting John Adams.
I'm promoting independence.

198
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,025
Evidently, they cannot
help connecting the two.

199
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,462
Even your own cousin.

200
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:56,000
And if Sam Adams can't put up
with you, nobody can.

201
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,504
You're getting at something.

202
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,538
How can you tell?

203
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:06,738
All right, out with it, Franklin.
What new intrigue are you cooking up?

204
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:10,646
Let someone else
in Congress propose.

205
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,149
Never!

206
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,922
Why? Who did you have in mind?

207
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:25,828
I don't know.
I really haven't given it much thought.

208
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:29,331
You sent for me, Benjamin?

209
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:32,598
- Never.
- Hello, Johnny!

210
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:33,660
Richard.

211
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:36,606
Johnny and I need some advice.

212
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:40,076
- If it's mine to give, it's yours.
- Thank you, Richard.

213
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:43,637
The cause that we support
has come to a complete standstill.

214
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,650
- Why do you suppose that is?
- Simple.

215
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,312
- Johnny here is obnoxious and disliked.
- That's true.

216
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,321
What's the solution, I wonder?

217
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:55,018
Get somebody else
in Congress to propose.

218
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:58,063
Oh, Richard, that's brilliant.
Wasn't that brilliant, John?

219
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,224
- Brilliant.
- The question remains who can it be.

220
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,393
The man that we need
must belong to a delegation...

221
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,437
publicly committed
to support independence.

222
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:08,098
At the present time, only Massachusetts,
New Hampshire and Delaware...

223
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:11,370
- have declared our way.
- And Virginia. Don't forget Virginia.

224
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:13,377
Richard, I haven't.
How could I?

225
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,312
But strictly speaking, while Virginia's
views on independence are well known...

226
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,374
your legislature in Williamsburg
has never formerly authorized...

227
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:22,318
its delegation here in Congress
to support the cause.

228
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:26,017
If we could think of a Virginian with
enough influence to go down there...

229
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:30,926
- and persuade the House of Burgesses...
- I've thought of someone!

230
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,157
- Who?
- Me.

231
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:36,429
- Well, why didn't I think of that?
- I'll leave tonight.

232
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:39,062
Why, hell, I'll leave right now,
if you like.

233
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:42,130
I'll just stop off in Stratford
long enough to refresh the missus...

234
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,607
and then straight to the matter.

235
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,578
Yes, sir, I really have to compliment
you on your judgment, Johnny.

236
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,079
Whoa, boy. Steady.

237
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,742
You've come to the one colony
that can get the job done.

238
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:55,309
Virginia, the land that gave us
our glorious commander-in-chief...

239
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:57,517
George Washington...

240
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,581
will now give the continent
its proposal on independence.

241
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:04,117
And when Virginia proposes,
the South is bound to follow.

242
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:07,632
And where the South goes,
the middle colonies go.

243
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,861
Gentlemen, a salute.

244
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:13,496
To Virginia,
the mother of American independence.

245
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,871
Incredible. We're free
and he hasn't even left yet.

246
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:19,376
What makes you so sure
you can do it?

247
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:24,773
<i>My name is Richard Henry Lee</i>
<i>Virginia is my home</i>

248
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:30,220
<i>My name is Richard Henry Lee</i>
<i>Virginia is my home</i>

249
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:34,726
<i>And may my horses turn to glue</i>
<i>if I can't deliver up to you</i>

250
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:39,025
<i>The resolution</i>
<i>on independency</i>

251
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:41,566
<i>For I am FFV</i>

252
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,260
<i>The first family</i>

253
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:47,237
<i>in the sovereign colony</i>

254
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,706
<i>Yes, the FFV</i>

255
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,572
<i>The oldest family</i>

256
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:55,602
<i>In the oldest colony in America</i>

257
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,911
<i>And may the British</i>
<i>burn my land</i>

258
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,951
<i>If I can't deliver</i>
<i>to your hand</i>

259
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,546
<i>A resolution on independency</i>

260
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:06,591
<i>You see, it's here a Lee</i>
<i>there a Lee</i>

261
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,626
<i>And everywhere a Lee, Lee</i>

262
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,683
- <i>Social</i>
- <i>Lee</i>

263
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:10,694
- <i>Political</i>
- <i>Lee</i>

264
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,754
- <i>Financial, natural</i>
- <i>Lee, Lee</i>

265
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,765
- <i>Internal, external</i>
- <i>Lee, Lee</i>

266
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:15,765
- <i>Fraternal</i>
- <i>Lee</i>

267
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,096
- <i>Eternal</i>
- <i>Lee</i>

268
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,069
<i>The FFV</i>

269
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:20,867
<i>The first family</i>

00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,636
<i>In the sovereign colony</i>

00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,974
<i>And may my wife</i>

272
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,014
<i>If I can't deliver</i>
<i>as I said</i>

273
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:32,778
<i>A resolution on independency</i>

274
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:35,718
Spoken modest-Lee.
God help us.

275
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,779
Oh, he will, John.
He will.

276
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:41,314
<i>They say that God in heaven</i>
<i>is everybody's God</i>

277
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,861
- <i>Amen</i>
- <i>I'll admit that God in heaven</i>

278
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:47,695
<i>Is everybody's God</i>

279
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:50,166
<i>But I tell you, John</i>
<i>with pride</i>

280
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,568
<i>God leans a little</i>
<i>on the side of the Lees</i>

281
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,233
<i>The Lees of old Virginia</i>

282
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,708
<i>You see, it's here a Lee</i>
<i>there a Lee</i>

283
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:01,041
<i>And everywhere a Lee, a Lee</i>

284
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:04,310
<i>Here a Lee, there a Lee</i>
<i>and everywhere a Lee</i>

285
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,181
<i>Look out, there's Arthur Lee</i>
<i>Bobby Lee</i>

286
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,379
<i>General Lighthorse Harry Lee</i>

287
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,218
<i>Willie Lee, Jesse Lee</i>

288
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,121
- <i>And Richard H.</i>
- That's me.

289
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,958
<i>And may my blood</i>
<i>stop running blue</i>

290
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:22,194
<i>If I can't deliver up to you</i>
<i>the resolution on independency</i>

291
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,498
<i>Yes, sir, my God</i>
<i>it's here a Lee, there a Lee</i>

292
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,596
Come on, boys!
Join in with me!

293
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:30,369
- <i>Here a Lee, there a Lee</i>
- When do you leave?

294
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,704
<i>Immediate-Lee</i>

295
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,644
- <i>Here a Lee, there a Lee</i>
- When will you return?

296
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:35,839
<i>Short-Lee</i>

297
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:39,680
<i>Here a Lee, there a Lee</i>
<i>and I'll come back triumphant-Lee</i>

298
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:44,085
<i>Here a Lee, there a Lee</i>
<i>everywhere a Lee, a Lee</i>

299
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,522
<i>Forward</i>

300
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:52,189
<i>On</i>

301
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:26,090
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

302
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,965
I'm Dr. Lyman Hall,
the new delegate from Georgia.

303
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:33,163
I'm Andrew McNair,
congressional custodian.

304
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:36,298
If you'll be wanting anything at all,
just holler out "McNair"...

305
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:40,471
as all the others do
and there won't be too long to wait.

306
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:43,379
Where does the Georgia
delegation belong?

307
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:47,407
They mill about over in that corner
near the two Carolinas.

308
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,217
It's after 10:00.

309
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,387
I was told Congress
convenes at ten.

310
00:19:57,462 --> 00:20:00,488
Well, they'll be wandering in
any time now, sir...

311
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:02,796
with Old Grape 'n Guts
leading the pack.

312
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,768
- Old who?
- McNair!

313
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,428
Grape 'N Guts.

314
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,268
'Nair!

315
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,831
Fetch me a rum.

316
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:14,970
Mr. Hopkins, you'll be pleased
to meet Dr. Lyman Hall.

317
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,282
I don't need a doctor, damn it.

318
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,511
New delegate from Georgia.

319
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:23,487
Well, why didn't you say so?

320
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:27,457
I'm Stephen Hopkins,
old delegate from Rhode Island.

321
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:31,758
- McNair, fetch two rums.
- I fear it's a little early in the day.

322
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,760
Nonsense.

323
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:39,861
It's a medicinal fact that rum gets
a man's heart started in the morning.

324
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:43,770
I'm surprised
you didn't know that.

325
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:46,640
Speaking as the oldest man in the
Congress, I can tell you right now...

326
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:49,510
Ben Franklin is older
by almost a year.

327
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,014
Rum!

328
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,721
Tell me, Doctor.

329
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,952
Where does Georgia stand
on the question of independence?

330
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:03,460
With South Carolina, of course.

331
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,961
Needy, good morning.

332
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:09,467
Neddy, come over here and shake
the hand of Dr. Lyman Hall of Georgia.

333
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:12,765
Dr. Hall, this here
is Edward Rutledge from...

334
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,772
whichever Carolina
he says he's from.

335
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,502
- God knows I can't keep 'em straight.
- It's a pleasure, Dr. Hall.

336
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,340
- Your servant, Mr. Rutledge.
- You've met the long and the short...

337
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,674
of it now, Doctor.

338
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:24,477
Neddy here is just a lad.
He's the youngest of us.

339
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:27,177
- Except for Ben Franklin.
- McNair!

340
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:28,947
Your rum!

341
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,888
Where did you go
for it, man? Jamaica?

342
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:34,749
Well, now, come along,
Dr. Hall.

343
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:38,284
I know you must be anxious
to meet your colleagues from the South.

344
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,791
Doctor, may I present
to you Joseph Hewes.

345
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:45,336
This is Dr. Lyman Hall,
the new delegate from Georgia.

346
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:48,737
- An honor and a pleasure, gentlemen.
- Where do you stand on independence?

347
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,469
I'm here without
instructions, Mr. Hewes...

348
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:55,070
able to vote
my own personal convictions.

349
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,911
And they are?

350
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,381
Personal.

351
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:05,246
Now, Dr. Hall...

352
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,191
the Deep South
speaks with one voice.

353
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,591
It's traditional.

354
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,926
Even more, it is historical.

355
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,523
Enter Delaware.

356
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:21,600
Speak plain, Rutledge. You know I can't
follow a word of your damn French.

357
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,607
It's Latin, Colonel McKean...

358
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:27,338
a tribute to the eternal peace
and harmony of the Delaware delegation.

359
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:30,347
What are you saying, man?
You know perfectly well...

360
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:33,612
that neither Rodney nor I can stand
the sight of this louse.

361
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,812
- Now, Thomas...
- Gentlemen, please.

362
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:40,017
This is Dr. Lyman Hall
of Georgia.

363
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,083
- Caesar Rodney.
- An honor, sir.

364
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,789
- George Read and Colonel Thomas McKean.
- Your servant.

365
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:46,956
Dr. Hall.

366
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,433
I wonder if I might speak
to you for a moment in private.

367
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:51,662
By all means.

368
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:57,602
- McNair!
- I'm coming! I'm coming!

369
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:00,201
Help me. I'm stuck.

370
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,049
Tell me, sir.

371
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:09,884
Would you be
a doctor of medicine or theology?

372
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:12,617
Both, Mr. Rodney.
Which one can be of service?

373
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,353
By all means,
the physician first.

374
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:18,692
Then we shall see
about the other.

375
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:21,255
I shall call at your convenience.

376
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:33,141
I trust, Caesar,
when you're through converting...

377
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:35,145
the poor fellow
to independency...

378
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:37,738
that you'll give the opposition
a fair crack at him.

379
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:41,582
You're too late, John.

380
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:44,281
Once I get them, they're got.

381
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:49,225
Dr. Lyman Hall of Georgia,
Mr. John Dickinson of Pennsylvania.

382
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:51,888
- An honor, sir.
- Your servant, sir.

383
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:54,397
Tell me, Doctor.

384
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:57,560
- Where do you stand on the question of...
- Independence?

385
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,001
Treason.

386
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,239
I've no stomach for it.

387
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:06,106
Then be careful not to dine
with John Adams.

388
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,112
Between the fish
and the souffle...

389
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,580
You'll find yourself
hanging from an English rope.

390
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:12,082
Your servant, sir.

391
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,848
Judge Wilson, forgive me,
but how can anyone see you...

392
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:25,022
if you insist on standing
in Mr. Dickinson's shadow?

393
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:29,055
James Wilson,
also of Pennsylvania.

394
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,364
Sir.

395
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,870
An honor, sir.

396
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,873
Good morning. Good morning.

397
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,937
Good morning, ladies.
Good morning.

398
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:43,913
Steady, steady.

399
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,712
Make gangway, sir.
Make gangway!

400
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,253
Good morning, Mr. Wilson.
Good morning.

401
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,620
Watch where you're going.
Over there.

402
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:58,152
McNair, get me out of this thing.
Watch out for my foot.

403
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,131
- Good morning, all.
- Morning, Ben.

404
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:04,726
Here you are. Two coppers apiece.
Now, straight back to jail with you.

405
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:06,862
- Good morning, Stephen.
- Hi, Benjamin.

406
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:16,236
What are you staring at? Haven't
you ever seen a great man before?

407
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:18,612
Good Lord, sir, do you have
the honor to be Dr. Franklin?

408
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:22,744
Yes, I have that honor. Unfortunately,
the gout accompanies that honor.

409
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:24,311
Been living
too high again, pappy?

410
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:28,325
Oh, Stephen, I only wish King George
felt like my big toe all over.

411
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:33,795
McNair! Fetch a pillow
and two more rums.

412
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,629
Franklin, where's that idiot Lee?
Is he back yet? I don't see him.

413
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,670
Softly, John.
Your voice is hurting my foot.

414
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:43,504
One more day. That's how long
I'll remain silent, not a minute longer.

415
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:46,169
That strutting popinjay
was so damn sure of himself...

416
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:48,439
he's had time to bring back
a dozen proposals by now.

417
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:52,540
Tell me, James. How do you explain
the strange, monumental quietude...

418
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:55,552
that Congress has been treated to
these past 30 days?

419
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,852
Has the ill wind of independence
finally blown itself out?

420
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:01,859
Well, if you ask me...

421
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:05,727
For myself, I must confess that
a month free from New England noise...

422
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:07,822
is more therapeutic
than a month in the country.

423
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,629
- Don't you agree, James?
- Well, I feel...

424
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,636
Mr. Adams, pray look
for your voice, sir.

425
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:17,732
It cannot be far, and God knows we need
the entertainment in this Congress.

426
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:24,976
Congratulations. You just made your
greatest contribution to independence.

427
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,712
- You kept your flap shut.
- One more day, Franklin...

428
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:30,084
then I shall do the proposing.

429
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:35,252
Gentlemen, the usual
morning festivities concluded...

430
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:38,057
I will now call Congress
to order.

431
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:40,063
Mr. Thomson...

432
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:46,927
Second Continental Congress, meeting
in Philadelphia, is now in session.

433
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:50,372
Seven, June, 1776,
the 380th meeting.

434
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,376
SweetJesus!

435
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:57,177
The HonorableJohn Hancock
of Massachusetts Bay, president.

436
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:02,111
Thank you, Mr. Thomson.
Mr. McNair...

437
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:05,782
the stores of rum and other
drinking spirits are hereby closed...

438
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:09,224
to the colony of Rhode Island
for a period of three days.

439
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,457
- Yes, sir.
- Johnny, you can't do that.

440
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,931
Sit down, Mr. Hopkins.
You've abused the privilege.

441
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:20,494
The chair would like
to take this opportunity...

442
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:23,370
to welcome Dr. Lyman Hall of Georgia
to this Congress...

443
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:25,739
and hopes he will make
the best of it.

444
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,305
My God, it's hot.

445
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,817
The secretary will read the roll.

446
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:36,410
All members present
with the following exceptions:

447
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,457
Mr. Paine, Mr. Gerry,
Mr. Samuel Adams of Massachusetts...

448
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:43,927
Mr. Morton of Pennsylvania, Mr. Wythe
and Mr. Richard Henry Lee of Virginia...

449
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,862
and the entire delegation
of New Jersey.

450
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:50,867
I'm concerned over the continual absence
of one-thirteenth of this Congress.

451
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:52,300
Where is New Jersey?

452
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:56,568
Somewhere between
New York and Pennsylvania.

453
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:01,444
Thank you very much.

454
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:05,142
Dr. Franklin, have you heard anything?
Your son resides there.

455
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:06,649
Son, sir? What son?

456
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:10,252
The royal governor
of New Jersey, sir.

457
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,983
As that title
might suggest, sir...

458
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,390
we are not in touch
at the present time.

459
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,360
Yes.

460
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:20,125
Well...
Now for the weather report...

461
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,132
Mr. Jefferson of Virginia.

462
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:27,768
- Mr. Jefferson!
- Present, sir.

463
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,898
May we hear
about the weather?

464
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:32,568
As if it weren't
speaking for itself.

465
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:36,773
Eighty-seven degrees
of temperature...

466
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:40,511
30-point-aught-six inches
of mercury.

467
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,678
Wind...

468
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:45,348
from the southwest
for the rest of the day.

469
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:49,291
And tonight...
tonight I'm leaving for home.

470
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,851
- On business?
- Family business.

471
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,797
Give her a flourish for me,
young feller.

472
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,421
From the commander,
army of the United Colonies.

473
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:27,659
To New York,
dispatch number 1,137.

474
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:30,132
Ah, sweetJesus!

475
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:33,068
To the Honorable Congress,
John Hancock, president. "Dear sir...

476
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,766
it is with grave apprehension
that I have learned this day...

477
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,865
of the sailing
from Halifax, Nova Scotia...

478
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,933
of a considerable force
of British troops...

479
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:42,206
in the company of foreign mercenaries
and under the command...

480
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,214
of General Sir William Howe.

481
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,750
There can be no doubt
that their destination is New York...

482
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:49,912
for to take and hold this city
and the Hudson Valley beyond...

483
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:52,889
would serve to separate New England
from the rest of the colonies...

484
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,858
permitting both sections
to be crushed in turn.

485
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:58,760
Sadly, I see no way of stopping them
at the present time...

486
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,923
as my army is
absolutely falling apart.

487
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,229
My military chest
is totally exhausted.

488
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:06,464
My commissary general
has strained his credit to the last.

489
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:10,269
My quartermaster has no food,
no arms, no ammunition...

490
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:13,208
and my troops are in
a state of near mutiny.

491
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:18,045
I pray God some relief arrives
before the armada, but fear it will not.

492
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:20,050
Your obedient...

493
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:22,619
G. Washington."

494
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,854
- Mr. President!
- Colonel McKean.

495
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:31,055
Surely we have managed to promote
the gloomiest man on this continent...

496
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:33,063
to the head of our troops.

497
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:37,465
Those dispatches are
the most depressing accumulation...

498
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:43,167
of disaster, doom and despair in
the entire annals of military history.

499
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,436
Colonel McKean, please!

500
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:49,207
- What?
- It's too hot.

501
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,547
Well, I suppose so.

502
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:57,077
General Washington will continue wording
his dispatches as he sees fit.

503
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:59,146
And I'm sure we all pray...

504
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:03,320
he finds happier thoughts
to convey in the near future.

505
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:06,329
Mr. Thomson,
are there any resolutions?

506
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:08,888
Dr. Josiah Barlett
of New Hampshire.

507
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:13,533
"Resolved: That for the duration
of the present hostilities...

508
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:16,665
the Congress discourage every type
of extravagance and dissipation...

509
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:19,608
elaborate funerals
and other expensive diversions...

510
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:22,373
especially all horse racing,
gambling...

511
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:25,280
and other forms
of sinful activity...

512
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,817
Fire wagon!

513
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:46,937
- Where's the fire? Can anybody tell?
- Looks like the Pepperton house.

514
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:49,997
- Couldn't be. It's brand-new.
- It might be the city tavern.

515
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,008
Bite your tongue, man.

516
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:04,154
Benjy, I'm back!
I'm back, Johnny!

517
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:13,097
- Lee, is it done?
- First things first.

518
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:17,533
Tom, your little bride wants to know:
"When is he coming home?"

519
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,264
- I leave tonight.
- Never mind that, man. Is it done?

520
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:23,205
Done? Why, certain-Lee.

521
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:27,074
Mr. President, I have returned from
Virginia with the following resolution.

522
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:30,740
"Resolved: That these united colonies
are, and of a right ought to be...

523
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:32,339
free and independent states...

524
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:34,977
that they are absolved
from allegiance to the British crown...

525
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:38,318
and that all political connection
between them and Great Britain is...

526
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:42,553
and ought to be
totally dissolved."

527
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,152
Mr. President,
I second the proposal.

528
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:47,220
The resolution has been
proposed and seconded.

529
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,289
The chair will now
entertain debate.

530
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:52,393
- Mr. Dickinson.
- Mr. President.

531
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,064
Pennsylvania moves,
as always...

532
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:59,303
that the question of independence
be postponed indefinitely.

533
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:01,106
I second the motion.

534
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,511
Judge Wilson...

535
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:06,345
in your eagerness to be loved,
you seem to have forgotten...

536
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:09,284
that Pennsylvania
cannot second its own motion.

537
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:12,622
Delaware seconds.

538
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,749
You would, you lousy wart.

539
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:18,553
The motion to postpone
has been moved and seconded.

540
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,028
Mr. Thomson.

541
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,266
On the motion
to postpone indefinitely...

542
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,269
the resolution on independency
or proceed with the debate...

543
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:29,773
all those in favor of debate say "yea,"
all those for postponement say "nay."

544
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:33,902
- New Hampshire.
- New Hampshire favors debate. Yea.

545
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:38,547
New Hampshire says yea.
Massachusetts?

546
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:44,145
Massachusetts, having borne
the brunt of the king's tyranny...

547
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:45,814
Yes, I said tyranny.

548
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:49,553
Massachusetts now
and for all time says yea.

549
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:52,929
Massachusetts says yea.

550
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:54,487
Rhode Island?

551
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,924
Mr. Hopkins.

552
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:02,103
- Where's Rhode Island?
- Out visiting the necessary.

553
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:05,734
After what Rhode Island's consumed,
I can't say I'm surprised.

554
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,744
We'll come back to him,
Mr. Thomson.

555
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:09,780
Rhode Island passes.

556
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,452
Connecticut.

557
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:20,356
While Connecticut has,
till now...

558
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:23,121
been against this proposal...

559
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:25,560
our legislature has instructed me
that in the event...

560
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,827
it is introduced by any colony
outside of New England...

561
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,266
we could not any longer
withhold our support.

562
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:33,496
- Connecticut says yea.
- Hear! Hear!

563
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:36,335
Connecticut says yea.
New York.

564
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:39,809
New York abstains, courteously.

565
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:42,505
- New York abstains.
- Courteously.

566
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:48,476
- New Jersey.
- Absent, Mr. Secretary.

567
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:51,488
New Jersey's absent.
Pennsylvania.

568
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:55,823
Pennsylvania, for the 24th time,
says nay.

569
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:58,327
Pennsylvania says nay.
Delaware.

570
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:03,859
Delaware, as ever for independence,
says yea.

571
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,631
Delaware says yea.
Maryland.

572
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:10,572
Maryland would welcome independence
if it were given...

573
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:14,008
but is highly skeptical
that it can be taken.

574
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:16,239
Maryland says nay.

575
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:19,743
Maryland says nay.
Virginia.

576
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:22,547
Virginia, the first colony,
says yea.

577
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:28,181
Virginia says yea.
North Carolina.

578
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:32,787
North Carolina respectfully yields
to South Carolina.

579
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:35,856
- South Carolina.
- Mr. President...

580
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:39,460
although we of South Carolina
have never seriously considered...

581
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:41,630
the question of independence...

582
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:45,972
when a gentleman proposes it,
attention must be paid.

583
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:50,770
However, we in the Deep South...

584
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:52,941
unlike our friends
in New England...

585
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:57,545
have no cause for impatience
at the present time.

586
00:35:57,622 --> 00:36:01,251
If at some future date it becomes
the wish of all our sister colonies...

587
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:04,852
to effect a separation,
we will not stand in the way.

588
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:06,863
But for the time being...

589
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:10,958
South Carolina
will wait and watch.

590
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:13,401
The vote is nay.

591
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:18,533
- North Carolina...
- Says nay. Yes, Mr. Hewes. I know.

592
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,278
Georgia.

593
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,183
Georgia.

594
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:33,287
Mr. President, Georgia seems to be split
right down the middle on this issue.

595
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:36,622
The people are against it,
and I'm for it.

596
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:42,094
However, I'm afraid
I'm not quite certain...

597
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:46,159
whether representing the people means
relying on their judgment or on my own.

598
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:48,398
In all fairness,
until I can figure that out...

599
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:50,838
I'd better lean
a little on their side.

600
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:52,341
Georgia says nay.

601
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:59,238
Georgia says nay.

602
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:01,251
Rhode Island.

603
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:05,747
Second call, Rhode Island!

604
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:07,415
Rhode Island!

605
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:10,187
I'm coming! I'm coming!

606
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:12,593
Hold your damn horses.

607
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:16,497
- We're waiting on you, Mr. Hopkins.
- Well, it won't kill you.

608
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:20,094
You'd think the Congress
would have its own privy.

609
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:22,105
All right,
where does she stand?

610
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:25,700
Five for debate, five for postponement,
one abstention and one absence.

611
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:27,801
So it's up to me, huh?

612
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:29,812
Well, I'll tell ya.

613
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:34,340
In all my years I never seen,
heard nor smelled an issue...

614
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:37,285
that was so dangerous
it couldn't be talked about.

615
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:41,291
Hell, yes. I'm for debating anything.
Rhode Island says yea.

616
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:46,330
McNair, get Mr. Hopkins a rum.

617
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:49,833
Get him the whole damn barrel
if he wants.

618
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:53,269
The chair now declares this Congress
a Committee of the Whole...

619
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:56,738
for the purpose of debating
Virginia's resolution on independence.

620
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:58,741
Mr. Dickinson.

621
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:05,514
Well, now, you've got
your way at last, Mr. Adams.

622
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:08,609
The matter
may now be discussed.

623
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:11,712
I confess
I'm almost relieved.

624
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:15,350
There's a question I've been
fairly itching to ask you.

625
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:20,956
- Why?
- Why what, Mr. Dickinson?

626
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:24,297
Well, why independence,
Mr. Adams?

627
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:25,699
For the obvious reason...

628
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:30,173
that our continued association with
Great Britain has grown intolerable.

629
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:33,699
Well, to whom, Mr. Adams?
To you?

630
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:36,872
Well, then I suggest
you sever your ties immediately.

631
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:39,142
But please be kind enough...

632
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:42,743
to leave the rest of us
where we are.

633
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,845
For myself,
I have no objection at all...

634
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:47,550
to being part
of the greatest empire on earth...

635
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:50,685
to enjoying its protection
and sharing its benefits.

636
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:53,025
Benefits?

637
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,258
What benefits?

638
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,564
Crippling taxes?
Cruel repressions?

639
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:00,570
Abolished rights?

640
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:06,401
Is that all England means
to you, sir?

641
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:11,377
Is that all the pride and affection
you can muster...

642
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,849
for the nation
that bore you...

643
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:17,513
for the noblest, most civilized
nation on the face of this planet?

644
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:21,456
What, would you have us forsake
Hastings and Magna Carta...

645
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,961
Strongbow and Lionheart,
Drake and Marlborough...

646
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,963
Tudors, Stuarts
and Plantagenets?

647
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,862
For what, sir?

648
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,867
Tell me. For what?

649
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:36,105
For you?

650
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:42,973
Some men are patriots,
like General Washington...

651
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,345
and some are anarchists,
like Mr. Paine.

652
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:48,249
Some even are internationalists,
like Dr. Franklin.

653
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,844
But you, sir...

654
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:56,384
you are merely an agitator,
disturbing the peace...

655
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:00,692
creating disorder, endangering
the public welfare, and for what?

656
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:03,097
Your petty little
personal complaints:

657
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:06,466
"Your taxes are too high."

658
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:10,906
Well, sir, so are mine.

659
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,874
Come, come, Mr. Adams.

660
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:19,541
If you have grievances,
and I'm sure you have...

661
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:23,314
our present system must provide
a gentler means of redressing them...

662
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:25,912
short of revolution.

663
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,185
Yes, that's what he wants.

664
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,352
Nothing less will satisfy him.

665
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,591
Violence, rebellion, treason.

666
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,927
Now, Mr. Adams...

667
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:42,166
are these the acts
of Englishmen?

668
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:44,764
Not Englishmen, Dickinson.
Americans.

669
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:46,810
No, sir. Englishmen!

670
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:50,973
Please, Mr. Dickinson, must you start
banging? How is a man to sleep?

671
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:55,941
Forgive me, Dr. Franklin,
but must you start speaking?

672
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,954
How is a man to stay awake?

673
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:01,752
We'll promise
to be quiet, sir.

674
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:05,023
I'm sure everyone prefers
that you remain asleep.

675
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:07,529
If I'm to hear myself
called an Englishman, sir...

676
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:09,566
I assure you I'd prefer
I'd remained asleep.

677
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:13,364
Oh, now, what's so terrible
about being called an Englishman?

678
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:16,304
- The English don't seem to mind.
- Nor would I...

679
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:18,773
were I given the full rights
of an Englishman.

680
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:22,609
But to call me one without those rights
is like calling an ox a bull.

681
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,944
He's thankful for the honor,
but he'd much rather have restored...

682
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:26,448
what's rightfully his.

683
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,888
When did you first notice
they were missing, sir?

684
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:44,232
Fortunately,
the people of these colonies...

685
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:47,202
maintain a higher regard
for their mother country.

686
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:50,798
Higher, certainly,
than she feels for them.

687
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,809
Never was such
a valuable possession...

688
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:55,038
so stupidly
and so recklessly managed...

689
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:57,979
than this entire continent
by the British crown.

690
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:01,279
Our industry discouraged,
our resources pillaged.

691
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,986
Worst of all,
our very character stifled.

692
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,385
We've spawned
a new race here, Mr. Dickinson...

693
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:13,624
rougher, simpler, more violent,
more enterprising, less refined.

694
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:18,657
We're a new nationality.
We require a new nation.

695
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:23,739
Well...

696
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:27,573
that may be your opinion,
Dr. Franklin, but...

697
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:31,979
as I said, the people
feel quite differently.

698
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:35,416
Now, what do you know
about the people, Dickinson?

699
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:38,944
You don't speak for the people.
You represent only yourself.

700
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:41,253
And that precious status quo...

701
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:44,522
you keep imploring the people
to preserve for their own good...

702
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:49,225
is nothing more than the eternal
preservation of your own property.

703
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:53,064
Mr. Adams, you have
an annoying talent...

704
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:58,700
for making such delightful words
as "property" sound quite distasteful.

705
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:02,268
In heaven's name,
what's wrong with property?

706
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:05,611
Perhaps you've forgotten that many
of us first came to these shores...

707
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:08,151
in order to secure rights
to property...

708
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:12,552
and that we hold these rights no less
dear than the rights you speak of.

709
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:17,026
Yes. So safe, so fat,
so comfortable in Pennsylvania.

710
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,619
And what is this
independence of yours...

711
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:22,257
except the private grievance
of Massachusetts?

712
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:25,427
Why is it always Boston
that breaks the king's peace?

713
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:29,529
My dear Congress,
you must not adopt this evil measure.

714
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,768
It is the work of the devil.

715
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:36,745
Leave it where it belongs...
in New England.

716
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:40,341
Brother Dickinson, New England has
fought the devil more than 100 years.

717
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:42,681
And as of now,
Brother Sherman...

718
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:45,551
the devil
has been winning hands down.

719
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,487
Why, at this very moment, he's
sitting right here in this Congress.

720
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,519
Don't let him deceive you.
This proposal is entirely his doing.

721
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:55,531
Oh, it may bear
Virginia's name...

722
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,433
but it reeks
of Adams, Adams and more Adams.

723
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:01,767
Look at him.
Ready to lead this continent...

724
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,307
down the fiery path
of total destruction.

725
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:08,778
Oh, good God! Why can't you acknowledge
what already exists?

726
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:12,304
It has been more than a year
since Concord and Lexington.

727
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:14,817
Damn it, man,
we're at war right now!

728
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:18,218
You may be at war.
You... Boston and John Adams.

729
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:20,882
But you will never speak
for Pennsylvania.

730
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:23,153
- Nor for Delaware.
- Mr. Read...

731
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:26,594
you represent
only one-third of Delaware.

732
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,723
The sensible third,
Mr. Rodney.

733
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,962
Sit down,
or I'll knock you down.

734
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:36,437
Sit down, all three of you! McNair,
do something about that damn dog!

735
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,567
- Fetch me a rum.
- Get the dog first.

736
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:41,577
I only got two hands.

737
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:49,381
Christ, it's hot!

738
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:02,729
Oh. Please do go on,
gentlemen.

739
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,166
You're making the only breeze
in Philadelphia.

740
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:12,271
Mr. Adams, perhaps you could
clear up something for me.

741
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:14,606
After we have
achieved independence...

742
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:17,408
who do you propose
would govern in South Carolina?

743
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:20,750
The people, of course.

744
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:24,151
Which people, sir?
The people of South Carolina...

745
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,621
or the people of Massachusetts?

746
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:31,354
Admit it, Neddy. You're against
independence now and you always will be.

747
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:32,952
Aye.

748
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:38,365
Gentlemen,
you refuse to understand us.

749
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:41,927
We desire independence. Yes.

750
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:46,066
For South Carolina.
That is our country.

751
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:49,340
And as such,
we don't wish to belong to anyone.

752
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:52,314
Not to England
and not to you.

753
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:55,846
We intend to have
one nation, Rutledge.

754
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:59,116
A nation of sovereign states,
Mr. Adams.

755
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:02,386
United for our mutual
protection, but...

756
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:04,927
separate for our
individual pursuits.

757
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:08,089
Now, that is what
we have understood it to be...

758
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:11,464
and that is what
we will support.

759
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,395
As soon as everyone
supports it.

760
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:21,801
Well, there you are,
Mr. Adams.

761
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:24,404
You must see
that we need time.

762
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:29,919
Time to make certain who we are and
where we stand in regard to one another.

763
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:33,821
For if we do not determine the nature
of the beast before we set it free...

764
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:36,553
it will end
by consuming us all.

765
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,687
For once in your life,
Wilson...

766
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:41,697
take a chance.

767
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:46,001
I say the time is now.

768
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:48,060
It may never come again.

769
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,368
Your clock is fast, Mr. Adams.

770
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,431
I say we're not yet ripe
for independence.

771
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:56,104
Not ripe?
Hell, we're rotting for want of it.

772
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:00,378
Gentlemen, please, what in God's name
is the infernal hurry?

773
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,441
Why must this question
be settled now?

774
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:04,783
What's wrong with now,
Mr. Chase?

775
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:07,255
General Washington
is in the field.

776
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:11,351
If he's defeated as it now appears,
we'll be inviting the hangman.

777
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:15,660
But if, by some miracle,
he should actually win...

778
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:18,428
we can then declare anything
we damn please.

779
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,300
The sentiments
of North Carolina precisely.

780
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,265
Has it ever occurred
to either of you...

781
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,707
that an army needs
something to fight for...

782
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:28,711
in order to win?

783
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:32,306
A purpose? A goal?
A flag of its own?

784
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:34,782
Mr. Adams...

785
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:37,946
how can a nation
of only two million souls...

786
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,285
stand up to an empire
of ten million?

787
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:44,225
Think of it. Ten million.
How do we compensate for that shortage?

788
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:47,058
It's simple, Mr. Chase.
Increase and multiply.

789
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,724
How's that?

790
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,769
We will more than compensate
with spirit.

791
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:55,828
I tell you that there is
a spirit out there among the people...

792
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:57,965
that is sadly lacking
in this Congress.

793
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:01,204
Yes, of course.
Now it's spirit.

794
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:03,212
Why didn't I think of that?

795
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,614
No army, no navy,
no arms, no ammunition...

796
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:11,848
no treasury, no friends.

797
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:16,018
But bless our soul, spirit.

798
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:18,493
Mr. Lee, Mr. Hopkins...

799
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,053
Mr. Rodney, Colonel McKean...

800
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:23,622
Dr. Franklin.

801
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:28,763
Why have you joined
this incendiary little man...

802
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:32,104
this Boston radical...

803
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:34,609
this agitator...

804
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:37,169
this demagogue...

805
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,010
this madman?

806
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:42,108
Are you calling me
a madman, you...

807
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:44,449
you fribble!

808
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:49,150
You and your
Pennsylvania proprietors.

809
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:52,161
Oh, you cool, considerate men.

810
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:55,858
You hang to the rear on every issue
so that if we should go under...

811
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,867
you'll still remain afloat.

812
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:02,599
- Are you calling me a coward?
- Yes. Coward.

813
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:05,039
- Madman!
- Landlord!

814
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,803
Lawyer!

815
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:14,851
Stop it! Stop it!

816
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:19,885
This is the Congress.
Stop it, I say!

817
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,949
- The enemy's out there.
- No, Mr. Rodney, the enemy is here.

818
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:25,927
No. I say he's out there.

819
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:31,229
England. England closing in,
cutting off our air.

820
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,235
There's no time!

821
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,808
No air.

822
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:40,809
Dr. Hall.

823
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:48,848
- Colonel McKean.
- Aye. It's the cancer.

824
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:51,683
But he should go home.

825
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:55,054
A man should die
in his own bed.

826
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,155
- John. John Adams.
- I'm here, Caesar.

827
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:05,594
I leave you...

828
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,933
a divided Delaware.

829
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:12,972
- Forgive me.
- I'll take you home, Caesar.

830
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:40,092
I'll be back within the week.

831
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:52,043
Mr. President, South Carolina
calls the question.

832
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:57,409
- What's that, Mr. Rutledge?
- I said, Mr. President...

833
00:50:57,487 --> 00:51:01,389
South Carolina
desires to end the debate...

834
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,426
and calls the question
of independence.

835
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:07,429
- Delaware seconds.
- Thank you.

836
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:11,929
Gentlemen, please!

837
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:14,994
The question
has been called and seconded.

838
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,268
The secretary
will record the vote.

839
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:20,400
Franklin, do something. Think.

840
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:22,604
I'm thinking,
but nothing's coming.

841
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:24,806
All those in favor
of the resolution on independence...

842
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:27,577
as proposed by the colony of Virginia,
signify by saying...

843
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:29,676
Mr. Secretary...

844
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,744
would you please read
the resolution again?

845
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:32,948
What?

846
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:37,224
- I'd forgotten it.
- Now, please.

847
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:42,189
"Resolved:
These united colonies are...

848
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:44,961
and of a right ought to be
free and independent..."

849
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:54,875
Excuse me.
Is this the Continental Congress?

850
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:58,381
Well, yes, I can see
that it must be.

851
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:01,315
It's all right. We found it.

852
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:03,978
We've been looking for you
everywhere, you see.

853
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:06,648
Someone told us that you
might be at Carpenters' Hall...

854
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:09,453
and someone else
suggested Library Hall.

855
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:12,154
- So finally we asked a constable...
- Excuse me, sir, but...

856
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:15,460
if you don't mind, the Congress
is about to decide...

857
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:17,466
the question
of American independence.

858
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:21,269
How splendid.
That means we're not too late.

859
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:23,272
These gentlemen are
Mr. Francis Hopkinson...

860
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:27,276
Mr. Richard Stockton,
and I'm the Reverend John Witherspoon.

861
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,878
We're the new delegates
from New Jersey.

862
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:35,679
New Jersey?

863
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:44,117
Dr. Franklin, I regret that I must be
the bearer of unhappy tidings, sir...

864
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:46,788
but your son,
the royal governor of New Jersey...

865
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:48,797
has been taken prisoner...

866
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:53,131
and has been moved under guard to the
colony of Connecticut for safekeeping.

867
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:56,468
- Is he unharmed, sir?
- When last I heard, he was. Yes, sir.

868
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:00,203
Then why the long face? I hear
Connecticut is an excellent location.

869
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:03,644
Tell me. Why did they arrest
the little bastard?

870
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:07,307
Our...

871
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:11,115
New Jersey legislature has recalled
the old delegation to this Congress...

872
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:14,316
and has sent a new one.

873
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:16,859
Quickly, man, where do you
stand on independence?

874
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:20,090
Well, haven't I made that clear?
Well, I suppose I haven't.

875
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:22,097
But that's the reason
for the change.

876
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:25,464
We've been instructed
to vote for independence.

877
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:30,438
Massachusetts is now ready
for the vote on independence...

878
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:34,841
and reminds the chair of its privilege
to decide all votes that are deadlocked.

879
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:37,311
I won't forget, Mr. Adams.

880
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:42,417
The chair takes this opportunity
to welcome the New Jersey delegation...

881
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:45,977
and appoints the Reverend Witherspoon
congressional chaplain...

882
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:50,220
- if he will accept the post.
- With much pleasure, sir.

883
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:56,956
Very well. Mr. Thomson, you may now
proceed with the vote on independence.

884
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:59,797
All in favor of the resolution
on independence...

885
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:03,168
- as proposed by the colony of Virginia...
- Mr. President.

886
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:09,274
Pennsylvania moves that any vote
in favor of independence...

887
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,314
must be unanimous.

888
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:15,777
- What?
- I second the motion.

889
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:19,310
- Judge Wilson!
- Oh, my God.

890
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:21,619
Delaware seconds, Mr. President.

891
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:24,182
No vote has ever had to be unanimous,
Dickinson, and you know it.

892
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,627
- Yes, but this one must be.
- On what grounds?

893
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:30,564
That no colony be torn from its
mother country without its own consent.

894
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:31,999
Hear! Hear!

895
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:35,834
But it will never be unanimous,
damn it.

896
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:38,669
If you say so, Mr. Adams.

897
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:43,576
It has been moved and seconded
that the vote on independence...

898
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:45,877
must be unanimous
in order to carry.

899
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,509
All those in favor,
signify by saying yea.

900
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:49,517
Yea!

901
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:54,046
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

902
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:57,719
- Six colonies say yea. Against?
- Nay!

903
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:02,026
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

904
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:04,999
Six colonies say nay.

905
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:10,005
Mr. Secretary, New York
abstains, courteously.

906
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:14,407
Mr. Morris, why does New York
constantly abstain?

907
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:17,139
Why does New York
simply stay in New York?

908
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:21,009
Very well.
The vote is tied.

909
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:25,688
The principles of independence
have no greater advocate in Congress...

910
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:27,916
than its president...

911
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:31,324
and that is why I must join those
who vote for unanimity.

912
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:34,522
Good God, John!
What are you doing? You've sunk us.

913
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:38,761
Now, hear me out. Don't you see that
any colony who opposes independence...

914
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,769
will be forced to fight
on the side of England?

915
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:43,567
That we'll be setting
brother against brother...

916
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:48,043
that our new nation will carry
as its emblem the mark of Cain.

917
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:50,045
I can see no other way.

918
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:54,743
Either we all walk together
or together we must stay where we are.

919
00:55:56,386 --> 00:56:00,379
- The man's from Massachusetts.
- Very well. Proceed, Mr. Thomson.

920
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:02,823
A unanimous vote
being necessary to carry...

921
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:05,360
if any be opposed
to the resolution on independence...

922
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:08,693
- as proposed by the colony of Virginia...
- Mr. President.

923
00:56:08,765 --> 00:56:11,529
Oh, for heaven's sake,
let me get through it once.

924
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:13,535
Mr. President.

925
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:17,164
- I move for a postponement.
- Postponement?

926
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,174
I wish you the same luck
I had with it.

927
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:21,176
Mr. Adams is right.
We need a postponement.

928
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:24,611
- On what grounds?
- On what grounds?

929
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:29,141
Mr. President, how can this Congress
vote on independence...

930
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:34,316
without a written declaration
of some sort defining it?

931
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:37,585
What sort of declaration?

932
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:42,959
Well, you know. Listing
the reasons for the separation...

933
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:46,433
our purposes, goals,
so forth, so on.

934
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:48,903
- Ditto, Ditto.
- Ditto, ditto, et cetera, et cetera.

935
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:50,439
We know those, don't we?

936
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:55,203
Oh, yes, good God,
we know them.

937
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:58,247
But what about
the rest of the world?

938
00:56:58,314 --> 00:57:00,680
Certainly we require
the assistance...

939
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:04,242
of a powerful nation
such as France or Spain...

940
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:09,087
and such a written declaration would
be consistent with European delicacy.

941
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,687
Come now, Mr. Adams.
You'll have to do better than that.

942
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:17,096
Answer straight.
What would be its purpose?

943
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:19,965
Yes. Well...

944
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:27,532
To place before mankind
the common sense of the subject...

945
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,841
in terms so plain and firm...

946
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:33,712
as to command their assent.

947
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:44,022
Mr. Jefferson,
are you seriously suggesting...

948
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:46,994
that we publish a paper
declaring to all the world...

949
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:51,329
that an illegal rebellion is,
in reality, a legal one?

950
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:54,234
Oh, Mr. Dickinson,
I'm surprised at you.

951
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:57,068
You should know the rebellion
is always legal in the first person...

952
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,664
such as our rebellion.

953
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:02,006
It's only in the third person...
"their" rebellion... that it is illegal.

954
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:08,183
Mr. President, I second the motion
to postpone the vote on independence...

955
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:12,085
for a period of time sufficient
for the writing of a declaration.

956
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,521
It has been moved and seconded.
Mr. Thomson.

957
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:18,220
All those in favor of the motion
to postpone, signify by saying yea.

958
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:19,693
Yea!

959
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:23,994
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

960
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:27,036
- Six colonies say yea. Against?
- Nay!

961
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:31,699
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

962
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:33,742
Six colonies say nay.

963
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:40,038
Mr. Secretary,
New York abstains, courteously.

964
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:48,855
Mr. Morris, what in hell
goes on in New York?

965
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:52,622
I'm sorry, Mr. President,
but the simple fact is that...

966
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:58,099
our legislature has never sent us
explicit instructions on anything.

967
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:00,635
Never?

968
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,637
That's impossible.

969
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:06,204
Mr. President,
have you ever been present...

970
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:09,302
at a meeting
of the New York legislature?

971
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,847
They speak very fast
and very loud...

972
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:14,383
and nobody listens
to anybody else...

973
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:17,817
with the result
that nothing ever gets done.

974
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,948
I beg the Congress's pardon.

975
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,954
My sympathies, Mr. Morris.

976
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:30,796
The vote again being tied, the chair
decides in favor of postponement.

977
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:32,630
So ruled.

978
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:34,897
A committee will now be formed
to manage the declaration.

979
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:37,838
Said document to be written, debated,
approved by the beginning ofJuly...

980
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:40,808
some three weeks hence,
at which time...

981
00:59:40,877 --> 00:59:44,813
Virginia's resolution on independence
will finally be voted.

982
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:47,441
Is that clear? Very well.

983
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:51,112
Will the following gentlemen serve on
the Declaration Committee: Dr. Franklin?

984
00:59:51,187 --> 00:59:52,279
Gladly.

985
00:59:52,355 --> 00:59:54,346
- Mr. John Adams?
- Yes.

986
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:55,516
Mr. Sherman?

987
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,356
- Mr. Livingston?
- Right.

988
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,328
And, of course, Mr. Lee.

989
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:04,765
Oh, excuse me, but I must be returning
to the sovereign colony of Virginia...

990
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:07,428
as I have been asked
to serve as governor.

991
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:11,405
And therefore I must decline,
respectful-Lee.

992
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,842
Very well, Mr. Lee.
You're excused.

993
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:20,474
I supposed we could leave it
a four-man committee.

994
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:22,916
Just a moment.
This business needs a Virginian.

995
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:25,511
Therefore, I propose a replacement...
Mr. Thomas Jefferson.

996
01:00:25,588 --> 01:00:28,648
- No. Mr. Adams...
- Very well. Mr. Jefferson will serve.

997
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:31,250
- I'm going home, too, to my wife.
- Move to adjourn.

998
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:32,794
- Wait.
- I second.

999
01:00:32,862 --> 01:00:36,263
Mr. Hancock,
I haven't seen her for six months.

1000
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:38,266
Moved and seconded.
Any objections?

1001
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:40,495
I have objections.
I have lots of objections.

1002
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:42,697
So ruled!
Congress stands adjourned!

1003
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:45,138
John, I need to see my wife.

1004
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:48,871
- It's all right. Come along.
- No. I'm going home tonight.

1005
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:54,645
Of course you are. Of course.
McNair, some rum up to my office.

1006
01:00:54,717 --> 01:00:58,653
Don't worry, Tom.
Let me handle it.

1007
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:00,655
I'll get Adams to write it.

1008
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:03,191
I don't know.
He had a funny look on his face.

1009
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:04,658
He always does.

1010
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:07,491
All right, gentlemen,
let's get on with it.

1011
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:10,589
Which of us will write
our Declaration of Independence?

1012
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:16,229
<i>Mr. Adams</i>
<i>I say you should write it</i>

1013
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:18,603
<i>To your legal mind</i>
<i>and brilliance we defer</i>

1014
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:22,167
<i>Is that so</i>
<i>Well, if I'm the one to do it</i>

1015
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:24,110
<i>They'll run their quill pens</i>
<i>through it</i>

1016
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,910
<i>I'm obnoxious and disliked</i>
<i>You know that, sir</i>

1017
01:01:26,983 --> 01:01:29,952
- Yes, I know.
- <i>I say you should write it, Franklin</i>

1018
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,748
- <i>Yes, you</i>
- <i>Hell, no</i>

1019
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:34,381
<i>Yes, you, Dr. Franklin, you</i>

1020
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:36,220
- <i>But, but</i>
- <i>You, you</i>

1021
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:38,453
- <i>You</i>
- <i>But</i>

1022
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:44,125
<i>Mr. Adams</i>
<i>But, Mr. Adams</i>

1023
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,636
<i>The things I write</i>
<i>are only light extemporanea</i>

1024
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:51,265
<i>I won't put politics on paper</i>
<i>It's a mania</i>

1025
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:55,208
<i>So I refuse to use the pen</i>
<i>in Pennsylvania</i>

1026
01:01:55,278 --> 01:01:59,044
<i>Pennsylvania</i>
<i>Pennsylvania</i>

1027
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:02,915
<i>Refuse to use the pen</i>

1028
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:17,154
<i>Mr. Sherman</i>
<i>I say you should write it</i>

1029
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:19,963
<i>You were never controversial</i>
<i>as it were</i>

1030
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:23,164
- That is true.
- <i>Whereas, if I'm the one to do it</i>

1031
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,173
<i>They'll run</i>
<i>their quill pens through it</i>

1032
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:26,799
<i>I'm obnoxious and disliked</i>

1033
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:28,571
- <i>You know that, sir</i>
- Yes, I do.

1034
01:02:28,644 --> 01:02:31,442
<i>So I say you should write it</i>
<i>Roger, yes, you</i>

1035
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:35,348
- Good heavens, no.
- <i>Yes, you, Roger Sherman, you</i>

1036
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,283
- <i>But, but</i>
- <i>You, you</i>

1037
01:02:37,353 --> 01:02:39,378
<i>But</i>

1038
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:44,417
<i>Mr. Adams</i>
<i>But, Mr. Adams</i>

1039
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:48,157
<i>I cannot write with any style</i>
<i>or proper etiquette</i>

1040
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:51,792
<i>I don't know a participle</i>
<i>from a predicate</i>

1041
01:02:51,868 --> 01:02:54,701
<i>I am just a simple cobbler</i>
<i>from Connecticut</i>

1042
01:02:55,805 --> 01:02:59,400
<i>Connecticut</i>
<i>Connecticut</i>

1043
01:02:59,475 --> 01:03:03,138
<i>A simple cobbler, he</i>

1044
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:17,223
<i>Mr. Livingston</i>
<i>maybe you should write it</i>

1045
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:20,057
<i>You have many friends</i>
<i>and you're a diplomat</i>

1046
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:22,996
- Oh, that word.
- <i>Whereas, if I'm the one to do it</i>

1047
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:24,794
<i>They'll run their quill pens</i>
<i>through it</i>

1048
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:27,301
<i>He's obnoxious and disliked</i>
<i>Did you know that</i>

1049
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:30,237
- I hadn't heard.
- <i>So I say you should write it, Robert</i>

1050
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:31,864
- <i>Yes, you</i>
- <i>Not me, Johnny</i>

1051
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:34,705
<i>Yes, you, Robert Livingston, you</i>

1052
01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:35,709
- <i>But</i>
- <i>You</i>

1053
01:03:35,778 --> 01:03:37,040
- <i>But, but</i>
- <i>You, you</i>

1054
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:41,106
<i>But</i>

1055
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:44,483
<i>Mr. Adams</i>
<i>Dear Mr. Adams</i>

1056
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:48,115
<i>I've been presented with a new son</i>
<i>by the noble stork</i>

1057
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:51,820
<i>So I am going home to celebrate</i>
<i>and pop the cork</i>

1058
01:03:51,894 --> 01:03:55,591
<i>With all the Livingstons together</i>
<i>back in old New York</i>

1059
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,155
<i>New York</i>

1060
01:03:57,233 --> 01:03:59,531
<i>New York</i>

1061
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:05,666
<i>Livingston's</i>
<i>going to pop a cork</i>

1062
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:18,279
<i>Mr. Adams</i>

1063
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:21,983
<i>Leave me alone</i>

1064
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:25,722
- Mr. Jefferson.
- Mr. Adams, I beg of you.

1065
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:29,128
I've not seen my wife
these past six months.

1066
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:33,032
"And we solemnly declare
that we will preserve our liberties...

1067
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:36,094
being with one mind
resolved to die free men...

1068
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:37,764
rather than to live slaves."

1069
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:42,573
Thomas Jefferson, on the "Necessity
ofTaking up Arms," 1775.

1070
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:44,078
Magnificent.

1071
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:49,743
You write ten times better
than any man in Congress, including me.

1072
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:55,724
For a man of only 33 years, you possess
a happy talent for composition...

1073
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:59,283
and a remarkable felicity
of expression.

1074
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:02,490
Now, then, sir.
Will you be a patriot...

1075
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,499
or a lover?

1076
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:07,769
A lover.

1077
01:05:09,305 --> 01:05:14,470
- <i>But I burn, Mr. A.</i>
- <i>So do I, Mr.J.</i>

1078
01:05:14,543 --> 01:05:16,033
- You?
- You do?

1079
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:17,602
Who'd have thought it?

1080
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:21,508
<i>Mr. Jefferson</i>

1081
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,747
<i>Dear Mr. Jefferson</i>

1082
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:30,452
<i>I'm only 41</i>
<i>I still have my virility</i>

1083
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:35,463
<i>And I can romp through Cupid's grove</i>
<i>with great agility</i>

1084
01:05:36,732 --> 01:05:42,034
<i>But life is more</i>
<i>than sexual combustability</i>

1085
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:44,129
- Jefferson, stop right there.
- <i>Bustability</i>

1086
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:46,367
<i>Bustability</i>

1087
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:49,934
- <i>Combustabili</i>...
- Quiet!

1088
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:56,346
Now, you'll write it, Mr.J.

1089
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:59,183
Who will make me, Mr. A.?

1090
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:01,189
I.

1091
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:02,815
You?

1092
01:06:02,892 --> 01:06:04,325
Yes.

1093
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:10,826
How?

1094
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:14,893
By physical force, if necessary.

1095
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:17,963
It's your duty, damn it.
Your duty.

1096
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:22,139
<i>Mr. Adams</i>

1097
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:25,669
<i>Damn you, Mr. Adams</i>

1098
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:28,410
<i>You're obnoxious and disliked</i>

1099
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:31,351
<i>That cannot be denied</i>

1100
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:37,359
<i>Once again you stand</i>
<i>between me and my lovely bride</i>

1101
01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:41,385
<i>Lovely bride</i>

1102
01:06:42,465 --> 01:06:48,062
<i>Oh, Mr. Adams</i>
<i>you are driving me to homicide</i>

1103
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:50,162
- Jefferson, stop right there!
- <i>Homicide</i>

1104
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,331
<i>Homicide</i>

1105
01:06:51,407 --> 01:06:53,341
Quiet!

1106
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:02,440
The decision is yours, Mr. Jefferson.
Do as you like with it.

1107
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:14,194
<i>We may see murder yet</i>

1108
01:07:21,804 --> 01:07:23,738
Damn the man.

1109
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:28,343
Goddamn the man.

1110
01:08:16,025 --> 01:08:17,959
Sorry.

1111
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:21,662
Pardon me, sir.

1112
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:25,624
How are you?

1113
01:08:40,249 --> 01:08:41,477
What is that racket?

1114
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:43,643
Latest thing from Europe, John.
It's called music.

1115
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:47,086
I came here hoping to hear
a pen scratching, not a bow.

1116
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:53,022
Jefferson,
I know you're in there!

1117
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:57,290
Are you finished?

1118
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:00,468
Well, is it written yet?

1119
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:05,899
Well, you've had
a whole week, man.

1120
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:09,001
Is it done?

1121
01:09:09,078 --> 01:09:11,046
Can I see it?

1122
01:09:18,053 --> 01:09:20,544
"There comes a time in the lives of men
when it becomes necessary...

1123
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:23,956
to advance from that subordination
in which they have hitherto rem..."

1124
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:27,257
This is terrible.
Where's the rest of it?

1125
01:09:33,602 --> 01:09:37,698
Do you mean to say
that it is not yet finished?

1126
01:09:37,773 --> 01:09:42,233
No, sir. I mean to say
that it's not yet begun.

1127
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:45,246
Good God!

1128
01:09:45,314 --> 01:09:47,748
A whole week!

1129
01:09:47,816 --> 01:09:50,842
The entire earth
was created in a week.

1130
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:58,287
Someday you must
tell me how you did it.

1131
01:10:00,996 --> 01:10:03,863
Disgusting.

1132
01:10:03,933 --> 01:10:07,926
Look at him, Franklin.
Virginia's most famous lover...

1133
01:10:08,504 --> 01:10:10,529
Virginia abstains.

1134
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:16,235
Well, cheer up, Jefferson.

1135
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:18,246
Get out of the dumps.
It'll come out all right, I assure you.

1136
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:21,374
Now, get back to work.

1137
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:24,044
Franklin, tell him
to get back to work.

1138
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:26,679
I think he's asleep.

1139
01:10:28,857 --> 01:10:31,018
Wake up, Franklin!

1140
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:38,162
View, hello!
And who, little girl, are you?

1141
01:10:42,004 --> 01:10:45,269
- John, who is she?
- His wife.

1142
01:10:46,308 --> 01:10:48,776
I hope.

1143
01:10:48,844 --> 01:10:50,778
What makes you think so?

1144
01:10:50,846 --> 01:10:54,907
- Because I sent for her.
- You what?

1145
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:57,544
It simply occurred to me that
the sooner his problem was solved...

1146
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:59,645
the sooner our problem
is solved.

1147
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:02,486
That's good thinking, John.
Good thinking.

1148
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:05,857
Madam, may I present myself?
John Adams.

1149
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:16,164
Oh, and Dr. Franklin.

1150
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,667
The inventor of the stove.

1151
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:28,512
Jefferson, kindly present me
to your wife.

1152
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:33,046
She is your wife, isn't she?

1153
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,852
Of course she is.
Look at the way they fit.

1154
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,794
Come along, John,
come along.

1155
01:11:39,862 --> 01:11:42,126
- Franklin, where are you going?
- Come along, John.

1156
01:11:42,197 --> 01:11:44,461
Come along where?
There's work to be done.

1157
01:11:44,533 --> 01:11:46,660
Obviously.

1158
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:50,967
Good God.
You don't mean to say that...

1159
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,100
I mean, they're not going to...

1160
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:56,736
In the middle
of the afternoon?

1161
01:11:56,812 --> 01:12:00,179
Not everybody's from Boston, John.

1162
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:02,183
Incredible.

1163
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:06,449
- Well, good-bye, John.
- Uh, Franklin?

1164
01:12:06,522 --> 01:12:09,184
- Uh, have you eaten?
- Not yet, but...

1165
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:11,351
I understand the turkey's fresh
at Bunch O' Grapes.

1166
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:14,487
Well, the fact is,
I have a rendezvous, John.

1167
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:17,896
I'd ask you along,
but talking makes her nervous.

1168
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:22,370
Yes, of course.

1169
01:12:41,824 --> 01:12:44,486
Incredible.

1170
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,830
Abigail?

1171
01:12:53,902 --> 01:12:56,370
I'm very lonely, Abigail.

1172
01:12:56,438 --> 01:12:59,464
<i>Are you, John? Then as long as</i>
<i>you were sending for wives...</i>

1173
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:01,475
<i>why didn't you</i>
<i>send for your own?</i>

1174
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:04,444
Oh, now, don't be
unreasonable, Abigail.

1175
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:06,743
<i>Oh, now I'm unreasonable.</i>

1176
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:11,514
- <i>You must add that to your list.</i>
- List?

1177
01:13:11,587 --> 01:13:16,320
The catalog of my faults
you included in your last letter.

1178
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:19,953
Oh, they were
fondly intended, madam.

1179
01:13:20,028 --> 01:13:23,259
- That I play at cards badly?
- A compliment.

1180
01:13:23,332 --> 01:13:27,701
- That my posture is crooked?
- An endearment.

1181
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:31,900
- That I read, write and think too much?
- An irony.

1182
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:34,033
That I'm pigeon-toed?

1183
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:38,572
Oh, well, now there
you have me, Abby.

1184
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:42,278
I'm afraid
you are pigeon-toed.

1185
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:48,687
Please. Come to Philadelphia.
Please come.

1186
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:51,157
Oh, thank you, John.

1187
01:13:51,226 --> 01:13:53,251
I do want to, but you know now
it's not possible.

1188
01:13:53,328 --> 01:13:55,558
The children have the measles.

1189
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:57,622
So you wrote.

1190
01:13:58,834 --> 01:14:00,768
Tom and little Abby.

1191
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:03,134
Only now it's Quincy and Charles.

1192
01:14:05,474 --> 01:14:08,739
And it appears the farm here
in Braintree is failing, John.

1193
01:14:10,145 --> 01:14:13,239
The chickens and the geese
have all died.

1194
01:14:13,315 --> 01:14:16,614
And the apples never
survived the late frost.

1195
01:14:17,986 --> 01:14:22,047
How do you suppose
she managed to get away?

1196
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:25,355
Well, the winters
are softer in Virginia.

1197
01:14:25,427 --> 01:14:28,294
And their women, John?

1198
01:14:28,363 --> 01:14:33,596
Fit for Virginians, madam, but pale,
puny things beside New England girls.

1199
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:38,797
I thank you for that.

1200
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:45,546
Abigail, how goes it with you?

1201
01:14:45,614 --> 01:14:48,674
Not well, John.
Not at all well.

1202
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:52,910
<i>I live like a nun</i>
<i>in a cloister</i>

1203
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:56,924
<i>Solitary, celibate</i>
<i>I hate it</i>

1204
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:58,926
And you, John?

1205
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:03,294
<i>I live like a monk</i>
<i>in an abbey</i>

1206
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:05,765
<i>Ditto, ditto</i>
<i>I hate it</i>

1207
01:15:07,102 --> 01:15:14,907
<i>Write to me with</i>
<i>sentimental effusion</i>

1208
01:15:14,977 --> 01:15:23,407
<i>Let me revel</i>
<i>in romantic illusion</i>

1209
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:30,516
<i>Do you still smell</i>
<i>of vanilla and spring air</i>

1210
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:35,986
<i>And is my favorite lover's pillow</i>

1211
01:15:36,064 --> 01:15:40,558
<i>Still firm and fair</i>

1212
01:15:40,636 --> 01:15:46,097
<i>What was there, John</i>

1213
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:53,740
<i>Still is there, John</i>

1214
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:58,013
<i>Come soon as you can</i>
<i>to my cloister</i>

1215
01:15:58,086 --> 01:16:02,546
<i>I've forgotten</i>
<i>the feel of your hand</i>

1216
01:16:02,624 --> 01:16:07,687
<i>Soon, madam, we shall walk</i>
<i>in Cupid's grove together</i>

1217
01:16:07,763 --> 01:16:14,134
<i>And we'll fondly survey</i>

1218
01:16:14,202 --> 01:16:21,438
<i>That promised land</i>

1219
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:26,038
<i>Till then, till then</i>

1220
01:16:26,114 --> 01:16:31,677
<i>I am as I ever was</i>

1221
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:36,452
<i>And ever shall be</i>

1222
01:16:36,525 --> 01:16:38,755
<i>Yours</i>

1223
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:41,352
<i>Yours</i>

1224
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,830
<i>Yours</i>

1225
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:46,925
<i>Yours</i>

1226
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:49,766
<i>Yours</i>

1227
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:53,339
<i>Saltpeter</i>

1228
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:58,001
<i>John</i>

1229
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,786
- What?
- What are you doing down here?

1230
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:13,885
I thought you'd be up there,
cracking the whip.

1231
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:18,729
- Well, the shutters are still closed.
- My word!

1232
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,166
So they are.

1233
01:17:22,771 --> 01:17:26,002
- Well, as the French say...
- Oh, please, Franklin!

1234
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:30,568
Spare me your bawdy mind,
first thing in the morning.

1235
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:31,908
Dare we call?

1236
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:34,073
A congressman dares anything.

1237
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:36,242
- Go ahead.
- Me?

1238
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:40,482
Your voice is more piercing.

1239
01:17:40,555 --> 01:17:44,582
- Oh, John, look at her.
- Oh, I am.

1240
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:47,094
She's even more magnificent
than I remember.

1241
01:17:49,064 --> 01:17:51,624
Of course, we didn't see
much of her front last night.

1242
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:53,691
- Good morrow, madam.
- Good morrow.

1243
01:17:57,272 --> 01:18:01,231
Is it the habit in Philadelphia
to shout at ladies from the street?

1244
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:03,539
- Not really, but...
- And for men of your age...

1245
01:18:03,612 --> 01:18:07,104
it is not only unseemly,
it is unsightly.

1246
01:18:08,316 --> 01:18:11,547
Excuse me, madam,
but we met last evening.

1247
01:18:12,554 --> 01:18:15,614
- I spoke to no one last evening.
- Indeed, you did not.

1248
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:18,285
Nonetheless, we did present ourselves.

1249
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,420
This is Mr. John Adams.
I'm Dr. Benjamin Franklin.

1250
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:25,826
The inventor of the stove.
