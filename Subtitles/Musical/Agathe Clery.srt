Right. We'll leave it at that.

Let's hope she fucks up

May she bungle it
May sha tangle it

No!

29
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:01,364
Spare change, lady?

30
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:04,001
Those half-wits will make us

Brussels Midi Station.
Train terminus.

37
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:29,951
I've always broken new ground,

38
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:31,994
anticipated women's desires.

39
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,595
One year ago, I decided

40
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:35,825
with my sons

41
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,094
to create a new line in skin care

42
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,631
for pale, sensitive complexions.

43
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,574
We called it Scandinav.

44
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,676
Today Scandinav is ready,

45
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,937
wa'ra launching it in France

46
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:51,480

47
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,413
Now over to Agatha Cléry

48
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:56,747
who's been caring
for this project from day one...

49
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,917
Care is clearly 0ur speciality!

50
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,995
She'll present Scandinav
to you in detail.

51
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,957
Agatha, over to you.

52
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:59,043
No, no, Agatha,

53
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,073
you've been perfect.

54
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,807
Thank you, sir.

55
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,442
You've won your colours
as marketing director.

56
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,787
You were with Scandinav
every step of the way.

57
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,687
If the latest tests are positive,

58
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,828

59
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,292
it's your baby now.

60
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,028
How can I thank you?

61
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,530
You owe this position
to your competence alone.

62
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,934
Independently of my affection
for you.

Tomorrow in Dublin

65

Between two planes
Between two trains

Between two planes
Between two trains

69
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,073
I get horny on trains

70
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,876
Our accounts
Are super-sized

71
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,844
We all live
Amazing lives

72
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,644
We're the ace

73
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:15,843
King and queen

74
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,421
Of the European scene

75
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:19,647
We're the ace

King and queen

77

Of the European scene

78
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,726
The business world
Is better than war

79
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,696
It's a daily rat race
For shelf space

80
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,028
I've always fought

81
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:34,601
To make women prettier

82
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,372
Always contrived

83
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:41,910
To make mealtimes dishier

84
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,715
We're the ace, king and queen

00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,910

00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,351
We're the ace, king and queen

00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:52,080
And the knave!

88
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,016

93
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:05,061
A consumer lurks behind each face

94
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,629
But to win his spending power

95
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:11,400
You can't watch the hour

96
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,576
Or slacken the pace

97
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,642
We're the ace, king and queen

98
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,324

No.

101
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,706

00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,823
Don't you lock your doors?

105
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:02,990
No, why?

106
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,686
At the first red light
they'll grab your bag.

107
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,991
- You think so?
- Sure. Especially this area.

108
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,797
Satellite dish outside,
Arabs inside.

109
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,395
Locl< these doors, please.

110
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,631
With all the Scandinav material too.

111
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,341
Leave it, guys.

112
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,346
Here's 0ur star!

113
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:23,773
I'm coming!

114
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:29,314
How are you?

115
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:30,918
I'm good.

116
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,079
- Have you eaten?
- I'm not hungry.

117
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,753
I'll fix you something.

118
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,331
- How did it go?
- It went well.

119
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,330
- Very well.
- Fill us in.

120
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,104
Oh, bugger!

121
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:50,400
The Belgians are over the moon.

122
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:51,337
And...

123
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,574
Guess what Louis Guinard said...

124
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:54,541
What?

125
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,046
Guess!

126
00:08:58,872 --> 00:08:59,646
No?

127
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:00,546
Yes...

128
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,550
- Not marketing director?
- Yes!

129
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,787
That's fantastic!

130
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,321
You move fast!

131
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:07,423
I'm not surprised.

132
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,615
Sha's a natural.

133
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,455
You'll always amaze ma!

134
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:12,358
She worked night and day.

135
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,896
No more than anyone else.

136
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,532
She knocked spots off us at Uni.

137
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,970
I've been slogging my guts out

138
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,604
fOl' OV€l' two Y€8l'S HOW!

139
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,795
It will happen.

140
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,599
Right. Harvé had to wait 3 years!

141
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,744
In my case the context wasn.

142
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,844
Different.

143
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,881
Here's to your success, babe!

144
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,038

Do I?

149
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,058
Like you've been on holiday.

150
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:42,621
Must be hard work.

151
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:43,852
Batter than a spa!

152
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,362
Ah, Lucie!

153
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:51,760
- Can you give this to Agatha?
- Sure.

154
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:57,636
Come in.

155
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:01,408
Excuse me, this is from Jean-Michel.

156
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:02,012
Hat is it?

157
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,042
CVs for the new product manager.

158
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:07,452
He wants you to meet them
and check them out.

159
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,819
Thank you, Lucie.

160
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:17,819
Thank you!

161
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:24,993
Your c0ffee.

162
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,513
So how's it going with Agatha?

163
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:37,909
I'm learning a lot.

164
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,608
You gotta hand it to har.
She's a pro.

165
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,480
She's a hard worker.

166
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,780
Incredibly hard.

167
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,089
She's being promoted again?

168
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:50,019
Mr Guinard
has made her marketing director.

169
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,052
Agathds very good.

170
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:53,959
Nota load of laughs...

171
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,726
That's not fair.
She can be very funny.

172
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,331
But not always on purpose.

173
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,664
Like when she's nice:

174
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,500
it's not on purpose either.

175
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,998
- But what a pro!
- No?

176
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:06,809
Yes, absolutely.

177
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,480
She's superbly professional.

178
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,380
- But...
- But?

179
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,042
No, nothing...

180
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,948
I don't know her well.

181
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:16,951
But...

182
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:19,647
Isn't shan.

183
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:21,883
Isn't she a bit...

184
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:23,323
A bit what?

185
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,452
A bit racist?

186
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:26,790
Racist? Agatha?

187
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,398
No!

188
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:29,727
What makes you say that?

189
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,693
A few remarks she made.

190
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,800
She doesn't much like Moroccans

191
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:37,002
Not much, no

192
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,938
Or care for the Algerians

193
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,882
Not too keen on Tunisians

194
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,916
Not them either

195
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,315
She's not a fan

196
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,955
Of North Africans

197
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:53,886
Not her thing!

198
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,826
Or Rumanians, I'll say!

199
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,556
Apart from that sha isn't racist

200
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,330
No!

201
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:02,630
No way!

202
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,662
Apart from that sha isn't racist

203
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,561
No, no way

204
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:13,467
She can't stomach the Congolese

205
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,643
Doesn't get on with the Senegalese

206
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,541
Definitely anti the Pakistanis

207
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:23,119
Can't get through to the Lebanese

208
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:25,753
And the Cameroonians, Oh please!

209
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:31,491
Won't even talk to the Javanese

210
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:34,856
Apart from that sha isn't racist

211
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:36,697
No!

212
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,000
No way!

213
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,497
Apart from that sha isn't racist

214
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:42,736
No!

215
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:44,671
No way, José!

216
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,612
She's suspicious of Asians

217
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,748
Malaysians and Iranians

218
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,817
Kenyans and Indonesians

219
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,548
But she'll bend it for Belgians

220
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,886
She's suspicious of Asians

221
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,958
Malaysians and Iranians

222
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,062
Kenyans and Indonesians

223
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,997
But she'll bend it for Belgians

224
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,774
before the Eure
you're cutting it fine

225
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,978
after the Eure
you've crossed the line

226
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,457
What in God's name is that?

227
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:26,708
Roland!

228
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,835
Agatha and Hervé are here!

229
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,404
You're in luck.

230
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:34,513
The weather forecast is marvellous!

231
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:35,817
Hello.

232
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,780
Hello, darling.

233
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:43,323
How's my honey-bunch?

234
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:46,327
What's Before the Eure
you're cutting it fine?

235
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,693
The county council
thought that one up.

236
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:49,560
What for?

237
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,360
To mark the county boundary.

238
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:53,435
- No one will understand.
- No?

239
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:56,597
No way!
The colour c0de is meaningless!

240
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:59,607
- It's not even funny.
- It makes us laugh.

241
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:00,908
Is it permanent?

242
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,011
I don't know.

243
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,678
Me neither.

244
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:05,479
And you, Hervé?

245
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:06,776
What do you think?

246
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,015
Do you like it or not?

247
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,650
Well, er...

248
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,360
You'ra embarrassing him.

249
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,707
Can't they Iower the volume
during lunch?

250
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,040
They're so sweet.

251
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,747
He's a clever little monkey.

252
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:41,579
Children make noise,
that's how it is.

253
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:43,448
You'll see for yourself one day.

254
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,555
That's not on the agenda.

255
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:47,548
We'd like to be grandparents.

256
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:50,694
A chubby young rascal
A Normandy boy

257
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,387
Or a cute little girl
Our pride and joy

258
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,965
It's not the right time
More haste less speed

259
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,892
Starting a family

260
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,595
Is not what I need

261
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,531
My honey-bunch mine

262
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,337
It's never the time
For a baby

263
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,878
My honey-bunch mine
It's never the time

264
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:12,949
And after the time
You've crossed the line

265
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,847
And before the time
You're cutting it fine

266
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,579
How about you, Harvé lad?

267
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,849
Don't you want to be a dad?

268
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,825
I think Agatha is quite right

269
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,623
We don't have time
to be up all night

270
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,531
I aim to be financially reliable

271
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:35,434
Before envisaging family survival

272
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:38,075
It's never the time
For a baby

273
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,638
It's never the time
For a baby

274
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,707
And don't forget it ain't no fun

275
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,542
To have an ageing dad and mum

276
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:48,879
It's never the time
For a baby

277
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:01,297
Stop!

278
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,103
Not now.

279
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,799
Her professional fulfilment
is at stake.

280
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:11,964
Right, honey-bunch?

281
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,366
Don't you start!

282
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:14,375
Start what?

283
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,945
Calling her honey-bunch.

284
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,312
She hates it.

285
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,015
Don't you, honey-bunch?

286
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:27,955
Lucie!

287
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,325
Could you get me some Paracetamol?

288
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:33,327
Of course.

289
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:35,696
Excuse me.

290
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:36,866
0u'ra radiant.

291
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:38,798
Thank you.

292
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,804
Did you meet the two guys
with the CVs?

293
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:43,599
Yes.

294
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,367
Schmit lool<s interesting.

295
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,511
I told him to call up and meet you.

296
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:48,645
And the other one?

297
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:49,675
He's sound.

298
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,111
OK, but with an equivalent CV

299
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,476
he wanted 500 euros more.
I suggested he reassess.

300
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,721
- He wouldn't back down.
- Forget it.

301
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:01,756
Anything wrong?

302
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,393
Paracetamol...

303
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:07,097
I set up her appointments.
She never met him.

304
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,831
Course not, he's black.

305
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:09,966
It's disgusting.

306
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:13,660
We've all seen her do it
but we can't catch her out.

307
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,703
She'll say you didn't know

308
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:18,899
but she met him outside,
something like that.

309
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,541
- How disgusting.
- Go eat elsewhere!

310
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:23,812
No, sorry.

311
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:27,914
Hello?

312
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:30,315
- Hello, honey-bunch.
- Don't call me that.

313
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:31,614
Hello, Miss Agatha.

314
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,085
Sorry. Where are you?

315
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:34,390
At the Arabs'.

316
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:35,082
Where?

317
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:37,452
At the grocer's.

318
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,587
I've just wrapped up my Koreans!

319
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:41,595
Can I come over?

320
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:42,960
No. Not tonight.

321
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,466
Sweeten up, I feel like it!

322
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,901
Ara you deaf? I said not tonightl

323
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:48,970
What's wrong?

324
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:49,833
Nothing.

325
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,840
Sorry. I feel a bit queasy.

326
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,975
Feverish?

327
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,873
I don't know. I'm shattered.

328
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:56,911
Maybe you should see a doctor?

329
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,580
Maybe. ..

330
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,516
Shall I come over?

331
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:02,675
No!

332
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,750
To fix you a meal and pamper you.

333
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:09,325
You're sweet
but I have a lot of work.

334
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,462
Let's talk before beddy-byes?

335
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:12,425
Right.

336
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:14,024
- Kiss kiss?
- Kiss kiss.

337
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,623
Hello, Miss Agatha.

338
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:17,961
What a tan!

339
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:19,467
Been in the sun?

340
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,627
Speak for yourself.

341
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:44,026
You lool< stunning!

342
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,296
Don't, I feel lousy.

343
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:47,760
You don't lool< it.

344
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:49,595
Been to the Seychelles?

345
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,393
Am I that brown?

346
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:52,535
No!

347
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:55,064
Where were you?

348
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,338
Nowhere.

349
00:19:58,698 --> 00:19:59,802
UV tanning, huh?

350
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,069
You must be nuts.

351
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,545
Come 0ff it.

352
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,674
And my sister's a Beatle.

353
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,644
Go easy with those UV sessions.

354
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:18,823
Your holiday was a waste of time.

355
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,621
You're badly run down.

356
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,657
Did I go on holiday?

357
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:23,833
I don't know.

358
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,433
How do you lool< so healthy?

359
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:28,537
I don't know.

360
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:32,633
Doctors are like lawyers.
We can't help you if you lie.

361
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,778
I swear I don't do anything.

362
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:39,708
Everyone says that.
I know I'm tanned

363
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:42,375
but I haven't sunbathed for 5 years!

364
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:46,421
I workin beauty care,
I know what UV and sunrays can do!

365
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,557
I'm not mad.

366
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,561
I'm sending you to a dermatologist.

367
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:56,898
It's not a haemocyanin.

368
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,032
Or an icterus.

369
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,764
- Is your hair going frizzy?
- Yes.

370
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:08,302
You haven't tested out
a new product?

371
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:11,346
- Instant tan creams or pills?
- No.

372
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,817
Any coloured people in your family?

373
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:18,751
No.

374
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:21,454
Why do you ask?

375
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,094
We could have envisaged
jumping genes.

376
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:27,591
As YOU Qét browner,
you feel more nauseous?

377
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:28,823
- More exhausted?
- Yes.

378
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,803
I'm sending you
to an endocrinologist.

379
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:40,810
You have Addison's Disease.

380
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,071
What's that?

381
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:44,437
A rare condition.

382
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:45,775
I've 0nly come across

383
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:48,851
8 dozen CBSGS in twenty-five Y€8l'S.

384
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:51,017
But what is it?

385
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,016
A disorder
of the adrenal cortax glands.

386
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,848
Exhaustion, stomach aches,
darkening of the skin.

387
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:57,824
The suprarenal insufficiency

388
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:01,487
affects the pituitary gland
and triggers 0ff a melanoderma.

389
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:02,632
Is it serious?

390
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,062
It used to kill people.

391
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,735
No need to worry.

392
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:10,305
Now cortisone exists
people live with it very well.

393
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:11,840
Kennedy for instance.

394
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:14,568
Kennedy had Addison's Disease.

395
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:18,381
But it didn't stop him
being assassinated!

396
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:22,878
I don't understand.
What does it do exactly?

397
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,113
Thanks to cortisone, nothing.

398
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:28,425
You have to survey the doses
to avoid problems.

399
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:31,994
The 0nly visible aspect
is a suntan all year round.

400
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:33,862
In your case,

401
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,693
your ACTH level

402
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,996
is exceptionally high.

403
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:45,098
So your skin
may darken considerably.

404
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:48,742
How do you mean darken?

405
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:53,407
You will probably
darken to the shade

406
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:54,943
of a coloured person.

407
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:57,315
What colour?

408
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,687
Swarthy, olive,

409
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,621
I can't say exactly.

410
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:06,286
Ebony if your melanin level

411
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:07,954
keeps shooting up like this.

412
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,463
I really don't know.

413
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:12,493
- You're kidding?
- Kiss your white skin goodbye.

414
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:15,361
You'll be nothing
like the normal colour

415
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:17,371
for a Caucasian.

416
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,905
Can't it be treated?

417
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,404
Not this aspect of the condition.

418
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,450
So I'll be black?

419
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:29,745
You will darken.

420
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:33,523
For ever?

421
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:37,324
As medical knowledge
stands today, yes.

422
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:39,660
But don't worry, as I said,

423
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:40,922
apart from

424
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,532
the pigmentation,
you can live a normal life.

425
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:46,568
I'm turning black,
is that a normal life?

426
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:51,102
Listen,

427
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,034
if you need to talk to someone

428
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,811
there's an Addison's Disease
Support Group.

429
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,958
Black is black

430
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:21,736
You're turning black

431
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:26,502
It sets you apart

432
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:30,940
It's so rare and new

433
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:34,579
But don't lose heart

434
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,584
Be d00 be d00

435
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:41,316
We'll be there for you

436
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:44,822
Miss Cléry?

437
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,986
See you in four weeks time?

438
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:58,466
Black is black

439
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:02,604
You're turning black

440
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,373
Black is black

441
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,812
You're turning black

442
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,312
Black is black!

443
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:14,124
You're turning black!

444
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:39,846
But...

445
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,918
Apart from
this pig mentation business,

446
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:44,887
are there any complications?

447
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,352
Isn't that enough?

448
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:50,023
Things that could handicap you
in your daily life?

449
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:51,919
What more do you want?

450
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:53,654
I'm turning black!

451
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,991
Don't you know what it means: black?

452
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:57,857
You don't call it a handicap?

453
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,502
We love you to bits.

454
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,797
But you're talking nonsense.

455
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,803
I don't want to be black.

456
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:06,909
I hate black people!
They're ugly and stupid!

457
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:09,344
They have fat lips and fat arms!

458
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:10,980
- Who does she get it from?
- Mother.

459
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,308
As bad as that?

460
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:14,576
- I won't be like a monkey!
- Afraid so.

461
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:16,675
I won't be like them!

462
00:26:16,842 --> 00:26:19,721
I don't want to be black!
I won't, I won't!

463
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:22,491
My darling.

464
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:24,821
You said it's inevitable.

465
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:27,624
So what's the point of moaning?

466
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:30,630
Better get used to it
BS SOOF1 BS YOU CBT].

467
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:34,061
I'll never be black.
Not as long as I live!

468
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,072
You can't commit suicide.

469
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:37,840
Yes, I can... if I must.

470
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,702
Now come on.

471
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:43,807
Don't be silly.

472
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:56,651
But...

473
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,990
Will you get much darker?

474
00:26:59,318 --> 00:26:59,921
No!

475
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:06,930
That shada's not embarrassing.

476
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:08,666
Thanks a lot!

477
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,932
I didn't mean that, don't be silly.

478
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:13,405
And anyway...

479
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,309
Black, yellow, white...

480
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:19,109
- What does it change?
- Everything.

481
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:20,878
It changes everything.

482
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,451
It's another world!

483
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:23,746
You're still my honey-bunch.

484
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:25,020
Yeah.

485
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:43,437
What's the matter?

486
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:44,335
Nothing.

487
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,499
Why are you staring at me?

488
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:48,036
I'm not.

489
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:52,481
I haven't got darker, have I?

490
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:54,778
No, no.

491
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,942
Have I got a bit whiter?

492
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,648
Well, yes...

493
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:01,447
It's hard to tell.

494
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,860
- Coming to bed?
- No, not right away.

495
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,657
I still have work to do.

496
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:09,891
In a bit.

497
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:26,345
Know why Agatha lool<s
browner and browner?

498
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:29,415
- She owned up to UV sessions.
- Agatha?

499
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:30,986
She's lying.

500
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,088
She has a rare disease.

501
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:36,019
She's turning black.

502
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,062
But how? It's impossible.

503
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,060
It is possible.
It's called Addison's Disease.

504
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:44,992
What is it?

505
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:46,394
I googled it,

506
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,333
it makes your skin go darker.

507
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,531
A bit like Michael Jackson

508
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:52,073
but the other way round.

509
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:55,506
And apparently sha's got it bad!

510
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:57,609
No!

511
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,339
You're kidding?

512
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:01,947
Holy shit!

513
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:04,744
Incredible.

514
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,285
There is a rough justice.

515
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:14,429
I didn't say anything.

516
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:31,879
Agatha!

517
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:34,077
Here's the meeting report.

518
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:35,914
Thank you.

519
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:38,111
Secrets, huh?

520
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:39,818
What?

521
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:41,482
Hat?

522
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:44,050
What hmm?

523
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,286
Who was dead against UV?

524
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:51,395
I read the latest reports,
it's not so bad.

525
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:52,831
In moderation,

526
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:53,992
like everything.

527
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,333
I've exposed my skin so rarely

528
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:58,566
my sun capital is virtually intact.

529
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:00,872
Don't 0verd0 it. It gets ugly.

530
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,541
No fear of that. You know me!

531
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:19,825
Alright?

532
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:21,396
I think so.

533
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:28,569
Your mail.

534
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,608
YOUNG AFRICA

535
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:38,607
MISS EBONY

536
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:49,092
Your level's even higher.

537
00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:52,289
You'll be very, very dark.

538
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:54,795
How about more cortisone?

539
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:57,829
You'll blow up like popcorn.

540
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:00,095
And you won't even be
pOpCOl'I'1 COIOUI'.

541
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:19,387
LIGHTENER

542
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:24,683
WHITENING CREAM

543
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:34,936
Excuse me.

544
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,505
Can I go first? I 0nly have this.

545
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:38,572
Go ahead.

546
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,474
Why me?

547
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:51,450
What have I done

548
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:53,952
To deserve this?

549
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:00,389
It's worse than shame
It's deep distress

550
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:04,732
Making my poor life a mess

551
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:09,296
A dark mess

552
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:14,035
I'm no hard and cruel Miss

553
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:16,911
I just don't want to be

554
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:18,912
A negress!

555
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:23,409
But if Michael's gone whiter

556
00:32:25,077 --> 00:32:27,853
Then I can be lighter

557
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,791
I'll be pearly pale pink

558
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:34,396
As white as an ice rink

559
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:37,032
White as an ice rink

560
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:41,927
I'm telling you
Better believe me

561
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:46,503
Me, Agatha Cléryl

562
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,303
Ary Boubakar.

563
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:51,470
Famous magician from the Savannah.

564
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,048
Diplomas in 0ccult sciences,
high magic.

565
00:32:54,373 --> 00:32:57,115
Discreet advisor
to international politicians.

566
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:58,853
Miracles at a distance.

567
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,012
Speed, efficiency, credibility.

568
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:03,587
Right on the middle of my desk.

569
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:05,425
Why not tell them?

570
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:08,588
Because they know.
And they're doing this.

571
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:10,867
They have no pity. It's vile.

572
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:12,524
Maybe it's not them.

573
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:15,433
- I get sent these.
- C'mon! It's every day.

574
00:33:15,594 --> 00:33:16,664
Poor baby.

575
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:19,074
Have you been to see him?

576
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:20,033
Who?

577
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:22,510
Ary Thingummy.

578
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:23,911
What for?

579
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:25,941
I don't l<now...

580
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:27,447
Me see a witchdoctor?

581
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:30,886
The blacks believe in them.

582
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,646
I am not black.

583
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:34,313
So what are you saying?

584
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:36,584
Break it up, you two. OK?

585
00:33:39,918 --> 00:33:41,829
- I'm sorry.
- My fault. I'm sorry.

586
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:42,795
I'm sorry.

587
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:44,399
Drink up! Good luck!

588
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:45,966
I could use some.

589
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:56,406
Fifty eight, fifty nine, sixty...

590
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,594
But how long are you 0ff for?

591
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,897
You don't know when you'll be back?

592
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,671
I'll have to work round it,

593
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,399
what else can I say?

594
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:00,838
I don't have a choice.

595
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:05,814
Lool< after yourself
and come back soon.

596
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,073
Yeah, me too.

597
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,761
Beautiful day

598
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,328
HGPPY day

599
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,592
Hip hooray

600
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:27,995
Hip hooray

601
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:31,005
At last Agatha

602
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:35,038
Is on her way

603
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,876
Farewell, Agathe

604
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:42,382
Wa'll wave you away

605
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:46,990
Just stay far away

606
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:09,370
gathe?

607
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:10,535
It's us!

608
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:11,772
Open the door!

609
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:31,324
It does change you

610
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:33,969
but honestly, you're still you.

611
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,605
Right. You're still you.

612
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:40,342
But...

613
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:41,476
Is it all over?

614
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:49,513
Just as well,
or it would lool< weird.

615
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,715
I'm getting used to it,

616
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:53,878
really I am.

617
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,620
I don't even notice the difference.

618
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,786
Don't cry.

619
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:02,897
No, don't.

620
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,965
We know you're not really black.

621
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:07,330
No squashy nose or fat lips.

622
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:13,702
Your doctor could be wrong.
Maybe it's temporary.

623
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:15,936
I went to see three others.

624
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:18,103
They all say the same.

625
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,078
What about Harvé?

626
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:22,851
What does he think?

627
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:23,986
Nothing.

628
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:26,322
He doesn't touch me any more,
that's all.

629
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:42,934
Poor thing.

630
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:46,032
Poor Hervé!

631
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:49,707
Lighten up.

632
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:51,547
You gotta laugh!

633
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:21,534
It's me.

634
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:22,438
How are you?

635
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,409
I'm good. How are you?

636
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:26,780
So $0...

637
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:28,039
What's wrong?

638
00:38:28,373 --> 00:38:29,317
Nothing...

639
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,014
Coming over tonight?

640
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:36,548
Not tonight, I really can't.

641
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,557
A deadline for my Koreans.

642
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:39,757
I see.

643
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:41,429
Not mad at me?

644
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,699
No, I can't be mad at you.

645
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:46,767
Well, kiss kiss?

646
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:47,962
Kiss kiss.

647
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:49,434
Good bye.

648
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:00,948
And now, 0ur 0Id friend Nino.

649
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:01,743
Yeah, right!

650
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:04,853
It was back in '66, remember?

651
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:21,403
I'd love to be black

652
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,368
I'd love to be black

653
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:39,081
Black all over

654
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:46,895
Hello?

655
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:49,589
No! It's not true!

656
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:51,626
Roland!

657
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:53,602
Agathe's been silly!

658
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,935
Oxygen.

659
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:04,307
Blood pressure.

660
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:08,883
We are the damned
Of the medical world

661
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,886
Our overtime paid
In blood, sweat and tears

662
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:16,389
No bank credit
No renown

663
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:19,358
We heal when we can
But it grinds us down

664
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,564
Miss Cléry?

665
00:40:23,555 --> 00:40:25,000
Miss Cléryl

666
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:37,772
It's normal.

667
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:43,783
Put her on Zeferil till tonight.

668
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,590
Can't you imagine
what it would have done to us?

669
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:53,688
And your parents?

670
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:55,657
Snap out of it.

671
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,664
It's not as if you'd lost
yOUl' EYES OI' yOUl' IEQS.

672
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,903
You don't have a squashy nose.

673
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,366
What do you sae? A black woman.

674
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:04,529
I'm black.

675
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:06,972
- We know you're not really.
- Piss 0ff.

676
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:08,543
I see a black face.

677
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,077
Everyone does!

678
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:11,636
So what?

679
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,711
How 0ften have we joked
about darkies?

680
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:16,647
Nothing bad.

681
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:19,020
Just for a laugh.

682
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,825
I've been thinking.

683
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,859
- You're the lucky one.
- Yeah?

684
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:29,021
You represent 0ur century
better than we do.

685
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:31,834
Society is evolving
towards racial mixture.

686
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,992
Please! Spare me.

687
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:35,864
He's got a point.

688
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,699
Racial mixture is humanity's future.

689
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:40,570
Mathematically inescapable.

690
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:42,837
Why not Black is beautiful too?

691
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,607
Try it for yourselves
if it's so great.

692
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,545
It's easy for you to talk!

693
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:51,479
I may be humanity's future
but he sleeps on the sofa.

694
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:56,389
You make me sorry I saved you.

695
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,525
Face facts.
Get used to your new identity.

696
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,688
Or don't mess up your next suicide.

697
00:42:04,556 --> 00:42:05,830
Come on. Treatment.

698
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,112
Sucking up?

699
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:23,451
Certainly not.

700
00:42:24,342 --> 00:42:27,915
Trying to top herself
doesn't make har a saint.

701
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,286
It's sad to see someone so low.

702
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,700
Wear something lighter,
it's warm this morning.

703
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,533
I can take it 0ff later.

704
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:47,071
- Like us to come with you?
- No.

705
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:49,577
It's on 0ur way.

706
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,907
I'm not going to nursery school.

707
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:56,718
Just trying to help.

708
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:58,512
Right, I'm 0ff.

709
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,647
Have you got your pills?

710
00:43:00,812 --> 00:43:03,520
Being black doesn't mean
I'm a half-wit.

711
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:06,855
I'm glad to hear you say that.

712
00:43:22,734 --> 00:43:23,940
Hi, girls.

713
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:26,712
Madam! Where are you going?

714
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,317
It's me. Agatha.

715
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,596
Hello, Agatha.

716
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,797
I want to say for us all...

717
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:53,306
We're delighted to see you back.

718
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:54,641
Thank you.

719
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:57,712
You've been through
some testing times, Agatha.

720
00:43:57,869 --> 00:43:59,712
The fighter we know and love

721
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:03,444
has won through 0nce more.

722
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:05,651
Agatha,

723
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:09,947
we're proud to count you
al'T1OI'1QSt US again.

724
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:14,395
And the best way to show us
you haven't changed

725
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,867
is to roll up your sleeves
and get to work!

726
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,530
Attagirl, Agatha!

727
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,702
Get cracking!

728
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:33,880
Agatha.

729
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:38,111
Sorry about all the crap.
We W€l'€ IOUSY tO YOU.

730
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:39,847
That's alright.

731
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:42,389
I'd have found it funny
too normally.

732
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:45,853
Well, that's how it is.

733
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:48,727
But thanks, it's nice of you.

734
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:58,039
That's me!

735
00:45:00,598 --> 00:45:02,544
Good morning.

736
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:06,576
Scandinav is the ideal
solution for all women

737
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:09,548
whose pale complexions
suffer more than darker skins

738
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:12,051
from the aggressions
of today's world.

739
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,855
Pollution, stress,

740
00:45:14,012 --> 00:45:16,925
the disastrous effects of sunlight.

741
00:45:17,682 --> 00:45:19,355
Market research shows. ..

742
00:45:19,517 --> 00:45:20,962
Excuse me...
There's a huge market

743
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:23,965
for Caucasian type complaxions.

744
00:45:24,122 --> 00:45:27,103
So we're launching
a new range of skin care

745
00:45:27,425 --> 00:45:29,405
for pale, sensitive skins.

746
00:45:29,861 --> 00:45:31,863
We've called it Scandinav.

747
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:33,434
As these white skins

748
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:35,467
are more delicate,

749
00:45:35,633 --> 00:45:37,442
thay'ra also more fragile

750
00:45:37,602 --> 00:45:40,412
and the da mage
is always appalling...

751
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:33,034
What brings you here?

752
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:37,370
Do you thinl<...

753
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:39,064
I've been wondering...

754
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:42,835
I'm not sure I'm the right person
for Scandinav.

755
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:47,443
What do you mean?

756
00:46:47,605 --> 00:46:51,781
Well, with my...

757
00:46:51,943 --> 00:46:52,921
Because of my. ..

758
00:46:54,612 --> 00:46:57,525
Good God! It never crossed my mind!

759
00:46:57,882 --> 00:46:59,657
It hadn't occurred to me.

760
00:46:59,884 --> 00:47:00,862
Really?

761
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:03,496
You're not serious?

762
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:05,092
No, but...

763
00:47:05,623 --> 00:47:07,330
What a pity you think that.

764
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:10,598
Yes, but if that's how she feels...

765
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:15,570
Scared you've lost your motivation?

766
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:17,770
Who wouldn't in your situation?

767
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:19,605
Attagirl Agatha!

768
00:47:20,538 --> 00:47:21,710
No, Agatha

769
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:23,715
You must follow your heart

770
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:26,411
You're at the peak of your art

771
00:47:26,978 --> 00:47:29,049
So retire on the crest of the wave

772
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,324
Be brave

773
00:47:30,548 --> 00:47:33,586
We accept with regret
Your resignation

774
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:37,460
We'll return your stock option

775
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:40,525
We respect

776
00:47:41,659 --> 00:47:43,502
Your decision

777
00:47:43,661 --> 00:47:46,767
FOI' those many Y€8l'S

778
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:48,740
Of commitment and loyalty

779
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,405
We'll reward you with

780
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:56,682
A handsome indemnity

781
00:47:58,376 --> 00:47:59,946
We must start anew

782
00:48:01,412 --> 00:48:03,517
We'll miss you too

783
00:48:03,748 --> 00:48:05,318
That's very true

784
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:07,790
We'll miss you

785
00:48:08,419 --> 00:48:10,797
Goodbye Agatha

786
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:16,330
Don't say thank you

787
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:20,536
It's the least we can do

788
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:23,334
We 0we you that too

789
00:48:23,768 --> 00:48:26,305
Goodbye Agatha

790
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:27,847
You're a true blue

791
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:30,315
We'll miss you

792
00:48:35,813 --> 00:48:36,848
That was closa!

793
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:39,051
She made it easy for us.

794
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:41,427
Shame.

795
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:43,532
I got horny with her black.

796
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,039
Miss Cléry.

797
00:48:56,934 --> 00:49:00,541
I don't want to interfere,
but the body corporate

798
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:04,880
isn't happy about renewing
your lease, I hear.

799
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:07,386
Really? Why not?

800
00:49:08,479 --> 00:49:11,858
I think it's something
to do with your new... colour.

801
00:49:14,752 --> 00:49:16,493
We immigrants must stick together.

802
00:49:16,654 --> 00:49:17,997
Thank you, Mrs Goebbels.

803
00:49:35,406 --> 00:49:36,510
Agatha, my dearest,

804
00:49:36,741 --> 00:49:39,984
I'm not strong enough
to see you through this ordeal.

805
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:41,122
Forgive me.

806
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:42,981
You're still my honey-bunch.

807
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:44,285
Your Hervé

808
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:48,291
PS. I hope with all my heart
you'll be white again 0na day.

809
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:49,624
So do I.

810
00:50:01,632 --> 00:50:03,805
You're right,
it's great to be black.

811
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,845
I've lost my job and my fella,

812
00:50:07,405 --> 00:50:09,510
now I'm being kicked out of my home.

813
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:13,554
Surely you saw it coming with Hervé?

814
00:50:14,612 --> 00:50:15,488
No.

815
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,785
You said
he hadn't touched you for weeks.

816
00:50:20,885 --> 00:50:21,625
Well, no...

817
00:50:21,786 --> 00:50:23,026
This way, please.

818
00:50:27,325 --> 00:50:28,326
See that?

819
00:50:28,793 --> 00:50:30,466
He tool< them in before me.

820
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,932
Don't be paranoid. They booked.

821
00:50:33,998 --> 00:50:37,468
And if the Guinards fired you
because you're black

822
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:39,809
it could cost them a fortune.

823
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:42,041
2·Y€8l' S€F1t€F1C€,
45,000 euro fine.

824
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:45,354
If you're sure of your facts,
sue them.

825
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:47,917
Yeah. I can be a Black Panther now.

826
00:50:48,112 --> 00:50:50,922
I'm not suing anyone.
I'd have done the same.

827
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:52,492
And gone to jail!

828
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:55,062
I did it ten times over,
no problem.

829
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:56,330
Our turn now.

830
00:50:58,689 --> 00:51:01,067
Did the people before us
bool< a table?

831
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:02,462
Yes, Madam.

832
00:51:03,928 --> 00:51:05,305
I bet he's lying.

833
00:51:20,978 --> 00:51:23,356
I'm not black, I'm sick.

834
00:51:23,514 --> 00:51:24,857
I'm from Normandy!

835
00:51:47,405 --> 00:51:49,009
JOB CENTRE

836
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:25,587
Climb back up your coconut tree!

837
00:52:25,743 --> 00:52:26,813
Stupid cow!

838
00:52:45,029 --> 00:52:45,939
Hello?

839
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:48,869
Roland.

840
00:52:49,867 --> 00:52:52,006
- Mum?
- Yes, darling?

841
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:01,951
Thank you for coming.

842
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:03,318
What's happened?

843
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:05,725
She's not in good shape...

844
00:53:05,883 --> 00:53:07,385
I'll lead the way.

845
00:53:12,056 --> 00:53:13,729
What are you doing here?

846
00:53:13,891 --> 00:53:15,529
After-sales service.

847
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:19,937
What for? Life is a groove!

848
00:53:20,731 --> 00:53:23,610
You've lost everything,
it can 0nly get better.

849
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:25,440
Sorry but no!

850
00:53:25,603 --> 00:53:27,605
My last few friends can dump me,

851
00:53:28,105 --> 00:53:31,450
my parents can cut me 0ff,
my hotel room can be torched

852
00:53:31,609 --> 00:53:33,520
now that I can't rant an apartment!

853
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:35,350
Don't talk rubbish.

854
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:38,015
They can fly me to the border!
Sell me as a slave!

855
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:40,727
Lots more fun things can happen!

856
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:42,692
- Are you through?
- No!

857
00:53:42,853 --> 00:53:44,833
I said not in good shape.

858
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:45,763
Fuck 0ff!

859
00:53:45,923 --> 00:53:47,368
- Anything else?
- I've had it!

860
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:48,559
Go on. Let it out.

861
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,500
Black is a shitty colour!

862
00:53:50,661 --> 00:53:54,973
Perfect. Talking of colour,
we have issues. That's unwearable.

863
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:09,516
We'll start with clothes

864
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,284
Don't need clothes

865
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:12,518
- This?
- No!

866
00:54:12,883 --> 00:54:14,089
- That?
- No!

867
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:19,500
Perfect!

868
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,903
Now for shoes

869
00:54:23,127 --> 00:54:25,539
Don't know my size

870
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:39,547
Perfect!

871
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:43,347
Let that 0Id pain go

872
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:49,894
Enjoy your inky glow

873
00:54:53,924 --> 00:54:56,803
Groove with our gentle flow

874
00:54:57,461 --> 00:55:00,408
Just be happy

875
00:55:00,831 --> 00:55:04,108
It's been over two hours

876
00:55:04,435 --> 00:55:07,314
Make an effort, fight depression

877
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:10,475
This is not a torture session

878
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:14,350
You lool< fabulous, Agatha dear

879
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:16,821
This'll go down as

880
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:21,451
Your watershed year

881
00:55:33,964 --> 00:55:35,671
What a beautiful black woman!

882
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:38,738
Some compliment!

883
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,339
You are a stupid bitch.

884
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:44,450
Sorry.

885
00:55:45,776 --> 00:55:47,915
Now you're presentable,
go get a job.

886
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:49,585
Move your ass!

887
00:55:51,415 --> 00:55:52,951
And keep in touch!

888
00:56:15,973 --> 00:56:17,509
Miss Cléry?

889
00:56:18,609 --> 00:56:19,952
No, that's me.

890
00:56:22,613 --> 00:56:23,683
Delighted to meet you.

891
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:25,758
Jean-Charles Lajoignie.

892
00:56:26,684 --> 00:56:28,027
This way, please.

893
00:56:42,032 --> 00:56:44,444
Fine track record, good diplomas.

894
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:48,344
I sae you're Sagittarius,
like my mother!

895
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:51,613
No, really...

896
00:56:52,943 --> 00:56:55,924
And you're available? Sure?

897
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:00,323
I'm sorry, the woman
who was due for maternity laava...

898
00:57:00,684 --> 00:57:01,458
Is staying on.

899
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:05,466
She's not taking maternity leave?

900
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:09,097
No. It's such a pity.

901
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,411
Sophie? Agatha Cléry to see you.

902
00:57:25,576 --> 00:57:26,611
I'm coming.

903
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:31,983
Hello.

904
00:57:32,316 --> 00:57:34,353
Agatha Cléry, nice to meet you.

905
00:57:34,518 --> 00:57:35,326
Sophie Valois.

906
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:37,425
Do come in.

907
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:39,790
Sit down.

908
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:47,101
Lool<, I'm in a bit 0fa spot...

909
00:57:47,531 --> 00:57:49,010
I don't know what happened,

910
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:52,470
obviously the information
didn't circulate...

911
00:57:53,704 --> 00:57:55,081
The job's been taken.

912
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:56,976
How about that.

913
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:59,719
You have an excellent CV.

914
00:58:01,111 --> 00:58:05,560
But I've had to bow down
to the boss's candidate.

915
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:08,492
Divine right, you know.

916
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,025
I don't believe a word
of your story.

917
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:14,465
I've trotted it out too often.

918
00:58:14,624 --> 00:58:17,434
I'm not racist,
the problem is 0ur clients.

919
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:19,002
No, absolutely not!

920
00:58:20,097 --> 00:58:21,838
Or you'll call me a week later

921
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:24,309
to say you've taken on someone else

922
00:58:24,468 --> 00:58:27,881
but my colour isn't an issueu.
as she's coloured too!

923
00:58:28,705 --> 00:58:29,775
Or stand me up

924
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:32,682
for an important meeting.
Or feel unwell.

925
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:34,880
No really, you're quite wrong...

926
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:37,482
I was white too.

927
00:58:42,786 --> 00:58:43,662
Good bye.

928
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:45,599
Stupid bitch.

929
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:51,901
What happened?

930
00:58:53,564 --> 00:58:54,702
She's mad.

931
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:57,703
Not the right career profile,

932
00:58:57,868 --> 00:59:00,371
Sorry, job taken,
Not the right profile,

933
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,778
Thank you, Miss Cléry.
Good luck!

934
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:06,954
Don't exaggerate, it's not
always because you're black.

935
00:59:07,444 --> 00:59:10,391
In SOI'T1€ CBSGS YOU may not
have the right skills.

936
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:13,391
You know many people
as unskilled as me?

937
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,927
Who handled Scandinav?

938
00:59:15,085 --> 00:59:17,531
Who was made marketing director?

939
00:59:17,688 --> 00:59:19,326
Believe me, it's racism!

940
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,765
You're not going out like that?

941
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,337
- Not everyone is racist.
- They are!

942
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:29,499
- No! I'm not.
- Come 0ff it!

943
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:32,545
Maybe I was a tiny bit
but not any more.

944
00:59:32,703 --> 00:59:35,912
Yes, I'm your token black.
For your WASP conscience.

945
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:37,950
And because you knew me before.

946
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:42,612
I don't know what I hate most.
People pitying me or despising me.

947
00:59:47,351 --> 00:59:48,489
OK. Shall we go?

948
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,956
I can't take it any more.

949
00:59:51,121 --> 00:59:54,364
It'll work out. Don't lose hope.

950
00:59:54,525 --> 00:59:55,902
Don't talk about hope.

951
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:58,869
Cioran said:
Hope is a virtue for slaves.

952
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:04,776
I don't know if I'm racist
but you're a pain!

953
01:00:05,402 --> 01:00:08,576
Your My people have
suffered enough attitude

954
01:00:08,739 --> 01:00:10,446
is getting unbearable.

955
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:14,984
Am I like that?

956
01:00:16,413 --> 01:00:17,323
A bit.

957
01:00:18,582 --> 01:00:19,652
A bit or a lot?

958
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:21,952
A bit of a lot.

959
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,900
See, you are racist.

960
01:00:30,427 --> 01:00:31,098
Let's go.

961
01:00:35,399 --> 01:00:37,504
It's too crowded. Let's go home.

962
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:38,509
Don't move.

963
01:00:38,669 --> 01:00:40,876
- I don't feel like dancing.
- Liar.

964
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,550
Anyway he won't let me in.

965
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:48,019
Don't talk crap.
He'll let you in, he's black.

966
01:00:48,345 --> 01:00:49,915
That's why he's outside.

967
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,354
You're out of date.

968
01:00:51,515 --> 01:00:53,825
Clubs don't turn black people away.

969
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:55,429
You're being na'l've.

970
01:00:55,586 --> 01:00:57,691
Arabs maybe. But not blacks.

971
01:00:57,854 --> 01:00:59,458
Sure they do.

972
01:00:59,623 --> 01:01:01,034
Let them through, please.

973
01:01:10,634 --> 01:01:13,478
How long have they
been together? Tell me!

974
01:01:13,637 --> 01:01:17,483
She tool< out an option the day
you said he didn't touch you.

975
01:01:17,641 --> 01:01:19,018
What a bitch!

976
01:01:19,543 --> 01:01:22,080
That's ages ago.
And you never told me.

977
01:01:22,646 --> 01:01:23,522
Come on!

978
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:27,293
The bitch!

979
01:01:33,123 --> 01:01:35,364
Don't lool< so grim.

980
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,636
White people get cheated on too.

981
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:42,334
You'll make yourself ill.

982
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,383
I warned you.

983
01:01:51,608 --> 01:01:53,019
Shall I come with you?

984
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:39,459
Wow! I never knew
you could dance like that.

985
01:03:40,116 --> 01:03:40,958
It's normal.

986
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:43,326
I got rhythm in my blood.

987
01:04:10,514 --> 01:04:11,390
Hello?

988
01:04:11,548 --> 01:04:12,788
Did I wake you?

989
01:04:14,384 --> 01:04:16,523
I knew it! Seen the time?

990
01:04:17,454 --> 01:04:18,558
Shit!

991
01:04:18,722 --> 01:04:20,633
I said don't drink too much.

992
01:04:20,791 --> 01:04:21,963
Who wanted to go out?

993
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:24,366
You didn't have
to drink like a fish!

994
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:28,869
If I hadn't gone out
I wouldn't have seen those two.

995
01:04:29,132 --> 01:04:30,736
OK, it's my fault.

996
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,072
Get a move on!

997
01:04:32,936 --> 01:04:36,577
Why? I'll 0nly get turned down.
There's no point going.

998
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:38,310
So don't go.

999
01:04:38,475 --> 01:04:39,818
COI'T1€ OF], hUl'l'Y Up.

1000
01:05:10,507 --> 01:05:13,044
Hello. I have an appointment
with Mr Lambert.

1001
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:14,514
He's not here.

1002
01:05:15,479 --> 01:05:15,980
Thanks. Bye.

1003
01:05:16,146 --> 01:05:18,092
Wait! Who are you?

1004
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:20,486
What's that to you?

1005
01:05:22,052 --> 01:05:23,429
Agatha Cléry.

1006
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:29,737
Isa? Miss Cléry is
at reception for Quentin.

1007
01:05:30,327 --> 01:05:30,998
Alright.

1008
01:05:32,529 --> 01:05:34,509
Left, than through
the 0pan plan area.

1009
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:37,440
Mr Salaoui's assistant
will meet you.

1010
01:05:39,536 --> 01:05:40,446
Turn left...

1011
01:05:41,905 --> 01:05:43,509
I got it. Thanks.

1012
01:05:58,021 --> 01:05:58,726
Miss Cléry?

1013
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:02,099
I'm Isabelle Plesh,
Mr Salaoui's PA.

1014
01:06:02,425 --> 01:06:04,029
- Who's Mr Salaoui?
- The IVID.

1015
01:06:04,361 --> 01:06:06,637
He's number 2,
Quentin Lambert is president.

1016
01:06:11,768 --> 01:06:13,543
Kader, your appointment.

1017
01:06:15,572 --> 01:06:17,950
- Hello.
- Hello. Do sit down.

1018
01:06:18,108 --> 01:06:20,349
Would you like coffee? Tea?

1019
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:22,046
No, thank you.

1020
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:24,483
- Some water?
- I'm fine, thanks.

1021
01:06:24,648 --> 01:06:26,958
Right. I'll make it brief.

1022
01:06:27,117 --> 01:06:29,757
We're an IT service company,
specializing

1023
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:32,661
in intranet/extranet,
the whole net thing.

1024
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:36,395
We provide site creation, advice,

1025
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:40,637
we're developing programmes
for 3G phones, 4G,

1026
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:42,609
5G... The future!

1027
01:06:42,766 --> 01:06:47,340
So we're lool<ing
for a marketing director.

1028
01:06:47,938 --> 01:06:50,441
You were in cosmetics,
then you resigned?

1029
01:06:51,441 --> 01:06:53,580
No, I didn't exactly resign,

1030
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:55,723
we parted by mutual agreement.

1031
01:06:56,713 --> 01:06:57,714
Why?

1032
01:06:58,114 --> 01:07:00,651
I felt I'd gone
as far as I could go.

1033
01:07:00,817 --> 01:07:03,923
And although
they appreciated my worl<...

1034
01:07:05,922 --> 01:07:07,765
They were up for a new face.

1035
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:10,699
Been job hunting for long?

1036
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,938
Too long.

1037
01:07:13,463 --> 01:07:15,409
Had a lot of hits?

1038
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:18,112
No. A lot of rejections.

1039
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:20,503
Why?

1040
01:07:20,904 --> 01:07:21,974
Why do you think?

1041
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:25,813
I don't know.
Maybe you weren't suitable?

1042
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:26,885
That's for sure.

1043
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:30,388
But my qualifications
wererft the issue.

1044
01:07:30,547 --> 01:07:32,288
- What was?
- My new...

1045
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:34,291
Sorry. My colour.

1046
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:42,029
WSIVS 8 YOUFIQ COITIDBFIY.
Quentin Lambert started it.

1047
01:07:42,359 --> 01:07:45,670
He's like you: loads of diplomas,
Ioads of rejections.

1048
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:47,102
Because he's black.

1049
01:07:47,764 --> 01:07:50,005
So he came to a logical conclusion.

1050
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:52,836
We live in a society that's always

1051
01:07:53,002 --> 01:07:55,710
been run by and for white people.

1052
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:59,046
So he decided to create
this company to promote,

1053
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:02,948
help and employ everyone else.
And wa'ra increasing daily.

1054
01:08:04,781 --> 01:08:06,317
No white people?

1055
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:08,053
None. Zero. But don't worry.

1056
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:11,831
We function the same,
with the same markets and targets.

1057
01:08:11,988 --> 01:08:15,561
But since they don't want us,
we don't want them.

1058
01:08:15,725 --> 01:08:17,602
- Do you mind?
- Not a bit.

1059
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,502
On the contrary. I'm not bothered.

1060
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:23,900
Nor are we.
But we don't want them.

1061
01:08:24,067 --> 01:08:26,047
You're right. Me neither.

1062
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:28,912
When can you start?

1063
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:36,015
You see? Never lose hope!

1064
01:08:36,346 --> 01:08:37,950
You know why I got the job?

1065
01:08:38,648 --> 01:08:39,991
Because you're black?

1066
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:41,488
Right on the money!

1067
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:44,657
Positive discrimination?

1068
01:08:44,821 --> 01:08:47,461
In this case,
negative discrimination.

1069
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:48,625
What do you mean?

1070
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:51,500
They won't hire anyone who's white.

1071
01:08:51,661 --> 01:08:52,696
No?

1072
01:08:53,696 --> 01:08:55,437
- Like I said.
- No white people?

1073
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:56,440
No.

1074
01:08:56,599 --> 01:08:57,805
What do they do?

1075
01:08:58,034 --> 01:09:00,947
Internet/intranet operations
for various companies.

1076
01:09:01,771 --> 01:09:03,011
Not one white person?

1077
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:04,045
No.

1078
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:05,884
And they function?

1079
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:08,355
Just asking.

1080
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:10,320
They doubled their turnover.

1081
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:11,424
Fair enough.

1082
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:13,889
Are you up for it?

1083
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:15,529
Sure I'm up for it.

1084
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:18,864
Pray they don't find out
I'm not really black.

1085
01:09:19,022 --> 01:09:20,592
You have a point!

1086
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:31,344
Miss Cléryl

1087
01:09:33,036 --> 01:09:35,778
This gentleman wanted
to ask me about you.

1088
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:37,680
I didn't say a word!

1089
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,719
I'm Mr Flin, Mr Ozares' attorney.

1090
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:44,825
My client informed me
you have undergone a...

1091
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:48,691
Genetic transformation?

1092
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:52,294
Nothing genetic about it.

1093
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:55,093
But physically...

1094
01:09:55,892 --> 01:09:57,428
You've changed radically?

1095
01:10:00,597 --> 01:10:01,667
What of it?

1096
01:10:01,831 --> 01:10:04,607
If the guarantees
you offered Mr Ozares

1097
01:10:04,768 --> 01:10:06,941
were sound enough at the time

1098
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:09,583
for him to lat his apartment to you,

1099
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:12,512
what is the situation today,

1100
01:10:13,009 --> 01:10:14,647
now you're someone else?

1101
01:10:16,112 --> 01:10:18,456
What is the question exactly?

1102
01:10:18,781 --> 01:10:20,988
Since you're no longer the same,

1103
01:10:22,018 --> 01:10:24,362
the question we ask is whether...

1104
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:27,000
Your lease is renewable?

1105
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:33,472
Go ask yourself that question.

1106
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:57,864
Come back when I've barbequed
a sheep after an excision!

1107
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:02,065
That was 0na of my cliant's fears.

1108
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:05,472
Any more shit and I'll eat him raw.

1109
01:11:05,628 --> 01:11:06,732
And you too!

1110
01:11:32,822 --> 01:11:34,597
I need a report on their products

1111
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:37,897
and a rundown of the competition.

1112
01:11:38,328 --> 01:11:41,002
And in case
they try to beat us to it,

1113
01:11:41,331 --> 01:11:43,641
I'd like to be ready by next month.

1114
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,108
Can I have something...

1115
01:11:45,435 --> 01:11:46,709
Let's say Thursday?

1116
01:11:47,937 --> 01:11:50,781
- Wednesday if you like.
- Great.

1117
01:11:52,876 --> 01:11:54,480
- Excuse me.
- No problem.

1118
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:55,452
We've finished.

1119
01:11:55,612 --> 01:11:57,922
- Coming for lunch?
- Right away.

1120
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:02,592
Here's the blurb on video functions
and high speed link ups.

1121
01:12:02,752 --> 01:12:03,730
Good.

1122
01:12:04,354 --> 01:12:06,391
We'll get there, you'll see.

1123
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,746
Move your black ass, bitch.

1124
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:21,878
- Think that's funny?
- Yes.

1125
01:12:22,038 --> 01:12:23,881
- Well?
- Well what?

1126
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:25,815
How's things with your darkies?

1127
01:12:25,975 --> 01:12:27,454
- Bad.
- C'mon!

1128
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:31,854
Anti-white racial discrimination
in France today is a scandal.

1129
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:32,890
Hand in your notice.

1130
01:12:33,049 --> 01:12:35,051
No, but I haven't said my last word.

1131
01:12:35,385 --> 01:12:37,763
Not more of your crap. Chillout.

1132
01:12:37,921 --> 01:12:38,991
What's the movie?

1133
01:12:39,322 --> 01:12:40,824
A classic, you'll like it.

1134
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:45,439
Guess who's coming to dinner?

1135
01:12:45,595 --> 01:12:46,665
Social life:

1136
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:49,469
the rise you expect
is a long way 0ff.

1137
01:12:49,632 --> 01:12:52,806
Heart: the desert crossing
has just begun.

1138
01:12:52,969 --> 01:12:54,414
A load of bullshit.

1139
01:12:54,571 --> 01:12:57,575
- So why did you ask me to read it?
- I didn't.

1140
01:12:57,941 --> 01:12:59,648
- Hello, Mr Lambert!
- Hello.

1141
01:12:59,809 --> 01:13:03,052
Gemini. Social life:
you'll send out sparks.

1142
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:06,451
Heart: love at first sight
is close at hand.

1143
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:09,931
So's your dismissal
if you don't answer that.

1144
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,324
- How did it go?
- Good, thanks.

1145
01:13:12,956 --> 01:13:14,594
- Jetlagged?
- Slept on the plane.

1146
01:13:14,757 --> 01:13:16,532
- How's New Delhi?
- Magnificent.

1147
01:13:16,693 --> 01:13:18,434
The Indians not too tricksy?

1148
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:19,595
No more than you!

1149
01:13:20,463 --> 01:13:23,034
- Hi, Quentin.
- Hi. Work, work!

1150
01:13:23,366 --> 01:13:24,367
Hey, Quentin!

1151
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:36,880
Quentin, meet Agatha Cléry,
0ur new marketing director.

1152
01:13:37,046 --> 01:13:39,617
Agathe, meet Quentin Lambert,
your boss.

1153
01:13:39,782 --> 01:13:40,954
Good to meet you.

1154
01:15:06,736 --> 01:15:08,079
They read it to me,

1155
01:15:08,404 --> 01:15:09,712
but I didn't believe it.

1156
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:10,976
Me neither,

1157
01:15:11,574 --> 01:15:13,019
but it was written.

1158
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:20,285
Love at first sight!

1159
01:15:36,566 --> 01:15:38,045
A kiss.

1160
01:15:47,677 --> 01:15:49,486
- I can't get over it!
- Over what?

1161
01:15:49,645 --> 01:15:50,623
Over what?

1162
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:52,987
If I'd heard it six months ago:

1163
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:56,425
you black
and in love with a black guy!

1164
01:15:56,853 --> 01:15:58,355
I've never been so happy.

1165
01:16:01,024 --> 01:16:02,628
- What?
- Nothing.

1166
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:06,030
You should tidy up this mess.

1167
01:16:07,864 --> 01:16:09,366
Do they have huge 0nes?

1168
01:16:10,866 --> 01:16:12,345
So that's it!

1169
01:16:12,502 --> 01:16:14,880
- Everyone says they do.
- I don't know.

1170
01:16:15,338 --> 01:16:16,783
I haven't sean that many.

1171
01:16:16,939 --> 01:16:18,941
Compared to Herve for instance?

1172
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:22,412
It takes two.
And we fuck fantastically.

1173
01:16:24,347 --> 01:16:25,826
Fantastically better than Hervé?

1174
01:16:25,982 --> 01:16:29,896
No comparison. With Hervé
it was hygienic. This is magic.

1175
01:16:30,053 --> 01:16:31,589
Because it's bigger?

1176
01:16:33,356 --> 01:16:36,337
It hits the spot. Satisfied?

1177
01:16:37,026 --> 01:16:41,532
Find one for yourself, any size,
and stop fantasizing.

1178
01:17:22,905 --> 01:17:26,512
When I see lovers like them

1179
01:17:26,675 --> 01:17:30,851
My heart skips a beat

1180
01:17:31,013 --> 01:17:35,086
But we're too 0Id
For that sexy treat

1181
01:17:35,418 --> 01:17:39,662
It's sooner than you suppose
The menopause

1182
01:17:43,392 --> 01:17:45,099
They're cute

1183
01:17:45,428 --> 01:17:46,805
We'd follow suite

1184
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:51,039
But we're too busy

1185
01:17:51,901 --> 01:17:55,610
To have a fiancé

1186
01:17:56,706 --> 01:18:00,313
We strut the catwalk daily

1187
01:18:00,476 --> 01:18:02,422
And time flies gaily

1188
01:18:02,578 --> 01:18:03,648
Flies past too fast

1189
01:18:03,813 --> 01:18:04,757
Too fast

1190
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:13,326
She's a lot more relaxed

1191
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:17,666
Than when we saw har around

1192
01:18:17,827 --> 01:18:19,363
But now

1193
01:18:20,396 --> 01:18:24,742
She's the prettiest lassie
From Normandy

1194
01:18:24,901 --> 01:18:26,642
In Paris town

1195
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:32,751
Fill a bottle change a nappy

1196
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:36,651
At the créche the kids are happy

1197
01:18:37,013 --> 01:18:41,325
But when they catch a nasty cold

1198
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:45,756
Home they come as good as gold

1199
01:18:47,523 --> 01:18:49,560
Bye bye ba by
Mum's 0ff to work

1200
01:18:51,394 --> 01:18:53,499
There's nowhere to sit

1201
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:55,539
There are beds for fornicating

1202
01:18:55,698 --> 01:18:57,644
It's no good for anyone

1203
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,610
To witness all this mating

1204
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:44,557
How oId was she
when we adopted her?

1205
01:19:44,713 --> 01:19:46,317
Let's say six months.

1206
01:19:49,385 --> 01:19:51,387
And why a black baby?

1207
01:19:51,554 --> 01:19:54,865
That's what life offered
and we were overjoyed.

1208
01:19:57,927 --> 01:20:00,100
And why did we adopt?

1209
01:20:01,063 --> 01:20:02,736
We were sterile.

1210
01:20:03,766 --> 01:20:05,302
You were sterile.

1211
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:06,674
Alright.

1212
01:20:07,703 --> 01:20:09,114
Can you manage?

1213
01:20:09,438 --> 01:20:11,850
What? It's all Greek to me.

1214
01:20:14,443 --> 01:20:15,751
I can't help you.

1215
01:20:23,052 --> 01:20:25,658
Dad, mum, this is Quentin.

1216
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,062
- Roland Cléry, good to meet you.
- Hello.

1217
01:20:28,391 --> 01:20:30,393
Mimi. I'm delighted.

1218
01:20:30,693 --> 01:20:31,763
Darling!

1219
01:20:32,428 --> 01:20:34,101
Hi, honey-bunch. Had a good trip?

1220
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:35,101
Excellent.

1221
01:20:35,431 --> 01:20:38,105
What's Before the Eure
you're cutting it fine?

1222
01:20:38,434 --> 01:20:40,345
That's the county council.

1223
01:20:40,503 --> 01:20:41,004
It's funny.

1224
01:20:41,971 --> 01:20:43,041
- You think so?
- Yes.

1225
01:20:43,372 --> 01:20:46,649
You don't find
the colour code meaningless?

1226
01:20:46,809 --> 01:20:47,981
Back off.

1227
01:20:48,144 --> 01:20:49,748
- Need a hand?
- It's fine.

1228
01:20:49,912 --> 01:20:51,414
Come on in.

1229
01:20:53,883 --> 01:20:55,760
Did you clean up the house?

1230
01:20:55,918 --> 01:20:57,727
Of course, don't worry.

1231
01:21:01,724 --> 01:21:03,635
Was that at school?

1232
01:21:09,732 --> 01:21:10,972
You were so cute.

1233
01:21:11,567 --> 01:21:12,545
Yeah?

1234
01:21:12,768 --> 01:21:13,940
Wasn't she!

1235
01:21:14,103 --> 01:21:16,083
I love school photos. Got any more?

1236
01:21:17,907 --> 01:21:18,749
Really?

1237
01:21:18,908 --> 01:21:20,080
The one and only.

1238
01:21:20,409 --> 01:21:21,717
How come?

1239
01:21:23,946 --> 01:21:26,950
This young lady was
the only black child in class.

1240
01:21:27,683 --> 01:21:31,096
So she systematically

1241
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:33,661
refused to be in the annual photo.

1242
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:38,536
We did our best to explain

1243
01:21:38,694 --> 01:21:41,300
that it was normal,
she'd been adopted.

1244
01:21:41,463 --> 01:21:42,965
But it was hopeless.

1245
01:21:43,132 --> 01:21:45,908
She's a stubborn little thing!

1246
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:47,547
Right, honey-bunch?

1247
01:21:48,137 --> 01:21:49,946
- Any more?
- Any more what?

1248
01:21:50,105 --> 01:21:51,948
- Photos of Agatha.
- Sure!

1249
01:21:52,108 --> 01:21:54,714
Birthdays, holidays, lots!

1250
01:21:55,478 --> 01:21:56,786
Can I see them?

1251
01:21:57,379 --> 01:21:58,357
No.

1252
01:21:59,715 --> 01:22:02,457
I'd love to show you them but...

1253
01:22:02,985 --> 01:22:04,931
They've all been tidied away.

1254
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:07,328
Dad's always been shambolic.

1255
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:10,060
Not exactly ideal for an ironmonger!

1256
01:22:10,392 --> 01:22:13,373
Luckily I have a very tidy wife.

1257
01:22:13,529 --> 01:22:15,566
They always say oppositas attract.

1258
01:22:15,731 --> 01:22:17,677
Come and see the house.

1259
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:35,317
Your parents are nice.

1260
01:22:35,484 --> 01:22:36,758
For white people.

1261
01:22:38,053 --> 01:22:39,896
Not a word against my parents.

1262
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:44,668
- Hello.
- Hello.

1263
01:22:45,594 --> 01:22:46,800
Hello, Thomas.

1264
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:48,669
- How old are you, Thomas?
-6.

1265
01:22:48,831 --> 01:22:51,471
6! I'm 0Id, I'm 33.

1266
01:22:51,634 --> 01:22:52,942
Were you white too?

1267
01:22:55,404 --> 01:22:56,610
Agathe was white before.

1268
01:22:57,106 --> 01:22:58,346
Really?

1269
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:01,913
Kids have such vivid imaginations!
What they think up!

1270
01:23:02,077 --> 01:23:03,112
Are you sick too?

1271
01:23:03,445 --> 01:23:04,355
No, I'm not sick.

1272
01:23:04,513 --> 01:23:05,457
Me neither.

1273
01:23:05,614 --> 01:23:06,854
So why are you black?

1274
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:09,696
Run along. We'ra having a rest.

1275
01:23:10,352 --> 01:23:12,628
- Why are you white?
- I was born white.

1276
01:23:12,788 --> 01:23:14,028
And I was born black.

1277
01:23:14,356 --> 01:23:16,597
But Agathe used to be white.

1278
01:23:16,759 --> 01:23:18,329
Agatha, you were white.

1279
01:23:19,461 --> 01:23:21,065
Who's been talking nonsense?

1280
01:23:21,397 --> 01:23:22,569
But I saw you!

1281
01:23:22,731 --> 01:23:23,937
- You didn't!
-I did!

1282
01:23:24,099 --> 01:23:24,702
ou didn't!

1283
01:23:24,867 --> 01:23:26,437
Camille!

1284
01:23:26,602 --> 01:23:28,673
OK, OK, I was white.

1285
01:23:28,838 --> 01:23:31,079
Why do you tell him
stuff like that?

1286
01:23:31,406 --> 01:23:32,817
Camille!

1287
01:23:32,975 --> 01:23:35,353
It's a game.
Go play with your sister.

1288
01:23:35,511 --> 01:23:38,458
Telling a kid we're black
because we're sick is not a game!

1289
01:23:38,614 --> 01:23:40,025
Camille!

1290
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:40,827
What?

1291
01:23:40,983 --> 01:23:42,826
Was Agathe white before?

1292
01:23:42,985 --> 01:23:45,864
Yes! She had an illness,
it turned her black!

1293
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:46,761
You see?

1294
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:48,699
No way!

1295
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:51,337
She's black with white parents,
but she's not sick.

1296
01:23:51,493 --> 01:23:53,632
- She is!
- No, really.

1297
01:23:54,329 --> 01:23:55,399
Know what adoption is?

1298
01:23:55,564 --> 01:23:58,477
Justine in my class was adopted,
she's Vietnamese.

1299
01:23:58,801 --> 01:24:00,337
- There!
- I'm the same.

1300
01:24:00,502 --> 01:24:03,381
No, dad said you had an illness.

1301
01:24:03,906 --> 01:24:04,976
OK then.

1302
01:24:05,141 --> 01:24:07,018
No, it's not OK!

1303
01:24:07,342 --> 01:24:08,047
Dad!

1304
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:09,913
Don't bother your father!

1305
01:24:10,078 --> 01:24:12,684
Ask him.
You'll see Agatha isn't sick.

1306
01:24:12,848 --> 01:24:14,418
Dad!

1307
01:24:14,583 --> 01:24:15,994
Don't shout! What is it?

1308
01:24:16,318 --> 01:24:18,059
Wasn't Agathe white before?

1309
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:22,534
No! We've told you umpteen times
she was adopted!

1310
01:24:24,626 --> 01:24:25,696
You see?

1311
01:24:35,804 --> 01:24:37,044
Thanks a lot.

1312
01:24:37,373 --> 01:24:38,443
No problem.

1313
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:54,329
The group leader CVs
that Agatha chose.

1314
01:25:03,665 --> 01:25:05,667
- What's going on?
- What?

1315
01:25:05,834 --> 01:25:06,972
What's this?

1316
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:10,743
OK, he's blond. So what?

1317
01:25:10,906 --> 01:25:12,408
He's white!

1318
01:25:12,574 --> 01:25:16,989
He has the best CV of the three.
That's the bottom line, right?

1319
01:25:17,313 --> 01:25:19,315
Are you taking the piss?

1320
01:25:19,681 --> 01:25:20,591
How do you mean?

1321
01:25:20,749 --> 01:25:23,059
We have a basic postulate here.

1322
01:25:23,385 --> 01:25:26,298
Only one : No Whites.

1323
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:27,957
I know. But it's stupid.

1324
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:30,763
As stupid as No Blacks or No Arabs.

1325
01:25:30,926 --> 01:25:32,564
Maybe. That's how it is.

1326
01:25:32,728 --> 01:25:35,572
Why not say no one under 6 foot?
Or no nudists?

1327
01:25:35,731 --> 01:25:37,836
No one who was born on Thursday?

1328
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,741
You know why
I started this company.

1329
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:43,008
Yes. You don't want whites.

1330
01:25:43,339 --> 01:25:43,840
Right.

1331
01:25:44,006 --> 01:25:46,077
You know what made me do it?

1332
01:25:46,408 --> 01:25:47,409
No.

1333
01:25:47,576 --> 01:25:48,987
A bitch told her HR director

1334
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:51,715
I wanted 500 euros more
than the other guy.

1335
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,382
Just because I was black.

1336
01:25:54,583 --> 01:25:55,960
Isn't that vile?

1337
01:25:57,619 --> 01:25:58,597
Yes.

1338
01:26:01,557 --> 01:26:02,467
Where was it?

1339
01:26:02,624 --> 01:26:03,659
At the Guinards'.

1340
01:26:04,393 --> 01:26:07,806
That day I swore I'd never
be dependent on white whims.

1341
01:26:07,963 --> 01:26:10,671
When that stuff stops
I'll think again.

1342
01:26:10,833 --> 01:26:14,906
But right now,
I want no whites in this company.

1343
01:26:15,537 --> 01:26:16,481
OK?

1344
01:26:18,707 --> 01:26:19,811
If you say so.

1345
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:25,957
You're bizarre!

1346
01:26:32,721 --> 01:26:34,723
Bizarre, you're bizarre
I'm not bizarre

1347
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:38,565
I'm up shit creek

1348
01:26:38,727 --> 01:26:39,535
You certainly are!

1349
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:43,040
Keep my mouth shut
And don't talk

1350
01:26:44,499 --> 01:26:47,969
Or speak and watch him
Take a walk

1351
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:50,811
You've cast the die

1352
01:26:50,973 --> 01:26:52,953
You've got to lie

1353
01:26:53,108 --> 01:26:54,712
If you own up

1354
01:26:54,877 --> 01:26:57,619
You'll screw it up

1355
01:26:57,779 --> 01:27:01,090
Why must it all
Fall apart?

1356
01:27:02,351 --> 01:27:04,524
Make me sad
And break my heart?

1357
01:27:04,686 --> 01:27:06,962
It was so beautiful
It was so fine

1358
01:27:07,122 --> 01:27:11,662
Say nothing
And keep Quentin

1359
01:27:11,827 --> 01:27:15,604
She's right say nothing

1360
01:27:15,764 --> 01:27:18,301
You'd regret it

1361
01:27:18,467 --> 01:27:20,469
You'd never forget it

1362
01:27:20,636 --> 01:27:22,513
True love

1363
01:27:22,938 --> 01:27:25,043
Is so precious

1364
01:27:25,374 --> 01:27:29,948
Just enjoy it
It's delicious

1365
01:27:32,014 --> 01:27:35,962
I don't want
To see him go

1366
01:27:36,118 --> 01:27:40,624
That's the way
So go with the flow

1367
01:27:40,856 --> 01:27:45,669
Okay, 0kay
I'll go with the flow

1368
01:27:45,827 --> 01:27:49,832
That's what I'm trying to say

1369
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:54,438
That's what she's trying to say

1370
01:27:54,903 --> 01:27:56,883
Trying to say

1371
01:27:57,039 --> 01:27:58,848
Trying to say

1372
01:27:59,575 --> 01:28:03,113
That's what she's trying to say

1373
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:17,763
Mmm, yes...

1374
01:28:19,661 --> 01:28:22,471
Yes, there, that's so good...

1375
01:28:23,999 --> 01:28:25,603
Go on, more!

1376
01:28:36,078 --> 01:28:37,386
Right, time to get up.

1377
01:28:37,546 --> 01:28:39,617
- Want the bathroom?
- After you.

1378
01:28:57,065 --> 01:28:58,100
Hey!

1379
01:29:00,068 --> 01:29:00,842
Yes?

1380
01:29:01,003 --> 01:29:02,539
I've been thinking...

1381
01:29:02,704 --> 01:29:05,048
I'll give you a key,
it's more practical.

1382
01:29:07,009 --> 01:29:10,923
There's no ulterior motive,
it's not an official demand...

1383
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:12,824
Agatha?

1384
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:19,963
Did you hear what I said?

1385
01:29:21,123 --> 01:29:22,932
Yes. It's more practical.

1386
01:29:24,659 --> 01:29:27,105
What's more practical?

1387
01:29:27,696 --> 01:29:29,539
I don't know.

1388
01:29:29,865 --> 01:29:31,469
Say it again?

1389
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:33,777
I want to give you my keys.

1390
01:29:34,636 --> 01:29:36,377
Sweetheart!

1391
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:40,351
Completely out of it!

1392
01:29:49,417 --> 01:29:51,021
Increased your cortisone?

1393
01:29:51,753 --> 01:29:52,697
No.

1394
01:30:01,630 --> 01:30:03,541
Started another treatment?

1395
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:09,315
- What is it?
- I don't know.

1396
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:11,809
I don't know.

1397
01:30:11,974 --> 01:30:14,750
But if your ACTH level
keeps falling...

1398
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:15,650
Well?

1399
01:30:15,811 --> 01:30:17,586
You won't need any medication.

1400
01:30:19,448 --> 01:30:22,292
But I thought it was incurable!

1401
01:30:22,451 --> 01:30:24,556
Apparently not.

1402
01:30:26,321 --> 01:30:27,391
I'll be cured?

1403
01:30:28,023 --> 01:30:29,400
It looks like it.

1404
01:30:33,562 --> 01:30:34,973
I'll be white again?

1405
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:39,776
I don't want to be.

1406
01:30:39,935 --> 01:30:41,437
My job is never boring.

1407
01:30:41,603 --> 01:30:43,810
- I've built myself a new life.
- I see.

1408
01:30:43,972 --> 01:30:47,920
But it's rare to hear someone
complaining about being cured.

1409
01:30:48,076 --> 01:30:49,020
I don't want this.

1410
01:30:49,611 --> 01:30:51,318
I don't want to be white again!

1411
01:30:51,746 --> 01:30:53,020
I can't be!

1412
01:30:55,016 --> 01:30:56,654
Inoculate me with the virus?

1413
01:30:56,818 --> 01:30:58,957
Miss Cléry, it isn't a virus.

1414
01:30:59,121 --> 01:31:01,294
You know what I mean!

1415
01:31:05,127 --> 01:31:06,606
I'll be white again?

1416
01:31:08,396 --> 01:31:09,898
It's inevitable.

1417
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:42,001
Agatha?

1418
01:31:48,570 --> 01:31:49,674
Darling!

1419
01:31:55,810 --> 01:31:57,050
Have you seen Agatha?

1420
01:31:57,379 --> 01:31:58,323
No.

1421
01:31:58,847 --> 01:32:00,827
She called to say she's sick.

1422
01:32:00,982 --> 01:32:01,722
With what?

1423
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:03,727
I don't know.

1424
01:32:04,819 --> 01:32:05,661
Don't you know?

1425
01:32:06,455 --> 01:32:07,297
No.

1426
01:32:07,689 --> 01:32:09,566
- Haven't you seen her?
- Sure.

1427
01:32:11,326 --> 01:32:13,533
You had a row.

1428
01:32:18,466 --> 01:32:19,570
They had a row.

1429
01:32:20,969 --> 01:32:22,573
Agatha, it's Quentin.

1430
01:32:22,737 --> 01:32:25,343
I woke up without you.
Kader says you're sick.

1431
01:32:25,507 --> 01:32:26,713
I don't understand.

1432
01:32:27,342 --> 01:32:29,015
Call me,
tell me what's going on.

1433
01:32:29,778 --> 01:32:30,779
Lots of love.

1434
01:32:56,838 --> 01:33:00,445
Agatha, it's Quentin.
Explain why you won't talk to ma.

1435
01:33:00,609 --> 01:33:01,849
Call me, I love you.

1436
01:33:02,010 --> 01:33:02,852
Shit!

1437
01:33:03,011 --> 01:33:03,921
Lots of love.

1438
01:33:12,454 --> 01:33:14,991
Phoning at the wheel
is illegal in France.

1439
01:33:15,557 --> 01:33:16,797
Your ID.

1440
01:33:18,526 --> 01:33:20,506
This classy car yours?

1441
01:33:20,662 --> 01:33:23,643
Driving license,
insurance and registration,

1442
01:33:23,798 --> 01:33:24,936
please.

1443
01:33:30,071 --> 01:33:32,051
She doesn't want any lunch?

1444
01:33:33,375 --> 01:33:34,115
No.

1445
01:33:37,078 --> 01:33:39,456
Agatha, it's me again.

1446
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:41,821
I don't know what I did
to make you vanish.

1447
01:33:41,983 --> 01:33:43,018
But it's pathetic,

1448
01:33:43,351 --> 01:33:44,728
it pisses me off!

1449
01:33:47,088 --> 01:33:49,932
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1450
01:33:50,692 --> 01:33:52,535
If you think I'm moving too fast

1451
01:33:52,694 --> 01:33:54,935
I'll take my keys back, no problem.

1452
01:33:55,096 --> 01:33:59,010
But I won't hire someone white.
That's definite.

1453
01:34:00,068 --> 01:34:01,376
But whatever it is,

1454
01:34:01,536 --> 01:34:03,538
please call me!

1455
01:34:08,043 --> 01:34:10,114
Agatha, it's me again.

1456
01:34:13,882 --> 01:34:15,555
Don't want your orange juice?

1457
01:34:15,717 --> 01:34:16,593
No.

1458
01:34:24,125 --> 01:34:26,002
I'm taking your car, dad.

1459
01:34:37,038 --> 01:34:38,312
Dad!

1460
01:34:43,478 --> 01:34:44,582
Hi, girls.

1461
01:34:45,046 --> 01:34:46,582
What happened to you?

1462
01:35:01,696 --> 01:35:03,039
I'll call you back.

1463
01:35:03,731 --> 01:35:04,903
Agatha?

1464
01:35:06,434 --> 01:35:08,345
You hired someone white.

1465
01:35:08,503 --> 01:35:09,504
And slept with her.

1466
01:35:10,905 --> 01:35:12,009
No, but you're...

1467
01:35:13,808 --> 01:35:14,809
I'm white, Quentin.

1468
01:35:14,976 --> 01:35:16,751
I was born white.

1469
01:35:16,878 --> 01:35:18,983
I turned black because I was ill.

1470
01:35:19,581 --> 01:35:20,457
Now I'm cured.

1471
01:35:23,418 --> 01:35:24,522
No, it's...

1472
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,329
- It's not possible.
- It is.

1473
01:35:27,489 --> 01:35:30,333
And the white bitch
at the Guinards'...

1474
01:35:30,492 --> 01:35:31,596
Was me!

1475
01:35:37,399 --> 01:35:38,343
No, it's...

1476
01:35:42,103 --> 01:35:45,346
I love you, Quentin.
Black or white, I love you.

1477
01:35:48,810 --> 01:35:50,380
You can't deal with it?

1478
01:35:54,449 --> 01:35:56,520
No whites in this company, ever?

1479
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:06,774
It's so sad.

1480
01:39:09,077 --> 01:39:10,920
You both seemed so happy.

1481
01:39:13,614 --> 01:39:15,787
- No news?
- No.

1482
01:39:15,950 --> 01:39:17,452
Call him.

1483
01:39:17,819 --> 01:39:19,025
What's the point?

1484
01:39:19,654 --> 01:39:21,656
If he doesn't change his mind

1485
01:39:21,823 --> 01:39:24,360
good riddance, he's just a dickhead.

1486
01:39:27,995 --> 01:39:29,372
What are you going to do?

1487
01:39:29,531 --> 01:39:30,669
I don't know.

1488
01:39:30,832 --> 01:39:32,470
Look for a job.

1489
01:39:32,634 --> 01:39:34,875
And deal with a couple of things.

1490
01:39:43,845 --> 01:39:44,846
Miss Cléry?

1491
01:39:46,047 --> 01:39:48,926
Mr Thiédot, my lawyer.
Joélle Segbent, my best friend.

1492
01:39:49,083 --> 01:39:50,562
- Sorry!
- No, my fault.

1493
01:39:50,718 --> 01:39:52,527
- Miss...
- Hello!

1494
01:40:02,497 --> 01:40:05,478
I'd like your advice
on Agathe's replacement.

1495
01:40:26,621 --> 01:40:27,895
Good morning.

1496
01:40:28,456 --> 01:40:31,369
I have an appointment with
Mr Guinard, Guinard & Guinard.

1497
01:40:31,526 --> 01:40:33,563
- Who shall I say?
- Mr Thiénot.

1498
01:40:33,728 --> 01:40:37,767
In accordance with article 225-2
of the penal code,

1499
01:40:37,932 --> 01:40:40,674
and article L122-144

1500
01:40:40,835 --> 01:40:42,337
of the code of ethics,

1501
01:40:42,503 --> 01:40:45,347
my client files a complaint
for unjustified dismissal

1502
01:40:45,506 --> 01:40:46,746
and racial discrimination.

1503
01:40:47,709 --> 01:40:51,452
Kindly inform me of the name
of your defending lawyer.

1504
01:40:51,613 --> 01:40:52,614
Good day.

1505
01:40:57,585 --> 01:40:59,326
What do we do, dad?

1506
01:40:59,487 --> 01:41:01,023
We're in deep shit.

1507
01:41:01,923 --> 01:41:03,527
Attagirl, Agatha!

1508
01:41:09,764 --> 01:41:10,799
Hiya!

1509
01:41:10,965 --> 01:41:12,069
Is Hervé in?

1510
01:41:12,667 --> 01:41:13,702
Hervé!

1511
01:41:25,513 --> 01:41:27,424
What are you doing?

1512
01:41:27,581 --> 01:41:28,821
I'm back!

1513
01:41:29,884 --> 01:41:33,093
We said wa'd gat back togathar
as soon as I was white.

1514
01:41:33,421 --> 01:41:34,559
I am now!

1515
01:41:34,722 --> 01:41:36,497
So we're together.

1516
01:41:38,726 --> 01:41:41,002
I missed you, Herve darling.

1517
01:41:43,765 --> 01:41:44,869
Didn't he tell you?

1518
01:41:45,033 --> 01:41:45,875
No.

1519
01:41:46,734 --> 01:41:48,008
Naughty boy!

1520
01:41:48,336 --> 01:41:51,943
That's not nice,
you should have told her.

1521
01:41:54,342 --> 01:41:57,983
Don't worry about picking up
your stuff. No rush.

1522
01:42:03,584 --> 01:42:05,359
So long, asshole.

1523
01:42:56,003 --> 01:42:58,449
White wanted
to work in coloured company

1524
01:42:58,606 --> 01:43:01,348
and love the boss
who can't live without her.

1525
01:43:05,380 --> 01:43:06,017
Well done!

1526
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:07,920
Out of the way!

1527
