00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:48,837
Do you sing anything other than that
kind of country and western shite?

179
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,881
Sorry, what's wrong with
country and western, mate'?

180
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,798
OK.

181
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:57,011
Alright, folks.
We got a winner for youse.

182
00:13:57,125 --> 00:14:00,129
Taking home the 10 bucks -
you won it, bud...

183
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,594
it's Noelene, with 'Morningtown
Ride'.

184
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,710
- But I was great!
- We were the best.

185
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,677
That's bullshit, Merle.
That's a sack of dick.

186
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:09,715
You're giving it to Noelene'?

187
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,050
She's allergic to music.

188
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:12,794
That's a fix.

189
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:18,299

00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:24,339
You were marvellous.

Did you forget something'?

193
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,301
Thanks.

194
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:34,216
And we can get ourselves thrown out
of a pub. Don't need your help.

to get off my premises.

sing in your crappy contest.

- What's the story anyhow?</i>

- She's ugly enough.

199
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:47,637
- (LAUGHS)
- And you can piss off out of it too.

200
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,218
You were a shithouse MC anyhow!

201

Better than you deserve.
And a lot better than you pay.

202
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:53,760
Oh, I can find somebody else.

203
00:14:55,917 --> 00:14:59,000
Alright, let's not do anything hasty.

Come on. Remember'?

210
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:18,420

you've caused me enough trouble today.

how to read, goat-face.

217
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,002
- Then why are you showing me that?
- You need a job, don't you?

218
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,547
We're offering you one.

219
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:40,669

220
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:42,510
Yeah, OK. Where's Vietnam'?

221
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,798
Hey, Julie, the only place
you're going is home on the bus.

222
00:15:44,917 --> 00:15:46,715
You want to go perform in Vietnam'?

you're the only
Aboriginal girl group I've ever seen.

227
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,505

Vietnam? It's not for you.

Who are you to say
what we can and can't do'?

let's say that you do go to Vietnam.

What would you sing?

242
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:41,421
Because this may have escaped
your notice, but you're black.

243
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,466
And you're singing
country and western music.

244
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,005
It's just wrong.

245
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,674
Well, what do you think
we should sing?

246
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,708
90% of all recorded music is shite.

247
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:57,042
The other 10% is soul.

248
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,335
Soul music.

00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,667

- We like Charley Pride.

They're having some problems
over there at the minute,

be miles away from any of the fighting.

- Not any more.
- Julie's right.

I have managed to secure the girls
an audition in Melbourne.

You know, we small talk 'cause

"Hey, I've got a group."

309

"Bring them down, Dave.
We want to see 'em."

325
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,879
Being treated like dogs by the gubs
in town every single day.

326
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,593
That's not the life I was born for.

- We can stay at Uncle Ed's.

- You've got a child.

342
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,506
And you're no more
than a child yourself.

343
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:17,253

00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:20,635

527
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,004
I sing lead.
Julie and the girls do back-ups.

528
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,423
How do you feel about not singing lead?

529
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:33,591
How do you feel about
getting knocked out by a woman'?

530
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:36,632
Pretty embarrassed, I would imagine.

531
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:40,880
The thing is, Gail, I pick the songs
and I pick who sings them.

532
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,925
Nobody tells me or my sisters
what to sing or who sings lead.

533
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,093
Your voice isn't good enough
to sing lead.

534
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:52,551
You want to say that again?

535
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:54,965
Not really. No.

536
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:59,962
Gail, you are a commanding presence,

537
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:03,292
on stage as you are in life.

538
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:07,342
But you also have the weakest voice
out of the four of you.

539
00:31:09,875 --> 00:31:11,218
He's right, Gail.

540
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:15,132
You can hold a tune but
you can't hold your own in a solo.

541
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:17,760
Sometimes.

542
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:19,548
More than sometimes.

543
00:31:20,542 --> 00:31:23,671
Anyone else'? Cynthia?

544
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:27,092
Maybe you should just let
those of us who can do it, do it.

545
00:31:34,167 --> 00:31:35,919
Yeah, OK, then.

546
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:39,757

Before we go again...

550
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:52,011
girls, when I met you,

551
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:54,298
you were doing your whole
country and western thing

552
00:31:54,417 --> 00:31:56,135
and that's fine - we all make
mistakes.

553
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:59,459
But here's where we learn
from that mistake.

554
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:03,338
Country and western music is
about loss.

555
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:06,302
Soul music is also about loss.

556
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:09,170
But the difference is,
in country and western music,

557
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:13,422
they've lost, they've given up and they're
just at home whining about it.

558
00:32:13,542 --> 00:32:15,169
In soul music,

559
00:32:15,292 --> 00:32:16,760
they're struggling to get it back

560
00:32:16,875 --> 00:32:18,343
and they haven't given up,

561
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:20,881
so every note
that passes through your lips

562
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,549
should have the tone of a woman
who's grasping and fighting

563
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:26,295
and desperate to retrieve
what's been taken from her.

564
00:32:26,417 --> 00:32:28,260
You understand?

565
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:31,675
Now, what it is that you're
searching for, that's up to you.

566
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:37,337
I'm just here to get you there,
you know?

Myron Ritchie. Your promoter.

704
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:35,802
Welcome, Sapphires.
Welcome to Saigon.

705
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:39,376
I'm trusting you'll regard the La Parisian
as your home away from home

706
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,797
all the while you're here in Vietnam.

707
00:40:40,917 --> 00:40:42,339
Is this where we're staying?

708
00:40:42,458 --> 00:40:44,426
Nothing but the best for our stars,
baby.

709
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:48,718
OK, uh, Myron, um,
are you the man we talk to about money

710
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:52,133
because, um, if we don't get
the bucks, these stars don't shine.

711
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,627
- Gail.
- Hey!

712
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:56,503
Myron. Dave Lovelace.

713
00:40:56,625 --> 00:40:58,878
Great to meet you.
I'm the manager of the Sapphires.

714
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,174
These girls are ball-busting good.
Man, this is going to be great.

715
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:04,090
Food and accommodation
have all been taken care of, ma'am.

716
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:06,802
And I think you'll find you gals
won't need much cash on the road.

717
00:41:06,917 --> 00:41:10,876
But in the meantime, why don't you
girls check in - have a look around

718
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,584
while I talk turkey with Ringo Starr
and big sister here.

719
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:16,005
Plenty to see.

- Ladies.
- Plenty.

721
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,718
It goes without saying,

722
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:25,961
reports on the Sapphires
have been excellent.

723
00:41:27,292 --> 00:41:28,839
And I've got to tell you,
I'm really looking forward

724
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:32,007
to seeing you sweethearts showcase
your talent on stage tonight.

725
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:33,422
Tonight?

726
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:34,919
Well, listen up, honey.

727
00:41:35,042 --> 00:41:36,919
I got 32 acts.

728
00:41:37,042 --> 00:41:38,635
Five of them are soul sisters.

729
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:41,424
If you can't shake your money maker
for the brothers tonight,

730
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:44,011
you're all on the first plane
back to Austria tomorrow.

731
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:45,468

732
00:41:45,583 --> 00:41:46,960
The first plane.

733
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:49,552
Fear not, brother Myron.

734
00:41:49,667 --> 00:41:52,386
I know my girls can lay it down.

735
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:57,379
And, sister, the singing -
it ain't the half of it.

736
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,925
The show - it better be right on.

737
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:06,299
If the pool's gonna be on the roof,
it's gonna be up this way.

738
00:42:06,417 --> 00:42:08,966
Are you sure we're allowed up here?
Isn't it just for the soldiers?

739
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:10,300
Yes, Julie.

740
00:42:10,417 --> 00:42:13,216
I can smell where the good-looking
men are from a mile away.

741
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:15,176
You're over Jimmy Middleton now'?

742
00:42:15,292 --> 00:42:18,136
Don't mention his name.
He's had his go.

743
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:21,049
He's not getting a second serve
of this coffee-coloured Koori.

744
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:26,967
He's in Cummeragunja, I'm in Saigon.
I can do what I like.

Sorry.

750
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:57,252
We're looking for the pool.

751
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,753
You'll find the pool thataways.

752
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,468
OK.

753
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:06,176

Can I have a word?

757
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:46,961
Ah, yeah,
we're going to need to smarten up.

758
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:55,257
I've never seen
so many black men in the one place.

759

you tighten up the act out of town.

You're four black women in
a war zone, honey.

846

Now, all you need to do is sing.

Myron, we don't pass wind
without a military escort.

Come on, Dave.

out on the road

850

without the might of the US military
to protect them?

What about a band?

You've been singing with them
right there, sister.

00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,173

- Looks like you're in trouble, man.

1051
00:57:43,292 --> 00:57:44,464
Hey, Gail.

1052
00:57:44,583 --> 00:57:45,960

You're on your last warning.

1057
00:57:54,542 --> 00:57:58,001
You're on your last warning.
How about that?

1058
00:57:58,125 --> 00:58:00,844
I came here to apologise
for giving you a hard time

1059
00:58:00,958 --> 00:58:02,756
but now I'm not gonna bother.

1060
00:58:05,083 --> 00:58:06,710

She has no shame, eh'?

Oh, honestly, Gail.

Don't stress

01:00:00,792 --> 01:00:03,045
Oh, well. You never know.

1085
01:00:03,167 --> 01:00:05,716
You think you can walk away
from your mob'?

1086
01:00:07,167 --> 01:00:09,511
Live in the city for 10 years
making out you're a gubba

1087
01:00:09,625 --> 01:00:13,175
and then get up on stage and say
you're a black fella and that's alright?

1088
01:00:14,583 --> 01:00:17,177
Nah. It's not alright, not with me.

1089
01:00:18,167 --> 01:00:20,795
Don't start me, Gail.
I'm not going to do this now.

1090
01:00:20,917 --> 01:00:24,217
Oh, this poor little mission gin
is making the coconut shame, eh'?

1091
01:00:25,208 --> 01:00:26,551
What did you call me?

1092
01:00:26,667 --> 01:00:27,714
Coconut?

1093
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:29,801
Oh, sorry. Have I offended ya'?

1094
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:33,217
Don't go telling me what I am
and what I'm not.

1095
01:00:33,333 --> 01:00:36,007
I didn't get a say
in how things worked out for me.

1096
01:00:37,542 --> 01:00:41,046
So you're black now, or you're
white?

1097
01:00:42,042 --> 01:00:43,715
You're black
now you think there's money in it.

1098
01:00:43,833 --> 01:00:45,130
I know what I am.

1099
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:47,548
Yeah, but does Robby?

1100
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:20,797
DAVE: Gail?

1101
01:01:21,917 --> 01:01:23,294
Gail?

1102
01:01:28,125 --> 01:01:30,503
What was that about?

1103
01:01:35,583 --> 01:01:36,755
Kay's mum.

1104
01:01:37,917 --> 01:01:39,260
It's her birthday.

1105
01:01:40,833 --> 01:01:42,551
So we're doing a show for her...

1106
01:01:45,125 --> 01:01:46,798
and we're on top of a truck.

1107
01:01:51,792 --> 01:01:55,922
Two black cars pull in.
Government fellas.

1108
01:01:57,208 --> 01:02:00,007
<i>- Run!
- ( SCREAMING)</i>

1109
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:01,342
GO, go!

1110
01:02:01,458 --> 01:02:03,927
- Come on! Now!
- Get the kids away!

1111
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,094
Mum and Dad screaming at us.

1112
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:10,677
"Kids, get across the river!“"

1113
01:02:11,958 --> 01:02:14,302
I don't get it. What did they want'?

1114
01:02:14,417 --> 01:02:16,294
The children.

1115
01:02:17,417 --> 01:02:20,751
It's my responsibility, Dave,
to look after the little ones

1116
01:02:20,875 --> 01:02:22,218
because I'm the oldest.

1117
01:02:22,333 --> 01:02:23,710
Hurry UP!

1118
01:02:23,833 --> 01:02:26,677
I'm not to let them out of my sight,
especially not Kay.

1119
01:02:26,792 --> 01:02:28,009
Why Kay'?

1120
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,798
If you're fair like Kay,

1121
01:02:30,917 --> 01:02:33,386
them fellas reckon
she could pass for white.

1122
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,797
- Get out of the way!
- Leave them kids alone!

1123
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,419
Take her from her family,

1124
01:02:36,542 --> 01:02:38,965
put her in an institution,
teach her white ways.

1125
01:02:40,125 --> 01:02:42,344
Pretty soon, there'll be no
black fellas left to worry about.

1126
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:44,256
- (COUGHS)
- Kay.

1127
01:02:44,375 --> 01:02:46,969
And then, um, Kay got sick.

1128
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:49,797
I mean real sick.

1129
01:02:51,625 --> 01:02:56,131
We're scared it's pneumonia
so we take her to town, to hospital...

1130
01:02:58,583 --> 01:03:03,293
and... and that's when we find out
them government fellas have been back.

1131
01:03:03,417 --> 01:03:04,760
Where's Kay'?

1132
01:03:04,875 --> 01:03:07,094
They've taken Kay from the hospital bed.

1133
01:03:07,208 --> 01:03:10,052
You've got to speak to me!
Say something to me!

1134
01:03:10,167 --> 01:03:12,010
Where's my baby little girl?

1135
01:03:12,125 --> 01:03:14,924
Where's Kay gone? Kay!

1136
01:03:15,042 --> 01:03:17,761
Where are you, baby girl?

1137
01:03:18,958 --> 01:03:20,835
- Speak to me!
- GAIL: "Kay."

1138
01:03:20,958 --> 01:03:22,505
Say something to me!

1139
01:03:22,625 --> 01:03:23,626
GAIL: "Where are you, Kay?"

1140
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:25,377
No, I won't stop!

1141
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:26,877
GAIL: "Where's my girl?"

1142
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,718
Where's Kay gone?!

1143
01:03:30,458 --> 01:03:33,132
You know, we didn't see Kay
till her mum died.

1144
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:35,548
They let her come home for the
funeral.

1145
01:03:36,917 --> 01:03:38,385
And all she could say
in all that time...

1146
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,753
If you people worked
as much as you fished,

1147
01:03:40,875 --> 01:03:43,219
you'd be really rich, you know?

1148
01:03:43,333 --> 01:03:47,588
And I've never been able to forgive
her, or myself.

1149
01:03:58,625 --> 01:04:00,343
We should dance.

1150
01:04:01,917 --> 01:04:03,419
What?

1151
01:04:05,042 --> 01:04:06,760
It's a good time to dance.

1152
01:04:06,875 --> 01:04:08,798
Uh, nuh.

1153
01:04:08,917 --> 01:04:10,169
Come on.

1154
01:04:10,292 --> 01:04:11,509
I'll show you how to
shake your moom.

1155
01:04:12,667 --> 01:04:14,465
Yeah-no, I've seen you shake your
moom. It's not pretty.

1156
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:15,459
(CHUCKLES)

1157
01:04:15,583 --> 01:04:19,087
I'm gonna teach you
the Lovelace Lanky Leg Shuffle.

1158
01:04:19,208 --> 01:04:20,255
No.

1159
01:04:20,375 --> 01:04:21,592
If I start dancing like you,

1160
01:04:21,708 --> 01:04:23,426
the brothers there
might think I'm a gubba.

1161
01:04:23,542 --> 01:04:26,091
Oh, I see. You're saying because
I'm white, I can't dance. Is that it'?

1162
01:04:26,208 --> 01:04:28,836
- Yep.
- Well, that's just racist.

1163
01:04:28,958 --> 01:04:30,585
You're a racist.

1164
01:04:30,708 --> 01:04:32,176
You should know better.

1165
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:35,468
Come on.

1166
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:38,752
Just watch and learn.
Don't be afraid.

1167
01:04:40,417 --> 01:04:41,885
It's all about the shoulders.

1168
01:04:42,875 --> 01:04:47,005
They don't belong to me,
they belong to the music in my head.

1169
01:04:48,625 --> 01:04:50,127
(BOTH LAUGH)

1170
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:51,672
<i>- Nuh.
- Deadly.</i>

1171
01:04:51,792 --> 01:04:55,672
When we use that word, 'deadly',
it usually means something's good.

1172
01:04:55,792 --> 01:04:57,044
Ooh.

1173
01:05:03,125 --> 01:05:04,968
You know, Gail,
there's a funny thing about you.

1174
01:05:05,083 --> 01:05:07,381
Everybody thinks
that you're just this...

1175
01:05:08,542 --> 01:05:10,920
this mouth on legs...

1176
01:05:11,042 --> 01:05:14,751
this defensive,
argumentative old witch.

1177
01:05:14,875 --> 01:05:16,468
Stick with me.

1178
01:05:16,583 --> 01:05:21,419
There's a reason
that you're this... terrible mouth,

1179
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:23,920
and it's very simple.

1180
01:05:27,042 --> 01:05:28,589
You're mama bear...

1181
01:05:30,667 --> 01:05:32,510
and they're your little baby cubs.

1182
01:05:40,833 --> 01:05:43,302
- You been drinking?

1183
01:05:43,417 --> 01:05:45,010
No.

1184
01:05:47,708 --> 01:05:48,925
Oh.

1185
01:05:49,042 --> 01:05:51,386
Come on, then,
you silver-tongued wannabe.

1186
01:05:52,958 --> 01:05:54,210
I'll dance with ya.

1187
01:05:59,542 --> 01:06:01,089
Let me lead.

1188
01:06:01,208 --> 01:06:02,926
