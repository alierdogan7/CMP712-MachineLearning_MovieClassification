00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:17,869
we're going to book the best theater

00:08:19,473 --> 00:08:20,872
The St. James.

184
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:23,675
Oh, the St. James
would be so amazing.

185

- Long runs.

188
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:29,981
- Good juju.
- Yeah, okay, great, um...

189
00:08:29,983 --> 00:08:32,067
What if we don't get
a theater today, hmm?

190
00:08:32,069 --> 00:08:33,852
I've got a lot of projects
waiting to hear

191
00:08:33,854 --> 00:08:35,687
how busy I'm gonna be...
I want to know what to plan for.

192
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:38,323
Don't worry about it, Derek.
I'll get it.

193
00:08:38,325 --> 00:08:40,659
Meanwhile, keep our leading lady happy.

194

Everyone's talking about her.

195

They want to know if she's
as good as they've heard.

196
00:08:44,164 --> 00:08:45,730
Oh, she's better.

197

Yes, we all know
where you stand on the matter.

198
00:08:48,202 --> 00:08:50,418
Oh, and it's not just me.

199
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,403
Or didn't you read the reviews either?

Thank you, Ana, for letting me move in

215
00:09:23,203 --> 00:09:24,619

Where are you going tonight,
by the way?

217
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:28,773
Derek is taking me
to see Veronica Moore

218
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:30,275
and then meet her after.

219
00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:32,210
Oh, you get to meet her?
I'm so jealous.

220
00:09:32,212 --> 00:09:35,547
She's incredible.
You're gonna love the show too.

221
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:39,134
It's about this, like, sweet,
1950s aretha/etta James type,

222
00:09:39,136 --> 00:09:40,552
but she has
this really overbearing mother.

223
00:09:40,554 --> 00:09:42,470
- Well, don't spoil it.
- Here.

224
00:09:42,472 --> 00:09:46,308
- How do I look?
- Like you care.

225
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:49,127
Maybe I do.

227

So what'd your agent say?

228
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:55,734
When I told him that
he should expect a phone call

229
00:09:55,736 --> 00:09:57,802
about my contract,
he said that the agency

230
00:09:57,804 --> 00:10:00,822
had already received phone calls
for their other clients.

231
00:10:00,824 --> 00:10:02,640

238

to stay with the show.

Any suggestions?

240
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:22,660
Well, you're an amazing singer,

241
00:10:22,662 --> 00:10:24,346
an even better actress.

exactly where you are?

Protect the work.

00:14:56,203 --> 00:14:59,120
Yes, mine...
The ones you stole.

354
00:14:59,122 --> 00:15:00,722
If only you would stop,

355
00:15:00,724 --> 00:15:02,907
stop thinking the worst of me.

356
00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:05,910
I know you,
and I know what you're up to.

357
00:15:05,912 --> 00:15:07,629
You saw my show, and you saw

358
00:15:07,631 --> 00:15:09,547
it was better than anything you have.

359
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:11,716
So you called all the theater owners

360
00:15:11,718 --> 00:15:13,401
to block my way,

361
00:15:13,403 --> 00:15:17,255
hoping that I would come to you
in my time of need.

362
00:15:17,257 --> 00:15:19,307
If you want in, you should just say so.

363
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:21,459
I want in.

364
00:15:21,461 --> 00:15:22,960
Get out of here

365
00:15:22,962 --> 00:15:24,812
before I throw another drink
in your face.

366
00:15:24,814 --> 00:15:26,564
[Laughs]

367
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:27,932
Eileen, I'm so sorry I'm late.

368
00:15:27,934 --> 00:15:30,602
Jordan. Nonsense.

369
00:15:30,604 --> 00:15:32,820
You already called.
Does he know?

370
00:15:32,822 --> 00:15:34,989
No.
Should we tell him?

371
00:15:34,991 --> 00:15:37,408
I have offered
<i>Bombshell</i> to the St. James.

372
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,826
Isn't that wonderful?

373
00:15:38,828 --> 00:15:40,478
[Cell phone ringing]

374
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,448
Oh.
It's Nick, my boyfriend.

375
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,116
Excuse me.

376
00:15:45,118 --> 00:15:47,151
Hi.
Guess what.

377
00:15:47,153 --> 00:15:48,819
I hope you're sitting down.

378
00:15:48,821 --> 00:15:50,922
We're going to Broadway.

379
00:15:50,924 --> 00:15:53,958
- Excuse me.
- Mm.

380
00:16:16,456 --> 00:16:19,585
♪ let me be your star

381
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:22,710
All:
♪ let me be your star

382
00:16:22,712 --> 00:16:26,347
♪ let me be your star

383
00:16:26,349 --> 00:16:28,349
[vocalizing]

384
00:16:28,351 --> 00:16:30,551
[Claps] And then people will clap,

385
00:16:30,553 --> 00:16:33,054
Eileen will speak,
and the other number will start.

386
00:16:33,056 --> 00:16:34,389
Uh, another?

387
00:16:34,391 --> 00:16:36,190
Eileen only asked me to do one.

388
00:16:36,192 --> 00:16:38,059
Oh, it's not you.
It's Ivy and the ensemble.

389
00:16:38,061 --> 00:16:39,861
They're going to sing <i>Smash.</i>

390
00:16:39,863 --> 00:16:42,897
Linda, can we do something
about the angle of this piano?

391
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:44,399
I feel like I can't see anyone.

392
00:16:44,401 --> 00:16:48,703
Well, sure.
What if we...

393
00:16:48,705 --> 00:16:50,371
I know you won't believe me,

394
00:16:50,373 --> 00:16:52,206
but this isn't about you.

395
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:55,126
No, it's about you, as usual.

396
00:16:55,128 --> 00:16:57,745
Excuse me.

397
00:16:57,747 --> 00:17:00,781
Seems like old times.

398
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,455
Can I ask you a question?

399
00:17:12,144 --> 00:17:14,562
Go ahead.

400
00:17:14,564 --> 00:17:18,799
What is my future
with this show exactly?

401
00:17:18,801 --> 00:17:20,935
I want to do everything I can

402
00:17:20,937 --> 00:17:22,637
to ensure that
when it opens on Broadway

403
00:17:22,639 --> 00:17:24,155
that I'm a part of it.

404
00:17:24,157 --> 00:17:26,073
And my agent still hasn't gotten
a phone call...

405
00:17:26,075 --> 00:17:30,144
That's why you asked to sing.

406
00:17:30,146 --> 00:17:32,780
Okay, here's my answer.
It's not gonna be easy.

407
00:17:32,782 --> 00:17:35,983
You need to apologize to Karen

408
00:17:35,985 --> 00:17:38,486
for whatever it is that went on
between you two.

409
00:17:38,488 --> 00:17:40,655
I already did, in Boston.

410
00:17:40,657 --> 00:17:42,340
[Chuckles]

411
00:17:42,342 --> 00:17:46,093
Well, maybe you were apologizing
for the wrong thing.

412
00:17:46,095 --> 00:17:49,597
[Clears throat]
After the whole Michael...

413
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:50,998
Well, you know...

414
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,800
Um...

415
00:17:52,802 --> 00:17:55,269
I spent a lot of time
telling my husband

416
00:17:55,271 --> 00:17:59,106
I was sorry for what I did.

417
00:17:59,108 --> 00:18:02,510
But it meant nothing until I apologized

418
00:18:02,512 --> 00:18:04,779
for why I did it.

419
00:18:04,781 --> 00:18:06,814
If you could stop making this
about what happened

420
00:18:06,816 --> 00:18:09,650
and tell her why it did,

421
00:18:09,652 --> 00:18:12,787
you might just get a second chance.

422
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:15,439
Ivy, you're up.

423
00:18:15,441 --> 00:18:17,825
Good luck.

424
00:18:17,827 --> 00:18:20,111
I'm rooting for you.

425
00:18:20,113 --> 00:18:22,363
So, Derek,
another big moment for you...

426
00:18:22,365 --> 00:18:23,664
<i>Bombshell</i> and <i>The Wiz</i>

427
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,199
treading the boards the same season.

428
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:26,701
Mm hmm.

429
00:18:26,703 --> 00:18:28,052
Did you see the show in Boston?

430
00:18:28,054 --> 00:18:29,554
Not only did I see it,

431
00:18:29,556 --> 00:18:31,472
I saw it with Rebecca Duvall.

432
00:18:31,474 --> 00:18:33,374
I don't suppose you have
anything to say

433
00:18:33,376 --> 00:18:37,328
about her abrupt exit from the show?

434
00:18:39,982 --> 00:18:42,600
No comment.
Really?

435
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:45,970
Ah.

436
00:18:45,972 --> 00:18:47,555
Okay.

437
00:18:47,557 --> 00:18:51,375
Okay, Rebecca Duvall is a superstar.

438
00:18:51,377 --> 00:18:55,396
And like most superstars,
she knows what she's good at...

439
00:18:55,398 --> 00:18:57,999
And what she isn't.

440
00:18:58,001 --> 00:18:59,500
If I didn't know any better, I'd think

441
00:18:59,502 --> 00:19:01,235
you were suggesting
she poisoned herself

442
00:19:01,237 --> 00:19:02,503
to get out of her contract.

443
00:19:02,505 --> 00:19:03,871
I did not say that, Michael,

444
00:19:03,873 --> 00:19:09,093
but it would've made a better story.

445
00:19:09,095 --> 00:19:11,345
You gonna sit down and order something?

446
00:19:11,347 --> 00:19:14,382
No. I'm... I'm waiting
for my friend.

447
00:19:14,384 --> 00:19:16,584
Get you something while you wait, then?

448
00:19:16,586 --> 00:19:19,687
No.
Thanks.

449
00:19:19,689 --> 00:19:22,256
I'm Jimmy, by the way.

450
00:19:22,258 --> 00:19:25,443
Do you talk
to all your customers this much?

451
00:19:25,445 --> 00:19:27,278
Are you a customer?

452
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,063
Mm, I thought
you were just another actress

453
00:19:29,065 --> 00:19:30,598
taking a meeting at my station

454
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,367
who won't order anything
but a glass of water.

455
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:35,453
I'm not like that.

456
00:19:35,455 --> 00:19:37,038
Karen?

457
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,123
Michael Riedel.

458
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,708
I can't wait to see you in the show.

459
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,109
- Oh.
- I hear amazing things.

460
00:19:42,111 --> 00:19:45,796
Thanks.
Thank you.

461
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:48,249
Still or sparkling?

462
00:19:48,251 --> 00:19:51,052
Tap.

463
00:19:51,054 --> 00:19:52,637
Hey.

464
00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:55,640
I got your text.
Is everything okay?

465
00:19:55,642 --> 00:19:58,893
Did you know about Ivy
singing at the party?

466
00:19:58,895 --> 00:20:00,394
No.

467
00:20:00,396 --> 00:20:02,480
I keep thinking about what Ronnie said

468
00:20:02,482 --> 00:20:04,148
about protecting the work,

469
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,900
and I'm worried
I won't be able to with Ivy

470
00:20:05,902 --> 00:20:07,401
in my face all the time.
I mean, I thought...

471
00:20:07,403 --> 00:20:09,136
Just say the word...

472
00:20:09,138 --> 00:20:13,140
And I will let her go.

473
00:20:13,142 --> 00:20:16,410
Okay.

474
00:20:16,412 --> 00:20:19,413
Consider it done.

475
00:20:19,415 --> 00:20:21,315
How was your meeting with Casey?

476
00:20:21,317 --> 00:20:24,585
He offered me the general
in the<i>book of mormon</i>tour.

477
00:20:24,587 --> 00:20:27,488
Wow! That's...
I mean, congratulations! Wow!

478
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,256
Eh, it's a great part, but I think

479
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:30,925
I'm gonna stay in the city, you know?

480
00:20:30,927 --> 00:20:33,928
For<i>bombsh...</i>
<i>You have ten lines in our show.</i>

481
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,763
In <i>mormon,</i> you'd be front and center.

482
00:20:35,765 --> 00:20:37,765
Without you.

483
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:40,000
Sometimes you have
to put what's right for you

484
00:20:40,002 --> 00:20:42,002
above what's right for someone else.

485
00:20:42,004 --> 00:20:43,837
Have you ever done that?

486
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:45,356
You didn't allow yourself
to feel a second of happiness

487
00:20:45,358 --> 00:20:46,840
over the reviews you got.

488
00:20:46,842 --> 00:20:48,359
I mean, what did <i>Variety</i> say again?

489
00:20:48,361 --> 00:20:50,778
I... [Sighs]
"Levitt's score is a marvel,

490
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,531
"full of charm and pizzazz
in its pastiche numbers

491
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:56,817
and unparalleled emotion
in its introspective moments."

492
00:20:56,819 --> 00:20:59,537
Look, I allowed myself
some happiness in private.

493
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:00,988
I just didn't want it to seem

494
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,790
like I was gloating around Julia.

495
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:04,458
I mean, she got...
Slammed in reviews

496
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,694
she doesn't even know about.
[Sighs]

497
00:21:06,696 --> 00:21:09,380
They loved her lyrics.

498
00:21:09,382 --> 00:21:11,632
I'll tell her, in time, just not yet.

499
00:21:11,634 --> 00:21:14,868
Her focus needs to be on her marriage.

500
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:17,004
We're partners, Sam.
It's my job to protect her.

501
00:21:17,006 --> 00:21:18,372
As her partner, it's your job

502
00:21:18,374 --> 00:21:19,807
to be the one person who doesn't.

503
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:20,874
I mean, if you can't tell her, who can?

504
00:21:20,876 --> 00:21:22,226
Maybe I'll never have to.

505
00:21:22,228 --> 00:21:25,396
Maybe she'll figure out her problems...

506
00:21:25,398 --> 00:21:27,565
Is that...

507
00:21:27,567 --> 00:21:29,600
Frank?

508
00:21:33,522 --> 00:21:35,239
Huh.

509
00:21:43,432 --> 00:21:45,700
- Oh, my God, is this for real?
- Yeah.

has just released a statement

"but because the director, Derek Wills,

sexually harassed her
in her dressing room."

515

Is this some sort of joke?

if it meant more light
on her downstage.

This must be
what Derek called me about.

Find you guys later?

521
00:22:10,293 --> 00:22:12,060
There's something
I have to take care of first.

- Good luck.
- Your life depends on it.

Thanks for understanding.

What, some actress
throwing you under the bus

00:22:19,152 --> 00:22:20,652
to save face?

526
00:22:20,654 --> 00:22:22,404
You may be a womanizer,

527
00:22:22,406 --> 00:22:24,439
but I know there's no merit
to her story.

528
00:22:24,441 --> 00:22:25,824
Yeah, well, you might want to tell that

529
00:22:25,826 --> 00:22:28,109
to the producers of <i>The Wiz</i> for me.

530
00:22:28,111 --> 00:22:30,478

Uh, I'm sorry to ambush you.

I'm Karen, by the way.

953
00:43:09,056 --> 00:43:11,823
Um, I left you a few messages,
but you never called back.

954
00:43:11,825 --> 00:43:14,826
Girls just usually call
to yell at me, so...

955
00:43:14,828 --> 00:43:17,145
Well, that's not
what I was calling to do.

956
00:43:17,147 --> 00:43:19,097
I was hoping we could talk
about your music.

957
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:20,315
My what?

958
00:43:20,317 --> 00:43:21,632
You guys are writing a musical.

959
00:43:21,634 --> 00:43:22,817
I mean, I'd love to hear more.

960
00:43:22,819 --> 00:43:24,235
There's nothing to hear.

961
00:43:24,237 --> 00:43:26,404
I don't...
I don't write anything.

962
00:43:26,406 --> 00:43:27,989
So the song you played
last week after closing,

963
00:43:27,991 --> 00:43:29,474
that wasn't yours?

964
00:43:29,476 --> 00:43:31,142
Your friend just lied

965
00:43:31,144 --> 00:43:32,761
when he said it was from your musical?

966
00:43:32,763 --> 00:43:34,746
- Are you always like this?
- Like what?

967
00:43:34,748 --> 00:43:36,498
[Laughs] Uptight.

968
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,316
I mean, if you stopped
clenching your jaw like that,

969
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:39,834
you know, you could actually be cute.

970
00:43:39,836 --> 00:43:41,669
- I don't clench my jaw.
- Relax.

971
00:43:41,671 --> 00:43:45,340
- That's really rude.
- Okay, you're doing it again.

972
00:43:45,342 --> 00:43:47,592
You know, my...
My shift's over at 5:00,

973
00:43:47,594 --> 00:43:49,461
if you want to hang out.

974
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:51,629
No, I don't...

975
00:43:51,631 --> 00:43:54,132
I don't want to hang out.
I just want...

976
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:56,184
You know what?
Forget it.

977
00:43:56,186 --> 00:44:00,004
See ya.

978
00:44:00,006 --> 00:44:01,672
Dude, was that Karen Cartwright?

979
00:44:01,674 --> 00:44:03,341
No idea.

980
00:44:03,343 --> 00:44:04,943
She's the girl I told you about,

981
00:44:04,945 --> 00:44:06,344
the one that was here the other night.

982
00:44:06,346 --> 00:44:08,446
She's a big deal.
She could help us.

983
00:44:08,448 --> 00:44:10,098
We do it on our own, all right?

984
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,849
We don't need anyone's help.

985
00:44:11,851 --> 00:44:14,402
Move it.
I'm late.

986
00:44:16,355 --> 00:44:18,790
Derek, it's me. Um, I just
wanted to let you know

987
00:44:18,792 --> 00:44:20,792
I finally got in touch
with that composer.

988
00:44:20,794 --> 00:44:22,693
- Hey! Hey, Karen, wait up!
- Um, it turn...

989
00:44:22,695 --> 00:44:26,297
And... um, I got
to call you back.

990
00:44:26,299 --> 00:44:28,699
Hey.
Hey.

991
00:44:28,701 --> 00:44:30,718
Look, I'm sorry about whatever
he said to you back there.

992
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,836
That guy's your friend, right?

993
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:33,371
Why, exactly?
I know.

994
00:44:33,373 --> 00:44:35,056
He's complicated.

995
00:44:35,058 --> 00:44:36,558
But he's a really good guy
when you get to know him

996
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,176
and an amazing composer.

997
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:39,978
He's just really protective
of our stuff.

998
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:41,846
Well, I wanted to hear more,
play it for my friend Derek,

999
00:44:41,848 --> 00:44:44,182
see what he thought.
Derek, as in Derek Wills?

1000
00:44:44,184 --> 00:44:47,218
[Chuckles] Like... like
<i>the</i> Derek Wills? He's, uh...

1001
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,020
Irrelevant to this conversation,

1002
00:44:49,022 --> 00:44:50,572
since your friend
clearly isn't interested.

1003
00:44:50,574 --> 00:44:52,073
Yes, he is.

1004
00:44:52,075 --> 00:44:54,075
He just doesn't know it yet,
and so am I.

1005
00:44:54,077 --> 00:44:55,860
Look, can you meet me
in a couple hours,

1006
00:44:55,862 --> 00:44:57,362
when I'm done with my shift?

1007
00:44:57,364 --> 00:44:59,864
There's something I want to show you.

1008
00:44:59,866 --> 00:45:02,200
I realize your clients
haven't gotten paid, Saul.

1009
00:45:02,202 --> 00:45:04,335
No one has.
I'm truly sorry.

1010
00:45:04,337 --> 00:45:07,255
But mark my words, I'll have
this all ironed out,

1011
00:45:07,257 --> 00:45:08,406
<i>tout de suite!</i>

1012
00:45:08,408 --> 00:45:11,909
Now, if you'll excuse me...

1013
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:16,047
The fact I was able to stage
a single number

1014
00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:17,715
in the middle of that circus
you and Julia created

1015
00:45:17,717 --> 00:45:19,250
is nothing short of a miracle.

1016
00:45:19,252 --> 00:45:21,085
"Circus"... how choice.

1017
00:45:21,087 --> 00:45:24,755
Let's talk about you juggling
every Marilyn in the show.

1018
00:45:24,757 --> 00:45:27,392
Boys, there's nothing to be gained

1019
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:29,227
by turning on each other.

1020
00:45:29,229 --> 00:45:30,945
But it feels good.

1021
00:45:30,947 --> 00:45:34,932
All right, then...
Maybe we should turn on you.

1022
00:45:34,934 --> 00:45:37,735
Did it not even seem
a little bit strange to you

1023
00:45:37,737 --> 00:45:40,238
that a Brooklyn bartender
and his funny little friends

1024
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,123
had millions of dollars
in cash lying around?

1025
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:44,075
I have spent the last three hours

1026
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:46,978
with the federal government
and my accountant,

1027
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,447
going through every bill,
receipt, and pay stub

1028
00:45:49,449 --> 00:45:51,032
since the beginning of time.

1029
00:45:51,034 --> 00:45:52,634
It's all in order.

1030
00:45:52,636 --> 00:45:54,819
Did they say
when we could get back to work?

1031
00:45:54,821 --> 00:45:57,255
No, but we're still alive.

1032
00:45:57,257 --> 00:46:00,892
Karen is singing tonight at
the American theatre wing gala.

1033
00:46:00,894 --> 00:46:03,294
Every Broadway bigwig will be there.

1034
00:46:03,296 --> 00:46:05,763
So, for now, I'd like
to ask both of you

1035
00:46:05,765 --> 00:46:08,066
please not to accept any other project

1036
00:46:08,068 --> 00:46:09,800
until all of this is settled.

1037
00:46:09,802 --> 00:46:11,653
Yeah, I can't make that
guarantee... I need to work.

1038
00:46:11,655 --> 00:46:14,639
You have offers
after last week's revelations?

1039
00:46:14,641 --> 00:46:16,257
Yeah.

1040
00:46:16,259 --> 00:46:18,243
Rebecca Duvall has moved on,
so have the tabloids.

1041
00:46:18,245 --> 00:46:19,911
So, beyond directing

1042
00:46:19,913 --> 00:46:22,163
one of Broadway's
biggest stars in <i>The Wiz,</i>

1043
00:46:22,165 --> 00:46:24,982
- yes, I have several offers.
- Amazing.

1044
00:46:24,984 --> 00:46:26,150
What a business.

1045
00:46:26,152 --> 00:46:27,168
Oh, Tom.

1046
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:28,603
Did you pack something warm

1047
00:46:28,605 --> 00:46:30,588
for your trip to the moral high ground?

1048
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:32,257
Why don't you both
get out of my office?

1049
00:46:32,259 --> 00:46:35,493
I'll let you know what happens tonight.

1050
00:46:35,495 --> 00:46:37,762
Julia and I are here for you,
whatever you need.

1051
00:46:37,764 --> 00:46:39,297
You are.

1052
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:41,666
This is the third meeting
Julia's missed.

1053
00:46:41,668 --> 00:46:43,468
She had a college thing with Leo.

1054
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:45,637
[Phone ringing]

1055
00:46:47,806 --> 00:46:50,508
It's Miriam Abramson's office
on line e... on

1056
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:53,511
the American theatre wing.

1057
00:46:53,513 --> 00:46:55,446
I'm so jealous.

1058
00:46:55,448 --> 00:46:57,348
You're going on tour
with <i>The Book of Mormon,</i>

1059
00:46:57,350 --> 00:46:59,850
and I can't even get a callback
for an eHarmony commercial.

1060
00:46:59,852 --> 00:47:01,686
You got to bug your agent more.

1061
00:47:01,688 --> 00:47:03,655
Are you kidding me?
That's all I've been doing.

1062
00:47:03,657 --> 00:47:05,323
But you are Ivy Lynn.

1063
00:47:05,325 --> 00:47:07,208
She don't stay down for long.

1064
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:08,993
At least you're not Lisa McMann.

1065
00:47:08,995 --> 00:47:10,662
Approaching, approaching.
Oh, my God, oh, my God,

1066
00:47:10,664 --> 00:47:12,863
oh, my God, oh, my God...
I cannot face that woman today.

1067
00:47:12,865 --> 00:47:16,701
She's been plugging away
longer than I have.

1068
00:47:16,703 --> 00:47:19,370
Ivy? And Sam?

1069
00:47:19,372 --> 00:47:21,506
- [Squeals] Oh, my God!
- Lisa McMann!

1070
00:47:21,508 --> 00:47:23,141
- Hi!
- Oh!

1071
00:47:23,143 --> 00:47:24,559
This is too funny!

1072
00:47:24,561 --> 00:47:26,711
I was just thinking about you guys

1073
00:47:26,713 --> 00:47:28,146
and that awful Shakespeare festival

1074
00:47:28,148 --> 00:47:29,880
we did in the adirondacks.

1075
00:47:29,882 --> 00:47:32,400
Ugh, don't remind me.
[Laughs]

1076
00:47:32,402 --> 00:47:35,219
So what have you been up to?

1077
00:47:35,221 --> 00:47:37,238
Stationery!

1078
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,856
Yeah!

1079
00:47:38,858 --> 00:47:42,193
I got out of the biz,
and my whole life changed.

1080
00:47:42,195 --> 00:47:44,061
Now I make my own hours.

1081
00:47:44,063 --> 00:47:45,530
People actually want
what I'm offering...

1082
00:47:45,532 --> 00:47:47,415
No more rejection,
rejection, rejection.

1083
00:47:47,417 --> 00:47:50,401
Oh, um...
Here is my guesthouse.

1084
00:47:50,403 --> 00:47:52,370
Yeah.
[Giggles]

1085
00:47:52,372 --> 00:47:54,589
Oh, how about you guys?

1086
00:47:58,043 --> 00:47:59,744
Hello, darling.

1087
00:47:59,746 --> 00:48:01,879
How's my second favorite
agent in the world?

1088
00:48:01,881 --> 00:48:03,881
Oh.
Very sweet.

1089
00:48:03,883 --> 00:48:05,082
Loving the purple.

1090
00:48:05,084 --> 00:48:06,551
- Thank you.
- So...

1091
00:48:06,553 --> 00:48:07,885
Got some news for me?

1092
00:48:07,887 --> 00:48:09,587
What's happening with <i>The Wiz?</i>

1093
00:48:09,589 --> 00:48:11,756
Well, Ronnie's a big fan, as you know,

1094
00:48:11,758 --> 00:48:13,591
and she remains that way.

1095
00:48:13,593 --> 00:48:16,394
She fought hard for you
with the producers.

1096
00:48:16,396 --> 00:48:17,729
Whoa, wait.

1097
00:48:17,731 --> 00:48:20,515
Am I hearing a past tense in there?

1098
00:48:20,517 --> 00:48:22,099
They're letting you go.

1099
00:48:22,101 --> 00:48:24,435
Just because I shagged
a couple of actresses?

1100
00:48:24,437 --> 00:48:25,903
That's ludicrous.

1101
00:48:25,905 --> 00:48:28,039
Well, it's not just because of that.

1102
00:48:28,041 --> 00:48:29,940
The local news has a story.

1103
00:48:29,942 --> 00:48:31,576
We got the heads-up
an hour ago.

1104
00:48:31,578 --> 00:48:34,612
Five dancers have come forward

1105
00:48:34,614 --> 00:48:37,448
and are accusing you
of sexual harassment.

1106
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:39,801
I have the names here somewhere.

1107
00:48:39,803 --> 00:48:41,386
Um...

1108
00:48:41,388 --> 00:48:43,621
I don't want to talk
to her assistant again.

1109
00:48:43,623 --> 00:48:46,257
I want to talk to her.

1110
00:48:47,593 --> 00:48:49,811
Looks nothing like you.
[Chuckling]

1111
00:48:49,813 --> 00:48:52,397
I knew I should have moved offices.

1112
00:48:52,399 --> 00:48:55,483
Jerry...

1113
00:48:55,485 --> 00:48:58,403
I'm in a particularly tight spot,

1114
00:48:58,405 --> 00:48:59,604
and you owe me.

1115
00:48:59,606 --> 00:49:01,122
- I do?
- Yes.

1116
00:49:01,124 --> 00:49:02,940
You're giving me your table tonight

1117
00:49:02,942 --> 00:49:04,659
for the American theatre wing gala.

1118
00:49:04,661 --> 00:49:06,477
I thought you were already going.

1119
00:49:06,479 --> 00:49:08,279
I thought I was too.

1120
00:49:08,281 --> 00:49:11,132
But Miriam Abramson's
assistant called to say

1121
00:49:11,134 --> 00:49:12,950
that I am no longer on the guest list.

1122
00:49:12,952 --> 00:49:14,969
Is that so?

1123
00:49:14,971 --> 00:49:18,172
I have only a small window
of opportunity for <i>Bombshell,</i>

1124
00:49:18,174 --> 00:49:20,007
and I will not have it closed.

1125
00:49:20,009 --> 00:49:22,510
I refuse to be treated like a criminal.

1126
00:49:22,512 --> 00:49:24,762
So...

1127
00:49:24,764 --> 00:49:26,848
You want to be my date, hmm?

1128
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:28,666
[Laughs] Oh, no.
You're not going.

1129
00:49:28,668 --> 00:49:30,852
It'll be just me and my creative team.

1130
00:49:30,854 --> 00:49:33,604
I hear Julia's a mess.

1131
00:49:33,606 --> 00:49:36,023
<i>The Wiz</i> dropped Derek
like a hot potato.

1132
00:49:36,025 --> 00:49:39,794
Julia's fine.
And so is Derek.

1133
00:49:39,796 --> 00:49:42,363
My team couldn't be more unified.

1134
00:49:42,365 --> 00:49:45,149
They'll sail through.

1135
00:49:45,151 --> 00:49:47,852
You're welcome.

1136
00:49:47,854 --> 00:49:52,156
[Cell phone vibrating]

1137
00:49:52,158 --> 00:49:54,792
[Cell phone ringing]

1138
00:49:54,794 --> 00:49:56,210
Hello?

1139
00:49:56,212 --> 00:49:57,545
Hi, boys.

1140
00:49:57,547 --> 00:49:59,664
I need Julia too.
Is she there?

1141
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:02,800
Oh, she's meeting with her realtor.

1142
00:50:02,802 --> 00:50:04,034
What's going on, Eileen?

1143
00:50:04,036 --> 00:50:05,636
I'm on my way home.

1144
00:50:05,638 --> 00:50:07,388
Okay, we've got
a slight change of plans.

1145
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:09,707
Karen's no longer singing tonight.

1146
00:50:09,709 --> 00:50:11,559
Instead, it'll be the four of us,

1147
00:50:11,561 --> 00:50:13,177
8:00 at the Plaza,

1148
00:50:13,179 --> 00:50:15,680
and I want you on
your best behavior, all of you...

1149
00:50:15,682 --> 00:50:18,716
No fighting, no surprises, no scandals.

1150
00:50:18,718 --> 00:50:19,734
Is that understood?

1151
00:50:19,736 --> 00:50:21,903
Bloody paparazzo.

1152
00:50:21,905 --> 00:50:23,521
Of course.

1153
00:50:23,523 --> 00:50:26,357
And, Tom, tell Julia
it's cocktail attire.

1154
00:50:26,359 --> 00:50:28,075
Yep.

1155
00:50:28,077 --> 00:50:29,577
No!

1156
00:50:32,364 --> 00:50:34,615
[Clears throat loudly]

1157
00:50:36,883 --> 00:50:38,584
No, I can't, not tonight.

1158
00:50:38,671 --> 00:50:40,038
I'm not up for it, maybe tomorrow.

1159
00:50:40,805 --> 00:50:42,738
You have to.
Eileen needs us.

1160
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,323
Besides, it's been a week.

1161
00:50:44,325 --> 00:50:46,075
You're starting to merge
with the couch.

1162
00:50:46,077 --> 00:50:47,643
Some air will be good for you.

1163
00:50:47,645 --> 00:50:51,263
I got some air today.
I met Leo in Riverside Park.

1164
00:50:51,265 --> 00:50:54,266
And then you came home
and put your pajamas back on?

1165
00:50:54,268 --> 00:50:56,802
I may have met him in them.

1166
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,621
Julia!

1167
00:50:58,623 --> 00:51:00,506
Look, it's...
It's bad enough

1168
00:51:00,508 --> 00:51:02,425
that I destroyed my family.

1169
00:51:02,427 --> 00:51:05,628
Now Frank is telling people,
and everyone is writing me.

1170
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:08,631
I have to relive the whole thing
every time I check my email!

1171
00:51:08,633 --> 00:51:11,667
I know it's hard,
but we can't abandon <i>Bombshell</i>

1172
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:13,335
in her hour of need.

1173
00:51:13,337 --> 00:51:15,671
None of your relatives are gonna
be at the thing tonight.

1174
00:51:15,673 --> 00:51:17,456
No, just industry people...
That's worse.

1175
00:51:17,458 --> 00:51:18,774
They'll eat me alive.

1176
00:51:18,776 --> 00:51:20,192
Look, if there was anywhere else

1177
00:51:20,194 --> 00:51:21,944
that you wanted me to go
with you tonight...

1178
00:51:21,946 --> 00:51:25,180
The Bronx zoo, whole foods...
The shower?

1179
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:31,954
I am asking my friend Tom

1180
00:51:31,956 --> 00:51:34,523
to tell my partner Tom

1181
00:51:34,525 --> 00:51:37,510
that I need the night off.

1182
00:51:37,512 --> 00:51:39,662
Please?

1183
00:51:39,664 --> 00:51:41,797
I will tell Eileen you're sick

1184
00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:44,633
and represent the team myself.

1185
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:47,703
Thank you.
You're the best.

1186
00:51:47,705 --> 00:51:49,555
Yes, I am.

1187
00:51:49,557 --> 00:51:52,975
And I promise, I'll get back up soon.

1188
00:51:52,977 --> 00:51:56,278
Just a...
Just a little longer?

1189
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:02,818
This is... this is what
you wanted to show me?

1190
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,553
He doesn't write anything down, really,

1191
00:52:04,555 --> 00:52:07,890
except, occasionally, when he's wasted.

1192
00:52:07,892 --> 00:52:10,192
Uh, this one is particularly amazing.

1193
00:52:10,194 --> 00:52:11,660
He doesn't know I saved it.
Read the lyrics.

1194
00:52:11,662 --> 00:52:13,496
I think they start
on the cocktail menu.

1195
00:52:13,498 --> 00:52:15,998
I don't understand... do you
guys have a musical or not?

1196
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,534
We do.
We're still working on it,

1197
00:52:18,536 --> 00:52:20,036
but most of the songs are written.

1198
00:52:20,038 --> 00:52:23,422
Does your friend even know you're here?

1199
00:52:23,424 --> 00:52:25,875
- Uh...
- Look...

1200
00:52:25,877 --> 00:52:27,910
I just came from a clearasil audition

1201
00:52:27,912 --> 00:52:30,079
and then found out the one thing
I was looking forward to

1202
00:52:30,081 --> 00:52:31,931
got canceled tonight,
so you can understand

1203
00:52:31,933 --> 00:52:34,266
I was hoping to get involved
with something that's real.

1204
00:52:34,268 --> 00:52:36,585
This obviously isn't it.

1205
00:52:36,587 --> 00:52:38,387
Let me know if it ever
comes together, okay?

1206
00:52:38,389 --> 00:52:41,090
Find someone to play this for you.

1207
00:52:41,092 --> 00:52:44,226
And if you like it
or you want to hear more,

1208
00:52:44,228 --> 00:52:47,897
come to our place tonight...
We're having some people over.

1209
00:52:47,899 --> 00:52:50,950
Maybe if you stop by and got
to know Jimmy a little better,

1210
00:52:50,952 --> 00:52:55,371
he'd let his guard down,
play you some stuff.

1211
00:52:55,373 --> 00:52:57,740
Think about it?

1212
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:02,878
[Buzzer sounds]

1213
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,214
[Woman speaking indistinctly
on television]

1214
00:53:05,216 --> 00:53:08,117
Um...

1215
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:09,969
You can just...

1216
00:53:09,971 --> 00:53:12,221
Leave it at the door, whatever it is!

1217
00:53:12,223 --> 00:53:13,756
Thank you!

1218
00:53:13,758 --> 00:53:15,758
Julia?

1219
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,260
It's Ivy.
Oh!

1220
00:53:22,649 --> 00:53:25,317
Hello, Daisy.
Can I have a word?

1221
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:27,987
- I can't talk to you, Derek.
- Oh, yeah, you can.

1222
00:53:27,989 --> 00:53:30,305
We need to have a little chat
about your understanding

1223
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:32,408
of the phrase
"sexual harassment."

1224
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:33,943
You know I never touched you.

1225
00:53:33,945 --> 00:53:35,744
I didn't say you did.

1226
00:53:35,746 --> 00:53:38,614
You only hit on me through
four callbacks of <i>Sweet charity,</i>

1227
00:53:38,616 --> 00:53:40,749
and when I finally said
I wouldn't sleep with you,

1228
00:53:40,751 --> 00:53:42,451
I mysteriously lost out on the job.

1229
00:53:42,453 --> 00:53:44,286
Oh, well, as I recall,
you didn't get the job

1230
00:53:44,288 --> 00:53:45,821
'cause, while you were
a pretty good dancer,

1231
00:53:45,823 --> 00:53:47,623
you were only an okay actress,
which is why,

1232
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:51,927
after all these years,
you're still teaching pilates.

1233
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:53,762
You're unbelievable.

1234
00:53:53,764 --> 00:53:55,431
Is that really
what you came here to say?

1235
00:53:55,433 --> 00:53:57,199
Yeah, pretty much.

1236
00:53:57,201 --> 00:54:00,436
Since when is it harassment
to ask someone out on a date?

1237
00:54:00,438 --> 00:54:01,837
You don't get it.

1238
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:03,606
