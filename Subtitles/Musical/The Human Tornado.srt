00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,669
Well I say one thing,
he can lay heavy

34
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,549

00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:01,015

00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,905
But a damn sight more of it.

00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,491
Is that your husband?

44
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:19,871
Ain't that a damn shame?

45
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,123
You need a little
skinny man, baby.

46
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,205
You and that man get

47
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,418

but I don't have to
take all that shit.

52
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,645
Young lady went out with her
boyfriend the other night,

53
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,655
and he got into bed
with her and pulled out

54
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,482
something like my little finger.

55
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:49,904
She looked at it and said,

56
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,699
well you no-screwing,
pencil-dick,

57
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,867
Pistol-Peter son of a gun.

00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,161
Says I tell you what
I will do for you.

59
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,080
Since you can't
do nothing for me

60
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,204
with a joint that small,

61
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,582
said I'll give you $50
if you can hurt me.

62
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,630
He screwed her three
times and hit her

63
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,674
in the head with a rock.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,297
(crowd applause)

65
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,129
There's some ugly mother
fuckers in this house tonight.

66
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:17,216
If you don't believe
it, look over here.

67
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:18,892
Baby

68
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:23,772
you are so ugly you stopped
this motion picture from runnin.

69
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,067
Yo lips like you wearing
a turtleneck sweater.

70
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,860
I had a brother
look just like you,

71
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,466
he stuck his head out the window

72
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,405
and his lips beat him to death.

73
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,693
My my my, that's what
I call stretching

74
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,028
a good thing a bit too far.

75
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,954
Two soldiers went to Vietnam,

76
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,954
a black soldier and a white
soldier, can you dig it?

77
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,683
And they come all
the way back home,

78
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,711
and the people in
Louisiana said we gonna

79
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,914
give y'all anything
that y'all want.

80
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,887
They looked at the
white soldier and said,

81
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,328
young man, what do you want?

82
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,252
He said, well I'll tell
you all what I want.

83
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:58,716
I want me $10,000 and a
Lincoln Continental to drive.

84
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,851
They said, we gonna
get that for you.

85
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,071
Then they looked at the
brother, they said brother,

86
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,096
what would you like?

87
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,898
The brother said, well

88
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,022
y'all can give me
a dollar and a half

89
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,854
from the head of my
ding-a-ling down to my balls.

90
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,606
They said brother, brother,

91
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,863
don't you want no
more than that?

92
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,115
He said, no that's all I want.

93
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,044
So he pulled it out
and they put a dollar

94
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,231
and a half at the head of it.

95
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,883
Then they put another
dollar and a half on it,

96
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,107
and another dollar and a half,

97
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,497
another dollar and a half,

98
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,124
and another dollar and a half.

99
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,296
And one of those fellas
looked at him and said,

100
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:33,171
nigga, where is your balls at?

101
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,838
He said in Vietnam.

102
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:42,722
(crowd applauds)

103
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,956
Young lady took her boyfriend
out with her the other night.

104
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,264
You know?

105
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,017
She got into bed with him,

106
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,945
and baby he did his thang before
he could get on top of her.

107
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,739
And he looked at her and said,

108
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,943
go in the kitchen
and fix me some food.

109
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,370
She went in the
kitchen and brought him

110
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,539
a head of lettuce and
a bowl of carrots.

111
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:05,863
He looked at her and said,

112
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,750
why in the world did
you bring me these

113
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,044
carrots and lettuce out here?

114
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,293
She looked at him,
said, mother fucker

00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,222

116
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,877

117
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,130
- Dolemite you might

118
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:20,756

123
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,988

129
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:19,615
(light funk music)

130
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,242
- You really came at a bad time.

131
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:30,075
I'm very very busy.

132
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,378
Relax, take off your thangs,
and I'll see you later.

133
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:45,057
- I've invited you
all here to inform you

134
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,384
that the money drive
that was planned

135
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,845
six months ago by our
planning committee,

136
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,180
to purchase a new boys home,

137
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,687
has been called abruptly closed.

138
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,815
(crowd murmurs)

139
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,277
But along with the bad news,

140
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,825
there's always good news.

141
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,868
I'm going to allow the man

142
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,992
that's caused all
of this to happen.

143
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,120
Your friend and mine,
brother Dolemite.

144
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:15,545
(crowd applauds)

145
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,255
- Thank you.

146
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,097
I'm so glad you could come.

147
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,596
As you know I've been
having a lot of hard knocks.

148
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,474
And a lot of trials
and tribulations.

149
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,607
And I've had a lot of success.

150
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,104
And I think it's a shame
for anyone successful

151
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,819
not to share it with others.

152
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,077
So today I'm doing
something that I wanted

153
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,325
to do for a long time.

154
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,624
I'm giving my home
and its entirety

155
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:59,335
to the gentleman that started
the drive for the boys home.

156
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,087
(crowd applauds)

157
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:05,512
Let us now talk to some of

161
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,749
You're worth every
damn cent I pay you.

162
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,388
- Jethro, stop the car.

163
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,181

00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,454

- Now look boys, we

458
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:49,908
And my people are mad at me.

459
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:52,487
Now with Queen Bee's club
taking in all the business,

460
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,664
my place is coming up
like a funeral parlor.

461
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,742
And my backers in Florida
ain't so happy about it.

462
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,916
They're pressuring me.

463
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:04,544
And this kinda
pressure I don't need.

464
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,046
Now something's gotta
be done about it, right?

465
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:10,425
Okay, now Carl here is gonna
act as my enforcer.

466
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:14,342
Now I want Queen
Bee's place shut down.

467
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:15,676
- Jimmy baby.

468
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,010
- [Jimmy] Yeah, Queen?

469
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,470
- Oh, we!

470
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,353
Two more nights like this,

471
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:24,230
and maybe we can
make up for them

472
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,812
two lousy weekends we had.

473
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,186
You know why?

474
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:28,864
- Why's that Ma, what is it?

475
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,283
- Java's really packing them in.

476
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,406
I should have had her
here a long time ago.

477
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,032
- Right on baby.

478
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,006
And you know I haven't
seen this many niggas

479
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,498
in here since Dolemite was here.

480
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,748
And my catch action
tonight was heavy.

481
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,330
If I was you I'd hold
on for a couple weeks.

482
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,663
- I heard that.

483
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,083
- Yes sir!

484
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,813
- Thank God we don't have to
see this place until tomorrow.

485
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:02,310
Girl my feet are hurting.

486
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,391
I feel like I wanna scream.

487
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:05,897
- Right on Java.

488
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,944
- Oh, fix me a drink baby.

489
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,866
How did we do tonight, Queenie?

490
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,614
- Not bad baby.

491
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,911
In fact you can look for
a bonus with your check.

492
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,534
You deserve it.

493
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,491
- That's what I like to hear.

494
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:21,950
- Here baby.

495
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:23,678
And as good as you
looked and the way

496
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,954

497
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,506
You can go anywhere
you want with me.

498
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,004
- Now what about
your lady over here?

499
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:33,304
(Queen laughs)

500
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,306
(slams chair)

501
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,307
- Oh excuse me,
I made a mistake.

502
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:47,568
- That's okay, lemme
give you a hand okay?

503
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:48,940
- Alright.

504
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,192
(smashes chairs)

505
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,148
- What kinda shit is this?

506
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:00,706
(fight sounds)

507
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,952
(gunfire)

508
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:08,038
- Everybody freeze!

509
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,674
(punching sound)

510
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:27,771
- You the hard-hitting
lady owner?

511
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,523
Well maybe this'll teach you.

512
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,610
The boss wants you to learn.

513
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,783
(punching sound)

514
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,953
(Queen screams and moans)

515
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:58,009
- Queen!

516
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,590

544
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:45,366
I wonder why the boss picked
this place to come here.

545
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,117
- He likes the old lady.

546
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,824
Besides, he gets his nuts

547
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,034

- I'll take your money, but you
didn't cause me any trouble.

564
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,647
I've always wanted to
come to California.

565
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,321
By the looks of the
things out here,

566
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,990
someone's gonna have to
kidnap me to take me back.

567
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,819

568
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,785

00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,614
- Queen what's happening?

723
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,027
What in the world are you
doing in a joint like this?

724
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,243
- Honey shit done got heavy.

725
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:19,204
Cavaletti sent some
of his apes down.

726
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,539
Beat me like a dog.

727
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:24,672
And kidnapped TC and Java.

728
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:27,675
- Kidnapped em, what you mean?

729
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:30,473
- Kidnap em, and forced us
to come and work for him.

730
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,678
And said that if I didn't
come and work for him,

731
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:34,352
he'd kill em.

732
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:35,974
- Cavaletti must
be nuts to think

733
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:38,306
he can get away with
some shit like that.

734
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,312
Who the hell does
he think he is?

735
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,941
- That's what I wanna know.

736
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,817
He must think he is

737
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:48,275
the new Godfather
or some kinda shit.

738
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,457
- He's pissed cause I was
making more money than he was.

739
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:58,000
Here he come now, look.

740
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,833
- Your ice is melting Queenie.

741
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:03,085
What's with the chatter?

742
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:05,963
- They were just
some friends of mine,

743
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,612
and they was looking
for somebody.

744
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:08,378
- Friends, huh?

745
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:09,928
Now look sweetie.

746
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,214
Since you work for us, you
can't have any friends.

747
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,382
Now get back to work.

748
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:18,559
Well folks, I want you to know

749
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:20,561
the next act is about to start.

750
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,107
I want you to catch it.

751
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,855
You'll love it.

752
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:26,438
(chuckles)

753
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:32,493
(chill piano music)

754
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,353
- I'd take care of
you now sweetheart,

755
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:49,669
but I have other things to do.

756
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,148
But don't worry
I'll be back later.

757
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,402
Yeah.

758
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:13,905
(Turtleneck chuckles)

759
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:17,409
(Red shirt laughs)

760
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,992
- Java, what are we gonna do?

761
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,588
- I don't know girl.

762
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:28,132
But whatever it is,

763
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,925

764
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,589

00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,259

767
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:53,863
- Dolemite, I've been
waiting for you so long.

768
00:44:56,485 --> 00:45:00,035
- Baby, good things
come to those who wait.

769
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:17,890
- I see you didn't
keep your promise.

770
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:20,560

771
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:23,729
- But baby I've been busy.

772
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:28,063
- Not too busy to eat I see.

773
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:35,613
I want to make yourself
real comfortable.

774

Maybe a promotion.

We do have a mugshot.

854
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,998
But do you have a name or an ID?

855
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:36,871

- It looks like nobody can

867
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,098
They just wished he was new

868

- Oh baby, armies can
come large or small

880
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,133

881
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:50,926

888
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:06,017

This is from Joe.

00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:37,714
- She ain't coming.

898
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:39,317
- What do you mean
she's not coming?

899
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,388
Gimme that phone.

900
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:42,937
Queen Bee, you better

901
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:44,935

902
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:46,686
- Under one condition.

903
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,608
That you turn my girls loose.

904
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:51,528
- Look Bee, you're in no
position to bargain with me.

905
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:53,231
Now you get your
hot ass over here,

906
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:55,066
or I'll massacre
those black bitches.

907
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,864
I'll give you just one hour.

908
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:04,826
(dial tone)

909
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:08,504
- Why you rat-soup
eating motherfucker!

910
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:15,086
- I guess you heard all of that.

911
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:17,638
- That's all I needed to know.

912
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,011
That the girls are still alive.

913
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:24,811
Now I can work with that
cranny-dodging motherfucker.

914
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:26,434
So here's what we do.

915
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:30,609
- Brother QB what's happening?

916
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,060
- I wanna talk to you man.

917
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,247
- Oh I don't have time
fellas, I got a lot to do.

918
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:34,942
I'll talk to you later.

919
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,552
- Later on will be too late man,

920
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:37,649
we need to rap right now.

921
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,735
- That's right brother
man, right now.

922
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,320
- Oh some heavy shit, huh?

923
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:42,700
- Dig it.

924
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,328
- Okay, sock it to me.

925
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:48,001
Cavaletti's men blew away
my brother this morning.

926
00:54:48,327 --> 00:54:49,829
- Oh no, you mean Jeff is dead?

927
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:51,431
- That's why we come to you man.

928
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:52,581
We need your help.

929
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:54,517
- Okay I'll tell you
what we'll get together

930
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,964
this afternoon and see what
we can map out, alright?

931
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,563
- Say look here,
I got information

932
00:54:58,587 --> 00:54:59,964
on a house in Pasadena man,

933
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,049
where the motherfuckers
torture people.

934
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:03,929
- A torture chamber?

935
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:07,604
Goddamn I haven't heard of
no shit like that in years.

936
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:09,773
Listen, did you get
any information on

937
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:11,645
the guys that laid
your brother away?

938
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:12,521
- Yeah.

939
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,228
The motherfuckers was black.

940
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,359
- Yeah, brothers.

941
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:19,942
- Mannix, what's new
on the Sheriff case?

942
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,369
- Well I gotta see
some mugshots Chief.

943
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:23,991
- It's in the Dolemite file,

944
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:25,948
you've got everything we have.

945
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,841
- The Sheriff's case
is nothing compared

946
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:29,115
to what I've come up with.

947
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,581
Another 187.

948
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:32,709
This time the finger points to.

949
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:34,039
Mr. Cavaletti.

950
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:36,053
- [Chief] Cavaletti?
- [Pete] That's right.

951
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,166
- Do you have grounds?

952
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:39,424
- Well sir we share some
brotherly information.

953
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:40,753
- Good.

954
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:42,403
Gimme the information
and I'll assign

955
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:43,966
somebody else to the case.

956
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,299
I don't want you biting
off more than you can chew.

957
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:48,680
You concentrate on
the Sheriff case.

958
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,480
Get Dolemite.

959
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:53,396
- You mean you're
assigning me to help

960
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:55,161
some hokey Sheriff
solve a murder case

961
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,903
which we know nothing about?

962
00:55:57,229 --> 00:56:00,233
And for two years, I've
tried to nail Joe Cavaletti.

963
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:02,694
And finally I get this
asshole by his balls,

964
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,120
and you wanna assign
somebody else to the case?

965
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:06,445
- Now dammit Pete.

966
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,373
You will do as you're told.

967
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:09,699
- Good.

968
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,790
I remember the other day
I was told my vacation

969
00:56:11,994 --> 00:56:14,042
started today,
and I'm taking it.

970
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:19,009
- Son of a bitch.

971
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,634
- What brings you
this way my friend?

972
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:26,058
- I've got news for ya.

973
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:31,889
- How you know I'm
looking for needles?

974
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,658
- I heard through the
grapevine that you

975
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:34,962
were trying to get Queen's girls

976
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,480
back from Cavaletti, right?

977
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:39,905
- So?

978
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:43,276
- I got some real strong info
from some friends of mine.

979
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:56,462
- So let's have it.

980
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:58,586
- Info like that
don't grow on trees.

981
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,884
It costs money you know.

982
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:03,303
I got a sick aunt.

983
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:16,688
- Hold it.

984
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:20,275
Information first.

985
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:23,824
- Well Cavaletti's got
this house in Pasadena.

986
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:25,901
It's a real chamber of horrors.

987
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,532
Like he really fucks
people up over there man.

988
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,910
- Where's it at?

989
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,866
- I haven't found that out yet.

990
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,123
- Well how do you find out?

991
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,998
- If somebody was to get
Cavaletti's main woman,

992
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:41,959
then they might find
out where the house is.

993
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,715
- Where does Cavaletti
keep his main woman?

994
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,005
- Well

995
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:51,302
Cavaletti usually
keeps her at his pad.

996
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:53,308
She's a nice bitch.

997
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:56,311
I heard that she's a
common freak, you know?

998
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,233
A real nymphomaniac.

999
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,560
- Where's Cavaletti's house?

1000
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:03,147
- In Pasadena baby.

1001
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,902
(doorbell rings)

1002
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:12,660
- May I help you?

1003
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:16,244
- Yes, is this the
Cavaletti's residence?

1004
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:17,702
- Yes, it is.

1005
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:19,036
What can I do for you?

1006
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,423
- My card first, Madame.

1007
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:28,885
- Frank Huck
Delmonico NcAdeemus?

1008
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:30,214
- Yes.

1009
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:32,055
Are you Mrs. Cavaletti?

1010
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:33,556
- Yes, I am.

1011
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:35,137
- Mrs. Cavaletti

1012
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:38,519
I am a connoisseur of the rarest

1013
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:41,068
most interesting nude studies.

1014
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:42,485
- I am not interested.

1015
00:58:42,811 --> 00:58:43,811
If you'll just...

1016
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:46,857
- Ms-Cavaletti, if you
would wait just a moment

1017
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,739
and gaze upon this
exquisite artwork,

1018
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,241
I'm sure you'll be interested.

1019
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:57,330
Madame.

1020
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:00,037
I see you like my work.

1021
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,963
Miss?

1022
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:03,711
Miss Cavaletti?

1023
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:08,174
Mrs. Cavaletti?

1024
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:10,426
You do like my work?

1025
00:59:11,465 --> 00:59:13,843
I've got something
better for you.

1026
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:19,105
You'll like it.

1027
00:59:19,431 --> 00:59:22,355
Big black strong man.

1028
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:27,031
Ah. Ah.

1029
00:59:28,148 --> 00:59:30,025
You'll enjoy it.

1030
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:33,077
Miss Cavaletti, Miss Cavaletti?

1031
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:38,375
(fantasy synthesizer music)

1032
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:25,266
- Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

1033
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:28,602
(distorted sounds)

1034
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:31,609
- Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

1035
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:38,495
- Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

1036
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:43,245
- Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

1037
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:47,421
- Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

1038
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:50,624
Where, where is Cavaletti
hiding the girls!

1039
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,881
(mirrors crash)

1040
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,220
(house shakes)

1041
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:05,101
(exciting music)

1042
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:33,542
(roof collapses)

1043
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:45,930
(sparks and explosions)

1044
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:53,729
Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

1045
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:55,692
Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

1046
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:57,382
Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

1047
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,325
Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

1048
01:02:59,651 --> 01:03:01,119
Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

1049
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,196
Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

1050
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:07,083
Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

1051
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:10,913
- They're at the
house on the hill

1052
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:13,044
in Pasadena.

1053
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:15,922
They're at the house on the hill

1054
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:17,969
in Pasadena.

1055
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:21,014
They're at house on the hill

1056
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:23,091
in Pasadena!

1057
01:03:27,012 --> 01:03:28,639
- [Dolemite]
They're at the house

1058
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:31,896
on the hill in Pasadena.

1059
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:32,851
- Have a seat.

1060
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,184
- No thanks.

1061
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:35,311
- Some coffee?

1062
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:36,713
- No thanks, I've
had my breakfast.

1063
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:38,016
I just came here to find out

1064
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:39,858
what you got on
that Dolemite boy.

1065
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:41,911
It's been a while since
I've heard from you.

1066
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:44,070
I wanna know what's happening.

1067
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:46,156
- Well when we get something,

1068
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,036
I'll let you know.

1069
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:51,036
I've got my best
man on the case.

1070
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:53,667
- He ain't made no
contact with me yet.

1071
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:57,092
- Well this particular man
works better by himself.

1072
01:03:57,417 --> 01:04:00,045
He's my undercover
man for the ghettos.

1073
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:01,721
- You mean to tell me you sent

1074
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,721
a nigger out to
find another nigger?

1075
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:06,450
Why that's the most
ridiculous thing

1076
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:08,011
I've ever heard of.

1077
01:04:08,303 --> 01:04:08,974
- Sheriff.

1078
01:04:09,304 --> 01:04:11,398
We don't have any niggers here.

1079
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:13,942
Just damn fine police officers.

1080
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:15,985
Some of the best in the country.

1081
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:18,530
Now if you can't respect that,

1082
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,278
and if you can't accept
my choice of assignment,

1083
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:24,236
you can get your
ass out that door.

1084
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:26,913
And if you don't like that
you can go to the Chief.

1085
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:29,491
- I'll do just that Captain.

1086
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:32,418
And when I find him, I'll
bring his head to you.

1087
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:34,838
Since you love niggers so much.

1088
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:38,633
You can mount Dolemite's
head on your mantlepiece.

1089
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:41,381
Good day, Captain.

1090
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:45,556
- Fuck you.

1091
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:50,804
- Sweetheart.

1092
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:52,309
Call Queen.

1093
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:54,439
Tell her to bring everybody
that works for her

1094
01:04:54,516 --> 01:04:55,516
to my party tonight.

1095
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:57,007
Tell them to be ready at eight.

1096
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:59,145
I'll have them picked up.

1097
01:04:59,479 --> 01:05:01,527
(phone rings)

1098
01:05:03,191 --> 01:05:04,283
- Hello?

1099
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:06,649
- Joe wants you to scrounge
up all the girls you can

1100
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,325
and bring em over here tonight.

1101
01:05:08,655 --> 01:05:10,953
We'll send someone after you.

1102
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:13,376
- Yes ma'am, we'll be there.

1103
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:16,538
- Well.

1104
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:20,634
Looks like we've all been
invited to the party.

1105
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:22,506
But this time

1106
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:24,804
this will be the party
to end all parties.

1107
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:30,560
<i>(spooky music)</i>

1108
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:33,476
(dog barks)

1109
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:37,521
Okay.

1110
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:41,151
We know that Cavaletti has
an army compared to us.

1111
01:05:42,147 --> 01:05:43,899
We're outnumbered in people

1112
01:05:44,232 --> 01:05:46,155
but not in skill.

1113
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:49,826
Just remember

1114
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:52,123
if anybody come out alive

1115
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:54,451
be sure it be one of us.

1116
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,832
Now how did you say this worked?

1117
01:05:57,162 --> 01:05:58,414
- Well tonight

1118
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:01,090
is Cavaletti's birthday party.

1119
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:06,422
You'll have all his
big shit friends there.

1120
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:10,016
- So if we get em
all at one time,

1121
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:12,093
it's got to be tonight.

1122
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:16,101
- Has anybody heard
from Dolemite?

1123
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:20,936
(doorbell rings)

1124
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:32,246
- Howard Jackson!

1125
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:40,247
- Is that the bad little nigga
that taught me martial arts?

1126
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:42,048
- In person.

1127
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:44,046
- Lord things is looking better.

1128
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:45,375

1129
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:46,885
With that little shit?

1130
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:49,761
Well I'll take my dick and
beat his goddamn ass with that.

1131
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:51,887
(group laughs)

1132
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:54,060
- We'll see about that brother.

1133
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:58,598
- Did you hear about
the new contract?

1134
01:06:58,932 --> 01:06:59,933
- No, what is it?

1135
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,815
- It's Queen Bee,
Annie, and Dolemite.

1136
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:04,145

1137
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:05,479
- Red and Fingers.

1138
01:07:05,647 --> 01:07:06,273
- Well that's Wild.

1139
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:07,886
With those three out of the way,

1140
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:08,533
the boss will have no problems.

1141
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:09,858
- Right.

1142
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:13,822
(car honks)

1143
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:21,580
- Okay, we'll be right out.

1144
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:25,675
Alright girls.

1145
01:07:25,959 --> 01:07:28,007

the party starts

1148
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:48,027
then we'll crash it.

1149
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:54,537
(tense music)

1150
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:05,124
(fighting sounds)

1151
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:13,048
(speaks gibberish)

1152
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:18,804
(fighting sounds)

1153
01:08:23,141 --> 01:08:24,563
(Dolemite grunts)

1154
01:08:28,396 --> 01:08:31,445
(speaks gibberish)

1155
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:37,364
(exciting music)

1156
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:45,705

1167
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:55,255
- You should have stayed
down there the first time!

1168
01:10:56,544 --> 01:10:58,888
(red shirt chuckles)

1169
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:15,195
- I didn't forget about you.

1170
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:19,863
We'll make it a twosome.

1171
01:11:21,736 --> 01:11:24,114

1172
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,923
Now don't move

01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:10,596

Please don't kill us, please!

(Crack)

1188
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:42,002
- The candle over here!

1189
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:45,009
The candle, the
rope, for God's sake!

1190
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:47,511
Pull me out of the way Dolemite.

1191
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:48,432
Hurry!

1193
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:53,688

1194
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:56,061
- Oh yeah, thanks
to you Dolemite.

1195
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:01,983
- Don't touch me there's a
live grenade between my legs.

1196
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:04,065
- Be very careful
don't move, don't move.

1197
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:07,618
- He keeps the key over
in his back pocket.

(explosion)

1199
01:14:39,767 --> 01:14:42,691
- Java, are you alright?

1200
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:51,658
Mules have kicked me and
didn't even bruise my hide.

1201
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:56,417
Rattlesnakes have bit me
and falled off and died.

1202
01:14:57,827 --> 01:15:02,048
Yes, I fought my way in here

1203
01:15:03,124 --> 01:15:06,003
so girls let's go and get that

(combat sounds)

1207
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:27,072
- Hurry Dolemite.

1209
01:15:30,985 --> 01:15:34,205
(combat sounds)

1210
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:41,875
- Hello, Captain.

1211
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:43,204
Yeah, it's Pete here.

1212
01:15:43,497 --> 01:15:44,669
Yeah, I know about that.

1213
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:46,216
Listen, hold onto your hat

1214
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,222
and get a pencil and
pad to take this down.

1215
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:51,013
I got some news here to

1216
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:52,009
Yeah.

1217
01:15:52,339 --> 01:15:55,058
Look, not only do

1218
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:57,807
but the Sheriff
gets his man too.

1219
01:15:58,137 --> 01:16:00,856
That's right, Dolemite is
over at Cavaletti's right now.

1220
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:02,900
There's a war going
on between em.

1221
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:04,852
Guess who else is over there?

1222
01:16:05,186 --> 01:16:07,359
Red and Fingers, our

1223
01:16:07,688 --> 01:16:09,031
the hitmen.

Right.

1226
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,621

1228
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:20,337

1232
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:32,805
(crowd murmurs)

1233
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:37,050
- Hey Joe?

1234
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:41,306

1235
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:53,401
- Well it's about

1238
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:08,628
(crickets chirp)

1239
01:17:24,515 --> 01:17:26,893
- Say white boy, come

01:17:27,226 --> 01:17:28,648
cause tonight is the night.

1241

Come out here and you can see

1242
01:17:30,855 --> 01:17:34,576
some genuine American
Indian turquoise jewelry.

1243
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,868
I got to sell this

1244
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:38,571

I'm gonna let you take the
shit off your old lady.

1248
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:45,931
She might give you
some pussy tonight,

01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:47,459
if you know what to do with it.

1250
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:50,337
Wait a minute fool,

01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:53,340
(combat sounds)

1252

- Hey everybody.

1253
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:06,644
Got a special surprise for you.

1254
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:09,648
Cavaletti just hired a new
man, and he's one of the boys.

1255
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:12,105
And for this evening's
entertainment,

1257

1261
01:18:51,018 --> 01:18:53,612

You can take it,

01:30:24,586 --> 01:30:27,556
cause you got a one way
ticket straight to hell.

Now get in the car and move.

1372
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:31,892
- No, don't do it!

1373

Don't do it goddammit!

1374
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:34,937
- What is it Pete?

1375
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:37,982

1376
01:30:38,308 --> 01:30:40,402

Now move!

1385
01:31:26,147 --> 01:31:28,991

Where is Dolemite?

1395
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:15,617

Where is he?

1397
01:32:18,033 --> 01:32:20,127
