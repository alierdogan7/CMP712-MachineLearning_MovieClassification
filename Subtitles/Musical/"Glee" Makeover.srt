1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,015
So here's what you missed on Glee:
Kurt's in New York

2
00:00:02,016 --> 00:00:04,048
where he's rooming with Rachel
and planning to interview

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:06,504
for Vogue.com. Rachel's friend,
Brody, totally wants

4
00:00:06,505 --> 00:00:08,024
to date her, but she's still
confused about Finn,

5
00:00:08,025 --> 00:00:10,004
and Finn's still in the army,
and nobody's heard from him.

6
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:11,583
- Glee!
- Back at McKinley,

7
00:00:11,584 --> 00:00:13,315
Mr. Schue's trying to repeat
a win at nationals

8
00:00:13,316 --> 00:00:14,583
by repeating assignments from last year.

9
00:00:14,584 --> 00:00:16,538
- Are we doing Britney week again?
- That's great.

10
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:18,541
And Sam's new blonde
besties with Brittany,

11
00:00:18,542 --> 00:00:20,523
who didn't graduate and thinks
she's still president even

12
00:00:20,524 --> 00:00:22,506
though all she accomplished last year
was a dinosaur prom.

13
00:00:22,507 --> 00:00:23,558
That's what you missed on Glee.

14
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:26,499
<font color="#ff8c00">Sync & corrections by Alice</font>

15
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,498
(Tears for Fears' "Everybody
Wants to Rule the World" begins)

16
00:00:28,499 --> 00:00:29,602
BLAINE:
All right, Blaine Anderson,

17
00:00:29,603 --> 00:00:30,550
time to change things up.

18
00:00:30,551 --> 00:00:32,503
Last year, it was all

19
00:00:32,504 --> 00:00:33,558
about letting the seniors shine.

20
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:36,557
But this year...

21
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:38,571
it's your turn.

00:00:42,504 --> 00:00:45,582

Of course, part of the reason

00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,675
I'm doing all these extracurriculars

37
00:01:40,676 --> 00:01:43,553
is to fill my days
now that Kurt's in New York.

38
00:01:43,554 --> 00:01:45,548
We talk and Skype and text
as much as possible,

39
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:47,515
but the only time we're really in sync

40
00:01:47,516 --> 00:01:49,498
is when we're hate-watching
Treme together.

41
00:01:49,499 --> 00:01:50,533
These songs go on forever,

42
00:01:50,534 --> 00:01:52,516

What do you think you're doing,
Blaine Warbler?

51
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,542
I'm running for president.

52
00:02:41,538 --> 00:02:43,567
KURT: I've spent the entire
weekend trying to choose

53
00:02:43,568 --> 00:02:46,499
the absolute perfect outfit because

54
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,521
I've snagged an interview at...

55
00:02:47,522 --> 00:02:49,516
drum roll, please...

56
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:50,517
Hi, I'm Kurt Hummel.

57
00:02:50,518 --> 00:02:52,499
Vogue.com.

58
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,516
Yes, it's just for an internship,

59
00:02:54,517 --> 00:02:56,550
but I haven't been this nervous
since I auditioned for NYADA,

60
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,532
and we all know how that turned out.

61
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:01,566
I'm meeting with the new senior editor

62
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:04,532
and designer extraordinaire.
Isabelle Wright,

63
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:06,502
and her stellar reputation precedes her.

64
00:03:06,503 --> 00:03:07,548
She's a style maverick.

65
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:09,502
She double-majored
in fashion design

66
00:03:09,503 --> 00:03:10,500
and dead romance languages.

67
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:11,571
- An iconoclast.
- Rumor has it,

68
00:03:11,574 --> 00:03:14,503
She gave Steve Jobs
his first black turtleneck.

69
00:03:14,504 --> 00:03:15,550
She's Vogue's rogue.

70
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:18,504
Miss Wright will see you now.

71
00:03:20,521 --> 00:03:21,541
(knocking)

72
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:23,508
Hello?

73
00:03:24,517 --> 00:03:25,532
Columbus.

74
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:26,567
- Excuse me?
- You're from Lima.

75
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,516
I'm from Columbus.

76
00:03:28,517 --> 00:03:29,542
And actually, I once got

77
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,549
food poisoning in Lima

78
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,548
at some Italian place,

79
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:33,571
It was Bread...

80
00:03:33,572 --> 00:03:35,321
- Stix?
- Breadstix, yes.

81
00:03:35,322 --> 00:03:36,548
I can't believe you ate at Breadstix.

82
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,550
Well, I wish I hadn't.

83
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,541
Isabelle Wright.

84
00:03:39,542 --> 00:03:40,549
Kurt Hummel.

85
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,499
So, Mr. Hummel,

86
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,566
I have to tell you,
I am very impressed

87
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:45,575
with your online resume,

88
00:03:45,576 --> 00:03:49,566
especially this gallery of you

89
00:03:49,567 --> 00:03:53,503
and your rather bold
clothing choices.

90
00:03:53,504 --> 00:03:56,504
- Where did you find all this?
- Well, I.. I made most of them,

91
00:03:56,507 --> 00:03:58,507
And searched the
Internet for bargains.

92
00:03:58,508 --> 00:04:01,557
And, uh, that half-sweater there
at the bottom, that belonged

93
00:04:01,558 --> 00:04:04,516
to my dead aunt, and I
found it in her attic.

94
00:04:04,517 --> 00:04:06,499
And the embroidered calico vest

95
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,549
was actually inspired
by one of your designs.

96
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,516
Oh, yes,

97
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:13,516
my quilted micro skirt collection.

98
00:04:13,517 --> 00:04:16,499
It was an epic fail.

99
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,507
But like you said in Vanity Fair,

100
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,516
"I don't trust anyone who hasn't
failed big at least once."

101
00:04:21,517 --> 00:04:22,516
Have a seat.

102
00:04:22,517 --> 00:04:23,583
So, I'm just gonna ask you

103
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:26,566
a couple of routine questions
I ask all potential hires.

104
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:28,516
Who are your fashion icons?

105
00:04:28,517 --> 00:04:29,519
Audrey Hepburn,

106
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,542
Michelle Obama,

107
00:04:30,543 --> 00:04:32,516
and not to kiss up or anything,

108
00:04:32,517 --> 00:04:33,591
but... you.

109
00:04:33,592 --> 00:04:35,516
(chuckles)

110
00:04:35,517 --> 00:04:37,591
And have you done
any writing on fashion?

111
00:04:37,592 --> 00:04:40,532
Self journaling, mostly.

112
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:42,532
I did weekly updates

113
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:45,516
and, um, blogs on Project Runway

114
00:04:45,517 --> 00:04:46,533
since season one,

115
00:04:46,534 --> 00:04:48,054
- and...
- Wave your magic wand,

116
00:04:48,057 --> 00:04:49,574
Where would you be in four years?

117
00:04:50,575 --> 00:04:52,499
Working here part-time,

118
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,532
graduating from NYADA

119
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:56,516
and, uh,

120
00:04:56,517 --> 00:04:57,571
starting my first Broadway show.

121
00:04:57,572 --> 00:04:59,532
I know that sounds presumptuous.

122
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:00,591
No.

123
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:03,587
Frankly, you should be
more presumptuous, you know?

124
00:05:03,588 --> 00:05:06,507
This is New York;
It's for dreamers.

125
00:05:06,508 --> 00:05:08,521
It's for people like you,
who are just starting out,

126
00:05:08,522 --> 00:05:10,587
and people like me who...

127
00:05:10,588 --> 00:05:13,520
very much want
to re-invent themselves.

128
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,503
No, you should dream.
You should dream very, very big.

129
00:05:16,504 --> 00:05:17,783
And then you should work
incredibly hard

130
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:21,524
and make sure you do everything
in your power to make it happen.

131
00:05:21,525 --> 00:05:24,503
Look, Anna hired me because she said

132
00:05:24,504 --> 00:05:25,638
that the Web sites that I designed

133
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,520
for my collections were inspired.

134
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:29,524
So neither myself nor my team

135
00:05:29,525 --> 00:05:31,566
can let her down,

136
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:33,582
and that includes you.

137
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,550
- Me?
- Well, listen,

138
00:05:35,553 --> 00:05:39,549
My friend, anybody who can
pull off a hippo brooch

139
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,591
deserves to be here.

140
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:44,537
So welcome to Vogue.com.

141
00:05:44,538 --> 00:05:47,516
Thank you. Thank you so...

142
00:05:47,517 --> 00:05:48,650
- Oh, you're very welcome.
- Sorry.

143
00:05:48,653 --> 00:05:50,524
It's okay. It's okay.

144
00:05:50,525 --> 00:05:52,499
That should come with a warning.

145
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,537
Oh, it did.

146
00:05:53,538 --> 00:05:56,503
Artie, can I talk
to you for a second?

147
00:05:56,504 --> 00:05:57,756
Okay, so I'm running for senior class

148
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,550
president again, and I
want you to be my VP.

149
00:05:59,551 --> 00:06:01,537
Being vice presidential pick

150
00:06:01,538 --> 00:06:03,498
of McKinley High's
first two-term president

151
00:06:03,499 --> 00:06:04,988
would look really good
on your college resume.

152
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,537
I have a 4.0 GPA,

153
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:08,523
and I scored a 210
on my practice SAT,

154
00:06:08,524 --> 00:06:10,298
and I was the only
handi-capable member

155
00:06:10,299 --> 00:06:11,536
of a national championship glee club.

156
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,536
I'm not really worried
about getting into college.

157
00:06:13,537 --> 00:06:15,552
I know how people like you are
afraid of the spotlight sometimes,

158
00:06:15,553 --> 00:06:17,554
but did you know that Franklin
Roosevelt was part robot, too,

159
00:06:17,555 --> 00:06:20,500
- and he's on Mount Rushmore?
- No, he isn't.

160
00:06:20,503 --> 00:06:22,507
And I'm just going to say it again,

161
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:25,500
- I'm not part robot.
- I realize

162
00:06:25,501 --> 00:06:26,952
That I didn't do much
as president last year,

163
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,548
and if you help me
win again this year,

164
00:06:28,549 --> 00:06:30,550
I promise to do exactly
the same thing, which means

165
00:06:30,551 --> 00:06:33,549
I'll be president, and you can
make all the boring decisions.

166
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,587
So I could be Cheney to your Bush.

167
00:06:35,588 --> 00:06:37,407
I'd rather be landing strip.

168
00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:38,590
I mean, it's no secret that a woman

169
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,586
loves a man in power,
and don't take this personally,

170
00:06:40,587 --> 00:06:42,569
but before I graduate,
I would like to have

171
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,571
a relationship that lasts longer
than a couple weeks.

172
00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:46,507
Why would I take that personally?

173
00:06:46,508 --> 00:06:47,508
- You and I dated.
- We did?

174
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:49,566
Look, you've got yourself a deal.

175
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:52,517
- (school bell ringing)
- Cool.

176
00:06:52,518 --> 00:06:54,506
Okay, as you all know,
as national champions

177
00:06:54,507 --> 00:06:56,583
we get to host the annual Show
Choir Rules Committee meeting.

178
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:59,099
Please tell me you're gonna ask
what 1/3 vintage meant last year?

179
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,565
Or like, why some teams get
to sing six songs

180
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:01,583
and other ones only do one?

181
00:07:01,584 --> 00:07:03,532
JAKE:
Speaking of competitions,

182
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:05,498
shouldn't we start like,
preparing for ours?

183
00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:06,542
WILL:
I have some ideas

184
00:07:06,543 --> 00:07:08,583
which I am working on very hard.

185
00:07:10,554 --> 00:07:12,537
Um...

186
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:14,566
I don't really want

187
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,504
to give anything away right now...

188
00:07:16,505 --> 00:07:18,507
I have no ideas. I'm tapped out.

189
00:07:18,508 --> 00:07:20,500
I spent all last weekend
trying to think of something

190
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:22,541
for us to perform,
and all I came up with

191
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:26,507
was a scat version of "Carmina Burana."

192
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:28,500
- Yes, go ahead.
- Excuse me, I'm not sure if what

193
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:30,475
You were saying was actually
important 'cause I wasn't listening

194
00:07:30,476 --> 00:07:32,499
but I'd like to make an announcement.

195
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,502
First, I'd like to know
if anyone can prove that Blaine

196
00:07:34,503 --> 00:07:35,621
was actually born in this country.

197
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,399
Second, I'm wrapping up the election

198
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,567
by selecting Artie
as my running mate.

199
00:07:39,568 --> 00:07:40,582
Ah! All right.

200
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,516
I think by bridging

201
00:07:42,517 --> 00:07:44,516
the human-slash-robot
divide, we'll ensure

202
00:07:44,517 --> 00:07:46,554
that both students and vending
machines will be voting for us.

203
00:07:46,555 --> 00:07:48,504
- Still not a robot.
- BLAINE: Brittany, that's not fair.

204
00:07:48,505 --> 00:07:49,523
This isn't a popularity contest,

205
00:07:49,524 --> 00:07:50,681
it's about who's got the best ideas.

206
00:07:50,682 --> 00:07:52,498
It's about believing
you can make a change, right?

207
00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:53,521
ARTIE:
What is that taste

208
00:07:53,522 --> 00:07:55,516
in my...?

209
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,532
Is that sour grape?

210
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:59,508
- (school bell ringing)
- Brittany.

211
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:06,550
- Hey, butt-chin.
- Hey, Sue.

212
00:08:06,551 --> 00:08:08,523
I'm making a list of potential themes

213
00:08:08,524 --> 00:08:09,548
for our set list at sectionals,

214
00:08:09,549 --> 00:08:10,567
and right now I can't decide

215
00:08:10,568 --> 00:08:12,520
between classic TV theme songs

216
00:08:12,521 --> 00:08:13,575
or a salute to autumn.

217
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,524
William, those are terrible.

218
00:08:15,525 --> 00:08:16,665
I don't know what's wrong with me.

219
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,531
What happened to all my good ideas?

220
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:20,552
Oh, don't kid yourself; you
never had any good ideas.

221
00:08:20,553 --> 00:08:22,540
You just didn't notice
because you were too busy

222
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,531
chasing your bizarre childhood dream

223
00:08:24,532 --> 00:08:26,517
of a glee club national championship.

224
00:08:26,518 --> 00:08:29,399
And now that that's over,
well, you're waking up

225
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,523
to the incessant
mind-numbing tedium

226
00:08:30,524 --> 00:08:33,566
that is the day-to-day life
of a schoolteacher.

227
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:35,516
Take a look around you, William,

228
00:08:35,517 --> 00:08:36,567
at this sad panoply

229
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:38,499
of walking human garbage.

230
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,516
This is what you have
to look forward to.

231
00:08:40,517 --> 00:08:41,533
In a few short years,

232
00:08:41,534 --> 00:08:44,553
you'll either be an alcoholic...

233
00:08:44,554 --> 00:08:46,574
morbidly obese...

234
00:08:46,575 --> 00:08:49,553
or both.

235
00:08:49,554 --> 00:08:52,516
That's what I like to call
the Full Charlotte Rae.

236
00:08:52,517 --> 00:08:54,500
Personally, William,
I think you should take

237
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,507
this opportunity to
bow out gracefully

238
00:08:56,508 --> 00:08:58,532
and explore other job opportunities.

239
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:01,516
Now, your penchant for
bland, simplistic aphorisms

240
00:09:01,517 --> 00:09:02,548
could give you a leg up

241
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:04,171
in the motivational hot-air
balloon poster business,

242
00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:05,499
and of course,

243
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,673
your complete lack of adult friends

244
00:09:06,674 --> 00:09:08,567
means you're well on
your way to a career

245
00:09:08,568 --> 00:09:10,499
as a pedophile birthday clown.

246
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,499
But I love my job.

247
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,566
William, you had a dream,

248
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:15,575
and you achieved it.

249
00:09:15,576 --> 00:09:17,499
Now move on.

250
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,570
Otherwise, you'll end up like that.

251
00:09:19,571 --> 00:09:21,567
Quietly smirking because you just did

252
00:09:21,568 --> 00:09:23,537
a little crop-dusting.

253
00:09:23,538 --> 00:09:25,592
Oh, and now you're enjoying the
sneaky tickle of your own stink

254
00:09:25,593 --> 00:09:28,532
as it ripples up your
enormous, soupy butt crack.

255
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:30,570
(school bell ringing)

256
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,519
Hey, why didn't you ask me
to be your running mate?

257
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,558
I'm like the perfect candidate.

258
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:35,499
Well, I didn't want it

259
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,571
to ruin our friendship.

260
00:09:36,572 --> 00:09:38,516
I mean, look at Sarah Palin.

261
00:09:38,517 --> 00:09:39,965
She and her grandfather,
they were super close,

262
00:09:39,966 --> 00:09:41,558
and then he asked her
to be his running mate,

263
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:44,549
and they lost, and now
they're not even speaking.

264
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,517
But I do think you'd be
a great vice president,

265
00:09:46,518 --> 00:09:48,574
so I'm going to help you out.

266
00:09:48,575 --> 00:09:50,574
Come here.
Blaine Warbler?

267
00:09:50,575 --> 00:09:52,591
I'd like to introduce you
to Sam Evans.

268
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:56,557
Um, we've actually met several times.

269
00:09:56,558 --> 00:09:58,517
He's your candidate
for vice president.

270
00:09:58,518 --> 00:10:00,517
Uh, no. I'm picking
my own running mate.

271
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:02,557
My family's on food stamps,
so that will

272
00:10:02,558 --> 00:10:04,498
get you the sympathy vote.
I'm not gay,

273
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:05,665
so that'll help
with the not-gay vote,

274
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,536
and you know,
I don't want to brag, but...

275
00:10:07,537 --> 00:10:09,283
(imitates George W. Bush):
My impressions are hilarious

276
00:10:09,284 --> 00:10:10,504
100% of the time.

277
00:10:11,504 --> 00:10:12,517
It's George Bush, come on.

278
00:10:12,518 --> 00:10:13,570
Okay, sure.

279
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,516
Awesome.

280
00:10:15,517 --> 00:10:16,538
First order of business,

281
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:19,499
Artie and I challenge you
and Sam to a debate.

282
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,570
You're on.

283
00:10:20,571 --> 00:10:22,575
(whispering):
What's a debate?

284
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,521
I think it's time
we tackled something

285
00:10:27,522 --> 00:10:29,532
that we have been avoiding
for far too long,

286
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:31,499
and I think you all know

287
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,516
exactly

288
00:10:32,517 --> 00:10:33,558
what I'm talking about.

289
00:10:40,017 --> 00:10:42,007
Leather...

290
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:45,007
Leather, but in unexpected ways.

291
00:10:45,008 --> 00:10:46,074
Pitch me.

292
00:10:46,075 --> 00:10:48,024
Okay, it's coming to me.

293
00:10:48,025 --> 00:10:50,082
It's coming to me. It's Italy.

294
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,999
Saló, 1944.

295
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,023
Belts as punishment.

296
00:10:53,024 --> 00:10:54,065
Belts as reward.

297
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:56,025
"You can't have a belt!
You: put a belt on!"

298
00:10:56,026 --> 00:10:57,903
It's faux-fascist.

299
00:10:57,904 --> 00:10:59,048
It's... pair it with a chunky
boot.

300
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:00,075
Okay, belts were two years ago,

301
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,016
and chunky boots were five years ago.

302
00:11:03,017 --> 00:11:05,074
While we're on the topic
of the verboten,

303
00:11:05,075 --> 00:11:08,041
I would beg all of you
to please, please

304
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,016
not offer up a leather platform.

305
00:11:10,017 --> 00:11:13,037
Chase, you know I love you,
and I... and I love

306
00:11:13,038 --> 00:11:15,041
that you're filled
with so much passion,

307
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:17,036
so I'm definite...
I'm going to...

308
00:11:17,037 --> 00:11:19,017
I'll keep thinking
about it, of course.

309
00:11:19,018 --> 00:11:20,057
Okay.

310
00:11:20,058 --> 00:11:22,020
Um... Daphne.

311
00:11:22,021 --> 00:11:24,016
Leather socks.

312
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,092
Suede underpants.

313
00:11:25,093 --> 00:11:28,074
Cowhide brassieres.

314
00:11:28,075 --> 00:11:30,058
Daphne, did you go
off your meds again?

315
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:31,066
Yes.

316
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:33,082
Then I want you to stay off

317
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,766
because that... is sick.

318
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:37,591
I mean good sick.
That's the...

319
00:11:37,592 --> 00:11:40,199
that's the kind of sick
I want you to be.

320
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,081
You know, that's exactly what
I'm talking about, everybody.

321
00:11:42,082 --> 00:11:43,567
I don't want any rules...
just toss them.

322
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:45,583
You know, let's think out of the box.

323
00:11:47,517 --> 00:11:48,590
Or... maybe... I don't know.

324
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:50,583
Maybe that's... maybe that's
too far out of the box.

325
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,516
Okay, why don't we do this?

326
00:11:52,517 --> 00:11:53,531
Let's, uh... we'll...

327
00:11:53,532 --> 00:11:54,783
we're going to take a...
a little break,

328
00:11:54,784 --> 00:11:56,582
and then we will...

329
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,553
we'll revisit the topic
of leather, okay?

330
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:01,592
Kurt, can I... can I see you
in my office?

331
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:07,499
So, what did you think
of the ideas in there?

332
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,592
Fascinating.

333
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,520
I hated them.

334
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:13,556
Look, I-I know I'm
just an intern,

335
00:12:13,557 --> 00:12:15,550
but I feel like "unexpected leather"

336
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:18,499
should be in the back pages
of The Village Voice.

337
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,541
No, I know, I agree, but Mand...

338
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,021
Mandy, you know, the receptionist,

339
00:12:24,022 --> 00:12:26,507
every time I walk
by her, she suggests

340
00:12:26,508 --> 00:12:29,082
that I do an article on
trends in animal hide.

341
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:32,499
And then her cat died.
Did you know her cat died?

342
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,516
So, what, am I going to say no?

343
00:12:34,517 --> 00:12:37,500
- So now I'm stuck with leather.
- No, you're not.

344
00:12:37,501 --> 00:12:38,658
There are a million different ideas.

345
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:41,541
Uh, we could do a music
video that pays tribute

346
00:12:41,542 --> 00:12:43,541
to the most cutting-edge
fashion, right?

347
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:46,582
Well, I told Chase Madison
that I would do his piece

348
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:50,524
on Spanx for cankles:
"Spankles."

349
00:12:50,525 --> 00:12:53,532
Oh, God. I'm an artist,
not a manager.

350
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:56,503
I... I can't say no to anybody.
I can't bear it.

351
00:12:56,504 --> 00:12:58,503
You know, I'm...
I'm used to knocking on doors,

352
00:12:58,504 --> 00:12:59,538
not bolting them shut.

353
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:03,499
Back in the day, if I had
an idea... a crazy idea...

354
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,570
I knew if it was good
based on my instinct.

355
00:13:05,571 --> 00:13:09,532
And now crazy ideas
just seem crazy to me.

356
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:13,553
You know, like, uh, uh...
uh, high-heeled galoshes or, um,

357
00:13:13,554 --> 00:13:15,553
equestrian underwear... what?

358
00:13:15,554 --> 00:13:20,549
And I can't...
I can't land anything.

359
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,532
I just feel like I lucked

360
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:25,516
into a job
that I don't deserve, and I...

361
00:13:25,517 --> 00:13:27,532
honestly, I-I-I...
I have no idea

362
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:28,583
what I'm doing.

363
00:13:28,584 --> 00:13:30,516
My collection was a failure.

364
00:13:30,517 --> 00:13:31,523
I can't fail at this.

365
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:33,406
And I just rented
a one-bedroom apartment

366
00:13:33,407 --> 00:13:34,573
in Midtown so I could walk to work.

367
00:13:34,574 --> 00:13:36,567
But now I'm not going to have
a job to walk to

368
00:13:36,568 --> 00:13:38,499
or an apartment to walk from.

369
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,533
I'm going to be homeless.

370
00:13:39,534 --> 00:13:40,549
Hey, hey.

371
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,507
You are not going to be homeless.

372
00:13:43,508 --> 00:13:45,516
All right? You can
always come stay

373
00:13:45,517 --> 00:13:47,508
with me and my roommate in Bushwick.

374
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:49,532
Oh, God.

375
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:51,507
Brittany, I just got a copy

376
00:13:51,508 --> 00:13:53,507
of Jacob Ben Israel's
latest presidential poll.

377
00:13:53,508 --> 00:13:55,591
The good news is 90%
of respondents said

378
00:13:55,592 --> 00:13:57,523
they're planning
on attending Friday's debate.

379
00:13:57,524 --> 00:13:59,506
That's cool.
So what's the bad news?

380
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:01,542
90% of those respondents said
they were coming to hear you...

381
00:14:01,543 --> 00:14:05,553
say something
st... stu...

382
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:07,517
They think I'm going to say
something stupid.

383
00:14:07,518 --> 00:14:09,532
But, see, you're not stupid.

384
00:14:09,533 --> 00:14:11,507
You're really creative.

385
00:14:11,508 --> 00:14:13,083
Your brain exists in this
magical other dimension

386
00:14:13,084 --> 00:14:14,532
where anything is possible.

387
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:16,503
It's really amazing.

388
00:14:16,504 --> 00:14:18,553
We just need to focus on
a little preparation.

389
00:14:18,554 --> 00:14:20,519
If I'm going to be completely honest,

390
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,788
I'm a little worried
that my picking you

391
00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:24,532
as a running mate is going to
seem like a desperate grab

392
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:26,523
for the straight vote
if you don't really look

393
00:14:26,524 --> 00:14:28,498
like a serious candidate, you know?

394
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:30,083
(imitates John Wayne):
What do you mean, pilgrim?

395
00:14:30,084 --> 00:14:31,517
- Was that John Wayne?
- Yeah. I panicked.

396
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,541
Okay, listen.

397
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:34,499
When's your next free period?

398
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,520
I need you to meet me
in the costume shop.

399
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:38,582
Brittany S. Pierce,
how do you react

400
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,503
to the characterization of
your first term in office

401
00:14:41,504 --> 00:14:44,499
as one in which you didn't do
anything at all until prom?

402
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,549
I would describe that
as entirely accurate.

403
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,499
Okay.

404
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,721
Test scores at McKinley
have gone down

405
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,524
six percent every year
for the past decade.

406
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:53,517
- What would you do to fix the problem?
- Stop giving tests.

407
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:54,988
They're hard, and there's
way too many of them.

408
00:14:54,989 --> 00:14:56,524
What is your favorite color?

409
00:14:56,525 --> 00:14:57,582
Filipino.

410
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,520
They're very hard workers,

411
00:14:59,521 --> 00:15:01,524
and family is very important to them.

412
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,675
You know what?
Let's talk wardrobe.

413
00:15:02,676 --> 00:15:04,570

Okay.

444
00:16:43,571 --> 00:16:45,532
First off, I'd just like to say

445
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:47,532
what an honor it is
to have been asked to lead

446
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:49,425
the annual
Show Choir Committee meeting.

447
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:51,542
- Which of these snacks are gluten free?
- I guess the carrots are.

448
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:52,573
Did it state so on the package?

449
00:16:52,574 --> 00:16:54,531
Because you do not want
to deal with me

450
00:16:54,532 --> 00:16:56,192
- if I've got gluten in my system.
- We really need

451
00:16:56,195 --> 00:16:57,583
- to get started, Mr. Rumba.
- What?

452
00:16:57,586 --> 00:16:59,554
- We really need to get started.
- Well, why didn't you say so?

453
00:16:59,557 --> 00:17:01,516
I did... several times.

454
00:17:01,517 --> 00:17:02,565
Well, I didn't hear you.

455
00:17:02,566 --> 00:17:04,521
You know I have complete
loss of hearing

456
00:17:04,522 --> 00:17:06,521
- in my left ear... scarlet fever.
- Uh, Birdie,

457
00:17:06,522 --> 00:17:07,738
You had mentioned you
wanted to discuss

458
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:09,549
some of the redistricting bylaws.

459
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,582
I've been doing some research,
and it turns out...

460
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,524
- in Article 12...
WILL: I'm so bored.

461
00:17:14,525 --> 00:17:15,588
What is wrong with me?

462
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:17,524
This is what I've always wanted.

463
00:17:17,525 --> 00:17:18,590
I won Nationals.

464
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,538
I'm... I'm in charge of this committee.

465
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,507
But it feels so meaningless.

466
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:23,771
Do all teachers feel this at some point?

467
00:17:23,772 --> 00:17:26,499
When Regionals occur
in a leap year...

468
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,558
Oh, this is pointless!

469
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:29,499
I didn't know how

470
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,550
to tell you guys...

471
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:33,525
- but my glee club lost its funding.
- Oh, my God.

472
00:17:33,526 --> 00:17:35,519
We're done. We can't even
complete the season.

473
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,556
I know that everybody likes
to make fun of the deaf choir,

474
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,567
but my kids have a song
in their heart; they're not

475
00:17:39,568 --> 00:17:41,899
going to be able to sing it.
For some of them,

476
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,536
it's the only thing that brings
them any happiness.

477
00:17:43,537 --> 00:17:44,671
It's the only thing that brings me

478
00:17:44,672 --> 00:17:46,587
any happiness
besides my extreme couponing

479
00:17:46,588 --> 00:17:48,566
and muscle relaxers.

480
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,499
I'm so sorry.

481
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,738
- Is there anything we can do?
- Yeah.

482
00:17:51,741 --> 00:17:53,549
You can watch your back,
because you're next.

483
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,524
We're all dead.

484
00:17:55,525 --> 00:17:57,524
The money for the arts has dried up.

485
00:17:57,525 --> 00:17:59,507
What we need is representation

486
00:17:59,508 --> 00:18:01,524
on that blue-ribbon
government panel to get arts

487
00:18:01,525 --> 00:18:02,542
back in the schools.

488
00:18:02,543 --> 00:18:03,958
There was a huge debate
over that in Congress.

489
00:18:03,961 --> 00:18:05,582
Oh, they don't care about us.

490
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,548
They don't want
to have anything to do

491
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:09,525
with show choir directors;
They want bigwigs

492
00:18:09,526 --> 00:18:11,532
like Meryl Streep or Demi Lovato.

493
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:12,781
Maybe they'll take
a show choir director

494
00:18:12,782 --> 00:18:14,523
who just won Nationals
and wants to make

495
00:18:14,524 --> 00:18:15,558
a difference in this world.

496
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:18,517
- Go for it.
- RUMBA: Highly unlikely.

497
00:18:18,518 --> 00:18:20,515
I'm going to have a shame Triscuit.

498
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,575
I don't care if I have to spend

499
00:18:21,576 --> 00:18:23,537
all night on the potty.

500
00:18:23,538 --> 00:18:25,516
RACHEL:
Yeah, I swear it.

501
00:18:25,517 --> 00:18:27,098
It was like a deleted
scene from The Exorcist

502
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:28,583
that was cut because it
was actually too scary.

503
00:18:28,584 --> 00:18:30,567
- Oh, chilling.
- And then I tried...

504
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,574
I tried to be, like,
nice and, you know, smile,

505
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,525
but then the black swans said to me...

506
00:18:34,526 --> 00:18:36,553
I didn't know Lena Dunham
was joining us today.

507
00:18:36,554 --> 00:18:39,532
I'm sorry, but did I do
something to offend you?

508
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:40,536
Your outfit did.

509
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:42,515
It's at least a decade away from even

510
00:18:42,516 --> 00:18:43,567
being considered
for ironic-retro.

511
00:18:43,568 --> 00:18:45,499
It's a tragedy What Not to Wear

512
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,558
doesn't do
two-hour specials.

513
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,516
(girls giggling)

514
00:18:48,517 --> 00:18:50,506
You know, part of why
I was so excited

515
00:18:50,507 --> 00:18:51,523
to come to New York was because

516
00:18:51,524 --> 00:18:52,588
I thought it would be a chance

517
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,586
for me to start over,
reinvent myself.

518
00:18:54,587 --> 00:18:56,525
I had no idea that it was going to be

519
00:18:56,526 --> 00:18:58,507
so exactly the same.

520
00:18:58,508 --> 00:18:59,708
You know why you
feel exactly the same?

521
00:18:59,709 --> 00:19:00,508
Hmm?

522
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:01,988
Because you're still
dressing exactly the same.

523
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:04,532
We're not in Ohio any more, Rachel.

524
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:06,582
And even then,
it's not like we were on trend.

525
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:10,516
I hate to say this, but
life is like high school.

526
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:12,516
Styles and clothes determine
the pecking order.

527
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:14,553
Well, I don't know
what you expect me to do.

528
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:16,540
It's not like I can afford
an entire new wardrobe.

529
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,508
Who says you'll have to pay for it?

530
00:19:20,042 --> 00:19:22,033
Put down your chopsticks
and follow me.

531
00:19:22,034 --> 00:19:23,507
I got an idea.

532
00:19:23,508 --> 00:19:24,517
It's almost midnight.

533
00:19:24,518 --> 00:19:26,507
What are you talking about?

534
00:19:27,008 --> 00:19:29,066
I'm about to change your life.

535
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,083
And maybe mine, too.

536
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,524
Oh, my God, this is crazy.

537
00:19:37,525 --> 00:19:39,267
- Take a picture of me.
- Come on, quick, quick, quick.

538
00:19:39,568 --> 00:19:40,592
Check this out.

539
00:19:40,593 --> 00:19:42,582
This is unbelievable.

540
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:45,517
Wait, I'm scared.
Don't leave me.

541
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,938
RACHEL:
Oh, my God.

542
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,587
I can't even breathe.

543
00:19:55,588 --> 00:19:57,549
They call this the Couture Vault.

544
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,587
It supposedly
can withstand a nuclear blast.

545
00:19:59,588 --> 00:20:01,570
Okay, I'll set up the camera.

546
00:20:01,571 --> 00:20:04,499
ISABELLE:
Freeze!

547
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,529
Kurt.

548
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:06,758
Oh, uh... I thought
you were going to be

549
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:08,552
At dinner with Steve Buscemi
and Yoko Ono.

550
00:20:08,553 --> 00:20:09,565
Well, they canceled again.

551
00:20:09,566 --> 00:20:11,556
What are you doing here?
And who is that?

552
00:20:11,557 --> 00:20:13,098
I'm Rachel Berry...
I'm Kurt's roommate. He...

553
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:14,750
We were going to do
a music video for the Web site.

554
00:20:14,751 --> 00:20:16,508
- He adores you.
- Rachel was going to get a makeover,

555
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,566
And she was going to model
some clothes.

556
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:20,516
Stop, stop.
Stop, stop, stop.

557
00:20:20,517 --> 00:20:21,567
You had me at "makeover."

- No, it's genius.

601
00:22:48,522 --> 00:22:49,583
And Rachel looks so gorgeous,

602
00:22:49,584 --> 00:22:52,566
the whole looks so...
like, professional,

603
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:55,524
like a real fashion video that
you'd seen on TV or something.

604
00:22:55,525 --> 00:22:56,588
So what's the next step?

605
00:22:56,589 --> 00:22:58,582
KURT:
Well, uh, ideally

606
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:00,571
the dream would be that
Isabelle would see it,

607
00:23:00,572 --> 00:23:03,399
and love it, and then
put it on Vogue.com.

608
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,569
But I mean, she's already committed
to so many other concepts that...

609
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,848
No, Kurt, of course she's going to
choose yours. She's gonna pick yours.

610
00:23:07,849 --> 00:23:09,533
KURT: And then, after
we made over Rachel,

611
00:23:09,534 --> 00:23:12,399
Isabelle took us to this place
called Gray's Papaya

612
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,592
and we had guava juice and hot dogs.

613
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:15,554
- BLAINE: Wow.
- It was amazing.

614
00:23:15,557 --> 00:23:18,549
You're hanging out with fashion
goddess Isabelle Wright.

615
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,883
And I'm running for
Student Body President

616
00:23:19,884 --> 00:23:21,549
with a former stripper.

617
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,531
Oh my gosh, I forgot about that!
How's it going?

618
00:23:23,532 --> 00:23:24,588
It's going okay.

619
00:23:24,589 --> 00:23:26,591
But, um, I did want to
ask you what bow tie

620
00:23:26,592 --> 00:23:28,569
you thought I should wear
for tomorrow's debate.

621
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,571
I have narrowed it down to five,
but mainly I have...

622
00:23:30,572 --> 00:23:32,132
Bow ties are your signature,

623
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:33,588
whatever you choose is
gonna look great on you.

624
00:23:33,589 --> 00:23:35,533
- RACHEL: Hi, Blaine, we miss you!
- Oh, Rachel says hi.

625
00:23:35,534 --> 00:23:36,565
Oh, hi, Rachel.

626
00:23:36,566 --> 00:23:38,515
By the way, one more question
about the video.

627
00:23:38,516 --> 00:23:40,548
That scene where she plays
the East Village It Girl...

628
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:41,588
did you think that was too much?

629
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:43,587
No, it's... I don't know.

630
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,554
Oh, good, good, good. 'Cause I
didn't either, but she was

631
00:23:45,555 --> 00:23:47,537
a little skeptical.

632
00:23:47,538 --> 00:23:49,154
But I said she was very
Chloe Sevigny chic, right?

633
00:23:49,155 --> 00:23:50,521
- Yeah? Good.
- Yeah. Yeah.

634
00:23:50,522 --> 00:23:52,558
And then, oh my God, I found
this sweater in the vault

635
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,500
that was to die for!

636
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,533
- (school bell ringing)
- Hi.

637
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,574
Hi.

638
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,558
I know I don't have an
appointment, but, uh...

639
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:08,507
I really needed to speak to
my guidance counselor,

640
00:24:08,508 --> 00:24:10,532
and not my fiancée.

641
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,587
Well, please have
a seat, Mr. Schuester.

642
00:24:12,588 --> 00:24:14,532
Mr. Schuester.
(laughs)

643
00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:16,520
As you know,

644
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,532
all I've ever wanted
was to make a difference.

645
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:21,537
Change people's lives.
Make them better.

646
00:24:21,538 --> 00:24:23,275
I'd like to think that
I've done that in my time here.

647
00:24:23,276 --> 00:24:25,517
- Mm-hmm.
- Winning Nationals,

648
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,549
Seeing most of the kids graduate.

649
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,069
Right, you have a lot
to be proud of here.

650
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,588
(Sighs)

651
00:24:30,591 --> 00:24:33,587
But now I have this once in a
lifetime opportunity in front of me.

652
00:24:33,588 --> 00:24:35,190
A chance to make a difference
on a whole new level.

653
00:24:35,191 --> 00:24:36,592
Okay.

654
00:24:36,595 --> 00:24:39,566
So they're... they're assembling
a blue-ribbon panel

655
00:24:39,567 --> 00:24:41,533
to improve arts education
around the country.

656
00:24:41,534 --> 00:24:43,532
I filled out the application,

657
00:24:43,533 --> 00:24:45,549
but I haven't sent it in yet.

658
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,592
This looks amazing.

659
00:24:46,593 --> 00:24:48,566
If I were to get this...

660
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:51,516
I would have to leave
McKinley for several months.

661
00:24:51,517 --> 00:24:52,571
Paid for by the District,

662
00:24:52,572 --> 00:24:56,570
but I'd be away from the kids.

663
00:24:56,571 --> 00:25:00,499
Oh. Um... Okay.

664
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,537
I... You know we've been telling
these kids for years

665
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:05,574
to follow their dreams
no matter what, so...

666
00:25:05,575 --> 00:25:07,532
Yeah.

667
00:25:07,533 --> 00:25:10,532
I'm not going to tell you
to do the opposite.

668
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:13,582
I just don't want to do
anything to jeopardize...

669
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:16,566
this-this new life
we're about to begin together.

670
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:19,499
It's not gonna change a thing.

671
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,553
Okay? Weddings can wait.

672
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:24,582
You have to apply for this position.

673
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:26,575
And if you get it,
we will cross that bridge

674
00:25:26,576 --> 00:25:28,516
when we come to it.

675
00:25:28,517 --> 00:25:29,550
Together.

676
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,550
(patriotic music plays)

677
00:25:39,551 --> 00:25:41,549
(scattered whistles, cheers)

678
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:44,541
Attention, miniscule segment
of the student body.

679
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:45,667
Principal Figgins is out this week,

680
00:25:45,668 --> 00:25:48,537
with what he describes as
religious fever.

681
00:25:48,538 --> 00:25:50,573
SUE (distant): And I am forced
to moderate these proceedings.

682
00:25:50,574 --> 00:25:52,523
Hey, dude, uh,
now that you made me over,

683
00:25:52,524 --> 00:25:53,888
- can I give you some advice?
- Yeah, sure.

684
00:25:53,891 --> 00:25:55,575
- Lose the bow tie.
- What?

685
00:25:55,576 --> 00:25:57,531
Yeah, trust me,
it makes you look uptight

686
00:25:57,532 --> 00:25:58,988
and a little like a young
Orville Redenbacher.

687
00:25:58,989 --> 00:26:00,553
Just... take it off.

688
00:26:00,554 --> 00:26:02,532
Okay.

689
00:26:02,533 --> 00:26:03,553
You know what?

690
00:26:03,554 --> 00:26:05,587
Actually, it's...
you're actually right.

691
00:26:05,588 --> 00:26:07,069
Thank you.

692
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,550
SUE: There are two new
utterly disheartening

693
00:26:08,553 --> 00:26:11,549
wrinkles to this year's
absolutely pointless contest.

694
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:14,532
First, the horrifying fact that
this year's slate of candidates

695
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:17,549
consists entirely
of Glee Club members.

696
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:20,537
And secondly,
the inexplicable introduction

697
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:21,552
of a vice presidential field

698
00:26:21,553 --> 00:26:23,540
for no discernable reason whatsoever.

699
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:24,592
Separation of powers!

700
00:26:24,593 --> 00:26:26,570
Whoo!

701
00:26:26,571 --> 00:26:28,591
So let's meet these
second-tiered losers.

702
00:26:28,592 --> 00:26:30,575
You know them as
the pimp and the gimp.

703
00:26:30,576 --> 00:26:33,549
Artie Abrams and Sam Evans.

704
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,517
(scattered applause)

705
00:26:42,575 --> 00:26:45,549
SUE: Stumbles, my first
question is for you.

706
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,548
Who, in God's name,
gives a hot, wet, steamy dump

707
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:48,583
about student government?

708
00:26:48,584 --> 00:26:50,550
- (mic feedback screeches)
- I do.

709
00:26:50,551 --> 00:26:52,525
And I think everyone
in this room should, too.

710
00:26:52,526 --> 00:26:55,582
First of all, student government
isn't just a way for us to pad

711
00:26:55,583 --> 00:26:58,203
our college résumés.
It's a way for us

712
00:26:58,204 --> 00:26:59,554
to take an active role
in our own education.

713
00:26:59,555 --> 00:27:01,516
Study after study shows

714
00:27:01,517 --> 00:27:02,533
that an active student body

715
00:27:02,534 --> 00:27:04,516
is a successful student body.

716
00:27:04,517 --> 00:27:05,540
Okay, moving on.

717
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,398
Student government
is just the beginning.

718
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:08,531
We need more
after-school programs,

719
00:27:08,532 --> 00:27:09,665
and better-qualified staff
to support

720
00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:11,533
our teachers, who are
overworked and underpaid.

721
00:27:11,534 --> 00:27:13,533
- Oh, dear God.
- And that's just the beginning.

722
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,541
I want to talk about the
cafeteria, 'cause I believe...

723
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:19,332
at the beginning of every
year to see if...

724
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:20,573
enough to support
our brain activity...

725
00:27:20,574 --> 00:27:22,552
That's one of the many goals
I promise to reach

726
00:27:22,553 --> 00:27:24,538
by the midway point of my first term,

727
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:25,903
as outlined in my 96-point

728
00:27:25,904 --> 00:27:27,583
Pierce-Abrams Road map
To Restore McKinley's Future.

729
00:27:27,584 --> 00:27:30,516
Merciful sweet Jesus, thank you.

730
00:27:30,517 --> 00:27:32,549
Sam Evans, your response?

731
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,537
I wasn't really listening.

732
00:27:34,538 --> 00:27:36,537
Whatever Artie said,
I agree with that.

733
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:38,582
SUE: Our next question
is from the Twitter.

734
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:42,537
@HungrySouthMouth asks Sam Evans,

735
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:44,533
"Rumor has it you were a
stripper. Aren't you ashamed?"

736
00:27:44,534 --> 00:27:46,533
(sighs)

737
00:27:47,567 --> 00:27:49,533
No, I'm not.

738
00:27:51,517 --> 00:27:52,550
(electronic beat begins)

739
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:54,504
In fact...

740
00:27:56,583 --> 00:27:58,542
- GIRL: Whoo...
- ♪ Shake that ♪

741
00:27:58,543 --> 00:27:59,592
(audience whooping)

742
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,550
(whooping)

743
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,550
Students at this school
have every right to be angry.

744
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:11,520
Last year's student council,
led by my opponent,

745
00:28:11,521 --> 00:28:13,524
was the most ineffectual
in a generation.

746
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,521
Brittany S. Pierce,
in her last term,

747
00:28:15,522 --> 00:28:17,520
accomplished absolutely nothing,

748
00:28:17,521 --> 00:28:18,583
except plan
a dinosaur-themed prom

749
00:28:18,584 --> 00:28:20,582
and ban the use

750
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:22,508
- of hair gel.
- (Audience member whoops)

751
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:23,592
Ladies and gentlemen,

752
00:28:23,593 --> 00:28:26,557
telling anyone what
they can or cannot

753
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:29,549
put into their hair is disgusting.

754
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,524
It's the first step
towards tyranny, my friends.

755
00:28:32,525 --> 00:28:34,567
Next thing you know,
they'll start burning books.

756
00:28:34,568 --> 00:28:37,557
And then they'll probably
start burning people, too.

757
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:39,587
That's a lie.

758
00:28:39,588 --> 00:28:41,567
This tyranny all
ends today, McKinley.

759
00:28:41,568 --> 00:28:44,520
I want to offer you a change.

760
00:28:44,521 --> 00:28:45,583
And I am that change.

761
00:28:45,584 --> 00:28:48,499
Let's make history, Titans.

762
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,520
And vote Anderson-Evans.

763
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:51,533
Thank you.

764
00:28:53,533 --> 00:28:55,499
Sweet, simple Brittany.

765
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,541
What say you?

766
00:28:56,542 --> 00:28:59,533
Uh...

767
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:02,554
I love you.

768
00:29:04,517 --> 00:29:07,532
I love you so much,
McKinley High School.

769
00:29:07,533 --> 00:29:09,567
Simple as that.
In fact...

770
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:13,533
I think that everyone

771
00:29:13,534 --> 00:29:16,532
should love this school
as much as I do.

772
00:29:16,533 --> 00:29:18,549
If you elect me as president,

773
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,533
I promise to outlaw summer vacation,

774
00:29:20,534 --> 00:29:23,532
so we'll have school all year round.

775
00:29:23,533 --> 00:29:25,507
That means we'll spend every day

776
00:29:25,508 --> 00:29:29,516
of every summer indoors
with all our friends,

777
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,571
in McKinley High School's
award-winning air conditioning.

778
00:29:31,572 --> 00:29:34,541
Also, I promise to end

779
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:36,588
McKinley High School's
policy of having weekends.

780
00:29:36,589 --> 00:29:39,532
If you make me your president,

781
00:29:39,533 --> 00:29:41,508
Saturday and Sunday will be illegal,

782
00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:43,549
so that Monday will
come right after Friday,

783
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,532
which is the funnest day anyways.

784
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,571
Vote Brittany and Artie.
Thank you so much.

785
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:52,533
- (applauding)
- We just lost the election.

786
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,583
Kurt, can I see you for a minute?

787
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:01,571
You might want to sit down for this.

788
00:30:04,567 --> 00:30:06,566
I saw your video,

789
00:30:06,567 --> 00:30:08,557
and I forwarded it to Anna.

790
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:11,550
Am I fired?

791
00:30:16,571 --> 00:30:18,574
ISABELLE:
That is the first time

792
00:30:18,575 --> 00:30:20,498
that I've heard "great" from Anna.

793
00:30:20,499 --> 00:30:21,654
I am gonna print that and frame it.

794
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:23,116
Does... does this mean

795
00:30:23,117 --> 00:30:24,525
they're gonna put the
video on the Web site?

796
00:30:24,526 --> 00:30:25,533
Sort of.

797
00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:26,806
We're gonna reshoot the whole thing

798
00:30:26,807 --> 00:30:28,575
in Bali with Karolína Kurková,
but you're getting credit

799
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,550
- for the idea.
- Oh, my...

800
00:30:30,553 --> 00:30:33,499
Oh, thank you, thank you so much.

801
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,013
Thank you.

802
00:30:34,014 --> 00:30:35,625
And thank you so much for
helping out with Rachel.

803
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:36,552
She went home that night

804
00:30:36,553 --> 00:30:37,754
and threw away her reindeer sweater,

805
00:30:37,755 --> 00:30:39,557
which is a huge deal for her.

806
00:30:39,558 --> 00:30:41,571
Ah, she already seems so much
more confident, you know?

807
00:30:41,572 --> 00:30:43,587
It's so funny how

808
00:30:43,588 --> 00:30:45,583
a new image can change everything.

809
00:30:46,084 --> 00:30:47,087
Oh...

810
00:30:47,088 --> 00:30:50,032
I sure hope you never lose that.

811
00:30:50,033 --> 00:30:51,087
What?

812
00:30:51,088 --> 00:30:53,049
Oh, just your...

813
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:57,024
unbridled, wide-eyed,
Lima, Ohio optimism.

814
00:30:57,025 --> 00:30:59,088
You know, I had an instinct
about you, Kurt Hummel,

815
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:02,049
and so far,
it's proven to be correct.

816
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:04,088
I feel like we're real
kindred spirits, don't you?

817
00:31:04,089 --> 00:31:05,999
I agree.

818
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,049
Can I please just say that

819
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:10,074
I think you're the best-dressed
fairy godmother

820
00:31:10,075 --> 00:31:13,053
an intern like me could ever have?

821
00:31:13,054 --> 00:31:15,015
Well, then, can your fairy godmother

822
00:31:15,016 --> 00:31:16,075
give you a little bit of advice?

823
00:31:16,076 --> 00:31:19,082
You have quite the
aptitude for fashion.

824
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:22,032
And I know it's your
dream to go to NYADA,

825
00:31:22,033 --> 00:31:24,016
but sometimes dreams can change,

826
00:31:24,017 --> 00:31:26,057
and I really would not
be surprised if someday,

827
00:31:26,058 --> 00:31:28,003
every A-lister in this town

828
00:31:28,004 --> 00:31:30,000
was fighting for one of your designs.

829
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:33,021
So which "leather" pitch
are we running with?

830
00:31:33,022 --> 00:31:34,999
Oh, actually, you know what?

831
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,065
We're gonna toss the whole thing
and start from scratch.

832
00:31:37,066 --> 00:31:39,000
We're gonna meet here in two hours.

833
00:31:39,001 --> 00:31:42,053
Oh, and, um...
Kurt will be joining us.

834
00:31:42,054 --> 00:31:44,088
I'm famished.
Let's go to Indochine.

835
00:31:50,054 --> 00:31:52,074
Wow.

836
00:31:52,075 --> 00:31:53,082
Hm.

837
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:56,999
You look incredible.

838
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,016
They say that you haven't
settled into New York City

839
00:32:00,017 --> 00:32:02,082
until you've had your first makeover.

840
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:04,032
Mine took six months.

841
00:32:04,033 --> 00:32:06,017
Oh, really?
Like you need a makeover?

842
00:32:06,018 --> 00:32:08,032
Every girl in school
wants to date you.

843
00:32:08,033 --> 00:32:10,083
- True.
- (Giggles)

844
00:32:10,086 --> 00:32:12,066
But four years ago,

845
00:32:12,067 --> 00:32:14,082
I was a scrawny kid
from backwater Montana,

846
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:17,024
with a bad haircut and a unibrow.

847
00:32:17,025 --> 00:32:18,186
And seniors took me under their wing,

848
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:20,071
introduced me to waxes and the gym,

849
00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:22,067
- and they changed my life.
- Yeah.

850
00:32:22,068 --> 00:32:24,067
It's pretty amazing what
a good makeover can do.

851
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:26,066
It's like you change the outside,

852
00:32:26,067 --> 00:32:29,016
and then the inside
just... follows.

853
00:32:29,017 --> 00:32:31,070
I think it's the other way around.

854
00:32:31,071 --> 00:32:34,082
I think now your outside

855
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:36,050
has caught up to how
you feel about yourself.

856
00:32:36,051 --> 00:32:38,082
Hmm.

857
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:40,066
I like that.

858
00:32:40,067 --> 00:32:43,033
I like you.

859
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,083
So what are you working on?

860
00:32:49,084 --> 00:32:51,032
Just a new number.

861
00:32:51,033 --> 00:32:52,071
I like to do something every day,

862
00:32:52,072 --> 00:32:54,071
just to keep
my machine well-oiled.

863
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:57,066
Oh, me too.

864
00:32:57,067 --> 00:32:59,083
I love that song.

865
00:33:00,092 --> 00:33:02,999
Do you, uh...

866
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,020
want to sing it with me?

867
00:33:05,021 --> 00:33:07,083

You're amazing.

924
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:33,082
What are you doing tomorrow tonight?

925
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:36,554
I want to cook you dinner.

926
00:35:43,025 --> 00:35:45,049
Attention, students:

927
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:49,070
Your record-low election votes
have been tallied,

928
00:35:49,071 --> 00:35:51,024
and we have a winner.

929
00:35:51,025 --> 00:35:53,088
Becky, can I get
a xylophone flourish?

930
00:35:58,008 --> 00:36:01,024
No? Not feeling it?

931
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:03,037
Okay.

932
00:36:03,538 --> 00:36:08,021
This year's Student Council
President is...

933
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:12,075
(all cheering, shouting happily)

934
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:19,071
How do you do?

935
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,088
How you doing?

936
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:24,050
- Congratulations, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Artie.

937
00:36:24,051 --> 00:36:26,048
Losing the bow tie, that was
your game changer... kudos.

938
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:27,081
No hard feelings.

939
00:36:27,082 --> 00:36:29,033
Maybe I can find a place
for you in my administration.

940
00:36:29,034 --> 00:36:31,082
No, thanks;
I got what I needed.

941
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:33,037
Sugar asked me out on a date.

942
00:36:33,038 --> 00:36:35,007
She invited me horseback riding.

943
00:36:35,008 --> 00:36:37,499
I'm just hoping it doesn't
involve being towed.

944
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,538
- You talk to Kurt?
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

945
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:42,566
He was super proud of me
and he's really excited.

946
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:45,499
He's already planning
a whole inaugural ball.

947
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,516
Well, congratulations.

948
00:36:47,517 --> 00:36:49,000
Thanks.

949
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,086
You know,
I have not stepped foot inside

950
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:54,071
a Manhattan movie theater
since the bedbug scare.

951
00:36:54,072 --> 00:36:57,004
- (phone buzzing)
- And this is a fact:

952
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:59,016
They prefer to lay
their eggs in couture.

953
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:00,037
(all chuckle)

954
00:37:00,038 --> 00:37:01,092
That's true.
Who wouldn't?

955
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,024
(all laugh)

956
00:37:03,025 --> 00:37:04,999
I'm not lying.

957
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,503
RACHEL: What's the
last movie you saw?

958
00:37:06,504 --> 00:37:07,583
The last...
Ooh, you know what?

959
00:37:07,584 --> 00:37:10,524
The last movie I saw was
a double feature.

960
00:37:10,525 --> 00:37:12,507
It was, um, Unmarried Woman

961
00:37:12,508 --> 00:37:14,507
and The Red Balloon.

962
00:37:14,508 --> 00:37:15,531
You weren't bored.

963
00:37:15,532 --> 00:37:16,588
No, no, I wasn't even...

964
00:37:16,589 --> 00:37:18,508
That's okay.

965
00:37:19,533 --> 00:37:21,499
There's the man of the hour.

966
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,507
You all right?

967
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:26,557
You know, it didn't hit me
until right now:

968
00:37:26,558 --> 00:37:29,516
I came to McKinley
for Kurt... that's it.

969
00:37:30,517 --> 00:37:33,591
And now he's gone, and even
with Glee Club, it just...

970
00:37:34,092 --> 00:37:37,082
I feel really,
really... alone.

971
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:39,033
You're kind of killing
my party buzz, bro.

972
00:37:39,034 --> 00:37:41,032
I'm sorry, it's just that

973
00:37:41,033 --> 00:37:43,016
I did all of this for him,
I did all of this for him.

974
00:37:43,017 --> 00:37:44,050
And now he's not here.

975
00:37:44,051 --> 00:37:47,016
And so it just kind of feels
like none of it matters.

976
00:37:47,017 --> 00:37:48,071
Of course it matters.

977
00:37:48,072 --> 00:37:51,037
You're McKinley's
"First Gay Guy President."

978
00:37:51,038 --> 00:37:52,065
Nobody cares about that.

979
00:37:52,066 --> 00:37:54,088
Look, before you, Kurt was
the first gay kid I met.

980
00:37:54,089 --> 00:37:56,037
Don't get me wrong, he's great,

981
00:37:56,038 --> 00:37:58,017
but I just don't really
get his Bravo jokes

982
00:37:58,018 --> 00:38:01,049
or the fashion thing or Broadway.

983
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,004
You and me, it's different, you know?

984
00:38:03,005 --> 00:38:06,016
I never had a gaybro before.
We'd be like

985
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:07,054
Wolverine and Cyclops, you know,

986
00:38:07,055 --> 00:38:10,032
show people how we're
cool with each other.

987
00:38:10,033 --> 00:38:12,050
And you know, if you ask me,
that's what matters.

988
00:38:12,051 --> 00:38:14,016
Thanks, man.

989
00:38:14,017 --> 00:38:15,053
You're right.

990
00:38:15,054 --> 00:38:19,032
But just so we're clear...

991
00:38:19,033 --> 00:38:20,033
BOTH:
I'm Wolverine.

992
00:38:20,034 --> 00:38:21,053
I'm...

993
00:38:21,054 --> 00:38:22,524
I said it first.

994
00:38:22,525 --> 00:38:24,083
Congratulations, Blaine Warbler.

995
00:38:24,084 --> 00:38:25,999
Thank you, Brit.

996
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,566
Cool.

997
00:38:27,567 --> 00:38:31,549
Congratulations to you,
Mr. Vice President.

998
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,499
The people have spoken.

999
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,499
Can I let you in on a little secret?

1000
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,550
I like secrets.

1001
00:38:37,551 --> 00:38:39,587
I voted for you.

1002
00:38:39,588 --> 00:38:40,550
What?

1003
00:38:46,567 --> 00:38:47,916
Thank you.

1004
00:38:48,517 --> 00:38:49,532
I would've voted for you, too,

1005
00:38:49,533 --> 00:38:51,537
but I-I just
really wanted to win.

1006
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:53,502
I know losing sucks, but you know,

1007
00:38:53,503 --> 00:38:54,575
sometimes it can be a good thing.

1008
00:38:54,576 --> 00:38:56,503
Look at Al Gore.

1009
00:38:56,504 --> 00:38:58,516
He lost an election,
then he won an Oscar.

1010
00:38:58,517 --> 00:38:59,538
He did?

1011
00:39:01,504 --> 00:39:02,504
You think so?

1012
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,532
I don't know how you do it.

1013
00:39:07,533 --> 00:39:09,507
What?

1014
00:39:10,008 --> 00:39:12,503
You just always know exactly
the right thing to say.

1015
00:39:12,504 --> 00:39:13,587
It's a gift.

1016
00:39:13,588 --> 00:39:16,517
(chuckles)

1017
00:39:18,204 --> 00:39:19,499
You win.

1018
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,690
I can't believe
I'm about to say this,

1019
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,575
but I'm taking Sue
Sylvester's advice.

1020
00:39:23,276 --> 00:39:25,524
I mailed in the application.

1021
00:39:25,525 --> 00:39:26,540
Congratulations, William.

1022
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:27,586
I think it's the right decision.

1023
00:39:27,587 --> 00:39:29,590
Yeah.
There's only one problem.

1024
00:39:29,591 --> 00:39:31,583
I need a written recommendation
from a colleague,

1025
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,516
and I was thinking...

1026
00:39:32,517 --> 00:39:34,566
I'm one step ahead
of you, butt-chin.

1027
00:39:34,567 --> 00:39:36,542
I took the liberty of
composing a letter

1028
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:39,541
to the Arts Governing Board outlining

1029
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:41,587
your astonishing accomplishments.

1030
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:45,541
"Not only is William a direct
descendant of Harriet Tubman,

1031
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:48,499
he delivered my infant child
with his bare hands"?

1032
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,520
Sue, Sue, this isn't even true.

1033
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,542
Well, what can I say, William?
I want you out of here.

1034
00:39:52,543 --> 00:39:55,521
And for the first time, I think
I mean that in a good way.

1035
00:40:09,517 --> 00:40:11,516
(shrieks)

1036
00:40:11,517 --> 00:40:12,566
Oh, my God...

1037
00:40:12,567 --> 00:40:15,517
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1038
00:40:17,504 --> 00:40:18,541
Oh...

1039
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:19,583
(knocking on door)

1040
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,275
Wow.

1041
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,533
You're smokin'.

1042
00:40:28,534 --> 00:40:30,524
Oh, it's actually the duck.

1043
00:40:30,525 --> 00:40:31,566
No, no.

1044
00:40:31,567 --> 00:40:34,499
It's, it's you.

1045
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,591
Come in.

1046
00:40:36,092 --> 00:40:38,507
RACHEL:
I really wanted to cook you dinner,

1047
00:40:38,508 --> 00:40:39,588
but this is what you get.

1048
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:42,508
- This is, this is good.
- Pizza.

1049
00:40:42,511 --> 00:40:45,503
Food is food. It's, it's
the effort that counts.

1050
00:40:45,504 --> 00:40:48,566
A girl has never cooked
me dinner before.

1051
00:40:48,567 --> 00:40:49,503
I don't believe you.

1052
00:40:49,504 --> 00:40:51,517
- No.
- (Laughs)

1053
00:40:51,518 --> 00:40:52,531
No one has ever even tried.

1054
00:40:52,532 --> 00:40:53,971
I'm trying new things.

1055
00:40:53,972 --> 00:40:56,520
Doing new things, it's all part of

1056
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:57,975
you know, the new me.

1057
00:40:57,976 --> 00:40:59,516
And I like it.

1058
00:40:59,517 --> 00:41:01,570
I like, I like the new me.

1059
00:41:01,571 --> 00:41:04,507
I've never been the
cook-a-guy-dinner type.

1060
00:41:04,508 --> 00:41:06,582
I've always been the just
annoy-a-guy-for-a-year

1061
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:08,541
until-he-finally-
gives-in type.

1062
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:11,503
Well, tell, tell me
about this old Rachel.

1063
00:41:11,504 --> 00:41:13,583
- Tell me a secret.
- A secret?

1064
00:41:13,586 --> 00:41:16,499
Something that you don't want
anyone else to know.

1065
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,499
Okay, but you first.

1066
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,508
- Okay.
- Think of something very good.

1067
00:41:22,511 --> 00:41:24,583
- Okay, so, um, when I was a kid...
- Mm-hmm.

1068
00:41:24,586 --> 00:41:27,500
- I was obsessed with Ace of Base.
- No.

1069
00:41:27,503 --> 00:41:28,558
- Yes.
- (Laughs)

1070
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:30,542
I was... seriously, I had
the posters on my wall.

1071
00:41:30,543 --> 00:41:32,582
Wait. I thought you said
you were straight.

1072
00:41:32,583 --> 00:41:34,571
- Oh, come on.
- (Laughs)

1073
00:41:34,574 --> 00:41:38,570
Hot girls playing all
their own instruments...

1074
00:41:38,571 --> 00:41:40,499

You're welcome...
Your turn.

1078
00:41:45,521 --> 00:41:47,532
My turn, okay.

1079
00:41:47,533 --> 00:41:50,499
Um, I have a good one.

1080
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,583
When I was eight years old,
I got my first love letter

1081
00:41:52,584 --> 00:41:55,542
- from a guy named Tony.
- (Chuckles)

1082
00:41:55,545 --> 00:41:57,516
And he was very cute.

1083
00:41:57,517 --> 00:41:59,532
And when he gave it to me,

1084
00:41:59,533 --> 00:42:01,500
I corrected all
of the grammatical errors

1085
00:42:01,501 --> 00:42:03,500
and his spelling errors
and gave it back to him.

1086
00:42:03,501 --> 00:42:04,532
(chuckles)

1087
00:42:04,533 --> 00:42:05,583
That's so embarrassing.
(laughs)

1088
00:42:05,584 --> 00:42:07,583
I've never told anybody that before,

1089
00:42:07,584 --> 00:42:10,566
not even Finn.

1090
00:42:12,567 --> 00:42:13,982
Well, just so you know,

1091
00:42:13,983 --> 00:42:16,507
no matter how lovely this is,

1092
00:42:16,508 --> 00:42:19,507
I'm hands-off.
