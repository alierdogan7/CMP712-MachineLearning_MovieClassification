1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:03,836
(Narrator) Once upon a time...

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:10,051
or maybe twice,
there was an unearthly paradise called...

3
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:13,095
Pepperland.

4
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:28,152
80,000 leagues beneath the sea it lay,

5
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:32,281
or lie, I'm not too sure.

6
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,148
(Wicked laughter)

7
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:55,239
Pepperland is a tickle of joy
on the blue belly of the universe.

8
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,244
It must be scratched.

9
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,288
Right, Max?

10
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,957
- Yes, Your Blueness.
- What?!

11
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:10,254
We Meanies
only take no for an answer.

12
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,758
Is that understood, Max?

13
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,343
No, Your Blueness.

14
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,220
That's better.

15
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:21,265
Are the troops in readiness?

16
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,391
No, your Blueness.

17
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,644
- The Bonkers?
- No.

18
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,312
- Clowns?
- No.

19
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,272
- Snapping Turks?
- No.

20
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,941
- Anti-music missiles?
- No.

21
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,444
- The dreadful Flying Glove?
- No.

22
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,738
Splendid!

23
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:43,037
Today, Pepperland goes bluely!

24
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,457
Fire!

25
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:48,542
(Loud bang)

26
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,884
(Screaming and shouting)

27
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,554
(Cannon fire)

28
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,813
(Explosions)

29
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,913
(Bass drumbeats)

30
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,128
The Meanies are coming!
The Meanies are coming!

31
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:36,424
Glove, Glove, come here, Glove!

32
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,135
Look out there,
and what do you see?

33
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,805
- Tell him, Max.
- Someone running, Glove.

34
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,602
Well, you'll soon put a stop to that,
won't you, Glovey?

35
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,980
Go, Glove, point!

36
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:54,108
And having pointed, pounce down!

37
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,281
(Explosions)

38
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,289
(Crashing sounds)

39
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,796
(Giggling) I haven't laughed so much
since Pompeii!

40
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,508
(Explosions)

41
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,973
(Screeching halt)

42
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,684
(Guffawing)

43
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,939
(Splash)

44
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:38,068
What?! What?!
The Glove is losing his touch.

45
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,573
Do your worst!

46
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,202
Explode them!

47
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,371
(Honk)

48
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,083
(Honk)

49
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,961
(Loud explosion)

50
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,678
(Stammering) It's not polite to point!

51
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,766
(Loud guffawing)

52
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,568
Thing of beauty...
destroy it for ever!

53
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,868
(Loud explosion)

54
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,495
(Whimpering)

55
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,420
Sir, Sir, the Blue Meanies
are coming!

56
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:44,593
Not here, Young Fred.
They wouldn't dare.

57
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:48,597
They would. They are.
What are you going to do?

58
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,934
Finish the quartet.

59
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,310
Fire!

60
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,524
(Loud banging)

61
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,236
Trio, sir?

62
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,701
(Fred) Duet, sir?

63
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,369
Duet?

64
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,415
Solo!

65
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:23,382
Young Fred,
the Blue Meanies are coming!

66
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,598
(Explosions)

67
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:44,486
(Lord Mayor)
4 scores and 32 bars ago,

68
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:47,990
- our forefathers...
- Our quartet?

69
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:52,202
- and foremothers...
- Another quartet?

70
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,998
made it in this yellow submarine...

71
00:06:56,124 --> 00:07:00,002
- What, that little thing?
- to Pepperland.

72
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,674
Climb aboard, Young Fred.

73
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,510
But, sir, I can't even
make my soap float.

74
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:12,181
I'm appointing you Lord Admiral.

75
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:15,142
Lord Admiral?
In that event, yes.

76
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:22,983
Hurry, Young Fred.
Go! Get help!

77
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,652
Where should I go?

78
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,907
(Lord Mayor) No time for trivialities.

79
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,501
(# THE BEATLES:
"Yellow Submarine")

80
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,609
(Brass band playing)

81
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,483
(Engine noise)

82
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,907
(Ship horn)

83
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,871
(# THE BEATLES:
"Eleanor Rigby")

84
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,621
(Wind blowing)

85
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,083
(Bang)

86
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:17,671
Woe... is me.

87
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,719
Liverpool can be a lonely place
on a Saturday night.

88
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,346
And this is only Thursday morning.

89
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,516
(Thinks) Compared with my life,
Eleanor Rigby's was a gay, mad whirl.

90
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,184
Nothing ever happens to me.

91
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,354
(Thinks) I feel like an old,
splintered drumstick.

92
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,734
I'd jump into the River Mersey,
but it looks like rain.

93
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,696
Nothing ever happens to me.

94
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,705
(Engine noise)

95
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:27,574
Puss, puss-puss.
Puss, puss, puss. Here, pussy.

96
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:31,453
Here, pussy, pussy, pussy.
Here, pussy, pussy.

97
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:46,134
- (Policeman) Ahem, er...
- (Cat meows)

98
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,889
Would you believe me if I told you I was
being followed by a yellow submarine?

99
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,851
No, I would not.

100
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,104
Oh yeah, I didn't think you would.

101
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,398
(Engine noise)

102
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,320
I could have sworn
there was a yellow submarine.

103
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,322
But that isn't logical, is it?

104
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,367
It must have been one of them
unidentified flying cupcakes

105
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,369
or a figment of my imagination.

106
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,581
But I don't have an imagination.

107
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,543
(Engine noise)

108
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,387
Help, help, help!

109
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,264
(Ringo) Thanks, I don't need any.

110
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,518
Help! Won't you please,
please help me?

111
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:40,105
- (Ringo) Be specific.
- (Talking gibberish)

112
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,239
...Blue Meanies!

113
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,699
What you need is...

114
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,243
'H' for hurry, 'E' for ergent,

115
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:58,498
'L' for love me
and 'P' for p-p-please help.

116
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,176
(Door slams loudly)

117
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,737
(Slamming doors and strange noises)

118
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,533
Hiya, baby!

119
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,842
(Screeching halt)

120
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,970
Your story has touched my heart.

121
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,805
Jump in, we'll get my friends.

122
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,433
- Bless you!
- Did I sneeze?

123
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,314
- Just park it here.
- I'll just park it here.

124
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,695
(Slamming doors and strange noises)

125
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,323
What would your friends
be doing here?

126
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,574
Displaying.

127
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,911
- Displaying what?
- Displaying around.

128
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,921
(Fred) Can't we take one of these?

129
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,131
No. I only work with my mates.

130
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,553
(Fred) Frankenstein?

131
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,388
I used to go out with his sister.

132
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,473
- His sister?
- Yeah. Phyllis.

133
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,101
Hey, I wonder what would happen
if I pulled this lever.

134
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,602
You mustn't do that.

135
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,729
Can't help it.
I'm a born lever-puller.

136
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,281
(Creaking noise)

137
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,954
(Booming noise)

138
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,725
Ringo, I've just had
the strangest dream.

139
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,852
(Ringo) I warned you not to eat
on an empty stomach.

140
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,854
Now listen to Old Fred.

141
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,356
(Talking gibberish)

142
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,446
...Blue Meanies!

143
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,240
(Fred) What do you think?

144
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,328
I think he needs a rehearsal.

145
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,331
(John) When do we leave?

146
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,541
(Fred) Let's get the other two, John.

147
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,003
(John) What day is it?
(Ringo) Sitarday.

148
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,796
Then George will be here.

149
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,382
(Sitar music)

150
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:23,870
(Wind blowing)

151
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,958
(Ringo) George,
what are you doing up there?

152
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,794
- (George) Now, what is it, Ringo?
- (Engine noise)

153
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,212
(Car horn)

154
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,048
(George) Is there a matter
you'd like to take up

155
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,009
or down?

156
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,803
This chap here...

157
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,681
(Fred talking gibberish)

158
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:47,352
(All) ...Blue Meanies!

159
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,313
You're nuts, the pair of you.

160
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,400
Wait a minute, that's my car.

161
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,237
- (George) How do you know it's your car?
- I'd know it anywhere.

162
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,574
- (George) What's it look like, then?
- It's red with yellow wheels.

163
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,162
I mean, blue with orange wheels.

164
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,873
- (Horn sounds)
- (George) It's all in the mind.

165
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,960
(Ringo) Move over, I'm driving.
(George) I got here first.

166
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,087
(John) I'll drive, if you like.
(George) No, you sit in the middle.

167
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,131
(Ringo) I'm sitting in the middle.
(John) You said you were driving.

168
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:19,092
(Ringo) I am driving.
(George) I'll get in the back, then.

169
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,395
(Explosion and screeching tyres)

170
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,948

171
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,956

(Woman screaming)

173
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,516
(George) Do you think
we're interrupting something?

174
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,268
(Ringo) I think so.

175
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,146
We'd better find Paul, hadn't we?

176
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,487
It's all in the mind.

177
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,530
Try one of those doors.

178
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,285
(Cheering crowd)

179
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,958
Yes, they do look very nice,
don't they?

180
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,084
Yes, they do.

181
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,212
- They do, though, don't they?
- Yes, they do.

182
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,506
- Don't dey, dough?
- Dough?

183
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,051
- Don't ask.
- Dat's dough.

184
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:45,762
What's the matter, fellas?
Blue Meanies?

185
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,473
- (Door slams)
- Well, lads, what do you think?

186
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,016
(John) I think that...

187
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,769
Remember,
there'll be rough seas ahead.

188
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,103
So, what do you think?

189
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,396
(Paul) Well, then, um...

190
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:58,983
Pounding, overwhelming waves.
What do you think of that?

191
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,402
(Paul) Well, I think that...
(John) As a matter of fact, I...

192
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:02,570
(All) I think...

193
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,572
(Fred) Well?
(All) I've forgotten.

194
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,200
Right, then,
let's get this vessel shipshape.

195
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,994
(Ringo) I kind of like the way it is,
submarine shape.

196
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,705
(Engine noise)

197
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,876
So, this is a submarine.

198
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,335
Soft, isn't it?

199
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,045
Not if you're on the bottom.

200
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:04,382
All right, lads,
time to stow the gab and turn to.

201
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:07,051
Groovy. How do you start this thing?

202
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,889
It starts with a Blue Meanie attack.

203
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,600
Supposing there's no Blue Meanies
in the neighbourhood?

204
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:18,271
(Talking gibberish)
Then you start looking for a switch.

205
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,482
(Guitar playing)

206
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,194

It's time for time.

210
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:43,291
Look, the hands are slowing down.

211
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,136
(Paul) Do you ever get the feeling...
(John) Yeah.

212
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:58,973
that things aren't as rosy
as they appear to be under the surface?

213
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,850
(George) What's happening, John?

214
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,977
(John) In my humble opinion,
we've become involved

215
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:06,856
in Einstein's time-space
continuum theory.

216
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,150
- Relatively speaking, that is.
- Of course.

217
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,320
(George) Maybe time's gone on strike.
(Paul) What for?

218
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:14,530
- Shorter hours.
- I don't blame it.

219
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,532
It must be very tiring being time,
mustn't it?

220
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:19,410
- (All) Why?
- It's a twenty-four hour day, isn't it?

221
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,537
- You surprise me, Ringo.
- Why?

222
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:26,167
- Dealing in abstracts.
- Just because I'm a drummer...

223
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:30,505
- I don't half feel funny.
- You're not half the lad you used to be.

224
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:32,340
Look, everything's getting bigger.

225
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,801
It's not.
It's us that are getting smaller...

226
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,970
- I want my mam.
- ...and younger.

227
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:41,057
There you are, lads.
Old Fred will get you out of all this.

228
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,852
Look at that!

229
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:48,815
- It's all a load of Father Xmas's.
- (John) It's not. It's Father Time.

230
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,525
- How do you know?
- I read it in a book.

231
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:54,237
I don't want to alarm you,
but the years are going backwards.

232
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,531
What's that mean, Old Fred?

233
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,866
If we slip back through time
at this rate,

234
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,494
very soon we'll all disappear
up our own existence.

235
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,748

- We could always try a few buttons.

- I want my mam.

237

I'm afraid.

238
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,881
- Can't we do something to the clock?
- (Ringo) What do you mean, John?

239
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,842
(John) Move the hands forward,
see what happens.

240
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,385
(Fred) Clever lad.

241
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,262
(George) Something strange is happening.

242
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:28,980
It's speeding up now.

243
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:32,567

00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,619
Funny... a submarine
remarkably like our own.

245
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:45,788
(John) Uncannily.

246
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,583
(Ringo) There's someone in it. Look.

247
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:51,627
(George) And they're waving.
(Ringo) It's a group of fellas.

248
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,255
Wave back.

249
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:57,258
(George) Maybe we're both part of
a vast yellow submarine fleet.

250
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,093
There's only two of us.

251
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:02,847
Then I would suggest that
yonder yellow submarine is ourselves

but would you agree that we have been
passing through the Sea of Time?

00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,237
Here, lads. Look at this.

348
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,448
- What do you think it is?
- Nothing.

349
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,033
Looks like nothing.

350
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,077
It's a local inhabitant.

351
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:57,037
(Ringo) He's probably one of the nothings.

352
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,206
(Paul) At least that's something.

353
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:01,208
- (Paul) Let's show him our motor.
- Steady on.

354
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:03,710
You don't want to show
your motor to just anybody.

355
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,087
But this is a nobody.

356
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:10,258
Medic, pedic, zed oblique,
orphic, morphic, dorphic, Greek.

357
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:13,220
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.

358
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:16,223
So little time, so much to know.

359
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:17,849
Can you tell us where we're at?

360
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,102
A true Socratic query, that.

361
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,270
And who the Billy Shears are you?

362
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:25,857
Who? Who indeed am I?

363
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,777
Jeremy?

364
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,196
Hillary?

365
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,407
Boob?

366
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:35,909
- Ph.D.?
- (All) Who?

367
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,453
Eminent physicist, polyglot, classicist,

368
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,789
prize-winning botanist,
hard biting satirist,

369
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:44,251
- talented pianist, good dentist, too.
- (Paul) Lousy poet.

370
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:46,169
Critic's voice,
take your choice.

371
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:49,214
- Must be one of them angry young men.
- Or a daffy old creep.

372
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,341
I, daffy old creep?

373
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:56,513
- Do you speak English?
- Old English, middle, a dialect, pure...

374
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,850
- Well, do you speak English?
- You know, I'm not sure.

375
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:02,769
He's so smart, he doesn't even
remember what he knows.

376
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,688
Why don't we show him our motor?

377
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:06,773
Should we really...
show him our motor?

378
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,275
He may not have seen one before.

379
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,736
Turbo-prop, super-combustible spring.

380
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,030
Metrocyclonic and stereophonic,

381
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:16,658
this motor, I see,
has a broken down thing.

382
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,745
- He fixed it.
- He fixed it?

383
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,246
Great. Let's go.

384
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:27,669
I must complete my bust, two novels,
finish my blueprints, begin my beguine.

385
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,297
Must you always talk in rhyme?

386
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:34,760
If I spoke prose, you'd all find out,
I don't know what I talk about.

387
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,387
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.

388
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,598
So little time, so much to know.

389
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:41,850
Hey, fellas. Look.

390
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:44,603
The footnotes for my 19th book.

391
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,688
This is my standard procedure
for doing it.

392
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,066
And while I compose it,
I'm also reviewing it.

393
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:52,152
- A boob for all seasons.
- How can he lose?

394
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,403
Were your notices good?

395
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,489
It's my policy never to read my reviews.

396
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:58,158
There must be a word for what he is.

397
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:01,787
(# THE BEATLES:
"Nowhere Man")

398
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,360
Okay, men, all aboard.
Let's go somewhere.

399
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,278
What about him?

400
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,906
He's happy enough
going around in circles.

401
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,575
Poor little fella.

402
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:49,162
I don't know.
Ringo's just a sentimentalist.

403
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:52,249
Look at him.
Can't he come with us?

404
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:59,839
Mr. Boob, you can come with us,
if you like.

405
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:02,425
You mean, you'd take a Nowhere Man?

406
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,135
Come on, we'll take you somewhere.

407
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:08,181
Okay, Booby. Down the hatch.

408
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:12,018
Down the hatch.
A quite curious phrase.

409
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:15,313
The middle South Midlands
Victorian phase.

410
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,108
Its usage undoubtedly on the increase.

411
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:20,860
I must work it into
my New Statesman piece.

412
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:23,780
- That's the hatch, friend.
- Indeed.

413
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,366
Steady now, crew.
Prepare to go forward.

414
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:28,743
- Forward.
- Forward.

415
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,412
- Forward.
- Forward.

416
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,247
(Fred) Forward!

417
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:50,348
(John) It's awfully quiet.
What shall we do, Jeremy?

418
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:56,146
Repair, revive, revamp, renew.
Ipse dixit, just turn the screw.

419
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:17,000
- Log sign, clog sign, big thingamabob.
- (George) What's he saying?

420
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:19,461
- (Paul) What's he doing?
- Chewing gum will do the job.

421
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:22,005
- A turn of the screw, and all is...
- (Propellers whirring)

422
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:23,923
...and all is new.

423
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,592
(Fred) I can't stop her.

424
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:30,180
'H' is for hurry, 'E' is for ergent,
'L' is for love me...

425
00:47:30,306 --> 00:47:32,557
(John) 'P' is for... goodbye?

426
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,935
(George) That was lovely, Jeremy.
(Paul) We've lost the sub for good.

427
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:38,146
- Or for bad.
- (Ringo) Or for worse.

428
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:42,317
- I'm sorry about that.
- (Ringo) But he did fix the motor.

429
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:47,947
(Paul) Where are we?
(John) It looks like the foothills.

430
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:51,409
(George) The foothills of what?
(John) The foothills of the headlands.

431
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:57,749
(Strange sounds)

432
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:07,092
(# THE BEATLES:
"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds")

433
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:11,609
(John) Carry on, lads, carry on.
(Ringo) Certainly was carrying on.

434
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:16,573
(George) I feel a draft.

435
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:18,825
(Paul) We must be
near the Sea of Holes.

436
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,912
Don't you think we should
ask somebody for directions?

437
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,873
Excuse us...

438
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,667
Can you tell us
the way to Pepperland?

439
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:29,836
(Mechanical whirring)

440
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:33,214
(George) Thanks.

441
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:38,219
(Paul) Gosh, look at all this dust!

442
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,431
(George) Where did it come from?

443
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:44,517
A chemical error and quite imprecise.
This is a condiment...

444
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:47,061
- Condi...
- A spice.

445
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,564
- He's right, you know. It's pepper.
- Pepper?

446
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:52,650
- Pepper.
- (Ringo and George sneeze)

447
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:55,612
(Deep inhaling and sneezing)

448
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,407
John?

449
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,034
Paul?

450
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,994
George?

451
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,788
Is anybody home?

452
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:49,165
- Where are we?
- A holey sea.

453
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,918
This place reminds me
of Blackburn, Lancashire.

454
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:53,127
Oh, boy...

455
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:55,755
How many do you think
there are in all?

456
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:58,716
Enough to fill the Albert Hall.

457
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:02,261
Didn't Old Fred mention something
about the Sea of Holes

458
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:04,555
- just before the Sea of Green?
- Yeah.

459
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,683
Through one of them slots
must be the Sea of Green.

460
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:08,893
But which? Which one?

461
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:13,564
Thesis, antithesis, synthesis,

462
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,901
causes of causal causation.

463
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:23,741
Jeremy, what do you know about holes?

464
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:27,078
There are simply no holes
in my education.

465
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:31,833
You mean you haven't composed
a whole book?

466
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:34,335
Great. What shall we do?

467
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,838
Be empirical. Look.

468
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:38,798
(Ringo) The booby's making
more and more sense.

469
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,758
It's getting better all the time.

470
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,219
Great. Come on, let's all
look for the Sea of Green.

471
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:48,975
The Sea of Holes...
into the Sea of Green.

472
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:55,732
Hydrolate, verdant chrysodine.

473
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:58,276
I think we're near the Sea of Green.

474
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:09,328
I've got a hole in my pocket.

475
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:12,081
Where's Jeremy?

476
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,374
He was over there.

477
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,002
- He's not here now.
- (John) He must have jumped ship, then.

478
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:19,255
He wouldn't do that.
He's our friend.

479
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:23,843
Booby, Jeremy, Hillary,
where are you?

480
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:27,054
(Echo) Sea of Green...

481
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:47,575
(Ringo) Pepperland.
A bit salty around the edges.

482
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,494
(John) Looks all dingy.
(George) And drab.

483
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,078
(Paul) And quiet.

484
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,249
Safe at last.

485
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:58,878
And none the worse for our adventures.

486
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:03,132
Reminiscent in many ways
of the late Mr. Ulysses.

487
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,638
There's an eye in the apples.

488
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:16,187
(Engine noise)

489
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,325
(Fred) There she blows!

490
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:37,583
Lord Mayor, sir...
I've made it, I'm back.

491
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:40,211
- Who's this?
- Our Lord Mayor.

492
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:42,839
He's been bonked.

493
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:46,551
Lord Mayor, sir...
unbonk yourself.

494
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:51,264
Even a little snatch of a tune
might get him up again.

495
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:52,765
All right, let's sing.

496
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:58,479
# Have you got time to rectify,
time to rectify...

497
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:01,274
Do I hear music?

498
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:06,487
Do I see... Young Fred?

499
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,739
You do, Lord Mayor.

500
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:14,120
Bless my metronome.

501
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:16,455
And did you bring help?

502
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:19,125
Yes, yes. Look.

503
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:22,795
Holy pizzicato, Young Fred.

504
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:27,884
It's quite uncanny, your faces...

505
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,385
We're quite cute, really.

506
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:32,388
You could pass for the originals.

507
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,307
We are the originals.

508
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:38,477
No, no... Sgt. Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band.

509
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:40,855
(John) They couldn't be much
with a name like that.

510
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:41,981
Sergeant Pepper?

511
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:46,777
(Lord Mayor) You could impersonate them
and rally the land to rebellion.

512
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,991
Where are your instruments?

513
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:55,077
(Ringo) Lost in the Monstrous Sea.
(John) Sea of Monsters.

514
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:57,747
(Fred) We'll get other instruments,
Lord Mayor.

515
00:56:57,873 --> 00:56:59,665
Not a chance.

516
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:04,170
The Meanies captured everything

(Paul) It's not a goldfish bowl.
(Ringo) Just a big glass bowl, then.

- It's blue glass.
- It must be from Kentucky.

could well be applied here.

01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:43,254
Shh, that's enough, Jeremy.

689
01:20:49,636 --> 01:20:53,264
- The whole world's being attacked.
- What do you want me to do?

690
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:55,808
Do you recommend fisticuffs
versus the guard?

691
01:20:57,144 --> 01:20:58,936
Oh, guard!

692
01:20:59,063 --> 01:21:00,897
Blue Meanio!

693
01:21:02,232 --> 01:21:04,275
Left to the nostril, right uppercut,

694
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:06,486
right to the eyebrow, left to the gut.

695
01:21:07,738 --> 01:21:09,155
(Giggling)

696
01:21:12,576 --> 01:21:13,910
Jeremy!

697
01:21:16,163 --> 01:21:17,372
Come on, Ringo!

698
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:25,088
Get back! Get back!

699
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:28,758
Once more unto the breach,
dear Meanies!

700
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:33,805
You're advancing the wrong way!
Retreat backwards!

701
01:21:33,931 --> 01:21:36,224
Get back there now!

702
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:39,352
My kingdom for a horse!

703
01:21:44,108 --> 01:21:45,608
(Sobbing)

704
01:21:52,282 --> 01:21:55,410
I think I'll tear him up
into little pieces.

705
01:21:55,536 --> 01:21:56,702
He does, does he?

706
01:21:56,829 --> 01:22:00,498
Yes, I think I'll make
a blueburger out of him.

707
01:22:00,624 --> 01:22:02,625
Ha-ha, I don't care what you think.

708
01:22:04,086 --> 01:22:05,711
You don't, eh?

709
01:22:05,838 --> 01:22:09,590
We'll soon see about that.

710
01:22:13,637 --> 01:22:15,930
He does in truth seem quite annoyed,

711
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:19,225
some reference material
before I'm destroyed.

712
01:22:20,686 --> 01:22:24,105
Where ground is soft most often grows,

713
01:22:24,231 --> 01:22:28,776
Arise, arise, arouse, a rose.

714
01:22:29,486 --> 01:22:31,028
A rosy nose?

715
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:35,366
Speak your last piece!

716
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:39,454
Peace, peace,
supplant the doom and the gloom.

717
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:41,789
Turn off what is sour,

718
01:22:41,915 --> 01:22:45,293
turn into a flower and bloom, bloom.

719
01:22:45,419 --> 01:22:49,380
Ha-ha, bloom, ha-ha, bloom,
bloom, bloom...

720
01:22:55,596 --> 01:22:57,763
(Screaming)

721
01:23:04,271 --> 01:23:06,355
(Laughing)

722
01:23:07,316 --> 01:23:11,068
First time I saw that Nowhere Man,
that nobody,

723
01:23:11,195 --> 01:23:14,572
- I knew he was somebody.
- You're right.

724
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:16,616
Hello there, blue people.

725
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:19,243
Won't you join us?

726
01:23:19,369 --> 01:23:22,288
Buck up, and otherwise go mingle.

727
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:26,000
- What do you say?
- Max?

728
01:23:26,126 --> 01:23:27,418
Your Blue...

729
01:23:27,544 --> 01:23:30,338
I mean, your Newness!

730
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:34,091
It's no longer a blue world, Max.

731
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:36,302
Where could we go?

732
01:23:36,887 --> 01:23:38,429
Argentina?

733
01:23:38,555 --> 01:23:39,764
Are you with us?

734
01:23:41,058 --> 01:23:42,600
Will you join?

735
01:23:42,726 --> 01:23:46,562
- Shall we?
- No!

736
01:23:47,231 --> 01:23:48,564
(Shrieking)

737
01:23:51,235 --> 01:23:53,027
Yes, your Newness!

738
01:23:53,153 --> 01:23:58,032
- Yes, Max...
- (Jeremy) Yes.

739
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:01,786
Oh, yes is a word
with a glorious ring,

740
01:24:01,912 --> 01:24:04,789
A true, universal, euphonious thing.

741
01:24:04,915 --> 01:24:08,543
In genders embracing
and chasing of blues,

742
01:24:08,669 --> 01:24:14,257
the very best word
for the whole world to use. Ha-ha!

743
01:24:14,383 --> 01:24:16,634
Yes, let us mix, Max.

744
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:19,804
I've never admitted it before,

745
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:23,182
but my cousin
is the Bluebird of Happiness.

746
01:24:25,561 --> 01:24:27,812
(Guitar feedback)

747
01:24:49,042 --> 01:24:51,794
(# THE BEATLES:
"It's All Too Much")

748
01:26:53,375 --> 01:26:55,918
- Catchy tune, that.
- I can't seem to get it out of my head.

749
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:59,088
- Then shake it.
- That's what we've been doing all night.

750
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:00,756
Yeah, it was a great party.

751
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:03,134
And we brought back
lots of lovely souvenirs.

752
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:06,554
- Here is the motor.
- And I've got a little love.

753
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:09,473
- And I've got a hole in my pocket.
- A hole?

754
01:27:09,599 --> 01:27:12,977
Half a hole, anyway.
I gave the rest to Jeremy.

755
01:27:13,103 --> 01:27:15,187
What can he do with half a hole?

756
01:27:15,313 --> 01:27:18,149
Fix it to keep his mind from wandering.

757
01:27:19,609 --> 01:27:21,068
Look at John, will you?

758
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:23,279
What's the matter, John?
Blue Meanies?

759
01:27:23,405 --> 01:27:24,989
Newer and bluer Meanies
have been sighted

760
01:27:25,115 --> 01:27:27,199
within the vicinity of this theatre.

761
01:27:27,325 --> 01:27:28,701
There's only one way to go out.

762
01:27:28,827 --> 01:27:30,119
- How's that?
- Singing.

763
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:32,329
One... two... three... four

764
01:27:32,456 --> 01:27:35,207
