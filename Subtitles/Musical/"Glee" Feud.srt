1
00:00:02,027 --> 00:00:03,343
(crying)
Emma, stop, stop, stop.

2
00:00:06,915 --> 00:00:09,900
Emma's left the building.

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,688
She say anything about me?

4
00:00:14,706 --> 00:00:17,708
No, why would she?
Because I kissed her.

5
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:21,879
(school bell ringing)
ARTIE: Mr. Shue, Finn,

6
00:00:21,913 --> 00:00:24,365
thank you for agreeing
to this sit-down.

7
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,201
We've all noticed the tension
between you ever since Finn

8
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,503
admitted he kissed
Miss Pillsbury.

9
00:00:29,537 --> 00:00:31,055
Sorry I'm late.
Huge line up at the Lima Bean,

10
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:34,374
but here are the lattes that
Mr. Shue made me get everybody.

11
00:00:34,393 --> 00:00:37,678
Um, I asked for two pumps
of mocha, Finn.

12
00:00:37,712 --> 00:00:40,314
I taste three. Take 'em back.

13
00:00:40,348 --> 00:00:43,017
All of them.

14
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:45,385
I'm sorry, Mr. Shue, but all
I did was pick up the vests.

15
00:00:45,404 --> 00:00:47,321
I didn't... What's most
upsetting is you actually think

16
00:00:47,355 --> 00:00:48,722
these vests are clean,

17
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,660
that it's okay
to turn in subpar work.

18
00:00:52,694 --> 00:00:54,361
No surprise.
Finn has been acting

19
00:00:54,396 --> 00:00:56,063
like he's losing his mind.

20
00:00:56,081 --> 00:00:57,731
Great job, Ryder!
See that, guys?

21
00:00:57,749 --> 00:01:00,234
Prowess on the football field
<i>and</i> a terrific singing voice

22
00:01:00,252 --> 00:01:03,170
are not mutually exclusive.
I can't take it anymore!

23
00:01:03,205 --> 00:01:05,673
Okay, it's bad enough you're
treating me like your lackey,

24
00:01:05,707 --> 00:01:08,092
but I'm not gonna sit here
while you fake-compliment Ryder

25
00:01:08,126 --> 00:01:10,127
just to hurt me!

26
00:01:13,748 --> 00:01:16,750
(school bell ringing) You're feuding.
And it needs to stop.

27
00:01:16,768 --> 00:01:19,019
Seriously. It's like
Hatfields and McCoys in here.

28
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:21,439
So epic musical feuds
is our theme.

29
00:01:21,473 --> 00:01:23,858
And for the first time in Glee
Club history, we are giving you

30
00:01:23,892 --> 00:01:25,526
our fearless leaders,
an assignment.

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,862
You two will explore
and resolve your differences

32
00:01:27,896 --> 00:01:29,429
by performing a song together

33
00:01:29,448 --> 00:01:32,550
inspired
by a classic musical rivalry.

34
00:01:32,584 --> 00:01:34,368
Guys...
Regionals are coming up,

35
00:01:34,402 --> 00:01:36,570
Mr. Shue, and if we're gonna
have any chance of winning,

36
00:01:36,605 --> 00:01:37,472
we need both of you.

37
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:40,008
On the same page and
on the same team.

38

(sighs)

40
00:01:52,304 --> 00:01:53,754
False alarm.

41
00:01:53,788 --> 00:01:55,756
Thank God. I'm so happy.

42
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,424
I'm so glad
this is all over with.

43
00:01:57,458 --> 00:02:00,761
Thank you
for taking me here today.

44
00:02:00,795 --> 00:02:02,462
All right,
I'm gonna go to class.

45
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:05,232
Whoa, hey. That's it?

46
00:02:05,267 --> 00:02:07,234
That's all you have
to say about this?

47
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:10,137
Well, the doctor gave me the
all-clear. What else is there?

48
00:02:10,155 --> 00:02:13,324
Rachel, you can't just blow past
this like nothing ever happened.

49
00:02:14,826 --> 00:02:16,810
This is a wake-up call.
This is an opportunity

50
00:02:16,828 --> 00:02:18,812
for you to take a hard look
at the choices

51
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,831
that you're making,
where your life is heading.

52
00:02:22,284 --> 00:02:24,668
Starting with Donkey Face.

53
00:02:32,627 --> 00:02:35,763
Hey, I'm Dallas.
What's your name?

54
00:02:35,797 --> 00:02:37,932
Uh, Gunnar.

55
00:02:37,966 --> 00:02:38,933
(chuckles) Dude, relax.

56
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:41,268
I've seen you here
the past few weeks.

57
00:02:41,303 --> 00:02:44,605
Look around.
We're not exactly alone.

58
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:47,858
Look, this isn't a
real thing for me, okay?

59
00:02:47,893 --> 00:02:51,779
It's... I need it
for my tuition, you know?

60
00:02:51,813 --> 00:02:55,950
Hey, man, I'm sure everyone
has a legit reason to be here.

61
00:02:55,984 --> 00:02:57,851
Speaking of.
We'll talk about it.

(bell ringing)

100
00:05:36,511 --> 00:05:38,862
Young Burt Reynolds,
may I gently remind you

101
00:05:38,897 --> 00:05:42,449
that on Wednesday, December 5,
you joined the Cheerios!

102
00:05:42,484 --> 00:05:44,868
But you've been conspicuously
absent from practice

103
00:05:44,903 --> 00:05:47,454
since Thursday, December 6.

104
00:05:47,489 --> 00:05:49,840
We've told you,
we only joined for a day

105
00:05:49,874 --> 00:05:51,625
when we thought
Glee Club was disbanding.

106
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:54,461
And yet you signed
this legally binding contract

107
00:05:54,496 --> 00:05:59,967
that clearly states
on page 43, paragraph 7C-9:

108
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:03,137
"Blaine Devon Anderson will
provide said Cheerios! Duty

109
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:05,789
"at any and all pep rallies,
assemblies, town meetings,

110
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,475
"state fairs, concerts,
television programs,

111
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,177
"motion pictures, video games,

112
00:06:10,211 --> 00:06:11,462
Republican national
conventions..."

113
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,147
I never signed that.

114
00:06:13,181 --> 00:06:16,850
Well, that's funny, because
your signature says you did.

115
00:06:17,902 --> 00:06:19,737
That's a forgery.
And you can't prove that.

116
00:06:19,771 --> 00:06:20,821
I probably could.

117
00:06:20,855 --> 00:06:23,157
Cheerios! Regionals
is fast approaching,

118
00:06:23,191 --> 00:06:25,325
and I need a shiny,
sexually non-threatening gay

119
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,994
to hoist up some
of the most gorgeous girls

120
00:06:27,028 --> 00:06:28,529
in America over his head,

121
00:06:28,563 --> 00:06:31,331
have a bird's-eye view
of their baby oven,

122
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:33,333
and not be even remotely
interested.

123
00:06:33,368 --> 00:06:34,835
And that would be you.

124
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:37,904
Thank you, but I'm just
too busy with Glee Club

125
00:06:37,922 --> 00:06:39,506
and Student Council.

126
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,842
If you need me back,
I guess I could do it.

127
00:06:41,876 --> 00:06:43,610
Why are you even here?

128
00:06:43,645 --> 00:06:45,162
You called me out of class.

129
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,163
You're dismissed.

130
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,331
Go find a new boyfriend.

131
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,766
Maybe Lance Bass is available.

132
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,185
Or RuPaul.

133
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:52,186
Suit up, soldier.

134
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,687
I'll help you put it on.

135
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:56,356
No, thank you, Becky. I'm-I'm
not rejoining the Cheerios!

136
00:06:56,391 --> 00:06:57,674
Oh, you most certainly are.

137
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,244
Or something very unfortunate
will most likely

138
00:07:00,278 --> 00:07:03,263
be happening to you
extremely soon.

139
00:07:03,281 --> 00:07:05,182

140
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,450
Uh, yeah!

00:07:06,484 --> 00:07:08,285

Say what?

164
00:08:07,795 --> 00:08:09,829
Say what a jerk-knuckle you are
for messing with my girl

165
00:08:09,848 --> 00:08:12,099
and putting that big old
square head in her face.

166
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:14,184
Marley likes Jake.

167
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:16,603
And we in Glee Club
like that two-for-one combo.

168
00:08:16,638 --> 00:08:18,372
This is kind of none
of your business.

169
00:08:18,406 --> 00:08:20,190
Did you not notice that I'm
sitting on different sides

170
00:08:20,225 --> 00:08:21,841

He won't speak to her.

00:08:23,311 --> 00:08:25,362
Who are you calling a dude?
I am no dude.

173
00:08:25,396 --> 00:08:28,649
So what are you then?
I am a proud black woman.

174
00:08:30,318 --> 00:08:31,902
No, you're a dude.

175
00:08:33,488 --> 00:08:35,272
<i>He was way out of line.</i>

176
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,791
KATIE: <i>Didn't you tell me it
was Feud Week in Glee Club?</i>

177
00:08:37,825 --> 00:08:39,793
<i>Well, get your aggression</i>
<i>out through song.</i>

178
00:08:39,827 --> 00:08:41,128
<i>Challenge him to a duel.</i>

179
00:08:41,162 --> 00:08:44,298
<i>Has anyone ever told you</i>
<i>you're kind of a genius?</i>

180
00:08:44,332 --> 00:08:47,367
KATIE (chuckles):
Later, baby.

181
00:08:49,604 --> 00:08:50,554
(bell ringing)

182
00:08:50,588 --> 00:08:51,838
(Will claps hands once)

183
00:08:51,872 --> 00:08:53,540
We need
to do something muscular,

184
00:08:53,558 --> 00:08:56,143
like Biggie versus Tupac.
Now, we know how that ended.

185
00:08:56,177 --> 00:09:00,647
Look, we don't need to do this
stupid assignment, Mr. Shue.

186
00:09:00,682 --> 00:09:02,649
Don't act like you're above
these kids, Finn.

187
00:09:02,684 --> 00:09:04,685
Not that long ago,
you were one of them.

188
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:06,303
We can just talk.

189
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,690
(chuckles) Unless you have
some stunning new revelation

190
00:09:09,724 --> 00:09:12,075
about why you kissed
my bride-to-be,

191
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,362
I've already heard everything
you have to say.

192
00:09:15,396 --> 00:09:18,615
Besides, I don't think
you could take it.

193
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,402
I can take it.

194
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,737
Okay.

195
00:09:28,126 --> 00:09:30,594
I put you in charge
of the Glee Club, Finn...

196
00:09:30,628 --> 00:09:33,547
not because you were
a national champion

197
00:09:33,581 --> 00:09:35,182
and not because
you were qualified

198
00:09:35,216 --> 00:09:36,750
with something
like a teaching degree,

199
00:09:36,768 --> 00:09:38,585
or even a single college credit,

200
00:09:38,603 --> 00:09:39,853
for that matter.

201
00:09:39,887 --> 00:09:41,755
I gave you the Glee Club
because you were lost;

202
00:09:41,773 --> 00:09:43,757
You just got dumped
by your girlfriend;

203
00:09:43,775 --> 00:09:45,192
You flunked out of the army;

204
00:09:45,226 --> 00:09:48,261
And the real truth is
I just took pity on you.

205
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:50,297
Wow.

206
00:09:50,331 --> 00:09:52,599
Yeah. You wanted to talk.

207
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,267
Yeah, I did,
but I didn't think...

208
00:09:54,285 --> 00:09:56,403
So I put all this trust in you

209
00:09:56,437 --> 00:09:58,772
so that you can get back
on your feet,

210
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,906
and what do you do?

211
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,776
You betray me
in the worst way possible.

212
00:10:03,795 --> 00:10:05,862
You broke the code
of a brother, Finn.

213
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,799
I know that.
And I'm so sorry.

214
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,550
Sorry's not gonna cut it.

215
00:10:10,585 --> 00:10:14,137
So start thinking of some
of the nastiest music feuds

216
00:10:14,172 --> 00:10:15,589
you can come up with

217
00:10:15,623 --> 00:10:18,158
because we are doing
this assignment.

218
00:10:18,192 --> 00:10:20,844
And I'm gonna kick your ass.

219
00:10:31,437 --> 00:10:33,571
Well, well, well, I see

220
00:10:33,606 --> 00:10:35,490
that of Donkey Face's crap
is still here.

221
00:10:35,524 --> 00:10:37,075
And if Donkey Face's crap
is here,

222
00:10:37,109 --> 00:10:38,910
then that means that
he must be as well.

223
00:10:38,944 --> 00:10:40,361
Lay off of it,
Santana, all right?

224
00:10:40,395 --> 00:10:42,897
I told you, he said
that he got a job

225
00:10:42,915 --> 00:10:44,499
as a cater waiter on the side,

226
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:46,567
and he was embarrassed about it,
so he kept it a secret.

227
00:10:46,585 --> 00:10:48,586
Why? I mean, if he can
make that much cash

228
00:10:48,621 --> 00:10:50,905
slinging sweaty cold cuts

229
00:10:50,923 --> 00:10:53,574
and room temp champagne,
then we should all apply there.

230
00:10:53,592 --> 00:10:55,543
Hey, look, he's just trying
to make it in New York

231
00:10:55,577 --> 00:10:57,411
the same way that you and I are.

232
00:10:57,429 --> 00:10:59,430
I don't why that is so hard
for you to understand.

233
00:10:59,465 --> 00:11:01,299
You keep trying
to bring him down.

234
00:11:03,418 --> 00:11:06,387
Look, at this point it's less
about him than it is about you.

235
00:11:06,421 --> 00:11:08,056
I went to school
with Rachel Berry.

236
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:11,059
Not the soggy mess of a woman
that stands before me today,

237
00:11:11,093 --> 00:11:13,611
going back and forth between
your flop high school ex

238
00:11:13,646 --> 00:11:16,597
and that terrifying
"waiter with a pager."

239
00:11:18,984 --> 00:11:21,035
You need to stop
and focus, Berry.

240
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,403
I think you're wrong about him.

241
00:11:22,437 --> 00:11:25,707
My psychic Mexican third eye
is never wrong.

242
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:27,742
Am I wrong about you?

243
00:11:32,631 --> 00:11:35,616
BRODY:
♪ Oh, so typical

244
00:11:35,634 --> 00:11:38,586
♪ I'm the type
who will get so critical ♪

245
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,422
♪ So let's make

246
00:11:41,456 --> 00:11:42,924
♪ Things physical

247
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,626
♪ I won't treat you
like you're oh, so typical ♪

248
00:11:45,644 --> 00:11:47,645
(school bell rings)

249
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,480
(knocks on window) You!

250
00:11:49,515 --> 00:11:50,982
I know you're behind this.

251
00:11:51,016 --> 00:11:54,485
Sorry I yelled,
Gay Blaine, here.

252
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,155
Oh, Cover Boy hair gel.

253
00:11:57,189 --> 00:11:58,306
This is really expensive.

254
00:11:58,324 --> 00:11:59,607
Thanks, Becky.

255
00:11:59,641 --> 00:12:01,442
It's cement.

256
00:12:01,476 --> 00:12:02,577
(thuds)

257
00:12:02,611 --> 00:12:04,245
And someone took out
30 credit cards

258
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,080
and a house loan in my name.

259
00:12:06,115 --> 00:12:09,117
My identity's been stolen.
My parents' credit is ruined.

260
00:12:09,151 --> 00:12:10,668
Only for seven years.

261
00:12:10,703 --> 00:12:12,620
But that sign.

262
00:12:12,654 --> 00:12:13,955
That sign!

263
00:12:13,989 --> 00:12:15,990
(laughter)

264
00:12:19,328 --> 00:12:21,095
Come on.

265
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,464
That's completely inexcusable.

266
00:12:23,498 --> 00:12:25,016
And it's not true.

267
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,635
Not really... this officially
a feud between you and me.

268
00:12:27,669 --> 00:12:29,187
And there's only one way
to solve it.

269
00:12:29,221 --> 00:12:32,307
A sing-off featuring the music
of two feuding superstars?

270
00:12:32,341 --> 00:12:34,192
Oh, I read all about it

271
00:12:34,226 --> 00:12:36,110
in WhoGivesACrap.biz.

272
00:12:36,145 --> 00:12:38,980
Fine. Nicki Minaj
versus Mariah Carey.

273
00:12:39,014 --> 00:12:40,315
I will sing Nicki,

274
00:12:40,349 --> 00:12:41,983
due to my Trinidad roots.

275
00:12:42,017 --> 00:12:43,451
And if you win the challenge,

276
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:45,436
I'll tear up your
Cheerios! Contract.

277
00:12:45,471 --> 00:12:46,621
Fine, perfect.

278
00:12:46,655 --> 00:12:48,640
But that will never,
ever happen

279
00:12:48,691 --> 00:12:50,608
because you are looking
into the face of...

280
00:12:50,643 --> 00:12:52,259
Evil.

281
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:53,995
I was going to say
high school cheerleading

282
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:56,698
national champion,
but thank you.

283
00:12:56,732 --> 00:12:58,032
(school bell rings)

284
00:12:59,702 --> 00:13:01,619
(sighs)

285
00:13:01,654 --> 00:13:03,955
I don't think it's fair that
you're pissed at me about this.

286
00:13:03,989 --> 00:13:06,607
I didn't do anything.

287
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,126
You let him kiss you.

288
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,211
What was I supposed to do?

289
00:13:10,245 --> 00:13:12,279
It's not like he took
a running start.

290
00:13:12,298 --> 00:13:13,464
You're supposed
to not let him think

291
00:13:13,499 --> 00:13:14,949
that it was even a possibility.

292
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:17,585
Fine, I'll own that.

293
00:13:19,004 --> 00:13:20,338
I haven't minded the fact

294
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:21,639
that both of you are into me.

295
00:13:21,674 --> 00:13:23,474
And I certainly
didn't discourage him,

296
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:24,642
which wasn't fair to him

297
00:13:24,677 --> 00:13:26,177
or to you.

298
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,980
But are you telling me
that you've

299
00:13:29,014 --> 00:13:31,465
completely stopped flirting
with other girls?

300
00:13:31,483 --> 00:13:32,967
I would never do anything.

301
00:13:32,985 --> 00:13:35,236
So if some Cheerio you're
uncontrollably flirting with

302
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,971
suddenly decides to kiss you,
you're just gonna

303
00:13:36,989 --> 00:13:39,324
backflip out of the way
before her lips

304
00:13:39,358 --> 00:13:41,576
touch yours?

305
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,144
(both laugh)

306
00:13:43,162 --> 00:13:45,663
So what are we even
talking about here?

307
00:13:45,698 --> 00:13:48,583
Are you seriously worried that
I'm gonna leave you for Ryder?

308
00:13:49,618 --> 00:13:51,986
I don't know.
I mean, he kicked butt

309
00:13:52,004 --> 00:13:53,204
with all this
Valentine's Day stuff

310
00:13:53,255 --> 00:13:55,173
and he's like two inches taller
than what I am.

311
00:13:55,207 --> 00:13:56,424
(laughs):
I'm not.

312
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,542
I won't.

313
00:13:58,711 --> 00:14:01,512
I love you
and that means something to me.

314
00:14:01,547 --> 00:14:03,348
It's not just words.

315
00:14:03,382 --> 00:14:06,601
Well, are you afraid that
I'm gonna leave you for someone?

316
00:14:06,635 --> 00:14:08,519
Not as much anymore.

317
00:14:08,554 --> 00:14:10,888
Good.

318
00:14:10,939 --> 00:14:13,391
Because it's me and you
against the world.

319
00:14:14,643 --> 00:14:15,860
Especially Ryder.

320
00:14:15,894 --> 00:14:18,112
I mean, I thought he was
a good dude, but...

321
00:14:18,147 --> 00:14:19,447
he's not a friend.

322
00:14:19,481 --> 00:14:20,948
You need to ice him out.

323
00:14:20,983 --> 00:14:22,283
I can't do that.

324
00:14:23,152 --> 00:14:25,036
I mean, you can stay mad at him

325
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,622
if you want, but I have
to be more forgiving.

326
00:14:27,656 --> 00:14:28,906
How can you do that to me?

327
00:14:28,957 --> 00:14:30,691
It's gonna tick me off
every time I see you

328
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:32,577
talking to him.
Do you trust me?

329
00:14:32,628 --> 00:14:34,629
Do you believe that I love you?

330
00:14:34,663 --> 00:14:36,964
Yes, but...

331
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:38,633
Then it doesn't matter
who I talk to.

332
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:41,052
Because no matter
where I am or what I'm doing,

333
00:14:41,086 --> 00:14:43,554
I'm with you.

334
00:14:48,594 --> 00:14:51,229

Wow, guys, that was incredible.

388
00:17:00,392 --> 00:17:02,009
What inspired that mashup?

389
00:17:02,027 --> 00:17:03,510
I mean, the thing was feuds
so we just...

390
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:05,512
So Unique demanded mediation.

391
00:17:05,531 --> 00:17:08,616
Might I suggest doing an
Elton John/Madonna mashup?

392
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,401
Madonna finally forgave
Elton John for calling her

393
00:17:10,452 --> 00:17:11,452
"a fairground stripper"

394
00:17:11,486 --> 00:17:13,354
and saying that
her career was over,

395
00:17:13,372 --> 00:17:15,623
but their decade-long
feud was epic.

396
00:17:15,657 --> 00:17:18,292
Unique is, was, and ever
shall be Madonna.

397
00:17:18,327 --> 00:17:19,293
(laughs)

398
00:17:19,328 --> 00:17:21,546
He can try
to be Sir Elton, but...

399
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,014
you ain't got it.

400
00:17:23,048 --> 00:17:25,466
Well, the awesome things
about feuds is

401
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,552
that once all the anger
has gotten out,

402
00:17:27,586 --> 00:17:30,054
you can shake on it and
let bygones be bygones.

403
00:17:30,088 --> 00:17:33,040
Unique would happily shake
Ryder's hand, but first...

404
00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:34,559
say I'm a girl.

405
00:17:35,594 --> 00:17:37,595
(quiet laugh)

406
00:17:37,646 --> 00:17:40,264
Look, I'm just
so confused, okay?

407
00:17:40,315 --> 00:17:42,233
Yesterday you're dressed
as a boy; today you're a girl.

408
00:17:42,267 --> 00:17:43,651
What-what bathroom
do you use?

409
00:17:43,685 --> 00:17:44,986
I mean, make up your mind.

410
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,404
It doesn't matter what you see.

411
00:17:46,438 --> 00:17:48,606
You don't get to decide for me.

412
00:17:51,693 --> 00:17:54,561
You are a douchebag, dude.

413
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,998
I mean, in this room we can
be whatever we want to be.

414
00:17:59,952 --> 00:18:02,236
(school bell rings)

415
00:18:02,254 --> 00:18:03,504
SUE:
Becky, it's no secret

416
00:18:03,538 --> 00:18:06,591
(sniffs) you are
Nicki Minaj's biggest fan.

417
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:07,942
Minaj!

418
00:18:07,976 --> 00:18:09,510
Inside voice, Becky.

419
00:18:09,544 --> 00:18:11,128
I need your expert advice.

420
00:18:11,163 --> 00:18:12,263
Now I've got wigs in every shade

421
00:18:12,297 --> 00:18:13,514
of Jell-O,

422
00:18:13,548 --> 00:18:15,516
and costumes
from Lima's Circus Museum,

423
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,902
but if I am going
to win this feud...

424
00:18:17,936 --> 00:18:20,304
and I must win this feud...

425
00:18:20,355 --> 00:18:24,108
I can't just be a mere mirage
of Minaj, no.

426
00:18:24,142 --> 00:18:26,611
I must become her.

427
00:18:26,645 --> 00:18:29,280
Easy, Coach.
Practice your Minaj face.

428
00:18:29,314 --> 00:18:31,598
I think you said,
"Practice your Minaj face."

429
00:18:31,617 --> 00:18:33,200
Excellent.

430
00:18:41,493 --> 00:18:44,111
Great, moving on.
Most important...

431
00:18:44,129 --> 00:18:45,630
I'm one step ahead
of you, Becky.

432
00:18:45,664 --> 00:18:48,466
It's time to perfect my Nicki-
Minaj-where-the-hell-did-that...

433
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,384
come-from-cuckoo-
for-Cocoa-Puffs...

434
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:52,553
crazy-pants threat.

435
00:18:52,587 --> 00:18:53,554
(school bell rings)

436
00:18:53,588 --> 00:18:55,589
I'm not putting up
with Your Highness.

437
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,977
It's off with your head.

438
00:19:00,012 --> 00:19:01,896
Don't you call me a gangster.
What?

439
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,630
Every time you patronize me,

440
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:06,067
I will take it back.

441
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:06,901
Leave me alone.

442
00:19:06,935 --> 00:19:08,569
I will knock you out.

443
00:19:10,439 --> 00:19:11,856
Getting there, Coach.

444
00:19:14,325 --> 00:19:16,651
BRODY: Five, six,
seven, eight.

445
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,977
Two, four,

446
00:19:18,995 --> 00:19:20,979
six...

447
00:19:20,997 --> 00:19:23,281
Come on, guys, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, please.

448
00:19:23,315 --> 00:19:25,667
This is not gonna cut it
with Cassie, okay?

449
00:19:25,701 --> 00:19:27,285
Let's do it from the top.

450
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:28,820
Just don't get
too close, girls.

451
00:19:28,838 --> 00:19:29,754
Unless you're immune

452
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:31,756
to the herps.

453
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,317
Take five.

454
00:19:34,362 --> 00:19:36,196
How did you get in here?

455
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,814
Don't apply logic to Lopez.

456
00:19:37,865 --> 00:19:39,199
And if what I just saw
is any indication,

457
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:40,984
I can get in here
any time I want.

458
00:19:41,035 --> 00:19:43,119
I've got moves your
mannequin ass couldn't handle.

459
00:19:43,154 --> 00:19:45,071
Do you know what
your problem is, Santana?

460
00:19:45,105 --> 00:19:46,990
You're loud and you're rude,

461
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,159
and you think
that attitude equals talent.

462
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,711
Another thing I am:
A hardcore friend.

463
00:19:51,746 --> 00:19:53,997
Rachel and Kurt are my family,

464
00:19:54,048 --> 00:19:55,382
and I can smell
your sketchiness from here.

465
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,050
So let me tell you
how it's gonna be.

466
00:19:57,084 --> 00:19:59,386
You're gonna move out
of our apartment tonight

467
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,756
or I can dig a little deeper
and destroy you.

468
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,790
You're all talk and no proof.

469
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:04,791
Don't need proof.

470
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:06,426
I know exactly what you are.

471
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,012
Yo, fly girls, can
I get some backup?

472
00:20:09,063 --> 00:20:10,847
If you're any kind of dancer,
this one should be

473
00:20:10,898 --> 00:20:12,899
in your bones.

There's nothing I can do or say
to win back your trust.

Hopefully it bodes better
for me

608
00:26:15,634 --> 00:26:17,668

Santana, if you'd just take
a seat, please

610
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:21,606
and join us for a little
family loft conversation.

611

We just got off the phone

614
00:26:27,345 --> 00:26:28,696
with Brody.

615
00:26:28,731 --> 00:26:30,631
Did you confront him

616
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:33,284
at NYADA with a
Paula Abdul song?

617
00:26:33,318 --> 00:26:34,202
You can't just

618
00:26:34,236 --> 00:26:35,686
march on in there

619
00:26:35,704 --> 00:26:37,288
and like, act all crazy, okay?

620
00:26:37,322 --> 00:26:38,706
We go to school there.

621
00:26:38,741 --> 00:26:41,392
That was the best performance
that place has seen in years.

622
00:26:44,246 --> 00:26:46,364
We want you to move out.

623
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:49,133
You're joking.

624
00:26:49,168 --> 00:26:50,118
We're not.

625
00:26:50,152 --> 00:26:51,335
(sirens wailing in distance)

626
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,337
Olsen twins,
let me tell you something.

627
00:26:53,371 --> 00:26:55,223
I have known you both
for years,

628
00:26:55,257 --> 00:26:57,308
and I don't like either of you
90% of the time.

629
00:26:57,342 --> 00:27:00,044
In fact, your wide-eyed,
Keane painting approach of life

630
00:27:00,062 --> 00:27:03,848
makes my teeth hurt
and my breasts ache with rage,

631
00:27:03,882 --> 00:27:06,234
but you know what,
I have love for you.

632
00:27:07,219 --> 00:27:08,719
You're my family,

633
00:27:08,737 --> 00:27:10,188
and I haven't lied to you
in months.

634
00:27:10,222 --> 00:27:12,023
I'm smarter about other people
than the both of you.

635
00:27:12,057 --> 00:27:13,324
You have to trust me.

636
00:27:13,358 --> 00:27:15,860
Santana, you're making Brody
feel uncomfortable, okay?

637
00:27:15,894 --> 00:27:18,329
And he was here first,
so you either lay off of it

638
00:27:18,363 --> 00:27:19,396
or you move out.

639
00:27:21,617 --> 00:27:23,668
Fine.

640
00:27:23,702 --> 00:27:25,036
That's fine.

641
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,904
You know what, I don't...
I don't mind going.

642
00:27:26,922 --> 00:27:29,006
I ran into Lena Dunham

643
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:30,708
at Barney's,

644
00:27:30,742 --> 00:27:33,094
and she told me
that I could crash with her

645
00:27:33,128 --> 00:27:35,096
if I ever needed to,
so that's cool

646
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,848
'cause she has
two Golden Globes.

647
00:27:36,882 --> 00:27:39,250
Oh, you know what,
and another thing.

649
00:27:43,772 --> 00:27:45,422
I'm right about plastic man.

650
00:27:57,386 --> 00:27:59,220
I'm pretty sure
she just stole my comforter.

And that, ladies, gays,
and in-betweeners,

745
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:53,521
and hag for life,

746
00:31:53,556 --> 00:31:54,839
is how it's done.

747
00:31:54,857 --> 00:31:56,274
Impressive, Sue, both of you.

748
00:31:56,308 --> 00:31:58,142
But Coach Sylvester used like,

749
00:31:58,176 --> 00:31:59,844
feathers and a black light,

750
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:02,113
and she brought in the Cheerios.
Yeah, that's not fair.

751
00:32:02,147 --> 00:32:04,315
Yes, but nobody ever said
life is fair, Tina.

752
00:32:04,349 --> 00:32:05,867
So, William,

753
00:32:05,901 --> 00:32:07,936
though it's shockingly clear
who the winner is,

754
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,520
would you do the honors,

755
00:32:09,538 --> 00:32:11,372
and unlike that interminably
long voting montage

756
00:32:11,407 --> 00:32:12,790
at the end of <i>Lincoln,</i>

757
00:32:12,825 --> 00:32:14,125
let's make this fast.

758
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,212
Show of hands for
Blaine as Mariah.

759
00:32:17,246 --> 00:32:18,379
Thank you, Tina.

760
00:32:18,414 --> 00:32:19,530
Come on.

761
00:32:19,548 --> 00:32:20,364
Noted.

762
00:32:20,382 --> 00:32:23,034
All in favor of Sue as Nicki?

763
00:32:23,052 --> 00:32:24,802
(chuckles)

764
00:32:24,837 --> 00:32:27,805
Well, I hope you're ready
for some form-fitting polyester,

765
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,007
gay Clark Kent

766
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:30,475
from season one of <i>Smallville,</i>

767
00:32:30,509 --> 00:32:32,477
because it looks like
you're going to be the bottom

768
00:32:32,511 --> 00:32:36,397
of my Cheerios pyramid
after all.

769
00:32:39,518 --> 00:32:41,519
(school bell ringing)

770
00:32:53,565 --> 00:32:55,950
So you really are leaving?

771
00:32:57,069 --> 00:32:58,336
(sighs)

772
00:32:58,370 --> 00:32:59,454
Yeah.

773
00:33:02,407 --> 00:33:04,842
I just wanted to thank you
for everything

774
00:33:04,877 --> 00:33:06,761
you did for me.

775
00:33:12,417 --> 00:33:13,584
Thank you.

776
00:33:16,254 --> 00:33:17,221
So...

777
00:33:17,255 --> 00:33:18,523
what's next for you?

778
00:33:18,557 --> 00:33:20,108
I don't know.

779
00:33:20,142 --> 00:33:21,425
Probably a lot of long hours

780
00:33:21,443 --> 00:33:22,927
of figuring out
what's next for me.

781
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,450
MARLEY:
Um...

782
00:33:30,986 --> 00:33:32,287
Can I speak freely?

783
00:33:32,321 --> 00:33:35,773
Yeah, sure, I'm not your
commanding officer or anything.

784
00:33:35,791 --> 00:33:37,075
Say whatever you want.

785
00:33:37,109 --> 00:33:40,378
Dude, you really need
to grow a pair.

786
00:33:40,412 --> 00:33:43,131
Maybe you should go back
to not speaking so freely.

787
00:33:43,165 --> 00:33:44,299
I know that

788
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:46,134
you're feeling bad about
yourself right now.

789
00:33:46,168 --> 00:33:48,252
And I also know
how just one kiss

790
00:33:48,286 --> 00:33:50,221
can get you into
a whole lot of trouble.

791
00:33:50,255 --> 00:33:51,556
Believe me.

792
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:55,259
But if Mr. Shue doesn't want you
around anymore, forget him.

793
00:33:55,293 --> 00:33:57,428
Don't let him define you.

794
00:33:57,462 --> 00:33:59,814
Problem is, he does define me.

795
00:33:59,848 --> 00:34:03,267
The four years I spent
in this Glee Club

796
00:34:03,301 --> 00:34:04,936
defines me.

797
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:06,738
This whole freakin' school
defines me,

798
00:34:06,772 --> 00:34:08,156
and without it, I am...

799
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,441
I just feel... lost.

800
00:34:10,475 --> 00:34:11,492
So...

801
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:13,761
After we lost Sectionals, I was

802
00:34:13,796 --> 00:34:15,079
terrified

803
00:34:15,114 --> 00:34:16,898
that everything was
just going to fall apart,

804
00:34:16,932 --> 00:34:18,315
but you fought

805
00:34:18,334 --> 00:34:20,001
to keep us together.

806
00:34:20,035 --> 00:34:21,452
You're a natural leader, Finn.

807
00:34:21,486 --> 00:34:23,788
A teacher.

808
00:34:23,822 --> 00:34:26,090
You don't need
Mr. Shue's approval to be that.

809
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:27,091
Yeah,

810
00:34:27,126 --> 00:34:28,159
but I do need a little thing

811
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:29,160
called a teaching degree.

812
00:34:29,178 --> 00:34:30,962
So...

813
00:34:31,964 --> 00:34:33,497
...go get one.

814
00:34:43,767 --> 00:34:45,768
(school bell ringing)

815
00:34:47,071 --> 00:34:48,488
(sighs)

816
00:34:48,522 --> 00:34:49,972
You gonna challenge
all three of us to a feud now?

817
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:52,108
Look, I asked you guys here
for a truce.

818
00:34:53,494 --> 00:34:54,477
Okay, sometimes

819
00:34:54,495 --> 00:34:55,862
I don't know how to fit in here.

820
00:34:57,047 --> 00:34:58,981
But kissing you, Marley...

821
00:34:58,999 --> 00:35:00,650
that was so out of line,
and I'm sorry.

822
00:35:00,684 --> 00:35:01,984
It's okay.

823
00:35:02,002 --> 00:35:04,954
It's not, but...
I'll never do it again.

824
00:35:06,924 --> 00:35:09,208
Look, friendship is about trust.

825
00:35:09,259 --> 00:35:10,993
Okay? It's like
when we're playing football.

826
00:35:11,011 --> 00:35:13,346
Look, I fumbled
the ball this time,

827
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,548
but you know I have good hands.

828
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,683
I just made a mistake.

829
00:35:16,717 --> 00:35:18,017
You know

830
00:35:18,052 --> 00:35:19,385
if you give me the ball again,

831
00:35:19,436 --> 00:35:20,553
I won't let you down.

832
00:35:25,275 --> 00:35:27,343
Yeah, but it might take
a little while.

833
00:35:27,361 --> 00:35:28,344
I take that.

834
00:35:28,362 --> 00:35:29,729
Thank you.

835
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,730
(sighs)

836
00:35:30,781 --> 00:35:32,365
Unique...

837
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:34,683
Look, I'm not gonna pretend
like I understand everything

838
00:35:34,702 --> 00:35:35,785
that's going on with you.

839
00:35:35,819 --> 00:35:37,236
(sighs)

840
00:35:37,271 --> 00:35:39,021
But you have a truth,

841
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,356
and as your friend,

842
00:35:40,391 --> 00:35:41,941
I need to support
that truth, so...

843
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:43,493
you're a girl, dude.

844
00:35:44,945 --> 00:35:47,063
Holy crap, did I mess that up?

845
00:35:47,097 --> 00:35:48,130
No, it's just...

846
00:35:49,516 --> 00:35:51,434
That day, after we sang...

847
00:35:51,468 --> 00:35:54,771
I decided to walk home
in all my Leslie Uggams glory,

848
00:35:54,805 --> 00:35:57,824
<i>and a group of popular girls</i>
<i>came after me.</i>

849
00:35:57,858 --> 00:35:58,941
GIRL 1: ...serious?
Look at this.

850
00:35:58,975 --> 00:36:00,993
Are you a boy or a girl?

851
00:36:01,028 --> 00:36:03,279
Hey! Freak!

852
00:36:03,313 --> 00:36:05,147
Lady Freak!

853
00:36:05,165 --> 00:36:06,949
I got home before
they caught up to me,

854
00:36:06,983 --> 00:36:08,985
but I was so scared.

855
00:36:09,019 --> 00:36:10,653
I'm walking you home
from now on.

856
00:36:10,671 --> 00:36:11,671
Yeah. Me, too.

857
00:36:11,705 --> 00:36:13,339
Me, three. KITTY: Me, four.

858
00:36:13,373 --> 00:36:15,324
And P.S., do those bitches
go to this school?

859
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:16,826
'Cause if so,
I want their names

860
00:36:16,844 --> 00:36:18,327
so I can put Nair
in their shampoo bottles.

861
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:20,329
Wait a minute. We're friends?
Look,

862
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:22,014
I don't know if it's 'cause
I've been dating Puckerman,

863
00:36:22,049 --> 00:36:24,434
which makes it really hard
to judge anyone...

864
00:36:24,468 --> 00:36:26,753
and I will deny it
outside in the real world...

865
00:36:26,787 --> 00:36:28,087
but, yes.

866
00:36:28,122 --> 00:36:29,088
We're friends.

867
00:36:29,123 --> 00:36:30,423
And we're in this together.

868
00:36:30,457 --> 00:36:31,507
I'm a winner,

869
00:36:31,542 --> 00:36:32,642
and I want to win Regionals.

870
00:36:32,676 --> 00:36:34,009
So we need to cut the crap

871
00:36:34,027 --> 00:36:35,111
and the fighting

872
00:36:35,145 --> 00:36:36,512
and tighten up
so we can win this.

873
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:39,031
Friendships are tested
like this all the time.

874
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:40,366
And the ones that are real

875
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,868
are the ones
that pass the test.

876
00:36:41,902 --> 00:36:43,786
Artie and Tina and Sam
and probably Brittany

877
00:36:43,821 --> 00:36:45,455
are all going to be gone
next year,

878
00:36:45,489 --> 00:36:46,773
and it's going to be up to us

879
00:36:46,807 --> 00:36:48,441
to keep up the Glee Club torch.

880
00:36:48,475 --> 00:36:50,710
Not just winning
competitions, but...

881
00:36:50,744 --> 00:36:53,796
the legacy of being
the only place at this school...

882
00:36:53,831 --> 00:36:55,465
at any school...

883
00:36:55,499 --> 00:36:56,999
where the most special thing
you can be is yourself.

884
00:36:57,033 --> 00:36:58,801
Think we're up for it?

885
00:36:58,836 --> 00:36:59,869
Are you kidding?

886
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:01,838
This place ain't seen
nothing yet.

887
00:37:01,872 --> 00:37:03,306
Yeah!
Oh, yeah...

888
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:06,041
(laughing)

889
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:08,060
(school bell ringing)

890
00:37:08,095 --> 00:37:11,013
SUE:
You look absolutely

891
00:37:11,047 --> 00:37:12,047
adorable.

892
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:13,349
And just to show there's

893
00:37:13,383 --> 00:37:14,684
no animosity between us,

894
00:37:14,718 --> 00:37:16,051
I've decided to make
you and Becky

895
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:17,987
my Cheerios!
Co-captains.

896
00:37:18,021 --> 00:37:19,405
Yes!

897
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:22,057
I love you.

898
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:23,359
Thank you.
(Sue whistles)

899
00:37:23,393 --> 00:37:25,912
Let this be a life
lesson to you...

900
00:37:25,946 --> 00:37:28,397
one that you'll remember
20 years from now,

901
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:29,899
when you're playing
"Uncle Nubbins"

902
00:37:29,933 --> 00:37:32,001
on <i>The Suite Life of</i>
<i>Zack and Cody</i> reboot...

903
00:37:32,035 --> 00:37:34,337
that the real world is nothing
like the Glee Club,

904
00:37:34,371 --> 00:37:36,405
where you can join and rejoin,

905
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:38,007
quit and requit

906
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:39,675
whenever you're not crying

907
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,377
or throwing confetti
at each other.

908
00:37:41,411 --> 00:37:43,830
Because in the real world,
there are commitments...

909
00:37:43,864 --> 00:37:46,065
and you're only as good
as your word.

910
00:37:50,053 --> 00:37:51,938
Blaine Devon Anderson,

911
00:37:51,972 --> 00:37:54,557
do I have your word
that you are

912
00:37:54,591 --> 00:37:56,692
fully committed to my team?

913
00:37:56,727 --> 00:37:57,894
What? She can't hear you!

914
00:37:57,928 --> 00:38:00,112
Yes, Coach Sylvester.

915
00:38:00,147 --> 00:38:02,565
All right.

916
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:04,433
Gymnasium, 3:05.

917
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:06,769
Oh, a little trick
of the trade...

918
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:08,571
from now on, wear a thong

919
00:38:08,605 --> 00:38:10,656
to avoid visible panty lines.

920
00:38:12,993 --> 00:38:14,961
(sighs)

921
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:30,643
How'd it go?

922
00:38:30,677 --> 00:38:31,928
Exactly as planned.

923
00:38:31,962 --> 00:38:33,062
I'm gonna work from the inside

924
00:38:33,096 --> 00:38:34,597
and bring her down.

925
00:38:34,631 --> 00:38:35,731
By the time we graduate,

926
00:38:35,766 --> 00:38:36,933
Sue Sylvester's reign of terror

927
00:38:36,967 --> 00:38:38,100
will finally be over.

928
00:38:38,135 --> 00:38:40,019
Excellent!

929
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:56,035
Good evening, Vicky.

930
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:01,357
Santana. How did you...

931
00:39:01,391 --> 00:39:02,992
I told you.
This is what I do.

932
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,293
You can't tell Rachel.

933
00:39:04,327 --> 00:39:06,345
Please, I'm not proud of this.

934
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,496
Save it.

935
00:39:07,514 --> 00:39:08,864
I think there's someone
more important

936
00:39:08,899 --> 00:39:10,016
that you should convince
tonight.

937
00:39:15,672 --> 00:39:16,772
Okay.

938
00:39:16,807 --> 00:39:19,025
Well, I am going
to leave you two alone

939
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:20,443
for a little girl talk.

940
00:39:20,477 --> 00:39:21,477
Have fun.

941
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,727
Listen, I can explain this.
Shut your mouth.

942
00:39:31,761 --> 00:39:33,228
After tonight...

943
00:39:33,263 --> 00:39:34,713
you're a ghost.

944
00:39:34,731 --> 00:39:37,215
You disappear
from her life forever.

945
00:39:37,233 --> 00:39:39,017
No good-byes, nothing.

946
00:39:39,051 --> 00:39:40,319
I love her.

947
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,908
But she doesn't really even know
who you are.

948
00:39:47,443 --> 00:39:48,443
Yet.

949
00:39:50,747 --> 00:39:51,947
You can't tell her.

950
00:39:51,998 --> 00:39:53,415

951
00:39:55,668 --> 00:39:57,002
