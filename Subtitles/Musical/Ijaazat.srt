1
00:03:11,638 --> 00:03:16,200
Porter!

2
00:03:21,715 --> 00:03:24,775
It had to rain today!
I won't even get a porter now.

3
00:03:27,787 --> 00:03:31,223
- Porter, sir? - Ah, yes.
I've to go to the Waiting Room.

4
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:35,925
- 1st class? - Is there one?
- Yes, come on. - Go ahead.

5
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:11,093
I've no change, sir.

6
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:18,029
- Keep it, wake me for the train.
- The Express? - Yes, 7:30 A.M.

7
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:24,075
- Any canteen here?
- Yes. You get cold tea.

8
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:28,274
- Cold tea?
- I mean cold drinks and tea.

9
00:04:29,516 --> 00:04:33,282
- Shall I send some tea?
- Yes, send the waiter. - Right.

10
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:50,964
Good boy! Eat the biscuit.
We'll go home and have dinner.

11
00:05:54,734 --> 00:05:58,534
- Any separate Ladies Waiting Room?
- Only one 1st Class Waiting Room.

12
00:05:58,872 --> 00:06:03,036
It's for both, Ladies and Gents.
There's another one, but very dirty.

13
00:06:03,576 --> 00:06:07,376
But why don't you sit here
and be comfortable? Don't worry.

14
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:10,376
Because our staff is on duty
the whole night.

15
00:06:59,332 --> 00:07:02,665
The key. Where did I keep it?

16
00:07:26,126 --> 00:07:29,789
- What are you looking at?
- Your suitcase. - Why?

17
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,131
I've lost my key, so I wondered
if this was a V.I.P. Brand too.

18
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:36,735
- Their keys are common to all.
- No. Mine is a different make.

19
00:07:45,345 --> 00:07:49,475
That's a V.I.P. And the key will
fit. - It belongs to a lady.

20
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:52,747
She has gone out.
Request her when she comes.

21
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,172
- What is it, Sudha?
- Open the door. What are you doing?

22
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:27,349
- What will I do in a Dark Room?
Developing a photo. - Whose?

23
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,425
- A girl's. - Which girl?
- The girl I married 2 months ago.

24
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:19,402
Come along. The car's here.
Uncle's come too, to take you.

25
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,750
So, sir? Didn't the bag open?

26
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:36,584
Did you ask her for the key?

27
00:09:39,592 --> 00:09:43,153
Why feel so awkward, sir?

28
00:09:43,463 --> 00:09:47,297
People are expected to help in
a journey. Excuse me, Madam...

29
00:09:49,535 --> 00:09:51,469
This man has lost his key.

30
00:09:51,771 --> 00:09:55,764
He has a V.I.P. Too, so your
key may fit. Please give him.

31
00:09:56,276 --> 00:09:58,267
It may be useful to him.

32
00:11:17,957 --> 00:11:20,357
Where has he gone? Madam,
was there a gentleman here?

33
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:22,187
Yes, He's having a wash.

34
00:11:25,198 --> 00:11:29,294
- What is it? - Nothing, Ma'am.
- I told you he's having a wash.

35
00:11:29,702 --> 00:11:33,365
- Has he ordered tea?
- Yes. Bring it when he comes out.

36
00:11:36,242 --> 00:11:39,700
As if I'm his watchman!
If I hadn't been here now, then?

37
00:12:08,474 --> 00:12:13,741
- Tea, sir. - Why two?
- Madam told me. Thought she'd...

38
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,274
Okay, You may go.

39
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,646
I just told him to get the tea.

40
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:32,593
Since he has brought it,
might as well drink it.

41
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,758
You know I don't take tea.

42
00:12:38,004 --> 00:12:41,770
Yes, I do know it.
But he has brought it.

43
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:44,767
You used to have it once.

44
00:12:49,782 --> 00:12:51,773
Shall I make it for you?

45
00:12:53,786 --> 00:12:55,617
I'll make it.

46
00:13:04,964 --> 00:13:06,955
- One spoon of sugar, right?
- No, no sugar.

47
00:13:08,868 --> 00:13:13,601
- Since when?
- Five years now.

48
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,071
Yes, since that time.

49
00:13:30,756 --> 00:13:33,486
- Where had you been?
- Patna.

50
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:43,294
- Do you still teach?
- Yes I do.

51
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:48,000
- Music?
- Yes.

52
00:14:04,624 --> 00:14:08,685
- When did you start wearing glasses?
- About 21/2 years now.

53
00:14:10,796 --> 00:14:14,027
They suit you. You look matured.

54
00:14:16,969 --> 00:14:20,530
- Wasn't I mature 5 years back?
- You were.

55
00:14:21,741 --> 00:14:23,402
But now you look wiser!

56
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:29,612
- When did you grow a beard?
- Some days now.

57
00:14:32,785 --> 00:14:34,377
Why? Don't I look matured?

58
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:46,723
- How come you're here?
- I had been on a campaign.

59
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:52,066
- Going back now.
- Where?

60
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,902
- Home!
- Do you still live there?

61
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:05,517
Yes, there. The same city.

62
00:15:06,052 --> 00:15:08,384
The same lane. The same house.

63
00:15:13,826 --> 00:15:15,726
Everything is...

64
00:15:18,264 --> 00:15:24,169
Everything isn't the same. But
it's there. At the same place.

65
00:15:45,725 --> 00:15:49,821
- My respects, Grandpa. - Bless you.
So you've come! Go have a bath.

66
00:15:50,963 --> 00:15:54,956
- I'll have a wash at home.
- Animals are washed, son.

67
00:15:55,134 --> 00:15:58,968
Humans have a bath!
No Holy Thread either, eh?

68
00:15:59,372 --> 00:16:03,138
Wear one, son. Who'll tell
you to wear one after me?

69
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:06,639
I've but a few days.
Once I die...

70
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:09,814
...who'll do my last rites?
So wear a Holy thread, okay?

71
00:16:13,986 --> 00:16:16,716
- How's your car running?
- It doesn't run at all.

72
00:16:16,989 --> 00:16:21,585
- It just troubles me, that's all.
- But it's a Vintage. - My foot!

73
00:16:21,761 --> 00:16:25,356
It's just a nuisance! Hey, hey...

74
00:16:25,998 --> 00:16:30,492
- But I've brushed my teeth.
- At least wash your hands now.

75
00:16:37,476 --> 00:16:42,345
- Good, eh? Sweet? - Yes.
- Keep a box from our garden.

76
00:16:42,882 --> 00:16:47,182
- It'll go waste. I'm hardly home.
- Do you live in the studio?

77
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:52,013
I've to go in the hilly terrain
for campaigns. - You're all set?

78
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:08,434
Come, Parvati. Son-in-law's here.
I called him. Don't complain later.

79
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,734
- I never say anything.
- Now ask him what you want to.

80
00:17:11,911 --> 00:17:16,211
- What will I ask him?
- Okay, sit down. You tell me...

81
00:17:16,482 --> 00:17:21,044
...next month is auspicious, but
ask him it he's prepared or not.

82
00:17:22,822 --> 00:17:26,918
You better ask him. I've been
waiting for 5 years.

83
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,694
Did you hear that?
And she's quite right.

84
00:17:32,198 --> 00:17:36,635
5 years is a long time to wait.
At first, you were studying.

85
00:17:37,136 --> 00:17:42,267
We educated the girl. Then when
you opened a shop, we agreed.

86
00:17:43,075 --> 00:17:46,738
I was never for an
early marriage. Never!

87
00:17:47,346 --> 00:17:50,611
Two years went by.
Sudha took up a job.

88
00:17:51,951 --> 00:17:55,614
- She teaches at Panchgani.
You know that, don't you? - Yes.

89
00:18:04,897 --> 00:18:10,096
- Talk in Hindi. What are you
talking about? - Nothing really.

90
00:18:10,302 --> 00:18:14,102
- Just asking if he's involved...
...then what about Sudha?

91
00:18:14,273 --> 00:18:19,108
- 5 years now... - Don't worry.
You also ask her when she comes.

92
00:18:20,112 --> 00:18:21,943
What's there to ask her?

93
00:18:23,115 --> 00:18:25,515
She respects you so very much.

94
00:18:27,987 --> 00:18:33,118
Whatever you say, is greater
to her. Than even me!

95
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:41,395
Don't start that now.
I'm also very proud of her.

96
00:18:42,001 --> 00:18:45,903
I respect her more, than my own
grandson here. Tell her...

97
00:18:46,205 --> 00:18:48,673
...we won't change the date now.
That's it!

98
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:53,801
- You said the 7th inst., right?
- Yes.

99
00:18:55,147 --> 00:18:57,638
- 7th of next month?
- Yes.

100
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:03,315
- That's just 8 days from today!
- So? What have you to do?

101
00:19:03,956 --> 00:19:05,685
Just come and sit in the pandal.

102
00:19:07,193 --> 00:19:11,857
- I hate fuss of any kind. - But
Grandpa... - You can't come earlier.

103
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:15,694
Come on the 6th. The marriage
is on the next day.

104
00:19:15,968 --> 00:19:18,698
I'll attend to it myself.
Recite the mantras myself.

105
00:19:33,185 --> 00:19:35,915
- You should've told your Grandpa.
- I didn't have the guts.

106
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:43,656
When we got engaged there was
nobody. I met Maya 2 years ago.

107
00:19:44,964 --> 00:19:48,866
And if she's in town,
there has never been a day...

108
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:55,037
...when we haven't been together.
We're not officially married, else...

109
00:19:56,208 --> 00:20:01,339
What I mean is, we've
lived together.

110
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,211
What do you want me to do?

111
00:20:11,223 --> 00:20:14,886
- Can't this marriage...
...not take place?

112
00:20:15,427 --> 00:20:20,228
Cancel it? Meaning I'm to say
that I've found somebody else?

113
00:20:24,637 --> 00:20:28,095
Actually I was hoping this would
happen for the past 2 years!

114
00:20:30,242 --> 00:20:33,700
You're independent. Away from home.

115
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:38,242
You live alone too. And...

116
00:20:39,151 --> 00:20:41,949
...as it is, you're... I mean...
- You mean...

117
00:20:42,655 --> 00:20:44,748
I'm beautiful, Right?

118
00:20:46,258 --> 00:20:51,252
What's the use? Since you don't
like me, how will anybody else?

119
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:55,833
Don't say that, please.
I'm feeling guilty as it is.

120
00:20:57,436 --> 00:20:59,597
That's why I came, and,
was so honest with you.

121
00:21:01,273 --> 00:21:05,801
- Of course, Grandpa will kill me...
- And Mom will die of shock!

122
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:08,544
You don't know her.

123
00:21:12,217 --> 00:21:15,744
Then? What shall I do?

124
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:23,021
Listen to me. Don't
try to control life.

125
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:25,755
It will not turn even if
you try to turn it!

126
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,564
I'm a typical teacher, aren't I?

127
00:21:32,905 --> 00:21:39,242
- Look. Do what is honest and right.
- Meaning?

128
00:21:40,846 --> 00:21:44,839
Take Maya and go
straight to Grandpa.

129
00:21:46,251 --> 00:21:50,847
- And do as he says.
- And supposing he...

130
00:21:51,457 --> 00:21:56,121
He won't force you.
I'm sure of that.

131
00:21:57,329 --> 00:21:59,797
Grandpa didn't rear just you.

132
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,829
I too grew up around him.

133
00:22:06,038 --> 00:22:09,701
And... your mother?

134
00:22:13,278 --> 00:22:17,339
She was Grandpa's responsibility.
He'll do the same now.

135
00:22:46,712 --> 00:22:50,045
- Yes, sir?
- Had anyone come?

136
00:22:50,382 --> 00:22:53,840
Maya Madam was here.
But she was in a hurry.

137
00:22:54,520 --> 00:23:00,049
- She took some things and left.
- Say anything? - She left a note.

138
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:31,415
- Where's the note?
- Don't know. She just told me.

139
00:23:32,257 --> 00:23:35,920
- But where did she go?
- Does she ever tell? You know her.

140
00:23:36,328 --> 00:23:38,159
Always in a hurry she is!

141
00:24:23,942 --> 00:24:26,069
- When did you come back?
- Just now.

142
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:29,473
- I was trying to phone you.
- Coffee? Where's Maya?

143
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:33,107
- Want some coffee?
- Where's Maya?

144
00:24:51,436 --> 00:24:55,167
Sometimes, as I walk, my
shadow on the ground...

145
00:24:57,176 --> 00:25:01,169
...stands before me, holds
my hand and says...

146
00:25:02,247 --> 00:25:04,909
This time I'll walk ahead

147
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,683
And you follow me,
and see what happens

148
00:25:11,723 --> 00:25:15,853
I waiting for you. Maya said,
when you come back...

149
00:25:16,528 --> 00:25:19,326
...you'll definitely meet me.
- Where has she gone? When?

150
00:25:20,098 --> 00:25:24,364
- 2 days after you left.
- But where? - Does she ever tell?

151
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,203
- And when will she return?
- Didn't tell that either.

152
00:25:32,778 --> 00:25:36,441
She doesn't know it herself!
You know how it is.

153
00:25:36,882 --> 00:25:40,374
Last time she was away for
3-4 months! Before that...

154
00:25:40,552 --> 00:25:45,114
...that time she had gone home.
- Home? She doesn't have one!

155
00:25:51,897 --> 00:25:56,561
That's where she escapes from!
Even her parents are fed-up!

156
00:25:57,569 --> 00:26:02,268
They washed their hands of her the
day she joined the Film Institute.

157
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,309
Where will I search for her now?

158
00:26:12,918 --> 00:26:16,046
You won't find her.
She's made like that.

159
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:20,925
The way she came to me,
she dropped, in your life too.

160
00:26:22,494 --> 00:26:24,928
In her own words... Mona...

161
00:26:25,764 --> 00:26:29,200
I flew like a dry leaf, and
got caught in Mahender's collar.

162
00:26:31,003 --> 00:26:35,201
She has stayed put for such a long
period only after meeting you.

163
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:40,277
Mona, if she doesn't return in
1-2 days, it'll be the end!

164
00:26:41,413 --> 00:26:43,142
Why? What'll happen?

165
00:26:45,617 --> 00:26:51,021
- Marriage! - With whom?
- Sudha of course.

166
00:26:57,162 --> 00:27:00,154
- What is it?
- What are you doing? Open up.

167
00:27:00,532 --> 00:27:04,195
What else can I do in here?
I'm developing photographs.

168
00:27:05,437 --> 00:27:08,895
- Whose photos? - A girl's.
- Which girl?

169
00:27:09,374 --> 00:27:12,434
The girl I married
just 2 months back!

170
00:27:14,212 --> 00:27:17,807
- I don't want it!
- What? The photo or the marriage?

171
00:27:18,383 --> 00:27:22,444
- Open the door at least.
- Come on in.

172
00:27:24,656 --> 00:27:28,490
Here you are. Your
Wedding Photographs.

173
00:27:29,594 --> 00:27:32,654
- That Ram Gopal has to be paid.
- Give him money from my wallet.

174
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:35,659
- Where is it?
- There it is.

175
00:27:46,411 --> 00:27:50,347
- You give it to me. Rs. 40.
- Why? Take it yourself.

176
00:27:57,422 --> 00:28:00,687
I may seem petty minded.
But I'm like that.

177
00:28:01,693 --> 00:28:04,423
Possessive and selfish too.

178
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:11,533
Please don't feel bad.
I know, that...

179
00:28:11,703 --> 00:28:17,107
...she has left a strong impression
in this house which has been erased.

180
00:28:19,177 --> 00:28:23,580
She may lurk in some odd corner now
but she'll go away from there too.

181
00:28:25,717 --> 00:28:27,981
I am not asking you
to drive her away.

182
00:28:29,121 --> 00:28:32,716
But I feel everything is
being shared in this house.

183
00:28:33,592 --> 00:28:37,187
Whatever I touch, I feel as though
I'm touching someone else's things.

184
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:41,229
Nothing seems to belong
solely to me!

185
00:28:47,606 --> 00:28:51,940
Where has he gone?
Here's your money.

186
00:28:54,246 --> 00:28:58,649
Yes? Which 10/-? Is it?

187
00:28:59,818 --> 00:29:03,754
Why didn't you say before?
Tell me what you brought.

188
00:29:06,258 --> 00:29:12,925
It's 10/-, isn't it?
You're sure about it?

189
00:29:13,598 --> 00:29:18,035
Okay, right.
You wait here I'll get it.

190
00:29:20,872 --> 00:29:22,772
Listen, I need 10/- more...

191
00:29:49,601 --> 00:29:51,592
Wait! Take the money and go.

192
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:59,806
This is for the tea.
And keep the change. Go.

193
00:30:01,246 --> 00:30:05,979
By the way, will I get
anything to eat here?

194
00:30:06,218 --> 00:30:09,710
- Everything is closed now, sir.
- Nothing is available. - Nothing.

195
00:30:09,921 --> 00:30:12,583
- Any biscuits or such dry snacks?
- Nothing at all, sir.

196
00:30:14,526 --> 00:30:15,823
Okay, you may go.

197
00:30:25,403 --> 00:30:29,396
It's raining ever so heavily!
Don't think it'll stop.

198
00:30:30,775 --> 00:30:32,834
It'll stop automatically
once it pours heavily.

199
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:00,528
Hey! You still keep matches, eh?

200
00:31:05,677 --> 00:31:08,544
You kept them for me before.
Now whom do you keep them for?

201
00:31:10,448 --> 00:31:13,884
- For myself.
- You mean...

202
00:31:14,986 --> 00:31:18,114
...you've started smoking?
- No.

203
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:22,291
You haven't lost your habit of
forgetting, and I, of keeping!

204
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:29,628
Habits are strange

205
00:31:32,571 --> 00:31:35,165
To breathe is also a habit

206
00:31:36,908 --> 00:31:39,240
Continuing to live
is another one

207
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:43,741
We go on living...
and living...

208
00:31:45,417 --> 00:31:47,647
Habits sure are strange

209
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:56,259
One of Maya's poems?

210
00:32:03,301 --> 00:32:06,134
She really adored rains,
didn't she?

211
00:32:09,341 --> 00:32:11,400
Yes, she did.

212
00:32:14,346 --> 00:32:16,109
Doesn't she roam in the rain now?

213
00:32:18,883 --> 00:32:20,475
Which train are you taking?

214
00:32:22,454 --> 00:32:26,948
The morning one. The night train,
was cancelled, that's why.

215
00:32:28,326 --> 00:32:32,126
So I got the morning
train, at 7.30 a.m.

216
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:38,561
- Even my train's due then.
- I know.

217
00:32:40,472 --> 00:32:42,633
I heard you talking to the porter.

218
00:32:44,376 --> 00:32:46,139
It's for one night...

219
00:32:50,782 --> 00:32:52,306
What's for one night?

220
00:32:54,786 --> 00:32:57,983
You'll have to bear it
for one night. Isn't it?

221
00:33:01,092 --> 00:33:04,994
- I didn't say that.
- No you didn't, but...

222
00:33:07,832 --> 00:33:10,995
Anyway, you bore it for years,
so add one more night to them.

223
00:33:11,836 --> 00:33:15,328
- Who bore it all those years?
- You did, naturally.

224
00:33:17,575 --> 00:33:19,566
I didn't endure anything.

225
00:33:25,483 --> 00:33:28,543
- I was dishonest with you.
- Look.

226
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,011
This is not home.
It's a Waiting Room!

227
00:33:33,091 --> 00:33:37,494
That's what our house was!
A Waiting Room.

228
00:33:39,097 --> 00:33:43,363
Why do you want to rake the past?
I didn't say anything.

229
00:33:44,035 --> 00:33:48,369
- Didn't ask for anything.
- That's just what I mean.

230
00:33:50,442 --> 00:33:52,307
Had you said something...

231
00:33:55,046 --> 00:33:57,037
It's pouring very heavily now.

232
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:00,316
There's chill in the air, isn't it?

233
00:34:12,297 --> 00:34:14,060
What are you drinking?

234
00:34:16,067 --> 00:34:18,763
Eh? Just a little bit.
Else I feel cold.

235
00:34:21,806 --> 00:34:26,402
- Is it Whisky?
- Yes. Do you drink?

236
00:34:27,946 --> 00:34:31,473
- Yes, I do.
- Then shall I pour out a glass?

237
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:34,744
- A glass? Full glass?
- No, no...

238
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:38,419
- I mean a peg.
- Well...

239
00:34:41,126 --> 00:34:46,086
- Okay, will do. - No!
No need. He doesn't drink.

240
00:34:47,866 --> 00:34:50,426
It's pouring cats and dogs!
Suppose I feel cold?

241
00:34:50,635 --> 00:34:53,695
- Nothing doing. Wear your jacket.
- Listen to her.

242
00:34:54,038 --> 00:34:57,269
As if anyone does that!
It's pretty cold.

243
00:34:58,109 --> 00:34:59,770
Well, Mr. Station Master?

244
00:35:02,113 --> 00:35:09,281
- Do you know each other? - Yes.
Don't you recall the key incident?

245
00:35:09,921 --> 00:35:15,120
- No, no. I mean long before?
- Long before? You mean...

246
00:35:16,194 --> 00:35:18,185
It's not a life long
relationship or anything.

247
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:24,659
It's just for one night.
Better if one spends it nicely.

248
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:28,862
- What do you say, sir?
- But of course. What else?

249
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:34,404
This life is also a Waiting Room.

250
00:35:35,547 --> 00:35:38,607
Bingo! That's it. I was
also saying the same to her.

251
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,141
Enough! Stop it please.

252
00:35:44,422 --> 00:35:49,587
Sir, can one get some food
in this Waiting Room of Life?

253
00:35:49,928 --> 00:35:54,331
You'll get nothing, sir.
Even the tea-staff is closed now.

254
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:58,567
Don't you eat anything?
Or do you just drink?

255
00:35:59,337 --> 00:36:04,673
I eat. I've 2 boiled eggs.
You can have one if you wish.

256
00:36:07,011 --> 00:36:10,003
No, thanks. You see
Madam is a veggie!

257
00:36:11,049 --> 00:36:13,347
She doesn't even glance at an egg.
Let alone touch it!

258
00:36:15,186 --> 00:36:18,519
- Can't we order something
from outside? - Very difficult.

259
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:22,685
There's water all over. You
won't even get transport.

260
00:36:23,194 --> 00:36:25,992
But shall I send you some pillows?

261
00:36:26,865 --> 00:36:31,359
- Eating pillows won't help sleep.
- Stop it! Let him go now.

262
00:36:34,272 --> 00:36:38,208
Sir is very jovial. Had you
been alone, you'd be scared.

263
00:36:44,382 --> 00:36:48,375
- What must that man think?
- What?

264
00:36:49,888 --> 00:36:51,879
- He'll think I've made you
an indecent proposal. What else?

265
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:58,224
But he's right. We are lifelong
partners from our recent past.

266
00:37:00,565 --> 00:37:03,966
- I'll try to get some food.
- Let it be. I'm not hungry.

267
00:37:04,235 --> 00:37:08,638
How come? You were here before me,
and you mustn't have eaten at all.

268
00:37:09,374 --> 00:37:13,708
- But I'm not hungry.
- There it is again!

269
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:20,244
I'll just go and see.

270
00:38:05,296 --> 00:38:07,287
- What do you want?
- Whose cycle is that?

271
00:38:08,032 --> 00:38:12,867
- What will you do with it?
- Thought I'd get some food.

272
00:38:13,304 --> 00:38:18,139
- You'll have to go right in, and
it's pouring too. - Just give it...

273
00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:22,143
...and I'll try. - Go on.
- Do you have a raincoat?

274
00:38:22,313 --> 00:38:27,649
- No, but I can get you an umbrella.
- Umbrella? Riding a cycle?

275
00:38:28,453 --> 00:38:30,444
- May I?
- Sure, take it.

276
00:38:49,774 --> 00:38:52,709
Scat! Bloody things always.

277
00:40:51,629 --> 00:40:56,794
- Who is it?
- It's me. Open the door.

278
00:41:00,571 --> 00:41:03,972
- Where had you been?
- To get you some hot food.

279
00:41:06,377 --> 00:41:10,711
What's wrong with you?
Honestly, you are half-mad!

280
00:41:11,382 --> 00:41:15,284
- Why half?
- Okay, totally mad. Now sit.

281
00:41:47,685 --> 00:41:49,915
Come on. Change your clothes.

282
00:41:57,195 --> 00:41:59,254
Yes, I'll take them out for you.
You wipe yourself.

283
00:42:17,615 --> 00:42:20,345
- See? I did catch a cold.
- So?

284
00:42:22,286 --> 00:42:25,551
It's lying over there.
May I drink some?

285
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:28,884
Come along now. If you
haven't caught it, you will!

286
00:42:39,604 --> 00:42:42,732
What's the matter?
What happened?

287
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,951
Get you some food, eh?

288
00:43:21,545 --> 00:43:25,743
If only I'd get a hot
cup of tea now!

289
00:43:30,955 --> 00:43:32,616
Here you are.

290
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,026
- How many cups of tea do you drink?
- As many as I get.

291
00:43:41,632 --> 00:43:45,625
- And if you don't get them?
- I keep on asking till I get.

292
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:48,861
Well, you can ask all you want.
No more tea for you.

293
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,508
- May I ask why? - There's no
milk, tea or sugar. - Lying?

294
00:43:54,145 --> 00:43:57,137
- Yes!
- You rascal!

295
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:04,379
Sit down for a while. Don't start
your wifely morning chores.

296
00:44:04,722 --> 00:44:09,523
Sit and listen to the world news.
Indiraji has routed the opposition.

297
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:13,387
- She won at Rai Bareilly and...
- I'm going in... - Okay, okay.

298
00:44:14,065 --> 00:44:18,001
This is interesting.
Reagan has proved one thing.

299
00:44:18,302 --> 00:44:21,669
- What? - That bad actors
can become Presidents too!

300
00:44:22,673 --> 00:44:28,202
- Not interested. - Listen, aren't
you interested in world events?

301
00:44:28,746 --> 00:44:32,512
- And are you interested in
home events? - Why not?

302
00:44:35,219 --> 00:44:38,154
- What's happening?
- Your breakfast is being made.

303
00:44:38,689 --> 00:44:41,351
When you have your bath,
it'll be laid on the table.

304
00:44:42,126 --> 00:44:46,028
You know your office timings, so
I won't remind you like other wives.

305
00:44:46,864 --> 00:44:51,096
Lf, you go, good. If you
don't... all the better!

306
00:44:53,704 --> 00:44:57,697
- You don't seem a new bride.
- What do you mean?

307
00:44:58,642 --> 00:45:00,837
What I mean is, that,
you look an expert wife!

308
00:45:12,161 --> 00:45:15,722
- The Holy thread? Is Grandpa...
- Yes. Mom had phoned.

309
00:45:15,998 --> 00:45:18,933
He's going to Badrinath, and,
wants to meet us before leaving.

310
00:45:29,111 --> 00:45:33,445
You're no less than Grandpa.
You recite the mantra very seriously!

311
00:45:35,451 --> 00:45:37,009
Answer the phone, will you?

312
00:45:42,024 --> 00:45:44,015
Yes, this is Sudha speaking...

313
00:45:50,132 --> 00:45:54,193
- Hold on; I'll just call him.
Your phone. - Who is it?

314
00:45:59,108 --> 00:46:03,101
- Tell her to phone me in office.
- Tell her yourself.

315
00:46:25,301 --> 00:46:27,292
Sudha, listen to me.

316
00:46:30,072 --> 00:46:32,063
Don't make me feel a cad.

317
00:46:33,275 --> 00:46:35,072
I haven't hidden anything from you.

318
00:46:37,746 --> 00:46:41,079
Maya can't bear this.
That's why she phones.

319
00:46:43,152 --> 00:46:47,418
I can; that's why I don't
phone or even meet her.

320
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,622
But the fact is, we both
are trying to...

321
00:46:56,098 --> 00:46:58,362
We both are trying to live
without each other.

322
00:47:01,103 --> 00:47:04,903
I have you. But she has nobody.

323
00:47:17,686 --> 00:47:18,914
What is it?

324
00:47:23,125 --> 00:47:24,592
I'll just come.

325
00:47:27,563 --> 00:47:32,500
- Maya shall I say you're out?
- Why? I'll take it in my cabin.

326
00:48:04,166 --> 00:48:06,964
- Hello, Maya.
- Mahen?

327
00:48:14,176 --> 00:48:17,577
Do you know, your wife's voice...

328
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:20,177
...is sweeter than yours.

329
00:48:22,184 --> 00:48:25,915
It sounds as though it's coming
out of a fragile throat.

330
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:35,194
I wanted to talk to her...
but I got scared.

331
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,191
She won't hit me, will she?

332
00:48:43,272 --> 00:48:45,399
She can't hit you, on
the phone at least.

333
00:48:46,675 --> 00:48:48,199
Mahen...

334
00:48:50,346 --> 00:48:54,339
My breath is coming in short
gasps like vermicelli pieces.

335
00:48:56,418 --> 00:49:00,616
Please lend me a long breath.

336
00:49:03,225 --> 00:49:05,216
From Pune to Mohenjo Daro.

337
00:49:06,996 --> 00:49:09,988
Then I won't pester you
for a long time.

338
00:49:15,838 --> 00:49:19,239
I bring sadness to
some people as it is.

339
00:49:21,176 --> 00:49:23,110
I don't want to cause sorrow
to any one else now.

340
00:49:24,713 --> 00:49:30,117
Especially to you. Never!

341
00:50:30,379 --> 00:50:34,440
Listen... What's this?

342
00:50:35,184 --> 00:50:37,243
This 3 yards long muffler.

343
00:50:39,588 --> 00:50:43,684
- Where did you find it?
- In a case. But what is it?

344
00:50:44,326 --> 00:50:47,056
It's a muffler alright,
but it's called something else.

345
00:50:48,764 --> 00:50:51,892
It's Maya's.
She had got it from Nepal.

346
00:50:55,237 --> 00:50:58,104
There are few other things too!
They look expensive.

347
00:50:58,507 --> 00:51:02,341
- Why not give them to her?
She can use them. - Meaning?

348
00:51:03,345 --> 00:51:05,939
There's a beautiful woollen coat.

349
00:51:06,281 --> 00:51:10,547
A pair of Jeans, some
cosmetics, a pair of goggles...

350
00:51:10,752 --> 00:51:12,344
...which neither of as can use.

351
00:51:20,529 --> 00:51:24,966
I don't mind keeping them,
but they're expensive things.

352
00:51:25,367 --> 00:51:27,358
They'll get spoilt
just lying around.

353
00:51:31,206 --> 00:51:34,107
Okay. I'll send them tomorrow
with our servant.

354
00:51:35,544 --> 00:51:37,375
No! It won't look nice.

355
00:51:39,548 --> 00:51:41,379
Why don't you give them yourself?

356
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:45,911
Else, phone her at least.

357
00:52:10,579 --> 00:52:13,013
Listen... this.
What are you looking for?

358
00:52:14,016 --> 00:52:20,012
- I had kept some papers here.
- Maya's letters you mean?

359
00:52:23,959 --> 00:52:26,018
I've kept them. I'll just get them.

360
00:52:37,606 --> 00:52:39,096
Here you are.

361
00:52:49,952 --> 00:52:54,616
- Your ornaments were in this.
- I removed mine and kept yours.

362
00:52:57,826 --> 00:53:02,126
- Here keep your jewellery in this.
- You're returning her letters?

363
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,660
- Shall I?
- You got offended.

364
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:11,862
I won't even return her things
to her, if you say so.

365
00:53:12,641 --> 00:53:16,133
- How can you send the letters?
- No... I just asked.

366
00:53:18,247 --> 00:53:22,650
These are her poems, not letters.
Sent to me from various places.

367
00:53:26,488 --> 00:53:29,924
You pack the things. I'll
ask Mona to take them.

368
00:53:53,515 --> 00:53:56,507
- Sing something.
- I'm setting the chord!

369
00:53:57,452 --> 00:54:00,512
- Who?
- I'm setting the chord!

370
00:54:04,526 --> 00:54:09,190
- It sounds fine to me. Please sing.
- You sing and I'll play.

371
00:54:09,531 --> 00:54:15,436
- Don't try my musical abilities.
You'll run away. - Then learn.

372
00:54:15,671 --> 00:54:18,868
I tried to, once.
But that was enough.

373
00:54:21,476 --> 00:54:24,741
- I used to learn the violin.
- Really? - As a school boy.

374
00:54:25,714 --> 00:54:30,310
Grandpa got me a violin, and
I played it, whenever I played...

375
00:54:30,752 --> 00:54:35,280
...others laughed. - Why?
- I left it. - Why did they laugh?

376
00:54:35,691 --> 00:54:39,559
I was a 'lefty' as a kid, so,
I held the violin the wrong way.

377
00:54:42,497 --> 00:54:47,093
- You wanted to be a violinist?
- I wanted to become things.

378
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:51,037
- But I became something else.
- Oh? What did you want to become?

379
00:54:53,909 --> 00:54:57,845
- You'll laugh.
- No. I won't laugh. Tell me.

380
00:54:59,815 --> 00:55:01,578
You won't laugh?

381
00:55:04,019 --> 00:55:06,419
I wanted to become an actor!

382
00:55:10,325 --> 00:55:14,056
Honestly. I was so fond of
seeing my own mug on the screen.

383
00:55:15,597 --> 00:55:19,124
Remember, when we were engaged
I got a chance to be a news-reader.

384
00:55:20,602 --> 00:55:26,370
Once, while reading the news, I felt,
some emotions must be put into it.

385
00:55:26,675 --> 00:55:29,473
Not much but still. So I said...

386
00:55:30,779 --> 00:55:33,612
Because of a boat mishap...

387
00:55:34,783 --> 00:55:37,217
...45 people are missing.

388
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:42,351
30 bodies have been found,
but 15 are still untraced.

389
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:09,647
- Take it.
- You take it. It's not for me.

390
00:56:15,657 --> 00:56:16,646
Yes?

391
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:22,526
How are you? Yes, she's here.

392
00:56:23,732 --> 00:56:25,199
Sitting right across me.

393
00:56:27,068 --> 00:56:30,469
Then you tell her yourself.
Yes, she's at home now.

394
00:56:32,207 --> 00:56:34,675
- You wish to talk to her, right?
- I don't want to! - It'll be wrong.

395
00:56:35,677 --> 00:56:38,669
- Now that I've told her.
Just say 'hello'. - No, I can't.

396
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:44,347
Look, she wants to talk to you.
Just say hello and hang up.

397
00:56:44,619 --> 00:56:46,086
For my sake.

398
00:56:52,828 --> 00:56:56,229
Who Mom? I thought...

399
00:56:57,232 --> 00:57:01,032
He's laughing uproariously.
What did you say?

400
00:57:03,305 --> 00:57:06,502
Yes, I'll come in a few days.
How are you keeping?

401
00:57:06,975 --> 00:57:11,435
I'm fine. Okay... Why you...

402
00:57:16,785 --> 00:57:21,119
- C'mon, the servant will see to it.
- I think he's sleeping.

403
00:57:21,456 --> 00:57:26,052
If he's sleeping, then why
wake him? We'll go in quietly.

404
00:57:42,077 --> 00:57:43,738
Take this.

405
00:57:49,417 --> 00:57:53,547
- Sir... - Yes?
- A telegram has come.

406
00:57:54,756 --> 00:57:59,489
- Telegram?
- Not about Grandpa I hope.

407
00:58:17,712 --> 00:58:20,374
- This seems to be a letter.
- Yes.

408
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:23,780
- Sent telegraphically.
- Who has sent it?

409
00:58:25,453 --> 00:58:26,784
Maya.

410
00:58:31,293 --> 00:58:36,959
- What does she say?
- That some more things are with us.

411
00:58:37,399 --> 00:58:41,631
- She has asked for them.
- What things? I don't know any.

412
00:58:42,304 --> 00:58:44,238
- Read it.
- You read it aloud.

413
00:59:03,491 --> 00:59:09,225
Do you remember how once, when
cyclists without light were fined

414
00:59:10,966 --> 00:59:14,163
How we had acted like paupers

415
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:18,967
And the constable had given us
an 8 anna coin and sent us

416
00:59:20,742 --> 00:59:24,178
4 annas were mine.
Send them to me

417
00:59:33,154 --> 00:59:35,850
I've left behind some wet days
from the rainy season...

418
00:59:37,459 --> 00:59:40,019
There's one night too,
wrapped in a letter I wrote...

419
00:59:41,863 --> 00:59:46,527
Shut off, that might. My other
things are also with you

420
00:59:48,036 --> 00:59:52,632
Send that back to me.
Some of it is like fallen leaves.

421
00:59:55,543 --> 00:59:58,478
The sound of the fallen leaves.

422
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:01,540
...had adorned my ears once,
and come back to me.

423
01:00:03,885 --> 01:00:06,877
That branch is still quivering.

424
01:00:08,223 --> 01:00:09,884
Send it back to me.

425
01:00:12,894 --> 01:00:14,885
116 moonlit nights.

426
01:00:18,099 --> 01:00:20,090
And that mole on your shoulder.

427
01:00:24,906 --> 01:00:29,240
The scent of the wet henna...
and false promises.

428
01:00:30,578 --> 01:00:32,239
Why did I send her things back?

429
01:00:33,915 --> 01:00:36,406
She's living with us night
and day, as it is.

430
01:00:38,119 --> 01:00:41,111
If those things had remained here,
what would've happened?

431
01:06:55,296 --> 01:06:59,960
- You must be having the matches.
- Yes. Matches and cigarettes too.

432
01:07:01,969 --> 01:07:03,960
May I ask you something?

433
01:07:06,874 --> 01:07:10,310
Why did you think of
this trip suddenly?

434
01:07:11,746 --> 01:07:14,874
Why? We're going on our honeymoon.
Is that a bad thing?

435
01:07:17,085 --> 01:07:19,747
You're not running away
from anyone, are you?

436
01:07:22,323 --> 01:07:25,656
- Who?
- You know who.

437
01:07:28,729 --> 01:07:31,789
This thought of Maya, constantly
between us, is not good.

438
01:07:37,505 --> 01:07:39,666
Remember you saying this
to me in Panchgani?

439
01:07:40,341 --> 01:07:43,174
That do what is honest and right.

440
01:07:45,813 --> 01:07:47,804
And believe me,
I'm doing just that.

441
01:07:50,251 --> 01:07:53,152
I loved Maya. That's true.

442
01:07:54,222 --> 01:07:56,349
That I'm trying to forget her
is a right thing to do.

443
01:07:58,359 --> 01:08:01,351
But if you don't help me, to,
it'll be very difficult for me.

444
01:08:02,430 --> 01:08:04,557
Because, more than me,
you remember her!

445
01:08:13,841 --> 01:08:16,366
- If the has been isn't...
- Has been?

446
01:08:18,913 --> 01:08:20,972
The past. What's gone by...

447
01:08:22,283 --> 01:08:24,547
What is past, let it
remain a past. Don't stop it.

448
01:08:28,956 --> 01:08:32,949
But you added... You drink
it sometimes. So I drank.

449
01:08:34,729 --> 01:08:38,130
At first that tea-stall man
said what you had said.

450
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:42,394
- What? - That the milk and
tea leaves are finished.

451
01:08:45,173 --> 01:08:47,266
- Then you too must've said
what you had said. - What?

452
01:08:48,943 --> 01:08:52,003
- You rascal!
- No.

453
01:08:52,213 --> 01:08:55,944
Had I said that he'd have never
made the tea. He was dozing.

454
01:08:56,417 --> 01:08:58,009
I woke him, so...

455
01:09:03,858 --> 01:09:06,850
- That's all we needed!!
- I think all the lights have fused.

456
01:09:08,796 --> 01:09:14,063
- Where are the matches?
Sit tight. - Where are you going?

457
01:09:15,436 --> 01:09:18,303
- I'll see if I can get a lantern.
- Wait!

458
01:09:19,774 --> 01:09:21,765
- I won't stay here alone.
- Finish your tea first.

459
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:24,944
- I've finished it.
- Right. Come along then.

460
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:46,463
Can't you see or something?
I told you to sit inside!

461
01:09:48,236 --> 01:09:50,227
Can't wait for 2 minutes, can you?

462
01:09:51,939 --> 01:09:53,463
Are you badly hurt?

463
01:09:58,879 --> 01:10:00,471
You are hurt.

464
01:10:11,492 --> 01:10:14,950
So many years have passed.
But I haven't lost the habit.

465
01:10:16,897 --> 01:10:21,095
One loses habits,
but not the right!

466
01:10:27,008 --> 01:10:30,000
- Keep sitting here. I'll just come.
- Where are you going?

467
01:10:30,511 --> 01:10:34,845
- You'll get wet again.
- No. He had candles. Don't move.

468
01:10:44,425 --> 01:10:48,361
He didn't give me the candle.
Anyway, we got this.

469
01:10:48,529 --> 01:10:52,522
There are 2 lounge-chairs there,
it's better that we sleep now.

470
01:10:55,303 --> 01:10:57,533
What's the matter? Are you hurt?

471
01:10:59,273 --> 01:11:01,070
Is it very bad?

472
01:11:03,377 --> 01:11:07,541
On the knee, eh?
May I have a look? - No!

473
01:11:08,883 --> 01:11:10,544
Let me see at least.

474
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:17,681
It's bleeding.

475
01:11:21,562 --> 01:11:23,553
Hold on. Keep it like this.

476
01:11:33,674 --> 01:11:37,576
- What's that you're doing?
- I'm not drinking it.

477
01:11:37,978 --> 01:11:39,570
I'm using it as a medicine.

478
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:44,911
No, it'll burn.

479
01:17:31,331 --> 01:17:34,789
Attention please. The
safety signs are off.

480
01:17:35,269 --> 01:17:39,262
You can remove your seat-belts
and smoke if you wish.

481
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:44,104
But it's better to keep the belts,
during the flight. Thank you.

482
01:17:46,547 --> 01:17:48,538
Our honeymoon just flew...

483
01:17:50,884 --> 01:17:53,944
I was tired. I can't
take it for too long.

484
01:17:55,122 --> 01:17:58,285
You mean the journey, or...

485
01:17:59,626 --> 01:18:03,960
- The journey!
- Okay, I'll sleep now.

486
01:18:05,032 --> 01:18:06,966
Wake me up if there's bumping.

487
01:18:11,972 --> 01:18:16,773
We were told to congratulate you
when in air. After the take-off.

488
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:20,970
Birthday wishes?
What's the date today?

489
01:18:22,449 --> 01:18:25,782
Your name is my lifeline.
And I die for you.

490
01:18:30,991 --> 01:18:36,588
Only she can do this! She'll
never do anything normally.

491
01:18:37,498 --> 01:18:40,661
See. How she caught me in air!

492
01:18:41,668 --> 01:18:44,831
- Why didn't you tell me it was
your birthday? - I didn't know.

493
01:18:45,139 --> 01:18:49,599
- I didn't remember at all.
Honestly, dear. - Go to sleep.

494
01:18:52,379 --> 01:18:54,176
Don't get off midway!

495
01:18:58,452 --> 01:19:02,013
I pity this silly girl, and
also can't help loving her.

496
01:19:04,758 --> 01:19:09,491
How shall I explain what she is.
Sometimes I get scared for her.

497
01:19:12,833 --> 01:19:15,301
Why didn't you marry her.

498
01:19:18,772 --> 01:19:21,434
I had told you, when I had
come to see you again.

499
01:19:23,443 --> 01:19:27,436
She's so impulsive,
I tell you! Once...

500
01:19:44,798 --> 01:19:47,858
- What's going on?
- Ride it! A classic piece.

501
01:19:48,202 --> 01:19:51,729
And this idiot wants to sell it.
Please, let's buy it.

502
01:19:52,873 --> 01:19:56,070
Are you crazy? Who'll
ride it? You or me?

503
01:19:56,476 --> 01:20:00,003
- One filling gas will ride it.
- You know how to ride, eh?

504
01:20:00,347 --> 01:20:04,078
I just rode it here. And
I've improved a lot too.

505
01:20:06,653 --> 01:20:10,851
Wait. Are you mad, girl?
Know how dangerous this is?

506
01:20:11,758 --> 01:20:14,750
My friend had an accident once.
He was broken in 50 places!

507
01:20:15,262 --> 01:20:20,097
- He didn't die. - Wished he had.
- You always dread death!

508
01:20:20,934 --> 01:20:24,097
Look at him. He's riding for years.
Has he died? Well, Guddu?

509
01:20:27,107 --> 01:20:29,234
- Please let us buy it.
- Are you mad?

510
01:20:31,245 --> 01:20:34,442
Okay. You buy it!
I'll ride it now and then.

511
01:20:37,184 --> 01:20:38,515
Okay...

512
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:43,248
Ask him to come at
Mona's place tomorrow.

513
01:20:44,057 --> 01:20:47,652
You know where I live with Mona.
Come there tomorrow.

514
01:20:50,130 --> 01:20:53,395
You're going with her?
Best of luck! Easy now.

515
01:20:53,767 --> 01:20:58,830
- Hurry up...
- Hey, take care you...

516
01:21:12,319 --> 01:21:16,813
- Whose baby is that?
- Maya's. - What?

517
01:21:17,157 --> 01:21:20,923
- She has a legitimate child.
- What nonsense!

518
01:21:21,194 --> 01:21:24,721
Look, anything's possible
with this girl. Go in and see.

519
01:21:28,168 --> 01:21:29,567
Go on!

520
01:21:42,749 --> 01:21:47,186
- What's all this?
- He's sleeping. - But what's this?

521
01:21:47,354 --> 01:21:52,018
- It's a baby I bought.
- Bought?

522
01:21:52,192 --> 01:21:56,754
Yes. Look he has no mother.
And that idiot...

523
01:21:57,097 --> 01:21:59,531
...he can't even feed him milk.
How will he bring him up?

524
01:22:00,934 --> 01:22:02,799
That's why you brought him here.

525
01:22:06,139 --> 01:22:10,075
- So where did you find him?
- My bike stalled near that slum.

526
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:12,301
You've lost your sense!

527
01:22:14,614 --> 01:22:19,347
Come, let's return the baby.
This could become a police case.

528
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:24,220
Why? I've paid for him.
It's illegal only if...

529
01:22:24,391 --> 01:22:28,225
...it's taken without paying.
- Let's return it. Or I'll hit you!

530
01:22:29,229 --> 01:22:32,562
- Take him.
- Hold on, the baby...

531
01:22:32,766 --> 01:22:35,098
Give him to me. I'll take him.

532
01:22:36,069 --> 01:22:40,403
Come with me. Where will
I search his father?

533
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:46,110
- I want the baby.
- Get going, else I'll hit you.

534
01:22:51,451 --> 01:22:53,248
Here's a pillow and a bed-sheet.

535
01:22:56,189 --> 01:22:59,852
- Now sleep like a good girl.
- I want a baby.

536
01:23:01,928 --> 01:23:05,261
Where shall I get one from?
An orphanage?

537
01:23:07,667 --> 01:23:09,999
Why? Can't I have my own baby?

538
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:17,603
Yes, of course. Want one?

539
01:23:19,012 --> 01:23:21,674
- Yes.
- Then come. Let's get married.

540
01:23:22,282 --> 01:23:25,683
For 1 baby. I must take on
10 other problems!

541
01:23:27,087 --> 01:23:30,955
I see. So marriage is a problem!

542
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:37,794
How do you know what it is?
I know. I've seen it.

543
01:23:41,134 --> 01:23:45,696
I've seen a lot of relationships.
Some end... get broken.

544
01:23:47,307 --> 01:23:49,775
- But when a marriage ends...
- Stop it!

545
01:23:50,310 --> 01:23:53,143
...it begins to rot.
Gets dirty.

546
01:23:54,481 --> 01:23:56,711
And I don't want that
to happen to us!

547
01:23:57,017 --> 01:24:00,453
So, you don't wish to marry.

548
01:24:02,889 --> 01:24:05,881
Any guarantee about me?
I may live, or I may not.

549
01:24:06,326 --> 01:24:09,159
- Meaning?
- Go and sleep.

550
01:24:13,834 --> 01:24:18,100
Look, I had told you.
I'm engaged to be married.

551
01:24:20,107 --> 01:24:24,942
The day Grandpa calls me,
he'll send me back, married.

552
01:24:26,346 --> 01:24:30,180
So get married. But give
the child to me.

553
01:24:30,417 --> 01:24:34,080
- Yes. We'll give it to her.
- Sure?

554
01:24:35,288 --> 01:24:38,815
- Promise?
- No...

555
01:24:39,159 --> 01:24:43,357
We'll soon land at the Pune airport.

556
01:24:43,530 --> 01:24:47,261
Please stop smoking and tie
your seat-belts. Thank you.

557
01:24:48,368 --> 01:24:50,529
- That's mine.
- So keep it that side.

558
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:03,112
Never uses them. Don't know
where she got them from!

559
01:25:03,283 --> 01:25:07,617
- Took quite a lot. Found them under
her pillow. - Is she conscious?

560
01:25:07,787 --> 01:25:12,383
Yes, but asks to be discharged
before you got here. I'll just come.

561
01:25:12,726 --> 01:25:15,388
Take this money. No, Mona, take it.

562
01:25:51,865 --> 01:25:55,858
Don't hit me. It hurts a lot.

563
01:26:12,285 --> 01:26:14,276
You're congratulating me
for what you've done?

564
01:26:15,589 --> 01:26:17,454
I mistimed it, didn't I?

565
01:26:19,459 --> 01:26:22,451
When one dies the soul
goes to heaven.

566
01:26:24,531 --> 01:26:28,865
Then I thought I'd pass your plane...

567
01:26:30,470 --> 01:26:32,461
...and say goodbye to you.

568
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:35,869
But everything went wrong.

569
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:45,613
Even if one takes an overdose,
one doesn't die.

570
01:26:48,221 --> 01:26:49,813
It only makes one vomit!

571
01:26:52,492 --> 01:26:56,758
If one wishes to commit suicide,
one should take only enough...

572
01:26:57,631 --> 01:26:59,496
...to digest!

573
01:27:02,502 --> 01:27:04,493
You've done nothing, praise worthy!

574
01:27:06,406 --> 01:27:08,499
- For which you should get
a Nobel Prize! - Don't scold me.

575
01:27:16,449 --> 01:27:20,783
If you let me wipe your eyes
I'll let you scold me.

576
01:27:33,867 --> 01:27:37,064
Who has embroidered this 'M'?
Your wife?

577
01:27:42,609 --> 01:27:44,201
When will you introduce us?

578
01:27:46,946 --> 01:27:48,937
Not in the condition you're
in now, at least.

579
01:27:53,753 --> 01:27:55,550
Have you told her about this?

580
01:27:59,092 --> 01:28:00,889
I've not told her anything as yet.

581
01:28:24,851 --> 01:28:29,311
- What are you doing?
- Sniffing. To see if you're drunk.

582
01:28:30,190 --> 01:28:33,455
- You slept on an empty stomach.
- Not hungry.

583
01:28:34,661 --> 01:28:38,427
- Just sleepy.
- Then go to sleep.

584
01:29:39,159 --> 01:29:44,995
Shall I go to Wai? I've
to go to my school too.

585
01:29:46,166 --> 01:29:50,068
- Why? Want to teach again?
- No.

586
01:29:51,070 --> 01:29:52,867
I had to meet the principal, and...

587
01:29:55,675 --> 01:29:57,666
Where do you always
get matches from?

588
01:29:58,812 --> 01:30:02,339
Thought I'd stay with Mom
for a few days. - No...

589
01:30:03,383 --> 01:30:06,944
You'll return today itself.
I'll come to collect you.

590
01:30:08,087 --> 01:30:11,079
No, I'll come to my own.

591
01:30:11,958 --> 01:30:17,089
Don't phone and make excuses.
I'll come at midnight if I have to.

592
01:30:20,567 --> 01:30:23,900
- Did you go to your class?
- Not yet. I'll go afterwards.

593
01:30:28,141 --> 01:30:32,669
- I miss the kids so much.
- You'll soon have your own.

594
01:30:32,913 --> 01:30:37,077
- Then you won't miss them.
- No, I'll always miss them.

595
01:30:42,088 --> 01:30:44,750
How's your new student?

596
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:50,218
- One hitch though. - What?
- Here the class is for45 minutes.

597
01:30:50,497 --> 01:30:55,491
There it's a 24 hour job.
Whether the student is present or not.

598
01:30:56,102 --> 01:30:58,093
Less of teaching,
and more of learning.

599
01:31:01,107 --> 01:31:05,510
Don't get bloated thinking that
I tried suicide for you.

600
01:31:08,381 --> 01:31:13,114
Actually I didn't even know...
that I loved you so much.

601
01:31:16,723 --> 01:31:20,124
I think marriage is also
something like this.

602
01:31:22,128 --> 01:31:27,122
Overdose of love. Couldn't kill
oneself, so got married. Right?

603
01:31:28,134 --> 01:31:31,968
- Next time try that. Marriage!
- With you!

604
01:31:33,139 --> 01:31:36,973
Can't you have a 2nd wife?

605
01:31:38,144 --> 01:31:41,272
- Marry me please.
- Stop talking nonsense.

606
01:31:42,148 --> 01:31:47,142
- Will your wife mind?
- Will you shut your mouth?

607
01:31:48,655 --> 01:31:51,749
Shut it with your own mouth.

608
01:36:45,184 --> 01:36:48,449
3 pants...

609
01:36:50,990 --> 01:36:53,458
And 2 shirts.

610
01:36:56,195 --> 01:36:58,186
What's this, Madam?

611
01:37:08,474 --> 01:37:12,877
- It all comes to 20 plus 4.
- That's 24. Okay.

612
01:37:38,838 --> 01:37:41,671
- Don't you have something
to tell me? - What?

613
01:37:47,513 --> 01:37:50,505
...were you meeting
Maya all these days?

614
01:38:09,535 --> 01:38:12,936
- I thought you never hid
anything from me. - You see...

615
01:38:17,610 --> 01:38:20,272
I think we should call Maya here.

616
01:38:21,447 --> 01:38:25,281
- We did a bad thing to avoid her.
- Don't pull me into it.

617
01:38:26,052 --> 01:38:29,317
I neither want to meet anybody
nor have I avoided anyone.

618
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:42,561
You?

619
01:38:43,970 --> 01:38:47,030
You called me after centuries!

620
01:38:47,573 --> 01:38:52,408
Last time you called me was
during Lord Buddha's time.

621
01:38:52,745 --> 01:38:56,579
- And after that you...
- Listen, Maya, Listen!

622
01:38:58,484 --> 01:39:00,577
Can you come here tonight?

623
01:39:02,155 --> 01:39:03,747
Don't scream! Speak softly.

624
01:39:07,593 --> 01:39:11,723
- Sudha was invited you.
- Why lie? Why should I call her?

625
01:39:11,931 --> 01:39:16,595
Keep quiet! What if she comes?
She won't carry away your house.

626
01:39:34,620 --> 01:39:36,611
I told you not to pull me into this.

627
01:39:38,491 --> 01:39:42,689
Everyday I see poems on your hankies
lipstick marks on your sleeves...

628
01:39:42,862 --> 01:39:47,299
...on your coat. I find earrings.
If you want to meet her, do so.

629
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:51,192
But don't bring her here.
I won't have her in my house.

630
01:39:51,704 --> 01:39:54,639
This house is not just yours.
It's my home too!

631
01:39:55,641 --> 01:39:57,632
I'm bringing her at night.

632
01:40:14,894 --> 01:40:17,488
- What do we do?
- What can we do?

633
01:40:18,664 --> 01:40:21,326
If she tells us and goes, we
can at least search for her.

634
01:41:50,289 --> 01:41:53,087
I'm coming between you both.
So I'm leaving

635
01:42:12,545 --> 01:42:15,776
I'm coming between you both.
So I'm going away

636
01:43:01,327 --> 01:43:05,661
You weren't here. She's here
For the past 2 months now.

637
01:43:06,699 --> 01:43:10,965
I don't know what went wrong.
She doesn't tell me anything.

638
01:43:12,104 --> 01:43:15,835
I've not talked to my son-in-law,
nor did she allow me to.

639
01:43:17,610 --> 01:43:21,842
- Where is she now?
- In the school at Panchgani.

640
01:43:23,015 --> 01:43:26,507
At first she came every
Saturday. But not anymore.

641
01:43:27,753 --> 01:43:31,587
She knows that I'm alone.
Even then...

642
01:43:32,958 --> 01:43:38,453
Stop it. I'm going, aren't I?
I'll talk to her.

643
01:43:39,365 --> 01:43:43,301
I don't think that'll help.
If it was to make a difference...

644
01:43:43,536 --> 01:43:46,096
...her husband would've come here.

645
01:43:48,874 --> 01:43:52,469
I'll meet Sudha,
and see what happens.

646
01:43:57,950 --> 01:44:00,612
No, Grandpa, don't go to him.

647
01:44:02,088 --> 01:44:05,216
I told you how much
they love each other.

648
01:44:08,461 --> 01:44:14,457
I stopped mom with a great effort
told her to wait till you came.

649
01:44:15,735 --> 01:44:18,898
Because you can understand. Not Mom.

650
01:44:24,310 --> 01:44:28,906
And to be honest, he has not
ill treated me even for a moment.

651
01:44:30,850 --> 01:44:34,752
Grandpa, he has endured so much
just out of respect for you.

652
01:44:35,855 --> 01:44:40,053
You also give him respect and
don't say a word, or meet him.

653
01:44:43,929 --> 01:44:45,920
And what will you do?

654
01:44:48,601 --> 01:44:51,263
I'm working here. In this school.

655
01:44:53,072 --> 01:44:55,939
And what of the work
you've left behind?

656
01:44:58,110 --> 01:45:03,844
I just left the place. Call
it an excuse or a reason.

657
01:45:05,484 --> 01:45:08,214
Else, no body will be happy.

658
01:45:09,321 --> 01:45:12,688
Neither I, nor him.

659
01:45:13,959 --> 01:45:17,952
Okay, child. It's alright.

660
01:45:18,964 --> 01:45:23,628
Accept whatever fate offers you.
Let some time go by...

661
01:45:25,104 --> 01:45:29,507
In between, if he comes
to collect you...

662
01:45:30,543 --> 01:45:34,138
...then go with him. Don't
be adamant, silly girl.

663
01:45:35,981 --> 01:45:38,973
But if he doesn't come, then...

664
01:45:41,487 --> 01:45:43,978
...fine. Que sera, sera!

665
01:45:57,336 --> 01:46:01,329
You'll become a Vice-Principal
But it's very far from here.

666
01:46:02,007 --> 01:46:05,670
- Please write my name too
- You'll have to go at once.

667
01:46:07,012 --> 01:46:10,812
- That'll be even better.
- But what about Mahender?

668
01:46:13,018 --> 01:46:17,352
What about him? It's 2
months already, Ma'am.

669
01:46:18,591 --> 01:46:23,585
- And in between all this...
- Mahender didn't come? - No.

670
01:46:25,631 --> 01:46:27,622
You also didn't try?

671
01:46:29,034 --> 01:46:32,868
I had phoned him a few days ago,
and Maya answered it.

672
01:46:35,207 --> 01:46:37,641
I kept the phone down,
without talking.

673
01:46:41,614 --> 01:46:45,675
- Thinking of taking a divorce?
- No.

674
01:46:47,052 --> 01:46:49,043
Thinking of giving it.

675
01:46:51,190 --> 01:46:54,648
I had deliberately made
an error. I married you.

676
01:46:55,594 --> 01:47:00,793
Today I'm rectifying it.
Actually your honesty won me.

677
01:47:01,834 --> 01:47:04,667
Firstly, when you had come
to break off from me.

678
01:47:05,204 --> 01:47:07,934
And secondly, when you came
and proposed to me.

679
01:47:09,842 --> 01:47:13,243
Maya is very different from us.
But what can I do?

680
01:47:14,013 --> 01:47:18,746
I'm an ordinary woman.
Stubborn and jealous too.

681
01:47:19,552 --> 01:47:24,546
And melt too. I'm doing you
a favour as I go.

682
01:47:25,624 --> 01:47:29,082
I've convinced Grandpa.
He won't say a word to you.

683
01:47:30,029 --> 01:47:33,226
You better marry Maya.
Don't worry about me.

684
01:47:34,166 --> 01:47:38,102
I'm walking out of your life on
my own. The place I'm going...

685
01:47:38,837 --> 01:47:44,503
I don't want to give you the address.
Please don't search for me. Sudha.

686
01:49:28,213 --> 01:49:31,876
You're sitting here? When
did you come out here?

687
01:49:33,619 --> 01:49:35,211
Quite some time back.

688
01:49:53,372 --> 01:49:57,365
- Should've tried to sleep.
- I couldn't sleep.

689
01:50:01,980 --> 01:50:06,110
Didn't even know when you put
a blanket, kept a glass of water...

690
01:50:09,388 --> 01:50:11,583
Do you carry the whole house
with you or something?

691
01:50:14,259 --> 01:50:16,523
You've also scattered all
your things around...

692
01:50:17,696 --> 01:50:21,632
...as though you're at home.
The towel is lying somewhere.

693
01:50:22,634 --> 01:50:28,072
The soap, elsewhere. Even your wet
clothes are still in the bathroom.

694
01:50:39,551 --> 01:50:43,954
Was it because I was around,
or is it still a habit with you?

695
01:50:49,294 --> 01:50:51,285
It feels very homely.

696
01:50:55,534 --> 01:50:57,934
- Sudha.
- Yes?

697
01:51:01,106 --> 01:51:02,903
Don't you have anything to ask me?

698
01:51:06,311 --> 01:51:08,302
Should I?

699
01:51:15,254 --> 01:51:17,313
One can't change the past events.

700
01:51:20,192 --> 01:51:24,185
Man can only regret and apologize.

701
01:51:29,201 --> 01:51:31,328
- I behaved very badly...
- How's Maya?

702
01:51:41,580 --> 01:51:45,914
Do you remember, when we had
come back from Kudramukh...

703
01:51:47,786 --> 01:51:52,621
- It was your birthday.
- I got a telephone call.

704
01:51:54,159 --> 01:51:56,218
And you had to go out
on some urgent work.

705
01:51:58,931 --> 01:52:01,866
So you remember. That's it.

706
01:52:04,369 --> 01:52:06,360
I had gone to the hospital.

707
01:52:07,539 --> 01:52:09,632
That night Maya tried
to commit suicide.

708
01:52:13,946 --> 01:52:18,610
I didn't think it wise to
tell you, and I left quickly.

709
01:52:21,386 --> 01:52:27,120
After that I went to
see her for many days.

710
01:52:29,828 --> 01:52:31,819
I thought it was my duty
to save her.

711
01:52:35,567 --> 01:52:37,558
Mad, she was, no doubt!

712
01:52:40,472 --> 01:52:44,670
At times she'd cry.
At times she'd hug me.

713
01:52:46,912 --> 01:52:48,903
At times even fight with me.

714
01:52:50,849 --> 01:52:55,650
In this manner, one day, her
earring got caught in my coat.

715
01:52:56,788 --> 01:53:01,418
Like I found this earring
of yours caught in my shawl.

716
01:53:11,169 --> 01:53:13,831
May be I should have explained
everything to you.

717
01:53:16,842 --> 01:53:19,777
But I myself couldn't
understand anything at all.

718
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:23,871
Maya's behaviour scared me.

719
01:53:25,517 --> 01:53:28,918
I was trying to get round
to it, when she ran away!

720
01:53:31,723 --> 01:53:33,190
When I came back home,
you had gone away too.

721
01:53:36,461 --> 01:53:40,921
That's when I got a heart
attack, for the first time.

722
01:53:48,740 --> 01:53:50,469
Your going away hit me very badly.

723
01:53:53,578 --> 01:53:57,344
I was angry, and frustrated too.

724
01:54:02,888 --> 01:54:08,485
I was hospitalized for a month.
When I went home, Maya was there.

725
01:54:10,395 --> 01:54:12,727
Hearing about my sickness,
she came back home.

726
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:17,900
She stayed there for some
time to look after me.

727
01:54:33,452 --> 01:54:35,920
- It's very hot.
- Okay...

728
01:54:36,655 --> 01:54:40,523
Bear it a little.
You make others burn...

729
01:54:41,026 --> 01:54:45,360
- Let's see you go up in smoke too!
- Enough! - I've to do your feet.

730
01:54:56,341 --> 01:54:59,208
- Your feet are terrible!
- 100 times better than your mouth!

731
01:54:59,611 --> 01:55:05,049
- Seen your face in a mirror?
- Have you? - I see nothing else!

732
01:55:05,884 --> 01:55:08,876
- What are you doing?
- Made your feet beautiful.

733
01:55:10,222 --> 01:55:13,282
I've put my stamp on them.
You won't get lost now.

734
01:55:13,558 --> 01:55:18,018
- If you do show them your feet.
- What shall I do with you?

735
01:55:19,998 --> 01:55:23,729
- Make a pickle!
- I'm totally trapped by you.

736
01:55:25,003 --> 01:55:29,565
Mutual feeling, believe me!
Can't live with you, nor without you!

737
01:55:43,388 --> 01:55:47,381
- What happened? - I sounded
so good, I got disconnected.

738
01:55:50,896 --> 01:55:52,591
You've ruined it!
I had washed it.

739
01:55:54,132 --> 01:55:55,599
It's stinking!

740
01:56:03,475 --> 01:56:09,072
Hey come, sit. Mona...

741
01:56:09,414 --> 01:56:13,612
You look very happy...
Radiant! Are you pregnant?

742
01:56:14,619 --> 01:56:18,419
That's on the agenda! Next
week we're getting married.

743
01:56:24,629 --> 01:56:28,429
We haven't printed any cards.
Just invited a few, to the church.

744
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:34,204
- Party? You'll host it of course!
- What a stingy wife you've chosen.

745
01:56:34,506 --> 01:56:37,304
Can't help it. Else how will
I pull on a purser's salary?

746
01:56:43,915 --> 01:56:46,247
- Where's Maya?
- She's having a bath.

747
01:56:49,654 --> 01:56:51,645
I'm leaving my house
after I get married.

748
01:56:53,492 --> 01:56:56,984
I spoke to my landlady about Maya,
but she just wouldn't agree.

749
01:56:58,196 --> 01:57:01,495
It's alright for now, that
she's staying with you.

750
01:57:02,100 --> 01:57:04,091
But what will happen when
Sudha comes back?

751
01:57:08,673 --> 01:57:12,074
Honestly.
I'm very worried about her.

752
01:57:12,911 --> 01:57:14,674
She'll be all alone.

753
01:57:19,217 --> 01:57:20,878
Come Mona. We're getting late.

754
01:57:38,403 --> 01:57:40,200
Mona's got married too.

755
01:57:42,707 --> 01:57:44,698
She's going away now.

756
01:57:48,180 --> 01:57:50,171
Where will you stay now?

757
01:57:55,720 --> 01:57:58,120
If Sudha comes back,
what will you do?

758
01:57:59,724 --> 01:58:01,715
She'll throw me out, won't she?

759
01:58:03,128 --> 01:58:08,725
Of course, what else? Is it
proper to stay with me?

760
01:58:11,736 --> 01:58:13,727
You're sick now.

761
01:58:16,908 --> 01:58:18,739
And, when I become well?

762
01:58:34,759 --> 01:58:36,590
What are you doing?

763
01:58:38,296 --> 01:58:41,754
- Going for a ride-where?
- Anywhere.

764
01:58:42,434 --> 01:58:48,339
- On the roads; near the river.
- Okay, you sit behind and I'll ride.

765
01:59:13,231 --> 01:59:16,632
Why not go and get your wife?
I'll go away.

766
01:59:17,802 --> 01:59:20,293
Honestly. Don't worry about me.

767
01:59:21,206 --> 01:59:24,266
Are you mad? I didn't
ask you to leave.

768
01:59:25,210 --> 01:59:28,338
Not for that. Go and get your wife.

769
01:59:29,214 --> 01:59:31,148
And what shall I do about you?

770
01:59:33,285 --> 01:59:36,550
Get me... Get me married.

771
01:59:37,555 --> 01:59:41,719
- To whom?
- Anyone you like.

772
01:59:41,993 --> 01:59:46,726
I'll have to find somebody crazy
like you! Like that chap...

773
01:59:49,367 --> 01:59:52,495
He's a nice boy. So innocent!

774
01:59:54,239 --> 01:59:57,402
Innocent, eh? Then shall
I get you married to him?

775
01:59:58,643 --> 02:00:00,838
Okay. He has a motor-bike too!

776
02:00:05,317 --> 02:00:08,514
- You'll marry him for that?
- So what?

777
02:00:15,493 --> 02:00:17,358
As a groom, he'll come on a motor-bike.

778
02:00:20,865 --> 02:00:22,856
Your parents never seem to call you.

779
02:00:24,869 --> 02:00:26,860
Don't you feel like meeting them?

780
02:00:31,242 --> 02:00:35,372
I had been to them.
And I regretted it.

781
02:00:38,616 --> 02:00:40,607
I don't know what has
happened between them.

782
02:00:42,287 --> 02:00:47,748
Don't know why they're pulling on.

783
02:00:51,830 --> 02:00:56,164
Papa... He doesn't come home
on many nights.

784
02:00:58,470 --> 02:01:03,032
Mom... she never seems
to have any time.

785
02:01:06,911 --> 02:01:09,106
She can't accept her age.

786
02:01:13,685 --> 02:01:15,676
She was involved
with somebody else.

787
02:01:19,924 --> 02:01:25,089
When they live under one roof,
they're sarcastic to each other.

788
02:01:27,465 --> 02:01:30,593
- There's a lot of age difference
between them. - Yes.

789
02:01:33,538 --> 02:01:38,066
So what if she's a step-mother?
She brought me up, didn't she?

790
02:01:39,944 --> 02:01:43,675
But how? By keeping you
in various hostels.

791
02:01:57,962 --> 02:01:59,623
Hot tea, sir...

792
02:02:02,066 --> 02:02:07,971
- What's that? - It came yesterday
but the servant forgot about it.

793
02:02:12,343 --> 02:02:14,402
Where are you going so early?

794
02:02:17,115 --> 02:02:18,844
On some urgent work?

795
02:02:24,722 --> 02:02:28,818
Look very serious. Not in a
mood to fight, are you?

796
02:02:36,134 --> 02:02:37,999
I'm going to Sudha.

797
02:02:52,083 --> 02:02:55,177
Do you know what I'm
going to do with you.

798
02:02:57,889 --> 02:03:02,690
I'm going to put you in
her care. She's very wise.

799
02:03:04,929 --> 02:03:08,763
Only she can do, what is
what is correct and the truth.

800
02:03:12,036 --> 02:03:15,767
She must be knowing what
we both should do.

801
02:03:23,715 --> 02:03:27,879
I had deliberately
erred and married you.

802
02:03:31,923 --> 02:03:34,915
Today I'm rectifying that error

803
02:03:42,834 --> 02:03:44,324
What's the matter?

804
02:03:50,975 --> 02:03:52,408
What's wrong?

805
02:04:25,009 --> 02:04:28,570
- I'm going to get your wife.
- You'll not go anywhere!

806
02:04:32,116 --> 02:04:34,448
If you leave this house,
I'll kill you!

807
02:10:02,113 --> 02:10:06,607
All night, only I talked.
You didn't tell me anything.

808
02:10:26,337 --> 02:10:28,202
What did I have to tell you?

809
02:10:30,875 --> 02:10:33,742
You endured everything all alone.

810
02:10:53,965 --> 02:10:55,489
Where's your mother?

811
02:10:59,437 --> 02:11:01,098
Does she live with you?

812
02:11:05,443 --> 02:11:07,502
She's no more.

813
02:11:11,515 --> 02:11:15,281
So, you're all alone?

814
02:11:22,259 --> 02:11:26,525
- You? Don't give up, do you? - When
I knew the train was cancelled...

815
02:11:26,697 --> 02:11:30,531
...I nearly died! I tried to phone
but I couldn't get through.

816
02:11:30,701 --> 02:11:32,862
I tried once or twice,
but it got cut.

817
02:11:34,205 --> 02:11:38,938
I asked to be left where I could get
a bus; I knew the train timings.

818
02:11:39,543 --> 02:11:44,207
I felt relieved when I got the bus.
But I pestered the driver!

819
02:11:44,615 --> 02:11:48,278
I said, if he didn't go fast, I'd
miss my wife, let alone the train!

820
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:52,556
- But why did you rush so?
- Yes, why did I rush?

821
02:11:53,290 --> 02:11:56,020
I'd have just sat all tensed,
and chain smoked!

822
02:11:58,496 --> 02:12:01,829
- Here you are.
- See?

823
02:12:04,468 --> 02:12:08,131
This is like a nice, beautiful wife.
Which only the lucky get!

824
02:12:09,740 --> 02:12:12,903
All night I was tense, so
I just sat and smoked.

825
02:12:13,577 --> 02:12:15,909
I've called the porter.
Shut the bag.

826
02:12:18,416 --> 02:12:21,476
- Sir... - Ah, porter. Come.
- You didn't wear a cardigan?

827
02:12:22,853 --> 02:12:26,414
- I have a shawl.
- Where? - It's...

828
02:13:04,028 --> 02:13:05,620
May I go?

829
02:13:07,731 --> 02:13:09,631
Last time I went without asking.

830
02:13:12,736 --> 02:13:14,636
This time give me permission.

831
02:13:19,643 --> 02:13:21,634
Last year I married again.

832
02:13:31,655 --> 02:13:35,557
Bless you. Be happy.

833
02:13:44,935 --> 02:13:46,664
Be happy.

834
02:13:50,274 --> 02:13:54,438
You've got a very nice husband.
Who loves you very much.

835
02:13:57,581 --> 02:13:59,242
Which I couldn't do, then.

836
02:14:02,419 --> 02:14:04,410
For God's sake, bask in it.

837
02:14:09,360 --> 02:14:13,922
If you can, forgive me with
all your heart, just once.

838
02:14:17,701 --> 02:14:19,692
What have you left behind now?

839
02:14:34,718 --> 02:14:36,709
Who was it?

840
02:14:38,122 --> 02:14:41,182
A relative? An acquaintance?

841
02:14:43,160 --> 02:14:45,151
Come on, tell me.
