1
00:00:00,177 --> 00:00:01,652
So here's what you missed on <i>Glee</i>...

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,252
<i>The cast list for</i> Greese
<i>went up and Kitty's none</i>

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,657
<i>too happy.</i>
- Ughhh!

4
00:00:04,675 --> 00:00:06,309
Who the hell is Patty Simcox?

5
00:00:06,327 --> 00:00:07,997
<i>And neither is Jake</i>
<i>because Ryder got Danny</i>

6
00:00:07,997 --> 00:00:09,965
<i>and Marley got Sandy.</i>
<i>Unique's paying Rizzo,</i>

7
00:00:09,999 --> 00:00:11,901
<i>which totally confused</i>
<i>Principal Figgins.</i>

8
00:00:11,935 --> 00:00:14,286
Unique Adams is nothing more
than an attractive, buxom young

9
00:00:14,321 --> 00:00:17,156
<i>woman who has got it going on</i>
<i>in all the right places.</i>

10
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,708
She's a brick house, Sue.

11
00:00:18,742 --> 00:00:20,393
<i>And Blaine's the Teen Angel,</i>

12
00:00:20,444 --> 00:00:22,061
<i>and he's totally broken up</i>
<i>about breaking up with Kurt.</i>

13
00:00:22,112 --> 00:00:24,012
<i>Sue's out for Finn, because</i>
<i>called her baby retarded.</i>

14
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:25,981
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to say that.

15
00:00:26,015 --> 00:00:27,850
<i>And now he's gonna take over</i>
<i>Glee Club</i>

16
00:00:27,884 --> 00:00:29,685
<i>because Will's going</i>
<i>to Washington on sabbatical.</i>

17
00:00:29,703 --> 00:00:30,953
<i>And that's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

18
00:00:34,508 --> 00:00:35,991
(school bell ringing)

19
00:00:36,025 --> 00:00:37,860
All right, guys, listen up.

20
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:39,161
I have an announcement to make.

21
00:00:39,195 --> 00:00:40,913
Adele is dd.
No.

22
00:00:40,964 --> 00:00:42,164
I have been asked to join

23
00:00:42,198 --> 00:00:43,582
a blue ribbon panel

24
00:00:43,633 --> 00:00:45,434
to rewrite the arts
curriculum nationwide.

25
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:47,369
Wow! Congratulations.
WILL: Thank you.

26
00:00:47,387 --> 00:00:49,037
I'll be taking
a short sabbatical,

27
00:00:49,056 --> 00:00:52,241
which means I'm leaving McKinley
at the end of the week.

28
00:00:53,894 --> 00:00:55,845
What? This is crazy.

29
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:57,346
But Glee Club is your life.

30
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,214
Which is why
this is only temporary.

31
00:00:59,232 --> 00:01:01,016
I'll be back
right after sectionals.

32
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,735
Wait... <i>after</i> sectionals?! Whoa!

33
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:05,554
I mean, it's not like we know.

34
00:01:05,572 --> 00:01:07,055
Guys, guys, calm down.

35
00:01:07,074 --> 00:01:08,574
Look, I knew I needed
to find a replacement,

36
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:11,226
which is why I brought in
Finn Hudson.

37
00:01:11,244 --> 00:01:14,430
Mr. Shue, Finn cannot
take over Glee Club.

38
00:01:14,464 --> 00:01:15,614
He doesn't know what
he's doing at all.

39
00:01:15,665 --> 00:01:16,782
Sorry, Finn.

40
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,534
Guys, I know I can do this.

41
00:01:18,568 --> 00:01:19,952
And I've got some really
great ideas for sectionals.

42
00:01:20,003 --> 00:01:21,370
We'll all be dead by then!
ARTIE: Tina.

43
00:01:21,404 --> 00:01:22,872
Finn doesn't know how to direct

44
00:01:22,906 --> 00:01:24,072
a musical!
No, that's fine.

45
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:25,791
No, we can't win without him.

46
00:01:25,842 --> 00:01:26,876
Who's going to drive the bus?

47
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,411
Finn Hudson, Schuester.

48
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:31,630
Figgins' office, right now.

49
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:36,752
I-I don't even understand
how you found out.

50
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,721
Oh, William, I have
the choir room bugged.

51
00:01:38,755 --> 00:01:39,922
That plaque with the
dead fat lady on it...

52
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,590
her eyes are cameras. Okay, Sue,

53
00:01:41,608 --> 00:01:44,310
this is none of your business,
and besides, I've already

54
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:46,595
cleared this with Figgins, so,
I don't see what the problem is.

55
00:01:46,613 --> 00:01:48,898
Will, of course, you don't,
because this is just

56
00:01:48,932 --> 00:01:50,983
another one of your
ill-conceived,

57
00:01:51,034 --> 00:01:52,601
bizarrely sentimental schemes

58
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,804
that displays
absolutely no forethought

59
00:01:54,838 --> 00:01:55,955
and appears
immediately ridiculous

60
00:01:55,989 --> 00:01:59,291
to everyone in America
except you.

61
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:00,910
Finn Hudson barely
graduated high school

62
00:02:00,944 --> 00:02:02,828
less than six months ago,

63
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,964
he has no bachelor's degree,
nor the certification

64
00:02:04,998 --> 00:02:06,332
to teach in the state of Ohio.

65
00:02:06,383 --> 00:02:09,135
Sue, Glee Club is not a class.

66
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:10,285
It an extracurricular activity.

67
00:02:10,303 --> 00:02:12,287
Which is why it is perfectly legal

68
00:02:12,305 --> 00:02:14,673
for Finn to volunteer
his talents temporarily.

69
00:02:14,724 --> 00:02:16,124
I promise, this is
the right thing to do.

70
00:02:16,143 --> 00:02:18,144
I can take this glee
club to sectionals,

71
00:02:18,146 --> 00:02:19,595
and I know we can win.
I'll work just as hard

72
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:22,631
as Mr. Shue does,
and do it all for free.

73
00:02:22,649 --> 00:02:25,484
Okay, let me just remind
everyone of something.

74
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:27,135
For the past year, I have
shown the glee club mercy,

75
00:02:27,154 --> 00:02:28,303
and this school has enjoyed

76
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:29,638
an unprecedented era of peace,

77
00:02:29,656 --> 00:02:31,490
but ifloaty the Gravy Clown

78
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:33,692
is allowed to take over Glee Club,

79
00:02:33,743 --> 00:02:35,661
my denté with the art in this school

80
00:02:35,695 --> 00:02:36,829
will be over.

81
00:02:40,316 --> 00:02:41,951
(Sue screams)

82
00:02:41,985 --> 00:02:43,485
Hey!

83
00:02:43,503 --> 00:02:46,872
("O Fortuna" plays)

84
00:02:46,923 --> 00:02:49,041
You're a menace
to the State of Ohio!

85
00:02:54,923 --> 00:02:57,972
<font color="#40bfff">Sync & corrections by <font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font></font>
<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

86
00:02:58,339 --> 00:02:58,816
Alright people,

87
00:02:58,835 --> 00:03:00,335
since your egregious ineptitude

88
00:03:00,353 --> 00:03:03,138
is making me lose
my will to live, I decided

89
00:03:03,172 --> 00:03:05,057
to bring in some of
my best upperclassmen

90
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:06,392
to help you up your game.

91
00:03:06,443 --> 00:03:07,693
Let's partner up.

92
00:03:07,727 --> 00:03:09,695
We're going to go
across the floor.

93
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:10,896
Let's start with some jetés.

94
00:03:10,947 --> 00:03:12,481
Hey.
Hey, how are you?

95
00:03:12,515 --> 00:03:14,149
Haven't seen you much the last.

96
00:03:14,183 --> 00:03:15,684
How have you been? I'm good.
You know, up and down.

97
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,320
Now that Finn and

98
00:03:18,354 --> 00:03:19,822
are officially-officially
broken up,

99
00:03:19,856 --> 00:03:21,156
I feel like I can just

100
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,242
focus on really why
I came to New York,

101
00:03:23,293 --> 00:03:25,694
which is my work.
Good.

102
00:03:25,712 --> 00:03:27,195
Use the floor, ladies.
Speaking of work,

103
00:03:27,214 --> 00:03:29,531
guess who go to the first
Off-Broadway play audition?

104
00:03:29,566 --> 00:03:30,833
What?

105
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:32,200
I know.
I'm really excited.

106
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:33,085
Watch your shoulder.

107
00:03:33,136 --> 00:03:34,220
So, do you know the director

108
00:03:34,254 --> 00:03:35,504
Ivan van Hoven?
Yeah.

109
00:03:35,538 --> 00:03:37,172
He's doing this, like, amazing

110
00:03:37,206 --> 00:03:38,874
avant-garde production
of The Glass Menagerie.

111
00:03:38,892 --> 00:03:40,593
It's going to be,
like, set in a zoo,

112
00:03:42,395 --> 00:03:45,380
and so, he's looking
for just a fresh face

113
00:03:45,398 --> 00:03:46,932
to play his Laura Wingfield.

114
00:03:46,983 --> 00:03:48,684
Wow, great role.

115
00:03:48,718 --> 00:03:51,437
But you're too hot play Laura.

116
00:03:58,245 --> 00:04:02,197
So, I'm going to be spending
the week just getting off book.

117
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:03,782
Hey, some advice.

118
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:05,701
You're not ready for Ivan.

119
00:04:05,735 --> 00:04:08,403
You're not tough enough yet.
You don't have enough wounds.

120
00:04:08,421 --> 00:04:10,789
Look, I auditioned
for him for ***,

121
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,592
and he made me recite
my monologue in a slip,

122
00:04:13,627 --> 00:04:15,077
standing on one foot,

123
00:04:15,095 --> 00:04:16,428
pouring tomato juice
all over myself.

124
00:04:16,463 --> 00:04:17,913
Skip it, Schwimmer.

125
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:19,932
Ivan will eat you alive.

126
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:22,718
I can take it.

127
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:25,054
And look, I was thinking,
maybe you should

128
00:04:25,088 --> 00:04:26,939
audition, too.
For Amanda Wingfield.

129
00:04:26,973 --> 00:04:30,943
You mean the faded Southern
belle who spends her haggy,

130
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,647
I thought that you maybe
might want

131
00:04:34,698 --> 00:04:35,931
to get back in the game.

132
00:04:37,317 --> 00:04:39,618
Juniors, take five.

133
00:04:39,653 --> 00:04:42,905
Freshmen... I don't know...
just, honey, do something.

134
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:45,291
Brody, sidebar.

135
00:04:45,293 --> 00:04:46,992
I'm looking for a new TA

136
00:04:47,043 --> 00:04:48,577
I think you'd be perfect,

137
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:50,796
but it's going to mean
a lot of late nights,

138
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,114
lot of time at the school,

139
00:04:52,132 --> 00:04:53,582
you're going to have
to help me prep lessons...

140
00:04:53,616 --> 00:04:55,634
Yeah, it-it doesn't matter.
I'm... I'm I.

141
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:58,420
Good decision.
We'll start this weekend.

142
00:04:58,454 --> 00:05:00,673
Uh, actually could we...
could we start on Monday?

143
00:05:00,724 --> 00:05:02,791
I-I promised Rachel that
I would help her out.

144
00:05:02,809 --> 00:05:04,927
Yeah. I understand.

145
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:07,346
Start next week.

146
00:05:07,397 --> 00:05:09,631
TINA:
Okay, hold on and suck in.

147
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:12,017
(grunts) I am.

148
00:05:12,068 --> 00:05:16,188
I don't understand.
This fit yesterday.

149
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:17,823
Maybe it's stress bloating.

150
00:05:17,857 --> 00:05:19,825
I get it all the time.
Hey.

151
00:05:19,859 --> 00:05:20,993
BOTH:
Tina.

152
00:05:21,027 --> 00:05:21,944
(laughs)

153
00:05:21,978 --> 00:05:23,445
I love it so much.

154
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:25,030
I promise I won't pee in it.

155
00:05:25,081 --> 00:05:27,315
I'm here for my fitting.
Where is Harajuku Girl?

156
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:29,985
I thought you quit because
your part was too small.

157
00:05:30,003 --> 00:05:33,339
Well, Spraed Hawk Nose,
to quote Shakespeare,

158
00:05:33,373 --> 00:05:35,674
"There's no small parts,
only fat actresses."

159
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:38,544
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I just say "fat?"

160
00:05:38,595 --> 00:05:40,328
I was distracted by Marley's

161
00:05:40,347 --> 00:05:42,548
unfortunate and very noticeable
weight gain.

162
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,522
<i>I swear, I'm not</i>
<i>eating any differently.</i>

163
00:05:50,557 --> 00:05:52,891
How is this happening?

164
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,864
I usually don't believe

165
00:05:58,898 --> 00:06:00,816
in the lamestream media's
definition of "science,"

166
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,818
but it just makes sense

167
00:06:02,852 --> 00:06:05,654
that your metabolism
is grinding to a halt.

168
00:06:05,688 --> 00:06:08,040
You're getting the body
you were destined to have.

169
00:06:08,074 --> 00:06:10,242
I had to accept how I am.

170
00:06:10,293 --> 00:06:12,194
I spend almost
every weekend alone

171
00:06:12,212 --> 00:06:14,696
because everyone just assumes
that the popular girl's busy.

172
00:06:14,714 --> 00:06:16,698
I'm doing this play because
I could use some friends.

173
00:06:16,716 --> 00:06:19,435
Real ones.

174
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:21,253
So, in the spirit of <i>Grease,</i>
I thought it would be good way

175
00:06:21,304 --> 00:06:24,339
for us to get to know each
other, if we had a sleepover.

176
00:06:24,373 --> 00:06:26,058
Sleepover?

177
00:06:26,092 --> 00:06:28,427
Tomorrow night, my place.
Just us girls.

178
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:29,845
Can I come?

179
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:32,047
I'm not going
if Unique's not invited.

180
00:06:32,082 --> 00:06:33,766
Please?
Ladyboy can come.

181
00:06:33,817 --> 00:06:36,769
Yes. But if I catch you hiding
your dinky between your legs

182
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,438
and prancing around like <i>Silence</i>
<i>of the Lambs,</i> you're out.

183
00:06:41,074 --> 00:06:42,741
(school bell rings)

184
00:06:42,776 --> 00:06:44,726
Rough day at Rydell High?

185
00:06:44,761 --> 00:06:48,914
Mom, when did yo?

186
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,067
Big?

187
00:06:53,503 --> 00:06:57,706
Well, I battled my weight
all through high school.

188
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,243
And when your daddy
and I had you,

189
00:07:01,261 --> 00:07:03,245
and I thought
that it would fix everything

190
00:07:03,263 --> 00:07:05,931
that was wrong between us,
and it didn't,

191
00:07:05,965 --> 00:07:08,884
that's when I started eating
and didn't stop.

192
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:10,269
Why are you asking me this?

193
00:07:10,271 --> 00:07:12,271
I didn't fit into my
Sandy costume again.

194
00:07:14,474 --> 00:07:17,476
Every time I try it on,
it just gets tighter.

195
00:07:19,696 --> 00:07:23,232
So, I thought maybe...

196
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:25,617
it's starting to happen to me.

197
00:07:25,652 --> 00:07:28,603
You know, my...

198
00:07:28,621 --> 00:07:30,823
my genetics.

199
00:07:30,874 --> 00:07:34,827
I didn't raise
a victim or a quitter.

200
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,612
I raised a star.

201
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:41,583
You have control
over your life and your body.

202
00:07:41,618 --> 00:07:44,620
And you are thin and beautiful.

203
00:07:44,622 --> 00:07:48,640
But you won't stay that way

204
00:07:48,675 --> 00:07:50,676
unless you fight for.

205
00:07:52,628 --> 00:07:55,964
So, starting now,

206
00:07:55,982 --> 00:07:58,934
we are <i>on a strict new diet.</i>

207
00:07:58,968 --> 00:08:01,069
Together.

208
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,160
(School bell rings)

209
00:08:08,194 --> 00:08:11,029
Uh-uh. No way. Nope.

210
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:12,164
You are not allowed in here.

211
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:17,251
Not for 19-year-old who just
got kicked out in the Army

212
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,171
and spent several months
backpacking

213
00:08:19,205 --> 00:08:20,622
through Georgia, of all places.

214
00:08:20,656 --> 00:08:22,657
I mean, it seriously
boggles the mind.

215
00:08:22,675 --> 00:08:23,825
You must have done everything

216
00:08:23,843 --> 00:08:25,294
a person could possibly do
in that state,

217
00:08:25,328 --> 00:08:26,962
including hillbilly
hand-fishing,

218
00:08:26,996 --> 00:08:28,847
and plus-sized
male prostitution.

219
00:08:28,882 --> 00:08:32,184
Look, I came here
to apologize, okay?

220
00:08:32,218 --> 00:08:34,836
I'm sorry for calling
your baby a... a retard.

221
00:08:34,871 --> 00:08:36,855
I... I'm sorry.

222
00:08:36,857 --> 00:08:39,357
That word was offensive, and
it just came out wrong, anyway.

223
00:08:41,444 --> 00:08:43,228
I think it's exactly
what you meant to say.

224
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,031
I've seen your true
colors, Finn Hudson.

225
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:48,033
You've got hate in that
heart, Double Stuff.

226
00:08:53,706 --> 00:08:57,075
Fine. I tried to apologize.

227
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:01,747
Excuse me... I got
to get to rehearsal.

228
00:09:01,798 --> 00:09:03,749
Yeah? Where do you think you're rehearsing?
The auditorium.

229
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,918
No, no, not this week,
or next week.

230
00:09:05,969 --> 00:09:08,170
You see, since you've taken
the liberty of redefining

231
00:09:08,204 --> 00:09:10,255
what it means
to be a teacher at McKinley,

232
00:09:10,306 --> 00:09:12,057
well, I took the liberty

233
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:14,092
of reserving the auditorium
for Cheerios! Practice,

234
00:09:14,143 --> 00:09:16,395
You're going to have to find some
other place to rehearse

235
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:17,679
your idiotic musical.

236
00:09:17,713 --> 00:09:19,348
I don't know.
Maybe the Moose Lodge?

237
00:09:19,382 --> 00:09:21,383
Or Hell itself.

238
00:09:29,158 --> 00:09:31,577
(whirring and clanging)

239
00:09:31,611 --> 00:09:34,029
You sure you wrote
down the right address?

240
00:09:34,063 --> 00:09:35,914
Yeah, oh, Finn works here.

241
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:38,367
And we're supposed
to rehearse here?

242
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:41,286
(sighs) Guys, it's perfect.

243
00:09:41,337 --> 00:09:44,590
Kill two birds with one stone.

244
00:09:44,624 --> 00:09:45,941
I got to overhaul this jalopy,

245
00:09:45,975 --> 00:09:47,209
and you guys need
to figure out how

246
00:09:47,243 --> 00:09:48,927
to be convincing
grease monkeys.

247
00:09:51,598 --> 00:09:54,266
I've never even changed the oil
in my car... I can't fix this.

248
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,551
I cannot believe
you got this part over me.

249
00:09:56,585 --> 00:09:59,104
Right, right.
Look, acting is about

250
00:09:59,138 --> 00:10:00,606
knowing the material, ri.

251
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,140
The themes.

252
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:05,110
So, what is <i>Grease</i> all about?

253
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:07,929
Well, it's about fixing cars

254
00:10:07,947 --> 00:10:09,948
and getting, getting grease

255
00:10:09,983 --> 00:10:12,267
under your fingernails,
and about

256
00:10:12,285 --> 00:10:17,906
signing a blood oath with
your brothers to the very end.

257
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,108
Okay, but where should we...?

258
00:10:20,126 --> 00:10:21,493
I mean, there's no stage
or anything.

259
00:10:21,544 --> 00:10:23,078
Look out there.

260
00:10:23,112 --> 00:10:25,464
Imagine an audience

261
00:10:25,498 --> 00:10:26,632
anxiously awaiting
your arrival.

262
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,450
And look up there.

263
00:10:28,468 --> 00:10:30,919
Spotlights.

264
00:10:30,953 --> 00:10:32,838
And-and look
right here...

265
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,174
And what do you see?

266
00:10:38,011 --> 00:10:39,811
An old clunker.

267
00:10:39,846 --> 00:10:43,015
Yeah, it an old clunker.

268
00:10:44,183 --> 00:10:46,351
Tell me what Danny Zuko sees.

269
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,493
It's systematic.

270
00:10:55,745 --> 00:10:56,445
It's...

271
00:10:56,479 --> 00:11:00,115
hydromatic.

272
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:02,817

Wow. Good start.

330
00:13:02,605 --> 00:13:05,073
Now, uh, let's try
it again with, like,

331
00:13:05,107 --> 00:13:06,324
double the energy.

332
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:11,361
(grunts) I can't believe

333
00:13:11,412 --> 00:13:13,613
you have a dance audition
for <i>The Glass Menagerie.</i>

334
00:13:13,647 --> 00:13:14,948
Well, Ivan is
a very physical director.

335
00:13:14,982 --> 00:13:15,949
All of his work is very

336
00:13:15,983 --> 00:13:16,950
movement-driven.
Ooh.

337
00:13:16,984 --> 00:13:18,985
Come on. Now?
Ooh, release.

338
00:13:19,003 --> 00:13:21,371
(phone vibrates) Ooh. Ow. Ugh.

339
00:13:21,422 --> 00:13:24,657
Oh. <i>Grease</i> update from Tina.
Ooh.

340
00:13:24,675 --> 00:13:26,993
Ooh. Apparently the girl
playing Sandy

341
00:13:27,011 --> 00:13:29,963
has gained so much weight,
she can't fit into her clothes.

342
00:13:29,997 --> 00:13:32,182
No. That's unfortunate.

343
00:13:32,216 --> 00:13:34,718
But it doesn't really have
anything to do with us.

344
00:13:35,937 --> 00:13:37,837
No. We're not.

345
00:13:37,855 --> 00:13:39,689
We are not going to see it.

346
00:13:39,724 --> 00:13:41,475
Not gonna see what?

347
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:43,343
What are you doing
in my studio, Schwimmer?

348
00:13:43,361 --> 00:13:45,028
Practicing for yo big audition?

349
00:13:45,063 --> 00:13:46,563
Yeah, this is actually
my roommate Kurt.

350
00:13:46,614 --> 00:13:48,482
He's helping me with it.
It's an honor

351
00:13:48,516 --> 00:13:49,516
to meet you, Ms. July, and...

352
00:13:49,534 --> 00:13:51,351
Ooh, y-you've
got some abs!

353
00:13:52,353 --> 00:13:53,737
That's sweet.

354
00:13:53,788 --> 00:13:55,072
Can you get the bar?

355
00:13:55,123 --> 00:13:57,824
So, you were saying.

356
00:13:57,858 --> 00:13:59,025
Not gonna see what?

357
00:13:59,043 --> 00:14:00,994
Her recently

358
00:14:01,028 --> 00:14:02,162
broken-up-with
ex-boyfriend is directing

359
00:14:02,196 --> 00:14:03,163
my recently broken-up-with
ex-boyfriend

360
00:14:03,197 --> 00:14:05,482
in a school production
of <i>Grease,</i>

361
00:14:05,516 --> 00:14:06,883
and we've a bunch
of friends in it,

362
00:14:06,918 --> 00:14:09,035
so we were debating
whether or not we should go.

363
00:14:09,053 --> 00:14:10,337
When I it?

364
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:11,321
This weekend.

365
00:14:11,355 --> 00:14:13,423
Oh. You need to go.

366
00:14:15,543 --> 00:14:17,377
It's a perfect opportunity
for closure.

367
00:14:17,395 --> 00:14:18,929
I have closure.

368
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,432
Okay.
Then go have fun, Schwim.

369
00:14:22,483 --> 00:14:24,884
Or go because it's <i>Grease.</i>

370
00:14:24,902 --> 00:14:27,437
Go because it's your friends,
it's your high school.

371
00:14:27,488 --> 00:14:29,906
Rachel, I'm going.
I need to see him.

372
00:14:29,941 --> 00:14:31,024
I haven't seen him since.

373
00:14:31,058 --> 00:14:32,442
I'm not sleeping.

374
00:14:32,493 --> 00:14:34,027
I'm living off of bien
and <i>The Notebook.</i>

375
00:14:34,061 --> 00:14:35,862
Please come with me.
I can't do it alone.

376
00:14:35,896 --> 00:14:37,397
Look, even if I wanted to go,
which I don't,

377
00:14:37,415 --> 00:14:38,915
we don't have the money.

378
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,067
Kurt's an intern and I spent
all of my money

379
00:14:41,085 --> 00:14:42,202
on my last trip home, so...

380
00:14:42,236 --> 00:14:43,537
CASSANDRA:
Well...

381
00:14:43,571 --> 00:14:47,374
I could give you my JetBlue
frequent flyer miles.

382
00:14:47,408 --> 00:14:48,375
I can't use them,

383
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:50,210
ever since I was
banned from my...

384
00:14:50,244 --> 00:14:52,712
Bloody Mary-fueled
panic attack

385
00:14:52,746 --> 00:14:53,964
at 30,000 feet,

386
00:14:53,998 --> 00:14:56,249
which resulted in
the hospitalization

387
00:14:56,267 --> 00:14:57,767
of three flight attendants.

388
00:14:59,587 --> 00:15:01,388
And don't go
if you don't want to.

389
00:15:01,422 --> 00:15:02,422
But I just think you'll

390
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,690
regret missing it.

391
00:15:06,194 --> 00:15:07,894
Here's my
first-place trophy

392
00:15:07,928 --> 00:15:10,564
for "Most Tongues Spoken"
at Bible camp.

393
00:15:10,598 --> 00:15:12,765
And this is Mr. Jo Jo.

394
00:15:12,783 --> 00:15:15,569
I rode him for six years
until he broke my hymen.

395
00:15:15,603 --> 00:15:17,070
(knocking on door)

396
00:15:17,104 --> 00:15:18,905
Triple-layer
fudge cake, yo!

397
00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:20,574
TINA:
Kettle Corn and pizza!

398
00:15:20,608 --> 00:15:22,275
UNIQUE:
And chocolate donuts!

399
00:15:22,293 --> 00:15:25,745
Unique loves her delicious,
chocolatey Krispy Kreme...

400
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:27,664
Dig in, everybody, and then
we'll have pillow fights

401
00:15:27,715 --> 00:15:30,450
and ghost stories
and prayer circles

402
00:15:30,468 --> 00:15:31,668
and back rubs.

403
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:33,253
Want a donut, Marley?

404
00:15:33,287 --> 00:15:34,921
Are there any healthy snacks?

405
00:15:34,955 --> 00:15:36,623
You can eat Kleenex.
They taste like clouds.

406
00:15:36,641 --> 00:15:38,975
Honey, we need to
have a little talk.

407
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,594
Hey, that's mine.

408
00:15:40,628 --> 00:15:43,096
(girls chattering)

409
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,797
Okay.

410
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:47,634
These are called fingers.

411
00:15:47,652 --> 00:15:49,436
Just stick them
in your pie hole

412
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:52,088
and bingo, you're magically
supermodel-thin forever.

413
00:15:52,123 --> 00:15:55,342
I don't want to make myself
vomit... that's gross.

414
00:15:55,376 --> 00:15:56,526
You know what's more gross?

415
00:15:56,561 --> 00:15:57,944
Having your gelatinous,
corpulent,

416
00:15:57,978 --> 00:15:59,613
six-ton stomach explode

417
00:15:59,647 --> 00:16:02,315
blood and pudding and sour
cream and chili cheese fries

418
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,950
just because you didn't
love yourself enough

419
00:16:03,984 --> 00:16:05,318
to binge and purge.

420
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,321
Do you do it?

421
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:10,823
I would if I was born
with the fat gene.

422
00:16:10,841 --> 00:16:13,627
And let's be real, you weren't
just born with the fat gene,

423
00:16:13,661 --> 00:16:16,996
you were born with the circus
fat gene... no offense.

424
00:16:17,014 --> 00:16:19,266
Just think about it.

425
00:16:21,335 --> 00:16:26,339
(girls chattering)

426
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,897
Hey.

427
00:16:33,948 --> 00:16:35,031
Where's Marley?

428
00:16:35,066 --> 00:16:36,516
Why, I'm right here,

429
00:16:36,534 --> 00:16:38,685
wearing my signature
<i>Newsies</i> cap

430
00:16:38,703 --> 00:16:40,019
with my mud brown hair.

431
00:16:40,037 --> 00:16:41,321
I'm gonna bat my
bargain-basement eyes

432
00:16:41,355 --> 00:16:43,189
and steal your boyfriends,

433
00:16:43,207 --> 00:16:46,626

Some people are so touchy.

463
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,840
(school bell rings)

464
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:26,426
You wanted to see me?

465
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,978
Finn Hudson,

466
00:18:29,013 --> 00:18:30,747
this is Rob and Betty Adams.

467
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:32,182
I took the liberty
of calling them

468
00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:33,433
to congratulate them

469
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:35,151
on their son landing

470
00:18:35,186 --> 00:18:37,170
the big role of Rizzo in <i>Grease,</i>

471
00:18:37,204 --> 00:18:38,988
and lo and behold,

472
00:18:39,023 --> 00:18:40,657
it was the first
they'd heard of it.

473
00:18:40,691 --> 00:18:43,159
Look, ever since Wade
was a little boy,

474
00:18:43,194 --> 00:18:44,294
we knew that he was different.

475
00:18:44,328 --> 00:18:45,779
Most little boys don't want

476
00:18:45,813 --> 00:18:47,664
to dress as Shirley Hemphill
for Halloween.

477
00:18:47,698 --> 00:18:49,449
I mean, it's just so specific.

478
00:18:49,483 --> 00:18:51,334
MRS. ADAMS:
When Wade performed as a girl

479
00:18:51,369 --> 00:18:53,286
at Nationals,
we were really proud.

480
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,721
MR. ADAMS:
But Chicago is a very

481
00:18:54,755 --> 00:18:57,207
liberal city... I mean,
we live in Ohio, and...

482
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,343
...to be perfectly honest,

483
00:19:00,378 --> 00:19:02,011
we're worried about
Wade's safety.

484
00:19:02,046 --> 00:19:03,329
I think you're overreacting.

485
00:19:03,347 --> 00:19:06,049
Are we?
Well, I've personally seen you

486
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,967
physically assaulted
in the hallway.

487
00:19:08,001 --> 00:19:09,502
This concerns me.

488
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,721
Wait, is that true?

489
00:19:14,058 --> 00:19:17,110
Ooh, put some pants
on, Mo'Nique!

490
00:19:19,847 --> 00:19:20,847
We're pulling Wade
out of the play,

491
00:19:20,865 --> 00:19:23,133
and we're asking Wade

492
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:24,851
not to dress like a girl
during school hours.

493
00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:26,653
MRS. ADAMS:
Once he gets home, he can be

494
00:19:26,687 --> 00:19:28,405
whoever he wants to be.

495
00:19:28,456 --> 00:19:32,859
Wade Adams, you can return to your
sewing exam in Home Ec.

496
00:19:37,214 --> 00:19:39,532
I can't believe you would do
something like this.

497
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:42,201
You mean do something like
conveniently protect the welfare

498
00:19:42,219 --> 00:19:44,721
of a student, so that it just
happens to derail

499
00:19:44,755 --> 00:19:46,756
the school musical?
I think that sounds exactly

500
00:19:46,807 --> 00:19:49,759
like something I'd do...
classic Sue Sylvester.

501
00:19:49,794 --> 00:19:51,561
If you don't have a Rizzo,
you don't have a show.

502
00:19:51,595 --> 00:19:53,897
Well, who says I can't find
another Rizzo?

503
00:19:53,931 --> 00:19:56,266
Hmm?
Me.

504
00:19:58,102 --> 00:20:00,219
Of course I can play Rizzo.

505
00:20:00,237 --> 00:20:01,738
(sighs) Are you sure?

506
00:20:01,772 --> 00:20:03,523
We open tomorrow and we
just gave you the script.

507
00:20:03,557 --> 00:20:05,408
I was born to play this role.
I've known it by heart

508
00:20:05,443 --> 00:20:06,860
since I was one, Artie, come on.

509
00:20:06,894 --> 00:20:08,528
So, what are you doing
in town, Santana?

510
00:20:08,562 --> 00:20:09,946
Shut up. Who cares?

511
00:20:09,997 --> 00:20:11,247
Yeah, the important thing
is that

512
00:20:11,282 --> 00:20:12,916
she's here, so the show
can go on.

513
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,868
This one fits. I just looked
at the lines for Rizzo,

514
00:20:14,902 --> 00:20:16,402
and I think I can
be off-book by Friday.

515
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,404
I may have to hold a script
in the second act.

516
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,758
Sorry, Tina...
I called Santana.

517
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:23,960
She was the obvious choice
to me.

518
00:20:24,011 --> 00:20:27,547
And if you played Rizzo,
then we wouldn't have a Jan.

519
00:20:27,581 --> 00:20:30,590
You have got to be kidding me.

520
00:20:40,228 --> 00:20:42,479
All right, well, just remember,
no matter how many times

521
00:20:42,514 --> 00:20:44,732
people ask, we have to stick
to our five autograph limit.

522
00:20:44,766 --> 00:20:47,067
Right. I'm more concerned about
running into you-know-who.

523
00:20:47,102 --> 00:20:48,686
You'll be fine.

524
00:20:48,737 --> 00:20:53,307
Oh, look, it's your locker
next to my locker.

525
00:20:53,325 --> 00:20:54,825
Remember that time you got out
of that date

526
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:55,993
th Mercedes by saying that you

527
00:20:56,027 --> 00:20:57,411
had a thing for me?
Oh.

528
00:20:57,445 --> 00:20:59,029
Yeah, it still burns
my ass to this day.

529
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,165
Yes!
Honey.

530
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:02,816
Oh, my God, guys.

531
00:21:02,834 --> 00:21:04,835
It's amazing you guys
came to see the musical.

532
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:07,504
Look, these kids are ready
to bring the house down.

533
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:08,756
How are you?
Tell us everything.

534
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,424
Oh, life is crazy busy.

535
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,543
You know, it's not easy
balancing UCLA classes

536
00:21:12,594 --> 00:21:14,545
and recording backup vocals

537
00:21:14,596 --> 00:21:16,013
or having Puckerman
always hit me up

538
00:21:16,047 --> 00:21:17,331
for sugar mamas' phone numbers.

539
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:18,515
But life is good.
Good.

540
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,050
Oh, you guys have to
come backstage and say hi.

541
00:21:20,101 --> 00:21:23,337
They're gonna freak
when they see who's here.

542
00:21:23,355 --> 00:21:25,356
Tina!

543
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:28,392
I'm sorry... I've been starving
myself all week.

544
00:21:28,443 --> 00:21:30,194
How could you have gained
two inches in one day?

545
00:21:30,228 --> 00:21:33,013
I don't know. Maybe we can
hot glue an elastic band on.

546
00:21:33,031 --> 00:21:35,232
Marley, do not worry.
We're gonna get those

547
00:21:35,283 --> 00:21:37,451
two inches off you
before curtain.

548
00:21:37,485 --> 00:21:39,036
Scout's honor.

549
00:21:42,457 --> 00:21:44,875
(bell dinging)

550
00:21:48,296 --> 00:21:49,413
Kurt?

551
00:21:49,464 --> 00:21:51,382
I-I didn't

552
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:53,550
think I'd see you this weekend.

553
00:21:53,585 --> 00:21:54,885
We wouldn't miss it
for the world.

554
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:56,003
Would we Kurt?

555
00:21:57,639 --> 00:21:59,139
Rachel.

556
00:22:00,141 --> 00:22:01,342
Finn, hey.

557
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,594
How are you?

558
00:22:03,645 --> 00:22:04,895
Good. A little...

559
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:06,730
surprised to see you, but...

560
00:22:06,765 --> 00:22:09,733
I'm gonna go put the kids
through their warm-up.

561
00:22:12,687 --> 00:22:14,388
How are you?

562
00:22:14,406 --> 00:22:15,773
I'm good. I'm really good.

563
00:22:15,824 --> 00:22:17,441
Just... busy and...

564
00:22:17,492 --> 00:22:19,109
Rachel has her first
big audition

565
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,611
for an
off-Broadway show next week.

566
00:22:20,662 --> 00:22:22,780
Wow.

567
00:22:22,831 --> 00:22:25,082
That's awesome.
Congratulations.

568
00:22:25,116 --> 00:22:26,450
Thanks.

569
00:22:31,122 --> 00:22:34,124
Look, this is... this is
really, really weird, Mm-hmm.

570
00:22:34,175 --> 00:22:35,509
But the four of us had

571
00:22:35,543 --> 00:22:37,261
a lot of history between us,

572
00:22:37,295 --> 00:22:39,430
so I just want to say...

573
00:22:39,464 --> 00:22:41,432
it's cool you came
to see our show.

574
00:22:53,895 --> 00:22:55,095
You were right.

575
00:22:55,113 --> 00:22:56,930
It was a mistake to come.

576
00:22:56,948 --> 00:22:58,866
I'm not gonna get direct to you.
Oh, no.

577
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,867
Look, you're gonna
be fine, all right?

578
00:22:59,901 --> 00:23:01,151
I'm gonna be sitting
right next to you.

579
00:23:01,202 --> 00:23:03,537
And we're gonna be
holding hands and laughing

580
00:23:03,571 --> 00:23:05,038
and applauding,
and we are never, ever

581
00:23:05,073 --> 00:23:06,373
gonna let them see us sweat.

582
00:23:06,408 --> 00:23:09,126
Okay?

Marley, stop.

636
00:25:57,362 --> 00:25:59,379
Why are you doing that?

637
00:25:59,414 --> 00:26:02,466
(crying)

638
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,051

00:26:04,085 --> 00:26:07,204
My mom's the town joke,

640
00:26:07,238 --> 00:26:10,123
and I'm going to end up
just like her.

641
00:26:10,141 --> 00:26:11,475
Well, sticking your fingers
down your throat

642
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:12,726
is only gonna
make things worse.

643
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,977
Spare me the lecture.

644
00:26:14,012 --> 00:26:15,228
I've seen the health films.

645
00:26:15,263 --> 00:26:17,064
Okay.

646
00:26:17,098 --> 00:26:19,566
Then Google "Johnny Pappas."

647
00:26:19,601 --> 00:26:20,817
He's my second cousin.

648
00:26:20,852 --> 00:26:22,019
He was a wrestler
at Bowling Green,

649
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,236
and the coach was always
making him drop weight.

650
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:25,072
So Johnny did
all the crazy diets

651
00:26:25,106 --> 00:26:27,157
and puked every day

652
00:26:27,191 --> 00:26:30,911
when that stopped working,
he used laxatives.

653
00:26:30,945 --> 00:26:33,363
Then last March, in the
middle of a match...

654
00:26:33,414 --> 00:26:35,015
He died?

655
00:26:36,834 --> 00:26:39,086
He crapped himself in front
of the whole school.

656
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,505
(both laughing)

657
00:26:45,793 --> 00:26:48,211
I would never use laxatives.

658
00:26:48,262 --> 00:26:49,429
Well, I don't want
to kiss a girl

659
00:26:49,464 --> 00:26:50,664
who's got puke on her breath.

660
00:26:50,698 --> 00:26:55,102
Either on stage... or later.

661
00:26:56,854 --> 00:27:00,374
Now, come on, we're on in five.

662
00:27:00,408 --> 00:27:01,608

(laughing) Mm.

678
00:28:15,272 --> 00:28:16,806
Hello.
Hi.

679
00:28:16,857 --> 00:28:19,191
I'm really so glad you came back
to play Rizzo.

680
00:28:19,226 --> 00:28:20,810
I feel bad for Mercedes,

681
00:28:20,861 --> 00:28:22,445
but if her parents want her
to be a boy

682
00:28:22,479 --> 00:28:23,896
then, I don't know,
I guess it makes sense.

683
00:28:25,315 --> 00:28:28,484
I miss you.

684
00:28:28,535 --> 00:28:30,653
I miss you, too.

685
00:28:30,704 --> 00:28:32,872
The only reason why I
agreed to do this play

686
00:28:32,906 --> 00:28:34,156
was so that I could see you again.

687
00:28:36,209 --> 00:28:40,129
Well, I'm not dating anybody
new, boy or girl.

688
00:28:40,163 --> 00:28:42,631
Brit, we talked about this.

689
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:45,801
And it would be fine
if you were...

690
00:28:45,836 --> 00:28:48,337
I'm glad that you're not.

691
00:28:50,424 --> 00:28:52,141
60 seconds, Miss Lopez.

692
00:28:52,175 --> 00:28:53,476
(both chuckle)

693
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,227
Ms. Lopez.

694
00:28:55,262 --> 00:28:58,147
Are you nervous
about your big number?

695
00:28:58,181 --> 00:29:00,816
Oh, God, no, come on,
it's all about the attitude.

696
00:29:00,851 --> 00:29:02,651
I'm just going to do what
I did with "America"

697
00:29:02,686 --> 00:29:03,986
in <i>West Side Story</i> last year.

698
00:29:04,021 --> 00:29:06,439
Yeah, but this is,
like, a sad song, right?

699
00:29:06,473 --> 00:29:07,823
So you have to think
of something

700
00:29:07,858 --> 00:29:09,775
that makes you,
like, really sad.

701
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:11,494
Like how we're not together
anymore, and it's okay,

702
00:29:11,528 --> 00:29:15,147
but it still hurts
a little bit.

703
00:29:15,165 --> 00:29:17,700
Especially on Fridays,
'cause that was our date night.

704
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:22,338
Good luck.

Tina, you were
incredible as Jan.

733
00:31:42,979 --> 00:31:44,980
Finn was right... no one could
play this part better than you.

734
00:31:45,015 --> 00:31:48,434
You know, this last week,
I've been thinking...

735
00:31:48,468 --> 00:31:50,186
maybe we shouldn't
have broken up.

736
00:31:50,237 --> 00:31:52,438
Maybe it was premature.

737
00:31:52,472 --> 00:31:55,324
Maybe, but... we did.

738
00:31:55,358 --> 00:31:57,976
And it really tested who I am.

739
00:31:57,994 --> 00:32:00,613
And I'm <i>liking</i> who I am.

740
00:32:00,647 --> 00:32:03,782
But I miss you, too,

741
00:32:03,817 --> 00:32:08,153
so... we can talk about it.

742
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,680
Whoa.

743
00:32:17,714 --> 00:32:19,632
I mean...

744
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:20,716
Whoa.

745
00:32:20,767 --> 00:32:22,384
Are you sure?

746
00:32:22,435 --> 00:32:24,687
This doesn't look ridiculous?

747
00:32:24,721 --> 00:32:27,223
Not the word that comes to mind.

748
00:32:27,274 --> 00:32:28,724
It's just so tight.

749
00:32:28,775 --> 00:32:30,309

Fletcher Mantini.

754
00:32:38,985 --> 00:32:40,686
He's in the audience.

755
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:42,154
Who's that?

756
00:32:42,188 --> 00:32:43,872
He's the theater critic

757
00:32:43,907 --> 00:32:45,524
for <i>The McKinley Muckraker.</i>
He hates everything,

758
00:32:45,542 --> 00:32:47,042
and his brutal deconstruction

I-I don't understand.

829
00:36:31,177 --> 00:36:34,680
Uh, let's see... you blew off

830
00:36:34,682 --> 00:36:37,099
your playdate with the hottest
piece of ass at NY

831
00:36:37,133 --> 00:36:39,134

your loser ex-boyfriend.

832
00:36:39,168 --> 00:36:42,104
Said hot ass was
lonely, distraught,

833
00:36:42,138 --> 00:36:43,689
didn't know what
to do with himself,

834
00:36:43,723 --> 00:36:46,007
and was more than happy
to come help me choreograph

835
00:36:46,025 --> 00:36:47,675
a new routine when I called him up,

836
00:36:47,694 --> 00:36:49,528
and then one thing led
to another

837
00:36:49,562 --> 00:36:52,180
and next thing you know he's
at my place and, you know...

838
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:56,618
So... you and Brody.

00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:01,156
Why don't we consider this

842
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,358
one of those little
nasty life lessons?

843
00:37:03,376 --> 00:37:05,460
Auditioning
for an off-Broadway play,

844
00:37:05,495 --> 00:37:08,029
throwing yourself
at an upperclassman,

845
00:37:08,047 --> 00:37:12,167

to get back in the game.

<i>I</i> need to get back in the game?

847
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,703
I think you were overreaching

848
00:37:15,722 --> 00:37:17,839
and needed a little bit
of a reminder.

849
00:37:17,873 --> 00:37:21,042

you came to
with every little problem.

857
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:51,467

we're not even friends anymore?

858

I just... I shouldn't have come here.

859
00:37:54,754 --> 00:37:56,055
It's just... it's too weird.

860
00:37:56,089 --> 00:37:57,056

861
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:58,257

862
00:37:59,426 --> 00:38:00,726

864
00:38:03,146 --> 00:38:07,066

Believe me, the whole 
time I was directing it,

869
00:38:14,274 --> 00:38:17,827
I was basically thinking,
what would Rachel do?

870
00:38:17,861 --> 00:38:19,461

00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:24,399
I know.

873
00:38:24,417 --> 00:38:26,952
Just wanted to see you smile.

874
00:38:27,003 --> 00:38:29,171
Will you tell me what
you're so upset about?

875
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:31,957
I'd rather not.

876
00:38:32,008 --> 00:38:33,626
Were you crying about me?

877
00:38:33,677 --> 00:38:36,078
I wasn't crying about you.

878
00:38:36,096 --> 00:38:38,113
Oh.

879
00:38:39,649 --> 00:38:41,600
It's about him, isn't it?

880
00:38:41,635 --> 00:38:43,602
Brody?

881
00:38:43,637 --> 00:38:45,921
I-I just didn't think
you'd move on that fast.

882
00:38:45,939 --> 00:38:47,489
You don't know that.
I know you.

883
00:38:47,524 --> 00:38:49,925
I know you have four
different kinds of crying.

884
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,810
You've got the fake crying
when you want something,

885
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:54,480
which always involves a tissue,

886
00:38:54,531 --> 00:38:56,448
you've got the singing crying,
which this can't be,

887
00:38:56,483 --> 00:38:58,968
the disappointed crying,
which involves sobbing,

888
00:38:59,002 --> 00:39:00,786
and the crying over a guy,

889
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:04,557
which I know very well because
it used to be reserved for me.

890
00:39:08,912 --> 00:39:10,880
Told you we shouldn't
talk about this.

891
00:39:10,914 --> 00:39:13,332
Well, maybe we shouldn't talk
about anything anymore.

892
00:39:14,551 --> 00:39:16,502
Is that really what you want?

893
00:39:16,553 --> 00:39:17,670
Yeah.

894
00:39:19,923 --> 00:39:23,492
No contact, not even in song.

895
00:39:25,178 --> 00:39:27,129
When you come back
to visit, I...

896
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:29,481
I don't want to know about it.

897
00:39:29,516 --> 00:39:33,986
Yeah, I think that's good.

898
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,688
You know, I don't really
know what's going

899
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,356
to happen between us but...,

900
00:39:37,407 --> 00:39:39,808
I know that you used to be
the guy who would make me feel

901
00:39:39,826 --> 00:39:44,029
like the most special girl
in the whole world,

902
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,482
and it doesn't feel
that way anymore.

903
00:39:46,516 --> 00:39:52,504
Now it just feels...
sad and confusing.

904
00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:54,173
And the worst part is

905
00:39:54,207 --> 00:39:56,592
is that doesn't even really feel
that bad anymore.

906
00:39:58,578 --> 00:40:01,163
Made you cry, and...

907
00:40:01,197 --> 00:40:03,182
this doesn't.

908
00:40:04,467 --> 00:40:06,435
Hey.

909
00:40:06,469 --> 00:40:08,053
Mr. Schuester said
he wanted

910
00:40:08,104 --> 00:40:10,105
to see you in the choir room.

911
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,774
Bye.

912
00:40:14,527 --> 00:40:16,729
Are you ok?
I just want to go home.

913
00:40:16,731 --> 00:40:20,566
I thought this was home.
Doesn't feel like it anymore.

914
00:40:20,617 --> 00:40:22,868
Kurt, I need to talk to you.

915
00:40:22,902 --> 00:40:25,788
RACHEL:
You okay?

916
00:40:25,822 --> 00:40:27,623
I'm not interested.

917
00:40:27,657 --> 00:40:31,210
I-I never told you about
what happened.

918
00:40:31,244 --> 00:40:32,962
The guy that
I hooked up with...

919
00:40:32,996 --> 00:40:34,630
I need you to know everything.

920
00:40:34,664 --> 00:40:36,915
What are you gonna tell me,
that it wasn't serious?

921
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,751
That you only made out?

922
00:40:38,802 --> 00:40:40,886
That you didn't care about him?
I didn't care.

923
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,255
Do you think any of that
matters to me?

924
00:40:43,306 --> 00:40:46,041
Relationships are about trust...

925
00:40:46,059 --> 00:40:47,476
and I don't trust you anymore.

926
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,228
I was stupid to come back.

927
00:40:49,262 --> 00:40:53,182
Rachel's right,
this isn't home anymore.

928
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,607
"Watching the skill, the nuance,"

929
00:41:01,658 --> 00:41:03,575
"this reviewer was forced
to ask himself,"

930
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,411
'Is this not how it felt.

931
00:41:08,248 --> 00:41:12,234
'And might the directing team of
Mr. Hudson and Mr. Abrams

932
00:41:12,252 --> 00:41:13,836
be headed for careers at NASA?'

933
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,754
"They should be,
because last night

934
00:41:15,789 --> 00:41:17,790
"they plucked stars
from the firmament

935
00:41:17,841 --> 00:41:19,908
"and named them Marley Rose
and Ryder Lynn.

936
00:41:19,926 --> 00:41:23,245
Has ever an audience been
so enraptured? Mayhap.

937
00:41:23,263 --> 00:41:26,248
"But when the last breath of life
crosses this reviewer's lips,"

938
00:41:26,266 --> 00:41:27,683
"it shall utter but three words:"

939
00:41:27,717 --> 00:41:30,102
<i>'Grease,</i> McKinley,

940
00:41:30,136 --> 00:41:31,136
"Bravo.'"

941
00:41:31,187 --> 00:41:33,455
(cheering, whooping)

942
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:35,107
Whoo!
Whoo!

943
00:41:35,141 --> 00:41:36,591
Guys, Fletcher Mantini's
just a sophomore,

944
00:41:36,609 --> 00:41:38,260
but he's a notoriously 
tough critic.

945
00:41:38,278 --> 00:41:41,263
And that's what I call
a rave review.

946
00:41:41,281 --> 00:41:43,615
(all cheer, applaud)

947
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:48,620
Man, this week hasn't been easy,
knowing it was the last time

948
00:41:48,655 --> 00:41:50,205
I was gonna see you guys
for a while.

949
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,157
But one thing that's
helped is knowing that

950
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:54,543
I'm leaving you in good hands.
Here's one person who loves

951
00:41:54,577 --> 00:41:56,378
the Glee Club as much as I do,
it's Finn.

952
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:58,947
And I know in my heart
that he has what it takes

953
00:41:58,965 --> 00:42:00,466
to get you guys a win
at sectionals.

954
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:04,053
I have so much
to thank you guys for.

955
00:42:06,806 --> 00:42:11,427
But for giving me this chance
to share that joy with others.

956
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:16,631
I'm gonna see you guys
in a few months,

957
00:42:16,649 --> 00:42:18,967
but hopefully, there'll he
a brand-new sectionals trophy

958
00:42:18,985 --> 00:42:20,152
in that case over there.

959
00:42:21,571 --> 00:42:23,989
I love you guys.

960
00:42:24,023 --> 00:42:26,658
I'm really gonna miss you.

961
00:42:29,162 --> 00:42:31,029
I'm serious... you can call me
anytime, day or night.

962
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:34,583
I know.
You okay?

963
00:42:34,617 --> 00:42:37,369
Yeah. You okay?

964
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,037
Yeah.

965
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:41,656
Oh, one more thing:
For sectionals,

966
00:42:41,674 --> 00:42:43,041
don't be afraid to open
with a ballad.

967
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:44,993
Yeah, sure we got
a lot of great dancers now,

968
00:42:45,011 --> 00:42:46,995
but the judges at sectionals
always reward the best singers.

969
00:42:47,013 --> 00:42:48,263
So what you gotta do...

970
00:42:48,298 --> 00:42:50,999
Mr. Shue, I got this.

971
00:42:51,017 --> 00:42:53,385
(sighs)

972
00:42:53,436 --> 00:42:55,471
Yeah.

973
00:43:03,062 --> 00:43:04,029
Go get 'em.

974
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:06,365
You, too.

975
