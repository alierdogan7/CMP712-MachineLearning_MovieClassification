00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:23,049
Story, about to be told, is not some
random fact... but whole truth.

CRIME AND PUNISHMENT

3
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:39,724
August 21, 1927; 8:05 AM, apartment of
department store manager G.I. Gorbushkin

4
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:56,836
- Oh, dear, oh-oh-oh!
- What’s up?

5
00:03:56,871 --> 00:04:04,004
- What is going on?!
- Your whining makes me sick!

6
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:08,120
- Well?
- Oh well!...

7
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:15,981
They give you 10 years
for embezzlement!

8
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:20,182
And what has this to do with you?
Why are you wooping?

9
00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:24,905
But... but did
I say it had something to do with me?

10
00:04:25,076 --> 00:04:31,598
I am just saying! For embezzlement...
Ha... 10 years!

11
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:35,039
Do you embezzle?
Just think about it:

12
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,340
once a year you bring poor products
and you can’t read the papers!

13
00:04:37,408 --> 00:04:41,185
- He’s dreaming jail!
- Ha, some fool!...

14
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:47,334
Other managers keep bringing, bringing...
Nowhere to put the stuff!

15
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:52,093
Don’t I keep bringing? Do I, in your
opinion, just keep sniffing roses?

16
00:04:52,094 --> 00:04:53,094
You do.

17
00:04:53,552 --> 00:04:58,713
And what is this? And this?

18
00:04:59,783 --> 00:05:03,983
And here? What is here?

19
00:05:03,984 --> 00:05:09,035
What are you wearing?
Eh, some fool!

20
00:05:11,205 --> 00:05:15,778
Ten years for embezzlement!

21
00:05:28,597 --> 00:05:34,160
Don’t be afraid, people! Which one
of you is citizen Gorbushkin?

22
00:05:34,195 --> 00:05:38,575
Him. He is Gorbushkin.

23
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,400
Be so kind and come with me.
Get ready.

24
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:51,416
-What for? -Investigator knows what for.
- Ah... investigator.

25
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:54,265
Get ready.

26
00:07:12,055 --> 00:07:15,650
Make haste.

27
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:22,459
Will you let me bid farewell?!

28
00:07:28,277 --> 00:07:32,225
Well, it’s time, it’s time.

29
00:07:34,338 --> 00:07:40,072
I am ready, take me there.

30
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:39,103
Farewell, Anna!

31
00:08:42,473 --> 00:08:45,056
9:15 AM
New Linden square

32
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:55,790
<i>It’s long since I’ve understood
where death hides.</i>

33
00:08:55,791 --> 00:09:00,091
<i>Nobody drowns in beer,
all of them drown in water.</i>

34
00:09:00,425 --> 00:09:06,809
<i>Rivers, seas, channels.
How much evil they do!</i>

35
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:12,410
<i>Beer doesn’t ruin people,
water ruins people!</i>

36
00:09:13,644 --> 00:09:19,810
<i>Beer doesn’t ruin people,
water ruins people.</i>

37
00:09:19,845 --> 00:09:32,661
<i>In our job, let’s say, my friend,
I just once watered down beer.</i>

38
00:09:32,696 --> 00:09:38,555
<i>And, with a wry smile,
he shouted at day of trial:</i>

39
00:09:38,556 --> 00:09:44,556
<i>Beer doesn’t ruin people,
water ruins people!</i>

40
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:51,844
<i>Beer doesn’t ruin people,
water ruins people!</i>

41
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:57,490
<i>If you’re mentally hurt,
if you’re in trouble</i>

42
00:09:57,691 --> 00:10:03,591
<i>you don’t go to bath;
You come here.</i>

43
00:10:04,725 --> 00:10:10,987
<i>Here you take a happy breath, clear
your throat happily, and say: Ye-es!</i>

44
00:10:11,022 --> 00:10:24,114
<i>Beer doesn’t ruin people,
water ruins people.</i>

45
00:10:54,785 --> 00:10:59,700
- Oh, who is this?! - What are you
afraid of, Marya Vasilyevna?

46
00:10:59,735 --> 00:11:03,977
Don’t you recognize your neighbour?

47
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:08,437
Vitaliy Borisovich!

48
00:11:08,978 --> 00:11:18,024
- Where have you gotten up to?
- Oh, just to see what’s going on.

49
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:26,148
Yes. When such things happen you will
crawl up. I see your husband escorted…

50
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,219
I think I should come in
and calm down the lady…

51
00:11:33,461 --> 00:11:37,932
- There haven’t been any search yet?
- No, there hasn’t. - There will be one!

52
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:42,292
- Really? -Sure. Do you remember
Schukin, who stole?

53
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:46,618
- Search and total confiscation of property!
- Oh, total?!

54
00:11:46,653 --> 00:11:48,095
The most total!

55
00:11:54,196 --> 00:11:59,850
- So there is something to worry about.
- Yes, really.

56
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:06,216
- Brother, oh…
- What’s up? Who is this?

57
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:10,824
- A neighbour.
- Came to calm down the lady.

58
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:16,566
Why was Gorbuskin taken?
On what basis, just talk fast!

59
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:20,981
- I don’t know myself.
- Well, drop your joking... she doesn’t know.

60
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:25,075
- What things did he have? Well?
- Sure, he had.

61
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,799
That’s bad.
We must think of something fast.

62
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:33,087
- I understand total confiscation of
property may take place. -What?

63
00:12:33,122 --> 00:12:38,941
- Total confiscation of property!
- Well, I say we must act in full gear.

64
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:44,505
- Sell all property right away!
- All property really?

65
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,681
- I suppose you should sell every single item.
- Provisions, for example, I could buy.

66
00:12:48,716 --> 00:12:51,814
Provisions are not for sale.
I take them.

67
00:12:51,849 --> 00:12:58,252
- Then, maybe, textiles?
- Nyusha, show him coat and costumes.

68
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:02,197
- They fill fit him fine.
- Alright.

69
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:09,104
I will look around neighbourhood.
Sell all property and fast.

70
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:11,729
Well, let’s get right to costumes.

71
00:13:17,115 --> 00:13:19,404
9:30AM
Near procurator's office.

72
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:35,478
- Citizen Gorbushkin!
- Oh, Lord...

73
00:13:42,536 --> 00:13:49,795
- Citizen Gorbushkin has been brought.
- Good day! -Have a seat.

74
00:13:54,817 --> 00:14:00,449
- Could I? One sip.
- Be my guest.

75
00:14:21,369 --> 00:14:24,975
Just a moment.

76
00:15:09,423 --> 00:15:14,531
- Anna, did this hobo pay?
- I did. Don’t worry.

77
00:15:14,566 --> 00:15:18,180
Paid, paid... phew!

78
00:15:34,382 --> 00:15:36,670
Give the money here.
Why should you hold it in hand?

79
00:15:37,086 --> 00:15:40,872
- Oh, nothing, I’d hold it. -Complete
swiftness is needed, Nyusha. Well, then...

80
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:46,865
The one-eyed will take all furniture now.
That which... and this...

81
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:56,309
Pictures... A man will take animals.
This here hobo has already taken clothes.

82
00:15:56,344 --> 00:16:00,287
And I will take something.

83
00:16:00,322 --> 00:16:06,773
I won’t desert you.
As much as I can.

84
00:16:07,623 --> 00:16:13,749
- I will help... Damn!... It’s nothing.
- Thank you, brother!

85
00:16:13,784 --> 00:16:18,687
- You’re welcome. - What is this?
Belongings disappearing right before my eyes.

86
00:16:18,722 --> 00:16:26,984
You, sister, may not grasp it.
Man has fallen for case this grave...

87
00:16:27,957 --> 00:16:33,473
Not a minute can be lost!

88
00:16:33,508 --> 00:16:41,188
Well, they can come but you have nothing.
Wife in total poverty!

89
00:16:41,223 --> 00:16:44,740
Sitting on plain bed. In a shirt!

90
00:16:44,775 --> 00:16:48,478
- How are you dressed?!
- What?

91
00:16:48,513 --> 00:16:52,792
How are you dressed?! Oh, Lord!

92
00:16:52,827 --> 00:16:57,071
Slip into dark dress, just fast.

93
00:16:57,552 --> 00:17:00,521
- It looks poorer.
- Oh, well...

94
00:17:13,494 --> 00:17:19,433
- Thirty, thirty fife, for...
- Eh, take it all!

95
00:17:20,695 --> 00:17:25,200
- But the dog?
- Take it, just fast!

96
00:17:25,235 --> 00:17:28,690
Ah, ah, well...

97
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:33,117
10:01AM
Investigator's office

98
00:17:33,807 --> 00:17:39,127
Citizen Gorbushin, we have summoned you
in connection with case of certain Schukin...

99
00:17:39,162 --> 00:17:41,555
To be a witness.

100
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:48,476
Oh! A witness!

101
00:17:48,511 --> 00:17:53,965
What can you, as a witness,
testify in this case?

102
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,848
As a witness I can testify in this case.
Everything!

103
00:17:59,883 --> 00:18:07,494
- Very well. Do you know Schukin for
a long time? - Schukin? -Yes.

104
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:13,800
- I don’t know any Schukin at all. -Oh, so?
What can you then testify in this case?

105
00:18:13,835 --> 00:18:16,581
Everything! Anything you like!

106
00:18:16,616 --> 00:18:21,953
Citizen Gorbushkin, for giving false
testimony, by the way,

107
00:18:21,988 --> 00:18:26,800
...one can get up to 3 years of imprisonment!
- Ha, up to 3? -Yes. Up to 3.

108
00:18:26,835 --> 00:18:30,185
What is this?!
This is not the highest limit...

109
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:38,901
Well, highest limit, speaking between us,
I tolerate with diffictuly. May I?

110
00:18:52,652 --> 00:19:01,055
- Here’s the goods.
- What paintbrush made it?

111
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:09,158
- What? -I am, pardon me, saying:
who painted it?

112
00:19:09,193 --> 00:19:11,271
One moment...

113
00:19:11,306 --> 00:19:16,237
Listen, buyers ask about some kind
of paintbrushes. Just fast, fast!

114
00:19:16,272 --> 00:19:19,649
What paintbrushes?
I don’t have any paintbrushes.

115
00:19:21,658 --> 00:19:24,374
Unfortunately, widow
doesn’t have paintbrushes.

116
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,875
That doesn’t matter.
We’ll make brushes ourselves.

117
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:33,925
- Sadly, painting is not signed.
- What signatures? Why are you nagging?

118
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,568
Everything is clear without signatures:
birch grove, provisions. Are you taking it?

119
00:19:38,603 --> 00:19:42,888
- Just fast!
- How much do you ask?

120
00:19:42,923 --> 00:19:49,229
- With grove, a hundred.
- Stop kidding me. Twenty. -What?

121
00:19:49,264 --> 00:19:55,824
20 for marvellous birch grove? Birch
firewood alone sums up to 40 cubic metres!

122
00:19:55,859 --> 00:20:00,771
What for should I need firewood?
We, fortunately, have got central heating.

123
00:20:00,806 --> 00:20:06,442
- How much for this one? -Well, deficiency
provisions. You know yourself how much...

124
00:20:07,477 --> 00:20:10,531
- 300.
- Stop kidding me!

125
00:20:10,532 --> 00:20:15,132
Two blue chicken and half a kilo
of cucumbers for 300 rubles?

126
00:20:15,466 --> 00:20:19,272
Well, madam, I see you don’t understand
nothing of fancy food.

127
00:20:19,307 --> 00:20:22,578
These are not ordinary chicken... Well...
This is a game!

128
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:25,479
A game?!
Aren’t your prices a game?

129
00:20:25,513 --> 00:20:29,477
- Well, are you taking it or not?
- Sit down! You know what?

130
00:20:29,512 --> 00:20:34,256
- My neighbour takes them for geese.
Is it clear? - Stop kidding me!

131
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:39,000
Aren’t you making up things?
Where have you seen such prices?

132
00:20:39,035 --> 00:20:41,297
Get out, stubborn head!

133
00:20:41,332 --> 00:20:43,559
- Careful!
- It’s nothing.

134
00:20:49,766 --> 00:20:54,358
Where to! Money! Damn!
Hand money to the widow.

135
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,885
Lyolik!

136
00:22:58,491 --> 00:23:04,305
Faster! Careful!

137
00:23:06,033 --> 00:23:11,284
- What is happening right before my eyes?
- Nothing. Swiftness is of importance here.

138
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:16,146
You know me, I don’t get panicky.

139
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:41,891
Everything must be done in blazing speed.
Everything must be sold soon.

140
00:23:41,926 --> 00:23:44,580
Let them confiscate afterwards.

141
00:23:44,581 --> 00:23:46,881
I, of course, understand,
I can put myself in your place,

142
00:23:46,915 --> 00:23:49,284
I just feel sorry for the property...

143
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:52,035
I won’t be able to sit or lie down
in my own house?

144
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:57,803
Yes, the house!
You paid 10,000 for this house.

145
00:23:57,804 --> 00:24:01,804
We must get rid of this property
right away!

146
00:24:02,338 --> 00:24:07,775
Sell at any price. Just fast!

147
00:24:11,252 --> 00:24:16,667
- I’m afraid this suit is a bit too
wide for me. -It fits fine.

148
00:24:17,803 --> 00:24:21,471
It fits just fine.

149
00:24:23,714 --> 00:24:28,241
- I feel it’s too wide.
- Where is it wide?

150
00:24:28,276 --> 00:24:32,792
It’s even, more likely, tight on you,
you can’t even breath with full heart!

151
00:24:32,827 --> 00:24:37,613
- It fits them very well!
- Well, you know, something’s not right...

152
00:24:37,648 --> 00:24:42,224
Shoulders are tight... No, it’s too tight!
I feel it’s tight.

153
00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:50,234
- You just said it was too wide! -I said wide?!
I said it was too tight. Hard to breathe!

154
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:55,397
Where is it tight?
It’s more likely wide!

155
00:24:56,121 --> 00:25:03,823
And wide! Hell knows!
By God, wide! I said wide.

156
00:25:03,858 --> 00:25:07,509
You don’t know yourself
what you want!

157
00:25:07,544 --> 00:25:12,516
- They don’t know what they want!
- Oh, well...

158
00:25:15,835 --> 00:25:22,286
- I will take the cactus as well. As a bonus.
- Take it. Just do it fast.

159
00:25:23,416 --> 00:25:28,092
- Put the chair back!
The furniture is sold. -Sorry.

160
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:34,396
This is sold, too. Don’t touch the furniture.
Everything around here is sold.

161
00:25:34,431 --> 00:25:38,934
- Just the flat is left.
- I’d take it.

162
00:25:38,969 --> 00:25:43,305
I have always been fond of your flat.

163
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:47,299
- I’d give the first paymen
right away. - Let’s go! Alright.

164
00:25:47,334 --> 00:25:51,627
Brother, what is this?!
Where will I live?

165
00:25:51,662 --> 00:25:55,533
Damn, that’s right!
Where will the widow live?

166
00:25:55,968 --> 00:26:01,305
- I can rent her a space... or a barn.
- Let’s go!

167
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,751
Stop, madmen!

168
00:26:19,626 --> 00:26:25,508
It seems like finished. Everything will be
taken away now and you can breath freely.

169
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:28,596
But what if I’m questioned?
What would I say?

170
00:26:28,631 --> 00:26:32,283
Tell them there isn’t anything.

171
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,933
Maybe I could tell them
I live with my brother?

172
00:26:35,968 --> 00:26:45,467
What? Forget about me, by God!

173
00:26:45,502 --> 00:26:50,408
What degree of relationship?
Fifth? Tenth?

174
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:56,348
Listen, sister, perhaps you should
get married? Well? Just soon.

175
00:26:56,383 --> 00:27:02,653
- How come, dear? I am kind of married.
- Then everything is fine!

176
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:08,122
No belongins,
and living with a husband!

177
00:27:08,157 --> 00:27:11,483
- Have you got any fool in mind?
- What are you saying, brother?

178
00:27:11,518 --> 00:27:13,170
Well, everything
must be done right away.

179
00:27:13,171 --> 00:27:17,271
What do you think,
would the neighbour marry you?

180
00:27:17,405 --> 00:27:20,624
What is this?

181
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:26,524
I won’t take clothes.
Don’t even speak about it!

182
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:30,747
Stop threatening, I won’t take it!

183
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:37,661
Stop whining! Tell me better why
do you visit my sister so often?

184
00:27:37,763 --> 00:27:41,699
Perhaps you compromise her?
How often that is?

185
00:27:42,434 --> 00:27:47,828
I have visited her only once a month.
And to calm down the lady!

186
00:27:47,863 --> 00:27:52,082
To calm down the lady... we know
how it is! Liar!

187
00:27:52,117 --> 00:27:58,670
He came once, he... liar!
He comes for the third time while I see!

188
00:27:58,705 --> 00:28:04,204
- Compromising! If you like her,
just say so! -Who?

189
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:09,745
- You said you liked my sister!
- When did I say I liked her?

190
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:15,013
- You said it earlier. -I was talking
about costumes. Even on the contrary,

191
00:28:15,048 --> 00:28:19,081
...I said I didn’t like.
- Stop fooling around!

192
00:28:19,116 --> 00:28:22,688
If you like her take her
to be your wife!

193
00:28:22,723 --> 00:28:26,159
Why should we marry?
I don’t understand you.

194
00:28:26,194 --> 00:28:28,995
What’s here to understand?
Just marry her!

195
00:28:29,196 --> 00:28:32,896
Sure, if they don’t want to,
what’s here to talk about?

196
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:37,392
Who doesn’t want? They do want!
They are just shy.

197
00:28:37,427 --> 00:28:41,993
I don’t want to! I don’t want you to be
tearing me in half? I have not spoken yet!

198
00:28:42,028 --> 00:28:47,978
Haven’t spoken yet? Well, say then;
"I want to get married!"
Speak up, I’m not holding you!

199
00:28:48,013 --> 00:28:53,267
- Speak up! -I don’t want to get married!
Why should I suddenly get married?

200
00:28:53,302 --> 00:28:55,446
What’s here to argue about, then?

201
00:28:55,881 --> 00:29:02,217
I don’t understand him.
She’s such an interesting woman!

202
00:29:02,252 --> 00:29:06,398
If you don’t have any taste then say so
and don’t mislead people!

203
00:29:06,433 --> 00:29:13,316
- I’m not misleading, I have got taste!
- You’ve got taste?! Stop kidding me!

204
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:17,911
Such good, interesting woman...
and what corpus she has!

205
00:29:17,946 --> 00:29:21,452
Oh well, I see you
understand nothing in women!

206
00:29:21,487 --> 00:29:25,153
No, I am competent in these,
well, women! I have got taste!

207
00:29:25,188 --> 00:29:34,483
Good, sound pace, others go like camels,
whereas this on puts feet smoothly...

208
00:29:34,659 --> 00:29:40,814
- Sure, I like her, I have got taste
- Yeah? Sister, approach him now!

209
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,176
What’s going on? I’m confused!

210
00:29:45,211 --> 00:29:51,038
What’s here to argue?
You can always get divorced.

211
00:29:51,073 --> 00:29:55,430
- If divorce, then I can get married!
- Sure, get married!

212
00:29:55,465 --> 00:30:00,795
Kiss each other! Just fast!

213
00:30:02,695 --> 00:30:08,075
Now, Nyusha, go to registry office
and divorce Gorbushkin.

214
00:30:08,076 --> 00:30:10,876
Yes, and find somebody there

215
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,723
to foist kichenware on.

216
00:30:23,797 --> 00:30:28,061
Take care of her!

217
00:30:31,224 --> 00:30:33,527
11:03AM
Near procurator's office

218
00:31:01,011 --> 00:31:06,892
I see you are?

219
00:31:16,561 --> 00:31:26,141
Well, alright, I married her,
but why did I but the suit then?

220
00:31:26,472 --> 00:31:30,741
You will wear it during your
honeymoon!

221
00:31:30,876 --> 00:31:37,779
Wait a minute! I paid for it!
Paid.

222
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,380
Yet, if I get married,
I should’ve gotten it for free!

223
00:31:42,914 --> 00:31:51,070
- It turns out I bought it from myself?
- You bought it first and married afterwards.

224
00:31:51,105 --> 00:31:57,791
Why do you keep nit-picking? -I don’t agree.
If I get married, suits belong to me anyhow.

225
00:31:57,826 --> 00:32:01,415
Give my money back
or I won’t get married!

226
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:07,709
Return his money... bite it!

227
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:11,655
Sister may have divorced already.

228
00:32:11,956 --> 00:32:17,956
Maybe she’s a woman,
maybe her ego is wounded?

229
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:24,426
- And he won’t get married!
- I also gave downpayment for the apartment!

230
00:32:24,461 --> 00:32:28,499
Yeah, I... you... according to law...

231
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:35,900
I'll crush you... grind to dust...
I... divorce!

232
00:32:39,234 --> 00:32:44,803
Why do you flare up?
Well, I will return you half.

233
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:48,798
- But I...
- That’s all!

234
00:32:50,905 --> 00:32:59,711
Don’t touch my furniture! Don’t touch it!
Look, they’re wreching my furniture!

235
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:03,703
- Why did you sell it? -Why did you waste
time? If you had married earlier,

236
00:33:03,738 --> 00:33:08,306
...you’d get the furniture! -How,
you told me just now to get married.

237
00:33:08,341 --> 00:33:12,635
And couldn’t you think of it yourself?

238
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:16,442
Now take responsibility!

239
00:33:29,691 --> 00:33:35,647
- Got divorced? Just fast!
- I got divorced, for God’s sake.

240
00:33:35,682 --> 00:33:41,757
- And I sold kitchenware to neighbours.
- Why do you sell my kitchenware?

241
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:44,581
From what will I eat?

242
00:33:45,584 --> 00:33:48,328
What scrimpy groom you have!

243
00:33:48,329 --> 00:33:51,629
We made such great deal
but he is still dissatisfied!

244
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:56,412
- Howling like a owl...
- Why should we be satisfied?

245
00:33:56,447 --> 00:34:02,864
- Exactly, let him better give our money back!
- Alright, shut up, bastard!

246
00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:07,576
I said I’d return... half... later.

247
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:15,569
- My head is dizzy. -Why did you get
married? You shouldn’t have gotten married.

248
00:34:15,604 --> 00:34:20,823
And head wouldn’t hurt. "Beer doesn’t
ruin people, water ruins people..."

249
00:34:22,486 --> 00:34:24,944
11:59AM
Hare crossroads

250
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:06,983
What’s this?

251
00:35:17,447 --> 00:35:21,913
Come closer to bride.
Standing like some fool!

252
00:35:21,948 --> 00:35:27,113
Why are you yelling at him?
You’ve frightened my groom!

253
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:33,452
What’s this?

254
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:39,648
What's going on in my room!

255
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:47,360
Whether it ended for good
or for bad we do not know.

256
00:35:47,361 --> 00:35:50,761
But Gorbushkin was put behind bars
only after a week...

257
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,663
Concerning family front, life, dear folks,
is so complicated affair

258
00:36:12,976 --> 00:36:16,024
that there is nothing
it wouldn’t encompass...

259
00:36:17,317 --> 00:36:19,740
WEIRD AFFAIR

260
00:36:22,662 --> 00:36:29,458
I just don’t get it in my head
why must you work on a holiday?!

261
00:36:29,493 --> 00:36:36,228
Understand me, Zinulyenka, we’re launching
new object, it’s end of the quarter.

262
00:36:36,263 --> 00:36:41,670
But you’re overworking yourself!

263
00:36:41,705 --> 00:36:47,393
Oh, Zinaida,
we’re all working in self-denial.

264
00:36:50,277 --> 00:36:52,734
Thanks, honey!

265
00:36:58,048 --> 00:36:59,914
Will you at least be home for dinner?

266
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:06,889
Why, Zinulya,
I won’t be home until supper.

267
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:10,416
Koka, take care of yourself!

268
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:55,872
- Toly, breakfast is getting cold!
- I’m coming.

269
00:38:37,759 --> 00:38:42,389
- Mom, I’ve finished.
- Good boy!

270
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:56,214
Barygin-Amurskiy speaking...
Hallo...

271
00:38:59,882 --> 00:39:05,468
Hallo, it’s me,
I have a surprise for you...

272
00:39:06,373 --> 00:39:10,969
Yegor Ivanovich?
Hello, dear, hello.

273
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:15,470
What Yegor Ivanovich?
Don’t you recognize me? It's me...

274
00:39:16,804 --> 00:39:21,159
- Yes, I’m listening, Yegor Ivanovich...
- Dad, I’ve finished eating!

275
00:39:21,194 --> 00:39:26,559
What do you want?
Speak, just fast, otherwise...

276
00:39:27,447 --> 00:39:32,453
- Breakfast is getting cold. -You’re
not free to speak? -Yes, yes.

277
00:39:32,488 --> 00:39:39,096
Yes... the show?
Show was great yesterday.

278
00:39:39,509 --> 00:39:46,802
Mine is away until evening.
We can meet!

279
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:56,593
- What, working on a holiday!
I’ve fed up with this! -Fed up?

280
00:39:56,628 --> 00:40:02,099
Well, I don’t insist.
We can go on without meeting.

281
00:40:02,134 --> 00:40:05,728
No, no, no, Yegor Ivanovich.

282
00:40:05,763 --> 00:40:14,205
I am not refusing, on the contrary...
But I will be filing complaints!

283
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,680
- Rehearsal on a holiday!
- Oh Lord...

284
00:40:18,715 --> 00:40:25,330
You’re a great conspirator!
So today we don’t need to skulk,

285
00:40:25,365 --> 00:40:31,782
rather we can finally meet
in normal, intimate atmosphere.

286
00:40:31,817 --> 00:40:35,169
Go straight to my place... and...

287
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:40,970
and you can finish
sewing my dress right here.

288
00:40:41,204 --> 00:40:45,937
- What dress? -By the way, Kapochka,
regards from my beloved!

289
00:40:45,972 --> 00:40:50,950
- Why did you return?
- Forgot.

290
00:40:58,131 --> 00:41:04,616
Imagine,
my came back for his suitcase!

291
00:41:04,651 --> 00:41:08,863
So, I’m waiting.

292
00:41:09,013 --> 00:41:14,819
Can you imagine,
rehearsal on a holiday! Trying on!

293
00:41:14,854 --> 00:41:24,456
- Anatoly, you’re simply overworking yourself!
- We all are working in self-denial!

294
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:34,536
- Will you be home at least for dinner?
- Why, Tanyusha, don’t wait me before supper!

295
00:41:40,217 --> 00:41:45,860
<i>And in heat and any frost
somewhere around here Cupid walks</i>

296
00:41:45,895 --> 00:41:51,406
<i>with sheathful of arrows
little Cupid walks.</i>

297
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:56,918
<i>He know business well,
He has got sharp arrows,</i>

298
00:41:56,953 --> 00:42:02,097
<i>And arrows pierce us from all sides.</i>

299
00:42:02,132 --> 00:42:13,973
<i>He amuses himself with people,
and we suffer from love.</i>

300
00:42:14,008 --> 00:42:22,672
<i>And he laughs and snickers,
this wicked joker Cupid.</i>

301
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:31,336
<i>Maybe at day, maybe at night
he will release his arrow,</i>

302
00:42:31,371 --> 00:42:36,861
<i>And he knows whom
will I fall in love with.</i>

303
00:42:36,896 --> 00:42:42,835
<i>He knows business well,
He has got sharp arrows,</i>

304
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:48,625
<i>And arrows pierce us from all sides.</i>

305
00:42:50,589 --> 00:43:01,661
<i>He amuses himself with people,
and we suffer from love.</i>

306
00:43:01,696 --> 00:43:12,734
<i>And he laughs and snickers,
this wicked joker Cupid.</i>

307
00:43:26,831 --> 00:43:40,620
<i>And he laughs and snickers,
this wicked joker Cupid.</i>

308
00:43:40,873 --> 00:43:45,663
- Where?
- That’s all, pretty face, I sold them.

309
00:43:46,584 --> 00:43:51,192
Oh, you... Ah!

310
00:43:59,256 --> 00:44:03,283
- Anatoly!
- Couldn’t he come back?

311
00:44:03,318 --> 00:44:06,735
That’s impossible!

312
00:44:16,658 --> 00:44:22,187
<i>He entertains himself with people...</i>

313
00:44:22,222 --> 00:44:27,805
<i>And we sufffer from love...</i>

314
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:38,751
<i>And he laughs and snickers,
this wicked joker Cupid.</i>

315
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:46,177
Honey... At last we’re alone
for the first time!

316
00:44:46,212 --> 00:44:50,363
Darling, I’ve waited this for so long!

317
00:45:00,275 --> 00:45:03,529
Clock!

318
00:45:10,867 --> 00:45:13,939
Anatoly!

319
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:38,819
Lord, that’s neighbour behind
the wall coughing. He’s got flu.

320
00:46:00,863 --> 00:46:03,149
What’s up with you?

321
00:46:03,184 --> 00:46:10,056
- Do you hear?
- I don’t hear anything.

322
00:46:10,091 --> 00:46:13,351
Resound...

323
00:46:13,386 --> 00:46:16,612
Boots!

324
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:37,255
I can not! I can not! I can not
work in such nervy conditions!

325
00:46:38,178 --> 00:46:40,180
Anatoly!

326
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:48,116
Anatoly!

327
00:46:48,151 --> 00:46:52,772
Anatoly, I understand.
You’re an artist.

328
00:46:52,773 --> 00:46:56,173
You’re a man with morbid,
artistic imagination!

329
00:46:56,207 --> 00:46:59,688
Exactly! But you will feel totally
secure at Sofochka’s!

330
00:46:59,723 --> 00:47:03,784
- I don’t know if it’s convenient.
- What nonsense! Sofockha’s my best friend

331
00:47:03,819 --> 00:47:07,698
and we have no secrets from
each other. Let’s go!

332
00:47:15,155 --> 00:47:18,443
- Come on in!
- Well...

333
00:47:19,096 --> 00:47:25,137
- Oh, pardon!
- Of you, fish-eye!

334
00:47:27,328 --> 00:47:28,441
Stop!

335
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:04,411
- We’re in luck because Sofocka isn’t
even home! -Very well!

336
00:48:10,601 --> 00:48:14,879
- Who’s this?
- This is Sofocka, she’s from ballet

337
00:48:14,914 --> 00:48:18,440
and, by the way,
she isn’t uneducated.

338
00:48:18,475 --> 00:48:21,849
And this is her husband.
Late husband.

339
00:48:21,884 --> 00:48:28,869
- Honey, finally we’re alone...
- How much I waited for this!

340
00:48:30,596 --> 00:48:33,793
Quiet!

341
00:48:46,299 --> 00:48:52,340
- It is the husband!
- Late husband? -I wish!

342
00:48:52,375 --> 00:48:54,246
It’s my husband!

343
00:48:54,281 --> 00:48:58,517
He probably saw us on the street
and followed us!

344
00:48:58,552 --> 00:49:06,721
If he gets in here, he’ll kill us!
You, in any case. I know him!

345
00:49:06,756 --> 00:49:10,139
No... no, no!

346
00:49:12,004 --> 00:49:14,495
Quiet!

347
00:49:22,633 --> 00:49:26,697
Sonechka honey! I got free earlier
and came to visit you but to no avail.

348
00:49:27,055 --> 00:49:30,426
I will come by in an hour. Kisses.
Your Nikolay.

349
00:49:50,536 --> 00:49:53,596
What does this mean,
what do you think?

350
00:49:53,597 --> 00:49:57,397
I think your husband
amuses himself with your friend

351
00:49:57,431 --> 00:50:00,913
and has come here for no other reason
than to take rest from family life.

352
00:50:00,948 --> 00:50:06,606
How ungrateful!
Koka! Just wait!

353
00:50:06,641 --> 00:50:07,765
Calm down!

354
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:16,636
Ah, Sofochka!

355
00:50:20,313 --> 00:50:24,189
Did anybody come while
I wasn’t here?

356
00:50:24,224 --> 00:50:29,093
- Hello. -I’m asking if anybody
came while I wasn’t here?

357
00:50:29,128 --> 00:50:33,331
- Anybody!
- What’s up?

358
00:50:36,387 --> 00:50:41,335
Well, if you know everything,
I’m asking you to leave at once.

359
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:46,284
- Somebody is about to pay me a visit.
- What do you mean by somebody?

360
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,826
- My husband will visit you now!
- Well, I must be going...

361
00:50:48,861 --> 00:50:53,662
To leave at such moment... I want to see
how this bastard will step

362
00:50:53,697 --> 00:50:57,298
...over threshold of this...
- Pardon me, I think unwanted here.

363
00:50:57,333 --> 00:51:02,248
No, no, do stay! Let the husband come
and see moral portrait of his wife!

364
00:51:02,283 --> 00:51:06,059
- Farewell, Anatoly!
- Goodbye, goodbye!

365
00:51:10,235 --> 00:51:14,513
Dear Sonya... it’s me.

366
00:51:17,706 --> 00:51:22,336
Sonya! Sonyechka!

367
00:51:24,968 --> 00:51:30,622
- This door leads to neighbour’s room.
Go in there. -But... -Warm greatings.

368
00:52:13,491 --> 00:52:19,434
What is this?
A lady is about to pay me a visit!

369
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:25,214
But there’s some ugly mug
residing in my room!

370
00:52:25,249 --> 00:52:32,758
Pardon... I’m leaving this very minute.
I just laid down for a second to rest.

371
00:52:32,793 --> 00:52:36,076
- I didn’t know it was your bed.
- This is nonsense!

372
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:45,656
He, look, puts his feet in my bed! Maybe I
don’t allow my acquaintances to put feet in bed!

373
00:52:50,063 --> 00:52:56,002
Oh, here you are, fish-eye!

374
00:53:03,585 --> 00:53:11,412
Be thankful that lady is visiting me,
otherwise I would have punched you good!

375
00:53:11,766 --> 00:53:14,860
Come inside, one moment...
What?

376
00:53:22,128 --> 00:53:27,177
What does this mean?
How should I interpret it?

377
00:53:27,212 --> 00:53:32,086
- I demand explanations!
- Stop this hysterics!

378
00:53:32,121 --> 00:53:39,209
I'm free. I have a right to visit my
co-worker on my holiday... To have some tea.

379
00:53:39,244 --> 00:53:44,018
- And this is having some tea?
- Just tea.

380
00:53:44,053 --> 00:53:50,470
- Do you think I’m and idiot?
- Oh you, fish-eye!

381
00:53:53,614 --> 00:53:56,219
Don’t touch my face!

382
00:54:01,515 --> 00:54:04,996
Let it go! Help!

383
00:54:16,447 --> 00:54:19,574
Well, now when we know everything,

384
00:54:19,575 --> 00:54:23,675
Let’s settle it like civilized people:
quietly and without scenes.

385
00:54:23,809 --> 00:54:31,934
I propose the following:
I marry Nikolay,

386
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:40,161
Artist marries you, Zinochka, and these
two co-workers would make

387
00:54:40,196 --> 00:54:44,316
a wonderful couple, too.
This is what we should do.

388
00:54:44,351 --> 00:54:49,948
Hello... I think she has bunch of kids.
I won’t be marrying her!

389
00:54:49,983 --> 00:54:58,699
Found some simpleton!
I ask you not to offend my wife,

390
00:54:58,734 --> 00:55:02,697
moreover, I don’t intend to let
any bypasser marry her!

391
00:55:02,698 --> 00:55:04,998
Phew, I wouldn’t have moved in with him.

392
00:55:05,332 --> 00:55:12,576
Look, what a room he has!
Can I live here with my kids?

393
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:17,902
I wouldn’t let you and the kids
to come near this room!

394
00:55:17,937 --> 00:55:22,078
She has such bastard-for-a-husband
and still wants to get my room!

395
00:55:22,113 --> 00:55:27,460
I see one lying in my bed already...
getting used to it.

396
00:55:53,900 --> 00:56:00,817
Gentlemen, in that case I take Nikolay
to be my husband, artist and his wife

397
00:56:00,852 --> 00:56:06,031
stays as it is, but Zinochka takes
this fool to be her husband.

398
00:56:06,066 --> 00:56:11,737
As if! I will marry her now!
Keep your pockets open!

399
00:56:11,772 --> 00:56:15,358
I see this shabby person
for a first time!

400
00:56:16,905 --> 00:56:23,611
- And perhaps she’s a pickpocket.
- I ask you not to offend our ladies!

401
00:56:24,246 --> 00:56:27,904
- I consider this to be right decision.
- No way,

402
00:56:27,905 --> 00:56:31,005
...I don’t want to move away
from my apartment!

403
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:36,870
We have our own room and a bath.
I don’t want to meddle in communal flats.

404
00:56:59,459 --> 00:57:03,799
Because of three stooges all the couples
are falling apart! It was so good,

405
00:57:03,834 --> 00:57:08,512
I’d married Nikolay, this one him,
and they together.

406
00:57:23,125 --> 00:57:26,821
Such are particular problems which particular
families face in particular areas of family front.

407
00:57:29,567 --> 00:57:35,191
So, let's sweep with iron broom of satire
all that there is to sweep in particular cases.

408
00:57:51,643 --> 00:57:56,300
Marriage, friends, is a serious business. To marry
is not the same than to go to a bath-house.

409
00:57:57,338 --> 00:58:01,391
And Volodyka Zavitushkin, for sure,
took a little haste with his marriage.

410
00:58:02,124 --> 00:58:04,789
EVENT AT A WEDDING

411
01:00:49,566 --> 01:00:54,463
- Newlyweds are not here yet.
- Let them not show up at all!

412
01:00:54,498 --> 01:00:58,150
Three days
they know each other and...

413
01:00:58,451 --> 01:01:04,151
...husband and wife!
Congratulations! Hurray! Bis!

414
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:08,696
- We’re?
- What?

415
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:14,466
Here’s my word of a parent.

416
01:01:14,501 --> 01:01:24,447
- I am against such rash... marriage!
- What are you doing?

417
01:01:24,482 --> 01:01:31,165
- You drink vodka without waiting for
the guests! -Maybe I drink it for balance?

418
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:37,848
It may be such marriaged do not satisfy me.
Three days they know each other...

419
01:01:37,883 --> 01:01:41,823
- Not three.
- How much then? -Four.

420
01:01:45,356 --> 01:01:49,042
You’re drunk!
Your nose is blue!

421
01:01:49,077 --> 01:01:57,974
But yours is light blue! Stop, don’t touch it!
Don’t touch my self-confidence!

422
01:01:58,009 --> 01:02:02,785
Lo, arrived!

423
01:02:03,209 --> 01:02:08,556
- Is the dress ready?
- Where’s your groom?

424
01:02:08,557 --> 01:02:12,587
He’s at hairdressers.
He’ll be here soon.

425
01:02:12,622 --> 01:02:24,705
Very good, very modern marriage. Bride
comes alone and groom sits at hairdresser’s...

426
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:35,641
He couldn’t do it earlier. That’s all correct,
but I’d prepare a month before!

427
01:02:35,676 --> 01:02:39,800
To sacrament of marriage!

428
01:02:39,835 --> 01:02:46,661
I would, perhaps, go half a year before
to hairdressers, to bathhouse...

429
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:51,910
- Drunk already! Congratulations!
- Congratulations...

430
01:02:53,638 --> 01:02:58,371
- Guests!
- The dress!

431
01:03:00,929 --> 01:03:07,182
Rude century! Rude morals!
There’s no romance!

432
01:03:07,217 --> 01:03:13,435
No chance for a man to lead
peaceful life.

433
01:03:21,101 --> 01:03:26,266
Well, I sit in a tram and see a lady
in front of me showing herself off. Nice lady.

434
01:03:26,301 --> 01:03:31,545
Neat, winter coat, hat...
I looked at her and was stunned. Lord!

435
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:34,590
I wonder;
what ladies go on trams!

436
01:03:34,625 --> 01:03:39,210
She stands in front of me, one hand by
the bar. In order not to fall down.

437
01:03:39,245 --> 01:03:44,214
- I tell her, come, sit on my knee.
- That’s logical.

438
01:03:44,249 --> 01:03:49,125
No, she says, merci.
I see it’s a hard case.

439
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:52,977
Then I... wait, that's here.

440
01:03:59,299 --> 01:04:01,699
Run, Seryoga!

441
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:12,008
No, not here, there was no dog here. Mommy
was, daddy was, but no dog here. Let’s go.

442
01:04:12,581 --> 01:04:18,580
I see this lady going to exit, she’s approacing exit,
I follow her. There we got acquainted

443
01:04:18,615 --> 01:04:24,580
and began seeing each other. We seeing one day,
two days, and yesterday I made her a proposal.

444
01:04:24,615 --> 01:04:28,667
- Did she accept it at once? -No, not at once,
we settled the papers only today.

445
01:04:28,702 --> 01:04:34,650
Here. That’s right!
Right here, I remember.

446
01:04:34,685 --> 01:04:39,067
There were stairs. Here at last.

447
01:04:47,987 --> 01:04:50,353
Is the wedding here?

448
01:04:52,778 --> 01:04:56,355
No, not here. Exactly! Let’s go.

449
01:04:56,390 --> 01:05:01,407
Please, put the coats here.
Come on through.

450
01:05:01,442 --> 01:05:04,687
Come on in the rooms.

451
01:05:04,722 --> 01:05:09,948
- Dasha. Dasha!
- I’m coming.

452
01:05:09,983 --> 01:05:20,109
- Oh dear! We’re very glad. -Accept
our congratulations. -Thank you.

453
01:05:20,144 --> 01:05:25,744
- It’s all so unexpected... all so fast.
- Oh, don’t speak.

454
01:05:27,415 --> 01:05:31,237
Ivan Israilevich!

455
01:06:06,037 --> 01:06:11,441
Maybe here?
No, no. Maybe here?

456
01:06:19,479 --> 01:06:23,873
- Is groom supposed to be here?
- God, that’s the new husband!

457
01:06:23,874 --> 01:06:25,874
Sorry,
I didn’t recognize you right away.

458
01:06:25,908 --> 01:06:33,114
- Oh no, they’re the groom, I’m just their pal.
- Yes, I am the groom... Me!

459
01:06:35,341 --> 01:06:40,904
Take care of the groom, take him to
the guests, have some conversation.

460
01:06:48,543 --> 01:06:50,920
Let’s go.

461
01:06:59,055 --> 01:07:02,400
My pleasure.

462
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:06,575
Sergey Ivanovich.

463
01:07:24,257 --> 01:07:30,947
- Would you care for a sip? Little one?
- Merci. -It never does bad.

464
01:07:30,982 --> 01:07:36,077
Here you go.

465
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:41,690
- You’ll always have time to meet
the guests. -That’s logical!

466
01:07:49,261 --> 01:07:56,258
Yes, gentlemen, there are no romance,
nobody allows to have a peaceful drink.

467
01:07:56,572 --> 01:08:00,281
There’s no previous beauty.

468
01:08:01,793 --> 01:08:07,834
Yes, earlier I would have bride
wallowing beside my feet!

469
01:08:07,869 --> 01:08:14,623
And earlier the groom...
would be ground to dust!

470
01:08:15,065 --> 01:08:19,702
I don’t agree to be ground to dust!
By the way, where’s my young wife?

471
01:08:19,737 --> 01:08:25,016
Don’t give a damn about her! Bride is
no wolf, it won’t run off to the woods.

472
01:09:42,570 --> 01:09:44,947
Pardon, comrade!

473
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:52,162
I am astonished.
You very much to drink!

474
01:09:52,197 --> 01:09:57,614
Earlier I could freely have
one fourth...

475
01:09:57,632 --> 01:10:02,251
Sure, then there was romance,
snacks!

476
01:10:05,703 --> 01:10:07,933
- Let me kiss you.
- Oh, well!

477
01:10:07,968 --> 01:10:11,888
No, I really like you!

478
01:10:13,845 --> 01:10:21,832
Vova, don’t marry in haste
the next time.

479
01:10:22,227 --> 01:10:30,612
Well, if you, fool, got married,
let everything be as before, neat and nice.

480
01:10:30,647 --> 01:10:33,504
Don’t nerve me, mom!

481
01:10:33,539 --> 01:10:39,068
Husband will see me without a dress for
the first time, but I am as if canary bird!

482
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:44,369
The dress is very wonderful!
Very wonderful!

483
01:10:44,404 --> 01:10:49,635
But such darn catskins
were worn in tsar times.

484
01:10:51,042 --> 01:10:55,001
Then put my kerchief on top.

485
01:10:56,863 --> 01:11:02,090
- Well?
- Now it’s completely wonderful!

486
01:11:05,025 --> 01:11:10,646
- Now there’s no dress to see!
- Oh, Lord... -Exactly!

487
01:11:10,681 --> 01:11:13,713
I inquire where’s my young wife?

488
01:11:13,748 --> 01:11:20,108
- There she is, among guests.
- Yes? -Yes, yes.

489
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:33,761
Please, "Black Horseshoes"!

490
01:11:47,802 --> 01:11:53,565
<i>In night guitar fell out of my hands,</i>

491
01:11:56,466 --> 01:12:04,466
<i>wind suddenly blew
and there was not enough love,</i>

492
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:13,635
<i>There’s just lonely darkenss in bushes</i>

493
01:12:13,636 --> 01:12:20,836
<i>wintery road is empty like soul.</i>

494
01:12:22,370 --> 01:12:35,359
<i>There are just black horseshoes
in snow.</i>

495
01:12:36,594 --> 01:12:48,902
<i>Yet they will never bring
anybody luck.</i>

496
01:12:50,237 --> 01:12:59,656
<i>You are like dream, song over snow,
demons have forbidden you to know horses.</i>

497
01:12:59,691 --> 01:13:04,175
<i>You’re gone forever,
but why there is white snow,</i>

498
01:13:04,176 --> 01:13:07,976
<i>black horseshoes in a dream?</i>

499
01:13:09,110 --> 01:13:22,292
<i>There are just black horseshoes
in snow.</i>

500
01:13:25,727 --> 01:13:35,474
<i>Yet they will never bring anybody luck!</i>

501
01:13:49,083 --> 01:13:58,974
<i>There are just black horseshoes
in snow,</i>

502
01:14:02,309 --> 01:14:12,066
<i>yet they will never bring
anybody luck!</i>

503
01:14:17,905 --> 01:14:21,072
What are you doing?

504
01:14:21,107 --> 01:14:25,339
- I’m really panicky!
- Go on, I’ll be right there. Come on.

505
01:14:27,368 --> 01:14:34,764
- I don’t recognize my young bride.
- How come? What's up with you?

506
01:14:34,799 --> 01:14:42,103
Hell knows! You know, Seryega, I've never
seen her without a coat and a hat.

507
01:14:42,138 --> 01:14:45,697
But there’s so many women...
you get sure!

508
01:14:45,732 --> 01:14:49,137
Wait, you don’t recognize
your bride, do you?

509
01:14:49,172 --> 01:14:55,031
- Darn! -No, I can recognize her
but only with a coat on.

510
01:14:59,183 --> 01:15:01,765
It’s the first time something like this
happens with me!

511
01:15:06,445 --> 01:15:11,599
Ask daddy
to show what is the bride like.

512
01:15:12,956 --> 01:15:19,082
It’s not easy for me to ask such...
intimate details.

513
01:15:19,117 --> 01:15:25,208
- That’s logical!
- Seryoga, you ask him discreetly.

514
01:15:25,948 --> 01:15:28,563
It looks like he can still talk...

515
01:15:32,998 --> 01:15:39,379
Daddy! There is the groom...

516
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:44,034
- I am the groom. -He wants to know
where his young bride is.

517
01:15:44,069 --> 01:15:46,911
He’s ceased recognizing her in light.

518
01:15:49,283 --> 01:15:53,435
Dad, can you talk?

519
01:15:53,884 --> 01:16:01,416
In that case, be so kind and tell him where
their bride is. He's very interested to know.

520
01:16:04,955 --> 01:16:13,454
It’s offensive for me, as a father,
to hear that.

521
01:16:17,246 --> 01:16:22,138
I told you, Volodyka,
don’t get married so soon!

522
01:16:22,173 --> 01:16:26,884
You see, you can’t even recognize
your wife!

523
01:16:26,919 --> 01:16:32,574
Well, they can recognize her, but
only together with her coat.

524
01:16:32,609 --> 01:16:38,230
Daddy, we always met on street, so,
naturally, now I have a right

525
01:16:38,265 --> 01:16:40,796
to be perplexed without a coat
and a hat?

526
01:16:45,292 --> 01:16:51,310
- Here she goes...
- Oh, that’s... -Quiet!

527
01:16:52,433 --> 01:16:59,123
- Look, there’s some dog
after her... -Really? -Sure.

528
01:17:08,325 --> 01:17:11,078
I was looking for you everywhere!

529
01:17:12,006 --> 01:17:14,782
You look very interesting
in this dress.

530
01:17:14,817 --> 01:17:18,373
It fits you so well without a hat,
as if you had different face!

531
01:17:18,408 --> 01:17:23,357
- And now I’m not quite myself because of you!
- What are you allowing yourself!

532
01:17:23,392 --> 01:17:26,215
Only now, in full electric light

533
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:31,404
I see how beautiful you are!
I’m on fire!

534
01:17:32,101 --> 01:17:36,628
What is this?!
Easier with your rakers!

535
01:17:36,663 --> 01:17:41,028
Who are you?
Don't raise your voice!

536
01:17:41,063 --> 01:17:44,726
Who are those persons walking around,
not allowing to hug?!

537
01:17:44,761 --> 01:17:48,479
- Well, you know...
- Go to..

538
01:17:57,706 --> 01:18:00,550
You cad!

539
01:18:02,467 --> 01:18:09,031
- Well, three days!
- This is insolence, to hug my wife!

540
01:18:09,066 --> 01:18:12,619
I don’t even allow it myself!

541
01:18:15,129 --> 01:18:19,042
What now?
Daddy's just kidding you.

542
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:26,419
- Well, daddy, merci!
- To your health!

543
01:18:26,942 --> 01:18:33,188
- Don’t look, come on. -I’m so sorry
it’s not her. I liked this one a lot!

544
01:18:36,453 --> 01:18:40,810
- Now I will get some shit and
have to live with it. -Logical!

545
01:18:42,274 --> 01:18:48,998
Volodya, that’s her mommy.
Go and ask her where your bride is.

546
01:18:50,895 --> 01:18:56,709
- Is this mommy? I think she’s not.
- Sure, she’s mommy. I can tell it by her kerchief.

547
01:18:59,236 --> 01:19:05,277
- No, she’s somewhat young.
- Yeah, young, well groomed!

548
01:19:05,312 --> 01:19:09,834
She’s become young.
That’s her for sure.

549
01:19:09,869 --> 01:19:16,465
- Allow me... -Why are you going
out without seeing guests?

550
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:21,517
Oh, I came out where it’s quieter,
I think I will sit here for a while...

551
01:19:21,552 --> 01:19:25,977
Talk different subjects with mommy.
Having much cares, mommy?

552
01:19:26,012 --> 01:19:30,403
Allow me to call you mommy now.
To the beginning of kinship.

553
01:19:30,438 --> 01:19:34,397
No, "mommy" is not good.
Better call me "kitty"!

554
01:19:34,944 --> 01:19:41,668
Kitty? How come, mommy?
I don’t dare to call you kitty.

555
01:19:41,703 --> 01:19:46,072
I respect you,
but it’s hard to call you kitty.

556
01:19:46,107 --> 01:19:50,350
Well, then call me siskin,
like I was called in childhood.

557
01:19:52,738 --> 01:20:01,316
How come "siskin"? You’ve overtroubled
yourself, mommy. Tired, pies, heat!

558
01:20:01,351 --> 01:20:06,777
- Sure, naturally!
- Oh, I want you to call me

559
01:20:06,812 --> 01:20:12,016
In some gentle name, like kitty, siskin.

560
01:20:12,051 --> 01:20:19,526
- Goldfish!
- Mommy! I can’t call you so, in your age...

561
01:20:19,561 --> 01:20:22,968
What goldfish you are?!
Oh, goldfish!

562
01:20:23,003 --> 01:20:27,781
Vladimir, I don’t understand you.
I don’t hide my age.

563
01:20:27,816 --> 01:20:33,381
You’re behaving strange!
Come on, kiss me!

564
01:20:33,416 --> 01:20:39,292
Mommy, I wanted to ask you one thing.
You know, I am very forgetful of people,

565
01:20:39,327 --> 01:20:46,597
un childhood I had night-blindness, my vision
is bad at evenings. I almost don’t see you.

566
01:20:46,632 --> 01:20:50,414
Mommy, where are you?

567
01:20:50,449 --> 01:20:56,185
Mommy, where are you?
Mommy...

568
01:20:56,220 --> 01:21:01,601
- In short, I wanted to ask you where’s
your daughter? -Daughter?

569
01:21:02,121 --> 01:21:06,467
- How do you know? -Pardon, mommy,
I don’t quite understand you.

570
01:21:06,502 --> 01:21:11,169
- I’m asking where your daughter is?
- She’s not here.

571
01:21:11,204 --> 01:21:18,394
Oh, I’m wandering like a fool through rooms
and I see where she is not. But where she is?

572
01:21:18,429 --> 01:21:22,341
- She’s out on country.
- Who’s out on country? -She is.

573
01:21:22,376 --> 01:21:29,822
No, mommy, I’m askig where’s daughter,
where’s your daughter? Where is the daughter?

574
01:21:29,857 --> 01:21:38,561
Vladimir, I didn’t want to upset you, but,
since you know everything, she’s out on country.

575
01:21:39,418 --> 01:21:46,256
- She won’t cost you a thing.
- How "out on country"? Whom did I just...

576
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:55,258
Excuse me, I don’t understand.
I’m asking where’s the daughter?
Not the other one, but this one?

577
01:21:55,293 --> 01:22:00,497
- What other one? I don’t have
second daughter. -Oh, hell!

578
01:22:00,532 --> 01:22:08,918
Yes, I was really in a situation, but
then circumstances turned...

579
01:22:08,953 --> 01:22:16,629
- So, anyway, you must understand me, when...
- Mommy, you’re scaring me. I am not talking

580
01:22:16,664 --> 01:22:22,022
about the one who is out on country
and not about the one who was not,
but about the one there.

581
01:22:22,057 --> 01:22:25,378
- No, she was never there.
- Lord!

582
01:22:25,413 --> 01:22:31,340
Oh, there?
No, that was a boy, a son!

583
01:22:34,885 --> 01:22:41,085
- Son? -He’s at granny’s now.
Boy will also cost you nothing.

584
01:22:42,676 --> 01:22:45,509
Boy!...

585
01:22:56,338 --> 01:23:02,324
Mommy! Kitty. Siskin. Goldfish!

586
01:23:02,359 --> 01:23:07,345
- Calm down. -Don’t be jealous.
Forget it.

587
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:10,348
I’ve already forgotten.
Mommy, where is the daughter.

588
01:23:10,349 --> 01:23:14,549
What is she like?
Show me her, that’s all.

589
01:23:14,583 --> 01:23:20,251
- Go on to your business, lie down, take a rest.
- Well, if you insist, I can

590
01:23:20,286 --> 01:23:25,626
..show her picture. -No, why her picture.
Show her to me in person.

591
01:23:25,661 --> 01:23:31,966
...in full stature. -No, she’s very small,
nice and turned yellow.

592
01:23:32,255 --> 01:23:37,306
- What? Is daughter sick?
- No, daughter is alright!

593
01:23:37,341 --> 01:23:42,077
Well, I am gonna show you now.

594
01:23:48,259 --> 01:23:52,335
- Well, found out?
- Mommy is not well!

595
01:23:52,370 --> 01:23:56,397
- Go on, I will be there right away.
- I don’t understand why
is she held among healthy people.

596
01:23:56,432 --> 01:24:00,317
Without warning. She can stab somebody
whith a fork at the table!

597
01:24:00,352 --> 01:24:01,952
And I didn’t find out about the bride...

598
01:24:01,953 --> 01:24:05,853
Don’t worry. They will sort out at the
table whom to sit beside groom.

599
01:24:05,887 --> 01:24:09,665
If only I could manage it to the table!
I don’t like scandals!

600
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:13,243
Don’t give a damn about them.
In worst case we can just go away.

601
01:24:31,277 --> 01:24:35,416
- Where is the young wife?
- How long can it be?

602
01:24:35,451 --> 01:24:39,424
Mommy said
she would bring her right away.

603
01:24:39,459 --> 01:24:43,839
She’s gotten somewhat yellowish or what.
Probably, powdering her nose.

604
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:51,798
Imagine what bastards!
He’s barely had time to arrive here, but
he’s already been told about my children!

605
01:24:51,833 --> 01:24:56,887
- About all of them? -Let’s assume that not
about all of them, nevertheless that’s no fun.

606
01:24:56,922 --> 01:25:00,685
?
There she is.

607
01:25:01,733 --> 01:25:09,663
- Please, everybody come to table!
- Wait, Katerina is not here!

608
01:26:13,777 --> 01:26:17,486
- Oh, young wife’s here.
- Young wife!

609
01:26:19,148 --> 01:26:22,948
Excuse me!
We were waiting for you.

610
01:26:22,983 --> 01:26:26,361
Impossible!

611
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:31,277
What’s is this?
This redhaired is my bride?

612
01:26:31,312 --> 01:26:35,328
- It can’t be!
- What can’t be? If mother brought her,

613
01:26:35,363 --> 01:26:37,803
so that is it.

614
01:26:38,434 --> 01:26:45,340
- Good one.
- Vladimir, come here... there she is.

615
01:26:45,375 --> 01:26:50,901
How wonderful!
That’s deceit, fraud!

616
01:26:50,936 --> 01:26:54,480
Mine was more interesting.
What are you foisting upon me?

617
01:26:54,615 --> 01:26:56,851
- Calm down, calm down!
- This is not the one!

618
01:26:57,165 --> 01:27:02,258
Don’t make scenes, young man! It’s shameful
to kick up a row for small matters!

619
01:27:02,293 --> 01:27:07,332
What small matters?
This is a fraud!

620
01:27:07,367 --> 01:27:14,057
- I haven’t had so much drink not to notice!
- For God’s sake, stop shouting! -Mommy...

621
01:27:14,092 --> 01:27:18,243
- It’s bitter...
- Bitter? Bitter!

622
01:27:18,278 --> 01:27:26,307
Bitter, bitter, bitter!

623
01:27:29,901 --> 01:27:34,338
- I really don’t know what to do.
- Come on!

624
01:27:36,832 --> 01:27:39,418
Vladimir!

625
01:27:39,453 --> 01:27:45,471
- He’s crazy! -Look, comrades, how he
harasses everybody! -Shoud’ve drunk less!

626
01:27:45,506 --> 01:27:49,612
- Indulges in other woman while wife
is around! -Vampire! Sexual maniac!

627
01:27:49,647 --> 01:27:53,462
I don’t like scandals.
We’ll talk later.

628
01:27:53,497 --> 01:27:57,740
- Vladimir...
- Go away, mommy. I’ve no time for you!

629
01:27:57,775 --> 01:28:01,154
Take this hysteric away from me!

630
01:28:01,189 --> 01:28:07,424
- Mommy, what’s going on?
- What is this nonsense, young man?!

631
01:28:07,459 --> 01:28:10,818
You’re driving away your bride?

632
01:28:10,853 --> 01:28:13,392
Volodyka...

633
01:28:14,022 --> 01:28:18,118
Here’s your bride!
And this is her mom!

634
01:28:18,153 --> 01:28:23,068
Stop kidding me. Take this psycopath away,
otherwise I won’t be marrying.

635
01:28:30,125 --> 01:28:33,302
Ah, this is my bride?

636
01:28:33,337 --> 01:28:40,923
Mommy with boy and three girls?
Even better! No way!

637
01:28:40,958 --> 01:28:47,887
- Ah, so! That will cost you dearly.
Get out! -What’s up with you?

638
01:28:47,922 --> 01:28:50,983
Hold them!

639
01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:00,596
Seryega, ours are being beaten!

640
01:29:00,631 --> 01:29:06,035
Don’t give in to small time bourgeois!
Hold on ‘till I’m back!

641
01:29:18,133 --> 01:29:24,163
- I agree! You persuaded me!
- He agrees!

642
01:29:24,198 --> 01:29:27,789
Let the young husband go.

643
01:29:27,824 --> 01:29:31,380
He agrees, he agrees!

644
01:29:31,415 --> 01:29:34,532
Vova agrees.

645
01:29:46,377 --> 01:29:48,857
Place for the groom.

646
01:29:55,139 --> 01:29:59,132
Vladimir!

647
01:30:05,030 --> 01:30:13,406
- Everything so neat and well...
as it was before. -Bitter!

648
01:30:29,691 --> 01:30:33,314
Next day Volodyka Zavitushkin went to
registry office after work and got divorced.

649
01:30:34,885 --> 01:30:37,503
That's all there is to tell.
But you say:

650
01:30:38,458 --> 01:30:39,728
IT CAN'T BE

651
01:30:40,217 --> 01:30:52,977
<i>What you have seen is not an anecdote
and for sure not a fiction, contrarywise!</i>

652
01:30:53,353 --> 01:31:06,898
<i>Since life is complicated matter it can surprise
and even impossible can be possible!</i>

653
01:31:08,257 --> 01:31:14,365
<i>You can say us:
Why to ruminate?</i>

654
01:31:15,166 --> 01:31:19,266
<i>What is impossble is never possible.</i>

655
01:31:21,193 --> 01:31:25,120
<i>Sorry, life is complicated matter</i>

656
01:31:25,552 --> 01:31:33,937
<i>and even all the impossible
is possible!</i>
