1
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,150
Right, let's go...

2
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:31,549
Okay?

3
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:33,312
Is everyone here?

4
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,679
Can you all hear me?

5
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:46,629
Now then, we'll start
with a few neighbourhood houses,

6
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,109
then take the left side of the park

7
00:00:49,319 --> 00:00:52,470
via the flowery steps
at the end of the street.

8
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:56,238
SAME OLD SONG

9
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:57,997
Shall we go then?

10
00:01:09,639 --> 00:01:12,472
You will carry out
my orders immediately,

11
00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:13,873
Von Choltitz!

12
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,478
Yes, mein Führer!

13
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:18,871
For the last time,
Paris must be destroyed.

14
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,228
Within 24 hours!

15
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,547
Two loves in my life

16
00:01:40,279 --> 00:01:43,351
My home and Paree

17
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,393
In times of strife

18
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,711
They set my heart free

19
00:01:58,119 --> 00:01:59,791
Our tour ends here,

20
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:04,032
the very spot where,
behind that window there,

21
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,551
Von Choltitz decided
not to carry out Hitler's orders.

22
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,868
Von Choltitz's precise motives
remain obscure

23
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,915
but Paris was not destroyed,
although it was a close thing.

24
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,315
We know that explosives

25
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,149
had been placed
beneath every bridge in the city.

26
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,634
Now then...

27
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,993
If you'll follow me...

28
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,355
We'll go back to the metro...

29
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,957
where we met up earlier.

30
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,835
Sorry!

31
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,189
How about that!

32
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,470
What are you doing here?

33
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,672
I'm working. I live in Paris now.

34
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,357
Really...

35
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,198
- How are you?
- Fine. And you?

36
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,914
I'm fine, fine, fine as ever...

37
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,838
Still got that company?

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,752
Yes, still...

39
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,188
It's doing well.

40
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,549
Not bad...

41
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,674
Sorry, I can't remember your name.
I don't remember where we...

42
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,030
That's all right.
I'm Camille.

43
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,878
That's it... Camille...

44
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,713
Camille... Odile...

45
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,389
Camille-Odile?

46
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,591
Lalande,
Odile Lalande's sister.

47
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,316
Odile Lalande, of course!
Camille, Odile's sister, absolutely!

48
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,475
How about you?

49
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,749
Fine, I'm still...

50
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,155
No, what's your name?
Sorry...

51
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,157
I'm Nicolas...

52
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,430
Yes, Nicolas, of course...

53
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,158
So how's your sister?

54
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,749
She's fine. Everything's fine.

55
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:25,678
Sorry, I must dash.

56
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,437
Yes, me too.

57
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,994
I'll tell Odile I saw you.

58
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:34,114
It's odd,
I was planning to call her.

59
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,069
How odd...

60
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,351
I just got to Paris,
I haven't had time to...

61
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:40,550
No need to justify yourself.

62
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:43,114
I'm not, I'm just explaining.

63
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,713
Call her, she'll be glad to see you.

64
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:50,068
Same number?

65
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,348
It hasn't changed?

66
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:55,674
How long have you been away?

67
00:04:56,919 --> 00:04:58,147
I can't remember...

68
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,838
That long?

69
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,393
Eight years.

70
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,671
I can't believe it,
you haven't changed a bit.

71
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:08,109
I mean it, it's not just flattery.

72
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,991
You're more beautiful than ever.

73
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,349
Isn't she?

74
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:15,950
He tells all the women that.
It's a natural reflex.

75
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,548
You're like the breeze
in a violin,

76
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,596
bearing the scent of roses.

77
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:25,953
Caramel, candy and chocolate

78
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,195
At times,
I don't understand you.

79
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,071
Thank you, no, not for me...
Offer them to another

80
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:38,397
Who loves the wind
and scent of roses

81
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:41,716
Those sweet, honey words

82
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:47,312
May land on my lips
But will never touch my heart

83
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:49,231
One more word...

84
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:52,277
Words, words, words...

85
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,959
Why do you say that?

86
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,195
I've seen you at work.

87
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,152
Who are you trying
to make me out to be?

88
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,069
I really mean it, you're...

89
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,553
What can I say now?

90
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,512
I mean it, you're beautiful...

91
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,196
Claude?

92
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:12,911
He can't tell. He's used to me.

93
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:14,598
You can't tell, can you?

94
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:16,198
Of course I can.

95
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,510
- Well, am I right?
- Of course!

96
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:23,233
She's very beautiful.

97
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:25,194
Of course.

98
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:29,830
And your wife?

99
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:32,958
Are you happy?

100
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,717
Very. Very happy, yes.

101
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:35,875
Coffee?

102
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,831
Can you make coffee, Claude?

103
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:39,711
I'll make coffee...

104
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,428
Odile...

105
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,833
We haven't talked since you called
to say you were getting married.

106
00:06:57,799 --> 00:07:01,553
That's the last
I ever heard from you.

107
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:06,308
No!

108
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,313
Yes, it was!

109
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,076
Except for birth announcements.

110
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,032
See, you had
the birth announcements.

111
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:18,637
Do you make her suffer much?

112
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,075
Who?

113
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,188
Your wife.

114
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:24,828
- You're not too unfaithful?
- I don't believe it!

115
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,191
Why does everyone think
I'm still like that?

116
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:33,433
It's an old reputation
that was barely justified.

117
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,312
It makes no sense.

118
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,634
Honestly...

119
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,236
Want to see a photo of us?

120
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:48,236
During the Easter holidays...

121
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,308
They're so big!

122
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:57,154
They're sweet.

123
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:59,270
What does this remind me of?

124
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,630
I know! That cereal advert.
You know the one I mean?

125
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,591
Cereal? No, not really...

126
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:07,956
That family having breakfast
in a corn-field...

127
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:10,077
That rings a bell...

128
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:12,637
You look sweet together.

129
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,397
Are they joining you soon?

130
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,949
Once I find a flat,
in a fortnight or so...

131
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:24,393
Are you at a hotel?

132
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,273
Some five-star place,
Camille said...

133
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,279
Have we drunk a lot?

134
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,875
Have we?

135
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,436
I never have more than one glass.

136
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,756
That's good... Well, I mean...

137
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,236
Do you mind opening the window?

138
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,793
Not at all...

139
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,878
Could you open it?

140
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,634
Are you all right?

141
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,873
If I don't talk or move

142
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,672
for a while, I'll be okay.

143
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:27,470
He's watching you
From the corner of his eye

144
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:33,956
You're feeling blue
As you sit and wonder why

145
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,512
His eyes are a sweet caress

146
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:47,237
You sigh, you acquiesce

147
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:54,070
And I just sit here
I'm so near

148
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,272
I see it all

149
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:07,271
And I sit here
I sit in fear

150
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,471
As the end draws near

151
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:19,908
No, no, it's nothing,
I'm just a little weary.

152
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,992
No, not at all,
what are you trying to say?

153
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,314
No, no, I've had

154
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,272
a wonderful evening...

155
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,508
Do you know Nicolas's brother?

156
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,438
No, not at all.

157
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,708
The last time I saw him,
he was twelve or so.

158
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,195
Why? Do you think I was wrong?

159
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,073
Hadn't you hired someone?

160
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:55,510
He wasn't hired,
he hadn't signed the contract.

161
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,590
Besides, to be quite honest,

162
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,959
he didn't seem that interested...

163
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,269
He just sat there, looking as if...

164
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,080
Tell me if you think I was wrong!

165
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,511
I was just thinking...
I don't know why I thought of that.

166
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,349
Sorry, but he's a friend
who asked me to help his brother.

167
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,755
How could I have refused?

168
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,876
He's been unemployed for a year.
Could I have said no?

169
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,031
Would you have said no?

170
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,953
It's hard but it has to be

171
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,720
You can't always be honest, see

172
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,194
I'm devious, me

173
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,559
To keep my head above water

174
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,799
Why should I feel guilty?
It's normal to help friends out.

175
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,593
Everyone does it.

176
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,910
Everyone.

177
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,436
I'm falling asleep here...

178
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,189
Besides,
I'm glad to be able to help.

179
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,391
Look at me! You make me guilty
and then doze off...

180
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,350
You struggle and strive
To help men thrive

181
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,916
But you can't satisfy
The whole damn hive

182
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,510
You toil and strain
But all in vain

183
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,315
You can't satisfy
the whole of Spain

184
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,438
That's bad news...

185
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,592
I know... I'm sorry.

186
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,713
What can I do now?
You've put me in quite a spot...

187
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,953
I had no choice...

188
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,232
But three days ago,
you said I was hired...

189
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,074
Yes, I know...
I'm really sorry about this.

190
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:44,797
You don't think I am?

191
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,554
Don't make things
any harder for me.

192
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,637
It's bad enough as it is.

193
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,637
Make things hard for you?

194
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,868
I don't know what more I can say...

195
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,796
Tell me, how come the job existed
just three days ago?

196
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,479
Restructuring...

197
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,795
Over the weekend?

198
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,712
Yes. It happened very fast.

199
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,153
It's hard but it has to be

200
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,874
You can't always be honest, see

201
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,911
I'm devious, me

202
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,078
To keep my head above water

203
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,350
You'll soon find something!

204
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,080
You have an excellent CV.
You should...

205
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,474
It's been two years now.

206
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,671
You see,
that doesn't mean anything.

207
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,838
You almost found a job here.
There's no reason...

208
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,195
Just be patient, that's all.

209
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,110
My spleen is green

210
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,390
My gut is kaput

211
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,716
My throat's like a moat

212
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,711
My ribs are squibs

213
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,390
All right, sit down, my dear fellow,
sit down...

214
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,873
I'm sorry... I can't get dressed
sitting down...

215
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,470
Now then,
this heart doesn't look too bad.

216
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:21,988
It'll last a few years yet.

217
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,317
"Not too bad"?
So it's partly bad?

218
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,318
The gentleman's getting in a flap!
Don't panic.

219
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,476
Sit down.

220
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,396
Now, what do you understand
by palpitations?

221
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,669
Just a second...

222
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,239
No, he didn't last long...

223
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,675
I never told him, don't worry.

224
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,836
Well now!

225
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,879
My dear fellow, I don't see
anything to worry about.

226
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,956
You said you had palpitations

227
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,078
but palpitations is a word

228
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,671
people use any-old-how.
It doesn't really mean much.

229
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,358
I think you just need
to relax a little.

230
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,274
If you carry on like this,
you may end up

231
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,113
with an ulcer, understand?

232
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,234
So just relax.

233
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,559
Ride a bicycle...

234
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,672
And let it palpitate, old chap.

235
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,158
It has to palpitate,
it's all pipes and pumps in there.

236
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,713
It has to work, see?

237
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,717
Off you go and don't come back.

238
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,996
Now we'll walk over to the dome...

239
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,672
Tell me if you can't hear.

240
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,030
It's best if you can all hear me.

241
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,713
From here,
we can see the full setting...

242
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,716
Odile Lalande, please...

243
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,189
Yes, I'll hold.

244
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,995
I struggle, I struggle

245
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,270
I struggle as hard as can be

246
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:18,039
I struggle, I struggle

247
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,519
Hello, Mrs Lalande?

248
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,958
Marc Duveyrier here.

249
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,472
Very well and yourself?

250
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,191
Sorry to disturb you
but I wondered if you'd decided.

251
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,960
Are you getting there?

252
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,917
You want to see it again.
I was going to suggest that.

253
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,351
Of course...
What would you say

254
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,392
to four o'clock? Yes?

255
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,718
Near the usual pile of plates?

256
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,111
I'll see you later then.

257
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,230
Not at all, only normal.

258
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,431
My pleasure, Mrs Lalande.

259
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,159
See you later, Odile.

260
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,912
Come on now!

261
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:21,508
I like girls in a swank hotel

262
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,228
I like girls in denim jeans

263
00:17:25,399 --> 00:17:29,074
I like girls you see in Elle

264
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:32,436
I like the girls in magazines

265
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,034
Camille...
It's Odile, just a quick message...

266
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:39,072
It's about the flat...
I'm seeing it again at four.

267
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,078
We're meeting outside,
near that sculpture...

268
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:45,833
I'd like you to come.
Try to.

269
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:47,074
Take care.

270
00:17:58,839 --> 00:17:59,954
Is everyone here?

271
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:03,067
The Bois de Vincennes
lay to the east

272
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,352
and the Bois de Boulogne
to the west.

273
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,269
Napoleon III asked Haussmann
to design two new parks,

274
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:12,668
one to the south,

275
00:18:12,879 --> 00:18:16,030
the Parc Montsouris,
as you probably guessed,

276
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:19,914
and the other to the north,
this one, the Buttes-Chaumont.

277
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:22,395
They were inaugurated in 1867...

278
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:24,556
For the Universal Exhibition...

279
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:27,068
Yes, 1867...
The Universal Exhibition.

280
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,318
Exactly,
on April 1, 1867,

281
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:32,635
for the Universal Exhibition,
well done.

282
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:38,669
You may think the park was named
for some historical figure

283
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,313
but in actual fact...

284
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:44,074
It was the Mont Chauve, wasn't it?
The Mont Chauve?

285
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:49,390
...the desert-like aspect
of this former quarry,

286
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:51,829
earned it the name of...

287
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:53,637
Montchauve!

288
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:55,113
I don't see how...

289
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:58,197
Montchauve, chauve-mont
and Chaumont.

290
00:18:58,399 --> 00:18:59,195
There!

291
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:04,388
Did everyone hear that?

292
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:34,111
Are you all right?

293
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:35,678
Don't get up!

294
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:37,232
No, I can get up.

295
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:40,351
I'm all right,
don't fret.

296
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:43,514
That bastard didn't even stop!

297
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:46,635
- Bastard!
- I'm all right.

298
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:49,230
Don't fret.

299
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,952
It was my own fault.

300
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,196
It wasn't your fault! No way!

301
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,388
Damn, I didn't get his number!
What a scatterbrain!

302
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:00,594
Did anyone get that car's number?

303
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,158
Don't fret...

304
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:13,797
Everyone still with us?

305
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,116
Now then,

306
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:20,358
where this magnificent park
now stands...

307
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,355
Shows?

308
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:25,029
The Paris middle-classes
would come up here for them...

309
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,789
...you'd find a whole array
of outcasts, a den of thieves...

310
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:32,915
Sir! Excuse me, sir...

311
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,191
It's obvious you know this park
inside out

312
00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:38,310
but I'm guiding this tour.

313
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:42,558
If you don't mind, I'd like to do
my job properly.

314
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:45,876
If you talk when I do,
it ruins my concentration.

315
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,398
I understand perfectly.

316
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,633
Thank you, you're too kind.

317
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:56,831
Let me see...

318
00:20:57,199 --> 00:20:58,632
This little bridge

319
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,712
didn't become famous
as a lovers' walk

320
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,514
but for a more sinister reason.

321
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:07,471
Did she say its name?

322
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,954
No, not yet.
It's the Suicides' Bridge.

323
00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:11,797
The lady asked me...

324
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:14,559
Yes, I wasn't sure about...

325
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:19,951
Do you live nearby?

326
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:21,589
No.

327
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:27,274
I was meeting my grandson here.

328
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,435
I was late, I ran out like a fool
without even looking.

329
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:37,231
Don't keep on saying that,
it's all over now...

330
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,594
I hope he hasn't gone.

331
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,836
No, he'll be here,
if he said he'd meet you.

332
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:46,952
Do you feel better?

333
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:53,197
They must have had
quite a long talk

334
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:55,236
to reach an agreement.

335
00:21:55,879 --> 00:21:58,347
He's been in such a state
for three days...

336
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:00,869
He came to sign his contract.

337
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:06,557
He'd been after work for two years,
it was such a relief!

338
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,033
I can imagine.

339
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:09,911
A real stroke of luck too,

340
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:14,316
what with his wife
having her baby soon.

341
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:17,872
Ah yes, indeed... A lucky break.

342
00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:20,277
He was signing today?

343
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:21,668
That's right.

344
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:25,832
Until it's signed,
you can't be sure.

345
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:28,149
No, it was sure.

346
00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:32,108
No, don't say that, nothing's sure
without written proof.

347
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:35,356
Anything can happen...
Don't get your hopes up.

348
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:39,833
Were you meeting
a young man here?

349
00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:43,391
He's at the maternity ward,
he dashed off.

350
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:44,998
He was meeting his grandfather.

351
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:48,714
He gave me a description
and then he was off.

352
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:50,272
He's at the maternity ward.

353
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:53,949
I'd better get going...
How much do I owe you?

354
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,592
No, no, let me...

355
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,471
No, no, really.

356
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:04,595
Thank you so much...
I have to be going.

357
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,068
I'll give you a lift.

358
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:24,792
I'll take you there.

359
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:26,990
Don't fret. You've done enough.

360
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:28,598
It's no problem!

361
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,312
No, I'll be glad to!

362
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:33,192
I'll take you, it's no big deal...

363
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:01,275
It's a feeling of déjà-vu

364
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:05,429
This isn't my first time here

365
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:09,952
I'm sure now, it's true

366
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,277
I've heard that tune somewhere

367
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,398
Excuse me...

368
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:30,912
I was in your group...

369
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:37,478
I may have annoyed you... I didn't
notice until it was too late.

370
00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:39,231
It's all right.

371
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:43,997
I have to share what I know...
It's stupid.

372
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:47,271
No, it's not.
Have you thought of being a guide?

373
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:48,992
That might help.

374
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,510
Perhaps I should try it.

375
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,872
Well, I won't bother you any longer.

376
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:12,193
This is yours, isn't it?

377
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:15,350
You're interested
in female poisoners?

378
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:18,674
It's good...
Not the definitive work...

379
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:20,318
Not the definitive work?

380
00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:21,914
I see...

381
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,232
You've been on other tours.
I've seen you before, haven't I?

382
00:25:32,439 --> 00:25:34,316
Yes, once or twice...

383
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:36,558
You like history?

384
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,475
Yes, I use it in my work,
I write radio plays.

385
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:43,193
- Historical ones?
- Slightly romanticized...

386
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:47,508
So, do you have a job?
Apart from...

387
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:48,873
I'm doing my thesis.

388
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:50,512
What on?

389
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,998
The yeomen of the year 1000
at Paladru Lake.

390
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:57,067
That's good.

391
00:25:57,719 --> 00:25:59,550
It's time someone did that.

392
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:02,035
What do you plan to do after?

393
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:04,753
That's the problem.
What can I do after?

394
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:08,708
No, I'm joking.
I'll keep at it...

395
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:12,394
I'd like to do research
and all that...

396
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,878
Nothing stirred on Red Square

397
00:26:35,639 --> 00:26:38,392
Ahead of me walked Nathalie

398
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,193
My guide with a name so fair
Nathalie!

399
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:50,989
Are you okay? You look pale...

400
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:04,549
Miss Rigotti's room, please.

401
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:06,078
Rigotti...

402
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:07,917
R.I.G.O.T.T.I...

403
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:09,917
Room 228, second floor.

404
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:11,552
228, thank you.

405
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:13,272
The lift's just there...

406
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:19,270
Come on up,
I'll introduce you to my grandson.

407
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:26,991
Thank you so much...

408
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,312
for everything.
You've been wonderful.

409
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,629
Yes, quite wonderful.

410
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:43,950
No, this is silly.

411
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,627
I shouldn't be here at all.

412
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,871
Just tell him I'm sorry.

413
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:51,398
I'm sorry.

414
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:04,747
Fine, fine...

415
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:07,997
And you won't go back
on that decision?

416
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:13,711
Yes. Yes, I understand...

417
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:19,510
I don't have much choice...

418
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,398
Yes, maybe. Who knows?

419
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:27,749
Sure.

420
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:46,434
Excuse me...

421
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,478
Are you waiting for someone?

422
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:54,630
Not Odile Lalande,
by any chance?

423
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:58,552
She's my sister,
I'm meeting her here too.

424
00:28:58,719 --> 00:28:59,868
She asked me to...

425
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:02,718
How do you do?
Marc Duveyrier.

426
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:04,238
I was wondering...

427
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:07,317
Me too,
I don't know where she's got to...

428
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,147
Excuse me...

429
00:29:09,439 --> 00:29:10,872
Oh, don't mind me...

430
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:15,915
We can do this some other time.

431
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:17,592
Whatever for?

432
00:29:19,999 --> 00:29:22,354
I don't know...
perhaps you'd rather be at home?

433
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:25,273
Oh no, I've got time...
All the time in the world.

434
00:29:25,479 --> 00:29:28,152
I mean, if you don't feel well...

435
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:30,509
Don't worry, I'll get over it.

436
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:32,437
Of course, but...

437
00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:35,949
The first few days are the worst...

438
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,671
It wipes you out...

439
00:29:46,639 --> 00:29:48,357
It's odd she's not here.

440
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,629
Quite worrying in fact,
it's not like her.

441
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:06,196
Never worry
'bout the troubles in life

442
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:09,389
Me, I never do

443
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:13,396
Come tomorrow, it's good-bye strife

444
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:15,515
Wait and see, it's true

445
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:18,950
You're lucky,
you look on the bright side.

446
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:21,229
I'm not the type
to worry about life...

447
00:30:21,439 --> 00:30:22,633
Too right.

448
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:27,033
Know what we're going to do?

449
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:29,913
You came to see the apartment,
didn't you?

450
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:31,354
Let's go up.

451
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:35,029
She'll guess where we are,
she'll come and find us...

452
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:35,911
Well?

453
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:39,077
You think so?
Yes, she's bound to realize...

454
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,750
At least we'll be warm up there.

455
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:43,790
Yes, that's true...

456
00:30:43,999 --> 00:30:44,988
Come on,

457
00:30:45,199 --> 00:30:46,268
it's this way.

458
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:49,276
Is it far?

459
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,312
Odile Lalande?

460
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:56,318
I don't know her.

461
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:59,317
I mentioned her
when I first called you.

462
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,908
It wasn't me you spoke to.
It was my boss.

463
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:04,595
You're not Marc Duveyrier?

464
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,027
No, he's my boss.

465
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:10,354
I'm afraid he couldn't come.
An important matter to see to...

466
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:13,991
So you get the unimportant ones.

467
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:16,988
- You know what I mean.
- You bet I do.

468
00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:21,036
Now...
Have I brought the keys?

469
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:24,519
Rather, have I brought
the right keys?

470
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:25,954
Here we are!

471
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,831
No, this is no good at all.
I don't like it.

472
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,154
At least see it.

473
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,874
All right, I'll have a look but...

474
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:42,553
It's too small...

475
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:46,073
710 square feet,
plus the mezzanine...

476
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,911
You said 8,000 to 12,000 a month.
This one's 10,000.

477
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,587
10,000! It's very small.

478
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:57,078
Don't you think 10,000
is a bit steep?

479
00:31:57,239 --> 00:31:58,911
It's daylight robbery.

480
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:00,711
We agree on that then!

481
00:32:02,719 --> 00:32:04,152
Do you let many flats?

482
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:05,269
What?

483
00:32:05,719 --> 00:32:09,598
To be quite honest,
I'm not all that motivated today.

484
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,597
Nothing stirred on Red Square

485
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:16,953
Ahead of me walked Nathalie

486
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:22,872
My guide with a name so fair
Nathalie!

487
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,954
The yeomen of the year 1000
at Paladru Lake.

488
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:36,115
It's true,
there's an amazing view.

489
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:41,152
This flat's gigantic...

490
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,997
It is a fine size.

491
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:46,551
My sister is so excited about it.
I can see why now.

492
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:49,269
I never imagined this.

493
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,957
The view
is one of the selling points.

494
00:32:53,999 --> 00:32:55,478
And in this light, it's...

495
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:56,714
Beautiful...

496
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,959
It's one of my favourite
times of day.

497
00:33:02,199 --> 00:33:03,552
Mine too, in fact.

498
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:08,032
It's soothing...

499
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:12,116
That's the word, "soothing".

500
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,753
You feel...

501
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:20,158
You have a fine view of that
marvellous modern sculpture...

502
00:33:22,879 --> 00:33:24,198
Lovely, isn't it?

503
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:25,674
Very!

504
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,108
Besides...

505
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:31,031
that's where we met.

506
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,115
Come here and sit by me, my dear

507
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:49,755
I'm shy but it won't last,
never fear

508
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:55,431
Does it mean you don't like me?

509
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,068
Oh, my kitten,
I've been smitten

510
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,749
- What about this pretty lace?
- Gorgeous!

511
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:04,955
- And this beauty spot on my face?
- Luscious!

512
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:06,274
- And my size?
- I don't despise!

513
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:07,628
- And my thighs?
- What a prize!

514
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:10,558
- And the rest?
- I'm as hot as an oven of pies!

515
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,109
Well?

516
00:34:13,799 --> 00:34:15,118
What do you think?

517
00:34:15,279 --> 00:34:16,268
Of what?

518
00:34:16,799 --> 00:34:18,152
The flat.

519
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,907
It's nice. It's very nice.

520
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,314
- Do you like kisses in your ear?
- Good Lord!

521
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:29,589
- And caresses, my dear?
- Oh, my word!

522
00:34:29,799 --> 00:34:30,834
Can I tickle?

523
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:32,154
And prickle?

524
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:34,554
And the rest?

525
00:34:34,759 --> 00:34:37,068
- I'm a crazy man, it's true
- Maybe so...

526
00:34:37,279 --> 00:34:39,429
- Totally crazy for you
- Yes, I know!

527
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,708
I'm in a stew

528
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:41,908
It's all through

529
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:44,349
And the rest?

530
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:46,754
Well, since we both agree

531
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:49,194
Come to my arms again

532
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:52,994
Let's stay together here,
forget the rest, my dear

533
00:34:55,959 --> 00:34:58,348
She won't be coming now...

534
00:34:58,519 --> 00:34:59,998
I'd better go.

535
00:35:00,279 --> 00:35:01,758
We can wait a while...

536
00:35:04,399 --> 00:35:06,196
We can wait a while...

537
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:13,799
Isn't there a light anywhere?

538
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,513
I don't know if the...

539
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:26,235
You're here in the dark!

540
00:35:27,399 --> 00:35:28,957
What do you think?

541
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:34,790
Serious, thoughtful...
prudent!

542
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,234
Claude is prudent.

543
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:38,277
Those are supposed
to be qualities.

544
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,991
Isn't that too many for one man?

545
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,828
I'm talking rubbish.

546
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:46,791
You know what I mean...

547
00:35:46,999 --> 00:35:49,354
There are no flights of fancy
and all that...

548
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:53,230
He hates going out...
Well, that's his right...

549
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:57,278
I'm not really complaining...
Everything's fine.

550
00:35:57,759 --> 00:35:59,078
Better than fine...

551
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,398
Well, normal.

552
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:08,357
Why was I saying that?

553
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:12,518
I don't know if I'd have put up
with someone too... See?

554
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:13,356
Yes, too...

555
00:36:13,999 --> 00:36:14,909
Exactly!

556
00:36:16,399 --> 00:36:17,718
Like me, for instance.

557
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:21,038
Yes, for instance.

558
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:24,434
You chose well.

559
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:32,833
Hold on,
when you say flights of fancy,

560
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:37,555
what do you mean?
A surprise trip to Venice? A ring?

561
00:36:37,759 --> 00:36:39,750
No, that's not the problem.

562
00:36:40,759 --> 00:36:44,434
There again, a ring,
out of the blue, why not?

563
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,909
No, you see...

564
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,593
what annoys me
is that I make all the decisions.

565
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,348
He agrees,
if I'm happy, he's happy too.

566
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:55,914
I just wish
he'd take the initiative,

567
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,395
show some enthusiasm
for something...

568
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:00,231
They're just minor details.

569
00:37:00,399 --> 00:37:03,197
He's sweet...
He's very sweet.

570
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:06,077
I like Claude...

571
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,438
How's my brother doing?

572
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:18,789
Not too much out of his depth,
is he?

573
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:21,830
He is?

574
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:25,395
He's not into the swim of it
but that's normal at first.

575
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,112
He's very good...
He seems very...

576
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:33,470
very attentive.

577
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:38,510
Thanks anyway,
you didn't have to...

578
00:37:41,799 --> 00:37:43,755
- Okay?
- Fine.

579
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:49,355
Right... I'll get going...

580
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:53,109
- The family genius.
- Oh no, Odile!

581
00:37:53,279 --> 00:37:56,351
I'm just teasing!
Still, you are the family genius.

582
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:58,914
I'm proud of my little sister,
it's my right.

583
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,998
Did I say
she's got her viva on the 28th?

584
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:03,154
Really?

585
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,389
What's your thesis on?

586
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,994
On... er... On nothing.

587
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,554
That won't take long.

588
00:38:11,759 --> 00:38:13,511
The year 1000
at Yeoman Lake.

589
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:15,550
No, Odile, that's not it.

590
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:16,669
It isn't?

591
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:18,517
Well then, what is it?

592
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:20,118
The yeomen of the year 1000
at Paladru Lake.

593
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,799
Isn't that what I said?

594
00:38:22,479 --> 00:38:23,150
What lake?

595
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:24,633
Paladru!

596
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:32,996
Sorry, but is anyone
interested in that?

597
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,878
No, nobody.

598
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:37,513
Why choose it then?

599
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:39,555
To set fools blabbing!

600
00:38:39,759 --> 00:38:41,272
Camille!

601
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,033
I only asked to be polite.

602
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:47,718
I realized.

603
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:50,237
Be indulgent with fools...

604
00:38:50,439 --> 00:38:51,758
I do what I can.

605
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:01,117
- More coffee?
- No, I must be going.

606
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,637
Have you found a flat?

607
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,469
I'm still looking but it's hard.
It has to suit my wife.

608
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:15,308
I describe places over the phone...
It's not easy.

609
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:16,589
I'll call you.

610
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:25,955
He gets on my nerves...

611
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:27,387
I noticed.

612
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:30,390
Sorry, but I can't stand him.

613
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,476
What did he do?

614
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:34,512
Nothing, I just can't stand him.

615
00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:36,711
Always playing the wise guy...

616
00:39:36,879 --> 00:39:40,918
Not at all! You were so aggressive!
He asked a simple question.

617
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,952
What came over you?
I felt so awkward!

618
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:48,472
It's always the same.

619
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:53,317
They ask what it's about,
you tell them and they laugh.

620
00:39:56,879 --> 00:40:00,315
I realize I was aggressive,
I realize that.

621
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:05,795
I'm sorry, I didn't want
to make you feel uncomfortable...

622
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,712
I apologize.

623
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:12,918
Forgive me?

624
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,829
I'll call him, poor thing...

625
00:40:20,279 --> 00:40:22,474
Well, tell me then...

626
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:23,236
What?

627
00:40:23,439 --> 00:40:25,157
Stop it. Well?

628
00:40:27,479 --> 00:40:29,709
I saw him yesterday,
I'm seeing him tonight.

629
00:40:29,999 --> 00:40:31,557
It's all so fast.

630
00:40:32,479 --> 00:40:35,198
Apparently, he's getting over
an affair that was...

631
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,511
well, fairly painful.

632
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:40,870
When we met,
he was in such a state...

633
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:42,990
It's silly but it touched me...

634
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:45,912
seeing him with his guard down
like that.

635
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,512
He didn't try to hide it...

636
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:48,947
It's thanks to me...

637
00:40:49,399 --> 00:40:50,957
I'm so happy.

638
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:53,070
Marc's so sweet...

639
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:54,708
But you...

640
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,955
You're not forgetting your work,
I hope.

641
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,237
I don't give a damn

642
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:04,674
About what happens to me
I don't give a damn

643
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:09,677
I've got a man you see
Perhaps it's all flimflam

644
00:41:09,919 --> 00:41:15,789
People can stand and stare
It's all one to me, I don't care

645
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:20,836
He's got strong arms to hold me

646
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:24,990
His body's soft and warm

647
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:26,754
His lips carry

648
00:41:26,959 --> 00:41:28,551
kisses for me

649
00:41:29,799 --> 00:41:32,711
Oh, his passion's like a storm

650
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:34,916
And when we dance

651
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:37,475
In his arms, I feel...

652
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:39,078
Well?

653
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,791
I don't know...

654
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,909
Have we thought it over?
Aren't we rushing it?

655
00:41:46,959 --> 00:41:50,747
Do we need the burden
of such a big loan? I don't know.

656
00:41:51,439 --> 00:41:53,794
There's the view...
The area's smarter...

657
00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:57,309
I want a bigger, nicer place
in a smarter area!

658
00:41:57,519 --> 00:41:58,588
What's so...

659
00:41:58,799 --> 00:42:01,597
Maybe we can think it over
a little longer.

660
00:42:01,799 --> 00:42:04,154
If we keep saying that,
we'll never move.

661
00:42:05,279 --> 00:42:07,110
It's a lovely flat,

662
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,117
the view's exceptional...

663
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:11,512
I like it. Don't you?

664
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:12,913
Of course...

665
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,030
But we could wait a while...

666
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:17,799
It will slip through our fingers
if we do!

667
00:42:18,439 --> 00:42:20,191
What can I say then?

668
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,078
Let's go for it.
Yes, all right. In any case...

669
00:42:24,279 --> 00:42:26,839
"In any case" what?
I asked your opinion!

670
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:28,797
I gave you my opinion.

671
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:32,028
We'll do what you want.
What more can I say?

672
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:35,072
No, don't say "what you want"
all the time.

673
00:42:35,279 --> 00:42:37,998
You won't make me happy
by saying that!

674
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:41,396
You don't want my opinion.
You just want me to agree.

675
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,510
I'm doing the best I can!

676
00:42:55,559 --> 00:42:57,117
It's true...

677
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:02,230
It is a nice flat...
A very nice flat.

678
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:07,037
I sent flowers and chocolates
to the maternity ward.

679
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:11,038
To the maternity ward?

680
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:15,388
When I took the old man there,
I noted the girl's name.

681
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,911
I thought I'd send something...
So I sent flowers and chocolates.

682
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,558
Yes, that's kind...

683
00:43:23,759 --> 00:43:25,511
- Stop it, will you?
- What?

684
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:26,469
Is that irony?

685
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:29,591
Of course not!
No, it's kind...

686
00:43:30,199 --> 00:43:32,076
It won't make up for...

687
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:33,997
But it's a kind gesture...

688
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:37,711
I'll send him a cheque.

689
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:39,474
That's ridiculous...

690
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:42,273
Just a little cheque
as compensation.

691
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,158
If it makes you happy...

692
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:53,870
How's Nicolas's brother doing?

693
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:55,034
He's hopeless.

694
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,353
It's about the cheque...

695
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:00,070
- What cheque?
- That you sent my wife.

696
00:44:00,279 --> 00:44:01,189
Your wife?

697
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:02,588
Karine Rigotti.

698
00:44:03,319 --> 00:44:04,069
Rigotti?

699
00:44:04,879 --> 00:44:06,710
She isn't your wife!

700
00:44:07,639 --> 00:44:10,870
She is. We're not married
but we live together.

701
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:11,795
Oh, my God!

702
00:44:11,999 --> 00:44:14,672
Lots of people aren't married and...

703
00:44:14,879 --> 00:44:16,437
Yes, of course...

704
00:44:16,879 --> 00:44:18,198
Well now...

705
00:44:19,959 --> 00:44:21,472
We were embarrassed,

706
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:25,194
we thought: "What do we do,
do we go and see her?"

707
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:26,554
We didn't know.

708
00:44:26,759 --> 00:44:29,751
My grandfather tells everyone
how kind you were.

709
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:32,473
"What a woman," he keeps saying.

710
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,516
Then the flowers and chocolates...

711
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:38,189
We wanted to write
but we didn't have your address.

712
00:44:38,359 --> 00:44:40,395
And then the cheque, well...

713
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:44,716
I'm very pleased,
I won't deny that...

714
00:44:44,919 --> 00:44:45,988
But it's money.

715
00:44:46,759 --> 00:44:48,556
Can we really accept?

716
00:44:48,759 --> 00:44:51,432
I would think:
"Who is this maniac?" too.

717
00:44:54,879 --> 00:44:56,631
We didn't think that.

718
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,991
We just wondered
why you were being so kind.

719
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:03,635
I know, we don't know each other,
it's ridiculous!

720
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,873
I won't explain why.

721
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,917
Your grandfather's sweet...

722
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:14,472
He had a fall...

723
00:45:14,999 --> 00:45:16,478
No, it's complicated...

724
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:19,147
Look, the damage
has been done now.

725
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:23,115
All right...

726
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:27,275
keep the cheque, forget everything
and I won't bother you again.

727
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:38,514
True, you can see the Sacré-Coeur...

728
00:45:39,479 --> 00:45:41,197
It's dangerous
but you can see it.

729
00:45:41,399 --> 00:45:44,675
Besides, an occasional quick glance
will do.

730
00:45:45,399 --> 00:45:47,037
What are those? Cockles

731
00:45:47,799 --> 00:45:48,629
or clams?

732
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:51,433
I rather like it actually.

733
00:45:51,799 --> 00:45:53,027
I know her.

734
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:54,393
Camille!

735
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:57,831
You know Camille?

736
00:45:57,999 --> 00:46:01,389
I know her sister, in fact.
Odile Lalande.

737
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,956
She's the one who told me
to call your boss.

738
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:07,035
You know Camille...

739
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:09,036
You didn't hear, her sister...

740
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:10,991
Told you to call. I heard.

741
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,315
Is she a friend of yours?

742
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:15,794
We've met a couple of times.

743
00:46:15,999 --> 00:46:17,910
- Let's call her...
- No, don't!

744
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,076
All right...

745
00:46:22,439 --> 00:46:25,749
I want to ask you a favour.
It's a bit absurd but...

746
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:28,997
when I met her I told her
I write radio plays.

747
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:30,871
Right, that is absurd.

748
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:32,473
I do write radio plays.

749
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:33,867
Sorry...

750
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:36,469
But I didn't say
I worked in real estate.

751
00:46:36,679 --> 00:46:39,193
I had no reason to tell her.

752
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,908
If she'd asked me what I did,
I'd have told her.

753
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,314
There's no shame in it...

754
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:47,192
No, I just haven't had
the chance yet.

755
00:46:47,399 --> 00:46:51,631
In the meantime,
please don't tell her. I'll do it.

756
00:46:51,799 --> 00:46:54,472
All right... But right now...

757
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:55,469
What?

758
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,479
Sorry,
but it's all very complicated.

759
00:46:58,679 --> 00:47:00,829
You've just missed your chance.

760
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:03,837
You could say hello, normally,
and then...

761
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:06,792
I don't want to tell her now.
Some other day!

762
00:47:06,999 --> 00:47:09,308
It's no good now,
I don't have time.

763
00:47:09,799 --> 00:47:11,198
I don't want to, see?

764
00:47:11,399 --> 00:47:13,549
I think I understand now.

765
00:47:15,439 --> 00:47:18,590
What about her?
How does she feel?

766
00:47:18,759 --> 00:47:19,908
Does she share...

767
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,554
No, she's just met someone...

768
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:27,837
I was on the phone

769
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:31,793
with this streaming cold, see...

770
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:35,236
I finished my call,
I can't remember who it was...

771
00:47:35,439 --> 00:47:37,999
The Italian woman
we nearly sold to.

772
00:47:38,199 --> 00:47:39,712
That dump near St Lazare?

773
00:47:39,919 --> 00:47:41,113
That's it!

774
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:45,950
So, I hang up and wipe my eyes,
I blow my nose...

775
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:47,638
I mean, I had a cold.

776
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:50,831
Camille,
who was waiting just next to me,

777
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:54,475
got it into her head
that I was crying,

778
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:58,758
that a woman had just dumped me,
that I was upset and all.

779
00:47:58,919 --> 00:48:03,117
That's how she fell for me,
with "my guard down".

780
00:48:03,399 --> 00:48:04,434
Funny, isn't it?

781
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:08,552
It is... but how did she react
when she found out?

782
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:09,988
I haven't told her.

783
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:14,078
This is my wife's parents' place...
their country house.

784
00:48:15,279 --> 00:48:16,473
In Kent.

785
00:48:18,439 --> 00:48:19,713
Happy little family...

786
00:48:20,999 --> 00:48:23,911
What does this remind me of?
It reminds me of something...

787
00:48:24,919 --> 00:48:26,716
An ad for breakfast cereal?

788
00:48:27,399 --> 00:48:29,310
Yes, maybe...

789
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,392
There you go, it's nothing much,
it was just to...

790
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:40,032
She gets on my nerves.

791
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:42,076
- Who does?
- Camille.

792
00:48:42,439 --> 00:48:45,476
- Why?
- No reason, I find her...

793
00:48:45,959 --> 00:48:47,915
I don't know... arrogant.

794
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:49,393
You don't know her!

795
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,555
The bit I know gets on my nerves!

796
00:48:52,279 --> 00:48:54,076
It was the same years ago.

797
00:48:54,279 --> 00:48:57,191
Very sure of herself,
always successful...

798
00:48:57,919 --> 00:49:00,513
And dry with it...
Don't you find her dry?

799
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:03,633
Yes, she can be a little dry but...

800
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:06,838
I've twisted my neck
with the Sacré-Coeur.

801
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:09,150
I bet I've sprained something.

802
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:12,191
Have you seen her bloke?

803
00:49:12,919 --> 00:49:15,069
I don't particularly want to.

804
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:20,069
I know he always buys her flowers.
She loves that.

805
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:22,555
Love's blooming,
I stand no chance.

806
00:49:22,799 --> 00:49:25,313
It's my fault,
I went about it all wrong.

807
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,796
I got into a rut with her.
It's too hard to explain.

808
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:33,277
But now, unfortunately,
I have to play the bosom friend.

809
00:49:34,279 --> 00:49:35,997
No sex but a lot of listening...

810
00:49:36,959 --> 00:49:40,190
An older brother or a father...
which is even worse.

811
00:49:41,719 --> 00:49:43,232
Well then?

812
00:49:43,959 --> 00:49:46,268
What do you think of the flat?

813
00:49:46,879 --> 00:49:48,915
It's a bit gloomy...

814
00:49:49,759 --> 00:49:51,715
My wife may find it gloomy.

815
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:54,394
She'll have to see it.

816
00:49:54,879 --> 00:49:56,232
She'll have to see it.

817
00:49:57,519 --> 00:49:59,669
Will she be here soon?

818
00:49:59,879 --> 00:50:03,155
In a week or so,
she'll pop over for the day.

819
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:10,827
Anyway, of the last ten we've seen,
this is the best, right?

820
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:32,758
They always impress me.
Aren't they handsome?

821
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:41,758
My fuses have blown

822
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:45,108
The power's gone out

823
00:50:47,319 --> 00:50:49,708
I can't find the phone

824
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:53,637
I mean, what's this about?

825
00:50:54,919 --> 00:50:57,308
It makes me wanna shout

826
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:02,111
Oh, oh, love's sent me crazy

827
00:51:04,039 --> 00:51:07,156
You've got the fever in Saigon

828
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:11,196
I send myself cards from Canton

829
00:51:12,279 --> 00:51:15,510
Any more and I'll flip my lid

830
00:51:16,399 --> 00:51:20,153
And they'll say he did what he did

831
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:23,118
Love's sent me crazy

832
00:51:23,799 --> 00:51:25,152
Must be hard to wear.

833
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:28,271
No, it makes them look good.

834
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,559
Maybe I should dress
as a guard next time.

835
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,277
I can't quite picture it.

836
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:38,907
Neither can I.

837
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,390
I'll give you a few minutes

838
00:51:44,679 --> 00:51:47,432
to ponder
upon Victor Noir's strange fate.

839
00:51:50,999 --> 00:51:52,034
What was I saying?

840
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:54,514
Yes, it's near Grenoble...

841
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,189
It's a small lake,
called Paladru Lake.

842
00:51:57,399 --> 00:52:00,630
Amazingly, the site is untouched.

843
00:52:00,799 --> 00:52:04,269
It's like a snapshot
of life in the Middle Ages.

844
00:52:04,959 --> 00:52:06,711
I heard your play yesterday.

845
00:52:06,919 --> 00:52:08,034
Did you like it?

846
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,153
I do a tour
to Madame Brinvilliers's house.

847
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:14,196
I know, I took that tour.

848
00:52:15,239 --> 00:52:17,230
That's where I first saw you.

849
00:52:18,959 --> 00:52:20,597
I don't agree.

850
00:52:21,959 --> 00:52:24,075
You show Madame Brinvilliers

851
00:52:24,479 --> 00:52:27,039
as a monster.
I don't agree with that.

852
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:29,077
She poisoned her whole family...

853
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:31,839
Obviously, I'm not denying that.

854
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:36,557
She was raped at the age of seven
and both her brothers had her...

855
00:52:36,759 --> 00:52:40,069
She was raped at seven?
Both her brothers had her?

856
00:52:40,279 --> 00:52:42,668
It changes the whole deal.

857
00:52:45,799 --> 00:52:48,393
But I tell people that
on the tour...

858
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:53,472
My mind must have been elsewhere.

859
00:52:57,919 --> 00:52:59,034
Let's go!

860
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,716
I'm disappointed,
I expected better.

861
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,757
It's better than nothing.

862
00:53:13,919 --> 00:53:15,557
True, it's better than nothing.

863
00:53:17,399 --> 00:53:20,118
The other bakery
is cheaper and better.

864
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:24,995
I'm working like crazy...

865
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:28,955
Yes, it's the big day soon.
When is it exactly?

866
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,078
Friday at three.
In three days time.

867
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:35,117
You're not too anxious?

868
00:53:35,919 --> 00:53:37,955
I feel unbelievably relaxed.

869
00:53:39,559 --> 00:53:43,154
It's my sister who's all worked up.

870
00:53:45,159 --> 00:53:48,674
And my father's making
a six-hour train journey

871
00:53:48,879 --> 00:53:52,474
to hear a thesis on yeomen
in the year 1000 at Paladru Lake.

872
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,751
He'll nod off after five minutes.

873
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,274
Everyone else probably will too.

874
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:03,590
Friday at three,
I'll think of you.

875
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:07,312
You can come, if you're interested.

876
00:54:08,439 --> 00:54:10,907
I don't want to be in the way.

877
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:12,837
On the contrary, please come...

878
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:24,710
Will... your friend be there?

879
00:54:24,919 --> 00:54:26,318
Yes, of course.

880
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:27,998
Yes, of course...

881
00:54:29,279 --> 00:54:32,715
Anyway, I'll come...
Really, yes... I'm interested.

882
00:54:33,079 --> 00:54:35,229
What planet are you living on?

883
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:37,430
You drag the customer across Paris,

884
00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:40,756
then realize you forgot the keys!
What goes on in your mind?

885
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:42,916
It's just absentmindedness...

886
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:46,157
And what are
all these endless lunch-breaks?

887
00:54:46,439 --> 00:54:49,590
I repeat,
you have one hour for lunch.

888
00:54:49,799 --> 00:54:54,315
One hour isn't 90 or 105 minutes,
it's 60 minutes!

889
00:54:54,479 --> 00:54:56,197
I don't know what you do,

890
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:59,511
whether you write your radio poems
or just eat slowly,

891
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:01,232
I couldn't care less.

892
00:55:01,439 --> 00:55:03,748
But I want you back on time.

893
00:55:04,279 --> 00:55:07,988
My father gave you a free rein
but it's different now.

894
00:55:08,199 --> 00:55:09,678
True, it is different.

895
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:14,077
A boss and his employee
don't have to be

896
00:55:14,279 --> 00:55:15,871
the best of pals.

897
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,592
Just do your job.

898
00:55:17,799 --> 00:55:20,836
Sorry to interrupt
but the customer's waiting...

899
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:22,233
Go on then...

900
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:26,318
By the way,
replace me on Friday afternoon.

901
00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:27,315
Why?

902
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:29,987
"Why?"
Because I'm busy!

903
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:31,669
Not for the hell of it...

904
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:41,992
It's very big. 11,500?

905
00:55:42,199 --> 00:55:45,953
I was about to tell you.
It's a fixed rent.

906
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:47,387
Oh, right...

907
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:51,152
In 1939,
it belonged to Mr Zambo.

908
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:56,192
Did he like Mrs Zambo's place?

909
00:55:59,399 --> 00:56:03,153
I'll call you back.
If I miss the end, it'll look bad.

910
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,634
We can't have that.

911
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:09,508
I'll call you back.

912
00:56:11,999 --> 00:56:14,718
...the basis of the upheaval
of the year 1000.

913
00:56:15,279 --> 00:56:18,510
Thank you, Miss Lipmann,
remarkable. We'll let you know.

914
00:56:40,759 --> 00:56:42,158
It went well, didn't it?

915
00:56:42,359 --> 00:56:46,193
I don't know how these things
usually go

916
00:56:46,399 --> 00:56:48,515
but did you hear

917
00:56:48,679 --> 00:56:51,512
all those compliments they made?

918
00:56:51,719 --> 00:56:55,553
That little fellow:
"A considerable mass of work..."

919
00:56:55,759 --> 00:56:58,876
"Exceptional" and all that.

920
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:02,275
How did you feel about it?

921
00:57:02,479 --> 00:57:04,788
You really impressed me, you know.

922
00:57:04,959 --> 00:57:07,314
Such determination
and self-assurance...

923
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:09,714
You astounded me, all right.

924
00:57:09,879 --> 00:57:11,153
Well done, my dear.

925
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:12,678
Wait for the results...

926
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,757
Let me have a go too, dad.

927
00:57:16,519 --> 00:57:17,998
Silly...

928
00:57:18,199 --> 00:57:19,917
It's nerves...

929
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:21,957
I was so tense, I think

930
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:24,070
I was more scared than you.

931
00:57:24,919 --> 00:57:26,796
What a relief!

932
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:31,274
Give me your hand and take mine

933
00:57:31,479 --> 00:57:34,949
The bell has rung without a doubt

934
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:38,674
The street is ours, oh so fine

935
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,316
Yes, yes, school is out

936
00:57:43,319 --> 00:57:45,992
I could have killed one!
The fool was reading.

937
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:49,077
You were talking
and he just sat there reading!

938
00:57:49,239 --> 00:57:50,513
Did you see him?

939
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:51,993
It was scandalous.

940
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,350
Well done.

941
00:57:56,199 --> 00:57:59,111
He shouldn't have a say.
He didn't even listen.

942
00:57:59,319 --> 00:58:02,994
You ought to file a complaint
right now.

943
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:05,110
- What is it?
- Exhaustion?

944
00:58:05,319 --> 00:58:07,037
I don't feel well.

945
00:58:07,239 --> 00:58:08,433
She's just tired...

946
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:09,867
She wouldn't eat.

947
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:13,276
That's why I offered her
this banana earlier!

948
00:58:13,639 --> 00:58:14,549
Really...

949
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:16,109
Here...

950
00:58:18,519 --> 00:58:20,874
Be a good girl, eat this.

951
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:23,829
Your blood sugar's down,
it's normal!

952
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:26,514
She should have eaten
pasta last night.

953
00:58:26,679 --> 00:58:28,431
That's what athletes do.

954
00:58:31,319 --> 00:58:32,274
Water...

955
00:58:32,839 --> 00:58:34,192
Water?

956
00:58:35,759 --> 00:58:36,908
Water!

957
00:58:39,759 --> 00:58:41,033
Don't you want to eat?

958
00:58:41,319 --> 00:58:43,116
Have a little bit more.

959
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:50,833
Could someone call a doctor?

960
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:54,190
My hips do the dips

961
00:58:54,399 --> 00:58:56,435
My belly has turned to jelly

962
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:58,789
My chest is not at its best

963
00:58:58,999 --> 00:59:01,035
My back has gone all slack

964
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:03,315
My sternum is all bunkum

965
00:59:03,519 --> 00:59:06,317
My navel is all a-wobble

966
00:59:11,439 --> 00:59:12,952
What about magnesium?

967
00:59:13,919 --> 00:59:16,672
You can try it.
I'll prescribe you some.

968
00:59:16,879 --> 00:59:19,996
There again, magnesium settles
or it doesn't.

969
00:59:20,199 --> 00:59:21,837
We don't know much about it.

970
00:59:22,039 --> 00:59:25,714
Two tests a few days apart
can give totally different results.

971
00:59:25,919 --> 00:59:28,149
What do you expect me to tell you?

972
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:33,518
What about my low blood pressure?

973
00:59:33,719 --> 00:59:35,550
True, it is a bit low

974
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:40,314
but it could rise again
in the next ten minutes.

975
00:59:41,159 --> 00:59:44,276
Basically, I came too soon.
In an hour, I'd be healthy.

976
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:46,757
Exactly.

977
00:59:46,959 --> 00:59:48,870
I'll give you some vitamins.

978
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:52,788
Yes, a bit of magnesium too...

979
00:59:52,999 --> 00:59:54,671
It won't do any harm.

980
00:59:55,879 --> 00:59:57,835
Have you been vaccinated
for hepatitis B?

981
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:01,315
Ah. Tiredness and all that...

982
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:03,874
We'll do a test just to check.

983
01:00:04,999 --> 01:00:07,877
Hepatitis B...
Hepatitis B is terrible!

984
01:00:08,519 --> 01:00:11,955
It's all or nothing.
You might simply have jaundice

985
01:00:12,519 --> 01:00:16,068
or go the whole hog...
Cirrhosis, cancer and the works.

986
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,076
Hepatitis B is a lottery.

987
01:00:19,719 --> 01:00:22,472
I'm ill

988
01:00:23,239 --> 01:00:26,515
Totally ill

989
01:00:27,159 --> 01:00:30,595
Like when mother went out at night

990
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:35,554
And left me alone with my plight

991
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:39,876
How's life in general?
Everything okay, no worries?

992
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:42,397
Perfect... life in general...

993
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:46,468
If you remember,
last time I saw you

994
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:50,194
you gave me Stimusil
for two or three weeks.

995
01:00:50,399 --> 01:00:52,117
It did me a lot of good.

996
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:53,547
Did that work?

997
01:00:53,879 --> 01:00:54,789
I'll give you some.

998
01:00:54,999 --> 01:00:58,389
Careful with Glytanose.
There can be side-effects.

999
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,749
Not always but...

1000
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:01,638
It happens.

1001
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:04,228
If so, stop it right away.

1002
01:01:04,439 --> 01:01:06,077
What kind of side-effects?

1003
01:01:06,279 --> 01:01:09,396
Rashes, hot flushes, itching.

1004
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,194
I always have hot flushes,
rashes and itching.

1005
01:01:13,999 --> 01:01:16,035
No Glytanose then.

1006
01:01:19,439 --> 01:01:21,031
It's happening again.

1007
01:01:23,199 --> 01:01:25,474
My chest hurts, I can't breathe...

1008
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:28,752
How about tuberculosis?
Is that ridiculous?

1009
01:01:29,439 --> 01:01:30,554
Ridiculous!

1010
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:32,429
No.

1011
01:01:33,159 --> 01:01:34,478
No regrets.

1012
01:01:35,799 --> 01:01:37,471
Yes, I have no regrets.

1013
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:40,994
We had to part, so we parted but...

1014
01:01:42,479 --> 01:01:44,276
you end up on your own.

1015
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:48,512
You're there,
shut up alone in your flat...

1016
01:01:49,519 --> 01:01:52,829
Sometimes, you feel okay
for a while...

1017
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:54,553
But then...

1018
01:01:55,559 --> 01:01:58,073
it takes the slightest thing...

1019
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:05,638
When I see that couple
over there, say, it hurts...

1020
01:02:07,559 --> 01:02:10,198
I see people in love,
sharing things...

1021
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:11,076
Has it gone?

1022
01:02:11,239 --> 01:02:12,911
No! Is it biro or what?

1023
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:14,154
I don't know.

1024
01:02:14,359 --> 01:02:17,476
She had a full check-up,
there's nothing wrong.

1025
01:02:17,679 --> 01:02:19,874
It's just exhaustion,
the repercussions...

1026
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:21,512
She'll get over it.

1027
01:02:21,719 --> 01:02:24,995
The doctor told her
she has panic disorder.

1028
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:28,111
It's just nerves,
nothing serious...

1029
01:02:28,359 --> 01:02:29,838
Cheese or dessert?

1030
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:33,076
Just think,
a unanimous commendation...

1031
01:02:33,279 --> 01:02:34,029
I knew it.

1032
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:36,594
That's not what I'm saying!
Unanimous!

1033
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,914
Yes, right...

1034
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:40,832
Marc was there with his flowers...
He's so sweet.

1035
01:02:40,999 --> 01:02:44,674
We sign for the apartment
on Tuesday. It's final now.

1036
01:02:44,999 --> 01:02:45,715
Tuesday?

1037
01:02:45,919 --> 01:02:47,557
I bet you'd forgotten.

1038
01:02:48,999 --> 01:02:50,398
You're reluctant.

1039
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:53,153
I'll have cheese to finish the wine.
Want some?

1040
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:57,034
Not a whole helping.
Get a bit of goat's cheese for me.

1041
01:02:57,919 --> 01:02:58,829
Goat's cheese...

1042
01:03:01,239 --> 01:03:02,467
Excuse me...

1043
01:03:07,799 --> 01:03:09,915
The cheese-board, please.

1044
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,348
One cheese-board...

1045
01:03:11,959 --> 01:03:13,870
- Madame?
- Nothing, thank you.

1046
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:26,676
A bit of camembert...

1047
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:29,912
A bit of...

1048
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:31,833
Munster!

1049
01:03:33,079 --> 01:03:34,671
And some goat's cheese.

1050
01:03:36,039 --> 01:03:39,475
There's no goat's cheese, sir,
I'm sorry.

1051
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:43,315
What do you want?

1052
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:45,952
What do I want?

1053
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:49,956
- There's no goat's cheese.
- I'm not having cheese.

1054
01:03:53,159 --> 01:03:56,151
Nothing then... No need...
Just the bill.

1055
01:03:57,519 --> 01:03:58,395
That's all.

1056
01:04:05,519 --> 01:04:07,635
- I don't understand.
- No, you don't.

1057
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:16,436
I don't have a girlfriend

1058
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,867
I can talk to...

1059
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:25,555
Until the time when the monarchy
became sedentary,

1060
01:04:26,039 --> 01:04:27,438
under Louis XIV,

1061
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:30,673
tables, chairs, beds...

1062
01:04:31,159 --> 01:04:33,434
were all carried
from place to place,

1063
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:35,873
mobile furnishings...

1064
01:04:38,279 --> 01:04:39,712
On this very bed,

1065
01:04:40,639 --> 01:04:44,188
where the regent entertained
half the ladies in the court,

1066
01:04:44,399 --> 01:04:45,912
his wife...

1067
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:50,038
had her final...

1068
01:04:51,479 --> 01:04:53,276
fatal illness...

1069
01:04:56,519 --> 01:04:59,352
We'll stop now.
Sorry, I don't feel well...

1070
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:02,313
We'll stop. It's over.

1071
01:05:05,759 --> 01:05:06,555
Camille!

1072
01:05:07,279 --> 01:05:08,268
What's wrong?

1073
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,318
She's ill. Can't you see?

1074
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:15,036
Tell them the tour's over.

1075
01:05:15,639 --> 01:05:19,109
The tour's over now,
thank you very much!

1076
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:25,108
Are you all right?

1077
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:33,711
Sorry.

1078
01:05:35,199 --> 01:05:36,427
I'm going to throw up.

1079
01:05:36,919 --> 01:05:38,557
I shouldn't have, sorry...

1080
01:05:39,079 --> 01:05:40,273
I don't know why I...

1081
01:05:40,479 --> 01:05:44,518
I'm sick of it. It keeps happening.
I'm so scared...

1082
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:46,154
I can't go on...

1083
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,750
What are you talking about?

1084
01:05:48,959 --> 01:05:50,233
Bravo for your thesis...

1085
01:05:50,439 --> 01:05:52,555
I don't give a damn about that.

1086
01:05:52,879 --> 01:05:56,235
I can't work or go out...
I'm scared to go shopping.

1087
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:57,948
I can't take any more.

1088
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:02,958
Shouldn't you go home and rest?

1089
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:07,791
No, I'm meeting someone
at the museum café.

1090
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:12,514
I'll come with you, okay?

1091
01:06:29,679 --> 01:06:31,874
Apparently,
panic disorder is fairly common.

1092
01:06:34,039 --> 01:06:36,507
It happened the day of your viva.
That's odd...

1093
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:43,796
I'm no doctor but you might be
a bit depressed, say.

1094
01:06:44,519 --> 01:06:46,874
Not at all! Depressed?

1095
01:06:47,399 --> 01:06:50,391
Quite the opposite,
I've never been happier!

1096
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:52,151
I have everything I want.

1097
01:06:52,959 --> 01:06:54,836
I have no problems...

1098
01:06:57,159 --> 01:06:59,115
What a funny idea! Depressed...

1099
01:06:59,279 --> 01:07:00,553
Why do you say that?

1100
01:07:01,159 --> 01:07:02,797
It's not an insult...

1101
01:07:02,999 --> 01:07:05,433
Of course not but it's so...

1102
01:07:09,279 --> 01:07:10,951
What does your friend think?

1103
01:07:11,479 --> 01:07:13,276
He says it's nothing.

1104
01:07:13,479 --> 01:07:15,276
He stays calm. He's kind.

1105
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:24,347
I'd better get to work.
My boss is anything but kind.

1106
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:34,232
What are you doing here?

1107
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:38,352
I'm with a friend...
What do you mean?

1108
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:39,634
You know Simon?

1109
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:42,307
Yes, he works for me at the agency.

1110
01:07:45,559 --> 01:07:46,628
That's why I'm surprised.

1111
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:48,592
He works for you?

1112
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:51,190
You don't write radio plays?

1113
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:53,674
Is he your...

1114
01:07:54,399 --> 01:07:56,993
You don't write radio plays?

1115
01:07:57,199 --> 01:07:59,155
And I also work for your...

1116
01:08:01,479 --> 01:08:03,231
I'll be going now.

1117
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:12,190
The plays don't pay well,
so I have to...

1118
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:16,237
I never told you
because I never had the chance.

1119
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,548
Do you know him well?

1120
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:25,195
So, so...

1121
01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:27,990
He's quite a character.

1122
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,558
What's wrong? You're pale.

1123
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:34,632
One of those turns?

1124
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:36,908
Want a sugar-lump?

1125
01:08:40,519 --> 01:08:43,989
So, my employee
arrives half an hour late

1126
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:47,795
every other afternoon
because he's "chatting" with you...

1127
01:08:48,679 --> 01:08:50,715
You're corrupting my staff.

1128
01:08:51,719 --> 01:08:53,516
Do you have that much
to talk about?

1129
01:08:53,799 --> 01:08:55,198
I don't know...

1130
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,990
We like talking together.

1131
01:08:58,199 --> 01:09:00,110
About history, I suppose.

1132
01:09:03,479 --> 01:09:05,117
One day, I told him:

1133
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:09,432
"You know, Simon,
not only do you write plays...

1134
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,475
"you play at selling
real estate too! "

1135
01:09:18,999 --> 01:09:21,877
She isn't dead set
against estate agents...

1136
01:09:22,759 --> 01:09:25,831
It was like a nightmare.
Everything was so...

1137
01:09:26,559 --> 01:09:28,311
absurd, incoherent... cold!

1138
01:09:28,519 --> 01:09:29,634
Yes, I was cold.

1139
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:34,352
If people had pointed and laughed,
I wouldn't have been surprised.

1140
01:09:34,559 --> 01:09:35,787
I can imagine.

1141
01:09:35,999 --> 01:09:37,990
I left the café in a daze.

1142
01:09:38,199 --> 01:09:41,032
Camille with Marc Duveyrier,
it's ridiculous...

1143
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:43,712
They have nothing in common.

1144
01:09:43,919 --> 01:09:47,150
He has cretinous interests,
he's dishonest...

1145
01:09:47,559 --> 01:09:50,835
But I can't tell her that.
I'd look ridiculous.

1146
01:09:52,999 --> 01:09:55,672
It would look
like bitterness or spite...

1147
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:59,150
Still, there are worse things...

1148
01:09:59,319 --> 01:10:00,957
war, famine, unemployment...

1149
01:10:01,159 --> 01:10:02,797
Yes, of course...

1150
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:04,959
Think of something else.

1151
01:10:05,759 --> 01:10:07,511
With time

1152
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:12,956
With time, everything fades

1153
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:18,274
You forget the face
You forget the voice

1154
01:10:18,799 --> 01:10:21,836
The heart that no longer beats

1155
01:10:22,039 --> 01:10:26,157
There's no need to keep looking

1156
01:10:26,359 --> 01:10:29,795
Let it fade, that's the right thing

1157
01:10:32,079 --> 01:10:35,435
A good friend

1158
01:10:35,639 --> 01:10:39,029
There's nothing better around

1159
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:42,631
Yes, a good friend

1160
01:10:42,839 --> 01:10:46,514
Is more loyal than a pretty blonde

1161
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:50,234
You spend, you lend, you mend

1162
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:53,677
Living every second

1163
01:10:53,879 --> 01:10:57,076
Troubles soon end

1164
01:10:57,359 --> 01:11:00,476
When you have a good friend

1165
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:07,427
This one's nice, isn't it?

1166
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,990
It's quiet...

1167
01:11:12,199 --> 01:11:13,188
It's bright...

1168
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,552
The price is reasonable...

1169
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:20,678
So, we could say...

1170
01:11:20,879 --> 01:11:23,677
Yes, it's nice,
I can't deny that...

1171
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:26,638
It's nice, very nice.

1172
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:28,357
But?

1173
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,438
But, but...

1174
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:38,873
It's too big.

1175
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,471
There, it's too big.

1176
01:11:44,359 --> 01:11:46,748
Maybe it's the state I'm in but...
to be honest...

1177
01:11:46,919 --> 01:11:49,592
I'm a bit disheartened.
You understand?

1178
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,514
My wife and children
might not be coming.

1179
01:11:55,359 --> 01:11:57,111
- Really?
- No, I'm not sure.

1180
01:11:57,879 --> 01:11:58,948
Why?

1181
01:11:59,159 --> 01:12:01,753
Sorry, that's none of my business...

1182
01:12:01,959 --> 01:12:04,154
No, no, it's all right.

1183
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:09,238
There isn't a problem,
everything's fine...

1184
01:12:11,919 --> 01:12:15,275
It's just...
I spoke to my wife on the phone

1185
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:16,595
two days ago

1186
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:20,838
and she told me, quite reasonably,
that until I get things sorted out...

1187
01:12:21,039 --> 01:12:22,916
There's a lot to set up,

1188
01:12:23,519 --> 01:12:25,828
it takes time,
I can hardly manage...

1189
01:12:27,519 --> 01:12:28,634
And so...

1190
01:12:29,519 --> 01:12:32,317
until that's done,
it's a bit stupid

1191
01:12:32,519 --> 01:12:35,716
for her to come over
with the children and all...

1192
01:12:36,759 --> 01:12:38,795
See? It's a bit stupid.

1193
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:42,236
How about studio flats?

1194
01:12:43,479 --> 01:12:44,275
Do you rent those?

1195
01:12:44,679 --> 01:12:45,714
Studio flats?

1196
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:52,909
So?

1197
01:12:54,559 --> 01:12:58,916
Will our love become
a diamond in the rust?

1198
01:13:01,039 --> 01:13:02,313
I want

1199
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,957
The world to stop, I know it must

1200
01:13:09,839 --> 01:13:10,749
You,

1201
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:17,759
Would rather die than turn to dust

1202
01:13:18,599 --> 01:13:24,629
Whatever happened to our trust?

1203
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,916
I'm seeing my doctor in...

1204
01:13:29,719 --> 01:13:31,311
three minutes, I'm late.

1205
01:13:31,719 --> 01:13:32,469
Are you ill?

1206
01:13:32,679 --> 01:13:35,273
No, everything's fine,
that's not the problem.

1207
01:13:37,759 --> 01:13:40,831
Lord, what a bother
Always feeling peaky

1208
01:13:41,039 --> 01:13:42,597
I'm not well.

1209
01:13:44,839 --> 01:13:45,908
What should I do?

1210
01:13:50,679 --> 01:13:52,351
For now, nothing.

1211
01:13:53,239 --> 01:13:54,149
Meaning?

1212
01:13:54,359 --> 01:13:56,475
First, no more Néparil,
that's my advice.

1213
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:00,313
It's crazy to prescribe it.

1214
01:14:01,919 --> 01:14:03,955
I don't know how anyone can...

1215
01:14:10,039 --> 01:14:12,951
Perhaps he's a good doctor but...

1216
01:14:13,279 --> 01:14:14,712
He advised me to...

1217
01:14:14,919 --> 01:14:16,830
When you stop the treatment...

1218
01:14:21,119 --> 01:14:23,269
Let me explain, it's simple.

1219
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,839
When you stop,

1220
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:28,594
your immune system weakens

1221
01:14:29,239 --> 01:14:31,992
and so obviously
the first bug around...

1222
01:14:33,959 --> 01:14:34,948
is for you.

1223
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:41,717
How can I tell who...

1224
01:14:41,919 --> 01:14:44,638
If you want
a friendly word of advice,

1225
01:14:45,919 --> 01:14:47,750
take your box of Néparil

1226
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:49,959
and throw it in the bin.

1227
01:14:53,959 --> 01:14:56,314
You're not happy?
They're publishing it.

1228
01:14:56,519 --> 01:14:58,589
No one cares about yeomen.

1229
01:14:58,759 --> 01:15:00,795
As for Paladru Lake, forget it!

1230
01:15:01,519 --> 01:15:04,670
Seven years on something
of interest to fifteen people!

1231
01:15:04,879 --> 01:15:07,347
You disappoint me.
Sorry, but you disappoint me.

1232
01:15:09,759 --> 01:15:11,989
I'd be very upset if you gave up.

1233
01:15:12,199 --> 01:15:13,427
And father too!

1234
01:15:14,599 --> 01:15:15,475
I'm sorry...

1235
01:15:16,039 --> 01:15:19,395
I'll be frank,
you're too self-pitying...

1236
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:22,195
Don't let yourself go.

1237
01:15:23,719 --> 01:15:27,792
It depends on you!
You have to react and tell yourself:

1238
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:28,910
"I'm fine now,

1239
01:15:29,119 --> 01:15:32,270
"perfectly healthy, I'm happy,
I'll think positive! "

1240
01:15:32,439 --> 01:15:35,988
Convince yourself of that,
things will soon get better!

1241
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:38,478
Don't get down like this.

1242
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:40,999
I'm surprised.

1243
01:15:41,759 --> 01:15:44,557
Usually you're so active
and determined!

1244
01:15:45,959 --> 01:15:49,429
Other people have
a thousand reasons to be unhappy.

1245
01:15:49,639 --> 01:15:51,470
Oh, great!

1246
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:53,790
They're strong and brave
and I'm not!

1247
01:15:56,079 --> 01:15:59,037
I'm unhappy for no reason
and that makes me even unhappier!

1248
01:15:59,559 --> 01:16:00,708
Resist!

1249
01:16:02,359 --> 01:16:04,827
Show the world you exist!

1250
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:08,707
Look for joy everywhere

1251
01:16:09,119 --> 01:16:12,748
Yes, spurn every egoist

1252
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:16,709
Resist!

1253
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:28,035
She's in such a state...

1254
01:16:29,079 --> 01:16:31,149
She has to pull herself together.

1255
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:32,838
Don't you agree?

1256
01:16:33,719 --> 01:16:36,756
She needs rest,
she's already a little better.

1257
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:38,314
Excuse me...

1258
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:36,917
I hate seeing her like that.

1259
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:40,077
All those pills she takes
for one thing or another.

1260
01:17:42,279 --> 01:17:43,997
I never take medication.

1261
01:17:44,199 --> 01:17:46,667
Me too,
just an aspirin occasionally.

1262
01:17:46,839 --> 01:17:49,592
I've had maybe one aspirin
in the last ten years.

1263
01:17:50,359 --> 01:17:51,508
What about headaches?

1264
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:54,996
I never have headaches!
I don't know what a headache is.

1265
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:56,837
I'm against tablets.

1266
01:17:59,839 --> 01:18:01,352
You've made a good deal.

1267
01:18:02,439 --> 01:18:04,589
- I'm pleased.
- You should be.

1268
01:18:05,359 --> 01:18:06,758
I can't wait to move in.

1269
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:08,758
I'll throw a party...

1270
01:18:08,919 --> 01:18:11,114
You must have
a house-warming party.

1271
01:18:11,319 --> 01:18:13,674
Have some fun

1272
01:18:14,119 --> 01:18:16,314
Go on the run

1273
01:18:16,519 --> 01:18:20,478
Life can be so short

1274
01:18:20,999 --> 01:18:25,277
Have some fun
Don't be outdone

1275
01:18:25,479 --> 01:18:29,074
Life is so short after all

1276
01:18:33,599 --> 01:18:34,315
Okay?

1277
01:18:37,719 --> 01:18:38,788
I feel a bit nauseous.

1278
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:40,070
Want a sugar-lump?

1279
01:18:40,279 --> 01:18:43,988
Another sugar lump? Why?
It's not hypoglycaemia!

1280
01:18:44,839 --> 01:18:46,033
Forget the sugar!

1281
01:18:48,119 --> 01:18:52,749
You sit and wonder how to react

1282
01:18:53,239 --> 01:18:58,154
To make the least impact

1283
01:18:58,759 --> 01:19:02,308
Whatever you do, it's always wrong

1284
01:19:02,519 --> 01:19:04,555
You never react as you should

1285
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:31,750
Look!

1286
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:33,275
Look, Camille!

1287
01:19:33,479 --> 01:19:34,275
What?

1288
01:19:35,239 --> 01:19:36,911
My God...
That's not his wife!

1289
01:19:39,439 --> 01:19:40,633
Do you realize?

1290
01:19:41,199 --> 01:19:42,678
I'm not surprised.

1291
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,472
Neither am I but even so!

1292
01:19:48,439 --> 01:19:51,795
He had the nerve to say
that he's never unfaithful now!

1293
01:19:54,679 --> 01:19:56,988
Eyes all ablaze

1294
01:19:57,279 --> 01:20:00,191
Boys have just one craze

1295
01:20:01,159 --> 01:20:04,834
For a losing game
Looking under

1296
01:20:05,559 --> 01:20:06,674
girls'skirts

1297
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,749
They spend all their time

1298
01:20:10,319 --> 01:20:12,879
From their youth to their prime

1299
01:20:14,039 --> 01:20:16,155
On a losing game

1300
01:20:16,799 --> 01:20:19,359
Looking under girls'skirts

1301
01:20:24,839 --> 01:20:27,034
I saw you with a woman in a car.

1302
01:20:27,839 --> 01:20:28,396
Me?

1303
01:20:28,599 --> 01:20:31,750
Of course not, your spitting image.
I said to myself:

1304
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:35,509
"He looks just like Claude! "

1305
01:20:36,119 --> 01:20:38,349
That's funny.

1306
01:20:38,679 --> 01:20:40,795
I'd just seen Nicolas
with his mistress...

1307
01:20:42,199 --> 01:20:43,393
I was still in shock.

1308
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:46,189
I saw lovers and mistresses
everywhere after that.

1309
01:20:48,479 --> 01:20:51,277
How many doubles do we have?
Seven?

1310
01:20:52,399 --> 01:20:54,629
Seven? I don't know...

1311
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:11,917
Filthy weather...

1312
01:21:12,519 --> 01:21:15,317
I like it.
The wind, the cold, you know that.

1313
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:20,591
You didn't answer, Nicolas...

1314
01:21:21,519 --> 01:21:22,713
I didn't answer what?

1315
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:25,351
You haven't got anywhere.

1316
01:21:25,559 --> 01:21:28,756
I've told you,
we're not going over it again!

1317
01:21:28,959 --> 01:21:32,269
You've told me nothing,
it keeps changing!

1318
01:21:32,439 --> 01:21:33,952
Here we go...

1319
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:37,317
Let's talk it over calmly.

1320
01:21:38,439 --> 01:21:40,953
Have you heard about the job?

1321
01:21:41,319 --> 01:21:42,638
Have you found a flat?

1322
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:44,319
Think I want to reply

1323
01:21:44,919 --> 01:21:47,672
when you talk to me
like I'm a schoolkid?

1324
01:21:47,839 --> 01:21:49,318
You make me.

1325
01:21:50,599 --> 01:21:54,353
If you're here to tell me
I don't do things right,

1326
01:21:54,519 --> 01:21:56,077
it wasn't worth coming!

1327
01:21:57,279 --> 01:22:00,271
If you're here to tell me
what you hate about me,

1328
01:22:00,479 --> 01:22:01,548
I already know!

1329
01:22:01,799 --> 01:22:03,278
I don't hate anything about you...

1330
01:22:03,879 --> 01:22:05,949
I'm doing what I can on my own.

1331
01:22:08,559 --> 01:22:10,311
It takes time, you know.

1332
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:13,592
I know that, I'm not stupid!

1333
01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:16,832
But please stop lying to me.

1334
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:19,633
You keep telling me it's sorted out,

1335
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,512
that things are almost ready...

1336
01:22:21,879 --> 01:22:23,790
Just stop lying to me.

1337
01:22:25,919 --> 01:22:27,989
I don't hate you, Nicolas.

1338
01:22:29,399 --> 01:22:30,991
Listen to me...

1339
01:22:33,639 --> 01:22:35,914
Why do you need
to convince people

1340
01:22:36,919 --> 01:22:39,433
that you're in control,
that everything's fine?

1341
01:22:40,839 --> 01:22:42,318
Why don't you say:

1342
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:43,992
"I'm not up to it.

1343
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:45,519
"It's not working out."

1344
01:22:46,439 --> 01:22:47,394
Tell me.

1345
01:22:48,839 --> 01:22:51,751
I prefer to hear the truth.

1346
01:22:51,959 --> 01:22:54,189
Stop it.
I'd tell you if it wasn't okay.

1347
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:56,439
If I believed you

1348
01:22:57,039 --> 01:22:59,314
when you say it's all arranged,

1349
01:22:59,919 --> 01:23:02,752
I'd turn up here in Paris,
with the kids and bags.

1350
01:23:02,959 --> 01:23:04,517
And then what?

1351
01:23:04,919 --> 01:23:05,908
How can I count on you?

1352
01:23:06,119 --> 01:23:09,395
Sure, don't count on me!
I'm not the reliable type.

1353
01:23:10,119 --> 01:23:11,438
Stop it, Nicolas.

1354
01:23:13,759 --> 01:23:15,317
Know what the trouble is?

1355
01:23:15,519 --> 01:23:17,987
You'd like me to be different...
Someone else...

1356
01:23:18,199 --> 01:23:19,393
That's the problem.

1357
01:23:21,519 --> 01:23:23,714
Well, too bad!
I am who I am and that's it.

1358
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:26,552
If you can't take that...

1359
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,714
Is that it?

1360
01:23:32,919 --> 01:23:35,114
Yes, that's all.
The wrong attitude again?

1361
01:23:36,319 --> 01:23:37,195
So?

1362
01:23:38,959 --> 01:23:43,396
Will our love become
a diamond in the rust?

1363
01:23:45,439 --> 01:23:46,428
I want

1364
01:23:47,919 --> 01:23:52,276
The world to stop, I know it must

1365
01:23:54,199 --> 01:23:55,109
You,

1366
01:23:57,039 --> 01:24:02,272
Would rather die than turn to dust

1367
01:24:02,919 --> 01:24:06,798
Whatever happened

1368
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:09,789
to our trust?

1369
01:24:10,679 --> 01:24:11,998
I'm going back.

1370
01:24:12,199 --> 01:24:14,269
I'll get the next train.

1371
01:24:14,479 --> 01:24:15,832
I can't stay here.

1372
01:24:16,799 --> 01:24:20,508
Thank Odile for the invitation
but I don't want to go.

1373
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:23,508
You tell her...
whatever you like.

1374
01:24:23,919 --> 01:24:26,717
I can count on you for that.

1375
01:24:29,639 --> 01:24:32,073
That was the final shot, you know

1376
01:24:32,439 --> 01:24:34,828
In the last picture show

1377
01:24:35,359 --> 01:24:39,796
And the curtain falls
over the screen

1378
01:24:50,999 --> 01:24:52,671
I'd have loved to come.

1379
01:24:53,639 --> 01:24:54,594
I don't want to.

1380
01:24:56,519 --> 01:24:57,190
Why?

1381
01:24:59,559 --> 01:25:00,594
You don't know?

1382
01:25:04,559 --> 01:25:05,787
I'd feel uncomfortable.

1383
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,313
Pity, I'd have liked that.

1384
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:09,958
Liked what?

1385
01:25:12,679 --> 01:25:13,998
Seeing you there.

1386
01:25:15,439 --> 01:25:16,394
Seeing you there!

1387
01:25:16,999 --> 01:25:17,954
But why?

1388
01:25:19,039 --> 01:25:19,869
Why?

1389
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:23,590
I don't know...
because we're friends.

1390
01:25:23,879 --> 01:25:25,278
I don't want us to be friends.

1391
01:25:27,079 --> 01:25:29,673
That's stupid,
that's not what I meant exactly.

1392
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:33,758
But there you are...

1393
01:25:34,359 --> 01:25:35,428
I won't be coming.

1394
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:55,991
I'm going to be the prettiest
At the dance tonight

1395
01:25:57,559 --> 01:25:58,753
Tonight

1396
01:25:59,479 --> 01:26:01,037
Just to show

1397
01:26:01,239 --> 01:26:03,434
that I'm the best
And perhaps I might

1398
01:26:05,279 --> 01:26:06,507
I might

1399
01:26:07,359 --> 01:26:11,147
Tonight, I'll be the sweetest
When you come to me

1400
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:14,633
To me

1401
01:26:15,319 --> 01:26:17,071
And say the words I request

1402
01:26:17,279 --> 01:26:19,076
Those words of love, you see

1403
01:26:20,799 --> 01:26:21,993
You see

1404
01:27:10,759 --> 01:27:13,512
What's that all the way...

1405
01:27:14,079 --> 01:27:14,989
over there?

1406
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:17,316
I was wondering myself...

1407
01:27:17,519 --> 01:27:18,668
Is it the Panthéon?

1408
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:20,996
Good Lord, no! The Panthéon!

1409
01:27:22,879 --> 01:27:24,756
It's the trade union centre...

1410
01:27:28,079 --> 01:27:31,549
I like the girls you see in Elle

1411
01:27:31,919 --> 01:27:35,309
I like the girls in magazines

1412
01:27:36,079 --> 01:27:38,195
The amazing thing about them

1413
01:27:38,399 --> 01:27:40,549
is their serenity and independence.

1414
01:27:40,759 --> 01:27:41,953
We can learn from them.

1415
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:45,436
They'd teach us a thing or two,
if only we listened.

1416
01:27:45,639 --> 01:27:48,153
And they're so intelligent!
Right, Camille?

1417
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:50,634
Dolphins...

1418
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:56,633
How does she do it?

1419
01:27:56,839 --> 01:27:59,307
It must have cost her a fortune.

1420
01:28:00,559 --> 01:28:02,789
I don't think so...
I don't know.

1421
01:28:04,359 --> 01:28:06,111
Are you a friend of Odile's?

1422
01:28:07,039 --> 01:28:08,916
No. Of Camille's. Her sister.

1423
01:28:10,199 --> 01:28:12,030
So you're the estate agent!

1424
01:28:13,359 --> 01:28:14,838
No, that's him, there.

1425
01:28:16,799 --> 01:28:17,914
Oh, I see...

1426
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:22,277
So you're a friend of...

1427
01:28:23,599 --> 01:28:24,429
Odile.

1428
01:28:24,879 --> 01:28:27,951
I'm one of her colleagues
from work.

1429
01:28:28,159 --> 01:28:30,514
Just a notch above her but well...

1430
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:33,190
that doesn't matter, we get on well.

1431
01:28:34,519 --> 01:28:36,475
A notch above, though...

1432
01:28:40,359 --> 01:28:41,678
What do you do?

1433
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:44,472
I write plays for the radio.

1434
01:28:46,799 --> 01:28:49,188
There's no such thing now!
I mean,

1435
01:28:49,399 --> 01:28:53,358
I thought they stopped years ago.
Do people still do radio plays?

1436
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:56,716
No, no, I was just joking.

1437
01:28:58,159 --> 01:28:59,797
I'm an estate agent, in fact.

1438
01:29:02,559 --> 01:29:04,231
You're stringing me along.

1439
01:29:04,479 --> 01:29:07,198
That's a big part
of an estate agent's work.

1440
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:20,191
I've come to tell you I'm going away

1441
01:29:23,119 --> 01:29:26,031
Your tears won't put it off
another day

1442
01:29:27,039 --> 01:29:29,394
Do you like raisins in taboulé?

1443
01:29:30,799 --> 01:29:31,515
Oh God...

1444
01:29:31,719 --> 01:29:33,835
They make it heavy, I find.

1445
01:29:34,519 --> 01:29:36,350
What am I doing here?

1446
01:29:36,559 --> 01:29:38,914
If I leave now, I'll look like...

1447
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:40,439
You don't know anyone...

1448
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:43,073
No, I feel really uncomfortable.

1449
01:29:43,919 --> 01:29:45,989
- Why did you come?
- I didn't want to.

1450
01:29:46,879 --> 01:29:47,675
But I came.

1451
01:29:48,679 --> 01:29:49,828
Oh, right...

1452
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,391
It's not simple, is it?

1453
01:29:52,919 --> 01:29:54,034
Anything but.

1454
01:29:55,759 --> 01:29:57,317
Eat something, like me.

1455
01:29:57,519 --> 01:29:58,838
It keeps you busy,

1456
01:29:59,039 --> 01:30:01,758
it makes you look unconcerned.

1457
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:05,030
I eat all the time at parties.

1458
01:30:06,959 --> 01:30:07,914
I'll eat then.

1459
01:30:10,479 --> 01:30:13,789
This flat is gigantic.

1460
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:16,477
How come it was so cheap?

1461
01:30:16,679 --> 01:30:19,557
I'm telling you,
it was a real bargain.

1462
01:30:20,319 --> 01:30:22,150
We had to decide fast.

1463
01:30:22,359 --> 01:30:23,792
Claude didn't understand.

1464
01:30:23,999 --> 01:30:25,193
Where is he?

1465
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:27,394
What's he doing?

1466
01:30:28,359 --> 01:30:29,155
Is he at work?

1467
01:30:29,839 --> 01:30:30,908
I suppose so.

1468
01:30:31,119 --> 01:30:32,950
I've come to tell you
I'm going away.

1469
01:30:33,519 --> 01:30:35,669
All your sobbing
won't make me stay.

1470
01:30:44,759 --> 01:30:46,829
I'm on the horns of a dilemma.

1471
01:30:47,079 --> 01:30:47,909
Meaning?

1472
01:30:48,119 --> 01:30:49,677
This flat here...

1473
01:30:51,399 --> 01:30:52,229
I know it.

1474
01:30:52,399 --> 01:30:54,276
Really? Fine...

1475
01:30:54,439 --> 01:30:55,269
What's the dilemma?

1476
01:30:55,479 --> 01:30:58,551
Bloody dolphins...
What are you talking about?

1477
01:30:58,759 --> 01:31:00,431
Apartments and...

1478
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,273
Have you found a place?

1479
01:31:03,479 --> 01:31:06,437
No, but we haven't seen many yet.

1480
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:08,038
Thirty or so...

1481
01:31:08,679 --> 01:31:09,350
Thirty?

1482
01:31:09,559 --> 01:31:10,594
At least.

1483
01:31:12,759 --> 01:31:14,511
We've seen quite a few then...

1484
01:31:15,599 --> 01:31:18,909
A good friend

1485
01:31:19,119 --> 01:31:22,589
There's nothing better around

1486
01:31:23,239 --> 01:31:26,914
I'd love to congratulate you
but I'm scared you might yell at me.

1487
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:34,710
He takes endless lunch-breaks,

1488
01:31:34,919 --> 01:31:38,389
he's forgotten keys
for a couple of visits,

1489
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:40,949
so one day I blew up and told him:

1490
01:31:41,159 --> 01:31:44,196
"Simon, not only do you write plays,

1491
01:31:44,399 --> 01:31:47,436
"you play
at selling real estate too! "

1492
01:32:06,119 --> 01:32:08,030
Excuse me... Sorry I'm late.

1493
01:32:08,879 --> 01:32:10,107
Work's so hectic...

1494
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,794
Feeling better?
You look good...

1495
01:32:17,999 --> 01:32:18,954
I'm okay...

1496
01:32:22,559 --> 01:32:24,515
What's wrong, Camille? What is it?

1497
01:32:24,679 --> 01:32:25,794
It'll soon pass.

1498
01:32:27,439 --> 01:32:30,670
Oh no, Camille, not again!
What's wrong?

1499
01:32:34,559 --> 01:32:37,119
Why do you keep crying like this?

1500
01:32:38,439 --> 01:32:40,828
Is there something I don't know?

1501
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:43,634
What is it then?

1502
01:32:43,879 --> 01:32:45,995
We shouldn't crowd around her.

1503
01:32:46,199 --> 01:32:47,518
She needs air.

1504
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:48,748
It'll soon pass.

1505
01:32:48,959 --> 01:32:51,473
Yes, don't bother about me.

1506
01:32:52,519 --> 01:32:55,989
We have to,
you're crying in front of everyone.

1507
01:32:56,199 --> 01:32:57,348
That's depression...

1508
01:32:57,559 --> 01:32:59,515
The doctor said that's what it was.

1509
01:32:59,719 --> 01:33:01,391
Has she eaten?

1510
01:33:01,839 --> 01:33:03,318
Depression?

1511
01:33:03,719 --> 01:33:04,674
Nerves?

1512
01:33:05,119 --> 01:33:07,030
Why should she be depressed?

1513
01:33:07,959 --> 01:33:08,994
Rubbish!

1514
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:11,429
Leave her alone and it'll pass.

1515
01:33:12,999 --> 01:33:14,990
Do you want to be alone a bit?

1516
01:33:16,439 --> 01:33:17,235
I'm sorry...

1517
01:33:17,399 --> 01:33:19,117
Don't be silly...

1518
01:33:20,679 --> 01:33:21,998
It's starting again.

1519
01:33:23,679 --> 01:33:25,192
I can't breathe...

1520
01:33:26,879 --> 01:33:28,915
Could we have a window open?

1521
01:33:33,079 --> 01:33:35,832
There's a weight... ten tons...
on my chest...

1522
01:33:38,319 --> 01:33:39,388
Relax...

1523
01:33:40,599 --> 01:33:42,555
You're all tensed up.

1524
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:45,228
Wonderful...
I'm sure she'll relax now.

1525
01:33:46,399 --> 01:33:47,798
I don't know what to do.

1526
01:33:50,039 --> 01:33:51,233
You'll be all right...

1527
01:34:04,279 --> 01:34:05,314
I'm sorry...

1528
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:07,713
but I'd like a word.

1529
01:34:09,519 --> 01:34:11,749
Can I ask you something?

1530
01:34:16,839 --> 01:34:18,830
That's my phone number...

1531
01:34:21,639 --> 01:34:24,278
I bet you're glad you sold this one.

1532
01:34:27,279 --> 01:34:28,268
It wasn't easy.

1533
01:34:29,279 --> 01:34:31,588
- Nothing unusual.
- Still, it was hard.

1534
01:34:32,319 --> 01:34:34,992
What's wrong?
Are you trying to say something?

1535
01:34:35,439 --> 01:34:37,475
What wasn't easy?
Say it clearly.

1536
01:34:38,479 --> 01:34:42,233
I am being clear.
We both know what's wrong.

1537
01:34:44,399 --> 01:34:45,354
Go on then!

1538
01:34:47,439 --> 01:34:48,349
The view...

1539
01:34:48,999 --> 01:34:49,829
What about it?

1540
01:34:50,319 --> 01:34:51,388
That lovely view...

1541
01:34:51,599 --> 01:34:53,874
All right, the view...
What about it?

1542
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:55,629
That she's so fond of...

1543
01:34:55,839 --> 01:34:57,511
Are you doing it on purpose?

1544
01:34:57,719 --> 01:35:00,995
I can't press you on
every three words, try a sentence!

1545
01:35:01,999 --> 01:35:04,672
You know
about the building project opposite.

1546
01:35:04,879 --> 01:35:07,518
You didn't tell her.
That was a full sentence.

1547
01:35:07,719 --> 01:35:10,552
It's a project!
It's nothing definite...

1548
01:35:11,239 --> 01:35:13,469
So please mind your own business.

1549
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:15,590
I heard otherwise.

1550
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:21,155
Your insinuations and moralizing
are getting on my nerves!

1551
01:35:21,599 --> 01:35:24,033
I don't want to talk to you.

1552
01:35:26,199 --> 01:35:30,033
I'm in your way
But you provoked me

1553
01:35:31,519 --> 01:35:35,273
I'm in your way
But I didn't come after you, see

1554
01:35:36,799 --> 01:35:40,678
I'm in your way
I'll hassle you for free

1555
01:35:42,079 --> 01:35:45,754
I'm in your way
But don't blame me

1556
01:35:46,399 --> 01:35:48,196
One day, at the bus-stop,

1557
01:35:48,399 --> 01:35:50,549
it came on like a dizzy spell.

1558
01:35:50,759 --> 01:35:52,158
All my strength's gone.

1559
01:35:53,439 --> 01:35:57,432
I feel as if I'm going to fall down
and die on the spot.

1560
01:35:57,639 --> 01:35:59,197
I'm exactly the same!

1561
01:35:59,799 --> 01:36:02,393
Does your heart beat fast and loud?

1562
01:36:02,559 --> 01:36:04,311
Oh good Lord! All the time!

1563
01:36:04,479 --> 01:36:05,468
And the contrary,

1564
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:07,715
when your heart just stops...

1565
01:36:08,319 --> 01:36:09,593
Do you get that too?

1566
01:36:16,359 --> 01:36:18,111
It could happen now.

1567
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:21,278
As soon as I hear about an illness,
I catch it.

1568
01:36:21,479 --> 01:36:22,798
Yes, so do I.

1569
01:36:22,999 --> 01:36:23,670
I don't.

1570
01:36:23,919 --> 01:36:25,477
I do, right away!

1571
01:36:25,639 --> 01:36:27,357
This is unbelievable!

1572
01:36:27,519 --> 01:36:31,034
What you've described
is exactly what I feel.

1573
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:33,959
I've seen a ton of doctors,
I didn't understand.

1574
01:36:34,159 --> 01:36:35,308
I was worried sick.

1575
01:36:36,479 --> 01:36:38,947
What a relief.
I don't know if it's depression,

1576
01:36:39,159 --> 01:36:42,231
anxiety or panic disorder
but I'm relieved.

1577
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:44,396
Come and talk in the lounge.

1578
01:36:48,879 --> 01:36:51,712
I always act as if I'm in control...

1579
01:36:51,919 --> 01:36:55,673
Why do you need to convince people
that you're in control?

1580
01:36:55,879 --> 01:36:57,471
No chance of that now.

1581
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:04,038
Do you know what I think?

1582
01:37:04,679 --> 01:37:06,510
I prefer you like this.

1583
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:07,994
It's really you.

1584
01:37:08,839 --> 01:37:10,033
That...

1585
01:37:11,119 --> 01:37:12,677
is really you

1586
01:37:13,359 --> 01:37:14,872
You can tell

1587
01:37:15,599 --> 01:37:16,714
That...

1588
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:19,518
is really you

1589
01:37:22,279 --> 01:37:23,632
You...

1590
01:37:24,919 --> 01:37:26,398
you can tell

1591
01:37:26,679 --> 01:37:27,907
you can tell

1592
01:37:28,119 --> 01:37:30,235
you can tell it's you

1593
01:37:31,519 --> 01:37:33,191
You can tell

1594
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:36,869
You can tell it's you

1595
01:37:40,079 --> 01:37:41,228
You and only you

1596
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:56,193
You and nothing but you

1597
01:37:56,919 --> 01:37:59,274
You and nothing but you

1598
01:37:59,599 --> 01:38:01,112
Only you

1599
01:38:19,359 --> 01:38:20,189
Want some?

1600
01:38:20,839 --> 01:38:22,909
No, I don't drink, you know.

1601
01:38:23,559 --> 01:38:24,116
Just a drop...

1602
01:38:24,319 --> 01:38:25,434
I don't like it.

1603
01:38:26,079 --> 01:38:30,118
I've had a drop of champagne.
Any more and I can't control myself,

1604
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:31,594
and I hate that.

1605
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:35,993
When you lose control
Even for a moment

1606
01:38:36,159 --> 01:38:39,708
You not only lose control,
You also lose

1607
01:38:39,919 --> 01:38:43,628
What you imagine and then

1608
01:38:43,799 --> 01:38:47,155
Hundreds of things
you lose for good

1609
01:38:47,599 --> 01:38:51,194
Beware, girl, and don't forget

1610
01:38:51,559 --> 01:38:54,995
When you lose your head
You lose the rest

1611
01:39:00,519 --> 01:39:02,032
I have to tell you this...

1612
01:39:03,319 --> 01:39:05,992
It's about your brother.
I'll be frank.

1613
01:39:07,079 --> 01:39:08,751
He slows the company down.

1614
01:39:09,159 --> 01:39:10,638
His personality is very...

1615
01:39:10,839 --> 01:39:12,397
I know, I know...

1616
01:39:12,559 --> 01:39:14,550
I can't say I'm surprised.

1617
01:39:14,759 --> 01:39:17,034
He's totally unreliable.

1618
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:19,915
I feel better.

1619
01:39:20,799 --> 01:39:21,754
Shall we go?

1620
01:39:22,599 --> 01:39:23,429
Where?

1621
01:39:23,839 --> 01:39:24,988
Home?

1622
01:39:25,199 --> 01:39:26,632
An early night would help...

1623
01:39:29,319 --> 01:39:30,752
I'm not tired...

1624
01:39:32,599 --> 01:39:34,112
Well, you felt odd...

1625
01:39:37,359 --> 01:39:38,917
Are you depressed too?

1626
01:39:39,119 --> 01:39:40,552
I hope so.

1627
01:39:41,359 --> 01:39:43,998
I was worried it was cancer
or something...

1628
01:39:48,279 --> 01:39:49,917
Pity your wife isn't here...

1629
01:39:51,079 --> 01:39:52,273
What's the problem?

1630
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:56,714
It's silly,
a tooth she didn't get seen to.

1631
01:39:57,759 --> 01:39:59,192
So obviously,

1632
01:39:59,559 --> 01:40:02,437
her cheek's all swollen,
she could barely talk...

1633
01:40:05,239 --> 01:40:06,274
No, that's rubbish.

1634
01:40:08,479 --> 01:40:10,071
We argued. She went back.

1635
01:40:11,959 --> 01:40:12,948
Because of...

1636
01:40:13,119 --> 01:40:14,234
Because of me.

1637
01:40:15,079 --> 01:40:16,194
She found out?

1638
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:18,510
What?

1639
01:40:19,959 --> 01:40:21,711
I don't know...

1640
01:40:22,399 --> 01:40:23,514
The other woman...

1641
01:40:23,719 --> 01:40:24,674
Not at all...

1642
01:40:24,879 --> 01:40:26,517
Cut it out, I saw you.

1643
01:40:27,999 --> 01:40:28,909
You did? Where?

1644
01:40:29,319 --> 01:40:30,798
Wednesday, with a blonde...

1645
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,069
A blonde?

1646
01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:36,989
She's a client...

1647
01:40:37,159 --> 01:40:38,797
A client?

1648
01:40:40,199 --> 01:40:41,314
From the Ritz...

1649
01:40:50,159 --> 01:40:53,196
She's all right, that one...
She's no trouble.

1650
01:40:53,359 --> 01:40:54,917
Why do you do all that?

1651
01:40:56,559 --> 01:40:57,435
It's my job.

1652
01:40:58,479 --> 01:40:59,514
I'm a chauffeur.

1653
01:41:03,199 --> 01:41:04,393
Well, when they need me...

1654
01:41:04,759 --> 01:41:05,589
But your business?

1655
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:08,030
- That is my business.
- My God!

1656
01:41:08,239 --> 01:41:08,955
It's not that bad.

1657
01:41:09,159 --> 01:41:10,911
No, I mean, it's terrible...

1658
01:41:11,719 --> 01:41:12,947
Resist!

1659
01:41:14,439 --> 01:41:17,033
Show the world you exist!

1660
01:41:21,199 --> 01:41:22,552
Can I use the phone?

1661
01:41:26,359 --> 01:41:28,395
A hideous pile of dirty plates...

1662
01:41:29,239 --> 01:41:30,752
What a terrible idea.

1663
01:41:31,839 --> 01:41:33,477
You said you liked it.

1664
01:41:33,999 --> 01:41:34,715
I did?

1665
01:41:35,639 --> 01:41:37,436
That first time. I remember.

1666
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:39,114
Not at all...

1667
01:41:40,599 --> 01:41:41,952
Don't you want the raisins?

1668
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:43,475
I hate raisins.

1669
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:45,510
They're full of energy.

1670
01:41:46,159 --> 01:41:48,832
They'd do you good...
Like all dried fruit.

1671
01:41:57,359 --> 01:41:58,712
I can't get used to it.

1672
01:41:59,559 --> 01:42:01,072
Why is that cretin here?

1673
01:42:01,519 --> 01:42:02,554
What cretin?

1674
01:42:03,959 --> 01:42:06,792
I put up with him all week,
now I find him here.

1675
01:42:07,239 --> 01:42:09,355
It's not a very nice surprise.

1676
01:42:11,039 --> 01:42:13,394
That cretin happens to be
a friend of mine.

1677
01:42:14,079 --> 01:42:15,432
Invite whom you like.

1678
01:42:15,879 --> 01:42:17,028
You said it.

1679
01:42:20,559 --> 01:42:21,912
What's up?

1680
01:42:22,759 --> 01:42:25,114
Don't you like my mug?

1681
01:42:27,559 --> 01:42:29,868
Is something wrong?

1682
01:42:31,359 --> 01:42:33,554
Can't you stand it?

1683
01:42:35,159 --> 01:42:37,753
The phone's not hooked up.
What do I do?

1684
01:42:37,959 --> 01:42:38,994
Where's Odile?

1685
01:42:39,559 --> 01:42:40,708
Have you got your...

1686
01:42:44,919 --> 01:42:46,352
Thanks, very kind of you.

1687
01:42:48,479 --> 01:42:50,356
Of course you can invite
whom you want.

1688
01:43:02,919 --> 01:43:06,070
I've come to tell you I'm going away

1689
01:43:08,959 --> 01:43:12,235
You remember the good days
and you cry

1690
01:43:14,879 --> 01:43:19,873
You sob, you sigh but I cannot lie

1691
01:43:20,959 --> 01:43:22,711
The time's come to say

1692
01:43:23,999 --> 01:43:25,671
I'm sorry

1693
01:43:26,759 --> 01:43:28,670
to tell you I'm going away

1694
01:43:29,839 --> 01:43:32,194
I need to live another way

1695
01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:35,711
I've come to tell you I'm going away

1696
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:54,275
Is that good?

1697
01:43:55,759 --> 01:43:57,636
Lemon tart, not bad.

1698
01:43:58,119 --> 01:43:58,790
May I?

1699
01:44:06,879 --> 01:44:08,153
I tried to call my wife.

1700
01:44:09,559 --> 01:44:10,514
The line's busy.

1701
01:44:13,799 --> 01:44:16,313
I was wrong about Camille.
She's all right.

1702
01:44:18,399 --> 01:44:19,798
She's in such a bad way...

1703
01:44:21,559 --> 01:44:23,709
Anyway, what's your dilemma?

1704
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:31,115
I know this flat
and so I should because...

1705
01:44:33,479 --> 01:44:34,514
My God!

1706
01:44:40,519 --> 01:44:43,113
My God! I can't believe it.

1707
01:44:46,919 --> 01:44:48,193
Just opposite!

1708
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:53,678
I'm sorry but I felt
I had to tell you.

1709
01:44:55,959 --> 01:44:59,269
Maybe it's not too late,
you have to find out.

1710
01:45:05,239 --> 01:45:07,673
- I came to tell you...
- I've done something silly...

1711
01:45:08,119 --> 01:45:08,756
You have?

1712
01:45:09,079 --> 01:45:09,829
I'll go now.

1713
01:45:10,039 --> 01:45:12,599
The view's going to be blocked off.

1714
01:45:12,759 --> 01:45:16,991
Buildings everywhere,
an enormous one just opposite...

1715
01:45:17,319 --> 01:45:18,195
Where?

1716
01:45:18,399 --> 01:45:20,196
There, just opposite.

1717
01:45:20,399 --> 01:45:22,833
That bastard never mentioned it!

1718
01:45:23,039 --> 01:45:24,313
Who? Marc Duveyrier?

1719
01:45:24,599 --> 01:45:26,749
- He knew?
- It's my fault.

1720
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:29,713
I rushed into this. I'm such a fool.

1721
01:45:29,919 --> 01:45:32,274
I never asked the planning office.
I'm a fool.

1722
01:45:32,479 --> 01:45:34,151
You're not...

1723
01:45:34,359 --> 01:45:36,236
You weren't to know.

1724
01:45:36,439 --> 01:45:40,068
You trusted him. No one can tell
how honest people are.

1725
01:45:41,439 --> 01:45:43,430
Come on, don't cry like that...

1726
01:45:44,239 --> 01:45:46,116
You're always kind to me.

1727
01:45:48,119 --> 01:45:49,757
I do realize, you know.

1728
01:45:52,199 --> 01:45:54,667
I couldn't live without you,
you know.

1729
01:45:56,999 --> 01:45:58,148
You know that?

1730
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:00,552
No, I didn't know.

1731
01:46:01,279 --> 01:46:02,837
You had something to tell me?

1732
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:05,437
I came to tell you...

1733
01:46:08,239 --> 01:46:12,357
Don't worry, sweetheart
That's life, don't cry

1734
01:46:12,559 --> 01:46:16,154
Forget the swine who did this

1735
01:46:17,079 --> 01:46:21,311
Don't worry, sweetheart
That's life, don't cry

1736
01:46:21,719 --> 01:46:24,916
Please, sweetheart,
Don't cry

1737
01:46:26,239 --> 01:46:28,309
Believe it or not,
I can't find the bathroom.

1738
01:46:30,479 --> 01:46:32,151
I'll keep on looking.

1739
01:46:32,359 --> 01:46:33,428
Mr Duveyrier!

1740
01:46:37,639 --> 01:46:38,833
I have a question for you.

1741
01:46:40,359 --> 01:46:41,269
A question, yes...

1742
01:46:42,519 --> 01:46:44,430
Have you told us everything?

1743
01:46:45,279 --> 01:46:46,314
Yes, of course.

1744
01:46:47,319 --> 01:46:48,718
You left nothing out?

1745
01:46:48,879 --> 01:46:50,631
A building project, say...

1746
01:46:53,919 --> 01:46:56,797
There's no basis to it,
they're just rumours...

1747
01:46:56,999 --> 01:46:59,115
Such projects
are ten a penny in Paris!

1748
01:46:59,319 --> 01:47:02,994
I can't be held responsible
for possible future projects.

1749
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:04,718
You should have told us!

1750
01:47:04,919 --> 01:47:06,034
Told you what?

1751
01:47:06,239 --> 01:47:08,594
Where the hell are his flowers?

1752
01:47:10,239 --> 01:47:12,799
Take your flowers, you hypocrite!
You swindler!

1753
01:47:13,639 --> 01:47:15,277
He beguiled me with flowers!

1754
01:47:16,279 --> 01:47:17,348
Resist!

1755
01:47:18,959 --> 01:47:21,393
Show the world you exist!

1756
01:47:23,319 --> 01:47:25,275
Sorry to disturb you...

1757
01:47:25,479 --> 01:47:29,552
Can you call abroad with this?
I can't get through to England...

1758
01:47:29,799 --> 01:47:30,356
Excuse me...

1759
01:47:32,399 --> 01:47:33,991
I wanted...

1760
01:47:35,079 --> 01:47:36,990
to do you justice, in a way.

1761
01:47:37,359 --> 01:47:38,189
Me?

1762
01:47:39,879 --> 01:47:40,868
When...

1763
01:47:41,439 --> 01:47:43,555
you said I might be depressed...

1764
01:47:44,359 --> 01:47:46,714
I made fun of you, remember?

1765
01:47:48,359 --> 01:47:49,997
I remember very well.

1766
01:47:50,439 --> 01:47:51,872
Well, you were right.

1767
01:47:52,479 --> 01:47:54,071
What do I do now?

1768
01:47:54,279 --> 01:47:55,473
Is that Odile?

1769
01:47:56,199 --> 01:47:57,075
Sorry, my foot!

1770
01:47:58,079 --> 01:48:00,718
I bet you're pleased with yourself.

1771
01:48:00,919 --> 01:48:03,797
You dragged up this nonsense.
You've pulled it off!

1772
01:48:03,999 --> 01:48:04,670
Full marks!

1773
01:48:04,879 --> 01:48:05,755
What's wrong?

1774
01:48:05,959 --> 01:48:07,711
Ask him, he's your friend.

1775
01:48:07,919 --> 01:48:09,238
He'll explain.

1776
01:48:09,559 --> 01:48:11,789
I'm leaving.
I've been thrown out.

1777
01:48:11,999 --> 01:48:13,034
Are you coming?

1778
01:48:13,919 --> 01:48:16,752
No, I'm not going to leave
my sister.

1779
01:48:16,959 --> 01:48:17,994
You want to stay?

1780
01:48:21,839 --> 01:48:22,635
Fine.

1781
01:48:29,599 --> 01:48:33,638
Nobody loves me
I've got no one to love

1782
01:48:34,439 --> 01:48:38,671
People only see
What I want them to see

1783
01:48:39,160 --> 01:48:43,631
Do they try to find out
Where I get my joy?

1784
01:48:44,119 --> 01:48:48,510
And why unhappy doubt
Lingers in this boy?

1785
01:48:52,479 --> 01:48:54,435
Something's wrong,
I know.

1786
01:48:55,239 --> 01:48:57,707
Let's talk without shouting.

1787
01:48:59,919 --> 01:49:02,149
Something turned out wrong
And fell apart.

1788
01:49:02,399 --> 01:49:03,673
Who can say when.

1789
01:49:05,039 --> 01:49:07,553
I can't even make tea,
What will I do now?

1790
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:10,118
True it's pathetic but

1791
01:49:11,679 --> 01:49:13,078
I don't want you to go.

1792
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:16,076
Why?

1793
01:49:17,519 --> 01:49:19,430
Because I waited years for you.

1794
01:49:25,399 --> 01:49:28,675
I looked for you everywhere

1795
01:49:29,239 --> 01:49:33,027
Drinking from the rivers of life
To see the depths

1796
01:49:33,599 --> 01:49:36,750
and lift the stones

1797
01:49:38,039 --> 01:49:42,112
Cutting down trees to see so far

1798
01:49:42,479 --> 01:49:45,039
From New York to Versailles

1799
01:49:49,239 --> 01:49:51,230
I don't want you to go

1800
01:49:55,719 --> 01:49:57,516
Poor Odile...
Her lovely view...

1801
01:49:58,879 --> 01:50:00,835
And her Marc who seemed so sweet.

1802
01:50:02,439 --> 01:50:03,588
"Her" Marc?

1803
01:50:09,639 --> 01:50:11,277
Thank you for coming...

1804
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:14,953
I struggled to stay away but then...

1805
01:50:16,599 --> 01:50:17,554
I'm glad.

1806
01:50:22,559 --> 01:50:24,436
How long does depression last?

1807
01:50:25,559 --> 01:50:27,629
I don't know...
Mine has lasted four years.

1808
01:50:29,479 --> 01:50:30,036
Yours?

1809
01:50:31,399 --> 01:50:32,832
Yes. Four years now.

1810
01:50:34,319 --> 01:50:35,388
Four years!

1811
01:50:37,479 --> 01:50:39,549
But there are good days.

1812
01:50:40,919 --> 01:50:42,034
That's a relief...

1813
01:50:44,119 --> 01:50:45,916
When you're happy, say,

1814
01:50:47,519 --> 01:50:48,918
it's better than before.

1815
01:51:01,839 --> 01:51:03,397
It's nothing, you know.

1816
01:51:05,079 --> 01:51:06,637
Time passes, it's nothing.

1817
01:51:07,039 --> 01:51:08,518
You know

1818
01:51:09,559 --> 01:51:13,791
They sail off like ships
Then suddenly

1819
01:51:14,679 --> 01:51:16,954
come back again

1820
01:51:17,399 --> 01:51:21,551
With each ship that sails away
And returns

1821
01:51:22,359 --> 01:51:26,477
A thousand little boats
On your journey

1822
01:51:27,439 --> 01:51:30,875
Sink and that's only right

1823
01:51:31,239 --> 01:51:33,753
It comes and goes

1824
01:51:33,919 --> 01:51:36,433
Why, no one knows

1825
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:39,473
You sing it and you dance it
You recall it and remember it

1826
01:51:39,639 --> 01:51:41,914
Like a popular song

1827
01:51:42,119 --> 01:51:44,587
Love's like a song that lingers

1828
01:51:44,799 --> 01:51:47,267
As it slips through your fingers

1829
01:51:47,479 --> 01:51:50,277
You sing it and you dance it
You recall it and remember it

1830
01:51:50,479 --> 01:51:52,674
Like a popular song

1831
01:51:52,879 --> 01:51:54,710
I haven't drunk a drop

1832
01:51:55,239 --> 01:51:58,914
The films, they never stop

1833
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:05,439
Where the hero always wins
And bloodshed never begins

1834
01:52:07,039 --> 01:52:10,588
The white boy blues

1835
01:52:43,119 --> 01:52:45,235
That reminds me of something.

1836
01:52:47,319 --> 01:52:49,753
Does anyone know that song?

1837
01:57:02,399 --> 01:57:05,072
