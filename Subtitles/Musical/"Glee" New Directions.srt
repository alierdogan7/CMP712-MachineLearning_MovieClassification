1
00:00:00,383 --> 00:00:02,800
(school bell ringing)
Okay, Holly,

2
00:00:02,815 --> 00:00:05,169
Will Schuester, Mr. Figgins,

3
00:00:05,203 --> 00:00:06,403
Brad the piano player?

4
00:00:06,438 --> 00:00:08,139
Oh, that's easy.

5
00:00:08,173 --> 00:00:10,307
I'd bang Will Schuester,
marry Figgins,

6
00:00:10,342 --> 00:00:12,510
and push Brad the piano player
off a cliff.

7
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,844
What? No way.

8
00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:16,080
Holly, I'd marry Will and
have sex with Figgins.

9
00:00:16,114 --> 00:00:19,049
See, I've gotten real
good at getting my soul

10
00:00:19,084 --> 00:00:21,152
to float above my body
when I'm doing the nasty.

11
00:00:21,186 --> 00:00:22,586
So I'd cringe my way

12
00:00:22,621 --> 00:00:24,388
through a sweaty hump
session with Figgins,

13
00:00:24,422 --> 00:00:26,457
and bone Will Schuester
well into my 60s.

14
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:27,725
Oh, fantastic.

15
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:29,493
Well, well, well.

16
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:31,262
If it isn't April Rhodes,

17
00:00:31,296 --> 00:00:33,731
America's favorite
alcoholic dwarf whore.

18
00:00:33,765 --> 00:00:35,132
Oh, thank you, Sue.

19
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:37,501
Holly and I were just playing
Kill, Marry, or Bone.

20
00:00:37,536 --> 00:00:38,702
Well, April,

21
00:00:38,737 --> 00:00:40,104
as you have absolutely
no business whatsoever

22
00:00:40,138 --> 00:00:41,272
on this campus, normally,

23
00:00:41,306 --> 00:00:42,706
I would have you
physically removed.

24
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:44,208
However, since you seem
to be hanging out

25
00:00:44,242 --> 00:00:47,745
with the willowy
and winning Holly Holliday,

26
00:00:47,779 --> 00:00:49,513
(laughs) I am willing

27
00:00:49,548 --> 00:00:51,389
to make an exception.
Hey, girl.

28
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:52,550
Thanks, Coach.

29
00:00:52,584 --> 00:00:54,084
Wait a second. You
guys know each other?

30
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:55,686
Oh, you bet
your sweet ass we do.

31
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,354
Yup, the minute
I met Miss Holliday,

32
00:00:57,389 --> 00:00:58,689
we immediately hit it off,

33
00:00:58,723 --> 00:01:00,691
and we've been best of friends
ever since.

34
00:01:00,725 --> 00:01:02,927
Mm-hmm. We're auditioning
for<i> The Amazing Race.</i>

35
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:04,929
I'm Principal Sue Sylvester.

36
00:01:04,963 --> 00:01:06,597
And I'm Substitute
Holly Holliday.

37
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:08,232
And together we are...

38
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:10,201
BOTH:
Team Gorgeous!

39
00:01:10,235 --> 00:01:12,236
SUE: <i> As a seven-time
national championship</i>

40
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,972
<i>cheerleading coach, I know what</i>
<i>it's like to work as a team.</i>

41
00:01:15,006 --> 00:01:17,641
(sputtering)

42
00:01:17,676 --> 00:01:19,944
<i>And I'm looking forward</i>
<i>to the physical challenges.</i>

43
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:21,812
HOLLY: <i> And I'm looking
forward to eating</i>

44
00:01:21,847 --> 00:01:23,481
<i>those half-formed</i>
<i>fetal duck eggs!</i>

45
00:01:23,515 --> 00:01:25,716
(both yelling)

46
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,453
So, Sue, um, April and
I were just talking...

47
00:01:29,488 --> 00:01:31,889
No. I'm sorry, Holly.
The glee club's over.

48
00:01:31,923 --> 00:01:34,725
Okay, I know. I just, um...
I was just thinking,

49
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,460
you know, just 'cause
Glee Club is over

50
00:01:36,495 --> 00:01:38,395
doesn't mean that there can't be

51
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,697
any music at the school, right?

52
00:01:39,731 --> 00:01:41,065
What you getting at, Holly?

53
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:43,067
HOLLY: I mean, you
know, there are plenty

54
00:01:43,101 --> 00:01:44,802
of other clubs in this school.
Maybe we could

55
00:01:44,836 --> 00:01:47,071
work a little music into some of them.
That's right, Holly.

56
00:01:47,105 --> 00:01:49,440
You know, it's a proven fact,
when you put music

57
00:01:49,474 --> 00:01:51,142
in the classroom,
test scores go up.

58
00:01:51,176 --> 00:01:52,910
Oh, please, dear God, shut up.

59
00:01:52,944 --> 00:01:54,945
Sue, we're just
asking for one week.

60
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,915
Fine. You have one week
to somehow shoehorn

61
00:01:57,949 --> 00:02:00,684
music into McKinley's
extracurricular clubs.

62
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,854
But, please, see if you can't
involve William in this somehow.

63
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:06,657
It'll soften the blow
of the glee club's cancellation.

64
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:08,926
(school bell ringing)

65
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,762
(laughter)

66
00:02:11,797 --> 00:02:13,037
Ooh!

67
00:02:13,061 --> 00:02:15,483

68
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:17,635
(school bell ringing)

69
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:19,570
TINA: <i> This time in a
person's life is supposed</i>

70
00:02:19,604 --> 00:02:21,084
<i>to feel fresh</i>
<i>and full of possibility.</i>

71
00:02:21,106 --> 00:02:23,474
<i>But unlike every other senior</i>
<i>at this school,</i>

72
00:02:23,508 --> 00:02:26,010
<i>I seem to be the only one</i>
<i>still waiting by the phone</i>

73
00:02:26,044 --> 00:02:27,445
<i>to be invited to the dance.</i>

74
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:30,414
<i>I got rejected by</i>
<i>my backup school, Ohio State,</i>

75
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:32,329
<i>and Brown still hasn't told me</i>
<i>if I got in yet.</i>

76
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,386
<i>And at this point,</i>
<i>I'm taking desperate measures.</i>

77
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,155
<i>I get it. I was adopted,</i>
<i>and I've never been to temple.</i>

78
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,190
<i>But all of my friends</i>
<i>are going to be in New York,</i>

79
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:41,692
<i>and Mitzvah is the only school</i>

80
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:44,028
<i>that is still accepting</i>
<i>for fall semester.</i>

81
00:02:44,062 --> 00:02:46,230
<i>I wrote an essay about why</i>
<i>the reason I'm applying so late</i>

82
00:02:46,264 --> 00:02:48,899
<i>was because I was on a kibbutz,</i>
<i>whatever that is.</i>

83
00:02:48,934 --> 00:02:51,502
<i>So, here we go.</i>

84
00:02:51,536 --> 00:02:52,937
<i>Fingers crossed.</i>

85
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:55,172
<i>I just got to get</i>
<i>to New York somehow.</i>

86
00:02:55,207 --> 00:02:58,976
Well, what are you guys doing?

87
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,878
Well, Mr. Shue wanted us
to pack away the trophies

88
00:03:00,912 --> 00:03:03,392
before Sue came in and
had the Cheerios! do it.

89
00:03:04,182 --> 00:03:07,218
No, don't get upset. Oh.
I'm upset.

90
00:03:07,252 --> 00:03:09,220
Guys, you might want to sit down
for this. I have some huge news.

91
00:03:09,254 --> 00:03:12,389
You guys got married and adopted
Russian twin babies. Yes!

92
00:03:12,424 --> 00:03:14,925
Blaine got into NYADA!
I got into NYADA!

93
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,594
Oh, my God!
Congratulations!

94
00:03:16,628 --> 00:03:17,595
(overlapping chatter)

95
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:19,163
Congratulations.

96
00:03:19,197 --> 00:03:21,165
Wow! Oh, my God! You guys,
do you know what this means?

97
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:23,100
All of us... we're all going
to New York together!

98
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:25,002
(whoops) Oh!

99
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,877
You guys, we're gonna
miss our shift!

100
00:03:34,045 --> 00:03:35,212
Ew!

101
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:36,080
Oh.
Hey! Hey!

102
00:03:36,114 --> 00:03:37,248
If I wanted to watch men

103
00:03:37,282 --> 00:03:38,883
in capri pants
slobbering all over each other,

104
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:40,384
I'd watch<i> Monday Night Football.</i>

105
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:41,419
(canned laughter)

106
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:43,454
(theme music playing)

107
00:04:07,612 --> 00:04:09,480
(applause and cheering)

108
00:04:09,514 --> 00:04:13,083
Whoa! Man, those ten flights
of stairs are a bitch.

109
00:04:13,118 --> 00:04:14,785
I wish this apartment
had an elevator.

110
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,453
It does.

111
00:04:15,487 --> 00:04:16,487
Now you tell me!

112
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:17,588
(laughter)

113
00:04:17,622 --> 00:04:18,823
(audience member whistling)

114
00:04:18,857 --> 00:04:20,958
Sam, where are your clothes?

115
00:04:20,992 --> 00:04:23,227
Oh. I think I left 'em
at the Laundromat.

116
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:25,162
(laughter) Again?

117
00:04:25,197 --> 00:04:27,031
Aah! Rachel, quit
hogging the bathroom!

118
00:04:27,065 --> 00:04:29,066
RACHEL: I'm never
coming out of here!

119
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:31,021
That's what I said
sophomore year of high school.

120
00:04:31,036 --> 00:04:32,436
(applause and cheering)

121
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:35,005
I'm serious!
Open the G-dang door!

122
00:04:39,742 --> 00:04:42,222
I'm never getting
spray-tanned again

123
00:04:42,247 --> 00:04:43,481
at a Vietnamese doughnut shop.

124
00:04:43,515 --> 00:04:45,149
Where do we keep the ketchup?

125
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,703
ALL:
Mike Chang!

126
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:47,918
What are you doing here?

127
00:04:47,953 --> 00:04:50,187
I'm here to win Tina back.

128
00:04:50,222 --> 00:04:53,124
Did I say that out loud?

129
00:04:53,158 --> 00:04:55,226
Also, I'm here to teach
dance to the homeless,

130
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,695
and I brought a few
chums to help me out.

131
00:04:57,729 --> 00:04:59,497
(noise-makers sounding)

132
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:01,799
(applause and cheering)

133
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,267
Sam, where's your clothes?

134
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:05,669
Oh. I knew I forgot something.

135
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:07,972
(canned laughter)
(sitcom musical sting)

136
00:05:08,006 --> 00:05:09,974
Oh, my gosh, Tina,
I-I'm so sorry.

137
00:05:10,008 --> 00:05:12,376
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm great.

138
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,879
You guys, New York,

139
00:05:14,913 --> 00:05:18,382
it's gonna be amazing.

140
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:21,318
MERCEDES: You know, being here
with everyone has brought

141
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:24,188
so many good feelings
and memories,

142
00:05:24,222 --> 00:05:26,123
and... I mean, look
at Puck and Quinn.

143
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:27,658
I mean, I have no idea
what's going on there,

144
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:28,826
nor do I know
where her boyfriend

145
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,462
ran off to, but it looks
like we can be expecting

146
00:05:31,496 --> 00:05:33,664
another "accidental"
pregnancy sometime soon.

147
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:35,332
(whoops) Yeah, yeah.

148
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:37,301
Yeah! KURT: But, alas,

149
00:05:37,335 --> 00:05:40,838
with the old good feelings
come the old bad ones, too.

150
00:05:40,872 --> 00:05:43,007
Why, just today, Mercedes and I
were in the lunch line

151
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,775
when a battle from
way back in the day

152
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,444
came out,
a-and we found ourselves

153
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:47,878
at each other's throats again.

154
00:05:47,913 --> 00:05:50,714
They have zero
nutritional value.

155
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:52,716
Listen,
potatoes are vegetables, okay?

156
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:54,385
And Tots are made from potatoes.

157
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,555
Ergo, Tots are vegetables.

158
00:05:57,589 --> 00:06:00,357
Well, I'd like some kind of proof of
how much potato is actually in there.

159
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:01,525
And ruin the mystery?

160
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,195
What in the hell is wrong
with you? Move it.

161
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:07,364
Yes, I know. It's really
hard to see friends fighting,

162
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,266
but I'm just glad that none of
you guys were there to see it.

163
00:06:09,301 --> 00:06:10,668
I was right behind you in line.

164
00:06:10,702 --> 00:06:13,537
Because the most upsetting thing
is watching two people you love

165
00:06:13,572 --> 00:06:15,840
fight about
something ridiculous

166
00:06:15,874 --> 00:06:18,042
and there not being anything
you can do to stop it.

167
00:06:18,076 --> 00:06:21,879
But, thankfully, we made up
and we have never been closer.

168
00:06:21,913 --> 00:06:23,881
- Mmm. - And we've decided
to heal our hearts

169
00:06:23,915 --> 00:06:25,282
with a song.

170
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:30,688

171

(school bell rings)

211
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,675
You remember when we first met?

212
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:23,410
I was in here doing my hair...

213
00:09:23,444 --> 00:09:26,012
Are you trying to make peace with
me by getting all nostalgic?

214
00:09:26,047 --> 00:09:27,847
Because, if so, you are
forgetting the one thing

215
00:09:27,882 --> 00:09:30,362
that you should have learned
from all of our magical time

216
00:09:30,384 --> 00:09:32,152
together, and it's
that I have no heart.

217
00:09:32,186 --> 00:09:34,321
Look, I've been unkind
to you, okay?

218
00:09:34,355 --> 00:09:36,323
And-and I won't get
into the whole thing

219
00:09:36,357 --> 00:09:38,325
about how watching Kurt and Mercedes
sing got me all sentimental

220
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:40,327
because I know you'll just
make fun of me for it.

221
00:09:40,361 --> 00:09:42,529
No, you know what?
Go ahead, please.

222
00:09:42,563 --> 00:09:45,465
Because if I don't express
my venom at least once a day,

223
00:09:45,499 --> 00:09:46,733
I get constipated.

224
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:47,867
I want to give you ten shows.

225
00:09:47,902 --> 00:09:50,570
Any ten shows after
the first three months,

226
00:09:50,604 --> 00:09:52,038
all right?

227
00:09:52,073 --> 00:09:54,908
And you can pick. They can be
ten in a row or one at a time.

228
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,377
It's a peace offering.

229
00:09:57,411 --> 00:09:59,879
That way, your mom can come
or your<i> abuela.</i>

230
00:09:59,914 --> 00:10:02,148
I just... I don't want
to do this anymore.

231
00:10:02,183 --> 00:10:03,817
It's exhausting
and it's depressing.

232
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:07,153
(chuckles) No.

233
00:10:07,188 --> 00:10:08,688
I want them all.

234
00:10:08,723 --> 00:10:10,390
The only reason
why you're doing this

235
00:10:10,424 --> 00:10:12,192
for me is because you know
that I'm gonna go

236
00:10:12,226 --> 00:10:13,660
all<i> Showgirls</i> on you and win.

237
00:10:13,694 --> 00:10:15,695
No more scraps, Rachel.

238
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,098
I will be happy
and kiss and be friends

239
00:10:18,132 --> 00:10:19,599
once you give me the part.

240
00:10:19,634 --> 00:10:22,936
God, what is it about anymore
with you, Santana?

241
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,537
I just... I don't get it.

242
00:10:27,642 --> 00:10:29,376
Yeah.

243
00:10:31,777 --> 00:10:34,257
I'm just not sold
on the whole idea.

244
00:10:34,282 --> 00:10:36,116
Will, this is going
to work. I swear.

245
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,051
You just have to trust me.
Okay...

gave me insight into how

250
00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:51,932
to slaughter livestock
in a more humane way.

251
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:56,403
I think in pictures, not words,
and I'm hypersensitive

301
00:13:58,653 --> 00:14:00,553
I also...

302
00:14:00,588 --> 00:14:03,723
got you this.

303
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:08,595
Two tickets to Lesbos Island?

304
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:11,531
But these are
both one-way.

305
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:14,668
Yeah, I figured once we arrived
at the girl-on-girl paradise

306
00:14:14,702 --> 00:14:17,504
that is Lesbos
that we'd never want to leave.

307
00:14:20,474 --> 00:14:22,442
Okay, listen.

308
00:14:22,476 --> 00:14:24,044
Brittany, I love you, but

309
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:26,713
running away with me and
living on a lesbian island

310
00:14:26,747 --> 00:14:28,548
is not what you want to do.

311
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:31,284
You just don't want
to go back to MIT.

312
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:32,953
And you shouldn't.

313
00:14:32,987 --> 00:14:35,855
Just because your amazing
mathematical mind can solve

314
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,458
all the world's problems
doesn't mean that it has to.

315
00:14:38,492 --> 00:14:41,595
It's not your dream, and
neither is being with me.

316
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:42,862
You're one to talk.

317
00:14:42,897 --> 00:14:45,165
Since when is becoming a
Broadway star your goal in life?

318
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,719
A star is a star. It doesn't
matter where in the sky I shine.

319
00:14:47,735 --> 00:14:50,170
I don't want to run away with
you because I want to run away.

320
00:14:50,204 --> 00:14:51,805
I want to run away
with you because

321
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,307
you and I are the only truly
awesome people I've ever met,

322
00:14:54,342 --> 00:14:55,642
and I'm tired of doing stuff

323
00:14:55,676 --> 00:14:57,344
that only matters
to people less awesome than us.

324
00:14:57,378 --> 00:15:01,114
Okay, but this isn't
like your math stuff.

325
00:15:01,148 --> 00:15:03,383
I'm going to be
rich and famous.

326
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:05,452
This is a great
first step for me.

327
00:15:05,486 --> 00:15:08,121
And, besides, I'm not gonna
let that dwarf Berry win.

328
00:15:08,155 --> 00:15:10,390
(clicks tongue)

329
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:12,392
Listen...

330
00:15:12,426 --> 00:15:15,629
you have spent most
of your life in the closet

331
00:15:15,663 --> 00:15:18,798
because you cared about
what people thought about you.

332
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,700
Walking away from a dream

333
00:15:20,735 --> 00:15:23,069
that you don't actually
care about is you winning,

334
00:15:23,104 --> 00:15:24,838
because it's you saying,

335
00:15:24,872 --> 00:15:27,707
"This is not who I am,
and I don't care who knows it."

336
00:15:27,742 --> 00:15:29,743
(laughs quietly)

337
00:15:31,445 --> 00:15:33,413
You know, it's funny.

338
00:15:33,447 --> 00:15:37,183
I spend months
tangled up in knots,

339
00:15:37,218 --> 00:15:39,853
and in five minutes,
you straighten me out.

340
00:15:39,887 --> 00:15:41,254
Mm.

341
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:43,256
You really are a genius.

342
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,991
I'm just the world's
foremost expert

343
00:15:45,026 --> 00:15:46,726
in the field of Santana Lopez.

344
00:15:46,761 --> 00:15:48,028
(laughs)

345
00:15:48,062 --> 00:15:52,265
So... what do you want to do?

346

347
00:15:58,887 --> 00:16:00,221
(sighs)
My life is literally over.

348
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,356
Where the hell did all
these flowers come from?

349
00:16:02,391 --> 00:16:03,524
BLAINE:
What's wrong, Tina?

350
00:16:03,558 --> 00:16:04,959
Nothing. Just the fact
that I'm going

351
00:16:04,993 --> 00:16:06,794
to spend the rest
of my life in Lima

352
00:16:06,828 --> 00:16:08,429
because I'm not Jewish enough.

353
00:16:08,463 --> 00:16:10,698
MAN:
<i>Dear Tina, Mitzvah University</i>

354
00:16:10,732 --> 00:16:13,334
was delighted
to receive your application,

355
00:16:13,368 --> 00:16:15,336
albeit five weeks late.

356
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,971
<i>However, we know the truth.</i>

357
00:16:17,005 --> 00:16:18,673
<i>Your name is not Tina Cohen.</i>

358
00:16:18,707 --> 00:16:21,442
You are Tina Cohen-Chang.

359
00:16:21,476 --> 00:16:23,644
You are a big, fat liar.

360
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,212
I didn't get into Mitzvah,
so I guess

361
00:16:25,247 --> 00:16:27,648
I'm the only one in this room
who's not going to New York.

362
00:16:27,683 --> 00:16:30,017
Why? You don't need a college
acceptance letter to get over

363
00:16:30,052 --> 00:16:32,119
that bridge. I can't just go
there without some kind of plan.

364
00:16:32,154 --> 00:16:34,755
Well, uh, Kurt did, and I think
he's doing pretty great.

365
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,391
It's an adventure. Not for me.
You don't understand.

366
00:16:37,426 --> 00:16:39,226
Without some kind of
direction, I just feel

367
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:41,329
like a giant,
free-floating loser.

368
00:16:41,363 --> 00:16:42,763
Yeah, like me.

369
00:16:42,798 --> 00:16:44,231
And me.

370
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:46,133

(laughs)

423
00:19:32,834 --> 00:19:35,036
Hey, please, please, please,
please come to New York.

424
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,537
You don't need a plan.
You'll figure something out

425
00:19:36,571 --> 00:19:38,172
once you get there.
We can get an apartment.

426
00:19:38,206 --> 00:19:39,540
You guys are the best.

427
00:19:40,442 --> 00:19:41,342
Let's do this.

428
00:19:41,376 --> 00:19:43,077
ALL:
Yeah.

429
00:19:43,111 --> 00:19:44,178
(cheering) (whoops)

430
00:19:44,212 --> 00:19:45,413
Nick, I'm a good friend
of yours,

431
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:46,847
and in a dumb way,
I'm kind of smart.

432
00:19:46,882 --> 00:19:48,416
So I'm gonna tell you
what you ought to do.

433
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,951
You ought to marry me.

434
00:19:49,985 --> 00:19:51,665
So I'm gonna tell you
what you ought to do.

435
00:19:51,687 --> 00:19:53,054
- You ought to ma...
- Well...

436
00:19:53,088 --> 00:19:54,855
you certainly are dedicated.

437
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,824
Well, under normal
circumstances I would be,

438
00:19:56,858 --> 00:19:58,098
but considering the fact

439
00:19:58,126 --> 00:20:00,194
that I have to worry
about you pushing me

440
00:20:00,228 --> 00:20:03,097
off the stage at any moment,
I can't slip, even for a second.

441
00:20:03,131 --> 00:20:05,399
Well, I don't like that.

442
00:20:05,434 --> 00:20:07,435
You have been

443
00:20:07,469 --> 00:20:10,905
dreaming about this role
since you were in gay-utero.

444
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:12,873
And you have actually worked

445
00:20:12,908 --> 00:20:14,408
your tiny butt off to get it,

446
00:20:14,443 --> 00:20:16,711
and I'm coming and sucking
all the celebration out of it.

447
00:20:16,745 --> 00:20:18,880
Why?

448
00:20:18,914 --> 00:20:21,048
Honestly, like,
what have I ever done to you?

449
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,717
Nothing.

450
00:20:22,751 --> 00:20:25,419
I'm just not a
particularly nice person.

451
00:20:25,454 --> 00:20:27,154
And sometimes I make choices

452
00:20:27,189 --> 00:20:29,924
that seem like the right thing
at the time, but then,

453
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,893
looking back,
they're actually kind of mean.

454
00:20:31,927 --> 00:20:33,828
Listen, I don't want
to be a Broadway star.

455
00:20:33,862 --> 00:20:35,730
I'm too lazy
to do eight shows a week.

456
00:20:35,764 --> 00:20:39,267
Wait. So, does... does that mean
that you're quitting the show?

457
00:20:39,301 --> 00:20:43,471
I texted gay-face director
ten minutes ago,

458
00:20:43,505 --> 00:20:45,806
and said, "I hereby
resign as U.S.

459
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:47,775
of this production of F.G."

460
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:49,810
- Pithy.
- Listen,

461
00:20:49,845 --> 00:20:52,246
don't get all sentimental
on me or anything like that.

462
00:20:52,281 --> 00:20:55,249
I'm really happy for you,
but I didn't do this for you.

463
00:20:55,284 --> 00:20:57,118
I did this entirely for myself.

464
00:20:57,152 --> 00:21:00,655
I know,
and that was very brave of you.

465
00:21:00,689 --> 00:21:04,358
But do you think
that we could maybe at least

466
00:21:04,393 --> 00:21:06,494
sing a song together
in the glee club?

467
00:21:06,528 --> 00:21:09,931
Fine. But I'm not gonna sing
some tired old song

468
00:21:09,965 --> 00:21:11,732
that we've already done.
'Cause Santana Lopez

469

aren't a million of them.

520
00:23:37,846 --> 00:23:39,480
There's really only 100,000,

521
00:23:39,515 --> 00:23:42,550
but each and every one of 'em
is an uptight bitch.

522
00:23:43,576 --> 00:23:45,496
I hardly need to tell you
that this

523
00:23:45,521 --> 00:23:46,821
will mark the end

524
00:23:46,855 --> 00:23:49,457
of your extracurricular
musical experiment.

525
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:50,968
I understand.

526
00:23:50,993 --> 00:23:52,293
I'm sorry about this, Sue.

527
00:23:52,327 --> 00:23:53,567
It won't happen again.

528
00:23:54,229 --> 00:23:56,097
Will.

529
00:23:56,131 --> 00:23:57,198
Will.

530
00:23:57,232 --> 00:23:59,467
Will, Will.
Wait one second, please.

531
00:23:59,501 --> 00:24:00,935
This isn't over yet.

532
00:24:00,969 --> 00:24:03,604
We can go to the hockey team,
and we can do<i> Glee on Ice.</i>

533
00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:05,139
Please. Stop.

534
00:24:06,275 --> 00:24:08,176
Look, it's finished.

535
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,044
The glee club is over.

536
00:24:10,078 --> 00:24:12,647
All I want to do is just get
through this week

537
00:24:12,681 --> 00:24:13,981
and-and try to enjoy graduation.

538
00:24:15,818 --> 00:24:18,786
I've accepted it.

539
00:24:18,821 --> 00:24:20,121
It's done.

540
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:26,694
Artie Pants, I need you.

541
00:24:26,728 --> 00:24:28,629
Oh, finally.
I'm in love with you, too.

542
00:24:28,664 --> 00:24:30,465
Just give me a second.
I'm gonna send Kitty

543
00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:32,133
- a breakup text.
- What?

544
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:33,701
No, this is about Will.

545
00:24:33,735 --> 00:24:35,470
Oh. Y-You're in love with Will?

546
00:24:35,504 --> 00:24:37,271
No. I'm not in love with anyone.

547
00:24:37,306 --> 00:24:39,707
Get your camera equipment,
meet me in the Spanish room.

I'd like to make
an announcement.

595
00:27:09,089 --> 00:27:10,490
Puck has asked me to
go out with him

596
00:27:10,524 --> 00:27:11,791
as boyfriend and girlfriend.

597
00:27:11,826 --> 00:27:14,527
'Cause, you know,
we've never actually dated.

598
00:27:14,562 --> 00:27:18,198
So, um, I decided to throw
caution to the wind and say yes.

599
00:27:18,232 --> 00:27:19,866
Wait, what?

600
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,568
Yeah, I-I can't make
any promises,

601
00:27:21,602 --> 00:27:23,069
but, you know,
you're the only guy

602
00:27:23,103 --> 00:27:25,471
who's actually been okay
with me just being myself.

603
00:27:25,506 --> 00:27:28,141
Well, once you've seen a baby come
out of a girl's magic garden,

604
00:27:28,175 --> 00:27:30,076
everything else is
easily acceptable.

605
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,846
QUINN: I think I love you, Puck.
And I know

606
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,515
it's not gonna be easy, what
with me in New Haven and you...

607
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:37,016
who knows where.

608
00:27:37,051 --> 00:27:40,787
But I'd rather do hard with you
than easy with somebody else.

609
00:27:40,821 --> 00:27:41,821
Wanky.

610
00:27:41,856 --> 00:27:43,490
Santana, for once,
I'd appreciate it

611
00:27:43,524 --> 00:27:45,325
if you'd keep your
inevitable snark to yourself.

612
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:46,726
No, no. Look,
I got to be honest,

613
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,194
I really like this pairing.

614
00:27:48,229 --> 00:27:50,563
(chuckles) Come here.

00:27:50,598 --> 00:27:52,665
(cheering)

616
00:27:55,736 --> 00:27:59,372
Well, in many ways,
that brings us full circle,

617
00:27:59,406 --> 00:28:01,608
which is perfect because

618
00:28:01,642 --> 00:28:04,611
that was officially...

619
00:28:04,645 --> 00:28:07,180
the last song that will ever
be sung in Glee Club.

620
00:28:08,782 --> 00:28:10,216
We all have more songs to sing.

621
00:28:10,251 --> 00:28:12,919
We just can't sing them
in here anymore.

622
00:28:12,953 --> 00:28:15,889
(sighs) Glee Club...

623
00:28:15,923 --> 00:28:19,359
is officially over.

624
00:28:19,393 --> 00:28:22,095
Thank you, guys.

625
00:28:22,129 --> 00:28:23,897
It's been an honor.

626
00:28:35,376 --> 00:28:37,377

627
00:29:07,341 --> 00:29:09,342

628
00:29:26,897 --> 00:29:28,337
RACHEL:
Hey.

629
00:29:28,362 --> 00:29:30,931
So, we don't actually
know your name

630
00:29:30,965 --> 00:29:33,266
because this video was
made before you were born,

631
00:29:33,301 --> 00:29:35,736
but you are the son or
daughter of our teacher.

632
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,337
KURT:
Will Schuester.

633
00:29:37,372 --> 00:29:39,740
You know, many of us don't get
to know our dads as men

634
00:29:39,774 --> 00:29:41,041
until they're older,

635
00:29:41,075 --> 00:29:44,111
past middle age, maybe
a little beaten down by life.

636
00:29:44,145 --> 00:29:46,113
But we want to tell you
about what your dad was like

637
00:29:46,147 --> 00:29:47,347
when he was young.

638
00:29:47,382 --> 00:29:48,749
When he could dance
like Fred Astaire.

639
00:29:48,783 --> 00:29:50,717
MARLEY:
And sing like Michael Bublé.

640
00:29:50,752 --> 00:29:51,885
He was an amazing teacher.

641
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,420
Your dad and I almost hooked up,

642
00:29:53,454 --> 00:29:54,888
which means
I could have been your mom.

643
00:29:54,922 --> 00:29:56,962
Hit me up when you want
your first tattoo.

644
00:29:56,991 --> 00:29:58,358
I know a guy.

645
00:29:58,393 --> 00:29:59,459
If it wasn't for your dad,

646
00:29:59,494 --> 00:30:00,794
I would've never been
Prom Queen,

647
00:30:00,828 --> 00:30:02,669
though that was kind of
a bad experience for me

648
00:30:02,697 --> 00:30:04,131
when I think about it.

649
00:30:04,165 --> 00:30:06,605
But I still would've been living
my life with a fake stutter.

650
00:30:07,135 --> 00:30:08,435
You had to be there.

651
00:30:08,469 --> 00:30:10,037
Okay, it may seem
a little weird to you,

652
00:30:10,071 --> 00:30:11,938
but back here in the Dark Ages,

653
00:30:11,973 --> 00:30:14,541
it was still crazy
for girls to love girls

654
00:30:14,575 --> 00:30:15,876
and guys to love guys,

655
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,711
but your dad made sure

656
00:30:17,745 --> 00:30:19,546
that we felt safe
loving whoever we chose.

657
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,783
BRITTANY: He does this magic trick
where he pulls a duck out of a hat.

658
00:30:22,817 --> 00:30:25,919
You should have him
show you sometime.

659
00:30:25,953 --> 00:30:27,821
SAM: <i> Your dad had a
passion for teaching.</i>

660
00:30:27,855 --> 00:30:29,890
He really loved that moment
when he connected with a kid.

661
00:30:29,924 --> 00:30:32,059
And he was prone to
overemotional (laughs)

662
00:30:32,093 --> 00:30:34,094
yet often inspiring pep talks.

663
00:30:34,128 --> 00:30:37,164
To put it simply, I was not
a particularly nice person.

664
00:30:37,198 --> 00:30:39,066
(book thumps)

665
00:30:40,101 --> 00:30:41,735
That sweater's legit.

666
00:30:41,769 --> 00:30:43,070
<i>And then your dad came along,</i>

667
00:30:43,104 --> 00:30:44,471
and I became a man who was kind

668
00:30:44,505 --> 00:30:46,273
a relatively large portion
of the time.

669
00:30:46,307 --> 00:30:49,643
I can say without a doubt
that your dad saved my life.

670
00:30:49,677 --> 00:30:51,912
Little Hepburn and Tracy
wouldn't have a daddy

671
00:30:51,946 --> 00:30:53,313
if it wasn't for your dad.

672
00:30:53,348 --> 00:30:55,782
Those are the names of my kids
who aren't born yet either.

673
00:30:55,817 --> 00:30:56,783
We used a surrogate.

674
00:30:56,818 --> 00:30:58,118
I donated the egg.

675
00:30:58,152 --> 00:30:59,219
UNIQUE:
In the whole wide world,

676
00:30:59,253 --> 00:31:00,620
you'll never meet a man
more accepting

677
00:31:00,655 --> 00:31:03,223
and open to nature in all
its wonders than your father.

678
00:31:03,257 --> 00:31:04,291
He's a gem.

679
00:31:04,325 --> 00:31:06,460
SUE:
The best thing about your dad

680
00:31:06,494 --> 00:31:08,328
and that horrible perm of his

681
00:31:08,363 --> 00:31:12,332
is that no matter
how talentless, misshapen, ugly,

682
00:31:12,367 --> 00:31:15,202
miserable
or sexually ambiguous you are,

683
00:31:15,236 --> 00:31:17,504
he will still love you
unconditionally.

684
00:31:17,538 --> 00:31:20,173
ARTIE: Your dad made sure
that everyone in this school

685
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:21,475
understood what it was like

686
00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:22,976
to see the world
from this chair,

687
00:31:23,011 --> 00:31:25,245
and he helped me see
all that I could be

688
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,546
even though I was in it.

689
00:31:26,581 --> 00:31:28,148
He is the most genuine...

690
00:31:28,182 --> 00:31:29,683
honest...
...kind...

691
00:31:29,717 --> 00:31:31,852
generous...
...sand dollar...

692
00:31:33,588 --> 00:31:36,323
amazing man any of us
have ever met.

693
00:31:36,357 --> 00:31:40,394
He loved and looked
after every one of us

694
00:31:40,428 --> 00:31:42,796
with as much care and concern
as he does for you.

695
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:47,634
We love your dad.
We love him very, very much,

696
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:51,004
and no matter where we are
or what we're doing,

697
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,939
he's with us.

698
00:31:52,974 --> 00:31:55,442
Because we have his name
tattooed in our hearts.

You done good, Holly Holliday.

763

You, too, babe.

764
00:35:31,826 --> 00:35:33,293
Our work is done here.

765
00:35:33,328 --> 00:35:36,496
We did it flawlessly and
looked flawless while doing it.

766
00:35:36,531 --> 00:35:38,031
Amen.

767
00:35:38,066 --> 00:35:39,733
Hey, do you want
to go get drunk,

768
00:35:39,767 --> 00:35:41,435
rob a bank and sail
around the world

769
00:35:41,469 --> 00:35:42,903
on one of those
gayboy cruise ships?

770
00:35:42,937 --> 00:35:46,039
We'd be the only women there
and get all the attention.

771
00:35:46,074 --> 00:35:47,274
(slow gasp)

772
00:35:47,308 --> 00:35:48,742
I thought you'd never ask.

773
00:35:48,776 --> 00:35:50,777
(both giggle)

774
00:35:57,764 --> 00:36:00,244
Kitty, when you
see me in the hall,

775
00:36:00,269 --> 00:36:01,603
will you say hello?

776
00:36:01,637 --> 00:36:03,571
Of course. Someone's
got to tell you your shoes

777
00:36:03,606 --> 00:36:04,773
don't match your purse.

778
00:36:04,807 --> 00:36:06,975
Cheerio, please.
My shoes always match.

779
00:36:07,009 --> 00:36:10,745
I cannot believe that Sue
Sylvester finally shut us down.

780
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:13,181
She won.

781
00:36:13,215 --> 00:36:15,216
She actually won.

782
00:36:19,826 --> 00:36:21,866
You guys, you're gonna
miss my big moment.

783
00:36:21,891 --> 00:36:24,125
Get your butts
to the auditorium.

784
00:36:25,659 --> 00:36:28,139
Hang on a second.

785
00:36:28,164 --> 00:36:31,566
Sue Sylvester didn't win.

786
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,435
Maybe she took away Glee Club,

787
00:36:33,469 --> 00:36:35,937
but she'll never
take away what we had.

788
00:36:35,971 --> 00:36:38,640
We were part
of something incredible.

789
00:36:38,674 --> 00:36:39,974
It was more than that.

790
00:36:40,009 --> 00:36:41,543
You know, we helped
each other become

791
00:36:41,577 --> 00:36:44,279
better people in this room.

792
00:36:44,313 --> 00:36:47,115
No one can ever
take that away from us.

793
00:36:47,149 --> 00:36:48,383
(sighs)

794
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:52,420
Come here. Bring it in, guys.
Come here.

795
00:36:52,455 --> 00:36:54,189
You remember Superman?
I do, that was good.

796
00:36:54,223 --> 00:36:56,658
That was good. This broom is
poking me in places I don't...

797
00:36:56,692 --> 00:37:00,261
Arthur Abrams.
(applause)

798
00:37:00,296 --> 00:37:02,297
(whooping, cheering)

799
00:37:07,536 --> 00:37:08,870
Blaine Anderson.

800
00:37:12,074 --> 00:37:14,175
Tina Cohen-Chang.

801
00:37:18,314 --> 00:37:20,849
Sam Evans.

802
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,786
Rebecca Jackson.

803
00:37:29,859 --> 00:37:31,826
(whooping, cheering)

804
00:37:44,273 --> 00:37:47,842
Blaine, you guys, I can't
go to New York with you.

805
00:37:47,877 --> 00:37:50,311
Tina Cohen-Crazy. You can't
get cold feet on us now.

806
00:37:50,346 --> 00:37:51,780
No, it's not that.

807
00:37:51,814 --> 00:37:53,615
I was gonna tell you later, but

808
00:37:53,649 --> 00:37:56,351
the Dean of Admissions from
Brown called me this morning...

809
00:37:56,385 --> 00:37:59,220
And you got in? I got in.
I'm going to Brown!

810
00:37:59,255 --> 00:38:00,622
Oh! Tina. Congratulations.

811
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:01,856
Wow, that is great.

812
00:38:01,891 --> 00:38:03,525
(laughing): Thank you.

813
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:04,893
And, finally...

814
00:38:05,828 --> 00:38:07,896
Brittany S. Pierce.

815
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:10,732
(cheering, applause)

816
00:38:12,802 --> 00:38:15,236
I called in some
favors with Sue.

817
00:38:15,271 --> 00:38:18,239
I figure that everybody deserves
a high school graduation,

818
00:38:18,274 --> 00:38:20,542
even if it's a year late.

819
00:38:20,576 --> 00:38:22,711
(kiss) (exclaims)

820
00:38:22,745 --> 00:38:26,648
You guys, I'm graduating.
(whooping)

821
00:38:29,716 --> 00:38:32,196
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you

822
00:38:32,221 --> 00:38:35,690
the William McKinley High
graduating class of 2013.

823
00:38:35,725 --> 00:38:36,925
(whooping)

824
00:38:47,003 --> 00:38:49,037
Brittany, I have
to tell you something.

825
00:38:49,071 --> 00:38:50,639
I think I've made
a huge mistake.

826
00:38:50,673 --> 00:38:52,774
You don't want to run away
with me, do you. What?

827
00:38:52,808 --> 00:38:55,510
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Of course I do.

828
00:38:55,544 --> 00:38:58,647
(groans) I was doing some
research on Lesbos island,

829
00:38:58,681 --> 00:39:01,383
and it turns out that it's not
chock-full of lesbians.

830
00:39:01,417 --> 00:39:03,518
It's full of German
tourists, so,

831
00:39:03,552 --> 00:39:05,120
I bought us our return tickets.

832
00:39:05,154 --> 00:39:08,189
I think that we should
go to Lesbos first,

833
00:39:08,224 --> 00:39:10,025
and then Hawaii
for a couple of weeks,

834
00:39:10,059 --> 00:39:11,059
and then come home.

835
00:39:11,093 --> 00:39:12,927
Well, I don't want
to go back to MIT

836
00:39:12,962 --> 00:39:14,596
and I can't return to Lima.

837
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:18,133
I want you to come
to New York with me.

838
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:20,568
Is that a yes?
Yes.

839
00:39:20,603 --> 00:39:22,604
(soft laugh)

840
00:39:27,276 --> 00:39:29,411
(sighs)

841
00:39:29,445 --> 00:39:31,212
Here for one last
verbal beatdown?

842
00:39:31,247 --> 00:39:33,515
These are my last two

843
00:39:33,549 --> 00:39:35,250
Razzle Dazzle Fruit
Punch wine coolers

844
00:39:35,284 --> 00:39:36,818
from my cellar.

845
00:39:36,852 --> 00:39:39,421
Company went out of
business back in the '80s,

846
00:39:39,455 --> 00:39:42,891
and I've been saving them
for a special occasion.

847
00:39:42,925 --> 00:39:45,727
Well, what could be more special
than the glee club's funeral?

848
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:46,828
Mm.

849
00:39:49,365 --> 00:39:51,900
Well... (exhales)

850
00:39:51,934 --> 00:39:53,935
You finally won.

851
00:40:00,276 --> 00:40:03,678
Honestly, I-I don't get the
way you see the world, William,

852
00:40:03,713 --> 00:40:05,513
but I got to give you this:

853
00:40:05,548 --> 00:40:07,248
whatever it is you
did in this room,

854
00:40:07,283 --> 00:40:09,951
you changed a lot of kids'
lives for the better.

855
00:40:09,986 --> 00:40:12,520
And your own.
As you know,

856
00:40:12,555 --> 00:40:14,789
I find both of your
spouses intolerable

857
00:40:14,824 --> 00:40:18,126
and bony, but at least
this one is kind to you.

858
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,628
Yeah, I'm not gonna miss this.

859
00:40:19,662 --> 00:40:22,063
Oh, I am.

860
00:40:22,098 --> 00:40:24,499
Nobody ever went the
distance with Sue Sylvester

861
00:40:24,533 --> 00:40:26,067
the way you did, Will.

862
00:40:26,102 --> 00:40:27,636
My whole life

863
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:31,039
I've been searching for
a worthy adversary.

864
00:40:31,073 --> 00:40:33,041
(sighs)

865
00:40:33,075 --> 00:40:35,395
I'm gonna miss the fight.

866
00:40:36,879 --> 00:40:38,346
I could have done more.

867
00:40:38,381 --> 00:40:41,483
There's still so many
more kids out there.

868
00:40:41,517 --> 00:40:43,785
Well, who says you can't?

869
00:40:43,819 --> 00:40:46,187
Listen, William, you were
a horrible history teacher

870
00:40:46,222 --> 00:40:48,556
and you were a worse
Spanish teacher.

871
00:40:48,591 --> 00:40:50,692
If you're going to be
of any good to anybody,

872
00:40:50,726 --> 00:40:52,360
you need to be
coaching a glee club.

873
00:40:52,395 --> 00:40:54,329
Which is why I got
you an interview

874
00:40:54,363 --> 00:40:56,843
for the open slot
at Carmel High.

875
00:40:57,133 --> 00:40:58,533
Vocal Adrenaline?

876
00:40:58,567 --> 00:41:02,304
Think of what you could
accomplish with a real budget.

877
00:41:02,338 --> 00:41:03,538
And without somebody like me

878
00:41:03,573 --> 00:41:05,240
constantly trying
to take you down?

879
00:41:05,274 --> 00:41:06,808
Wow.

880
00:41:06,842 --> 00:41:08,610
I mean, tha-that's
really amazing, Sue,

881
00:41:08,644 --> 00:41:10,512
but they're our mortal enemies.

882
00:41:10,546 --> 00:41:14,416
There is no "our"
anymore, William.

883
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:16,930
We're in the middle of
the new computer lab.

884
00:41:18,218 --> 00:41:20,698
You did what you could do here.

885
00:41:20,723 --> 00:41:22,624
And that was much more

886
00:41:22,658 --> 00:41:25,138
than I will ever care to admit.

887
00:41:26,829 --> 00:41:28,330
But it's really over.

888
00:41:29,932 --> 00:41:32,173
It's only an interview.

889
00:41:33,769 --> 00:41:36,010
You could always blow it.

890
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,714
Oh, God, that's awful.

891
00:41:45,748 --> 00:41:48,450
Yeah, that's why they
went out of business.

892
00:41:48,484 --> 00:41:50,285
I'll give you a minute.

893
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,424
(door closes)

894
00:41:58,594 --> 00:42:00,595
(sighs)

895
00:42:04,532 --> 00:42:07,612
RACHEL (echoes): <i> Being great at
something's going to change it.</i>

896
00:42:07,637 --> 00:42:09,717
<i>Being a part of something</i>
<i>special makes you</i>

897
00:42:09,739 --> 00:42:12,207
- <i>special, right?</i> - PUCK:<i> I was
tossing kids into Dumpsters.</i>

898
00:42:12,241 --> 00:42:13,875
ARTIE: <i> I had never
kissed a girl before.</i>

899
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:15,577
KURT: <i> I wasn't honest
about who I was.</i>

900
00:42:15,611 --> 00:42:17,379
Five...

901
00:42:17,413 --> 00:42:21,116
MERCEDES: <i> And Glee Club will
never end, Mr. Shue, because</i>

902
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,951
<i>you</i> are<i> Glee Club.</i>

903
00:42:24,744 --> 00:42:26,464
KURT:
<i>'Cause in this room</i>

904
00:42:26,489 --> 00:42:28,557
<i>it doesn't matter</i>
<i>if you're gay or straight.</i>

905
00:42:28,591 --> 00:42:29,791
<i>What matters is that</i>
<i>we're friends.</i>

906
00:42:29,825 --> 00:42:32,194
SANTANA:
<i>The struggle continues, but...</i>

907
00:42:32,228 --> 00:42:33,895
<i>at least I know I'm not alone.</i>

908
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:36,364
RACHEL: <i> If I'd let you down
when you needed me the most,</i>

909
00:42:36,399 --> 00:42:39,598
<i>I'd never forgive myself.</i>

910
00:42:39,632 --> 00:42:41,466
FINN: <i> We went around the
room and everybody said</i>

911
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,134
<i>what they wanted</i>
<i>to win this thing for,</i>

912
00:42:43,168 --> 00:42:44,736
<i>and we all said the same thing.</i>

913
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,504
<i>We want to win this for you.</i>

914
00:43:02,054 --> 00:43:04,022
(echoing chatter, laughing)

915
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:10,054
