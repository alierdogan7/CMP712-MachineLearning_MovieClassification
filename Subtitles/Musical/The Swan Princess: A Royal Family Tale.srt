an evil force, The Forbidden Arts,

00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:44,794
came to Earth from the underworld
through a magical crystal.

6
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:47,839
The crystal was his earthly domain

00:00:47,924 --> 00:00:51,259
from which he gained
his strength and power.

But one day, to his horror,

NARRATOR: But it also told
of a Glowing Stone

and warned the good creatures of the
Earth to keep it safely hidden,

19
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:47,607
for the stone would give evil
the power to withstand

was enraged to know

23
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,868

greater than his own,

The Forbidden Arts searched far

Her mere presence on Earth nearly
destroyed The Forbidden Arts.

would destroy the Swan Princess.

But Princess Odette
and Prince Derek together

The Forbidden Arts remained
tortured by this truth.

62
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:23,346
He alone could never
destroy the Swan Princess.

00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,313
Odette!

535
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,746
Be careful.
There are traps.

536
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:29,914
Okay.

537
00:37:48,976 --> 00:37:49,976
Odette!

538
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,352
I see it.

539
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,239
They're the real deal.

540
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:10,997
Fools! They failed again!

541
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:16,127
(GASPS) Watch out!

542
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:24,677
Derek.

543

(RUSTLING)

544
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:28,222
The Swan Princess.

545
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,724
Who...
Shh...

546
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:36,481
(GRUNTS)

547
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:39,859
What?

548
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:46,657
But I'm sure I hit the Prince!

549
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,659
Well, she must've gone on alone.

550
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:50,119
I'm going back to the village!

551
00:38:50,204 --> 00:38:53,414
Find him!
He couldn't have gone far.

552
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:58,377
I can't let her rescue the girl.

553
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:02,965
Who... What are you?

554
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:05,510
Oh, my gosh, I'm a little nervous.

555
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:08,095
Okay, now those are
two questions I intend

556
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:10,640
to answer with absolute
clarity, Princess.

557
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:12,600
But first, if you'll step aside,

558
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,977
I've just a few seconds
to save your husband's life.

559
00:39:15,062 --> 00:39:16,062
What?

560
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:21,859
A robust poison, indeed!

561
00:39:21,944 --> 00:39:23,027
Poison?

562
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,904
These guys know what
they're working with,

563
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:28,241
but they don't know who
they're dealing with. Me!

564
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:30,993
Okay, now, to your
first question, Princess.

565
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,872
I am a scullion. Order, Rodentia.
Family, Sciuridae or squirrel.

566
00:39:34,957 --> 00:39:39,418
Subfamily, Pteromyinae, or as we say
in the business, flying squirrel!

567
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,128
Please?

568
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:42,713
Ah, yes. Thank you.
Back to work.

569
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:46,509
However, we are a very,
very rare genus and species.

570
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:48,302
And I'll tell you
one thing we can do,

571
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,230
right here, right now,
and that's save lives.

572
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,059
In record time, I might add.

573
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,478
Look at that.
Look at those cheeks.

574
00:39:57,563 --> 00:40:00,523
Okay, I think it's coming back,
I think he's going to be okay.

575
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,733
Thank you.

576
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:04,944
Now, as to your second question.

577
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,613
I am your loyal servant,

578
00:40:07,698 --> 00:40:09,323
Bortan Gali Gali
Gumwatt Sumwatt Bing!

579
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:12,994
I'll just call you Scully,
if you don't mind.

580
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,497
Scully!
(LAUGHS) I see.

581
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:19,000
You're very charming, Majesty.

582
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:21,043
Thank you.
That's brilliant.

583
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:23,254
Your friends are trying to kill us!

584
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,715
Friends? Those are not friends.

585
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:28,884
I haven't spoken to
another scullion in years.

586
00:40:28,969 --> 00:40:30,094
I was banished.

587
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,345
Banished?

588
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:34,098
Yes. It's your fault, actually.

589
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:36,100
I'll tell you all about
it, if you want me to.

590
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:39,103
There's no time, Scully.
They've kidnapped Alise.

591
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,354
Who's that, your daughter?

592
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:42,273
Hopefully someday, yes.

593
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,358
You won't be fighting
just the scullions

594
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:46,485
to get her back,
I can promise you that.

595
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:49,614
You'll be fighting
The Forbidden Arts, as well.

596
00:40:49,698 --> 00:40:50,865
What?

597
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:55,411
If you succeeded, then
where are their bodies?

598
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:59,957
It's only a matter of time
before we find them, Master!

599
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,877
I want proof now.

600
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:07,590
You brought her here?

601
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:11,093
As proof that the plan worked.

602
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:15,931
She must never leave this place.

603
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:20,728
(SCREAMS)

604
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:31,447
Now, go back to the forest, find their
bodies and bring them back to me.

605
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:43,250
Mangler has been promised
your kingdom if...

606
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,169
If he would...

607
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,088
Yeah. And that other chap,
what's-his-name,

608
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,048
had been promised
the exact same thing.

609
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:52,510
You know who I'm talking about.
Rottweiler, Rothlisberger...

610
00:41:52,594 --> 00:41:54,595
Rothbart.
That's the one.

611
00:41:54,805 --> 00:41:56,055
Derek!

612
00:41:58,642 --> 00:42:02,228
So, we're up against
The Forbidden Arts again.

613
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:03,813
I don't know how to tell you this.

614
00:42:03,897 --> 00:42:07,775
There's no rescuing Alise.
It's impossible.

615
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:12,488
I made her a promise,
Scully, and I will keep it.

616
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:14,615
Well, of course, I mean impossible

617
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:16,701
for a non-Swan Princess person.

618
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:19,537
But for you, only next
to impossible. But still!

619
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:20,830
Say, "Ah!"

620
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:25,000
Ah... I'll find her.
Just show me the way to your village.

621
00:42:25,085 --> 00:42:27,128
Getting you into my village

622
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:30,881
would be a little like pushing an
elephant through a keyhole, I'm afraid.

623
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:34,301
No. No, that would...
How are you feeling? You dizzy?

624
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:35,636
Sleepy.

625
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:41,058
That's it! A sleeping potion!
That's how we'll do it!

626
00:42:41,143 --> 00:42:42,560
Do what?

627
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:45,855
Squeeze you through the keyhole.
(DISTANT SHOUTING)

628

also a friend of mine.

642
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:33,903
A thousand apologies.

643
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:35,863
You can come down,

644
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:40,701

in his eyes about my eyes.

00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:17,822
It's right on the tip of
the tongue of my brain.

654
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:20,032
It rings a bell of
some kind deep inside...

655
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:22,326
I'll tell you this much.
It's definitely got

656

something to do with the legend.

I don't know.

660
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,627
All I did was touch this image.

661
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:34,672

this image a dozen times!

Let's just say a lot.

663

because she's the Swan Princess.

664
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:46,141
Of course. That's it.
Why didn't I...

665
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:48,185
You really believe that I...

00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:04,989
Fact, orphans are alone!

710
00:47:05,073 --> 00:47:08,242
Fact, orphans love gingerbread!

711
00:47:11,121 --> 00:47:15,541
Fact, gingerbread villages
are exceedingly hard to make!

712
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:19,336
Ergo, the woman you call "evil"

713
00:47:19,421 --> 00:47:23,716
did a very nice thing
for lonely children!

714
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:26,176
Now I ask you...

715
00:47:26,261 --> 00:47:27,302
Sorry.

716
00:47:27,387 --> 00:47:29,596
Insufficient evidence.

717
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:33,642

Fling her! Fling her!

718
00:47:34,436 --> 00:47:35,644

721
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:51,285
I call the witness, Bridgit!

722

(LAUGHS)

723
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:58,834
Now, Bridgit, tell us
in your own words

724
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:04,256
how you know that the Swan
Princess is, indeed, good.

725
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,633
Okay. So,

726
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:11,346
this go back to time when knee
bone give me secret message.

727
00:48:11,473 --> 00:48:12,681
(ALL LAUGHING)

728
00:48:13,683 --> 00:48:16,518
It true! Me got special knee bone!

729
00:48:16,686 --> 00:48:19,188
It tell me when rain come!

730
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:21,315
What you say, knee bone?

731
00:48:21,483 --> 00:48:26,028
A stalling technique.
Well done, Rogers! Well done!

732
00:48:26,154 --> 00:48:31,533
By now, Derek has Alise, and he's
on his way back here to rescue us.

733
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:39,666
Okay, Princess, if you please,
a quick review of the plan.

734
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:44,963
Okay. As soon as Puffin, Speed and
Jean-Bob draw away those scullions,

735
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:47,341
Derek drinks this sleeping potion.

736
00:48:47,509 --> 00:48:50,010
The scullions find him,
think he's dead,

737
00:48:50,095 --> 00:48:51,970
then take him to their village.

738
00:48:52,055 --> 00:48:53,222
SCULLY: He's in.

739
00:48:53,348 --> 00:48:55,557
ODETTE: Derek's arrival
creates a diversion.

740
00:48:55,642 --> 00:48:57,893
You sneak in, find Alise...

741
00:48:57,977 --> 00:49:02,022
We give Derek this waking potion.
He and I rescue Alise. Voila.

742
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:05,484
And I'll keep
the Glowing Stone safe.

743
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:08,403
Questions? Concerns? Comments? Too late.
That's the plan.

744
00:49:08,488 --> 00:49:12,032
Yeah, right here, never slept
through a rescue before.

745
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:13,867
Through the lips
and close 'em tight.

746
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:15,702
Swallow it down and nighty night.

747
00:49:16,037 --> 00:49:18,539
Now, you're sure he
won't wake too soon?

748
00:49:18,665 --> 00:49:23,293
When it comes to potions, Highness,
these paws ain't faux pas. (CHUCKLES)

749
00:49:23,378 --> 00:49:26,505
Get it? Never mind.

750
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:31,301
I mixed the potion perfectly for
someone weighing 12-and-a-half stone.

751
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:35,013
I hope so.
I can't live without this guy.

752
00:49:35,098 --> 00:49:39,560
It'll all work out. So long as you
promise not to come into the village.

753
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:41,895
The Prince is spot on, Princess.

754
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:45,274
Every scullion has been trained
since childhood to destroy you.

755
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:46,942
To my fake death.

756
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,115
So, how long does it take to...

757
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:57,494
Faster than I anticipated.

758
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:15,596
I knew I hit him.

759
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,723
Mangler!

760
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:19,516
The one who banished you?

761
00:50:19,601 --> 00:50:20,809
Right.

762
00:50:29,152 --> 00:50:33,530
That's right, watch
guards, leave your posts.

763
00:50:34,824 --> 00:50:38,577
Okay, Princess, just need to round
off Derek's wake-up potion.

764
00:50:38,745 --> 00:50:40,037
You can use Puffin's eyes.

765
00:50:40,163 --> 00:50:41,455
Odette!

766
00:50:41,623 --> 00:50:44,458
No. To help spy in the village.

767
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:48,170
Great idea, Princess.

768
00:50:48,296 --> 00:50:50,464
Here. Extra antidote.

769
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:53,300
Just in case you end up on the wrong
end of a scullion poison dart.

Who knew?

772
00:50:57,388 --> 00:51:00,974
As my uncle would say, "Let's go."

773
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:02,517
Not an original thinker.

774
00:51:02,602 --> 00:51:05,687

was "Good morning."

All right. Mangler's making a
suspicious move at two o'clock.

779

I'd say that looks promising.

780

What if Scully can't find Alise?

781
00:51:42,642 --> 00:51:46,270

Don't touch it, Odette!

It'll be freaky, frozen
feeling, part two!

786
00:52:02,412 --> 00:52:07,040
I don't think so.
I think it's trying to tell me something.

787
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:08,208

that all along, didn't you?
