1
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,012
- Hard way, eight!
- Hard eight.

2
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,685
Here we go. Coming out.

3
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,939
- Shoot them.
- Here they go.

4
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,025
Come on, roll.

5
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:16,279
Here they go. We gotta roll.

6
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,366
Coming on out. There they go.

7
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,368
Mr. Swanson! Mr. Swanson!

8
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,537
Mr. Swanson, Lucky's got the dough!

9
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:25,955
- He's got it!
- Great.

10
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,250
It's like a miracle.
A dream coming true.

11
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,253
Good. Lucky always wanted
to race for himself.

12
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:36,549
He's supposed to meet me back here
in Los Angeles. Let's get it crated.

13
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,927
Not so fast now.
Lucky's your friend and partner...

14
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,388
...but I'm a plain,
ordinary businessman.

15
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:45,808
Until he shows up with the dough
that motor stays here.

16
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,768
But he's got the dough!

17
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:52,148
Look, Shorty. I can't deposit this
in my bank. It's the wrong color.

18
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:53,566
Hey, Swanny.

19
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,652
- That motor still for sale?
- Yes, Mr. Olson.

20
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,321
It's the last one I've got.

21
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,073
But you can't. Lucky's gonna buy it.

22
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:05,620
I told you, first guy walks in here
with the dough buys the motor.

23
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:11,918
- Who's the wild-eyed one?
- Lucky Jackson's mechanic.

24
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,503
I may be interested
in the motor as a spare.

25
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,340
I'm entering two cars
in the Las Vegas Grand Prix.

26
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:21,427
Operator. Operator!
Get me Las Vegas. Quick!

27
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,686
- Hey, you got room for me?
- Sure, drive right in.

28
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:34,607
Hey, boss. Here comes Lucky Jackson
with his entry.

29
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,362
All right, back her right in here.

30
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,114
Here we go. Bring it around a little.

31
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,791
That's quite a rig.

32
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,378
- I never saw anything like it.
- One of a kind. Built it myself.

33
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,380
- What'll she do?
- I don't know yet.

34
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,299
I'm on my way to Los Angeles
to pick up my motor.

35
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,801
- Be back tomorrow.
- Fine.

36
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,387
- I'd like to pay in advance.
- All right.

37
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,305
Thank you.

38
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,484
Well, what do you think of it,
Mr. Lucky Jackson?

39
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,654
Well, Elmo Mancini.

40
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,573
The Italian racing count.
How do you know me?

41
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:28,119
I went three times to watch you drive
at the Western Speedway.

42
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,913
- You're brilliant.
- Thanks, coming from the champion.

43
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,500
In Europe. Now I would like
to prove myself in your country.

44
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:39,338
Too bad you're going back to L.A.
I had a proposition to make to you.

45
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,756
- To me?
- Yes.

46
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,843
I admire the bravado
with which you drive...

47
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,886
...and I want you to drive for me.

48
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,889
- You're not driving in the Grand Prix?
- No, no.

49
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,850
I mean, I intend to win.

50
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,020
Now I get it.

51
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:57,857
You'll use my "bravado" to block
for you so you can get through.

52
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,442
I knew you were clever.

53
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:02,111
A couple things wrong
with your proposition:

54
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,573
I don't work for anybody.
I never run second to anybody.

55
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,616
And one small thing:

56
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,452
I intend to win.

57
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,706
You think you can beat both of us?

58
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,669
I'll try.
I'd like to see what you got.

59
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,087
Be my guest.

60
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:31,307
- You have made some changes.
- I got my little secrets.

61
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,184
Yeah, I can tell.

62
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,233
Can you help me, please?

63
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,111
Can we help you? Yes, ma'am.

64
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,239
I'd like you to check my motor.
It whistles.

65
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:48,991
I don't blame it.

66
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:53,412
- What did you say?
- Forgive my friend. He's very young.

67
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,415
We'll be very happy
to check your motor.

68
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,469
That's what I call a real sporty model.

69
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,305
I agree. A beautiful line.

70
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,938
- Count?
- Oh, yes.

71
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:23,109
That's how I started out,
working on sports cars.

72
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,993
- Well, no wonder!
- Well, is it serious?

73
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:36,038
She got a lucky break
when she stopped in here.

74
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:37,665
Oh, yes.

75
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,500
- Start her up, champ.
- Yeah.

76
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,135
Let her rip!

77
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,475
- I don't understand...
- I'll make it simple.

78
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,310
- Your motor's broken.
- Broke?

79
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,815
It was running perfectly when I pulled
up here, except for the whistle.

80
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:06,068
- Are you sure you're a mechanic?
- Sure I am.

81
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:09,238
We're gonna have to dismantle
this whole thing.

82
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:10,739
Completely.

83
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,533
- Might take a whole day.
- A day?

84
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:13,909
Maybe two.

85
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,497
Well, if you have to.

86
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,709
Can you lend me a car until you
have mine running again?

87
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:26,881
We'll do better. I'll be happy
to drive you wherever you want to go.

88
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,676
And why should you
go to all that bother?

89
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:35,014
Because here I'm known as
"your very bothering mechanic."

90
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,727
I'm sure you are.

91
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,354
Be right back.

92
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,362
I'm sorry.

93
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,381
You fixed it.

94
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,926
- You know what you've done?
- What?

95
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,596
We don't even know the girl's name.
Or do you?

96
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:20,226
- You could've seen her registration.
- I had no eyes for her registration.

97
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,645
- My eyes were...
- I know what they were on.

98
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,940
She might not even live here.
She could be a tourist.

99
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,651
Trust my instinct in these matters.

100
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,237
She could be in one of the shows.

101
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,781
But what difference does it make?

102
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,160
Unfortunately, you're on your way
to L.A. and I have to work on my car.

103
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,664
Therefore, we have no time
to search for a beautiful girl.

104
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,165
I guess you're right.

105
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,584
- Good luck to you.
- Good luck to you too.

106
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,382
I thought you were on your way
to Los Angeles.

107
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,052
The same way you were gonna
work on your motor. Remember?

108
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,013
Did you find her?

109
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,807
I haven't checked them all yet.

110
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,062
We'll find her if it takes all night.

111
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,496
- Shall we go in?
- Might as well.

112
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,165
"Welcome Sons of the Lone Star State."

113
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,709
Looks like they're having a good time.

114
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,087
What happened here?

115
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,427
- Boss, I've done the best...
- I know!

116
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:08,347
Go get yourself a drink! Or 10!

117
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,644
- Do you have a girl about so high?
- With legs incomparable?

118
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:17,439
I don't know what kind of girls I got,
but troubles, I got plenty!

119
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:18,941
When is the next show?

120
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,402
There isn't gonna be any show
until I get these crazy Sons...

121
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,530
Until I get them out of here!

122
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,075
You get the girls ready
to go on in 5 minutes. Count.

123
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,710
Fellow Texans!

124
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,922
Sons of the glorious Lone Star State.

125
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,218
Let's pay tribute to those
who've made Texas...

126
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,096
...the most glorious and proud
state of the union.

127
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,642
To the memory of noble Sam Houston!

128
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,937
To the one and only Davy Crockett!

129
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,107
John Wayne.

130
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,589
Bring out the girls.

131
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,885
Come to think of it, we never had
a girl that high, legs incomparable...

132
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:55,180
...but we got a gorgeous line
of Korean cuties.

133
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,313
"Trust my instincts in these matters."

134
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:06,441
I trusted your instinct.
Where did it get me? Nowhere.

135
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:07,901
To Texas.

136
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:10,112
It's not the end of the world.

137
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,114
Tonight is another night.

138
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:15,117
Tonight I'll be on my way
back to Los Angeles.

139
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,744
All right. Now, everybody line up.

140
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:21,123
Watch me.
Be sure you pay strict attention.

141
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,875
Watch me very closely.

142
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:27,587
Now, watch me.

143
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,297
Spread...

144
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,591
...step, step...

145
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,969
...swan...

146
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,305
...and push.

147
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:39,391
Count...

148
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,310
...I'm going to L.A. right now.
Can I borrow this?

149
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:46,148
You're going to take the guitar
all the way back to Los Angeles?

150
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,067
What for?

151
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,361
All right, let's try it. Get ready.

152
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,655
All right.

153
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,908
Come on. Don't be afraid.

154
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:58,660
Come on. Right out there.

155
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,746
Go! Go! Good.

156
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,916
Arms spread. Go ahead.

157
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:06,918
Very good!

158
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,756
There you go. All the way back.
That's right.

159
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,966
Good. Here come the winners.

160
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,677
Good for you.

161
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,682
Good morning.
I've been looking for you all night.

162
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:25,479
Really? You must be desperate
to find a motor that needs fixing.

163
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,899
What I really need
is a swimming lesson.

164
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,026
I'm through with lessons today.

165
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,820
- Great. Why don't we go out?
- I have other duties.

166
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:48,502
She loves me
She loves not

167
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,756
She loves me, she loves me
She loves me

168
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,802
The lady loves me
And it shows

169
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,722
In spite of the way
She turns up her nose

170
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,601
I'm her ideal
Her heart's desire

171
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:08,396
Under that ice
She's burning like fire

172
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,317
She'd like to cuddle up to me

173
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,237
She's playing hard to get

174
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:21,451
The lady loves me
But she doesn't know it yet

175
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,958
The gentlemen has savoir faire

176
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:31,878
As much as an elephant
Or a bear

177
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:37,759
I'd like to take him for a spin
Back to the zoo

178
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:39,761
To visit his kin

179
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:43,765
He's got about as much appeal

180
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,643
As a soggy cigarette

181
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:52,899
The lady loathes him
But he doesn't know it yet

182
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:59,281
The lady's got a crush on me

183
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:03,243
The gentlemen's crazy
Obviously

184
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:07,122
The lady's dying to be kissed

185
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,293
The gentlemen needs a psychiatrist

186
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:18,133
I'd rather kiss a rattlesnake
Or play Russian roulette

187
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:24,389
The lady loves me
But she doesn't know it yet

188
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:31,271
She's falling fast
She's on the skids

189
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,858
Both of his heads
Are flipping their lids

190
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:38,653
Tonight she'll hold me in her arms

191
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,866
I'd rather be holding hydrogen bombs

192
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:46,661
Will someone tell this Romeo

193
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,623
I'm not his Juliet

194
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:55,754
The lady loves me
But she doesn't know it yet

195
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:02,677
- She wants me
- Like poison ivy

196
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:06,723
- Needs me
- Like a hole in the head

197
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:13,521
- Anyone can see she's got it bad
- He's mad

198
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:22,572
- The gentleman is an egotist
- I'm simply aware I'm hard to resist

199
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:29,996
- He's one man I could learn to hate
- How's about having dinner at 8?

200
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:37,253
I'd rather dine with a Frankenstein
In a moonlight tete-a-tete

201
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:43,051
The lady loves me
But she doesn't know it yet

202
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:48,264
Oh, yes, she loves me

203
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:51,101
Dig that shrinking violet

204
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:59,442
- Oh, she really loves me
- Here's one gal you'll never get

205
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,072
She love, love, loves me

206
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,783
Would you like to make a bet?

207
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:12,205
I said the lady loves me

208
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:25,218
The gentleman's all wet

209
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,770
- You're using the wrong technique.
- No kidding.

210
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,790
Mr. Jackson?

211
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:59,210
- May I have a word with you, please?
- Sure.

212
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,879
What's the word?

213
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:04,049
The word, Mr. Jackson, is money.

214
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,427
You arrived with no luggage
and you charged...

215
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,555
- Hey, Lucky! Hey, partner!
- What're you doing here?

216
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:12,182
Didn't you get my message?

217
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,310
Swanson will sell the motor
unless we get him the money.

218
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,729
We're leaving now. Give me the bill.

219
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:21,399
- You fall in the pool or something?
- Long story.

220
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,905
Maybe you got it stashed in the room?

221
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:28,782
Some dame roll you?

222
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,951
Don't ponic pan... panic, partner.
I'll help you.

223
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:35,789
- It's no use. The money's gone.
- It is?

224
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,086
That's very good.

225
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:44,255
Good, Jimmy. Good, good, good.

226
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:49,094
Good. All right, that's enough.
You can join the others.

227
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,678
Very good.

228
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:55,183
- I was watching you teach. Very good.
- Thank you.

229
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:57,852
I've ordered lunch for us.
Will you join me?

230
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,605
Thank you so much,
but I'm on duty right now.

231
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:02,273
Too bad.

232
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:13,243
What's this?
Some kind of American joke?

233
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,329
No, it's not. He lost all our money.

234
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:22,043
That's not a tragedy, my friend.
Now you can drive for me.

235
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,881
Looks like we got a job here
for a long, long time, Count.

236
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,217
Serve him, Shorty.

237
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,974
Ma'am, would you like a lemonade
on the house?

238
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:38,309
I heard about your money.
I'm so sorry.

239
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:41,396
- It's only money.
- Only money?

240
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,399
Do you know how hard it is
to earn money?

241
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,527
- But I won it.
- Not win it, but make it.

242
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:52,907
Well, now that you've got me told,
how would you like to go out with me?

243
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:56,828
I'm a working girl.

244
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:01,291
Not tomorrow. I checked already.
I'm on the shift that gets off too.

245
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,294
And I got a whole day
to spend with you. So?

246
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,837
So all right.

247
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:10,216
- Meet me at the University of Nevada.
- You must be kidding.

248
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:14,762
What're they teaching you? How to
stack cards and deal from the bottom?

249
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:18,183
Rusty, I thought maybe
we could go dancing or something.

250
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:21,186
- Oh, you want to go dancing?
- Or something.

251
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:25,398
- Are you a good dancer?
- Try me.

252
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,611
That I will.

253
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:34,032
Meet me at the university gymnasium
tomorrow morning at 9:00...

254
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,076
...and we'll dance.

255
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:40,121
Or something.

256
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,354
Okay, kids, relax.

257
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,814
- Hi.
- Hi.

258
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,899
Do you want to join us?

259
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:52,443
If I'm caught, they'll take my license.

260
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,529
- You wanted to dance.
- Not here.

261
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:56,906
- Are you gonna chicken out?
- Yeah.

262
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,492
- Let's cut out of here.
- On one condition.

263
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:02,203
The kids are expecting you
to do something.

264
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:05,957
So if you don't want to dance, sing.
I know you can do that.

265
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,043
- Okay, but then we cut out, right?
- Right.

266
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:22,421
- This is fun.
- It's the only way to travel.

267
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,382
That's Hoover Dam.

268
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,469
One of the seven modern civil
engineering wonders of this century.

269
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,140
It's over 700 feet from the Colorado River
below to the top of the dam.

270
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:38,187
The dam helps make enough electricity
to light up homes 300 miles away.

271
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:41,482
Fly with Rusty Martin
and complete your education.

272
00:31:41,692 --> 00:31:44,193
I do sound like a guide.

273
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,822
Where are we going?

274
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,240
That way.

275
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,160
That's Lake Mead behind the dam.
Do you see it?

276
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,206
Continue, professor.

277
00:31:57,416 --> 00:32:00,585
All right. The lake has
550 miles of shoreline...

278
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:03,254
...and that's the marina
there ahead of us.

279
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:08,926
And there you can go
sailing, boating, fishing...

280
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,803
...swimming, water-skiing...

281
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:12,722
You said the magic word.

282
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,099
- I did?
- Yeah. Hang on, here we go.

283
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,342
- Where are you from, Rusty?
- Dubuque.

284
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:52,970
I've never been, but it's
interesting that you're from there.

285
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:57,892
Before you get too attached to Dubuque,
we moved there from Chillicothe, Ohio.

286
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:00,561
How about that.
I've never been there either.

287
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,855
Don't fall in love with Chillicothe.

288
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:06,484
Before that we lived in Helena,
Arkansas. On the Mississippi.

289
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,903
The Mississippi.
A great place to be born.

290
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:11,489
I wasn't.
I was born here in Las Vegas.

291
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:13,074
- You're putting me on?
- No.

292
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,076
- That's a coincidence.
- What?

293
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:19,080
You were born here, and after
all that traveling I met you here.

294
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:20,873
It must mean something.

295
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,919
All it means is my father came here
to work on the dam...

296
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,088
...and he liked it and he stayed.

297
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:28,923
We live right over here.

298
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,055
I sort of remember Las Vegas
was nothing much then.

299
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,516
A place where people came
to get married.

300
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:41,686
Came to get married.
Still do I guess.

301
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:45,564
I suppose. It's a thing
I'm not very much interested in.

302
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:51,028
Me neither. I guess you got big plans
for your future, haven't you?

303
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:58,035
You'll probably find it
very dull and commonplace...

304
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:01,622
...but I want to earn enough
to help my father buy a boat.

305
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,124
- A boat?
- Yes.

306
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:06,043
He runs a sightseeing boat
on the lake now.

307
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:11,716
My father's the kind of a man who
doesn't like to work for other people.

308
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:13,634
He wants to work for himself.

309
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:16,971
He's never had a chance to
because of taking care of me.

310
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,598
For a long time
it's been my father and me.

311
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:22,601
He's the kind of man
who likes to work for himself.

312
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,562
Sort of like me.

313
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,815
He's entirely different.
He's actually more like me...

314
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:31,277
...not crazy at all.
- Thank you.

315
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:34,655
- Honey?
- Dad.

316
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,575
- Can't I be a little bit crazy?
- Hi, Dad.

317
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:40,161
- Lucky, this is my father.
- Mr. Martin.

318
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:44,582
- Rusty's talked a lot about you.
- She has?

319
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:49,754
- I didn't think she'd mention me.
- I mentioned your losing your money.

320
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:51,255
Had a good day?

321
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:53,340
- Great. We...
- We went sightseeing.

322
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,260
- The usual things, you know.
- Yeah, sure.

323
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:02,683
You kids remember to eat lunch?

324
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,602
You didn't.

325
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,980
Come inside the apartment.
We'll throw something together.

326
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:11,192
Thanks, but I better
get the copter back.

327
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,488
You kids come in a copter?
Don't they cost 10 dollars a minute?

328
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,240
The guy running the field
is an Air Force buddy.

329
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,242
He still lets me order him around.

330
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:23,829
Well, I'd like to hear what
you have to say about race driving.

331
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:27,166
Come to think of it, if I were
younger, I'd take it up myself.

332
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:28,542
Father!

333
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,046
Take it up with your daughter.
She don't think it's safe.

334
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:37,551
Well, honey, I'll run along.
I promised old Jake Stiles I'd go bowling.

335
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:41,722
Father, stop torturing me.
I couldn't eat a thing.

336
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:52,399
- I never had a better day.
- Me too.

337
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,527
Let's don't let it end.

338
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,029
I'll go change.

339
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:12,878
I give

340
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:16,090
Give you my heart

341
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:25,891
Today, tomorrow and forever

342
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:33,232
You'll always be my love

343
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:43,409
I give

344
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:46,996
Give you my heart

345
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:56,547
Today, tomorrow and forever

346
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:05,556
You'll always be my love

347
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,811
You'll always be

348
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:16,108
My love

349
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:08,358
- Hello, Rusty.
- Pretty car. I love the color.

350
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:09,943
Thank you.

351
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,946
- You enjoy racing?
- I don't really know.

352
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:16,366
- I suppose you're very good.
- Well, I hope I am.

353
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:18,577
Is Lucky good?

354
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:20,495
He's the best since Cal Howard.

355
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:22,915
Cal Howard? Is he the champion?

356
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,292
He would have been,
but he had bad luck.

357
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,962
- What do you mean?
- His car crashed over a wall.

358
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:35,135
So, as you see, the good thing to do
is to avoid bad luck.

359
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:37,429
I guess so.

360
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:40,933
- What are you talking about?
- Rusty was asking...

361
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:43,393
We were just discussing
cars and drivers.

362
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:46,104
- Let's go for a ride.
- You got the motor?

363
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,648
You better believe it.

364
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,316
You do?

365
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:52,653
This way.

366
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:59,660
Okay, now I'm gonna downshift
and bring her up 5700 revs.

367
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:02,621
- What does that mean?
- We're going into a turn.

368
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,000
Hey, okay.

369
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:10,629
Here's my shift point.
Watch me burn up the guy ahead.

370
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:13,966
- Why?
- Because we gotta win, that's why.

371
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:27,145
Just a few more hundred of these
and I'll be racing again.

372
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:28,563
Someday.

373
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:32,025
Someday you'll get smashed up
just like Cal Howard.

374
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,862
How did you know about that?

375
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:40,867
Oh, look. He was just unlucky,
that's all.

376
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:45,163
- It's just one of those things.
- Unlucky. That's what everybody says.

377
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:51,211
Honey, I just don't understand this
part of you. I really don't.

378
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:54,047
What do you mean "this part of me"?
It is me.

379
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:56,216
Try to understand, it is me.

380
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,513
Then you've got to understand me.

381
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:06,393
When I get married...

382
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:09,521
...I want a little white house...

383
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,733
...with a tree in the front yard.

384
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:14,526
A real kind of tree...

385
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:16,028
...with green leaves...

386
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:17,571
Oh, that.

387
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,532
When I get the money,
we can have 100 trees...

388
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,994
...a big white house with a four-car
garage and everything.

389
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:27,539
- By then I'll be the champ.
- I don't want you to be champ.

390
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:31,293
I know that every cent
you get your hands on...

391
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:34,713
...you'll gamble away,
because it's that motor you want.

392
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:36,590
The Grand Prix. Any race.

393
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:39,551
Any fool would know...

394
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:41,553
...you won't change.

395
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:46,725
Not for anybody.

396
00:44:57,028 --> 00:45:00,530
Well, what are you doing home
this time of day, honey?

397
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,784
- You feel all right?
- I never felt better in my life.

398
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,745
Oh, sure. Of course. I can see that.

399
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:09,456
Is it so unusual for a girl
to come home...

400
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:12,959
...because she's sick of the hotel
and all the people in it?

401
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:16,797
Is it so unusual for a girl
to want a little peace and quiet?

402
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:20,467
You answer it and if it's anybody,
I won't speak to him.

403
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:34,648
- Yeah?
- For Miss Rusty Martin.

404
00:45:36,818 --> 00:45:39,694
- A tree?
- Yeah, a tree.

405
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:44,282
- You want that I put it inside?
- No, you better not.

406
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:46,451
It's pretty outdoorsy.

407
00:45:46,828 --> 00:45:48,078
Thanks.

408
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:52,833
- Come here.
- I'm not interested.

409
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:56,128
It's not that anybody
you didn't want to see.

410
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:59,464
It's something he sent you.
A little posy.

411
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:02,509
It should be obvious
I'm completely indifferent...

412
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,719
...to anything he might give...

413
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:08,265
It's a tree. Daddy, it's a tree!

414
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:09,683
It sure is.

415
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:12,018
Oh, I've wronged him.

416
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:15,480
- I've wronged him terribly.
- Sure you have.

417
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:19,526
The things I said, what I did.
I'm so sorry.

418
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:24,698
All I could do is say so.
From the bottom of my heart.

419
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:31,496
You know, Mr. Tree...

420
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:35,000
...we may have a big celebration
come Christmas.

421
00:46:35,168 --> 00:46:38,044
You and I can both get lit up.

422
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:43,550
Lucky! Lucky!

423
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:47,554
Oh, I'm sorry. It's not you.

424
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,850
Rusty!

425
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,727
- Oh, hi.
- Hi, Rusty.

426
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:57,772
If you're free, why don't we have
a quiet dinner in my suite?

427
00:46:58,024 --> 00:47:00,859
No, I couldn't. Not after the tree.

428
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:02,235
Tree?

429
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:09,743
- What are you doing?
- Hi, Lucky, baby.

430
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:12,078
You're supposed to be working.

431
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:14,873
I'm not a waiter anymore,
and neither are you.

432
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:18,460
The Italian champ couldn't stand us
being waiters...

433
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:21,588
...so he paid off our debt
to this joint. We're free.

434
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:24,424
You must be out of your mind.
We don't want to...

435
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:32,766
Help yourself, ladies.

436
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,310
Lucky, I've got to talk to you.

437
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,729
Stop helping.
Mind your own business.

438
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:40,065
What are you talking about?

439
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:45,487
I know. Even if you win,
it won't be enough for a motor.

440
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:48,240
With a cash prize,
I could win enough for it.

441
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,909
You can take your darn tree back!

442
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:52,953
Tree again? What's this tree?

443
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:55,163
- I need a tree like a...
- Hold on!

444
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:56,581
You can't do that!

445
00:47:56,791 --> 00:48:00,252
Look, Rusty, I could use the money
I'm going to win.

446
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:03,964
Win? What makes you so sure
you're going to win?

447
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:07,634
- I'm in the contest too.
- Go ahead. Try to win. I don't care.

448
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:11,012
- That's exactly what I'm going to do.
- That's fine.

449
00:48:11,264 --> 00:48:13,807
- I hope you lose!
- Thanks!

450
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,101
See what you started?

451
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:22,607
- Didn't you ask me to dinner?
- Yes, of course.

452
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:24,025
All right!

453
00:48:26,988 --> 00:48:28,863
- Francois!
- Yes, maitre.

454
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:32,117
You'll serve Count Mancini
in his suite, as you know.

455
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,994
And discreetly.

456
00:48:34,996 --> 00:48:36,288
Discreetly.

457
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:39,165
When you have finished serving,
vanish.

458
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:43,378
Because at this moment, musicians
take their places behind the screen...

459
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:47,757
...and romantic Italian melodies
provide an atmosphere of...

460
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:53,263
You see, the count is dining
a deux with the beautiful...

461
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:56,308
...manager of our pool.

462
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:02,314
Hey, Frankie. Frankie.

463
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:04,649
Can you be bought?

464
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,988
You look lovely tonight.

465
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:11,656
Thank you.

466
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:14,367
They're beautiful.

467
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:17,787
Just beautiful.
I've never had a whole spray before.

468
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:19,372
Thank you.

469
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:25,003
I've always seen your hair
in bright sunlight.

470
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:27,839
I thought it was the loveliest thing
I'd seen.

471
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:32,344
But by candlelight it's softer.
Even more beautiful.

472
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:36,556
- Yes, now back to our conversation.
- Conversation?

473
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,517
That we had today.
About the racing and drivers?

474
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:43,104
Yes, our conversation,
Let's talk about you first.

475
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:45,398
- Good evening, folks.
- Oh, no.

476
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:47,734
Thought you'd like
something to gnaw.

477
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:50,528
Potato chips and champagne
don't go together.

478
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:52,405
Count, they're my favorite.

479
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,075
These candles smell funny.

480
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,371
You don't need them.
It's bright outside.

481
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:02,707
Yes, now,
what we were talking about.

482
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:05,919
- Why do you drive in the Grand Prix?
- I want to win.

483
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,755
- It's my first U.S. Race.
- I don't understand...

484
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:12,300
Don't try to explain to her
because she won't understand.

485
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:14,135
You won't understand,
will you, baby?

486
00:50:14,387 --> 00:50:16,096
- Don't call me baby.
- Okay, baby.

487
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:18,848
Should I open the count, pop?
Pop, count?

488
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:21,935
- If you know how.
- There's a first for everything.

489
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:23,353
You had champagne?

490
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,480
Certainly, hundreds of times.

491
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:28,108
When my friend Pauline got married...

492
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:31,111
...and when I was 18
my father and I split a split.

493
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:33,113
You were asking why I race?

494
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:36,241
It is because racing cars
have always been my hobby.

495
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:40,286
I'm a wealthy man and have nothing
to spend my money on that matters.

496
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,871
Oh, that's sad.

497
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:45,959
But if I met a girl I could love,
I'd gladly give up my hobby.

498
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,961
Keep my cars as toys.

499
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:50,630
Let Lucky drive them.
He's a very fine driver.

500
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,757
But a miserable waiter.

501
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,260
Soup.

502
00:51:00,433 --> 00:51:01,766
You'd give up racing?

503
00:51:02,435 --> 00:51:04,811
For the girl I love? Oh, yes.

504
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,523
We haven't finished.

505
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:11,484
It was cold when it spilled
on my hand. It's bad.

506
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:17,198
Somebody I know wouldn't give up
racing. For a girl or for anything.

507
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,909
- I like how you think.
- Thank you.

508
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:22,954
It sounds very attractive
and so reasonable.

509
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,333
This catfish don't look too healthy.

510
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:29,419
It's furry around the edges.

511
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,713
Bring us another order then.

512
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:36,676
If you're gonna get her primed,
I better open this.

513
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:39,012
- How dare you!
- I gotta open it.

514
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,181
I feel it in my heart, Rusty.

515
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:45,018
There's a time in life
when a man must put away his toys...

516
00:51:45,186 --> 00:51:47,937
...and get on to
the serious business of living.

517
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:49,522
Definitely.

518
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:52,317
I agree with you thoroughly.

519
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,861
It's a pleasure
to hear a man's opinion...

520
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:58,865
...and not have to listen
to a stubborn boy who won't grow up...

521
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:03,161
That's too much.
Where's my regular waiter?

522
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:04,954
You don't want me?

523
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,665
No. Anybody but you.

524
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:12,045
Okay. Take it easy with the pop
because I want you in top shape...

525
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:14,547
...when you lose that talent contest.

526
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:17,175
Leave it alone.
Just get out.

527
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,968
Okay, I'm going. I'm going.

528
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,595
Bye.

529
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,561
Oh, no. Get out.

530
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:31,231
Just get out. Leave it.

531
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:33,608
- Get out.
- Come on. He wants to be alone.

532
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:38,071
I'm sorry. I didn't expect our dinner
to turn into a farce.

533
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:39,739
That's all right.

534
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:49,249
- Music for you.
- It's beautiful.

535
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,084
Just beautiful.

536
00:53:03,556 --> 00:53:05,598
Now I feel at home again.

537
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:11,271
I can almost believe
we are in my villa...

538
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,274
...outside of Naples.

539
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,070
It lies up in the hills.

540
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:24,951
The air is so soft.

541
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:32,792
- It warms a man's blood.
- It's air-conditioned here.

542
00:53:34,587 --> 00:53:37,130
Flowers tumble over the wall.

543
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:41,092
Everything's in bloom.

544
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:44,804
You mustn't judge all America
by Las Vegas...

545
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:49,142
...because Las Vegas is in the desert
and it's the summertime now.

546
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:53,897
If you think I don't need you
Take a look at my eyes

547
00:53:54,607 --> 00:53:58,651
Baby, these ain't raindrops
Falling out of the sky

548
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:03,323
Since you've been gone
I've been so alone

549
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:08,536
If you think I don't need you
Then, baby, you're wrong

550
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:12,999
If you think I don't love you
What could I do

551
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:17,879
To prove to you, baby
My love is true

552
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:22,634
I sing the same old song
Since you've been gone

553
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:27,555
Since you've been gone
I've been so alone

554
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:33,102
If you think I don't need you
Baby you're wrong

555
00:54:34,647 --> 00:54:38,524
I hate to break this up, but
we'll be late for the contest, baby.

556
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,693
- Don't call me...
- Baby.

557
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,407
Do you understand
what I tried to say?

558
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:48,868
What you tried to say
sounds attractive.

559
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:51,496
Thank you. Good luck in the contest.

560
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,373
I think I need it.

561
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:57,418
I was just... Yeah.

562
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:24,821
Wonderful.

563
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:27,615
You know our chef, Karl,
and his lovely wife...

564
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:31,577
...who will be appearing in the kitchen
to pay for the broken dishes.

565
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,955
Here's a real treat,
fellow employees.

566
00:55:34,123 --> 00:55:37,291
A lady who comes to us
direct from a sensational run...

567
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:41,963
...around our swimming pool.
Our very clever pool manager...

568
00:55:42,131 --> 00:55:44,841
...let's make her welcome.
Lovely Rusty Martin.

569
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:46,592
Let's bring Rusty out.

570
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,551
We're really way up there!

571
00:59:57,761 --> 01:00:00,096
Looks like you're the winner so far.

572
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,265
And now, fellow employees...

573
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:06,560
...here is America's foremost waiter,
but he may be tomorrow's maitre d'.

574
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,813
Let's welcome from amongst you...

575
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:10,898
...Lucky Jackson.

576
01:00:17,072 --> 01:00:19,699
Bright-light city gonna set my soul

577
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:22,702
Gonna set my soul on fire

578
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:26,289
Got a whole lot of money
That's ready to burn

579
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:29,208
So get those stakes up higher

580
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:33,045
There's a thousand pretty women
Waiting out there

581
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:36,549
And they're all living
Devil-may-care

582
01:00:36,717 --> 01:00:39,844
And I'm just a devil
With love to spare

583
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:46,017
So viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas

584
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:49,770
How I wish that there were more

585
01:00:49,938 --> 01:00:52,606
Than the 24 hours in the day

586
01:00:53,275 --> 01:00:59,238
Even if there were 40 more
I wouldn't sleep a minute away

587
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:03,075
Oh, there's blackjack and poker
And the roulette wheel

588
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:06,329
A fortune won and lost on every deal

589
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:09,707
All you need's a strong heart
And a nerve of steel

590
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:15,671
Viva Las Vegas

591
01:01:16,882 --> 01:01:19,508
Viva Las Vegas with your neon flashing

592
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:24,096
And your one-arm bandits crashing
All those hopes down the drain

593
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:27,933
Viva Las Vegas turning day
Into nighttime

594
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,810
Turning night into daytime

595
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:33,939
If you see it once
You'll never be the same again

596
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:39,779
I'm gonna keep on the run
I'm gonna have me some fun

597
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:42,573
If it costs me my very last dime

598
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:46,410
If I wind up broke up
Well, I'll always remember

599
01:01:46,578 --> 01:01:49,246
That I had a swinging time

600
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:53,000
I'm gonna give it
Everything I've got

601
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:56,420
Lady Luck, please let the dice stay hot

602
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:59,715
Let me shout a seven with every shot

603
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:09,433
Viva Las Vegas

604
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:39,672
Viva, viva Las Vegas

605
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:49,765
That was wonderful, wasn't it?
Let's see what the meter says.

606
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:51,434
It's right up there!

607
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:53,686
Looks like we got ourselves a tie.

608
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:59,233
Rusty, come on out, honey.

609
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:03,112
And Lucky. Lucky Jackson.

610
01:03:04,406 --> 01:03:07,116
You kids were wonderful.
You were dynamite.

611
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:10,202
Let's decide who the winner is
Las Vegas-style.

612
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:11,996
I'll flip a silver dollar.

613
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:14,707
Ladies first.
Would you pick a toss, Rusty?

614
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:17,751
- Heads.
- Heads. Okay, here we go.

615
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:19,336
Tails.

616
01:03:19,546 --> 01:03:21,338
He didn't toss it high enough.

617
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:24,467
Looks like the winner
is Lucky Jackson!

618
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:27,636
We did it! We got the motor!
We did it, baby!

619
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:31,307
Of course, we do have
a second prize for Miss Martin.

620
01:03:31,475 --> 01:03:33,225
Take a look here.

621
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:36,228
How about that?
Not the girls, they go with me.

622
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:39,482
But here, for you,
is a genuine, regulation-size...

623
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:41,233
...beautiful pool table.

624
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:44,320
Here's a wonderful evening of fun
for the family.

625
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:46,780
Mom, Pop and the kiddies.
How about that?

626
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,742
I never expected anything
so beautiful or so big.

627
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:52,912
I'm very happy. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

628
01:03:53,914 --> 01:03:55,831
And now, the first prize.

629
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:58,751
First prize. Here we go.

630
01:03:58,919 --> 01:04:00,336
Lucky, this is yours.

631
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:03,339
This beautiful silver trophy
is all yours.

632
01:04:03,507 --> 01:04:07,676
You hold it for one year and next year
you hand it to next year's winner.

633
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:11,263
Wait a minute.
That's not all. That's not all.

634
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:13,140
You also receive...

635
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:15,100
Money. Money.

636
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:19,647
...an all-expense paid...

637
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:23,150
...two weeks' honeymoon!
Right here in fabulous Las Vegas!

638
01:04:23,318 --> 01:04:24,568
How about that?

639
01:04:24,778 --> 01:04:26,529
Oh, no.

640
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:30,115
- Just one more.
- Just one more.

641
01:04:30,325 --> 01:04:32,952
Very good. That's all, kids,
thanks very much.

642
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:35,287
- Congratulations.
- Nice going, Lucky.

643
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:38,707
- Thank you.
- Ask her, Lucky. Go ahead, ask her.

644
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:40,626
Rusty?

645
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:45,673
I'll trade you this honeymoon for your
pool table because you don't need it.

646
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,716
I don't need a honeymoon.

647
01:04:47,926 --> 01:04:49,552
Besides, I love it.

648
01:04:49,803 --> 01:04:52,096
It's got a lot of practical uses.

649
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:55,641
She won't loosen up with it.
She can sell it, same as you.

650
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,228
There's no sense in trying.

651
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:01,313
We lost our motor.

652
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:05,693
I think I'll go jump over the dam
and take this with me.

653
01:05:12,826 --> 01:05:15,911
Excuse me, folks. It's rescue time.

654
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:50,923
I need somebody

655
01:06:52,092 --> 01:06:54,259
Won't that somebody

656
01:06:55,428 --> 01:07:01,809
Please, please listen to my plea?

657
01:07:04,813 --> 01:07:07,439
Need that somebody

658
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:11,860
Won't that somebody

659
01:07:13,488 --> 01:07:18,367
Come running to me?

660
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:26,333
I need somebody to lean on

661
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:34,800
I'm tired of being unhappy

662
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:37,469
And so blue

663
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:41,640
If she came, I would hold her

664
01:07:43,143 --> 01:07:48,230
Because I need that shoulder
To lean on

665
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:52,317
Yes, I really do

666
01:07:55,864 --> 01:07:58,157
I need somebody

667
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:05,748
And, baby, that somebody is you

668
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:52,628
- Hey, buddy. You seen Shorty?
- Nope.

669
01:08:52,796 --> 01:08:56,131
I can't find him. Looks like
he ran out. Took my car too.

670
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,815
No, that's not the way I want it.

671
01:09:15,944 --> 01:09:17,903
Okay, Mancini. You win.

672
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:20,906
- You'll drive for me?
- No, I'll work on your car.

673
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:24,326
Okay. You work on my car,
I'll work on your girl.

674
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:27,579
You mind if I watch?

675
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:31,208
I always wanted to take a look at one,
see how they've changed.

676
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:33,335
But of course, Mr. Martin.

677
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:37,172
- Lucky will explain everything to you.
- Well, thanks.

678
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,635
Sure. If it's all right
with your daughter.

679
01:09:41,845 --> 01:09:44,930
What has she got to say about it?
What are these?

680
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:46,682
That's a carburetor.

681
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:49,017
There are three here.
The only change...

682
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:50,644
Three?

683
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:53,188
Well, Father.

684
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:56,525
I thought you were going fishing.

685
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:58,777
I'm practically on my way.

686
01:09:58,987 --> 01:10:00,737
Then you can take me with you.

687
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:03,866
Anybody who would marry this girl
is a fool.

688
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:06,535
Hey, Lucky! Lucky!

689
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:08,412
Everybody! Look!

690
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:12,374
I got the motor!
Wait'll you see her! She's a beauty!

691
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:14,209
- We got it?
- Yes! She's ours!

692
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:15,627
We got it!

693
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:18,130
- Did you do this?
- Save your gratitude.

694
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:20,257
Why should I do it?

695
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,718
- Did you do it, Rusty?
- Me?

696
01:10:22,886 --> 01:10:25,262
You think I'd have any part
of this thing?

697
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:27,514
Stop being a detective.
Get to work.

698
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:30,809
You think you can have it running
by midnight? It's noon.

699
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:32,269
- We can.
- You bet.

700
01:10:32,437 --> 01:10:34,521
- If you need help, I'll...
- Father!

701
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:37,900
Honey, why don't you go fishing?
The fishing is good.

702
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:39,359
We need a chain pull.

703
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:42,654
Mr. Martin, an N wrench.
The torque wrench, Shorty.

704
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:44,239
On the double!

705
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:46,241
- We haven't got much time.
- Here.

706
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:48,160
- N wrench.
- Beautiful.

707
01:10:48,328 --> 01:10:49,411
It's not an N wrench.

708
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:16,355
Does he love me most
Or love my rival?

709
01:11:18,066 --> 01:11:21,193
Does he love my rival
More than me?

710
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:26,573
When the weekend comes
He's with my rival

711
01:11:28,076 --> 01:11:31,244
Yes, he's with my rival constantly

712
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:37,709
And all through the week
My competition gets the praise

713
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:40,712
That style, that pep, that body line

714
01:11:41,381 --> 01:11:46,259
There was a time when he praised mine

715
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:50,389
He's not fooling me
He's with my rival

716
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:53,725
And I know right where they are

717
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:56,103
He's carrying things too far

718
01:11:56,938 --> 01:12:01,274
My rival is a baby-blue racing car

719
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:06,571
I could be the senorita
Or a lady of fame

720
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:09,741
A gold digger with a crazy figure

721
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:11,868
Beat her at her own game

722
01:12:12,203 --> 01:12:14,746
I'll make you a bet
I'd make him forget

723
01:12:14,914 --> 01:12:16,957
A hostess on jet
A sexy brunette

724
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:19,459
A model from Paris
A wealthy heiress

725
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:22,004
A chick who's a gas
Or a graduate of Vassar

726
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:26,258
A socialite who's out all night
A famous movie star

727
01:12:26,801 --> 01:12:28,760
A debutante
Or Charlie's aunt

728
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:31,013
A golfer who shoots par

729
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:33,765
Can't compare the female gender

730
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:36,226
With a spare or with a fender

731
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:39,813
Rev it up and listen to it roar

732
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:45,777
While I watch the clock
And walk the floor

733
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:52,534
He's not fooling me
He's with my rival

734
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:56,997
And I know right where they are

735
01:12:57,165 --> 01:12:59,458
He's carrying things too far

736
01:13:00,043 --> 01:13:06,173
My rival is a baby-blue racing car

737
01:13:29,864 --> 01:13:32,115
- Wheel's okay.
- Right.

738
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:36,745
Father, I brought you some food.
If he'll allow you to eat it.

739
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:38,997
Sorry, Pop. Why don't you take five.

740
01:13:39,207 --> 01:13:41,124
Five what? Five days?

741
01:13:41,334 --> 01:13:43,001
Get this junk out of here.

742
01:13:43,211 --> 01:13:46,588
This junk happens to be nourishment
for my father.

743
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:50,383
Do you really think your junk
will be ready for midnight?

744
01:13:50,593 --> 01:13:53,595
If you came to talk,
you're wasting everybody's time.

745
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:56,598
If you want to help,
put these on and get to work.

746
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:58,683
All right.

747
01:13:58,893 --> 01:14:00,268
I will.

748
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:06,775
Hurry up and get me a wrench.

749
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:08,235
What wrench?

750
01:14:08,402 --> 01:14:10,278
Over there in the tool case.

751
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:17,244
Yeah, sure.

752
01:14:30,091 --> 01:14:33,718
Don't touch anything
unless I tell you, please.

753
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:36,721
Where's the cord?

754
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:50,652
Put that plug back in!

755
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:55,115
Will you stop crossing the wires?
You're liable to blow us up!

756
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:58,827
Let me put you
where you won't bother us.

757
01:14:59,036 --> 01:15:03,039
Mr. Martin, will you get the girl out
before she louses up the race?

758
01:15:03,249 --> 01:15:05,333
Honey, go fishing. Make him happy.

759
01:15:05,543 --> 01:15:09,296
She's plain ignorant. Let her
stick around. She'll learn something.

760
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:12,048
- Where's the gun?
- What does he need a gun for?

761
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:17,012
- To shoot you if you don't move.
- No, a grease gun, honey. Over there.

762
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,264
- Is this it?
- Yeah!

763
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:23,059
I'm sorry. If we went fishing,
none of this would have happened.

764
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:24,811
Give me the gun.

765
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:29,357
Oh, no.

766
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:33,528
Daughters.

767
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:36,031
Attention in the pit and garage area.

768
01:15:36,199 --> 01:15:39,284
Let's get all the cars
to the starting grid now.

769
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:41,620
A few are missing.
Let's bring them up.

770
01:15:53,007 --> 01:15:57,552
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to the first Las Vegas Grand Prix.

771
01:15:58,012 --> 01:16:01,848
We'll have TV cameras along
the circuit to bring you this coverage.

772
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:04,559
Also, we'll be in communication
by telephone.

773
01:16:04,769 --> 01:16:08,396
Making his first appearance in this
country is Count Mancini.

774
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:13,485
It won't start!

775
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,243
- We did it!
- We did it!

776
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:24,079
- Get them, Lucky!
- That's the idea.

777
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:27,749
At this time,
we have not seen Lucky Jackson.

778
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,128
We have gotten word that they're working
frantically to get this car ready.

779
01:16:32,505 --> 01:16:33,838
Come on, let's push it!

780
01:16:34,048 --> 01:16:36,424
Come on, let's push it. Push!

781
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:40,011
- We got it.
- I found the copter to fly the crew!

782
01:16:40,179 --> 01:16:42,305
- What crew?
- You, your dad and me.

783
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:44,724
- Yeah, me.
- Come on, let's go!

784
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:46,434
- Come on, Lucky!
- Get them!

785
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,853
Get them, Lucky! Good luck!

786
01:16:49,063 --> 01:16:51,231
Here comes Lucky Jackson now.

787
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:55,151
This is a real thriller.
We didn't think he'd make it...

788
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:59,447
...but they're bringing his car up now
and he will be in the race.

789
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:03,451
This course will be around
Hoover Dam, Mount Charleston...

790
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:06,162
...and various points
throughout the desert.

791
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:08,039
Attention all drivers.

792
01:17:08,249 --> 01:17:11,084
Will you go to your
starting positions now, gentlemen?

793
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:16,631
We'll start our countdown as soon
as the drivers take their positions.

794
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:19,592
- It looks like they're there.
- Ten, nine, eight...

795
01:17:19,802 --> 01:17:21,636
...seven, six...

796
01:17:21,804 --> 01:17:23,054
...five...

797
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:25,807
...four, three...

798
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:28,560
...two, one.

799
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:24,032
Come on, let's go. Rusty, come on.

800
01:18:28,287 --> 01:18:31,915
- Hurry! Come on!
- Sit back! Put your seat belt on.

801
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:40,382
It's 6:10 a.m.

802
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:43,009
Right now,
they're approaching Hoover Dam.

803
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:46,012
Everybody coming through
in apparently good order.

804
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:50,058
As the cars come over the dam,
a beautiful sight to see.

805
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:18,039
Come on! Come on!

806
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:29,253
Come on!

807
01:23:31,507 --> 01:23:32,840
Come on, Lucky!

808
01:23:46,313 --> 01:23:48,856
We did it! We did it!

809
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:53,444
You made a good investment when you
brought the money for that motor...

810
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:02,620
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

811
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:05,248
- Send me a card. I'll miss you.
- Right, partner.

812
01:24:05,416 --> 01:24:06,791
Take good care of her.

813
01:24:08,127 --> 01:24:10,795
Bright-light city gonna set my soul

814
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:13,673
Gonna set my soul on fire

815
01:24:14,425 --> 01:24:17,427
Got a whole lot of money
That's ready to burn

816
01:24:17,636 --> 01:24:20,304
So get those stakes up higher

817
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:24,225
There's a thousand pretty women
Waiting out there

818
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:27,478
And they're all living
Devil-may-care

819
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:30,898
And I'm just a devil with love to spare

820
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:33,651
So viva Las Vegas

821
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,501
