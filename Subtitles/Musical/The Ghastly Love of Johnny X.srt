00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,229
Kill the engine, chuckles.

360
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:33,864
( Engine stops )

361
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:38,602
Gosh.

362
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:41,572
I used to see
double-features here.

363
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:45,209
I've never seen a picture show
at the drive-in.

364
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:47,745
You haven't?

365
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:50,748
Almost all of these
babies are gone,

366
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:54,752
just like the buffalo
and the 35-cent hamburger.

367
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:57,154
I can't believe you've never
been to a drive-in.

368
00:25:57,156 --> 00:26:00,257
I have, just not for the show.

369
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,663
I thought I told you
to kill that engine.

370
00:26:05,665 --> 00:26:07,064
I'm sorry.

371
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,900
I've never done anything
like that before.

372
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:13,737
I've never done anything
like any of this before.

373
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:19,009
Well, I have, more times
than you can imagine,

374
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:21,912
and it always
comes out the same way.

375
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,315
I'm sorry.

376
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:38,996
So who are those punks
and what do they want?

377
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:40,931
You don't wanna know.

378
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,934
I think I should know, now that
I'm on their must-hit list.

379
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:49,239
They call themselves
"The Ghastly Ones."

380
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:51,342
The Ghastly Ones?

381
00:26:51,344 --> 00:26:53,611
What are they, musicians?

382
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:56,313
Not quite.

use your help.

The Ghastly love of Johnny X.

Him again?

428
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,862
What's he got
that I haven't got?

00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:02,432
And what makes that creep so

Johnny comes from a

He was powerful, even there.

432
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:16,146
One day he came to us
with this dastardly device.

433
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,515
He called it
the resurrection suit.

434
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:22,319
When he put on that suit
he could control anyone,

435

to receive the frequency

me out of the car?

But, all he had was a glove.

449
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:59,957

do nasty things with one hand.

01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:47,715
( Singsong fluttering )

1247
01:14:47,717 --> 01:14:49,550
Flying saucer!
You seem skeptical.

1248
01:14:49,552 --> 01:14:50,952
Skeptical?

1249
01:14:50,954 --> 01:14:52,553
Au contraire, moped.

1250
01:14:52,555 --> 01:14:55,022
I'm one of the few
living talk show hosts

1251
01:14:55,024 --> 01:14:56,858
who's actually been abducted.

1252
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:58,826
I spent several weeks with
the little fellows.

1253
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:01,529
They even took
a stab at impregnating me.

1254
01:15:01,531 --> 01:15:03,664
Fun, but fruitless.

1255
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:05,066
You held your ground.

1256
01:15:05,068 --> 01:15:07,001
Among other things, yes.

1257
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:08,836
Whatever do you mean?

1258
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:11,005
I'll show you later.

1259
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:13,875
( Engine rattling )

1260
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:26,687
Hey Mickey, where'd
they have you stashed?

1261
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:28,189
Sluggo, get rid of the geezer.

1262
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:31,926
Relax, lollipop, look at me.

1263
01:15:31,928 --> 01:15:35,963
Look into my eyes and everything
is gonna be just fine.

1264
01:15:35,965 --> 01:15:38,032
They're dreamy.
I know.

1265
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:41,969
Now you sit tight, you keep
an eye on Sluggo's playmate.

1266
01:15:41,971 --> 01:15:45,806
I have a message for the people
and I'm in need of a medium.

1267
01:15:45,808 --> 01:15:47,308
Oh.

1268
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:51,045
You'll always be
an extra large to me, Mickey.

1269
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,721
Mick.

1270
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:03,925
Mick, I've been thinking.

1271
01:16:03,927 --> 01:16:06,327
We really ought to get
that suit of Johnny's

1272
01:16:06,329 --> 01:16:07,929
so's I could protect you.

1273
01:16:07,931 --> 01:16:09,564
Look up.
Huh?

1274
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:11,566
Look up.

1275
01:16:11,568 --> 01:16:13,901
I hope I never forget

1276
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:16,270
the way the sky looks tonight.

1277
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:19,574
This is gonna sound crazy.

1278
01:16:19,576 --> 01:16:22,743
Crazier than
a Quaker in a whorehouse.

1279
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:26,080
I look up there, I think
it's home.

1280
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:27,715
Maybe just--

1281
01:16:27,717 --> 01:16:31,185
But Mick, we need that suit.

1282
01:16:31,187 --> 01:16:34,188
How do you think you came back?

1283
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:36,591
From where?

1284
01:16:36,593 --> 01:16:40,261
But they told me that my spirit
animal was an armadillo.

1285
01:16:40,263 --> 01:16:41,896
Fascinating.

1286
01:16:41,898 --> 01:16:43,764
Yeah.

1287
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:45,600
Are you brain damaged or drunk?

1288
01:16:45,602 --> 01:16:47,969
We're on the air.

1289
01:16:47,971 --> 01:16:51,806
Where are we working tomorrow?

1290
01:16:51,808 --> 01:16:53,240
Ooh, this is a nice surprise.

1291
01:16:53,242 --> 01:16:55,142
Oh, no, no, don't tell me,
let me guess.

1292
01:16:55,144 --> 01:16:57,979
The Martians have landed.
Oh, it's better than that.

1293
01:16:57,981 --> 01:16:59,780
Better than Martians?

1294
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:01,816
I have to tell you, folks, there
have been a lot of weird rumors

1295
01:17:01,818 --> 01:17:03,317
circulating about this man.

1296
01:17:03,319 --> 01:17:05,720
Tabloids have been reporting
that he's dropped dead.

1297
01:17:05,722 --> 01:17:07,121
Or disappeared.

1298
01:17:07,123 --> 01:17:08,723
Or even worse.

1299
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:10,291
But evidently,
nothing could keep him away

1300
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:12,360
from Cousin Quilty's
show tonight.

1301
01:17:12,362 --> 01:17:14,962
Put your hands
together, ladies and gentlemen,

1302
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:17,264
for one of the greatest
singers of all time,

1303
01:17:17,266 --> 01:17:20,801
The Man With
the Grin, Mickey O'Flynn!

1304
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:22,370
( Clapping, gong sounds )

1305
01:17:22,372 --> 01:17:26,641
There we go.

1306
01:17:26,643 --> 01:17:28,042
Hi!

1307
01:17:28,044 --> 01:17:30,244
Oh--

1308
01:17:30,246 --> 01:17:32,146
Mickey.

1309
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:33,981
Looking--

1310
01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:35,716
You're looking good.

1311
01:17:35,718 --> 01:17:38,152
I'll give you
a Cousin Quilty welcome.

1312
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:40,087
( Singsong warbling )

1313
01:17:40,089 --> 01:17:42,757
Thanks for having me, Quilt.

1314
01:17:42,759 --> 01:17:45,026
Who's this lovely little
hummingbird?

1315
01:17:45,028 --> 01:17:47,328
( Squealing, growling )

1316
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:49,296
I'm sorry, I should
have introduced you.

1317
01:17:49,298 --> 01:17:52,700
This is the lovely Robin Wray,
star of "Beatnik Buffalo."

1318
01:17:52,702 --> 01:17:54,869
( slurping, awkward laughter )

1319
01:17:54,871 --> 01:17:57,104
"Beatnik Barbecue."
"Beatnik Barbecue."

1320
01:17:57,106 --> 01:17:59,173
Oh, if that's
an invitation to dinner,

1321
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:01,042
you can count me in, darling.

1322
01:18:01,044 --> 01:18:02,443
I don't eat meat.

1323
01:18:02,445 --> 01:18:04,245
Well, except in the movie,
of course.

1324
01:18:04,247 --> 01:18:06,147
There's been a lot of rumors
about what's been happening

1325
01:18:06,149 --> 01:18:08,683
with you lately, Mick.
That's why I'm here, Quilt.

1326
01:18:08,685 --> 01:18:11,886
I want to tell the whole world
that I'm alive.

1327
01:18:11,888 --> 01:18:14,855
I'm alive and
I feel magnificent.

1328
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:17,425
( Clapping and whistling )

1329
01:18:21,396 --> 01:18:23,731
Now that's a coincidence.

1330
01:18:23,733 --> 01:18:25,199
( Clayton ) Mickey?

1331
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:26,901
( Bonni ) And that no-good
Sluggo is with him.

1332
01:18:26,903 --> 01:18:28,335
Traitor!

1333
01:18:28,337 --> 01:18:30,104
It's not, like, a rerun?

1334
01:18:30,106 --> 01:18:32,273
Hey, hey, shut up--
I wanna hear this.

1335
01:18:32,275 --> 01:18:35,209
So-- so you weren't
abducted by aliens?

1336
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:38,379
It was a carefully orchestrated
publicity stunt,

1337
01:18:38,381 --> 01:18:42,717
the brainchild of my
former employer, King Clayton.

1338
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:44,452
That's it--
That does it.

1339
01:18:44,454 --> 01:18:46,921
I'm tearing up his contract!

1340
01:18:46,923 --> 01:18:49,890
Well, I guess the proverbial
cat is out of the bag.

1341
01:18:49,892 --> 01:18:52,393
So get out of town
while you still can.

1342
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:54,328
Oh, wow.

1343
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:56,297
My face?
Are you okay?

1344
01:18:56,299 --> 01:18:59,400
My face is flopping off,
what the hell's going on?

1345
01:18:59,402 --> 01:19:01,736
Am I sick--
Am I sick?

1346
01:19:01,738 --> 01:19:03,337
No, no, no,
it's just--

1347
01:19:03,339 --> 01:19:05,272
Do I look sick? <i>No,
you look fine, Mick.</i>

1348
01:19:05,274 --> 01:19:07,007
<i>Well, heck.</i>

1349
01:19:07,009 --> 01:19:08,476
There's just so many
beautiful things out there.

1350
01:19:08,478 --> 01:19:10,244
In fact, on the way
over tonight,

1351
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:12,079
look what I found.

1352
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:16,917
It was just lying there in the
road, unnoticed and unloved,

1353
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:20,354
yet all the beauty
and mystery of life can be found

1354
01:19:20,356 --> 01:19:24,959
in that serpentine, sensual,
sinewy body.

1355
01:19:24,961 --> 01:19:26,360
Look at it.

1356
01:19:26,362 --> 01:19:28,262
It's exotic--
whoop--

1357
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:29,864
It's deadly.

1358
01:19:29,866 --> 01:19:31,398
It's alive!
( shrieking )

1359
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:36,103
Yes.

1360
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:39,073
It's the booze,
Daddy-o.

1361
01:19:39,075 --> 01:19:41,108
Mickey, who is
this dapper young man

1362
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:42,510
you've brought along with you?

1363
01:19:42,512 --> 01:19:44,211
A friendly friend?

1364
01:19:44,213 --> 01:19:45,813
Ah Quilt, he's more than that.

1365
01:19:45,815 --> 01:19:47,214
Sluggo is my son.

1366
01:19:47,216 --> 01:19:48,883
Fine looking young man.

1367
01:19:48,885 --> 01:19:51,185
I didn't exactly germinate
his mom's hooha

1368
01:19:51,187 --> 01:19:52,787
or anything like that,

1369
01:19:52,789 --> 01:19:55,122
but Sluggo is my son.

1370
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:57,825
That rotten dirtbag.

1371
01:19:57,827 --> 01:20:01,128
And to think, I love them both.

1372
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:02,997
Adopted?

1373
01:20:02,999 --> 01:20:06,333
Yeah, damn straight,
100% bona fide adoptee.

1374
01:20:06,335 --> 01:20:09,970
The son I always wanted.

1375
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:12,006
Don't touch that dial.

1376
01:20:12,008 --> 01:20:15,075
<i>We're coming</i> <i>right back!</i>

1377
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:20,881
<i>I'd like say a word</i>
<i>about Chesterfields.</i>

1378
01:20:20,883 --> 01:20:22,316
Where's that studio?

1379
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:23,951
We have to save Bliss.

1380
01:20:23,953 --> 01:20:25,452
What's Bliss got to
do with this?

1381
01:20:25,454 --> 01:20:27,054
I said, what's
Bliss got--

1382
01:20:27,056 --> 01:20:29,190
Johnny, Johnny...
They got Bliss.

1383
01:20:29,192 --> 01:20:30,591
Sluggo abducted her.

1384
01:20:30,593 --> 01:20:32,493
Double whammy!
What?

1385
01:20:32,495 --> 01:20:34,495
Well, what are we doing waiting
around her-- Let's scramble!

1386
01:20:34,497 --> 01:20:36,363
Unlikely they'd
still be there, chief.

1387
01:20:36,365 --> 01:20:40,067
The Quilty show is on
a one-hour delay.

1388
01:20:40,069 --> 01:20:44,038
Hello, The Cave, the utmost in
underground entertainment,

1389
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,873
how can I--

1390
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:47,541
Oh.

1391
01:20:47,543 --> 01:20:49,143
Sorry.

1392
01:20:49,145 --> 01:20:50,544
Yeah, sweetie, he's right here.

1393
01:20:50,546 --> 01:20:53,914
Johnny, it's for you.

1394
01:20:53,916 --> 01:20:55,883
It's Mickey's son.

1395
01:20:55,885 --> 01:20:57,284
Speak, dead man.

1396
01:20:57,286 --> 01:20:59,019
Bring the suit, punk.

1397
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:01,255
That is, if you want to see
your little Miss Muffet

1398
01:21:01,257 --> 01:21:02,957
all in one piece.

1399
01:21:02,959 --> 01:21:04,525
What makes you think I care?

1400
01:21:04,527 --> 01:21:06,493
A juggler has balls,
doesn't he?

1401
01:21:06,495 --> 01:21:08,462
Don't make
me laugh, pretty boy.

1402
01:21:08,464 --> 01:21:10,297
She's got yours and tight.

1403
01:21:10,299 --> 01:21:13,467
Mickey, I don't think
I like your son--

1404
01:21:13,469 --> 01:21:15,369
He scares me.

1405
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:18,606
Now, now, he just wants
to do what's right for us.

1406
01:21:18,608 --> 01:21:21,508
He's got a big heart beneath
all that blubber.

1407
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:24,912
The suit--
Damnation's Hole, two hours!

1408
01:21:24,914 --> 01:21:27,548
All right, you really crossed
the line this time, Sluggo.

1409
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:29,183
All right, I'll be there.

1410
01:21:29,185 --> 01:21:32,953
But I'm warning you,
it's gonna get ugly.

1411
01:21:32,955 --> 01:21:36,290
Good, you'll know what it
feels like to be me.

1412
01:21:36,292 --> 01:21:38,926
He has mean nostrils,
have you noticed?

1413
01:21:38,928 --> 01:21:41,996
He's a good egg, he's
just a little hard-boiled.

1414
01:21:41,998 --> 01:21:43,397
Two hours!

1415
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,301
Not like you Mickey.

1416
01:21:47,303 --> 01:21:49,103
You're boiled to perfection.

1417
01:21:49,105 --> 01:21:50,504
Sunny side up.

1418
01:21:50,506 --> 01:21:52,139
