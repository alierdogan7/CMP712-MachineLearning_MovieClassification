00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:58,244
Hey, what did the blue jay say

3
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:01,787
To the little sparrow
on the fence one day

4
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:05,517
Say, you'll never guess, so I

5
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:09,153
Will tell you what I overheard
while passing by

6
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,097
The blue jay said " How do you do

7
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,897
Mr. Sparrow, how are you"

8
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,906
The sparrow said " How do I do

9
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,933
I do just as I please"
and then away he flew

To the little sparrow
as he flew away

12
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:39,316
Say, nobody ever heard

13
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:42,884
Because he didn't get a chance
to say a word

14
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:45,897
The blue jay didn't notice

15
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:50,231
That on the fence
there was a cat

16
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:54,399
The sparrow flew
but the blue jay sat

17
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:57,910
And now he's just a little
bird on Nellie's hat

- It's the professor.

- You take that back!

- Take it back!
- All right.

36

You don't think the professor would
take anything that didn't belong to him?

That's just the trouble
with the professor!

38
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,256
He don't seem to know what
belongs to him and what doesn't.

39
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:02,290
The professor's one
of the "honestest" men in the world.

40

And, besides, he's reformed.

after all I've done for you boys?

48
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,052
- I'm ashamed of you.
- You see?

49
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:31,893
Yes. As a matter of fact,
I just learned of a big party uptown...

50
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:36,025
where, if we hurry, we can pick up
a penny or two playing for the guests.

Tsk! The hats!
Can't you see you're in a swell house?

60
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:17,274

these filthy little street Arabs here.

71
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,446

Well, there is one thing.

How big a piece do you want?
A big piece or a real big piece?

to be back in the morning?

213
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:06,949
Oh, I should say 7:45, Cicero,

00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:11,826
That's all right.
I hope you find your cap.

00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:04,684
That's a charming dance,
but we couldn't possibly...

504
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:07,263
- We can do jokes too.
- Yes.

505
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,596
Professor, I sent for you
because I wanted Dimples...

506
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,829
for a part in the new play
I'm going to produce.

507
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:16,340
I hate to disappoint you,
but I wanted her, not you.

508
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:21,734
Oh, well, that's flne. Fine.

509
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:27,275
Couldn't you flx it so the professor
could do it instead of me?

510
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,751
I'm sorry,
but the part is for a little girl.

511
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,118
Then you'd better get
some other little girl.

512
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,522
I wouldn't be any good
without the professor.

- Yes.
- The theater business is new to me.

515
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:42,533
I could use a helper,
sort of an assistant.

516
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:45,295
Sir, I've never been
an assistant in my life.

517
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:49,100
- Oh, I'm sorry and...
- I'll make an exception in this case.

518
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,107
- Splendid!
- Yes.

523
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,682
Quite.

524
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:10,293
You're going to do
a beautiful play, Dimples...

525
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:13,455
a play that's never
been produced before.

526
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,429
It's about a little girl named Eva...

to pay for the tickets.

556
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:55,493
I had them printed for $37.50.

557
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:59,400
That leaves you a clear profit
of $2 and a half,

558
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,768
and here it is to the penny.

559
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:06,003
- Yes, sir, to the penny.
- Fine. You've done an excellent job.

560
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:11,242
Yes. And now I'll need
$95 for advertising.

561
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:13,249
As long as you're paying the bills,

562
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:15,251
I think it would save time
if you handled all the money.

00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:18,083
Uh... oh.

564
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:20,885
Here it is. About $800.

565
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:24,621
It's all I have left and just enough
to finance the rest of the production.

566
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:27,596
Uh, uh, all right.

00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:30,634

00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:32,703

My good man, what would you say
a watch like this is worth?

Uh, oh, that's a superb antique.

I haven't the money here,
but if you'll come to my bank with me,

I'll give you $800 for it.

I'm sorry, gentlemen.
Yea, it grieves me,

but my boat is departing

- I don't like him.
- I detest him.

- Why, it's Napoleon's watch.

Well, we supplied you everything

We're the creditors, one might say,

- The money Mr. Drew owes for scenery.

- And the costumes and the...
- Oh, yes, that money.

You're surely not suggesting that
Mr. Drew and I intend to defraud you.

Well, I, uh...
I don't like their attitude, Allen.

I never heard of people
doing business this way.

- Uhh...

00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:27,925
Yes, well, the truth is,
I flnd myself a little short.

645
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,902
Well, it's around $800.

646
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:37,668
That's all the money I gave you.

647
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:42,440
- It wasn't my fault. I was cheated.
- That's all the money I had!

Now, what about it?

650
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,814
I'm sorry, but you heard what he said.

651
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:55,825

Nobody's going to put anything over
on Emery T. Hawkins.

00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:58,487
And you're not through
with me either.

653
00:44:58,562 --> 00:45:00,826
That's what I get for giving credit
to a bluffing upstart.

00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:29,189
But the man swore to me.
He gave me his word.

661
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:31,750
You told me you
wouldn't steal anymore.

662
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:34,855
But what I really meant...
I mean, l-l-l...

663
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:37,867
I didn't buy the watch
for myself. L-l...

664
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:40,631
You said you were
going to be honest.

665
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:46,640
Uhh. Well, I guess I'm not much good.

666
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:49,008
Maybe you'd be better off without me.

667
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,513
- But I thought you had money, Allen.
- I did have...

668
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:53,549
enough, anyway.

669
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:55,778
I guess I didn't
take care of it very well.

670
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:58,855
Well, uh, what are you
going to do now?

671
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,356
I suppose I can get a job somewhere...

672
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,394
and maybe save up
enough money to do the show.

673
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:06,929
That needn't change
our plans about marriage any, Cleo.

674
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:12,532
I don't suppose money is very important
to people who are really in love.

675
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,594
You can say that
because you've always had money.

676
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:18,573
- Perhaps.
- I'm afraid this changes everything.

677
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:21,805
Then you're not really
in love with me.

678
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:24,575
Oh, you mustn't say that, darling.

679
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:27,149
I'll run along. Good-bye, Allen.

680
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:30,675
<i>[Allen]</i>
<i>Good-bye.</i>

681
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:34,653
I'm awfully sorry, Allen.

682
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:37,489
Look here, Drew.
It's all right for the rest.

683
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:39,495
They can take their things back
and sell them.

684
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:42,123
These costumes have been made
to fit your play.

685
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,133
They're not worth a penny
to anybody else.

686
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,669
How am I going to get
my money out of them?

687
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:50,605
- Sorry, but there's nothing I can do.
- We'll see about that!

688
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:53,575
Somebody's going to jail for this!

689
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,153
Mrs. Drew,

690
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:07,952
do you still think I'm worth $5,000?

691
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:10,516
You're worth ever so much more, darling.

692
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,820
And do you still want me
to come and live with you?

693
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:17,366
I can't think of
anything I'd like more.

694
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:20,130
All right, I'll come.

695
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:22,468
Have you got the $5,000 with you?

696
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,473
[Laughing]

697
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:35,413
I'll be right out!
It won't take me more than a minute.

698
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:45,056
So you're really going.

699
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:47,358
Yes, Professor.

700
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:51,162
Well, I knew it was
the best thing for you,

701
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:55,604
but l-I didn't think
you'd want to go.

702
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:58,573
Well, it's like Mrs. Drew said,

703
00:47:58,642 --> 00:48:02,601
"A little girl shouldn't be raised
in this kind of'envinoment."'

704
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:05,773
Yes, you'II... be much better off...

705
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:09,410
in that nice, big house.

706
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:14,149
Of course, it'll be Ionely.
There'll be no children to play with.

707
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:19,491
But I gotta think of the future,
Professor. That's what Mrs. Drew says.

708
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,396
Yes, and she's right.

709
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:27,460
And she'll see that you get
the right kind of food too.

710
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:32,440
Plenty of carrots...
maybe three or four times a day.

711
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:39,407
Of course, you won't be able
to go fishing with me anymore.

712
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:44,183
<i>But I guess it</i>'<i>s the best thing.</i>

713
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:48,748
<i>Fishing isn</i>'<i>t any too good</i>
<i>for little girls.</i>

714
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:50,759
I like fishing fine.

715
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:56,492
But I guess it isn't good
for little girls.

716
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:02,335
No, l... I guess it isn't.

717
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:05,602
- <i>[Knocking]</i>
- Come in.

718
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:10,045
- Well, I think I'll be going.
- A note from Miss Drew, sir.

719
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,775
- Are you ready, miss?
- I'm ready.

720
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:21,582
- Ahh...
- Good-bye, Professor.

721
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:23,592
Good-bye, my little angel.

722
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:29,031
You'll come and see me sometimes,
won't you?

723
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:31,624
Of course I will.

724
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:36,799
And you're gonna take good care
of yourself like you said you would?

725
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:39,068
I will.

726
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:43,408
And you'II... be good too?

727
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,414
Uh, yeah.

728
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:18,179
<i>[Knocking]</i>

729
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:27,116
Mr. Professor, there's a man without
a policeman, Mr. Hawkins, to see you.

730
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:29,749
- I'm not here. Tell him I'm not here.
- Yes, sir.

731
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,057
- Mr. Hawkins, he's gone...
- Not here, eh?

732
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:36,258
Listen, Appleby, I've come here
to give you one more chance...

733
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:38,267
to pay for those costumes.

734
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:41,065
If you don't,
I'll have you in jail in an hour.

735
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:45,239
L...

736
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:47,572
You'll have your money tonight.

737
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:51,637
I might've known you'd try that.
I should've sent the law.

738
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:54,411
I made a mistake coming here myself.

739
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:58,215
You certainly did,
Mr. Hawkins, and if you don't get out,

740
00:50:58,321 --> 00:51:03,281
I'll be tempted to pull off one of your
arms and beat your head in with it!

741
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:07,289
Professor, I didn't know
he was gonna start nothin'!

742
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:52,470
The professor used to dance
and sing for me after dinner.

743
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:55,136
But, of course,
the dinners weren't good for me.

744
00:51:57,514 --> 00:52:00,608
Last night we had wieners...
four a piece!

745
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:07,047
Can you do birdcalls?

746
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:19,201
[Clinking]

747
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:53,095
[Clears Throat]

748
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,298
Professor Appleby to see you, Mrs. Drew.

749
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:59,900
- Oh, yes. Come right in, Professor.
- <i>Oh, ho.</i>

750
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:03,878
- I see you got my note.
- Yes, thank you.

751
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:08,941
I, uh... I guess it's better
for everyone concerned.

752
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:13,682
Dimples will be happy,
and my debts will be paid.

753
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:15,849
And as for me, l...

754
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:19,656
I guess I ought to be glad to know
that Dimples has such a fine home.

755
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:22,197
You won't be sorry for this, Professor.

756
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:27,396
I wonder if I might see Dimples
for a minute, just to say good-bye.

757
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:32,134
Oh, yes, of course. Rufus,
take Professor Appleby to Dimples' room.

758
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,302
- Yes, ma'am.
- Ah, thank you.

759
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:53,295
Why, my darling.

760
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,665
Oh, Professor!

761
00:53:56,733 --> 00:54:01,864
Oh! Why, what's wrong with
my little girl? Aren't you happy here?

762
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:06,068
Oh, yes, yes, I'm very happy.

763
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:08,235
I hurt my finger.

764
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:10,279
Where? Are you sure?

765
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:13,282
Of course.

766
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:19,113
There. That's better, isn't it?
[Chuckles]

767
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:21,281
There we are.

768
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:24,360
And you can see
this lovely dress Mrs. Drew got me.

769
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:29,729
Yes, it's beautiful.
Must've cost a lot of money, huh?

770
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:33,599
And she's gonna buy me
some dolls too... three of them.

771
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:36,730
Ah, you're a very lucky little girl,

772
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:40,401
and I'm happy to know that
you've got such a nice home.

773
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:45,813
It isn't every little girl who can have
such a good "envinoment." [Crying]

774
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:49,113
Oh, my darling.
I'm gonna take you home.

775
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:55,723
No, Professor. Mrs. Drew says I'm gonna
have a lot of advantages here.

776
00:54:55,792 --> 00:55:00,593
Yes, but no place is nice for
my little girl when it makes her cry.

777
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:02,598
You're going home with me.

778
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:05,157
But if I stay here,
you won't have to go to jail.

779
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:07,465
You can give Allen back his money.

780
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:11,303
[Chuckles]
I won't go to jail, sweet.

781
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,916
Mrs. Drew, l... I'm terribly sorry.

782
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:25,454
It was in a moment of great weakness
that I took this money.

783
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:27,922
- Oh...
- When I saw my little girl crying,

784
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:32,485
I realized there wasn't enough money
in the world to compensate me for that.

785
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:36,225
You saw her crying? I don't understand.
Don't you like it here?

786
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:39,826
I do, but I get so Ionesome
without the professor.

787
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:44,431
[Chuckles] I was willing to give her
up, knowing all you could do for her,

788
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,873
but I see now that...

789
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,707
Dimples needs me
as much as I need her.

790
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:52,577
Oh! I guess I was
foolish to imagine...

791
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:55,709
the child could ever become
as fond of me as she is of you.

792
00:55:55,819 --> 00:56:00,188
I admire your honesty and respect you
for declining the money.

793
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:03,953
- Oh, thank you, Mrs. Drew.
- And I thank you too.

794
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:08,157
You know, I wouldn't go away
if the professor could live here too.

795
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:13,802
Mrs. Drew,
why don't you marry the professor?

796
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,168
[Laughing]
Why, my dear child...

797
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:20,608
Then your house wouldn't be so Ionesome.
Professor's lots of fun.

798
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:24,943
- [Coughing]
- I'd marry him if I was grown up.

799
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:28,541
Course, he hasn't much money,
but you've got a lot. [Giggles]

800
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:32,081
Yes, well, I, uh,

801
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:35,624
think perhaps you'd better
run along, darling, and get your things.

802
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:40,253
- I'll be with you in a minute.
- Good-bye, Mrs. Drew.

803
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:43,060
Maybe you can come
and see us some day.

804
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:46,835
At our house,
you won't have to eat any carrots!

805
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:49,064
Oh!

806
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:51,937
Heh, heh!
Well, good-bye, Mrs. Drew,

807
00:56:52,008 --> 00:56:54,704
and thank you for all your kindness.

808
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:04,479
Of course, you realize, Mrs. Drew,

809
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:08,353
I was only doing this
to save our poor little home.

810
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:11,155
Why, yes, of course.

811
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:14,822
But thanks to a kindly providence,
I still have means of getting the money.

812
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:18,925
Of course, it will mean that I'll have
to sell my one remaining heirloom,

813
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:23,405
something that's been in the family
for generations, but I'll do it.

814
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:25,407
Oh, that's too bad.

815
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:28,911
I wouldn't mind so much if I didn't have
to sell it at such a great sacrifice.

816
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:31,947
But it seems a pity that these
money-grubbing jewelers...

817
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:33,949
should get the watch for $1,000...

818
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:36,383
when it's easily worth
five times that much.

819
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:39,978
- The watch?
- Yes, yes. Napoleon's watch.

820
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:42,353
- Oh!
- Eh, Josephine gave it to him,

821
00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:45,690
and he gave it to
my grandfather at Elba.

822
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:48,322
Hmm, poor, dear Grandfather.

823
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:51,492
If he'd ever guessed that I'd
have to sell Napoleon's watch...

824
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:53,502
to a money-grubbing jeweler...

825
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:57,028
- Is that it?
- Yes. Isn't it a beautiful thing?

826
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:59,904
- Is there anything I could do?
- Oh, no, no, Mrs. Drew.

827
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,604
I couldn't take money from you.

828
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:06,308
But, uh, perhaps...
perhaps you'd let me give it to you.

829
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:08,646
- Why...
- I'd like you to have it.

830
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:10,820
You're very kind,
but I couldn't take it.

831
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:15,982
Of course, you could give me the small
pittance that the jewelers offered,

832
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:20,586
and someday when fortune smiles on me
again I'll buy it back from you.

833
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:23,131
For Dame Fortune is a fickle gypsy,

834
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:26,327
always blind and often tipsy.
[Chuckles]

835
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:29,929
- A thousand dollars?
- Yes, dear lady.

836
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:32,497
- Oh.
- You'll take care of it, won't you?

837
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:37,911
- Yes.
- Now I know just how Napoleon felt...

838
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:42,350
when he had to give up
this beautiful trinket.

839
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:45,717
Oh, thank you.
Good night, Mrs. Drew.

840
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:48,586
Good night.

841
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:51,421
- What a lovely hand.
- Why, Professor.

842
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:55,294
- Oh ho! Pardon me. I forgot myself.
- Oh!

843
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:58,266
- I didn't realize my position.
- [Laughs]

844
00:58:58,334 --> 00:59:01,701
But after all, Mrs. Drew,
I'm only human,

845
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:04,035
and your charms are irresistible.

846
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:06,041
[Both Laugh]

847
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:08,577
Good night. Good night.

848
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,421
[Crowd Chatter]

849
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:27,860
Uh, 35 cents for one ticket?

850
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:30,695
Well, opening night prices
are a little high,

851
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:32,701
but those are
the best seats in the house.

852
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:40,035
[Clears Throat]
Well, Allen's play opens tonight.

853
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:42,907
I'm afraid Betty
is still fond of Allen.

854
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:45,709
- I've forbidden her to see him.
- Have you?

855
00:59:45,782 --> 00:59:48,080
Yes, the theater's ruined
that young man.

856
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:52,520
- Can't we speak of something else?
- Hmm? Yes, of course.

857
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,523
[Chuckles]

858
00:59:54,624 --> 00:59:58,526
Oh, by the way,
I thought you might be interested...

859
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:02,531
in an old emerald ring
that I picked up at auction.

860
01:00:02,632 --> 01:00:07,069
Five hundred years old. One of
the finest things in my collection.

861
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:11,903
Mmm. I know so little
about these things.

862
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:13,909
By the way...

863
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:17,310
I have something I think
might interest you...

864
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:20,178
the watch Josephine gave Napoleon.

865
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:25,016
- Oh!
- Professor Appleby had it
in his family for many years.

866
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:27,022
Oh.

867
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:31,526
Mm-hmm.

868
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:36,264
Mm.

869
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:38,926
Well,
if that watch belonged to Napoleon,

870
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:40,867
it was given to him
20 years after he died.

871
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:45,931
- What?
- This thing is tin. An obvious fake.

872
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:49,740
But I gave the professor
a thousand dollars for it.

873
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,337
Then you were robbed.
The watch is worthless.

874
01:00:55,518 --> 01:00:58,112
And after I helped him.

875
01:00:58,187 --> 01:01:02,283
I kept him out of jail. I trusted him.

876
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:06,351
I believed all the kind things he said.

877
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:09,329
- <i>The man has made a fool of you.</i>
- He hasn't yet!

878
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:13,335
I'm going to show him that
I can be just as merciless as he can!

879
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:17,703
Get your hat, Jasper.
We're going to the police station!

880
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:22,802
- Can you see her?
- Who, darlin'?

881
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:25,973
Oh, don't pretend.
I know you're looking for Betty.

882
01:01:26,049 --> 01:01:29,314
I don't see her.
I don't suppose she'll be here.

883
01:01:37,326 --> 01:01:40,090
I'm just a doorman, miss,
and orders is orders.

884
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:42,529
That's all right, Spike.
We're expecting her.

885
01:01:42,598 --> 01:01:46,500
- You're expecting me?
- As if you didn't know! [Giggles]

886
01:01:56,746 --> 01:02:01,479
- Did you flnd her yet?
- No. I didn't think she'd come.

887
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:05,587
Betty.

888
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:09,182
I think I'd better go
and rehearse my lines.

889
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:12,989
- This is the nicest surprise I've had.
- I came to wish you good luck.

890
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:15,155
This is good luck, Betty.

891
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:18,131
I didn't think you'd ever look at me
again after the fool I made of myself.

892
01:02:18,201 --> 01:02:22,001
I'm willing to forget all that, Allen.
But Father never will.

893
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:24,164
If he knew I'd come here,
he'd be in a rage.

894
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,174
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Ten minutes!</i>

895
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:29,177

Oh, Topsy, Topsy.
You've been very bad again.

901
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:16,049
- We want to see Professor Appleby.
- You'll have to wait here.

902
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:18,821
I'll see if I can find him.

903
01:03:22,265 --> 01:03:25,564
Don't you think all of this can wait
until tomorrow, Caroline?

904
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:29,628
- You know how I loathe this place.
- No! He must be arrested.

905
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:32,139
It wasn't bad enough
that he robbed me of the money.

906
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:36,304
He also had the insolence to put the
money into this foul venture of Allen's.

907
01:03:36,379 --> 01:03:38,279
<i>Mr. Appleby! Mr. Appleby!</i>

908
01:03:38,347 --> 01:03:41,908
- Yes?
- Do you happen to know two policemen?

909
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:44,043
- Two policemen?
- Yeah, policemen.

910
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,281
- What...
- They're lookin' for you.

I do like you, Topsy.

915
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:28,664
I like you because you've never
had any father or mother.

916
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:31,962
I like you, and I want you to be good.

917
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:35,595
- I want you to be good for my sake.
- [Laughing]

Lord, missy!

919
01:04:41,777 --> 01:04:46,009
I'd be ashamed to be good!
[Laughing Continues]

920
01:04:46,082 --> 01:04:50,746
Oh, Topsy, Topsy. I'm sorry for you.

921
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:53,914
Have you kids seen a suspicious-Iooking
character around here?

922
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:58,393
- [All Laugh]
- I beg your pardon!

923
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:04,565
[Whispers]
Dimples!

924
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:29,953
Hey, you! What are you duckin'
in and out of the place for?

925
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:31,993
Are you tryin' to hide?

926
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:33,995
- Who, me?
- Yes, you!

927
01:05:34,063 --> 01:05:36,497
Why, I was sitting there
tending to my own business.

928
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:39,659
If you don't mind, I'll go back
to attending to my business.

- <i>[Policeman] Hey!</i>

- I thought you said you were Uncle Tom.
- Yes, you're quite right.

01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:57,885
- I am Uncle Tom.
- You're supposed to be on the stage.

Uhh, on the st...

for calling my attention to it.

L... I just want to talk for a few
minutes with these gentlemen.

01:07:29,111 --> 01:07:32,239
Never mind that. He's under arrest
for stealing a thousand dollars.

- He stole...
- But I didn't take it for myself.

- This is my affair, Allen.
- It's painful, but it has to be done.

No, darling.
You've gotta stay and finish the play.

- Now, listen.

Young man, are you suggesting
that we witness this foul exhibition?

983
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:20,083
- We will not sit down!
- The show is on. Sit and stop talking.

984
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,920
- I will not!
- We are not degenerates!

985
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:26,052
Officer, can't you make these people
understand? They'll disrupt the show.

986
01:09:26,128 --> 01:09:29,962
Very well, Jasper. Let's not make
a scene. It'll only last a minute.

987
01:09:30,032 --> 01:09:33,399
<i>Comin</i>'<i>for to carry me home, oh</i>

988
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:40,408
<i>Swing low, sweet chariot</i>

989
01:09:40,476 --> 01:09:45,038
- Betty's here! Shh!
- <i>Comin</i>'<i>for to carry me home</i>

990
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:47,048
[Humming]

991
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:50,483
Well, you're looking much better, dear.

992
01:09:52,154 --> 01:09:54,987
In a day or two, you're going to be
as strong as a lion.

993
01:09:55,057 --> 01:10:00,757
No, Papa.
You needn't pretend, because I know.

994
01:10:00,829 --> 01:10:02,763
You know what, dear?

995
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:06,358
That I'm going away, and very soon.

996
01:10:06,468 --> 01:10:08,936
Oh, my baby,
you mustn't think those things.

997
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:14,032
I wouldn't be surprised if you were out
of bed by tomorrow, playing with Topsy.

998
01:10:14,143 --> 01:10:16,077
No, Father.

999
01:10:16,145 --> 01:10:18,113
The angels told me.

1000
01:10:19,181 --> 01:10:22,446
They told me last night...

1001
01:10:22,518 --> 01:10:25,954
when my head hurt so.

1002
01:10:27,022 --> 01:10:29,547
They're going to take me to Heaven.

1003
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:33,356
Now, you'll feel more cheerful
when you've had a nap.

1004
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:35,727
I am cheerful, Papa,

1005
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:39,962
because Heaven is beautiful.

1006
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:44,233
But... But I'll miss you.

1007
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:48,868
You're not going to leave me,
my pet... not for a long, long time.

1008
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:53,446
And there's something else
that makes me sad.

1009
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:57,542
Can't something be done
for Uncle Tom and his people?

1010
01:10:58,621 --> 01:11:01,146
What do you mean, dear?

1011
01:11:01,223 --> 01:11:05,887
They love their children
as much as you love me.

1012
01:11:06,962 --> 01:11:10,090
Uncle Tom loves his children.

1013
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:13,999
- Please do something for them.
- Anything I can, dear.

1014
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,037
<i>Eva?</i>

1015
01:11:19,241 --> 01:11:23,177
You'll give Uncle Tom his freedom,
won't you, Papa?

1016
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:26,180
I will, dear. I will.

1017
01:11:30,686 --> 01:11:33,587
<i>Eva? Eva?</i>

1018
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:40,052
I can see those great gates.

1019
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:42,063
They're made of pearls!

1020
01:11:44,233 --> 01:11:47,430
And they're opening wide.

1021
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:51,706
And there are angels.

1022
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:56,000
They're calling for me.

1023
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:59,274
I'm coming.

1024
01:12:01,116 --> 01:12:04,085
I'm... coming.

1025
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:12,321
<i>Eva! Eva!</i>

1026
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:16,654
She doesn't hear.
[Sobbing]

1027
01:12:16,732 --> 01:12:21,260
It's over. Praise the Lord, massah.

1028
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:23,304
It's over.

1029
01:12:24,306 --> 01:12:27,833
Oh, swing low

1030
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:31,845

1036
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:03,376
Well, I guess we better go now.

1037
01:13:04,413 --> 01:13:06,404
Yes, I guess so.

1038
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:08,575
Obviously you haven't a heart.

1039
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:12,484
Who'd think of taking that lovely child
away from her grandfather...

1040
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:15,819
after he helped Allen produce
this beautiful play?

1041
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:18,519
Well, I thought you said
the theater was a bad influence.

1042
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:21,825
I'll thank you not to interfere
with my affairs! Let him go.

1043
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:24,525
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Drew.

1044
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:28,730
You're a woman of great character
and discrimination.

1045

- May I?

- Wait! Don't go!

1047
01:13:45,354 --> 01:13:47,447
We have a treat for you tonight.

1048
01:13:47,523 --> 01:13:51,026
The entire company,
headed by our charming little star,

1049
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:55,790
<i>has prepared a celebration for the first</i>
<i>anniversary of</i> Uncle Tom's Cabin.

1050
01:13:55,864 --> 01:14:00,198
Out of the South has recently come
a new form of entertainment.

1051
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:03,898
Our company wishes to be
the first to present it in New York,

1052
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:06,975
- if it is your pleasure.

Well, the reason a fireman wears
red suspenders?

1086
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:56,377
To keep his pants up. I don't know.
