16
00:02:03,228 --> 00:02:07,130
<i>All he does is work all day</i>

17
00:02:07,165 --> 00:02:10,293

38
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,169
Grr!

39
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:07,783
Curses!

40
00:04:11,556 --> 00:04:14,616
Well, they're too smart for me.

41
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:16,786
Guess I'll go home.

Only bricks and stones
