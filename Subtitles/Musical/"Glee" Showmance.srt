1
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,174
<i>- Mr. Schuester!
- Yeah?</i>

2
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,235
I went to the library
and I got some sheet music...

3
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:16,077
and I wanted to run some songs by you
that feature me heavily on lead vocal.

4
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,140
Thanks, Rach, but I already
got one picked out.

5
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:22,621
- Let me help you with that.
- Thanks, Finn. You're so chivalrous.

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,180
- Thanks. That's a good thing, right?
- Morning, guys.

7
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:27,522
- Hey, Mr. Schue. We're just learning some runs.
- Oh, yeah?

8
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:30,119
So it goes... ¶¶¶¶

9
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,187
- With the finger, huh?
- Pretty fly for a white guy.

10
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:35,462
Oh, thank you, thank you. Hey, don't be
late for rehearsal this afternoon.

11
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,127
- Okay.
- All right.

12
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:40,661
- Morning, Kurt.
- Buenos nachos, Mr. Schue.

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,709
<i>Hey! Let's go Titans.</i>

14
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,711
Yeah. Come on.

15
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,713
Wait.

16
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,740
One day you will all work for me.

17
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,615
<i>Diana, thank you so much for that apple.</i>

18
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:02,354
It was very, very nice of you.
All right?

19
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,093
- Oh!
- Oh, Will! Oh, gosh.

20
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,724
- Hey, Emma.
- Hi.

21
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:12,101
Hey. I wanted to thank you so much
for the advice you gave me the other day.

22
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:15,471
I mean, teaching here and coaching
Glee Club... It's where I belong.

23
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:18,636
Oh, it's no problem. I mean, it's what I do.
I give counsel and give guidance.

24
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:20,770
- I'm a guidance counselor.
- Yeah, you are.

25
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:22,872
- Oh, look. We match. Periwinkle.
- Yeah.

26
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:24,143
Get a room.

27
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,549
Miss Sylvester wants to see you
in her office, Mr. Schue.

28
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:29,747
- She doesn't like to be kept waiting.
- You got it.

29
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,664
- Hey, Sue. You want to see me?
- Hey, buddy. Come on in.

30
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,859
I just blasted my hammies.

31
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,562
Oh.

32
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:45,570
- Iron tablet?
- Uh...

33
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:48,038
Keeps your strength up
while you're menstruating.

34
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,669
- I don't menstruate.
- Yeah? Neither do I.

35
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:54,679
So, I had a little chat
with Principal Figgins...

36
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:57,580
and he said that if your group
doesn't place at regionals...

37
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,481
he's cutting the program.

38
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,712
Ouch.

39
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,153
You don't have to worry about Glee Club.
We're gonna be fine.

40
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:07,922
<i>Really? 'Cause I was at the local library,
where I read Cheerleading Today aloud...</i>

41
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:11,930
to blind geriatrics,
and I came across this little page-turner.

42
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,899
<i>Show Choir Rule Book.</i>

43
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:18,699
And turns out, you need 12 kids
to qualify for regionals.

44
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:22,070
<i>Last time I looked, you only had
five and a half.</i>

45
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,235
Here. Cripple in the wheelchair.

46
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,041
I also took the liberty of highlighting
some special ed classes for you.

47
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:30,207
Maybe you could find some recruits.

48
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:33,741
'Cause I'm not sure there's anybody else
who's gonna wanna swim over...

49
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,119
to your island of misfit toys.

50
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,921
- Are you threatening me, Sue?
- Threatening you?

51
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:45,658
Oh, no, no, no. Presenting you with
an opportunity to compromise yourself?

52
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,600
You betcha.

53
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,627
Let's break it down.

54
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:54,366
You want to be creative.
You want to be in the spotlight.

55
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,874
Face it. You want to be me.

56
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,740
So here's the deal.

57
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:01,803
You do with your depressing
little group of kids...

58
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,816
what I did with my wealthy,
elderly mother.

59
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,819
Euthanize it. It's time.

60
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:11,379
And then I'll be happy to offer you a job
as my second assistant on Cheerios.

61
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:15,257
You can fetch me Gatorade
and launder my soiled delicates.

62
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,558
It'll be very rewarding work for you.

63
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,794
You know what, Sue?
I politely decline your offer.

64
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,099
Glee Club is here to stay.
I believe in my kids.

65
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:28,106
I know you're used to being
the cock of the walk around here.

66
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,505
Offensive.

67
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:32,101
But it looks like your Cheerios are gonna
have some competition.

68
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:36,512
We're gonna show at regionals.
You have my word on that.

69
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,178
Have a good day.

70
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,788
<i>We are in line to be
the most popular kids in the school...</i>

71
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,521
<i>- over the next couple years.
- Yeah. I know.</i>

72
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,393
Prom king and queen.
Homecoming court royalty.

73
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:54,695
I am not giving up those shiny crowns
just so you can express yourself.

74
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:57,463
Look, you're making too big
a deal out of this.

75
00:03:57,537 --> 00:04:00,438
Okay. Let's compromise.

76
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:04,203
If you quit the club,
I'll let you touch my breast.

77
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,711
- Under the shirt?
- Over the bra.

78
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:12,112
No, no. I can't.

79
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,710
I want to do Glee.
I'm really happy when I'm performing.

80
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:18,223
<i>People think you're gay now, Finn.
And you know what that makes me?</i>

81
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:22,352
- Your big gay beard.
- Look. I-I gotta go to class. Okay?

82
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,522
Just relax. Everything's gonna work out.

83
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,594
Eavesdrop much?

84
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,661
Time for some girl talk, man hands.

85
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,676
You can dance with him. You can sing
with him. But you will never have him.

86
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:41,009
I understand why you'd be threatened.
Finn and I have made a connection.

87
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,538
But I'm an honorable person.
I don't need to steal your man.

88
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,949
I have plenty of suitors of my own.

89
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,353
Every day Glee's status is going up,
and yours is going down. Deal with it.

90
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,353
- Awesome.
- Holla!

91
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,392
¶¶ Ah, freak out ¶¶

92
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,930
¶¶ Le freak, c'est chic ¶¶

93
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,398
- ¶¶ Freak out ¶¶
- Energy, guys! It's disco.

94
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,334
¶¶ Le freak, c'est chic
Ah, freak out ¶¶

95
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:07,498
- Good with the hands.
John Travolta hands. All right.
- ¶¶ Le freak, c'est chic ¶¶

96
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,507
- We're freaking out. Let's go.
- ¶¶ Freak out ¶¶

97
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,406
¶¶ Le freak, c'est chic ¶¶

98
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,945
- And up and out and down. Good.
- ¶¶ Have you heard ¶¶

99
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,208
<i>- Good. Good. Good, guys.
- ¶¶ About the new dance craze ¶¶</i>

100
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:20,548
¶¶ Listen to us
I'm sure you'll be amazed ¶¶

101
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,418
<i>- ¶¶ Big fun ¶¶
- Whoa, whoa! Hell to the nah!</i>

102
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:28,051
<i>First of all, you try to bust my face again,
and I will cut you!</i>

103
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:30,118
And, also, this song is terrible.

104
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:33,029
No, no, no. It's not the song.
You guys just need to get into it.

105
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:36,364
- No, it's the song. It's really gay.
- We need modern music, Mr. Schue.

106
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:40,065
<i>I'm sorry, guys.
We don't have time to discuss this.</i>

107
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,404
- We're doing this song this Friday
at the pep assembly.
- In front of the whole school?

108
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:44,909
Exactly.

109
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,639
They're gonna throw fruit at us.
And I just had a facial.

110
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,182
- I'll press charges if that happens.
- Guys.

111
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:53,241
I can't express to you
how important this assembly is.

112
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,981
<i>We need recruits. There are six of you.</i>

113
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:58,182
<i>We need 12 to qualify for regionals.</i>

114
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:01,192
<i>We have no choice,
or the club is over.</i>

115
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,194
I know you guys don't like this song...

116
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:06,163
but we took nationals back in '93
with "Freak Out."

117
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:10,168
<i>It's a crowd-pleaser. Trust me.
From the top.</i>

118
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,170
I'm dead.

119
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:23,712
<i>My father always said you
become a man when you buy your first house.</i>

120
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,717
<i>I'm not sure what he meant by that...</i>

121
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:28,345
<i>since he burned ours down once
after a drunken fight with Mom.</i>

122
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,981
Welcome to your little slice
of the American dream.

123
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,218
I have a question about the trees.

124
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:37,319
It's always been my personal dream
to cut down my own Christmas tree.

125
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,729
How many Christmas trees will we have
in the backyard?

126
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,596
And do they come in different colors?

127
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:44,192
Because, well, obviously
we're expecting a family.

128
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,135
I have a real sense
it might be a girl.

129
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:50,539
<i>Still, I can't believe we're
actually doing this. It all happened so fast.</i>

130
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:57,348
<i>It all started when Terri's sister Kendra
brought her kids over for Sunday brunch.</i>

131
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,716
Well, I just don't understand where
you're planning on putting the nursery.

132
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,153
- I know.
- Well, we have a second bedroom.

133
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:06,988
You are not giving up your craft room,
Terri. A mother needs her respite.

134
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:09,254
That craft room is the only thing
that's gonna keep you from going...

135
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:12,126
all Susan Smith on that little angel.

136
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,393
Postpartum runs in our family.

137
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,059
Where are you going?

138
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:18,535
Bathroom. All that bran.

139
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,869
No, you can't.
Kyle needs his inhaler.

140
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,307
Anyway, this conversation is over.

141
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,644
They're starting construction
on a new section of our subdivision.

142
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:33,879
You are not bringing my niece
or nephew home to this apartment.

143
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,420
When pigs fly.

144
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:38,719
Can I eat this?

145
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,120
This banister was made
by Ecuadorean children.

146
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:47,098
It's great, Terri, but there are
nine foreclosures on our street.

147
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,134
Why can't we buy one of those?
They're half the price.

148
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:53,195
I'm not raising my baby in a used house.
They're not clean.

149
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:56,400
Look at the sun nook.
Isn't it beautiful?

150
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,535
- Is it extra?
- Mmm.

151
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,977
The price in the brochure
is for the basic model.

152
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,242
Everything else is à la carte.

153
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:08,777
The grand foyer is an extra 14,000,
and the sun nook is an extra 24.

154
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,790
I'll let you two talk.

155
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,826
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Hmm.

156
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,660
We can't afford this.

157
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,029
We already did the math, Will.
All we have to do is give up Applebee's...

158
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,068
and we won't run the A.C.
for the first couple of summers.

159
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:26,366
Well, we certainly can't afford
the grand foyer and the sun nook.

160
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,772
I mean, if we bite off more than
we can chew, we'll lose everything.

161
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,833
You need to pick one.

162
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:35,312
Come with me. I'm gonna show you
something really special.

163
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:38,373
<i>This is where our daughter
or gay son will sleep.</i>

164
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,715
<i>I thought maybe we could put
one of those mini pianos in here...</i>

165
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:43,721
and you two could put on shows for me.

166
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,952
I love it, Terri, but we still
can't afford everything.

167
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:52,789
It's my very own Sophie's choice.

168
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:58,030
Fine. I'm gonna give up the sun nook
for the grand foyer.

169
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,038
But I really need
the polished door handles.

170
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:04,542
Think of our family, Will.
This is our dream.

171
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,704
<i>I knew in that moment
that I would do whatever it took...</i>

172
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,011
<i>even if it meant getting a part-time job
to make some extra money...</i>

173
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,711
<i>to make that dream come true.</i>

174
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,777
Let's go sign those papers.

175
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,448
Yes!

176
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,354
- You need to call me before you dress yourself.
- Whatever. Whatever.

177
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:23,418
<i>- You look like a Technicolor zebra.
- You're a hater. That's what you are.</i>

178
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,361
<i>- I look like I'm a part of it.
- You're trying to copy me.</i>

179
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,365
<i>- It looks like I planned it.
- If your hair was longer, you'd have curls.</i>

180
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,367
<i>All right, guys.
How about a little Kanye?</i>

181
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:30,993
Sweet!

182
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,334
- For the assembly?
- No. We won't be ready in time.

183
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,239
We're still doing disco. But we can
fold this into our repertoire...

184
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:39,107
and it'll be awesome at regionals.

185
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:42,875
Communication is the foundation
of any successful music group.

186
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,543
If we're gonna succeed,
we need to communicate.

187
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,586
You guys said you wanted modern music,
I listened.

188
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:51,521
<i>Mr. Schue, we'd really like
to not do disco at that assembly.</i>

189
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,754
- Finn, you're gonna take the solo.
- What? No, I can't do the solo, Mr. Schue.

190
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:57,819
I'm still learning how to walk
and sing at the same time.

191
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,159
No problem.
I'll walk you through it.

192
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:04,862
- Ooh!
- Challenge.

193
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:08,100
- Hey, Mercedes, you know this?
- Oh, I got this.

194
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,939
¶¶ She take my money ¶¶

<i>- ¶¶ But I'm lookin' for the one

00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,679
¶¶ We want prenup ¶¶¶¶
Yeah!

234
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,850
All right, just like that.
Ready?

235
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,899
- Rachel, did you just throw up?
- No.

236
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,738
You missed the toilet.

237
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,540
The girl who was throwing up
before me left that.

238
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:31,242
I tried, but I guess I just don't have
a gag reflex.

239
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,410
One day when you're older,
that'll turn out to be a gift.

240
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,477
Let's have a little chat, okay?

241
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,739
Rachel, bulimia is
a very messy, serious disease.

242
00:12:55,808 --> 00:13:01,178
I don't have bulimia. I tried it
and failed and won't ever attempt it again.

243
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,340
- Okay.
- Grossed me out.

244
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,940
Okay. But I still want to talk about
the feelings that you had...

245
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:08,248
that led up to you wanting
to puke your guts out.

246
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,880
I want to be thinner.

247
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,756
- Prettier, like that Quinn girl.
- Mm-hmm. And, um, why is that?

248
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:17,819
Have you ever liked somebody so much
you just wanna...

249
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,730
lock yourself in your room,
turn on sad music and cry?

250
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,368
No.

251
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:28,770
¶¶ All by my ¶¶

252
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:31,901
<i>- ¶¶ Self ¶¶
- By myself! I'm by myself!</i>

253
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,911
¶¶ Don't wanna be ¶¶¶¶

254
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:38,416
Uh, but a boy crush, huh?
I know about that.

255
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:42,477
I mean, not now. It takes me back in the...
Like a long time ago, I knew about that.

256
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,353
You know what? You need to remember,
Rachel, to protect your heart.

257
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,484
I don't care who he is. If he doesn't like you
for the way you are...

258
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:51,496
If he's... you know, he's married
with a baby on the way...

259
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:56,592
That's not worth the heartache. You don't
want to compromise yourself for that.

260
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,569
Um...

261
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:02,198
Have you just tried
telling him how you feel?

262
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,936
He doesn't even notice me.

263
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:09,971
I see. Um... Okay.
Well, here's what I think.

264
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:13,018
Common interests
are the key to romance.

265
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:17,385
All right? So find out what he likes.
Then he'll see you in a positive way...

266
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:20,118
and maybe you'll end up doing something
that you never would have expected.

267
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:39,305
<i>Would you like to tell
Principal Figgins and Mr. Schuester...</i>

268
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,505
what I caught you two doing?

269
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,071
It just sort of happened.

270
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,349
I don't mean to be rude,
but I think she's overreacting.

271
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,820
You watch your tone, young lady.

272
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,358
Gay parents encourage rebellion.
There are studies on this.

273
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:56,952
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
All right, tell me what happened, Rachel.

274
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:00,192
Finn was worried about having
to perform a solo at the pep assembly...

275
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,496
in front of his chromosomally
challenged friends.

276
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,036
I was immediately concerned
by his lack of self-esteem...

277
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,095
and made a creative preemptive strike.

278
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,140
Yeah, pretty much what she said.

279
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,268
You know, one of the amazing things
about being in the performing arts...

280
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,574
is that you can parlay it
into so many different fields.

281
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,581
Like Justin Timberlake...

282
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,947
He's a singer, but he also
has a clothing line.

283
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:23,421
And, you know, he makes things
like shirts and belts.

284
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,117
<i>- Who's Justin Timberlake?
- It was a twofold plan.</i>

285
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:28,659
<i>We figured that with
the right marketing strategy...</i>

286
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:31,525
<i>we could pull from the entire student body
without having an assembly...</i>

287
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,531
<i>thus creating the diverse Glee Club...</i>

288
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,363
<i>this school has been craving.</i>

289
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,903
That copy machine
is for Cheerios use only.

290
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,071
<i>Paid for by alumni donations.</i>

291
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,411
I can't begin to fathom the damage...

292
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:53,315
you'd have done to the program
had you broken it.

293
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:56,513
- Hold on a second, Sue.
- I resent being told to hold on to anything, William.

294
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:59,819
I will not be treated like a second-class
citizen because of my gender.

295
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:03,589
<i>There is a very clear bureaucracy
when it comes to photocopies...</i>

296
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:07,689
and you seem to think that these
procedures don't apply to your students.

297
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:10,667
It is my strong recommendation
that both these students be hobbled.

298
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:16,907
- How many copies did you guys make?
- Seventeen.

299
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:21,037
- Okay. And how much does a photocopy cost?
- Four and a half cents.

300
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:24,014
- How about they just pay for the copies?
- I like this compromise.

301
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:28,281
Children, pay Ms. Sylvester,
and we'll let you off with a warning.

302
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:31,187
And, Sue, I'm sorry,
but I'll have to ask you...

303
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:34,521
to personally clean the congealed protein
shake off the photocopy room floor.

304
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,220
That's why we have janitors.

305
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,627
Sue, we're in a recession,
and concessions must be made.

306
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,790
I've laid off half the janitorial staff.

307
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:43,357
We all need to lend a hand.

308
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:52,007
Lady Justice wept today.

309
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:57,645
- I'm sorry about that, Mr. Schue.
- I'd like to get the flyers up...

310
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:00,116
- before lunch tomorrow.
- You know what, guys? I don't want to hear it.

311
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,983
Doing that song is gonna
kill any chance the Glee Club has.

312
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,250
- It's a terrible idea.
- I have news for you, Rachel.

313
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,588
Sometimes you have to do
things you don't want to do.

314
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:10,787
We're doing the assembly,
and you're not putting up those flyers.

315
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,058
Everybody loves disco!

316
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:18,159
It's official. I'm a dead man.

317
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:24,965
Look, I know you're nervous,
but you're really, really talented.

318
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,536
- Stop it.
- I mean, maybe it'll all be okay.

319
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,785
Do you want to practice
for the assembly tomorrow after school?

320
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,979
I can't. I got a Celibacy Club meeting.

321
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:46,555
Baby, I have some bad news.

322
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,657
A wealthy relative died?

323
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,964
- I don't have any wealthy relatives.
- Oh.

324
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,698
I've just been pounding the pavement
all week after Glee rehearsal.

325
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:56,900
I-I can't find any extra work.

326
00:17:56,975 --> 00:18:00,433
That probably means no grand foyer.

327
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:03,208
Why can't we ever
be the ones to catch a break?

328
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,216
No, no, no. It's going to be okay, baby.

329
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,014
- I mean, we don't need a grand foyer to be happy.
- No. You know what?

330
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,612
I'm so tired of the compromising.

331
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:13,157
I want my grand foyer.
I want my dream house.

332
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:16,490
I work hard. I sacrifice.
I deserve it.

333
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,896
You know, we give and we give.

334
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,900
Do you think that the big shots
at Sheets 'N' Things care...

335
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,994
<i>that I sell more personal massagers
than any other assistant manager?</i>

336
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,164
No. Or do you think that those kids...

337
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,004
that they give a damn
that we go with so little...

338
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,010
<i>because you spend all your spare time...</i>

339
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:36,206
<i>choreographing those
stupid dance routines?</i>

340
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,842
<i>I mean, when does anyone
start giving back?</i>

341
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:02,931
<i>I thought you asked Sue
to clean up after herself.</i>

342
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,169
<i>Sue got a note from the school nurse...</i>

343
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:09,874
claiming that her lupus made it
impossible to bend over a bucket of suds.

344
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:13,907
<i>I've been here till 10:00 p.m. every night,
up to my elbows in Vamoose!</i>

345
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:22,056
Any problem with me taking over
one of those nighttime janitorial slots?

346
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,293
I'll work at half salary.

347
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,606
The Celibacy Club is now in session.

348
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,803
Thanks to a school rule that says
we have to let anyone join the club...

349
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:43,541
we're welcoming a new member this week...

350
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,549
<i>Rachel What's-her-name.</i>

351
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:48,245
- Where are all the boys?
- Down the hall.

352
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,254
First half hour we separate...

353
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,586
then we come together to share our faith.

354
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:56,560
<i>I'm still on the fence
about the Celibacy Club.</i>

355
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,995
<i>I mean, I only joined to get
into Quinn Fabray's pants.</i>

356
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,898
<i>Still, it is a productive way for us guys...</i>

357
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,959
<i>to get together and talk
about sexual issues.</i>

358
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,268
I think I'm gonna kill myself.
I'm serious.

359
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,868
We're bombarded with sexual imagery
every day... Beer ads, those short skirts.

360
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:14,936
I'm supposed to be
surrounded by temptation...

361
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:18,813
- Not be able to do anything about it?
- Are you kidding?

362
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,614
Those skirts are crunchy toast.

363
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:24,178
Santana Lopez bent over
in hers the other day...

364
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,622
and I swear I could see her ovaries.

365
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,628
God bless the perv that invented these.

366
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,630
Remember the power motto, girls.

367
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,895
It's all about the teasing,
and not about the pleasing.

368
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:39,267
<i>- Oh!
- Back it up like a dump truck, baby!</i>

369
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,499
So, how far does Quinn let you get anyway?

370
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,167
We grind, make out.

371
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,644
But how do you keep from arriving early?

372
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,204
Whenever I grind...

373
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,250
Cinco de Mayo.

374
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:55,218
It's not a problem for me, man.

375
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:59,113
<i>Actually, it's a big problem.</i>

376
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,921
<i>Somebody once told me
that to keep from erupting too early...</i>

377
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,928
<i>you should think
of dead kittens and stuff.</i>

378
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,930
<i>But the only image
that works for me happened...</i>

379
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,466
<i>the day my mom took me out
to practice for my driver's permit.</i>

380
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:12,765
Pretty good, honey.
Who says a father figure's necessary, huh?

381
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,328
- Driving's fun.
- Yeah.

382
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:17,034
Oh, my God!

383
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,304
Oh, my! Oh, my! Oh, my God,
you killed him. What are you gonna do?

384
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,248
Let's pair up for
the "Immaculate Affection."

385
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:27,251
<i>Now, remember, if the balloon pops...</i>

386
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,810
the noise makes the angels cry.

387
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:46,198
<i>- You enchant me.
- Yeah.</i>

388
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:49,365
- Just stop it!
- Take it. Ah, yeah!

389
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,933
- Finn!
- It must have hit my zipper.

390
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:56,447
You know what? This is a joke.

391
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,983
Did you know that most studies
have demonstrated...

392
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,110
that celibacy doesn't work
in high schools?

393
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:04,383
<i>Our hormones are driving us
too crazy to abstain.</i>

394
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,390
<i>The second we start telling ourselves...</i>

395
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,392
<i>that there's no room
for compromise, we act out.</i>

396
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,190
<i>The only way to deal
with teen sexuality is to be prepared.</i>

397
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,197
That's what contraception is for.

398
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,233
Don't you dare mention the "C" word.

399
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:18,292
You want to know a dirty little secret...

400
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,930
that none of them want you to know?

401
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,099
Girls want sex just as much as guys do.

402
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,747
I-Is that accurate?

403
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,415
- Will?
- Aaah!

404
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:44,485
<i>Emma... What are you doing here so late?</i>

405
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:47,992
I do S.A.T. prep on Tuesday nights.

406
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,091
Are you, um... Are you a janitor?

407
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:52,136
Aja... no.

408
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:56,971
Really? 'Cause you're dressed like
a janitor, and your shirt says "Will."

409
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,840
Um, Terri and I are
trying to buy a house...

410
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:02,471
and we're, you know,
struggling to make ends meet, and...

411
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:07,082
<i>I'm really embarrassed.</i>

412
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:11,422
Would you mind keeping this between us?

413
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,424
Yeah.

414
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:16,689
Oh, yeah, your secret's
completely safe with me.

415
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,457
Thank you.

416
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:21,590
Do you, um... Do you want a hand?

417
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,793
Oh... No. I-I'm good, really.

418
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,099
Really? Because I can see from here...

419
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,105
that you've used window cleaner
to mop the floor.

420
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,664
And, uh, that keyboard
is crawling in E.coli...

421
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,710
because I know for a fact Ms. Hoffmeyer...

422
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:35,178
doesn't wash her hands
after doing number twos.

423
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:41,584
I really admire you working
so hard for something you want.

424
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:45,812
Let's make a deal.
You're helping me with my problem.

425
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,882
How about I take a stab at one of yours?

426
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:51,395
Oh, no, I don't...
I don't have a problem.

427
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:54,023
You've been scrubbing
that pencil sharpener for an hour.

428
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,033
Well, I mean, I have...

429
00:23:56,101 --> 00:24:00,970
I have a little trouble with messes,
but it's not like it's a problem.

430
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,779
Okay.

431
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:11,748
When I was a little girl, it was
my dream to work on a dairy farm.

432
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:16,083
- Really?
- Yeah. And when I was eight,
we finally visited one...

433
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:18,520
and after the tour
and the yogurt tasting...

434
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:22,253
my... my brother pushed me
into the runoff lagoon.

435
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:26,058
- What?
- And, um, ever since then, I've just...

436
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,999
I've had a little trouble
forgetting the, uh... the smell.

437
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:35,264
Have you thought about... I don't know...
maybe seeing someone about that?

438
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,501
Oh, no. It's completely manageable.

439
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:41,103
You know, I just... I take lots of showers
and I, um... You know, I don't eat dairy.

440
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:43,113
So it's...

441
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,841
I want to try...

442
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,854
- a little experiment.
- Oh, no.

443
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:55,586
No, I'm not really, um,
comfortable with... with that...

444
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:09,768
There.

445
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,105
Ten seconds.

446
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,270
New record.

447
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,516
It's late. I should, um...

448
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:23,349
I should be, um, going.

449
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:36,299
I officially call this meeting
of Glee Club in session.

450
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,495
- But Mr. Schuester isn't here.
- Mr. Schuester isn't coming.

451
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,004
I paid a freshman to ask him
for help with irregular verbs.

452
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:44,633
<i>Ugh! I'm so sick of hearing you
squawk, Eva Perón.</i>

453
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,643
Let her talk.

454
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,840
I have another idea for the assembly.

455
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:54,079
Can I, once again, stress my most strenuous
objections to this attempted suicide?

456
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:56,985
They're not gonna kill us... Because we're
gonna give them what they want.

457
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,989
- Blood?
- Better.

458
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,685
Sex.

459
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:06,824
Silence, children. Silence.

460
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,298
<i>First, an announcement.</i>

461
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:11,927
The toilets are broken again.

462
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:15,734
We are fixing the problem.
But let me warn you...

463
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:20,608
there will be zero tolerance
for anyone soiling school grounds.

464
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,546
<i>We're not going to have
a repeat of last time.</i>

465
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:26,880
<i>We have a treat for you guys today.</i>

466
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:29,978
- Mr. Schuester.
- Yea, Glee!

467
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:32,990
- Glee kids, hooray!
- Uh, hi.

468
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:37,222
Uh, when I went to school here,
Glee Club ruled this place.

469
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,229
And we're on our way back.

470
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:41,128
<i>But we need some recruits
to join the party.</i>

471
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:46,569
Now, I could tell you all about
how great Glee is, but, uh...

472
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:50,039
I think I'm gonna let some
friends of mine show you instead.

473
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:58,378
¶¶ Get up on this ¶¶

474
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,680
<i>¶¶ Get up on this ¶¶</i>

475
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:04,051
<i>¶¶ Baby, baby
B- Baby, baby ¶¶</i>

476
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,919
¶¶ Ooh, baby, baby ¶¶

477
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:07,891
<i>¶¶ B-Baby, baby ¶¶</i>

478
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,587
- ¶¶ Get up on this ¶¶
- Hey!

479
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:13,392
<i>- ¶¶ Get up on this ¶¶
- ¶¶ Push it ¶¶</i>

480
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,229
¶¶ Sa-Sa-Sa-Salt-N-Pepa's here ¶¶

481
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,326
Now, wait a minute, y'all.

482
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:20,337
Now, this dance ain't for everybody.

483
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:24,205
Only the sexy people.

484
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:26,209
So all you fly mothers...

485
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:28,268
get on out there and dance.

486
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:30,712
- Dance, I said! Holla.
- ¶¶ Sa-Salt-N-Pepa's here ¶¶

487
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:34,513
¶¶ And we're in effect
Want you to push it, babe ¶¶

488
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:37,578
¶¶ Coolin' by day
Then at night workin' up a sweat ¶¶

489
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,955
¶¶ Come on, girls
Let's go show the guys that we know ¶¶

490
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:44,757
<i>¶¶ How to become number one
in a hot party show ¶¶</i>

491
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,354
<i>- ¶¶ Now, push it ¶¶
- ¶¶ Push it ¶¶</i>

492
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:51,129
<i>- ¶¶ Push it good ¶¶
- ¶¶ Ah, push it ¶¶</i>

493
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:55,070
<i>- ¶¶ Push it real good ¶¶
- ¶¶ Ah, push it ¶¶</i>

494
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,598
<i>- ¶¶ Push it good ¶¶
- ¶¶ Ah, push it ¶¶</i>

495
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:02,306
<i>- ¶¶ Pu-Push it real good ¶¶
- ¶¶ Ah, push it ¶¶</i>

496
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,940
<i>- ¶¶ Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh ¶¶
- ¶¶ Get up on this ¶¶</i>

497
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,883
- Hey!
- ¶¶ Get up on this ¶¶

498
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:11,251
¶¶ Yo, baby pop, yeah, you
Come here, give me a kiss ¶¶

499
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:15,122
<i>¶¶ Better make it fast
or else I'm gonna get pissed ¶¶</i>

500
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,286
¶¶ Can you hear the music
pumpin' hard ¶¶

501
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,126
¶¶ Like I wish you would
Now push it ¶¶

502
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,565
<i>- ¶¶ Ah, push it ¶¶
- ¶¶ Push it good ¶¶</i>

503
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:26,661
- ¶¶ Ah, push it ¶¶
- ¶¶ Push it real good ¶¶

504
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:31,072
- ¶¶ Ah, push it ¶¶
- ¶¶ Push it good ¶¶

505
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:34,634
- ¶¶ Ah, push it ¶¶
- ¶¶ Pu-Push it real good ¶¶

506
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,442
¶¶ Ah, push it ¶¶

507
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:38,311
<i>¶¶ Get up on this ¶¶</i>

508
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,011
<i>¶¶ Ah, push it ¶¶</i>

509
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,452
- ¶¶ Get up on this ¶¶
- Holla!

510
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:47,287
- ¶¶ Get up on this ¶¶
- ¶¶ Ah, push it ¶¶

511
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:49,849
- Hey!
- ¶¶ Ah, push it ¶¶¶¶

512
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:56,132
Yes!

513
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:12,012
Let me be the one to break the silence.

514
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:16,281
That was the most offensive thing
I've seen in 20 years of teaching...

515
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:19,323
<i>And that includes an elementary school
production of Hair.</i>

516
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:22,621
We've received angry e-mails
from a number of concerned parents...

517
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:25,527
<i>many of whom thought that
their children were going to hear...</i>

518
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,896
a Special Olympian speak
about overcoming adversity.

519
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:31,162
I-I really don't know what to say.

520
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:33,704
Well, let me help you out then.

521
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:37,708
<i>My first thought was that your students
should be put into foster care.</i>

522
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:41,774
But you're the one who should be punished.

523
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:44,314
I demand your resignation
from this school...

524
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:47,715
as well as the disbanding of Glee Club.

525
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,552
Now, hold on, Sue. The issue is content.
Those kids are talented.

526
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,649
<i>And I have not seen
the student body this excited...</i>

527
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:57,524
since Tiffany performed
at the North Hills Mall.

528
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:01,095
I took the liberty of calling my pastor...

529
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,691
to provide a list
of family-friendly songs...

530
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:05,998
<i>that reflect our community's values.</i>

531
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,561
Your kids can only perform these
preapproved musical selections.

532
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,236
But all these songs have either
"Jesus" or "balloons" in the title.

533
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,336
But there are also songs about the circus.

534
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:19,747
<i>This egg is sunny-side up, Will.
You need new outfits.</i>

535
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,013
<i>I got several flashes of panty
from your group today...</i>

536
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:24,577
and I'm not talking about the girls.

537
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,420
<i>So, Sue, I'm cutting
your dry-cleaning budget...</i>

538
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,858
to pay for new costumes for the Glee Club.

539
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:33,386
- This will not stand.
- Oh, Sue.

540
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:36,365
The dry-cleaners here are just as good
as the ones in Europe.

541
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:48,641
- Mr. Schuester, I'm so sorry.
- Do you understand what you did today?

542
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:50,681
You lied to me.
And you ruined our chances.

543
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:53,615
No parent in their right mind
is gonna let their kid join Glee now.

544
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,210
Oh, and, uh, here's a list of the songs
that we're allowed to sing.

545
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:58,380
<i>What's a "Luftballon"?</i>

546
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,947
Look, I know how much
you care about Glee Club...

547
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,653
and I understand why
you did what you did...

548
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:06,754
but I don't like the way you did it.

549
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,816
They're for Tulip-A-Looza.

550
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,879
It's a tulip festival down at
the Columbus Convention Center.

551
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:34,424
- It's supposed to smell pretty nice.
- That's really sweet of you...

552
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:37,154
but I have... a-asthma.

553
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:41,164
What are you doing?
Chasing a married guy.

554
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,925
I saw you playing house
with him after hours, Emma.

555
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:48,769
Look. I don't know a lot
about relationships.

556
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,206
Most of mine are short and
flame out once the sex goes...

557
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,506
but I do know you never want
to be the rebounder.

558
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,280
I'm a good man, Emma.

559
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:59,680
I'll treat you right.
I'll put up with all your crazy.

560
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,844
They can't fire me
'cause I'm a minority...

561
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,649
so I'll always be able to provide for you.

562
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:05,621
You could do a lot worse...

563
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,284
and in this town,
you're not gonna do much better.

564
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,662
Okay, I'm done talking now.

565
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,035
- Try it.
- ¶¶ La ¶¶

566
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,035
<i>- Good.
- That was good.</i>

567
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:23,073
- Okay, one more up.
- ¶¶ La ¶¶

568
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:24,802
<i>- That was really good.
- Is that okay?</i>

569
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:28,744
Yeah, it's like the holy grail
for a baritenor, so it's a good note.

570
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:32,010
All right, I'll start at the bottom,
and then we'll go up higher.

571
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:34,244
Can we take a break?
Singing kind of makes me a little hungry.

572
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:37,345
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Lucky I prepared for that.

573
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:39,686
Wow. I was wondering
what that was all about.

574
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:43,022
- Want to sit?
- Yeah, yeah.

575
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:45,028
Absolutely.

576
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:48,224
I was wondering why you asked me
to help you with your singing.

577
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:51,200
You kicked butt at the assembly.

578
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:55,933
Well, this is my only chance to be,
you know, good like you.

579
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:59,100
You think I'm good?

580
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:01,611
Well, when I first joined,
I thought you were kind of insane.

581
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,113
You talk a lot more than you should,
and to be honest with you...

582
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:08,209
I looked under the bed and made sure
that you weren't hanging out under there.

583
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,546
But then I heard you sing.

584
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:15,023
I don't know how to say this,
but you touched something in me.

585
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:18,719
Right here.

586
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:23,058
Your heart's on the other side
of your chest.

587
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:25,830
Oh.

588
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:28,030
It's beating really hard.

589
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:32,474
You're cool, Rachel.

590
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:35,535
- Do you want a drink?
- Yeah.

591
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:41,116
- Virgin Cosmos.
- Cool.

592
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,745
That stuff you said at the Celibacy Club...
That was really cool.

593
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,652
Thanks.

594
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:50,593
- Well, cheers.
- Cheers.

595
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:53,630
Cups are like the airplane cups.

596
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:59,402
Oh, you got a little Cosmo right...

597
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,440
You know, you can kiss me if you want to.

598
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:13,040
I want to.

599
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,940
What?

600
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,841
Oh, my God!

601
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,175
Did I do something wrong?

602
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,544
No, no. Um, I just gotta go.

603
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:47,641
Look, please don't tell anybody
about this, okay?

604
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,727
I don't want my baby to grow
an extra arm just because...

605
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:03,130
<i>I live in squalor and I'm so stressed.</i>

606
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,829
So, I want you to run
any and all tests you have.

607
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:08,895
- Trust me. You're clear.
- Are you sure?

608
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:11,908
- Positive.
- Is it a boy or a girl?

609
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:13,910
Um...

610
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:18,080
Don't quite know how to put this.

611
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:20,845
- There's no baby.
- Did it fall out?

612
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:25,351
Uh, no. Uh, you're not pregnant.

613
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:28,187
- But I've gained 10 pounds.
- It's probably from eating.

614
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:31,092
I can see a chicken wing in there
that you must have swallowed whole.

615
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:33,392
You're having what's called
a hysterical pregnancy.

616
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:38,026
You want a baby so badly that
your body mimics the symptoms.

617
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:44,166
If you're meant
to get pregnant, it'll happen.

618
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,052
I have to say, I'm really surprised
you guys are trying out.

619
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,384
I'm sure you've read about this
in the school paper.

620
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:00,822
Finn and I have been
an item for a while now.

621
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:04,191
So what kind of girlfriend
would I be if I didn't support him?

622
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:06,890
Well, let's see what you got.

623
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:18,374
¶¶ Say a little prayer for you ¶¶

624
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:21,468
¶¶ The moment I wake up ¶¶

625
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:25,141

00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:31,816
¶¶ While combing my hair now ¶¶

628
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:35,791
- ¶¶ And wonder what dress to wear now ¶¶
- ¶¶ Wear now ¶¶

629
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,091
- ¶¶ I say a little ¶¶
- ¶¶ Prayer for you ¶¶

630
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:40,892

¶¶ You'll stay in my heart

¶¶ For me ¶¶¶¶

637
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:01,181
<i>Let me get this straight.
You're joining Glee Club?</i>

638
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:03,117
I'm sorry, Coach Sylvester...

639
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:05,781
but something is going on
between Finn and that thing.

640
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:09,314
You saw how it was
undressing him with its eyes.

641
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,623
Please don't kick us off the Cheerios.

642
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:15,325
Cease fire on the waterworks.
I don't want to hear it. I don't want to see it.

643
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,993
You know, Q. when I first
laid eyes on you...

644
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,629
I was reminded of a young Sue Sylvester...

645
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,866
though you don't have my bone structure.

646
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,602
But it wasn't until this very moment...

647
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:29,045
I saw how alike we really are.

648
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,550
You three are going to be my spies.

649
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:35,950
I need eyes on the inside.

650
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,853
We're going to bring
this club down from within.

651
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,053
And I'm gonna get my boyfriend back.

652
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:47,154
I don't care so much about that.

653
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:56,867
Hey, Emma. Guess what.

654
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,136
I found these new
disinfecting bleach wipes.

655
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,041
What do you say?

656
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:05,173
Boy's bathroom in the science wing? 9:00?

657
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:08,707
Will, what are we doing?

658
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,983
I mean, you're having a baby.

659
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:17,486
Um, and anyway, uh...

660
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:20,052
- I have a date.
- Oh, that's great.

661
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,599
- Yeah.
- Yeah. With who?

662
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,999
I'm gonna go to Tulip-A-Looza.

663
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:27,003
With Ken.

664
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,424
<i>There's my man.</i>

665
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,461
Bringing home the bacon.

666
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:53,759
You... You made dinner.

667
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,765
I thought you'd be asleep.

668
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,165
Well, I wanted to talk
to you about something...

669
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:01,932
so I made you chicken pot pie...
from scratch.

670
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,776
Terri, that's so thoughtful. I...

671
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:10,611
Yeah, you know, I've been
working so hard lately, some...

672
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,945
Sometimes I forget what I'm doing it for.

673
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,645
Family's what's important to me.

674
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,554
You and the little guy or gal on the way.

675
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:22,456
- I hope you know that.
- Yeah.

676
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,723
I'm sorry. What was it
you wanted to talk about?

677
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:28,788
I went to the baby doctor today.

678
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:32,393
- And?
- And...

679
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,436
it's a boy.

680
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,470
- Oh, my God. Terri, that's amazing.
- Yeah.

681
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,944
Oh, my God. Oh!

682
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:46,244
Uh, I want you to give up being a janitor.

683
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:48,945
- What?
- Yeah. We don't need a new house.

684
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,987
We'll turn my craft room into a nursery.

685
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,853
- It's a compromise that I want to make.
- Really?

686
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:55,949
Yeah.

687
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:59,928
You know, the only project
that I want to work on now is us.

688
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,167
I love you so much.

689
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:17,337
You're giving Quinn Fabray the solo?
That's my solo.

690
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,782
You made this happen, Rachel. You were the
one who wanted to sell sex at the assembly.

691
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:23,342
Quinn's audition song was
on Figgins's approved list...

692
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,390
- and frankly, she did a heck of a job singing it.
- You're punishing me.

693
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:30,120
Contrary to your beliefs,
it's not all about you.

694
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:34,358
Or, I've realized, about me.

695
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:37,300
Look, I screwed up too.

696
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:40,360
I'm as responsible for what you did
at that assembly as you are.

697
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,463
I should never have pushed disco so hard.

698
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,974
When we did it back in '93...

699
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:47,670
the disco revival was in its heyday.

700
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:50,077
It was cool. We had fun.

701
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:54,083
And that... That is what Glee
is supposed to be about.

702
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:58,884
If we're gonna succeed,
we both need to change our mind sets.

703
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,390
You're not always gonna be the star.

704
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,690
But I promise to do my best
to make sure you're always having fun.

705
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:06,923
<i>This is a good thing, Rachel.</i>

706
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:09,192
We're on our way.

707
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:13,100
Can I use the auditorium later to practice?

708
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,263
Our neighbors are filing a lawsuit.

709
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:17,170
Sure.

710
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:34,113
