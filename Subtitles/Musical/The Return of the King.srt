1
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,565
Hear you now...

2
00:00:24,935 --> 00:00:27,165
...a story of good against evil.

3
00:00:27,671 --> 00:00:30,435
An epoch that has its beginning
at an ending...

4
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,804
...and ends at a beginning.

5
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,738
Listen, as we speak of the fall
of a lord of darkness...

6
00:00:37,147 --> 00:00:39,411
...and the return of a king of light.

7
00:00:40,183 --> 00:00:43,050
Concern yourselves
with armies and wizards...

8
00:00:43,487 --> 00:00:45,250
...phantoms and emperors...

9
00:00:45,322 --> 00:00:49,520
...cloud-capped towers
and bloodied fields of horrendous carnage.

10
00:00:50,594 --> 00:00:52,118
Consider no less...

11
00:00:52,195 --> 00:00:54,026
...than the cataclysmic transformation...

12
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:56,793
...of that ancient world
of wonder and magic...

13
00:00:57,067 --> 00:00:59,695
...to the world we know now, of Man.

14
00:01:00,971 --> 00:01:03,701
What mighty lord, you may ask,
is hero enough...

15
00:01:03,907 --> 00:01:06,842
...to evoke such cosmic metamorphosis?

16
00:01:09,813 --> 00:01:12,680
Why, no lord at all,
but the littlest of fellows...

17
00:01:13,483 --> 00:01:15,007
...Frodo the Hobbit...

18
00:01:15,085 --> 00:01:17,280
...and his faithful squire, Samwise.

19
00:01:18,422 --> 00:01:21,789
Who, beginning at the ending,
now approach Rivendell...

20
00:01:22,059 --> 00:01:24,050
...the Elvish home of Elrond...

21
00:01:24,328 --> 00:01:27,354
...there to help celebrate
the 129th birthday...

22
00:01:27,898 --> 00:01:29,798
...of Frodo's aged kin...

23
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:33,825
...Bilbo Baggins,
renowned tormentor of dragons.

24
00:01:34,504 --> 00:01:39,464
Bless my soul!
You're a match for Smaug himself.

25
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:50,012
All of us, Frodo and Samwise...

26
00:01:50,587 --> 00:01:53,283
...their Hobbit companions,
Merry and Pippin...

27
00:01:53,457 --> 00:01:56,984
...Elrond the Elf-Lord, and I, Gandalf...

28
00:01:57,628 --> 00:01:59,823
...wished Bilbo only the best.

29
00:02:00,897 --> 00:02:03,263
But as we celebrated
far into the Elvish night...

30
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:06,894
...we found it difficult
to keep our aging guest of honor awake.

31
00:02:07,871 --> 00:02:10,339
Nay, Pippin. Not till Bilbo has cut it.

32
00:02:10,607 --> 00:02:13,701
Blast. What a time to fall asleep.

33
00:02:14,077 --> 00:02:15,544
Who's asleep?

34
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:17,872
Just resting my eyes...

35
00:02:18,248 --> 00:02:20,307
...and remembering.

36
00:02:21,818 --> 00:02:23,945
There And Back Again...

37
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:26,453
...and what happened after.

38
00:02:26,857 --> 00:02:28,222
Remembering, sir?

39
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,149
So many things.

40
00:02:30,427 --> 00:02:32,054
Old Smaug...

41
00:02:32,663 --> 00:02:34,426
...dear Thorin...

42
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:37,227
...that terrible Gollum chap...

43
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:40,228
...the Ring of Invisibility.

44
00:02:41,204 --> 00:02:43,195
What's become of my ring?

45
00:02:43,774 --> 00:02:46,709
That ring I gave you and you took away.

46
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,334
Yes.

47
00:02:48,412 --> 00:02:50,403
I've lost it, Bilbo dear.

48
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:52,012
I got rid of it, you know.

49
00:02:52,482 --> 00:02:55,918
Pity. I should have liked to see it again.

50
00:02:56,553 --> 00:02:57,577
But...

51
00:02:57,654 --> 00:03:00,088
...now, how silly of me.

52
00:03:00,657 --> 00:03:02,818
That's what you went for, wasn't it?

53
00:03:02,893 --> 00:03:04,520
To get rid of it.

54
00:03:05,262 --> 00:03:10,256
But why destroy a thing
of such wondrous magic?

55
00:03:10,734 --> 00:03:12,759
It was an evil thing, sir.

56
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:14,061
Nay!

57
00:03:14,137 --> 00:03:15,968
Without its powers...

58
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:19,905
...I could never have faced
the worm, Smaug.

59
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,310
You unwittingly used its
evil forces for good, dear Uncle.

60
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:26,572
Your innocence protected you.

61
00:03:26,817 --> 00:03:28,910
But had you continued to wear it...

62
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:31,715
...instead of keeping it
above your mantle as a trophy...

63
00:03:32,055 --> 00:03:35,616
...its ever-growing malignancy
would have consumed you...

64
00:03:36,026 --> 00:03:40,963
...as it almost consumed Samwise and me
and the whole of Middle-earth.

65
00:03:41,298 --> 00:03:44,734
But this is all so confusing.

66
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:48,333
So confusing.

67
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:52,675
- Will he never cut the cake?
- Patience, Merry.

68
00:03:53,543 --> 00:03:55,511
Me for a good smoke, while we wait.

69
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:58,275
- What say, master?
- Good notion, Sam.

70
00:04:00,884 --> 00:04:02,977
Bless my soul!

71
00:04:04,755 --> 00:04:08,156
You are missing a finger!

72
00:04:09,693 --> 00:04:12,457
You not only lost my ring...

73
00:04:12,863 --> 00:04:16,060
...you lost the finger on which it rode?

74
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:20,259
Frodo, you must explain.

75
00:04:20,971 --> 00:04:22,563
We have brought with us someone...

76
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,540
...who has written a ballad
about the adventures of Frodo:

77
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:27,440
The Minstrel of Gondor.

78
00:04:29,913 --> 00:04:33,815
"Frodo of the nine fingers

79
00:04:34,351 --> 00:04:37,650
"And the Ring of Doom"

80
00:04:41,358 --> 00:04:43,724
It has its beginnings two ages past...

81
00:04:43,894 --> 00:04:46,988
...when Bilbo set forth to reclaim
the Dwarves' gold...

82
00:04:47,063 --> 00:04:49,122
...from the dragon, Smaug.

83
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:57,963
While on his quest,
Bilbo stumbled into a deep, dank cave.

84
00:04:59,776 --> 00:05:02,404
This part I remember.

85
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:07,180
"When Bilbo found that shiny ring

86
00:05:07,951 --> 00:05:10,886
"In Gollum's cave of gloom

87
00:05:11,655 --> 00:05:13,247
"He never thought

88
00:05:13,723 --> 00:05:18,683
"That it would turn into a ring of doom

89
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:23,360
"The dragon Smaug
The spiders too

90
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:26,568
"The Goblins, the Elven-king

91
00:05:27,437 --> 00:05:30,429
"They came to know the power

92
00:05:30,507 --> 00:05:34,876
"Of the Hobbit and his ring

93
00:05:43,954 --> 00:05:47,617
"Frodo of the nine fingers

94
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:51,551
"And the Ring of Doom

95
00:05:51,795 --> 00:05:54,764
"It started with a Hobbit

96
00:05:55,432 --> 00:05:58,924
"In Gollum's cave of gloom

97
00:06:01,972 --> 00:06:05,169
"The power of the Ring, it grew

98
00:06:05,942 --> 00:06:08,433
"And Gandalf sat in thought

99
00:06:09,646 --> 00:06:13,275
"He knew that it must be destroyed

100
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,483
"In fires where it was wrought

101
00:06:17,754 --> 00:06:21,383
"For if in evil hands it fell

102
00:06:21,892 --> 00:06:24,884
"The Earth would know its end

103
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:29,426
"No force of arms would win the day

104
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:32,996
"No army could contend"

105
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:40,299
For evil flourished everywhere...

106
00:06:41,177 --> 00:06:44,044
...and lay on the land
like a festering malignancy.

107
00:06:44,948 --> 00:06:46,677
There was one hope, though:

108
00:06:47,284 --> 00:06:49,650
In a distant land, the noble Aragorn...

109
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:51,845
...heir to the empty throne of Gondor...

110
00:06:52,422 --> 00:06:55,880
...awaited with a small band
to return and become king.

111
00:06:57,093 --> 00:07:00,119
But he could not triumph
until the Ring was destroyed.

112
00:07:00,497 --> 00:07:02,089
So went the prophecy.

113
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,965
"Frodo of the nine fingers

114
00:07:07,604 --> 00:07:09,868
"And the Ring of Doom

115
00:07:11,007 --> 00:07:14,170
"Accepted a heavy burden

116
00:07:14,611 --> 00:07:17,842
"For the fires to consume"

117
00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:25,247
Frodo and his gallant
companion, Samwise...

118
00:07:25,322 --> 00:07:27,586
...had many brave adventures...

119
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:31,325
...until finally they reached
the rocky border of Mordor...

120
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:34,186
...domain of the Black Lord, Sauron.

121
00:07:35,732 --> 00:07:39,566
There, Frodo was captured and imprisoned
in the Tower of Cirith Ungol.

122
00:07:40,236 --> 00:07:44,263
Samwise vowed to enter
the Orc-infested tower alone...

123
00:07:44,341 --> 00:07:45,399
...to save him.

124
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:56,251
The Ring of Doom was missing...

125
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,843
...from 'round Frodo's neck!

126
00:07:58,455 --> 00:08:02,186
"Frodo of the nine fingers

127
00:08:02,892 --> 00:08:05,952
"And the Ring of Doom

128
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:09,858
"Why does he have nine fingers?

129
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:15,027
"Where is the Ring of Doom?"

130
00:08:36,793 --> 00:08:41,287
One tiny Hobbit against all the evil
the world could muster.

131
00:08:42,332 --> 00:08:44,425
A sane being would have given up.

132
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:47,995
But Samwise burned
with a magnificent madness...

133
00:08:48,405 --> 00:08:51,397
...a glowing obsession
to surmount every obstacle...

134
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:56,073
...to find Frodo, destroy the Ring,
and cleanse Middle-earth...

135
00:08:56,146 --> 00:08:58,273
...of its festering malignancy.

136
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:05,183
He knew he would try again,
fail perhaps and try once more...

137
00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:08,885
...a thousand, thousand times, if need be.

138
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:11,620
But he would not give up the quest.

139
00:11:06,943 --> 00:11:09,468
You cannot die, Master Frodo!

140
00:11:10,413 --> 00:11:12,347
I'll get to you somehow!

141
00:11:26,596 --> 00:11:31,556
You. I can feel you
throbbing with excitement!

142
00:11:32,635 --> 00:11:37,436
You know the gates to the land
of Mordor and your dark lord, Sauron.

143
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:43,240
Now I must bear your loathsome weight.

144
00:11:44,547 --> 00:11:48,540
But I do it for he who lies
in that accursed tower...

145
00:11:48,718 --> 00:11:50,709
...Cirith Ungol:

146
00:11:51,588 --> 00:11:54,352
My sweet master, Frodo.

147
00:11:57,961 --> 00:11:59,690
And, 'tis Sting...

148
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:02,227
...Master Frodo's sword.

149
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:04,528
And his hero's cloak!

150
00:12:05,902 --> 00:12:08,735
Lost 'em with the Ring
while doing battle, he did.

151
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:12,997
They're safe with me
till I find you again, master!

152
00:12:15,144 --> 00:12:16,634
He can't hear.

153
00:12:17,413 --> 00:12:20,109
Half dead, behind walls of stone.

154
00:12:21,918 --> 00:12:25,615
Serve me, Sting, till I can return you.

155
00:12:30,893 --> 00:12:31,917
Here now.

156
00:12:32,328 --> 00:12:33,693
What's this?

157
00:12:35,064 --> 00:12:37,157
Dank and foul-smelling...

158
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:39,796
...but it may be a way in.

159
00:12:51,547 --> 00:12:53,640
I've got through!

160
00:12:55,084 --> 00:12:58,110
So I've finally crossed into Mordor.

161
00:13:06,362 --> 00:13:08,023
Orcs in the tower!

162
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:11,494
Old Bilbo called them Goblins.

163
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:17,206
But whatever the name,
I loathe the vile creatures.

164
00:13:20,943 --> 00:13:22,672
Fighting among themselves?

165
00:13:23,646 --> 00:13:25,307
I could get in!

166
00:13:25,782 --> 00:13:27,477
They wouldn't notice me!

167
00:13:30,887 --> 00:13:33,048
The Ring holds me back?

168
00:13:35,158 --> 00:13:36,147
True.

169
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,093
Once the Orcs saw me...

170
00:13:39,162 --> 00:13:42,598
...they'd forget their own arguments
for the head of an enemy!

171
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:46,630
Useless to face such odds.

172
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,697
Don't take any chances.

173
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:50,871
Destroy the thing yourself.

174
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:54,868
I do it for you, Frodo!

175
00:13:55,411 --> 00:13:57,641
I must be ring bearer now!

176
00:14:02,852 --> 00:14:05,548
"The bearer of the Ring

177
00:14:05,621 --> 00:14:08,283
"The wearer of the Ring

178
00:14:08,391 --> 00:14:13,522
"Stands on the very brink of fate

179
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:19,057
"Staring into eyes of darkness and despair

"That rise and shrink with hate"

181
00:14:30,213 --> 00:14:34,309
I can feel you change
as we draw near the great furnaces...

182
00:14:34,484 --> 00:14:38,420
...where in the depths of time,
you were shaped and formed.

183
00:14:40,723 --> 00:14:42,088
Mount Doom!

184
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:49,826
I could claim you, Ring!

185
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,894
I would be Samwise the Strong!

186
00:14:57,774 --> 00:15:00,265
"The bearer of the Ring

187
00:15:00,343 --> 00:15:03,073
"The wearer of the Ring

188
00:15:03,146 --> 00:15:07,105
"He hears a voice compelling him

189
00:15:08,918 --> 00:15:13,912
"Filling him with thoughts
That echo in his mind

190
00:15:14,123 --> 00:15:18,355
"It should be telling him

191
00:15:19,695 --> 00:15:24,598
"Beware the power
is a power never known

192
00:15:25,001 --> 00:15:28,698
"Beware the power that was simple

193
00:15:28,771 --> 00:15:30,398
"Now has grown

194
00:15:30,506 --> 00:15:34,237
"Beware, bearer of the Ring

195
00:15:35,244 --> 00:15:40,079
"The final power has yet to be shown

196
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:43,942
"The bearer of the Ring

197
00:15:44,253 --> 00:15:46,380
"The wearer of the Ring

198
00:15:46,956 --> 00:15:50,619
"Through forces tempting to resist

199
00:15:52,762 --> 00:15:54,457
"Must recall the quest

200
00:15:55,097 --> 00:15:57,361
"To end this darkest age

201
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,836
"That mortal death has kissed

202
00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:05,907
"The bearer of the Ring

203
00:16:06,142 --> 00:16:08,736
"The wearer of the Ring

204
00:16:08,811 --> 00:16:13,748
"Beware who wears the Ring"

205
00:16:21,324 --> 00:16:24,054
Hail Samwise the Strong!

206
00:16:24,494 --> 00:16:26,792
Hail the Conqueror!

207
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:29,159
Hail the War-King!

208
00:16:29,398 --> 00:16:31,423
Hero of the Age!

209
00:16:31,968 --> 00:16:34,334
To the Dark Tower!

210
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,404
To Barad-dur!

211
00:16:46,883 --> 00:16:49,579
I claim thee, Barad-dur!

212
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:52,917
You are Sauron's no more!

213
00:16:59,028 --> 00:17:01,462
Hail Samwise the Strong!

214
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:04,692
The sun shines for thee alone!

215
00:17:08,538 --> 00:17:13,407
And now I claim all
of the Vale of Gorgoroth!

216
00:17:15,311 --> 00:17:18,610
Now let this foul desolation...

217
00:17:18,781 --> 00:17:22,080
...this cursed plateau
of the Dark Lord, Sauron...

218
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:25,778
...this Orc-infested,
desert of nameless horrors...

219
00:17:26,055 --> 00:17:29,855
...let it blossom forth, and live!

220
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:34,059
Let it live for Samwise the Strong!

221
00:17:36,866 --> 00:17:39,357
Samwise the Strong!

222
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,704
Behold!

223
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:56,746
The gardens of my delight!

224
00:17:57,353 --> 00:18:01,585
So I shall transform the world!

225
00:18:11,434 --> 00:18:14,198
All could be mine...

226
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:18,566
...if I but claim thee, Ring!

227
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,004
No!

228
00:18:33,956 --> 00:18:35,753
What brought me back?

229
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,519
Plain Hobbit sense.

230
00:18:40,963 --> 00:18:44,990
I know in my heart I'm not
enough to bear such a burden.

231
00:18:46,802 --> 00:18:49,498
One small garden of a free gardener...

232
00:18:49,739 --> 00:18:51,900
...is all my need and due.

233
00:18:52,975 --> 00:18:54,840
My own hands to use...

234
00:18:55,678 --> 00:18:58,112
...not the hands of others to command.

235
00:20:17,326 --> 00:20:20,318
No, such a quest is not for me.

236
00:20:21,464 --> 00:20:22,624
Frodo lives.

237
00:20:23,232 --> 00:20:25,826
And only he knows
how to destroy the Ring...

238
00:20:25,968 --> 00:20:27,697
...in the Cracks of Doom.

239
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,833
Only he can find the fire.

240
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:34,075
Dear Master Frodo.

241
00:20:34,677 --> 00:20:36,406
I will find you.

242
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:38,368
Somehow.

243
00:20:49,992 --> 00:20:52,859
An ancient world of towered fortress cities.

244
00:20:53,395 --> 00:20:54,589
Cirith Ungol...

245
00:20:54,663 --> 00:20:57,393
...guarding the entrance
to the lands of Mordor.

246
00:20:58,968 --> 00:21:02,495
Barad-dur, palace of the Dark Lord, Sauron.

247
00:21:02,972 --> 00:21:05,065
And now, look you to yet another.

248
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:09,744
Minas-Tirith, chief city of Gondor...

249
00:21:10,246 --> 00:21:13,545
...last bastion of hope
for the powers of light and good.

250
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:26,320
From the battlement atop the citadel,
like a mariner in a mountainous ship...

251
00:21:26,395 --> 00:21:30,798
...one could look sheer down
upon the gate 700 feet below.

252
00:21:31,734 --> 00:21:33,725
And still this was not the top.

253
00:21:35,371 --> 00:21:37,965
Behold! The White Tower.

254
00:21:41,377 --> 00:21:45,575
At the top, the banner of the stewards
who governed the city...

255
00:21:45,815 --> 00:21:49,808
...its silken arms embracing
a domain more fitting Gwaihir...

256
00:21:50,186 --> 00:21:53,212
...Lord of the Eagles
than those whose emblem it bore.

257
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,785
All this, Minas-Tirith was.

258
00:22:00,996 --> 00:22:04,762
But now, under siege,
the sparkling gem of Gondor...

259
00:22:04,934 --> 00:22:08,370
...had become dull and flawed
with the hell of war.

260
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:14,506
The once-lush fields of Pelennor,
now a wasted battleground...

261
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:19,509
...upon which Sauron's forces of evil
celebrated their victories.

262
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:30,957
Far superior in number
to the battle-ravaged Gondor forces...

263
00:22:31,293 --> 00:22:33,659
...they mounted their monster oliphaunts...

264
00:22:33,796 --> 00:22:38,790
...to ride in the rocking, armored towers,
to their almost certain victory.

265
00:22:40,069 --> 00:22:43,971
And in the heavens,
where no living thing dare now venture...

266
00:22:44,807 --> 00:22:49,801
...Sauron's phantom lieutenants,
the Nazgul, astride their devil steeds...

267
00:22:50,613 --> 00:22:53,707
...scream battle cries
of vile encouragement.

268
00:23:10,499 --> 00:23:15,095
High in the White Tower, Lord Denethor,
Chief Steward of Gondor...

269
00:23:15,271 --> 00:23:18,138
...his mind broken
as his city crumbled about him...

270
00:23:18,207 --> 00:23:21,142
...had succumbed
to an eerie fire of the brain...

271
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:24,873
...and, in his madness,
ordered his own execution.

272
00:23:27,082 --> 00:23:30,108
- You must stop him!
- His word is law!

273
00:23:30,219 --> 00:23:31,880
I'll find Gandalf!

274
00:23:33,722 --> 00:23:37,749
The Hobbit, Pippin, who had proved
a most valuable assistant for me...

275
00:23:37,927 --> 00:23:39,758
...rushed to the battlement.

276
00:23:40,095 --> 00:23:41,858
Where I, Gandalf...

277
00:23:42,364 --> 00:23:45,663
...and the Gondor generals searched
the distance in vain...

278
00:23:46,135 --> 00:23:48,069
...for a sign of our rescuers.

279
00:23:48,671 --> 00:23:50,298
For we awaited Theoden...

280
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:53,967
...a valuable ally,
lord of the friendly nation of Rohan...

281
00:23:54,043 --> 00:23:58,537
...for whom we had dispatched
Pippin's Hobbit friend, little Merry...

282
00:23:59,648 --> 00:24:04,176
...to inform him of our perilous condition
and to beseech his aid.

283
00:24:04,253 --> 00:24:08,087
For we wondered, would he
and his armies come to our rescue?

284
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:12,987
Forward! To Minas-Tirith!

285
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,458
Forward!

286
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:21,602
For only Theoden could save our city...

287
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:24,566
...and make it safe
for the return of Aragorn.

288
00:24:25,107 --> 00:24:27,701
But we feared he would come too late.

289
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,413
- What? Denethor?
- He's gone loony, I tell you!

290
00:24:34,483 --> 00:24:35,711
Come quickly.

291
00:24:39,955 --> 00:24:41,422
You cannot do this!

292
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:44,682
Soon all shall be burned.

293
00:24:45,627 --> 00:24:47,390
The West has failed.

294
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:51,629
It shall go up in a great fire...

295
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,498
...and all shall be ended.

296
00:24:56,372 --> 00:25:00,468
Ash and smoke blown away on the wind.

297
00:25:01,176 --> 00:25:06,170
All shall not be ended.
Theoden's forces are on their way!

298
00:25:12,621 --> 00:25:15,749
Pride and despair!

299
00:25:16,592 --> 00:25:18,583
Pride and despair!

300
00:25:19,194 --> 00:25:22,425
Didst thou think the eyes
of the White Tower were blind?

301
00:25:26,635 --> 00:25:31,368
I have looked inside my palantir.

302
00:25:31,507 --> 00:25:35,500
- What is that?
- Palantir. The stuff of wizards.

303
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:37,902
A crystal ball to see the future.

304
00:25:38,614 --> 00:25:43,574
I have seen more than thou knowest,
gray fool.

305
00:25:44,219 --> 00:25:46,653
Thy hope is but ignorance.

306
00:25:47,856 --> 00:25:51,883
Even with the forces of Theoden,
there is no hope.

307
00:25:51,994 --> 00:25:54,462
Go forth and fight!

308
00:25:55,464 --> 00:25:56,658
Vanity!

309
00:25:57,366 --> 00:26:01,029
For a little space you may triumph
on the field...

310
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:02,764
...for a day.

311
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:08,600
But against the dark power...

312
00:26:08,677 --> 00:26:12,272
...that now rises, there is no victory.

313
00:26:12,848 --> 00:26:17,251
To this dying city,
only the first fingers of its hand...

314
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:19,116
...have yet been stretched.

315
00:26:20,022 --> 00:26:23,981
All the East is moving!

316
00:26:25,027 --> 00:26:29,726
And even now,
the wind of thy hope cheats thee...

317
00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:34,729
...and wafts up an enemy fleet
with black sails.

318
00:26:35,571 --> 00:26:40,508
Up the Great River, Anduin they come,
even now.

319
00:26:40,876 --> 00:26:43,709
The river which leads to the edge...

320
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:46,270
...of the Pelennor Fields.

321
00:26:52,154 --> 00:26:55,248
A black fleet? A devil's armada?

322
00:26:55,324 --> 00:26:59,158
- Do those palantir things ever lie?
- Never!

323
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,196
The West has failed!

324
00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:07,860
It is time for all to depart this life...

325
00:27:07,936 --> 00:27:10,530
...who would not be slaves!

326
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:15,032
Servants, come hither!

327
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:25,013
So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.

328
00:27:25,554 --> 00:27:28,455
And so pass also the days of Gondor.

329
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:32,024
For good or evil they have ended.

330
00:27:35,264 --> 00:27:37,198
You must take charge, Gandalf.

331
00:27:37,499 --> 00:27:39,194
You must lead our forces now...

332
00:27:39,268 --> 00:27:42,396
...until Aragorn returns
to claim the throne of Gondor.

333
00:27:42,471 --> 00:27:43,768
If he returns.

334
00:27:44,273 --> 00:27:45,262
Gandalf, you...

335
00:27:45,474 --> 00:27:49,342
I saw the vision in the palantir.
A dark fleet.

336
00:27:49,545 --> 00:27:51,843
- Is there no hope?
- None.

337
00:27:52,347 --> 00:27:54,281
Unless the Ring be destroyed.

338
00:27:55,117 --> 00:27:58,052
But alas, it is lost with its bearer, Frodo.

339
00:27:58,654 --> 00:27:59,780
All is gone.

340
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,988
I, Gandalf was without hope.

341
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,656
For I did not know
that at that very moment...

342
00:28:07,829 --> 00:28:10,024
...at that other towered fortress...

343
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,697
...the future of all good in the world...

344
00:28:12,768 --> 00:28:16,329
...rested upon the wits
and the tiny shoulders...

345
00:28:16,572 --> 00:28:18,699
...of poor little Samwise...

346
00:28:19,641 --> 00:28:21,802
...who, still undetected
by the Orcs within...

347
00:28:21,877 --> 00:28:25,472
...approached the gates
of the Tower of Cirith Ungol.

348
00:28:26,582 --> 00:28:28,675
But to get through those gates...

349
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:32,015
...he would have to pass
the Two Watchers.

350
00:28:36,391 --> 00:28:40,054
Though carved
from huge blocks of solid stone...

351
00:28:40,629 --> 00:28:44,087
...some dreadful spirit of evil vigilance
abode in them...

352
00:28:44,733 --> 00:28:46,724
...and they were aware.

353
00:28:54,142 --> 00:28:56,702
My imagination's running away with me.

354
00:28:57,846 --> 00:29:01,111
They're made of stone.
What harm can they do?

355
00:29:05,921 --> 00:29:08,082
Don't get too cocky, Samwise.

356
00:29:08,824 --> 00:29:13,261
Orcs aren't made of stone,
and they have ears.

357
00:29:15,163 --> 00:29:17,256
Though where the blazes are they?

358
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,495
I thought the tower was full of them.

359
00:29:23,505 --> 00:29:25,530
But they give me the shivers.

360
00:29:27,175 --> 00:29:30,941
Forget about them.
Get past as quick as I can!

361
00:29:38,086 --> 00:29:40,054
Bless my soul.

362
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:44,657
Like some invisible gate.

363
00:29:46,461 --> 00:29:48,986
That's how the Watchers keep guard.

364
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:52,259
Blast!

365
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:57,368
How do I get through, or climb over,
or under something I can't see?

366
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:00,099
How?

367
00:30:00,175 --> 00:30:01,267
Ouch!

368
00:30:02,611 --> 00:30:04,272
Something's burning me.

369
00:30:05,714 --> 00:30:09,616
What's this? A phial?

370
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:15,552
And what magic is in it
to make it glow so?

371
00:30:23,098 --> 00:30:24,827
They're opening up!

372
00:30:28,737 --> 00:30:30,227
Thank you, old boys.

373
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,439
It was bad manners you showed me before.

374
00:30:36,378 --> 00:30:37,902
Handy, this thing.

375
00:30:48,423 --> 00:30:50,823
An alarm! That's done it.

376
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:06,239
I'm ready for you.

377
00:31:07,476 --> 00:31:11,344
Tell your captains
that a great Elf warrior has called...

378
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:13,142
...with his Elf blade!

379
00:31:22,057 --> 00:31:23,957
They're all dead.

380
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:26,416
Why?

381
00:31:26,995 --> 00:31:30,294
The tower was crawling
with them just a few hours ago.

382
00:31:32,968 --> 00:31:35,402
Looks like they were
fighting among themselves.

383
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,937
But what for?

384
00:31:38,807 --> 00:31:42,140
There's a lot less of you left
to attack Minas-Tirith!

385
00:31:43,078 --> 00:31:45,103
Goodbye and good riddance!

386
00:31:50,552 --> 00:31:53,646
The whole tower climbs backwards-like.

387
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,719
I'll follow these lights.

388
00:32:01,863 --> 00:32:06,095
This must be the entrance to the top tier.

389
00:32:07,235 --> 00:32:09,533
Frodo can't be far away.

390
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,008
An Orc! They're not all dead!

391
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:25,551
Kill him! Bone him! Boil him!

392
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:28,353
There's a sweet one for you!

393
00:32:29,224 --> 00:32:31,089
Split him in two!

394
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,694
Can't let him have the Ring!

395
00:32:47,909 --> 00:32:48,898
No!

396
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:57,478
What the blazes made him do that?

397
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,412
Come back here!

398
00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:03,189
No!

399
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,694
The great Elf warrior is loose! Stop.

400
00:33:09,231 --> 00:33:11,665
Stop, or I'll skin you alive!

401
00:33:14,569 --> 00:33:16,833
Mercy!

402
00:33:16,938 --> 00:33:20,237
I'll think about it!
I have some questions, filthy one.

403
00:33:20,308 --> 00:33:22,742
Yes? I'll tell you anything.

404
00:33:22,844 --> 00:33:25,244
The Hobbit, Frodo, is he still alive?

405
00:33:25,647 --> 00:33:28,980
If anything still lives here, he does.

406
00:33:29,217 --> 00:33:32,084
What happened here?
Why all this carnage?

407
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,984
Our captains made battle
and ordered us to fight also.

408
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:38,685
What was in contest?

409
00:33:39,027 --> 00:33:41,359
The Hobbit's pretty coat...

410
00:33:41,596 --> 00:33:44,929
...when he reveals its hiding place.

411
00:33:45,534 --> 00:33:49,026
You killed each other
for that blasted cloak?

412
00:33:49,804 --> 00:33:52,204
Well, I have it! Not Frodo.

413
00:33:53,174 --> 00:33:54,163
You?

414
00:33:54,843 --> 00:33:57,073
You're just a Hobbit.

415
00:33:57,512 --> 00:33:59,707
- Give me the coat.
- Get back!

416
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,990
This must be the top.

417
00:34:18,033 --> 00:34:19,557
Anything above?

418
00:34:21,636 --> 00:34:22,625
Yes.

419
00:34:23,171 --> 00:34:25,002
There is something!

420
00:34:29,744 --> 00:34:31,211
Frodo!

421
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,350
Stop that, you pig!

422
00:34:59,908 --> 00:35:01,068
Frodo.

423
00:35:01,943 --> 00:35:04,571
Dear master. Frodo.

424
00:35:06,448 --> 00:35:07,437
You live.

425
00:35:08,249 --> 00:35:10,240
You live!

426
00:35:11,186 --> 00:35:14,815
- Am I still dreaming?
- No dream, master.

427
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:18,184
It's real. I've come.

428
00:35:19,094 --> 00:35:22,188
Sam. Dear Sam.

429
00:35:23,798 --> 00:35:27,029
I feel like a child at rest.

430
00:35:27,769 --> 00:35:29,828
When night fears are driven away.

431
00:35:30,605 --> 00:35:34,234
By some loved voice.

432
00:35:35,844 --> 00:35:37,505
Come, Mr. Frodo.

433
00:35:38,213 --> 00:35:40,909
I still must get you out of this place.

434
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:44,950
Please, dear master, wake up.

435
00:35:46,554 --> 00:35:48,078
They hovered over me.

436
00:35:48,657 --> 00:35:51,888
Gloating, fingering their knives.

437
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,756
The whips, their claws, their eyes...

438
00:35:54,829 --> 00:35:56,922
Don't think about it.

439
00:35:57,465 --> 00:35:59,456
Let me help you to your feet.

440
00:36:00,669 --> 00:36:03,297
Oh, dear. The quest.

441
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:05,464
The quest has failed.

442
00:36:05,907 --> 00:36:08,375
Failed? No, sir.

443
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:12,104
Yes. The Ring is gone, dear Sam.

444
00:36:13,982 --> 00:36:16,849
Even if we could get out of here,
we can't escape.

445
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:20,180
For evil is everywhere.

446
00:36:20,922 --> 00:36:23,550
And only Elves can escape Middle-earth.

447
00:36:24,325 --> 00:36:26,919
They board the white ships
at the Gray Havens...

448
00:36:26,995 --> 00:36:30,453
...and sail off to the lands beyond.

449
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:00,650
Don't even think of passing on!

450
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:03,329
The quest has not failed, master!

451
00:37:03,698 --> 00:37:07,862
You don't understand.
The Orcs took everything!

452
00:37:08,236 --> 00:37:11,103
Not everything. Look.

453
00:37:12,807 --> 00:37:15,799
You've got it? You've got it here?

454
00:37:15,877 --> 00:37:18,971
You must have lost it in the struggle.
I found it.

455
00:37:19,547 --> 00:37:21,879
Samwise, you are a marvel!

456
00:37:22,317 --> 00:37:23,978
I'll keep it 'round my neck...

457
00:37:24,052 --> 00:37:26,987
...for it's too heavy
for you to bear in your condition.

458
00:37:30,925 --> 00:37:34,554
Give it to me at once! You can't have it!

459
00:37:34,629 --> 00:37:38,190
All right, Mr. Frodo. Here it is.

460
00:37:40,368 --> 00:37:45,362
"Beware the power
is a power never known

461
00:37:45,807 --> 00:37:50,744
"Beware the power that was simple
now has grown

462
00:37:51,412 --> 00:37:53,676
"Beware"

463
00:38:01,689 --> 00:38:04,419
You filthy, slimy thief!

464
00:38:05,026 --> 00:38:08,189
- I have the power now.
- Master, no.

465
00:38:08,496 --> 00:38:10,964
Don't say such things. Please don't.

466
00:38:11,432 --> 00:38:13,457
It's the Ring.

467
00:38:15,703 --> 00:38:20,402
Sam. What have I said?
What have I done? Forgive me.

468
00:38:21,176 --> 00:38:24,270
I'd forgotten its malevolent trickery.

469
00:38:24,979 --> 00:38:27,675
I'm fine now. Fine. Sam, forgive me.

470
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,780
I must carry the burden to the end.

471
00:38:30,852 --> 00:38:33,320
It can't be altered.
You can't come between...

472
00:38:33,388 --> 00:38:35,322
...me and this doom.

473
00:38:35,924 --> 00:38:39,883
As you wish, master.
I also have found Sting.

474
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:43,429
Might I keep it with me a little longer?

475
00:38:43,865 --> 00:38:47,665
I have the strength to use it.
And you, with your wound and all...

476
00:38:48,236 --> 00:38:50,932
Yes, of course, dear Sam.

477
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,671
And your cloak which I wear.

478
00:38:54,442 --> 00:38:56,535
In a pocket I found this.

479
00:38:57,545 --> 00:39:01,242
It has powers.
It got me past the Watchers. What is it?

480
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:04,882
The Phial of Galadriel! I can say no more.

481
00:39:05,353 --> 00:39:09,449
If I betray the trust and give the secret,
its powers will die.

482
00:39:09,958 --> 00:39:14,418
- I understand.
- But now we must get out of here quickly.

483
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,966
I know the chain mail's heavy for you.
But we may need it.

484
00:39:23,037 --> 00:39:27,565
And I can't leave anything behind,
so I'll wear the Orc garb over my own.

485
00:39:29,611 --> 00:39:34,548
Don't we make a fine, matching pair.
Now, off to Mount Doom.

486
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:38,245
Hope you've made inquiries
about inns along the road?

487
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,582
- Inns, master?
- For food and drink.

488
00:39:42,056 --> 00:39:44,388
Only the best for two fine Orcs.

489
00:39:44,792 --> 00:39:47,920
There's nothing, master,
and you know it well.

490
00:39:48,663 --> 00:39:52,531
Save for the few crumbs of cake
and drops of water left in my pack.

491
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,229
Courage, Sam. That's enough to start on.

492
00:39:56,504 --> 00:40:00,372
The food we might manage,
but the water's going to be bad business.

493
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:02,137
We'll make it.

494
00:40:02,343 --> 00:40:05,870
But we'd best start,
or a whole lake of it won't do us any good!

495
00:40:09,517 --> 00:40:12,008
No, I'm all right. It's the mail.

496
00:40:12,086 --> 00:40:14,418
I'll get used to it. Come.

497
00:40:22,997 --> 00:40:27,331
I'm going to faint, Sam.
I don't know what's come over me.

498
00:40:27,902 --> 00:40:31,668
It's that invisible gate.
There's some devilry there.

499
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,932
But I got through once.

500
00:40:35,643 --> 00:40:36,974
Now for it!

501
00:40:44,352 --> 00:40:46,217
It's still there!

502
00:40:46,788 --> 00:40:48,278
This is not working.

503
00:40:48,356 --> 00:40:51,985
They were expecting it!
Their will is strong.

504
00:40:52,527 --> 00:40:54,427
It needs helping.

505
00:41:00,668 --> 00:41:03,193
We've broken the Watchers' will!

506
00:41:30,298 --> 00:41:32,698
We've still a chance, Samwise.

507
00:41:32,834 --> 00:41:36,292
There's still a chance to destroy the Ring.

508
00:41:54,856 --> 00:41:59,725
- A Black Rider. The Nazgul.
- Run, Mr. Frodo.

509
00:41:59,994 --> 00:42:02,485
Not that way! There's a drop, follow me.

510
00:42:20,748 --> 00:42:22,375
Careful, Mr. Frodo.

511
00:42:23,017 --> 00:42:27,317
I can't. Not another step.

512
00:42:27,655 --> 00:42:29,748
We must keep going, master.

513
00:42:30,124 --> 00:42:32,456
The Nazgul is in charge of the Tower now!

514
00:42:32,527 --> 00:42:35,291
A Black Rider is not
so easy to fool as the Orcs.

515
00:42:35,596 --> 00:42:38,258
Just give me a moment.

516
00:42:38,633 --> 00:42:41,568
Begging your pardon, sir,
but there's no time.

517
00:42:42,203 --> 00:42:44,865
Listen as the foul flying demon...

518
00:42:44,939 --> 00:42:47,271
...gives alarm
to the whole Vale of Gorgoroth!

519
00:42:48,042 --> 00:42:51,136
He's rallying the dark forces
to defend the Tower.

520
00:42:51,212 --> 00:42:54,477
Soon they'll be upon us.
We've got to get away and hide!

521
00:42:55,049 --> 00:42:57,517
Yes, of course, dear Sam.

522
00:43:02,924 --> 00:43:03,913
Listen.

523
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:10,558
We'd best get across the bridge,
while we've still time.

524
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:21,107
If Sauron himself was to offer me
a glass of water, I'd shake his hand.

525
00:43:21,876 --> 00:43:25,676
Don't say such things.
It only makes it worse.

526
00:43:27,982 --> 00:43:28,971
Sam.

527
00:43:30,551 --> 00:43:34,112
A spot of dizziness there. I'm sorry.

528
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:40,156
'Tis a long time, Mr. Frodo,
since I had a proper sleep.

529
00:43:40,761 --> 00:43:43,662
Come, Sam, we shall support each other.

530
00:43:48,136 --> 00:43:50,161
It's no good, Sam.

531
00:43:51,339 --> 00:43:54,274
I can't manage
the weight of this mail shirt.

532
00:43:54,342 --> 00:43:58,608
It's of no use anyway.
We shall never get through by fighting.

533
00:43:59,213 --> 00:44:01,147
We may have some to do.

534
00:44:02,416 --> 00:44:04,884
We won't take on armies.

535
00:44:05,319 --> 00:44:08,152
Who knows
what's down here in this canyon...

536
00:44:08,589 --> 00:44:10,079
...slithering behind the rocks?

537
00:44:11,192 --> 00:44:13,353
No, Sam, it must go.

538
00:44:14,028 --> 00:44:17,225
What about that Gollum creature,
for instance?

539
00:44:18,166 --> 00:44:22,102
The Gollum isn't dead,
and he's still after that ring!

540
00:44:23,371 --> 00:44:26,499
I'd hate to think of you
with naught but a bit of leather...

541
00:44:26,574 --> 00:44:29,065
...between you and a stab in the dark.

542
00:44:33,614 --> 00:44:35,172
This hellish Mordor.

543
00:44:35,249 --> 00:44:38,218
First it sears you, then it freezes you.

544
00:44:39,053 --> 00:44:40,418
Mr. Frodo...

545
00:44:40,488 --> 00:44:44,015
...maybe we could rest just a little.

546
00:44:44,792 --> 00:44:48,888
My eyes are fair closing by themselves.

547
00:44:48,963 --> 00:44:50,089
Not here.

548
00:44:50,298 --> 00:44:51,788
I didn't want to say anything...

549
00:44:51,866 --> 00:44:56,098
...but there's a black rider,
a Nazgul, over us.

550
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:59,230
I can feel it. We must keep moving.

551
00:45:17,558 --> 00:45:22,552
Only a little more
to climb out of the canyon.

552
00:45:24,298 --> 00:45:26,061
Then we'll take a look...

553
00:45:26,534 --> 00:45:30,698
...and see what the Vale of Gorgoroth
holds for us.

554
00:45:34,275 --> 00:45:37,335
I told you, you'd see it, Mr. Frodo.

555
00:45:38,646 --> 00:45:40,546
Just look at it.

556
00:45:44,185 --> 00:45:46,415
God help us.

557
00:45:48,723 --> 00:45:52,159
Behold Gorgoroth!

558
00:45:54,829 --> 00:45:57,229
I don't like the looks of things at all.

559
00:45:57,498 --> 00:45:59,261
Pretty hopeless, I call it.

560
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:03,736
Yes. And these dark armies
are not only of Orcs.

561
00:46:04,105 --> 00:46:05,766
There are Men, too!

562
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:11,002
We just can't cross all that open country
crawling with enemies.

563
00:46:11,279 --> 00:46:14,578
Still, Sam, we shall have to try.

564
00:46:50,184 --> 00:46:52,243
It's no worse than I expected.

565
00:46:52,753 --> 00:46:54,721
I never hoped to get across...

566
00:46:54,789 --> 00:46:57,758
...but I've got to do the best I can.

567
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:05,997
I think we can make it
to the next boulder, master.

568
00:47:06,067 --> 00:47:07,432
No one is about.

569
00:47:08,102 --> 00:47:09,763
Blasted moonlight.

570
00:47:09,904 --> 00:47:13,840
Traveling by night's
almost as bad as by day.

571
00:47:14,308 --> 00:47:16,538
Come now, sir. I'll help.

572
00:47:21,115 --> 00:47:23,015
Got to rest.

573
00:47:24,352 --> 00:47:27,480
If you please, sir. Me too.

574
00:47:29,623 --> 00:47:31,386
Just for a few minutes.

575
00:47:44,739 --> 00:47:46,229
"Where there's a whip

576
00:47:46,707 --> 00:47:48,174

Mr. Frodo.

607
00:49:21,702 --> 00:49:24,865
- What is it?
- Now we've gone and done it.

608
00:49:24,939 --> 00:49:26,804
Slept through till daylight.

609
00:49:27,308 --> 00:49:31,039
With only this fool rock between us
and them armies.

610
00:49:31,579 --> 00:49:32,603
Look out.

611
00:49:34,081 --> 00:49:37,448
What have we here? Two deserters?

612
00:49:37,852 --> 00:49:40,013
Up with you! Get in line!

613
00:49:40,287 --> 00:49:41,481
We're in luck.

614
00:49:41,555 --> 00:49:43,580
- He thinks we're Orcs.
- Luck?

615
00:49:44,625 --> 00:49:49,028
Good sir, we're gonna be marching
with the whole blinking army...

616
00:49:49,096 --> 00:49:51,724
...back to Cirith Ungol
where we started from!

617
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,629
Come on, you slugs!

618
00:49:57,938 --> 00:49:59,269
"Where's there's a whip

619
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:01,900

"Where there's a whip, there's a way"

623
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,520
I can't continue.

624
00:50:23,063 --> 00:50:26,362
I'd rather be singing
a good old Hobbit song myself.

625
00:50:36,777 --> 00:50:39,837
At least they gave us
provisions for our packs.

626
00:50:40,214 --> 00:50:43,274
But Orc food is enough
to turn a rodent sick.

627
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:46,114
Samwise, we have got to break ranks.

628
00:50:46,186 --> 00:50:48,313
Not while old whipper there is watching.

629
00:50:48,556 --> 00:50:51,753
Don't worry, master.
The opportunity will come.

630
00:50:55,729 --> 00:50:56,718
Halt.

631
00:50:57,331 --> 00:50:59,196
What do you mean, "halt"?

632
00:50:59,533 --> 00:51:02,991
I have a battalion of Men
to move across your road.

633
00:51:03,437 --> 00:51:07,396
Well I've got a battalion of Orcs
to move across yours.

634
00:51:07,474 --> 00:51:08,498
You wait!

635
00:51:08,809 --> 00:51:11,676
Men come before Orcs. Get back.

636
00:51:11,912 --> 00:51:15,177
I think this is it! You stay right here, sir.

637
00:51:17,351 --> 00:51:19,285
You going to stand for that, sir?

638
00:51:20,287 --> 00:51:21,845
Get back in line!

639
00:51:21,922 --> 00:51:26,859
You mean you're going to let a pack
of filthy Man-creatures go before us?

640
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:32,188
And you call yourself an Orc?

641
00:51:34,234 --> 00:51:35,462
You're right.

642
00:51:38,038 --> 00:51:43,032
Kill them, bone them, cut them to bits!

643
00:51:44,445 --> 00:51:46,606
Smash them, bash them!

644
00:51:47,681 --> 00:51:49,046
Skin them alive!

645
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,405
Not an inch.

646
00:52:14,808 --> 00:52:17,504
Not an inch further can I move.

647
00:52:18,178 --> 00:52:20,078
Come, Mr. Frodo.

648
00:52:20,981 --> 00:52:25,975
One more crawl and then you can lie still.

649
00:52:27,921 --> 00:52:29,650
A bit further.

650
00:52:30,824 --> 00:52:32,621
This way, sir.

651
00:52:34,528 --> 00:52:38,430
No use. Going to die. Can't see a thing.

652
00:52:40,067 --> 00:52:41,398
Mr. Frodo.

653
00:52:49,276 --> 00:52:50,903
Don't die, Mr. Frodo.

654
00:52:51,512 --> 00:52:54,743
You can't die. Please, master.

655
00:52:56,450 --> 00:53:00,648
If any power of good can hear us
in this accursed land...

656
00:53:00,854 --> 00:53:02,515
...give us help.

657
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:04,514
Help us.

658
00:53:14,601 --> 00:53:15,829
Power of good?

659
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:20,672
Indeed, was there none left
in all Middle-earth...

660
00:53:20,741 --> 00:53:23,869
...with strength to aid our dying cause?

661
00:53:25,946 --> 00:53:30,645
At that moment, the forces of darkness
made ready to break the main gate...

662
00:53:30,818 --> 00:53:34,413
...with a mighty battering ram
which they had named Grond.

663
00:53:38,926 --> 00:53:42,362
Long had it been forging
in the dark smithies of Mordor...

664
00:53:43,097 --> 00:53:45,122
...and on it spells of ruin lay.

665
00:53:55,242 --> 00:54:00,202
- The gate will never stand up to that thing!
- Like the arm of the devil himself!

666
00:54:01,582 --> 00:54:04,415
When the gates break
I shall be there to greet it!

667
00:54:04,885 --> 00:54:07,479
Have my steed, Shadowfax, made ready!

668
00:54:07,821 --> 00:54:10,483
- Farewell, Pippin.
- I go with you, sir.

669
00:54:10,691 --> 00:54:14,525
Then we leave this life together.
Come, little one.

670
00:54:26,974 --> 00:54:28,532
On, Shadowfax!

671
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:48,789
The Lord of the Nazgul...

672
00:54:49,029 --> 00:54:51,224
...Sauron's second-in-command.

673
00:54:51,565 --> 00:54:53,726
A creature of the super-natural...

674
00:54:54,268 --> 00:54:57,362
...and so no living Man could hinder him...

675
00:54:57,871 --> 00:55:00,066
...nor bring him harm in any way.

676
00:55:00,641 --> 00:55:03,109
He was invulnerable!

677
00:55:57,731 --> 00:55:59,596
You cannot enter here!

678
00:56:00,467 --> 00:56:03,129
Go back to the abyss prepared for you!

679
00:56:03,437 --> 00:56:08,431
Go back! Fall to the nothingness
that awaits you and your master. Go!

680
00:56:16,416 --> 00:56:18,611
Old fool!

681
00:56:19,019 --> 00:56:21,886
This is my hour.

682
00:56:22,489 --> 00:56:26,152
Do you not know Death when you see it?

683
00:56:26,627 --> 00:56:30,757
Die now and curse in vain!

684
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:44,434
And, as from some courtyard of the city,
a cock crowed...

685
00:56:44,845 --> 00:56:46,938
...recking nothing of wizardry or war...

686
00:56:47,547 --> 00:56:49,515
...welcoming only the morning...

687
00:56:49,583 --> 00:56:52,518
...that in the sky far above
the shadows of death...

688
00:56:52,653 --> 00:56:54,484
...was coming with the dawn.

689
00:56:55,489 --> 00:56:59,357
For as if in answer there came
from far away, another note.

690
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:05,189
Horns! Horns! Horns!

691
00:57:05,265 --> 00:57:08,496
Over the fields of Pelennor,
they echoed from the distance.

692
00:57:08,769 --> 00:57:11,704
Great horns in the north, wildly blowing.

693
00:57:12,172 --> 00:57:16,609
Theoden and the rescuing arms of Rohan
had come at last.

694
00:57:29,089 --> 00:57:32,081
Ride now.

695
00:57:32,359 --> 00:57:34,088
Ride now, to Gondor.

696
00:57:36,863 --> 00:57:39,525
Victory was slipping
from the grasp of evil...

697
00:57:39,967 --> 00:57:42,765
...even as he stretched
out his hand to seize it.

698
00:57:43,003 --> 00:57:46,234
And the strength of goodness
began to be felt once more...

699
00:57:46,707 --> 00:57:48,766
...throughout the lands.

700
00:57:51,411 --> 00:57:53,504
Had a prayer been answered?

701
00:57:54,414 --> 00:57:56,405
Water. Give me water.

702
00:57:57,117 --> 00:57:59,210
Master! Thank heaven!

703
00:57:59,486 --> 00:58:01,647
Here, not too much now.

704
00:58:02,556 --> 00:58:04,387
Not all at once.

705
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,557
He's weakening.

706
00:58:09,129 --> 00:58:12,394
I feel it. Sauron is weakening.

707
00:58:13,266 --> 00:58:15,097
But he is still in command.

708
00:58:15,736 --> 00:58:19,137
His arm is long, and it wields great power.

709
00:58:19,639 --> 00:58:22,665
No, master. You must rest.

710
00:58:22,976 --> 00:58:25,206
I must still destroy the Ring.

711
00:58:25,645 --> 00:58:27,875
I've more of a chance now...

712
00:58:28,315 --> 00:58:31,443
...but there's still such a long way to go.

713
00:58:31,618 --> 00:58:36,055
That's tomorrow, Mr. Frodo, tomorrow.

714
01:00:29,503 --> 01:00:32,700
And as the battle raged anew
on the fields of Pelennor...

715
01:00:32,939 --> 01:00:36,500
...the carnage continuing endlessly
through the days and nights...

716
01:00:36,877 --> 01:00:41,541
...the real victory still lay
in the hands of Frodo and Samwise...

717
01:00:41,748 --> 01:00:44,740
...and the terrible weight
they bore closer and closer...

718
01:00:44,818 --> 01:00:47,446
...to the destruction,
which was our only hope.

719
01:00:51,558 --> 01:00:53,822
And finally, almost dead...

720
01:00:54,361 --> 01:00:57,455
...without fully realizing
they had reached the roots...

721
01:00:57,697 --> 01:01:01,155
...of the accursed Mount Doom.

722
01:01:02,369 --> 01:01:04,894
Come, Sam. Dear Sam.

723
01:01:05,405 --> 01:01:09,000
For the rest of the way we shall crawl.

724
01:01:10,143 --> 01:01:12,338
And so foot by foot...

725
01:01:12,646 --> 01:01:15,114
...like small gray insects...

726
01:01:15,182 --> 01:01:16,615
...they crept up the slope...

727
01:01:16,683 --> 01:01:19,743
...ever closer to that which lay
inside the mountain...

728
01:01:20,854 --> 01:01:23,914
...the fire, and the Cracks of Doom.

729
01:01:31,164 --> 01:01:33,462
"Doom

730
01:01:34,201 --> 01:01:38,262
"The Cracks of Doom

731
01:01:38,505 --> 01:01:42,498
"The chambers of fire

732
01:01:42,709 --> 01:01:47,703
"The fires of doom"

733
01:01:52,752 --> 01:01:55,550
Who causes the minutes to fall dead...

734
01:01:56,122 --> 01:01:58,590
...adding up to no passing hour...

735
01:01:59,192 --> 01:02:01,558
...bringing no change from day to night...

736
01:02:01,895 --> 01:02:06,696
...as the unseen sun fails to filter
into the ever-present shadows?

737
01:02:07,267 --> 01:02:12,136
Who is this dark lord who turns
starless nights into sunless days?

738
01:02:12,772 --> 01:02:16,299
How does his piercing eye
see through the ever-present darkness?

739
01:02:16,876 --> 01:02:18,969
Seeing all and nothing.

740
01:02:20,213 --> 01:02:23,649
The Restless Eye, in his dark tower...

741
01:02:23,883 --> 01:02:28,343
...wearing a veil of protective shadow
he has woven from fear.

742
01:02:29,322 --> 01:02:31,847
And yet he fears, too.

743
01:02:32,259 --> 01:02:34,887
In the security of his protective realm...

744
01:02:35,161 --> 01:02:38,688
...he fears the winds of the world
are turning against him.

745
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:42,100
Tearing aside his veils and troubling him...

746
01:02:42,435 --> 01:02:47,429
...with tidings of bold spies
that have passed through his fences.

747
01:02:52,946 --> 01:02:55,244
"Doom

748
01:02:55,982 --> 01:03:00,146

"The fires of doom"

751
01:03:17,604 --> 01:03:21,700
- Did you see when the clouds parted?
- Yes.

752
01:03:21,775 --> 01:03:23,208
He's spotted us!

753
01:03:23,543 --> 01:03:26,535
It's all up, or will soon be.

754
01:03:26,713 --> 01:03:28,578
This is the end of ends!

755
01:03:29,582 --> 01:03:32,050
Still have a chance.

756
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,247
Bless you, sir, for your bravery!

757
01:03:37,123 --> 01:03:38,920
Give me the strength.

758
01:03:39,659 --> 01:03:44,358
I ask you:
Give me the strength to try once more.

759
01:04:00,847 --> 01:04:04,408
Wicked master.

760
01:04:05,218 --> 01:04:08,244
- God help us.
- Gollum.

761
01:04:08,621 --> 01:04:10,748
Wicked master cheats us.

762
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:15,428
He mustn't go that way!

763
01:04:16,129 --> 01:04:19,223
He mustn't hurt Precious.

764
01:04:19,532 --> 01:04:21,693
Away, you scum.

765
01:04:21,801 --> 01:04:23,359
What do you want of us?

766
01:04:23,436 --> 01:04:26,701
Give it to Gollum, yes, give it to us!

767
01:04:28,842 --> 01:04:30,867
Give it to us!

768
01:04:45,558 --> 01:04:48,618
My Precious, my ring.

769
01:04:48,695 --> 01:04:51,755
Soon it will be mine...

770
01:04:52,031 --> 01:04:55,194
...all mine!

771
01:04:55,602 --> 01:04:59,333
Precious, my Precious.

772
01:05:00,106 --> 01:05:01,266
Precious.

773
01:05:34,674 --> 01:05:37,609
Precious is mine.

774
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:49,711
You foul, reeking scum!

775
01:05:49,956 --> 01:05:51,446
I'll kill you!

776
01:05:54,794 --> 01:05:57,922
I can't strike! I may hit Mr. Frodo.

777
01:05:57,997 --> 01:06:01,125
Let me get hold of the Ring.

778
01:06:12,612 --> 01:06:15,445
"The bearer of the Ring

779
01:06:15,515 --> 01:06:17,710
"The wearer of the Ring

01:06:17,917 --> 01:06:22,911
"Stands on the very brink of fate

Be gone and trouble me no more!

784
01:06:38,872 --> 01:06:40,806
If you touch me ever again...

785
01:06:40,874 --> 01:06:44,935
...you shall be cast, yourself,
into the Fire of Doom.

786
01:06:50,450 --> 01:06:52,418
Look out! He'll spring again.

787
01:06:52,485 --> 01:06:56,785
Quick, master, no time to lose.
Go on! I'll deal with him!

788
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:05,928
Now I can deal with you!

789
01:07:06,933 --> 01:07:10,494
Don't kill us. Don't hurt us.

790
01:07:11,738 --> 01:07:14,138
Let us live, please.

791
01:07:14,207 --> 01:07:19,110
Let us live, just a little longer.

792
01:07:20,847 --> 01:07:22,144
Live.

793
01:07:34,694 --> 01:07:36,025
Lost.

794
01:07:40,199 --> 01:07:41,826
We're lost!

795
01:07:42,502 --> 01:07:45,869
And when Precious goes...

796
01:07:45,939 --> 01:07:49,466
...we'll die, yes.

797
01:07:49,742 --> 01:07:54,577
All of us die into the dust.

798
01:08:02,589 --> 01:08:07,026
How can I kill such a pitiful
and cringing abomination?

799
01:08:07,427 --> 01:08:11,921
I have come to know the strain of bearing
the Ring for even a little while.

800
01:08:12,231 --> 01:08:17,225
But this miserable creature
enslaved to it for years...

801
01:08:17,937 --> 01:08:20,531
Curse you, you stinking thing!

802
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:24,305
Be off! I don't trust you,
not as far as I could kick you.

803
01:08:24,644 --> 01:08:29,638
But be off or I shall hurt you
with nasty cruel steel. Yes!

804
01:08:44,530 --> 01:08:48,364
Now to find Mr. Frodo again.

805
01:08:53,506 --> 01:08:57,135
And here it is. Sammath Naur!

806
01:08:58,011 --> 01:09:02,948
Doorway to the gut of the mountain,
and to hell itself, for all I know.

807
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:11,554
Dark, hot, reeking.

808
01:09:13,626 --> 01:09:18,256
Frodo! Master!

809
01:09:21,334 --> 01:09:23,325
There's no choice.

810
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:25,662
I have to go in.

811
01:09:40,186 --> 01:09:44,213
And at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields
the tide had turned...

812
01:09:44,357 --> 01:09:48,088
...with the arrival of Theoden
and the armies of Rohan.

813
01:10:05,211 --> 01:10:08,237
- Hail proud Merry!
- Hail Pippin.

814
01:10:08,981 --> 01:10:12,610
Bless you for a sure eye, old friend.
How good to see you!

815
01:10:12,685 --> 01:10:15,119
Bless you for bringing Theoden
and his army.

816
01:10:15,188 --> 01:10:16,780
You've won the day for us!

817
01:10:32,739 --> 01:10:37,073
In the midst of Theoden's glory,
his golden shield was dimmed.

818
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:42,374
The new morning was blotted
from the sky. And the dark fell upon him.

819
01:10:48,254 --> 01:10:50,449
Fear no darkness, Snowmane.

820
01:10:52,558 --> 01:10:54,788
No, Snowmane!

821
01:11:00,833 --> 01:11:05,429
And the Dark Force had claimed
our savior, Lord of Rohan.

822
01:11:06,339 --> 01:11:09,308
Lord Theoden! Nay.

823
01:11:09,876 --> 01:11:13,937
Oh, my dear master. Oh, the horror.

824
01:11:14,514 --> 01:11:17,449
No, my friend. He is gone!

825
01:11:18,117 --> 01:11:19,675
You can do nothing.

826
01:11:21,154 --> 01:11:23,622
Hear me, O Darkness!

827
01:11:24,056 --> 01:11:26,889
I will avenge my lord!

828
01:11:36,169 --> 01:11:37,193
And what event...

829
01:11:37,804 --> 01:11:42,138
...at just that moment
caused evil to enlist such power?

830
01:11:42,875 --> 01:11:44,638
Nothing here, surely.

831
01:11:46,779 --> 01:11:49,111
But in the bowels of Mount Doom...

832
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:55,814
Master! Mr. Frodo.

833
01:11:57,757 --> 01:12:00,692
Master, where are you?

834
01:12:03,362 --> 01:12:06,559
Behold! The Crack of Doom!

835
01:12:06,666 --> 01:12:08,861
- Master.
- Hold. Get back!

836
01:12:09,235 --> 01:12:11,635
Master, it is me, Samwise!

837
01:12:12,471 --> 01:12:14,666
And if that be the Crack of Doom...

838
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:19,575
...at last do what you've come
all this distance to do!

839
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:20,668
Now!

840
01:12:20,947 --> 01:12:25,475
I have come. But I do not choose
to do now what I have come to do!

841
01:12:27,153 --> 01:12:31,886
"The bearer of the Ring
The wearer of the Ring

The Ring is mine. Look!

852
01:13:32,652 --> 01:13:34,176

853
01:13:34,487 --> 01:13:35,613
No!

Please!

855
01:13:53,205 --> 01:13:56,402
He had come again, bringing ruin...

856
01:13:56,475 --> 01:14:00,104
...turning hope to despair,
and victory to death.

857
01:14:04,083 --> 01:14:07,484
Be gone, foul Dwimmerlaik,
Lord of Carrion.

858
01:14:07,553 --> 01:14:08,781
Leave the dead in peace!

859
01:14:09,288 --> 01:14:13,884
Come not between the Nazgul
and his prey!

860
01:14:14,093 --> 01:14:17,620
Or he will slay thee in turn.

861
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:20,697
Do what you will. I will hinder it, if I may!

862
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:25,169
Hinder me? Thou fool.

863
01:14:25,504 --> 01:14:28,439
Dost thou not know the prophecy?

864
01:14:28,541 --> 01:14:33,001
"No living man may hinder me."

865
01:14:33,145 --> 01:14:35,545
But no living man am I!

866
01:14:35,614 --> 01:14:38,208
You look upon a woman. Eowyn am I.

867
01:14:38,351 --> 01:14:41,115
You stand between me
and my lord and kin.

Be gone for living or dark undead
I will smite you if you touch him!

869
01:14:47,093 --> 01:14:49,823
A woman? Eowyn?

870
01:14:51,597 --> 01:14:53,622
'Tis Lord Theoden's niece!

871
01:14:54,166 --> 01:14:56,999
She wanted to ride with us, but he forbade.

872
01:14:57,703 --> 01:15:00,501
She disguised as a knight
and she came hither!

873
01:15:05,778 --> 01:15:08,338
A foul, putrid wind!

874
01:15:08,647 --> 01:15:10,877
How does she bear the stench of it?

875
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:13,214
Strong she is, and brave.

876
01:15:13,519 --> 01:15:15,350
I must to her aid!

877
01:15:45,785 --> 01:15:46,479
No!

878
01:15:59,832 --> 01:16:00,821
It's empty!

879
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:04,358
Uncle, I have avenged thee!

880
01:16:07,173 --> 01:16:10,165
Theoden was borne
from the field with honor.

881
01:16:10,509 --> 01:16:15,173
And we wondered if, when our own lord,
King Aragorn, returned...

882
01:16:15,247 --> 01:16:17,511
...would his fate be the same?

883
01:16:21,587 --> 01:16:25,990
With the death of the Nazgul lord,
Sauron's forces lost heart...

884
01:16:26,325 --> 01:16:29,055
...and began a retreat of abysmal disarray.

885
01:16:31,664 --> 01:16:35,031
And then, as if our triumph
were but a child's toy...

886
01:16:35,468 --> 01:16:39,097
...a game with which Sauron
was playing and taunting us...

887
01:16:39,271 --> 01:16:41,637
...the tide of battle suddenly changed.

888
01:16:42,308 --> 01:16:46,005
For from the wretched forces of evil,
a new cry of hope went up.

889
01:16:49,982 --> 01:16:51,574
The Black Fleet!

890
01:16:52,418 --> 01:16:54,579
That which I dreaded had happened.

891
01:16:54,787 --> 01:16:58,348
For if enemy-laden ships had come
from this direction...

892
01:16:58,457 --> 01:17:03,190
...it meant that the black forces had
already conquered Ethir and Lebennin...

893
01:17:03,462 --> 01:17:05,987
...lands we had thought safely ours.

894
01:17:12,505 --> 01:17:15,531
The tide had turned still one more time...

895
01:17:15,975 --> 01:17:18,375
...and this time, against us!

896
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:22,479
But behold!

897
01:17:22,915 --> 01:17:25,748
As the flagship's standard broke the wind...

898
01:17:25,885 --> 01:17:29,218
...it displayed the sign no lord
had borne for years...

899
01:17:29,455 --> 01:17:32,049
...and which only one lord could bear:

900
01:17:33,225 --> 01:17:36,888
Aragon! He who would be our king...

901
01:17:37,129 --> 01:17:38,323
...had returned!

902
01:17:43,068 --> 01:17:46,231
And the hosts of Mordor
were seized with bewilderment...

903
01:17:46,405 --> 01:17:48,032
...and they fled.

904
01:17:50,176 --> 01:17:52,235
That night we held council.

905
01:17:53,212 --> 01:17:55,908
While Aragorn had the enemy on the run...

906
01:17:55,981 --> 01:17:58,415
...he decided to pursue them into Mordor...

907
01:17:58,851 --> 01:18:01,081
...across the Gorgoroth Plateau...

908
01:18:01,287 --> 01:18:06,088
...and to the bastion of Sauron himself,
the Dark Tower of Barad-dur.

909
01:18:07,526 --> 01:18:10,791
The shortest way would be
through the pass at Cirith Ungol.

910
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:14,197
But that is narrow and dangerous
to move an army through.

911
01:18:14,266 --> 01:18:17,702
And so he decided to march
along the mountains, north...

912
01:18:17,870 --> 01:18:19,360
...and then west...

913
01:18:19,438 --> 01:18:22,430
...to the haunted pass of Cirith Gorgor...

914
01:18:22,508 --> 01:18:25,534
...and the untold legions of the Black Lord.

915
01:18:26,512 --> 01:18:28,309
Why so glum, Wizard?

916
01:18:28,781 --> 01:18:33,013
Does the mere thought of Sauron's
vast forces overwhelm your spirit?

917
01:18:33,552 --> 01:18:35,884
This war is without final hope.

918
01:18:36,255 --> 01:18:38,985
Victory cannot be achieved
by force of arms...

919
01:18:39,225 --> 01:18:41,955
...whether you sit here to endure
siege after siege...

920
01:18:42,027 --> 01:18:44,222
...or march out to be overwhelmed.

921
01:18:44,496 --> 01:18:46,259
You have only a choice of evils!

922
01:18:46,632 --> 01:18:49,294
Then, if the choice be mine...

923
01:18:49,969 --> 01:18:52,130
...I choose to march!

924
01:18:54,707 --> 01:18:57,175
And for days and nights march we did.

925
01:18:57,543 --> 01:18:59,443
But my spirit was leaden.

926
01:19:07,553 --> 01:19:11,250
"Win the battle, lose the war

927
01:19:11,523 --> 01:19:15,892
"Choice of evils lie before your feet

928
01:19:17,162 --> 01:19:20,029
"Retreat, retreat, retreat"

929
01:19:24,670 --> 01:19:27,002
And finally, the pass.

930
01:19:28,007 --> 01:19:30,669
Guarded by The Towers of the Teeth.

931
01:19:31,176 --> 01:19:34,873
And inside, the Orcs made song
to match my spirit.

932
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:38,607
"If you win then you will lose

933
01:19:38,984 --> 01:19:42,351
"Choice of evils yours to choose

934
01:19:42,421 --> 01:19:47,381
"Retreat, retreat, retreat

935
01:19:50,162 --> 01:19:53,825
"You are standing in the eye of the storm

936
01:19:54,166 --> 01:19:57,624
"Move an inch and you'll be dead

937
01:19:58,137 --> 01:20:00,264
"You are standing underneath

938
01:20:00,339 --> 01:20:05,208
"The Towers of the Teeth
and the Eye blazes red

939
01:20:06,378 --> 01:20:10,109
"Win the battle lose the war

940
01:20:10,416 --> 01:20:14,785
"Choice of evils lie before your feet

941
01:20:16,055 --> 01:20:19,047
"Retreat, retreat, retreat"

942
01:20:19,224 --> 01:20:20,452
Silence!

943
01:20:22,361 --> 01:20:24,124
Come forth!

944
01:20:24,797 --> 01:20:26,924
The King of Gondor...

945
01:20:26,999 --> 01:20:30,162
...demands the Black Lord to come forth...

946
01:20:30,302 --> 01:20:34,102
...atone for his evils
and depart them forever!

947
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:36,105
Come forth!

948
01:20:55,461 --> 01:20:58,259
I am the mouth of Sauron!

949
01:20:58,831 --> 01:21:01,095
His emissary, you mean.

950
01:21:01,166 --> 01:21:04,294
For you be no wraith,
but made from flesh and blood...

951
01:21:04,370 --> 01:21:08,602
...beneath that mask
and those robes, even as I!

952
01:21:09,475 --> 01:21:14,378
Is there anyone in this rout
with authority to treat with me?

953
01:21:14,747 --> 01:21:16,908
Not thou, Aragorn.

954
01:21:16,982 --> 01:21:20,850
It needs more to make a king
than a rabble such as this.

955
01:21:21,553 --> 01:21:23,020
We shall see!

956
01:21:23,455 --> 01:21:24,786
Be warned.

957
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:28,448
You are hopelessly outnumbered here.

958
01:21:28,527 --> 01:21:30,188
Our decision is made.

959
01:21:30,362 --> 01:21:31,556
Be gone!

960
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:35,627
We did not come here to waste words
in treating with the likes of you...

961
01:21:36,201 --> 01:21:38,226
...one of Sauron's slaves.

962
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:39,864
Be gone!

963
01:21:40,305 --> 01:21:42,773
We will meet your armies!

964
01:21:48,647 --> 01:21:51,878
"You are standing in the eye of the storm

965
01:21:52,484 --> 01:21:56,420
"Move an inch and you'll be dead

966
01:21:56,488 --> 01:22:00,481
"You are standing underneath
The Towers of the Teeth

967
01:22:00,592 --> 01:22:04,153
"And the Eye blazes red"

968
01:22:08,834 --> 01:22:11,530
As I faced my own, almost certain death...

969
01:22:11,904 --> 01:22:14,702
...I wondered, "Has he the Ring?

970
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:17,306
"Has Sauron really got the Ring?

971
01:22:17,643 --> 01:22:19,611
"Where is the Ring?"

972
01:22:23,582 --> 01:22:26,449
Had I but known that deep
in the bowels of Mount Doom...

973
01:22:26,518 --> 01:22:30,978
...Samwise had been searching
these many days for his master...

974
01:22:31,290 --> 01:22:35,989
...until he himself had reached the core,
the fiery forge itself.

975
01:22:38,397 --> 01:22:40,422
And this, at last, is it...

976
01:22:41,033 --> 01:22:43,058
...the end of Frodo's quest.

977
01:22:43,202 --> 01:22:47,332
But instead of his triumph,
it ends with his madness.

978
01:22:48,874 --> 01:22:50,273
What's that?

979
01:22:53,178 --> 01:22:54,167
Gollum!

980
01:22:54,513 --> 01:22:55,639
Here?

981
01:22:56,014 --> 01:22:58,676
Fighting with something that is not there?

982
01:22:59,318 --> 01:23:01,081
Mr. Frodo!

983
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,512
Invisible!

984
01:23:04,790 --> 01:23:09,784
"Frodo of the nine fingers

985
01:23:11,063 --> 01:23:14,226
"And the Ring of Doom

986
01:23:15,734 --> 01:23:20,103
"Why does he have nine fingers"

987
01:23:38,924 --> 01:23:40,653
Mr. Frodo!

988
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:46,754
"Where is the Ring of Doom?"

989
01:23:56,174 --> 01:23:58,768
Precious! Precious!

990
01:24:00,178 --> 01:24:02,703
My Precious!

991
01:24:07,452 --> 01:24:10,285
My master! Your poor hand!

992
01:24:10,355 --> 01:24:12,186
My master!

993
01:24:12,257 --> 01:24:13,588
'Tis better this way!

994
01:24:13,659 --> 01:24:16,150
'Tis better than that madness!

995
01:24:17,329 --> 01:24:18,318
Look!

996
01:24:18,530 --> 01:24:19,519
Mine!

997
01:24:26,872 --> 01:24:28,931
Precious!

998
01:24:34,346 --> 01:24:36,678
Gollum has completed our quest.

999
01:24:37,115 --> 01:24:41,313
The Ring is destroyed in the fires
where it was wrought!

1000
01:24:41,987 --> 01:24:43,249
At last...

1001
01:24:43,355 --> 01:24:46,324
...the Ring exists no more!

1002
01:24:50,462 --> 01:24:51,759
She's erupting!

1003
01:24:52,097 --> 01:24:55,294
Quick, master,
back through these cracks, run.

1004
01:25:40,445 --> 01:25:42,242
All Mordor is being destroyed!

1005
01:25:42,648 --> 01:25:43,774
How?

1006
01:25:44,082 --> 01:25:46,983
How? There is but one answer.

1007
01:25:47,519 --> 01:25:50,044
The ring bearer has fulfilled his quest.

1008
01:25:50,489 --> 01:25:52,514
The realm of Sauron is ended!

1009
01:25:52,924 --> 01:25:54,585
And with him, us!

1010
01:25:54,826 --> 01:25:57,624
For the quake cannot tell good from evil.

1011
01:25:58,230 --> 01:26:00,596
Look! See ye!

1012
01:26:05,671 --> 01:26:07,969
The Lord of the Eagles and his legions!

1013
01:26:08,273 --> 01:26:10,537
Our armies are saved!

1014
01:26:21,086 --> 01:26:23,577
It's no use! The lava will have us!

1015
01:26:24,356 --> 01:26:28,190
I am glad you are with me
here at the end of all things, Sam.

1016
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:30,428
And you with me, master.

1017
01:26:31,830 --> 01:26:34,128
I don't want to give up yet.

1018
01:26:34,566 --> 01:26:37,501
It's not like me somehow,
if you understand.

1019
01:26:37,803 --> 01:26:41,796
Maybe not, Sam.
But it's like things are in the world.

1020
01:26:42,808 --> 01:26:43,968
Hopes fail.

1021
01:26:44,476 --> 01:26:45,875
An end comes.

1022
01:26:46,445 --> 01:26:48,174
There is no escape.

1023
01:27:21,646 --> 01:27:23,876
Die well, Samwise!

1024
01:27:39,798 --> 01:27:41,322
Yes, once again...

1025
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:44,567
...as he had so many times in the past...

1026
01:27:45,103 --> 01:27:49,699
...Gwaihir, the magnificent Lord of
The Eagles, had come to our rescue.

1027
01:27:50,509 --> 01:27:53,740
The mighty war birds
returned us to Minas-Tirith...

1028
01:27:54,179 --> 01:27:55,646
...where months later...

1029
01:27:56,148 --> 01:27:59,481
...our dead buried, our wounded healed...

1030
01:27:59,885 --> 01:28:03,377
...the fields of Pelennor
green with springtime...

1031
01:28:03,488 --> 01:28:05,649
...the city cleansed and rebuilt...

1032
01:28:06,024 --> 01:28:09,289
...the standard of King Aragorn
was raised finally...

1033
01:28:09,528 --> 01:28:11,758
...to the top of the White Tower.

1034
01:28:12,230 --> 01:28:15,597
And down below,
the restored Great Gate swung open...

1035
01:28:16,601 --> 01:28:20,901
...and King Aragorn officially
took possession of his capital city.

1036
01:28:22,207 --> 01:28:24,505
Behold! The return of the King!

1037
01:28:24,776 --> 01:28:29,406
"The end of the Ring, the return of the King

01:30:05,844 --> 01:30:09,678
"Healing hand"

1059
01:30:20,425 --> 01:30:24,191
"Frodo of the nine fingers

1060
01:30:24,930 --> 01:30:29,867
"And the Ring of Doom"

1061
01:30:31,703 --> 01:30:33,193
And now we all know.

1062
01:30:33,838 --> 01:30:35,465
But alas, look.

1063
01:30:40,145 --> 01:30:42,909
Just resting my eyes.

1064
01:30:43,715 --> 01:30:47,549
Sweet Bilbo, you will return with us
tomorrow to Hobbitown...

1065
01:30:47,919 --> 01:30:50,786
...where you may rest your eyes
as much as you wish.

1066
01:30:51,323 --> 01:30:52,551
Return?

1067
01:30:52,991 --> 01:30:54,185
Nay.

1068
01:30:54,259 --> 01:30:55,590
On the morrow...

1069
01:30:55,660 --> 01:30:59,562
...I depart with Elrond and Gandalf.

1070
01:31:00,098 --> 01:31:01,292
Depart?

1071
01:31:01,399 --> 01:31:03,367
From the Gray Havens.

1072
01:31:03,768 --> 01:31:06,100
On the white ship.

1073
01:31:06,638 --> 01:31:08,230
What means this?

1074
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:11,532
We are old, our job is done.

1075
01:31:13,078 --> 01:31:15,740
The Third Age of Middle-earth is over...

1076
01:31:16,181 --> 01:31:19,014
...and as we pass on to the lands
beyond the sea...

1077
01:31:19,084 --> 01:31:22,576
...the new age of Man begins.

1078
01:31:22,654 --> 01:31:24,246
I shall miss you.

1079
01:31:24,723 --> 01:31:27,317
But I thought only Elves departed thus.

1080
01:31:27,392 --> 01:31:29,257
How can Bilbo join you?

1081
01:31:29,327 --> 01:31:31,227
Bilbo has served us well.

1082
01:31:31,663 --> 01:31:34,131
There is always room for a friend.

1083
01:31:34,532 --> 01:31:37,057
Have I served thee well?

1084
01:31:37,202 --> 01:31:39,170
Need you ask such a question?

1085
01:31:41,606 --> 01:31:44,040
I have grown weary of this world.

1086
01:31:44,242 --> 01:31:46,836
The weight of the Ring all of these years...

1087
01:31:47,045 --> 01:31:49,206
...has worn me far beyond my age.

1088
01:31:50,048 --> 01:31:52,414
I would, if it pleases you...

1089
01:31:52,617 --> 01:31:54,915
...set sail with you on the morrow.

1090
01:31:56,054 --> 01:31:59,888
Good friend,
savior of all we hold precious...

1091
01:32:00,558 --> 01:32:02,719
...of course thou might join us.

1092
01:32:03,261 --> 01:32:04,592
Mr. Frodo.

1093
01:32:04,929 --> 01:32:06,726
We cannot be parted.

1094
01:32:07,565 --> 01:32:09,999
But, must I go, too?

1095
01:32:10,602 --> 01:32:12,035
Nay, dear Sam.

1096
01:32:12,170 --> 01:32:14,468
You are still young in spirit.

1097
01:32:14,706 --> 01:32:16,799
You and Merry and Pippin.

1098
01:32:17,509 --> 01:32:20,273
A good life awaits you back in the Shire.

1099
01:32:20,345 --> 01:32:22,404
With plump Hobbit wives...

1100
01:32:22,614 --> 01:32:24,548
...good Hobbit meals...

1101
01:32:24,616 --> 01:32:28,746
...Iong leisurely smokings
of good Hobbit pipes.

1102
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:32,155
And laps filled
with bouncing Hobbit babies.

1103
01:32:33,158 --> 01:32:36,924
Now you must keep the book
of the Hobbits up to date.

1104
01:32:39,364 --> 01:32:40,456
I will.

1105
01:32:41,666 --> 01:32:44,328
The Orcs and Trolls have gone to dust...

1106
01:32:45,036 --> 01:32:47,504
...the Elves are slowly departing.

1107
01:32:48,206 --> 01:32:51,300
Dwarves have disappeared
into their misty mountains...

1108
01:32:52,310 --> 01:32:54,870
...and there have been no dragons for ages.

1109
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:56,640
Right!

1110
01:32:58,650 --> 01:33:00,447
What troubles you, Sam?

1111
01:33:00,518 --> 01:33:04,352
Will there be no room for Hobbits
in this new age of Man?

1112
01:33:04,856 --> 01:33:09,156
I think so. For of us all,
Hobbits are the closest to Man...

1113
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:10,386
...the most human.

1114
01:33:10,795 --> 01:33:13,525
And one day they will be as Men are.

1115
01:33:13,731 --> 01:33:14,993
Look you.

1116
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:20,164
Frodo is a bit larger than Bilbo,
just as you are larger than Frodo.

1117
01:33:20,605 --> 01:33:24,541
And younger still than you,
and larger are Merry and Pippin.

1118
01:33:25,844 --> 01:33:29,075
And, if you keep the book
of the Hobbits as Frodo asked...

1119
01:33:29,214 --> 01:33:32,411
...ages from now,
when your stories are still told...

1120
01:33:32,917 --> 01:33:37,877
...there will be those humans who might
well wonder, "Is there Hobbit in me?"

1121
01:33:39,424 --> 01:33:40,686
Is there?

1122
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:45,359
"Roads go ever, ever on

1123
01:33:48,666 --> 01:33:51,999
"To the lands beyond the sea

1124
01:33:55,206 --> 01:33:58,505
"On a white ship will I sail

1125
01:34:01,446 --> 01:34:05,439
"Watching shadows part for me

1126
01:34:08,019 --> 01:34:12,046
"Leaving havens gray with rain

1127
01:34:14,726 --> 01:34:18,685
"Now that years have slipped away

1128
01:34:21,232 --> 01:34:24,668
"Leaving friends with gentle pain

1129
01:34:27,605 --> 01:34:31,132
"As they start another day

1130
01:34:34,078 --> 01:34:37,878
"Roads I traveled I must leave

1131
01:34:40,585 --> 01:34:44,077
"For I've turned the final bend

1132
01:34:46,991 --> 01:34:51,155
"Weep not empty tears but grieve

1133
01:34:53,565 --> 01:34:58,468
"As the road comes to an end

1134
01:35:00,238 --> 01:35:04,834
"It's so easy not to try

1135
01:35:06,778 --> 01:35:10,805
"Let the world go drifting by

1136
01:35:13,151 --> 01:35:16,314
"If you never say hello

1137
01:35:19,691 --> 01:35:22,922
"You won't have to say goodbye"

1138
01:35:29,067 --> 01:35:31,501
And lo, as foretold...

1139
01:35:31,569 --> 01:35:35,027
...the epoch of The Return of the King
ends at the beginning...

1140
01:35:35,139 --> 01:35:37,699
...of the new age of Man.

1141
01:35:38,977 --> 01:35:42,413
"If you never say hello

1142
01:35:45,850 --> 01:35:50,685
"You won't have to say goodbye"
