00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:02,278
'If Lost Look Back To Where
You Came From'
African Proverb

2
00:01:12,687 --> 00:01:17,966
The Autobus By RMC 

3
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:21,437
Get going, you idiot!

4
00:01:28,847 --> 00:01:31,202
They scorn it
but they don't know its true value

5
00:01:31,327 --> 00:01:33,158
Move on, move on

6
00:01:33,607 --> 00:01:35,996
In 1943, it was one of a kind

7
00:01:41,127 --> 00:01:43,004
Your father bought it

8
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,804
Its chassis was made in England

9
00:01:49,927 --> 00:01:52,680
Its design in Italy

10
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:55,805
And its engine made in Germany

11
00:01:56,047 --> 00:01:57,480
Good as gold

12
00:01:57,687 --> 00:02:03,557
Runs 1 70 km/h with 30 passengers

13
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:18,479
Come on, move!

14
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:31,485
You need to pee on the wound to heal it

15
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:37,159
You're joking, right?

16
00:02:38,287 --> 00:02:39,879
Water will do the job

17
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:43,597
This is pure juice

18
00:02:43,967 --> 00:02:46,162
This will get it going forever

19
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:52,281
This isn't going to work pal
It broke down

20
00:02:52,447 --> 00:02:55,996
Do you have any more of your brilliant
ideas, you and your friend?

21
00:02:56,127 --> 00:02:57,606
Push, will you, just push!

22
00:03:03,247 --> 00:03:07,206
Easy guys, this isn't going to work!

23
00:03:07,407 --> 00:03:09,159
That's it, I'll get off and help

24
00:03:09,687 --> 00:03:12,042
You step out, and just watch how it rolls

25
00:03:12,207 --> 00:03:15,040
It's only stopped because you're so thick

26
00:03:32,447 --> 00:03:38,158
The show is a few hours away
and here we are, with a battery full of piss!

27
00:03:38,527 --> 00:03:40,324
Never loose faith, son!

28
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:50,522
jeez, where's the state?

29
00:04:49,407 --> 00:04:53,002
Don't worry kids
This bus is going to change your lives

30
00:05:16,127 --> 00:05:17,401
Alia!

31
00:05:55,607 --> 00:06:01,523
Three Weeks Earlier

32
00:06:28,327 --> 00:06:29,999
Where do you think you're going?

33
00:06:37,407 --> 00:06:39,637
This wreck still works?

34
00:06:39,927 --> 00:06:43,886
It's not a wreck. It's a piece of art

35
00:06:49,487 --> 00:06:51,079
What's your name?

36
00:06:53,767 --> 00:06:55,598
I'm looking for the cafeteria...

37
00:06:56,607 --> 00:06:58,438
Hungry I suppose?

38
00:06:59,087 --> 00:07:01,476
How about a shawarma sandwish?

39
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,515
Go on, out!

40
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:14,879
You said you're looking for the cafeteria?
Follow me!

41
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:44,885
There's nothing left...

42
00:07:52,407 --> 00:07:55,843
You won't find what
you're looking for in the cafeteria

43
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,682
Let me make you some coffee

44
00:08:02,447 --> 00:08:07,646
It has just been grinded, Kamal Maffousse!

45
00:08:11,087 --> 00:08:13,681
I've known you since you were this high

46
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:18,365
You didn't recognize me
Must be my new look

47
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:28,126
You look so much like your father
may he rest in peace

48
00:08:28,527 --> 00:08:30,882
Mr. Nabil, a real gentleman

49
00:08:33,007 --> 00:08:35,726
Come here give me a hug!

50
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,761
- It's Vola's fault
- No, it's Arze's fault

51
00:08:58,887 --> 00:09:00,764
You're the one who fell!!

52
00:09:01,327 --> 00:09:05,445
Whoever's fault it was, it was a disaster!

53
00:09:06,007 --> 00:09:07,565
- Good morning
- Good morning

54
00:09:07,687 --> 00:09:10,076
I have a package for Mr. Nabil Maffousse

55
00:09:11,607 --> 00:09:13,325
Dad! A gift for you!

56
00:09:13,447 --> 00:09:15,438
- From who?
- From...

57
00:09:16,047 --> 00:09:17,560
From me!

58
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:19,996
You know I am the only one to care for you

59
00:09:21,607 --> 00:09:24,167
I thought you were practicing so you wouldn't
get embarrassed all over again!

60
00:09:25,327 --> 00:09:27,238
But you're responsible too

61
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,201
I told you yesterday the stage was slippery

62
00:09:30,327 --> 00:09:32,238
So why is it that the kids didn't fall?

63
00:09:32,727 --> 00:09:35,560
On stage everyone!
Let's show Mr. Boss here

64
00:09:35,687 --> 00:09:38,645
who we were, who we are now
and who we'll always be

65
00:09:38,807 --> 00:09:40,604
Number one!

66
00:09:40,927 --> 00:09:43,680
What a great example for future generations!

67
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:46,765
I'm counting on you Alia

68
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,362
Don't worry! It's you I'm dancing for

69
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:59,957
You are making fun?
I promise I will show you

70
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,758
Stretch more Khalil

71
00:10:17,607 --> 00:10:19,996
- I'm all stiff
- You need some greasing

72
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:23,604
And you, you have a doctor's
note saying you can't warm up?

73
00:10:23,727 --> 00:10:25,399
Do you have to be such a pain in the ass?

74
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:27,483
He can't be any other way

75
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:31,122
Kamal, darling, I'm here to make you famous

76
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:33,522
Not to sweat on your 1 and 2 and 3

77
00:10:33,647 --> 00:10:36,639
The interview is supposed to be with
the whole group, or just with you?

78
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:40,966
Honey, when there's icing on the cake
you don't look at the rest, no?

79
00:10:41,527 --> 00:10:43,245
Now, take close ups on the faces

80
00:10:45,487 --> 00:10:49,082
We all know that all you've done is a bit
of dubbing. So get started will you!

81
00:10:51,047 --> 00:10:53,720
So. That was the opening of a tights
store in the Armenian neighbourhood

82
00:10:54,727 --> 00:10:58,037
Look, this is my teddy
Can't sleep without him!

83
00:10:59,487 --> 00:11:03,002
And this is my first music video
It was a big hit

84
00:11:03,127 --> 00:11:04,845
I was the big hit!

85
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:06,844
Where's your cameraman?
Why isn't he filming us?

86
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,886
Your time's up!
Excuse me miss

87
00:11:10,727 --> 00:11:13,116
But if it's our troupe
(get lost!)

88
00:11:13,327 --> 00:11:16,524
you're interested in
this album is probably much better

89
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:22,445
These damn stilettos, they break my back!
How am I supposed to dance like this?

90
00:11:22,527 --> 00:11:24,916
Why don't you wear tennis
shoes like everyone else!

91
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:29,165
Flatties? Right, that should
be a real cock-teaser!

92
00:11:30,287 --> 00:11:32,118
You're not filming are you?

93
00:11:32,247 --> 00:11:34,841
Guys! Don't you see it's our last chance?

94
00:11:37,527 --> 00:11:39,518
It's easy for you to preach

95
00:11:40,607 --> 00:11:42,757
You have no idea what you're talking about

96
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:50,285
Did you hear? I think it's our turn

97
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:54,926
Alia

98
00:11:56,687 --> 00:11:59,838
Don't worry! It's you I'm dancing for

99
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:07,240
- My name is Arzé
- Pleasure

100
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:14,523
I, too, used to dance with them but now,
there's only room for the skinny! awful, huh?

101
00:12:15,327 --> 00:12:16,965
Even my boobs dropped!

102
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:19,598
Look, this was when we just started out

103
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:21,962
That's when we got our first prize

104
00:12:22,127 --> 00:12:24,277
- Who's this?
- The one handing the prize?

105
00:12:24,967 --> 00:12:27,527
That's Nabil Mafousse, Kamal's father
God rest his soul

106
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:30,725
It's true, he was always strict with us
But we loved him

107
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:36,562
He didn't know much about dancing
But he was a genius, a real pioneer

108
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,880
You know, our school wasn't just any school

109
00:12:40,007 --> 00:12:41,759
It was an idea

110
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:47,559
He wanted a school without any social
gender or religious differences

111
00:12:48,687 --> 00:12:49,722
Look here

112
00:13:02,327 --> 00:13:04,443
NATIONAL DABKEH FESTIVAL OF ANjAR

113
00:14:32,647 --> 00:14:34,319
Who are these people?

114
00:14:34,487 --> 00:14:37,479
The Utopia College of Aley?

115
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:40,362
Is this a joke?

116
00:14:41,207 --> 00:14:43,960
It is the name of our old school, mister...

117
00:14:44,487 --> 00:14:46,239
Oh the dropouts' school, right?

118
00:14:46,647 --> 00:14:50,799
If you please, many are waiting their turn

119
00:14:52,247 --> 00:14:53,965
May we know the reason?

120
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:57,962
This isn't a dabkeh
You have no right to call this a dabkeh

121
00:14:58,167 --> 00:15:01,523
This is a mix of sufi, eastern, western

122
00:15:01,687 --> 00:15:04,121
It is imported from I don't where

123
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:09,361
You sir, are using the glory
of your past to make it glittery

124
00:15:10,007 --> 00:15:12,885
Is that enough of an explanation?

125
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,965
No, it isn't

126
00:15:16,287 --> 00:15:18,437
How arrogant!

127
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:21,965
You disregard your identity
and you don't even care!

128
00:15:22,327 --> 00:15:25,319
There is a limit to this cultural invasion!

129
00:15:25,727 --> 00:15:27,683
No Lebanese speaks arabic anymore

130
00:15:28,207 --> 00:15:29,925
And our girls are all blonde!

131
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:34,645
And you sir, you dare attack
our last cultural heritage

132
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,400
The dabkeh?

133
00:15:36,847 --> 00:15:40,806
Lebanese, does this word
mean anything to you?

134
00:15:40,927 --> 00:15:44,806
- Stop it!
- Get out, before I call security

135
00:15:44,927 --> 00:15:47,566
It's all my fault, I knew I shouldn't come

136
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,045
Let's go Kamal

137
00:15:52,487 --> 00:15:54,125
Let's go!

138
00:16:03,687 --> 00:16:06,076
- I hate you Kamal, I hate you!
- Let it out honey

139
00:16:06,207 --> 00:16:08,675
Use my padding as a punching
ball if it makes you feel better

140
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:12,842
He was right! This ducks' dance
of yours is no dabkeh!

141
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:17,199
We've been through this enough already
This is a contemporary dabkeh, a modern one!

142
00:16:17,647 --> 00:16:22,721
Modern! Fusion, world!
Hummus, soy sauce, tabbuleh!

143
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:28,524
- Whatever, but it certainly isn't dabkeh!
- Honey, it's your stomach that's gone global!

144
00:16:28,647 --> 00:16:32,276
Maybe my stomach is a dump
But not my ears!

145
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:38,526
I don't mean to intrude
But I have to tell you, you were great!

146
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:40,041
Auntie?!

147
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:45,241
My darling, you were 100% magnificent!
just splendid

148
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:47,479
See!

149
00:16:48,327 --> 00:16:52,115
Great or not, I'm not buying this

150
00:16:56,247 --> 00:16:58,158
I have a question for you sir

151
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:01,681
Who do you think you are
to tell me how I am supposed to think?

152
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:05,199
Your tie, where is it from?
Italy, or Taiwan?

153
00:17:05,847 --> 00:17:07,997
Or did you get it from your
so-called heritage Mr. Barakat?

154
00:17:08,887 --> 00:17:12,038
In what supermarket can we
get some of this heritage?

155
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:20,205
The dabkeh, sir, is alive, just like us
it breathes, evolves, adapts

156
00:17:22,527 --> 00:17:27,237
You're still hanging on to a bygone
Lebanon And there's no turning back

157
00:17:27,487 --> 00:17:29,478
The road is blocked

158
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,481
So why this longing for something
that's been ravaged and killed?

159
00:18:06,447 --> 00:18:10,201
How can it work out?
Each within a private struggle

160
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:14,121
Locked in lies
Hidden, secluded

161
00:18:14,287 --> 00:18:16,164
Even love falls apart

162
00:18:16,287 --> 00:18:20,200
Too scared to open up
Too scared to move on

163
00:18:20,327 --> 00:18:22,238
How can it work out?

164
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:29,801
This man worries
Wakes from sleep in a sweat:

165
00:18:29,927 --> 00:18:35,365
He knows the past can't
Be forgotten or laid to rest

166
00:18:39,087 --> 00:18:43,126
Locked in lies
Hidden, secluded

167
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:50,722
This man won't take chances
Except through his dancing

168
00:18:50,847 --> 00:18:55,967
And here my friend
It's doomed to end

169
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:03,676
Locked in lies
Hidden, secluded

170
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:11,521
Between two take-aways
This man's life is fading away

171
00:19:11,727 --> 00:19:16,926
He's gonna get white hair
And his daddy still won't care

172
00:19:20,887 --> 00:19:24,846
Locked in lies
Hidden, secluded

173
00:19:27,247 --> 00:19:30,603
Here's Vola, Sweet Vola...

174
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:37,646
Why did you stop?

175
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:40,644
I don't feel it

176
00:19:41,007 --> 00:19:43,043
Maybe I can raise the pitch higher

177
00:19:43,527 --> 00:19:45,199
No. It was good

178
00:19:45,927 --> 00:19:47,485
Are you sure?

179
00:19:47,607 --> 00:19:49,199
Yes

180
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:53,675
Take it again, but please, don't stop

181
00:19:56,087 --> 00:20:06,235
Locked in lies
Hidden, secluded

182
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:08,486
That's it

183
00:20:09,807 --> 00:20:11,286
What?

184
00:20:11,407 --> 00:20:13,079
You got the the right tone

185
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:15,926
Alia, can you take it again, same level?

186
00:20:18,847 --> 00:20:21,236
Ok
Let me drink first

187
00:20:26,127 --> 00:20:29,403
What's funny, is that I've been working
on this music for 15 years

188
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:33,918
And it's only now that
I found your voice for it

189
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:40,160
Maybe if you clean up this place a bit

190
00:20:40,727 --> 00:20:45,278
it will Help you tie all
the loose ends you left hanging

191
00:20:46,607 --> 00:20:48,598
The only thing missing was your voice

192
00:20:52,927 --> 00:20:55,646
So I'm your muse now, Mr. Mafousse?

193
00:21:11,967 --> 00:21:13,639
Shall we go on?

194
00:21:15,927 --> 00:21:17,804
If you don't want to continue, just say so

195
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:20,204
Are we back to the same old story?

196
00:21:20,327 --> 00:21:22,636
We've been practicing for two months now
We're all exhausted

197
00:21:22,767 --> 00:21:25,645
All we're asking for is
one week to take a break

198
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,919
Is that too much to ask from the boss?

199
00:21:28,927 --> 00:21:30,724
You want a week?

200
00:21:31,127 --> 00:21:32,765
You got it

201
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:41,841
Here's Vola, sweet Vola:
Reaching for love

202
00:21:42,127 --> 00:21:47,247
Playing her life as if on screen
Trying to fulfill her dreams

203
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:52,600
Weaving endless illusions
To hide her deceptions

204
00:21:52,727 --> 00:21:57,801
Here's Vola, sweet Vola:
Reaching for love

205
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:10,316
Hi sweetie
How are you?

206
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:19,963
So, how long before your
Mrs. calls her pet back home?

207
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:23,763
45 minutes maximum

208
00:22:28,207 --> 00:22:29,799
You know what?

209
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,803
I've had it with your timing shit

210
00:22:34,127 --> 00:22:36,800
A woman like me
you have to appreciate her

211
00:22:40,087 --> 00:22:42,681
How many times did I tell you
I don't want to see his face

212
00:22:46,647 --> 00:22:48,956
It's my father, and this is his place

213
00:22:49,207 --> 00:22:51,641
I take it you haven't changed the locks either

214
00:22:53,887 --> 00:22:56,117
Afraid your best friend might catch us?

215
00:22:59,447 --> 00:23:01,483
It's high time you turned the page

216
00:23:02,727 --> 00:23:04,877
You don't even ask me how it went?

217
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:08,559
What happened?

218
00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:14,084
What kills me most is that
there won't be anymore rehearsals

219
00:23:16,927 --> 00:23:18,645
It's over

220
00:23:21,247 --> 00:23:23,283
Oh, the dabkeh!

221
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:28,038
Don't tell me you were planning
to stay with these idiots

222
00:23:28,927 --> 00:23:30,963
Come now, sit here darling

223
00:23:49,807 --> 00:23:52,605
Pack your stuff and leave

224
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:55,719
Because I'm not in the mood

225
00:23:56,367 --> 00:23:59,916
Not today, not tomorrow, not the day after

226
00:24:00,527 --> 00:24:03,519
just get the fuck out

227
00:24:10,767 --> 00:24:14,680
Locked in lies
Hidden, secluded

228
00:24:14,807 --> 00:24:18,516
Nothing improves:
We're tired of being broke

229
00:24:18,647 --> 00:24:22,401
Sick of this legacy
That makes our lives a joke

230
00:24:22,607 --> 00:24:24,359
All for illusions of past glories

231
00:24:24,487 --> 00:24:30,084
just for once let's sing out
And through us let there be joy

232
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:34,883
For once let's sing out
And through us, let there be joy

233
00:24:50,807 --> 00:24:53,765
I thought I could get out of this rotten prison

234
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:56,364
When my father sent me to study abroad

235
00:24:56,487 --> 00:24:58,000
I thought I was free

236
00:24:59,887 --> 00:25:02,799
After two years, I thought I could tell him

237
00:25:03,407 --> 00:25:05,238
I came here for one week

238
00:25:05,527 --> 00:25:08,758
just to do that and then leave again

239
00:25:10,447 --> 00:25:12,244
At the time, I was doing fine

240
00:25:12,367 --> 00:25:16,155
I had a three-year contract
with a big German danse company

241
00:25:19,407 --> 00:25:23,286
But as soon as I got here

242
00:25:23,727 --> 00:25:26,685
The war broke out in the South
It was really ugly

243
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:29,882
The German embassy wouldn't renew my visa

244
00:25:30,727 --> 00:25:33,605
I showed them my med school papers
They rejected me four times!

245
00:25:33,727 --> 00:25:36,287
I tried France, no way!
England, don't even think about it!

246
00:25:37,247 --> 00:25:39,442
And the US, they didn't even
look at my passport!

247
00:25:41,647 --> 00:25:45,481
Omar
The name itself is a crime

248
00:25:50,607 --> 00:25:52,563
Whatever brought you back here, Kamal?

249
00:25:53,287 --> 00:25:57,519
Everyone here wants to go away, and you
You come back rubbing salt on old wounds

250
00:26:03,127 --> 00:26:06,358
Don't worry
It will be fine

251
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:10,764
You don't realize what you're asking
What's it to you?

252
00:26:11,767 --> 00:26:16,283
If it works, all the better for you, but if it
doesn't, you just go back to your country

253
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:20,286
- You got the citizenship, right?
- Yes

254
00:26:22,767 --> 00:26:24,405
Lucky you!

255
00:26:27,207 --> 00:26:29,482
What about the others?
How are you planning on winning them over?

256
00:26:30,287 --> 00:26:32,198
I have a surprise for them

257
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:53,564
This is the CD

258
00:26:53,727 --> 00:26:55,957
I might use it for my story

259
00:26:58,087 --> 00:27:03,161
You know, my grandma's name is Isabelle

260
00:27:04,127 --> 00:27:05,480
Really!

261
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:09,239
I used to get such beatings from her!

262
00:27:10,967 --> 00:27:13,720
I like beating men too

263
00:27:20,327 --> 00:27:21,999
Would you like to come in?

264
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:25,599
No thanks
Maybe another time

265
00:27:27,047 --> 00:27:28,560
As you wish

266
00:28:32,527 --> 00:28:35,963
She got invited to this TV show

267
00:28:36,207 --> 00:28:39,165
And you know her, the minute she hears
the word TV she goes all nuts

268
00:28:39,287 --> 00:28:42,006
So she goes to the doctor
and gets her lips stuffed with silicone

269
00:28:42,327 --> 00:28:43,919
- Stuffed with what?
- Silicone

270
00:28:44,047 --> 00:28:46,641
- No way!
- just imagine what she looked like after!

271
00:28:47,327 --> 00:28:49,477
That's why she cancelled the show!
She said she had a running fever

272
00:28:49,607 --> 00:28:51,245
Well done, she's always lying anyway

273
00:28:51,367 --> 00:28:55,724
- Well, well look who's finally here
- How are you auntie Haifa?

274
00:28:55,847 --> 00:28:58,281
How are you?

275
00:28:58,407 --> 00:29:01,843
Your cousins called. We are all going together
to pay our condolences for your great-uncle

276
00:29:01,967 --> 00:29:04,686
Tomorrow at five
I told them ok

277
00:29:05,087 --> 00:29:07,806
Unless you have other plans?

278
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:10,717
No, mum, don't worry
I don't have plans anymore

279
00:29:11,487 --> 00:29:12,966
Good night

280
00:29:15,447 --> 00:29:17,005
How old is Alia now?

281
00:29:17,447 --> 00:29:19,085
30, 31

282
00:29:29,927 --> 00:29:31,246
Kamal, Kamal

283
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:40,678
This was the first time
we saw each other in 15 years

284
00:29:49,207 --> 00:29:50,606
As if he had never left

285
00:30:00,807 --> 00:30:02,320
She looks innocent

286
00:30:02,807 --> 00:30:04,126
You think so?

287
00:30:05,647 --> 00:30:07,285
Isabelle, where's your story?

288
00:30:07,407 --> 00:30:10,240
Hello boss...

289
00:30:10,927 --> 00:30:13,361
I haven't finished it yet...

290
00:30:14,007 --> 00:30:15,486
I'm working on it the way you told me to

291
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:17,563
Don't forget to show it to me
before it goes on air

292
00:30:17,767 --> 00:30:18,802
Yes, sure

293
00:30:24,607 --> 00:30:26,359
That's his girlfriend, right?

294
00:30:30,407 --> 00:30:33,479
Besides Omar and you, all the others quit

295
00:30:34,807 --> 00:30:36,445
Why did you stay?

296
00:30:37,807 --> 00:30:39,445
Why?

297
00:30:40,847 --> 00:30:42,963
Well first of all, Alia hasn't decided yet

298
00:30:43,607 --> 00:30:46,679
And second, I like his music
and he's my friend!

299
00:30:47,287 --> 00:30:48,879
That's it?

300
00:30:49,927 --> 00:30:51,679
There's no other reason?

301
00:30:54,087 --> 00:30:58,205
- When I become a star, you'll find out
- Meaning?

302
00:30:58,327 --> 00:31:01,842
Meaning, you make us famous with
your story and then you'll see

303
00:31:03,247 --> 00:31:05,442
What if there's no story?

304
00:31:05,847 --> 00:31:07,838
Then it will remain a secret

305
00:31:20,767 --> 00:31:24,203
This 100% Lebanese company was excluded
from the Anjar festival this year

306
00:31:24,327 --> 00:31:27,125
Blasted for prejudicing
Lebanon's cultural heritage

307
00:31:35,367 --> 00:31:37,119
Molly! Molly! I am on TV!

308
00:31:38,247 --> 00:31:40,238
Of course, madam is a madam!

309
00:31:45,927 --> 00:31:49,124
They don't seem to think you're a disaster!

310
00:31:49,247 --> 00:31:51,841
I want to live with my time
not in a bygone past!

311
00:31:52,247 --> 00:31:54,158
Bygone past? Man, you're way off!

312
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:58,280
Once more, this year we did our best
to respect our traditional values

313
00:31:58,927 --> 00:32:03,955
We believe that there can be
no evolution without roots

314
00:32:05,527 --> 00:32:08,280
Alia, Alia, come see your sweetheart on TV!

315
00:32:08,807 --> 00:32:11,037
Mum! Mum! You're on TV!

316
00:32:14,527 --> 00:32:19,237
It's the Lebanese public that should decide
whether our dance is popular or not

317
00:32:19,367 --> 00:32:21,801
Not a senile jury

318
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:24,562
Thank God we have TV to tell us
What's going on in your life

319
00:32:27,047 --> 00:32:32,167
It's true I'm not all that young anymore
but this dabkeh is just amazing!

320
00:32:32,287 --> 00:32:36,200
In fact, I invited them
to dance here in Baalbeck

321
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:39,879
What, what, Baalbeck?

322
00:32:40,407 --> 00:32:43,479
He's gone mad!

323
00:32:44,527 --> 00:32:45,755
I have to call them

324
00:32:57,287 --> 00:32:58,276
Hello

325
00:33:00,727 --> 00:33:01,796
Hello

326
00:33:03,967 --> 00:33:08,199
The dancers haven't given up. And like
the Phoenix, they have dusted off the ashes

327
00:33:08,327 --> 00:33:10,795
And decided to go on a tour across
the Lebanese regions

328
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:13,919
Arze, it's for you!

329
00:33:14,047 --> 00:33:18,563
So they want to show Mr. Mahfouz Barakat
That they can go to the people

330
00:33:19,367 --> 00:33:21,403
Instead of the people coming to them!

331
00:33:22,447 --> 00:33:26,281
It will be an itinerant festival
the troupe will be dancing

332
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:28,725
In Rachaya, Baalbeck and even junieh

333
00:33:28,847 --> 00:33:30,121
That's history

334
00:33:31,967 --> 00:33:33,559
Come on, dinner's ready

335
00:33:35,287 --> 00:33:36,720
He's playing it smart all right

336
00:33:36,967 --> 00:33:38,400
What's this, can it be right?

337
00:33:38,687 --> 00:33:40,006
He's either bold or just thick

338
00:33:40,487 --> 00:33:42,079
He's a pusher, he's real slick

339
00:33:42,207 --> 00:33:45,324
No, no, no, no
If he thinks he can go on

340
00:33:45,727 --> 00:33:47,160
Doing things that can't be done

341
00:33:47,447 --> 00:33:50,519
Television, Television
I have my name to protect

342
00:33:50,967 --> 00:33:52,366
This is something I can't accept

343
00:33:52,727 --> 00:33:54,479
No, I can't. He's making fun of me

344
00:34:05,767 --> 00:34:08,076
This tune, I can't hear no more

345
00:34:08,287 --> 00:34:10,562
It's eating you to the core

346
00:34:10,727 --> 00:34:13,241
You keep singing it to me

347
00:34:13,367 --> 00:34:15,597
The world is changing, can't you see

348
00:34:16,047 --> 00:34:18,197
Stop sighing for these lost wars

349
00:34:18,367 --> 00:34:20,483
And this dabkeh that's grown sore

350
00:34:20,607 --> 00:34:23,246
This tune, I can't hear no more

351
00:34:23,367 --> 00:34:25,119
It's eating you to the core

352
00:34:25,727 --> 00:34:30,517
This tune, I can't hear no more
It's eating you to the core

353
00:34:30,767 --> 00:34:32,325
No, no, no, no

354
00:34:33,287 --> 00:34:38,122
Since the end of this damn war
You don't see your way no more

355
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:42,843
There is more than the dabkeh
That's worth living for, I say

356
00:34:43,287 --> 00:34:48,281
There is more than the dabkeh
That's worth living for, I say

357
00:34:48,567 --> 00:34:49,556
I can't

358
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:50,881
Don't want to

359
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:55,637
There's nothing you'd like more
You can't hide it anymore

360
00:34:55,767 --> 00:35:00,602
Even your daughter is dancing
To Trance, hip hop and Samba

361
00:35:00,727 --> 00:35:05,721
Even your daughter is dancing
To Trance, hip hop and Samba

362
00:35:05,847 --> 00:35:10,602
Tomorrow you'll stop your sorrow
Your friend's word you'll follow

363
00:35:10,727 --> 00:35:15,596
Lend an ear and take a cue
Take it slow and think it through

364
00:35:52,607 --> 00:35:54,484
You'll come back
tell me that you'll come back

365
00:36:18,207 --> 00:36:20,516
You know why Kamal
wants us to meet here?

366
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,280
To make us feel guilty!

367
00:36:24,567 --> 00:36:28,162
Stop it, school memories
are much harder on him

368
00:36:30,247 --> 00:36:32,078
We really fucked this place up!

369
00:36:34,927 --> 00:36:36,519
Look...

370
00:36:36,647 --> 00:36:38,956
You remember that silly game
we used to play?

371
00:36:39,287 --> 00:36:42,085
- What was it called again?
- Dodge ball

372
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:44,564
Oh yes, dodge ball

373
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:51,442
I also remember when I was on the other side
of the mountain, on the mortar

374
00:36:53,407 --> 00:36:55,125
And I was ordered to fire

375
00:37:02,607 --> 00:37:04,677
I totally screwed my childhood!

376
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:08,478
Did you see the cafeteria?

377
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:27,720
1 7 years of war, and not one bullet!
Not even a scratch!

378
00:37:28,527 --> 00:37:30,006
Number 1!

379
00:37:30,407 --> 00:37:32,682
That's the one I used to take

380
00:37:32,807 --> 00:37:35,162
This bus is blessed by the heavens

381
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:38,324
Nothing happened to it during the war

382
00:37:38,847 --> 00:37:43,443
Mister Na..m says we can do whatever
we want with it. Is that right?

383
00:37:43,567 --> 00:37:47,355
The bus belongs to the school
meaning to your father. So?

384
00:37:48,087 --> 00:37:52,285
So now this thing is supposed to take us to
Baalbek, the land of the dabkeh?

385
00:37:52,487 --> 00:37:55,285
They're going to grind us to bits
and throw us to the lions!

386
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:59,204
Why did you come then?
Katia doesn't agree, and she is not here

387
00:37:59,767 --> 00:38:01,166
What's your problem?

388
00:38:01,287 --> 00:38:04,677
If you really want to know
I don't agree either

389
00:38:05,407 --> 00:38:07,682
But I'm here for your father's sake
For the pledge we made to him

390
00:38:07,927 --> 00:38:09,804
Dancing at a wedding, that's all we needed!

391
00:38:09,967 --> 00:38:13,676
- The television will be there
- TV? Oh my!

392
00:38:14,607 --> 00:38:19,044
Isabelle, the reporter, will be doing a 2-minute
report on us every day for the evening news

393
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:25,004
It's thanks to you, you know

394
00:38:25,487 --> 00:38:28,923
I told you! Icing on the cake!

395
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:35,237
So what story did you make up
for Isabelle to get on prime time?

396
00:38:36,127 --> 00:38:41,918
The hurt, misunderstood artist
or the uprooted martyr?

397
00:38:43,047 --> 00:38:46,756
I said I know how to make pretty girls dance

398
00:38:49,087 --> 00:38:51,157
And our beauty queen here
is she still running?

399
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,845
No it can't

400
00:38:54,007 --> 00:38:58,285
But if you fill her up
she'll take you to the Indies!

401
00:38:59,287 --> 00:39:03,326
What are you planning to do
if Katia doesn't show up?

402
00:39:03,767 --> 00:39:07,123
- Can we dance without her?
- Toufic, I have the solution

403
00:39:07,247 --> 00:39:10,125
Stop worrying!

404
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:11,805
I don't believe this!

405
00:39:11,927 --> 00:39:13,758
Oh you better believe it!

406
00:39:13,887 --> 00:39:15,605
She's right. Plump dancers spice up the show

407
00:39:15,727 --> 00:39:18,400
Even Bill T. jones had overweight
dancers in his New York City show

408
00:39:18,527 --> 00:39:21,758
This is Arab City, honey, not New York City!
There is no way that Arze is going to dance

409
00:39:22,487 --> 00:39:24,717
- Why not?
- A bit of practice...

410
00:39:26,527 --> 00:39:28,165
And she'll blow us away!

411
00:39:32,527 --> 00:39:34,006
Well?

412
00:40:04,887 --> 00:40:08,277
THE ANjAR FESTIVAL
- THE AUTHENTIC RECAPTURED -

413
00:40:26,287 --> 00:40:27,515
Alia!

414
00:40:29,687 --> 00:40:33,316
- Mum, I'm not going to school!
- Home-cooked food is healthier

415
00:40:33,447 --> 00:40:36,166
Good morning Mrs...
Morning Sir...

416
00:40:36,287 --> 00:40:38,801
Oh my Lord! What is this?

417
00:40:41,367 --> 00:40:44,086
Dad, this is Kamal
Kamal Maffousse

418
00:40:44,327 --> 00:40:46,397
We were together in school, remember?

419
00:40:49,007 --> 00:40:52,682
Kamal yes, yes, of course
Do you still live in France?

420
00:40:52,807 --> 00:40:54,320
I'm back now

421
00:40:54,727 --> 00:40:57,287
I'm warning you Kamal
if anything happens to her

422
00:40:57,447 --> 00:41:00,280
Don't worry. Alia is like a sister to me

423
00:41:00,647 --> 00:41:03,764
Thanks. One brother is a handful already

424
00:41:05,847 --> 00:41:08,315
Dad, don't worry, I'll be back soon

425
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:13,476
I know she can be a pain

426
00:41:17,487 --> 00:41:19,079
Don't worry about me. Have fun

427
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:25,444
I thought she was over him

428
00:41:38,527 --> 00:41:42,315
My mum actually thinks I'm in
the mountains nursing an old woman

429
00:41:43,007 --> 00:41:45,919
You had the guts to tell them!

430
00:41:47,527 --> 00:41:49,836
Mine thinks I'm on a set with Omar Sharif

431
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:53,516
I'm dying to see their face when they see
me on TV playing the wedding entertainer

432
00:42:09,487 --> 00:42:11,523
Bye bye
Grandiose culture

433
00:42:11,647 --> 00:42:14,286
Bye bye
Crude and rotten, Bye bye

434
00:42:14,567 --> 00:42:18,355
All around pictures of chicken
Platters of food deep-frozen

435
00:42:18,487 --> 00:42:20,398
Bye bye
Bye bye

436
00:42:28,367 --> 00:42:30,358
Bye bye
Brand babes, so sexy

437
00:42:30,487 --> 00:42:32,364
'Tabbuleh in cans- Falafel-makers'
Paradise, as far as the eye can see

438
00:42:32,487 --> 00:42:34,318
We're out of here, you and me

439
00:42:34,567 --> 00:42:37,206
Thought these smiles were for me
Bye bye

440
00:42:37,527 --> 00:42:41,236
Highways of national unity
You peoples free and selfish

441
00:42:41,367 --> 00:42:45,201
Highways of national unity
You peoples free and selfish

442
00:42:45,327 --> 00:42:47,477
Bye bye, bye bye!

443
00:43:05,407 --> 00:43:08,558
RASHAYA- MOUNT HERMON

444
00:43:08,807 --> 00:43:12,880
Off Anjar is an alternative festival
that takes place across the country

445
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:16,236
So with Anjar, it's out
and with Rashaya, it's in?

446
00:43:17,247 --> 00:43:20,080
In short, it means that
we'll be dancing here in Rashaya

447
00:43:20,647 --> 00:43:23,081
And we need the keys to grandfather's
house to spend the night

448
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:26,206
Dance huh? And you're going to dance!

449
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:29,281
And you mister, are you dancing as well?

450
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:31,796
- No, but...
- Well, good for you!

451
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:34,117
I wish Omar wouldn't dance either!

452
00:43:34,247 --> 00:43:39,082
35.000 US$ to send him
to Germany to become a doctor

453
00:43:39,207 --> 00:43:41,641
Please dad, not this story again

454
00:43:41,807 --> 00:43:44,275
35.000 US$, in those days
we had to take a loan!

455
00:43:44,487 --> 00:43:48,924
Once he would get his diploma, we thought
he would pay it back double, triple even

456
00:43:49,087 --> 00:43:51,362
Dad, please!

457
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:02,520
Go on, pour him a third cup
Kamal is family!

458
00:44:03,487 --> 00:44:04,886
Thanks

459
00:44:05,287 --> 00:44:06,959
So you want the keys
to your grandfather's house?

460
00:44:07,447 --> 00:44:08,721
Yes

461
00:44:08,887 --> 00:44:10,639
So you can wiggle?

462
00:44:12,127 --> 00:44:13,116
So we can dance

463
00:44:13,407 --> 00:44:16,399
Go find yourself a hotel will you!

464
00:44:16,607 --> 00:44:17,801
Go!

465
00:44:25,687 --> 00:44:27,564
This is your grandfather's house?

466
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,361
What a shame!

467
00:44:32,567 --> 00:44:35,035
- Don't worry
- This is the last time I set foot in this house

468
00:44:44,287 --> 00:44:47,279
We had agreed to share all the expenses!

469
00:44:47,407 --> 00:44:50,319
Don't complicate things. I don't want to!

470
00:44:53,847 --> 00:44:55,405
What's going on?

471
00:44:55,807 --> 00:44:58,082
Omar's father doesn't want to take us in

472
00:44:58,247 --> 00:45:00,715
And Omar here is playing Great Gatsby

473
00:45:01,527 --> 00:45:04,087
If we can't stay at my grandfather's house
I'm going to pay for the hotel!

474
00:45:04,207 --> 00:45:06,198
It's my money, and I'm free to do
what I want with it!

475
00:45:06,327 --> 00:45:08,318
- Why are you insisting?
- You're in my village!

476
00:45:08,447 --> 00:45:12,326
And these are our traditions! Don't embarrass
me any more than I already am!

477
00:45:36,207 --> 00:45:37,481
What are you watching?

478
00:45:40,967 --> 00:45:43,276
I'm just zapping

479
00:45:51,727 --> 00:45:53,718
I'm scared about tomorrow

480
00:46:27,487 --> 00:46:29,045
I didn't know you were so popular!

481
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,639
The whole town and their mother are here!

482
00:46:33,847 --> 00:46:35,883
You really think they're here for me?

483
00:46:36,007 --> 00:46:37,804
It's the Diva they're here for!

484
00:46:45,407 --> 00:46:46,999
No, no, no!

485
00:46:47,127 --> 00:46:50,005
I've said this a million times, this only
comes at the second musical phrase!

486
00:46:50,127 --> 00:46:53,039
It's set, everyone's here! Even reporters

487
00:46:53,207 --> 00:46:55,163
But not his highness of course

488
00:46:55,287 --> 00:46:58,245
Omar, I told you he was coming

489
00:46:58,927 --> 00:47:00,883
So, how many dances are we allowed?

490
00:47:01,007 --> 00:47:01,996
Only one!

491
00:47:02,127 --> 00:47:03,799
After all, we're only appetizers
for the great Diva

492
00:47:06,727 --> 00:47:09,799
Put the electro version!

493
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:13,480
I thought you said it wouldn't work
with the mentality over here

494
00:47:13,607 --> 00:47:16,644
I didn't want to, because of my father
But since he isn't here

495
00:47:17,647 --> 00:47:19,603
Put it on, I like it better

496
00:47:34,687 --> 00:47:36,996
Kamal, we're on

497
00:47:37,607 --> 00:47:39,279
OK, I'm coming

498
00:49:50,207 --> 00:49:51,686
This is the second time!

499
00:49:51,807 --> 00:49:54,241
Baalbeck would really be the end!

500
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:56,005
Toufic, enough already

501
00:49:56,127 --> 00:50:00,837
You were very good! Not one wrong step!
Particularly you Omar, you were excellent!

502
00:50:06,447 --> 00:50:10,042
Omar, you know they are a bit conservative
here, but that doesn't mean they didn't like us!

503
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:20,762
My father didn't want me to dance
Neither did my mum

504
00:50:21,687 --> 00:50:22,722
But I did

505
00:50:24,887 --> 00:50:28,004
I struggled, but for what?

506
00:50:30,087 --> 00:50:31,566
Nothing

507
00:50:31,687 --> 00:50:34,440
What have I achieved? Zilch

508
00:50:37,807 --> 00:50:40,321
I need them! They're my family!

509
00:50:41,687 --> 00:50:44,406
At least, you stood up for your choices

510
00:50:44,527 --> 00:50:47,917
You, get off my back!
What is it to you?

511
00:50:48,567 --> 00:50:50,558
If it doesn't work
you just return to your country

512
00:50:51,127 --> 00:50:52,606
My country?

513
00:50:52,727 --> 00:50:55,764
My country is here!
I am Lebanese, just like you

514
00:50:56,687 --> 00:50:58,803
It's this country that is estranged, not me!

515
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:23,565
They're here! They're here!

516
00:52:24,367 --> 00:52:27,404
Welcome! You came from so far, just for us!

517
00:52:32,647 --> 00:52:35,081
We won't let you leave with empty stomachs

518
00:52:36,207 --> 00:52:39,517
Please feel at home
Welcome, welcome

519
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,325
I have only these flowers to offer you

520
00:52:45,567 --> 00:52:48,365
You're very generous. Thank you!

521
00:52:51,447 --> 00:52:53,119
Kamal!

522
00:52:59,127 --> 00:53:02,915
The jar is heavy, but the scent isn't

523
00:53:03,287 --> 00:53:05,403
Why don't you give these to the pretty girls

524
00:53:13,487 --> 00:53:15,000
For me?

525
00:53:16,287 --> 00:53:18,005
Are you sure?

526
00:53:21,887 --> 00:53:23,400
Welcome to Rashaya

527
00:53:26,647 --> 00:53:30,242
We're glad you're here, because
we always enjoy shows like these

528
00:53:52,327 --> 00:53:53,840
Well, well!

529
00:53:53,967 --> 00:53:56,162
Look who's here! Welcome!

530
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,835
I won't bother you

531
00:53:58,927 --> 00:54:02,158
Sprinkle some of your glory on me!

532
00:54:03,167 --> 00:54:06,239
Oh I see. You get prickly seeing
so many men around me

533
00:54:06,607 --> 00:54:09,405
Not at all. I love crowds too

534
00:54:10,487 --> 00:54:12,398
I can't help it. They're fans

535
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:14,725
Sure!

536
00:54:14,847 --> 00:54:16,917
Considering that you're so prudish

537
00:54:18,007 --> 00:54:19,963
You don't like it?

538
00:54:20,087 --> 00:54:21,645
Sure I do

539
00:54:21,807 --> 00:54:25,083
But I like it alone
without the traffic

540
00:54:28,247 --> 00:54:29,885
It's all a matter of fate

541
00:54:30,927 --> 00:54:33,316
Maybe if we had stayed together

542
00:54:33,447 --> 00:54:35,438
I'd be cooking and scrubbing right now

543
00:54:35,727 --> 00:54:37,683
It wouldn't have worked out anyway

544
00:54:38,287 --> 00:54:40,596
With the war and the roads
to your house blocked

545
00:54:41,327 --> 00:54:45,400
Oh stop it will you! You were afraid
of marrying a Christian girl that's all

546
00:54:45,687 --> 00:54:48,963
Oops! I forgot
We're not supposed to mention this...

547
00:54:49,687 --> 00:54:51,518
What about your family?

548
00:54:52,407 --> 00:54:54,523
They treated me like some low-life!

549
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:00,918
Don't get mad darling

550
00:55:01,607 --> 00:55:03,598
You made your decision

551
00:55:10,487 --> 00:55:14,196
Come on, smile
and let my splendor shine upon you!

552
00:55:31,607 --> 00:55:33,199
Toufic!

553
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:36,998
Why did we stop here?

554
00:55:37,287 --> 00:55:38,561
Get a grip darling!

555
00:55:40,927 --> 00:55:42,519
Loosen up!

556
00:55:44,647 --> 00:55:46,683
Go ahead, he's waiting!

557
00:55:48,727 --> 00:55:50,922
Can you believe it, he went mad?

558
00:55:51,087 --> 00:55:52,918
Saying that no one understood the dance

559
00:55:54,407 --> 00:55:57,080
Omar, come on, he came to see you

560
00:55:57,607 --> 00:55:59,404
You should be grateful

561
00:55:59,927 --> 00:56:02,805
I've been dancing for ten years
and he never even tried to see me

562
00:56:03,367 --> 00:56:04,959
He went too far!

563
00:56:06,087 --> 00:56:08,317
Maybe he went too far
but at least, he's still alive

564
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:11,835
Go hug him while you still can

565
00:56:40,127 --> 00:56:43,483
You should have said
that you became a dance doctor!

566
00:58:01,967 --> 00:58:03,923
Was it you singing?

567
00:58:05,687 --> 00:58:07,245
Yes, why?

568
00:58:08,407 --> 00:58:10,125
What were you singing?

569
00:58:11,527 --> 00:58:13,836
A lullaby my grandma used to sing to me

570
00:58:15,887 --> 00:58:18,799
I don't know
It just sounded familiar

571
00:58:20,927 --> 00:58:23,202
It felt strange, as if it were calling me

572
00:58:24,687 --> 00:58:26,723
But I didn't expect it to be you

573
00:58:28,327 --> 00:58:29,760
Kamal

574
00:58:29,927 --> 00:58:33,363
You're knocking at my door in the middle
of the night to talk to me about lullabies?

575
00:58:35,847 --> 00:58:37,280
What do you want?

576
00:58:45,087 --> 00:58:46,520
Nothing...

577
00:58:48,967 --> 00:58:50,685
You want to come in?

578
00:59:02,367 --> 00:59:05,757
No. Tomorrow is a hard day
You should rest

579
00:59:11,087 --> 00:59:12,964
As you wish

580
00:59:15,047 --> 00:59:16,036
Good night

581
00:59:16,847 --> 00:59:18,200
Good night

582
01:00:39,207 --> 01:00:41,198
Dad wants to check how I'm sleeping?

583
01:00:41,607 --> 01:00:42,960
On my belly!

584
01:00:46,407 --> 01:00:48,398
Mum, go baby him for a change!

585
01:00:50,367 --> 01:00:53,006
Yes mum, I told you Omar Sharif
but I could've said anything

586
01:00:53,127 --> 01:00:55,083
Because you don't care anyway!

587
01:00:56,367 --> 01:01:00,963
Yes, mum, I hear you. Everything's all right
Are you taking your medicine?

588
01:01:03,367 --> 01:01:05,961
Take care, I love you

589
01:01:12,727 --> 01:01:15,195
All we need now is another
embarrassment in Baalbeck!

590
01:01:16,967 --> 01:01:18,241
Don't worry

591
01:01:24,927 --> 01:01:28,442
This ain't really anything
It's a mix of everything

592
01:01:28,607 --> 01:01:32,077
This ain't really anything
It's a mix of everything

593
01:01:32,207 --> 01:01:35,244
It's a mix you old fool

594
01:01:35,487 --> 01:01:38,604
This is hummus, that is fast food

595
01:01:38,927 --> 01:01:41,964
It's a mix you old fool

596
01:01:42,767 --> 01:01:45,759
This is hummus, that is fast food

597
01:01:46,247 --> 01:01:52,641
This is dabkeh, ain't it neat
Dabkeh on a techno beat

598
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:59,606
This is dabkeh, ain't it neat
Dabkeh on a techno beat

599
01:02:22,807 --> 01:02:24,798
We don't have to do this

600
01:02:50,647 --> 01:02:56,483
THE 'OFF' ANjAR FESTIVAL
THE AUTHENTIC (RECAPTURED ) 'MODERNIZED'

601
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:20,165
BAALBECK

602
01:03:21,967 --> 01:03:27,121
This itinerant festival is a first in Lebanon

603
01:03:27,287 --> 01:03:30,085
Its success can be attributed
to Kamal Maffousse

604
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:32,243
A composer and choreographer

605
01:03:32,647 --> 01:03:35,798
One of the brilliant minds that lives in exile

606
01:03:35,927 --> 01:03:39,317
Who decided to leave France
and return to serve his country

607
01:03:41,367 --> 01:03:42,880
It's a bit over the top, no?

608
01:03:47,847 --> 01:03:51,556
I'm not doing this for your pretty face
It's a special request from the boss

609
01:03:53,487 --> 01:03:55,125
You see this van you're in?

610
01:03:56,767 --> 01:03:59,520
My boss only uses it for the hot news

611
01:04:00,007 --> 01:04:01,486
Meaning?!

612
01:04:03,727 --> 01:04:07,163
Your group is certainly not hot news
At most, you make a good cultural report

613
01:04:07,407 --> 01:04:09,079
But he still gave me the van

614
01:04:10,087 --> 01:04:11,520
Looks like he likes you!

615
01:04:14,967 --> 01:04:15,956
Watch this!

616
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,606
The dabkeh used to have its own heyday

617
01:04:17,807 --> 01:04:20,879
In Baalbeck, Baakline
and all those festivals

618
01:04:21,007 --> 01:04:22,963
Now the dabkeh has almost disappeared

619
01:04:23,247 --> 01:04:26,364
just like our tradition...

620
01:04:29,287 --> 01:04:32,324
The show was very nice. It's new to us

621
01:04:32,567 --> 01:04:34,762
I really liked the Dabkeh, it was really nice

622
01:04:36,847 --> 01:04:38,997
Do you feel how tense I am?

623
01:04:45,807 --> 01:04:47,286
Did you enjoy it?

624
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:53,243
I loved the edit!

625
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:05,721
During our tour, we came across
this billboard for the Anjar festival

626
01:05:05,847 --> 01:05:10,079
- Look guys, check out the pasha on TV!
- 'We asked Mr BARAKAT what he thinks...'

627
01:05:10,847 --> 01:05:15,079
These billboards are an insult to our
festival and we cannot remain silent...

628
01:05:16,407 --> 01:05:18,045
This case does not end here

629
01:05:18,167 --> 01:05:21,443
We shall sue these criminals!

630
01:05:24,607 --> 01:05:27,360
Your friend, my boss, must be very happy

631
01:05:41,927 --> 01:05:47,843
Girls, the groom says he can
only give you two bedrooms

632
01:05:48,087 --> 01:05:49,486
You need to share

633
01:05:49,607 --> 01:05:50,596
No way

634
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:56,362
Obviously. Stars like you don't share rooms

635
01:05:56,487 --> 01:05:59,479
All the better, that will spare us
the symphony of your snoring...

636
01:05:59,607 --> 01:06:01,837
Ms. Bach!...

637
01:06:26,487 --> 01:06:29,718
Good evening ladies and gentlemen
and welcome

638
01:06:30,167 --> 01:06:35,116
Tonight, we have prepared
a surprise for our newly weds

639
01:06:36,687 --> 01:06:38,837
Who are sitting here, without a clue!

640
01:06:39,127 --> 01:06:42,164
This is going to be an exceptional evening!

641
01:06:42,527 --> 01:06:44,518
We want to sing...

642
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:49,397
Dance and clap

643
01:06:49,487 --> 01:06:50,715
And we want to love each other

644
01:06:56,607 --> 01:06:59,724
Oh God, everyone knows me here!
There's no way I'm going in!

645
01:07:00,007 --> 01:07:02,999
What did you think pussy cat? You're
just a cabaret dancer now, nothing more

646
01:07:03,167 --> 01:07:05,362
If you're afraid, pray, like me

647
01:07:05,567 --> 01:07:07,922
Pray! Whom to? Your God or mine?

648
01:07:08,367 --> 01:07:11,200
Everyone prays for his own God
that way we'll have them all on our side!

649
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:12,846
Enough already Toufic!

650
01:07:13,367 --> 01:07:15,278
We were all brought up
with the same principles

651
01:07:15,407 --> 01:07:16,886
There shouldn't be any of this between us

652
01:07:17,047 --> 01:07:18,685
Fuck your school values

653
01:07:18,927 --> 01:07:22,920
Politics in this country
They feed it to us in the bottle at birth!

654
01:07:23,167 --> 01:07:25,727
Will you stop your bullshit now
We need to focus on the dancing

655
01:07:28,287 --> 01:07:32,883
Please welcome Toufic and his fellow dancers

656
01:07:34,207 --> 01:07:37,119
DIGI DABKEH!

657
01:07:39,127 --> 01:07:41,880
I swear, I can't
This is Baalbeck guys!

658
01:07:42,367 --> 01:07:47,043
You're already in too deep!
If I were you, I would just dash right in

659
01:07:48,047 --> 01:07:50,845
What if they actually like the dance?

660
01:07:51,007 --> 01:07:53,202
And you're not with us
What would your friends say then?

661
01:07:53,687 --> 01:07:54,802
No balls!

662
01:07:55,247 --> 01:07:57,477
Come on!

663
01:08:00,047 --> 01:08:01,560
Louder, Louder!

664
01:08:03,087 --> 01:08:08,480
All right, but let us first start
with the regular Dabkeh

665
01:08:09,647 --> 01:08:11,603
At least to show them
that I'm a real dabkeh dancer

666
01:08:12,287 --> 01:08:13,800
If it makes you feel better

667
01:08:20,807 --> 01:08:22,763
If it weren't for your father, Kamal

668
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:25,800
Oh jesus, Mary!

669
01:08:26,047 --> 01:08:27,526
Help us God!

670
01:08:31,367 --> 01:08:32,800
Oh Lord!

671
01:09:16,247 --> 01:09:17,760
What an ass!

672
01:11:41,367 --> 01:11:42,925
You are one bastard!

673
01:11:46,567 --> 01:11:49,684
Viva Travolta! The King of Dabkeh!

674
01:11:49,967 --> 01:11:51,958
Viva Travolta! The King of Dabkeh!

675
01:11:54,047 --> 01:11:55,446
You were incredible!

676
01:11:56,207 --> 01:11:57,435
Why did you do that?

677
01:11:57,647 --> 01:11:59,205
Didn't I do well?

678
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:01,995
No

679
01:12:03,287 --> 01:12:06,279
What are you waiting for
to carry me sweetpie?

680
01:12:12,407 --> 01:12:16,161
I talked to my boss. I told him it was great!

681
01:12:16,727 --> 01:12:18,399
He wants to add a minute to the report

682
01:12:19,367 --> 01:12:20,846
See?

683
01:12:21,047 --> 01:12:22,480
She's saying it was great

684
01:12:29,647 --> 01:12:32,320
I would like to thank all those
who are here today for this great party

685
01:12:32,447 --> 01:12:34,517
May God bless you!

686
01:12:53,847 --> 01:12:55,883
If you enjoyed the dabkeh so much

687
01:12:56,247 --> 01:13:00,684
I suggest we open our dabkeh club
that has been closed since the war

688
01:13:03,607 --> 01:13:06,360
And if our dear Toufic agrees

689
01:13:06,607 --> 01:13:10,680
We would like him to run it

690
01:13:15,487 --> 01:13:17,045
Thank you, thank you!

691
01:13:17,527 --> 01:13:20,246
This offer couldn't have come at a better time
Because I'm looking for a job anyway!

692
01:13:22,807 --> 01:13:24,559
But I need to make one thing clear

693
01:13:25,647 --> 01:13:27,046
I hate techno music

694
01:13:27,367 --> 01:13:29,722
And all these noises they call music

695
01:13:30,327 --> 01:13:32,318
It is the real dabkeh that I like...

696
01:13:32,767 --> 01:13:35,201
The dabkeh of the young man standing there!

697
01:13:37,727 --> 01:13:40,560
If you want me to repeat this mascarade
you just saw...

698
01:13:40,847 --> 01:13:43,122
Then I'm sorry, but I cannot accept the offer

699
01:13:43,367 --> 01:13:45,085
But if you want the real dabkeh...

700
01:13:45,567 --> 01:13:49,321
A school of authentic dabkeh
that comes from the heart and soul

701
01:13:49,447 --> 01:13:50,641
Then I'm your man!

702
01:13:50,807 --> 01:13:57,042
We want dabkeh! We want dabkeh!...

703
01:14:17,127 --> 01:14:19,846
- I missed you so
- So did I

704
01:14:53,527 --> 01:14:57,566
I would have liked to offer you more...

705
01:14:57,687 --> 01:14:59,120
Thank you. It's very nice!

706
01:14:59,807 --> 01:15:01,286
I'm the one to thank you!

707
01:15:01,967 --> 01:15:04,037
I was so afraid my wedding would be dull

708
01:15:04,727 --> 01:15:06,479
I love hip-hop

709
01:15:07,407 --> 01:15:08,442
I can see that

710
01:15:08,967 --> 01:15:11,003
And your husband, he likes the same things?

711
01:15:11,607 --> 01:15:14,997
I have no idea. We don't talk much
when we're together

712
01:15:16,767 --> 01:15:18,644
I think I intimidate him

713
01:15:19,207 --> 01:15:21,038
How long have you known each other?

714
01:15:21,847 --> 01:15:24,236
Not long...But he's a good person

715
01:15:35,247 --> 01:15:38,762
Sorry Toufic, I can't

716
01:15:39,007 --> 01:15:41,157
Why? Is there something wrong?

717
01:15:42,727 --> 01:15:46,925
I can't do this to your wife

718
01:15:47,287 --> 01:15:49,960
My wife? You know her?

719
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:54,283
All my life I dreamt of being her!

720
01:15:55,767 --> 01:15:57,883
It's as if I knew her in a way

721
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:01,879
Are you playing around with me?

722
01:16:02,087 --> 01:16:04,965
Toufic...

723
01:16:06,927 --> 01:16:09,122
If we sleep together...

724
01:16:10,287 --> 01:16:12,278
You'll be like all the others

725
01:16:16,407 --> 01:16:18,443
You'll leave your wife and daughter

726
01:16:20,727 --> 01:16:22,797
And you'll become like a toy in my hands

727
01:16:25,887 --> 01:16:28,481
Then I'll dump you like an old shoe

728
01:16:35,287 --> 01:16:37,403
I don't want to do this to your daughter

729
01:16:41,327 --> 01:16:44,524
I don't want her to be hurt
like I was when I was a kid

730
01:16:46,407 --> 01:16:48,523
Because of a bitch

731
01:16:49,927 --> 01:16:51,963
And you, how many children do you have?

732
01:16:52,767 --> 01:16:54,644
Let me find the husband first!

733
01:16:55,247 --> 01:16:56,965
But, how old are you?

734
01:16:58,407 --> 01:17:00,159
A little over 30

735
01:17:01,607 --> 01:17:03,006
There haven't been any suitors?

736
01:17:04,567 --> 01:17:07,081
No, there have been many

737
01:17:07,887 --> 01:17:09,320
But I guess I...

738
01:17:11,007 --> 01:17:13,601
I just waited too long for prince charming

739
01:17:29,047 --> 01:17:31,481
Will you wait for me?

740
01:17:40,887 --> 01:17:43,321
Don't worry, I'm here

741
01:18:01,407 --> 01:18:03,637
It feels so good!

742
01:18:04,647 --> 01:18:06,558
Did you sleep well?

743
01:18:06,687 --> 01:18:08,006
Not a wink. You?

744
01:18:09,127 --> 01:18:11,687
Same here. The beds are expired!

745
01:18:11,807 --> 01:18:15,800
I can't resist the smell of butter
in the morning

746
01:18:16,407 --> 01:18:17,886
Oh, you're so kind!

747
01:18:18,207 --> 01:18:20,926
I'm not so sure you deserve this

748
01:18:26,447 --> 01:18:29,564
So, who's the best dancer?

749
01:18:29,727 --> 01:18:31,558
You are! The best dancer of all!

750
01:18:32,327 --> 01:18:35,080
- And who's the most generous of us all?
- You are!

751
01:18:37,807 --> 01:18:40,082
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

752
01:18:40,327 --> 01:18:43,046
You are stuffing yourselves
while I prepare a knefeh for you!

753
01:18:44,447 --> 01:18:46,244
Come on guys, let's eat!

754
01:18:49,647 --> 01:18:50,796
Hand me a plate

755
01:18:55,647 --> 01:18:57,000
Hand me the syrup

756
01:19:02,567 --> 01:19:05,206
What are you doing?
What about morning practice?

757
01:19:06,407 --> 01:19:09,479
Why don't you relax for a change? join us!

758
01:19:09,687 --> 01:19:13,282
You're going to need five days
to be able to dance after this

759
01:19:15,687 --> 01:19:17,803
Come on. Come sit next to me

760
01:19:17,927 --> 01:19:19,599
And enjoy this knefeh

761
01:19:21,007 --> 01:19:23,919
How come we're still taking orders from you?

762
01:19:26,327 --> 01:19:29,876
If you think you can stop dancing just because
you got a couple of claps yesterday, you're wrong

763
01:19:33,087 --> 01:19:35,601
We need to make Mr. Barakat
be sorry for what he said

764
01:19:37,367 --> 01:19:38,959
Is there something wrong?

765
01:19:40,407 --> 01:19:42,841
Bless your soul! Are you ever wrong?

766
01:19:45,527 --> 01:19:46,721
Come on Kamal!

767
01:19:47,087 --> 01:19:51,877
How could we
Let heaven slip away

768
01:19:52,007 --> 01:19:57,035
The Knefeh: a gift from God
So relax and do as we say

769
01:19:57,207 --> 01:20:02,406
Won't you quit shaking your head
You're not eating cheese and bread

770
01:20:02,527 --> 01:20:07,647
It's a blessed meal you're eating
Like a secret passion or lust

771
01:20:07,767 --> 01:20:12,795
What's hidden, you need to feel
You can't touch it, it's unreal

772
01:20:12,927 --> 01:20:18,047
The Knefeh: a gift from God
Relax my friend, and do as we say

773
01:20:18,167 --> 01:20:19,441
Eat up!

774
01:20:22,447 --> 01:20:24,119
Rule number 1:
Dabkeh dancers must form a circle

775
01:20:24,287 --> 01:20:28,963
Dabkeh should be hand in hand
The first one in line meets the last

776
01:20:29,487 --> 01:20:31,682
Here, there is no first nor last

777
01:20:31,807 --> 01:20:33,877
What does this mean?
They are just jumping

778
01:20:34,447 --> 01:20:36,438
This is no Dabkeh!

779
01:20:36,767 --> 01:20:38,439
We invented this legacy!

780
01:20:42,807 --> 01:20:47,881
Today we're here in your town
Dancing dabkeh all around

781
01:20:48,007 --> 01:20:51,522
Your town, your pride, your mark, your land
So don't trade in

782
01:20:51,647 --> 01:20:54,878
Coz you got it all here
Here, come see what you have

783
01:20:55,007 --> 01:20:59,398
Coz this sure is the place to be
So won't you please quit being down

784
01:20:59,527 --> 01:21:02,087
just see what's going all around

785
01:21:06,687 --> 01:21:09,076
Come here see what you've got

786
01:21:09,207 --> 01:21:11,118
Ain't no secrets, ain't no Anjar
Ain't no fuss

787
01:21:11,247 --> 01:21:13,886
If you want
We have no problem if you go

788
01:21:14,007 --> 01:21:18,125
Now throw your tie far from here

789
01:21:18,247 --> 01:21:22,763
Get focused and ready
Keen and intense

790
01:21:22,887 --> 01:21:27,677
For the party
At the Utopia College of Aley

791
01:21:27,807 --> 01:21:31,083
A big group will be dancing the dabkeh
A group that has style

792
01:21:31,207 --> 01:21:34,722
Strange a bit, but real cool
At the college of Aley

793
01:21:52,647 --> 01:21:54,160
You men are lucky!

794
01:21:59,087 --> 01:22:00,884
This country is blessed by God!

795
01:22:01,527 --> 01:22:04,599
Blessed by God and ruined by its people!

796
01:22:05,487 --> 01:22:07,000
Ruined by its people?

797
01:22:07,447 --> 01:22:09,802
We are its people
You and me

798
01:22:12,927 --> 01:22:15,964
What's this about dancing at the school?

799
01:22:17,127 --> 01:22:18,924
Are we back to the same old story?

800
01:22:28,847 --> 01:22:31,077
Our heritage is under threat!

801
01:22:33,647 --> 01:22:37,560
Don't live in caves
See my belly, see

802
01:22:38,207 --> 01:22:42,166
Don't live in caves
See my belly, see

803
01:22:43,047 --> 01:22:47,040
Watch how it sways
Come dance with me

804
01:22:47,647 --> 01:22:51,686
Vola's in town
Move closer, move

805
01:22:52,367 --> 01:22:56,201
Better than on screen
A quick dance to go

806
01:22:56,927 --> 01:23:00,920
Better than on screen
A quick dance to go

807
01:23:01,687 --> 01:23:05,726
Don't live in caves
See my belly, see

808
01:23:06,367 --> 01:23:10,519
Don't live in caves
See my belly, see

809
01:23:50,887 --> 01:23:54,197
Did you know about the show at the school?

810
01:23:54,927 --> 01:23:55,996
No more than you!

811
01:23:58,607 --> 01:24:00,916
Did it come to you just like that
like a revelation?

812
01:24:02,167 --> 01:24:04,965
Mr Mahfouz is starting to feel the itch

813
01:24:05,167 --> 01:24:06,998
And we have to make him eat his heart out

814
01:24:07,127 --> 01:24:09,038
By taking us back to the cafeteria

815
01:24:09,247 --> 01:24:11,158
And hitting on the sensitive nerve!

816
01:24:11,287 --> 01:24:12,561
That's blackmail, Kamal

817
01:24:12,647 --> 01:24:14,478
We need to come full circle

818
01:24:15,847 --> 01:24:17,326
Listen Kamal!

819
01:24:17,447 --> 01:24:20,598
I dance to forget my pain

820
01:24:21,927 --> 01:24:23,645
I can't keep reopening the wound

821
01:24:24,967 --> 01:24:27,481
Stop playing with your nightmares, Kamal!

822
01:24:27,807 --> 01:24:30,082
Don't you see that it is hard on us too?

823
01:24:30,207 --> 01:24:32,084
We haven't forgotten either

824
01:24:32,207 --> 01:24:34,118
No one can forget!

825
01:24:35,087 --> 01:24:39,126
The thing is we just gave in
End of story

826
01:24:40,487 --> 01:24:42,876
Oh Oh! there's trouble

827
01:24:48,327 --> 01:24:49,396
Move over!

828
01:24:49,527 --> 01:24:52,166
- Good morning
- Move over I said!

829
01:24:55,287 --> 01:24:57,482
Stop the car on the right

830
01:24:58,807 --> 01:24:59,956
Prepare your camera

831
01:25:01,727 --> 01:25:03,718
Your story doesn't make any sense

832
01:25:04,647 --> 01:25:06,797
A bus from 1943 and you want me

833
01:25:07,007 --> 01:25:08,759
To believe that it's in order?

834
01:25:08,927 --> 01:25:10,599
Please...

835
01:25:10,727 --> 01:25:12,558
Not once did I pay the license tag late

836
01:25:12,687 --> 01:25:15,201
Even when the bombs were pouring down!

837
01:25:15,647 --> 01:25:17,205
It says here that it's blue!

838
01:25:18,087 --> 01:25:19,520
But this is a blue touch!

839
01:25:21,967 --> 01:25:23,446
Have you found anything?

840
01:25:24,007 --> 01:25:26,202
Nothing so far, sir

841
01:25:27,607 --> 01:25:29,086
Captain...

842
01:25:29,687 --> 01:25:32,485
My name is Khalil Daoud
I have this letter from the Minister...

843
01:25:32,607 --> 01:25:34,120
Pursue the search!

844
01:25:34,447 --> 01:25:35,800
Come on...

845
01:25:38,327 --> 01:25:40,045
Throw the bags!

846
01:25:41,887 --> 01:25:44,560
I'm telling you boss
they are all being held at the checkpoint

847
01:25:46,167 --> 01:25:48,965
- Get yourself arrested
- Arrested, me and the cameraman!?

848
01:25:49,127 --> 01:25:51,516
Of course, film everything, everything you hear

849
01:25:51,687 --> 01:25:54,997
And try to be on your worst behavior

850
01:25:55,127 --> 01:25:57,118
But you realize that if they get arrested...

851
01:25:57,247 --> 01:26:00,796
I don't need to hear your explanations!

852
01:26:01,007 --> 01:26:03,237
just listen to what I'm telling you

853
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:05,642
And do exactly as I say

854
01:26:07,007 --> 01:26:10,966
If they arrest one of your clowns
I can't do anything

855
01:26:11,447 --> 01:26:14,803
But if they arrest a member of my team

856
01:26:16,047 --> 01:26:18,766
I can bring hell down on them!

857
01:26:21,887 --> 01:26:25,004
There's nothing sir
No spray cans, no paint bombs

858
01:26:43,447 --> 01:26:45,517
It's for you, Captain

859
01:26:48,367 --> 01:26:50,801
Go ahead. You have nothing to lose!

860
01:27:04,247 --> 01:27:06,442
Hello, yes?

861
01:27:07,767 --> 01:27:09,280
Yes sir

862
01:27:10,047 --> 01:27:11,446
Yes sir

863
01:27:12,047 --> 01:27:14,322
One minute and we'll be free!

864
01:27:15,847 --> 01:27:17,360
Yes...

865
01:27:18,247 --> 01:27:20,477
But Colonel Assaad told me...

866
01:27:25,647 --> 01:27:27,205
Yes sir

867
01:27:29,407 --> 01:27:31,762
I am so grateful!

868
01:27:32,407 --> 01:27:35,205
You still don't know the real value
of Isabelle Morcos!

869
01:27:36,327 --> 01:27:37,680
Yes Sir

870
01:27:48,607 --> 01:27:50,120
As you say, sir

871
01:27:57,007 --> 01:27:58,565
What a country!

872
01:28:10,167 --> 01:28:12,078
Our savior Isabelle!

873
01:28:37,527 --> 01:28:39,438
Stop here please

874
01:28:45,287 --> 01:28:47,198
I'm leaving before I start hating you

875
01:28:48,847 --> 01:28:49,836
Alia!

876
01:28:50,807 --> 01:28:53,082
I said, go!

877
01:29:51,967 --> 01:29:56,006
This girl:
Trapped in her worries

878
01:29:56,287 --> 01:30:00,041
Wakes from a dream

879
01:30:00,567 --> 01:30:04,845
To find her past constantly reset

880
01:30:05,447 --> 01:30:07,517
She must move on

881
01:30:07,647 --> 01:30:09,877
But can't let go

882
01:30:10,367 --> 01:30:12,722
She must move on

883
01:30:12,847 --> 01:30:17,762
But can't let go

884
01:30:19,007 --> 01:30:23,159
Where do you come from my friend, where?

885
01:30:23,327 --> 01:30:27,525
Where are you heading, where?

886
01:30:28,127 --> 01:30:33,565
My heart betrayed, I drift away

887
01:30:34,607 --> 01:30:40,364
The face I loved, erased

888
01:30:41,327 --> 01:30:45,161
Where do you come from my friend, where?

889
01:30:45,287 --> 01:30:49,405
Where are you heading, where?

890
01:30:49,847 --> 01:30:55,797
My hair is now long
But your voice is weak

891
01:30:56,567 --> 01:31:02,437
My heart is in pain
And won't heal

892
01:31:03,127 --> 01:31:07,120
Where do you come from my friend, where?

893
01:31:07,247 --> 01:31:11,638
Where are you heading, where?

894
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:17,917
Can you learn to let go
Of the weighted past?

895
01:31:18,487 --> 01:31:24,517
Learn to love after the pain?

896
01:31:25,807 --> 01:31:31,723
I can't find my path
I've strayed too far

897
01:31:32,447 --> 01:31:38,238
Longing for the past, lost to time

898
01:31:39,007 --> 01:31:44,957
The image I had of you was so strong

899
01:31:45,647 --> 01:31:51,244
Now it fades and your voice has gone

900
01:32:01,007 --> 01:32:04,363
jUNIEH

901
01:32:21,207 --> 01:32:24,438
That is all that is left
of our beautiful sand beaches

902
01:32:26,647 --> 01:32:28,205
That is all that is left

903
01:32:30,207 --> 01:32:33,279
What do you want to do Kamal?
We can't dance without Alia

904
01:32:33,767 --> 01:32:35,359
Vola will replace her

905
01:32:35,487 --> 01:32:37,762
No way! There is no way I can replace her

906
01:32:38,407 --> 01:32:41,956
I'm already out of place!

907
01:32:42,487 --> 01:32:46,036
Without Alia
You can't do anything

908
01:32:47,487 --> 01:32:50,445
Katia left, and now Alia
There's no troupe anymore

909
01:32:51,727 --> 01:32:53,558
What are you saying?
You want to cancel?

910
01:32:53,727 --> 01:32:57,117
OK, Go say this to Khalil's uncle
who opened the place just for us

911
01:32:57,247 --> 01:32:58,521
Go say this to his folks

912
01:32:59,447 --> 01:33:01,119
All of junieh is here to see him dance!

913
01:33:01,967 --> 01:33:04,481
Our relatives have seen us dance
and that's what counts

914
01:33:10,727 --> 01:33:12,399
You know I can do it

915
01:33:14,527 --> 01:33:16,597
You know what that means?

916
01:33:17,967 --> 01:33:20,003
Anyway I've always wanted them to know

917
01:33:20,447 --> 01:33:22,642
Now I'm giving them a chance to applaud

918
01:33:25,887 --> 01:33:28,037
I am sure it will be all right

919
01:33:40,527 --> 01:33:43,439
WELCOME TO THE ''OFF'' TROUPE:
THE DIGI DABKEH

920
01:34:42,607 --> 01:34:44,996
You deserve every clap you got

921
01:34:45,647 --> 01:34:47,444
It's all thanks to you

922
01:34:56,567 --> 01:34:58,478
I've got great news for you

923
01:34:59,607 --> 01:35:02,485
The jury's president Mahfouz Barakat finally...

924
01:35:03,407 --> 01:35:05,682
Agreed to let you participate in the contest

925
01:35:07,287 --> 01:35:09,278
Anjar is opening its doors to the DIGI Dabkeh!

926
01:35:09,407 --> 01:35:11,159
- My boss just told me
- Really?!

927
01:35:11,287 --> 01:35:12,276
Finally!

928
01:35:13,207 --> 01:35:15,846
Come over here
Tell me, your boss, can't we meet him?

929
01:35:16,167 --> 01:35:17,919
I'm sorry, I don't get it

930
01:35:18,247 --> 01:35:20,477
What made Mr. Barakat change his mind?

931
01:35:21,167 --> 01:35:24,637
Kamal, it's all about money
between Barakat and my boss

932
01:35:25,207 --> 01:35:28,563
Our network always had an exclusive
to broadcast the Anjar festival

933
01:35:29,007 --> 01:35:31,646
But these days
Mr. Barakat set the price too high

934
01:35:32,007 --> 01:35:35,079
So let's say your tour
was a way of putting some heat on him

935
01:35:36,327 --> 01:35:39,842
So we were just an excuse
to get a better rate?

936
01:35:40,167 --> 01:35:43,000
What's it to you? What matters is
that we're finally going to dance

937
01:35:43,127 --> 01:35:46,244
Why don't you go get Alia
instead of asking stupid questions!

938
01:35:47,127 --> 01:35:51,006
No, I'm glad, but if I get this right
You were playing us from the very beginning?

939
01:35:52,127 --> 01:35:54,846
Don't be so dramatic!

940
01:35:55,127 --> 01:35:56,924
It's business, that's all

941
01:35:57,047 --> 01:35:59,845
They had to fill up the grid and they did

942
01:36:00,127 --> 01:36:01,446
And you don't give a damn about our dabkeh!

943
01:36:02,567 --> 01:36:04,285
No my dear, I won't accept it!

944
01:36:05,007 --> 01:36:06,281
What do you mean?

945
01:36:07,527 --> 01:36:10,917
Kamal, I really don't understand you
I thought you would be happy

946
01:36:11,287 --> 01:36:14,597
Wouldn't you rather be in Anjar aired
on TV and seen by the entire country...

947
01:36:14,727 --> 01:36:16,797
Than dance in ruins before
a couple of people?

948
01:36:16,927 --> 01:36:19,964
You're right. But we would rather dance in
ruins infront of a couple of people as you say

949
01:36:20,687 --> 01:36:21,836
This is ridiculous!

950
01:36:22,487 --> 01:36:24,159
You don't get it, do you?

951
01:36:25,647 --> 01:36:28,207
The off is more important than the in

952
01:36:28,367 --> 01:36:31,120
It's better to be out than in

953
01:36:31,927 --> 01:36:35,203
The greatest revolutions happened from
outside. Nothing happened from inside

954
01:36:36,127 --> 01:36:37,799
What revolutions are you talking about?

955
01:36:38,247 --> 01:36:40,158
Even if you're right

956
01:36:40,767 --> 01:36:43,440
We have no choice but to go on, together

957
01:36:44,207 --> 01:36:47,722
Listen Kamal Mafousse, Vola Andraos
is dancing at the Anjar festival

958
01:36:47,847 --> 01:36:50,441
Whether you like it or not
And anyone who loves me, will follow me!

959
01:36:52,687 --> 01:36:55,599
I don't understand you anymore Kamal

960
01:37:11,287 --> 01:37:13,084
Kamal, what are you doing?

961
01:37:14,447 --> 01:37:18,235
You get what you want and you check out?

962
01:37:19,007 --> 01:37:20,520
Congratulations

963
01:37:20,647 --> 01:37:22,205
You played us perfectly!

964
01:37:22,327 --> 01:37:24,557
I tried warning you Kamal

965
01:37:27,167 --> 01:37:28,964
But you were...

966
01:37:29,367 --> 01:37:31,597
Too self-absorbed to listen

967
01:37:33,727 --> 01:37:37,163
Well anyway, thanks, really

968
01:37:38,887 --> 01:37:40,878
That's all you have to say to me?

969
01:37:46,167 --> 01:37:47,998
You too, you want to go with them?

970
01:37:48,527 --> 01:37:50,119
Where shall I take you?

971
01:38:25,687 --> 01:38:28,155
I thought you were asleep

972
01:38:30,087 --> 01:38:31,202
No

973
01:38:32,047 --> 01:38:33,480
Where are we going?

974
01:38:34,167 --> 01:38:36,965
You said drive, so I did

975
01:38:37,527 --> 01:38:39,358
Here you go, I'll stop

976
01:38:50,847 --> 01:38:52,485
What have I done?

977
01:38:53,367 --> 01:38:56,086
All I wanted was to bring them
back together around the same tune

978
01:38:56,647 --> 01:38:58,922
A music, that would help us bury
all the dead things in us

979
01:38:59,047 --> 01:39:01,356
It turns out I am unable to bury anything!

980
01:39:05,727 --> 01:39:07,319
And here I am

981
01:39:08,367 --> 01:39:11,723
Like a fool, being driven in a bus

982
01:39:13,927 --> 01:39:15,963
I wish I were outside all this

983
01:39:18,327 --> 01:39:20,477
I wish I could go far, but where to?

984
01:39:21,127 --> 01:39:23,516
Out far, it is void, there is nothing

985
01:39:24,207 --> 01:39:25,560
Nothing

986
01:39:34,727 --> 01:39:37,799
This bus was nothing before you returned

987
01:39:37,927 --> 01:39:40,646
But nothing is everything

988
01:39:41,287 --> 01:39:44,279
What would have happened to it
If we had left it?

989
01:39:44,447 --> 01:39:47,120
Nothing
A blank page

990
01:39:47,407 --> 01:39:50,205
Nothing is everything!

991
01:39:51,087 --> 01:39:53,282
You knew my father well

992
01:39:53,607 --> 01:39:55,677
What would he have done in my place?

993
01:39:56,327 --> 01:39:58,477
You should ask yourself that question!

994
01:40:09,887 --> 01:40:11,400
Go on Kamal

995
01:40:12,327 --> 01:40:14,283
The cafeteria is right there

996
01:40:14,727 --> 01:40:16,206
Go in, ask him

997
01:40:58,847 --> 01:41:00,485
You are making fun?

998
01:41:02,287 --> 01:41:04,642
I promise I will show you!

999
01:41:50,807 --> 01:41:53,002
There's no way to know in a country like this

1000
01:41:53,247 --> 01:41:56,319
It is all of us and yet non of us was in it

1001
01:41:57,647 --> 01:42:00,923
They even handed weapons to children

1002
01:42:02,047 --> 01:42:04,356
They didn't want anyone to understand

1003
01:42:05,007 --> 01:42:08,044
They abolished thinking

1004
01:42:11,327 --> 01:42:13,557
So, do you want that coffee or not?

1005
01:42:16,367 --> 01:42:17,595
Yes

1006
01:42:18,367 --> 01:42:19,595
Come

1007
01:43:10,647 --> 01:43:12,365
If I come back

1008
01:43:13,487 --> 01:43:15,284
It'll be for you

1009
01:43:22,087 --> 01:43:23,076
Yes...

1010
01:43:26,367 --> 01:43:28,358
What, you came to see if I'm singing

1011
01:43:28,527 --> 01:43:30,916
Or if I'm dancing...
for you?

1012
01:43:32,407 --> 01:43:34,284
Or did you come to say good night?

1013
01:43:35,607 --> 01:43:37,677
I'm not dancing and I'm not singing

1014
01:43:39,007 --> 01:43:40,645
Neither have I been sleeping

1015
01:43:56,527 --> 01:43:57,960
Kamal

1016
01:44:01,527 --> 01:44:03,757
You come and go and you're still
in the same place

1017
01:44:07,207 --> 01:44:11,120
We all tried helping you get over your father's
death, but you're not willing to

1018
01:44:11,527 --> 01:44:13,199
Alia, I understand

1019
01:44:16,527 --> 01:44:19,564
But, I can't take seeing you

1020
01:44:20,567 --> 01:44:23,286
Sad and hurt anymore

1021
01:44:34,967 --> 01:44:36,764
And I keep missing you

1022
01:44:57,767 --> 01:44:59,405
This is a music I've been working on lately

1023
01:44:59,527 --> 01:45:01,006
It's not techno, nor dabkeh

1024
01:45:02,327 --> 01:45:03,999
It's a Lebanese mix!

1025
01:45:04,207 --> 01:45:06,118
He won't stop, will he!

1026
01:45:06,327 --> 01:45:07,885
It's a five

1027
01:45:08,007 --> 01:45:10,043
Not a 6 and not a 4

1028
01:45:10,247 --> 01:45:12,238
It's a new beat that we did

1029
01:45:17,727 --> 01:45:20,241
1, 2, 3, 4 and 5

1030
01:45:28,527 --> 01:45:29,926
Do that again, will you?

1031
01:45:32,207 --> 01:45:34,596
Unbelievable!
He doesn't limp when he dances!

1032
01:45:34,727 --> 01:45:36,319
You can dance!

1033
01:45:36,807 --> 01:45:39,002
Maybe if he does, he'll quit harassing us!

1034
01:45:40,807 --> 01:45:42,559
Not in your wildest dreams!

1035
01:45:43,127 --> 01:45:46,676
Seriously Kamal, show us again

1036
01:46:27,247 --> 01:46:29,203
CNBS Presents

1037
01:46:31,167 --> 01:46:33,965
The National Dabkeh Festival Of Anjar

1038
01:46:34,087 --> 01:46:36,920
We live in an era driven
by a race for evolution

1039
01:46:37,447 --> 01:46:42,475
Arrogance and vanity are the prevailing traits

1040
01:46:42,847 --> 01:46:47,921
The new generation will tread
the same path we took:

1041
01:46:48,327 --> 01:46:52,923
Everything they feel passionate about today

1042
01:46:53,247 --> 01:46:58,765
Will be discarded by the next generation

1043
01:46:59,207 --> 01:47:05,680
Objects of our own desire could
well become objects of disgust

1044
01:47:05,807 --> 01:47:07,286
