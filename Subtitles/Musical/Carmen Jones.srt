Sorry.
You're a prisoner.

You mean to say you're really
gonna take me to jail?

You won't be in

A minute's too long

Uh-uh.

That's no way
to get to Masonville.

376
00:22:15,018 --> 00:22:18,954
I'd like to see the road
that can stop this baby.

you'd turn right around

the railroad crossing,

Prisoners...halt!

546
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:34,933
Left face!

547
00:32:35,001 --> 00:32:37,128
OK, sit down.

548
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,308
Joe, honey,

549
00:32:52,385 --> 00:32:55,320
I thought I'd never
see you again.

550
00:32:55,388 --> 00:32:59,791
I tried,
and I asked...

551
00:32:59,859 --> 00:33:01,827
They don't allow
no visitors

552
00:33:01,894 --> 00:33:04,454
the first two weeks
in the stockade.

553
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:06,964
I'm sorry,
carryin' on like this.

554
00:33:07,033 --> 00:33:09,593
I made myself promise
I wouldn't.

555
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:11,000
That's all right, Cindy.

556
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,628
How you been?

557
00:33:12,705 --> 00:33:14,195
Waitin'.

558
00:33:14,273 --> 00:33:16,434
Just waitin'
to see you.

559
00:33:19,011 --> 00:33:20,979
Won't help none,
you hangin' around.

560
00:33:21,047 --> 00:33:22,639
Go home to your ma.

561
00:33:22,715 --> 00:33:24,615
You want me to?

562
00:33:24,684 --> 00:33:27,619
I was just thinkin'
of you, Cindy.

563
00:33:27,687 --> 00:33:29,621
Home's where you is,
Joe.

564
00:33:31,691 --> 00:33:33,556
Are you all right,
honey?

565
00:33:33,626 --> 00:33:35,218
How are they
treatin' you?

566
00:33:35,294 --> 00:33:36,386
Fine, fine.

567
00:33:36,462 --> 00:33:38,657
When you think
you'll get out?

568
00:33:38,731 --> 00:33:40,323
Can't tell.

569
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,391
They'll still send you
to air school.

570
00:33:43,469 --> 00:33:44,629
You'll see.

571
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:46,069
Truth is, Cindy--

572
00:33:46,138 --> 00:33:48,197
I know.
Sergeant Brown told me.

573
00:33:48,274 --> 00:33:49,639
But it don't
matter none.

574
00:33:49,709 --> 00:33:51,199
I know you,Joe.

575
00:33:51,277 --> 00:33:53,575
I know you're all done
with that gal.

576
00:33:53,646 --> 00:33:55,637
Here,Joe.
Package for you.

577
00:33:55,715 --> 00:33:57,580
Must be from my mom.

578
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:01,177
I wrote her to bake
something nice for you.

579
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:17,255
Time's up.

580
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:18,653
Prisoners,
fall in.

581
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:25,218
Left face.

582
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:27,629
Forward...
march.

583
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:37,470
Chow call.
Come and get it.

584
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:14,845
This flower that you
threw my way

585
00:35:14,913 --> 00:35:22,547
Has been my friend
by night and day

586
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:30,289
I saw it fade
and lose its bloom

587
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:39,395
But still it kept
a sweet perfume

588
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:46,400
In my cell, through
every darkened hour

589
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:53,975
On my lonely eyes
lay this flower

590
00:35:54,052 --> 00:36:01,549
And so I'd sleep
the whole night through

591
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:06,654
And dream of you

592
00:36:06,732 --> 00:36:12,671
And dream of you

593
00:36:12,738 --> 00:36:19,667
Then I'd wake up
with no one near me

594
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:27,208
And talk for
the jail walls to hear me

595
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:30,254
She ain't the best

596
00:36:30,322 --> 00:36:33,587
They all the same

597
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:37,924
Like all the rest

598
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:43,024
She's just a dame

599
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:49,040
Then I told myself
I was ravin'

600
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:53,806
There was just one thing
I was cravin'

601
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:56,404
It wasn't food

602
00:36:56,481 --> 00:37:01,612
It wasn't dough,
I guess you know

603
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:04,780
That it was you

604
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:12,422
You're
all I'll ever crave

605
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:17,992
And that's for true

606
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:26,169
I don't know anything
about you

607
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:33,946
I don't know much
about a shinin' star

608
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:41,983
Just know the world
is dark without you

609
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:48,465
That's all I know

610
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:55,632
I only want you
as you are

611
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:01,173
Carmen

612
00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:11,019
I love

613
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:20,396
You

614
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,185
Thanks for the lift,
big oil man.

615
00:38:51,263 --> 00:38:52,594
Goin' as far as New Orleans

616
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,599
if you want to help
the war effort, baby.

617
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,567
I got
my battle station.

618
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,220
Anybody here
ask for me?

619
00:39:24,296 --> 00:39:26,127
The whole army,
that's all.

620
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,186
Hi, Carmen.

621
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:29,597
Hi. You know
who I mean.

622
00:39:29,668 --> 00:39:32,535
No corporal by
the name ofJoe.

- Go, Mack!

629
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:11,441
I'll tell you
why I wanna dance

630
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:14,444
It ain't the sweetness
in the music

631
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:17,276
I like the sweetness
in the music

632
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:20,614
Hmm, but that ain't why
I wanna dance

633
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:26,116
It's somethin' thumpin'
in the bass

634
00:40:26,191 --> 00:40:28,853
That thump-thump-thumpin'
on the music

635
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,418
That bump-bump-bumpin'
on the music

636
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:35,523
Is all I need
to start me off

637
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,228
I don't need
nothin' else

638
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:39,634
Maybe I do

639
00:40:39,704 --> 00:40:42,002
To start

640
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:44,234
Me off

641
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:46,834
Beat out that rhythm
on a drum

642
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:49,903
Beat out that rhythm
on a drum

643
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:52,609
Beat out that rhythm
on a drum

644
00:40:52,684 --> 00:40:55,448
And I don't
need no tune at all

645
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,489
Beat me that rhythm
on a drum

646
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:01,457
Beat me that rhythm
on a drum

647
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:03,960
Beat me that rhythm
on a drum

648
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:12,937
And I don't
need no tune at all

649
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:15,302
I feel it beatin'
in my bones

650
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:17,967
It feel like
2O million tom-toms

651
00:41:18,043 --> 00:41:20,773
I know there's
2O million tom-toms

652
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:23,507
Beatin' way down deep
inside my bones

653
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,680
I feel it beatin'
in my heart

654
00:41:28,753 --> 00:41:31,688
And then I get
a kind of dream

655
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:33,849
And in my dream
it kind of seems

656
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:37,691
There's one big heart
in all the world

657
00:41:37,762 --> 00:41:40,731
There ain't
but one big heart

658
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,299
One heart

659
00:41:43,368 --> 00:41:46,735
In all the world

660
00:41:46,805 --> 00:41:49,467
Beat out that rhythm
on a drum

661
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:52,135
Beat out that rhythm
on a drum

662
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,678
Beat out that rhythm
on a drum

663
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:57,579
There's one big heart
in all the world

664
00:41:57,649 --> 00:42:00,243
Beat out that rhythm
on a drum

665
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:02,650
Beat out that rhythm
on a drum

666
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:05,485
Beat out that rhythm
on a drum

667
00:42:05,557 --> 00:42:13,561
There's one big heart
in all the world

668
00:42:13,695 --> 00:42:15,993
And now that heart
is beatin' fast

669
00:42:16,064 --> 00:42:18,794
And that's a rhythm
I can dance to

670
00:42:18,866 --> 00:42:21,130
I'm mighty glad
I got a chance to

671
00:42:21,202 --> 00:42:23,932
With that one big heart
that's beatin' fast

672
00:42:26,307 --> 00:42:28,741
Tomorrow mornin'
let it rain

673
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:31,506
Tomorrow mornin'
let it pour

674
00:42:31,579 --> 00:42:34,912
Tonight we
in the groove together

675
00:42:34,982 --> 00:42:41,581
Ain't gonna worry
about stormy weather

676
00:42:41,656 --> 00:42:44,625
Gonna kick old trouble

677
00:42:44,692 --> 00:42:47,820
Out the door

678
00:42:47,895 --> 00:42:50,693
Beat out that trouble
on a drum

679
00:42:50,765 --> 00:42:53,427
Beat out old trouble
on a drum

680
00:42:53,501 --> 00:42:55,765
Beat out old trouble
on a drum

681
00:42:55,837 --> 00:42:58,499
And kick his carcass
out the door

682
00:42:58,573 --> 00:43:01,303
Beat me that rhythm
on a drum

683
00:43:01,375 --> 00:43:03,707
Beat me that rhythm
on a drum

684
00:43:03,778 --> 00:43:06,110
Beat me that rhythm
on a drum

685
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,307
And kick old trouble
out the door

686
00:43:08,382 --> 00:43:10,714
Kick him out the door,
kick him out the door

687
00:43:10,785 --> 00:43:15,813
Kick him out the door,
kick him out the door

688
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,891
Charlie,

689
00:43:27,969 --> 00:43:31,905
give me a double double
on the rocks.

690
00:43:31,973 --> 00:43:33,304
Hey,Jones gal.

691
00:43:33,374 --> 00:43:34,341
Hi, Carmen.

692
00:43:34,408 --> 00:43:35,534
How's tricks?

693
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:37,237
Slow, Frankie.

694
00:43:37,311 --> 00:43:39,871
You still carrying a blowtorch
for that boy in the stockade?

695
00:43:39,947 --> 00:43:42,541
I reckon by now
it ought to be so hot

696
00:43:42,617 --> 00:43:44,915
you can send it
to the navy.

697
00:43:44,986 --> 00:43:47,511
They could use it
to weld battleships apart.

698
00:43:47,588 --> 00:43:49,920
That's how it is.

699
00:43:49,991 --> 00:43:51,515
Husky Miller!

700
00:43:51,592 --> 00:43:54,425
Frankie,
Husky Miller!

701
00:44:17,585 --> 00:44:19,018
Thanks a lot

702
00:44:19,086 --> 00:44:21,020
I'm sure
glad to be

703
00:44:21,088 --> 00:44:23,682
To be where
I can see

704
00:44:23,758 --> 00:44:25,726
So many
friends of mine

705
00:44:25,793 --> 00:44:28,193
How've I been doin'?

706
00:44:28,262 --> 00:44:30,355
How've I been doin'?

707
00:44:30,431 --> 00:44:33,229
If you really
want to know the truth

708
00:44:33,301 --> 00:44:35,292
I'm doin' fine

709
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:39,465
1 7 decisions in a row

710
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,599
And only five on points

711
00:44:41,676 --> 00:44:44,611
The rest was all K.O.

712
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:46,738
Jackson and Johnson

713
00:44:46,814 --> 00:44:48,714
Murphy and Bronson

714
00:44:48,783 --> 00:44:50,478
One by one
they come

715
00:44:50,551 --> 00:44:52,712
And one by one
to dreamland

716
00:44:52,787 --> 00:44:55,449
They go

717
00:44:55,523 --> 00:44:56,922
How's it done?

718
00:44:56,991 --> 00:44:58,891
You asked me
how's it done

719
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,451
I got a trainer man

720
00:45:01,529 --> 00:45:04,327
Who taught me
all I know

721
00:45:04,398 --> 00:45:08,926
Sure feels good to
have him in my corner

722
00:45:09,003 --> 00:45:11,938
Hear his voice
a-whispering low

723
00:45:12,006 --> 00:45:13,906
Big boy, remember

724
00:45:13,975 --> 00:45:19,743
You must remember

725
00:45:19,814 --> 00:45:21,406
Stand up and fight

726
00:45:21,482 --> 00:45:23,848
Until you
hear the bell

727
00:45:23,918 --> 00:45:25,681
Stand toe to toe

728
00:45:25,753 --> 00:45:28,119
Trade blow for blow

729
00:45:28,189 --> 00:45:32,285
Keep punchin' till you
make your punches tell

730
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:36,854
Show that crowd
what you know

731
00:45:36,931 --> 00:45:38,922
Until you
hear that bell

732
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,865
That final bell

733
00:45:40,935 --> 00:45:44,769
Stand up
and fight like hell

734
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,941
When you fight
out in the open air

735
00:45:57,018 --> 00:45:58,849
In a patch of light

736
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,980
The ring looks
small and white

737
00:46:02,056 --> 00:46:04,183
Out in the blackness

738
00:46:04,258 --> 00:46:06,317
Out in the blackness

739
00:46:06,394 --> 00:46:11,696
You can feel a hundred
thousand eyes fill the night

740
00:46:11,766 --> 00:46:15,668
Cigarettes are blinkin'
in the dark

741
00:46:15,736 --> 00:46:20,901
And makin' polka dots
around the baseball park

742
00:46:20,975 --> 00:46:22,875
People are quiet

743
00:46:22,944 --> 00:46:25,139
Then there's a riot

744
00:46:25,212 --> 00:46:26,679
Someone throws a punch

745
00:46:26,747 --> 00:46:31,741
And plants it
right smack on the mark

746
00:46:31,819 --> 00:46:33,480
Someone's hurt

747
00:46:33,554 --> 00:46:35,749
You kinda
think it's you

748
00:46:35,823 --> 00:46:38,223
You hang across the ropes

749
00:46:38,292 --> 00:46:41,056
That's all
you want to do

750
00:46:41,128 --> 00:46:45,394
Then you look around
and see your trainer's eyes

751
00:46:45,466 --> 00:46:48,799
Beggin' you
to see it through

752
00:46:48,869 --> 00:46:51,929
They say,
remember, big boy

753
00:46:52,006 --> 00:46:56,636
Remember

754
00:46:56,711 --> 00:47:00,875
Stand up and fight
until you hear the bell

755
00:47:00,948 --> 00:47:03,212
Stand toe to toe

756
00:47:03,284 --> 00:47:04,945
Trade blow for blow

757
00:47:05,019 --> 00:47:09,479
Keep punchin' till you
make your punches tell

758
00:47:09,557 --> 00:47:14,494
Show that crowd
what you know

759
00:47:14,562 --> 00:47:16,393
Until you
hear that bell

760
00:47:16,464 --> 00:47:18,489
That final bell

761
00:47:18,566 --> 00:47:21,501
Stand up
and fight like hell

762
00:47:21,569 --> 00:47:23,901
Stand up and fight

763
00:47:23,971 --> 00:47:27,737
Stand up and fight

764
00:47:27,808 --> 00:47:30,333
And fight

765
00:47:30,411 --> 00:47:37,374
Like hell

766
00:47:37,651 --> 00:47:39,312
Three cheers
for Husky Miller,

767
00:47:39,387 --> 00:47:41,355
the comin' champion
of the world.

768
00:47:41,422 --> 00:47:42,582
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

769
00:47:42,656 --> 00:47:44,624
Drinks for everybody
in the house.

770
00:47:44,692 --> 00:47:46,626
Inform the gentleman
behind the bar.

771
00:47:46,694 --> 00:47:48,184
Drinks on
Husky Miller!

772
00:47:48,262 --> 00:47:49,593
Hello, Heat-Wave.

773
00:47:49,663 --> 00:47:51,028
Introduce yourself.

774
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,766
You talk like
you know me already.

775
00:47:54,835 --> 00:47:57,702
I noticed you right off
up on the balcony.

776
00:47:57,772 --> 00:47:59,137
Did you notice me?

777
00:47:59,206 --> 00:48:00,537
Why, no.

778
00:48:00,608 --> 00:48:02,303
You was actin'
so bashful,

779
00:48:02,376 --> 00:48:04,708
I didn't hardly
know you was there.

780
00:48:04,779 --> 00:48:06,337
You talkin'
to the champ.

781
00:48:06,414 --> 00:48:08,780
He looks at a chicken,
and she's down--

782
00:48:08,849 --> 00:48:09,941
Shut your teeth.

783
00:48:10,017 --> 00:48:11,507
Excuse my dust,
gentlemen.

784
00:48:11,585 --> 00:48:14,315
The air's getting mighty
unconditioned around here.

785
00:48:14,388 --> 00:48:16,322
What are you
getting paid for,

786
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:20,326
to manage me in the ring
or K.O. me with the dames?

787
00:48:20,394 --> 00:48:22,692
This chick needs
a big investment of time,

788
00:48:22,763 --> 00:48:25,732
which you is mighty short of,
with the train waitin'.

789
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,131
It don't leave for an hour.

790
00:48:27,201 --> 00:48:28,691
It's waitin'
at the station.

791
00:48:28,769 --> 00:48:31,533
Remember, you promised the trainer
1 O hours shut-eye.

792
00:48:33,407 --> 00:48:36,706
OK, I ain't going to
break no promise to him.

793
00:48:36,777 --> 00:48:39,302
But you listen to this
and listen good.

794
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:42,349
When I wake up in Chicago
tomorrow morning,

795
00:48:42,416 --> 00:48:44,748
I want to see Heat-Wave
on the platform.

796
00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:47,344
Suppose she don't
want to go to Chicago?

797
00:48:47,421 --> 00:48:48,718
That's your toothache.

798
00:48:48,789 --> 00:48:51,314
If you can't
show up with her,

799
00:48:51,392 --> 00:48:53,326
find yourself
a new meal ticket.

800
00:48:53,394 --> 00:48:54,725
Good night, all!

801
00:48:54,795 --> 00:48:56,353
- Good night!
- Good night!

802
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:59,729
Hey, what's he mean,
go find yourself a new meal ticket?

803
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,734
He means I don't eat.

804
00:49:01,802 --> 00:49:05,075
And, brother,
if I don't eat, you starve.

805
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:09,005
Come on, Myrt, let's go
where the money is.

806
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:11,980
I believe we had
this parking space reserved,

807
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:14,040
but don't get up.
Please don't.

808
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:19,554
Don't these gentlemen look
like they met us someplace before?

809
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,989
I'd swear I met them
with Husky Miller.

810
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:23,993
Where you
know Husky from?

811
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:25,551
Maybe New York,
New Orleans.

812
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,961
What you doin' in
this hamburger joint?

813
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:29,157
Passin' through.

814
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:31,724
Then you don't know
nobody in here?

815
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,702
Who you
want us to know?

816
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:34,896
Her.
