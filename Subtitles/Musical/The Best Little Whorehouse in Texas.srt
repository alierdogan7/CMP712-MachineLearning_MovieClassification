of the Texas Aggies-Texas U
football game at Thanksgiving,

235
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,924
they were treated to a night
out at the Chicken Ranch

236
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,423
by their alumni association.

237
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,970

the real trouble started

238
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,676
brewin' about three days before.

thrilled we are with your contribution.

Thank you, Rita.

Those kids'll be so excited,
and the mayor, too.

242

I'm sorry the sheriff
wasn't here to thank you.

256
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,230
He drove over to Meritsville.
He'll be gone all afternoon.

264
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,146
Sure are. The Sheriff's real
particular about security out there.

265
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,717
Well, one of these nights when you
ain't on duty, you drop in out there.

My girls would love to show
you a little appreciation.

I'm a married man! (LAUGHS)

268
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,729

What's the matter?

275
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,037
You're in bed already. So?

276
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,456
So, I told you 100 times,

277
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,541
watching you get
undressed is the best part.

278
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,502
The best part?

279
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:03,505
Well, maybe not the best part,
but in the top two.

280
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,263
(LAUGHS)

281
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:09,393

my little honey?

283
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:19,107

I got a surprise for you.

284
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,609
I went by the post
office this morning.

285
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:24,238
I picked up a package. The very latest
thing from Frederick's of Hollywood.

286
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,409
Yeah?
Just a little something sexy

287
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,158
I thought you might like.

288
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,276
What do you think? Little?

289
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,614
It don't look too little to me.

290
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,074
Well, it certainly
ain't a trainin' bra,

291
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,875
but I do believe
I can fill it out.

292
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,293
I don't think you
got any problem there.

293
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,245
I'll be back with more.

294
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,416
(LAUGHS) You know, Mona,

295
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,751
I've known a lot
of women in my life.

296
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,929
None of 'em has ever been
exciting to me like you are.

297
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,592
Really? Even after all these years
we've been meetin' like this?

298
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,138
I'll tell you something.

299
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:58,022
A year with you is like
a minute of sheer happiness.

300
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,439
Well, now, that is just about the
sweetest thing anybody ever said to me.

301
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,573
I know.

302
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,402

00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:10,997

The romantic in me.

304
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,872

305
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,254
Whoo! You did that real fast.

306
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,214
Well, honey,
I've had a lot of practice

307
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,795
gettin' in and
out of my clothes.

308
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,014

309
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,383
Hot damn.

310
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,893

311
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,688
Whoo. (LAUGHING)

312
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,728
(LAUGHING)

313
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,815
Well, you don't look real sexy.

314
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,022
What do you mean?
I look like I always look.

315
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:45,364
That's just it.

316
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,861
It's them damn
droopy boxer drawers.

317
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,488
I just hate
the looks of them things.

318
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,536
I've worn boxer
shorts for years!

319
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,158
And they look like it.

320
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,332
These are a brand-new pair.

321
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,576
I don't know what you're talkin'
about, "I don't look sexy."

322
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,879
People tell me I have a real
sexy quality about me.

323
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,294
Well, you do,
but them boxer shorts don't.

324
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:06,173
But when I was gettin' me some
sexy things, I thought about you,

325
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,596
because they have a his 'n' hers
sexy department at Frederick's

326
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,844
and I thought you
might try that on for size.

327
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,268
What the hell is it,
a Japanese slingshot?

328
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,515
(LAUGHS)

329
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:19,395
No, it's jockey shorts with
little silver snaps on the side.

330
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,695
Mmm. Little is the key word here.
They are real little.

331
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,817
In fact, a guy could hurt
himself wearin' those things.

332
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,523
I don't think so,
thank you very much.

333
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:32,446
Ed Earl, I paid $20 for these, plus
postage. And I want you to wear it.

334
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:34,997
Aw, you paid $20 for these?

335
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,164
MONA: Yes!

336
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:37,541
Well, you got screwed.

337
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,328
Come on, Ed Earl!

338
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:41,875
ED EARL: No!

339
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,082
If they look half as good on you
as I think they're going to

340
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,384
you ain't gonna have to
wear 'em but a second.

341
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:47,627
Maybe less.

342
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,672
They're ridiculous.
They're impossible.

343
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:51,802
They're sexy.

344
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,428
No, no, no!

345
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,557
Well, fine! Then I'm gettin'
dressed and goin' home.

346
00:18:56,719 --> 00:19:00,565
Well, fine! I'm goin' in the
bathroom and... Put these on.

347
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,943

balls in a marble bag.

00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,908
Well, I saw Dulcie
Mae in town today.

350
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,158
ED EARL: Oh, yeah?

351
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,915
I guess you'll be goin' over
there for Thanksgivin' dinner.

352
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,458
ED EARL: Don't I always?

353
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,089
You know, you better check
that turkey of hers,

354
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,758
because there's a hook
in there that's gonna

355
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,585
drag your ass to
a wedding chapel.

356
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,680
ED EARL: (CHUCKLES) No way.

357
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,600
I don't believe in matrimony.
It screws up a relationship.

358
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,556
Amen to that, Ed Earl.

359
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,100
Ready?

360
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,443
Oh, I'm always ready.

How'd you like it?

363
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,780
I didn't hardly
get to even see them!

364
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,370
That's all you're gonna see,

365
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,201
'cause I ain't gonna parade
around like no model.

366
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,587
Aw, come on, Ed Earl. For me.

367
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:05,959
No! No.

368
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,424

down in Houston.

00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,679

plannin' an expose
on the Chicken Ranch.

Melvin P. Thorpe!

00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,730
He's that crazy
consumer advocate.

473
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,983
Has a report on
the late night news.

474
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,857
He's got a new show now,
a half hour once a week,

00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,238
<i>The Watchdog Report.</i>
It's <i>on tonight.</i>

476
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,659
The Chicken Ranch on TV.
Now, come on, fellas.

477
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,324
Television is a family medium.

478
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,034
But he's a sensationalist,
Ed Earl.

479
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:38,291
He shows up with his TV cameras every
time a consumer has a complaint.

480
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,213
He's a menace to
the business community.

481
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,258
He's that feller that put the
peanuts back in the chocolate bar.

482
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,010
What?

483
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,088
He made the makers of the
Peanut Delight candy bar

484
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,391
admit that they put less peanuts

485
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,093
in each bar than
they advertised.

486
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,416
He made them change their ways.

487
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,421
Sounds like a tough customer.

488
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,368
He's got a lot of
influence out there.

489
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:59,645
If he brings cameras out
to the Chicken Ranch...

490
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:03,070
Come on, Rufus!
I'll make some phone calls.

491
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,899
I got a little influence
around this state myself.

492
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:13,035
Well, it's no use talkin'
to me about it, Sheriff!

493
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:16,412
Melvin P. Thorpe is now the biggest
attraction at this station.

494
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:21,171
High ratings. Lots of letters.
He doesn't listen to anybody.

495
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,586
Hell, he wants to go national!

496
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:26,043
Wants to be watchdog
for the whole U.S. of A.

497
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,803
Love to help you, Ed Earl,

498
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:30,238
but just like you don't want to
mess with the Chicken Ranch,

499
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,299
I don't wanna ruffle
this old bird's feathers.

500
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,974
Here in Houston, he's becomin'
a regular Texas attraction.

501
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,268
Well, now, wait a minute,
Ed Earl.

502
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:42,318
I'd tread easy on this one. Them
TV boys can be mighty powerful.

503
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,649
And mighty useful,

505
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:48,782
Excuse me, Ed Earl. I gotta go.

506
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,235
It's that damn
bilingual bullshit again.

507
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,112
Let me give you
a word of advice from

508
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:55,410
one elected official to another.

509
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,166
Be careful of the box.

510
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,215
Son of a bitch.
What the hell's going on?

511
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,042
This goddam Melvin P. Thorpe's
got the whole state bamboozled.

512
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,379
This is serious, Ed Earl.
You gotta do something.

513
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,467
I intend to.

514
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:15,471
Deputy Fred. I want you to hold
down the fort for a while.

515
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:16,969
Me? Yeah, you.

516
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,474
Where you goin'?

517
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:19,726
I'm goin' to Houston.
I'm gonna take care

518
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,307
of that little
pecker wood myself.

519
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,413
This is it. Thank you.

520
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,796
MELVIN: Come in.

521
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,547
Mr Thorpe?

522
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:53,968
I know you.

523
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:55,595
You do?

524
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:59,554
Sheriff Ed Earl Dodd. They told
me you were here. Come on in.

525
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:02,598
I hope I'm not...

526
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,017
Interrupting anything.

527
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,144
Oh, please!
It's my pleasure, my honor.

528
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,729
What brings you here to Houston?

529
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,405
Sit down. Anywhere over here.

530
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,903

I'm gettin' dressed.

531
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,778

I've got my TV show to do,

532
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,450

to talk to you about, Mr Thorpe.

534
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,409
Oop. Melvin.

535
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,492

536
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,536
Please. You watch the show, Ed?

537
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,792
Last week Well...

538
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,674
was the best ratin' we ever had.

539
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:32,006
The city planning commissioner
was drivin' a city car...

540
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,587
Just hold that for me, will you?

541
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,842
While he was on vacation.
Caught him dead to rights.

542
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,181
That pitiful putz.
Would you just pull that up?

543
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,228
What? Just pull that up.

544
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,895
And we broke a 30 share.

545
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,976
It's affectin' my pieces
on the late night news.

546
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,359
Up, up, up. They just
love my little report.

547
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,032
I hear you're very popular.

548
00:28:55,359 --> 00:29:00,866
The power of television, of public
exposure, is so great it scares me.

549
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,617
I swear, I could get the
mayor's own children

550
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,701
to throw rocks at him.

551
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,500
Which show did
you like best, Ed?

552
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,376
I think the one about the...

553
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,623
Nuts in the chocolate bar.

554
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,762
That's one of my favorites.

555
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,302
"Threescore" means 60,
like the Bible says.

556
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:21,477
So, if it says "60
nuts" on the wrapper,

557
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,600
I wanna see 60 nuts inside.

558
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,479
And I'm talkin' full nuts.
I'm not talkin' a half nut,

559
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,851
or nut bits or nut chips.

560
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,071
I'm talkin' a full nut.

561
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,906
I can see that.

562
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:43,616
Thank God we still live in
a society where anything

563
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:46,793
that's phony or dishonest
can't stand the light of day.

564
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,545
Sock. Beg your pardon?

565
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,918
Uh, sock.

566
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,091
Thank you. Yeah.

567
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:58,005
Most corporations involved
in false advertisin'

568
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,724
would just laugh at a $50 fine.

569
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,431
But you show up
with your TV camera

570
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,808
and give them
a little bad publicity

571
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:10,067
and they shape up faster than goose
shit slides through a tin horn.

00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:18,026
Well, Melvin, it's that bad publicity
I want to talk to you about.

575
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,528
That could hurt people.
You take that report

576
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,157
you're doin' on
the Chicken Ranch.

577
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,782
That place is older
than rocks and water.

578
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:28,160
I wouldn't be surprised if your
granddaddy took your daddy out there

the birds and the bees.

Texas suits my style.

583
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:42,849
The point I'm tryin' to make is

584
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,268
that every schoolboy in
the state knows about it.

585
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,854
Most of the politicians
have slept there.

586
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,057
And the mayor and the people of
my county that voted for me,

587
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,767
they want to keep
things just the way they are.

588
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:55,779
Hmm. You know something,
Sheriff, it just struck me.

589
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,282
We are in the same profession.

590
00:30:58,357 --> 00:30:59,404

I'm out there fightin' for the
rights of the public, just like you.

in protectin' the public.

600
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:21,847
Well, Melvin,
everybody'd be happy

601

if you'd just drop
the whole thing.

602

Ah.

603
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,223

604

a necessary function.

605

606

Right or wrong
don't interest me!

607

I'm no moralizer. I leave
all that to the preacher.

608
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,317
Well, I'm glad.

609
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:40,441
Anyway, the mayor was
thinkin' maybe

610
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:41,867
you'd want a little
unnecessary publicity.

611
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:45,913
(LAUGHS) Unnecessary publicity?
He's got me all wrong!

612
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:49,617
I'm not one of those sensation
mongers out to boost his own ego!

nothing to fear from me on that score.

He'll be happy to hear that.

what is goin' on out there

845
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:20,706
and what kind of pay-off
you're acceptin' to protect

846
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,916
that notorious
house of ill repute.

847
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:24,213
CROWD: Ooh!

848
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:41,567
First thing. First thing is you're
standin' in Lanville County,

849
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,316
which, by my figurin',
is about a 100 miles west

850
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,443
of that stink hole
you call Houston.

851
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,658
So I can't see
it's any of your business

852
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,201
what goes on out here.

853
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:53,238
Oh, yeah? Please...

854
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:57,743
Number two. You ain't the
law around here and I am.

855
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:01,045
So don't be tellin' me what
my goddamn job is,

856
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:05,170
or I'll whip your butt so bad it'll
look like the stripes on a barber pole.

857
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,417
BOY: Get him, Sheriff.

858
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:07,969
May be mean, but he's ours!

859
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:10,763
Number three.
No sawed-off little pecker

860
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,933
is gonna accuse me of takin' a
bribe and live to tell about it

861
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,557
'cause I wear the badge
in this goddamn county.

862
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:20,391
So you listen and listen good, you
over-padded, televisin' turd.

863
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,726
If I ever see you or any
of those little bastards

864
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,727
that work for you
in my town again,

865
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,980
I'm gonna knock you
so flat you're gonna

866
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:28,610
have to roll down
your socks to shit!

867
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,032
(MOANING)

868
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:31,951
That's tellin' him, Sheriff!

869
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,323
Oh, my goodness!

870
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:35,201
So get outta here, you goddamn,

871
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,908
wig-wearin',
citified son of a bitch!

872
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,412
(GUNSHOT)

873
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:46,800
(SPUTTERING) Holy shit!
Oh, my God, that man's crazy!

874
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,296
Oh! Ooh.

875
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,349
Move, you schmuck!

876
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,895
Move it! Come on!

877
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:04,229
Get outta here! Move this thing!

878
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:07,437
Come on, move this thing!
I'll get you for this.

879
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:10,566
You son of a bitch!
You'll pay for this.

880
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:13,660
You're in trouble, Sheriff!
You're in big trouble!

881
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,946
So long, partner.

882
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,205
(LAUGHING)

883
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:47,519
Boy, you sent him hightailin'.
I was so proud of you!

884
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:48,728
Didn't I? Yeah.

885
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,115
Mmm-hmm. (LAUGHS)

886
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,781
Look at them stars.

887
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:56,952
Mmm.

888
00:44:57,862 --> 00:45:00,115
Well, there ain't nothin'
prettier than a Texas sky.

889
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,124
Ain't that the truth.

890
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,746
Hey, look! Did you
see that shootin' star?

891
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,081
Mmm-hmm.

892
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:11,212
Yeah. That could've been
a spaceship, you know.

893
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:12,332
You believe in spaceships?

894
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,468
Sure.

895
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,884
I saw a picture once.

896
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,091
Them fellers that's supposed
to be from up there.

897
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:19,596
Fly around. Uh-huh.

898
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:22,850
Tiny little fellers,
bald-headed.

899
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,348
Little feet,
little hands, got no peckers.

900
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:27,854
Got no peckers?

901
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:32,192
Well, I ain't interested.
(LAUGHS)

902
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,653
I don't think my
girls would be either.

903
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,325
(CHUCKLES)

904
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:40,076
MONA: When I was a little kid, I
used to imagine a flyin' saucer

905
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:43,658
swoopin' down and pickin' me up
and takin' me off to heaven.

906
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,451
Like the angels.

907
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:46,835
ED EARL: Mmm-hmm.

908
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:50,123
"L looked, and behold, a whirlwind
comin' out of the north.

909
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:51,674
"And out of the midst
of the fire came the

910
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,376
"likeness of four
living creatures."

911
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,282
What the hell you talkin' about?

912
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:57,509
Well, that's from the Bible.

913
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,807
That's what the Bible says
about spaceships in Ezekiel.

914
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,259
Don't you know
nothin' about the Bible?

915
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:02,764
Yeah, I know about the Bible!

916
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:05,043
I just don't know nothin'
about no Ezekiel in the Bible.

917
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:09,017
I knew Ezekiel Peebles
once in the eighth grade.

918
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,444
Think I busted his jaw.

919
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,646
Mmm.

920
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,572
Well, that was
very Christian of you.

921
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:18,071
Well, most of my
family was Baptist.

922
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,537
Well, I never stayed
with one family long enough

923
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:23,101
to become
anything in particular.

924
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:26,041
But I read the Bible.
I believe in Jesus.

925
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,578
I think Jesus was...

926
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:30,747
Was a real good man.

927
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,669
And he was a heck of a speaker.

928
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:37,046
Yep. I knew a woman once
that had a vision of Jesus.

929
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:40,678
He came right in her house, set
right down at the foot of her bed.

930
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,057
Mmm-hmm?

931
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,309
I don't know what I'd do
if that happened to me.

932
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,141
I'll tell you something, honey.

933
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,973
If Jesus comes to your house,
all hell's gonna break loose.

934
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:50,562
(LAUGHS)

935
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:51,858
(CHUCKLES)

936
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,811
You got a point there, Ed Earl.

937
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:55,400
But you know,
Jesus was really good

938
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,231
to Mary Magdalene,
the fallen woman.

939
00:46:57,732 --> 00:46:59,700
He was always
bein' very sociable.

940
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:03,955
He went to this big weddin'
once and they ran out of wine.

941
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,282
You know what he did?
Turned the water into wine.

942
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:09,911
Well, that's a man that knows
how to throw a party.

943
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:12,539
Now, don't be sacrilegious.

944
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:16,126
I'm not.
I'm not. He forgives me.

945
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,753
He knows I was kiddin'.

946
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:20,346
Yeah, I know he forgives you.

947
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:23,015
That's funny, now,
how God can forgive you,

948
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,888
and people can't.
Now why is that?

949
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:29,814
Well, because people are not
very God-like, Mona.

950
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:31,940
I know.

951
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,067
I know.

952
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:36,437
Yeah.

953
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:40,859
(TRAIN WHISTLE

What is it?

00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,131
Melvin P. Thorpe

957
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:58,968
is a sorry son of a bitch.

(LAUGHING)

960
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,640
You reckon he's gonna
run for the legislature?

961
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:09,269
Why?

962
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:14,809
I never told
anybody this, Mona, but...

963
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:19,598
I was thinkin' of runnin'
for the legislature someday.

964
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,442
Are you serious, Ed Earl?

965
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:23,651
Yeah.

966
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,955
They say an honest man can't be
elected in this country anymore.

967
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,741
But I don't believe that.

968
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:33,369
This is a good country.

969
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,497
I believe I could win.

970
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:39,543
Well, you got my vote.
I might even go register.

971
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:42,796
Boy, I sure didn't know
you had dreams that big.

972
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:43,925
Hmm.

973
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,597
People really do
like you, though.

974
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:46,799
They like you, too.

975
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,008
Really? Sure.

976
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:50,811
You ask anybody
in town about you.

977
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:52,438
Say,
"How do you like Miss Mona?"

978
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:57,189
They say, "Shoot, she's a fine woman.
Fine, friendly and nice."

979
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:58,485
Huh.

980
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:02,065
Well, I always just thought if you
see somebody without a smile,

981
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:03,866
you give 'em yours.

982
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,363
I like that.

983
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:07,904
I like that.

984
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:11,036
Think I'll use that
as my campaign slogan.

985
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:15,370
If you see somebody without
a smile, give 'em yours.

986
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:17,750
I'm gonna have that
printed up on a little card.

987
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:21,042
Oh, you're kiddin' me.
You smart-ass.

988
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:23,427
I had a dream once.

989
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,337
Yeah?

990
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:27,014
I'll tell you if
you won't laugh.

991
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,762
Oh, I won't laugh.

992
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:31,390
Well, I used to dream
of bein' a ballerina.

996
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,270
Yes, a ballerina!

997
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:45,616
(LAUGHS) Well,
I think that's wonderful.

998
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,380
And I think you still could be a
ballerina if you wanted to be.

999
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:50,488
No, you could!
Oh, don't be ridiculous!

1000
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:53,620
Go into training right now.
Just start jumpin' up and down.

1001
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,918
Me? Jumpin' up and down?
I'd black both my eyes.

1002
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:57,579
(LAUGHS)

1003
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,956
I couldn't be a ballerina now.
I'm too top-heavy.

1004
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:01,639
I have a hard enough
time balancin' these

1005
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,633
things now,
without gettin' on my toes.

1006
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:13,386
You know something?

1007
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:14,641
What?

1008
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:18,107
You know that, uh, I don't
see anybody but you anymore.

1009
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:21,527
Course, now, you can't
say the same, can you?

1010
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:29,277
I haven't been to bed with another
woman besides you in three years.

1011
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:32,279
You didn't know that, did you?

1012
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,787
No, I didn't know that.

00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,787

once you've had the best.

handle that situation?

to give me a little cooperation

doors to the regular customers,

planned, that'd be all right?

caused any trouble to anybody.

Huh? I swear.

1686
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:46,043
Governor, if
the citizens who elected me

1687
01:31:46,126 --> 01:31:48,174
found it necessary
for me to close it down,

1688
01:31:48,253 --> 01:31:49,926
I would close it down.

1689
01:31:50,005 --> 01:31:54,351
If Miss Mona and the girls that work
for her were jeopardizin' the health,

1690

wealth or moral scruples of the
community, I would close it down.

a piddlin' nuisance,

I would close it down!

Here they are, Governor.
What you've been waitin' for.

Aha. I'm sorry, Ed Earl.

42 to 37, with 21% undecided.

The polls. You can't expect
me to go against the polls.

down at the gate.

1846
01:43:52,852 --> 01:43:54,274
Mona,
you know me better than that.

1847
01:43:54,353 --> 01:43:56,113
Ed Earl, I believe
the thing for you to do is

1848
01:43:56,147 --> 01:43:57,865
just to put this
whole thing behind you

1849
01:43:57,940 --> 01:43:59,942
just as quick as you can.

1850
01:44:00,025 --> 01:44:03,404
I've made a little money, I've laughed
some, I've danced to the music.

1851
01:44:03,487 --> 01:44:05,581
It's just time to pay
the fiddler, that's all.

1852
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:10,787
Mona, we've been
together a long time.

1853
01:44:12,329 --> 01:44:14,627
Sometimes I think you know me
better than I know myself.

1854
01:44:17,293 --> 01:44:19,091
So you know how hard
this is for me to say.

1855
01:44:21,672 --> 01:44:23,015
I love you.

1856
01:44:25,843 --> 01:44:27,516
Will you marry me?

1857
01:44:27,928 --> 01:44:31,603
Oh, Ed Earl, I've loved you
since I was 16-years-old.

1858
01:44:32,141 --> 01:44:34,690
But I've thought about
this for a long time.

1859
01:44:35,102 --> 01:44:36,820
And as much as I'd
love for it to work,

1860
01:44:37,563 --> 01:44:40,362
I know deep down in my heart
it ain't never gonna be.

1861
01:44:41,066 --> 01:44:42,784
Didn't you hear what I said?

1862
01:44:43,027 --> 01:44:44,119
I did, darlin'.

1863
01:44:44,195 --> 01:44:46,698
But it's gonna
always be just like it is.

1864
01:44:47,490 --> 01:44:50,243
There just ain't no way
in this world it can work.

1865
01:44:51,076 --> 01:44:52,953
We could make it work.

1866
01:44:53,204 --> 01:44:54,706
Just have to give it a chance.
