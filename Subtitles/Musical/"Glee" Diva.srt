1
00:00:00,398 --> 00:00:01,069
(school bell ringing)

2
00:00:01,091 --> 00:00:02,926
KURT:
<i>Look at her.</i>

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,203
<i>This class is supposed to be</i>
<i>Free Sing... for everyone...</i>

4
00:00:06,221 --> 00:00:07,921
<i>but Rachel</i>
<i>hasn't stopped screeching</i>

5
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:10,608
<i>like a third-rate Maria Callas</i>
<i>since the bell rang.</i>

6
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:12,943
<i>Because I'm her best friend,</i>
<i>I can say this...</i>

7
00:00:12,978 --> 00:00:14,645
<i>Rachel's always been</i>
<i>a little insufferable,</i>

8
00:00:14,696 --> 00:00:17,615
<i>but ever since she won</i>
<i>Winter Showcase,</i>

9
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:19,533
<i>her ego and behavior</i>
<i>are out of control.</i>

10
00:00:19,568 --> 00:00:20,934
<i>At home she uses up</i>
<i>all the hot water,</i>

11
00:00:20,952 --> 00:00:22,153
<i>leaves rings in the tub,</i>

12
00:00:22,204 --> 00:00:23,654
<i>and don't get me started</i>

13
00:00:23,705 --> 00:00:26,440
<i>on the hair extensions</i>
<i>clogging the sink.</i>

14
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,376
<i>At school</i>
<i>she eschews my company</i>

15
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,661
<i>and instead surrounds herself</i>
<i>with easily awed sycophants.</i>

16
00:00:30,712 --> 00:00:32,963
Oh, my God, Rachel.

17
00:00:32,998 --> 00:00:36,384
BroadwayWorld.com is saying
that the long-rumored revival

18
00:00:36,418 --> 00:00:39,637
of <i>Funny Girl</i> is finally
happening this season.

19
00:00:39,671 --> 00:00:40,805
You have to audition.

20
00:00:40,839 --> 00:00:42,056
I couldn't.

21
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,624
Okay, there is only
one Fanny Brice,

22
00:00:43,642 --> 00:00:46,310
and that is
the Ms. Barbra Streisand.

23
00:00:46,345 --> 00:00:48,396
But you're
Barbra's heir apparent.

24
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:51,799
(phone ringing)

25
00:00:51,817 --> 00:00:53,967
You gonna get that?
<i>On some level.</i>

26
00:00:53,985 --> 00:00:55,152
<i>I always knew</i>
<i>this would happen...</i>

27
00:00:55,187 --> 00:00:56,970
<i>that, as Rachel's star rose,</i>

28
00:00:56,988 --> 00:00:59,907
<i>so, too, would her prima donna-</i>
<i>like tendencies.</i>

29
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:01,776
(cheering)

30
00:01:03,528 --> 00:01:05,496
<i>Yes, it's become clear to me:</i>

31
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:06,864
<i>This Sarah Brightman</i>
<i>in training</i>

32
00:01:06,915 --> 00:01:09,083
<i>needs to be knocked down</i>
<i>a few pegs,</i>

33
00:01:09,117 --> 00:01:11,118
<i>and I'm the only one</i>
<i>who can do it.</i>

34
00:01:11,142 --> 00:01:13,422
<font color="#40bfff">Sync & corrections by <font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font></font>
<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

35
00:01:14,056 --> 00:01:15,756
I can't do this,
I can't do this.

36
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:17,658
There's ten days to
the wedding, and I have

37
00:01:17,676 --> 00:01:19,260
all these choices
to make by myself.

38
00:01:19,294 --> 00:01:20,994
I mean, I know Will trusts me,

39
00:01:21,012 --> 00:01:22,763
but I'm a Libra...
I can't do this.

40
00:01:22,798 --> 00:01:24,014
Well, when does he get back?

41
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:25,049
End of the week,

42
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,050
but it was a big success.

43
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:27,501
Will said that they got

44
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,053
Congress to agree to cut
federal arts funding

45
00:01:29,104 --> 00:01:31,505
in schools by 35% instead of 50.

46
00:01:31,523 --> 00:01:32,606
Pretty amazing.
Yeah.

47
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:34,108
So, are you guys going
on a honeymoon

48
00:01:34,142 --> 00:01:35,109
or something?

49
00:01:35,143 --> 00:01:37,177
Um, I'm sure we will.

50
00:01:37,195 --> 00:01:38,946
Will keeps suggesting
Costa Rica, but,

51
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,232
I mean, us gingers can't be
that close to the equator.

52
00:01:41,283 --> 00:01:42,566
Why are you asking?

53
00:01:42,617 --> 00:01:44,034
I just assumed
that Mr. Shue is going

54
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:45,686
to want his glee club back.

55
00:01:45,704 --> 00:01:47,238
Well, look, I-I don't think
you need to worry

56
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:48,456
about Will kicking you
out on the street,

57
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,074
especially not after you did

58
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,743
such an extraordinary job
while he was gone.

59
00:01:52,794 --> 00:01:54,361
I mean, you coached a
really inexperienced team

60
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:55,629
all the way to regionals.

61
00:01:55,664 --> 00:01:57,531
I think
that's pretty impressive.

62
00:01:57,549 --> 00:01:59,032
Regionals is
a different ball game.

63
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,034
You need these big,
brassy voices

64
00:02:01,052 --> 00:02:04,472
to bully the competition...
Rachel, Santana, Mercedes,

65
00:02:04,506 --> 00:02:06,373
even Kurt.
Blaine can do that.

66
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:08,476
Yeah, but it's, it's about more
than just being able to sing.

67
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,043
It's about the attitude,
you know?

68
00:02:10,061 --> 00:02:11,762
Yeah. Those kids didn't
just want to win,

69
00:02:11,813 --> 00:02:13,264
they wanted to crush
the competition.

70
00:02:13,315 --> 00:02:15,232
Well, maybe you should have
a lesson that toughens 'em up.

71
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:16,817
You know, I mean,
weren't there weeks

72
00:02:16,852 --> 00:02:19,103
where Will had you guys
competing against each other?

73
00:02:19,154 --> 00:02:21,822
That's the perfect idea,
Miss Pillsbury, thank you.

74
00:02:21,857 --> 00:02:23,724
Very welcome.
And you can be

75
00:02:23,742 --> 00:02:26,277
our special celebrity
guest judge to help decide

76
00:02:26,328 --> 00:02:27,578
who wins.

77
00:02:27,612 --> 00:02:29,396
(bell ringing) Diva.

78
00:02:29,414 --> 00:02:30,414
FINN: So, now that we're
back in the game,

79
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:32,566
we've got to come strong.

80
00:02:32,584 --> 00:02:34,919
Diva Week is all about finding
your inner powerhouse.

81
00:02:34,953 --> 00:02:36,454
Miss Pillsbury.
That's right.

82
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:38,956
The Online Urban Dictionary
defines a diva as

83
00:02:39,007 --> 00:02:41,926
"a fierce, often temperamental
singer who comes correct.

84
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,844
"She is not a trick-ass ho

85
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,095
and she does not
sweat da haterz."

86
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,764
JAKE:
Great, so I guess the guys

87
00:02:46,798 --> 00:02:47,965
are screwed this week.
Um...

88
00:02:48,016 --> 00:02:49,934
(clears throat)
Guys can be divas.

89
00:02:49,968 --> 00:02:51,185
EMMA: That's right, we
all have inner divas.

90
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:52,770
I myself have been considered
quite a diva

91
00:02:52,804 --> 00:02:54,472
at many a local restaurant

92
00:02:54,523 --> 00:02:57,090
because I know what I want
and I will send a dish back.

93
00:02:57,108 --> 00:02:59,760
You all might as well just quit while
you're ahead because there are only

94
00:02:59,778 --> 00:03:02,262
two ways to spell Unique,
and one of them is.

95
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,316
D-I-V-A... Diva.
M'kay? Shanté, I stay,

96
00:03:05,367 --> 00:03:08,969
and it will be brought, dished
out, and served and mopped up

97
00:03:09,004 --> 00:03:10,971
by the time <i>you</i>
even pick out a wig.

98
00:03:11,006 --> 00:03:15,476
Looking at you,
clocking that sadness.

99
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,344
I have more diva in my little
finger than you have

100
00:03:17,378 --> 00:03:21,015
in your whole angry inch, Wade-Unique.
(laughs)

101
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:23,517
Tina, you've kind of been
talking some ridiculous trash

102
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:26,520
for months, unchallenged,
and that stops now.

103
00:03:26,554 --> 00:03:28,105
Use that finger, use that snap.

104
00:03:28,156 --> 00:03:29,723
Listen, guys can be divas.

105
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:31,058
You guys, I'm going
to win Diva Week.

106
00:03:31,076 --> 00:03:33,393
And do you know how I know
that? It's because...

is how I made the manager cry
at the Cheesecake Factory...

151
00:05:36,684 --> 00:05:37,901
by being a diva.

152
00:05:37,952 --> 00:05:40,904
(bell ringing) Yay, divas.

153
00:05:40,955 --> 00:05:42,156
(performing vocal exercises)

154
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,907
Oh, hey, you're awake.

155
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,326
An hour before my alarm clock.
Oh, when you're in there,

156
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,827
can you make me a little
tea, please, with some honey

157
00:05:46,861 --> 00:05:48,579
and lemon? You know, it's
really good for my throat.

158
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,465
Sure, I'll just run down
to the store and get you some.

159
00:05:51,499 --> 00:05:54,084
I'll take that as a no.

160
00:05:54,135 --> 00:05:56,870
An incredibly rude no
that deserves an explanation.

161
00:05:56,888 --> 00:05:58,472
Okay, Rachel, truth time.

162
00:05:58,506 --> 00:06:00,540
You have been a nightmare
ever since the Winter Showcase.

163
00:06:00,558 --> 00:06:02,142
I knew it... it was only
a matter of time

164
00:06:02,177 --> 00:06:04,044
before you became jealous
of all of my success.

165
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:05,679
And just when we were
getting inseparable.

166
00:06:05,713 --> 00:06:07,264
Oh... we became close

167
00:06:07,315 --> 00:06:08,515
because you became tolerable,

168
00:06:08,549 --> 00:06:09,716
but now you've got that weird

169
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:12,152
naked boyfriend and that
weird Legion of Sycophants.

170
00:06:12,187 --> 00:06:13,771
Now you are like,
you're like an annoying,

171
00:06:13,822 --> 00:06:16,490
self-righteous Lima Rachel
on steroids.

172
00:06:16,524 --> 00:06:18,609
You know what? Let me give you
a little bit of truth, Kurt.

173
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,060
Okay, the only reason
why Carmen Tibideaux

174
00:06:20,078 --> 00:06:21,779
even let you sing at
the Winter Showcase

175
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,530
was because she knew that
you and I were friends.

176
00:06:23,564 --> 00:06:25,399
You might have won the showcase,
but my performance

177
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:26,867
was the one
that everyone was talking about

178
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:30,337
because I blew you away

179
00:06:30,372 --> 00:06:31,955
and I can do it again.

180
00:06:32,006 --> 00:06:33,907
Midnight Madness...

181
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:35,742
you and me,
head-to-head.

182
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,463
I wouldn't do that
if I were you, babe.

183
00:06:39,514 --> 00:06:41,181
Oh, why not?

184
00:06:41,216 --> 00:06:43,050
'Cause I already beat you once.

185
00:06:43,084 --> 00:06:45,302
Diva-Off sophomore year.

186
00:06:45,353 --> 00:06:46,720
Remember?

187
00:06:46,754 --> 00:06:47,971
Only because I threw it.

188
00:06:48,022 --> 00:06:49,423
That high "F"
in "Defying Gravity"?

189
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:51,925
I can hit that baby
in my sleep.

190
00:06:51,943 --> 00:06:53,360
I tanked the note on purpose.

191
00:06:53,395 --> 00:06:54,728
Okay, why would you do that?

192
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:56,096
'Cause I didn't want to win.

193
00:06:56,114 --> 00:06:57,564
I wanted to save my dad
the embarrassment

194
00:06:57,598 --> 00:06:59,400
of having his son sing
a song written for a woman.

195
00:06:59,434 --> 00:07:00,701
I don't believe you.

196
00:07:00,735 --> 00:07:01,985
Take that back.

197
00:07:02,036 --> 00:07:03,237
I can't... it's truth time.

198
00:07:03,271 --> 00:07:06,073
That was my first big win.

199
00:07:06,107 --> 00:07:07,774
That was the foundation
that I built

200
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:09,776
all of my confidence on
for the past two years.

201
00:07:09,794 --> 00:07:10,994
Aw, consider it cracked.

202
00:07:11,045 --> 00:07:12,612
Get ready
for Diva-Off Part Two,

203
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,249
and this time
I'm not throwing anything.

204
00:07:15,283 --> 00:07:17,751
Enjoy your tea.

205
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:19,086
(bell ringing)

206
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,087
(grunts)

207
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:21,088
(inhales)

208
00:07:21,122 --> 00:07:22,756
(coughs)

209
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,675
Here, I put together a
little cold buster kit

210
00:07:24,726 --> 00:07:26,593
for you.

211
00:07:26,627 --> 00:07:28,628
Cool, uh, how did you know?

212
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:31,064
Your nose was red yesterday.

213
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:34,017
Start off with cough drops,
then two packs of vitamin C,

214
00:07:34,068 --> 00:07:36,303
a cup of my homemade
Chinese chicken soup,

215
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:37,588
and finish
with my secret weapon...

216
00:07:37,622 --> 00:07:38,972
nighttime cold medicine.

217
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,140
Aw, thank you.

218
00:07:40,175 --> 00:07:41,442
I really appreciate
this. It's gonna

219
00:07:41,476 --> 00:07:43,026
have me feeling
better in no time,

220
00:07:43,077 --> 00:07:44,745
except for maybe the
nighttime cold medicine.

221
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:46,363
Why? It's amazing.

222
00:07:46,414 --> 00:07:48,615
Just makes me really sleepy
and woozy, which is something

223
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:50,200
I can't afford to be right now,

224
00:07:50,251 --> 00:07:53,287
not with Diva Week
in full swing.

225
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:54,988
(clears throat)

226
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:57,657
I want to be able to prove
that men can be divas, too,

227
00:07:57,675 --> 00:07:59,126
which is why I'm
gonna give them

228
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,761
a full dose of some
Freddie Mercury...

229
00:08:00,795 --> 00:08:02,629
just to show how the
boys can really bring

230
00:08:02,663 --> 00:08:04,214
some diva attitude.

231
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:07,718
Mr. Anderson, you find new
ways to inspire me every day.

232
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:09,052
Aw. (Sniffs)
Thanks, Tina.

Santana, that was simply

in show business history.

321
00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:44,582

you were coming to town?

322
00:12:44,616 --> 00:12:46,051
You know, I think that
the better question is,

323
00:12:46,085 --> 00:12:47,769
why didn't you tell me
that you were dating Sam?

336
00:13:15,314 --> 00:13:19,150
which I am, then I'm gonna need
to know exactly what it is.

337
00:13:19,168 --> 00:13:21,036
NYADA's fight club,

338
00:13:21,087 --> 00:13:22,704
but singing instead of punching.

339
00:13:22,755 --> 00:13:24,205
Twice a year,

340
00:13:24,256 --> 00:13:25,707
we break into a classroom

341
00:13:25,758 --> 00:13:27,625
for a no-holds-barred
sing-off to the death.

342
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:29,660
Winner gets ultimate
bragging rights

343
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:32,497
for the rest of the time
that they're at NYADA,

344
00:13:32,515 --> 00:13:33,664
loser gets
shamed and humiliated.

345
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:35,133
Hm. Well, then I guess

346
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:36,468
I'm gonna have to beat Kurt.

347
00:13:36,502 --> 00:13:39,137
Oh, don't worry, you will. Hmm.

348
00:13:39,171 --> 00:13:41,172
We all heard about Taylor the
Latte Boy challenging you,

349
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,173
and... it's a joke.

350
00:13:42,191 --> 00:13:43,341
MAN 2:
Like those outfits of his?

351
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:44,675
Now, everyone knows

352
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:46,227
the only reason
Hummel got in is 'cause

353
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:48,113
he's Carmen's
pet turtle-face.

354
00:13:48,147 --> 00:13:49,347
And signing up for
Adam's Apples?

355
00:13:49,365 --> 00:13:50,848
He might as well
wear a sign around his neck

356
00:13:50,866 --> 00:13:52,016
that says, "I am pathetic",

357
00:13:52,034 --> 00:13:53,684
please club me to death."
Okay,

358
00:13:53,702 --> 00:13:55,820
Kurt earned his place here
at NYADA same as you two.

359
00:13:55,854 --> 00:13:57,155
Excuse me?

360
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:58,239
It's okay, Rachel.

361
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,290
I've dealt with a lot worse

362
00:13:59,325 --> 00:14:00,691
than bitchy gossip.

363
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:03,027
However I got here,
the point is, I'm here.

364
00:14:03,045 --> 00:14:04,963
And me, my outfits,
and my turtle-face

365
00:14:04,997 --> 00:14:06,798
aren't going anywhere.

366
00:14:06,832 --> 00:14:08,216
We'll see about that
at Midnight Madness.

367
00:14:12,805 --> 00:14:15,507
(school bell rings)

368
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,675
EMMA:
So, how did you find out?

369
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,427
She changed her Facebook
relationship status

370
00:14:19,478 --> 00:14:20,645
to "Shacked up."

371
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:23,098
Mine's still
"Heartbroken."

372
00:14:23,132 --> 00:14:24,382
I haven't been interested

373
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,317
in other women since
Rachel and I broke up.

374
00:14:26,352 --> 00:14:27,552
Well, maybe it's time to be.

375
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,487
There's a great new math sub.

376
00:14:29,522 --> 00:14:33,057
I know she's a little...
but... She's like 26.

377
00:14:33,075 --> 00:14:34,359
What do... what
do I have to offer

378
00:14:34,393 --> 00:14:35,360
a grown woman like that?

379
00:14:35,394 --> 00:14:36,995
I'm just a man-boy.

380
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:38,947
I get what it feels like
to be lonely.

381
00:14:38,998 --> 00:14:40,949
I haven't really
felt like myself

382
00:14:40,983 --> 00:14:42,534
since Will's been away,
and it's kind of scary.

383
00:14:42,568 --> 00:14:43,952
You know, sometimes
you feel like

384
00:14:44,003 --> 00:14:45,203
it's the only feeling
you're ever

385
00:14:45,237 --> 00:14:46,571
gonna have in the world.

386
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:49,007
(bell rings)

387
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,175
And it will be,

388
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:52,577
until you get back
in the saddle.

389
00:14:52,595 --> 00:14:54,078
Thanks, Miss Pillsbury.

390
00:14:54,096 --> 00:14:55,380
Honestly, you're
the only person here

391
00:14:55,414 --> 00:14:56,798
who can always cheer me up.

392
00:14:56,849 --> 00:14:58,683
Mr. Shue's a lucky guy.

393
00:14:58,717 --> 00:14:59,934
He really is.

394
00:15:01,554 --> 00:15:02,753
Oh, um, but don't just thank me.

395
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:04,088
You can pay me back by, um,

396
00:15:04,106 --> 00:15:06,424
helping me pick
a centerpiece arrangement.

397
00:15:06,442 --> 00:15:07,925
Sure.
Yeah?

398
00:15:07,943 --> 00:15:10,361
Option number one,

399
00:15:10,396 --> 00:15:11,563
or...

400
00:15:11,597 --> 00:15:12,597
option number two.

401
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,650
I'd go with the white one,

402
00:15:15,701 --> 00:15:16,934
because blue

403
00:15:16,952 --> 00:15:18,403
is like the color of sad,

404
00:15:18,437 --> 00:15:20,104
and white

405
00:15:20,122 --> 00:15:22,106
is the color of pure, like you.

406
00:15:22,124 --> 00:15:23,708
That's exactly what I thought.

407
00:15:23,742 --> 00:15:26,461
I'm gonna mark this
off my list.

408
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,117
(bell rings)

409
00:15:34,637 --> 00:15:37,121
And I didn't even have to

410
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:38,456
lay out a line of cereal

411
00:15:38,474 --> 00:15:39,957
for you to find me.

412
00:15:39,975 --> 00:15:41,292
I thought you loved Brittany.

413
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,760
I mean, I can't
believe you're making

414
00:15:42,794 --> 00:15:44,345
what's going on
with me and her about you.

415
00:15:44,396 --> 00:15:46,464
You're naive to think
that this isn't about me.

416
00:15:46,482 --> 00:15:48,016
I broke up with Brittany.

417
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:49,234
This is just her revenge.

418
00:15:49,268 --> 00:15:50,351
She could have

419
00:15:50,402 --> 00:15:52,353
dated anyone, boy or girl.

420
00:15:52,404 --> 00:15:54,805
But no. She chose you.

421
00:15:54,823 --> 00:15:57,108
The one person she
knew would send.

422
00:15:59,411 --> 00:16:00,578
Okay, you know what?
Brittany doesn't

423
00:16:00,613 --> 00:16:02,247
understand revenge.
Brittany is love.

424
00:16:02,281 --> 00:16:03,814
Listen up, Lipsy McChapstick.

425
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:05,250
This is going to end.

426
00:16:05,284 --> 00:16:07,202
Soon as Brittany
realizes that you are

427
00:16:07,253 --> 00:16:09,220
the most boring human being
on the planet,

428
00:16:09,238 --> 00:16:11,722
and that your impressions suck.
And then what?

429
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,942
You're... you're going
to date her again?

430
00:16:13,993 --> 00:16:15,410
Long distance?

431
00:16:15,444 --> 00:16:17,728
It didn't work, you
said it yourself.

432
00:16:17,746 --> 00:16:19,914
One step at a time.
First, I'm gonna

433
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:22,083
cut off the Sam-sized tumor
on her heart,

434
00:16:22,117 --> 00:16:24,619
and then we can begin
the long, slow process

435
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,571
of cleaning the stink
of your mediocrity off of her.

436
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:30,458
I'm not letting her go
without a fight.

437
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:32,910
What do you think
we're here for?

438
00:16:32,928 --> 00:16:36,747
To fight?
I'm not hitting a girl.

439
00:16:36,765 --> 00:16:39,083
Who said anything about hitting?

440
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:40,635
("Make No Mistake, She's Mine"
begins playing)

441
00:16:40,686 --> 00:16:44,472

Look, I know
you're still into her.

462
00:18:38,137 --> 00:18:39,637
You can't sing like that

463
00:18:39,671 --> 00:18:41,422
about somebody you don't love.

464
00:18:41,473 --> 00:18:42,924
But she's with me now,

465
00:18:42,975 --> 00:18:45,042
and you know that's
the best thing for her.

466
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:45,977
Just let it go.

467
00:18:48,647 --> 00:18:50,064
Never.

468
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,768

Hey, Bling-bling.

00:19:27,302 --> 00:19:29,187
Feeling better? Hey, X-Tina.
No, I am not.

486
00:19:29,221 --> 00:19:30,638
It's worse.

487
00:19:30,689 --> 00:19:32,306
My whole head feels like it's

488
00:19:32,357 --> 00:19:33,808
a shrink-wrapped
fist of ham.

489
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:35,309
Here, I got you this.

490
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,862
It's VapoRub.
My nana swears by it.

491
00:19:37,896 --> 00:19:39,947
Aw, thanks, lady.

492
00:19:39,982 --> 00:19:42,450
(chuckles) You're so sweet.

493
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,204
What, what'd I say?

494
00:19:46,238 --> 00:19:48,039
I don't want to be sweet.

495
00:19:48,073 --> 00:19:49,874
I want to be the girl
that kicks in the door

496
00:19:49,908 --> 00:19:51,125
and makes demands

497
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,627
and gets what she wants.

498
00:19:52,661 --> 00:19:53,944
But let's be honest:

499
00:19:53,962 --> 00:19:56,047
No one thinks "diva"
and pictures me.

500
00:19:56,081 --> 00:19:57,799
What are you talking about?

501
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,783
There are tons of
badass Asian divas.

502
00:19:59,802 --> 00:20:01,052
Look at Lucy Liu,

503
00:20:01,086 --> 00:20:03,004
Bai Ling, B.D. Wong.

504
00:20:03,055 --> 00:20:05,306
(sniffles) Okay, (coughs)

505
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,308
you're coming to my house
after school tonight,

506
00:20:07,342 --> 00:20:08,459
and we're gonna find
you the right song.

507
00:20:08,477 --> 00:20:09,894
We're gonna bring out your

508
00:20:09,928 --> 00:20:11,562
inner diva if it kills me.

509
00:20:11,597 --> 00:20:13,981
Aw, Blainey Days.

510
00:20:17,503 --> 00:20:19,304
(music playing softly)

511
00:20:22,508 --> 00:20:24,892
(Blaine coughs)

512
00:20:24,927 --> 00:20:27,762
Have you ever been with a girl?

513
00:20:27,813 --> 00:20:29,213
No.

514
00:20:29,231 --> 00:20:30,982
Perfect gold star gay.

515
00:20:31,016 --> 00:20:32,650
Except for that one time
where I kissed Rachel Berry.

516
00:20:32,685 --> 00:20:34,068
That doesn't count.

517
00:20:34,103 --> 00:20:35,603
Well, it's not that
I don't like girls.

518
00:20:35,654 --> 00:20:37,155
I love them.

519
00:20:37,189 --> 00:20:38,273
They're very kind
and sensitive,

520
00:20:38,324 --> 00:20:40,608
and their bodies are beautiful.

521
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:42,893
Thank you. You know,
on behalf of girls everywhere.

522
00:20:42,911 --> 00:20:46,114
But loving them that way...

523
00:20:46,165 --> 00:20:47,248
it's not who I am.

524
00:20:47,283 --> 00:20:48,583
We're young.

525
00:20:48,617 --> 00:20:49,784
We still have time
to find ourselves.

526
00:20:49,835 --> 00:20:51,119
Exactly.

527
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,903
Which is why,
Ms. Tina Cohen-Chang,

528
00:20:52,921 --> 00:20:55,089
you are about to find
your inner diva.

529
00:20:55,124 --> 00:20:56,841
I took the liberty
of making you a little

530
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,259
playlist of some
of the classic diva songs

531
00:20:58,294 --> 00:20:59,260
for you to go through,

532
00:20:59,295 --> 00:21:00,578
but you should open the laptop...

533
00:21:00,596 --> 00:21:01,796
I don't want to give you
my germs.

534
00:21:05,184 --> 00:21:06,601
Wow.

535
00:21:06,635 --> 00:21:09,270
I can't believe
you went old-school diva.

536
00:21:09,305 --> 00:21:12,023
Cher, Aretha, Madonna.

537
00:21:12,057 --> 00:21:13,691
Do you really think
I can pull this off?

538
00:21:13,726 --> 00:21:15,276
I don't even know
what I would wear.

539
00:21:15,311 --> 00:21:17,445
Are you kidding me?
You would kill it.

540
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:18,863
I was thinking
that we could use...

541
00:21:18,897 --> 00:21:19,947
(yawning):
One of those

542
00:21:19,982 --> 00:21:22,266
dresses from Sectionals.

543
00:21:22,284 --> 00:21:25,370
I'm sorry,
that-that cold medicine

544
00:21:25,404 --> 00:21:27,205
is really very strong.

545
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:29,106
Why don't you lie down?
Okay.

546
00:21:29,124 --> 00:21:31,159
It's a good idea.

547
00:21:33,162 --> 00:21:35,546
(sighs)

548
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,284
You know, I've been reading
a lot about divas.

549
00:21:40,302 --> 00:21:41,886
Mm-hmm.

550
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,971
And the biggest thing is

551
00:21:44,006 --> 00:21:46,674
that they're brutally honest.

552
00:21:46,709 --> 00:21:51,629
And if I'm...
going to be a diva, then...

553
00:21:51,647 --> 00:21:54,232
I have to be honest, too.

554
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:57,485
Totally.

555
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:00,137
Blaine...

556
00:22:00,155 --> 00:22:02,657
I'm falling in love with you.

557
00:22:04,326 --> 00:22:07,812
And I realize that this...

558
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:12,583
could be a tragic,
one-way thing.

559
00:22:12,618 --> 00:22:15,586
But even if we end up

560
00:22:15,621 --> 00:22:20,174
having just...
a sexless relationship,

561
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:22,710
which many Asian girls
and gay men do...

562
00:22:22,761 --> 00:22:24,345
(laughs)

563
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,798
...it'd be worth it.

564
00:22:29,134 --> 00:22:31,719
So please say something here
before I die.

565
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,504
(laughs)

566
00:22:33,522 --> 00:22:35,523
Blaine?

567
00:22:51,874 --> 00:22:54,242
(snoring softly)

568
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,846
(snoring softly)

569
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:30,278
(sniffles)

570
00:23:45,544 --> 00:23:47,128
MAN:
Right over there.

571
00:23:47,179 --> 00:23:49,079
Guys, gather some chairs up.

572
00:23:49,097 --> 00:23:50,681
Make a semicircle.

573
00:23:50,716 --> 00:23:52,934
Oh, we have five minutes.

574
00:23:56,138 --> 00:23:58,606
Welcome to Midnight Madness.

575
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,274
We all know the rules.

576
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:02,143
One song at a time, two singers

577
00:24:02,194 --> 00:24:06,113
per song. If you
go flat, you lose.

578
00:24:06,148 --> 00:24:08,816
Now, the playing space
has been split into two.

579
00:24:08,867 --> 00:24:10,151
One side per competitor.

580
00:24:10,202 --> 00:24:12,370
After the song,

581
00:24:12,404 --> 00:24:14,121
I will give you the signal,

582
00:24:14,156 --> 00:24:16,106
and you stand
with whoever you think won.

583
00:24:16,124 --> 00:24:17,792
Majority rules.

584
00:24:17,826 --> 00:24:20,962
The group's decision
is final. No appeal.

585
00:24:20,996 --> 00:24:24,382
No mercy,
and only silent applause.

586
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:26,801
This is not a performance.

587
00:24:26,835 --> 00:24:29,220
This is a blood sport.

588
00:24:29,254 --> 00:24:31,506
First up:

589
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:33,224
Rachel Berry versus Kurt Hummel.

590
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:43,968
Now, the song
you will be competing with

591
00:24:43,986 --> 00:24:45,820
is "Bring Him Home,"
from <i>Les Miz.</i>

592
00:24:45,854 --> 00:24:47,855
You guys know it?
Mm-hmm.

593
00:24:47,906 --> 00:24:49,824
Per Midnight Madness protocol,

594
00:24:49,858 --> 00:24:51,576
since Kurt challenged Rachel,

595
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:54,662
he will be going first.

596
00:24:56,865 --> 00:24:59,584
("Bring Him Home" begins)

597
00:25:08,677 --> 00:25:10,677
♪ God on high

598
00:25:16,718 --> 00:25:23,724

00:28:28,376 --> 00:28:29,744
Thank you.

631
00:28:29,795 --> 00:28:31,962
Okay, make your choice.

632
00:28:39,671 --> 00:28:42,056
All right.

633
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,225
And the winner
by the closest margin

634
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:47,812
in Midnight Madness history

635
00:28:47,846 --> 00:28:49,146
is Mr. Kurt Hummel.

636
00:28:49,181 --> 00:28:50,981
(laughs)

637
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:54,185
(laughs)

638
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,993
(school bell rings) What is
with you Glee Club ex-pats?

639
00:29:02,027 --> 00:29:03,611
Don't any of you have jobs?

640
00:29:03,662 --> 00:29:05,630
You have to have some source
of income

641
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,715
so you can pay the
staff of scientists

642
00:29:07,766 --> 00:29:10,601
who service your teleporters
that you all clearly own,

643
00:29:10,636 --> 00:29:12,804
since you're constantly
showing up here.

644
00:29:12,838 --> 00:29:15,005
I have a light schedule
this semester.

645
00:29:15,024 --> 00:29:17,508
Do you not remember
who got you that scholarship

646
00:29:17,543 --> 00:29:19,227
to Louisville?
Your coach is

647
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:20,645
sending me weekly reports,

648
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:22,230
and you dropped out a month ago.

649
00:29:22,281 --> 00:29:23,681
I'm sorry.
I hated it there.

650
00:29:23,699 --> 00:29:25,233
Everyone thought
that I was being a bitch

651
00:29:25,284 --> 00:29:26,951
when all I was doing
was being brutally honest

652
00:29:26,985 --> 00:29:29,120
with people. Look,
please don't tell my mom.

653
00:29:29,154 --> 00:29:30,671
Oh, I can't.
I don't speak Spanish.

654
00:29:30,706 --> 00:29:32,356
Let's face facts.

655
00:29:32,374 --> 00:29:33,741
I need an heir apparent,

656
00:29:33,792 --> 00:29:35,293
and I need someone
as mean as I am.

657
00:29:35,327 --> 00:29:37,361
Wait. So,
are you offering me a job?

658
00:29:37,396 --> 00:29:39,029
Finn Hudson took over
the Glee Club.

659
00:29:39,048 --> 00:29:40,665
Why can't you take over
my Cheerios!?

660
00:29:40,699 --> 00:29:42,667
Besides, you've always been
my favorite.

661
00:29:42,701 --> 00:29:44,034
This is an amazing offer.

662
00:29:44,053 --> 00:29:45,470
And with the money
that my mom gave me

663
00:29:45,504 --> 00:29:46,754
for New York, I could buy

664
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:48,656
a McMansion in Lima Heights.

665
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:51,175
And plus,
I'd be close to Brittany.

666
00:29:51,209 --> 00:29:53,261
Well, why don't you let me
know by the end of the week?

667
00:29:53,312 --> 00:29:55,012
I have Paula Abdul coming in
to interview as a backup,

668
00:29:55,046 --> 00:29:56,431
and whenever I cancel
too late with her,

669
00:29:56,482 --> 00:29:57,815
she tends to hit the pills.

670
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:01,686
(bell ringing)

671
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,021
(quiet, indistinct voices,
distorted sound)

672
00:30:08,327 --> 00:30:10,778
Amazing. Tay-tay,
I was just telling Artie

673
00:30:10,829 --> 00:30:12,280
how awesome I thought...

674
00:30:12,331 --> 00:30:14,165
Would you excuse us, please, Artie?
But, uh...

675
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:16,584
Oh.

676
00:30:18,036 --> 00:30:19,787
Is everything okay?

677
00:30:19,838 --> 00:30:21,506
Oh, the chicken soup
you made me... magic.

678
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,874
I feel great today!

679
00:30:22,908 --> 00:30:24,292
You want to know why?
Because of me.

680
00:30:24,343 --> 00:30:25,877
Because I took care of you.
Oh, and I guess

681
00:30:25,911 --> 00:30:27,795
I used most of this.
I don't know how that happened,

682
00:30:27,846 --> 00:30:29,380
but it's all gone. Sorry.

683
00:30:30,766 --> 00:30:33,217
Wait. Are you mad?
Look,

684
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:35,636
I give you all
of my heart, gladly.

685
00:30:35,687 --> 00:30:37,555
And I love hanging
out with you, Blaine.

686
00:30:37,589 --> 00:30:39,190
I love...

687
00:30:39,224 --> 00:30:41,526
It's sad because you don't see

688
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,094
that it's me that
gives you that support.

689
00:30:43,128 --> 00:30:44,479
Why are you acting
so pissed off?

690
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,230
Because I get it now.

691
00:30:46,264 --> 00:30:47,732
A diva doesn't settle for less
than what she wants,

692
00:30:47,766 --> 00:30:49,233
and she won't apologize
for wanting it.

693
00:30:49,267 --> 00:30:50,701
And I can't get that here,
so next time,

694
00:30:50,736 --> 00:30:52,069
don't come crawling back to me.

695
00:30:52,103 --> 00:30:53,538
I'm all out of soup.

696
00:30:53,572 --> 00:30:56,874
That seems a little... crazy.

697
00:30:56,909 --> 00:30:58,826
No.

698
00:30:58,877 --> 00:31:01,996
That seems a little
Tina Cohen-Chang. Respect.

FINN:
Tina.

742
00:33:23,021 --> 00:33:24,088
EMMA: Wow.
FINN: Wow.

743
00:33:24,106 --> 00:33:25,389
(cheering, whooping) I just...

744
00:33:25,423 --> 00:33:26,357
I can't even...

745
00:33:26,391 --> 00:33:27,725
That was the most...

746
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:29,226
Don't even worry about it.

747
00:33:30,696 --> 00:33:32,530
FINN (laughs):
Okay.

748
00:33:32,564 --> 00:33:34,431
Feel that fire.

749
00:33:34,449 --> 00:33:35,766
I've been singing
the <i>Les Miz</i> score

750
00:33:35,784 --> 00:33:36,934
since I was in second grade.

751
00:33:36,952 --> 00:33:38,235
Literally the entire score.

752
00:33:38,269 --> 00:33:40,538
It was just dumb luck that that
was the song that got chosen.

753
00:33:40,572 --> 00:33:41,989
I know you feel conflicted
about winning,

754
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,607
but you won because
you're an incredible singer.

755
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:45,042
Oh, my God, Kurt.

756
00:33:45,077 --> 00:33:46,661
Everyone is buzzing about your
triumph at Midnight Madness.

757
00:33:46,712 --> 00:33:48,946
Not since Judy played the
Palace, they're saying.

758
00:33:48,964 --> 00:33:51,115
A bunch of us are signing up
for the <i>Funny Girl</i> open call,

759
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:53,417
then getting rush tickets
to see <i>Mamma Mia!</i>

760
00:33:53,451 --> 00:33:54,552
You have to come with.

761
00:33:54,586 --> 00:33:56,787
I don't think so.

762
00:33:56,805 --> 00:33:58,339
I think you both
are shallow and obnoxious.

763
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:00,257
And I think the only reason
why you run around

764
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:02,009
kissing everyone's ass
is because you know

765
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,060
you'll never make it
on your own.

766
00:34:03,095 --> 00:34:04,395
And another thing.

767
00:34:04,429 --> 00:34:06,564
If you say one more nasty thing
about Adam's Apples,

768
00:34:06,598 --> 00:34:09,016
I will challenge you
to the next Midnight Madness,

769
00:34:09,067 --> 00:34:11,068
and we all know how that ends.

770
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,807
That's very impressive.

771
00:34:18,944 --> 00:34:21,645
Um, give me a second.

772
00:34:21,663 --> 00:34:23,614
Hey, Rachel.

773
00:34:23,648 --> 00:34:25,082
I don't know if you heard,
but apparently the revival

774
00:34:25,117 --> 00:34:26,650
of <i>Funny Girl</i> is having
open auditions.

775
00:34:26,668 --> 00:34:27,818
Do you want to go with me?

776
00:34:27,836 --> 00:34:29,486
You should try out, Kurt.

777
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:32,322
You'd be an amazing
Fanny Brice.

778
00:34:33,992 --> 00:34:36,093
(sighs)

779
00:34:38,651 --> 00:34:42,113
Winning dinner for two
at Red Rooster Express Suites...

780
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:44,416
FINN: The First Annual William
McKinley High School.

781
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,651
Diva Award goes to...

782
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:48,753
If it's Santana, I swear...

783
00:34:48,788 --> 00:34:51,489
(drumroll)

784
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:53,458
BOTH:
Tina Cohen-Chang!

785
00:34:53,492 --> 00:34:56,928
(cheering, whooping)

786
00:34:56,963 --> 00:34:58,830
(excited chattering)

787
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:03,218
She never wins anything.

788
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:06,221
(cheering continues)

789
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:07,973
(whooping) Tina!

790
00:35:08,007 --> 00:35:10,174
Tina!
Tina!

791
00:35:10,193 --> 00:35:13,445
(whooping, cheering)

792
00:35:13,479 --> 00:35:15,146
(bell ringing)

793
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:18,066
(clears throat)

794
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:21,786
Uh, no diva performance
is complete without flowers.

795
00:35:21,821 --> 00:35:23,154
Oh, how sweet.

796
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:24,623
Literally.

797
00:35:24,657 --> 00:35:26,408
Well, no one deserved to win
this week more than you.

798
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:27,742
I've been waiting
for people to finally see

799
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:30,245
the epic diva that
is Ms. Tina Cohen-Chang.

800
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:31,746
(chuckles softly)

801
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:34,966
I also owe you an apology.

802
00:35:35,001 --> 00:35:37,502
I'm sorry if I've been
ungrateful this week.

803
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:38,920
The truth is, I wouldn't have
survived it without you.

804
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:40,338
That little
cold buster kit you made me,

805
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:42,090
it not only annihilated my cold,

806
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:45,176
but it made me realize
that you are

807
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:48,013
the most important person to me
at this school right now.

808
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:52,684
And I haven't felt this close
to anyone in a long time.

809
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:56,554
You have no idea how long I've
waited to hear you say that.

810
00:35:56,572 --> 00:35:59,724
I have a proposition for you.

811
00:35:59,742 --> 00:36:02,994
Will you be my date to
Mr. Shue's wedding next week?

812
00:36:03,029 --> 00:36:04,446
Yes.

813
00:36:04,497 --> 00:36:06,081
(laughs) Of course.

814
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:10,669
(bell ringing)

815
00:36:13,506 --> 00:36:15,173
Shiva is officially over.

816
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:16,574
You have an audition
for <i>Funny Girl</i>

817
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:17,876
three weeks from today.

818
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:20,178
I went down to the open call
and got us the last slots.

819
00:36:20,212 --> 00:36:22,246
I'm not trying out.

820
00:36:22,265 --> 00:36:24,633
Why, because I won
Midnight Madness?

821
00:36:24,684 --> 00:36:26,718
Rachel, it doesn't mean anything...
it just means that we're even.

822
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:29,521
You won with an Elphaba song,
I won with a Jean Valjean song.

823
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:30,872
None of which changes the fact
that <i>Funny Girl</i>

824
00:36:30,906 --> 00:36:32,390
is your favorite musical,

825
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:34,693
and that you were born
to play Fanny Brice.

826
00:36:34,727 --> 00:36:36,861
This is a once-in-a lifetime
opportunity.

827
00:36:36,896 --> 00:36:38,647
Let's say by some crazy
extraordinary chance I get it.

828
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:40,264
Then what?

829
00:36:40,283 --> 00:36:43,267
I become even more of a diva
nightmare than I already am now?

830
00:36:43,286 --> 00:36:45,654
I can't handle the
pressures of stardom,

831
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:46,988
not without losing my
best friend and making

832
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,439
every single person hate me.

833
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:50,909
So I'm not going to try out.

834
00:36:50,943 --> 00:36:54,162
You are a diva,

835
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:56,114
and you have been a nightmare,

836
00:36:56,132 --> 00:36:57,749
but you're not a diva
because you've been a nightmare.

837
00:36:57,783 --> 00:37:01,252
You're a diva because
you're talented and ambitious

838
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:02,587
and because no one else
in the world

839
00:37:02,621 --> 00:37:04,923
can do what you, Rachel Berry,
can do.

840
00:37:04,957 --> 00:37:06,341
That's what being
a diva's all about.

841
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:08,043
Being an original,
one-of-a-kind.

842
00:37:08,077 --> 00:37:10,679
So hold the nightmare,
but bring the diva.

843
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,564
You don't need any of that.

844
00:37:12,598 --> 00:37:15,266
Your work speaks for itself.

845
00:37:15,301 --> 00:37:17,268
I love you.

846
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:18,770
I'm sorry.

847
00:37:18,804 --> 00:37:21,639
I hate fighting with you.

848
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:23,641
Eh, a little catfight
is good for friends.

849
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:26,277
You know,
keeps the relationship fresh.

850
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:27,812
(bell ringing)

851
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:32,033
I thought we already
checked this box.

852
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:34,786
Will said the white centerpiece
arrangements we picked were fine.

853
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,454
Which means
he doesn't like them.

854
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:39,824
And he'd like to veto them,
but he's just being polite.

855
00:37:39,842 --> 00:37:41,426
Um, "fine" doesn't mean

856
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,712
that he didn't like
the centerpieces.

857
00:37:43,763 --> 00:37:46,097
I need things to be more
than fine.

858
00:37:46,132 --> 00:37:47,716
Okay, I-I need them
to be perfect.

859
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:49,934
They have to be perfect
and I need them to be perfect.

860
00:37:49,969 --> 00:37:51,720
Look, I think you're just
putting too much into this.

861
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:53,972
No, I'm not, because the last
time, with Carl, I let go.

862
00:37:54,006 --> 00:37:55,223
I did that already, you know,

863
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:56,975
I said that details
wouldn't matter,

864
00:37:57,009 --> 00:37:58,610
that my-my OCD
wouldn't get in the way,

865
00:37:58,644 --> 00:38:00,445
that whatever would happen
would happen,

866
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:03,815
and that marriage was completely
ruined before it even began.

867
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:06,484
Maybe Carl just wasn't the right guy.
This isn't right.

868
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:08,153
I can't do this.

869
00:38:08,187 --> 00:38:10,572
I can't do this.
I can't get married again.

870
00:38:10,623 --> 00:38:12,323
I can't do it again
if it's not right.

871
00:38:12,357 --> 00:38:13,625
Miss Pillsbury, please.

872
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:15,577
What about the color white? What
if Will hates the color white?

873
00:38:15,628 --> 00:38:16,961
Then he's going
to hate my dress.

874
00:38:16,996 --> 00:38:19,831
Of course he's not going
to hate your dress, okay?

875
00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:22,533
What about the cake? Not
even tried the cake yet.

876
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:23,585
Okay, we make a great team.

877
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:25,086
We can figure
this out together.

878
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:27,371
Emma, stop. Stop. Stop.

879
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:38,049
(shuttered gasps)

880
00:38:38,067 --> 00:38:39,567
(bell ringing)

881
00:38:44,251 --> 00:38:46,602
I knew you'd come
around eventually.

882
00:38:46,637 --> 00:38:49,421
I mean, Sam's most
redeeming quality

883
00:38:49,439 --> 00:38:51,390
is that he can
bore you to sleep

884
00:38:51,424 --> 00:38:53,759
and then you can use his lips
as ginormous pillows.

885
00:38:53,777 --> 00:38:55,528
I'm not breaking up with Sam.

886
00:38:55,562 --> 00:38:56,863
I really like him.

887
00:38:56,897 --> 00:38:58,564
And he makes me feel
really smart

888
00:38:58,598 --> 00:39:00,449
and think about things,
like where air comes from,

889
00:39:00,484 --> 00:39:03,619
and how come in every movie
about Jesus he dies at the end.

890
00:39:03,654 --> 00:39:05,538
Well, look, I'm not expecting
you to start dating me again.

891
00:39:05,572 --> 00:39:07,974
I'm... I'm taken.

892
00:39:10,077 --> 00:39:11,410
I just want you to aim higher.

893
00:39:14,248 --> 00:39:16,883
I know that
you're not dating Elaine.

894
00:39:16,917 --> 00:39:18,885
She told me that you paid
her with scratcher tickets

895
00:39:18,919 --> 00:39:21,137
and an Ani DiFranco T-shirt to
pretend to be your girlfriend.

896
00:39:21,171 --> 00:39:23,389
And I also know that you
dropped out of school.

897
00:39:23,423 --> 00:39:26,058
Well, I'm moving on up.

898
00:39:26,093 --> 00:39:28,060
Sue offered me a job to train
to take over the Cheerios

899
00:39:28,095 --> 00:39:29,312
after she dies.

900
00:39:29,346 --> 00:39:30,496
You can't do that.

901
00:39:30,531 --> 00:39:31,764
Why? I mean, it's not like

902
00:39:31,798 --> 00:39:33,049
I'd have to wait that long.

903
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:34,166
I'm totally going to ricin her
protein shakes

904
00:39:34,201 --> 00:39:35,301
in a couple years.

905
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:36,602
I think you need to be somewhere

906
00:39:36,636 --> 00:39:38,137
that's as big
and as hot as you are.

907
00:39:38,155 --> 00:39:40,106
It's okay to follow
your dreams.

908
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,474
No, Brittany, you...
you have no idea

909
00:39:42,492 --> 00:39:44,476
what it's like out there
in the real world.

910
00:39:44,494 --> 00:39:46,412
No one gives a damn about you.

911
00:39:46,446 --> 00:39:47,663
Rachel found a new guy.

912
00:39:47,698 --> 00:39:49,949
And I hear Kurt did, too.

913
00:39:49,983 --> 00:39:52,285
Why shouldn't you get the
chance to be around people

914
00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:54,453
who are like you,
who appreciate you?

915
00:39:54,487 --> 00:39:56,839
Be a part of a community?

916
00:39:56,874 --> 00:39:58,841
Why can't you have
a real girlfriend?

917
00:39:58,876 --> 00:40:00,960
But not a best friend 'cause
that part's already taken.

918
00:40:07,667 --> 00:40:10,636
You really are genius,
Brittany.

919
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,805
(chuckles) Duh.

920
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:15,074
And you're my best friend.

921
00:40:20,013 --> 00:40:22,281
Sam and I are going
to Breadstix tonight

922
00:40:22,316 --> 00:40:24,317
to pretend to be British.
Do you want to come?

923
00:40:24,351 --> 00:40:26,819
No, thanks.

924
00:40:26,853 --> 00:40:29,155
I think I'm going to hang around
here a minute more.

925
