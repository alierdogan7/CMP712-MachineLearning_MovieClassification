Shalom, blogosphere.

00:00:01,863 --> 00:00:03,397
Jacob Ben Israel here
at McKinley High.

00:00:03,481 --> 00:00:05,949
"Sudden Death"
big stakes senior year--

4
00:00:06,017 --> 00:00:09,686
who will succeed
and who will fail?

5
00:00:09,737 --> 00:00:11,905
Finn Hudson,
mediocre quarterback,

6
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,824
mediocre Glee Club lead.

7
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:16,026
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

8
00:00:16,077 --> 00:00:18,045
Me? Uh...

9
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:19,997
Yeah, I have plans.

10
00:00:20,048 --> 00:00:21,248
(bell ringing)
Um...

11
00:00:21,332 --> 00:00:22,966
My mom still hasn't decided

12
00:00:23,034 --> 00:00:24,718
if I'm going to Harvard
or Stanford yet.

13
00:00:24,802 --> 00:00:26,219
And where are you applying?

14
00:00:26,304 --> 00:00:27,871
I'm not.
I'm only a junior.

15
00:00:27,922 --> 00:00:29,306
Senior, junior, junior.

16
00:00:29,373 --> 00:00:30,424
Hello.

17
00:00:30,508 --> 00:00:32,426
Huh. I thought
you were a senior.

18
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:33,977
Optical illusion.

19
00:00:34,045 --> 00:00:36,063
The chair adds a year.

20
00:00:36,147 --> 00:00:37,597
Uh...

21
00:00:37,682 --> 00:00:40,567
(singing scales):
* Me, me, me, me, me, me, you *

22
00:00:40,652 --> 00:00:42,319
* Me, me, me, me, me, me... *

23
00:00:42,386 --> 00:00:43,487
I'm glad you asked.

24
00:00:43,554 --> 00:00:44,821
This year we'll
both be applying

25
00:00:44,889 --> 00:00:46,356
to a New York-based
performing arts school--

26
00:00:46,407 --> 00:00:47,607
(sneezes)
Juilliard.

27
00:00:47,692 --> 00:00:48,859
We'll get an eclectic
little apartment

28
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,110
on the Lower East Side...

29
00:00:50,194 --> 00:00:51,495
<i>Think Bette and Barbara
Hershey in Beaches,</i>

30
00:00:51,562 --> 00:00:52,996
pre-cardiomyopathy.

31
00:00:53,064 --> 00:00:54,414
I'll originate a role
in a new Sondheim musical;

32
00:00:54,499 --> 00:00:56,667
Tony by 25.
Married by 3

33
00:00:56,734 --> 00:00:58,085
* Leg-a-lly! *
Broadway, Lincoln Center,

34
00:00:58,169 --> 00:01:00,537
West End, a tasteful
HBO miniseries.

35
00:01:00,588 --> 00:01:02,422
It's all right here
in my planner, you see?

36
00:01:02,507 --> 00:01:04,741
Twitter says you're officially
dating Sam Evans,

37
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:08,095
AKA Trouty Mouth,
AKA Hobo McBieber.

38
00:01:08,179 --> 00:01:09,680
Honey, that is so June.

39
00:01:09,747 --> 00:01:12,215
Yeah, Sam and I dated, but
his dad got a job out of state.

40
00:01:12,266 --> 00:01:14,217
But I'm gonna give
you an exclusive:
Ooh.

41
00:01:14,268 --> 00:01:16,136
There's a new man
in Mercedes' life now,

42
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,854
and he's my future plans.

43
00:01:17,922 --> 00:01:19,606
I'm not your only
your future plans, baby.

44
00:01:19,691 --> 00:01:21,091
You're gonna be a star,

45
00:01:21,142 --> 00:01:23,060
and when you graduate
and win that first Grammy,

46
00:01:23,111 --> 00:01:24,945
we're gonna make
beautiful cocoa babies.

47
00:01:25,029 --> 00:01:28,315
Ooh, baby, how you talk.

48
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:30,233
Senior year is all about
being the Cheerios! top 'ho

49
00:01:30,284 --> 00:01:32,119
and modeling my fierceness

50
00:01:32,203 --> 00:01:34,821
after my numero uno
Latina: Paula Abdul.

51
00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:36,573
Paula Abdul is an Arab.

52
00:01:36,624 --> 00:01:38,325
Hey, has anyone seen
Quinn Fabray?

53
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:39,626
Hi.
Hi.

54
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:41,628
Ooh, Brittany, what are
your plans for the future?

55
00:01:41,713 --> 00:01:43,046
Wait.

56
00:01:43,114 --> 00:01:46,116
Are you working
on a time machine, too?

57
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:48,385
I'm really excited
about this year.

58
00:01:48,452 --> 00:01:51,121
Okay... cool.

59
00:01:51,172 --> 00:01:53,340
<i>FINN:
The truth is, I have no idea
what I'm doing.</i>

60

knows where they're headed</i>

61
00:01:55,309 --> 00:01:56,727
<i>or at least what they want.</i>

62
00:01:56,794 --> 00:01:58,311
<i>I'm lost.</i>

63
00:01:58,396 --> 00:02:00,847
<i>It's like I can't even
remember who I am anymore.</i>

65
00:02:03,851 --> 00:02:05,736

(both giggling)

72
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,867
Guess who woke up
right before I did?

73
00:02:20,952 --> 00:02:22,669
I haven't
brushed yet.

74
00:02:38,553 --> 00:02:40,554
(bell ringing)

75
00:02:40,638 --> 00:02:42,606
Mr. Shue, why are
all of our trophies

76
00:02:42,673 --> 00:02:44,391
in the middle
of the room?

77
00:02:44,475 --> 00:02:46,610
I was sure that our
Nationals trophy would
grow during the summer.

78
00:02:46,677 --> 00:02:48,228
I want this image burned
into your mind.

79
00:02:48,312 --> 00:02:49,362
This is what the difference

80
00:02:49,447 --> 00:02:50,614
between first

81
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:52,199
and 12th place looks like.

82
00:02:52,283 --> 00:02:54,117
It's also what it feels like.

83
00:02:54,185 --> 00:02:56,403
Are you planning on bumming us
out all year long?
No.

84
00:02:56,487 --> 00:02:57,704
I'm planning on
pushing you harder

85
00:02:57,789 --> 00:02:58,955
than you've ever
been pushed.

86
00:02:59,023 --> 00:03:01,357
We made it to Nationals
last year.

87
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:03,526
This year, I'm not going to let
anything or anyone

88
00:03:03,578 --> 00:03:06,296
stop us from winning it all;
I let you down last year.

89
00:03:06,363 --> 00:03:09,199
I lost focus, let some Broadway
pipe dream get in the way.

90
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,201
And we're really sorry
that the guy who replaced you

91
00:03:11,252 --> 00:03:12,869
in April Rhodes' musical
won the Tony.

92
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,370
I mean, I can only
imagine your regret.

93
00:03:14,422 --> 00:03:16,056
MERCEDES: Yeah, you
know what I regret?

94
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,842
Being the laughingstock
of the show choir world.

95
00:03:18,893 --> 00:03:20,477
And that's saying something.

96
00:03:20,544 --> 00:03:21,895
Mercedes has a point.

97
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:23,880
Finn and Rachel's
"The Kiss That Missed"

98
00:03:23,931 --> 00:03:25,315
already has 20,000
views on YouTube,

99
00:03:25,382 --> 00:03:27,050
and the comments section

100
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:29,069
is just full of
pithy banter like

101
00:03:29,153 --> 00:03:31,438
"Why is that T Rex
eating the Jew?"

102
00:03:31,522 --> 00:03:34,074
How many times do we
have to apologize?
Yeah.
No more apologies.

103
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:35,075
The school hates us
even more now.

104
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,493
Which is why we have to work

105
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,161
even harder this year
to recruit new members.

106
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:39,329
We're three men down.

107
00:03:39,396 --> 00:03:40,614
Yeah, only because Puckerman

108
00:03:40,698 --> 00:03:42,398
couldn't convince Zizes to stay.

109
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,951
What we had was hot, but after
the debacle of Nationals,

110
00:03:45,036 --> 00:03:46,419
the Glee Club is not,

111
00:03:46,504 --> 00:03:48,672
and my cool factor
can't withstand it,

112
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:50,507
all right?
My rep is in free fall.

113
00:03:50,574 --> 00:03:52,843
Oh, don't be sad.

114
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,427
We'll always have Subway.

115
00:03:54,512 --> 00:03:55,962
<i>PUCK:
She's the one that got away--</i>

116
00:03:56,047 --> 00:03:59,182
really, really slowly.

117
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,650
Where's Quinn?
ARTIE: MIA.

118
00:04:00,718 --> 00:04:02,219
No one's heard from her.

119
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,603
It's sad; I miss her.

120
00:04:03,688 --> 00:04:05,055
No one is going to join,
Mr. Shue.

121
00:04:05,106 --> 00:04:06,273
They will.

122
00:04:06,357 --> 00:04:07,757
All they need is a
little inspiration--

123
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,359
and I happen to have some,

124
00:04:09,426 --> 00:04:10,894
courtesy of Al Motta
of Motta's Pianos.

125
00:04:10,945 --> 00:04:12,095
Bring 'em in, guys!

126
00:04:12,146 --> 00:04:14,397
WILL: You guys are going
to love this.

127
00:04:14,448 --> 00:04:15,949
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

128
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:17,600
Okay, if there are
purple pianos

129
00:04:17,652 --> 00:04:20,103
involved in this,
I am on board.

130
00:04:20,154 --> 00:04:23,439
These pianos were repossessed
from foreclosed homes.

131
00:04:23,491 --> 00:04:25,825
They're cast-offs,
just like all of us.

132
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,678
Used, in need of repairs.

133
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:30,747
But they're still capable
of making beautiful music.

134
00:04:30,798 --> 00:04:33,216
WILL: Right. So Mr. Motta,
as a lover of the arts,

135
00:04:33,284 --> 00:04:35,719
agreed to donate them to Glee.

136
00:04:35,786 --> 00:04:37,304
I fixed them up,

137
00:04:37,388 --> 00:04:38,755
painted them purple,

138
00:04:38,806 --> 00:04:40,724
and The Purple Piano Project
was born.

139
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,977
Now, I'm going to be placing
these grapey uprights randomly

140
00:04:44,061 --> 00:04:45,929
throughout the school,
and whenever you see one,

141
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,314
no matter what you're doing,

142
00:04:47,398 --> 00:04:49,149
I want you to sing a song.

143
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:50,901
Now, use this assignment
to attract kids

144
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:52,769
who are just like you--

145
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,021
kids who can't
keep the music inside.

146
00:04:55,106 --> 00:04:56,773
Those are the kinds of additions

147
00:04:56,824 --> 00:04:59,075
that we need
to win it all this year.

148
00:04:59,143 --> 00:05:00,310
(sighs)
Now, for many of you,

149
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:02,645
this is your last year.

150
00:05:02,697 --> 00:05:04,080
Let's make it special.

151
00:05:04,148 --> 00:05:05,365
(bell ringing)

152
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:07,968
We have an important
announcement to make.

153
00:05:08,035 --> 00:05:09,485
I thought this day might come.

154
00:05:09,537 --> 00:05:11,254
Really, this is the only
dating combination

155
00:05:11,322 --> 00:05:12,839
that the Glee Club hasn't tried.

156
00:05:12,924 --> 00:05:14,090
We're not dating.

157
00:05:14,158 --> 00:05:16,659
Kurt and I will be auditioning
for Juilliard,

158
00:05:16,711 --> 00:05:18,511
the nation's premiere
performing arts school.

159
00:05:18,596 --> 00:05:20,180
That's a very good plan, guys.

160
00:05:20,264 --> 00:05:21,097
It's fabulous.

161
00:05:21,165 --> 00:05:22,849
Except Juilliard doesn't have

162
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:24,601
a musical theatre department.

163
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:28,305
Wait, what?

164
00:05:28,356 --> 00:05:30,673
Have you guys thought about
somewhere closer to home?

165
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:33,526
Kent State has a wonderful
musical theatre program

166
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:35,845
and a macabre backstory,
so if you're having a bad day

167
00:05:35,896 --> 00:05:38,481
or if you don't get the lead
in a musical, you can say

168
00:05:38,532 --> 00:05:40,700
to yourselves, "You know what?
Things really could be worse."

169
00:05:40,785 --> 00:05:43,119
No... No, thank you.

170
00:05:43,187 --> 00:05:45,455
No one ever became a star
by playing it safe.

171
00:05:45,522 --> 00:05:46,990
We're going to New York.

172
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:50,377
We are.
I think I have
the school for you.

173
00:05:50,461 --> 00:05:51,861
(drawer opens, then closes)

174
00:05:54,498 --> 00:05:55,999
NYADA?

175
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,634
New York Academy
for the Dramatic Arts.

176
00:05:57,701 --> 00:05:59,052
<i>US News and World Report</i>

177
00:05:59,136 --> 00:06:00,887
ranked them the number one
college in the nation

178
00:06:00,972 --> 00:06:02,055
for musical theatre.

179
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:03,306
It's really competitive,

180
00:06:03,374 --> 00:06:05,392
They only take about
20 students a year,

181
00:06:05,476 --> 00:06:08,228
but they do a regular mixer
for prospective students,

182
00:06:08,312 --> 00:06:10,397
and this year,
the Midwest's top talent

183
00:06:10,481 --> 00:06:12,548
is rubbing elbows at the Dayton
Doubletree on Thursday night.

184
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,652
You could go and check
out the competish!

185
00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:17,937
Yay! Yay, college!

186
00:06:18,022 --> 00:06:19,155
(bell rings)

187
00:06:19,223 --> 00:06:21,724
The poll numbers
are in, Coach.

188
00:06:21,776 --> 00:06:22,942
Close the door.

189
00:06:23,027 --> 00:06:24,694
Becky, the special election

190
00:06:24,745 --> 00:06:28,248
to fill Ken "Heart Attack"
Weigand's congressional seat

191
00:06:28,332 --> 00:06:33,837
is in two months, and I am
in ninth place at six percent,

192
00:06:33,904 --> 00:06:35,755
well behind "Undecided,"

193
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,407
that rapist running
from prison,

194
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,909
and "I don't care, please don't
call me during dinner."

195
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,630
<i>I thought the people wanted a
candidate who was for something.</i>

196
00:06:43,714 --> 00:06:46,216
That's why I took that
pro-deportation stance.

197
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:48,084
But the people are angry.

198
00:06:48,135 --> 00:06:49,886
They want a candidate

199
00:06:49,937 --> 00:06:52,022
who's against something.

200
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:54,424
What about toast?

201
00:06:54,475 --> 00:06:56,526
Bread's already been baked.

202
00:06:56,593 --> 00:06:59,062
I don't get why you
need to cook it again.

203
00:06:59,113 --> 00:07:02,432
Tsk. Oh, Becky, your
twisted genius excites me.

204
00:07:02,483 --> 00:07:05,652
That said, I'm on the
precipice of doom.

205
00:07:05,736 --> 00:07:09,489
I need to find something
everyone hates.

206
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:11,157
(sighs)

207
00:07:11,242 --> 00:07:12,826
(piano playing "Chopsticks"
in distance)

208
00:07:16,464 --> 00:07:18,331
("Chopsticks" playing loudly)

209
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,666
(slamming down keyboard lid)

210
00:07:21,785 --> 00:07:23,336
(cutters snipping)

211
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:24,721
(strings clattering to floor)

212
00:07:24,788 --> 00:07:26,256
Oh, I'm sorry.

213
00:07:26,307 --> 00:07:28,641
I just realized that song
might be the national anthem

214
00:07:28,726 --> 00:07:30,343
from whatever country
you're from.

215
00:07:30,428 --> 00:07:32,095
That's really offensive.

216
00:07:32,146 --> 00:07:36,399
You know, I was really humbled
when your Glee Club

217
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:40,186
made my sister's funeral
so very touching!

218
00:07:40,271 --> 00:07:44,190
In fact, I was so moved that
I have spent the entire year

219
00:07:44,275 --> 00:07:47,444
being nothing but kind
to you people.

220
00:07:47,495 --> 00:07:48,995
Today's only
the second day of school.

221
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,198
You have no right to disturb
the learning environment

222
00:07:52,283 --> 00:07:55,285
of this school by playing
your jangly national anthem

223
00:07:55,336 --> 00:07:56,652
on Liberace's piano.

224
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,157
Thank you.

225
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,492
You're welcome.

226
00:08:02,543 --> 00:08:04,344
I have no idea who you are.

227
00:08:04,428 --> 00:08:05,762
I'm Nancy Bletheim.

228
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:07,380
I teach geometry.

229
00:08:07,465 --> 00:08:09,048
I've been teaching
here for 42 years.

230
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:10,433
So awkward.

231
00:08:10,501 --> 00:08:11,718
Those artsy kids, they think

232
00:08:11,802 --> 00:08:13,269
they can get away with anything.

233
00:08:13,337 --> 00:08:15,105
People who call
themselves "artists"

234
00:08:15,172 --> 00:08:17,023
think the rules don't
apply to them.

235
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:18,391
It's so arrogant.

236
00:08:18,476 --> 00:08:20,360
Bless you, Sue Sylvester.

237
00:08:20,444 --> 00:08:21,611
You got my vote.

238
00:08:27,151 --> 00:08:28,518
You're quiet.

239
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:30,403
No. I'm being
passive-aggressive.

240
00:08:30,488 --> 00:08:32,522
You promised that by
the first day of school,

241
00:08:32,573 --> 00:08:33,856
you'd make a decision.

242
00:08:33,908 --> 00:08:37,860
And yet, there you
sit, cute as ever,

243
00:08:37,912 --> 00:08:39,295
but still in your
Warblers blazer.

244
00:08:39,363 --> 00:08:41,080
I can't just bail
on the Warblers.

245
00:08:41,165 --> 00:08:42,132
Those guys are my friends.

246
00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:43,133
Okay, all right, fine.

247
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,551
One final sales pitch,

248
00:08:44,635 --> 00:08:46,085
and then we can talk about
making over Nancy Grace.

249
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,086
Okay.

250
00:08:47,171 --> 00:08:49,389
If you stay at Dalton,

251
00:08:49,473 --> 00:08:52,809
you and I are competitors.

252
00:08:52,876 --> 00:08:53,626
That's true.

253
00:08:53,694 --> 00:08:55,845
And I'm just not sure

254
00:08:55,896 --> 00:08:58,181
that our budding love
can survive that.

255
00:08:58,232 --> 00:08:59,382
Let me get this straight.

256
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:01,651
I have to transfer

257
00:09:01,718 --> 00:09:03,436
because you're
just afraid that

258
00:09:03,521 --> 00:09:05,271
I'm going to beat
you at Sectionals?

259
00:09:05,356 --> 00:09:07,357
No, I'm afraid that
I'm going to beat you.
Ooh, ooh, yeah.

260
00:09:07,408 --> 00:09:10,160
And I know what that
does to you when I win.

261
00:09:10,227 --> 00:09:12,061
(laughing)

262
00:09:12,112 --> 00:09:13,830
Look, I mean,
honestly, I-I just...

263
00:09:13,898 --> 00:09:15,999
I just want to see you more.

264
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:18,168
Yeah, I want my senior
year to be magic,

265
00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:20,170
and the only way
that's gonna happen

266
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:23,506
is if I get to spend every
minute of every day with you.

267
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,964
(bell rings)

268
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:33,850
<i>QUINN: Senior year,
and I've finally found myself.</i>

269
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:36,302
<i>I'm not sure what
the tipping point was--</i>

270
00:09:36,387 --> 00:09:37,470
<i>dyeing my hair,</i>

271
00:09:37,555 --> 00:09:39,606
<i>the nose ring,</i>

272
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,641
<i>my ironic tattoo
of Ryan Seacrest--</i>

273
00:09:41,725 --> 00:09:45,528
<i>but one thing I know,
I'm never going back.</i>

274
00:09:45,596 --> 00:09:48,097
Quinn, look, this is our
senior year, and, frankly,

275
00:09:48,148 --> 00:09:50,149
being on the Cheerios!
isn't the same without you.

276
00:09:50,234 --> 00:09:53,453
You guys are such suckers for
going back to Coach Sylvester.

277
00:09:53,537 --> 00:09:56,289
Come on, screw her.
This is for us.

278
00:09:56,373 --> 00:09:58,441
We could win two national
championships this year.

279
00:09:58,492 --> 00:10:00,093
We joined the Cheerios!
together,

280
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,895
we joined Glee Club together,

281
00:10:01,962 --> 00:10:03,530
we all slept with Puckerman
the same year.

282
00:10:03,597 --> 00:10:05,131
Mm-hmm.
We're like
besties for life.

283
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:06,900
Yeah. Come on, Quinn.

284
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:09,068
You know, we used to be like
the Three Musketeers,

285
00:10:09,136 --> 00:10:11,704
and now Santana and I
are like Almond Joy,

286
00:10:11,772 --> 00:10:14,107
and you're like a Jolly Rancher
that fell in the ashtray.

287
00:10:14,174 --> 00:10:16,342
You guys never understood
the pressure I was under.

288
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,577
It sucked.

289
00:10:17,645 --> 00:10:19,112
I'm not interested
in the boys

290
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:21,681
or the makeup
or the polyester outfits.

291
00:10:21,749 --> 00:10:24,517
Look, I've got a bar of soap
and a bottle of peroxide

292
00:10:24,585 --> 00:10:27,353
with your name on it
in my locker.

293
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:30,757
Come on, Quinn, you can't
break up the unholy trinity.

294
00:10:30,824 --> 00:10:32,058
People grow apart.

295
00:10:32,126 --> 00:10:34,260
Deal with it.

296
00:10:34,328 --> 00:10:38,197
I've got new friends now, and
they accept me for who I am.

297
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,584
<i>QUINN:
We call ourselves "The Skanks."</i>

298
00:10:41,652 --> 00:10:42,452
I'm Sheila.

299
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,419
I'm Ronnie.

300
00:10:43,487 --> 00:10:44,921
They call me "The Mack"

301
00:10:44,989 --> 00:10:47,056
because I like to make out
with truckers at the rest stop.

302
00:10:47,124 --> 00:10:48,458
It's kind of
a double meaning thing.

303
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:49,892
I once ate cat poo.

304
00:10:52,563 --> 00:10:54,597
RACHEL:
Hey, Quinn.

305
00:10:54,665 --> 00:10:56,266
Hello... Skanks.

306
00:10:57,534 --> 00:10:59,402
Your friend stinks
of soap, Quinn.

307
00:11:00,971 --> 00:11:03,439
We were friends once.

308
00:11:03,507 --> 00:11:04,707
Okay? And maybe
when you cut off

309
00:11:04,775 --> 00:11:06,209
all your hair last
year and thought it

310
00:11:06,277 --> 00:11:07,710
would solve all your problems,
I should have spoken up.

311
00:11:07,778 --> 00:11:09,012
Maybe when you dropped out

312
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:10,546
of society this summer
and started dating

313
00:11:10,614 --> 00:11:12,081
that 40-year-old skateboarder,
I should have said...

314
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:13,816
I'm not coming back
to Glee Club.

315
00:11:13,884 --> 00:11:15,585
We need you. O-O-Okay?

316
00:11:15,653 --> 00:11:18,187
Have you seen those-those
purple pianos around school?

317
00:11:18,238 --> 00:11:20,790
We're planning this... this big,
you know, recruiting number,

318
00:11:20,857 --> 00:11:23,159
and it's going to be a tribute
to the Go-Go's.

319
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,328
I mean, who doesn't
love the Go-Go's?

320
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:26,963
I prefer the Bangles.

321
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,414
Okay.

322
00:11:28,499 --> 00:11:30,199
We need your...

323
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,136
your tremulous alto and your
Belinda Carlisle glamour.

324
00:11:33,203 --> 00:11:34,554
I'll give you ten bucks
if you let me

325
00:11:34,638 --> 00:11:35,555
beat her up
for you, Quinn.

326
00:11:35,623 --> 00:11:37,540
I'm sorry you're so sad, Quinn.

327
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:39,709
And... maybe you're not
going to believe me

328
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,260
because we were
never really close,

329
00:11:41,345 --> 00:11:43,563
but I'm sad not seeing
you in the choir room.

330
00:11:43,647 --> 00:11:46,516
And we've all been
through so much together.

331
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:49,268
We're a family, and this is
our year to get it right.

332
00:11:49,353 --> 00:11:52,322
We would love to have you
back in the Glee Club

333
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:54,324
whenever you're ready.

334
00:11:54,391 --> 00:11:56,225
Okay?

335
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:00,396
...making it the zoo's
bloodiest weekend

336
00:12:00,447 --> 00:12:02,415
in over six years.

337
00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:05,901
That's what I call
"panda-monium."

338
00:12:05,953 --> 00:12:08,204
Now let's hitch a ride
over to Sue's Corner

339
00:12:08,255 --> 00:12:10,089
with congressional candidate
Sue Sylvester.

340
00:12:10,174 --> 00:12:12,091
Take it away, Sue.

341
00:12:12,176 --> 00:12:13,960
(whistle blows)

342
00:12:14,044 --> 00:12:17,213
Western Ohio, ever since
the start of my campaign

343
00:12:17,264 --> 00:12:20,767
to replace Ken "My Heart Stopped
Beating and I Died" Weigand,

344
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:23,085
I've been trying to be positive.

345
00:12:23,137 --> 00:12:25,788
Well, you know what, Fourth
Congressional District?

346
00:12:25,856 --> 00:12:28,608
Unless it's a day she's
being screened for hepatitis,

347
00:12:28,692 --> 00:12:30,610
this gal's not positive.

348
00:12:30,694 --> 00:12:33,363
And you know what's
getting me down, Western Ohio?

349
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:36,282
The arts in public schools.

350
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:39,268
Why? Because America is failing.

351
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:42,438
China is on our ass, people.

352
00:12:42,489 --> 00:12:45,941
This isn't the 1960s anymore,
when jobs were plentiful.

353
00:12:45,993 --> 00:12:48,277
And it's not personal,
Will Schuester.

354
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:52,165
The arts are expensive,
and we can't afford it anymore.

355
00:12:52,249 --> 00:12:53,716
That's why, tonight,

356
00:12:53,784 --> 00:12:56,085
I'm making a pledge,
Fourth Congressional District.

357
00:12:56,153 --> 00:12:59,088
If you honor me by electing me
your representative,

358
00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:02,291
I will suspend all public school
arts programs,

359
00:13:02,342 --> 00:13:03,459
and reject all
You've got to
be kidding me.

360
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,511
federal and state
funding for the arts

361
00:13:05,596 --> 00:13:09,965
until every single student
reads at or above grade level.

362
00:13:10,017 --> 00:13:11,067
Until then, parents,

363
00:13:11,134 --> 00:13:12,802
if you'd like your teenager

364
00:13:12,853 --> 00:13:15,137
to join the Glee Club
or play a doorman

365
00:13:15,189 --> 00:13:17,473
in a boring four-hour play
about what it's like

366
00:13:17,524 --> 00:13:19,642
to be a middle-aged
gay New Yorker,

367
00:13:19,693 --> 00:13:22,144
feel free to pay for it
yourself.

368
00:13:22,196 --> 00:13:23,979
But until Ohio's kids

369
00:13:24,031 --> 00:13:27,250
can compete again, it won't be
on the taxpayer dime.

370
00:13:28,031 --> 00:13:31,191
And that's how Sue... sees it.

371
00:13:34,095 --> 00:13:34,105
+

372
00:13:35,407 --> 00:13:37,024
She can't do this!

373
00:13:37,075 --> 00:13:40,077
William, it's important you
don't take this so personally.

374
00:13:40,162 --> 00:13:42,280
First of all, Sue,
you ruined a piece

375
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:43,981
of private property.
Allegedly.

376
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:46,200
Also, you got
your facts all wrong.

377
00:13:46,251 --> 00:13:48,068
The arts help kids
do better in school.

378
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,288
Kids in the arts
record the lowest instance

379
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:51,572
of substance abuse.

380
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,257
Tell that to Janis Joplin.

381
00:13:53,342 --> 00:13:55,376
So you see, Sue,
I do take this personally.

382
00:13:55,427 --> 00:13:56,911
You're not just threatening
an arts program.

383
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:58,346
You're threatening
my livelihood.

384
00:13:58,413 --> 00:13:59,914
I need job security.

385
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,265
I'm in a
relationship now.

386
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,967
I-I'm... I'm thinking
about starting a family.

387
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,519
Oh, how is it going
with Emma?

388
00:14:04,586 --> 00:14:05,520
I'm sure everything
in the bedroom

389
00:14:05,587 --> 00:14:06,921
is just completely normal.

390
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:08,356
Yes!

391
00:14:08,423 --> 00:14:10,107
No. It's so frustrating.

392
00:14:10,192 --> 00:14:12,310
I get the green light,
and then the...

393
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:14,478
the red light comes
just as quickly.
William...

394
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,430
allow me to ladle you

395
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,817
a piping hot bowl
of "this is how it is."

396
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:21,869
I'm done squabbling
with you, okay?

397
00:14:21,937 --> 00:14:23,437
I'm on the
national stage

398
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,940
in the white-hot stare
of the public eye.

399
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:27,792
You know, ever since
my "Sue's Corner" last night,

400
00:14:27,876 --> 00:14:29,460
I've made tremendous gains
in the polls,

401
00:14:29,545 --> 00:14:30,828
and I'm neck and neck

402
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,496
with that rapist
running from prison.

403
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:34,615
So I got bigger
fish to fry

404
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,450
than you and your
little Glee Club.

405
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,319
So truce for now,
macaroni hair.

406
00:14:38,387 --> 00:14:40,137
Oh, and William,

407
00:14:40,222 --> 00:14:43,341
just know,
if you do anything to derail

408
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:46,510
my bullet train to power,
I'll destroy you.

409
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:48,479
(bell ringing)

410
00:14:48,564 --> 00:14:51,349
Ladies, I put plastic
on your chairs

411
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,568
in anticipation
of this announcement,

412
00:14:53,635 --> 00:14:56,854
so feel free to wet yourselves
with excitement.

413
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:59,407
You are my Cheerio co-captains.

414
00:14:59,474 --> 00:15:01,025
What?!
Wait. Co-captains?

415
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,827
With... No. No way. Uh-uh.

416
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,245
I can't work with her!

417
00:15:04,312 --> 00:15:05,830
Nah, nah, nah, see,
let me tell you how this

418
00:15:05,914 --> 00:15:06,981
gon' be, if I may.

419
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:08,165
When I look
at a person,

420
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,600
I don't see someone
who looks a certain way

421
00:15:09,668 --> 00:15:11,535
or has this or that amount
of chromosomes.

422
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,954
I just see someone

423
00:15:13,005 --> 00:15:14,488
who I may or may not
have to destroy.

424
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:15,940
So if you ever
tell me

425
00:15:16,008 --> 00:15:18,125
what to do, I will end you.

426
00:15:18,176 --> 00:15:19,794
Bring it, sandbags!

427
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:22,346
Ladies, I am aroused.

428
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:25,349
However, we have
a more pressing issue at hand.

429
00:15:25,434 --> 00:15:29,804
There are purple pianos
polluting this school,

430
00:15:29,855 --> 00:15:32,189
and I will seem weak

431
00:15:32,274 --> 00:15:34,976
if it appears I cannot control
my own workspace.

432
00:15:35,027 --> 00:15:38,312
I want you to track down those
pianos, take care of them.

433
00:15:38,363 --> 00:15:41,232
(snaps fingers)
Make it look like an accident.

434
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:44,819
Santana, you like
playing both sides.

435
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,570
Isn't that right?

436
00:15:46,638 --> 00:15:49,323
What team you playing
for this year?

437
00:15:49,374 --> 00:15:51,309
Losers or the winners?

438
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:55,296
Team Sue.

439
00:15:55,363 --> 00:15:57,415
Glad to hear it.

440
00:16:02,137 --> 00:16:04,221
Why are you guys ignoring
Mr. Schuester's assignment?

441
00:16:04,306 --> 00:16:05,389
Wait, is there

442
00:16:05,474 --> 00:16:06,540
a purple piano
in here?

443
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:07,675
Wow. How did any
of us miss that?

444
00:16:07,726 --> 00:16:09,260
Okay.
We have to do the number.

445
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:10,261
Okay?

446
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:11,712
We have to survive lunch.

447
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,347
It's not fair that Mr. Shue
put the piano in here.

448
00:16:13,398 --> 00:16:14,882
It's too much pressure.

449
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:17,234
I agree. That is like wearing
a red dress to a bullfight.

450
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:18,886
The point of the assignment
was to find people

451
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,104
who couldn't help
but join, okay?

452
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,605
The more people
that we sing in front of,

453
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,074
the more chances we have
of getting one.

454
00:16:23,158 --> 00:16:24,909
Okay?
It's simple mathematics.

455
00:16:24,993 --> 00:16:26,077
Which I stopped attending
years ago.

456
00:16:26,161 --> 00:16:28,195
No, no, hold on.
Rachel's right.

457
00:16:28,246 --> 00:16:29,280
How's anyone
supposed to believe

458
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:30,665
we can go
to Nationals if we

459
00:16:30,732 --> 00:16:31,749
don't even believe in ourselves?

460
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,400
Thank you.

ARTIE: I thought
slushies were bad,

but spaghetti sauce in the eye
is so much worse.

507

I have pepperoni
in my bra.

Those are your nipples.

509
00:19:21,765 --> 00:19:23,766
Mr. Shue, if you are trying
to break us down

510
00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:25,268
to rebuild us,
it's working.

511
00:19:25,352 --> 00:19:26,919
Not one single person
was inspired

512
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,388
by our hot lunch jam
to try out, Mr. Shue.

513
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:30,589
GIRL:
It's true.

514
00:19:30,641 --> 00:19:32,058
You guys sucked ass.

515
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:34,961
I'm sorry. And you are?

00:19:35,028 --> 00:19:36,229
I'm Sugar Motta.

517
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,147
And I have self-diagnosed
Asperger's,

518
00:19:38,232 --> 00:19:40,483
so I can pretty much
say whatever I want.

519
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:42,118
I'm like a diplomat's daughter.

520
00:19:42,202 --> 00:19:43,236
How can we
help you, Sugar?

00:19:43,287 --> 00:19:44,654
Here's the deal.

to be a big, big star.

00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:49,242
And when I saw you guys
singing and dancing

524
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:50,743
in the cafeteria,
I thought,

525
00:19:50,794 --> 00:19:52,745
"I am so much
better than you."

526
00:19:52,796 --> 00:19:54,380
Sorry. Asperger's.

527
00:19:54,447 --> 00:19:55,798
Well, great.

528
00:19:55,883 --> 00:19:57,583
You see, guys?

529
00:19:57,634 --> 00:19:58,951
You have inspired
an audition.

530
00:19:59,002 --> 00:20:00,419
Good job.
(gloved applause)

531
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,305
WILL: Sugar, why don't you
show us what you can do?

532
00:20:02,389 --> 00:20:05,057
You know, take your time.
Whenever you're ready.

533
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,676
Sugar Motta.

534
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,127
Why does that name
sound familiar?

535
00:20:08,178 --> 00:20:09,795
Oh, her daddy's
the rich dude

536
00:20:09,846 --> 00:20:11,480
that donated
the purple pianos.

537
00:20:11,565 --> 00:20:13,632
Get ready to taste
some sweet ear candy.

538
00:20:15,652 --> 00:20:16,986
Hit it, hottie.

539
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,905
("Big Spender" begins)

540
00:20:26,813 --> 00:20:30,750
(outrageously off-key):
* The minute you walked
in the joint *

541
00:20:30,817 --> 00:20:34,387
* I could see you were
a man of distinction *

542
00:20:34,454 --> 00:20:37,206
* A real big spender *

543
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:41,844
* Good-looking, so refined *

544
00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:45,548
* Wouldn't you like to know
what's going on in my mind? *

545
00:20:45,632 --> 00:20:48,050
Her ears should get to park
in my handicapped spot.

546
00:20:48,135 --> 00:20:50,002
* Hey, big spender *

547
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:53,973
* Spend... oh *

548
00:20:54,024 --> 00:20:56,859
* A little time *

549
00:20:56,944 --> 00:21:01,063
* With me *

550
00:21:01,148 --> 00:21:03,482
* Yeah. *

551
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:05,901
Holy sh... Sugar.

552
00:21:05,986 --> 00:21:07,653
Text me re:
our rehearsal "skedge."

553
00:21:07,704 --> 00:21:08,687
Of course.

554
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:09,855
Mr. Shue, stop speaking.

555
00:21:09,906 --> 00:21:10,873
Okay.

556
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,792
Uh, Sugar...

557
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:14,043
we'll be in touch.

558
00:21:14,127 --> 00:21:15,328
Thank you. Bye.

559
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,799
Okay, I think I speak
for everyone when I say--

560
00:21:19,883 --> 00:21:21,667
never gonna happen.

561
00:21:21,718 --> 00:21:24,036
Guys, I know she
was a little rough,

562
00:21:24,087 --> 00:21:25,704
but we have always
had the policy

563
00:21:25,756 --> 00:21:27,223
that anyone who tries out
gets in.

564
00:21:27,307 --> 00:21:28,557
You're not doing her any good

565
00:21:28,642 --> 00:21:29,976
sheltering Sugar
from the truth, okay?

566
00:21:30,043 --> 00:21:32,345
High school is where you learn
survival of the fittest.

567
00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:34,213
She's going to drag
the New Directions! down,

568
00:21:34,264 --> 00:21:35,547
and that's not fair
for those of us

569
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:36,732
who don't want
to spend our lives

570
00:21:36,817 --> 00:21:38,217
rotting in this
insignificant town.

571
00:21:38,268 --> 00:21:39,735
You said
the other day

572
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,570
that you would do anything
to get us to Nationals.

573
00:21:41,655 --> 00:21:42,989
Okay, and she
is going to keep us

574
00:21:43,056 --> 00:21:44,440
from winning that elusive crown.

575
00:21:44,524 --> 00:21:46,075
If anything, she's going to kill
all of our chances.

576
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,943
(bell ringing)

577
00:21:48,028 --> 00:21:49,996
<i>WILL:
I just can't look a kid
in the eye and say,</i>

578
00:21:50,063 --> 00:21:51,864
"You're not good enough
to be in Glee Club."

579
00:21:51,915 --> 00:21:53,949
Was she that bad?

580
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:57,586
Sugar Motta was just... awful.

581
00:21:57,671 --> 00:21:59,338
I mean, I have
never seen someone

582
00:21:59,406 --> 00:22:00,956
with so little musical talent.

583
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,175
But that shouldn't have
anything to do with being

584
00:22:03,243 --> 00:22:04,743
a part of a club.

585
00:22:04,795 --> 00:22:06,962
So make her water boy or
mascot or something.

586
00:22:07,047 --> 00:22:08,764
That's what I do with
my hardest luck cases.

587
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:11,000
You know how many guys
I cut last week? 60.

588
00:22:11,068 --> 00:22:12,501
And all of them
with big dreams.

589
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:13,636
And I crushed 'em

590
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,272
like pigs in a blanket.
(squealing)

591
00:22:16,356 --> 00:22:19,859
How? I mean, doesn't that
just eat you up?

592
00:22:19,926 --> 00:22:21,143
Of course.

593
00:22:21,228 --> 00:22:23,312
But it's my job to put
the guys I take

594
00:22:23,397 --> 00:22:24,947
in the best position to win.

595
00:22:25,032 --> 00:22:26,148
It's the same as you.

596
00:22:26,233 --> 00:22:28,267
The arts are different
than football.

597
00:22:28,318 --> 00:22:30,236
You win Nationals this year,

598
00:22:30,287 --> 00:22:33,572
you're buying that Glee Club
ten more years.

599
00:22:33,623 --> 00:22:35,157
EMMA:
Curve ball--

600
00:22:35,242 --> 00:22:37,076
so you just passed
"undecided"

601
00:22:37,127 --> 00:22:38,961
and "anyone white"
in the polls.

602
00:22:39,046 --> 00:22:41,580
It looks like our anti-arts
platform is actually working.

603
00:22:41,631 --> 00:22:42,998
Maybe I should rough
her up a little bit.

604
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:44,950
<i>Go all Deliverance on
her or something, huh?</i>

605
00:22:45,052 --> 00:22:46,452
WILL:
No.

606
00:22:46,503 --> 00:22:48,454
This is my fight.

607
00:22:48,505 --> 00:22:50,589
It's my program
she wants to cut,

608
00:22:50,674 --> 00:22:52,058
and my kids.

609
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:54,176
What are you going to do?

610
00:22:54,261 --> 00:22:56,829
Something I should have
done a long time ago.

611
00:22:58,298 --> 00:23:00,099
Sue wants to declare war
on the arts?

612
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:04,070
Well, General Schuester is about
to launch a counteroffensive.

613
00:23:06,473 --> 00:23:09,575
So this is what being
turned on feels like.

614
00:23:09,642 --> 00:23:11,360
(bell rings)

615
00:23:11,445 --> 00:23:14,330
It all seems so hopelessly
provincial now.

616
00:23:14,414 --> 00:23:16,165
I mean, once you've
performed on the stage

617
00:23:16,249 --> 00:23:18,650
of the Gershwin Theatre and felt
the lights of Broadway

618
00:23:18,702 --> 00:23:21,253
on your face for
the first time...

619
00:23:21,321 --> 00:23:22,821
Nothing else compares.

620
00:23:22,873 --> 00:23:25,624
What's the purple piano
doing here?

621
00:23:25,675 --> 00:23:28,043
Well, I commandeered it

622
00:23:28,128 --> 00:23:30,662
to help us get ready
for our NYADA mixer.

623
00:23:30,714 --> 00:23:32,431
Whatever rejects show up
at that place,

624
00:23:32,499 --> 00:23:34,383
are gonna be
expecting

625
00:23:34,468 --> 00:23:35,551
Pepperidge Farm cookies
and punch,

626
00:23:35,635 --> 00:23:37,853
not Velma and Roxie.

627
00:23:37,938 --> 00:23:39,438
We need to intimidate
those wannabes

628
00:23:39,506 --> 00:23:41,307
into never wanting to audition
against us.
Genius!

629
00:23:42,692 --> 00:23:44,676
<i>Wicked again?
No.</i>

630
00:23:44,728 --> 00:23:46,862
<i>Before there was Wicked,
there was...</i>

631
00:23:46,947 --> 00:23:48,013
(gasps) Don't even
finish that sentence.

632
00:23:48,115 --> 00:23:49,615
Hit it!

633
00:23:49,682 --> 00:23:54,620
(jazz version of "Ding Dong!
the Witch is Dead" begins)

634
00:23:54,687 --> 00:23:59,291
* Once there was a wicked witch
in the lovely land of Oz *

635
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:01,860
* And a wickeder, wickeder,
wickeder witch *

636
00:24:01,912 --> 00:24:04,363
* There never, ever was *

637
00:24:04,414 --> 00:24:06,865
* She filled the folks in
Munchkinland *

638
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:09,701
* With terror and with dread *

639
00:24:09,753 --> 00:24:11,554
* Till one fine day
from Kansas *

640
00:24:11,638 --> 00:24:14,706
* A house fell on her head *

641
00:24:14,758 --> 00:24:18,227
* And the coroner
pronounced her... *

642
00:24:21,064 --> 00:24:22,064
* Dead *

643
00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:23,432
* And through the town *

644
00:24:23,517 --> 00:24:26,936
* The joyous news went runnin' *

645
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,554
* The joyous news *

646
00:24:28,605 --> 00:24:31,607
* That the wicked old witch was
finally done in *

647
00:24:37,564 --> 00:24:39,915
* Ding-dong,
the Witch is dead *

648
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,116
* Which old Witch? *

649
00:24:41,201 --> 00:24:42,084
* Well, uh,
the Wicked Witch! *

650
00:24:42,169 --> 00:24:43,452
* Oh *

651
00:24:43,537 --> 00:24:45,421
* Ding-dong,
the Wicked Witch is dead *

652
00:24:45,505 --> 00:24:47,540
* Oh, yeah, happy day *

653
00:24:47,591 --> 00:24:49,575
* Wake up,
you sleepy head *

654
00:24:49,626 --> 00:24:51,243
* Rub your eyes *

655
00:24:51,294 --> 00:24:52,678
* And get out of that bed *

656
00:24:52,745 --> 00:24:57,383
* Wake up, the Wicked
Witch is dead *

657
00:24:57,434 --> 00:25:00,302
* She's gone
where the goblins go *

658
00:25:00,387 --> 00:25:02,721
* Below, below, below *

659
00:25:02,772 --> 00:25:06,525
* Yo-ho,
let's open up and sing *

660
00:25:06,593 --> 00:25:07,776
* And ring those bells out *

661
00:25:07,861 --> 00:25:10,729
* Sing the news out *

662
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,814
(Rachel laughs)

663
00:25:11,898 --> 00:25:14,033
* Ding-dong, the merry-oh *

664
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,452
* Sing it high, sing it low *

665
00:25:16,536 --> 00:25:21,624
* Let them know the
Wicked ol' Witch is dead! *

666
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:23,792
* Why, everyone's glad
she took such a crownin' *

667
00:25:23,877 --> 00:25:27,296
* Gettin' hit by a house is
even worse than drownin' *

668
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:33,402
* Let 'em know the wicked
ol' Witch is dead! *

669
00:25:35,305 --> 00:25:36,722
(song ends)

670
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:38,624
Those kids are never even
gonna know what hit them.

671
00:25:40,107 --> 00:25:40,117
+

672
00:25:41,244 --> 00:25:42,745
Ladies, the key to successful

673
00:25:42,829 --> 00:25:45,631
Cheerios! tryouts
is in brutal honesty.

674
00:25:45,698 --> 00:25:47,499
Actually, maybe just brutality,

675
00:25:47,567 --> 00:25:50,953
as I have no intention
of bringing anyone new in.

676
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,122
I just basically want
to see people cry.

677
00:25:53,206 --> 00:25:53,905
Hit it!

678
00:25:54,958 --> 00:25:55,541
Terrible!

679
00:25:57,393 --> 00:25:58,761
What is wrong with you?

680
00:26:01,247 --> 00:26:02,514
Next.

681
00:26:02,582 --> 00:26:06,151
Well, well, well,
Wavy Gravy, Dr. Zaius.

682
00:26:06,219 --> 00:26:08,086
To what do I owe this pleasure?

683
00:26:08,138 --> 00:26:10,005
Candidate Sylvester,

684
00:26:10,073 --> 00:26:13,942
To what do I owe this pleasure?

685
00:26:14,027 --> 00:26:16,895
Every tiny grain of this glitter
represents a kid

686
00:26:16,963 --> 00:26:18,981
whose dream won't come
true if you get elected

687
00:26:19,065 --> 00:26:20,315
and end school
arts programs.

688
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,617
John F. Kennedy once said,

689
00:26:21,701 --> 00:26:24,269
"The arts are the roots
of our culture."

690
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,072
The arts enrich our lives
and help kids achieve

691
00:26:27,123 --> 00:26:28,773
in all walks of life.

692
00:26:28,825 --> 00:26:29,875
Sue Sylvester...

693
00:26:32,462 --> 00:26:34,246
...you just got glitter-bombed.

694
00:26:34,297 --> 00:26:35,164
You get that?
Mm-hmm.

695
00:26:35,248 --> 00:26:36,148
Okay, come on.
Come on.

696
00:26:37,834 --> 00:26:40,552
Becky, I need the two of you
to escort me

697
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,122
to my hyperbaric chamber,
as I have glitter in my eyes.

698
00:26:46,176 --> 00:26:48,227
(bell rings)

699
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,931
Hey, you.

700
00:26:52,982 --> 00:26:56,268
Well, aren't you
a sight for these sore eyes.

701
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:58,103
Bad day?

702
00:26:58,154 --> 00:26:59,804
(sighing):
Bad week, more like it.

703
00:26:59,856 --> 00:27:01,473
Hey, what are you
doing here?

704
00:27:01,524 --> 00:27:03,192
Shouldn't you be
at Warbler practice?

705
00:27:03,276 --> 00:27:05,244
You know, putting
fine tuning touches

706
00:27:05,311 --> 00:27:06,945
on our new Katy Perry
showstopper?

707
00:27:06,996 --> 00:27:08,813
Okay, for someone who
loves clothes so much,

708
00:27:08,865 --> 00:27:10,365
I can't believe you
haven't noticed that

709
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,783
I'm not in my
Warbler outfit.

710
00:27:11,835 --> 00:27:14,253
Wait, wait...

711
00:27:16,122 --> 00:27:18,323
(Kurt gasps, Blaine laughs)

712
00:27:18,374 --> 00:27:20,459
Wait-wait-- you didn't
do this for me, did you?

713
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,010
Because if you
did this for me,

714
00:27:22,095 --> 00:27:23,462
I mean, it would be
very romantic for one,

715
00:27:23,513 --> 00:27:25,297
but it could lead to resentment,
which could lead to anger,

716
00:27:25,348 --> 00:27:26,849
which could lead to a horrible,
horrible, nasty breakup

717
00:27:26,933 --> 00:27:27,883
<i>like, you know,
on The Bachelorette,</i>

718
00:27:27,967 --> 00:27:29,101
when we watched that...

719
00:27:29,168 --> 00:27:30,669
Hey, I came here for me.

720
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,273
Because I can't stand to be
apart from the person I love.

721
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:38,143
Well, I guess we'll
just have to find a way

722
00:27:38,194 --> 00:27:40,028
to ease you into the
New Directions! now, huh?

723
00:27:40,113 --> 00:27:41,947
I've already have
that figured out.

724
00:27:42,014 --> 00:27:44,867
(Tom Jones'
"It's Not Unusual" begins)

725
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:58,630
* It's not unusual
to be loved by anyone *

726
00:27:58,698 --> 00:28:03,368
* It's not unusual to have
fun with anyone *

727
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:08,223
* But when I see you
hanging about with anyone *

728
00:28:08,308 --> 00:28:13,178
* It's not unusual
to see me cry *

729
00:28:13,229 --> 00:28:15,547
* I wanna die *

730
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:21,886
* It's not unusual
to go out at any time *

731
00:28:21,938 --> 00:28:27,292
* But when I see you out and
about it's such a crime *

732
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,197
* If you should ever want
to be loved by anyone *

733
00:28:32,248 --> 00:28:34,533
* It's not unusual *

734
00:28:34,584 --> 00:28:36,785
* It happens every day *

735
00:28:36,869 --> 00:28:40,088
* No matter what you say *

736
00:28:40,173 --> 00:28:44,909
* You find it happens
all the time *

737
00:28:44,961 --> 00:28:47,346
* Love will never do *

738
00:28:47,413 --> 00:28:50,215
* What you want it to *

739
00:28:50,266 --> 00:28:57,806
* Why can't this
crazy love be mine? *

740
00:29:08,201 --> 00:29:12,321
* It's not unusual
to be mad with anyone *

741
00:29:13,906 --> 00:29:19,578
* It's not unusual
to be sad with anyone *

742
00:29:19,629 --> 00:29:24,049
* But if I ever find that you've
changed at any time *

743
00:29:24,116 --> 00:29:29,120
* It's not unusual to find out
I'm in love with you *

744
00:29:29,172 --> 00:29:31,556
* Whoa-whoa-whoa,
oh-oh-oh *

745
00:29:31,624 --> 00:29:33,558
* Whoa-whoa, whoa-oh *

746
00:29:33,626 --> 00:29:38,063
* Whoa-whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh *

747
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,765
* Whoa-whoa. *

748
00:29:42,101 --> 00:29:43,185
(song ends)

749
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:44,236
(applause)

750
00:29:52,228 --> 00:29:52,238
+

751
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,667
Okay, so you're gonna
set up the props,

752
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:55,952
I'll plug in the boombox,

753
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:57,253
and we'll launch
immediately into the number.

754
00:29:57,304 --> 00:29:58,555
Our somewhat-talented

755
00:29:58,622 --> 00:30:00,390
but sadly delusional
competition will just rip up

756
00:30:00,474 --> 00:30:02,291
their applications in
fits of jealous rage.

757
00:30:02,343 --> 00:30:03,676
And then they'll all
just melt away

758
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:05,228
like the Wicked Witch
of the West herself!

759
00:30:05,295 --> 00:30:06,513
You know what?

760
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:10,266
I kinda feel sorry
for them.
Me, too.

761
00:30:10,317 --> 00:30:11,684
(giggles)

762
00:30:20,811 --> 00:30:22,278
Hi, I'm Harmony.

763
00:30:22,329 --> 00:30:23,113
What's your name,
where are you from,

764
00:30:23,164 --> 00:30:24,664
and what are your credits?

765
00:30:24,749 --> 00:30:27,150
Well, I'm, I'm Rachel.
I'm Pendelton!
I'm Canada!

766
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:28,501
I'm Gavroche, named after

767
00:30:28,586 --> 00:30:30,820
<i>ze feisty French street urchin
from Les Mis!</i>

768
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,922
I know you totally recognize me.

769
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,374
It's 'cause I'm
the Gerber baby.

770
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,459
I've been acting since I was
a fetus... literally.

771
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,628
<i>An ultrasound of me was
featured on Murder She Wrote.</i>

772
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:40,296
I'm starring as Rizzo in
an all-male production

773
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:42,098
<i>of Grease.
Welcome, welcome, welcome!</i>

774
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:45,301
As my future husband Robert
Pattinson always says,

775
00:30:45,352 --> 00:30:47,003
"It's refreshing
to get new blood."

776
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:48,271
Oh! New blood?

777
00:30:48,338 --> 00:30:49,606
We've been meeting here
each month

778
00:30:49,673 --> 00:30:51,641
since we were freshmen,
literally.

779
00:30:51,692 --> 00:30:55,178
Well, actually Kurt and I just
found out about this on Monday.

780
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:57,013
But speaking of "refreshing,"
we've put together a number

781
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:58,064
that we think
you guys...
Places!

782
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,950
You're just in time
to see a little number

783
00:31:01,035 --> 00:31:02,318
we've been futzing
around with.

784
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:04,788
Thank God there was a bar
mitzvah here on Saturday.

785
00:31:04,855 --> 00:31:07,073
And I convinced them
not to strike the stage.

786
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:11,795
So sit back, relax,
and most importantly, enjoy.

787
00:31:11,862 --> 00:31:12,695
Thank you.

788
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:13,797
Oh, my God...

789
00:31:13,864 --> 00:31:15,465
Just, just breathe
and smile, okay?

790
00:31:15,532 --> 00:31:17,717
Just 'cause they look
like us and act like us

791
00:31:17,802 --> 00:31:19,169
doesn't mean
they're better than us.

792
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,837
("Anything Goes" begins)

793
00:31:20,888 --> 00:31:22,972

the clock *

00:31:28,212 --> 00:31:30,730

a shock *

798
00:31:38,555 --> 00:31:41,557

* Was looked on
as something shocking *

804

* But now God knows *

805

* Anything goes! *

806
00:32:04,515 --> 00:32:06,582
* Good authors, too,
who once knew better words *

807
00:32:06,684 --> 00:32:11,521

I've never, I've never been
so humiliated in my life.

831
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:30,550
Me, either.

832
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,685
And that's a really high bar.

833
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:35,939
I mean, they were so...

834
00:33:36,006 --> 00:33:37,557
Fabulous.

836
00:33:39,276 --> 00:33:41,444
Rachel, we might be
hot stuff at McKinley,

837
00:33:41,511 --> 00:33:44,981
but outside those walls,
we aren't even stuff.

838
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:48,034
I mean, we've been
deluded and arrogant.

839
00:33:48,118 --> 00:33:49,352
(sobs)

840
00:33:49,403 --> 00:33:52,155
What if we're not
good enough to make it?

841
00:33:52,206 --> 00:33:54,023
No.

842
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:55,742
There's only
one thing to do.

843
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:58,027
(blows nose)
We just have to move
to another town

844
00:33:58,078 --> 00:33:59,879
and just erase
our identities

845
00:33:59,964 --> 00:34:01,547
and just resign to a sad life
of community theater.

846
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,132
Don't say that.

847
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,002
<i>Nun-Sense, Love Letters,
The Vagina Monologues.</i>

848
00:34:06,053 --> 00:34:07,971
Face it, I mean,
this is our future.

849
00:34:08,038 --> 00:34:11,057
Not everyone's
dreams come true.

(sniffles)

852
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,878
I'm ending this
pity party right now.

853
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:17,430
Okay.

854
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,315
Take a look at yourself.

855
00:34:19,383 --> 00:34:20,600
What do you see?

856
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:23,069
Come on.

857
00:34:23,153 --> 00:34:25,104
Sad, puffy, red eyes

860
00:34:30,327 --> 00:34:32,028
One of a kind.

861
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,396
(thunder rumbling)
There's no one like you.

862
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:35,114
Well, that's actually
kind of funny,

863
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,866
because it seems
like there is.

864
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:39,285
Okay, fine, so you've never been
in a high school production.

865
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,621
<i>Or any production, because,
you know, Cabaret was canceled</i>

866
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:43,039
<i>and so was Rocky Horror.</i>

867
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:44,907
Mm-mm. They had
credits, Kurt.

868
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,092
In utero credits.

869
00:34:46,176 --> 00:34:48,961
Okay, so they have
more experience.

870
00:34:49,046 --> 00:34:50,746
They have more talent.

871
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:53,416
But you are fierce, Rachel.

872
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:57,520
Your ambition does push-ups
while you sleep.

873
00:34:57,587 --> 00:34:59,972
Nobody wants it
more than you.

874
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:01,924
Nobody.

875
00:35:04,428 --> 00:35:07,113
And you're not
giving up on this.

876
00:35:07,197 --> 00:35:09,482
'Cause I'm not gonna let you.

877
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,367
You are getting
into that school.

878
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:17,106
(sniffles)

879
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:18,774
You make me want to
be your boyfriend.

880
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:20,793
(chuckles)

881
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:22,495
You're getting in, too.

882
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:23,496
I know it.

883
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,782
I doubt it.

884
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:29,335
I'm woefully thin
on extracurriculars.

885
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,304
It's not too late.

886
00:35:31,388 --> 00:35:33,556
I mean, you could, you know,
still sign up for some clubs.

887
00:35:33,623 --> 00:35:36,426
There's the student council.

888
00:35:36,477 --> 00:35:39,345
I'm not the only fierce one.

889
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,981
(sniffles)

890
00:35:42,066 --> 00:35:44,484
Swear it.

891
00:35:44,568 --> 00:35:45,685
We're gonna do this.

892
00:35:57,831 --> 00:35:58,998
(both laugh)

893
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:02,085
(sniffles, sighs)

894
00:36:02,152 --> 00:36:03,986
You realize we just did
the gay high-five.

895
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:04,837
(laughs):
Yeah, we did.

896
00:36:06,009 --> 00:36:06,019
+

897
00:36:06,705 --> 00:36:08,072
(alarm beeping)

898
00:36:11,493 --> 00:36:14,728
Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

899
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,163
Come on.

900
00:36:19,668 --> 00:36:21,368
I don't want to go
to school today.

901
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,003
I know.

902
00:36:23,071 --> 00:36:26,073
It's the right thing to do for
the club, the greater good.

903
00:36:26,124 --> 00:36:28,075
I just can't kill
a kid's dream.

904
00:36:28,126 --> 00:36:29,927
I can't do it.

905
00:36:30,011 --> 00:36:32,963
Will, you glitter-bombed Sue.

906
00:36:33,048 --> 00:36:36,851
This week, you stopped
being a man of words,

907
00:36:36,918 --> 00:36:39,136
and you became
a man of action.

908
00:36:39,221 --> 00:36:42,089
And it was super-hot.

909
00:36:46,862 --> 00:36:48,112
(bell ringing)

910
00:36:48,196 --> 00:36:49,613
Obviously your ears
are busted because

911
00:36:49,698 --> 00:36:51,031
I worked that song
like a hooker pole.

912
00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:52,266
It's no biggie.

913
00:36:52,317 --> 00:36:53,534
I'll come in and
I'll do it again.

914
00:36:53,601 --> 00:36:56,403
Sugar, I'm sorry...
you can't sing.

915
00:36:56,455 --> 00:36:57,955
The answer is no.

916
00:36:58,039 --> 00:36:59,290
But I love your enthusiasm,

917
00:36:59,374 --> 00:37:01,826
and I'd be so happy
to work with you so that...

918
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,544
You know what?
Who cares what you think?

919
00:37:03,611 --> 00:37:05,663
Hmm? Nobody.

920
00:37:05,747 --> 00:37:07,281
You're a washed-up
Broadway wannabe

921
00:37:07,332 --> 00:37:08,782
who's stuck in Lima

922
00:37:08,834 --> 00:37:10,751
and has led the Glee Club
to how many National wins?

923
00:37:10,802 --> 00:37:12,520
Oh, I'm sorry, zero.

924
00:37:12,587 --> 00:37:15,422
Not Asperger's!

925
00:37:15,474 --> 00:37:18,642
SUE:
Nicely played, William.

926
00:37:18,727 --> 00:37:19,844
(chuckles)

927
00:37:19,928 --> 00:37:22,229
You know, I have to say,
I'm really enjoying

928
00:37:22,297 --> 00:37:24,932
this new stink of man marbles
wafting off of you this year.

929
00:37:24,983 --> 00:37:27,301
I did not enjoy
doing that, Sue.

930
00:37:27,352 --> 00:37:28,769
Oh, I'm not talking
about that.

931
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,821
I'm talking about your little
pixie dust hate crime.

932
00:37:30,906 --> 00:37:33,274
You know, it took Becky
three hours to pick the glitter

933
00:37:33,325 --> 00:37:34,909
from my scalp
like a little chimp.

934
00:37:34,976 --> 00:37:36,026
Good.

935
00:37:36,111 --> 00:37:37,144
I hope it taught
you a lesson.

936
00:37:37,195 --> 00:37:38,329
It did, Will.

937
00:37:38,413 --> 00:37:40,998
It taught me that
everyone loves a martyr.

938
00:37:41,082 --> 00:37:43,751
The day after your little video
went up on YouTube,

939
00:37:43,818 --> 00:37:46,170
I went up seven points
in the polls.

940
00:37:46,254 --> 00:37:49,957
Turns out, your hate is a lot
like high-octane Sue-fluid.

941
00:37:50,008 --> 00:37:51,258
(snaps fingers)

942
00:37:51,326 --> 00:37:53,660
(bell ringing)

943
00:37:53,712 --> 00:37:56,764
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it for

944
00:37:56,831 --> 00:37:57,848
Glee Club's newest member,

945
00:37:57,933 --> 00:37:59,016
Blaine Anderson.

946
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,100
Thanks so much,
everyone.

947
00:38:00,168 --> 00:38:01,385
I'm so thrilled
to be here.

948
00:38:01,469 --> 00:38:03,170
It's gonna be a great year,
I can feel it.

949
00:38:03,221 --> 00:38:04,838
We're all gonna go
to Nationals.

950
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:06,473
(cheering)
Yeah.

951
00:38:08,944 --> 00:38:11,028
Is there a problem, guys?

952
00:38:11,146 --> 00:38:14,514
I just want Blaine to know
that we're not the Warblers.

953
00:38:14,566 --> 00:38:17,451
You know, we're not into
the bells and whistles

954
00:38:17,518 --> 00:38:19,320
or the ball hogging, you know?

955
00:38:19,371 --> 00:38:21,121
I'm sorry, did I do
something wrong?

956
00:38:21,189 --> 00:38:23,657
Well, yeah, you set a bonfire
in our courtyard.

957
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:26,460
Actually, Doorknob, that was
an act of political protest.

958
00:38:26,527 --> 00:38:29,163
Which leads me
to the next order of business.

959
00:38:29,214 --> 00:38:31,549
Santana, you need to leave.

960
00:38:31,633 --> 00:38:34,385
It was you and the Cheerios!
who set fire to our piano.

961
00:38:34,469 --> 00:38:35,302
How could you do that?

962
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:37,004
Mr. Shue, Sue made me.

963
00:38:37,055 --> 00:38:38,088
Brittany didn't do it.

964
00:38:38,173 --> 00:38:39,473
Well, yeah, I was gonna help,

965
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,508
but I don't know,
I'm a water sign, so...

966
00:38:42,677 --> 00:38:44,261
You're banned from Glee.

967
00:38:44,346 --> 00:38:46,897
Don't come back unless you can
be as loyal to this club

968
00:38:46,982 --> 00:38:48,766
as the rest of the people
in this room.

969
00:38:53,855 --> 00:38:55,072
You know what?

970
00:38:55,156 --> 00:38:56,223
I could use a break.

971
00:39:02,864 --> 00:39:04,231
You know, good for you,
Mr. Shue.

972
00:39:04,282 --> 00:39:07,284
It's about time we got
some allegiance up in here.

973
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:09,336
I said it before
and I will say it again--

974
00:39:09,404 --> 00:39:12,206
we want to win Nationals
this year, we need to be united.

975
00:39:12,257 --> 00:39:13,540
Rachel, you had an announcement?

976
00:39:13,592 --> 00:39:15,793
Yeah.

977
00:39:15,877 --> 00:39:17,962
Um, after pushing the envelope
last year, I strongly believe

978
00:39:18,046 --> 00:39:19,380
that we should
secure the rights to

979
00:39:19,431 --> 00:39:20,931
a, shall we say,

980
00:39:21,016 --> 00:39:23,384
less controversial show
for our school musical.

981
00:39:23,435 --> 00:39:25,302
Wait for it.

982
00:39:25,387 --> 00:39:26,437
<i>West Side Story.</i>

983
00:39:26,521 --> 00:39:28,305
Is that the one with the cats?

984
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:29,640
And it just so
happens to have

985
00:39:29,724 --> 00:39:30,941
a lead role that showcases

986
00:39:31,026 --> 00:39:33,160
my talent and essence perfectly:
Maria.

987
00:39:33,228 --> 00:39:34,094
MERCEDES:
For which there will be

988
00:39:34,145 --> 00:39:35,696
open auditions, right?

989
00:39:35,763 --> 00:39:38,532
Because Mercedes is feeling
extremely pretty this year.

990
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:41,201
Kurt, you had
something, too, right?

991
00:39:41,269 --> 00:39:43,070
Kurt Hummel
is wading into

992
00:39:43,121 --> 00:39:45,605
McKinley High's shark-
infested political waters

993
00:39:45,657 --> 00:39:46,957
and ruing for senior
class president.

994
00:39:47,042 --> 00:39:49,209
All right, I thank you in
advance for your votes.

995
00:39:49,277 --> 00:39:50,327
Okay.

996
00:39:50,412 --> 00:39:52,997
So much excitement.
Now let's rehearse.

997
00:39:53,081 --> 00:39:56,016
Look at what they
did to us, Mr. Shue.

998
00:39:56,084 --> 00:39:58,602
Just like these purple pianos,
they ripped out our guts,

999
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:01,221
threw crap all over
us and burned us up.

1000
00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:04,808
Yeah.
We got hit pretty hard.

1001
00:40:04,893 --> 00:40:06,760
But...

1002
00:40:06,811 --> 00:40:09,513
(plays three notes)

1003
00:40:09,597 --> 00:40:11,131
...these pianos
are still making music.

1004
00:40:11,182 --> 00:40:13,300
And so are we.

1005
00:40:13,351 --> 00:40:17,905
Mr. Shue, as always, you and I
are on the exact same page.

1006
00:40:22,243 --> 00:40:24,194
(piano playing
"You Can't Stop the Beat")

1007
00:40:24,279 --> 00:40:28,248
* You can't stop an avalanche *

1008
00:40:28,316 --> 00:40:33,420
* As it races down the hill *

1009
00:40:33,488 --> 00:40:37,174
* You can try
to stop the seasons *

1010
00:40:37,258 --> 00:40:42,846
* But you know you never will *

1011
00:40:42,931 --> 00:40:48,052
* And you can try
to stop my dancing feet *

1012
00:40:48,136 --> 00:40:52,022
* But I just cannot
stand still *

1013
00:40:52,107 --> 00:40:57,194
* 'Cause the world keeps
spinning round and round *

1014
00:40:57,278 --> 00:41:02,783
* And my heart's keeping time
to the speed of sound *

1015
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:04,902
* I was lost
till I heard the drums *

1016
00:41:04,986 --> 00:41:09,206
* Then I found my way *

1017
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:14,294
* 'Cause you can't
stop the beat *

1018
00:41:14,362 --> 00:41:16,029
Five, six, seven, eight!

1019
00:41:16,081 --> 00:41:18,532
* Ever since
this old world began *

1020
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:21,802
* A woman found out if she shook
it, she could shake up a man *

1021
00:41:21,869 --> 00:41:23,170
* And so I'm gonna
shake and shimmy it *

1022
00:41:23,221 --> 00:41:25,973
* The best that I can today *

1023
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,541
* 'Cause you can't stop *

1024
00:41:27,592 --> 00:41:29,643
* The motion of the ocean
or the sun in the sky *

1025
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:32,646
* You can wonder if you wanna,
but I never ask why *

1026
00:41:32,713 --> 00:41:34,381
* If you try to hold me down *

1027
00:41:34,432 --> 00:41:37,067
* I'm gonna spit
in your eye and say *

1028
00:41:37,152 --> 00:41:39,386
* That you can't stop the beat *

1029
00:41:46,945 --> 00:41:48,779
<i>* You can't stop today *
* No *</i>

1030
00:41:48,863 --> 00:41:51,615
* As it comes
speeding down the track *

1031
00:41:51,699 --> 00:41:53,200
<i>* Ooh, child, yeah *</i>

1032
00:41:53,251 --> 00:41:55,252
<i>* Child, yesterday is history *
* Be gone *</i>

1033
00:41:55,336 --> 00:41:58,288
* And it's never coming back *

1034
00:41:58,373 --> 00:42:01,341
* 'Cause tomorrow is
a brand-new day *

1035
00:42:01,409 --> 00:42:03,743
<i>* And it don't know
white from black *
* Yeah *</i>

00:42:21,146 --> 00:42:23,564
* Ever since we first
saw the sun *

1043
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:26,533
* A man and woman like to shake
it when the day is done *

1044
00:42:26,601 --> 00:42:27,985
* So I'm gonna
shake and shimmy it *

1045
00:42:28,069 --> 00:42:30,770
* And have some fun today *

1046
00:42:30,822 --> 00:42:32,289
* 'Cause you can't stop *

1047
00:42:32,373 --> 00:42:34,491
* The motion of the ocean
or the rain from above *

1048
00:42:34,576 --> 00:42:37,161
* You can try to stop
the paradise we're dreaming of *

1049
00:42:37,245 --> 00:42:41,965
* But you cannot stop the rhythm
of two hearts in love to stay *

1050
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:43,383
* You can't stop the beat *

1051
00:42:43,451 --> 00:42:45,085
<i>* You can't
stop the beat *</i>

1052
00:42:45,136 --> 00:42:46,553
* You can't stop the beat *

1053
00:42:46,621 --> 00:42:47,805
<i>* You can't
stop the beat *</i>

1054
00:42:47,889 --> 00:42:50,757
* You can't stop the beat *

1055
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:54,628
* Yeah, yeah! *

1056
