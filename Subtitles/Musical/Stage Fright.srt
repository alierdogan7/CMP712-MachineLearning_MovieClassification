00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:54,632
What career? He hasn't
produced anything in 10 years.

172
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,768
Well, if doing the play
again can help him

173
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,270
get back to New York,
that's a good thing.

174
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:02,106
- For all of us.
- You always seem to forget:

175
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:03,808
he's not our father.

176
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,413
Maybe I could even audition.

177
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:11,149
You actually wanna compete
with those theatre geeks?

178
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:14,219
Those kids aren't normal, Cam.
Look at them.

179
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:17,422
The entire musical theatre
canon is just begging -

180
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:22,393
begging! - for its themes
to be exploded outwards.

181
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,729
Watch, I bet he casts
himself as Alfonso.

182
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:28,433
Uh, for those of you wondering,
yes, I will be playing Alfonso.

183
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:31,736
- Yep.
- It's probably 'cause he
wants you to play Opera Ghost.

184
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:34,739
- Or 'cause he wants
to make out with me again.
- ...which is the very essence

185
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:38,376
of post-structuralism
in theatre today, and that's why

186
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,745
our production of<i> Haunting...</i>

187
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:43,414

00:43:29,674 --> 00:43:32,375
What?

516
00:43:32,377 --> 00:43:34,277
Maybe this show is cursed.

517
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:36,980
McCall tries to produce this
10 years ago

518
00:43:36,982 --> 00:43:39,382
and his starlet is killed
on opening night.

519
00:43:39,384 --> 00:43:42,151
He tries again,
and the director gets killed.

520
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:44,187
Maybe there's somebody out there

521
00:43:44,189 --> 00:43:47,857
that really doesn't want him
to put on this play.

522
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:51,194
(ROGER) Like I said before,

523
00:43:51,196 --> 00:43:54,631
the sheriff is on his way.

524
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:59,869
I can make you this promise:
that whatever

525
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:03,706
that accident was,
it will not occur again.

526
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:05,274
Hey.

527
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:12,815
You OK?

528
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:17,053
I told you not to get
involved with their crowd

529
00:44:17,055 --> 00:44:20,023
- in the first place.
- What does that have to do with anything?

530
00:44:20,025 --> 00:44:23,192
Nothing! I'm just saying, this summer, ever
since you decided to be in their show...

531
00:44:23,194 --> 00:44:25,228
I just thought I should try it.

532
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:31,934
I think about Mom a lot,

533
00:44:31,936 --> 00:44:33,936
and when I got my chance

534
00:44:33,938 --> 00:44:36,372
and I was up there,
singing her songs,

535
00:44:36,374 --> 00:44:40,176
for the first time in my life
I thought,

536
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,679
"Maybe this is what I'm
supposed to do".

537
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:48,751
I don't expect you to know
what I'm talking about.

538
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:54,757
I do.

539
00:44:54,759 --> 00:44:56,759
I saw you rehearse.

540
00:44:56,761 --> 00:45:00,263
You were good.

541
00:45:00,265 --> 00:45:02,265
You think so?

542
00:45:02,267 --> 00:45:04,000
Yeah.

543
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:06,069
Really good.

544
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:12,975
Right now I just want to leave.

545
00:45:12,977 --> 00:45:15,978
This camp, the play, everything.

546
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:22,185
So let's go.

547
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:30,126
(CROWD TALKING EXCITEDLY)

548
00:45:30,128 --> 00:45:33,896
No. No, no, no.
David, control them.

549
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:36,966
I gotta call the sheriff.
I gotta call the sheriff!

550
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,949
Fuck. Fuck!

551
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:55,518
(PHONE RINGING)
Ah! Oh.

552
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:02,558
- Center Stage.
- Roger McCall, please.

553
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,894
Who am I speaking with?

554
00:46:04,896 --> 00:46:06,395
Victor Brady,

555
00:46:06,397 --> 00:46:09,031
42nd Street Productions.
Who am I speaking with?

556
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:14,537
Oh, Mr. Brady. This is Roger
McCall. Thank you so much.

557
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:16,539
I don't know if you remember me
or not...

558
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:18,040
Yes, I do recall.

559
00:46:18,042 --> 00:46:20,243
So, tell me about this showcase
you have planned.

560
00:46:20,245 --> 00:46:22,879
We're reviving<i> Haunting.</i>

561
00:46:22,881 --> 00:46:26,015
It is set in feudal Japan,
it is kabuki...

562
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:27,550
Did you say kabuki?

563
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:31,687
Uh...

564
00:46:31,689 --> 00:46:33,656
(CHUCKLING)

565
00:46:33,658 --> 00:46:35,391
Oh, that's a riot.

566
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:38,795
(CHUCKLING)
Yes, sir, what a riot!

567
00:46:38,797 --> 00:46:41,998
But, sir, you'll be blown away
by this cast.

568
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,466
I need to talk to you.

569
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:46,169
Is that so?
Who's your Sofia?

570
00:46:46,171 --> 00:46:49,505
I mean, I hate to stoke
the fires, but...

571
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:53,543
I always felt that if Kylie Swanson
hadn't been killed that night,

572
00:46:53,545 --> 00:46:56,012
the show would've run
a lot longer than it did.

573
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:00,716
Of course.

574
00:47:00,718 --> 00:47:02,718
I agree.

575
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,722
But we have the perfect
successor: her daughter,

576
00:47:06,724 --> 00:47:08,357
Camilla.

577
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:11,227
Tonight at eight?

578
00:47:11,229 --> 00:47:13,229
My assistant has the address?

579
00:47:13,231 --> 00:47:15,898
- Yes, sir. Of course, sir.
- See you then.

580
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,772
Camilla, I think you need

581
00:47:22,774 --> 00:47:25,641
to get some rest before
your big performance tonight.

582
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:31,214
Buddy and I are moving out.

583
00:47:31,216 --> 00:47:34,217
Do you know who was on that phone?

584
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:36,085
That was Victor Brady,

585
00:47:36,087 --> 00:47:39,722
42nd Street Productions,
and he's coming tonight

586
00:47:39,724 --> 00:47:41,524
to see you.

587
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:44,861
Well, he's just gonna have
to see Liz instead.

588
00:47:44,863 --> 00:47:47,930
I know you're still shaken
about the accident...

589
00:47:47,932 --> 00:47:50,299
No, it's not that. I just...

590
00:47:50,301 --> 00:47:53,603
I've just realized that
this whole thing is not for me.

591
00:47:55,539 --> 00:48:00,176
Camilla, what about everything
you've worked so hard on?

592
00:48:00,178 --> 00:48:01,777
What about Artie?

593
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,948
What about him?

594
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:11,454
He wanted you to play Sofia.

595
00:48:11,456 --> 00:48:14,423
He always did.
He told me so.

596
00:48:14,425 --> 00:48:16,125
No, he didn't.

597
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,627
He did.

598
00:48:17,629 --> 00:48:20,029
He told me...

599
00:48:20,031 --> 00:48:23,032
he'd seen you transform
on that stage

600
00:48:23,034 --> 00:48:27,270
as if you were meant to be Sofia.

601
00:48:27,272 --> 00:48:30,773
But, of course... you get it

602
00:48:30,775 --> 00:48:32,541
from your mother.

603
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:37,647
Take tonight.

604
00:48:37,649 --> 00:48:40,149
Give Sofia one last chance.

605
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:42,885
I'm calling my mom back!

606
00:48:42,887 --> 00:48:45,521
No, no, please.
No, no, no, no.

607
00:48:45,523 --> 00:48:47,657
If I don't call my dad,
he is going to kill me!

608
00:48:47,659 --> 00:48:50,860
- Get them down and get them to shut up.
- Quiet!

609
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:55,998
Quiet!

610
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,967
Thank you.

611
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,105
So, is Limelight cancelled?

612
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:11,380
You have a decision to make:

613
00:49:11,382 --> 00:49:14,016
if you go in

614
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:16,018
and use that phone,

615
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,020
the show's over,

616
00:49:18,022 --> 00:49:19,722
camp's over,

617
00:49:19,724 --> 00:49:21,991
and you go home -

618
00:49:21,993 --> 00:49:23,993
to your parents.

619
00:49:23,995 --> 00:49:26,629
(KIDS MURMURING)
Unless!

620
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:32,234
Unless we wait.

621
00:49:32,236 --> 00:49:34,737
One day.

622
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:36,305
Just one more day.

623
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:42,411
And we do the show,
as planned, tonight.

624
00:49:42,413 --> 00:49:44,680
But...

625
00:49:44,682 --> 00:49:47,249
isn't it wrong to sing and dance

626
00:49:47,251 --> 00:49:50,386
- when someone just died?
- (KIDS) Yeah.

627
00:49:50,388 --> 00:49:55,157
- (KID) Isn't that illegal?
- (KID) What about the sheriff?

628
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:04,066
Do you remember the first time

629
00:50:04,068 --> 00:50:06,502
you ever saw a musical play?

630
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:12,408
Do you remember the first time
that you ever got swept away?

631
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:16,746
No matter what bad stuff
happened that day,

632
00:50:16,748 --> 00:50:20,683
when that show was over,
you probably felt OK.

633
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:22,618
That's why

634
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:26,956
theatre has been around so long.

635
00:50:26,958 --> 00:50:31,560
That's why we need musical songs.
