1
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:33,296
This dance is dancing.

2
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:47,652
It's nothing if it's
not for dance.

3
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:56,424
What is its relation with breath?

4
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:09,602
In fact, this is breath.

5
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:34,131
It's in the drifting heart.

6
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:36,462
Indeed, it's dance!

7
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:39,132
It's in the whole life.

8
00:02:39,206 --> 00:02:41,140
It's in the rhythm of the tunes.

9
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,142
Indeed, it's dance!

10
00:02:45,212 --> 00:02:46,736
I've achieved it.

11
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:48,303
It's my shadow.

12
00:02:48,482 --> 00:02:50,313
I've achieved it.

13
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:52,146
It's my shadow.

14
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:55,484
It's in all my veins.

15
00:02:55,555 --> 00:02:57,648
It's in every particle of my body.

16
00:02:57,724 --> 00:02:59,157
Dance.

17
00:03:55,215 --> 00:03:57,479
It's in the flash
of the eye-lashes.

18
00:03:57,551 --> 00:03:59,143
It's in the thumping of the hand.

19
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:01,084
Indeed, it's dance!

20
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:04,089
It's in my passions.

21
00:04:04,157 --> 00:04:06,091
It's in the yearning
of the spirit.

22
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,093
Indeed, it's dance!

23
00:04:10,163 --> 00:04:11,255
It's compassion.

24
00:04:11,331 --> 00:04:13,492
It's the material desire.

25
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:15,091
It's compassion.

26
00:04:15,168 --> 00:04:17,261
It's the material desire.

27
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:20,101
It's a dream and it's a reality.

28
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:22,368
Verily, it's the need as well.

29
00:04:22,442 --> 00:04:24,103
Indeed, it's dance.

30
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:50,631
Dance!

31
00:08:42,702 --> 00:08:44,101
So, what can i do?

32
00:08:51,311 --> 00:08:53,108
Thank you.

33
00:08:57,283 --> 00:09:01,447
Have you directed in
any film? - Not yet so far.

34
00:09:01,588 --> 00:09:05,217
Any experience? Any training under
some established dance director?

35
00:09:06,392 --> 00:09:08,223
Sir, i don't feel that any
training is needed...

36
00:09:08,294 --> 00:09:09,556
...to become a choreographer.

37
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,222
Why is that so?

38
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:13,456
Sir, i know dance.

39
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:16,401
You can take my audition
if you want to.

40
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,530
Look, whoever comes here
is no doubt talented.

41
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:25,243
Anyway, take this song cd.

42
00:09:25,478 --> 00:09:28,345
And, you know, compose something
and show it to me. - Fine.

43
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:32,241
Look, i won't promise you,
but if i like your work...

44
00:09:32,318 --> 00:09:35,253
...then, maybe, we can move ahead.

45
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:37,355
Is that clear?
- Okay, sir.

46
00:09:37,423 --> 00:09:38,481
Thank you, sir.

47
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:39,616
Who is it?

48
00:09:42,262 --> 00:09:45,254
My world is by you.

49
00:09:45,565 --> 00:09:47,089
And, my life is by you.

50
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:50,158
And, what more should i seek?

51
00:09:50,436 --> 00:09:53,098
As, all the bliss is mine.

52
00:09:53,273 --> 00:09:57,607
I've become the colour
that you created.

53
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,104
Hi.

54
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:04,779
I think i saw you in the office
of shaan productions.

55
00:10:06,286 --> 00:10:07,446
Do you work there?

56
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:11,118
No.

57
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,185
I'm an actor. But, haven't
acted as yet.

58
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:20,732
I went for that film.

59
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:23,460
But, they wanted a dancer hero...

60
00:10:23,536 --> 00:10:26,471
...and, i don't know how to dance.

61
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,130
You?

62
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:31,301
I'm a dance director.

63
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:35,475
But, haven't directed
any dance as yet.

64
00:10:37,317 --> 00:10:38,477
Superb!

65
00:10:38,751 --> 00:10:40,150
Great!

66
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,149
Fantastic!

67
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:55,496
If there's a demand
in the industry...

68
00:10:55,568 --> 00:10:57,160
...for an actor to be a dancer...

69
00:10:57,236 --> 00:10:58,760
...then who am i to say
anything about it?

70
00:11:01,174 --> 00:11:02,573
And, i still find all
this a bit silly.

71
00:11:02,642 --> 00:11:04,109
One, two three, you know?

72
00:11:05,678 --> 00:11:08,272
Sorry. I didn't mean
to degrade dance.

73
00:11:11,451 --> 00:11:14,386
By the way, which institute
did you learn it from?

74
00:11:15,588 --> 00:11:18,284
I never learnt it from any
institute. - You mean?

75
00:11:36,609 --> 00:11:38,474
After hearing you out, it's
for the first time...

76
00:11:38,544 --> 00:11:40,671
...that an interest for dance
is developing in me.

77
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:50,145
Can you teach me?

78
00:11:53,493 --> 00:11:54,551
I don't teach.

79
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:57,554
Why?

80
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:03,432
Don't you feel that; if
you have something...

81
00:12:03,503 --> 00:12:06,267
...that is worth teaching then
you should teach it!

82
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,112
Nice meeting you.

83
00:12:20,453 --> 00:12:21,511
Abhi.

84
00:12:21,587 --> 00:12:23,111
Abhinav.

85
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:25,123
Reva.

86
00:12:29,462 --> 00:12:30,520
Who are you?

87
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:35,297
My world is by you.

88
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:38,467
And, my life is by you.

89
00:12:38,538 --> 00:12:40,563
And, what more should i seek?

90
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:43,298
As, all the bliss is mine.

91
00:12:46,312 --> 00:12:48,473
The memories have wiped out.

92
00:12:48,548 --> 00:12:50,209
And, i've recoiled as such.

93
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:55,648
Now, your way is my way.

94
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:01,084
It's in your love that i...

95
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:35,120
i think you're perfect.

96
00:13:47,473 --> 00:13:50,306
I'll do a screen test of yours
and show it to my producer.

97
00:13:53,312 --> 00:13:55,473
Hanif-samar! They have done
50 super-hit films!

98
00:13:55,548 --> 00:13:56,606
And, you...

99
00:13:56,682 --> 00:13:58,616
you want to say that you need
some changes in their music?

100
00:13:58,718 --> 00:14:00,151
Sir, i didn't mean to...

101
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:03,086
...and what do you think of yourself?

102
00:14:03,356 --> 00:14:06,553
If you want to dance, then you wll
do it on this music itself!

103
00:14:09,428 --> 00:14:11,589
Sir, then i won't be
able to do this song.

104
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:15,097
Sorry for wasting your time.

105
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:34,119
The producer saw your screen test?

106
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:38,122
And?

107
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,127
What?

108
00:14:44,463 --> 00:14:46,294
He went crazy at your screen test.

109
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:54,136
I'm damn happy for you and...

110
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,141
i'm happy for myself.

111
00:14:58,544 --> 00:15:00,136
Great! Superb!

112
00:15:00,346 --> 00:15:01,472
Fantastic!

113
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,077
You know to dance, isn't it?

114
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:15,090
I'm out of practice.

115
00:15:15,428 --> 00:15:17,089
Give me two weeks.

116
00:15:26,505 --> 00:15:28,097
Reva...

117
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,434
reva, i don't feel
nice to say that...

118
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,602
...but, the rent of two months
is still pending.

119
00:15:33,713 --> 00:15:35,510
Sorry. What should i do?

120
00:15:35,648 --> 00:15:38,276
Why do you say sorry? It's my fault.

121
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:42,646
If you can give me two more weeks...

122
00:15:55,735 --> 00:15:57,293
hello?
- Hello, reva?

123
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,132
Hi, abhinav here. The bus guy.

124
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:01,667
I got your number from
shaan productions.

125
00:16:01,741 --> 00:16:04,141
Look, there's a new director
called sandesh.

126
00:16:04,243 --> 00:16:06,404
I've got a break in his film.
It's very big film.

127
00:16:06,545 --> 00:16:09,571
And, yes, yes, yes. I've
to know how to dance.

128
00:16:09,682 --> 00:16:11,411
And, i've decided
that i'll learn it.

129
00:16:11,584 --> 00:16:13,245
And, i'll learn it only from you.

130
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:15,250
So, please, don't say no! Okay?

131
00:16:16,422 --> 00:16:18,413
And, yeah! It's not that
i'll learn it for free.

132
00:16:18,557 --> 00:16:21,424
I'll give you the fees. But,
i won't be giving much.

133
00:16:22,261 --> 00:16:25,162
So, please agree! Please,
reva, please!

134
00:16:26,432 --> 00:16:29,265
I've achieved it.

135
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:32,260
It's my shadow.

136
00:16:33,706 --> 00:16:37,267
It's in all my veins.

137
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:41,503
It's in every particle of my body.

138
00:18:12,605 --> 00:18:14,072
Don't stop.

139
00:18:16,475 --> 00:18:20,411
It's just, that i feel
like keep watching.

140
00:18:42,501 --> 00:18:44,093
One thing is for sure.

141
00:18:44,503 --> 00:18:46,437
After watching you dance,
i feel like...

142
00:18:46,505 --> 00:18:48,268
...i can never even reach
till the 'd' of dance.

143
00:18:49,275 --> 00:18:50,606
I won't be able to do this.
It won't happen.

144
00:18:51,377 --> 00:18:53,436
I don't like that word.
- Which?

145
00:18:59,385 --> 00:19:00,374
'No.'

146
00:19:03,322 --> 00:19:04,448
Okay.

147
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:07,052
Point noted.

148
00:19:11,597 --> 00:19:13,064
Where's the music?

149
00:19:13,532 --> 00:19:15,261
Music isn't needed to learn dance.

150
00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:17,460
What?

151
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,060
Raise your hands.

152
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,410
Now?
- Keep standing like that.

153
00:19:44,263 --> 00:19:47,426
Can i lower my hands, now?
- Why?

154
00:19:49,268 --> 00:19:50,428
Is it paining?

155
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,430
No.

156
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:54,097
I'm looking like a fool.

157
00:19:57,443 --> 00:19:58,705
Do you feel that i'm
making you do that...

158
00:19:58,777 --> 00:20:00,108
...so that you should
look like a fool?

159
00:20:02,448 --> 00:20:03,506
No.

160
00:20:04,783 --> 00:20:06,614
Do you trust me?

161
00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:11,517
What else can be the reason
for me to stand here?

162
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:19,118
Who are you?
- What?

163
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:23,622
Did you fall from the sky?
- Goa.

164
00:21:24,296 --> 00:21:25,456
And?

165
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:28,464
The thing, that i want to do...

166
00:21:28,534 --> 00:21:31,298
mama and papa were least
interested in that.

167
00:21:33,606 --> 00:21:36,404
So, i left the house.
And, came here.

168
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:42,140
I know that you won't be asking,
so i'll tell it myself.

169
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:45,139
My parents have expired.

170
00:21:45,484 --> 00:21:47,315
And, i've one sister,
who stays in nainital.

171
00:21:49,321 --> 00:21:51,755
But, there was no question
of staying with her.

172
00:21:52,491 --> 00:21:53,753
Because, i had already
decided that...

173
00:21:53,826 --> 00:21:55,487
...i would be coming to mumbai and...

174
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:57,153
...would be ruling over
this film industry.

175
00:22:03,268 --> 00:22:05,099
I've got a job in nfd computers.

176
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,430
Part-time.

177
00:22:06,572 --> 00:22:08,096
From 4:00 to 7:30.

178
00:22:09,174 --> 00:22:10,266
Job?

179
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,109
I'll get some money.

180
00:22:13,612 --> 00:22:16,274
Whatever i brought with
me; is almost spent.

181
00:22:18,517 --> 00:22:20,109
I can't do a full time job.

182
00:22:22,187 --> 00:22:24,121
As i need time for my dance as well.

183
00:22:32,631 --> 00:22:34,121
Dance!

184
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,129
Want to see a movie?

185
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:47,132
How did you find the film?

186
00:23:47,673 --> 00:23:49,470
Great! Superb!

187
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:51,131
Fantastic!

188
00:23:52,411 --> 00:23:55,312
Action, comedy, romance, tears;
everything was there in it.

189
00:23:55,547 --> 00:23:56,673
That's why, it's a super-hit.

190
00:23:59,551 --> 00:24:01,075
That wasn't the reply
to my question.

191
00:24:03,422 --> 00:24:07,483
Reva, i want to become an actor...

192
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:09,354
...because, i want to
earn loads of fame.

193
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,088
And, money as well.

194
00:24:12,564 --> 00:24:15,260
So, it's in my best interests
that i should quickly learn...

195
00:24:15,334 --> 00:24:18,633
...whatever that is usually
needed over here.

196
00:24:26,512 --> 00:24:28,104
The film was just rubbish.

197
00:24:56,475 --> 00:24:57,533
Are you mad?

198
00:24:57,876 --> 00:24:59,741
You won't be getting such
a big offer too often.

199
00:25:01,613 --> 00:25:03,410
Reva, please take my word
and say yes to it.

200
00:25:05,584 --> 00:25:07,415
Do you have any idea as
to how far will you go...

201
00:25:07,486 --> 00:25:09,078
...by associating with this company.

202
00:25:09,254 --> 00:25:11,085
You can obtain work from
the whole of the world.

203
00:25:11,156 --> 00:25:12,555
Abhi, you know it
that i don't work...

204
00:25:12,624 --> 00:25:14,091
...just for the sake
of obtaining work.

205
00:25:15,427 --> 00:25:17,361
I haven't come here to
earn money or fame.

206
00:25:18,564 --> 00:25:20,088
And, dance...

207
00:25:20,632 --> 00:25:22,429
had i just wanted to dance, then...

208
00:25:22,501 --> 00:25:24,264
...i could have done
it in goa as well.

209
00:25:26,505 --> 00:25:27,563
Abhi...

210
00:25:27,639 --> 00:25:29,436
the form in which i want
to perceive dance...

211
00:25:29,508 --> 00:25:31,772
...is only possible in films.

212
00:25:33,445 --> 00:25:35,606
Lights, sets, set-designs,
costumes, camera...

213
00:25:36,448 --> 00:25:38,643
i want to perceive dance in
my own way through all this.

214
00:25:39,585 --> 00:25:41,109
I want to show it.

215
00:25:43,589 --> 00:25:47,116
And, had i come here just for the
sake of living a routine life...

216
00:25:47,192 --> 00:25:50,628
...then, whatever you said;
might very well apply.

217
00:25:51,663 --> 00:25:53,790
To give what the industry wants.

218
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,134
And, walk off after taking my money.

219
00:25:58,403 --> 00:26:00,234
But, abhi, that is not my objective.

220
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:04,065
Do you know this industry?

221
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:09,244
Do you feel that these people
need your innovation?

222
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,485
Abhi, it's not that
they don't want it.

223
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:22,257
It's just, that they are unable
to see it through my eyes.

224
00:26:24,363 --> 00:26:27,696
And, to show them and explain
them; is my responsibility.

225
00:26:30,302 --> 00:26:33,100
Abhi, do you feel that
whatever i want...

226
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:36,265
can i be able to do it ever?

227
00:26:36,675 --> 00:26:38,108
Seriously?

228
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,104
No.

229
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,114
Reva...

230
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:55,286
the day you get what you want...

231
00:26:56,595 --> 00:26:58,119
i'll be happier than you.

232
00:26:59,298 --> 00:27:00,390
I know.

233
00:28:24,483 --> 00:28:26,075
I like your style.

234
00:28:29,621 --> 00:28:31,748
Have you ever done a film before?
- No.

235
00:28:33,692 --> 00:28:35,091
Very original.

236
00:28:38,563 --> 00:28:40,360
Actually, i want to do something
similar in my film.

237
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:43,266
I've got a song recorded
for my film.

238
00:28:43,502 --> 00:28:45,094
I'll send the cd along with abhi.

239
00:28:46,438 --> 00:28:48,099
Let's see, what you can do.

240
00:29:09,394 --> 00:29:11,658
I've the passion in me, so i'll
face whatever comes ahead.

241
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,658
Whoever comes to face me,
can never be like me.

242
00:29:15,133 --> 00:29:17,658
And, at my feet lies
the whole world.

243
00:29:17,736 --> 00:29:20,466
The whole. The whole.
The whole.

244
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:23,673
I've the passion in me, so i'll
face whatever comes ahead.

245
00:29:24,242 --> 00:29:26,733
Whoever comes to face me,
can never be like me.

246
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:29,611
And, at my feet lies
the whole world.

247
00:29:29,681 --> 00:29:32,616
The whole. The whole.
The whole.

248
00:29:35,253 --> 00:29:36,345
I love it.

249
00:29:36,421 --> 00:29:37,479
Yes!

250
00:31:52,757 --> 00:31:54,156
I love you.

251
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:06,100
I love your eyes.

252
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:09,703
I love your lips. I love your ears.

253
00:32:11,643 --> 00:32:13,110
I love your hair.

254
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,111
I love your coffee.

255
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:19,116
I love your voice.

256
00:32:20,852 --> 00:32:22,114
I love your ear-rings.

257
00:32:23,388 --> 00:32:25,117
I'm not wearing ear-ring.

258
00:32:26,524 --> 00:32:28,287
I know.

259
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,121
But...

260
00:32:30,195 --> 00:32:32,186
when you do, i'm sure
i'll love them.

261
00:32:37,469 --> 00:32:39,130
And, what else?

262
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,132
I love it that you're short.

263
00:32:46,478 --> 00:32:48,605
I love you because you're
very boring.

264
00:32:58,323 --> 00:33:00,154
I love that.

265
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:02,090
Whatever it is.

266
00:33:06,431 --> 00:33:08,092
I love the way you never smile.

267
00:33:40,298 --> 00:33:41,390
So...

268
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:44,128
here's your house.

269
00:33:44,302 --> 00:33:46,463
You're safe, sound and dry.

270
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:50,469
And, i'm out of here. Good night.

271
00:33:50,675 --> 00:33:52,142
Want some coffee?

272
00:34:00,752 --> 00:34:02,083
Abhi...

273
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:14,399
life is uniting with
someone as such.

274
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:26,244
Life is uniting with
someone as such.

275
00:38:28,419 --> 00:38:30,250
No, no.

276
00:38:31,422 --> 00:38:33,253
No, no.

277
00:38:34,258 --> 00:38:36,249
Never ever.

278
00:38:37,095 --> 00:38:40,292
Never ever i deemed it this way.

279
00:38:46,437 --> 00:38:54,503
Life is uniting with
someone as such.

280
00:38:58,116 --> 00:39:06,216
Life is uniting with
someone as such.

281
00:39:08,393 --> 00:39:10,452
No, no.

282
00:39:11,462 --> 00:39:13,555
No, no.

283
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:16,264
Never ever.

284
00:39:17,402 --> 00:39:20,394
Never ever i deemed it this way.

285
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,071
Hey, dance.

286
00:39:26,244 --> 00:39:29,236
Hey, dance.

287
00:39:31,482 --> 00:39:35,248
Hey, dance.

288
00:39:55,106 --> 00:39:58,439
The foot.

289
00:40:00,278 --> 00:40:02,109
When i keep it.

290
00:40:03,448 --> 00:40:10,183
I find that i'm waiting for him.

291
00:40:12,457 --> 00:40:15,620
The foot.

292
00:40:17,462 --> 00:40:19,123
When i keep it.

293
00:40:20,698 --> 00:40:27,297
I find that i'm waiting for him.

294
00:40:29,307 --> 00:40:31,537
Do it and don't stop.

295
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:35,641
And, life will be all set to move.

296
00:40:41,552 --> 00:40:50,153
Life gets united with
someone as such.

297
00:40:53,331 --> 00:41:01,636
Life gets united with
someone as such.

298
00:41:03,641 --> 00:41:06,109
Sometimes, here.

299
00:41:06,511 --> 00:41:09,105
Sometimes, there.

300
00:41:09,514 --> 00:41:12,506
Sometimes, somewhere else.

301
00:41:13,451 --> 00:41:15,715
It gets united.

302
00:41:16,287 --> 00:41:18,653
Hey, dance.

303
00:41:21,459 --> 00:41:24,394
Hey, dance.

304
00:41:27,298 --> 00:41:30,290
Hey, dance.

305
00:41:33,471 --> 00:41:36,304
Hey, dance.

306
00:42:47,478 --> 00:42:49,139
Camera...

307
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,812
...is gradually zooming
into your face.

308
00:42:54,552 --> 00:42:58,488
And, your gaze is fixed
far away on the traffic.

309
00:43:00,424 --> 00:43:02,085
Suddenly, the camera
is swish-panned!

310
00:43:05,429 --> 00:43:08,489
Great. - It is to be seen with
sound and music.

311
00:43:10,635 --> 00:43:13,103
You have to give a trial of
the costume too. Don't forget.

312
00:43:13,604 --> 00:43:15,094
And we have to remove
the instances...

313
00:43:15,273 --> 00:43:16,433
prasad will look after everything.

314
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,699
And yes...

315
00:43:17,775 --> 00:43:21,108
tell that girl that she cannot
do this film. - Which girl?

316
00:43:21,512 --> 00:43:24,709
That... that choreographer of yours.
- But...

317
00:43:26,651 --> 00:43:28,516
but why?

318
00:43:30,388 --> 00:43:31,616
Because the heroine ayesha wants...

319
00:43:31,689 --> 00:43:33,179
...to work with the dance
director shaheen.

320
00:44:17,702 --> 00:44:19,260
Do you want to see sandesh's song?

321
00:44:31,582 --> 00:44:34,107
According to your character in...

322
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:37,109
...the film you shouldn't
dance at all.

323
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:43,123
The way i am seeing it...

324
00:44:45,463 --> 00:44:48,125
think that there is such a set.

325
00:45:07,351 --> 00:45:09,080
The world is at your feet.

326
00:45:45,723 --> 00:45:47,122
In senses...

327
00:45:48,459 --> 00:45:50,188
who will be?

328
00:45:50,661 --> 00:45:54,859
Like me...

329
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:23,092
there is fire in the senses.

330
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,422
It is to be seen...
whatever will be.

331
00:46:24,495 --> 00:46:27,430
There will be nobody like
me who will face me.

332
00:46:27,498 --> 00:46:30,433
The whole world is at my feet.

333
00:46:30,568 --> 00:46:33,162
The whole...

334
00:46:33,671 --> 00:46:35,104
there is fire in the senses.

335
00:46:35,172 --> 00:46:36,434
It is to be seen...
whatever will be.

336
00:46:36,574 --> 00:46:39,270
There will be nobody like
me who will face me.

337
00:46:39,443 --> 00:46:42,378
The whole world is at my feet.

338
00:46:42,513 --> 00:46:45,277
The whole...

339
00:46:58,195 --> 00:46:59,457
you have such a colour
and attitude...

340
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:00,554
we haven't heard or seen it ever.

341
00:47:00,664 --> 00:47:03,599
The one who is with you...
will bloom.

342
00:47:04,135 --> 00:47:06,603
Your colour is such...
it falls on everyone.

343
00:47:07,071 --> 00:47:09,665
Yours...

344
00:47:10,074 --> 00:47:11,405
you have such a colour
and attitude...

345
00:47:11,475 --> 00:47:12,669
we haven't heard or seen it ever.

346
00:47:13,144 --> 00:47:15,578
The one who is with you...
will bloom.

347
00:47:16,247 --> 00:47:18,681
Your colour is such...
it falls on everyone.

348
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:21,482
Yours...

349
00:47:37,601 --> 00:47:40,092
i don't want anything incomplete.

350
00:47:40,437 --> 00:47:43,167
I want everything.

351
00:47:43,574 --> 00:47:46,099
Whatever is the best is here...

352
00:47:46,443 --> 00:47:48,104
here...

353
00:47:49,613 --> 00:47:52,275
i don't want anything incomplete.

354
00:47:52,516 --> 00:47:55,280
I want everything.

355
00:47:55,553 --> 00:47:58,283
Whatever is the best is here...

356
00:47:58,455 --> 00:48:01,049
here...

357
00:48:01,592 --> 00:48:04,322
how much ever strength
anyone has...

358
00:48:04,395 --> 00:48:07,387
the person gets more.

359
00:48:07,531 --> 00:48:10,329
Who will live on today,
tomorrow and day after?

360
00:48:10,501 --> 00:48:13,402
Never...

361
00:48:13,604 --> 00:48:16,402
how much ever strength
anyone has...

362
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:19,407
the person gets more.

363
00:48:19,543 --> 00:48:22,341
Who will live on today,
tomorrow and day after?

364
00:48:22,479 --> 00:48:25,243
Never...

365
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:47,430
just once...

366
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:49,567
see what she has done just once.

367
00:48:53,577 --> 00:48:55,602
It must be fantastic.
- It is.

368
00:48:57,514 --> 00:48:59,448
Abhi... you understand this.

369
00:49:01,385 --> 00:49:03,046
The industry doesn't
work just on talent.

370
00:49:05,322 --> 00:49:07,051
The choreographer shaheen khan.

371
00:49:07,591 --> 00:49:09,058
He is very ordinary.

372
00:49:10,461 --> 00:49:12,053
But his networking is very strong.

373
00:49:13,397 --> 00:49:15,058
The right parties...

374
00:49:16,467 --> 00:49:18,059
page three.

375
00:49:18,569 --> 00:49:20,230
You know what i am talking
about? Zee... screen.

376
00:49:20,404 --> 00:49:22,065
He has got two filmfare awards.

377
00:49:23,807 --> 00:49:25,399
The producers think
that the value of...

378
00:49:25,476 --> 00:49:27,410
...the movie increases
due to his being in it.

379
00:49:31,482 --> 00:49:33,245
And... he is a good friend
of the superstar ayesha.

380
00:49:35,352 --> 00:49:40,688
And i have got this first
break due to all these.

381
00:49:46,664 --> 00:49:48,097
It was my mistake.

382
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,568
I was excited looking at her dance.
And i committed to her.

383
00:50:04,782 --> 00:50:06,113
Why are you so quiet?

384
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,110
You are quiet since evening.

385
00:50:11,522 --> 00:50:13,114
Is something wrong?

386
00:50:17,461 --> 00:50:21,727
What happened, abhi? What's wrong?

387
00:50:24,468 --> 00:50:27,460
They have taken some other
dancer in your place.

388
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:48,651
Not because sandesh didn't
like your place.

389
00:50:50,561 --> 00:50:52,324
But ayesha...
- i don't want to hear.

390
00:50:56,633 --> 00:50:59,568
If they don't want me.
They don't want me.

391
00:51:02,573 --> 00:51:05,440
I am not concerned with
their problems.

392
00:51:17,654 --> 00:51:20,122
I tried to convince sandesh...
- abhi, i...

393
00:51:23,594 --> 00:51:25,118
we will not speak about this.

394
00:51:26,296 --> 00:51:28,127
As far as i am concerned.

395
00:51:28,665 --> 00:51:30,132
This topic is over.

396
00:51:46,583 --> 00:51:48,141
Even i will leave this film.

397
00:51:52,489 --> 00:51:54,150
Don't talk nonsense. Abhi.

398
00:51:54,825 --> 00:51:57,658
Our work and we are different.

399
00:51:58,629 --> 00:52:00,153
Don't mix the two.

400
00:52:31,462 --> 00:52:33,123
I want to be alone for a while.

401
00:52:44,741 --> 00:52:46,140
Dance...

402
00:52:50,547 --> 00:52:52,139
dance...

403
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,149
dance...

404
00:53:01,758 --> 00:53:03,589
dance...

405
00:53:31,722 --> 00:53:35,715
you wanted to be alone.
So i left you.

406
00:53:39,796 --> 00:53:41,457
Now i want to be with you.

407
00:53:55,679 --> 00:54:01,481
It has started relating
with someone like this...

408
00:54:02,819 --> 00:54:04,081
this life.

409
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:12,687
It has started relating
with someone like this...

410
00:54:14,531 --> 00:54:16,089
this life.

411
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,558
Should i bring more vegetable?

412
00:54:17,634 --> 00:54:19,431
No... no...

413
00:54:20,437 --> 00:54:22,428
no... no...

414
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,374
never... never...

415
00:54:26,376 --> 00:54:29,607
i had never thought about it.

416
00:54:31,782 --> 00:54:33,113
Dance...

417
00:54:37,588 --> 00:54:39,112
dance...

418
00:54:43,594 --> 00:54:45,118
dance...

419
00:54:49,299 --> 00:54:51,130
dance...

420
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,422
there is fire in the senses.

421
00:55:18,495 --> 00:55:20,087
It is to be seen...
whatever will be.

422
00:55:20,263 --> 00:55:24,097
There will be nobody like
me who will face me.

423
00:55:24,267 --> 00:55:27,100
The whole world is at my feet.

424
00:55:27,371 --> 00:55:29,601
The whole...

425
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,600
there is fire in the senses.

426
00:55:31,675 --> 00:55:33,108
It is to be seen...
whatever will be.

427
00:55:33,276 --> 00:55:35,836
There will be nobody like
me who will face me.

428
00:55:36,313 --> 00:55:39,111
The whole world is at my feet.

429
00:55:39,282 --> 00:55:42,274
The whole...

430
00:55:44,655 --> 00:55:46,122
it looks like a circus.

431
00:55:46,657 --> 00:55:49,626
Sir. The public will
like it. Guaranteed.

432
00:55:50,394 --> 00:55:51,520
Sir...

433
00:55:51,595 --> 00:55:53,290
there was a similar song
in kal raho na no.

434
00:55:53,397 --> 00:55:55,126
It had worked for just fifty weeks.

435
00:55:57,401 --> 00:55:58,459
It is bad...

436
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:02,060
but it is business.

437
00:56:04,341 --> 00:56:07,071
The whole...

438
00:56:13,617 --> 00:56:16,347
cut it. Yes. That was
a very nice shot, yes.

439
00:56:16,586 --> 00:56:18,076
Not now. Get out.

440
00:56:18,422 --> 00:56:19,480
This was nice. We will take the...

441
00:56:19,556 --> 00:56:21,148
...next shot from up there.

442
00:57:14,678 --> 00:57:16,077
Yes...
- autograph please.

443
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:22,480
He is so cute.
- I know.

444
00:57:50,447 --> 00:57:52,506
Abhi... is it so important for you?
- What?

445
00:57:53,183 --> 00:57:54,275
That everyone should know you.

446
00:57:54,384 --> 00:57:56,113
And that everyone should
appreciate you?

447
00:57:57,788 --> 00:58:00,655
See. Everyone doesn't want
to become like you.

448
00:58:01,224 --> 00:58:03,215
I am a normal man. I don't
want to become god.

449
00:58:03,593 --> 00:58:06,061
I want many fans that come
and take my autograph.

450
00:58:06,396 --> 00:58:09,388
I want many awards and i want
a lot of money. Okay?

451
00:58:09,466 --> 00:58:10,524
Don't say things that
you don't mean.

452
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,535
No. I mean it. - You don't.
- I do. - you don't. - i do.

453
00:58:14,237 --> 00:58:15,397
You don't.
- Yes, i do.

454
00:58:16,406 --> 00:58:19,239
You don't.
- No, i don't.

455
00:58:40,363 --> 00:58:43,423
Hey... hey... move...

456
00:58:52,442 --> 00:58:57,106
autograph... autograph please...

457
00:59:01,585 --> 00:59:03,052
please... autograph...

458
00:59:48,632 --> 00:59:50,099
hello?

459
00:59:51,101 --> 00:59:52,363
Yes. I am reva here.

460
00:59:56,606 --> 00:59:58,437
Reva...
- i got a call from a producer.

461
00:59:58,508 --> 01:00:00,100
He is very excited
looking at my work.

462
01:00:00,644 --> 01:00:02,168
Wow... excited?

463
01:00:02,279 --> 01:00:03,507
Of course i am excited.

464
01:00:03,647 --> 01:00:04,705
Congrats...

465
01:00:04,781 --> 01:00:06,646
excuse me, sir?
- Yes? - the shot is ready.

466
01:00:07,651 --> 01:00:09,448
Anyway. See. My shot is ready.

467
01:00:10,287 --> 01:00:12,118
I will meet you later, okay? Bye.

468
01:00:13,623 --> 01:00:15,113
Please... please reva have a seat.

469
01:00:15,191 --> 01:00:17,125
I am rakesh.
- Thank you, sir. - yes. - please.

470
01:00:19,296 --> 01:00:21,127
Anyways.

471
01:00:21,298 --> 01:00:23,198
You must not have heard about me.

472
01:00:25,468 --> 01:00:27,299
Because i haven't made
a film till today.

473
01:00:27,604 --> 01:00:29,469
But i want to make a film.
A different film.

474
01:00:29,539 --> 01:00:31,734
A film which stands out.

475
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:35,801
What will you have? Tea,
coffee or cold drink?

476
01:00:36,146 --> 01:00:37,306
No, nothing. Thank you.

477
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:39,314
No. You will have to take
something. Coffee?

478
01:00:39,482 --> 01:00:40,540
Good.

479
01:00:41,718 --> 01:00:43,151
Yes, send two coffees.

480
01:00:48,491 --> 01:00:51,426
I have seen your cd. I have
seen your show reel.

481
01:00:51,628 --> 01:00:53,619
Superb. Original. Believe me.

482
01:00:53,697 --> 01:00:55,688
Mind blowing, it was.
- Thank you, sir.

483
01:00:56,433 --> 01:00:59,493
Even we have recorded excellent
songs for our film.

484
01:01:00,503 --> 01:01:02,437
The poet sameer is doing the music.
- Okay.

485
01:01:03,106 --> 01:01:05,370
And we want the newest style.

486
01:01:05,642 --> 01:01:07,269
And you will be giving it to us.

487
01:01:09,612 --> 01:01:11,603
This is the script. This is the cd.

488
01:01:12,515 --> 01:01:14,278
Once you understand the script.

489
01:01:14,684 --> 01:01:17,619
You will be able to put more
motion into your dances.

490
01:01:18,288 --> 01:01:19,380
Yes!

491
01:01:19,522 --> 01:01:22,286
The kind of style
that i saw in you...

492
01:01:22,359 --> 01:01:25,851
reva... think that you were
made for this film.

493
01:01:28,465 --> 01:01:30,524
Okay, sir. I will listen
to the songs.

494
01:01:30,667 --> 01:01:32,532
And i will get something
ready and meet you then.

495
01:01:32,736 --> 01:01:36,137
I will call you, sir.
- Reva... i have ordered coffee.

496
01:01:36,539 --> 01:01:40,475
Here. The coffee has come. Have
it and go. - Okay, sir.

497
01:01:51,488 --> 01:01:53,149
Reva...

498
01:01:54,324 --> 01:01:55,484
abhi...

499
01:01:55,558 --> 01:01:57,321
i have heard that you
know abhi very well.

500
01:01:58,495 --> 01:01:59,553
Yes. Sir.

501
01:01:59,629 --> 01:02:01,096
Yes.

502
01:02:01,431 --> 01:02:03,092
The hero has a strong
role in this script.

503
01:02:03,366 --> 01:02:05,425
Very... it means... it is
a fit role for abhi.

504
01:02:06,703 --> 01:02:08,261
Sir. Is abhi working in your film?

505
01:02:08,571 --> 01:02:10,095
That is what i want too.

506
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:13,100
But reva, you know. Abhi
is so busy nowadays.

507
01:02:13,276 --> 01:02:15,437
It is very difficult to meet him.
Therefore... i was thinking.

508
01:02:15,578 --> 01:02:18,445
If you tell abhi to read
our script once, maybe...

509
01:02:23,386 --> 01:02:25,650
sir... it isn't my work to lead
the actor to the script.

510
01:02:26,389 --> 01:02:28,289
You are misunderstanding me.
It isn't anything like that.

511
01:02:29,526 --> 01:02:32,120
Please don't misunderstand
me. It is like this.

512
01:02:32,295 --> 01:02:34,126
If a star like abhi works
in our film once...

513
01:02:34,197 --> 01:02:36,131
...four people will invest
money in the project.

514
01:02:36,466 --> 01:02:38,457
What after that? The
film will be made.

515
01:02:40,303 --> 01:02:41,463
Just once...

516
01:02:41,671 --> 01:02:43,298
you make abhi say 'yes'.

517
01:02:44,808 --> 01:02:46,673
Your work will done and
ours will be done too.

518
01:02:51,481 --> 01:02:53,142
What do you say, reva?

519
01:02:53,216 --> 01:02:55,150
Will you speak to abhi?

520
01:03:01,591 --> 01:03:03,081
No, sir.

521
01:03:04,427 --> 01:03:06,088
Thank you very much for your time.

522
01:03:15,438 --> 01:03:19,499
Everything makes a difference.

523
01:03:19,576 --> 01:03:22,704
I guess you don't know who i am.

524
01:04:06,422 --> 01:04:13,419
From today... your feet won't
be on the floor ever. - What?

525
01:04:16,599 --> 01:04:19,432
Because your prince with
the blue horse has come.

526
01:04:29,512 --> 01:04:31,104
A car.

527
01:04:33,449 --> 01:04:35,508
A brand new car is waiting
by your door.

528
01:04:35,652 --> 01:04:37,620
And it is waiting
for you restlessly.

529
01:04:39,289 --> 01:04:41,382
So go quickly and change. We
are going for a drive.

530
01:04:41,457 --> 01:04:43,118
Come on.

531
01:04:45,795 --> 01:04:48,855
Hello, mr. Abhinav.
Hi! I saw your film.

532
01:04:49,132 --> 01:04:51,293
It was very good.
- Thank you.

533
01:04:51,734 --> 01:04:54,532
Reva... your three month's
rent is pending.

534
01:04:54,637 --> 01:04:56,468
Even the last month you...
- if you could give me...

535
01:04:56,539 --> 01:04:58,473
...a couple of weeks
more. I thought...

536
01:04:58,541 --> 01:05:00,236
...that the money would come in.

537
01:05:01,477 --> 01:05:03,240
How much is it?
- Nine thousand.

538
01:05:05,415 --> 01:05:07,076
Abhi...
- relax.

539
01:05:07,617 --> 01:05:12,350
Here it is. Take the rent
from me from now on.

540
01:05:12,422 --> 01:05:14,413
Okay? Come on. Come on!

541
01:05:21,631 --> 01:05:24,259
Here is your car and
this is your husband.

542
01:05:24,334 --> 01:05:26,268
I mean... your chauffer. Come on.

543
01:05:26,769 --> 01:05:28,259
You shouldn't have done like this.

544
01:05:28,638 --> 01:05:32,096
Oh! Shut up! Come on! Come on!

545
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:36,442
Did you see the pickup? Oh!
That's a great car.

546
01:05:38,448 --> 01:05:40,609
And the suspension. The
road is butter, butter.

547
01:05:43,453 --> 01:05:44,511
Power steering.

548
01:05:44,621 --> 01:05:46,282
I can move the car with one finger.

549
01:05:53,463 --> 01:05:55,454
What happened?
Why are you so silent?

550
01:05:56,699 --> 01:05:58,132
Nothing.

551
01:05:59,469 --> 01:06:01,460
Now don't tell me you are
still thinking about the rent.

552
01:06:14,817 --> 01:06:16,250
Okay, so what should i have done?

553
01:06:16,486 --> 01:06:18,078
I should have seen the
drama standing there?

554
01:06:19,088 --> 01:06:20,350
Abhi... why don't you
try to understand?

555
01:06:20,423 --> 01:06:22,084
Reva... you try to understand.

556
01:06:23,426 --> 01:06:26,259
We love each other. We're together.

557
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:30,263
Why do you make an issue of
all these small things?

558
01:06:30,366 --> 01:06:32,095
Why?

559
01:06:38,641 --> 01:06:40,108
Fine.

560
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:42,100
I am sorry.

561
01:06:43,379 --> 01:06:47,645
Can we forget all this right
now, please? - Yes.

562
01:06:47,717 --> 01:06:49,116
Thank you.

563
01:06:51,187 --> 01:06:54,384
Okay... what happened about that...
- who?

564
01:06:55,391 --> 01:06:57,120
That producer. Who wanted
to see your show reel.

565
01:06:58,127 --> 01:06:59,458
They didn't want me.
They wanted you.

566
01:07:06,569 --> 01:07:08,059
What do you mean?

567
01:07:09,339 --> 01:07:10,601
They came to know from somewhere...

568
01:07:10,673 --> 01:07:12,402
...that i knew you. So they wanted...

569
01:07:12,475 --> 01:07:13,669
...that i bring you into the film...

570
01:07:13,743 --> 01:07:15,574
then they would give me the work.

571
01:07:24,687 --> 01:07:26,086
Okay.

572
01:07:26,255 --> 01:07:28,086
I will meet them.

573
01:07:29,092 --> 01:07:30,252
Why?

574
01:07:32,595 --> 01:07:34,620
I don't know. Maybe they
have a nice story.

575
01:07:34,697 --> 01:07:36,358
Tell them that i will meet them.

576
01:07:37,367 --> 01:07:39,096
You tell them yourself.
You call them yourself.

577
01:07:58,621 --> 01:08:00,111
Why are you so difficult, reva?

578
01:08:02,458 --> 01:08:04,551
What is the problem?
Can't we help each other?

579
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:09,059
Abhi. I don't need anyone's help.

580
01:08:12,402 --> 01:08:14,393
I am telling this once.
I won't repeat it.

581
01:08:17,407 --> 01:08:20,069
I won't sign any film
which is based...

582
01:08:20,143 --> 01:08:22,134
...on your recommendations
or contacts.

583
01:08:23,546 --> 01:08:25,070
Not now. Not ever.

584
01:08:26,682 --> 01:08:28,616
Abhi those people don't understand...

585
01:08:28,684 --> 01:08:31,482
...my work and my ideas. Not at all.

586
01:08:32,588 --> 01:08:34,078
I cannot work with these people.

587
01:08:34,524 --> 01:08:36,082
And i thought that you
understood all this.

588
01:08:36,259 --> 01:08:38,750
Yes, i understand all this. But...

589
01:08:39,095 --> 01:08:40,585
...there is a limit to
your adamancy too.

590
01:08:40,696 --> 01:08:43,096
What do think? The industry
works just like this?

591
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,830
People invest lakhs and
crores into a movie.

592
01:08:49,105 --> 01:08:51,096
Even they have to see their
commercial interest.

593
01:08:51,507 --> 01:08:52,565
They have to...

594
01:08:52,642 --> 01:08:54,303
they have to bow to the
audience's tastes.

595
01:08:54,377 --> 01:08:56,277
They cannot survive like you.
On thin air.

596
01:08:56,779 --> 01:08:58,269
She has come

597
01:08:58,781 --> 01:09:00,214
forget all this drama, reva.

598
01:09:00,383 --> 01:09:01,543
And look at reality.

599
01:09:02,452 --> 01:09:04,545
Abhi, forget it. You
never understood.

600
01:09:05,321 --> 01:09:06,583
What do you mean to say now?

601
01:09:07,223 --> 01:09:10,590
That you are the only real artiste,
bathed in milk?

602
01:09:11,661 --> 01:09:14,562
And the rest are useless
and good for nothing.

603
01:09:16,065 --> 01:09:18,056
I am talking about myself.
Not about others.

604
01:09:23,339 --> 01:09:24,397
Who are you?

605
01:09:26,409 --> 01:09:28,070
What do you think about yourself?

606
01:09:28,478 --> 01:09:31,242
That people will move
around you with work...

607
01:09:31,314 --> 01:09:33,680
...and you will kick them for
your great principles?

608
01:09:33,749 --> 01:09:35,239
Please, don't be ridiculous.

609
01:09:36,085 --> 01:09:38,076
Just forget it.

610
01:09:41,491 --> 01:09:43,083
We are very different. Abhi.

611
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:46,093
We are very different.

612
01:09:53,269 --> 01:09:55,601
I am successful today because
i am not a fool like you.

613
01:09:58,641 --> 01:10:00,108
And...

614
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:04,446
because of my principles,
i don't want to starve.

615
01:10:05,281 --> 01:10:08,273
On the contrary, i am
famous and rich today.

616
01:10:13,456 --> 01:10:14,514
What do you think?

617
01:10:14,657 --> 01:10:17,285
By making me away from yourself...

618
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,624
...and relating me to the world,
you will hurt me? Is it?

619
01:10:21,631 --> 01:10:23,121
No way.

620
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:24,291
Not with me.

621
01:10:24,667 --> 01:10:26,396
I have reached here
with my hard work.

622
01:10:26,669 --> 01:10:29,297
And no one can take it away from me.

623
01:10:29,472 --> 01:10:32,464
Not even you, with this
great talent of yours.

624
01:10:50,226 --> 01:10:52,160
Reva...

625
01:10:56,165 --> 01:10:58,156
reva...

626
01:10:58,701 --> 01:11:01,499
dance...

627
01:11:04,273 --> 01:11:06,104
dance...

628
01:11:11,647 --> 01:11:12,705
sir... it will take twenty minutes...

629
01:11:12,782 --> 01:11:14,443
...for the shot to be ready, okay?

630
01:13:52,641 --> 01:13:55,405
Excuse me... sir. Excuse me... sir.

631
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:59,744
Sir, my name is lakshmi. I am
waiting for you since the last 2 hrs.

632
01:14:00,416 --> 01:14:03,613
Oh. Come in. Come in.
- No, sir. I am really...

633
01:14:03,686 --> 01:14:05,415
just come in, i am really...
- just come in. It's raining.

634
01:14:06,422 --> 01:14:07,480
Thank you, sir.

635
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:10,251
I am so sorry, sir. I am
a costume designer sir.

636
01:14:10,426 --> 01:14:12,621
I can make anything. Sir.
Anything you want.

637
01:14:13,162 --> 01:14:16,256
Just... try... sir... you...
please help me, sir.

638
01:14:20,436 --> 01:14:22,267
Abhi. I don't want anyone's help.

639
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:26,431
I will not sign any film which...

640
01:14:26,509 --> 01:14:29,103
...is based on your contacts
and recommendations.

641
01:14:33,649 --> 01:14:36,447
If i help you... will it be wrong?

642
01:14:37,386 --> 01:14:39,445
Wrong? No sir, why?

643
01:14:40,289 --> 01:14:43,281
Everyone wants someone's
help, isn't it, sir?

644
01:14:47,296 --> 01:14:48,456
Why doesn't she understand this?

645
01:14:49,298 --> 01:14:51,459
What, sir? I am sorry.

646
01:14:56,205 --> 01:14:57,399
Lakshmi. Meet me tomorrow.

647
01:14:57,606 --> 01:14:58,732
We will work something out.

648
01:14:59,475 --> 01:15:01,067
Really, sir?
- Yes.

649
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:03,535
Thank you, sir. Thank
you so much sir.

650
01:15:03,612 --> 01:15:05,239
Bye, good night.

651
01:15:09,752 --> 01:15:11,083
Bye, sir.

652
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:12,545
Hello, sir.

653
01:15:12,621 --> 01:15:13,679
Sir, my name is reva. I had...

654
01:15:13,756 --> 01:15:15,246
...talked to you over the
phone today morning.

655
01:15:16,425 --> 01:15:19,758
Reva...
- yes. - sit down. - thank you.

656
01:15:22,097 --> 01:15:24,258
What did i say after i heard
her voice on the phone?

657
01:15:24,433 --> 01:15:29,302
Yes? - What did i say?
- Yes sir. Yes. Sir.

658
01:15:29,371 --> 01:15:32,602
When her voice is so good,
now beautiful will she be?

659
01:15:34,443 --> 01:15:36,638
If the voice is good,
the girl is good too.

660
01:15:37,713 --> 01:15:39,578
Have you brought the photographs?
- No, sir.

661
01:15:39,648 --> 01:15:41,115
- Sir. I am a choreographer.

662
01:15:43,519 --> 01:15:45,384
You are star heroine material.

663
01:15:47,389 --> 01:15:52,292
Don't be so innocent
too. I can make.

664
01:15:55,664 --> 01:15:58,132
Heroine.
- Yes. Sir. Yes, sir.

665
01:16:00,469 --> 01:16:02,061
Cent percent.

666
01:16:08,244 --> 01:16:10,075
Sir, phone.
- I will talk later.

667
01:16:11,747 --> 01:16:13,237
Hey...

668
01:16:15,417 --> 01:16:17,351
how did that rajesh look when
he came the first time?

669
01:16:19,255 --> 01:16:21,086
Raju...

670
01:16:24,426 --> 01:16:26,087
body...

671
01:16:27,429 --> 01:16:29,090
you have a nice body.

672
01:16:31,267 --> 01:16:33,633
Have you learnt acting?

673
01:16:35,271 --> 01:16:38,263
I don't want to act.
I am a choreographer.

674
01:16:38,374 --> 01:16:41,104
I have heard that your film
needs a choreographer.

675
01:16:41,277 --> 01:16:43,268
I had talked to you
in the morning and...

676
01:16:43,379 --> 01:16:45,279
what are you talking about?
You are a heroine material.

677
01:16:45,347 --> 01:16:47,372
Why are you wasting yourself?

678
01:16:47,583 --> 01:16:53,283
There is no hurry. We will
know each other nicely.

679
01:16:53,389 --> 01:16:59,794
I have an office. Come there.
In the night.

680
01:17:00,529 --> 01:17:02,463
There is a room there.
There is an ac there.

681
01:17:02,598 --> 01:17:08,059
We will sit there
and speak... openly.

682
01:17:09,738 --> 01:17:11,069
You understand, don't you?

683
01:17:12,241 --> 01:17:14,072
Excuse me.

684
01:17:22,151 --> 01:17:25,484
Call kamla.
- Yes. Sir.

685
01:17:31,493 --> 01:17:33,085
Hey, is the shot ready?

686
01:17:34,163 --> 01:17:37,690
This is a balloon of blood.

687
01:17:40,502 --> 01:17:43,596
This is a balloon of blood.

688
01:17:46,842 --> 01:17:50,278
It wanders around day and night.

689
01:18:00,456 --> 01:18:03,220
This is a balloon of blood.

690
01:18:06,528 --> 01:18:11,397
It wanders around day and night.

691
01:18:13,635 --> 01:18:15,068
It wanders!

692
01:18:19,608 --> 01:18:23,237
People have called
it a vagabond.

693
01:18:26,515 --> 01:18:29,416
People with a heart have called
it a vagrant.

694
01:18:29,485 --> 01:18:35,287
Yet others have
called it an ember.

695
01:18:39,561 --> 01:18:42,496
People have called
it a vagabond.

696
01:18:42,631 --> 01:18:46,590
While the happy go lucky
have termed it as an ember.

697
01:18:49,605 --> 01:18:51,266
You and i have drunk.

698
01:18:52,574 --> 01:18:54,599
Drunk in happiness and sorrow.

699
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:00,373
Friend... it is...

700
01:19:01,583 --> 01:19:06,213
a fountain!

701
01:19:09,224 --> 01:19:11,055
Dance...

702
01:19:12,061 --> 01:19:14,052
show us your dance.

703
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:17,059
Beauty... dance...

704
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,227
aroma... dance...

705
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:23,069
dance... thunder...

706
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:28,232
dance the dance of seduction.

707
01:19:29,578 --> 01:19:31,409
The poisonous dance.

708
01:19:32,581 --> 01:19:34,071
Dance...

709
01:19:37,419 --> 01:19:40,684
this is a balloon of blood.

710
01:19:52,434 --> 01:19:56,598
It sets afire to half the body.

711
01:19:59,174 --> 01:20:02,837
It makes the incomplete
mind insane.

712
01:20:05,647 --> 01:20:10,778
In the veins of breath,
it breaks it's life.

713
01:20:16,725 --> 01:20:23,130
In your heart, it disappears
my reflection.

714
01:20:31,673 --> 01:20:33,140
Dance.

715
01:20:34,309 --> 01:20:36,140
Dance unconscious.

716
01:20:37,546 --> 01:20:39,138
Dance restless.

717
01:20:40,816 --> 01:20:42,477
Dance without sadness.

718
01:20:43,752 --> 01:20:45,310
Dance exquisitely.

719
01:20:47,556 --> 01:20:52,493
Dance without customs.

720
01:20:53,662 --> 01:20:55,323
Poisonous dance.

721
01:20:57,566 --> 01:21:01,263
We are lost in your love.

722
01:21:02,504 --> 01:21:06,702
We are lost in your love.

723
01:21:08,443 --> 01:21:12,379
God made you. We are yours.

724
01:21:13,448 --> 01:21:17,509
We are lost in your love.

725
01:21:18,654 --> 01:21:22,715
We are lost in your love.

726
01:21:24,459 --> 01:21:28,395
God made you. We are yours.

727
01:21:29,398 --> 01:21:34,461
We are lost in your love.
- You look very handsome.

728
01:21:34,670 --> 01:21:39,300
We are lost in your love.

729
01:21:41,310 --> 01:21:43,141
Thanks.

730
01:21:46,315 --> 01:21:48,146
And how do i seem?

731
01:21:54,423 --> 01:21:56,152
Great.

732
01:21:56,692 --> 01:22:01,493
Fantastic. Superb.
You look anarkali's mother.

733
01:22:02,097 --> 01:22:06,090
Do i seem old?

734
01:22:06,268 --> 01:22:07,428
Sorry.

735
01:22:07,502 --> 01:22:09,094
You seem very beautiful.

736
01:22:09,771 --> 01:22:12,262
Okay, payal is throwing
a party today.

737
01:22:12,441 --> 01:22:13,567
Will you come with me?

738
01:22:14,443 --> 01:22:15,501
Payal, who?

739
01:22:15,577 --> 01:22:16,635
Payal... that socialite.

740
01:22:16,712 --> 01:22:18,509
I have heard, sir, richard
gere is coming there too.

741
01:22:18,647 --> 01:22:22,845
It will be fun. Promise.
Let's go. Please.

742
01:22:23,518 --> 01:22:25,110
Please... please... please...

743
01:22:35,731 --> 01:22:38,131
hello? - Hello, reva. Reva,
this is sandesh.

744
01:22:39,635 --> 01:22:41,125
Reva, i have a friend, diwakar.

745
01:22:42,204 --> 01:22:44,729
Shaan music industries?
The owner's son.

746
01:22:46,541 --> 01:22:48,475
He is a very intelligent man.

747
01:22:49,678 --> 01:22:51,475
He met me and he told me that...

748
01:22:51,546 --> 01:22:54,310
...he wants to make a music video.

749
01:22:54,683 --> 01:22:58,312
On the theme of dance.
I remembered you.

750
01:22:59,187 --> 01:23:02,679
Yes. I told him about you.
He wants to meet you.

751
01:23:26,648 --> 01:23:28,115
What is the meaning of doing...

752
01:23:28,183 --> 01:23:30,117
...something different
to seem different?

753
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:33,611
I don't say that one
should be different.

754
01:23:34,122 --> 01:23:36,113
I am saying that one
should be right.

755
01:23:36,658 --> 01:23:38,717
Every song has its own tempo.

756
01:23:39,394 --> 01:23:41,123
Every dance has its own reason.

757
01:23:41,463 --> 01:23:43,522
We do not set this reason and tempo.

758
01:23:43,732 --> 01:23:46,132
The song itself decides
it and makes an identity.

759
01:23:46,301 --> 01:23:47,393
Just like that.

760
01:23:47,469 --> 01:23:49,130
Even your music video should...

761
01:23:49,204 --> 01:23:51,468
...have an identity too.
- What?

762
01:23:52,474 --> 01:23:54,874
To know this, we should know
the reason of the song first.

763
01:23:59,414 --> 01:24:02,247
Your thoughts... the
people will like it.

764
01:24:03,418 --> 01:24:05,079
What guarantee can you
give me about that?

765
01:24:10,092 --> 01:24:12,083
There is no guarantee for that.

766
01:24:22,604 --> 01:24:24,094
Your thoughts are very different.

767
01:24:36,284 --> 01:24:37,444
And ahead too.

768
01:24:39,654 --> 01:24:41,121
It is very ahead.

769
01:24:46,795 --> 01:24:48,456
I can't say that i understood...

770
01:24:48,530 --> 01:24:50,122
...fully what you are trying to say.

771
01:24:51,533 --> 01:24:53,524
But i can say...

772
01:24:53,602 --> 01:24:56,127
...that your thoughts and
respect for dance...

773
01:24:56,204 --> 01:25:00,800
...your understanding
is much more than me.

774
01:25:06,815 --> 01:25:08,077
Okay. Reva.

775
01:25:08,483 --> 01:25:10,075
Whatever you want to do...

776
01:25:10,152 --> 01:25:12,347
...however you want to
do it. Let's do it.

777
01:25:12,421 --> 01:25:15,618
The recording of the songs.
Music. Sets.

778
01:25:16,091 --> 01:25:18,082
Everything will be done
like how you want it.

779
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:21,491
We will have rehearsals
and then shoot. Okay?

780
01:25:25,667 --> 01:25:27,100
Thank you.

781
01:26:28,830 --> 01:26:31,355
Reva, it is impossible for any
other girl than you to do this.

782
01:26:31,433 --> 01:26:33,264
I don't understand.
Means?

783
01:26:34,369 --> 01:26:36,428
I mean... you will have to
act in this music video.

784
01:26:36,605 --> 01:26:38,436
Absolutely. The expressions
that you are showing...

785
01:26:38,507 --> 01:26:40,441
...the type of dance
that you are doing...

786
01:26:40,509 --> 01:26:42,101
...from where will we bring all this?

787
01:26:42,277 --> 01:26:44,108
Whom will we bring to do all this?

788
01:26:45,447 --> 01:26:47,108
As it is, what is your problem?

789
01:26:47,649 --> 01:26:49,116
You wish that this music video...

790
01:26:49,184 --> 01:26:51,175
...should be just like
how you want it?

791
01:26:52,454 --> 01:26:56,288
That will be done when you
do it yourself. That's it.

792
01:27:29,484 --> 01:27:32,419
Dance and shake the world.

793
01:27:33,555 --> 01:27:37,753
Since so many years...
the whole world seems so still.

794
01:27:42,030 --> 01:27:46,091
Since so many years...
the whole world seems so still.

795
01:27:48,503 --> 01:27:52,439
There was thunder and lightning.
...from one thought so you...

796
01:27:56,511 --> 01:27:59,446
dance and shake the world.

797
01:28:00,849 --> 01:28:03,443
Dance and shake the world.

798
01:28:21,736 --> 01:28:23,397
Love... love...

799
01:28:23,471 --> 01:28:30,070
i have made you wear
the costume of love.

800
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:33,811
It is fire. It is water.

801
01:28:33,882 --> 01:28:40,412
Whoever feels like...
can make it bow.

802
01:28:42,824 --> 01:28:44,416
Lift it with ambition.

803
01:28:44,492 --> 01:28:46,756
Bow the highest of storms.

804
01:28:46,828 --> 01:28:48,955
Lift it with ambition.

805
01:28:49,030 --> 01:28:52,431
Bow the highest of storms. You...

806
01:28:55,503 --> 01:28:57,767
dance and shake the world.

807
01:29:20,462 --> 01:29:24,398
All the directions
will start speaking.

808
01:29:24,799 --> 01:29:27,393
There will be a new sun rising.

809
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:38,741
All the directions
will start speaking.

810
01:29:39,481 --> 01:29:41,813
There will be a new sun rising.

811
01:29:43,485 --> 01:29:45,419
There is a fire in these eyes.

812
01:29:45,487 --> 01:29:47,751
The one who touches them
will be set afire.

813
01:29:47,822 --> 01:29:49,414
There is a fire in these eyes.

814
01:29:49,491 --> 01:29:51,755
The one who touches them
will be set afire.

815
01:29:51,893 --> 01:29:53,952
There will be a word then.

816
01:29:54,029 --> 01:29:56,088
Melt the stone with the gaze.

817
01:29:56,498 --> 01:29:59,433
You... '

818
01:30:00,502 --> 01:30:02,436
dance and shake the world.

819
01:30:02,504 --> 01:30:04,438
Dance and shake the world.

820
01:30:04,839 --> 01:30:06,431
Show what your ambition is.

821
01:30:06,508 --> 01:30:08,772
Do something and show us.

822
01:30:08,843 --> 01:30:10,902
Which has been heard or seen.

823
01:30:10,979 --> 01:30:12,708
But it is different from
everything else.

824
01:30:12,781 --> 01:30:14,408
Just work your strength.

825
01:30:14,482 --> 01:30:16,712
Write a new history.

826
01:30:16,785 --> 01:30:19,379
Just work your strength.

827
01:30:19,454 --> 01:30:23,049
Write a new history. You.

828
01:30:25,460 --> 01:30:27,724
Dance and shake the world.

829
01:30:27,796 --> 01:30:29,388
Dance and shake the world.

830
01:30:29,464 --> 01:30:31,398
Dance and shake the world.

831
01:30:31,466 --> 01:30:33,730
Dance and shake the world.

832
01:30:33,802 --> 01:30:35,394
Raise the heads of ambition.

833
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:37,802
Dance and shake the world.

834
01:30:37,872 --> 01:30:39,396
Bow the highest of storms.

835
01:30:39,474 --> 01:30:42,409
Dance and shake the world.

836
01:30:42,477 --> 01:30:44,411
Melt the stone with your eyes.

837
01:30:44,479 --> 01:30:46,413
Dance and shake the world.

838
01:30:46,481 --> 01:30:48,415
Show what your ambition is.

839
01:30:48,483 --> 01:30:50,417
Dance and shake the world.

840
01:30:50,485 --> 01:30:52,419
Show what your ambition is.

841
01:30:52,487 --> 01:30:54,751
Dance and shake the world.

842
01:30:56,825 --> 01:31:00,955
There was a fog and storm
from this thought.

843
01:31:01,029 --> 01:31:04,089
You...

844
01:31:07,502 --> 01:31:09,697
Iove and shake the world.

845
01:31:11,439 --> 01:31:13,703
Love and shake the world.

846
01:31:30,458 --> 01:31:31,789
Umeed singh says...

847
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:35,057
if you are not mine, you
cannot be anyone's.

848
01:31:35,463 --> 01:31:38,728
He has tears in his eyes
and a gun in his hands.

849
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:41,394
Focus in from his point of view.

850
01:31:41,469 --> 01:31:44,063
Nisha is standing in front
of him. With moist eyes.

851
01:31:44,472 --> 01:31:46,406
There is no way out.

852
01:31:48,476 --> 01:31:50,410
Superb.

853
01:31:51,479 --> 01:31:55,074
Sir... sir... sir... how
did you like it.

854
01:31:59,487 --> 01:32:01,421
I am sorry. I wasn't
hearing it properly.

855
01:32:03,491 --> 01:32:05,425
I was seeing the video, sorry.

856
01:32:05,493 --> 01:32:07,427
People make anything nowadays.

857
01:32:08,029 --> 01:32:09,428
Making something different...

858
01:32:11,833 --> 01:32:15,030
but i have heard that this
song is a super hit.

859
01:32:15,436 --> 01:32:17,370
The shaan music company was ruined.

860
01:32:17,438 --> 01:32:19,372
This song has done such business...

861
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:21,840
...that their three year's
business is done.

862
01:32:23,444 --> 01:32:25,776
The music industry people
say anything.

863
01:32:26,447 --> 01:32:27,778
One song...

864
01:32:27,916 --> 01:32:31,374
if one song is hit... a
whole industry... no.

865
01:32:34,789 --> 01:32:37,383
Sir... will you please tell
me your scene once again?

866
01:32:37,458 --> 01:32:40,052
Okay. Umeed singh says...

867
01:32:40,461 --> 01:32:43,055
...if you cannot be mine,
you will be nobody's.

868
01:32:43,464 --> 01:32:46,058
His eyes are teary. And he
has a gun in his hands.

869
01:32:46,467 --> 01:32:48,731
A focus in with his point of view.

870
01:32:48,803 --> 01:32:51,067
Nisha is standing in his presence.
With moist eyes.

871
01:32:51,472 --> 01:32:54,407
There is no way out now. Music.

872
01:32:55,476 --> 01:32:57,808
A nice concept. A lot of hard work.

873
01:32:57,879 --> 01:33:00,404
And a lot of love for
music and dance.

874
01:33:00,481 --> 01:33:02,745
All this is seen in dance.

875
01:33:02,817 --> 01:33:04,876
This video has taken that leap...

876
01:33:04,953 --> 01:33:06,750
...of success that the
rest are all stunned.

877
01:33:06,821 --> 01:33:08,948
Many music videos have
achieved success...

878
01:33:09,023 --> 01:33:10,684
...but dance is something different.

879
01:33:10,758 --> 01:33:13,886
Choreographer reva
has become a star.

880
01:33:13,962 --> 01:33:17,363
Her fashion and style has taken
over the world overnight.

881
01:33:17,432 --> 01:33:19,696
Her dance 'naach naach ke duniya hila
de (dance and shake the world)'...

882
01:33:19,767 --> 01:33:22,099
...has actually made the world shake.

883
01:33:22,437 --> 01:33:26,373
We will see one scene.
Dance and shake the world.

884
01:33:28,443 --> 01:33:32,379
Since so many years...
the whole world seems so still.

885
01:33:43,791 --> 01:33:45,383
Hello?
- Hi, handsome.

886
01:33:45,727 --> 01:33:48,389
Hi, mamta. What are you doing?
- Nothing.

887
01:33:49,464 --> 01:33:51,728
Then, shall we do something? What?

888
01:33:52,467 --> 01:33:54,401
Anything. Like...

889
01:33:55,470 --> 01:33:56,801
we will go to dinner.

890
01:33:56,871 --> 01:33:59,066
Why? Is it something
special tonight? Hey.

891
01:33:59,474 --> 01:34:03,740
Super star abhinav... and the
super super star mamta...

892
01:34:04,812 --> 01:34:08,077
they are going for dinner. What
can be more special than this?

893
01:34:09,884 --> 01:34:13,342
Okay. People think that putting
four songs make a musical.

894
01:34:15,423 --> 01:34:16,549
But we haven't been able to make...

895
01:34:16,624 --> 01:34:18,353
...a musical in the true
sense of the word.

896
01:34:19,427 --> 01:34:21,361
And looking at our
video's response...

897
01:34:22,430 --> 01:34:25,888
...i think that the audience
is ready for such a musical.

898
01:34:27,435 --> 01:34:31,030
Ya. And a special actor is
needed for such a film.

899
01:34:33,441 --> 01:34:35,909
Behind the lecture, what
i want to say is...

900
01:34:36,778 --> 01:34:38,370
i want to make a musical.

901
01:34:40,448 --> 01:34:42,382
With you.

902
01:34:43,451 --> 01:34:45,385
Hey... diwakar...

903
01:34:46,454 --> 01:34:48,388
hi, abhi.

904
01:34:59,467 --> 01:35:01,401
I saw your video.

905
01:35:02,804 --> 01:35:04,396
What should i say?

906
01:35:09,877 --> 01:35:12,345
It was very nice.
- Thanks.

907
01:35:12,413 --> 01:35:15,678
Abhi... why don't you join us?

908
01:35:24,425 --> 01:35:26,359
We have a booking in an
italian restaurant.

909
01:35:26,761 --> 01:35:28,353
We should get going.

910
01:35:30,431 --> 01:35:32,365
Enjoy your meal.

911
01:35:38,773 --> 01:35:42,368
Really nice guy.
- Yes.

912
01:35:42,710 --> 01:35:45,838
Abhi... what does she think she is?

913
01:35:45,913 --> 01:35:49,041
A song has gone a hit
and she is flying.

914
01:35:56,991 --> 01:35:59,391
Mamta... i want to go. What?

915
01:36:00,461 --> 01:36:02,395
You are joking.

916
01:36:02,797 --> 01:36:04,389
And dinner?

917
01:36:06,467 --> 01:36:08,401
No. I am going.

918
01:36:09,404 --> 01:36:13,670
For god's sake, abhi. Abhi! Abhi!

919
01:37:06,994 --> 01:37:08,393
Reva...

920
01:37:08,796 --> 01:37:10,388
you are very special.

921
01:37:15,470 --> 01:37:17,404
If you weren't there... this...

922
01:37:17,472 --> 01:37:19,406
can't we stop these formalities?

923
01:37:22,810 --> 01:37:25,074
Okay. If you weren't there...

924
01:37:26,881 --> 01:37:29,076
come on. We will stop
praising each other.

925
01:37:30,017 --> 01:37:34,078
Seriously, reva. Thank you.

926
01:37:37,825 --> 01:37:39,417
For being reva.

927
01:37:40,895 --> 01:37:43,090
Good night.
- Good night.

928
01:37:59,514 --> 01:38:01,914
Hi. Hi.

929
01:38:05,052 --> 01:38:06,451
Can i come inside?

930
01:38:29,477 --> 01:38:31,411
Nice place.

931
01:38:32,813 --> 01:38:34,405
Want some coffee?

932
01:38:50,031 --> 01:38:52,761
Congrats. For what?

933
01:38:55,903 --> 01:38:58,098
The people have liked your video.

934
01:38:59,507 --> 01:39:01,441
And...

935
01:39:02,510 --> 01:39:04,774
you have done all this
in your own way.

936
01:39:04,845 --> 01:39:10,044
Like how you were saying.
Yes. Congrats.

937
01:39:13,454 --> 01:39:15,388
You have said it.

938
01:39:16,457 --> 01:39:18,391
I know... i...

939
01:39:19,860 --> 01:39:21,384
i wanted to say it once
again. That's all.

940
01:39:34,008 --> 01:39:35,407
Reva... i love you.

941
01:39:44,018 --> 01:39:46,077
I committed a mistake that day.

942
01:39:48,956 --> 01:39:53,086
Can't we just forget whatever
happened that day?

943
01:40:01,502 --> 01:40:03,902
Hello, diwakar. Hi, reva!

944
01:40:04,505 --> 01:40:06,439
That writer is coming
to the office...

945
01:40:06,507 --> 01:40:08,441
...at eleven in the morning,
to tell the story.

946
01:40:08,909 --> 01:40:10,376
Yes, okay. I will reach there.

947
01:40:10,444 --> 01:40:11,911
Is that okay? Sure.

948
01:40:11,979 --> 01:40:14,038
Okay. I will see you tomorrow.
- Bye.

949
01:40:27,461 --> 01:40:29,395
Reva... i...

950
01:40:38,739 --> 01:40:40,400
go, abhi.

951
01:40:43,477 --> 01:40:45,411
I think you should leave.

952
01:41:43,804 --> 01:41:45,396
Sir, phone.

953
01:41:53,481 --> 01:41:55,745
Hello? What do you think
you are, abhi?

954
01:41:56,817 --> 01:41:58,409
How could you do like this?

955
01:41:58,486 --> 01:42:00,886
Mamta, not right now. What do
you mean by not right now?

956
01:42:01,489 --> 01:42:05,755
If you act like this...
- what? - then... we...

957
01:42:06,494 --> 01:42:07,825
we?

958
01:42:08,829 --> 01:42:14,028
Mamta... we were working
on a film together.

959
01:42:15,436 --> 01:42:18,371
That film is over now.
There is no we.

960
01:42:20,441 --> 01:42:22,841
If we get a chance to work
together again, we'll see.

961
01:42:23,911 --> 01:42:25,378
Okay?

962
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:27,379
I hate you.

963
01:42:29,450 --> 01:42:31,384
I am sorry.

964
01:42:42,463 --> 01:42:44,397
As an answer, shekhar looks at her.

965
01:42:44,465 --> 01:42:46,399
But he doesn't say anything.

966
01:42:46,467 --> 01:42:49,868
Even shweta looks at him.
Just looks at him.

967
01:42:50,471 --> 01:42:53,872
And then she too walks away
not saying anything. Than end.

968
01:42:59,747 --> 01:43:01,408
It's fantastic.

969
01:43:04,485 --> 01:43:06,419
Who is doing the role of shekhar?

970
01:43:08,889 --> 01:43:12,017
I think that abhi will be
perfect for this role.

971
01:43:14,895 --> 01:43:16,362
Perfect choice.

972
01:43:24,705 --> 01:43:26,832
Do you think that i will
be able to do this role?

973
01:43:30,444 --> 01:43:32,378
What else can my coming here means?

974
01:43:45,459 --> 01:43:49,054
And... what about the rest
of your team? - Team?

975
01:43:52,466 --> 01:43:54,400
Yes.

976
01:43:55,803 --> 01:43:58,067
Your cameraman. Writer.

977
01:44:00,741 --> 01:44:02,402
Reva and the others.

978
01:44:03,744 --> 01:44:06,406
All of them think that you
are good for this role.

979
01:44:07,481 --> 01:44:09,415
And reva thinks that there isn't
anyone better for this role than you.

980
01:44:15,890 --> 01:44:17,357
Professional.

981
01:44:17,424 --> 01:44:19,358
There should be intoxication.

982
01:44:19,426 --> 01:44:21,360
There should be intoxication.

983
01:44:25,432 --> 01:44:28,697
There should be fun.
There should be fun.

984
01:44:28,769 --> 01:44:32,762
There should be breeze.
There should be breeze.

985
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:36,037
There should be smoke.
There should be smoke.

986
01:44:40,781 --> 01:44:43,375
This life is colourless.

987
01:44:51,926 --> 01:44:55,384
This life is colourless,
i want a companion.

988
01:44:55,462 --> 01:44:59,398
This life is so slow,
a speed is needed.

989
01:44:59,466 --> 01:45:03,732
I want to become crazy, live
and die in this love.

990
01:45:03,804 --> 01:45:07,399
I want to become crazy, live
and die in this love.

991
01:45:07,474 --> 01:45:12,002
I just want love and music.
Colourless.

992
01:45:18,819 --> 01:45:22,346
This life is colourless,
i want a companion.

993
01:45:22,690 --> 01:45:26,353
This life is so slow,
it needs a pace.

994
01:45:26,427 --> 01:45:30,363
I want to go crazy, live
and die in this love.

995
01:45:30,431 --> 01:45:34,367
I want to go crazy, the
desire of some heart.

996
01:45:34,435 --> 01:45:37,370
Everyone should stop and stare.
I just want a beloved like that.

997
01:45:37,905 --> 01:45:39,372
Colourless.

998
01:46:07,468 --> 01:46:09,663
Life... life is not life...

999
01:46:10,871 --> 01:46:13,999
the one that doesn't have love.

1000
01:46:18,412 --> 01:46:21,347
Life... life is not life...

1001
01:46:22,750 --> 01:46:25,014
the one that doesn't have love.

1002
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:29,355
'Let the heart love, let the
heartbeat come closer.

1003
01:46:29,423 --> 01:46:31,357
The one that doesn't have love.

1004
01:46:31,425 --> 01:46:33,757
'Let the heart love, let the
heartbeat come closer.

1005
01:46:33,827 --> 01:46:37,024
There is silence, i need
rhythm in this silence.

1006
01:46:37,431 --> 01:46:39,365
Colurless.

1007
01:46:41,435 --> 01:46:44,700
This life is colourless,
i want a companion.

1008
01:46:45,439 --> 01:46:48,704
This life is so slow,
a speed is needed.

1009
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:15,394
The breaths are going on but...

1010
01:47:16,470 --> 01:47:19,405
where am i living here?

1011
01:47:23,744 --> 01:47:26,406
The breaths are going on but...

1012
01:47:27,614 --> 01:47:30,412
where am i living here?

1013
01:47:31,485 --> 01:47:35,421
Let me have fun, let
the heart become hard.

1014
01:47:35,489 --> 01:47:39,425
Let me have fun, let
the heart become hard.

1015
01:47:39,493 --> 01:47:42,758
An actor is alone,
he wants an actor.

1016
01:47:42,830 --> 01:47:44,422
Colourless.

1017
01:47:46,834 --> 01:47:48,426
Colourless.

1018
01:47:50,504 --> 01:47:54,440
This life is colourless,
i want a companion.

1019
01:47:54,508 --> 01:47:57,773
This life is so slow,
a speed is needed.

1020
01:47:58,045 --> 01:48:02,038
I want to become crazy, the
ambition of some heart.

1021
01:48:02,116 --> 01:48:05,779
I want to become crazy, live
and die in this love.

1022
01:48:05,853 --> 01:48:09,118
Some love... some love...
some love is needed.

1023
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:27,406
'Colourless.

1024
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:35,414
You are very good.

1025
01:48:40,487 --> 01:48:42,421
And i was very bad.

1026
01:48:42,756 --> 01:48:45,418
That's not true. You were good too.

1027
01:48:49,830 --> 01:48:52,094
Reva, don't you think
that abhi worked well?

1028
01:48:52,766 --> 01:48:54,427
You were good, abhi.

1029
01:48:56,503 --> 01:48:58,437
In fact, you were very good.

1030
01:49:02,509 --> 01:49:04,443
And you too.

1031
01:49:05,846 --> 01:49:08,440
Mahesh must be waiting in
the office. We will go.

1032
01:49:13,453 --> 01:49:15,387
Bye. Abhi.

1033
01:49:40,013 --> 01:49:42,072
I haven't seen a talent
like reva before this.

1034
01:49:42,482 --> 01:49:47,749
And... as a director i feel
lucky that reva is with me.

1035
01:49:53,493 --> 01:49:55,427
Mr. Diwakar had faith me.

1036
01:49:56,830 --> 01:49:59,094
Is anything else needed to be said?

1037
01:50:11,778 --> 01:50:13,370
Diwakar. Abhi...

1038
01:50:13,981 --> 01:50:16,711
i was thinking about the goa song...

1039
01:50:16,783 --> 01:50:18,375
i was seeing you on television now.

1040
01:50:20,787 --> 01:50:23,915
You... were speaking about reva.

1041
01:50:23,991 --> 01:50:25,720
Oh, that!

1042
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:27,791
That is the truth, abhi.

1043
01:50:27,928 --> 01:50:30,396
An artiste like reva doesn't
come everyday in life.

1044
01:50:31,465 --> 01:50:33,399
I know that.

1045
01:50:34,468 --> 01:50:36,732
As i was saying... when we
will go for that song...

1046
01:50:36,803 --> 01:50:40,398
...there will be a lot of people
and a lot of things...

1047
01:50:40,474 --> 01:50:41,805
diwakar...

1048
01:50:41,875 --> 01:50:45,072
we will take later, i am busy. Okay?

1049
01:51:05,499 --> 01:51:07,763
Hi. Hey, bring the chair. No.

1050
01:51:10,904 --> 01:51:12,701
I'm sorry.
- Why?

1051
01:51:13,774 --> 01:51:16,038
Because, i was rude on
the phone yesterday.

1052
01:51:16,977 --> 01:51:19,377
That's okay. Perhaps, you were busy.

1053
01:51:22,916 --> 01:51:27,046
Yes, i was. Still, i shouldn't
have done that.

1054
01:51:35,462 --> 01:51:37,396
Hi.
- Hello.

1055
01:51:40,934 --> 01:51:43,061
Anyway, sorry to disturb.

1056
01:51:54,014 --> 01:51:57,074
Is there something between
both of... - nothing.

1057
01:51:57,484 --> 01:51:59,952
Sir, there is this rumour in the
market regarding your price.

1058
01:52:00,821 --> 01:52:02,413
So, what would you like
to say about it?

1059
01:52:03,824 --> 01:52:05,951
What shall i say?
It's just a rumour.

1060
01:52:06,026 --> 01:52:07,425
But, the rumour is same, sir.

1061
01:52:09,496 --> 01:52:11,691
You asked a question
and i replied to it.

1062
01:52:11,765 --> 01:52:13,357
Sir, look, we journalists
very well know...

1063
01:52:13,433 --> 01:52:16,698
...as to how much is the
reality behind a rumour.

1064
01:52:17,437 --> 01:52:20,702
Forget it. Who's the
heroine in this film?

1065
01:52:25,779 --> 01:52:28,043
Reva. Reva!?

1066
01:52:28,715 --> 01:52:30,376
Is she the same video album girl?

1067
01:52:31,451 --> 01:52:33,385
She dances quite good, sir.

1068
01:52:34,988 --> 01:52:38,048
But, sir, what do you feel? Will
she able to act the same way?

1069
01:52:39,459 --> 01:52:40,721
Why are you asking this to me?

1070
01:52:40,794 --> 01:52:42,386
Better ask the director
and the producer.

1071
01:52:42,462 --> 01:52:44,396
As they are the ones who
signed her, and not me.

1072
01:52:44,731 --> 01:52:46,392
You said it right, sir.

1073
01:52:47,734 --> 01:52:50,066
I'll find out about
reva from diwakar.

1074
01:52:51,805 --> 01:52:53,397
You know, sir...

1075
01:52:54,474 --> 01:52:56,408
reva's affair with diwakar...

1076
01:52:57,477 --> 01:52:59,411
in a way it's a rumour, sir.
- What?

1077
01:52:59,479 --> 01:53:01,743
You know... there's this
rumour in the market...

1078
01:53:03,483 --> 01:53:05,417
you might be aware of it, sir.

1079
01:53:05,485 --> 01:53:07,419
What are you doing? You're
hitting a journalist!

1080
01:53:07,487 --> 01:53:08,749
Do you know what it means?
- What did you say?

1081
01:53:08,822 --> 01:53:11,017
I'll sue you in the court. Abhi!
Abhi! I won't leave you! - Get out!

1082
01:53:11,425 --> 01:53:13,359
You're hitting, right?
- Get out!

1083
01:53:13,427 --> 01:53:14,689
Abhi, just stop it!

1084
01:53:14,761 --> 01:53:16,353
Abhi, is this the way to handle it?

1085
01:53:17,431 --> 01:53:19,365
You don't know anything!
So, don't intervene!

1086
01:53:27,441 --> 01:53:28,908
Abhi! I'll see you!

1087
01:53:28,975 --> 01:53:30,704
Just watch tomorrow's paper!

1088
01:53:30,777 --> 01:53:33,371
You freak out like a big star!
Just watch tomorrow's paper!

1089
01:54:27,434 --> 01:54:28,696
Where is mr. Diwakar?

1090
01:54:28,768 --> 01:54:30,360
He's inside. In the make-up van.

1091
01:54:30,437 --> 01:54:32,371
Along with miss reva.

1092
01:54:40,447 --> 01:54:42,381
Give this to him.

1093
01:54:42,449 --> 01:54:44,383
Okay, sir.

1094
01:55:05,472 --> 01:55:08,407
It's the heat of love!

1095
01:55:12,812 --> 01:55:17,010
Life gets heated up if it
feels the heat of love.

1096
01:55:20,420 --> 01:55:24,686
The colour of love is bright; so
the eyes turn bright as well.

1097
01:55:25,959 --> 01:55:29,690
The craze hits so as.
The heart clinks like an anklet.

1098
01:55:29,763 --> 01:55:32,357
And, the drive goes all haywire.

1099
01:55:33,767 --> 01:55:38,033
Life gets heated up if it
feels the heat of love.

1100
01:55:41,441 --> 01:55:45,707
The colour of love is bright; so
the eyes turn bright as well.

1101
01:55:46,913 --> 01:55:50,713
The craze hits so as.
The heart clinks like an anklet.

1102
01:55:50,784 --> 01:55:53,378
And, the drive goes all haywire.

1103
01:55:54,454 --> 01:55:56,388
It's the heat of love!

1104
01:55:58,458 --> 01:56:02,394
Life gets heated up if it
feels the heat of love.

1105
01:56:38,431 --> 01:56:41,366
Love! Love! Love!
Is all that we've got to do.

1106
01:56:42,435 --> 01:56:45,370
Love is fire.
And, we've to go through.

1107
01:56:49,776 --> 01:56:53,041
Love! Love! Love!
Is all that we've got to do.

1108
01:56:53,446 --> 01:56:56,381
There's no limit.
And, we've to go through.

1109
01:56:56,783 --> 01:56:59,377
Even if there are blues in life.

1110
01:57:00,453 --> 01:57:04,719
And, hence it turns all crusty.

1111
01:57:07,927 --> 01:57:09,724
It's the heat of love!

1112
01:57:09,796 --> 01:57:12,390
Life gets heated up if it
feels the heat of love.

1113
01:57:13,933 --> 01:57:17,391
The craze hits so as.
The heart clinks like an anklet.

1114
01:57:17,470 --> 01:57:19,734
And, the drive goes all haywire.

1115
01:57:24,944 --> 01:57:29,404
Life gets heated up if it
feels the heat of love.

1116
01:58:10,924 --> 01:58:13,722
The gaze writhes and gets
locked as it's affected.

1117
01:58:14,794 --> 01:58:17,388
And, there's no idea; when
or where might it get locked.

1118
01:58:22,469 --> 01:58:25,404
The gaze writhes and gets
locked as it's affected.

1119
01:58:26,005 --> 01:58:28,735
And, there's no idea; when
or where might it get locked.

1120
01:58:29,476 --> 01:58:31,410
Even if there are blues in life.

1121
01:58:33,012 --> 01:58:37,073
And, hence it turns all crusty.

1122
01:58:40,820 --> 01:58:42,412
It's the heat of love!

1123
01:58:42,489 --> 01:58:44,821
Life gets heated up if it
feels the heat of love.

1124
01:58:46,826 --> 01:58:49,954
The craze hits so as.
The heart clinks like an anklet.

1125
01:58:50,029 --> 01:58:52,088
And, the drive goes all haywire.

1126
01:58:57,837 --> 01:59:01,432
Life gets heated up if it
feels the heat of love.

1127
01:59:05,512 --> 01:59:08,845
The craze hits so as.
The heart clinks like an anklet.

1128
01:59:08,915 --> 01:59:11,042
And, the drive goes all haywire.

1129
01:59:16,456 --> 01:59:20,790
Life gets heated up if it
feels the heat of love.

1130
01:59:21,995 --> 01:59:26,659
Life gets heated up if it
feels the heat of love.

1131
01:59:30,804 --> 01:59:33,068
Mahesh, tell abhi that
the shot is ready.

1132
01:59:33,473 --> 01:59:35,407
Sir, he went away.

1133
01:59:35,475 --> 01:59:36,737
Went away? Where?

1134
01:59:36,810 --> 01:59:38,402
The production guys say that
he has gone to mumbai.

1135
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:42,414
Mumbai?

1136
01:59:59,032 --> 02:00:01,762
Sir... diwakar-ji has
come to meet you.

1137
02:00:18,785 --> 02:00:20,377
Hi, abhi.

1138
02:00:30,463 --> 02:00:32,397
How are you?

1139
02:00:38,805 --> 02:00:41,069
Abhi, i don't even know as to
what's happening between us.

1140
02:00:43,476 --> 02:00:44,807
If there's some misunderstanding,
then...

1141
02:00:44,878 --> 02:00:47,073
diwakar, i don't want
to do your film.

1142
02:00:53,486 --> 02:00:56,421
Don't ask me the reason.
I won't do the film.

1143
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:04,418
And, whatever your losses are...

1144
02:01:04,497 --> 02:01:06,431
...tell them to me,
and i'll reimburse.

1145
02:02:36,789 --> 02:02:39,053
How can you be this unprofessional,
abhi?

1146
02:02:47,734 --> 02:02:49,395
Abhi, i did tell you before.

1147
02:02:49,535 --> 02:02:52,402
That our profession is on one hand.
And, we're on the other.

1148
02:02:52,472 --> 02:02:54,406
So, don't mix them up.

1149
02:02:54,807 --> 02:02:59,801
And, i also told you, reva,
that i'm not great like you.

1150
02:02:59,879 --> 02:03:01,403
Abhi, don't ridicule me!

1151
02:03:01,481 --> 02:03:03,415
I'm not ridiculing.

1152
02:03:05,485 --> 02:03:07,749
Do you want to know, why i
don't want to do your film?

1153
02:03:09,956 --> 02:03:12,015
I love reva very much.

1154
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:16,357
Since, always.

1155
02:03:21,701 --> 02:03:23,362
She was everything to me.

1156
02:03:25,438 --> 02:03:27,372
And, one day i lost her.

1157
02:03:30,443 --> 02:03:34,379
In the beginning i used
to think; so what?

1158
02:03:36,783 --> 02:03:38,375
I can live without reva.

1159
02:03:40,453 --> 02:03:42,387
But, i was wrong.

1160
02:03:50,463 --> 02:03:52,397
You were right.

1161
02:03:57,470 --> 02:03:59,404
It was my fault and...

1162
02:03:59,472 --> 02:04:01,406
now, i've to bear for it.

1163
02:04:04,010 --> 02:04:06,069
I cannot live without you, reva.

1164
02:04:15,421 --> 02:04:17,355
But, i can understand this.

1165
02:04:24,430 --> 02:04:26,364
Diwakar is the right person for you.

1166
02:04:26,966 --> 02:04:29,628
He understands you. And,
he has supported you.

1167
02:04:31,971 --> 02:04:35,031
But, this understanding
means nothing to me.

1168
02:04:38,711 --> 02:04:41,373
Because, i don't find
a solution for myself.

1169
02:04:51,457 --> 02:04:52,719
The space that i've
for you in my heart...

1170
02:04:52,792 --> 02:04:54,384
...what should i do with that?

1171
02:04:58,464 --> 02:05:00,398
I can do nothing.

1172
02:05:05,872 --> 02:05:09,399
I'm getting insane day by day
as i see you both together.

1173
02:05:11,410 --> 02:05:13,344
I'm unable to bear it!

1174
02:05:17,416 --> 02:05:19,350
And, this has an effect
on my profession.

1175
02:05:19,418 --> 02:05:21,352
I'm unable to do anything right!

1176
02:05:22,421 --> 02:05:23,683
I know...

1177
02:05:23,756 --> 02:05:26,350
i know, reva, that this film
will ruin because of me!

1178
02:05:29,428 --> 02:05:31,692
So, before it is too late,
i've decided that...

1179
02:05:31,764 --> 02:05:33,356
...i'm opting out of this film.

1180
02:05:34,967 --> 02:05:37,697
Do you know, diwakar, that i...

1181
02:05:37,770 --> 02:05:41,035
...always told reva that i want
loads of money and fame.

1182
02:05:44,977 --> 02:05:47,036
I've earned everything
and i'm not happy.

1183
02:05:59,458 --> 02:06:01,392
And, that is because...

1184
02:06:03,462 --> 02:06:05,396
...my happiness lies in you, reva.

1185
02:06:08,467 --> 02:06:10,332
And, you're not near to me.

1186
02:06:20,413 --> 02:06:22,347
Now, i don't want anything.

1187
02:06:23,416 --> 02:06:26,749
Neither film nor money. Nothing.

1188
02:06:26,819 --> 02:06:28,343
I just want to go back.

1189
02:06:29,422 --> 02:06:31,356
I want to go back.

1190
02:06:43,769 --> 02:06:45,361
That's it.

1191
02:06:46,772 --> 02:06:48,364
And, i'm very sorry.

1192
02:06:57,850 --> 02:07:01,047
Abhi, when we met...

1193
02:07:04,924 --> 02:07:09,054
...you were able to
see me the way i'm.

1194
02:07:12,465 --> 02:07:14,399
And, this was the very reason
for your love with me.

1195
02:07:16,802 --> 02:07:19,066
And i love you because.

1196
02:07:21,741 --> 02:07:24,403
And, you were able to understand...

1197
02:07:24,477 --> 02:07:28,937
...everything about me, that
others were unable to.

1198
02:07:31,951 --> 02:07:33,418
But, that day...

1199
02:07:33,819 --> 02:07:36,413
...that day, in your car...

1200
02:07:40,493 --> 02:07:42,427
that day, it was your success
that was doing the talking.

1201
02:07:44,830 --> 02:07:48,823
And then the other day, when
you came home to wish...

1202
02:07:48,901 --> 02:07:52,098
...that day as well your success
did all the talking.

1203
02:07:54,774 --> 02:07:57,436
Whatever you said that day,
it was because...

1204
02:07:57,510 --> 02:08:01,776
...you were successful in
the eyes of the people.

1205
02:08:03,516 --> 02:08:05,450
But, today...

1206
02:08:09,455 --> 02:08:11,719
today, i can see the
same abhi, who...

1207
02:08:16,796 --> 02:08:19,060
...saw me in the bus that day.

1208
02:08:23,469 --> 02:08:25,403
Diwakar...

1209
02:08:25,471 --> 02:08:28,736
diwakar wants to work with
me because of my talent.

1210
02:08:29,475 --> 02:08:31,409
And, there's nothing between
us other than that.

1211
02:08:40,486 --> 02:08:42,420
In fact, i was just waiting
for you, abhi.

1212
02:08:45,024 --> 02:08:50,758
And, if you had gone away
without saying all this...

1213
02:08:50,830 --> 02:08:55,096
...then too, i would have
only waited for you.

1214
02:08:56,502 --> 02:08:58,436
Forever.

1215
02:09:05,845 --> 02:09:07,437
Do you want to say that...

1216
02:09:07,980 --> 02:09:10,039
...you still love me?

1217
02:09:12,451 --> 02:09:14,385
What else?

1218
02:09:29,468 --> 02:09:31,402
I'm... i'm sorry.

1219
02:09:33,472 --> 02:09:35,406
I misunderstood you.

1220
02:09:35,474 --> 02:09:37,408
Oh, i'm stupid!

1221
02:09:40,012 --> 02:09:42,071
You didn't misunderstand
me entirely.

1222
02:09:44,950 --> 02:09:48,408
It's true that i'm working
with her because of talent.

1223
02:09:50,756 --> 02:09:54,419
But, it's true as well
that i love you.

1224
02:09:56,762 --> 02:09:58,957
It's just that i was looking
for a chance to express...

1225
02:09:59,498 --> 02:10:01,432
and, now...

1226
02:10:03,502 --> 02:10:05,766
abhi, if i say that
i'm happy for you...

1227
02:10:06,505 --> 02:10:08,439
...then, i would be a liar.

1228
02:10:08,507 --> 02:10:09,701
Yes.

1229
02:10:09,842 --> 02:10:13,039
But, i'm very much happy for reva.

1230
02:10:13,779 --> 02:10:17,044
Because, reva should get
that all she longs for.

1231
02:10:21,053 --> 02:10:22,384
And, she longs for you.

1232
02:10:29,795 --> 02:10:31,387
