1
00:03:01,568 --> 00:03:06,733
Even after living for 35 years in
U.S., whenever l come to lndia...

2
00:03:07,674 --> 00:03:10,939
...l don't know why, but
l feel very excited.

3
00:03:12,111 --> 00:03:15,740
l feel as though l've come to the
warmth of my mother's lap. Today...

4
00:03:16,015 --> 00:03:20,452
...my lndia may have something
to offer, or not, but she has...

5
00:03:20,887 --> 00:03:24,050
...one thing in abundance, and
that is love. The air here...

6
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,316
...the buildings here,
echo with one word - Love.

7
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:32,120
One such building
is... The Taj Mahal.

8
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:39,002
My American friends... in U.S.,
Love means give and take.

9
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,074
But in lndia it means
give, give and give!

10
00:04:08,234 --> 00:04:11,067
And there comes another
unbelievable thing...

11
00:04:23,316 --> 00:04:26,774
- How is your family?
- My wife is very peeved with you.

12
00:04:27,287 --> 00:04:29,687
This time l'll make it up to her.

13
00:04:31,524 --> 00:04:35,824
U ou've become a big-wig now.
U ou last come to us 10 years ago!

14
00:04:36,262 --> 00:04:40,824
- My kids are dying to meet you.
- l'm packing off this lot.

15
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:46,666
l'll accompany you to Dehra Dun
and spend 3-4 days with your kids.

16
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,407
Put your window up, friend.
lt's getting dusty inside.

17
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,221
We've grown up in this dust...

18
00:05:04,924 --> 00:05:07,518
...so how can we stop
it from coming in?

19
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:12,395
The scent of this dust from
lndia is out of this world.

20
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,567
For 35 years you've been living in
the U.S., but you haven't changed.

21
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:24,173
U ou must be the first lndian to have
earned so much money and fame there.

22
00:05:28,448 --> 00:05:30,848
U ou're coming to my house
after exactly 10 years!

23
00:05:32,652 --> 00:05:38,056
We sold our house at Dehra Dun and
built a house amidst our land.

24
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:43,723
My brother lives in the city.
My mother, wife and l live here.

25
00:05:44,897 --> 00:05:47,331
Since it's vacation time,
it's full house at home.

26
00:05:48,134 --> 00:05:52,400
Kulvanti and her kids are here, too.
And they're all awaiting you...

27
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,233
...as though some film star
from Mumbai is expected!

28
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,777
See! We're cought right here.
This is Ganga, my daughter.

29
00:06:08,187 --> 00:06:10,018
The same. Our little Kusum.

30
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:23,765
- Look who's here, dear.
- Don't tell me. Let me guess...

31
00:06:24,137 --> 00:06:28,301
U ou're American-uncle, Dad's friend.
25 years ago... No!

32
00:06:28,608 --> 00:06:31,008
35 years ago, you went there
with Rs. 10,000 in hand.

33
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,837
Today you're rich!

34
00:06:33,112 --> 00:06:37,139
U ou've a huge family with
18 sons, 1 1 daughters...

35
00:06:37,383 --> 00:06:41,285
9 daughters-in-law, 3 sisters, 3
brothers, cars and helicopters too!

36
00:06:41,621 --> 00:06:44,146
And which is that city, Dad?
U ou live in Hollywood...

37
00:06:44,424 --> 00:06:48,087
...where all the American movie
stars live. And your bungalow is...

38
00:06:48,761 --> 00:06:51,252
Won't you touch his feet
and pay your respects?

39
00:06:52,532 --> 00:07:01,031
- Bless you. - My son...
- l'll go tell Mom.

40
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:04,669
- Tell her what? They're all
activated as it is. - What happened?

41
00:07:04,911 --> 00:07:07,709
Come along at least.
A royal welcome awaits you.

42
00:07:09,382 --> 00:07:14,115
- Madam...
- What is it, damn you!

43
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,454
Master is here with
his American friend.

44
00:07:18,658 --> 00:07:23,322
- What do you mean? He's here?!
- What! He has come? Today?

45
00:07:24,097 --> 00:07:27,965
Somebody get my ''chunni''
Get aside, will you?

46
00:07:29,268 --> 00:07:31,236
- Did you have to sit here only?
- Come, friend... - Wow!

47
00:07:32,405 --> 00:07:37,138
- What a lovely farm-house!
- My ''chunni'', kids! Hurry!

48
00:07:38,678 --> 00:07:41,875
- ls that American here?
- He's here, sis. - How are you?

49
00:07:49,455 --> 00:07:53,050
This is height of shamelessness.
l'm going...

50
00:07:56,929 --> 00:07:58,920
- Namaste...
- Namaste...

51
00:08:00,266 --> 00:08:06,000
- Honestly! U ou didn't tell me...
- So what? l'm no stranger.

52
00:08:06,773 --> 00:08:08,570
- True, but...
- Good you came.

53
00:08:11,544 --> 00:08:14,411
We were expecting you tomorrow.

54
00:08:14,747 --> 00:08:17,682
Anyway, now that
you're here, welcome.

55
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:25,355
- l hear you're a big-wig now.
- For you, l'm the same little boy.

56
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:28,923
l need your blessings, in fact.
So...

57
00:08:29,428 --> 00:08:34,491
- But how can l bless you, son?
- Why not? - Cow-dung!

58
00:08:47,713 --> 00:08:49,738
They are Nitin, Sonali,
Daksha, Dabboo...

59
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:07,097
That N.R.l. is being fussed over
as though he's God!

60
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,794
That Surajdev has an complex
about foreign countries!

61
00:09:11,571 --> 00:09:14,472
- l know him for 10 years!
- U ou are an N.R.l. too.

62
00:09:15,441 --> 00:09:20,538
- Why don't they fuss over you?
- They will, my dear. They will.

63
00:09:20,847 --> 00:09:23,281
- U ou'll see.
- When, Dad? When?

64
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:27,283
When he'll come with a proposal
for his daughter Ganga.

65
00:09:27,887 --> 00:09:32,620
When will he do that?
U ears have gone by...

66
00:09:34,193 --> 00:09:38,323
- Then fix it once and for all.
- Fix it? Without deciding dowry?

67
00:09:39,165 --> 00:09:43,795
U ou've pretty silly. l've educated
this boy; made him a body-builder.

68
00:09:44,103 --> 00:09:47,300
- What for?
- Then go and meet them.

69
00:09:48,274 --> 00:09:51,835
A variety of gourmet dishes have
been made for this richie-rich!

70
00:09:57,149 --> 00:10:01,779
Wow! What a delicious dinner. l used
to return from Delhi and Mumbai.

71
00:10:02,622 --> 00:10:06,217
But the fruits and vegetables
of rural lndia are unique.

72
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:10,421
And why not? When they're from
the fields of the Sun God!

73
00:10:12,465 --> 00:10:17,095
This is Amirchand. My mother's
sister-in-law's, sister's son!

74
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,002
Why don't you say
a distant-cousin?

75
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:25,577
Sir, l'm Amirchand, my brother
Garibchand, and my wife Bhagyashri.

76
00:10:31,017 --> 00:10:35,920
- He's an N.R.l. too.
- Which country do you come from?

77
00:10:36,222 --> 00:10:41,091
- Not now. He used to live
in Sri Lanka. - So what?

78
00:10:41,827 --> 00:10:46,093
An lndian coming from Sri-Lanka is
an NRl, too! - We're small people.

79
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:50,525
Variety of rich dishes are laid out
for you. - We're not even invited!

80
00:10:51,304 --> 00:10:55,764
Amirchand, come here and
open your complaints book.

81
00:10:56,676 --> 00:10:59,304
- My respects, Auntie.
- Right. How are you?

82
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,909
Uncle. Take your medicine
for the evening.

83
00:11:04,817 --> 00:11:10,312
- My dose? - U ou're to take your
dose everyday at 7 p.m. and 9 a.m.

84
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,653
- 9 a.m., 7 p.m...
- Who told you?

85
00:11:14,727 --> 00:11:19,096
- Tell me. Who told you.
- l was ironing your overcoat...

86
00:11:19,398 --> 00:11:23,630
...a slip fell out from it.
lt said what you are to eat...

87
00:11:24,403 --> 00:11:27,566
And also what not too.
lt was signed ''Arjun''.

88
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:33,742
- This is his work, eh?
- Who's this Arjun?

89
00:11:34,413 --> 00:11:40,079
He's my 18th son.
Son of my distant sister.

90
00:11:40,686 --> 00:11:44,554
He sees to my every personal need.
l call him my ''Little Master''.

91
00:11:45,324 --> 00:11:47,315
He has penned a lovely song.

92
00:11:49,762 --> 00:11:52,128
Have your dose first then go
on about ''l love lndia''.

93
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:56,658
Auntie, why is our Ganga...

94
00:11:57,103 --> 00:11:59,697
...buttering that man so much?

95
00:12:00,806 --> 00:12:06,711
U ou always smell of jealousy!
Here, have some water.

96
00:12:09,515 --> 00:12:12,382
This uncle can take us to U.S.A.

97
00:12:12,852 --> 00:12:16,982
- How?
- lf we impress him, that is.

98
00:12:17,456 --> 00:12:21,688
- But how?
- U ou ass... - Ass?

99
00:12:22,028 --> 00:12:25,293
-...with our music.
- That too English music.

100
00:12:25,598 --> 00:12:31,195
ldiot! He's an out and
out lndian American.

101
00:12:31,904 --> 00:12:34,429
lf you try to impress
him, it'll backfire!

102
00:12:35,408 --> 00:12:38,309
- Shall we bet on it?
- Done! - One moment.

103
00:12:39,545 --> 00:12:43,504
Do you remember our
song's English notes?

104
00:20:48,967 --> 00:20:50,195
U ou can't be serious!

105
00:20:52,204 --> 00:20:56,698
l am very much serious.
For my son Rajiv...

106
00:20:57,776 --> 00:20:59,573
...l'm asking your daughter's
hand in marriage.

107
00:21:02,447 --> 00:21:06,679
Look. Rajiv's mother
died 3 years back.

108
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,246
U ou know Rajiv is my only son.

109
00:21:12,891 --> 00:21:18,955
He was born and brought up there.
He hasn't seen lndia as yet.

110
00:21:20,465 --> 00:21:23,025
But he definitely knows the hearts...

111
00:21:23,335 --> 00:21:28,329
...and the thoughts of his lndian
parents, and he respects them.

112
00:21:31,677 --> 00:21:34,202
l'm asking your daughter's hand
because...

113
00:21:35,213 --> 00:21:39,411
...we N.R.l.s need girls
like her very badly.

114
00:21:41,486 --> 00:21:47,152
Because we've pushed our kids so
deeply in English books and manners

115
00:21:47,526 --> 00:21:53,021
That somewhere or the other,
even after seeing so much success...

116
00:21:53,565 --> 00:21:56,363
...we feel as though we're failures.

117
00:21:59,171 --> 00:22:00,968
And seeing all this...

118
00:22:02,174 --> 00:22:05,632
...today, girls like Ganga
are our only source of hope.

119
00:22:06,478 --> 00:22:12,280
That's why l've decided that by
making her my son's wife...

120
00:22:13,352 --> 00:22:16,685
...l'll take her from this
house, to that house.

121
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:22,089
But by asking you
with folded hands.

122
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:27,921
What nonsense! The fact that she
will go into such a loving family...

123
00:22:28,433 --> 00:22:32,460
...is so comforting.
There's just one hitch...

124
00:22:32,804 --> 00:22:37,901
- We're village folks...
- Don't make such cheap remarks.

125
00:22:38,877 --> 00:22:43,405
U ou know me well, don't you?
Leave the rest for later.

126
00:22:44,483 --> 00:22:46,542
l'll phone you from America.

127
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:51,016
No! A girl whom l don't send
to Delhi or Mumbai...

128
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:55,827
-...l'll allow to go to America?
Never! - Try to understand.

129
00:22:56,662 --> 00:22:58,323
Vices depend on one's upbringing

130
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:01,021
Not the nation.
And America's not far.

131
00:23:01,566 --> 00:23:05,434
How times have changed!
U ou'll send her to America?

132
00:23:05,971 --> 00:23:08,701
Make her a foreigner?

133
00:23:08,907 --> 00:23:09,931
Oh come on, mother...

134
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:13,541
Today the whole nation
is westernized.

135
00:23:13,879 --> 00:23:16,712
And Ganga has
graduated in English.

136
00:23:17,282 --> 00:23:21,343
Look at our own kids.
All twenty-four hours...

137
00:23:21,653 --> 00:23:26,352
...they watch musical channels
which show Michael Jackson!

138
00:23:28,694 --> 00:23:31,686
Don't be adamant about it.
l've given my word to my friend.

139
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,997
We had given our word to that
Amirchand too, for his son.

140
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,066
No... we hadn't given
any word to Amirchand.

141
00:23:40,005 --> 00:23:45,307
We had said we'd think about it.
And that son of his...

142
00:23:45,477 --> 00:23:48,037
- ...he drinks heavily.
- Then go and talk to him.

143
00:23:48,647 --> 00:23:52,083
- They are under that impression.
- So let them be!

144
00:23:52,684 --> 00:23:55,881
My Ganga will marry my friend's son.
And that's my final decision!

145
00:23:56,154 --> 00:24:00,557
- How can you decide by yourself?
- U ou should've thought about it.

146
00:24:00,892 --> 00:24:03,452
U ou should've taken some advice.

147
00:24:12,304 --> 00:24:17,799
Enough! Ganga will marry my
friend's son, and that's that!

148
00:24:26,218 --> 00:24:30,552
American uncle has gone,
but he left some snaps...

149
00:24:30,822 --> 00:24:34,053
- ...of his family and son Rajiv.
- Really? Show us... - No!

150
00:24:36,094 --> 00:24:40,087
But your father doesn't know
which is Rajiv's photograph.

151
00:24:40,365 --> 00:24:43,664
- What! - U es, because he forgot
to ask and uncle forgot to tell!

152
00:24:49,775 --> 00:24:52,869
- Show me then. l'll tell you.
- Hands off!

153
00:24:53,912 --> 00:24:56,779
l'll show you...
First of all the family.

154
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:01,051
This is American uncle
with his brother.

155
00:25:01,853 --> 00:25:05,482
- This is his sister-in-law.
- Looks strict!

156
00:25:06,858 --> 00:25:09,349
- This is Padma, his sister.
- She's fashionable.

157
00:25:10,562 --> 00:25:13,793
- And this is his mother, Krishna.
- A wholesome mother.

158
00:25:14,499 --> 00:25:17,991
Now the confusion sets in.
There are 2 heroes!

159
00:25:18,537 --> 00:25:22,871
- And you've to guess which one
is Ganga's! - Show me at least.

160
00:25:23,275 --> 00:25:27,507
l'll show you. Now the first hero.

161
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,281
Now, the second one.

162
00:25:46,131 --> 00:25:49,692
Now you have to guess
which of the two here...

163
00:25:50,502 --> 00:25:53,767
- ...is her hero!
- U es. Go ahead and guess.

164
00:25:54,439 --> 00:25:57,840
- Take your time, sis.
- Shall l tell you?

165
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:01,807
- l say it's this one!
- And l say...

166
00:26:02,214 --> 00:26:06,241
- ...sister's hero is this one!
- Sis...

167
00:26:06,551 --> 00:26:08,951
...you guess which
of the two is Rajiv.

168
00:26:12,457 --> 00:26:14,482
- Shall l show you?
- U es, go on.

169
00:26:16,228 --> 00:26:17,456
U es, show us...

170
00:26:45,724 --> 00:26:49,023
- My respects. - Be happy.
- Did you call me?

171
00:26:49,628 --> 00:26:52,927
U es l did. ls it true...

172
00:26:53,598 --> 00:26:57,398
...that you've asked your friend's
daughter's hand in marriage? - U es.

173
00:26:58,303 --> 00:27:00,396
And l've also given him my word.

174
00:27:01,873 --> 00:27:05,673
Good. But Kishorilal...

175
00:27:06,945 --> 00:27:11,609
...do you know this too, that
you're trying to bring...

176
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:15,442
...lndia's pure Ganges to these
concrete jungles of America?

177
00:27:15,787 --> 00:27:19,416
l know it. But how about
our future generation?

178
00:27:19,925 --> 00:27:23,452
Our lndian culture?
Who will preserve it for us?

179
00:27:24,329 --> 00:27:33,362
- Rajiv will never agree to it.
- He'll never.

180
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:42,441
Our sons don't like to visit lndia,
how will they choose an lndian girl?

181
00:27:43,348 --> 00:27:46,215
They are westernized, and for
them to marry lndian girls?

182
00:27:46,518 --> 00:27:49,578
- lmpossible!
- l'll make the impossible possible.

183
00:27:51,089 --> 00:27:54,957
And my Arjun. My Little Master.

184
00:28:44,576 --> 00:28:47,545
Arjun Sagar, is one of U.S.A.'s,
Canada's and U.K.'s...

185
00:28:47,846 --> 00:28:52,215
...upcoming artists whose
song, ''l Love My lndia''...

186
00:28:52,784 --> 00:28:58,017
...is topping the Asian Music Chart.
Let's now meet him.

187
00:28:58,823 --> 00:29:01,121
How did you come from
lndia to the U.S.A.?

188
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:05,996
By Air-lndia! Actually, l...

189
00:29:06,431 --> 00:29:10,367
l was born in a town called Mathura.

190
00:29:10,769 --> 00:29:13,863
- The town of Lord Krishna?
- U es, that's right.

191
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:20,939
But l'm not Krishna, l'm Arjun.
That too, from these modern times.

192
00:29:22,447 --> 00:29:26,781
Actually, l was 10 years old
when my parents died.

193
00:29:28,186 --> 00:29:31,314
My father was a musician,
and my mother, a school teacher.

194
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:36,784
l was just living a life
of an orphan, when Kishorilal...

195
00:29:37,095 --> 00:29:40,531
...who was like a brother to
my mother, came into my life.

196
00:29:40,965 --> 00:29:44,492
- Then?
- Then l came to America, and...

197
00:29:45,637 --> 00:29:48,231
...l worked in
a garage for 3 years.

198
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,073
Plied a taxi for 4 years.

199
00:29:53,645 --> 00:29:56,705
And then Kishorilal made me
a manager in his own garage.

200
00:29:58,616 --> 00:30:01,278
Today he's my father...

201
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,189
...deity, God... everything!

202
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:11,258
When he came to know that
l love singing and dancing...

203
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:15,830
...he built a work-studio for me.
Where we do our work...

204
00:30:16,534 --> 00:30:17,660
...and our rehearsals too.

205
00:30:45,663 --> 00:30:49,622
- Any regrets? - No.
- Any siblings? - No.

206
00:30:50,168 --> 00:30:54,400
- Any relations? - No.
- A Beloved? - Only in songs.

207
00:30:54,772 --> 00:30:59,300
- Ever loved anyone? - Never!
- Why is that?

208
00:31:01,146 --> 00:31:05,583
- Never found one.
- Who's your dream-girl?

209
00:31:10,522 --> 00:31:14,481
An lndian girl...
l don't really know.

210
00:31:15,093 --> 00:31:20,554
Because she's in my mind...
ln paintings. l haven't met her.

211
00:31:21,099 --> 00:31:25,058
- How long have you been
away from lndia? - 5 years.

212
00:31:31,009 --> 00:31:34,410
- U our future plans?
- lt's only to...

213
00:31:34,812 --> 00:31:39,408
...raise my father's house in
Mathura and build a music school.

214
00:31:40,218 --> 00:31:41,810
Where poor kids can come, and...

215
00:31:46,191 --> 00:31:50,594
- U es Rajiv? - Where are you?
Daddy wants you. Go home now.

216
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:56,859
- Has he called me now? - He has
chosen an lndian girl for me!

217
00:31:57,569 --> 00:32:00,834
- That's why he wants you.
- Has he called me alone?

218
00:32:06,277 --> 00:32:11,146
- Don't worry. l'll meet him.
- Else, he'll parcel me to lndia!

219
00:32:13,251 --> 00:32:15,981
Just one last question.

220
00:32:17,322 --> 00:32:19,984
- Sorry, but l've to go.
- lt's an important question.

221
00:32:20,491 --> 00:32:25,121
Look, didn't l just tell you that
nobody is an important as Kishorilal?

222
00:32:26,464 --> 00:32:27,328
Not even me!

223
00:32:35,974 --> 00:32:40,172
Arjun, Rajiv has
never gone to lndia...

224
00:32:40,712 --> 00:32:44,910
...and nor does he want to!
But l want him to go there.

225
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,211
To breathe the fragrance there...

226
00:32:50,288 --> 00:32:55,055
To understand the values there.
And choose the Ganga there.

227
00:32:57,829 --> 00:33:01,230
To agree to marry her
with all his heart.

228
00:33:02,567 --> 00:33:06,731
Just think that this is
my life's most important...

229
00:33:07,405 --> 00:33:09,635
...and beautiful dream.

230
00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:17,612
Which only you can fulfill for
Rajiv is your friend, and...

231
00:33:17,849 --> 00:33:21,444
No, Daddy. Don't you worry.
l promise you.

232
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,848
Rajiv will agree to marry Ganga!

233
00:33:39,937 --> 00:33:41,564
Give Monica 5 days leave.

234
00:33:43,975 --> 00:33:45,408
Take that as an order from me.

235
00:33:55,186 --> 00:33:58,485
- Who sent these flowers?
- That friend of yours...

236
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:03,151
- l sent them, sir.
- Welcome, welcome.

237
00:34:03,961 --> 00:34:07,453
- How do you like them?
- They're beautiful, and...

238
00:34:07,932 --> 00:34:12,426
l also know why you've sent them.
Advocating for Daddy, are you?

239
00:34:14,172 --> 00:34:18,108
l know l've to go to lndia
with you. Look around...

240
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:22,175
- Approve the girl and...
- U ou know everything...

241
00:34:22,714 --> 00:34:27,515
Daddy did one good thing.
He gave me the right to choose.

242
00:34:28,319 --> 00:34:34,280
- Meaning?
- He left the choice to me!

243
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:40,263
Come and see lndia once at least.
U ou'll like it very much.

244
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:51,702
l knew you'd join us too.
So, l booked 3 tickets to Delhi.

245
00:34:52,143 --> 00:34:54,475
- By Air-lndia!
- Why Air-lndia?

246
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:10,116
Sis! Sis! We got the information.

247
00:35:11,095 --> 00:35:16,260
- Sis! - What is it?
- We got the news! - What news?

248
00:35:16,801 --> 00:35:20,828
- Who's to be your husband.
- Who? - U ou won and he lost.

249
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:29,139
U es, l did lose. Here's your
prince Rajiv's photo...

250
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:34,776
- What is it?
- Get up! U our prince is here.

251
00:41:35,179 --> 00:41:41,118
- What! - U es. Come and see.
- No. l don't want to.

252
00:41:41,385 --> 00:41:45,082
Come on... see for yourself.
Ram hasn't come, but Krishna has!

253
00:41:45,756 --> 00:41:49,283
- What are you talking about?
- Rajiv is still in Delhi.

254
00:41:49,693 --> 00:41:52,218
- He has sent some Arjun
to see to things. - What?

255
00:41:59,003 --> 00:42:01,631
Look, uncle... Try to understand
what l'm saying.

256
00:42:02,173 --> 00:42:07,475
Rajiv is totally American. He will
not stand this heat and dust.

257
00:42:07,978 --> 00:42:11,277
And the stink! lf something
stinks... l mean, he'll go mad!

258
00:42:11,882 --> 00:42:16,615
Do you know what'll happen if
he comes here? He'll faint!

259
00:42:17,822 --> 00:42:21,417
He'll faint first, then come
to his senses and just fly off!

260
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:27,053
No. We're with you. Last night
Kishorilal told me everything.

261
00:42:27,631 --> 00:42:31,067
So now do as l tell you.

262
00:42:31,569 --> 00:42:36,029
- First remove these cows from here.
- The buffaloes, son.

263
00:42:37,141 --> 00:42:41,271
Whatever. Then send these
goats away some place.

264
00:42:42,613 --> 00:42:46,947
- Now this... does he bite?
- No. Just barks.

265
00:42:48,285 --> 00:42:51,118
U ou'll have to shift him because
Rajiv is allergic to dogs.

266
00:42:51,589 --> 00:42:54,956
- ls this cot for the dog?
- That cot...

267
00:42:55,593 --> 00:42:59,962
- lt's our servant's cot.
- No no. He can't sleep here.

268
00:43:00,364 --> 00:43:04,994
Build a servant quarter for him.
Everything must've its own set up.

269
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:10,102
Uncle, you do follow me, don't you?
We must clean up this place fast!

270
00:43:10,374 --> 00:43:12,342
- This straw here...
- lt's cow-dung, son.

271
00:43:14,211 --> 00:43:17,806
Ramu... that's your name, right?
Just throw this out at once.

272
00:43:18,449 --> 00:43:23,785
- Son, Kishorilal...
- Not him; talk about the son.

273
00:43:24,221 --> 00:43:27,281
He won't stand all this, so,
it's vital that we clean up.

274
00:43:34,732 --> 00:43:39,431
- Pompous, isn't he?
- Tells us to oust our dog!

275
00:43:40,304 --> 00:43:42,465
- Asks Ramu to sleep out.
- ls he a human or a beast?

276
00:43:43,407 --> 00:43:47,605
l'll turn this beast
into a man pretty soon.

277
00:43:48,178 --> 00:43:51,113
- How?
- l've a remedy for it.

278
00:43:52,349 --> 00:43:54,749
What will you do? What idea?

279
00:43:57,321 --> 00:44:01,451
Says our Ganga...

280
00:44:03,861 --> 00:44:07,353
- U ou are? - Daksha, a cousin.
- Good. Sit down please.

281
00:44:09,133 --> 00:44:11,624
- And you?
- Shake hands at least...

282
00:44:13,771 --> 00:44:18,174
- l'm the brother... only one.
- Please stand here.

283
00:44:18,876 --> 00:44:22,642
- Where's Ganga? Didn't see her.
- Come in, Sis...

284
00:44:31,221 --> 00:44:33,849
Don't remove your glasses.
l'm really Ganga.

285
00:44:38,595 --> 00:44:43,555
So then... that is... you are
chosen by Daddy for Rajiv?

286
00:44:43,968 --> 00:44:47,665
U es, when uncle saw me,
he said he won't find such...

287
00:44:47,871 --> 00:44:52,308
- ...lovely Ganga in the whole of
lndia! lsn't that so? - Sure.

288
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:57,340
Daddy was right! We won't
find a girl like you...

289
00:44:57,614 --> 00:44:59,878
...in this whole world,
let alone lndia.

290
00:45:04,955 --> 00:45:07,753
ls there a... te... telephone here?

291
00:45:08,492 --> 00:45:10,960
Will you let me talk to Rajiv?

292
00:45:11,962 --> 00:45:16,092
l'll certainly not do that.
l'll just talk to Daddy.

293
00:45:18,802 --> 00:45:21,566
Come along... Not you.
U ou sit right here.

294
00:45:27,878 --> 00:45:30,904
Book a call please. U es...
`Lightning' call will do.

295
00:45:31,782 --> 00:45:35,616
U es, l know it cost's 8 times more.
Charge 16 times more, even 32...

296
00:45:35,886 --> 00:45:37,877
...but l must get the call through.

297
00:45:38,922 --> 00:45:41,152
Let the lines be down or not...

298
00:45:48,432 --> 00:45:51,265
Even if they are down
try and put this call...

299
00:45:52,069 --> 00:45:54,936
What the hell are you doing?
No, l don't mean you...

300
00:45:55,506 --> 00:46:00,205
- Go sit there, please.
- Let me talk to Rajiv...

301
00:46:00,444 --> 00:46:05,211
l can't do that. Go and sit now.
Sit her there and see that she does!

302
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:09,808
Stay here... No Madam, l'm back.

303
00:46:10,854 --> 00:46:12,549
Look Madam, have pity on me.

304
00:46:13,424 --> 00:46:17,520
l had told you, you won't get
a line for 4 hours.

305
00:46:22,266 --> 00:46:24,962
- ls there any secluded place here?
- U es. - l want to be left alone.

306
00:46:26,003 --> 00:46:29,962
- And the moment the call
comes through, call me. - Fine.

307
00:46:38,082 --> 00:46:39,014
There's a problem...

308
00:46:47,991 --> 00:46:50,653
U es, put me through. Kishorilal?

309
00:46:51,161 --> 00:46:54,062
How are you?
No, l didn't phone you.

310
00:46:54,932 --> 00:46:58,959
Arjun is here and Rajiv is coming
tomorrow. We're all fine.

311
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:03,267
l'll just call her.
Ganga, my dear...

312
00:47:03,707 --> 00:47:08,269
- U es, Papa? - U our phone.
- Who's calling?

313
00:47:08,645 --> 00:47:12,604
- lt's an important call. - From?
- Guess. - Tell me, Papa.

314
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:17,177
- Kishorilal uncle.
- Really? Let me talk to him.

315
00:47:17,721 --> 00:47:23,523
Uncle? This is Ganga here.
My respects...

316
00:47:24,495 --> 00:47:28,090
l'm fine. Oh uncle! How
will l not remember you?

317
00:47:28,565 --> 00:47:33,127
And that song of yours...
We all sing it.

318
00:47:34,037 --> 00:47:36,198
lt's a super hit.
Even Grandma sings it!

319
00:47:38,008 --> 00:47:42,172
U es? And how are you? Do you
take your medicine on time?

320
00:47:44,581 --> 00:47:47,482
U our Little Master
is here. He's okay.

321
00:47:48,185 --> 00:47:52,679
A bit pompous... No, uncle.
He's nice.

322
00:47:54,258 --> 00:47:56,783
- Okay, l'll give it to him.
- U es, go on...

323
00:47:57,761 --> 00:47:58,989
Everything's fine.

324
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:06,563
- That soap in your room...
- Keep it as l told you to.

325
00:48:06,937 --> 00:48:09,838
- This is...
- Ganga.

326
00:48:11,708 --> 00:48:15,872
- And that one then... - A trick.
- U ou may go.

327
00:48:22,986 --> 00:48:24,317
Daddy, you were right.

328
00:48:55,786 --> 00:48:59,187
- l'm... My name is...
- l know. U ou're Arjun.

329
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:02,782
Rajiv's friend. U ou have come
to see me and my home.

330
00:49:03,994 --> 00:49:07,555
l'm sorry.
My entry was a bit mistimed.

331
00:49:08,632 --> 00:49:16,403
All good people admit their
error, and apologize at once.

332
00:49:18,075 --> 00:49:20,635
l'll say that all the good
people in this world...

333
00:49:21,111 --> 00:49:23,705
...forgive those, who apologize.

334
00:49:25,649 --> 00:49:28,015
U our face shows that
you've forgiven me.

335
00:49:29,419 --> 00:49:34,015
And your smile says that we
must become friends soon.

336
00:49:35,659 --> 00:49:39,117
And your hand says we must
shake hands soon. Right?

337
00:49:40,397 --> 00:49:44,333
- A firm friendship? - U es.
- Absolutely? - Sure.

338
00:50:03,353 --> 00:50:06,413
Every relation in this house
is bound with bond of love.

339
00:50:07,257 --> 00:50:11,250
Whether it's with an animal, or
between a servant and his master.

340
00:50:13,096 --> 00:50:16,691
To form new relationships
we don't break old ones!

341
00:50:32,516 --> 00:50:35,246
Do you have any shame, or not?

342
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:42,015
Forgot the rules set here? lt seems
he's not fixing your betrothal...

343
00:50:42,259 --> 00:50:45,751
- ...but you're confirming his!
- My dear...

344
00:50:46,663 --> 00:50:49,530
Whatever Arjun's doing is
for your own good.

345
00:50:50,934 --> 00:50:54,131
lmagine that he's a film director.

346
00:50:54,905 --> 00:50:57,567
Who is planning to get the hero
and the heroine together.

347
00:50:58,342 --> 00:51:04,372
Rajiv is coming tomorrow.
ln his honor, l've invited...

348
00:51:04,648 --> 00:51:07,742
...the elite of the city.
So don't do any mischief tomorrow.

349
00:51:08,085 --> 00:51:13,318
Am l not here to break the
legs that you're standing on!

350
00:51:13,724 --> 00:51:18,320
How will you? And why?
As if you were never little.

351
00:51:19,162 --> 00:51:23,496
U ou too must've been naughty then.
Don't laugh! U ou'll grow old too.

352
00:51:24,601 --> 00:51:27,195
Now everything is fine between
us. We know each other...

353
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:33,834
l just wish to explain one thing.
Think anything you like about me.

354
00:51:34,244 --> 00:51:37,509
Rajiv's servant, his ''cutlery''...

355
00:51:37,948 --> 00:51:40,815
His friend, brother, anything!
But there's one thing.

356
00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:46,084
A boy like Rajiv is hard to find
in this whole world, let alone U.S.

357
00:51:47,257 --> 00:51:50,488
He's out of this world.
...he's mind blowing!

358
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:58,124
Today too, he'll come in a
special car in such great style...

359
00:51:59,569 --> 00:52:04,097
- ...our American Prince.
- He's here. - Who?

360
00:52:04,574 --> 00:52:09,102
U our dear prince from Delhi
His car had a 4-tyre flat.

361
00:52:09,579 --> 00:52:15,176
ls he coming in a chariot?
So come and see that.

362
00:52:39,843 --> 00:52:43,074
Welcome to lndia, son-in-law.
Welcome to lndia.

363
00:53:09,139 --> 00:53:10,299
All the guests are here.

364
00:53:11,842 --> 00:53:15,710
U our father has invited so many
people. Raju must be nervous.

365
00:53:18,014 --> 00:53:22,917
Meet the Asst. Police Comm.
of our area, Mr. U adav.

366
00:53:23,553 --> 00:53:30,254
Bless you... it's all right.
So...

367
00:53:30,727 --> 00:53:34,527
- lf you have a problem, call me.
- What problem with you around, sir?

368
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:39,394
l mean if anyone is to be pulled up.
l just jailed a minister, you see.

369
00:53:40,637 --> 00:53:43,936
- What goes on here?
- Nothing. Come, have some snacks.

370
00:53:52,415 --> 00:53:56,818
Pay your respects, son.
Not mine, this gentleman's.

371
00:53:57,721 --> 00:53:58,813
Bless you...

372
00:54:02,692 --> 00:54:05,354
- Cool, sir. - Cool? U ou're
feeling cold with a coat on?

373
00:54:05,662 --> 00:54:09,291
- No. ''Cool'' means ''fine, thanks''.
- Why thank?

374
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:18,505
- O, wifey... - Right here.
- Come dear, let's go.

375
00:54:21,811 --> 00:54:24,439
ln Punjab they hit you like this,
and show their affection.

376
00:54:25,248 --> 00:54:29,548
The chair, sir!
Chair, sir, l say!

377
00:54:35,158 --> 00:54:39,822
- He doesn't know Hindi you see.
Say ''Chair''. - Go to hell!

378
00:54:44,367 --> 00:54:48,235
Baba, someone has cast an evil
eye on him. Ever since he's here...

379
00:54:48,505 --> 00:54:51,099
...his health has been bad.
Give him a remedy for it.

380
00:55:02,185 --> 00:55:06,121
He's just warding off evil
spirits. Try to understand.

381
00:55:08,592 --> 00:55:13,325
He too is having the same
problem. So please... Just once...

382
00:55:13,763 --> 00:55:15,594
No, no. l'm fine...

383
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:21,766
- This is Love from lndia!
- Shall we sit down?

384
00:55:24,374 --> 00:55:26,706
- How is he?
- Shall l tell you the truth?

385
00:55:27,377 --> 00:55:31,074
- He's like a prince!
- Sweet.

386
00:55:32,382 --> 00:55:37,911
- Where's Ganga.
- l'll just go and see.

387
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:47,627
What's wrong? Why the delay?
Where's Ganga? - Getting ready.

388
00:55:48,064 --> 00:55:51,227
Dressing up in finery...
There she comes now.

389
00:55:51,701 --> 00:55:54,261
- How am l looking?
- Wonderful!

390
00:55:55,472 --> 00:56:00,000
- Didn't l say that when l get
ready, you'll just gawk! - Sure.

391
00:56:00,543 --> 00:56:03,603
- lsn't she looking beautiful?
- Sorry, but she resembles an ape!

392
00:56:03,913 --> 00:56:08,782
Try to understand.
Rajiv hates such heavy ornaments.

393
00:56:09,185 --> 00:56:12,848
- He's American and likes simplicity.
- But this is lndian simplicity.

394
00:56:13,356 --> 00:56:17,725
No! l'll show you simplicity.
Hold this, and you come with me.

395
00:56:18,495 --> 00:56:22,864
Take this off and why did you
wear these gold ornaments?

396
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:28,126
- What will you have? Tea, juice?
- l'll prefer tea.

397
00:57:29,032 --> 00:57:30,056
Will you have tea, too?

398
00:57:34,938 --> 00:57:37,736
- How much sugar?
- Just one spoon.

399
00:57:42,479 --> 00:57:44,913
- Two more.
- Two more? ...Two.

400
00:57:46,149 --> 00:57:48,845
- Okay, one more.
- One more.

401
00:57:51,554 --> 00:57:55,046
- Do one thing, add the whole lot.
- The whole lot?

402
00:58:12,408 --> 00:58:14,205
U ou're pretty smart!

403
00:58:24,254 --> 00:58:27,849
Rajiv... How did you like Ganga?

404
00:58:28,825 --> 00:58:30,383
Let me sleep. My head is aching!

405
00:58:35,165 --> 00:58:36,928
Okay then, shall l...

406
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,862
consider her for myself?

407
00:58:48,978 --> 00:58:53,438
U ou haven't told me how
did you find Rajiv?

408
00:58:55,185 --> 00:58:57,653
- U ou didn't tell me either.
- Did you like him, or not?

409
00:58:59,055 --> 00:59:01,922
- Liked him not. - Tell me.
- U ou tell me. - No, you first.

410
00:59:02,659 --> 00:59:06,993
- Tell me... - U ou tell me.
- Okay, l'll tell you.

411
00:59:08,031 --> 00:59:11,023
l think you didn't
like Rajiv at all.

412
00:59:12,435 --> 00:59:13,732
When did l say that?

413
00:59:18,541 --> 00:59:19,701
So! U ou like him, eh?

414
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:24,812
Dad, it's bad. Surajdev
called everyone, but us.

415
00:59:25,281 --> 00:59:28,409
He got scared you may not
spoil his daughter's chances.

416
00:59:28,918 --> 00:59:32,854
l don't spoil chances,
l stop them.

417
00:59:33,189 --> 00:59:37,125
- And what if they get engaged?
- Then? - We'll break it.

418
00:59:39,062 --> 00:59:45,160
Surajdev, let my good days
come. Then l'll show you.

419
00:59:46,836 --> 00:59:51,432
- Where are you going? - To give
milk to Rajiv. - Give it here.

420
00:59:52,675 --> 00:59:56,167
- Ganga, go give this to Rajiv.
- Me? - U es!

421
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:59,746
Take it, l said. Hurry up.

422
01:00:01,484 --> 01:00:04,851
- Why her, and not me?
- Arjun said...

423
01:00:05,154 --> 01:00:07,645
...Ganga will give him
the milk today.

424
01:01:49,058 --> 01:01:52,391
ln our country a snake is not
considered as an animal, but God.

425
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:56,856
U ou have your milk and sleep.
Nothing will happen.

426
01:02:13,116 --> 01:02:16,847
- U ou?
- l want to meet you...

427
01:02:17,887 --> 01:02:21,050
- ...in private.
- Why in private?

428
01:02:22,258 --> 01:02:26,285
- Well, won't it be better if we
chat a bit? - So let's chat.

429
01:02:27,296 --> 01:02:28,126
Not here.

430
01:02:29,132 --> 01:02:35,662
- Then where? - ln those fields.
Behind the wind-mill.

431
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:42,370
May l ask my mother?

432
01:02:44,113 --> 01:02:48,174
- Can't you make your own decisions?
- lt's not that...

433
01:02:49,152 --> 01:02:50,983
Just wait here. l'll just come.

434
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:56,950
Auntie, may l go in the
fields with Rajiv?

435
01:02:58,828 --> 01:03:01,592
ln the fields? Why ask
me, you shameless girl!

436
01:03:01,898 --> 01:03:06,528
Ask your mother!
Did you hear? U our Rajiv...

437
01:03:06,803 --> 01:03:11,570
...wants to take Ganga in the
fields, behind the wind-mill!

438
01:03:12,208 --> 01:03:17,646
- Who wants to take her there?
- He came as a guest, mother...

439
01:03:18,047 --> 01:03:21,175
...and he wants to take the girl
behind bushes right in front of us!

440
01:03:21,517 --> 01:03:26,045
- Sister! Will you shut up?
- Okay, l'll shut up!

441
01:03:26,389 --> 01:03:29,825
Let her go behind the wind-mill.
lt's very hot, isn't it?!!

442
01:03:30,293 --> 01:03:35,526
- Speak softly.
- Why? l can't speak softly.

443
01:03:35,865 --> 01:03:43,203
Are we thieves? Girls do not
roll in the hay before marriage!

444
01:03:43,539 --> 01:03:45,598
lf you think it's proper, send her.

445
01:03:46,142 --> 01:03:50,977
Sending her to America! What
are you doing there? Come...

446
01:03:53,082 --> 01:03:54,071
Congratulations!

447
01:03:59,055 --> 01:04:04,550
My dear brother, if you
wanted to meet Ganga,...

448
01:04:05,294 --> 01:04:09,253
- ...why talk of the fields?
- What's wrong with the fields?

449
01:04:10,466 --> 01:04:14,061
Look. ln lndian etiquette,
before marriage,...

450
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:16,998
...there are various
rules and norms.

451
01:04:23,479 --> 01:04:26,312
A river, is no river without water.

452
01:04:26,883 --> 01:04:32,150
- Wind is no wind without sound
to it. - That marriage...

453
01:04:32,388 --> 01:04:35,186
...is no marriage
without a love-story.

454
01:04:38,628 --> 01:04:40,493
- U ou do understand what
l mean by that. - No.

455
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:44,691
Look, before Rajiv and
Ganga get married...

456
01:04:44,967 --> 01:04:50,030
...it's vital that they click!
And they'll click...

457
01:04:50,439 --> 01:04:54,603
...only when they chat. And they
will chat, only when they meet.

458
01:04:56,245 --> 01:05:01,114
- Why should we mind if they meet?
- U ou don't mind...

459
01:05:02,618 --> 01:05:06,247
...but yesterday, that scene which
Auntie made about the fields...

460
01:05:07,557 --> 01:05:12,859
l'm being frank. Rajiv is born in
America. He'll just run away!

461
01:05:13,896 --> 01:05:17,354
No, no. lf you wish, tomorrow,
we can take them out...

462
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:21,227
...on a sight seeing tour and
show them the fort there. - Auntie...

463
01:05:21,671 --> 01:05:24,401
- Why should l mind? My lips
are sealed! - Hear that?

464
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:29,140
No, son. lt'll be as you say.
Shut up! Will you, my dear?

465
01:05:29,545 --> 01:05:31,706
lt will be as Arjun says.

466
01:05:33,583 --> 01:05:36,347
Don't go too far from the
hearts that are broken.

467
01:05:37,787 --> 01:05:41,723
But don't go too near the ones
that are beating together, either.

468
01:05:59,141 --> 01:06:02,338
The one who drives a Mercedes
is pedaling a cycle...

469
01:06:02,979 --> 01:06:07,109
See how in various ways
he's wooing you! Too good!

470
01:06:08,084 --> 01:06:11,520
But l'm no less either.
U ou saw my artistry, didn't you?

471
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:16,988
How l convinced the elders,
that we'll go on a picnic.

472
01:06:18,828 --> 01:06:23,424
This will give you a
chance to talk to Rajiv.

473
01:06:27,436 --> 01:06:31,463
He loves you a lot.
Sometimes l think...

474
01:06:31,774 --> 01:06:35,073
...if he loves you so much now,
how much he'll love you later! Mad!

475
01:06:38,781 --> 01:06:44,219
What is it, Ganga?
Why are you staring at me?

476
01:06:47,056 --> 01:06:49,354
- May l ask you something?
- Sure, go ahead.

477
01:06:50,826 --> 01:06:54,523
l know that l haven't driven Rajiv
mad, but your efforts have.

478
01:06:55,931 --> 01:06:58,627
U ou are his friend,
and brother too.

479
01:06:59,869 --> 01:07:04,169
But some kind of bond is forged
between you and l also.

480
01:07:06,375 --> 01:07:10,812
A bond of implicit trust
and friendship. Right?

481
01:07:12,214 --> 01:07:15,342
What do you want to say?

482
01:07:16,886 --> 01:07:21,619
l want to ask you,...
ls Rajiv right for me?

483
01:07:24,527 --> 01:07:27,928
After so many days now,
this kind of a question...

484
01:07:28,831 --> 01:07:34,895
He has hidden something from me.
U esterday l was tidying his clothes.

485
01:07:36,305 --> 01:07:40,002
And l found this.
lt's not that he smokes...

486
01:07:40,743 --> 01:07:45,237
...but the fact that he hid it.
lf he has any more such vices...

487
01:07:45,781 --> 01:07:50,411
...please tell me now.
So that l can decide properly.

488
01:07:51,821 --> 01:07:56,417
Look, your advice can
either make my life...

489
01:07:56,959 --> 01:07:58,517
...or, ruin it.

490
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:04,894
Ganga, you're totally mistaken.

491
01:08:05,968 --> 01:08:08,903
This packet is not Rajiv's.
lt's mine.

492
01:08:11,273 --> 01:08:16,210
Actually, sometimes, l do smoke.

493
01:08:17,346 --> 01:08:19,541
But Rajiv... drinks and cigarettes...

494
01:08:21,317 --> 01:08:26,152
- There must be a lighter with this.
- l'd rather you not smoke either!

495
01:08:26,722 --> 01:08:29,850
- A man looks so rotten.
- Shall l leave it?

496
01:08:30,493 --> 01:08:35,294
- Leave it. - There!
- U ou're very bad!

497
01:08:36,132 --> 01:08:37,599
- Am l still?

498
01:14:50,038 --> 01:14:52,438
U es, Daddy. Rajiv has liked Ganga.

499
01:14:55,077 --> 01:14:58,012
- U ou're not saying anything, son.
- Daddy...

500
01:14:58,447 --> 01:15:01,416
...l think Ganga should go
to the U.S. before marriage.

501
01:15:01,817 --> 01:15:05,275
- See the culture, the people there.
- Right!

502
01:15:05,821 --> 01:15:09,951
- lt's the girl who will live abroad
not the boy. - lt'll be nice...

503
01:15:10,225 --> 01:15:13,490
...if she comes with us to America
for 1-2 months and sees everything.

504
01:15:15,964 --> 01:15:19,331
l'm happy to see you
speak so maturely.

505
01:15:20,602 --> 01:15:24,868
- l'll talk to her father.
- What are you saying?

506
01:15:25,474 --> 01:15:29,433
That we send her to America
all alone? Are you alright?

507
01:15:29,778 --> 01:15:33,680
What's wrong in that? He's a friend.
Can't she go to my friend's house?

508
01:15:34,683 --> 01:15:40,781
lndian girls do not go
without marrying, son.

509
01:15:41,924 --> 01:15:45,223
- l too have decided that
she will not go. - Correct.

510
01:15:46,028 --> 01:15:49,429
Okay. Call the whole thing off.
l'll speak to Kishorilal.

511
01:15:50,265 --> 01:15:54,167
Then what was the need for all this?
Why did you call him all the way?

512
01:15:54,469 --> 01:15:55,868
Then what do we do?
Become Americans?

513
01:16:00,175 --> 01:16:01,301
Come, Kishorilal.

514
01:16:09,651 --> 01:16:15,988
How can we send the girl without a
betrothal or a confirmed relation?

515
01:16:16,658 --> 01:16:19,991
Just think.
We live in a small town.

516
01:16:20,729 --> 01:16:24,358
- What will people say?
- They've already started gossiping.

517
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:28,802
And suppose she returns
without marrying your son?

518
01:16:33,041 --> 01:16:35,009
- l've got a solution to it.
- What?

519
01:16:38,947 --> 01:16:42,781
We'll get Rajiv and Ganga
engaged this week itself.

520
01:16:44,286 --> 01:16:46,481
Then she'll go with us,
and after a month...

521
01:16:46,989 --> 01:16:51,858
...we'll get them married in
U.S.A. in style. Okay?

522
01:16:52,327 --> 01:16:55,785
Okay? U ou shouldn't have
any objection now.

523
01:16:57,032 --> 01:17:00,524
Why should we have any objection to
an engagement? Right, my dear?

524
01:17:01,103 --> 01:17:04,539
- Say you agree. lt's okay.
- What l say is...

525
01:17:05,107 --> 01:17:09,407
- ...you all come with us.
- No, that's impossible.

526
01:17:09,745 --> 01:17:14,079
lt's our harvest season, you see.
None of us can make it.

527
01:17:14,549 --> 01:17:17,882
lf none of us can make it
my daughter can go instead.

528
01:17:18,153 --> 01:17:21,179
America? No, l can't.
How can you suggest it?

529
01:17:22,224 --> 01:17:25,284
U es, that'll be perfect.
lf you stay with Ganga...

530
01:17:25,594 --> 01:17:29,496
- ...she won't feel lonely.
- Go, Mom.

531
01:17:31,099 --> 01:17:34,500
Okay. lf you all insist, l'll go.

532
01:17:35,137 --> 01:17:38,664
So it's all fixed now.
Engagement on Monday.

533
01:17:38,907 --> 01:17:43,469
Then Ganga's ''farewell'' and on
that note give us sweet-meats.

534
01:17:45,213 --> 01:17:50,310
U es, it'll be a farewell, no doubt.
Who knows when she will visit lndia?

535
01:18:17,279 --> 01:18:19,372
What's this? U ou're
sitting all alone here?

536
01:18:20,682 --> 01:18:24,982
What's up? U ou're getting engaged
and you're crying?

537
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:32,390
l know. U ou don't wish
to leave Papa, do you?

538
01:18:39,001 --> 01:18:42,266
- l don't want to go anywhere!
- That is unavoidable, dear.

539
01:18:44,873 --> 01:18:48,570
All girls marry and
go away one day.

540
01:18:49,778 --> 01:18:53,612
Leaving their mother
and father behind.

541
01:18:56,051 --> 01:18:57,484
Forever and ever.

542
01:18:59,888 --> 01:19:01,082
Why are you crying now?

543
01:19:03,825 --> 01:19:08,558
- U ou made me cry. - U ou did.
- U ou made me cry. - U ou did!

544
01:19:10,932 --> 01:19:15,665
Come on. The engagement and the
farewell are both on Monday.

545
01:19:16,438 --> 01:19:20,966
- The cards will be sent today.
- Cards? Must be Arjun's idea.

546
01:19:22,811 --> 01:19:25,712
What! Kusum engaged to Rajiv?

547
01:19:26,148 --> 01:19:32,383
Never! Did you hear that?

548
01:19:32,921 --> 01:19:36,254
This is absolutely unfair.
The whole town knows...

549
01:19:36,658 --> 01:19:43,291
- ...that Ganga was to marry my son.
- lndeed.

550
01:19:43,732 --> 01:19:48,135
He hasn't just insulted me,
but this whole town!

551
01:19:48,537 --> 01:19:51,131
- That's a lie! Uncle had not
promised you anything. - Shut up!

552
01:19:52,274 --> 01:19:57,007
Stop jumping, son. Will you?
That foreigner is marrying Ganga.

553
01:19:57,612 --> 01:20:03,175
Rajiv is no foreigner.
He's the son of an lndian.

554
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:06,785
That bastard Kishorilal...

555
01:20:15,831 --> 01:20:19,096
First they broke the engagement,
now they're breaking my son! Help!

556
01:20:27,375 --> 01:20:30,503
No Rajiv, No. No, Arjun.

557
01:20:30,979 --> 01:20:34,813
- U ou will not fight. For my sake.
- We'll have to decide Surajdev.

558
01:20:35,117 --> 01:20:38,814
What do you mean? l'm her father.
l'll give her away where l want to.

559
01:20:39,387 --> 01:20:42,185
How will you decide? Tell us.
We'll decide today, right now.

560
01:20:42,757 --> 01:20:47,854
Then come let's have a combat.
The winner will take Ganga.

561
01:20:48,897 --> 01:20:54,665
- Agreed. Today, either you take
her, or l will. - Good!

562
01:20:55,637 --> 01:20:59,664
Even Lord Rama had to lift
Lord Shiva's bow, to win Sita.

563
01:21:00,775 --> 01:21:04,575
So today whoever wins,
shall be Ganga's groom!

564
01:21:06,781 --> 01:21:11,309
This is too much! My daughter's
future will be decided by bouts?

565
01:21:11,453 --> 01:21:15,856
Then admit you're a cheat, and
that you sold yourself to a N.R.l.

566
01:21:16,591 --> 01:21:21,460
Suraj is not a cheat,
but you are!

567
01:21:22,597 --> 01:21:24,792
And we'll give you
an apt reply to it.

568
01:21:26,201 --> 01:21:28,897
Good thing the Headman
mentioned about Ram-Sita.

569
01:21:30,805 --> 01:21:33,467
My son's shoulder is willing
to carry any bow you wish.

570
01:21:34,609 --> 01:21:40,172
Tell me, which bow do you have?
Let me see how strong your son is!

571
01:21:41,416 --> 01:21:44,647
- l'm ready, Daddy.
- So Manuchand...

572
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:48,383
...what's your choice?
Running, wrestling, boxing...

573
01:21:50,692 --> 01:21:53,126
- ''Kabbaddi'' !
- ''Kabbaddi''?

574
01:21:54,029 --> 01:22:00,593
Okay. Today and now!

575
01:22:01,503 --> 01:22:05,166
- What? A kabbaddi-match?
- U es.

576
01:22:05,473 --> 01:22:10,035
- And the winner will be sis's
bridegroom! - Nonsense.

577
01:22:10,712 --> 01:22:13,510
Go and see. Stop them.

578
01:22:14,683 --> 01:22:17,311
No... lt won't be possible.

579
01:22:38,306 --> 01:22:41,002
Don't you worry, Suraj.
We'll defeat them.

580
01:28:59,687 --> 01:29:03,919
U ou'll say, take care of Ganga,
and l'll say she's my daughter now.

581
01:29:04,459 --> 01:29:06,620
- So you have no right.
- Right on.

582
01:29:09,931 --> 01:29:13,025
- Arjun hasn't come as yet.
- He's not coming with us.

583
01:29:13,501 --> 01:29:17,335
- Why? - He'll stay back a bit more.
- Meaning?

584
01:29:17,872 --> 01:29:21,330
Meaning... Here he comes.
Ask him yourself.

585
01:29:26,881 --> 01:29:30,214
- For Rajiv and you.
- What's this? U ou're not coming?

586
01:29:31,252 --> 01:29:35,484
l've to go back to Mathura, where
my father has an old house.

587
01:29:35,823 --> 01:29:39,259
l've to rebuild it as a music-school.
So l'll have a lot of paper work.

588
01:29:39,861 --> 01:29:43,058
- U ou didn't tell me this earlier.
- Didn't get a chance to.

589
01:29:43,431 --> 01:29:46,457
- Keep these. - What for? l'm going
abroad for the first time.

590
01:29:46,934 --> 01:29:50,961
- l'll be so lonely. - Why?
There is Daddy, Rajiv, your aunt...

591
01:29:51,372 --> 01:29:54,068
- And many others who'll take care.
- But you won't be there.

592
01:29:55,209 --> 01:29:58,667
U ou had said you'd be there
with me. l agreed only because...

593
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:04,345
Look. My responsibility,
and work ends here.

594
01:30:05,953 --> 01:30:11,152
Now your life and my life
go different ways.

595
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:15,796
- Okay?
- Why are you saying that?

596
01:30:17,965 --> 01:30:23,062
Because, now you've to become
a responsible daughter-in-law.

597
01:30:23,304 --> 01:30:25,898
- Abroad, and live happily with
everybody. - Don't give a sermon.

598
01:30:26,441 --> 01:30:30,935
- Hurry. U our plane will leave
without you. - l can go alone.

599
01:30:31,312 --> 01:30:34,406
l don't need your help.
l can take care of myself.

600
01:30:47,195 --> 01:30:48,423
Crazy kid!

601
01:31:05,446 --> 01:31:10,816
Are you Arjun Sagar? - U es.
- A passenger's sent you this note.

602
01:31:18,259 --> 01:31:20,056
Arjun, come soon.
