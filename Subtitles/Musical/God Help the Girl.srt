00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,855
with all the Swiss Germans here.

361
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:51,856
No, there's no way she's getting
past the big Swiss German.

362
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:57,562
Life is tragic.

363
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:58,863

364
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:10,808
Eve.

365
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,579
I've been out
of the city for a while.

366
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:16,814
Maybe you can tell me
if I start acting conspicuous.

367
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:23,454
I like conspicuous.

368
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:27,859

thing about you and blow it up.

369
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:36,167
-Are your hands cold?
-No.

370
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:39,370
I bet if I touched your hands
they'd be freezing cold.

371
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,372
My hands are fine.

372
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:53,284
Cold, knew it.

373
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:56,788
I couldn't stand that, I mean,
I'd get sick instantly.

374
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:59,724

of an abandoned rabbit.

419
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,699

Maybe we could work

Or you could help
her write something.

but she doesn't quite have

00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:55,559
Hi, James.

429
00:29:57,496 --> 00:30:00,097
Cassie, this is Eve.

430
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:14,845
Do you mind us
hijacking your lesson?

431
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:17,715
It depends, are you going
to make me play scales?

432
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,285
o.
-Then I don't mind.

433
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:26,657
So, what would you rather do?

434
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,326
Well, when I started this,
I was hoping

435
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,729
we were going to write songs.

436
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,831
It does help to know
your instrument first.

437
00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:37,034
(sighs)

438
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,476
I think sometimes
you just need to know the chord

439
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:48,112
you're looking for.

440
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:50,648
Yeah, but how do you find it?

441
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:51,215
Well, maybe we should just
try and write a song right now.

442
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,120
-Okay.
-Well...

443
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:57,822
a good song isn't written
by committee, I don't know if--

444
00:30:57,823 --> 00:30:58,589
Cassie, what have
you done today?

445
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:03,594
Just tell me the first thing
you did

446
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:05,396
when you got out
of bed this morning.

447
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:08,099
Well, I meant to get up
really early,

448
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,835
but I was still the last nap
and I had to fill the dishwasher

449
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:12,803
'cause I was last downstairs,
which was a rip-off

450
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:15,139
'cause I didn't get
anything to eat.

451
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,441
And then what happened?

452
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,877
I jumped in the shower,
got dressed.

453
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,446
Captain was crying
so I had to take her out.

454
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:23,914
She's my dog.

455
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,282
We went to the park,

456
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:27,384
climbed the fence
for a shortcut.

458
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,623
Captain was acting strange,
she kept running ahead

459
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,525
and then got into
the herb garden

460
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:36,694

"Romeo and Juliet."

485
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:28,272
It's a good song.
The guy who wrote that song

486
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:30,207
is a songwriting deity.

it's not for them to decide.

721
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:11,167
It belongs
to the university.

722
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:21,044
You're serious?

723
00:46:21,045 --> 00:46:22,746

724
00:46:22,747 --> 00:46:24,314
How does it go?

725
00:46:24,315 --> 00:46:26,016
You have to paddle.

726
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:27,317
Where are we going?

727
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:28,952
That way.

728
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:30,120
But what's that way?

729
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:31,021
Are we going
through the country

730
00:46:31,022 --> 00:46:32,122
or through the city?

731
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:34,124
Are we canoeing
through traffic?

732
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,558
Well, you can either
go to Edinburgh

733
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:37,761
or you can
go to the sea.

734
00:46:37,762 --> 00:46:39,796
There's a fork up ahead.

735
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:43,300
Anyway, it's kayaking,
it's not canoeing.

736
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,502
We call this canoeing
where I grew up.

737
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,269
Yes, well, we're

741
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:56,513
Well, because when
I finished high school

742
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,251
I met this boy

743
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:02,118
who was in a band

744
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:04,587

745
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:05,221
What?

746
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:06,790
She's a groupie.

747
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:08,325
Don't listen to James.

748
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:09,959
Was he good looking?
Was he really good looking?

749
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,860
He was quite
good looking.

750
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:11,761
Was he Australian?

751
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:12,829
He was Australian,

752
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,298
but he moved over here
with his band.

753
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:17,567
I guess I followed him,
I don't know.

754
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:19,803
Well, why were you
not in the band?

755
00:47:19,804 --> 00:47:21,638
Well, I wasn't really
playing music then.

756
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:23,473
So you crossed multiple
continents for a boy.

757
00:47:26,811 --> 00:47:29,145
This is weird.

758
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:30,246
You want to go back?

759

No, it's good weird.

00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:07,384
she's an English rose.

773
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:09,386
But I bet she's 30.

774
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,087
To deny the ned
would be to deny

775
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:13,890
the whole point
of this town.

776
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,358
What was that?

777
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,361
I'm just saying,
this is a ned city now.

778
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:20,096
It's a Victorian
theme park,

779
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:21,431
but it's run by neds.

780
00:48:21,432 --> 00:48:23,066
What happened
to the Victorians?

781
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,001
They built the city,

782
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:26,403
they used
the workforce,

783
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:29,472
then they fucked off
with the money.

784
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:31,541
I know more about the city
than I would say

785
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:33,343
60 percent
of the local residents.

786
00:48:33,344 --> 00:48:34,911
-What?
-I do.

787
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,580
I study the history
of this place, I've--

788
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,883
I have.

789
00:48:39,884 --> 00:48:41,951
Sorry, James,
you are English.

790
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:43,286
No, I'm not.

791
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:44,954
How long after you
were born in Scotland

792
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:47,090
did you live
in Scotland?

793
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:48,425
All right, well,
I was born here

794
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:50,994
and then after like
six months we moved.

795
00:48:50,995 --> 00:48:52,562
Oh, that doesn't count.

796
00:48:52,563 --> 00:48:55,365
If you went
to the pub now,

797
00:48:55,366 --> 00:48:56,199
around the corner,

798
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,400
and you were like,

799
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:59,235
"Hi, everyone,
I'm Scottish,"

800
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:00,770
someone would punch
you in the face.

801
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:01,471
Absolutely.

802
00:49:01,472 --> 00:49:03,406
No they wouldn't.

803
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:06,976
Maybe I'd
punch them back.

804
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:09,546
We're definitely
a band now.

805
00:49:09,547 --> 00:49:11,581

a band now?

806
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:14,350

only a band would do.

808
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:19,022
Day trips,
canoeing, kayaking.

809

What do you think, James?

810
00:49:24,862 --> 00:49:27,697
I think we are
three people paddling a boat,

811
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:30,133
that's all.

812
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:32,535
So what makes
a band then?

813
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:35,805
You don't make a band,
a band makes you.

814
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:39,576
It comes up
and sweeps you along.

it's been on the slide
since 1969.

I don't think so.

1269
01:13:13,089 --> 01:13:14,923

sent back to pick through

with a massive magnifying glass.

you know, like a Christmas card
with camels in.

1558

a man standing over me.

my own fate.

1569

1576
01:34:57,825 --> 01:34:58,792

still play the show?

1587
01:35:36,864 --> 01:35:40,133

huge Jiffy bag on reception.
