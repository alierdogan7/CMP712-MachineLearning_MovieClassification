1
00:00:00,974 --> 00:00:06,513
Namwon town of Honam Province

2
00:00:06,513 --> 00:00:11,985
Was known as Dae-bang
region long ago.

3
00:00:11,985 --> 00:00:17,557
On the east is Chiri Mountain.
On the west is Chuksung River.

4
00:00:17,557 --> 00:00:20,994
Water flowed southwards
with high mountains above.

5
00:00:20,994 --> 00:00:24,987
Full of spiritual energy,
Namwon bred many pretty people.

6
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:29,703
With endless graves of loyal
officials,

7
00:00:29,703 --> 00:00:32,138
can unswerving loyalty
not exist?

8
00:00:32,138 --> 00:00:35,976
In King Sukjong's early reign,

9
00:00:35,976 --> 00:00:41,214
there lived the only son
of a local governor.

10
00:00:41,214 --> 00:00:44,184
He was 15 years old.

11
00:00:44,184 --> 00:00:47,220
Since he was handsome and righteous,

12
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:51,625
he was a great man.

13
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:59,199
On one fine day,

14
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,535
he called his servant Pangja...

15
00:01:02,535 --> 00:01:06,006
Hey Pangja!

16
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:10,043
Yes master.

17
00:01:10,043 --> 00:01:20,086
I've been here several months,
but I've yet to go sightseeing.

18
00:01:20,086 --> 00:01:21,321
Do you know of any good places?

19
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:24,658
Why does a diligent student
like you need to know?

20
00:01:24,658 --> 00:01:29,529
You're foolish.

21
00:01:29,529 --> 00:01:31,798
All the greatest scholars
have visited famous sights.

22
00:01:31,798 --> 00:01:36,102
So tell me now.

23
00:01:36,102 --> 00:01:39,105
As you wish Master Lee.

24
00:01:39,105 --> 00:01:40,273
Out the north gate, Kyoryong
Fortress is a good place.

25
00:01:40,273 --> 00:01:44,266
Out the west is Sonwon Temple,
and to the east is Kwan Mausoleum.

26
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,803
To the south is Kwangharu Arbor,
Ojak Bridge and Yongju Pavilion.

27
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:11,226
They say they're the best places
to visit in the south provinces.

28
00:02:16,242 --> 00:02:30,090
From what you said,
Kwangharu seems the best.

29
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,083
Go get the horse ready.

30
00:02:33,326 --> 00:02:37,319
But your father forbids this,
and we'll get into trouble.

31
00:02:38,398 --> 00:02:40,800
I'll just get permission.

32
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,202
Go mount the saddle!

33
00:02:42,202 --> 00:02:46,372
He mounted the horse,

34
00:02:46,372 --> 00:02:50,365
and Pangja leads the way.

35
00:02:48,575 --> 00:02:51,077
a fan shaped like a
crane's yellow wing,

36
00:02:51,077 --> 00:02:55,682
he flips it open and blocks the sun.

37
00:02:55,682 --> 00:02:59,675
As he travels down the South Road,

38
00:02:59,152 --> 00:03:03,145
the breezy dust from each trot,

39
00:03:04,157 --> 00:03:08,150
flutters in the air

40
00:03:10,864 --> 00:03:14,857
with the scent of peach flowers...

41
00:03:12,899 --> 00:03:16,892
The governor's son is out.

42
00:03:16,803 --> 00:03:20,796
"I traveled from afar
to see Kwangharu's beauty."

43
00:03:21,141 --> 00:03:25,134
Juksung Mountain in the morning

44
00:03:24,277 --> 00:03:28,270
is still covered by late fog.

45
00:03:27,747 --> 00:03:31,740
The river water reflects

46
00:03:33,586 --> 00:03:37,579
green willows and flowering trees.

47
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:42,284
The spring wind blows gently.

48
00:03:41,728 --> 00:03:45,665
The beautiful columns

49
00:03:45,665 --> 00:03:49,658
soar high into the sky.

50
00:03:49,369 --> 00:03:53,362
The purplish-red tower

51
00:03:52,605 --> 00:03:56,598
embraces the sunlight
and shines radiantly.

52
00:03:55,809 --> 00:03:59,802
In old Wang Bal's poem,

53
00:03:58,711 --> 00:04:02,704
the palace where immortals lived

54
00:04:02,615 --> 00:04:06,608
must be Kwangharu.

55
00:04:05,652 --> 00:04:09,645
Kwangharu is beautiful,

56
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:14,283
but Ojak Bridge is better.

57
00:04:12,392 --> 00:04:16,385
If it is really Ojak bridge,

58
00:04:13,793 --> 00:04:17,786
then the legend of
Gyunwoo and his love Jiknya

59
00:04:18,198 --> 00:04:22,191
I'll be the Gyunwoo star
on Ojak bridge,

60
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:25,661
but who shall be my Jiknya?

61
00:04:23,636 --> 00:04:24,804
- Pangja.
- Yes, master.

62
00:04:24,804 --> 00:04:26,639
Today, we'll drink as friends
not as master and servant.

63
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:41,387
Who is the oldest of you two?

64
00:04:41,387 --> 00:04:45,380
Master, he's a few years older.

65
00:04:52,398 --> 00:04:56,870
Then you have a drink first.

66
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,341
Take this drink.

67
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:05,334
Today's your day.

68
00:05:04,244 --> 00:05:06,913
such a beautifully written poem.

69
00:05:06,913 --> 00:05:10,906
"I didn't recognize spring's arrival."

70
00:05:10,717 --> 00:05:14,710
"But everywhere, peach
flowers blossomed already."

71
00:05:13,486 --> 00:05:17,479
"A pair of butterflies
left the peach flower,

72
00:05:17,523 --> 00:05:21,516
but they returned missing it."

73
00:05:20,894 --> 00:05:21,995
White and red flowers.

74
00:05:21,995 --> 00:05:22,829
White and red flowers

75
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:26,232
from the flowery forest,

76
00:05:26,232 --> 00:05:30,036
an angelic girl appears.

77
00:05:30,036 --> 00:05:31,905
Like the sun or moon,

78
00:05:31,905 --> 00:05:36,542
this beautiful girl appears.

79
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:41,414
She arrives together

80
00:05:41,414 --> 00:05:43,917
with a girl about her age.

81
00:05:43,917 --> 00:05:46,953
The long twisted ropes,

82
00:05:46,953 --> 00:05:49,822
she grabs them

83
00:05:49,822 --> 00:05:58,364
with her delicate hands.

84
00:05:58,364 --> 00:06:04,003
She leans once,

85
00:06:04,003 --> 00:06:07,974
and swings up.

86
00:06:07,974 --> 00:06:21,287
She leans again,

87
00:06:21,287 --> 00:06:31,297
and swings back.

88
00:06:31,297 --> 00:06:32,031
If she flies higher,

89
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:34,534
she'll meet the Sowangmo angel.

90
00:06:34,534 --> 00:06:37,537
If she flies lower,

91
00:06:37,537 --> 00:06:40,406
she'll meet
the ancient Yoji empress.

92
00:06:40,406 --> 00:06:43,309
She is a girl,

93
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:47,914
but also an angel.

94
00:06:47,914 --> 00:06:52,585
One moment she's far away,

95
00:06:52,585 --> 00:07:02,462
the next she's very close.

96
00:07:02,462 --> 00:07:07,066
Her swings are in and out

97
00:07:07,066 --> 00:07:11,838
like a swallow's springs

98
00:07:11,838 --> 00:07:16,843
Her lovely motions
put Mongryong in a spell.

99
00:07:16,843 --> 00:07:21,447
Hey, Pangja.

100
00:07:21,447 --> 00:07:25,440
Yes...Yes, master.

101
00:07:26,652 --> 00:07:29,122
Look over there.

102
00:07:29,122 --> 00:07:32,025
Where?

103
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:42,802
Where my fan is pointed idiot.

104
00:07:42,802 --> 00:07:49,475
Oh, the wrestling match we passed by.

105
00:07:49,475 --> 00:07:51,911
Look carefully.

106
00:07:51,911 --> 00:07:54,881
Can't you see that girl
swinging in the forest?

107
00:07:54,881 --> 00:07:58,751
Looks like a fair maiden
on a swing. Let's go inside...

108
00:07:58,751 --> 00:08:04,557
You think a fair maiden
would be out here on a swing?

109
00:08:04,557 --> 00:08:15,701
You fool.

110
00:08:15,701 --> 00:08:19,694
You should even recognize a
passing dog in your hometown.

111
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:26,512
Oh, her name's Chunhyang.
She's an old courtesan's daughter.

112
00:08:26,512 --> 00:08:30,505
Looks like her maid
Hyangdan is with her too.

113
00:08:32,618 --> 00:08:38,458
A courtesan's daughter...

114
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:43,529
This is good.

115
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:48,935
- Pangja.
- Yes, master.

116
00:08:48,935 --> 00:08:54,907
Go and bring her here.

117
00:08:54,907 --> 00:09:01,514
Please, I can't...

118
00:09:01,514 --> 00:09:06,686
Pangja!

119
00:09:06,686 --> 00:09:12,125
She won't come.

120
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:16,118
Even though her mother's a courtesan,

121
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:23,536
Chunhyang is arrogant,
Well read, and writes poems.

122
00:09:23,536 --> 00:09:29,742
She's like a noble's daughter.

123
00:09:29,742 --> 00:09:33,735
She's a courtesan's daughter.
So can't I ask to see her face?

124
00:09:35,148 --> 00:09:40,987
- Bring her to me now.
- Oh master...

125
00:09:40,987 --> 00:09:46,559
Many officials, penniless rakes,
and even nobles of Namwon

126
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,552
tried endlessly to seduce
her, but they all failed.

127
00:09:52,098 --> 00:09:58,137
That's nonsense.

128
00:09:58,137 --> 00:10:02,130
The world's precious beauties,

129
00:10:04,577 --> 00:10:10,683
are destined to have an owner.

130
00:10:10,683 --> 00:10:16,589
So go and get her.

131
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:20,582
Pangja obeys and runs for Chunhyang.

132
00:10:22,028 --> 00:10:28,601
A fast, chic, and charming Pangja.

133
00:10:28,601 --> 00:10:33,673
Yet a flippant, fluttery,
and sly Pangja.

134
00:10:33,673 --> 00:10:39,545
Like a blue bird delivering
a letter to Sowangmo,

135
00:10:39,545 --> 00:10:45,051
a clever and quite cunning Pangja.

136
00:10:45,051 --> 00:10:50,957
He wears an ox felt hat with silk straps,

137
00:10:50,957 --> 00:10:57,597
a fake jacket and linen pants.

138
00:10:57,597 --> 00:11:03,035
With a stick for a pipe,

139
00:11:03,035 --> 00:11:09,242
and the front end of his
garment tied to his back,

140
00:11:09,242 --> 00:11:15,715
he takes one step,

141
00:11:15,715 --> 00:11:21,687
and takes another.

142
00:11:21,687 --> 00:11:25,680
Step, step, step, step away.

143
00:11:26,826 --> 00:11:32,131
He breaks a branch,

144
00:11:32,131 --> 00:11:37,703
and plays around

145
00:11:37,703 --> 00:11:42,908
with his staff.

146
00:11:42,908 --> 00:11:48,781
He picks up a stone,

147
00:11:48,781 --> 00:11:55,021
and throws it at a willow tree

148
00:11:55,021 --> 00:11:59,014
to scare the birds away.

149
00:12:01,127 --> 00:12:07,133
After his childish play,

150
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:12,972
he runs to the forest swing

151
00:12:12,972 --> 00:12:17,810
and yells as loud as he can...

152
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:21,847
...Chunhyang!

153
00:12:21,847 --> 00:12:26,786
Oh gosh! You fool!

154
00:12:26,786 --> 00:12:32,658
My lady almost had
a baby on the swing!

155
00:12:32,658 --> 00:12:38,931
What?!? A baby?

156
00:12:38,931 --> 00:12:44,337
Can you believe it?
A virgin gave birth!

157
00:12:44,337 --> 00:12:46,839
I meant she almost fell,
you idiot.

158
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:48,741
Chunhyang, there's a big problem.

159
00:12:48,741 --> 00:12:49,675
What is it?

160
00:12:49,675 --> 00:12:50,876
The governor's son came
to visit Kwangharu.

161
00:12:50,876 --> 00:12:53,879
He saw you on the swing,
and wants to meet you.

162
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:56,315
So let's go.

163
00:12:56,315 --> 00:13:00,308
How come the governor's son
is interested to meet me?

164
00:13:00,219 --> 00:13:05,257
Chunhyang is this...,
Chunhyang is that...

165
00:13:05,257 --> 00:13:08,027
Pangja, you must've
squealed everything about me.

166
00:13:08,027 --> 00:13:12,898
Chunhyang.
If you're a fair lady,

167
00:13:12,898 --> 00:13:15,301
then you should've swung
in your front or backyard.

168
00:13:15,301 --> 00:13:24,810
Tie a rope to your tree,
and make your own swing.

169
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,946
But in this open field,
you flaunt your bare ankles,

170
00:13:26,946 --> 00:13:30,939
tease us with your raised dress,
pretty smile, and giddy laugh,

171
00:13:29,915 --> 00:13:34,153
no wonder he fell for you.

172
00:13:34,153 --> 00:13:39,091
Let's go!

173
00:13:39,091 --> 00:13:44,864
I may be a lowly person,
but I'm not a courtesan.

174
00:13:44,864 --> 00:13:49,034
As a fair lady, you can't
just drag me to any man.

175
00:13:49,034 --> 00:13:55,274
So go alone.

176
00:13:55,274 --> 00:14:05,851
Chunhyang, wait!

177
00:14:05,851 --> 00:14:11,190
Do you want to get into
serious trouble?

178
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:20,833
The governor will torture you
for being rude to his son.

179
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:24,826
Is that what you want?

180
00:14:23,402 --> 00:14:25,905
Then tell him this.

181
00:14:25,905 --> 00:14:31,043
"The wild geese desire the sea,

182
00:14:31,043 --> 00:14:33,045
the crabs desire their holes,

183
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:37,038
and a butterfly desires a flower."

184
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:42,021
You idiot!
I didn't tell you to chase her away.

185
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:46,292
I didn't do such a thing.

186
00:14:46,292 --> 00:14:50,930
She cursed me in words
I didn't understand.

187
00:14:50,930 --> 00:15:00,372
And told me
to repeat them to you.

188
00:15:00,372 --> 00:15:06,345
What words?

189
00:15:06,345 --> 00:15:10,349
She said, "the wild geese
desires flowers..."

190
00:15:10,349 --> 00:15:12,218
...or was it the other way.

191
00:15:12,218 --> 00:15:16,822
Really?

192
00:15:16,822 --> 00:15:20,993
They're not insults,
but a proverb with deep meaning.

193
00:15:20,993 --> 00:15:24,897
Like the wild geese desire the sea,

194
00:15:24,897 --> 00:15:28,890
the crabs their holes,
and a butterfly's flower,

195
00:15:29,101 --> 00:15:33,405
she wants me to come
to her.

196
00:15:33,405 --> 00:15:37,176
Let's go.

197
00:15:37,176 --> 00:15:39,845
Now?

198
00:15:39,845 --> 00:15:43,838
My father granted half a day,
so we've got to go back.

199
00:15:46,185 --> 00:15:53,392
Studying in nature
is one of the scholar's ways,

200
00:15:53,392 --> 00:15:58,030
but you're forgetting
to balance your body and mind.

201
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:02,023
Don't forget to follow the 'six
exercises of a scholar,'

202
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:06,305
such as archery and horseback riding.

203
00:16:06,305 --> 00:16:10,109
Don't forget to do these things.

204
00:16:10,109 --> 00:16:12,444
If you get sleepy reading
old classics,

205
00:16:12,444 --> 00:16:16,437
read this book to stay awake.

206
00:16:16,282 --> 00:16:20,275
Young Lee sits at his
desk under Chunhyang's spell.

207
00:16:18,517 --> 00:16:20,386
He sees the six officials and
Pangja, and it's Chunhyang.

208
00:16:20,386 --> 00:16:24,379
His mother, and it's Chunhyang.
And his father, it's Chunhyang.

209
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:28,383
Shapes of the 'Gwon'...
the shape of a sphere, a cube,

210
00:16:28,928 --> 00:16:32,498
Chunhyang's shape,
my shape, the shape of lovers...

211
00:16:32,498 --> 00:16:34,533
they sleep together,
and make a baby's shape.

212
00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:41,307
Master Lee,
what kind of book is that?

213
00:16:41,307 --> 00:16:44,944
- 'The Book of Changes'.
- No, it's the 'Book of Lovers'.

214
00:16:44,944 --> 00:16:49,014
Is there anything about my shape too?

215
00:16:49,014 --> 00:16:54,353
No. There's nothing
about lowly servants.

216
00:16:54,353 --> 00:16:57,923
Bring me the
"Book of 1000 Characters."

217
00:16:57,923 --> 00:17:01,916
Why read a beginner's
book to study for your test?

218
00:17:02,428 --> 00:17:06,421
Because each character
has profound meaning.

219
00:17:05,364 --> 00:17:10,235
The sky was created on the first hour.

220
00:17:10,235 --> 00:17:14,228
Before four seasons existed,

221
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:19,133
in the empty space lies the 'sky.'

222
00:17:20,012 --> 00:17:24,005
The earth was created
on the second hour.

223
00:17:22,147 --> 00:17:42,167
Since it's composed
of minerals, wood, water, and fire

224
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:46,160
everything is born and raised
by the 'earth'.

225
00:17:43,435 --> 00:17:47,439
The profound and delicate color

226
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:51,432
of the North God is 'black'.

227
00:17:51,076 --> 00:17:55,069
The color symbolizing the first
of the five musical scales,

228
00:17:53,545 --> 00:17:55,014
and the center
of four sides is 'yellow'.

229
00:17:55,014 --> 00:17:59,007
We can see thousands of miles away

230
00:17:56,348 --> 00:17:59,551
on the large and high 'pavilion'.

231
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:03,544
Through the past and the present

232
00:18:02,788 --> 00:18:06,781
is the infinite and endless 'space'.

233
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:25,044
Go see how far the sun has fallen.

234
00:18:25,044 --> 00:18:31,417
It hasn't set yet, master.

235
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:41,160
Why is it moving so slowly today?

236
00:18:41,160 --> 00:19:12,825
It seemed to run so fast yesterday,

237
00:19:12,825 --> 00:19:16,818
but today it must have a boil in its foot.

238
00:19:15,527 --> 00:19:19,520
The guard shouts...

239
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,623
Close the gates!

240
00:19:20,332 --> 00:19:24,325
Young Lee is ecstatic and says...

241
00:19:24,436 --> 00:19:28,429
Let's go to Chunhyang's house.

242
00:19:26,538 --> 00:19:30,531
Pangja leads the way.

243
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:34,402
On the way to Chunhyang's home,

244
00:19:35,481 --> 00:19:39,474
a wide, dusty road leads into a trail,

245
00:19:40,085 --> 00:19:44,078
while the moonlight seeps
through the clouds.

246
00:19:43,889 --> 00:19:47,882
And with the green willows
between the flowering trees,

247
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:49,383
the night is so lovely.

248
00:19:49,428 --> 00:19:53,421
When they arrive at
Chunhyang's home,

249
00:19:52,664 --> 00:19:56,657
on the left are green pine trees,

250
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:02,363
on the right are green bamboo trees.

251
00:20:01,673 --> 00:20:05,666
The wavy pine trees stand calm.

252
00:20:03,342 --> 00:20:04,309
What shall we do now, master?

253
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:08,347
Call her.

254
00:20:08,347 --> 00:20:12,340
Sir, I think it would be better
if you call her yourself.

255
00:20:12,518 --> 00:20:16,511
Just do as I said. Call her now.

256
00:20:16,155 --> 00:20:18,690
Chunhyang! Are you awake?

257
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,393
My master is here
so come out this instant!

258
00:20:21,393 --> 00:20:24,496
Is this some prank?

259
00:20:24,496 --> 00:20:31,570
It's me Pangja.

260
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:35,674
What are you doing here?

261
00:20:35,674 --> 00:20:40,412
I've brought the governor's son.

262
00:20:40,412 --> 00:20:47,486
What?!?

263
00:20:47,486 --> 00:20:54,226
The governor's son? You fool!

264
00:20:54,226 --> 00:21:00,699
You should've told me
earlier he was coming.

265
00:21:00,699 --> 00:21:03,669
Look at you.

266
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:07,662
You're better off worrying
about your underpants instead.

267
00:21:07,172 --> 00:21:10,342
Oh gosh!

268
00:21:10,342 --> 00:21:14,335
Hyangdan!
Go open the gate for them.

269
00:21:13,478 --> 00:21:17,471
Master Lee, it's an honor to
have you at our humble home.

270
00:21:17,182 --> 00:21:21,175
Please do come in.

271
00:21:24,656 --> 00:21:27,793
'Lotus Pavilion...'

272
00:21:27,793 --> 00:21:31,786
The writing is refined and graceful.

273
00:21:30,195 --> 00:21:34,199
Who wrote this?

274
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:38,370
It's a girl's clumsy writing.

275
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:43,575
Although a lotus blossoms from clay,

276
00:21:43,575 --> 00:21:47,568
it's clean and enchanting,
and its scent travels for miles.

277
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,573
The farther a lotus scent
travels, the fresher and purer.

278
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:57,712
Your scent fills my room,
and intoxicates me.

279
00:21:56,555 --> 00:22:00,548
Instead of the lotus, you're
the best flower, Chunhyang.

280
00:21:58,891 --> 00:22:02,261
A painting of the famous Minister Kang.

281
00:22:02,261 --> 00:22:10,836
Did you draw this too?

282
00:22:10,836 --> 00:22:13,705
You're making me blush, Master Lee.

283
00:22:13,705 --> 00:22:17,698
While fishing with no bait,
he waits forever to meet King Moon,

284
00:22:16,808 --> 00:22:20,779
and later fulfills his dream.

285
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:26,051
While avoiding a disrupt world
and becoming a hermit,

286
00:22:26,051 --> 00:22:30,044
it's an ambitious life
that understands patience.

287
00:22:31,623 --> 00:22:35,594
Your wish to meet a good husband

288
00:22:35,594 --> 00:22:39,587
is shown in the painting.

289
00:22:39,064 --> 00:22:43,057
Did you come here thinking
I was an easy courtesan?

290
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:49,563
You're a talented writer,
and so am I.

291
00:22:48,674 --> 00:22:50,609
Don't you think its fate

292
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:54,602
that brought us here together?

293
00:22:53,745 --> 00:22:58,884
Hyangdan...

294
00:22:58,884 --> 00:23:02,877
He's fallen for Chunhyang
so you have to serve him well.

295
00:23:00,886 --> 00:23:04,879
If things go well, all of
Namwon might be Chunhyang's.

296
00:23:11,563 --> 00:23:14,066
Wolmae...

297
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:18,059
Part of the reason why I
brought him here is for me.

298
00:23:17,636 --> 00:23:21,940
So put in a good word for me.

299
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,912
Come on Wolmae.

300
00:23:26,912 --> 00:23:30,905
It's time for me move up,
so I can brag about myself.

301
00:23:28,747 --> 00:23:33,919
You're out of your mind.

302
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:42,694
- Don't steal my part of the gold.
- Wolmae...

303
00:23:42,694 --> 00:23:49,601
Wolmae?

304
00:23:49,601 --> 00:23:53,594
Just shut up,
and pull out the chicken hairs.

305
00:24:04,483 --> 00:24:20,599
Master Lee, this is my mother.

306
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:37,049
It's my honor to meet you.

307
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:44,923
Good evening.

308
00:24:44,923 --> 00:24:48,916
If I knew you were coming,
I would've greeted you formally.

309
00:24:52,964 --> 00:24:56,957
What brings a noble young man
to our house this evening?

310
00:25:01,706 --> 00:25:10,449
Please come in and sit comfortably.

311
00:25:10,449 --> 00:25:14,442
Thank you.

312
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:27,632
A few days ago,
I saw Chunhyang at Kwangharu,

313
00:25:27,632 --> 00:25:31,625
and I instantly adored her like
a butterfly desiring a flower.

314
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:39,533
How would you feel if I took
Chunhyang's hand as my wife?

315
00:25:44,716 --> 00:25:48,709
You're the son of a noble,
but Chunhyang is of a low class.

316
00:25:53,792 --> 00:25:57,785
If the butterfly just came to
pick the flower and leave,

317
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:10,642
our world would be miserable.

318
00:26:10,642 --> 00:26:13,478
So please stay and just
have a drink with us.

319
00:26:13,478 --> 00:26:19,017
I know this is informal,
but I think this is fate also.

320
00:26:19,017 --> 00:26:23,010
I'll be a good husband,
so give me your permission.

321
00:26:27,859 --> 00:26:31,852
When her father was
the governor of Namwon,

322
00:26:36,001 --> 00:26:38,170
he picked me as his
courtesan for one night,

323
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:46,945
and so she was conceived.

324
00:26:46,945 --> 00:26:49,614
He promised to take us to Seoul,

325
00:26:49,614 --> 00:26:51,683
but he passed away suddenly.

326
00:26:51,683 --> 00:26:58,657
So I raised her all by myself.

327
00:26:58,657 --> 00:27:02,650
And I did it with the utmost care.

328
00:26:59,991 --> 00:27:03,984
Since you're so insistent,
I could give you my approval,

329
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:06,064
but it's not my decision.

330
00:27:06,064 --> 00:27:10,057
Chunhyang, what do you think?

331
00:27:09,668 --> 00:27:13,661
Since Master Lee is so intent,
does a lowly girl have a choice?

332
00:27:13,171 --> 00:27:16,174
But...

333
00:27:16,174 --> 00:27:18,977
Since the future is unforeseeable,

334
00:27:18,977 --> 00:27:21,613
please vow...

335
00:27:21,613 --> 00:27:25,606
...your eternal love for me.

336
00:27:25,951 --> 00:27:29,944
"Like the sun and the moon,

337
00:27:27,986 --> 00:27:31,979
my love will never change."

338
00:27:30,922 --> 00:27:34,915
...Mongryong Lee

339
00:27:33,024 --> 00:27:35,794
Chunhyang, my child.

340
00:27:35,794 --> 00:27:37,162
Every woman does it.

341
00:27:37,162 --> 00:27:41,155
Don't be scared and do what he says.

342
00:27:39,231 --> 00:27:43,201
Also...

343
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:45,837
Lay this on the floor.

344
00:27:45,837 --> 00:27:49,941
He has to know you are a virgin.

345
00:27:49,941 --> 00:27:53,934
So don't forget to show
it to him.

346
00:27:57,148 --> 00:28:01,653
Chunhyang, come here.

347
00:28:01,653 --> 00:28:06,691
The night is late.
Let's sleep.

348
00:28:06,691 --> 00:28:13,632
I don't want to.

349
00:28:13,632 --> 00:28:16,935
Listen to me and come here.

350
00:28:16,935 --> 00:28:20,205
They say for a married couple

351
00:28:20,205 --> 00:28:24,109
ever-lasting happiness
depends on the first night.

352
00:28:24,109 --> 00:28:28,102
But if you grab the wife's hand,
they say it's bad luck.

353
00:28:27,646 --> 00:28:31,639
The moon is bright.
Oh yes, it is bright.

354
00:28:32,217 --> 00:28:35,720
The moon is brighter than ever.

355
00:28:35,720 --> 00:29:13,925
My wretched moon is bright.

356
00:29:13,925 --> 00:29:16,127
The reflection from
Chunhyang's room is bright.

357
00:29:16,127 --> 00:29:19,898
When I was young,

358
00:29:19,898 --> 00:29:23,891
I was known as
"Bright Moon" of Namwon,

359
00:29:22,901 --> 00:29:25,837
but I am bright no more

360
00:29:25,837 --> 00:29:29,830
as my face grew old.

361
00:29:30,175 --> 00:29:32,911
As one day, two days,
and several days pass,

362
00:29:32,911 --> 00:29:34,346
the young lovers'
shyness disappears,

363
00:29:34,346 --> 00:29:37,916
and they grow fondly intimate.

364
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:41,186
One day,
as they hug and roll around,

365
00:29:41,186 --> 00:29:47,225
they enjoy the 'Love Song.'

366
00:29:47,225 --> 00:29:51,218
Come here,
ride my back and we'll play.

367
00:29:49,961 --> 00:29:53,954
Come here,
ride my back and we'll play.

368
00:29:53,798 --> 00:29:57,791
Love, love, love, my love.

369
00:29:58,303 --> 00:30:02,296
What a love, my beloved.

370
00:30:03,241 --> 00:30:07,234
Yes...my love.

371
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:16,143
Oh...my love.

372
00:30:23,261 --> 00:30:27,254
What would you like to eat?

373
00:30:33,071 --> 00:30:37,064
What would you like to eat?

374
00:30:41,813 --> 00:30:45,806
A poked round watermelon

375
00:30:50,155 --> 00:30:54,148
poured with sweet white honey.

376
00:30:54,859 --> 00:30:58,852
Take the seeds out and taste
a juicy red piece.

377
00:30:59,931 --> 00:31:08,873
Savor it all in one big bite.

378
00:31:08,873 --> 00:31:12,866
No, I don't want any.

379
00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:18,772
Then what would you like to eat?

380
00:31:19,951 --> 00:31:23,944
What would you like to eat?

381
00:31:25,056 --> 00:31:32,897
A short, thick, and oval

382
00:31:32,897 --> 00:31:36,890
sweet cucumber,
eggplant, or melon?

383
00:31:40,939 --> 00:31:44,932
No, I don't want any.

384
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:52,272
Then what would you like to eat?

385
00:31:55,854 --> 00:31:59,847
What do you like to eat?

386
00:32:24,115 --> 00:32:27,051
Would you like cherries or grapes?

387
00:32:27,051 --> 00:32:31,044
A taffy or tangerine candy my dear?

388
00:32:30,221 --> 00:32:36,060
Then my love...

389
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:40,053
What would you like to eat?

390
00:32:37,095 --> 00:32:41,088
What do you want to eat?

391
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,498
How did they find out?

392
00:32:40,498 --> 00:32:45,136
Who's the bastard that told them?

393
00:32:45,136 --> 00:32:47,505
When the morning cock cried,

394
00:32:47,505 --> 00:32:51,498
the governor suddenly came and
demanded your whereabouts.

395
00:32:51,309 --> 00:32:55,302
Forgive me, I had no choice.

396
00:32:52,143 --> 00:32:56,136
Since your father knows
already, don't try to lie to him.

397
00:32:58,683 --> 00:33:02,676
Tell him you won't leave anymore
and you'll concentrate on the exam.

398
00:33:01,219 --> 00:33:06,057
Okay?

399
00:33:06,057 --> 00:33:10,050
My love, my treasure, my joy.

400
00:33:14,465 --> 00:33:18,458
Oh yes...you're my beloved.

401
00:33:24,475 --> 00:33:28,468
When you die, become a flower.

402
00:33:26,277 --> 00:33:30,270
A peach flower
that blossoms in the spring.

403
00:33:39,223 --> 00:33:43,216
When I die,
I'll become a tiger butterfly.

404
00:33:41,492 --> 00:33:43,528
On a beautiful spring day,

405
00:33:43,528 --> 00:33:47,521
if I dance around you,

406
00:33:47,432 --> 00:33:51,425
then recognize it is me.

407
00:33:53,571 --> 00:33:57,564
If the flower withers,

408
00:33:55,473 --> 00:33:59,466
the butterflies don't visit anymore.

409
00:33:57,408 --> 00:34:01,401
So I don't want to be a flower.

410
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,073
Then there's another after you die.

411
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:09,543
You become the Bell of Chongno,

412
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:12,512
and I'll be the hammer that hits it.

413
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:18,118
In the night,
I'll hit it 28 times,

414
00:34:18,463 --> 00:34:22,467
In the day,
I'll hit it 33 times.

415
00:34:22,467 --> 00:34:26,460
When I hit you,

416
00:34:25,536 --> 00:34:29,529
recognize it is me.

417
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:36,203
I don't want to be a bell.

418
00:34:34,412 --> 00:34:38,405
Then there's another after you die.

419
00:34:36,347 --> 00:34:40,340
You'll be the Yin,

420
00:34:41,352 --> 00:34:45,390
such as the 'earth',

421
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:49,383
'shade,' 'wife',

422
00:34:50,028 --> 00:34:54,021
and 'woman'.

423
00:34:57,602 --> 00:35:01,595
I'll be the Yang,

424
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:08,279
such as the 'sky',

425
00:35:08,279 --> 00:35:16,287
'sun',

426
00:35:16,287 --> 00:35:20,058
'light',

427
00:35:20,058 --> 00:35:23,661
'husband',

428
00:35:23,661 --> 00:35:27,654
and 'man'.

429
00:35:31,335 --> 00:35:35,328
We will live happily forever

430
00:35:35,206 --> 00:35:39,199
when we become 'one'.

431
00:35:39,043 --> 00:35:46,350
Hey Hyangdan.

432
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:50,343
Oh my! You're bad.

433
00:36:01,399 --> 00:36:10,675
Master Lee.

434
00:36:10,675 --> 00:36:14,668
Master Lee!

435
00:36:13,611 --> 00:36:17,604
What are you doing here?

436
00:36:18,883 --> 00:36:21,385
Where have you been lately?

437
00:36:21,385 --> 00:36:25,389
Were you too busy to study
and hear the good news?

438
00:36:25,389 --> 00:36:29,727
What sort of news father?

439
00:36:29,727 --> 00:36:34,265
I've been appointed
to the King's cabinet.

440
00:36:34,265 --> 00:36:37,201
I'll finish up here

441
00:36:37,201 --> 00:36:41,194
so take your mother
to Seoul ahead of me.

442
00:36:40,571 --> 00:36:49,247
Master Lee is here.

443
00:36:49,247 --> 00:36:53,240
My son-in-law is home!
But why are you here so early?

444
00:36:53,417 --> 00:36:57,555
Well, I'm glad.

445
00:36:57,555 --> 00:37:01,548
I just sewed an autumn jacket
for you. Come up and try it on.

446
00:37:02,293 --> 00:37:06,286
Why did you walk here without Pangja?

447
00:37:06,264 --> 00:37:10,257
Why do you look so worried?

448
00:37:10,568 --> 00:37:14,438
Did your father scold you?

449
00:37:14,438 --> 00:37:18,431
Please say something.

450
00:37:16,707 --> 00:37:20,700
I don't smell any alcohol.

451
00:37:20,545 --> 00:37:24,538
...no fever.

452
00:37:24,482 --> 00:37:29,353
What's wrong?

453
00:37:29,353 --> 00:37:33,346
My father has been appointed
as a minister in Seoul.

454
00:37:40,531 --> 00:37:46,504
What great news.

455
00:37:46,504 --> 00:37:53,277
That's a high rank in the government.

456
00:37:53,277 --> 00:38:02,286
But why aren't you happy?

457
00:38:02,286 --> 00:38:06,279
I have to leave for Seoul tomorrow.

458
00:38:34,986 --> 00:38:42,793
Are you worried I won't follow you?

459
00:38:42,793 --> 00:38:46,786
A woman follows
her husband wherever he goes.

460
00:38:48,466 --> 00:38:50,801
There's nothing
in Namwon if you're away.

461
00:38:50,801 --> 00:38:54,794
My mother said if people
discover our marriage,

462
00:38:57,375 --> 00:39:01,368
I'll be disowned,
and forbidden to take the state exam.

463
00:38:59,543 --> 00:39:03,536
So she insists I don't mention
our marriage to my father.

464
00:39:03,014 --> 00:39:06,651
Are you saying we must separate?

465
00:39:06,651 --> 00:39:10,554
Only for a little while.

466
00:39:10,554 --> 00:39:14,547
All I can do is come back for you later.

467
00:39:15,626 --> 00:39:19,619
Oh my husband!

468
00:39:22,466 --> 00:39:26,459
Is what you said

469
00:39:25,803 --> 00:39:29,796
a quirk, a joke,

470
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:32,732
a mistake, or nonsense?

471
00:39:31,442 --> 00:39:35,435
Watching me kill myself...

472
00:39:38,316 --> 00:39:42,309
Is that what you want?

473
00:39:42,853 --> 00:39:46,846
When we met the first time,

474
00:40:09,347 --> 00:40:11,649
what did you say?

475
00:40:11,649 --> 00:40:15,642
We swore to the
mountains and the ocean

476
00:40:12,717 --> 00:40:16,710
with the sun and the moon
as our witnesses...

477
00:40:14,819 --> 00:40:18,812
Until the mulberry field
becomes the sea

478
00:40:19,323 --> 00:40:23,316
or the sea becomes the mulberry field,

479
00:40:20,658 --> 00:40:24,651
we will never part.

480
00:40:22,827 --> 00:40:26,820
Not even a year has past,

481
00:40:23,894 --> 00:40:27,887
and you're saying farewell?

482
00:40:26,063 --> 00:40:30,056
There is the cloud you swore on.

483
00:40:29,133 --> 00:40:33,804
Speak to me.

484
00:40:33,804 --> 00:40:37,797
Speak to me.

485
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:41,645
You begged me

486
00:40:41,645 --> 00:40:45,638
to be your wife,

487
00:40:45,716 --> 00:40:49,709
but now you ruined my life!

488
00:40:49,954 --> 00:40:53,724
My husband, take this drink.

489
00:40:53,724 --> 00:40:55,626
While you travel to Seoul,

490
00:40:55,626 --> 00:40:59,619
think of my love for you
when you see the blue river.

491
00:40:57,895 --> 00:41:23,187
Our enemy is not a person,

492
00:41:23,187 --> 00:41:27,180
the enemy is the class that divides us.

493
00:41:26,424 --> 00:41:30,417
Chunhyang, take this mirror.

494
00:41:30,861 --> 00:41:35,699
My love is as pure as
the mirror's reflection.

495
00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:39,692
Cherish it and think
of me when you use it.

496
00:41:39,437 --> 00:41:42,173
Take this, my husband.

497
00:41:42,173 --> 00:41:46,166
My unchangeable love is the
same as the color of jade.

498
00:41:44,508 --> 00:41:48,501
Think of me when you see it.

499
00:41:45,776 --> 00:41:48,879
After Namwon,
there's Osu and lmsil,

500
00:41:48,879 --> 00:41:50,781
and then Chunju
which is famous for its fans.

501
00:41:50,781 --> 00:41:51,816
After Yusan, which is known
for its fur and leather,

502
00:41:51,816 --> 00:41:54,185
there's fine honey
and ginseng in Kongju.

503
00:41:54,185 --> 00:41:58,178
Then there's Chunan,
which is famous for its carps.

504
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:00,413
Then Suwon and Kwachon,
which is 32 km from Seoul.

505
00:41:57,088 --> 00:42:03,060
Bandits in Seoul are so territorial,

506
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:07,053
country people start to shiver
when they pass Kwachon.

507
00:42:06,931 --> 00:42:15,139
Chunhyang...

508
00:42:15,139 --> 00:42:19,132
When I pass the exam,
I'll send a royal palanquin for you.

509
00:42:27,952 --> 00:42:32,056
So wait until that day.

510
00:42:32,056 --> 00:42:36,049
A royal palanquin is only ridden
by high-ranking officials.

511
00:42:54,745 --> 00:42:58,738
Do you think this day will come
before I become an old hag?

512
00:43:01,552 --> 00:43:05,545
Meanwhile,
his mother prepares to leave.

513
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:09,527
Double palanquins...

514
00:43:09,527 --> 00:43:11,495
Single palanquins...

515
00:43:11,495 --> 00:43:17,735
Horses and soldiers are busy.

516
00:43:17,735 --> 00:43:20,571
Nervous Pangja
dashes with Mongryong's horse.

517
00:43:20,571 --> 00:43:23,574
Ring...ring...ring...ring...

518
00:43:23,574 --> 00:43:28,045
He arrives at Chunhyang's home.

519
00:43:28,045 --> 00:43:29,880
Master Lee there's big trouble!

520
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:35,786
Master Lee! Master Lee!
There's big trouble!

521
00:43:35,786 --> 00:43:39,779
Your mother asked about you,
and I gave her an excuse.

522
00:43:37,121 --> 00:43:41,114
We must hurry.

523
00:43:45,563 --> 00:43:49,556
Mongryong has no choice,

524
00:43:49,767 --> 00:43:53,760
but to mount the horse's back.

525
00:44:16,927 --> 00:44:20,920
Farewell Chunhyang.

526
00:44:21,832 --> 00:44:25,825
Farewell mother-in-law.

527
00:44:25,135 --> 00:44:29,128
Farewell Hyangdan.

528
00:44:30,641 --> 00:44:34,812
Chunhyang is speechless.

529
00:44:34,812 --> 00:44:38,916
On barefoot, runs, runs, runs...

530
00:44:38,916 --> 00:44:42,909
...she grabs the bridle with one hand,

531
00:44:43,854 --> 00:44:47,925
and with the other,

532
00:44:47,925 --> 00:44:51,918
she grabs Mongryong's leg.

533
00:45:01,939 --> 00:45:05,932
Oh my husband!

534
00:45:04,174 --> 00:45:08,167
Oh my husband, please take me!

535
00:45:08,045 --> 00:45:11,615
Pangja pulls the bridle,

536
00:45:11,615 --> 00:45:16,420
and whips the horse.

537
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:19,423
It bolts like a flying tiger.

538
00:45:19,423 --> 00:45:27,364
Green mountains and blue rivers

539
00:45:27,364 --> 00:45:33,937
he passes it one by one.

540
00:45:33,937 --> 00:45:35,873
Like the mandarin duck

541
00:45:35,873 --> 00:45:40,277
that lost her lover,

542
00:45:40,277 --> 00:45:43,947
Chunhyang is heart-broken.

543
00:45:43,947 --> 00:45:47,940
As she sees her husband leave,

544
00:45:47,351 --> 00:45:56,460
she sees this much of him

545
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,329
and that much of him,

546
00:45:58,329 --> 00:46:01,465
like a distant moon,

547
00:46:01,465 --> 00:46:07,971
like a distant star,

548
00:46:07,971 --> 00:46:11,964
and then like a butterfly...

549
00:46:14,978 --> 00:46:18,971
I long to go.

550
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:23,743
I long to go.

551
00:46:26,256 --> 00:46:31,328
I long to follow

552
00:46:31,328 --> 00:46:35,321
my lover,

553
00:46:36,266 --> 00:46:40,259
for one thousand miles,

554
00:46:39,703 --> 00:46:43,696
for even ten thousand miles.

555
00:46:43,006 --> 00:46:46,999
Where the wind rests,

556
00:46:45,976 --> 00:46:49,969
where the clouds rest,

557
00:46:49,113 --> 00:46:53,106
where all animals rest,

558
00:46:52,216 --> 00:46:56,209
even a wild falcon,

559
00:46:55,285 --> 00:46:59,278
where they all rest

560
00:46:58,155 --> 00:47:02,148
at Dongsul's high ridge.

561
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:03,983
But I will cross it over
to follow my love.

562
00:47:02,326 --> 00:47:06,319
The Jiknya star in the heavens,

563
00:47:05,162 --> 00:47:09,155
even when the Milky Way blocks it,

564
00:47:11,068 --> 00:47:15,061
the Gyunwoo star

565
00:47:14,238 --> 00:47:18,231
can always see it once a year.

566
00:47:17,341 --> 00:47:21,334
The place where my beloved stays,

567
00:47:23,147 --> 00:47:27,140
what Milky Way is blocking him,

568
00:47:26,083 --> 00:47:30,076
that makes me see him no more?

569
00:47:42,766 --> 00:47:47,438
I want to die,

570
00:47:47,438 --> 00:47:51,431
and become a spring swallow,

571
00:47:51,475 --> 00:47:55,468
so I can fly above my beloved's roof

572
00:47:57,047 --> 00:48:01,040
and build my nest under the eaves.

573
00:48:01,318 --> 00:48:05,311
I'll meet him
in the middle of the night,

574
00:48:06,356 --> 00:48:10,349
and make love to him till dawn.

575
00:48:10,294 --> 00:48:14,287
their hats are pulled up and...

576
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:17,323
they arrive in the forest and...

577
00:48:20,537 --> 00:48:24,530
Chunhyang! Come out

578
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,809
Madam, two soldiers
are looking for Chunhyang.

579
00:48:25,809 --> 00:48:29,802
Oh no, I forgot about the
courtesan roll call...

580
00:48:31,548 --> 00:48:33,350
Welcome. Please, come in.

581
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:41,258
It's been a long time.

582
00:48:41,258 --> 00:48:43,193
The new governor
demands to see Chunhyang.

583
00:48:43,193 --> 00:48:47,186
Since I haven't kept
my promise to buy you a drink,

584
00:48:47,364 --> 00:48:51,435
were you disappointed?

585
00:48:51,435 --> 00:48:56,840
It would be a lie if I wasn't.

586
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:00,833
- I'm sorry I was so busy...
- Chunhyang, come out!

587
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:04,103
We're good friends so
don't let it get to you, okay?

588
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:17,895
Please have a drink later.

589
00:49:17,895 --> 00:49:21,431
- Stop it.
- Take it. Don't worry.

590
00:49:21,431 --> 00:49:25,424
- Stop it.
- Stop it.

591
00:49:26,336 --> 00:49:30,329
Hey Kim! We scored.

592
00:49:41,351 --> 00:49:57,534
Chunhyang.

593
00:49:57,534 --> 00:49:59,369
When the new governor headed
west Pyongyang for two years,

594
00:49:59,369 --> 00:50:03,362
he awarded
his courtesans a lot of money.

595
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,162
Also, as the Governor of Unsan

596
00:50:25,162 --> 00:50:29,155
he gave his courtesans much more.

597
00:50:28,699 --> 00:50:42,479
So be nice to him, okay?

598
00:50:42,479 --> 00:50:45,749
Chunhyang.

599
00:50:45,749 --> 00:50:50,354
We'll take care of
you so don't worry and come with us.

600
00:50:50,354 --> 00:50:54,347
Look after her, okay?

601
00:50:56,226 --> 00:51:00,219
Chunhyang has arrived!

602
00:51:01,465 --> 00:51:05,458
Chunhyang is here, my lord.

603
00:51:02,766 --> 00:51:05,369
You're very pretty.
Yes, indeed.

604
00:51:05,369 --> 00:51:09,362
I chose Namwon
among many other places

605
00:51:08,238 --> 00:51:11,575
to see you for myself.

606
00:51:11,575 --> 00:51:13,510
But...

607
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:17,503
Are you really married
to the old governor's son?

608
00:51:25,355 --> 00:51:28,258
Yes, I am.

609
00:51:28,258 --> 00:51:31,495
But how can
a young woman like you be alone?

610
00:51:31,495 --> 00:51:35,488
You must have
another man who cares for you?

611
00:51:34,765 --> 00:51:38,035
Please tell me.

612
00:51:38,035 --> 00:51:42,028
Because I'm married
to the old governor's son,

613
00:51:41,538 --> 00:51:45,531
I'm devoted to
no other man except for my husband.

614
00:51:44,775 --> 00:51:51,448
You're well intended.

615
00:51:51,448 --> 00:51:53,784
But he'll probably marry
a noble girl when he passes the exam.

616
00:51:53,784 --> 00:51:57,777
And he'll forget all about you.

617
00:51:57,587 --> 00:52:00,757
You will serve me from now on.

618
00:52:00,757 --> 00:52:04,061
So go clean
yourself up and wait for me.

619
00:52:04,061 --> 00:52:08,054
I'm not listed as a courtesan,
and lived my life as a fair lady.

620
00:52:07,497 --> 00:52:11,490
That gives you
no reason to do as you please.

621
00:52:10,767 --> 00:52:14,371
By law and custom,

622
00:52:14,371 --> 00:52:17,507
it's natural to serve
your new governor.

623
00:52:17,507 --> 00:52:21,445
Stop your nonsense
and get ready for him.

624
00:52:21,445 --> 00:52:24,448
If my husband never returns,

625
00:52:24,448 --> 00:52:30,821
I'll be chaste until I die.

626
00:52:30,821 --> 00:52:33,356
So please reconsider.

627
00:52:33,356 --> 00:52:39,863
A chaste courtesan's
daughter is ridiculous.

628
00:52:39,863 --> 00:52:43,100
My mother would faint if she heard this.

629
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:47,093
Be it your mother or I,
fidelity is the same.

630
00:52:47,437 --> 00:52:49,740
But does class make us different?

631
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:53,744
What?

632
00:52:53,744 --> 00:52:57,737
A governor is loyal to one king.
A wife is loyal to one husband.

633
00:52:55,612 --> 00:53:05,655
But would you fall on your knees,

634
00:53:05,655 --> 00:53:10,427
and serve two kings, governor?

635
00:53:10,427 --> 00:53:13,797
How dare you!

636
00:53:13,797 --> 00:53:17,501
You will die for that!

637
00:53:17,501 --> 00:53:21,494
Drag her outside!

638
00:53:21,304 --> 00:53:25,297
We've got her outside my lord!

639
00:53:24,641 --> 00:53:28,634
If your mother is a courtesan,
then you're a courtesan by law.

640
00:53:31,615 --> 00:53:35,608
As a lowly courtesan,
you disobeyed my orders.

641
00:53:35,318 --> 00:53:38,789
So you deserve to die!

642
00:53:38,789 --> 00:53:45,695
Did I steal food?

643
00:53:45,695 --> 00:53:49,466
Did I disobey my mother,
or cheat my fellow brethren?

644
00:53:49,466 --> 00:53:52,803
If not,
then why are you punishing me?

645
00:53:52,803 --> 00:53:56,796
You must be ignorant of our laws.

646
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:03,446
Then tell me what law I've broken.

647
00:54:03,446 --> 00:54:06,783
Chief Penal Official!

648
00:54:06,783 --> 00:54:10,153
Yes, sir.

649
00:54:10,153 --> 00:54:13,690
Tell her every sin she's committed.

650
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:20,730
Yes, sir.

651
00:54:20,730 --> 00:00:00,080
Listen carefully.

652
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,073
One who commits high treason,
or disobeys the governor

653
00:00:05,085 --> 00:00:09,078
is punishable by death.

654
00:00:11,091 --> 00:00:16,096
Then what does it say about

655
00:00:16,096 --> 00:00:20,100
raping a married woman?

656
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:26,106
She's the wicked daughter of the devil!

657
00:00:26,106 --> 00:00:30,099
Make her confess her crimes in writing!

658
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:33,102
Chunhyang, write as I say.

659
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:35,115
As a lowly courtesan,
I disobeyed the governor,

660
00:00:35,115 --> 00:00:39,108
so I deserve to die for my crime.

661
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,113
"One Love"

662
00:00:43,123 --> 00:00:46,126
Chief Executioner!

663
00:00:46,126 --> 00:00:51,131
Yes, sir.

664
00:00:51,131 --> 00:00:58,138
Beat her till her organs burst!

665
00:00:58,138 --> 00:01:01,141
If you don't,
you'll be the one to die!

666
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:05,145
Yes, sir.

667
00:01:05,145 --> 00:01:09,138
Look at the way

668
00:01:08,148 --> 00:01:12,141
the soldier is walking.

669
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:23,152
He lifts an armful and brings the clubs.

670
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,153
He throws them to the floor...

671
00:01:23,163 --> 00:01:27,156
He sorts through the stack.

672
00:01:28,168 --> 00:01:32,161
He grabs one and tests it.

673
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:35,164
He grabs another and tests it.

674
00:01:35,175 --> 00:01:39,168
He picks a large one with a good grip.

675
00:01:38,178 --> 00:01:39,179
Move an inch!

676
00:01:39,179 --> 00:01:43,183
and your bones will be broken!

677
00:01:43,183 --> 00:01:47,176
Beat her hard!

678
00:02:06,206 --> 00:02:10,199
Chunhyang's mind
and body is scorching with pain,

679
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:29,195
but she never shows it.

680
00:02:29,195 --> 00:02:32,198
She moves her head in a
shape of a 'one',

681
00:02:32,198 --> 00:02:37,203
stares into Hakdo's eyes
and cries out...

682
00:02:37,203 --> 00:02:41,196
One and only one!

683
00:02:40,206 --> 00:02:44,199
My love is only for one man!

684
00:02:41,207 --> 00:02:45,200
So why are you doing this to me!

685
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:49,204
Just kill me!

686
00:02:47,213 --> 00:02:51,206
Hit her harder!

687
00:02:50,216 --> 00:02:54,209
Yes sir!

688
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,213
Two can never be!

689
00:02:58,224 --> 00:03:02,217
What's the difference

690
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:07,222
between loyalty to a husband,
and a minister's to a king?

691
00:03:10,236 --> 00:03:14,229
I know a woman's duty,

692
00:03:12,238 --> 00:03:16,231
so how can I serve two men?

693
00:03:16,242 --> 00:03:20,235
This is impossible
so I can't accept two!

694
00:03:20,246 --> 00:03:24,239
After the third hit...

695
00:03:23,249 --> 00:03:27,242
In our three lives,
in my three obligations,

696
00:03:26,252 --> 00:03:30,245
I'm loyal to my father,
my husband, and my son!

697
00:03:32,258 --> 00:03:36,251
I'm not a whore!

698
00:03:37,263 --> 00:03:41,256
So just kill me!

699
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:44,259
After the fourth hit...

700
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:48,263
A noble governor like you,

701
00:03:48,274 --> 00:03:52,267
do you not know any justice?

702
00:03:51,277 --> 00:03:55,270
Even if you tear me into four pieces,

703
00:03:55,281 --> 00:03:59,274
and hang them on the four gates,

704
00:03:57,283 --> 00:04:01,276
I still won't accept you!

705
00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:05,280
After the fifth hit...

706
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,283
You rode with five horses.

707
00:04:09,295 --> 00:04:13,288
So keep this country's five ethics!

708
00:04:11,297 --> 00:04:15,290
After the sixth hit...

709
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:17,292
I have six organs,

710
00:04:17,303 --> 00:04:21,296
and my love is in each one of them.

711
00:04:20,306 --> 00:04:24,299
So it's useless
for you to tear them apart!

712
00:04:22,308 --> 00:04:26,301
After the seventh hit...

713
00:04:23,309 --> 00:04:27,302
If you raised a seven-foot sword,

714
00:04:25,311 --> 00:04:29,304
and cut off my head like a horse,

715
00:04:40,326 --> 00:04:44,319
it's no use!

716
00:04:51,337 --> 00:04:55,330
After the eighth hit...

717
00:04:55,341 --> 00:04:59,334
Try as many as eight hundred times,

718
00:05:00,346 --> 00:05:04,339
but my love will never change!

719
00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:07,342
After the ninth hit...

720
00:05:06,352 --> 00:05:10,345
You're the King's official!

721
00:05:09,355 --> 00:05:13,348
So stop your corruptive ways!

722
00:05:12,358 --> 00:05:16,351
My intestine has nine curves.

723
00:05:16,362 --> 00:05:20,355
My love flows deep in them!

724
00:05:20,366 --> 00:05:24,359
After the tenth hit...

725
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:25,360
Ten cries for my love!

726
00:05:22,368 --> 00:05:26,361
Move away!

727
00:05:25,371 --> 00:05:29,364
You bastards! Let me in!

728
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:33,368
My daughter's dying!

729
00:05:30,376 --> 00:05:34,369
My daughter!
Why did this happen to you?

730
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:39,374
Is beating innocent people
the new governor's way to rule?

731
00:05:40,386 --> 00:05:42,388
Is being loyal
to your husband a punishable sin?

732
00:05:42,388 --> 00:05:46,392
If she dies,
then kill me also!

733
00:05:46,392 --> 00:05:48,394
Please save my daughter!

734
00:05:48,394 --> 00:06:03,409
Move away!

735
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:07,413
She'll die like this.

736
00:06:07,413 --> 00:06:20,426
She needs medicine.

737
00:06:20,426 --> 00:06:30,436
Pangja, let her down here.

738
00:06:30,436 --> 00:06:34,429
Oh, Chunhyang...

739
00:06:31,437 --> 00:06:32,438
Oh, my daughter...

740
00:06:32,438 --> 00:06:36,431
Bring some water!

741
00:06:35,441 --> 00:06:39,445
Chunhyang wake up.

742
00:06:39,445 --> 00:06:43,438
Chunhyang wake up.

743
00:06:42,448 --> 00:06:46,452
She's crazy.

744
00:06:46,452 --> 00:06:51,457
Is she doing this out of some
spite against Chunhyang?

745
00:06:51,457 --> 00:06:55,450
What is she doing?

746
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:05,460
In Chinju, a courtesan
named Uiam died for her country.

747
00:07:06,472 --> 00:07:10,465
In Pyongyang, a courtesan
named Wolson killed an enemy general.

748
00:07:11,477 --> 00:07:15,470
The people in Andong
worships the shrine of lljinhong,

749
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:19,474
who fed her husband with
her flesh to save him.

750
00:07:20,486 --> 00:07:24,479
In Chungju, they honor
Hwawol for saving the king,

751
00:07:26,492 --> 00:07:30,485
and now in Namwon
a new courtesan Chunhyang

752
00:07:28,494 --> 00:07:32,487
will be next to honor...

753
00:07:31,497 --> 00:07:42,508
Meanwhile in Seoul,

754
00:07:42,508 --> 00:07:48,514
Young Lee studies hard.

755
00:07:48,514 --> 00:07:52,507
He reads night and day

756
00:07:51,517 --> 00:07:54,520
countless pages of Korean classics.

757
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,513
His knowledge broadens
and he becomes a skillful writer.

758
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:03,529
The state exam takes place
while the country stood silent.

759
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:07,522
The Royal Teacher
comes forth with a scroll in his hand.

760
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:20,535
His assistant takes
the scroll and hangs the question.

761
00:08:20,546 --> 00:08:24,539
"The past spring of
this garden is the same as the present."

762
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:29,544
The question hangs tall.

763
00:08:31,557 --> 00:08:37,563
Mongryong reads the board,

764
00:08:37,563 --> 00:08:42,568
He thinks for a moment.

765
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:46,561
He grinds the stick into the
ink stone, and dips his brush.

766
00:08:48,574 --> 00:08:52,567
His brush strokes are equal
to famous calligraphers.

767
00:08:54,580 --> 00:09:00,586
He's the first to complete
and hand in his answer.

768
00:09:00,586 --> 00:09:04,579
The Royal Instructor
looks at it and compliments him.

769
00:09:05,591 --> 00:09:09,584
Your words are perfect
and have spirits in them.

770
00:09:12,598 --> 00:09:16,602
Each character
is as genuine as a jewel.

771
00:09:16,602 --> 00:09:22,608
They post the top score.

772
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:26,601
Mongryong Lee!

773
00:09:28,614 --> 00:09:32,607
Mongryong Lee!

774
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,613
The crowd is amazed
by the announcement.

775
00:09:40,626 --> 00:09:45,631
Handsome Lee walks proudly
towards the court terrace.

776
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:49,624
After he wears his formal gown,

777
00:09:51,637 --> 00:09:57,643
He receives a token
and is escorted to the King.

778
00:09:57,643 --> 00:10:03,649
He kneels before the King,

779
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:09,655
and graciously accepts
his three cups of wine.

780
00:10:09,655 --> 00:10:15,661
He bows to the King,

781
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:21,667
and walks down the steps,

782
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:27,673
wearing a flower cap and blue gown,

783
00:10:27,673 --> 00:10:31,666
with a jade emblem
and red scroll in his hands.

784
00:10:32,678 --> 00:10:38,684
After he became the ethics official,

785
00:10:38,684 --> 00:10:44,690
the King secretly makes him

786
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:48,683
his emissary to inspect Cholla Province

787
00:10:49,695 --> 00:10:56,702
and gives him his assignment,

788
00:10:56,702 --> 00:11:00,695
with a symbolic ruler and royal insignia.

789
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:06,701
He bids his family farewell
and leaves for Cholla Province.

790
00:11:08,714 --> 00:11:14,720
He leaves the South Gate of Seoul,

791
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,713
and crosses Han River
and several streams.

792
00:11:20,726 --> 00:11:25,731
Then he passes
many small villages like

793
00:11:25,731 --> 00:11:29,724
Mirookdangee,
Kolsagunae, and Ssangyoochon,

794
00:11:31,737 --> 00:11:35,730
and many marketplaces,
like Dukjum and Ohmu

795
00:11:36,742 --> 00:11:40,735
and many towns like Sosa,
Kwangjung, and Morowon,

796
00:11:41,747 --> 00:11:48,754
He finally arrives at

797
00:11:48,754 --> 00:11:52,747
Yusan town.

798
00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:00,766
- First Deputy.
- Yes, sir.

799
00:12:00,766 --> 00:12:06,772
Go to the west provinces.
Start in Yusan and lksan.

800
00:12:06,772 --> 00:12:11,777
Then Kimjae and the rest.

801
00:12:11,777 --> 00:12:16,782
We'll meet at Kwangharu
on the 15th of next month.

802
00:12:16,782 --> 00:12:20,786
Yes, sir.

803
00:12:20,786 --> 00:12:25,791
- Second Deputy.
-Yes, sir.

804
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:31,797
Go to the east and
check Kosan, Kumsan,

805
00:12:31,797 --> 00:12:37,803
Muju, Yongdam, and the rest.

806
00:12:37,803 --> 00:12:41,796
- Meet on the same day too.
- Yes, sir.

807
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:47,802
Hey, you dear farmers,
listen to what I say.

808
00:12:45,811 --> 00:12:49,804
Listen to what I say.

809
00:12:46,812 --> 00:12:50,805
Drop by drop,
your sweat turns into fruit.

810
00:12:48,814 --> 00:12:52,807
Chop by chop,
your grain turns into gold.

811
00:12:49,815 --> 00:12:52,818
Come here. Eat with us.

812
00:12:52,818 --> 00:12:55,821
No thank you.

813
00:12:55,821 --> 00:12:59,825
I'm just a vagabond

814
00:12:59,825 --> 00:13:03,818
headed to Namwon
to ask a favor from a friend.

815
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,833
So how is this town now?

816
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:11,837
- The town is full of demons.
What do you mean?

817
00:13:11,837 --> 00:13:15,830
The governor is a drunken devil,
his confidant is an old zombie,

818
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,833
the chiefs are gambling trolls,
and we're all grumbling ghosts.

819
00:13:23,849 --> 00:13:25,851
- This town seems to be cursed.
Do you think that's all?

820
00:13:25,851 --> 00:13:28,854
For the governor's birthday,

821
00:13:28,854 --> 00:13:32,847
each family
has to give three sacks of rice.

822
00:13:33,859 --> 00:13:37,863
He's robbing the people.

823
00:13:37,863 --> 00:13:41,856
I've heard the governor
adores a courtesan named Chunhyang,

824
00:13:43,869 --> 00:13:47,873
and enjoys her every night.
Is this true?

825
00:13:47,873 --> 00:13:54,847
What?

826
00:13:54,847 --> 00:14:04,857
You bastard!

827
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:08,850
How dare you insult her!

828
00:14:10,863 --> 00:14:14,856
It's just what I've heard!
Why are you angry?

829
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:22,875
Who the hell told you that?

830
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,878
I'll rip his eyes out!

831
00:14:25,878 --> 00:14:29,882
And tear his ears off!

832
00:14:29,882 --> 00:14:31,884
Catch him! Get him!

833
00:14:31,884 --> 00:14:35,877
How much farther?
How far to Seoul?

834
00:14:33,886 --> 00:14:37,879
Where do I sleep today?

835
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:40,882
Where do I sleep tomorrow?

836
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:44,886
My fate is unlucky,
so I have to go.

837
00:14:45,898 --> 00:14:49,891
But Chunhyang's fate is worse.

838
00:14:49,902 --> 00:14:53,895
How much farther, how far?

839
00:14:59,912 --> 00:15:04,917
Hey you, come here.

840
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:09,922
- Come here.
-Why do you call me?

841
00:15:09,922 --> 00:15:11,924
I'm a busy person, you know.

842
00:15:11,924 --> 00:15:15,928
- Because I'm from Seoul.
- From Seoul?

843
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:19,932
Who are you visiting
at such a far place?

844
00:15:19,932 --> 00:15:23,925
I'm delivering Chunhyang Sung's
letter to Mongryong Lee.

845
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:27,940
- Let me see the letter.
- Are you serious?

846
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,945
Reading a man's letter is forbidden,

847
00:15:32,945 --> 00:15:35,948
but you ask to see
a woman's letter in public?

848
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:39,941
You don't recognize me?

849
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:42,944
Look carefully.

850
00:15:44,957 --> 00:15:48,950
I can't believe this!
Oh, Master Lee!

851
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:56,958
It's a blessing to see you.

852
00:15:56,969 --> 00:16:00,973
Are you and the family well?

853
00:16:00,973 --> 00:16:05,978
Why are you dressed like this?

854
00:16:05,978 --> 00:16:08,981
Pangja, give me the letter.

855
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:12,974
"To Mongryong Lee of Seoul"

856
00:16:11,984 --> 00:16:15,988
After you left,

857
00:16:15,988 --> 00:16:17,990
three years have past

858
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,992
and I've yet to hear from you.

859
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:23,985
Are you too intoxicated by
Seoul's beautiful spring petals?

860
00:16:23,996 --> 00:16:27,989
Or is your mind taken away
by pretty brothel women?

861
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,004
Or are you going to marry
some noble lady in Seoul?

862
00:16:32,004 --> 00:16:34,006
I'm living with
these worries day and night.

863
00:16:34,006 --> 00:16:37,999
After the new governor arrived,
he asked me to court him,

864
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:44,016
but I defied him
and he beat me severely.

865
00:16:44,016 --> 00:16:48,020
I will die soon

866
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:54,026
at the governor's birthday feast

867
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:58,019
when he beats me on the death chair.

868
00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:02,034
Vicious bastard!

869
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:06,027
When I get hold of him...!

870
00:17:04,036 --> 00:17:09,041
Why do I feel such a fierce wind?

871
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:14,046
Could it be a fierce wind
to save poor Chunhyang?

872
00:17:14,046 --> 00:17:18,039
My master can't really
be a beggar, so could he be...

873
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:23,044
- ...an...an emissary?
- Pangja! Don't be foolish!

874
00:17:21,053 --> 00:17:41,073
Well, it's good we met.

875
00:17:41,073 --> 00:17:45,066
I want you to deliver a letter
to my home in Seoul.

876
00:17:43,075 --> 00:17:47,068
When the sun is about to set,

877
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:51,072
he arrives in front of Chunhyang's home.

878
00:17:50,082 --> 00:17:54,075
In the back of the garden,
is a silent cry.

879
00:17:53,085 --> 00:17:57,078
He's drawn to the sound

880
00:17:54,086 --> 00:17:58,079
to take a closer look.

881
00:17:56,088 --> 00:18:00,081
He sees Chunhyang's mother

882
00:17:59,091 --> 00:18:03,084
at a small altar in the backyard.

883
00:18:02,094 --> 00:18:06,087
To the Great Dipper,

884
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:22,103
with lit candles

885
00:18:24,116 --> 00:18:28,109
and a bowl of clean water

886
00:18:30,122 --> 00:18:34,115
set in front of her, she prays...

887
00:18:40,132 --> 00:18:44,125
I pray...I pray...

888
00:19:12,164 --> 00:19:16,157
...to the gods of heaven and earth,

889
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:18,159
and the gods of the sun,
moon, and stars...

890
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:22,163
Please come and help me.

891
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:23,164
Please make my son-in-law

892
00:19:23,175 --> 00:19:26,178
a royal emissary

893
00:19:26,178 --> 00:19:30,171
or a lord of Cholla Province.

894
00:19:29,181 --> 00:19:33,174
Either one will be fine.

895
00:19:34,186 --> 00:19:38,179
Please let him
save my daughter's life.

896
00:19:39,191 --> 00:19:43,195
I passed the test...

897
00:19:43,195 --> 00:19:47,188
But I owe it mostly to their prayers.

898
00:19:44,196 --> 00:19:48,200
Is anyone home?

899
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,204
Come out!

900
00:19:52,204 --> 00:19:56,197
Come out!

901
00:19:57,209 --> 00:20:01,213
May I help you?

902
00:20:01,213 --> 00:20:05,206
Go and tell your madam to come out.

903
00:20:02,214 --> 00:20:03,215
Who is it?

904
00:20:03,215 --> 00:20:07,219
Someone is asking for you madam.

905
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:11,223
He looks like a beggar asking for food.

906
00:20:11,223 --> 00:20:15,227
What?

907
00:20:15,227 --> 00:20:18,230
Are you deaf?

908
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,233
Haven't you heard?

909
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:25,226
My daughter is in jail and about to die,

910
00:20:23,235 --> 00:20:31,243
and you ask us for food?

911
00:20:31,243 --> 00:20:35,247
We have none! Get out of here!

912
00:20:35,247 --> 00:20:42,254
I've arrived!

913
00:20:42,254 --> 00:20:46,258
It's Mongryong Lee from Seoul!

914
00:20:46,258 --> 00:20:53,265
How can this be?

915
00:20:53,265 --> 00:21:00,272
Is this true, or is it a joke?

916
00:21:00,272 --> 00:21:03,275
Hyangdan. Bring the lantern.

917
00:21:03,275 --> 00:21:06,278
Is my son-in-law really here?

918
00:21:06,278 --> 00:21:10,271
What took you so long?

919
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:13,274
Let me see my son-in-law.

920
00:21:12,284 --> 00:21:16,277
This can't be...

921
00:21:16,288 --> 00:21:20,281
The son of the ex-governor.

922
00:21:23,295 --> 00:21:27,288
Look at the way he's dressed!

923
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:29,301
Chunhyang's dead...

924
00:21:29,301 --> 00:21:33,305
She's dead for certain.

925
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:37,309
I prayed day and
night you'd return as a high official,

926
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:42,314
but you come back
as this country's filthiest beggar!

927
00:21:42,314 --> 00:21:46,307
A crisis struck our family,
so I couldn't take the exam.

928
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:53,325
Our wealth is all gone, and
I've been begging since then.

929
00:21:53,325 --> 00:21:57,318
To remember old times,
I came back to Namwon.

930
00:21:55,327 --> 00:21:58,330
That was delicious!

931
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,333
Must be your job to stuff your face.

932
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:10,342
Your appetite reflects your living.

933
00:22:10,342 --> 00:22:13,345
I was so hungry
before I could barely think.

934
00:22:13,345 --> 00:22:17,338
But since I'm full now,
Chunhyang comes to mind.

935
00:22:16,348 --> 00:22:20,352
- Bring me to Chunhyang.
- Chunhyang's dead!

936
00:22:20,352 --> 00:22:25,357
Let's go.

937
00:22:25,357 --> 00:22:30,362
She's dying because
of me so can't I see her? Let's go.

938
00:22:30,362 --> 00:22:34,366
You can't go now.

939
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:38,359
The governor is so strict
no man can bring food to her.

940
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:44,376
Even a male dog can't go there.

941
00:22:44,376 --> 00:22:47,379
If they catch you,
you'll be killed.

942
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:51,372
When the last bell strikes,
you can see her then.

943
00:22:49,381 --> 00:22:53,374
Oh, my poor baby...

944
00:22:53,385 --> 00:22:57,378
The first bell, the second,

945
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:02,383
the third, fourth,
and fifth bell strikes.

946
00:23:00,392 --> 00:23:04,385
The time has come.

947
00:23:10,402 --> 00:23:14,395
Hyangdan leads the way.

948
00:23:13,405 --> 00:23:17,398
and the beggar son-in-law follows them

949
00:23:17,409 --> 00:23:21,402
to Chunhyang's decrepit cell.

950
00:23:21,413 --> 00:23:25,406
The night is dark and gloomy,

951
00:23:26,418 --> 00:23:30,411
not a person in sight,

952
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:32,413
the echoes of a warbling bird...

953
00:23:33,425 --> 00:23:37,418
running water...

954
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:45,426
wailing ghosts...

955
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,433
the wind blows...

956
00:24:03,455 --> 00:24:07,448
...like trembling ground.

957
00:24:19,471 --> 00:24:23,464
Heavy rain is falling...

958
00:24:36,488 --> 00:24:40,481
Ghosts in twos and threes

959
00:24:44,496 --> 00:24:48,489
come together and cry...

960
00:24:52,504 --> 00:25:00,512
Guard.

961
00:25:00,512 --> 00:25:09,521
Guard.

962
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:13,514
Damn guards are busy gambling again.

963
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:26,538
...Nine.

964
00:25:26,538 --> 00:25:34,513
- Three pairs.
- Damn it! It's not my day.

965
00:25:34,513 --> 00:25:43,522
Prison keeper.

966
00:25:43,522 --> 00:25:47,515
Who is it?

967
00:25:53,532 --> 00:26:01,540
It's you again.

968
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:09,548
We can't let anyone in until the
governor's birthday tomorrow.

969
00:26:09,548 --> 00:26:12,551
Go back.

970
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:16,544
Don't be stubborn.
Take this, okay?

971
00:26:18,557 --> 00:26:26,565
Hey Dukbae!

972
00:26:26,565 --> 00:26:30,558
Hey Dukbae!

973
00:26:35,574 --> 00:26:39,567
Open the gate idiot!

974
00:26:37,576 --> 00:26:41,569
It's some food for my baby.
Give her this later.

975
00:26:46,585 --> 00:26:48,587
Anything else inside?

976
00:26:48,587 --> 00:26:52,580
- Oh, come on...
- Go in.

977
00:26:50,589 --> 00:26:57,596
My baby...

978
00:26:57,596 --> 00:26:59,598
Chunhyang...

979
00:26:59,598 --> 00:27:03,602
Wake up. It's your mother.

980
00:27:03,602 --> 00:27:07,595
Mother,
what are you doing here this late?

981
00:27:05,604 --> 00:27:08,607
He's here...

982
00:27:08,607 --> 00:27:12,611
Who are you talking about?

983
00:27:12,611 --> 00:27:16,604
The one you've waited day and night for.

984
00:27:15,614 --> 00:27:18,617
Be it your husband or a beggar,
he's here. See for yourself.

985
00:27:18,617 --> 00:27:20,619
Is this true?

986
00:27:20,619 --> 00:27:24,612
Hyangdan, raise the lantern.

987
00:27:24,623 --> 00:27:28,616
Chunhyang, it's me.
What happened to you?

988
00:27:27,626 --> 00:27:30,629
Oh, my husband.
What took you so long?

989
00:27:30,629 --> 00:27:32,631
What happened to your face?

990
00:27:32,631 --> 00:27:36,624
He can't save you,
and you still call him your husband?

991
00:27:34,633 --> 00:27:36,635
Chunhyang.

992
00:27:36,635 --> 00:27:38,637
My husband.

993
00:27:38,637 --> 00:27:42,630
Tomorrow at the new governor's
birthday feast, I'll be executed.

994
00:27:42,641 --> 00:27:46,634
Don't let anyone touch my body.

995
00:27:44,643 --> 00:27:48,636
Take me to Seoul and bury me
in your ancestors' graveyard.

996
00:27:48,647 --> 00:27:52,640
Then prepare a simple altar for me,
and say these words...

997
00:27:56,655 --> 00:28:00,648
Chunhyang,
cherish the drink I pour for you.

998
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:04,652
If you do this,
I can rest in peace.

999
00:28:05,664 --> 00:28:09,657
Young Lee is disheartened.

1000
00:28:12,671 --> 00:28:15,674
Don't cry.
Don't cry.

1001
00:28:15,674 --> 00:28:19,678
My love Chunhyang, don't cry.

1002
00:28:19,678 --> 00:28:23,671
When the day is bright tomorrow,

1003
00:28:23,682 --> 00:28:26,685
either the death carriage
or the fortune carriage,

1004
00:28:26,685 --> 00:28:31,690
no one knows what you'll ride.

1005
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:35,683
Even when the sky collapses,

1006
00:28:34,693 --> 00:28:38,686
There is a hole to escape.

1007
00:29:12,731 --> 00:29:16,724
If I said don't cry,
then please don't cry.

1008
00:29:15,734 --> 00:29:18,737
On the next day,

1009
00:29:18,737 --> 00:29:22,730
the birthday feast takes place
in Kwangharu Pavilion.

1010
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,743
It's a spectacular sight.

1011
00:29:24,743 --> 00:29:29,748
The red pavilion stands
tall in the blue skies.

1012
00:29:29,748 --> 00:29:33,741
Surrounded by large shades like the clouds.

1013
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:35,743
Covered by silk curtains on all four sides.

1014
00:29:36,755 --> 00:29:40,759
Red and blue candle lanterns

1015
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:46,765
are hung on the open road.

1016
00:29:46,765 --> 00:29:50,758
Crowded with courtesans, musicians,
performers, and passerbies.

1017
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:52,760
Town magistrates of other counties arrive.

1018
00:29:52,771 --> 00:29:56,764
Here comes Lord of Unbong town,
the Lord of Soonchun town,

1019
00:29:57,776 --> 00:30:01,769
the old Lord of Goksung,
the handsome Lord of Soonchan,

1020
00:30:02,781 --> 00:30:11,790
the lucky Lord of Damyang,
the chic Lord of Okgwa,

1021
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:15,783
the Lord of Nampyung,
and the lazy Lord of Kwangju.

1022
00:30:22,801 --> 00:30:31,810
When all the lords enter,
another palanquin arrives.

1023
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:40,819
Firecrackers crackling.

1024
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:49,828
Sun umbrellas bumping.

1025
00:30:49,828 --> 00:30:53,832
Palanquin bearers' shoulders colliding.

1026
00:30:53,832 --> 00:30:57,825
Servants searching for their masters.

1027
00:30:58,837 --> 00:31:02,830
It's out of control.

1028
00:31:07,846 --> 00:31:11,839
Take this, take this,
take this drink,

1029
00:31:13,852 --> 00:31:17,845
and live one thousand,

1030
00:31:18,857 --> 00:31:22,850
ten thousand years.

1031
00:31:23,862 --> 00:31:27,855
Thank you for sparing your
busy time to come today.

1032
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:35,863
...Chunshim can still twirl well even
with twins in her belly.

1033
00:31:39,878 --> 00:31:43,871
I heard the officials of Kumsan
were caught for embezzlement.

1034
00:31:47,886 --> 00:31:54,893
It was well taken care of.

1035
00:31:54,893 --> 00:31:58,886
Forget it and have a drink.

1036
00:32:23,922 --> 00:32:25,924
Look here, Soonchun.

1037
00:32:25,924 --> 00:32:28,927
Seems like this feast will go on all night.

1038
00:32:28,927 --> 00:32:34,933
- Are you staying till the end?
- Of course.

1039
00:32:34,933 --> 00:32:36,935
After the feast, Chunhyang will be flogged
to death.

1040
00:32:36,935 --> 00:32:40,928
I won't miss it for anything.

1041
00:32:37,936 --> 00:32:41,929
Our henchman can kill a person with one blow.

1042
00:32:39,938 --> 00:32:43,942
I'm sure there's someone here like that, too.

1043
00:32:43,942 --> 00:32:46,945
Why do you think there
are so many people outside?

1044
00:32:46,945 --> 00:32:49,948
There are so many people!

1045
00:32:49,948 --> 00:32:53,941
Looks like all the beggars around Namwon.

1046
00:32:50,949 --> 00:32:54,942
Two cows, fifteen pigs
and all the chickens in Namwon.

1047
00:32:57,956 --> 00:33:01,949
There's got to be something for us too.

1048
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:04,963
Halt! You can't go in!

1049
00:33:04,963 --> 00:33:13,972
Step aside.

1050
00:33:13,972 --> 00:33:23,982
I said you can't enter!

1051
00:33:23,982 --> 00:33:27,975
Get out of my way!
I'm a nobleman too!

1052
00:33:24,983 --> 00:33:37,996
Step down!

1053
00:33:37,996 --> 00:33:42,000
Move away!
Can't you recognize a noble?

1054
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,001
Step down!

1055
00:33:43,001 --> 00:33:47,005
You're tearing a poor noble's clothes!

1056
00:33:47,005 --> 00:33:53,011
What's all this noise?
- Let go of me!

1057
00:33:53,011 --> 00:33:57,004
What's all this noise?

1058
00:33:55,013 --> 00:33:59,006
A noble who looks like
a beggar insists we let him in.

1059
00:33:57,015 --> 00:34:01,019
- Governor Byun.
- Yes.

1060
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:05,012
Although they're outworn,
he wears the clothes of a noble.

1061
00:34:05,023 --> 00:34:09,016
Just seat him in the corner,
and send him away after a drink.

1062
00:34:08,026 --> 00:34:13,031
If you desire Lord of Unbong.

1063
00:34:13,031 --> 00:34:18,036
Let him in.

1064
00:34:18,036 --> 00:34:22,040
You may enter.

1065
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,033
Take your shoes off first!

1066
00:34:25,043 --> 00:34:31,049
Look here.

1067
00:34:31,049 --> 00:34:35,042
I look at your table and mine,
and it makes me angry.

1068
00:34:34,052 --> 00:34:38,045
Since you're late, it seems
your table was hastily made.

1069
00:34:36,054 --> 00:34:41,059
You may take
anything you'd like from mine.

1070
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:45,063
Here, have a drink.

1071
00:34:45,063 --> 00:34:49,067
Lord of Unbong.

1072
00:34:49,067 --> 00:34:57,075
Yes.

1073
00:34:57,075 --> 00:35:02,080
There will be a big
meeting in Goksung this winter.

1074
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:08,086
Please come.

1075
00:35:08,086 --> 00:35:15,093
Of course.

1076
00:35:15,093 --> 00:35:19,097
Look here.

1077
00:35:19,097 --> 00:35:23,101
You say you're Lord of Unbong town.

1078
00:35:23,101 --> 00:35:30,108
Yes I am.

1079
00:35:30,108 --> 00:35:34,101
Then call
a courtesan to sing for me also.

1080
00:35:34,112 --> 00:35:38,116
Sing for this guest.

1081
00:35:38,116 --> 00:35:42,109
He demands a singing courtesan too!

1082
00:35:46,124 --> 00:35:50,117
If you drink this wine,

1083
00:36:01,139 --> 00:36:05,132
for thousands of years

1084
00:36:10,148 --> 00:36:14,141
you will beg.

1085
00:36:13,151 --> 00:36:17,144
Since I cannot beg
for thousands of years alone,

1086
00:36:18,156 --> 00:36:22,149
why don't we all have
a drink and divide these years.

1087
00:36:20,158 --> 00:36:24,162
What a rude remark.

1088
00:36:24,162 --> 00:36:29,167
For your hospitality,

1089
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:33,160
I'd like to improvise
a poem in honor of the new governor.

1090
00:36:33,171 --> 00:36:36,174
Governor.
Since this boy has no manners,

1091
00:36:36,174 --> 00:36:40,178
his writing will be poor.

1092
00:36:40,178 --> 00:36:44,171
Just send him away after he writes it.

1093
00:36:48,186 --> 00:36:53,191
Two words.

1094
00:36:53,191 --> 00:36:57,184
If you can't write a poem
with them, you will be clubbed.

1095
00:36:57,195 --> 00:37:01,199
Good.

1096
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:05,192
Then give it to me.

1097
00:37:05,169 --> 00:37:09,162
Lives and feast.

1098
00:37:10,174 --> 00:37:14,167
Sure, he must know
they go in the second and last line.

1099
00:37:14,178 --> 00:37:18,171
It's not very good
so please correct it if it's wrong.

1100
00:37:17,181 --> 00:37:20,184
I apologize for my disturbance.

1101
00:37:20,184 --> 00:37:24,177
How tasteless...

1102
00:37:24,188 --> 00:37:28,181
"This wine in golden vases is
the blood of a thousand people.

1103
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:32,185
The food on these jade tables
is the flesh of ten thousand lives.

1104
00:37:40,204 --> 00:37:44,197
When the candle wax drops,
tears of starving peasants fall.

1105
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:50,203
And the people's complaints get louder
to pair this noisy feast."

1106
00:37:52,216 --> 00:37:56,209
This poem is laced with poison!

1107
00:38:01,225 --> 00:38:34,258
This is foolish.

1108
00:38:34,258 --> 00:38:42,266
Something has come up.
I must be going.

1109
00:38:42,266 --> 00:38:47,271
- I have to leave also.
-Why are you leaving?

1110
00:38:47,271 --> 00:38:51,264
My wife is very ill today.
I have to care for her quickly.

1111
00:38:50,274 --> 00:38:56,280
I have some urgent matters too.

1112
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,273
Why are all of you worried
over some beggar's poem?

1113
00:38:58,282 --> 00:39:02,275
Please sit down.

1114
00:39:02,286 --> 00:39:06,290
Look at Mongryong,

1115
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:10,283
He worries everyone might run away.

1116
00:39:09,293 --> 00:39:14,298
He runs out to the terrace,
and flicks open his fan.

1117
00:39:14,298 --> 00:39:21,305
Hidden in the crowd,

1118
00:39:21,305 --> 00:39:25,298
the envoy sees the signal
and storms out of the crowd,

1119
00:39:25,309 --> 00:39:28,312
They brandish their clubs,

1120
00:39:28,312 --> 00:39:30,314
raise the royal medallion like the sun,

1121
00:39:30,314 --> 00:39:34,307
thrust into the gates and shout...

1122
00:39:37,321 --> 00:39:41,314
In the King's name,
you're all under arrest!

1123
00:39:42,326 --> 00:39:46,319
You're all under arrest!

1124
00:40:08,352 --> 00:40:12,345
In the King's name,
you're all under arrest!

1125
00:40:10,354 --> 00:40:14,347
As if the heaven
collapses and the earth trembles,

1126
00:40:12,356 --> 00:40:16,349
hundreds of spectators
scatter like gushing streams.

1127
00:40:14,358 --> 00:40:18,362
What can be more frightening

1128
00:40:18,362 --> 00:40:20,364
then the thunderous roar
of the royal envoy?

1129
00:40:20,364 --> 00:40:22,366
Who can bear this whirling wind?

1130
00:40:22,366 --> 00:40:23,367
When the governor's
guests are panicking all over,

1131
00:40:23,367 --> 00:40:25,369
look at their servants'
ridiculous movements.

1132
00:40:25,369 --> 00:40:28,372
Food is stomped on,
and vases are broken,

1133
00:40:28,372 --> 00:40:33,377
Drums are split into two,
gongs roll off the pavilion

1134
00:40:33,377 --> 00:40:38,382
to make their own sound.

1135
00:40:38,382 --> 00:40:40,384
Harp strings are crushed.

1136
00:40:40,384 --> 00:40:45,389
Courtesans pin chopsticks in their hair.

1137
00:40:45,389 --> 00:40:49,382
Musicians lose their horns,
and blow from their hands.

1138
00:40:49,393 --> 00:40:53,397
Soldiers lose their guns,
and shoot from their mouths.

1139
00:40:53,397 --> 00:40:55,399
Some bump their heads,
and bleed from their nose.

1140
00:40:55,399 --> 00:40:59,392
Some fall on their face and cry,

1141
00:40:57,401 --> 00:41:22,426
passers by also run and shouts...

1142
00:41:22,426 --> 00:41:26,419
Oh no!
Our town is in trouble!

1143
00:41:25,429 --> 00:41:29,422
Namwon has the richest rice supply.

1144
00:41:30,434 --> 00:41:34,427
But you stole from it,
impoverishing the people.

1145
00:41:34,438 --> 00:41:38,431
You're supposed to keep
a close watch on the governor,

1146
00:41:38,442 --> 00:41:42,435
but you fattened
your pockets while lying to him.

1147
00:41:41,445 --> 00:41:45,438
You ignored the sick and
desperate peasants who live in misery.

1148
00:41:43,447 --> 00:41:45,449
Divide what they stole from
the poor and gave it back to them.

1149
00:41:45,449 --> 00:41:48,452
Release all the innocent people in jail.

1150
00:41:48,452 --> 00:41:52,445
And bring Chunhyang to me!

1151
00:41:50,454 --> 00:41:53,457
Chunhyang, we're here!

1152
00:41:53,457 --> 00:41:55,459
All of Namwon's
widows will stand by your side!

1153
00:41:55,459 --> 00:41:59,452
So don't worry!

1154
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:02,466
Untie her!

1155
00:42:02,466 --> 00:42:06,459
Yes, sir!

1156
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:14,478
Chunhyang, hear me out!

1157
00:42:14,478 --> 00:42:18,471
As a courtesan's daughter,
you disobeyed the governor!

1158
00:42:27,491 --> 00:42:31,484
How do you expect to live?

1159
00:42:31,495 --> 00:42:35,488
Serving two husbands
is the same as serving two kings.

1160
00:42:53,517 --> 00:43:00,524
So what injustice have I done?

1161
00:43:00,524 --> 00:43:04,517
Since you refused the
governor, will you refuse me also?

1162
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:10,523
I thought the king
sent you to help the people,

1163
00:43:08,532 --> 00:43:10,534
but you're just like the
governor and other officials!

1164
00:43:10,534 --> 00:43:14,527
Stop humiliating me,
and just kill me!

1165
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:20,533
Give this to Chunhyang,
and tell her look up at me.

1166
00:43:19,543 --> 00:43:23,536
He said to take this,
and look at him.

1167
00:43:22,546 --> 00:43:27,551
Don't just stand there!

1168
00:43:27,551 --> 00:43:31,544
Bring her to the main chamber!

1169
00:43:28,552 --> 00:43:34,558
Move away!

1170
00:43:34,558 --> 00:43:36,560
Chunhyang!

1171
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,553
Chunhyang, wake up.

1172
00:43:44,568 --> 00:43:49,573
Why did you do it?

1173
00:43:49,573 --> 00:43:53,566
If you had told me,
I would've slept peacefully.

1174
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,593
But I stayed up
all night worried about dying!

1175
00:44:21,605 --> 00:44:25,598
Chunhyang.

1176
00:44:24,608 --> 00:44:29,613
Don't cry.

1177
00:44:29,613 --> 00:44:33,617
The King forbade me
to give away my secret.

1178
00:44:33,617 --> 00:44:37,621
Don't cry.

1179
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:42,626
Are the gates still closed off to me?

1180
00:44:42,626 --> 00:44:47,631
This belly bore Chunhyang!

1181
00:44:47,631 --> 00:44:51,624
I'm the mother-in-law
of the emissary!

1182
00:45:01,645 --> 00:45:03,647
People of Namwon,

1183
00:45:03,647 --> 00:45:07,651
listen to what I have to say.

1184
00:45:07,651 --> 00:45:10,654
Don't try to bear a son.

1185
00:45:10,654 --> 00:45:15,659
Bear a daughter like Chunhyang.

1186
00:45:15,659 --> 00:45:18,662
Raise her with tender and utmost care.

1187
00:45:18,662 --> 00:45:26,670
When a man from Seoul comes,

1188
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:30,663
take him in as your son-in-law!

1189
00:45:33,677 --> 00:45:34,678
Oh...she's my daughter!

1190
00:45:34,678 --> 00:45:39,683
Oh...he's my son-in-law!

1191
00:45:39,683 --> 00:45:43,687
When you came last night,

1192
00:45:43,687 --> 00:45:46,690
I already knew everything.

1193
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:55,699
So that your secret

1194
00:45:55,699 --> 00:45:57,701
doesn't get revealed,

1195
00:45:57,701 --> 00:46:00,704
I acted like that on purpose.

1196
00:46:00,704 --> 00:46:07,711
You were mad, weren't you?

1197
00:46:07,711 --> 00:46:14,718
Don't hate Governor Byun.

1198
00:46:14,718 --> 00:46:18,722
Without him,

1199
00:46:18,722 --> 00:46:22,715
how could my daughter
be a loyal wife?

1200
00:46:25,729 --> 00:46:30,734
You'll be sent to
Cholla province prison.

1201
00:46:30,734 --> 00:46:34,727
If you have any
objections, then do it there.

1202
00:46:35,739 --> 00:46:38,742
Adoring a pretty woman is natural.

1203
00:46:38,742 --> 00:46:42,735
But don't you think what you
did to Chunhyang was too harsh?

1204
00:46:42,746 --> 00:46:45,749
Class has a definite order.

1205
00:46:45,749 --> 00:46:48,752
A daughter of
a courtesan becomes one naturally.

1206
00:46:48,752 --> 00:46:51,755
She didn't disobey just me,

1207
00:46:51,755 --> 00:46:55,748
but she disgraced
the law, and committed treason.

1208
00:46:54,758 --> 00:46:58,751
It wasn't injustice...

1209
00:46:57,761 --> 00:46:59,763
it was her will to be a human being.

1210
00:46:59,763 --> 00:47:00,764
Later...Mongryong

1211
00:47:00,764 --> 00:47:01,765
goes from town to town,

1212
00:47:01,765 --> 00:47:09,773
and finishes his investigation.

1213
00:47:09,773 --> 00:47:13,766
He returns to Seoul,

1214
00:47:13,777 --> 00:47:16,780
and reports what he had seen.

1215
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:21,785
The King compliments him...

1216
00:47:21,785 --> 00:47:25,778
You saved the country
from great worry.

1217
00:47:24,788 --> 00:47:41,805
You're a national hero.

1218
00:47:41,805 --> 00:47:46,810
Another official tells the King

1219
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:50,803
about loyal Chunhyang of Namwon

1220
00:47:50,814 --> 00:47:55,819
and the King bestows on her

1221
00:47:55,819 --> 00:48:00,824
an honorable award for loyalty.

1222
00:48:00,824 --> 00:48:05,829
As for the people of Namwon,

1223
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:08,832
the King lifts the taxes.

1224
00:48:08,832 --> 00:48:12,825
They all live in peace,

1225
00:48:12,836 --> 00:48:16,829
but who knows
what will happen after this story.
