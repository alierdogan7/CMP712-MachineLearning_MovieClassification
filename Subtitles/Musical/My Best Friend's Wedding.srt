03:32:05,258 --> 03:32:10,195
That won't get you
into his arms

7
03:32:10,263 --> 03:32:13,232
So if you're looking
to find love

03:32:36,957 --> 03:32:41,894
Wear your hair

43
03:36:05,832 --> 03:36:10,098
lt's Mlchael.

03:36:10,170 --> 03:36:15,938

45
03:36:16,009 --> 03:36:19,945
Oall me. 4:00 in the mornlng,
whatever. We gotta talk. Bye.

46
03:36:20,013 --> 03:36:24,109
- Who called? Man ot the moment?
- No, the opposite.

47
03:36:24,184 --> 03:36:28,052
It's my Michael. Michael O'NeaI.
Sounds desperate to talk to me.

48
03:36:28,121 --> 03:36:31,579
The wandering sportswriter.
Remind me about that one.

49
03:36:31,658 --> 03:36:33,091
Sophomore year at Brown...

50
03:36:33,159 --> 03:36:36,788
we had this one hot month.

51
03:36:36,863 --> 03:36:40,799
But you know me.
l got restless.

52
03:36:40,867 --> 03:36:44,462
So l get up the nerve
to break his heart...

53
03:36:44,537 --> 03:36:46,528
and he gives me this look.

54
03:36:47,907 --> 03:36:50,137
Then he said, ''The thing
that makes me want to cry is...

55
03:36:50,210 --> 03:36:53,475
I'm losing the best triend
l ever had.''

56
03:36:53,546 --> 03:36:57,312
At that moment,
l knew l telt the same waY.

57
03:36:57,384 --> 03:37:01,320
So l cried for maybe
the third time in my entire lite...

58
03:37:01,388 --> 03:37:02,980
kissed him...

59
03:37:03,056 --> 03:37:05,820
and we've been best friends
ever since.

60
03:37:07,060 --> 03:37:09,324
We've seen each other
through everything:

61
03:37:11,231 --> 03:37:13,165
losing jobs...

62
03:37:13,233 --> 03:37:15,667
losing parents, Iosing lovers.

63
03:37:15,735 --> 03:37:18,602
We've traveled all over.

64
03:37:18,671 --> 03:37:21,333
The best times ot my lite, maybe.

65
03:37:21,408 --> 03:37:25,504
Drinking and talking,
even if it's just over the phone.

66
03:37:25,578 --> 03:37:28,945
Go on. This is so moving.
Kindred spirits?

67
03:37:29,015 --> 03:37:32,678
He's nothing like me.
He's like You actuaIly, only straight.

68
03:37:33,987 --> 03:37:37,479
l rememher this one night
in Tucson six years ago.

69
03:37:37,557 --> 03:37:40,526
He takes a razor out
ot this little shaving kit...

70
03:37:40,593 --> 03:37:43,528
cuts his tinger, takes my hand,
does the same to me.

71
03:37:43,596 --> 03:37:46,861
- l'm gonna be sick.
- He says, ''Swear when we're 28...

72
03:37:46,933 --> 03:37:49,834
it we've never married,
we marry each other.''

73
03:37:49,903 --> 03:37:52,565
We never talked about it again.

74
03:37:52,639 --> 03:37:56,370
l don't know
what made me think ot that.

75
03:37:56,443 --> 03:37:59,640
You're about to be 28
in three weeks, right?

76
03:38:00,780 --> 03:38:04,910
- How old is he?
- You think?

77
03:38:04,984 --> 03:38:07,782
Desperate to talk.

78
03:38:16,296 --> 03:38:17,729
Cheers.

but l was thinking about you,
and I was remembering...

96
03:39:30,370 --> 03:39:35,307

97
03:39:35,375 --> 03:39:38,139

You haven't realIy seen anybody

He adored me

137
03:41:50,510 --> 03:41:54,139
- l can see why.
- She has known him for tive seconds.

138
03:41:54,213 --> 03:41:57,614
Plus, she's got hilIions ot dollars,

And then you say hello

144
03:42:17,570 --> 03:42:20,801
l can hardly speak

145
03:42:20,873 --> 03:42:24,309
My heart is heating so

146
03:42:24,377 --> 03:42:27,972
And anyone can tell

147
03:42:28,047 --> 03:42:31,141
You think you know me well

148
03:42:31,217 --> 03:42:34,584
But you don't know me

149
03:42:37,390 --> 03:42:41,486

156
03:43:17,597 --> 03:43:20,623
This just makes everything

157
03:43:20,700 --> 03:43:25,228
Since l've met Michael, all l've heard
is ''J ulianne this'' and ''J ulianne that.''

158
03:43:26,105 --> 03:43:28,073

163
03:43:49,796 --> 03:43:54,529
Shouldn't you promote a bridesmaid
or someone you've known longer?

164
03:43:54,600 --> 03:43:58,058
My bridesmaids are my only two
temale relatives under the age ot 40...

165
03:43:58,137 --> 03:44:02,073
debutante sisters trom Nashville
who are basically vengetul sluts.

166
03:44:02,141 --> 03:44:03,438

to torce yourself to get personal.

169
03:44:25,998 --> 03:44:28,592
- Do you like the color?
- l think it's beautitul.

170
03:44:28,668 --> 03:44:30,602
- lsn't that pertect tor her?
- Absolutely.

171
03:44:30,670 --> 03:44:33,605
This is going to be tighter.
You don't want those things to fall out.

172
03:44:33,673 --> 03:44:36,801
- lt's beautitul.
- l'm not hurting you.

173
03:44:36,876 --> 03:44:41,711
l don't want her to trip,
so l'Il take this up a tiny bit.

174
03:44:41,781 --> 03:44:44,147
Would you rather the dattodil?

175
03:44:46,219 --> 03:44:49,950
l thought the bridesmaids
all wore the same dress.

176
03:44:50,022 --> 03:44:54,049
Not you. You wouldn't he comtortabIe
unless you were distinctive.

177
03:44:56,696 --> 03:44:58,926
What else did he tell you?

178
03:44:58,998 --> 03:45:01,967
You hate weddings.
You never go.

179
03:45:02,034 --> 03:45:04,468
You're not up
tor anything conventional...

180
03:45:04,537 --> 03:45:08,473
or anything that's assumed
to be a female priority...

181
03:45:09,709 --> 03:45:13,975
including marriage
or romance or even--

182
03:45:14,046 --> 03:45:15,638
Love?

183
03:45:17,550 --> 03:45:20,314
Michael and I were a wrong tit
right trom the start.

184
03:45:20,386 --> 03:45:22,980
He said that too.

185
03:45:23,055 --> 03:45:27,321
l thought l was like you,
and proud to be...

186
03:45:27,393 --> 03:45:30,521
until l met rumpled,
smelly, old Michael.

187
03:45:30,596 --> 03:45:32,996
Then l tound l was just
a sentimental schmuck...

188
03:45:33,065 --> 03:45:36,660
like all those tlighty nitwits
l'd always pitied.

189
03:45:36,736 --> 03:45:38,727
lt's tunny, huh?

190
03:45:40,072 --> 03:45:42,666
l need a cigarette.

191
03:45:51,417 --> 03:45:53,351
George, how do you thlnk l leel?

192
03:45:53,419 --> 03:45:56,013
All she does is talk
about her and Michael's tuture.

193
03:45:56,088 --> 03:46:00,991
- She's just so dreamy.
- Jules, pull yoursell together.

194
03:46:01,060 --> 03:46:03,290
l don't know it l can do it.

195
03:46:05,197 --> 03:46:07,688
You want me to turn around
or something?

196
03:46:07,767 --> 03:46:11,533
Not the person l was expecting.

197
03:46:14,573 --> 03:46:17,201
l've seen you
a lot more naked than that.

198
03:46:19,445 --> 03:46:23,882
Things are ditterent now.

199
03:46:27,620 --> 03:46:29,554
l guess so.

200
03:46:34,493 --> 03:46:37,553
You look really good...

201
03:46:37,630 --> 03:46:39,928
without your olothes on.

202
03:46:50,810 --> 03:46:52,243
She's toast.

203
03:46:54,313 --> 03:46:56,406
''Caution 2-Way Tratfic''
''Exit''

204
03:47:01,153 --> 03:47:03,747
- Where is the honeymoon exactly?
- lt depends.

205
03:47:03,823 --> 03:47:07,259
lt San Antonio sweeps Saoramento,
we could start there.
''Ohicago Hilton And Towers''

206
03:47:07,326 --> 03:47:09,760
Or Phoenix. Or depending
on the lndiana-Oleveland game--

207
03:47:09,829 --> 03:47:11,421
Garden spots, all.

208
03:47:11,497 --> 03:47:14,591
A swing ot mayhe 40 degrees Fahrenheit
represents a packing challenge...

209
03:47:14,667 --> 03:47:18,433
but there's tine tood and cocktails
at a choice ot Embassy Suites.

210
03:47:18,504 --> 03:47:22,565
It's his career. l'm supportive.
l've been everywhere.

211
03:47:22,641 --> 03:47:26,702
l want to be with the man l love.
That's what makes it a honeymoon.

212
03:47:26,779 --> 03:47:32,684
He's Iucky. One woman in a billion
could put up with his shit.

213
03:47:32,752 --> 03:47:35,915
The guy's a one-man festival
of idiosynoratio--

214
03:47:35,988 --> 03:47:38,582
You've been introduced
to the symphonic range--

215
03:47:38,657 --> 03:47:41,785
Ot his snoring?
He says it's worse than ever.

216
03:47:41,861 --> 03:47:44,159
You know that snartle one?

217
03:47:46,866 --> 03:47:50,962
Now it's got this phlegm-rattling thing
happening behind it.

218
03:47:58,544 --> 03:47:59,977
Earplugs work.

219
03:48:00,046 --> 03:48:03,174
- What about--
- Cigars in bed? l broke him ot that.

220
03:48:03,249 --> 03:48:06,116
The bathroom's a swamp.
He wears Reeboks to dinner.

221
03:48:06,185 --> 03:48:09,916
He likes action movies.
He reads over mY shoulder.

222
03:48:09,989 --> 03:48:11,854
He loves karaoke bars...

223
03:48:11,924 --> 03:48:14,154
- and l can't carry a tune.
- Really?

224
03:48:14,226 --> 03:48:16,660
He sucks soup
through his tront teeth.

225
03:48:16,729 --> 03:48:20,062
That's a trademark move.
Don't touch that one.

226
03:48:21,901 --> 03:48:24,335
But he sure can kiss.

227
03:48:26,572 --> 03:48:30,167
lt's been a while.
l'm just gonna take your word on that.

228
03:48:35,748 --> 03:48:40,014
After two weeks
ot oataloging all his taults...

229
03:48:40,086 --> 03:48:43,021
l made a command deoision
that changed my Iite.

230
03:48:48,094 --> 03:48:49,561
l threw the Iist away.

231
03:48:49,628 --> 03:48:51,892
He's not a balance sheet.
He's Michael.

232
03:48:51,964 --> 03:48:53,989
Loving him means
loving all ot him.

233
03:48:54,066 --> 03:48:55,795
Do you get nervous
in contined spaoes?

234
03:48:55,868 --> 03:48:57,859
lt's sweet ot you
to want to be protective...

235
03:48:57,937 --> 03:49:01,668
but nothing ever could give me
one moment's pause about this marriage.

236
03:49:01,740 --> 03:49:05,972
- Do you become hysterical in contined--
- Except one.

237
03:49:07,113 --> 03:49:09,343
You. You're always
in his mind....

238
03:49:09,415 --> 03:49:11,679
this pertect creature
he loved tor years.

239
03:49:11,750 --> 03:49:14,719
Pertection can get wearing
atter awhile.

240
03:49:14,787 --> 03:49:17,551
l'm not kidding. l had to tace up
to my competitive drives.

241
03:49:17,623 --> 03:49:19,887
Believe me, l've got them.

242
03:49:19,959 --> 03:49:23,224
Am l gonna be jealous ot you
tor the rest ot my life?

243
03:49:23,295 --> 03:49:25,354
- Our paths will keep orossing.
- Space. Ot course.

244
03:49:25,431 --> 03:49:26,898
- He'll always talk about you.
- lt's only natural.

245
03:49:26,966 --> 03:49:30,060
The answer was so simple.

246
03:49:30,136 --> 03:49:33,071
l was gonna predict that.

247
03:49:33,139 --> 03:49:34,572
You win.

248
03:49:37,409 --> 03:49:38,842
l've missed a step.

249
03:49:39,979 --> 03:49:42,914
He's got you on a pedestal...

250
03:49:42,982 --> 03:49:44,950
and me in his arms.

251
03:49:52,825 --> 03:49:56,784
My God, it's the bride
and the woman she'll never live up to.

252
03:49:56,862 --> 03:49:59,592
- Are you okay, honey?
- That wouId be us.

253
03:49:59,665 --> 03:50:02,259
Did she say the wrong thing again?
That is so in character.

254
03:50:02,334 --> 03:50:04,427
- l'm Julianne Potter.
- We'd be the vengetul sIuts.

255
03:50:04,503 --> 03:50:08,599
- You oan just call us eager.
- Have you sized up the groomsmen?

256
03:50:08,674 --> 03:50:12,610
- As maid of honor, you get first pick.
- Don't pick the short, hairy, tat one.

257
03:50:12,678 --> 03:50:15,112
- He's mine.
- Kimmy's a virgin.

258
03:50:15,181 --> 03:50:17,547
ls this Michael's Julianne?

259
03:50:17,616 --> 03:50:20,107
l'm lsabelle Wallace.

260
03:50:20,186 --> 03:50:22,984
My handsome new son
scarcely did you justice.

261
03:50:24,223 --> 03:50:27,624
My husband says
to scoot you to the ballpark...

262
03:50:27,693 --> 03:50:29,718
so you can hang with Michael.

263
03:50:29,795 --> 03:50:32,787
But tirst you have to meet
a lot ot really old women.

264
03:50:32,865 --> 03:50:36,130
That is, it you've absorbed
enough profanity.

265
03:50:50,182 --> 03:50:51,615
Who ordered a beer?

266
03:50:51,684 --> 03:50:56,451
- Let me help you with that.
- You unwittingly imply l'm olumsy.

267
03:50:56,522 --> 03:50:59,150
Sorry. l was contusing you

Remember, it is the duty

03:51:39,265 --> 03:51:42,496
to dance
with the maid of honor.

282
03:51:42,568 --> 03:51:45,036
Dance? You can't dance.

283
03:51:45,104 --> 03:51:50,041
- When did you learn to dance?
- l've got moves you've never seen.

284
03:51:51,477 --> 03:51:53,308
You're an impostor.

03:52:12,398 --> 03:52:15,561
- day atter daY, year atter year.
- That's what l thought at tirst.

290
03:52:15,634 --> 03:52:17,727
How can you like someone
that perfeot?

291
03:52:17,803 --> 03:52:21,398
No potential
tor long-range likability.

292
03:52:21,473 --> 03:52:25,239
But then, she does have
a tew good traits.

293
03:52:25,311 --> 03:52:26,744
- All right.

When l hug her,

l don't have to let go

297
03:52:34,486 --> 03:52:36,920
She lets me hoId her

03:52:36,989 --> 03:52:40,925

303
03:52:52,871 --> 03:52:55,738

Really?

311
03:53:24,737 --> 03:53:27,672
Any relationship over two weeks
l shouId know about?

312
03:53:28,607 --> 03:53:31,007
This is not about longevity.

313
03:53:32,344 --> 03:53:34,835
This is about...

314
03:53:34,913 --> 03:53:37,245
being comfortable...

315
03:53:37,316 --> 03:53:39,307

335
03:54:41,947 --> 03:54:43,881
Me hanging on in the rain.

336
03:54:43,949 --> 03:54:46,918
- l love Florence.
- And the guY with the thing.

337
03:54:49,154 --> 03:54:50,587
Where was my pass?

338
03:54:50,656 --> 03:54:53,557
- ''No, the pier is tor tishing!''
- ''French kissing?''

339
03:54:53,625 --> 03:54:57,061
- ''Fishing!''
- l've always loved Florence.

340
03:54:58,630 --> 03:55:03,067
You should take her there.
She's perky. She deserves a honeymoon.

341
03:55:05,971 --> 03:55:09,168
''lt San Antonio
sweeps Sacramento''?

342
03:55:09,241 --> 03:55:13,143
You're ott the road in September, and
when does talI quarter start tor you?

343
03:55:17,149 --> 03:55:21,279
l'm not coming back senior year.

344
03:55:23,822 --> 03:55:29,283
Don't architects find a degree
sort ot an asset?

345
03:55:29,361 --> 03:55:33,593
l travel every week. Got college hall,
motor sports, training oamps.

346
03:55:33,665 --> 03:55:36,600
I think the most important thing
is tor us to be together.

347
03:55:36,668 --> 03:55:41,469
Say, Pinky, l wanna hear you sing.
Oome on.

348
03:55:41,540 --> 03:55:43,804
Kimmy hates to sing.
She hates it.

349
03:55:47,813 --> 03:55:49,804
All right, tolks.
Everybody...

350
03:55:49,882 --> 03:55:54,376

03:55:56,722 --> 03:55:59,316
No, she doesn't want to, Michael.
Leave her alone.

03:55:59,391 --> 03:56:02,292
Oome on.
Ladies and gentlemen...

Like a summer rose

375
03:58:10,489 --> 03:58:15,756

All the paln

03:58:35,847 --> 03:58:38,338
That was just terrible!

379
03:58:47,292 --> 03:58:50,784
''Steakhouse'' ''Park'' ''Taxi''
- You won't be lonely without us?
- Desperately.

380
03:58:50,862 --> 03:58:53,797
- Maybe we don't have to go.
- Your grandmother's dinner?

381
03:58:53,865 --> 03:58:57,460
As bride-to-be,
she's got you on a teohnicality.

382
03:58:57,536 --> 03:59:02,803
l'd baby-sit you, but mY loyalty
is to the bride in her time of need.

383
03:59:02,874 --> 03:59:07,311
- lt's not really a time ot need.
- lt you're sure.

384
03:59:07,379 --> 03:59:11,543
- ''Sure''?
- l'll stay with Michael it you're sure.

385
03:59:15,053 --> 03:59:17,817
- Call me Iater?
- Ot oourse.

386
03:59:21,893 --> 03:59:24,487
- Bye.
- Have tun.

387
03:59:36,908 --> 03:59:39,502
Were you pretty shocked
when I told you?

388
03:59:39,578 --> 03:59:41,512
Shocked? No.

389
03:59:44,082 --> 03:59:46,175
A little.

390
03:59:46,251 --> 03:59:49,687
A lot.
l tell oft the bed.

391
03:59:50,922 --> 03:59:53,720
That explains the thump.

392
03:59:53,792 --> 03:59:56,022
You like her, don't you?

393
03:59:57,929 --> 04:00:01,365
- I do.
- That's enthusiastic.

394
04:00:01,433 --> 04:00:04,869
l mean, she's--
She's great.

395
04:00:07,939 --> 04:00:12,035
She seriously
can't sing a note.

396
04:00:12,110 --> 04:00:17,013
But to make that kind
ot sacritice--

397
04:00:17,082 --> 04:00:22,076
- What? Leaving school?
- All of it.

398
04:00:22,154 --> 04:00:25,715
Putting her career on hold
to tollow you around in this dumb job...

399
04:00:25,791 --> 04:00:28,555
where you travel 52 weeks a year...

400
04:00:28,627 --> 04:00:32,063
to places
like Oollege Station, Texas.

401
04:00:32,130 --> 04:00:36,191
- ''Dumb job''?
- lt's not a grown-up job.

402
04:00:36,268 --> 04:00:38,759
My joh never hothered you betore.

403
04:00:38,837 --> 04:00:42,830
lt doesn't bother me now,
but l'm not Kimmy.

404
04:00:42,908 --> 04:00:48,471
Her tather owns the Sox
and cable sports.

405
04:00:50,148 --> 04:00:54,084
l'm just surprised
it hasn't come up, that's all.

406
04:00:54,152 --> 04:00:55,744
What?

407
04:00:57,489 --> 04:00:59,548
The corner ottice with a view.

408
04:00:59,624 --> 04:01:02,422
You in a nice blue suit.

409
04:01:02,494 --> 04:01:06,760
Permanent Ohicago address,
somewhat close to Mom and Dad.

410
04:01:06,832 --> 04:01:08,424
Never.

411
04:01:08,500 --> 04:01:11,162
She would never even think ot that.

412
04:01:12,437 --> 04:01:14,371
You don't know her.

413
04:01:23,014 --> 04:01:25,107
- But Michael loves his job.
- Sure.

414
04:01:25,183 --> 04:01:28,277
Bad games, bad pay,
bad towns, had flights...

415
04:01:28,353 --> 04:01:30,787
bad hotels, real had food...

416
04:01:30,856 --> 04:01:32,949
homeless, rootless, lonely...

417
04:01:33,024 --> 04:01:35,288
your copy makes it
in one issue out of tour.

418
04:01:35,360 --> 04:01:37,294
What's not to love?

419
04:01:37,362 --> 04:01:41,128
Why would he trade that tor running,
say, a piece ot the public relations...

420
04:01:41,199 --> 04:01:44,965
at a powerfuI complex conglomerate
Iike your father's?

421
04:01:45,036 --> 04:01:49,336
- That's what my tather and l discussed.
- l'm not surprised.

422
04:01:51,376 --> 04:01:54,140
So do you think
he'd really accept?

423
04:01:54,212 --> 04:01:55,804
Michael?
A job like that?

424
04:01:55,881 --> 04:01:59,476
It would be the greatest thing
that ever happened to him.

425
04:01:59,551 --> 04:02:01,985
Present company excepted.

426
04:02:02,053 --> 04:02:06,854
Thls ls what we do:
We make your dad a cooonspirator.

427
04:02:06,925 --> 04:02:08,859
Mlohael does a lavor lor Walter.

428
04:02:08,927 --> 04:02:11,487

04:02:11,563 --> 04:02:13,997
and needs a brilllant guy
that he's close to...

430
04:02:14,065 --> 04:02:16,499
that he can completely trust.

431
04:02:16,568 --> 04:02:19,503
Then you beg.
''Mlchael, please do this lor Daddy.

432
04:02:19,571 --> 04:02:23,063
lt's only slx months.
lt would mean so muoh to me. "

433
04:02:25,143 --> 04:02:29,842
- He'll see right through it.
- Only if he wants to.

434
04:02:30,749 --> 04:02:32,182
At the end ot six months...

435
04:02:32,250 --> 04:02:34,980
he will be happy...

436
04:02:35,053 --> 04:02:36,782

Wow.

439
04:02:55,907 --> 04:02:58,375
You look beautiful.
Do you have a date later?

440
04:02:58,443 --> 04:02:59,876
Never can tell.

441
04:03:01,246 --> 04:03:04,807
Just the way you look tonlght
Remember?

442
04:03:06,451 --> 04:03:09,750
Okay, kid, you're up.

443
04:03:19,631 --> 04:03:22,725
lt's really my father
who needs the favor.

444
04:03:25,303 --> 04:03:29,740
He's reorganizing some
ot the divisions of the company.

445
04:03:29,808 --> 04:03:33,175
Public reIations
is a real problem area tor him.

446
04:03:35,647 --> 04:03:39,276
It would only be
six months mayhe.

447
04:03:40,986 --> 04:03:45,252
- Qr three or tour.
- You knew about this?

448
04:03:45,323 --> 04:03:49,316
l think you ought to listen to her.
lt's her Iite too.

449
04:03:52,030 --> 04:03:54,965
You gonna tell me
that Walter thought this one up?

450
04:03:55,033 --> 04:03:59,094
Why don't you start
by being honest one seoond.

451
04:03:59,170 --> 04:04:01,434
l am being honest.

452
04:04:01,506 --> 04:04:04,942

04:04:14,519 --> 04:04:17,716

- What am l supposed to do with my lite?

457

zero-respect job...

458
04:04:21,026 --> 04:04:24,154

459
04:04:27,232 --> 04:04:32,135
- lt sounds like a great opportunitY.
- Does it really?

460
04:04:32,203 --> 04:04:35,639
How oome you never took

because that isn't you.

462
04:04:38,209 --> 04:04:40,803
- And it's not me either.

463
04:04:40,879 --> 04:04:44,610
Damn straight that's how l teel !

You are so right.

We settled this, and l reneged.
That just wasn't tair.

472
04:05:19,451 --> 04:05:24,013
You have to torgive me and torget

473
04:05:24,089 --> 04:05:25,522
Please.

474

George and Werner are not ln.

476

04:06:12,804 --> 04:06:17,571
Mlchael and l are the same person:

481
04:06:17,642 --> 04:06:20,076
We deserve each other.

''The Drake''

487
04:07:13,464 --> 04:07:16,797
This is very Marcel Maroeau.

488
04:07:16,868 --> 04:07:21,464
Now, relax. We don't want your faoe
coming ott with it, do we?

489
04:07:21,539 --> 04:07:23,439
What a hideous room.

490
04:07:24,509 --> 04:07:27,808
Death by a mini-har.
How glamorous.

491
04:07:31,549 --> 04:07:34,484
You flew all the waY here.
You hate to tly.

We have a tamily thing in the Hamptons.

You're butting in.

494
04:07:41,893 --> 04:07:45,294
What l mean when l say
she's annoyingly pertect...

495
04:07:45,363 --> 04:07:48,161
is that there is nothing annoying
about her pertection.

496
04:07:48,233 --> 04:07:53,136
lt is vulnerable and endearing.
And that is annoying as shit.

497
04:07:53,204 --> 04:07:55,138
You like her.

498
04:07:55,206 --> 04:07:57,333
lt l didn't have to hate her,
l'd adore her.

499
04:07:58,576 --> 04:08:01,238
This is my whole lite's happiness.

500
04:08:01,312 --> 04:08:03,246
l have to be ruthless.

501
04:08:04,482 --> 04:08:07,007
He was in love with me
every day tor nine years.

502
04:08:07,085 --> 04:08:09,019
l oan make him happier
than she can.

503
04:08:09,087 --> 04:08:11,180
l am breaking her heart
in the short run...

504
04:08:11,256 --> 04:08:13,850
but really doing her
a gigantic favor.

505
04:08:13,925 --> 04:08:18,692
She would he so miserahle tagging along
after this insensitive doofus.

506
04:08:27,605 --> 04:08:30,199
Do you really love him...

507
04:08:30,275 --> 04:08:32,368
or is this just about winning?

508
04:08:32,443 --> 04:08:33,876
Seriously.

509
04:08:37,115 --> 04:08:41,711
ln the beginning,
it was mostly this prior cIaim.

510
04:08:41,786 --> 04:08:43,879
He belonged to me.

511
04:08:46,291 --> 04:08:50,227
But now, when l'm with him...

512
04:08:50,295 --> 04:08:54,061
he's just so wonderful.

513
04:08:54,132 --> 04:08:58,569
How oome l never knew that
when l could have had him?

514
04:08:58,636 --> 04:09:02,231
lt's amazing the clarity that comes
with psychotic jealousy.

515
04:09:04,976 --> 04:09:07,240
George, believe me...

516
04:09:07,312 --> 04:09:10,076
it he was feeIing
what l'm teeling...

517
04:09:10,148 --> 04:09:12,742
then he would know how l teel.

518
04:09:12,817 --> 04:09:15,251
lt's horrible.

519
04:09:15,320 --> 04:09:16,912
What?

520
04:09:18,489 --> 04:09:20,923
Just tell him you love him.

521
04:09:23,328 --> 04:09:27,765
Tell him You've loved him
tor nine years...

522
04:09:27,832 --> 04:09:30,426
but you were atraid ot love.

523
04:09:31,836 --> 04:09:35,101
Tell him you were atraid ot love,
atraid ot needing.

524
04:09:35,173 --> 04:09:37,937
- Needing what?
- To belong to someone.

525
04:09:38,009 --> 04:09:40,102
We all are, sweetheart.

526
04:09:40,178 --> 04:09:42,772
l'm sorry about that.

527
04:09:42,847 --> 04:09:48,342
Tell him this is the worst, cruelest,
dumhest moment to do this to him...

528
04:09:48,419 --> 04:09:50,284
but there it is.

529
04:09:50,355 --> 04:09:52,448
He's got to ohoose.

530
04:09:53,691 --> 04:09:56,785
Tell him the aotual truth?

531
04:09:56,861 --> 04:10:00,729
Maybe not the actuaI truth.

532
04:10:00,798 --> 04:10:04,427
Highlights.

533
04:10:10,041 --> 04:10:13,010
Arms at your sides, please.

534
04:10:25,056 --> 04:10:27,650
- Good morning.
- l have to talk to you.

535
04:10:27,725 --> 04:10:31,320
- You don't like the suit?
- That's not what l have to talk ahout.

536
04:10:31,396 --> 04:10:33,660
One thing tirst.
Excuse me.

537
04:10:40,238 --> 04:10:43,674
- Guard this with your lite.
- What is it?

538
04:10:43,741 --> 04:10:46,175
- The ring.
- Why are you giving it to me?

539
04:10:46,244 --> 04:10:49,179
- l don't trust Scotty with it.
- l don't think--

540
04:10:49,247 --> 04:10:51,010
Please.

541
04:10:51,082 --> 04:10:53,516
You're practically
the best man anyway.

542
04:10:53,584 --> 04:10:56,678
- Thank you.
- Open it.

543
04:10:58,256 --> 04:10:59,723
Will she like it?

544
04:11:06,597 --> 04:11:09,464
- What did you want to talk about?
- What?

545
04:11:09,534 --> 04:11:11,092
You wanted to talk
about something?

546
04:11:16,441 --> 04:11:19,501
We've known each other
a Iong time, right? TwentY years?

547
04:11:19,577 --> 04:11:22,705
Not that long, hut a long time.

548
04:11:22,780 --> 04:11:24,714
And in that time...

549
04:11:24,782 --> 04:11:29,310
we've grown close.

550
04:11:30,455 --> 04:11:33,049
Very close.
Do you know what l mean?

551
04:11:33,124 --> 04:11:35,752
- l think so.
- Good. So do l.

552
04:11:36,461 --> 04:11:39,055
So sometimes--

553
04:11:41,632 --> 04:11:43,099
Oould you exouse us?

554
04:11:48,473 --> 04:11:49,940
Sometimes...

555
04:11:50,007 --> 04:11:52,567
people think...

556
04:11:52,643 --> 04:11:55,237
they know how they teel
about each other...

557
04:11:55,313 --> 04:11:56,746
but they don't...

558
04:11:58,316 --> 04:11:59,783
until...

559
04:12:01,319 --> 04:12:02,809
until they do.

560
04:12:04,655 --> 04:12:06,088
l have a point.

561
04:12:07,325 --> 04:12:09,850
- Am l getting to it?
- Why don't you?

562
04:12:09,927 --> 04:12:13,158
Whatever it is you have to say
can't be that big a deal.

563
04:12:17,001 --> 04:12:21,665
''A big deal'' is a relative term.

564
04:12:35,453 --> 04:12:37,387
Who's that guy?

565
04:12:40,024 --> 04:12:43,152
lt's George. l've told you
about George. He's my editor.

566
04:12:43,227 --> 04:12:45,491
What's he doing here?
You working this weekend?

567
04:12:49,200 --> 04:12:52,795
- He's here to be with me.
- Why?

568
04:12:54,205 --> 04:12:59,302
Because he's my triend.
He's my good triend.

569
04:12:59,377 --> 04:13:00,969
My best triend these days.

570
04:13:04,549 --> 04:13:06,710
You've been busy.

571
04:13:08,553 --> 04:13:12,853
So all ot this
has been about George?

572
04:13:33,911 --> 04:13:35,845
l'm speechless.

573
04:13:35,913 --> 04:13:37,847
That's Jules.

574
04:13:37,915 --> 04:13:39,348
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

575
04:13:39,417 --> 04:13:41,385
What?

576
04:13:41,452 --> 04:13:45,252
l told him, puppY. lt we're engaged,
we shouldn't be ashamed ot it.

577
04:13:47,391 --> 04:13:51,191
He's raoing back to New York.
He just came in tor a tew hours...

578
04:13:51,262 --> 04:13:53,526
to fuck me.

579
04:13:58,436 --> 04:14:00,904
Takes a tew hours.

580
04:14:03,774 --> 04:14:05,207
God.

581
04:14:08,112 --> 04:14:10,205
Give me your ring.
Give it to me!

582
04:14:10,281 --> 04:14:13,876
When you ask a girl to marry you,
you have to give an engagement ring.

583
04:14:13,951 --> 04:14:17,045
l can't believe you're doing this to me.
l've come all this way to help you.

584
04:14:17,121 --> 04:14:20,716
- You're insane!
- For one day tind me irresistible.

585
04:14:29,200 --> 04:14:30,633
Stop it.

586
04:14:34,972 --> 04:14:36,769
ls something wrong?

587
04:14:39,143 --> 04:14:42,670
l guess it's just the way
You've always talked about George.

588
04:14:42,747 --> 04:14:46,205
lt always seemed...

589
04:14:46,283 --> 04:14:48,911
seemed like--

590
04:14:48,986 --> 04:14:52,854
- It sounded like George was--
- Gay?

591
04:14:52,923 --> 04:14:54,413
Actually, yes.

592
04:14:56,160 --> 04:14:58,788
Oommon misconception.

593
04:15:00,498 --> 04:15:02,796
lt is.

594
04:15:02,867 --> 04:15:08,362
George likes to pretend
that he's gay.

595
04:15:13,844 --> 04:15:15,869
And why would you do that?

596
04:15:17,348 --> 04:15:19,441
l tind it attracts women.

597
04:15:19,517 --> 04:15:22,042
lndeed.
Worked for me.

598
04:15:22,119 --> 04:15:23,609
Big time.

599
04:15:27,692 --> 04:15:29,853
Right.

600
04:15:35,366 --> 04:15:37,800
Qh, my God.
Race you to the altar.

601
04:15:39,036 --> 04:15:41,027
- Underplay.
- Got it.

602
04:15:41,105 --> 04:15:43,130
l'm Jules' tiance, George.

603
04:15:43,207 --> 04:15:47,473
Just in town tor a quick pre-conjugal
visit, it you catch my dritt.

604
04:15:47,545 --> 04:15:48,978
l do.

605
04:15:50,214 --> 04:15:52,648
- You're going to humiliate me.
- Only if l oan.

606
04:15:52,717 --> 04:15:55,277
Just one thing.
Stay away trom--

607
04:15:55,352 --> 04:15:57,980
George! Oh, my God!

608
04:16:00,391 --> 04:16:04,657
- l don't know why I'm so carried away.
- Me neither.

609
04:16:04,729 --> 04:16:06,162
lt's so--

610
04:16:07,898 --> 04:16:09,832
Against God's plan?

611
04:16:09,900 --> 04:16:12,801
No! lt's just wondertul !

612
04:16:12,870 --> 04:16:15,168
lt's so wondertul!

613
04:16:19,243 --> 04:16:20,676
Mom!

614
04:16:24,582 --> 04:16:28,018
- What?
- You have to meet George.

615
04:16:28,085 --> 04:16:30,519
You must be
Kimmy's little sister.

616
04:16:30,588 --> 04:16:34,115
Julianne's tiance.
They're going to be married.

617
04:16:34,191 --> 04:16:36,352
- What's going on?
- Julianne's getting married.

618
04:16:36,427 --> 04:16:38,895
- Why didn't you tell us?
- There hasn't been time.

619
04:16:38,963 --> 04:16:42,364
l wanted to. l wanted
to shout it from the rooftops...

620
04:16:42,433 --> 04:16:46,028
but Jules said,
''No, Pumpkin, no.

621
04:16:46,103 --> 04:16:47,536
This is Kimmy's day.

622
04:16:47,605 --> 04:16:50,039
Let's not take the attention
away trom Kimmy.

623
04:16:51,108 --> 04:16:53,042
Dear, sweet...

624
04:16:53,110 --> 04:16:55,738
adorable,
ohocolate-covered Kimmy.''

625
04:16:56,614 --> 04:16:59,310
Those were her very words.

626
04:16:59,383 --> 04:17:01,317
l think l'm gonna cry.

627
04:17:01,385 --> 04:17:03,216
Me too.

628
04:17:03,287 --> 04:17:06,051
This is so sweet ot you
to come to our rehearsal.

629
04:17:06,123 --> 04:17:08,182
l insist you stay tor lunch.

630
04:17:08,259 --> 04:17:10,159
- No, absolutely--
- Love to.

631
04:17:10,227 --> 04:17:13,822
Love the bag, love the shoes,
love everything. Love to.

632
04:17:13,898 --> 04:17:17,891
- Darling, what about your fIight?
- Canoeled.

633
04:17:24,141 --> 04:17:27,907
l can tell you this now,
but l was very worried about you.

634
04:17:27,978 --> 04:17:29,570
Ahout me?

635
04:17:29,647 --> 04:17:32,514
All those stories that Michael told me
were hilarious...

636
04:17:32,583 --> 04:17:36,542
but all those broken relationships,
all those men.

637
04:17:36,620 --> 04:17:39,885
It must have hurt going through so many
guys and never tinding the right one.

638
04:17:39,957 --> 04:17:43,688
She couldn't sit down for seven years
until she met teensy-weensY Iittle me.

639
04:17:44,862 --> 04:17:48,195
And the man of your dreams
was always there.

640
04:17:50,668 --> 04:17:53,330
She's talking about me.

641
04:17:54,171 --> 04:17:55,763
Yes, darling?

642
04:17:55,840 --> 04:18:00,106
- How did you and Julianne meet?
- George is my editor.

643
04:18:00,177 --> 04:18:02,441
But, Poopy,
we met a long time betore that.

644
04:18:02,513 --> 04:18:06,210
Actually,
it's a very romantic story.

645
04:18:06,283 --> 04:18:09,275
Would you like to tell it,
Sweet Pea?

646
04:18:09,353 --> 04:18:11,947
- lt's private.
- Not anymore.

647
04:18:13,524 --> 04:18:16,618
l tirst met Julianne...

648
04:18:16,694 --> 04:18:18,958
in a mental institution.

649
04:18:20,364 --> 04:18:22,628
Julianne was there visiting
some French chef...

650
04:18:22,700 --> 04:18:24,793
she'd sent insane
with a bad review...

651
04:18:24,869 --> 04:18:27,337
and l was there
visiting Dionne Warwick.

652
04:18:28,839 --> 04:18:31,171
He thought he was Dionne Warwick.

653
04:18:31,242 --> 04:18:35,338
- Who is Dionne Warwick?
- Saorilege, darling.

654
04:18:35,412 --> 04:18:37,004
She's Whitney Houston's aunt.

655
04:18:37,081 --> 04:18:39,311
She's very good
on the Psychic Friends Network.

656
04:18:39,383 --> 04:18:44,252
- lsn't she?
- Do you know the way to San Jose

657
04:18:50,394 --> 04:18:53,488
There l was with Dionne.
His real name, by the waY, is Jerry.

658
04:18:53,564 --> 04:18:57,000
We were having a sing-along,
then suddenly...

659
04:18:57,067 --> 04:19:00,833
breezing through the doors
from the shock therapy room...

660
04:19:00,905 --> 04:19:02,497
l saw her.

661
04:19:02,573 --> 04:19:05,201
A vision in pink.

662
04:19:07,411 --> 04:19:10,005
- You don't wear pink.
- She does.

663
04:19:10,080 --> 04:19:12,514
Sometimes she does wear pink.

664
04:19:12,583 --> 04:19:15,279
- You do.
- I do.

665
04:19:15,352 --> 04:19:17,547
l said to Dionne...

666
04:19:17,621 --> 04:19:20,988
''Dionne, who is this vision?

667
04:19:21,058 --> 04:19:24,858
Surely, she must be the understudy
to some fabulous Broadway star.

668
04:19:24,929 --> 04:19:27,363
Look at her skin.
Who does her hair?''

669
04:19:27,431 --> 04:19:30,264
- ln that moment, l knew.
- We don't all need to know--

670
04:19:30,334 --> 04:19:31,767
We do!

671
04:19:35,439 --> 04:19:39,034
- l'm very curious.
- They do.

672
04:19:39,109 --> 04:19:41,543
l knew...

673
04:19:41,612 --> 04:19:44,206
that someday
we'd end up like this:

674
04:19:44,281 --> 04:19:47,045
like some glittering...

675
04:19:47,117 --> 04:19:50,917
Doris Day-Rock Hudson
extravaganza.

676
04:19:52,556 --> 04:19:53,989
l said to Dionne...

677
04:19:54,058 --> 04:19:57,391
''Dionne, l'm in love.

678
04:19:57,461 --> 04:20:00,225
Could this siren love me?

679
04:20:00,297 --> 04:20:03,061
Are the gods that kind?''

680
04:20:03,133 --> 04:20:08,571
And Dionne turned to me,
opened her loveIy eyes and said...

681
04:20:15,179 --> 04:20:16,737
What did she say?

682
04:20:19,149 --> 04:20:21,310
The moment l wake up

683
04:20:24,421 --> 04:20:27,288
Belore l put on my makeup

684
04:20:27,358 --> 04:20:30,623

685
04:20:32,696 --> 04:20:35,164
While comblng my halr now

686
04:20:36,667 --> 04:20:39,693

l say a little prayer lor you

688
04:20:43,340 --> 04:20:46,867
Forever and ever

And l will love you

690
04:20:48,612 --> 04:20:51,445

That's how lt must be

693
04:20:56,020 --> 04:20:58,989

694
04:20:59,056 --> 04:21:01,718
Hearthreak lor me

695
04:21:01,792 --> 04:21:03,953

And all through

700
04:21:46,170 --> 04:21:48,502

04:21:49,740 --> 04:21:55,440
For me there is no one but you

702
04:21:56,547 --> 04:21:59,983
- Please love me too

Say you love me too

706
04:22:32,983 --> 04:22:35,417
All right, now!

707
04:22:37,454 --> 04:22:40,048
- Heartbreak for you, actually.
- You've made your point.

708
04:22:40,124 --> 04:22:45,494
Get on your plane. l'll call at the turn
ot the century when l've forgiven you.

709
04:22:47,798 --> 04:22:51,234
- lt never would have worked out.
- Because it was dishonest.

710
04:22:51,301 --> 04:22:52,791
Difterent temperaments.

711
04:22:55,806 --> 04:22:58,673
Look, tell him you love him.

712
04:22:59,977 --> 04:23:01,911
Bite the bullet.

713
04:23:13,157 --> 04:23:14,920
What will he do?

714
04:23:14,992 --> 04:23:16,926
''Be Caretul
Watch Your Step''

715
04:23:24,168 --> 04:23:26,762
He'll ohoose Kim.

716
04:23:26,837 --> 04:23:29,704
You'll stand beside her
at the wedding...

717
04:23:29,773 --> 04:23:32,936
kiss him good-bye
and go home.

718
04:23:34,711 --> 04:23:37,271
That's what you came here to do.

719
04:23:38,515 --> 04:23:40,449
So do it.

720
04:23:56,767 --> 04:23:59,964
George isn't my fiance, Miohael.

721
04:24:00,037 --> 04:24:01,766
lt's heen over tor ages...

722
04:24:01,838 --> 04:24:03,965
but he can't accept it.

723
04:24:04,041 --> 04:24:06,805
l'd built you up so muoh...

724
04:24:06,877 --> 04:24:10,074
l couldn't let him lose faoe
in tront ot you.

725
04:24:10,147 --> 04:24:15,642
He could never stack up to the one man
l measure everyone against.

726
04:24:21,892 --> 04:24:23,826
This is strange.

727
04:24:25,395 --> 04:24:27,829
l gotta tell you, when You--

728
04:24:27,898 --> 04:24:30,992
When you told me that You were
marrying George...

729
04:24:33,070 --> 04:24:36,597
l got this really strange--

730
04:24:39,576 --> 04:24:41,510
You were jealous?

731
04:24:47,517 --> 04:24:49,178
Orazy jealous.

732
04:24:51,288 --> 04:24:52,721
l'm sorry.

733
04:24:59,363 --> 04:25:02,560
Oan we maybe spend some time alone
this afternoon?

734
04:25:06,069 --> 04:25:08,560
Would that be all right?

735
04:25:35,932 --> 04:25:40,699
l've been thinking a Iot
the last couple ot days, about us.

736
04:25:40,771 --> 04:25:42,568
Have you?

737
04:25:46,510 --> 04:25:49,741
- There are a Iot ot memories.
- lt's more than that.

738
04:25:52,282 --> 04:25:56,241
lt's kind ot embarrassing
to say it this way, but...

739
04:25:57,788 --> 04:26:00,814
you've sort ot been,
you know...

740
04:26:00,891 --> 04:26:03,553
the woman in my life.

741
04:26:05,462 --> 04:26:08,454
You've been the man in mine.

742
04:26:08,532 --> 04:26:11,524
And I was thinking
this oould be our last time...

743
04:26:11,601 --> 04:26:14,593
alone together, you know?

744
04:26:17,207 --> 04:26:19,675
Except tor that hot aftair
we'll have twice a year.

745
04:26:19,743 --> 04:26:21,677
Except tor that.

746
04:26:29,186 --> 04:26:34,089
l mean, you commit
to this wedding...

747
04:26:34,157 --> 04:26:38,787
and then it seems
like there's this momentum...

748
04:26:38,862 --> 04:26:41,422
and then you torget
you chose it.

749
04:26:47,170 --> 04:26:49,331
You and l didn't--

750
04:26:49,406 --> 04:26:53,809
ln our relationships
with other people...

751
04:26:53,877 --> 04:26:58,314
we didn't use
the word love a Iot, did we?

752
04:27:01,451 --> 04:27:04,443
Kimmy says
it you Iove someone...

753
04:27:04,521 --> 04:27:07,012
you say it.

754
04:27:07,090 --> 04:27:09,251
You say it right then,
out loud.

755
04:27:10,560 --> 04:27:14,587
Otherwise,
the moment just--

756
04:27:14,664 --> 04:27:16,598
Passes you by.

757
04:27:39,156 --> 04:27:41,090
We don't even have a song.

758
04:27:42,392 --> 04:27:46,419
Kimmy and l don't have a song.

759
04:27:47,898 --> 04:27:49,866
Do you think that's a bad sign?

760
04:27:53,603 --> 04:27:55,628
Someday

761
04:27:55,705 --> 04:27:58,640
When l'm awlully low

762
04:27:58,708 --> 04:28:01,006
And the world ls cold

763
04:28:01,077 --> 04:28:05,639
l will leel a glow
just thlnklng ol you

764
04:28:07,517 --> 04:28:12,648
And the way you look tonlght

765
04:28:13,523 --> 04:28:15,718
ls your dance card tilled?

766
04:28:15,792 --> 04:28:19,091
l'd have to check.
l keep it on Powerbook these days.

767
04:28:19,162 --> 04:28:21,096
ls that right?

768
04:28:24,234 --> 04:28:26,168
Wlth each word

769
04:28:26,236 --> 04:28:29,228
your tenderness grows

770
04:28:30,640 --> 04:28:34,633
Tearlng my lears apart

771
04:28:36,746 --> 04:28:41,615
With each laugh
that wrlnkles your nose

772
04:28:41,685 --> 04:28:45,519
To uches my loolish heart

773
04:29:24,327 --> 04:29:25,760
Excuse me.

774
04:29:29,199 --> 04:29:32,464
- l thought Michael was picking me up.
- l said l'd drop you at the stag.

775
04:29:32,536 --> 04:29:35,630
He's got a lot to do.
I'm the unotficial best man.

776
04:29:35,705 --> 04:29:38,196
Ot course.

777
04:29:38,275 --> 04:29:43,212
Kim said when Michael turned the job
down that there was no friction.

778
04:29:43,280 --> 04:29:45,339
Friction? No.

779
04:29:45,415 --> 04:29:47,178
Good.

780
04:29:47,250 --> 04:29:49,980
l haven't caused a prohlem,
have l?

781
04:29:50,053 --> 04:29:52,385
You haven't. Nobody has.

782
04:29:54,057 --> 04:29:56,787
Listen,
you're just a little bit early.

783
04:29:56,860 --> 04:29:58,794
AotuaIly, l needed
to make some phone calls.

784
04:29:58,862 --> 04:30:01,558
- ls it possible to use your oftice?
- Ot oourse.

785
04:30:01,631 --> 04:30:04,156
- At the end ot the hall on the lett.
- Thank you.

786
04:30:05,635 --> 04:30:07,933
Take your time.

787
04:30:15,745 --> 04:30:17,679

800
04:31:11,701 --> 04:31:13,828
in my company.

801
04:31:13,903 --> 04:31:17,339
To his own detriment...

802
04:31:17,407 --> 04:31:19,341
Michael wilI not...

803
04:31:19,409 --> 04:31:23,345
accept our ofter...

804
04:31:23,413 --> 04:31:27,247
while he works tor you.

805
04:31:51,975 --> 04:31:55,342

''Do You Wish To Send?''
''Yes'' ''No''

809
04:32:06,456 --> 04:32:09,550
Why would l send this?
He'd get tired.

04:32:12,262 --> 04:32:13,991
''Save For Later'' ''Delete''

811
04:32:17,834 --> 04:32:19,267
Save tor later.

812
04:32:24,374 --> 04:32:26,171
lt's not like l'm sending it.

813
04:32:26,242 --> 04:32:29,143
l'm just saving it
for a few hours...

814
04:32:29,212 --> 04:32:32,010
till we come hack here and...

815
04:32:32,082 --> 04:32:33,845
Michael can see it.

816
04:32:33,917 --> 04:32:36,249
Perfectly harmless.

817
04:33:15,725 --> 04:33:17,158
''Wallace Oompany''

818
04:33:28,571 --> 04:33:32,007
Send out this, this,
not this, this.

819
04:33:32,075 --> 04:33:33,975
That's it.

820
04:33:34,043 --> 04:33:38,503
l'm holding tour or five e-mails

821
04:33:38,581 --> 04:33:41,914
- Yes, sir.
- Bye.

822
04:33:41,985 --> 04:33:43,885
All set?

823
04:33:45,321 --> 04:33:47,812
l can't believe this!
Did you try every key?

824
04:33:47,891 --> 04:33:50,223
lt's no big deal.
She just gave us the wrong keys.

825
04:33:50,293 --> 04:33:54,195
There's got to be a janitor
or a guard...

826
04:33:54,264 --> 04:33:57,756
or a cleaning woman
or, you know, some kind of--

827
04:33:57,834 --> 04:34:02,567
Somebody has to be in this huilding!
l need a hriok.

828
04:34:02,639 --> 04:34:04,937
What's the big deal
about getting this tile tonight?

829
04:34:06,409 --> 04:34:08,707
- l'm up against a deadline.
- Me too.

830
04:34:08,778 --> 04:34:11,645
- I'm getting married tomorrow.
- That's my point!

831
04:34:11,714 --> 04:34:14,080
Everybody wilI be busy
with more important things...

832
04:34:14,150 --> 04:34:16,641
and this is really mY Iast ohance.

833
04:34:16,719 --> 04:34:19,688
lf l oould just get up to Walter's
oftice, they're by the computer.

834
04:34:19,756 --> 04:34:23,021
Then l could just e-mail

835
04:34:23,092 --> 04:34:24,787
Tomorrow's Sunday.

836
04:34:24,861 --> 04:34:26,852
Nobody's doing business.

837
04:34:26,930 --> 04:34:31,458
Monday morning, crack ot dawn,
Walter wilI walk you right up there.

838
04:34:32,769 --> 04:34:34,703
Give it up, kid.

839
04:34:36,272 --> 04:34:37,705
Can't win them all.

840
04:34:51,721 --> 04:34:53,154
Good night.

This thing mean

842
04:35:08,004 --> 04:35:10,097
We'll use the phone
in your room.

843
04:35:10,173 --> 04:35:12,437
Walter's probably not even asIeep.

844
04:35:12,508 --> 04:35:15,443
- l'll drive you up there.
- Thank you !

845
04:35:15,511 --> 04:35:18,742
We'll get the right key,
and we'll go back to the ottice.

846

These are all trom Eric.
This fax is trom Erio too.

849
04:35:28,658 --> 04:35:31,149
My wedding. You'd think my boss
would Ieave me alone.

850
04:35:31,227 --> 04:35:33,161
Maybe it's congratulations.

851
04:35:43,940 --> 04:35:45,669
What is it?

852
04:35:52,482 --> 04:35:55,508
''Mike, l can't believe l'm doing this to
You on the night betore your wedding...

853
04:35:55,585 --> 04:35:59,817
but l think you need
and deserve...

854
04:35:59,889 --> 04:36:01,823
to know what
you're marrying into.

855
04:36:06,129 --> 04:36:09,690
l received the following e-maiI
this atternoon:

856
04:36:11,401 --> 04:36:14,859
'Erio, l need a tavor.
My daughter's every--'''

857
04:36:17,040 --> 04:36:19,372
lsabelle, l need to talk to Kim.

858
04:36:19,442 --> 04:36:21,910
- ls anythlng wrong?
- No, l'm just tired.

859
04:36:21,978 --> 04:36:24,674
PIease put her on.
Thanks.

860
04:36:28,217 --> 04:36:30,151
Oould you give me a minute?

861
04:36:31,955 --> 04:36:33,388
Please?

862
04:37:21,304 --> 04:37:24,102
Excuse me, miss.
Are you locked out?

863
04:37:27,377 --> 04:37:30,778
Just stepped out.
lt's a no-smoking room.

864
04:37:33,149 --> 04:37:35,310
lt's a nonsmoking tloor too.

865
04:37:35,385 --> 04:37:39,116
Maybe you could go down
to the lobby.

866
04:37:39,188 --> 04:37:41,213
Why don't you have me arrested?

867
04:37:43,459 --> 04:37:45,017
l mean it.

868
04:37:45,094 --> 04:37:48,791
l am a dangerous, criminal person.

869
04:37:51,167 --> 04:37:53,795
l do bad things
to honest people.

870
04:37:56,239 --> 04:37:58,867
You can make a citizen's arrest.
l wouldn't struggle.

871
04:37:58,941 --> 04:38:01,432
lt'd be like getting Al Capone
on tax evasion.

872
04:38:09,919 --> 04:38:12,149
Oan l help you, miss?

873
04:38:17,460 --> 04:38:19,621
Do you smoke, Richard?

874
04:38:20,363 --> 04:38:22,854
Yes, l do, but--

875
04:38:22,932 --> 04:38:24,729
lt's a nonsmoking tloor.

876
04:38:27,970 --> 04:38:29,904
But you know what?

877
04:38:51,894 --> 04:38:57,230
You know,
my grandmother always said...

878
04:38:59,335 --> 04:39:02,304
''This too shall pass.''

879
04:39:05,708 --> 04:39:07,141
Thanks, Riohard.

880
04:39:32,635 --> 04:39:35,900
l want you to quit this shit.

881
04:39:35,972 --> 04:39:37,405
lt'll kill you.

882
04:39:41,944 --> 04:39:43,377
What happened?

883
04:39:45,915 --> 04:39:48,713
lt's over.
She denied it.

884
04:39:48,784 --> 04:39:51,651
She said
l was orazy and paranoid.

885
04:39:51,721 --> 04:39:54,690
A bad combination.

886
04:39:54,757 --> 04:39:56,224
There's a big...

887
04:39:56,292 --> 04:39:59,921
brunch tomorrow morning
at her parents' house.

888
04:39:59,996 --> 04:40:02,760
She said,
''How could l call it oft?

889
04:40:05,067 --> 04:40:07,058
What am l supposed
to tell everyone?''

890
04:40:08,838 --> 04:40:11,170
It's for the best.
lt really is.

891
04:40:12,008 --> 04:40:13,942
She was right.

892
04:40:16,145 --> 04:40:18,113
l am crazy...

893
04:40:20,616 --> 04:40:23,107
to tall tor someone
l hardly knew.

894
04:40:28,424 --> 04:40:30,324
l'm so glad you're here.

895
04:40:37,466 --> 04:40:40,731
Have you stilI got that ring?

896
04:40:52,148 --> 04:40:54,981
l tried it on,
and it won't come ott.

897
04:41:33,456 --> 04:41:37,517
Why don't we take a walk
or have some tood sent up?

898
04:41:40,396 --> 04:41:42,557
l just want to be alone.

899
04:41:42,632 --> 04:41:44,896
ls that okay?

900
04:41:44,967 --> 04:41:46,400
Sure.

901
04:41:49,505 --> 04:41:54,568
Maybe l'll go back to New York
tor awhile and hang with you.

902
04:41:54,644 --> 04:41:59,377
Eric will understand.
Or we could go somewhere...

903
04:41:59,448 --> 04:42:00,881
if you want.

904
04:42:02,351 --> 04:42:05,047
''lt San Antonio
sweeps Sacramento--''

905
04:42:06,489 --> 04:42:08,423
l've never been to Texas.

906
04:42:57,506 --> 04:42:59,440
''Brown''

907
04:43:18,361 --> 04:43:19,794
You what?

908
04:43:42,451 --> 04:43:44,476
- Can l try that?
- Sure.

909
04:43:55,264 --> 04:43:57,323
- Exouse me.
- Good luck.

910
04:44:00,469 --> 04:44:02,699
So thls ls your baslc
call-oll-the-wedding party?

911
04:44:02,772 --> 04:44:06,401
l came here to confront everybody.
l won't slink away like some coward.

912
04:44:06,475 --> 04:44:09,171
Besides, she hasn't told anyone.
l don't know what l'm supposed to do.

913
04:44:09,245 --> 04:44:13,341
There is a wedding at 6:00.

914
04:44:20,122 --> 04:44:25,321
Have you changed your mind?
Do you want to marry Kimmy?

915
04:44:28,597 --> 04:44:32,124
l made a decision.
lt's over.

916
04:44:34,036 --> 04:44:35,970
l'll go telI them.

917
04:44:38,140 --> 04:44:42,236
First,
do you think she's all right?

918
04:44:43,179 --> 04:44:45,374
Could you
check on her tor me?

919
04:44:49,285 --> 04:44:52,277
These are the most beautitul tlowers
l've ever seen.

920
04:44:56,025 --> 04:44:57,458
How is he?

921
04:45:00,229 --> 04:45:02,823
He's sort ot wondering...

922
04:45:02,898 --> 04:45:06,197
why you haven't told your parents
that the wedding's ott.

923
04:45:07,837 --> 04:45:11,534
l don't know. l'm still hoping
tor a miracle, l suppose.

924
04:45:11,607 --> 04:45:15,099
How could he think that
my tather and l would do such a thing?

925
04:45:15,177 --> 04:45:18,271
l only minored in psych,
you understand, but...

926
04:45:20,049 --> 04:45:23,143
mayhe Michael couIdn't commit
to this marriage...

927
04:45:23,219 --> 04:45:25,881
so he created...

928
04:45:25,955 --> 04:45:27,388
a delusion...

929
04:45:27,456 --> 04:45:30,357
produced an unconscious,
psychosomatic...

930
04:45:30,426 --> 04:45:32,360
manitestation ot--

931
04:45:35,097 --> 04:45:36,689
l'm better with food.

932
04:45:39,235 --> 04:45:43,797
You're Michael.
You're in a fancy French restaurant.

933
04:45:43,873 --> 04:45:47,206
You order...

934
04:45:47,276 --> 04:45:49,369
oreme hrulee tor dessert.

935
04:45:50,446 --> 04:45:53,210
lt's beautitul. lt's sweet.

936
04:45:53,282 --> 04:45:56,945
lt's irritatingly pertect.

937
04:45:57,019 --> 04:45:59,613
Suddenly, Michael realizes...

938
04:45:59,688 --> 04:46:02,350
he doesn't want creme brulee.

939
04:46:02,424 --> 04:46:07,259
- He wants something eIse.
- What does he want?

940
04:46:09,565 --> 04:46:12,295
- Jell-O.
- ''J ell-O''?

941
04:46:13,502 --> 04:46:17,802
- Why Jell-O?
- He's comtortable with Jell-O.

942
04:46:17,873 --> 04:46:21,104
Jell-O makes him comtortable.

943
04:46:21,176 --> 04:46:23,303
l realize
compared to creme brulee...

944
04:46:23,379 --> 04:46:26,348
it's Jell-O,
but maybe that's what he needs.

945
04:46:28,384 --> 04:46:29,942
l could be Jell-O.

946
04:46:31,587 --> 04:46:34,181
Oreme brulee
oan never be Jell-O.

947
04:46:34,256 --> 04:46:36,952
You oould never be Jell-O.

948
04:46:37,026 --> 04:46:40,223
- l have to be Jell-O.
- you'll never be Jell-O.

949
04:46:40,296 --> 04:46:45,427
Tell your parents. If you're waiting
for that ''do you take this man'' part...

950
04:46:45,501 --> 04:46:47,696
- it's considered poor torm.
- l love him.

951
04:46:48,904 --> 04:46:51,236
Whatever delusions
l drove Michael to...

952
04:46:51,307 --> 04:46:53,241
there's truth
at the heart ot it.

953
04:46:53,309 --> 04:46:56,574
l want him to work
tor my father.

954
04:46:56,645 --> 04:46:59,808
l want to stay in school,
and l want a life ot my own.

955
04:47:01,016 --> 04:47:04,782
Please, tell him it's my fault
and l love him.

956
04:47:06,221 --> 04:47:08,519
You're the only person
that l trust.

957
04:47:14,597 --> 04:47:17,327
- l'll be right baok.
- Thank you.

958
04:47:30,446 --> 04:47:32,573
How is she?

959
04:47:32,648 --> 04:47:36,015
- Knock it oft!
- Yes, sir!

960
04:47:38,020 --> 04:47:40,352
- l asked you--
- She admits that it's her fault.

961
04:47:40,422 --> 04:47:43,050
Totally, completely,
inexcusably her tault.

962
04:47:46,462 --> 04:47:48,430
Do you think
she still loves me?

963
04:47:51,867 --> 04:47:55,394
Love is a strong word...

964
04:47:55,471 --> 04:47:57,962
and l don't know that
l'm necessarily qualitied--

965
04:47:58,040 --> 04:48:02,067
l guess l wouldn't be totally ott base
it l said that, in her way...

966
04:48:02,144 --> 04:48:04,942
she does possess
strong teelings--

967
04:48:10,686 --> 04:48:12,620
Sure, she does.

968
04:48:13,522 --> 04:48:15,456
She's crazy about you.

969
04:48:15,524 --> 04:48:19,551

What did he say?

980
04:49:20,489 --> 04:49:21,922
He said...

981
04:49:25,461 --> 04:49:26,894
''Marry me.''

982
04:49:31,533 --> 04:49:35,060

04:49:43,412 --> 04:49:44,845
What's up?

987
04:49:56,558 --> 04:49:59,755
l have to say this quick or l'll
just have this massive coronary...

988
04:49:59,828 --> 04:50:02,888
and then you'll never hear it,
and you have to.

989
04:50:02,965 --> 04:50:07,868
This is, by far, the dumbest thing
l've ever done in my entire lite.

04:50:07,936 --> 04:50:13,272
So dumb, in faot, that l can't.

l love you.
l've loved you tor nine years.

993
04:50:26,121 --> 04:50:30,455
l've just been too arrogant
and scared to realize it.

994
04:50:30,526 --> 04:50:32,687
Now l'm just scared.

995
04:50:32,761 --> 04:50:36,561
l realize this comes
at a very inopportune time...

996
04:50:36,632 --> 04:50:40,728

favor to ask ot you.

04:52:48,630 --> 04:52:53,226
I have stolen a bread van, and l'm
chasing Michael down Michigan Avenue!

1020
04:52:53,302 --> 04:52:55,668
This is all your tault!

1021
04:52:55,737 --> 04:52:57,671

and l kissed him.

1022
04:52:57,739 --> 04:53:00,333
- Thls is what's happened!
- Jules, a question.

1023
04:53:00,409 --> 04:53:03,572
When you klssed Mlohael,
dld he klss you haok?

1024
04:53:03,645 --> 04:53:05,579
What do you mean?
We were lip to lip!

1025
04:53:05,647 --> 04:53:09,743
Was there anything there leading you
to believe this chase will end happily?

1026
04:53:11,019 --> 04:53:12,953
That's heside the point.
We were interrupted.

1027
04:53:13,021 --> 04:53:15,683
- Who interrupted you?
- Klmmy! She rulned everythlng!

1028
04:53:15,757 --> 04:53:18,191
And Mlohael started chaslng her
belore he could answer me.

1029
04:53:18,260 --> 04:53:19,818
Mlchael's chaslng Klmmy?

1030
04:53:19,895 --> 04:53:21,692
Yo u're chasing Michael?

1031
04:53:21,763 --> 04:53:24,755
Who's chasing you?
Nohody. Get it?

1032
04:53:24,833 --> 04:53:26,323
There's your answer: Klmmy.

1033
04:53:26,401 --> 04:53:28,631
JuIes, you are not the one!

1034
04:53:28,704 --> 04:53:32,765
Now, lor God's sake,
the weddlng is at 6:00 p.m.

1035
04:53:32,841 --> 04:53:36,299
You have a small, but distinct, window
ot opportunity to do the right thing.

1036
04:53:55,097 --> 04:53:57,031
''Exit'' ''Oanal St.''

1037
04:54:09,711 --> 04:54:11,144
All aboard!

1038
04:54:17,686 --> 04:54:19,119
Excuse me.

1039
04:55:18,046 --> 04:55:20,412
l have a confession to make.

1040
04:55:20,482 --> 04:55:22,848
Another contession.

1041
04:55:28,023 --> 04:55:32,858
Besides that l love you,
this is even worse.

1042
04:55:39,634 --> 04:55:43,570
The e-mail that Walter sent
to your boss--

1043
04:55:48,310 --> 04:55:50,301
l wrote that.

1044
04:55:53,415 --> 04:55:56,179
l'm the bad guy.

1045
04:55:57,185 --> 04:55:58,618
Are you orazy?

1046
04:55:58,687 --> 04:56:01,884
Are you completely insane?

1047
04:56:03,091 --> 04:56:06,686
I mean, Jules,
how could you do that?

1048
04:56:08,163 --> 04:56:12,122
lt wasn't supposed
to get sent.

1049
04:56:12,200 --> 04:56:14,498
l just wanted you
to get mad at Kimmy.

1050
04:56:17,873 --> 04:56:19,306
God.

1051
04:56:22,177 --> 04:56:25,544
l have done nothing
but underhanded, despicable...

1052
04:56:25,614 --> 04:56:29,880
not even terribly imaginative things
since l got here.

1053
04:56:38,059 --> 04:56:42,928
l was just trying to win you...

1054
04:56:44,266 --> 04:56:46,791
to win you back.

1055
04:56:47,869 --> 04:56:50,269
But that doesn't excuse
any ot it.

1056
04:56:51,640 --> 04:56:53,130
l'm pond scum.

1057
04:56:55,844 --> 04:56:57,402
Lower, actually.

1058
04:56:57,479 --> 04:57:01,813
l'm like the tungus that feeds
on pond scum.

1059
04:57:01,883 --> 04:57:03,407
Lower.

1060
04:57:06,154 --> 04:57:09,089
The pus that intects the mucus...

1061
04:57:09,157 --> 04:57:13,093
that cruds up the tungus
that teeds on the pond soum.

1062
04:57:21,269 --> 04:57:23,464
On the other hand...

1063
04:57:26,274 --> 04:57:27,707
thank you...

1064
04:57:29,544 --> 04:57:31,739
tor loving me that much.

1065
04:57:32,814 --> 04:57:34,441
That way...

1066
04:57:34,516 --> 04:57:36,450
it's pretty flattering.

1067
04:57:37,986 --> 04:57:40,921
Exoept it makes me tungus.

1068
04:57:41,723 --> 04:57:45,489
That part l knew.

1069
04:57:55,804 --> 04:57:57,237
God.

1070
04:58:01,076 --> 04:58:03,510
l'm glad you didn't get
on that train.

1071
04:58:06,448 --> 04:58:08,609
l oame here looking tor her.

1072
04:58:11,086 --> 04:58:15,386
- Why would she be here?
- This is where l proposed.

1073
04:58:18,493 --> 04:58:22,452
l had to cover a game in Milwaukee,
and she saw me ott.

1074
04:58:22,530 --> 04:58:26,193
The train was starting
to leave and...

1075
04:58:28,036 --> 04:58:31,199
l jumped up on the step
and l held the handle...

1076
04:58:32,274 --> 04:58:34,970
and without...

1077
04:58:35,043 --> 04:58:38,410
a thought in my head,
l just shouted, ''Marry me.''

1078
04:58:40,682 --> 04:58:46,382
The train was pulling out,
and she just suddenly screamed, ''Yes!''

1079
04:58:48,556 --> 04:58:50,080
Just once.

1080
04:58:51,826 --> 04:58:53,760
And blew me a kiss.

1081
04:59:06,308 --> 04:59:08,242
lt would've been
a nice wedding.

1082
04:59:10,679 --> 04:59:13,648
You can't believe
that you've lost her.

1083
04:59:13,715 --> 04:59:18,414
You will tind her, and you'll look
into her eyes and see all that love.

1084
04:59:18,486 --> 04:59:23,287
l just hope that it's soon.
Or else l'd hate to be you at 6:00.

1085
04:59:23,358 --> 04:59:25,258
Just wait.

1086
04:59:25,327 --> 04:59:27,090
We'll split up.

1087
04:59:27,162 --> 04:59:30,757
You will go to every romantic place
the two ot you have...

1088
04:59:30,832 --> 04:59:36,168
and l wilI go someplace brilliant,
and we'll tind her.

1089
04:59:36,237 --> 04:59:38,728
We will tind her.

1090
04:59:42,410 --> 04:59:44,708
Wallaoe egreglous resldence,
Mandy speaklng.

1091
04:59:44,779 --> 04:59:47,145
lt's Jules.
Have you gotten a call lrom Klmmy?

1092
04:59:47,215 --> 04:59:50,309
She slipped out, the little monkey,
during the oommotion.

1093
04:59:50,385 --> 04:59:52,250
''Commotion''?

1094
04:59:52,320 --> 04:59:56,518
My sister was licking an ice sculpture,
and her tongue troze right to it.

1095
04:59:56,591 --> 04:59:58,923
And that's a commotion?

1096
04:59:58,993 --> 05:00:00,927
lt's a sculpture of the David.

1097
05:00:00,995 --> 05:00:02,860
So Kimmy would be--

1098
05:00:02,931 --> 05:00:06,230
She's probably with Michael
doing the nasty.

1099
05:00:06,301 --> 05:00:09,168
Either that or crying in her nachos
down at Oomiskey Park.

1100
05:00:09,237 --> 05:00:11,205
- Exouse me?
- l had this crank call...

1101
05:00:11,272 --> 05:00:13,536
trom some guy who says he saw her
in the luxury box.

1102
05:00:13,608 --> 05:00:16,600
- Right.
- What would a brlde be dolng--

1103
05:00:16,678 --> 05:00:18,612
Can you bring my dress
to the church?

1104
05:00:18,680 --> 05:00:21,342
l have to pick something up
for the oeremony.

1105
05:00:21,416 --> 05:00:23,816
Don't torget to shave now.

1106
05:00:25,754 --> 05:00:27,915
Here we go.
Here's the hair dryer.

1107
05:00:27,989 --> 05:00:29,980
There we go.

1108
05:00:30,058 --> 05:00:33,994
lt's going to be okay.
Please, no pictures.

1109
05:00:37,832 --> 05:00:39,265
''Federal Express''

1110
05:00:52,113 --> 05:00:54,513
l know you're in here.
The guard saw you oome in.

1111
05:00:54,582 --> 05:00:57,346
Just leave me alone,
you bitch!

1112
05:01:03,992 --> 05:01:06,825
Who the hell
do you think you are?

1113
05:01:06,895 --> 05:01:09,261
- Cat fight!
- You came here...

1114
05:01:09,330 --> 05:01:13,198
pretending to he my friend,
and l made you my maid ot honor!

1115
05:01:13,268 --> 05:01:16,863
Who asked you to do that?
You knew me what, eight minutes?

1116
05:01:16,938 --> 05:01:19,532
Michael trusted you,
so l trusted you.

1117
05:01:19,607 --> 05:01:23,270
You wanted to keep me cIose.
You didn't trust me tor a second.

1118
05:01:23,344 --> 05:01:25,744
- l was right!
- Ot course you were right.

1119
05:01:25,814 --> 05:01:28,840
- But that's not my tault.
- You kissed him!

1120
05:01:28,917 --> 05:01:30,851
- At my parents' house!
- That's cold.

1121
05:01:30,919 --> 05:01:32,443
On my wedding daY!

1122
05:01:32,520 --> 05:01:34,249
- Bitch.
- Tramp.

1123
05:01:34,322 --> 05:01:36,256
Shut up!

1124
05:01:36,324 --> 05:01:38,690
Now l love this man,
and there is no way...

1125
05:01:38,760 --> 05:01:44,255
l'm going to give him up to some
two-taced, big-haired tood critic!

1126
05:01:47,869 --> 05:01:50,531
All right.
Okay, all right!

1127
05:01:50,605 --> 05:01:52,038
l kissed him.

1128
05:01:53,508 --> 05:01:56,909
l tried to steal him.

1129
05:02:01,249 --> 05:02:02,682
l lost.

1130
05:02:08,289 --> 05:02:12,885
He doesn't love me.
He loves you.

1131
05:02:19,934 --> 05:02:23,426
l haven't done much that l'm proud ot
the last three days.

1132
05:02:26,841 --> 05:02:30,072
l'd like to take you
to the church...

1133
05:02:30,144 --> 05:02:33,045
so you can walk down
that aisle...

1134
05:02:33,114 --> 05:02:35,605
and marry the man
ot our dreams.

1135
05:02:37,252 --> 05:02:39,777
Because he sure wants
to marry you.

1136
05:04:33,067 --> 05:04:37,868
So ralse our glasses and wish Mlke

tilled with happiness.

1139
05:04:47,749 --> 05:04:51,082
- l guess that's it.
- To the bride and groom.

1140
05:04:57,859 --> 05:05:00,953
Now let's hear from the maid of honor,
the lovely Julianne.

1141
05:05:11,406 --> 05:05:13,772
l had the strangest dream.

1142
05:05:15,510 --> 05:05:20,209
l dreamt that some psychopath was
trying to break the two ot you up.

1143
05:05:26,020 --> 05:05:30,616
Luckily, l woke up and l see...

1144
05:05:32,326 --> 05:05:36,262
that the world
is just as it should be...

1145
05:05:39,634 --> 05:05:41,966

l didn't get you a gitt.

1148
05:06:00,922 --> 05:06:02,190
However,
this is on loan...

1149
05:06:02,190 --> 05:06:05,626
However,
this is on loan...

1150
05:06:08,262 --> 05:06:11,459
until you two
find your song.

1151
05:06:15,670 --> 05:06:18,901
Someday

1152
05:06:20,875 --> 05:06:24,038
When l'm awlully low

1153
05:06:25,246 --> 05:06:28,272
When the world ls cold

1154
05:06:29,884 --> 05:06:33,149

1155
05:06:33,221 --> 05:06:38,921

1171

Good glrl.

Just give me 30, 35 years.

1176
05:09:20,788 --> 05:09:22,517
The mlsery...

1177
05:09:22,590 --> 05:09:24,057
the exqulslte tragedy.

1178
05:09:24,125 --> 05:09:27,026

05:09:32,266 --> 05:09:35,326
Halr swept up.
Haven't touched your cake.

05:09:35,403 --> 05:09:39,703
Probably drummlng your llngernalls
on the whlte llnen tablecloth...

1183
05:09:39,774 --> 05:09:41,867
the way you do when you're
really leellng down.

1184
05:09:41,943 --> 05:09:45,379
Perhaps looklng at those nails thlnklng:

1185
05:09:45,446 --> 05:09:49,007
my evll plottlng to have that manioure,

1186
05:09:49,083 --> 05:09:52,712
l didn't tell you
my dress was lavender.

1187
05:09:52,787 --> 05:09:54,778
Suddenly, a lamlllar song.

1188
05:09:54,855 --> 05:09:58,222
The moment l wake up

1189
05:09:59,927 --> 05:10:02,953
And you're oll your ohalr
ln one, exqulslte movement...

1190
05:10:05,666 --> 05:10:08,829
wonderlng, searchlng,
snllllng the wlnd...

1191
05:10:08,903 --> 05:10:11,337
like a dapple deer.

1192
05:10:11,405 --> 05:10:13,464
Has God heard your llttle prayer?

1193
05:10:13,541 --> 05:10:16,101
Wlll Clnderella dance agaln?

1194
05:10:16,177 --> 05:10:20,375
And then, suddenly,
the orowds part...

1195
05:10:22,083 --> 05:10:23,516
and there he ls:

1196
05:10:24,852 --> 05:10:27,878
sleek, stylish...

1197
05:10:27,955 --> 05:10:30,651
radlant with charisma.

1198
05:10:30,725 --> 05:10:33,785
Blzarrely,
he's on the telephone.

1199
05:10:33,861 --> 05:10:36,421
But then, so are you.

1200
05:10:38,899 --> 05:10:40,924
And he comes towards you...

1201
05:10:42,203 --> 05:10:44,137
the moves ol a jungle cat.

1202
05:10:45,373 --> 05:10:47,773
Although you qulte oorrectly sense

1203
05:10:49,143 --> 05:10:50,701

1204
05:10:50,778 --> 05:10:54,305

1205
05:10:56,050 --> 05:10:59,076

1206
05:11:00,921 --> 05:11:03,321
lite goes on.

1207
05:11:03,391 --> 05:11:06,019
Mayhe there won't be marriage.

1208
05:11:06,093 --> 05:11:08,288
Maybe there won't be sex.

1209
05:11:09,630 --> 05:11:13,464
But, by God,
there'll be dancing.

1210
05:11:32,019 --> 05:11:34,351
Bond. Jane Bond.

1211
05:11:39,160 --> 05:11:41,390
