1
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:58,658
"I have got the treasure of love."

2
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:05,931
"I have got the treasure of love."

3
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:13,070
"My guru gave me
this invaluable gift."

4
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:17,205
"I accepted it gratefully."

5
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:24,017
"I have got the treasure of love."

6
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:31,529
"I have got the treasure of love."

7
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,375
Here you go son of Dashrath...

8
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,379
...take your bow.

9
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:55,115
Chaubey sir,
a humble request...

10
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,277
...kind|y give me a new bow.

11
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,551
This breaks
when I pull it...

12
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,523
...then I've to stop the play
and glue it.

13
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,162
Who told you to pull it like
Lord Rama?

14
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:05,093
Adjust!

15
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:06,995
Help boss!

16
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,962
These shoes
are tight!

17
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,399
The nails hurt!

18
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:14,027
Instead of laughing in the
scene they make me cry!

19
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:17,939
The actor who played
Ravan before you...

20
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:21,075
...had a smaller shoe size.
So what can I do?

21
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:22,875
Inflation is on a rise.

22
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,449
If I had bought new shoes for you
I couldn't have afforded food...

23
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,815
and we would've had
to eat your shoes for dinner.

24
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,717
You also adjust!

25
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,115
Once Prem Dilwala...

26
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,489
...finds out about
all this...

27
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,462
...he will "adjust" boss!

28
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:41,161
We'll begin our play...

29
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,497
...with the scene where...

30
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,999
...Sita is picking
flowers in the garden!

31
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:19,631
Let's have some rocking songs!

32
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,311
Brothen.

33
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:35,150
Glory to Lord Rama!

34
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,653
Glory to Lord Hanuman!

35
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:40,191
Glory to all the saints!

36
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,487
Glory to all the devotees!

37
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:45,860
Glory to Lord Rama!

38
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:47,756
Some use their hands well...

39
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,101
...whi|e some use their feet.

40
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,533
But I use both well!

41
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,405
Where are you going?

42
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,607
Who narrates Rama's story here?

43
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,145
You, Mr. Prem.

44
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:04,038
Me...

45
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:09,716
...and what do I do before
I start narrating?

46
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,581
You make a grand entry.

47
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:20,254
And right before my entry you
were misbehaving, that too with Sita!

48
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,898
Sorry my mistake.

49
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:23,457
Pardon me Lord...

50
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:29,963
...but if anyone tries to
disrupt your beautiful tale...

51
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:34,812
...it makes your devotee very angry!

52
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,547
Glory to Lord Hanuman!

53
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:05,374
"Let there be an uproar
that shocks the neighbor."

54
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:08,845
"Let us glorify compassion."

55
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,922
"A story of Rama and Sita
and propriety and modesty."

56
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:22,289
"Teaching the way of love."

57
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:25,995
"The girl and the guy
will both |earn."

58
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:32,665
"The girl and the guy
will both |earn.."

59
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,262
"..Ram and Sita's unique.."

60
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:43,105
"..|ove story."

61
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,643
We next move on to King Janak's court...

62
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:51,082
...where Lord Rama
is sitting with a smile.

63
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:55,320
Ravan is proudly...
staring at the bow!

64
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:59,296
And then he arrogantly steps forward!

65
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:18,240
"Silly is the Ruler of Lanka
to stare at women."

66
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:22,879
"Silly is the Ruler of Lanka
to stare at women."

67
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:26,254
"Get your dirty mind off Janaki."

68
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:29,350
"Get your dirty mind off Janaki."

69
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,828
"Be ashamed of your deeds."

70
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:36,459
"Ravan, you better
leave this place."

71
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:40,266
"Why are you angry?"

72
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:46,437
"Why are you angry?"

73
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:49,969
"Ram and Sita's unique.."

74
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:56,453
"..|ove story."

75
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:09,000
"Meeting between Sita and Rama
was similar to Radha and Shyam."

76
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,694
"Meeting between Sita and Rama
was similar to Radha and Shyam."

77
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,071
"Love is easy to get."

78
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,167
"Love is easy to get."

79
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:23,578
"Listen Chotu, Bhappu,
Raju, Gopal, and Gappu..."

80
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,208
"...you too will meet
the princess of your dreams."

81
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:30,652
"It could be
Meena, Rajjo, or Sheela."

82
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,223
"It could be
Meena, Rajjo, or Sheela."

83
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,829
"Don't you see it?"

84
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:47,532
"It's a love story."

85
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:04,846
Prem Bhaiya (Brother),
I still can't understand why you...

86
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,719
Our town's unrecognized actor...

87
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,656
why are you still
talking like a woman?

88
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,694
You're not playing Sita anymore.

89
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,328
You make me so angry!

90
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:16,094
What is it about Uphaar Foundation...

91
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,965
that once again you're
donating all your earnings to it?

92
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,366
Uphaar Foundation is run by....

93
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:24,904
....Princess Maithili of Devgarh.

94
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,255
Ma'am, I know that the
Princess is in Delhi these days.

95
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,391
She has a big fashion boutique there.

96
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,361
Very good!

97
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:00,097
But when is she coming back?

98
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,867
She was here last year...

99
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:05,499
on Sunday,
20th September at 3:30pm.

100
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,874
She came in her flying chariot.
I remember.

101
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:11,381
I don't know when
she's coming here next.

102
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,611
But next week, she's
coming to Pritampur!

103
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,714
Pritampur!

104
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:21,320
It's only a day's journey from here.

105
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:25,351
The Princess is engaged to
Vijay Singh, the Prince of Pritampur.

106
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,954
And next week is
the Prince's coronation...

107
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,967
...she will definitely
attend that!

108
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,796
Why don't you meet her there?

109
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:36,596
She won't meet me.

110
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,331
Of course she will.

111
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:39,876
And when you do meet her....

112
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,913
...give your donation
box to her personally.

113
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,743
She'll be really happy.

114
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:45,713
Okay.

115
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:49,052
Why don't you come along too?
For moral support!

116
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,054
I won't go.

117
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:52,520
I won't...

118
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,786
Who's even asking you?

119
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:58,226
You're my compulsory companion!

120
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,456
Let's Pritampur. . . rrrrrrr !

121
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,838
Your Highness,
the estate of Pritampur...

122
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:22,251
...that you'll be inheriting from
the Late King, it's rather expensive.

123
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:24,754
I've heard it's worth billions.

124
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,456
Should I put it at...

125
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,154
...|et me not give it a figure.

126
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,385
It's wow!

127
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,323
How do you feel?

128
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:33,922
I feel blessed.

129
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,898
Your Prime Minister,
Deewan Saheb, was saying that...

130
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:39,334
...guests from all over the world
will be attending your coronation.

131
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:41,804
The entire estate will be decorated...

132
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:45,434
...and you'll be crowned
with pomp and show.

133
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:48,068
By the way, in today's times....

134
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:51,081
..."si||y" is not the word, but...
I do find it funny.

135
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,480
What do you say?

136
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,281
You think traditions are funny?

137
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,552
No, I...

138
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,749
Is this clown here to waste my time?

139
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:02,959
Sir.

140
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,523
Excuse me!

141
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,660
Following our traditions...

142
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,497
...is more important to
me than being the King.

143
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:12,399
Next.

144
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:15,368
So on that day we'll
see you in royal attire...

145
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:21,238
...armed with the royal sword, riding
an elephant amongst an army of horses?

146
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:22,645
Yes.

147
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:25,080
That day no one in
Pritampur will need to cook.

148
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,042
Every resident...

149
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:29,552
...Every resident will be a royal guest.

150
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:32,282
We'll decorate this
palace like a bride.

151
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:33,790
There'|| be fireworks.

152
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,456
Everyone will be chanting one thing...

153
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,518
"Glory to King Vijay Singh!"

154
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:41,394
Not Vijay Singh..."G|ory to Pritampur!"

155
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,430
Get my fencing gear
ready for tomorrow.

156
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,897
That was close Ajay.
Very good!

157
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,312
Ow, Bhaisaheb (Elder Brother)...
- Bhaisaheb wins!

158
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,950
Happy Holi!

159
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:44,859
You rascal...

160
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:47,959
Bhaisaheb...no!

161
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:57,339
Well done Princes!

162
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:03,942
No!

163
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:04,773
Yes.

164
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:07,443
No, no...no is good, sir. No is fine.

165
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:08,915
You guys were brilliant.

166
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:11,683
Yes!

167
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,222
Thank God sir...

168
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,094
Thank God this wasn't a
real competition between you two...

169
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:22,997
...and just a practice.

170
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,163
Thank you.

171
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,964
Sir, this friendly match...

172
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,402
...wi|| greatly entertain...

173
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:30,565
...the guests at the coronation.

174
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,973
What do you say?
- Not bad.

175
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:35,069
Your Highness, Princess Maithili
has sent her confirmation.

176
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:38,012
She'll be arriving in Pritampur
on Friday by the 2 o'clock train.

177
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:40,915
We'll have to make
security arrangements.

178
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:44,079
Who will be going
to the station to receive her?

179
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,053
Bhaisaheb first.

180
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:50,652
Bhaisaheb, I'm going to organize
a bouquet of 1,000 red roses.

181
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,456
P|ease...take it with a smile.

182
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,490
Tell him.

183
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:54,964
Superb sir.

184
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:55,999
Thank you.

185
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,795
I think I'll avoid it.

186
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,767
Because when people see us together...

187
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,430
...they start blessing us oddly.

188
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:06,499
Your Highness, as per tradition...

189
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:10,373
.. .your sisters should
go to receive the Princess.

190
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:27,393
After mom passed away,
whenever I missed her as a child...

191
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,324
...father used to say...

192
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:32,926
‘You're not alone Vijay,
you have two more mothers...‘

193
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,062
'...Ajay's mother..'

194
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:36,036
'...Chandrika and Radhika's mother.‘

195
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:39,837
‘You're very fortunate
to have such a big family.‘

196
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,434
Fortunate?

197
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,573
We're all living separately,
aloof from each other.

198
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:47,550
Because of our common activities,
I sometimes speak to Ajay.

199
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,812
But my sisters...

200
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,554
...I wonder what they have against me.

201
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:54,488
The King wanted you
to keep the family united.

202
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,083
I did what I could...

203
00:16:56,148 --> 00:17:00,255
...but if my sisters don't respond,
then I can't go any further!

204
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:09,265
When family members fall apart...

205
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:12,500
...it takes almost a lifetime
to bring them together.

206
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:15,645
But should we stop trying?

207
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:25,882
Let's try again.

208
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,886
I'll inform Chandrika and Radhika...

209
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:32,930
...that the Prince is
coming to meet them tomorrow.

210
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:36,495
We'll go in the same royal carriage...

211
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:40,436
...in which you played
together as children.

212
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,933
We'll request them...

213
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:47,375
...to receive their would-be
sister-in-law at the station.

214
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,901
Have a seat, I'll call her.

215
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:22,536
Chandrika!

216
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,742
Chandrika!

217
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,873
Greetings.
- Mr. Bhandari, you? Here?

218
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,207
Princess Chandrika called me.

219
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:06,823
As the royal family's lawyer she wants
me to understand why you're here...

220
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,617
..and then she'll meet you.

221
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,257
She'll meet you...

222
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:17,530
It's not what you think Mr. Bhandari.

223
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:20,265
A brother's here to
meet his younger sisters.

224
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,597
It's a bit personal.

225
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,899
I'll meet her myself.

226
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,243
Chandrika.

227
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,977
Whatever we discuss will
be in front of the lawyer.

228
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:32,945
Chanda!

229
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,382
Enough!

230
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:44,525
Your Highness!

231
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,724
Chandrika! Chandri...

232
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:47,791
Your Highness!

233
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:50,991
Chuttan, let's go!

234
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:10,480
I went there as per your advice
Deewan Saheb, and that was my mistake.

235
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:14,455
If this is what family's like,
then every one's better-off alone!

236
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:54,885
Chuttan!

237
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:34,355
We've arrived in Pritampur!

238
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,289
No we haven't reached Pritampur yet...

239
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,954
...there's a 30 minute halt
to eat food or use the washroom.

240
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,357
30 minutes?
- Go on! Get it over with.

241
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:41,157
Sit.

242
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,130
Does anyone want to use the washroom?
- No!

243
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:46,499
No, right?
Driver, let's be on our way...quick|y.

244
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:47,865
What's the hurry?

245
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,439
Will you find your bride there?

246
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:53,508
Not a bride, a Goddess...
to whom he'll make an offering.

247
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,545
Taunting tone but the right answer.

248
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:59,477
Son, won't you buy fruits
and flowers to honour the Goddess?

249
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:07,619
"My heart beats fast."

250
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:12,590
"My heart is racing."

251
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:31,907
"I have to meet her today."

252
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:37,216
"I have to meet her today."

253
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:42,919
"Let me take a gift for her.
Let me thank her."

254
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:48,728
"Let me take snacks and sweets."

255
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:54,561
"I have to meet her today."

256
00:24:54,627 --> 00:25:00,077
"I have to meet her today."

257
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:32,332
So many medicines?
Is someone really unwell?

258
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:34,108
Yes.

259
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:51,592
"She's a princess, beautiful, smart
and of a respectable family."

260
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:57,259
"It's difficult to choose
a token of my love."

261
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:05,771
"She's a princess, beautiful, smart
and of a respectable family."

262
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:11,782
"It's difficult to choose
a token of my love."

263
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:19,580
"Let me buy various
kinds of snacks."

264
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:25,288
"Something spicy and
something bitter and sour."

265
00:26:25,718 --> 00:26:31,327
"I have to meet her today."

266
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:36,771
"I have to meet her today."

267
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:46,682
"My heart beats fast."

268
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,815
"My heart is racing."

269
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:58,319
"My heart beats fast."

270
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:02,391
Only one watermelon for the Princess?

271
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:05,425
Is someone else also buying
the entire market like us?

272
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:10,698
Yes...the rest of the watermelons
have been bought by that gentleman...

273
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:15,910
...he's the head security officer
of the Pritampur royal family.

274
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,652
No I don't want anything.

275
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:45,571
Thank you sir.

276
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,405
Have some guava, really sweet.

277
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:53,649
Sorry sir. I didn't have
any other way to impress you.

278
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:57,385
Please, arrange a small
meeting with the Princess.

279
00:27:57,743 --> 00:27:59,313
We've come from really far...

280
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:03,291
...facing many difficulties
to meet Princess Maithili.

281
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,992
Sir, just a brief meeting.

282
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,430
Yes, of course.
I'll arrange a meeting for you.

283
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:13,601
We Pritampur dwellers
take good care of our guests.

284
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:14,530
Come.

285
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,804
In the car?

286
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:18,365
I'll get our luggage...

287
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,407
Bhaiji (Sir)...
I love you, Bhaiji!

288
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:30,219
Even Kanhaiya has
never loved me so much.

289
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:33,082
So Bhaiji what can we show you?

290
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:35,785
The plays of Chota Bheem,
Bal Hanuman...

291
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:37,985
...or the Ladies‘ Special...
Jai Santoshi Maa!

292
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:41,321
No...do you have a CD or something?
- Yes, of course.

293
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,694
We do have a CD.
- We do have a CD.

294
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:46,928
We'll show him the
best one...how about this?

295
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:49,528
No...I had a viral during
the performance.

296
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:53,473
This is our interpretation
of Vrindavan's ‘Raas-Leela‘ for you.

297
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:54,840
I'm not interested.

298
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,606
No, Bhaiyaji,
you'll have to watch it.

299
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:59,410
For the sake of your mother...
for the sake of your cow!

300
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,781
For the sake of the
milkman that milks the cow!

301
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,759
What a view!

302
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:15,092
The Maharaja must
have had great vision!

303
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:17,030
This is our royal fort.

304
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,702
Take a seat and I'll arrange
for your stay.

305
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,737
Yes we'll sit.

306
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:25,270
Sir will we get an attached bathroom?

307
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,675
No it's okay. There are fields
and va||eys...it's natural.

308
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:30,714
All we need is cold
water for bathing...

309
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,045
...it keeps the body
contract and strong.

310
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:36,585
And hot water for drinking.
- For voice and bowel movement...

311
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:37,651
Yes.

312
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:39,450
You'll get 24 hours room service too.

313
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:42,023
Love you Bhaiji.
- Sir how about a demonstration?

314
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,150
"Radha said..."

315
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:45,821
No I don't want to see anything.
I've some work.

316
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:46,655
I'll be right back.

317
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:48,664
No problem, you go freshen up.

318
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,030
We'll recreate Vrindavan
for you right here.

319
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:28,063
Sir...
- Not now. Give the packet.

320
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:38,708
Doctor if you need any other
equipment or anything else...

321
00:30:38,904 --> 00:30:40,577
...it'|| be arranged immediately.

322
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:42,980
Nothing should happen to the Prince.

323
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:52,058
Only a handful of us
are left of the Late King's...

324
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:53,528
trustworthy people.

325
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:58,164
The future of this
family lies in your hands.

326
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:02,265
You arrived at the accident spot
at the right time...

327
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:03,669
...thus he survived.

328
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,468
Otherwise such a fatal attack!

329
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:11,171
His survival is the result
of everyone's prayers.

330
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:15,584
Why didn't we take him
to the hospital, with security?

331
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:19,717
When our dear ones cross
all limits of humanity...

332
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:22,092
...then no security can do anything.

333
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,686
When's the coronation?

334
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:26,295
In four days.

335
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:28,361
The King decided this date...

336
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,696
...according to astrology,
on his death bed.

337
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,597
It can be inauspicious to postpone it.

338
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:37,366
Doctor it's a case of cerebral
concussion with cerebral edema.

339
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,942
These wounds on his
body will heal soon.

340
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,405
But he's suffered
internal head injuries.

341
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,140
But don't worry...

342
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:51,578
...there are signs of recovery.

343
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:53,181
Thank you doctor.

344
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:58,321
No one should know that
the Prince has been kept here.

345
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:38,224
"Let's go give Radha a visit."

346
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:42,599
"Let's go give Radha a visit."

347
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:46,540
"Let's go color Radha."

348
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:50,444
"Delicate little Radha
is shy of Kanha."

349
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:54,583
"Lets the lover
only a glimpse of her beauty."

350
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:58,086
"A shiver runs up her spine."

351
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:01,852
"Let's go."

352
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:05,690
"Let's go give Radha a visit."

353
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:09,493
"Let's go."

354
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:26,616
Sir, you've always said that
God helps those in great trouble.

355
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:34,520
"Kisna has taken a liking to
your fair complexion, Radha."

356
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:39,653
"He wonders
how to color you during Holi."

357
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:41,696
"Let's go."

358
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:42,891
What are you trying to say?

359
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:44,558
Sir the Prince survived this time....

360
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:48,799
...but we still don't know
who's behind this fatal attack.

361
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:52,865
If he can attack once,
he can attack again.

362
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:59,847
The Prince can only remain safe here,
when there's another Prince out there!

363
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:01,509
Is this the time to joke?

364
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,016
Send those two clowns
back immediately!

365
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:10,115
Yes Your Majesty?

366
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:13,524
Deewan Saheb,
Maithili and I've been trying...

367
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:17,465
...to call the Prince since a while,
but his phone's switched off.

368
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,032
Maybe he's busy.

369
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:22,928
We've received
the Princess‘ schedule...

370
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,202
...we'|| all be there to receive her.

371
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,908
Congratulations to all of you!

372
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,677
Thank you.

373
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,015
Guests will be arriving
from all over the world...

374
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:39,487
...a|ong with national
and international media.

375
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:43,651
What will we tell the Princess
and these people about the Prince?

376
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,861
And how?

377
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,836
Prem Bhaiya?

378
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:07,274
Did you ever hear that
the King visited our place? - No.

379
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:10,251
Did mom ever visit
this kingdom? - No.

380
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,821
It's all mom's fault...
he could have been your brother today!

381
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:18,521
It's just a coincidence that
you two look alike. Nothing more.

382
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,933
I've heard that you're
a very good actor.

383
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,294
Are you hesitating?

384
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:26,563
Hesitating?

385
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:32,633
Bapu (Unc|e)...if we decide to imitate
you, even your wife will get confused.

386
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:37,771
The point is that he wants
me to pose as the Princess‘ fiance...

387
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:38,871
...for four days!

388
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:42,908
And four days also include four
nights! What are you talking Bapu?

389
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:44,453
He'll wake up right?

390
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:47,046
Or then Prem Bhaiya and
she might end up getting married.

391
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:48,113
Shut up!

392
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:52,487
Don't you understand
the gravity of the situation?

393
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:55,155
It's a matter of the
Prince's life and death.

394
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:59,933
Bapu we refuse to
deceive our Princess.

395
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:03,164
Bapu has no maturity.
Let's go!

396
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,899
You're not deceiving her.

397
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:09,536
In fact you're protecting her fiance!

398
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:14,376
What if the Princess‘
fiance’ is attacked again?

399
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:17,017
What will she go through?

400
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:24,953
How much money will you charge?

401
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,091
Immature Bapu!

402
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,597
This is our Princess‘ future home.

403
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:32,794
It's a matter of our pride and honour!

404
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,463
There's no question of money!

405
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:44,112
Keep a straight face! Sit straight!

406
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,887
Bapu!

407
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:56,257
When you have
Dashrath's experience...

408
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:58,453
...why are you getting
impatient like young Laxman?

409
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,587
Let young India work too.

410
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,723
Don't you dare touch anything
of the royal household.

411
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:07,196
You've a role to play here as well...

412
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:09,939
...your role is of
a senior photographer.

413
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:12,474
Who's come here
for the coronation.

414
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,339
You've been trying to create a book...

415
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:16,708
...of all the royal family
pictures since 1970.

416
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,337
The beard is fine, so are the clothes.

417
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,776
But you haven't thought of a name yet.

418
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:21,715
You're such a useless writer.

419
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:25,152
It's the height of naivety. If Masoorie
uncle was alive, he would've slapped you.

420
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,587
But I'll think of something.

421
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:28,181
I found a name!

422
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:29,257
Naadaan Masoorie.

423
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:31,418
I told you I'll think of something.

424
00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:34,258
I've got it. Naadaan Masoorie!

425
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:37,090
Why aren't you wearing your shoes?

426
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:38,896
Put them on me.

427
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:43,872
I'm not allowed to touch anything
of the royal household, right?

428
00:37:45,397 --> 00:37:47,934
Bapu!
- Leave me!

429
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,879
Bapu! There should be
some give and take in life.

430
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:55,782
If you've given me the Prince's role,
give me the freedom to live like him.

431
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,514
Get that blue book
from the book shelf.

432
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,819
Oh come on Bapu is
this a job for a Prince?

433
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:03,324
Here's your book.

434
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:04,621
What the...

435
00:38:06,551 --> 00:38:07,825
Masoorie!

436
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,997
Have a look Masoorie...

437
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:11,557
Listen carefully!

438
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:13,497
When you pull the blue book out...

439
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:16,470
...it opens this secret
door into the Prince's office.

440
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:19,298
One of us will be here 24 hours a day.

441
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,809
If there's any emergency,
come inside immediately.

442
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:22,640
Follow me!

443
00:38:22,701 --> 00:38:24,908
I said, follow me!

444
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,677
Now you'll be shown
a DVD of the Prince.

445
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:31,744
Observe his style
and the way he speaks.

446
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:36,791
Look Masoorie,
all our dreams have come true.

447
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:40,495
Sir, let them eat something first.

448
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:44,399
They can do anything
while watching the video.

449
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:47,529
‘I'm so happy you guys are here!‘

450
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:50,033
‘Love you guys!
Thank you!‘

451
00:38:51,196 --> 00:38:52,800
Due to weak digestion...

452
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:54,434
...the Prince eats only boiled food.

453
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:58,476
What's the point of being a Prince if
he eats only green stuff...hea|th freak!

454
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:00,516
He's like a goat!

455
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,409
From tomorrow you'll
get only boiled food.

456
00:39:02,474 --> 00:39:03,680
Bapu.
- Shut up!

457
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:04,719
Bapu.
- Shut up!

458
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:05,651
Ba...
- Shut...

459
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,620
'"-Du___
‘um

460
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:13,118
(Speaks French)

461
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:16,089
The Prince speaks many languages.

462
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:18,928
He speaks French,
Italian and German fluently.

463
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:23,598
A...aa...e...ee...u...uu.
- Well said!

464
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:28,274
You don't need to overact for this.
- Overact?

465
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:32,337
We'll declare that the Prince is observing
a vow of silence for the next four days.

466
00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:37,480
These are the Prince's step-sisters...

467
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,351
...Princess Chandrika...

468
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:41,354
...Princess Radhika.

469
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:50,397
This is that driver Chuttan who took
the royal carriage to the mountains.

470
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:52,828
The day we lay our hands on him...

471
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:56,963
...we'|| prove that this conspiracy
was planned by these people.

472
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:00,001
The Prince's step-brother, Ajay Singh.

473
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,805
The Prince's secretary, Sameera.

474
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,408
The Prince's distant relative...

475
00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:07,848
...and the estate's CEO,
the cunning Chirag Singh.

476
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:16,355
Bhaisaheb's flag is still up.

477
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:18,824
This means he's still alive.

478
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,590
Don't worry sir.

479
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:26,225
We'll soon find out where
Deewan Saheb has hidden him.

480
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:30,598
And anyway,
after falling from such a height...

481
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:33,470
...he's probably even
having difficulty breathing.

482
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:47,785
This beautiful lady from
the 1940s is now yours.

483
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,259
And for the one who told me...

484
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:55,593
...that Bhaisaheb is going to
meet the sisters without any security.

485
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:59,226
For her...this evergreen girl.

486
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:01,335
Thank you sir!

487
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:04,373
You've a big heart, sir...very big.

488
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:08,310
You've done the big thing
by planning this accident, Chirag.

489
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,546
You've liberated me.

490
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:14,509
You're lucky you don't
have an elder brother...

491
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:16,242
...to whom you're always compared.

492
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:23,457
And papa passed away...

493
00:41:23,882 --> 00:41:28,956
...but decided that his elder
son will pass all my bills.

494
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,429
Only then can I survive.

495
00:41:31,723 --> 00:41:34,260
And what did the elder son do?

496
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:39,499
He rejected every bill,
like one does with contractors!

497
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:43,138
Today for the first time
I have given something

498
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:44,606
...without his permission.

499
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:47,313
EHJTJV!

500
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:57,483
Sir, if the younger prince finds out...

501
00:41:57,582 --> 00:42:01,029
...that his elder brother
passed all his bills...

502
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:03,357
...and it was you...?

503
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:07,828
Sameera, these Kings don't have time...

504
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:11,200
...to check every cheque
book and voucher.

505
00:42:11,396 --> 00:42:13,273
That's our job.

506
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:19,105
We can shake the very
foundation of these palaces.

507
00:42:19,804 --> 00:42:21,681
And this is just the
beginning of my plan...

508
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:24,345
...and your gifts, Sameera.

509
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:27,390
Let's take a nice picture of you...

510
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:28,985
...come on!
- Okay.

511
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:37,789
Yes, sir.

512
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:41,593
Bhaisaheb has ordered to make arrangements
to welcome the Princess tomorrow.

513
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:44,799
He's personally going to the
station tomorrow to receive her.

514
00:42:44,963 --> 00:42:47,239
How's it possible? Huh?

515
00:42:50,602 --> 00:42:52,309
The Prince will be here soon.

516
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:55,317
I'll find out everything
and inform you Chirag sir.

517
00:42:55,473 --> 00:42:57,043
Sameera.
-Yeah?

518
00:42:57,208 --> 00:43:00,155
I want to introduce you to a special guest.
- Oh! Yes, yes!

519
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:01,757
Come.
- Please.

520
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:04,388
Hello, dear.

521
00:43:04,649 --> 00:43:07,391
Sameera, the Prince's orders are...

522
00:43:07,485 --> 00:43:11,865
...that you'll look after Mr. Masoorie
until the coronation.

523
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:16,329
His travel arrangements, comfortable
stay...that's your responsibility.

524
00:43:16,561 --> 00:43:18,837
But the Prince didn't
tell me anything.

525
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:21,433
He told me...to tell you.

526
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:22,736
Okay.

527
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:28,910
Sameera...a camera stand for
Mr. Masoorie, please.

528
00:43:29,908 --> 00:43:30,909
Right away.

529
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:32,144
Of course.

530
00:43:35,413 --> 00:43:38,121
Why are you involving
me with this girl?

531
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:40,355
Don't you see I've immersed
in my character?

532
00:43:40,418 --> 00:43:44,389
Look, don't let Sameera
anywhere near Prem Dilwala.

533
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:46,162
What if she gets suspicious?

534
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,797
But...

535
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:53,604
Consider this a part of your role.
- This? How?

536
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:56,042
You've heard of love?
- Hmmm.

537
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,478
That's what you feel for her.

538
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:02,812
You've fit this angle of love
nicely in this story.

539
00:44:02,874 --> 00:44:03,716
WOW!

540
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:06,552
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

541
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,250
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

542
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:11,555
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

543
00:44:11,616 --> 00:44:13,994
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

544
00:44:14,085 --> 00:44:16,292
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

545
00:44:16,354 --> 00:44:18,459
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

546
00:44:23,428 --> 00:44:26,068
The Princess is arriving.
Concentrate!

547
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,675
I know.

548
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,507
Do Bapu and Mrs. Bapu always fight?
He's always sullen.

549
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,843
He isn't married.

550
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:36,576
You mean virgin Bapu!

551
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:39,548
You're observing a vow of silence,
keep your mouth shut!

552
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:41,154
Give this to the Princess.

553
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:42,324
sanjav!

554
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,354
The Princess!

555
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:15,920
"I wonder what I would say
when I meet her."

556
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:21,623
"I might say that I look up to her."

557
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:29,868
"I wonder what I would say
when I meet her."

558
00:45:30,161 --> 00:45:35,702
"I might say that I look up to her."

559
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:41,878
Long live the Princess!

560
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:43,346
Give the flowers.

561
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:48,150
Not to me, to the Princess!

562
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:22,118
I hope you had a comfortable journey.

563
00:46:22,413 --> 00:46:24,086
Yes...thank you.

564
00:46:24,315 --> 00:46:25,817
How are you?

565
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:27,325
All okay.

566
00:46:27,685 --> 00:46:29,130
How's grandma?

567
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:30,597
She's fine.

568
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,927
In fact she also wanted to come...

569
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:36,233
...but couldn't
due to her knee problem.

570
00:46:37,028 --> 00:46:39,304
She sends her love.

571
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:43,274
The Prince is observing
a vow of silence for a few days.

572
00:46:43,568 --> 00:46:44,876
Vow of silence?

573
00:46:45,069 --> 00:46:49,848
He says that people observe
a vow of silence for inner peace.

574
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:52,547
He has his own ways!

575
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:04,832
By the way,
the Prince is allowed to hum.

576
00:47:06,457 --> 00:47:09,563
We've made arrangements for
your stay at the royal guest house...

577
00:47:09,627 --> 00:47:13,006
...but before that you'll have
lunch with the Prince at the palace.

578
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,507
Serve properly,
there shouldn't be any mistakes.

579
00:47:18,603 --> 00:47:22,141
And the Prince shouldn't
break his vow of silence.

580
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:30,115
Thank you.

581
00:48:13,925 --> 00:48:17,737
I'm sorry, but
I can't take this any longer.

582
00:48:18,963 --> 00:48:23,002
I've been a self-confident
girl all my life.

583
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:26,646
But for the first time
I'm losing my bearings.

584
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:30,717
I need to know
where I'm going wrong.

585
00:48:34,779 --> 00:48:37,726
Your Highness, we've been
engaged for five months...

586
00:48:37,782 --> 00:48:42,527
and we've hardly communicated
more than five times!

587
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,967
I know you're not
ready for this marriage...

588
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:49,129
...and you couldn't go against
the Late King's orders.

589
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,763
You're already burdened
with a lot of responsibilities...

590
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:54,207
...and you don't want
to add another one.

591
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:57,744
Especially, when there's already
so much tension in the family.

592
00:48:58,035 --> 00:49:02,279
I understand that those
who are independent-minded...

593
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,319
...don't like to be bossed around.

594
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:07,280
But is this fair?

595
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:13,988
If we want to spend our lives together,
we can't live like strangers.

596
00:49:14,485 --> 00:49:20,595
I can't live in fear, not knowing
when you'll get angry or yell at me.

597
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:27,037
I always wanted people around us...

598
00:49:27,098 --> 00:49:29,305
...so that a scene isn't created.

599
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,076
I don't even know you.

600
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:35,944
Your Highness...

601
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:41,354
...if you're not happy,
then we can go our separate ways.

602
00:49:41,512 --> 00:49:43,082
I'm happy in Delhi.

603
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:46,424
Uphaar Foundation
and my business keep me busy.

604
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:49,691
I'll make grandma understand,
no problem.

605
00:49:50,121 --> 00:49:54,035
I didn't even know that
you're observing a vow of silence.

606
00:49:58,596 --> 00:50:00,075
I'm sorry.

607
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,270
But it's your mistake

608
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,076
...and you'll agree with me.

609
00:50:07,138 --> 00:50:10,119
You never expressed
your feelings to me.

610
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:12,120
Because if you had,
then I would've listened...

611
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:14,349
...and if I'd listened,
I would've appreciated it...

612
00:50:14,412 --> 00:50:16,016
...and understood.

613
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:18,250
So...how do I make up for this?

614
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:22,024
Will you finish this, or should
I order a special watermelon for you?

615
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:24,656
What about your vow
of silence for inner peace?

616
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:25,961
Vow of silence!

617
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:30,438
You see...a great scholar
Baba Prem told me...

618
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:33,668
...that until you don't
spread happiness in the world...

619
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:36,243
...you can't attain inner peace.

620
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,007
You want to know my secrets?

621
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:39,978
My highs, my lows...

622
00:50:40,071 --> 00:50:42,142
mm‘! UPS, my downs?

623
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:43,514
Give me a minute.

624
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:45,219
Deewan...

625
00:50:45,843 --> 00:50:47,220
...Saheb!

626
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:50,622
What's wrong, your Highness?

627
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:54,090
You took a vow of silence!

628
00:50:54,185 --> 00:50:57,098
I decided to break it.

629
00:50:57,421 --> 00:50:58,832
Does not matter.

630
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,460
We need to show the
Princess "those-those" places...

631
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,800
...where I spent my childhood.

632
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:06,802
Please make the arrangements.

633
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,546
Move it!

634
00:51:11,936 --> 00:51:13,108
Move it?

635
00:51:17,608 --> 00:51:19,918
The Prince studied in this
school till 8th grade.

636
00:51:19,977 --> 00:51:21,979
This school was built in 1907.

637
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,424
It's architecture was believed
to be very modern in those days.

638
00:51:25,516 --> 00:51:28,725
There was an All-India Kabbadi
Competition held here in 1921.

639
00:51:28,786 --> 00:51:32,996
The All-Asian Hockey Tournament
was held here in 1945.

640
00:51:33,057 --> 00:51:35,628
There was a Literary
Conference in 1960.

641
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:39,138
These arches are world famous!
You won't find these...

642
00:51:41,165 --> 00:51:44,578
Let me tell you a world
famous story from 3rd grade.

643
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:48,946
I used to trick my teacher,
bunk schoo|...and bathe here...

644
00:51:51,242 --> 00:51:52,414
...Naked!

645
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:53,650
Huh?

646
00:51:57,581 --> 00:51:59,288
Deewan Saheb, is this true?

647
00:51:59,383 --> 00:52:01,829
Deewan Saheb himself
was my swimming coach.

648
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:05,264
He taught me freestyle,
butterfly and breast stroke.

649
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:07,595
Say yes, or else I'll
tell her that you also...

650
00:52:07,658 --> 00:52:11,663
...used to bathe here
with me...naked!

651
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,633
Those were the days.

652
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:17,076
Today's a better day.

653
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:20,581
Come Deewan Saheb let's
show the Princess our diving point.

654
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:21,513
No, no...

655
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:30,849
What are you looking
there for Sweetie?

656
00:52:30,948 --> 00:52:32,757
I'm the one worth looking at.

657
00:52:33,017 --> 00:52:34,052
What do you want?

658
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:37,926
A blue car?

659
00:52:40,057 --> 00:52:41,434
What is happening, Chirag?

660
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:45,337
Sameera isn't able to report
anything, and you're quiet as well.

661
00:52:45,596 --> 00:52:47,769
I understand that even
after such a great fall...

662
00:52:47,865 --> 00:52:49,742
..Bhaisaheb survived medically.

663
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:53,371
But, receiving the Princess
personally at the station...

664
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:55,984
...and now giving her
a tour of the estate...

665
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:57,207
<i>---No!</i>

666
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:00,749
This can't be Bhaisaheb!

667
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,354
Something's definitely wrong, sir.

668
00:53:12,323 --> 00:53:13,996
Very wrong!

669
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:29,978
How are you doing,
Bhabhi (Sister-in-law)?

670
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,348
Welcome to your future home.

671
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:32,887
Hi Ajay, how are you?

672
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:37,186
Bapu...what's with the kisses?
- They're saying hello.

673
00:53:38,449 --> 00:53:39,928
What are you doing?
- Hello!

674
00:53:41,118 --> 00:53:42,597
By the way,
I can't believe it!

675
00:53:42,653 --> 00:53:46,226
He's giving you a tour of the estate...
how romantic!

676
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:51,334
He's won so many polo
tournaments in this club.

677
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:52,338
Hey, wait a minute!

678
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:55,239
Bhabhi, I'm sure you
remember the tournament...

679
00:53:55,299 --> 00:53:59,145
..that Bhaisaheb played
on your engagement day?

680
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:08,983
Anyways I'll leave
the two love-birds a|one...okay?

681
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,752
Okay, Bhaisaheb.

682
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:14,693
Enjoy.
- Okay. And over here...

683
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:21,828
Bapu, what was he trying to instigate?
Scoundrel!

684
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,565
You and your "those- those" places!

685
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:34,440
You had invited all your
friends to meet me that day.

686
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:36,945
We were all joking...

687
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:43,424
...and I said that you'd look
better without your moustache.

688
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:49,996
I don't know what made you so angry
that you left me alone and came here.

689
00:54:50,087 --> 00:54:52,499
No, no...don't cry.

690
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:58,497
Actua||y...that was my
style of expressing love.

691
00:55:01,165 --> 00:55:02,974
You love me?

692
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:03,943
Yes...

693
00:55:05,002 --> 00:55:06,845
...very much.

694
00:55:07,838 --> 00:55:10,341
But I don't know how to express it.

695
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:14,688
Let's go...
for a romantic walk?

696
00:55:34,732 --> 00:55:36,006
Ram- Laxman!

697
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,635
Come here!

698
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:38,736
Quickly quickly!

699
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:40,281
Like the wind!

700
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,475
Terminators!

701
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:43,343
Diary! Pen!

702
00:55:43,574 --> 00:55:44,678
Where are you two from?

703
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:45,616
Gujarat.

704
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:48,517
Silly boys...sit here...

705
00:55:49,313 --> 00:55:50,792
...and turn around.

706
00:55:53,984 --> 00:55:55,224
Before we go any further...

707
00:55:55,319 --> 00:55:57,799
...|ist all your complaints now.

708
00:55:58,055 --> 00:56:01,195
Moustache,
shirt, tie, pant, underwear, vest...

709
00:56:01,292 --> 00:56:02,430
...don't leave anything out.

710
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:04,130
Open your heart.

711
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:08,676
But don't make me write
that I don't love you.

712
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:19,912
"You come closer
whenever you want."

713
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:27,821
"You go away whenever you want."

714
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:31,625
Oh God!

715
00:56:39,663 --> 00:56:43,236
"You come closer
whenever you want."

716
00:56:43,534 --> 00:56:47,505
"You go away whenever you want."

717
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:51,381
"You always do as you please."

718
00:56:51,442 --> 00:56:55,549
"Yet you say you love me."

719
00:56:55,812 --> 00:56:59,954
"I accept my mistake
and my misbehavior."

720
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:02,964
"Love makes me do crazy things."

721
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:07,162
"We break up and patch up
as per your wishes."

722
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:15,043
"We meet whenever you wish."

723
00:57:19,036 --> 00:57:22,848
"You always do as you please."

724
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,817
"What kind of a lover are you?"

725
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:31,591
Wow! You look like a father of nine.

726
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:35,625
Now you like a father of none!

727
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:38,522
Sorry I made you wait.

728
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:44,836
Moustache?

729
00:57:45,496 --> 00:57:48,238
Romance, Deewan Saheb. Romance.

730
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,608
You won't understand
the romance of young India.

731
00:57:50,668 --> 00:57:53,444
The Princess didn't like my moustache,
so I shaved it off.

732
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:56,916
Princess, do you not like my nose?
Should I cut that off too?

733
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:58,282
What do you say Deewan Saheb?

734
00:57:58,342 --> 00:58:00,822
You can cut anyone's
nose any time sir.

735
00:58:00,878 --> 00:58:02,118
Of course.

736
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:03,555
About turn.

737
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:08,586
This is the temple...

738
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:11,222
...where the Prince's first
birthday was celebrated.

739
00:58:11,455 --> 00:58:13,628
The foundation of this
temple was laid in 1953...

740
00:58:13,724 --> 00:58:15,499
...by the Chief Minister himself.

741
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:17,470
Many Union Cabinet ministers
graced the occasion as well.

742
00:58:17,628 --> 00:58:19,539
The place was packed.

743
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:24,511
Flowers were being showered
from one entrance to the other.

744
00:58:26,036 --> 00:58:27,606
Hey! Come here.

745
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:28,849
I said stop!

746
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:30,646
Bapu, stop your preaching.

747
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:32,376
As soon as you start
the geography of some place...

748
00:58:32,476 --> 00:58:35,685
...it reminds her of her history,
and I've to pull out this diary.

749
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:38,986
You'll tell the Princes
only what I tell you. Understand?

750
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:39,753
Huh?

751
00:58:41,385 --> 00:58:42,295
Okay Bapu.

752
00:58:42,419 --> 00:58:45,662
From your own experiences with ladies...

753
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:49,397
...te|| me how do I cajole this lady?

754
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:51,002
I...

755
00:58:51,061 --> 00:58:52,062
Waiting Bapu.

756
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,572
Telling.

757
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:57,110
Bapu, you've zero
experience with ladies.

758
00:58:57,167 --> 00:59:00,410
Your wisdom is
incomp|ete...Virgin Bapu!

759
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:04,444
I'll tell the world
that you're a Virgin Bapu!

760
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:09,286
You haven't seen
this lamp decoration before....

761
00:59:09,513 --> 00:59:12,494
...recent|y we've been
doing it every evening.

762
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:17,521
The Late King would enjoy
poetry in the light of these lamps.

763
00:59:18,422 --> 00:59:22,928
He used to spend quality
time with the Queen here.

764
00:59:22,993 --> 00:59:25,337
Oh...how sweet.

765
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:29,977
Bapu.
- What?

766
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:34,140
Quality time out here? Weren't
there enough rooms in the palace?

767
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,341
Keep quiet!

768
00:59:35,706 --> 00:59:37,549
But Bapu...
- Now shut up!

769
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:48,294
That night I had arranged
a special barbeque for you there.

770
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:51,161
It took me three hours...

771
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:56,565
...to get ready in your
favourite short dress.

772
00:59:57,194 --> 01:00:01,108
And only because
we promised each other...

773
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:04,245
...that we wouldn't fight that evening.

774
01:00:04,868 --> 01:00:08,577
We'd only talk about love.

775
01:00:11,208 --> 01:00:12,346
And you...

776
01:00:13,744 --> 01:00:14,552
And 1...?

777
01:00:15,312 --> 01:00:18,657
‘So what if I took you in my arms?
What else is love?‘

778
01:00:19,016 --> 01:00:21,257
Isn't this what you said?

779
01:00:23,086 --> 01:00:26,499
We couldn't discuss
our future or our feelings.

780
01:00:27,657 --> 01:00:30,797
If only you understood
what a girl really wants.

781
01:00:31,495 --> 01:00:34,908
That was our last fight
and also our last meeting.

782
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:38,135
Prince, you didn't
leave any stone unturned?

783
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:39,578
You're messing up everything!

784
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:41,979
Quality time before marriage?

785
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:45,586
Now it's confirmed that
the Prince is a rascal!

786
01:01:29,086 --> 01:01:34,559
"I still have to learn
the finer nuances of love."

787
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:38,897
"Teach me if you have the time."

788
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:46,780
"Teach me how to impress a lover
with sweet talk."

789
01:01:46,837 --> 01:01:50,717
"Teach me how to
make her give up anger."

790
01:01:50,774 --> 01:01:54,620
"You make mistakes
and act innocent."

791
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:58,124
"Stop these tricks."

792
01:01:58,615 --> 01:02:02,324
"Don't try to impress me.
- Don't make things worse."

793
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:05,959
"Don't even try to
patch up with me."

794
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:14,903
"You can make
the evening lovely."

795
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:23,145
"You can make
the night beautiful."

796
01:02:27,144 --> 01:02:30,956
"I accept whatever punishment
you give me."

797
01:02:31,048 --> 01:02:35,326
"Just give me smile."

798
01:02:42,893 --> 01:02:43,701
Spit it out!

799
01:02:43,893 --> 01:02:44,803
Spit it out!

800
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:45,839
I said spit it out!

801
01:02:45,896 --> 01:02:48,240
Camel, return my diary!

802
01:02:48,298 --> 01:02:51,472
Give it back,
you won't be able to digest it!

803
01:02:51,535 --> 01:02:52,741
You'll get diarrhoea.

804
01:02:52,803 --> 01:02:54,544
Brother Camel! Brother Camel!

805
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:55,582
Please.

806
01:02:55,672 --> 01:02:56,912
I beg of you, Brother Camel.

807
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,713
I touch your feet, Brother Camel.

808
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:02,484
Brother Camel. I will even kiss you,
Brother Camel.

809
01:03:06,049 --> 01:03:08,893
I'll take this one...pack this.

810
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:15,898
Oh Bhaiji...

811
01:03:16,426 --> 01:03:19,532
I have to eat boiled food because
of the Prince's weak digestion.

812
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,905
On top of that I
have to lie 25,000 times.

813
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:23,705
As soon as your Prince
wakes up from coma...

814
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:24,972
...I'|| put a full stop to all this.

815
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:29,948
And I'll ask for a cheque
of Rs.25,000 for Uphaar Foundation.

816
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,019
Is that less?

817
01:03:32,442 --> 01:03:34,922
Come in. Come in. Come in.

818
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:38,985
What are you eating?

819
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:42,723
Well, I won't lie to you.

820
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:46,962
The doctor has forced
me to eat boiled food...

821
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:51,233
...but sometimes I eat what I like.

822
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:55,506
But your weak digestion?

823
01:03:55,599 --> 01:04:00,048
Princess...it's all in the mind!

824
01:04:01,104 --> 01:04:02,378
Hold this.

825
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,216
Where are you going?

826
01:04:04,274 --> 01:04:07,915
I'm thirsty, going to drink water.
- Here, I have water.

827
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:10,818
Not from a bottle like a baby.

828
01:04:11,047 --> 01:04:15,291
Like a kid,
with kids, full of life!

829
01:04:16,486 --> 01:04:20,229
Kids, now I'll help
you drink water. Come on!

830
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:21,993
Here you 9°!

831
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:25,806
Drink up!

832
01:04:25,996 --> 01:04:28,408
Enough, now my turn!

833
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,630
What's all this?

834
01:05:01,164 --> 01:05:02,040
Chandrika!

835
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:03,769
Fix your tie.
Let's go home.

836
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:04,937
Hi, Chandrika!

837
01:05:10,307 --> 01:05:11,581
I'm coming there!

838
01:05:17,781 --> 01:05:19,954
Where've you been?

839
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,437
Radhika, you're looking so different.

840
01:05:32,796 --> 01:05:34,036
So grown up, so cute.

841
01:05:34,164 --> 01:05:35,472
You'll live a long life.

842
01:05:35,565 --> 01:05:39,411
I bought this silver bracelet today,
just like those we wore in school.

843
01:05:39,469 --> 01:05:41,278
Give me your hand.

844
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:00,463
Rickshaw!

845
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:05,268
Listen Chandrika...
- Let's go!

846
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:28,288
Princess Maithili
and Princess Chandrika...

847
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:31,264
...used to study together
in boarding school.

848
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:33,267
They were very good friends.

849
01:06:33,323 --> 01:06:36,327
They were called the Royal Fairies.

850
01:06:36,893 --> 01:06:40,568
But ever since Maithili
got engaged to our Prince...

851
01:06:40,897 --> 01:06:44,970
...Chandrika broke
all ties with her.

852
01:06:45,235 --> 01:06:47,511
The elder sister has
a lot of self- respect...

853
01:06:47,604 --> 01:06:51,609
...she heads the accounts
department of a small school.

854
01:06:52,409 --> 01:06:56,949
Both sisters live in a rented
house with basic amenities.

855
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,122
Radhika!

856
01:07:00,984 --> 01:07:02,827
Radhika, open the door!

857
01:07:02,886 --> 01:07:06,095
It must be the mechanic
with the serviced fridge.

858
01:07:09,893 --> 01:07:11,338
Good morning, Radhika!

859
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:13,806
Your Santa Claus brother
with the big heart...

860
01:07:13,964 --> 01:07:17,275
...has brought you a new TV,
new fridge, new washing machine

861
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:22,612
...and in bonus has also brought
a microwave, a kettle and a football.

862
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:30,348
Your big brother's
also brought two big beds...

863
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:33,893
...and two queen size mattresses
for my two Princess sisters.

864
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:36,487
Come on, unload everything.
And give me that.

865
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:40,968
And as bonus, I've brought
this key and that car.

866
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:45,339
Please accept all my gifts.

867
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:51,239
And Chanda,
let's just bury the past!

868
01:07:52,636 --> 01:07:53,808
Of course.

869
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:57,750
But before that can
we talk in private. Please?

870
01:08:04,213 --> 01:08:06,716
So what's your offer?

871
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:12,664
There's no offer,
I just brought some gifts.

872
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:13,698
And...

873
01:08:15,992 --> 01:08:18,063
...a request. Keep this.

874
01:08:18,294 --> 01:08:23,243
From one royal fairy
to the other...a gift of love.

875
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:28,680
By taking these you want us to
accept that you've won and we've lost?

876
01:08:29,072 --> 01:08:32,713
There's no winning or losing
amongst siblings.

877
01:08:32,809 --> 01:08:35,949
What relationships is
he talking about Mr. Bhandari?

878
01:08:36,146 --> 01:08:40,390
Which anyone can buy in the market?

879
01:08:40,483 --> 01:08:45,489
Where one starts a relationship
only for his advantage!

880
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:50,895
Please ask him Uncle...

881
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:55,874
...what does the
Queen's son want...

882
01:08:56,866 --> 01:09:00,609
...from the King's mistress‘ daughters?

883
01:09:08,178 --> 01:09:10,818
And if you're here to show
your greatness and generosity...

884
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,487
...then pardon me,
but we don't need your favours.

885
01:09:14,751 --> 01:09:16,662
Take everything back!

886
01:09:18,054 --> 01:09:20,091
Didn't you hear me?

887
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:29,809
And if it's against the future King's
honour to take these things back...

888
01:09:29,866 --> 01:09:31,345
...then it's perfectly alright.

889
01:09:31,401 --> 01:09:35,975
We have no such honour to
lose by throwing these things out.

890
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:47,790
Come Radhika!

891
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:38,474
Hey, put that in the centre!

892
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:41,344
And reflect this
light in that direction...

893
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:44,146
...the poor girls are melting
like ice-cream in the sun.

894
01:10:44,207 --> 01:10:45,413
One minute...

895
01:10:45,508 --> 01:10:48,421
...gir|s...shake your waists.

896
01:10:50,446 --> 01:10:54,690
You'll be on the front
page of my book, wonderful!

897
01:10:56,753 --> 01:10:58,027
Ready?

898
01:10:59,489 --> 01:11:00,627
Shake!

899
01:11:05,161 --> 01:11:08,472
You're taking a still picture, right?
So why should I shake?

900
01:11:08,965 --> 01:11:10,672
Don't try to teach me!

901
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:11,971
Click fast!

902
01:11:12,335 --> 01:11:12,972
Yeah!

903
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:18,176
Sameera, what's happening?

904
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:21,350
Sir I'm busy with this uncle.

905
01:11:23,313 --> 01:11:24,724
And where are you Chirag?

906
01:11:24,881 --> 01:11:26,189
I'm outside the palace sir.

907
01:11:26,249 --> 01:11:28,661
Getting cars ready for the guests.

908
01:11:28,752 --> 01:11:30,060
Oh, I see.

909
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:33,094
And I'm ready for my sherwani trial...

910
01:11:33,256 --> 01:11:35,668
that I'm wearing for the coronation.

911
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:40,365
The coronation is tomorrow!
What are we doing?

912
01:11:40,897 --> 01:11:44,743
There are still 24 hours
left for the coronation sir.

913
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:50,049
And I'm keeping my eye on every single
thing, and on every single person!

914
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:13,803
Hello.

915
01:12:14,297 --> 01:12:16,140
Go carefully Chaudhary.

916
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:18,470
And feed the Prince with care.

917
01:12:18,701 --> 01:12:19,771
Yes sir.

918
01:12:28,711 --> 01:12:30,418
Dilwale!

919
01:12:32,048 --> 01:12:33,459
Is this the time to sleep?

920
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:37,153
I wasn't sleeping I was thinking...

921
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:40,857
...these royal men wear
such tight clothes.

922
01:12:40,957 --> 01:12:44,530
Bapu, what if someone
has to go to the washroom? - Hey!

923
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:46,502
It's confirmed, now I know!

924
01:12:46,596 --> 01:12:48,098
I don't like jokes all the time.

925
01:12:48,164 --> 01:12:49,507
Lower your feet, stand up!

926
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:51,408
Yes devi|...I mean Deewan!

927
01:12:53,069 --> 01:12:55,572
You created such a big scene
at the sisters‘ house yesterday...

928
01:12:55,672 --> 01:12:58,551
...thankfu||y everything
remained within their home.

929
01:12:58,608 --> 01:13:01,487
Today's function is at
the garden close to their house.

930
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:03,490
Nothing should go wrong, understand?

931
01:13:03,913 --> 01:13:08,419
Bapu, the sisters‘
mother was not a Queen?

932
01:13:09,185 --> 01:13:12,564
None of your business!
They aren't your sisters!

933
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:18,972
Yes Sanjay.

934
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:20,833
Fine.

935
01:13:23,333 --> 01:13:24,835
Princess Maithili is waiting for you...

936
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:26,539
...in the Prince's personal suite.

937
01:13:27,136 --> 01:13:31,209
Remember,
the Princess isn't yours either!

938
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:38,418
Bapu's lost it. Totally mad.

939
01:13:54,664 --> 01:13:57,406
I'm waiting.

940
01:14:02,205 --> 01:14:07,587
Get well soon, Prince...
Bapu's making my life miserable.

941
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:14,985
Oh drat!

942
01:14:21,724 --> 01:14:25,365
Beautiful lady,
there's still some time for this!

943
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:32,536
Another secret...a secret passage!

944
01:14:32,769 --> 01:14:35,716
That goes from one heart to the other?

945
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:39,851
I've brought food
from Ha|diram's shop.

946
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:43,549
Your doctors will be at the party so
they won't let you eat it...eat fast!

947
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:49,423
Did you come specially for this?

948
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:51,462
I also wanted to say sorry...

949
01:14:51,788 --> 01:14:55,759
...for all the complaints
that I made you write.

950
01:14:56,359 --> 01:14:59,602
I've realized what true love is.

951
01:15:01,431 --> 01:15:05,937
The Prince went to his sisters‘
house to make amends, for my sake.

952
01:15:06,202 --> 01:15:10,150
If that isn't true love,
then what else is it?

953
01:15:13,543 --> 01:15:16,752
Your coronation functions start today.

954
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:22,019
Will you find a better hostess
than me... to make them memorable?

955
01:15:44,173 --> 01:15:45,516
Pardon me, Princess...

956
01:15:45,575 --> 01:15:48,556
we called you and the
Prince here before the guests arrived.

957
01:15:48,611 --> 01:15:51,421
Actually, we needed to discuss
today's program with the Prince.

958
01:15:51,514 --> 01:15:53,460
That's okay Deewan Saheb...
I also wanted to check...

959
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,790
...whether the flower
arrangement in the banquet area...

960
01:15:55,852 --> 01:15:57,991
...is as we decided earlier.
Excuse me!

961
01:15:58,054 --> 01:15:59,795
Hold on.
- Yes, Bapu?

962
01:15:59,856 --> 01:16:02,598
Take this.
- Oh a book?

963
01:16:04,027 --> 01:16:05,335
The "History of Our Kings".

964
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,806
Your speech today will
be in pure Hindi. - Huh?

965
01:16:07,864 --> 01:16:09,468
Yes, memorize it.

966
01:16:09,665 --> 01:16:12,202
Today's protocol, first your speech...

967
01:16:12,268 --> 01:16:15,147
...fo||owed by classical music...

968
01:16:15,605 --> 01:16:18,142
...after that classical dance....

969
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:20,349
...and then finally lunch!

970
01:16:20,443 --> 01:16:21,922
Oh...|unch Bapu.

971
01:16:22,445 --> 01:16:23,321
Boiled for you.

972
01:16:23,479 --> 01:16:24,514
No!
<i>‘</i> Yes!

973
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:31,054
Yeah.

974
01:16:43,866 --> 01:16:45,368
If I were the same old Maithili...

975
01:16:45,534 --> 01:16:48,947
...then I definitely would
have misspelled your name.

976
01:16:58,814 --> 01:17:02,193
Jiji (Sister)! I'm going to school
for football practice.

977
01:17:02,285 --> 01:17:05,789
No, we won't step
out of the house today.

978
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:09,296
Why should we stay at home
because of the Prince's function?

979
01:17:09,492 --> 01:17:12,234
No arguments Radhika!
I don't want anyone to think...

980
01:17:12,395 --> 01:17:14,432
...that we're a part of
their happiness in any way.

981
01:17:14,497 --> 01:17:16,170
Come help me.

982
01:17:18,334 --> 01:17:19,438
Radhika!

983
01:17:43,559 --> 01:17:45,664
It's okay I'll redo it.
- No, no.

984
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:50,574
Today my football loving
sister will decorate this with you.

985
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:54,337
If I don't make her your
assistant in this function...

986
01:17:54,437 --> 01:17:56,508
...then my name isn't...

987
01:17:56,773 --> 01:17:58,912
...the name you're writing so lovingly.

988
01:17:58,974 --> 01:18:01,011
But for this, I need your permission.

989
01:18:01,077 --> 01:18:03,057
I want to forget
that I'm a King's son.

990
01:18:03,112 --> 01:18:07,185
I want to pretend that I'm a villager,
for the betterment of the family.

991
01:18:07,316 --> 01:18:10,092
Please help!
- Permission granted.

992
01:18:11,888 --> 01:18:14,391
Then you'll also have to play along.
- Play along?

993
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:19,200
Imagine that we're enacting
the play of Ram-Leela, and you...?

994
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:24,438
Sita will do exactly...
what Lord Rama wishes.

995
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:33,683
A warm welcome to everyone.

996
01:18:33,843 --> 01:18:35,789
And now our future King...

997
01:18:35,911 --> 01:18:40,360
...wi|| address all
of you with a few words.

998
01:18:40,416 --> 01:18:42,293
I request His Majesty...

999
01:19:00,069 --> 01:19:01,878
Ladies...!

1000
01:19:04,874 --> 01:19:07,354
Ladies and Gentlemen!

1001
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:09,886
As always, it's time to...

1002
01:19:09,945 --> 01:19:15,861
...give a long speech in pure Hindi...

1003
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:19,327
...the length and breadth of which...

1004
01:19:19,388 --> 01:19:25,339
...can bore you, put you
to sleep, and make you run away.

1005
01:19:25,728 --> 01:19:27,639
This ground has a history...

1006
01:19:27,797 --> 01:19:35,477
...that long ago people
played "Padh Kanduk" (Football)...

1007
01:19:35,538 --> 01:19:40,920
So for the satisfaction of our
ancestors‘ spirits...

1008
01:19:40,977 --> 01:19:43,981
...can we play football again,
why not?

1009
01:19:57,426 --> 01:19:58,268
Sorry sir...

1010
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:00,202
Bhaiji...

1011
01:20:00,329 --> 01:20:01,103
Bhaiji...

1012
01:20:03,532 --> 01:20:04,875
Sir...

1013
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:14,315
Sir! Did you get cold feet
at the thought of playing football?

1014
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:17,186
Where's your youthful energy?

1015
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:21,458
Your Highness,
you just challenged a Punjabi.

1016
01:20:21,784 --> 01:20:25,163
I haven't lost my youth or my game.

1017
01:20:25,354 --> 01:20:26,628
You let it be.

1018
01:20:26,689 --> 01:20:27,565
Isee...

1019
01:20:27,623 --> 01:20:30,729
Then come on friends,
let's show them what we can do.

1020
01:20:32,027 --> 01:20:34,530
Let's go get them!

1021
01:20:35,097 --> 01:20:38,670
Buckle up, friends!
- Let's go!

1022
01:20:39,035 --> 01:20:42,847
Come on my heroes!

1023
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:48,918
Sir, one minute!

1024
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:50,490
Another hero!

1025
01:20:51,147 --> 01:20:52,251
Poor hero.

1026
01:20:52,548 --> 01:20:55,552
Dear |adies...whi|e the
gentlemen play football...

1027
01:20:55,618 --> 01:20:57,723
...you can chatter and gossip.

1028
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:00,595
Excuse me!

1029
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:02,128
Yes.

1030
01:21:02,558 --> 01:21:04,697
What do you mean
‘chatter and gossip‘?

1031
01:21:04,793 --> 01:21:06,067
We'll play too.

1032
01:21:07,897 --> 01:21:11,936
Look who's asking for the moon!

1033
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:16,813
Pardon me Princess, playing
football isn't your cup of tea.

1034
01:21:16,905 --> 01:21:20,114
Your place is in the
kitchen cutting vegetables...

1035
01:21:20,309 --> 01:21:22,346
...cut...cut...cut...cut...cut!

1036
01:21:25,648 --> 01:21:28,629
Hey, what nonsense! We can also play!

1037
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:31,960
Ma'am, why're you sitting
shy like a new bride?

1038
01:21:32,021 --> 01:21:35,400
Do you want to spend your life in the
kitchen, or prove something to them?

1039
01:21:35,491 --> 01:21:39,496
You're challenging a Punjabi woman?

1040
01:21:41,697 --> 01:21:45,702
Enough of cooking and cleaning.

1041
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:48,070
All day, just ‘open the door...
close the door...

1042
01:21:48,137 --> 01:21:49,912
...open the door...c|ose the door!‘

1043
01:21:49,972 --> 01:21:52,179
The time has come to show...

1044
01:21:52,308 --> 01:21:54,151
...what girls can do
on the playing field.

1045
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:56,986
So let's rock girls
and kick some ball!

1046
01:21:57,046 --> 01:21:57,956
Yeah!

1047
01:21:58,814 --> 01:22:01,124
Let's get on the field!

1048
01:22:01,283 --> 01:22:05,925
Excuse me, excuse me!
You're all mistaken!

1049
01:22:05,988 --> 01:22:08,628
Sorry, Deewan Saheb,
we can't take you in our team...

1050
01:22:08,724 --> 01:22:11,170
...our team's full!
We give you to the girl's team!

1051
01:22:11,227 --> 01:22:13,537
Take him away!
- What joke is this?

1052
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:20,270
Deewan Saheb how do we play this game?
- I don't know.

1053
01:22:20,336 --> 01:22:21,974
You just need to kick the ball.

1054
01:22:22,071 --> 01:22:25,143
They don't remember birthdays,
anniversaries, or love!

1055
01:22:25,341 --> 01:22:27,753
Sir, goalkeeper.
- Yes.

1056
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:31,383
Masoorie unc|e...backward.
- No, no, forward.

1057
01:22:31,447 --> 01:22:32,755
Forwa rd.

1058
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:36,194
Referee...fu|| on cheating, or else...

1059
01:22:47,096 --> 01:22:48,336
How was my acting?

1060
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:50,137
I couldn't take my eyes off you.

1061
01:22:50,199 --> 01:22:52,076
She's watching too.

1062
01:22:52,868 --> 01:22:56,543
Today can I also forget
that I'm a Princess?

1063
01:22:56,605 --> 01:23:00,985
And pretend that I'm a village girl...
who loves a village boy!

1064
01:23:11,754 --> 01:23:15,566
"Come here, you carefree girl."

1065
01:23:15,624 --> 01:23:20,130
"You have become quarrelsome."

1066
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:30,648
"Rude and arrogant
is your behaviour."

1067
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:36,451
"Let's fight it off."

1068
01:23:36,545 --> 01:23:40,288
"Let's fight it off."

1069
01:23:40,549 --> 01:23:44,725
"You want a fight
and you'll get it."

1070
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:47,992
"Give it your best shot."

1071
01:23:48,057 --> 01:23:53,666
"Let's fight it off."

1072
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:58,072
"Let's fight it off."

1073
01:23:58,267 --> 01:23:59,211
Ouch!

1074
01:24:06,175 --> 01:24:07,654
Goal!

1075
01:24:09,178 --> 01:24:13,888
Referee foul! Foul! This is not fair!

1076
01:24:18,954 --> 01:24:22,401
Radhika go wash and
dry these clothes. - Jiji

1077
01:24:22,658 --> 01:24:23,796
Go!

1078
01:24:49,318 --> 01:24:50,353
Goal!

1079
01:24:50,552 --> 01:24:51,792
Goal!

1080
01:24:52,021 --> 01:24:53,227
No!

1081
01:24:53,455 --> 01:24:55,731
Sister, one goal.

1082
01:24:55,824 --> 01:25:01,775
"Your eyes cast a spell on me."

1083
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:07,542
"Do not stare at me."

1084
01:25:07,636 --> 01:25:13,245
"Your eyes cast a spell on me."

1085
01:25:13,342 --> 01:25:18,485
"Do not stare at me."

1086
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:22,628
"Scared you are to look into my eyes.
What kind of a man are you?"

1087
01:25:22,718 --> 01:25:27,758
"How will you make me yours?"

1088
01:25:27,856 --> 01:25:33,534
"Let's fight it off."

1089
01:25:33,629 --> 01:25:37,509
"Let's fight it off."

1090
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:38,842
Ouch!

1091
01:25:43,038 --> 01:25:44,813
Goal!

1092
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:57,256
Yeah?
- Good news sir!

1093
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:40,639
Ouch!

1094
01:27:16,632 --> 01:27:18,441
What are you doing?

1095
01:27:18,867 --> 01:27:20,710
Go away!

1096
01:27:39,755 --> 01:27:41,462
Oh come on!

1097
01:27:52,935 --> 01:27:53,845
Ouch!

1098
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:56,882
Ouch!

1099
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:43,295
Ouch!

1100
01:29:22,858 --> 01:29:24,531
Let's g0!

1101
01:29:37,939 --> 01:29:42,718
Start packing Radhika. We won't stay
in this estate for another minute.

1102
01:29:51,687 --> 01:29:54,031
Hurry up Radhika!

1103
01:29:56,992 --> 01:30:00,701
Do sisters leave their
families before marriage?

1104
01:30:00,796 --> 01:30:04,744
Please stop your fake
filmy dialogue and gestures!

1105
01:30:05,133 --> 01:30:07,113
Do you really care about us?

1106
01:30:07,169 --> 01:30:11,140
Do you actually know what
we're going through and what we want?

1107
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:13,110
What do you want?

1108
01:30:14,509 --> 01:30:18,514
We want the palace you live in!
Will you give it?

1109
01:30:20,582 --> 01:30:23,358
The same palace where your
mother lived with the King...

1110
01:30:23,452 --> 01:30:26,592
...but the doors were
always closed for our mother.

1111
01:30:26,655 --> 01:30:28,999
All her life our mother
shed tears in this house...

1112
01:30:29,057 --> 01:30:32,470
...whi|e the King had one celebration
after the other over there.

1113
01:30:32,527 --> 01:30:36,498
The same palace where you'll
celebrate with your Queen.

1114
01:30:36,565 --> 01:30:38,567
We want that palace!

1115
01:30:42,571 --> 01:30:45,711
Go away! Attend to your guests!

1116
01:30:54,249 --> 01:30:56,991
The palace will be given to you.

1117
01:30:59,988 --> 01:31:04,061
This is your filmy
brother's promise to you.

1118
01:31:07,829 --> 01:31:10,867
With what right did you promise
the sisters this palace?

1119
01:31:10,966 --> 01:31:12,639
I thought it'll make them happy...

1120
01:31:13,068 --> 01:31:14,843
...but only for my knowledge Bapu...

1121
01:31:14,903 --> 01:31:17,110
...is this palace more
important than their happiness?

1122
01:31:17,172 --> 01:31:20,619
Only the Prince has the right
to ask this question, not you!

1123
01:31:20,709 --> 01:31:22,279
Would he have refused?

1124
01:31:22,377 --> 01:31:25,847
In that case...the Prince
needs to learn a lot from us!

1125
01:31:25,914 --> 01:31:27,894
What did you say?

1126
01:31:27,949 --> 01:31:30,429
Look Deewan Saheb
everything's going well...

1127
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:32,260
...someday you'll give us an award.

1128
01:31:32,354 --> 01:31:33,890
You want an award?

1129
01:31:33,989 --> 01:31:36,560
Here's your award!
Bloody clowns!

1130
01:31:36,625 --> 01:31:39,231
Sanjay, get the car
now and drop them...

1131
01:31:39,294 --> 01:31:42,070
...at the same market
you picked them up from.

1132
01:31:42,130 --> 01:31:46,169
I've endured your daily antics,
but not anymore!

1133
01:31:48,070 --> 01:31:50,050
And what are you waiting for?

1134
01:31:50,138 --> 01:31:52,277
The Prince is fully
aware of our cover up...

1135
01:31:52,374 --> 01:31:55,412
...he's said he'll be present
for his coronation tomorrow.

1136
01:31:55,477 --> 01:31:58,424
Don't forget that we've also
nabbed that driver Chuttan...

1137
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:02,485
...soon he'll confess who
conspired to kill the Prince!

1138
01:32:02,751 --> 01:32:05,823
Dilwale, you're not
needed here anymore...

1139
01:32:05,921 --> 01:32:06,922
<i>---Qur!</i>

1140
01:32:07,022 --> 01:32:08,194
Get out!

1141
01:32:08,490 --> 01:32:11,699
How can artists be respected
in a place where humanity isn't?

1142
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:13,762
Let's go Prem Bhaiya!

1143
01:32:17,933 --> 01:32:18,843
Hello.

1144
01:32:20,001 --> 01:32:20,945
What?

1145
01:32:30,412 --> 01:32:32,756
When we got here...

1146
01:32:34,883 --> 01:32:37,159
...the Prince wasn't here, and...

1147
01:32:42,257 --> 01:32:45,704
Deewan Saheb,
we found this note here.

1148
01:32:47,462 --> 01:32:49,703
‘We're taking him with us.‘

1149
01:32:49,765 --> 01:32:55,738
‘There's no need for
two Princes in one kingdom!‘

1150
01:33:00,075 --> 01:33:01,076
Deewan Saheb?

1151
01:33:01,543 --> 01:33:02,647
I'm fine!

1152
01:33:03,645 --> 01:33:05,488
Careful Deewan Saheb!

1153
01:33:25,734 --> 01:33:27,270
How's Bapu?

1154
01:33:27,836 --> 01:33:29,907
He suffered another asthma attack.

1155
01:33:30,071 --> 01:33:31,914
He already has high sugar...

1156
01:33:32,541 --> 01:33:36,284
...the doctor has advised
him rest.

1157
01:33:36,645 --> 01:33:39,558
We added to his tension didn't we?

1158
01:33:43,151 --> 01:33:47,395
Deewan Saheb, I'll find the
Prince and bring him back...

1159
01:33:47,456 --> 01:33:49,265
...he'|| be fine.

1160
01:33:49,558 --> 01:33:52,505
I know the Prince will be fine.

1161
01:33:52,861 --> 01:33:54,966
Chuttan is in our custody...

1162
01:33:55,230 --> 01:33:58,609
...Ajay knows if
he hurts the Prince...

1163
01:33:58,767 --> 01:34:01,805
...then we'll make
Chuttan confess in public...

1164
01:34:01,870 --> 01:34:04,510
...his secret will be exposed.

1165
01:34:09,144 --> 01:34:14,321
Your Majesty, in order to
save one of your sons...

1166
01:34:14,616 --> 01:34:18,792
..we'|| have to strike
a deal with the other.

1167
01:34:19,854 --> 01:34:25,566
Forgive me Your Majesty,
I couldn't unite your children...

1168
01:34:25,827 --> 01:34:29,274
...you always wanted
them to stay together...

1169
01:34:29,331 --> 01:34:33,575
...you built the Sheesh Mahal
(Palace of Mirrors) with that dream...

1170
01:34:36,104 --> 01:34:37,981
Kids have a look!

1171
01:34:46,348 --> 01:34:49,056
Gifts for all of you!

1172
01:34:49,884 --> 01:34:53,923
This is for you...for you...
and for you!

1173
01:34:55,256 --> 01:34:57,258
Deewan Saheb this
Sheesh Mahal is a symbol...

1174
01:34:57,325 --> 01:35:00,067
...of these children's innocence.

1175
01:35:00,729 --> 01:35:03,039
Their mothers are different and...

1176
01:35:03,765 --> 01:35:06,268
...that was my weakness.

1177
01:35:07,502 --> 01:35:12,542
But their hearts are one,
and that's their strength!

1178
01:35:18,346 --> 01:35:22,817
I want the children to
keep visiting this Sheesh Mahal...

1179
01:35:23,084 --> 01:35:25,690
...and every mirror here...

1180
01:35:26,121 --> 01:35:29,933
...should reflect their
golden childhood to them!

1181
01:35:30,192 --> 01:35:34,607
"Where is the home of my dreams?"

1182
01:35:34,796 --> 01:35:39,302
"Mirror, take me back
to my childhood."

1183
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:43,871
"Where is the home of my dreams?"

1184
01:35:43,938 --> 01:35:48,080
"Mirror, take me back
to my childhood."

1185
01:35:48,510 --> 01:35:52,583
"Life was simple."

1186
01:35:53,014 --> 01:35:57,622
"Mirror, take me back
to my childhood."

1187
01:35:57,686 --> 01:36:02,032
"Where is the home of my dreams?"

1188
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:06,368
"Mirror, take me back
to my childhood."

1189
01:36:43,898 --> 01:36:53,683
"Without you, darling,
everything seems unreal."

1190
01:36:53,741 --> 01:37:03,526
"Days and evenings
are spent in lonliness."

1191
01:37:03,618 --> 01:37:09,591
"Without you, dar|ing.."

1192
01:37:14,529 --> 01:37:16,839
I'll click a photo too.

1193
01:37:17,265 --> 01:37:18,335
She can't take a photo!

1194
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,402
She can't take a photo!
Not her...not her....

1195
01:37:20,502 --> 01:37:22,140
Ajay let her click!

1196
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:24,741
Ajav!

1197
01:37:27,409 --> 01:37:28,820
Ajav!

1198
01:37:30,345 --> 01:37:33,292
Ajay, give me your hand!
Come on!

1199
01:37:34,049 --> 01:37:36,222
Bhaiya!
- Ajay!

1200
01:37:39,788 --> 01:37:41,461
Ajay don't be scared!

1201
01:37:42,223 --> 01:37:44,066
Bhaiya!

1202
01:37:44,325 --> 01:37:45,827
Give me your other hand!

1203
01:37:46,094 --> 01:37:47,903
Come on Ajay!

1204
01:37:47,962 --> 01:37:50,272
Take care of the kids.
- Kids, move!

1205
01:37:50,699 --> 01:37:52,007
Ajav!

1206
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:55,973
Ajay, give him your hand.
Be careful.

1207
01:38:13,855 --> 01:38:18,304
Now your teaching your
kid to take others‘ kids lives?

1208
01:38:18,626 --> 01:38:22,438
This teacher will only
remain your mistress!

1209
01:38:22,497 --> 01:38:24,875
If I see her again I'll kill her!

1210
01:38:24,966 --> 01:38:28,209
I'm not going to entertain
your first wife's son...

1211
01:38:28,302 --> 01:38:30,373
and your mistress!

1212
01:38:30,572 --> 01:38:34,645
‘Since that day both the mothers
refused to send their children here.‘

1213
01:38:34,742 --> 01:38:38,815
‘The feud between the women
shattered the King's heart...‘

1214
01:38:38,947 --> 01:38:44,693
'...he decided to divide his home,
properties and estate.‘

1215
01:38:44,786 --> 01:38:46,732
‘The children could no
longer meet each other...‘

1216
01:38:46,821 --> 01:38:50,894
'...and the Sheesh Mahal
was closed forever!‘

1217
01:38:55,997 --> 01:38:59,774
I advised him to let the children
spend their childhood together...

1218
01:38:59,868 --> 01:39:02,474
...so that hatred would not affect them.

1219
01:39:02,537 --> 01:39:04,574
That's exactly what happened.

1220
01:39:05,173 --> 01:39:07,813
Spending one's
childhood with siblings...

1221
01:39:07,942 --> 01:39:13,221
...is as sacred as reciting
the 'Bhagwad Gita' or the 'Ramayana'.

1222
01:39:16,417 --> 01:39:20,263
You must have been a
saint in your past life Bapu.

1223
01:39:22,190 --> 01:39:25,967
Will you desert your
Bapu in such circumstances?

1224
01:39:27,963 --> 01:39:32,343
Mature Bapu,
now I want to hear your story.

1225
01:39:32,567 --> 01:39:37,277
The King had three women...
what about you?

1226
01:39:39,307 --> 01:39:41,412
Tell me Bapu!

1227
01:39:43,511 --> 01:39:49,223
The simplicity you both have
is your biggest award Kanhaiya.

1228
01:39:50,485 --> 01:39:52,590
Tomorrow is the coronation...

1229
01:39:53,321 --> 01:39:56,700
...since you've helped me so far,
please help a few days more...

1230
01:39:56,925 --> 01:39:59,929
...unti| we find the Prince.

1231
01:40:00,895 --> 01:40:06,345
If possible, return these siblings
their childhood...

1232
01:40:07,635 --> 01:40:13,677
...shower some of your love on them too.

1233
01:40:16,711 --> 01:40:22,855
The royal honour is now
in your hands Prem Dilwale!

1234
01:40:32,226 --> 01:40:34,502
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

1235
01:40:34,562 --> 01:40:36,633
Glory to Princess Maithili!

1236
01:40:36,731 --> 01:40:38,938
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

1237
01:40:39,033 --> 01:40:40,979
Glory to Princess Maithili!

1238
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:42,946
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

1239
01:40:43,004 --> 01:40:45,143
Glory to Princess Maithili!

1240
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:47,447
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

1241
01:40:47,508 --> 01:40:49,886
Glory to Princess Maithili!

1242
01:41:00,688 --> 01:41:03,692
These two here? During the coronation?

1243
01:41:04,225 --> 01:41:08,469
Sir I've heard that this imposter
is giving them this palace today.

1244
01:41:08,730 --> 01:41:09,333
What?

1245
01:41:09,397 --> 01:41:12,742
Calm down. Everyone will
get their share. Don't cry!

1246
01:41:16,604 --> 01:41:18,049
Chandrika?

1247
01:41:18,106 --> 01:41:21,144
I'll leave as soon as
my work is done uncle.

1248
01:41:24,913 --> 01:41:26,085
Sit here!

1249
01:42:01,683 --> 01:42:03,629
Respected guests...

1250
01:42:03,685 --> 01:42:09,328
...I've been bestowed with the responsibility
to officiate this historical event...

1251
01:42:10,024 --> 01:42:13,836
...in a few moments,
the Prince will be crowned...

1252
01:42:13,895 --> 01:42:18,310
...as per traditional
rituals and customs.

1253
01:42:18,733 --> 01:42:25,412
But before that I want
to read out the Prince's declaration.

1254
01:42:31,379 --> 01:42:33,381
‘I want to apologize to all those...‘

1255
01:42:33,648 --> 01:42:39,690
'...whom I have knowingly
or unknowingly hurt.‘

1256
01:42:40,121 --> 01:42:42,863
‘Every family has
misunderstandings...‘

1257
01:42:43,057 --> 01:42:47,130
'...and when your own hurt you,
it's far more painful.‘

1258
01:42:47,595 --> 01:42:51,566
‘I can't bring back
the time that's passed...‘

1259
01:42:52,066 --> 01:42:54,876
'...but I can share the pain.‘

1260
01:42:55,436 --> 01:42:58,144
‘And in order to share
my sisters‘ pain...‘

1261
01:42:58,940 --> 01:43:03,150
'...I want to gift them
this palace!‘

1262
01:43:08,182 --> 01:43:13,632
‘Not just the palace, I would like to
share with my sisters...‘

1263
01:43:13,821 --> 01:43:17,325
'...everything that I have inherited.‘

1264
01:43:19,994 --> 01:43:22,873
‘Mansions in London and Switzerland...‘

1265
01:43:22,963 --> 01:43:25,000
'...the Esha Nagar farmhouses...‘

1266
01:43:25,099 --> 01:43:28,637
‘Properties, jewellery and factories.‘

1267
01:43:29,570 --> 01:43:33,245
‘All the legal
documents are here...‘

1268
01:43:33,474 --> 01:43:36,353
'...|et's share everything together!‘

1269
01:43:57,832 --> 01:44:01,871
Chandrika,
now you have a share in everything...

1270
01:44:02,103 --> 01:44:06,347
...as my share,
can I get my sister back?

1271
01:44:13,181 --> 01:44:15,422
You're right Chandrika...

1272
01:44:15,483 --> 01:44:20,296
...brother, sister are just words.

1273
01:44:21,289 --> 01:44:25,032
What truly matters
is the brother sister bond...

1274
01:44:25,093 --> 01:44:28,472
...which gives you every
right to get upset...

1275
01:44:28,630 --> 01:44:33,101
...but no one can take
away my right to win you over.

1276
01:44:39,173 --> 01:44:42,848
I've heard that as a child,
when I used to play cricket...

1277
01:44:42,944 --> 01:44:48,292
...Chanda would insist on being
the first one to wish me good luck.

1278
01:44:48,916 --> 01:44:50,896
Remember Chanda?

1279
01:44:52,653 --> 01:44:56,100
And today when I'm
embarking on this journey...

1280
01:44:56,157 --> 01:44:58,728
...to take the traditions
of this family forward...

1281
01:44:58,826 --> 01:45:03,571
...won't you encourage me again Chanda?

1282
01:45:50,912 --> 01:45:53,791
If you still have any reservations...

1283
01:45:53,881 --> 01:45:56,521
...then count me as an outsider.

1284
01:46:04,091 --> 01:46:09,507
"Happiness and sorrow
are not real."

1285
01:46:10,665 --> 01:46:15,705
"Wealth is not real either."

1286
01:46:16,804 --> 01:46:23,915
"And so are attachments."

1287
01:46:26,013 --> 01:46:31,013
"Real is the corner of the heart.."

1288
01:46:37,758 --> 01:46:44,767
"..that treasures love."

1289
01:46:45,566 --> 01:46:51,312
"That treasures love."

1290
01:47:32,213 --> 01:47:33,248
"I have found love."

1291
01:47:34,548 --> 01:47:35,618
"I have found love."

1292
01:47:36,918 --> 01:47:37,988
"Love has brought him."

1293
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:40,355
"Love has taken over me."

1294
01:47:41,689 --> 01:47:42,793
"He has come."

1295
01:47:44,024 --> 01:47:45,196
"He sang."

1296
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:47,564
"I have found love."

1297
01:47:50,697 --> 01:47:55,510
"Darling, you are amazing
and your words."

1298
01:47:57,772 --> 01:48:02,084
"Darling, you are amazing
and your words."

1299
01:48:02,409 --> 01:48:06,858
"Rubbed off me
have these qualities of yours."

1300
01:48:06,947 --> 01:48:11,623
"I have found love."

1301
01:48:11,685 --> 01:48:15,565
"I have found love."

1302
01:48:15,623 --> 01:48:18,001
"I have found
the treasure of love."

1303
01:48:18,058 --> 01:48:20,402
"I have found
the treasure of love."

1304
01:48:20,627 --> 01:48:22,800
"Our meeting seems inevitable."

1305
01:48:22,863 --> 01:48:24,365
"I have found
the treasure of love."

1306
01:48:25,233 --> 01:48:30,342
"I have found
the treasure of love."

1307
01:49:08,976 --> 01:49:17,794
"Do I express or suppress my love?"

1308
01:49:18,486 --> 01:49:27,270
"I wonder why I feel so exited."

1309
01:49:27,962 --> 01:49:32,604
"Happiness is everywhere."

1310
01:49:32,667 --> 01:49:37,173
"I am blushing red."

1311
01:49:37,405 --> 01:49:41,876
"Rubbed off me
have these qualities of yours."

1312
01:49:41,942 --> 01:49:46,687
"I have found love."

1313
01:49:46,747 --> 01:49:50,627
"I have found love."

1314
01:49:50,717 --> 01:49:53,061
"I have found the treasure of love."

1315
01:49:53,120 --> 01:49:55,430
"I have found the treasure of love."

1316
01:49:55,522 --> 01:49:57,695
"I am in seventh heaven."

1317
01:49:57,892 --> 01:49:59,337
"Treasure of love."

1318
01:50:00,261 --> 01:50:05,370
"I have found the treasure of love."

1319
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:07,635
"Love has taken over me."

1320
01:50:09,003 --> 01:50:10,107
"He has come."

1321
01:50:11,338 --> 01:50:12,544
"Love has brought him."

1322
01:50:13,741 --> 01:50:14,913
"He has come."

1323
01:50:16,110 --> 01:50:17,453
"Love has brought him."

1324
01:50:18,478 --> 01:50:19,548
"I have found love."

1325
01:50:20,814 --> 01:50:22,054
"Love has taken over me."

1326
01:50:23,217 --> 01:50:24,423
"He has come."

1327
01:50:25,653 --> 01:50:26,757
"Love has brought him."

1328
01:50:28,022 --> 01:50:29,160
"I have found love."

1329
01:50:30,324 --> 01:50:31,826
"I have found love."

1330
01:50:35,830 --> 01:50:37,867
There's some time for this too!

1331
01:50:48,041 --> 01:50:49,179
Listen.

1332
01:50:51,512 --> 01:50:53,116
How do I look?

1333
01:50:53,213 --> 01:50:54,692
Mv god...

1334
01:50:54,749 --> 01:50:56,160
...carefu|!

1335
01:50:56,917 --> 01:50:58,021
Here you go.

1336
01:50:58,119 --> 01:51:00,690
If I knew you opened a
restaurant here every night...

1337
01:51:00,787 --> 01:51:02,266
...then I would have
given you company.

1338
01:51:02,323 --> 01:51:03,324
What's the name of your restaurant?

1339
01:51:03,390 --> 01:51:06,200
Prem Dilwala Restaurant.
- Nice name.

1340
01:51:06,260 --> 01:51:08,297
What was the menu day before?
- Vegetable Curry.

1341
01:51:08,462 --> 01:51:11,341
And yesterday?
- Baked peas.

1342
01:51:11,399 --> 01:51:14,107
And today?
- Buttered Okra.

1343
01:51:14,168 --> 01:51:16,148
Buttered Okra!
- Yes.

1344
01:51:18,239 --> 01:51:19,843
Sometimes you don't
act like a Princess.

1345
01:51:19,907 --> 01:51:23,582
Why? Have I become too
naughty these days? - No, no!

1346
01:51:30,518 --> 01:51:35,968
The thing is...when I'm happy
I become free!

1347
01:51:39,026 --> 01:51:40,835
But now I'll be a good girl.

1348
01:51:40,928 --> 01:51:44,034
I want to eat okra too.
- No it's too spicy.

1349
01:51:44,865 --> 01:51:47,539
‘It's all in the mind!‘

1350
01:51:52,472 --> 01:51:55,851
Please sit up...
- Never!

1351
01:51:56,243 --> 01:51:58,519
We have to share everything.

1352
01:52:09,390 --> 01:52:11,495
We'll share everything...

1353
01:52:11,592 --> 01:52:14,198
...highs and lows, ups and downs!

1354
01:52:36,517 --> 01:52:40,158
I want to drink water too.
- Right away.

1355
01:53:05,379 --> 01:53:09,759
These lamps are complaining today...

1356
01:53:09,816 --> 01:53:13,286
‘Why hasn't the wedding
date been fixed yet?‘

1357
01:53:13,387 --> 01:53:17,130
The couple doesn't
get to fix the date...

1358
01:53:18,092 --> 01:53:20,538
...your grandma will fix it.

1359
01:53:27,034 --> 01:53:29,036
You know...

1360
01:53:30,204 --> 01:53:35,620
...I sometimes get the feeling
that you're not the same man...

1361
01:53:35,976 --> 01:53:38,183
...that you're someone else...

1362
01:53:38,245 --> 01:53:41,124
...who's come from far away...

1363
01:53:41,215 --> 01:53:44,287
...to take my loneliness away!

1364
01:53:45,586 --> 01:53:47,532
But you know what...

1365
01:53:48,455 --> 01:53:50,332
...who cares...!

1366
01:53:52,359 --> 01:53:55,397
That day I made you write
several complaints...

1367
01:53:55,462 --> 01:53:59,535
...today I'll speak again and you write...

1368
01:54:00,167 --> 01:54:02,579
...but this time on my back!

1369
01:54:06,273 --> 01:54:11,273
"Had it been
the night of our union.."

1370
01:54:22,422 --> 01:54:29,897
"..I wonder
what would have happened."

1371
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:40,950
"I wonder what would
have happened."

1372
01:54:54,188 --> 01:54:59,968
"Love brings with it
a strange kind of yearning."

1373
01:55:00,594 --> 01:55:06,408
"A yearning evident
in the mind, body, and eyes."

1374
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:12,043
"Darling, come to me."

1375
01:55:12,773 --> 01:55:21,318
"Darling, come to me.
I long for you."

1376
01:55:21,882 --> 01:55:30,961
"I want to spend my life with you."

1377
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:52,954
There's no need to be
so reserved in love.

1378
01:56:03,290 --> 01:56:06,100
Queens used to get adorned here...

1379
01:56:06,360 --> 01:56:09,534
...won't you adorn your Queen tonight?

1380
01:56:16,470 --> 01:56:25,879
"This kind of yearning
sometimes leads to destruction."

1381
01:56:32,119 --> 01:56:38,502
"A clean image gets marred."

1382
01:56:44,765 --> 01:56:51,148
"Examples of change of heart
are a many."

1383
01:56:51,205 --> 01:56:56,587
"Beautiful dreams make me yearn."

1384
01:56:57,477 --> 01:57:03,018
"Yearning full of
need and indulgence."

1385
01:57:03,717 --> 01:57:11,795
"Come to me, darling.
I yearn for you."

1386
01:57:12,359 --> 01:57:21,905
"I want to spend my life with you."

1387
01:57:30,544 --> 01:57:32,956
Remember this place?

1388
01:57:33,780 --> 01:57:38,456
It's the same place
where I fought with you...

1389
01:57:38,752 --> 01:57:41,062
...over something...

1390
01:57:42,789 --> 01:57:47,534
...imagine that the same
barbecue is set up there...

1391
01:57:49,730 --> 01:57:52,973
...I've worn your favourite
dress again...

1392
01:57:53,066 --> 01:57:54,568
...and...

1393
01:58:00,640 --> 01:58:10,118
"Your love and affection
is not meant for me."

1394
01:58:16,389 --> 01:58:22,772
"Stop yourself
from getting attracted to me."

1395
01:58:29,002 --> 01:58:35,351
"Undeserved love will
take away peace of mind."

1396
01:58:35,442 --> 01:58:40,824
"Feel the yearning in my breath."

1397
01:58:41,681 --> 01:58:47,427
"The tinkling of my anklets and bangles
give away the yearning inside me."

1398
01:58:48,054 --> 01:58:50,432
"Come to me, darling."

1399
01:58:53,360 --> 01:58:56,170
"I yearn for you."

1400
01:58:56,596 --> 01:59:05,448
"I want to spend my life with you."

1401
01:59:07,174 --> 01:59:12,920
"I want to spend my life with you."

1402
01:59:12,979 --> 01:59:19,157
"I want to spend my life with you."

1403
01:59:19,419 --> 01:59:24,767
"I want to spend my life with you."

1404
01:59:24,858 --> 01:59:31,742
"I want to spend.."

1405
01:59:31,798 --> 01:59:36,076
"..my life with you."

1406
01:59:40,974 --> 01:59:46,048
What if I tell you
I have no right to this?

1407
01:59:49,149 --> 01:59:55,065
The love I gave you in these
past four days was false, Princess.

1408
02:00:15,308 --> 02:00:21,918
Grandma says that true love resides
not on the |ips...but in the eyes...

1409
02:00:22,949 --> 02:00:27,864
...and your eyes are reflecting
your true love, Your Majesty!

1410
02:00:38,732 --> 02:00:40,769
Deewan Saheb!

1411
02:00:42,402 --> 02:00:43,938
Who is it?

1412
02:00:53,546 --> 02:00:55,548
Your Highness?

1413
02:00:55,715 --> 02:00:58,252
I'm back Deewan Saheb...

1414
02:00:58,318 --> 02:01:00,059
...I'm back.

1415
02:01:02,055 --> 02:01:03,659
Your Highness!

1416
02:01:12,232 --> 02:01:13,336
Dilwale?

1417
02:01:13,567 --> 02:01:18,107
Bapu, I can deceive you as the Prince...

1418
02:01:19,906 --> 02:01:23,251
...but I can't deceive
the Princess anymore.

1419
02:01:24,544 --> 02:01:32,224
Bapu, let the pride of the
royal family stay in the royal family.

1420
02:01:35,889 --> 02:01:38,563
Why did I come here to meet her?

1421
02:01:38,658 --> 02:01:40,638
Why did I stay here?

1422
02:01:41,027 --> 02:01:43,633
Why couldn't I understand this before?

1423
02:01:44,397 --> 02:01:48,368
Bapu, we must bring the Prince back.

1424
02:01:49,669 --> 02:01:51,649
So you...?
- Sir.

1425
02:01:53,273 --> 02:01:56,083
What is it Sanjay?
Any news of the Prince?

1426
02:01:56,142 --> 02:01:57,485
No sir.

1427
02:01:57,777 --> 02:02:03,022
But there's someone who claims
he can take us to the Prince.

1428
02:02:03,616 --> 02:02:06,495
Happy Diwali Deewan Saheb.

1429
02:02:08,255 --> 02:02:10,394
Prem Dilwale.

1430
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:15,499
Prem Dilwala.

1431
02:02:15,795 --> 02:02:17,934
City Ayodhya.

1432
02:02:18,398 --> 02:02:20,344
Devotee of Lord Rama.

1433
02:02:20,700 --> 02:02:23,977
I must admit Deewan Saheb...

1434
02:02:24,170 --> 02:02:28,482
...that even at this age
you did all this so cleverly.

1435
02:02:28,575 --> 02:02:31,078
But you made one mistake...

1436
02:02:32,345 --> 02:02:39,490
...you kept an 80 year old watchman
to take care of the Prince!

1437
02:03:10,650 --> 02:03:16,430
The effect of the injection
will last 3 to 4 hours. Take him away!

1438
02:03:25,999 --> 02:03:29,412
Congratulations Prem Dilwale.

1439
02:03:29,502 --> 02:03:32,244
Your desire is fulfilled.

1440
02:03:33,306 --> 02:03:36,048
Now the Princess can be yours.

1441
02:03:36,109 --> 02:03:40,580
The Princess can be yours.

1442
02:03:41,848 --> 02:03:43,828
Every loyal person
has the same fate.

1443
02:03:45,385 --> 02:03:48,423
Get to the point.
Why have you come here?

1444
02:03:48,488 --> 02:03:53,369
I'll take Dilwale to the same
place where I'm holding the Prince.

1445
02:03:53,459 --> 02:03:56,804
In exchange,
I want Chuttan's freedom.

1446
02:03:56,963 --> 02:03:58,374
And for one day tomorrow...

1447
02:03:58,432 --> 02:04:02,346
...I want Kanhaiya and
Dilwala in the same roles...

1448
02:04:02,402 --> 02:04:04,575
...that you've had them play so far.

1449
02:04:04,671 --> 02:04:05,741
Why?

1450
02:04:05,872 --> 02:04:08,785
It's Diwali time Deewan Saheb.

1451
02:04:09,409 --> 02:04:13,824
Let's play a few rounds of cards.
What do you say Dilwale?

1452
02:04:16,416 --> 02:04:19,397
Does Ajay know you're here?

1453
02:04:19,686 --> 02:04:21,825
vvhapsanjav?

1454
02:04:24,123 --> 02:04:25,534
Get out of here!

1455
02:04:25,892 --> 02:04:27,963
You're one of Ajay's best friends...

1456
02:04:28,061 --> 02:04:30,166
...at least don't deceive him!

1457
02:04:30,263 --> 02:04:33,403
Get out!
We don't accept your deal.

1458
02:04:35,268 --> 02:04:37,839
I'll come with you.

1459
02:04:40,106 --> 02:04:43,451
Allow me one more mistake
Deewan Saheb.

1460
02:04:44,911 --> 02:04:47,084
For the Princess‘ sake!

1461
02:04:51,951 --> 02:04:53,624
Your MajeSIY?

1462
02:04:56,823 --> 02:04:58,359
vijav?

1463
02:05:00,827 --> 02:05:04,969
‘I'm going out to
get your wedding gift!‘

1464
02:05:24,584 --> 02:05:27,895
Here's that Sheesh Mahal...

1465
02:05:36,896 --> 02:05:39,740
...this is where Vijay
Singh is imprisoned.

1466
02:05:39,799 --> 02:05:43,542
Ajay is celebrating
Chuttan's freedom here.

1467
02:05:46,205 --> 02:05:48,151
Freedom!

1468
02:05:51,778 --> 02:05:52,848
Hey!

1469
02:05:59,219 --> 02:06:01,426
Someone else is here today...

1470
02:06:01,487 --> 02:06:05,492
...who wants to be a
part of your happiness.

1471
02:06:06,659 --> 02:06:10,163
Sir now that we've
achieved our goal...

1472
02:06:10,430 --> 02:06:13,138
...what orders do
you have for this poor soul?

1473
02:06:13,199 --> 02:06:16,840
Deewan Saheb turned
him into a puppet.

1474
02:06:33,253 --> 02:06:41,195
Under my reign, no one has
to dance to anyone's tunes.

1475
02:06:53,006 --> 02:06:54,280
Sir.

1476
02:06:55,108 --> 02:07:00,023
Sir to make today's victory
memorable, let's take a picture...

1477
02:07:00,046 --> 02:07:02,026
...with you dressed in
the Late King's attire.

1478
02:07:02,181 --> 02:07:05,890
I've got the dress here and
I've got a great photographer.

1479
02:07:05,952 --> 02:07:07,488
Mr. Masoorie!

1480
02:07:07,720 --> 02:07:10,064
Greetings.
- Come on.

1481
02:07:28,674 --> 02:07:30,381
Follow me!

1482
02:07:30,610 --> 02:07:34,251
I want to see these
two brothers battle.

1483
02:07:34,313 --> 02:07:36,020
Just like it's in the books.

1484
02:07:36,182 --> 02:07:40,460
Whoever dies, one will
end up in the royal cemetery...

1485
02:07:40,686 --> 02:07:44,463
...and the other will
be royally escorted to jail.

1486
02:07:44,891 --> 02:07:50,204
The Late King built this mirror
maze for his children to play in...

1487
02:07:50,263 --> 02:07:55,474
...|itt|e did he know that one
day his lineage would end here.

1488
02:08:11,484 --> 02:08:18,060
This is Vijay Singh's fury...
eager to avenge every traitor!

1489
02:08:23,129 --> 02:08:26,110
Here's the key to his freedom...

1490
02:08:26,533 --> 02:08:31,744
...if you can, save your Lord Rama
from committing a sin!

1491
02:08:58,498 --> 02:09:00,273
RBI-i Bhaiya!

1492
02:09:07,773 --> 02:09:09,810
‘Congratulations Prem Di|wa|e!'

1493
02:09:09,875 --> 02:09:12,014
‘Now the Princess can be yours.‘

1494
02:09:12,111 --> 02:09:13,954
‘The Princess can be yours.‘

1495
02:09:14,013 --> 02:09:15,856
‘The Princess can be yours.‘

1496
02:09:23,489 --> 02:09:27,801
Di|wa|e...the Princess can be yours.

1497
02:09:40,606 --> 02:09:44,281
My not trusting you...means your death.

1498
02:09:44,577 --> 02:09:47,285
Aren't you scared of death?

1499
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:51,526
If I had made a mistake...I
would be scared.

1500
02:09:55,688 --> 02:10:00,000
I've come to take you
back to your Princess...

1501
02:10:00,226 --> 02:10:01,967
...where your sisters
are waiting for you...

1502
02:10:02,828 --> 02:10:05,672
...your family is waiting for you.

1503
02:10:05,798 --> 02:10:07,175
No!

1504
02:10:07,433 --> 02:10:11,609
I have no family!
They're all selfish!

1505
02:10:12,071 --> 02:10:15,848
A brother goes to meet his sister,
but she calls a lawyer!

1506
02:10:15,909 --> 02:10:17,980
A brother tries to kill his brother!

1507
02:10:18,044 --> 02:10:20,149
Is this what you call a family?

1508
02:10:20,346 --> 02:10:22,417
I'll kill Ajay!

1509
02:10:24,150 --> 02:10:29,463
Why do you want to tarnish the
reputation of the princess‘ fiance?

1510
02:10:34,994 --> 02:10:37,270
Every family has problems...

1511
02:10:37,496 --> 02:10:41,467
...but blessed are
those who have a family!

1512
02:10:42,668 --> 02:10:44,579
Well said Dilwale!

1513
02:10:44,637 --> 02:10:47,117
But families also have a rule...

1514
02:10:47,206 --> 02:10:51,086
...the one at fault gets punished!

1515
02:10:51,143 --> 02:10:53,316
Wait Raja Bhaiya!
- Enough!

1516
02:10:53,612 --> 02:10:58,618
For your sake I'll give Ajay Singh
an opportunity...to put up a fight!

1517
02:11:07,093 --> 02:11:08,731
RBI-i Bhaiya!

1518
02:11:09,729 --> 02:11:11,436
Stop, Raja Bhaiya!

1519
02:11:28,414 --> 02:11:32,157
You managed to escape one maze...

1520
02:11:32,718 --> 02:11:36,666
...but fate won't always favour you.

1521
02:11:40,359 --> 02:11:43,363
Now no one can stop the battle!

1522
02:11:56,743 --> 02:11:58,245
Get up!

1523
02:12:10,289 --> 02:12:12,565
Get up Bhaisaheb!

1524
02:12:54,367 --> 02:12:55,607
Forgive me!

1525
02:13:47,353 --> 02:13:51,927
"Friendship with brother,
fun with sisters."

1526
02:13:51,991 --> 02:13:56,497
"A heart like a kite in the sky."

1527
02:13:56,595 --> 02:14:01,135
"A|| these were
relationships of the heart."

1528
02:14:01,233 --> 02:14:05,511
"With neither doubt nor jealousy."

1529
02:14:05,772 --> 02:14:10,084
"There were no disagreements"

1530
02:14:10,142 --> 02:14:15,182
"Mirro, take me back
to my childhood."

1531
02:14:54,153 --> 02:14:56,064
Raja Bhaiya, enough!

1532
02:14:56,589 --> 02:14:57,897
He's your brother.

1533
02:14:57,990 --> 02:14:59,697
He's my enemy!

1534
02:15:00,559 --> 02:15:03,733
If that's so,
then excuse me.

1535
02:15:20,713 --> 02:15:25,719
Why such brotherly love for
your enemy, Raja Bhaiya?

1536
02:15:30,723 --> 02:15:35,103
If you hit it's a punishment.
But if someone else hits it's a crime.

1537
02:15:35,261 --> 02:15:38,208
This only happens in blood relations...

1538
02:15:38,364 --> 02:15:40,071
...in families.

1539
02:15:41,200 --> 02:15:43,146
That's not true!

1540
02:15:44,236 --> 02:15:47,012
If that's not true...
then there's your brother...

1541
02:15:47,072 --> 02:15:49,074
...go kill him!

1542
02:15:58,984 --> 02:16:04,161
Raja Bhaiya, you're still
hiding your feelings...

1543
02:16:04,323 --> 02:16:06,462
...why don't you tell your brother...

1544
02:16:06,525 --> 02:16:10,371
...'I'm very lonely!
Let's go home.‘

1545
02:16:11,731 --> 02:16:15,543
And you,
look into your brother's eyes!

1546
02:16:15,968 --> 02:16:21,145
Is it possible that he wouldn't
fulfill any of your desires?

1547
02:16:21,307 --> 02:16:25,983
You let the world convince you
to kill your own brother?

1548
02:16:29,248 --> 02:16:31,524
All you siblings are
bound by the same link...

1549
02:16:31,584 --> 02:16:35,726
...you're all looking for that same love
that you lost in this Sheesh Mahal...

1550
02:16:35,788 --> 02:16:38,792
...on|y your ways of looking are wrong!

1551
02:17:39,485 --> 02:17:40,930
Bhaiya!

1552
02:18:10,082 --> 02:18:12,619
What are you doing here?
Get lost!

1553
02:18:13,252 --> 02:18:15,425
Anyone else?

1554
02:18:35,641 --> 02:18:39,680
How do brothers ask for
forgiveness, Bhaisaheb?

1555
02:18:39,912 --> 02:18:42,324
By hugging each other.

1556
02:18:43,215 --> 02:18:47,527
Then hug me gently,
I'm in a lot of pain.

1557
02:18:47,886 --> 02:18:50,059
Come here!

1558
02:19:10,042 --> 02:19:13,285
It's not over yet Your Highness!

1559
02:20:18,977 --> 02:20:24,689
‘Imagine that I've worn your
favourite dress again...and...'

1560
02:21:03,789 --> 02:21:06,599
You can go in Princess.

1561
02:21:07,192 --> 02:21:11,265
To the one, who truly belongs to you.

1562
02:21:15,667 --> 02:21:20,616
Forgive me, but the one you
were spending time with so far...

1563
02:21:20,806 --> 02:21:22,717
had been planted by me.

1564
02:22:10,322 --> 02:22:13,064
The old wounds have healed completely.

1565
02:22:13,258 --> 02:22:19,265
Now His Majesty needs
to eat and rest well.

1566
02:22:20,432 --> 02:22:23,208
Goodnight sir.
- Goodnight Doctor.

1567
02:22:36,148 --> 02:22:40,927
I am sorry that you had
to go through this embarrassment.

1568
02:22:45,057 --> 02:22:46,365
Thank you!

1569
02:22:47,859 --> 02:22:52,308
Your Majesty,
Dilwala is here to see you.

1570
02:22:56,801 --> 02:22:58,109
Just a second.

1571
02:23:00,072 --> 02:23:02,382
You want to go inside for a bit?

1572
02:23:03,775 --> 02:23:05,254
Thank you.

1573
02:23:06,879 --> 02:23:09,519
Deewan Saheb, send him in.

1574
02:23:17,289 --> 02:23:22,170
Your Majesty, before anyone
discovers our secret...

1575
02:23:22,360 --> 02:23:24,966
...Di|wa|a has come to take your leave.

1576
02:23:28,033 --> 02:23:32,504
Okay...Papa's car will go drop him
Deewan Saheb.

1577
02:23:32,604 --> 02:23:33,674
Yes.

1578
02:23:34,473 --> 02:23:36,077
Goodbye Sir.

1579
02:23:40,678 --> 02:23:44,649
Dilwale,
you've broken many traditions...

1580
02:23:44,716 --> 02:23:47,959
...you made the royal
guests play footballm.

1581
02:23:48,053 --> 02:23:52,195
...you told everyone thatI
used to bathe naked in the lake!

1582
02:23:55,627 --> 02:23:58,699
And you didn't keep
a moustache either...

1583
02:24:00,031 --> 02:24:01,374
...why?

1584
02:24:02,567 --> 02:24:06,674
Sir, it made your Princess happy!

1585
02:24:12,878 --> 02:24:17,486
Thank you...I can't
stop you from leaving...

1586
02:24:17,716 --> 02:24:22,096
...but tell me, what can I do for you.

1587
02:24:25,057 --> 02:24:27,731
You're a very good son...

1588
02:24:28,092 --> 02:24:30,197
...you're a very good brother...

1589
02:24:30,962 --> 02:24:33,772
...can't you be that companion...

1590
02:24:35,133 --> 02:24:38,774
that the Princess
is looking for in you?

1591
02:24:45,143 --> 02:24:48,488
Okay, I will try my best.

1592
02:24:49,581 --> 02:24:52,562
Raja Bhaiya, one more request...

1593
02:24:57,589 --> 02:24:58,932
Kanhaiya!

1594
02:24:59,491 --> 02:25:01,801
Give me this...
- No this one.

1595
02:25:07,832 --> 02:25:11,211
We had brought these
gifts for the Princess, will you...

1596
02:25:11,336 --> 02:25:12,781
Sure.

1597
02:26:04,923 --> 02:26:07,961
Bapu, I'll take your leave.

1598
02:26:11,229 --> 02:26:15,041
Do visit us some day...for quality time!

1599
02:26:20,171 --> 02:26:23,584
And Bapu you didn't
answer that question.

1600
02:26:23,675 --> 02:26:27,851
You can tell me today...
I'm leaving and there's nobody around.

1601
02:26:30,916 --> 02:26:37,333
While taking care of the royal family,
I didn't get any time...

1602
02:26:40,292 --> 02:26:43,796
Now if you ask anything else
I'll slap you!

1603
02:26:56,274 --> 02:26:58,481
Go away from here...go!

1604
02:27:13,458 --> 02:27:14,698
Sit.

1605
02:27:36,214 --> 02:27:44,258
"You are as enchanting as
all the scriptures put together."

1606
02:27:48,293 --> 02:27:56,075
"A symbol of virtue and truth,
just like Sita."

1607
02:28:45,316 --> 02:28:48,092
0m!

1608
02:28:50,488 --> 02:28:52,161
New drama?

1609
02:28:53,391 --> 02:28:55,098
Come friends.

1610
02:28:55,260 --> 02:28:58,434
Take your seats...faster!

1611
02:28:59,797 --> 02:29:01,401
Dear friends...

1612
02:29:01,666 --> 02:29:07,344
...ear|y morning Lord Vishnu
visited me in my dream!

1613
02:29:07,706 --> 02:29:10,346
He said 'Chaubey...hey Chaubey!‘

1614
02:29:11,042 --> 02:29:12,680
‘Become pure.‘

1615
02:29:12,777 --> 02:29:16,725
And he also said that...

1616
02:29:16,814 --> 02:29:22,526
...'Chaubey you should stay
in touch with the rich and famous!‘

1617
02:29:22,620 --> 02:29:25,157
So why don't you invite
the King here sometime?

1618
02:29:25,356 --> 02:29:28,303
Or better still, take me there...

1619
02:29:28,359 --> 02:29:30,396
...for tea...

1620
02:29:31,329 --> 02:29:33,570
Om!
<i>‘</i> No!

1621
02:29:33,732 --> 02:29:35,336
Oh!

1622
02:29:35,934 --> 02:29:37,675
Chaubey uncle.

1623
02:29:37,869 --> 02:29:41,874
Prem Bhaiya,
Grandma from the royal family is here...

1624
02:29:50,916 --> 02:29:52,657
Grandma!

1625
02:30:11,269 --> 02:30:15,445
In all these years I've never
seen such a blissful Diwali.

1626
02:30:15,506 --> 02:30:17,508
The royal family of Pritampur...

1627
02:30:17,609 --> 02:30:22,615
...is joyfully celebrating
unique festivities...

1628
02:30:22,680 --> 02:30:24,853
...a|| because of you!

1629
02:30:28,252 --> 02:30:31,392
You've given us this gift...

1630
02:30:31,589 --> 02:30:35,127
...and there is a tradition
in our royal families...

1631
02:30:35,193 --> 02:30:39,699
...we give a gift
in exchange of a gift!

1632
02:31:16,534 --> 02:31:18,070
Dilwale.

1633
02:31:18,803 --> 02:31:22,580
We fought a lot after
we got engaged...

1634
02:31:22,707 --> 02:31:26,018
...we tried to humiliate each other.

1635
02:31:26,077 --> 02:31:32,494
But after you left, I tried
to be the one you asked me to be...

1636
02:31:37,956 --> 02:31:42,462
...and I said nothing to
her, nor did I interrupt her...

1637
02:31:43,094 --> 02:31:45,404
...just listened.

1638
02:31:45,764 --> 02:31:49,302
And we both came to
the conclusion that...

1639
02:31:50,134 --> 02:31:55,641
...the companion that our Princess
has been looking for...

1640
02:31:56,140 --> 02:31:58,677
...is our very own Dilwala.

1641
02:31:59,143 --> 02:32:01,020
Prem Dilwala!

1642
02:32:05,149 --> 02:32:09,222
The Princess belongs
to the royal family.

1643
02:32:09,287 --> 02:32:11,699
If the royal family
is what's separating us...

1644
02:32:11,756 --> 02:32:15,704
...then you'll have to
include us in your family today.

1645
02:32:15,760 --> 02:32:21,267
As you know, I don't know
how to talk filmy nor do I like it...

1646
02:32:21,365 --> 02:32:23,572
...but I'm still trying.

1647
02:32:23,968 --> 02:32:28,383
Two days after Diwali,
today is Bhaidooj (Brother's Day)...

1648
02:32:29,574 --> 02:32:32,077
...we'|| celebrate it this year!

1649
02:33:14,219 --> 02:33:16,426
Sisters celebrate this festival...

1650
02:33:17,288 --> 02:33:20,292
...but it's called Brother's Day...

1651
02:33:23,227 --> 02:33:29,041
...this brother too wants to be
a part of your family!

1652
02:33:36,875 --> 02:33:39,014
Our families are no longer separate...

1653
02:33:39,076 --> 02:33:43,286
we are now one family...
which Prem has brought together!

1654
02:33:44,649 --> 02:33:46,651
Any other order?

1655
02:33:54,992 --> 02:33:58,405
"My heart beats faster."

1656
02:34:00,298 --> 02:34:04,007
"My heart is racing."

1657
02:34:17,782 --> 02:34:23,357
"He's with me. I like him.
I will accept whatever he |ikes."

1658
02:34:23,421 --> 02:34:29,133
"He means more to me than my life.
I will do everything for him."

1659
02:34:31,963 --> 02:34:37,641
"He's with me. I like him.
I will accept whatever he |ikes."

1660
02:34:37,702 --> 02:34:43,448
"He means more to me than my life.
I will do everything for him."

1661
02:34:45,910 --> 02:34:51,485
"Let me buy something sweet
and spicy, something he |ikes."

1662
02:34:51,583 --> 02:34:57,124
"Let me buy some
snacks and confectionary."

1663
02:34:57,621 --> 02:35:03,196
"I have to say it to him today."

1664
02:35:03,260 --> 02:35:08,869
"I have to say it to him today."

1665
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:17,376
"I have found the treasure of love."

1666
02:35:17,742 --> 02:35:20,518
"I have found the treasure of love."

1667
02:35:20,578 --> 02:35:24,458
"I feel overwhelmed
on finding my love."

1668
02:35:25,350 --> 02:35:29,924
"I have found the treasure of love."

1669
02:35:29,988 --> 02:35:34,334
"I have found the treasure of love."

1670
02:35:34,692 --> 02:35:38,765
"I feel overwhelmed
on finding my love."

1671
02:35:39,497 --> 02:35:44,378
"I have found the treasure of love."

1672
02:36:01,719 --> 02:36:10,867
"Darkness was all around me.
My dear ones were far away."

1673
02:36:11,562 --> 02:36:20,482
"I know now the value of
dreams and relationships."

1674
02:36:21,105 --> 02:36:25,815
"I understand love now."

1675
02:36:25,910 --> 02:36:30,154
"Nobody cared for me
like you did."

1676
02:36:30,448 --> 02:36:34,954
"Rubbed off me
have these qualities of yours."

1677
02:36:35,019 --> 02:36:39,661
"I have found love."

1678
02:36:39,757 --> 02:36:43,637
"I have found love."

1679
02:36:43,828 --> 02:36:46,104
"I have found the treasure of love."

1680
02:36:46,163 --> 02:36:48,473
"I have found the treasure of love."

1681
02:36:48,533 --> 02:36:52,379
"I feel overwhelmed
that I have found love."

1682
02:36:53,304 --> 02:36:58,583
"I have found the treasure of love."

1683
02:36:59,577 --> 02:37:00,612
"He conquered."

1684
02:37:01,979 --> 02:37:03,151
"He came."

1685
02:37:04,248 --> 02:37:05,420
"He brought love."

1686
02:37:06,684 --> 02:37:07,788
"I have found love."

1687
02:37:09,020 --> 02:37:10,499
"I have found love."
