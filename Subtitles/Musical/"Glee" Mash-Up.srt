1
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,842
My weave!

2
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:37,059
- What the hell, Karofsky?
- Oh, I've wanted to do that ever since fifth grade...

3
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,002
when you made fun of me for getting pubes.

4
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:43,065
Now that you've joined Lullaby Lee's and
insperminated the queen of the Chastity Ball...

5
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,441
and dropped below us
hockey dudes on the food chain?

6
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,742
- It's open season.
- Screw you, Karofsky!

7
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:50,146
You and your Neanderthal puck-heads
are nothing!

8
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,844
- You're gonna pay for this, dude!
- No, I'm not.

9
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:56,252
You two don't have the juice anymore.
Welcome to the new world order.

10
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,498
Mm-hmm.

11
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,095
- Hey, guys.
- We need to talk.

12
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,198
Okay.

13
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:19,041
As you know, even though she refuses
to wear the ring and won't tell anyone...

14
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:22,013
including her mother... about the engagement,
Emma and I are, in fact, getting married.

15
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,882
Yes. Ken convinced me we need to at least be in
the same room when the marriage is certified.

16
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,783
<i>What can I say? I'm a traditionalist.</i>

17
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:30,379
We're going to Hawaii
and getting married on the beach.

18
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:34,118
And you want me to come?

19
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:37,652
No, no, no, no. I picked Hawaii,
because it's far away from everybody we know.

20
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,358
- Oh.
- Uh, the thing is...

21
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,561
is that after a very brief,
private ceremony...

22
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:45,866
Ken has decided he would
like to have a first dance.

23
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,373
The problem is, we can't decide on the song.

24
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,841
Yes. I would like to have
"I Could've Danced All Night."

25
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,140
<i>Oh, from My Fair Lady.</i>

26
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,579
Great choice. Such a romantic song.

27
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:57,775
Yes.

28
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,581
Yeah, if you're making a mixed tape
for the boring parade.

29
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:04,419
I want the "Thong Song."

30
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:07,426
I need something
I can shake my moneymaker to.

31
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,394
Um...

32
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:14,058
Uh, I was remembering, um,
that you did those, uh...

33
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,159
- mash-up things with the Glee kids, right?
- Uh-huh.

34
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:19,831
So I thought maybe you could find a way
to use both of our songs.

35
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:23,034
Um, and I... well, we...

36
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,771
both need... want... need dance lessons.

37
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:28,541
<i>Yeah, l-l...
I mean, I might need a bit of polishing...</i>

38
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,412
but it's the Emster here
you really have to work with.

39
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,883
<i>Had a monster case of athlete's foot
a couple years back.</i>

40
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,886
Had to get all my toenails removed.

41
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:38,549
So if she steps on my feet during the dance,
I might pass out.

42
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,458
We would, uh, be very happy
to pay you for your time, Will.

43
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:45,259
No. No, I want to give you these lessons
as a wedding gift.

44
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,067
Sound good?

45
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,568
- Hmm!
- Great.

46
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,628
This is a disaster.

47
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:56,641
Our reputation as McKinley High's "it" couple
is in serious jeopardy...

48
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:00,304
if we don't find some way
to be cool again, Finn.

49
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,214
- The Slushee war has commenced.
- And if Finn and Quinn got nailed,
none of us are safe.

50
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,912
Okay, guys.
We're a little behind for sectionals...

51
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:09,580
thanks to our Sue Sylvester detour.

52
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,954
But you guys seem to really
enjoy doing mash-ups, right?

53
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,617
And I'm gonna keep you guys fired up.

54
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,890
Plus, there's an important lesson
to be learned with mash-ups.

55
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,397
Sometimes things are so different,
they don't feel like they go together.

56
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:22,992
<i>But the big difference between them
is what makes them great.</i>

57
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,163
Like... chocolate and bacon.

58
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,968
Or Glee Club and football.

59
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,568
<i>Exactly. But you've proven
that it is a great combination.</i>

60
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,168
<i>So...</i>

61
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:33,513
here is...
my personal favorite song.

62
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:37,609
here is...
my personal favorite song.

63
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:41,984
And your homework for the week
is to find an unexpected mash-up to go with it.

64
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,923
- "Bust a Move"?
- Yeah, this song is old school.

65
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,051
- All right. Um, Artie.
- Yeah?

66
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,925
Try to follow along on the bass.
Finn, take us through it.

67
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:55,366
Uh, I'm sorry, Mr. Schuester.
I got corn syrup in my eye.

68
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:58,165
Okay. Uh, Puck. How about it?

69
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,832
I don't really groove on Young MC.

70
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,934
I am shocked at the lack
of leading-man ambition in this room right now.

71
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:09,641
It's okay, Rachel. I guess I'm gonna have to
show these guys how it's done.

72
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,786
Bust it!

73
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:24,128
¶¶ This here's a tale
for all the fellas ¶¶

74
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,358
¶¶ Tryin' to do what
those ladies tell us ¶¶

75
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,229
¶¶ Get shot down 'cause
you're overzealous ¶¶

76
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,292
¶¶ Play hard to get
Females get jealous ¶¶

77
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,203
¶¶ Okay, smarty, go to a party
Girls are scantily clad and showin' body¶¶

78
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,366
¶¶ A chick walks by and you
wish you could sex her ¶¶

79
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,841
¶¶ But you're standin' on the wall
like you was Poindexter ¶¶

80
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,639
¶¶ Movie's showin'
So you're goin' ¶¶

81
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:41,805
<i>¶¶ Could care less about
the five you're blowin' ¶¶</i>

82
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,372
¶¶ Theater gets dark
just to start the show ¶¶

83
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,678
<i>¶¶ Then you spot a fine woman
sittin' in your row ¶¶</i>

84
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,845
¶¶ She's dressed in yellow
She says hello ¶¶

85
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,478
¶¶ Come sit next to me
you fine fellow ¶¶

86
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,716
<i>¶¶ You run over there
without a second to lose ¶¶</i>

87
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,487
¶¶ And what comes next
Hey, bust a move ¶¶

88
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,323
¶¶ Hey, you want it ¶¶

89
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,364
<i>¶¶ You got it ¶¶</i>

90
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,661
<i>¶¶ Hey, you want it
Baby, you got it ¶¶</i>

91
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:04,294
- ¶¶ Just bust a move ¶¶
- ¶¶ Mmm, you want it ¶¶

92
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,304
¶¶ You got it, uh ¶¶

93
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:09,773
¶¶ Hey, you want it
Baby, you got it ¶¶

94
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,833
¶¶ Your best friend Harry
has a brother Larry ¶¶

95
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,879
¶¶ In five days from now
he's gonna marry ¶¶

96
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:16,176
¶¶ He's hopin' you can
make it there if you can ¶¶

97
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,615
¶¶ 'Cause in the ceremony
you'll be the best man ¶¶

98
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,209
¶¶ You say "neato"
Check your libido ¶¶

99
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,913
¶¶ And roll to the church
in your new tuxedo ¶¶

100
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,922
¶¶ The bride walks down
just to start the wedding ¶¶

101
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,049
¶¶ And there's one more girl
you won't be getting ¶¶

102
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,355
<i>¶¶ So you start thinkin'
then you start blinkin' ¶¶</i>

103
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,918
¶¶ A bride maid looks and thinks
that you're winkin' ¶¶

104
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,623
¶¶ She thinks you're kinda cute
so she winks back ¶¶

105
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,962
¶¶ And now you're feelin' really fine
'cause the girl is stacked ¶¶

106
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,796
¶¶ Reception's jumpin'
Bass is pumpin' ¶¶

107
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:38,302
¶¶ Look at the girl and your
heart starts thumpin' ¶¶

108
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:40,134
¶¶ Says she wants to dance
to a different groove ¶¶

109
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,231
¶¶ Now you know what to do, "G"
Bust a move ¶¶

110
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:44,708
<i>¶¶ Hey, you want it ¶¶</i>

111
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,574
¶¶ You got it, uh ¶¶

112
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:49,342
¶¶ Ah, you want it
Baby, you got it ¶¶

113
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:52,782
- ¶¶ Just bust a move ¶¶
- ¶¶ Mmm, you want it ¶¶

114
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,911
¶¶ You got it, uh ¶¶

115
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:57,046
¶¶ Hey, you want it
Baby, you got it ¶¶

116
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,990
<i>¶¶ Move it, boy ¶¶</i>

117
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:05,561
¶¶ Uh-huh
Yeah ¶¶

118
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,901
¶¶ Uh-huh
Hey, yeah ¶¶

119
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:14,871
- ¶¶ Just bust a move ¶¶
- ¶¶ Yeah ¶¶¶¶

120
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:23,143
So, how can I, uh... how can
I help you kids?

121
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,845
Is it, uh,
too many friends on MySpace, or...

122
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,480
<i>I can't believe we're saying this...</i>

123
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,184
but we need some advice on how to be cool.

124
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,659
Yeah, you must have picked up some ideas...

125
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:39,129
about what cool people do
from watching them over the years.

126
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:40,961
Not that you were never cool yourself.

127
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,024
Yeah... Eh... Well...

128
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,161
Um... But, um, you're two of...

129
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,297
the most popular kids in school.

130
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:49,705
<i>We were... until we joined Glee Club.</i>

131
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,370
<i>That's why he got a Slushee facial.
I'm sure of it.</i>

132
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,972
Okay. I see. Um, don't really have any...

133
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:58,448
pamphlets on how to be popular.

134
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,543
Uh, okay, right. Well, let's talk about this.

135
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,020
Why is it so important for you to be cool?

136
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,456
Huh? Don't you like being in Glee? It's fun.

137
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:09,290
Status is like currency.
When your bank account is full...

138
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:12,354
you can get away with doing
just about anything.

139
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:16,266
But right now, we're like toxic assets.

140
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,895
When my mom applied to college...

141
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:22,463
<i>she put being popular as her
main extracurricular activity.</i>

142
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,511
<i>And she got into Arizona State.</i>

143
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,546
Sunglasses are so sexy.

144
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,383
Sunglasses.

145
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,148
Yeah, sunglasses are, um, really, really cool.

146
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,848
I'm always seeing celebrities wear them...

147
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,413
in magazines, even at night.

148
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,789
Doesn't need to be day. Very popular.

149
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,920
Gives you a sense of mystery. You know... rappers.

150
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,486
Totally.

151
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,658
- You can't see their eyes,
so they have all the power.
- Mmm!

152
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,826
I could be looking at your boobs,
and you'd have no idea.

153
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:56,003
It... Em...
No. Um, no. Kids, look.

154
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:59,533
The most important thing is
that you be yourselves. Okay?

155
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:02,672
And if people don't like you for that,
then I'm sorry, but who needs 'em.

156
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,093
Hi.

157
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,974
Hi.

158
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,409
Hmm.

159
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,550
This is my Cousin Betty's.

160
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:42,053
We were obsessed with Princess Di's dress
when we were little girls...

161
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,919
so, um, when she got married
she insisted on having...

162
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,151
this, uh...

163
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,715
this long train.

164
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:50,421
Is there a reason you... have it on now?

165
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,396
- Yes, yes.
- Okay.

166
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,625
Yeah.

167
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,690
Um, she didn't wear it to her dance rehearsals...

168
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:58,737
and the night of the wedding
her husband kept stepping on the train.

169
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,897
- It was really bad. Their fight was epic.
- Ooh.

170
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:04,170
The priest cried.
They were divorced three months later.

171
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,741
Actually, maybe I shouldn't wear it.

172
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,213
No, no, no, no, no!
It's all good. It's all good.

173
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,274
We'll, uh... We'll see how you move in it.

174
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:13,682
- Right?
- Okay.

175
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:17,382
Okay. Um, so first, uh, let's do Ken's selection...

176
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:20,016
and then, uh, we'll
work in your song for the big finish.

177
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,684
- Okay.
- All right?

178
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,251
Hey, Emma...

179
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,990
I'm really excited about this.

180
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,328
Fantastic. It's... so, so exciting.

181
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,459
This thing right here...

182
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:35,466
is lettin' all the ladies know...

183
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,169
what guys talk about.

184
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,304
You know... the finer things in life.

185
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,678
Check it out.

186
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:47,480
¶¶ Ooh, that dress so scandalous
And you know another guy couldn't handle it ¶¶

187
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,521
¶¶ She's shakin' that thing
like who's the ish ¶¶

188
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,614
¶¶ With a look in your eye
So devilish, uh ¶¶

189
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,215
¶¶ She like to dance
at the hip-hop spots ¶¶

190
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:56,056
¶¶ And she cruise to the crews
like connect the dots ¶¶

191
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:59,188
¶¶ Not just urban, she like the pop
'cause she was "Livin' La Vida Loca" ¶¶

192
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,563
¶¶ She had dumps like a truck
Truck, truck ¶¶

193
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,795
¶¶ Thighs like what
What, what ¶¶

194
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:06,030
¶¶ Baby, move your butt
Butt, butt, uh ¶¶

195
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,663
¶¶ I think I'll sing it again ¶¶

196
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,640
¶¶ She had dumps like a truck
Truck, truck ¶¶

197
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,404
¶¶ Thighs like what
What, what ¶¶

198
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:14,139
¶¶ All night long ¶¶

199
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:17,842
¶¶ Let me see that thong ¶¶

200
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,181
¶¶ Baby ¶¶

201
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,411
¶¶ That th-th-th-th-thong ¶¶

202
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,013
¶¶ I like it when the beat go ¶¶

203
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:28,857
¶¶ Baby, make your booty go ¶¶¶¶

204
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,262
- Good God!
- Are you okay?

205
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,266
- I'm okay. Are you?
- Oh, yes!

206
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,427
Oh, ho! Oh.

207
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:40,371
Ahh.

208
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,108
It's the darn "Thong Song."

209
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:47,407
I don't think it's the song.

210
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,040
I think you need a new dress.

211
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,584
<i>Come on. I'll pick you up.</i>

212
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,017
<i>- Right.
- Upsy-daisy.</i>

213
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:55,553
Oh, I'm stuck.

214
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:58,747
All right.
Let's try, uh, reverse chair on two.

215
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,348
Let's not.

216
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:03,918
Hey, Azimio,
I'm the quarterback. I call the plays.

217
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,432
Some of the guys was talkin' , and we're
starting to question your leadership ability.

218
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,628
<i>Yeah, like maybe you're having trouble
making good choices...</i>

219
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:13,194
as in, for instance,
choosing to join homo explosion.

220
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:16,207
Do I need to remind you that Glee Club
helped us win our first game of the season?

221
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,334
What have you done for me lately?

222
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:21,903
Yeah, we're taking a bunch of heat,
because you like kissing dudes all of a sudden.

223
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,915
You're not being a team player, man.

224
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,974
Can't believe you was man enough
to knock up Quinn Fabray.

225
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:29,078
<i>You sure a real man
didn't sneak in there and do it for you?</i>

226
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,419
That's it!

227
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,424
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight!

228
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:36,984
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight!

229
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,497
- Okay, break it up! Get up!
- Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight!

230
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,534
- Man, get off me!
- Hey, calm down, everybody!

231
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:44,967
On the sidelines and take a knee!

232
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,562
Now!

233
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,108
What if you had broken Finn's arm, huh?

234
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:53,771
We'd be worse off and more pathetic
than we already are.

235
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:56,076
Where's Puckerman?

236
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:59,276
Uh, he said he had to miss practice today.
He's working on something for Glee Club.

237
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:03,082
<i>Is he workin' on his
coming-out-of-the-closet speech or somethin' ?</i>

238
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:05,487
<i>- Hey, man! Don't push me, man!
- Okay, enough!</i>

239
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,459
Football is war.

240
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:12,759
And no one single man can win that war,
not even if they strap nukes on him.

241
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,995
I want you to start acting
like a team again!

242
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,799
When we won that one game,
it wasn't because we were dancing.

243
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,965
<i>It's because we were of singular purpose.</i>

244
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,976
I want you to start hanging more,
spend more time together.

245
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:28,013
Which is why, starting next week...

246
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,981
I'm adding extra practice
on Thursdays at 3:30.

247
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,382
- But, Coach, that's when Glee rehearses.
- You know what?

248
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,443
I have had it up to here
with Schuester and Glee.

249
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:40,322
Here's the story, Quarterback.
And you tell Puckerman this when you see him.

250
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,883
That practice is mandatory. No exceptions.

251
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:47,695
<i>So you're going to have to choose what's
more important to you... football or Glee Club.</i>

252
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:57,605
¶¶ What a girl wants, what a girl needs ¶¶

253
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:01,510
¶¶ Whatever makes me happy
Sets you free ¶¶

254
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,414
¶¶ And I'm thanking you
for knowing exactly ¶¶

255
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:08,817
¶¶ What a girl wants
What a girl needs ¶¶

256
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,448
¶¶ Whatever keeps me
in your arms ¶¶

257
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,754
<i>- ¶¶ And I'm thanking you ¶¶
- I know this looks weird.</i>

258
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,920
<i>- ¶¶ For giving it to me ¶¶¶¶
- But wait until you see what happens next.</i>

259
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:21,194
- My ears are starting to hurt.
Can we take a break?
- Okay.

260
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:24,703
- You wanna make out?
- Sure.

261
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:29,707
<i>I know. It's whack. But I also remember what
my history teacher told us last semester:</i>

262
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:31,936
<i>Only Nixon can go to China.</i>

263
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:35,811
<i>I have no idea what she meant, but it reminded
me of when my family ordered Chinese food...</i>

264
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,872
<i>and sat down together for our traditional...</i>

265
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,248
<i>Simchas Torah screening of Schindler's List.</i>

266
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,617
<i>That's really when all of this started.</i>

267
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:45,282
<i>It wasn't the most normal tradition...</i>

268
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,416
<i>but we did it for my mom.</i>

269
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,961
<i>She said it made her feel
connected to her Jewish roots.</i>

270
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,964
<i>As she was giving me
my sweet-and-sour pork...</i>

271
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,127
<i>she said something that really hit home.</i>

272
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,036
You're no better than them, Noah.

273
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:03,040
Why can't you date a Jewish girl?

274
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:05,736
<i>That night, I had the strangest dream.</i>

275
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:08,371
<i>I knew it was a dream, because there's no way
Rachel could've climbed up the wall...</i>

276
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,881
<i>outside my window with no shoes on.</i>

277
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:23,051
<i>When I woke up, I knew it was more than a dream.
It was a message from God.</i>

278
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:27,224
<i>Rachel was a hot Jew, and the good Lord
wanted me to get into her pants.</i>

279
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:46,744
I picked it up for you when I was buying dip.
It's grape.

280
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:49,617
I know that's your favorite, because the last time
I tossed a grape one in your face...

281
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:52,953
you licked your lips before
you cleaned yourself off.

282
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,960
Hey, I was wondering if you wanted to
work together on some mash-up ideas.

283
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,996
<i>Things happened pretty fast from that point.</i>

284
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:02,397
<i>Getting her to make out with me was easier
than I thought. Guess she's kind of desperate.</i>

285
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:09,471
- You okay, baby?
- I can't do this.

286
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:14,501
Why? We're a couple of good-lookin' Jews.
It's natural.

287
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,743
I-I can't give myself to someone who isn't...

288
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:20,148
brave enough to sing a solo.

289
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:24,087
If you don't have the guts to do that,
then how are you gonna be bold enough to deal...

290
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:28,092
with the ups and downs of loving
an admittedly high-maintenance girl like me?

291
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,458
Are you questioning my badassness?

292
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:34,465
- Have you seen my guns?
- Noah, I'm sorry, but...

293
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,594
Your arms are lovely, but...

294
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,164
I just don't see us working out.

295
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:46,001
<i>So...</i>

296
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:48,569
any ideas for the mash-up?

297
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:51,309
<i>- Anybody?
- No.</i>

298
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:54,045
Oh, come on, guys!

299
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,986
- It's like you're daring me to start dancing.
- Oh, no!

300
00:15:57,056 --> 00:16:00,219
<i>- I've been working on something.
- Oh, yeah?</i>

301
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,659
It's my personal tribute
to a musical Jewish icon.

302
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:08,257
<i>Uh, fantastic. Let's hear it.</i>

303
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:21,076
¶¶ Where it began ¶¶

304
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:26,414
¶¶ I can't begin to know when ¶¶

305
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:30,888
¶¶ But then I know
it's growin' strong ¶¶

306
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,923
¶¶ Was in the spring ¶¶

307
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,622
<i>¶¶ And spring became summer ¶¶</i>

308
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:46,404
<i>¶¶ Who'd have believed
you'd come along ¶¶</i>

309
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,138
¶¶ Hands ¶¶

310
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:56,407
¶¶ Touching hands ¶¶

311
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,576
¶¶ Reachin' out ¶¶

312
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:03,086
<i>¶¶ Touching me ¶¶</i>

313
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:07,592
¶¶ Touching you ¶¶

314
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:12,562
¶¶ Whoa, sweet Caroline ¶¶

315
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:16,590
¶¶ Good times never
seemed so good ¶¶

316
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,272
<i>¶¶ I've been inclined ¶¶</i>

317
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:29,110
¶¶ To believe they never would ¶¶

318
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,840
¶¶ Oh, sweet Caroline ¶¶

319
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:40,455
¶¶ Good times never seemed so good ¶¶

320
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:45,825
¶¶ Oh, I've been inclined ¶¶

321
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:51,666
¶¶ To believe it never would ¶¶

322
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,867
¶¶ Oh, no, no ¶¶¶¶

323
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,845
<i>- Puckerman!
- Yeah!</i>

324
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:15,526
Huh! You know, I really think this is working.
I think we look super cool.

325
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,461
I'm proud of you, Finn. I'm proud of us.

326
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,691
Yeah. There's nothing
wrong with wanting to be popular.

327
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,894
It just means you want people to like you.
I think that's healthy.

328
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:27,564
- I totally agree.
- Being popular just means you can have it all.

329
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:31,708
- Oh, hey, guys.
- You thirsty?

330
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,041
Sure. Thanks.

331
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,080
- You can't do this!
- Oh, you think that's bad?

332
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,988
Just imagine what's gonna happen if you
don't show up to practice on Thursday...

333
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,992
and quit that little Glee Club for good!

334
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,552
Bros before hi-hos, dude. Don't forget that.

335
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:02,601
I hear people say,
"That's not how I define marriage."

336
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:05,939
Well, to them I say, "Love knows no bounds."

337
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,138
Why can't people marry dogs?

338
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,773
I'm certainly not advocating
intimacy with your pets.

339
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,682
I, for one, think intimacy
has no place in a marriage.

340
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:17,654
Walked in on my parents once,
and it was like seeing two walruses wrestling.

341
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:20,624
So "woof" on Prop 15, Ohio.

342
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:23,286
And that's how Sue sees it.

343
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:26,422
- Oh, Rod.
- Boffo, Sue.

344
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:30,025
And we'll be right back after this.

345
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:36,203
You still smell like scotch, Rod.

346
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:42,143
You know, Sue, there's a lot of pressure
being a local celebrity.

347
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:46,116
Most women find me intimidating.
The teeth, the hair...

348
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,278
It's a lot to take in, and I know it.

349
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,948
I need a gal with a little backbone.

350
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,720
And I think you just might be that gal.

351
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,261
Don't you have a wife, Rod?

352
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,623
She drowned.

353
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,327
So now I've got the condo all to myself.

354
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:07,839
Maybe we could go out sometime,
have a little fondue.

355
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:11,701
Sure. Okay.

356
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,507
Bread, cheese... Oh, fantastic.

357
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,571
I'll call you.

358
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,405
Sue... Whoo! That was amazing.

359
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,745
Oh! You know, I have to admit...

360
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:28,650
At first when you suggested
that I teach you a few steps...

361
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,654
I was hesitant.

362
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:33,520
You know, 'cause how horrible
you were to me and the Glee kids...

363
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,186
when Figgins made you co director.

364
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,422
Well, live and let learn, my friend.

365
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,522
That is ultimately what I got to.

366
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,762
It's nice not being at each other's throats.

367
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:45,894
You know, you're right. I...

368
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,940
Oh, gosh. I don't know how else to say this,
but I'm in love.

369
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:53,774
- Really?
- After one date, Sue Sylvester is in love.

370
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:56,279
E-9.

371
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:02,148
You sunk my battleship, Rod,
and you sunk it hard.

372
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:08,588
You know, Sue, I like to swing.

373
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,762
I could be good with that.

374
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:17,268
Rod has invited me to the Second Annual Allen
County Sickle-cell Anemia Dance-a-thon.

375
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,100
<i>- Ooh.
- And with your tutelage, Will...</i>

376
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,869
we can take home that blue ribbon like
two prize heifers in love.

377
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:26,809
I was wondering why you asked for dance lessons.

378
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:28,539
Oh, well, Erma just raved about you.

379
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:30,877
Sue, I'm... I'm actually touched.

380
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,645
I mean, you seem so happy and... nice.

381
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:38,156
And you've been so cool with Quinn Fabray
and her, you know, situation.

382
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:40,191
Mmm, yeah, well, she's just a confused kid...

383
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,783
and the least I can offer her
is my compassion.

384
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,329
<i>But, you, mister...</i>

385
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:48,366
- Aw...
- The Sue Sylvester who has been obsessed...

386
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:52,460
with sabotaging your every move is
now just a distant memory.

387
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:56,303
- That's great, Sue.
- Now all I feel for you is sympathy.

388
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,309
Whether it be for your sham of a marriage...

389
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:02,438
or the fact that Coach Tanaka's finally laying
down the law with regard to Glee Club.

390
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,675
Wait. What?

391
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,878
Yeah. Tanaka-san's making the kids choose.

392
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:11,389
Come on. Let's be honest.
What kid's gonna choose Glee Club over football?

393
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:14,323
It'd be ridiculous.

394
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:18,487
Hey, Ken, you wanna tell me
what the hell's goin' on?

395
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,895
You know I had a standing
Glee rehearsal on Thursday.

396
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:23,526
We sat down and worked out a schedule
when some of your guys joined the club.

397
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:26,264
Circumstances have changed.

398
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:29,865
I have a serious morale issue with my team.
It's my responsibility to fix it.

399
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:32,375
Sorry if me doing my job
interferes with your club.

400
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,969
Ken, we've known each other for years.

401
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:38,277
Your commitment to football
is about as long as your pants.

402
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,842
You know, let's get into
what this is really about.

403
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,356
You're upset that I don't like
your song for your wedding mash-up.

404
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,358
And you're right.
It's not my place to have an opinion.

405
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,360
Why don't you just cut the crap, Will?

406
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:54,525
You're not that naive.
This is not about a song. It's about my fiancée.

407
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,625
You and I, the whole world, knows
that I'm just a consolation prize to you.

408
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:59,636
How do you think that makes me feel?

409
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:01,296
Emma's totally into you.

410
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,534
Emma is settling for me.

411
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,202
And I love her so much, I don't care.

412
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,111
But it doesn't mean I appreciate
you comin' in with your Gene Kelly charm...

413
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:11,172
and gettin' high off of her fawning over you.

414
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:16,012
I-I have never intentionally encouraged Emma.

415
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:20,949
But I haven't discouraged her either.

416
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,995
You don't have to worry about it anymore though.

417
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,494
So, are we cool?

418
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:35,233
And I'll have my guys
on Thursday again? 3:30?

419
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,572
So you keep your rehearsal.
I'll keep my practice.

420
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,373
We'll let the kids decide
who's first choice...

421
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:44,438
and who's a consolation prize.

422
00:24:56,161 --> 00:25:00,928
...making Tommy Tune the first
to win Tony gold in four categories.

423
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,092
Totally interesting.

424
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,898
You know, you never told me
what you thought of my mash-up solo.

425
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:09,737
You're still missing the elusive high "B."
That's a brass ring for a baritenor.

426
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:12,470
I had to work on it for weeks
with Finn before he got it.

427
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,173
You're a great performer, Noah.

428
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:20,685
I just wanna say how proud I am to have you
on my arm in front of the whole high school.

429
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,295
You're pretty good at this.

430
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,764
I've had a lot of practice.

431
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:38,234
You're actually a lot luckier than me and Quinn.
Your head is shaved.

432
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:42,673
I'm really sorry I ever did this to you.

433
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:44,834
It's okay.

434
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,004
No, it isn't. No one deserves this feeling.

435
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:51,947
You know what the worst part is?
It's not the burning in your eyes...

436
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:55,180
or the way the Slushee drips
all the way into your underpants.

437
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:57,517
It's the humiliation.

438
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:00,114
I feel like I could
burst into tears at any moment.

439
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:02,455
Rachel...

440
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:05,985
I'm sorry, but today
when the clock chimes 3:30...

441
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:11,859
You're choosing football over Glee, which means
we probably can't be together anymore.

442
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:15,532
Yes. Damn,
I feel like such a bad Jew.

443
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:30,483
Are you ready yet?
We've only got an hour for lunch, Emma.

444
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:32,887
<i>It's not like trying on a pair of jeans, Will.</i>

445
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:36,758
<i>Well, it doesn't have to be perfect.
We just have to see if you can dance in it.</i>

446
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,565
Fits okay?

447
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:54,068
Yeah. Fits great.

448
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:56,306
Terrific.

449
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:09,217
Yeah, terrific.

450
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:13,690
Uh, so, should we see if you can dance in it?

451
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,932
Okay.

452
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,937
This is the instrumental
version of your wedding song.

453
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:22,633
You can sing along if you want to.
It'll help your footwork.

454
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:45,925
¶¶ I could have danced all night ¶¶

455
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:49,763
<i>¶¶ I could have danced all night ¶¶</i>

456
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:55,136
¶¶ And still have begged for more ¶¶

457
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:58,698
¶¶ I could have spread my wings ¶¶

458
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,905
¶¶ And done a thousand things ¶¶

459
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:08,044
<i>¶¶ I've never done before ¶¶</i>

460
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:14,922
¶¶ I'll never know
what made it so exciting ¶¶

461
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:21,296
¶¶ Why all at once
my heart took flight ¶¶

462
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:26,565
¶¶ I only know when he ¶¶

463
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:30,335
¶¶ Began to dance with me ¶¶

464
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:35,471
¶¶ I could have danced
danced, danced ¶¶

465
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:39,881
¶¶ All night ¶¶¶¶

466
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:47,591
Yeah, you can dance in it.

467
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,758
So, I gotta get goin' . Um...

468
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:55,459
Got the big showdown today at 3:30. and, uh...

469
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:59,094
I wanna make sure I'm there to support
the kids, no matter what happens.

470
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:03,800
Wait, what showdown? I thought... I thought
you and Sue had that last week.

471
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:07,140
Eh... Between me and your fiancé.

472
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:10,375
Uh, Ken's told
all the football players in Glee...

473
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:13,349
that they have to choose
between the club and the team.

474
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,613
And unless all the guys choose Glee...

475
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:18,212
it looks like we won't
have enough members for sectionals.

476
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:21,816
- Then Glee is over.
- I know.

477
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,028
Well, wish me luck.

478
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:35,565
Hey, guys.

479
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:51,578
I guess they're not coming.
I'm really sorry, guys.

480
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:54,022
I can't believe this.
I thought they were our friends.

481
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:56,026
How can they just abandon us?

482
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:09,501
Hi. I'm glad you made it.

483
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,701
<i>You scared me.</i>

484
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:15,941
<i>Good to see you, huh?</i>

485
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:28,515
Are you... sure about this, Noah?

486
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:32,427
I mean, choosing us over the team means
you might get a Slushee in your face every day.

487
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,062
Bring it.

488
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:42,705
<i>Where's Finn?</i>

489
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:50,010
- Hey, fella.
- Hey, man.

490
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:52,242
- You made the right decision.
- What's up, dude?

491
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,221
Okay, let's huddle up.

492
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:24,003
Do it.

493
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:26,016
I really don't want to, honestly.

494
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,416
I know how picky you are about
what products you use on your face.

495
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:32,422
But you've been getting so much pressure
from the gorillas on the football team.

496
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,617
I guess they didn't appreciate me resigning
from the team and choosing Glee.

497
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:37,752
Probably would have went over better
if you didn't announce it in the showers.

498
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,797
You are not gonna Slushee on my man Kurt.

499
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:41,923
Why wouldn't he? He's made his choice.

500
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,491
<i>He doesn't care about us losers anymore.</i>

501
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,469
No, that's not true.
It's just that if I don't do it...

502
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:48,471
the guys on the team are gonna
kick the crap out of me.

503
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,133
Well, we can't have that, can we?

504
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:54,770
- What are you doin' ?
- It's called taking one for the team.

505
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:09,157
Now get out of here.
And take some time to think whether or not...

506
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:12,060
any of your friends on the football team
would have done that for you.

507
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:20,567
Someone get me to a day-spa stat!

508
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:39,219
- Ooh, hey, hey, hey.
- Oh. Sue.

509
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,987
Rod. Andrea.

510
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:48,192
Uh, you aren't scheduled to tape another
"Sue's Corner" until... tomorrow night.

511
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:52,066
I came by special to show you my zoot suit.

512
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,434
I had it made for our dance competition.

513
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:58,373
But, uh, only the men wear those.

514
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:01,503
- Further embarrassed.
- You're taking her?

515
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:04,514
<i>- Not now, Andrea.
- He took me last year.</i>

516
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:07,107
We came in third.

517
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:12,384
You didn't think that...
we were... exclusive, did you?

518
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:15,018
It's the only way I do it, Rod.

519
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:20,360
I can't be caged in, Sue.
That's why I got my tiger tattoo.

520
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:22,763
<i>Heck, even my wife understood that.</i>

521
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:28,238
Are we still on for Saturday night?

522
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:30,570
No.

523
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,914
Hut!

524
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:53,521
- You miss it?
- Hell, no.

525
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:59,996
<i>Set, hut!</i>

526
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:02,437
I hope you didn't choose
Glee over football because of me.

527
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,304
Why?

528
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,969
Because I don't think
this relationship is gonna work out.

529
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:11,138
It's cool.
I was gonna break up with you anyway.

530
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,108
- No, you weren't.
- Yes, I was.

531
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:17,814
You won't even let me touch your boobs.

532
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,758
It's Finn, right?

533
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:26,195
<i>He's never gonna leave Quinn.
Not with that baby in her belly.</i>

534
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:30,701
You like her, don't you? I can see you
staring at her when I'm staring at Finn.

535
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:35,364
Is that why you joined Glee?
To be closer to her?

536
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:40,270
Like I said, they're never breaking up.

537
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:42,437
God, what's the matter with me?

538
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:45,004
I'm a stud, and I can't even
hold on to a chick like you?

539
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,541
No offense. Why don't girls like me?

540
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:51,520
Because you're kind of a jerk.
No offense.

541
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:55,287
I just think you want it too much...

542
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,226
<i>which is something I can relate to.</i>

543
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:00,059
I want everything too much.

544
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,899
Our relationship was built on a fantasy.

545
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:09,302
Like every other one in my life.

546
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:14,333
I think I just agreed to us being together
because I thought it would make Finn jealous.

547
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,578
- I just hope we can still be friends.
- We weren't friends before.

548
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:30,160
Hey, Finn, wanna have a catch?

549
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:32,696
- Sure.
- Go long.

550
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,070
I'm not comin' back.

551
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:46,267
These are the moments, Finn.
They're the crossroads.

552
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:49,177
They're the ones you look back
at when you get old and think "what if?"

553
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:54,182
I don't buy that.
I don't think any one decision makes your life...

554
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:59,087
unless you accidentally invent
some kind of zombie virus or somethin' .

555
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,456
No. You're right.

556
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,961
Life's a series of choices.

557
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,557
Big combination of moments...
little ones that add up to big ones...

558
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:13,229
<i>that create who you are.</i>

559
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:17,566
You're lettin' other people
make those choices for you, Finn.

560
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:21,077
You're letting them decide
who you're gonna be.

561
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:23,272
People you're not even
gonna know in three years.

562
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,281
People whose names you're gonna forget...

563
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,044
when you run into them in the hardware store.

564
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:29,643
You don't understand
the kind of pressure I'm under.

565
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,654
Yes, I do.

566
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:35,715
Because of all the students I've ever had,
you remind me the most of me.

567
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:41,889
Come back to Glee, Finn.

568
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:44,025
It's where you belong.

569
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:00,951
Hey, Coach.
Can I talk to you about somethin' ?

570
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:04,146
- You got an itch down there or somethin' ?
- What?

571
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,315
No. Uh...

572
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,257
- I'm the quarterback, right? The leader.
- Sure.

573
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:16,198
Well, all this stuff about having
to choose between Glee and football...

574
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:18,201
is making it hard for me to lead.

575
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:24,700
Leaders are supposed to see things
that other guys don't.

576
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:27,972
Right? Like they can imagine
a future where things are better.

577
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:30,343
<i>Like Thomas Jefferson or that kid from
the Terminator movies.</i>

578
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:40,447
I see a future where
it's cool to be in Glee Club.

579
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:45,223
Where you can play football and sing and dance
and no one gets down on you for it.

580
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:48,460
Where the more different you are the better.

581
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:56,931
I guess what I'm tryin' to say is...

582
00:37:57,008 --> 00:38:00,034
I don't wanna have to choose
between them anymore.

583
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:04,476
It's not cool.

584
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:20,320
Hey, about that Thursday practice.
It's, uh, canceled indefinitely.

585
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,832
<i>I got... stuff I gotta do that time.</i>

586
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,164
Laundry, things like that.

587
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:28,865
Oh. Sweet.

588
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:32,200
Finn.

589
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:36,508
Tell Puckerman and the other guys too,
will you?

590
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,107
Sure. Thanks, Coach.

591
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:45,114
<i>Schuester!</i>

592
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:48,522
- Yeah.
- I'll need to see that set list
for sectionals after all.

593
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:51,652
I want it on my desk warm
from the laminator at 5:00 p.m.

594
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:56,029
And if it is one minute late, I will go to
the animal shelter and get you a kitty cat.

595
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,466
I will let you fall in love
with that kitty cat.

596
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:02,370
And then on some dark,
cold night I will steal a way into your home...

597
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,704
and punch you in the face.

598
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,212
- Hey, Sue.
- What?

599
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,373
- Didn't work out with Rod?
- No, it did not.

600
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,680
Q. take off those sunglasses.

601
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:18,381
I wanna look in your eyes
when I give you this piece of business.

602
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:21,857
You're off the Cheerios.
I can't have a pregnant girl on my squad.

603
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:24,258
You're a disgrace.

604
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,242
Hey.

605
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:42,176
Hey.

606
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:47,582
I wanted to talk to you
about your wedding mash-up.

607
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:51,617
I've been workin' really hard on it and...

608
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:56,449
I just can't get
those two songs to go together.

609
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,791
Yeah. That's because they don't.

610
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:02,625
We both know that.

611
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:08,596
They're both good songs though.

612
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:12,842
Great ones.

613
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:20,679
Will, um, I just wanted to say, uh...

614
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,945
Thank you...

615
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:26,956
for the dance lessons.

616
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:45,306
So, what do you think about
my welcome back gift to the club, huh, guys?

617
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:48,872
Thanks for the Slushees, Finn.
They're delicious.

618
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:52,006
<i>And loaded with empty calories.
You know why they call them Slushees?</i>

619
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:53,913
Because your butt looks like one
if you have too many of them.

620
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:57,715
I'd like to propose a toast. To Mr. Schue.

621
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,154
You were right about Glee Club and football
bein' a killer combination.

622
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:08,064
Mr. Schue, I am sorry to report...

623
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,999
that we've all been remiss
about completing our assignment this week.

624
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:14,265
Yeah, none of us could
find a good groove for "Bust a Move."

625
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:16,272
And I personally feel like a failure.

626
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,707
Well, that's okay, guys.
Because I feel like the lesson landed.

627
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:21,677
And that's what's important.

628
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:26,876
And we are glad to have you back, Finn.

629
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:30,682
- You okay, Quinn?
- Do I look okay?

630
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:36,021
<i>I'm devastated. Now that I'm off the Cheerios,
I'll start every day with a Slushee facial.</i>

631
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:40,086
That's okay if that happens, Quinn, because
there are 11 of your friends right here...

632
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:43,361
<i>who are gonna be more than
happy to help clean you off.
- Yeah. Whoo!</i>

633
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,026
That's right, girl.

634
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,598
Mmm, brain freeze.

635
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:54,268
I can't imagine gettin'
hit in the kisser with one of these.

636
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:58,574
You've never been hit
by a Slushee before, Mr. Schue?

637
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,207
Um...

638
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:04,376
All right, guys.

639
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,123
We're a team.

640
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,557
Bring it on. Gimme your best shot.

641
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:15,793
One, two, three.

642
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:23,429
Oh.
All right. From the top.
