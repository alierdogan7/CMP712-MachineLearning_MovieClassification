- Hello, Miss Penny.
- Is my daddy here?

15
00:01:27,745 --> 00:01:30,213
Penny, come here, please.

16
00:01:30,314 --> 00:01:33,875
Penny, I have some
sad news for you.

17
00:01:33,984 --> 00:01:36,145
But you'll be a brave
little girl, won't you?

18
00:01:36,253 --> 00:01:39,347
- Is it about my daddy?
- Yes, Penny.

19
00:01:39,457 --> 00:01:43,518
- Has anything happened to him?
- No. No, dear, no.

20
00:01:43,627 --> 00:01:47,495
But he's sent for you.
You're going to leave us.

21
00:01:47,598 --> 00:01:52,058
<i>- Are you gonna take me right now, Gus?
Right this minute?
- Yes, Miss Penny.</i>

22
00:01:52,169 --> 00:01:54,899
- I'm gonna live with my daddy at the Riverview?
- Yes, Miss Penny.

23
00:01:55,005 --> 00:01:57,064
On and on, for keeps?

24
00:01:57,174 --> 00:01:59,472
- Yes, Miss Penny.
- Oh, Gus!

25
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:02,808
Maybe I'd better
wait outside.

26
00:02:02,913 --> 00:02:05,848
It's very sad news, Miss Vincent,
but I wanna be brave...

27
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,885
even though I am
gonna miss everybody so much.

28
00:02:08,986 --> 00:02:11,511
- And now I'd better pack. Don't you think?
- Oh, yes.

29
00:02:11,622 --> 00:02:14,386
- It's not polite to keep people waiting.
- No, dear.

30
00:02:14,492 --> 00:02:16,653
Please, may I be excused?

31
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,522
I feel awful sad about
leaving you, Miss Vincent.

32
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:22,690
- Good-bye! [Laughs]
- Good-bye.

33

<i>- Good-bye, Miss Burns.

34
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:29,428
I wonder why Mr. Hale is taking her
out of school so suddenly.

35
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,940
They're going abroad,
no doubt.

36
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:35,409
It wouldn't be finances.
His last check is overdue.

37
00:02:35,513 --> 00:02:37,674
Finances? Hardly--

38
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:39,976
with the Riverview
as an address?

39
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,099
- Why, Miss Penny.
- Hello, Corporal.

40
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:08,235
- Please don't stop me now.
I've gotta find my daddy.
- Wait a minute.

41
00:03:08,345 --> 00:03:10,711
Hey, Penny,
come back here!

42
00:03:10,814 --> 00:03:13,908
Fine doorman you are-- Lettin' her go
right through the door.

43
00:03:14,018 --> 00:03:16,213
What kind of a doorman
you call that?

44
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,221
Hello, Mr. Waters.
I'm back.

Did you not listen?

00:04:21,752 --> 00:04:24,152

00:04:27,491 --> 00:04:29,482
That proves
how stupid you are.

63
00:04:29,593 --> 00:04:32,460
- You don't live here and neither does she.
- Don't mind him.

64
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:36,055
He's all mixed up. I'm the one
who lives here-- My daddy and me.

65
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,828
I beg your pardon.
This is my uncle's apartment.

66
00:04:38,936 --> 00:04:43,464
I live here with my mother and my sister and
my Uncle Sam. Now, kindly vacate our premises.

67
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:46,475
Do you think I don't know where I live?
We've lived here three years.

68
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:49,512
Unless you want trouble with my daddy,
you'd better get out and--

<i>I'm more sorry than I can say. I'm deeply
embarrassed. Come along, Miss Hale, quickly.</i>

70
00:04:54,284 --> 00:04:56,684
- But why?
- Run along, little girl. Scat! Shoo!

71
00:04:56,787 --> 00:04:59,312
- Daddy!
- I'm taking you to your daddy right now.

72
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:01,482
- Where are you?
- This is very unfortunate. I apologize.

73
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:04,026
It will never happen again.
I assure you. I'm very sorry.

74
00:05:04,128 --> 00:05:06,153

- Daddy!

- Daddy!

76
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:12,098
Children are impossible
these days.

77
00:05:12,202 --> 00:05:14,830
They don't ask if they live
in your house, they just tell you.

78
00:05:14,938 --> 00:05:18,271
They walk right in and tell you.
You haven't a moment of privacy...

79
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,935
without some child coming in
to tell you she lives with you.

80
00:05:21,045 --> 00:05:23,377
Mother, I pointed out her
mistake to her emphatically--

81
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,007
- not only in English, but in French.
- In French? Bah!

82
00:05:27,184 --> 00:05:31,211
But why did Daddy move?
He liked our penthouse, and I loved it.

83

Oh, questions, questions.

Okay.

96
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:21,067
This is my new job
since I've seen you last.

97
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:25,164
I think it's a wonderful way to earn money--
just playing with dogs.

98
00:06:25,275 --> 00:06:28,301
Yeah, that's what I thought
when I took the job.

00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,614
I went up
to the penthouse.

110
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,048
A lot of funny people
live there now.

111
00:07:08,152 --> 00:07:10,552
No wonder you moved
down here.

112
00:07:10,654 --> 00:07:13,145
- Did Gus take you up there?
- Oh, no.

113
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:16,488
I just supposed--
I mean, I thought--

114
00:07:16,593 --> 00:07:18,788
Gus didn't take me.

115
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,956
Well, he's working for those people now
because we haven't any job for him.

116
00:07:22,065 --> 00:07:25,728
- I... sold our car.
- Oh.

117
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:30,330
Well, then, you and I are gonna have
a lot of nice walks together, aren't we?

118
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,965
Oh, sure.
Do you remember--

119
00:07:33,076 --> 00:07:36,341
Do you remember how hard I used to
work before you went away to school?

120
00:07:36,446 --> 00:07:39,347
How I was always planning buildings
and putting them up?

121
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:41,508
We had hardly any time at all
to be together.

122
00:07:41,618 --> 00:07:43,586
And you were tired
all the time.

123
00:07:43,687 --> 00:07:46,520
Well, that wasn't so good,
was it?  But it made money.

124
00:07:46,623 --> 00:07:51,686
We had money to live in a penthouse
and have a car and Gus and all the others.

125
00:07:51,795 --> 00:07:54,320
But now it's awfully hard
to get jobs.

126
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:56,831
There seem to be enough buildings,
so I'm not working...

127
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,027
and we haven't so much
in our pocketbook.

128
00:07:59,136 --> 00:08:03,334
But you see what that means? It means
we have all that extra time to be together.

129
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,772
- That's a lot better, isn't it?
- Sure it is.

130
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:08,777
But there's one thing
I want to do.

131
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,905
There's one thing
I want to finish.

132
00:08:12,015 --> 00:08:15,849
That's the one building
your daddy wants to finish.

133
00:08:17,988 --> 00:08:20,252
- Why?
- I put all my money into it.

134
00:08:20,357 --> 00:08:23,724
A lot of other men did too,
because it took a great deal.

135
00:08:23,827 --> 00:08:29,231
Then we had bad times, and a banker
came along and took it away from us.

136
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,392
- What's a banker?
- [Chuckles]

137
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:34,436
Well, a banker--

138
00:08:34,538 --> 00:08:39,373
A banker is a sort of person that, uh--
that keeps things that belong to other people.

139
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:42,206
- You mean a burglar?
- [Chuckling] Oh, no.

140
00:08:42,312 --> 00:08:44,303
No, darling, not that.

141
00:08:44,414 --> 00:08:48,043
But we're not licked. And your daddy
is gonna make that banker understand...

142
00:08:48,151 --> 00:08:50,415
that he must let me
go through with the deal.

143
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,489
And then we can move upstairs,
and you can go back to school.

144
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,252
Who wants to go upstairs
and go back to school?

145
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,988
Not me.
I like it here.

146
00:08:59,096 --> 00:09:02,224
There aren't so many stairs to climb,
and the rooms are small.

147
00:09:02,332 --> 00:09:05,768
- I don't have to walk around so much.
- [Laughing]

148
00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:08,497
- Oh!
- My legs are so short...

149
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:12,132
it used to wear me out walking across
that big apartment.

150
00:09:12,242 --> 00:09:17,145
And it was so high, I used to get dizzy
looking down at all the people.

151
00:09:17,247 --> 00:09:19,511
- Remember?
- Uh-huh.

152
00:09:19,616 --> 00:09:22,949
Now it's different.
I can look up.

153
00:09:23,053 --> 00:09:26,511
It'll be fun guessing what kind
of people go with all those feet.

154
00:09:26,623 --> 00:09:32,357
And besides, it's about time
somebody looked after you.

155
00:09:32,462 --> 00:09:37,092

- Just to make conversation, what's your way?

- Get married.

do something.

- What about my pride?

Don't you, Uncle Sam?

The less hair you have,

Then he won't call you

I can't imagine anything any sillier
than trying to please Uncle Sam.

- My, that works beautifully.

530
00:32:26,835 --> 00:32:29,201
- Do you have to cut 'em all off?
- Certainly.

531
00:32:29,305 --> 00:32:31,569
How can you fill
Uncle Sam's shoes someday...

532
00:32:31,674 --> 00:32:34,734

and have curls?

533

- No.

Now you'll only get a general idea.

But, of course,

But it does.
In fact...

00:33:09,011 --> 00:33:12,447
that's the only reason why
why I agreed to in the first place.

it's all right with me.

555
00:33:51,253 --> 00:33:54,154
Giving in to somebody

Mm-hmm. Just wait

641
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:01,087
By the way, how is he?

642
00:40:01,189 --> 00:40:05,523
When he's with me, he'she's fine,
but I don't think he's so cheerful inside.

643
00:40:05,627 --> 00:40:09,927
Well, maybe you just imagine that.
Or do you think he has something on his mind?

644
00:40:10,031 --> 00:40:15,128
- I think he's worried.
- Probably because he hasn't any buildings to build.

645
00:40:15,237 --> 00:40:20,300
- I think he's worried about you.
- Oh, Penny, you're just guessing.

646
00:40:20,408 --> 00:40:25,107
- What makes you think so?
- Because he's always asking me
questions about you.

647
00:40:25,213 --> 00:40:29,047
- Just like you're asking me questions about him.
- Oh, Penny!

648
00:40:30,252 --> 00:40:33,653
Goodness, you must
feel better.

649
00:40:33,755 --> 00:40:36,622
Excuse me.
I've got to find Milton.

650
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,750
<i>- [ Knocks]
- Come in.</i>

651
00:40:43,165 --> 00:40:47,261
- What's wrong up here?
- You're wanted on the terrace.
There's a short circuit.

652
00:40:50,939 --> 00:40:54,340
- What's a short circuit?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

653
00:40:54,442 --> 00:40:56,740
[Laughing]

654
00:41:14,796 --> 00:41:17,492
- Good evening.
- Jeff.

655
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,432
Now, what are you doing here?

656
00:41:20,535 --> 00:41:23,197
<i>- You oughta know. You sent for me.
- I sent for you?</i>

657
00:41:23,305 --> 00:41:27,173
- Well, that's pretty thin.
- Sure, it is. It'd be better if I'd made it up myself.

658
00:41:27,275 --> 00:41:32,611
- I wouldn't have come near
if someone hadn't called me.
- Well, before I'd call you, I'd--

659
00:41:32,714 --> 00:41:37,549
I didn't call you, Jeff,
but I'm awfully glad you're here.

660
00:41:37,652 --> 00:41:40,746
- Then there's nothing wrong?
- Nothing that a little common sense won't heal.

661
00:41:40,856 --> 00:41:46,522
- [Laughing]
- Excruciating, Mr. Waters. Excruciating!
Milton, where's Lola?

662
00:41:46,628 --> 00:41:48,858
<i>- Why, she's--
- Lola. Lola.</i>

663
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:51,626
<i>Lola. Lola.</i>

664
00:41:51,733 --> 00:41:54,759
Yes, Mother?

665
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:58,636
Oh, she's out in the night air again,
and it isn't good for her.

666
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:03,575
But then what kind of air can you get at night
but night air? [Laughs]

667
00:42:03,678 --> 00:42:07,205
[Both Laughing]

668
00:42:07,315 --> 00:42:10,045
<i>- [Mrs. Ramsby] Oh, Lola.
- Oh, yes, Mother.</i>

669
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:15,786
- Mother, you know Mr. Hale.
- Whatever is he dressed like that for?

670
00:42:15,891 --> 00:42:18,758
He he just came from
a masquerade.

671
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:23,797
Oh. Oh, I love masquerades. I went once
as a New England boiled dinner.

672
00:42:23,899 --> 00:42:27,926
- Mother, Penny's Mr. Hale's little daughter.
- Oh. Oh.

673
00:42:28,036 --> 00:42:33,064
Oh, ho-ho. Oh, it's too amazing.
She's such a busy little thing, isn't she?

674
00:42:33,174 --> 00:42:37,270
When she cut off Milton's curls, I was
so upset that the doctor had to give me--

675
00:42:37,379 --> 00:42:39,574
<i>Uh, um, uh,
what was it, Lola?</i>

676
00:42:39,681 --> 00:42:42,445
- Shots, Mother.
- Oh, yes. Of course. Shots.

677
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:44,780
And don't they shoot you
in the oddest places. [Laughs]

678
00:42:44,886 --> 00:42:49,016
- Well, out of sight, out of mind,
don't you say, Mr. Gale?
- "Hale," Mother.

679
00:42:49,124 --> 00:42:54,152
Oh. Heh. Oh, yes, of course. Mr. Hale.
Just like "Hail Columbia." [Laughs]

680
00:42:54,262 --> 00:42:57,026
- Shall we all have something to drink?
Oh, yes, of course.
- Oh, yes.

681
00:42:57,132 --> 00:42:59,464
Lola, you ring for it.
Oh, no, my dear. No.

682
00:42:59,567 --> 00:43:04,595
No. You stay here and talk to Mr. Waters
and Mr. "Pale." I'll do it myself.

683
00:43:04,706 --> 00:43:06,936
- Shall we?
- Yes, indeed. [Chuckles]

684
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:10,603
- You know, I, uh--
- Don't go, Mr. Waters. Stay and play with us.

685
00:43:10,712 --> 00:43:13,203
- [Penny] Yes, Mr. Waters.
We have a new game for you.
- [Protesting]

686
00:43:13,315 --> 00:43:15,306
- Now listen. I-- Now please.
- Come on.

687
00:43:15,417 --> 00:43:18,147
- This is absolutely absurd.
- Oh, now, just come on.
- Sit.

688
00:43:18,253 --> 00:43:21,484
Have you ever played blindman's bluff?
You'll love it. It's a wonderful game.

689
00:43:21,589 --> 00:43:24,023
- Oh, blindman's bluff.
- Now come on.

690
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:26,491
- Can you see?
- Can I see? Well, of course I can't see.

691
00:43:26,594 --> 00:43:30,030
- No peeking now.
- Now the object of the game is to find Lola.
We'll start you off.

692
00:43:30,131 --> 00:43:32,725
Oh. To find Lola.
Well, it isn't so silly after all, if l--

693
00:43:32,834 --> 00:43:35,701
Now when we say "hot,"
it means you're close.

694
00:43:35,804 --> 00:43:39,137
And when we say "cold," you're far away.
Come on. Put your hands behind your back.

695
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,232
- Round you go. Come on. Whoo!
- Oh! [Chuckling] Oh, stop! [Laughing]

696
00:43:42,344 --> 00:43:44,335
- There you are.
- Oh, am I dizzy.

697
00:43:44,446 --> 00:43:46,414
- [Penny] All right. Come on, Mr. Waters.
- Am l--

698
00:43:47,615 --> 00:43:50,743
Oh. [Chuckles]
All right.

699
00:43:50,852 --> 00:43:54,720
- Aw, you're cold. You're cold. You're freezing.
- You're cold.

700
00:43:54,823 --> 00:43:58,088
- Am I really?
- Cold. You're gettin' warmer.

701
00:43:58,193 --> 00:44:02,994
[Kids] Warmer. Warmer.
You're hot! You're hot! You're hot!

- Oh, you're freezing. You're freezing.

Cold. Cold.

- Aw, you're colder. You're colder.
- Warmer? Oh, you're cold.

what's going on here? What's all this racket?

Well, you see--

00:45:14,235 --> 00:45:19,298

727
00:45:21,876 --> 00:45:25,744
Now see here. You've outshouted this family
for years, but you're not going to outshout me.

728
00:45:25,847 --> 00:45:29,283
- I love that man, and I'm going to marry him.
- Over my dead body you'll marry.

729
00:45:29,384 --> 00:45:32,945
- I'm going to marry him
if it's over everybody's dead body.
- You won't marry him!

730
00:45:33,054 --> 00:45:36,751
If you'd only listen to him about that
East Gate project, instead of being
a stupid old--

731

- old--old--
- Old, uh, what, my dear?

732
00:45:39,527 --> 00:45:42,758
Oh, I'm sorry, Uncle Sam.
Really I am. But I'm not giving in.

Uncle Sam,
you don't mean it?

736
00:45:51,473 --> 00:45:54,670
You're going to, uh,
live in the basement, I suppose?

737
00:45:54,776 --> 00:45:58,678
We won't have to live in the basement
if you'll listen to Jeff. He has so much to offer.

738
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:01,647
All he needs is to have someone
cooperate instead of fighting him.

739
00:46:01,749 --> 00:46:03,808

do something for him.

Yeah. Hello.
Henshaw speaking.

744
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:25,369
A little matter you can
attend to for me, Black.

745
00:46:26,508 --> 00:46:28,499
Yeah.

746
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:32,512
The pipeline we propose to lay in Dutch Borneo
will run from here to here.

747
00:46:32,614 --> 00:46:34,582
What is the terrain like,
Mr. Black?

748
00:46:34,682 --> 00:46:37,879
Well, there's a range of mountains here,
and then swamp and jungle.

749
00:46:37,986 --> 00:46:39,977
- Tough going?
- Very tough.

750
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:42,579
That's why we need a good man
to superintend the job.

751
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:46,182
- How did you happen to pick me?
- You were highly recommended
by a friend of mine.

752
00:46:46,294 --> 00:46:48,660
- Uh, cigarette?
- Thank you, no.

753
00:46:48,763 --> 00:46:53,200
After all, the man who carried on
with the East Gate project against the
odds that you did--

754
00:46:53,301 --> 00:46:55,997
- It's too bad you couldn't go through with it.
- I will someday.

755
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:58,504
Mmm. I'm sure of it.

756
00:46:58,606 --> 00:47:02,406
In the meantime, here's a job that needs
doing right now and will pay well.

757
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:05,274
- I could surely use it.
- Eh, you're not married, are you?

758
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:07,780
- No, not yet.
- That's good.

759
00:47:07,882 --> 00:47:11,682
We don't send family men out in that country.
You'll have to leave right away.

760
00:47:11,786 --> 00:47:14,277
How long should the job take?

761
00:47:14,389 --> 00:47:17,017
You'd have to sign up
for two years.

762
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:25,426
Borneo.

763
00:47:25,533 --> 00:47:30,061
Jeff, you can't go. You simply can't go to the end
of the world and leave us here.

764
00:47:30,171 --> 00:47:33,038
Do you think for a moment
I want to go?

765
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:35,109
Oh, it's a grand job,
a wonderful chance...

766
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:38,805
but if I had anything half as good here,
l-- I wouldn't even consider it.

767
00:47:38,913 --> 00:47:43,816
But you'll have something here if you wait.
Uncle promised to do something.

768
00:47:43,918 --> 00:47:49,413
I don't want that sort of job.
I told you before.

769
00:47:49,524 --> 00:47:52,891
- Jeff, I'm going with you.
- Now, that's the spirit.

770
00:47:52,994 --> 00:47:56,327
You can't go, but--
but just the same, that's the spirit.

771
00:47:56,431 --> 00:48:00,265
You see, they--they won't
take a married man on the job.

772
00:48:00,368 --> 00:48:04,099
Oh, but, Jeff, think how long it is,
how desperately long.

773
00:48:04,205 --> 00:48:07,231
Two whole years to wait.

774
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:10,402
I know.
I wanted to tell you.

775
00:48:10,511 --> 00:48:14,470
I'm not asking you
to wait for me, Lola. It's not fair.

776
00:48:14,582 --> 00:48:16,948
Now, look here,
Jeff Hale.

777
00:48:17,051 --> 00:48:22,489
- I can't stop you from going, but you just
try to stop me from waiting for you.
- Mmm.

778
00:48:25,426 --> 00:48:27,485

Uh, Borneo?
[Clears Throat] Borneo?

781
00:48:34,435 --> 00:48:36,596
Oh. Uh, he's moved up
into Harlem.

782
00:48:36,704 --> 00:48:40,504
Borneo isn't a man.
It's a place. Where is it?

783
00:48:40,608 --> 00:48:43,634
Borneo-- Oh, sure.

784
00:48:43,745 --> 00:48:47,681
That's where that big light
come from in the sky... nights.

785
00:48:47,782 --> 00:48:52,719
- What light?
- The aurora, uh, "borenalis."

786
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:55,448
- Everybody's heard of that.
- I haven't.

787
00:48:55,556 --> 00:48:59,515
Well, it's sorta north--
way up north near the North Pole.

788
00:48:59,627 --> 00:49:03,654
- That's where Borneo is.

789
00:49:03,765 --> 00:49:06,632
Yes, ma'am.

790
00:49:06,734 --> 00:49:10,864
Just stick your little nose outside of the door,
and you'll freeze to death.

791
00:49:10,972 --> 00:49:14,203
And if the "polo" bears
don't eat you, the Eskimos do.

792
00:49:14,309 --> 00:49:17,107
Oh.

793
00:49:24,485 --> 00:49:26,749
- Gus.
- Yeah?

794
00:49:26,854 --> 00:49:29,823
Gus, this is important.
I want a man's angle on it.

795
00:49:29,924 --> 00:49:31,892
- On what?
- Borneo.

796
00:49:31,993 --> 00:49:34,587
Bo-- Now, listen, beautiful.
I'm in a hurry.

797
00:49:34,696 --> 00:49:37,688
So am I.
I've only got a few days.

798
00:49:37,799 --> 00:49:40,267
- Where's Borneo?
- B-- Uh--

799
00:49:40,368 --> 00:49:42,928
It's, um--
It's near Gibraltar.

800
00:49:43,037 --> 00:49:47,838
- Where's Gibraltar?
- Well, I just told ya. It's, uhIt's near Borneo.

801
00:49:47,942 --> 00:49:51,036
Didn't you ever hear
of  The Wild Man of Borneo?
That's it.

802
00:49:51,145 --> 00:49:55,946
Wild men, lions, tigers,
swamps, fevers, uh--

803
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:59,076
Well, I gotta get to work.

804
00:49:59,187 --> 00:50:03,715
- The Corporal said it was
full of icebergs and polar bears.
- Aw, that's in winter.

805
00:50:03,825 --> 00:50:08,592
If anyone had lived there for two years,
could they ever come back alive?

806
00:50:08,696 --> 00:50:11,631
Not a chance.

807
00:50:11,733 --> 00:50:17,365
Now, you stay right here in little old
New York and let Borneo take care of itself.

808
00:50:23,411 --> 00:50:27,643
But please, you'll do everything
you can think of, won't you?

809
00:50:27,749 --> 00:50:31,116
I--I mean, if one thing doesn't work,
you won't stop.

810
00:50:31,219 --> 00:50:33,380
- You'll go right on.
- Count on me, darling.

811
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:36,480
I want him to stay here
just as much as you do.

812
00:50:36,591 --> 00:50:39,992
Not quite as much,
because, after all...

813
00:50:40,094 --> 00:50:43,495
you've got Milton and--
and all, and I'll be alone.

814
00:50:43,598 --> 00:50:46,499
But, Miss Lola...

815
00:50:46,601 --> 00:50:51,163
even if he says no a hundred
thousand times, you just insist.

816
00:50:51,272 --> 00:50:56,175
If you insist long enough
with my daddy, he always gives in...

817
00:50:56,277 --> 00:50:58,336
sometimes.

818
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:15,256
Hey, what are you doing
with those shirts?

819
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:20,665
I have to look them over. You can't go
to Borneo without buttons on your shirts.

820
00:51:28,643 --> 00:51:31,771
My socks.
But you've looked them over.

821
00:51:31,879 --> 00:51:35,144
Oh, sure, once,
but I have to double-check.

822
00:51:35,249 --> 00:51:37,945
I wouldn't think of letting you go
without double-checking.

823
00:51:38,052 --> 00:51:40,213
That's the second time
you've rated those socks.

824
00:51:40,321 --> 00:51:42,721
Aren't they
double-checked enough?

825
00:51:42,824 --> 00:51:46,851
Well, after all these are socks.
You can't check them too much.

826
00:51:46,961 --> 00:51:49,486
You might find a hole
in a sock anytime...

827
00:51:49,597 --> 00:51:51,895
and then what would
those "Borneonians" say?

828
00:51:51,999 --> 00:51:57,403
They'd say, "Now, what kind of a woman
is taking care of this poor man?"

829
00:51:57,505 --> 00:52:01,635
There! Just look at that.
And this is a triple-check.

[Chuckles Quietly]

831
00:52:03,811 --> 00:52:07,645
What you would do a way off in Borneo
without me to look after you...

832
00:52:07,748 --> 00:52:09,716
I hardly can imagine.

833
00:52:09,817 --> 00:52:12,081
I don't think I'll pack
any more today.

834
00:52:12,186 --> 00:52:15,519
After all, there's no hurry.
We still have two more full days.

835
00:52:15,623 --> 00:52:18,148
- And you might not go.
- What's that?

836
00:52:18,259 --> 00:52:20,591
Anything can happen
in two days.

837
00:52:20,695 --> 00:52:25,189
What if somebody did something for Uncle Sam,
and Uncle Sam did something for business?

838
00:52:25,299 --> 00:52:27,392
Then you wouldn't have to go
to Borneo, would you?

839
00:52:27,502 --> 00:52:29,527
No, I wouldn't
have to go, Penny.

840
00:52:29,637 --> 00:52:32,606
But don't you count on it, partner,
because it won't happen.
