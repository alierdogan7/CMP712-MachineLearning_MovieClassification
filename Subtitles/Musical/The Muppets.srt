[laughing]

3
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,959
[man] That's me, Walter.

4
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,838
Where... Where'd you go?
Oh, there you are!

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,753
[Walter] I have the best life
in the whole world.

6
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,635
[laughing]

7
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,870
[giggles] That's my brother, Gary.

8
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,508
He's the best friend
you could ever have.

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,512
Yeah, I know what you're thinking.

10
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,272
We could be twins.

11
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,115
Here's where we live : Smalltown...

12
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,275
...the best town
you could ever grow up in.

13
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,873
Gary and I did everything together.

14
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,029
[bell dings]

[chuckles]

17
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,037
And, as the years passed,
my brother was always there for me.

18
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,590
I got it! Gary, throw me! Throw me!

19
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,113
Aaah!

20
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,798
[Walter] We were a great team.

21
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,633
- Nice job, Walter.
- Thanks, Gary.

22
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,950
[grunting]

23
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,474
[Walter] Oh, don't get me wrong.
It's not perfect.

24
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,518
- That was so fun!
- [Walter] Nothing is.

25
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,749
[man] Sorry, kid.

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,229
- [girl] I wanna do that again!
- [man] Come on. I'll ride with ya!

27
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,628
[boy] Hurry up!

28
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,634
[Walter] Even the sunniest days
can have a few clouds in them.

29
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,596
Ride's bogus, anyway.
Hey, wanna rent a video?

30
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,354
[Walter] Yeah. Race you home!

31
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,593
And, well, that night
sorta changed everything.

32
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,712
It's The Muppet Show, with our very
special guest star, Mr. Steve Martin!

33
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,797
[Walter] I found them...

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,228
[gasps]

35
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,628
... The Muppets.

36
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,509
[inhales deeply]

37
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,672
I guess you could say
I was their number one fan.

38
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,317
[gasps] Oh, Gary, it's an entire map
of The Muppet Studios.

39
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,118
- [rattling]
- [chuckles]

40
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,032
[gasps]

41
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,077
And they made all the difference.

42
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,629
- [kids] Trick or treat!
- [Walter] Because from then on...

43
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,233
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hey, Gary.

44
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,115
- Hey.
- Hi-ho, guys. Yay!

45
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,595
[laughing]

46
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,514
[boy] Is that Kermit the Frog?
What is this, 1978?

47
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,114
[Walter]...even on the worst days,
I knew...

48
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,315
[sighs]

49
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,755
...that as the years passed...

50
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,558
[Kermit on TV] Cancel that last remark.

51
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,757
[Walter]...as long as there are singing
frogs and joking bears...

52
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,552
[both laughing]

53
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,469
...Swedish chefs and boomerang fish,

54
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,315
the world can't be such
a bad place after all.

55
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,359
All right, good night, buddy.

56
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,551
Oh, good night, Gary.

57
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,029
[Walter] And as long
as there are Muppets...

58
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,509
[yawns]

59
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,395
- ...for me...
- [man on TV]...hair-growing tonic.

60
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,437
...there's still...

61
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,034
- [snoring]
-...hope.

62
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,069
Aaah. Bye-bye!

63
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,152
- [laughing]
- [Kermit] Somebody get him!

64
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,548
Animal. Hey, Animal, come on.
The show's about to start.

65
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,790
Show! Show! [yells]

66
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,397
Hey, Walter, why don't you join us?

67
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,118
[man] Come on!

68
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,673
No! Wait! I want to be
with you guys! Please let me in!

69
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,400
Kermit!

70
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,228
[screaming, gasps]

71
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,953
Whoa!

72
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,348
Walter, are you OK, buddy?

73
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,159
You're drenched in sweat.
Did you have the dream again?

74
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,070
Ummm. No. Hey, so when are
you guys leaving today?

75
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,396
Oh, um, just a couple hours now.

76
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,111
Oh, wow, Gary, I think it is so cool
you're taking Mary to Los Angeles.

77
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,670
I can't believe you guys
have been dating for ten years.

78
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,274
I know. Yeah, she wanted to do
something special for this anniversary,

79
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,908
and she's always
wanted to see Los Angeles, so...

80
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,640
Hey, don't forget to send me a
postcard from The Muppet Studios.

81
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,673
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

82
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,594
- I can't do that, Walter.
- But, Gary...

83
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,830
Because... you're coming with us!

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,231
[gasps] Oh, Gary!

85
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,351
- But what about Mary?
- She's fine.

86
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,672
- She said the more the merrier.
- I... I don't know what to say!

87
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,991
The Muppet Studios are there, Gary.
I can't believe this!

88
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,634
Better get a move on.
We don't want to miss that bus!

89
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,588
No way! Who knows?
Maybe Kermit will be there.

90
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,512
I wouldn't get
your hopes up, buddy.

91
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,069
The Muppets haven't put
on a show together in years.

92
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,834
I don't think they use the studios
for anything but tours anymore.

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,434
Nah, I think that's
just an Internet rumor.

94
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,238
Like there's a country called Turkey.

95
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,913
Walter, how many times
do we have to go over this?

96
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,071
- Turkey is a very real country.
- Wow, Muppet Studios.

97
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,151
- I can't believe it!

All right, Carlos. Flip the ignition.

[engine starts]

a 12-volt starter.

- [bell ringing]
- Oh!

150
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,989
You know what that means.
Spring break.

[all groaning]

152
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,436
It's OK. We'll be back
to studying in two weeks.

153
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,433
Yay!

154
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,830
- Have a nice vacation.
- Bye. Have fun.

155
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,592
- Bye, Mr. Gary.
- Have a good break, guys.

156
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,829
- Hey, great job, Carlos.
- Thanks.

157
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,399
Enjoy your anniversary dinner.

158
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,676
- Hi.
- I got you these.

159
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,310
Oh. Sorry. It's probably from
the dance number I was doing.

160
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,471
It's OK. They're really sweet.

161
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,234
You excited for our big trip to LA?
I have our list.

162
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,233
Me, too. [chuckles]

163
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,152
Oh, this is the
most romantic thing ever.

164
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,550
I've always dreamt
of seeing Los Angeles.

165
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,159
I know. Walter can't wait either.

166
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,197
You don't mind that he's coming, right?

167
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,316
No. No, of course not.

168
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,677
As long as we can spend our anniversary
dinner together. That's all I ask.

169
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,470
Totally. It's gonna be the most
romantic anniversary dinner ever.

170
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,039
I love you so much.

171
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,875
Oh.

172
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,069
- I love you, too.
- I'm gonna go check on Walter.

173
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,392
[door opens]

174
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,435
# Everything's great
Everything's grand

175
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,512
# Except Gary's always off
with his friend

176
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,276
# It's never me and him
It's always me and him and him

177
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,556
# I wonder when it's going to end

178
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,958
# But I guess that's OK
'cause maybe someday

179
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,429
- # I know just how it's going to be
- [horse whinnies]

180
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,792
# He'll ride up on a steed
Get down on one knee

181
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:51,717
# And say "Mary, will you marry me?"

182
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,789
# Please #

183
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,788
Oh...

184
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,798
# I've got everything that I need

185
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,598
# Right in front of me

186
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,794
# Nothing's stoppin' me
Nothin' that I can't be

187
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,757
# With you right here next to me

188
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,596
# You've got everything that you need

189
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,675
# Right in front of you
Nothing's stopping you

190
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,833
# Nothing that you can't do
that the world can throw at you

191
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,149
# Life's a happy song

192
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,316
# When there's someone
by your side to sing

193

# Life's a happy song

# When there's someone

# Life's a happy song when there's

196
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,749
[bus honks]

197
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,159
- [man] OK, they're gone!
- [all groaning]

198
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,275
[Walter] Hey, Gary, what should
we do first at Muppet Studio?

199
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,398
'Cause I was thinking that maybe we
could start at Fozzie's Joke Room...

200
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,635
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait.

201
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,075
The lines might be shorter
at Honeydew's Laboratory of Fun,

202
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,074
so maybe we should start there instead.
I just... I just can't wait!

203
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,998
[breaks squealing]

204
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,077
[sirens blaring]

205
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,310
Oh, Walter, don't be nervous.

206
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,916
Oh, I know.
I just can't believe I'm here.

207
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,991
The home of the Muppets!

208
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,354
[speaking foreign language]

209
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,196
What... What happened to this place?

210
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,038
[sign creaking]

211
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,950
Where...?

212
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,079
- Where is everyone, Gary?
- I don't know, buddy. It's so...

213
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,073
OK, well, I guess you guys
are it for today.

214
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,994
[clears throat] Anyway, welcome
to the original Muppet Studio,

215
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,799
where dreams can come true.

216
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,110
[man speaking foreign language]

217
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,716
- Is this the Universal Studios?
- Yes, it is.

218
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,156
OK, now if you'll
just follow me, please.

219
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,957
OK. This used to be Kermit's office.

220
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,951
- Whoa.
- Mm-hmm.

221
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,838
It's really the highlight of the tour.

222
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,678
You should see it sometime.

223
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,230
OK, this next building
is where they kept the rope

224
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:48,315
and the medium-gauge wire for the
productions. Let's go take a look.

225
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,159
- Come on, buddy.
- [woman speaking foreign language]

226
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,471
Wow!

227
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,872
Oh, boy.

228
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,751
Oh.

229
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,552
Whoa.

230
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,119
- [doorknob rattling]
- [gasps]

231
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,990
There. Now this here is
Kermit the Frog's old office.

232
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,276
- Or so we've been "toad."
- [both laughing]

233
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,958
Well, as you know, gentlemen, I've loved
the Muppets since I was a boy.

234
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,876
And what better way
to honor the Muppets

235
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,033
than to make this beautiful
studio a Muppet museum.

236
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,635
[gasps]

237
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,518
I think I'll call this room

238
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,831
the "Kermit the Frog's
Old Office Room."

239
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,797
- Oh, that is lovely.
- Oh, good one, Mr. Richman.

240
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,873
Now, this here is the standard
"Rich and Famous" contract

241
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,640
Kermit signed 30 years ago,
that contains...

242
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,917
- The deed to this property.
- Exactly.

243
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,518
Now, this contract is 100 percent
ironclad, with one minor exception.

244
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,478
If the Muppets can raise the
ten million dollars it would cost

245
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,035
to buy the building before
this contract expires,

246
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,317
- then they get their studio back.
- You know, if I didn't know better,

247
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,318
I'd say you were reciting some
sort of an important plot point.

248
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,432
Well, I hope so. Otherwise,
I just bored the audience half to death.

249
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,591
You mean half the audience
is still alive?

250
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,239
[laughing]

251
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,714
It's nice doing business with you.

252
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,872
- Yes, sir. Come on.
- Goodbye.

253
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,996
I love geriatric humor.

254
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,591
Gentlemen, there's oil
under this studio.

255
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,873
- Yeah, I can smell it.
- [sniffing]

256
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,675
And more importantly, the geological
survey says there definitely is.

257
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,156
In two weeks, we tear
this place to the ground

258
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,551
and start drilling. Ah, those Muppets.

259
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,435
They think they're so funny.

260
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,633
Well, it looks like
the joke's about to be on them.

261
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,314
- Maniacal laugh.
- [laughs]

262
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,158
Maniacal laugh.

263
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,312
Maniacal laugh. Maniacal laugh.

264
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,955
- [gasps]
- Maniacal laugh.

265
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,272
[screaming]

266
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,192
- [Gary] Walter!
- [Mary] Walter?

267
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,588
- [Gary] Walter!
- [Mary] Walter!

268
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,272
[screaming continues]

269
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,236
[screaming continues]

270
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,673
Yeah, so then, when he thought
they were alone, he said,

271
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,115
[mocking] "There's oil
under this studio, see.

272
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,555
I'm gonna tear it to the ground, see.

273
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,996
- Sweet, sweet oil, see!"
- People still talk like that?

274
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,878
Maybe that's just how
he sounded in my head.

275
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,589
Either way, we've got to find Kermit!
He'll know what to do.

276
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,990
How do we find Kermit?
Nobody's seen him in years.

277
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,988
[Walter gasps] Stop the car!
I've got an idea!

278
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,158
[all] Mmm.

279
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,753
These are delicious!

280
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,717
- Great idea, Walter.
- Mm-hmm.

281
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,272
[Gary] We've been doing this
for a long time.

282
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,759
I think maybe we should
call it a night.

283
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,195
- [Mary] Guys!
- We can't give up, Gary.

284
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,158
But it's getting really late. Maybe
we should just go back to the motel.

285
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,117
- Guys!
- It...

286
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,474
- What?
- What?

287
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,350
- Maybe he lives there.
- Oh. That's it.

288
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,348
So, what do we do now?

289
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,599
I don't see a doorbell,
and the house looks empty.

290
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,512
- Gary, throw me over.
- What?

291
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,990
- Gary, just throw me over already!
- OK.

292
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,675
- OK, here we go. OK...
- One, two, three.

293
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,869
- [cracking]
- [grunts]

294
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,439
- That's good.
- Sorry.

295
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,919
- No, it's good.
- Guys?

296
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,116
I think that's an electric fence.

297
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,599
Mary, it's Kermit the Frog.

298
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,475
- OK, buddy, head down.
- [both] One, two, three!

299
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,952
[screaming]

300
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,716
- It's an electric fence.
- Yep.

301
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,669
Oh, my gosh. Walter? Walter, buddy?
Walter, can you hear me?

302
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,434
- [raspy] Throw me again.
- No, I don't...

303
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,556
I don't think that's a good idea.

304
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,154
- What kind of throw was that?
- I think there's somebody coming.

305
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,753
[man] Excuse me...

306
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,035
[choir vocalizing]

307
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,153
You OK? That was quite a tumble.

308
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,148
Oh. Look, look. I think...

309
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,276
Hey. Hey, Walter?

310
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,432
- Walter, you all right, buddy?
- Where am I?

311
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,270
OK, this is awesome.
We're at Kermit's house.

312
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,711
- Oh, jeez. Walter.
- No, no, no, no, no. You OK?

313
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,359
This... This is Kermit's house?

314
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,997
- Anyhow, how can I help you guys?
- [gasps]

315
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,919
Let me just say, this is an honor
for all of us to meet you, sir,

316
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,236
but my brother, Walter, has some
really disturbing news for you.

317
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,154
- Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
- Not now, 80's Robot.

318
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,834
Might I offer you a drink? Tab?

319
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,228
- [Kermit] Good grief.
- New Coke?

320
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,675
Listen. Not right now,
80's Robot, please!

321
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,438
Bummer.

322
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,919
- [Kermit] Watch out for the...
- Gag me with a spoon.

323
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,957
- [Kermit] Yeah, head for the door.
- Grody to the max.

324
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,759
- [banging]
- Ow.

325
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,553
Ow.

326
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,631
- I'm really sorry about that...
- [crashing]

327
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,949
...Walter. What were you saying?

328
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,669
- Yes. Tex Richman, the oil baron, is...
- Yes, yes, yes.

329
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,751
Oil baron Tex Richman,
the wealthy philanthropist.

330
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,229
You know, he's about to buy
our old Muppet Show theater

331
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,356
and turn it into a Muppet museum.
Isn't that great?

332
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,717
- No! I mean...
- What Walter's trying to tell you

333
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,634
is that Tex Richman has a secret plan to
tear down the theater and drill for oil.

334
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,756
- What?
- The only way to save the studio

335
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,190
is to raise ten million dollars.

336
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,397
Ten million dollars? That's impossible.

337
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,834
- But...
- The only way to raise

338
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,353
that kind of money would be to...

339
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,192
...would be to put on a show.

340
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,514
And I haven't seen the old gang
in a long, long time.

341
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,355
I guess people sort of forgot about us.

342
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,635
Hm?

343
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,111
# Is there more I could've said?

344
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,195
# Now they're only pictures in my head

345
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,356
# That's why my green is feeling gray

346
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,115
# Sometimes even frogs have rainy days

347
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,077
# Remember when the stage caved in
while you were rocking out?

348
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,760
# Who'd have thought your smorgasbord
would be hard to live without?

349
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,836
# If we could do it all again

350
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,069
# Just another chance to entertain

351
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,399
# Would anybody watch or even care?

352
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,229
# Or did something break
we can't repair?

353
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,395
# Your cannonball trajectory
It always gave me hope

354
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,390
# They may have been unbearable
but I still loved your jokes

355
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,036
# Is there more I could've said?

356
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,439
# Now they're only pictures in my head

357
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,675
I didn't do it. I've been framed!
Ahh. Wocka wocka!

358
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,917
Gonzo the Great
will ride this baby again!

359

[mumbling gibberish]

360
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,870
Muah!

361
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,708
This legato tune is posolutely,
most transparently bringing me down.

362
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,316
- For sure.
- One, two, and a half...

363
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,998

364
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,071
# Make'em laugh like we did then

365
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,789
# We can harmonize for one more song

366
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,716
# But I'm standing here instead

367
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:11,353
# Now they're only pictures in my head #

368
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,910
Well, it sounds like you guys aren't
getting back together anytime soon.

369
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,796
Mmm...

370
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,520
This is going to be
a really short movie.

371
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,673
But, Kermit, you have to try.

372
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,116
I... The Muppets are amazing.

373
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,835
You give people the greatest gift
that can ever be given.

374
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,560
- Children?
- No, the other gift.

375
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,756
- Ice cream?
- No, no. After that.

376
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,391
- Laughter?
- Yes!

377
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,199
The third greatest gift ever!

378
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,750
Kermit, your fans never left you,
the world hasn't forgotten.

379
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,349
All you need to do is show'em again!

380
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,919
Hmm.

381
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,838
I don't think so, guys. [sighs]

382
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,595
Don't you see, Kermit?

383
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,274
It's time to play the music.

384
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,550
# It's time to light the lights

385
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,393
# It's time to meet the Muppets... #

386
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,353
[playing piano]

387
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,511
Please, Kermit.

388
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,911
You're my hero.

389
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,791
You're on my watch.

390
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,192
Well, I... I guess...

391
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,154
...we could try.

392
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,231
- We?
- Well, yeah, listen.

393
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,595
If I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna need some moral support.

394
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,673
Well, that's perfect.
We're experts at moral support.

395
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,717
- Yeah!
- Good. I guess if we're gonna go,

396
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,791
we better get going.
We got a lot of people to find.

397
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,997
Oh, great! But wait,
how do we find'em?

398
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,310
Didn't you see our first movie?

399
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,792
We drive.

400
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,430
[# Gary Numan: "Cars"]

401
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,556
- So where do we go first?
- I shall take the liberty

402
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,035
of using my modem to locate the Muppets.

403
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,713
- OK.
- Great.

404
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,271
- Oh, stop it!
- [loud beeping, static]

405
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,000
In the name of all
that's sacred, let it end!

406
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,438
R-E-N-O. That spells "Reno."

407
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,109
You have reached your destination.
My guidance ends here.

408
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,468
[Kermit] Well, I guess
this is the place.

409
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,509
[man] Good evening, folks,
and welcome to Pechoolo Casino!

410
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,636
# Why are there such great deals

411
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,837
# On our hotel rooms?

# Free parking for cars

# The owners, the Moopets and me #

Cha-cha-cha!

420
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,593
Thank you, thank you.
We'll be back in six minutes.

421
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,749
- [few claps]
- Hmm.

422
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,160
- Hi-ho, Fozzie.
- Hi-ho, Kermit.

423
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,118
Kermit? [stammers]
What are you doing here?

424
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,556
Well, I... I just want to tell you
that was a great show.

425
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,797
It was... very informative.

426
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,632
I do my best to
keep it fresh each night.

427
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,552
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, I'm Fozzie, by the way.

428
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,553
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is Gary and Mary.

429
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,837
And this here is Walter.
He's a personal friend.

430
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,833
- Yeah.
- So I said, "What are you looking at?"

431
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,310
So I punched him in the face! I mean...

432
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,233
- Let's talk in my dressing room.
- Sure.

433
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,551
- OK.
- Here we are.

434
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,034
Make yourselves at home.

435
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,629
- Wow.
- [distant sirens blaring]

436
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,714
This is not quite what I expected,

437
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,515
- based on your Christmas cards.
- Oh, yeah. About that...

438
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,672
Oh, but it's nice, and... and airy.

439
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,796
Maybe we should give them some space.

440
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,837
I know, but I wanna hear
what they're gonna say. OK.

441
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,150
[Fozzie] Sixty-four shows nightly
can get pretty grueling.

442
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,869
Fozzie, an evil oil baron wants
to tear down our old Muppet studio.

443
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,474
- What? Oh, no!
- [sirens blaring]

444
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,518
- I mean, that's a shame.
- [gunshots]

445
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,353
[policeman] Step out of the vehicle!

446
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,317
Hey, Fozzie...

447
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,754
I'm sorry I haven't
been in touch more.

448
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:47,072
It's fine, Kermit. Look at me!
Living the dream!

449
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,355
- [thunder claps]
- Uh-oh.

450
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,239
Oh, no! Not this again!

451
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,039
- Quick, save the cushions!
- The cushions?

452
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,878
I'm sorry, Fozzie.

453
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,156
If I'd known you were here
in this place...

454
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,357
That's all right, Kermit.
It's not your fault.

455
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,030
- We had a good run.
- Yeah.

456
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,236
Yeah, it's just that...

457
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,275
Well, we haven't seen each other
in a really long time, and I...

458
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,113
I just thought maybe we could raise
the money to buy the theater back

459
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,517
if we all got together
and put on one last show.

460
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,389
A show? But I've spent years
building a solo career.

461
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,791
I have a whole new show-biz
family that loves me.

462
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,709
Fozzie! What the heck
are you doing, hibernating?

463
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,070
Next show starts in 30 seconds.

464
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:42,110
We hired you, and we can fire you,
so get your butt in here now!

465
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,872
- [door slams]
- [shuddering]

466
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,679
- They terrify me. Let's go.
- Let's go.

467
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,838
- Watch out for the forklift, Fozzie.
- [Fozzie] Oh, thanks.

468
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,355
Wow! Gonzo's doing really well!

469
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,589
According to 80's Robot,

470
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,194
he's the richest plumbing magnate
in the Rust Belt.

471
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,359
You! Order 28,000 tons of
plumber's putty from Beijing.

472
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,432
- [man] Right away, sir.
- And, you, send the 28,000 tons

473
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,238
of Silly Putty back to Beijing.

474
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,913
- [man 2] You bet.
- Oh, and you?

475
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,429
A memo to the waterless
toilet department.

476
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,194
I don't care about the mess,
just keep trying.

477
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,638
- Hi, Gonzo.
- Kermit? Fozzie? This is a surprise.

478
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,037
- We need to speak to you.
- All right. Have a seat.

479
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,151
Ah. Thank you!

480
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,757
- I think I'll stand.
- No, really, you should try one! Comfy.

481
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,353
It's our executive line of used toilets.

482
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,512
Anyway, I'm very busy.
I've got 30 seconds. Go.

483
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,158
Uh... Gonzo, I'm not quite
sure how to say this, but...

484
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,952
Don't forget to mention
the evil oil baron.

485
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,509
Yes, Fozzie, I was about to.
Just give me a moment, OK?

486
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,671
[clears throat]
Gonzo, it would appear...

487
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,353
Remember, evil oil baron.

488
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,034
Fozzie, I'm going
to get to that. Please!

489
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,236
- As I was trying to say...
- Evil oil baron.

490
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,517
- [buzzer sounds]
- OK, time's up. Thank you, guys.

491
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:01,470
Gonzo, we're trying to get the
old gang back together again.

492
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,428
- We really need you.
- My answer is no. Good day!

493
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,675
Come on, guys. We should go.

494
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,792
I just want to say, when I was a kid,
I saw you recite Hamlet

495
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,633
while jumping your motorbike
through a flaming hoop, and...

496
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,236
...it made me feel
like I could do anything.

497
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,392
Thank you. Yeah.

498
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,190
[clucking]

499
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,509
- Good try, Walter.
- [Gonzo] Hey, guys, up here!

500
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,557
- Ya-haa!
- Huh?

501
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,514
I've been wearing this under
my suit every single day for years!

502
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,073
Look out below!

503
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,878
- [yelling]
- [clucking]

504
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,793
Whoa, where you going?
You threw me off-balance!

505
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,316
I can't see! Apollo 13!

506
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,919
- [clucking]
- [grunts]

507
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,157
Citizens of Earth,
the Great Gonzo is back.

508
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,716
I pledge never to hold a plunger again!

509
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,029
[beeping]

510
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,711
Run! Run! Run for your lives!
Run, run, run!

511
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,998
- Run, guys!
- Run!

512
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,479
Oh, my gosh, run everybody!

513
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,518
It's gonna be big!
It's gonna be a big one!

514
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,637
[coughing]

515
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,917
Wow! That was an
expensive looking explosion!

516
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,514
I can't believe we
had that in the budget.

517
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,439
[woman] So maybe if you
look inside yourself,

518
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,639
the person you should be
most angry at is you.

519
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,835
Is you.

520
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,675
How have you been feeling?
Any more control issues?

521
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,434
In control.

522
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,591
- Good.
- [Kermit whispering] Psst. Animal!

523
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,911
- [woman] Excellent.
- It's me, Kermit.

524
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,278
Hey, we're having a meeting here, man.
You're being really rude, frog!

525
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,477
Pardon us, please. Animal,
I need to talk to you for a second.

526
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,593
We're getting the Muppets back together.
We need you to drum again.

527
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,318
- Animal drum?
- Yes!

528
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,476
- Please, sir.
- Drum! Drum, drum!

529
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,790
- Drum, drum, drum!
- OK, OK.

530
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,040
- In control.
- Good.

531
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,475
I'm Animal's court-appointed sponsor.

532
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,791
We don't use the "d-r-u-m" word.

533
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,996
- It's his trigger word.
- His trigger word?

534
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,509
Excuse me, Mr. Black.
I'm so sorry to interrupt,

535
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,750
but it's very important to these guys
that they get their drummer...

536
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,709
Gary!

537
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,518
It's my trigger word, too.

538
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,434
Jack, we talked about this on Tuesday.

539
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,830
Tuesday's another one
of my trigger words!

540
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,073
Oh, I don't think so!

541
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,154
Sorry.

542
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,072
- Let's go, Animal.
- Bye-bye!

543
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,312
- Animal, heel.
- Go, Animal! Be free, man!

544
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,149
But remember! No drumming!

545
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,074
Mr. Kermit, may I suggest
we save time and pick up

546
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,390
the rest of the Muppets using a montage?

547
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,676
[Kermit] Great idea, 80's Robot.

548
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,319
[# AC/DC: "Back in Black"]

549
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,392
We greatly appreciate
your financial support.

550
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,598
[80's Robot] Eighty-seven point three
miles to go. Eighty-seven point two...

551
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,478
[Kermit] 80's Robot,
do you have to do that?

552
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,312
...the secrets of the universe...

553
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,958
[screaming]

554
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,874
I guess we're in.

555
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,671
Welcome to this week's edition
of "Everything Stinks."

556
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,190
Whoa!

557
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,679
Bye, Lisa.
Off to the TED Conference.

558
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,114
Three, two, one.

559
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,679
[cackles]

560
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,713
Think we should've rented a bigger car?

561
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,396
Hey, wait for me!
I wanna help save the studio!

562
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,872
I wanna go with you! Oh, not again.

563
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,152
Wow. I can't believe
we're all back together.

564
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,878
Even all you guys
who weren't in the montage!

565
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,231
Yeah, how come you
didn't use me in the montage?

566
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,391
I thought my story
was pretty interesting.

567
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,269
- [snoring]
- Rowlf? Wanna get back together?

568
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,555
- OK.
- Good.

569
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,671
[chuckles] Classic.

570
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,592
Anyhow, looks like we got everybody,

571
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,910
so we can plan our telethon
and raise that ten million dollars.

572
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,798
- Well, not everybody.
- No, I think everybody's here.

573
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,188
- Where's...?
- All good!

574
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,634
- Miss...
- All done here!

575
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,233
- Piggy?
- [sighs]

576
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,113
Kermit, we're going
to get Miss Piggy, right?

577
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,470
OK, OK, OK, you're right.
We'll go get Piggy!

578
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,789
- [phone dialing]
- [all exclaiming]

579
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,475
My Minitel tells me
she is in Paris, France.

580
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,312
Oh! Well, then we drive to France.

581
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,393
- You can't drive to France, Walter.
- Yeah. It's way too far.

582
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,312
Then maybe we should travel by map!

583
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,710
- Good idea, Fozzie.
- Yeah!

584
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,277
[exclaiming]

585
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,792
[gasps]

586
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,919
To Paris!

587
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,991
[Animal] Paris! Paris!

588
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,319
[man speaking French]

589
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,759
[Walter] Look at these ceilings!

590
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,473
[Fozzie] Yeah. They must
be very tall here.

591
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,359
- [Kermit] Yeah, very nice.
- [keyboard clacking]

592
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,593
Uh... Hi there. Excuse me.

593
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,875
Miss? Pardon me, ma'am?

594
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,759
Hi there! We're here to see
Miss Piggy, and it's urgent.

595
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,831
Urgent! Urgent!

596
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,877
- Is it urgent?
- Very. Yes.

597
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,511
Let's have a look then, shall we?
She has an opening in...

598
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,434
- ...early September.
- Early September?

599
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,158
That's like six months from now!

600
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,232
That's nothing. Once I waited
a whole year for September.

601
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,075
She is the plus-size editor.
She's a huge deal and extremely busy.

602
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,958
You can't just pop in
without an appointment.

603
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,395
- OK, then.
- Thank you.

604
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,198
- [woman] All right.
- [Animal] Mean lady.

605
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,920
- Close the door on your way out.
- [Kermit] Thanks a lot.

606
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,950
- She wasn't very nice.
- [Kermit] Yeah.

607
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,113
Guys! Muppet Man!

608
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,590
- Yeah!
- That could work!

609
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,035
[knocking on door]

610
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,313
Hello.

611
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,115
[grunting]

612
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,074
I have an appointment.

613
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,876
Oh, OK.

614
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,433
Um...

615
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,953
Will you wait here a moment?

616
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,759
[Miss Piggy] Decisions, decisions.

617
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,919
- Eeny, meeny, miny, mo. I choose you.
- [knocking]

618
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,069
- [door opens]
- [laughing]

619
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,549
- [chomping]
- Mademoiselle Cochonnet?

620
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,479
- Can't you see I'm busy?
- [woman] Of course.

621
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,036
There's a... man here to see you.

622
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,589
He does have an appointment.

623
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,830
An appointment? That's weird.

624
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,718
Well, why didn't you say so?
Send him in!

625
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,029
Right away. Sorry.

626
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,200
- Ahahaha.
- Remember, left foot, right foot.

627
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,349
Hello.

628
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,999
- Whoa.
- [crashing]

629
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,952
- What the...?
- [Fozzie] Sorry.

630
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,593
That looked expensive.

631
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,797
[grunting]

632
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,552
- You look familiar.
- So do you!

633
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,352
Please, have a seat.

634
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,159
Yes, we're going to have a seat now.

635
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,073
- No, no, no, don't sit down!
- Oh, sorry! Whoa!

636
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,036
Uh-oh.

637
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,557
Message to head. Left leg in trouble!
Going down. Left leg going down!

638
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,675
What?

639
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,955
- Ohh!
- [grunting]

640
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,315
I can't believe I fell for Muppet Man.

641
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,835
- [Mary] You guys OK?
- [Gary] Is anyone hurt?

642
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,715
Kermit?

643
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,559
- Hello, Piggy.
- Kermie!

644
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,599
Oh, Kermie, Kermie, Kermie, Kermie,
Kermie, Kermie, Kermie, Kermie, Kermie!

645
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,069
Mm, mm, mm. Kissy-kissy.
Mm, mm, mm!

646
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,870
Wait! What am I doing?
I promised myself I'd never go back!

647
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:30,750
I am woman! I am strong!
You must leave at once!

648
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,909
[speaks French]

649
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,594
- OK.
- No, no, wait, wait!

650
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,911
Miss Piggy!
The Muppet Studios are in danger.

651
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,993
In danger? Our studios? Kermit!

652
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,631
It's true, Piggy. And we need
to do The Muppet Show again.

653
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,835
We need you.

654
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,835
Oh.

655
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,999
Before I decide anything,
I need to talk with you, frog.

656
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,957
[speaks French]

657
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,198
Alone.

658
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,276
[chattering]

659
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:13,075
Piggy? Last time we were together,
I said some things I regret.

660
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,596
No. No, Kermit.
You were just being honest.

661
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,955
You never intended to marry me.

662
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,951
Not even after I built us a house

663
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,793
where we could raise tadpoles
and grow old together.

664
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,919
Well, who do you think's been looking
after that house all these years, huh?

665
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,311
Piggy, why do you have to always
be so overdramatic about things?

666
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,710
You know, it leaves me no choice
but to do things that hurt you.

667
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,236
I am who I am. Why can't
you accept that about me?

668
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,197

835
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,999
Look how we cleaned this place
up today, you know?

836
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,833
Same old team, all pulling together.

837
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,073
I guess you're right.
Night-night, Kermit.

838
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,629
Good night, Fozzie.

839
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,916
[sighs]

840
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:55,359
OK, gather round, troops! Everybody,
time to get this rehearsal going.

841
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,636
- Scooter, is everybody here?
- Almost everyone, chief.

842
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,792
- Yeah...
- Hey, anybody got any kerosene?

843
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,037
I wanna take these old pig
dresses out back and burn'em.

844
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,192
[Miss Piggy echoing]
Hold it right there, sausage snout!

845
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,993
- Piggy?
- Huh?

846
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,748
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

847
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,672
Come on. Keep it up, Maurice.

848
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:24,233
Sorry, Miss Piggy, but you've
been replaced... permanently.

849
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:27,671
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

850
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,913
I don't think so... sister?

851
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:36,039
Who you calling sister, sister?

852
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,196
- Oh, look, an omelet station!
- Oh, where?

853
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,078
- Hiya!
- [grunts]

854
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,677
There's only one Miss Piggy,
and she is moi.

855
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:49,675
Yeah, well, you ain't seen
the last of me! I'll be back!

856
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,711
Yeah, yeah. Heard of mouthwash?

857
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,275
- Welcome back, Miss Piggy.
- [all chattering]

858
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,954
All right, all right, don't crowd me!

859
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,190
Wow, she sure hasn't changed.

860
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,151
Piggy? You came back.

861
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:06,949
I'm not here for you, Kermit.
I'm here for them.

862
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,109
[door shuts]

863
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,115
And, besides,
when this show's done,

864
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,869
I'm catching the next plane
back to my life in Paris.

865
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,828
OK, Piggy, OK. Places for the
opening number, everybody!

866
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:19,989
[growling]

867
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,518
Oh, good morning, Veronica.

868
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:27,117
- Morning, Frog.
- OK, everybody, take it from the top.

869
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,748
- [playing music]
- Oooh!

870
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,951
- You missed your cue.
- I know!

871
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,109
[crashing]

872
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,430
There's kind of
a rhythm to this, you know?

873
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:41,189
Uh... Oh, and if you like that one,
what's the bear capital of the world?

874
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,952
Mos-cow!

875
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,358
[laughing]

876
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,828
Ha.

877
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,796
# It's time to play the music

878
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,951
- # It's time to light the lights
- Two, three, four.

879
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,917
# It's time to put on makeup

880
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,036
# It's time to dress up right #

881
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,800
Hey guys, stop. Cut, cut, cut,
cut, cut. What's the problem?

882
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,714
We can't keep time without
the drums, man! We need drums!

883
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,270
- Sorry, Animal.
- [grunting] No drums! No drums!

884
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,955
- Jack Black said no drums!
- Animal, heel! Sit!

885
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,030
[sighs]

886
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,589
- Who's next? Oh.
- [Animal] In control.

887
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,471
- Hey, Walter?
- Oh. Yes, Kermit?

888
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,954
You think you might
wanna help us out here?

889
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,315
- Maybe do something in the show?
- [sighs]

890
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,074
Kermit, you know,
you've been so nice to me,

891
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:33,268
but I have to face the facts.
See, the Muppets are so talented...

892
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,358
Hey, guys, check it out! Fart shoes!

893
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,839
[flatulence sounds]

894
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,070
- Patent pending!
- And...

895
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,748
...I don't have any talent at all.

896
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:47,118
The truth is... [sighs]
I can't perform with you guys.

897
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,113
I feel like a phony just being here.

898
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,999
Walter, just because you haven't
found your talent yet,

899
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:56,994
doesn't mean you don't have one.
If you look inside yourself,

900
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,958
I'm sure you'll find something
that you're really good at.

901
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,837
OK, Kermit. I'll try.

902
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,117
[woman] Take my picture!

903
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,430
Welcome.
How many in your party? Two?

904
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,398
Uh... No, just the one.

905
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,313
[chuckles]
All right, party of one, follow me.

906
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:33,434
# I look around, and once
again I'm on my own

907
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:37,275
# My man ain't here
He's gone and done me wrong

908
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,432
# No one's gonna stop this girl
from having fun

909
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,876
# I throw my hands up high
and have a party for one

910
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:47,874
# I'm having a me party
A party by myself

911
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,555
# A me party
I don't need nobody else

912
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:55,599
# A me party
I'm the first and last to show

913
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,719
# There's no one at this party
that I don't already know

914
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,555
# I'm not gonna sit around
by myself and wait for you

915
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,598
# Haven't you heard?
One is the new two

916
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:10,118
# I'm gonna make a scene
I'm gonna make a fuss

917
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:14,717
# Tonight I'm gonna celebrate
with just the one of us

918
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,550
# I'm having a me party

919
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,676
# Haven't I seen me here before?

920
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,393
# A me party

921
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,471
# I'm the last one on the dance floor

922
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,950
- # Me party
- # A party just for moi

923
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,635
- # Me party
- # It's a solo Mardi Gras

924
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,475
# I'm having a me party
I'm such good company

925
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,155
- # A me party
- # I saved the last dance for me

926
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,991
[vocalizing]

927
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:47,393
# What happens at a me party
stays at a me party #

928
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,599
Excuse me, miss, are you
expecting anyone else?

929
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,228
Oh... no.

930
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,709
No, it's just me. Party of one.

931
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,638
- [bell dings]
- [man] Order up!

932
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,351
- OK, cue 17 is Fozzie's intro.
- Hey, Scooter? What's left?

933
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,715
Oh, uh, it's you, chief!

934
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,429
- Hm?
- Your duet. With Piggy.

935
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,709
[knocking softly]

936
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,711
[Miss Piggy singing
"(I've Had The) Time of My Life"]

937
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,313
- Miss Piggy?
- Hm?

938
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,351
We're all out front practicing our acts

939
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,028
and seems that everybody expects
you and I to do a duet, so...

940
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,875
Oh, that's so lovely,
but I'm afraid I can't.

941
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:28,591
No, no, you see, I'm already doing
a duet with my new dance partner.

942
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,552
Hola. [laughs]

943
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,551
OK, come on, rehearsing,
let's go. We gotta break it up.

944
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,029
- Excuse us.
- 'Scuse us.

945
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,952
Let's try that lift again, shall we?

946
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,680
[scoffs] The lift again.
OK, on my count this time, OK?

947
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,553
- In three, two... Wait for me!
- [crashing]

948
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,789
Good grief.

949
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,633
Kermit! There you are. I've been
looking for you everywhere!

950
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,193
So nice to see you, Veronica.

951
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,271
Who's hosting?
Did you find a celebrity?

952
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:54,319
Yeah, well, I've wanted to talk to you
about that, you see, because...

953
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:58,672
Well, actually, I'm kind of a celebrity.

954
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,159
You? [scoffs]

955
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,117
No. Kermit, listen.

956
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:06,034
I will not air the show unless
you find a real celebrity host.

957
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,117
I will rerun Benson if I have to.

958
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:11,198
Yeah, you see, the thing is, Veronica,

959
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:14,193
that's kind of impossible
because the show's in 12 hours!

960
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,839
Twelve hours!

961
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:20,318
I might as well just go and ask Tex
Richman to give us the studio back!

962
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:27,278
And the Muppets are like a big family.
Well... And for us,

963
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:32,833
that theater is... is like our home.
Which is why, in conclusion...

964
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,990
...we humbly ask that you
give us back our studio.

965
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,317
It would certainly mean a lot to us.

966
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,351
Hmmm.

967
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:48,232
Well, Mr. The Frog, let me see.

968
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,755
[singing]

969
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:21,994
Correct!

970
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,429
The answer is no.

971
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,478
Well, you could've just said that.

972
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,517
- Contract.
- Contract.

973
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,715
Contract.

974
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,159
- Nicely done, sir.
- You see, Muppets,

975
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,231
according to this contract,

976
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,188
it's not just this studio
you lose the rights to tonight,

977
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,351
- it's the Muppet name itself.
- What?

978
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:59,115
And all characters
under the Muppet name.

979
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,352
Wait a second. What possible use
could you have for our names?

980
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,873
[beeping]

981
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,150
Told ya I'd be back.

982
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,396
Well, now I am...

983
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,194
...back.

984
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:22,195
And I see you've met Mr. Richman,
our new business partner.

985
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:28,549
The Moopets are a hard, cynical act
for a hard, cynical world.

986
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:34,989
Hey, Fozzie! I want you
to meet a friend of mine.

987
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,479
[laughing]

988
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,149
- Wocka wocka.
- You're relics, Muppets!

989
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,596
The world has moved on,
and no one cares about

990
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:49,709
your goody-goody, hippy-dippy,
Julie Andrews and Dom DeLuise hostin',

991
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:53,509
singin'-and-dancin' act anymore!
You're dead!

992
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,911
- [gasps]
- And I just come to bury you.

993
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:01,389
Now, get out of my office.

994
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,073
- What?
- What is that supposed to mean?

995
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,639
You said you were gonna talk to the man!

996
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:09,078
Guys! OK, so maybe
Kermit signed away the theater

997
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,949
and the Muppet name, but as long
as we have a celebrity host,

998
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:16,908
we can still pull off a heart-warming,
last-minute triumph, right, Kermit?

999
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:21,795
Well, actually I
don't see how we can, Fozzie.

1000
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,154
- Huh?
- [man] What?

1001
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,958
Guys, the show's in six hours,

1002
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:29,750
and we're barely rehearsed,
and, well, I...

1003
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,751
I couldn't get us a celebrity host.

1004
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,990
- Oh, no!
- What?

1005
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:39,595
I'm afraid Tex Richman's right.
The world's moved on.

1006
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,716
I'm sorry I dragged you guys
into this mess.

1007
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,751
Kermit?

1008
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,073
All right, listen up, you freaks!

1009
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,834
I didn't come 5,000 miles
to not be on TV.

1010
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,630
All we need is one stinkin' celebrity,
and by any means necessary.

1011
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:04,828
Now, the frog's gone.
We're doing things my way from now on.

1012
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,479
Let's move!

1013
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:08,869
[alarms blaring]

1014
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,235
- Hey!
- Hi.

1015
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,432
- How was your day?
- Oh, it was great.

1016
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,751
I went to Guinness Book
of World Records... alone.

1017
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,275
Then Ripley's Believe It or Not... solo.

1018
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,874
And then I ate lunch unaccompanied,

1019
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,231
and then I walked back here...
independently.

1020
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,153
Listen, I got you these.

1021
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:32,551
You know, to make up for the
other ones. The broken ones.

1022
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,312
Thanks, sweetie.

1023
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,433
Listen, Gary.

1024
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:41,797
I was just wondering what
the plan was for dinner tonight.

1025
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,393
Oh, I don't care.
What do you feel like?

1026
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:48,279
OK. That's fine.

1027
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,677
That's just fine.
That's... that's perfect.

1028
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,236
I'm going to go for a walk.

1029
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,749
- Individually.
- [door opens]

1030
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:02,157
[whistling]

1031
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,431
[humming]

1032
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,352
- Walter, hey.
- [Walter] Gary.

1033
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:11,637
Oh, where have you been? I need you
to help me figure out a talent.

1034
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,313
A talent for what?

1035
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:17,473
For the show. Kermit asked me
to do an act in the show.

1036
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:20,359
I... I could be a Muppet.

1037
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,353
Wow. Wow, Walter, that's amazing.

1038
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,273
Yeah, but I need to
figure out if I have a talent.

1039
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,749
Well, you know what?
I'm sure you'll think of something,

1040
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,434
but right now I actually...
I need your help.

1041
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:35,672
I'm starting to get the feeling that
Mary's upset with me about something,

1042
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:39,276
and I don't know what, and I was hoping
maybe you would talk to her for me.

1043
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,555
Gary, I'd love to help you out,

1044
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,757
but I can't leave the theater now.
This is important.

1045
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,957
Well, hold on a second.
I mean, my life is important, too.

1046
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:49,435
Yeah, but the whole reason we came here
was to see the Muppets.

1047
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,955
No, it wasn't!
The whole reason we came here

1048
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:54,429
was to take a vacation where
I took Mary out to a fancy dinner

1049
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,272
because it's our tenth
anniversary, and then...

1050
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,309
- Walter, what day is today?
- Friday.

1051
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:04,392
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

1052
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:08,109
This is bad.
Walter, this is really bad. I have to...

1053
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,999
- Mary? Mary!
- Wait.

1054
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:14,357
Gary, I need you.

1055
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,198
OK, is everybody ready?

1056
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:34,670
Commence Operation
Celebri-nap. Masks on!

1057
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:37,070
- Masks on!
- Except for moi.

1058
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:38,753
Nothing covers this beautiful face.

1059
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:43,317
- [gasps] No maskin'?
- No maskin'.

1060
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,911
[man] Check the door on Stage 28.

1061
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,514
- [man 2] I'm going over there now.
- [man on radio] She's done in makeup...

1062
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,797
[panting]

1063
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:01,352
I told you, I'm not done
putting on my balls!

1064
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,273
Oh, hey, Animal.

1065
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,595
What are you doin' here?

1066
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,878
Acting. Natural.

1067
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,229
[Miss Piggy] Now!

1068
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,475
Whoa!

1069
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,392
- Hiya!
- [yelling]

1070
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,752
[grunting]

1071
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:26,955
[yelling]

1072
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:31,994
[mumbling]

1073
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:36,994
Hiya!

1074
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:46,074
Mary, surprise! I figured out
why you're mad... at me.

1075
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,837
[Mary] Gary, I've gone home.

1076
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:01,589
I love you, but you need
to decide, are you a man

1077
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,671
or a Muppet?

1078
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,792
# I reflect on my reflection

1079
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:23,794
# And I ask myself the question

1080
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:29,796
# What's the right direction to go?

1081
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,595
# I don't know

1082
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:38,390
# Am I a man

1083
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:43,111
- # Or am I a Muppet?
- # Am I a Muppet?

1084
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,397
# If I'm a Muppet
Then I'm a very manly Muppet

1085
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:50,109
- # Very manly Muppet
- # Am I a Muppet?

1086
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:53,431
- # Muppet
- # Or am I a man?

1087
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,029
# Am I a man?

1088
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:59,670
# If I'm a man that makes
me a Muppet of a man

1089
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:02,195
# A Muppet of a man

1090
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:09,717
# I look into these eyes

1091
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:13,077
# And I don't recognize

1092
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:17,637
# The one I see inside

1093
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:23,434
# It's time for me to decide

1094
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:27,639
# Am I a man

1095
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,637
# Or am I a Muppet?

1096
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:32,274
# Am I a Muppet?

1097
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:35,750
# If I'm a Muppet
Well, I'm a very manly Muppet

1098
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:39,674
- # Very manly Muppet
- # Am I a Muppet?

1099
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,673
- # Muppet
- # Or am I a man?

1100
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,990
# Am I a man?

1101
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:49,392
# If I'm a man that makes
me a Muppet of a man

1102
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,676
# A Muppet of a man

1103
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,879
# Here I go again

1104
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,918
# I'm always running out of time

1105
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:02,272
# I think I made up my mind

1106
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:06,228
# Now I understand who I am

1107
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:12,271
# I'm a man

1108
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:15,910
# I'm a Muppet

1109
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:24,116
- # I'm a Muppet of a man
- # I'm a very manly Muppet

1110
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:28,636
# I'm a Muppet-y man

1111
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,313
I'm so sorry.

1112
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,914
- Oh, Gary.
- Mary.

1113
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:50,869
# That's what I am #

1114
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:01,192
Kermit. We have our celebrity!

1115
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:04,955
Mr. Jack Black has graciously
agreed to do the telethon!

1116
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:07,554
Oh, my gosh, that's amazing.
Where is he?

1117
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:10,632
- In the trunk.
- [Jack] Get me outta here!

1118
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,712
You kidnapped Jack Black?
That's illegal!

1119
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:18,431
But, Kermit, what's more illegal,
briefly inconveniencing Jack Black,

1120
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:23,116
- or destroying the Muppets?
- Kidnapping Jack Black, Fozzie!

1121
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,556
Kermit, listen. Whatever
I may think of you right now,

1122
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:29,393
these guys are counting on you.
You inspire them.

1123
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:32,279
- What, to kidnap people?
- To work together.

1124
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:36,274
- To kidnap people?
- Mr. The Frog, we all agreed

1125
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:39,113
a celebrity is not a people.

1126
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,636
And now that we have a celebrity,
the show's back on.

1127
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:46,395
Come on, Kermit.
Don't let these guys down now.

1128
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,279
[sighs]

1129
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,119
All right. Well, what are you
guys still doing here, huh?

1130
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,719
- It's showtime!
- All right!

1131
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:55,915
That's it!

1132
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:01,189
- Nicely done, sir. As usual.
- En garde.

1133
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,558
Ow! Ow.

1134
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,950
OK, very nice. [grunts]

1135
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,270
Halt! Point left!

1136
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,238
Well done, sir. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

1137
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,756
[man on TV] And coming up next on CDE,
The Muppet Telethon.

1138
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,309
Kermit and friends host
a celebrity-studded gala,

1139
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,155
- with special guest, Jack Black.
- Oh! He's pretty good.

1140
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:23,435
[grunts]

1141
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:28,388
- We're going to phase two.
- Yes, Mr. Richman.

1142
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,919
[groans]

1143
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,551
So do you think we're
working for the bad guy?

1144
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,676
Hurry! The show starts in ten minutes!

1145
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:42,114
[tires squealing]

1146
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:44,712
Where did you learn to drive?

1147
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,956
Hang on, everyone!

1148
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,873
Come on, guys. OK, listen up, everybody!
This is it! Five minutes to curtain!

1149
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:59,031
- Kermit?
- Get ready for the opening number.

1150
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,872
- Yes?
- I need to talk to you about my act.

1151
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,871
Listen, Walter,
I know you're gonna be fine.

1152
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,110
In fact, I'm sure you'll be great.
Scooter, who's up first?

1153
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,633
- Come on, come on, come on!
- No...

1154
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,153
[Kermit] Fly in the arches!

1155
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:09,309
- [sighs]
- [clucking]

1156
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,394
- OK, first we have the opening theme.
- Of course. Yeah.

1157
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:14,357
- You come out and introduce Fozzie.
- Right.

1158
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:17,193
Then we have...
TV executive at six o'clock!

1159
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:20,198
- What?
- The show is a disaster, Frog!

1160
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:22,430
- Veronica...
- Where's the audience?

1161
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,034
I knew you guys
weren't popular anymore.

1162
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:28,198
I should have trusted that chart.
There's no one here!

1163
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:29,998
- What about Hobo Joe?
- Who?

1164
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,628
Why does everybody
forget about Hobo Joe?

1165
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,552
- Just a second. Scooter!
- Yeah, chief?

1166
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:38,429
- Did you hand out all those flyers?
- Of course. Every last one!

1167
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,989
Don't worry.
We'll think of something!

1168
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,479
- You better.
- [grunts]

1169
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,671
Yoo-hoo! You've got audience.

1170
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,638
It's me! What am I, invisible?

1171
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,995
- [knocking]
- Jack Black.

1172
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,912
Fifteen seconds to curtain, Mr. Black.

1173
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:55,069
- Hi!
- Ah! Where am I?

1174
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:58,357
Why am I so fancy? What are you doing?
You're ruining my look!

1175
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,909
- We'll see you out there! Good luck!
- [Jack] Stop cleaning me!

1176
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:05,073
- You sure got nice teeth, Jack Black.
- Yeah.

1177
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:07,475
We're here!

1178
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:10,108
- Start the show!
- Ready for some kind of entertainment!

1179
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,475
All right, good luck, everyone,
and cue Scooter.

1180
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,552
OK, we go live in three, two...

1181
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:22,151
[man] Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome your host, Kermit the Frog.

1182
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:24,877
It's The Muppet Telethon,

1183
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:29,352
with our very special guest,
Mr. Jack Black! Yay!

1184

[up-tempo music playing]

1185
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,078
# It's time to play the music

1186
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,271
# It's time to light the lights

1187
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:49,319
# It's time to meet the Muppets
on The Muppet Show tonight

1188
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:51,630
# It's time to put on makeup

# It's time to dress up right

1190
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,796
# It's time to get things started

1191
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,275
# Why don't you get things started?

1192
01:09:58,440 --> 01:09:59,839
I always dreamed we'd be back here.

1193
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,036
Dreams? Those were nightmares!

1194
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,792
# It's time to get things started

1195
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:07,157

[Tarzan cry]

1198
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:21,351
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to The Muppet Telethon!

1199
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,592
We have Muppets standing by
to take your calls.

1200
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,478
- Yes, we are.
- Hi. Hello.

1201
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,949
Could I have a large pizza
with ham and...?

1202
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:32,232
Yes, and, boy, do we have
a wonderful show for you,

1203
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,358
with our special guest, Mr. Jack Black!

1204
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,478
- [horns sounding]
- [laughing]

1205
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,517
I'm being held captive by these weirdos!

1206
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:43,797
Now you know how we've felt
for the past 40 years!

1207
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:47,236
Somebody, anybody, please call
the police. This is real rope!

1208
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,517
- Man, this 3-D is incredible!
- This is real!

1209
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,440
Oh, and by the way, folks, we have
plenty of room here in the audience,

1210
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:57,030
so if you'd like to come down
and see the show live...

1211
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:00,829
There's no audience in the theater.
Look, it's totally empty.

1212
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,518
Poor Walter.

1213
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,039
Maybe we should go back.

1214
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:13,916
No way, Mary.
I've made my choice already.

1215
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:15,872
I just sang a whole song about it.

1216
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,469
I wanna stay here with you.

1217
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:21,555
So thank you.

[band plays]

1219
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:31,435
Ladies and gentlemen,
prepare yourselves

1220
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:35,189
for the Great Gonzo's
most amazing feat ever.

1221
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,637
- Head bowling.
- What? No!

1222
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,153
I have not signed off on this!

1223
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,595
- [laughing]
- Drumroll, please.

1224
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:47,668
- [dinging]
- And a one and a two and a three!

1225
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,798
Uh-oh. Uh... My fingers got stuck.

1226
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,474
All part of the act, folks. Stay tuned.

1227
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:54,755
[laughing]

1228
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:56,956
Please, make this end! Please!

1229
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:58,593
This is great. Call'em.

1230

[buzzing]

1232
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,916
Hello?

1233
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:11,231
You wanna give us some money?!
Uhhh...

1234
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:14,949
- Say yes!
- Yes! We will take that money!

1235
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:19,557
[laughing]
Hey, guys, we got us some money!

1236
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:24,794
Oh, yeah, tickets. Here we are.
Tickets. Thank you.

1237
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,714
Five dollars to show you your seat.
It's up there somewhere.

1238
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:31,792
- Help!
- OK, thank you, Gonzo.

1239
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:34,520
Thank you very much. Ladies and
gentlemen, we will see what happens with

1240
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,796
head bowling
a little later in the show.

1241
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:41,397
Up next is our furry funny man,
Mr. Fozzie Bear! Yay!

1242
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,995
Thank you, thank you, and thank you.

1243
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,913
Boy, did I go to
a bad seafood place last night.

1244
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:52,039
The catch of the day was salmonella.
Wocka wocka!

1245
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:55,237
- OK.
- Ah! That joke's like 50 years old!

1246
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:56,276
[laughing]

1247
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:58,192
[Fozzie] So how'bout
those shopping centers?

1248
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:00,794
You seen one,
you seen a mall! Take it.

1249
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,871
Make it stop!

1250
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,553
[laughing]

1251
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:09,840
- Wocka wocka wocka wocka!
- [Jack] Make it stop! No!

1252
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,310
- We're not a team! I'm not with him!
- What is happening?

1253
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:16,517
People are actually watching this?

1254
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:20,116
Deadly! Bring the car!

1255
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:22,159
What am I gonna do?

1256
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,435
- What am I gonna do?
- [knocking]

1257
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,273
Walter? Sixty seconds
till you're on, Walter.

1258
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:28,237
You ready?

1259
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,437
No. Yes, yes, yes...

1260
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,111
Whoopi Goldberg?

1261
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:36,953
Selena Gomez? And... hi there.

1262
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:40,952
Yeah, look, somebody said there
might be a career opportunity here,

1263
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,509
- something about saving a theater.
- Yes, yes, of course.

1264
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,274
I don't really know who you guys are.
My agent just told me to show up.

1265
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:47,708
- That's great.
- Are you one of the

1266
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,074
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?

1267
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,993
Yes, I am, and let me
show you how you can help.

1268
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:55,630
And don't worry. It's just your
one shot to go on live TV

1269
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,916
before millions of people
to prove you have what it takes

1270
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,793
to become one of the Muppets.
Good luck.

1271
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,200
Up next, folks, I am proud
to present a brand-new act

1272
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:10,158
to the show. Introducing Walter.

- [screaming]
- [crashing]

1275
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,879
[Fozzie] That's not good.

1276
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:27,115
[clears throat] It appears that
Walter has stepped out, so it's...

1277
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:31,319
Well, it's back to the days of
yore down at the old barbershop.

1278

Oh, no! It's a barbershop quartet!
Get me out of here!

[vocalizing "Smells Like Teen Spirit"]

1283
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,751
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?

1284
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:57,150
Is that Nirvana? Stop it! No!

1285
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,715
You're ruining one of the
greatest songs of all time!

1286
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:08,799
Ow!

1287
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,359
Careful around the ears!

1288
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,589
[groans]

1289
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,520
[high pitched]
Ah! That was hot!

1290
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:36,831
Hey! What's going on here?
Why is my body so big?

1291
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,594
What'd you do to my voice?
I sound like a chipmunk!

1292
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,870
Wait a second.
Did you guys shrink my head?

1293
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:44,873
[Kermit] Ladies and gentlemen,
Jack Black!

1294
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,837
[applause]

1295
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,751
Nice work, everybody. [mumbles]
Chickens, you're up next!

1296
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:53,275
It's going rather nicely.
We might just make this.

1297
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,190
And now I am
pleased and proud to present

1298
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,631
those princesses of poultry,
Camilla and friends!

Let's hear it for Camilla
and her farmyard friends!

1303
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,952
No, I... I don't know
why I'm not hosting this.

1304
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:54,680
So remember, folks, keep on calling
and you'll help us reach our goal

1305
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,440
of ten million dollars by midnight.
And if...

- [power failing]

1307

Oh, dear.

[Kermit] Ladies and gentlemen,
don't be alarmed.

1309
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,798
We will get this sorted out
just as soon as we can. Scooter!

[crackling, sizzling]

1311
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:14,118
Well, that's that. Nice try, Muppets!

1313
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:22,032
[Fozzie] Kermit, how are we going to
raise the rest of the money

1314
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:23,355
with no electricity?

1315
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,750
[Kermit] All right,
calm down, everybody.

1316
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:32,353
- Is everybody OK?
- Yeah.

1317
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:35,080
Well, we can't do the show
without power.

1318
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:38,152
- Anybody got any bright ideas?
- Not now, Fozzie.

the power back?

01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,871
We're gonna have to get up on that roof

1328
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:09,476
and shut'em down for good!
Bolt cutters!

1329
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,835
Bolt cutters.

1330
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,235
Deadly! You come with me.

1331
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,239
That's it.

1332
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,753
Hm.

1333
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:30,030
To the end of the Muppets!

1334
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,952
[grunts]

1335
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:34,190
Deadly! What are you doing?

1336
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:35,952
Enough!

1337
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:40,636
Just because I have a terrifying name
and an evil English accent,

1338
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,837
does not preclude the
fact that, in my heart,

1339
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,869
I am a Muppet, not a Moopet!

1340
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:52,794
Looks like it's I who
will have the last laugh!

1341
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:56,475
- What does that mean?
- It's an idiom, you idiot,

1342
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:00,474
because you cannot laugh!
Ha ha!

1343
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,153
- [thudding]
- Oopsie.

1344
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,878
[Deadly laughing]

1345
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,155
Deadly.

1346
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:09,392
Now that's a maniacal laugh for you!

1347
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:12,552
Hey, Gary, Mary, how'd
you guys get here so fast?

1348
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:14,790
We travelled by map.
We thought it'd be quicker.

1349
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:17,997
Hey, I'm sorry I bailed. I just...

1350
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:20,230
I realized you don't let
the most important person

1351
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:22,715
in your world slip away.

1352
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,957
- Hey, Scooter?
- Yeah?

1353
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:34,469
Could you do me a favor
and take over hosting duty?

1354
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:37,438
But, chief, I don't go onstage.

1355
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:41,149
Well, just do what I do.
Pretend that the audience is naked.

1356
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:42,878
Yeah, but, I...

1357
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,917
Ha... ha... ha...

1358
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:46,468
[knocking]

1359
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:48,474
Uh, Miss Piggy?

1360
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59,832
[audience applauding]

1361
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:04,832
[stuttering]

1362
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,310
- You are all naked.
- [gasping]

1363
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,879
[Scooter] Well, sorta.

1364
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:13,555
OK. Great!
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

1365
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:16,792
please welcome, a real hero...

1366
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:28,919
[Miss Piggy] You saved it?
After all this time?

1367
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:32,072
Oh, Kermie.

1368
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:45,794
[clears throat] I guess I'm not
that good at saying this kind of stuff.

1369
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:48,110
- Yes, Kermie?
- Well...

1370
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:53,758
...over the last week,
I realized that...

1371
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:56,514
...I... I miss you.

1372
01:20:57,560 --> 01:21:00,870
And I need you.

1373
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:07,632
And maybe you don't need the,
the whole world to love you.

1374
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:11,950
Maybe you just need one person.

1375
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:18,279
It's time for our song,
and if we don't raise the money tonight,

1376
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,829
it might be the
last time we sing together.

1377
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:21,989
[murmuring]

1378
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:26,631
And... Well, are you ready?

1379
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:29,517
Oh, Kermie.

1380
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:34,992
[banjo playing]

1381
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,799
# Why are there so many

1382
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,878
# Songs about rainbows?

1383
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:48,710
# And what's on the other side?

1384
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:53,078
# Rainbows are visions

1385
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:56,312
# But only illusions

1386
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:01,110
# And rainbows have nothing to hide

1387
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,836
# So we've been told

1388
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,118
# And some choose to believe it

1389
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:14,115
# I know they're wrong
Wait and see

1390
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,997
# Someday we'll find it

1391
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:21,317
# The rainbow connection

1392
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:26,110
# The lovers, the dreamers and me

1393
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:30,159
# All of us under its spell

1394
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,072
# We know that it's

1395
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:37,109
# Probably magic

1396
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,120
# Have you been half asleep

1397
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:44,556
# And have you heard voices?

1398
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:48,918
# I've heard them calling my name

1399
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:52,349
[panting]

1400
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,794
Hey, these are yours, man.

1401
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:57,996
I kept'em for ya.

1402
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:00,475
- Drum.
- No drum.

1403
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:02,517
- Drum!
- No drum!

1404
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,796
- Drum! Drum!
- No drum! No drum!

1405
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,958
[yelling]

1406
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,476
You know what to do.

1407
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:21,199
# I've heard it too many times
to ignore it

1408
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:26,354
# It's something that
I'm supposed to be

1409
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:30,870

[all vocalizing]

Drum! Drum, drum! Drum!

1414
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:56,078
Ah ha ha ha ha.

1415
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:57,958
- You still got it, man!
- [applause]

1416
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:03,194
Piggy? Will you stay... for me?

1417
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,590
- For you, Kermie?
- Yeah.

1418
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,909
Of course!

1419
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:13,589
Woo hoo!

1420
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:22,199
Thank you, everybody.

1421
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:24,794
Thank you, all.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1422
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:29,238
it's almost midnight and we haven't
quite reached our target yet,

1423
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:33,916
but if you'll all just stick around,
we'll be right back with our final act.

1424
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:37,993
[man on PA] The Muppet Telethon
will return after these messages.

1425
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:44,709
Walter? Walter, where are you, buddy?

1426
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:48,509
Listen, everybody, the show ran short,
and we don't have anything else planned.

1427
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:49,795
[gasping]

1428
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,552
We need one last act
to bring us home.

1429
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:54,518
I'm gonna go check on Jack Black
and see if he has any ideas.

1430
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:55,999
You guys see if you can
come up with something.

1431
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:58,196
We have two minutes! Two minutes!

1432
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:01,710
- Think, think, think!
- [Fozzie] What am I thinking?

1433
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:05,190
Walter. Walt!

1434
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:07,917
- Walter!
- Gary?

1435
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:11,510
- Wha... You came back.
- Walter.

1436
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:13,398
What are you doing down here?

1437
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:17,189
They just need one more act. You gotta
get out there and help those guys.

1438
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:21,797
I can't. What if people
laugh at me? I...

1439
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:26,511
I'd rather go back home to Smalltown.
With you.

1440
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,798
Look, Walter, you're my brother,

1441
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:37,557
and I'm always gonna love you,
but you belong here, with these guys.

1442
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:40,837
Hey, you're the one
who got Kermit to do this.

1443
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,560
You're the one who brought
everyone here together.

1444
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:48,350
You always believe in other people,
but that's easy.

1445
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:51,876
Sooner or later, you gotta
believe in yourself, too,

1446
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:55,038
because that's what growing up is.

1447
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:58,953
It's becoming who you want to be.

1448
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:02,829
You have to try. Please, Walter.

1449
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,434
You're my hero.

1450
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,395
[ticking]

1451
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:18,915
- [ticking]
- [bell dings]

1452
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:22,072
OK, Jack Black's got nothing.
What did you guys come up with?

1453
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:25,636
- Bunsen can set Beaker on fire.
- No, no, no, we can't do that.

1454
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:28,553
- I could break out the fart shoes.
- No, no, no, that will never work!

1455
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:29,869
[man on P.A.]
We're back in three, two...

1456
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,160
Oh, no!

1457
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:37,719
[slow whistling]

1458
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:43,198
[whistling]

1459
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,038
It's Walter.

1460
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,191
[whistles up-tempo song with orchestra]

1461
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:32,191
[whistling higher octave]

1462
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:35,432
- [hitting high note]
- [glass shattering]

1463
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:39,870
[finale with orchestra]

1464
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:50,396
[applause]

1465
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:54,712
Thank you.

1466
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:59,112
- He's all grown up.
- Oh, that was wonderful!

1467
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:04,909
[Kermit] Ladies and gentlemen, Walter!

1468
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:07,674
It looks like we're going
to get our studio back!

1469
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:11,919
This just in: the Muppets are
about to take back their studio.

1470
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:14,196
- [engine starts]
- [tires squealing]

1471
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:21,273
[80's Robot] Help! I've been mugged.
Alerting authorities.

1472
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,835
- [woman on phone] We're sorry...
- What happened? Hello?

1473
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,673
- Hello?
- Guys, my phone is dead.

1474
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:32,358
News flash: My phone is also dead.
Repeat, my phone is also dead.

1475
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:36,718
[all] Ooh...

1476
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,078
- [bell ringing]
- [groaning]

1477
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:46,673
[audience gasps]

1478
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:51,589
I did it. I beat you.

1479
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:59,994
Game over, Kermit. You lost.

1480
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,639
[groaning]

1481
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:02,835
Chicky!

1482
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:07,232
Too late, Muppets. I won!
Turn that thing off!

1483
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:10,876
- The show is over!
- [audience gasps]

1484
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:12,792
But we were so close!

1485
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:16,316
- [whirring]
- [audience gasps]

1486
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,515
Or not.

1487
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:22,796
It kinda makes me
feel better, honestly.

1488
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,594
I mean, we were
nowhere close at all.

1489
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:29,833
You artists formerly
known as the Muppets

1490
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,798
are standing on private property.

1491
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:35,838
My private property.

1492
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,798
And I'm telling you to leave. Now!

1493
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,359
[whimpering]

1494
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:49,753
He's right, everybody.

1495
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:53,469
He won. We gotta go.

1496
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:56,192

[Rowlf] Not now, Fozzie.

1500

[flatulence sounds cease]

1501
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:13,634
- I can't believe this.
- I know.

1502
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:21,310
Well, that's that.

It can't end like this.

1506

[chattering]

1508
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:52,157
Listen, everybody, we've got nothing
to be ashamed of. And you know why?

1509
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:58,359
Well, because thanks
to Walter here, we tried.

1510
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,795
And if we failed, we failed together,

1511
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:06,273
and to me, that's not failing at all.

1512
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:09,233
And I don't care what anybody says.

1513
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:15,675
And I don't care if no one
believes in us, because I believe.

1514
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,877
- I believe in you.
- Huh?

1515
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:21,156
- And you.
- Me?

1516
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:25,199
- And you.
- [sighs]

1517
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:28,272
You know, what's important
isn't this building or a name.

1518
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:31,159
It's each other. So I say, fine,

1519
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:33,914
let's just start at the bottom
and work our way back up to the top.

1520
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:37,072
- [all] Yeah.
- Let's all walk out through these doors

1521
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:42,678
with our heads held high. As a family.

1522
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:46,719
- Because that's what we are.
- [all] Yeah. Yeah.

- Yes. Come!

1536

Get over there.

1537
