00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:18,897
You said you're going to a marriage.
But you're not wearing any jewels.

Hey! Wait...he's having
the bail order.

lt's against law, if we keep a man
in jail with a bail.

Will you give me the bail and
come out of the jail?

97
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,725
lf you write on a white paper,
it's warrant.

98
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,730
lf Gandhi smiles on a green note,
is it a bail order?

99
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,570
You're maintaining
law & order perfectly. - Sir bail!

Put this man into the jail
instead of him.

102
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,574
We can change people
but can we change names?

103
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,076
What's this man's name?
- Kuppusaamy.

104
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,578
That man's name?
- Saamy.

105
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:57,578
Add `Kuppu' before Saamy's name.

00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:58,977
And put this `Kuppa' (trash)
into the jail.

107
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:00,949
How did you manage it?

108
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,554
You were arrested yesterday
but out today.

109
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:03,584
lt's the power of money.

110
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,916
Where can l get this `matter'?
- You mean `Marijuana'?

111
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,922
lf you go to ''Rettai Marathadi''

'Sugar cane refuse'?

Girls! MLA is running it as a wholesale
trade in Melapalayam.

116

Ward & district level leaders are
doing it in retail in lodges.

117
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,934
Not only that spurious liquor is
brewed behind the market.

Rowdies are spreading out to
4 states from our place only.

00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:35,449
Annachi Perumal Pitchai is the
king pin of this illegal trade.

122
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,618
Why are you asking me
all the details?

123
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,958
l never asked, you told me
everything yourself.

124
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,354
Oh! ls this known as making
others sing?

125

Hey! What's going on man?
Leave him...

00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:55,807
Hey what did he do?
- Sir, he stole my briefcase.

127
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,479
How dare you steal a briefcase

Give it to me.

129

Constable, put him into the jeep.

130
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:05,809
Whose briefcase is this?

131
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,315
Sir, it's mine, there are
Rs.3 lakhs cash in it.

132
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,650
Let it be there! Come to the station,
sign the papers and take it.

133
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,154
Hey! Why are you gathering

00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,002
Sir greetings!
- Who's stopping the police jeep?

135
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,835
lf police like you resort to stealing,
what do we thieves do then?

136
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,173
Give me way.

137
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:35,347
Brother, you can't go from here
without answering me.

138
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,015
Hey! Run over the jeep on him.

139
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,380
He said he's Saamy (God) but he's
beating like a devil.

140
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:22,843
Give it man.

141
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,013
Hey, stop it man!

142
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:30,519
How dare a rowdy like you
beat a policeman?

143
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,453
Am l a vandal and you a policeman?

144
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,695
You're not a D.D. Dandapani
but KD(vandal) Dandapani.

145
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,527
Looks like you'll give your uniform
to make him a policeman.

146
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,530
He's a wastrel, you're supporting him.
Arrest him.

Who are you?

00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,716
And you're robbing people here?

153

Arrest him.

154
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,132

Once more... - Yes sir.

156
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,579
He's taking us to task for salute.
Don't know what's in store.

Who hoisted this flag?
- l did sir.

158

You've hoisted it 3 inches lower!

159
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,753
l couldn't see 3 inch difference
at the height of 30 feet.

160
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,750
Then, you wouldn't be able to see a
thief 30 feet away from you.

161
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:37,922
One week's suspension!

162
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,588
Oh God! Then l think
l'll be dismissed.

163

Do you know march past?
- They've forgotten all that.

164
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:43,591
Poor guys!

165
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,923
They've become like statutes
standing in one place for 20 years.

166
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,928
But l'm not like them sir
if you say l'll achieve it.

167
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:49,930
lf you say milk l'll become butter
if you say pulse l'll become sambar.

168
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,102
lf l say fire, will you
immolate yourself?

169
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,429
Will you kill if l
pay you money?

170
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:55,936
Will you throw out Kuppa (trash) and
add `Kuppa' to Saamy's name.

171
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:57,605
First zip up your pant.
- Yes sir.

172
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,108
Look here! l'm telling
everyone.

173
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,946
Go and get drunk any where.

174
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,774
Wear shoes or not?
Cut hair or not?

175
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,609
Wear uniform or not?
Wear your cap or not?

176
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,115
l'm not bothered about all these.

177
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:11,115
You must follow the orders strictly,
if anyone bungles or refuses.

178
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,117
No warnings, suspensions or dismissals.

179
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,790
l'll kill you overnight and throw
your bodies into river Thamaraparani.

180
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:16,619
Mind it!

181
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,956
100 Criminals might escape,
forget about them.

182
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:20,791
But an innocent should
never be punished.

183
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,631
A policeman must be proud.

184
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:26,800
lf anyone disturbs peace in public places.
Bash him up right there.

185
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:30,141
We must be a friend to people
and a rogue to rogues.

186
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,641
We policemen should salute
only our National flag.

187
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,810
lt's a town with a radius
of just 5 kms.

188
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:37,311
Though so many policemen are here, still
crimes are being committed regularly.

189
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:38,642
Who's responsible for it?

190
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,143
Mr.Paramasivam! - Yes sir.

191
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:41,649
Buses, lorries plying in Tirunelveli,

192
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:42,980
Wine shops, jewellery shops,
provision shops,

193
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,816
Lodges, hotels, colleges
businessmen, students,

194
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,317
Government servants, lawyers, doctors,

195
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,824
l want the entire list of people in
this town within 24 hours.

196
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:50,653
Why do you want doctors list?

197
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,660
l must know the number
of fake doctors.

198
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,599
Unwanted lorries shouldn't
enter the town.

199
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,665
Buses shouldn't stop at
unnecessary places.

200
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:59,162
No one should be in a petty shop
for more than 10 minutes.

201
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,168
A group of 4 people shouldn't
walk on the roads.

202
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,008
Most important, no one must tie their
lungies above their thighs.

203
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,608
lf they refuse,
kick their butts.

204
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,176
Sir, this is like MlSA rule.

205
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:08,171
What is my name?

206
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,507
Read it from the end `SA' `Ml'! MlSA.

207
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,515
l'm not a policeman but a rogue.

208
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:48,382
Rascal!

209
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,923
Unload it slowly,
don't hurt yourself.

210
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:54,882
l'll supply mustard, pepper, cumin and
fenugreek in 50 & 100 gms pack.

211
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:58,893
l'll supply sugar in 1 kg pack.
Take delivery tomorrow.

212
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,843
Sir, Rs.4,500, last week's bill.

213
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,071
Give it to my grand daughter as usual.

214
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,247
Come here for a moment.

215
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:24,915
Grandpa, did you call me?
- Yes.

216
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:26,420
Take that money and keep it safely.

217
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,089
Sugar bag appears very weak.
ls it not feeling well?

218
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:34,094
What's the weight of this bag?
- 100 kgs.

219
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:35,926
You bought it after
weighing it, didn't you?

220
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:38,261
No, l must weigh it now.
- Weigh it & show me.

221
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,937
Hey! Put the bag on weighing scale.

222
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,538
lt's 94 kgs. only!
What happened to 6 kgs?

223
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:51,610
ls it for this bag only or
is it a feature to all your bags?

224
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,778
lf your proprietor comes to know,
you'll lose your job.

225
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:58,285
We get 40 paise per packet
as commission.

226
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,219
We are doing it to supplement
our meager earnings.

227
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,290
You are making us lose money.
- Forgive me sir.

228
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:03,119
l'll take leave mother

229
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,122
Hereafter this mistake
will not be repeated.

230
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,960
Your son is labour officer
for name's sake only.

231
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:14,465
lf he takes bribe from shop owners
he'll easily make money.

232
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:19,133
He's talking like a mad man
about honesty, sincerity.

233
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:22,802
That's why we are struggling
to meet both ends meet.

234
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:24,642
Grandpa, don't criticize dad.

235
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,485
Desiring other's money is a sin.

236
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,320
Money earned by hard work
only, will be with us.

237
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,720
Mother, l've taken
Rs.100 for bus pass.

238
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,787
Grandma, l'll go to college.
- Okay dear.

239
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:34,822
Sister, l'll go.

240
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,995
Meenakshi, your husband
is not to be seen all day?

241
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:42,062
Yes, is your son-in-law behaving
like a brahmin?

242
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:43,996
He went to conduct a sacrifice.

243
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:46,329
Don't know where he might be
picking up trouble now?

244
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,508
Stop, park your vehicle aside.
- Have you started it?

245
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:55,680
l'm on my way to conduct
a ceremony.

246
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,178
Let's take care of things
while coming back.

247
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,612
Forget it, park it aside and
take out your documents.

248
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,513
Documents mean?
- lnsurance.

249
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,685
For me, you or my bike?
- Of the bike?

250
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,118
Then, take it.

251
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,860
R.C.book! - Take R.C book.

252
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,689
Road tax! - There's no road but
you're asking for road tax.

253
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,523
What's this you're riding the bike without
changing the number plate?

254
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:18,031
Take it.

255
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:19,362
Why are you showing
like channel V?

256
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:22,539
You're changing rules at
the drop of a hat.

257
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:25,369
So, l've a white, black and
yellow number plate.

258
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:29,445
When you decide,
l'll fix that number plate.

259
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,878
You can fix it later, take out
your license. - License?

260
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,814
Take it...Check it.

261
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:39,052
You're without the tuft
in this photo.

262
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:41,051
That photo was taken
when l was a student.

263
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,385
So, l didn't have a tuft then.

264
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:46,155
lt is passport size photo,
infact l had gone there without pant.

265
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,559
Do you need all that?

266
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,394
How to make him pay fine?
Can you do an 8?

267
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,328
Not that, on your bike
can you do it?

268
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,904
Would they grant me a license
without doing that?

269
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:59,243
Then, make a 7 on your bike
- 7?

270
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:02,743
l think he's expecting some
bribe from me.

271
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,583
Come & sit on my bike
l'll do a 7.5.

272
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:10,187
How can you do that?
- Sit man, l'll show you.

273
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:14,587
l'm sitting. - Your bad time
starts now, pray to god.

274
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:21,262
Go slowly! - This is second installment
it has just started.

275
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:25,766
Are you killing me in installments!
- This is 3rd round.

276
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:30,504
Watch out, l'm doing a 7.5 on bike.
lsn't it fine? - Leave me, priest.

277
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:34,440
l'll show you how to repent.

278
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:42,119
Mr. Priest.

279
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:46,450
l asked your number plate and you
made me a nameless policeman.

280
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:48,285
That is real bad time.

281
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:50,624
Hey! Where's my left hand?

282
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,128
lt fell near Rettaipalam bridge.
Didn't you pick it up?

283
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:57,301
You're are referring to it as a cheap pencil?
- l'll get it for you.

284
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,318
Why does he never pray to
god at the temple?

285
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:25,322
Why are you looking at
me like this?

286
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:30,930
An astrologer told me to visit the temple
on Fridays or else l'll die.

287
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,661
Otherwise why would l come
to visit this man?

288
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:37,504
Saamy, l'll not spare you without
packing you to Singapore.

289
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:41,509
Book a ticket to God's idol from
Tuticorin port to Singapore.

290
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:42,179
As you say.

291
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:53,020
He's a millionaire!

292
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,783
But, his name is
Perumal Pitchai(Beggar).

293
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:58,029
lt seems God had collected
food in alms.

294
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,198
And Hanuman snatched it from his
hands & enjoyed eating it.

295
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:04,027
But here, l'll snatch & l'll eat.

296
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:10,533
40 years ago, l was begging
in this temple.

297
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:15,310
So, l had changed my name from
llaya Perumal to Perumal Pitchai (Beggar).

298
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,038
Enough!

299
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:18,875
Greetings sir.

300
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:21,882
He's garlanding a rogue
instead of god.

301
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:26,415
Why did you garland me?
Are you changing party? - No Annachi.

302
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:30,216
A by-election is scheduled for
SriVaikuntam. Brother needs your support.

303
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:32,491
l've already made you two as MLA's.

304
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,391
Do you want one more?

305
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:36,999
There's only one bridge
in SriVaikuntam.

306
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,829
Only one bus can go on it, at a time.

307
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,403
Are you planning to bring it down?
- Nothing like that sir.

308
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:42,903
Okay, you want to contest
the election.

309
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:46,236
Subramani, are you doing well?
- l'm fine.

310
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:49,239
He stole a woman's jewels when she
bent to give him alms.

311
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:50,243
Today, he's a big shot.

312
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:52,014
l know him very well.

313
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,852
Even if l give him Rs. 10 lakhs.

314
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:59,251
He'll make a golden begging bowl
and beg in Singapore.

315
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:04,926
Sir, we've got information that
Coimbatore MP is going to Guruvayoor.

316
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:11,595
A man who was hiding without
even going to Parliament.

317
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:13,934
lf he's daring to come out, it means...

318
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:18,442
Kill him! - Annachi, situation
is very bad.

319
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:23,444
Are we killing for money, to be returned,
if we fail in our mission.

320
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:26,113
Political murders must be committed
at regular intervals.

321
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:30,112
lll fated guy! Bloody man is
going to a temple to die.

322
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,665
Sir, you'll never get married?
- Why?

323
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:41,962
You're searching
so many houses to live.

324
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:43,634
How many girls would
you see to marry one?

325
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:44,798
Don't worry if we
fail to get one.

326
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:45,970
We've police quarters
as the last resort.

327
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,799
This's the house mentioned
by the shop keeper.

328
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:55,271
Whom do you want?

329
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,807
We've come to see a house for rent.
- Who are you?

330
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:00,246
l'm an lnspector and he's
Deputy Commissioner.

331
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:07,491
Just wait there.

332
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:13,028
Grandma, last week two people stole in the
disguise of policemen, they're here.

333
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:14,788
Yes, did you close
the door properly?

334
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,830
Grandma, we must plan
and catch them.

335
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:18,832
Why do you want to take
unnecessary risk?

336
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:21,334
Aunt, be ready with
chili powder.

337
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,166
You all come immediately,
when l call you, come grandma.

338
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,178
We'll come late at nights,
there's only one way here.

339
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,506
What can we do if they lock it?
- We must break the lock.

340
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,011
Don't we know it?
- Didn't l tell you?

341
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:35,352
Come...come...please.

342
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:37,521
This is the hall,
a very large one.

343
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:42,125
You can place the sofa,
Sit or do anything.

344
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:44,528
Why is she speaking
like a loose (mad)?

345
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:47,197
Yes, loose...the door latch
is little loose.

346
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,525
lt'll be okay if we tighten it.

347
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:53,026
Grandma is old, but really bold.
- They say old is gold.

348
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,202
They said upstairs is vacant.
But, you're showing the downstairs.

349
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:58,035
Our first floor and ground
floors are alike. - Yes.

350
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:01,303
lf you see one you
needn't see another.

351
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,947
This is middle of the house,
that is the store room.

352
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:05,548
You can stock groceries.

353
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,877
This is prayer room
to pray to god.

354
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,383
ls the entire family mad?
- That's kitchen.

355
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:13,148
You can cook, fry, eat or do anything.
- Clever girl.

356
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,883
That is bedroom!
- You can sleep, take rest.

357
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,226
You said it right, go inside
and see. - No need.

358
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,899
Go inside!
- Hey why are you pushing us inside?

359
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,401
Aunt...Aunt! All of you come here.
We've caught the thieves.

360
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:28,834
Thieves! Tell them, who are we?

361
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,738
How many people we would've arrested?

362
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:32,409
Today 2 mad women
have arrested us.

363
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:35,507
Wait, did you call the police? - Yes.

364
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:38,082
Aunt, we are real police.

365
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:39,750
Last week 2 guys
said the same thing.

366
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,748
Aunt, please listen to me.

367
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:45,915
What happened?

368
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,926
Sir, they threw chili
powder on my face.

369
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:50,423
Why are you laughing sir?

370
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:52,926
What happened madam?

371
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:55,599
Open the door carefully, 2 strong
bull like men are there. - Yes.

372
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:56,934
Aim your rifles at them.

373
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:58,762
Sir, will your gun fire?

374
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:01,431
Look at the way they're
coming out, beat them.

375
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:04,767
Sir, what's this?
- Did you call him a thief?

376
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:06,603
He's our Deputy Commissioner.

377
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:09,109
Deputy Commissioner?

378
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:13,375
A mistake has been
committed unknowingly.

379
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:14,110
Please forgive us...

380
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,288
Last week, a similar incident
happened in the next street.

381
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:18,956
That's why my grand daughter
mistook you.

382
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,659
Sorry! - Forgive us.

383
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:28,297
That is the way out.

384
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,125
Give me some ''idlies''...
l'll have them with this side dish.

385
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:40,807
Greetings sir...

386
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:41,671
Greetings sir...

387
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,814
lf we leave it as it is, it'll
become a problem. - Okay...okay..

388
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:45,312
New Deputy Commissioner
has come to see you.

389
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:50,150
Welcome, Deputy Commissioner...

390
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,585

Place...Palani.

391
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:56,653
Till now, you've been transferred to
7 places and this is your 8th place.

392
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:58,757
You never stayed at any place
for a long time...

393
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,828
You're such an honest man.

394
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:05,833
My boys told me this place has changed
a little after your arrival.

395
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,766
What are you looking at man?
l'm here ...

396
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:13,169
But l'm aware of all that's happening
in every nook & corner of lndia.

397
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:17,439
But nobody knows about me...
- l know...

398
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:21,085
Your original name is llaya Perumal,
63 years old, native place, Vallanadu.

399
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:24,513
Out of 123 wine shops in Tirunelveli,

400
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:27,247
You own 1 16 shops including
36 illegal shops.

401
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:29,123
Out of 80 lorries quarrying
sand from river Tamarabarani,

402
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,419
You own 75 lorries.

403
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,691
30 of them are running illegally.

404
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:35,599
18 omni buses plying to out stations
are without permits.

405
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:38,594
You own many lodges
under fictitious names.

406
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,528
They're being used for
illegal activities.

407
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:44,104
You've 3 ships in Tuticorin & 2 cracker
factories in Sivakasi. Apart from these,

408
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,004
Which ever party may come to power...

409
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:47,975
ln the 8 districts of south,

410
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:51,113
You select the winning &
losing MLA's & MP's.

411
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:55,279
Perumal Pitchai, kingmaker.

412
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,786
But your name will never be published
in the newspaper...

413
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,219
Your posters will never be seen.

414
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:04,122
After knowing all this, you won't
leave me without taking action.

415
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,796
But, if you take action
l won't spare you.

416
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,624
You won't take bribe also.

417
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,298
Which place you want to
be transferred? Tell me.

418
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:14,035
l'll help you...
- Who said that l won't take bribes?

419
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:15,971
My henchmen.

420
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:18,142
Hey! Give him a chair.
Go & bring it.

421
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:20,640
How much can you offer?

422
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:22,139
How much you want?

423
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:25,976
l want to do my duty.
l need your help for that.

424
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:26,980
l didn't get you.

425
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:28,812
ln city, your lorries
always cross speed limit,

426
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,317
and are frequently involved
in accidents.

427
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,988
They should be
within city speed limits.

428
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:34,483
Despite knowing, drinking liquor is
injurious to health, they drink.

429
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:36,319
l'm not bothered about them.

430
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:39,595
But if a drunkard creates a scene
on the road, l'll not spare him.

431
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,596
Your henchmen shouldn't come to me
for taking them out on bail.

432
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,168
l'm not bothered about your
illegal businesses.

433
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:47,230
But you should control local goons
who use your name.

434
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,665
Or else, l may have to control them
and you shouldn't get angry with me.

435
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,502
l don't care about your
illegal wine shops.

436
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:56,775
But, you've 7 shops near schools & temples
which are troublesome to people.

437
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,448
l'm not asking you to
close down those shops.

438
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:00,075
You can shift them to
some other place.

439
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:06,849
lf you agree to this,
l'll accept your money.

440
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:12,359
l think what you said is right.

441
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:15,032
Okay, l'll make arrangements.

442
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:17,701
Hey! Give him...take it...

443
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:24,366
l'll take leave...

444
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:26,543
Brother...

445
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:31,038
You said you're from Palani...
What is the caste you said...

446
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:32,041
l didn't say.

447
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:39,385
Sir, what's this?
Why did you act like a`Yes man'?

448
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:44,050
He seems to be from our caste.
- What do you mean?

449
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:46,630
Did you hear his brave words?

450
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:48,558
So, do we've to obey
all his commands?

451
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:52,133
He was not ordering us.
He told us politely.

452
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:54,903
His predecessors went against us.

453
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:57,074
Or else, they took bribe and
ruined the town.

454
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:58,902
He's different to them.

455
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,739
Not only that we are also facing
problems in those 7 shops.

456
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:04,240
let's shift them & see.

457
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:10,615
What's this? Why do you create so much
smoke like a dream sequence?

458
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:14,758
Shut up. Can't you
cut your hair?

459
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:17,257
Shut up! This's going to be
a fashion in 2005.

460
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:20,522
Watch out! Even Capt. Vijaykanth
will sport this hair style.

461
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,757
Not only that, for all priests,

462
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,936
it's traditional to sport
such a hair style...

463
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:27,761
Are you atleast doing that properly?

464
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:30,768
Wherever you go, you create trouble.
- What to do?

465
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,009
Last week, the marriage which
l had attended as a priest,

466
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:34,371
at the time of giving
the auspicious thread,

467
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:37,104
l saw the groom's face
and got shocked...

468
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:41,115
l had performed that rascal's
marriage a month earlier.

469
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,377
l was tensed.

470
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:44,951
l took a brick from
sacrificial fire,

471
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,954
asked him, ''How many girl's lives
are you going to ruin'',

472
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:50,123
l threw it on his face.

473
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,455
That's all.
He started to bleed profusely.

474
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:53,789
Then, it stopped.

475
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:54,794
Did the bleeding stop?

476
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,125
No...marriage was stopped.

477
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:59,997
lt's enough if you perform your job
properly without creating problem today.

478
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,138
You knot the hair soon...
l'll conduct it excellently...

479
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:02,806
l've already done it.

480
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,238
Rogues are not traveling on the
foot-board these days.

481
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:06,910
After the arrival of D.C. Arusaamy...

482
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:09,579
lf they do, they're beaten black & blue.

483
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,942
Oh God! l've lost my chain...

484
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:13,583
Driver, go to the police station...

485
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,015
Check every one.

486
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:20,921
Don't spare anyone.

487
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,454
Brahmin girl!

488
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,522
Stand in a line.

489
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,532
Can't you recognize a thief by face?
Do we look like thieves?

490
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,724
Didn't you throw
chili powder on our faces?

491
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,371
Hey! What's happening there?
- Sir, chain snatching...

492
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,206
They are making even girls
to stand in a line.

493
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:46,708
Why is he staring at us?

494
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,381
Show me your bag.
- We are getting late to college.

495
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:53,055
First check us...

496
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,656
Paramasivam, send them first.

497
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,985
Women police are coming
to check women.

498
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,888
When will they come
and when will we go?

499
00:34:59,097 --> 00:34:59,995
lt's alright, send them.

500
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:02,723
Sir, l'll not allow anyone
to disturb me in my duty.

501
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,925
Because, l'm not a police man
but a rogue.

502
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:08,705
You can go...
- What about the bus?

503
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,564
Bus will go after checking every one.

504
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:13,238
Then, how will we go?
- Go by an auto.

505
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:14,535
Money?

506
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:18,841
Don't you carry Rs.20, while going
to the college? - Rs.20!

507
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,642
We've a student bus pass.

508
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:23,753
lf by chance we lose it,
we've Rs.5 for to & fro fare.

509
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,946
We've curd rice & pickle for lunch.

510
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:28,591
Apart from this, why should a
college girl carry money?

511
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,789
Okay, l'll give you money.

512
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:34,429
Hey! Call an auto.
- We don't want other's money.

513
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,499
Okay, take it as loan
& repay it later.

514
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,199
His mind is getting distracted.

515
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:47,704
Sir, my wife isn't happy
about my late coming.

516
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:48,776
Atleast today let's go early.

517
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,914
Wait, let the night show be over.

518
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:54,282
He'll neither marry & enjoy
nor allow me to enjoy.

519
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,452
Why are you blabbering?

520
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:59,049
l was talking about the
greatness of bachelor's life.

521
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,789
Who's that?
Where are you coming from?

522
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:03,526
Sir, we went to a movie.
- Movie?

523
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:05,457
Didn't your husbands come with you?

524
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:06,322
No Sir.

525
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,123
Where is your house? - Vagedu.

526
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,266
Vagedu?...Are you going there
alone at this late hour?

527
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:12,231
Take this torch.
- No, it's alright.

528
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:13,528
lt's alright, take it.

529
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,603
Ask your husband to return it
in the station tomorrow.

530
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:18,400
Take it. - Okay sir, bye.

531
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,745
Sir take it. You've helped my wife.
Thank you very much.

532
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:26,781
Wife? Hey! Are you a man?

533
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:29,919
Neither you were courageous to take
your wife to the night show,

534
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:32,817
Nor you had the guts to
stop her from going alone.

535
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,218
Then, why did you marry?

536
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,390
After not stopping her from
going alone,

537
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:39,324
You complain that she has been
robbed, raped, murdered etc..

538
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,499
Hey! There are 550 million women
in our country.

539
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,497
ls it possible to provide police
security to every woman?

540
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,170
Paramasivam, hereafter you arrest
all the husbands,

541
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,671
Who send their wives alone to
movies. - Yes sir.

542
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:52,636
lf he had married, he would've known
the problem of a husband. - What?

543
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,572
Sir, nothing. l just tested whether
this torch is working or not.

544
00:36:54,879 --> 00:37:00,044
A white cat is living
in my house.

545
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:02,448
What's this Hubby?
Who are they?

546
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:07,989
They're very tired children.
Serve them food.

547
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:10,786
Oh God! lt's a great sin.
- Sin?

548
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,168
Why grandpa is shouting like this?
- Did he get a stroke?

549
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,134
Don't blabber. They're offering
food to the crows.

550
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,900
You'll offer food to the crows.
Won't you offer it to them?

551
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:27,202
Crows are our forefathers,
our ancestors.

552
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,380
Ancestors? ls an ordinary crow
your grandfather?

553
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,606
ls Raven, your great grand father?

554
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,375
Whom are you fooling?

555
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:38,715
Hey! Don't criticize the traditions,
you fool. - Forgive me grandpa.

556
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,915
Crows may satiate their hunger
by picking or stealing food.

557
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:45,323
Blue cross also protects them.

558
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:49,966
But for the poor & uneducated
like them,

559
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:52,795
White cross like us are
here to help.

560
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:55,268
Grandpa, do you know, because
of the food you offer to crows,

561
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,270
How many problems politicians
have to face?

562
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:58,100
What do you mean?

563
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,277
lt eats gravy food here,

564
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:03,970
And a rotten `Masal vada'
from a shop,

565
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:07,673
Mutton piece
from a mutton shop.

566
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:10,149
Eating all this, its stomach
gets upset.

567
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:13,585
Lastly they go & sit over
the Politician's head,

568
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,588
And shit like this.

569
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,227
Don't you've Rs.50? What's this man?
...Go, man...

570
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:28,267
Sir, l asked for his license
and he said `No'.

571
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,632
That's why, l warned him.

572
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,102
l believe...l believe you...

573
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,166
Why do you ask Rs.50 and
insult the police?

574
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:36,039
You ask Rs.500. To escape from the
trouble, he'll take a license,

575
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:37,544
And you can also avoid
asking bribes frequently.

576
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:42,412
ls he asking me take bribe or not?
l don't get him.

577
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:48,181
Why are you dull for the
past 2 days?

578
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:51,389
Hey! DC is there, l'll return
the auto fare.

579
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:55,924
Bus may start...
- l'll come back before that.

580
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:58,997
When will it be finished?
- The judgement is on 10th of next month.

581
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:02,195
You said, it's one day's work.
Remind me about it. - Yes sir.

582
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,802
Hello, What's it?

583
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:08,604
That day you gave me Rs.22.50
as auto fare, take it...

584
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:13,011
lt was Rs.45, why're you giving me
only Rs.22.50? - Rs.45?

585
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:18,345
Metre showed only Rs.22.50...
- He asked me for the return fare of Rs.22.50.

586
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:19,523
Oh God!

587
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:24,184
To repay Rs.22.50, l was
sleepless for 2 days.

588
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:26,522
l packed chili powder
in 60 packets.

589
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:32,098
Oh God! l missed the bus.
How will l go now? - You go by an auto.

590
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:34,965
What about the auto fare?
- How many of you've started this business?

591
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:38,141
You may not have much money,
but only Rs.5 for bus fare.

592
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:39,604
For lunch, you would've curd rice
& pickle.

593
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:42,540
No, today l've sambar rice & `pulse'
curry. - Let it be anything.

594
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:45,038
You'll say that why does a college girl
need money more than this?

595
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:47,774
Take it back. Keep your cash bag
with yourself.

596
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:48,950
Hey! Auto...

597
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,214
Your money... - Repay the total
money later.

598
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:56,050
Hey! Wait.

599
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,091
What's your name? - Sir, Murugan.

600
00:39:58,295 --> 00:39:59,887
Which area? - Pettai.

601
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:01,723
You know the station phone number?
- Yes sir.

602
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,991
lnform me on phone after dropping her.
- Okay sir. - Go.

603
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:09,703
Dhanam brother. - Yes sir.

604
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,670
You follow that auto.

605
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:13,002
Why did he ask you to
phone him?

606
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:16,304
l look like a rowdy, don't l?
That's why, he suspects me.

607
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:21,083
ls DCP your relative? He's very concerned
about you! - Nothing like that.

608
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:24,283
Then, why is he sending a
constable to follow us?

609
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:30,819
After Saamy sir's arrival, Tirunelveli
junction is entirely changed.

610
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:32,893
All those vandals on roads have
gone into hibernation.

611
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,565
Wow, whether the auto runs or not,
metre runs perfectly...

612
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,234
He's an honest man...

613
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,706
Do you know how much
he's concerned about me?

614
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,043
Don't move around with a policeman. Forget it,
or else l'll inform aunt.

615
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:59,287
You tell aunt or Saamy (god).
- Again Saamy!

616
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:02,220
He's a good person...
He's an honest man.

617
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:04,792
Bhuvana, do you know who's the guest
for tomorrow's function?

618
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:06,622
Deputy Commissioner Saamy!

619
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:15,101
What's it Annachi?
You've made me jobless.

620
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,206
Earlier atleast once in a month
we used to hear the blasts.

621
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:19,535
Now, there's no sound and l feel as
if l've become deaf.

622
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:22,473
Don't you know anything else
other than planting bombs?

623
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:27,850
l've made you the proprietor of a
35 acre crackers factory in Sivakasi.

624
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:31,579
You're standing here like a lamp post
leaving behind your brain in Sivakasi.

625
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:34,952
A dog will always remain loyal
to lick it's boss's feet.

626
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,389
lf we allow him, he may plant
a bomb here itself.

627
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,028
First send him to Sivakasi.

628
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,424
Brother, come let's go
to bus station.

629
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:41,996
l'll call you when l need you.

630
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:45,567
Greetings, sir... - Greeting sir...

631
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,095
Annachi...

632
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:48,168
He is taking bath.

633
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,475
Generally people can hold breath
for 2 minutes under water.

634
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:55,345
But Annachi can hold for 10 minutes.

635
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,672
Welcome Saamy.

636
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:01,576
What are you looking at?

637
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,950
Surprised as to how l know about
your arrival?

638
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:10,190
Even from under 10 feet water,
l can recognize anyone.

639
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:12,862
l'm used to take bath here
since my childhood.

640
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:15,827
Neither l know it's virtues
nor sins..

641
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:22,462
l made him a MLA.

642
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:24,732
But, he made tall promises that
he'll give this & that,

643
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,603
Sanction water supply etc.,
on the stage.

644
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:29,711
Believing him, farmers are
waiting with their implements.

645
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:34,317
Even CM used to ask me before
saying anything on the stage.

646
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,543
He went over board.

647
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:40,188
Tirunelveli is receiving Tamarabarani
water after l take my bath in it.

648
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:42,422
Saamy, don't mistake me.

649
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:45,891
l'm a friendly type but if l
get angry, l'll not spare anybody.

650
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:48,656
All having Tata Sumos,
Qualis etc.,

651
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:51,391
Are you wondering why l'm
still using Ambassador?

652
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:54,397
Astrologer told me that if l lose
this car my life will be in danger.

653
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:57,539
Nagarajan of 75th ward is
troubling us using your name.

654
00:42:57,808 --> 00:43:00,971
Hey! Who's that rascal? Playing politics
without our knowledge!

655
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:02,345
Ask him to meet me...

656
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:04,914
l'll take care of him, you go.
- l'll get along.

657
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:08,408
He's the right man. He consults me

658
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:14,415
District Magistrate who's the Chief Guest
here on this lndependence day..

659
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:17,924
After you've come to Tirunelveli
crime rate has come down a lot.

660
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:21,091
Whatever help you want, tell me...

661
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:24,396
As a Judge, l'll definitely do the
needful. - Thank you sir.

662
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:29,095
l'll request the Deputy Commissioner
Arusaamy to give a speech.

663
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:33,535
l like Tirunelveli ''Halwa''.

664
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:35,438
Becareful, he might cheat you.

665
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:40,382
l like girls in this town
more than that.

666
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:42,948
Don't mistake me.

667
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:44,678
l like your courage...

668
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,783
ln this town, the way the
girls carry umbrellas,

669
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:50,626
l feel as if they're
carrying sickles.

670
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:56,625
Normally, men will trouble women.

671
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:59,962
He may be a thief or a rogue.
You shouldn't get scared of them.

672
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,965
l'm not asking you to carry
weapons for self protection.

673
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:03,465
Even chili powder in
your house will do.

674
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:06,640
l've the experience of being attacked
by the chili powder.

675
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:07,970
Hey! He's referring to you.

676
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:11,143
ln this town, when we went in search
of a house in civil dress, a girl...

677
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:16,486
A girl mistook us as thieves
and locked us inside a room.

678
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:17,988
She threw chili powder on us.

679
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:19,587
She's a student of
your college.

680
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:21,417
Who's she?

681
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:24,822
The girl wearing black
upper cloth...that girl.

682
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:26,826
lt's you only.

683
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:28,596
lt'll be better if you come on
the dais yourself.

684
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:34,829
He's calling you.
Go...go.

685
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:38,508
Bhuvana, please come to the stage.

686
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:42,675
On behalf of our Police Department,

your lips near my ears.

701
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:19,158

00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:30,236

He'll tie a swing under the
''Bodhi'' tree for the child.

lf Kattambomman falls in love, he'll
pluck flowers in a battle field.

You made me study love lessons before
my morning & evening studies

709
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:44,047

Saamy gave me the garland.
- What?

713
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:03,699
l mean a garland which was
offered to Saamy(God)

714
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,197
Oh, God's garland!

715
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:08,202
Then, keep it safely inside.
- Okay, Grandma.

Hail Motherland!
Hail Motherland!

l want them also to join us.
- They are from other caste.

00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:24,213
Colour difference must be
in the flag only.

721
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:25,718
Not in the hearts of people.

722
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:27,219
They belong to low caste, man.

723
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:30,393
You are calling them as others.
Who are they?

724
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:33,062
They laid these roads.
They built your houses.

725
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:36,061
They are the people who vote in
elections. They wash your clothes.

726
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:39,235
They hold breath and clean sewages,
diving into them.

727
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:41,063
Rice, Wheat & Flour,

728
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:42,738
They are the people
who produce them.

729
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:46,466
lf they are not here,
how'll we get food?

730
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:49,438
What's this, sir?

731
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:51,240
We were eagerly waiting for
chocolates. You spoiled that too.

732
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:54,417
Silly boy! l was arguing
for you only.

733
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:55,915
Today, it's our lndependence Day!

734
00:50:56,119 --> 00:51:00,078
On this day, you must know about
a great freedom fighter.

735
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:00,915
Look at this.

736
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:03,585
Did you see? Do you know him?

737
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:06,092
l know him. Police is searching
him, isn't it?

738
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:07,422
What are you saying boy?

739
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:09,758
He's the kidnapper who abducted
Rajkumar & Nagappa, isn't he?

740
00:51:09,966 --> 00:51:14,596
Just for the moustache, you've made
Poet Bharati into brigand Veerappan.

741
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:19,601
Bharati, are you closing your ears
with head gear not to hear this?

742
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:20,606
Greetings leader!

743
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:23,779
lt seems you've started a new party.
Admit me into your party.

744
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,607
Hey, when did l start a party?

745
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:28,944
You've hoisted a colourful flag.
You've gathered a crowd around you.

746
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:34,185
Can't you differentiate between National
flag & a Party flag, when you're drunk?

747
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:37,790
l'm your party's Propaganda Secretary.

748
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:39,788
That is P.S.!

749
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:43,227
You're not P.S. For me, you're
the murderer Godse.

750
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:46,198
They are from a very
poor family.

751
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:48,530
You must find the stolen jewellery
& return it to them.

752
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:51,866
You're saying 30 sovereigns
of gold and 40,000 cash.

753
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:54,873
Will you keep them in this ramshackle
bureau instead of bank?

754
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:58,214
You seem to be senseless people.
- Please, find it somehow.

755
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:00,883
You're asking us to find them,
as if we know where they're.

756
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:02,483
Can we visualize with
extra sensory perception?

757
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:04,477
Hey, tell me man!
Tell me your name.

758
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:05,387
Narayanan!

759
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:06,556
When did it happen?

760
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:08,485
l don't know!

761
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:12,220
Did you go to the temple with the
entire family leaving them at home?

762
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:21,233
Yes, Saamy!
- l'm Bhuvana speaking.

763
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:22,230
Which Bhuvana?

764
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:24,907
You know me and l know you.

765
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,840
Oh! Chili powder!
What's the matter?

766
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:34,307
Modus-operandi! - He had bent
window bars.

767
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:36,085
To open the bureau he had
used a crow bar.

768
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:38,751
We've informed finger print experts.
Police sniffer dogs are on the way.

769
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:44,593
Hello!

770
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:47,763

thieves who use crow bars.

Setta Muthu, Melapalayam Anwar,
Market Radha, Palayamkottai David...

Atthupalayam Buddhar and
Vallanadu Mottai, sir.

775
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:57,936
Trace out all of them and inform me.
- Okay sir.

776
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:02,275
Sir, they're my 35 years savings.

777
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:05,614

Sir, 5 are available.
Vallanadu Mottai is missing.

779
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:10,213
Find him!

780
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:14,347
l had saved the jewels
for her marriage.

781
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:16,288
lf we don't get them back,

782
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:18,623
Our entire family must
commit suicide.

783
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:20,360
Why are you crying?
Be brave.

784
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:22,794
Sir, Vallanadu Mottai has stolen them.

785
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:23,795
What are you saying, man?

786
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,628
He has informed B-2 Police lnspector
on phone about the theft.

787
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:29,304
lt's shameful!
Where's the accused now?

788
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:30,803
We've arrested him at
Kaitharu check post.

789
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,133
First bring those jewels
and cash immediately,

790
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:34,303
Or else a family will
commit suicide.

791
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:41,984
Make the date as 12.

792
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:44,911
Yes, Paramasivan. - Take it!

793
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:48,153
These are your jewels, aren't they?
Check them.

794
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:50,152
Sir! - What's this sir?

795
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,987
You're like my father, why are
you falling at my feet?

796
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:53,992
You're like God to
our family.

797
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:57,332
You take their statement. - Yes sir.
- You've saved our lives.

798
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:59,593
We'll be indebted to you all our lives.
- l'll get along.

799
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:05,674
You caught the thief by
investigating brilliantly.

800
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:08,343
l'm proud of you.
Reduce your girths,

801
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:10,410
Or else you won't be able to
see your own shoes also.

802
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:13,342
Didn't you get any
pirated VCD's?

803
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:14,517
You all are going to theatre,
aren't you?

804
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:17,016
Venkatrama, an injustice is going on
in this neighbourhood.

805
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,016
What's going on?

806
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:22,351
lt seems a policeman comes here
and finds a thief in one hour.

807
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,186
Are they stealing themselves
and returning,

808
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:27,192
Or is it a nexus between police
and thieves? l've a doubt.

809
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:29,024
lf they find, you'll accuse
them of a nexus.

810
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:30,529
lf they fail you'll accuse
them of incompetence.

811
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:32,702
People like you must be punched.

812
00:54:32,902 --> 00:54:33,869
You might defend
them vociferously.

813
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,197
But when a sniffer dog takes
a day to find a thief,

814
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:38,040
How can he find in one hour?

815
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:41,039
lf Police decides, not in
one hour,

816
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:44,042
They can arrest you this very
minute under POTA...

817
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:46,374
How's it possible? - They can arrest
if you possess any weapon.

818
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:47,880
l don't have any weapon
in my possession.

819
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:48,880
Here, you've one.

820
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:53,545
He's having a weapon. Arrest him.
- Are you talking Law? Come man.

821
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:56,385
Here they are arresting on receiving
just one complaint.

822
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,887
There, a brigand is releasing
audio cassettes in the forest,

823
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:00,062
Arranging a press meet.

824
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:02,731
When are you going to
arrest him?

825
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:14,100
Brother, Police have been informed.
Saamy is coming here.

826
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:15,711
Who's this Saamy?

827
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:17,539
lf 10 people join and
do it, it's a criminal act.

828
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:19,874
lf 100 people join & do it,
it's a violent communal clash.

829
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:21,880
What's going to happen now
is the communal clash.

830
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,222
Disperse peacefully from here
without disturbing people.

831
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:36,899
A man from our caste has been killed.
We'll not stop.

832
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,567
lnvestigation is progressing.

833
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,065
lt's unlawful to gather a crowd
without permission.

834
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:43,637
We've been born & brought up here,
whose permission do we've to take?

835
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,902
l'm warning you for the last time,
disperse immediately.

836
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:48,634
lf we don't, will you
baton charge us?

837
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:49,812
Will you stop us with brick bats,

838
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,571
Or disperse us using
tear gas shells?

839
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:56,343
Whatever it is, we are not
going to disperse.

840
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:05,192
Look, he's running away.

841
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:27,173
Saamy, are you a Policeman
or a rowdy?

842
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:32,853
l'm not a fool to get hacked by you
with a baton & brickbat.

843
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:38,727
l'm not an idiot policeman to wait for
Collector's order to fire below knees.

844
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:39,988
l'm Saamy.

845
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:42,798
Are you using bad words publicly?
- What will you do?

846
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:44,766
lf you kill us,
l'll also kill you.

847
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:47,128
Will you burn down a bus?
l'll burn you down!

848
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:48,895
lf you kill us, it's a murder.

849
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:50,897
lf l kill you,
it's an enquiry commission.

850
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:53,132
l know how to face that
enquiry commission.

851
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:57,243
lf you like to fight, go to Vallanadu
mountains, fight & die there.

852
00:56:57,447 --> 00:56:59,472
Why are you entering the town and
disturbing the peace?

853
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:01,741
Saamy, do you know against
whom you're going?

854
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,441
You're going against a
powerful caste.

855
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:11,324
You'll find all these
names in thousands.

856
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:15,829
One in 100 millions will be named as
Arusaamy. l'm one in 100 million.

857
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:18,926
lf you go against me, l'll exterminate
your entire group.

858
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:19,999
Be careful!

859
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:23,230
l'm not a Policeman but
a rogue.

860
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:29,444
Sir, you said something,
what does it mean?

861
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:33,707
Rotten egg and foolish monkey!
- Oh, doesn't it have a bad meaning?

862
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:35,441
Hold it tightly, don't loosen
the bedspread.

863
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:40,417
Bloody idiots!

864
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,454
Who used so much herbal medicine
for inhaling vapours,

865
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:45,727
As if it's to be given to a cattle?
- l used for immediate...

866
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:47,487
My life? - No, cold!

867
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:48,220
That's alright!

868
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:51,996
l'll add poison to the food you eat.
You'll reach heaven.

869
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:55,171
Annachi, today he had threatened
that caste.

870
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:56,599
ln future, he might go
against us also.

871
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:59,331
Hey, why are you getting
such crazy ideas?

872
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:01,340
Saamy is our man.

873
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:04,172
He'll never go against us.
You go...

874
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:10,178
Sir, let's shift the Police station
to the bus stand. - Why?

875
00:58:10,386 --> 00:58:13,617
We are always here.
- lt's peak hour!

876
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:16,522
Peak hour or girl hour! - Hey!

877
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:20,518
ln the morning, you're standing there
& in the evening you're here.

878
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,857
lt's sunny there in the morning
& sunny here in the evening.

879
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:25,091
Are you standing here for the Sun
or the girl?

880
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:29,534
Saamy is standing there.

881
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:33,872
Are you disappointed that he hasn't
turned to see you?

882
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:37,046
Shall l call him? ... Saamy!
- Hey, keep quiet!

883
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:49,321
Hello!

884
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:10,079
Bundle him into the jeep.

885
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:17,242
He's itching for trouble.
Take him away, bloody rogue.

886
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,078
lf l'm a little careless,
l think he'll kill me also.

887
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:27,091
l've curd rice & pickle
for lunch.

888
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,589
Why does a college going girl
need money for other than this.

889
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,773
Madam, DC told me to
give this to you.

890
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,134
Silence, what's this trouble
in front of a temple?

891
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:08,463
We've bought a new elephant
for our neighbourhood temple.

892
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:10,138
Did you buy it? Very good.

893
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:13,468
Are you going to make it
beg in the shops around here?

894
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:14,973
That isn't the problem.
- What's the problem?

895
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:18,477
There's a temple inside dedicated to
Lord Vishnu & Lord Shiva separately.

896
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:19,807
lt's a known fact!

897
01:00:20,016 --> 01:00:22,143
Do we've to mark the elephant
with Lord Vishnu's symbol,

898
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:23,819
r the sacred ash symbol of Lord Shiva, that's the probler

899
01:00:24,187 --> 01:00:25,779
Oh, have you started that problem?

900
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:27,853
Does the elephant know
about this problem?

901
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:32,050
How can it know, it's an animal?
- ls it the only animal here?

902
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:36,992
Silence! You're arguing about
Lord Vishnu's & Lord Shiva's symbols.

903
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,828
Did anyone of you think of
making it wear a shirt?

904
01:00:41,204 --> 01:00:42,501
You've seen film
''Kalikambal'', haven't you?

905
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:44,502
ln that film, the elephant
wears a shirt.

906
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:47,505
First tell us, whose side are you,
their's or our's?

907
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:49,769
Aunt, Lord Vishnu & Shiva
are one & the same.

908
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:52,341
Those who're ignorant of this are
useless. l believe in this thought.

909
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:56,348
So, l'm sporting a ''Rudraksh'' here &
Lord Vishnu's symbol on my forehead.

910
01:00:56,552 --> 01:00:57,712
Both are same to me.

911
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,514
l don't know whether you'll mark it
with Lord Vishnu's or Shiva's symbol.

912
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:05,023
lt's going to drop dung now.
First decide who's going to clean it.

913
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:06,960
You... you...

914
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:10,966
He's right hand and
left hand of my Annachi.

915
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:14,368
As the girl was chubby & beautiful,
he molested her.

916
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:17,401
Will you do it, if your
sisters are like that?

917
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,465
Take him away!

918
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:19,967
Don't stare at me after
committing the mistake.

919
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:20,972
Shall l go, Saamy?

920
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:24,811
Hey, Manickam, MLA is
taking him away!

921
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:26,576
Hey, look there.

922
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:33,349
Sir, we thought you were a good
and honest policeman.

923
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:34,987
You've released him.

924
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:36,154
Be patient.

925
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,657
How can l be patient?
He has molested my sister.

926
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:40,495
Can we do anything if we've money?

927
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:42,327
Have you finished?

928
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,392
Okay l'll arrest him now.

929
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:47,327
They'll transfer me from here,
l'm not bothered about it.

930
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:48,728
Another Officer will come.

931
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:50,337
He'll release him and arrest
you under Goondas Act.

932
01:01:50,573 --> 01:01:51,335
He'll foist a theft case
on your father.

933
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:53,939
He'll brand your sister as prostitute
and ruin your entire family.

934
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:56,509
So, do we've to endure all this?
- You've to.

935
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,013
You're waiting patiently in a queue
for kerosene in a ration shop,

936
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:01,672
And for tickets in a theatre.
How can you get instant justice?

937
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,515
lf the case goes to Court,

938
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:09,352
They'll put embarrassing questions
and kill that girl alive.

939
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:12,192
A secret between us will
become an open secret.

940
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,521
Then, isn't there any way
to get justice?

941
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,858
Putting such rogues in jail isn't
just punishment for them.

942
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:20,866
Against Law, we must stone him to death
or shoot him to death publicly.

943
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:24,539
Such a situation will come,
then l'll give you a sickle.

944
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:27,369
Till then, retain this anger on him.
- Sir, Annachi has called you.

945
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:31,504
Tell him, l'll come. - He has asked you
to come immediately, sir.

946
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:32,377
Rascal!

947
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:35,179
Bloody!

948
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:45,620
What do you think of me?

949
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,890
Am l your servant or
your broom?

950
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:50,895
He's calling me authoritatively
as if l'm his watchman.

951
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,229
l've self esteem & self respect. l'll not
give them up under any circumstances.

952
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:57,303
The money you pay me is fee
for the mistakes you commit.

953
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,575
lt's a price for not
doing my duty.

954
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:02,740
l'll respect only Perumal Pitchai.

955
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:05,243
l don't care for any other beggar
who begs from him.

956
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:09,077
lf you still do it, l'll pump bullets
into everyone of you here.

957
01:03:10,586 --> 01:03:12,315
King will kill on the same day.
God will kill leisurely,

958
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:15,049
And l'll kill without leaving
any evidence. Be careful.

959
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:17,957
Annachi, he's abusing us loudly and
you're watching.

960
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:21,821
He's definitely from our caste only.

961
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:25,495
When he was speaking in anger,
his ears turned red. Did you see?

962
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:28,101
He meant all of us and
you're talking about his caste.

963
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:30,272
l had told you to call him.

964
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:31,997
Did you cross the limits and
invited trouble here?

965
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:36,435
A Tiger will crouch to pounce
on the prey. Be careful.

966
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:39,180
Hey, stop the jeep.

967
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:41,846
Why is she standing here without
going to college?

968
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:45,612
Sir, where're you now?

969
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:46,846
l'm on my way to
Commissioner's office.

970
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:48,349
lsn't that chili powder
girl there..

971
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:49,422
Yes, so what?

972
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:51,752
She's standing at the bus stop for a
long time. Did you ask her to come?

973
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:53,087
Okay...l'm coming there immediately.

974
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:54,530
Then, Commissioner?

975
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:55,526
l'll meet him later.

976
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:57,199
That's it.

977
01:03:57,733 --> 01:03:59,360
When it comes to love
even God will falter.

978
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:02,195
Can Saamy stay away from faltering?
Start the jeep.

979
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:21,988
Why're you standing here?

980
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:23,158
l want to talk to you...

981
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:37,201
About what?

982
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:41,243
Why didn't you come for
the last 4 days?

983
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:44,169
l went to Madurai for
CM's programme, why?

984
01:04:46,949 --> 01:04:48,883
What happened?
Why're you crying?

985
01:04:50,686 --> 01:04:52,244
l feel lost without seeing you.

986
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:54,923
l feel like seeing
you every day.

987

Are you married?

Who's this girl?

1137
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:40,392

ls it the way to show your loyalty
towards the millions l paid you?

1142
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:01,578
Even the food that's sticking
in your hand.

1143
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:04,752
Was bought by the money
l gave you as alms.

1144
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:14,089
lf l don't like anyone l'll kill
him even if he's my sibling.

By staying with me, are you trying
to go against me?

where you were killed.

01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:46,623
Please listen to me.

1153
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:49,126
Wait...do you know what they had done?

1154
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:50,628
Without knowing the truth...

1155
01:17:51,099 --> 01:17:53,624
l thought you were a good man.
- Please listen to me.

1156
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:55,962
Leave me.

1157
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:57,972
Don't go away in haste.

1158
01:18:24,599 --> 01:18:25,725
Annachi, petrol bunk is opened.

1159
01:18:25,934 --> 01:18:28,562
Hey, is it a finance company
to open & close frequently?

1160
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:29,896
The insult which
we've faced, is history.

1161
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:31,902
The day he entered our house
we should've taught him a lesson.

1162
01:18:32,174 --> 01:18:33,766
What do you want me to do?
Tell me, Annachi....

1163
01:18:34,109 --> 01:18:36,737
As a woman got hurt,
he got angry.

1164
01:18:37,112 --> 01:18:39,080
We asked many times...
but, he didn't reply.even once...

1165
01:18:40,282 --> 01:18:41,579
Hey, forget about it.

1166
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:45,483
Hey, this news shouldn't be
published in evening's newspaper.

1167
01:18:52,627 --> 01:18:54,595
Bhuvana.... - Don't touch me.

1168
01:18:55,297 --> 01:18:56,924
Listen to me...
- What's left to say?

1169
01:18:57,132 --> 01:18:58,724
What happened was....
- lt's enough.

1170
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:02,099
The faith which l had on you is lost.

1171
01:19:02,637 --> 01:19:06,095
God won't forgive you
for deceiving a girl.

1172
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:07,605
Bhuvana, don't talk like a fool.

1173
01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:09,936
l'm a fool to have believed a cheat
who cheats the town.

1174
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:12,109
Today, you used your position
and took money.

1175
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:14,748
Tomorrow, what's the guarantee that
you won't sell me? - Hey, stop it...

1176
01:19:17,486 --> 01:19:19,147
l can just leave you & go away.

1177
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:21,421
But, you'll commit suicide
within a week.

1178
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:23,458
l can't bear that....

1179
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:26,055
Do you know why l took bribe?

1180
01:19:27,329 --> 01:19:29,957
Every police man's job
has become commercial.

1181
01:19:30,332 --> 01:19:33,301
But, l consider this uniform
as my honour.

1182
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:35,970
My father considered his
job as sacred.

1183
01:19:36,671 --> 01:19:39,970
Whichever caste or religion a person
may belong to, if mistake is committed,

1184
01:19:40,342 --> 01:19:43,311
Only police has the right to get it rectified.

1185
01:19:43,845 --> 01:19:46,814
That's why, l educated my son &
asked him to take up police job.

1186
01:19:47,015 --> 01:19:49,643
Then, will Saamy become
lnspector in our place?

1187
01:19:49,851 --> 01:19:51,409
Why're you asking like
a competitor?

1188
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:54,822
lf my son gets a job....He'll become
an officer, in this place.

1189
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:01,818
Saamy, you've got an interview card.

Son, to get something
we've to lose something.

01:26:11,432 --> 01:26:15,892
30 years ago, l exercised & conditioned
my body to become a policeman.

1240
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:19,300
As my father was unable
to give a mere Rs.8000,

1241
01:26:19,707 --> 01:26:21,140
l was unable to get
that job.

1242
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:25,407
On the first day when
l worked in the fields.

1243
01:26:25,613 --> 01:26:28,081
l can't express the anguish
which l went through.

1244
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:30,315
You shouldn't face
similar situation.

You should get that job.

But it's feed back was....
Politicians problems...

among higher officials.

01:26:39,794 --> 01:26:40,761
l got transferred frequently.

1250
01:26:41,629 --> 01:26:43,256

me to Trichy.

Or else, l've to do my duty.

Can you be in politics without rowdism?
You can't, isn't it?

1263
01:28:22,563 --> 01:28:25,691
Then, why've you arrested him?

Transfer, won't be enough.

1278
01:29:00,535 --> 01:29:02,162
Like branding the cows coming for sale,

1279
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:04,497
We should
confine him to his house, without hitting him.

1280
01:29:05,206 --> 01:29:08,733
We should teach him that politicians
are born criminals.

1281

We're from vigilance department.

1282

First stop distributing
the invitations.

1291
01:29:43,111 --> 01:29:44,738
This marriage won't be performed
- What do you mean?

1292
01:29:44,946 --> 01:29:48,746
Your son has been arrested for
taking bribe in a prostitution case.

No. This marriage won't be performed.
You stop this marriage.

1298
01:30:10,972 --> 01:30:12,098
Do you also believe it?

1299
01:30:13,975 --> 01:30:16,500
l won't believe even if
Lord Muruga comes & says.

1300
01:30:17,812 --> 01:30:19,609
You won't do a wrong thing.

1301
01:30:20,148 --> 01:30:25,780
Our village people say that you
want to multiply 7 lakhs into 70 lakhs.

1302

Let them talk.

1303
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:30,448
This's the punishment
for being honest.

1304
01:30:30,992 --> 01:30:32,289
Justice & law are dead.

1305
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:34,959
What did law do to you,
for being honest?

1306
01:30:35,496 --> 01:30:37,191
lt suspended you & made you
to stay in the house.

1307
01:30:37,498 --> 01:30:40,126
Being brave is not enough,
you should be intelligent also.

1308
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:42,963
Without taking bribe....
They accused you of taking bribe.

1309
01:30:43,337 --> 01:30:44,861
Hereafter, you take bribe
& do good things.

1310
01:30:45,173 --> 01:30:46,640
You create a law for yourself.

1311
01:30:47,775 --> 01:30:49,402
There may be 100's of
bad people in a place.

1312
01:30:49,677 --> 01:30:50,302
Forget about them.

1313
01:30:50,812 --> 01:30:52,575
ln the same place there may
be four good people.

1314
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:54,008
You do good to them.

1315
01:30:54,816 --> 01:30:56,807
ln Epic Ramayanam, if Vali was
a good person.

1316

facing him.

01:30:58,686 --> 01:31:01,348
Since he was a bad persons
be hit him from behind.

1318
01:31:01,556 --> 01:31:03,114
According to the rules of
the war, it's a sin.

1319
01:31:03,524 --> 01:31:05,788
But, according to human law
it's right.

1320
01:31:06,627 --> 01:31:10,324
Saamy, l had lost 5 children
before you were born...

1321
01:31:10,765 --> 01:31:14,292
You're my 6th child. That's why
l named you Arusaamy.(Six Swamy)

1322
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:20,164
You were born after
killing five children.

1323
01:31:20,441 --> 01:31:22,500
You do anything for good things.

1324
01:31:22,844 --> 01:31:24,243
You kill anyone.

1325
01:31:25,713 --> 01:31:29,205
Nothing wrong in that.
There's no sin in that.

1326
01:31:32,587 --> 01:31:37,490
l struggled for six months to prove
myself innocent in the court.

1327
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:40,787
We can find Politicians & rich men
in all the places.

1328
01:31:41,229 --> 01:31:42,321
l can't reform all of them.

1329
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:45,124
That's why, as my father had said,
l changed myself.

1330
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,968
Or else, l wouldn't have stayed for
such a long time in this place.

1331
01:31:48,703 --> 01:31:51,297
Bhuvana, l didn't take bribe
from the public.

1332
01:31:51,906 --> 01:31:54,636
l took bribe from the evil persons
who deceive the Government.

1333
01:31:55,376 --> 01:31:58,368
Bribe, which l'm taking is like
offerings to God.

1334
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:02,108
lt'll go to temple's trust
but not to God.

1335
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:04,048
Believe me.

1336
01:32:10,424 --> 01:32:12,790
Hey, what's our caste & tradition.

1337
01:32:12,994 --> 01:32:14,359
We don't know who's he...

1338
01:32:14,562 --> 01:32:16,086
You've done such a mistake.

1339
01:32:16,297 --> 01:32:17,525
Mother, he's a good person.

1340
01:32:17,765 --> 01:32:20,962
What's your age? Why do
you think like this?

1341
01:32:21,235 --> 01:32:24,693
You call & talk to him... - Shut up.
That's why l wanted you,

1342
01:32:24,906 --> 01:32:27,898
to check whether your daughter is going
to college or somewhere else. - Silence.

1343
01:32:28,709 --> 01:32:29,641
At this vulnerable age of falling in love,

1344
01:32:29,844 --> 01:32:31,277
lt's your mistake to send her
to college.

1345
01:32:31,479 --> 01:32:33,879
Now, who'll take the responsibility?

1346
01:32:34,081 --> 01:32:36,641
You call & talk to him.
- What to talk?

1347
01:32:36,851 --> 01:32:38,250
At teenage, while she is going
to college,

1348
01:32:38,452 --> 01:32:41,250
lf you wish to marry her,
then, the family will be in problem.

1349
01:32:41,455 --> 01:32:43,423
Will you please shut up?

1350
01:32:45,126 --> 01:32:49,085
Look, she won't be reformed by
pouring water on her.

1351
01:32:49,297 --> 01:32:53,028
You call that boy & talk to him.
That'll be better.

1352
01:32:55,603 --> 01:32:56,763
You take coffee.

1353
01:32:58,673 --> 01:33:00,197
To dissolve the sugar you mix the coffee well.
Tumble the coffee well.

1354
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:02,069
Only then, sugar will be dissolved.

1355
01:33:03,611 --> 01:33:05,772
lt may be Hot...Cool it
and drink.

1356
01:33:10,618 --> 01:33:12,984
Don't sip...Pour it in
your mouth.

1357
01:33:14,055 --> 01:33:16,922
They're giving such elaborate instructions
for drinking coffee. Very funny!

1358
01:33:17,792 --> 01:33:23,025
We can't even imagine that our
girl loves a police officer.

1359
01:33:23,230 --> 01:33:26,097
Grandma, it's wrong to love a thief.

1360
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:27,824
We're different from you.

1361
01:33:28,135 --> 01:33:30,501
With what faith can we marry
our daughter to you?

1362
01:33:30,738 --> 01:33:33,798
Apart from being a good husband
and a good son-in-law,

1363
01:33:33,908 --> 01:33:36,077
l'll be your son...You believe my words &
get your daughter married to me.

1364
01:33:36,077 --> 01:33:38,910
She's a very young girl. Not even
finished her college.

1365
01:33:39,113 --> 01:33:40,944
Before that, how can we
perform her marriage?

1366
01:33:41,148 --> 01:33:45,050
Don't worry, l'll treat your daughter
as a child. l'll keep her happy.

1367
01:33:45,319 --> 01:33:49,187
lf we accept your proposal
how much dowry will you expect?

1368
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:51,153
You give me one sovereign
of gold & Re.1 .

1369
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:54,260
Rs.1 ...What's this?
He's asking like CM's salary.

1370
01:33:54,462 --> 01:33:57,363
Sir, do you consider us
beggars? - That's it.

1371
01:33:57,565 --> 01:33:59,863
My sons's monthly salary
is Rs.7000.

1372
01:34:00,067 --> 01:34:03,503
Our women earn Rs.10,000
monthly by packing spices.

1373
01:34:03,704 --> 01:34:05,695
Our son-in-law. - Why do you talk
about all that now? Forget it.

1374
01:34:05,906 --> 01:34:07,806
Let's talk about other things.
- Okay, let's forget it.

1375
01:34:08,009 --> 01:34:11,968
We'll offer you generously...
You ask unhesitatingly.

1376
01:34:12,179 --> 01:34:14,670
Then, you give one lakh &
100 sovereigns of Gold.

1377
01:34:14,882 --> 01:34:16,907
What's this? You're asking
in PM's range.

1378
01:34:17,418 --> 01:34:20,945
l don't want anything. You give me only
your daughter. That's enough.

1379
01:34:21,155 --> 01:34:23,146
l'm living for Bhuvana.

1380
01:34:23,357 --> 01:34:26,121
Till l'm alive, l want to
live for Bhuvana.

1381
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,925
Bless me.

1382
01:34:28,129 --> 01:34:28,652
Hubby...

1383
01:34:29,764 --> 01:34:30,662
May you long live.

1384
01:34:32,266 --> 01:34:36,600
First son-in-law is a priest
& 2nd one is a policeman.

1385
01:34:36,837 --> 01:34:37,496
Grandpa...

1386
01:34:37,705 --> 01:34:40,674
What's it? Hubby...
- We like you very much.

1387
01:34:41,642 --> 01:34:42,904
l don't like this.

1388
01:34:48,049 --> 01:34:50,415
Your face shows that you're not happy.

1389
01:34:51,285 --> 01:34:53,412
Sir, l'll wait till you believe me
comprehensively.

1390
01:34:53,621 --> 01:34:56,419
Sir, you seem to be a good person.

1391
01:34:57,024 --> 01:35:00,016
But, l've about 400 relatives
in `Ambasamudhiram'.

1392
01:35:00,227 --> 01:35:02,388
l don't know what to
tell them. - Uncle.

1393
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:05,097
You forget about 400 persons.
You select a good person.

1394
01:35:05,299 --> 01:35:08,860
Srinivasa, if l had a son & sought your
daughter's alliance, won't You accept?

1395
01:35:09,070 --> 01:35:11,766
l'm considering him as my son &
asking your daughter's hand.

1396
01:35:12,873 --> 01:35:16,070
That day, when l fell at your feet
you said, ''l'm like your father.''

1397
01:35:16,277 --> 01:35:18,108
l don't know what you meant by that.

1398
01:35:18,312 --> 01:35:21,110
But, l consider you as my son.

1399
01:35:23,150 --> 01:35:26,881
Why're you still thinking?
Say `yes'. - Okay.

1400
01:35:28,055 --> 01:35:31,024
ln the year of `Chitra Banu'
on Jan 4th...

1401
01:35:31,258 --> 01:35:35,126
Palani Sriram Chokka Lingam's son
Saamy(alias) Arusaamy.

Now, my dreams are coming true...

But, l've become your partner.

1409

The days which l count for the
marriage, are a pleasant burden...

1410
01:36:35,523 --> 01:36:40,085
Without separating the lips &
without raising the voice.

1411
01:36:40,294 --> 01:36:45,197
l'll sing a song for myself.

1412
01:37:04,552 --> 01:37:29,071
<i>TAMlLlNl</i>

1413
01:37:29,410 --> 01:37:38,842
Hereafter, the drama which we'll
play in the house will be pleasant.

1414
01:37:39,053 --> 01:37:47,518
Your eyes will search
me every where.

1415
01:37:48,062 --> 01:37:50,189
You'll find me near the stair case.

1416
01:37:50,397 --> 01:37:52,695
You'll act as though,
you haven't seen me.

1417
01:37:53,167 --> 01:37:55,135
You'll embrace me.

1418
01:37:55,336 --> 01:37:57,702
You'll hug me in the
middle of the stair case.

1419
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:02,539
Fear will beget fear &
it'll vanish.

1420
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:06,710
Shyness will feel shy &
vanish.

1421
01:39:22,323 --> 01:39:31,459
You'll prepare lunch by yourself
on Sunday afternoons.

1422
01:39:31,832 --> 01:39:40,467
You'll ask me to watch
the fun & wash my clothes.

1423
01:39:40,841 --> 01:39:43,139
The entire town is afraid of you.

1424
01:39:43,344 --> 01:39:45,642
But, you behave like a child with me.

1425
01:39:46,013 --> 01:39:47,981
l'll feel proud of me.

1426
01:39:48,182 --> 01:39:50,480
We both are made for each other!

1427
01:39:51,185 --> 01:39:54,985
My heart is drenched with happiness.

1428
01:39:55,356 --> 01:39:59,486
My world will blossom.

1429
01:40:49,576 --> 01:40:51,373
There's no inter-caste anomaly.

1430
01:40:51,578 --> 01:40:53,375
There's no inter-caste anomaly.

1431
01:40:53,747 --> 01:40:55,715
Sir, read `Konar Tamil'.

1432
01:40:55,916 --> 01:40:56,883
l ate at `Devar's mess.

1433
01:40:57,084 --> 01:40:58,051
l had tea in a `Nair's shop'.

1434
01:40:58,252 --> 01:40:59,378
l bought provisions
from Nadar's shop.

1435
01:40:59,586 --> 01:41:00,883
l borrowed money from
chettiar's house.

1436
01:41:01,088 --> 01:41:03,113
Sir, how can we believe that
there's no caste system .

1437
01:41:04,258 --> 01:41:05,987
Wow, he has put me in a fix.

1438
01:41:06,193 --> 01:41:07,888
Sir...Greetings sir...

1439
01:41:08,095 --> 01:41:08,720
What do you want, man?

1440
01:41:08,929 --> 01:41:12,330
My son is a good student.
but they aren't admitting him in the school.

1441
01:41:12,599 --> 01:41:13,896
Aren't they?

1442
01:41:14,268 --> 01:41:15,895
Sir, greetings... - Greetings.

1443
01:41:16,103 --> 01:41:18,071
This boy is from a poor family
but studies well.

1444
01:41:18,272 --> 01:41:19,068
Give him a seat.

1445
01:41:19,273 --> 01:41:21,070
l can't give him admission in
a convent school. - Why?

1446
01:41:21,275 --> 01:41:22,173
His parents are uneducated.

1447
01:41:22,376 --> 01:41:24,469
Then, do one thing.
First give admission to the parents.

1448
01:41:24,711 --> 01:41:26,906
Let them obtain their degrees.
Then admit him.

1449
01:41:27,114 --> 01:41:28,741
Priest what're you blabbering?

1450
01:41:28,949 --> 01:41:29,574
l'm not blabbering, this child
is going to study.

1451
01:41:29,783 --> 01:41:31,080
His parent's age is around 40.

1452
01:41:31,285 --> 01:41:32,343
How will they study now?

1453
01:41:32,553 --> 01:41:34,680
lf parents are educated, only then
they can teach their children.

1454
01:41:34,888 --> 01:41:38,085
Then, why're you here working as
a teacher? - Come here.

1455
01:41:38,292 --> 01:41:40,419
What's it? - Here, you've to give
donation to get admission.

1456
01:41:40,627 --> 01:41:42,595
Okay, you get it from
those who have.

1457
01:41:42,796 --> 01:41:45,264
He's poor, but he studies well...
Give him a seat.

1458
01:41:45,466 --> 01:41:46,933
What is he going to
do after studying?

1459
01:41:47,468 --> 01:41:49,936
Children's education will uplift lndia.

1460
01:41:50,137 --> 01:41:52,367
So said by Dr.Abdul Kalam whose
photo you've hung on the wall.

1461
01:41:52,573 --> 01:41:54,438
And you're refusing to give education
to a poor student.

1462
01:41:54,641 --> 01:41:55,608
ls it not injustice?

1463
01:41:55,809 --> 01:41:58,334
They all belongs to
cloth less caste.

1464
01:41:58,745 --> 01:42:01,612
So, clothes is the criteria, isn't it?.
- Yes.

1465
01:42:01,815 --> 01:42:03,442
l'll solve it now itself.

1466
01:42:09,156 --> 01:42:10,623
Hands up, boy...

1467
01:42:10,824 --> 01:42:12,291
Why does a chair need a cloth?

1468
01:42:12,493 --> 01:42:14,222
You need a shirt.

1469
01:42:15,996 --> 01:42:17,964
He has a shirt.
Give him a seat now.

1470
01:42:18,165 --> 01:42:20,963
ls shirt alone enough?
- Then, do you want pant also?

1471
01:42:21,168 --> 01:42:23,636
ls this okay for a pant?
- Oh God...l'll give him a seat.

1472
01:42:25,339 --> 01:42:25,805
Take him.

1473
01:42:26,173 --> 01:42:28,141
Sir, did my son get admission?

1474
01:42:28,342 --> 01:42:30,310
He got a seat & shirt also.

1475
01:42:30,511 --> 01:42:31,637
How did you wangle it?

1476
01:42:32,513 --> 01:42:33,912
l told the truth.

1477
01:42:35,516 --> 01:42:37,313
On January 12th,

1478
01:42:37,518 --> 01:42:40,817
The opposition party badmouthed
the ruling party leader.

1479
01:42:41,021 --> 01:42:44,980
So, the ruling party has decided to go
for one day's strike in the city.

1480
01:42:45,192 --> 01:42:50,824
Hey, it's a bandh of our party.
No one should come out.

1481
01:42:51,198 --> 01:42:53,325
Even tea or petty shops
shouldn't open.

1482
01:42:53,534 --> 01:42:55,832
lnform our henchmen in
all the areas. - Yes boss.

1483
01:42:56,203 --> 01:42:58,330
Sir, if there's bandh before `Pongal' fetival?
How will it be?

1484
01:42:58,872 --> 01:43:01,170
lt's a bandh called by the ruling party
so, close all your shops.

1485
01:43:01,375 --> 01:43:03,843
Government is not supporting it.
lt's ruling party's Bandh.

1486
01:43:04,044 --> 01:43:06,672
These are all perishable goods
we can't store them.

1487
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:10,839
We've bought goods
on high interest rates.

1488
01:43:11,051 --> 01:43:12,348
Sir, if you insist like this
what can we do?

1489
01:43:12,886 --> 01:43:15,514
lf we close our shops,
business will suffer a great loss.

1490
01:43:15,722 --> 01:43:18,691
Okay, you all sign on a paper
demanding protection.

1491
01:43:18,892 --> 01:43:20,860
l'll see to rest of the things.
- Thank you very much, sir.

1492
01:43:22,563 --> 01:43:24,793
Sir Annachi is involved
in this affair.

1493
01:43:25,065 --> 01:43:26,191
Do we've to interfere in this?

1494
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:29,528
All hard workers are
suffering a lot.

1495
01:43:29,903 --> 01:43:31,200
Forget about that man...

1496
01:43:38,579 --> 01:43:40,206
Sir, who's on duty in Palayamkottai?
- Kumarasamy.

1497
01:43:40,414 --> 01:43:42,211
Whoever creates problem,
put him in jail. - Okay sir.

1498
01:43:48,589 --> 01:43:50,887
We learnt about today's Bandh
only from the newspaper.

1499
01:43:56,263 --> 01:43:58,891
Sir, as you had said, l've given
security to the entire state.

1500
01:43:59,099 --> 01:44:00,726
Not only here, there won't be
any problem at any place.

1501
01:44:08,775 --> 01:44:11,073
Police chases & beats the rowdies.

1502
01:44:11,278 --> 01:44:13,746
Till Saamy sir is there,
l can bravely open the shop.

1503
01:44:23,123 --> 01:44:24,920
Thank you, sir... Long live, sir...

1504
01:44:42,909 --> 01:44:46,606
Hello, who's it? Annachi has gone out.

1505
01:44:47,147 --> 01:44:48,774
Put down your phone..

1506
01:44:49,149 --> 01:44:51,549
Saamy is not a human being.
Truly, he's a God.

1507
01:44:51,752 --> 01:44:52,514
Very good, Paramasivam...

1508
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:54,448
You're protecting the Public
against ruling Party's bandh.

1509
01:44:54,655 --> 01:44:55,622
Whether it's ruling
or opposition Party.

1510
01:44:55,822 --> 01:44:56,789
l'll give importance to the Public.

1511
01:44:57,157 --> 01:44:59,455
lf he wasn't there, we couldn't
have run the business.

1512
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:02,629
They've won & we've lost.

1513
01:45:02,829 --> 01:45:05,389
Bandh announced by ruling Party
passed off peacefully.

1514
01:45:05,832 --> 01:45:08,960
Except in Tirunelveli, there was no
disturbance in daily routines.

1515
01:45:09,169 --> 01:45:12,730
All the shops were open.
There were no untoward incidents.

1516
01:45:12,939 --> 01:45:14,634
Start the car.

1517
01:45:14,841 --> 01:45:17,469
Annachi, don't be in a hurry.
Everything is over.

1518
01:45:17,678 --> 01:45:18,474
Now, if you hit him...

1519
01:45:18,679 --> 01:45:20,306
He's a cheat. l didn't refer to him.

1520
01:45:21,181 --> 01:45:24,480
How dare businessmen
open their shops?

1521
01:45:24,685 --> 01:45:26,482
lt's all because of
that Saamy's support.

1522
01:45:26,687 --> 01:45:28,985
They know what'll happen if
they act against Annachi.

1523
01:45:29,189 --> 01:45:31,657
Annachi, coming Friday,
Saamy is going to get married.

1524
01:45:32,025 --> 01:45:34,152
At that time, all Police men will
be in the marriage hall.

1525
01:45:34,528 --> 01:45:36,996
On that day, let's show the
businessmen our true colour.

1526
01:45:37,197 --> 01:45:39,165
Their corpses should be
telecast in the T.V.

1527
01:45:40,367 --> 01:45:42,164
On Bogi festival, people burn all the rubbish,

1528
01:45:42,369 --> 01:45:46,169
And create pollution generating
Carbon-monoxide & dioxide.

1529
01:45:46,373 --> 01:45:48,841
People have already created a hole
in the Ozone layer.

1530
01:45:49,042 --> 01:45:51,010
Don't know where they are going
to create more holes.

1531
01:45:51,378 --> 01:45:53,346
Aunt, stop.

1532
01:45:53,714 --> 01:45:55,181
lt seems Uncle sleeps on this mat.

1533
01:45:55,382 --> 01:45:56,508
Are you going to put it in the fire?

1534
01:45:56,717 --> 01:45:58,116
lt has become old.
- Do you mean Uncle?

1535
01:45:58,385 --> 01:45:58,851
Shut up!

1536
01:45:59,052 --> 01:46:01,850
lf you give it to people who don't
have mat, they can sleep on it. Give it to me.

1537
01:46:02,089 --> 01:46:04,057
Shut up & get lost.

1538
01:46:04,224 --> 01:46:06,692
Uncle, please stop. What're you
putting in the fire.

1539
01:46:06,893 --> 01:46:07,689
Old clothes.

1540
01:46:07,894 --> 01:46:09,953
They may be old for you,
but they're new for them.

1541
01:46:10,163 --> 01:46:12,688
lf you give them they'll wear them.
- lt's good to burn old things.

1542
01:46:13,066 --> 01:46:15,534
The proverb says ''Discard old things &
accept the new ones''.

1543
01:46:16,002 --> 01:46:17,196
That is what Bogi festival is for, isn't it?

1544
01:46:18,405 --> 01:46:21,636
So, anything which is old can
be put in the fire, isn't it? - Sure.

1545
01:46:25,912 --> 01:46:27,209
Hey, what're you doing?

1546
01:46:27,414 --> 01:46:29,882
This is the oldest thing
in the entire District.

1547
01:46:30,083 --> 01:46:31,710
l'm going to put this in the fire.

1548
01:46:32,085 --> 01:46:33,552
And enjoy Bogi festival.

1549
01:46:34,755 --> 01:46:36,723
Hey, don't harm him. - Why?

1550
01:46:36,923 --> 01:46:37,719
He's my brother.

1551
01:46:37,924 --> 01:46:39,653
Let him be your brother or anyone.

1552
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:41,885
First keep the clothes down.

1553
01:46:42,262 --> 01:46:44,890
Only then, l won't put him
in the fire. - Get lost.

1554
01:46:45,265 --> 01:46:46,027
Children, take the clothes.

1555
01:46:48,602 --> 01:46:51,730
Thanks Uncle.
- l used you for a good cause.

1556
01:46:52,105 --> 01:46:54,164
Don't be afraid. l won't put you
in the fire.

1557
01:46:54,374 --> 01:46:58,071
Come. Let's go to your house &
have a cup of coffee. come..

1558
01:46:58,712 --> 01:46:59,736
Open your eyes.

1559
01:47:02,282 --> 01:47:05,843
Hey, it's been 2 days since he died.

1560
01:47:06,052 --> 01:47:08,680
And you're celebrating
Bogi festival!

1561
01:47:09,055 --> 01:47:10,750
You shouldn't celebrate
even Pongal festival which comes later..

1562
01:47:17,130 --> 01:47:17,755
Stop it!

1563
01:47:18,131 --> 01:47:20,031
How long will you be playing
the same music?

1564
01:47:20,233 --> 01:47:23,259
Beat the drum in the modern trend.

1565
01:47:26,473 --> 01:47:29,704
Come.. come.. You must eat & go.

1566
01:47:29,910 --> 01:47:30,774
My stomach is upset.

1567
01:47:30,977 --> 01:47:33,275
Then, eat & discard your waste
in a corner.

1568
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:35,778
Stupid! Doesn't know what to
talk in a marriage.

1569
01:47:47,994 --> 01:47:49,621
Hey, leave me... leave me..

1570
01:48:01,842 --> 01:48:03,639
Hey, why're you doing like this?

1571
01:48:03,844 --> 01:48:05,471
How dare you defy our boss &
open the shop?

1572
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:41,047
Beat the drum.

1573
01:48:46,753 --> 01:48:49,881
Sir.. sir..

1574
01:48:50,257 --> 01:48:53,556
Annachi's henchmen are destroying shops
in the market. - You sit down.

1575
01:48:53,927 --> 01:48:55,792
They've killed the shopkeepers.

1576
01:48:55,996 --> 01:48:58,726
Not only that, they've hacked
4 policemen too.

1577
01:48:58,932 --> 01:49:01,560
They're hitting women & children too.

1578
01:49:01,768 --> 01:49:03,133
Come & see there. - Come.

1579
01:49:07,941 --> 01:49:09,408
Sir... sir... Did you see this?

1580
01:49:09,609 --> 01:49:11,668
We've lost all our goods.

1581
01:49:11,878 --> 01:49:14,438
Look, they've killed our men.

1582
01:49:20,453 --> 01:49:23,251
Sir, we opened our shops because you
told us to open them.

1583
01:49:23,623 --> 01:49:25,921
Look, what Annachi's men have
done to us?

1584
01:49:26,726 --> 01:49:29,422
Look there, they've destroyed
all the shops.

1585
01:49:32,065 --> 01:49:35,592
He was in the market.
They killed him & went away.

1586
01:49:35,802 --> 01:49:38,100
l don't know what to do.
l'm clueless.

1587
01:49:38,305 --> 01:49:43,607
Did you see? Look how brutal they are.

1588
01:49:45,478 --> 01:49:48,447
We opened our shops because
you told us to open them.

1589
01:49:48,815 --> 01:49:51,113
Scoundrels, they've killed our men.

1590
01:49:51,651 --> 01:49:56,281
Look at this brutality!
What crime have we committed?

1591
01:49:57,157 --> 01:49:59,284
Why should we suffer like this?

1592
01:49:59,492 --> 01:50:02,290
Stop madam.. stop..

1593
01:50:03,663 --> 01:50:04,721
Look at this brutality.

1594
01:50:05,332 --> 01:50:06,799
They all opened the shops because we
told them to open.

1595
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,297
What should we do with Annachi?

1596
01:50:08,501 --> 01:50:09,798
What're we going to do for them?

1597
01:50:25,185 --> 01:50:25,810
Stop sir.

1598
01:50:29,122 --> 01:50:30,487
Come Saamy.

1599
01:50:30,857 --> 01:50:33,826
Have you come to get my blessings
after marriage.

1600
01:50:34,527 --> 01:50:35,824
Where's your wife?

1601
01:50:36,363 --> 01:50:36,988
Hey stop!

1602
01:50:37,197 --> 01:50:39,995
Hey, do you know the value of life?

1603
01:50:40,867 --> 01:50:43,768
Since your name is Saamy(God), did you
think you're God of this City?

1604
01:50:45,271 --> 01:50:47,831
Who permitted you to give them
Police protection?

1605
01:50:48,041 --> 01:50:49,838
Whom do l have to ask?
- You must ask me.

1606
01:50:50,043 --> 01:50:51,305
Are you the Collector or
the Government?

1607
01:50:51,511 --> 01:50:52,671
l'm more than that.

1608
01:50:53,713 --> 01:50:59,515
With Rs.13,000 salary, 2 sets
of uniforms & a pair of shoes,

1609
01:50:59,886 --> 01:51:02,855
Controlling 4 police stations
& 40 police men,

1610
01:51:03,056 --> 01:51:05,854
You've so much of arrogance?

1611
01:51:06,393 --> 01:51:10,193
l control 8 districts,
92 MLA's & 16 MP's,

1612
01:51:10,397 --> 01:51:15,198
And l control the Government.
How arrogant l should be?

1613
01:51:15,402 --> 01:51:18,701
Hey, l read 20 Newspapers a day.

1614
01:51:19,072 --> 01:51:21,540
Do you think it's easy to
indulge in Politics?

1615
01:51:21,741 --> 01:51:26,041
My high command is continuously
seeking information about the strike.

1616
01:51:26,246 --> 01:51:27,713
Will you answer them?

1617
01:51:29,582 --> 01:51:32,710
l don't have any value
for lives.

1618
01:51:32,919 --> 01:51:37,720
You made me lose my honour.
So, l took revenge.

1619
01:51:39,259 --> 01:51:40,055
lf you wanted to take revenge,

1620
01:51:40,260 --> 01:51:41,955
You must've fought with me for
giving them protection.

1621
01:51:42,929 --> 01:51:45,056
But you've killed innocent
businessmen.

1622
01:51:45,265 --> 01:51:47,733
You've broken the heads of women
& children too.

1623
01:51:47,934 --> 01:51:49,902
2 Policemen have died.
Who'll answer their families?

1624
01:51:50,670 --> 01:51:53,002
You people get salaries to die.

1625
01:51:53,206 --> 01:51:56,232
You're proud that you're part of
the fighting force, aren't you?

1626
01:51:56,609 --> 01:51:57,906
You must die when it
comes to fight.

1627
01:51:58,111 --> 01:52:01,239
Hey, we'll compensate for the
lost lives & damaged shops.

1628
01:52:01,448 --> 01:52:03,746
You Police dogs will wag your tail
if we give you bribes,

1629
01:52:03,950 --> 01:52:05,076
Or else you'll bark at us.

1630
01:52:05,285 --> 01:52:08,743
l don't bark, l bite!

1631
01:52:09,622 --> 01:52:12,750
l would've cut your throat on the day you
entered my house without permission.

1632
01:52:13,626 --> 01:52:16,925
l spared you because it could've
ruined a girl's life. Shit!

1633
01:52:17,697 --> 01:52:19,426
Since l didn't want the public
to be agitated,

1634
01:52:19,632 --> 01:52:21,429
l accepted money from you.

1635
01:52:21,634 --> 01:52:22,601
But now they're agitated.

1636
01:52:23,470 --> 01:52:25,097
You've showed your arrogance.

1637
01:52:25,638 --> 01:52:27,606
From now on, l'll show how
arrogant l can be.

1638
01:52:27,974 --> 01:52:28,599
What did you say?

1639
01:52:29,142 --> 01:52:32,942
l'll destroy your 92 MLA's,16 MP's,
4 Ministers, 40 Cars, 30 Jeeps,

1640
01:52:33,146 --> 01:52:34,443
And your title, Kingmaker.

1641
01:52:34,647 --> 01:52:37,775
lf l don't make you a beggar
& make you beg on the streets,

1642
01:52:39,652 --> 01:52:41,449
l'll change my name.

1643
01:52:41,988 --> 01:52:43,455
Only if l leave you till then...

1644
01:52:44,324 --> 01:52:45,120
Take it.

1645
01:52:45,992 --> 01:52:46,788
Transfer order!

1646
01:52:47,327 --> 01:52:49,295
Keep this as my gift for
your marriage.

1647
01:52:50,663 --> 01:52:52,631
You've to shift to another
City in 7 days.

1648
01:52:52,832 --> 01:52:54,800
Go & pack your luggage.

1649
01:52:59,172 --> 01:53:01,140
l can kill you
this second itself.

1650
01:53:02,842 --> 01:53:07,643
l'll kill you & perform your obsequies
within a week's time which you've given me.

1651
01:53:11,017 --> 01:53:12,314
Hey, Perumal Pitchai!

1652
01:53:13,353 --> 01:53:17,483
On the 7th day when l leave this City,
You'll not be in this City.

1653
01:53:27,033 --> 01:53:27,499
Thank God!

1654
01:53:31,371 --> 01:53:34,499
What happened? There wasn't any
problem, isn't it? - No dad.

1655
01:53:38,545 --> 01:53:39,512
Go inside.

1656
01:53:41,381 --> 01:53:44,407
Are you angry with me?
- No, my time isn't good,

1657
01:53:45,385 --> 01:53:46,682
That's why such things are
happening to you.

1658
01:53:46,886 --> 01:53:47,853
No, you mad girl.

1659
01:53:49,055 --> 01:53:51,853
All these days, l was feeling bad
for accepting money from a rogue.

1660
01:53:53,059 --> 01:53:55,687
The moment you came, into my life,
everything is coming to an end.

1661
01:54:00,233 --> 01:54:04,192
Venkatrama... - Yes.
- Come here.

1662
01:54:04,404 --> 01:54:05,371
No Uncle, l've some work
in this house.

1663
01:54:05,572 --> 01:54:07,039
Just come & have some water.

1664
01:54:07,240 --> 01:54:08,366
No Uncle, l might create problems
if l come there.

1665
01:54:08,575 --> 01:54:10,873
There won't be any problem.
l've forgotten the earlier incident.

1666
01:54:11,077 --> 01:54:13,045
Come & sit. Mangalam, get him a
glass of water.

1667
01:54:13,246 --> 01:54:14,543
Who's Mangalam?
ls she your wife?

1668
01:54:14,747 --> 01:54:17,215
She's just a maid servant.
Sometimes, she'll be my wife.

1669
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:18,216
Have it.

1670
01:54:19,185 --> 01:54:20,550
How come this vessel is damaged more?

1671
01:54:20,753 --> 01:54:21,481
Go inside.

1672
01:54:22,021 --> 01:54:24,216
Who's this boy, studying?
- He's my son.

1673
01:54:24,424 --> 01:54:25,721
He'll go to U.S. in a few days.

1674
01:54:25,925 --> 01:54:27,950
Do you mean Uzhavar Sandhai
(Farmers Market). - No, United States.

1675
01:54:28,761 --> 01:54:31,059
Who's this boy, polishing the shoes?
- He is....

1676
01:54:31,264 --> 01:54:33,232
He'll clean my son's shoes till
he completes his schooling.

1677
01:54:33,433 --> 01:54:33,990
After that,

1678
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:35,724
He'll clean my shoes till
l retire from my Office.

1679
01:54:35,935 --> 01:54:37,402
After that, will he
clean Aunt's shoes?

1680
01:54:38,605 --> 01:54:41,403
Both are of the same age.
Why don't you educate him also?

1681
01:54:41,608 --> 01:54:43,405
lf l educate him, then who'll work?

1682
01:54:43,610 --> 01:54:45,976
This is the land of Kamarajar,
who wanted everyone to get educated.

1683
01:54:46,179 --> 01:54:50,240
And Pasumpon, who, generously,
gave his wealth to others.

1684
01:54:50,450 --> 01:54:53,419
How can you make a small boy work?
This is Child Labour.

1685
01:54:53,620 --> 01:54:57,249
Hey, he'll study, he'll clean,
they're destined like that.

1686
01:54:57,957 --> 01:54:58,685
Hey, get up.

1687
01:54:59,392 --> 01:55:02,259
l'll educate you.
What do you want to study?

1688
01:55:02,462 --> 01:55:03,759
Law. - Law?

1689
01:55:04,297 --> 01:55:08,427
You scoundrel! You've made a future
Legal luminary to clean your shoes.

1690
01:55:08,635 --> 01:55:12,435
Which Law do you like to study?
Civil Law, Criminal Law or Company Law.

1691
01:55:12,639 --> 01:55:14,266
SHAKEELAW! - SHAKEELAW?

1692
01:55:17,310 --> 01:55:20,370
You've ruined him by allowing him to
watch ''Midnight Masala'' along with you.

1693
01:55:22,248 --> 01:55:23,112
Who were responsible for the
violence that broke out?

1694
01:55:23,316 --> 01:55:24,783
Annachi's 4 important men.

1695
01:55:25,151 --> 01:55:28,279
They're every thing to him.

1696
01:55:28,488 --> 01:55:31,184
lf you ask them to do something,
they'll always exceed their brief.

1697
01:55:32,325 --> 01:55:34,953
The affected people are stronger,
than the predators.

1698
01:55:35,495 --> 01:55:37,292
l'll tear them into pieces.

1699
01:55:37,497 --> 01:55:38,794
But you all must be with me.

1700
01:55:39,165 --> 01:55:41,463
Destroy all his wine shops,
brothel houses,

1701
01:55:41,668 --> 01:55:44,296
And his illegal breweries
in all the districts.

1702
01:55:44,504 --> 01:55:47,473
There'll be problem. l'll arrest
them & subsequently release you.

1703
01:55:48,274 --> 01:55:53,473
Seize all unlicenced buses, lorries and
close down all his illegal bars.

1704
01:55:57,183 --> 01:55:58,309
No..no...seize it.

1705
01:55:58,518 --> 01:55:59,985
Okay sir! we won't spare any one.

1706
01:56:03,856 --> 01:56:04,652
Go & check inside.

1707
01:56:05,525 --> 01:56:05,991
Take it.

1708
01:56:06,526 --> 01:56:08,426
Don't talk.
Take the bus to the station.

1709
01:56:10,196 --> 01:56:11,322
Take the bus to the station.

1710
01:56:19,539 --> 01:56:22,007
No sir, don't beat us.
- Seize all lorries.

1711
01:56:22,875 --> 01:56:25,002
This is Annachi's Sand quarry.
Don't create any problem unnecessarily.

1712
01:57:15,261 --> 01:57:16,228
Hey, stop it.

1713
01:57:16,596 --> 01:57:17,392
Why're you taking photographs?

1714
01:57:17,597 --> 01:57:18,894
We've to give this news to
the evening newspapers.

1715
01:57:19,098 --> 01:57:20,895
And we also need it for our records.
- As if he has come to pose...

1716
01:57:21,200 --> 01:57:23,395
Hey, if you want to take photographs
of all those who commit crimes,

1717
01:57:23,603 --> 01:57:24,661
Then, there'll be no one
left in Tamil Nadu.

1718
01:57:24,937 --> 01:57:26,564
Why do you publicize such
matters in newspapers,

1719
01:57:26,773 --> 01:57:28,570
And torture them mentally who're
already physically tortured?

1720
01:57:28,775 --> 01:57:30,572
You all can go... go...

1721
01:57:30,777 --> 01:57:31,744
You don't even have a moustache...

1722
01:57:31,944 --> 01:57:36,313
Sir, people who arrest us,
have a fling at us the next day.

1723
01:57:36,682 --> 01:57:38,673
But amongst them, you're the only
one who is so concerned about us.

1724
01:57:39,285 --> 01:57:40,582
Thank you very much, sir.
- Okay, go.

1725
01:57:45,558 --> 01:57:46,422
Paramasivam... - Sir.

1726
01:57:49,062 --> 01:57:51,257
Why're you seizing Annachi's lorries
and closing down wine shops?

1727
01:57:51,464 --> 01:57:52,931
All those shops don't have licenses.

1728
01:57:53,466 --> 01:57:54,524
All those lorries are
without permit.

1729
01:57:54,801 --> 01:57:55,995
l'm following the rules.

1730
01:57:57,470 --> 01:58:01,668
l feel ashamed to face Annachi.

1731
01:58:02,308 --> 01:58:04,367
He'll spit on us if we go now.

1732
01:58:04,877 --> 01:58:08,108
He has seized all our lorries,
closed down our shops & lodges.

1733
01:58:08,314 --> 01:58:10,441
He has sprouted just now.

1734
01:58:10,650 --> 01:58:12,117
Look, how he's wagging his tail.

1735
01:58:12,318 --> 01:58:14,445
Annachi made us MLAs.

1736
01:58:14,987 --> 01:58:16,454
Since we live at Annachi's mercy,

1737
01:58:17,490 --> 01:58:18,957
We must put him in jail.

1738
01:58:19,158 --> 01:58:20,785
Earlier, they used to give
free tea & money too.

1739
01:58:20,993 --> 01:58:23,291
Now, they're taking money before
supplying a tea, after your arrival.

1740
01:58:23,496 --> 01:58:24,622
l can make out from
your large girth.

1741
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,968
Do you consider yourself
a great police man?

1742
01:58:30,036 --> 01:58:33,597
lt seems, you'll take action against us.
Are you trying to threaten us?

1743
01:58:34,674 --> 01:58:36,642
Answer me, l'm asking you.

1744
01:58:36,843 --> 01:58:38,140
l consider it below my dignity
to talk to you.

1745
01:58:38,344 --> 01:58:39,641
What's so cheap about me?

1746
01:58:39,846 --> 01:58:45,478
l've the right to ask you and
dismiss you.

1747
01:58:45,685 --> 01:58:47,812
Go away silently.
l'm very angry with you.

1748
01:58:48,020 --> 01:58:50,147
Even my men are itching
to kill you.

1749
01:58:50,356 --> 01:58:53,154
One hint is enough
& they'll finish you.

1750
01:58:53,359 --> 01:58:54,986
Don't over stretch it, brother.
Just go away.

1751
01:58:55,194 --> 01:58:56,491
Why're you calling me brother?

1752
01:58:56,696 --> 01:58:58,994
Look at that head constable,
he's elder to me.

1753
01:58:59,198 --> 01:59:00,165
But, he's calling me sir.

1754
01:59:00,867 --> 01:59:09,832
Sometimes, we've to call, brother
sir, rowdy, rogue, pimp, idiot, fool etc.,

1755
01:59:12,044 --> 01:59:13,238
We were waiting for
this opportunity.

1756
01:59:13,880 --> 01:59:15,177
Hey, how dare you think of arresting
our MLA. - Arrest him.

1757
01:59:15,381 --> 01:59:17,849
Okay sir. - Yes sir.
- l'm a ruling party MLA.

1758
01:59:18,050 --> 01:59:19,847
l'll show you the consequences of
holding a police man's collar.

1759
01:59:20,052 --> 01:59:23,021
How dare you arrest me?
l'll see you later.

1760
01:59:23,222 --> 01:59:26,020
How dare you arrest
this lR-8 Sundaram?

1761
01:59:26,225 --> 01:59:28,693
lt's lR-30.
You've kept a wrong name.

1762
01:59:28,895 --> 01:59:31,864
l should've arrested you in just an
underwear & beaten you on the road.

1763
01:59:32,064 --> 01:59:34,692
l don't want to insult 67,500
people who had voted for you.

1764
01:59:34,901 --> 01:59:36,368
So, l'm taking you in a jeep.

1765
01:59:36,569 --> 01:59:38,196
Call the Commissioner.

1766
01:59:44,744 --> 01:59:45,540
Mr.Saamy! - Sir.

1767
01:59:45,745 --> 01:59:46,803
What's this? What's happening?

1768
01:59:47,079 --> 01:59:50,879
You've arrested an MLA on the road.
Why did you arrest him?

1769
01:59:51,083 --> 01:59:52,710
Last night he raped a woman.

1770
01:59:53,085 --> 01:59:55,053
l called him with all due
respects for enquiry.

1771
01:59:55,254 --> 01:59:57,154
He pulled me by my shirt.
l've proof for that.

1772
01:59:58,424 --> 02:00:01,052
What? Did l rape?
Where's the evidence?

1773
02:00:01,260 --> 02:00:02,557
l've a written complaint
from that woman.

1774
02:00:02,762 --> 02:00:06,220
Anyone can write a complaint
if they've a paper & pen.

1775
02:00:06,432 --> 02:00:07,228
Who's that woman?

1776
02:00:24,450 --> 02:00:26,077
Okay, you can proceed.
- Yes sir.

1777
02:00:28,454 --> 02:00:31,184
You once said, ''The girl was chubby
and beautiful, so he raped her.''

1778
02:00:31,791 --> 02:00:33,258
Look, l've arrested you for rape
without you raping anyone.

1779
02:00:33,459 --> 02:00:34,858
This is Saamy style.

1780
02:00:38,130 --> 02:00:38,926
Thanks Madam.

1781
02:00:41,133 --> 02:00:44,660
Annachi, Saamy has arrested
MLA lR-8 Sundaram also.

1782
02:00:53,980 --> 02:00:54,674
Oh my God!

1783
02:01:01,487 --> 02:01:02,215
Oh my God!

1784
02:01:03,823 --> 02:01:05,791
Dear. - Go away, don't disturb me.

1785
02:01:05,992 --> 02:01:07,960
All my clothes in the bureau
and box are missing.

1786
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:10,628
Will a thief dare to enter a police
man's house? Search properly.

1787
02:01:10,830 --> 02:01:12,297
l've searched properly.
Everything is missing.

1788
02:01:12,498 --> 02:01:13,965
Even the silk sari presented
by my mother is missing.

1789
02:01:14,166 --> 02:01:18,296
Chili powder! You're inciting my desires
by coming half naked early morning.

1790
02:01:20,339 --> 02:01:20,805
What?

1791
02:01:23,009 --> 02:01:24,636
ls the thief inside the house?

1792
02:01:25,011 --> 02:01:26,137
Bloody rascal!

1793
02:01:26,512 --> 02:01:28,309
You're that 4 letter word.

1794
02:01:28,848 --> 02:01:29,974
Why're you using foul language?

1795
02:01:30,182 --> 02:01:35,313
You had only said its rotten egg
& foolish monkey.

1796
02:01:35,855 --> 02:01:37,823
That's for others.
Do you know the real meaning?

1797
02:01:38,024 --> 02:01:38,991
Dirty fellow!

1798
02:01:39,859 --> 02:01:41,986
Give me a dirty kiss.
- Dirty kiss?

1799
02:01:42,194 --> 02:01:43,991
lf we both take bath and kiss,
it's a beauty kiss.

1800
02:01:44,196 --> 02:01:45,823
lf kissed without taking bath,
it's a dirty kiss.

1801
02:01:46,032 --> 02:01:46,498
Kiss me.

1802
02:01:53,873 --> 02:01:56,273
What're you doing?

1803
02:01:56,475 --> 02:01:59,410
l've plucked out the
gray hair which l hated.

1804
02:02:01,547 --> 02:02:02,980
This is `Theft case'.

1805
02:02:03,215 --> 02:02:05,843
Paramasivam, we've got a call that a bomb
is planted in Rathna theatre.

1806
02:02:06,052 --> 02:02:07,519
We must clear it,
come quickly...quick.

1807
02:02:07,887 --> 02:02:08,512
Control room.

1808
02:02:08,721 --> 02:02:10,086
Send the bomb squad
to Rathna theatre.

1809
02:02:18,397 --> 02:02:18,863
First send everyone inside.

1810
02:02:19,065 --> 02:02:20,532
First send all the spectators out.

1811
02:02:20,733 --> 02:02:22,860
Everyone go inside,
including the bomb squad.

1812
02:02:23,069 --> 02:02:24,366
Go quickly.
- Clear out people from here.

1813
02:02:24,570 --> 02:02:25,696
Search every corner.

1814
02:02:28,741 --> 02:02:29,366
Quick...quick...

1815
02:02:29,575 --> 02:02:31,202
Send out all the people and
close the gates.

1816
02:02:34,580 --> 02:02:37,640
Search the canteen. Go...go...

1817
02:02:43,422 --> 02:02:45,549
Sir, it's 1 1 a.m. now.
Go to the court immediately.

1818
02:02:45,758 --> 02:02:46,884
Or else that MLA will
come out on bail.

1819
02:02:47,093 --> 02:02:49,220
Whatever he might do,
he'll not get a bail.

1820
02:02:49,428 --> 02:02:52,397
Judge is on our side.
He'll definitely get 15 days remand.

1821
02:02:55,434 --> 02:02:57,561
Hello. - Saamy, the bomb isn't
in the theatre.

1822
02:02:57,770 --> 02:02:59,567
What're you saying?
- lt's in the bus station.

1823
02:02:59,772 --> 02:03:01,569
Go & save the people there.
- Who are you, man?

1824
02:03:05,277 --> 02:03:07,575
Check all the buses thoroughly.
Send all the passengers out.

1825
02:03:13,953 --> 02:03:15,580
All of you, go this side...
This side.

1826
02:03:29,969 --> 02:03:33,769
Hello. - Saamy, bomb is placed under
C.T's statue opposite the court.

1827
02:03:33,973 --> 02:03:35,941
Tell everyone to get down from the bus.
Get down...Get down.

1828
02:03:38,978 --> 02:03:39,603
Come here. - Sir.

1829
02:03:39,812 --> 02:03:40,437
l've a doubt.

1830
02:03:40,646 --> 02:03:42,273
You go and search Railway station,
schools & colleges.

1831
02:03:42,481 --> 02:03:43,106
Okay sir.
- l'll go to the court.

1832
02:03:43,315 --> 02:03:43,940
Okay sir.

1833
02:03:55,161 --> 02:03:58,790
Saamy, did you come here fearing
that the bomb will go off?

1834
02:03:59,331 --> 02:04:02,129
This is not a bomb that'll
blast but it's ''Zandu Balm'' (pain killer).

1835
02:04:02,334 --> 02:04:03,130
Look, its there.

1836
02:04:07,006 --> 02:04:08,871
You would've got tired by
running all over the city.

1837
02:04:09,074 --> 02:04:10,974
Your knees must be paining,
use the pain balm.

1838
02:04:14,346 --> 02:04:15,142
Why're you staring at me?

1839
02:04:15,347 --> 02:04:19,147
l stopped you from going to
court to attend MLA's case.

1840
02:04:20,252 --> 02:04:21,480
Go away coolly from here.

1841
02:04:21,687 --> 02:04:24,315
Next time instead of ''Zandu Balm'',
it'll be gelatin bomb.

1842
02:04:26,358 --> 02:04:26,824
Sir.

1843
02:04:27,026 --> 02:04:29,551
Mr.Saamy, what do you
think of yourself?

1844
02:04:29,762 --> 02:04:31,821
You're going all over the city
with police & bomb squad.

1845
02:04:32,031 --> 02:04:33,828
And creating nuisance to the public.

1846
02:04:34,033 --> 02:04:35,330
Sir, a phone call...

1847
02:04:36,035 --> 02:04:38,503
Believing an anonymous
phone call you've...

1848
02:04:38,704 --> 02:04:39,500
What nonsense is this?

1849
02:04:39,705 --> 02:04:41,434
Stop everything and come to
my office immediately.

1850
02:04:41,707 --> 02:04:44,505
Sir, the phone call about
a bomb is not a hoax.

1851
02:04:44,710 --> 02:04:46,177
lt's true. - What're you saying?

1852
02:04:46,378 --> 02:04:48,505
lt was found inside Athangarai MLA
Shanmugham's car.

1853
02:04:49,215 --> 02:04:50,011
What happened to the MLA?

1854
02:04:50,216 --> 02:04:54,016
Sir, l was able to save the MLA
but not his car.

1855
02:05:10,069 --> 02:05:11,468
Hey, what're you doing?

1856
02:05:29,755 --> 02:05:32,053
You're not in my hit-list. Why're you falling
into the trap?

1857
02:05:33,926 --> 02:05:35,052
l'll fix you.

1858
02:05:38,430 --> 02:05:40,625
l noticed all the 7 people keenly
while running out to clear the bomb.

1859
02:05:41,934 --> 02:05:44,903
l observed the sincerity in your swiftness
in defusing the bomb.

1860
02:05:45,771 --> 02:05:49,400
ln my fight against Annachi,
can you support me indirectly?

1861
02:05:49,608 --> 02:05:52,236
Till now, no officer had
acted against Annachi.

1862
02:05:52,778 --> 02:05:55,406
lf you're doing it,
we'll support you openly.

1863
02:05:57,449 --> 02:06:01,249
For the first time, they've called me
for an inter caste marriage.

1864
02:06:01,453 --> 02:06:02,920
l'm very happy.

1865
02:06:02,988 --> 02:06:05,582
Move! l want to see the groom & bride.
Move...move...

1866
02:06:07,626 --> 02:06:10,925
What's this? The bride looks
like a donkey.

1867
02:06:11,297 --> 02:06:13,857
Donkey is the bride.
- ls donkey the bride?

1868
02:06:14,967 --> 02:06:15,763
What's this?

1869
02:06:16,302 --> 02:06:18,429
You can have marriage
between different castes.

1870
02:06:18,637 --> 02:06:20,264
lnter-religion marriages
are also acceptable.

1871
02:06:20,472 --> 02:06:24,431
But you've become too modern
by marrying a donkey.

1872
02:06:24,643 --> 02:06:25,610
There is no rain for
the past 2 years.

1873
02:06:25,811 --> 02:06:28,439
According to a tradition, if anyone
marries a donkey, a chameleon or a frog.

1874
02:06:28,647 --> 02:06:29,443
lt'll rain, won't it?

1875
02:06:30,149 --> 02:06:33,778
Why don't you marry a lion?
- lt'll eat me alive.

1876
02:06:33,986 --> 02:06:34,953
You know that, don't you?

1877
02:06:35,154 --> 02:06:37,622
Why're you still superstitious?

1878
02:06:38,157 --> 02:06:39,624
You're breaking a coconut
on tonsured head.

1879
02:06:39,825 --> 02:06:42,293
lf it bleeds, you'll call it
as wrath of God.

1880
02:06:42,494 --> 02:06:46,294
You're offering goat, hen, pig, buffalo
& everything other than man.

1881
02:06:46,498 --> 02:06:48,466
Then you eat everything.
What's all this?

1882
02:06:48,667 --> 02:06:51,227
You had taken the advance
to conduct the marriage.

1883
02:06:52,338 --> 02:06:53,635
Never let go an opportunity
to threaten people.

1884
02:06:54,506 --> 02:06:56,474
Take this auspicious thread and
tie the knot. - Recite the hymns.

1885
02:06:57,009 --> 02:06:57,634
Hymn?

1886
02:07:03,515 --> 02:07:04,709
Stop it. This isn't a hymn.

1887
02:07:05,517 --> 02:07:08,486
This hymn is enough for
donkey's marriage.

1888
02:07:08,687 --> 02:07:09,654
Tie the auspicious thread.

1889
02:07:09,855 --> 02:07:13,985
My grandson is coming
majestically like a lion.

1890
02:07:14,193 --> 02:07:17,253
Anyone crossing swords with him
will not be able to bear his kick.

1891
02:07:22,534 --> 02:07:25,162
Hey, donkey got enraged and kicked
his sensitive part.

1892
02:07:26,872 --> 02:07:29,670
This donkey has become
punching donkey.

1893
02:07:29,875 --> 02:07:32,673
You all planned a marriage
of the donkey.

1894
02:07:32,878 --> 02:07:36,279
But, this donkey has made
him impotent.

1895
02:07:36,882 --> 02:07:37,678
What's this sir?

1896
02:07:37,916 --> 02:07:40,043
They're planning a protest for reservation
and presenting a memorandum.

1897
02:07:40,219 --> 02:07:41,345
You've permitted them.

1898
02:07:41,553 --> 02:07:42,679
Two MLA's are leading
the procession.

1899
02:07:42,888 --> 02:07:44,185
Minister ordered me to permit them.

1900
02:07:44,390 --> 02:07:45,516
What can l do other
than permit them?

1901
02:07:45,724 --> 02:07:47,521
You restrict yourself to
security arrangements only.

1902
02:07:48,394 --> 02:07:50,521
Sir, what happened?
- He has given them the permission.

1903
02:07:50,729 --> 02:07:52,697
Then, you don't stay here.
- What are you saying?

1904
02:07:52,898 --> 02:07:54,866
They all are very angry with you.

1905
02:07:55,401 --> 02:07:57,369
2 years ago just like this,
They planned a procession.

1906
02:07:57,569 --> 02:07:59,366
And ransacked Melapalayam
Police station.

1907
02:07:59,571 --> 02:08:01,300
Four people hacked
the lnspector to death.

1908
02:08:01,740 --> 02:08:05,039
As the procession crosses Corporation
office starting from bus station.

1909
02:08:05,577 --> 02:08:06,703
There's a petty shop
which belongs to our man.

1910
02:08:06,912 --> 02:08:08,777
Soda water bottles will be
supplied from there.

1911
02:08:09,081 --> 02:08:10,378
That's their first weapon.

1912
02:08:10,582 --> 02:08:12,049
Further up from there,
it's ''Kandappa lathe works.''

1913
02:08:12,251 --> 02:08:13,548
We'll get sickles from there.

1914
02:08:13,752 --> 02:08:15,879
They'll try to attack us as soon as
they get hold of the weapons.

1915
02:08:16,088 --> 02:08:19,057
Since the Collector is out of station,
they'll not get firing orders.

1916
02:08:19,258 --> 02:08:22,227
They'll cross their limits thinking
that we'll not get firing orders.

1917
02:08:22,428 --> 02:08:23,224
l'll take care of that.

1918
02:08:23,429 --> 02:08:25,397
As procession nears the police station,
...clashes must break out.

1919
02:08:25,497 --> 02:08:28,295
ln that, police station and
Saamy, both must be annihilated.

1920
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:31,330
Files which we can't be closed legally
must be closed illegally.

1921
02:08:31,603 --> 02:08:33,730
Sir, you're saying that....
- You'll understand.

1922
02:08:34,606 --> 02:08:35,903
Another very important thing.

1923
02:08:36,775 --> 02:08:39,573
No pressmen must photograph the event.
Even if they manage,

1924
02:08:39,778 --> 02:08:41,336
Only smoke must be seen in
those photos, okay?

1925
02:08:43,282 --> 02:08:45,409
We'll be in trouble only if they
cross corporation office.

1926
02:08:46,618 --> 02:08:47,414
They'll never cross it.

1927
02:08:47,619 --> 02:08:53,751
ls this strength enough
or do you want more?

1928
02:08:53,959 --> 02:08:56,757
How dare you challenge our Boss?

1929
02:08:56,962 --> 02:09:00,420
We'll fight till we get justice.

1930
02:09:00,632 --> 02:09:06,935
Remove... - Poverty...

1931
02:09:07,139 --> 02:09:10,267
Don't take away...
- Don't take away our rights.

1932
02:09:10,476 --> 02:09:17,780
Handcuff the police.
We'll give them a run for their money.

1933
02:09:17,983 --> 02:09:20,383
Today, they're in for some boons from Saamy(God).

1934
02:09:22,654 --> 02:09:24,281
They're raising slogans without
knowing our D.C.

1935
02:09:25,991 --> 02:09:28,789
Sir, as soon as we cross Corporation
office, we'll get weapons.

1936
02:09:29,161 --> 02:09:31,721
l'll make the first kill of D.C.
- Okay.

1937
02:09:31,930 --> 02:09:33,124
We must do as sir has ordered us.

1938
02:09:33,332 --> 02:09:35,800
Hello... - We'll be reaching
Corporation office shortly.

1939
02:09:36,001 --> 02:09:37,730
We are ready.
- You must strictly follow my orders.

1940
02:09:43,509 --> 02:09:45,306
We are hearing. - Okay sir.

1941
02:09:46,678 --> 02:09:48,407
Get the ambulance ready.
- Okay, sir.

1942
02:09:50,015 --> 02:09:53,815
We are going to teach a
lesson to the police.

1943
02:09:54,019 --> 02:10:00,322
Don't take away our rights.

1944
02:10:00,526 --> 02:10:04,826
Tirunelveli district is going
to teach you a lesson.

1945
02:10:05,030 --> 02:10:05,655
Baton charge.

1946
02:10:08,700 --> 02:10:09,667
Ambulance is ready.

1947
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:23,347
Hey, who's throwing
stones at us?

1948
02:10:23,549 --> 02:10:24,345
Stop it.

1949
02:10:24,716 --> 02:10:25,182
Beat them back, boys.

1950
02:10:26,051 --> 02:10:27,916
Baton charge!

1951
02:10:29,054 --> 02:10:31,181
Down with Police atrocities....

1952
02:10:31,390 --> 02:10:32,857
Hey, stop.

1953
02:10:33,725 --> 02:10:39,357
Down with the Police atrocities.

1954
02:10:42,067 --> 02:10:43,364
Tear gas.

1955
02:10:47,906 --> 02:10:49,703
Hey, don't spare them.
Beat them.

1956
02:11:24,776 --> 02:11:25,242
Go away.

1957
02:11:35,787 --> 02:11:37,914
You raped my sister.

1958
02:11:39,625 --> 02:11:41,525
Hereafter you can never rape any girl.

1959
02:11:46,798 --> 02:11:49,266
Hey, how dare you catch me?
l'm an MLA.

1960
02:11:49,468 --> 02:11:49,991
Come, man.

1961
02:11:52,304 --> 02:11:53,999
How can l fire without orders?

1962
02:11:54,473 --> 02:11:56,600
My pistol and six bullets are here.

1963
02:11:56,808 --> 02:11:57,274
Then, who shot them dead?

1964
02:11:57,476 --> 02:11:59,774
5000 people were in that procession.
10,000 people were watching the fun.

1965
02:11:59,978 --> 02:12:01,104
How can l know who shot them dead?

1966
02:12:01,313 --> 02:12:02,940
So, l was against giving
them permission.

1967
02:12:03,148 --> 02:12:04,615
Now, you're responsible for
all the trouble.

1968
02:12:04,983 --> 02:12:07,451
Okay! Atleast release that
Athankarai Shanmugam.

1969
02:12:07,653 --> 02:12:09,280
Till l get clear evidence
about the death of 3 people,

1970
02:12:09,488 --> 02:12:10,284
l'll not release them.

1971
02:12:10,489 --> 02:12:13,117
Are you talking so bravely as your
records are straight?

1972
02:12:13,659 --> 02:12:15,627
You don't know the
reach of Annachi!

1973
02:12:15,827 --> 02:12:17,124
l don't want to know.

1974
02:12:27,005 --> 02:12:27,630
Greetings sir.

1975
02:12:27,839 --> 02:12:30,307
Why're you greeting me, man?
Fire...fire at me.

1976
02:12:31,009 --> 02:12:33,569
He shot my men.
You fire at me.

1977
02:12:33,845 --> 02:12:35,244
Welcome, Perumal Pitchai.

1978
02:12:35,681 --> 02:12:40,311
You've killed my men and accounted
their deaths under communal clashes.

1979
02:12:40,519 --> 02:12:43,317
lt's true, l shot them dead, then.
lt's true your men saw me.

1980
02:12:43,522 --> 02:12:44,318
But, there are no records.

1981
02:12:44,523 --> 02:12:48,983
Hey, are you teaching me the game
in which l'm an expert?

1982
02:12:49,194 --> 02:12:50,991
lf there's a reason,
l'll use Government pistol.

1983
02:12:51,196 --> 02:12:52,493
Or else an illegal pistol.

1984
02:12:52,864 --> 02:12:54,661
A sickle used by anyone
will hurt you.

1985
02:12:55,200 --> 02:12:56,997
A pistol fired by
anyone will kill.

1986
02:12:57,869 --> 02:12:58,665
Watch out, in 2 days...

1987
02:12:58,870 --> 02:12:59,837
How dare you point your
finger at Annachi?

1988
02:13:00,038 --> 02:13:01,665
Oh, shouldn't l talk pointing
a finger at him?

1989
02:13:06,545 --> 02:13:10,504
l'll make you run away
leaving everything behind.

1990
02:13:10,716 --> 02:13:15,176
Down with police atrocities.

1991
02:13:15,387 --> 02:13:21,690
People waiting outside will kill any
number of people on a hint from me.

1992
02:13:21,893 --> 02:13:25,021
The guns here will fire at any
number of people on my orders.

1993
02:13:25,230 --> 02:13:27,198
l'll immolate here for Annachi.

1994
02:13:28,734 --> 02:13:30,702
l'll immolate here.

1995
02:13:30,902 --> 02:13:38,206
Down with Police atrocities.

1996
02:13:38,410 --> 02:13:39,877
l'll immolate for Annachi.

1997
02:13:45,250 --> 02:13:46,649
l think he'll really burn us down...
Run away from here.

1998
02:13:47,753 --> 02:13:48,378
Run away.

1999
02:13:53,425 --> 02:13:54,722
l'm like a live wire.

2000
02:13:55,260 --> 02:13:56,659
lf you touch, you can't
bear the shock.

2001
02:14:01,933 --> 02:14:04,401
He has insulted us.
Annachi, what shall we do now?

2002
02:14:04,603 --> 02:14:08,130
lnform our boys in Kaitharu
and get him lynched.

2003
02:14:08,774 --> 02:14:11,072
l was never afraid even when l
went against the British.

2004
02:14:11,443 --> 02:14:14,469
But, l'm damn scared
of these murderers.

2005
02:14:15,447 --> 02:14:18,416
l'm anticipating trouble here
any moment.

2006
02:14:18,617 --> 02:14:20,244
When there are so many
policemen around,

2007
02:14:20,452 --> 02:14:22,579
And when they are not bothered,
why are you?

2008
02:14:22,788 --> 02:14:25,916
Son-in-law, everyone has come
out with fear.

2009
02:14:26,124 --> 02:14:27,591
l don't know what to say.

2010
02:14:27,959 --> 02:14:32,589
You both must be safe & happy.

2011
02:14:32,964 --> 02:14:35,592
Anyway, you're going out from
here on a transfer.

2012
02:14:35,801 --> 02:14:38,429
You go away today.
No one will be in any trouble.

2013
02:14:38,637 --> 02:14:41,538
Son-in-law...
- Father, all of you may go now.

2014
02:14:42,407 --> 02:14:43,339
Nothing will happen to me.

2015
02:14:44,242 --> 02:14:45,869
You don't unnecessarily
make him tense.

2016
02:14:46,645 --> 02:14:47,111
Please go away.

2017
02:14:50,816 --> 02:14:55,378
Did you send them out to pacify me?
Or are you really confident about me?

2018
02:14:56,321 --> 02:14:58,846
lf anything happens to me,
you'll be the worst affected.

2019
02:14:59,991 --> 02:15:01,959
lf your confidence in me has dipped
even by 1 percent, tell me.

2020
02:15:02,427 --> 02:15:03,223
We'll leave this place.

2021
02:15:05,664 --> 02:15:09,964
l've 100% confidence in you.
You'll definitely win.

2022
02:15:14,906 --> 02:15:17,704
Brother, son-in-law hasn't taken
any of our advise.

2023
02:15:18,009 --> 02:15:22,036
You advise him. - You don't worry.
l'll talk to him.

2024
02:15:29,688 --> 02:15:32,156
Are you scared? - No.

2025
02:15:32,357 --> 02:15:33,585
Why're your eyes
filled with tears?

2026
02:15:34,192 --> 02:15:35,056
Sacred ash fell into my eyes.

2027
02:15:35,360 --> 02:15:36,987
Son, where are you?
- ln the temple, father.

2028
02:15:37,195 --> 02:15:38,492
l heard you had been transferred.

2029
02:15:38,697 --> 02:15:39,994
l heard you're in some trouble.

2030
02:15:40,198 --> 02:15:41,165
Shall l come there?

2031
02:15:41,366 --> 02:15:42,663
No need. Problem will be
solved in 2 days.

2032
02:15:43,034 --> 02:15:44,001
l'll come back there.

2033
02:15:44,202 --> 02:15:45,169
Don't unnecessarily come here.

2034
02:15:45,537 --> 02:15:46,003
Okay, son.

2035
02:16:03,221 --> 02:16:04,916
Bhuvana, remove your slippers and
go into the temple immediately.

2036
02:16:05,123 --> 02:16:05,589
Why?

2037
02:16:05,957 --> 02:16:06,685
Just follow my orders.

2038
02:16:07,292 --> 02:16:08,088
Sister, take her.

2039
02:17:06,751 --> 02:17:11,211
Can't you understand why a man
is running away with a pistol?

2040
02:17:13,024 --> 02:17:16,289
lf l beat you in front of the temple,
it'll be a disturbance to devotees.

2041
02:17:18,029 --> 02:17:22,591
lt's better to slaughter a goat in
a closed area than on the road.

2042
02:17:27,806 --> 02:17:28,534
What're you looking at?

2043
02:17:29,674 --> 02:17:31,665
God will get into a trance only
when drums are beaten.

2044
02:19:08,206 --> 02:19:10,766
Saamy has told you not to go there.
Why're you going there?

2045
02:19:10,975 --> 02:19:15,071
No, l'm anxious.
l'll check personally.

2046
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:17,214
Bhuvana, you leave for
Palani immediately. - Why?

2047
02:19:17,415 --> 02:19:18,780
We've just 24 hours.

2048
02:19:19,284 --> 02:19:20,774
You mustn't get into any
trouble before that.

2049
02:19:21,486 --> 02:19:22,714
l'll come there by
tomorrow evening.

2050
02:19:22,987 --> 02:19:24,113
Who's going with you?

2051
02:19:24,322 --> 02:19:25,220
l'm going alone, mother.

2052
02:19:25,423 --> 02:19:26,617
Go safely, dear.

2053
02:19:26,825 --> 02:19:27,291
Okay, mother.

2054
02:19:28,760 --> 02:19:29,226
Tell me, Babu.

2055
02:19:29,427 --> 02:19:32,396
Perumal Pitchai talked to
Pattasu Raman of Sivakasi.

2056
02:19:32,597 --> 02:19:33,256
What did he say?

2057
02:19:33,465 --> 02:19:36,400
He said we must create a
`loud noise' in Tirunelveli.

2058
02:19:36,901 --> 02:19:39,665
l think `loud noise' is
their code word.

2059
02:19:40,739 --> 02:19:42,468
ln Sivakasi, bursting of crackers
will make loud noise.

2060
02:19:42,674 --> 02:19:45,142
Crackers, loud noise?
Anything connected with bomb?

2061
02:19:46,511 --> 02:19:47,307
lt must be a bomb.

2062
02:19:47,579 --> 02:19:51,208
l want to talk to you...Come...

2063
02:19:52,183 --> 02:19:53,741
No. l'll get into the jeep
without warrant.

2064
02:19:54,986 --> 02:19:55,884
l've not come in a jeep.

2065
02:19:56,221 --> 02:19:59,748
You're facing charges of 4 murders, arson,
stabbing and many other crimes.

2066
02:20:00,024 --> 02:20:02,584
We can put you in jail
for 12 years.

2067
02:20:03,862 --> 02:20:07,491
Or else with one shot,
l can close the file as a murder.

2068
02:20:09,701 --> 02:20:10,429
Don't get scared.

2069
02:20:11,369 --> 02:20:12,996
l would've killed you that day,
if had l wanted to.

2070
02:20:14,205 --> 02:20:16,002
When l shot others,
l saw only individuals.

2071
02:20:16,207 --> 02:20:19,005
But, when l aimed at you,
l saw your wife & children.

2072
02:20:19,711 --> 02:20:20,507
lf you follow my orders.

2073
02:20:20,712 --> 02:20:23,408
l'll dilute the cases so that you'll
get 2 or 3 years jail term.

2074
02:20:23,748 --> 02:20:24,237
What do you say?

2075
02:20:25,483 --> 02:20:26,848
l'll always keep up my promise.

2076
02:20:27,886 --> 02:20:28,511
Okay.

2077
02:20:28,720 --> 02:20:33,248
Annachi has called Pattasu Raman
to plant a bomb here. - Why?

2078
02:20:34,058 --> 02:20:35,525
To plant a bomb in your house.

2079
02:20:35,727 --> 02:20:37,024
What're you saying man?

2080
02:20:37,228 --> 02:20:41,358
He has asked him plant the bomb
to go off at 10.30 p.m.

2081
02:20:41,966 --> 02:20:43,763
And asked him to stay
at Hotel Sugam.

2082
02:20:43,968 --> 02:20:45,196
Sir, let's go immediately. - No.

2083
02:20:47,238 --> 02:20:48,034
Let the bomb go off.

2084
02:20:49,073 --> 02:20:50,040
What're you saying sir?

2085
02:20:51,743 --> 02:20:53,711
This is the only way to
arrest Perumal Pitchai.

2086
02:20:53,912 --> 02:20:55,880
He has become an approver.
We can arrest Pattasu Raman.

2087
02:20:56,080 --> 02:20:58,207
With this evidence we can arrest him.
- Case will not stand in the court.

2088
02:20:58,783 --> 02:21:00,717
Because of the influence he has,
he'll walk out freely.

2089
02:21:01,252 --> 02:21:01,980
Let my house get blasted off.

2090
02:21:02,420 --> 02:21:04,684
Only then, l can arrest him under
Terrorist act. - Then, Bhuvana?

2091
02:21:04,889 --> 02:21:05,787
She's on the way to Palani.

2092
02:21:05,990 --> 02:21:08,049
Look, the bomb will
blast at 10.30 p.m.

2093
02:21:08,259 --> 02:21:10,056
Arrest Pattasu Raman
exactly at 10.35 p.m.

2094
02:21:10,261 --> 02:21:11,728
l'll go & meet the Commissioner. - Why?

2095
02:21:13,198 --> 02:21:14,995
Department must know Annachi
has planted a bomb.

2096
02:21:15,733 --> 02:21:17,098
But they mustn't
know the location.

2097
02:21:17,435 --> 02:21:19,027
No one can harm my son.

2098
02:21:19,671 --> 02:21:21,400
lf you all stay here,
he'll give up a winning race.

2099
02:21:22,207 --> 02:21:24,072
And spend his entire energy
to save your lives.

2100
02:21:24,275 --> 02:21:25,867
So, go to Palani immediately.

2101
02:21:26,211 --> 02:21:28,372
No one can harm my son
till l'm alive.

2102
02:21:28,613 --> 02:21:30,012
l'll come with him tomorrow.

2103
02:21:30,215 --> 02:21:33,082
Pattasu Raman come immediately. We must
create a loud noise in Tirunelveli.

2104
02:21:35,153 --> 02:21:39,419
lf we touch Annachi, we'll get orders
from C.M.. Who'll face the consequences.

2105
02:21:39,624 --> 02:21:42,092
lf we don't take any action
and the bomb goes off.

2106
02:21:42,293 --> 02:21:44,261
Still, we've to face the heat from C.M.
- Everything is your doing.

2107
02:21:44,462 --> 02:21:46,760
For the action you took against them
in the procession.

2108
02:21:46,965 --> 02:21:49,593
Tell me your decision to
solve this problem.

2109
02:21:50,802 --> 02:21:52,929
First, send a message of alert
to all police stations.

2110
02:22:00,144 --> 02:22:01,111
Sir, here are the keys.

2111
02:22:02,847 --> 02:22:03,871
Shall l get you something to eat?

2112
02:22:04,082 --> 02:22:07,381
No need. l'll eat along
with my son. - Okay sir.

2113
02:22:21,866 --> 02:22:22,457
Hello.

2114
02:22:22,667 --> 02:22:23,861
l'm Saamy's father speaking.

2115
02:22:24,068 --> 02:22:25,558
Sir has gone to meet Commissioner.

2116
02:22:25,837 --> 02:22:26,633
You call him on his cell phone.

2117
02:22:29,374 --> 02:22:31,171
Sir is in a meeting
with Commissioner.

2118
02:22:31,342 --> 02:22:32,809
So, he has left his phone with me.

2119
02:22:33,077 --> 02:22:35,568
Tell him, l've come here.
l'll talk to him later.

2120
02:22:39,450 --> 02:22:40,747
Sir, you got a call
from your father.

2121
02:22:43,354 --> 02:22:45,322
From where did he call me?
- He called from your house only.

2122
02:22:46,658 --> 02:22:47,215
What are you saying?

2123
02:22:47,525 --> 02:22:49,152
He said he had come just now
from your native place.

2124
02:22:49,527 --> 02:22:51,154
Oh shit!

2125
02:22:58,870 --> 02:23:01,498
My daughter-in-law and her
relatives are coming there.

2126
02:23:01,706 --> 02:23:03,833
Take good care of them.
- Okay sir.

2127
02:23:06,878 --> 02:23:08,175
They're strict vegetarians.

2128
02:23:08,379 --> 02:23:10,176
Tell servants to clean the
vessels thoroughly.

2129
02:23:11,549 --> 02:23:14,347
lt seems some Perumal Pitchai
is troubling my son.

2130
02:23:14,886 --> 02:23:17,013
l'll kill him myself
and go to jail.

2131
02:23:17,221 --> 02:23:18,882
But, l'll not allow him
to touch my son.

2132
02:23:26,564 --> 02:23:27,963
Father, come out of the
house immediately.

2133
02:23:28,166 --> 02:23:28,757
Why?

2134
02:23:28,967 --> 02:23:30,798
A bomb has been planted in our house.
Come out immediately.

2135
02:23:31,736 --> 02:23:32,202
What?

2136
02:23:35,740 --> 02:23:36,365
Oh my god!

2137
02:23:43,915 --> 02:23:44,540
Father...

2138
02:23:46,017 --> 02:23:48,645
Father...

2139
02:23:49,253 --> 02:23:50,379
Father...

2140
02:23:59,430 --> 02:24:00,055
Father...

2141
02:24:01,265 --> 02:24:01,890
Father...

2142
02:24:18,082 --> 02:24:20,550
Father...

2143
02:24:34,799 --> 02:24:36,426
He has been with
Annachi for 16 years.

2144
02:24:36,968 --> 02:24:38,265
l wish to become an approver.

2145
02:24:44,142 --> 02:24:45,700
l heard about it...sorry.

2146
02:24:48,646 --> 02:24:49,203
Best of luck.

2147
02:24:49,480 --> 02:24:51,607
l told you to keep cool for 2 days.

2148
02:24:51,983 --> 02:24:53,280
Why did you plant
a bomb in his house?

2149
02:24:53,484 --> 02:24:55,213
Already he's after you
like a mad dog.

2150
02:24:55,653 --> 02:24:57,848
He made a fool proof
case against you.

2151
02:24:58,056 --> 02:24:59,455
And has taken arrest
warrant against you.

2152
02:24:59,657 --> 02:25:04,959
l can't help you anymore. Abscond for a
day or get yourself arrested.

2153
02:25:05,496 --> 02:25:07,123
Whom are you suggesting
to surrender?

2154
02:25:07,432 --> 02:25:10,128
lf l get arrested, Tirunelveli will
rise against him.

2155
02:25:10,668 --> 02:25:12,295
lnsult...it's an insult.

2156
02:25:12,670 --> 02:25:15,969
Getting arrested is impossible
in my life.

2157
02:25:16,174 --> 02:25:18,802
Okay. l'll talk to him
once again for you.

2158
02:25:20,678 --> 02:25:25,138
Hey, kill everyone in his family.

2159
02:25:25,349 --> 02:25:27,647
He has already packed them
all to his native place.

2160
02:25:33,958 --> 02:25:36,256
Sir, call from the Commissioner.

2161
02:25:36,461 --> 02:25:39,589
An urgent secret meeting has
been arranged in our Dept.

2162
02:25:39,797 --> 02:25:40,923
You must come immediately.

2163
02:25:41,466 --> 02:25:44,435
Ministers, MLAs, District Collectors
from 8 districts are coming.

2164
02:25:44,635 --> 02:25:45,602
You must attend without fail.

2165
02:25:47,805 --> 02:25:48,328
Hello...

2166
02:25:48,639 --> 02:25:49,765
l'm DC's wife speaking.

2167
02:25:50,141 --> 02:25:51,199
House phone is not responding,

2168
02:25:51,409 --> 02:25:52,273
l'm not able to reach him
on cell phone also.

2169
02:25:52,577 --> 02:25:54,602
Please give him the phone.
- Sir is in hospital.

2170
02:25:54,812 --> 02:25:55,938
Why? What happened to him?

2171
02:25:56,147 --> 02:25:57,614
Don't you know house was
blasted off with a bomb?

2172
02:25:57,815 --> 02:25:58,281
What're you saying?

2173
02:25:58,483 --> 02:26:02,442
Don't tell her. - Hello...hello...
What happened to him?

2174
02:26:02,653 --> 02:26:04,120
Sir is safe.
You don't worry.

2175
02:26:04,655 --> 02:26:05,451
Why did you tell her?

2176
02:26:05,656 --> 02:26:07,180
lt's midnight now.
You want to go there.

2177
02:26:07,391 --> 02:26:08,790
Your parents are on the way.

2178
02:26:08,993 --> 02:26:12,690
Even if l catch the last bus.
l'll reach by morning.

2179
02:26:12,897 --> 02:26:14,296
Drop me at bus stand.

2180
02:26:16,400 --> 02:26:18,061
Mr.Saamy, please don't
arrest Annachi.

2181
02:26:18,269 --> 02:26:20,464
lf you arrest him, it'll
create political problems.

2182
02:26:20,671 --> 02:26:23,139
Sorry sir. l don't care about it.

2183
02:26:23,341 --> 02:26:24,808
His influence extends from
State to Central level.

2184
02:26:25,343 --> 02:26:27,311
You're not going to
stay here tomorrow.

2185
02:26:27,512 --> 02:26:28,638
Then, why're you creating
trouble for him?

2186
02:26:28,846 --> 02:26:31,872
Ten years ago, you were
a vegetable seller.

2187
02:26:32,083 --> 02:26:32,981
Today, you're a Minister.

2188
02:26:33,351 --> 02:26:34,648
You own 5 colleges.

2189
02:26:34,852 --> 02:26:35,648
You don't say a word.

2190
02:26:36,187 --> 02:26:37,484
Why're you talking bad about him?

2191
02:26:37,688 --> 02:26:41,647
You're telling me not to arrest
an accused? - Are you Mr.Clean?

2192
02:26:42,026 --> 02:26:45,826
You had taken Rs.34 lakhs as
bribe from Annachi. - Deny it.

2193
02:26:46,864 --> 02:26:48,195
No.

2194
02:26:49,934 --> 02:26:53,836
He has given the list of bribes
he gave you, date-wise.

2195
02:26:55,873 --> 02:26:59,832
l didn't take Rs.34 lakhs,
but Rs.36 lakhs 50 thousand.

2196
02:27:00,745 --> 02:27:02,906
l was about to tell that he had
left out a few payments.

2197
02:27:04,715 --> 02:27:05,773
l've full account of it.

2198
02:27:06,551 --> 02:27:07,518
The money he paid me on a date....

2199
02:27:07,718 --> 02:27:08,946
l've sent it to Gujarat
Earth quake relief fund.

2200
02:27:09,153 --> 02:27:10,381
Orissa starvation deaths,
cyclone relief fund...

2201
02:27:10,588 --> 02:27:12,749
To CM's welfare fund...

2202
02:27:12,957 --> 02:27:14,720
l've receipts on his name
as money sent by him.

2203
02:27:22,800 --> 02:27:23,698
What're you looking at?

2204
02:27:24,101 --> 02:27:26,365
Annachi is not a meek cat to kick.

2205
02:27:26,571 --> 02:27:27,037
He's an Elephant.

2206
02:27:27,805 --> 02:27:28,737
We must get on its head to beat it.

2207
02:27:29,407 --> 02:27:31,534
So, l took money from him
and his built trust on me.

2208
02:27:32,410 --> 02:27:33,035
Now, l'm beating him.

2209
02:27:33,411 --> 02:27:34,639
Then, you took Rs.4 lakhs
from a killer.

2210
02:27:34,912 --> 02:27:36,880
And Rs.3 lakhs from a man
who ran over another man...

2211
02:27:37,248 --> 02:27:38,215
On what account?

2212
02:27:40,418 --> 02:27:41,214
Justice Account!

2213
02:27:42,587 --> 02:27:43,713
lf we arrest any who runs over
another man with his car.

2214
02:27:43,921 --> 02:27:44,888
You'll jail him for 3 months.

2215
02:27:45,089 --> 02:27:46,113
He'll pay Rs.3000 as fine
and goes out scott free.

2216
02:27:46,324 --> 02:27:47,552
Who'll feed the victim's family?

2217
02:27:48,960 --> 02:27:50,894
So, l took Rs.4 lakhs from him and
paid it to the victim's family.

2218
02:27:52,096 --> 02:27:53,893
l'm concerned about dead man
than the killer.

2219
02:27:54,765 --> 02:27:56,562
Tell me, if anyone has complained that
l've taken bribe from general public.

2220
02:27:56,767 --> 02:27:58,291
l'll kill myself at that very moment.

2221
02:27:59,770 --> 02:28:03,228
A man living on bribes will not have
2 sets of uniform & torn socks.

2222
02:28:04,609 --> 02:28:09,069
To join police! My father is still paying
interest on Rs.2 lakhs loan.

2223
02:28:09,447 --> 02:28:10,311
Leave it.

2224
02:28:10,681 --> 02:28:14,082
Are you running a police station
according to law or a jungle justice?

2225
02:28:14,452 --> 02:28:17,910
Will you change laws like
you change clothes?

2226
02:28:18,122 --> 02:28:19,248
What's so great about law?

2227
02:28:20,291 --> 02:28:21,758
When Tamil Nadu was
under Prohibition,

2228
02:28:21,959 --> 02:28:23,256
lf anyone drinks in Pondicherry
it's not a crime.

2229
02:28:23,794 --> 02:28:25,694
But, if he comes to nearby
Cuddalore, it's a crime.

2230
02:28:26,797 --> 02:28:29,265
Prostitution is legal in
Mumbai according to law.

2231
02:28:30,468 --> 02:28:31,594
The same thing is illegal here.

2232
02:28:32,970 --> 02:28:34,597
A law for each caste & state.

2233
02:28:35,473 --> 02:28:35,996
Forget about all that.

2234
02:28:37,308 --> 02:28:39,435
l've not yet performed
my dead father's last rites.

2235
02:28:40,144 --> 02:28:43,341
You're asking me not to arrest
his killer. What's this law?

2236
02:28:43,547 --> 02:28:45,606
What's your final decision?
- l'm saying that l'll arrest him.

2237
02:28:45,917 --> 02:28:48,283
l may be forced to stop you
from arresting him,

2238
02:28:48,653 --> 02:28:49,278
Are you threatening me?

2239
02:28:50,154 --> 02:28:51,951
l came into this world
killing five people.

2240
02:28:52,890 --> 02:28:54,619
lf anyone stops me in
discharging my duty.

2241
02:28:55,493 --> 02:28:56,721
l'll kill anyone
& any number of people.

2242
02:28:56,928 --> 02:28:58,452
lf you arrest him.
l'll hack you.

2243
02:29:00,731 --> 02:29:01,459
l'm like wind.

2244
02:29:01,999 --> 02:29:03,694
l'll be omnipresent,
but no one can see me.

2245
02:29:04,068 --> 02:29:06,798
Neither you can see me
nor catch me,

2246
02:29:15,346 --> 02:29:17,644
Hey, Saamy's wife...
- Yes...yes.

2247
02:29:18,182 --> 02:29:18,807
Come quickly.

2248
02:29:48,879 --> 02:29:49,573
Hey, come on boys.

2249
02:29:56,554 --> 02:30:00,012
He has accounted for all the money he
received from you. lncluding interest.

2250
02:30:00,391 --> 02:30:01,517
We can't take any action against him.

2251
02:30:01,892 --> 02:30:02,824
lf possible try to escape.

2252
02:30:03,094 --> 02:30:03,685
Don't disturb us.

2253
02:30:18,743 --> 02:30:20,870
Sir, l'm Annamalai from
Madurai Highway. - Tell me.

2254
02:30:21,078 --> 02:30:22,204
Annachi's car is coming here.

2255
02:30:22,913 --> 02:30:23,538
Don't arrest him.

2256
02:30:26,083 --> 02:30:26,879
But don't allow him to
leave the district.

2257
02:30:28,753 --> 02:30:30,550
Hey turn the car...turn it.

2258
02:30:33,491 --> 02:30:34,890
Good morning sir. - Okay Babu.

2259
02:30:35,092 --> 02:30:36,719
Though you've arrest warrant
against Perumal Pitchai,

2260
02:30:36,927 --> 02:30:37,825
Why didn't you arrest him till now?

2261
02:30:38,029 --> 02:30:39,257
Can you arrest him or not?

2262
02:30:39,597 --> 02:30:40,256
What're we supposed to report?

2263
02:30:40,598 --> 02:30:41,724
Tirunelveli is eagerly waiting.

2264
02:30:42,199 --> 02:30:43,564
We must take out today's evening
paper with this news.

2265
02:30:43,768 --> 02:30:44,234
What shall we publish?

2266
02:30:44,502 --> 02:30:46,470
Publish, ''Perumal Pitchai is absconding,
police are on his trail.''

2267
02:30:46,670 --> 02:30:47,637
Then, can't you catch him?

2268
02:30:49,940 --> 02:30:50,599
''Malai Murasu''

2269
02:30:54,645 --> 02:30:56,909
PERUMAL PlTCHAl lS ABSCONDlNG.

2270
02:30:59,283 --> 02:31:01,251
Sir, post mortem is over.
We can take the body.

2271
02:31:04,121 --> 02:31:06,089
l'll light his pyre only after
arresting Perumal Pitchai.

2272
02:31:07,792 --> 02:31:08,656
Till then, let it be here.

2273
02:31:15,466 --> 02:31:16,330
This is government pistol.

2274
02:31:16,634 --> 02:31:18,602
lf there's any trouble, use it.
l'll say that l fired. - For you?

2275
02:31:19,136 --> 02:31:20,933
l've...an illegal pistol.

2276
02:31:21,372 --> 02:31:23,499
Paramasivam, stay here.

2277
02:31:34,218 --> 02:31:36,049
Sir, Annachi has changed his car.

2278
02:31:36,654 --> 02:31:37,211
l'll take care.

2279
02:31:57,842 --> 02:31:59,810
Sir, l'm Babu from Tuticorin Road.
- Tell me.

2280
02:32:00,010 --> 02:32:02,308
As suggested by you, l've diverted
Annachi on the other route.

2281
02:32:07,184 --> 02:32:10,483
Annachi, DC is waiting there with
firing orders. Please, go back.

2282
02:32:11,689 --> 02:32:12,815
Turn back.

2283
02:32:14,024 --> 02:32:14,683
Go quickly.

2284
02:32:15,025 --> 02:32:16,788
Tell me. - l've forced Annachi's
car to turn back.

2285
02:32:17,027 --> 02:32:18,654
l can't go out of
Tirunelveli district.

2286
02:32:19,029 --> 02:32:20,291
l'll go to my sand quarry.

2287
02:32:20,698 --> 02:32:22,165
You go underground.
- Okay, brother.

2288
02:32:23,434 --> 02:32:25,493
Sir, his car is entering sand quarry.

2289
02:32:26,070 --> 02:32:26,661
Okay, l'll take care.

2290
02:36:19,269 --> 02:36:22,898
Come man...come.
Arrest me...arrest me.

2291
02:36:23,640 --> 02:36:26,404
lf you arrest, you'll vanish without a trace.

2292
02:36:26,944 --> 02:36:28,935
Entire Tirunelveli will burn.

2293
02:36:30,180 --> 02:36:33,741
lf l'm in trouble, C.M. will
make a call, the next moment.

2294
02:36:34,284 --> 02:36:36,377
Next moment l'll be out.

02:36:42,459 --> 02:36:44,086
l'll exterminate your entire clan.

2298
02:36:44,461 --> 02:36:45,428
l'll not spare anyone.

2299
02:36:46,463 --> 02:36:48,931
You're safe till l'm not arrested.

2300
02:36:49,299 --> 02:36:52,325
lf you're bent upon arresting me...
Then, go ahead. Arrest me.

2301
02:36:52,803 --> 02:36:54,270
Who said l'm going to arrest you?

2302
02:36:55,305 --> 02:36:57,796
Tirunelveli will go up in flames.
l'll get a call from CM.

2303
02:36:58,642 --> 02:37:00,109
Poor innocent public
will be affected.

2304
02:37:01,945 --> 02:37:03,105
You'll exterminate my entire clan.

2305
02:37:03,547 --> 02:37:04,275
Do l need all this?

2306
02:37:04,815 --> 02:37:06,339
You said you read 20 papers everyday.

2307
02:37:07,284 --> 02:37:08,114
Did you see today's paper?

2308
02:37:09,386 --> 02:37:12,480
''Perumal Pitchai is Absconding.
Police are on his trail''

2309
02:37:13,657 --> 02:37:16,956
Why should l be afraid of you & run?
lf you've guts, arrest me.

2310
02:37:17,327 --> 02:37:19,795
Arrest me, l say.

2311
02:37:19,997 --> 02:37:22,124
lf l arrest you, it'll be
a problem for people.

2312
02:37:23,267 --> 02:37:24,791
lf you're killed, they'll make you
a patriot & put up your statue.

2313
02:37:25,169 --> 02:37:26,898
And scores of Perumal Pitchais
will generate from under it.

2314
02:37:28,172 --> 02:37:31,107
Tirunelveli would be agog
with your absconding news.

2315
02:37:32,743 --> 02:37:34,472
Let you be an absconder
all your life.

2316
02:37:35,412 --> 02:37:37,744
Let police hunt you eternally.

2317
02:37:38,849 --> 02:37:39,816
But, you'll never be found.

2318
02:37:43,187 --> 02:37:46,987
lt must be recorded that you
got scared of me & absconded.

2319
02:37:48,192 --> 02:37:49,819
Do legally whatever
you want to do.

2320
02:37:50,727 --> 02:37:51,989
You can only destroy.

2321
02:37:53,197 --> 02:37:54,323
l can create.

2322
02:37:55,332 --> 02:37:56,162
l can protect.

2323
02:38:01,705 --> 02:38:02,603
And l can destroy too.

2324
02:38:55,759 --> 02:38:58,227
Saamy's hunt will go on....
