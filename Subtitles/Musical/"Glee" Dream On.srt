1
00:00:18,074 --> 00:00:20,008
<i>that was important.
I need applause to live.</i>

2
00:00:20,076 --> 00:00:21,610
<i>But then Finn introduced her
to a friend who showed her</i>

3
00:00:21,677 --> 00:00:23,512
<i>that there's a lot worse things
to lose than your voice.</i>

4
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:26,410
<i>- I compensate with humor.
- And that's what you missed
on Glee.</i>

5
00:00:28,217 --> 00:00:30,318
{bell ringing}
Hey, you wanted to see me?

6
00:00:30,386 --> 00:00:33,155
William, there's someone
I'd like to introduce you to.

7
00:00:33,222 --> 00:00:34,289
He's the newest member

8
00:00:34,357 --> 00:00:35,390
of our school board.

9
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,526
And he'd like
to speak to you.

10
00:00:37,593 --> 00:00:40,529
Will Schuester,
meet Mr. Bryan Ryan.

11
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:44,800
We've met.

12
00:00:44,867 --> 00:00:44,933
<i>WILL:
Bryan Ryan.</i>

13
00:00:47,136 --> 00:00:49,771
<i>We went to school together, and
he made my life a living hell.</i>

14
00:00:49,839 --> 00:00:50,906
<i>He was two years older.</i>

15
00:00:50,973 --> 00:00:52,941
<i>Dated every girl I liked.</i>

16
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:54,476
<i>Got every solo.</i>

17
00:00:54,544 --> 00:00:58,413
<i>¶¶ Cheer up, Sleepy Jean ¶¶</i>

18
00:00:58,481 --> 00:01:01,349
<i>¶¶ Oh, what can it mean? ¶¶</i>

19
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:04,553
<i>¶¶ To a daydream believer ¶¶</i>

20
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:11,159
<i>¶¶ And a homecoming queen... ¶¶</i>

21
00:01:11,227 --> 00:01:13,829
What's the matter, Schuester,
cat got your talent?

22
00:01:13,896 --> 00:01:15,297
{forced chuckle}

23
00:01:15,364 --> 00:01:17,766
I'm here to do an audit
of our curriculum, Will.

24
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:19,501
We may need to cut
some of our district's

25
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:21,369
art programs.
It's really just

26
00:01:21,437 --> 00:01:22,804
a formality, William.

27
00:01:22,872 --> 00:01:24,506
No, it's not. We'll
probably cut the glee club.

28
00:01:24,574 --> 00:01:25,874
What?!

29
00:01:25,942 --> 00:01:27,409
But-but you were
in the glee club.

30
00:01:27,477 --> 00:01:28,777
Show choir was your life.

31
00:01:28,845 --> 00:01:30,479
It was, Will.

32
00:01:30,546 --> 00:01:33,348
And after I graduated,
I hit the big time.

33
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:34,950
I was a featured soloist

34
00:01:35,017 --> 00:01:37,786
<i>at King's Island in The
Dooble-Dee-Doo Musical Revue.</i>

35
00:01:37,854 --> 00:01:39,221
We were a smash.

36
00:01:39,288 --> 00:01:40,956
Then for
three years,

37
00:01:41,023 --> 00:01:42,691
I did the cruise
ship circuit.

38
00:01:42,758 --> 00:01:44,025
But when that dried up,

39
00:01:44,093 --> 00:01:45,894
I realized I had been sold
a bill of goods.

40
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:48,697
Nine years later,

41
00:01:48,764 --> 00:01:50,999
I woke up
on a urine-stained mattress

42
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:52,601
in the West Lima crack district.

43
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:54,870
Then...

44
00:01:54,937 --> 00:01:57,506
something amazing happened.

45
00:01:57,573 --> 00:02:00,008
I was introduced to Jesus.

46
00:02:00,076 --> 00:02:02,177
He was my Honduran
social worker.

47
00:02:02,245 --> 00:02:03,445
I straightened up,

48
00:02:03,513 --> 00:02:04,746
put down the pipe,

49
00:02:04,814 --> 00:02:07,148
met the love of my life, Wilma,

50
00:02:07,216 --> 00:02:09,551
and now I run a successful
used Hummer dealership.

51
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:10,785
Don't make
that face.

52
00:02:10,853 --> 00:02:12,888
Global warming's a theory.

53
00:02:12,955 --> 00:02:14,022
{exhales}

54
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,624
And four nights a week,

55
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:18,193
I run
a show choir conversion group.

56
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:19,961
Hi, I'm Brenda.

57
00:02:20,029 --> 00:02:23,698
And it's been 42 days
since I sang a show tune.

58
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:25,200
GROUP:
Hi, Brenda.

59
00:02:25,268 --> 00:02:27,235
Years ago when I
auditioned to play

60
00:02:27,303 --> 00:02:29,371
<i>Miss Adelaide
in Guys and Dolls,</i>

61
00:02:29,438 --> 00:02:31,940
I was asked
to take my top off.

62
00:02:32,008 --> 00:02:35,310
Evidently, that is
not... customary.

63
00:02:35,378 --> 00:02:39,748
And... that's when I
started huffing glue.

64
00:02:39,815 --> 00:02:42,617
My name is Russell;
I'm a glee club survivor.

65
00:02:42,685 --> 00:02:44,319
Whenever anything
bad would happen,

66
00:02:44,387 --> 00:02:46,955
I would just say,
"Let's put on a show."

67
00:02:47,023 --> 00:02:48,323
Well, guess what?

68
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:50,358
"Puttin' on a show!"

69
00:02:50,426 --> 00:02:52,827
about your father's
prostate cancer

70
00:02:52,895 --> 00:02:54,663
{voice cracking}:
will actually just make
him more depressed

71
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,764
about the situation.

72
00:02:55,831 --> 00:02:58,166
Show choir kills.

73
00:02:58,234 --> 00:03:00,468
I just want to have
a talk with your kids.

74
00:03:00,536 --> 00:03:02,571
Make sure you're not
building up their hopes

75
00:03:02,638 --> 00:03:04,039
just to have them knocked down.

76
00:03:04,106 --> 00:03:06,074
What if I say no?

77
00:03:06,142 --> 00:03:09,644
Just let him speak
to the kids, William.

78
00:03:09,712 --> 00:03:13,381
Let Mr. Bryan Ryan contribute
to the marketplace of ideas.

79
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:14,883
What's the worst
that can happen?

80
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:17,218
<i>WILL:
Okay, guys, listen up.</i>

81
00:03:17,286 --> 00:03:18,553
This is Mr. Ryan.

82
00:03:18,621 --> 00:03:19,988
He's a member
of the school board,

83
00:03:20,056 --> 00:03:22,490
and he would like
to say a few words.

84
00:03:22,558 --> 00:03:25,860
I-I just want you guys
to listen critically

85
00:03:25,928 --> 00:03:27,462
and know that
what he's saying

86
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,864
is just one of
many opinions.

87
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:32,601
Take out a piece of paper.

88
00:03:32,668 --> 00:03:36,738
And on that paper,
I want you to write down

89
00:03:36,806 --> 00:03:37,872
your biggest dream.

90
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,008
A dream that means so much,

91
00:03:40,076 --> 00:03:43,511
you're afraid to admit it
even to yourself.

92
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:52,921
Your dream
is never going to happen.

93
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:54,990
91% of you

94
00:03:55,057 --> 00:03:58,760
will spend your entire lives
living in Allen County, Ohio.

95
00:03:58,828 --> 00:04:00,996
So unless you wrote down
that your dream was

96
00:04:01,063 --> 00:04:03,765
to "work for a mid-market
health insurance provider"

97
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:07,268
or "find an entry level job
in an elderly care facility,"

98
00:04:07,336 --> 00:04:08,837
you're going to be
very disappointed.

99
00:04:08,904 --> 00:04:11,573
This is really depressing.

100
00:04:11,641 --> 00:04:14,376
I'm going to guess that
a lot of your dreams

101
00:04:14,443 --> 00:04:15,410
involve "showbiz."

102
00:04:15,478 --> 00:04:17,345
Well, let me tell you.

103
00:04:17,413 --> 00:04:21,182
Showbiz dreams are the most
unrealistic of them all.

104
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,252
But... that's what I want
to do with my life.

105
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,355
Oh, look, I'm not trying
to hurt your feelings,

106
00:04:27,423 --> 00:04:30,925
I'm just trying to spare you
disappointment.

107
00:04:30,993 --> 00:04:32,227
I think we get your point.

108
00:04:32,294 --> 00:04:36,498
Aw, well, Schuester here's
a prime example.

109
00:04:36,565 --> 00:04:38,967
He used to have that glimmer
of hope in his eyes

110
00:04:39,035 --> 00:04:41,503
that I can see right now
in all of yours.

111
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,173
But he couldn't make it happen
for himself,

112
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:48,576
so he now has to try
and convince you all

113
00:04:48,644 --> 00:04:49,978
that it will happen
for you.

114
00:04:50,046 --> 00:04:51,046
Guess what?

115
00:04:51,113 --> 00:04:52,514
His dream didn't work out.

116
00:04:54,283 --> 00:04:56,885
And neither will yours.

117
00:04:56,952 --> 00:04:58,019
{sobbing}

118
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:03,024
Okay, you're done here.

119
00:05:03,092 --> 00:05:05,126
You would be wise
to show me some respect.

120
00:05:05,194 --> 00:05:06,795
You've said your piece.

121
00:05:06,862 --> 00:05:08,897
Now get out.

122
00:05:08,964 --> 00:05:13,201
Well, Schuester,
I should thank you.

123
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:15,503
You've made my decision
about which program to cut

124
00:05:15,571 --> 00:05:17,472
a lot easier.

125
00:05:23,713 --> 00:05:25,814
{bell ringing}

126
00:05:27,783 --> 00:05:29,184
Thanks.

127
00:05:29,251 --> 00:05:31,453
<i>Godard on Godard?</i>

128
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,390
He was the master
of the French New Wave.

129
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:39,060
I was figuring that since I'm
never going to become a star

130
00:05:39,128 --> 00:05:44,332
as a performer, maybe I could
become one behind the camera.

131
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,034
Did you know Christopher
Reeve directed a movie

132
00:05:46,102 --> 00:05:47,502
<i>after his accident?
In the Gloaming.</i>

133
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,636
Didn't see it.

134
00:05:48,704 --> 00:05:50,572
Oh, me neither. Too depressing.

135
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,041
Is that what you
wrote as your dream?

136
00:05:53,109 --> 00:05:56,177
Before Bryan Ryan crumpled it up
and tossed it in the trash?

137
00:05:56,245 --> 00:05:57,512
Yes.

138
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,013
Why are you lying to me?

139
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:01,549
<i>After everybody left,</i>

140
00:06:01,617 --> 00:06:03,017
<i>I went back for my book bag</i>

141
00:06:03,085 --> 00:06:04,319
<i>and something stopped me.</i>

142
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:08,289
That was supposed to be private.

143
00:06:08,357 --> 00:06:09,858
I don't understand you.

144
00:06:09,925 --> 00:06:12,660
You're always talking about
wanting to get with me,

145
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:15,163
but you won't be honest
with me about your
hopes and dreams.

146
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:18,032
I'm in a wheelchair,
but I'm still a guy.

147
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,267
What's the difference?

148
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:21,369
I'm never going to
actually become a dancer.

149
00:06:21,437 --> 00:06:23,772
My legs are never
going to work again.

150
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,206
It was stupid.

151
00:06:27,877 --> 00:06:29,944
I was thinking--

152
00:06:30,012 --> 00:06:32,313
Mr. Shue is so busy
dealing with Bryan Ryan

153
00:06:32,381 --> 00:06:34,415
that he didn't give
us an assignment
for the week.

154
00:06:34,483 --> 00:06:37,185
So, why don't we do
one on our own.

155
00:06:37,253 --> 00:06:38,787
A dance number.

156
00:06:38,854 --> 00:06:41,489
You want to dance with me?

157
00:06:41,557 --> 00:06:44,192
You were pretty hot
in "Proud Mary."

158
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,561
Why don't we try and
kick it up a few notches.

159
00:06:58,474 --> 00:07:00,441
Hi.

160
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,944
Hi.

161
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:05,680
How was your
spring break?

162
00:07:05,748 --> 00:07:09,083
Good.

163
00:07:09,151 --> 00:07:11,119
It's good to be back.

164
00:07:14,824 --> 00:07:16,291
What were you just rehearsing?

165
00:07:16,358 --> 00:07:22,163
A guy came to Glee Club to talk
to us about dreams.

166
00:07:22,231 --> 00:07:23,665
Luckily, I've known mine
since I was four.

167
00:07:23,732 --> 00:07:25,366
I'm going to play three
parts on Broadway--

168
00:07:25,434 --> 00:07:28,036
<i>Evita, Funny Girl
and Laurey in Oklahoma.</i>

169
00:07:28,103 --> 00:07:30,471
I was just practicing her
dream ballet with Curly.

170
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,607
It's what I do when I'm feeling
a little stressed.

171
00:07:32,675 --> 00:07:34,108
That's not a dream.

172
00:07:34,176 --> 00:07:37,011
A dream is something that
fills up the emptiness inside.

173
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,780
The one thing that you
know if it came true,

174
00:07:38,848 --> 00:07:40,682
all the hurt would go away.

175
00:07:40,749 --> 00:07:42,717
You singing, "Don't
Cry For Me Argentina,"

176
00:07:42,785 --> 00:07:45,220
in front of a sold-out
crowd, isn't a fantasy.

177
00:07:45,287 --> 00:07:47,655
It's an inevitability.

178
00:07:47,723 --> 00:07:49,224
{chuckles}

179
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,398
I thought you'd
never come back.

180
00:07:57,466 --> 00:07:59,434
And miss all your drama?

181
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:01,002
Never.

182
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,737
{bell ringing}

183
00:08:02,805 --> 00:08:05,139
So what is it, your dream?

184
00:08:05,207 --> 00:08:07,508
I don't know.

185
00:08:07,576 --> 00:08:10,645
Well, then go inside, find it
and ask it what it's gonna take.

186
00:08:10,713 --> 00:08:13,715
Why are you pushing this?

187
00:08:13,782 --> 00:08:15,617
Because you're
my girlfriend,

188
00:08:15,684 --> 00:08:17,719
and I want to know
all your secrets.

189
00:08:17,786 --> 00:08:19,654
When you lie awake
at night, what's missing?

190
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,624
My mom.

191
00:08:22,691 --> 00:08:23,958
Your mom?

192
00:08:24,026 --> 00:08:26,327
You mean like you
want to meet her?

193
00:08:26,395 --> 00:08:30,465
I just would like
to know who she is.

194
00:08:30,532 --> 00:08:32,433
I don't really need
to meet her or anything,

195
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:36,938
but maybe just find out her name
or... something about her.

196
00:08:37,006 --> 00:08:38,439
Hmm.

197
00:08:38,507 --> 00:08:40,675
It's silly.

198
00:08:40,743 --> 00:08:42,677
It's not like it's going
to happen or anything.

199
00:08:42,745 --> 00:08:44,145
Why?

200
00:08:44,213 --> 00:08:46,047
Well, just because my dad
never told me anything,

201
00:08:46,115 --> 00:08:47,649
and I didn't want
to ask them anything

202
00:08:47,716 --> 00:08:50,184
'cause I didn't want
to hurt their feelings.

203
00:08:50,252 --> 00:08:52,253
So let's check it out
without them knowing.

204
00:08:52,321 --> 00:08:54,422
Do you know why I
came back to school here?

205
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,723
To win another
national title

206
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,192
and make all your
dreams come true.

207
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,394
If this is one of them,

208
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:01,930
then I'm not going to
stop until it happens.

209
00:09:03,766 --> 00:09:05,867
{piano playing lively tune}

210
00:09:09,939 --> 00:09:12,040
{wheels make tap shoe-like
tapping sound}

211
00:09:25,821 --> 00:09:28,489
{boombox beeps, shuts off}

212
00:09:28,557 --> 00:09:30,558
My tap wheels suck.

213
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:32,226
I thought
we sounded pretty good.

214
00:09:32,294 --> 00:09:33,594
<i>You did.</i>

215
00:09:33,662 --> 00:09:36,397
I sound like someone
put tap shoes on a horse

216
00:09:36,465 --> 00:09:37,432
and then shot it.

217
00:09:37,499 --> 00:09:38,733
Will you bring me those?

218
00:09:42,004 --> 00:09:44,372
I borrowed them
from John Hubner.

219
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,873
The kid with cerebral palsy?

220
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:47,675
They're his extra pair.

221
00:09:47,743 --> 00:09:49,677
Help me get up on them.

222
00:09:49,745 --> 00:09:51,846
Have you ever used
anything like these before?

223
00:09:51,914 --> 00:09:55,149
No, but I have superhuman
upper body strength

224
00:09:55,217 --> 00:09:56,351
from using my wheelchair.

225
00:09:56,418 --> 00:09:58,086
If I can just get up,

226
00:09:58,153 --> 00:10:00,388
I think I can use my arms
to get around the room.

227
00:10:02,091 --> 00:10:03,424
Come on. You said

228
00:10:03,492 --> 00:10:05,426
we were going to
kick it up a notch.

229
00:10:05,494 --> 00:10:07,428
Dreams aren't
supposed to be easy.

230
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,039
I'm going to try
to take a step.

231
00:10:18,107 --> 00:10:19,507
Okay.

232
00:10:22,644 --> 00:10:24,812
You're doing it.

233
00:10:29,485 --> 00:10:31,486
Are you okay?

234
00:10:31,553 --> 00:10:33,354
Go away.

235
00:10:33,422 --> 00:10:35,256
Let me bring
your chair over.

236
00:10:35,324 --> 00:10:37,492
Just go... away.

237
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:39,160
You shouldn't have
done this to me.

238
00:10:39,228 --> 00:10:40,495
You pushed me
to do this.

239
00:10:40,562 --> 00:10:43,564
I'm sorry.

240
00:10:43,632 --> 00:10:45,299
Just go away, please.

241
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:46,868
{sniffles}

242
00:10:52,508 --> 00:10:54,375
{bell ringing}

243
00:10:55,544 --> 00:10:56,811
Hey, Bryan.

244
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,112
Hello, Will.

245
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,781
Just taking stock of
the home ec supplies.

246
00:10:59,848 --> 00:11:01,282
You see, our
home ec program

247
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:05,486
teaches practical skills
like food service preparation.

248
00:11:05,554 --> 00:11:06,921
Can't feed a child
sheet music, Will.

249
00:11:06,989 --> 00:11:09,257
I mean, I suppose you
could for a while, but...

250
00:11:09,324 --> 00:11:10,758
they'd be dead in a month.

251
00:11:10,826 --> 00:11:12,126
I'd like to buy you a beer.

252
00:11:12,194 --> 00:11:13,061
Oh.

253
00:11:13,128 --> 00:11:14,395
No, no.

254
00:11:14,463 --> 00:11:16,664
I want to convince you
that you're wrong.

255
00:11:16,732 --> 00:11:17,765
You won't.

256
00:11:19,968 --> 00:11:22,637
Then... for old times' sake?

257
00:11:31,116 --> 00:11:32,083
I found her.

258
00:11:32,151 --> 00:11:33,851
Your mother? Where?

259
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,019
In the library.

260
00:11:37,256 --> 00:11:39,690
I've been researching her all
morning, and as I suspected,

261
00:11:39,758 --> 00:11:41,559
my intuition has
been proven correct.

262
00:11:41,627 --> 00:11:44,128
My mother is Broadway legend
Patti Lupone.

263
00:11:45,731 --> 00:11:47,098
<i>I've always had
a deep connection</i>

264
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,233
<i>to Ms. Lupone--
her choice of roles and songs.</i>

265
00:11:49,301 --> 00:11:51,035
<i>I decided to do a little math</i>

266
00:11:51,103 --> 00:11:53,304
<i>to see if her being my mother
was even possible.</i>

267
00:11:53,372 --> 00:11:56,140
<i>I was born December 18, 1994.</i>

268
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,876
<i>1994 was a big year for Mother.</i>

269
00:11:58,944 --> 00:12:00,511
<i>She was a sensation
in Pal Joey.</i>

270
00:12:00,579 --> 00:12:03,548
<i>But that was in New York;
I was born in Ohio, you say.</i>

271
00:12:03,615 --> 00:12:05,416
<i>Well, Mother took many breaks</i>

272
00:12:05,484 --> 00:12:07,385
<i>from the show to tour
with Mandy Patinkin.</i>

273
00:12:07,452 --> 00:12:09,487
<i>That April found them
at the EJ Thomas Hall</i>

274
00:12:09,555 --> 00:12:12,223
<i>in Akron, Ohio, for
a standing room performance--</i>

275
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,724
<i>nine months before I was born.</i>

276
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:16,194
Are you saying that your fathers
impregnated Patti LuPone

277
00:12:16,261 --> 00:12:17,562
in the Marriott
in Akron?

278
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:18,829
Was Mandy Patinkin
in on this?

279
00:12:18,897 --> 00:12:21,332
All you have to do is
look at pictures of her

280
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,467
<i>in her performance
in Master Class in 1996.</i>

281
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:26,804
Look at the pain in her eyes
and the hurt she's feeling

282
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:28,773
from giving up her obviously
talented little girl.

283
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,142
One question:
What was in it for her?

284
00:12:32,644 --> 00:12:35,379
M-Money, a sense of charity
for those in need?

285
00:12:37,783 --> 00:12:40,084
I don't know.

286
00:12:40,152 --> 00:12:42,019
Guess you're right.

287
00:12:42,087 --> 00:12:43,821
Do you want to hear my research

288
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,890
that proves that my mother
is Bernadette Peters?

289
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,825
Why are you so afraid
about finding the truth?

290
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:50,728
I don't know, I guess
I just don't want to think

291
00:12:50,796 --> 00:12:53,197
that my mother is some
teenage trollop like Quinn,

292
00:12:53,265 --> 00:12:56,000
or worse, some skanky girl
who would do anything for money,

293
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:57,802
including giving me up.
Why does it

294
00:12:57,869 --> 00:12:59,303
have to be one
of those choices?

295
00:12:59,371 --> 00:13:02,039
Maybe she had a really good
reason for doing what she did.

296
00:13:02,107 --> 00:13:04,008
We need to do a
real investigation.

297
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:05,643
Like, CSI real.

298
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:06,677
Do you have

299
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:07,845
any baby stuff in your house,

300
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:09,080
something that might
give us a clue?

301
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:10,881
My fathers kept
every piece of paper

302
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:13,517
related to my life in files
and cabinets in our basement.

303
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,286
It's sort of
a little Rachel Berry museum.

304
00:13:15,354 --> 00:13:17,054
Perfect.

305
00:13:17,122 --> 00:13:18,356
We'll start there.

306
00:13:21,226 --> 00:13:23,327
WILL:
You were a big deal
at McKinley.

307
00:13:23,395 --> 00:13:25,997
{"Dream Weaver" by Gary Wright
playing quietly}

308
00:13:26,064 --> 00:13:27,465
You had all
the moves...

309
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:30,234
You were one
of those dudes

310
00:13:30,302 --> 00:13:31,969
where all the guys
wanted to be you

311
00:13:32,037 --> 00:13:33,204
and all the girls
wanted you.

312
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:35,039
Not all of them.

313
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:36,374
Really?

314
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,309
All right, wh-who was
the one that got away?

315
00:13:38,377 --> 00:13:40,144
Terri Delmonico.

316
00:13:40,212 --> 00:13:41,178
You remember her?

317
00:13:41,246 --> 00:13:44,181
{coughing}

318
00:13:44,249 --> 00:13:45,283
Yeah.

319
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,717
Yeah, she was,
she was cool.

320
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:47,885
Oh...

321
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:50,354
I married her.
No way.

322
00:13:50,422 --> 00:13:51,889
Yeah.

323
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:53,591
It didn't really
work out though.

324
00:13:53,659 --> 00:13:56,060
Wow. I'm sorry to hear that.

325
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:57,128
She was great.

326
00:13:57,195 --> 00:13:58,462
I-I really loved her,

327
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,632
and, you know, just...
just grew apart.

328
00:14:03,201 --> 00:14:05,703
Do you know what gave
me the strength to...

329
00:14:05,771 --> 00:14:07,672
finally get out of a
terrible marriage?

330
00:14:09,574 --> 00:14:11,542
Music.

331
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,843

Coaching Glee Club.

333
00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:16,514
No, you're right.

334
00:14:16,581 --> 00:14:19,083
I-I'm... I'm never
going to be on Broadway.

335
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:21,919
And maybe the same is going to
go for most of those kids.

336
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:23,321
But that's
not the point.

337
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:25,923
Glee Club--

338
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:27,458
it's not just about
expressing yourself

339
00:14:27,526 --> 00:14:31,295
to everyone else.

340
00:14:31,363 --> 00:14:33,164
It's about expressing
yourself to yourself.

341
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,268
I'm living a lie.

342
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:38,769
What?

343
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:41,872
{sniffles}
I miss it so much!

344
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,542
I am miserable.

345
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:48,112
Ever since I stopped performing,
I cannot stand my life!

Three times a year,
I tell my wife

00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:54,085
I'm going off to a business
trip, I sneak out to New York,

348
00:14:54,152 --> 00:14:55,286
I see a bunch of
Broadway shows.

357
00:15:14,072 --> 00:15:15,005
You remember?

358
00:15:15,073 --> 00:15:16,173
Sectionals, 1992.

359
00:15:16,241 --> 00:15:17,375
You sang this song

360
00:15:17,442 --> 00:15:19,110
alone on stage, just
you and a piano.

361
00:15:19,177 --> 00:15:20,911
I mean, I... I know this
isn't quite as theatrical,

362
00:15:20,979 --> 00:15:22,446
but you're gonna sing
it again right now.

363
00:15:22,514 --> 00:15:23,481
I can't.

364
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:26,751
Yes, you can.

381
00:16:34,152 --> 00:16:36,654
You've got to give it
another shot.

382
00:16:36,721 --> 00:16:39,323
<i>Lima Theatre Guild is doing
a production of Les Miz.</i>

383
00:16:39,391 --> 00:16:41,358
Auditions are Friday,

384
00:16:41,426 --> 00:16:44,995
and both of us
are trying out.

385
00:16:45,063 --> 00:16:47,064
All right? Oh, oh, okay.

386
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,086
Hey.

387
00:16:53,154 --> 00:16:55,689
Sorry about yesterday.

388
00:16:55,757 --> 00:16:58,158
No, I'm sorry.

389
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,494
I do a pretty good job
of being in denial

390
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,963
about the hopelessness
of my condition.

391
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,165
I think I just
kind of freaked out

392
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,867
when I actually
had to face it.

393
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:08,535
Who says it's
hopeless?

394
00:17:08,603 --> 00:17:10,771
Like, every doctor
I've ever seen.

395
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,574
Maybe they're the wrong doctors.

396
00:17:14,642 --> 00:17:16,743
I went online and did
some research about

397
00:17:16,811 --> 00:17:18,478
the new treatments
on spinal cord injuries.

398
00:17:18,546 --> 00:17:20,447
Did you know that some
doctors are implanting

399
00:17:20,515 --> 00:17:22,382
electrical stimulators
in patients' bodies

400
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,984
to recover hand
movements?

401
00:17:24,051 --> 00:17:25,552
My hands work.

402
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,487
They're just starting to
develop the technology.

403
00:17:27,555 --> 00:17:30,624
But in a year, five
years, who knows?

404
00:17:30,691 --> 00:17:33,493
And some scientists at UC
San Diego were actually able

405
00:17:33,561 --> 00:17:35,796
to regenerate a rat's
damaged spinal cord.

406
00:17:35,863 --> 00:17:37,030
There are hundreds
of studies

407
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,899
going on right now
using stem cells.

408
00:17:41,235 --> 00:17:43,470
I guess I just
wanted to tell you

409
00:17:43,538 --> 00:17:45,038
not to give up
on your dream.

410
00:17:46,073 --> 00:17:47,674
If you can imagine it,

411
00:17:47,742 --> 00:17:48,875
it can come true.

412
00:18:01,255 --> 00:18:03,089
What took you so long?

413
00:18:03,157 --> 00:18:04,524
Your dads will
be home soon.

414
00:18:04,592 --> 00:18:06,726
There was so much
stuff in the basement,

415
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,195
it's like a shrine.

416
00:18:08,262 --> 00:18:10,664
It's creepy and flattering
at the same time.

417
00:18:10,731 --> 00:18:14,100
But these boxes had the
earliest dates on them, so...

418
00:18:14,168 --> 00:18:15,669
{gasps}

419
00:18:15,736 --> 00:18:17,170

420
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,274
Look.

421
00:18:21,342 --> 00:18:22,342
Is that me?

422
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,343
Looks like you.
Oh.

423
00:18:23,411 --> 00:18:24,544
I think you're
in fifth position.

424
00:18:24,612 --> 00:18:26,146
Makes sense. My dad
says they used to

425
00:18:26,214 --> 00:18:28,515
play Vivaldi into
my mother's belly.

426
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:29,783
Put that there.

427
00:18:29,851 --> 00:18:30,884
{gasps}

428
00:18:30,952 --> 00:18:33,153
My first singing
competition.

429
00:18:33,221 --> 00:18:34,321
I came in
first place.

430
00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:35,522
You were eight months old.

431
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,123
I was very musically verbal.

432
00:18:37,191 --> 00:18:38,992
Cute little
baby shoes.

433
00:18:47,635 --> 00:18:50,070
What's this?

434
00:18:50,137 --> 00:18:51,905
"From Mother to Daughter."

435
00:18:54,108 --> 00:18:57,410
Oh, my God, she wrote this.

436
00:18:57,478 --> 00:18:59,312
She held this in her hand.

437
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,414
Wh-What are you doing?

438
00:19:01,482 --> 00:19:02,949
Playing the tape.
No!

439
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:04,651
Why not?
She wanted you to hear this.

440
00:19:04,719 --> 00:19:05,886
I-I'm not ready.

441
00:19:05,953 --> 00:19:08,421
Look, this is all
happening too fast.

442
00:19:08,489 --> 00:19:10,023
What if she's singing
on the tape?

443
00:19:10,091 --> 00:19:11,858
What if she's terrible?

444
00:19:11,926 --> 00:19:14,294
Or worse, what if
she's better than me?

445
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,596
I can't believe we're so close
to your dream coming true,

446
00:19:16,664 --> 00:19:17,831
and you're running
away from it.
No.

447
00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:18,832
It's, it's my choice.

448
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,601
It's... it's my life, and...

449
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:23,069
No, I'm-I'm not ready.

450
00:19:23,137 --> 00:19:26,072

that you should go.

Please don't
distract me.

458
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,066
I'm trying out for the
role of Jean Valjean.

459
00:19:53,134 --> 00:19:54,067
So am I.

460
00:19:54,135 --> 00:19:55,335

BRYAN:
What song do you
plan on singing?

463
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,342
I was going to sing
"The Impossible Dream."

464
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,643
Wow, really?
Interesting.

So am I.

But then,

467
00:20:07,114 --> 00:20:08,014
I decided on

468
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,416
Aerosmith's "Dream On."

469
00:20:09,483 --> 00:20:11,318
Yeah, me, too. That's
what I'm gonna sing.

Are you kidding
me right...

00:20:12,486 --> 00:20:13,753
Is there a problem out here?

472
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:15,488
Yeah, there's a problem;
this guy just stole my song!

473
00:20:15,556 --> 00:20:17,724
Uh, I don't know this man.
His caretaker just stepped away.

474
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:19,292
I overheard her mention
he's a sex offender.

475
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,461
Oh, you're gonna need
a caretaker in a second, buddy.

476
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:22,462
I run a dry cleaners.

477

I can't believe
I just bought tap shoes.

Think of them
as an investment

a pretzel?

Hell, yes, woman.

00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,081
They're upstairs.

Do you mind waiting down here

you're buying.

Wait.

I need to tell you something.

524
00:23:38,426 --> 00:23:40,294
I went to the doctor yesterday,

525
00:23:40,362 --> 00:23:42,296
and he started me
on all of the therapies

526
00:23:42,364 --> 00:23:43,397
that you researched for me.

527
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:44,498
Really?

528
00:23:44,566 --> 00:23:47,735
But guess what?

529
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:49,870
They're working.

530
00:24:04,386 --> 00:24:06,420
Oh, my God.

531
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:08,489
Artie, you can walk!

532
00:24:08,556 --> 00:24:10,724
I've spent so many years
dreaming about what I'd do

533
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:12,493
if I could get up
out of the chair.

534
00:24:13,595 --> 00:24:16,063
And now that I can,

535
00:24:16,131 --> 00:24:19,867
all I want to do is... dance.

536
00:24:19,935 --> 00:24:22,569
{techno-pop playing}

537
00:24:24,873 --> 00:24:26,273

¶¶ 'Cause your friends
don't dance ¶¶

547

¶¶ And if they don't dance, well,
they're no friends of mine ¶¶

548
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:45,693
¶¶ I say we can go
where we want to ¶¶

549

550

¶¶ And we can act like we come
from out of this world ¶¶

551
00:24:50,465 --> 00:24:52,700

559
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,925

560
00:25:17,993 --> 00:25:19,927

like an imbecile ¶¶

561

DANCERS:

00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:27,394
¶¶ With the Safety Dance ¶¶

00:26:30,331 --> 00:26:32,266

it's Safety Dance ¶¶

587
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:38,038
¶¶ It's Safety Dance. ¶¶

588
00:26:38,106 --> 00:26:39,139
{song ends}

589
00:26:46,548 --> 00:26:48,148
You okay?

590
00:26:50,552 --> 00:26:52,786
I'm gonna dance one day,
you know.

591
00:26:52,854 --> 00:26:54,621
I know you are.

592
00:26:54,689 --> 00:26:57,391
I thought you were gonna take
a hatchet to that Glee Club.

593
00:26:57,459 --> 00:27:00,194
I was,
but you may have heard,

594
00:27:00,261 --> 00:27:03,697
I plan on making my return
to the stage next month

595
00:27:03,765 --> 00:27:05,399
<i>in a local production
of Les Miz,</i>

596
00:27:05,467 --> 00:27:08,869
and I've had something
of a personal awakening.

597
00:27:08,937 --> 00:27:11,004
So I've decided
to examine all

598
00:27:11,072 --> 00:27:13,273
of the extracurricular
activities here at this school,

599
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:17,177
and Sue, your Cheerios!
budget is out of control.

600
00:27:17,245 --> 00:27:19,947
Let me remind you
of something, Mr. Ryan.

601
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:21,281
The Cheerios! sell tickets.

602
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:23,050
Not enough to offset your costs.

603
00:27:23,118 --> 00:27:26,653
I am very tired of athletics
always taking a back seat.

604
00:27:26,721 --> 00:27:28,755
When daily P.E. was cut
at this school,

605
00:27:28,823 --> 00:27:30,190
no one batted an eye.

606
00:27:30,258 --> 00:27:32,092
But cut a dance program,
cancel the school musical,

607
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,760
and suddenly there's an uproar.

608
00:27:33,828 --> 00:27:35,596
I did a little research, Sue.

609
00:27:35,663 --> 00:27:39,433
Did you know that studies have
shown that reading Shakespeare

610
00:27:39,501 --> 00:27:41,368
might help kids learn physics?

611
00:27:41,436 --> 00:27:43,971
That singing helps you
learn pitch,

612
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:46,006
which makes learning
a foreign language easier?

613
00:27:46,074 --> 00:27:48,709
That when a kid picks up
a clarinet or a trumpet,

614
00:27:48,776 --> 00:27:51,745
every region of the cerebral
cortex is stimulated?

615
00:27:51,813 --> 00:27:53,313
Well, that's all
very interesting,

616
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:56,383
but did you know that a third
of American teenagers are obese,

617
00:27:56,451 --> 00:27:58,685
and only 2% of high schools
require any form

618
00:27:58,753 --> 00:28:00,254
of daily physical
activity?

619
00:28:00,321 --> 00:28:02,289
Where is your outrage
about that, Mr. Ryan?

620
00:28:02,357 --> 00:28:04,625
Sports teach kids
how to work together,

621
00:28:04,692 --> 00:28:06,360
teaches problem solving
and social skills,

622
00:28:06,427 --> 00:28:08,595
it improves attendance,
not to mention grades,

623
00:28:08,663 --> 00:28:09,963
particularly among
those students deemed

624
00:28:10,031 --> 00:28:11,098
the most "at risk."

625
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:12,533
You've done your homework.

626
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,800
I'm an educator.

627
00:28:15,603 --> 00:28:17,704
Now, I realize my methods
are unconventional,

628
00:28:17,772 --> 00:28:19,606
but my record speaks for itself.

629
00:28:19,674 --> 00:28:21,608
Is it a tad over
the top to bill

630
00:28:21,676 --> 00:28:23,143
the district
for skydiving lessons

631
00:28:23,211 --> 00:28:25,946
to have the Cheerios! parachuted
onto the football field?

632
00:28:26,014 --> 00:28:27,181
Perhaps.

633
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:29,016
But what I do here
makes a difference.

634
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,018
Sue, you're an impressive woman.

635
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:34,421
I can't tell you how much
you turn me on right now,

636
00:28:34,489 --> 00:28:36,156
You ever heard of the term
"anger sex"?

637
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,691
It's the only kind I know,
Bryan.

638
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,860
I should tell you I'm married.
Not a problem for me.

639
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:41,328
And I'm still cutting
half your budget.

640
00:28:41,396 --> 00:28:42,629
You win some, you lose some.

641
00:28:42,697 --> 00:28:43,830
Should I lock the door?

642
00:28:43,898 --> 00:28:46,667
No. Got a secret room upstairs.

643
00:28:47,702 --> 00:28:48,835
Like Letterman.

644
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:56,764
She has the tape.

645
00:28:56,831 --> 00:28:59,967
She won't listen to it.

646
00:29:00,035 --> 00:29:01,535
What?

647
00:29:01,603 --> 00:29:03,537
<i>She has to listen to it.</i>

648
00:29:03,605 --> 00:29:05,306
That's the point of all this.

649
00:29:05,373 --> 00:29:06,440
I'm doing my best!

650
00:29:06,508 --> 00:29:08,909
Look, when you told me
to seduce her...

651
00:29:08,977 --> 00:29:10,744
"Befriend" her was the word
I used, actually.

652
00:29:10,812 --> 00:29:13,280
Whatever. The thing is,
I was into it

653
00:29:13,348 --> 00:29:15,916
because I thought it would
be a good acting exercise,

654
00:29:15,984 --> 00:29:17,785
but now I think
I kind of like her.

655
00:29:17,852 --> 00:29:19,286
I don't want her to get hurt.

656
00:29:19,354 --> 00:29:21,221
Look, one more week,
this will all be done;

657
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:23,424
you can come back to Vocal
Adrenaline where you belong.

658
00:29:23,491 --> 00:29:25,926
I don't understand why you don't
just go up to her and say,

659
00:29:25,994 --> 00:29:28,329
"Hi, my name's Shelby.
I'm your mom."

660
00:29:28,396 --> 00:29:29,563
I signed a contract.

661
00:29:29,631 --> 00:29:32,433
I can't contact her
until she's 18.

662
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,767
She has to come to me.

663
00:29:33,835 --> 00:29:35,903
That's why she has
to listen to the tape.

664
00:29:35,971 --> 00:29:37,771
Once she hears it,

665
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:41,942
she won't be able to sleep
until she finds me.

666
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,214
I answered an ad
in the paper.

667
00:29:47,282 --> 00:29:49,383
Nine months work here
would make me enough money

668
00:29:49,451 --> 00:29:51,418
to live in New York
for two years.

669
00:29:51,486 --> 00:29:53,454
Her dads seemed
like nice guys,
so I went for it.

670
00:29:55,523 --> 00:29:58,025
I never got to hold her.

671
00:29:59,828 --> 00:30:04,999
And I only saw her for a second
when they were cleaning her off.

672
00:30:05,066 --> 00:30:07,501
It was through
a bunch of nurses,

673
00:30:07,569 --> 00:30:11,505
but she turned her little head,
and she looked at me.

674
00:30:18,046 --> 00:30:20,280
I've failed as an actress.

675
00:30:20,348 --> 00:30:22,049
My walls are lined with trophies

676
00:30:22,117 --> 00:30:24,251
instead of wedding
pictures,

677
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:27,921
but through all of of that...

678
00:30:27,989 --> 00:30:30,324
I only have one regret.

679
00:30:32,394 --> 00:30:34,161
You get her to listen
to that tape.

680
00:30:43,638 --> 00:30:44,805
You know, honestly,

681
00:30:44,873 --> 00:30:46,807
the only students
that come and see me

682
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:48,876
on a scheduled
weekly basis are ones

683
00:30:48,943 --> 00:30:50,010
that have been diagnosed

684
00:30:50,078 --> 00:30:51,545
with psychological disorders,

685
00:30:51,613 --> 00:30:53,680
like a certain junior female
that eats her own hair.

686
00:30:53,748 --> 00:30:55,249
When I start walking,

687
00:30:55,316 --> 00:30:57,051
I'm gonna need help
emotionally adapting

688
00:30:57,118 --> 00:30:58,786
to my drastically
altered lifestyle.

689
00:30:58,853 --> 00:31:01,155
Walking?

690
00:31:01,222 --> 00:31:04,525
There are all these new
therapies for my condition.

691
00:31:04,592 --> 00:31:06,960
I figure if I try them all,
one's bound to work.

692
00:31:09,431 --> 00:31:12,299
Um...

693
00:31:12,367 --> 00:31:14,535
you know, Artie, I have, um...

694
00:31:14,602 --> 00:31:16,637
you know, I've read
your file before.

695
00:31:16,704 --> 00:31:19,573
Um... the damage

696
00:31:19,641 --> 00:31:22,209
to your spinal cord's
pretty severe.

697
00:31:23,745 --> 00:31:24,845
Irreversible.

698
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,947
I think you know that.

699
00:31:27,015 --> 00:31:28,682
I used to know that

700
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,250
until I saw the research.

701
00:31:34,489 --> 00:31:36,323
Do you know how long
the testing process takes

702
00:31:36,391 --> 00:31:38,959
for medical protocols like this?

703
00:31:39,027 --> 00:31:42,162
At least ten years,

704
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,698
and-and that's before
they even start human trials.

705
00:31:44,766 --> 00:31:47,701
So, you know, these...
these studies

706
00:31:47,769 --> 00:31:49,570
really aren't even
in their infancies yet.

707
00:31:52,173 --> 00:31:56,677
Look, I-I truly believe
that there's gonna be a doctor

708
00:31:56,744 --> 00:31:58,946
that finds a cure
for what happened to you,

709
00:31:59,013 --> 00:32:01,482
but I...
you know,

710
00:32:01,549 --> 00:32:05,452
I don't think that's gonna be
for... a long time.

711
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:12,659
You know what? Um...
maybe you're right.

712
00:32:12,727 --> 00:32:15,462
Maybe you should start coming
to see me once a week

713
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,363
for a while.

714
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,537
Thanks, Ms. Pillsbury.

715
00:32:23,605 --> 00:32:25,906
Don't forget your, um, papers.

716
00:32:29,577 --> 00:32:31,778
{school bell rings}

717
00:32:31,846 --> 00:32:34,348
Guys, I've got good news.

718
00:32:34,415 --> 00:32:36,350
I siphoned off funds
from the Cheerios!

719
00:32:36,417 --> 00:32:38,051
and I took a little
shopping spree

720
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:39,486
through the
Jazzhands catalogue.

721
00:32:39,554 --> 00:32:40,621
You know why?

722
00:32:40,688 --> 00:32:41,955
'Cause the arts matter.

723
00:32:43,191 --> 00:32:45,192
And I got custom-made

724
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:48,862
New Directions! jean jackets

725
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:52,633
and some rad tearaway dancewear.

726
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,101
Hello.

727
00:32:54,169 --> 00:32:56,570
And every piece of sheet music

728
00:32:56,638 --> 00:32:59,173
from every Broadway show
for the last 50 years.

729
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,276
Everything a show choir needs
to become champions.

730
00:33:02,343 --> 00:33:03,510
Wow, that's just amazing.

731
00:33:03,578 --> 00:33:05,078
Let's all give a hand
for Mr. Ryan.

732
00:33:05,146 --> 00:33:06,847
RYAN:
Thank you. Thank you.

733
00:33:08,616 --> 00:33:09,917
SUE:
Congratulations, Will.

734
00:33:09,984 --> 00:33:12,619
I'm over the moon for you.

735
00:33:12,687 --> 00:33:14,521
Thanks, Sue. I'm glad
you have a good attitude

736
00:33:14,589 --> 00:33:15,689
about your budget
being cut.

737
00:33:15,757 --> 00:33:17,291
No, no, I'm not
talking about that.

738
00:33:17,358 --> 00:33:20,294
I came over here to congratulate
you on your new role.

739
00:33:20,361 --> 00:33:22,696
Local director,
Herb Duncan,

740
00:33:22,764 --> 00:33:24,064
does the dry cleaning
for the Cheerios!

741
00:33:24,132 --> 00:33:25,566
and he let it slip

742
00:33:25,633 --> 00:33:28,969
<i>that you just landed
the lead in Les Miz!</i>

743
00:33:29,037 --> 00:33:30,804
Congratulations.

744
00:33:30,872 --> 00:33:32,773
SUE:
Oh, I'm ecstatic.

745
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,741
And the good news
just keeps coming,

746
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:36,076
'cause you got a part, too, Bry.

747
00:33:36,144 --> 00:33:37,511
The exciting role

748
00:33:37,579 --> 00:33:38,879
of Townsperson.

749
00:33:38,947 --> 00:33:40,447
And you got a line, too.

750
00:33:40,515 --> 00:33:41,882
Way back here

751
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,417
in the second act,
you get to say...

752
00:33:44,586 --> 00:33:46,620
"Hooray."

753
00:33:46,688 --> 00:33:48,188
Congratulations,
both of you, really.

754
00:33:48,256 --> 00:33:49,356
I can't wait for opening night.

755
00:33:57,198 --> 00:33:59,099
WILL:
Wait, Bryan.

756
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:00,300
Congratulations, Will.

757
00:34:00,368 --> 00:34:01,868
You're going to be great
in the show.

758
00:34:01,936 --> 00:34:03,470
Can we talk about this?
Nothing to talk about.

759
00:34:03,538 --> 00:34:05,339
I'm cutting the program.

760
00:34:13,004 --> 00:34:15,238
Hooray!

761
00:34:15,306 --> 00:34:16,873
Hooray...

762
00:34:16,941 --> 00:34:19,076
Hey, Bryan. Can I talk
to you for a second?

763
00:34:19,143 --> 00:34:20,410
Make it quick.
I'm rehearsing.

764
00:34:20,478 --> 00:34:22,245
You know,
reviewing my single line.

765
00:34:22,313 --> 00:34:23,714
I want to take
one last shot

766
00:34:23,781 --> 00:34:25,382
at convincing you
not to cut the program.

767
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:27,084
Give it a rest, Will.

768
00:34:27,151 --> 00:34:28,552
You think you're
helping these kids,

769
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,220
when all you're doing
is setting them up

770
00:34:30,288 --> 00:34:31,555
to be jaded and bitter.

771
00:34:31,623 --> 00:34:32,923
You're right.

772
00:34:32,991 --> 00:34:34,725
Cut the program,
and they're certainly

773
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:37,194
more likely
to turn out like you.

774
00:34:37,261 --> 00:34:39,663
I've grown weary of
your insults, Will.

775
00:34:39,731 --> 00:34:43,300
They sting, and they make me
want to punch your face.

776
00:34:47,071 --> 00:34:49,606
{sighing}
You remember
high school?

777
00:34:50,808 --> 00:34:52,075
Remember what it's like?

778
00:34:53,378 --> 00:34:54,711
Those kids get labeled
the second

779
00:34:54,779 --> 00:34:56,246
they walk
through the door freshman year.

780
00:34:56,314 --> 00:34:57,981
Geek, punk,

781
00:34:58,049 --> 00:35:00,517
jock, queer.

782
00:35:01,986 --> 00:35:04,655
I've seen who these kids
in Glee Club really are.

783
00:35:04,722 --> 00:35:08,525
No labels, no preconceptions,
their true spirits.

784
00:35:10,261 --> 00:35:14,865
Yes, most of them
are not stars...

785
00:35:14,932 --> 00:35:17,868
but they shine like them.

786
00:35:17,935 --> 00:35:20,370
Do you know what happens
when a star dies, Bryan?

787
00:35:20,438 --> 00:35:21,838
It doesn't just disappear.

788
00:35:21,906 --> 00:35:25,142
It turns into this black hole,
this giant energy-sucking mass

789
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:27,811
that doesn't just collapse
in on itself; it takes away

790
00:35:27,879 --> 00:35:29,713
any light that comes
close down with it.

791
00:35:29,781 --> 00:35:32,983
You take away Glee,

792
00:35:33,051 --> 00:35:36,353
you're not just putting out
those kids' lights;

793
00:35:36,421 --> 00:35:39,523
you're creating 13 black holes.

794
00:35:43,661 --> 00:35:45,495
{sighs}

795
00:35:45,563 --> 00:35:47,898
I want you to take my part.

796
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,335
<i>You should play Jean Valjean.</i>

797
00:35:58,009 --> 00:35:59,643
I want you to understand

798
00:35:59,711 --> 00:36:02,145
how important the arts are
for a person's soul.

799
00:36:02,213 --> 00:36:04,381
You're a black hole
right now.

800
00:36:04,449 --> 00:36:06,683
Maybe this
will help you remember

801
00:36:06,751 --> 00:36:08,251
what it's like to be a star.

802
00:36:09,454 --> 00:36:11,488
So, what you're saying is,

803
00:36:11,556 --> 00:36:15,726
you'll give me the part
if I don't cut the program.

804
00:36:15,793 --> 00:36:17,694
Exactly.

805
00:36:17,762 --> 00:36:19,663
Cool. Deal.

806
00:36:19,731 --> 00:36:21,164
Oh, hey, sir. Hi.

807
00:36:21,232 --> 00:36:22,766
I'm your new lead, and, uh,
I'd just like

808
00:36:22,834 --> 00:36:25,268
to set up some ground rules
off the bat. First of all,

809
00:36:25,336 --> 00:36:27,437
I have a lot of ideas.
And, uh, next,

810
00:36:27,505 --> 00:36:29,039
I don't really take direction.

811
00:36:32,844 --> 00:36:34,444
Jessie, what are you doing here?

812
00:36:34,512 --> 00:36:35,779
I said that I was
going to help you

813
00:36:35,847 --> 00:36:36,813
make your dreams come true.

814
00:36:36,881 --> 00:36:38,148
No. I'm not ready.

815
00:36:38,216 --> 00:36:39,616
Yes, you are.

816
00:36:47,725 --> 00:36:50,160
{"I Dreamed a Dream" plays}

817
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,230
SHELBY {on tape}:
Hi, baby.

818
00:36:53,297 --> 00:36:54,397
It's your mom.

819
00:36:55,967 --> 00:36:58,435
I think this
pretty much says it all.

00:37:23,761 --> 00:37:27,497
¶¶ Would be forgiving ¶¶

828
00:37:29,534 --> 00:37:31,201
¶¶ Then I was young ¶¶

829
00:37:31,269 --> 00:37:36,339
¶¶ And unafraid ¶¶

830
00:37:36,407 --> 00:37:38,508

¶¶ And used and wasted ¶¶

¶¶ But the tigers
come at night ¶¶

838
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:11,308
¶¶ With their voices
soft as thunder ¶¶

839
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:15,145

00:38:15,213 --> 00:38:19,149
¶¶ As they tear
your hope apart ¶¶

843
00:38:32,964 --> 00:38:34,664
¶¶ And still I dream ¶¶

¶¶ But there are dreams ¶¶

848
00:38:47,478 --> 00:38:52,148
¶¶ That cannot be ¶¶

849
00:38:52,216 --> 00:38:54,017
¶¶ And there are storms ¶¶

850
00:38:54,085 --> 00:38:58,521
¶¶ We cannot weather ¶¶

851
00:39:02,126 --> 00:39:04,060
¶¶ I had a dream ¶¶

852
00:39:04,128 --> 00:39:08,365
¶¶ My life would be ¶¶

853
00:39:08,432 --> 00:39:12,602
¶¶ So different
from this hell I'm living ¶¶

854
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,204
¶¶ So different now ¶¶

855
00:39:14,272 --> 00:39:18,541
¶¶ From what it seemed ¶¶

856
00:39:20,111 --> 00:39:23,346
¶¶ Now life has killed ¶¶

857
00:39:23,414 --> 00:39:26,249
¶¶ The dream ¶¶

858
00:39:27,485 --> 00:39:36,793
¶¶ I dreamed. ¶¶

TINA:
Artie, please,
think about this.

860
00:39:49,774 --> 00:39:50,941
I have.

861
00:39:52,343 --> 00:39:53,710
You've worked too
hard on this routine

862
00:39:53,778 --> 00:39:55,145
to have half a partner.

863
00:39:55,212 --> 00:39:57,514
Fact is, any of
the guys in there

864
00:39:57,581 --> 00:40:00,684
could dance my part better
than me without even rehearsing

865
00:40:00,751 --> 00:40:02,018
Well, except Finn.

866
00:40:02,086 --> 00:40:03,553
But I want to dance with you.

867
00:40:03,621 --> 00:40:06,723
I can't dance,
and I never will.

868
00:40:07,892 --> 00:40:09,960
But... that's okay.

869
00:40:10,027 --> 00:40:11,728
I'm never going to
dunk a basketball

870
00:40:11,796 --> 00:40:13,063
or kill a lion, either.

871
00:40:14,865 --> 00:40:18,902
I have to focus on dreams
that I can make come true.

872
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:20,370
I'm good, Tina.

873
00:40:20,438 --> 00:40:21,738
Really.

874
00:40:28,479 --> 00:40:30,847
Will you at least
sing the song?

875
00:40:30,915 --> 00:40:32,716
Sure.

876
00:40:37,054 --> 00:40:38,588
{school bell ringing}

877
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,924
All right, guys, listen up.

878
00:40:40,992 --> 00:40:42,625
Tina has something
that she wants

879
00:40:42,693 --> 00:40:44,427
to share with all
of us, but first,

880
00:40:44,495 --> 00:40:46,296
I have an announcement to make.

881
00:40:46,364 --> 00:40:47,731
You've all been reprieved.

882
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,500
Bryan Ryan isn't cutting Glee.

883
00:40:51,669 --> 00:40:52,869
Yeah.

884
00:40:52,937 --> 00:40:54,704
Did he die?

885
00:40:54,772 --> 00:40:56,306
No. He didn't die.

886
00:40:56,374 --> 00:40:58,308
He, uh, is going
to be distracted

887
00:40:58,376 --> 00:41:01,211
<i>for a couple months making
his star turn in Les Miz.</i>

888
00:41:01,278 --> 00:41:02,579
He got the lead role.

889
00:41:02,646 --> 00:41:04,447
But I thought you got the lead.

890
00:41:04,515 --> 00:41:05,882
I resigned.

891
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,784
It was the price
for keeping the club.

892
00:41:07,852 --> 00:41:09,886
Sorry you had to do that,
Mr. Shue.

893
00:41:09,954 --> 00:41:11,388
I'm not.

894
00:41:11,455 --> 00:41:13,790
You know, th-the way I see it,

895
00:41:13,858 --> 00:41:15,892
I'm trading my one dream

896
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,262
for the chance that all 13
of you might find yours.

897
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:22,799
I mean, come on-- you can't
argue with those numbers.

898
00:41:22,867 --> 00:41:24,000
So, let's start
with Tina's dream.

899
00:41:24,068 --> 00:41:26,569
Come on up, Tina.

900
00:41:26,637 --> 00:41:28,671
Tina, I understand
that you whipped up

901
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:30,340
a little dance number
for us--

902
00:41:30,408 --> 00:41:32,142
a breakout that we might use
at Regionals.

903
00:41:32,209 --> 00:41:33,410
Yes.

904
00:41:33,477 --> 00:41:35,178
You got a dance partner?

905
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,615
Mike Chang.

906
00:41:38,682 --> 00:41:39,983
Chang.
Yeah!

907
00:41:40,051 --> 00:41:41,418
Whoo!
Chang. All right.

908
00:41:41,485 --> 00:41:42,819
All right, Chang!

909
00:41:42,887 --> 00:41:45,155

¶¶ Dream a little dream of me,
dream a little dream of me. ¶¶
