1
00:01:47,724 --> 00:01:50,955
Did you see that? Did you see
the way he looked at that bridesmaid?

2
00:01:51,127 --> 00:01:55,791
Oh, no. He was just looking around
and accidentally there was a bridesmaid.

3
00:01:55,965 --> 00:01:57,489
Why doesn't he look at me?

4
00:01:57,667 --> 00:01:59,999
Oh, he has seen you.

5
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,812
Did you catch that?

6
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,813
-Flirting right up to the last minute.
-Oh, don't be silly.

7
00:02:13,983 --> 00:02:16,713
l'll never be able to trust that girl.

8
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:16,043
Oh, l won't need you
anymore today, Thompson.

9
00:03:29,492 --> 00:03:31,517
-Good morning, Mrs. Kent.
-Oh, good morning.

10
00:03:31,694 --> 00:03:35,061
We've booked you and Mr. Kent on
the Southern Queen sailing next Tuesday.

11
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:37,756
Good. Did you get us a stateroom
on the promenade deck?

12
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:40,869
Naturally. We've also arranged
for your accommodations in Rio...

13
00:03:41,037 --> 00:03:42,231
...at the Hotel Atlantico.

14
00:03:42,405 --> 00:03:44,066
-The presidential suite.
-Of course.

15
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,571
-How do you do?
-Good morning.

16
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:50,111
Don't worry, in Rio, our man will meet you
at the boat and escort you to the hotel.

17
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,907
Fine.

18
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:53,239
Here she is again.

19
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:57,443
You take care of her, Dudley,
in a nice way. l got stuck last time.

20
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,180
Quite a character.
Comes in here every few months.

21
00:04:00,356 --> 00:04:03,086
Loads up on literature,
plans elaborate tours.

22
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:05,489
-Never goes on one of them.
-Really?

23
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,358
-Why is that?
-Well, she's just a singer in a honky-tonk.

24
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:10,294
Hasn't got a dime.

25
00:04:10,466 --> 00:04:13,435
l think there are some papers here
for you to sign, Mrs. Kent.

26
00:04:13,603 --> 00:04:16,163
-Oh, how do you do, Miss Garrett?
-Oh, greetings, chum.

27
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,036
My, we haven't seen you, let's see now,
since you didn't go to Switzerland.

28
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,770
l got a big kick out of planning that.
What looks good this time of the year?

29
00:04:23,947 --> 00:04:25,471
How about the Canadian Rockies?

30
00:04:25,648 --> 00:04:28,845
Canadian Rockies? Don't you remember?
l already haven't been there.

31
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,918
Oh, of course, l'm sorry.

32
00:04:31,087 --> 00:04:34,853
What about a cruise through the Canal,
and return home by train from Los Angeles?

33
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,821
The Canal's for schmoes.

34
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:39,985
Come on, what really looks good?

35
00:04:40,163 --> 00:04:43,394
Well, South America's
getting a heavy play.

36
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:46,626
We have some literature on it,
if you'll just step right over here.

37
00:04:46,803 --> 00:04:48,065
-Sure.
-Here are the papers.

38
00:04:48,237 --> 00:04:49,534
-Hello, Miss Garrett.
-Hi.

39
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,697
South America,
the seat of ancient cultures.

40
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,775
Museums, missions,
archeological ruins abound.

41
00:04:54,944 --> 00:04:56,571
South America.

42
00:04:59,248 --> 00:05:01,409
You could tell by her manana....

43
00:05:01,851 --> 00:05:04,342
Manana, that fractures me.

44
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,818
What has South America got
besides romantic ruins?

45
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,391
Let's see. lt says here there are
approximately four men to every woman--

46
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,393
That's enough.
Doesn't hurt a girl to be outnumbered.

47
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,655
-Pardon me.
-Yes?

48
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:18,892
-We're set up to take your passport photo.
-Oh, thank you. l'll be right in.

49
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,532
As long as l'm handy,
l might as well have one taken too.

50
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:26,834
But, Miss Garrett, you've already
had seven passport pictures taken.

51
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,376
But never as a blond.

52
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,758
-Are you going to tell your husband?
-Oh, no, no. Not yet.

53
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,867
l want some time
to prepare him for it. Well....

54
00:05:53,036 --> 00:05:56,563
Before you go,
there's just one more thing.

55
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:04,679
-Uncle. Uncle.
-Yeah.

56
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:06,712
-What happened?
-Do you see what l see?

57
00:06:06,883 --> 00:06:09,477
-What do you see?
-lsn't that Elvira down there?

58
00:06:11,754 --> 00:06:14,587
Now, Michael, don't tell me
you are still jealous of her.

59
00:06:14,757 --> 00:06:17,419
-Well, why did they raise the top?
-l don't know.

60
00:06:17,593 --> 00:06:20,323
Maybe they are afraid it will rain.

61
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,402
Let's face it, uncle.
Elvira's a flirt, always has been.

62
00:06:28,571 --> 00:06:30,596
Thought marriage would change her,
it hasn't.

63
00:06:30,773 --> 00:06:32,172
Just the opposite, my boy.

64
00:06:32,341 --> 00:06:35,276
When a woman is married,
she has to flirt twice as hard...

65
00:06:35,445 --> 00:06:37,379
...to prove she's still got it.

66
00:06:43,453 --> 00:06:45,011
Yes?

67
00:06:45,188 --> 00:06:47,383
-Yes what?
-Whom do you wish to see?

68
00:06:47,557 --> 00:06:49,616
Mr. Michael Kent.

69
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:51,553
Who are you?

70
00:06:51,727 --> 00:06:53,524
Oh, l'm Mr. Kent's secretary.

71
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:55,459
Oh, since when?

72
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:58,031
Since 9:00 this morning.

73
00:06:58,568 --> 00:07:02,299
-Who are you?
-Mrs. Michael Kent, since three years ago.

74
00:07:02,972 --> 00:07:05,133
Oh, really?

75
00:07:05,308 --> 00:07:07,936
Why do you say, ''Oh, really''?

76
00:07:08,544 --> 00:07:11,604
Well, l didn't know
Mr. Kent was married.

77
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:13,544
Well, you've only been here
since 9:00.

78
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:16,947
He couldn't have gotten very far
in the story of his life.

79
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,578
Shall l announce you to Mich--?
l mean, Mr. Kent?

80
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:21,846
Never mind.

81
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,958
l'll just walk in on Mr. Ke--

82
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:26,561
l mean, Michael.

83
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:32,233
-Hello.
-Oh, hello, darling.

84
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:34,892
-Your hat's on crooked.
-it's supposed to be that way.

85
00:07:35,071 --> 00:07:36,197
Oh, is it?

86
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:39,034
Looks very cute. Very cute.

87
00:07:39,342 --> 00:07:41,367
We'll take care of that a little later.

88
00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:45,413
Who was that you just drove up with?

89
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:47,105
l was hoping you wouldn't see me.

90
00:07:47,283 --> 00:07:49,751
Well, if you must know,
it was an automobile salesman.

91
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,319
You looked so chummy,
could've sworn he was a friend.

92
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:54,388
He was just showing me
how the car worked.

93
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,650
You didn't tell me
you were getting a new car.

94
00:07:56,826 --> 00:07:59,226
You didn't tell me
you were getting a new secretary.

95
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,885
Where did she come from?

96
00:08:01,764 --> 00:08:04,358
Oh, from the Acme Secretarial School,
l suppose.

97
00:08:04,534 --> 00:08:08,630
By the time we're back from South America,
she'll be able to type with all 1 0 fingers.

98
00:08:09,372 --> 00:08:10,839
Oh, South America.

99
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:13,800
-What's the matter, dear?
-Nothing, nothing.

100
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:14,965
Oh, excuse me.

101
00:08:15,144 --> 00:08:17,044
-Mr. Kent, you wanted to see these.
-Fine.

102
00:08:17,213 --> 00:08:20,114
Put them out on the whole chain.
l want everyone to smell good.

103
00:08:20,283 --> 00:08:21,682
Yes, sir.

104
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:25,848
Michael, every time you say,
''Oh, uh, um'' like that...

105
00:08:26,022 --> 00:08:28,957
...l know there's something on your mind
and not in your throat.

106
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,593
-What about our trip?
-Well, darling, this is it.

107
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,628
l'm afraid we're going
to have to postpone it again.

108
00:08:34,797 --> 00:08:36,765
Postpone it? Why?

109
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:40,699
-Business. Something came up this morning.
-About 9:00 this morning.

110
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,462
Yes, yes, about 9.

111
00:08:42,638 --> 00:08:45,072
Phone call from the West.
Great chance for a merger.

112
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:49,177
Listen, marriage is a merger too, you know,
and a darned important one.

113
00:08:49,345 --> 00:08:50,676
l know, l know.

114
00:08:50,846 --> 00:08:53,007
lf we can grab
the Great Western Drug Company...

115
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:55,582
...there won't be a hot-water bottle
without our name on it.

116
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:57,241
That's a comfort.

117
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,980
Tell J.B. to put those
on a national network.

118
00:09:00,156 --> 00:09:02,681
You wanted me to remind you
of your lunch appointment.

119
00:09:02,858 --> 00:09:04,291
Yes, thank you, Miss Medwick.

120
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,223
Bye-bye, dear.
May see you at dinner.

121
00:09:06,395 --> 00:09:07,453
Glad you see it my way.

122
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:12,158
Come along, bring your notebook.
This is not only lunch, it's business.

123
00:09:15,404 --> 00:09:18,896
-Would you please sign these?
-Oh, yes, yes.

124
00:09:28,684 --> 00:09:29,981
That's a wonderful perfume.

125
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,347
Don't believe we carry that
in our stores.

126
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:37,356
-Would you mind telling me what it is?
-lt's called Tonight or Never.

127
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:43,828
lt's your photo. A messenger brought it
from the Baker Travel Agency.

128
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,467
A lot of good it'll do me now.

129
00:09:45,635 --> 00:09:48,661
-Maybe we'd better put it in stock.
-Oh, yes, sir.

130
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:52,296
Well, if you don't want it,
l'd be glad to keep it as a souvenir.

131
00:09:52,475 --> 00:09:53,942
You're sweet.

132
00:09:55,544 --> 00:09:57,205
Excuse me.

133
00:09:57,647 --> 00:09:59,410
Would you mind finishing?

134
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,960
-Hello, dear.
-Hello, Uncle Lazlo.

135
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:14,358
Your hat is on crooked.

136
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,361
lt's supposed to be that way.

137
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:20,736
l guess you heard Michael
cannot go to South America.

138
00:10:20,903 --> 00:10:23,963
Uncle Lazlo, couldn't you handle
this deal yourself?

139
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,439
No, darling, l cannot do anything
without Michael.

140
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:33,014
l am the president of the company, but
he is my brains in the drugstore business.

141
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:36,174
When l started in this business
nobody was helping me.

142
00:10:36,352 --> 00:10:38,752
No. l was a soda jerker.

143
00:10:40,456 --> 00:10:43,391
l was such a thin boy,
my boss was such a guy.

144
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,494
One mistake, l got a punch in the nose.

145
00:10:46,662 --> 00:10:47,959
But now it is different.

146
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,462
l am the success,
so he does all the work.

147
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:53,830
No, no, no, l cannot let Michael go,
not for a day.

148
00:10:54,003 --> 00:10:56,096
He's the great business head.

149
00:10:56,272 --> 00:10:58,866
l didn't marry Mike
for his business head.

150
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:02,869
He's so attractive,
but he's such a wolf.

151
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:06,708
Don't you think it's a little strange
that this business deal should pop up...

152
00:11:06,882 --> 00:11:09,407
...the same morning
he hires a beautiful new secretary?

153
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:13,112
l know what you are insinuating,
but you are 90 percent wrong.

154
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,557
What about the other 1 0 percent?

155
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:19,684
Oh, well, l'm not saying that Michael
has not looked at another woman.

156
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:20,851
Who hasn't?

157
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:25,057
l have looked at women,
and the few that looked back, l married.

158
00:11:25,234 --> 00:11:26,758
That cured me of looking.

159
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:31,930
l will tell you what, l still like women,
but l stopped looking.

160
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:34,936
Well, that isn't me.

161
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,306
ls there a phone number
on the back? Let me see.

162
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,643
-A nice girl.
-l thought you'd stopped looking.

163
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:44,919
Why, l know who that is.
That's that girl in the agency.

164
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:46,281
She's quite a character.

165
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:50,221
Elvira, dear, why not forget about Michael
and take this trip yourself. Why?

166
00:11:50,393 --> 00:11:53,191
And leave him here
with a free hand? Oh, no.

167
00:11:53,362 --> 00:11:54,351
Don't be silly.

168
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,792
Even if you were here...

169
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,991
...if Michael wanted to play around
in a city like New York...

170
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:01,328
...with a little caution:

171
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:05,529
lf he thought l was away,
he wouldn't bother about being careful.

172
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,677
How l'd love to go to South America
and catch Michael here.

173
00:12:08,844 --> 00:12:13,804
My dear niece, not only is it impossible,
but it cannot be done.

174
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,678
Uncle.

175
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:17,443
-What?
-l think l have an idea.

176
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,679
What--? What idea?

177
00:12:19,855 --> 00:12:23,188
Get me the Baker Travel Agency,
and l wanna speak to Charles, please.

178
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:25,987
Uncle, we're going
nightclubbing tonight.

179
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,595
Night-- Nightclubbing?

180
00:12:27,763 --> 00:12:30,288
Hello, Charles. This is Mrs. Kent.

181
00:12:40,876 --> 00:12:43,606
-Uncle. Uncle.
-Yes?

182
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:45,576
This is the girl.

183
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:47,878
l hope you know what you are doing.

184
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,413
Waiter, have you a table for two?

185
00:12:50,586 --> 00:12:52,747
Sorry, no formal dress allowed.

186
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:53,946
Why?

187
00:12:54,123 --> 00:12:55,886
Makes the customers
feel uncomfortable.

188
00:12:56,058 --> 00:12:59,619
Oh, makes them uncomfortable.
And how much makes them comfortable?

189
00:12:59,795 --> 00:13:02,491
You rich guys think
that money can buy anything.

190
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:04,633
How right you are.

191
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:11,599
Nobody would ever suspect
you love music.

192
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:13,503
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

193
00:13:13,676 --> 00:13:15,268
That ought to prove l'm not rude.

194
00:13:15,444 --> 00:13:19,005
We now present our singing star,
an Oscar Farrar discovery...

195
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:23,550
...trained by Oscar Farrar, and appearing
here through the courtesy of Oscar Farrar.

196
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,653
lncidentally, my name is Oscar--

197
00:13:25,821 --> 00:13:27,618
Seems to escape me for the moment.

198
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,520
Miss Georgia Garrett.

199
00:13:36,932 --> 00:13:38,160
Hi, baby.

200
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,065
Although I'm smitten

201
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,174
I've never written

202
00:13:46,342 --> 00:13:50,506
Any poetry at all

203
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:55,275
Not even the kind
That you usually find

204
00:13:55,451 --> 00:14:00,184
On a schoolhouse wall

205
00:14:00,356 --> 00:14:03,484
The poems that I've composed

206
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:07,561
I could never win a cup with

207
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:12,690
After trying and trying
And trying and trying

208
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:14,699
This is what I came up with

209
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,804
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love

210
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:19,497
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love

211
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:21,506
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love

212
00:14:21,677 --> 00:14:24,145
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love

213
00:14:24,313 --> 00:14:26,543
I'm in love, I'm in love

214
00:14:26,715 --> 00:14:28,979
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love

215
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:31,585
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love

216
00:14:31,754 --> 00:14:35,815
I'm in love with you

217
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:38,425
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love

218
00:14:38,594 --> 00:14:40,619
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love

219
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,026
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love

220
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:45,063
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love

221
00:14:45,234 --> 00:14:46,326
In love--

222
00:14:46,502 --> 00:14:48,493
So she's in love.

223
00:14:49,838 --> 00:14:54,036
I'm in love, I'm in love

224
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:58,942
I'm in love

225
00:14:59,114 --> 00:15:03,278
I'm in love

226
00:15:03,452 --> 00:15:07,354
I'm in love, I'm in love

227
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:11,653
I'm in love

228
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:16,526
I'm in love with....

229
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:19,031
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love

230
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:26,004
I'm in love with you

231
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:36,643
-What was the name of that song?
-''l'm in Love.''

232
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,880
-Did l do right by you?
-You always do.

233
00:15:41,056 --> 00:15:42,318
But all this is beneath me.

234
00:15:42,491 --> 00:15:44,220
Marry me so l can quit this job.

235
00:15:44,393 --> 00:15:46,327
l'm getting tired of turning you down.

236
00:15:46,495 --> 00:15:49,828
Marry me and get yourself a dependent.
l'm deductible.

237
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:52,729
Oscar, you're a sweet kid,
but just a little offensive.

238
00:15:52,901 --> 00:15:55,961
l always wanted to marry a girl
who could tune a piano on the side.

239
00:15:56,138 --> 00:15:57,833
Once and for all,
will you marry me?

240
00:15:58,273 --> 00:16:00,173
-Answer yes or no.
-No.

241
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:02,774
We'll continue this discussion later.

242
00:16:02,945 --> 00:16:04,913
Will you see me home?

243
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,145
Hey, Georgia, a couple
of income-tax evaders...

244
00:16:08,317 --> 00:16:11,411
...want you to have a drink with them.
Table seven.

245
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:13,646
l'll drink with them,
but autographs are out.

246
00:16:13,822 --> 00:16:15,847
-Okay.
-Captain, did they ask for me too?

247
00:16:16,025 --> 00:16:17,253
No one ever asks for you.

248
00:16:17,426 --> 00:16:20,395
How did a sweet kid like you
ever get into this kind of a racket?

249
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:24,859
-Hello.
-Hello.

250
00:16:25,034 --> 00:16:26,865
-Hi.
-Miss Garrett, l'm Elvira Kent.

251
00:16:27,036 --> 00:16:29,061
-And this is my uncle, Lazlo Lazlo.
-Hello.

252
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,229
lf he isn't your uncle,
is that my business?

253
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,501
You can believe me, she's my niece.
l have experiences in nieces.

254
00:16:34,677 --> 00:16:37,475
-Won't you sit down?
-Don't be surprised if l do.

255
00:16:37,646 --> 00:16:39,045
That's cute.

256
00:16:39,214 --> 00:16:41,512
We ordered champagne
if it is all right with you.

257
00:16:41,684 --> 00:16:43,549
So l'm stuck with it.

258
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:46,717
Say, haven't l seen you someplace?

259
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:48,754
Baker Travel Agency.

260
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,484
What's more they sent me
your passport photo by mistake.

261
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,289
The schmoes, they sent me yours.
lt's right in my dressing room, you want it?

262
00:16:55,464 --> 00:16:58,592
-There's no hurry.
-You can keep mine. l'm not going anyplace.

263
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,257
Well, neither am l.

264
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,801
Did you run out of money too?

265
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,461
Oh, no, no, no.
My niece cannot run out of money.

266
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,234
l am the owner
of one of the greatest drugstore chains.

267
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:09,809
When l came in this country
l was a soda jerker.

268
00:17:09,978 --> 00:17:12,913
l was such a thin boy,
my boss was such a guy.

269
00:17:13,082 --> 00:17:16,882
One mistake, l got a punch
in the nose-- No, no.

270
00:17:17,352 --> 00:17:19,286
-Miss Garrett.
-Listening.

271
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,083
How would you like to go
to South America after all?

272
00:17:22,257 --> 00:17:23,724
How would l like to go to--?

273
00:17:23,892 --> 00:17:26,326
-Oh, you mean as a stowaway?
-No.

274
00:17:26,495 --> 00:17:30,226
ln a first class cabin, all expenses paid,
and $ 1 000 spending money.

275
00:17:31,266 --> 00:17:34,099
What radio program do you two represent,
and how did l win it?

276
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:37,534
Oh, no, nothing to do with radio
or contests or anything like that. No.

277
00:17:37,706 --> 00:17:39,901
What's the catch?
There must be a catch.

278
00:17:40,075 --> 00:17:41,167
There is.

279
00:17:41,343 --> 00:17:43,334
You see, you have to travel
under my name.

280
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:46,242
-Under your name? You tired of it?
-No.

281
00:17:46,415 --> 00:17:48,940
-You see, l'm married and--
-Oh, ashamed of it.

282
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:50,380
No.

283
00:17:50,552 --> 00:17:53,749
-Miss Garrett, l don't trust my husband.
-Natch.

284
00:17:53,922 --> 00:17:57,255
lf he thought l was in South America,
he'd play around quite openly--

285
00:17:57,426 --> 00:17:59,792
And she would be here to catch him.

286
00:17:59,962 --> 00:18:03,090
Well, why not let him play around?
Keeps them off the streets.

287
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,659
Please. This is a legitimate offer.

288
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,632
Yes, it is.

289
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:12,937
Do you mean after all these years
of planning and dreaming...

290
00:18:13,108 --> 00:18:15,599
...and never getting
out of Far Rockaway...?

291
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:18,303
You mean this thing
is just gonna fall right in my lap?

292
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,970
Right in your laps.

293
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:22,014
Well, what am l asking questions for?

294
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,778
-Lady, have you got yourself a deal.
-Oh, good.

295
00:18:24,953 --> 00:18:26,477
-Let's drink to that.
-Wonderful.

296
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:29,246
A votre what?

297
00:18:30,592 --> 00:18:32,219
-What does that mean?
-Your health.

298
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:34,555
Mine's fine, thanks. How's yours?

299
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,426
-Don't pack that. l'll need that in New York.
-Beg pardon?

300
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:39,191
l mean, l won't be using it in Rio.

301
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,029
You can stop packing, Marie.

302
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,864
-Hello, darling.
-Hello.

303
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:46,439
l'll finish the merger by the end
of the week, and then l can go with you.

304
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:49,240
l said l'll be finished in a few days.

305
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:50,639
Aren't you happy?

306
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:53,915
Oh, yes, l certainly am.

307
00:18:54,082 --> 00:18:57,415
lt's just that it interferes
with all my plans.

308
00:18:57,586 --> 00:18:59,053
Plans? What plans?

309
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:03,055
What she means is her boat leaves
tomorrow and not in a few days, you know.

310
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,785
But another one leaves Saturday.
That's only 96 hours.

311
00:19:05,961 --> 00:19:09,988
But-- But-- But, darling, you can't
complete a decent merger in 96 hours.

312
00:19:10,165 --> 00:19:12,292
She's right.
lf you should mess up this deal...

313
00:19:12,467 --> 00:19:14,697
-...you'll never forgive yourself.
-Yes, l will.

314
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,531
Then l'll never forgive you.

315
00:19:16,705 --> 00:19:18,798
-Oh, the phone.
-Now, look, darling, this is--

316
00:19:18,974 --> 00:19:22,000
Hello. Oh, hello, Georgia.

317
00:19:22,177 --> 00:19:24,441
Oh, l can't talk to you now, dear,
l'm in a hurry.

318
00:19:24,613 --> 00:19:27,514
-l'll see you on the boat.
-Who's this you'll see on the boat?

319
00:19:27,683 --> 00:19:29,082
-George who?
-George who?

320
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,845
Oh, George who?
Oh, not George who...

321
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,716
...Georgia. Just a girlfriend of mine.

322
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:39,019
But no, darling, you stay here
and take care of your affairs.

323
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:41,253
Well, this seems
very funny to me.

324
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,898
Very funny that you
can't wait till Saturday.

325
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:45,727
Only four days.

326
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:50,964
-Don't you think it's funny, uncle?
-No, it isn't funny at all.

327
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:54,108
Maybe not to you, because
you have no feelings of such matters.

328
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,870
What--? l have no feeling?
You have no feeling.

329
00:19:57,045 --> 00:19:59,377
You are talking, talking,
don't know what about.

330
00:19:59,548 --> 00:20:02,415
She cannot postpone her trip.
lt's settled with Georgia.

331
00:20:02,584 --> 00:20:04,609
What's settled?
Say, who is this Georgia?

332
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,777
You see, you haven't
the faintest notion.

333
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,423
Georgia is the girl who has to--

334
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:13,289
You are driving me crazy.

335
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,198
Elvira, don't you think
you owe me an explanation?

336
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:22,735
l can't hear a word you're saying,
the shower's making too much noise.

337
00:20:22,905 --> 00:20:24,167
Just what are you up to?

338
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:25,931
l can't talk to you right now.

339
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:28,201
l want one reason,
at least one good reason...

340
00:20:28,377 --> 00:20:30,140
...why you have to go off by yourself.

341
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,075
l can't talk to you right now.

342
00:20:32,247 --> 00:20:34,272
lf l can't hear you,
at least let me see you.

343
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:42,789
Now, are you gonna wait for me?
Yes or no?

344
00:21:06,381 --> 00:21:08,611
-Oh, hello.
-Come in.

345
00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:12,618
-Excuse me, are you Peter Virgil?
-l am.

346
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:15,484
-Peter Virgil, the detective?
-Yes.

347
00:21:15,657 --> 00:21:18,148
My client suspects
his wife is slowly poisoning him...

348
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:20,761
...and l was just examining the evidence.

349
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,831
No, there's no poison.
lt could stand a little sugar though.

350
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,592
Excuse me. See l....

351
00:21:26,768 --> 00:21:30,397
l figure as long as there's no poison,
why, l might as well drink it.

352
00:21:30,572 --> 00:21:33,006
-Would you join me in a cup of evidence?
-No, thanks.

353
00:21:33,175 --> 00:21:35,473
Well, sit down.
What can l do for you?

354
00:21:35,644 --> 00:21:38,306
Well, you'll excuse me
for being blunt, Mr. Virgil.

355
00:21:41,817 --> 00:21:43,284
Tell me, Mr. Virgil...

356
00:21:43,452 --> 00:21:45,317
-...are you a good detective?
-Naturally.

357
00:21:47,489 --> 00:21:50,981
-Where did you get your training?
-ln the Army. lntelligence G-2.

358
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:52,956
Well, were you good at your job?

359
00:21:53,362 --> 00:21:55,330
We won the war, didn't we?

360
00:21:55,497 --> 00:21:59,490
Before that l was a vaudeville hoofer,
wrestler, and a magician's assistant.

361
00:21:59,668 --> 00:22:03,035
So you can see,
l'm a man of wide experience, Mr....

362
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:05,170
Kent. Michael Kent.

363
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,103
See how l wormed that name
out of you?

364
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:10,108
Mr. Virgil, l'm here
on a very delicate matter.

365
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:11,711
-l suppose you're married?
-Yes.

366
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,280
l know what l'm doing
is not quite the right thing--

367
00:22:14,449 --> 00:22:17,111
But what you suspect your wife
is doing is even worse?

368
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:19,184
The fact of the matter is, Mr. Virgil...

369
00:22:19,354 --> 00:22:22,653
...my wife is leaving day after tomorrow
on a South American cruise...

370
00:22:22,824 --> 00:22:25,987
...and, well, she insists
on going without me.

371
00:22:26,194 --> 00:22:29,857
To a man of your nature, that means
only one thing, another man on the boat.

372
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:32,500
See, l don't know.
That's what l want you to find out.

373
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:37,001
Well, you've come to the right man.
l've handled so many of these cases. l--

374
00:22:37,172 --> 00:22:38,537
Excuse me.

375
00:22:38,807 --> 00:22:39,796
Hello.

376
00:22:39,975 --> 00:22:41,306
Oh, yes, how are you?

377
00:22:42,077 --> 00:22:44,238
Well, certainly l shadowed your wife.

378
00:22:44,413 --> 00:22:48,179
l hate to tell you this, but you were right.
She's been two-timing you.

379
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,183
Hello? Hello?

380
00:22:51,653 --> 00:22:53,245
He fainted.

381
00:22:56,324 --> 00:22:57,916
Sometimes there's a shot.

382
00:22:58,093 --> 00:22:59,890
Now, where were we?

383
00:23:00,062 --> 00:23:03,623
Mr. Virgil, l want you to get on the same
boat with my wife and shadow her.

384
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,734
-l'll have to leave all of my business.
-l'll make it up to you.

385
00:23:06,902 --> 00:23:10,702
l can tell you right now without batting
an eyelash, it'll cost you $ 1 000 a week.

386
00:23:10,872 --> 00:23:12,999
Well, that's a little steep,
isn't it, old boy?

387
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,808
Yes, yes, it is,
but l'll probably get seasick.

388
00:23:17,412 --> 00:23:20,279
Well, all right, all right.
l'll book your passage.

389
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,408
Move your chair closer, will you?

390
00:23:22,584 --> 00:23:25,144
There's a little confidential information
l must have.

391
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,309
Oh, excuse me.

392
00:23:27,022 --> 00:23:28,011
Hello.

393
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,349
Well, what do you know...

394
00:23:31,526 --> 00:23:33,858
...he didn't even wait
for me to tell him.

395
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:44,303
lt still isn't too late.

396
00:23:44,473 --> 00:23:47,067
-Can't you wait two or three weeks?
-Don't be ridiculous.

397
00:23:47,242 --> 00:23:50,837
-Here l am, we're sailing any minute.
-l can get you off the boat in a while.

398
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,776
Will you please not worry about me?
l'll be back in no time.

399
00:23:53,949 --> 00:23:55,974
Yeah, l know,
but l'm gonna miss you so much.

400
00:23:56,151 --> 00:23:58,483
You just have the feeling
that l'm always near you.

401
00:23:58,653 --> 00:24:00,917
l'll try. And, darling,
l want you to remember...

402
00:24:01,089 --> 00:24:03,614
...that wherever you are
l'll be watching over you.

403
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:05,419
Oh, what a lovely sentiment.

404
00:24:05,594 --> 00:24:07,391
Oh, isn't that the warning whistle?

405
00:24:07,562 --> 00:24:09,587
Well, l didn't hear anything.
Did you, uncle?

406
00:24:09,764 --> 00:24:11,959
The whistle? Yes, sure l heard.

407
00:24:12,134 --> 00:24:13,863
l still hear it.

408
00:24:14,302 --> 00:24:18,295
-Well, goodbye, darling.
-Goodbye.

409
00:24:19,574 --> 00:24:21,235
Have fun.

410
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,068
Come along, uncle.

411
00:24:23,245 --> 00:24:25,839
-Well, goodbye, darling.
-Goodbye. Goodbye.

412
00:24:27,582 --> 00:24:30,608
l didn't lie, just the whistle is a little late.

413
00:24:36,258 --> 00:24:39,455
l understand running away from me,
but not on such an elaborate scale.

414
00:24:39,628 --> 00:24:41,789
lt was very sweet of you
to come down. Goodbye.

415
00:24:41,963 --> 00:24:45,399
l'll give you one more chance to explain.
Where did you get the money?

416
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,364
-l told you.
-You didn't tell me.

417
00:24:47,536 --> 00:24:51,666
-That's right, l told you l couldn't tell you.
-You treat me like an empty suit.

418
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,037
-Are you going with somebody?
-Scouts honor, l'm traveling alone.

419
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,871
That's no fun.
Georgia, l won't let you do this.

420
00:24:58,046 --> 00:25:00,241
lt's not only walking out
on your job and me...

421
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:03,179
...once you go, you cut down
my list of friends 1 00 percent.

422
00:25:03,351 --> 00:25:05,319
-Think of that.
-l have thought about it.

423
00:25:05,487 --> 00:25:06,784
That's the gratitude l get.

424
00:25:06,955 --> 00:25:09,515
l taught you everything you know,
gave you a career.

425
00:25:09,691 --> 00:25:13,684
l picked you up when you were working for
$45 a week and gave you a job at the club.

426
00:25:13,862 --> 00:25:15,124
At a snappy 40 a week.

427
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:19,192
You can't expect to start at the top,
although l've often wondered why not.

428
00:25:20,535 --> 00:25:23,800
Oscar, you better go.
l have so many things to do before we sail.

429
00:25:23,972 --> 00:25:26,532
l know when l'm not wanted.
lt happens to me constantly.

430
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:28,335
Oscar.

431
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,402
Aren't you gonna kiss me?

432
00:25:30,579 --> 00:25:32,877
l don't know how. Will you show me?

433
00:25:33,882 --> 00:25:35,782
You don't know how either.

434
00:25:36,384 --> 00:25:37,681
B flat, that's your key.

435
00:25:37,852 --> 00:25:40,844
Don't forget to put your shoes
in front of the cabin every night.

436
00:25:41,022 --> 00:25:42,284
-Be sure to write.
-l will.

437
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:46,450
-You sure you're not going with somebody?
-Goodbye, Oscar.

438
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,324
-You're sure everything's gonna be all right?
-Don't worry.

439
00:25:49,497 --> 00:25:51,829
l want you to write me
every chance you get.

440
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,127
lf what l have
can't go through the mails...

441
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,600
-...l'll phone you.
-All right.

442
00:25:56,771 --> 00:25:57,863
l've had a lot of these.

443
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:00,564
-l hope what l'm doing is all right.
-You're all right.

444
00:26:00,742 --> 00:26:02,676
-Everything's all right.
-Okay.

445
00:26:07,048 --> 00:26:09,175
-Oh, excuse me.
-Sorry.

446
00:26:11,219 --> 00:26:12,277
Should l wait for you?

447
00:26:12,454 --> 00:26:15,116
No, you'd better go with Michael.
He might get suspicious.

448
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,279
Come in.

449
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:18,187
-All clear?
-Nobody here but my uncle.

450
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,089
And l am practically gone already.

451
00:26:20,295 --> 00:26:22,627
Have a nice trip, my da--
Oh, pardon me.

452
00:26:22,797 --> 00:26:24,765
You have a-- Oh, excuse me.

453
00:26:24,933 --> 00:26:26,127
-See you later.
-All right.

454
00:26:26,301 --> 00:26:27,632
-Good luck to you.
-Goodbye.

455
00:26:27,802 --> 00:26:29,633
-Goodbye.
-You all right?

456
00:26:29,804 --> 00:26:33,262
Oh, you don't know what a tough time
l had getting rid of my boyfriend.

457
00:26:33,441 --> 00:26:34,430
l'm beat.

458
00:26:34,743 --> 00:26:37,576
Georgia-- l mean, Elvira,
because that's gonna be your name...

459
00:26:37,746 --> 00:26:40,544
...for the next few months.
Please be careful of your speech.

460
00:26:40,715 --> 00:26:42,876
Mrs. Kent may be fatigued,
but she's never beat.

461
00:26:43,051 --> 00:26:45,281
Okay, l'm fatigued, but my feet hurt.

462
00:26:48,089 --> 00:26:49,954
Michael.

463
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:53,026
Michael. l thought l lost you.

464
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:57,631
Well, you see, l was just seeing a friend
about some business in South America.

465
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:01,064
Well, goodbye, Georgia. Best of luck.
l hope you have a wonderful trip.

466
00:27:01,236 --> 00:27:04,228
-Thanks.
-And l almost forgot to tell you, l overtip.

467
00:27:04,406 --> 00:27:06,397
-Okay. lt's your money.
-That's right.

468
00:27:06,574 --> 00:27:09,771
Now let me see, checked the passenger list,
nobody knows me.

469
00:27:09,944 --> 00:27:11,070
So far so good.

470
00:27:11,246 --> 00:27:12,873
Now here.

471
00:27:13,648 --> 00:27:16,708
l've written letters to my
husband addressed from various ports.

472
00:27:17,185 --> 00:27:20,018
Please be sure to mail them one by one
at each place you stop.

473
00:27:20,188 --> 00:27:22,554
-That ought to convince him.
-lt's a cinch.

474
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,386
Well, goodbye again
and good luck to you.

475
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,858
Oh, l almost forgot
the most important thing.

476
00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:29,257
How do you feel about men?

477
00:27:29,431 --> 00:27:33,060
They're grand.
l mean, they're the most important thing.

478
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:36,226
With your figure and my name,
the men will be flocking after you.

479
00:27:36,671 --> 00:27:39,367
Say, that's happened to me plenty
under my own name.

480
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:42,101
Well, just remember,
while your lips are being kissed...

481
00:27:42,277 --> 00:27:44,074
...it's my reputation that's suffering.

482
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:46,577
-Yeah, l'll make a note of that.
-Good.

483
00:27:47,449 --> 00:27:49,644
Oh, dear, l'm liable
to be trapped on the boat.

484
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:52,479
-Well, goodbye, Georgia.
-Goodbye.

485
00:27:52,654 --> 00:27:54,451
l hope you make me very proud of me.

486
00:27:54,622 --> 00:27:56,351
l'll try.

487
00:27:57,025 --> 00:28:00,188
Oh, do me a favor,
have a wonderful time...

488
00:28:00,362 --> 00:28:04,162
...but please stay in your cabin as much
as possible and as alone as possible.

489
00:28:04,332 --> 00:28:07,028
l'll make a note of that too
and underline it.

490
00:28:07,202 --> 00:28:08,726
Bye.

491
00:28:16,578 --> 00:28:19,240
All ashore that's going ashore.

492
00:28:23,151 --> 00:28:25,346
What's the matter with you?

493
00:28:37,265 --> 00:28:39,665
-What's the matter with you?
-l think l forget.

494
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:41,358
-Forget what?
-l for--

495
00:28:43,938 --> 00:28:44,927
Nothing at all.

496
00:28:45,273 --> 00:28:46,331
l think l get seasick.

497
00:28:46,508 --> 00:28:50,137
-The ship isn't even moving.
-Why didn't you tell me that?

498
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,418
Late for work, aren't you?

499
00:29:03,591 --> 00:29:06,287
Could you tell me what table
Mrs. Elvira Kent has reserved?

500
00:29:06,461 --> 00:29:08,361
Table 64.
ls that where you're stationed?

501
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,589
-What do you mean?
-Aren't you a new waiter?

502
00:29:10,765 --> 00:29:12,426
Me? Certainly not. l'm a passenger.

503
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,091
l've got one of the most
luxurious cabins on the boat.

504
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,931
-l beg your pardon.
-You should.

505
00:29:17,105 --> 00:29:19,335
lf l were not a headwaiter,
l'd be flustered.

506
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,935
-What gave you the idea l work here?
-lt was a mistake.

507
00:29:23,144 --> 00:29:25,977
You see, onboard,
no one dresses the first night out.

508
00:29:28,082 --> 00:29:31,074
Well, what's good enough for you
is good enough for me.

509
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:47,634
Oh, l'm so sorry.

510
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,943
-My dear young lady.
-Yes?

511
00:29:57,111 --> 00:29:59,909
l advise you to go to your cabin
and get out of your clothes.

512
00:30:00,081 --> 00:30:01,446
-Pardon?
-Don't go in there.

513
00:30:01,616 --> 00:30:04,084
-You'll be frightfully embarrassed.
-Embarrassed? Why?

514
00:30:04,252 --> 00:30:06,482
-Nobody dresses the first night out.
-They don't?

515
00:30:07,755 --> 00:30:09,723
Even if it's chilly?

516
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,381
This l gotta see.

517
00:30:22,637 --> 00:30:26,073
-You mean nobody dresses up.
-Of course. Didn't you know that?

518
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,766
Then what are you doing
in that monkey suit?

519
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,101
Confidentially, this is my first trip too.

520
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,268
-Really?
-Yes.

521
00:30:32,447 --> 00:30:36,440
My dear man, l've been on more world
cruises than you could shake a stick at.

522
00:30:36,618 --> 00:30:40,179
lt's just that compared to my other gowns,
l don't consider this very formal.

523
00:30:40,355 --> 00:30:41,379
ls that so?

524
00:30:41,556 --> 00:30:45,549
Well, if you don't consider that formal,
l'd like to see the rest of your wardrobe.

525
00:30:45,994 --> 00:30:49,088
-Mrs. Elvira Kent.
-ln particular, l have one little item...

526
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,289
-...that's backless, strapless...
-Mrs. Kent.

527
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:52,797
-...almost frontless.
-Mrs. Kent.

528
00:30:53,368 --> 00:30:55,097
Mrs. Elvira Kent.

529
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,363
Oh, my goodness.
Mrs. Elvira Kent, that's me.

530
00:30:57,539 --> 00:30:59,268
Hey, boy.

531
00:31:00,408 --> 00:31:03,002
-Are you Mrs. Kent?
-Natch. l mean, naturally.

532
00:31:03,177 --> 00:31:04,769
-Radiogram.
-Oh, thank you.

533
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,072
-Just a moment.
-May l?

534
00:31:06,247 --> 00:31:08,511
No, no, l'll take care of it.
Thank you very much.

535
00:31:08,683 --> 00:31:09,672
Thank you.

536
00:31:09,851 --> 00:31:11,785
-Thank you.
-That's all right.

537
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,181
l'm told l overtip.

538
00:31:13,354 --> 00:31:14,844
Really?

539
00:31:15,189 --> 00:31:17,589
-Would you excuse me, please?
-Yes, certainly.

540
00:31:20,361 --> 00:31:23,159
''Don't dress first night out.''
Now she tells me.

541
00:31:23,331 --> 00:31:27,199
Mrs. Kent, now that l know your name,
perhaps it's fair you should know mine.

542
00:31:27,368 --> 00:31:28,801
-lmmaterial.
-lt's Peter Virgil.

543
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,302
l was wondering if you're as hungry
as Mr. Virgil.

544
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:33,440
l could eat a cow.

545
00:31:34,008 --> 00:31:37,102
Well, then our dress notwithstanding,
will you have dinner with me?

546
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:39,303
lf l'm overdressed,
l might as well overeat.

547
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,471
Unless you've some other
dinner engagement?

548
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:42,638
Oh, no, no, no.

549
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:45,308
Oh, now, surely you must have
some friends onboard.

550
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:46,783
l don't mean male friends.

551
00:31:46,955 --> 00:31:49,287
l mean, girlfriends
often go on cruises together.

552
00:31:49,457 --> 00:31:51,322
l don't know a soul on this tub.

553
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,827
Except Mr. Peter Virgil.

554
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:57,928
Well then, chin up, eyes straight ahead,
and what care we if the peasants stare.

555
00:31:58,099 --> 00:31:59,862
Carry on.

556
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,828
Oh, waiter.

557
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,564
Come here. Table for two, please.

558
00:32:07,742 --> 00:32:09,903
l'm sorry,
the dining room's just been closed.

559
00:32:10,078 --> 00:32:11,238
What do you mean closed?

560
00:32:11,412 --> 00:32:15,314
First you ritz me, then you try to starve
two perfectly good paying customers.

561
00:32:15,483 --> 00:32:16,973
The man is only doing his duty.

562
00:32:17,151 --> 00:32:20,609
-After all, it's our fault that we dawdled.
-Did we dawdle?

563
00:32:20,788 --> 00:32:22,312
Just the same, thanks ever so.

564
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:25,550
Why don't you try the cocktail lounge?
The pretzels are delicious.

565
00:32:26,661 --> 00:32:30,324
That's an excellent suggestion.
l'm famished.

566
00:32:35,503 --> 00:32:37,733
-More pretzels, please.
-More pretzels. Yes, sir.

567
00:32:37,905 --> 00:32:39,202
Yes, thank you.

568
00:32:40,074 --> 00:32:42,167
Tell me, Mr. Virgil,
what business are you in?

569
00:32:42,343 --> 00:32:44,868
l stick my nose
into other people's business.

570
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:48,243
-You know how it is when a man's retired.
-Retired? Retired from what?

571
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:50,646
l made my fortune
in the entertainment business.

572
00:32:50,818 --> 00:32:51,876
Oh, really?

573
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:55,284
l invented a new system
for clearing audiences out of theaters.

574
00:32:55,456 --> 00:32:57,822
-You're cute. You know something?
-Thank you. What?

575
00:32:57,992 --> 00:33:00,688
-l've always had an ambition to be a singer.
-ls that so?

576
00:33:00,862 --> 00:33:03,854
Most singers have secret ambitions
to be society dames.

577
00:33:04,032 --> 00:33:07,126
l don't see why you're wasting your time
with a married woman...

578
00:33:07,301 --> 00:33:10,270
-...when there's many attractive single girls.
-Oh, yes, yes.

579
00:33:10,438 --> 00:33:14,374
The single girls look for husbands, while
married women run from their husbands.

580
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:18,410
Frankly, l'd rather be with those that are
running than with those that are looking.

581
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:19,910
Don't you want to be married?

582
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:23,380
Well, most husbands l know
speak very poorly of marriage.

583
00:33:23,551 --> 00:33:25,849
-What of your marriage?
-Would you believe it?

584
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:29,012
-l haven't felt married.
-Yours must be a very unusual marriage.

585
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,248
lt certainly is.

586
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,859
l think we had quite enough dinner,
thank you.

587
00:33:35,963 --> 00:33:37,760
What would you like to do now?

588
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,162
l wish l could.

589
00:33:43,137 --> 00:33:45,264
lsn't that lovely?

590
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:56,245
-Hello.
-Good evening.

591
00:33:56,718 --> 00:33:59,084
-Oh, and you do sing?
-A little.

592
00:33:59,253 --> 00:34:01,084
-You know this song?
-Yes.

593
00:34:01,255 --> 00:34:05,385
-Could you raise it a little, please?
-Sure. B flat, fellas.

594
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:10,988
It's you or no one for me

595
00:34:11,165 --> 00:34:15,966
I'm sure of this
Each time we kiss

596
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,162
The lady's in love

597
00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:23,276
Now and forever
And when forever's done

598
00:34:23,444 --> 00:34:28,711
You'll find that you are still the one

599
00:34:29,717 --> 00:34:31,309
-Please
-The lady said please

600
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,387
Don't say no to my plea

601
00:34:34,555 --> 00:34:36,989
'Cause if you do

602
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:41,720
Then I'm all through

603
00:34:41,896 --> 00:34:46,299
There's this about you

604
00:34:46,467 --> 00:34:53,703
My world's an empty world without you

605
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:57,072
It's you or no one

606
00:34:57,245 --> 00:34:59,839
She don't want no one

607
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:03,780
It's you or no one for me

608
00:35:05,386 --> 00:35:07,980
Baby, you're the one for me

609
00:35:13,294 --> 00:35:16,627
-l shouldn't have done that.
-l won't report you to the Social Register.

610
00:35:16,798 --> 00:35:20,859
l'm bored with it all, strictly entre nous.
l wish l didn't have to keep up appearances.

611
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,868
Oh, l'm tired of pretending too.
Let's both let our hair down.

612
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:27,496
Let's follow our impulses wherever
they lead and make this a real vacation.

613
00:35:27,675 --> 00:35:29,666
l think you've got something there.

614
00:35:29,844 --> 00:35:31,675
-May l?
-Of course.

615
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,646
Anything above the third rib
l consider formal.

616
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,821
-Mrs. Kent?
-Yes?

617
00:35:49,997 --> 00:35:52,557
-l mean, Elvira.
-Yes?

618
00:35:54,135 --> 00:35:55,932
May l see you to your cabin?

619
00:35:56,103 --> 00:35:57,900
-Well--
-For you, Mrs. Kent.

620
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,131
Thank you.
Would you tip him, please?

621
00:36:00,308 --> 00:36:01,798
-Yes.
-l overtip.

622
00:36:01,976 --> 00:36:04,171
Oh, yes, of course. That's right.

623
00:36:11,319 --> 00:36:12,809
Well?

624
00:36:13,521 --> 00:36:16,285
No, thank you, Mr. Virgil.
l'll find my way alone.

625
00:36:16,457 --> 00:36:19,483
So nice meeting you. Good night.

626
00:36:45,686 --> 00:36:47,551
-Really?
-Yes.

627
00:37:15,283 --> 00:37:18,275
The tourist trade, the tourist trade

628
00:37:18,452 --> 00:37:20,682
Aye, it's all for the tourist trade

629
00:37:20,855 --> 00:37:23,551
We never sunbathe
Tell you why

630
00:37:23,724 --> 00:37:26,249
It's atmosphere for the passerby

631
00:37:26,427 --> 00:37:29,021
To find us asleep in the shade

632
00:37:29,196 --> 00:37:31,664
It's so very necessary

633
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:34,130
Aye, the tourist trade

634
00:37:34,302 --> 00:37:36,702
The tourist trade, the tourist trade

635
00:37:37,371 --> 00:37:39,396
Aye, it's all for the tourist trade

636
00:37:39,573 --> 00:37:42,235
Our souvenirs are all foreign bought

637
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:44,970
They come from some place
Called Terre Haute

638
00:37:45,146 --> 00:37:47,842
We can't sell a thing that we've made

639
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:50,779
Please, no arguin'
It's a bargain

640
00:37:50,952 --> 00:37:52,920
Aye, the tourist trade

641
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:57,250
Habana is Havana

642
00:37:57,425 --> 00:37:58,790
They murder the language

643
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,485
But we love 'em
We want more of 'em

644
00:38:01,662 --> 00:38:03,755
The Yankee dollar ain't hay

645
00:38:03,931 --> 00:38:05,193
Hey, hey

646
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:09,393
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey

647
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:12,671
The tourist trade, the tourist trade

648
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,967
Aye, it's all for the tourist trade

649
00:38:15,142 --> 00:38:17,906
If you're romantic
The Cuban stars

650
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,547
Are made to order for soft guitars

651
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,513
You must fall in love when they're played

652
00:38:23,684 --> 00:38:26,482
They inspire
They're for hire

653
00:38:26,654 --> 00:38:30,055
Aye
Aye, the tourist trade

654
00:38:31,459 --> 00:38:33,893
Habana

655
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,619
That's Havana.

656
00:38:35,796 --> 00:38:37,195
They murder the language

657
00:38:37,365 --> 00:38:39,833
But we love 'em
We want more of 'em

658
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:42,265
The Yankee dollar ain't hay

659
00:38:42,436 --> 00:38:43,767
Hey, hey.

660
00:38:43,938 --> 00:38:47,806
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey

661
00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:50,978
The tourist trade, the tourist trade

662
00:38:51,145 --> 00:38:53,409
Aye, it's all for the tourist trade

663
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,516
If you're romantic
The Cuban stars

664
00:38:56,684 --> 00:38:58,914
Made to order for soft guitars

665
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,884
You must fall in love when they're played

666
00:39:02,056 --> 00:39:04,957
They inspire
They're for hire

667
00:39:05,126 --> 00:39:09,187
Aye
Aye, the tourist trade

668
00:39:10,297 --> 00:39:12,891
It's a settin'
Past forgettin'

669
00:39:13,067 --> 00:39:15,331
Once you see it
You'll agree

670
00:39:15,503 --> 00:39:19,735
It's all for the tourist trade

671
00:39:23,044 --> 00:39:24,944
Hey, I love that stuff

672
00:39:35,823 --> 00:39:36,949
Hello, New York?

673
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,217
Havana calling Mr. Michael Kent.

674
00:39:39,393 --> 00:39:42,385
Plaza 43444.

675
00:39:42,596 --> 00:39:44,655
Desires to reverse charges.

676
00:39:44,999 --> 00:39:46,557
Reverse charges?

677
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:49,492
Just one moment, please.

678
00:39:51,872 --> 00:39:55,103
Havana calling, Mr. Kent.
Wishes to reverse the charges.

679
00:39:55,943 --> 00:39:58,138
Oh, yes. l'll accept it.

680
00:40:03,951 --> 00:40:05,145
Hello.

681
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,549
Yes, yes, l'll accept the charges.

682
00:40:07,721 --> 00:40:10,019
-Hello. Who?
-lt's me, Peter Virgil.

683
00:40:10,191 --> 00:40:12,955
We're in Havana.
l thought l'd call and give you the news.

684
00:40:13,127 --> 00:40:16,255
Yes, yes, of course.
Well, what is the news?

685
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,193
-No news.
-What do you mean ''no news ''?

686
00:40:18,365 --> 00:40:21,766
She hasn't looked at another man.
Professionally, l'm very disappointed.

687
00:40:21,936 --> 00:40:23,631
Well, personally, l'm not.

688
00:40:23,804 --> 00:40:25,795
You mean she hasn't spoken
to another man?

689
00:40:26,474 --> 00:40:27,634
Well, she's spoken to me.

690
00:40:27,808 --> 00:40:30,675
What? You two
know each other already?

691
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,006
Well, naturally,
I had to make her acquaintance.

692
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,011
Well, was it difficult?

693
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:37,047
Tell me, who spoke first?

694
00:40:37,218 --> 00:40:39,083
l did--
Look, don't worry.

695
00:40:39,253 --> 00:40:41,721
The slogan of my firm is
''Never kiss a client's wife.''

696
00:40:42,156 --> 00:40:44,147
Well, don't change slogans
in mid-ocean.

697
00:40:46,293 --> 00:40:49,285
-Hello, is this Mrs. Elvira Kent?
-Yes.

698
00:40:49,463 --> 00:40:51,829
lt is? Well, this is
Mrs. Elvira Kent speaking.

699
00:40:51,999 --> 00:40:55,196
Oh, excuse me, this is Georgia,
Georgia Garrett.

700
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,860
l'm taking my work so seriously
l don't know who l am.

701
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,370
Good. Have you been sticking
close to your cabin?

702
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,669
Have I? I've only spoken to one man,
and he's harmless, quite.

703
00:41:03,844 --> 00:41:05,641
l thought l warned you about that.

704
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:10,081
l figured if l don't speak to any men at all,
it's sure to attract attention to me.

705
00:41:10,251 --> 00:41:12,845
Oh, by the way, Mrs. Kent,
l know it's not my business...

706
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,715
...but have you got anything
on your husband?

707
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,046
l'm afraid his conduct
has been impeccable.

708
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:20,284
-Caught him with the goods.
-That means he's been behaving himself.

709
00:41:20,461 --> 00:41:24,022
Too bad. Well, maybe he'll do something
unimpeccable before l come back.

710
00:41:24,932 --> 00:41:27,423
Goodbye. And look,
keep in touch with me, will you?

711
00:41:27,601 --> 00:41:29,694
Okay. Goodbye.

712
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:36,736
l thought you were waiting outside.

713
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,243
Well, l suddenly remembered
l had to call New York.

714
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:42,280
-Girlfriend, huh?
-No, no, business. And you?

715
00:41:42,449 --> 00:41:44,508
l was calling New York too.

716
00:41:44,952 --> 00:41:48,479
-Boyfriend, huh?
-Better than a boyfriend. My husband.

717
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,590
-You were talking to your husband just now?
-l just hung up.

718
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,388
-Does that surprise you?
-Yes, it certainly does. l--

719
00:41:55,563 --> 00:41:57,724
Poor darling.
He was home waiting for my call.

720
00:41:57,898 --> 00:42:00,423
He's quite a treasure.
l think l'll send him a letter.

721
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,398
Well, don't you have to write it first?

722
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:05,698
Oh, no, l'm way ahead
on my letter writing.

723
00:42:06,907 --> 00:42:08,067
Bless his heart.

724
00:42:08,242 --> 00:42:10,938
-Look, do you see a doorway over there?
-Sure.

725
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:13,739
-Do you hear somebody singing?
-Sure.

726
00:42:13,914 --> 00:42:17,350
Well, then l guess l'm not crazy.
Shall we absorb some of the local color?

727
00:42:17,518 --> 00:42:19,076
Let's.

728
00:42:23,557 --> 00:42:25,582
Table for two, please.

729
00:42:37,404 --> 00:42:40,168
Bring us a couple of drinks
of something tall and cool.

730
00:42:40,341 --> 00:42:42,036
Oh, Havana. lsn't it romantic?

731
00:42:42,209 --> 00:42:43,233
You know,
you amaze me.

732
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:46,777
You made this trip 1 00 times,
yet you make it sound like it's the first.

733
00:42:46,947 --> 00:42:48,175
You know what my secret is?

734
00:42:48,349 --> 00:42:49,873
-No, what?
-No.

735
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:51,608
No, come on, tell me.

736
00:42:51,785 --> 00:42:55,016
Well, l keep telling myself
this is my first trip.

737
00:43:28,555 --> 00:43:30,648
Pedro, you must teach me that song.

738
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,084
Oh, you speak Spanish.

739
00:43:35,062 --> 00:43:36,529
Just like a native.

740
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:40,155
We have so many requests for this song.
And l have some English lyrics.

741
00:43:40,334 --> 00:43:42,894
-Oh, thank you.
-Will be 25 cents, please.

742
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:46,096
The tourist trade.
Aye, the tourist trade.

743
00:43:54,748 --> 00:43:58,684
You sigh, the song begins

744
00:43:58,852 --> 00:44:03,789
You speak and I hear violins

745
00:44:03,957 --> 00:44:06,619
It's magic

746
00:44:08,162 --> 00:44:11,222
The stars desert the skies

747
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:16,062
And rush to nestle in your eyes

748
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,602
It's magic

749
00:44:18,772 --> 00:44:23,072
Without a golden wand

750
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:27,236
Or mystic charms

751
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:31,373
Fantastic things begin

752
00:44:31,552 --> 00:44:38,549
When I am in your arms

753
00:44:40,627 --> 00:44:44,119
When we walk hand in hand

754
00:44:44,298 --> 00:44:48,826
The world becomes a wonderland

755
00:44:49,002 --> 00:44:51,596
It's magic

756
00:44:52,973 --> 00:44:58,275
How else can I explain those rainbows

757
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:01,175
When there is no rain?

758
00:45:01,348 --> 00:45:03,942
It's magic

759
00:45:04,418 --> 00:45:08,377
Why do I tell myself

760
00:45:08,555 --> 00:45:10,785
These things that happen

761
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:16,362
Are all really true?

762
00:45:17,164 --> 00:45:22,761
When in my heart I know the magic

763
00:45:23,404 --> 00:45:30,401
Is my love for you

764
00:45:31,011 --> 00:45:33,241
Gee, now, that's a beautiful song.

765
00:45:35,616 --> 00:45:39,211
It's magic

766
00:45:40,621 --> 00:45:44,648
There's something about the way you sing,
l don't know, it does something to me.

767
00:45:46,126 --> 00:45:49,186
It's magic

768
00:45:49,363 --> 00:45:53,299
Why do I tell myself

769
00:45:53,467 --> 00:45:55,401
These things that happen

770
00:45:55,569 --> 00:46:01,701
Are all really true?

771
00:46:02,576 --> 00:46:06,410
-When in my heart I know
-When in my heart I know

772
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:20,551
-The magic is my love for you
-The magic is my love for you

773
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,434
Here you are.

774
00:46:39,813 --> 00:46:41,974
-Will you have dinner with me tonight?
-Why not?

775
00:46:42,149 --> 00:46:44,515
We've had it together
every night so far.

776
00:46:44,685 --> 00:46:46,778
-Just a moment, sir.
-l gotta catch that boat.

777
00:46:46,954 --> 00:46:48,649
Your tickets.

778
00:46:49,256 --> 00:46:50,518
Don't you trust me?

779
00:46:50,691 --> 00:46:51,817
Your table or mine?

780
00:46:51,992 --> 00:46:54,017
Say, l've got an idea.
What about table nine?

781
00:46:54,194 --> 00:46:56,253
-Table nine?
-That's in a nice dark corner.

782
00:46:57,731 --> 00:47:00,461
-Georgia.
-What's the matter?

783
00:47:00,634 --> 00:47:04,126
Nothing. lf l'm gonna be ready in time,
l'd better start dressing right now.

784
00:47:04,304 --> 00:47:06,829
-Wait a minute. What's the hurry?
-l'll see you later.

785
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:12,473
Georgia.

786
00:47:29,997 --> 00:47:31,521
May l help you, sir?

787
00:47:31,698 --> 00:47:35,327
Well, you're not exactly my type,
but you can take my bags.

788
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:41,669
-Good evening, madam.
-Good evening.

789
00:47:41,842 --> 00:47:44,572
-Did you give the message to Mr. Virgil?
-Yes, madam.

790
00:47:44,745 --> 00:47:48,010
l told him that you weren't having dinner
because you were indisposed.

791
00:47:48,181 --> 00:47:50,012
-Thank you.
-Yes, madam.

792
00:47:50,183 --> 00:47:53,812
-Did you bring a little herring?
-Yes, madam. Marinated.

793
00:47:55,255 --> 00:47:58,053
The purse is right over there,
help yourself.

794
00:48:02,729 --> 00:48:04,560
lt's all right, l overtip.

795
00:48:04,731 --> 00:48:06,562
Thank you so much, ma'am.

796
00:48:16,043 --> 00:48:19,137
-Who is it?
-lt's me, Peter. How do you feel?

797
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,678
Terrible. Just terrible.

798
00:48:20,847 --> 00:48:23,077
Well, we'll fix you right up.
l brought a doctor.

799
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:25,741
l don't need a doctor.
l just want to be left alone.

800
00:48:25,919 --> 00:48:28,683
But l can't stand in this passageway
all night, young lady.

801
00:48:28,855 --> 00:48:31,653
lt's drafty,
and l'm catching cold.

802
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,554
Take two aspirins and go to bed.

803
00:48:33,727 --> 00:48:36,787
Thank you very much.
lt sounds like a very good idea. l'll do that.

804
00:48:36,964 --> 00:48:38,761
But first, l'll have to examine you.

805
00:48:38,932 --> 00:48:40,900
lt might be something contagious,
you know.

806
00:48:41,068 --> 00:48:43,002
All right, doctor. Just a minute.

807
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:48,168
Come in.

808
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:51,869
You better stay outside.
We don't want to start an epidemic.

809
00:48:55,415 --> 00:48:57,406
Now, tell me, where does it hurt?

810
00:48:57,584 --> 00:48:58,608
Everywhere.

811
00:48:58,785 --> 00:49:02,016
Oh, well, then, l suppose
we should start looking someplace.

812
00:49:02,556 --> 00:49:05,252
-Yes, let me see your tongue.
-What's the matter?

813
00:49:05,425 --> 00:49:09,225
Oh, l get dizzy when l bend.
l must be coming down with something.

814
00:49:09,396 --> 00:49:13,389
Oh, thank you very much, yes.
Oh, may l feel your pulse?

815
00:49:13,567 --> 00:49:14,659
Yes.

816
00:49:14,835 --> 00:49:16,132
You might as well feel mine.

817
00:49:16,803 --> 00:49:19,135
lf you'd be so kind. Thank you.

818
00:49:21,339 --> 00:49:23,102
Yes, your pulse is normal.

819
00:49:23,274 --> 00:49:24,400
Yours is fast.

820
00:49:24,575 --> 00:49:26,202
l was sure of it.

821
00:49:26,377 --> 00:49:29,141
Well, l suppose
l ought to tap something.

822
00:49:31,082 --> 00:49:33,380
-Here.
-Oh, thank you so much.

823
00:49:34,352 --> 00:49:36,320
Now say, ''Ah.''

824
00:49:39,724 --> 00:49:42,386
-My diagnosis was correct.
-What do you recommend, doctor?

825
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,720
-A sea voyage.
-A sea--

826
00:49:43,895 --> 00:49:46,887
But then we're on one, aren't we?
l'm so sorry. How silly of me.

827
00:49:47,065 --> 00:49:49,431
l'll give you an injection
and put you to sleep.

828
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,261
That shouldn't do you any harm.

829
00:49:51,436 --> 00:49:52,869
Will it hurt, doctor?
