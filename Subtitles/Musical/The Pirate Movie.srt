1
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,110
Raise the flag of piracy

2
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,471
sing a song of victory

3
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,310
For glorious in battle are we

4
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,678
We've never known defeat
we never will retreat

5
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,228
We live to hear the cannon roar

6
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,397
And terror is our semaphore

7
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,277
Notoriously loathsome are we

8
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,715
We rob the rich, the poor
then steal a little more

9
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,231
Victory, we fight to win

10
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,557
Victory is ours again

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,151
We are the scourge of the land and sea

12
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,914
Beastly pirates are we

13
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,196
Masters of the briny sea

14
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,791
We'll go down in history

15
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,789
Courageous men who live by the sword

16
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,077
We deal in treachery, the kings of lechery

17
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,435
Raise the anchor, trim the sail

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,989
We raid tonight if winds prevail

19
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,316
Invincible, we fight to the end

20
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,959
United to a man, we need no battle plan

21
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,516
Victory, we fight to win

22
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,592
Victory is ours again

23
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,396
We are the scourge of the land and sea

24
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,279
Beastly pirates are we

25
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,435
It's so pitiful a sight
to see them walk the plank

26
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,830
They squirm and cry for mercy
regardless of their rank

27
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,552
Victory we fight to win

28
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,036
Victory is ours again

29
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,710
For we are the scourge of the land and sea

30
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,871
Beastly pirates are we

31
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,872
Victory, we fight to win

32
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,312
Victory is ours again

33
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,990
We are the scourge of the land and sea

34
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,192
Beastly pirates are we

35
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,188
Victory

36
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,797
That's how they did it in Hollywood...

37
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,555
with stars like Errol Flynn
and Douglas Fairbanks.

38
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,269
Join me on the deck of the ship
for the second part of the show.

39
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,552
We'll show you how the pirates
really did it. A little sword fight.

40
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,551
Okay, join me up there.

41
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,910
Come along now, over here!

42
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,836
Introducing pirate gold.
Get your pirate gold.

43
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,070
We're giving them away free.

44
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,718
Lovely ice cream.

45
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,799
And you, sir. A lovely free sample.

46
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,913
Bless you. Thank you, my child. 'Bye.

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,433
I'm with them.

48
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,590
Turn that thing down, okay?

49
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,352
Come on, hurry up!

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,230
Ladies, anybody want
to learn swordsmanship...

51
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,356
from the master of cut and thrust?

52
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,590
Lunge and parry? In and out?

53
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,079
Yeah!

54
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,673
She'll do it.

55
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,509
You guys!

56
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,592
Here you are. Come on up here. That's it.

57
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,949
Sorry.

58
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,879
Not bad. Guess you'll have to do.
What's your name?

59
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,188
Mabel!

60
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,670
Okay, Mabel, get the stick up.

61
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,275
Olé.

62
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,392
Here, look. First...

63
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,278
atta girl, put both hands around.
Two hands together.

64
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,398
And it's not olé, it's touché.

65
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,238
Meaning "touch."

66
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,069
Touch.

67
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,754
Now, less than a hundred years ago...

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,834
pirates really operated around here,
raping and pillaging.

69
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,353
I'd hate to be pillaged.

70
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,512
Killing! Note the footwork!

71
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,510
Feint so, lunge so, and...

72
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,436
my point penetrates you.

73
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,957
Give her a hand, girls.
Way to go. Come on down.

74
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,272
- Hey, Myrtle...
- Mabel, okay?

75
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,154
Mabel, sorry. I'm taking my boat
over to Pirate Rock...

76
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,118
to do some skin diving, look for treasure.
Want to come?

77
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,716
Me? You're kidding.

78
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,913
No. I got a great boat.
Bunks and everything.

79
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,636
Bring some of your friends along.
It'll be great fun.

80
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,157
You, too? All of you?

81
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,870
Hey, stop it! Where's Mabel?

82
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,509
Quickly, let's get moving. Here she comes.

83
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,350
I thought you wouldn't make it.

84
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,472
Say good-bye, Mabel.

85
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,152
What's going on?

86
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,557
Stop fooling around.
You can't leave her there!

87
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,917
Good-bye!

88
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,270
Go play with your Barbie dolls!

89
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,432
Hey, wait! It's me. Mabel! Wait!

90
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,754
Hey!

91
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,992
Hey, you guys, wait!

92
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,749
Fire!

93
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,829
Fire!

94
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,268
Here they come!
I found your sword.

95
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,830
The last battle of Frederic's youth.
Isn't he wonderful?

96
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,390
Stand by to repel boarders!

97
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,317
Captain!

98
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,030
I told you to order Chinese,
but this is ridiculous!

99
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,916
Happy birthday.
Something special, Frederic. Look out!

100
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,678
One moment, lads.

101
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,112
He is their captain.

102
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,318
Spare me!

103
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,351
An Irish tenor no less.

104
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,670
We could use an Irish tenor, lads!

105
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,110
Soprano. Even better.

106
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,872
Set sail!

107
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,148
Oh, better far to live and die

108
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,912
Under the brave, black flag I fly

109
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,195
Than play a hypocritical part

110
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,840
With a pirate head and a pirate heart

111
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,669
Away to the world across the seas

112
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,675
Where pirates all have law degrees

113
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,671
But I'll be true to the song I sing

114
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,115
And live and die a Pirate King

115
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,792
For

116
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,514
I am a Pirate King

117
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,875
You are, hurrah for a Pirate King

118
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,190
And it is, it is a glorious thing

119
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,077
to be the Pirate King

120
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,713
I am a Pirate King

121
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,995
You are, hurrah for a Pirate King

122
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,196
And it is, it is a glorious thing

123
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,952
to be the Pirate King

124
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,110
It is, hurrah for a Pirate King

125
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,589
hurrah for the Pirate King

126
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,034
When I venture forth to seek my prey

127
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,395
I crush my foes in a royal way

128
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,119
The ladies yield and the ships go down

129
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,430
Or is it the other way around?

130
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,949
But many a king in a gilded tower

131
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,750
If he wants to cling to pomp and power

132
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,070
Must manage somehow to get through

133
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,435
More dirty work than ever I do

134
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,357
For I am a Pirate King

135
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,874
You are, hurrah for a Pirate King

136
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,110
And it is, it is a glorious thing

137
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,191
to be the Pirate King

138
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,952
I am a Pirate King

139
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,395
You are, hurrah for a Pirate King

140
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,755
And it is, it is a glorious thing

141
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,353
to be the Pirate King

142
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,431
It is, hurrah for a Pirate King

143
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,433
I am the Pirate King

144
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,356
He tore our goddamn sail again!

145
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,158
Sew that up, love.

146
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,719
Today, Frederic, you join us
as a full-fledged member of our band.

147
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,439
Your apprenticeship papers. 21 today.

148
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,068
Speech!

149
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,075
I'd hoped to spare you this.

150
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,958
Though as friends, I love you all.

151
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,392
But, today... Today I leave you forever.

152
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,154
What? Why, this is lunacy!

153
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,832
I cannot forget!

154
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,513
I cannot forget
it was cutthroats such as you...

155
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,398
who murdered my family
and left me an orphan.

156
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,879
Not fair, Freddy.

157
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,758
We're orphans ourselves.
We would never hurt an orphan.

158
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,239
Yes, I know.

159
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,997
But I fulfilled my contract...

160
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,958
and I feel honor-bound to devote myself...

161
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,634
heart and soul to your extermination!

162
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,076
Extermination? That sounds a little harsh.

163
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,833
Such is my sense of duty.

164
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,074
If you conscientiously feel
that it is your duty to destroy us...

165
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,479
we cannot blame you.

166
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,073
It's the way I've raised you.

167
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,637
I've been as low and vicious as I could.

168
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,156
But something inside...

169
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,676
tells me there's more to life. I know it!

170
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,558
More than piracy?

171
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,956
Lately, I've been restless.

172
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,391
I've been consumed by some inner fire.

173
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,996
All I think about is girls!

174
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,635
I've waited 20 years for this.

175
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,071
The sea, Frederic, is a jealous mistress.

176
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,391
But she is her own reward.

177
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,312
Believe me, you've missed nothing.

178
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,597
Have you missed anything
these 20 years at sea, men?

179
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,955
- Sex!
- What about love?

180
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,157
Love for a pirate is the kiss
of a salt wind, the curve of a white sail...

181
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,676
the whisper of an enemy's well-slit throat.
That's love, Frederic!

182
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,792
Show him, shipmates!

183
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,349
Dance! Dance!

184
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,710
I'll miss you. I'll miss you all very much.

185
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,919
But my mind is made up.

186
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,353
Oh, shit!

187
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,919
Then so be it.

188
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,597
My mistake. See you later.

189
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,514
I know you'll think me an old softy.

190
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,390
But in return for all your years
of loyal service...

191
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,354
I make you captain of your own ship.

192
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,549
I shall command her with pride...

193
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,433
and someday...

194
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,068
There's always the someday, Freddy.

195
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,390
Grab him!

196
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,315
Hang five, honky!

197
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,148
Climbing over rocky mountain
Skipping rivulet and fountain

198
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,949
Passing where the willows quiver

199
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,191
Passing where the willows quiver
By the ever-rolling river

200
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,474
Mabel!

201
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,035
Oh, let her be! Who needs her?

202
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,113
She's a disgrace to the noble name
of Stanley. Just look at her.

203
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,391
I wouldn't wear that dress to bed.

204
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,152
I think that's the whole idea.

205
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,673
Wash your mouth out.

206
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,672
What is she looking for?

207
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,875
Love.

208
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,031
She'll have a long wait.

209
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,954
She's the youngest and by noble custom,
the eldest must marry first.

210
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,474
- Which makes me first.
- Me second.

211
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,233
And me third.

212
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,397
Gee, we'll all be 50.

213
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,714
Let us gaily tread the measure

214
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,554
Make the most of fleeting leisure

215
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,871
Worship nature while we can

216
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,717
Far away from any man

217
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,870
Far away from any man

218
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,871
Make the most of fleeting leisure

219
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,757
Far away from any man

220
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,190
Climbing over rocky mountain

221
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,952
Do you believe that song?

222
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,635
Passing where the willows quiver

223
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,759
Passing where the willows quiver
By the ever-rolling river

224
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,196
Swollen with the summer rain
the summer rain

225
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,553
Let us gaily tread the measure
Make the most of fleeting leisure

226
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,712
Worship nature while we can

227
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,433
Let us gaily tread the measure
Make the most of fleeting leisure

228
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,751
Far away from any man

229
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,153
Let us gaily tread the measure
Make the most of fleeting leisure

230
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,153
Far away from any man
From any man

231
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,870
You always were a careless boy.

232
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,669
Thank you.

233
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,472
By the way,
was it a definite no back there?

234
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,191
I don't want to hurt your feelings...

235
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,236
but tell me honestly...

236
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,438
compared to other women,
are you beautiful?

237
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,552
I've been told so.

238
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,239
But lately?

239
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,750
By Samuel.
Of course he was drunk at the time.

240
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,233
Oh, Freddy!

241
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,756
Come on, girls, come in.

242
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,359
It's lovely and warm.

243
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,549
Hi!

244
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,238
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to deflower you!

245
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,919
Help! A pirate! Run for your lives!

246
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,234
Pirate?

247
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,357
No, I'm not anymore!

248
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,953
Ladies, I'm not a pirate.
I promise you.

249
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,716
Look, see? No tattoos, nothing! Girls!

250
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,112
When will I find love? Where will she be?

251
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,393
And if she's out there will she wait for me?

252
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,794
How will he know me? Will I know him?

253
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,033
Is there no end to all my questioning?

254
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,953
Can I believe

255
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,915
what I am seeing

256
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,190
what I am feeling?

257
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,155
Something so rare, watching her there

258
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,629
She makes my heart stall

259
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,912
Can I believe what I am feeling?

260
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,634
My head is reeling

261
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,991
He just looked my way

262
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,431
from the start I can say

263
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,750
I will give him everything

264
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,871
Strange emotions wash over me

265
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,397
Like the motion of the deepest sea

266
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,594
And I feel first love

267
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,548
You're all I've dreamed of

268
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,678
Love moves me inside

269
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,955
like the moon moves the tide

270
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,390
My first love

271
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,189
Some kind of miracle brought you here

272
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,318
Just when I'd given up hoping

273
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,075
From the moment when you first appeared

274
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,748
I could feel my whole life

275
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,149
opening in

276
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,390
First love

277
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,190
You're all I've dreamed of

278
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,310
Love moves me inside

279
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,870
like the moon moves the tide

280
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,548
My first love

281
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,160
My first love

282
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,677
And I promise to be true to you

283
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,357
My first love

284
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,474
Not bad.

285
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,469
Thanks.

286
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,316
Do you live around here?

287
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,756
I've never lived till now.

288
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,351
The good pirates arrived too late
to save my parents, bless their souls.

289
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,759
But my mother hurled me
through the flames into the King's arms...

290
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,478
and he raised me as his apprentice.

291
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,028
You poor thing. Pirates!

292
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,279
Like walking the plank, buried treasure,
off with his head, and the Jolly Richard?

293
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,554
Roger.

294
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,319
Roger, I love it.

295
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,992
No, Frederic, without a "k".

296
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,753
Mabel, also without a "k".
We've so much in common!

297
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,831
- Mabel.
- Pretty bad, huh?

298
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,479
No, I love it.

299
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,910
I know this sounds silly...

300
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,711
but I think I love you.

301
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,235
I might even want to marry you.

302
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,710
That was a short love scene...

303
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,154
but, yes.

304
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,519
Oh, no, we have a dumb custom.
There's got to be a way out.

305
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,359
We've got to see my father.

306
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,159
I haven't had much practice seeing fathers.

307
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,033
He's just like any other
ordinary major general.

308
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,997
Major general? Oh, no!

309
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,270
Frederic, trust me.

310
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,038
Wow. Come here.

311
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,149
I thought the bells came afterwards.

312
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,035
Helmsman, hard of...

313
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,793
Hard of...

314
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,478
Reverse! Hard of backwards. No.
Sam, what is that saying?

315
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,152
- Hard of hearing!
- Hard of...

316
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,957
The pirates have lust in their hearts.

317
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,952
Your sisters are in danger of their virtue,
even their lives!

318
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,077
Come back here,
you sex-crazed bilge rats!

319
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,318
This is mutiny!

320
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,431
Mabel, don't move!

321
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,390
A little close to the curb.

322
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,951
This is one time
when you're not going to rape...

323
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,231
pillage and plunder!

324
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,754
Really?

325
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,994
Take it easy, lads.
Don't hurt or maim them.

326
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,672
Oh-ho, Frederic!

327
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,629
Are your loins so hot
you'd have them all and none for us?

328
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,829
Who dares disturb our dalliance?

329
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,319
- I do!
- What?

330
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,317
Well, we've saved the best till last.

331
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,356
Keep out of this, Mabel!

332
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,638
You'll be hung!

333
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,479
I am, and very well, thank you.

334
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,313
Set Frederic and my sisters free or die!

335
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,109
Olé!

336
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,394
Touché!

337
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,669
Captain!

338
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,034
Here!

339
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,751
You see, the blade grows heavy.

340
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,717
She cannot raise it to my heart.

341
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,030
I'm not aiming at your heart.

342
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,954
I'll see you get a thousand lashes!

343
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,758
Promises, promises.

344
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,990
If you love half as well as you fight...

345
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,230
No! Mabel, tell him!

346
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,836
What could she say to foil our sport?

347
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,911
My father...
Yes?

348
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,991
Is...
Yes?

349
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,952
...a major general.

350
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,712
A major general?

351
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,076
- That'll do it.
- Yes, he's a major general!

352
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,879
Yes, he is a major general.

353
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,909
Yes, yes, I am a major general.

354
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,389
- Papa!
- Not now, darling, I'm on!

355
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,109
I am the very model
of a modern major general

356
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,509
I've information
vegetable, animal, and mineral

357
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,989
I know the kings of England
I quote the fights historical

358
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,116
From Marathon to Waterloo
In order categorical

359
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,270
I'm very well acquainted
with matters mathematical

360
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,476
I understand equations
both simple and quadratical

361
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,552
About binomial theorem
I am teeming with a lot of news

362
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,713
With many cheerful facts
about the square of the hypotenuse

363
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,039
Darling, this is my big number.
Now play along with this.

364
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,116
Our lives may depend on it.

365
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,274
I am very good
at integral and differential calculus

366
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,510
I know the scientific names
of beings animalculous

367
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,989
In short, in matters
vegetable, animal, and mineral

368
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,389
I am the very model
of a modern major general

369
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,353
Verse two.

370
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,749
I comprehend contemporary
culture North American

371
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,308
I straighten more piratical erections
than Bo Derek can

372
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,709
I'm into EST and all the rest
I've undergone analysis

373
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,950
I've jogged beyond decrepitude
to permanent paralysis

374
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,349
My muse is into music
With my credit I won't trouble you

375
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,715
From R&B to S&M, cross over C&W

376
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,315
To grooving with the Doobies
in my Malibu white-souling tones

377
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,391
Man, I'm older than the Beatles
but I'm younger than the Rolling Stones

378
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,309
My military knowledge
for I'm plucky and adventury

379
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,960
Embraces MASH and Star Wars
and the 22nd century

380
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,474
Yes, sir, in matters
vegetable, animal, and mineral

381
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,836
I am the very model
of a modern major general

382
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,396
Now that I've introduced myself...

383
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,189
I'd like some idea
of what's going on in my garden!

384
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,512
Papa, we, I mean, Frederic and I...

385
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,068
Permit me, sir. I'll explain in two words.

386
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,196
It's a beach party, and I'm Frankie Avalon.

387
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,838
And I'm Annette Funicello.

388
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,593
Don't listen to them. They're pirates!

389
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,950
The famous pirates of Penzance!

390
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,918
What? The pirates of Penzance?

391
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,754
The rogues who stole
my family's fortune on the high seas...

392
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,353
a score of years ago?

393
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,635
Our last score was years ago.

394
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,759
All except this gentleman.

395
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,469
He was a pirate, but he'll now go straight,
as my husband.

396
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,353
Hey, you fox!

397
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,749
I'll be the best man, naturally.

398
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,394
An idea.

399
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,352
Tell me, kind sir...

400
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,549
do you know what it is to be...

401
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,394
an orphan?

402
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,198
Oh, shit!

403
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,110
An orphan? And a fine singer, too.

404
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,350
You may go. You're all free.

405
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,953
Come, lads, we've a ship to float.
Free her keel, and raise that chain doodad.

406
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,918
- Anchor.
- No, Sam, just disappointment.

407
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,435
Another 20 years at sea
will ease this petty melancholy.

408
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,673
For I am the Pirate King
And I'll buy this orphan thing

409
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,671
We'll go away without dismay.

410
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,671
But we'll be returning.

411
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,156
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

412
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,431
I don't trust these guys.

413
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,033
Not that fine.

414
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,791
I'd thought I lost you.

415
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,437
I'll light a thousand candles
for the luck that kept you safe.

416
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,750
Luck? I almost took that twit.

417
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,798
You did well for a woman...

418
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,508
but now there's a man's work to be done.

419
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,553
I'll keep watch till the ship is gone.

420
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,669
Woman?

421
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,152
Papa!

422
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,989
About this custom.

423
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,230
Yes, what about this custom?

424
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,998
I'm the eldest at 23.

425
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,355
Thirty-three.

426
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,079
Back to the castle, the lot of you.

427
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,633
The custom is irrelevant.

428
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,315
Youngest or oldest, I cannot allow you
to marry this penniless adventurer.

429
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,389
Why not?

430
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,517
He's a nasty pirate person and besides...

431
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,949
he's poor.

432
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,596
They're anchoring outside the cove!

433
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,719
Common fellow.

434
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,153
But if he wasn't poor?

435
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,151
Diamonds, rubies, gold coins?

436
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,959
- What a nice boy.
- Even if it wasn't his money?

437
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,392
- For your happiness. Whose money?
- Your money.

438
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,040
The family treasures, stolen by the pirates.

439
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,678
Suppose Frederic recovered them...

440
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,354
minus expenses,
attorneys' fees, my commission...

441
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,793
If he fails?

442
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,393
If he fails, we'll shack up.

443
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,311
We swim out to the ship, board it...

444
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,517
get the stolen treasure
and swim back. Easy.

445
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,113
What's the matter?

446
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,475
I've never seen a woman like that before.

447
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,192
The body is an eight.

448
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,590
The brain is a 10. So let's go!

449
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,639
Where is it?

450
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,469
It's not here.

451
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,869
Well, where is it?

452
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,118
It fell overboard on some uncharted reef.

453
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,033
- But there is a map.
- Where?

454
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,917
- The King's got it.
- The King's got it.

455
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,115
How do we get it?

456
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,997
It's tattooed on his back!

457
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,432
But no one has seen it.
He never takes his shirt off in public.

458
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,751
- I'll make him take his shirt off.
- How?

459
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,795
Get something to write on
and meet me below.

460
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,669
Olé!

461
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,589
Sam?

462
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,152
Reveal yourself!

463
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,714
Or die!

464
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,834
Nymph!

465
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,548
Nymphet.

466
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,074
Nympho.

467
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,199
I was in the neighborhood
and saw your light on.

468
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,278
Today, you tried to kill me.

469
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,516
Some people send flowers.

470
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,352
I fancy a chap...

471
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,152
I try to kill him.

472
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:54,834
Come on, my little nymphet,
you can trust me.

473
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,277
Is that a dagger in your pocket
or are you just glad to see me?

474
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,918
Why don't you...

475
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,679
take off your shirt?

476
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,195
No.

477
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,753
Tell me.
What's the age of consent around here?

478
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,590
Eighteen.

479
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,318
Good. I'm old enough.

480
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,878
How about a drink first?

481
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,197
Let's get sloshed. Help yourself.
There's some on the windowsill.

482
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,109
Cheers.

483
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,553
Bottoms up.

484
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,790
Ladies' choice. I like that.

485
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,273
My love, put an old sailor
out of his misery.

486
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,715
Let's try taking your shirt off.

487
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,792
How about you first?

488
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,396
Because I'm shy, and I'm also a feminist.

489
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,516
That means the man goes first.

490
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,273
Wonderful. Nice to meet a woman
who knows her place.

491
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,914
Two hundred and two pushups a day.

492
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,551
I need some fresh air.

493
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,034
No!

494
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,788
Goose bumps. I've got goose bumps.

495
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,909
Pushups.

496
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,195
I recommend pushups.

497
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:46,112
I'll fix the window, then
we'll fix your goose bumps, my nympho.

498
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,239
I know all about art.
I just don't know what I like.

499
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,032
This is a very...

500
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,111
Surely you don't tease?

501
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,593
There's just one little thing
that I forgot to tell you.

502
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,874
Are you ready for this?
Go for it.

503
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,272
Oh, this is just perfect!

504
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,033
Those muscles.

505
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,197
I'm gonna faint.

506
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,398
That's so good. Perfect.

507
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,029
Just a little more to the left.
That's great. Yeah, I like that.

508
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,430
That's good. That's very good. I like that.

509
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,711
Just a little bit to the...

510
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,518
That's so good!

511
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,079
I can't stand it anymore.
If you don't stop, I'll die.

512
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,713
More! More!

513
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,233
That's wonderful. More.

514
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,593
Just a little to the left.

515
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,399
My God. Don't stop. This is incredible.

516
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,271
You are really turning me on, I must say.

517
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,952
This is wonderful.

518
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,268
Are you ready yet?

519
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,510
There's just one more thing.

520
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,669
There is?

521
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,911
You and your little games.

522
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,037
I love an interesting woman.

523
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,551
Where are you, my little nymphet?

524
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,471
Be gentle, Mabel.

525
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,477
Mabel, your goose bumps have grown.

526
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,676
So that was sex?
What's there to get so excited about?

527
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,593
Where's the map?
What are those things for?

528
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:28,273
I put a hole in the ship,
and it's sinking. They were my friends.

529
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,230
Look out! Raiders aboard!

530
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,399
Help!

531
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,548
Jump!
I hope it's not cold!

532
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,314
Cowards.

533
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,830
I can see you now! Stop swimming.
You'll regret this.

534
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,394
The boat is sinking. Sink! Sink!

535
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,952
Keep pumpin'
Blowin'

536
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,273
Hey, it's an old wives' story

537
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,799
Said it's an old wives' tale

538
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,313
I say that love is glory

539
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,958
I tell you love's so frail

540
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,913
Loving needs a bandage

541
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,840
and intensive care

542
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,751
And it's a disadvantage

543
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,073
when you're playin' fair

544
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:03,072
If you're treading water
and romance is on the slide

545
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,239
Don't you know you have to swallow

546
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,039
something more than water

547
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,519
It's your pride

548
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,550
I've huffed and puffed

549
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,759
Just to keep love going

550
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,672
I'm done, I've had enough

551
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,917
Of pumpin' and blowin'

552
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,877
- Keep pumpin'
- Blowin'

553
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,794
- Keep pumpin'
- Blowin'

554
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,398
You know a woman's labor

555
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,878
is never, ever done

556
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,670
So could you do me a favor

557
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,117
and, father, tell your son

558
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:51,628
If he's treading water
and romance is on the slide

559
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,358
Don't you know you have to swallow

560
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,954
something more than water

561
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,598
It's your pride

562
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,192
I've huffed and puffed

563
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,389
Just to keep love going

564
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,478
I'm done, I've had enough

565
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,396
Of pumpin' and blowin'

566
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,756
I've huffed and puffed

567
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,593
Just to keep love going

568
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,472
I'm done, I've had enough

569
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,633
Of pumpin' and blowin'

570
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,553
Keep pumpin'
Blowin'

571
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,473
Keep pumpin'
Blowin'

572
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,833
Papa, we're home.

573
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,354
Big surprise. Frederic, over here.

574
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,232
Right on cue.

575
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:57,439
There's more room over here.
Bring it over here. Right in the corner.

576
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,069
Yeah. You're gonna love this, Papa.
Right here, on the floor.

577
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,230
Actually, the table might be better...

578
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,675
because when we open it,
it'll look really great.

579
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,149
Look, we've restored the family fortune.

580
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,557
All your sentimental treasures,
gold bars, Krugerrands.

581
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,158
- Break?
- No. Just a little bent.

582
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,151
Pink ball in the corner pocket.

583
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,078
The pirates are at least 20 minutes
behind us.

584
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,112
Plenty of time
for your army to ambush them.

585
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,712
Army? What army?

586
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,509
I blew it.

587
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,797
Papa, Frederic will raise an army.

588
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:44,316
In yonder village, there are yeomen,
stout of limb and spirit...

589
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,914
dedicated to the rules of law, but...

590
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,594
they lack a leader.

591
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,511
Of course, you'll lead them.

592
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,712
What? Me?

593
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,396
No, my dear.
I've had my moments of glory.

594
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,878
Why be selfish? My boy, the job is yours.

595
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:05,475
Rid me of these villains
and Mabel's hand is yours...

596
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,278
not to mention the best parts.

597
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,950
I'll ride straight away
to lead these good men.

598
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,956
I've been at sea since I was one.
How would I know how to ride a horse?

599
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,035
Well, I gave it my best shot.

600
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,555
Famous last words, Frederic?

601
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,873
Tailor-made, Frederic.

602
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,110
If it's all the same to you...

603
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,832
I'd rather be buried at sea.

604
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,195
Ruth.

605
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,438
Plain old Ruth.

606
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,114
Here, Commander.

607
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,555
Come on, Ruth. Was I that bad to you?

608
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,359
Able seaperson Frederic, prepare to die.

609
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,429
No.

610
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,956
That was for the life preservers.

611
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,473
You're coming back with us.

612
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:00,314
No, because
I've sworn to vanquish you all!

613
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,676
Freddy, you'll be the death of me.

614
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,954
Gladly.

615
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:08,277
My once apprentice.
I taught you all you know.

616
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,075
Don't make me teach you how to die.

617
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,513
Geronimo!

618
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,635
What's the matter? Losing your grip?

619
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,479
Can't we find somewhere safe
to kill each other?

620
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,435
Careful.

621
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,278
You might cut yourself.

622
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,074
Cheers.

623
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,236
- Out of breath?
- Save yours. It may be your last.

624
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,473
Head of the family.

625
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,149
Get out of this one, Commander.

626
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,833
Hello, sailor.

627
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,196
We must stop meeting like this.

628
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,678
Drop it, or...

629
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,195
- Nuts!
- Them, too.

630
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,593
Why don't you get on
with what we came for?

631
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,713
Heart or throat?

632
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,995
Heart.

633
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,752
The Force, Frederic.

634
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,558
Remember the Force.

635
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,872
- Did I teach you that?
- No, I saw it in a movie.

636
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,672
Listen, you two...

637
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,949
Oh, men. Kill him now
and you'll never hear his secret.

638
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,632
Secret? What secret?

639
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,229
Very good.

640
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,351
Your deed of apprenticeship.

641
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,148
The fine print. Your date of birth?

642
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,596
- February 29, 1856.
- A leap year.

643
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,035
- I don't get it.
- You were apprenticed to us...

644
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,872
- Till my 21st year.
- No.

645
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,191
Until your 21st birthday.
Leap years are every four years.

646
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,909
Going by birthdays,
you're still only five and a quarter.

647
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,833
- What?
- I merely make you aware of it.

648
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,077
I leave the rest to your sense of duty.

649
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,953
Yes, duty.

650
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,275
Duty and honor are all I have.

651
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,270
That's the one good thing you taught me.

652
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,556
So whatever it costs me, I will do my duty.

653
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,229
Good lad.

654
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,718
Then I guess I must tell you.

655
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,870
General Stanley, Mabel's father...

656
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,717
he's got your treasure hidden here.

657
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,876
And he's raising an army
to slaughter you. Us.

658
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,076
A fight? Us? Splendid!

659
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,912
Nobody loves a stoolie.

660
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,992
Love? Oh, my God. Mabel.

661
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,511
Give me an hour to say farewell forever.

662
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:49,598
An hour? When I was your age,
I could say farewell three times in an hour.

663
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,040
But not forever.
We're taking the ladies with us.

664
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,395
What? Mabel would rather die.

665
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:59,189
That can be arranged.
We march on the castle tonight!

666
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,158
They are doomed!

667
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:20,433
I know she'll never understand

668
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,717
I gave my word before we met

669
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:29,313
So I just can't go breaking it

670
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:33,999
She'll say she thinks I'm out of touch

671
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:38,437
I've let my duty, honor bound

672
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:43,354
come between the love we've found

673
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,233
How can I live without her

674
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:52,355
when she's all I'm livin' for?

675
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,191
How can I live without her

676
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:00,277
live like I did before?

677
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:04,556
Now I can see through her eyes

678
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,870
how good love can be

679
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,759
How can I live without her

680
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,798
when she's gone?

681
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,432
No matter what the future brings

682
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,790
I'll hold the memories in my heart

683
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:34,069
No matter how long we're apart

684
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:39,352
She'll always be the only one

685
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:43,517
Her name forever on my lips

686
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:48,831
She's slipping through my fingertips

687
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,318
How can I live without her

688
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:57,157
when she's all I'm living for?

689
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:01,112
How can I live without her

690
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:05,595
live like I did before?

691
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,510
Now I can see through her eyes

692
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,670
how good love can be

693
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,997
How can I live without her?

694
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:21,076
How can I live without her?

695
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:26,470
How can I live without her
when she's gone?

696
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,239
When she's gone

697
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,438
She's all I'm living for

698
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:41,031
How can I live like I did before?

699
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,399
How can I live without her?

700
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,353
Live without who?

701
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,391
What are you doing in there?

702
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,751
Oh, hiding.

703
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,070
Hiding? My Frederic, hiding?

704
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:02,391
It cannot be the lionheart trembles
at the coming conflict.

705
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,272
My love, a wimp.

706
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,913
No, Mabel.

707
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,831
A terrible disclosure's been made.

708
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,194
Then zip it up.

709
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,197
You mean, when I'm 84,
you'll still be 21?

710
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:17,794
Could be fun.

711
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,553
No, Mabel.

712
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,598
The tragedy completely eludes you,
doesn't it?

713
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:28,916
Look, don't you see,
I won't even be able to marry you until...

714
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,672
1940!

715
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:39,434
You're not gay, are you?

716
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,749
No!

717
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,476
You and that Pirate King get around...

718
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:46,552
in those feminine pleated shirts
and all that leather.

719
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,151
Hey, I'm not prejudiced.

720
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,795
What has this country got a Navy for?
Screw them if they can't take a joke.

721
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,754
You're weird.

722
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:04,676
All kidding aside, Fred, tell me this.

723
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,673
Are you a virgin?

724
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,519
- I don't know.
- Near enough.

725
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,030
- But you'd have me die one?
- No!

726
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:22,439
You're putting your sense of duty
before me and the lives of my family.

727
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,993
But I have to.

728
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,756
It's my duty, that's all I know.

729
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,956
That's all I know.
Frederic!

730
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,473
These are the 1880s.

731
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:34,473
You cannot live by the outmoded class
conventions of the neo-imperialist society.

732
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:37,472
- Find your true center.
- What? You mean Zen piracy?

733
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,879
Have you ever worn a whalebone corset?

734
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:49,029
No, we established that, didn't we?
It chokes and strangles!

735
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,870
I won't be choked by someone else's
dumb ideas of custom and duty!

736
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,359
Would you, Harry?

737
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:59,150
Never to know the rich and wondrous
person beating and throbbing in me!

738
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:00,992
Can you see me throbbing?

739
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,719
I see.

740
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,238
I see, I'm throbbing, too.

741
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:11,234
Your duty is to us.
Tell him, Harry! To our love!

742
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,952
You know, you're right.

743
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,595
You're right. Love is everything!

744
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,757
Love is everything.
Now go massacre those oafs.

745
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,549
I can't.

746
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:40,719
You say you love me?

747
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:42,957
As midnight loves the moon.

748
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:47,630
But who am I?
You've only known me for a day or two.

749
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:51,352
I'm a sailor who spent all his life at sea...

750
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:55,309
and knows nothing, nothing about life...

751
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,189
or ladies.

752
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,039
Only love.

753
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,957
And if I should change to keep your love...

754
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,596
changing it just might lose it.

755
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:14,629
Then that's the bottom line?
To hold you, I have to let you go?

756
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,352
See you in 1940.

757
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,791
But I'll try for 1939.

758
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,438
Love, show me the way

759
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:52,032
when I am lost and hope begins to fade

760
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,673
Love, timeless and true

761
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:01,392
whenever I need strength I look to you

762
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,393
Tonight

763
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:09,590
My faith is strong enough

764
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:13,389
to see me through tonight

765
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,956
He's gotta trust in love

766
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,270
the way I do

767
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,839
We gotta hold on tight

768
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,390
tonight

769
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:29,953
Hold on

770
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:36,509
Nothing's gonna stop us
if we just believe in love

771
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,552
Hold on

772
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:44,633
There's nothing under heaven
we can't overcome

773
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,632
Hold on

774
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,909
Love, I see a way

775
01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:00,272
How the tide will turn
and the part I'll play

776
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,480
It's all part of a plan

777
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:09,393
You don't have to know or understand

778
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:12,352
Tonight

779
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:20,352
I'll see it all unfold
before my eyes, tonight

780
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:26,836
With fortune on my side

781
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:29,480
and love to guide me

782
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:33,196
The future is looking bright

783
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,350
tonight

784
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,754
Hold on

785
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:44,469
Nothing's gonna stop us
if we just believe in love

786
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,512
Hold on

787
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:52,673
There's nothing under heaven
we can't overcome

788
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,439
Hold on

789
01:03:56,520 --> 01:04:01,514
And though the road ahead
may be unknown

790
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:06,473
We'll make it if we hold on

791
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,593
Sorry, Meadows.

792
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,916
How the hell are you, Meadows?

793
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:35,034
Papa, Frederic has just
crossed over to the enemy.

794
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:37,475
There's barely time
for you to go lead our force.

795
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:39,790
Lead? I can't lead.

796
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,632
I'm planning strategy.

797
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:52,871
- Papa.
- Just a snort or two for courage.

798
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,274
Courage?

799
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,550
Well, I'm a theoretical soldier.

800
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,269
The very model of a modern major...

801
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,709
I am the very, very...

802
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,995
Won't go off. It's not loaded.

803
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,154
But you are.

804
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:25,155
Papa, I'm gonna lead our fearsome force
against the foe.

805
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,793
- How much to keep this quiet?
- Now, listen, young lady...

806
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:33,190
No, I'll tell you.
If we win, a full pardon for Frederic.

807
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,508
That's blackmail.

808
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,352
A full pardon.

809
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,352
Damn cheek!

810
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,594
With women leading armies,
we'll never have another decent war again.

811
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,990
So true. So true.

812
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,229
When the foeman bares his steel

813
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,472
We uncomfortable feel

814
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,590
And we find the wisest thing

815
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:19,590
Is to slap our chests and sing

816
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,430
For when threatened by the brutes

817
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,270
And your heart is in your boots

818
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:32,554
There is nothing brings it round
Like the trumpet's martial sound

819
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:35,558
Like the trumpet's martial sound

820
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:40,029
Tarantara! Tarantara!

821
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,988
Sergeant, approach! Pirates at large!

822
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:08,509
Pirates?

823
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,670
This is a day for death or glory.

824
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:15,197
That is not a pleasant way of putting it.

825
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:18,431
Take heart!
Frederic should've led you, but I shall!

826
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,750
Not bleeding likely. You're a girl.

827
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:22,639
Now, nick off.

828
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,637
Yes, nick off!

829
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,838
We'll see what your inspector
thinks of this!

830
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:40,514
One moment.

831
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,717
I must take some notes.

832
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:02,634
My notebook.

833
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,356
Name of the fugitive?

834
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,713
- "Ferzjeteef"?
- Fugitive.

835
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,189
F-U...

836
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:22,350
Up yours, too, froggy.

837
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:23,799
Oh, fugitive.

838
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,313
- Name?
- Frederic.

839
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,397
Strange name for a girl.

840
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:28,754
My name is Stanley.

841
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:31,559
- Still a strange name for a girl.
- Mabel Stanley.

842
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,438
Tell me, Mabel...

843
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,356
about these pirates.

844
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,474
Parrots?

845
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:49,116
The pirates. They're on their way
to the castle, led by the Pirate King.

846
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,760
This Pirate King, does he have a horse?

847
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:54,189
A nurse? Yeah, Ruth.

848
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:57,073
I don't want to know its name.
How fast does it run?

849
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,071
You want to know how fast a nurse runs?

850
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:02,357
An horse.
What do you think this is, a parrot?

851
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,432
- Parrot?
- A parrot!

852
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:09,320
"Polly wants a cracker!" Stupid girl.

853
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,510
These other pirates, their names.

854
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:15,833
Long John Silver, with the wooden leg.
He wears a parrot on his shoulder.

855
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,718
Then there's Ruth, she's a horse,
I mean, a nurse.

856
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,269
Why don't you just follow me to the fort?

857
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:23,749
Fort?

858
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:36,477
Pick up those hoofprints as evidence.

859
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:49,712
Back to the castle!

860
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,916
These pirates won't know what hit them!

861
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,231
We'll put an end to their terror,
butchery, arson, and rape!

862
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:05,433
Not to mention robbery, flogging,
kidnapping, and cop killing!

863
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,995
Though to us it's evident

864
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,670
These intentions are well meant

865
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,510
Such expressions don't appear

866
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,236
Calculated men to cheer

867
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:35,071
Who are going to meet their fate

868
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,030
In a highly nervous state

869
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:44,879
Still to us it's evident
These intentions are well meant

870
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:48,396
These intentions are well meant

871
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:52,189
Tarantara! Tarantara!

872
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:30,429
Lads!

873
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,270
We are the pirates

874
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:47,110
We are the pirates

875
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,395
Out upon the ocean waves

876
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,869
we instill fear and loathing

877
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:56,474
Loathing, we are very, very loathed

878
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,949
Marauders with shiny swords

879
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,793
and very fancy clothing

880
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,838
Clothing, we are very well clothed

881
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:08,913
Global supremacy is what we gun for

882
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:12,277
We raise our flag
and watch the cowards run

883
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,791
We are the pirates

884
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,996
Rulers of the high seas

885
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:21,073
We can be irate
Sometimes very nasty

886
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:24,795
We wheel, we deal
We steal their thunder

887
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:28,716
We shoot, we loot
We put 'em under

888
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,951
We are the pirates

889
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:33,031
Shoot, loot, plunder

890
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:37,033
We can be irate
shoot, loot asunder

891
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:40,430
The pirates, we're the pirates

892
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,151
Put your backs to it, lads.

893
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:47,268
One...

894
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,430
No, let's try the pyramid.

895
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:10,355
Nothing we like better
Than a dreadful brawl

896
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:14,278
Locked in battle
See our victims fall

897
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:17,079
Oh, we are the pirates

898
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,151
Batten down the hatches

899
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:21,037
We can be irate

900
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,872
Aye, eye patches

901
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,916
The pirates

902
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:27,071
The pirates

903
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:30,232
We are the pirates

904
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,834
Now I suppose
we have to take the other one back.

905
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:36,273
Oh, shit!

906
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:55,431
Two, three!

907
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,671
Avon calling.

908
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:55,474
With cat-like tread
Upon our prey we steal

909
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:59,559
In silence dread
Our cautious way we feel

910
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:03,555
No sound at all!
We never speak a word

911
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:07,553
A fly's foot-fall
Would be distinctly heard

912
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:10,438
Tarantara, tarantara

913
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:15,591
So stealthily the pirate creeps
While all the household soundly sleeps

914
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:23,469
Come, friends who plough the sea

915
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:27,879
Steady navigation, shirking devastation

916
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:31,316
Let's vary piracy

917
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:34,838
With a little lechery!

918
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:39,999
Come, friends who plough the sea

919
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:43,954
Steady navigation, shirking devastation

920
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:47,430
Let's vary piracy

921
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,717
With a little lechery!

922
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,634
Mabel! Oh, I missed you!

923
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,635
That's nice. How have you been, Fred?

924
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:10,315
How have I been?
Come out and let me hold you.

925
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:12,794
At least a kiss.

926
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:15,792
What is this?

927
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:18,838
We're enemies now.
I thought you'd remember.

928
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:22,151
- You don't think I want it this way?
- It's up to you.

929
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:23,349
Okay.

930
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:27,237
If that's the way you want it.
Good-bye, Mabe.

931
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:28,868
Good-bye.

932
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:38,514
Damn you!

933
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:42,157
I love you. I'll always love you,
come what may.

934
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:45,152
We'll all be murdered in our beds,
"come what may."

935
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:47,629
Well, run, for God's sake. Run.

936
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:49,039
Death before dishonor!

937
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:52,157
Besides, running in one of these things
is a real bitch.

938
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:53,668
Frederic!

939
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,159
Duty calls.

940
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:57,909
Enemies?

941
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:00,269
Enemies.

942
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:11,228
Frederic!

943
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:17,034
Good-bye. Coming!

944
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:24,919
Come, friends who plough the sea

945
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,152
Steady navigation, shirking devastation

946
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:34,068
Let's vary piracy

947
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:44,275
With a little lechery

948
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,154
Seize him!

949
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:01,640
Not him, you idiots! Him!

950
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:17,113
Come, lads, the ladies are waiting.

951
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:21,912
Get off!

952
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,233
Frederic, help us!

953
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:33,152
Frederic, please.

954
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:43,871
Will no one save us?

955
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:56,959
Good evening, all.

956
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:04,631
Hello, hello... Hello.

957
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:07,312
What's going on here, then?

958
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:11,514
"It is my duty to warn you that
anything you say may be taken down..."

959
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:12,919
Nick off!

960
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:38,479
Come on!

961
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:50,594
Come on, girls, hurry. This way. Hurry!

962
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:57,110
- Mabel, hide!
- No, you look after them.

963
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:58,599
Mabel, no!

964
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:00,354
It's suicide!

965
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:15,918
Sam, stop fooling around.

966
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,399
Get off me.

967
01:20:58,120 --> 01:20:59,599
Help!

968
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:02,513
Watch out, John!

969
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:11,993
Look out, John!

970
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,514
I want it ended right now, John.

971
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:31,390
"You have the right to remain silent..."

972
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:38,635
Oh, no, not a pie fight.

973
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,199
Not anchovy!

974
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:43,395
Pizza.

975
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:02,158
You got all the anchovies.

976
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:19,316
Can I believe what I am seeing

977
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:22,119
What I am feeling

978
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:26,798
Something so rare
Watching her there

979
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,230
She makes my heart stall

980
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:35,994
War is hell.

981
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:52,959
Charge!

982
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:55,630
Get out of my gymnasium, all of you!

983
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,758
Charge! What's going on here?

984
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:04,716
You there, knock it off!

985
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:10,476
- No, put him down.
- I'll deal with this.

986
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:13,233
Enough! Enough!

987
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,672
We are all orphans.

988
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,512
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

989
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:21,439
You have taken advantage
of my better nature...

990
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:23,677
my compassion for humanity...

991
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,837
my gentle kindness to all creatures
great and small.

992
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:28,354
Rip their lungs out!

993
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:30,954
Feed them to the sharks,
beginning with her!

994
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:34,112
Wait a minute!

995
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:36,032
This is my dream.

996
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:39,518
I want a happy ending.

997
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:41,392
I want a happy ending!

998
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:44,633
A happy ending?

999
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:47,996
- A full pardon for Frederic.
- No.

1000
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:50,589
He's done nothing to be pardoned for.

1001
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:54,309
At every turn of fate and fortune,
he has simply done his duty.

1002
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:56,272
Kneel, Frederic.

1003
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:00,234
Arise, Sir Frederic.

1004
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:03,233
I reward you
with the fairest prize at my command.

1005
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:05,595
That is, if she's still at my command.

1006
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:08,189
My youngest daughter, Mabel.

1007
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:17,669
The custom! You've got to do something,
I can't get married till they are!

1008
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:19,398
We are helpless.

1009
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,672
It's your dream.

1010
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:36,752
I found your glasses.

1011
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:49,676
You and you. And, you and you.

1012
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:53,590
And you and you.

1013
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,197
And you, and up there, you.

1014
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:58,396
You and you.

1015
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:04,193
And you and you.

1016
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:06,788
You're a problem.

1017
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:09,030
That was no dream I had last night.

1018
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:13,077
I loved a woman.
I want that woman for my wife.

1019
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:14,719
I accept.

1020
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,432
But that was you last...

1021
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,671
In that case, lads...

1022
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,239
I accept.

1023
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,392
But I thought you...

1024
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:34,874
You and he...

1025
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:36,474
I don't get it.

1026
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,234
You will.

1027
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:22,911
No more sad times

1028
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,197
mad, or bad times

1029
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:31,589
No more minor keys

1030
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:36,957
Life's for living

1031
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:40,956
sharing, giving

1032
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:46,154
Life's for you and me

1033
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:51,589
When the going's rough
and you've had enough

1034
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:55,270
Leave your troubles and your woe

1035
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:59,029
Turn the other cheek and forget your grief

1036
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:02,795
Make a friend out of your foe

1037
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:08,679
Give me a happy ending

1038
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:11,517
every time

1039
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,910
We'll kiss and make up

1040
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:18,993
That's a very peaceful sign

1041
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:23,518
Give me a happy ending

1042
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:26,231
every time

1043
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,636
Don't be unhappy

1044
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:33,918
everything will work out fine

1045
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:37,511
No more fighting

1046
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,310
scratching, biting

1047
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:46,754
No more police and thieves

1048
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:52,396
All is sweetness

1049
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:55,831
light, and neatness

1050
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:57,634
Yes, sir.

1051
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:59,672
No, thanks.

1052
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,478
Please.

1053
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:06,954
When you've had
your fill of life's ugly pills

1054
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:09,799
The sadness and the pain

1055
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:14,229
Take the box of pills and attendant ills

1056
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:17,917
Flush them down the drain

1057
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:23,599
Give me a happy ending

1058
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:26,358
every time

1059
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,956
We'll kiss and make up

1060
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:34,556
That's a very peaceful sign

1061
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:38,040
Give me a happy ending

1062
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:41,191
every time

1063
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,550
Don't be unhappy

1064
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:49,395
everything will work out fine

1065
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:51,994
Everything will work out fine

1066
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:54,799
Give me a happy ending

1067
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,591
every time

1068
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,996
We'll kiss and make up

1069
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:05,551
That's a very peaceful sign

1070
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:32,511
Your name wouldn't by any chance
be Frederic, would it?

1071
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:38,789
No.

1072
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:43,316
I don't suppose you came looking for me
out of a sense of duty?

1073
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,274
Not exactly.

1074
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:57,233
214, take one!

1075
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:00,276
Someone better take my gum.

1076
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:05,994
I just want to say that
it's not all sunglasses and autographs.

1077
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:36,796
ENGLISH SDH
