1
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,615
The ambience is romantic.

2
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,090
Let's fall in love.

3
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:02,657
Come, come, come.

4
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,196
Come, beloved.

5
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,999
The ambience is romantic.

6
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,195
Let's fall in love.

7
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:12,997
Come, come, come.

8
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,405
Come, beloved.

9
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:24,441
What else is there in this heart?

10
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:43,968
When you were born...
you didn't cry...

11
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,402
...even when the nurse hit you.

12
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,531
I should have understood then only.

13
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,474
You are not those who cry but
those who make others cry.

14
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:52,977
Pops, please. Chill!

15
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,344
I don't know about that, son.

16
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:59,146
But since the time you have been
rusticated from three colleges...

17
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,979
...I have started taking BP pills.

18
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,987
How you are still in BSS college
for past 2 months...

19
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:07,584
...without creating any problem...
God only knows.

20
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:12,060
Actually you are right, pops. It's
very bad for my reputation.

21
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,066
- What!
- I will have to do something.

22
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,364
Listen to me carefully, Raju!

23
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:20,004
If you did mess up things
in this college then from...

24
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,667
...3 rooms in the house, one
room will be evacuated.

25
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,108
Pops, please. Where will
you go at this age?

26
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:26,304
- What?
- What?

27
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,277
Bad! Very bad!

28
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,543
Now he has got a new craze
after going to the college.

29
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,144
Under the pretext of studying,
he fights in college...

30
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,278
...he abuses and he threatens people.

31
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:39,553
This is Raju Malhotra. He
is a stigma. A stigma!

32
00:02:59,311 --> 00:03:02,007
Now stop it! Enough of studying.

33
00:03:02,314 --> 00:03:05,408
I forgot to add Boost in your milk.

34
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,243
No problem, mummy.

35
00:03:07,486 --> 00:03:10,046
I had done pranayam taught
by Ramdev Baba.

36
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,924
Son, when you were born
I thought that...

37
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:18,157
...my son will grow up
to be a stud like me.

38
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,131
But you are only concerned
about studies.

39
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,234
You neither have any friend
nor any social group.

40
00:03:24,303 --> 00:03:25,861
No PR, no marketing.

41
00:03:25,938 --> 00:03:28,202
You only work on the computer.

42
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:30,105
After that you will be gone.

43
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:33,435
Others' fathers say that my son
will achieve something in life.

44
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:37,176
My son will make his parents proud.

45
00:03:37,516 --> 00:03:39,950
But papa, to which destination
you want me...

46
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,214
Son, my destination
is, I want that...

47
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:45,189
...you should not be Koi
Mil Gaya's Hrithik.

48
00:03:45,424 --> 00:03:46,891
Son, be like Hrithik
of Krish movie.

49
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,223
Socialize like me.
And make me proud.

50
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:52,025
Why are you teaching wrong
things to my son?

51
00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:53,155
What is in this?

52
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:54,893
He wants me to be like him.

53
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,059
But I don't want to be
a businessman like him.

54
00:03:57,436 --> 00:04:00,303
I want to be an IAS officer
and serve the country.

55
00:04:00,372 --> 00:04:04,308
After becoming IAS officer
will you accept bribe?

56
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,238
What kind of a papa are you?

57
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:07,904
If you had your way, you
would have written...

58
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,277
...on my hand that my
father is a thief!

59
00:04:09,348 --> 00:04:10,906
What did you say? What did you say?

60
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:16,081
Son... I don't tell you
to be a bad boy.

61
00:04:16,355 --> 00:04:19,449
But you only have to handle
your papa's business.

62
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:20,583
That is what I am explaining to him!

63
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:23,520
What is his business? To
drink and serve others.

64
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:26,056
Please! Let me live my
life the way I want!

65
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:27,393
I am Rajan!

66
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:29,866
I am not going to change myself!
I am what I am!

67
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:30,993
Son...

68
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,128
Rajan!

69
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:36,036
- Down with BSS!
- Down with Debo Chaterjee!

70
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:38,872
- Down with BSS!
- Down with Debo Chaterjee!

71
00:04:38,944 --> 00:04:40,241
Down with BSS!

72
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:42,069
What is a child's right?

73
00:04:42,948 --> 00:04:44,347
That he gets Farex twice in a day.

74
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:47,874
A new nappy after every 3 hours.
And a new toy after every 2 days.

75
00:04:47,953 --> 00:04:50,888
We used to get these rights
when we were small.

76
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:52,890
But since the time we have
joined this college...

77
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,186
...all these rights have
been snatched from us!

78
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:59,089
Commotion? Sir!

79
00:04:59,164 --> 00:05:01,894
Now there is bound to be
commotion in college...

80
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:04,401
...and not in Nursery or KG.

81
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,995
If you can't handle the
college students...

82
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:09,473
...then give your resignation
immediately.

83
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,338
No, sir! There is no problem, sir!

84
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,940
Sir, everything is under the table.

85
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,914
I mean everything is under control.

86
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:19,381
Here it's very peaceful.

87
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:21,919
It's the right of every young
girl to wear short skirt...

88
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:25,445
...to feel cool in the sizzling heat.

89
00:05:25,524 --> 00:05:28,084
And it's the right of
every young guy...

90
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,060
...to see girls in short skirts.

91
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:34,858
I say... you all have
to decide whether...

92
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,869
...you want to give the exams or not!

93
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,473
You are bad.

94
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,917
You are bad.

95
00:05:58,157 --> 00:05:59,886
You are good.

96
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,292
You are good.

97
00:06:11,236 --> 00:06:14,034
Pretty, pretty, pretty babe!

98
00:06:14,106 --> 00:06:16,904
Wants to know...

99
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,145
You are bad.

100
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:28,345
You are bad.

101
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,888
You are a bad, bad boy.

102
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,318
You are bad.

103
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,483
You are bad.

104
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,857
You are a bad, bad boy.

105
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:38,359
You are good. You are good.

106
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,921
You are a good, good boy.

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,058
You are good.

108
00:06:42,134 --> 00:06:43,431
You are good.

109
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:45,970
You are a good, good boy.

110
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,871
My beloved's hug.

111
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,068
My love's hug.

112
00:06:51,143 --> 00:06:53,509
My beloved's hug.

113
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,047
My love's hug.

114
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,982
It gives me solace.

115
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,349
It takes me to heaven.

116
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,217
I am bad. I am bad.

117
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:05,950
I am a bad, bad boy.

118
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,323
You are bad. You are bad.

119
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:11,022
You are a bad, bad boy.

120
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:13,587
My beloved's hug.

121
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:16,060
My love's hug.

122
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:18,968
It gives me solace.

123
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,972
It takes me to heaven.

124
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,302
I am bad.

125
00:07:22,374 --> 00:07:23,500
I am bad.

126
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:25,873
I am a bad, bad boy.

127
00:07:25,944 --> 00:07:27,172
You are bad.

128
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,338
You are bad.

129
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,939
You are a bad, bad boy.

130
00:07:51,403 --> 00:07:53,462
My heart, heart, heart.

131
00:07:53,872 --> 00:07:56,067
My heart is crazy.

132
00:07:56,208 --> 00:08:01,111
It loves you all the time.

133
00:08:01,313 --> 00:08:03,941
You are the desire of my breath.

134
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,348
You are my dream.

135
00:08:06,585 --> 00:08:11,318
My each heartbeat
has accepted you.

136
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,956
The slight heat of chill.

137
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:16,221
The charm of your beauty.

138
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:19,059
It gives me solace.

139
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:20,996
It takes me to heaven.

140
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:22,260
I am bad.

141
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:23,494
I am bad.

142
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,003
I am a bad, bad boy.

143
00:08:26,071 --> 00:08:27,197
You are bad.

144
00:08:27,272 --> 00:08:28,500
You are bad.

145
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,139
You are a bad, bad boy.

146
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,303
Go, go, go.

147
00:08:33,378 --> 00:08:36,006
Beloved.

148
00:08:36,348 --> 00:08:41,183
You don't know what
my desires are.

149
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:44,012
I don't like anything without you.

150
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,319
Without you, without you.

151
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:48,951
Without you, nothing seems lively.

152
00:08:49,027 --> 00:08:51,222
Without you, without you.

153
00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:53,924
This grace of your saunter.

154
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:56,297
The fragrance of your cheeks.

155
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:59,030
It gives me solace.

156
00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:01,072
It takes me to heaven.

157
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,334
I am bad.

158
00:09:02,407 --> 00:09:03,874
I am bad.

159
00:09:03,942 --> 00:09:06,103
I am a bad, bad boy.

160
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,270
You are bad.

161
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:08,540
You are bad.

162
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,111
You are a bad, bad boy.

163
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:13,582
You are bad. You are bad.

164
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,184
You are a bad, bad boy.

165
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,883
You are good. You are good.

166
00:09:18,957 --> 00:09:21,391
You are a good, good boy.

167
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,894
You are bad. You are bad.

168
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:26,294
You are a bad, bad boy.

169
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,525
You are bad.

170
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:28,998
You are bad.

171
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:31,467
You are a bad, bad boy.

172
00:09:32,437 --> 00:09:33,597
Hey!

173
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:58,160
- That's okay. Now you can leave.
- Okay, sir.

174
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,169
He is Awasthi. What
is he doing here?

175
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:11,939
Maybe we need Awasthi to reform
the state of this college.

176
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:23,613
I am your new Principal.
Diwan Chand Awasthi.

177
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:26,891
There will be a meeting
tomorrow evening...

178
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,483
...at 4 in the college hall.

179
00:10:30,128 --> 00:10:33,359
Now I want the introductions
to be done properly.

180
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:39,030
Yours... mine... ours.

181
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:59,415
In life everybody has
a responsibility.

182
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:03,419
You all and I too have
a responsibility.

183
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:08,933
Your responsibility is to study
and be a better human being.

184
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:13,504
And my responsibility is to make
you all a better human being.

185
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:17,940
You all will be sad to know...
I have a bad habit...

186
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,411
...of fulfilling my responsibility.

187
00:11:27,085 --> 00:11:29,144
So... whether you all want or not...

188
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:32,349
...you all will have to fulfill
your responsibility from today.

189
00:11:32,424 --> 00:11:35,018
Otherwise the consequence
will be very bad.

190
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,991
In this college...

191
00:11:43,101 --> 00:11:44,193
Excuse me.

192
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:48,933
I think somebody has messaged
you a funny joke.

193
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:50,371
Right?

194
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,438
Come and show it to us on the
stage. We all will laugh.

195
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,207
Come on the stage.

196
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,906
Just come on the stage.

197
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:14,555
This principal is a big bore.
P for 'Pakau' (Bore). 'Pakau'!

198
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:19,161
Mr. Dinesh's point of view about
me is very interesting!

199
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,372
Mr. Dinesh! Mr. Long Hair Wonder!

200
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,941
Please come on the stage.
And accompany me.

201
00:12:26,044 --> 00:12:27,341
Please come on the stage.

202
00:12:30,148 --> 00:12:31,206
Hi.

203
00:12:32,884 --> 00:12:36,513
You think that I am a big bore.
P for 'Pakau' (Bore).

204
00:12:38,523 --> 00:12:40,423
You think that I relate to the
alphabet P.

205
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:42,585
I will tell you about myself.

206
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,360
I relate to the alphabet E.

207
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,194
Now I will give you
both E certificates.

208
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,434
You are expelled.

209
00:13:02,914 --> 00:13:04,006
Destruction.

210
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,577
He expelled Dinesh from the college.

211
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,409
This Principal won't stay
in this college for long.

212
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,454
He expelled MLA's son.

213
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,958
What does he think
of himself? Oh no!

214
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:20,322
Hello!

215
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,457
Papa!

216
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,058
Papa!

217
00:13:26,204 --> 00:13:28,263
Papa, this is Rashmi speaking.

218
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,036
Mr. Awasthi, this
is Rashmi speaking.

219
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:34,543
That's correct. Tell me, Rashmi.

220
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,008
Sorry, sir. I forgot that
I can't call you papa.

221
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:42,386
From today I will address you
only as sir or Mr. Awasthi.

222
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,890
You see, this agreement between
father and daughter...

223
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:47,891
...is because I don't know
the college students...

224
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:50,427
...to find out that you are my
daughter and exploit you.

225
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:54,226
- You know that.
- I know, papa. Sorry! Sir!

226
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:55,891
But sir... your arrival
in the college has...

227
00:13:55,967 --> 00:13:59,494
...for a moment put the
bad boys into trouble.

228
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:04,001
It will happen more often. See
what happens in the future.

229
00:14:04,075 --> 00:14:07,169
Sir, you will get a
gold medal in acting.

230
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:10,442
I have already won that a long
time ago in this college.

231
00:14:11,082 --> 00:14:12,549
Tell me, dear. What is going on?

232
00:14:12,617 --> 00:14:14,915
Look... now you addressed me as dear.

233
00:14:14,986 --> 00:14:18,149
I am your student living
in the hostel.

234
00:14:18,223 --> 00:14:19,281
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

235
00:14:19,357 --> 00:14:22,554
At times I have some problem
in playing this double role.

236
00:14:22,627 --> 00:14:26,324
That's it. Okay, dear.
Bye. Sorry. Bye.

237
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:27,456
Bye.

238
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,870
Yesterday evening on
the college stage...

239
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,432
...you had played the role
of a plastic principal.

240
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:41,345
That was good! Good!

241
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:44,246
But... you have to maintain that.

242
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,510
Here guys are very smart!

243
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:52,990
And you have to be smarter
than them. Understand.

244
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,185
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!
I have understood!

245
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:04,527
'What a college! What existence!
What fun!'

246
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:10,032
'There was only one hero. Me.
Diwan Chand Awasthi.'

247
00:15:17,315 --> 00:15:21,911
'Sir, I could have never thought,
the college where I studied...

248
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:26,185
...under your guidance... I've become
the principal of that college.'

249
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:30,852
'Sir... now students don't
need idol of conduct Ram...

250
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:35,263
...they need Krishna
as per today's time.'

251
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,039
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

252
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,304
Oh God! Run!

253
00:15:55,053 --> 00:15:57,021
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yeah.

254
00:15:57,322 --> 00:16:00,348
- Sir, we want to leave this college.
- Yes, sir.

255
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:01,550
What!

256
00:16:01,893 --> 00:16:03,360
Please don't misunderstand us, sir.

257
00:16:03,895 --> 00:16:06,125
But our family has great
expectations from us.

258
00:16:06,197 --> 00:16:08,290
And we have always been
good students. But...

259
00:16:08,366 --> 00:16:10,891
But the current college ambience...

260
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:12,027
...you can see it for yourself.

261
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:17,040
We can't study in this state.
So we... sorry, sir.

262
00:16:27,352 --> 00:16:30,549
'Mr. Awasthi, the exam is not easy.'

263
00:16:30,855 --> 00:16:32,914
'You will have to tolerate
many things.'

264
00:16:35,193 --> 00:16:37,525
Principal Awasthi!

265
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,359
Yes, man!

266
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,904
Your responsibility is to study.

267
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:49,196
My responsibility is to educate you.

268
00:16:49,474 --> 00:16:53,570
E for education. A for arrest.
Dinesh was right.

269
00:16:53,878 --> 00:16:56,073
This new Principal is
P for 'Pakau' (A bore).

270
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,382
Hit! Hit!

271
00:17:02,887 --> 00:17:04,081
Why did you stop?

272
00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:05,884
What's your problem?

273
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:10,159
The face on which you are throwing
the darts, he is your guru.

274
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:17,163
There was Eklavya. For his guru,
he cut his thumb. And you!

275
00:17:19,437 --> 00:17:20,995
What's the use of cutting the thumb?

276
00:17:21,272 --> 00:17:23,069
What will we get in return? Nothing.

277
00:17:23,908 --> 00:17:25,205
What are you trying to say?

278
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,172
For example look at our exams.

279
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:28,844
In our country intelligence
is measured...

280
00:17:28,913 --> 00:17:32,110
...only by the marks that
we score in the exams.

281
00:17:32,183 --> 00:17:36,017
And did you know? Einstein whom
people call as a genius...

282
00:17:36,087 --> 00:17:39,853
...he was stupid in school.

283
00:17:40,191 --> 00:17:43,319
You think that you can change the
system by behaving like this.

284
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,853
Yes. Uncle Einstein's theory...
every action has...

285
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:51,425
...an equal and opposite...
attraction.

286
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:56,534
Firstly it's Newton. And secondly,
not attraction.

287
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,877
Not now. But it will happen someday.

288
00:18:02,947 --> 00:18:05,108
It will never happen.
Do you know why?

289
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,884
Because Newton's actual theory is...

290
00:18:07,952 --> 00:18:11,479
...for every action there is an
equal and opposite reaction.

291
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:24,925
- Come quickly.
- What happened?

292
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:26,197
The guy's family has
come to see ma'am.

293
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,431
- Oh no!
- The alliance is almost fixed.

294
00:18:27,505 --> 00:18:29,097
- Oh no!
- Come quickly! - I forgot!

295
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,099
Take it.

296
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,007
Sorry, guys! I am very
sorry. I am late.

297
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,376
There was so much traffic
on the road.

298
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,074
My bike too broke down. But...

299
00:18:37,148 --> 00:18:39,844
- You!
- Oh no!

300
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:43,944
I think you know my son Raju.

301
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:47,856
Yes! And if I had known that this
goon is Kavita's brother...

302
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:50,053
...I would have never come here.

303
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:51,356
What has he done?

304
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:53,420
What has he done? Look at this!

305
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:58,024
He was in a stupor in the disco.
And he misbehaved with my sister.

306
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,867
When I tried to stop him...
he smashed...

307
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:02,873
...the beer bottle on my head.

308
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:05,034
You see... that day I was too drunk.

309
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,044
And there was some misunderstanding.

310
00:19:07,879 --> 00:19:08,971
It's okay. It's my mistake.

311
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:10,878
I have done a mistake
by coming here.

312
00:19:11,015 --> 00:19:13,882
The girl whose brother misbehaved
with my sister...

313
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:16,978
...and who hit me... I should
make her my wife...

314
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:18,954
...you must be crazy, man.

315
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:22,890
Hey! You can say anything about me.

316
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:24,891
But if you said anything
about my sister then...

317
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:27,295
...I will break the coconut
on your head.

318
00:19:27,365 --> 00:19:30,300
- You will hit me? Did you see this papa?
- Mama!

319
00:19:30,368 --> 00:19:32,893
- Let's leave immediately.
- Okay.
- Look!

320
00:19:33,304 --> 00:19:35,932
Don't reject the alliance.

321
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:39,439
I know my son has made a mistake.

322
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:43,948
- I apologize for that. Please. Please don't go!
- Listen!

323
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:49,377
I am sorry.

324
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:52,446
You are sorry? You know
what is your problem?

325
00:19:52,924 --> 00:19:54,915
You are always sorry, brother.

326
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:57,928
And you know what...
today I am sorry.

327
00:19:58,263 --> 00:19:59,924
Because I am your sister.

328
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:13,544
- Dad, I am...
- Congrats, son.

329
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:17,114
I am really proud
that you are a bad boy.

330
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,610
How can he do this?

331
00:20:24,088 --> 00:20:26,921
To rusticate the student
for a trivial matter.

332
00:20:27,091 --> 00:20:29,889
I don't agree with this.

333
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,892
After all students need freedom.

334
00:20:32,964 --> 00:20:36,491
Excuse me, ma'am. What is
freedom according to you?

335
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:42,271
Freedom means... living
life to the fullest.

336
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,000
Oh God!

337
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:50,414
Ma'am! Explain it in detail.

338
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:54,982
You see... we like your
this kind of freedom.

339
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:56,914
Raju!

340
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:01,090
You all... are Hanuman's apes.

341
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:05,921
Ma'am, don't you think... freedom
that is careless...

342
00:21:05,997 --> 00:21:07,589
...it is not freedom but destruction.

343
00:21:07,932 --> 00:21:09,058
Excuse me!

344
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,431
Every person has a different
point of view.

345
00:21:12,937 --> 00:21:15,929
For example according to me if
students gets the permission...

346
00:21:16,007 --> 00:21:18,601
...to bunk the lecture...
then that is freedom.

347
00:21:18,676 --> 00:21:20,405
- Am I right, guys?
- Yeah!

348
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,445
What is freedom according
to you all?

349
00:21:23,514 --> 00:21:25,880
Chikoo gets to marry Awasthi.

350
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,076
That is called freedom.

351
00:21:27,151 --> 00:21:28,880
When girls are always
free with guys...

352
00:21:28,953 --> 00:21:31,114
...that is freedom, man!

353
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:33,885
When you get clothes at 100%
discount in shopping mall...

354
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,016
...that is freedom.

355
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:37,891
The day every youth of this
country has a job...

356
00:21:37,962 --> 00:21:39,020
...that is freedom.

357
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:42,066
If my boyfriend allows me to have
affairs with other guys...

358
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:43,498
...that is called freedom.

359
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:46,162
Isn't 'Azadi' (freedom) Manoj
Kumar's movie's title?

360
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:52,100
When a boring lecture ends...
that is freedom.

361
00:21:52,176 --> 00:21:54,235
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

362
00:22:00,051 --> 00:22:01,313
Good afternoon, sir.

363
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:18,193
'Sir, we want to leave
this college.'

364
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:20,930
'Our family has great
expectations from us.'

365
00:22:21,005 --> 00:22:22,939
'And we have always been
good students. But...'

366
00:22:23,007 --> 00:22:24,941
'But the current college ambience...

367
00:22:26,277 --> 00:22:28,074
'We can't study in this state.'

368
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:35,182
Friends. We are leaving the college.

369
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:38,450
- Take care, buddy.
- We will meet again.
- Bye.

370
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,888
Come.

371
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:42,086
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, sir.

372
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:46,157
You must have heard students
telling the principal...

373
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,959
...sir, give me one more chance.

374
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,967
But what if principal
tells the student...

375
00:22:52,103 --> 00:22:53,900
...give me one more chance?

376
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,464
Sir, you are embarrassing us.

377
00:22:58,142 --> 00:22:59,234
We love you, sir.

378
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:02,973
Look, if you love me... you should
love the college also.

379
00:23:04,415 --> 00:23:07,407
So I reject your application for
leaving the college. Okay.

380
00:23:08,219 --> 00:23:09,550
- Go and attend the classes.
- Okay, sir.
- Yes, sir.

381
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,144
- Thank you, sir.
- Okay.

382
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:15,926
You all must be thinking
why I have called...

383
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:18,485
...you all here suddenly.

384
00:23:19,163 --> 00:23:22,929
I will divide my students
into 3 categories.

385
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:26,400
Those below 50% in C section.

386
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:29,873
Between 50%-70% in B section.

387
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:33,136
And above 70% in A section.

388
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:35,475
What? Class A, B and C!

389
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,571
Do we have to learn
A, B and C again!

390
00:23:37,915 --> 00:23:42,409
The bright students of A section...
we just have to guide them.

391
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:44,352
I think it's a fantastic idea!

392
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:49,219
We have to motivate B section
students to fare better.

393
00:23:49,527 --> 00:23:51,461
I want to be with bad boys!

394
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:56,057
And teach discipline to study
to section C students.

395
00:23:59,537 --> 00:24:01,596
So start dividing the
students into sections.

396
00:24:01,906 --> 00:24:03,066
I think it's a great idea!

397
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:04,574
Is this a college or Howrah train?

398
00:24:04,642 --> 00:24:08,009
Bogie first class, bogie second
class. It's a bad idea.

399
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,239
Yes!

400
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:13,945
- They may put us into any sections.
- Great! Great! It's great!

401
00:24:14,018 --> 00:24:17,476
- An amazing thing has happened.
- What happened?

402
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:22,288
Our new principal has divided
the animals from humans.

403
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,624
You have gone mad!

404
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:26,863
Keep quiet, 50% students!

405
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:29,229
During Diwali, you gave me stale
food instead of sweets!

406
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,929
Now under section C you will be
punished in the scorching heat!

407
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:37,236
And I will mock your
state and enjoy!

408
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:39,303
You!

409
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:42,312
- Hail principal! Hail principal!
- Now understand.

410
00:24:43,314 --> 00:24:46,078
Freedom is gone. And destruction
has started.

411
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,981
Today he rusticated Dinesh.

412
00:24:48,052 --> 00:24:49,519
Tomorrow he can do anything.

413
00:24:49,587 --> 00:24:52,886
- Why didn't he think before?
I wonder. I am very happy.
- Me too.

414
00:24:52,957 --> 00:24:54,288
Everything has changed in 2 days.

415
00:24:54,358 --> 00:24:56,553
Hey! How did you say that?

416
00:24:56,894 --> 00:24:59,954
- With my mouth.
- Mouth!

417
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:04,026
Nowadays you have started
talking a lot.

418
00:25:04,168 --> 00:25:07,604
- What is going on?
- Nothing, sir.

419
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:11,497
We all are friends. We were having
some fun. So you know...

420
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:13,009
Nothing to worry.

421
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:15,408
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

422
00:25:22,453 --> 00:25:23,511
Yes.

423
00:25:25,456 --> 00:25:29,187
Yes, yes. Vinay.

424
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:33,922
Yo!

425
00:25:33,998 --> 00:25:36,523
They come to quarrel, not to study.

426
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:38,927
You got scared?

427
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:42,573
I am scared of myself. I hate lies.

428
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,874
If principal had found
out about them...

429
00:25:44,942 --> 00:25:46,876
...they would have been rusticated.

430
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:48,908
I didn't want that to happen.

431
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,149
I am very happy.

432
00:25:57,221 --> 00:25:58,950
- Yeah. It's a cool idea!
- Actually!

433
00:25:59,023 --> 00:26:01,992
- At least those students will feel relaxed.
- I know.

434
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:04,425
Those who come to study in the
college and not to kill time.

435
00:26:04,495 --> 00:26:05,553
- I swear.
- Exactly.

436
00:26:08,065 --> 00:26:09,896
I think it's a very stupid idea!

437
00:26:10,034 --> 00:26:13,026
What you think... who
has asked you that?

438
00:26:13,137 --> 00:26:15,037
Life is like 'Bhel Puri'
(a kind of snacks).

439
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,499
Like what? 'Bhel Puri'.

440
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:22,274
It has sweet things like me. And
some spicy things like you.

441
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:28,011
Now if both are separated, life
becomes dull. Like Awasthi.

442
00:26:28,085 --> 00:26:32,886
Listen, if you think we can be
together, then you are mistaken.

443
00:26:32,957 --> 00:26:34,424
It's impossible!

444
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:38,428
Impossible! If you separate
impossible... what do you get?

445
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:40,861
I am possible.

446
00:26:41,165 --> 00:26:45,534
By the way I like difficulties
and spicy things.

447
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:50,373
Really? Well then... try it.
But you will lose.

448
00:26:50,441 --> 00:26:52,466
Because I am impossible!

449
00:26:57,548 --> 00:26:59,106
Ms. Difficult!

450
00:27:01,185 --> 00:27:02,880
Did you call me, ma'am?

451
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:07,550
- Yes, Bakeda. Listen to me carefully.
- Okay, ma'am. Go on.

452
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:11,891
Look, I was saying that section
A, B and C's student...

453
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,123
Will go to watch a movie.

454
00:27:13,197 --> 00:27:16,257
When did I say that? Don't
try to act smart!

455
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:21,067
- I said to stick their photo on the ID card.
- Okay.

456
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:25,867
List A has toppers. Average
in B. And dull students in C.

457
00:27:26,043 --> 00:27:29,501
Put it up on the notice
board tomorrow morning.

458
00:27:31,215 --> 00:27:32,477
It will be done, ma'am.

459
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:38,044
Confusion, ma'am! Confusion!

460
00:27:38,122 --> 00:27:40,886
Here R. Malhotra. And
there R. Malhotra.

461
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,260
I will solve the confusion.

462
00:27:59,143 --> 00:28:02,408
Malhotra and Malhotra!

463
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,926
Congrats. You are in class A.

464
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:19,427
- Are you joking?
- You are there, buddy!

465
00:28:23,901 --> 00:28:24,890
What...

466
00:28:37,181 --> 00:28:38,239
Class A!

467
00:28:40,117 --> 00:28:41,846
Hey guys, do you see my name?

468
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,386
- Excuse me!
- Hurry up!

469
00:28:43,454 --> 00:28:46,912
- One second!
- Let him see! Let him see!
- Oh no!

470
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:53,259
Where is my name, man?
I don't see my name!

471
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:54,457
How come my name is
not in section A?

472
00:28:55,366 --> 00:29:00,861
Because baby... your name...
from top to bottom...

473
00:29:00,938 --> 00:29:06,171
...is above my name.

474
00:29:28,966 --> 00:29:30,456
Good morning, sir.

475
00:29:31,902 --> 00:29:33,369
Sir, my name is Rajan Malhotra.

476
00:29:33,904 --> 00:29:35,371
I have scored 92%.

477
00:29:35,906 --> 00:29:37,430
I hope you understand, sir.

478
00:29:37,975 --> 00:29:39,909
This is some other R.
Malhotra on whose ID...

479
00:29:39,977 --> 00:29:41,239
...my photo has been affixed.

480
00:29:41,612 --> 00:29:43,978
Sir, please just look
into the matter.

481
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:45,443
There has been a terrible mistake.

482
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:48,449
Nab that fraud and give
him severe punishment.

483
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:50,077
Hand him over to the police.

484
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:56,525
Yes, brother. What has happened
with you, it is bad!

485
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:58,562
You should complain to the police.

486
00:29:58,629 --> 00:30:01,564
Call them. Shall I dial the number?

487
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:08,267
This R Malhotra, whose ID you
have got... I am that person.

488
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:12,002
- Raju Malhotra.
- You?
- Yes.

489
00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:14,106
And I have thought, good student...

490
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:17,576
...that we should carry on
this mistake of fate.

491
00:30:17,648 --> 00:30:20,378
- Right?
- No! This will be a crime!

492
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:23,181
If the principal found out,
he will rusticate us!

493
00:30:24,321 --> 00:30:27,188
Look, principal will
only rusticate you.

494
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:31,325
You don't know what I will do.

495
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:34,364
You don't know me.

496
00:30:36,967 --> 00:30:38,366
By the way, I am such a fool.

497
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:42,028
If we think about it, how
will principal find out?

498
00:30:42,306 --> 00:30:44,240
Neither I will tell him
nor will you tell him.

499
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:45,967
And why not?

500
00:30:46,043 --> 00:30:47,977
If you will be in A class,
you will learn something.

501
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,512
I can even study in C class.

502
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:53,281
Exactly! This is called fate,
destiny, kismat.

503
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,284
Whatever you call it.

504
00:30:55,352 --> 00:30:59,015
Now I will be in A class. And
she will also be in A class.

505
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:00,147
Who?

506
00:31:00,224 --> 00:31:01,282
College's heroine!

507
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:04,027
Wow! Isn't that great!

508
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:07,397
Yes! Yes! Great! Great! Superb!

509
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:10,999
I am so happy. Shall
I tell you something?

510
00:31:11,235 --> 00:31:14,261
We both can be good friends.
Because I really like you.

511
00:31:15,105 --> 00:31:18,131
We are buddies, man. All right!

512
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:22,306
- So... friends.
- Yes. Friends.

513
00:31:22,379 --> 00:31:25,906
Not like this! Like men!
Friend vs friend!

514
00:31:25,983 --> 00:31:28,281
Malhotra vs Malhotra! Great!

515
00:31:29,286 --> 00:31:31,277
Let's go and check at the hospital...

516
00:31:31,355 --> 00:31:33,152
...whether we both had got
exchanged as babies or not.

517
00:31:35,292 --> 00:31:39,023
Don't worry. Henceforth nobody will
trouble you in this college.

518
00:31:39,096 --> 00:31:40,154
I am there.

519
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,096
I am being too emotional.
Embrace me.

520
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:45,560
A section!

521
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,904
Don't cry, friend! It happens!
It happens!

522
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:52,101
So what if you are in section
C this time? I will teach you.

523
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:53,905
Next time you will be in A section.

524
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:55,036
Don't worry! Don't worry!
Don't worry!

525
00:31:57,915 --> 00:32:01,578
Why is this scene going
on in my office?

526
00:32:02,052 --> 00:32:04,919
Sir, you have segregated
A, B and C section.

527
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:06,320
So he has got separated from me.

528
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:09,553
He is my friend. He is in
C section. He scored 30%.

529
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:10,924
I was consoling him.

530
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:14,190
Sir, actually the reason of
meeting you is my daddy.

531
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,323
Daddy?

532
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:17,924
Sir, P.K. Malhotra. Sir, he
was worried that I might...

533
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:20,937
...get spoiled with these
C class students.

534
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,337
He has thanked you for
your experiment.

535
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:25,339
What does your daddy do?

536
00:32:25,409 --> 00:32:26,876
Sir, he is an IAS officer.

537
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:29,309
- It can be seen.
- Yes, sir.

538
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,245
The values of the
family can be seen.

539
00:32:31,315 --> 00:32:32,373
Thank you, sir.

540
00:32:32,449 --> 00:32:34,280
- Are you in section A?
- Yes, sir.

541
00:32:35,886 --> 00:32:39,083
Sir, actually only a jeweler
can assess a gem.

542
00:32:39,156 --> 00:32:41,090
Enough! Enough! Enough!
No movie dialogues.

543
00:32:41,158 --> 00:32:42,455
Please. Okay.

544
00:32:42,526 --> 00:32:44,391
Do you want to say something?
Anything else?

545
00:32:44,461 --> 00:32:46,520
- Yes, sir. You see...
- Excuse me!

546
00:32:48,532 --> 00:32:50,363
- Sir!
- Yeah.

547
00:32:50,434 --> 00:32:52,493
- Sir, do you want to transfer Ajay to section C?
- Yeah.

548
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,970
- What about Sunil?
- Yeah! Of course.

549
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,132
- Sure, sir?
- Yeah!

550
00:32:57,207 --> 00:32:59,141
- But...
- Just do it!

551
00:32:59,209 --> 00:33:01,905
But sir, he deserves section A.

552
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:04,038
No arguments and no excuses. Okay.

553
00:33:04,114 --> 00:33:06,947
- Okay, sir.
- Don't teach a teacher. Sorry, sir.

554
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,580
Let's go!

555
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:23,561
'What is life?'

556
00:33:24,101 --> 00:33:25,159
'Compromise.'

557
00:33:25,869 --> 00:33:28,861
'If a bad boy wants to
become a good boy...

558
00:33:28,939 --> 00:33:30,873
...then I should help him.'

559
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:34,870
'And as it is in A class
he can't misbehave.'

560
00:33:36,046 --> 00:33:37,377
'He loves Rashmi.'

561
00:33:38,315 --> 00:33:40,010
'That's why he has taken
such a big risk.'

562
00:33:58,502 --> 00:34:01,164
What are you doing in this class?

563
00:34:01,238 --> 00:34:02,535
Ma'am, I am trying to feel you.

564
00:34:05,342 --> 00:34:07,469
I mean, I feel very
positive with you.

565
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:11,104
You were feeling so negative
about the exams.

566
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:14,412
Then... how did you score 90%?

567
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:17,011
No, ma'am. You thought
of me negatively.

568
00:34:17,087 --> 00:34:18,611
I had a negative outlook
towards exams.

569
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:21,480
You know what we are
taught in math.

570
00:34:21,925 --> 00:34:23,153
What?

571
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:28,320
That... if you mix 2 negatives,
the result is positive.

572
00:34:28,465 --> 00:34:31,866
Do you understand, ma'am...
what I am saying.

573
00:34:31,935 --> 00:34:33,368
Rocky, stand straight!

574
00:34:37,941 --> 00:34:39,340
Raju!

575
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,344
Move back! Let him come!

576
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:45,314
Raju has come! Raju! Raju! Raju!

577
00:34:45,382 --> 00:34:47,907
Raju! Raju! Raju!

578
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,154
- Silence!
- The bore has come!

579
00:34:52,222 --> 00:34:53,314
Silence! Silence!

580
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:57,190
Your philosophy professor
is in the class.

581
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,922
And you all have created a scene.

582
00:34:59,563 --> 00:35:02,532
We were just relieving tension
from our body and relaxing.

583
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,336
So that we all could feel
fresh for your lecture.

584
00:35:06,403 --> 00:35:09,531
Really? Really? Then... then...
why didn't you tell me before?

585
00:35:09,606 --> 00:35:13,007
You all don't know. I am not
just a philosophy professor.

586
00:35:13,977 --> 00:35:15,103
I am a yogi too.

587
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:16,407
Rogi (Patient)!

588
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,209
Sir, what aliment are
you suffering from?

589
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,307
Not Rogi, Yogi!

590
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:24,182
Yoga. I am a professor
of meditation.

591
00:35:24,254 --> 00:35:28,088
Of peace. Everybody close your eyes.

592
00:35:28,158 --> 00:35:31,855
Today we all will meditate before
the philosophy class.

593
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:33,123
For Anand (peace).

594
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:37,998
Who, sir? We know only one Anand.
Evergreen Dev Anand.

595
00:35:38,068 --> 00:35:40,866
To remain evergreen like Dev Anand...

596
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:42,997
...we should enjoy each joy of life.

597
00:35:43,073 --> 00:35:47,339
So everybody... close your eyes.
And repeat with me.

598
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:50,869
Om!

599
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:56,887
Om!

600
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:58,888
Om!

601
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:03,586
Om!

602
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,891
Om!

603
00:36:16,206 --> 00:36:21,906
Very good! Open your eyes! Look
it's so peaceful around.

604
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:24,914
All the evil powers have gone.

605
00:36:25,048 --> 00:36:27,881
Because they couldn't find peace.

606
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:34,450
Look at her. She too is looking
so peacefully at you. Look.

607
00:36:43,133 --> 00:36:44,930
It's not as pretty as you. But...

608
00:36:46,136 --> 00:36:47,933
I have got it for you.

609
00:36:48,939 --> 00:36:50,907
What happened? What happened?
What happened?

610
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:54,144
Sorry. I have allergy from flowers.

611
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,211
Oh no!

612
00:37:07,357 --> 00:37:12,556
Students... what made man evolve
from apes to humans?

613
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:16,090
Can you hear?

614
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:21,604
What made man evolve
from apes to humans?

615
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:24,297
Maybe he got bored of
eating bananas, sir.

616
00:37:26,276 --> 00:37:27,334
Very funny!

617
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,107
Change, revolution, transformation
is the norm of life.

618
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:34,844
We ourselves see how our body
and mind undergoes changes...

619
00:37:34,918 --> 00:37:36,112
...from childhood to old age.

620
00:37:36,453 --> 00:37:37,511
Great!

621
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:39,181
All right! Next!

622
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:53,136
You are a very impressive
student! I am pleased!

623
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:56,262
Yes, sir! When I get involved
in something...

624
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,500
...I get completely engrossed.

625
00:37:58,141 --> 00:37:59,369
Once I am in, I am in.

626
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,304
Stop doing that!

627
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:03,271
Okay, man!

628
00:38:04,481 --> 00:38:06,449
- Good morning! Good morning, sir!
- Good morning!

629
00:38:06,516 --> 00:38:08,108
Good morning!

630
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,313
Sit down. Have a seat. Please.

631
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:16,187
Look, no matter how much
a teacher teaches...

632
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,194
...he can't do anything till the
time the student doesn't learn.

633
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:20,091
It is not the teacher who teaches.

634
00:38:20,163 --> 00:38:21,630
It is the student who learns.

635
00:38:22,232 --> 00:38:25,224
Sir, it means the salary that
you get for teaching...

636
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:27,827
...we should actually
get it for learning.

637
00:38:29,439 --> 00:38:30,497
- Good!
- Thank you.

638
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:33,134
You just heard me. You
didn't understand me.

639
00:38:34,077 --> 00:38:35,135
- Anyway!
- Keep quiet!

640
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:36,270
There must be many students here...

641
00:38:36,346 --> 00:38:38,177
...who read Gayatri Mantra at home.

642
00:38:38,248 --> 00:38:39,306
Yes, sir!

643
00:38:40,183 --> 00:38:41,241
Recite it.

644
00:38:43,253 --> 00:38:44,311
Yes.

645
00:38:56,466 --> 00:38:57,524
Cool!

646
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,528
Correct!

647
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,097
Do you know the meaning?

648
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:09,303
Go, go! Say it!

649
00:39:09,379 --> 00:39:11,142
Sir, I don't know its meaning.

650
00:39:11,214 --> 00:39:14,445
Mummy taught me. And I memorized it.

651
00:39:15,452 --> 00:39:17,079
Exactly my point!

652
00:39:18,221 --> 00:39:19,279
This is another example
of learning...

653
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:20,414
...without understanding.

654
00:39:21,224 --> 00:39:23,556
Is there anybody here who knows
the meaning of Gayatri Mantra?

655
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:26,487
Yeah.

656
00:39:27,497 --> 00:39:31,058
It means... O Goddess, dispel
the darkness within us.

657
00:39:31,134 --> 00:39:34,433
And fill us with truth
and sacrifice.

658
00:39:34,504 --> 00:39:36,096
Good! Good!

659
00:39:38,308 --> 00:39:39,434
How much% have you scored?

660
00:39:39,509 --> 00:39:41,067
Sir, 92%...

661
00:39:42,112 --> 00:39:45,343
I mean... I can't get 92%,
sir. Its 35%.

662
00:39:46,149 --> 00:39:47,343
Silence! Look... before
laughing at him...

663
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:51,911
...we should think whether we
are laughing at ourselves.

664
00:39:52,489 --> 00:39:55,322
It's also possible that
this guy might score 90%.

665
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:58,326
Don't forget. Lotus grows
in marshy water.

666
00:39:58,395 --> 00:39:59,453
Yes, sir.

667
00:39:59,529 --> 00:40:01,224
One of my friend says
that a lotus like me...

668
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:03,323
...will have to remain
in marshy water.

669
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:12,340
- Tell me something. How did you know?
- What?

670
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,508
Gayatri Mantra.

671
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,013
- Gayatri Mantra?
- Yes. Gayatri Mantra.

672
00:40:18,248 --> 00:40:20,239
How do you know the meaning
of Gayatri Mantra?

673
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:23,286
You can also know it if you
concentrate on your studies.

674
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:25,179
Yes. But...

675
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,620
- We have not come to college to study.
- Then?

676
00:40:32,195 --> 00:40:34,095
What? Okay!

677
00:40:35,432 --> 00:40:37,297
Concentrate on the studies,
not on me.

678
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:39,494
- Let's go to the library.
- Where is library?

679
00:40:40,203 --> 00:40:41,295
In the college.

680
00:40:41,371 --> 00:40:43,236
Now don't ask where is
the college? Let's go.

681
00:40:44,474 --> 00:40:45,634
Come. Come on!

682
00:40:49,479 --> 00:40:50,537
What is this?

683
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:52,106
Library.

684
00:40:52,482 --> 00:40:55,474
Library? We dissect frogs there.

685
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:57,211
How will we study here?

686
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,016
That is laboratory. This is library.

687
00:41:00,323 --> 00:41:01,381
Let's go!

688
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:06,487
Oh my God!

689
00:41:07,297 --> 00:41:08,662
Why is it so silent?

690
00:41:09,232 --> 00:41:10,290
Has somebody died?

691
00:41:10,567 --> 00:41:12,159
- Silence!
- Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

692
00:41:12,235 --> 00:41:13,361
Come! Come on!

693
00:41:44,234 --> 00:41:45,565
- My brother Rambo!
- Yes man!

694
00:41:46,269 --> 00:41:48,203
Do you know why I am
drinking so much?

695
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:51,340
You love Dinky!

696
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:54,535
Lust!

697
00:41:55,512 --> 00:41:57,412
- I love her!
- Really?

698
00:41:58,215 --> 00:41:59,477
- I think she is sexy!
- Yes, man!

699
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:01,409
Destruction!

700
00:42:03,253 --> 00:42:04,379
Destruction!

701
00:42:04,454 --> 00:42:07,321
Great! Rashmi doesn't fall for you.

702
00:42:07,524 --> 00:42:10,084
And Dinky is falling for me.

703
00:42:12,529 --> 00:42:13,587
Hi!

704
00:42:13,663 --> 00:42:15,255
Look! Whenever you talk about her...

705
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:17,323
...she appears in front of you.

706
00:42:18,301 --> 00:42:19,359
Now she will come to me.

707
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:21,495
- Hi!
- Hi!

708
00:42:22,272 --> 00:42:24,934
I thought I can't find you anywhere
besides toilet and library.

709
00:42:26,376 --> 00:42:27,536
- What are you reading?
- Book!

710
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:29,403
Love story?

711
00:42:29,546 --> 00:42:32,447
His story. I mean history.

712
00:42:33,049 --> 00:42:34,209
Cool! Right now I have come to...

713
00:42:34,284 --> 00:42:36,149
...invite you both for
my birthday party.

714
00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:39,620
Saturday night at Rexy club.
It's too sexy!

715
00:42:40,423 --> 00:42:44,484
Dinky, 2 months ago you had
celebrated your birthday.

716
00:42:44,561 --> 00:42:45,619
What happened?

717
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:50,062
That... that was the birthday
of getting a passport.

718
00:42:50,133 --> 00:42:51,191
The real one is now.

719
00:42:52,435 --> 00:42:54,426
- You guys are going to come?
- Yes. Sure.

720
00:42:54,504 --> 00:42:56,096
Happy birthday, Dinky!

721
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:58,300
But you know I don't visit
parties and clubs.

722
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:01,907
Because I neither drink
nor can I dance.

723
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:04,137
Come on!

724
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:06,381
Show some loyalty towards section C.

725
00:43:06,449 --> 00:43:08,474
All C section students are coming!
You too will have to come!

726
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:09,644
But in section C...

727
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:12,648
He will come. I too will come.

728
00:43:13,523 --> 00:43:17,254
But... is nobody else
coming from class A?

729
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:20,458
Oh! Okay! I get it!

730
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:22,356
I had invited her.

731
00:43:23,066 --> 00:43:25,364
After countless excuses
she said... I will try.

732
00:43:26,169 --> 00:43:27,932
Yes. Please try.

733
00:43:28,171 --> 00:43:30,105
- Okay. I will try.
- Okay.

734
00:43:31,074 --> 00:43:34,066
Okay, guys! Bye! See you!

735
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:35,469
See you there!

736
00:43:35,545 --> 00:43:36,603
- Bye!
- Bye!

737
00:43:40,283 --> 00:43:42,114
You go there! I won't go!

738
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:46,211
The more you mix with these people
the better it is for you.

739
00:43:46,289 --> 00:43:47,551
It's good for your growth.

740
00:43:48,191 --> 00:43:50,489
Every good boy should
see the bad boy's side.

741
00:43:51,461 --> 00:43:54,430
Because afterwards he has to
venture in the bad world.

742
00:43:55,098 --> 00:43:56,292
So start the training from now only.

743
00:44:12,315 --> 00:44:15,375
My profligacy. My craziness.

744
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:19,354
Will find peace, beloved.

745
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:30,595
My profligacy. My craziness.

746
00:44:30,967 --> 00:44:34,528
Will find peace, beloved.

747
00:44:35,038 --> 00:44:40,476
If you will hold me,
I will not stagger.

748
00:44:42,545 --> 00:44:48,450
If you will hold me,
I will not stagger.

749
00:45:21,484 --> 00:45:25,011
There is intoxication
and loneliness.

750
00:45:25,188 --> 00:45:28,453
There is fervor.

751
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:36,224
Dawn and dusk. All the
time I remember you.

752
00:45:36,299 --> 00:45:39,268
Don't go. Don't go in this state.

753
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:42,464
Dwell me in your eyes.

754
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:45,235
Come. Come.

755
00:45:45,308 --> 00:45:48,038
Beloved, hide me.

756
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:51,475
My love. My craziness.

757
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:55,314
Will find peace, beloved.

758
00:45:55,452 --> 00:46:01,049
If you will hold me,
I will not stagger.

759
00:46:03,326 --> 00:46:09,128
If you will hold me,
I will not stagger.

760
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:19,266
Oh yeah!

761
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:34,186
The destination is so lovely.

762
00:46:34,257 --> 00:46:37,590
You have cast a spell.

763
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:41,588
There is the fervor of meeting.

764
00:46:42,165 --> 00:46:45,328
I see you everywhere.

765
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:48,166
Desires have aroused.

766
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:51,935
Even thoughts are intoxicated.

767
00:46:52,008 --> 00:46:54,875
This love is such.

768
00:46:54,944 --> 00:46:57,378
That now I don't like it anywhere.

769
00:46:57,447 --> 00:47:00,939
My desire. My craziness.

770
00:47:01,017 --> 00:47:04,544
Will find peace, beloved.

771
00:47:05,188 --> 00:47:10,353
If you will hold me,
I will not stagger.

772
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:18,195
If you will hold me,
I will not stagger.

773
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:26,106
If you will hold me,
I will not stagger.

774
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:33,576
If you will hold me,
I will not stagger.

775
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:40,584
If you will hold me,
I will not stagger.

776
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,850
Stop it!

777
00:47:46,095 --> 00:47:48,086
Hey! What are you doing? Leave her!

778
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:50,932
I swear I will call the cops!
I said leave her!

779
00:47:51,167 --> 00:47:52,429
- Raju!
- Leave her now!

780
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:54,528
Raju!

781
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:59,942
Listen! You can call the cops!
They will be helpful to you!

782
00:48:00,343 --> 00:48:02,140
Tomorrow you are going
to have a bad day!

783
00:48:05,448 --> 00:48:07,439
Where is your house, Dinky? Tell me.

784
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:12,314
I don't know. I don't want to
go home. I want to party.

785
00:48:19,262 --> 00:48:20,388
Hi, girls!

786
00:48:21,197 --> 00:48:22,255
What's up, man?

787
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:23,490
Hi!

788
00:48:24,467 --> 00:48:25,456
Hi!

789
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:28,471
I am sorry about last night!

790
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,298
I was drunk!

791
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,436
Sorry! Please!

792
00:48:35,311 --> 00:48:36,369
Friends!

793
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:38,414
We are not friends anymore! Now
I don't want to talk to you!

794
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:42,509
Stop!

795
00:48:47,156 --> 00:48:48,214
Where are you going?

796
00:48:51,394 --> 00:48:56,923
To get this... grow up!

797
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:03,464
Last night you were
acting very smugly.

798
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,869
Let's do one thing. Try
to enter the class.

799
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:15,576
What? What happened?

800
00:49:19,188 --> 00:49:20,883
Do you want to be beaten
in front of everybody...

801
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:22,083
...or alone in the class?

802
00:49:26,195 --> 00:49:27,526
- In the class.
- Let's go.

803
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,325
- Come!
- Let's go!

804
00:49:29,465 --> 00:49:30,523
Come on!

805
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,431
- Man!
- He is gone!

806
00:49:34,437 --> 00:49:35,495
Don't hit me too badly!

807
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:43,376
Wow!

808
00:49:43,446 --> 00:49:44,572
Beat me! Beat me!

809
00:49:53,289 --> 00:49:54,347
Oh my God!

810
00:50:23,586 --> 00:50:24,951
- Hey!
- Yes!

811
00:50:27,423 --> 00:50:28,481
Such a big book?

812
00:50:30,226 --> 00:50:33,286
It's not big. Must
be 15-16 years old.

813
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:35,255
What?

814
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:40,129
I mean... I was 15-16 years old when
I read a book for the first time.

815
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:42,197
15-16 years old!

816
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:45,432
Could you understand all
this at that time?

817
00:50:45,508 --> 00:50:47,908
Yes. I learned everything
when I was 10 years old.

818
00:50:47,977 --> 00:50:49,069
I understood.

819
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:52,181
But... I got the chance when
I was 15-16 years old.

820
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:57,218
I think you are really interested
in this subject.

821
00:50:57,286 --> 00:50:58,344
Yes. To tell you the truth I have...

822
00:50:58,421 --> 00:51:00,582
...always been interested
only in this subject.

823
00:51:01,157 --> 00:51:03,591
I want to reach the depth
of this subject.

824
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:09,597
I want to drown in the lips...
I mean the depth of the words.

825
00:51:11,467 --> 00:51:14,402
To tell you the truth, I have never
been interested in this subject.

826
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:18,930
You know. But I think I should
start taking interest.

827
00:51:19,175 --> 00:51:20,665
Yes. I am ready to give.

828
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:23,570
My knowledge.

829
00:51:24,547 --> 00:51:30,315
My philosophy is that... when a
person studies these books...

830
00:51:30,386 --> 00:51:32,547
...he should have a practical
experience too.

831
00:51:33,189 --> 00:51:35,214
One should be open to every
experience in life.

832
00:51:36,492 --> 00:51:39,620
Yeah! And do you know
what my new subject is?

833
00:51:40,396 --> 00:51:42,057
- What?
- You.

834
00:51:43,132 --> 00:51:45,396
Jokes apart. I am really impressed.

835
00:51:46,202 --> 00:51:48,067
You read Karl Marx. I mean...

836
00:51:48,337 --> 00:51:52,171
No, jokes apart. I was reading
it just to impress you.

837
00:51:52,241 --> 00:51:53,333
Seriously.

838
00:51:55,144 --> 00:51:56,907
- You are too smart!
- I am!

839
00:51:58,247 --> 00:52:00,545
- That's why you like me.
- Who told you that?

840
00:52:01,217 --> 00:52:02,343
I know.

841
00:52:12,061 --> 00:52:13,119
Smile!

842
00:52:15,498 --> 00:52:17,363
You can't do that! It's bad manners!

843
00:52:17,433 --> 00:52:19,128
Of course! I can! I am a bad boy!

844
00:52:19,335 --> 00:52:21,667
Rajan, click my snap too.

845
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:25,498
Battery is low.

846
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:30,208
The ambience is romantic.

847
00:52:30,279 --> 00:52:32,042
Let's fall in love.

848
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:34,345
Come, come, come.

849
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:37,045
Come, beloved.

850
00:53:03,479 --> 00:53:04,537
Rashmi!

851
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:09,350
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!

852
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:16,087
Happy birthday dear papa!
Happy birthday to you!

853
00:53:17,426 --> 00:53:18,484
I am sorry, papa.

854
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:22,231
I know you said in the college
and in public life...

855
00:53:22,298 --> 00:53:26,234
...we both will behave like
principal and student...

856
00:53:26,302 --> 00:53:28,031
...and not like father and daughter.

857
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:32,300
But today I know... a principal
doesn't need a student...

858
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,138
...but a father needs his daughter.

859
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,939
Happy birthday, papa!

860
00:53:37,446 --> 00:53:38,572
Yes, dear. Come.

861
00:53:39,248 --> 00:53:41,478
- So how is everything?
- Good.

862
00:53:41,984 --> 00:53:43,611
Tell me. How are your
studies going on?

863
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:47,016
Very good. Is the principal
asking this?

864
00:53:47,089 --> 00:53:48,147
Papa is asking this.

865
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:49,316
- Very good!
- Good!

866
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:52,384
Do you know... this time I am
thinking of studying a new subject.

867
00:53:52,461 --> 00:53:54,224
A new subject? Which one?

868
00:53:54,463 --> 00:53:56,624
Karl Marx's theory of communism.

869
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:01,466
Oh! You and communism! That
sounds interesting!

870
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:04,973
That guy is interesting!

871
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:06,640
You call Karl Marx as a guy?

872
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:12,045
Papa, not Karl Marx! Rajan!
Rajan Malhotra!

873
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:13,306
Rajan Malhotra?

874
00:54:13,382 --> 00:54:15,145
Yes, papa. Do you know?

875
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:18,244
I always thought him to be
a vagabond and useless guy.

876
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:20,452
His behavior too is like that.

877
00:54:21,457 --> 00:54:24,255
But... in spite of all the
naughtiness and mischief...

878
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:28,024
...he is the guy who has scored
the highest% in our class.

879
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:30,094
92%!

880
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:33,097
- Great! Rashmi!
- Yes.

881
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,336
I would like to meet
that boy. Bring him.

882
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:37,469
He has a friend in section
C. Bring him too.

883
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,269
Okay, papa. He is so cool!

884
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:40,400
Yes! Too much!

885
00:54:40,476 --> 00:54:43,274
I think we both got exchanged
in the hospital!

886
00:54:43,412 --> 00:54:46,040
What your dad wanted, my dad got it.

887
00:54:46,115 --> 00:54:47,548
What my dad wanted, your dad got it.

888
00:54:48,484 --> 00:54:50,452
I mean, why can't they be
happy the way we are?

889
00:54:50,519 --> 00:54:52,487
I know. They always want to
change us according to them.

890
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:54,045
Hang on! Rashmi! Rashmi!

891
00:54:55,191 --> 00:54:56,249
Yes, Rashmi!

892
00:54:56,325 --> 00:54:57,986
Listen. I have some work from you.

893
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,118
Tell me.

894
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:02,226
Principal has called you and
Raju home this evening.

895
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:06,401
Home? Principal has
called us home? Why?

896
00:55:07,236 --> 00:55:09,466
I think he is very impressed
with you both.

897
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:12,070
He is impressed! Okay! Okay!

898
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:13,570
Listen! Another thing!

899
00:55:14,043 --> 00:55:15,908
I wanted some help
in some questions.

900
00:55:16,245 --> 00:55:19,078
You want some help in some
questions. Speak loudly!

901
00:55:20,149 --> 00:55:21,480
Rashmi, hang on! Here
the network is low.

902
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:23,518
Hang on! Hang on! She is
asking some questions.

903
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:24,644
You listen to the question.
I will give her the answer.

904
00:55:47,176 --> 00:55:48,234
Thank you. Bye.

905
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:49,369
All right.

906
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:51,172
Oh no! I barely managed to escape.

907
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:53,215
This time you were here.
What will I do next time?

908
00:55:53,282 --> 00:55:56,115
Tell her I don't know.
I will find out.

909
00:55:56,185 --> 00:55:59,052
At the most she will think
you don't know the answer.

910
00:55:59,221 --> 00:56:01,246
At least you won't give
the wrong answer.

911
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:05,559
Yes. I will do this the
next time. Thank you.

912
00:56:07,296 --> 00:56:08,422
Come on. We have to meet the
principal in the evening.

913
00:56:08,497 --> 00:56:09,555
Come on!

914
00:56:15,504 --> 00:56:16,562
- Nirmala.
- Yes, sir.

915
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:21,332
Arts faculty second year section
A student Rajan Malhotra...

916
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:24,243
...and section C student
Raju Malhotra.

917
00:56:24,413 --> 00:56:27,507
I want their original admission
forms and files. Immediately.

918
00:56:28,117 --> 00:56:29,584
Sorry, sir. It will take some time.

919
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:31,451
I should get it tomorrow
morning at my home.

920
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,011
Okay. It's a bit urgent. And
please keep it to yourself.

921
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:35,182
Okay, sir.

922
00:56:47,436 --> 00:56:49,370
'Sir, 92%...'

923
00:56:50,172 --> 00:56:53,335
'I mean... I can't get
92%, sir. Its 35%.'

924
00:56:56,445 --> 00:56:58,606
'Sir, actually the reason of
meeting you is my daddy.'

925
00:56:59,081 --> 00:57:00,139
'Daddy?'

926
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:01,274
'Sir, P.K. Malhotra.'

927
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:03,215
'Sir, he was worried that I might...

928
00:57:03,285 --> 00:57:05,082
...get spoiled with these
C class students.'

929
00:57:14,096 --> 00:57:15,154
Principal sir!

930
00:57:33,182 --> 00:57:35,514
You wanted to meet Rajan
Malhotra, didn't you?

931
00:57:36,452 --> 00:57:39,285
He is Rajan Malhotra. And
he is Raju Malhotra.

932
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:45,155
Nice to know you... Raju Malhotra...

933
00:57:45,227 --> 00:57:46,387
...and Rajan Malhotra.

934
00:57:47,463 --> 00:57:49,294
Let's shake hands, my friend.

935
00:57:58,207 --> 00:57:59,401
Bye Mr. Awasthi.

936
00:58:13,456 --> 00:58:14,514
Dr. Awasthi.

937
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:18,319
Dr. Awasthi.

938
00:58:20,229 --> 00:58:23,323
- You are thinking something.
- No, no.

939
00:58:24,433 --> 00:58:27,095
You are hiding something, good
fathers don't hide anything...

940
00:58:27,169 --> 00:58:28,466
- ...from their children.
- No dear.

941
00:58:28,971 --> 00:58:31,496
Papa, I can read your eyes.

942
00:58:31,974 --> 00:58:34,306
As if these are your books
and not my eyes.

943
00:58:34,376 --> 00:58:36,901
Really, where was
your concentration?

944
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:40,341
You were watering the cactus.

945
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:43,418
Oh No.

946
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:45,249
Tell me the truth, what
were you thinking?

947
00:58:47,156 --> 00:58:49,021
I was thinking about those two boys.

948
00:58:49,091 --> 00:58:50,422
Really, how did you like those two?

949
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,218
They are okay.

950
00:58:52,294 --> 00:58:54,524
- Okay or nice?
- Nice.

951
00:58:55,097 --> 00:58:56,257
Nice or very nice.

952
00:58:58,267 --> 00:59:00,201
Dear, people are not what
they seem to be...

953
00:59:00,269 --> 00:59:03,102
...and what cannot be seen,
it is not there.

954
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:05,265
Be careful of those two okay.

955
00:59:05,407 --> 00:59:09,605
Papa, I am your daughter my
eyes cannot be deceived.

956
00:59:10,112 --> 00:59:11,170
Okay.

957
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:12,607
See you in college sir.

958
00:59:13,215 --> 00:59:15,945
Yes Ms. Rashmi Awasthi,
you may proceed.

959
00:59:20,289 --> 00:59:23,383
Pass it, pass it here, here, here.

960
00:59:37,339 --> 00:59:39,239
Pass it, pass it here,
here, here. Come on.

961
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:44,238
Okay guys I am out.

962
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:45,438
Take care of him today.

963
00:59:49,051 --> 00:59:50,143
Why did you push me?

964
00:59:51,353 --> 00:59:52,411
Can't you watch where
you are playing?

965
00:59:52,488 --> 00:59:53,546
Shall I show you how
you should play?

966
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,355
Cool Raju, you have
thought me enough...

967
00:59:56,425 --> 00:59:58,985
...so that I can show
him how to play.

968
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:02,493
You! You will teach me!
You will teach me!

969
01:00:03,098 --> 01:00:04,656
Yeah Rambo, and remember one thing...

970
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:08,970
...when a player is practicing
his new game...

971
01:00:09,538 --> 01:00:10,596
...don't disturb him.

972
01:00:12,575 --> 01:00:15,271
Did you hear that, come
on get out of here.

973
01:00:15,344 --> 01:00:18,609
Yo man, I will be back.

974
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:24,146
So my brave man, you
learn very fast.

975
01:00:25,387 --> 01:00:26,513
Keep it up.

976
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:34,359
- May we come in sir?
- Yeah, come in.

977
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:42,901
Sir if you are busy, then we
will come back later sir.

978
01:00:43,138 --> 01:00:44,503
Yes sir, tomorrow, the day
after, or even later.

979
01:00:44,573 --> 01:00:45,972
I said, come.

980
01:00:49,478 --> 01:00:50,638
Sir, is there something
important sir.

981
01:00:51,313 --> 01:00:53,508
Something like that, take a seat.

982
01:01:00,222 --> 01:01:03,658
I was very pleased to see
your AC combination.

983
01:01:05,527 --> 01:01:12,433
- AC?
- A means you and C means you.

984
01:01:13,068 --> 01:01:15,434
No sir, I am in the A section.

985
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:20,206
You are in C section, but
you answer like A section.

986
01:01:21,343 --> 01:01:24,005
Actually sir, he teaches
me all that.

987
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:25,068
He is very helpful.

988
01:01:25,447 --> 01:01:28,211
But Mr. A, can you
help me with my PC.

989
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:33,285
There is a CD of modern education,
it is not running.

990
01:01:33,355 --> 01:01:34,413
Oh sure, give it to me.

991
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:39,325
Go into the programs of the windows
and break the code of the CD...

992
01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:41,158
...then it starts running itself.

993
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:43,323
I have thought him that.

994
01:01:44,199 --> 01:01:45,257
It is an Indian software.

995
01:01:51,573 --> 01:01:52,631
This, this.

996
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:02,508
Great.

997
01:02:03,552 --> 01:02:06,578
I cannot send this MMS
from my mobile...

998
01:02:06,655 --> 01:02:09,385
...it is about the ragging
case in Haryana...

999
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:11,653
Sir, this is that Amita Gupta
case I will show it to you.

1000
01:02:12,227 --> 01:02:14,354
Go into the menu, scroll down...

1001
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:18,232
...and here is your MMS sir.

1002
01:02:20,502 --> 01:02:22,060
- It's nice isn't it sir.
- Yeah.

1003
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:28,272
Surprising, I thought that you will
solve the computer problem...

1004
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:30,175
...and you will go for the mobile.

1005
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,612
But your habits seem
to have changed.

1006
01:02:34,116 --> 01:02:36,141
Sir, It's out habit to teach
each other all this.

1007
01:02:36,218 --> 01:02:38,118
We always believe in exchange...

1008
01:02:39,254 --> 01:02:42,052
I mean we believe in skill exchange.

1009
01:02:42,124 --> 01:02:43,182
Something happened.

1010
01:02:43,258 --> 01:02:45,158
No sir, I have brought him
a new pair of shoes.

1011
01:02:45,227 --> 01:02:47,218
Yes sir, whenever
he buys new shoes...

1012
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:49,230
...I always have to bear...
I mean wear it

1013
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:54,197
- Come on.
- Bye-bye sir.

1014
01:02:54,269 --> 01:02:55,327
Bye sir.

1015
01:02:57,139 --> 01:03:00,131
Rajan... thanks.

1016
01:03:01,443 --> 01:03:02,501
My pleasure sir.

1017
01:03:02,578 --> 01:03:03,636
Our pleasure sir.

1018
01:03:04,146 --> 01:03:07,206
You will get many more pleasures
like this, in near future.

1019
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:17,656
I feel like eating something.

1020
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:21,193
We are in such grave trouble and
you are thinking about food.

1021
01:03:21,397 --> 01:03:23,126
I want to take an oath... oath...

1022
01:03:23,198 --> 01:03:25,393
...that we will never get entrapped
in problems like this again.

1023
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:30,368
Think about it, you will never lie.

1024
01:03:31,006 --> 01:03:32,132
Are you sure.

1025
01:03:32,207 --> 01:03:34,300
Actually speaking, I am not sure.

1026
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:37,203
To tell you the truth, I am
enjoying this role change a lot.

1027
01:03:40,182 --> 01:03:41,308
What a life.

1028
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:48,048
'I was very pleased to see
your AC combination.'

1029
01:03:52,227 --> 01:03:57,221
'A means you and C means you, AC.'

1030
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:10,071
- Hi Humdum.
- Say Gumnam.

1031
01:04:10,145 --> 01:04:12,443
Tomorrow is a Sunday,
and she has agreed.

1032
01:04:12,514 --> 01:04:14,072
- Who?
- Rashmi, who else.

1033
01:04:14,149 --> 01:04:15,207
Agreed for what?

1034
01:04:15,284 --> 01:04:17,445
To go on a long drive, I will
say and she will smile.

1035
01:04:18,153 --> 01:04:20,986
- I will read out a poetry and...
- She will listen to you.

1036
01:04:21,323 --> 01:04:23,314
She likes to hear to
Tennyson's poetry.

1037
01:04:24,526 --> 01:04:26,858
I know only Anand Bakshi
and Samir's songs.

1038
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,165
- Are you coming?
- No, I am not coming.

1039
01:04:30,232 --> 01:04:34,032
Love can be confirmed only
when you sing songs.

1040
01:04:34,102 --> 01:04:36,536
Try and adopt my style, and
Dinky will fall for you.

1041
01:04:37,172 --> 01:04:39,538
- I am not filmy.
- Then become one.

1042
01:04:40,108 --> 01:04:42,269
Nowadays every person
is filmy, understood.

1043
01:05:10,272 --> 01:05:11,330
- Hello
- Hi.

1044
01:05:12,207 --> 01:05:14,072
- Did I disturb you?
- Yes you did.

1045
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:18,372
You study the entire day,
but you score just 35%.

1046
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:20,340
You are a 100% failure.

1047
01:05:20,415 --> 01:05:21,541
Shall we talk about something else?

1048
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:24,645
It is raining outside.

1049
01:05:26,221 --> 01:05:29,349
Strange isn't it, it is raining
in the rainy season too.

1050
01:05:36,164 --> 01:05:39,258
Come out of the house.

1051
01:05:41,169 --> 01:05:42,227
Come out.

1052
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,307
Touch the rain drops, and
listen to its music.

1053
01:05:51,179 --> 01:05:52,305
How does it feel?

1054
01:05:52,447 --> 01:05:54,347
It feels strange.

1055
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:57,479
And what do you call this feeling?

1056
01:05:57,553 --> 01:05:59,145
What? What do you call it?

1057
01:06:00,455 --> 01:06:02,616
Love. I love you.

1058
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:08,554
Hello.

1059
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:13,397
It is the climate of love,
come and fall in love.

1060
01:06:14,069 --> 01:06:18,403
Come, come, come my beloved come.

1061
01:06:20,208 --> 01:06:27,341
There is nothing else
in this heart.

1062
01:06:40,028 --> 01:06:43,361
It is the climate of love,
come and fall in love.

1063
01:06:43,432 --> 01:06:47,061
Come, come, come my beloved come.

1064
01:06:47,135 --> 01:06:50,866
It is the climate of love,
come and fall in love.

1065
01:06:51,006 --> 01:06:54,305
Come, come, come my beloved come.

1066
01:06:54,376 --> 01:07:00,406
Your hopes.

1067
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:08,382
Your intoxication.

1068
01:07:09,491 --> 01:07:14,394
There is nothing else
in this heart.

1069
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:23,399
There is nothing else
in this heart.

1070
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:37,310
My heartbeat indicates.

1071
01:07:38,253 --> 01:07:44,123
You are my love, you are my
beloved, you are my life.

1072
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:48,290
My heartbeat indicates.

1073
01:07:49,097 --> 01:07:55,058
You are my dream, you the desire
of my impatient heart.

1074
01:07:56,271 --> 01:08:03,370
You are my world, every
saga starts with you.

1075
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:20,495
You are immersed in me.

1076
01:08:21,463 --> 01:08:27,993
Your desires, your feelings
are the essence of my life.

1077
01:08:29,137 --> 01:08:31,435
I crave for you.

1078
01:08:32,407 --> 01:08:36,241
I ask for you in my prayers
from the Lord.

1079
01:08:36,311 --> 01:08:38,404
You are my only desire.

1080
01:08:38,914 --> 01:08:42,441
You are my insanity.

1081
01:08:43,151 --> 01:08:46,086
I have fallen in love with you.

1082
01:08:47,155 --> 01:08:50,420
It is the climate of love,
come and fall in love.

1083
01:08:50,492 --> 01:08:54,019
Come, come, come my beloved come.

1084
01:08:54,096 --> 01:08:57,497
It is the climate of love,
come and fall in love.

1085
01:08:57,999 --> 01:09:01,264
Come, come, come my beloved come.

1086
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:09,201
There is nothing else
in this heart.

1087
01:09:09,277 --> 01:09:16,206
There is nothing else
in this heart.

1088
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:40,066
My daughter who used
to befriends books...

1089
01:09:40,142 --> 01:09:41,632
...today she is befriending flowers.

1090
01:09:42,244 --> 01:09:43,302
Such a change.

1091
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:49,640
Look dear, I can understand
your emotions very well.

1092
01:09:51,119 --> 01:09:56,079
But what if the one you love,
turns out to be a deceit.

1093
01:09:57,492 --> 01:10:00,154
Girls those are blind,
only they are deceived.

1094
01:10:01,329 --> 01:10:04,423
Even those dear, who
close their eyes.

1095
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:08,936
You are right papa, but
I have closed my eyes...

1096
01:10:09,004 --> 01:10:10,130
...after thinking it through.

1097
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:15,268
God bless you.

1098
01:10:16,578 --> 01:10:21,481
Awasthi, you will have
to open her eyes.

1099
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:25,247
My dears, the new experiment
that I have done...

1100
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:28,414
...by dividing the classes
in sections.

1101
01:10:29,157 --> 01:10:30,215
I have been observing that...

1102
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:31,350
...it has been bearing new fruits.

1103
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:33,286
A lot of things have changed.

1104
01:10:34,229 --> 01:10:35,287
Students have changed too.

1105
01:10:36,464 --> 01:10:38,295
There are some students
in section C...

1106
01:10:38,366 --> 01:10:40,129
...that deserve section A.

1107
01:10:40,202 --> 01:10:42,295
And there are some students
in section A...

1108
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:44,634
...that deserve section C.

1109
01:10:45,207 --> 01:10:47,334
And that's why, for everyone
revaluation...

1110
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:49,502
...it is necessary to
have another exam.

1111
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:53,241
An interim exam, so
that as of today...

1112
01:10:53,315 --> 01:10:55,408
...we will know that
who deserves what.

1113
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:57,209
Correct.

1114
01:10:57,285 --> 01:11:01,585
So students, get ready for new
exams on the 10th of September.

1115
01:11:04,192 --> 01:11:05,250
Clap please.

1116
01:11:05,393 --> 01:11:06,451
Thank you.

1117
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:13,560
I don't care about the world.

1118
01:11:15,237 --> 01:11:16,670
What if Rashmi leaves me?

1119
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:19,935
That's true, now I will have
to leave Dinky's class...

1120
01:11:20,008 --> 01:11:21,168
...and will have to sit in class A.

1121
01:11:21,409 --> 01:11:23,673
Along with the exams, It is
the question of our love too.

1122
01:11:25,113 --> 01:11:28,947
Hi Rajan, aren't you happy
about the re-examination?

1123
01:11:31,152 --> 01:11:34,053
You... why are the both of you upset.

1124
01:11:35,223 --> 01:11:38,386
See, see even Rashmi is saying
exactly what I was.

1125
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,222
When did you say that?
I was saying that.

1126
01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:45,190
Actually Rashmi, he is a bit upset.

1127
01:11:46,301 --> 01:11:48,166
He was thinking that, if
he scores less marks...

1128
01:11:48,236 --> 01:11:52,400
...then you will, I mean...

1129
01:11:55,243 --> 01:11:58,371
Every girl dreams that, his
partner should be handsome...

1130
01:11:58,446 --> 01:12:03,076
...dashing, a bit intelligent,
and that's all.

1131
01:12:03,251 --> 01:12:04,582
That's what I want.

1132
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:07,481
Awasthi sir has complete
faith on the both of you.

1133
01:12:07,555 --> 01:12:08,613
Really.

1134
01:12:17,565 --> 01:12:20,398
Did you hear, what Rashmi said?

1135
01:12:21,536 --> 01:12:26,098
Yes, she wants a first class,
95% scoring life partner.

1136
01:12:29,277 --> 01:12:31,438
That means I lost in
the battle of love.

1137
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:35,377
Hundred percent, and not only
you even I have lost.

1138
01:12:36,284 --> 01:12:38,343
Bringing Dinky from 35% to 75%...

1139
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:40,047
...will take me my entire life time.

1140
01:12:41,222 --> 01:12:43,554
But it is necessary, not for her...

1141
01:12:44,225 --> 01:12:46,216
...it is necessary for the
peace of my own mind.

1142
01:12:46,294 --> 01:12:48,228
That I make her a serious
student too.

1143
01:12:51,099 --> 01:12:54,466
Then go, get some peace
of mind and let me study.

1144
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:10,447
Come on Dinky, let us study.

1145
01:13:12,253 --> 01:13:18,089
What is the hurry we still
have the entire night.

1146
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:19,387
That's why there is a hurry...

1147
01:13:19,461 --> 01:13:21,656
...I don't want to spend the
entire night at your home.

1148
01:13:22,263 --> 01:13:24,595
Okay, you can leave
tomorrow morning.

1149
01:13:25,333 --> 01:13:28,496
What? Look Dinky I don't
like such jokes.

1150
01:13:29,104 --> 01:13:30,162
Come on, let's study.

1151
01:13:31,239 --> 01:13:34,538
Come on, today I will teach
you a new way of studying.

1152
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:38,170
- A new way?
- Yes, it is very easy.

1153
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:40,613
It is called, SS.

1154
01:13:41,182 --> 01:13:43,548
SS, you mean serious studies right

1155
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:49,082
- Strip study.
- What?

1156
01:13:50,225 --> 01:13:55,060
Come on, I will ask
you a few questions.

1157
01:13:55,363 --> 01:13:59,629
And for every question,
I will strip something.

1158
01:14:00,101 --> 01:14:03,969
Dinky, this is a very
dangerous way to study.

1159
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:07,504
I know, that's why I have
thought of this way.

1160
01:14:10,278 --> 01:14:14,237
Okay the first question,
the truth is often...

1161
01:14:14,315 --> 01:14:16,510
...a terrible weapon of destruction.

1162
01:14:17,218 --> 01:14:20,381
- Who said that?
- Alfred Adler.

1163
01:14:20,455 --> 01:14:21,513
Right.

1164
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:38,169
Next question, there is
a saying that a man...

1165
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:41,504
...should love his neighbor
as himself...

1166
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:45,271
...and in a few hundred years,
it should become...

1167
01:14:45,346 --> 01:14:47,610
...as natural, as breathing itself.

1168
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:53,353
- Who said that?
- Alfred Adler.

1169
01:14:54,155 --> 01:14:55,213
Correct.

1170
01:15:01,529 --> 01:15:05,056
Okay, next question.

1171
01:15:06,234 --> 01:15:10,170
Love in itself, in the form
of longing and depreciation...

1172
01:15:10,238 --> 01:15:14,504
...lowers the self regard.
Who said this?

1173
01:15:15,477 --> 01:15:17,468
Alfred... Alfred.

1174
01:15:21,449 --> 01:15:25,249
Alfred Hitchcock.

1175
01:15:26,454 --> 01:15:28,115
Sorry, wrong answer.

1176
01:15:28,289 --> 01:15:29,847
No, no, no wait, wait.

1177
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:32,456
John Grey, John Grey,
John Grey, John Grey.

1178
01:15:33,128 --> 01:15:34,595
Oops wrong answer.

1179
01:15:35,163 --> 01:15:37,290
Stop, stop, stop I know, I know this

1180
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:40,396
Jung, Karl Gustak Jung.

1181
01:15:40,468 --> 01:15:42,459
- Yeah, yeah.
- Wrong answer.

1182
01:15:43,438 --> 01:15:46,601
- No.
- Sorry, next time.

1183
01:15:59,454 --> 01:16:00,512
Best of luck brother.

1184
01:16:04,225 --> 01:16:06,193
No matter how much you study...

1185
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:07,319
...you are not going to pass.

1186
01:16:08,429 --> 01:16:12,092
'Every girl dreams that, his
partner should be handsome...

1187
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:16,297
...dashing, a bit intelligent,
and that's all.'

1188
01:16:16,437 --> 01:16:18,166
'That's what I want.'

1189
01:16:33,421 --> 01:16:35,389
Whose empty seat is that?

1190
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:37,182
Rajan Malhotra.

1191
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:58,479
- You are not writing the exams.
- No.

1192
01:16:59,214 --> 01:17:03,480
All the questions and it's answers,
you have it don't you.

1193
01:17:05,453 --> 01:17:09,321
Yes, but giving an incomplete
answer to any question...

1194
01:17:09,390 --> 01:17:10,550
...is like making a fool of yourself.

1195
01:17:11,192 --> 01:17:13,626
On the right time, I will give the
complete answer to all the questions.

1196
01:17:15,029 --> 01:17:16,621
If you want to give me something...
...then give me another chance.

1197
01:17:20,301 --> 01:17:22,565
Okay, I give you another chance.

1198
01:17:35,384 --> 01:17:38,842
In today's meeting, we want
to give you all a good news.

1199
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:43,257
And that is after 5 years, our
college will take part...

1200
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:47,694
...in the inter-college
youth festival.

1201
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:49,659
Congratulations.

1211
01:18:35,911 --> 01:18:37,640
Wear the cap, wear the cap.

1212
01:18:37,712 --> 01:18:40,442
He is not Himesh Reshamiyan,
he is Himesh Chandra.

1213
01:18:42,918 --> 01:18:45,978
And now comes the dance competition.

And now for the quiz competition.

1218
01:19:23,692 --> 01:19:27,219
In which you need brain, brilliance
and knowledge...

1219
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:29,729
...instead of your heart.

1220
01:19:30,298 --> 01:19:32,960
And that is, Rajan Malhotra.

1221
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:35,765
Give him a big hand.

1222
01:19:37,572 --> 01:19:38,800
Give him a big hand.

1223
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:53,853
All the best my dear.

1224
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:10,599
That old man Awasthi insulted
our Rambo a lot.

1225
01:20:10,672 --> 01:20:13,266
Our Rambo is a dancing champion...

1226
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:17,402
...and whom did he select,
that idiot Raju Malhotra.

1227
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:19,470
Malhotra, I can't take it.

1228
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:21,778
Malhotra, even I have to settle
an old score with him.

1229
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:24,284
That's a good idea, now only...

1230
01:20:24,352 --> 01:20:26,479
...you can spread this destruction.

1231
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:29,421
After all I am an ex-best student.

1232
01:21:54,909 --> 01:21:57,377
Doctor sir, how is Awasthi sir?

1233
01:21:57,445 --> 01:22:00,710
He is still unconscious,
otherwise he is fine.

1234
01:22:01,316 --> 01:22:03,580
Look, visiting hours are over.

1235
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:04,778
You can leave now.

1236
01:22:04,853 --> 01:22:07,413
Okay sir, then we will
take Rashmi along too.

1237
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:09,514
No, it is necessary for
one relative to say back.

1238
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:12,583
I think it well be better for
her daughter to stay back.

1239
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:14,754
- Daughter
- What did you say?

1240
01:22:14,829 --> 01:22:16,387
Rashmi is his daughter.

1241
01:22:16,464 --> 01:22:19,490
Yes, it is written Rashmi
Awasthi on the form.

1242
01:22:19,567 --> 01:22:21,000
Are you sure doctor?

1243
01:22:21,336 --> 01:22:24,772
I am telling you, please
you can leave.

1244
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:02,473
Now just drink milk and study,
and forget everything else.

1245
01:23:03,545 --> 01:23:05,570
That Rashmi Awasthi's
daughter fooled us.

1246
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:07,774
Even you fooled her by posing
as an A class student.

1247
01:23:07,849 --> 01:23:11,307
But I am an A class student, I am.

1248
01:23:13,688 --> 01:23:17,419
Look, Awasthi sir is a nice man.

1249
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:18,925
There is only one thing left to do.

1250
01:23:18,993 --> 01:23:20,255
Go and meet him in the evening...

1251
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:21,659
...and tell him the truth.

1252
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:26,365
- What?
- That we have done a very big fraud.

1253
01:23:27,268 --> 01:23:30,328
And sir, we cannot take
part in this competition.

1254
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:34,941
Truth is the only way to
solve a grave problem.

1255
01:23:43,785 --> 01:23:45,480
Sir, we want to tell you something.

1256
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:52,884
Sir, we cannot take part
in this competition.

1257
01:23:55,296 --> 01:23:56,888
You should not take part.

1258
01:23:58,366 --> 01:24:01,233
The truth that you want
to tell me now...

1259
01:24:01,302 --> 01:24:03,702
...I know about the truth
long back, yes.

1260
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:06,231
You played the game
of changing class...

1261
01:24:06,307 --> 01:24:07,672
...so I played the game of faith!

1262
01:24:07,742 --> 01:24:10,233
Even though I knew
about your truth...

1263
01:24:10,311 --> 01:24:13,303
...I sent your name for the
inter-collegiate competition.

1264
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:14,507
Do you know why?

1265
01:24:15,316 --> 01:24:19,252
If you give a responsible job
to a weak student with faith...

1266
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:23,586
...he can see his strength
in that faith!

1267
01:24:24,325 --> 01:24:26,850
He can win! He can win
even though he losses!

1268
01:24:27,529 --> 01:24:29,759
No, but the both of you.

1269
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:32,356
The both of you have
lost from yourself.

1270
01:24:33,868 --> 01:24:36,803
And how dare you come here
and ask for forgiveness!

1271
01:24:38,273 --> 01:24:40,207
By thrashing Dinesh you
have acted like goons...

1272
01:24:40,275 --> 01:24:41,674
...and not like good boys!

1273
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:44,202
I could have lodged a complaint
against them...

1274
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:45,610
...with the police, what was
the need for you to go?

1275
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:48,274
Because you had a selfish
purpose in it.

1276
01:24:49,384 --> 01:24:52,410
You wanted to impress
me, my daughter.

1277
01:24:53,621 --> 01:24:56,715
Rashmi, whom you love... yes!

1278
01:24:56,791 --> 01:24:58,554
You can't even tell the truth
to the one you love!

1279
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:00,520
You know why?

1280
01:25:01,496 --> 01:25:02,724
Because you are a coward, gutless.

1281
01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:05,958
Shameful.

1282
01:25:09,370 --> 01:25:10,769
I am disappointed.

1283
01:25:11,573 --> 01:25:13,507
I am ashamed of both of you

1284
01:25:13,575 --> 01:25:14,906
- But sir...
- I don't want to hear anything!

1285
01:25:14,976 --> 01:25:16,773
Just leave me and get lost!

1286
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:19,814
You have hurt my faith, get lost!

1287
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:54,714
- Rashmi.
- Don't touch me!

1288
01:25:56,351 --> 01:25:58,444
Rashmi, I know you
are angry with me.

1289
01:25:58,519 --> 01:26:00,851
I know that I have made
a mistake, I have lied.

1290
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:04,415
But if I have lied, then
you have lied to me too.

1291
01:26:05,293 --> 01:26:07,386
By hiding that you are principle
Awasthi's daughter.

1292
01:26:08,796 --> 01:26:10,593
There is a limit of
being shameless Raju.

1293
01:26:11,799 --> 01:26:16,896
But it's obvious, that you
don't know that limit.

1294
01:26:18,506 --> 01:26:20,235
Whether papa forgives you or not...

1295
01:26:20,308 --> 01:26:22,902
...I can never forgive you.

1296
01:26:22,977 --> 01:26:25,241
Do you love me or my percentage?

1297
01:26:25,313 --> 01:26:29,682
The one I used to love,
I didn't know him.

1298
01:26:31,419 --> 01:26:35,185
But today the one I hate, he
is a hundred percent liar...

1299
01:26:35,256 --> 01:26:38,248
...and a selfish person.

1300
01:26:39,494 --> 01:26:44,864
Okay, today this selfish man will
go away from your life forever.

1301
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:50,202
But remember one thing,
whatever I did...

1302
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:55,937
...I did it because, I have
always loved you 100%.

1303
01:27:07,455 --> 01:27:09,218
Sir, two boys that you have chosen...

1304
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:10,814
...they are completely useless.

1305
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:12,655
They will surely fail.

1306
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:14,922
Instead of them, send
Rambo and Rashmi.

1307
01:27:15,363 --> 01:27:17,661
No, send both of them.

1308
01:27:18,366 --> 01:27:20,357
Let them learn their own lesson.

1309
01:27:20,435 --> 01:27:22,232
They have brought this situation
upon themselves...

1310
01:27:22,303 --> 01:27:23,634
...let them face the consequences.

1311
01:27:25,506 --> 01:27:26,734
Quiz.

1312
01:27:29,444 --> 01:27:31,571
Okay, I will ask you
the first question.

1313
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:34,238
Who is the most insane person?

1314
01:27:35,683 --> 01:27:42,452
You have four options A, you
who is going to take part.

1315
01:27:44,859 --> 01:27:48,522
B, me because I am listening
to such foolish things.

1316
01:27:48,596 --> 01:27:52,259
- C, that principle who is sending you there.
- Papa, please.

1317
01:27:52,333 --> 01:27:53,698
Just a minute.

1318
01:27:55,937 --> 01:28:00,431
And D, the people who are
organizing this quiz competition.

1319
01:28:12,553 --> 01:28:14,817
Your son is a total loss
in dance, a total loss.

1320
01:28:15,356 --> 01:28:17,950
- In dance, I am...
- Please don't talk like that.

1321
01:28:18,026 --> 01:28:19,584
Then what else shall I do,
what else shall I do?

1322
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:21,628
He wants to take part
in a dance competition.

1323
01:28:21,696 --> 01:28:23,288
If a lizard enters his pants then,
he will dance like this.

1324
01:28:23,364 --> 01:28:24,831
Like this.

1325
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:28,733
Oh Lord, this Prabhu Deva had
to take birth in this house.

1326
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:31,397
You never even danced
in Ganpati or Dandia.

1327
01:28:31,472 --> 01:28:32,564
At least my child is trying.

1328
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:33,902
He is trying.

1329
01:28:34,242 --> 01:28:36,233
You wanted a son like me,
now that I am trying...

1330
01:28:36,310 --> 01:28:37,743
You are trying...

1331
01:28:51,592 --> 01:28:52,786
You hurt him, didn't you.

1332
01:28:54,929 --> 01:28:58,729
Okay, if we are destined
to win, then we will win.

1333
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,631
But we will not lose
hope till the last.

1334
01:29:02,737 --> 01:29:05,331
I say that you can win
this dance competition.

1335
01:29:05,406 --> 01:29:07,271
You know, you once told me that
recognize your abilities...

1336
01:29:07,341 --> 01:29:08,933
...understand your weakness...

1337
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:10,910
...and just go for it
with your willpower.

1338
01:29:11,612 --> 01:29:14,274
I know Dinky, but practically
I don't have much time...

1339
01:29:14,348 --> 01:29:17,283
- ...and in so less time we...
- Look, for the next 10 days...

1340
01:29:17,351 --> 01:29:21,811
...I will make you do dance
rehearsals continuously.

1341
01:29:22,423 --> 01:29:24,653
And I believe that you can do it.

1342
01:29:26,527 --> 01:29:28,722
We don't have any other
way then trying.

1343
01:29:29,363 --> 01:29:30,660
Let's do it Raju.

1344
01:29:31,899 --> 01:29:34,231
This is a game of life and
death, let's play it.

1345
01:29:34,302 --> 01:29:35,428
Let's do it.

1346
01:30:04,832 --> 01:30:07,266
I will turn this youth festival
in such an event...

1347
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:09,929
...that Awasthi and his
pupil will remember it.

1348
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:18,777
The sorrows of my heart.

1349
01:30:21,349 --> 01:30:25,376
The sorrows of my mind.

1350
01:30:26,621 --> 01:30:31,854
The sorrows of my desires.

1351
01:30:34,362 --> 01:30:37,729
I want to tell you.

1352
01:30:41,569 --> 01:30:44,902
I want to tell you.

1353
01:30:46,874 --> 01:30:50,366
I want to tell you.

1354
01:30:54,315 --> 01:30:56,783
Welcome to inter-collegiate
youth festival.

1355
01:30:56,851 --> 01:31:00,412
The next competition is music
and dance competition.

1356
01:31:08,896 --> 01:31:11,262
We don't want to say anything
about the current condition...

1357
01:31:11,332 --> 01:31:13,266
...of our college, whatever
you want to ask...

1358
01:31:13,334 --> 01:31:15,393
...you can ask Dr. Awasthi.

1359
01:31:15,469 --> 01:31:17,266
And the courage that our children
have shown today...

1360
01:31:17,338 --> 01:31:20,933
...that proves that, they are
worthy of this competition.

1361
01:31:21,609 --> 01:31:24,772
Enough, enough, enough, thank
you, thank you, thank you.

1362
01:31:25,813 --> 01:31:29,214
And now comes the turn on,
from BSS college...

1363
01:31:29,283 --> 01:31:31,376
...Mr. Raju Malhotra.

1364
01:31:33,854 --> 01:31:40,384
No one knows when this
pain will stop.

1365
01:31:40,461 --> 01:31:47,629
My insanity says, I ask only
for you in my every prayer.

1366
01:31:47,702 --> 01:31:51,399
My day does not conclude
without seeing you.

1367
01:31:51,472 --> 01:31:53,303
My day does not conclude.

1368
01:31:53,374 --> 01:31:56,639
I don't have any control
on my desires anymore.

1369
01:31:56,711 --> 01:31:58,508
I don't have any control

1370
01:31:58,579 --> 01:32:03,380
The sorrows of my heart.

1371
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:08,780
The sorrows of my mind.

1372
01:32:10,324 --> 01:32:14,488
The sorrows of my desires.

1373
01:32:17,832 --> 01:32:21,393
I want to tell you.

1374
01:32:22,937 --> 01:32:26,429
I want to tell you.

1375
01:32:47,361 --> 01:32:48,692
Hurray! Hurray!

1376
01:32:49,497 --> 01:32:50,657
Hurray! Hurray!

1377
01:32:51,365 --> 01:32:52,559
Hip, Hip Hurray!

1378
01:32:53,367 --> 01:32:54,459
Hurray! Hurray!

1379
01:32:54,535 --> 01:32:56,298
Hip, Hip Hurray!

1380
01:33:06,514 --> 01:33:10,575
The sorrows of my heart.

1381
01:33:11,719 --> 01:33:15,849
The sorrows of my mind.

1382
01:33:16,891 --> 01:33:21,760
The sorrows of my desires.

1383
01:33:24,865 --> 01:33:28,426
I want to tell you.

1384
01:33:30,404 --> 01:33:34,363
I want to tell you.

1385
01:33:35,776 --> 01:33:39,473
I want to tell you.

1386
01:33:40,348 --> 01:33:43,408
And the winner is Raju Malhotra.

1387
01:33:59,233 --> 01:34:00,393
I won!

1388
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:01,526

...Bharat Bhagya Vidhata'.

1472
01:39:58,726 --> 01:40:02,560
What is the meaning of 'Bharat
Bhagya Vidhata'?

1473
01:40:04,932 --> 01:40:07,457
You can give the answer
by keeping seated too.

1474
01:40:07,534 --> 01:40:10,833
Sir I have stood up for the
national anthem and not for you.

1475
01:40:15,409 --> 01:40:17,570
Sir, it means the constructer
of the fate of India.

1476
01:40:17,644 --> 01:40:20,477
Wonderful answer, wonderful answer.

1479
01:40:27,287 --> 01:40:29,619
...and BSS college are on a tie.

1482

...discover the third law of motion?

1483
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:54,911
Listen to the question carefully.

1484
01:40:55,315 --> 01:40:57,249
In which year did Alfred Einstein...

1485
01:40:57,317 --> 01:40:59,444

1492
01:41:25,813 --> 01:41:28,941
It's a tie breaker question,
go for it guys.

1493
01:41:31,351 --> 01:41:32,545
BSS college.

BSS college your time
is running out.

1500
01:42:28,275 --> 01:42:32,712
A it is Newton, and
B not attraction.

1501
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:37,216
Sir, this is a trick question,
the law of motion...

1502
01:42:37,284 --> 01:42:40,378
...was discovered by Newton
and not Einstein.

1503
01:42:48,362 --> 01:42:50,227
That was a tie breaking answer
to the tie breaking question...

1504
01:42:50,297 --> 01:42:51,958
...and the answer is correct.

1505
01:43:02,376 --> 01:43:04,640
Yeah!

1506
01:43:08,715 --> 01:43:09,841
Yes!

1507
01:43:11,318 --> 01:43:12,546
Yeah!

1508
01:43:18,592 --> 01:43:20,253
And with that, the winner of
today's quiz contest is...

1509
01:43:20,327 --> 01:43:22,852
...BSS college's Mr. Rajan Malhotra.

1510
01:43:28,602 --> 01:43:32,197
And the champions trophy of the
inter-college youth festival...

1511
01:43:32,272 --> 01:43:34,672
...goes to BSS college.

1512
01:43:50,223 --> 01:43:51,417
We have done it.

1513
01:44:02,302 --> 01:44:08,707
We have deceived and lied to all
of you to win this trophy.

1514
01:44:13,380 --> 01:44:14,711
You know it all sir, don't you.

1515
01:44:16,316 --> 01:44:18,409
I am Raju and he is Rajan.

1516
01:44:19,820 --> 01:44:23,586
Yes, with the mix up in the
college our sections changed.

1517
01:44:24,324 --> 01:44:26,588
Our names and our deeds changed.

1518
01:44:27,828 --> 01:44:29,193
And when did we start changing...

1519
01:44:29,262 --> 01:44:31,355
...we never realized that.

1520
01:44:32,666 --> 01:44:37,194
The truth is that, neither us
nor our parents believed that...

1521
01:44:37,270 --> 01:44:39,864
...we are capable of it.

1522
01:44:43,744 --> 01:44:48,408
But we can do something, we
can change and we can win.

1523
01:44:50,817 --> 01:44:54,810
Only one person believed that,
just one person.

1524
01:44:55,355 --> 01:44:59,223
Our principle Mr. Awasthi,
who supported us...

1525
01:44:59,292 --> 01:45:02,523
...and then challenged us.

1526
01:45:02,596 --> 01:45:04,894
Thank you Awasthi sir, thank you.

1527
01:45:04,965 --> 01:45:06,626
That you gave us this challenge.

1528
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:11,296
If you want you can rusticate
us from this college.

1529
01:45:14,841 --> 01:45:16,741
Because now we attained
our trophies.

1530
01:45:17,711 --> 01:45:21,977
We can see out victory, in
the eyes of our parents.

1531
01:45:26,787 --> 01:45:28,550
In the tears of joy of my sister.

1532
01:45:33,794 --> 01:45:35,318
In Mr. Awasthi's faith.

1533
01:46:16,303 --> 01:46:21,400
Friends, there is a Raju
and a Rajan in all of us.

1534
01:46:22,309 --> 01:46:24,368
There is nothing like
good boy or bad boy.

1535
01:46:24,444 --> 01:46:28,175
They are all smart boys, all
colleges should not have...

1536
01:46:28,248 --> 01:46:31,183
...such brass and copper trophies...

1537
01:46:31,251 --> 01:46:34,778
...but such live trophies.

1538
01:46:35,655 --> 01:46:37,179
Like the ones that I have.

1539
01:46:38,325 --> 01:46:40,885
And not just one, but two
like the ones that I have.

1540
01:47:30,844 --> 01:47:34,541
My profligacy. My craziness.

1541
01:47:34,614 --> 01:47:38,710
Will find peace, beloved.

1542
01:47:46,393 --> 01:47:49,794
My profligacy. My craziness.

1543
01:47:49,863 --> 01:47:53,765
Will feel peaceful, beloved.

1544
01:47:53,833 --> 01:47:59,772
If you will hold me,
I will not stagger.

1545
01:48:01,274 --> 01:48:07,736
If you will hold me,
I will not stagger.

1546
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:43,881
There is intoxication
and loneliness.

1547
01:48:43,950 --> 01:48:47,750
There is fervor.

1548
01:48:47,821 --> 01:48:55,387
Dawn and dusk. All the
time I remember you.

1549
01:48:55,462 --> 01:48:58,454
Don't go. Don't go in this state.

1550
01:48:58,531 --> 01:49:01,591
Dwell me in your eyes.

1551
01:49:01,668 --> 01:49:03,863
Come. Come.

1552
01:49:03,937 --> 01:49:06,838
Beloved, hide me.

1553
01:49:06,906 --> 01:49:10,535
My love. My craziness.

1554
01:49:10,610 --> 01:49:14,478
Will find peace, beloved.

1555
01:49:14,547 --> 01:49:20,679
