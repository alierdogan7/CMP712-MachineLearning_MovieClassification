I have to make a palace of dolls
for my daughter-

24
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,952
Today itself

25
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,951
Doctor, I have to get the plaster
tied on my hand

26
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,165
Doctor, Make it fast

00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:07,689
Shut up

29
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:12,597
You talk too much, Keshav.

30
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,764

Daughter, Seema daughter that man,

35
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:24,103
I regret, to remove
your plaster again

36
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:35,485
But now, this plaster will be
removed only after my Lawyer comes

37
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,416
Sir, again, but only today
in the morning

38
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:38,854
What ever I say, only do that

39
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,184
I am Jagmohan Lal Jugran speaking

40
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:43,386
What, Mr.Jugran?

41
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,121
Yes, Jagmohan Lal Jugran speaking

42
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:46,827
I need to speak with
Advocate Mehta

43
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,024
Go and call those two officers
who were present here in the morning

44
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,341
Mr. S.P I am not
Jagmohan Lal Jugran -

45
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,918
I am his twin brother
Manmohan Lal

46
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,314
Sir, this man is speaking shit

47
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,588
He is the same man, Jugran

48
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,055
I have told you
several times that -

49
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,425
Okay, find it out from
Bangalore, where we used to stay-

50
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,957
Where we spent our childhood

51
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,288
From the school, college,
from our relatives

52
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:19,897
From our neighbours residing
over there ask them, that I am

53
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:21,897
Jugran's twin brother
Manmohan Lal

54
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:23,493
Sir, This man is telling right

55
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,995
The information we asked from
the Bangalore police about him -

56
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:26,933
Here is the report

57
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,596
They told you,
told you, that l....-

58
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,571
One minute, one minute,
Sir, they have also confirmed on this-

59
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,610
That, there is a twin brother of his
who is just like him-

60
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:33,674
And whose records hold, no good

61
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:34,143
Did you see?

62
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:39,148
We are sorry Mr. Manmohan Lal
you got troubled -

63
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,480
But,regarding your brother-

64
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:42,951
Even, if you get a slightest
of information, then....

65
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,022
How are you my brother?

66
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,167
Get lost from here, get lost

67
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:06,742
What happened, brother?

68
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,076
I feel ashamed
calling you my brother

69
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,144
Actually calling an ldiot
man like you, to be my brother-

70
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,043
Even I don't feel very happy

71
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,948
Be afraid of God, Jagmohan

72
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:21,226
You be afraid of God
because you are his devotee

73
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,094
I am the worshipper of devil

74
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:26,996
I swear by the devil

75
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,593
If I knew that I would
meet you like this,-

76
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,368
I wouldn't have come at all

77
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,540
But, now that I have come
be Hospitable

78
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,768
Can you make arrangements
for some food

79
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,105
I'll bring

80
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,319
Inspector Pathak, I am
Manmohan Lal

81
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,217
You immediately come
to my house

82
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:03,163
Manmohan Lal now, I am
going to kill you

83
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:04,701
By killing me,
you cannot eacape-

84
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,302
The police will come here
any moment

85
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:07,370
You cannot escape

86
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,471
I have no intentions
of escaping either-

87
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,274
But here, the police will not
find me -

88
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,771
Instead they'll find
only you, you

89
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:20,007
To refer, Manmohan Lal will not
be you, It will be myself

90
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:21,016
Rascal

91
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,555
Manmohan this was the only Resort
for me to escape from the police

92
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,022
I swear by the Devil, from today
I am only-

93
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,257
Manmohan, and
I am only Jugran

94
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,481
So, the police believed me,
to be Manmohan Lal

95
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,151
Sir, this work was
perfectly alright

96
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:59,115
But, that customs officer was
clever, more than he required to be

97
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:03,059
I swear by the Devil,
such a clever man-

98
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,787
Should not be alive
for a long time

99
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,898
Very good my son
You are grown up-

100
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,039
You have started travelling
even without mother and father

101
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,409
Daddy, there mother made me to sit,
here you have taken me down

102
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:23,081
But Daddy, when will
Mummy, Ravi and Kusum come?

103
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:24,179
After two days

104
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:27,116
Stop the Car there,
where he would be able to see me-

105
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,511
I want that he should
come behind me

106
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,120
Son, you sit down here, I'll
just come, don't go away from here

107
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,541
Mrs. Verma, at that time of the
untoward event-

108
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:35,543
When the police reached

109
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,006
Mr. Verma was alive,-

110
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,979
He only told us that the killer
is none other than Jugran

111
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:46,520
Who ever it is,
my life has got ruined

112
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,928
Now, I should only
get my son, Ramesh back

113
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,094
I don't know where he would be?

114
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:01,933
When a string brokes
its pearls get scattered where all-

115
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:05,403
"BAL BHAVAN" an Orphanage

116
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:10,145
Uninformed of his father's death
seperated from his family

117
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:13,183
Life had brought Ramesh here-

118
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:18,414
And here he got those remembrances
which he could never forget

119
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:26,122
He met Simi, the same girl
whose father Dr. Ashok soni's murder-

120
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,692
Was done by Jugran

121
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:31,829
Father's death, and after her
mother loosing her senses-

122
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:36,434
Yesterday's darling daughter
was today in an Orphanage

123
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,170
Simi was dejected
Ramesh was alone

124
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,472
In the times of their sorrow

125
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:47,946
Their friendship started growing
like creeper's of flowers

126
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,049
Will you eat this?

127
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,584
I don't like

128
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,557
Do you know, what will I do
when I grow up?

129
00:14:56,262 --> 00:15:00,892
Along with you, the man who
killed your father, I'll kill him

130
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:01,622
Why?

131
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:05,803
Because you are my friend but you
never laugh, why don't you laugh?

132
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,569
Because, I don't like anything

133
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,366
I find everything bad

134
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,444
Okay, I'll tell you a tale,-

135
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,546
You tell me whether
it happened good or bad?

136
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:21,279
One day, A robber entered
a man's house, good or bad

137
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:22,651
Bad

138
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,718
But there was nothing in
the house that could be robbed

139
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,323
Good

140
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,224
After this the robber
got furious,-

141
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,395
Taking a big stick
he went to his bed

142
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:31,425
He hit him one hard

143
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,654
Bad

144
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,730
But the man was not
sleeping on the bead

145
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,458
Good

146
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:39,229
And, further what happened,
I forgot

147
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,867
Bad

148
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,004
But you got a laugh

149
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:44,667
Good

150
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,846
Look Simi, they are your
new aunty & uncle

151
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,955
And from now you'll not
stay in this Orphanage

152
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:36,721
You'll stay with them

153
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,819
I am leaving

154
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,036
So what, we'll meet again

155
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:30,311
Do you remeber,
you made a promise to me-

156
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,850
That the man who killed my father
you will.....

157
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,020
Do you remember?

158
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:39,753
I remember

159
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:14,523
After Simi had left, Ramesh was
not happy at the Orphanage

160
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,722
And with the desire
of meeting Simi-

161
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,992
One night he ran away
from "Bal Bhavan"

162
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:51,185
Are you in a hurry. My dear son
what's the story?

163
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:56,190
I..... I.... Iost my way

164
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:03,667
No problem, my dear son
I'll show you the right way

165
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:08,970
Wicked Girdharilal took innocent
Ramesh to a path of robbery-

166
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:15,011
And the changing times made
Ramesh a safe breaker thief

167
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:09,734
Girdhari Boss, take care of this

168
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:15,065
My dear son,
everything is ready inside

169
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,520
Have you kept the diamonds safe?

170
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:39,493
Its perfectly safe, you don't worry

171
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:43,959
Still 10 minutes are more
Mr. Katiklal

172
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:47,664
Ay what are you doing?

173
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:55,839
But instead, it was good.

174
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:58,339
Once more

175
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,776
No It's my mistake

176
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,181
No it's our mistake
No, No our mistake

177
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:04,219
No, it is only my mistake,-

178
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:08,593
I was walking somewhere,
and seeing somewhere

179
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:14,031
Madam, you may be seeing anywhere
But, we should have looked at you

180
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:24,699
She looks like a loose character
should we take her Tel:No

181
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:27,337
Is this your brief-case?

182
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:31,446
Don't know how it fell down?

183
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,048
Should I tell how it fell?

184
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,511
Like this

185
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:37,983
You are joking

186
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:58,632
Should we go back of her?

187
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:01,643
Sir, Mr. Narang..... come....

188
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,606
Then come

189
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:05,614
Oh! I stopped there because of you
otherwise...

190
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:18,022
Sorry, Narang
we got late

191
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:19,225
Have you brought
the diamonds?

192
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:25,596
See this, such diamonds
you will not get anywhere

193
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,396
They are of a very good quality

194
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:29,437
Yes, look, how they are glittering

195
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,777
Tonny, put the crown of
diamonds on their head

196
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:48,753
Okay, Seema, after these diamonds
are sold, you'll get your money

197
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,457
And, you'll get your commission

198
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:55,121
Okay, Pinto, call me up if there is
some other similar work

199
00:28:55,834 --> 00:29:00,032
Seema, tell me one thing,
a beautiful girl like you-

200
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:02,967
In such a dangerous profession
why?

201
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:09,075
Pinto, If you are in search
of a drunkard -

202
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:11,205
Where will you find him?

203
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:12,245
In a Tavern

204
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:16,483
And a gambler

205
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:17,780
In a gambling house

206
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:26,653
I am, in search of a
diamonds smuggler

207
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:29,663
Who is he?

208
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:33,896
This is what I want to know

209
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:37,635
So, you are searching him,
whom you even don't know, why?

210
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:51,355
Why?

211
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:57,826
The answer for this "Why?" one day
I'll only give it to him

212
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:04,557
Greetings Mr. Manmohan Lal

213
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:07,466
Tell me, how can I help you?

214
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:08,832
Sir, he is Dr. Mishra

215
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:12,642
Mr. Manmohan Lal, we are running
a hospital for children

216
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:15,337
We thought, If another
ward could be set up then....

217
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,547
Enough, enough, you don't have to
take pains of saying anything more

218
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:21,048
Bihari, whatever amount of cheque
Mr. Mishra wants, give it to him

219
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,148
Great, how much do you do
for the afflicted people

220
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,389
May be, because of these
afflicted people

221
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:28,286
God has give me so much

222
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,456
Otherwise, where am l?
and where this wealth

223
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:34,497
Sir, phone, lts an
important call

224
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:38,533
Sir, Mr. Donze wants to
meet you in the evening

225
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:39,395
Okay, Okay.

226
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:44,504
Sir, one more thing, Kirti who had
taken our diamonds, has come back

227
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:45,875
Now, he is here

228
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:47,135
Okay, I'll come

229
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:52,442
Okay, I'll leave,
It's time for my worship, Greetings

230
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:53,345
Thank you.

231
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:40,890
When did you come?

232
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,397
Mr. Jugran, I returned,
from Europe only today

233
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:46,000
I have handed over your
diamonds to your man Victor

234
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,775
If an improbity is commited with
hard work, devotion and intelligence-

235
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,209
The world's entire honest
people can do nothing-

236
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,380
To such a dis-honest person

237
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,684
Balwant, This man Kirti is of
great importance to us-

238
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,593
He took with him diamonds worth
crores, and went out of country-

239
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,153
But, the police
could not catch him

240
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:26,805
I swear by the Devil

241
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:34,980
I cheat people
people don't cheat me

242
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:43,658
Rascal, you went there and kept
glass pieces instead of diamonds

243
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:46,358
Take him away

244
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:58,608
No, Mr. Jugran
forgive me, forgive me

245
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,871
I'll not commit
such a mistake again

246
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:47,558
Come, Mr. Donze, we were only
waiting for you

247
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:49,192
Come

248
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:51,057
Mr. Donze

249
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:54,391
Till today I have done many
transactions of diamonds with you-

250
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:58,569
But today, today I am going
to give you such an offer-

251
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,763
Which will be the biggest
offer of your life time

252
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,901
5 crores

253
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:05,776
10 crores

254
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:07,441
50 crores

255
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:12,913
100 crores

256
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,515
100 crores.......

257
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:23,583
But, where will we get diamonds
worth 100 crores at a time?

258
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,428
Have you heard of the name
"Kohinoor Diamond Corporation"

259
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:31,966
Every month, a train takes
diamonds worth 100 crores

260
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:33,330
From there to the airport -

261
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:41,076
And this train, for 15 minutes
passes through a desolated area

262
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:48,913
But, the diamonds in that safe
cannot be robbed even in 15 hours

263
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:53,957
Mr. Donze, you don't
know about this country

264
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,326
If searched, I swear by the devil -

265
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:59,827
There are experts
scattered all over

266
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,027
My dear son

267
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,900
Oh! Mr. Girdhari Lal
what's the news?

268
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:10,374
Where are you, what's the story?

269
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,736
Girdhari Boss, come to the point

270
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:16,069
Have you heard of the name
queen Yashodhra Devi

271
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:20,511
But, what will I do going to
queen Yashodhra Devi's party

272
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:23,082
Try to understand,
my beautiful

273
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:25,981
The Necklace that queen
Yashodhra Devi would be wearing-

274
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,517
It's every diamond
would be priceless

275
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,089
Are you sure she would be
wearing that necklace

276
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,628
Definitely my dear son
definitely

277
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:38,031
Then, think that necklace
has become ours

278
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:41,599
Girdhari Boss flicking Yashodhra Devi's
necklace will be my victory-

279
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,537
Apart from this nothing else
can be done, who'll stop me?

280
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:00,889
Come, Ravi come

281
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:04,752
You know, that I consider you
the best officer of my department

282
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,158
This file is of the robbers
pertaining with diamonds

283
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:10,661
From today, this case
is of your responsibility

284
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:18,837
Sir, I promise one day it would be
robbers hands and my manacles

285
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:23,442
Brother, do you know this Holy
thread is also a kind of manacle

286
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:24,904
The manacle of love

287
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:26,343
Well, this is also fine

288
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,314
Through out the year we make
the accused wear the manacles

289
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:29,476
Today, you make me wear

290
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:33,420
Son, after wearing this
fine has also to be paid

291
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:38,158
Yes, fine, ofcourse I have to pay,
have I ever forgotten, Kusum?

292
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,469
Ay, what happened?

293
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:49,668
Again, like every year

294
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,944
Every year, she deposits one Holy
thread in the name of Ramesh

295
00:36:57,081 --> 00:37:00,710
You are such a big officer,
you can come to know of anybody-

296
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:02,946
Can't you search your brother?

297
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,318
Don't cry Kusum, don't cry

298
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:11,761
Brother

299
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,430
Our blessings will definitely
bear fruit

300
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,827
We'll get our Ramesh
we'll definitely get him

301
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:29,644
Ay brother, where have you come from?

302
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,478
Son Jango, It's clearly stated
on the card

303
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,052
"Entry for one person only"

304
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:40,881
You do onething,
you go, understood

305
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:44,752
I'll go and clear the neck
of Mrs. Yashodhra Devi

306
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,735
Hallo Mr. Batliwala, how are you?
you are alone -

307
00:37:58,876 --> 00:37:59,137
Yes

308
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:01,402
Where is your best friend
Mr. Topiwala?

309
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:08,477
I heard the responsibility of
catching that famous Jewel thief -

310
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:09,818
Is on your head

311
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,353
You Press people
are simply great

312
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:25,696
One should not hear
any one's talk-

313
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,894
But this talk walked itself
into my ears -

314
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:29,896
That you are a police officer

315
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:34,871
And, I have also heard Mr. Ravi,
that now-a-day's the diamond robber-

316
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:38,174
Who has created an uproar
you are intended to catch him

317
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,283
Absolutely right

318
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:43,151
One day, it would be robbers
hands, and my manacles

319
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:26,920
My necklace till now, it was
in my neck, where is my necklace

320
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,115
My necklace

321
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,324
Keshav, the necklace is stolen

322
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:51,141
In this party, a precious
diamond necklace of Yashodhra Devi-

323
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:52,077
Is missing

324
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:55,478
Who ever is present here
will not be permitted to leave

325
00:45:57,221 --> 00:45:59,621
Oh, I am sorry, my leg....

326
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:02,992
You, sing very good

327
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:10,922
I regret for it, but this is the
question of our hotel's reputation

328
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:13,830
I feel ticklish

329
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:15,160
You may go

330
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:24,476
This way please, ladies that side

331
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:00,312
Friend, you helped me
at the right time

332
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:03,780
Otherwise, today these diamonds
and this Hero -

333
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:05,047
Both, would have been
in the police station

334
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:23,161
His name was Jango and yours?

335
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:29,277
The name is something else
with love, people call me Romeo

336
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:32,706
Even, you can call me Romeo
but, with love

337
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:39,384
Romeo, this necklace was brought
out of the hall by you -

338
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:42,156
But, I had removed it
from the neck

339
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:46,658
No, Not at all

340
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:50,857
Look, if you don't want that,-

341
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,231
I should be at the back of you
like a shadow-

342
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:59,435
Make your living difficult
I spoil all your work

343
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:03,135
So, 50 - 50, Okay

344
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:08,951
Madam, this is very strange
actually its called a thumb

345
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:13,455
But, if it is shown like this
its called Balls

346
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:22,090
Great, great, great

347
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:23,264
Here, strike it

348
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:27,633
My dear son, tell me one thing
you'll give me the necklace-

349
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:30,235
After selling it
I'll give you, your share-

350
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:33,943
And, like everytime, you'll give
your share to the Orphanage-

351
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:37,475
After so much, of hard work
what did you have for yourself?

352
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:40,274
Girdhari Boss, in life,
I have lost so much-

353
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:41,814
That to gain something,
has never interested me

354
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:45,416
One day in the same city,
amidst the croud-

355
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:49,320
A child's hand was separated
from his father

356
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,454
Then, everything got lost-

357
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:55,693
Mother, father,
brother, sister everything-

358
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:58,493
Even, If I get them today,-

359
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:02,236
I'll immediately abandon the,
world of crime, at this moment

360
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:08,142
Girdhari Boss, people loose
their keys, of their lock-

361
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:13,382
And I am one, who has lost
the lock, of the key

362
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:29,361
Who called me?

363
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:35,234
You remembered me, sir

364
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,128
Yes

365
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:42,603
You remembered me, and
Sub-inspector Rangbirangey lal Chauhan-

366
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,540
Is at your service

367
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,881
So today, Rajkumar, you are having
the fever of filmstar Rajkumar

368
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,245
What to do Sir, -

369
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:54,180
When ever I watch a movie
of a particular filmstar-

370
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:57,018
Then, 24 hours, I am
intoxicated about him-

371
00:49:57,928 --> 00:50:00,396
Now, 12 hours of it
are passed my dear-

372
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:05,726
Sir, still 12 hours of it
are remaining, 12 hours

373
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:07,564
Have you seen the
Nihal Singh murder case file?

374
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,407
Nihal sing's file

375
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,744
File.....

376
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:30,620
The condition of the file
tells that this case is-

377
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:34,962
Very much dangerous
amd very complicated

378
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:36,764
Very complicated

379
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:39,359
Do one thing, take the file
from my table -

380
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:40,525
And give it to S.P's office

381
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:45,270
One more file, alright

382
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:51,770
My dear, by looks you
look like a star-

383
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:53,973
But, you do the work
of a paper-weight -

384
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,246
By the way, who are you?

385
00:50:58,588 --> 00:50:59,486
Sir, lock

386
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:04,627
This is that lock,
The key of which has got lost

387
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:24,977
Daddy, daddy you were telling
that you have such a lock-

388
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:26,774
That no one else in
the world has it

389
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,276
Daddy, show it to us

390
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:30,543
Do you want to see the lock
this is the lock-

391
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:36,320
This lock is for Ravi,
and the key is for Ramesh

392
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:39,086
But, remember one thing
both this lock and key

393
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:41,527
Without one another
is totally useless-

394
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:43,560
If you have to use it,-

395
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:46,803
Then, forever you'll both
have to stay together

396
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:21,162
Ay, Is your name Romeo?

397
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:24,131
Why, It shouldn't have been

398
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:26,238
You give the answer
only in "Yes" or "No"

399
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:27,743
Is your name Romeo?

400
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:28,701
"Yes"

401
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:30,704
You will work for us

402
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:31,738
"No"

403
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:34,012
Do you know, we can give you a
good price for this work

404
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,045
"Yes"

405
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:36,747
Tell, what do you say?

406
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:37,810
"No"

407
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:40,312
Very funny
talk in a straight way

408
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:42,592
Well, you only told me to
give an answer in "Yes or No"

409
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:45,394
Then, we also know other
methods, of asking questions?

410
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:56,372
If the appereance is like this

411
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:57,837
Then one shouldn't have a
Gun in his hand

412
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:00,976
Instead, one should
have a begging bowl

413
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:06,540
No.., No I'll not listen
for any explanation-

414
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:09,444
You all were present there
you, you, you-

415
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:10,950
Balwant and Kashav
were also present there-

416
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:12,585
And that Romeo was
in front of you

417
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:15,153
It's a shame,
Shame on you all,-

418
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:17,826
He has made you all
bite the dust for ever

419
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:19,152
Jugran Sir, what happened was.....

420
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:22,390
You shut up, you use to brag
that you would bring him here-

421
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:23,260
Useless

422
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:37,811
Balwant, listen for the last time

423
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,481
I want Romeo

424
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:46,955
Because, a safe breaker like him-

425
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:59,362
I swear by the devil
he is very important to me

426
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:20,186
Hallo, any new Drama, Today?

427
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:22,118
Yes, absolutely new.

428
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:24,950
And, if you want that I don't
do this drama-

429
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,460
Then, that necklace which is
In your pocket-

430
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:30,294
Without doing any drama,
give it to me

431
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:33,061
My answer for the necklace is
same even today Madam,

432
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:34,166
As it was yesterday

433
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:35,504
Ball's

434
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:38,538
Alright, then I'll present
the drama,

435
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,373
"A tale of a sorrowful woman"

436
00:54:48,985 --> 00:54:49,349
Ay! what happened?

437
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:53,582
I am robbed, I am ruined.

438
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:58,361
My dear, how did you get
the heart of leaving a Girl-

439
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:00,620
Whose face is so innocent
my dear

440
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:02,195
My dear
Ay what are you doing?

441
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:03,195
My dear, My dear, My dear

442
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:07,869
Don't leave me and go like this
I beg of you

443
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:10,365
What happened sister
what happened?

444
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:11,832
Mother.....

445
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:19,506
You called me sister, Then also
listen to your sister's sad story

446
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:24,149
This Romeo, a lad of Bombay,
and me Shanta a girl from Madras.

447
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:31,252
He told me a story of a movie,
entraped me, married me-

448
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:33,056
Made me a wife,
and now, he is befooling me

449
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:34,890
She is not my wife.

450
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:41,735
Oh! My God, you say there is nothing,
There is nothing

451
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:45,572
If I am not your wife,
then the auspicious thread-

452
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:47,470
Which I am wearing, is it for me
to die by hanging with it-

453
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,736
And, the locket with your photo,

454
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,304
Did your father give it to me?

455
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:59,586
Ay brothers', mothers, he tells
me, that I am not his wife

456
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:04,787
Aren't you ashamed of troubling
your wife, son of a Gun.

457
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:12,762
He sells my Jewellery
and gambles, drinks liquor,-

458
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:17,736
Goes to brothels, watches girls
dancing, sings songs

459
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:22,073
This, this is false,
all this is false

460
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:30,142
And today, he is selling
my last, last diamond necklace

461
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:33,019
It's in his pocket

462
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:37,490
Sister's, catch hold of
his body tightly

463
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:41,119
What are you all doing?,
I don't have necklace

464
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:42,195
I don't have any......

465
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:47,803
What is this? you are a liar,
cheat and a betrayer-

466
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,205
Son of a Gun

467
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:56,976
Thank you, thank you
give me my necklace back

468
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:57,579
Take it

469
00:56:58,047 --> 00:57:03,144
Wait, sister, you have
heard her story

470
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:06,119
But now, listen to my
sorrowful story also

471
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:09,153
It is true that
she is my wife

472
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:10,754
Mother, he told, he told......

473
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:18,265
But, she is my wife only for
the necklace, not for the love

474
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:19,298
What does that mean?

475
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:23,105
Father, if I lie,
I see your dead body

476
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:23,728
What?

477
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,041
It's two years since
we are married

478
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:28,906
But, she has not given me
a kiss till date

479
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:36,116
Yes, kiss, which means
meeting of the lips

480
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:38,979
Ask her? Has she ever
given it to me

481
00:57:39,355 --> 00:57:42,449
My God, it's two years since the
marriage is over,-

482
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:44,316
And, still a kiss
has not been taken

483
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:46,854
Oye, what kind of a wife are you?

484
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:48,964
She is different, father she is different

485
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:51,765
She is not of the "KlSS" type
if she was,-

486
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:52,992
Then there wouldn't
have been any problem

487
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:55,529
Do one thing, you give
her the necklace

488
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:57,900
You give him the love
and you both become one

489
00:57:58,374 --> 00:57:59,500
From my side it's done

490
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:03,646
Ay, what non-sense
are you people talking?

491
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,542
Oye, he will now give you a kiss

492
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,443
Is it his, father's property?

493
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,547
Daughter, spit out your anger

494
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:13,015
Where do I spit?
on your face

495
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:17,185
Look Shanta forgive him

496
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:20,689
And now he'll hug me and
kiss me in front of everybody

497
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:24,092
I, l, l....mean, to you-

498
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:26,731
And with his own hands, he'll
make you wear the necklace

499
00:58:26,936 --> 00:58:28,233
Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes.......

500
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:31,340
Confusion, a lot of confusion

501
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:35,543
Go, take a kiss,
put on the necklace go, go.

502
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:37,703
Okay, first I'll
finish this work

503
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,908
I am coming shanta

504
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:44,076
I don't know you

505
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:50,758
Don't know, don't worry,
I'll tell you now who I am

506
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,392
Ay, you got a chance
don't let it go

507
00:58:58,401 --> 00:58:59,834
Sinner, wicked

508
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:18,217
You have started getting a
complex with that Romeo-

509
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:21,187
Now, he has started coming
in your dreams-

510
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:22,947
And is giving you nightmares

511
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:25,255
Now listen to what I say-

512
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:27,923
Search the man who
gives you nightmares,-

513
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:31,196
And make him your
slave, slave

514
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:35,165
Girdhari Boss, why was l
asked to come here?

515
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:37,763
My dear son,
Are you seeing this?-

516
00:59:38,775 --> 00:59:44,077
This statue is identical to the
2000 years old statue of Egypt

517
00:59:44,547 --> 00:59:46,310
Its cost is only Rs.300

518
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:49,584
But, there is no approximation
for the cost of the original statue

519
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:50,708
Then, What's the story?

520
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:54,449
The story is that my dear son
the original statue

521
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:59,260
Is with Egypt's millionare
Abu Aslam Ghanvi-

522
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:03,527

and this evening he is going to-

523
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,931
Display the original statue
to a few people

524
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:09,596
I'll make you reach there

525
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:12,902
Take this along with you

526
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:13,971
That means

527
01:00:14,711 --> 01:00:16,906
Keeping the duplicate,
I take away the original one

528
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:18,741
Correct, my dear son

529
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,610

all the arrangements

530
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:28,087
Exactly by 8 O' clock, for 1 minute
lights will get switched off

531
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:29,657

534
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:43,572
Ghanvi

535
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:16,861
Dhongri Batala, Dhongri Batala

536
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:19,731
Dhongri Batala

537
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:21,900
This is the salute
of Matunga Country

538
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:25,339
Prince you will not believe
that Matunga is a country-

539
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:26,675
Only today I came
to know of it

540
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:29,417
Come prince, I'll introduce
you to other guests

541
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:39,785

Chinch pokli......

546
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:55,936
This country is pasted between
China, Chilly & Cherapunji-

547
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:57,273
Only today I came
to know of it

548
01:01:57,447 --> 01:01:59,938
Silver spoon, silver spoon

549
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:03,584
Silver spoon, this is the
statue of Chinch pokli

Thenga

552
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:12,454
Prince says, great, great, great
he liked the salute

553
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:20,566
Mr. Abu Aslam Ghanvi's
party, is at which floor

554
01:02:20,703 --> 01:02:21,465
At the 20th floor

555
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:25,863
Princes, this statue of our
country is famous world wide-

556
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:27,805
But, what is famous
of your Chinch pokli?

557
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:33,275
Magic

558
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,050
Magic, what magic?

559
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:38,181
This statue will be Chikmanglu

560
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:39,350
Chikmanglu

561
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:40,983
"Missing"

562
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:36,290
Can I take away this statue?

563
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:37,653
Oh sure, But why?

564
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:38,953
For the magic

565
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:01,476
You, have thrown down my
world famous statue

566
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:05,220
Not thrown, only magic

567
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:07,319
But, in the magic the thing
which gets disappeared-

568
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:10,289
It also comes back
but, you have thrown it away

569
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:11,721
Not thrown

570
01:07:12,094 --> 01:07:14,119
Not thrown, then where is it?

571
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:19,992
Here it is

572
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:31,238
Did you see, not thrown away
only magic

573
01:07:32,014 --> 01:07:35,040
Great, great, great.

574
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:41,381
Magic is also done like this,
only today I came to know of it

575
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:47,056
Donghribadala, Donghribadala

576
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:49,990
Silver spoon, Silver spoon

577
01:07:53,502 --> 01:07:54,526
Silver spoon.......

578
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:58,706
I was so much engrossed in the
work for the last few days-

579
01:07:58,908 --> 01:07:59,966
That I couldn't come

580
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:03,245
When you come, It feels good
keep coming

581
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:04,774
What's the use of coming?

582
01:08:05,014 --> 01:08:06,982
Your daughter didn't even
offer me a cup of tea

583
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:10,085
Seema, I'll just bring

584
01:08:10,352 --> 01:08:12,479
Mummy, Mummy even I'll have
tea along with Seema Aunty

585
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:17,583
Seema, did you come
to know anything

586
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:20,521
If I come to know anything
or if I doubt anybody-

587
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:22,997
I'll only come
to you "D" uncle-

588
01:08:23,532 --> 01:08:27,161
You are the only one, who can
recognize the killer

589
01:08:31,974 --> 01:08:33,100
Is Doctor Ashok Soni there?

590
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:37,674
Yes, How can l
forget that face

591
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:40,506
Mr. Manmohan Lal has come....

592
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:41,883
Come Mr. Manmohan Lal

593
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:47,287
Why all this? This is
necessary only for big people

594
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:49,891
For us, you are
the biggest person

595
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:52,525
This library is established
only because of your help

596
01:08:52,728 --> 01:08:54,218
The inauguration should also
be done by you

597
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:54,691
Come

598
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:55,797
Please come....

599
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:05,434
What I mean is, that
in this business -

600
01:09:05,574 --> 01:09:06,836
There is no harm
in investing money

601
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:08,873
If we wouldn't have
met that Girlie....

602
01:09:09,078 --> 01:09:11,046
Profits were in diamonds too
did you understand-

603
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:13,078
But, what did we get?
she befooled us and went away

604
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:20,313
Seema, here is the
Price for the statue

605
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:32,294
You

606
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:33,298
You Girlie....

607
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:38,068
Catch her, catch her, catch her......

608
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:55,914
We are all thankful to you

609
01:09:56,492 --> 01:09:58,255
Thank you, Thank you, Greetings

610
01:10:07,803 --> 01:10:08,735
Driver, stop the Car

611
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:13,367
Who are you?

612
01:10:13,776 --> 01:10:16,142
Sir please, my life is in danger

613
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:18,636
Those people are following me

614
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,210
Have you seen any girl?

615
01:10:22,318 --> 01:10:22,909
Sir, we haven't seen

616
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:31,086
Seema, who were those people
who were following you?

617
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:34,521
Who ever they were,
they were not good

618
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:39,597
Then they..., daughter, are you
into something, that you...

619
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:45,231
Remember one thing, the end result
for a bad work, is always bad

620
01:10:45,808 --> 01:10:46,866
Forget it, Mr. Manmohan Lal

621
01:10:47,376 --> 01:10:49,344
All these philosphies sound
good, only in the books

622
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:51,043
Why is so much of
bitterness in you?

623
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:56,377
Sir, my father was a very
decent man

624
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:00,314
The man who killed him,
did a very bad thing-

625
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:03,687
But, the killer hasn't
yet reached to his end result-

626
01:11:03,959 --> 01:11:05,153
Then how can I believe -

627
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:07,427
That the end result for a
bad work is always bad

628
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:08,888
So your father.....

629
01:11:09,498 --> 01:11:13,093
Yes, Dr. Ashok soni

630
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:24,736
Dr. Ashok Soni, who killed him?
do you know?

631
01:11:24,913 --> 01:11:28,576
I don't know, but one day
I'll definitely know-

632
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,018
And, I am alive,
only for that day-

633
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:34,589
My every moment, every bit of me
is in search of that killer

634
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:39,084
Mr. Manmohan lal,
the day I get him

635
01:11:39,595 --> 01:11:42,689
Sir, he is lnspector Ravi Verma

636
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:43,893
Greetings

637
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:45,691
Greetings, please come

638
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:48,699
Mr. S.P had called me up,
that you wanted to meet me

639
01:11:49,004 --> 01:11:50,835
I need to get some
information about Jugran

640
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:51,371
Definitely

641
01:11:52,241 --> 01:11:54,038
Who would be more
pleased than me, if he is caught

642
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:56,870
Seema, there is a brother
of mine somewhere in this world-

643
01:11:57,413 --> 01:12:00,246
Jugran, twin, ldentical face.

644
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:01,581
Identical face

645
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:05,286
Mr. Manmohan Lal, Mr.S.P says
who ever has seen you both -

646
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:07,649
They say there is not a pinch
of difference between you both

647
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,489
Mr. Ravi, the only difference
is that -

648
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:12,184
He has lost in the
darkness of crime

649
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:16,730
This girl, where ever she
wants to go, drop her

650
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:17,558
Go daughter

651
01:12:22,104 --> 01:12:23,366
Mr. Manmohan Lal,
who is this girl?

652
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:25,907
If I am not worng, I have
seen her somewhere

653
01:12:26,809 --> 01:12:28,606
She is the daughter
of my late friend

654
01:12:29,778 --> 01:12:32,576
In her childhood itself,
she lost her father

655
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:39,654
It's straight-

656
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:42,551
What ever my daughter says in
this house only that will happen

657
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:47,219
That is why I say, my father
is the best among the world

658
01:12:48,263 --> 01:12:52,632
"D" uncle,"D" uncle, do you know
what my father tells me

659
01:12:53,769 --> 01:12:57,762
My daughter Simi is the best
daughter in the world, best....

660
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:05,008
In this palace of Dolls,
your doll will stay-

661
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:07,282
Like the way
you stay in this house

662
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:15,454
Come, sit into the car

663
01:13:22,297 --> 01:13:22,626
Come

664
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:27,467
I regret, I certainly regret-

665
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:29,161
That I had to call you
here in such a manner-

666
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:31,804
But, by coming here
you are only benefitted

667
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:38,979
Don't get surprised
by seeing me-

668
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:41,973
I know that you have
met my stupid brother-

669
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:43,775
Who has the cancer of decency

670
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:45,814
So, you are only
that Jugran

671
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:49,455
I know, Manmohan Lal spoke
about me, infornt of the lnspector-

672
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:51,926
And rest, whatever was told
there, I know it

673
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:55,294
So, You are in search of
your father, Dr. Ashok Soni's killer

674
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:56,591
I know, who he is?

675
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:02,165
Who is he?

676
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,929
I swear by the devil,
If I want, I can tell you

677
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:09,142
But, If I ever want to,
for that Miss. Seema Soni-

678
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:11,943
Even, you have to do
something for me

679
01:14:12,915 --> 01:14:14,644
I swear by the devil
Mr. Jugran

680
01:14:15,851 --> 01:14:19,810
You are not so clever,
as you think you are

681
01:14:20,355 --> 01:14:23,119
Just now you told, what ever
happens at your brother's house-

682
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:25,021
You come to know
everything of it

683
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:28,285
I am in search of
my father's killer-

684
01:14:28,664 --> 01:14:31,656
Even this was told there
which you came to know-

685
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:35,498
Apart from this. You are
totally oblivious about it

686
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:37,537
When your father was killed,-

687
01:14:37,706 --> 01:14:39,731
He was making
a "Palace of Dolls," for you

688
01:14:47,716 --> 01:14:49,047
This was not told
there by you

689
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:50,648
Am I worng?

690
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,946
You, You, all this.....

691
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:57,091
All this I listened
from the killer himself-

692
01:14:57,593 --> 01:14:59,823
I know him, and I can
hand him over to you

693
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:04,894
For this, for this, what is it
that I have to do?

694
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:07,861
You need a man,
that responsibility is mine-

695
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:11,662
And, I need a man
that responisbility is yours

696
01:15:17,212 --> 01:15:21,239
I need this man, there's a safe
which only he can open

697
01:15:21,783 --> 01:15:24,115
You make him prepare
to work for me

698
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:29,018
Why do you think that I can
make him prepare for this work?

699
01:15:30,993 --> 01:15:34,087
If a clever and beautiful girl,
like you asks such questions-

700
01:15:34,596 --> 01:15:37,064
I swear by the devil,
It doesn't sound good

701
01:15:37,332 --> 01:15:39,266
And, My father's killers
name and address

702
01:15:39,601 --> 01:15:41,694
The day he breaks open that
important safe for me

703
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:44,766
You'll get to know the name,
address of your father's killer

704
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:49,740
Okay, Okay, I'll give it a try

705
01:15:58,153 --> 01:16:00,348
Come on sweet hearts,
eat properly, don't drop it down

706
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:10,530
I think he must have gone in
search for some female pigeon

707
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:22,800
Today let me see, how good
a post man are you?

708
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:36,688
Oh, so finally you have come-

709
01:16:37,793 --> 01:16:39,920
Can I ask where were you
missing all the day?

710
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:43,023
Jango, I have told
you so many times-

711
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:45,731
That stop behaving
like pigeons

712
01:16:48,036 --> 01:16:49,060
What is it that is hanging
on your neck

713
01:16:59,314 --> 01:17:02,215
Romeo, your rememberance
very often comes to me-

714
01:17:02,884 --> 01:17:04,351
Even you must be remembering me,
don't you?

715
01:17:04,886 --> 01:17:06,183
What ever has
happened till date,

716
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:07,852
Let's forget it
and become friends

717
01:17:08,156 --> 01:17:11,250
I know, that you consider me both
beautiful as well as dangerous

718
01:17:11,827 --> 01:17:13,795
If you feel that, I am more
dangerous, then don't come-

719
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:15,789
And, If you feel that
I am more beautiful-

720
01:17:16,231 --> 01:17:17,528
Then, My address is
written below

721
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:20,627
Jango, whatever is true
is true

722
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:23,432
The girl, no doubt
is more beautiful

723
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:38,853
Madam,

724
01:17:43,792 --> 01:17:44,656
Madam

725
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:50,555
So, you have come

726
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:53,858
Madam, I have come only to know
that why did you call me here?

727
01:17:54,302 --> 01:17:55,997
Romeo, don't be so ignorant-

728
01:17:56,438 --> 01:18:01,569
When a beautiful girl, calls
a young boy alone to the house then-

729
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:03,802
Then, there is a definite
reason behind it

730
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:08,548
Intelligent, really intelligent

731
01:18:09,317 --> 01:18:11,877
Madam, the intelligence of mine
will be known to me-

732
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:15,649
Only when, you come out
from the curtain

733
01:18:29,604 --> 01:18:32,402
Here, I am out from
all the curtains

734
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:34,108
But, the secret is still
behind the curtain-

735
01:18:34,276 --> 01:18:35,334
That what exactly
do you want?

736
01:18:36,278 --> 01:18:37,575
A friendship with you

737
01:18:37,779 --> 01:18:38,609
But why?

738
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:43,011
That's because, now-a-days I am
working for a very big man

739
01:18:43,185 --> 01:18:43,651
So,

740
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:48,755
So, he requires you for a
very special assignment

741
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:52,590
Okay, Okay, Okay
so this is the matter

742
01:18:52,828 --> 01:18:57,128
The matter would be,
that you look into my eyes-

743
01:18:57,365 --> 01:19:01,768
And say that, you can do
anything for my friendship

744
01:19:02,304 --> 01:19:06,138
Madam, these beautiful eyes
this moon face, and these rosy lips-

745
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:08,805
Cannot lure a man like me

746
01:19:09,845 --> 01:19:11,403
I don't need your friendship

747
01:19:12,013 --> 01:19:15,312
In my life, I have always been
a loner and will remain a loner

748
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:18,951
And, If my beauty
stops your way, then

749
01:19:19,187 --> 01:19:20,449
Would you be able to
stop my way?

750
01:19:20,856 --> 01:19:22,187
Would you be able to
leave me and go?

751
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:23,450
Would you be able to
seduce me?

752
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:24,718
Would you be able to
sign me off?

753
01:19:24,993 --> 01:19:28,554
Madam, it is impossible that you
cast the magic of your eyes on me

754
01:19:28,997 --> 01:19:32,057
It possible that I melt your
heart with my seductive looks

755
01:19:32,234 --> 01:19:34,361
Madam, I'll not let
my heart to get melted

756
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:37,601
I am going, and this heart
is also going along with me

757
01:25:21,149 --> 01:25:26,246
In a very short span of time
we have come so close to each other

758
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:30,015
Very close

759
01:25:31,092 --> 01:25:36,325
So, should I understand that,
you will do that work for me

760
01:25:39,868 --> 01:25:42,098
No, No I'll not do it

761
01:25:44,172 --> 01:25:46,470
What? you'll not do it

762
01:25:48,176 --> 01:25:49,143
I'll not do it

763
01:25:50,044 --> 01:25:52,535
I spent a nice evening with you
thank you so much

764
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:53,044
But,...

765
01:26:06,461 --> 01:26:09,953
Don't forget that,
I know your reallity

766
01:26:11,399 --> 01:26:13,560
If I want, I can tell
it to the police

767
01:26:17,305 --> 01:26:21,105
Alright, what is the work
that you have with me

768
01:26:21,442 --> 01:26:24,673
Whatever the work is
it will not be difficult for you

769
01:26:26,314 --> 01:26:29,511
Okay, so this is it

770
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:35,020
Madam, difficulty is only in
forcing me, to do a work-

771
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:38,254
You tried to tempt me
with your beauty-

772
01:26:38,726 --> 01:26:41,320
With displaying the viles
of beauty and charm-

773
01:26:41,596 --> 01:26:43,530
You had tried to scare me
with the police and the gun-

774
01:26:43,965 --> 01:26:47,492
If you have any other cheap idea
then, try using that and see

775
01:26:48,803 --> 01:26:51,931
Madam, your repeated attempts
make me understand, only one thing

776
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:54,568
That how much gready
are you for money?

777
01:26:56,144 --> 01:26:57,372
Who hates money?-

778
01:26:57,645 --> 01:27:01,012
But, I haven't seen any other big
worshipper of money, than you

779
01:27:01,983 --> 01:27:06,147
I am confident, fully confidemt
that a wretched woman like you-

780
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:10,949
Would see nothing in her dreams
except for gold, silver & diamonds

781
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:12,717
Stop it Romeo, stop it

782
01:27:13,995 --> 01:27:15,622
How much ever you
wanted to say, you said-

783
01:27:15,964 --> 01:27:17,556
How much ever I had to
listen, I listened-

784
01:27:17,966 --> 01:27:19,797
And now, if you utter
a word more then I'll.....

785
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:26,766
I don't deny against
the opinion, that you hold for me

786
01:27:27,675 --> 01:27:30,439
But, before you go away
after calling me wretched and cheap-

787
01:27:30,612 --> 01:27:34,639
Listen to one thing, that I am not
doing all this for money-

788
01:27:35,483 --> 01:27:37,314
I am not doing this for money

789
01:27:37,552 --> 01:27:38,712
Then, for what are you
doing all this?

790
01:27:41,823 --> 01:27:42,949
Do you want to know?

791
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:46,954
Yes, I want to know

792
01:28:10,918 --> 01:28:12,977
You want to know?
then look there

793
01:28:14,722 --> 01:28:19,022
The lost lifeless woman who is
sitting like a stone statue-

794
01:28:20,728 --> 01:28:21,422
Is my mother

795
01:28:26,167 --> 01:28:28,362
17 years ago my father was
lying on the ground

796
01:28:29,404 --> 01:28:30,894
Drowned in his own blood

797
01:28:32,874 --> 01:28:36,241
17 years ago I heard the voice
of my mother for the last time

798
01:28:37,412 --> 01:28:41,007
It was not a voice but shriek
a painful shriek

799
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:54,152
I laugh when people talk about
principles and justice

800
01:28:55,963 --> 01:28:59,592
The person who killed my father
did he get any punishment?

801
01:29:00,134 --> 01:29:00,532
No.

802
01:29:01,102 --> 01:29:03,036
The person who made my mother
a living dead body

803
01:29:03,571 --> 01:29:04,799
Did he get any punishment?

804
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:05,901
No

805
01:29:06,507 --> 01:29:08,907
The person who ruined my home
my life

806
01:29:09,043 --> 01:29:11,409
Did he get any punishment?
No, No

807
01:29:14,582 --> 01:29:18,348
What ever I am doing is an
effort to reach that murderer

808
01:29:19,253 --> 01:29:22,017
Whether you help me or not
or anybody helps me or not

809
01:29:23,257 --> 01:29:24,281
But the one who ruined

810
01:29:25,893 --> 01:29:28,919
The happy home of the
darling daughter of her parents

811
01:29:29,864 --> 01:29:34,892
And sent her to the orphanage
I will never forgive him

812
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:42,439
I will never forgive him.
Never forgive him

813
01:30:09,937 --> 01:30:11,029
Atleast now did you come to know

814
01:30:11,939 --> 01:30:14,100
Diamonds and jewels
don't come in my dreams

815
01:30:15,977 --> 01:30:17,968
But the lifeless face of my father

816
01:30:18,946 --> 01:30:20,914
And the painful shrieks of
my mother comes in them

817
01:30:29,157 --> 01:30:33,025
A robber entered a man's house
good or bad?

818
01:30:33,528 --> 01:30:34,256
Bad

819
01:30:34,629 --> 01:30:36,324
But there was nothing in the
house that could be robbed

820
01:30:36,597 --> 01:30:37,120
Good

821
01:30:37,665 --> 01:30:39,098
After this the robber
got furious

822
01:30:39,367 --> 01:30:41,232
Taking a big stick
he went to his bed

823
01:30:41,369 --> 01:30:42,165
He hit him one hard blow

824
01:30:42,537 --> 01:30:43,094
Bad

825
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:45,171
But the man was
not sleeping on the bed

826
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:46,729
Good

827
01:31:15,436 --> 01:31:18,496
Seema has told Romeo whom
she is searching for?

828
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:22,070
But, before leaving Simi didn't ask
her childhood friend

829
01:31:22,376 --> 01:31:27,109
Ramesh that after recognizing her
Is he prepared to help her or not?

830
01:31:27,982 --> 01:31:30,951
I am here only, Seema if you
like you can ask even now

831
01:32:07,955 --> 01:32:08,353
Jugran Sir,

832
01:32:10,024 --> 01:32:13,425
I have brought the person
whom you wanted to meet

833
01:32:17,064 --> 01:32:18,531
So you are that magician

834
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,764
With one flick of whose
hands safes open

835
01:32:23,638 --> 01:32:24,502
I swear by the Devil

836
01:32:25,573 --> 01:32:28,838
You have a great reputation in
this game.

837
01:32:29,610 --> 01:32:34,138
People like coloured fish
but I like Tortoise

838
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:37,510
And I like, Pigeons

839
01:32:38,319 --> 01:32:39,081
But Mr. Jugran

840
01:32:40,288 --> 01:32:41,619
I don't think you have not
called me here-

841
01:32:41,822 --> 01:32:44,552
To talk about fish, tortoise
and Pigeons

842
01:32:45,426 --> 01:32:46,222
Shall we talk business

843
01:32:58,639 --> 01:32:59,435
This is that safe

844
01:33:00,174 --> 01:33:01,903
You have to open a safe
like this for me

845
01:33:02,276 --> 01:33:03,300
Your work will be done

846
01:33:03,678 --> 01:33:05,145
But this job is not so easy

847
01:33:05,613 --> 01:33:07,604
Because, if you can open this
safe in 15 minutes-

848
01:33:07,815 --> 01:33:09,407
Then you are useful to me

849
01:33:10,017 --> 01:33:12,508
But, if you take 16 minutes
then you are no good for me

850
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:16,417
In 15 minutes I can open
the safe 3 times

851
01:33:16,490 --> 01:33:18,117
He is talking non-sense
Mr. Jugran

852
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:20,322
A person who is carrying a
pigeon on his shoulder-

853
01:33:20,528 --> 01:33:21,517
How can he open this safe

854
01:33:25,499 --> 01:33:28,263
You are very proud of
your talent, let me also see

855
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:31,564
Jango one minute

856
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:40,679
Keep on looking at your watch
see how much time do I take

857
01:34:34,101 --> 01:34:34,863
How much time did I take?

858
01:34:35,970 --> 01:34:37,164
5 minutes

859
01:34:38,205 --> 01:34:41,902
That's why I said that I can
open the safe 3 times in 15 minutes

860
01:34:42,009 --> 01:34:42,737
what's your name?

861
01:34:42,977 --> 01:34:43,375
Keshav

862
01:34:44,045 --> 01:34:45,808
Keshav, Pigeons are of
two types

863
01:34:46,647 --> 01:34:47,739
Some have the face of a pigeon-

864
01:34:47,948 --> 01:34:48,937
And some have the
intellect of pigeons

865
01:34:49,984 --> 01:34:51,679
Jango has only a face of a
pigeon and you are-

866
01:34:52,219 --> 01:34:52,685
A pigeon with an intellect

867
01:34:52,987 --> 01:34:54,978
Jugran Sir, why have you kept
this pigeon as a pet-

868
01:34:55,356 --> 01:34:57,654
Jugran Sir, this man
may be useful to you

869
01:34:58,159 --> 01:34:59,820
But, make this Rascal
understand that he shouldn't.....

870
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:04,697
You talk too much Keshav

871
01:35:06,167 --> 01:35:10,160
In front of so many people
you have... I am going

872
01:35:17,378 --> 01:35:19,175
Come Romeo and see.

873
01:35:21,682 --> 01:35:23,411
Every month a train
from Chandipur station

874
01:35:23,951 --> 01:35:25,145
Brings a safe to Bombay

875
01:35:25,653 --> 01:35:28,178
In this safe Kohinoor diamond Co's.,
diamonds are kept

876
01:35:28,823 --> 01:35:32,088
This train passes through
a lonely stretch for 15 minutes

877
01:35:32,626 --> 01:35:34,958
You will have only 15 minutes

878
01:35:35,863 --> 01:35:38,593
Withing 15 minutes you have to
open the wagon and the safe

879
01:35:38,699 --> 01:35:39,927
And come out with the diamonds

880
01:35:40,234 --> 01:35:41,633
When has the job to be pulled

881
01:35:41,702 --> 01:35:43,932
When exactly the safe
will come in the train

882
01:35:44,238 --> 01:35:49,801
Nobody knows till the last moment
except Co's., G.M., D.K.Malhotra

883
01:35:50,511 --> 01:35:52,240
D.K. Malhotra in a sealed envelope-

884
01:35:52,446 --> 01:35:55,006
Informs the owners of
the diamonds

885
01:35:55,649 --> 01:35:58,709
But he has a copy of the
letter in his safe also

886
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:02,721
To know that, this train will
start when and on what date

887
01:36:03,424 --> 01:36:05,949
We will have to open
D.K. Malhotra's safe

888
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:08,751
I swear by the Devil,-

889
01:36:08,963 --> 01:36:11,363
It is easy to converse with
intelligent people

890
01:36:12,066 --> 01:36:16,093
To reach the safe of
D.K. Malhotra we have to plan

891
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:18,465
D.K. Malhotra has made it
easy for us himself.

892
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:21,533
He is throwing a big party on
Tuesday in the Co's., banquet hall-

893
01:36:21,642 --> 01:36:23,872
And the entire arrangement for
the party is with our hotel

894
01:36:24,645 --> 01:36:27,079
D.K. Malhotra's flat is on
the top floor of that building

895
01:36:27,681 --> 01:36:29,376
Every body will be watching
Seema's dance in the party-

896
01:36:29,583 --> 01:36:32,143
And you will open the safe in
D.K. Malhotra's study

897
01:36:32,353 --> 01:36:35,345
From which you will know
the day and time of train's departure

898
01:36:36,690 --> 01:36:40,148
Once you give me those
diamonds, I swear by the Devil-

899
01:36:41,395 --> 01:36:42,692
I will guide you to reach
the murderer of Seema's father

900
01:36:55,209 --> 01:36:57,677
Remember Seema we
used to come here often

901
01:36:58,179 --> 01:37:01,080
Probably you love for the pigeons
started from here only.

902
01:37:01,282 --> 01:37:04,513
Yes, My love for the pigeons
also started from here

903
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:08,010
And one day both of us there....

904
01:37:11,192 --> 01:37:13,592
Seema you wait here
I will come

905
01:37:15,596 --> 01:37:20,056
My dear Son, you are here
with such sweet Company.

906
01:37:20,868 --> 01:37:22,165
What is the story?

907
01:37:22,603 --> 01:37:24,571
Girdhari Sir, it is no more
business relation with her-

908
01:37:24,772 --> 01:37:25,261
It's something else

909
01:37:25,439 --> 01:37:27,373
Oh it is something else!

910
01:37:29,610 --> 01:37:33,410
I have wasted all my life
in earning money

911
01:37:34,615 --> 01:37:36,242
I never did anything else

912
01:37:36,917 --> 01:37:39,147
Okay, atleast you do
something else.

913
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:42,516
But first do one thing for me.

914
01:37:43,290 --> 01:37:43,949
What is it?

915
01:37:44,124 --> 01:37:49,084
In Mayfair hotel,tomorrow
there is a big exibition of jewellry

916
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:51,163
And in this exhibition
beautiful models-

917
01:37:51,298 --> 01:37:52,890
Will come on the stage
wearing jewels

918
01:37:53,534 --> 01:37:54,762
There will be
countless on lookers-

919
01:37:54,902 --> 01:37:56,529
And many secuirty guards.

920
01:37:57,304 --> 01:38:00,796
Sorry Girdhari Sir, I can open the
lock of a safe but.

921
01:38:01,242 --> 01:38:03,210
I cannot close the eyes of
so many on lookers

922
01:38:04,278 --> 01:38:05,609
My dear Son.

923
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:11,449
I was thinking of making a
hostel of your Bal-Bhavan

924
01:38:11,652 --> 01:38:14,314
But Girdhari Sir, how will l
reach the stage

925
01:38:14,421 --> 01:38:15,581
I can make you reach there

926
01:38:18,959 --> 01:38:20,290
Perhaps you don't know

927
01:38:20,661 --> 01:38:22,891
That in the world of fashion
and modelling

928
01:38:23,264 --> 01:38:25,289
I am known as the queen
of beauty

929
01:38:25,933 --> 01:38:29,300
I can make you reach to the stage
where the jewellery will be

930
01:38:29,937 --> 01:38:31,370
My dear daughter

931
01:38:32,106 --> 01:38:34,904
I like your suggestion so much-

932
01:38:35,509 --> 01:38:38,501
That I did not feel offended
after knowing

933
01:38:38,946 --> 01:38:42,404
That you were listening
to us stealthily

934
01:38:43,884 --> 01:38:48,116
What ever we did till today
we did it as opponents

935
01:38:48,522 --> 01:38:50,547
Let us work as parteners now
and see

936
01:38:51,325 --> 01:38:53,486
After all what ever you would
do for the Bal-Bhavan

937
01:38:54,028 --> 01:38:55,086
Even I have stayed in it

938
01:38:55,429 --> 01:38:59,456
If the queen of beauty
paves the way to reach there

939
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:02,664
Then, the king of thieves will
find a way to escape from there

940
01:44:49,316 --> 01:44:49,873
Beware

941
01:44:53,253 --> 01:44:57,451
If anyone acts smart. I will
Shoot the girl. Shut up

942
01:44:58,025 --> 01:45:00,016
Ay, throw the gun down.

943
01:45:01,528 --> 01:45:02,324
Bend down

944
01:45:02,529 --> 01:45:03,496
Bend down

945
01:45:09,169 --> 01:45:12,627
Hey mister, Clear the way
show must have started

946
01:45:14,941 --> 01:45:16,568
There is problem every where.
Run

947
01:45:34,561 --> 01:45:36,392
Darling this car is going
backwards

948
01:45:36,830 --> 01:45:38,491
It is going backwards like you

949
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:41,167
Oh! on top of the Car

950
01:45:47,607 --> 01:45:50,906
Hey donkey, haven't you paid the
Road Tax to the Municipality-

951
01:45:51,111 --> 01:45:52,442
You are driving over our car

952
01:45:52,746 --> 01:45:54,941
What are you thinking
of my car

953
01:45:55,482 --> 01:45:58,918
Stop laughing. Put the
jewellery in the brief-case

954
01:45:59,453 --> 01:46:01,353
Why am I not looking beautiful?-

955
01:46:01,555 --> 01:46:02,544
You are looking very beautiful-

956
01:46:02,956 --> 01:46:04,753
But we won't be looking
beautiful in the Jail

957
01:46:08,495 --> 01:46:11,430
Take out the Jewellery Seema
and have the brief-case with you

958
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:15,290
Hey, what's all this-

959
01:46:16,236 --> 01:46:17,999
Why are you laughing?

960
01:46:18,171 --> 01:46:19,695
My husband is suffering -

961
01:46:19,806 --> 01:46:21,706
Come down.
I have only one husband

962
01:46:23,944 --> 01:46:24,706
Stop

963
01:46:26,580 --> 01:46:28,912
Darling, who is exploding the
crackers-

964
01:46:29,049 --> 01:46:30,380
I say stop

965
01:46:39,025 --> 01:46:41,721
Darling, one has got down and
the other has climbed up.

966
01:46:41,828 --> 01:46:44,262
Give me the brief-case and do
as I had told you. - Look out

967
01:46:54,641 --> 01:46:55,767
Oh! it has become 50-50

968
01:46:55,942 --> 01:46:57,102
Go, come fast

969
01:47:13,427 --> 01:47:17,659
Oh lnspector Sir,! come soon
you have become very late-

970
01:47:18,265 --> 01:47:19,493
He is hiding some where here.

971
01:47:19,833 --> 01:47:23,428
Hey, where are you? I will
kill you, my jewels are missing.

972
01:47:23,637 --> 01:47:26,037
Hey, where is he?
where has he gone?

973
01:47:27,841 --> 01:47:29,433
He has run away

974
01:47:30,277 --> 01:47:32,507
Where will he run & go? He will
definately be caught, well...

975
01:47:32,712 --> 01:47:35,306
He pointed the revolver and took
you outside. Then what happened?

976
01:47:35,449 --> 01:47:38,179
Then he said that if you
want to remain alive-

977
01:47:38,385 --> 01:47:40,046
Then quietly sit in the Car

978
01:47:40,887 --> 01:47:45,756
As I wanted to remain alive,
so I sat in the Car quietly

979
01:47:48,562 --> 01:47:49,187
Then

980
01:47:49,496 --> 01:47:54,729
Then, the car started, But you
can say it flew away

981
01:47:55,435 --> 01:47:58,199
The Car was going very fast.
very fast

982
01:47:58,638 --> 01:48:02,039
That cruel robber was laughing
like a villion in a movie

983
01:48:04,311 --> 01:48:05,608
Behind there were police cars....

984
01:48:08,515 --> 01:48:11,109
Revolver was stuck in my head

985
01:48:11,318 --> 01:48:11,807
Then

986
01:48:12,152 --> 01:48:13,642
Then he said

987
01:48:14,521 --> 01:48:19,390
Mona darling remove all the
jewels put them in my bag

988
01:48:19,659 --> 01:48:20,182
Bad cheat

989
01:48:20,327 --> 01:48:22,420
And you removed all the jewels
and put them in the bag

990
01:48:22,629 --> 01:48:25,223
Just think inspector Sir,
If you were in my place

991
01:48:25,465 --> 01:48:27,262
And you have had ear-rings
in the ear, bangles on the hand-

992
01:48:27,434 --> 01:48:28,059
Necklace in the neck

993
01:48:28,201 --> 01:48:29,065
Pendant on the forehead

994
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:32,162
You would have looked funny

995
01:48:32,405 --> 01:48:35,306
You.. You...
what do you want to say?

996
01:48:35,609 --> 01:48:38,305
If someone had put the
revolver on your head

997
01:48:38,578 --> 01:48:39,567
What would you have done?

998
01:48:39,846 --> 01:48:41,108
You also would have
Removed the jewels isn't it

999
01:48:41,214 --> 01:48:41,680
Yes

1000
01:48:43,283 --> 01:48:44,875
Then.... then what happened?

1001
01:48:45,085 --> 01:48:47,747
He stopped his car, picked up
his bag and told me -

1002
01:48:48,121 --> 01:48:52,319
Hey, girl if you try to follow me
then I will fry you

1003
01:48:52,526 --> 01:48:53,618
Fry you?

1004
01:48:53,894 --> 01:48:56,419
Yes.... No, No No No it was
something about cooking

1005
01:48:56,963 --> 01:48:59,523
Yes, if you try to follow me
then I will roast you

1006
01:48:59,933 --> 01:49:03,733
He said that and disappeared

1007
01:49:04,437 --> 01:49:05,802
Why didn't you try to stop him

1008
01:49:08,808 --> 01:49:13,939
I want to say something sir
after hearing this girl

1009
01:49:14,781 --> 01:49:18,148
I don't know why, but this girl
is telling the truth

1010
01:49:19,452 --> 01:49:20,680
And under those circumstances -

1011
01:49:21,555 --> 01:49:25,389
In front of the Rascal,
what else this girl could do

1012
01:49:28,662 --> 01:49:31,028
She,she was under compulsion

1013
01:49:32,265 --> 01:49:33,459
She was helpless

1014
01:49:37,270 --> 01:49:40,865
Okay, You go with him, give your
statement and give your address

1015
01:49:41,007 --> 01:49:41,974
And then you can go

1016
01:49:46,212 --> 01:49:47,907
Then, Shall we go?

1017
01:49:48,548 --> 01:49:49,742
Yes let's go

1018
01:49:53,019 --> 01:49:57,080
Great, great, great

1019
01:49:58,158 --> 01:50:01,321
My dear son, you have formed
a nice pair

1020
01:50:01,528 --> 01:50:02,825
Thank you very much Girdhari Sir,

1021
01:50:02,896 --> 01:50:03,590
You are gold, and she
is its glitter

1022
01:50:06,132 --> 01:50:07,997
But, for some you'll have to
forget this gold

1023
01:50:08,335 --> 01:50:11,668
I will forget.
But remember one thing-

1024
01:50:12,005 --> 01:50:14,200
If you work for someone else,

1025
01:50:14,708 --> 01:50:17,734
Then, I am very emotional,
I will get offended

1026
01:50:18,144 --> 01:50:21,170
Don't worry.
This is not your department's work

1027
01:50:21,648 --> 01:50:22,740
Then what's the story?

1028
01:50:23,883 --> 01:50:27,375
The story is, that to
reach a particular person-

1029
01:50:27,787 --> 01:50:29,186
I need the help of Romeo

1030
01:50:29,389 --> 01:50:30,356
Who is he?

1031
01:50:31,891 --> 01:50:32,516
I don't know

1032
01:50:32,959 --> 01:50:35,689
I will tell Seema that her
father's murderer is none else,

1033
01:50:36,062 --> 01:50:38,758
But, Jugran himself.
I will tell her

1034
01:50:39,065 --> 01:50:39,929
Have you gone mad?

1035
01:50:40,066 --> 01:50:43,558
Yes, I have gone mad
in front of everybody...

1036
01:50:44,237 --> 01:50:46,228
I have flattered him enough

1037
01:50:46,539 --> 01:50:48,166
Now I will reveal
his true character

1038
01:51:01,087 --> 01:51:02,816
Yes speaking.
Who are you?

1039
01:51:03,156 --> 01:51:04,123
Never mind who I am-

1040
01:51:04,424 --> 01:51:07,393
But, I can tell you this much that
who is your father's murderer?

1041
01:51:07,827 --> 01:51:08,794
And where he is

1042
01:51:10,030 --> 01:51:11,156
Where will I find him?

1043
01:51:11,364 --> 01:51:13,161
In the same party where
you are going tomorrow

1044
01:51:13,333 --> 01:51:15,062
The name of your
father's murderer is......

1045
01:51:24,878 --> 01:51:27,813
D' Uncle, that murderer is
going to come in that party.

1046
01:51:28,715 --> 01:51:31,411
You had said one day that
you can recognize him.

1047
01:51:32,385 --> 01:51:35,354
Seema, to help you, I will come
where ever you want me to

1048
01:51:40,326 --> 01:51:42,419
Tiwari, had you told Balwant
to wait for me

1049
01:51:42,662 --> 01:51:43,924
I am going to
D.K. Malhotra's party

1050
01:57:43,823 --> 01:57:45,222
18th of November

1051
01:58:56,229 --> 01:58:57,355
They are still children

1052
01:58:58,564 --> 01:59:00,498
They thought that with the
help of that old man D'silva

1053
01:59:00,766 --> 01:59:02,427
They will locate that murderer

1054
01:59:03,603 --> 01:59:05,070
But, I swear by Devil

1055
01:59:05,905 --> 01:59:08,203
Neither Romeo knows
nor does that poor Seema

1056
01:59:08,641 --> 01:59:10,734
That I can to both of them
for the rest of their lives-

1057
01:59:10,910 --> 01:59:12,741
Make them dance to my tunes

1058
01:59:13,813 --> 01:59:14,939
But Jugran Sir, how did
all this happen?

1059
01:59:15,581 --> 01:59:16,605
The moment you told me that-

1060
01:59:16,816 --> 01:59:18,477
Keshav was talking to
Seema over phone

1061
01:59:18,751 --> 01:59:20,378
I thought till
this party is over-

1062
01:59:20,586 --> 01:59:22,019
Seema should be kept
under surveilliance

1063
01:59:26,125 --> 01:59:28,753
When she went to meet D'silva
my men were following her

1064
01:59:29,095 --> 01:59:30,722
They heard her conversation
with D'silva-

1065
01:59:31,063 --> 01:59:32,291
And after Seema had left-

1066
01:59:32,465 --> 01:59:34,933
D'silva's daughter and her
child were kidnapped -

1067
01:59:35,334 --> 01:59:37,564
And D'silva was told
that if he opens his mouth-

1068
01:59:37,870 --> 01:59:39,064
Both of them will be killed

1069
01:59:39,205 --> 01:59:40,729
Then the same thing happened
that I wanted

1070
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:43,240
Now Sir, what will you do with
D'silva's daughter and her child

1071
01:59:43,376 --> 01:59:44,741
What will I do?
I will release them

1072
01:59:44,844 --> 01:59:47,506
If after that D'silva talks to
Romeo and Seema then?

1073
01:59:49,048 --> 01:59:50,572
You didn't understand Balwant

1074
01:59:51,117 --> 01:59:54,575
I will leave them but,
I will kill D'silva

1075
01:59:54,954 --> 01:59:55,579
Understood

1076
01:59:55,788 --> 01:59:56,720
Understood Sir,

1077
02:00:02,094 --> 02:00:02,788
Come on get down

1078
02:00:03,162 --> 02:00:03,821
Come

1079
02:00:33,726 --> 02:00:35,284
No....

1080
02:00:46,872 --> 02:00:48,567
Don't take it as an
obligation Rosy

1081
02:00:49,075 --> 02:00:50,906
What ever I am doing
is my duty

1082
02:00:51,210 --> 02:00:53,303
Only, because of me he
did that to Mr. D'Silva...

1083
02:00:55,982 --> 02:00:58,473
I am hardly doing
anything for you

1084
02:00:58,884 --> 02:01:03,150
No, Seema both of you have done
everything for me and for my child

1085
02:01:04,023 --> 02:01:05,820
You have made provision
for my entire life

1086
02:01:09,462 --> 02:01:11,862
Is nothing in proportion
to Mr. D'silva's life

1087
02:01:13,699 --> 02:01:15,098
What happened Rosy?
What are you looking at

1088
02:01:15,301 --> 02:01:19,863
That Car Seema, Romeo that Car
that car only hit my Daddy

1089
02:01:42,261 --> 02:01:45,025
Rangbirangey. Any news
about D'silva's case

1090
02:01:48,301 --> 02:01:53,204
Which D'silva, what D'silva,
where from D'silva Sir

1091
02:01:53,272 --> 02:01:54,933
That D'silva who was crushed
by a car on the road-

1092
02:01:55,007 --> 02:01:57,567
Whose daughter had reported that
it wasn't an accident case

1093
02:01:57,743 --> 02:02:00,109
Oh! I see, that case

1094
02:02:00,346 --> 02:02:04,214
Sir, I think we'll have to close
down that case because

1095
02:02:04,517 --> 02:02:07,213
Statement of deceased's daughter
and her child has been taken-

1096
02:02:09,255 --> 02:02:10,722
Rosy what ever we have
done for you-

1097
02:02:11,257 --> 02:02:12,224
They only said that the black
car was an old model Ford-

1098
02:02:13,259 --> 02:02:15,318
But, nobody has noted its number
That's all sir

1099
02:02:15,795 --> 02:02:18,195
There may be many old Fords
in the city -

1100
02:02:18,331 --> 02:02:19,889
But and till you get the
number of the car....

1101
02:02:20,066 --> 02:02:21,465
You can get the number

1102
02:02:25,204 --> 02:02:26,466
May I come in

1103
02:02:28,774 --> 02:02:31,743
Ravi Sir, the car which
killed Mr. D'silva

1104
02:02:32,178 --> 02:02:34,203
You can get its number

1105
02:02:34,380 --> 02:02:37,543
So, What have you brought,
The Car's No. or the Car's No. plate

1106
02:02:38,050 --> 02:02:40,610
Neither the car's No. nor
the car's No. plate

1107
02:02:42,121 --> 02:02:44,589
I have brought this pigeon

1108
02:02:44,924 --> 02:02:46,391
Pigeon

1109
02:02:46,525 --> 02:02:50,484
Though he is a pigeon but he is
my friend, his name Jango

1110
02:02:51,297 --> 02:02:53,765
The Car which hit Mr. D'silva

1111
02:02:54,633 --> 02:02:56,726
His daughter
recognized that Car today

1112
02:02:57,269 --> 02:03:02,070
This Pigeon Jango was present there
Jango flew and follwed the Car.

1113
02:03:02,475 --> 02:03:04,966
Jango recognizes the No.
and can tell you too

1114
02:03:05,144 --> 02:03:08,045
This is Bullshit
this is all frivolous talk

1115
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:11,249
The job that this Rangbirangey
couldn't do. Can this pigeon do it

1116
02:03:11,617 --> 02:03:13,778
If that is possible the Govt.
will close the police stations

1117
02:03:13,986 --> 02:03:15,510
And open pigeon houses

1118
02:03:17,156 --> 02:03:18,384
Please continue Mr. Romeo

1119
02:03:18,791 --> 02:03:20,452
If you permit me then should l....

1120
02:03:31,837 --> 02:03:34,806
What was the No. of that
Car Jango? tell them

1121
02:03:46,385 --> 02:03:47,352
Seven

1122
02:03:49,355 --> 02:03:50,083
Three

1123
02:03:56,028 --> 02:03:56,687
Nine

1124
02:04:00,132 --> 02:04:00,928
Six

1125
02:04:04,103 --> 02:04:07,539
7396 is the No. of that Car

1126
02:04:13,345 --> 02:04:17,304
If this pigeon can recognize
and tell the No. of the Car

1127
02:04:17,650 --> 02:04:20,016
Then why not make him the
traffic constable Sir.

1128
02:04:20,286 --> 02:04:22,345
Constable pigeon

1129
02:04:28,461 --> 02:04:31,021
Very good, like you, your pigeon
is also marvellous

1130
02:04:31,230 --> 02:04:34,631
Jango considers his duty
to help the law

1131
02:04:35,067 --> 02:04:36,034
Yes, I am sure

1132
02:04:36,368 --> 02:04:38,734
And now, can I go

1133
02:04:39,004 --> 02:04:41,996
No No, people like you don't come
to the police station often

1134
02:04:42,174 --> 02:04:43,038
Have tea and go

1135
02:04:43,175 --> 02:04:47,475
Okay, Mr. Ravi, Jango you go
I will come later

1136
02:04:48,714 --> 02:04:49,840
Jango doesn't take tea.

1137
02:04:49,982 --> 02:04:50,607
Really

1138
02:04:50,749 --> 02:04:51,977
Sir, your phone

1139
02:05:00,926 --> 02:05:02,894
Yes sir, I am working
on that Case

1140
02:05:27,720 --> 02:05:29,381
Your, your lock?

1141
02:05:29,622 --> 02:05:31,419
Yes Sir, it's quiet unique

1142
02:05:32,825 --> 02:05:33,792
And its key?

1143
02:05:35,160 --> 02:05:36,184
I lost it in my childhood.

1144
02:06:12,898 --> 02:06:16,959
How long the thief will be lucky
Afterall I am a police officer

1145
02:06:17,303 --> 02:06:21,262
I have neither sympathy for such
law breaker nor mercy

1146
02:06:21,607 --> 02:06:26,203
I assure you Sir, one day it will
be robbers hand and my Manacles

1147
02:06:58,043 --> 02:06:59,067
Sorry you had to wait

1148
02:06:59,378 --> 02:07:01,005
Sir, your mother and
sister have come

1149
02:07:01,513 --> 02:07:03,276
Oh God! I have to take
mother to the doctor

1150
02:07:05,851 --> 02:07:07,512
Sorry Mr. Romeo if you don't
mind I have to go

1151
02:07:07,653 --> 02:07:08,347
No it doesn't matter

1152
02:07:15,861 --> 02:07:41,347
Romeo, if you want to go back to them
then there is only one way.

1153
02:07:42,621 --> 02:07:44,282
You will have to
change your life

1154
02:07:45,357 --> 02:07:48,258
You will have to swear
that after today

1155
02:07:49,028 --> 02:07:54,557
You will not commit any crime nor rob- never....

1156
02:07:54,967 --> 02:07:55,558
Tomorrow

1157
02:07:57,369 --> 02:07:59,337
Tomorrow Romeo will bring the
diamonds from that train

1158
02:08:00,372 --> 02:08:02,863
And I will know the name of
your murderer daddy

1159
02:08:04,143 --> 02:08:06,270
Tomorrow Romeo will reach me
to my destination

1160
02:08:09,181 --> 02:08:11,012
So tomorrow it's your
examination

1161
02:08:12,918 --> 02:08:15,819
Come, I will tell you how you
will reach the running train-

1162
02:08:15,988 --> 02:08:16,818
And how we will take you out

1163
02:08:17,022 --> 02:08:18,751
I will not commit this theft
Mr.Jugran

1164
02:08:28,300 --> 02:08:30,768
I swear by the devil
you will commit it

1165
02:08:32,204 --> 02:08:35,503
You think that you can force me
to do any job like this?

1166
02:08:35,674 --> 02:08:39,405
And you think you can refuse
to do any job that I ask you

1167
02:08:41,313 --> 02:08:43,042
I am not accustomed
of hearing a no

1168
02:08:58,931 --> 02:09:02,628
So Mr. Jugran if you are not
accustomed to hear no

1169
02:09:03,102 --> 02:09:06,936
Then you will have to change
this habit of yours

1170
02:09:08,974 --> 02:09:11,738
The claws of the pigeons
are not usually so sharp

1171
02:09:12,678 --> 02:09:15,841
Come Seema, come on, What an
opportune time you have come.

1172
02:09:19,251 --> 02:09:21,276
What, what is this?

1173
02:09:22,354 --> 02:09:24,379
This is revolver. revolver

1174
02:09:25,390 --> 02:09:26,755
Without firing it,
Romeo -

1175
02:09:27,192 --> 02:09:28,989
The deal that was struck
between both of us-

1176
02:09:29,528 --> 02:09:30,495
He has fired it

1177
02:09:32,998 --> 02:09:35,831
Isn't it Romeo?
Is this the fact?

1178
02:09:36,468 --> 02:09:36,957
No

1179
02:09:39,204 --> 02:09:42,833
Romeo is not like this
He can't do this.

1180
02:09:47,546 --> 02:09:48,843
Give an answer Romeo

1181
02:09:50,282 --> 02:09:52,341
Sweet heart is asking
something

1182
02:09:54,019 --> 02:09:55,611
Sweet heart wants to know

1183
02:09:55,821 --> 02:09:58,619
To find out about her father's murderer

1184
02:09:59,258 --> 02:10:01,590
Can you do something or not

1185
02:10:09,234 --> 02:10:12,169
Do you know what will
I do when I grow up?

1186
02:10:12,571 --> 02:10:17,008
Along with you, I will kill the
man who killed your father

1187
02:10:29,988 --> 02:10:32,889
Today for the last time I will
do this job for you

1188
02:10:34,059 --> 02:10:36,619
But tomorrow if you
don't tell Seema-

1189
02:10:36,829 --> 02:10:38,626
The name and address
of that murderer

1190
02:10:39,598 --> 02:10:41,691
Or if the name and address
is not correct

1191
02:10:43,202 --> 02:10:47,366
Then all your loyal dogs can't
protect you from me

1192
02:10:54,546 --> 02:10:56,070
I swear by the devil

1193
02:10:58,150 --> 02:11:01,517
Love can force a person
to do any thing

1194
02:11:06,625 --> 02:11:09,526
3 Guards will be inside the
compartment and one in guards room

1195
02:11:09,795 --> 02:11:12,059
And this compartment will be
sealed from outside. Okay

1196
02:11:23,909 --> 02:11:26,434
Okay Seema you remember
what you have to do

1197
02:11:27,346 --> 02:11:28,074
Yes, I remember

1198
02:11:30,983 --> 02:11:32,211
Romeo I know-

1199
02:11:33,785 --> 02:11:37,277
That you are doing this
dangerous job only for me-

1200
02:11:37,422 --> 02:11:38,286
No Seema

1201
02:11:39,324 --> 02:11:43,283
Not only for you only,
but for me too

1202
02:11:44,830 --> 02:11:47,355
Besides I and you there is
another word in the world

1203
02:12:18,764 --> 02:12:20,425
I had cautioned

1204
02:12:21,967 --> 02:12:27,064
That apart from me don't work
for anyone else my son

1205
02:12:27,773 --> 02:12:29,502
But he is working

1206
02:12:30,208 --> 02:12:33,006
Now see I am offendend

1207
02:12:34,713 --> 02:12:39,207
Connect the phone to the
Police Head Quaters

1208
02:19:25,957 --> 02:19:27,754
Take the bag first.
after that...

1209
02:20:01,359 --> 02:20:02,383
Don't forget to take the bag

1210
02:20:09,367 --> 02:20:10,527
Sir, he has fallen
into the water

1211
02:20:26,184 --> 02:20:28,015
Sir, he is running. He should
not remain alive shoot him

1212
02:20:47,005 --> 02:20:50,964
Let's go, that's why I asked you
to wait there Seema-

1213
02:20:51,276 --> 02:20:53,244
Because, I knew their
intentions well

1214
02:20:53,878 --> 02:20:56,438
Bravo Romeo, how
clever you are.....

1215
02:21:00,518 --> 02:21:03,681
Oh! this character is also there
in the story

1216
02:21:03,922 --> 02:21:07,449
Get down from the Jeep
my dear Son. Come

1217
02:21:09,160 --> 02:21:11,651
And my dear daughter
you also come down

1218
02:21:11,963 --> 02:21:15,922
My dear son, what is the story

1219
02:21:16,501 --> 02:21:23,065
You forgot your old partner, give
give those diamonds to me

1220
02:21:23,374 --> 02:21:25,274
Till I am alive I won't give
Girdhari Boss

1221
02:21:26,811 --> 02:21:30,679
Alright. I'll take them
after your death

1222
02:21:31,583 --> 02:21:34,746
Do one thing,
shoot both of them

1223
02:22:11,122 --> 02:22:12,384
Sorry Girdhari Boss,

1224
02:22:12,690 --> 02:22:14,055
These bullets were
meant for me-

1225
02:22:14,225 --> 02:22:15,852
But by mistake they came to
your address

1226
02:22:16,394 --> 02:22:19,454
Now we will phone Jugran
and call him to the place of our choice

1227
02:22:20,131 --> 02:22:21,325
And if he wants the diamonds

1228
02:22:21,633 --> 02:22:23,362
Then he will have to tell the
name of the murderer first. Right

1229
02:22:45,089 --> 02:22:47,284
Romeo, where are you?

1230
02:22:47,659 --> 02:22:49,217
I am here Jugran

1231
02:22:50,461 --> 02:22:53,828
I have a gun in my hand
you are on its target

1232
02:22:54,465 --> 02:22:57,559
And I don't miss my aim
like your men

1233
02:22:57,769 --> 02:23:00,431
Romeo, my people didn't act
under my orders

1234
02:23:01,005 --> 02:23:02,802
They had evil intentions

1235
02:23:03,174 --> 02:23:04,698
But I swear by the devil

1236
02:23:05,009 --> 02:23:06,374
I'll abide by the deal

1237
02:23:06,778 --> 02:23:08,837
Deal will be settled from
here only Mr. Jugran

1238
02:23:09,981 --> 02:23:11,346
You tell the name of the murderer

1239
02:23:12,350 --> 02:23:13,977
I'll tell you where the
diamonds are

1240
02:23:14,552 --> 02:23:17,453
Okay, you may not
have faith in me

1241
02:23:18,556 --> 02:23:20,353
But, I have full faith in you

1242
02:23:21,259 --> 02:23:25,719
Seema's father, late Dr. Ashok Soni
was murder-

1243
02:23:26,497 --> 02:23:27,930
The man who did it-

1244
02:23:28,600 --> 02:23:29,862
That man.......

1245
02:23:33,037 --> 02:23:34,061
It's Me

1246
02:23:48,119 --> 02:23:51,111
Here I have fulfilled my promise

1247
02:24:01,799 --> 02:24:02,663
Come, come

1248
02:24:03,334 --> 02:24:05,199
You people were unnecessarily
hiding from me

1249
02:24:05,403 --> 02:24:08,736
Jugran, if you have killed
my father, then I'll....

1250
02:24:09,140 --> 02:24:11,370
I swear by the devil.
I did.

1251
02:24:12,577 --> 02:24:16,570
But, now how to ask you people,
that where the diamonds are?

1252
02:24:17,281 --> 02:24:20,045
Before coming here I found out
that this closed factory-

1253
02:24:20,218 --> 02:24:21,378
Was a chemical factory

1254
02:24:22,153 --> 02:24:24,815
Even now there are so many tanks
in this factory in which -

1255
02:24:25,556 --> 02:24:27,183
Contains Acid

1256
02:24:44,442 --> 02:24:45,875
Where are the diamonds Romeo?

1257
02:24:47,945 --> 02:24:49,173
Where are the diamonds?

1258
02:24:50,815 --> 02:24:52,373
Where are the diamonds?

1259
02:24:54,218 --> 02:24:54,741
Where are the diamonds?-

1260
02:24:54,852 --> 02:24:55,409
Stop

1261
02:25:06,130 --> 02:25:09,588
Diamonds, diamonds are
in that big box

1262
02:25:20,878 --> 02:25:23,438
Jugran Sir, he is telling the truth
diamonds are there in the bag

1263
02:25:29,454 --> 02:25:34,084
I swear by the devil. Love can
make a person do anything

1264
02:25:38,162 --> 02:25:38,821
Listen

1265
02:25:40,231 --> 02:25:43,462
Now tie this lover near his
sweet heart

1266
02:25:49,006 --> 02:25:52,601
If I wish, I can get you thrown
in this tank. But no

1267
02:25:53,945 --> 02:25:55,105
I swear by the devil

1268
02:25:56,180 --> 02:25:58,478
I won't let both of
you die so easily

1269
02:26:03,521 --> 02:26:05,751
Open very slightly

1270
02:26:12,296 --> 02:26:14,696
Acid must fall in drops

1271
02:26:17,101 --> 02:26:20,502
Slowly this acid
will gnaw the rope

1272
02:26:21,472 --> 02:26:24,236
And till then both of you will
wait for your death

1273
02:26:25,176 --> 02:26:26,370
I swear by the devil

1274
02:26:27,211 --> 02:26:31,113
Waiting for death is more
dreadful than the actual death

1275
02:26:50,434 --> 02:26:51,799
Don't look there Seema

1276
02:26:52,837 --> 02:26:55,863
Romeo, this had to be the end of us

1277
02:26:57,041 --> 02:26:59,066
Don't look there, look at me

1278
02:27:08,352 --> 02:27:11,617
There was a queen of beauty and
there was a king of thieves

1279
02:27:14,091 --> 02:27:16,389
They met each other after years

1280
02:27:20,097 --> 02:27:21,064
Good

1281
02:27:22,033 --> 02:27:25,298
But after meeting the distance
remained between them

1282
02:27:29,240 --> 02:27:30,502
Bad

1283
02:27:31,275 --> 02:27:35,507
Then they started loving each
other secretly

1284
02:27:38,416 --> 02:27:39,383
Good

1285
02:27:40,451 --> 02:27:46,083
But, they could not tell their
feelings to each other

1286
02:27:47,358 --> 02:27:48,347
Bad

1287
02:27:49,293 --> 02:27:50,885
And one day the queen of beauty

1288
02:28:02,707 --> 02:28:05,403
So what were you saying?

1289
02:28:06,210 --> 02:28:07,268
I was saying that

1290
02:28:08,779 --> 02:28:10,804
I love you very much Seema

1291
02:28:15,319 --> 02:28:16,286
Me too

1292
02:28:17,688 --> 02:28:18,518
Will you?

1293
02:28:22,860 --> 02:28:25,556
Will you
will you marry me

1294
02:28:31,235 --> 02:28:31,997
I will

1295
02:28:43,581 --> 02:28:45,572
Look there our marriage
party has come

1296
02:28:46,751 --> 02:28:51,051
Romeo, Romeo I am very much afraid

1297
02:28:57,361 --> 02:28:59,921
Nothing has happened.... till now.

1298
02:29:09,173 --> 02:29:14,076
Romeo, Romeo that rope Romeo

1299
02:29:17,515 --> 02:29:20,541
Don't look Seema,
don't look that side

1300
02:29:21,485 --> 02:29:22,782
Don't look at the
impending death

1301
02:29:22,954 --> 02:29:27,755
It is better we look at each othe
till last moment

1302
02:29:29,894 --> 02:29:35,332
Yes Romeo, I will see your face
in my eyes and die

1303
02:31:10,928 --> 02:31:14,022
Seema, Seema you wait here
here at the gate

1304
02:31:14,231 --> 02:31:15,858
May be any Jugran's
man is outside

1305
02:31:15,966 --> 02:31:17,126
I will bring the car and come

1306
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:31,807
I had told you that one day
It will be the robbers hands-

1307
02:31:33,451 --> 02:31:34,383
And my manacles

1308
02:31:35,352 --> 02:31:36,683
Today that day has come Romeo

1309
02:31:39,390 --> 02:31:42,325
I am ready to remain behind bars
for the whole of my life

1310
02:31:43,461 --> 02:31:46,157
But not today, today.....

1311
02:32:23,134 --> 02:32:23,998
No

1312
02:32:26,570 --> 02:32:28,060
Don't throw this key brother

1313
02:33:01,305 --> 02:33:02,329
Ramesh!

1314
02:33:02,940 --> 02:33:03,838
Yes brother

1315
02:33:14,418 --> 02:33:15,646
You will meet here

1316
02:33:17,388 --> 02:33:18,719
Meet this way.

1317
02:33:20,057 --> 02:33:23,925
I couldn't think brother,
I couldn't think

1318
02:33:29,300 --> 02:33:30,460
You knew it?

1319
02:33:32,570 --> 02:33:33,662
You knew it

1320
02:33:34,705 --> 02:33:38,539
Even then... naughty boy
why didn't you tell me

1321
02:33:39,143 --> 02:33:40,667
How could I brother?

1322
02:33:42,413 --> 02:33:43,937
The world of crime in which
I am........

1323
02:33:44,215 --> 02:33:46,615
If you have committed a sin, there
is an atonment for it too. fool

1324
02:33:48,085 --> 02:33:53,614
Come, first come home, touch
mother's feet and embrace sister

1325
02:33:54,758 --> 02:33:57,750
This punishment will be
your atonement

1326
02:34:00,164 --> 02:34:03,156
And... where are those
diamonds?

1327
02:34:05,603 --> 02:34:06,831
Those diamonds are
not with me.

1328
02:34:07,338 --> 02:34:08,396
Then who has them?

1329
02:34:09,773 --> 02:34:12,139
They are with the person
for whom I worked. Jugran

1330
02:34:15,913 --> 02:34:16,607
Jugran,

1331
02:34:17,014 --> 02:34:17,639
Yes

1332
02:34:23,787 --> 02:34:27,655
This sin can't be atoned
even if you go to jail

1333
02:34:28,959 --> 02:34:30,790
Idiot, fool.

1334
02:34:32,296 --> 02:34:34,526
You work for your
father's murderer

1335
02:34:40,204 --> 02:34:43,605
Jugran....Jugran

1336
02:34:43,774 --> 02:34:47,175
Yes Jugran is the murderer
of our father

1337
02:34:55,719 --> 02:35:00,281
I didn't know.... I didn't know

1338
02:35:02,226 --> 02:35:07,493
Brother, I will touch the feet
of mother and also go to Jail

1339
02:35:09,066 --> 02:35:13,093
But.... after teaching a
lesson to Jugran

1340
02:35:13,604 --> 02:35:14,969
No Romeo, I can't let you

1341
02:35:18,409 --> 02:35:20,206
I will come back brother

1342
02:35:20,511 --> 02:35:22,069
Sir, I want the arrest warrent
for Ramesh and Seema

1343
02:35:22,246 --> 02:35:23,440
They have committed this theft

1344
02:35:23,747 --> 02:35:26,875
But, now Jugran has the diamonds.
He should be in this city only

1345
02:35:27,284 --> 02:35:27,716
Alright

1346
02:35:28,619 --> 02:35:31,315
I am ready to extend any help
to you for this job

1347
02:35:31,689 --> 02:35:33,520
We want to put you on the TV
Mr. Manmohan Lal

1348
02:35:33,924 --> 02:35:35,118
Me on the TV

1349
02:35:35,426 --> 02:35:37,417
Yes Sir, so that the
public would know that-

1350
02:35:37,594 --> 02:35:39,221
The police is searching for
a person with the similar face

1351
02:35:41,832 --> 02:35:44,460
Strange.... strange

1352
02:35:46,070 --> 02:35:48,197
Police is searching
you every where

1353
02:35:48,339 --> 02:35:51,399
And you are roaming here,
very bad, very bad

1354
02:35:51,642 --> 02:35:55,009
Come I will tie you in
the bondage of love

1355
02:35:55,279 --> 02:35:56,541
Take you to the
police station

1356
02:35:56,947 --> 02:35:59,575
Don't ditch me... don't ditch me

1357
02:35:59,783 --> 02:36:03,219
We are residents of that country
where there are police stations

1358
02:36:03,387 --> 02:36:03,751
Run

1359
02:36:03,854 --> 02:36:04,843
Where there are police stations

1360
02:36:06,223 --> 02:36:12,184
What are you waiting for? catch them
catch them, don't leave them

1361
02:36:17,067 --> 02:36:23,438
I touch your feet sir.
By God I won't leave them

1362
02:36:23,974 --> 02:36:29,879
I will catch every one
I will catch every one. Dog's

1363
02:36:31,582 --> 02:36:33,948
I am not talking to you rascal

1364
02:36:34,752 --> 02:36:41,282
Dacoit.. I am coming, Dacoit
I am coming

1365
02:36:46,296 --> 02:36:47,923
Sir, now where to
look for them?

1366
02:36:49,066 --> 02:36:52,934
Now, where to look for them
I don't know where have they run away

1367
02:36:53,771 --> 02:36:56,467
Has the earth concealed them or
the sky has swallowed them

1368
02:37:06,450 --> 02:37:07,917
Seema we have escaped

1369
02:37:20,197 --> 02:37:26,193
I am sure that you will help
the police in locating him

1370
02:37:26,904 --> 02:37:27,666
Thank you

1371
02:37:28,872 --> 02:37:29,770
Seema he is

1372
02:37:30,474 --> 02:37:33,307
No Romeo, whom you are
thinking to be Jugran

1373
02:37:33,577 --> 02:37:35,306
He is his twin brother
Manmohan Lal

1374
02:37:35,546 --> 02:37:39,004
If he was Manmohan Lal then
Manmohan Lal is only Jugran

1375
02:37:39,550 --> 02:37:39,914
Why?

1376
02:37:40,584 --> 02:37:41,209
I will tell you

1377
02:37:41,852 --> 02:37:43,080
First you find out,

1378
02:37:43,487 --> 02:37:46,581
Where Manmohan Lal will be
at this moment

1379
02:37:47,057 --> 02:37:49,355
How have you suddenly decided
to go to Europe

1380
02:37:49,693 --> 02:37:51,160
I am not going for good

1381
02:37:51,829 --> 02:37:54,525
Mr. Gulshan has unnecessarily
thrown such a big farewell party

1382
02:37:54,798 --> 02:37:56,322
What are you talking
Mr. Manmohan Lal

1383
02:37:56,567 --> 02:37:59,297
This is hardly a big party in
your honour. Isn't it S.P. Sir

1384
02:45:30,887 --> 02:45:31,945
Arrest them

1385
02:45:32,122 --> 02:45:33,953
Leave me, leave me

1386
02:45:34,357 --> 02:45:35,255
Leave me

1387
02:45:35,592 --> 02:45:37,719
Romeo and Seema, we have
recognized both of you

1388
02:45:37,894 --> 02:45:40,920
S.P. Sir you have recognised us

1389
02:45:41,064 --> 02:45:43,123
But you couldn't recognize
Manmohan Lal

1390
02:45:43,300 --> 02:45:45,495
If you want to arrest,
arrest him first

1391
02:45:45,936 --> 02:45:47,767
You are saying this
for Mr. Manmohan Lal

1392
02:45:48,004 --> 02:45:49,494
The man whom you are thinking
to be Manmohan Lal-

1393
02:45:49,639 --> 02:45:50,435
Is actually Jugran

1394
02:45:50,640 --> 02:45:52,301
Yes, he is Jugran

1395
02:45:57,280 --> 02:45:59,748
I am Jugran! I am Jugran!

1396
02:46:01,785 --> 02:46:05,687
You are laughing Jugran, but
your laugh is hollow

1397
02:46:05,822 --> 02:46:10,759
Your accusations are hollow my
child because, you have no proof

1398
02:46:10,961 --> 02:46:11,757
Proof is there

1399
02:46:13,096 --> 02:46:15,257
Mark of pigeon's claws
on your wrist

1400
02:46:16,900 --> 02:46:21,803
Jango had clawed, Jugran's wrist
how did marks come on your wrist?

1401
02:46:29,913 --> 02:46:34,247
The mark of the claws, is the
last blow on your fate

1402
02:46:35,285 --> 02:46:38,254
Thorns scratched my wrist while
I was watering the garden

1403
02:46:39,222 --> 02:46:42,316
S.P sir plenty of vulgarity
has been exhibited about me

1404
02:46:45,028 --> 02:46:45,551
Wait

1405
02:46:52,002 --> 02:46:55,233
You will not clamp the manacle
on his hands

1406
02:46:58,408 --> 02:46:59,375
I will clamp them

1407
02:47:01,111 --> 02:47:04,239
Sir, I had told you, one
day it will be robbers hands-

1408
02:47:04,447 --> 02:47:05,414
And my manacles

1409
02:47:06,616 --> 02:47:07,082
Brother

1410
02:47:07,717 --> 02:47:10,754
Brother he is the murderer
of our father. He is Jugran

1411
02:47:10,754 --> 02:47:11,379
Brother?

1412
02:47:12,455 --> 02:47:15,891
Yes sir
he is my brother

1413
02:47:16,726 --> 02:47:18,660
But, at this moment he is
only a criminal

1414
02:47:19,596 --> 02:47:22,963
You are a theif, robber
a fugitive from law

1415
02:47:23,333 --> 02:47:26,734
You think that if you accuse the
honest and decent-

1416
02:47:26,903 --> 02:47:28,234
Man Mr. Manmohan Lal

1417
02:47:28,405 --> 02:47:29,497
We will concur?

1418
02:47:30,907 --> 02:47:31,236
No,

1419
02:47:31,908 --> 02:47:33,671
I think it's time for you to
go to the airport

1420
02:47:33,810 --> 02:47:36,335
Brother why don't you agree
he is the murderer of our father

1421
02:47:36,479 --> 02:47:36,911
Shut up

1422
02:47:38,081 --> 02:47:38,775
Why should I agree?

1423
02:47:39,482 --> 02:47:44,181
Why should I agree? what proof do
you have that he is Jugran

1424
02:47:44,487 --> 02:47:47,115
And what proof do you have that
he is not Jugran

1425
02:47:48,091 --> 02:47:52,357
Proof..... you will get it now

1426
02:47:53,096 --> 02:47:54,085
Mr. Khurana

1427
02:47:57,734 --> 02:47:59,759
2 persons may look identical

1428
02:48:00,036 --> 02:48:02,004
But their finger prints will
never be the same

1429
02:48:04,174 --> 02:48:05,698
You remember, that once

1430
02:48:06,076 --> 02:48:08,135
Police arrested you thinking
that you were Jugran

1431
02:48:08,711 --> 02:48:10,076
They had taken your
finger prints also

1432
02:48:10,480 --> 02:48:11,947
I have them.... excuse me

1433
02:48:12,215 --> 02:48:14,080
I got them from police records

1434
02:48:14,751 --> 02:48:17,743
I have also brought the finger
print expert, Mr. Khurana with me

1435
02:48:18,254 --> 02:48:20,415
He will take your finger prints

1436
02:48:20,623 --> 02:48:21,988
And confirm here itself

1437
02:48:22,125 --> 02:48:24,593
That both the finger prints
belong to the same person

1438
02:48:24,961 --> 02:48:25,791
And then

1439
02:48:26,196 --> 02:48:27,629
Then I will ask you people

1440
02:48:28,064 --> 02:48:31,966
That if he is Jugran then why
the finger prints are similar

1441
02:48:45,315 --> 02:48:53,484
Sir your finger prints your
finger prints, your finger prints.

1442
02:48:58,995 --> 02:48:59,484
Get away

1443
02:49:00,997 --> 02:49:01,486
What's this?

1444
02:49:02,098 --> 02:49:05,067
This is the proof sir,
that he is Jugran

1445
02:49:12,575 --> 02:49:13,303
It's empty

1446
02:49:16,913 --> 02:49:18,540
I gave you intentionally

1447
02:49:20,250 --> 02:49:22,047
These are also not Manmohan lal's
finger prints

1448
02:49:22,685 --> 02:49:25,882
The fact is that police never
took Manmohan Lal's finger print

1449
02:49:27,557 --> 02:49:31,220
Romeo you told me over the phone
that Manmohan Lal is Jugran

1450
02:49:31,728 --> 02:49:33,491
And I have proved that
he is Jugran

1451
02:49:34,063 --> 02:49:37,157
You people did half the job,
I did the other half

1452
02:49:37,367 --> 02:49:40,063
And Jugran... you are defeated

1453
02:49:45,108 --> 02:49:46,439
You are an examplary brother

1454
02:49:59,155 --> 02:50:00,417
Before congratulating each other
look there also

1455
02:50:02,692 --> 02:50:06,093
Leave me- shut up. Come

1456
02:50:07,363 --> 02:50:07,920
No....

1457
02:50:10,099 --> 02:50:10,861
Brother

1458
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,059
It is not a joke to
defeat Jugran

1459
02:50:14,837 --> 02:50:17,431
Inspector this not empty

1460
02:50:18,441 --> 02:50:21,171
Mr. S.P. girl's life
is in danger

1461
02:50:21,544 --> 02:50:24,843
That is why I tell your people
to clear the way for me to go

1462
02:50:25,915 --> 02:50:27,075
I swear by the devil

1463
02:50:27,650 --> 02:50:37,890
This should be the last
seene of this drama

1464
02:50:38,995 --> 02:50:43,989
My dear if you worship the devil
then I am dealer of death.

1465
02:50:45,501 --> 02:50:50,529
My dear give me this Gun, it is
not a play thing for childern

1466
02:50:50,940 --> 02:50:54,501
It can wound the hand

1467
02:51:02,685 --> 02:51:04,152
Tables have turned Jugran

1468
02:51:05,188 --> 02:51:08,385
Come - your end awaits you

1469
02:51:12,362 --> 02:51:16,890
Look around you

1470
02:52:14,190 --> 02:52:15,418
Come on driver, go fast

1471
02:52:15,658 --> 02:52:17,751
Romeo, Romeo there is Balwant

1472
02:52:55,031 --> 02:52:59,331
Jugran Sir, save me Jugran Sir

1473
02:52:59,469 --> 02:53:00,026
What is this?

1474
02:53:00,370 --> 02:53:02,429
Save me Jugran Sir

1475
02:53:27,630 --> 02:53:28,654
Take it up

1476
02:53:49,719 --> 02:53:53,120
Throw it throw that
container in the Sea

1477
02:53:57,560 --> 02:54:00,495
I swear by the devil. I will
do this job myself

1478
02:54:17,947 --> 02:54:20,814
Seema you don't worry
sit in the Car quickly

1479
02:54:37,667 --> 02:54:38,964
Kill both of them

1480
02:56:19,468 --> 02:56:23,461
Jugran. I have confiscated
these diamonds. Jugran

1481
02:56:29,845 --> 02:56:33,872
No Jugran you can't escape
today it's the day of justice

1482
02:56:39,355 --> 02:56:43,917
Remember every crime of yours and
every sin that you comitted

1483
02:56:44,694 --> 02:56:45,456
Remember then

1484
02:56:49,198 --> 02:56:52,258
Get up Jugran,
your game is up

1485
02:56:53,769 --> 02:56:56,670
After killing my father you have
not only snatched him-

1486
02:56:56,806 --> 02:57:00,367
But you have snatched the entire
family from me

1487
02:57:09,852 --> 02:57:13,515
Dr. Ashok Soni, do you remember him
do you remember, do you

1488
02:57:14,557 --> 02:57:16,855
Didn't you feel pity before
killing my father

1489
02:57:17,059 --> 02:57:23,726
Tell me, tell me didn't you get
mercy give me an answer, give me

1490
02:57:30,072 --> 02:57:31,198
This is the only way

1491
02:57:47,256 --> 02:57:50,054
What ever you wanted to do
you have done

1492
02:57:51,227 --> 02:57:54,458
Now it is my turn.
Now it is my turn

1493
02:58:01,370 --> 02:58:06,831
I want to see the three of you
dying from close quaters

1494
02:58:07,276 --> 02:58:09,938
You all stay there.
I will come

1495
02:58:55,958 --> 02:58:57,391
By the devil.
