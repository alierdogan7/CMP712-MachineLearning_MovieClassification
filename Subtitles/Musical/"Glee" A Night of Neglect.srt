1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:02,769
<i>
So here's what you missed
on Glee. Will's dating</i>

2
00:00:02,837 --> 00:00:04,705
<i>The hot substitute, holly
holliday. She's totally sassy</i>

3
00:00:04,772 --> 00:00:06,773
<i>And you can really see
why he's into her.
Sexy.</i>

4
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:08,508
<i>Quinn and Finn are back
together in a big way, and so</i>

5
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:10,944
<i>Is the Glee club. They did
original songs, and now they're</i>

6
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:12,713
<i>Headed to new york.
Get out! Go!</i>

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,381
<i>But sue thinks will made her
lose at nationals, and she's</i>

8
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:16,216
<i>Sort of gone over the edge,
even for her, and that's saying</i>

9
00:00:16,284 --> 00:00:18,318
<i>Something, and that's what you
missed on Glee!</i>

10
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,357
(bell ringing)

11
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:28,729
All right. We need $5,000

12
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:30,230
To pay for our trip
to nationals in new york.

13
00:00:30,298 --> 00:00:32,399
What happened to the money
that we got from the cheerios!?

14
00:00:32,467 --> 00:00:35,068
I guess sue was hiding it
in offshore accounts

15
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:36,803
In the cayman islands,
and we're having some trouble

16
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,305
Accessing some of it.

17
00:00:38,373 --> 00:00:39,740
Any of it.

18
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,811
This is salt water taffy.

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,313
Ah, I love salt water.

20
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:48,448
When I was a student here,
we paid for our entire trip

21
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:50,650
To nationals, selling this.

22
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:51,852
Classroom to classroom,

23
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:52,953
Door to door,

24
00:00:53,021 --> 00:00:55,989
We pushed this stuff like crack.

25
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:57,391
And so will we.

26
00:00:57,458 --> 00:01:00,560
So, to make $5,000

27
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:02,362
At 25 cents apiece,

28
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,632
We need to sell 20,000
pieces of taffy.

29
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,901
Wait, do you honestly think that
we can sell 20,000 anythings?

30
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:09,770
I mean, we won regionals

31
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:12,139
For the first time since
dinosaurs roamed the planet,

32
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:14,841
And I still got a freaking
cherry icee facial.

33
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,779
Oh, my god.
I'm so sorry.

34
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:19,913
Yeah.
Santana is right.

35
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:22,349
Nobody cares about us.

36
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:23,717
I can't listen to this.

37
00:01:23,785 --> 00:01:24,885
Mike, are you okay?

38
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:26,420
No.

39
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:29,356
You guys complain all the time
about being mistreated,

40
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:32,059
But you have no idea what it's
like to work your butt off

41
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:34,795
For something and have everyone,
even your friends, ignore you.

42
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:36,797
I am so trying to remember
his name right now.

43
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:39,299
Artie, tina, brittany and
I are on the brainiacs.

44
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:40,767
Isn't that the academic
decathlon team?

45
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:41,902
Wait. We have one of those?

46
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,303
Yes, we do.

47
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:45,105
<i>And the four of us went
on the smartypants show,</i>

48
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:47,641
And beat carmel high to go to
the academic decathlon finals

49
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:50,277
In detroit next week.
What? You guys were on tv?

50
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:52,179
Well, why didn't you
tell us about it?

51
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:53,713
All:
We did!

52
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:56,283
Wait, I... I get the three of
you being on the team...

53
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,952
Is it because two of them are
asian, and artie wears glasses?

54
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,155
No... But brittany?

55
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:05,058
Liz schneider was our fourth,
but she got rubella.

56
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:07,694
Her parents are hippies who
don't believe in vaccinations.

57
00:02:07,762 --> 00:02:10,063
Brittany was the only person
we could find on short notice.

58
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:12,499
<i>Artie:
We bribed her with dots.</i>

59
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:14,234
<i>That sunshine corazon</i>

60
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:16,069
<i>That rachel sent to a crack
house was on the other team.</i>

61
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:17,437
I'll take "deadly cyclones,"
please.

62
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:18,939
Right on, soul sister.

63
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:20,474
In 1970...

64
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,043
The bhola cyclone.

65
00:02:23,111 --> 00:02:24,845
Correct again.

66
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:27,414
<i>Artie: Luckily, we had
our own secret weapon.</i>

67
00:02:29,117 --> 00:02:30,550
I'll take "cat diseases."

68
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:32,085
I won't!

69
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:33,720
(audience laughing)
the first known case

70
00:02:33,788 --> 00:02:37,491
Of this disease was first
diagnosed in calcutta in 2001.

71
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:39,860
Feline aids?

72
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:41,595
(bell chiming)

73
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,163
Rod:
Correct. Bonus question.

74
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:44,731
Ringworm.

75
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:46,133
Conjunctivitis.

76
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,101
Kidney failure.

77
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,436
(applause)

78
00:02:49,504 --> 00:02:52,639
Now, on to our final
speed round question.

79
00:02:52,707 --> 00:02:55,208
Whoever buzzes in first
and answers correctly

80
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:58,545
Will win the title and go on to
our finals next week in detroit.

81
00:02:58,613 --> 00:03:02,549
Our final category,
"white rappers."

82
00:03:02,617 --> 00:03:05,185
Sadly, we can't afford to go to
the finals, so we're gonna have

83
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:07,120
To forfeit.
Why don't you just have
your parents pay for it?

84
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:09,055
Because we shouldn't have to.
We're a school club.

85
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:10,157
The school should
pay for it.

86
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:11,491
It's a matter of pride.

87
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:13,226
You guys are absolutely right.

88
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:14,928
How much do you need
to make the trip?

89
00:03:14,996 --> 00:03:16,363
With gas and motels,

90
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,033
If we only eat funyuns,
uh, $250.

91
00:03:20,101 --> 00:03:21,401
Which means...

92
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:27,240
We just need
to sell more taffy.

93
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:34,781
I'm sure you're wondering why
I called you all together here

94
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:36,583
In the dead of night,

95
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:39,386
When I'm normally out
bow-hunting for hobos.

96
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,288
Dustin goolsby,
coach of vocal adrenaline.

97
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:42,689
Sandy ryerson,

98
00:03:42,757 --> 00:03:44,925
Defrocked educator
and legendary friend of dorothy.

99
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:46,493
Terri schuester, shrew.

100
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:47,994
I'm also an assistant manager.

101
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:51,631
We all have one
very important thing in common.

102
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:54,000
We all hate will schuester.

103
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,001
I have a question.

104
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:58,471
Are you single?
Uh, I'm not gay.

105
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:02,609
I don't care. You're hunky,
and I'm what they call
"predatory gay."

106
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:04,644
I'll admit I've been on
a bit of a losing streak,

107
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:08,415
Having lost regionals, and if
will schuster wins at nationals,

108
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:10,016
My role as reigning champion

109
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:12,719
At this school will be usurped.

110
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:14,254
I'm asking you for your help.

111
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:16,790
Our mission?
To destroy the Glee club.

112
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:20,093
We'll target their fragile sense
of self-esteem

113
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:23,730
So that they implode long before
they can make it to nationals.

114
00:04:23,798 --> 00:04:24,864
And I call this union...

115
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,767
...The league of doom.

116
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:29,236
Ooh.

117
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:30,837
Okay, first of all,
that is a ridiculous name.

118
00:04:30,905 --> 00:04:32,138
And second of all,
what kind of a meeting

119
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:33,540
Doesn't have bagels
or something?

120
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:35,408
Wow, it would be hard
to be married to you.

121
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:36,876
And for the record?
Or mixed nuts...

122
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,545
I am trying to move
on with my life.

123
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:39,980
I don't hate will schuester.

124
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:41,281
But you do hate the Glee club.

125
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:43,016
That's true. I do.

126
00:04:43,084 --> 00:04:44,684
And I am looking
for a new hobby.

127
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:46,019
Henceforth, you will be known

128
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:47,621
By the following
super villain nicknames.

129
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,723
Sandy ryerson,
you are the pink dagger.

130
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,691
Yes!
You are the honey badger,

131
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,159
Nature's most ferocious animal.

132
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:54,461
Look it up on youtube.

133
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,730
Dustin goolsby?
Sergeant handsome.

134
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,532
My codename

135
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,034
Will be general Zod.
Hold up.

136
00:05:01,102 --> 00:05:03,036
I coach the winningest
Glee club in history.

137
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:05,005
We're a lock to beat mckinley
at nationals as it is.

138
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:06,539
Why would I want
to get involved in this?

139
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:08,642
Well, because, sergeant, you
strike me as a bit of a tool

140
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:11,411
Who enjoys playing mind games
with your opponents.

141
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:12,512
That's true.
I really do like doing that.

142
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,647
Legion of evil?

143
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,949
League of doom.
You can count me in.

144
00:05:16,017 --> 00:05:18,385
Although I am enjoying
my second career

145
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:20,420
As a small-time
medical marijuana dealer.

146
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:22,222
Okey-dokey.
It doesn't change the fact

147
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,957
That william took my job.

148
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:25,158
Here are your beepers.

149
00:05:25,226 --> 00:05:27,327
You will await
further instructions.

150
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:31,197
And until then,
we will be known only as...

151
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:33,500
The legion of evil.
I don't think I was listening
when you said what our name was.

152
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,668
Wait a second. Is it
"league" or "legion"?

153
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:36,169
Worst henchmen ever.

154
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,809
I missed you so
much last week.

155
00:05:42,877 --> 00:05:44,811
So what do you want
to do tomorrow night?

156
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:47,047
Whoa, there, cowboy, we haven't
even had our pizza yet.

157
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:48,782
I'm just trying
to get you when I can.

158
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:52,285
(laughs)

159
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:54,487
You know, this is actually

160
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:57,457
The first relationship
I've had where the girl

161
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:59,626
Hasn't been all over me
to spend more time with her.

162
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:00,894
Well, get used to it.

163
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,228
I'm a sub.

164
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:03,596
I'm a rolling stone.

165
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:06,032
I warned you that being in
a relationship with me meant

166
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,567
Being in a constant
state of wanting.

167
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:11,204
I am both awesome and
unavailable at the same time.

168
00:06:11,272 --> 00:06:13,540
You're kind of awesome.
(laughs)

169
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:15,108
What do you think about
my taffy sale plan

170
00:06:15,176 --> 00:06:16,509
To send the brainiacs
to detroit?

171
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:20,146
Um, I think it's
as terrible as the word

172
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:21,548
"brainiacs," but...

173
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,850
Oh, okay. Here's
your problem, all right?

174
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:26,052
You're thinking
too small, okay?

175
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,988
That crazy ex-wife of yours
messed with your brain

176
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,124
And now you think
you can't dream.

177
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:32,525
Okay. Well,
what's your idea?

178
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:35,595
A night of neglect.

179
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:37,997
That actually sounds
like life with my ex-wife.

180
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:41,101
Hilarious. No, seriously,
here's what you need to do.

181
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:42,836
Have a benefit.

182
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:46,005
You know how they do on tv when
there's, like, an earthquake,

183
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:49,843
Or they want to raise money
for, like, a sad disease.

184
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,077
That's actually
a really good idea.

185
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:52,779
I know it is.

186
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:54,781
See, your kids are feeling
really neglected, right?

187
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:56,716
So you fill the auditorium
with people who are there

188
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:58,218
To hear them sing, and poof!

189
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,653
Oh, I'm loving this.

190
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:02,756
And we can sell tickets.

191
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:05,892
And it is a perfect place
to practice for nationals.

192
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,360
And you know the best part?

193
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:09,796
We're only going to do songs
by neglected artists.

194
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:13,733
Because it's
"a night of neglect."

195
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:16,269
Can you define what you mean
by "neglected artist"?

196
00:07:16,337 --> 00:07:19,406
Um, someone whose brilliance
isn't always appreciated.

197
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:20,473
Oh, so you mean like me.

198
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,542
I mean, like all of us.

199
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,544
All right, everyone,
next Saturday night,

200
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:25,779
In our auditorium,

201
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:27,981
Mckinley high's first annual

202
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:30,850
"night of neglect" fund-raiser
benefit is officially a go!

203
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:32,085
(applause)

204
00:07:33,858 --> 00:07:35,292
(bell ringing)

205
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:36,993
Sergeant handsome,
walk with me.

206
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:39,329
I'm surprised
you even saw me.

207
00:07:39,397 --> 00:07:41,131
I was blending in
pretty well back there.

208
00:07:41,198 --> 00:07:43,133
Here's your mission. Word on
the street is that schuester

209
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,669
And that substitute
holly holliday are official.

210
00:07:45,736 --> 00:07:47,037
I need you to
break them up.

211
00:07:47,104 --> 00:07:49,406
She's looser than a
thrift store turtleneck

212
00:07:49,473 --> 00:07:51,274
And probably
just as diseased.

213
00:07:51,342 --> 00:07:52,609
Just my type.

214
00:07:52,677 --> 00:07:54,577
Psst! Ready for my
close-up, general zog.

215
00:07:54,645 --> 00:07:56,179
Sandy, how do you manage
to enter a building

216
00:07:56,247 --> 00:07:58,214
Without setting off
all the fire alarms?

217
00:07:58,282 --> 00:08:00,317
You know, I have to say, with
all this sneaking around,

218
00:08:00,384 --> 00:08:01,918
I have never
felt more alive.

219
00:08:01,986 --> 00:08:03,520
What's my assignment?

220
00:08:03,587 --> 00:08:04,821
Pink dagger, I just learned

221
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:06,623
That the Glee club
is performing a benefit concert.

222
00:08:06,691 --> 00:08:08,258
It's just
the opening we need.

223
00:08:08,326 --> 00:08:10,260
There's a student club
I want you to sponsor.

224
00:08:10,328 --> 00:08:12,128
Heckling.

225
00:08:12,196 --> 00:08:14,064
The world's
second oldest profession.

226
00:08:14,131 --> 00:08:15,165
Hell am I doing in here?

227
00:08:15,232 --> 00:08:16,232
Good. Louder.

228
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,834
In olden times,

229
00:08:17,902 --> 00:08:19,269
Hecklers provided
a needed service

230
00:08:19,337 --> 00:08:21,771
To the medieval community.
Pink dagger, if I may.

231
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:24,741
Welcome to the very first
meeting of the heckling club.

232
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:26,176
You set me up.
You told me

233
00:08:26,243 --> 00:08:27,711
I was supposed to come here
to get homework help.

234
00:08:27,778 --> 00:08:29,646
Congratulations. You're all in.

235
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:33,983
I'm really confused.

236
00:08:34,051 --> 00:08:35,685
(bell ringing)
I'm totally doing lykke li.

237
00:08:35,753 --> 00:08:37,654
She's bjork meets
florence and the machine,

238
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:39,055
And a promising new talent.

239
00:08:39,123 --> 00:08:40,390
What about you, mike?

240
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,859
The mike chang dance dance
revolution.

241
00:08:42,927 --> 00:08:44,728
I'm tired of my dancing
being overshadowed

242
00:08:44,795 --> 00:08:46,029
By all of you
guys' singing.

243
00:08:46,097 --> 00:08:48,798
It's going to be just me
and my sweet moves

244
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:50,233
On that stage.

245
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:52,736
You're forgetting about
the most neglected artist

246
00:08:52,803 --> 00:08:53,970
This Glee club's
ever seen--

247
00:08:54,038 --> 00:08:55,238
Aretha franklin.

248
00:08:55,306 --> 00:08:57,407
Neglected?
She's, like, the queen of soul.

249
00:08:57,475 --> 00:08:59,676
See, I auditioned for this club

250
00:08:59,744 --> 00:09:02,245
Singing "respect,"
and she's gotten none since.

251
00:09:02,313 --> 00:09:03,413
So I'm doing aretha.

252
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:04,414
Awesome, mercedes.

253
00:09:04,482 --> 00:09:05,849
Awesome, all of you guys.

254
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,017
Those songs are great appetizers
to my main course.

255
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:10,320
Celine dion's "my
heart will go on."

256
00:09:10,388 --> 00:09:11,454
It's gonna be our finale.

257
00:09:11,522 --> 00:09:12,789
(imitates tires screeching)

258
00:09:12,857 --> 00:09:14,624
That's like the biggest
song of all time.

259
00:09:14,692 --> 00:09:15,959
No. You don't understand.

260
00:09:16,026 --> 00:09:18,228
Celine isn't the
neglected artist, I am.

261
00:09:18,295 --> 00:09:20,630
I was kind of hoping
to do the closing number.

262
00:09:20,698 --> 00:09:23,199
Hey, you guys remember
sunshine corazon?

263
00:09:23,267 --> 00:09:24,634
You are a terrible spy.

264
00:09:24,702 --> 00:09:26,202
Seriously, with your size,

265
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,871
You easily could have stayed
in the air ducts for days.

266
00:09:27,938 --> 00:09:29,339
I'm not a spy.

267
00:09:29,407 --> 00:09:31,274
I heard about your benefit
concert on facebook,

268
00:09:31,342 --> 00:09:32,809
And I wanted to perform.

269
00:09:32,877 --> 00:09:35,612
I know what it feels like
to be in academic decathlon.

270
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:38,314
No one pays attention to you.
No one cares.

271
00:09:38,382 --> 00:09:39,983
It's not right.
We study so hard.

272
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,317
Yeah, but you're
in vocal adrenaline.

273
00:09:41,385 --> 00:09:42,552
How do we know
we can trust you?

274
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,021
Because I have nothing
against any of you.

275
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:48,525
I have 600 twitter followers.
I can get all of them to come.

276
00:09:48,592 --> 00:09:49,959
How many tickets
have we sold so far?

277
00:09:50,027 --> 00:09:52,228
Four. No one's interested.
It's just sad.

278
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:54,998
Please, just let me
show you what I can do.

279
00:09:55,065 --> 00:09:57,300
I would like to sing
the perfect song about neglect,

280
00:09:57,368 --> 00:09:58,635
"all by myself."

281
00:09:58,702 --> 00:10:00,570
I'm such a better singer
than everyone else,

282
00:10:00,638 --> 00:10:02,205
So I know how it feels.

283
00:10:02,273 --> 00:10:04,507
I'm all alone at the top.

284
00:10:04,575 --> 00:10:07,610
Also, I'm really short. So even
when I'm in a group of people,

285
00:10:07,678 --> 00:10:09,712
It feels like I'm wandering
alone through a forest.

286
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,115
There's no way that she's
singing in our auditorium, okay?

287
00:10:12,183 --> 00:10:13,650
She's the enemy.

288
00:10:13,717 --> 00:10:16,886
I say we give her a chance. I
mean, you owe her, rachel.

289
00:10:16,954 --> 00:10:19,456
You sent her to a
frickin' crack house.

290
00:10:19,523 --> 00:10:21,591

So, can I perform with you guys?

315
00:12:33,891 --> 00:12:35,191
Absolutely not.
She's just trying

316
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:37,493
To get on our good sides
so she can spy on us.

317
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:38,895
You're one to talk. We told you

318
00:12:38,963 --> 00:12:41,397
The same thing
about jesse st. James last year.

319
00:12:41,465 --> 00:12:42,899
And you were right!
Finn:
This whole thing

320
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:44,867
Isn't about us. It's about
helping the brainiacs.

321
00:12:44,935 --> 00:12:46,235
Puck:
Yeah, we need sunshine's

322
00:12:46,303 --> 00:12:47,770
Twitter followers to
come and pay for tickets,

323
00:12:47,838 --> 00:12:49,572
Or there's no point in
having a benefit at all.

324
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,707
(sighs)

325
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:55,111
Fine. Mercedes,
you're okay with being bumped

326
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:56,779
To the decidedly less glamorous
middle spot.

327
00:12:56,847 --> 00:12:57,981
Right?

328
00:12:58,048 --> 00:13:00,883
Um... Sure, I guess.

329
00:13:03,053 --> 00:13:05,321
Absolutely.

330
00:13:10,094 --> 00:13:11,794
(school bell ringing)

331
00:13:11,862 --> 00:13:13,763
Hey, mercedes, can
I have your shoes?

332
00:13:13,831 --> 00:13:17,433
I promise to give you a dirty
pair of my flip-flops in return.

333
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:19,135
Do you know how hard it is

334
00:13:19,203 --> 00:13:20,837
To find high-top, yellow
patent leather sneakers?

335
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:22,372
Really? I'm surprised

336
00:13:22,439 --> 00:13:24,474
You didn't just give them
to me, considering

337
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,775
How little you
think of yourself.

338
00:13:25,843 --> 00:13:27,910
You're the most talented singer
in Glee club,

339
00:13:27,978 --> 00:13:30,113
Yet you're constantly taking
the backseat to everyone.

340
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,115
Well, what am I supposed to do?

341
00:13:32,182 --> 00:13:34,450
I'm-I'm tired of fighting
with rachel all the time.

342
00:13:34,518 --> 00:13:37,520
Okay, you're always singing
about r-e-s-p-e-c-t,

343
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:39,522
But respect isn't something
you can ask for.

344
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,857
You have to demand it.

345
00:13:40,924 --> 00:13:42,458
And you deserve it.

346
00:13:42,526 --> 00:13:44,527
You don't seem to have trouble
in that department.
Right.

347
00:13:44,595 --> 00:13:46,062
You know what?

348
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,698
Neither does aretha
or j-lo or mariah.

349
00:13:48,766 --> 00:13:51,200
You know why? Because
they get proof every day.

350
00:13:51,268 --> 00:13:53,736
I heard mariah
makes appointments at 9:00 a.M.,

351
00:13:53,804 --> 00:13:55,938
And shows up at 4:00
in the afternoon

352
00:13:56,006 --> 00:13:58,775
Because she knows
people will wait.

353
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:01,077
But those kinds
of demands are ridiculous.

354
00:14:01,145 --> 00:14:02,912
Exactly. But once
you see that no matter

355
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,781
How ridiculous your demands,
people will meet them,

356
00:14:04,848 --> 00:14:06,249
You know
you have it.
Have what?

357
00:14:06,316 --> 00:14:09,786
Respect. And as your manager,

358
00:14:09,853 --> 00:14:11,120
I'd say you're
thinking too small.

359
00:14:11,188 --> 00:14:13,156
Wait a minute.
Since when are you my manager?

360
00:14:13,223 --> 00:14:15,191
Since you agreed to
give me ten percent

361
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:17,927
Of whatever we can come
up with to ask for.

362
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,131
Sister, you got yourself a deal.

363
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,822
(whirring)

364
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,628
Are you okay?

365
00:14:31,696 --> 00:14:34,297
Yup. I will be as soon
as this counter's really clean.

366
00:14:36,134 --> 00:14:38,835
I hear that ocd symptoms
tend to get worse

367
00:14:38,903 --> 00:14:40,737
When the person
is under great stress.

368
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,441
(sniffles)

369
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,009
Carl's gone.

370
00:14:50,548 --> 00:14:52,616
He asked for an annulment,

371
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,819
Which I guess

372
00:14:55,887 --> 00:14:57,387
He's legally entitled to,

373
00:14:57,455 --> 00:15:00,190
Considering we never actually
consummated the marriage.

374
00:15:00,258 --> 00:15:01,158
You guys never...?

375
00:15:05,229 --> 00:15:06,730
At what age are you allowed

376
00:15:06,798 --> 00:15:09,733
To look back on your life
with nothing but regret?

377
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:11,201
Is 32 too young?

378
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,909
I actually believed

379
00:15:18,976 --> 00:15:21,344
That I'd have a handle
on my ocd by now.

380
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:27,217
It's just been so long, and...

381
00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:29,119
I'm so tired.

382
00:15:34,525 --> 00:15:36,526
This your lunch?

383
00:15:36,594 --> 00:15:38,695
Yeah.

384
00:15:45,503 --> 00:15:47,370
What are you doing?

385
00:15:50,374 --> 00:15:53,443
One day, you're going to find
a way to beat this thing.

386
00:15:53,511 --> 00:15:55,011
Until then,

387
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,581
I'm here for you.

388
00:15:57,648 --> 00:15:59,015
No judgment.

389
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,118
Just...

390
00:16:01,185 --> 00:16:02,986
A friend that you can count on.

391
00:16:05,523 --> 00:16:07,657
Cheers.

392
00:16:13,865 --> 00:16:15,332
(school bell ringing)
Finn:
So, uh, the braniacs

393
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:18,235
Asked us to be benefit heads
for the night of neglect.

394
00:16:18,302 --> 00:16:19,669
Quinn:
And we would like to select you

395
00:16:19,737 --> 00:16:21,004
Head of talent relations.

396
00:16:21,072 --> 00:16:22,305
We figured
you're probably used to relating

397
00:16:22,373 --> 00:16:24,274
To talent
because you're so talented.

398
00:16:24,342 --> 00:16:27,010
Well, first, I'm honored
that you came to me,

399
00:16:27,078 --> 00:16:29,546
But I think it's a little
insensitive of you to be

400
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,615
Flaunting your
dating in my face.
Fantastic.

401
00:16:31,682 --> 00:16:34,618
'cause we are having problems
with one of our performers.

402
00:16:34,685 --> 00:16:36,786
A) I need a bowl of green m&Ms.

403
00:16:36,854 --> 00:16:39,389
And by bowl, I mean large bowl.
Well, really a small barrel.

404
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:40,590
O... Kay.

405
00:16:40,658 --> 00:16:41,992
Two) I need humidifiers.

406
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:45,028
Lots of humidifiers.
A team of humidifiers

407
00:16:45,096 --> 00:16:46,630
Whose only job is to make

408
00:16:46,697 --> 00:16:48,331
The air that mercedes
breathes more humid.

409
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,667
We'll try our best.
Shh. I'm not finished.

410
00:16:50,735 --> 00:16:53,336
Before every performance,
I like to wash my hands.

411
00:16:53,404 --> 00:16:56,940
And after doing so, I like to
dry them on a fresh puppy.

412
00:16:57,008 --> 00:16:59,109
Excuse me?
I believe you heard Ms. Jones.

413
00:16:59,177 --> 00:17:01,111
In fact, if I were you, I'd
probably get a whole litter

414
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:03,180
Of fluffy puppies, just in case
she decides

415
00:17:03,247 --> 00:17:05,382
To take a post-show shower.

416
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:06,516
Stars make demands
the way that babies

417
00:17:06,584 --> 00:17:07,751
Make messes in their diapers.

418
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,452
They can't help it.
What a star wants is

419
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,154
To just feel appreciated
and respected.

420
00:17:11,222 --> 00:17:13,323
They just want to feel
like they're being heard.

421
00:17:13,391 --> 00:17:15,058
She seemed pretty serious
about the puppy.

422
00:17:15,126 --> 00:17:17,928
Well, obviously, hers is a
talent that we have neglected.

423
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,229
I can relate.

424
00:17:19,297 --> 00:17:21,665
So leave it to me.
I'll take care of it.

425
00:17:24,235 --> 00:17:25,569
(british accent):
Hello, class.

426
00:17:25,636 --> 00:17:27,637
I am the world's most famous
and stylish divorcee

427
00:17:27,705 --> 00:17:30,006
Wallace simpson.

428
00:17:30,074 --> 00:17:32,809
I was married a bunch of times,
and then I fell in love

429
00:17:32,877 --> 00:17:35,245
With edward viii and made him
abdicate the throne.

430
00:17:35,313 --> 00:17:39,749
I had giant hands,
so a lot of people thought

431
00:17:39,817 --> 00:17:42,552
I was a hermaphrodite, but
that wasn't true. Others said

432
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,287
I was a nazi sympathizer.

433
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:45,822
<i>That was true.</i>

434
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,391
Boy, did I think
that hitler showed promise!

435
00:17:48,459 --> 00:17:49,993
(bell rings)
(normal voice):
Tomorrow we're gonna do

436
00:17:50,061 --> 00:17:53,663
Catherine the great and her pet
stallion fred, so come early.

437
00:17:57,235 --> 00:17:59,202
We haven't been
introduced.

438
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,438
I'm dustin goolsby,
coach of vocal adrenaline.

439
00:18:01,505 --> 00:18:03,206
Oh.

440
00:18:03,274 --> 00:18:04,975
So you're the big
competition at nationals.

441
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,444
Well, thank you very much
for volunteering your star

442
00:18:07,511 --> 00:18:09,946
For our night
of neglect benefit.

443
00:18:10,014 --> 00:18:12,649
What are you talking about?
I never approved that.

444
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:16,486
Let me cut to
the sexy chase.

445
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,054
Think about how
many more years

446
00:18:18,122 --> 00:18:19,522
You have left of
productive ovulating.

447
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,359
Those aren't eggs in
those fallopian tubes.

448
00:18:22,426 --> 00:18:24,394
They're rare,
exotic pearls.

449
00:18:24,462 --> 00:18:26,963
Oh. So you're trying
to seduce me.

450
00:18:27,031 --> 00:18:28,999
Jackpot. This hairline
is 85% my own,

451
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,034
And my sperm count
is off the charts.

452
00:18:31,102 --> 00:18:32,636
Well... (laughs)

453
00:18:32,703 --> 00:18:35,972
...As tempting as that sounds,
I have a boyfriend.

454
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,274
Yeah, you do now.

455
00:18:37,341 --> 00:18:39,476
Admit it.
I'm handsome,

456
00:18:39,543 --> 00:18:41,478
I'm good-looking, and
I'm easy on the eyes.

457
00:18:41,545 --> 00:18:43,313
Also, I'm gorgeous.

458
00:18:43,381 --> 00:18:46,916
And I'm dating
will schuester.

459
00:18:46,984 --> 00:18:48,251
Let me tell you something
about will schuester.

460
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,986
That guy has
tiny baby hands.

461
00:18:50,054 --> 00:18:52,022
Seriously. It's weird.

462
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,091
Once I saw him try to pick up a
big mac, and he couldn't do it.

463
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:56,526
He had to eat it
layer by layer.

464
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,895
Teeny, tiny, wee

465
00:18:58,963 --> 00:19:00,163
Baby hands.

466
00:19:00,231 --> 00:19:03,199
That are big enough
to knock your teeth out.

467
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,801
Well, this is awkward.

468
00:19:06,537 --> 00:19:08,571
Consider my offer.

469
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:11,975
What offer?

470
00:19:12,043 --> 00:19:13,310
He was just
hitting on me.

471
00:19:13,377 --> 00:19:15,211
Isn't that silly?

472
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,115
What's wrong?

473
00:19:19,183 --> 00:19:21,418
Well, we were supposed to have
lunch, and you don't show.

474
00:19:21,485 --> 00:19:23,853
And now you're getting hit on
by the coach of our archrival.

475
00:19:23,921 --> 00:19:25,655
How is that my fault?

476
00:19:25,723 --> 00:19:27,624
And by the way, I did
show up for lunch,

477
00:19:27,692 --> 00:19:29,092
And you looked like
you were actually having

478
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,194
A pretty good time.

479
00:19:31,262 --> 00:19:34,164
I kind of felt
like I was intruding, so...

480
00:19:34,231 --> 00:19:35,632
Oh, man. I am...

481
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,434
I am not the jealous type, will.

482
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:39,336
Neither am I.

483
00:19:39,403 --> 00:19:43,373
Look, how about instead
of a pointless argument,

484
00:19:43,441 --> 00:19:45,775
We rehearse our duet
for the benefit?

485
00:19:45,843 --> 00:19:49,679
I really don't, uh, feel in the
mood to do a duet right now.

486
00:19:51,248 --> 00:19:53,550
I think I just have
to clear my head.

487
00:19:56,253 --> 00:19:59,055
Uh, no problem.

488
00:20:02,026 --> 00:20:04,394
I'll see you at the benefit.

489
00:20:06,397 --> 00:20:09,532
(school bell ringing)

490
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,801
Well, as you can see,
we have followed

491
00:20:11,869 --> 00:20:14,137
Your exact specifications.

492
00:20:14,205 --> 00:20:16,072
Wait, where's my puppy?

493
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,674
She specifically
asked for a puppy.

494
00:20:17,742 --> 00:20:19,509
Mercedes:
This is unbelievable.

495
00:20:19,577 --> 00:20:22,178
How am I supposed
to work like this?
Don't worry. Puckerman is

496
00:20:22,246 --> 00:20:25,415
Out right now scouring pounds
for the perfect pomeranian.

497
00:20:25,483 --> 00:20:27,417
Good. This is almost
worthy of the artist

498
00:20:27,485 --> 00:20:29,486
Doing the closing
number at the benefit.

499
00:20:29,553 --> 00:20:32,021
Well, actually, um, sunshine

500
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:34,357
Is going to be doing
the last number, because

501
00:20:34,425 --> 00:20:36,126
She's bringing in hundreds
of people.

502
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,061
And so, I'll go on

503
00:20:38,129 --> 00:20:39,796
Before sunshine
because, I'm, well, me,

504
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:43,166
And, uh, Ms. Holliday and
mercedes will go on before me.

505
00:20:43,234 --> 00:20:44,634
Fine.

506
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,871
But Ms. Jones isn't
happy about it.

507
00:20:47,938 --> 00:20:49,205
In exchange, she's demanding

508
00:20:49,273 --> 00:20:51,341
That during the day
of the benefit, her feet

509
00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:53,476
Never touch
the ground.
Excuse me?

510
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,412
Oh, did you not see
celine's wedding?
Carried in.

511
00:20:55,479 --> 00:20:56,679
Cher's comeback tour?
Carried in.

512
00:20:56,747 --> 00:20:57,847
Gaga at the grammys?

513
00:20:57,915 --> 00:20:59,749
Carried the hell in.

514
00:20:59,817 --> 00:21:01,418
Um, I'm sorry. Are-are

515
00:21:01,485 --> 00:21:04,754
You saying that you want to be
carried in in a giant egg?

516
00:21:07,758 --> 00:21:09,726
We'll get back to you.

517
00:21:12,288 --> 00:21:13,689
And that was
the spanish classroom.

518
00:21:13,757 --> 00:21:15,624
And of course,
you know the choir room.

519
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:17,059
Brittany:
Hey, you guys, you better

520
00:21:17,127 --> 00:21:18,661
Get in the auditorium.
The show's about to start.

521
00:21:18,728 --> 00:21:19,995
It's going to be a
full house, ya'll.

522
00:21:20,063 --> 00:21:21,797
Got to get there early
to get a good seat.

523
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:23,699
We'll be there in a minute.
I'm just showing blaine around.

524
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:25,234
Thanks for coming and
supporting us, guys.

525
00:21:25,301 --> 00:21:26,368
It's really cool.

526
00:21:26,436 --> 00:21:27,569
Bye.

527
00:21:30,106 --> 00:21:31,707
Oh, you miss them.

528
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:34,743
What the hell
are you two doing here?

529
00:21:34,811 --> 00:21:36,245
We're here for the benefit.
Don't tell me you're going.

530
00:21:36,312 --> 00:21:37,579
I wouldn't be caught dead.

531
00:21:37,647 --> 00:21:39,448
I was pumping iron
in the gym,

532
00:21:39,516 --> 00:21:41,083
And one of the guys told me
you two were here

533
00:21:41,151 --> 00:21:42,785
Spreading your fairy dust
all over the place.

534
00:21:42,852 --> 00:21:44,286
Would you just give it up?

535
00:21:44,354 --> 00:21:46,121
You can live whatever lie
you want, but don't pretend

536
00:21:46,189 --> 00:21:47,723
The three of us don't know
what's really going on here.

537
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,525
You don't know squat, butt boy.

538
00:21:49,592 --> 00:21:52,461
Hey, no, guys, stop!
Real brave with your fists,

539
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:54,496
But you're a coward when
it comes to the truth.

540
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:57,366
Truth about what?
It's none
of your business, j.Lo.

541
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,203
First of all, anything
you do became my business

542
00:22:01,271 --> 00:22:04,106
When you decided to toss
that slushee up in my grill.

543
00:22:04,174 --> 00:22:06,542
I think I can take a couple
of queers and a girl.

544
00:22:06,609 --> 00:22:08,711
(chuckles)
okay.

545
00:22:08,778 --> 00:22:10,079
See, here's what's gonna
go down. Two choices.

546
00:22:10,146 --> 00:22:12,514
You stay here,
and I crack one of your nuts--

547
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:15,551
Right or left, that's your
choice-- or you walk away,

548
00:22:15,618 --> 00:22:17,286
And live to be a
douchebag another day.

549
00:22:17,353 --> 00:22:20,556
Oh, and also, I have
razorblades hidden in my hair.

550
00:22:20,623 --> 00:22:21,890
Mm-hmm. Tons.

551
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:23,692
Just all up in there.

552
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,894
Mm-hmm.

553
00:22:25,962 --> 00:22:26,995
We could have
handled that.

554
00:22:27,063 --> 00:22:29,131
It was more fun
doing it together.

555
00:22:29,199 --> 00:22:30,265
(phone vibrates)

556
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:33,335

00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,144
She's not coming, and neither
are any of her followers.

562
00:22:42,212 --> 00:22:43,912
I told you. She's evil.

563
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,980
I was just in the auditorium.

564
00:22:45,048 --> 00:22:46,348
There's, like,
six people in there.

565
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:47,950
I say we blow this whole thing
off and hit the arcade.

566
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:52,221
No. No. Screw that.

567
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,490
These people paid
to see us sing.

568
00:22:54,557 --> 00:22:55,991
What's that saying?

569
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:58,527
The show's got to go all over
the place or something.

570
00:22:58,595 --> 00:23:00,229
You mean, "the show must go on."
yeah.

571
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:01,663
Finn's right, you guys.

572
00:23:01,731 --> 00:23:03,432
Okay, whether there's
six or 6,000 people,

573
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,467
Out there, we still have
to give it our all.

in my entire life.

00:24:12,902 --> 00:24:14,336
I didn't think
it was possible

599
00:24:14,404 --> 00:24:15,504
For people to
hate us even more.

600
00:24:15,572 --> 00:24:16,905
We're calling this off.

601
00:24:16,973 --> 00:24:20,075
Guys, I hate to say it,
but I think we have to buck up.

602
00:24:20,143 --> 00:24:22,311
Tina, I'm sorry you had
to go through that,

603
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,179
But it's actually a really good
lesson for us.

604
00:24:24,247 --> 00:24:26,515
I mean, that's
a part of show business, guys.

605
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:27,983
Sometimes people
can be really mean.

606
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:29,685
Think about
what's going to happen

607
00:24:29,752 --> 00:24:31,620
If we have an unfriendly crowd
at nationals in new york.

608
00:24:31,688 --> 00:24:33,155
And I'm sure there's going

609
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:34,857
To be some vocal adrenaline
hecklers there, too.

610
00:24:34,924 --> 00:24:37,860
We need to find some strength
and barrel through this.

611
00:24:37,927 --> 00:24:40,329
I think I may know a way
to shut those hecklers up

612
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:41,597
For a number or two.

613
00:24:41,664 --> 00:24:43,966

as you want.

club loved our refreshments.

Yeah, but we're almost
out of that taffy.

00:26:45,154 --> 00:26:46,455
How are we going to keep them

660
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:47,889
From going after us again
after the intermission?

661
00:26:47,957 --> 00:26:49,891

that they can't heckle us.

The way she's been treated

667
00:26:58,935 --> 00:27:00,469
And is refusing to go on.

668
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,604
(sighs)
let me talk to her.

669
00:27:02,672 --> 00:27:06,575
Don't bother. Mercedes
has left the building.

670
00:27:07,977 --> 00:27:09,511
Okay, you guys,
go find mercedes.

671
00:27:09,579 --> 00:27:11,279

673
00:27:18,622 --> 00:27:19,989
Oh, no. Not at all.

674
00:27:20,057 --> 00:27:22,058
I was just taking the
opportunity of intermission

675
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:23,860
To tell you guys
what great hecklers you are.

676
00:27:23,927 --> 00:27:26,195
You must practice a lot.

677
00:27:26,263 --> 00:27:28,764
No, not that much.
Just on the internet only.

You're kidding.
I've never seen you on there.

680
00:27:34,171 --> 00:27:38,541
You wouldn't. Because I post as
"ncisucks" or "ncistupid."

684
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:49,919
Technology has allowed us
to be brutally cruel

685
00:27:49,987 --> 00:27:51,354
Without suffering
any consequences.

686
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:53,356
In the past, if I wanted to tell
someone they sucked,

687
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:54,757
I'd have to say it
to their face,

688
00:27:54,825 --> 00:27:56,459
Which would usually result

689
00:27:56,527 --> 00:27:58,094
In them kicking
me in the groin.

690
00:27:58,161 --> 00:28:01,130
I get it. We live
in a culture of insults.

691
00:28:01,198 --> 00:28:03,633
I mean, we're constantly
bombarded with these

692
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:07,103
Images of people who are richer
than us, and happier than us,

693
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:09,972
And have more interesting
sex than us, and it
makes us feel terrible.

694
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,440
Preach.

695
00:28:11,508 --> 00:28:14,143
You know, we tear them down
to feel better about ourselves.

696
00:28:14,211 --> 00:28:16,178
And we don't just stop
with the people who are on tv

697
00:28:16,246 --> 00:28:17,813
Or in magazines,
we do it to everybody.

698
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:20,616
And we think that because
it's done anonymously,

699
00:28:20,684 --> 00:28:23,686
There are no ramifications.

700
00:28:23,754 --> 00:28:25,888
But there are ramifications,
guys.

701
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:28,824
Because it makes you comfortable
with insensitivity.

702
00:28:28,892 --> 00:28:31,127
Do you know that one of
the girls you heckled tonight

703
00:28:31,194 --> 00:28:33,229
Has been crying for an hour?

704
00:28:35,098 --> 00:28:36,666
Are you saying
you never ragged on anybody?

705
00:28:36,733 --> 00:28:38,935
Oh, of course I did.
I spent three years

706
00:28:39,002 --> 00:28:40,703
Sending hate mail
to debbie gibson

707
00:28:40,771 --> 00:28:42,638
Until she wrote
me back and said

708
00:28:42,706 --> 00:28:44,774
That the stress of my letters
was giving her alopecia.

709
00:28:44,841 --> 00:28:46,042
And then I felt terrible

710
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:48,377
Because I realized
it was just my jealousy

711
00:28:48,445 --> 00:28:51,347
That she could fill a mall
with her adoring fans.

712
00:28:51,415 --> 00:28:52,815
You guys are great kids.

713
00:28:52,883 --> 00:28:56,552
Some of those insults were rad.

714
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,455
But just think about how
you could lift up the world

715
00:28:59,523 --> 00:29:01,557
If you turned some
of those barbs into roses.

716
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:04,427
I mean, intermission's almost
over. Why don't you get back

717
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:07,563
In there and turn some of that
jeering into cheering?

718
00:29:09,566 --> 00:29:12,034
Na, no. I think
I'm just going to go home,

719
00:29:12,102 --> 00:29:15,304
Probably do a new post about
how handsome mark harmon is.

720
00:29:15,372 --> 00:29:16,839
Me, too. I'm out.

721
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,375
I'm splitting, too.

722
00:29:19,443 --> 00:29:21,444
They say, "if you have nothing
nice to say..."

723
00:29:24,348 --> 00:29:26,148
I'll be 18 in three years.

724
00:29:26,216 --> 00:29:27,583
Wait for me?

725
00:29:28,785 --> 00:29:30,720
Let me in. Let me in.

726
00:29:30,787 --> 00:29:32,622
Come on. It's raining.

727
00:29:34,191 --> 00:29:36,292
We've all been
looking for you.

728
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,961
Don't bother with the pep talk.
I'm not going back in there.

729
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:40,329
My demands were not met.

730
00:29:40,397 --> 00:29:42,231
Have you ever read anything
about aretha franklin?

731
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,834
She was a gospel singer.

732
00:29:44,901 --> 00:29:47,703
And one day, she went
to this-this show.

733
00:29:47,771 --> 00:29:50,106
Nothing fancy. It was
just, like, a state fair.

734
00:29:50,173 --> 00:29:51,741
And the master
of ceremonies

735
00:29:51,808 --> 00:29:54,910
Hands her a tiara and calls
her the queen of soul.

736
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,414
And that's
how she earned her crown.

737
00:29:58,482 --> 00:30:00,616
That's how she gained
all of her respect.

738
00:30:00,684 --> 00:30:03,419
Not by-by requesting
for special pillows,

739
00:30:03,487 --> 00:30:05,621
Or-or food, but...

740
00:30:05,689 --> 00:30:08,290
For doing what she does best:
Singing.

741
00:30:08,358 --> 00:30:10,960
I just don't get it.

742
00:30:11,028 --> 00:30:12,828
Why are you
a bigger star than me?

743
00:30:14,164 --> 00:30:16,799
You always get
the big solos,

744
00:30:16,867 --> 00:30:19,435
The best songs,
the moments in the sun.

745
00:30:19,503 --> 00:30:22,138
Why is it never me?

746
00:30:22,205 --> 00:30:24,674
I don't know.

747
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:29,378
I mean, you're just as good
of a singer as I am.

748
00:30:29,446 --> 00:30:31,147
Yeah.
And everyone actually likes me.

749
00:30:31,214 --> 00:30:32,481
That's your problem.

750
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:34,950
Because I would rather
be a star than be liked.

751
00:30:35,018 --> 00:30:36,318
And-and...

752
00:30:36,386 --> 00:30:38,354
I'm not saying
that it's healthy,

753
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:40,289
And I'm not saying that it's
better than being loved,

754
00:30:40,357 --> 00:30:43,225
But there's nothing--

755
00:30:43,293 --> 00:30:45,327
<i>Nothing-- that I wouldn't do</i>

756
00:30:45,395 --> 00:30:47,396
For the chance
to be in the spotlight.

757
00:30:47,464 --> 00:30:48,964
I just...

758
00:30:49,032 --> 00:30:51,867
Really wanted that closing slot.

759
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:54,804
Well, if you want
that closing slot,

760
00:30:54,871 --> 00:30:59,175
Then go in there
and take it from me.

761
00:31:02,612 --> 00:31:05,381
Where is everybody?
Let's get on with it.

762
00:31:05,449 --> 00:31:07,516
You're a really horrible
person, you know that?

763
00:31:07,584 --> 00:31:10,653
You sound like my
court-appointed therapist.

764
00:31:10,721 --> 00:31:13,589
Pink dagger, I'm going to need
to speak with you right now.

765
00:31:13,657 --> 00:31:14,924
Yes, general.

766
00:31:14,991 --> 00:31:17,259
You know, I had a feeling
you might be behind this.

767
00:31:17,327 --> 00:31:19,562
You have no proof.

768
00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:22,098
(sighs)

769
00:31:22,165 --> 00:31:24,366
Sam:
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

770
00:31:24,434 --> 00:31:26,869
Miss holly holliday.

771

Sandy, I just saw
Jacob ben israel, azimio

809
00:34:20,754 --> 00:34:23,756
And becky jackson leave the
benefit they were supposed to be

810
00:34:23,824 --> 00:34:26,726
Ruining together in a car with
the license plate "jewfro."

811
00:34:26,793 --> 00:34:28,461
I lost track of 'em.

812
00:34:28,528 --> 00:34:31,364
I went into the bathroom,
when I came out, they were gone.

813
00:34:31,431 --> 00:34:33,232
I was applying
a light coat of powder

814
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,500
And practicing catch phrases

815
00:34:34,568 --> 00:34:36,902
To use when I really
take someone down a peg.

816
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:38,704
Like?

817
00:34:38,772 --> 00:34:41,273
You just got poked.

818
00:34:41,341 --> 00:34:43,576
Poked by the dagger!

819
00:34:45,145 --> 00:34:47,413
Your job was to
crush their spirit,

820
00:34:47,481 --> 00:34:49,615
And had you done
that, they would have

821
00:34:49,683 --> 00:34:50,983
Closed up shop
by intermission.

822
00:34:51,051 --> 00:34:53,052
Now get back in
there and question

823
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,554
The whole purpose
of arts education.

824
00:34:55,622 --> 00:34:57,123
I'm getting back in there.

825
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:00,760
That Glee club's not
gonna know what hit 'em!

826
00:35:00,827 --> 00:35:02,862
I tried,
but I don't think she's coming.

827
00:35:02,929 --> 00:35:05,831
I need to start warming up.

828
00:35:05,899 --> 00:35:07,500
Lauren, you're her manager.

829
00:35:07,567 --> 00:35:09,135
Why don't you do something?

830
00:35:09,202 --> 00:35:11,837
See, my client, Ms. Jones,
is not picking up her phone.

831
00:35:11,905 --> 00:35:13,105
Oh.
So... (clears throat)

832
00:35:13,173 --> 00:35:14,640
Miss jones is fine.

833
00:35:14,708 --> 00:35:17,476
Wait. Shouldn't one of us
be carrying you in?

834
00:35:17,544 --> 00:35:18,978
(scoffs)

835
00:35:19,046 --> 00:35:21,447
I have only one
more demand.

836
00:35:21,515 --> 00:35:23,883
I demand

837
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:27,253
That all of you get your butts
out there and watch me sing.

838
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,287
(cheering,
overlapping chatter)

839
00:35:28,355 --> 00:35:29,588
Hallelujah!

840
00:35:29,656 --> 00:35:30,923
You heard the woman.
Let's go.

841
00:35:30,991 --> 00:35:32,491
(overlapping chatter)

842
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:36,495
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
Ms. Mercedes jones.

(applause, cheering
and shouting)

890
00:38:38,945 --> 00:38:40,846
Oh.

891
00:38:40,914 --> 00:38:42,948
All right, girl,
time for the closing number.

892
00:38:43,016 --> 00:38:44,283
Go bring the house down.

893
00:38:44,351 --> 00:38:46,285
Are you kidding me?

894
00:38:46,353 --> 00:38:47,987
Nobody could follow that.

895
00:38:48,054 --> 00:38:50,422
Okay, the house has been
brought down.

896
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:52,558
<i>That was the closing number.</i>

897
00:38:56,263 --> 00:38:58,564
(speaking french)

898
00:38:58,632 --> 00:39:00,532
Bye. Hey, hot stuff.

899
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,035
Hey.
How are the kids doing?

900
00:39:03,103 --> 00:39:05,237
They were amazeballs
tonight, right?
Yeah, they're good.

901
00:39:05,305 --> 00:39:08,073
Everyone's in the choir room,
and they all want to thank you

902
00:39:08,141 --> 00:39:10,409
For helping out with the benefit
and the hecklers and...

903
00:39:10,477 --> 00:39:13,145
Why were you in the janitor's
closet with the door closed?

904
00:39:13,213 --> 00:39:14,446
Okay, 'cause I'm a sub,

905
00:39:14,514 --> 00:39:16,382
And that's the office
that figgins gives me.

906
00:39:16,449 --> 00:39:18,317
Guess what?

907
00:39:18,385 --> 00:39:21,253
I just got offered a job
to teach french in cleveland.

908
00:39:21,321 --> 00:39:23,489
Isn't that great?

909
00:39:23,556 --> 00:39:25,658
Full time?

910
00:39:25,725 --> 00:39:27,993
No. Who are you talking to?
Four months, tops.

911
00:39:28,061 --> 00:39:30,763
Don't you have any feelings
about leaving?

912
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,731
Didn't you listen to my song?

913
00:39:32,799 --> 00:39:33,966
I told you, will.

914
00:39:34,034 --> 00:39:35,401
I live the glamorous life

915
00:39:35,468 --> 00:39:37,169
Of a substitute teacher,

916
00:39:37,237 --> 00:39:38,871
And I'm deathly allergic
to commitment.

917
00:39:38,938 --> 00:39:41,173
You knew that this
was going to end this way.

918
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:45,944
Yeah.

919
00:39:46,012 --> 00:39:47,913
Doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.

920
00:39:47,981 --> 00:39:49,948
You're too nice for me.

921
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,784
But you broke my record.

922
00:39:51,851 --> 00:39:53,419
Five dates.

923
00:39:53,486 --> 00:39:54,853
Are you counting that one

924
00:39:54,921 --> 00:39:56,588
We had in the janitor's
closet yesterday?

925
00:39:56,656 --> 00:39:58,924
That was my favorite one.

926
00:39:58,992 --> 00:40:00,893
Mine, too.

927
00:40:02,996 --> 00:40:05,898
You think
you're ever gonna settle down?

928
00:40:05,965 --> 00:40:08,100
Maybe.

929
00:40:10,637 --> 00:40:12,471
But not with you.

930
00:40:15,542 --> 00:40:17,910
You're in love
with somebody else,

931
00:40:17,977 --> 00:40:20,713
And thanks to my counseling,
she's available now.

932
00:40:31,091 --> 00:40:35,227
And by the way,
she's totally into you, too.

933
00:40:35,295 --> 00:40:37,129
Holly?

934
00:40:39,733 --> 00:40:42,234
Will you come
back and visit?

935
00:40:42,302 --> 00:40:44,370
(sighs)

936
00:40:44,437 --> 00:40:46,972
(voice breaking):
I thought you'd never ask.

937
00:40:50,377 --> 00:40:52,244
(sighs)

938
00:40:57,984 --> 00:41:00,352
(sighs)

939
00:41:04,591 --> 00:41:07,025
Sandy, what are
you doing in here?

940
00:41:07,093 --> 00:41:10,028
I tried to be a hater,
but I just couldn't do it.

941
00:41:10,096 --> 00:41:12,798
That song and the weed
I smoked immediately prior--

942
00:41:12,866 --> 00:41:14,433
It gave me

943
00:41:14,501 --> 00:41:15,868
A change of heart.

944
00:41:15,935 --> 00:41:17,903
Mr. Ryerson offered
to pay for our trip.

945
00:41:17,971 --> 00:41:19,972
(whooping)
bring it!

946
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:21,907
It's drug money, but you know,

947
00:41:21,975 --> 00:41:24,243
It's actually a fantastic way
to launder it.

948
00:41:25,678 --> 00:41:27,880
Good-bye, william.

949
00:41:27,947 --> 00:41:30,215
I miss the arts, I really do.

950
00:41:35,088 --> 00:41:37,556
You just got poked.

951
00:41:37,624 --> 00:41:39,358
Poked by the dagger!

952
00:41:40,593 --> 00:41:43,262
(applause and cheering)

953
00:41:43,329 --> 00:41:45,164
All (chanting):
Detroit! Detroit! Detroit!

954
00:41:45,231 --> 00:41:46,932
Detroit! Detroit! Detroit!

955
00:41:48,134 --> 00:41:50,702
This is a disaster.

956
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:53,405
Pink dagger, not
only did you fail

957
00:41:53,473 --> 00:41:55,207
To disrupt the
night of neglect.

958
00:41:55,275 --> 00:41:56,642
You funded it in full.

959
00:41:56,709 --> 00:41:59,111
In fact,
you were its only donor.

960
00:41:59,179 --> 00:42:00,879
Aretha is my kryptonite.

961
00:42:00,947 --> 00:42:02,114
Sergeant handsome,

962
00:42:02,182 --> 00:42:04,583
What do you have
to say for yourself?

963
00:42:04,651 --> 00:42:07,719
Hey, I did get them to break up.
Who knew it was gonna be

964
00:42:07,787 --> 00:42:10,289
Amicable, and sort of have
nothing to do with me? I pulled

965
00:42:10,356 --> 00:42:13,258
Sunshine out of the benefit.
Don't I get credit for that?

966
00:42:13,326 --> 00:42:17,095
No. In my hour of need,
honey badger, I turn to you.

967
00:42:17,163 --> 00:42:18,597
Your time has come.

968
00:42:21,167 --> 00:42:23,368
(applause)

969
00:42:23,436 --> 00:42:26,472
Well, at the end of regulation,
we're all tied up.

970
00:42:26,539 --> 00:42:28,240
Excuse me, mr. Remington?

971
00:42:28,308 --> 00:42:31,276
We would just like to say hi
to our friends in Glee club.

972
00:42:31,344 --> 00:42:32,511
We love you guys.
Love you.

973
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:33,412
And now...
Love you.

974
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,681
...The tie-breaker question.

975
00:42:35,748 --> 00:42:38,150
The category: "hermaphrodite
nazi sympathizers."
