"Faith" is not exactly
the word.

[Knock at door]

723
00:31:23,622 --> 00:31:25,073
We have to talk.

724
00:31:25,107 --> 00:31:27,075
You cannot be here.
Go home.

725
00:31:27,109 --> 00:31:28,943
No, I-I will.
I promise. I will.

726
00:31:28,978 --> 00:31:31,246
- Just give me two minutes.
- Hey, is that Swifty?

727
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,415
Leo! Hey.
[Laughs] My man!

728
00:31:34,449 --> 00:31:36,668
You have tripled in size!

729
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:38,953
Oh, listen to me.
I've turned into that guy.

730
00:31:38,971 --> 00:31:40,505
What happened
to the goatee?

731
00:31:40,556 --> 00:31:42,957
Oh, it's gone.
But I did get this.

732
00:31:42,975 --> 00:31:45,293
- Am I still cool?
- For an old guy.

733
00:31:45,311 --> 00:31:47,178
Michael is just
dropping something off.

734
00:31:47,229 --> 00:31:48,646
You want to stay
for dinner?

735
00:31:48,681 --> 00:31:50,315
Oh, no, no, no.
There's not enough food.

736
00:31:50,349 --> 00:31:52,350
Well, actually, I'd love to.
I-I skipped lunch.

737
00:31:52,401 --> 00:31:53,685
Well, don't get
too excited.

738
00:31:53,719 --> 00:31:54,986
You know my mom's
idea of cooking

739
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,854
is nuking stuff
from trader Joe's.

740
00:31:56,906 --> 00:31:58,356
That's not true!

741
00:31:58,407 --> 00:32:00,825
I made the salad.

742
00:32:08,984 --> 00:32:11,469
Hey!
[Pounding on door]

743
00:32:11,503 --> 00:32:14,322
I know you're in there.
The doorman told me you were.

744
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,041
[Pounding continues]
He didn't even try to stop me.

745
00:32:17,092 --> 00:32:19,794
He was so nice,

746
00:32:19,828 --> 00:32:23,131
and he treated me
with respect.

747
00:32:23,165 --> 00:32:26,134
Do you even know
what that is...

748
00:32:26,168 --> 00:32:27,735
Respect?

749
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,220
You're drunk, Ivy.

750
00:32:29,271 --> 00:32:31,889
What are you going on about?

751
00:32:31,941 --> 00:32:34,809
Oh, no. No, no, no.
I'm not the problem. You are.

752
00:32:34,843 --> 00:32:36,644
You blow so hot and cold,

753
00:32:36,678 --> 00:32:38,512
I don't even know what day
it is anymore.

754
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,148
You are so hideous to me
in rehearsal...

755
00:32:40,182 --> 00:32:41,532
I'm hardly hideous.

756
00:32:41,567 --> 00:32:43,067
You humiliate me...

757
00:32:43,118 --> 00:32:45,320
When you're not
ignoring me!

758
00:32:45,354 --> 00:32:47,355
Half the time,
I feel like I don't even exist

759
00:32:47,373 --> 00:32:50,425
for you in there!

760
00:32:50,459 --> 00:32:52,460
No one does.

761
00:32:57,216 --> 00:33:00,718
I am not kidding.

762
00:33:00,753 --> 00:33:03,087
And this isn't some big,
romantic statement

763
00:33:03,138 --> 00:33:05,423
about who I am as an artist...
It is just a fact.

764
00:33:05,474 --> 00:33:07,358
Oh, don't give me...

765
00:33:07,393 --> 00:33:10,194
Don't give you what...
The truth?

766
00:33:10,229 --> 00:33:13,181
Isn't that
what you came here for?

767
00:33:13,215 --> 00:33:16,117
Look, I am building something
in that rehearsal room,

768
00:33:16,151 --> 00:33:19,370
and with all due respect,
it would be a lot easier

769
00:33:19,405 --> 00:33:22,040
if everyone pretended
just for five minutes

770
00:33:22,074 --> 00:33:23,775
not to have
all those annoying feelings,

771
00:33:23,826 --> 00:33:25,610
because frankly,
they get in my way.

772
00:33:25,661 --> 00:33:27,195
Theater
is about feelings!

773
00:33:27,229 --> 00:33:30,031
Oh, you can have feelings.

774
00:33:30,065 --> 00:33:33,785
They just need to be
about Marilyn.

775
00:33:33,836 --> 00:33:36,754
I'm not kidding.

776
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:39,240
I know you're not.

777
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,934
Are you staying?

778
00:33:52,638 --> 00:33:55,189
Are you asking me to stay?

779
00:33:57,259 --> 00:33:59,644
Come on...

00:34:04,766 --> 00:34:07,819
Don't be mad at me.

00:34:17,112 --> 00:34:18,496
Come on.

782
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,797
Can I tell you again

783
00:34:19,832 --> 00:34:21,466
how incredible you look
in that dress?

00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,784
Thanks, babe.
This our table?

785
00:34:23,802 --> 00:34:25,453
Uh, sort of.

R.J.'s assistant made sure
I sit by Jill Abramson.

787
00:34:27,622 --> 00:34:29,841

seriously help this guy

land the press secretary job.

789
00:34:31,677 --> 00:34:34,078
She's the executive editor
of the <i>New York Times.</i>

790
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,596
And?

791
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,981
Well, she's got
the mayor's ear.

792
00:34:37,015 --> 00:34:38,966
And?

793
00:34:38,984 --> 00:34:44,772
There are no extra seats
at this table. Sorry.

00:34:44,806 --> 00:34:47,975
Where do I go... the kitchen,
the West Side highway?

No, it's...
It's just there.

uh, helicopter.

Perfect.

Come on, there must be
some little <i>chiquita</i>

who's after you.

800
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,288
Girls in my school
are lame.

801
00:35:00,322 --> 00:35:02,206
Okay, show's over.
We're done.

802
00:35:02,257 --> 00:35:04,792
And what's this brush
with the law I heard about?

803
00:35:04,826 --> 00:35:05,993

[Inhaling sharply]

805
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:10,331
- You told him about that?
- I said, "we're done."

806
00:35:10,349 --> 00:35:13,634
You know, your mother and I
used to smoke a little doob

807

after a tough rehearsal.

808
00:35:14,937 --> 00:35:16,554
- What?
- Michael!

809
00:35:16,605 --> 00:35:18,506

once at camp.

810
00:35:18,524 --> 00:35:19,957
You are such a liar.

811
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:22,226
Okay, Leo,
up to your room, now.

812
00:35:22,277 --> 00:35:24,312
Michael, I am calling you
a car again.

813
00:35:24,346 --> 00:35:26,197
I don't know what happened
to the last one.

00:35:26,231 --> 00:35:27,732
Stop laughing.
[Laughs]

815
00:35:27,783 --> 00:35:31,702
Yes, hi.
It's 428 Carroll, again.

816
00:35:31,737 --> 00:35:33,738
I'm sorry.
I just assumed he knew.

817
00:35:33,772 --> 00:35:37,074
What else does my mom do
after a tough rehearsal?

818
00:35:37,126 --> 00:35:39,076
In bed, now!

819
00:35:39,111 --> 00:35:41,078
[Leo laughs]

820
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,797
[Door closes]

821
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,535
Well, it's... it's not
on Broadway yet.

822
00:35:47,553 --> 00:35:50,204
It's a workshop based
on Marilyn Monroe's life.

823
00:35:50,222 --> 00:35:53,341
Are you Marilyn?

824
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:56,060
Yes, yes.
Yeah, I am.

825
00:35:56,094 --> 00:35:57,562
That's wonderful.

826
00:35:57,596 --> 00:35:59,347
So do they have you
in a little blonde wig

827
00:35:59,381 --> 00:36:01,882
- and a skirt that blows up?
- Okay.

828
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,902
Sorry, but, hey,
you wear a dress like that,

829
00:36:04,937 --> 00:36:07,388
you got to like it
that we look.

830
00:36:07,406 --> 00:36:10,525
Oh, that's right.
That's why I wore this...

831
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:13,361
So that men everywhere
could enjoy looking at me

832
00:36:13,395 --> 00:36:15,279
and think
about having sex with me.

833
00:36:15,314 --> 00:36:16,731
- Oh!
- Was that too direct?

834
00:36:16,765 --> 00:36:19,233
- That's pretty direct.
- [Laughs]

835
00:36:19,251 --> 00:36:21,736
So is the dress, and we
already know you like that.

836
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:25,206
- I'm seeing the Marilyn.
- You want to see some more?

837
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,793
Maybe I should sing you
<i>Happy Birthday, Mr. President.</i>

838
00:36:28,844 --> 00:36:30,578
Would you like that?

839
00:36:30,612 --> 00:36:34,582
How about<i>Happy Birthday,</i>
<i>Mr. Press secretary?</i>

840
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,135
- Press secretary?
- That's right.

841
00:36:38,187 --> 00:36:40,805
You're looking at
the next mayoral press secretary

842
00:36:40,856 --> 00:36:41,922
of New York City.

843
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,458
Really?
Wow.

844
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:47,445
So, uh, do you work
for the city?

845
00:36:47,479 --> 00:36:51,148
Well, not this one
right now... D. C.

846
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,067
How did we get back
to politics?

847
00:36:53,101 --> 00:36:54,952
What do you say...

848
00:36:54,987 --> 00:36:58,239
You sing for me
back at my hotel,

849
00:36:58,273 --> 00:37:00,658
and I buy you room service?

850
00:37:00,709 --> 00:37:04,846
What a fantastic offer...

851
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,114
Mr. Denby.

852
00:37:07,132 --> 00:37:09,617
I'll be in touch.

853
00:37:09,635 --> 00:37:12,303
Excuse me.

854
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:19,436
Who are you?
Sherlock Holmes?

855
00:37:19,498 --> 00:37:20,848
How did you get
all that out of him?

856
00:37:20,883 --> 00:37:22,383
I didn't even have
to try.

857
00:37:22,434 --> 00:37:25,119
- This dress did all the work.
- Well, thank you.

858
00:37:25,154 --> 00:37:28,506
You know,
I'm sorry for everything.

859
00:37:29,942 --> 00:37:32,510
Well, this car
is helping me forgive you.

860
00:37:32,528 --> 00:37:33,844
It sure beats the "C" train.

861
00:37:33,862 --> 00:37:35,863
Oh, you can thank R.J.
for this.

862
00:37:35,898 --> 00:37:38,032
- Do we have to?
- Karen.

863
00:37:38,066 --> 00:37:40,868
I am kidding.
I know there's nothing going on.

864
00:37:40,903 --> 00:37:42,737
She just...
She bugs me.

865
00:37:42,788 --> 00:37:44,205
Oh, there's so nothing
going on.

866
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:47,158
- I know.
- What are you doing?

867
00:37:47,192 --> 00:37:49,410
I'm proving that
there's nothing wrong with me

868
00:37:49,461 --> 00:37:50,661
below the neck.

869
00:37:50,695 --> 00:37:51,996
Well, I never
thought there was.

870
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:54,198
Um, mmm. Mmm.

871
00:37:56,034 --> 00:37:57,835
Um, sorry.

872
00:37:57,869 --> 00:38:00,054
Is there a screen thingamajig
you could put up or something?

873
00:38:00,088 --> 00:38:01,639
- No, sir.
- Okay.

874
00:38:08,447 --> 00:38:12,517
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

875
00:38:12,551 --> 00:38:15,953
Wait.
What is your "wow" about?

876
00:38:15,988 --> 00:38:17,922
Um...

877
00:38:17,956 --> 00:38:21,692
I guess just that we finally got
together and did it.

878
00:38:21,727 --> 00:38:25,112
Yeah.
That's true.

879
00:38:26,949 --> 00:38:31,752
Wait. Why?
What was your "wow" about?

880
00:38:31,787 --> 00:38:37,925
I mean, the sex was great too.
Don't get me wrong.

881
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,628
Tom, I think
it's safe to say

882
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:43,747
that what we just had was in
no way anywhere near "wow" sex.

883
00:38:43,765 --> 00:38:46,968
Oh, my God. Thank God.
I'm so relieved.

884
00:38:47,019 --> 00:38:49,387
Did you really think that
I thought it was great sex?

885
00:38:49,421 --> 00:38:51,138
It was terrible sex.

886
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:54,775
It was maybe even
"wow, that was terrible" sex.

887
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:57,445
Well, I mean,
it wasn't that bad.

888
00:38:57,479 --> 00:38:58,596
I've had worse.

889
00:38:58,614 --> 00:39:00,264
I'm not sure I have.

890
00:39:00,282 --> 00:39:03,367

[Papers rustle]

892
00:39:43,292 --> 00:39:45,126
Okay,
this has got to be us.

893
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,379
It's got to be us.
It's got to... it's got to be us.

894
00:39:48,413 --> 00:39:51,032
Why are you trying so hard
to get rid of me, Jules?

895
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:53,651
You know
you can't get rid of me.

896
00:39:56,204 --> 00:39:59,123
Michael, look at me.

897
00:39:59,157 --> 00:40:01,876
Gladly.

898
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,044

899
00:40:03,095 --> 00:40:05,463

have families now.

900
00:40:05,497 --> 00:40:07,448

more than anything,

901
00:40:07,482 --> 00:40:10,334
and I know
you love yours.

902
00:40:10,352 --> 00:40:13,554
We're not gonna mess that up,
do you hear me?

903
00:40:13,605 --> 00:40:16,557
