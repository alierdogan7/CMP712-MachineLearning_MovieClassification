1
00:00:00,055 --> 00:00:01,303
So here's what you missed
on Glee.

2
00:00:01,325 --> 00:00:03,126
Rachel got the lead in Funny Girl
on Broadway

3
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:04,462
and Kurt now he's starting
a band.

4
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,206
Sue framed Figgins so now
she's a principal

5
00:00:06,219 --> 00:00:07,126
and Becky's a becretary.

6
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:09,341
I'm planning on installing Becky
as my secretary

7
00:00:09,366 --> 00:00:11,956
and I will refer to her as my
becretary.

8
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,952
There's a new bitch on the Cheerio!
and her name's Bree.

9
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,580
And there's a new school nurse,
her name's Penny.

10
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:16,393
Penny Owen.

11
00:00:16,406 --> 00:00:18,226
And she gave Sam a shock of
***

12
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:19,639
and now he's got like the
biggest crush ever.

13
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:22,199
It's your responsibility to dance
with me.

14
00:00:22,218 --> 00:00:24,020
Jake and Marley have found
true love so you know

15
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:24,630
that's gonna last.

16
00:00:24,643 --> 00:00:25,944
It's you and me against the world.

17
00:00:25,963 --> 00:00:27,821
And that's what you missed
on Glee.

18
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,408
(chatter, singing,
playing instruments continues)

19
00:00:37,442 --> 00:00:38,775
All right, big week, guys.

20
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,844
Come on. Gather round.
I have here in my hand...

21
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:41,878
Drumroll, please...

22
00:00:41,913 --> 00:00:45,216
A secret list
of the show choirs

23
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,949
that we will be
in competition with

24
00:00:46,984 --> 00:00:48,718
at Nationals in six weeks.

25
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:50,720
Ooh... Yes. Okay, let's
see what we've got.

26
00:00:50,754 --> 00:00:52,722
We got the Rust-Belters
from Pittsburgh,

27
00:00:52,756 --> 00:00:54,857
the Thunder Showcats
from Gainesville

28
00:00:54,891 --> 00:00:57,059
(clears throat)
and finally, from Fort Wayne,

29
00:00:57,094 --> 00:00:58,361
Throat Explosion.

30
00:00:58,395 --> 00:01:00,963
No!

31
00:01:00,998 --> 00:01:03,265
Why, God?!

32
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:04,099
(groans)

33
00:01:04,134 --> 00:01:05,300
Uh, what? Throat Explosion?

34
00:01:05,335 --> 00:01:06,301
That's a joke, right?

35
00:01:06,336 --> 00:01:07,302
Anything but.

36
00:01:07,337 --> 00:01:08,670
They're the new supergroup

37
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:10,105
the Show Choir Underground's
been buzzing about.

38
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,741
Their budgets for costume,
makeup, hair alone

39
00:01:12,775 --> 00:01:14,776
are astronomical. You guys have
read that Malcolm Gladwell book.

40
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:15,611
<i>Outliers,</i> right?

41
00:01:17,147 --> 00:01:20,114
So, Gladwell says you can't
possibly master anything

42
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:22,617
unless you've spent 10,000
hours practicing it.

43
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:25,620
So students can't even join
Throat Explosion without proving

44
00:01:25,654 --> 00:01:28,689
they've logged in 10,000 hours
of show choir rehearsal.

45
00:01:28,723 --> 00:01:30,191
<i>They don't even go to class.</i>

46
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:32,793
<i>They just perform,</i>
<i>every minute of every day.</i>

47
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:35,228
<i>They live their art.</i>
<i>They know no boundaries.</i>

48
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:37,430
<i>They're constantly pushing the</i>
<i>envelope, living and performing</i>

49
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:39,132
<i>on the edge.</i>
<i>They're like mini Lady Gagas.</i>

50
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:40,634
(cackles)

51
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:42,602
We're so screwed... they're not
like Vocal Adrenaline,

52
00:01:42,637 --> 00:01:43,936
who were unfeeling Borg robots.

53
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:45,405
They're total outsiders
and misfits,

54
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,407
which used to be our niche.
We can't compete

55
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,409
with Throat Explosion anymore
at that level because we lost

56
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,310
our biggest Gaga
when Kurt graduated last year.

57
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,646
Look around, we're a room
full of, like, Katy Perrys now.

58
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,320
Oh, you best check
your spectrum, Queen T,

59
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:57,983
because orange is the new black,
and Unique is the new Gaga.

60
00:01:58,017 --> 00:01:59,618
Well, not Marley...
she's a Katy Perry.

61
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:02,621
So is Sam, so is Blaine. I'm a
Katy Perry and I'm proud of it.

62
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,223
Uh, the truth is, Tina,
we're a potent mix

63
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,224
of Katy Perrys and Lady Gagas
in here.

64
00:02:06,258 --> 00:02:07,525
But it's not a liability...

65
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,960
it's the way we're gonna
beat Throat Explosion.

66
00:02:09,995 --> 00:02:11,762
Some of us in here are,
you know,

67
00:02:11,797 --> 00:02:14,465
- ambi-edge. - Ambi-edge?
You just made that up.

68
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,101
Uh, some of us are more,
you know, wholesome,

69
00:02:17,135 --> 00:02:20,271
innocent, romantic, all-American
girl-and boy-next-door types.

70
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,739
Uh, who in here would describe
themselves as a Gaga?

71
00:02:23,774 --> 00:02:25,242
Okay, great.

72
00:02:25,276 --> 00:02:26,610
And the rest of you are Katys?

73
00:02:26,644 --> 00:02:27,811
Is there a third option?

74
00:02:27,845 --> 00:02:29,680
We're gonna mix it up
a little bit.

75
00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:32,282
We're turning our weaknesses
into our strengths.

76
00:02:33,951 --> 00:02:36,353
This week, the Katys
will get their Gaga on

77
00:02:36,387 --> 00:02:38,121
and the Gagas
will bring the Katy.

78
00:02:38,155 --> 00:02:39,522
Throat Explosion
does their one thing

79
00:02:39,556 --> 00:02:40,989
very, very well,

80
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,292
but we need to be able
to do both, impeccably,

81
00:02:43,327 --> 00:02:44,960
or else we're not gonna have
a chance in hell

82
00:02:44,994 --> 00:02:46,234
of winning Nationals this year.

84
00:02:52,703 --> 00:02:54,669
(door bell jingles)
Here's your check.

85
00:02:54,704 --> 00:02:56,003
Where have you been?

86
00:02:56,038 --> 00:02:57,739
You said you were only gonna
be five minutes late.

87
00:02:57,773 --> 00:02:59,474
I was at Cooper Square.
I was putting an ad

88
00:02:59,508 --> 00:03:01,843
in <i>The Village Voice</i>
for my new band.

89
00:03:01,877 --> 00:03:03,645
Wait, you're starting
a new band?

90
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:05,647
Yes, yes, well,
I-I sort of have to

91
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:07,482
'cause Adam kicked me out
of the Adam's Apples

92
00:03:07,516 --> 00:03:08,850
when he found out
I was engaged.

93
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:10,851
Well, what kind of band
are you starting?

94
00:03:10,885 --> 00:03:12,152
Are you taking girls?

95
00:03:12,186 --> 00:03:15,489
Well, originally, I was thinking
of a Madonna cover band,

96
00:03:15,523 --> 00:03:18,325
but I think I want it to
be more organic than that.

97
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,994
So, yes, girls will be in it,
and I was hoping

98
00:03:21,028 --> 00:03:23,797
the three of you could spare me
the agony of open auditions

99
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:24,998
by signing up.

100
00:03:25,032 --> 00:03:26,499
I don't know, Kurt.

101
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:28,501
I think it's just
a little too soon.

102
00:03:28,535 --> 00:03:31,971
Rachel, Finn wouldn't want you
sitting on the sidelines

103
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:33,406
while life passes you by.

104
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,007
I know. It's just that,

105
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,676
with whatever strength
and creative energy I have,

106
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,010
it has to go towards <i>Funny Girl.</i>

107
00:03:38,044 --> 00:03:39,211
I think that joining a band
right now

108
00:03:39,246 --> 00:03:40,546
would just be a little
too much, but...

109
00:03:40,581 --> 00:03:42,381
thanks.

110
00:03:42,415 --> 00:03:43,482
Well, you've got me.

111
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:44,650
Yes!

112
00:03:44,684 --> 00:03:46,518
What about you, babe?

113
00:03:46,552 --> 00:03:49,187
Okay, I guess. But, listen,
if we're going to be

114
00:03:49,221 --> 00:03:51,456
a part of this band,
we don't just get to help

115
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:54,526
with the set list. We also get
a say on who joins, right?

116
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,263
Sure. As long as you don't go
all crazy Nicki Minaj on me,

117
00:03:58,297 --> 00:03:59,863
I'll see you at auditions.

118
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:03,100
(school bell rings)

119
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:06,837
Well, hi!

120
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,572
Hey.
What's up with your arm?

121
00:04:08,607 --> 00:04:09,873
Is that a... tattoo?

122
00:04:09,908 --> 00:04:11,742
No... no, it's just
a temporary one.

123
00:04:11,777 --> 00:04:14,178
I like to tat up when I go
to Skrillex concerts.

124
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,512
Last time I was there,

125
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,514
he spit in a cup
and threw it on me.

126
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,449
Gross.

127
00:04:19,483 --> 00:04:22,585
Or cool. I guess I wouldn't
have pegged you for the hardcore

128
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,421
dance punk
electronica kind of girl.

129
00:04:24,455 --> 00:04:25,935
I know, right?
The last guy I dated...

130
00:04:25,956 --> 00:04:28,391
I realize now
he's a total dillweed...

131
00:04:28,426 --> 00:04:30,193
but I kind of liked
his taste in music.

132
00:04:30,227 --> 00:04:32,894
I think I have, like,
a musical dark side.

133
00:04:32,929 --> 00:04:34,930
Whoa.
Who is that?

134
00:04:36,065 --> 00:04:38,967
Oh, uh, True Jackson, Lulu
and, uh, Ryan.

135
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:41,637
You haven't seen
<i>True Jackson, VP?</i>

136
00:04:41,671 --> 00:04:42,938
Mm-mm.
Oh, my God.

137
00:04:42,972 --> 00:04:44,573
It's awesome.
I have all three seasons on DVD.

138
00:04:44,607 --> 00:04:46,007
Have you ever thought
about what you would do

139
00:04:46,042 --> 00:04:47,575
if you landed your
dream job as a big shot

140
00:04:47,609 --> 00:04:50,144
of a major company
and you were only 15?

141
00:04:50,178 --> 00:04:52,380
I mean, how would you decorate
your office? Who would you hire?

142
00:04:52,414 --> 00:04:54,382
True Jackson gets the chance
of a lifetime when she's hired

143
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,384
by her idol and made VP of
his fashion empire and then

144
00:04:56,418 --> 00:04:58,152
every week she has to navigate
this scary new world

145
00:04:58,186 --> 00:05:00,221
because True Jackson's gone
from homeroom to the boardroom.

146
00:05:00,255 --> 00:05:01,589
W...

147
00:05:01,623 --> 00:05:02,789
Wow, Sam.

148
00:05:02,824 --> 00:05:04,958
This is not
how I saw you at all.

149
00:05:04,992 --> 00:05:06,593
W... Uh, weren't you a stripper?

150
00:05:06,627 --> 00:05:10,063
Uh, well, uh, we prefer the term
"erotic entertainer."

151
00:05:10,097 --> 00:05:11,598
Ah. I was gonna ask you, uh,

152
00:05:11,632 --> 00:05:13,600
w-would you maybe want
to go out this weekend,

153
00:05:13,634 --> 00:05:15,335
like, um, on a date?

154
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,004
Um, actually,
my ex is taking me

155
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:21,474
to the Nine Inch Nails concert
in Columbus this weekend.

156
00:05:21,508 --> 00:05:23,609
- Not the dillweed.
- Actually, yeah.

157
00:05:23,643 --> 00:05:24,910
I-It's cool though.
We're just friends now,

158
00:05:24,944 --> 00:05:26,912
but he bought the tickets
when we were still dating,

159
00:05:26,946 --> 00:05:28,313
and he really wants me
to go and...

160
00:05:28,348 --> 00:05:30,148
Anyway, look,

161
00:05:30,183 --> 00:05:32,184
I'll call you.

162
00:05:34,987 --> 00:05:36,488
(school bell rings)

163
00:05:36,522 --> 00:05:38,823
<i>True Jackson, VP?</i>
Is that even on anymore?

164
00:05:38,858 --> 00:05:41,025
No, it got canceled. Evidently,
the people at Nickelodeon

165
00:05:41,059 --> 00:05:43,160
don't care about
quality entertainment.

166
00:05:43,195 --> 00:05:45,029
Don't judge me, dude, okay?
I'm bad-ass.

167
00:05:45,063 --> 00:05:47,365
I play football and guitar and
I've been hillbilly handfishing.

168
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,034
I just... I happen to
like sweet things, too.

169
00:05:50,068 --> 00:05:52,369
They relax me. Which is
why I like her so much.

170
00:05:52,404 --> 00:05:54,772
But you said that she's into
Skrillex and Nine Inch Nails.

171
00:05:54,806 --> 00:05:57,140
So she clearly isn't
exactly what she seems.

172
00:05:57,174 --> 00:05:59,276
Exactly! She seems like a Katy
but she's secretly a Gaga,

173
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,944
and she only dates Gagas
and I'm a Katy.

174
00:06:00,978 --> 00:06:02,946
Okay, well, hold up.
Penny likes Gagas

175
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,115
and you're a Katy.
But Mr. Shue's making

176
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:06,516
all the Katys sing a Gaga song,

177
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,051
so we bring Penny in to see it

178
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:11,487
and she's gonna get all weak
in her Skrillex-loving knees

179
00:06:11,522 --> 00:06:13,556
and forget all
about her douche ex-boyfriend.

180
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,957
Then you, my friend,

181
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:16,559
will have a new love
of your life.

182
00:06:16,593 --> 00:06:18,160
Yes.

183
00:06:18,194 --> 00:06:20,362
This Katy/Gaga lesson
is killing me.

184
00:06:20,397 --> 00:06:22,697
It's like Mr. Shue did it
on purpose to keep us apart.

185
00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:24,098
I don't think he
plans that much ahead.

186
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,834
I'm pretty sure he makes up
these rando lessons

187
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:27,969
a split second before he
writes 'em on the board.

188
00:06:28,003 --> 00:06:30,138
Speaking of this week's lesson,

189
00:06:30,172 --> 00:06:33,074
are you still okay
with dating someone so...

190
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:35,009
different than you?

191
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:42,650
(blowing raspberry)

192
00:06:42,684 --> 00:06:45,653
I had Artie first, "bee-yatch"!

193
00:06:45,687 --> 00:06:47,488
You get my sloppy seconds.

194
00:06:47,522 --> 00:06:48,989
Oh, snap!

195
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:52,192
I did not have sex with Becky.

196
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:04,537
So... how long do
we have to wait here?

197
00:07:04,572 --> 00:07:05,905
(sighs) This is humiliating.

198
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,307
I spent all of my tip money
renting out this room

199
00:07:08,342 --> 00:07:09,843
because I thought
we'd have a turnout.

200
00:07:09,877 --> 00:07:11,309
SANTANA: What did you expect?
No one's gonna try out

201
00:07:11,344 --> 00:07:12,611
for a band that doesn't
even have a name.

202
00:07:12,645 --> 00:07:15,080
Although I came up
with an amazing one.

203
00:07:15,114 --> 00:07:19,217
Okay, we are not naming the
band the Apocalipsticks, okay?

204
00:07:19,251 --> 00:07:21,887
I'm manifesting the
perfect name, all right?

205
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:25,090
It takes time. Yeah, and in the
meantime, no one signs up.

206
00:07:25,124 --> 00:07:28,092
Well, one person did.
They obviously chickened out.

207
00:07:28,126 --> 00:07:29,560
Maybe it's for the best.

208
00:07:29,595 --> 00:07:31,462
I mean, who names
himself Starchild?

209
00:07:31,429 --> 00:07:34,063
***

210
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,158
***

211
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:36,845
Sorry I'm late.

212
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,983
People kept stopping me
on the street,

213
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:40,172
Asking if they could take
their picture with me.

214
00:07:40,105 --> 00:07:42,739
Yeah, 'cause you look
friggin' bad-ass.

215
00:07:42,773 --> 00:07:44,273
Thanks.

216
00:07:44,308 --> 00:07:46,510
I design and sew
this costume myself.

217
00:07:46,544 --> 00:07:48,478
It's a little Project Runway,

218
00:07:48,513 --> 00:07:50,346
Season 6.

219
00:07:50,381 --> 00:07:52,021
- Have you prepared a song?
- Yeah, of course.

220
00:07:52,049 --> 00:07:53,517
It's by one
of my favorite artists,

221
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:55,852
somebody that always inspires me
to be myself,

222
00:07:55,887 --> 00:07:58,254

Bravo!

296
00:10:58,323 --> 00:10:59,356
I would not

297
00:10:59,391 --> 00:11:00,992
be embarrassed
to share the stage with you.

298
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:03,260
You just rocked it so hard.

299
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,261
Thanks. Thank you for
your time, Starchild,

300
00:11:05,296 --> 00:11:07,097
but it's not a fit.

301
00:11:07,131 --> 00:11:08,732
Are you insane?
I'm sorry. Would you mind

302
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:10,100
just stepping outside
for a moment while I bitch-slap

303
00:11:10,134 --> 00:11:11,334
some sense into my friend?

304
00:11:11,368 --> 00:11:12,502
No, I don't need
a minute, okay?

305
00:11:12,536 --> 00:11:13,603
I've made my decision,
all right?

306
00:11:13,637 --> 00:11:15,972
Your aesthetic is
striking, Starchild,

307
00:11:16,007 --> 00:11:20,210
but it's a little outré for
the team that I'm assembling.

308
00:11:20,244 --> 00:11:21,376
But if you're willing

309
00:11:21,411 --> 00:11:22,511
to tone down your look,

310
00:11:22,545 --> 00:11:23,545
maybe I'd reconsider.

311
00:11:35,158 --> 00:11:37,425
You wanted to see me,
Principal Sylvester?

312
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:38,926
SUE: Would you care
to explain

313
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,461
why you're dressed
like Lady Gaga?

314
00:11:40,496 --> 00:11:43,330
Would you care to explain why
<i>you're</i> dressed like Lady Gaga?

315
00:11:43,364 --> 00:11:44,931
I don't know
what you're talking about.

316
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:46,933
If you're referring
to my face cage,

317
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:48,935
I'll have you know that
tomorrow I'm scheduled

318
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:50,437
for a routine colonoscopy,

319
00:11:50,471 --> 00:11:53,674
and this apparatus helps
me avoid solid foods.

320
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,443
Okay. Well, the Glee Club

321
00:11:56,477 --> 00:11:58,712
you specifically asked me
to try to mess with

322
00:11:58,746 --> 00:12:01,380
is doing some
Katy Perry-Lady Gaga week

323
00:12:01,415 --> 00:12:04,717
in an attempt to get 100%
of America to not like them.

324
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:06,051
Anyway,
Jake Puckerman's a Gaga,

325
00:12:06,086 --> 00:12:08,621
and he's all up in that girl
Marley with the fat mom,

326
00:12:08,655 --> 00:12:10,423
who's a Katy, probably because

327
00:12:10,457 --> 00:12:13,359
her mom's boobs also
shoot out whipped cream.

328
00:12:13,393 --> 00:12:14,793
So, I thought I'd throw
a little Gaga his way,

329
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:16,027
and see what happens.

330
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:17,262
This practice of referring

331
00:12:17,296 --> 00:12:19,864
to oneself
as a Katy or a Gaga...

332
00:12:19,898 --> 00:12:23,034
the Glee Club will be
doing this the entire week?

333
00:12:23,068 --> 00:12:24,102
Super annoying, right?

334
00:12:24,136 --> 00:12:26,137
It is the most annoying thing

335
00:12:26,171 --> 00:12:28,039
they've ever done.

336
00:12:28,073 --> 00:12:29,040
Ugh!

337
00:12:29,074 --> 00:12:30,475
Well, it appears Will Schuester

338
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:32,476
has taken up
the age-old question

339
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,946
that has vexed
creepy pederasts since Socrates.

340
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,781
Before Katy versus Gaga,

341
00:12:37,815 --> 00:12:40,451
it was Jackie versus Marilyn,
Betty versus Veronica,

342
00:12:40,485 --> 00:12:43,287
Mary Todd Lincoln versus
Martha Washington.

343
00:12:43,321 --> 00:12:46,957
Why must we always choose
<i>between</i> female pop archetypes?

344
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:48,958
Why can't we just be them all?

345
00:12:48,992 --> 00:12:51,160
I sort of don't know what
you're talking about anymore.

346
00:12:51,194 --> 00:12:54,330
That's because, for the past
12 hours, I have ingested

347
00:12:54,365 --> 00:12:56,566
eight gallons
of saline solution.

348
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,435
I have more salt water in
my colon than Richard Simmons

349
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,337
after a poorly-executed
cannonball

350
00:13:01,372 --> 00:13:03,438
off the Fire Island Ferry.

351
00:13:03,473 --> 00:13:05,741
Now get the hell
out of my office.

352
00:13:07,977 --> 00:13:09,844
(school bell ringing)

353
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:13,014
Okay, we have to get to
Breadstix extra early on Friday

354
00:13:13,048 --> 00:13:15,350
because they are having
a Julie Andrews tribute

355
00:13:15,385 --> 00:13:16,518
at the Lima Limelight.

356
00:13:16,552 --> 00:13:18,787
<i>Mary Poppins, Sound of Music,</i>

357
00:13:18,821 --> 00:13:20,521
Princess Diaries, back to back.

358
00:13:20,555 --> 00:13:22,456
It's gonna be amazing.

359
00:13:22,491 --> 00:13:23,891
Yeah, that sounds
really awesome.

360
00:13:23,925 --> 00:13:27,194
Do you <i>not</i> think
it sounds amazing?

361
00:13:27,228 --> 00:13:28,562
I mean, it's just,
like, the same thing.

362
00:13:28,597 --> 00:13:31,299
Breadstix, movie, Breadstix,
movie, Breadstix, three movies,

363
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,533
weekend after weekend.

364
00:13:32,567 --> 00:13:33,734
(sighs)

365
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:35,368
I love you.

366
00:13:35,403 --> 00:13:37,437
I'm bored of doing
the same thing.

367
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:40,540
Let's just, uh...

368
00:13:40,574 --> 00:13:41,874
shake it up a little bit, eh?

369
00:13:41,909 --> 00:13:44,411
Okay. Okay.
Uh, forget <i>Mary Poppins.</i>

370
00:13:44,445 --> 00:13:45,878
We can do something else.
Okay.

371
00:13:45,913 --> 00:13:48,748
Um, uh, they're having
Orchid Mania at the gardens.

372
00:13:50,451 --> 00:13:51,717
Uh, at the mall,

373
00:13:51,751 --> 00:13:53,452
there's a mobile
cat adoption we could go to.

374
00:13:53,486 --> 00:13:55,954
You are such a Katy.

375
00:13:55,988 --> 00:13:57,656
I don't know how you're gonna
pull off being a Gaga.

376
00:13:57,691 --> 00:14:00,693
Why? Because I like cats
and flowers and Julie Andrews?

377
00:14:01,894 --> 00:14:04,196
That doesn't mean
I can't rock a bra

378
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,831
made out
of gloved leather hands.

379
00:14:05,865 --> 00:14:09,500
Ooh, and I cannot wait
to see that.

380
00:14:09,535 --> 00:14:11,836
Come on.

381
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,505
All right, Gagas, I'm taking
over this Monster Ball,

382
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,673
since I'm obviously

383
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,241
the edgiest one in the group.

384
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:19,076
And as a former teen stripper,
I understand the...

385
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:21,245
power of theatricality
and performativity.

386
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,280
Yeah, but what-what
are they building?

387
00:14:23,315 --> 00:14:25,248
The future, Ryder.
They're building the future.

388
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:26,249
All right, we're
gonna get scary

389
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,051
and weird and controversial.

390
00:14:28,085 --> 00:14:30,053
Uh, hence the catwalk?

391
00:14:30,087 --> 00:14:31,388
We're taking it into
the audience, Blaine, right

392
00:14:31,422 --> 00:14:33,390
in their faces and we're gonna
drop-kick the fourth wall.

393
00:14:33,424 --> 00:14:34,924
Are those strobe lights?
Believe it!

394
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,727
Because some kids
might be epileptic.

395
00:14:36,761 --> 00:14:39,395
Is it a seizure or is it just hardcore
next-level break-dancing? I don't know.

396
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:42,465
Come on, guys, I need sick ideas...
if we're gonna impress Penny,

397
00:14:42,499 --> 00:14:43,899
this thing has to be so crazy

398
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:46,301
that it's declared legally
and clinically insane.

399
00:14:46,336 --> 00:14:50,740
What if we had, like,
sparklers but we're inside?

400
00:14:50,774 --> 00:14:53,075
That's crazy. RYDER: Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

401
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:55,410
Or-or, uh, confetti,
only shaped like human skulls.

402
00:14:55,444 --> 00:14:57,879
No! No, no, no, no!
No, those ideas suck!

403
00:14:57,913 --> 00:14:59,481
You're not thinking
edgy and fresh!

404
00:14:59,515 --> 00:15:01,315
You're thinking safe
and tired and boring!

405
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,917
Okay, look, here.

406
00:15:02,951 --> 00:15:04,386
Take the sheet music
for "Applause," okay?

407
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,387
Learn it.

408
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:06,388
Own it.

409
00:15:06,422 --> 00:15:08,222
Live it.

410
00:15:08,257 --> 00:15:09,724
And then
strap in because right...

411
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:10,892
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, Artie.

412
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:12,426
We're not doing
this for Glee Club.

413
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,561
We're doing this in front
of the entire school.

414
00:15:14,596 --> 00:15:16,096
And, yes,

415
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,931
Penny the school nurse will be
in attendance.

416
00:15:17,965 --> 00:15:20,100
(gasps) Now, if
you'll excuse me,

417
00:15:20,134 --> 00:15:21,902
I'm gonna go guarantee
a sold-out show.

418
00:15:21,936 --> 00:15:23,103
How are you gonna do that?

419
00:15:23,137 --> 00:15:24,237
The same way Gaga would:

420
00:15:24,272 --> 00:15:26,306
by recruiting
some Little Monsters.

421
00:15:27,441 --> 00:15:29,275
(school bell rings)
SAM: Hey, Becky.

422
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:31,511
Wait up. I need
your help with something.

423
00:15:31,545 --> 00:15:32,912
Bug off.

424
00:15:32,946 --> 00:15:35,247
I don't do handies.

425
00:15:35,282 --> 00:15:37,016
What? Uh, no. That's
not what I meant.

426
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,518
Just stop for a
second, okay? Look.

427
00:15:38,552 --> 00:15:40,119
I know what your deal is:

428
00:15:40,153 --> 00:15:42,455
on the outside,
you pretend to be Katy, but...

429
00:15:42,489 --> 00:15:45,123
inside your soul is pure Gaga.

430
00:15:45,157 --> 00:15:46,725
What are you talking about?

431
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:48,359
Lady Gaga.

432
00:15:48,394 --> 00:15:49,127
Who?

433
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:50,462
Katy Perry?

434
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:51,863
The governor of Texas?

435
00:15:51,898 --> 00:15:54,065
Okay, l... Never mind.

436
00:15:54,099 --> 00:15:55,300
Listen. Just trust me.

437
00:15:55,334 --> 00:15:57,335
We're putting on a huge show
in Glee Club, and I need you

438
00:15:57,369 --> 00:15:59,237
to get the word out to all
the McKinley Monsters, okay?

439
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:00,337
All right, fine.

440
00:16:00,371 --> 00:16:04,007
Whatever. I'll do it
if you just shut up!

441
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:05,843
(groans)

442
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:08,579
That was rude.

443
00:16:08,613 --> 00:16:11,482
So, Santana showed me
Starchild's

444
00:16:11,516 --> 00:16:12,850
amazing audition video,

445
00:16:12,884 --> 00:16:15,085
Ah. And she said that
you passed on him

446
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:16,519
because you didn't want to share

447
00:16:16,554 --> 00:16:18,855
the "lavender limelight"
with anyone.

448
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:20,490
Rachel, it's a band, all right?

449
00:16:20,524 --> 00:16:22,024
If I was afraid of sharing
the limelight with someone,

450
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:23,492
I would do a solo show
at the Duplex

451
00:16:23,526 --> 00:16:25,393
about my obsession
with Broadway divas.

452
00:16:25,428 --> 00:16:27,830
Why did you do that? You know,
he's really something special.

453
00:16:27,864 --> 00:16:30,365
(sighs) Like I said
before, Starchild's look,

454
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,335
it's just too... edgy,
I-it's too out there.

455
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:35,036
It's-it's not what I want
for this band.

456
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,672
Okay, and what is that, exactly?
I don't know.

457
00:16:36,706 --> 00:16:39,074
Mainstream acceptance
and success, for once.

458
00:16:39,108 --> 00:16:41,843
Look, I've been doing this
"weirdo, quirky, fabulous,

459
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:44,411
"outrageous, sidekick, best
friend" thing for a while now,

460
00:16:44,446 --> 00:16:45,847
and it hasn't
gotten me very far.

461
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:47,882
It got you to New York,
it got you into NYADA.

462
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,584
Does that give me
financial security?

463
00:16:49,618 --> 00:16:51,018
A mass audience?

464
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,419
A song on the radio?

465
00:16:52,454 --> 00:16:53,521
Since when
is that what you want?

466
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:54,856
Maybe since I moved to New York

467
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,691
and saw one of my friends
book a Broadway show

468
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,324
and another one,
a national commercial.

469
00:16:58,359 --> 00:16:59,793
Look, Rachel,

470
00:16:59,827 --> 00:17:01,461
there's nothing wrong
with wanting to be

471
00:17:01,496 --> 00:17:02,829
that thing that everyone likes,

472
00:17:02,864 --> 00:17:05,231
that thing that everyone
wants to see and hear

473
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:07,534
and that doesn't offend
or challenge anyone.

474
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,370
No, that's not you.
You're way more specific.

475
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,871
Which is code for fringe,

476
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,873
which is code for unsuccessful,

477
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,541
which is code for,
"You'll never make it

478
00:17:15,575 --> 00:17:17,242
in the big leagues, kid.
Stop trying."

479
00:17:17,276 --> 00:17:19,845
I know it's not my band, so I'm
not gonna tell you what to do.

480
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,413
But as your best friend
and your biggest fan,

481
00:17:21,447 --> 00:17:23,348
what I love the most about you

482
00:17:23,383 --> 00:17:24,917
is that you don't try
to do or be

483
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:28,052
what anyone else is doing, okay?
You make your own path.

484
00:17:28,086 --> 00:17:29,721
(sighs)

485
00:17:29,755 --> 00:17:31,523
It's so hard sometimes.
I know.

486
00:17:31,557 --> 00:17:34,091
But it's gonna be worth it
in the long run, I promise you.

487
00:17:34,126 --> 00:17:36,227
Your brand, it's gonna be huge.

488
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:38,029
Look at Madonna. She was
performing in the East Village,

489
00:17:38,063 --> 00:17:40,264
and then she was
on the Super Bowl, okay?

490
00:17:40,298 --> 00:17:42,199
That's gonna be you...
I know it.

491
00:17:42,234 --> 00:17:44,735
You are a true talent, Kurt,

492
00:17:44,769 --> 00:17:48,005
but I think, you know,
that Starchild might be as well.

493
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:49,406
And, luckily,
it might not be too late

494
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,473
for you to call him back.

495
00:17:52,443 --> 00:17:53,777
I wish. I...

496
00:17:53,811 --> 00:17:55,412
don't even have
his phone number.

497
00:17:55,446 --> 00:17:57,347
Or his real name.

498
00:17:57,381 --> 00:17:59,349
I'm so excited
for this weekend.

499
00:17:59,383 --> 00:18:02,885
Me, too. I was thinking we
could add a little edge to it.

500
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,687
Okay. Oh, I know!
Mm-hmm?

501
00:18:04,721 --> 00:18:06,355
I can get us
some John Mayer tickets.

502
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:08,457
He's supposed
to be amazing live.

503
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:11,861
Uh, well, I'm-I'm
sure he is, but...

504
00:18:11,895 --> 00:18:13,696
Yeah, it'll be fun.
Can't wait.

505
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:14,864
Mwah.

506
00:18:14,898 --> 00:18:17,799
Well, well,
look at these two cuties.

507
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,035
Jake, I just wanted to mention

508
00:18:20,069 --> 00:18:22,370
that the Cheerios! Are working
on something big

509
00:18:22,404 --> 00:18:25,040
and could really use your
silky smooth dance moves

510
00:18:25,074 --> 00:18:28,409
that make an awkward attempt
at combining hip-hop and ballet.

511
00:18:28,444 --> 00:18:29,811
You're the best dancer
in this hellhole,

512
00:18:29,845 --> 00:18:31,645
and I need you to help me
choreograph a number.

513
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,082
Thanks, Bree, but I'm not really
a choreographer.

514
00:18:35,116 --> 00:18:36,516
Babe, no, you should do it.

515
00:18:36,551 --> 00:18:38,418
You love it
and you're so good at that.

516
00:18:38,453 --> 00:18:40,087
Really?
Mm-hmm.

517
00:18:40,121 --> 00:18:42,255
Okay, sure. Why not? I'm in.

518
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,523
Bad-ass.

519
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:45,525
I'll text you rehearsal dates.

520
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,561
'Kay. Thanks. Bye.

521
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,831
(chuckles)

522
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:54,433
And a fun fact:
the name "Ohio" originates

523
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:55,868
from the Iroquois word

524
00:18:55,903 --> 00:18:58,304
<i>"ohi-yo',"</i>
<i>meaning "good river."</i>

525
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:00,473
SUE:
Attention, McKinley idiots.

526
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:01,874
Here are
your morning announcements

527
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:03,875
that I didn't do earlier
because I was busy

528
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,812
publicly breast-feeding my baby
at Starbucks.

529
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:09,047
Once again,
it's flea and tick season.

530
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:12,784
Please be sure to thoroughly
inspect your overly hormonal,

531
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,019
acne-riddled bodies.

532
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:17,155
(discordant notes playing)

533
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:21,792
BECKY: I am one of Mother
Monster's devoted disciples,

534
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:25,029
and I command you to open
your laptops immediately.

535
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,531
(discordant notes playing
over P.A. system)

536
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:33,370
(loud booing on video)

537
00:19:33,404 --> 00:19:36,039
(techno beat starts)

538
00:19:46,216 --> 00:19:48,551
I don't understand this video!

539
00:19:56,425 --> 00:19:58,426
(music winds down, stops)

540
00:20:00,229 --> 00:20:01,697
Th... I mean, it's just
a little teaser video

541
00:20:01,731 --> 00:20:03,065
you know,
to get everybody psyched

542
00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:04,199
for our Gaga performance.

543
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:05,600
It's at 3:30.

544
00:20:05,635 --> 00:20:07,569
Uh, I saw.
(chuckles)

545
00:20:07,603 --> 00:20:09,403
So, are you gonna come?

546
00:20:09,437 --> 00:20:10,571
I can't.

547
00:20:10,605 --> 00:20:12,206
I'm getting a new piercing.

548
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,207
What? Where?

549
00:20:13,241 --> 00:20:14,375
Oh! On my ear.

550
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:16,778
Oh, well, th... cool.
That's... yeah.

551
00:20:16,812 --> 00:20:19,446
That's weird, you know,
'cause I was actually planning

552
00:20:19,481 --> 00:20:21,549
on getting multiple
ear piercings this weekend.

553
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,750
We should do it together. That way, you
know, you could catch our show today.

554
00:20:23,785 --> 00:20:26,053
You know, 'cause it's gonna be
really crazy, like Gaga crazy.

555
00:20:26,087 --> 00:20:29,122
Especially me, you know, 'cause
I'm all totally edgy and stuff.

556
00:20:29,157 --> 00:20:30,557
- Mmm.
- So?

557
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,458
What do you say? Yes? No? Yes?

558
00:20:32,493 --> 00:20:34,427
- Yes? Yes?
- Sure.

559
00:20:37,244 --> 00:20:39,797
Okay. I'm thinking of lions
and tigers.

560
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:42,490
We'll unleash them from the zoo.
Now, that's "Roar."

561
00:20:42,525 --> 00:20:45,059
I want to whip the audience and
make them our slaves.

562
00:20:45,093 --> 00:20:47,495
Let's reenact a
baby's birth onstage!

563
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,431
Ooh, we can float in giant
plastic bags of amniotic fluid.

564
00:20:50,465 --> 00:20:51,833
Puckerman!

565
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:52,767
Are you awake?

566
00:20:52,769 --> 00:20:54,769
We've been at this
for five hours.

567
00:20:54,803 --> 00:20:56,269
And we'll be at it
five more hours

568
00:20:56,303 --> 00:20:57,604
until we come up
with the perfect idea.

569
00:20:57,606 --> 00:20:58,939
Okay. Later.

570
00:20:58,973 --> 00:21:00,541
Where do you think you're
going?

571
00:21:00,575 --> 00:21:01,608
To the dance studio.

572
00:21:01,643 --> 00:21:02,776
I'm helping the Cheerios

573
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,144
with some choreography.

574
00:21:04,178 --> 00:21:05,546
Who talked you into doing that?

575
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,613
Let me guess.

576
00:21:06,648 --> 00:21:07,614
(mockingly):
Bree.

577
00:21:07,649 --> 00:21:10,050
She is the most vile

578
00:21:10,084 --> 00:21:11,717
human being on this planet.

579
00:21:11,752 --> 00:21:14,319
And, yes, I know that is saying
something, coming from me.

580
00:21:22,696 --> 00:21:25,330
(school bell rings) Marley.

581
00:21:25,365 --> 00:21:27,166
I'm not saying that Jake's
on the verge of cheating,

582
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,433
but I'm not not saying it.

583
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:30,334
Like my Aunt Felicia
always says,

584
00:21:30,369 --> 00:21:31,770
a tiger can't change
his stripes.

585
00:21:31,804 --> 00:21:33,104
Especially when that
tiger's a man slut.

586
00:21:33,138 --> 00:21:35,173
Jake's not like that. Not anymore.
(sighs)

587
00:21:35,207 --> 00:21:38,242
I know he loves you and you <i>love</i>
<i>him, but that was pre-Bree.</i>

588
00:21:38,277 --> 00:21:40,745
That girl is poison.
She is whack like crack,

589
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,080
a penis flytrap, Marley.

590
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:44,648
She will chew him up.

Great. What am I supposed
to do? I'm not like that.

595
00:21:51,957 --> 00:21:54,357
I'm not that kind of girl. This
is your week to fight back.

596
00:21:54,392 --> 00:21:55,859
You need to go full Gaga
and show them both

597
00:21:55,894 --> 00:21:57,054
that you can be hardcore, too.

598
00:21:57,062 --> 00:21:58,596
I'm not gonna get paranoid
about Jake.

599
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:01,631

you think I'm just

656
00:24:34,608 --> 00:24:35,708
comfortable up here
with no shirt on!

657
00:24:35,743 --> 00:24:37,043
Yeah, you probably are.

658
00:24:37,077 --> 00:24:38,811
Well, I'm not exactly loving
this giant white thing

659
00:24:38,846 --> 00:24:40,312
that keeps getting caught
in my wheels.

660
00:24:40,347 --> 00:24:41,948
Yeah, and I look like
Siegfried <i>and</i> Roy,

661
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:43,049
and I still did it.

662
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:44,217
It <i>was</i> the assignment.

663
00:24:44,251 --> 00:24:45,384
Okay, I'm sorry, you guys,

664
00:24:45,418 --> 00:24:46,619
but I am who I am,

665
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:48,620
and I'm not gonna
change that for any number

00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,789
- or any guy. - WILL: Marley,
we're all trying

667
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,624
to win a championship here,
as a team,

668
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,692
but you put your personal
agenda above that.

669
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:55,894
I'm sorry, but...

670
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:57,896
you're suspended
for the rest of the week.

671
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:03,534
Oh, snap!

672
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,185
Are you freaking kidding me?

673
00:25:12,197 --> 00:25:13,430
You just see what they did.

674
00:25:13,449 --> 00:25:14,969
I have literally
giving you...

675
00:25:16,327 --> 00:25:17,117
This is not going to work.

676
00:25:17,128 --> 00:25:19,897
- Stop it.
- Guys, we need to focus!

677
00:25:19,932 --> 00:25:21,933
It is now the day of,
and we still don't have

678
00:25:21,967 --> 00:25:23,601
a strong plan for this
Katy song, and I think

679
00:25:23,635 --> 00:25:25,335
- it's pretty obvious what the problem is.
- Uh, because

680
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:27,437
we're a bunch of Gagas
trying to out-Katy the Katys

681
00:25:27,471 --> 00:25:28,939
who just did a Gaga song
featuring Marley

682
00:25:28,973 --> 00:25:30,106
as Katy?

683
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,608
Besides, we did have a plan,

684
00:25:31,642 --> 00:25:33,509
but King Latifah
dropped the ball.

685
00:25:33,544 --> 00:25:35,344
Uh-uh. Let me
auto-correct that for you.

686
00:25:35,379 --> 00:25:37,513
I tried breaking into the zoo
to get us live tigers.

687
00:25:37,548 --> 00:25:39,115
Plot twist:
Lima doesn't have a zoo!

688
00:25:39,149 --> 00:25:40,349
Why'd we think it did?

689
00:25:40,384 --> 00:25:41,985
But I did get us a lion costume

690
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:43,151
to make up for it.
Didn't I?

691
00:25:49,025 --> 00:25:50,158
(heavy sigh)

692
00:25:50,193 --> 00:25:52,061
I'm really not okay with this.

693
00:25:52,095 --> 00:25:53,562
Guys, the real problem is,
we're thinking

694
00:25:53,597 --> 00:25:55,263
gimmicks and
spectacle, and, yes,

695
00:25:55,298 --> 00:25:57,232
both Katy and Gaga
share that, but...

696
00:25:57,266 --> 00:26:00,635
what people love about Katy's
music is it's fun and kind

697
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:02,570
and real and girl-next-door.

698
00:26:02,605 --> 00:26:03,972
We need to strip it down.

699
00:26:04,006 --> 00:26:06,040
No costumes,
no special effects,

700
00:26:06,075 --> 00:26:08,910
no gimmicks...
just the music.

701
00:26:11,013 --> 00:26:12,113
Seriously,

702
00:26:12,147 --> 00:26:14,015
I look like a gay Thundercat.

703
00:26:20,354 --> 00:26:22,122
Hello.
Welcome to the Spotlight.

704
00:26:22,156 --> 00:26:25,125
I'm Kurt, I'll be
your Chorus Boy waiter today.

705
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:28,962
Could I start you off with one
of our signature Orange Freezes?

706
00:26:28,997 --> 00:26:31,163
First, uh, can I
ask you something?

707
00:26:31,197 --> 00:26:33,298
Is this toned down enough?

708
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:34,967
Oh, my God... Starchild.

709
00:26:35,002 --> 00:26:36,902
(chuckles)
It's Elliot Gilbert, actually.

710
00:26:36,937 --> 00:26:38,403
(laughs quietly)

711
00:26:38,438 --> 00:26:40,973
Do you have a minute to talk?
Yeah, I-I'm taking

712
00:26:41,008 --> 00:26:42,141
an intermission.

713
00:26:42,175 --> 00:26:44,010
Okay, uh, that's how we say.

714
00:26:44,044 --> 00:26:45,444
"I'm taking a break" here.

715
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,598
We have to say it that way,
otherwise we get fined. Mm.

716
00:26:47,613 --> 00:26:49,014
Uh, I'm so happy to see you.

717
00:26:49,048 --> 00:26:50,682
I've been trying to find you
since your audition.

718
00:26:50,716 --> 00:26:52,951
Yeah, same.
Uh, hence my stalking you.

719
00:26:52,985 --> 00:26:55,286
(chuckles) So, I'm just gonna
come right out and say this.

720
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,956
Uh... I need to be
in your band.

721
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,025
I mean, I came to New York
to be in your band.

722
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:02,293
Something cool and
fun and-and special.

723
00:27:02,327 --> 00:27:04,695
Well, here's hopin'.
Um, came from where?

724
00:27:04,729 --> 00:27:06,864
Uh, if you say Ohio,
I'm gonna die.

725
00:27:06,898 --> 00:27:08,398
Paramus, New Jersey.

726
00:27:08,432 --> 00:27:09,700
Land of malls.

727
00:27:09,734 --> 00:27:11,035
Oh. As soon as I was old enough,

728
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:13,203
I used to take New Jersey
Transit into the city

729
00:27:13,237 --> 00:27:16,473
to see shows and concerts
and go to museums.

730
00:27:16,507 --> 00:27:18,208
So I only applied to
colleges in New York.

731
00:27:18,242 --> 00:27:20,877
- Oh, do you go to NYADA, too?
- No. NYU.

732
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:23,079
Oh. I... didn't get in to NYADA.

733
00:27:23,113 --> 00:27:26,049
- Yeah? - But it's cool. I mean, I'm
doing things all over the city,

734
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:28,751
and one of the things on
my artist's bucket list

735
00:27:28,786 --> 00:27:30,386
is to be in an indie band.

736
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,454
So, if...

737
00:27:32,489 --> 00:27:34,790
Starchild's too much for you...

738
00:27:34,824 --> 00:27:36,558
I can be whoever you want.

739
00:27:36,592 --> 00:27:38,927
(chuckles) I just wanted
to make an impression.

740
00:27:38,961 --> 00:27:40,062
You did.

741
00:27:40,096 --> 00:27:41,897
And after a lot
of soul-searching,

742
00:27:41,931 --> 00:27:44,066
I've come to the conclusion
that the greatest chance

743
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,968
for my band and my-my brand
to be successful

744
00:27:47,003 --> 00:27:49,071
is to surround myself
with the best people.

745
00:27:49,105 --> 00:27:50,605
And although there
wasn't much of it,

746
00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:53,174
you blew the competition away.

747
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:54,875
(laughs) So I can
audition again?

748
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,711
No.

749
00:27:56,745 --> 00:27:58,345
You're in.
As Elliot Gilbert,

750
00:27:58,379 --> 00:28:00,848
as Starchild,
or someone in between.

751
00:28:00,882 --> 00:28:02,850
Whoever you want to be.
SANTANA: Intermission's over.

752
00:28:02,884 --> 00:28:05,019
And you have a fiancé,
so stop flirting.

753
00:28:05,053 --> 00:28:07,553
Santana, this is Elliot Gilbert,

754
00:28:07,588 --> 00:28:09,622
AKA Starchild.

755
00:28:09,656 --> 00:28:10,957
Oh, well, hot damn!

756
00:28:10,991 --> 00:28:12,058
(chuckles)

757
00:28:12,093 --> 00:28:14,594
And I hope the newest
member of our band.

758
00:28:16,997 --> 00:28:19,099
(school bell ringing)

759
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:22,968
Hey, uh, you disappeared
after our show.

760
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:23,969
What'd you think?

761
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:25,971
Mmm... well,
I really liked the part

762
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:27,405
where the girl got suspended.

763
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,575
No, I... about our... what'd
you think about our number?

764
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,911
I didn't hate it.

765
00:28:32,946 --> 00:28:35,447
Okay, I kind of did. But it's
nothing against you, though.

766
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:37,616
Lady Gaga just isn't my thing.

767
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:38,983
She's just too dark for me.

768
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,985
I thought you said you
had a musical dark side.

769
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:43,955
I lied. My exes have
musical dark sides.

770
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:45,790
Ever since preschool,
people have said,

771
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:48,492
sure, Penny Owen has beautiful,
wavy, sun-kissed hair,

772
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:50,327
but she's just so vanilla.

773
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:53,064
So I started dating bad boys,
and bad boys can be fun

774
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:55,899
until they steal your heart,
and your car,

775
00:28:55,933 --> 00:28:57,173
and everything
out of your dorm.

776
00:28:57,201 --> 00:28:58,735
I'm done with bad boys.

777
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,070
And my favorite artists

778
00:29:00,104 --> 00:29:01,905
are mainstream
singer-songwriters,

779
00:29:01,939 --> 00:29:04,841
like Carrie Underwood,
Bruno Mars and Katy Perry.

780
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:06,676
Me, too! Oh, my gosh,
I am so not a Gaga.

781
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,779
Oh! I love Katy Perry.
I'm such a Katy.

782
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:10,846
Oh, it just feels so good
to say it out loud.

783
00:29:10,881 --> 00:29:12,948
I... I also still like
the Jonas Brothers.

784
00:29:12,983 --> 00:29:14,917
- I still like the Biebs.
- No.

785
00:29:14,951 --> 00:29:18,020
You know, Katy Perry's
going on tour next year.

786
00:29:18,054 --> 00:29:21,257
You want to hit up a concert with
me, if she ever comes to Ohio?

787
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:23,425
Uh, y... sure,
yeah, sure, yeah.

788
00:29:23,459 --> 00:29:25,194
Uh, but why wait a year?

789
00:29:25,228 --> 00:29:27,628
Some of the Glee Club are
doing a Katy jam today.

790
00:29:27,663 --> 00:29:29,297
Oh, yeah, that could be...

791
00:29:35,271 --> 00:29:37,005

00:32:47,487 --> 00:32:49,488
(sighs)

865
00:32:50,824 --> 00:32:53,192
JAKE: Well, I haven't seen
a Katy this sad since

866
00:32:53,227 --> 00:32:55,461
the Russell Brand breakup
scene in <i>Part of Me.</i>

867
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:57,062
I know. I'm sorry.

868
00:32:57,097 --> 00:32:59,698
I just can't believe
I wasn't allowed in there

869
00:32:59,732 --> 00:33:01,032
to watch your performance.

870
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:03,702
I've never been suspended
before.

871
00:33:03,736 --> 00:33:05,570
I've never even been
in trouble for anything.

872
00:33:05,605 --> 00:33:06,904
Well, I have.

873
00:33:06,939 --> 00:33:09,040
Plenty, actually.
Yeah, but...

874
00:33:09,074 --> 00:33:10,875
Hey, listen, why don't you
come over after school today?

875
00:33:10,909 --> 00:33:12,711
Okay? We'll do
something fun.

876
00:33:12,745 --> 00:33:13,945
My mom has <i>Mary Poppins</i> on DVD.

877
00:33:13,946 --> 00:33:14,946
(chuckles)

878
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,247
Thank you.

879
00:33:16,249 --> 00:33:18,616
Okay, I'll go home and
change first.

880
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,751
No, don't. I'm kind of digging
this whole Katy vibe.

881
00:33:20,818 --> 00:33:21,785
Seriously?

882
00:33:22,754 --> 00:33:23,787
Even the wig?

883
00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:26,423
Especially the wig.

884
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:28,626
Oh And my mom's working
a double shift,

885
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,827
so she won't be home
until way, way late.

886
00:33:30,862 --> 00:33:33,329
Um, sure.

887
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:58,320
(grunts) Jake, stop.

888
00:34:04,593 --> 00:34:05,726
(sighs)

889
00:34:05,761 --> 00:34:08,896
Can we have an honest
conversation about this?

890
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:11,965
The whole point to being
boyfriend/girlfriend

891
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,235
is that we hang out
and spend all this time together

892
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,571
so that we can appreciate
and trust each other.

893
00:34:17,606 --> 00:34:19,572
I totally appreciate
and trust you.

894
00:34:19,607 --> 00:34:20,767
And what better place is there

895
00:34:20,775 --> 00:34:23,443
to explore certain aspects
of ourselves than here?

896
00:34:23,477 --> 00:34:26,279
Are you telling me that the only
reason you hang out with me

897
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,948
and all that is just
so I'll let you touch my boobs?

898
00:34:28,982 --> 00:34:31,284
What? No. No, no.
Of course not.

899
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,386
But I feel like you won't even
consider it.

900
00:34:33,421 --> 00:34:35,721
Like you don't care
that it's bumming me out.

901
00:34:35,755 --> 00:34:37,956
Well, what do you want me to do? I
just don't want to be pressured

902
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,558
into doing something
I don't want to do!

903
00:34:39,592 --> 00:34:41,560
Who is pressuring you, Marley?

904
00:34:41,594 --> 00:34:42,628
I have been the most patient.

905
00:34:42,662 --> 00:34:43,729
The most understanding.

906
00:34:43,763 --> 00:34:45,464
I mean, I used
to stop calling a girl

907
00:34:45,498 --> 00:34:47,299
if she didn't let me
in her pants after six hours.

908
00:34:47,334 --> 00:34:49,935
Ugh! Then go be
with one of those girls!

909
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:51,602
Go! Have fun!

910
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,111
(sighs)

911
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,293
Hey.

912
00:35:17,328 --> 00:35:19,663
Do you... want to go somewhere?

913
00:35:20,732 --> 00:35:22,466
Where?

914
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,633
Someplace... private.

915
00:35:24,668 --> 00:35:26,068
Really private.

916
00:35:27,103 --> 00:35:29,605
A private part of the school?

917
00:35:30,674 --> 00:35:32,441
I like private parts.

918
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,778
Is your girlfriend going
to be there?

919
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:39,381
Do you want to go or not?

920
00:35:39,415 --> 00:35:41,315
(chuckles)

921
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,717
I'll get my coat.

922
00:35:42,752 --> 00:35:45,319
We'll need something
to lay on the ground.

923
00:35:45,354 --> 00:35:48,857
I don't want to get grass stains
on my uniform.

924
00:35:59,892 --> 00:36:04,059
What if we name our band
the Nipslips?

925
00:36:04,099 --> 00:36:05,532
Boob lovers of all genders

926
00:36:05,567 --> 00:36:07,335
will show up for sure.

927
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:09,236
Um, it worked
for the Barenaked Ladies.

928
00:36:09,271 --> 00:36:10,838
- And they were guys.
- Sure,

929
00:36:10,872 --> 00:36:12,573
we'll just call ourselves
the Areolas.

930
00:36:12,607 --> 00:36:15,241
Nope. Areola 51...
get the sci-fi geeks.

931
00:36:15,276 --> 00:36:16,542
I was being sarcastic.

932
00:36:16,577 --> 00:36:18,178
No, you were actually
just being the No-bot.

933
00:36:18,212 --> 00:36:20,013
How 'bout you pitch something
instead of shooting down

934
00:36:20,047 --> 00:36:21,381
everything that
we're coming up with?

935
00:36:21,415 --> 00:36:22,582
Okay, I don't have it yet.

936
00:36:22,616 --> 00:36:23,749
But I'll know it when I hear it.

937
00:36:23,784 --> 00:36:25,585
(sighs) (door slides open)

938
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:27,587
SANTANA: Oh, yo, girl.
How was rehearsal?

939
00:36:27,621 --> 00:36:29,889
It was sad.
I sang "My Man" all day,

940
00:36:29,923 --> 00:36:31,590
which was kind of depressing.

941
00:36:31,624 --> 00:36:33,592
Aw. We have comfort food
if you want a slice.

942
00:36:33,626 --> 00:36:34,893
No, I'm good.
What are you guys doing?

943
00:36:34,927 --> 00:36:36,628
Beating our heads up against
the wall trying to come up

944
00:36:36,662 --> 00:36:38,897
with a name for our band
that pleases the queen.

945
00:36:38,931 --> 00:36:41,233
(chuckles)
Why don't you call yourselves...

946
00:36:41,267 --> 00:36:43,102
Pamela Lansbury?

947
00:36:44,937 --> 00:36:46,705
No... I was kidding.

948
00:36:46,739 --> 00:36:48,572
Rachel, you're a genius.

949
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:51,675
A band with the raw sex appeal
of Pamela Anderson

950
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,843
and the quiet dignity

951
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,045
of Angela Lansbury.

952
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,513
Mm-hmm.
Okay, now you have to join.

953
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,415
No, I can't. I told you.

954
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:59,183
Rachel, I'm serious, okay?

955
00:36:59,218 --> 00:37:00,584
No more <i>Funny Girl</i> excuses.

956
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:02,420
When Barbra was doing Fanny,

957
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:03,420
she still had time to sing

958
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:04,521
for the President
and Ladybird Johnson,

959
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,689
pose for the cover
of <i>Tim</i> magazine,

960
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,058
and sing "Happy Days
Are Here Again"

961
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:10,093
to adoring nightclub audiences
all around the country.

962
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:11,561
Now, you can do this.

963
00:37:11,595 --> 00:37:14,398
Okay, you had me
at Ladybird Johnson.

964
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:15,432
Yes!
(everyone cheering)

965
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:17,067
- Yay!
- Yeah!

966
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:18,402
Okay.

967
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:19,768
Okay.

968
00:37:19,802 --> 00:37:21,237
Let's get to work.

969
00:37:21,271 --> 00:37:23,172
And that's why math and music

970
00:37:23,206 --> 00:37:24,573
will be friends to the end.

971
00:37:24,607 --> 00:37:25,574
(door opens) You guys!

972
00:37:25,608 --> 00:37:27,743
Throat Explosion
just tweeted out

973
00:37:27,777 --> 00:37:30,246
that they're doing "Applause" as
one of their Nationals numbers!

974
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,447
So? Big deal.

975
00:37:31,481 --> 00:37:32,515
We'll just do another
Lady Gaga song.

976
00:37:32,549 --> 00:37:33,582
They're mocking us.

977
00:37:33,616 --> 00:37:34,917
They're saying
they're so confident

978
00:37:34,951 --> 00:37:35,850
they're gonna win,
they're even gonna give us

979
00:37:35,884 --> 00:37:37,252
a little head start
by telling us

980
00:37:37,286 --> 00:37:38,453
what their set list is.

981
00:37:38,487 --> 00:37:40,588
Seriously!
We should just forfeit now.

982
00:37:40,622 --> 00:37:42,357
Guys, guys!
Just calm down.

983
00:37:42,391 --> 00:37:44,859
So our completion is good,
so was Vocal Adrenaline.

984
00:37:44,893 --> 00:37:45,793
And the Warblers.

985
00:37:45,827 --> 00:37:46,894
And thank God for that.

986
00:37:46,929 --> 00:37:48,530
If there's anything
we can learn

987
00:37:48,564 --> 00:37:49,797
from this week's lesson,

988
00:37:49,831 --> 00:37:50,631
it's that
other people's greatness

989
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:51,798
makes our greatness
even greater.

990
00:37:51,832 --> 00:37:53,400
Gaga and Katy,
they push each other

991
00:37:53,435 --> 00:37:55,735
to try harder, to get
better, to be bolder.

992
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,071
At the end of the day,

993
00:37:57,105 --> 00:37:58,572
all of the friendly
competition between those two

994
00:37:58,606 --> 00:38:01,341
just means more really
amazing music for all of us.

995
00:38:01,376 --> 00:38:03,577
I mean, I hope Throat Explosion
is unstoppable,

996
00:38:03,611 --> 00:38:06,746
because then we know
we have to be unstoppable too.

997
00:38:06,781 --> 00:38:08,081
You think he had that
in mind all week,

998
00:38:08,115 --> 00:38:09,682
or did he just make
it up on the spot?

999
00:38:09,716 --> 00:38:11,584
What are you talking about?
Mr. Shuester's a genius.

1000
00:38:11,618 --> 00:38:13,919
This week, we saw what it was
like to face our weaknesses

1001
00:38:13,954 --> 00:38:15,088
and turn them into strengths...
we split up.

1002
00:38:15,122 --> 00:38:16,422
But now, for our last number,

1003
00:38:16,457 --> 00:38:18,757
we are going to come together
as one unified group.

1004
00:38:18,792 --> 00:38:21,260
Oh... please let it be
another Journey song.

1005
00:38:21,295 --> 00:38:22,661
(laughs)
There's gotta be one left.

1006
00:38:22,696 --> 00:38:23,661
(laughing)

1007
00:38:23,696 --> 00:38:25,497
Hello, Glee Club.

1008
00:38:25,531 --> 00:38:27,765
- Hi, William.
- Sue.

1009
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,168
You know,
I was sitting in my office

1010
00:38:30,203 --> 00:38:32,036
organizing my collection of

1011
00:38:32,071 --> 00:38:33,572
custom-made bobble heads
of my sworn enemies,

1012
00:38:33,606 --> 00:38:36,341
and just to the right of
Henry Kissinger and Drake,

1013
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:39,510
well, I saw your hair helmet
just bobbling up and down

1014
00:38:39,544 --> 00:38:41,345
and I realized, well,
I haven't marched in here

1015
00:38:41,379 --> 00:38:44,014
and brought down the
hammer in way too long.

1016
00:38:44,048 --> 00:38:45,782
You're all suspended
for a week.

1017
00:38:45,817 --> 00:38:48,352
What? Wait, Sue,
you can't...

1018
00:38:48,386 --> 00:38:49,653
I can do that
and I just did it, William.

1019
00:38:49,687 --> 00:38:52,022
There are rules about what
kids can wear to school

1020
00:38:52,056 --> 00:38:54,458
and these rejects
from the cutting room floor

1021
00:38:54,493 --> 00:38:55,658
of a Tod Browning movie

1022
00:38:55,692 --> 00:38:56,959
are in violation of each
and every one of them.

1023
00:38:56,994 --> 00:38:58,128
Okay, what rules?
I mean,

1024
00:38:58,162 --> 00:38:59,462
the Glee Club has
been walking around

1025
00:38:59,497 --> 00:39:01,197
in costumes for four years.

1026
00:39:01,232 --> 00:39:03,799
Well, that was BS:
"Before Sue."

1027
00:39:03,834 --> 00:39:05,635
One week suspension,
starting now.

1028
00:39:05,669 --> 00:39:06,802
Sue, look it, look...

1029
00:39:06,837 --> 00:39:08,671
we have four weeks
to prepare for Nationals.

1030
00:39:08,705 --> 00:39:10,206
Right. We can't afford
to lose one of them.

1031
00:39:10,241 --> 00:39:11,806
You said yourself
you wanted us to win.

1032
00:39:11,841 --> 00:39:13,708
No, I said you have
to win to remain a club.

1033
00:39:13,743 --> 00:39:15,410
I don't actually want
you to win, William.

1034
00:39:15,445 --> 00:39:17,679
Are you seriously
starting up this feud again?

1035
00:39:17,713 --> 00:39:19,681
Oh, it never ended, William.

1036
00:39:19,715 --> 00:39:22,717
It's been hibernating like
