Uh, has anyone seen my tie?

4
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,100
You're wearing it, Dave.

00:01:52,167 --> 00:01:54,400
Uh, uh, thanks, Simon.

Don't forget your mittens,
Dave.

00:01:58,167 --> 00:01:59,634
It's cold in Europe.

And don't forget
your tour book.

10

I'm marking
all the great cities
you'll want to visit.

11

Great, Simon.

12
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:13,601
Now, let's see. Shirts,

Am I forgetting anything?

Alvin, we've been over this
a million times.

17
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:26,033
Please, Dave, I need
a little culture in my life.

18
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,200
The Eiffel tower,
the Sistine chapel,

19
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:30,934
the Louvre in Rome.

20
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:33,534
The Louvre is in Paris, Alvin.

21
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:36,834
You see, I don't even know
where the Louvre is.

22
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:39,968
Please. Take me with you,
Dave.

Alvin, for the last time.

24

This is strictly
a business trip.

25
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:46,934
It's just not practical.

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,901
Besides, I’ve hired someone
very good

our little wager?

to our lives.

Hey, Alvin,
look over here.

What is it, Simon?

1081
01:00:30,734 --> 01:00:33,567
It's ancient writing
that says,

1082
01:00:33,634 --> 01:00:36,300
"sacrifice the full moon

1083
01:00:36,367 --> 01:00:38,868
on the prince of plenty."

1084
01:00:38,934 --> 01:00:41,033
That doesn't make
any sense.

01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:43,801
[Laughing]
Oh, how silly of me.

1086
01:00:43,868 --> 01:00:47,801
It's "eyes" before "eats"
except after "tea."

1087
01:00:47,868 --> 01:00:49,868
I got it reversed.

1088
01:00:49,934 --> 01:00:53,834
It says, "sacrifice
the prince of plenty

1089
01:00:53,901 --> 01:00:55,634
on the full moon".

1090
01:01:00,868 --> 01:01:02,167
(both)
Oh, no.

1091
01:01:02,234 --> 01:01:05,767
They're going to sacrifice
Theodore tonight.

1092
01:01:05,834 --> 01:01:07,767

1094
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:14,334

Are there, uh, any,
uh, favorite songs

1099
01:01:30,467 --> 01:01:33,400
