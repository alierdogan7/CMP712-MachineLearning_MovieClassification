1
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,639
And God said,
"Let there be light,"

2
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,438
and there was light.

3
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,758
Brothers and sisters,
Iet us send our prayers to heaven.

4
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,559
Who will come forward and testify?

5
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,930
Today, on this very day,
who wants to wash their sins?

6
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,999
But you know, Willie,
if you work hard,

7
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,878
pray hard, do your studies,
you can do really well.

8
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:56,039
You know a priest
has the respect of everyone.

9
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,279
You want to be a priest,
don't you, Willie?

10
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,950
Yeah.

11
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,209
For the eyes of God sees all!

12
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,610
Hey, who are you styling up for?

13
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,170
No-one, Mum.

14
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,399
Dad's losing all his money again.

15
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,878
And Mum won't be very happy
when he gets home.

16
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,099
Check this.

17
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,878
Gerry, you gambling old bugger!
You wait till I get hold of you!

18
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,429
No-one's coming.

19
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,780
Rosie, I...

20
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,790
What?

21
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,839
Well, because this is my last night,

22
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,160
I thought that maybe...

23
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,878
Well, I mean...just...

24
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,318
Hello.

25
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,478
Hello.
Hello.

26
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,918
I just thought that...

27
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:36,119
Just wondering if you'd like to come
with me to the pictures?

28
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,040
What, like a date?

29
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,959
Well...no, no, not a date. Like,
well, we could sit together, maybe.

30
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,438
Willie, that's a date.

31
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:45,439
Oh. Well, yeah. OK.

32
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:16,509
Shh.

33
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,878
You're a deadly singer,
you know that?

34
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,758
You should come inside
and do a tune with the band.

35
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,049
I'm Lester.

36
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,910
Rosie.

37
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,269
Hi.

38
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,519
Er, I'm Willie.

39
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,878
Come on, Rosie, we've got to go.

40
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,278
Who is this? Your little brother?

41
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,179
No. No.

42
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,119
Ah, is he your boyfriend?

43
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,630
No.

44
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,599
Well, alright, then. I'll just be in there.

45
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,280
If you want me.

46
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,518
Why did you say we have to go?

47
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,239
Because we're not allowed in there.
Why not?

48
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,359
You know why not.

49
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,820
Alright, boys!

50
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,039
Come on. This is my big chance.

51
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,838
Well, I guess I'll see you
Iater then. At the pictures?

52
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,269
Willie!

53
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:01,079
Go on, Willie.
You run to your mum.

54
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,999
About time. Where you been?

55
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,910
Fishing.

56
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:16,078
Lord, we thank you
for all the gifts you give us.

57
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:20,278
Special prayers goes out to that
sinner cousin of mine, Johnny.

58
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:23,999
Please, Lord, help him
to stop drinking his life away

59
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,479
at that Roebuck Hotel.

60
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,479
May the Lord Jesus Christ
burn that house of sin down!

61
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,780
Sorry, Lord.

62
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,398
And please keep my son safe
while he is away in the city

63
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,398
and please help him, Lord,
not to be late

64
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,259
as it drives his mother mad.

65
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,790
Amen.

66
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:46,869
Amen.

67
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,110
Hi.

68
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,078
Hey, Rosie, where's Willie?

69
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,559
I don't know.

70
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,599
He wanna sit with you.

71
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,878
Where is Willie?

72
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,839
I don't know. He's gone fishing.

73
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,489
Hey, Lester boy!

74
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,678
Ah, Willie.
Welcome back to the city.

75
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,558
Thank you, Father Benedictus.

76
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:11,839
Come in, fellow.

77
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:19,119
How were your holidays?
Did you catch any fish?

78
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,678
Ah, one or two.

79
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,599
Perhaps you're not
praying hard enough.

80
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,758
Now, Willie...

81
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:27,798
Yes, Father?

82
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:30,359
I have been inspecting
my inventory of supplies.

83
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,798
You weren't one of those boys
drinking the altar wine last year,

84
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:33,798
were you, Willie?

85
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:34,798
No, Father.

86
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,019
Good. Good.

87
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,359
Because this year you are a prefect.

88
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,278
And as head student
you must set an example.

89
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,579
Yes, Father.

90
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:46,999
Mmm. I have great faith
in you, Willie.

91
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,300
Yes, Father.

92
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,638
How is your lovely mutter?

93
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,878
Good, Father.

94
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,599
She has high hopes in you.

95
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,319
You can become a very
successful individual, Willie.

96
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,758
You too can become close to God.

97
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,239
I can see it!

98
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,700
Willie, you can go forth
and help your Aborigine people.

99
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:16,038
They are crying in the wilderness.

100
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:18,798
You have so much to give the world.

101
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,398
So, my little friend, if you
knuckle down to some serious study

102
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,678
and pray hard -
not for me but for you -

103
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,069
you can become like me!

104
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,360
Oh, ja! Ja!

105
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:32,549
Ja.

106
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,540
Hey, Willie!

107
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,959
Where'd Willie go?

108
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,100
Whoo-whoo!

109
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,110
Rosie.

110
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,900
Here, catch!

111
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,158
Well,
I've got something for you too.

112
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,398
What, like a present...?

113
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:30,798
Honour thy father
and thy mother

114
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:33,239
that thy days may be long

115
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,719
upon the lands
which the Lord giveth thee.

116
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,558
Thou shall not kill.

117
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:40,119
Thou shall not...adultery.

118
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,638
Thou shall not steal.

119
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:45,558
Thou shall not bear false witness
against thy name

120
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:48,518
or covet thy neighbour's wife
or his...

121
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,380
Start again.

122
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:06,959
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

123
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,479
It has been two months
since my last confession.

124
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,999
What do you wish to confess, my son?

125
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,040
I have had thoughts
about a girl...um...

126
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,590
Thoughts? What thoughts?
Lustful thoughts?

127
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,660
Yes, Father.

128
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:31,230
You are a good boy. You will
overcome these sinful urges in time.

129
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:33,878
It is part of the hard road
to becoming a priest

130
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:36,189
that we all must face.

131
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,300
But, Father...

132
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,199
..I don't know if I'd be good
at being a priest.

133
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,719
You want to waste your life

134
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,758
like all those useless blackfellas
up in Broome?

135
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,879
No, Willie, you're
much better than that.

136
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,158
Your penance is 15 rosaries.

137
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,059
Now go.

138
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:45,999
- Willie!
- Rosie?

139
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,918
Rosie? It's Peter. Come on.

140
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:49,759
Go back to sleep.

141
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,638
Come on. We've got some hunting
to do tonight, boy.

142
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,239
What are you talking about?

143
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,878
The tuck shop. Shh, come on.

144
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:57,359
You're gonna get in trouble.

145
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,479
Come on, Willie.

146
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,558
- Hey. Hey, wake up.
- But I'm tired.

147
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:03,119
Shh. Shhh. Come on, let's go.

148
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,820
Come on, Willie. Let's go.

149
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,600
Come on, Willie.

150
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,480
Wait.

151
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,999
Let's go, let's go.

152
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,479
Hurry up.

153
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,679
Come on, come on, come on.

154
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,440
Keep an eye out.

155
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,719
"Thou shalt not steal"!

156
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,479
Thou shalt not starve either.

157
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,358
We should go back.

158
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,439
Food for our souls.
Now, what you want?

159
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,959
What are you doing?

160
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,660
Itemising every available
confection und beverage.

161
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,159
Oh, yum. Thank you, Lord.

162
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,439
Thank you, Lord.

163
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,719
And this is for
all the starving kids in the world.

164
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,518
Like us, bro. Us black kids are starving.

165
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:06,279
Ja, ja, ja!

166
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,679
Benny, Benny.

167
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,079
Benny's coming!

168
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:34,219
Let's go. Let's go.

169
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:38,999
My greatest desire is
to see you Aborigine people educated

170
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,758
and trained in the skills
of the modern world,

171
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:47,078
to become citizens of this great
country that is truly yours.

172
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:51,039
We have to show love
to these children.

173
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,210
Lux in tenebris -
light in the darkness!

174
00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:00,159
Yet, we all know there are
many evils in the world today.

175
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,220
For now, let us just talk
about theft and pillage -

176
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:07,479
sins of the flesh.

177
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:12,849
Tommy, will you not come up here?

178
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,798
I have been itemising supplies
from the canteen.

179
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:26,838
And to my surprise,
we are a little short.

180
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:29,118
Thou shalt not steal!

181
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:30,758
We're gonna get whacked.

182
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:36,919
Unless there is a confession,
I will be forced to punish Tommy.

183
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,159
Willie, I am very disappointed in you.

184
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,050
You are a prefect
and yet you throw it all away.

185
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:07,558
I had such great faith in you.

186
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:10,959
You are a rotten apple
in the barrel.

187
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,239
You are a stain
on the celebration of life.

188
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,310
You are an abomination in the eyes
of God! Put out your hand!

189
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,318
I should have known
one of your Aborigine kind

190
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:25,639
would be worth nothing!

191
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,118
That's not true, Father.

192
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:29,869
What?!

193
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,730
Run, Willie, run!

194
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,830
I will find the boy.

195
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:57,929
Hey, boy, where you bin come from?

196
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,358
This fire looks lovely and warm.

197
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:02,879
It's gonna be
a cold one tonight.

198
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,999
Come here. We're not gonna eat you.
Well, not yet, anyway.

199
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,558
Come here. Come here. Sit down.

200
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,509
Relax. Come here, young fella.

201
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,919
I got nowhere to stay.

202
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,919
Any of you mob got anywhere to stay?

203
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,380
Nope.

204
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,278
You in good company here, boy.

205
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:25,959
I wanna go home.

206
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,278
Well, we all wanna go home, eh?

207
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:31,439
But we're a long, long way away
from our country.

208
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:19,049
Yeah, yeah!

209
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:19,909
Hey!

210
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:25,479
Where your home, boy?

211
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:26,349
Broome.

212
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:29,299
Hmm. That's my home too.

213
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,390
True?

214
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:32,229
True.

215
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,399
Here, I'll tell you a story.

216
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,080
Oh, here we go.

217
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,959
I been away 15 years now.

218
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,959
15 years?

219
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,038
Shut up, boy. Let me tell you
the story. Right?

220
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:44,639
I been drinking, I been droving,

221
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,879
I've been a Christian,
I've been everything.

222
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,038
But now I reckon it's time
that I went home before I die.

223
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:54,999
Yep, I'd better go back home to Broome.

224
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,530
Yep, yep, yep.

225
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,118
But you still never tell me
your name.

226
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:03,829
My name is William Johnson.

227
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:06,318
My name is Steven Johnson.

228
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:09,799
I'm your uncle.

229
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:14,349
I reckon your mummy
must be my sister brother

230
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:18,719
and I bin call him sister
but she bin call you uncle.

231
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,239
So that's how come
I'm your sist...sist...sist...

232
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,518
Yeah, I'm your uncle, OK?!

233
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,460
Uncle Tadpole.

234
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,940
Uncle Tadpole.

235
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:33,229
Hey, you got any tucker?

236
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,318
Now, what they bin doing to you,
boy? They bin hit you?

237
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:41,239
No. I've been running
from boarding school.

238
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,598
How come?
What you been doing wrong?

239
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:45,598
I don't wanna talk about it.

240
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,199
They been starving you, hey?

241
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,639
Yeah, that's the trouble.

242
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,758
You never get enough tucker,
you never get enough beer

243
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:55,038
and you never get
enough womans, eh?

244
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,598
No, Uncle...no.

245
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:58,078
I know you young fellas!

246
00:26:58,079 --> 00:26:59,879
You been rootin' round here,
rootin' round there,

247
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,358
rootin' round everywhere!

248
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:03,358
No, Uncle, I feel sorry now.

249
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:04,838
I gotta go see my mum,

250
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:07,078
but when she find out
I'm running from school,

251
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:08,798
she gonna be real wild.

252
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,239
Well, I bin fix
your mummy up for you.

253
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,479
I know how to fix up womans.

254
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:20,118
I'm gonna take this boy
home to Broome,

255
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:24,159
home to his dear mother,
away from this place.

256
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,630
Yeah, yeah, good on you.

257
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,639
OK, let's go.

258
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,679
Wake up, Uncle.
Time to go. Wake up.

259
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,050
Who are you?

260
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,610
Your nephew. Remember?

261
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,099
Nah. Nah.

262
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:07,399
You said we're going to Broome.

263
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,999
Why would I wanna go to Broome?

264
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,480
But you promised me you'd take me.

265
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:23,758
Um, we can't go anywhere
without any...any cash.

266
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:26,379
You got any money on you?

267
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:33,749
Well, come on, boy. You can't go
nowhere without money, you know?

268
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:40,839
Where are we going?

269
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:43,319
Where do you think?

270
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,660
In here.

271
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,850
And a bottle?

272
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:09,358
What did you do with my money?

273
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:11,639
You bought grog with it, eh?!

274
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,950
Give me back my money.

275
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:17,078
That's my money, not yours. Mine!

276
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:19,318
You're not going to take me
to Broome, are you?

277
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:22,489
You're just an old drunken bum!

278
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:26,919
I'll find my own way back to Broome.
I don't want anything to do with you!

279
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,810
You ready, kid?

280
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:07,118
Look out!

281
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,719
Oh...my...God.
We've run over an Aborigine!

282
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:28,179
Oh, my God. What have we done?
It's OK.

283
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,399
Old man, are you alright?

284
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,159
Don't touch him. Don't touch him.

285
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,450
Are you OK?

286
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:39,278
I don't speak Aborigine!

287
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,499
Me neither.

288
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,770
We...will...take...you...
to the hospital.

289
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,199
I don't want to go no hospital.

290
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,758
Where do you wanna go then?

291
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:53,219
I want to go to Broome!

292
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,399
Annie?

293
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,860
Yes, Slippery.

294
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,358
Where's Broome?

295
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,758
It's not far up here.
It won't take long.

296
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,679
And so you come
from Broome, do you?

297
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,920
I was born...

298
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:20,779
..in the midst of the Dreamtime.

299
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:24,609
My mother is from the crocodile mob

300
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,680
and my...my father...
is...um, koala bear.

301
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,639
And, um, where are you from?

302
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,239
Me. Er, I am from Germany.

303
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,679
I have come to
the land of your people

304
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,719
to make a visit with my father.

305
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,318
And also I am on a vision quest.

306
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,639
Yeah, we follow Buddha.

307
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:53,669
That's proper...proper rude word
in our language!

308
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,598
You don't look so bad now.
Maybe you are better.

309
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:02,189
Well, what you talking about?
Just look at me!

310
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,798
I think we might drop you off
somewhere, old man.

311
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,329
Oh, no.

312
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:10,078
You hear that, Willie?

313
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:14,078
They just gonna dump us
by the side of the road.

314
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:14,589
No!

315
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,919
Do you know it's bad karma to knock
over an Aborigine with a Kombi van?

316
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,278
Yeah, you could get the bone
pointed at you.

317
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,038
Proper bad thing that.

318
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,399
The bone?
Yeah.

319
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,959
And when you have children,
they will look like...like...

320
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,870
Wombats.

321
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,838
Hairy nosed wombats.

322
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:33,598
Slippery,
I think this was meant to be.

323
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:35,719
We were meant to help these people.

324
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,879
And they will show us
their country first-hand.

325
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,798
What better experience
than to do that with you

326
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:43,479
and these two black people.

327
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,850
I mean, native people -
A...Aborigine people.

328
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,919
People that understand you and me.

329
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,590
Yeah.

330
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:54,879
Annie, we don't even know
these people

331
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,199
and we are meant to visit my father.

332
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,798
Anyway, how far exactly is Broome?

333
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:01,249
Not far!

334
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:03,278
Slippery, if you want to be a hippie,

335
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,439
you gotta stop
acting so bloody square!

336
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,879
Yeah, square.
OK.

337
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,879
These maps with their lines
and their numbers,

338
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,518
they just fence us in, man.

339
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:12,399
They cramp our inner selves.

340
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,518
We don't need maps, Slippery,
we have an Aboriginal elder!

341
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:18,989
Who?
Not...not the map!

342
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:25,559
OK, so we drop them off in Broome.

343
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,919
It's just up the road.

344
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,639
16 years old.
School uniform. You seen him?

345
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,038
Willie, you say?

346
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:42,159
No, he ain't been around here.

347
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,080
You seen a Willie?

348
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:47,078
Oh, that is a shame

349
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:51,679
because I need to return this boy
to his poor mother.

350
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,130
Such a shame.

351
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,979
Actually...
Hmm?

352
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,030
..there was one young fella.

353
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,078
He said he was taking off to Broome.

354
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:03,909
Broome?

355
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,340
Thank you.

356
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,238
Hey, sing along, sing along!

357
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:46,219
Shut up.

358
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:52,319
He can't sing, that fella.

359
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,260
G'day.

360
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,300
Coke, please.

361
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,270
Nothing else take your fancy?

362
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,910
We got hot sausage rolls,

363
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:35,238
hot roast beef rolls.

364
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:37,319
And hot Chiko rolls.

365
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,460
Whoo, it's hot in here!

366
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:46,319
Can I have a hot Chiko roll, please?

367
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,260
Um, well, a chicken sandwich then.

368
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:58,999
Uncle! Uncle, what are you doing?

369
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,638
Uncle, don't touch anything.

370
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:04,078
What are you doing?

371
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,078
Here, put it in your boonyah. Go on!

372
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,939
It's cold. Stop. Stop. Oooh!

373
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,149
I'll have that.

374
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:17,678
Oh, OK, money.
Here we go.

375
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:19,989
What's wrong with him?

376
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:20,989
Nothing.

377
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,319
Run! Come on.
Quick! Crank it up.

378
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,040
Drive! Drive, hippie, drive!

379
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,000
Go, go, go, go!

380
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:36,969
In there, quick! Come on! Come on!

381
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,119
Annie! Wait for me!

382
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,650
Wait for me!

383
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:44,399
Jump! Jump! Jump!

384
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:54,439
You should have seen you...

385
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,999
See what you've done?
Look what this is.

386
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,238
Hey, look what I got, eh?

387
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:00,919
Who likes Rolf Harris?

388
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,880
I hate Rolf Harris!
Who is Rolf Harris?

389
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:22,749
Om.

390
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:29,979
Om.

391
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:34,198
You want a sausage?

392
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:36,509
But stealing is a sin.

393
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:42,689
Well, you can either be a sinner
or you can starve.

394
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,070
He is right, old man.

395
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:47,399
Stealing is very, very wrong.

396
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,090
Shut up, Buddha.

397
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,799
Your stealing nearly get us killed!

398
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,100
Me - killed!

399
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,638
My girlfriend - killed!

400
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:58,399
He just wants to feed us.

401
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,678
Got plenty of tucker here.

402
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:02,389
We must respect their ways.

403
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,959
I wish I had never met you.

404
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:07,459
These flies!

405
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:10,579
Flies...

406
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,900
Slippery. Wait.

407
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:17,449
Slippery. Slippery, wait.

408
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:26,879
So, would you like to come out back
in the kitchen

409
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,180
for a hot cup of tea?

410
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:35,349
No. Actually,
I'm in a big hurry. Thanks.

411
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,760
You got a woman?

412
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,279
Well, I got this girl, Rosie...

413
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,030
Rosie.

414
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,390
Yeah, she back in Broome.

415
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:58,669
She different one from me.

416
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:04,849
But, like, I don't know
if she like me, Uncle.

417
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,399
"But...I don't know
if she like me, Uncle."

418
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,279
When you find them,
you gotta grab them.

419
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,279
Grab them?

420
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,970
Yeah, grab them.

421
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:17,489
Look, look, look.

422
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,070
See, when God made man

423
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,280
and God made woman,

424
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:26,759
he made them different, see?

425
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:31,158
And when they bin
find each other, they do this.

426
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:32,459
You never...

427
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:39,449
Well, I won't tell anyone, then.

428
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,678
Thank you, Uncle.

429
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:44,319
Willie, a virgin.

430
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:51,349
Willie's a virgin.

431
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:01,718
I can't take it anymore, Annie.

432
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,549
It's me or them.

433
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,690
Have you got another one of these?

434
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,500
Useless hippie.

435
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,380
Hello.

436
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,759
What kind of people

437
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:28,920
would leave folks lying out here
in the middle of nowhere, hmm?

438
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,558
The beginning
of a new life cycle.

439
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:41,209
Energy, happiness, optimism.

440
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,558
The overturning of the status quo
or current states

441
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:46,969
by unexpected happenings.

442
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:49,038
Important decisions to be made.

443
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:53,319
The seven of wands reversed.
Indecision and retreat.

444
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,359
A lack of decisiveness

445
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,919
which causes the challenge
to be lost through hesitation.

446
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,950
Giving in just as the end
was in sight.

447
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:10,789
What are you doing?

448
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,279
Where are you going?
I'm going to Broome.

449
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,850
Jump in.
We're gonna play football.

450
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:21,939
Hello, boys.

451
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,600
Willie. Don't go.

452
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:01,939
Ah! Scheisse!

453
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:15,598
Mate, this is gonna hurt me
more than it's gonna hurt you.

454
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,320
Welcome to Port Hedland.

455
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:12,429
Proper deadly place this one.

456
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:18,718
Hey, Coach!
What happened to Broome?

457
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:21,558
Broome?
Yeah, when we beat Port Hedland.

458
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:23,799
Then we'll take you Broome

00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,450
Come on.
Come and have some Chinese.

460
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,659
Come on.

461
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,930
Hey, excuse me.

00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,460
Yeah, you.

463
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:11,559
What's your name?

464
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,879
I'm Roxanne.

465
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:16,529
I'm Willie.

466
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,598
Where you come from, Willie?

467
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:21,769

What you doing here all on your own?

00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,559
Er, just passing through.

474
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,638
You wanna come drink with us?

475
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,709
Umm...I don't know.

476
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,638
Don't you drink? Are you underage?

477
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:56,009
No, I drink.

478
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:00,459

I'll show you a condom tree.

00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,930
Yeah.

483
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,718
You look like...an angel.

484
00:49:41,719 --> 00:49:43,179
Yeah?

485
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,550
Yeah.

486
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,450
A black angel.

487
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,560
Well...that's what
I am, Willie.

00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:04,380

What? How did you find me?

00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,799
All young fellas end up here

503
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,518
Hey, Willie, we're going
to Broome, we're going to Broome.

Even Slippery want to go to Broome.

00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,158
Ja. We go to Broome.
It's just up the road, yeah?

506
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:12,829
Yeah.

507
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:17,329
Oh. That's OK. That's OK.

00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:34,420
Ah, Broome, ich komme. Ahh, ja.

It's good, ja?

Roxanne?

511
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,799
How hard is it for a woman
to get some sleep back here?

512
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,238
How did you get in my van?

513
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:57,539
Black magic.

514
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:02,879
Hey! Tell ya, that old town gonna

515
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:20,559
What is a boomer?

00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,879
It's a bloody big kangaroo.

517
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,989
And who is Rolf Harris?

518
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,238
Is he an Aborigine like you?

519
00:52:29,239 --> 00:52:31,238
Yeah. He's my cousin's brother.

520
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:35,889
Hey.
What am I? Hmm?

521
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,399
I don't know.

522
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,840
I'm a koala.

523
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,799
We are in the Dreamtime!

524
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,820
Hey, watch out for those roos!

525
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:50,199
Don't touch the wheel. Don't touch.

526
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,980
Um...um, cops. Um...um...police.

527
00:52:55,559 --> 00:52:56,839
Police, you stupid hippie!

528
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,678
Quick, chuck me the stuff!
Shut up, you.

529
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:00,678
I will do the talking.
Now look what you've done!

530
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:02,319
Shut up, you two! Shut up!

531
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,399
Pull over.

532
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,078
Why do they persecute us?

533
00:53:05,079 --> 00:53:07,319
We're free. We're just trying
to have a good time!

534
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,300
Shut up.

535
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,799
We're free, we're free
and we'll always be free!

536
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,319
Shut up!

537
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,620
What?

538
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:21,558
I don't even know these people.

539
00:53:21,559 --> 00:53:25,399
I only met them yesterday.
That is right, ja?

540
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,070
Yeah.

541
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,319
I was on my way to visit my father

542
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,678
when that man
jumped in front of my van.

543
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,320
What's your name?

544
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,260
Wolfgang Benedictus.

545
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:41,399
And how do you spell that, Adolph?

546
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,900
B-E-N-E-D-I-C-T-U-S.

547
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,999
You cannot hold me here.
My father is a priest.

548
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,540
He will come and get me.

549
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:53,779
Thank you.

550
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:05,118
Yes, hello, um, I wish to speak
to Father Benedictus.

551
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:07,198
I'm sorry,
that's not possible. He's gone.

552
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:08,419
Gone?
Yes.

553
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,518
Gone where?

554
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:12,759
He's travelling to Broome
on school business.

555
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:13,900
Thank you.

556
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:26,569
He is on his way to Broome.

557
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:30,158
Get off him. Get off him.

558
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:32,598
Annie, Annie. Stop it!
What are you doing?

559
00:54:32,599 --> 00:54:34,599
Don't get involved.

560
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,158
Annie! Stop it! Annie! Annie!

561
00:54:37,159 --> 00:54:38,959
Get off him!

562
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:43,518
Get off him, Annie!
What are you doing? Stop it!

563
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:45,359
Get off him! Hey!

564
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,999
Get off me! Annie!

565
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:49,750
Annie!

566
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,540
This is not fair at all!

567
00:54:54,519 --> 00:54:56,129
Just get... Oh!

568
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,038
Just come in. Just... Willie.

569
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,330
Oh! Get off!

570
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,799
Stop struggling, Annie.

571
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:06,790
Willie...

572
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,230
Willie!

573
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:13,909
This is physical harassment, man.

574
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:18,718
Not cool at all.

575
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:20,479
Not cool at all!

576
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,300
Uncle, blackfellas die in jail, eh?

577
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,680
Come on.
You get some sleep. Come on.

578
00:57:57,559 --> 00:58:03,169
Come on, Willie.
Wake up. Wake up, boy. Wake up.

579
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,500
Last night I had a dream.

580
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:18,969
There were bush people here,
with you.

581
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,450
But it wasn't here, it was...

582
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:28,639
..it was somewhere else.

583
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,280
Those are the old people,
Iooking after us.

584
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:40,489
You alright? Hey?

585
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,059
Nothing broken?

586
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:46,350
No. It's not that.

587
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,999
Slippery's father
is Father Benedictus.

588
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,439
He's going to go tell Mum about me,
that I'm a sinner and a thief

589
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,479
and, well, now I won't be able
to go back to Broome.

590
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,598
And I won't be able
to go back to Clontarf.

591
00:58:58,599 --> 00:59:00,479
I'll have nowhere to go.

592
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,780
I'll end up like you!

593
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,959
Your mummy will forgive you.

594
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,598
You don't know my mum.

595
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:15,359
Well...I'll fix it
with your mum then.

596
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:18,638
Don't you worry about that.
I'll talk to her about it.

597
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:23,078
What we got to do is beat that
mongrel Father Benedictus to Broome.

598
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,940
OK, you can go now.

599
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,090
Come on, Willie.

600
00:59:43,639 --> 00:59:45,118
Come on, Willie.

601
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:47,158
Stand up. Come on, Willie.

602
00:59:47,159 --> 00:59:47,989
Willie?

603
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:53,740
Get up!

604
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:05,390
Hey.

605
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,630
We're going to Broome.

606
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,460
Today is a bran nue dae.

607
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,740
Come on, boy. Let's go.

608
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,678
See, I told you
it's just up the road.

609
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:53,598
So where do we go now?

610
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:55,879
Turn here, turn here, turn here.
We go to Roebuck first.

611
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,879
I need a drink.

612
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:00,900
You and me both, fella.
Yeah.

613
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:12,439
Let me out! Let me out!

614
01:01:14,039 --> 01:01:15,518
The Roey Hotel!

615
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:17,959
But, Uncle, you promised.
Wait, Uncle!

616
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:21,799
It's been a long time between drinks
and I'll talk to your mummy later,

617
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,598
but now, just one drink,
just one little drink.

618
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:29,359
Hey! Roxanne, here
for a proper good time!

619
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,038
Willie, Willie!

620
01:02:46,039 --> 01:02:48,279
Get up, get up!
Come on. Come on, Willie!

621
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:50,799
Come here. Come on, get up, man.

622
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,839
Get up, get up, get up.
What's wrong with you?

623
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,598
That's him there.

624
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:56,809
Who's him?

625
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,530
Oh, Lordy, Lordy!

626
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:11,270
Willie!

627
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,638
Now you can find him, you wanna
get up there and grab him.

628
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:16,158
But I feel big shame. I'm dirty.

629
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:18,469
We all dirty. Come on.

630
01:03:21,159 --> 01:03:21,749
Yes!

631
01:03:28,159 --> 01:03:33,149
Hello, my dear. My name is Tadpole.
Steven Johnson.

632
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,740
Uncle Tadpole.

633
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:38,118
And this here my boy...
Well, he was here.

634
01:03:38,119 --> 01:03:39,598
What's his name?

635
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:40,429
Willie.

636
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,740
Willie?
Yeah.

637
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,260
And he want to see you.

638
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:53,699
Well, you can tell Willie
that he's too late.

639
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:04,279
Hello, Willie.

640
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:05,660
Hello, Rosie.

641
01:04:12,199 --> 01:04:13,678
Well, I'd better go now.

642
01:04:13,679 --> 01:04:15,919
Hey, wait. I wanna talk to you.

643
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,140
What about?

644
01:04:18,719 --> 01:04:20,198
Excuse me, who are you?

645
01:04:20,199 --> 01:04:22,279
Oh...I remember now.

646
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,870
You're that little boy.

647
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:30,319
Rosie's little friend.

648
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,118
Rosie, leave us.

649
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:32,869
What?!

650
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,799
I said get out.

651
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:40,240
Hey, don't talk to her like that.

652
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:43,360
Listen, Lester. Just move.

653
01:04:46,119 --> 01:04:47,579
Rosie.

654
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:53,509
Alright, everyone, last drinks!

655
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,198
Rosie, wait. Rosie! Rosie!

656
01:04:56,199 --> 01:05:01,399
Hey, I told you, didn't I?
Stay away from my woman.

657
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,439
- Willie!
- No, let it go.

658
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:05,500
Stand up!

659
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,518
Willie! Willie!

660
01:05:12,519 --> 01:05:15,319
Hey, Willie! Give him
the old one-two-three, Willie!

661
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:26,719
Willie, watch out!

662
01:05:28,679 --> 01:05:30,219
Willie. Willie.

663
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:32,999
Willie, say something.

664
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,718
Talk to me. Say something.

665
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,920
I love you, Rosie.

666
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:39,299
Oh, Willie.

667
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,678
Quick, Willie.
Your mum's coming. Get up.

668
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:21,198
Brothers and sisters!
Tonight, it's the night of miracles!

669
01:06:21,199 --> 01:06:22,439
Hallelujah!

670
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,319
Come and be reborn.

671
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,319
Be reborn.
Yes!

672
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,118
Leave this house of sin!

673
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,038
Leave this house of sin.
Leave it.

674
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:31,279
Come and join us, sister!

675
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:34,670
Come.

676
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:37,749
Come and join us, sister.

677
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:41,140
Come and join us, sister, brother.

678
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:56,140
Why don't you let a proper Kimberley
woman show you proper good time?

679
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:00,799
I thought you were ashamed of me.

680
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:04,050
I could never be ashamed of you.

681
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:31,880
Do you believe?

682
01:07:32,199 --> 01:07:33,439
We believe.

683
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:36,078
Tonight is the night of miracles.

684
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:36,669
Yes!

685
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:41,638
Are there anyone among you
who wants to testify?

686
01:07:41,639 --> 01:07:45,679
I can feel
that someone need to testify.

687
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:50,238
I wanna testify.
Shut up, Annie.

688
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:52,118
Are you a sinner, woman?

689
01:07:52,119 --> 01:07:56,078
Oh, yes. I've been a bad person.
I've been bent on free love.

690
01:07:56,079 --> 01:07:58,558
I had a child out of wedlock
when I was 16

691
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:01,198
and I gave it away
and I'm not worthy.

692
01:08:01,199 --> 01:08:04,359
I'm a sinner and I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

693
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,718
Let's sing it one more time
for our sister.

694
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:17,230
I too have lost a child
and I too have been a sinner.

695
01:08:18,079 --> 01:08:21,089
I had a child to another man.

696
01:08:21,479 --> 01:08:23,999
Behold! A vision from God!

697
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:37,358
We are all sinners, my children.

698
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:40,118
We are all angels und devils.

699
01:08:40,119 --> 01:08:43,759
Lux in tenebris!
Light in the darkness.

700
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:46,799
I had a child to that man there!

701
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:53,059
He took my child away to Germany
20 years ago.

702
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,120
Mein vater! Mein vater!

703
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:02,089
Wolfgang? My son?

704
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:04,460
My son!

705
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,158
My father.

706
01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:09,659
Wolfy, this is your mother, Theresa.

707
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:16,169
Well, not the Mother Theresa,
but she is your mother Theresa.

708
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,180
Hello, Theresa.

709
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,140
Meine Mutter?

710
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,900
Meine Mutter?

711
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,300
Meine Mutter?

712
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:31,119
My son? My son!

713
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:34,470
My prayers have been answered.

714
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:37,310
Willie, you have a brother.

715
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,839
I am an Aborigine!

716
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:55,679
I got a story to tell
if anyone wanna listen.

717
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,639
When I was young I got married,

718
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:02,599
but my wife
had a child to another man.

719
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,070
Where is that woman now?

720
01:10:06,039 --> 01:10:08,278
That's her right there.

721
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,930
Steven? Steven Johnson.

722
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:17,879
He's returned to be saved!

723
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,398
No more drinking.
No more loose women.

724
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:21,999
No, no, no. Hang on a minute.

725
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,999
I never meant to do it, Steven.

726
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,540
It was the devil's work.

727
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,078
Where are you going?

728
01:10:31,079 --> 01:10:32,639
I need a drink.

729
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,799
You don't need a drink, Steven.
Wait for me!

730
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:35,550
Mutti?

731
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:37,358
Wait for me, Steven!

732
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:39,519
Wait for me! My mutti!

733
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,080
Mutti, please wait! Mutti!

734
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:43,820
Mum?

735
01:10:44,319 --> 01:10:46,959
Willie? What are doing here?

736
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,799
You're meant to be in school.
Did you bring him?

737
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:50,310
No.

738
01:10:51,399 --> 01:10:52,839
I ran away from Clontarf.

739
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,519
You run away?!

740
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:58,679
I work like a dog for you
to study hard and be a priest

741
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:00,238
and you run away?!

742
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:02,358
And what are you doing
with that girl?!

743
01:11:02,359 --> 01:11:04,238
Have you turned your back on God?

744
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:05,519
No, Mum, I haven't.

745
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,719
Oh, Lord. Have you lost your faith?

746
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,719
No, Mum, I just don't want
to be a priest.

747
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,278
I don't understand.

748
01:11:12,279 --> 01:11:13,919
What do you want, Willie?

749
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,290
I want this!

750
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:18,158
To be at home,
under the stars, fishing,

751
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:22,109
to be with you and with my girl, Rosie.

752
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:27,939
God is here. This is heaven.

753
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:37,038
Well, you better talk to your father
about what he thinks.

754
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:41,198
No, not that Father, your father -
Steven Johnson Tadpole.

755
01:11:42,279 --> 01:11:43,109
Willie?

756
01:11:43,319 --> 01:11:44,779
Uncle Tadpole?

757
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:50,830
Willie.

758
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,940
Mein brother!

759
01:11:57,159 --> 01:12:00,198
We are all one in the eyes of God.

760
01:12:00,199 --> 01:12:03,158
We thank the Lord
for everything he provides

761
01:12:03,159 --> 01:12:04,999
and for watching over his flock.

762
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:05,670
Amen.

763
01:12:06,079 --> 01:12:07,078
Amen.

764
01:12:07,079 --> 01:12:09,278
Come on, you mob,
soup's getting cold.

765
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,198
Actually,
I've got another confession.

766
01:12:14,199 --> 01:12:16,959
I was adopted out as a child.

767
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:21,438
All I remember is being pulled
from a sea of wailing black faces

768
01:12:21,439 --> 01:12:24,038
and being raised in the city
to be white.

769
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:28,679
Yeah, I'm one of you guys.
I'm an Aborigine too.

770
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:31,300
You've got to be kidding.

771
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:36,670
Today, everyone's an Aborigine!

772
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:37,980
Yeah!

773
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:54,559
This song is called 'Millya
Rumarra' which means bran nue dae.

774
01:19:08,039 --> 01:19:13,029
This fella song is all about
the Aboriginal people.

775
01:19:13,319 --> 01:19:14,939
Coloured people.

776
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,640
Black people, long Australia.

777
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:19,278
Other day I bin go along
to social security.

778
01:20:19,279 --> 01:20:21,659
I bin asked for a job.

779
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:26,720
They bin say,
"What's your working experience?"

780
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,879
I bin tell them I got nothing.

781
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,719
They say, "How come?"

782
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:59,450
Yeah, they bin talk about this kind,

783
01:21:00,239 --> 01:21:03,419
that kind, any kind, every kind.

784
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:07,000
But still same kind.

785
01:21:07,319 --> 01:21:09,789
And, boy, make me slack.

786
01:21:16,199 --> 01:21:18,119
Bran nue dae. Mmm.
