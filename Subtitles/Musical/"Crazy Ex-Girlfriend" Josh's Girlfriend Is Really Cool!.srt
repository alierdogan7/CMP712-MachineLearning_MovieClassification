- What's the deal with you and Josh?

9
00:00:17,696 --> 00:00:19,229
Josh isn't my type.

10
00:00:20,867 --> 00:00:22,534

11
00:00:22,536 --> 00:00:25,170

- I should go.

Yeah.

Now, that's a good look.

40
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,720
- So I've been thinking about it... 
- Yes?

41
00:01:14,722 --> 00:01:16,471
And there could be, like,

42
00:01:16,473 --> 00:01:18,674
a million reasons why
Josh hasn't texted me back.

43
00:01:18,676 --> 00:01:20,625
Look, he specifically wrote in his text:

44
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,265
“Want to grab dinner? Smiley face.”

45
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,206
Which is the least he
can do, since you left

46
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:27,365
your great job and moved
to this dump to be with him.

47
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,289
Hey! I didn't move here for him, remember?

48
00:01:29,314 --> 00:01:30,614
I moved here because I needed a change

49
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:32,170
and Josh just happens to be here.

50
00:01:32,195 --> 00:01:33,171
Get it straight.

51
00:01:33,196 --> 00:01:36,113
Oh, are we still doing that? Okay.

52
00:01:36,193 --> 00:01:38,143
All right, just let me know
when we can stop, because

53
00:01:38,145 --> 00:01:40,420
I actually want to know what's keeping him

54
00:01:40,445 --> 00:01:41,670
from having dinner with his dear old friend

55
00:01:41,696 --> 00:01:43,571
- from summer camp. 
- I don't know.

56
00:01:43,595 --> 00:01:45,898
- What are you... Don't do that.
- Let's see what he's been up to.

57
00:01:45,923 --> 00:01:48,473
- You can't take a person's personal 
electronic... - I just did

58
00:01:48,498 --> 00:01:50,281
Oh, look at this.

59
00:01:50,306 --> 00:01:51,906
What? Wait, wait, wait.
Has he updated his status

60
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:52,992
in the last 20 minutes?

61
00:01:53,711 --> 00:01:54,812
Not that I've been checking, I was...

62
00:01:54,837 --> 00:01:57,007
Checking? Oh, that is amateur hour.

63
00:01:57,032 --> 00:01:59,032
You gotta change your
push notifications. Look.

64
00:01:59,057 --> 00:02:01,460
He is going to a club called Spiders

65
00:02:01,485 --> 00:02:03,101
with his friends tonight.

66
00:02:03,126 --> 00:02:05,093
And so, we will, too.

67
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:07,068
Spiders. I drove by there the other night.

68
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:08,342
It was hopping.

69
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:09,482
But I always wonder, though,

70
00:02:09,507 --> 00:02:10,523
is it possessive Spider's

71
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:11,631
or plural Spiders?

72
00:02:11,656 --> 00:02:13,405
Because every time I see a flyer for it,

73
00:02:13,406 --> 00:02:15,223
the apostrophe's in a different location.

74
00:02:15,484 --> 00:02:16,691
What difference does it make?

75
00:02:16,693 --> 00:02:17,892
It doesn't make a
difference, it's just, like,

76
00:02:17,894 --> 00:02:19,027
it's two different things.

77
00:02:19,029 --> 00:02:21,079
Like, either the club is owned by a spider

78
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:23,364
or the club is filled with,
like, a bunch of spiders.

79
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:24,532
So... it's a different thing.

80
00:02:24,534 --> 00:02:26,067
Okay, let's go back to
what you were saying.

81
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:27,068
You know what?

82
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,119
I actually really like your idea.

83
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:29,087
Let's go to Spider's tonight.

84
00:02:29,089 --> 00:02:30,421
(gasps) Just, like, as a gal date.

85
00:02:30,423 --> 00:02:32,040
Like, not-not 'cause Josh is there.

86
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:33,407
In fact, I hope Josh isn't there,

87
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:36,177
so that when I do my sexy

88
00:02:36,179 --> 00:02:37,762
dance moves, it's just for me.

89
00:02:37,764 --> 00:02:39,297
It's just for me.

90
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:41,299
(dance music playing)

91
00:02:44,773 --> 00:02:45,545
Oh!

92
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,609
Hey!

93
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:48,500
Hi. Cool hat.

94
00:02:48,525 --> 00:02:49,891
Hats are the new tattoos.

95
00:02:49,893 --> 00:02:50,775

96
00:02:50,777 --> 00:02:51,859
Let's go find Josh.

97
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:53,117
Okay, well, you can find Josh

98
00:02:53,142 --> 00:02:54,593
and I'll be in there just checking out

99
00:02:54,618 --> 00:02:56,401
the local indigenous culture. Uh-huh.

100
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,093
Well, while you're in there chatting

101
00:02:58,118 --> 00:02:59,751
about the majestic
history of the 10 freeway,

102
00:02:59,776 --> 00:03:01,559
I'm gonna be asking Josh Chan

103
00:03:01,584 --> 00:03:03,300
why he's been dodging you.

104
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,476
See, now, there it's possessive.

105
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:10,147
PAULA: Yo...

106
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:11,648
You see my hat?

107
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,183
It's like a tattoo,

108
00:03:13,687 --> 00:03:15,402
but on my head.

109
00:03:15,968 --> 00:03:17,154
(whispers): Let us in.

110
00:03:17,335 --> 00:03:18,989
You on the list, Mrs. Butterworth?

111
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,908
I don't care for that tone...

112
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,776
- Or that reference. 
- Okay. Um, I... I...

113
00:03:22,778 --> 00:03:23,994
I got this. Sorry.

114
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,896
Sorry, she doesn't know about club culture.

115
00:03:25,898 --> 00:03:28,492
Um... I should've done this earlier,

116
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,368
it's more suave, but... let us in?

117
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,120
Thank you.

118
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:35,205
Yo, this is $500.

119
00:03:35,207 --> 00:03:36,907

120
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:38,175
Yeah, it is.

121

Look, if this had been a 20, you'd be good.

122
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,047

Sorry. It's a long story.

181
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,346
Oh! Whoa, whoa!

182
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:30,380
Whoa. Sor...

183
00:06:31,835 --> 00:06:32,802
(sighs)

184
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,384
Hey.

185
00:06:35,265 --> 00:06:36,203
Wow.

186
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:39,923
Um... so I-I texted you after the party,

187
00:06:39,925 --> 00:06:41,091
but I didn't hear back.

188
00:06:41,093 --> 00:06:42,359
Yeah, I'm sorry.

189
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:44,027
I've been really busy with
work. Seriously, though,

190
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,398
now that I have you here,

191
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:46,980
could we maybe have a postmortem

192
00:06:46,982 --> 00:06:48,315
on the whole makeout-crying session?

193
00:06:48,317 --> 00:06:50,367
I really don't think it's the time

194
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:52,102
or the place. I...

195
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:53,237
Wow.

196
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:54,321
Dude, they got Twizzlers.

197
00:06:54,323 --> 00:06:55,812
- Throwback! 
- That's great.

198
00:06:56,539 --> 00:06:58,441
Um, Rebecca,

199
00:06:58,443 --> 00:07:00,494
let me introduce you to
these two fine gentlemen.

200
00:07:00,496 --> 00:07:03,413
This is Hector, 203rd
best surfer in the state.

201
00:07:03,929 --> 00:07:05,209
- 202nd. 
- GREG: Great.

202
00:07:05,234 --> 00:07:06,250
And this is White Josh,

203
00:07:06,252 --> 00:07:07,334
so named because he looks just like Josh,

204
00:07:07,336 --> 00:07:08,451
except for he's white.

205
00:07:08,453 --> 00:07:10,837
Also, my... my name is also Josh.

206
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,139
Mmm.

207
00:07:12,601 --> 00:07:14,057
Well, we've all met.

208
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,760
Um, hopefully the next time, I'll be...

209
00:07:16,762 --> 00:07:17,811
Better looking?

210
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:19,563
- Thanks. 
- He doesn't mean that.

211
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:21,014
Uh... it's fine.

212
00:07:21,016 --> 00:07:23,066
Um, I will text you at some point,

213
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,968
I just... I-I really... I have to...

214
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,987
- Okay. 
- Yeah. I have to go.

215
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,822
Bras are in aisle one.

216
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:30,524
(guys chuckling)

217
00:07:30,526 --> 00:07:31,858
That's really nice.

218
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,143
It's, like, only $5.26.

219
00:07:33,145 --> 00:07:35,028
That's not that bad.

220
00:07:35,265 --> 00:07:36,997
Um, I think the ice cream is down here.

221
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:38,148
What are you talking about, Joshy?

222
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,199
It's right in front of you.

223
00:07:39,851 --> 00:07:41,335
Are you okay?

224
00:07:41,843 --> 00:07:44,421
Wait, why is Greg talking to a homeless?

225
00:07:45,843 --> 00:07:48,240
Oh, hi, Rebecca.

226
00:07:48,265 --> 00:07:49,793
Hey.

227
00:07:50,398 --> 00:07:51,685
You know each other?

228
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:54,715
Yeah, uh, this is my friend Rebecca.

229
00:07:54,717 --> 00:07:55,849
We, um,

230
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:58,302
met at summer camp,
like, a million, billion,

231
00:07:58,304 --> 00:08:00,771
trillion, like, a zillion years ago.

232
00:08:00,773 --> 00:08:02,105
Summer camp?

233
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,340
You guys met in summer camp?

234
00:08:03,342 --> 00:08:05,692
Yeah, we were like...
like, eight years old.

235
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:07,561
Right, Rebecca?

236
00:08:07,563 --> 00:08:08,734
No, we were...

237
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,514
We were eight and a half.

238
00:08:11,968 --> 00:08:13,066
That was very important to me

239
00:08:13,068 --> 00:08:14,901
when I was eight. I'm eight and a half!

240
00:08:14,903 --> 00:08:15,929
You know. Kids.

241
00:08:16,859 --> 00:08:18,405
Uh, this is Valencia.

242
00:08:18,407 --> 00:08:19,740
My girlfriend.

243
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:21,241
Hi.

244
00:08:21,243 --> 00:08:23,043
Nice to meet you. Oh. Hi.

245
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:28,698
My lady.

246
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,417
GREG: I'm confused.

247
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:31,835
You don't know each other from New York?

248
00:08:31,837 --> 00:08:32,869
- No. 
- Nope.

249
00:08:33,523 --> 00:08:34,671
Wait.

250
00:08:34,673 --> 00:08:36,089
How do you guys know each other?

251
00:08:36,091 --> 00:08:37,507
(laughs) Oh, we, um,

252
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:39,592
met at Home Base, um,

253
00:08:39,617 --> 00:08:42,162
and then we just became, like, cazh buds,

254
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:44,834
and, yeah, that's-that's
just, that's what happened.

255
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:46,804
Valencia, that's such a beautiful name.

256
00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:48,023
What's the origin of that?

257
00:08:48,109 --> 00:08:49,459
Well, it used to be Maria,

258
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:51,110
but I never felt like a Maria

259
00:08:51,112 --> 00:08:54,380
so I changed it to my mother's
maiden name: “Valencia”"

260
00:08:54,382 --> 00:08:56,382
It's the Spanish word for “brave”"

261
00:08:56,384 --> 00:08:57,550
That's really cool.

262
00:08:57,552 --> 00:08:58,784
Actually, I thought
about doing the same thing

263
00:08:58,786 --> 00:08:59,752
with my mother's maiden name.

264
00:08:59,754 --> 00:09:01,170
Um, it's “Garfinkel,”

265
00:09:01,172 --> 00:09:03,289
which is the Yiddish word
for “diamond dealer.”

266
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,624
Um...

267
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:06,426
God, I love that dress.

268
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:07,560
Can I just say, like,

269
00:09:07,562 --> 00:09:09,178
I cannot wear dresses like that,

270
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,432
and you pull it off so, so well.

271
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:15,468
I mean, you are... you're just so pretty.

272
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,335
I mean, you have a great body.

273
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,143
Well, I teach yoga. Keeps me fit.

274
00:09:18,168 --> 00:09:19,467
Oh, my God, I love yoga!

275
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,158
That's so funny that
we're meeting right now,

276
00:09:21,183 --> 00:09:22,266
'cause I love yoga.

277
00:09:22,601 --> 00:09:23,526
You do?

278
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:24,611
Yeah, I-I love it.

279
00:09:24,613 --> 00:09:25,662
Well, maybe you should come

280
00:09:25,664 --> 00:09:26,663
to one of my classes.

281
00:09:26,665 --> 00:09:27,830
I would love that!

282
00:09:27,832 --> 00:09:29,699
- I would love to have you!
- I would love to be had!

283
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:31,167
(whispering): Why are their voices so high?

284
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:32,335
REBECCA: Cool.

285
00:09:32,337 --> 00:09:34,504
Well, God, this has
just been the best night.

286
00:09:34,506 --> 00:09:35,838
It was so great meeting you.

287
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,959
I'm just going to gracefully exeunt,

288
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:41,664
pursued by a bear.

289
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:44,931
Uh, hey, I'll be right back.

290
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:46,382
Can you get me two more pints?

291
00:09:46,384 --> 00:09:48,000
Oh, my God, she's so pretty,
oh, my God, she's so pretty,

292
00:09:48,002 --> 00:09:50,503
oh, my God, she's so pretty,
oh, my God, she's so pretty.

293
00:09:50,505 --> 00:09:51,771
Hi.

294
00:09:51,773 --> 00:09:52,972
Hey.

295
00:09:52,974 --> 00:09:54,307
What was up with that
“eight years old” thing?

296
00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:55,841
We were 16 when we were at camp.

297
00:09:55,843 --> 00:09:57,026
No biggie. Just, uh...

298
00:09:57,028 --> 00:09:58,811
the thing with us at
camp, no one knows that,

299
00:09:58,813 --> 00:10:00,179
especially Valencia,

300
00:10:00,181 --> 00:10:01,514
so let's just keep it on the DL.

301
00:10:01,516 --> 00:10:03,683
- Is this because I look like a homeless? 
- No, just,

302
00:10:03,685 --> 00:10:05,851
Valencia, she sometimes
sweats these things.

303
00:10:05,853 --> 00:10:06,869
You get it.

304
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:08,445
Wait...

305
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,587
Is that the reason you haven't
gotten back to me about dinner?

306
00:10:11,335 --> 00:10:12,909
Come on, dude.

307
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:13,993
I'm no threat!

308
00:10:13,995 --> 00:10:14,994
Look at her!

309
00:10:14,996 --> 00:10:15,995
Look at me!

310
00:10:15,997 --> 00:10:18,030
Her! Me!

311
00:10:18,032 --> 00:10:19,365
Yoga! Homeless!

312
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:21,584
And I... I have no problem with her.

313
00:10:21,586 --> 00:10:22,868
I think she's terrific.

314
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,387
I mean, did you see how we...

315
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:25,638
we instantly bonded? Actually, I...

316
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,006
I would like to be friends with her.

317
00:10:27,008 --> 00:10:28,007
What? No.

318
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:29,175
That's not a good idea.

319
00:10:29,177 --> 00:10:31,515
I don't think you guys should be friends
or anything like that.

320
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,898
Okay, okay. No, you're right, you're right.

321
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:33,922
I am.

322
00:10:34,015 --> 00:10:35,231
Just chill, okay?

323
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,150
Okay.

324
00:10:37,152 --> 00:10:38,484
Anyway,

325
00:10:38,486 --> 00:10:40,486
- I got to roll. Catch you later. 
- Oh, okay.

326
00:10:40,488 --> 00:10:42,405
I'll catch you...

327
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:44,357
Hey, Val? I got your chin.

328
00:10:45,452 --> 00:10:46,711
I got your chin.

329
00:10:46,736 --> 00:10:48,452
What are you doing?

330
00:10:54,068 --> 00:10:55,625
_

331
00:10:58,521 --> 00:11:00,656
_

332
00:11:03,794 --> 00:11:06,045
(computer chimes)

333
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:08,317
_

334
00:11:08,342 --> 00:11:10,543
(chuckles)

335
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,748
Josh's girlfriend is so nice.

336
00:11:22,773 --> 00:11:24,495
<i>Like, so nice.</i>

337
00:11:24,497 --> 00:11:26,047
Like, stop being this nice.

338
00:11:26,049 --> 00:11:27,742
<i>You are so pretty.</i>

339
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:29,787
So, I got provisions for us

340
00:11:29,812 --> 00:11:31,446
for while we work on this arbitration,

341
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:33,007
because it is going to be...

342
00:11:33,032 --> 00:11:35,282
(laughs): a long day.

343
00:11:35,942 --> 00:11:37,141
First...

344
00:11:37,554 --> 00:11:39,443
Mama got you the strawberry donuts

345
00:11:39,445 --> 00:11:41,395
that you like from the
place around the corner.

346
00:11:41,397 --> 00:11:43,882
(squeals) And...

347
00:11:44,234 --> 00:11:46,200
look at what I found at the car wash.

348
00:11:46,202 --> 00:11:47,568
Sh-bam!

349
00:11:47,812 --> 00:11:49,742
It's a Statue of Liberty key chain.

350
00:11:50,445 --> 00:11:51,956
'Cause you're from New York.

351
00:11:52,523 --> 00:11:53,574
Do you get it?

352
00:11:54,093 --> 00:11:55,248
Do you, do you like it?

353
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:56,360
Yeah, no... (stammers)

354
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:58,045
I'm sorry, I love it, yeah!

355
00:11:58,047 --> 00:11:59,547
Oh, that's so sweet.

356
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:01,082
I don't have anything for you.

357
00:12:01,084 --> 00:12:02,466
Put it on your keys!

358
00:12:02,882 --> 00:12:04,001
Okay, yeah.

359
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:05,252
No, I mean, like, right now!

360
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:07,004
'Cause I want to, I
want to watch it happen!

361
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,609
Oh, okay.

362
00:12:10,592 --> 00:12:11,842
Ah, I'm sorry.

363
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,594
I'm sorry, I always wanted a daughter.

364
00:12:13,596 --> 00:12:16,631
I didn't, my-my kids are not daughters.

365
00:12:16,656 --> 00:12:18,038
They're terrible.

366
00:12:18,063 --> 00:12:19,712
I'll-I'll tell you about it later.

367
00:12:19,714 --> 00:12:20,539
Or now.

368
00:12:20,564 --> 00:12:21,875
So, Valencia's interests

369
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,232
include tempeh patties,

370
00:12:23,234 --> 00:12:24,906
and Vampire Weekend.

371
00:12:25,796 --> 00:12:28,007
I just feel like we have so much in common.

372
00:12:28,189 --> 00:12:29,889
What's Vampire Weekend?

373
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:32,132
Um, it's a weekend away with vampires.

374
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:34,419
(chuckles) I'm pretty sure it's not that.

375
00:12:34,444 --> 00:12:35,927
<i>No, I-I read about it in The New Yorker.</i>

376
00:12:36,064 --> 00:12:37,163
It's very popular.

377
00:12:37,165 --> 00:12:38,865
Let me see her picture.
Let me see her face.

378
00:12:38,867 --> 00:12:40,199
Here, take a look, see?

379
00:12:40,201 --> 00:12:42,335
PAULA:
Whoa-ho-ho!

380
00:12:42,337 --> 00:12:44,954
She is smoking!

381
00:12:44,956 --> 00:12:46,673
So pretty, right?

382
00:12:46,675 --> 00:12:48,507
And Josh says I can't be friends with her,

383
00:12:48,532 --> 00:12:49,718
but I really like her.

384
00:12:49,743 --> 00:12:51,910
(laughs) Come on.

385
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:55,348
You loathe her.

386
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,210
Um, no, I don't.

387
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:58,451
Oh, okay!

388
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,353
Let me tell you how this works.

389
00:13:00,355 --> 00:13:03,473
Women of equal sexual
viability hate each other.

390
00:13:03,475 --> 00:13:07,259
Even if they pretend to like each other.

391
00:13:07,261 --> 00:13:08,811
And that is how it has worked

392
00:13:08,813 --> 00:13:11,243
since the day vagina’s were invented.

393
00:13:11,483 --> 00:13:12,448
See, okay, look.

394
00:13:13,156 --> 00:13:14,484
You're like these two, all right?

395
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:16,408
You're Taylor Swift and she's Katy Perry.

396
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:18,233
Oh, wait a minute...
Maybe you're Katy Perry.

397
00:13:18,258 --> 00:13:20,225
No! No, you're Taylor Swift.

398
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,328
You're uptight and weird, right?

399
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,560
Okay, this is why I don't
read this drivel, right?

400
00:13:23,828 --> 00:13:25,945
Because it perpetuates
the very misogynist myth

401
00:13:25,947 --> 00:13:28,081
that women can't get along, right?

402
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,799
Look at this cover!

403
00:13:29,801 --> 00:13:31,584
“Femme feud, girl fight.

404
00:13:31,586 --> 00:13:32,785
Who wore it better?”

405
00:13:32,787 --> 00:13:34,179
It's like, “Who wore it equally?”

406
00:13:34,204 --> 00:13:35,117
God, you're boring.

407
00:13:35,142 --> 00:13:36,391
Look, I get what you're doing

408
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,583
with this girl and I totally approve!

409
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,574
You befriend the enemy and you
get more face time with Josh.

410
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,312
If you really neutralize her,

411
00:13:43,314 --> 00:13:45,264
maybe she'll give you some
solo time with him, so...

412
00:13:45,266 --> 00:13:46,432
No, no, mm-mm, no.

413
00:13:46,434 --> 00:13:47,567
That's not what I'm doing.

414
00:13:47,569 --> 00:13:48,684
That's not what I'm doing at all.

415
00:13:48,686 --> 00:13:50,695
I know, that is not what you're doing

416
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,720
at all... wink.

417
00:13:52,824 --> 00:13:55,274
No, I... (chuckles) I
really want to be her friend.

418
00:13:55,276 --> 00:13:56,776
Like, genuinely want to be her friend.

419
00:13:56,778 --> 00:13:58,485
- Wink. 
- Stop winking!

420
00:13:58,509 --> 00:13:59,429
(giggles)

421
00:13:59,781 --> 00:14:03,350
Ooh. Oh, she's teaching a
yoga class today at 3:00.

422
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,584
Oh, that's, like, now!

423
00:14:04,586 --> 00:14:05,618
Change of plans.

424
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,368
Eat the donut for me.

425
00:14:06,392 --> 00:14:08,598
I'm gonna go. While I'm gone,

426
00:14:08,623 --> 00:14:10,877
pull up the Mendez file,
and see what previous motions

427
00:14:10,902 --> 00:14:12,843
the plaintiff has put
before the judge, okay?

428
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:14,001
Yeah... I love this!

429
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:15,890
Gonna use it on my car right now.

430
00:14:15,915 --> 00:14:16,914
Okay...

431
00:14:17,234 --> 00:14:18,507
Go get her!

432
00:14:21,774 --> 00:14:23,000
I'll be right here.

433
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:31,289
And just breathe.

434
00:14:32,476 --> 00:14:33,929
Good.

435
00:14:33,954 --> 00:14:36,488
Everyone, thank you for joining me today

436
00:14:36,513 --> 00:14:39,062
in a journey of
self-discovery and reflection.

437
00:14:40,289 --> 00:14:42,321
Oh, you came.

438
00:14:42,323 --> 00:14:43,273
How nice.

439
00:14:43,298 --> 00:14:45,158
Everyone, we have some new faces today.

440
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:46,726
Welcome. Namaste.

441
00:14:46,758 --> 00:14:47,957
Namaste.

442
00:14:48,476 --> 00:14:49,906
Can I get an “ohm”?

443
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:50,930
(laughs)

444
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:52,732
Okay.

445
00:14:52,734 --> 00:14:55,201
So, let's start in a gentle stretch.

446
00:14:55,203 --> 00:14:57,136
Breathe in. (deep inhale)

447
00:14:57,138 --> 00:14:58,546
And out. (exhales)

448
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,749
Good, now let's move into
our first Vinyasa flow.

449
00:15:03,242 --> 00:15:04,875
And breathe in.

450
00:15:05,448 --> 00:15:07,265
And exhale on an ah...

451
00:15:08,988 --> 00:15:10,654
Ah!

452
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:12,378
ALL: Ah...

00:15:12,553 --> 00:15:15,905

Um, that was, like, amazing.

503
00:17:29,407 --> 00:17:31,540
Yeah, you are really sweating.

504
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:33,576
I think you really cleared out some toxins.

505
00:17:33,578 --> 00:17:36,746
I can see those heavy metals
just pouring out of you.

506
00:17:36,748 --> 00:17:37,840
Heavy metals, yeah.

507
00:17:38,096 --> 00:17:39,832
Well, I do eat a lot of auto parts.

508
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:40,697
Huh?

509
00:17:40,722 --> 00:17:41,791
Nothing, it's stupid.

510
00:17:41,816 --> 00:17:42,877
I'm stupid.

511
00:17:42,902 --> 00:17:45,182
Hey, do you want to go
grab, like, a coffee with me

512
00:17:45,306 --> 00:17:46,672
or something?

513
00:17:46,674 --> 00:17:48,374
I only drink water.

514
00:17:48,376 --> 00:17:49,809
And I got to go do some cardio.

515
00:17:49,811 --> 00:17:52,044
It's hard to break a sweat
doing beginner's yoga.

516
00:17:52,046 --> 00:17:54,252
Of... yeah, yeah, yeah.

517
00:17:54,277 --> 00:17:55,721
So, maybe another time.

518
00:17:55,861 --> 00:17:57,021
Well, no worries.

519
00:17:57,046 --> 00:17:58,245
'Cause I'm just gonna keep coming back.

520
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,769
Um, I bought a 20-pack on my way in,

521
00:17:59,794 --> 00:18:00,963
so I'm kind of your sugar mama

522
00:18:00,988 --> 00:18:02,137
if you know what I'm saying.

523
00:18:02,162 --> 00:18:03,713
(laughs) Yeah, I wish.

524
00:18:03,738 --> 00:18:05,416
I only get to keep 50% of each class.

525
00:18:05,441 --> 00:18:07,775
But until I own my own
studio, I can't complain.

526
00:18:07,996 --> 00:18:09,945
Well, your own studio. I mean, that's,

527
00:18:09,947 --> 00:18:11,447
that's a great idea. Have
you looked into stuff yet?

528
00:18:11,449 --> 00:18:13,082
Because I-I'm actually, I'm a lawyer

529
00:18:13,084 --> 00:18:14,750
and real estate is my specialty.

530
00:18:14,752 --> 00:18:16,369
And I could help you find a cheap place,

531
00:18:16,371 --> 00:18:17,753
get a good deal on a lease.

532
00:18:17,755 --> 00:18:18,924
Why would you want to do that?

533
00:18:19,908 --> 00:18:22,458
Well, that's why I moved here...
To support a local community.

534
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,361
And building small businesses
is an essential part of that.

535
00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:28,106
Wow, did you, like, go
to Harvard or something?

536
00:18:28,455 --> 00:18:31,217
Um, yeah, but I don't
like to talk about it,

537
00:18:31,219 --> 00:18:32,685
'cause people get weird.

538
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:34,053
Your shirt says Harvard.

539
00:18:34,744 --> 00:18:36,555
That way I don't have to talk about it.

540
00:18:36,557 --> 00:18:39,174
Hmm, wow. That's... impressive.

541
00:18:39,527 --> 00:18:41,060
Hey! Oh, mmm!

542
00:18:41,062 --> 00:18:42,445
This just popped into my nogs.

543
00:18:42,447 --> 00:18:44,146
Why don't we get lunch sometime this week,

544
00:18:44,148 --> 00:18:47,199
and I'll just, I'll go over
all the deets about leases

545
00:18:47,201 --> 00:18:49,285
and how it works.

546
00:18:49,287 --> 00:18:51,072
And I can buy you a really nice water.

547
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:52,900
Okay.

548
00:18:53,408 --> 00:18:54,518
I like boxed water.

549
00:18:55,641 --> 00:18:57,088
Great.

550
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,080
PAULA: So...

551
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:04,133
have a nice lunch with Valerio.

552
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:05,634
Who knows, maybe next time,

553
00:19:05,636 --> 00:19:07,619
you'll actually have lunch with Josh.

554
00:19:07,621 --> 00:19:09,638
Uh, okay, again, this
is not because of Josh.

555
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,891
(phone chimes)

556
00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:13,142
Who's that?

557
00:19:13,698 --> 00:19:14,924
Josh!

558
00:19:23,635 --> 00:19:24,924
JOSH: Hey!

559
00:19:24,949 --> 00:19:26,041
Hi!

560
00:19:26,066 --> 00:19:27,033
Sorry.

561
00:19:27,058 --> 00:19:28,791
Hi, um, so you wanted to see me?

562
00:19:28,816 --> 00:19:30,949
Oh, before we go talk,
do you want some boba?

563
00:19:30,974 --> 00:19:32,174
It actually horrifies me personally.

564
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:33,510
It's like drinking little tumors.

565
00:19:33,535 --> 00:19:35,354
But if you want some,
like, knock yourself out.

566
00:19:35,377 --> 00:19:36,577
No, I'm good, I'm good.

567
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:38,245
So, listen, uh, I've
been scratching my head

568
00:19:38,247 --> 00:19:40,869
a little bit here, 'cause I heard

569
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:44,218
you were having lunch with Valencia?

570
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,920
And I thought you were
gonna keep a little distance?

571
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,360
Yeah, um, the friendship thing.

572
00:19:49,385 --> 00:19:51,062
I know that we talked about that.

573
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:54,265
But it just kind of,
it happened organically.

574
00:19:54,267 --> 00:19:54,947
You know?

575
00:19:54,972 --> 00:19:56,088
I won't say a word about camp.

576
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:57,496
Oh, my God, like,

577
00:19:57,521 --> 00:19:59,637
I don't even factor that whole
thing into our friendship.

578
00:19:59,662 --> 00:20:02,096
I honestly, I barely remember it.

579
00:20:02,121 --> 00:20:04,438
I mean, I've had many
sexual partners since.

580
00:20:04,463 --> 00:20:05,646
Clean as a whistle, though.

581
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,003
I don't know.

582
00:20:07,028 --> 00:20:08,594
Uh, uh, she can get mad.

583
00:20:08,731 --> 00:20:09,877
She can, you know,

584
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:12,182
get really mad.

585
00:20:12,207 --> 00:20:13,932
But what's there to be mad about?

586
00:20:13,957 --> 00:20:16,074
Because if we're just
gonna be buds, that's all.

587
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:18,423
And the great thing is, if we're friends,

588
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,092
then we can all hang out
and it won't be awkward.

589
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,025
Right? We could have lunches

590
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,916
and dinners and go to Spiders.

591
00:20:25,248 --> 00:20:27,432
Find out if it's possessive or plural.

592
00:20:27,512 --> 00:20:28,432
(laughs) Right?

593
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,788
Thank you for letting me
order off the children's menu.

594
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,518
You're so nice.

595
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,533
This looks so good.

596
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:39,925
So I really think we're gonna

597
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,165
get the property on East Cameron.

598
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,499
You think so?

599
00:20:42,571 --> 00:20:44,054
It would be so perfect.

600
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:45,929
The square footage is exactly what I need.

601
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:47,487
But it was so expensive.

602
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:49,362
And you low-balled the guy.

603
00:20:49,387 --> 00:20:51,220
No, no. By the end of lunch,

604
00:20:51,245 --> 00:20:52,479
that guy's gonna call and cave.

605
00:20:52,504 --> 00:20:53,432
So, um,

606
00:20:53,457 --> 00:20:55,373
go back to what you were
saying about your diet,

607
00:20:55,398 --> 00:20:57,486
- 'cause it was, it was fascinating. 
- Oh, yeah.

608
00:20:57,511 --> 00:21:00,595
So, I sent my wellness
coach a drop of my blood,

609
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,037
and she told me which foods
go best with my blood type.

610
00:21:03,098 --> 00:21:05,015
So it's lots and lots of greens

611
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,361
and lean proteins and no legumes.

612
00:21:07,553 --> 00:21:09,554
<i>REBECCA: No legumes, no starches.</i>

613
00:21:09,579 --> 00:21:11,246
<i>God, she's so skinny.</i>

614
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:13,304
<i>No wonder Josh loves her.</i>

615
00:21:13,463 --> 00:21:15,146
You know, I-I sent a drop of blood

616
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,283
to a wellness coach one time,

617
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,533
and they said that my blood type
works best with Panda Express.

618
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,944
- Really? 
- No. No, it doesn't.

619
00:21:21,969 --> 00:21:23,102
Oh, you were making a joke.

620
00:21:23,127 --> 00:21:24,543
- Yeah, yeah. 
- Oh.

621
00:21:24,568 --> 00:21:26,111
Yeah, I think you did that once before.

622
00:21:26,136 --> 00:21:27,936
Sorry, I don't like humor.

623
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:29,410
Okay.

624
00:21:29,736 --> 00:21:31,746
Um, I've been meaning to ask you.

625
00:21:32,002 --> 00:21:33,698
What kind of face moisturizer do you use?

626
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,932
'Cause my face has been
dry for, like, 20 years.

627
00:21:35,957 --> 00:21:37,705
Unrefined coconut oil.

628
00:21:37,837 --> 00:21:39,197
- Really? 
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

629
00:21:39,222 --> 00:21:41,522
So, anyway, something else
my wellness coach said was...

630
00:21:41,547 --> 00:21:43,697
Actually don't do the oil
pulling for 20 minutes...

631
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:45,893
<i>REBECCA: Coconut oil.</i>

632
00:21:46,293 --> 00:21:48,744
<i>Long necklace nestled in cleavage.</i>

633
00:21:49,382 --> 00:21:51,883
<i>Silky romper... how do
you pee in that thing?</i>

634
00:21:51,885 --> 00:21:53,518
(cell phone chimes) Hold on.

635
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,111
Hold that very important thought.

636
00:21:58,307 --> 00:21:59,736
We got your yoga studio.

637
00:21:59,761 --> 00:22:00,869
We did? Yeah.

638
00:22:00,894 --> 00:22:02,643
Oh, my God, you're amazing.

639
00:22:02,668 --> 00:22:03,751
Oh. Oh, my God.

640
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,726
Hey, you're amazing.

641
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:08,080
- You smell like roasted corn. 
- Huh?

642
00:22:08,105 --> 00:22:10,155
I said you smell like roasted corn.

643
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,579
Oh, thanks.

644
00:22:11,674 --> 00:22:13,224
God, I can't believe you did it.

645
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:14,582
Well, I went to Harvard.

646
00:22:14,718 --> 00:22:16,064
I don't mess around.

647
00:22:16,089 --> 00:22:18,723
Do all people who go to Harvard
say it as much as you do?

648
00:22:18,748 --> 00:22:19,689
Yeah.

649
00:22:27,861 --> 00:22:29,971
You've checked your phone, like, 80 times.

650
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,222
Why are you so worried

651
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,674
about Valencia having lunch with Rebecca?

652
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,666
Don't know, it just... feels weird.

653
00:22:35,691 --> 00:22:37,891
Why? Did you and Rebecca
hook up or something?

654
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:40,866
(scoffing): Um, no, bro,
I was eight years old.

655
00:22:41,048 --> 00:22:42,681
Even I am not that big of a stud.

656
00:22:42,706 --> 00:22:44,666
Hmm. Wait, why?

657
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,773
Are you into Rebecca?

658
00:22:48,775 --> 00:22:49,354
Well...

659
00:22:49,379 --> 00:22:50,328
Is that why you're asking me?

660
00:22:50,472 --> 00:22:53,356
<i>Uh, I'm not... not interested.</i>

661
00:22:53,421 --> 00:22:54,420
Whoa.

662
00:22:54,445 --> 00:22:56,611
Wow, Serrano, coming from you,

663
00:22:56,636 --> 00:22:58,886
that is like... a declaration of love.

664
00:22:58,911 --> 00:22:59,910
(scoffs)

665
00:22:59,935 --> 00:23:01,584
Dude, if you want her, go for it.

666
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,025
Maybe I will. (grunts)

667
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,084
Maybe I will throw my saddle

668
00:23:07,265 --> 00:23:08,848
- on that filly. 
- Yeah.

669
00:23:08,873 --> 00:23:10,956
Take her for a ride around the paddock.

670
00:23:10,981 --> 00:23:12,097
Yeah.

671
00:23:12,122 --> 00:23:13,088
Oh, yeah, you're gonna ride that filly.

672
00:23:13,113 --> 00:23:14,666
- (neighs) 
- (neighs)

673
00:23:14,691 --> 00:23:15,830
(grunts)

674
00:23:17,627 --> 00:23:19,053
Men are disgusting.

675
00:23:19,486 --> 00:23:20,752
Yeah.

676
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,827
Hey, don't worry about
Valencia and Rebecca.

677
00:23:23,852 --> 00:23:25,552
They are not gonna become friends.

678
00:23:25,955 --> 00:23:28,213
You know how Valencia is with other women.

679
00:23:28,238 --> 00:23:29,887
Come on, she's not a bonder.

680
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,971
She can't bond.

681
00:23:30,996 --> 00:23:32,496
(both laughing)

682
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:35,096
I love you.

683
00:23:35,121 --> 00:23:37,204
No, I love you.

684
00:23:37,206 --> 00:23:38,873
(laughs)

685
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,042
(chuckles)

686
00:23:45,477 --> 00:23:47,025
Hey, what's-what's wrong?

687
00:23:49,502 --> 00:23:51,169
Uh, it's just, you
wouldn't get this about me

688
00:23:51,194 --> 00:23:52,994
because of my wide student fan base,

689
00:23:53,026 --> 00:23:56,110
but I actually don't
have a lot of girlfriends.

690
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:57,072
Huh.

691
00:23:57,097 --> 00:23:59,111
The last time I had a solid
crew was in high school,

692
00:23:59,136 --> 00:24:01,057
but then they all got jealous

693
00:24:01,082 --> 00:24:02,581
because I got these amazing boobs

694
00:24:02,606 --> 00:24:03,856
and they were still trolls,

695
00:24:03,881 --> 00:24:06,197
and so they spread all
these rumors that I, like,

696
00:24:06,255 --> 00:24:07,421
slept with the English teacher.

697
00:24:07,516 --> 00:24:08,616
No. I know.

698
00:24:08,641 --> 00:24:09,791
Which is a total lie,

699
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:11,299
because we only did hand stuff.

700
00:24:11,474 --> 00:24:12,806
And then everyone turned on me,

701
00:24:12,808 --> 00:24:14,283
and since then, I just...

702
00:24:15,091 --> 00:24:17,208
I don't get along that
well with other girls.

703
00:24:17,233 --> 00:24:18,849
Oh, my God, I'm the exact same way.

704
00:24:19,307 --> 00:24:20,775
Yeah? I mean, except for
the English teacher part.

705
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,518
- That's-that's really cool. 
- Thanks.

706
00:24:22,992 --> 00:24:25,025
Although, um, it-it's really cool,

707
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:27,050
but, like, you know, you
should have reported that.

708
00:24:27,075 --> 00:24:28,875
Did you report it to the
appropriate authorities?

709
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,474
Nah, it's just hand
stuff... It's not a big deal.

710
00:24:31,499 --> 00:24:34,834
Well, I mean, depending
on what age you were,

711
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:37,309
it's technically a little
bit of statutory rape.

712
00:24:37,334 --> 00:24:38,683
Eh... But, you know.

713
00:24:38,736 --> 00:24:40,834
I'll allow it.

714
00:24:40,836 --> 00:24:42,520
But seriously, a judge
would not have allowed it.

715
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:43,521
He should be in jail.

716
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:44,635
Do you know if he went to jail?

717
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,588
Did he do it to other kids?

718
00:24:45,613 --> 00:24:48,369
Oh, my God, you're amazing, you're so nice.

719
00:24:49,018 --> 00:24:51,445
I thought you just only wanted
to do real estate stuff with me,

720
00:24:52,268 --> 00:24:53,494
but we're friends.

721

Yeah, we're friends.

725
00:25:00,873 --> 00:25:02,400
Yeah, 'cause, I mean, like,

728

(laughing): I know!

730
00:25:09,918 --> 00:25:11,250
Aah! Yeah.

Valencia and I are
basically the same person.

737

I don't know what she is... Guatemalan?

I don't know, don't quote me on that.

739
00:25:34,394 --> 00:25:37,428

742
00:25:44,144 --> 00:25:47,146

it, that was me vomiting.

No, I got it.

744

745
00:25:50,985 --> 00:25:53,620
'Cause, like, I've made
a really cool friend.

746
00:25:53,622 --> 00:25:55,538
She's, like, pretty and nice,

747
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,540
and she knows about,
like, a lot of cool things,

748
00:25:57,542 --> 00:26:00,627
like coconut oil and
movies and Vampire Weekends.

749
00:26:00,629 --> 00:26:01,994
Like, what's your deal?

750
00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:05,548
We had a plan... uh, neutralize
the enemy, not snuggle it.

751
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,850
No, we didn't have a plan.

752
00:26:06,852 --> 00:26:09,102
You had a plan, I'm making a friend.

753
00:26:09,104 --> 00:26:10,386
- What?! 
- Wow.

754
00:26:10,388 --> 00:26:11,521

755
00:26:11,523 --> 00:26:14,190

Oh, you know, I have
never met anyone in my life

762
00:26:26,905 --> 00:26:28,538
who lies to themselves as much as you do.

763
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,873
You lie about why you came here,

764
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:31,241
You lie about how you feel about Josh.

765
00:26:31,243 --> 00:26:33,693
You lie about why you want to
become friends with Valencia.

766
00:26:33,695 --> 00:26:35,995
Okay, okay, that's enough! God!

767

768

00:26:39,733 --> 00:26:41,385
Hello, gentlemen.

770
00:26:42,966 --> 00:26:45,818
So we heard most of that.

771
00:26:45,891 --> 00:26:48,725

I see the horrified looks

Paula and I were just having a
little disagreement out there.

775
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:54,380
It has nothing to do with you.

776
00:26:54,382 --> 00:26:56,099
It will not happen again.

777
00:26:56,101 --> 00:26:57,383
Let's get down to business,

779
00:26:58,191 --> 00:26:59,799
You know that was very
inappropriate what we overheard.

780

I didn't mention that.

788
00:27:14,235 --> 00:27:15,705
Should have led with that. Sorry.

00:27:17,405 --> 00:27:19,255
Uh, we've been trying to do that for years.

791
00:27:19,257 --> 00:27:21,624
Actually, I threatened
a lawsuit on the grounds

792
00:27:21,626 --> 00:27:23,242
that they were impeding
commercial development,

793
00:27:23,244 --> 00:27:25,578

for interest or extra costs.

Wait, wait.

923
00:33:33,774 --> 00:33:35,008
Oh!

924
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,142
Are you crazy?!

925
00:33:36,144 --> 00:33:37,394
What is wrong with you?!

926
00:33:37,396 --> 00:33:38,728
We were just being cute!

927
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:39,779
Cute kissing.

928
00:33:39,781 --> 00:33:41,031
For attention.

929
00:33:41,033 --> 00:33:43,349
(groans) Are you stupid, Harvard?

930
00:33:43,351 --> 00:33:45,385
Oh, this is why I can't
be friends with women!

931
00:33:45,387 --> 00:33:47,687
Why does everyone want
to have sex with me?!

932
00:33:47,689 --> 00:33:49,689
Okay, so, Valencia, Valencia?

933
00:33:49,691 --> 00:33:51,207
It's all good, okay?

934
00:33:51,209 --> 00:33:53,376
It's just, it's just
there's so much love here.

935
00:33:53,378 --> 00:33:54,577
Just back off, okay?

936
00:33:54,579 --> 00:33:55,996
I-I think we should call it a night.

937
00:33:55,998 --> 00:33:57,564
- You think? 
- Hey, shh, come on.

938
00:33:57,566 --> 00:33:58,999
No, I-I just want to apologize!
I want to talk to you...

939
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:01,034
The reason why, the reason
with her... Valencia?

940
00:34:01,036 --> 00:34:02,453
See, okay, it all makes sense,

941
00:34:02,478 --> 00:34:04,139
because it's a circle of love.

942
00:34:04,164 --> 00:34:05,576
Because I love you.

943
00:34:05,601 --> 00:34:06,716
You love Josh.

944
00:34:06,741 --> 00:34:08,958
And Josh and I used to love each other.

945
00:34:09,084 --> 00:34:11,251
(groans)

946
00:34:15,742 --> 00:34:17,843
What is this drunk bitch talking about?

947
00:34:17,845 --> 00:34:19,428
REBECCA: Um...

948
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,463
so I'd like to start by saying

949
00:34:21,465 --> 00:34:22,734
that it was nothing.

950
00:34:22,759 --> 00:34:25,718
What... is... she...

951
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,687
talking about?!

952
00:34:28,712 --> 00:34:29,968
Um...

953
00:34:30,691 --> 00:34:31,625
um...

954
00:34:32,426 --> 00:34:35,895
Do you remember that summer
between 11th and 12th grade

955
00:34:35,897 --> 00:34:38,242
when, uh, I went to camp...

956
00:34:38,267 --> 00:34:40,289
and we were technically on a break?

957
00:34:40,314 --> 00:34:42,937
It was, it was eons ago!
Right? It was eons ago!

958
00:34:42,962 --> 00:34:44,039
It meant nothing!

959
00:34:44,064 --> 00:34:45,880
It was just two young bucks

960
00:34:45,905 --> 00:34:48,539
sharing two months of summer love.

961
00:34:48,592 --> 00:34:50,142
It was a moment of connection.

962
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:53,070
And isn't that what yoga's all about?

963
00:34:54,945 --> 00:34:56,898
Why did you lie to me?

964
00:34:56,923 --> 00:34:58,172
B-Because he...

965
00:35:00,226 --> 00:35:02,137
I-I was afraid. I was afraid.

966
00:35:02,139 --> 00:35:03,672
I was afraid, okay?!

967
00:35:03,674 --> 00:35:04,836
I was afraid.

968
00:35:04,861 --> 00:35:06,310
I don't know what you're trying to do

969
00:35:06,335 --> 00:35:09,286
or why you pretended to be my friend,

970
00:35:09,311 --> 00:35:11,133
but stay away from me

971
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,250
and my Josh.

972
00:35:22,376 --> 00:35:23,562
Are you okay?

973
00:35:25,803 --> 00:35:26,945
No.

974
00:35:27,384 --> 00:35:29,300
Let me go out on a limb and say

975
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,237
telling the truth from the beginning

976
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:32,867
probably would've been
the better option here?

977
00:35:32,892 --> 00:35:33,828
You're right.

978
00:35:35,531 --> 00:35:36,697
(chuckles)

979
00:35:36,722 --> 00:35:38,039
I messed everything up.

980
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,161
Thank you for pointing it out.

981
00:35:43,163 --> 00:35:44,820
Is this what you wanted?

982
00:35:44,845 --> 00:35:45,836
You're right.

983
00:35:48,117 --> 00:35:49,518
I'm hungry.

984
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,133
You want to go to a diner?

985
00:35:51,174 --> 00:35:52,840
Maybe get a cup of coffee?

986
00:35:52,865 --> 00:35:55,133
You could use a cup of
coffee, some flapjacks.

987
00:35:55,158 --> 00:35:55,992
Just... I...

988
00:35:56,348 --> 00:35:58,031
Stop being nice to me, okay?

989
00:35:59,755 --> 00:36:02,423
Great to see you, Mr. Spiders!

990
00:36:02,925 --> 00:36:04,789
Well, at least that's been cleared up.

991
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:11,135
(humming “We Wish You
a Merry Christmas”)

992
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:15,740
It's not Christmas!

993
00:36:16,586 --> 00:36:17,811
Well, I just like the song.

994
00:36:18,203 --> 00:36:19,062
Where's Rebecca?

995
00:36:19,064 --> 00:36:21,531
I usually see you two at
break enjoying your Luna Bars.

996
00:36:21,533 --> 00:36:23,066
Who cares? I don't care about her.

997
00:36:23,068 --> 00:36:24,801
She talks too much.

998
00:36:24,803 --> 00:36:26,186
Well, I don't know about that.

999
00:36:26,188 --> 00:36:27,487
But she does always
eat the Lemon Zest bars,

1000
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:30,106
before I can get my mitts on them, mmm.

1001
00:36:30,108 --> 00:36:32,500
You know Luna Bars are for women, right?

1002
00:36:34,008 --> 00:36:35,996
Oh, I did not.

1003
00:36:35,998 --> 00:36:39,812
Yeah, I think they have,
like, menstrual blood in them.

1004
00:36:40,297 --> 00:36:41,172
Stop that.

1005
00:36:41,197 --> 00:36:43,531
No, they don't.

1006
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,343
Oof!

1007
00:36:46,781 --> 00:36:48,652
It's a long story.

1008
00:36:48,976 --> 00:36:52,012
Can I get the number for
Luna Bars customer service?

1009
00:36:52,256 --> 00:36:53,875
I feel like I've lost her.

1010
00:36:55,367 --> 00:36:56,773
I know I still have you.

1011
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:59,195
But you have your rugby friends now.

1012
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,359
What should I do?

1013
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,203
Hey.

1014
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:13,437
Hey.

1015
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:17,037
Oh!

1016
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:19,387
Munchkin.

1017
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,659
God, I am so sorry.

1018
00:37:22,981 --> 00:37:25,442
I'm such a bad friend.

1019
00:37:26,606 --> 00:37:28,665
You're the only person that I can trust.

1020
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:30,717
You know why? You're a true friend.

1021
00:37:31,598 --> 00:37:33,336
Because a true friend
is somebody who loves you

1022
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:34,708
no matter what.

1023
00:37:35,192 --> 00:37:37,390
Even if your Downward Dog is horrible.

1024
00:37:37,392 --> 00:37:40,059
(laughing): Oh, come here.

1025
00:37:40,084 --> 00:37:41,633
Oh, you guys.

1026
00:37:41,665 --> 00:37:44,450
Ow, not you, Darryl! Get off!

1027
00:37:45,348 --> 00:37:47,622
You know, that's not true about Luna Bars.

1028
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,397
Talked to the customer service.

1029
00:37:49,422 --> 00:37:50,879
They were very nice.

1030
00:37:57,171 --> 00:38:00,816
So, my client, Mr. Mendez,
will drop his counter-suit

1031
00:38:00,841 --> 00:38:04,011
and will reimburse Mr. Robertson
for all of his relocation fees

1032
00:38:04,036 --> 00:38:06,536
for the entire duration of construction.

1033
00:38:06,919 --> 00:38:09,372
Also, he will provide a free lease

1034
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:10,674
on a floor-through space

1035
00:38:10,676 --> 00:38:12,356
for a period of 18 months.

1036
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:15,512
Hmm, Ms. Bunch,

1037
00:38:15,514 --> 00:38:18,262
your arguments are...

1038
00:38:18,776 --> 00:38:20,177
persuasive.

1039
00:38:22,419 --> 00:38:24,020
I rule in your favor, Mr. Mendez.

1040
00:38:24,022 --> 00:38:25,555
You are free to build on that lot,

1041
00:38:25,557 --> 00:38:28,108
pending the usual
approvals and inspections.

1042
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,526
(laughing)

1043
00:38:29,528 --> 00:38:31,036
Thank you.

1044
00:38:31,262 --> 00:38:32,862
Ah!

1045
00:38:32,864 --> 00:38:35,932
I have been trying to settle
this case for ten years.

1046
00:38:35,934 --> 00:38:37,867
Uh, yeah, I think you
mentioned that once or twice.

1047
00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:40,770
This is what she did for you her
first week of working for you.

1048
00:38:40,772 --> 00:38:42,706
Imagine what she's gonna do next week.

1049
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:44,407
Yes! Yes!

1050
00:38:44,409 --> 00:38:45,825
- Yes! 
- Let's go.

1051
00:38:45,827 --> 00:38:47,711
- Go drink, gentlemen. 
- Yes! Ha-ha!

1052
00:38:47,713 --> 00:38:48,828
Thank you, thank you.

1053
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:51,047
You're welcome.

1054
00:38:51,049 --> 00:38:52,332
(both shriek)

1055
00:38:52,334 --> 00:38:54,551
Oh, my God!

1056
00:38:54,553 --> 00:38:56,386
- Well done! 
- Bang! Bang! Bang!

1057
00:38:56,388 --> 00:38:57,504
Oh! Oh, guess what.

1058
00:38:57,506 --> 00:38:59,222
What? I got something for you.

1059
00:38:59,224 --> 00:39:00,456
Oh, Paula, another present?

1060
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:01,624
Come on, you don't have to do that.

1061
00:39:01,626 --> 00:39:03,843
(stammers) Don't move.

1062
00:39:06,432 --> 00:39:09,568
I got these...

1063
00:39:09,934 --> 00:39:11,768
(both laughing)

1064
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:14,404
for your feud with Valencia.

1065
00:39:14,406 --> 00:39:16,683
So, you know,

1066
00:39:17,067 --> 00:39:19,326
if it ever becomes a feud again,

1067
00:39:19,794 --> 00:39:23,113
we'll have these handy.

1068
00:39:23,115 --> 00:39:24,447
(laughs)

1069
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:26,616
Paula, that's really sweet.

1070
00:39:26,618 --> 00:39:27,867
Thank you.

1071
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:30,319
I just want you to know
that if you ever need it,

1072
00:39:30,321 --> 00:39:34,528
this... T-shirt will
always be there for you.

1073
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:37,160
I know, thank you.

1074
00:39:37,162 --> 00:39:38,345
Okay.

1075
00:39:38,347 --> 00:39:39,596
And I'm here.

1076
00:39:39,598 --> 00:39:41,548
The-the
T-shirt is me.

1077
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,666
- Which you got that. 
- Yeah, I get it.

1078
00:39:43,668 --> 00:39:44,884
I don't know why

1079
00:39:44,886 --> 00:39:47,192
I felt the need to explain that to...

1080
00:39:51,225 --> 00:39:52,842
Hi, excuse me.

1081
00:39:52,844 --> 00:39:54,844
Um, I'm here to see Rebecca Bunch.

1082
00:39:54,846 --> 00:39:56,312
Is she here?

1083
00:40:01,958 --> 00:40:02,986
Hi.

1084
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,404
Hi, do you have a second?

1085
00:40:05,581 --> 00:40:07,661
Uh, yeah, I have a second.

1086
00:40:07,686 --> 00:40:09,161
I have two seconds.

1087
00:40:09,186 --> 00:40:11,973
How many... (laughs) seconds do you need?

1088
00:40:11,998 --> 00:40:13,036
Let's take all the seconds.

1089
00:40:13,061 --> 00:40:14,311
Okay. Let's go...

1090
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,451
This is my good luck room!

1091
00:40:15,653 --> 00:40:16,856
Let's go in my good luck room.

1092
00:40:17,034 --> 00:40:18,755
You know why it's my good luck room?

1093
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,294
I just actually won,
like, a big case in here.

1094
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:23,645
Like, literally seconds
ago, I won a huge case. Wow.

1095
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,864
Yeah. This place is sweet!

1096
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:26,051
Yeah, yeah, it's...

1097
00:40:26,076 --> 00:40:27,512
Why are you here? Why are... ?

1098
00:40:27,537 --> 00:40:29,671
Not, like, why are you
here? Why are you here?

1099
00:40:29,898 --> 00:40:31,364
Uh, I've been thinking about it a lot,

1100
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:33,145
and I realize...

1101
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:36,247
I shouldn't have asked you to lie.

1102
00:40:36,272 --> 00:40:39,190
The-the crazy stuff that
happened last night, it was

1103
00:40:39,215 --> 00:40:41,582
all my fault in a way,
because of the lying.

1104
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:44,775
No, no. Some of it was my fault, too.

1105
00:40:45,386 --> 00:40:48,637
I mean, sticking my tongue
down your girlfriend's throat

1106
00:40:49,014 --> 00:40:50,247
kind of crossed a line.

1107
00:40:50,272 --> 00:40:51,067
Right?

1108
00:40:51,363 --> 00:40:53,176
Well, anyway, uh, I'd
like to make it up to you.

1109
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:56,820
So I was thinking you want
to grab that dinner tonight?

1110
00:40:58,755 --> 00:41:00,145
Um...

1111
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:01,294
yeah.

1112
00:41:01,801 --> 00:41:03,309
That sounds great.

1113
00:41:09,979 --> 00:41:12,647
- Mmm, mmm! 
- So good.

1114
00:41:12,672 --> 00:41:14,055
- Right? 
- Mmm!

1115
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,613
- This place is awesome. 
- I know.

1116
00:41:15,638 --> 00:41:17,021
Do you come here a lot?

1117
00:41:17,046 --> 00:41:18,712
Well, nah, it's a little far.

1118
00:41:18,737 --> 00:41:21,771
I was gonna say I drove,
like, 45 minutes to get here.

1119
00:41:21,796 --> 00:41:23,179
Yeah.

1120
00:41:23,756 --> 00:41:26,270
Does Valencia know we're
hanging out tonight?

1121
00:41:26,295 --> 00:41:27,973
Uh, no, she says she doesn't want me

1122
00:41:27,998 --> 00:41:29,331
to see you ever again.

1123
00:41:29,356 --> 00:41:30,880
So this is probably the last time

1124
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,571
we can have dinner.

1125
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:35,157
(laughs) Well, we'll see about that.

1126
00:41:35,182 --> 00:41:36,399
(laughing): Yeah.

1127
00:41:36,987 --> 00:41:39,203
We'll see about that.

1128
00:41:44,926 --> 00:41:46,544
Welcome, everyone,

1129
00:41:46,569 --> 00:41:48,294
to Vampire Weekend.

1130
00:41:48,754 --> 00:41:50,551
For those of you who would
like to go water-skiing,

1131
00:41:50,576 --> 00:41:51,864
there will be a tutorial

1132
00:41:51,889 --> 00:41:53,833
at 2:00... a.m.

1133
00:41:56,021 --> 00:41:56,886
You see?

1134
00:41:56,911 --> 00:41:59,831
