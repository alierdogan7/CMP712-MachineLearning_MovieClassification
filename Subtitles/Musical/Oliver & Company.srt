I mean, what happens?
- Shut up, you little rodent.

Hey, man, this stuff
is boring, man.

200
00:13:17,527 --> 00:13:20,166
Come on, let's watch some boxing.
I wanna see some action.

201
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:24,001
[Laughing] Hey, Frankie.?? Que paso?
You're getting slow, man.

202
00:13:24,087 --> 00:13:27,443
- [Laughs]
- My name is Francis.

203
00:13:27,527 --> 00:13:30,724
Fran-cis.
Not Frank.

204
00:13:30,807 --> 00:13:33,765
Not Frankie.
Francis.

205
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:38,079
No kidding, man? Hey, so what did you
bring in today, "Frahn-cees"?

206
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:41,125
It's none of your business,
you intrusive little pipsqueak.

207
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:43,198
Look what I got.

208
00:13:43,287 --> 00:13:48,486
Oh, good show, Einstein. Now all
we need is the court and the net.

209
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:50,717
You think this place
is big enough?

210
00:13:50,807 --> 00:13:54,720
Hey, come on. What we need is some
good quality stuff, man.

211
00:13:54,807 --> 00:13:57,446
- Check it out.
- Oh, shredded leather.

212
00:13:57,527 --> 00:14:01,645
Shredded wha... What you talkin'about,
man? That's a primo wallet, man.

213
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,558
- Rubbish, you mean.
- All right, that does it, Frankie, man!

214
00:14:03,647 --> 00:14:06,241
You insulted my pride!
That means death!

215
00:14:06,327 --> 00:14:09,125
- [Francis]
Behold. The runt of the litter.
- Cut it out, you two.

216
00:14:09,207 --> 00:14:11,926
- Frankie! Frankie!
- Atf!

217
00:14:12,007 --> 00:14:16,364
Fagin's not gonna be too happy about
this. Francis, you got the food, right?

218
00:14:16,447 --> 00:14:19,200
- Well, no. I...
- Ooh, Frankie.

219
00:14:19,287 --> 00:14:21,562
- Frankie. It was your turn
to get the food today.
- Frankie.

220
00:14:21,647 --> 00:14:24,320
- It's newspaper burritos again!
- [Dodger] Hey.

221
00:14:24,407 --> 00:14:27,319
Whoa. Whoa.
Cool it, Dodger fans.

222
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:31,002
I'd like to introduce you to...
your dinner.

223
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:33,555
- Hot dogs a la Dodger.
- Hot dogs! All right, Dodger man!

224
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:36,442
[Francis]
You remain our preeminent benefactor.

225
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:39,121
[Einstein]
Yeah. And you're okay too.

226
00:14:39,207 --> 00:14:41,482
[Female Dog] So how'd you do it
this time, Dodgie baby?

227
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:45,560
Let me tell you, Rita. It was tough.
Only I could have done it.

228
00:14:45,647 --> 00:14:48,639
Did you have to fight, man?
Did you fight? How many were there?

229
00:14:48,727 --> 00:14:50,604
Picture the city.

230
00:14:50,687 --> 00:14:53,918
Eighth and Broadway.
The crowds hustling.

231
00:14:54,007 --> 00:14:57,124
The traffic roaring.
The hot dogs are sizzling.

232
00:14:57,207 --> 00:14:59,721
I love a story with food in it.

233
00:14:59,807 --> 00:15:03,038
Enter Dodger,
one bad puppy.

234
00:15:03,127 --> 00:15:06,085
Not just out for himself,
but community minded.

235
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:08,317
But he's not
the only one out there.

236
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,240
- Enter the opposition.
- [Sighs]

237
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,842
- A greedy, ugly, psychotic monster...
- [Gulps]

238
00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:18,476
With razor-sharp claws,
dripping fangs,

239
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:21,559
and nine lives,
all of them hungry.

240
00:15:21,647 --> 00:15:25,083
He comes at me, eyes burning.
I knew my time had come.

241
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:26,839
- Suddenly...
- [Screeches]

242
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:29,122
Gang war! Gang war!

243
00:15:29,207 --> 00:15:32,802
- Watch out! Here comes a gang war!
- [Francis] Take cover.

244
00:15:32,887 --> 00:15:34,878
[Grunting]

245
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,798
Well, what is it?

246
00:15:38,327 --> 00:15:40,795
Hey, man, check it out.

247
00:15:40,887 --> 00:15:43,196
[Sniffing]
Aye, it's a alien!

248
00:15:45,047 --> 00:15:46,878
Cool it, guys.
It's just a cat.

249
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:50,084
- !? Mi madre, un gato!
- Feles domesticus!

250
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:52,635
Now, how'd you
find this place, cat?

251
00:15:52,727 --> 00:15:55,560
I... I... I followed
this dog.

252
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,877
- He's lying! He's lying!
He's lying! He's lying!
- Shut up, Tito!

253
00:15:57,967 --> 00:16:00,800
- Why would a cat follow a dog?
- Yeah?

254
00:16:00,887 --> 00:16:04,323
I-I just wanted some of the sausage
I helped him get.

255
00:16:04,407 --> 00:16:08,036
He's a spy, man! Come on,
let's eat him. You're dead meat, kitty.

256
00:16:08,127 --> 00:16:10,925
I-I saw him come down.

257
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,123
Hey! That's... Hey,
that's him! O-Over there.

258
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:16,517
- Hmm?
- Hey, kitty. What took you so long?

259
00:16:16,607 --> 00:16:20,486
- [Rita] Relax, kid.
- [Dogs Laughing]

260
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:22,922
Dodger,
razor-sharp claws?

261
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:26,886
- Dripping fangs?
- I kind of like those burning eyes.

262
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:29,800
Hey, keep it down, guys.
The game's on.

263
00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:33,516
Oh, boy, Dodger. Top dog has
to get help from a cat. [Giggling]

264
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:35,757
Hey, Tito, cool it, man.

265
00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:39,396
- Come on. Let's see this big,
bad kitty fight in action.
- Hey, Tito, look!

266
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:41,921
[Shouts]

267
00:16:42,007 --> 00:16:44,680

268

- Oh, what a bunch of overgrown... Oof!

269
00:16:49,527 --> 00:16:53,315

What's the matter with you guys?

272
00:17:00,607 --> 00:17:02,518
Don't you understand?

273
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:04,677
Sykes will be here any minute.
[Whimpers] And I don't have...

274
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,759
- No, no, no, no, no!
- [Barking]

275
00:17:07,847 --> 00:17:11,442
[Laughing]
No, no. Stop it.

276
00:17:11,527 --> 00:17:13,995
No. No.
No licking.

00:17:14,087 --> 00:17:17,443

278
00:17:17,527 --> 00:17:20,200

- Sykes!

280
00:17:24,287 --> 00:17:26,847
All right, all right.
I'm coming.

281
00:17:26,927 --> 00:17:28,997
[Whimpering]
I'll be right there.

282
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,078
You guys, listen.
Don't let me down.

283
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:33,886
What do you got?
Let's see what you got.

284
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:37,516
[Gasps]
It's worthless! What have you done?

285
00:17:37,607 --> 00:17:42,362
Oh, how are we ever going
to pay Sykes off with a... a pussycat?

286
00:17:42,447 --> 00:17:44,563
- [Pounding]
- [Ferocious Growling]

Look who's here, kids.

288
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:51,836
Company.
Nice doggies.

289
00:17:51,927 --> 00:17:54,760

Mr Sykes. I, uh...
[Stammering]

293
00:18:14,687 --> 00:18:16,803
He's gonna kill me.

294
00:18:22,007 --> 00:18:25,761
[Chuckles]
Hello. Oh, lovely evening.

295
00:18:25,847 --> 00:18:28,725
I was just saying this
to your two lovely,

296
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,763
- purebred Dobermans.
- The money, Fagin.

297
00:18:30,847 --> 00:18:33,486
Actually, I've got something
much better than money.

298
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:38,402
Some luxury items that should make
a considerable dent in my debt to you.

299
00:18:38,487 --> 00:18:41,923
Oh, my!
You waxed your car, didn't you?

300
00:18:42,007 --> 00:18:45,363
Did they use the buffer on it,
because I can see myself.

301
00:18:45,447 --> 00:18:48,200
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

302
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:53,244
I don't want
your garbage, Fagin!

303
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:55,602
Oh, please, Sykes.
Oh, please. Oh, please.

304
00:18:55,687 --> 00:18:58,565
I don't think you grasp...

305
00:18:58,647 --> 00:19:00,842
the severity
of the situation.

306
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,726
Oh, no!
Oh, no, I did grasp it.

307
00:19:04,807 --> 00:19:07,879
This is how I grasp. Look.
[Screams, Stammering]

308
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:09,798
Accident.

309
00:19:09,887 --> 00:19:12,196
Accident!
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

310
00:19:12,287 --> 00:19:15,085
- Mr Fagin!
- Sorry.

311
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:19,206
Now, I lent you money
and I don't see it.

312
00:19:19,287 --> 00:19:23,565
Do you know what happens when
I don't see my money, Fagin?

313
00:19:23,647 --> 00:19:25,603
- [Wheezing]
- People get hurt.

314
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,955
- People like you get hurt.
- [Gasps]

315
00:19:32,607 --> 00:19:35,405
- Do I make myself clear?
- [Coughs]

316
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:37,318
[Squeaking]
Clear! Perfectly clear!

317
00:19:37,407 --> 00:19:40,444
Ya know, Rita,
I can't figure out...

318
00:19:40,527 --> 00:19:42,757
why you'd rather hang around
a dump like this...

319
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:46,681
when you could be living uptown
with a class act like myself.

320
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:51,887
Isn't it rather dangerous to use one's
entire vocabulary in a single sentence?

321
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:55,403
[Laughing] Hey, Frankie, get down,
brother. You bad, man.

322
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:58,763
- Hey, you got something
to say to me, fat boy?
- [Stammering]

323
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:01,315
Come on, you guys don't scare me.
I'll kill you both.

324
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,205
- Come on, let me at 'em! [Growling]
- [Doberman Chuckles]

325
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:06,482
Go ahead. Let him go.

326
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:09,559
Why don't you pick
on someone your own size?

327
00:20:09,647 --> 00:20:12,036
- Like you, old man?
- [Dodger] Hey, Roscoe.

328
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:15,881
Roscoe, is this us
losing our sense of humour?

329
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:19,721
Nah. I ain't lost
my sense of humour.

330
00:20:19,807 --> 00:20:21,957
[Crash]

331
00:20:22,047 --> 00:20:26,438
See? I find that funny.
[Chuckles]

332
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:28,563
Oh, please.
[Crying]

333
00:20:28,647 --> 00:20:31,241
Please.
Oh, please!

334
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:36,600
Three sunrises.
Three sunsets.

335
00:20:36,687 --> 00:20:38,803
Three days, Fagin.

336
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:42,118
Three sunrises.
Three sunsets.

337
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,675
Three days.
Three, three, three. That's nine.

338
00:20:44,767 --> 00:20:47,440
- Nine?
- No, Fagin.

339
00:20:47,527 --> 00:20:49,438
- Three.
- Three!

340
00:20:49,527 --> 00:20:51,518
Oh, you mean,
just three days?

341
00:20:51,607 --> 00:20:55,725
Oh, my goodness!
[Sobbing]

342
00:20:55,807 --> 00:20:57,957
Oh, I'm having a bad day!

[Water Splashing]

345
00:21:02,487 --> 00:21:06,560
Hey, hey, Roscoe.
Look what I found.

346
00:21:06,647 --> 00:21:09,286
Forget it, DeSoto.
We gotta go.

347
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:12,518
I like cats.
I like to eat 'em.

348
00:21:12,607 --> 00:21:15,246
[Yelping, Growls]

349
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:20,365
[Both Growling]

350
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:22,915
Get out of my way,
Dodger.

351
00:21:23,007 --> 00:21:24,998
That's enough, Roscoe.

352
00:21:27,847 --> 00:21:31,886
- [Horn Honking]
- [Rita] Run along, Roscoe.

353
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:35,084
Your master's calling.

354
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:38,477
- [Growling]
- [Honking]

355
00:21:38,567 --> 00:21:41,798
Come on, DeSoto.

356
00:21:41,887 --> 00:21:45,163
We ain't finished, Dodger.
You guys are gonna pay for this,

357
00:21:45,247 --> 00:21:48,045
starting with that cat.

358
00:21:48,127 --> 00:21:51,836
Oh, yeah? You guys don't scare me!
Come on and say it to my face!

359
00:21:51,927 --> 00:21:54,760
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on!

360
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:58,396
Yeah, those creeps'll think twice
before hassling us, man. [Chuckles]

361
00:21:58,487 --> 00:22:01,206
All right, kid.
What'd I tell you guys?

362
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:04,085
OI' Dodge can
really pick 'em, huh?

363
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:05,998
[Door Closing]

364
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:10,403
Ooh, three days.

365
00:22:10,487 --> 00:22:12,523
[Whimpering]

366
00:22:12,607 --> 00:22:14,438
[Sighs]

367
00:22:20,527 --> 00:22:23,644
How am I ever gonna come up
with all that money? [Crying]

368
00:22:29,007 --> 00:22:33,125
What's the use? I'll never get out
from under that maniac.

369
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:40,043
[Sighs]
My days are numbered...

370
00:22:40,127 --> 00:22:42,436
and the number is three.

371
00:22:43,527 --> 00:22:45,677
It's hopeless.

372
00:23:00,287 --> 00:23:02,118
Thanks, guys.

373
00:23:03,487 --> 00:23:07,765
[Laughing]
That reminds me.

374
00:23:07,847 --> 00:23:11,920
I saw DeSoto's nose.
Who did that?

375
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:16,522
You? You.

376
00:23:16,607 --> 00:23:20,680
[Laughing]
That took a lot of guts.

377
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:24,043
- [Purring]
- We've never had a cat
in the gang before.

378
00:23:24,127 --> 00:23:26,800
We can use all the help
we can get.

379
00:23:26,887 --> 00:23:29,321
[Groaning]

380
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:32,524
- [Cracking Neck]
- Ahhh. All right.

381
00:23:32,607 --> 00:23:35,804
Time for bed.
We've got a big day tomorrow.

382
00:23:38,127 --> 00:23:41,164
- [Whining]
- Aww, no.

383
00:23:41,247 --> 00:23:44,683
[Chuckles]
Oh, all right.

384
00:23:44,767 --> 00:23:46,723
But just one chapter
tonight.

385
00:23:46,807 --> 00:23:50,243
Umm, let's see.
[Muttering]

386
00:23:54,047 --> 00:23:58,563
Here we are. Here we are.
Chapter seven. [Clears Throat]

387
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:04,005
"Sparky stopped and he rolled in
a field of wildflowers.

388
00:24:04,087 --> 00:24:06,396
The dandelions tickled
his nose...

389
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:10,036
- 'til he laughed out loud.
- [Heavy Panting]

390
00:24:10,127 --> 00:24:12,687
And then
something caught his eye.

391
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:16,637
It was Bumper the rabbit.

392
00:24:16,727 --> 00:24:18,558
Sparky jumped to his feet...

393
00:24:18,647 --> 00:24:21,923
and ran toward Bumper
barking loudly. "

394
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:24,999
[Weakly]
Woof. Woof.

395
00:24:25,087 --> 00:24:27,043
Well, you try it
sometime.

396
00:24:27,127 --> 00:24:30,915
[Clears Throat]
Ruff! R-Ruff!

397
00:24:31,007 --> 00:24:33,077
Well, that's because
you're a dog.

398
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:37,001
"Sparky knew that Bumper would run and
that he could chase him over the field.

399
00:24:37,087 --> 00:24:39,999
But Sparky would never catch him
or hurt him...

400
00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:42,362
because Sparky
was not that kind of a dog."

401
00:24:43,687 --> 00:24:45,837
[Snoring]

402
00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:32,481

[Horn Weakly Honking]

404
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,637
This is the big one.

405
00:26:13,727 --> 00:26:16,480
- We've got two days to do or die.
- [Honking]

406
00:26:16,567 --> 00:26:19,843
Dodger, you keep an eye
on the new kid. Show him the ropes.

407
00:26:19,927 --> 00:26:24,205
I don't wanna put any
undue pressure on you, but...

408
00:26:24,287 --> 00:26:27,199
as you march off
to do your duty,

409
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:29,960
- I want you to keep one thing in mind:
- [Crash]

410
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:33,483
Dead men do not
buy dog food!

411
00:26:33,567 --> 00:26:36,798
So, big smiles
and get out there...

412
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:40,197
and fetch!

hard cash soon, we are Doberman chow.

416
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:50,366
Come on.

417
00:26:50,447 --> 00:26:53,166
We'll start
on Columbus Avenue.

418
00:26:53,247 --> 00:26:56,637
- What kind of work do we do anyway?
- Investment banking, man.

419
00:26:56,727 --> 00:26:59,525
[Grunts] Didn't you read about us
in the Wall Street Journal?

420
00:26:59,607 --> 00:27:02,405
- Really?
- Yes. Captains of Industry.

421
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:04,364
Gosh! Can I be one too?

you got all ya need.

"After a little sightseeing,
we left Paris by car...

I won't be able to make it."

Is there anything wrong,
Jenny?

455
00:29:00,127 --> 00:29:01,958
Are your parents all right?

456
00:29:02,047 --> 00:29:05,517
- They're staying longer.
- Oh, don't worry.

457

I-I'm sure they'll be home

What have I done?
Poor thing.

be ashamed of yourself!
- I'm sure he's just fine.

- Run along, little fellow.
Go on, now. Shoo.

Why don't you be a lookout, man.
Yeah, that's it. Be a lookout.

474
00:30:02,047 --> 00:30:04,641
Okay.
What is a lookout?

475
00:30:04,727 --> 00:30:08,515
Aye! Look, just look
out the window.

one more wire, okay? [Grunting]

Jenny... are you all right?

486
00:30:49,087 --> 00:30:53,922
- Where's the kid?

be in the car, man.

[Rita]
Oh, that poor little kid.

488
00:30:56,567 --> 00:30:58,717
You were supposed
to keep an eye on him, Tito!

489
00:30:58,807 --> 00:31:01,719
[Coughing] Yeah. Well, it's hard
to watch anything...

490
00:31:01,807 --> 00:31:05,038
- when you're getting barbecued, man.
- What are we gonna do, Dodge?

491
00:31:05,127 --> 00:31:09,484
Tito, come with me.

Right, guys?

Allow me to introduce myself. I am

- Winston!
- [Sighs]

667
00:42:38,407 --> 00:42:41,683
- Excuse me, uh, sister. Who's Rex?
- None of your business!

668
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:45,123
And you, tubby,
off the bed!

669

- [Sniffing]
- Get away from there, you...

- [Sneezes]
- All right! That does it!

671
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:53,280
You yo-yos clear out
and I mean now!

672

Winston!
Bark! Bark!

673
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:59,724
Relax, champ.
We'll leave as soon as we get our cat.

674
00:42:59,807 --> 00:43:04,244
If you think I'm intimidated by a bunch
of flea-bitten, dog-pound rejects...

675
00:43:04,327 --> 00:43:07,160
Your cat?
[Giggles]

676
00:43:07,247 --> 00:43:10,922
How stupid of me. You must be
the friends he keeps talking about.

677
00:43:11,007 --> 00:43:13,043
- Yes.
- [Winston] Georgette.

678
00:43:13,127 --> 00:43:15,721
Something's not
quite right here.

679
00:43:25,367 --> 00:43:29,121
Shh. Quick.
Before he comes back. Follow me.

680
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:34,486
Look at him, Dodger. Honey,
let's just forget the whole thing.

681
00:43:34,567 --> 00:43:37,445
No, no, you can't do that!
You don't understand.

682
00:43:37,527 --> 00:43:40,883
- The poor dear's so traumatized.
- [Winston] Georgette.

683
00:43:40,967 --> 00:43:43,720
- Huh? What?
- [Winston] What is going on here?

684
00:43:43,807 --> 00:43:46,560
Now get going. Hurry.
Use the fire escape.

- [Francis Grunting]

686
00:43:48,887 --> 00:43:52,846

but here's something to remember me by.

- [Oliver] What?

692
00:44:07,327 --> 00:44:10,876
- Nicejob, Dodger.
- Hey, wait. What's goin' on, you guys?

693
00:44:10,967 --> 00:44:12,685
Just the rescue of the century.

694
00:44:12,767 --> 00:44:14,485
- Should've seen Frankie handle
that butler.
- Rescue?

- [Howling]
- I was rather good, wasn't I?

696
00:44:18,207 --> 00:44:21,882
And how about Tito
and Miss Six-Time National Champion?

697
00:44:21,967 --> 00:44:24,845
Hey, hey, but, wait.
I-I-I don't understand you guys.

- You okay, kid?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

699
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:31,199
Hey, sure he is!
He's back with his Uncle Tito.

700
00:44:31,287 --> 00:44:34,597
I was happy there.
Why did you guys take me away?

701
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:40,202
We rescued you, kitty.
We, we brought you home.

702
00:44:40,287 --> 00:44:43,723
But... Well, I, I have
another home now.

703
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:45,923
And someone who loves me.

704
00:44:46,007 --> 00:44:49,363
What do you mean, kid?
You're in the gang.

705
00:44:49,447 --> 00:44:53,201
- But, but...
- The gang means family.

706
00:44:53,287 --> 00:44:56,199
We risked a lot
to get you outta there.

707
00:44:56,287 --> 00:44:59,085
Look, I'm sorry,
but all I ever wanted was...

708
00:44:59,167 --> 00:45:01,476
What? This place is not
good enough for you any more?

709
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,762
Don't wanna mix
with the riffraff?

710
00:45:03,847 --> 00:45:08,204
No, no. I like you. I mean, I like...
I like every one of you, but...

711
00:45:08,287 --> 00:45:12,678
But there was a little girl.
I just wanna go back.

712
00:45:12,767 --> 00:45:16,157
[Sighs]
We never should've took him, Dodger.

713
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:20,160
- But, Dodger, please...
- You wanna leave? Fine!
There's the door.

714
00:45:20,247 --> 00:45:24,035
- But he just got here.
- Go on. No one's stoppin'ya.

Hey, uh, Dodger, man,
uh, lighten up.

So that's where
you've been!

724
00:46:14,807 --> 00:46:18,083
Looks like you're doing
all right for yourself, Oliver.

725
00:46:18,167 --> 00:46:22,240
Your owner probably spends
more money on catnip...

726
00:46:22,327 --> 00:46:24,602
than we do on food
in a month.

727
00:46:24,687 --> 00:46:26,917
He's probably worried
sick about you.

728
00:46:27,007 --> 00:46:30,920
All alone in that big house
with only his money to comfort him.

729
