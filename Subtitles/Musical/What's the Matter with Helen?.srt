that I have here.

1216
01:35:02,229 --> 01:35:03,457
Certainly.

1217
01:35:12,405 --> 01:35:13,667
You don't know him?

1218
01:35:14,474 --> 01:35:15,498
No.

1219
01:35:15,775 --> 01:35:18,539
- You've never seen him before?
- No.

1220
01:35:18,845 --> 01:35:23,282
They found his body just three days ago
in that trench right across the street there.

1221
01:35:23,950 --> 01:35:25,850
Yes, that dreadful accident.

1222
01:35:25,986 --> 01:35:27,647
He knew Ellie Banner.

1223
01:35:28,655 --> 01:35:31,920
He was her lover.

1224
01:35:34,761 --> 01:35:37,491
What an extraordinary coincidence.

1225
01:35:37,664 --> 01:35:38,961
I see.

1226
01:35:39,733 --> 01:35:42,224
<i>I see, that's why you thought that...</i>

1227
01:35:44,871 --> 01:35:47,567
I'm sorry, Sergeant, I can't help you.

1228
01:35:50,944 --> 01:35:53,310
Mrs. Hill, didn't you or Mrs. Bruckner...

1229
01:35:53,380 --> 01:35:55,848
...ever receive any
threatening telephone calls?

1230
01:35:56,316 --> 01:35:57,874
Why, no.

1231
01:35:59,552 --> 01:36:01,850
It's a thing they often do.

1232
01:36:02,222 --> 01:36:03,280
Who?

1233
01:36:04,591 --> 01:36:07,788
Well, the important thing is,
you're out of danger now.

1234
01:36:08,028 --> 01:36:09,120
I am?

1235
01:36:10,730 --> 01:36:12,755
That's always nice to know.

1236
01:36:14,034 --> 01:36:15,968
Wait a minute, Sergeant.

1237
01:36:16,736 --> 01:36:19,170
<i>You mean, Ms. Stuart...</i>

1238
01:36:19,673 --> 01:36:21,766
I mean, Mrs. Bruckner...

1239
01:36:22,542 --> 01:36:27,445
...and myself were in danger
from this man who loved Ellie Banner?

1240
01:36:27,814 --> 01:36:30,146
Yes, from what he said
to a couple of people...

1241
01:36:30,216 --> 01:36:32,582
...he was crazy with the idea of revenge.

1242
01:36:32,652 --> 01:36:35,416
Of course,
he suffered greatly when she died.

1243
01:36:35,488 --> 01:36:40,152
Your boys were out of reach, of course,
and so he fixed on their mothers.

1244
01:36:41,127 --> 01:36:43,322
He traced you out here.

1245
01:36:50,136 --> 01:36:52,764
I think you've had a very lucky escape.

1246
01:36:55,809 --> 01:36:56,798
Yes.

1247
01:36:58,745 --> 01:37:00,610
It's all been quite a shock.

1248
01:37:02,649 --> 01:37:04,480
I can't stand violence.

1249
01:37:04,951 --> 01:37:06,441
It's unforgivable.

1250
01:37:07,387 --> 01:37:10,117
<i>You see, Sergeant,
that's why when my boy...</i>

1251
01:37:13,026 --> 01:37:15,551
Do you mind
if I tell Mrs. Bruckner about this?

1252
01:37:15,662 --> 01:37:17,459
Yes, that's perfectly all right.

1253
01:37:17,530 --> 01:37:19,395
Well, that's about it.

1254
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:22,191
I'll just let myself out.

1255
01:37:23,169 --> 01:37:24,830
Yes. Good-bye.

1256
01:37:26,806 --> 01:37:27,830
Sergeant?

1257
01:37:30,276 --> 01:37:32,005
Forgive me.

1258
01:37:32,779 --> 01:37:34,576
I didn't even thank you...

1259
01:37:34,647 --> 01:37:37,514
...or ask you if you'd like
a cup of coffee or something?

1260
01:37:37,617 --> 01:37:41,678
No, that's perfectly all right.
Thank you again, ma'am, and good night.

1261
01:37:43,890 --> 01:37:45,221
Thank you.

Adelle, darling!

1265
01:37:56,069 --> 01:37:58,629
It was him! It was that man!

Adelle?

1269
01:39:15,048 --> 01:39:16,606
Uh, now,
just a minute, please.
Shh.

1270
01:39:17,350 --> 01:39:20,547
My partner is
not quite finished
with our recital yet.
