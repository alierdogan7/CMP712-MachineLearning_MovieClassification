1
00:03:35,241 --> 00:03:36,868
Where are you, Kaajal?

2
00:03:37,243 --> 00:03:39,211
I am here,
getting your breakfast ready.

3
00:03:39,746 --> 00:03:41,714
Forget the breakfast, darling.
I am already late.

4
00:03:41,914 --> 00:03:43,882
No way! Have your breakfast first!

5
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,808
You are too much!

6
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:51,687
Smelling good? What's the matter?

7
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:54,660
And looking very handsome too!

8
00:03:55,628 --> 00:03:58,256
Where are you headed to?
- Think positive, darling!

9
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:00,829
Where else can I go except to office
that too so early in the morning?

10
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:03,662
Well, you seem to be dressed
up for a date!

11
00:04:06,306 --> 00:04:07,773
Hey...
- Okay now?

12
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,767
I was just joking!
Why do you get so serious?

13
00:04:11,244 --> 00:04:12,734
It always starts as a joke...

14
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,744
to develop into a series of questions
suspecting me...

15
00:04:14,914 --> 00:04:16,882
making me late for office everyday!
I have so much work pending today.

16
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,648
Why? Don't you have work everyday?

17
00:04:22,455 --> 00:04:24,787
At least listen to me, Kishan!
- What should I listen?

18
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:27,757
Why don't you schedule this
interrogation for Sundays?

19
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:30,695
I can't really help it! Every morning,
I wake up with a resolve...

20
00:04:30,897 --> 00:04:33,525
...that I will not doubt you,
but it all goes kaput in a short while.

21
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:35,860
Please forgive me!

22
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,538
Have this toast at least.

23
00:04:41,307 --> 00:04:44,868
I'll eat this toast later.
Let me hug you first.

24
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:48,871
I love you.
- Enough! Go on, now.

25
00:04:53,353 --> 00:04:56,652
Hey! What are you doing?
- Watching TV.

26
00:04:57,523 --> 00:04:59,753
Switch it off and attend
to your chores! Go!

27
00:05:01,627 --> 00:05:04,596
Listen! What is that you are wearing?

28
00:05:05,698 --> 00:05:08,326
A sari and a blouse!
- I know that!

29
00:05:09,202 --> 00:05:12,569
But why all these openings behind?
- For air circulation!

30
00:05:12,905 --> 00:05:15,271
Well, you see, you have ACs,
coolers, everything.

31
00:05:15,575 --> 00:05:17,668
But this is the only arrangement
for me!

32
00:05:17,944 --> 00:05:21,175
Really! This won't work here.
If you want to work in this house...

33
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:24,607
...keep your AC and cooler covered!
Understood? Go!

34
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,881
Look at that! He talks of important
work at the office and...

35
00:05:29,222 --> 00:05:30,587
forgot to take the file

36
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,227
Kaajal!

37
00:05:35,628 --> 00:05:38,188
So many times I have asked you
to refrain from...

38
00:05:38,564 --> 00:05:40,532
you made me forget the file.

39
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:54,139
Hey, Lakshmi! Where is Kaajal?

40
00:05:55,848 --> 00:05:57,816
Madam has gone for her bath.
Won't be out before an hour.

41
00:06:00,853 --> 00:06:03,321
What's up?
You seem to be in a bad mood.

42
00:06:04,524 --> 00:06:06,822
You ask me to wear such
AC-cooler blouses!

43
00:06:07,193 --> 00:06:10,492
Madam says that it's not done!
To whom should I listen?

44
00:06:11,864 --> 00:06:15,766
Neither to me nor to her!
Just listen to your heart, Lakshmi!

45
00:06:44,263 --> 00:06:48,632
Is it a really an important file?
- No... just a namesake file!

46
00:07:06,185 --> 00:07:07,812
What happened, madam?

47
00:07:08,187 --> 00:07:10,485
What happened, madam?
Sir left a long time ago.

48
00:07:14,193 --> 00:07:16,161
Nothing! Disperse!

49
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,535
Listen!
- Yes, madam.

50
00:07:23,803 --> 00:07:25,771
Here's your salary.
Don't report to work from tomorrow!

51
00:07:26,205 --> 00:07:28,173
What have I done?
- You haven't done anything yet, right?

52
00:07:28,374 --> 00:07:29,841
But you will surely end up doing
something, someday!

53
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:32,507
I need a maid for this house and
not a heroine!

54
00:07:32,712 --> 00:07:34,839
Madam, I said that I won't wear
such blouses.

55
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:37,216
Wear whatever and however you want to!

56
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,519
But not in this house! Ok?
Here you are! Get going!

57
00:07:41,554 --> 00:07:44,182
Ok, I'm leaving! However,
I will say something.

58
00:07:44,624 --> 00:07:46,854
I work in 10 houses.
And those women too have their men.

59
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:49,193
But no one thinks the way you do!

60
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:52,459
If you continue doing that, Sir will
get tired of you and find another

61
00:08:07,179 --> 00:08:09,579
You too? I was just explaining
this to her.

62
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:11,749
What kind of clothes you girls wear!

63
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:13,748
Sir, is there some problem
with this dress?

64
00:08:13,886 --> 00:08:17,549
Some problem? There are only problems!
It's...

65
00:08:18,257 --> 00:08:22,159
It's too revealing! Don't wear
such clothes to office, please!

66
00:08:22,662 --> 00:08:24,857
Your wife prompts you to say this,
isn't it, sir?

67
00:08:26,198 --> 00:08:29,326
What do you mean?
Does being henpecked make me upright?

68
00:08:29,702 --> 00:08:32,500
No, sir, it's the other way round.
- Shut up! Shut up!

69
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:35,172
What kind of a headline is this?

70
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:37,404
'Minister involved in sleazy sex! '

71
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,737
Don't you want this newspaper
to continue running?

72
00:08:40,212 --> 00:08:43,181
Publishing such a news without
proper evidence will...

73
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,847
No, sir, we will publish it only
after we have the evidence.

74
00:08:46,385 --> 00:08:48,353
It must be here any moment now.

75
00:08:50,323 --> 00:08:53,121
I know Shekhar won't relent without
shutting this newspaper down.

76
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:39,861
Now this is something

77
00:10:03,696 --> 00:10:06,859
Don't do such risky works!
You are not just an employee for me.

78
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:08,825
You are my friend; my younger brother.

79
00:10:09,235 --> 00:10:11,203
You will land up in big trouble
some day!

80
00:10:11,404 --> 00:10:15,204
Sir... I can even lay down my life to
repay the favours you have done to me.

81
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:20,209
How can I forget the day
when I simply loitered around...

82
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,547
in a deprived and dishevelled state?

83
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:25,816
You were the one who supported
and helped me then.

84
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:29,688
But... you never mentioned
about your family till date.

85
00:10:32,324 --> 00:10:34,952
You seem to belong to
a well-to-do family.

86
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:39,390
What do you mean by 'seem to belong'?
I do belong to one.

87
00:10:40,032 --> 00:10:42,694
I mean, what brings you to this city
all of a sudden and...

88
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:45,567
that too in such a state?

89
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:52,673
Sir... my father had a cap-business.

90
00:10:54,213 --> 00:10:56,841
And his partner actually
capped him one day.

91
00:10:57,683 --> 00:11:00,846
The land, the property, the money,
he grabbed everything.

92
00:11:02,888 --> 00:11:06,688
Since nothing else was left, this cap
was his only inheritance to me.

93
00:11:10,262 --> 00:11:13,197
Anyway, sir... which one among these
photos should we publish?

94
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:16,599
None of these!

95
00:11:17,236 --> 00:11:19,295
Sir, I literally snatched these
photos from a dog's mouth!

96
00:11:19,572 --> 00:11:22,473
Sunny! Enmity with ministers
can cost us dearly!

97
00:11:23,242 --> 00:11:25,642
Already our newspaper is in the red,
do you now want it to shut shop?

98
00:11:25,945 --> 00:11:31,008
Nothing of the sort will happen, sir.
This would rather double up our sales!

99
00:11:31,617 --> 00:11:34,882
Women are in constant lookout for
a proof of their husband's affairs...

100
00:11:35,254 --> 00:11:38,781
...to enable them to put collars
around their necks!

101
00:11:39,925 --> 00:11:41,893
We will provide them
with the proof, sir.

102
00:11:42,495 --> 00:11:45,896
And after that... every morning...
women will make do without...

103
00:11:46,265 --> 00:11:47,892
the vegetables but
not without our newspaper...

104
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,394
...constantly anticipating their
husband's photograph in it

105
00:11:52,605 --> 00:11:55,733
Yes, Sunny! This will help half
the population of husbands...

106
00:11:55,941 --> 00:11:58,569
...secure divorce and the rest will
mend their ways on their own.

107
00:11:58,878 --> 00:12:00,846
But, what will be the fate of
our newspaper after that?

108
00:12:01,213 --> 00:12:03,181
It will continue to sell,
even after that.

109
00:12:03,382 --> 00:12:05,179
Every husband in the world can
mend his ways...

110
00:12:05,317 --> 00:12:09,185
but not your friend Prem!
- Yes!

111
00:12:09,655 --> 00:12:12,624
We will click his pictures! He couldn't
reform in his previous birth...

112
00:12:12,892 --> 00:12:15,520
not at all in this birth and will
never in his next birth even.

113
00:12:50,262 --> 00:12:53,595
"Just love me!"

114
00:12:54,366 --> 00:12:56,163
"Am I alone?"

115
00:12:56,702 --> 00:13:02,504
"Surrounded by pretty young things!"

116
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:11,179
"Just love me!"

117
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,775
"Am I alone?"

118
00:13:14,386 --> 00:13:20,188
"Surrounded by pretty young things!"

119
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:17,405
"The story of life is momentary."

120
00:14:18,217 --> 00:14:25,589
"The magic of youth, once
lost is gone forever."

121
00:14:26,558 --> 00:14:30,619
"All you pretty ones!"

122
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:34,730
"Come, let me embrace and
love you all."

123
00:14:35,301 --> 00:14:38,737
"Tomorrow is so unpredictable,
sweetheart!"

124
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:46,808
"Just love me!"

125
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:22,169
"I am known to be an admirer of
beauty by one and all."

126
00:15:22,648 --> 00:15:30,612
"Every girl gets bowled over
by my charisma!"

127
00:15:31,256 --> 00:15:34,851
"I live for fun and frolic!!"

128
00:15:35,327 --> 00:15:39,696
"Wild, wicked and wayward!"

129
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:43,531
"What's wrong with being one?"

130
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,539
"Just love me!"

131
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,598
What! What are you saying, Prem?

132
00:16:13,866 --> 00:16:16,164
You're already back and
I don't even know of it!

133
00:16:17,202 --> 00:16:21,502
Ok, but for your work in office you'd
have come home to surprise me, isn't it?

134
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:25,772
I can understand that you are
loaded with work.

135
00:16:26,245 --> 00:16:27,473
Just a minute... what is it?

136
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:30,173
Isn't the freedom you have given to
Prem on the higher side?

137
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:32,777
It's not good to trust
someone so blindly!

138
00:16:33,218 --> 00:16:35,686
Sister, leave my husband alone,
at least.

139
00:16:36,221 --> 00:16:39,190
You are so naive, Pooja!
You don't know how these men are...

140
00:16:39,558 --> 00:16:43,585
I know my Prem very well. Great virtues
earned in my previous birth.

141
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:46,196
...have got me a husband like him.

142
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,859
Look, come home early today. Bye.
- Bye, sweetheart!

143
00:16:52,604 --> 00:16:55,573
Why did you call your wife if you
don't even intend to go home?

144
00:16:55,841 --> 00:16:57,809
One should always be sure
about his wife.

145
00:16:58,177 --> 00:17:01,578
What if she spots me being
so close to you?

146
00:17:09,188 --> 00:17:11,383
Hi, brother! What a timely entry!

147
00:17:11,623 --> 00:17:14,148
Take some more snaps.

148
00:17:16,462 --> 00:17:20,558
Say how about this? C'mon,
go ahead. Go ahead... click it.

149
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,169
Didn't you like the pose?
Here is another one!

150
00:17:25,304 --> 00:17:27,704
Click, man! Don't waste time.

151
00:17:29,808 --> 00:17:31,435
Very good! This one too!

152
00:17:34,246 --> 00:17:36,510
When will I get the photographs?
- In the evening.

153
00:17:37,282 --> 00:17:38,977
But not you, your wife will get them.

154
00:17:39,785 --> 00:17:42,720
Why? Why my wife?
- Well... he wants it that way.

155
00:17:43,322 --> 00:17:44,880
Hey! You are my friend!
The photos are mine!

156
00:17:45,224 --> 00:17:46,714
And you will give them to my wife!
What kind of a friend are you?

157
00:17:46,925 --> 00:17:51,191
A true friend! And I can do anything
to bring him on the right path.

158
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:10,504
Kishan... I can't really understand.
Am I treading the wrong path?

159
00:18:11,183 --> 00:18:15,142
Aren't you?
You have such a good and trusting wife.

160
00:18:15,587 --> 00:18:17,817
And here you are with another girl!
Isn't this wrong?

161
00:18:18,257 --> 00:18:20,953
What's wrong with it!
Didn't you have a 'Maruti 800' before?

162
00:18:22,694 --> 00:18:25,162
So what?
- You bought a 'Zen' after that.

163
00:18:25,764 --> 00:18:27,288
Then, an 'Opel' and a 'Lancer'.

164
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:29,398
And you own a 'Mercedes Benz'
today, pal!

165
00:18:29,635 --> 00:18:31,262
I do. But what do you want to say?

166
00:18:31,537 --> 00:18:34,165
All that I want to ask is the reason
why you changed so many cars?

167
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:38,272
Well, driving the same car
can be so boring.

168
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,170
And one needs to change an old car,
isn't it?

169
00:18:41,547 --> 00:18:43,447
Right! And the wife?

170
00:18:47,219 --> 00:18:49,687
You changed 7 cars in the last 7 years!
But you still have the same wife!

171
00:18:50,222 --> 00:18:54,454
Are you crazy? Does one change his wife
like he changes his car?

172
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,119
Hey, you're right! We are upright guys
and that's why we don't change wives.

173
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:03,398
But is it some sin to board
another car for a while?

174
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:09,469
Pooja will answer this question for
you when she gets these pictures!

175
00:19:13,412 --> 00:19:16,813
Officer! Please come here.

176
00:19:17,216 --> 00:19:19,810
Please inform them about the gravity
of the crime of clicking pictures...

177
00:19:20,185 --> 00:19:22,312
...in such a high-security area.
- What are you doing?

178
00:19:22,588 --> 00:19:24,818
Sir, we were just clicking
our friend's pictures.

179
00:19:25,257 --> 00:19:27,157
Just for fun, sir!
- Are they your friends?

180
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,157
They are. But I cannot vouch
for any of them.

181
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:33,589
I don't want to get into any trouble
if a plane gets hijacked.

182
00:19:34,366 --> 00:19:38,166
Come with me.
- No, officer, just have a look.

183
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:41,828
There is no roll in it.
We were just joking.

184
00:19:42,274 --> 00:19:44,742
There is no roll? You were joking!
- Yes, we were joking.

185
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:48,179
It is fine then. In that case,
I can vouch for them. Thank you.

186
00:19:49,381 --> 00:19:51,178
I knew it, brother that...

187
00:19:51,383 --> 00:19:53,681
you can never click such
objectionable pictures of mine.

188
00:19:55,287 --> 00:19:57,847
One day, I will not only do it, Prem,
I will also publish them...

189
00:19:58,223 --> 00:20:01,249
...on the front-page of my newspaper!
Just like P. K. Gupta!

190
00:20:05,597 --> 00:20:07,189
What is this?

191
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:12,303
What is this?
- It's a photograph.

192
00:20:13,272 --> 00:20:15,206
Whose is it?
- Mine.

193
00:20:15,607 --> 00:20:18,201
It's yours! And who is with you?

194
00:20:18,577 --> 00:20:21,546
She is a girl.
- A girl! What is she to you?

195
00:20:22,247 --> 00:20:23,805
No one.
- No one?

196
00:20:24,249 --> 00:20:26,217
Then what are you doing with her?

197
00:20:29,254 --> 00:20:31,484
What am I doing? Just dancing!
Only in the picture not in reality!

198
00:20:31,723 --> 00:20:34,886
I am your wife and am not
'the public' to be fooled so easily!

199
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,785
Honestly, this is a conspiracy of
the opposition to defame me.

200
00:20:38,263 --> 00:20:41,232
Listen carefully! I will kill you
and myself become a widow...

201
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:44,229
if ever I see you dancing in a
photograph even.

202
00:20:51,943 --> 00:20:55,606
That journalist really messed up
P. K. Gupta's life.

203
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,712
This suicide case is going to kill me.

204
00:20:59,918 --> 00:21:01,783
I haven't written a single line
in the past half an hour...

205
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,888
and this news needs to go in
tomorrow's newspaper.

206
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:11,787
Did he throw it for you?

207
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,198
I wish it is for me.

208
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:16,760
C'mon, read it fast.
Let's see what's written.

209
00:21:17,703 --> 00:21:19,864
I can't live without you.

210
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:23,537
Wherever you are,
I want to be there with you.

211
00:21:24,676 --> 00:21:27,577
I am leaving this world for you.

212
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:31,876
Everything will be done.
Have this tea first.

213
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,877
He's contemplating suicide.

214
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:36,219
He's so cute.

215
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:42,658
Losing in love makes a person
so lifeless!

216
00:21:43,795 --> 00:21:46,229
Even the tea tastes bitter to him.

217
00:21:47,332 --> 00:21:49,630
Add some sugar, at least.
- Yeah, sure.

218
00:21:50,001 --> 00:21:53,835
Sanjana, such a handsome guy and
he wants to commit suicide?

219
00:21:54,306 --> 00:21:56,706
And that too for his dead girl-friend.

220
00:21:57,209 --> 00:21:59,177
We should save him.

221
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,511
Hey, where has he disappeared?

222
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:07,546
C'mon, girls.

223
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,781
Hey mister, where's your friend?
- At the suicide point.

224
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,192
Suicide point and you didn't even
bother to stop him?

225
00:22:14,393 --> 00:22:16,861
Well he's my friend and he's doing
a good job. Why should I stop him?

226
00:22:17,229 --> 00:22:18,890
You are his friend?

227
00:22:19,598 --> 00:22:22,624
You should be ashamed of yourself...
stupid. C'mon girls, follow me.

228
00:22:29,674 --> 00:22:31,642
Wow! What a place!

229
00:22:33,245 --> 00:22:35,543
How can people commit
suicide from here?

230
00:22:44,256 --> 00:22:47,783
'Champa, because I couldn't
embrace you... '

231
00:22:48,593 --> 00:22:51,619
'I am embracing death! Your Champak! '

232
00:22:52,264 --> 00:22:53,162
How stupid!

233
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,165
What must he have said before dying?

234
00:23:01,206 --> 00:23:02,901
He must have definitely taken his
girl-friend's name.

235
00:23:03,275 --> 00:23:04,833
Champa...!!!

236
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,515
I am coming!!!

237
00:23:17,556 --> 00:23:21,185
It's his bike.
- Sanjana, he's there.

238
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,518
Champa...!!!

239
00:23:26,898 --> 00:23:29,526
Hey, stop.
- Wait...

240
00:23:30,235 --> 00:23:32,362
Hey stop... wait, what...

241
00:23:32,737 --> 00:23:35,205
No, wait... stop what are you doing?

242
00:23:35,574 --> 00:23:37,872
What are you trying to do?

243
00:23:38,743 --> 00:23:41,610
Hello, scoot from here.
- Scoot, but why?

244
00:23:41,947 --> 00:23:43,812
Who are you?
- That doesn't matter.

245
00:23:44,015 --> 00:23:46,483
I won't let you do what you have
come here for.

246
00:23:46,685 --> 00:23:49,552
Why won't you let me?
Do you own this Suicide Point?

247
00:23:49,855 --> 00:23:52,551
This is a public property and
I'll do as I wish.

248
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:55,157
So you won't relent?
- No!

249
00:23:55,427 --> 00:23:57,395
C'mon, get hold of him.

250
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:09,507
Help... help...
Pull me up...

251
00:24:09,841 --> 00:24:12,173
How will we pull him up,
we are not equipped.

252
00:24:12,611 --> 00:24:14,579
Hey, what are you doing?

253
00:24:15,213 --> 00:24:17,181
I can't let a cute guy die like this.

254
00:24:17,482 --> 00:24:19,450
That's why I am taking off my skirt...
you also take off you pants.

255
00:24:19,651 --> 00:24:22,711
You take off yours too. We'll turn it
into a makeshift rope and pull him up.

256
00:24:23,722 --> 00:24:26,350
My hands are slipping.
Pull me out of here.

257
00:24:26,992 --> 00:24:28,960
Hey, he's slipping. C'mon, be quick.

258
00:24:31,897 --> 00:24:35,196
Seems, they've gone from here.
Is someone else there?

259
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:41,530
I am not here.
Pull me up.

260
00:24:44,342 --> 00:24:47,368
Hold it and come up.

261
00:24:47,913 --> 00:24:49,505
Pull him up...

262
00:25:05,196 --> 00:25:08,688
'Get out of here, Sunny! They've
got another weapon to kill you.'

263
00:25:27,686 --> 00:25:30,177
That's a nice style of expressing
gratitude!

264
00:25:33,525 --> 00:25:35,493
Hey, he's going.

265
00:25:36,227 --> 00:25:38,787
Fast, note down his bike number.
- But why?

266
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:40,862
We'll inform his family that...

267
00:25:41,232 --> 00:25:44,201
he wants to commit suicide.
Then it's upto him and his family.

268
00:25:44,603 --> 00:25:46,867
01-222. BA-01-222.

269
00:25:49,274 --> 00:25:52,209
I'll tell you about your past
and your future...

270
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,137
I'll tell you everything.

271
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:56,810
I'll make predictions about your
destiny, you handsome couple.

272
00:25:57,449 --> 00:25:59,679
Let's ask him,
when will we have our kid?

273
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:03,677
Kaajal, the world has reached the moon
and you want to ask this parrot?

274
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,817
Okay, we'll ask him. Come...

275
00:26:07,225 --> 00:26:09,716
Come and get your predictions,
handsome couple.

276
00:26:10,261 --> 00:26:13,719
Tell me first, which parrot is going
to make the predictions?

277
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:17,733
The parrot will point the card and
I'll make the predictions.

278
00:26:18,303 --> 00:26:20,828
Raja, tell me the number of this
gentleman.

279
00:26:21,339 --> 00:26:25,605
Number two.
- Number two! Aha!

280
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:29,180
Brother, you are so fortunate.
You are twice blessed.

281
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:31,176
You've two houses?
- Yes!

282
00:26:31,416 --> 00:26:33,179
You've two offices?
- Yes!

283
00:26:33,418 --> 00:26:35,511
You've got two cars?
- Of course!

284
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,188
And two wives?
- 100%

285
00:26:38,456 --> 00:26:39,616
What?

286
00:26:40,892 --> 00:26:42,757
Hey, what crap are you talking?

287
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:46,197
It's not crap. I am just reading
what's written here.

288
00:26:47,532 --> 00:26:51,263
Now, I know why
you were making excuses?

289
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:54,137
Please tell us some more.

290
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:58,641
He's got a child from
his second marriage.

291
00:26:59,177 --> 00:27:00,701
Child?
- Hey!

292
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:05,474
Kaajal, don't cry.
I don't have any child.

293
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,681
Kaajal, he's...
- Daddy...

294
00:27:12,524 --> 00:27:15,152
Daddy...
- He's not my kid, Kaajal!

295
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:19,355
I swear on you,
I don't even know him, Kaajal.

296
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:21,656
Then why is he coming
running towards you?

297
00:27:22,734 --> 00:27:25,635
Daddy... daddy, I want a balloon.

298
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,838
You want a balloon, come we'll
buy it for you.

299
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:32,573
Mister, keep you child in control,
he almost got me killed.

300
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:34,677
Spoilt my entire mood!

301
00:27:34,879 --> 00:27:36,710
Did you see that, Kaajal...
he's not my...

302
00:27:36,915 --> 00:27:40,180
The kid may not be yours
but you do have a second wife.

303
00:27:42,487 --> 00:27:44,182
Kaajal, listen to me...
- I know you very well.

304
00:27:44,389 --> 00:27:45,913
Listen to me, Kaajal! He's a fraud.

305
00:27:46,891 --> 00:27:49,689
Kaajal, why are you crying?
- What to say?

306
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:52,855
Today being a Sunday I thought to
take Kaajal out...

307
00:27:53,331 --> 00:27:55,128
...but that astrologer...

308
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:58,127
Hey, why don't we ask him, let us get
your predictions from him?

309
00:27:58,837 --> 00:28:01,465
Then we will come to know whether
he's genuine or a fraud.

310
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,134
Of course, why not?
Come, let's try our luck.

311
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:16,819
Just wait and see! The reality
will be out any moment.

312
00:28:17,188 --> 00:28:20,487
Raja, tell me this generous
gentleman's card number.

313
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:24,156
Number One.
- Number one? Aha!

314
00:28:27,198 --> 00:28:31,157
His heart complies with his
innocent face!

315
00:28:33,304 --> 00:28:36,239
What makes you take birth in this
dark age?

316
00:28:37,976 --> 00:28:40,843
You are really fortunate, sister,
that you've got...

317
00:28:41,212 --> 00:28:44,181
...a saint for a husband in these
wretched times.

318
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:47,651
And my prediction is that this
man has never...

319
00:28:47,886 --> 00:28:50,411
...laid his eyes on another woman
and will never do it.

320
00:28:50,622 --> 00:28:52,783
He's taken you as his wife for all
your future births.

321
00:28:53,158 --> 00:28:54,853
You are really blessed!

322
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:58,454
Did you hear that? Did you?

323
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,197
Kaajal...

324
00:29:00,565 --> 00:29:01,657
Kaajal... Pooja...

325
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:04,465
Don't cry, Kaajal.

326
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,638
Whatever, you had to speak about
me you did it for him...

327
00:29:07,906 --> 00:29:08,873
Your parrot, I'll...

328
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:12,142
Not the parrot but the money speaks,
my friend...

329
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,636
Money...!?

330
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:15,476
Come here...

331
00:29:15,847 --> 00:29:17,712
I have been trying hard to make
you understand but in vain.

332
00:29:17,916 --> 00:29:19,850
What is the most important thing
that God has given us?

333
00:29:20,185 --> 00:29:22,153
Brains. And why?
To use it to our advantage... to lie...

334
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,147
To have a few girlfriends on the sly.

335
00:29:24,355 --> 00:29:27,813
Few? I don't have even one and yet
she has tried to commit suicide twice.

336
00:29:28,326 --> 00:29:31,159
If I did have one then...
- Nothing will happen.

337
00:29:31,529 --> 00:29:33,394
I'll explain you the logic.

338
00:29:33,631 --> 00:29:35,599
A man is a very sensitive creature...

339
00:29:35,967 --> 00:29:38,731
...and that's why whenever
he has an extra-marital affair...

340
00:29:39,204 --> 00:29:41,729
...he feels guilty and showers
his wife with love...

341
00:29:42,207 --> 00:29:45,699
...making the wife think that
her husband loves her a lot.

342
00:29:46,878 --> 00:29:51,781
And when he doesn't have an affair,
he comes home, exhausted.

343
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:55,175
Quietly he slips into his pyjamas,
eats his dinner,

344
00:29:55,553 --> 00:29:58,681
watches television, fights
and goes off to sleep.

345
00:29:59,257 --> 00:30:01,521
And that's when a wife
starts suspecting that...

346
00:30:02,227 --> 00:30:04,559
her husband is having an affair.

347
00:30:07,232 --> 00:30:08,859
Why are you thinking so much?

348
00:30:09,234 --> 00:30:13,762
Do as I say and you will find Kaajal
happy just as Pooja is.

349
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:15,866
And that's my guarantee!

350
00:30:19,244 --> 00:30:22,213
I have just given you the idea and see
the result are evident.

351
00:30:22,914 --> 00:30:25,212
That's nice.
- Isn't it? Then it's fun from now on.

352
00:30:26,651 --> 00:30:28,778
What is going on, Kaajal!
Wipe your tears.

353
00:30:29,254 --> 00:30:30,881
I can't see you like this.

354
00:30:31,256 --> 00:30:33,224
Okay, fine...
everything will be alright.

355
00:30:33,524 --> 00:30:36,755
Tonight, I am taking him for dinner
with me. So he'll be late.

356
00:30:37,295 --> 00:30:39,229
Why should I worry
when you are around?

357
00:30:39,664 --> 00:30:41,757
But make him understand.
Teach him something.

358
00:30:42,267 --> 00:30:45,236
Make him just like you, Prem!
- Did you hear that?

359
00:30:46,037 --> 00:30:47,834
Be ready tonight.
- Where are you taking me?

360
00:30:48,339 --> 00:30:50,569
Just come along.

361
00:31:05,523 --> 00:31:08,185
"Hi gorgeous!"

362
00:31:22,273 --> 00:31:24,707
"A few lost their fortunes!"

363
00:31:27,712 --> 00:31:29,680
"A few their beats!"

364
00:31:33,251 --> 00:31:35,219
"Yet others lost their lives!"

365
00:31:38,356 --> 00:31:40,551
"While the rest lost
their whole worlds!"

366
00:31:44,262 --> 00:31:47,231
"A few lost their fortunes and beats!"

367
00:31:47,598 --> 00:31:51,227
"Yet other lost their lives and
their worlds!

368
00:31:51,502 --> 00:31:54,699
"The whole of country was robbed!"

369
00:31:55,273 --> 00:32:02,179
"The lane of love has a - No Entry!"

370
00:32:17,395 --> 00:32:19,625
"They all get my charms..."

371
00:32:21,232 --> 00:32:23,427
"those who come across me"

372
00:32:24,669 --> 00:32:26,796
"They go crazy..."

373
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:30,298
"dreaming about me"

374
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,776
"My eyes are intoxicating,
my nuances, sensuous"

375
00:32:42,253 --> 00:32:44,744
"Anyone who sees me,
falls for me"

376
00:32:46,257 --> 00:32:49,385
"The lane of love has a - No Entry!"

377
00:33:14,986 --> 00:33:16,954
"My sweetheart, O' my sweetie pie!"

378
00:33:20,224 --> 00:33:22,522
"Just listen to me, buttercups!"

379
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:32,797
"Let's enjoy this spring of love!"

380
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:36,368
"Let's trap the whole country!"

381
00:33:37,742 --> 00:33:44,204
"The lane of love should now have a
- Yes Entry!"

382
00:33:51,956 --> 00:33:57,519
"Getting love-struck is said
to be essential, my love!"

383
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:04,827
"All stories are incomplete
without love, sweetheart!"

384
00:34:13,211 --> 00:34:16,305
"Meeting on the sly and exchanging
sweet-nothings..."

385
00:34:16,647 --> 00:34:19,514
"...is something everyone should
try at least once!"

386
00:34:24,555 --> 00:34:31,188
"The lane of love should now have a
- Yes Entry!"

387
00:34:49,347 --> 00:34:50,871
How come you are boozing tonight?

388
00:34:51,249 --> 00:34:55,151
My wife is at his house and so I have
a chance to get knocked out, today.

389
00:34:56,187 --> 00:34:58,849
Kishan! This is Bobby.

390
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:10,827
This is a club and not a temple.
Here, you meet like this.

391
00:35:11,802 --> 00:35:13,770
Kishan! Don't let her go.

392
00:35:15,206 --> 00:35:17,834
Prem, ask her to let go of me.
- No...

393
00:35:21,212 --> 00:35:22,702
Didn't you like it?

394
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,505
I like the perfume...
- What? Bobby...

395
00:35:27,885 --> 00:35:29,443
You liked only the perfume?

396
00:35:29,654 --> 00:35:32,179
Prem, Kaajal must be waiting for me.
Allow me to go now.

397
00:35:32,623 --> 00:35:34,591
Nice meeting you. Bye!

398
00:35:37,228 --> 00:35:40,197
Don't look at him, he's a married man.

399
00:35:40,565 --> 00:35:43,363
He loves his wife very much!
- Is that so?

400
00:35:46,237 --> 00:35:50,196
I'll pay you two hundred thousand
if you can to corrupt him.

401
00:35:51,642 --> 00:35:55,134
Two hundred thousand? Bet?
- Yes!

402
00:35:55,546 --> 00:36:00,574
Consider yourself having lost it!

403
00:36:01,185 --> 00:36:02,812
Bobby, come here.
- Coming.

404
00:36:03,254 --> 00:36:04,482
Hey wait...

405
00:36:09,927 --> 00:36:11,554
Okay, bye...

406
00:36:12,863 --> 00:36:14,160
Prem...

407
00:36:14,632 --> 00:36:18,830
Prem, what kind of a trap are
you setting that poor guy in?

408
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:24,164
He's not a poor guy. He clicks
my objectionable photographs!

409
00:36:25,209 --> 00:36:31,170
Just let me get something against him
and I won't spare him.

410
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:43,623
You know, what the ladies were saying?
- What?

411
00:36:44,228 --> 00:36:47,197
They were saying, that we have been
celebrating 'Janmashtmi'

412
00:36:47,398 --> 00:36:52,700
...for so many years now. Very soon we
will be blessed with a child like him.

413
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:58,470
Be positive! Surely and very
soon we will have one!

414
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:10,550
What fragrance is this?

415
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:16,489
Well... it's a perfume...
- Even I know that?

416
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:21,494
But this is some new one...
not the regular one.

417
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:26,701
Very true... One of Prem's
friends had put it on me.

418
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:32,437
He has a perfume store.
I resisted a lot but he had his way.

419
00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:37,180
So, what's the problem?
- Problem?

420
00:37:37,481 --> 00:37:42,509
It's a nice one. You should use it.
- Is that so?

421
00:37:42,887 --> 00:37:44,855
I'll bring some sweets for you.

422
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:54,622
What is this, Lord? Everyday,
my truths get me a solid bashing.

423
00:37:55,766 --> 00:37:58,599
And my first lie in life earns
me sweets!?

424
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:03,631
It's not difficult to fool the wives.

425
00:38:05,176 --> 00:38:08,145
Should I step in the 'No Entry' zone,
just like Prem?

426
00:38:09,613 --> 00:38:14,141
No, no... it's not good
to deceive one's wife.

427
00:38:15,353 --> 00:38:17,821
But I surely liked what happened today.

428
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:22,759
What did you like?
- Everything?

429
00:38:24,195 --> 00:38:25,753
Isn't Pooja at home?

430
00:38:25,963 --> 00:38:27,828
She's gone home...
- What?

431
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:29,723
She asked me to go to her
place tomorrow...

432
00:38:29,867 --> 00:38:31,698
from where we will go to visit the
temple.

433
00:38:32,203 --> 00:38:35,832
Prem won't be spared today. He will
reach home drunk to find Pooja there!

434
00:38:36,674 --> 00:38:38,642
Let me relish the sweets on this!

435
00:39:03,434 --> 00:39:05,402
You had a drink?

436
00:39:07,605 --> 00:39:12,804
Don't ask my whether I had it.
Ask me why I had it.

437
00:39:13,377 --> 00:39:14,344
Why?

438
00:39:14,545 --> 00:39:20,677
That's because one of our employees
tried molesting a female staff member.

439
00:39:21,252 --> 00:39:26,656
He misbehaved with her.

440
00:39:27,191 --> 00:39:31,685
When I asked him the reason of his
behaviour...

441
00:39:32,263 --> 00:39:38,566
he said that she appeared to be his
wife to him in his inebriated state.

442
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,638
So, I gave him a tight slap.

443
00:39:42,606 --> 00:39:47,168
Sobbing, he started saying that since
I am a gentleman...

444
00:39:47,545 --> 00:39:52,175
who has never had a drink,
I would never come to know...

445
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:56,714
...that every woman appears to
be one's wife, when one is drunk.

446
00:39:57,221 --> 00:39:59,712
So, I immediately bought one
bottle and drank it all.

447
00:40:00,624 --> 00:40:02,592
You drank one whole bottle?

448
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:07,194
Just because he had a full bottle,
I did the same.

449
00:40:09,233 --> 00:40:10,200
Then?

450
00:40:10,401 --> 00:40:15,634
Then I asked the staff girls
to stand in a line.

451
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:19,536
And then I recognised them
by their respective names.

452
00:40:20,344 --> 00:40:22,312
None of them appeared me to be
my wife among them.

453
00:40:22,613 --> 00:40:28,210
So, I called him and said that when
I couldn't see my wife in them...

454
00:40:28,419 --> 00:40:29,886
how could he?

455
00:40:30,254 --> 00:40:31,881
He kept quiet and others were stunned.

456
00:40:32,323 --> 00:40:35,554
I thrashed him,
caught him by his hair...

457
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:40,797
and said, 'You are maligning the
spirit of liquor.'

458
00:40:41,465 --> 00:40:45,231
'Have you ever treated
your mother or...

459
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,568
sister as you wife in
an inebriated state?

460
00:40:50,608 --> 00:40:52,735
I pushed him and
sacked him then and there.

461
00:40:56,213 --> 00:40:58,181
Did I do something wrong?

462
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:01,680
You've never wronged anyone.

463
00:41:02,486 --> 00:41:06,183
I know... I know,
your husband is very strong.

464
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:19,196
O Lord! Make Pooja my wife
in all my births!

465
00:41:26,243 --> 00:41:28,336
Hey! Prem, you seem to be very
happy today.

466
00:41:28,579 --> 00:41:31,946
Whenever my scoundrel friends land
in a soup, it gives me great joy.

467
00:41:32,583 --> 00:41:34,915
Which friend of yours has landed
in a soup, pal?

468
00:41:35,286 --> 00:41:37,618
Not already landed but
Kishan is about to!

469
00:41:37,922 --> 00:41:39,890
I have sent Bobby after him.

470
00:41:40,257 --> 00:41:42,623
But, he's an upright guy.

471
00:41:42,927 --> 00:41:44,895
No matter how upright
a person may be...

472
00:41:45,262 --> 00:41:49,221
seeing a bombshell like Bobby
is sure to make him falter.

473
00:41:50,267 --> 00:41:51,234
Very true!

474
00:41:51,435 --> 00:41:54,404
Bobby has taken him out shopping.
- You are a first rate scoundrel.

475
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:59,905
What are you scared for? I'm not
going to fleece you like your wife.

476
00:42:03,213 --> 00:42:08,173
I'm tired.
- Oh come on! Let's check out there.

477
00:42:12,022 --> 00:42:13,580
May I buy a necklace?

478
00:42:19,897 --> 00:42:21,592
How's this?
- Nice.

479
00:42:21,966 --> 00:42:23,524
Put it on me.

480
00:42:39,984 --> 00:42:43,818
What's wrong, sis?
- I think I saw Kishan with some girl.

481
00:42:44,254 --> 00:42:46,779
You go a bit overboard with this
habit of suspecting him.

482
00:42:47,257 --> 00:42:49,225
You always feel that he is with
some or the other girl.

483
00:42:49,393 --> 00:42:51,657
It's not an imagination.
I actually saw him.

484
00:43:20,491 --> 00:43:21,890
Hello! Sunrise Publications!

485
00:43:22,493 --> 00:43:23,755
Sunny, it's me.

486
00:43:24,328 --> 00:43:26,660
Me? Who?
- It's me! Kishan!

487
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:28,861
Sir, your voice sounds so different.

488
00:43:29,233 --> 00:43:32,725
Sunny, transfer my cabin phone
to my mobile.

489
00:43:33,704 --> 00:43:36,195
Why do you worry, sir?
I'm here to take messages for you.

490
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:39,441
And I will finish you off! Transfer
the line immediately or else...

491
00:43:39,643 --> 00:43:42,203
I will get you transferred.
- Okay, sir.

492
00:43:48,485 --> 00:43:49,918
What are you doing?
- I'm calling up at his office.

493
00:43:50,254 --> 00:43:51,221
Office?

494
00:43:56,593 --> 00:43:57,821
Where are you, Kishan?

495
00:43:58,195 --> 00:44:00,755
In Paris. About to jump down
from the Eiffel Tower.

496
00:44:01,198 --> 00:44:03,166
Why do you say so?
- What else should I do?

497
00:44:03,467 --> 00:44:05,162
Where have you called up?
At the office, isn't it?

498
00:44:05,369 --> 00:44:06,768
Where else would I be other
than the office?

499
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:08,767
Hey! Sunny, just get my files please.

500
00:44:09,206 --> 00:44:11,572
Tell me what is it? I've a lot of work.
- Nothing.

501
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:14,435
I just called up as I was missing you.
You are unnecessarily getting upset.

502
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,348
Where is he?
- In office.

503
00:44:26,557 --> 00:44:28,525
What happened?
Why are you so scared?

504
00:44:28,759 --> 00:44:31,193
Where the heck have you brought me?
My wife is here.

505
00:44:31,562 --> 00:44:34,690
I was wondering what made you vanish.
- Rather, I am going to vanish now.

506
00:44:35,232 --> 00:44:37,200
If she spots me with you,
this shopping centre...

507
00:44:37,401 --> 00:44:39,198
is going to vanish just like the WTC.

508
00:44:39,403 --> 00:44:42,201
Sorry. Bye.
- Hey!

509
00:44:45,676 --> 00:44:47,871
God knows when I'll get a chance
to earn 200,000!

510
00:44:56,854 --> 00:44:58,151
What happened?

511
00:44:59,723 --> 00:45:02,715
It's his car.
- Yes, it's Kishan's car.

512
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:07,560
But why is it here?
- That means he lied to me.

513
00:45:11,802 --> 00:45:13,770
I'm doomed. O Bhagwan (God), save me!

514
00:45:14,271 --> 00:45:16,171
Did you call me? What's it?

515
00:45:16,573 --> 00:45:18,165
You?
- Yes. My name is Bhagwan.

516
00:45:18,308 --> 00:45:20,276
You called me, didn't you?
What is it?

517
00:45:20,477 --> 00:45:23,173
No, not you.
I was remembering the Almighty!

518
00:45:23,447 --> 00:45:24,846
Ok. It's fine then.

519
00:45:31,288 --> 00:45:34,189
Yes, Kaajal.
- Are you still in the office, Kishan?

520
00:45:35,325 --> 00:45:38,692
Come here and see for yourself.
- No. I just need your car.

521
00:45:39,963 --> 00:45:42,523
It's parked outside the City Centre.
- Why?

522
00:45:42,766 --> 00:45:44,529
I went there for shopping, love.

523
00:45:44,902 --> 00:45:47,530
The car broke down. And the
driver is on his way there.

524
00:45:47,905 --> 00:45:52,467
Tell me where to send him.
- I too had come to the City Centre.

525
00:45:52,843 --> 00:45:54,811
Spotted your car,
so just enquired about it.

526
00:45:55,179 --> 00:45:57,477
You suspect me so much.
What would Pooja think?

527
00:45:58,248 --> 00:46:00,148
No, I am not suspecting...

528
00:46:01,251 --> 00:46:03,742
How do you know Pooja is with me?
- You are so naive.

529
00:46:04,221 --> 00:46:06,621
Have you ever been out for shopping
alone? I just made a guess.

530
00:46:07,257 --> 00:46:09,748
I will hang up now.
- Kiss me first.

531
00:46:10,861 --> 00:46:13,159
I'm disconnecting the line. Bye.
- Bye.

532
00:46:14,231 --> 00:46:15,823
O' God!

533
00:46:21,805 --> 00:46:23,773
My landlady threw my belongings
out of the house.

534
00:46:24,274 --> 00:46:25,832
She threw me out of the house.

535
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:28,178
That crazy female spread
the word that...

536
00:46:28,345 --> 00:46:31,178
I am committing suicide for
some girl named Champa.

537
00:46:32,216 --> 00:46:33,774
Who is this Champa?

538
00:46:37,221 --> 00:46:38,848
Laugh as much as you want.

539
00:46:39,223 --> 00:46:41,191
But tell me where I will stay now.

540
00:46:42,226 --> 00:46:44,194
She has rendered me homeless.

541
00:46:44,561 --> 00:46:46,529
Don't worry. Stay there.

542
00:46:47,231 --> 00:46:51,190
There? Outside?
- Not outside. Come here.

543
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:56,139
In my guesthouse.
It's locked since many years.

544
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,138
Here are the keys.

545
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:06,811
Is this house mine?
- Just to live in it.

546
00:47:16,627 --> 00:47:18,492
Your favours are piling up on me.

547
00:47:18,862 --> 00:47:20,762
How can I ever repay them?

548
00:47:21,198 --> 00:47:23,166
Don't worry about that, Sunny.

549
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,468
I will take it back with interest,
as and when needed.

550
00:47:25,802 --> 00:47:28,270
I am ready to lay my life for you,
brother! Kill me if I object.

551
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:32,769
Do that later. Get that house cleaned
first. It is infested with mice.

552
00:47:33,543 --> 00:47:36,842
I'll take care of the mice, sister.
But I dread that pest of a girl.

553
00:47:38,315 --> 00:47:40,283
See, I am already hiccupping.

554
00:47:41,718 --> 00:47:44,186
She is definitely plotting
something for me.

555
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:49,415
Sanjana, look there. Champa's lover.

556
00:47:54,598 --> 00:47:56,463
I think he has changed his mind.

557
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:00,136
No, in order to deceive others,
such people act happy.

558
00:48:00,604 --> 00:48:04,131
But they continue to suffer from
within. C'mon girls, let's go.

559
00:48:07,277 --> 00:48:09,643
Yes please?
- Do you have rat-poison?

560
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,375
Here's your rat-poison.
- Thank you!

561
00:48:12,582 --> 00:48:14,482
Give me Dettol as well.
- Dettol Soap too?!

562
00:48:15,185 --> 00:48:17,415
Dettol? Even in soap he's
searching for death.

563
00:48:17,621 --> 00:48:19,145
Can't he buy a 'Lifebuoy'?

564
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,489
But why is he buying a rope?

565
00:48:25,696 --> 00:48:29,462
To kill himself with the rope
if the rat-poison deceives him.

566
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,663
Thank you. Do keep coming.

567
00:48:57,294 --> 00:48:58,727
Peep in from there.

568
00:48:59,162 --> 00:49:01,130
Try to see what he's doing here?

569
00:49:07,504 --> 00:49:09,529
Hey, he's climbing on the chair.

570
00:49:12,175 --> 00:49:14,666
He's hanging the rope. O' my God!
- What happened?

571
00:49:15,178 --> 00:49:18,147
He's preparing to kill himself.
- Preparing to kill himself?

572
00:49:19,182 --> 00:49:21,742
Hey, open the door...
- Open the door.

573
00:49:22,185 --> 00:49:24,676
What should we do now?

574
00:49:25,288 --> 00:49:26,619
Go and call the neighbours.

575
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:28,687
Shout! He's trying to kill himself.

576
00:49:29,192 --> 00:49:31,160
Wait. Stop! Open the door!

577
00:49:43,306 --> 00:49:45,433
What are you doing?
- What are you trying to do?

578
00:49:45,742 --> 00:49:47,835
Who are you all?
- We are your neighbours.

579
00:49:48,211 --> 00:49:51,180
Why have you barged inside my house?
- Tell me what is bothering you?

580
00:49:51,448 --> 00:49:52,608
I am like a mother to you.

581
00:49:52,749 --> 00:49:55,616
Life is an invaluable gift of God.
Don't waste it like this.

582
00:49:55,986 --> 00:49:59,717
Trust my experience. Those who commit
suicide repent it bitterly after death.

583
00:50:00,223 --> 00:50:03,681
Yes, son. Look at me, I still want
to live for another 75 years.

584
00:50:04,227 --> 00:50:06,491
And you've given up to the challenges
of life at such a young age?

585
00:50:06,696 --> 00:50:11,190
Face them bravely.
- Yes, face them bravely.

586
00:50:16,573 --> 00:50:21,203
She's the one who told you everything,
didn't she?

587
00:50:21,511 --> 00:50:24,639
Yes, this innocent girl
saved your life.

588
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:28,215
What do you want, after all?

589
00:50:29,252 --> 00:50:33,621
I just want to know whether you are
still to consume the rat-poison...

590
00:50:33,924 --> 00:50:35,892
or have you already done it?

591
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:40,229
Listen, you'll have
to promise me that...

592
00:50:40,597 --> 00:50:43,623
you will never contemplate
suicide henceforth

593
00:50:44,501 --> 00:50:46,469
No, I'll never think about it.

594
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:50,569
But, I want to kill someone.
- Murder?

595
00:50:50,807 --> 00:50:54,709
What weapon should I use?
- Those doe-horns behind you...

596
00:50:57,214 --> 00:50:59,512
anyone would die if
you shove it in him.

597
00:51:05,222 --> 00:51:08,191
But whom do you want to kill?
- You!

598
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,195
Wait... where are you running to?

599
00:51:19,669 --> 00:51:21,534
I'll kill you and go to jail!

600
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,538
Stop there!
I'm not sparing you.

601
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:32,810
I've caught you...
where will you escape now?

602
00:51:34,885 --> 00:51:37,217
Have you gone crazy?
- No!

603
00:51:37,654 --> 00:51:39,622
I have rather come to
my senses now.

604
00:51:40,257 --> 00:51:42,725
You have maligned me in front
of the whole world.

605
00:51:43,426 --> 00:51:45,826
Wherever I go,
people start pitying me.

606
00:51:46,596 --> 00:51:50,828
They say that I am the poor guy
who wants to commit suicide.

607
00:51:52,469 --> 00:51:56,735
And people will keep visiting me
just to check whether...

608
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:58,669
I am dead or still alive.

609
00:51:59,209 --> 00:52:02,645
I want the world to help me
keeping a tab on you.

610
00:52:03,246 --> 00:52:06,340
I am just wishing good for you.

611
00:52:07,284 --> 00:52:09,514
Speak up, will you wish well for
me ever again?

612
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:11,687
Till my last breath.

613
00:52:12,656 --> 00:52:13,623
Why?

614
00:52:14,758 --> 00:52:15,850
Why?

615
00:52:18,662 --> 00:52:22,189
Because in today's world, the moment a
person's girlfriend is dead...

616
00:52:22,566 --> 00:52:26,593
he is in another girl's arms
in no time.

617
00:52:27,571 --> 00:52:29,869
And here you are...

618
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,209
who wants to give up his
life for Champa's love?

619
00:52:34,444 --> 00:52:36,207
Champa... Champa...

620
00:52:36,546 --> 00:52:39,640
Just see you get so deeply affected
by the mere mention of her name.

621
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:42,650
Where does one find such
a beloved these days?

622
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,880
Tell me, won't someone fall
in love with...

623
00:52:46,256 --> 00:52:48,383
a person who believes so much in love?
I love you.

624
00:52:48,825 --> 00:52:54,161
"In love!"

625
00:52:55,865 --> 00:53:02,168
"In love!"

626
00:53:04,541 --> 00:53:07,339
"In love!"

627
00:53:12,315 --> 00:53:19,585
"What has this love done to me?"

628
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:23,625
"Something seems to be impending..."

629
00:53:24,294 --> 00:53:27,593
"...something has already happened!"

630
00:53:28,698 --> 00:53:36,195
"My love, you are the goal of
my lovelorn heart."

631
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:43,603
"It doesn't rest in peace without you."

632
00:53:44,581 --> 00:53:51,646
"I have fallen in love with love!"

633
00:53:52,422 --> 00:54:00,158
"My love, you are the goal of
my lovelorn heart."

634
00:54:00,563 --> 00:54:03,327
"In love!"

635
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:31,626
"These fragrant meetings filled
with nervous emotions."

636
00:54:32,228 --> 00:54:39,725
"Something about you makes
me forget everything."

637
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:47,608
"This yearning of my loneliness,
scattered all over my rocking dreams..."

638
00:54:48,578 --> 00:54:55,142
"...has kept me engrossed since dusk."

639
00:54:56,519 --> 00:54:59,682
"Such a captivating tale of yours..."

640
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:03,819
"...makes my heart crave for you!"

641
00:55:04,394 --> 00:55:11,596
"What has this love done to me?"

642
00:55:12,535 --> 00:55:15,766
"Something seems to be impending..."

643
00:55:16,539 --> 00:55:19,702
"...something has already happened!"

644
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:28,183
"My love, you are the goal of
my lovelorn heart."

645
00:55:28,651 --> 00:55:31,347
"In love!"

646
00:55:54,911 --> 00:55:56,879
What has happened to you today,
Kaajal?

647
00:55:58,181 --> 00:56:00,672
There's this strange
warmth in your love.

648
00:56:06,756 --> 00:56:08,724
You? What are you doing here?

649
00:56:09,259 --> 00:56:11,489
I saw your wife going out.

650
00:56:12,495 --> 00:56:14,463
I thought, I shouldn't loose
this opportunity.

651
00:56:14,731 --> 00:56:16,494
So I came in.

652
00:56:19,536 --> 00:56:23,336
Try jumping in the sea of love once.

653
00:56:24,874 --> 00:56:28,275
One dip in it will never
let you want to come out.

654
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:32,773
Why are you so much after me?

655
00:56:34,651 --> 00:56:36,448
Even I don't know that.

656
00:56:36,886 --> 00:56:39,252
But I find you very alluring.

657
00:56:41,324 --> 00:56:44,293
Finding you before me makes my heart...

658
00:56:46,429 --> 00:56:48,397
...skip a beat.

659
00:56:49,732 --> 00:56:52,200
Listen, if my wife happens
to come here...

660
00:56:52,569 --> 00:56:55,800
not only are you going to get killed
for sure, she will also kill me.

661
00:56:56,239 --> 00:56:58,571
Such a henpecked man?

662
00:56:59,175 --> 00:57:02,736
Not henpecked. I love her a lot.
- So who's stopping you?

663
00:57:03,179 --> 00:57:07,639
Spend 23 hours with her and
allot me only one hour.

664
00:57:08,184 --> 00:57:09,845
I am head-over-heels in love with you.

665
00:57:10,353 --> 00:57:12,821
She might be back any moment now.

666
00:57:13,523 --> 00:57:15,718
You are being so inhospitable.

667
00:57:16,626 --> 00:57:19,595
Ask for a glass of water, at least.
- Right away.

668
00:57:46,222 --> 00:57:47,849
Here, take this...

669
00:57:48,391 --> 00:57:51,519
What happened?
- Nothing.

670
00:57:53,429 --> 00:57:55,454
For whom is this cold drink?

671
00:57:55,765 --> 00:57:59,132
What do you mean by 'for whom? '
It's for you, sweetheart!

672
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:04,571
You were out in the sun.
- One doesn't feel the sun in an AC car.

673
00:58:08,578 --> 00:58:10,409
What has happened to, you?

674
00:58:13,182 --> 00:58:14,740
I smell something fishy here.

675
00:58:14,951 --> 00:58:17,715
Fishy? But we have no fish in
the house. How can you smell it?

676
00:58:18,254 --> 00:58:20,620
Wow! What a beautiful dress!

677
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:24,482
You look so pretty and inviting.
I feel like loving you!

678
00:58:27,196 --> 00:58:28,891
Kishan, what's gone wrong
with you all of a sudden?

679
00:58:29,265 --> 00:58:31,495
Nothing has gone wrong!
It's all intentional.

680
00:58:31,868 --> 00:58:36,168
I really love you... I really
love you, Kaajal.

681
00:58:53,590 --> 00:58:56,184
He is so tensed and here you are,
laughing at him?

682
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:58,527
What else should I do? Shed tears?

683
00:58:59,228 --> 00:59:03,790
He is one great soul
who wants to steal mangoes...

684
00:59:04,167 --> 00:59:07,295
but is also scared of falling
off from the tree.

685
00:59:07,637 --> 00:59:10,538
Am I interested in Bobby?

686
00:59:10,873 --> 00:59:12,465
Are you asking this or
telling this to me?

687
00:59:12,675 --> 00:59:15,508
None of the two.
I am just cursing my luck...

688
00:59:15,945 --> 00:59:19,244
for having gone to the club with you
and getting trapped in this situation.

689
00:59:19,716 --> 00:59:22,583
I would have been ruined had
Kaajal spotted me.

690
00:59:23,186 --> 00:59:27,816
Is it? I will just call up Bobby
and tell her that Kishan hates her.

691
00:59:28,625 --> 00:59:30,593
Forget your home she won't
step even in your lane.

692
00:59:32,729 --> 00:59:35,493
Just see his face turning pale!

693
00:59:40,203 --> 00:59:42,603
Actually his boring
life suits him well.

694
00:59:43,206 --> 00:59:45,970
The same office, the same home
and the same wife.

695
00:59:48,745 --> 00:59:52,704
Forget bothering about Kaajal
and embrace Bobby.

696
00:59:53,216 --> 00:59:55,184
Do something, at least.

697
00:59:58,655 --> 01:00:02,182
Applying one's mind combined
with smart lies...

698
01:00:02,558 --> 01:00:05,186
will never get a man being caught
by his wife.

699
01:00:11,668 --> 01:00:14,193
Sister, it becomes
very tough for me...

700
01:00:14,504 --> 01:00:16,199
whenever you observe this vow of
silence.

701
01:00:16,406 --> 01:00:18,931
Do you know why is she
crying so bitterly?

702
01:00:19,442 --> 01:00:20,966
Only tomorrow will that be possible.

703
01:00:21,377 --> 01:00:23,675
She has never broken her vow of
silence in all these 7 years.

704
01:00:25,915 --> 01:00:27,883
I might as well come tomorrow.

705
01:00:31,054 --> 01:00:32,385
Listen...

706
01:00:33,256 --> 01:00:36,555
You broke your vow?
- I had to.

707
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:40,388
Kishan was expressing too much
love, yesterday.

708
01:00:40,797 --> 01:00:43,664
That's good, isn't it?
- Not good. It creates suspicion.

709
01:00:44,267 --> 01:00:47,236
Whenever the quantity of a man's
love undergoes any change...

710
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:49,638
the wife should consider
having lost him.

711
01:00:50,573 --> 01:00:52,734
I will have to turn a detective
for him now.

712
01:00:53,209 --> 01:00:54,938
Only then will he be
caught red-handed.

713
01:01:13,229 --> 01:01:14,890
Wipe yourself dry, sir.
- Thanks.

714
01:01:18,367 --> 01:01:20,198
How's my little doll?
- I'm fine.

715
01:01:23,906 --> 01:01:26,374
Don't worry at all.
No one will learn about it.

716
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:29,210
Here... keep this money.

717
01:01:29,579 --> 01:01:32,207
Go on... keep it. I told you that
no one will learn about it.

718
01:01:33,449 --> 01:01:35,815
Just take care of my doll.
I'll leave now. Bye!

719
01:01:36,018 --> 01:01:37,610
Bye, my child!
- Bye!

720
01:01:49,532 --> 01:01:52,228
Kaajal! Kaajal... That... I...
- There is no need to explain!

721
01:01:53,202 --> 01:01:56,660
I have seen everything myself! Since
when has all this been going on?

722
01:01:57,206 --> 01:01:59,174
Kaajal, be positive.
Whatever you're thinking...

723
01:01:59,408 --> 01:02:01,342
It's not that way, Kaajal!
- It is!

724
01:02:01,611 --> 01:02:03,772
You are just what I had thought
you were!

725
01:02:04,213 --> 01:02:06,181
Look, Kaajal, listen to me...
- Just, tell me this...

726
01:02:06,382 --> 01:02:08,350
because I don't know!
What does she have that I don't?

727
01:02:08,551 --> 01:02:09,950
Kaajal, you are not in your senses!

728
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:12,287
She is a married woman!
She has a child!

729
01:02:12,555 --> 01:02:15,183
So you are having an affair
with a married woman!

730
01:02:19,896 --> 01:02:21,864
According to you, a man and
a woman can have...

731
01:02:22,231 --> 01:02:24,199
just one relationship, isn't it?

732
01:02:24,567 --> 01:02:26,364
Come! Come on!

733
01:02:26,569 --> 01:02:30,198
Do you recognize him?
- Ram Gopal!

734
01:02:31,007 --> 01:02:32,975
Yes, it's Ram Gopal.

735
01:02:34,677 --> 01:02:37,202
He was the chief editor of our
newspaper since the last 8 years.

736
01:02:38,514 --> 01:02:40,209
But do you know why...

737
01:02:40,416 --> 01:02:42,816
he is trying to make these
funny paintings to run his home?

738
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:46,745
Because he lost both his legs
in an accident 6 months ago!

739
01:02:52,695 --> 01:02:55,664
I really tried to help him.

740
01:02:56,866 --> 01:03:00,165
However, he is a proud man.
He did not agree.

741
01:03:04,807 --> 01:03:06,570
Since they were unable
to pay the fees...

742
01:03:06,709 --> 01:03:08,677
his innocent daughter was
thrown out of school!

743
01:03:09,212 --> 01:03:10,873
These people were almost
on the streets!

744
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:15,239
Since then, I come here discreetly
to help them in some way! And you!

745
01:03:16,018 --> 01:03:18,680
You have crossed all the limits
of suspicion, Kaajal!

746
01:03:19,222 --> 01:03:23,352
I regret having married a woman
like you and ruining my life!

747
01:03:32,401 --> 01:03:35,199
"Everyone likes my face."

748
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:38,707
"Everyone falls in love with me."

749
01:03:39,909 --> 01:03:42,605
"Everyone likes my face."

750
01:03:43,246 --> 01:03:44,804
Go ahead and drink! Drink, my friend!

751
01:03:45,248 --> 01:03:47,546
Drink this too!
Another 4 doubles, please!

752
01:03:48,317 --> 01:03:50,877
You are not at fault here.
This is the result of...

753
01:03:51,254 --> 01:03:53,745
your wife's suspicion and an
award for your honesty!

754
01:03:55,524 --> 01:03:58,152
There is a limit to suspicion!
A limit to suspicion!

755
01:03:58,527 --> 01:04:01,155
You know, it's understood that
when a man goes out...

756
01:04:01,564 --> 01:04:04,533
he puts a lock on the door.
A person checks once...

757
01:04:04,901 --> 01:04:08,166
or twice but your wife...
she keeps sitting next to the lock!

758
01:04:09,772 --> 01:04:11,740
You are an honest man.
If I was in your place...

759
01:04:11,874 --> 01:04:13,842
I would have sneaked in from the back,
taken everything and...

760
01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:16,735
I would have changed the lock too!
No Entry!

761
01:04:20,283 --> 01:04:23,775
Let me tell you something.
What gives you...

762
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:27,451
all the grief in this world? A woman!

763
01:04:28,257 --> 01:04:31,192
And who gives you all the
happiness in this world?

764
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:35,189
A woman! Well, if one woman has
hurt you so much...

765
01:04:35,731 --> 01:04:37,858
let another woman give you
some happiness!

766
01:04:38,401 --> 01:04:41,199
"Love me, honey!"

767
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:43,538
"Kiss me, honey!"

768
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:45,431
"There's no one like me!"

769
01:04:45,641 --> 01:04:48,201
Listen to me.
One made you cry with grief.

770
01:04:48,511 --> 01:04:50,672
This one will make
you cry with happiness!

771
01:04:52,648 --> 01:04:55,674
Do you want her?
- No, my friend.

772
01:04:56,185 --> 01:04:58,881
No! Are you crazy?
Just look at her!

773
01:05:02,525 --> 01:05:05,323
I mean, not now.
- Not now, but you do mean...

774
01:05:05,528 --> 01:05:10,158
that you want her, isn't it? Good!
- Tomorrow, Kaajal...

775
01:05:10,933 --> 01:05:12,901
Kaajal is going to Ajmer tomorrow.

776
01:05:13,369 --> 01:05:15,166
She's going?
I'll send her in the morning.

777
01:05:15,471 --> 01:05:17,336
But where will I take her?

778
01:05:17,606 --> 01:05:20,575
Why do you have the guesthouse then?
The guesthouse is made just for her!

779
01:05:22,211 --> 01:05:23,178
"Just me!"

780
01:05:23,379 --> 01:05:26,678
"There's no one like me!
No, no, no, no! Just me!"

781
01:05:49,905 --> 01:05:51,702
Shall I leave?
- Yes, fine.

782
01:05:54,377 --> 01:05:55,469
Kaajal!

783
01:05:57,513 --> 01:05:59,640
I know that I'm not worthy of
your forgiveness.

784
01:06:00,549 --> 01:06:04,645
Please forgive me!
- No, no. It's all right.

785
01:06:05,388 --> 01:06:07,151
I've been with you since
so many years.

786
01:06:07,323 --> 01:06:09,154
But I've never understood you!

787
01:06:12,528 --> 01:06:14,826
I have never valued your love!
- Kaajal!

788
01:06:16,265 --> 01:06:19,666
But I've realised my mistake after
last night's incident.

789
01:06:20,536 --> 01:06:24,495
I've realised that you can never even
look at another woman!

790
01:06:27,410 --> 01:06:29,844
Please get up.
- I promise that...

791
01:06:30,379 --> 01:06:32,847
I'll never doubt you again. Never!

792
01:06:34,383 --> 01:06:38,717
I would have probably never doubted
you had I given you a child!

793
01:06:39,889 --> 01:06:42,357
But I don't know why
I have this fear...

794
01:06:43,225 --> 01:06:45,693
that your desire of fatherhood might
compel you to desert me!

795
01:06:50,399 --> 01:06:54,802
Kishan! I cannot live without my love!
I just cannot!

796
01:06:55,371 --> 01:06:57,464
Look... Look, you are going to Ajmer,
isn't it?

797
01:06:57,673 --> 01:06:59,641
Everything will be all right.
Be positive!

798
01:07:00,976 --> 01:07:03,604
On reaching there, I'll pray not
only for my child...

799
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:06,148
but for our relationship as well.

800
01:07:07,249 --> 01:07:09,513
I feel that someone has cast an evil
eye on our relationship.

801
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:21,158
Lakshmi!
- I've called her. Look Lakshmi...

802
01:07:21,363 --> 01:07:23,331
Sir should have his meals on time.

803
01:07:23,732 --> 01:07:26,166
I know that once I am gone, you'll
eat outside.

804
01:07:26,869 --> 01:07:29,167
And one falls ill after eating outside.

805
01:07:29,605 --> 01:07:32,836
And when I come back, I want to see you
just the way you are now. Ah, yes!

806
01:07:33,542 --> 01:07:36,170
If his head or hand hurt, massage them.

807
01:07:37,213 --> 01:07:39,681
There is nothing wrong in that.
Okay, go and work.

808
01:07:40,683 --> 01:07:44,676
Oh! My bag! Look,
I have kept some clothes...

809
01:07:45,387 --> 01:07:47,685
for Ram Gopal and his family.
Please give them to him... Please!

810
01:07:52,228 --> 01:07:53,786
Why... why are you taking my picture?

811
01:07:54,163 --> 01:07:56,461
Well, will I be able to stay
without you for 2 days?

812
01:07:56,899 --> 01:07:59,129
I'll just be back.
- You mean...

813
01:07:59,735 --> 01:08:01,566
you are going, isn't it?

814
01:08:01,737 --> 01:08:03,329
Of course!
But one must not say that.

815
01:08:03,506 --> 01:08:06,134
But it creates confusion!
- Okay.

816
01:08:06,675 --> 01:08:08,472
I'll be off.

817
01:08:19,922 --> 01:08:23,153
Yes, Kishan, shoot! What?
The programme is cancelled!

818
01:08:24,326 --> 01:08:27,159
Put your snap too, Pooja.

819
01:08:28,697 --> 01:08:33,657
Yes. What happened?
- I don't feel like cheating on her.

820
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:36,167
She loves me very much.

821
01:08:36,639 --> 01:08:38,664
That's because you're getting
such a big contract...

822
01:08:39,275 --> 01:08:41,334
for the first time. Look at me!
I have no fear!

823
01:08:41,744 --> 01:08:43,405
I'm used to it. I'm used to it, man!

824
01:08:43,612 --> 01:08:47,173
No, Prem, I don't feel right
going into a 'No Entry'!

825
01:08:48,217 --> 01:08:50,685
These shortcuts are not for me,
my friend.

826
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:54,118
I'll take the main road
as I usually do.

827
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:57,787
Well, brother, one must never
let a good opportunity pass!

828
01:08:58,327 --> 01:09:00,795
Isn't that right, Pooja?
- Yes, brother, he's absolutely right!

829
01:09:01,330 --> 01:09:03,457
Did you hear that? And listen...

830
01:09:04,166 --> 01:09:05,633
That party must be reaching
at any minute.

831
01:09:05,801 --> 01:09:07,792
Oh my God!
- Why are you scared?

832
01:09:08,671 --> 01:09:11,469
Meet her with full confidence!
And impress her so much...

833
01:09:12,875 --> 01:09:14,604
that whenever she does business...
she does it only with you!

834
01:09:14,777 --> 01:09:17,143
Hello! Prem, look...
- I'm going to South Africa today.

835
01:09:22,184 --> 01:09:24,652
Look now, don't waste
my hundred thousand.

836
01:09:25,487 --> 01:09:27,318
One hundred thousand!
- Yes!

837
01:09:28,591 --> 01:09:31,151
But there's a guarantee that
you'll feel...

838
01:09:31,427 --> 01:09:33,156
that the job was worth one million!

839
01:09:33,362 --> 01:09:35,330
And I'm telling you with
full experience that...

840
01:09:35,497 --> 01:09:37,397
this party is fantastic!
I'll hang up now.

841
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:27,210
Sorry, I'm a bit late.

842
01:10:29,451 --> 01:10:31,544
Look... I was saying. Bobby...

843
01:10:33,455 --> 01:10:36,219
Can we have this programme
some other day?

844
01:10:40,262 --> 01:10:44,221
You sat down!
- I've kept 100 people waiting for you!

845
01:10:44,667 --> 01:10:46,601
And you are trying to chase
me from here!

846
01:10:48,070 --> 01:10:50,402
The money that Prem had given you...
I'm not asking you to return it.

847
01:10:51,807 --> 01:10:54,571
What do you think?
I've come to you for the 25,000?

848
01:10:55,477 --> 01:10:57,502
25,000.
He told me it's a hundred thousand!

849
01:10:58,547 --> 01:11:02,677
25,000 rupees! I can refuse
it 2,500 times for you!

850
01:11:03,585 --> 01:11:07,351
Because it's not money but love
that's between us!

851
01:11:08,223 --> 01:11:11,556
It's a matter of the heart!
It's a secret!

852
01:11:12,227 --> 01:11:15,196
A secret!
Let the secret remain a secret!

853
01:11:15,664 --> 01:11:17,689
Please... Please, go away from here.

854
01:11:21,236 --> 01:11:24,694
Where is the washroom?
- Washroom? ...There.

855
01:11:27,776 --> 01:11:30,870
Listen to me.
Come out fast, please.

856
01:11:31,246 --> 01:11:32,975
5 minutes.
- Fast! Fast!

857
01:11:38,787 --> 01:11:42,883
Oops! I forgot my ticket at home!
Driver, take the car home.

858
01:12:31,306 --> 01:12:34,207
"Why are you going having stolen
my heart?"

859
01:12:35,577 --> 01:12:38,705
"What makes you trouble me like this?"

860
01:12:39,581 --> 01:12:42,709
"Why are you going having stolen
my heart?"

861
01:12:43,752 --> 01:12:46,721
"What makes you trouble me like this?"

862
01:12:47,823 --> 01:12:51,224
"I've been waiting for you
since so long."

863
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:55,496
"Why do you refuse to come close?"

864
01:13:04,573 --> 01:13:08,168
Lakshmi! Where is your master?
- He's gone to the guesthouse.

865
01:13:23,225 --> 01:13:26,683
"Both of us are full of desire!"

866
01:13:27,229 --> 01:13:30,721
"This distance makes us
grow impatient!"

867
01:13:34,536 --> 01:13:36,731
"O' my darling!"

868
01:13:39,741 --> 01:13:44,201
"Our breaths are afire!"

869
01:13:46,915 --> 01:13:48,212
"Sweetheart..."

870
01:13:52,254 --> 01:13:55,155
"The surroundings are weaving magic!"

871
01:13:56,191 --> 01:13:59,319
"Both of us are wanton!"

872
01:14:00,195 --> 01:14:03,494
"I'm casting my spell over you!"

873
01:14:04,433 --> 01:14:07,664
"I've been waiting for you
since so long."

874
01:14:08,537 --> 01:14:11,665
"Why do you refuse to come close?"

875
01:14:12,708 --> 01:14:15,677
"Why are you going having stolen my
heart?"

876
01:14:16,745 --> 01:14:20,181
"What makes you trouble me like this?"

877
01:14:59,721 --> 01:15:01,279
Why did you take so long
to open the door?

878
01:15:01,456 --> 01:15:05,654
I was in the bathroom...
I'm not feeling well.

879
01:15:05,894 --> 01:15:07,486
That is why I couldn't hear the bell.

880
01:15:13,402 --> 01:15:16,496
But what are you doing here?
- What am I doing here? Yes...

881
01:15:16,738 --> 01:15:18,831
I've heard that there's going
to be an income-tax raid.

882
01:15:19,207 --> 01:15:21,175
That's why I had come here to
hide the files...

883
01:15:21,343 --> 01:15:23,174
in the bathroom.
- In the bathroom?

884
01:15:24,513 --> 01:15:26,344
They'll be wet in there!

885
01:15:27,215 --> 01:15:30,184
Don't worry!
I know what should be hidden where!

886
01:15:31,219 --> 01:15:33,187
But, you're here!
- I just forgot my ticket.

887
01:15:33,755 --> 01:15:35,723
Then I remembered that
you also forgot...

888
01:15:36,224 --> 01:15:38,192
to give me money to make an offering.

889
01:15:40,429 --> 01:15:43,364
Well! I'm also a little... forgetful!

890
01:15:46,902 --> 01:15:48,699
Why are your hands trembling so much?

891
01:15:49,905 --> 01:15:53,466
Well... I'm not feeling well.
I'm feeling a bit cold too!

892
01:15:54,643 --> 01:15:58,135
That's strange! Where is Sunny?
- Sunny!

893
01:15:58,347 --> 01:16:00,144
Sunny has gone to get my medicines.

894
01:16:00,315 --> 01:16:02,146
Better move or you will
miss the flight.

895
01:16:02,317 --> 01:16:04,148
C'mon, let's go.

896
01:16:16,665 --> 01:16:20,157
A 'ladies' sandal?
- Is it a lady's sandal?

897
01:16:21,436 --> 01:16:24,166
Can't you see?
- It is a ladies sandal.

898
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:27,174
Whose is it?
- Must be of some lady.

899
01:16:27,609 --> 01:16:31,170
I know that but whose is it?
- That... That...

900
01:16:31,747 --> 01:16:34,181
We'll have to ask Sunny.
I'll ask him.

901
01:16:34,449 --> 01:16:36,349
You must leave, darling.
Or you'll miss the flight!

902
01:16:45,594 --> 01:16:47,186
This jacket?

903
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:51,694
Jacket...?
It surely belongs to Sunny.

904
01:16:52,701 --> 01:16:54,328
It's a ladies jacket.

905
01:16:54,503 --> 01:16:56,869
Ladies... it can't belong
to Sunny then.

906
01:16:57,706 --> 01:17:00,140
Then who could it belong to?
- That...

907
01:17:00,909 --> 01:17:02,638
We'll have to ask Sunny that as well!

908
01:17:10,485 --> 01:17:13,147
You doubt me, isn't it?
You are doubting me again!

909
01:17:14,856 --> 01:17:16,517
Does this house belong to me? Yes,
it is.

910
01:17:16,692 --> 01:17:19,490
I mean, it belongs to us. But...
but it's Sunny who stays here!

911
01:17:19,928 --> 01:17:22,158
What Sunny does here...
why does he keep a ladies jacket?

912
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:24,161
How am I supposed to know that?
- I was just asking.

913
01:17:24,366 --> 01:17:26,834
I did not doubt you.
- But I'm the one who is hurt!

914
01:17:27,736 --> 01:17:29,363
It is my heart that is burning!

915
01:17:29,538 --> 01:17:31,665
I do feel that you doubt me!

916
01:17:34,609 --> 01:17:37,305
Okay, I'll leave or
I'll miss the flight.

917
01:17:37,913 --> 01:17:39,847
Okay, leave.

918
01:17:52,227 --> 01:17:53,785
Cockroach!

919
01:18:08,543 --> 01:18:11,137
Who is she?
- She is... she is...

920
01:18:11,646 --> 01:18:15,138
Yes, tell me. Or will I have to ask
Sunny about this!

921
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:19,609
Sunny! Kaajal, what I was saying...
- What were you saying?

922
01:18:20,188 --> 01:18:23,157
Is she the same... Income tax file?

923
01:18:26,661 --> 01:18:30,654
I had just begun trusting you, Kishan.
And as soon as I left...

924
01:18:33,401 --> 01:18:35,164
You cheated on me in such a big way!

925
01:18:35,504 --> 01:18:37,665
I haven't cheated on you.
- So, why don't you tell me?

926
01:18:38,206 --> 01:18:42,165
Who is she? What is she doing here?
- What is this, brother? You just...

927
01:19:12,908 --> 01:19:18,141
Idiot! And duffer! You're in trouble!
- In trouble?

928
01:19:19,214 --> 01:19:21,876
I told you so many times not to
hide anything from Kaajal.

929
01:19:23,652 --> 01:19:25,142
What have I hidden?
- What have you hidden?

930
01:19:25,353 --> 01:19:28,151
Tell her the truth now at least!
She doubts me!

931
01:19:29,958 --> 01:19:32,324
What do I tell her?
- What will you tell her? I'll tell her.

932
01:19:32,527 --> 01:19:35,690
Kaajal, this is Bobby... Sunny's wife.

933
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:51,169
Wife! When did you get married, Sunny?
- Uh... just now.

934
01:19:52,214 --> 01:19:55,513
What do you mean by 'just now'?
- I mean... just now...

935
01:19:56,384 --> 01:19:59,182
About a week ago...
A week... Just a week back.

936
01:20:01,389 --> 01:20:03,357
She's not wearing a 'mangalsutra'!
- How can she?

937
01:20:03,959 --> 01:20:05,688
Why can't she?

938
01:20:06,695 --> 01:20:08,526
Bobby... Bobby...

939
01:20:08,697 --> 01:20:10,528
Bobby is Christian, you see.
- Yes.

940
01:20:11,233 --> 01:20:14,600
They wear a ring.
- They wear rings, you know!

941
01:20:14,769 --> 01:20:15,861
Christianity...

942
01:20:16,238 --> 01:20:18,206
But why did you hide this from me?

943
01:20:20,609 --> 01:20:22,577
Ask him. Tell her, brother!

944
01:20:23,612 --> 01:20:26,706
Actually, Bobby's brother is
an underworld don.

945
01:20:27,749 --> 01:20:30,217
He was against their love.
And they got married.

946
01:20:30,585 --> 01:20:32,553
Now he's roaming around openly
with a knife!

947
01:20:32,754 --> 01:20:34,551
He says that he wants to kill
his brother-in-law...

948
01:20:34,723 --> 01:20:36,554
and make his sister a widow!

949
01:20:40,495 --> 01:20:44,226
You've locked up such a pretty and
innocent girl since so many days!

950
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,735
You both fell in love and got married.
You've not committed a sin...

951
01:20:48,937 --> 01:20:51,235
to get so scared! Who is her brother?
I'll talk to him!

952
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:54,508
Kaajal... why will you take the trouble?

953
01:20:54,676 --> 01:20:56,644
I will... I will take care of it.
- Kishan, I...

954
01:20:56,878 --> 01:21:00,177
Be positive! You must leave or you'll
miss the flight.

955
01:21:00,382 --> 01:21:02,179
Ah, yes! Bye!

956
01:21:02,751 --> 01:21:04,685
Call me as soon as you land!

957
01:21:06,688 --> 01:21:08,656
You saved me today!

958
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:16,690
Hadn't I told you not to make a sound?
And you screamed!?

959
01:21:17,933 --> 01:21:19,867
I had forbidden you even to peep
from the bathroom!

960
01:21:20,235 --> 01:21:22,703
And you came right out!
- There was a cockroach in the bathroom.

961
01:21:22,938 --> 01:21:25,532
Would it have eaten you?
- I got scared.

962
01:21:26,441 --> 01:21:28,204
You got scared!

963
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:32,540
If my wife's suspicions had been
confirmed today, you know...

964
01:21:33,615 --> 01:21:35,583
I would have ended up spending
the rest of my life...

965
01:21:35,784 --> 01:21:37,547
in terror in my own house!

966
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:42,722
Why are you scared now?
She's gone, isn't it? You're saved!

967
01:21:46,428 --> 01:21:48,555
Please! Please! Go from here.

968
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:01,170
What happened, Sunny?
- I had thought you were an upright man.

969
01:22:01,476 --> 01:22:04,673
I am an upright man, my friend!
- Bye, handsome!

970
01:22:07,716 --> 01:22:09,684
Yes! I can see it!

971
01:22:10,552 --> 01:22:12,679
If you hadn't done so many favours
for me I would have printed...

972
01:22:12,887 --> 01:22:15,685
such a big picture of yours
in the newspaper.

973
01:22:16,224 --> 01:22:19,352
Sunny, I haven't done anything.
I really haven't done anything.

974
01:22:19,894 --> 01:22:21,361
Prem is responsible for all this!

975
01:22:26,801 --> 01:22:28,701
But why did you have to call her
my wife in front of Kaajal?

976
01:22:28,903 --> 01:22:30,200
Should I have called her
my wife instead?

977
01:22:30,338 --> 01:22:33,205
You could have called her my girlfriend.
So that, tomorrow...

978
01:22:34,409 --> 01:22:36,377
I could at least say that she left me,
ran away or died!

979
01:22:36,745 --> 01:22:38,713
You called her my wife!

980
01:22:39,748 --> 01:22:41,716
How do I get rid of my wife now?

981
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:44,548
What if Sanjana learns about this
so-called wife?

982
01:22:44,753 --> 01:22:46,721
She won't come to know, Sunny.
Whatever has happened...

983
01:22:46,921 --> 01:22:50,220
has happened within these 4 walls!
Just between 4 people!

984
01:22:51,259 --> 01:22:54,160
And I made her your wife. Therefore,
I'll only get the two of you divorced!

985
01:22:55,830 --> 01:22:58,822
I mean, I'd like to see my look-alike.
What is his name? Sh... Sh...

986
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,497
Shekhar.
- Yes, Shekhar. Mr. Shekhar...

987
01:23:00,668 --> 01:23:02,499
Just come here for a minute,
Sweety. Well...

988
01:23:02,871 --> 01:23:06,170
Ms. Nisha, I wanted to ask you something.
Does he really...

989
01:23:06,741 --> 01:23:10,177
Does he really look like me?
- Absolutely! He looks just like you.

990
01:23:10,478 --> 01:23:13,504
Then it's very important to meet him.
I'll call him.

991
01:23:13,915 --> 01:23:15,678
He's gone to office

992
01:23:16,217 --> 01:23:19,186
Okay... how do you know that
he's gone to office?

993
01:23:21,456 --> 01:23:25,187
He's lying to both his wives and
you're enjoying it!

994
01:23:27,595 --> 01:23:32,532
You can stop me from lying.
How can I ask Govinda not to lie?

995
01:23:33,234 --> 01:23:35,361
Why do you have to whistle
when he is lying?

996
01:23:36,738 --> 01:23:41,698
You intend getting married twice!
Lying is no sin for you! Shut up!

997
01:23:43,344 --> 01:23:45,710
That's why you're enjoying so much
and whistling so loudly!

998
01:23:46,247 --> 01:23:48,215
Go out and fight!
- Shut up!

999
01:23:48,483 --> 01:23:51,213
Go and lie! Keep doing that!
Marry twice! Whistle!

1000
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:55,822
We are finished from today!
- But... have you gone crazy?

1001
01:23:56,558 --> 01:23:58,651
For such a small thing, you...
- Is this a small for you?

1002
01:23:59,594 --> 01:24:04,497
Listen to me! Sanjana... Sanjana...
I promise that from today...

1003
01:24:04,899 --> 01:24:06,833
I'll never enjoy such scenes!

1004
01:24:08,870 --> 01:24:11,634
I'll never watch such films!
Please forgive me.

1005
01:24:13,708 --> 01:24:14,504
On one condition!

1006
01:24:15,577 --> 01:24:17,511
You will have to ask my father for
my hand in marriage.

1007
01:24:18,279 --> 01:24:20,679
Just the hand!
I want the entire Sanjana!

1008
01:24:22,217 --> 01:24:23,184
Dog!

1009
01:24:25,687 --> 01:24:28,349
Okay... fine.
- Kaajal, ever since you're back...

1010
01:24:28,723 --> 01:24:30,850
from Ajmer you're just involved in this
'best couple' function!

1011
01:24:31,359 --> 01:24:33,327
What do I do? The responsibility
is entirely on me!

1012
01:24:34,229 --> 01:24:36,197
I've already found 3 couples.
However, I can't understand...

1013
01:24:36,397 --> 01:24:40,857
what to do about the 4th! Ah, yes!
How about our Sunny and Bobby?

1014
01:24:41,402 --> 01:24:45,202
They will be very good! No, no!
How can both of them come together?

1015
01:24:45,406 --> 01:24:46,532
Why?

1016
01:24:47,408 --> 01:24:49,706
Well...
- You think so much before speaking...

1017
01:24:50,245 --> 01:24:51,872
that unwittingly I start
doubting you!

1018
01:24:52,247 --> 01:24:55,148
Be positive, darling! Actually...
Actually, both had a fight.

1019
01:24:55,617 --> 01:24:57,642
And Bobby has gone to her
brother's place.

1020
01:24:58,186 --> 01:24:59,813
It's not even been 4 days since
they're married...

1021
01:25:00,188 --> 01:25:01,177
and Sunny has already
started fighting!

1022
01:25:01,356 --> 01:25:05,315
The poor girl is so nice!
- We know how nice she really is!

1023
01:25:05,593 --> 01:25:06,560
What?

1024
01:25:06,728 --> 01:25:09,162
I mean, we both know what a nice girl
she is, isn't it?

1025
01:25:09,531 --> 01:25:11,499
But he feels she is trouble!
He won't go!

1026
01:25:11,699 --> 01:25:13,496
All right! I'll call him then.

1027
01:25:15,737 --> 01:25:20,174
Listen! Look... He's already
very unhappy. He'll be tensed too!

1028
01:25:20,542 --> 01:25:23,170
I'll talk to him. I'll try...
- No trying!

1029
01:25:23,478 --> 01:25:26,174
Both should come for the function Or
I'll reach Bobby's place!

1030
01:25:26,381 --> 01:25:28,542
What?
- Yes!

1031
01:25:30,552 --> 01:25:33,521
Sir! Hi!
Good that you called me here.

1032
01:25:34,589 --> 01:25:37,353
Sunny, we hold a 'best couple'
competition every year.

1033
01:25:37,792 --> 01:25:42,195
This year, Kaajal has registered
yours and Bobby's name.

1034
01:25:44,966 --> 01:25:46,763
You and Bobby will have to pretend...
