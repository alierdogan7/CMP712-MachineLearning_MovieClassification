1
00:00:02,114 --> 00:00:03,365
<i>So here's
what you missed on Glee:</i>

2
00:00:03,432 --> 00:00:04,599
<i>Tina dumped Artie
for Mike Chang.</i>

3
00:00:07,436 --> 00:00:08,987
<i>in the shower.
And we'd like to talk
to you about Glee Club.</i>

4
00:00:09,071 --> 00:00:09,871
<i>Finn thought Kurt was trying
to look at him in the shower,</i>

5
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:11,373
<i>so he called him a name</i>

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,074
<i>which totally got him
chewed out by Kurt's dad.</i>

7
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:14,493
<i>Maybe everyone should
just start taking baths.</i>

8
00:00:14,577 --> 00:00:15,377
<i>And that's what you missed
on Glee!</i>

9
00:00:18,047 --> 00:00:18,914
(bell ringing)

10
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,552
All right, let's, uh,
let's gather round.

11
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:25,887
Sorry I'm late, guys.

12
00:00:25,955 --> 00:00:27,121
I was with Principal Figgins.

13
00:00:28,674 --> 00:00:31,259
Bad news, guys.
Puckerman's in Juvvie.

14
00:00:31,327 --> 00:00:33,228
It really was just
a matter of time.

15
00:00:33,295 --> 00:00:34,312
What did he do?

16
00:00:34,397 --> 00:00:35,797
He drove his mom's Volvo through

17
00:00:35,865 --> 00:00:37,065
the front of
a convenience store,

18
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:38,800
and drove off with the ATM.

19
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:40,151
(laughter)

20
00:00:40,236 --> 00:00:41,486
A-A-And when is he getting out?

21
00:00:41,571 --> 00:00:42,771
Unknown.

22
00:00:42,822 --> 00:00:44,239
He might be the mbest
person on this planet,

23
00:00:44,306 --> 00:00:45,106
and that's
coming from me.

24
00:00:45,157 --> 00:00:47,225
Guys! Let's have some sympathy.

25
00:00:47,293 --> 00:00:48,860
For a guy who put his
needs before the team's?

26
00:00:48,945 --> 00:00:50,946
We need his voice, and his
bad-boy stage presence.

27
00:00:50,997 --> 00:00:53,665
We can't look at this
as, as a crisis.

28
00:00:53,749 --> 00:00:55,033
It's an opportunity.

29
00:00:55,117 --> 00:00:56,484
For what?

30
00:00:56,552 --> 00:00:57,986
Further embarrassment
and humiliation?

31
00:00:58,037 --> 00:01:02,090
For welcoming our new member...
Sam Evans!

32
00:01:02,157 --> 00:01:04,426
There he is.
How's it going?

33
00:01:04,493 --> 00:01:05,994
Hey, everybody.
I'm Sam.

34
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:08,930
Sam... I am.

35
00:01:08,998 --> 00:01:10,465
And I don't like
green eggs and ham.

36
00:01:10,516 --> 00:01:13,501
Oh, wow.
He has no game.

37
00:01:13,553 --> 00:01:15,220
Okay! This is
gonna be great.

38
00:01:15,304 --> 00:01:16,688
You're not going to
regret joining, Sam.

39
00:01:16,772 --> 00:01:17,722
Oh, good.

40
00:01:17,807 --> 00:01:19,007
Sam, you sit right here.

41
00:01:19,058 --> 00:01:20,358
WILL: All right!
Question for the group.

42
00:01:20,443 --> 00:01:22,861
What's a duet?

43
00:01:22,945 --> 00:01:24,613
A blanket.

44
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,365
A duet is when two voices
join to become one.

45
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,185
WILL: Great duets are like
a great marriage.

46
00:01:31,237 --> 00:01:32,487
The singers complement
each other,

47
00:01:32,538 --> 00:01:33,855
push each other to be better.

48
00:01:33,906 --> 00:01:35,240
Now, some people...

49
00:01:35,324 --> 00:01:37,459
Psst! He's on team gay.

50
00:01:37,526 --> 00:01:39,127
No straight boy
dyes his hair

51
00:01:39,194 --> 00:01:41,580
to look like Linda
Evangelista circa 1993.

52
00:01:41,647 --> 00:01:43,999
You're crazy,
circa 2010.

53
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,199
WILL:
And that is what

54
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:46,885
duets are all about.

55
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:50,038
So, this week I want you
to pair up and sing a duet.

56
00:01:50,089 --> 00:01:52,140
And since you guys all
seemed to love our little

57
00:01:52,207 --> 00:01:56,711
"Defying Gravity" diva-off,
I'm making this a competition.

58
00:01:56,762 --> 00:01:58,313
What's the winner get?

59
00:01:58,381 --> 00:02:00,381
Dinner for two, on me...

60
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:02,400
at Breadstix.

61
00:02:02,485 --> 00:02:03,885
(all gasping)
Breadstix!

62
00:02:03,936 --> 00:02:08,740
(everyone
chattering excitedly)

63
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:10,108
Who you gonna
sing with, Kurt?

64
00:02:15,948 --> 00:02:17,616

66
00:02:18,684 --> 00:02:20,368
(bell ringing)

67
00:02:22,455 --> 00:02:24,255
Hi. I'm Kurt Hummel.

68
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,707
Hey.

69
00:02:25,758 --> 00:02:27,759
I just wanted to personally
welcome you to the glee club.

70
00:02:27,843 --> 00:02:30,045
Thanks.

71
00:02:30,096 --> 00:02:31,579
Just tell me.

72
00:02:33,749 --> 00:02:35,850
Look... maybe at
your old school,

73
00:02:35,918 --> 00:02:37,469
you could get away
with the whole

74
00:02:37,553 --> 00:02:39,354
"I just stayed in the sun
all summer" excuse,

75
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:41,690
but I have three gifts:
my voice,

76
00:02:41,757 --> 00:02:43,642
my ability to spot trends
in men's fashion,

77
00:02:43,726 --> 00:02:46,695
and my ability to know when
it comes from a bottle.

78
00:02:46,762 --> 00:02:48,330
I don't dye my hair, dude.

79
00:02:48,397 --> 00:02:49,230
Yes, you do.

80
00:02:49,281 --> 00:02:50,264
But it's just between friends.

81
00:02:50,316 --> 00:02:51,800
That's not natural.

82
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:53,268
I'm gonna... go...

83
00:02:53,336 --> 00:02:55,987
'cause you're kinda
freaking me out.

84
00:02:56,072 --> 00:02:57,455
Wait, wait.

85
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,990
Maybe my instincts
were a little off.

86
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:00,608
Let me make it up to you.

87
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,377
Team up with me for
the duet competition.

88
00:03:02,444 --> 00:03:03,795
Listen, unless you
team up with Rachel,

89
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,463
I am your best
bet at winning.

90
00:03:05,548 --> 00:03:07,966
Aren't duets supposed to be
between, like, a girl and a guy?

91
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,418
Well, Gene Kelly and Donald
O'Connor would protest.

92
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:11,553
"Make'em Laugh"?

93
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,721
Sorry.

94
00:03:12,788 --> 00:03:14,589
<i>Singin' in the Rain.
1952.</i>

95
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,391
Nothing. Okay, maybe
you are straight.

96
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,309
What?
Nothing. Listen, rent it.

97
00:03:18,394 --> 00:03:20,011
and then look up the menu
for Breadstix online,

98
00:03:20,096 --> 00:03:21,513
and call me, because
we are gonna win this.

99
00:03:21,597 --> 00:03:23,982
(bell ringing)

100
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:34,609
BRITTANY:
I love your sweet lady kisses.

101
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,244
Mm-hmm.

102
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:38,863
It's a nice break from
all that scissoring.

103
00:03:38,948 --> 00:03:40,865
We should do a
duet together.

104
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,702
We should sing Melissa
Ethridge's "Come To My Window."

105
00:03:43,786 --> 00:03:45,120
First of all?

106
00:03:45,171 --> 00:03:46,554
There's a lot of
talking going on,

107
00:03:46,622 --> 00:03:48,006
and I wants ta
get my mack on.

108
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,958
Well... I don't know,
I just... I think we just...

109
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:51,492
Okay, second of all?

110
00:03:51,544 --> 00:03:53,962
I'm not making out with you
because I'm in love with you

111
00:03:54,013 --> 00:03:55,847
and want to sing about
making lady babies.

112
00:03:55,915 --> 00:03:58,016
I'm only here because Puck's
been in the slammer

113
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,701
for about 12 hours now,
and I'm like a lizard.

114
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:02,554
I need something warm beneath
me, or I can't digest my food.

115
00:04:02,638 --> 00:04:05,407
But who are you going
to sing a duet with?

116
00:04:05,474 --> 00:04:06,941
(bell ringing)

117
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:08,676
Why would I want to do
a duet with you?

118
00:04:08,728 --> 00:04:09,611
We can't stand each other.

119
00:04:09,678 --> 00:04:10,729
Look, Wheezy, I realize

120
00:04:10,813 --> 00:04:12,346
I've tried to punch you
a couple times,

121
00:04:12,398 --> 00:04:13,615
and sometimes, when
you're not looking,

122
00:04:13,682 --> 00:04:15,366
I puweird things
in your food.

123
00:04:15,451 --> 00:04:17,068
But it's a new year,
and you and I

124
00:04:17,153 --> 00:04:18,319
are the best singers
at this school.

125
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,571
I don't get what
the big deal is,

126
00:04:19,655 --> 00:04:21,322
it's just a free trip
to Breadstix.

127
00:04:21,373 --> 00:04:24,793
<i>Um, I'm sorry, have you
been to Breadstix?</i>

128
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,663
They are legally forbidden to
stop bringing you breadsticks.

129
00:04:28,714 --> 00:04:30,531
One time I brought
a wheelbarrow,

130
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,633
and when the mager tried

131
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,068
to stop me from
filling it up,

132
00:04:33,135 --> 00:04:34,319
I calleded the corporae
office and got her fired.

133
00:04:34,403 --> 00:04:36,638
(sighs)

134
00:04:36,705 --> 00:04:39,474
Well, I guess our voices
do sorta go together.

135
00:04:39,525 --> 00:04:40,909
Mm-hmm, that's right, girl!

136
00:04:40,976 --> 00:04:42,961
So if we do a duet
together, we will be

137
00:04:43,028 --> 00:04:45,363
the undisputed top
bitches at this school.

138
00:04:47,616 --> 00:04:49,467
(bell ringing)

139
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,752
You can't do this to him.

140
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:51,652
You're over-reacting.

141
00:04:51,704 --> 00:04:53,088
If he sings with you,

142
00:04:53,155 --> 00:04:54,506
you're painting a
bull's-eye on his back.

143
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,708
Once again, your closeted
homophobia seeps to the surface

144
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:58,843
like the contents of
a cracked cesspool.

145
00:04:58,928 --> 00:05:00,361
Don't give me that.

146
00:05:00,429 --> 00:05:02,797
Look, I know I shouldn't have
used that word in your basement,

147
00:05:02,848 --> 00:05:04,332
but it's not like
you were innocent.

148
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,217
I really like you, Kurt.

149
00:05:06,302 --> 00:05:07,835
But the fact
of the matter is,

150
00:05:07,887 --> 00:05:09,804
the way you were all
over me last year?

151
00:05:09,855 --> 00:05:12,524
if I did that to a girl, she'd
take out a restraining order.

152
00:05:12,608 --> 00:05:15,510
You have issues with me
being gay, I get it.

153
00:05:15,561 --> 00:05:16,728
No, actually, I don't.

154
00:05:16,812 --> 00:05:18,179
I have issues with
the fact that

155
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:23,368
you don't understand
that no means no.

156
00:05:23,452 --> 00:05:24,819
I just want to
sing with him.

157
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:29,824
Then you don't give
a damn about any of us.

158
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:33,361
If he sings with you,
I guarantee, within a week,

159
00:05:33,412 --> 00:05:35,330
he'll take so much crap,

160
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:37,165
he'll have to quit Glee Club.

161
00:05:38,584 --> 00:05:39,751
Your call, dude.

192
00:07:27,793 --> 00:07:28,643
I know.

193
00:07:32,581 --> 00:07:34,832
Wow. Don't be sad.

194
00:07:34,917 --> 00:07:37,001
I mean, Breadstix has these
vegan meatballs, they're...

195
00:07:37,086 --> 00:07:38,086
they're okay.

196
00:07:38,153 --> 00:07:39,671
I'm not really a nice person.

197
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,924
I'm selfish.

198
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:48,880
The fact is, is I'm
only really generous

199
00:07:48,964 --> 00:07:50,548
if there's something
in it for me.

200
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:52,467
Yeah, but I
still like you.

201
00:07:52,518 --> 00:07:56,638
But you, you're so...
kind, a-and open.

202
00:07:58,841 --> 00:08:01,676
Well, it's made me
want to be a better person.

203
00:08:05,514 --> 00:08:06,898
We have to throw
the competition.

204
00:08:06,982 --> 00:08:08,750
I love Breadstix.

205
00:08:08,817 --> 00:08:11,018
No, i-i-if we wanna
win at Nationals,

206
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,987
then Sam has to
win this contest.

207
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,990
Okay? He has to feel
like he belongs and,

208
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,325
and the team has
to believe in him.

209
00:08:17,376 --> 00:08:20,795
Wow, Rachel, I never
seen you like this.

210
00:08:20,863 --> 00:08:22,063
I'm kind of impressed.

211
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:24,865
Well, like I said...

212
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:26,584
you inspired me.

213
00:08:30,706 --> 00:08:32,056
But technically,
you're doing this

214
00:08:32,141 --> 00:08:33,775
because it'll help
us win Nationals,

215
00:08:33,842 --> 00:08:36,060
which means there's
something in it for you,

216
00:08:36,145 --> 00:08:38,563
so it doesn't really count
as you doing something nice.

217
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,515
Okay, so I'm just gonna
ignore what you just said

218
00:08:40,566 --> 00:08:42,734
repeat what I said before:
we just have to find a way

219
00:08:42,818 --> 00:08:44,152
for me to lose
a singing competition

220
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,570
so that the new kid
sticks around.

221
00:08:45,654 --> 00:08:46,604
Right.

222
00:08:50,658 --> 00:08:52,826
I don't want to do it.
We're duet partners--
you have to sing!

223
00:08:52,877 --> 00:08:54,261
<i>I don't even know
if I can sing.</i>

224
00:08:54,328 --> 00:08:56,496
Everyo knows I'm here
to do one thing: dance.

225
00:08:56,547 --> 00:08:58,298
You sing and I'll
dance around you;
you'll be fine.
No, no.

226
00:08:58,349 --> 00:09:00,017
We're singing together.

227
00:09:00,101 --> 00:09:01,501
We are gonna win that
dinner at Breadstix,

228
00:09:01,552 --> 00:09:03,020
and then we can finally
have a normal night out.

229
00:09:04,222 --> 00:09:05,722
Normal? What do you mean?

230
00:09:05,807 --> 00:09:07,357
We went out last night.

231
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:09,309
For dim sum.
With your mom.

232
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,062
All we ever do is get
dim sum with your mom!

233
00:09:12,146 --> 00:09:13,230
Here we go.

234
00:09:15,516 --> 00:09:16,667
Hi.

235
00:09:16,734 --> 00:09:19,303
So, I just want
you to know

236
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,570
I'm really into you.

237
00:09:22,457 --> 00:09:23,657
Okay.

238
00:09:23,725 --> 00:09:25,075
Sorry, I'm...

239
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,843
just a little confused.

240
00:09:26,928 --> 00:09:29,346
You've never even made
eye contact with me.

241
00:09:29,414 --> 00:09:32,299
I know. For a while
I thought you were a robot.

242
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,134
<i>TINA:
I'm not saying that</i>

243
00:09:34,185 --> 00:09:35,335
steamed pork knuckles
aren't delicious.

244
00:09:35,403 --> 00:09:37,054
I'm just saying
that at Breadstix

245
00:09:37,138 --> 00:09:38,689
they have bottomless
salad bowls,

246
00:09:38,773 --> 00:09:41,308
they refill your salad
until you leave or pass out.

247
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:43,143
You can get salad
at dim sum.

248
00:09:43,194 --> 00:09:44,511
My mom got salad
last night.

249
00:09:44,562 --> 00:09:45,862
There were chicken feet in it.

250
00:09:45,947 --> 00:09:48,365
It was a chicken
feet salad.

251
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:50,283
All I want is
a normal salad

252
00:09:50,351 --> 00:09:52,352
that doesn't have
chicken feet in it!

253
00:09:52,403 --> 00:09:54,287
So, let me get this straight.

254
00:09:54,355 --> 00:09:57,074
You want to be my girlfriend

255
00:09:57,158 --> 00:10:00,877
because... you like
the idea of...

256
00:10:02,213 --> 00:10:03,830
...wheeling me around?

257
00:10:03,881 --> 00:10:07,134
I just really want
to get you in a stroller.

258
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:08,385
<i>MIKE:
You're not listening to me.</i>

259
00:10:08,453 --> 00:10:09,970
You don't care
about my needs!

260
00:10:10,037 --> 00:10:11,221
Shh!

261
00:10:11,305 --> 00:10:13,140
We're fighting a lot.

262
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:16,710
We should go to
Asian couples therapy.

263
00:10:16,761 --> 00:10:19,980
Why does the couples therapy
have to be Asian?

264
00:10:20,048 --> 00:10:22,215
So, I get to tell
everybody that we're dating?

265
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:23,216
Yes.

266
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:25,218
And I get a duet partner.

267
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:35,395
I don't see the big deal.

268
00:10:35,446 --> 00:10:37,247
He e-mailed me, like,
60 MP3's of him singing,

269
00:10:37,331 --> 00:10:39,166
and I thought it was Faith Hill.

270
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:40,784
The kid's good.

271
00:10:40,868 --> 00:10:43,069
Look, this isn't about
how good Kurt is.

272
00:10:45,506 --> 00:10:47,340
Being in Glee Club is like...

273
00:10:47,408 --> 00:10:49,426
it's like walking down
the double yellow lines

274
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,727
of a highway.

275
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:52,846
If you get just
a little off course

276
00:10:52,913 --> 00:10:54,264
you're gonna get crushed.

277
00:10:54,348 --> 00:10:55,766
I got to be honest.

278
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,801
You're kind of confusing
my head right now.

279
00:10:57,885 --> 00:10:58,802
I mean,
do you remember

280
00:10:58,886 --> 00:11:00,187
what you said when

281
00:11:00,254 --> 00:11:01,722
you talked me
into joining Glee Club?

282
00:11:01,773 --> 00:11:02,773
(bell ringing)

283
00:11:02,857 --> 00:11:04,191
Nationals are
in New York City.

284
00:11:04,258 --> 00:11:06,276
Can you imagine
at it's going to be like

285
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,278
coming home
with that first-place trophy?

286
00:11:08,362 --> 00:11:11,815
Most of the kids in this town
have never even seen the ocean.

287
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:14,367
We'll be gods.

288
00:11:14,435 --> 00:11:16,603
I joined up
because I'm new here

289
00:11:16,654 --> 00:11:18,538
and you said
it would make me popular,

290
00:11:18,606 --> 00:11:20,440
and now you're telling me that
it's going to get me killed.

291
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:22,492
Well, eventually you're going
get popular from it,

292
00:11:22,577 --> 00:11:23,994
believe me,
but until then,

293
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:26,747
you got to lay low
a little bit,

294
00:11:26,798 --> 00:11:28,114
a-and singing a duet
with another dude

295
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,583
is not laying low.

296
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:32,385
I didn't realize you had
a problem with gay dudes.

297
00:11:32,453 --> 00:11:34,387
Look, I don't have
a problem with gay dudes.

298
00:11:34,455 --> 00:11:36,173
Everyone else does,
and we're living

299
00:11:36,257 --> 00:11:38,675
in their world,
and in their world,

300
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,344
you singing a duet with Kurt
is a death sentence.

301
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:43,597
(sighs)

302
00:11:43,648 --> 00:11:45,015
Well,

303
00:11:45,099 --> 00:11:46,483
I gave him my word.

304
00:11:48,352 --> 00:11:50,487
In my world, that's that.

305
00:11:54,242 --> 00:11:56,359
Boom!

306
00:11:56,444 --> 00:11:58,995
Welcome to Glee Club,
lady lips.

307
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,914
(laughter)

308
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,922
The blueberry flavor
is the worst,

309
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:11,258
especially if it gets
down your pants.

310
00:12:11,325 --> 00:12:13,159
<i>I looked like a creature
out of Avatar down there</i>

311
00:12:13,211 --> 00:12:14,377
when I got Slushied.

312
00:12:15,763 --> 00:12:18,799
<i>I saw Avatar,
like, six times.</i>

313
00:12:20,268 --> 00:12:22,219
Oh.

314
00:12:22,303 --> 00:12:25,105
Anyway,
you'll get used to it.

315
00:12:26,274 --> 00:12:27,390
You're the head cheerleader.

316
00:12:27,475 --> 00:12:28,692
Why do you even bother?

317
00:12:28,776 --> 00:12:30,527
I mean, you don't
need Glee Club.

318
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:36,316
I like to sing...
and the fact is

319
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:37,868
those guys were
pretty cool to me

320
00:12:37,952 --> 00:12:39,536
last year
when I wasn't on top.

321
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,037
What's the point
of being popular

322
00:12:41,105 --> 00:12:43,323
when you can't do
what you want?

323
00:12:43,374 --> 00:12:45,492
<i>Lor manari.</i>

324
00:12:46,761 --> 00:12:49,746
It means you have
pretty eyes.

325
00:12:49,831 --> 00:12:52,833
<i>It's Nav'i... the
Avatar language.</i>

326
00:12:54,502 --> 00:12:55,952
<i>Lor manari.</i>

327
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:00,891
First course is served.

328
00:13:00,975 --> 00:13:02,592
Heart-healthy
vegan carrot soup

329
00:13:02,677 --> 00:13:04,144
with whole grain
croutons,

330
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:06,129
and you'd better eat
all of it.

331
00:13:06,197 --> 00:13:08,715
Do you have any idea how hard it
is to find saffron in this town?

332
00:13:08,766 --> 00:13:11,685
All right, let me eat
this at the table.

333
00:13:11,736 --> 00:13:13,436
You could make a
plaster cast of my ass

334
00:13:13,521 --> 00:13:14,654
with the cushions
from this couch.

335
00:13:14,722 --> 00:13:15,989
Absolutely not.

336
00:13:16,056 --> 00:13:18,191
I am in charge
of your care from now on.

337
00:13:18,242 --> 00:13:19,993
You had a serious
arrhythmia, Dad.

338
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,612
The doctors say you need to
rest until your stress test.

339
00:13:22,697 --> 00:13:25,532
You're my stress test.

340
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:28,201
Guess this means
I can't get salt?

341
00:13:30,404 --> 00:13:32,339
(sighs)

342
00:13:32,406 --> 00:13:33,740
Chin up.

343
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:34,875
What's up?

344
00:13:34,926 --> 00:13:36,843
How's school?

345
00:13:36,911 --> 00:13:38,044
(sighs)

346
00:13:38,095 --> 00:13:40,463
It's fine, I guess.

347
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:46,386
There's this new kid Sam
in Glee Club.

348
00:13:46,437 --> 00:13:48,922
He and I are singing
a duet together.

349
00:13:48,973 --> 00:13:50,140
Is that a problem?

350
00:13:50,224 --> 00:13:53,977
Finn practically
begged me not to.

351
00:13:54,061 --> 00:13:56,112
He said it'd ruin
Sam's reputation.

352
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,733
Well, this kid
Sam, uh...

353
00:13:59,784 --> 00:14:01,735
you know, does he, he
play for your team?

354
00:14:01,802 --> 00:14:03,153
Undetermined.

355
00:14:03,237 --> 00:14:04,404
Oh.

356
00:14:04,472 --> 00:14:06,656
Maybe Finn has a point.

357
00:14:06,741 --> 00:14:08,742
You're siding with him

358
00:14:08,793 --> 00:14:10,276
after what he called me
in our basement?

359
00:14:10,328 --> 00:14:13,747
I was talking to Carole, and you
weren't totally honest with me.

360
00:14:13,814 --> 00:14:16,166
She told me that you
had a crush on Finn

361
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,834
and you weren't
afraid to show it.

362
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:18,802
Is this true?

363
00:14:18,886 --> 00:14:20,453
So a gay guy
can't be friendly

364
00:14:20,504 --> 00:14:22,288
to a straight guy
without it being predatory?

365
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,473
You got to understand

366
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:24,641
that most guys don't
know how to deal

367
00:14:24,725 --> 00:14:26,676
with unwanted advances.

368
00:14:26,761 --> 00:14:28,228
So you're saying I shouldn't
sing with this Sam guy

369
00:14:28,295 --> 00:14:30,964
because it might upset
a couple homophobes?

370
00:14:31,015 --> 00:14:32,966
I thought you said no one
pushes the Hummels around.

371
00:14:33,017 --> 00:14:34,000
(sighs)

372
00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:35,001
No one does.

373
00:14:35,069 --> 00:14:36,252
I-I'm, I'm not saying that.

374
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,537
I-I'm, I'm saying

375
00:14:37,605 --> 00:14:41,191
that maybe it's
you who's pushing

376
00:14:41,258 --> 00:14:43,276
this kid Sam around,
trying to take advantage of him

377
00:14:43,327 --> 00:14:44,861
because you're interested
in him.

378
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:47,664
Dad, you have no idea
what it's like.

379
00:14:47,732 --> 00:14:51,201
I am the only openly gay kid
at school, in this town.

380
00:14:51,285 --> 00:14:53,086
I mean, why can't I walk
hand in hand

381
00:14:53,153 --> 00:14:54,921
down the hall
with a person that I like?

382
00:14:54,989 --> 00:14:56,740
Why can't I slow-dance
at my prom?

383
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,343
Come here.

384
00:15:05,132 --> 00:15:06,967
You think I don't want
those things for you?

385
00:15:07,018 --> 00:15:08,051
I do.

386
00:15:09,337 --> 00:15:11,805
You know, until
you find somebody

387
00:15:11,856 --> 00:15:15,909
as open and as
brave as you,

388
00:15:15,977 --> 00:15:19,913
you're just going to have to
get used to going it alone.

00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:03,660
Yes.
You hear that, guys?

441
00:18:03,744 --> 00:18:06,563
You have your work
cut out for you.

442
00:18:15,134 --> 00:18:16,418
Don't worry,

00:18:16,485 --> 00:18:18,303
<i>I'm not going to go
all Shawshank on you.</i>

444
00:18:18,354 --> 00:18:19,854
This is kind of weird.

445
00:18:19,939 --> 00:18:23,108
Guys usually don't talk
to each other in here.

446
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:24,475
Well, this can't wait.

447
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:25,994
I'm setting you free.

448
00:18:26,078 --> 00:18:28,863
You can do your duet
with someone else in Glee,

449
00:18:28,948 --> 00:18:32,317
someone that the world deems
more appropriate.

450
00:18:32,385 --> 00:18:33,835
Did I do something
to offend you?

451
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,787
No, no, I...

452
00:18:35,838 --> 00:18:38,873
It's not you, it's me.

453
00:18:38,941 --> 00:18:40,375
You've been honorable,
actually,

454
00:18:40,443 --> 00:18:43,595
and I wish you
the best,

455
00:18:43,662 --> 00:18:45,663
but I've realized that I need
to sing with someone

456
00:18:45,715 --> 00:18:47,632
that matches my passion
and talent level.

457
00:18:47,683 --> 00:18:48,850
Who's that?

458
00:18:48,918 --> 00:18:50,802
You know, they make
special shampoo

459
00:18:50,853 --> 00:18:52,387
for color-treated hair.

460
00:18:54,106 --> 00:18:55,307
I don't dye my hair.

461
00:18:55,358 --> 00:18:56,524
Uh-huh.

462
00:18:56,609 --> 00:18:57,692
This is a disaster.

463
00:18:57,777 --> 00:18:58,693
Could you stop pacing?

464
00:18:58,778 --> 00:18:59,961
It's stressing me out.

465
00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:02,180
It's just,
being the "it couple"

466
00:19:02,231 --> 00:19:03,815
is so much harder
than I thought.

467
00:19:03,866 --> 00:19:06,951
I-I am so stumped
at how to lose this thing.

468
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:08,787
Wait, I got it.

469
00:19:08,854 --> 00:19:10,655
<i>You remember we saw
Grease and it was good,</i>

470
00:19:10,706 --> 00:19:12,407
<i>and then we saw Grease 2,
and I fell asleep,</i>

471
00:19:12,491 --> 00:19:13,825
but you said
the difference

472
00:19:13,893 --> 00:19:16,361
was that the songs were bad.
Were bad.

473
00:19:16,412 --> 00:19:17,495
Yeah

474
00:19:17,546 --> 00:19:19,647
If we want to lose,

475
00:19:19,715 --> 00:19:22,267
we have to do a song that's bad.

476
00:19:22,318 --> 00:19:24,903
Not just a bad song,
an offensive song.

477
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,154
(claps)

478
00:19:26,238 --> 00:19:27,922
<i>Yes!
Artie.
Mm-hmm.</i>

479
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,640
Can we talk?
Yeah.

480
00:19:29,692 --> 00:19:30,992
I want us to be
duet partners.

481
00:19:31,077 --> 00:19:32,110
Really?

482
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:33,778
We sing really well
together.

483
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:35,780
I just thought
if we won,

484
00:19:35,831 --> 00:19:38,850
we could share a nice,
free dinner together

485
00:19:38,918 --> 00:19:40,118
as friends.

486
00:19:40,186 --> 00:19:42,337
We haven't
really talked.

487
00:19:42,421 --> 00:19:44,089
Well, Tina, as
rich as I find it

488
00:19:44,156 --> 00:19:45,340
that you've come
crawling back,

489
00:19:45,424 --> 00:19:46,941
I'll have
you know that

490
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:48,793
not only do I have
a duet partner

491
00:19:48,844 --> 00:19:49,961
but that our
working relationship

492
00:19:50,012 --> 00:19:51,963
has blossomed into romance.

493
00:19:55,768 --> 00:19:58,136
If you'll excuse me.

494
00:19:58,187 --> 00:20:00,304
WILL:
Okay, guys, so...

495
00:20:00,356 --> 00:20:02,574
who is up first today?

496
00:20:02,641 --> 00:20:03,575
Mr. Shue, if I may.

497
00:20:03,642 --> 00:20:04,526
You may.

498
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,432
As many of you know,
I had a duet partner,

499
00:20:10,499 --> 00:20:12,150
but due to sensitivities
I'd rather not get into

500
00:20:12,218 --> 00:20:15,036
at the moment, I have
dissolved the partnership.

501
00:20:15,104 --> 00:20:18,039
Okay, so who are you going
to sing a duet with?

502
00:20:18,124 --> 00:20:21,426
Only the most talented member
of the glee club-- myself.

503
00:20:23,396 --> 00:20:26,431
When you're different,
when you're special,

504
00:20:26,498 --> 00:20:28,850
sometimes you have
to get used to being alone.

505
00:20:28,918 --> 00:20:30,685
I've asked a few members
of the glee club

506
00:20:30,753 --> 00:20:32,170
as well as some Cheerios!
to help me out.

507
00:20:32,238 --> 00:20:34,055
How can you do a duet
by yourself?

508
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,723
That's like vocal masturbation
or something.

509
00:20:35,808 --> 00:20:36,808
(scattered snickering)

510
00:20:36,859 --> 00:20:38,226

(fingers snap)

564
00:23:21,506 --> 00:23:23,141
Le Jazz Hot.

565
00:23:23,192 --> 00:23:25,376
(song ends, laughter, whooping)

Yeah!
Yeah!

568
00:23:30,515 --> 00:23:33,568
(applause, indistinct shouts)

569
00:23:33,652 --> 00:23:35,286
I love astronomy.

570
00:23:35,354 --> 00:23:36,854
Something about all that space

571
00:23:36,905 --> 00:23:39,190
makes my problems
seem kind of small.

572
00:23:39,241 --> 00:23:41,376
That one's Venus.

573
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,244
Planet of love.

574
00:23:43,329 --> 00:23:46,030
It's actually Mars,
planet of war.

575
00:23:48,217 --> 00:23:50,168
<i>Which one are we on?</i>

576
00:23:50,219 --> 00:23:51,702
Earth.

577
00:23:51,754 --> 00:23:53,504
So why don't you
come back to it

578
00:23:53,555 --> 00:23:54,839
and talk to me
about duets.

579
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:58,259
Tell me why I should
be singing with you.

580
00:23:58,327 --> 00:24:00,061
Okay.

581
00:24:00,145 --> 00:24:01,896
Well, I want to start off
with the choreography.

582
00:24:04,216 --> 00:24:08,069
Singing will be easy,
so I'll start playing...

583
00:24:08,153 --> 00:24:09,804
(chords strumming)

584
00:24:09,872 --> 00:24:12,240
All right, now
get behind me.

585
00:24:12,324 --> 00:24:13,724
(quietly): Get behind me.

586
00:24:13,776 --> 00:24:17,028
(continues strumming)

587
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,365
Good.

588
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:22,116
Now grab my hips.

589
00:24:22,201 --> 00:24:24,402
And start swaying.

590
00:24:27,756 --> 00:24:30,541
All right, now,
here's the cool part.

591
00:24:30,592 --> 00:24:32,427
(stops strumming)
Give me your hand.

592
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,930
Do you know how to play?

593
00:24:36,015 --> 00:24:38,966
(whispers):
No.

594
00:24:39,051 --> 00:24:41,052
All right, it's easy.

595
00:24:41,103 --> 00:24:43,104
Just put that
finger there.

596
00:24:43,188 --> 00:24:44,856
Just like that.

597
00:24:44,923 --> 00:24:47,408
(strumming quietly)

598
00:24:47,476 --> 00:24:49,410
Now do it fast
back and forth.

599
00:24:49,478 --> 00:24:51,446
(chord changes)

600
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:52,980
There you go.

601
00:24:53,065 --> 00:24:54,682
(chord changes)

602
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,769
(slowly stops strumming)

603
00:25:04,109 --> 00:25:05,626
No. No, I can't do this.

604
00:25:05,711 --> 00:25:07,745
Th year is about me.

605
00:25:07,813 --> 00:25:10,581
And don't say that I'm selfish,
because you have no idea

606
00:25:10,632 --> 00:25:12,216
how much I've given.
I wasn't... I wasn't gonna...

607
00:25:12,284 --> 00:25:14,335
I've been down this path before;
I know this feeling.

608
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,387
(anxious sigh)
Like, I need you.

609
00:25:16,455 --> 00:25:19,090
Duets don't work for me,
and I don't need you.

610
00:25:19,141 --> 00:25:21,843
What I need is to find a way
to keep Santana off my heels.

611
00:25:21,927 --> 00:25:24,429
I'm... I'm sorry...
What I need is to find a
way to torture Rachel.

612
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,682
And I need to start
learning to ignore people.

613
00:25:27,766 --> 00:25:29,934
And I'm sorry,
I shouldn't...

614
00:25:29,985 --> 00:25:30,968
I shouldn't have tried that.

615
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:33,071
I'm sorry.

616
00:25:33,138 --> 00:25:36,641
I made a mistake,
and, um...

617
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:38,776
I don't want to
sing with you.

618
00:25:40,863 --> 00:25:42,280
(bell rings)

619
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,814
I don't think I could do this.

620
00:25:45,865 --> 00:25:47,699
It's the perfect song
for this very situation.

621
00:25:47,767 --> 00:25:49,751
Whenever you're ready, guys.

622
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:51,920
SANTANA: Yeah, hurry up;
I needs to get myself

623
00:25:51,988 --> 00:25:53,038
to Breadstix.

624
00:25:53,122 --> 00:25:54,656
Don't count on it.

625
00:25:54,707 --> 00:25:56,742
I'm mad at you, but
you're still so hot.

626
00:25:58,278 --> 00:26:00,996

Wow!

678
00:27:39,178 --> 00:27:42,014
<i>Now, that
is a duet!</i>

679
00:27:42,081 --> 00:27:44,016
Thank you, Tina,
for introducing us

680
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,268
to the amazing voice
of Mike Chang!

681
00:27:47,654 --> 00:27:48,470
That was good.

682
00:27:52,575 --> 00:27:54,109
(groans)

683
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,146
You tried to kiss her?
Major Glee party foul, dude.

684
00:27:58,197 --> 00:28:00,699
Look, I know I shouldn't have.

685
00:28:00,783 --> 00:28:03,618
She was just sending
me these vibes.

686
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,037
And those eyes.

687
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,207
Hey, Quinn, can we talk?

688
00:28:09,292 --> 00:28:12,044
What do you want
to talk about?
About Sam. I-I heard

689
00:28:12,128 --> 00:28:14,713
that you backed out of
doing the duet with him.

690
00:28:14,797 --> 00:28:16,348
Maybe it's for the best
she backed out.

691
00:28:16,432 --> 00:28:18,467
I mean, if that Puckerman kid
ever gets out of jail,

692
00:28:18,518 --> 00:28:20,052
he's gonna
beat my ass.

693
00:28:20,136 --> 00:28:21,219
I'm sure you still have
feelings for her, too.

694
00:28:21,304 --> 00:28:23,221
No, no, no way.
I'm with Rachel now.

695
00:28:23,306 --> 00:28:25,307
I mean, she's a lot
shorter than Quinn

696
00:28:25,358 --> 00:28:28,026
and she talks a lot,
but I'm in love with her.

697
00:28:28,111 --> 00:28:30,112
Look, th-this isn't
about dating, dude.

698
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:31,563
This is about you
singing with Quinn

699
00:28:31,647 --> 00:28:33,281
to raise your musical rep
in the group.

700
00:28:33,349 --> 00:28:36,985
Look, I understand
that your reputation
is important to you, but...

701
00:28:37,036 --> 00:28:39,571
wouldn't you want
to do whatever it
takes to be on top

702
00:28:39,655 --> 00:28:41,689
of the proverbial pyramid in
every aspect of your life?

703
00:28:41,741 --> 00:28:43,575
Singing with Sam
won't change that.

704
00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:45,077
Oh, but winning
the competition will.

705
00:28:45,161 --> 00:28:47,529
And partnering with Sam is
really your only shot at it.

706
00:28:50,216 --> 00:28:52,167
What's your angle?

707
00:28:52,218 --> 00:28:53,635

What's your
angle?

Me winning means you losing,

709
00:28:55,088 --> 00:28:56,972
and you'll do whatever
it takes to make sure

710
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,141
that doesn't happen,
so what is in it for you?

711
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:00,592
Look, I agree.

712
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,644
Okay? You're probably not
gonna beat Finn and I,

713
00:29:02,711 --> 00:29:04,379
but I just thought that,

714
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,465
as the team captain, it
would be good for the team

715
00:29:06,532 --> 00:29:09,935
to have some healthy competition
for second place.

Look, I'm not saying you're
gonna win, but I'm just saying</i>

717
00:29:12,455 --> 00:29:13,905
that, you know,
even coming in second

718
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:17,993
would go a long way with
the rest of the team.

happen again,

Hi. Excuse me.
Do you know Brittany?

00:36:01,631 --> 00:36:02,815
Cheerios! Brittany?

854
00:36:02,882 --> 00:36:04,850

Yeah. We had sex.

858
00:36:11,658 --> 00:36:13,642
that she can't get
from someone else

859
00:36:13,693 --> 00:36:16,578
is ser choice parking.

860
00:36:16,646 --> 00:36:19,381
I know that sex
don't mean anything to you,

861
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:22,785
but did you ever think
how much it means to me?

862
00:36:22,852 --> 00:36:25,254
After my accident,

863
00:36:25,321 --> 00:36:28,674

be able even to do that.

that I could,

865
00:36:30,827 --> 00:36:32,594
it seemed like
some kind of miracle,

866
00:36:32,662 --> 00:36:35,030

all over that.

00:36:35,098 --> 00:36:37,549
You're not my
partner anymore.

868
00:36:37,617 --> 00:36:40,619

of the duet competition.

00:36:40,687 --> 00:36:42,387
Artie, I didn't know. I'm...

870
00:36:42,472 --> 00:36:44,439
I'm so sorry.

871
00:36:53,967 --> 00:36:57,285
Okay, since Artie
and Brittany have dropped

872
00:36:57,337 --> 00:37:00,222
out of the race, I guess it's
time to take it to a vote.

873
00:37:15,972 --> 00:37:18,524
Well, even though
it looks like

874
00:37:18,608 --> 00:37:20,592
just about everyone voted
for themselves--

875
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,977
even those who didn't compete--

876
00:37:22,028 --> 00:37:23,328
we do have a winner.

877
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:28,717
And the winner is...

878
00:37:32,255 --> 00:37:33,222
...by two votes...

879
00:37:34,924 --> 00:37:35,674
...Sam and Quinn.

880
00:37:35,758 --> 00:37:37,309
What? What?

881
00:37:37,393 --> 00:37:38,844
Screw that!
I want my stix!

882
00:37:38,928 --> 00:37:40,262
Ooh, let it go.
Let go. Let it go!

883
00:37:40,313 --> 00:37:41,847
Unbelievable.

884
00:37:41,931 --> 00:37:43,849
It was mine! No, I don't
know how this happened.

885
00:37:43,933 --> 00:37:45,300
Son.

886
00:37:45,351 --> 00:37:46,768
Unbelievable.

887
00:37:46,819 --> 00:37:48,570
(sighs happily)

888
00:37:48,638 --> 00:37:50,022
(quietly):
This is so not a date.

889
00:37:50,106 --> 00:37:52,441
We did it, babe.

890
00:37:52,492 --> 00:37:54,109
(bell ringing)

891
00:37:54,177 --> 00:37:57,079
Hey, I had something
I wanted to talk to you about.

892
00:37:57,146 --> 00:37:58,647
Oh, please not
another pregnancy.

893
00:37:58,698 --> 00:38:01,650
I think that you and I are
a little bit more similar

894
00:38:01,701 --> 00:38:03,652
than you think.

895
00:38:03,703 --> 00:38:05,954
That's a terrible thing to say.

896
00:38:07,423 --> 00:38:09,708
I know you're lonely.

897
00:38:09,792 --> 00:38:13,445
I can't even imagine
how hard it must be

898
00:38:13,513 --> 00:38:16,281
to have feelings in high
school that you can't act on

899
00:38:16,349 --> 00:38:20,802
for fear of being humiliated,
ridiculed or worse.

900
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:23,021
We're going to win
Nationals this year,

901
00:38:23,089 --> 00:38:25,607
and you know how
we're ing to do that?

902
00:38:25,675 --> 00:38:27,225
Because we have you.

903
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:30,145
That's true.

904
00:38:30,213 --> 00:38:32,314
That's 12 people
who love you just

905
00:38:32,382 --> 00:38:35,701
for being exactly
the way that you are.

906
00:38:35,768 --> 00:38:38,687
Look, I'm know
you're lonely, but...

907
00:38:38,738 --> 00:38:40,572
you're not alone.

908
00:38:42,742 --> 00:38:44,376
So, I was wondering

909
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,696
if you would maybe want
to sing a duet with me?

910
00:38:47,747 --> 00:38:50,532
I think you'll be really
happy with my song selection.

911
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:52,801
It's sort of everything
that both you and I love.

912
00:38:52,868 --> 00:38:54,920
But the, uh, duet
competition is over.

913
00:38:55,004 --> 00:38:56,555
I know. I just...

914
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:59,057
I thought this one
could be for me and you.

915
00:38:59,142 --> 00:39:01,643
(bell ringing)

916
00:39:01,711 --> 00:39:04,012
You know, I hear they don't even
make these fresh.

917
00:39:04,063 --> 00:39:05,814
They fly them in frozen
from some factory

918
00:39:05,881 --> 00:39:07,332
in the Dominican Republic.

919
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,686
I once caught some pretty sweet
waves down in the Dominican.

920
00:39:10,737 --> 00:39:14,323
Hey, hey, hey.

921
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,557
Uh-uh.

922
00:39:15,608 --> 00:39:17,058
Come on.

923
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:19,060
It's my Matthew McConaughey
impression-- come on.

924
00:39:19,112 --> 00:39:20,862
Does that work on the girls
where you're from?

925
00:39:20,913 --> 00:39:24,499
The impressions,
the bad jokes,

926
00:39:24,567 --> 00:39:26,818
the Nav'i?

927
00:39:26,886 --> 00:39:28,420
Uh, I don't know.
I don't know.

928
00:39:28,488 --> 00:39:29,988
I went to an all-boys
boarding school.

929
00:39:30,056 --> 00:39:32,090
Makes sense.

930
00:39:33,292 --> 00:39:35,327
It must be hard.

931
00:39:35,395 --> 00:39:38,463
I think if I went through
what you went through last year,

932
00:39:38,548 --> 00:39:41,133
I would have transferred
to a school on the moon

933
00:39:41,217 --> 00:39:42,718
or something,
out of embarrassment.

934
00:39:42,769 --> 00:39:45,137
Okay, that-that didn't
come out right. I mean,

935
00:39:45,221 --> 00:39:48,290
you're really brave
to come back like you have.

936
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:50,108
I don't judge you or anything.

937
00:39:50,193 --> 00:39:53,378
I know what it's like
to have a...

938
00:39:53,446 --> 00:39:55,647
secret that you're ashamed of.

939
00:39:55,732 --> 00:39:59,651
Oh, holy crap. So you...

940
00:39:59,736 --> 00:40:01,203
So you are gay?

941
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,821
(laughs):
What?

942
00:40:02,905 --> 00:40:04,773
No. Not at all.

943
00:40:04,824 --> 00:40:06,742
When I found out
I was moving here,

944
00:40:06,793 --> 00:40:08,660
I wanted to seem cool, you know?

945
00:40:08,728 --> 00:40:11,380
<i>Figured if I looked
like Swayze in Point Break,</i>

946
00:40:11,447 --> 00:40:13,665
people might think
I was a surfer or something.

947
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,067
(laughs)

948
00:40:15,134 --> 00:40:16,518
I didn't think it
through very clearly.

949
00:40:16,586 --> 00:40:21,673
So... I put lemon juice
in my hair.

950
00:40:21,758 --> 00:40:24,426
I would have gotten away
with it, if it hadn't been

951
00:40:24,477 --> 00:40:26,011
for Kurt and his sixth sense.

952
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,118
I think it looks cute.

953
00:40:33,186 --> 00:40:35,203
Really?

954
00:40:35,271 --> 00:40:37,022
(laughs)

955
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:39,024
(sighs)

956
00:40:42,745 --> 00:40:44,112
What are you doing?

957
00:40:44,163 --> 00:40:45,263
We're not using that.

958
00:40:45,331 --> 00:40:46,581
You're paying.

959
00:40:46,649 --> 00:40:47,866
Why?

960
00:40:47,934 --> 00:40:51,703
Because a gentleman always
pays on the first date.
