97
00:05:58,543 --> 00:06:00,210
Frank and elly,
let's show them

98
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,844
just a sample of the dance.

99
00:06:01,912 --> 00:06:04,712
My land, he gives away
his show for nothing.

100
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:07,180
Just a sample
of the dance. Diddly-dum.

101
00:06:20,523 --> 00:06:22,123
Looking out to sea.

102
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:24,057
[Laughter]

103
00:06:24,126 --> 00:06:25,658
That was a fine
thing to do,

104
00:06:25,726 --> 00:06:27,460
giving my present
to a colored cook.

105
00:06:27,527 --> 00:06:30,094
Pete, if steve
knew you sent me
that brooch,

106
00:06:30,162 --> 00:06:32,429
i declare he'd about
beat you to death.

107
00:06:32,497 --> 00:06:33,863
You'd better be
nice to me,

108
00:06:33,932 --> 00:06:35,531
or you'll
be sorry.

109
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:37,166
I said, stay away
from my wife.

110
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:39,366
I reckon i won't do
any more talking
about it!

111
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:41,468
[Crowd screaming]

112
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:44,170
Steve! Please!

113
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,404
Steve!

114
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,673
Aah!

115
00:06:49,774 --> 00:06:51,908
Steve, get up there.
Get up there!

116
00:06:53,376 --> 00:06:54,776
Let go of me.

117
00:06:54,844 --> 00:06:57,212
We had you fooled,
didn't we? Ha ha!

118
00:06:57,278 --> 00:06:59,079
That was just a sample,
just a sample.

119
00:06:59,147 --> 00:07:02,247
The boys were showing you
a scene from one of our plays.

120
00:07:02,316 --> 00:07:04,748
That's the way they are...
always skylarking,

121
00:07:04,817 --> 00:07:06,617
always playing pranks.

122
00:07:06,685 --> 00:07:08,751
Just one big, happy family.

123
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,053
[Laughter]

124
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:16,156
I'll be having lunch
at mrs. Benson's.

125
00:07:16,224 --> 00:07:17,456
All right,
parthy.

126
00:07:17,525 --> 00:07:18,958
Well, miss laverne.

127
00:07:19,025 --> 00:07:20,925
That was nice
goings on this morning.

128
00:07:20,994 --> 00:07:22,526
It wasn't
julie's fault.

129
00:07:22,595 --> 00:07:24,061
And you protecting her!

130
00:07:24,128 --> 00:07:27,296
One thing
i'm thankful for...
magnolia wasn't there.

131
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,097
I don't want my daughter
mixed up with you

132
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:30,631
or anybody like you.

133
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,666
Mrs. Hawks,
please don't say that.

134
00:07:32,734 --> 00:07:35,801
Nola... nola's just like
a little sister to me.

135
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,170
Mr. Hawks, if i've
got to stop seeing her,

136
00:07:38,237 --> 00:07:40,338
i just can't
stay on the show boat.

137
00:07:40,404 --> 00:07:41,838
I just can't!

138
00:07:41,907 --> 00:07:44,006
Now you done it.
Now you done it!

139
00:07:44,075 --> 00:07:46,008
The best
leading lady
on the river.

140
00:07:46,075 --> 00:07:47,575
Oh, captain andy,

141
00:07:47,643 --> 00:07:49,978
if julie goes,
could i try
for the lead?

142
00:07:50,044 --> 00:07:51,578
Why, elly... ha ha ha!

143
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:54,580
There ain't a funnier
gal on the river
than you are.

144
00:07:54,647 --> 00:07:56,515
Oh, captain andy,
don't!

145
00:07:56,581 --> 00:08:00,017
Don't stamp your foot down
on real acting ability!

146
00:08:00,084 --> 00:08:01,618
Leave go
my husband's knee!

147
00:08:01,685 --> 00:08:04,720
And you! You think more
of your show boat crew

148
00:08:04,786 --> 00:08:07,320
than you do of your own
daughter's upbringing.

149
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:09,955
Where i come from,
no decent body

150
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:12,724
would touch
this show boat riffraff
with a 10-foot pole,

151
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,158
let alone
having their daughters
mixed up with them.

152
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:18,628
I'll have more
to say to you later.

153
00:08:18,695 --> 00:08:21,796
Ha ha ha!

154
00:08:21,864 --> 00:08:26,499
Just one big,
happy family.

155
00:08:27,902 --> 00:08:30,768
[Man]
¶ who cares if my boat
goes upstream ¶

156
00:08:30,836 --> 00:08:37,006
¶ or if the gale bids me go
with the river's flow? ¶

157
00:08:37,073 --> 00:08:41,275
¶ i drift along with my fancy ¶

158
00:08:41,342 --> 00:08:44,077
¶ sometimes i thank
my lucky stars ¶

159
00:08:44,144 --> 00:08:47,678
¶ my heart is free ¶

160
00:08:47,747 --> 00:08:49,047
what are you
looking at?

161
00:08:49,114 --> 00:08:50,548
I bet he's
an aristocrat.

162
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:52,215
Look at the cracks
in his shoes.

163
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:57,818
¶... wonder, "where's
the mate for me?" ¶

164
00:08:57,886 --> 00:09:00,153
hello.

165
00:09:00,988 --> 00:09:02,688
How do you do?

166
00:09:02,756 --> 00:09:04,023
Do you live here?

167
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:06,390
Oh, no.
I'm just a wayfarer
along the river.

168
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,525
So am i. Which way
are you going?

169
00:09:08,593 --> 00:09:10,426
Either way.
Where are you going?

170
00:09:10,494 --> 00:09:11,894
Anywhere papa
gives shows.

171
00:09:11,961 --> 00:09:13,527
Oh, are you
a player?

172
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:16,062
Like on the piano?
Yes, i play a little.

173
00:09:16,131 --> 00:09:17,697
Was that you
i heard?

174
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,866
Yes, that was me.

175
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:20,933
What a pity.

176
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,567
What did you say, mister?

177
00:09:22,635 --> 00:09:24,569
When i asked if you
were a player,

178
00:09:24,635 --> 00:09:26,236
i meant,
are you an actress?

179
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:29,938
Oh! Oh, no.
But i'd give anything
if i could be.

180
00:09:30,006 --> 00:09:31,239
Why?

181
00:09:31,307 --> 00:09:33,941
Because you can
make believe so many
wonderful things

182
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:35,675
that never happen
in real life.

183
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,642
Oh, but wonderful things
do happen.

184
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,144
Why, this very day,

185
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:41,245
i was walking
upon the levee,
feeling blue,

186
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,913
and suddenly,
i looked up, and...

187
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,447
i must go now.

188
00:09:44,515 --> 00:09:45,847
Oh, why?

189
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,317
You're talking to me,
and i don't know you.

190
00:09:48,383 --> 00:09:49,717
Does that
really matter?

191
00:09:49,785 --> 00:09:51,184
No. Not to me.

192
00:09:51,253 --> 00:09:52,953
If you like to
make believe things,

193
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:54,620
make believe
we know each other.

194
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:57,488
Yes! We haven't
seen each other
for 75 years,

195
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,424
and you're
my long-lost nephew.

196
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,291
<i>There's a scene like that
in the village drunkard.</i>

197
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:04,627
Oh, no. 75 years
is too long.

198
00:10:04,694 --> 00:10:06,627
Besides, you know,
i don't think

199
00:10:06,696 --> 00:10:08,862
i'd like the idea of
being your nephew.

200
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:10,496
Let's suppose
we've just met.

201
00:10:10,564 --> 00:10:12,564
Well, we really have.

202
00:10:12,632 --> 00:10:16,567
Well... let's suppose

What for?

233
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,807
Nothing serious,
but you'd better
come along

234
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,775
and have a talk
with him.

235

Why are you always
dragging them big feet

chunks of lead?

242
00:13:40,493 --> 00:13:42,493
Take your time,
queenie.

243
00:13:42,561 --> 00:13:46,162
Take my time?
I got to have that flour
to bake the bread.

244
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,730
It won't run away
from you, queenie.

And if it do,

Give me that flour.
Give me it!

Queenie.

00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,838
You got anything else
for me to do?

'Cause why?

00:14:02,173 --> 00:14:04,873
'Cause if you ain't,
i got some whittling
left over.

251

I'd like to
get it finished.

252
00:14:06,442 --> 00:14:08,743
Joe, i believe you're
the laziest man

253
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,543
that ever
lived on this river.

254
00:14:10,612 --> 00:14:14,713
On this river,
queenie, that's
saying a whole lot.

255
00:14:14,781 --> 00:14:17,315
Yeah, that's saying
a whole lot.

256
00:14:17,382 --> 00:14:19,182
There will be
some taters to peel later,

257

for you,

258
00:14:21,218 --> 00:14:23,251

Hello, miss nola.
I didn't know
you was up there.

263

Yep, i seen him.

Have you seen miss julie?
I got to tell her.

what she thinks.

Ask miss julie
what she thinks.

270
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,774
Better ask the ol' river
what he thinks.

271
00:14:58,841 --> 00:15:01,208
He knows all about
them boys.

272

Why?

00:19:29,308 --> 00:19:31,841
Never mind. Tell me
about this man.
Who is he?

320
00:19:31,908 --> 00:19:34,143
Well, i don't know.
He was standing
on the wharf,

321
00:19:34,209 --> 00:19:36,644
and i was standing
on the top deck,

322
00:19:36,712 --> 00:19:39,346
and he looked
so different from
everybody else

323
00:19:39,413 --> 00:19:40,880
and so beautiful.

324
00:19:40,948 --> 00:19:42,380
Julie, he said
he liked me.

325
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:44,516
You think
he meant it?

326
00:19:44,582 --> 00:19:46,350
I don't know
as i like you

327
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,985
falling in love
with some man
no one's heard of.

328
00:19:49,053 --> 00:19:52,054
Suppose he turned out
to be a no-account
river fellow?

329
00:19:52,121 --> 00:19:54,854
If he was
no-account,
i'd stop loving him.

330
00:19:54,923 --> 00:19:56,389
Oh, no, you wouldn't.

331
00:19:56,457 --> 00:20:00,158
Once a girl like you
starts to love a man,
she don't stop so easy.

332
00:20:00,226 --> 00:20:03,594
Well, couldn't you
stop loving steve
if he treated you mean?

333
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:06,395
No, honey.
No matter what he did.

334
00:20:06,463 --> 00:20:08,331
Why do you
love steve?

335
00:20:08,398 --> 00:20:11,632
Oh, i don't know.
He's such a bad actor
on the stage,

336
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,199
and he thinks
he's so good.

337
00:20:13,268 --> 00:20:14,901
Maybe that's
why i love him.

338
00:20:14,969 --> 00:20:17,836
You see, nola,
love is such
a funny thing.

339
00:20:17,904 --> 00:20:19,437
There's no sense
to it.

340
00:20:19,505 --> 00:20:21,304
That's why you've
got to be careful

341
00:20:21,373 --> 00:20:22,939
when it creeps up
on you.

342
00:20:23,007 --> 00:20:26,240
It's like the thing
you always sing about
on our walks.

343
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:30,277
¶ fish gotta swim,
birds gotta fly ¶

344
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:34,713
¶ i gotta love one man
till i die ¶

345
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:41,450
¶ can't help lovin'
that man of mine ¶

346
00:20:41,518 --> 00:20:43,052
that's it.

347
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,020
¶ tell me he's lazy,
tell me he's slow ¶

348
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:51,390
¶ tell me i'm crazy,
maybe i know ¶

349
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:58,194
¶ can't help lovin'
that man of mine ¶

350
00:20:58,261 --> 00:20:59,862
how come you all
know that song?

351
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:01,730
Why? Do you
know it, queenie?

352
00:21:01,797 --> 00:21:03,598
Sure, i does,
but i only heard

353
00:21:03,665 --> 00:21:05,099
colored folks
sing it.

354
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,100
Sounds funny
for miss julie
to know it.

355
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:09,101
Julie sings it
all the time.

356
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:10,736
Can you sing
the whole thing?

357
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:13,803
Course i can.
What's so funny about that?

358
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:18,406
¶ oh, listen, sister,
i love my mister man ¶

359
00:21:18,475 --> 00:21:21,009
¶ and i can't
tell you why ¶

360
00:21:21,075 --> 00:21:26,545
¶ there ain't no reason
why i should love that man ¶

361
00:21:27,813 --> 00:21:29,279
¶ it must be somethin'¶

362
00:21:29,347 --> 00:21:34,517
¶ that the angels
done plan ¶

363
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:38,252
¶ fish gotta swim,
birds gotta fly ¶

364
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,687
¶ i gotta love
one man till i die ¶

365
00:21:41,756 --> 00:21:48,958
¶ can't help lovin'
that man of mine ¶

366
00:21:49,027 --> 00:21:52,427
¶ tell me he's lazy,

367
00:21:52,496 --> 00:21:56,096
¶ tell me i'm crazy,

368
00:21:56,164 --> 00:22:02,200
¶ can't help lovin'
that man of mine ¶

369
00:22:03,468 --> 00:22:10,272
¶ when he goes away,
that's a rainy day ¶

370
00:22:10,339 --> 00:22:15,041
¶ but when he comes back,
the day is fine ¶

371
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:17,043
¶ the sun will shine ¶

372
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:21,912
¶ he can come home
as late as can be ¶

373
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,615
¶ home without him
ain't no home to me ¶

374
00:22:25,681 --> 00:22:33,253
¶ can't help lovin'
that man of mine ¶

375
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,820
that's beautiful,
miss julie.

376
00:22:35,889 --> 00:22:38,922
Why, that's
my favorite song.

377
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:41,391
[Queenie]
¶ my man is shiftless ¶

378
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:43,726
¶ and good-for-nothin',
too ¶

379
00:22:43,793 --> 00:22:46,460
¶ he's my man
just the same ¶

380
00:22:46,529 --> 00:22:52,898
¶ he's never near me
when there's work to do ¶

381
00:22:52,965 --> 00:23:00,269
¶ he's never round you
when there's workin' to do ¶

382
00:23:00,336 --> 00:23:04,939
¶ the chimney's smokin',
the roof is leakin' in ¶

383
00:23:05,006 --> 00:23:07,773
¶ but he don't
seem to care ¶

384
00:23:07,842 --> 00:23:12,543
¶ he can be happy
with just a sip of gin ¶

385
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:15,345
¶ why are you all
talking about gin? ¶

386
00:23:15,412 --> 00:23:20,581
¶ i even loves him
when his kisses
got gin ¶

387
00:23:22,017 --> 00:23:25,317
¶ fish gotta swim,
birds gotta fly ¶

388
00:23:25,386 --> 00:23:28,754
¶ i gotta love
one man till i die ¶

389
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:32,556
¶ can't help lovin'
that man of mine ¶

390
00:23:32,623 --> 00:23:35,690
¶ or else
she ain't my gal ¶

391
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:39,193
¶ tell me he's lazy,
tell me he's slow ¶

392
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,628
¶ tell me i'm crazy,

393
00:23:42,696 --> 00:23:46,831
¶ can't help lovin'
that man of mine ¶

394
00:23:46,898 --> 00:23:49,699
¶ she's just as crazy
'bout me ¶

395
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:53,168
¶ when he goes away ¶

396
00:23:53,235 --> 00:23:56,336
¶ that's a rainy day ¶

397
00:23:56,405 --> 00:24:01,474
¶ and when he comes back,
that day is fine ¶

398
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,241
look at that gal, sugar.

399
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:06,910
¶ he can come home
as late as can be ¶

400
00:24:06,977 --> 00:24:10,345
¶ home without him

401
00:24:10,414 --> 00:24:17,050
¶ can't help lovin'

402
00:24:17,117 --> 00:24:18,684
magnolia!

403
00:24:35,228 --> 00:24:36,661
Say, dealer,
what was the turn?

404
00:24:36,729 --> 00:24:38,229
Ace won,
and king lost.

405
00:24:38,297 --> 00:24:40,131
Raise you
30 more.

406
00:24:40,197 --> 00:24:42,132
50 more
on the king.

407
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:46,801
Who's that
sporting gambler
over there?

408
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,268
Name's gaylord ravenal.

409
00:24:48,337 --> 00:24:49,736
Sounds familiar.

410
00:24:49,804 --> 00:24:52,004
Yeah. Got in
a little fuss here
about a year ago.

411
00:24:52,072 --> 00:24:54,272
Proved self-defense
and got out.

412
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:57,441
The judge just told him
he'd better clear out of here
by nightfall.

413
00:24:57,509 --> 00:24:58,475
Waiter!

414
00:24:58,542 --> 00:24:59,942
We'll be late
for rehearsal.

415
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,244
One more.

416
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,245
Can i talk
to you, sir?

417
00:25:03,312 --> 00:25:05,646
Yeah, if you got
anything to say.

418
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:07,247
See that?

419
00:25:07,314 --> 00:25:09,381
Why, that's
miss julie laverne,
ain't it?

420
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,882
Yeah. That's what
she calls herself

421
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,917
since she got married
to a white man.

422
00:25:12,985 --> 00:25:13,918
What?

423
00:25:13,986 --> 00:25:16,052
Frank, i want you
to hear this.

424
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,219
You, too, elly.

425
00:25:17,287 --> 00:25:19,155
Sit down
and explain yourself.

426
00:25:19,222 --> 00:25:22,356
And you'll make sure
you know what you're
talking about.

427
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,526
[Captain andy]
Let's go on with rehearsal.

428
00:25:26,593 --> 00:25:28,627
Good evening,
miss lucy.

429
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,294
I was absorbed
in meditation

430
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:32,630
and did not realize
night had fallen.

431
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:34,964
The days are growing
shorter, hamilton,

432
00:25:35,031 --> 00:25:37,633
but they're long
when one is waiting.

433
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,434
As i came
across the field,
i saw the cattle

434
00:25:41,502 --> 00:25:44,670
being driven home
by your faithful dog.

435
00:25:44,738 --> 00:25:46,172
You got that,
rubber face?

436
00:25:46,238 --> 00:25:47,639
Yep. I got
a cowbell.

437
00:25:47,705 --> 00:25:48,839
[Clang]

438
00:25:48,907 --> 00:25:50,774
It ain't a cowbell.

439
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:53,708
It says here,
"cows moo
offstage."

440
00:25:53,777 --> 00:25:55,177
Have you got
a moo affect?

441
00:25:55,244 --> 00:25:57,344
Oh, i can
do that myself.

442
00:25:57,412 --> 00:25:59,213
Moo!

443
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,413
Try that again
a little deeper.

444
00:26:01,481 --> 00:26:04,149
Moo!

445
00:26:04,216 --> 00:26:06,717
No, i guess
you better
ring the bell.

446
00:26:06,784 --> 00:26:08,018
May i make
a suggestion,
captain?

447
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:09,019
Huh?

448
00:26:09,085 --> 00:26:10,652
I thought it would
be good if,

449
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,354
while i was
talking over there,

450
00:26:12,421 --> 00:26:14,889
for frank
to pass the window
and peek through,

451
00:26:14,956 --> 00:26:16,156
like this.

452
00:26:17,591 --> 00:26:19,558
You can't. Room's
on the second floor.

453
00:26:19,626 --> 00:26:21,026
Frank couldn't
look through the window

454
00:26:21,093 --> 00:26:22,493
if it was on
the second floor.

455
00:26:22,561 --> 00:26:24,160
It wouldn't be
any good anyway.

456
00:26:24,229 --> 00:26:25,595
Julie let me
study her part.

457
00:26:25,663 --> 00:26:27,262
I know every line
and all the business.

458
00:26:27,331 --> 00:26:29,264
If you forget anything,
ask me.

459
00:26:29,332 --> 00:26:30,832
You stick to the piano,
young lady.

460
00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:33,900
No playacting for you.

461
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,468
[Captain andy]
All right, now try it.

462
00:26:36,536 --> 00:26:38,469
Oh, there you are!
You're late.

463
00:26:38,537 --> 00:26:41,738
I'll explain later.
Steve, i got something
to tell you.

464
00:26:41,805 --> 00:26:42,806
Where's frank?

465
00:26:42,873 --> 00:26:44,240
He's coming.

466
00:26:44,308 --> 00:26:45,942
<i>Is thall you're
going to say to them?</i>

467
00:26:46,008 --> 00:26:47,742
She said she'd
explain later,
didn't she?

468
00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:49,510
Humph!
Fine disciplining
this troupe's got.

469
00:26:49,578 --> 00:26:51,011
Humph!

470
00:26:51,078 --> 00:26:52,579
He'll be here
any second.

471
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:54,313
[Captain andy]
As we're waiting
for frank,

472
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,013
we'll cut
right down
to his entrance.

473
00:26:56,082 --> 00:26:57,981
All right,
steve.

474
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,017
Oh. All right.

475
00:27:02,285 --> 00:27:05,086
Miss lucy, although
i wear the clothes...

476
00:27:05,154 --> 00:27:06,354
garb.

477
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:08,821
Garb of a parson,
beneath these
somber vestments,

478
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:11,557
there is the heart
of a man that ats
for you alone.

479
00:27:11,624 --> 00:27:13,358
Hamilton.

480
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,293
[Elly]
They'll be here
any second.

481
00:27:17,361 --> 00:27:18,961
Embrace over.
Then what?

482
00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:21,196
Then... then
i say, uh...

483
00:27:21,263 --> 00:27:22,830
prompt her,
noli.

484
00:27:22,898 --> 00:27:24,631
[Magnolia]
Hamilton,
my own, my...

485
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,764
papa, look
at julie!

486
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:26,766
What's
the matter?

487
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:27,834
Julie's
sick.

488
00:27:27,901 --> 00:27:29,034
What's
the matter, julie?

489
00:27:29,102 --> 00:27:31,002
Land's sakes!

490
00:27:36,707 --> 00:27:39,341
Sure you won't be
feeling better
by tonight?

491
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:43,743
No, no. Let me alone.
Can't you leave me alone?

492
00:27:43,811 --> 00:27:46,845
[Captain andy]
Hello, windy.
What are you doing here?

493
00:27:46,913 --> 00:27:48,946
Just come over
to warn you.

494
00:27:49,014 --> 00:27:51,915
Seen pete
coming along the levee
with the sheriff.

495
00:27:51,983 --> 00:27:53,249
Be along any minute.

496
00:27:53,317 --> 00:27:55,683
Well, let him
come on board.
Our license is paid.

497
00:27:55,752 --> 00:27:58,318
Seems that skunk pete's
up to something.

498
00:27:58,387 --> 00:27:59,819
Seen him yank
a picture of julie

499
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:01,654
out of a frame
on the levee.

500
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:02,755
I seen him.

501
00:28:02,822 --> 00:28:04,389
What are we
going to do?

502
00:28:04,457 --> 00:28:07,391
Stay right here.
You know what
i told you.

503
00:28:07,459 --> 00:28:09,626
Steve!
What are you doing
with that knife?

504
00:28:09,693 --> 00:28:11,760
I'm not going to
hurt her, you fool.

505
00:28:11,828 --> 00:28:14,262
Leave me be.
I know what i'm doing.

506
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,463
It won't
hurt much, darling.

507
00:28:17,331 --> 00:28:18,264
Aah!

508
00:28:18,332 --> 00:28:20,199
Steve!

509
00:28:47,249 --> 00:28:49,050
Hello,
windy.

510
00:28:49,118 --> 00:28:50,184
Captain
hawks,

511
00:28:50,251 --> 00:28:51,518
do you
acknowledge

512
00:28:51,586 --> 00:28:53,586
to be owner of
the show boat?

513
00:28:53,654 --> 00:28:55,720
Why, of course i do.

514
00:28:55,788 --> 00:28:56,955
What do you want?

515
00:28:57,023 --> 00:28:58,422
I have
an unpleasant duty.

516
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:01,457
I understand that you
have a miscegenation
case on board.

517
00:29:01,525 --> 00:29:02,457
What's that?

518
00:29:02,526 --> 00:29:03,692
[Captain andy]
How's that?

519
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,926
A case of a negro woman
married to a white man...

520
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,927
a criminal offense
in this state.

521
00:29:07,995 --> 00:29:10,597
No. No such thing
on board this boat.

522
00:29:10,664 --> 00:29:13,798
The name
of the white man
is steve baker.

523
00:29:15,134 --> 00:29:17,100
The name
of the negress...

524
00:29:17,168 --> 00:29:19,869
the name
of the negress
is julie dosher.

525
00:29:19,936 --> 00:29:21,370
Which one's
them?

526
00:29:21,437 --> 00:29:25,339
I am steve baker.
This is my wife.

527
00:29:27,241 --> 00:29:29,508
Julie dosher,
my information says

528
00:29:29,575 --> 00:29:31,510
you were born
in mississippi.

529
00:29:31,576 --> 00:29:34,077
Your pop was white,
your mammy black.

530
00:29:34,146 --> 00:29:35,545
Is that right?

531
00:29:35,613 --> 00:29:37,212
Yes, that's right.

532
00:29:37,281 --> 00:29:39,248
You two better
get your things

533
00:29:39,315 --> 00:29:40,815
and come along
with me.

534
00:29:40,882 --> 00:29:43,483
You wouldn't
call a man a white man

535
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,284
that had negro blood
in him, would you?

536
00:29:45,352 --> 00:29:47,285
No, i wouldn't,
not in mississippi.

537
00:29:47,353 --> 00:29:48,920
One drop
of negro blood

538
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,921
makes you a negro
in these parts.

539
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:54,756
Well, i got more than a drop
of negro blood in me,

540
00:29:54,825 --> 00:29:56,457
and that's a fact.

541
00:29:57,959 --> 00:29:59,493
Are you ready
to swear that

542
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:00,960
in a court of law?

543
00:30:01,028 --> 00:30:02,728
I'll swear to it
anyplace.

544
00:30:02,797 --> 00:30:04,596
I'll do more
than that.

545
00:30:04,663 --> 00:30:06,998
Look at all
these folks here.

546
00:30:07,066 --> 00:30:08,498
Every one of them
can swear

547
00:30:08,567 --> 00:30:10,766
that i got negro blood
in me this minute.

548
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:13,069
That's how white i am.

549
00:30:14,236 --> 00:30:17,004
Well, i've seen
fairer men than you

550
00:30:17,072 --> 00:30:18,472
that were negroes.

551
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:20,605
Still,
you better tell that
to the judge.

552
00:30:20,674 --> 00:30:24,508
Ahem! Ike vallon,
you've known me

553
00:30:24,576 --> 00:30:26,509
the better part
of 25 years.

554
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:29,478
I was keelboating
when you was running barefoot

555
00:30:29,546 --> 00:30:31,013
around the landing.

556
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,848
Now, i'm telling you...
me, windy mcclain...

557
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,350
that white man's
got negro blood in him.

558
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:38,784
But this fellow
told me...

559
00:30:38,851 --> 00:30:41,018
i don't care
what anybody told you.

560
00:30:41,087 --> 00:30:43,520
I'm taking my oath
on what i just said.

561
00:30:43,588 --> 00:30:45,788
Steve's got
negro blood in him.

562
00:30:47,091 --> 00:30:49,890
Do you all stand by
what windy just said?

563
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:51,291
Of course we do.

564
00:30:53,027 --> 00:30:55,461
You look like
a respectable woman.

565
00:30:55,529 --> 00:30:56,928
I am.

566
00:30:56,996 --> 00:30:59,963
Windy wouldn't tell a lie
to save his own life.

567
00:31:00,032 --> 00:31:01,231
You know that, sheriff.

568
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:02,498
Yes, i know.

569
00:31:02,567 --> 00:31:05,233
I reckon i'll have to take
windy's word for it,

570
00:31:05,301 --> 00:31:07,434
but from now on,
it's your business and not mine.

571
00:31:07,503 --> 00:31:08,535
I warn you...

572
00:31:08,603 --> 00:31:10,470
if these folks around here
ever got wind

573
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:12,738
that you've got negroes
acting with whites,

574
00:31:12,806 --> 00:31:14,740
they'll ride you
out of town

575
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,441
on something that won't
set so easy as a boat.

576
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:19,142
Get away from that window!

577
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,843
Go on about your business.
Break it up!

578
00:31:26,547 --> 00:31:28,481
Now you go!
Both of you!

579
00:31:28,548 --> 00:31:30,982
You needn't look at us
like that.

580
00:31:31,051 --> 00:31:32,984
We're not going to
hurt you.

581
00:31:33,051 --> 00:31:36,219
We're going right away.
Come on, honey.

582
00:31:39,555 --> 00:31:41,489
Julie! Julie!

583
00:31:41,557 --> 00:31:42,990
Nola, where are
you going?

584
00:31:43,058 --> 00:31:44,491
I'm going to julie!

585
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:45,991
Come back here
this instant.

586
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,493
No daughter of mine
will talk to that...

587
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,027
let me go, mother!

588
00:31:54,031 --> 00:31:57,866
I think my show boat's
made a darn fine gal
out of my daughter.

589
00:31:57,933 --> 00:32:00,534
But where
do we go from here?
Hanged if i know.

590
00:32:00,602 --> 00:32:03,269
We can't give
no more shows
without a leading man.

591
00:32:03,337 --> 00:32:05,036
Or a leading lady.

592
00:32:05,105 --> 00:32:06,971
I can play
the lead, can't i?

593
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,472
No. You're
a comedienne.

594
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:11,241
I was thinking
maybe we'd let
noli jump in.

595
00:32:11,308 --> 00:32:12,741
She knows
all the parts.

596
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:13,942
Over my dead body.

597
00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:15,977
There never was
an actress in my family,

598
00:32:16,044 --> 00:32:17,311
and there ain't
going to be.

599
00:32:17,378 --> 00:32:21,080
Now if only there
was anybody to play
steve's part.

600
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:22,748
What about frank?

601
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,082
[Parthy]
Hmm!

602
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,750
Fine leading man
he'd make

603
00:32:25,817 --> 00:32:27,283
with that face
and those flat feet.

604
00:32:27,352 --> 00:32:29,285
I never asked
to play leads, did i?

605
00:32:29,352 --> 00:32:31,920
I never set up
to be a beauty.

606
00:32:31,988 --> 00:32:33,421
Just a minute,
captain!

607
00:32:33,489 --> 00:32:35,289
Mercy! Something
must be on fire,

608
00:32:35,356 --> 00:32:36,523
the way
queenie's running.

609
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,790
Now what's
the trouble,
queenie?

610
00:32:37,858 --> 00:32:39,992
There's a powerful
fine-looking fellow out here.

611
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:42,026
Wants to know if you-all
could accommodate him

612
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:44,127
by taking him down the river
far as the next town.

613
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:45,228
We don't carry
no passengers...

614
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,695
fine-looking,
did you say?

615
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:47,997
Is he an actor?

616
00:32:48,063 --> 00:32:51,932
Might be, but he seems more
like the kind of a gentleman

617
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,933
it's a pleasure to wait on.

618
00:32:54,002 --> 00:32:55,601
There he is.

619
00:32:55,668 --> 00:32:56,935
I thought, sir,
if i could have

620
00:32:57,003 --> 00:32:58,970
a bed on your boat
tonight,

621
00:32:59,037 --> 00:33:01,538
i could pay my way
as far as fort adams.

622
00:33:01,606 --> 00:33:02,806
You ain't
an actor,
are you?

623
00:33:02,873 --> 00:33:04,973
An actor, sir?
No, captain.

624
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:08,475
I'm a ravenal.
Gaylord ravenal is my name,

625
00:33:08,544 --> 00:33:10,644
of the tennessee ravenals.

626
00:33:10,711 --> 00:33:13,112
I knew it. He looked
like an aristocrat to me.

627
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:16,214
Aristocrat? Huh!
Looks more like
a river gambler.

628
00:33:16,282 --> 00:33:18,215
Well, i'm going to
take a chance.

629
00:33:18,283 --> 00:33:19,750
Look here, sir.

630
00:33:19,817 --> 00:33:22,484
I'm looking for a juvenile
leading man.

631
00:33:22,552 --> 00:33:25,186
Am i to understand
you're offering me
the position, sir?

632
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:28,021
Andy hawks will wind up
in a lunatic asylum yet.

633
00:33:28,088 --> 00:33:30,756
If you can
play the parts
to my satisfaction,

634
00:33:30,825 --> 00:33:32,758
i'll give you
$15 a week

635
00:33:32,825 --> 00:33:34,492
and a chance
to see the world.

636
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:35,793
I've seen it.

637
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,993
We don't usually pick up actors
off the wharves,

638
00:33:38,061 --> 00:33:39,829
but we can't be choosy
just now.

639
00:33:39,896 --> 00:33:43,498
Madam, your courtesy
is only exceeded
by your charm.

640
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:45,199
Ha ha ha!

641
00:33:45,265 --> 00:33:46,499
Mother! Father!

642
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:48,500
Don't let them go,
please, papa!

643
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,935
Don't send julie and steve
away like this.

644
00:33:51,003 --> 00:33:52,937
Nobody will know about them
in the next town.

645
00:33:53,003 --> 00:33:54,537
Julie's my friend.

646
00:33:54,605 --> 00:33:56,206
That's a nice thing
to say.

647
00:33:56,272 --> 00:33:58,206
Well, she is! She is!

648
00:33:58,274 --> 00:33:59,941
She's been my friend ever since
she's been on this boat,

649
00:34:00,008 --> 00:34:01,708
and if you're going to
send her away

650
00:34:01,776 --> 00:34:03,443
for something she can't help,
i'll go, too!

651
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,443
Nola!

652
00:34:04,511 --> 00:34:05,944
Nola, don't talk nonsense.

653
00:34:06,012 --> 00:34:07,445
You've got to stay here
with your mother,

654
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:08,946
no matter what.

655
00:34:09,014 --> 00:34:10,948
And another thing...
i'm depending on you

656
00:34:11,014 --> 00:34:13,382
to play the leads
till we can get somebody.

657
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:15,183
See, nola?
What a chance for you.

658
00:34:15,251 --> 00:34:16,751
I just know
you can act.

659
00:34:16,818 --> 00:34:18,519
And if this young man
wants to play the leads

660
00:34:18,587 --> 00:34:19,819
and play opposite you,

661
00:34:19,887 --> 00:34:22,654
i can get you both ready
by tomorrow night.

662
00:34:22,722 --> 00:34:24,655
Are you a quick study?

663
00:34:24,724 --> 00:34:25,923
Lightning.

664
00:34:25,991 --> 00:34:27,492
[Steve]
Ready, julie?

665
00:34:27,558 --> 00:34:29,492
I didn't have time
to get everything
together, captain.

666
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,960
If you'll bundle up
our trash

667
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,461
and leave it
at the post office
in new orleans,

668
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:34,963
we'll pick it up.

669
00:34:35,029 --> 00:34:36,963
Do you need
any money, steve?

670
00:34:37,031 --> 00:34:39,465
No. I guess we'll
make out all right.

671
00:34:39,533 --> 00:34:40,966
Thanks. Good-bye.

672
00:34:41,033 --> 00:34:42,467
Good-bye, steve.

673
00:34:42,534 --> 00:34:44,368
Forget it.

674
00:34:44,436 --> 00:34:45,969
Good-bye, nola.

675
00:34:47,137 --> 00:34:52,607
I'll write to you,
and you write to me,

676
00:35:02,013 --> 00:35:03,947
julie! Julie!

677
00:35:04,014 --> 00:35:06,147
Don't look back,
darling.

678
00:35:09,951 --> 00:35:12,418
Bye, master steve.

679
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:15,187
Good-bye, miss julie.

680
00:35:15,255 --> 00:35:16,687
Bye, joe.

681
00:35:16,756 --> 00:35:18,154
Good-bye, joe.

682
00:35:21,025 --> 00:35:22,292
Good-bye.

683
00:35:42,372 --> 00:35:43,938
We ain't got much time.

684
00:35:44,005 --> 00:35:46,439
Mr. Ravenal, i want to see
how you handle dialogue.

685
00:35:46,507 --> 00:35:48,474
Will you read
that speech right there?

686
00:35:48,542 --> 00:35:50,408
Now, the idea
of this character is

687
00:35:50,476 --> 00:35:51,910
you're in love with her.

688
00:35:51,976 --> 00:35:53,911
Now, come on.
Just a sample.

689
00:35:53,978 --> 00:35:55,379
What do i do,
papa?

690
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:56,913
Oh, you just smile.
That'll get them.

691
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,313
Miss lucy,
will you be mine?

692
00:35:58,381 --> 00:36:00,115
Hmm!

693
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:01,882
Ha ha ha! Gosh, no.
Nothing like it.

694
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,417
More feeling.
More like you meant it.

695
00:36:04,485 --> 00:36:06,885
You love her. Gosh almighty,
man, you love her!

696
00:36:06,953 --> 00:36:08,619
Go on and tell her.

697
00:36:08,688 --> 00:36:10,388
Oh, i understand.

698
00:36:11,989 --> 00:36:14,823
Miss lucy,
will you be mine?

699
00:36:19,794 --> 00:36:22,662
Ha ha ha!

700
00:36:34,504 --> 00:36:35,636
[Applause]

701
00:36:57,451 --> 00:36:58,650
Did you like it,
mrs. Ewing?

702
00:36:58,718 --> 00:37:00,151
I've seen it
four times.

703
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:01,419
I liked it
better than ever.

704
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:03,420
Don't you think
the leading man
is gorgeous?

705
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:05,422
Yes. He took his part
off quite good.

706
00:37:05,488 --> 00:37:07,689
I liked the leading lady
the best, though.

707
00:37:07,757 --> 00:37:09,891
Did you understand the moral
of the play, my dear?

708
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:12,426
Oh, sure, mom.
Did you see
how he kissed her?

709
00:37:12,493 --> 00:37:15,393
Yes. I hardly thought
that was in the best of taste.

710
00:37:15,462 --> 00:37:17,429
Well, that's
show business.

711
00:37:17,496 --> 00:37:18,896
What's show business?

712
00:37:18,964 --> 00:37:22,098
I've been trouping
up and down this river
for 12 years.

713
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:23,599
Nobody ever heard of me.

714
00:37:23,667 --> 00:37:25,934
This ravenal has been
acting exactly three weeks.

715
00:37:26,001 --> 00:37:27,935
They make a star
out of him.

716
00:37:28,003 --> 00:37:29,936
I feel the same way,
frank.

717
00:37:30,004 --> 00:37:31,371
Look at magnolia.

718
00:37:31,438 --> 00:37:33,939
Her picture with ravenal
is on all the posters.

719
00:37:34,006 --> 00:37:35,706
We're not in town
an hour

720
00:37:35,774 --> 00:37:37,941
before captain andy
has their faces
on every ashcan.

721
00:37:38,009 --> 00:37:39,943
You want to know the secret
of their quick success?

722
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,911
They're falling in love
with each other.

723
00:37:41,978 --> 00:37:43,345
What's that got
to do with it?

724
00:37:43,412 --> 00:37:45,946
Well, they make love
on the stage,
and it rings true.

725
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:47,280
That's why they're a hit.

726
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,448
Well, i've been
playing opposite you
for five years,

727
00:37:49,516 --> 00:37:50,849
and i love you.

728
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:53,451
Yeah, but maybe
i don't love you.

729
00:37:53,518 --> 00:37:55,885
So you're responsible
for our failure!

730
00:37:55,953 --> 00:37:58,387
We'll never be stars
on this show boat.

731
00:37:58,455 --> 00:38:01,389
You talk
as if you expected
to live on this barge

732
00:38:01,457 --> 00:38:02,890
the rest
of your life.

733
00:38:02,957 --> 00:38:04,890
Ain't you got
no ambition?

734
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:07,892
Sure,
i got ambition.
I want to marry you.

735
00:38:07,961 --> 00:38:10,894
You know our rules,
mr. Schultz.

736
00:38:10,962 --> 00:38:12,895
No gentleman
allowed in no lady's
dressing room.

737
00:38:12,963 --> 00:38:14,397
He was only waiting
while l...

738
00:38:14,464 --> 00:38:15,897
you know the rules,
too, miss shipley.

739
00:38:15,965 --> 00:38:17,633
Out, mr. Schultz!

740
00:38:18,867 --> 00:38:19,867
Hello, frank.

741
00:38:19,935 --> 00:38:21,401
Hello, ravenal.

742
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:22,636
Huh!

743
00:38:32,442 --> 00:38:33,609
Uh...

744
00:38:37,445 --> 00:38:39,380
the show, uh...

745
00:38:39,446 --> 00:38:41,346
uh...

746
00:38:41,415 --> 00:38:43,415
the show seemed
to go well tonight.

747
00:38:43,483 --> 00:38:44,782
Yes. Didn't it?

748
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:47,851
Yes, it did.

749
00:38:49,486 --> 00:38:51,419
Hasn't the weather
been fine?

750
00:38:51,488 --> 00:38:54,421
Yes, hasn't
the weather been fine?

751
00:38:56,391 --> 00:38:57,990
Well, good night.

752
00:38:58,058 --> 00:39:00,259
Good night.

753
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:58,161
It seems to me i've seen
that stocking someplace.

754
00:39:58,228 --> 00:40:01,229
Where could it have been?

755
00:40:01,297 --> 00:40:03,630
Don't you belong
to a miss magnolia hawks?

756
00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:07,366
I thought so.

757
00:40:07,434 --> 00:40:08,901
Next time you see he

758
00:40:08,968 --> 00:40:11,436
will you give her
a message for me?

759
00:40:11,503 --> 00:40:13,904
I can talk to you
better than i can to her.

760
00:40:13,971 --> 00:40:17,907
I always get flustered
when i try to say
anything to her.

761
00:40:17,973 --> 00:40:19,673
Tell her...

762
00:40:21,042 --> 00:40:24,911
tell her you saw
the young man
who lives upstairs,

763
00:40:24,977 --> 00:40:27,446
and... well,
that's just the point.

764
00:40:27,512 --> 00:40:30,180
I have the room
above her.

765
00:40:30,248 --> 00:40:34,450
¶ she doesn't know
i love her ¶

766
00:40:34,517 --> 00:40:39,086

in harmony]

802
00:43:57,342 --> 00:43:59,275
Ha ha ha!

803
00:43:59,343 --> 00:44:01,411
Isn't it
a beautiful night?

804
00:44:01,477 --> 00:44:04,679
Yes. It's so light.
Where's the moon?

805
00:44:04,746 --> 00:44:07,013
We could see it better
if we went up on top deck.

806
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,181
Oh, no, i couldn't.

807
00:44:09,249 --> 00:44:12,116
I'll wait up there
for you.

808
00:44:19,322 --> 00:44:21,989
Oh, you came.
I was afraid
you wouldn't.

809
00:44:22,057 --> 00:44:23,290
I can't stay.

810
00:44:23,357 --> 00:44:25,291
Oh, but you can
a little while.

811
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,292
Not a minute.
Mother saw me.

812
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,293
I said i was coming up
to the water barrel.

813
00:44:29,361 --> 00:44:30,294
Good.

814
00:44:30,362 --> 00:44:32,796
Then she said
she was thirsty, too,

815
00:44:32,864 --> 00:44:35,564
so i'll have to hurry
and take it down to her,

816
00:44:35,632 --> 00:44:37,066
or she'll get suspicious.

817
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:38,066
Will you...

818
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:40,301
will you come up
again tomorrow night?

819
00:44:41,669 --> 00:44:43,302
And every night?

820
00:44:51,141 --> 00:44:52,742
Nola!

821
00:44:52,809 --> 00:44:55,476
Shut up and come
to bed, you old...

822
00:44:57,479 --> 00:44:58,412
oh.

823
00:44:58,479 --> 00:45:00,279
Oh, i'm sorry.
I'll fill it
for you.

824
00:45:00,348 --> 00:45:02,981
Will you forgive me,
magnolia?

825
00:45:03,048 --> 00:45:06,150
Yes... gay.

826
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:14,288
¶ then she goes
down to her room ¶

827
00:45:14,356 --> 00:45:19,625
¶ and i go sadly
back to mine ¶

828
00:45:23,328 --> 00:45:24,294

829
00:45:24,362 --> 00:45:26,329
I can't leave
the box office.

830
00:45:26,396 --> 00:45:28,329
Frank will take it
for you.

831
00:45:28,398 --> 00:45:30,331
There are
some things
more important

832
00:45:30,398 --> 00:45:31,832
than selling
tickets.

833
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,834
I'd like to know
what they are.

834
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:35,801
I'll tell you.
Come out!

835
00:45:35,869 --> 00:45:37,602
Oh, come on, frank.

836
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:39,069
Oh, all right.

837
00:45:39,138 --> 00:45:41,338
What do you want?
What is it now?

838
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:42,839
Listen to this.

839
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:45,340
"Dear mrs. Hawks,
i know captain andy
don't like me."

840
00:45:45,408 --> 00:45:46,340
Who is it?

841
00:45:46,409 --> 00:45:47,342
Pete.

842
00:45:47,409 --> 00:45:48,542
I don't like him.

843
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:50,243
"But i got something
of interest to tell him

844
00:45:50,311 --> 00:45:51,711
about gaylord ravenal."

845
00:45:51,778 --> 00:45:54,380
That's the man
your daughter's
gallivanting with.

846
00:45:54,447 --> 00:45:55,446

I ain't.

861
00:46:23,598 --> 00:46:25,798
All right. It's good
someone has a sense
of duty.

862
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:28,034
I like ravenal.
He's a right smart young man.

863
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,001
He's the best
leading man we ever had.

864
00:46:30,069 --> 00:46:31,802
Shifty,
that's what he is.

865
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:33,436
Mark my words...

866
00:46:33,504 --> 00:46:35,104
if you asked around
about him,

867
00:46:35,172 --> 00:46:36,271
you'd find
something queer,

868
00:46:36,339 --> 00:46:39,473
for all he says
he's a ravenal
of tennessee.

869
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:40,808
He is a ravenal!

870
00:46:40,876 --> 00:46:42,342
He says he is.

871
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:44,410
Didn't he show me
the tombstone of his folks?

872
00:46:44,477 --> 00:46:45,843
Hawks,
you're a zany.

873
00:46:45,912 --> 00:46:48,346
I could tell you
my name is bonaparte

874
00:46:48,413 --> 00:46:50,314
and show you
napoleon's tomb.

875
00:46:50,381 --> 00:46:52,214
That wouldn't make
him my grandfather,
would it?

876
00:46:52,283 --> 00:46:54,216
Oh!

877
00:46:54,283 --> 00:46:57,051

Excuse me, sir,
but this is
confederate money.

889

That's the kind
we use in the hills.

890
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:21,299
It's as good
as yours, ain't it?

891

Better.
But... but...

00:53:50,906 --> 00:53:53,307
He gets a spell like that
every once in a while.

1037
00:53:53,374 --> 00:53:54,540
Yeah.

1038
00:53:54,609 --> 00:53:55,875
Yeah.

1039
00:53:55,943 --> 00:53:57,876
Take it up, rubber face.
Take it up. Take it up.

1040
00:53:57,944 --> 00:53:59,411
Go on. Take it up!

1041
00:53:59,477 --> 00:54:01,412
Now, folks,
just before mr. Schultz

1042
00:54:01,479 --> 00:54:03,413
was tooken
with that attack,

1043
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,148
he and the parson
were on the verge

1044
00:54:06,216 --> 00:54:08,916
of going into one
of the most sensational

1045
00:54:08,984 --> 00:54:11,184
hand-to-hand struggles
to the death

1046
00:54:11,252 --> 00:54:12,785
ever seen on any stage.

1047
00:54:12,852 --> 00:54:16,887
Now, when egbert sees the parson
coming in through this door,

1048
00:54:16,956 --> 00:54:18,922
he should have said...

1049
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:20,924
"ha ha ha!

1050
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:24,426
I'm glad you come
when you did."

1051
00:54:24,493 --> 00:54:26,527
And with that,

1052
00:54:26,595 --> 00:54:29,429
he hauls off
and hits the parson.

1053
00:54:29,496 --> 00:54:32,431
But the parson knows
a thing or two,

1054
00:54:32,498 --> 00:54:36,433
and he gives egbert
something he ain't looking for.

1055
00:54:36,501 --> 00:54:38,834
"Take that, you cur!"

1056
00:54:38,903 --> 00:54:40,569
And down goes egbert.

1057
00:54:45,607 --> 00:54:48,441
Egbert, realizing that he ain't
going to win the fight

1058
00:54:48,507 --> 00:54:50,375
by fair means,
resorts to foul.

1059
00:54:50,443 --> 00:54:52,376
He grabs the parson
round the waist

1060
00:54:52,444 --> 00:54:54,410
and backheels him.

1061
00:54:54,479 --> 00:54:57,412
"Let go of me, i say.
Let go of me!"

1062
00:54:57,481 --> 00:55:01,415
Ow. In the meantime,
lucy is over here

1063
00:55:01,483 --> 00:55:03,416
praying for her beloved.

1064
00:55:03,484 --> 00:55:05,918
Now comes the big
dramatic moment.

1065
00:55:05,986 --> 00:55:08,953
Egbert, the dirty skunk,
reaches in his pocket,

1066
00:55:09,021 --> 00:55:12,456
pulls out a monkey wrench
with which he hits the parson.

1067
00:55:12,522 --> 00:55:14,457
"Uh!" the parson groans...

1068
00:55:14,524 --> 00:55:19,425
"wooo!"...
reels and falls.

1069
00:55:19,494 --> 00:55:22,227
Egbert is about to beat
the parson's brains out

1070
00:55:22,296 --> 00:55:23,662
when lucy says,

1071
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:28,431
"do with me what you will
but spare my hamilton!"

1072
00:55:28,499 --> 00:55:31,500
Now, as though providence
had heard her prayer,

1073
00:55:31,568 --> 00:55:32,967
the door swings open,

1074
00:55:33,036 --> 00:55:35,469
and through that door there
in walks emmy,

1075
00:55:35,537 --> 00:55:37,971
the errant foster sister
of lucy,

1076
00:55:38,038 --> 00:55:41,239
ready to right the wrong
she'd done poor lucy.

1077
00:55:43,309 --> 00:55:44,775
"Oh!"

1078
00:55:44,843 --> 00:55:46,442
Quick as lightning,

1079
00:55:46,511 --> 00:55:48,478
emmy, looking at the prostrate
form of the parson

1080
00:55:48,544 --> 00:55:50,412
and the weeping figure
of her heartbroken sister

1081
00:55:50,479 --> 00:55:52,913
begging egbert
to spare the parson,

1082
00:55:52,981 --> 00:55:54,615
grabs the water pitcher...

1083
00:55:54,682 --> 00:55:56,416
where's
the water pitcher?...

1084
00:55:56,483 --> 00:55:59,884
the water pitcher,
sneaks up on egbert and says,

1085
00:55:59,952 --> 00:56:03,220
"the wages of sin
is death!"

1086
00:56:03,287 --> 00:56:04,920
[Audience screams]

1087
00:56:04,989 --> 00:56:08,056
And she kills the dirty rascal
deader than a doornail.

1088
00:56:08,124 --> 00:56:09,556
Now that's what you
would have seen

1089
00:56:09,624 --> 00:56:10,924

for mr. Schultz

1090
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:12,826

01:03:15,253 --> 01:03:18,186
Andy! Andy!

1209
01:03:18,255 --> 01:03:19,888
Gosh almighty,
it's parthy.

1210
01:03:19,956 --> 01:03:21,988
He's a murderer.

1211
01:03:22,057 --> 01:03:23,224
Mamma!

1212
01:03:23,291 --> 01:03:25,292
You're letting
my daughter
marry a murderer.

1213
01:03:25,358 --> 01:03:26,392
Who?

1214
01:03:26,459 --> 01:03:28,427
That ravenal.
He killed a man!

1215
01:03:28,494 --> 01:03:29,427
Gay!

1216
01:03:29,495 --> 01:03:31,495
Then why ain't he
in jail or hanged?

1217
01:03:31,563 --> 01:03:33,030
The jury figured
the gentleman
he killed

1218
01:03:33,096 --> 01:03:34,530
ought to have
went anyhow.

1219
01:03:34,598 --> 01:03:36,464
Andy hawks, are you
going to stand there

1220
01:03:36,532 --> 01:03:38,567
and let
your only child
marry a murderer?

1221
01:03:38,633 --> 01:03:41,201
Oh, don't be so
narrow-minded,
mrs. Hawks.

1222
01:03:41,268 --> 01:03:43,235
I killed a man
meself once.

1223
01:03:43,304 --> 01:03:44,536
You killed?

1224
01:03:44,604 --> 01:03:47,805
Yes, me. Now, are you
coming with us,
or ain't you?

1225
01:03:47,873 --> 01:03:49,673
They're going to
be married.

1226
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:52,675
Married to
a murderer. Oh!

1227
01:03:52,742 --> 01:03:54,243
She's fainted!

1228
01:03:54,310 --> 01:03:55,243
Are you sure?

1229
01:03:55,311 --> 01:03:56,276
She's out.

1230
01:03:56,345 --> 01:03:58,979
Good! Now we'll go on
with the wedding.

1231
01:04:15,423 --> 01:04:18,391
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

There you go again.

1240
01:04:58,984 --> 01:05:00,950
Look at them peas
all over the floor.

1241
01:05:01,018 --> 01:05:02,384
The river done it.

1242
01:05:02,452 --> 01:05:03,819
The river done it?

1243
01:05:03,885 --> 01:05:06,253
That ol' river can do
most anything, queenie.

1244
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,954
Look out there
what it's doing now.

1245
01:05:09,023 --> 01:05:10,956
Won't let us give
no show tonight.

1246
01:05:11,023 --> 01:05:12,957
Show? That don't
worry me none.

1247
01:05:13,025 --> 01:05:16,193
There's something else
on this old boat
worries me more.

1248
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:17,193
Miss nola?

1249
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:18,461
That's what.

1250
01:05:18,528 --> 01:05:19,762
She'll be all right.

1251
01:05:19,829 --> 01:05:21,730
That's what you say
about everything.

1252
01:05:21,797 --> 01:05:24,864
You don't get excited.
Why? 'cause you don't
do nothing.

1253
01:05:24,933 --> 01:05:28,000
You don't cook like me,
you don't act like
the show folks,

What do you do?

1255
01:05:31,036 --> 01:05:32,936
Well, i just

No. I could have
if you didn't do it.

1258
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,873
I could do
a lot of things

1259
01:05:38,941 --> 01:05:40,374

1260
01:05:40,441 --> 01:05:41,541

He ain't drowned.

1325
01:08:51,392 --> 01:08:53,226

01:08:56,662 --> 01:08:58,629
And his baby

Gay didn't know it.

1330

We didn't
think that...

1331
01:09:03,366 --> 01:09:05,467
it's much sooner.

1332
01:09:05,534 --> 01:09:07,234
How could gay
know it?

1333
01:09:07,302 --> 01:09:10,270
Of course he couldn't.
Now, now, don't get
excited, deary.

Oh, lie back.
That's a girl.

Dragging me out of bed

You're making

Kim? That ain't
no name.

1367
01:10:43,662 --> 01:10:45,061
I made it up.

1368
01:10:45,129 --> 01:10:47,796
"K" for kentucky,
"l" for illinois,
and "m" for missouri,

1369
01:10:47,864 --> 01:10:50,765

born on the river

I knew you'd go carousing
the first chance you got

1380
01:11:19,683 --> 01:11:21,283
and break
my girl's heart,

1381
01:11:21,351 --> 01:11:22,817
and i wish
the lord had kept you

1382
01:11:22,886 --> 01:11:24,319
from ever setting foot
on this boat.

1383
01:11:24,386 --> 01:11:26,653
Indeed? Then you'll
be glad to know

1384
01:11:26,721 --> 01:11:28,154
that i'm leaving it
forever,

1385
01:11:28,222 --> 01:11:29,955
and i'm taking
my wife with me.

1386
01:11:30,023 --> 01:11:31,723
Humph. When?

1387
01:11:31,791 --> 01:11:33,524
The minute the river
goes down enough

1388
01:11:33,592 --> 01:11:35,559
for us to take
our things ashore.

1389
01:11:35,626 --> 01:11:37,961
You will not go today,
gaylord ravenal.

1390
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:40,262
Why not?
What have you to say
about it, anyway?

1391
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:41,896
She'll not
leave her home

1392
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:44,030
till you've money
to care for her proper,

1393
01:11:44,098 --> 01:11:46,699
and you know how long
before that will be.

1394
01:11:46,767 --> 01:11:48,199
And suppose
i was to tell you

1395
01:11:48,268 --> 01:11:50,468
that i had money,
and plenty of it?

1396
01:11:50,536 --> 01:11:52,803
I still say
you can't take a girl

1397
01:11:52,871 --> 01:11:55,404
that's been laying
close to death all night

1398
01:11:55,472 --> 01:11:58,540
and a 5-hour baby
off this boat today.

1399
01:11:58,608 --> 01:12:00,140
A baby?

1400
01:12:00,208 --> 01:12:01,976
A baby!

1401
01:12:05,012 --> 01:12:07,445
Nola.

1402
01:12:07,512 --> 01:12:08,446
Nola.

1403
01:12:08,513 --> 01:12:10,347
Shh!

1404
01:12:10,414 --> 01:12:14,148
Gay! We surprised you.

1405
01:12:14,217 --> 01:12:17,352
Who? Who
surprised me? You?

1406
01:12:17,418 --> 01:12:19,887
No. She did.

1407
01:12:26,491 --> 01:12:27,591
She's sleeping.

1408
01:12:27,658 --> 01:12:30,292
That's what her mother
should be doing.

1409
01:12:30,361 --> 01:12:32,760
Try to sleep, darling.

1410
01:12:37,031 --> 01:12:38,597
Humph.

1411
01:12:41,634 --> 01:12:44,201
Cootchy cootchy...

1412
01:12:47,137 --> 01:12:48,838
now, i want you
to get well quickly

1413
01:12:48,905 --> 01:12:50,838
so i can take you
to chicago with me,

1414
01:12:50,907 --> 01:12:52,873
just we three together.

1415
01:12:52,941 --> 01:12:55,041
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

1416
01:13:04,381 --> 01:13:05,781
Good morning.

1417
01:13:09,651 --> 01:13:11,751
Darling, is my hat
on straight?

1418
01:13:11,819 --> 01:13:13,486
You look enchanting.

1419
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:16,288
[Shouting]

1420
01:13:26,061 --> 01:13:28,428
Ha ha ha!

1421
01:13:28,496 --> 01:13:30,329
Gay, you're
wonderful.

1422
01:13:33,101 --> 01:13:34,602
Gay just
can't lose.

1423
01:13:34,670 --> 01:13:36,571
What's good
in the next race?

1424
01:13:51,017 --> 01:13:51,951
[Honk honk]

1425
01:13:52,018 --> 01:13:53,751

1426
01:13:58,224 --> 01:13:59,858
[Honk honk]

1427
01:14:01,226 --> 01:14:03,594
Ha ha ha!

1428
01:14:03,661 --> 01:14:05,996
There isn't anything
i haven't got...

1429
01:14:06,064 --> 01:14:07,664
nothing left
to wish for.

1430
01:14:07,732 --> 01:14:09,799
We've been through
some pretty hard times.

1431
01:14:09,867 --> 01:14:12,268
Might just as well
enjoy the good times.

1432
01:14:12,336 --> 01:14:14,504
[Bang]

1433
01:14:14,571 --> 01:14:16,471
Something must
be wrong, darling.

1434
01:14:16,539 --> 01:14:18,173
Ha ha ha!

1435
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:21,243
"We may move
to a large apartment.

1436
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:24,011
We need more room,"
and so and so and so.

1437
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:25,412
What was all that?

1438
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:27,681
Nothing. Just that
they don't like it

1439
01:14:27,749 --> 01:14:29,350
at the palmer house
anymore.

1440
01:14:29,417 --> 01:14:31,352
Ain't you going to
read it to me?

1441
01:14:31,419 --> 01:14:34,988
Oh, yes.
"We're placing kim
in a convent school."

1442
01:14:35,055 --> 01:14:37,757
It will
cost them a fortune.
Why did they do that?

1443
01:14:37,825 --> 01:14:40,259
"Gay thinks kim
will have a chance

1444
01:14:40,326 --> 01:14:42,394
to form better
social connections."

1445
01:14:42,462 --> 01:14:45,130
Public school is the best,
but not for gay and nola.

1446
01:14:45,198 --> 01:14:47,498
Nothing's any good for them
unless it costs a lot.

1447
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:51,202
Did he buy her any
new diamond bracelets
or automobiles?

1448
01:14:51,270 --> 01:14:52,703
She don't say.

1449
01:14:52,771 --> 01:14:54,038
Well, what
does she say?

1450
01:14:54,106 --> 01:14:55,805
"I hope
you and mother
are well,"

1451
01:14:55,873 --> 01:14:57,440
and so and so
and so.

1452
01:14:57,508 --> 01:14:59,142
"Give my regards
to joe and queenie,

1453
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:01,811
and don't forget"...
so and so and so.

1454
01:15:01,879 --> 01:15:03,612
"Hasn't the weather
been fine?"

1455
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:05,614
So and so
and so and so.

1456
01:15:05,682 --> 01:15:07,249
"Your loving
daughter, noli."

1457
01:15:07,317 --> 01:15:08,851
Very inter

1458
01:15:08,919 --> 01:15:10,619
you know what i'd
like to do, parthy?

1459
01:15:10,687 --> 01:15:11,819
No.

1460
01:15:11,887 --> 01:15:13,721
After we put up
the show boat
for the winter,

1461
01:15:13,789 --> 01:15:16,090
how about you and me
making a trip
up there?

1462
01:15:16,158 --> 01:15:18,393
Chicago?
You must be crazy.

1463
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:20,227
Well, i've got
a kind of a feeling

1464
01:15:20,295 --> 01:15:22,429
i'd like to see
noli and gay.

1465
01:15:22,497 --> 01:15:25,766
I don't care
to see gay again
as long as i live.

1466
01:15:25,833 --> 01:15:27,433
He's a wastrel,
an adventurer,

1467
01:15:27,501 --> 01:15:29,969
a cheap river gambler
with a high and mighty air,

1468
01:15:30,037 --> 01:15:31,304
and mark my words...

1469
01:15:31,371 --> 01:15:32,305
shh shh shh!

1470
01:15:32,372 --> 01:15:34,739
We ain't seen kim
in a long while.

1471
01:15:34,807 --> 01:15:36,641
She must be getting
kind of big.

1472
01:15:36,709 --> 01:15:38,977
Smart as a whip,
too, i guess.

1473
01:15:39,045 --> 01:15:42,780
Did i show you
those crayon pictures
she sent me last week?

1474
01:15:42,847 --> 01:15:45,282
Teddy roosevelt
and the one
of the battleship?

1475
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:47,084
Hee hee hee!
I seen them.

1476
01:15:47,152 --> 01:15:48,752
Oh, she's smart,
all right.

1477
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:49,820
Yes.

1478
01:15:49,888 --> 01:15:51,521
Come on.
Let's you and me
make the trip.

1479
01:15:51,589 --> 01:15:55,558
You can bake a cake
and bring it to her
up to the school.

1480
01:15:55,626 --> 01:15:56,993
Huh?

1481
01:15:57,961 --> 01:16:00,262
Well... maybe.

1482
01:16:03,933 --> 01:16:06,300
You won't find
another room like this
at the price.

1483
01:16:06,368 --> 01:16:09,470
Well, anyway,
it's chicago, kiddo.

1484
01:16:09,538 --> 01:16:11,472
Looks like somebody's
living in it.

1485
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:13,907
Well, they won't be
after this morning.

1486
01:16:13,975 --> 01:16:16,509
12 solid weeks
gone by

1487
01:16:16,577 --> 01:16:18,612
and not
a penny paid.

1488
01:16:18,679 --> 01:16:22,181
No, ma'am,
i have me own bills.

1489
01:16:26,252 --> 01:16:28,387
Is that you,
nola?

1490
01:16:28,455 --> 01:16:30,388
Elly.

1491
01:16:30,456 --> 01:16:32,023
That's right.

1492
01:16:32,091 --> 01:16:35,259
Elly! Oh!

1493
01:16:35,327 --> 01:16:36,761
Hello, nola.

1494
01:16:36,829 --> 01:16:37,761
And frank!

1495
01:16:37,829 --> 01:16:39,396
Oh, noli.

1496
01:16:39,464 --> 01:16:40,897
How did you find me?

1497
01:16:40,965 --> 01:16:42,265
Well...

1498
01:16:42,333 --> 01:16:44,301
they came to look
for rooms,

1499
01:16:44,369 --> 01:16:46,669
and i told them
you were leaving.

1500
01:16:46,737 --> 01:16:48,704
Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.

1501
01:16:48,772 --> 01:16:50,673
You see, these were
only temporary quarters

1502
01:16:50,741 --> 01:16:53,241
until we move
into our new home
on the lake shore.

1503
01:16:53,309 --> 01:16:55,243
Meanwhile,
we stopped here.

1504
01:16:55,311 --> 01:16:57,412
It's near gay's
business, and then...

1505
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,748
we like to help out
mrs. O'brien.

1506
01:16:59,815 --> 01:17:02,249
Huh! Great help.

1507
01:17:02,317 --> 01:17:03,751
I'll be going
downstairs.

1508
01:17:03,818 --> 01:17:06,086
You can let me know
about the room.

1509
01:17:06,154 --> 01:17:09,889
Huh! Helping out
mrs. O'brien!

1510

[Mrs. O'brien grumbling]

1511
01:17:11,592 --> 01:17:15,261
Oh, she's
a dear old thing.

1512
01:17:15,329 --> 01:17:17,929
Why, nola, is this
your little girl's picture?

1513
01:17:17,997 --> 01:17:20,198
Yes, that's kim.
Isn't she a darling?

1514
01:17:20,266 --> 01:17:22,601
She's
at the convent...
saint agatha's.

1515
01:17:22,669 --> 01:17:24,301
Gay insisted
on giving her

1516
01:17:24,369 --> 01:17:25,803
every possible
advantage.

1517
01:17:25,871 --> 01:17:27,505
Gay doing well,
noli?

1518
01:17:27,572 --> 01:17:29,106
Oh, yes, yes.

1519
01:17:29,174 --> 01:17:31,875
He's a big success.

1520
01:17:31,942 --> 01:17:34,811
Well, sit down.
Tell me something
about yourselves.

1521
01:17:34,879 --> 01:17:36,780
Oh, we're doing
pretty good.

1522
01:17:36,847 --> 01:17:38,815
Ooh!

1523
01:17:38,883 --> 01:17:40,849
We're kind of
breaking in
a new act.

1524
01:17:40,917 --> 01:17:43,285
We open
new year's eve
at the trocadero.

1525
01:17:43,353 --> 01:17:45,320
I was thinking,
if you needed money,

1526
01:17:45,388 --> 01:17:48,356
i could
fix you up a job.
Maybe a little act...

1527
01:17:48,424 --> 01:17:50,391
singing,
playing the banjo,
like you used to.

1528
01:17:50,459 --> 01:17:51,993
Oh, that would
be fine, nola.

1529
01:17:52,061 --> 01:17:53,628
Gay would never
hear of it.

1530
01:17:53,696 --> 01:17:56,196
Of course, i'd like to...
just as a lark, i mean.

1531
01:17:56,264 --> 01:17:57,731
I don't need the money.

1532
01:17:57,799 --> 01:17:59,232
No,
of course not.

1533
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:00,901
[Knock on door]

1534
01:18:00,968 --> 01:18:02,202
Come in.

1535
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:05,504
A boy left
this for you,
mrs. Ravenal.

1536
01:18:05,572 --> 01:18:07,540
Thank you, ethel.

1537
01:18:11,043 --> 01:18:14,245
Oh, yes. G must have
stopped at the bank.

1538
01:18:14,313 --> 01:18:16,114
I've got to see
what gay says.

1539
01:18:16,182 --> 01:18:18,416
He may want me
to meet him somewhere.

1540
01:18:30,794 --> 01:18:33,196
Tell me, dear,
what's the matter?

1541
01:18:33,263 --> 01:18:34,896
Is gay hurt?

1542
01:18:34,964 --> 01:18:36,932
No.

1543
01:18:36,999 --> 01:18:38,500
Elly, you read it.

1544
01:18:38,568 --> 01:18:40,202
I may believe it

1545
01:18:40,269 --> 01:18:43,838
if i hear
somebody else say it.

1546
01:18:43,905 --> 01:18:45,072

01:18:51,979 --> 01:18:54,013
"There's nothing
left to pawn

1551
01:18:54,081 --> 01:18:57,783
"and no more friends
to borrow from.

1552
01:18:57,851 --> 01:19:00,085
"I am enclosing
$200.

1553
01:19:00,153 --> 01:19:03,388
"This will let kim
finish her term
at the convent.

1554
01:19:03,456 --> 01:19:06,624
"Then you can both
go to your parents.

1555
01:19:06,692 --> 01:19:10,094
"I am doing this
because i love you.

1556
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:14,097
"Please believe
i will always
love you,

1557
01:19:14,165 --> 01:19:16,233
"my dear
little wife.

1558
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:17,934
"Good-bye.

1559
01:19:18,002 --> 01:19:21,270
Your own, gay."

1560
01:19:23,707 --> 01:19:28,477
Oh, nola.
Is there anything
we can do, nola?

1561
01:19:28,545 --> 01:19:30,779
I don't think so, elly.

1562
01:19:30,846 --> 01:19:34,849
I don't know. I never thought
of living without gay,

1563
01:19:34,917 --> 01:19:37,317
no matter what happened.

1564
01:19:37,385 --> 01:19:39,753
I can't imagine it now.

1565
01:19:39,821 --> 01:19:42,489
He seems to think
you and kim will be
better off.

1566
01:19:42,557 --> 01:19:46,025
Better off?
I never complained.

1567
01:19:46,093 --> 01:19:48,528
I've lived like this
half the time.

1568
01:19:48,595 --> 01:19:53,899
One room, one bed,
washing clothes in a basin,

1569
01:19:53,966 --> 01:19:57,035
cooking food
over a gas jet,

1570
01:19:57,103 --> 01:19:58,937
but i loved him,

1571
01:19:59,005 --> 01:20:03,240
and if all that went with him,
i was willing to take it.

1572
01:20:03,308 --> 01:20:05,543
I thought he knew that.

1573
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:07,278
Look, deary,
you and kim

1574
01:20:07,345 --> 01:20:09,946
can have a good home
on the show boat.

1575
01:20:10,014 --> 01:20:11,414
Good home?

1576
01:20:11,482 --> 01:20:13,817
Living on charity
and having my mother tell me

1577
01:20:13,884 --> 01:20:16,318
she always knew
it would be like this,

1578
01:20:16,386 --> 01:20:18,187
the whole show boat troupe

1579
01:20:18,254 --> 01:20:20,455
whispering about me
in their dressing rooms...

1580
01:20:20,523 --> 01:20:23,692
no. I'll do anything
but that.

1581
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,193
Won't it cost you
something

1582
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:26,661
to keep the kid
at the convent?

1583
01:20:26,728 --> 01:20:30,031
This money will help me
for a month or so.

1584
01:20:30,098 --> 01:20:31,965
Meanwhile,
i'll look for work.

1585
01:20:32,033 --> 01:20:34,000
Well, don't forget
what i said

1586
01:20:34,068 --> 01:20:36,236
about the trocadero.

1587
01:20:36,304 --> 01:20:37,971
The troca...

1588
01:20:38,039 --> 01:20:42,408
oh, yes. I might
try that, frank.

1589
01:20:42,475 --> 01:20:44,310
I'll think it over.

1590
01:20:44,377 --> 01:20:46,979
You'd like us to go,
wouldn't you, dear?

1591
01:20:47,047 --> 01:20:49,113
Sure. Sure, noli.

Elly and i 23.

1593
01:20:52,985 --> 01:20:56,386
You can get us
over at forbes hotel
if you want us.

1594
01:20:56,454 --> 01:20:58,522
All right, dear.

1595
01:21:12,635 --> 01:21:13,602
Oh!

1596
01:21:13,669 --> 01:21:15,103
[Crying]

1597
01:21:19,608 --> 01:21:21,475
[Singing]

1598
01:21:31,652 --> 01:21:33,219
Your daughter's
class

1599
01:21:33,287 --> 01:21:35,554
will be coming
through next.

1600
01:21:39,025 --> 01:21:40,359
Kim.

1601
01:21:40,426 --> 01:21:42,193
Daddy!

1602
01:21:51,102 --> 01:21:53,036
Where's mom?

1603
01:21:56,908 --> 01:21:59,408
Mother couldn't
come today, dear.

1604
01:21:59,476 --> 01:22:01,110
Now listen,
kim, dear.

1605
01:22:01,177 --> 01:22:02,511
Daddy's in
a great hurry.

1606
01:22:02,579 --> 01:22:04,013
He must
catch a train.

1607
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,080
Where are you going?

1608
01:22:05,148 --> 01:22:08,283
Away for a little while
on business.

1609
01:22:08,350 --> 01:22:11,286
I just had a few minutes
to rush in and see you.

1610
01:22:11,353 --> 01:22:12,754
Can i go with you?

1611
01:22:12,821 --> 01:22:14,288
No, darling...

1612
01:22:15,857 --> 01:22:18,058

1613
01:22:18,126 --> 01:22:19,993
And when i'm gone,

1614
01:22:20,061 --> 01:22:23,162
i want you

once in a while.

1615
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:24,630
Will you?

1616
01:22:24,698 --> 01:22:26,899
Yes. I think of you
all the time,

1617
01:22:26,967 --> 01:22:28,401
and when i miss you,

1618
01:22:28,468 --> 01:22:29,868
i always do
what you told me.

1619
01:22:29,936 --> 01:22:31,136
What was that?

1620
01:22:31,203 --> 01:22:34,439
Don't you remember?
Make believe.

1621
01:22:34,507 --> 01:22:36,941
Oh, yes.
That's right.

1622
01:22:37,008 --> 01:22:38,943
I gave you a system

1623
01:22:39,010 --> 01:22:40,811
for having
everything you want.

1624
01:22:40,879 --> 01:22:48,751
¶ only make believe

1625
01:22:48,819 --> 01:22:55,424
¶ only make believe
that you're with me ¶

01:22:55,491 --> 01:22:57,025
¶ girls and boys ¶

01:22:57,093 --> 01:23:01,662
¶ find it fun
just pretending ¶

1628
01:23:01,730 --> 01:23:07,368
¶ couldn't you?
Couldn't i? ¶

1629
01:23:07,436 --> 01:23:12,272
¶ couldn't we? ¶

1630
01:23:15,176 --> 01:23:18,477
and if i'm

01:23:18,545 --> 01:23:20,145

1632
01:23:20,213 --> 01:23:23,815
and pretend
that i've never

1633
01:23:23,882 --> 01:23:27,318
Will you,
sweetheart?

1634
01:23:27,386 --> 01:23:36,793
¶ best of all,

i love you ¶

1635
01:23:36,861 --> 01:23:42,465

Good-bye, darling.

1639
01:23:58,813 --> 01:24:00,614
Good-bye, daddy.

1640
01:24:01,549 --> 01:24:03,016
Kim.

1641
01:24:04,551 --> 01:24:05,952
Be sure to tell
your mother

1642
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:07,754
that i came
to see you.

1643
01:24:07,821 --> 01:24:09,288
Will you,
sweetheart?

1644
01:24:09,356 --> 01:24:11,456
All right, daddy.
I'll tell her.

1645
01:24:20,198 --> 01:24:22,299
Say, where
are you going?

1646
01:24:22,367 --> 01:24:23,768
I want to see
mr. Green.

1647
01:24:23,835 --> 01:24:25,336
Can't see him now.
Rehearsal.

1648
01:24:25,404 --> 01:24:27,003
He told me not to
let anybody in.

1649
01:24:27,071 --> 01:24:28,405
Can we wait
out here?

1650
01:24:28,472 --> 01:24:30,940
Sure, but don't walk
on the wet floor.

1651
01:24:31,008 --> 01:24:33,276
Oh. Come on, noli.
Sit down over here.

1652
01:25:19,050 --> 01:25:20,717
All right, jake.
Call them at 12:00.

1653
01:25:20,785 --> 01:25:22,652
[Man]
O.k., girls,
12:00 tomorrow.

1654
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:24,720
Come on, julie.
Let's hear the new song.

1655
01:25:24,788 --> 01:25:26,622
I don't feel like
singing.

1656
01:25:26,690 --> 01:25:28,157
Oh, don't you?

1657
01:25:28,225 --> 01:25:30,192
What do you
feel like doing,
duchess?

1658
01:25:30,259 --> 01:25:32,427
I feel like
going off on a tear.

1659
01:25:32,495 --> 01:25:34,496
Come on, julie.
Let mr. Green hear the song.

1660
01:25:34,564 --> 01:25:36,198
Come on, julie.

1661
01:25:37,532 --> 01:25:39,700
It's a good one,
mr. Green.

1662
01:25:46,373 --> 01:25:51,010
¶ i used to dream
that i would
discover ¶

1663
01:25:51,078 --> 01:25:54,680
¶ the perfect
lover someday ¶

1664
01:25:54,747 --> 01:25:57,516
¶ i knew
i'd recognize him ¶

1665
01:25:57,584 --> 01:26:03,187
¶ if ever
he came round
my way ¶

1666
01:26:03,255 --> 01:26:07,024
¶ and i always
used to fancy then ¶

1667
01:26:07,092 --> 01:26:12,796
¶ he'd be one
of the godlike
kind of men ¶

1668
01:26:12,864 --> 01:26:18,033
¶ with a giant brain
and a noble head ¶

1669
01:26:18,101 --> 01:26:21,470
¶ like the heroes
bold ¶

1670
01:26:21,538 --> 01:26:25,907
¶ in the books
i've read ¶

1671
01:26:25,975 --> 01:26:29,644
¶ but along came bill ¶

1672
01:26:29,712 --> 01:26:32,980
¶ who's not
that type at all ¶

1673
01:26:33,047 --> 01:26:35,149
¶ you'd meet him
on the street ¶

1674
01:26:35,216 --> 01:26:37,451
¶ and never notice him ¶

1675
01:26:37,519 --> 01:26:40,486
¶ his form and face ¶

1676
01:26:40,554 --> 01:26:43,489
¶ his manly grace ¶

1677
01:26:43,557 --> 01:26:46,993
¶ are not
the kind that you ¶

1678
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:50,962
¶ would find
in a statue ¶

1679
01:26:51,030 --> 01:26:54,965
¶ oh, i can't explain ¶

1680
01:26:55,033 --> 01:26:58,502
¶ it's surely not
his brain ¶

1681
01:26:58,570 --> 01:27:03,873
¶ that makes me thrill ¶

1682
01:27:03,941 --> 01:27:08,511
¶ i love him ¶

1683
01:27:08,579 --> 01:27:13,015
¶ because he's
wonderful ¶

1684
01:27:13,082 --> 01:27:20,555
¶ because he's
just my bill ¶

1685
01:27:20,622 --> 01:27:24,926
¶ he can't play golf
or tennis or polo ¶

1686
01:27:24,993 --> 01:27:28,395
¶ or sing a solo
or row ¶

1687
01:27:28,462 --> 01:27:31,264
¶ he isn't
half as handsome ¶

1688
01:27:31,332 --> 01:27:36,869
¶ as dozens of men
that i know ¶

1689
01:27:36,937 --> 01:27:41,840
¶ he isn't tall
or straight or slim ¶

1690
01:27:41,907 --> 01:27:48,913
¶ and he dresses far worse
than ted or jim ¶

1691
01:27:48,981 --> 01:27:55,886
¶ i can't explain
why he should be ¶

1692
01:27:55,954 --> 01:28:04,694
¶ just the one, one man
in the world for me ¶

1693
01:28:04,761 --> 01:28:09,464
¶ he's just my bill ¶

1694
01:28:09,532 --> 01:28:13,467
¶ an ordinary man ¶

1695
01:28:13,535 --> 01:28:19,440
¶ he hasn't got a thing
that i can brag about ¶

1696
01:28:19,507 --> 01:28:25,378
¶ and yet to be
upon his knee ¶

1697
01:28:25,446 --> 01:28:33,085
¶ so comfy and roomy,
seems natural to me ¶

1698
01:28:33,152 --> 01:28:37,421
¶ oh, i can't explain ¶

1699
01:28:37,489 --> 01:28:41,259
¶ it's surely not
his brain ¶

1700
01:28:41,326 --> 01:28:47,530
¶ that makes me thrill ¶

1701
01:28:47,598 --> 01:28:52,901
¶ i love him ¶

1702
01:28:52,969 --> 01:28:58,207
¶ because he's,
i don't know ¶

1703
01:28:58,275 --> 01:29:07,382
¶ because he's
just my bill ¶

1704
01:29:10,918 --> 01:29:12,586
use it tomorrow night,

1705
01:29:12,654 --> 01:29:14,354
and listen...
be sober.

1706
01:29:14,422 --> 01:29:15,855
I'll be sober.

1707
01:29:15,922 --> 01:29:19,492
If you want me,
i'll be in my
dressing room.

1708
01:29:20,827 --> 01:29:23,828
Queer how a woman
goes all to pieces
over a man.

1709
01:29:23,896 --> 01:29:26,231
She was the best bet
in chicago

1710
01:29:26,299 --> 01:29:29,134
till that big,
curly-haired tramp
threw her down.

1711
01:29:29,201 --> 01:29:31,069
Want to go
to radley's
for a drink?

1712
01:29:31,137 --> 01:29:32,569
Yeah. Thanks, boss.

1713
01:29:32,637 --> 01:29:34,438
O.k., kids!
See you tomorrow!

1714
01:29:38,677 --> 01:29:40,576
Mr. Green,
can i see you a minute?

1715
01:29:40,644 --> 01:29:42,078
I'm frank schultz
of schultz and schultz,

1716
01:29:42,146 --> 01:29:43,613
the well-known
comedy team.

1717
01:29:43,681 --> 01:29:45,381
The new act, huh?

1718
01:29:45,449 --> 01:29:46,883
I'll see you later.

1719
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:48,083
I want to see you...

1720
01:29:48,151 --> 01:29:49,618
what do you want?

1721
01:29:49,686 --> 01:29:51,620
I got a girl
i want you
to hear sing.

1722
01:29:51,688 --> 01:29:53,121
I ain't seeing
no more people today.

1723
01:29:53,189 --> 01:29:54,556
I thought...

1724
01:29:54,624 --> 01:29:57,591
you thought wrong!
You thought wrong!

1725
01:29:57,659 --> 01:29:59,126
Who do you
want to see?

1726
01:29:59,194 --> 01:30:00,428
Well, l...

1727
01:30:00,495 --> 01:30:01,962
that's the girl
i mean, mr. Green.

1728
01:30:02,030 --> 01:30:03,830
I'd like to sing
for you, mr. Green.

1729
01:30:03,898 --> 01:30:05,765
Yeah? What kind
of singing?

1730
01:30:05,833 --> 01:30:07,167
I do negro songs.

1731
01:30:07,234 --> 01:30:10,103
Oh, coon-shouter, huh?

1732
01:30:11,171 --> 01:30:13,138
All right, let's see
what you can do.

1733
01:30:13,206 --> 01:30:14,907
Oh, come on, noli.

1734
01:30:17,043 --> 01:30:18,576
Hold that!

1735
01:30:18,644 --> 01:30:20,611
Couple of chairs.

1736
01:30:24,149 --> 01:30:25,817
Take off
your hat.

1737
01:30:26,984 --> 01:30:31,888
¶ fish gotta swim
and birds gotta fly ¶

1738

¶ i gotta love one man

1739
01:30:36,159 --> 01:30:38,094
here you are,
miss julie.

1740
01:30:38,161 --> 01:30:39,595
You got 15 cents
coming to you.

1741
01:30:39,663 --> 01:30:41,097
Keep it.

1742
01:30:41,164 --> 01:30:42,597
Thank you.

1743
01:30:42,665 --> 01:30:44,566
Wait, sam. Who is
that girl singing?

1744
01:30:44,633 --> 01:30:46,601
Don't know. Must need
a job awful bad.

1745
01:30:46,669 --> 01:30:48,970
Been sitting
on those steps
most of the morning.

1746
01:30:49,038 --> 01:30:52,840
¶ tell me he's lazy,
tell me he's slow ¶

1747

1749
01:30:59,747 --> 01:31:01,547
Do you know her?

1750
01:31:01,615 --> 01:31:03,516
I used to.

1751
01:31:03,584 --> 01:31:07,486
She's singing
one of the songs
i taught her.

1752
01:31:09,255 --> 01:31:11,623
¶ when he goes away ¶

1753
01:31:11,691 --> 01:31:15,993
she was the sweetest kid
i ever knew.

1754
01:31:16,061 --> 01:31:18,863
That her?
Shall i tell her
you're here?

1755
01:31:18,930 --> 01:31:20,364
No, no, no,
sam, no.

1756
01:31:20,432 --> 01:31:21,831
Well,
if she gets
the job...

1757
01:31:21,899 --> 01:31:23,333
she can't!

1758
01:31:23,401 --> 01:31:25,935
Green only uses
one singer in the show,
and that's me.

1759
01:31:26,003 --> 01:31:28,338
¶ that day is fine ¶

1760
01:31:28,406 --> 01:31:30,072
i wonder...

1761
01:31:30,140 --> 01:31:33,008
i wonder how bad
she needs a job.

1762
01:31:34,210 --> 01:31:39,514
¶ he can come home
as late as can be ¶

1763
01:31:39,581 --> 01:31:45,452
¶ home without him

1764
01:31:45,520 --> 01:32:02,033
¶ can't help lovin'

1765
01:32:02,101 --> 01:32:03,268
what do you say,
boss?

1766
01:32:03,335 --> 01:32:05,103
Rotten.

1767
01:32:05,171 --> 01:32:07,639
Why, that song is the most
beautiful song i know,

1768
01:32:07,706 --> 01:32:09,907
and if you don't like it,
i'm sorry for you!

1769
01:32:09,974 --> 01:32:11,141
Mr. Green.

1770
01:32:11,209 --> 01:32:12,643
Well, what do you want?

1771
01:32:12,710 --> 01:32:15,078
Got a message
for you from your
prima donna.

1772
01:32:15,146 --> 01:32:17,447
She said to tell you
she's leaving
your show flat.

1773
01:32:17,514 --> 01:32:18,881
Where is she?

1774
01:32:18,949 --> 01:32:20,383
Just went off
in a cab.

1775
01:32:20,451 --> 01:32:22,084
She's gone off
on one of her
sprees.

1776
01:32:23,653 --> 01:32:25,120
She won't be fit
for anything

1777
01:32:25,188 --> 01:32:26,621
for a week,
let alone tomorrow night.

1778
01:32:26,689 --> 01:32:28,290
Oh, why didn't you
stop her?

1779
01:32:28,357 --> 01:32:31,026
Say, i'm a doorman,
not a nursemaid.

1780
01:32:31,093 --> 01:32:33,127
It's enough
to drive a man crazy.

1781
01:32:33,195 --> 01:32:34,762
That settles it.
She's through!

1782
01:32:34,830 --> 01:32:37,131
Said to tell you,
if you want a girl
to fill her place,

1783
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:39,199
you better
grab the one
that just sung.

1784
01:32:39,266 --> 01:32:40,600
Can't you use her?

1785
01:32:40,668 --> 01:32:42,635
I can't afford
to take chances

1786
01:32:42,703 --> 01:32:45,138
with amateurs
on a $2,000 production.

1787
01:32:45,206 --> 01:32:46,639
Now, wait a minute,
will you?

1788
01:32:46,707 --> 01:32:48,340
Let me think.

1789
01:32:51,711 --> 01:32:54,179
Her personality
is all right.

1790
01:32:54,247 --> 01:32:55,680
If we could
only teach her

1791
01:32:55,747 --> 01:32:57,181
some up-to-date
numbers.

1792
01:32:57,249 --> 01:32:58,683
That song she sang
ain't bad, boss,

1793
01:32:58,750 --> 01:33:00,918
but we could
trick that like this.

1794
01:33:00,986 --> 01:33:03,053
¶ wot dot da,

1795
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,221

1797
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:07,657
Yeah. We got to change
the words, too, see,

1798
01:33:07,725 --> 01:33:10,026
and at the finish, put in
a couple of gags like this.

1799
01:33:10,094 --> 01:33:11,527
¶ bot dot da,

1800
01:33:11,595 --> 01:33:12,661

1801
01:33:12,729 --> 01:33:14,363
¶ bot dot da,

1802
01:33:14,431 --> 01:33:16,198
another catch line.
See what i mean?

1803
01:33:16,266 --> 01:33:17,533
Say, that's
all right.

1804
01:33:17,601 --> 01:33:20,502
Noli, try it this way.
Follow jake.

1805
01:33:20,569 --> 01:33:23,137
¶ fish gotta swim,

1806
01:33:23,205 --> 01:33:26,139
no, no!
Rag it, he means.

1807
01:33:26,207 --> 01:33:27,508
Rag it, honey. Look.

No, i won't.

stand here all night?

Come on. Let's go out
and find them.

for a needle
in a haystack.

2067
01:48:37,068 --> 01:48:38,502
It was
such dreadful fog,

2068
01:48:38,569 --> 01:48:41,004
but not as bad
as it is in europe.

2069
01:48:41,072 --> 01:48:43,239
You know...
thank you.

2070
01:48:49,912 --> 01:48:51,313
Oh, my.
There's kim.

2071
01:48:55,518 --> 01:48:58,018
Go on, go on.
Ch-ch-ch-ch!

2072
01:48:58,086 --> 01:49:00,220
Come this way.

2073
01:49:03,625 --> 01:49:05,525
What are you
doing here?

2074
01:49:05,592 --> 01:49:07,493
I just wanted to see
the one number, sir.

2075
01:49:07,561 --> 01:49:09,462
Why, that's the most
outrageous thing
i ever heard.

2076
01:49:09,530 --> 01:49:10,830
Go back
to the stage door.

2077
01:49:10,898 --> 01:49:12,998
Come to the office
in the morning
to get your pay.

2078
01:49:13,066 --> 01:49:14,466
You're fired.

2079
01:49:14,534 --> 01:49:16,001
Here, sir.

2080
01:49:16,069 --> 01:49:17,636
Right in here.
This is your box.

2081
01:49:17,704 --> 01:49:19,805
Gay.

2082
01:49:25,544 --> 01:49:27,478
Gay.

2083
01:49:28,412 --> 01:49:30,480
Don't you
recognize me?

2084
01:49:30,548 --> 01:49:32,615
You haven't
changed much, nola.

2085
01:49:35,553 --> 01:49:37,019
Oh...

2086
01:49:37,087 --> 01:49:39,488
wouldn't you like
to come in here with us?

2087
01:49:39,556 --> 01:49:41,523
I think we...

2088
01:49:41,591 --> 01:49:43,025
well...

2089
01:49:43,093 --> 01:49:45,326
this is our
daughter's big night.

2090
01:49:46,328 --> 01:49:48,563
Sure,
why don't you?

2091
01:50:34,570 --> 01:50:37,539
I didn't mean
to come back
into your life.

2092
01:50:37,607 --> 01:50:39,540
I don't want you
to forgive me,

2093
01:50:39,608 --> 01:50:41,008
because i don't
deserve it.

2094
01:50:41,076 --> 01:50:42,543
Just let me...

2095
01:50:42,611 --> 01:50:44,278
slip out.

2096
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:47,080
Gay.

2097
01:50:50,184 --> 01:50:52,519
There's another ravenal
in the house tonight...

2098
01:50:52,586 --> 01:50:54,420
magnolia.

2099
01:50:56,055 --> 01:50:57,556
Noli.

2100
01:50:57,624 --> 01:50:59,291
Noli.

2101
01:51:05,464 --> 01:51:07,064
Maybe she'll take
my encore for me.

2102
01:51:07,132 --> 01:51:08,666
How about it, mother?

2103
01:51:08,734 --> 01:51:11,368
<i>Please play
you are love.</i>

2104
01:51:11,436 --> 01:51:13,603
[Orchestra playing]

2105
01:51:16,574 --> 01:51:18,507
Give them
the smile, noli.

2106
01:51:18,575 --> 01:51:19,975
Give them the smile.

2107
01:51:20,043 --> 01:51:21,477
I think
she likes this better

2108
01:51:21,545 --> 01:51:23,045
than any song
she knows.

2109
01:51:23,113 --> 01:51:30,385
¶ you are love
here in my arms ¶

2110
01:51:30,453 --> 01:51:33,554
¶ where you belong ¶

2111
01:51:33,621 --> 01:51:38,892
¶ and here you will stay ¶

2112
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:43,329
¶ i'll not let you away ¶

2113
01:51:43,397 --> 01:51:50,902
¶ i want day after day
with you ¶

2114
01:51:50,970 --> 01:51:56,408
¶ you are spring ¶

2115
01:51:56,476 --> 01:52:00,978
¶ bud of romance unfurled ¶

2116
01:52:01,046 --> 01:52:04,048
there's another
ravenal here tonight...

2117
01:52:04,115 --> 01:52:05,548
gaylord ravenal,

2118
01:52:05,616 --> 01:52:07,517
my first leading man.

2119
01:52:10,621 --> 01:52:12,821
[Applause]

2120
01:52:18,194 --> 01:52:22,463
¶ where you go with me ¶

2121
01:52:22,531 --> 01:52:35,876
¶ heaven will always be ¶

2122
01:52:35,943 --> 01:52:39,812
[joe]
¶ that ol' man river ¶

2123
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:51,022
¶ he just keeps rollin' along ¶
