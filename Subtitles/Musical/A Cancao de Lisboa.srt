Lisbon
City that enthrals me

12
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,300
City of songs

13
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,400

Songs for all

16
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,400

In a sad endless farewell

City of Love

21
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,400
Beckoning and seducing us all

22
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,300
The sky is even deeper in hue

23
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,500
And the sun shines brighter

24
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,200
The streets seem to hum in joy

25
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,100
The city awakens singing

26
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,100
And uplifting is the melody

27
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Of your early rising

28
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,900
Your charm and splendour

29
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,700
Are unparalleled in the world

30
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,400

You'll flunk, lazybones

33
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,800
You'll flunk your final exam

34
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,200
You'll see, Leitão, you lazybones

35
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,500
You'll flunk your final exam

36
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,000
You'll see, lazybones
You shall flunk.

37
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,200
5th year.
Medical Practice Examination.

38
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,300
Sebastião da Costa Valente.
Valente? (Valiant)

39
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,400
That's me.

40
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,200
Teófilo das Neves Claro.
Claro? (White)

41
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,500
Here.

42
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm going to this exam without
a clear thought in my head.

43
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,800
But I see them pretty dark indeed.

44
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,300
May St. Francis Xavier help me.

45
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,000
- Vasco Leitão.
- At your command, General.

46
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,600
- May the gentle St. Francis help me.
- Good Luck, Vasco, my lad.

47
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,500
So you're saying that water
in the belly is Pott's Disease

48
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,000
and you advise an injection?!

49
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,500
What?! An injection?

50
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,200
Do you know what happens if you stick
a needle in the diaphragm?

51
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
You shall not touch it!

52
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Sorry, but if I stick a needle there,
I assure you I'll touch it.

53
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:03,100
You just mentioned bicarbonate
for varicose veins.

54
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,800
- By Jove!
- Sorry! But I said benzonaphthol.

55
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,200
''Vasco Leitão...

56
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,900
...Failed''

57
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,300
''Trás-os-Montes, 20th June,

58
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,800
1933. Tua.''

59
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,100
''My Dear Vasco,

60
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,000
''I hope that this letter finds you
in good health.''

61
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,800
You said in your last letter

62
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,400
that you passed your exam
with flying colours,

63
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,200
and that you are now a doctor.

64
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,800
And also that you have set
a superb office.

65
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,500
Let me turn the page, sister, please.

66
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,200
Fortunately, our money
has been put to good use.

67
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,700
As we know you would never deceive
your aunts,

68
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,200
we have decided to go
and celebrate your success,

69
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,900
and also get to know Lisbon,
a city we have never seen.

70
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,300
Sister, please, have a heart,
don't rush me.

71
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,400
Now, you were saying...

72
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,200
We can even picture

73
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,400
your face lighting up with joy.

74
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,200
''Best regards from us all.

75
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,000
''We shall arrive on Saturday
at 12:40H.

76
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:47,200
''Your loving aunts,
Efigénia and Perpétua Rocha.''

77
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,800
You scared me, man. Sit down.
What do you think of this?

78
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,700
Such a big fib.
And what a mess you're in.

79
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,600
Thank you.

80
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,400
I'm coming, I won't be a moment.

81
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,900
Hello, my pretty flower.

82
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,500
Hello, neighbour.
You look very happy!

83
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,800
Things are going very well for me.

84
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,900
- Did you do your exam?
- I did. I got 20.

85
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,100
Congratulations.

86
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,100
I got 20 minutes of cross-examination
as if I were in Prison.

87
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,400
And in the end?

88
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,400
Failed. It has upset me so!

89
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,100
You haven't lost any weight over it
though.

90
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,100
Not everyone can be as you are,
Maria da Graça. Such a supple figure.

91
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,900
You're the pin-up
of our neighbourhood.

92
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,800
From now on I shall call you the Greta
Garbo of Castelinhos neighbourhood.

93
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,600
How nice!
And what shall I call you?

94
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,400
Call me whatever you want.
Call me something sweet.

95
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,400
Call me Bibi or Lulu.

96
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,800
Call me...

97
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,600
Call me whenever you like
and I shall go straight to you.

98
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
Be serious.

99
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,100
Bye-bye.
Granny's little treasure.

100
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,700
Well, courting the charming singer?

101
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,400
Then you tell me I'm your only love
and that your fate is to be with me.

102
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,000
Don't be so mean to me.

103
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,100
Traitor, liar. You think you're
a big lady-killer, don't you?

104
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,700
If what I say isn't true,
let my head be chopped off.

105
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,500
I'm stuck.

106
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,300
My father's right, he says you're
a liar, a cheat, a rogue and stuck up.

107
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,800
Stuck up? I wish.
Look where the window is.

108
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,900
Lili, don't upset me today.
I'm so sad. I failed my exam.

109
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,200
And on top of that my aunts
from Trás-os-Montes are arriving,

110
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,700
those to whom I've told
I'm already a doctor.

111
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,100
What a fine husband I'll have,
liar and flirtatious.

112
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,600
Me?! Watch your mouth.
You'd better not mention flirts.

113
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,500
- What do you mean by that?
- You flirt with every boy you meet.

114
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,200
- It's a lie! Not with them all!
- It's true.

115
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,800
I can even count them. Carlos is one.

116
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,600
Ernesto, the chemist's assistant,
that hunchbacked idiot makes it two.

117
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,000
The other one, Julião, makes it 3.

118
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,300
Ten cadets from the military Academy
makes it 13.

119
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,100
With Asdrubal, 14. Julio, 15.

120
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,400
Luís, 16.
Here comes the guillotine!

121
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,900
Mr. Caetano, don't get mad
at the girl.

122
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,000
Let her flirt with whom she pleases.
Let's try the coat, I'm in a hurry.

123
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,200
My apologies. But a father has to
watch over his daughter's happiness.

124
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,100
- But, Daddy...
- Shut up.

125
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,500
And don't cry
or you'll rust the pins.

126
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,000
You're embarrassing me
in front of a customer.

127
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,600
Gabriel isn't a customer,
he's a friend.

128
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,600
He's a father himself.
He also has a family ''on his back''.

129
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,200
Look how this fits you in the back.

130
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,600
- Yes, but I love him.
- ''I love him, I love him.''

131
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,900
A bohemian who will never settle down.
A cheater who is not fit for you.

132
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,000
- How's this for a fit?
- If you don't approve, I'll elope.

133
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,000
How dare you say that to my face?

134
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,800
If I catch that good-for-nothing,

135
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,600
I'll grab him by his collar
and finish him up.

136
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
Please be careful, Caetano!

137
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,100
You're right.
I'm sorry, Gabriel, I lost my temper.

138
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:07,800
That buccaneer is deceiving her.
And this buckram isn't good either.

139
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,400
- Students are all penniless riffraff.
- He's not penniless.

140
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,000
Vasco has aunts up North who will
leave him everything when they die.

141
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,200
What are you saying?
Is it anything worthwhile?

142
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,200
You can't imagine! One has 400,000,
another 100,000 and the other 300,000.

143
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,000
Hold on, hold on, girl!

144
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,600
400, 100 and 300.

145
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,200
- That's 800,000 escudos!
- What about checking this?

146
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,400
I'm checking it right here.

147
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,500
Dearest aunts! My dearest aunts!

148
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,300
Oh, my little boy!
My dearest boy!

149
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,500
So cute! Thank you.
Thank you so much.

150
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,800
- Dearest nephew. My dearest nephew.
- Leave it there.

151
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,300
- Give me a hand, do.
- Oh Lord, what an ordeal!

152
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,200
I'm going to fall.
I'm not used to this contraption.

153
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,300
- Here are some flowers.
- Thank you.

154
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,500
- What a joy! What a joy to see you.
- Let's go.

155
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,700
- Oh, my bag!
- And my money!

156
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,400
- Oh dear, I feel sick.
- I'm going to faint.

157
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,400
Hey, Vasco! What are you doing there
with those two old maids?

158
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,000
Leave me be. These are my aunts.
They just arrived from up north.

159
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,600
Their bags were stolen, they fainted,

160
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,900
I'm flat broke and I can't take them
to a hotel. I don't know what to do.

161
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,100
- We'll take them in the Bullfight Cab.
- Are you crazy?

162
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,900
We drop them at some hotel.
It's cheaper this way.

163
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,600
Are you crazy?
Take them in the Bullfight Cab?!

164
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,500
Don't do this to me, chaps!
This one is going to fall down.

165
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,500
This is outrageous. It's a shame.
Get your hands off the old girls.

166
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,400
Hands off the old girls.
This is outrageous. Why me?!

167
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,500
Hooray for Vasco's aunts!
Hooray!

168
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,000
Keep quiet, lads.
Come on, aunts.

169
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,000
- What is this? What's this?
- It's nothing, aunt.

170
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,700
It's a bullfight!
That's a bullfight poster I'm seeing.

171
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,800
It's not a bullfight.
It's something else.

172
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,400
Don't get upset, aunt.

173
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,500
This is all your fault.

174
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,900
Stop! Stop this!

175
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,500
Please, stop this!

176
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,600
It's going to stop.

177
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,400
I want to get out of here!

178
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,700
Lads, for goodness sake!
This is a family matter.

179
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,900
- Let me explain...
- What do you want to explain? This?

180
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,800
There. It's all explained.

181
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,400
- Vasco!
- Alice?

182
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,700
- Your father's out? I'm going in!
- What if he shows up?

183
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,600
- Let me make the most of this moment!
- Give me a kiss.

184
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,600
- People are looking.
- Who? A busybody?

185
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,000
Give me a kiss...

186
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,200
You're sad. Did your aunts arrive?

187
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,800
- Yes! But things aren't going well.
- Why?

188
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,500
I'll tell you later.
Now I want a kiss, but a real one.

189
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,200
Let me go. Go kiss your neighbour,
the singer, you rake.

190
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,100
Have you forgotten
what you did to me this morning?

191
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,700
Where can I hide, Alice? Oh, dear!

192
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,800
Watch it, I'll fall.
Where shall I go?

193
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
In here?
I might not fit in here.

194
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,600
- Quick, quick!
- Don't push me! Don't push me so!

195
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,000
Not under the table.
He'll see me here for sure.

196
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,400
- In here.
- Not in there either.

197
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,500
Why not? Where then?

198
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Let's go in, madam. I'm sure
I have something to your taste.

199
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,400
- Please go in.
- I want something very good.

200
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,800
But I will not spend more
than 100 escudos.

201
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,700
Alice, dear! How have you been?

202
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,900
- How are you, madam?
- Well, thank you.

203
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,700
Have a seat, madam.

204
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,000
I always buy winter clothes
in the summer. They're cheaper now.

205
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,500
Quite right. But here in my store,
we have everything:

206
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,400
raincoats, overcoats, cloaks.

207
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,500
Now, I even have
a second hand leather coat,

208
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,200
which is superb, a real bargain.

209
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,800
- Show me. Maybe I like it.
- You'll see it's an excellent buy.

210
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:39,400
- This is something special.
- Let me see the lining.

211
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,900
It's as good as new.

212
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,600
Granny, that dummy hit me.

213
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,600
Be quiet, boy, and behave yourself.

214
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,400
For you, madam, I'll make you
a special price of 250 escudos.

215
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:00,400
- I can't afford it, it's too much.
- What a pity. It would be a good buy.

216
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,200
- But it's too expensive.
- Let me see if I have something else.

217
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,500
Something cheaper, much cheaper.

218
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
What about this one?

219
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,900
- No, no. It's too long for my Jorge.
- Really?!

220
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,700
You will not leave my store
without a good buy.

221
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,800
I hope so, but bargains only.
I can't afford to spend too much.

222
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,000
Who knows if a shepherd's mantle
would please you?

223
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,000
A mouse!

224
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,200
A mouse!! Daddy, a mouse!!

225
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,500
No, a mouse, no!

226
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,000
Please, Daddy, kill the mouse!

227
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,700
Dad, kill it, please.

228
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,200
I'm so scared, so scared!

229
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,700
Such fuss over a mouse.
Lower your skirts. Get off there.

230
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
What the deuce!
I don't want any noise in here.

231
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:07,100
- Oh, you big rascal!
- Daddy, the 800 thousand!

232
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,200
Sorry, Mr. Caetano.
I'll tidy it all up and go right away.

233
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,800
Don't you dare!

234
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,300
Get inside. Inside!

235
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,200
How do you dare going right away?
It's a pleasure to have you in here!

236
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,200
My dear doctor, don't worry.
Come, please.

237
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,100
- But I'll tidy it all up.
- Don't worry.

238
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,100
Again?

239
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,900
Get inside.

240
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,900
Go, go.

241
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
- Thank you.
- Please, doctor.

242
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,000
Make yourself at home.

243
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,700
It's a pleasure to have you
in my house.

244
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,200
But what is this?

245
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,200
Vasco and the boss are bosom friends!

246
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,700
Come and have a look.

247
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:02,100
You see, my aunts got mad at me,
as soon as they arrived.

248
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,000
Since I have nowhere else
to go to for money,

249
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,500
I'm finished, disgraced, ruined.

250
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,200
I've even thought of telling them
the whole truth.

251
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,200
- That I'm not a doctor...
- Don't do that.

252
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,000
Nonsense!

253
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,000
Let me think.

254
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,900
- Sit down, please.
- You first, please. I insist.

255
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,600
- lf you say so. May I?
- After you, please.

256
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,800
I have an idea that might save you.
No ulterior motive!

257
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,600
I'll tell your aunts
that you're a distinguished doctor,

258
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,300
and that you've saved my life
four or five times,

259
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,700
I'll congratulate them
for such an educated scholar...

260
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,900
Which scholar?

261
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,500
You're the scholar.
I'm speaking in your favour.

262
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,000
That would be a big favour.
Could you do it?

263
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,600
They're from the country,
aren't they?

264
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,000
I've acted in the amateur theatre.

265
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,600
You're my second mother, sir.

266
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Of course,
I'm doing all this unselfishly.

267
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,500
Sure, sure!

268
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,500
Now, regarding your little one,
your daughter,

269
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,400
if you would give your permission...

270
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,600
My permission? Are you sure
you're the aunts' only heir?

271
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,300
- The only one.
- Let me give you a hug, my son.

272
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,100
Mother! I mean, father!

273
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,900
I've always liked you a lot.

274
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,300
And if I ever was rude to you,
it wasn't me, it was my temper, Vasco.

275
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,400
And if I ever was lax in paying
the bills, I apologise, Caetano.

276
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,500
- Where are the old ladies?
- At the Metrópole Hotel.

277
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,900
I'm going to speak to them now.

278
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,800
I shall even wear the colonel's
frock-coat and that's that.

279
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,000
- I'll help you put it on.
- Excuse me.

280
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,200
Yes, go right ahead.

281
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,100
They'll be happy to know
you saved me from three appendicitis,

282
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:29,900
four typhoid fevers
and a fishbone stuck in my throat...

283
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,600
Let's hope the words
don't give you a sore throat.

284
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
- My friend, the cobbler.
- My landlord.

285
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,400
I heard everything. Great plan
to steal money from the old ladies.

286
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,700
- Steal? You offend me.
- Don't worry, I'm not outraged.

287
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,400
I just want to split the money
between the three of us.

288
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:51,000
You owe me a pair of shoes
and three months rent.

289
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,700
Either we share
or we abide by ethics.

290
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,800
Girls,
don't miss the party later on.

291
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,800
In our street,
the gayest night is St. John's night.

292
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,900
And I'm going with my António,
my own António.

293
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,600
And I'll dance till I wear out
the soles of my shoes.

294
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,800
You want to exploit the boy
and take advantage of the situation.

295
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,500
- Take out the trousers!
- You're right. Take off the trousers!

296
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:21,300
- Take the trousers from that drawer.
- I thought you meant something else.

297
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,600
- No, I only want my money.
- Here.

298
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,800
You want your money, your money.

299
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,800
I won't have knives pointed
at anyone in my house.

300
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,200
- You're quite right!
- That won't do.

301
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,400
That won't do. I agree.
Those trousers won't do.

302
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,100
- The striped ones in the drawer.
- Who's stripped of drawers?

303
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,300
There. Here they are.

304
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,400
And I agreed to talk to his aunts
with no interest in mind.

305
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:55,400
He agreed to talk to my aunts
with no interest, profits, or gains.

306
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,800
Fine! If you don't want to come
to an agreement,

307
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,800
then you'll be hearing from me.

308
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,400
What are you going to do?
What a fool.

309
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,700
Look at the lieutenant's uniform.

310
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,200
- Don't worry. I'll pick it up.
- Thank you.

311
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,400
- Is it all right like this?
- Yes, thank you.

312
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,500
Well, my son,
I'm going to speak to the old ladies.

313
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,800
Bye-bye, my son.

314
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,700
Bye-bye, my father.

315
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,000
Bye-bye. Mind my hair.

316
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,800
Goodbye.

317
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,400
So sorry, madam.

318
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,000
- Bye-bye, my son.
- Bye-bye, my father.

319
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,200
- Father.
- Father!

320
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,900
Father in heaven, she's gorgeous.

321
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:47,500
- Carlos is a fortunate man.
- He's waiting for you. Come with me.

322
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,400
I would. But then I might end up
falling in love with you

323
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,600
and I would have to fight
my friend Carlos in a duel.

324
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,100
You're a daring one.
And your fiancée?

325
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,400
She's in there, she cant hear us.
And there's no harm in talking.

326
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Aren't you going to dance
this evening?

327
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,100
If you promise to dance with me
I'll stay there all night.

328
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,700
Maria da Graça,

329
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,400
when I'm near you,
my heart goes pit-a-pat.

330
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,700
It palpitates.

331
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:22,400
If it palpitates, it needs
a change of air, at once. Let's go.

332
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,900
Vasco!
Vasco, come here!

333
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,400
I want to talk to you. Come here!

334
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,600
Vasco!
Vasco, come here!

335
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,400
Vasco! Come here!
Wait. I want to talk to you.

336
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,800
Come here, Vasco.
Come here, you big rake!

337
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,900
Out you go. From now on,
don't bother to climb these stairs.

338
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,500
- Are we going to have a lift?
- No, we have to find another house.

339
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,500
You're going to leave us?
Are you going to move?

340
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,800
You don't want to get it.

341
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,700
Put this gentleman's furniture
out on the street.

342
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,600
Didn't I warn you, Dr. ''Phoney''?
Didn't I tell you?

343
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,600
I just hope it won't rain.

344
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,800
It would be a pity
to spoil such lovely furniture.

345
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:57,000
You stingy, you pig.
Littering the streets.

346
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,600
Snooty,
how much rent do you pay?

347
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,500
Look at his face.

348
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,700
Are you spending your summer there?

349
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,600
Half-wit. Beat it.

350
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,000
It's incredible!
Evicting your best tenant.

351
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,000
Your best customer! So stupid.

352
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,500
Jackass!

353
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,100
You're right, he's an ass.
And a strong headed bear.

354
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,300
You had it coming, my boy,
you had it coming.

355
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,900
Mr. Cobbler, my bed and a pair
of trousers are still up there.

356
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,400
This?

357
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,000
You can hang yourself with them,
you cheat.

358
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,400
Who is it?

359
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,800
The butcher.
How about a steak for lunch?

360
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I only receive my suppliers
at the service door.

361
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,200
Penniless-wit, go pay your rent
and take two witnesses along.

362
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,300
Mother, come here quickly.

363
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,200
Poor plant.

364
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,800
If I don't water it soon,
it will wilt.

365
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,900
Can't you see what you're doing?

366
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,300
Sorry, madam. I took you for a rose.

367
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,000
Who's going to pay
for my dress and laced skirt?

368
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,100
I've also skirted paying rent
to that monkey for 5 months now.

369
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,400
Rude creature, cheeky fellow.

370
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,100
Here we are, at my shop.

371
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,400
I'll be darned!

372
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,100
Vasco, what are you doing
in the middle of the square?

373
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,300
You see? No one messes with me.

374
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,800
And what now?

375
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,400
Now, either we share
the old ladies' money

376
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,800
or I'll tell them why the furniture
is in the middle of the street.

377
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
- So, this furniture is yours.
- And your furniture is this junk?

378
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,400
Where's the money we sent you
for your ''palace''?

379
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,200
- For your books?
- Your studies?

380
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,200
- Your carpets!
- Your curtains!

381
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,900
- For your comforts, yes.
- Yes, your comforts!

382
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,300
- Did you get it?
- It's a deal.

383
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,200
If we share the old girls' money,
I'll handle the situation right away.

384
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:28,000
I'm going to tell you the whole truth.
I'm not a doctor.

385
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,500
He's right.
He's not a doctor like others.

386
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,500
He's a true scientist,
a martyr of science.

387
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,500
That doesn't explain
why your furniture's out here.

388
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:43,700
This martyr of science who wrought
cures deemed astounding...

389
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,500
...sacrificed opulence for the sake
of his scientific findings.

390
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,900
He sacrificed opulence for the sake
of his scientific findings.

391
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,900
Even his fancy furniture
he sadly had to pawn.

392
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:00,900
His own clothes followed suit
'cause to mankind he was so drawn.

393
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:05,400
His own clothes followed suit
'cause to mankind he was so drawn.

394
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,900
He and Sousa Martins alike
have mastered all microbes

395
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:14,100
and, like Dr. Pestana,
his genius no one probes.

396
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:18,200
And, like Dr. Pestana,
his genius no one probes.

397
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,400
- Your knowledge has no price.
- On your aunts you can rely.

398
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,700
Science and myself will thank you,
if you finance your nephew

399
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Science and myself will thank you,
if you finance your nephew

400
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,100
- Gentlemen, where's your permit?
- What permit?

401
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,600
- Your permit for this masquerade.
- Masquerade?!

402
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,200
You're turning this into a carnival.

403
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,700
No permit, right?
You're all under arrest. Let's go.

404
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:43,100
Throughout life it would seem
we all have a dream,

405
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,300
a love dream.

406
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,600
It's a dream that hope excels,
in our hearts it dwells,

407
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,800
wondrously.

408
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:57,000
I too go on dreaming
and through a crowd I see me passing,

409
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,900
blissfully.

410
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:05,100
On the day I wed,
arm in arm with my love I'll thread,

411
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,300
lovingly.

412
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,600
Gentle doves by the hundred
I see flying by,

413
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,100
against the blue sky.

414
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:21,100
Their lily-white wings shining
like the lace of my veil.

415
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,900
I feel it's so true
that I've come to believe

416
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,400
that the good Lord wishes

417
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:36,000
my dream to fulfil

418
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,400
and that happiness
I will finally feel.

419
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,500
It is a pleasure so rare

420
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,600
to build castles in the air,

421
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,700
to sleep and not to wake,

422
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,800
I wish I'd dare!

423
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,700
To live the false ideal

424
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,900
of a chimera.

425
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,900
To dream...

426
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,600
...my life away!

427
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:18,700
After we are wedded then
I long for the moment when,

428
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,900
tenderly,

429
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,500
we wander hand in hand,
two gentle lovers,

430
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,300
alone together.

431
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:32,300
In a haze of happiness,
of peace and freshness,

432
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,600
just the two of us,

433
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,900
midst a tree-grove shade,
a trembling kiss we exchange,

434
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,900
just the two of us.

435
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:49,300
The heady perfume
of spring in bloom

436
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,000
embalms the air,

437
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,900
of this garden of love
that in dreams I see.

438
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,200
And my loved one
I picture there kneeling,

439
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,900
close beside me,

440
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,800
making a charming confession...

441
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:18,200
...of an eternal passion.

442
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,100
It is a pleasure so rare

443
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,400
to build castles in the air,

444
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,800
to sleep and not to wake,

445
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,600
I wish I'd dare!

446
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,600
To live the false ideal

447
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,700
of a chimera.

448
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,300
You're ruining Vasco's trousers, girl!

449
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,900
To dream...

450
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,600
...my life away!

451
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,500
- The wheel's going to turn!
- It's going to turn now!

452
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,700
I've only two tickets left.
Buy one, Mr.

453
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,200
Thank you, thank you.

454
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,100
Miss Alice,
do you still have the hippopotamus?

455
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:59,300
No, I got rid of it, thank Heaven.
But I've got a bear here.

456
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,900
Weedy, were you insinuating
that I'm an hippopotamus?

457
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:08,300
What if I was?
Would you slap me?

458
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,800
- Isn't he sweet?
- The wheel's going to turn now!

459
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,200
Twit!

460
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,800
- The donkey. The donkey.
- It's the donkey.

461
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,400
Congratulations!

462
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,800
Weedy, why don't you drink
mineral water instead?

463
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,400
Brandy's not for kids, lad.

464
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,300
Look at him.
He's got a mean look, hasn't he?

465
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,900
Are you feeling mean?
Oh, boy, just look at him.

466
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,800
Slap him, man!

467
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:04,500
Lads! Neighbours! Let's have peace
and harmony. You can't...

468
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,800
Lads, look!
The fireworks! The balloon!

469
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,800
The brass band
is playing merrily

470
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,700
and they all dance,
right around you and me.

471
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,500
Look at the balloon
on St. John's night.

472
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:45,500
To be able to dance at will
and with whom I please,

473
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:48,300
I took my daddy's leave

474
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:52,300
and kicked out my student
who got mad with it.

475
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,900
A basil bush I bought!

476
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,500
And off to the dance I go!

477
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,900
And dangling here I've got a dummy

478
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,800
looking just like the boy I fancy.

479
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,300
And dangling here I've got a dummy

480
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:14,000
looking just like the boy I fancy.

481
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,900
The brass band
is playing merrily

482
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,800
and they all dance,
right around you and me.

483
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,900
Look at the balloon
On St. John's night.

484
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:36,100
To be able to flirt a bit
I gave my girl the slip.

485
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:39,100
Let her go with whom she'll dare,

486
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:43,500
I know not who and I don't care,
I got a handful of a fairer lot.

487
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,700
A basil bush I bought!

488
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,200
And off to the dance I go!

489
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,900
And dangling here I've got a dummy

490
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:57,600
looking just like the girl I fancy.

491
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,900
And dangling here I've got a dummy

492
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,700
looking just like the girl I fancy.

493
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,600
The brass band
is playing merrily

494
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:12,500
and they all dance,
right around you and me.

495
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,700
The brass band
is playing merrily

496
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:19,700
and they all dance,
right around you and me.

497
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,900
Please, leave me alone.
I want nothing more to do with you.

498
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,700
You fool!

499
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,700
Sure!
You're crying because of me.

500
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:57,100
Idiot!
I'm crying because of the onion.

501
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:02,200
Let me say that your nephew Vasco
isn't really a bad lad.

502
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,500
He's not bad, no, but...

503
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,800
What do you mean by that?

504
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:11,000
Mrs. Perpétua, your nephew...
I'd better keep my mouth shut.

505
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:16,200
Your fondness of him may perhaps
be higher than he deserves.

506
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:21,700
It would be fairer
to think a bit less about him...

507
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,200
Caetano, are my trousers ready yet?

508
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:28,600
- I told you on Wednesday.
- That's today.

509
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,500
Up until midnight,
come back then.

510
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:35,000
- I don't care about your trousers.
- Rude creep!

511
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,300
But you were saying...

512
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:46,400
I was saying that it would be better
to think less about him

513
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,500
and a bit more about someone
who suffers because of you.

514
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:51,800
So?

515
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:56,600
Though I feel an almost maternal
affection for my nephew,

516
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:01,800
it doesn't mean that I may not come
to feel affection for others.

517
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:06,300
Vasco has given us many reasons
to rejoice about.

518
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,500
He's already a famous physician,
with a fine office.

519
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,500
We just haven't seen it yet.

520
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:16,300
And you probably never will.
I'd better keep my mouth shut.

521
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,100
After what happened last night,
don't bother to butter me up.

522
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,900
I came here
to clear things up with you.

523
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:28,500
At the dance you only had eyes
for that dimwit Weedy.

524
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:32,700
It doesn't matter, I got back at him.
I slapped him in the face.

525
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:35,300
That's what I should do to you!

526
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,300
A slap? You?! Slap me?
You rude hussy!

527
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,800
Daddy, Dad, come and see this!

528
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,400
If you shout for your father
I'll break everything here!

529
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,000
- And I'll throw this dough at you!
- Just try it!!

530
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,300
- You stupid! Pig!
- Jackass!

531
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:57,600
- Look what you've done to me.
- Idiot! Dimwit! Dumb-cluck!

532
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,300
- Dimwit yourself!
- It's over, go back to your singer.

533
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,300
I will, right now! I'll never set foot
in this house again!

534
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,400
Go back to your Weedy friend.
That skinny dimwit.

535
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,800
I'm all dirtied up.

536
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:20,500
I'm leaving this house for good
and I'll never come back.

537
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,700
I'll never come back.

538
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,600
Never again.

539
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:28,200
Goodbye forever, ungrateful woman.
Goodbye.

540
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,500
I'm leaving for good
and I'II... Curse this!

541
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,700
- And I'll never come back.
- Go.

542
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:38,300
- Goodbye. Farewell.
- You won't be missed. Brute!

543
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:42,300
Never again.
You'll never see me again.

544
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:47,400
Please girls, wash my face,
clean my jacket,

545
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:52,800
brush my soul, iron my heart out.

546
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,500
That ungrateful hussy!

547
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:02,700
How could he dare to deceive us?
When I get my hands on him...

548
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,800
Hello! Good morning.

549
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,600
Good morning.

550
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,100
- Hello, Aunt Efigénia.
- Hello.

551
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,800
- Greetings, Aunt Perpétua.
- Greetings.

552
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,100
Give us a kiss.

553
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,800
They're already suspicious of him.

554
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:28,000
We need to get Vasco out of the way.
This is a mine for us!

555
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:34,800
It's a fine day today, isn't it?

556
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:38,600
No, it even seems
to be a bit stormy in here.

557
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:42,400
Vasco, today we've decided
to give you the pleasure

558
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,400
of showing us
your physician's office.

559
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:50,100
- Your famous office.
- Yes, the physician's office.

560
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,800
There's no need to go there today.

561
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:56,200
Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow
or in a fortnight's time...

562
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,800
- No, we want to see it today.
- And right now!

563
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,100
Get me out of this mess.

564
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:21,800
- He's trying to gain time.
- He's wasting his time to no avail.

565
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,200
- So, where is your office?
- It's quite far away from here.

566
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,800
It's way out of town,
in a place called Sete Rios, Benfica.

567
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,800
How do we get there?
By coach, on horseback or...

568
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,600
It's quite far, you know?

569
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,800
Then take a taxi!
There's one right there. Are you free?

570
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,500
- Yes, I am, sir.
- Not you, the taxi.

571
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,900
- Well, aunts, maybe it's better...
- Don't say anymore.

572
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,100
...if we leave it for...
another time.

573
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Here it is. If you please, madam.

574
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,500
To Benfica. Got it, mister?
Benfica.

575
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:01,800
Have a nice trip, then.
I'm at your service.

576
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,900
Stop, stop, stop.

577
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,600
Please, come out.

578
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,900
We arrived at the famous office then?

579
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,900
- Not yet.
- Well then?

580
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,700
Three, please.

581
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,100
I have a surprise for you.

582
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,400
I don't have time
to see the camel today.

583
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:41,600
My mind is nearly made up. I want
to stop being the zoo veterinary.

584
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:42,900
It's too much work.

585
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:47,000
But at least have a look at those
Guinea fowls down with pip.

586
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:51,900
I can't. I have to go and see
D. José's horse. It's got bronchitis.

587
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,500
D. José's horse is sick?

588
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,000
Yes! D. José of Lencastre's horse,
the amateur bullfighter.

589
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:00,500
- Good afternoon then, doctor.
- Good afternoon.

590
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,300
I couldn't let you come to Lisbon
without admiring this park,

591
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,700
which is much nicer
than the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.

592
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:19,400
- Haven't you heard of them?
- No, but let's not stay long.

593
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:21,800
We won't. Let's go, come on.

594
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,900
Please.

595
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,600
Thank you.

596
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,300
This way, aunts, this way.

597
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:48,500
You couldn't have missed this.
The freaky trunks!

598
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:51,900
My straw hat!
Give it back to me, you brute!

599
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,800
Murderer! Thief! Stealing my hat!

600
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,900
- Do you find it funny?
- I do.

601
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,100
There! Do you find it funny now?

602
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,100
It's not fair!
You'll have to pay for it!

603
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:10,000
Fiddlesticks.
Hats are a dime a dozen. Let's go.

604
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,300
Hats are a dime a dozen.

605
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,500
- Tough luck.
- Dimwit! Hats are a dime a dozen.

606
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:22,500
I wouldn't want that rubbish.
Dimwit! Let's go and see the monkeys.

607
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:27,200
There are plenty.
Hats are a dime a dozen. Dimwit!

608
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:33,900
- What are you taking my hat for?
- Just kidding around, kiddie.

609
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,500
Hats are a dime a dozen.
Dimwit!

610
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,100
Look, Aunt,
there's a baby monkey here.

611
00:52:55,300 --> 00:53:00,100
Never mind, look at the monkey.
That's a wily one, right? Let's go.

612
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,500
Hats are a dime a dozen. Dimwit!

613
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,600
- Let's go see the otter.
- Yes, let's go.

614
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:20,200
Let's...
Hats are a dime a dozen. Dimwit!

615
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:25,300
Here's the otter, Aunts.
It's an amphibious animal.

616
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:29,300
Alive it's useless, but once dead,
women wear it around their necks.

617
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,500
The otter.
What a beautiful fur! Beautiful!

618
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:39,600
- Mister, who gave you that cap?
- The cap? Here. Don't mind me.

619
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:44,900
There were two otters in this cage.
And that's what you'd call...

620
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,700
''Bi-otters''!

621
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:51,100
He's right, ''bi-otters''.
That's a couple of otters.

622
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,300
You don't love me.

623
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,700
- You're the one who doesn't love me.
- Yes, I do. And you?

624
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,100
I do too, I love you very, very much.

625
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:12,400
Let's go and see the big crocodile
and I'll show you the wildebeest.

626
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,500
No, no more horseplay.

627
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:18,900
- We want is to see your office.
- That's what's important.

628
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:22,800
If we don't go there today,
we'll go some other day.

629
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,500
You're not too eager to take us there.
Do you have an office at all?

630
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:30,100
Don't you believe me, Aunts?
Don't you?

631
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,300
Sometimes I even wonder
if you're actually a doctor.

632
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:38,100
Who put such silly notions
in your heads? I'm not a doctor?

633
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:43,100
The remarks you make
offend and hurt me, Aunts.

634
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:47,900
- So, I'm not a doctor?
- Thank God you're still here, doctor.

635
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:51,100
See? I really am a doctor!

636
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:55,700
Doctor,
one of your patients is very sick.

637
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,900
I need you to come with me
right away,

638
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:03,100
otherwise, he may pass away.

639
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,100
Let's see him then.
Come on.

640
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:09,000
Stay here and play with the lions.
They're harmless pets.

641
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,400
You know, duty calls.

642
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,900
So, am I a doctor or not?
Let's go.

643
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,800
- Call me doctor.
- Yes, doctor.

644
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,600
- Louder.
- Yes, doctor!

645
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,500
So, am I a doctor or not?

646
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,400
- Here's your patient.
- My patient?

647
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,400
There's some
misunderstanding here.

648
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:32,500
I'm a real good friend,
I helped you earn another 20 escudos.

649
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:36,500
- 20 escudos? I don't get it.
- Come, come, now.

650
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:41,600
As a veterinarian you get 20 escudos
for each animal you see.

651
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:45,800
I get 20...? Yes, you're right.
My mind was on something else.

652
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,900
We can't waste 20 escudos.
Let's kill the beast. Come on.

653
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:54,800
This giraffe is very sick.
Very sick.

654
00:55:55,700 --> 00:56:00,600
See all those spots there?
It's a liver problem. Yes, liver.

655
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:04,900
I need to see its tongue.
It's dirty all right.

656
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:08,500
- Has it been eating well?
- No.

657
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,900
From now on, only boiled water.
Nothing else.

658
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:16,100
Let's put her on a strict diet.
Strict!

659
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:20,700
- When do I get my 20 escudos?
- You can get them at the office now.

660
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,500
No, not now.
First, we'll go check the seal.

661
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:26,800
- But the seal is in great shape.
- No, it's not, I'm the expert here.

662
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,100
The seal is very sick.

663
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:33,500
Unless they pay less for it
because it's a seal.

664
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,800
No, doctor, it's the same for all.

665
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,800
20 escudos
for each little beast we see?

666
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,700
Let's go see the seal.
And we'll go and see all the animals.

667
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,800
This pigeon is neurasthenic.

668
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,500
He's like this since his female
flew the coop and took two chicks.

669
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:02,600
- Two chicks?
- She took two baby pigeons.

670
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:06,700
What he needs is entertainment.
You should take him to the zoo.

671
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:10,800
And now let's go see the next one.
You're a good fellow.

672
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,800
Say 33.

673
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:21,900
33 is not enough, he's too big.

674
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,500
Say 33,333.

675
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:27,700
Again.

676
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:35,900
- But where is Vasco?
- Where did he go? We can't find him.

677
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:51,300
The management
owes me a lot of money.

678
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:56,500
20 monkeys at 20 monkeys each,
makes 400 monkeys, plus 180 monkeys.

679
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:00,300
You're quite a monkey, doctor.

680
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,900
My dear friend,
we're all after the same thing.

681
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:09,300
Look, it's Vasco.
And the Aunts are over there.

682
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:14,200
I'll make him pay for slapping me
on St. John's night.

683
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,400
Vasco,
what's the meaning of all this?

684
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,300
Are you a physician or veterinary?
What are you doing down there?

685
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,700
Dear Aunts, you know, I...

686
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,900
Your Aunts threw you to the apes when
they found out you failed your exam?

687
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,500
Failed!

688
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,700
Do they know you'll never be a doctor
because you're lazy and a big liar?

689
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,000
This is unbelievable.

690
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,500
It's a lie! Let me explain everything.
I'm going up there.

691
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:46,100
If I wasn't in here,
I would break you in half.

692
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:51,100
You don't know who you're
dealing with. He's a cunning devil.

693
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,900
Bye-bye, Vasco, my lad.

694
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:29,300
Hey, man, you there!

695
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,900
It's forbidden to sleep
on garden benches.

696
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,200
Get a move, go.

697
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:16,300
- What's the matter with you, girl?
- You're still thinking of Vasco, no?

698
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:22,100
Silly! If you mention him,
she starts crying her eyes out.

699
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:26,900
- There's no joy since they broke up.
- I liked this much better before.

700
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:30,300
Don't say that
because it reminds me of him.

701
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,500
Shut up, you plump face.

702
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:37,900
Don't mention plump faces
because it also reminds me of him.

703
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,900
What going on here? Merry-making?
Get to work.

704
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,500
- Alice, please.
- Yes, Daddy?

705
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:51,300
Undo the hem of these trousers.
The customer must have grown taller.

706
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:55,000
- We must add some 8 inches.
- Yes, Daddy.

707
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,100
Now, girls, don't forget.

708
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:02,900
Sunday we'll crown Miss Seamstress
of our neighbourhood.

709
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:08,500
Besides, as president of the jury
and stage director of our Academy,

710
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:14,000
I rather think that the queen
will be someone from this workshop.

711
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:17,400
Mr. Caetano,
is Alice also a candidate?

712
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,800
Why shouldn't she be?
Of course she is.

713
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:26,100
- I've been teaching her some verses.
- I'm terrible at reciting.

714
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,800
Be quiet.
I'm the academy stage director.

715
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I've taught others dumber than you
and they all did well so far!

716
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,800
- I'll make a fool of myself.
- Work and shut up!

717
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:40,100
Set an example for the others.

718
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:45,600
- I can't recite.
- You're all puffed up, aren't you?

719
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:49,400
Don't mention puffed up
because it reminds me of him.

720
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:56,800
Carlos...

721
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,300
- You, Vasco?
- Carlos!

722
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,600
Let me greet you, Carlos.

723
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,600
What's happened?
Have you forgotten your friend?

724
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:06,600
I was ashamed of being seen
in this terrible state.

725
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:11,000
Can you believe it?
My aunts have abandoned me,

726
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:16,000
influenced by the deceitful tailor
and the cynical cobbler.

727
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:20,000
Worst of all, even Alice has chosen
that idiot Weedy over me.

728
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:24,600
You just need to look after yourself
and earn a living.

729
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:27,800
- You can't go on living like that.
- No, I can't, I know.

730
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,600
Listen, do still have your guitar?

731
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:36,000
Yes, I do.
I mean, it's pawned. Why?

732
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:40,600
I've got an idea. Come with me.
You have to shave and put on a tie.

733
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,900
- Have you got something for me?
- You'll see.

734
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:45,400
You're an angel
that was sent to help me.

735
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,200
I look awful indeed.
Excuse me.

736
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:54,800
Where are we going?

737
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,600
Hooray for Dr. Barbosa Girão
Recreation Academy.

738
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,000
Hooray!

739
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,600
Tell me. Who do you vote for?
Gentleman?

740
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,100
For the one in black.

741
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:12,500
For the one in green.

742
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:16,100
- And you, sir?
- My vote is for the one in blue.

743
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:19,500
- And you?
- Without any doubt, the one in red.

744
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:22,300
I'm fully informed.

745
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:25,600
First, here there's no consensus.

746
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:30,200
Second, you understand nothing
of female beauty.

747
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,100
Old man, is there no end to this?

748
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:37,000
Show some respect for the jury, man.
Damn it!

749
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:42,200
In view of the audience's impatience,
I'll decide the matter myself.

750
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,900
Ladies and gentlemen,

751
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:50,900
on this solemn occasion,
where I see, side by side,

752
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:56,000
the top trade representatives
of our neighbourhood... Thank you.

753
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:59,700
The gentlemen of our industry

754
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,300
and the lovely faces of...

755
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:08,400
and the lovely faces
of the lady members

756
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:11,900
of this recreational society,

757
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,100
I raise may cup...

758
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,400
I won't raise my cup for now,

759
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:20,500
I'll do it later on,

760
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:25,600
because we are going to begin
the election for Miss Seamstress,

761
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:30,700
a humble, but honest working class...
Thank you.

762
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,200
We shall do it with that impartiality

763
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:37,400
for which we are well known.

764
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:41,300
- The jury has decided...
- The jury has decided?

765
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:44,000
The jury has decided...

766
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:47,900
...after a detailed

767
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
and most impartial analysis,

768
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:56,600
of all candidates
to our Contest for Miss Seamstress...

769
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:00,100
- What a big cheat he is!
- Show some respect for the Chair!

770
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:02,200
And for the table as well.

771
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:07,500
Though against my will

772
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:12,300
and thereby
offending my modesty,

773
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:19,000
the jury has decided to crown
Miss Seamstress of the neighbourhood,

774
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:23,000
Miss Alice Costa,

775
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:25,800
my daughter.

776
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:41,500
Play the anthem!

777
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,900
We shall proceed
with the crowning ceremony.

778
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,900
- What?
- The crowning ceremony.

779
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:09,300
You'll perform your job as the
official photographer of our Academy.

780
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:12,200
Excuse me. My daughter...

781
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,200
My lad...

782
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:25,000
My daughter...
Hand me the sash.

783
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:27,600
On behalf of the board...

784
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,900
It's inside the drawer, man!

785
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:34,600
...and in general,
on behalf of the Portuguese youth,

786
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,000
I salute you.

787
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:44,200
A little bit of anthem, please.

788
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:33,900
Ernestina, let's go.
This was all a big sham.

789
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,900
ALEXANDRINO'S RETREAT

790
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:15,200
Let's sit over here.
This will do nicely.

791
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:19,100
Give me a cigarette.

792
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:21,900
Light, too.

793
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:28,000
I've got nothing, not even matches.
May I have something to drink?

794
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,100
- Order whatever you want.
- May I?

795
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:34,100
What about the match box?

796
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:36,400
- Didn't you light it?
- No.

797
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:39,600
- Wait here, I'll be right back.
- Yes, you can go.

798
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:47,400
Listen, bring me some cold drink,

799
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,500
because I'm thirsty.

800
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:51,400
Brandy, for instance.

801
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:54,200
Please, speak up. I'm deaf.

802
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:58,600
That's all I needed. He's deaf.

803
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:00,600
Brandy!!

804
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,500
Silence!

805
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:07,800
The renowned Maria Albertina
will sing the Fado ''Warm Kisses''.

806
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,600
You kissed me upon awaking,

807
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:31,600
Oh, my love and my life,

808
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:35,700
You kissed me upon awaking,

809
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,700
Oh, my love and my life.

810
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,400
But mind, don't you go forgetting

811
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:46,200
to kiss me upon leaving.

812
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:50,600
But mind, don't you go forgetting

813
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,100
to kiss me upon leaving.

814
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:58,100
From my window, I can still see you

815
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,800
until you turn the corner.

816
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:05,600
From my window, I can still see you,

817
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,800
until you turn the corner.

818
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:12,600
How I yearn for that kiss

819
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:16,700
that you throw me from yonder.

820
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:20,200
How I yearn for that kiss

821
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,700
that you throw me from yonder.

822
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:28,100
All day long while we're apart,

823
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:31,700
I long, my beloved sweetheart,

824
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,600
all day long while we're apart,

825
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,900
I long, my beloved sweetheart,

826
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,600
for that warm kiss you'll give me,

827
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:46,300
when you come home to me.

828
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,900
For that warm kiss you'll give me,

829
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:53,100
when you come home to me.

830
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,600
Where's my small funnel?

831
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:06,500
Bring me another brandy.

832
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:09,400
Brandy! I heard perfectly.

833
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,500
Marvel of marvels!

834
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:17,900
You're my saviour, sir.
You magic funnel!

835
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:23,300
Dear audience, let's begin
our musical and singing evening.

836
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:27,000
My daughter,
who never dreamed of being crowned,

837
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:31,100
has, for the past 2 weeks, been
learning a duet to entertain you

838
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:33,400
on this memorable occasion.

839
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:36,500
The ditty's called
''The Thimble and the Needle''.

840
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:39,800
It's a song from the famous
musical comedy ''The Codfish Patty''.

841
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,400
Here you go.
''The Thimble and the Needle''.

842
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,900
- Daddy, I'm shy.
- Don't argue.

843
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:48,600
- Daddy, I don't want to do it.
- Do you want a slap in the face?

844
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,900
You want a pat in the face.
Please,''The Thimble and the Needle''.

845
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:54,200
Thank you.

846
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,800
Come here, fair needle,
so diligent and so fine.

847
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:09,600
Come, give me your lips,
sweet like sugar candy.

848
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:13,400
Thimble, you shan't have me,
I'm crafty and cunning,

849
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:17,600
and even more looped
than a crochet needle.

850
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:21,800
Come, come, come,
come, my fair needle.

851
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:25,600
Go, go, go,
go, my handsome thimble.

852
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:30,100
Naughty little dove,
no double dealings.

853
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:33,300
Come and sew the apron trimmings...

854
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:37,700
Daddy, I warned you
I couldn't sing this high pitch.

855
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:40,800
You can because your voice is strong.

856
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,800
...with love.

857
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:46,600
Come, come, come,
come, my fair needle.

858
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,100
Go, go, go,
go, my handsome thimble.

859
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:55,200
Naughty little sweetheart,
no more wiles.

860
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,800
You're the loveliest,
most virginal needle of Portugal!

861
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:03,100
- Cheese grater!
- See, Daddy, what I have to endure?

862
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:05,500
I see the chap, and he'll regret it.

863
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:10,700
I know you don't love me,
for I am not of silver made,

864
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:14,400
and that you despise me,
for I am only of tin plate.

865
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:18,900
Dear thimble, don't you cry,
I know you are of tin ply.

866
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:21,600
I too do my sewing

867
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:25,200
on a beggar's clothing.

868
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:30,500
Come, come, come,
come, my fair needle.

869
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,300
Go, go, go,
go, my handsome thimble.

870
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:39,000
Naughty little dove,
no double dealings.

871
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:41,900
Come and sew the apron trimmings...

872
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:46,400
- This one was even worse, Daddy.
- Skip the apron part and carry on.

873
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:49,000
...with love.

874
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:52,600
Come, come, come,
come, my fair needle.

875
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Go, go, go,
go, my handsome thimble.

876
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:01,000
Naughty little sweetheart,
no more wiles.

877
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:06,200
You're the loveliest,
most virginal needle of Portugal!

878
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:16,500
Drink up. Drink, my saviour,
it's good for your health.

879
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:18,800
- One more sip.
- Three beers!

880
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:22,800
Three beers? I heard perfectly.
Excuse me.

881
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:29,800
My friend there is a doctor
and a very famous one in Lisbon.

882
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,500
He's a first class singer.

883
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:34,000
When we went to Brazil
with the University Choir

884
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:36,300
his Fado singing was a smashing hit.

885
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,700
- Was he really?
- He was, believe me.

886
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,400
He'd be the right attraction for this.
You'd get a full house here.

887
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,200
You may be right.

888
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,200
Gone are the days

889
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:51,000
when carpenters,
joiners and carvers sang Fado.

890
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:55,100
I'll introduce him to you.
Vasco! Vasco, come here.

891
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:57,200
Who's calling me?

892
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:02,600
Carlos, how are you?
Good afternoon.

893
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,300
Good afternoon.

894
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:09,700
Are there two of you?
Well, that's true.

895
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Carlos.
Carlos is plural, so there are two.

896
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,600
- I've found you a job.
- Doing what?

897
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:22,600
- You're on the brink of knowing.
- I'm on for a drink? Fantastic!

898
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:26,000
- This is Mr. Alexandrino.
- Pleased to meet you.

899
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,600
- How are you?
- How do you do?

900
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:32,000
What a cute moustache
to hang balloons from. A joke, sorry.

901
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:36,300
- He'll hire you to sing Fado.
- To sing Fado? Me? Never!

902
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:40,000
Fado is the poison of our race!
I'm against Fado!

903
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,400
Death to Fado singers!

904
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:45,500
Shut up, for goodness sake!
I have customers here.

905
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:48,500
I don't care about them!
I'm against Fado!

906
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:53,400
Kill the customers and the guitar
players! Smash the guitars!

907
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:58,000
- This is outrageous, man!
- We want our ''Fado'', you lunatic.

908
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:03,000
I'm a doctor. It's my duty to cure
all social ailments.

909
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:09,900
There are weeks dedicated to so many
things. Why not against Fado?

910
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:15,800
One for all and all against Fado!
All against Fado!

911
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:30,100
Let's finish this.
How many are you? How many?

912
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:35,300
Down with the Portuguese guitars!
Down with the Spanish guitars!

913
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:46,500
Van in.

914
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:50,300
Van out.

915
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:55,300
My saviour, what's going on?

916
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:02,200
Are you trying to ruin me?
Get out of here.

917
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:05,200
I'm against Fado!

918
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,800
You're throwing me out,
only because I want you to.

919
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:11,300
Carlos, give me a kiss!

920
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:16,400
- I'm leaving because I want to.
- Calm down, friends, calm down.

921
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:24,600
You'll pay for this.

922
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:31,100
You're doing this to me
because I'm a child.

923
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:36,000
Orphaned, abandoned...

924
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:45,400
...kicked out...

925
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:50,100
...sad and alone.

926
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:55,200
We're now going to listen
to some variations of Fado,

927
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:56,800
in D minor,

928
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:01,600
by the famous guitarist,
our friend, the cabinet-maker.

929
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,800
And I'm sorry for all that.

930
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,800
What a dark destiny is mine,

931
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:19,900
what a vile and degrading destiny.

932
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,200
How I miss deep inside

933
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,800
my old student life.

934
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,900
In that brief time of love and joy,
the best one for any boy,

935
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:35,900
I was a bold seducer of girls.

936
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,900
Cape in the air,
bare-headed and debonair,

937
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:44,000
I lived carefree...
And careless went on living.

938
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:48,200
I left them without much ado

939
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:52,100
and that was a piece of cake.

940
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:55,400
Until the one with the bangs

941
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:59,300
decided to take my poor heart.

942
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:04,900
Always flat broke,
in tatters my robe,

943
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:08,800
shoes and socks I tore,
a cane in hand roguishly I wore.

944
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Wandering around like a playboy,
at balls and dances I would enjoy,

945
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:16,600
flirting, drinking
and Fado singing.

946
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,800
Now I look back
and I recall

947
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:25,600
Those huge books
I used to read

948
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:29,000
the lecturers, the university,

949
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,700
the table of anatomy.

950
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:35,600
GREAT ATTRACTION
THE FADO SINGING DOCTOR

951
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:40,300
GREAT FADO SESSION
WITH THE FAMOUS VASCO LEITÃO

952
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:48,300
AN ELEGANT EVENING
THE KING OF FADO SINGERS

953
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:55,400
In Fado my faith is endless,

954
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:59,600
it bewitches, fascinates
and captivates.

955
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:03,200
You'll find it's even great

956
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:06,200
to hear it on the wireless.

957
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:09,400
When it is sung with passion,

958
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:12,400
with tradition and devotion,

959
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:16,000
our Fado is wonderful
and enthrals us all.

960
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:20,400
It's our most popular song,
it makes us vibrate with emotion

961
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:24,300
and that's why
I m a doctor and a Fado singer.

962
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,100
Thank you.

963
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:29,400
- Very well, doctor!
- Thanks.

964
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,600
So, my friend?!
Here we are!

965
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:49,000
You see, I was right
in wanting to bring you here.

966
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:50,900
I'm so touched.

967
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:54,200
My friend Asdrubal.
You're always so kind, my friend.

968
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:57,800
I sang as I always do.
Araújo, always here so devotedly.

969
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,600
Dr. Vasco, please accept this token
from a great admirer of yours.

970
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:06,800
Thank you, miss.
Give me a kiss, you little minx.

971
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:10,300
Vasco, please, they want more Fado.

972
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:14,500
- Sing the ''double-pneumonia'' Fado.
- Vasco, dear...

973
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:20,000
Go away, you cruel Aunts, away!

974
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:24,000
Now you acknowledge me because
you know I do not need your money.

975
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:28,800
Thank you. Now, thank God,
I can earn a living.

976
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:32,400
- I'm no heavy load on anyone.
- Damnation! You're heavy!

977
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:36,700
I'm sorry, Alexandrino.
Excuse me. Away!

978
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:47,100
Lads, no more Fado songs.
I sang here today for the last time.

979
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:52,000
- No more ''Little Anatomy Vasco''.
- No, Vasco, don't do that.

980
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,400
Tomorrow I'll take my exam again,

981
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:58,500
and I shall be once and for all
Dr. Vasco Leitão.

982
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:02,400
Farewell,
Fado lovers of my country.

983
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:21,400
Thank you!

984
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,600
Thank you, my friend.

985
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:31,100
We shall miss you, man.

986
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:35,700
Let me through.
You can't stop me, let me through.

987
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:43,600
Goodbye, Vasco.

988
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,500
Excuse me.

989
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:49,200
- Goodbye, Vasco.
- It's a real pity.

990
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:52,400
Let me through, gentleman.
Vasco!

991
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:54,000
My little Vasco!

992
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:31,200
What do you know
about parasiticide action?

993
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:34,000
- And anti-dotal?
- And anti-toxic?

994
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:37,800
It's a process through which
medications do their healing process.

995
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,500
According to Dr. Mata, pages 129 and
following, in his ''Pharmacology'' book,

996
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:44,600
third edition, 1921,

997
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:48,900
printed by the National Press
at Rua Escola Politécnica, 111 to 119,

998
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:50,900
in Lisbon,

999
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:53,900
the plastering masses
of vesicant action,

1000
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:56,200
are nowadays often replaced

1001
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:59,600
by the tainting-vesicant liquor
of Squyal,

1002
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:01,900
an ether-aseptic
tincture of Brechten,

1003
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:05,000
the formula for which can be found
in the British Pharmacopoeia,

1004
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:08,500
the 1885 edition,
on pages 239 and following.

1005
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:13,000
In the same case is the vesicatory
liquid of Bidet, F. de Bouchardat,

1006
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:18,100
1894, on page 435. But it is less
applied than the former one.

1007
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:21,800
The ordinary extracts are medications
that result from evaporation...

1008
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,400
That's enough. Enough.
I can see that you know.

1009
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,000
What is...?

1010
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:30,600
- You first, esteemed colleague.
- Please, go ahead.

1011
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:33,600
One further question.

1012
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,600
Which is the main
lateral-flexor muscle

1013
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:39,800
of the neck?

1014
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,200
It's the sternocleidomastoid.

1015
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:49,300
Oh, my dear boy!
He even knows what the mastoid is.

1016
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:51,000
The mastoid!

1017
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:54,900
- Madam, what did he say?
- What he said pleased me a lot.

1018
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:58,400
Listen, João,
what's this mastoid thing?

1019
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:01,100
You're a Fado singer
and you don't know?

1020
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:03,200
- No, I don't.
- Neither do I.

1021
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:07,100
He even knows what the mastoid is!
Imagine that!

1022
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,400
What else can we ask him?

1023
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:17,400
Is that you, Alice?

1024
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:21,600
Everything is fine. Imagine!
He even knows what the mastoid is.

1025
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:25,200
Oh, bliss!
Thank you, Daddy, see you later.

1026
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:28,600
The mastoid! My darling Vasco!

1027
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:31,900
But what is this mastoid thing?

1028
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:34,400
We are satisfied.

1029
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:38,700
- Very good, Vasco.
- Very good.

1030
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:57,100
I've been deaf for 20 years
and I never heard an exam like this.

1031
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,600
Doctor, if you want,
I'll give you 300 escudos

1032
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:05,200
if you sing the ''mastoid'' Fado
at my place this Sunday.

1033
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:08,600
- I can't, my friend.
- Accept it, Doc.

1034
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:13,400
You left the professors speechless.

1035
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,800
Give him a hug.

1036
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,400
What a touching scene.

1037
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,800
- The aunts.
- The aunts. Let them come hither.

1038
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,900
Let the family through.

1039
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:38,500
I can't forget the mastoid!

1040
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,900
- Don't cry, ladies, don't.
- I can't help it.

1041
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:44,900
- It was a fine exam!
- As fine as his heart.

1042
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:47,600
- Thank you.
- Hooray for Vasco!

1043
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,100
I request the floor!

1044
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,800
- Do you like to feel my hand?
- I do!

1045
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,700
- Why?
- I don't know.

1046
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:25,400
I request the floor!

1047
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,200
Dammit! I request the floor!

1048
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:37,200
- I'm no speaker.
- Hear, hear.

1049
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:40,800
The only speech I've ever made

1050
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:44,200
was by the cold tomb
of my friend Ernesto,

1051
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,700
who died in his prime.

1052
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:49,800
And it was made...

1053
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,900
...between hiccups...

1054
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:55,600
...that I said goodbye
to a great friend,

1055
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:59,400
with no disregard for Vasco there,
who is also a great friend.

1056
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:00,900
Hear, hear.

1057
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:04,100
- I have no oratory gifts.
- Hear, hear.

1058
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:07,800
I have no words,
I have no wine either.

1059
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:13,800
- But I have something inside...
- Couldn't that be air in your pipes?

1060
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:19,800
What I feel inside me
can only be ''sastifaction''

1061
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,100
for this auspicious marriage
celebrated today,

1062
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:26,700
and that I wish
there will be many more to come.

1063
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:36,100
Vasco, Vasco, Vasco!

1064
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:40,800
Speech, Vasco!

1065
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:45,200
I request the floor.

1066
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:52,000
Ladies,
so lovely and charming,

1067
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:55,800
for your grace and charm
I thank you kindly.

1068
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:59,300
Gentlemen,
if you're ailing and ill

1069
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:03,200
or with pneumonia afflicted
treat you I sure will.

1070
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:06,600
Lisbon now has in me a doctor,

1071
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:10,400
besides physician,
you see, I'm an inventor.

1072
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:14,300
I'll be there ready to see you,
to vaccinate and cure you,

1073
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:18,600
to cut you and sew you up again
and smilingly mitigate your pain.

1074
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:22,100
My satisfaction,
worth and dedication

1075
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:26,100
are in this invention:
the Happy Therapy medication.

1076
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:29,400
To handle an emergency,
I can now guarantee,

1077
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:33,400
but from a contingency
should you die, die laughingly.

1078
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,600
The End

1079
