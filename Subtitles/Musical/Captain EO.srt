1
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,000
The Cosmos:

2
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,750
a universe of good and evil
where a small group struggles ...

3
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,000
... to bring freedom to the
countless worlds of despair.

4
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,500
A rag-tag band led by
the infamous Captain EO.

5
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,300
This planet doesn't look
so dangerous, Idy.

6
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,600
Is this it, Ody?

7
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,500
- We'll see.
- Ohh.

8
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,220
We better find that landing beacon.

9
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,300
Hey, Hooter, we're almost there!

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh, boy!

11
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,500
Don't get too close or you'll
trip their intrusion alarm.

12
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,500
Yeah, don't blow it you guys.

13
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,700
- Relax, there's no problem.
- No problem.

14
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,980
INTRUSION ALERT!!!

15
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,580
- Battle alert!
- Battle alert!!

16
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,800
Don't panic! That's what got us
into trouble the last time.

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,600
- It wasn't our fault. It was Hooter's fault.
- Right, Hooter's fault.

18
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,400
Oh, Hooter!

19
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,100
Straighten up men. It's the Captain.

20
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,000
Good morning, Captain.

21
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,200
It looks like we tripped
their intrusion alarm, sir.

22
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,000
Idy and Ody blew it.
They got too close.

23
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,300
We're goin' in.

24
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,100
Sir, the ship is in absolutely
no condition to go into battle. 

25
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,700
I thought we'd begin by
cleaning up Hooter's bunk.

26
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,300
Hooter!

27
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,660
Listen! The Command considers
us a bunch of losers.

28
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,140
But we're gonna do it right this time,
'cause we're the best.

29
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,800
We don't we'll be drummed
out of the corps.

30
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,700
We won't let you down this time, sir.

31
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,700
- We're going to do it right.
- That's right, we'll be perfect, sir.

32
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,100
OK.

33
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,420
- Captain, there's something weird out there.
- A patrol ship.

34
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,980
I thought so. Maybe we can outrun him.

35
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,100
- It's going to ram us!
- Duck!

36
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,580
Get to your stations!

37
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,380
- Hold on, everybody, hold on!!!
- We haven't found the landing beacon yet.

38
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,580
Somebody get the map.
Where's the map?!

39
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,980
- Who's got the map?
- Fuzzball.

40
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,180
Hooter has it.

41
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,260
- Hooter has it!
- Hooter!!

42
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,980
- I think I ate it!
- You ate it?!

43
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,740
Captain EO! Captain EO!

44
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,180
Commander Bog.

45
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,300
Captain EO, you are late reporting in.

46
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,420
Are you having a problem
finding our landing beacon? 

47
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,420
No, sir. Everything's under control, sir! 

48
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,180
What's going on?

49
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,140
We're having a slight
thruster malfunction, sir.

50
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:06,180
Captain EO, have you engaged
in combat against orders?!

51
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,700
I can't see!
Captain EO, what's going on?

52
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,900
- Going through.
- No! Idy, the sail's not in.

53
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,020
- Hooter, bring in the sail!
- OK.

54
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,300
- It's right behind you, Hooter.
- I can't reach it.

55
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,800
What's going on?

56
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,220
Somebody push the red button.

57
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,800
Use your trunk, Hooter.

58
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,600
Come on, Hooter. Stretch!

59
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,060
Woo!!!

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,300
We're losing power.

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,800
Everybody hold on!!!

62
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,580
Captain EO? Captain EO?!

63
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:38,460
I think we found the beacon.
Captain EO, take a look at this.

64
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,180
The homing beacon. We ran right into it!!

65
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,180
- Commander Bog!
- Captain EO?

66
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,900
Everything's OK, sir.

67
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,100
- Right on time.
- And we've reached the homing beacon, sir.

68
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,900
Well, so far, so good, Captain EO.
But, I must admit that I am a bit surprised ...

69
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,100
... after the mess you made of your last mission.
But now that you've found the beacon, ...

70
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:08,900
... take the map, find the Supreme Leader and give
her the gift. You do have the map, don't you? 

71
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,000
- No problem.
- No problem, sir.
- Right here.

72
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,900
Then get going!

73
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:21,340
- Boy, do we have a problem.
- We'll never find the Supreme
leader without a map.

74
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,020
Come on.

75
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,940
- I couldn't help it.
- Quiet.

76
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,980
- Hooter.
- I'm disguising myself.

77
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,180
Hooter, listen. Put it back and let's go.

78
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,420
- Don't be silly.
- Gotta have a disguise.

79
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,700
- Shh!
- Sorry.

80
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,600
Get them!

81
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,100
Who is it?

82
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,200
The Supreme Leader.

83
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,940
Hey, I told you I'd find her.

84
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,660
Silence!

85
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,100
Infidel!

86
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,600
Infidel?

87
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:52,200
You infect my world with your presence.
Turn the others into ... 

88
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,200
... trash cans!

89
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,600
- See you later trash can!
- And for him ...

90
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:07,600
... 100 years of torture
in my deepest dungeon.

91
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,420
Your highness, my loyal companions
and I accept these punishments. 

92
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,660
- We do?
- Of course we do, he's our captain.

93
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,060
I speak for myself.

94
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,060
We have come here uninvited and unannounced.

95
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:29,220
So, then we both admit to your stupidity!

96
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,740
Why have you come?

97
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:37,400
To bring a gift, your highness.
To someone as beautiful as you. 

98
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:43,020
You think me beautiful?

99
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,940
Very beautiful within, your highness,
but without a key to unlock it.

100
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,600
And that is my gift to you.

101
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,200
So, let me see this gift.

102
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,200
Not only see, your highness, but hear.

103
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,260
- Hooter, hurry up!
- Come on, Hooter.

104
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,300
- Over here.
- No.

105
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,300
Send in my troops!

106
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,000
I got it, I got it!

107
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,980
Hooter!! Hurry up and fix it, Hooter!

108
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,860
Send him to my dungeon!

109
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Hooter!

110
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,000
I got it!

111
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,000
Get him!

112
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,500
<i>Woo!

113
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,060
<i>We're on a mission in the
everlasting light that shines.

114
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:07,200
<i>A revelation of the truth
and chapters of our minds.

115
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,400
<i>So long, bad times.

116
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,400
<i>We're gonna shake it up. Break it up.
We're sharing light brighter than the sun.

117
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,000
<i>Hello, good times.

118
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,300
<i>We're here to stimulate,
eliminate, an' congregate, illuminate.


119
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,500
<i>We are here to change the world.

120
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,100
<i>We! Gonna change the world. We!

121
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,800
<i>We are here to change the world.

122
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,500
<i>Gonna change the world. Woo!

123
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,200
<i>So do surrender 'cause my
power's deep inside my soul.

124
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,500
<i>Sing it!

125
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,000
<i>We are here to change the world.

126
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,820
<i>We! Gonna change the world. Yeah, yeah.

127
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,100
<i>We are here to change the world.

128
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,300
<i>We! Gonna change the world. Woo!

129
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,700
My whip warriors!

130
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,400
Destroy him!

131
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
EO!

132
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,600
Let's go!

133
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,800
<i>Woo!

134
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,500
<i>We are here to change the world.

135
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,000
<i>We're gonna change the world, girl.

136
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:20,220
<i>We are here to change the world.
My brothers! My brothers!

137
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,000
<i>We're gonna change the world.

138
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,600
<i>We are here to change the world.

139
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,300
<i>We! Deep down in my fire.
Deep down in my soul, baby.

140
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,800
<i>We are here to change the world.

141
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,500
<i>We! Gonna change the world. Woo!

142
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
<i>Woo!

143
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,900
<i>We're sending out
a major love.

144
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,000
<i>And this is our
message to you.

145
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,820
<i>The planets are linin' up.
We're bringin' brighter days.

146
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,400
<i>They're all in line
waitin' for you.

147
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,000
<i>Can't you see?

148
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,000
<i>You're just another part of me.

149
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,700
<i>Another part of me.

150
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,300
Bye, bye.

151
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,800
<i>We're takin' over.
We have the truth.

152
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,300
<i>This is our mission
to see it through.

153
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,100
<i>Don't point your finger.
Not dangerous.

154
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:41,000
<i>This is our planet.
You're one of us.
