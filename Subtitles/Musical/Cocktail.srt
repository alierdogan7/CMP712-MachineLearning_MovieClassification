Your subscriber is out of reach.
He cannot be reached now. Try later.

3
00:06:19,496 --> 00:06:21,020
Ravi sir is with the clients.

4
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,359
He could not be reached by phone.

5
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:26,100
He will come only late.

6
00:06:29,005 --> 00:06:31,633
She came to the new play station.

7
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:33,902
She offers a treat as she got
the silver star for quarterly exam.

8
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,877
A play station and a bucket chicken.

9
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:39,613
Ask Ravi to call me. Ok.

10
00:07:01,271 --> 00:07:02,704
- Did you see my daughter?
- No!

11
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:15,741
She is standing there.

12
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,489
You are smart. I was afraid.

13
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,692
Looks cute, right?

14
00:07:32,135 --> 00:07:33,625
Uncle gave me this.

15
00:10:04,721 --> 00:10:05,710
Oh God!

16
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,929
Christ! You spoilt it.

17
00:10:15,798 --> 00:10:17,663
I wanted to give a surprise!

18
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,928
The same surprise always!

19
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,664
Why don't you change
it for sometime?

20
00:10:22,772 --> 00:10:25,605
I'm bored by acting as scared!

21
00:10:25,908 --> 00:10:27,671
Why did you cry out?

22
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:29,210
It fell down as you
gave me a shock!

23
00:10:29,312 --> 00:10:30,836
Are you bold enough?

24
00:10:30,947 --> 00:10:33,916
You should have
taken my photo then!

25
00:10:34,283 --> 00:10:37,912
The real face which scares off
the workers in this site!

26
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,386
Yet my black Forest is shattered.

27
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,117
I broke open the bakery
and brought here.

28
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,452
I remember when I sees it.

29
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,188
...as the title of the article
in the magazine!

30
00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:48,991
The memory of the cake shattered.

31
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:51,633
It is my heart
which is broken and shattered.

32
00:10:53,603 --> 00:10:55,901
See you! 2 minutes plan
of mine is there.

33
00:10:56,005 --> 00:10:57,302
It was quite a big plan.

34
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,638
I've toiled much to get this
knife and match box in the dark!

35
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:02,409
Hold it.

36
00:11:13,156 --> 00:11:14,020
Blow.

37
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:23,821
Not for me. Here.

38
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:30,668
Let us have it more tastier! Come.

39
00:11:36,813 --> 00:11:41,910
- Ammu!
- What is going on here?

40
00:11:42,151 --> 00:11:44,176
It is mom's birth day!

41
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,720
She was cutting the cake!

42
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:47,246
Why didn't you call me?

43
00:11:47,356 --> 00:11:49,654
Dad thought that you were sleeping!

44
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:51,192
- Didn't you sleep?
- No!

45
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,125
- Then? - I was making
my doll to sleep!

46
00:11:53,229 --> 00:11:54,253
Didn't your doll sleep?

47
00:11:54,363 --> 00:11:56,388
How can it be
when you make noise?

48
00:11:56,499 --> 00:11:59,627
We will give her sleeping pills!

49
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,962
What is your mom doing?

50
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,630
Ouch! She eats up the cake
which have fallen down.

51
00:12:03,739 --> 00:12:06,299
Don't eat the cake
which have fallen down?

52
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:11,277
Mom is a dirty girl!
Keep the knife here.

53
00:12:11,514 --> 00:12:13,209
Come. We shall go upstairs...

54
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:16,149
...and sing a birth day song for her!

55
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:08,593
You are below the shadee

56
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:13,570
e'ee meet down by the dreams.

57
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:18,178
Under the rain of your love

58
00:13:18,514 --> 00:13:23,213
e'ee get drenched with memories.

59
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:27,856
With our eyes,
we attained the language of mind.

60
00:13:28,257 --> 00:13:32,318
Time when you opened the blue window

61
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:36,158
e will tell the sweetness of the heart

62
00:13:36,332 --> 00:13:39,790
et has filled my heart with love

63
00:13:42,672 --> 00:13:47,200
You are below the shade

64
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:52,006
e'ee meet down by the dreams.

65
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:56,844
Under the rain of your lovee

66
00:13:57,053 --> 00:14:01,717
e'ee get drenched with memories.

67
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:40,156
Did Abheri tune
the wind sings caress you?

68
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:45,296
The light clouds in the dusk applied...

69
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:49,598
...dot on the foreheade

70
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,868
The heart filled with happiness

71
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,670
...the time when the tune has playede

72
00:14:54,777 --> 00:14:57,075
Who is the star searching?

73
00:14:57,179 --> 00:14:59,443
Is it the eye of the star?

74
00:14:59,548 --> 00:15:03,541
Yet we together will climb the steps

75
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:08,920
Above the sky blesses
us a virtuous lifee

76
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:13,459
You are below the shadee

77
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:18,425
e'ee meet down by the dreams.

78
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:23,261
Under the rain of your lovee

79
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:28,307
e'ee get drenched with memories.

80
00:16:02,912 --> 00:16:04,174
M. D is quite angry!

81
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,645
What did I do for that?

82
00:16:05,748 --> 00:16:07,306
He is asking the same!

83
00:16:19,495 --> 00:16:20,519
What is the solution?

84
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:25,363
The matter is a bit complicated, sir!

85
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:28,967
I am not interested
in the size of the problem

86
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,887
I am wondering which
engineering college gave your degree!

87
00:16:46,188 --> 00:16:47,553
- Sir! That is...
- That is?

88
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,418
You know what you have done?

89
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,199
The 18 storey building which was
built by us by the plan of sir!

90
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,543
The one of the 2 buildings is...

91
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:11,977
...The Heavenly Heights
of the Spectrum Constructions!

92
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:13,912
The other one is Bay
like tower of Metropolis

93
00:17:14,016 --> 00:17:15,108
The approach road is in the middle!

94
00:17:15,217 --> 00:17:16,115
What should be the width?

95
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,185
Sir! 12... It should be 12 meters!

96
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,919
What happened then?
What is the width now?

97
00:17:25,094 --> 00:17:26,186
10 meters

98
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,296
Did you see now?
Government has brought a stay now

99
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:33,362
What has to be done with this building?

100
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,436
Should it be demolished?

101
00:17:34,537 --> 00:17:37,973
The company is the loser
if we buy the plot! That's why

102
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,372
What now?
We are trying hard to avoid the loss

103
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,843
We can handle that problem!

104
00:17:44,013 --> 00:17:45,674
You have to do the job
which is given to you!

105
00:17:46,515 --> 00:17:48,210
Almost everyone in the firm...

106
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,750
Even Ravi sir is aware of the problem!

107
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:07,065
- Where is Ravi?
- He is in the cabin!

108
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,399
- He is in a meeting!
- Call him!

109
00:18:12,908 --> 00:18:16,400
The Approach Road is only 10 meters
which should be 12 meters!

110
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:20,179
I told already that a
couple of cents are to be added

111
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:23,512
Isn't it?

112
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,180
I gave you a written statement
duly signed already

113
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:28,319
Get the blue print here

114
00:18:40,936 --> 00:18:42,767
Isn't it 3 years old?

115
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:47,435
You told me once that your wife
has a cousin in the ministerial staff

116
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,568
...and he could handle this neatly

117
00:18:49,812 --> 00:18:54,215
He got a good amount for
changing 12 meters to 10 meters

118
00:18:54,783 --> 00:18:57,877
Those guys in the corporation
too got the bribe

119
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,615
Who is taking the
decisions of this kind?

120
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,660
But I have to talk to you only

121
00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:25,713
You too have to be vacated from here

122
00:19:33,155 --> 00:19:34,179
There is a way for that

123
00:19:34,556 --> 00:19:36,717
It is a little out of the box thought

124
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,185
There is money involved

125
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,522
In the long run
our company will have the benefit

126
00:19:43,232 --> 00:19:45,359
If come through Vallarpadam Terminal...

127
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:48,095
...Kochi will be better
than Visakapattanam Port

128
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,629
Even it could be better
than Mumbai Port!

129
00:19:51,874 --> 00:19:54,707
At the back side of our project... Here!

130
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,707
This is a land of 25cents

131
00:19:56,812 --> 00:19:58,609
It is with a Siva Subramaniyam!

132
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,144
We have to buy that plot

133
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:02,009
There was no access to his plot...

134
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,415
...as our structure was built up

135
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,351
There would be only
a little space for a scooter to go

136
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,548
We can buy it cheap now

137
00:20:08,657 --> 00:20:11,353
On the opposite side of
Siva Subramaniam's plot...

138
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,793
...on this side of the lagoon
it is the Vypin Cherai route

139
00:20:15,397 --> 00:20:19,527
If we construct a bridge
with our money for us to get there...

140
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:21,927
...the government will be lenient to us!

141
00:20:22,371 --> 00:20:24,339
Don't you know how to tackle that?

142
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:29,744
The bridge is the bonus
we offer the government

143
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:31,836
If the bridge is built
it'll be a short cut...

144
00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:33,642
...to Thrissoor without
touching the high way

145
00:20:33,882 --> 00:20:35,907
We could save one
third of the distance!

146
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,709
Government will be with us

147
00:20:39,755 --> 00:20:41,450
I'll ask dad to talk to the minister!

148
00:20:42,624 --> 00:20:45,991
This talk of ours should be
secretive between us

149
00:20:46,362 --> 00:20:48,853
Secrets are leaked out from inside

150
00:20:49,231 --> 00:20:51,825
I'm not sure if it is
the work of someone who went out

151
00:20:54,136 --> 00:20:56,229
The secrets should be between us till...

152
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,703
...the beginning of this bridge!

153
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:04,038
I was not worried if there
would a solution for this problem

154
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:09,409
If I go to dad after
everything is over...

155
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,145
...he will laugh at me!

156
00:21:11,787 --> 00:21:12,879
Before dad...

157
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:27,799
Dad!

158
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:31,071
You have to
complete it before you go

159
00:21:32,508 --> 00:21:33,668
Paru! Take the phone

160
00:21:37,312 --> 00:21:40,247
- Is your husband there?
- He is here. I'll give to him

161
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:44,718
No. It will be difficult
for him to understand what I say

162
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,519
Warn him not to bother others any more

163
00:21:49,358 --> 00:21:51,383
Your over smartness is good

164
00:21:52,428 --> 00:21:56,990
If he didn't play cool,
he will be dead

165
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,964
It was not there for sometime
and he has started again

166
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,033
- What is that?
- Threatening calls!

167
00:22:03,138 --> 00:22:05,572
Threatens to chop the hands and
legs or even get killed!

168
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,642
I doubt if it is your work...
giving money to others!

169
00:22:08,811 --> 00:22:13,475
- For what?
- For showing up before me

170
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:19,277
You women could only think this way

171
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:23,217
Lieut. Colonel Bharath
Mohan Lal has told...

172
00:22:23,325 --> 00:22:26,021
...that there should be women
in the army and other forces

173
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,956
They are very crooked minded

174
00:22:35,971 --> 00:22:39,998
Drink this fast.
You will become big only then

175
00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:43,540
I need not go to school
when I am a big girl, isn't it mom?

176
00:22:43,645 --> 00:22:45,704
No. We can go to the college

177
00:22:57,426 --> 00:22:59,724
Are you alone? Come

178
00:23:03,098 --> 00:23:04,827
- When did you reach?
- Yesterday!

179
00:23:06,001 --> 00:23:07,491
What's the secret behind this gift?

180
00:23:08,003 --> 00:23:11,700
Are you expecting a gift like this
next week for your birth day? No dear

181
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:12,831
You miser!

182
00:23:12,941 --> 00:23:15,034
Don't try to save the entire money
your husband earn

183
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:17,840
Spend some of it. Ammu is here!

184
00:23:17,946 --> 00:23:19,072
I didn't see you

185
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,350
Is it your mom only
keeping her body thin?

186
00:23:24,453 --> 00:23:27,217
- Go girl.
- When did you come?

187
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,147
Have you become thin a little?

188
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:34,022
We were talking about thatjust now

189
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,820
She was comparing you with her

190
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:39,995
When I came in the frame,
the weight has been balanced, right?

191
00:23:40,702 --> 00:23:43,000
Tell her a diet for her

192
00:23:43,238 --> 00:23:45,798
When I am here with a lot of flesh...

193
00:23:45,908 --> 00:23:47,466
...people will think that
I am making her to starve

194
00:23:47,576 --> 00:23:48,941
But you don't seem to become thinner...

195
00:23:49,044 --> 00:23:50,739
...as if you have given
a word to someone!

196
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:54,380
You are shedding
yourflesh for me too

197
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,173
Tomorrow is your party, right?

198
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:58,185
You can enjoy it without
any responsibilities...

199
00:23:58,287 --> 00:24:01,051
...being a wife and mother!

200
00:24:01,156 --> 00:24:02,521
She had a name before in the college

201
00:24:02,624 --> 00:24:03,716
Paru scaling tree

202
00:24:04,493 --> 00:24:07,394
Let my wife enjoy all freedom

203
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,357
So, take care.
I'll call you!

204
00:24:13,735 --> 00:24:15,566
Are you building flats like your dad?

205
00:24:15,737 --> 00:24:17,295
- No. It is a house.
- House?

206
00:24:35,524 --> 00:24:37,151
Are you ogling in the office hours?

207
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,761
James! A coffee! Tell me

208
00:24:43,765 --> 00:24:46,859
It's nothing. The launching of the
new project is tomorrow, right?

209
00:24:48,971 --> 00:24:52,805
The costliest project
of our company so far

210
00:24:54,977 --> 00:24:56,001
The dream project I started 2 years ago

211
00:24:56,178 --> 00:25:00,638
My dream project for which
I have spent my brain and mind

212
00:25:00,816 --> 00:25:03,114
When the project is on, I was out

213
00:25:04,286 --> 00:25:05,776
The Brahmin made you the project lead!

214
00:25:07,556 --> 00:25:09,581
You put the elder one
in your pocket when you came here

215
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,051
Now it is his son! Good!

216
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,561
What are you telling, Antony?

217
00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:21,828
I have no specific interest
in the Marine Mirage!

218
00:25:22,537 --> 00:25:24,437
The company instruct me
and I am doing it

219
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,570
That's all

220
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:29,240
I didn't know that
you had interest in this

221
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,174
You didn't tell me

222
00:25:32,481 --> 00:25:33,539
I will do a thing!

223
00:25:34,316 --> 00:25:37,683
I will tell Navin sir
to make you the project lead...

224
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,014
...afterthe company meeting!

225
00:25:43,725 --> 00:25:44,749
I'll talk to him

226
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:57,996
The night is very quiete

227
00:25:58,707 --> 00:26:02,473
e don't know when you wiee come

228
00:26:02,577 --> 00:26:07,241
The night is very quiete

229
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:08,981
e don't know when you wiee come

230
00:26:09,084 --> 00:26:11,712
Are you defeated you young sheep?

231
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,517
- I have won, dear!
- I give up buddy

232
00:26:15,757 --> 00:26:17,588
If he is there to play
it is a defeat for me

233
00:26:17,893 --> 00:26:19,656
He would wipe off the entire money

234
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:22,321
- What's the fun in that?
- Sit down there

235
00:26:22,431 --> 00:26:24,296
There is a peg more
You have it and go

236
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:29,098
Annamma is very strict
after the 2nd attack

237
00:26:29,204 --> 00:26:33,106
When I go home and sleep
she will come with the medicine

238
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,041
You won't die if you take a peg more

239
00:26:36,211 --> 00:26:40,147
- Cruel guy is well cared!
- Go

240
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:44,278
Brother! It is good playing!

241
00:26:44,786 --> 00:26:50,019
But watch Ravi
when he plays with this smarty!

242
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,353
What is it Davis brother?
We are just playing!

243
00:26:52,461 --> 00:26:54,088
My time is good and I win!

244
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:55,823
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

245
00:26:56,131 --> 00:26:58,258
Yourtime is very best buddy!

246
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,460
No matter if it is in the play
or in the business!

247
00:27:00,569 --> 00:27:03,265
The 70 cent land of
Blue Star Govindan...

248
00:27:04,172 --> 00:27:05,605
Near the Grow park!

249
00:27:06,308 --> 00:27:09,334
When you sold the land
forfifty rupees more...

250
00:27:09,444 --> 00:27:11,537
...Davis brother lost 20 rupees!

251
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,940
I mean 20 lakhs!

252
00:27:13,582 --> 00:27:16,608
Davis brother got the advance back!

253
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:20,210
But the matter was not ended up fine

254
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:26,751
It is a good thing
when saying about Time

255
00:27:26,928 --> 00:27:29,829
When it get shuffled up,
the King will...

256
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:31,796
...become Joker!

257
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,993
You better be as the
King rather than the Joker!

258
00:27:34,102 --> 00:27:36,730
What ever loss you have acquired
we can make it right

259
00:27:36,972 --> 00:27:39,338
For what? It is not needed

260
00:27:39,975 --> 00:27:46,073
It is all by my earnings
that I got in my life so far

261
00:27:46,515 --> 00:27:48,847
I have never asked my dad for anything

262
00:27:49,151 --> 00:27:49,981
How's that?

263
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:53,714
I wanted to get back
the money I've lost!

264
00:27:53,822 --> 00:27:55,983
I've boarded the bus from
Thrissoor with that in mind

265
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,527
You have a good job!
Isn't that enough?

266
00:28:00,028 --> 00:28:03,623
There are people who can
do the real estate business!

267
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:09,297
I like you very much

268
00:28:09,738 --> 00:28:13,435
It is not because of
Kaattoor kaaran Pathras!

269
00:28:13,675 --> 00:28:17,042
I was living in a single room
flat in the beginning!

270
00:28:17,145 --> 00:28:20,342
...with some comedies
in the Thrissoor accent

271
00:28:20,582 --> 00:28:23,608
...you have reduced
my sufferings to great extent

272
00:28:23,718 --> 00:28:25,151
That is not a trivial matter to me

273
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:28,151
I have that affection
and obligation for you!

274
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:32,553
You should not spoil it
with your nasty dialogue!

275
00:28:32,994 --> 00:28:35,019
Then the matter why
I am in the real estate!

276
00:28:35,397 --> 00:28:37,058
I have a daughter!

277
00:28:37,165 --> 00:28:39,133
My dad has not given me anything!

278
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:42,737
At least me...
That's the God's wish!

279
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,133
I like your reply

280
00:28:46,508 --> 00:28:50,342
If told in a soft voice,
the matter is very vicious!

281
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:52,144
Enjoy yourself buddy!

282
00:28:53,114 --> 00:28:57,107
You know that it is
dangerous to oppose me

283
00:28:57,686 --> 00:29:02,521
All you need a small bomb
which I have kept safe for you!

284
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:07,921
The song which is sung
for us by him daily, right?

285
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:11,897
After 2 drinks, he used to
say a Konkini obscene language

286
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,974
You can ask the meaning
of it when you want to

287
00:29:21,076 --> 00:29:23,840
See you! We shall meet tomorrow

288
00:29:37,392 --> 00:29:38,324
One minute

289
00:29:39,461 --> 00:29:41,895
No any recommendation!
Only a suggestion!

290
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,324
...for our project...
for another lead...

291
00:29:44,499 --> 00:29:45,864
Who has more interest than you?

292
00:29:46,101 --> 00:29:48,001
Antony is more interested!

293
00:29:48,303 --> 00:29:50,134
He can do better than me

294
00:29:50,505 --> 00:29:53,474
He has a basic taste in the
marine structures and the design of it!

295
00:29:56,111 --> 00:29:57,942
You have to take care of it yourself

296
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,138
I can't take any risk!

297
00:29:59,781 --> 00:30:01,510
When dad hands you over something...

298
00:30:01,616 --> 00:30:03,516
...he has something in mind!

299
00:30:14,496 --> 00:30:17,897
- Didn't I do what I could?
- You somehow managed it

300
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,760
You are smarter in that!

301
00:30:31,813 --> 00:30:35,613
I don't know exactly. Never mind
I'll call you on the way

302
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,810
I'll be there around noon, sir

303
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,421
Our chairman Krishna Murthy sir
who is Navin's dad

304
00:30:46,795 --> 00:30:50,526
...if he calls me to the guest house
a regional head like me...

305
00:30:52,701 --> 00:30:54,532
I should have to stay
there one day any way.

306
00:30:54,703 --> 00:30:56,534
Drinking with the men of the Brahmin!

307
00:30:56,638 --> 00:30:57,935
I have to hear what he says!

308
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:00,200
...that he started his life
as a porter in the market!

309
00:31:00,308 --> 00:31:02,139
...and the story of Haji Mastan
who became...

310
00:31:02,243 --> 00:31:04,336
...the big builder
in South India, 101st time!

311
00:31:04,646 --> 00:31:08,707
When it is dawn
Ravi Abraham will be the...

312
00:31:08,817 --> 00:31:10,842
...vice-president of the
Atrium Structures!

313
00:31:12,887 --> 00:31:14,718
So you have to go tomorrow!

314
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:17,653
Then I would cancel my kitty party!

315
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:19,124
I'll be here with our girl!

316
00:31:21,162 --> 00:31:22,720
It has been planned with Ansi!

317
00:31:23,098 --> 00:31:25,089
Don't consider me as a fool.

318
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,630
Do one thing!

319
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,626
When you were in bed
a girl came as a maid, right?

320
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,499
- What is her name?
- Sicily!

321
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:35,238
She can be with her!

322
00:31:36,077 --> 00:31:38,307
If so, I will drop her
on the way to office.

323
00:31:38,613 --> 00:31:40,240
Okay! I'll call her.

324
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,593
- Are you from Seva?
- Beatrice!

325
00:31:56,765 --> 00:31:59,131
Sicily have a test.
I came in her place!

326
00:31:59,234 --> 00:32:00,132
Come!

327
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,604
I was late because of the traffic block.

328
00:32:04,706 --> 00:32:06,139
No problem!
It is only getting ready here.

329
00:32:06,241 --> 00:32:08,801
- Where is the kid?
- Here.

330
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,146
- What's your name kid?
- I'm not a kid!

331
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,306
- Amitha Susan Abraham!
- It is nice!

332
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,188
- Ravi! Are you ready?
- Then what?

333
00:32:21,623 --> 00:32:23,113
It is you who needs a thorough make-up!

334
00:32:23,224 --> 00:32:25,988
- I need only a underwear, extra!
- You awful guy!

335
00:32:26,094 --> 00:32:28,062
Who selected you in that office?

336
00:32:28,163 --> 00:32:29,824
It is not Sicily.

337
00:32:29,931 --> 00:32:31,831
She is another girl... Beatrice!

338
00:32:34,069 --> 00:32:37,436
Something is wrong in her name.

339
00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:41,833
Who knows?

340
00:32:42,811 --> 00:32:43,835
Shall I give you a kiss?

341
00:32:51,853 --> 00:32:53,878
Feed lunch to her!
It is difficult.

342
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,750
Mom was saying
that I am very fat! Is it so?

343
00:32:57,859 --> 00:33:00,487
- Dad is perfect!
- Hear...

344
00:33:00,595 --> 00:33:01,823
She will say that.

345
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,056
Do you know who her heroes are?

346
00:33:03,164 --> 00:33:04,722
They are the fat men of the WWF!

347
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:06,994
They are not fat.
He is Kane

348
00:33:08,036 --> 00:33:10,596
You have spoiled.
Leave it.

349
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,199
Give a kiss to your dad!

350
00:33:18,713 --> 00:33:20,806
You know that Paru
is going for a party!

351
00:33:20,982 --> 00:33:23,507
However late it is,
you can go only after she returns!

352
00:33:23,618 --> 00:33:24,642
I got it.

353
00:33:31,893 --> 00:33:33,656
Keep the charger of the
mobile in the car.

354
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:36,196
You have not kept it there...
but I have kept it.

355
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:38,288
What should have I done
if you were not there?

356
00:33:38,533 --> 00:33:40,364
I have heard it already
Get in.

357
00:33:40,468 --> 00:33:42,436
When I wanted to give
a compliment, you are...

358
00:33:43,004 --> 00:33:44,096
Leave it, if you don't like!

359
00:33:53,148 --> 00:33:55,878
Will she be with Beatrice?

360
00:34:14,169 --> 00:34:16,069
Yesterday I told you
about the BP's post.

361
00:34:16,171 --> 00:34:17,468
I think I am bit greedy after it.

362
00:34:17,572 --> 00:34:19,199
But I'll get 80 per cent hike
if it is the post...

363
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,672
...of the Head of Operations!

364
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,402
We went and saw the flat
in Marine Drive once.

365
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:26,807
In projecting balcony into the sea!
You liked it very much!

366
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:28,971
I have to buy it.

367
00:34:30,218 --> 00:34:31,845
Do you still remember it?

368
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,920
I was telling just for fun!

369
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,646
What will be the life without any fun?

370
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:39,923
You know the architect Ajayan?

371
00:34:40,361 --> 00:34:43,296
He is the marketing head of there!

372
00:35:30,778 --> 00:35:33,872
My car has broken down!
Can I get a lift up to there?

373
00:35:36,684 --> 00:35:37,514
Get in.

374
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:50,296
I am going to City Center...
and I feel relaxed now.

375
00:35:50,932 --> 00:35:53,560
I have an appointment in
the Speed parcel service!!

376
00:35:54,202 --> 00:35:57,228
It is strike and hartal
on that day only.

377
00:35:57,605 --> 00:35:59,698
Not only today.
It is always there.

378
00:36:01,876 --> 00:36:06,643
- What is your name?
- Ravi... Ravi Abraham!

379
00:36:07,548 --> 00:36:11,211
- Is it your wife?
- Yes! Parvathy!

380
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,881
- So it was your inter
cast marriage, right? - Yes

381
00:36:18,192 --> 00:36:21,025
Where do you work?
I mean... yourjob!

382
00:36:21,863 --> 00:36:22,989
I work in Atrium Towers!

383
00:36:24,032 --> 00:36:27,798
- Is this the 20 story towers?
- 21 stories!

384
00:36:28,303 --> 00:36:30,396
Yes! I have come there

385
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:33,605
I didn't come there!
I had some work there

386
00:36:33,908 --> 00:36:38,072
I had a doubt
when I reached there

387
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:40,875
- Toilet?
- Yes!

388
00:36:41,049 --> 00:36:44,041
My friend was working there
at that time

389
00:36:44,152 --> 00:36:45,050
...on the third floor!

390
00:36:47,889 --> 00:36:49,379
My friend Santhosh from
Adakkaputhur's office!

391
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:52,787
...I went to his toilet!

392
00:36:56,397 --> 00:36:58,297
- Which is this car?
- Fortune!

393
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:00,633
A guy told me about a car!

394
00:37:00,735 --> 00:37:04,501
That's not this.
It is CRV... 2005 model!

395
00:37:04,872 --> 00:37:07,306
They are demanding
12 lakh rupees for that!

396
00:37:07,408 --> 00:37:10,775
- In my hand...
- 12 lakhs is quite cheap!

397
00:37:12,013 --> 00:37:14,106
I have applied in the bank for loan!

398
00:37:14,415 --> 00:37:17,475
- Lf I get that!
- Your car?

399
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:19,152
It is an old one! A '98 model!

400
00:37:19,387 --> 00:37:21,753
It creates problem at times!

401
00:37:21,923 --> 00:37:24,949
I don't know why.
We don't get together well

402
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,289
Don't laugh! There is a relationship
between human being!

403
00:37:29,564 --> 00:37:30,462
Take us for an example!

404
00:37:30,565 --> 00:37:32,328
We had been together
for only a little time

405
00:37:32,433 --> 00:37:33,730
But we have come closer in that time!

406
00:37:33,968 --> 00:37:35,333
Vehicles are also like that!

407
00:37:35,703 --> 00:37:37,000
There are a few people for example!

408
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:39,605
Even they are married 20 years ago...

409
00:37:39,707 --> 00:37:42,005
...they won't go together well
with their wives!

410
00:37:42,443 --> 00:37:44,741
I doubt my car and me are like that!

411
00:37:45,046 --> 00:37:46,206
...always creates problem

412
00:37:46,314 --> 00:37:49,181
It consumes more petrol adding
to the problem

413
00:37:54,889 --> 00:37:56,720
It is not towards left.
It is towards right

414
00:37:57,291 --> 00:37:58,986
City Center is towards the left

415
00:37:59,827 --> 00:38:01,727
No... It is towards the right!

416
00:38:01,963 --> 00:38:03,692
No, sir! It is this way

417
00:38:04,265 --> 00:38:06,631
Turn towards the right!

418
00:38:08,002 --> 00:38:10,971
I know it well. It is this way!

419
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,697
Turn towards the right

420
00:38:15,476 --> 00:38:16,340
What?

421
00:38:18,146 --> 00:38:19,443
I said to turn to the right

422
00:38:30,658 --> 00:38:31,886
Look straight and drive it

423
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,623
If I pull the trigger,
you will be dead right then!

424
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,324
You can only stop when I say to

425
00:38:41,369 --> 00:38:43,860
What? What do you want?

426
00:38:44,305 --> 00:38:47,536
I got it what I wanted to get Abraham!

427
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,739
Why not? Isn't it your dad's name?

428
00:38:59,687 --> 00:39:00,711
This call for you only.

429
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:06,189
I like smartness!
But only when I want it

430
00:39:18,005 --> 00:39:20,098
Is it Ammu? You!

431
00:39:21,676 --> 00:39:24,236
On the other end she is waiting
to hear mom's voice!

432
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:28,981
- Talk to her!
- Dear!

433
00:39:32,386 --> 00:39:33,353
Nothing dear

434
00:39:34,255 --> 00:39:36,223
I've reached Ansi aunt's house

435
00:39:37,191 --> 00:39:38,158
I'll come fast

436
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,224
Listen to aunt's words! Ok dear?

437
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,390
Don't make me cry too!

438
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,865
I want to talk to my daughter

439
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:51,135
You cannot be smart life long!

440
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:57,744
Beatrice is an expert in baby sitting!

441
00:40:04,285 --> 00:40:07,584
What do you want?

442
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:08,982
How much do you want?

443
00:40:12,293 --> 00:40:14,591
How much do you have with you?

444
00:40:15,029 --> 00:40:17,896
About 30-35 lakhs!

445
00:40:18,799 --> 00:40:24,829
No. You have 77,00,334 Rs

446
00:40:28,543 --> 00:40:32,172
The arithmetic between us
should be exact always!

447
00:40:48,729 --> 00:40:50,822
Give me the mobiles of both of you!

448
00:41:00,308 --> 00:41:03,402
Both are tapped. Yet...

449
00:41:07,315 --> 00:41:08,282
Parvathy can go now

450
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,317
It is ourjoint account!

451
00:41:11,953 --> 00:41:14,513
You need my signature too
to withdraw money

452
00:41:17,491 --> 00:41:18,788
Model wife and husband!

453
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,828
You have joint account
at the time when nobody trust others!

454
00:41:23,598 --> 00:41:24,963
One thing you have to remember!

455
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:28,168
Ammu is waiting for you there!

456
00:41:28,269 --> 00:41:31,102
Beatrice too is waiting
for my phone call

457
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:40,510
Ammu is an innocent girl.
Isn't it Parvathy?

458
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,342
You have to remind Ravi at times

459
00:41:56,564 --> 00:41:57,929
Ravi, who is he?

460
00:41:58,165 --> 00:42:01,464
- We should have noticed that Beatrice!
- I have got her from Seva!

461
00:42:01,569 --> 00:42:02,934
I asked you about it

462
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,799
She had a negative approach!

463
00:42:06,907 --> 00:42:08,397
- We shall buy a mobile!
- Why?

464
00:42:08,509 --> 00:42:10,807
- We will call the police!
- To call the police?

465
00:42:12,246 --> 00:42:13,406
Ammu is in his custody!

466
00:42:13,581 --> 00:42:15,412
How do we know
who else are behind him?

467
00:42:15,916 --> 00:42:17,110
What can the police do?

468
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:20,387
How can we get back Ammu
if at all police arrest him?

469
00:42:21,222 --> 00:42:22,849
We have to obey him, come

470
00:42:28,229 --> 00:42:29,821
Here. It is all in thousands!

471
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,633
Name Ravi Abraham...

472
00:42:37,738 --> 00:42:39,365
We didn't have the check!

473
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:40,565
We need cash withdrawal forms!

474
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:44,709
A pen?

475
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:07,260
Do you want to close the account?

476
00:43:07,368 --> 00:43:10,201
We don't intend to close our account
We want to withdraw the entire cash!

477
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,672
I want to consult the manager!

478
00:43:14,775 --> 00:43:18,142
Why? Why do you
consult your manager...

479
00:43:18,245 --> 00:43:20,611
...when I want to withdraw
my money which is in your bank?

480
00:43:20,715 --> 00:43:23,240
Is this your one minute banking,
you advertise?

481
00:43:23,951 --> 00:43:25,976
We can get money faster
from the money dealers

482
00:43:29,757 --> 00:43:31,725
Don't get panicky!
People are watching!

483
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,926
Go and sit in the car.
I'll handle this

484
00:43:34,161 --> 00:43:35,389
They are!

485
00:43:36,997 --> 00:43:38,294
Go

486
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:46,833
Ravi was tense

487
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:49,176
I'll wait here

488
00:44:07,261 --> 00:44:09,923
Your daughter was good
in drawing, isn't it?

489
00:44:17,505 --> 00:44:20,201
When problems affect our relatives...

490
00:44:20,775 --> 00:44:23,209
...we tend to lose ourselves!

491
00:44:23,511 --> 00:44:24,808
It has to be like that

492
00:44:40,494 --> 00:44:42,052
Why don't you give back Ammu?

493
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,693
You have the full amount in that!

494
00:44:45,332 --> 00:44:47,698
- Do I have to count it?
- No

495
00:44:48,002 --> 00:44:50,095
It is correct amount!
It is there what you have asked

496
00:44:50,337 --> 00:44:53,238
7700334 Rs.

497
00:44:55,209 --> 00:44:56,437
My earnings today!

498
00:45:27,775 --> 00:45:28,935
What are you doing?

499
00:45:38,552 --> 00:45:40,247
I will set you on fire
if you stop the car

500
00:45:40,688 --> 00:45:41,518
Start the car

501
00:45:53,467 --> 00:45:57,028
I was irritated when
I saw this much money!

502
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,233
Now, I am relaxed

503
00:46:00,207 --> 00:46:03,438
Call him and tell
that you will come late!

504
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,080
It's me Ravi...

505
00:46:15,589 --> 00:46:17,750
We will come... A little late!

506
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:19,959
Parvathy is not well

507
00:46:21,595 --> 00:46:22,789
No, we don't know the place!

508
00:46:23,564 --> 00:46:24,861
I'll call you when we come out of here

509
00:46:33,307 --> 00:46:35,207
Aren't you calling now?

510
00:46:35,843 --> 00:46:38,334
If not they will wait
for you there, right?

511
00:46:38,979 --> 00:46:42,142
Don't betray our parties!

512
00:46:48,956 --> 00:46:51,049
I don't think if I could come today

513
00:46:51,692 --> 00:46:54,593
I'll tell you. I'll call you

514
00:46:59,133 --> 00:47:01,294
Do you know what the time is?

515
00:47:02,136 --> 00:47:03,228
You should be hungry!

516
00:47:03,537 --> 00:47:05,767
There is a hotel nearby

517
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:07,837
We will go there

518
00:47:17,785 --> 00:47:19,343
The car wouldn't go forward now

519
00:47:19,787 --> 00:47:21,015
We will stop here

520
00:47:44,044 --> 00:47:46,740
- There is a hotel nearby this slum!
- You mean here?

521
00:47:47,982 --> 00:47:50,143
This place and the life here
are not suitable...

522
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:52,115
...to be seen always!

523
00:48:17,344 --> 00:48:19,710
TIPPU SULTAN HOTEL

524
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,794
Sir! Come and sit inside

525
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,932
Shall I serve you nuts?

526
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,506
Have tea! I will get it

527
00:49:00,921 --> 00:49:01,683
What do you want sir?

528
00:49:02,489 --> 00:49:03,285
What do you have?

529
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:05,085
Tell me what do you want!

530
00:49:06,593 --> 00:49:07,685
Do you have elephant fry?

531
00:49:07,795 --> 00:49:09,729
- What?
- Elephant fry!

532
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:11,993
- That is sir
- Porcupine?

533
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,593
That's why I've asked you
to tell what you have here

534
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:17,261
Tell me what you want
in the fish items!

535
00:49:17,438 --> 00:49:19,201
We have variety of fish dishes!

536
00:49:19,306 --> 00:49:20,739
Give us 5 minutes.
We will tell you!

537
00:49:23,911 --> 00:49:27,142
- Aren't you going?
- Where to?

538
00:49:27,781 --> 00:49:28,941
Don't you need money?

539
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,647
I've set fire to that!

540
00:49:32,486 --> 00:49:34,454
I didn't have any money already

541
00:49:35,022 --> 00:49:36,319
You have to pay the bill of here!

542
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:40,785
You are about to run away from here

543
00:49:42,129 --> 00:49:43,153
You have to travel very far!

544
00:49:43,597 --> 00:49:45,030
You need to fill diesel in your car!

545
00:49:45,466 --> 00:49:48,026
You have to eat food when hungry!

546
00:49:48,535 --> 00:49:49,559
You have to spend a lot of money!

547
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:54,173
Tell me what your plan is!

548
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,308
What wrong we have done forthis?

549
00:49:57,344 --> 00:49:58,572
We need an answer to that

550
00:50:00,881 --> 00:50:05,079
Is it? Won't you do
the matter I tell you?

551
00:50:07,454 --> 00:50:10,753
The men of now wouldn't
take any decisions!

552
00:50:14,461 --> 00:50:15,860
...at least for our daughter!

553
00:50:19,967 --> 00:50:21,867
Our daughter is in your hands!

554
00:50:22,669 --> 00:50:24,398
- Otherwise...
- You can't do anything!

555
00:50:25,305 --> 00:50:27,273
Don't play to the one
who has nothing to lose...

556
00:50:27,641 --> 00:50:30,667
...and who has a lot to lose!

557
00:50:31,378 --> 00:50:33,812
Nobody knows what he would do

558
00:50:35,516 --> 00:50:36,881
I'll give you half an hour!

559
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:40,113
You should bring the money...

560
00:50:40,821 --> 00:50:43,915
...or else you wouldn't
see Ammu anymore

561
00:50:44,224 --> 00:50:47,455
A small coffin will come
as home delivery!

562
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:52,758
- Where are we going?
- Look there

563
00:51:00,274 --> 00:51:01,901
Why don't we call somebody?

564
00:51:02,276 --> 00:51:03,436
How can I call?

565
00:51:03,544 --> 00:51:04,977
All numbers are in the mobile!

566
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:07,511
I don't remember any number!

567
00:51:07,681 --> 00:51:09,046
I don't remember even my office number!

568
00:51:09,883 --> 00:51:12,147
Whom do I call if I remember at all?

569
00:51:12,252 --> 00:51:13,412
Whom shall I believe?

570
00:51:13,921 --> 00:51:16,890
Will they come if I call
to a place like this?

571
00:51:17,191 --> 00:51:20,820
What to do?
Let us pledge this watch!

572
00:51:21,895 --> 00:51:24,921
- Anyone who is a money dealer?
- Go man

573
00:51:27,434 --> 00:51:30,460
Do you know any pawn shop?

574
00:51:31,572 --> 00:51:33,005
Who has to be pledged among you?

575
00:51:34,775 --> 00:51:38,506
- To pledge my watch!
- Is it your watch?

576
00:51:38,712 --> 00:51:40,543
Are you trying to make a fool of others?

577
00:51:41,415 --> 00:51:43,076
Is your cloth too to pledge?

578
00:51:48,222 --> 00:51:49,780
There is a bald man in that street

579
00:51:50,157 --> 00:51:53,786
Hakeems brother! He accepts even
the underwear of the foreigners!

580
00:51:53,894 --> 00:51:54,792
Go and have a look!

581
00:51:55,162 --> 00:51:56,424

There is a shooting nearthe church!

...it is a puppet dance of ourse

626
00:55:44,324 --> 00:55:47,885
Bogari! Long ago... not very long!

627
00:55:48,061 --> 00:55:50,495
People called it Beegalgari!

628
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:53,828
In'98 Renis Rehman...
you know well!

629
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,161
...the one who has computer business

630
00:55:56,336 --> 00:55:59,567
He went to Singapore and
found out that it is Bulgari!

631
00:55:59,673 --> 00:56:01,766
It has another name now... Boogari!

632
00:56:02,075 --> 00:56:03,440
I want to pledge it

633
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,703
Where are you now?

634
00:56:05,879 --> 00:56:08,643
Who will accept watch
these days to pledge?

635
00:56:08,748 --> 00:56:11,581
It was okay if it was Seiko
or Rico in the past!

636
00:56:12,419 --> 00:56:13,818
It is an original one!

637
00:56:15,088 --> 00:56:17,716
I can get you a duplicate one!

638
00:56:17,891 --> 00:56:21,190
Made in Beypoor!
You are talking about Boogari!

639
00:56:21,895 --> 00:56:23,385
Let it be gold or anything

640
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:27,125
If it is kept on my palm,
my veins will tell me...

641
00:56:27,234 --> 00:56:31,000
...that it is original!

642
00:56:31,171 --> 00:56:34,800
Or else, it would tell
that it is duplicate

643
00:56:34,908 --> 00:56:38,935
An Abdul Karim Haji is near Thrissoor!

644
00:56:39,179 --> 00:56:42,205
He took a few Gold smiths with him...

645
00:56:42,382 --> 00:56:44,350
...and went to Malaysia
to teach them to make watches!

646
00:56:44,551 --> 00:56:49,386
They made Titan and Citizen
watches and sold there

647
00:56:49,589 --> 00:56:53,081
In Kochi, people are posing
as businessmen seeing that.

648
00:56:53,193 --> 00:56:56,424
Those boys do now to prepare
the sample of these items

649
00:56:56,596 --> 00:56:59,895
Those watches are imported to Kochi!

650
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,828
Ok. No pledging!
What price will you give?

651
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:05,295
If it is 6000 rupees, I am ready

652
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:08,303
6000 Rupees!
It costs a lakh!

653
00:57:08,875 --> 00:57:10,775
You need not tell me the price of it

654
00:57:10,877 --> 00:57:13,368
It doesn't cost more if it gets old

655
00:57:13,613 --> 00:57:16,309
There is a costlier one with me
Do you want to see it?

656
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:18,780
The Diagano series!

657
00:57:19,586 --> 00:57:21,417
6000 rupees is not enough

658
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,751
There is no guarantee card!
There is no box!

659
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,449
There is no cover forthis

660
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:26,651
How can you ask me more?

661
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:31,060
- 6000 is too much!
- Ok! Give me 6000 Rs

662
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:40,131
I am strict as it is the first deal

663
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,502
I can take if you have any more items!

664
00:57:43,643 --> 00:57:47,670
The moving items in Kochi are
Redling and Boban Mercier only!

665
00:57:47,847 --> 00:57:49,144
You bring those items if you have.

666
00:57:49,249 --> 00:57:50,546
We can adjust the price!

667
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:53,045
- Do you want tea?
- No.

668
00:57:53,153 --> 00:57:55,121
Is there a short cut to
Tipu Sultan Hotel?

669
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:58,191
It is here only. There is
a road here along the canal!

670
00:57:58,291 --> 00:58:00,088
You go straight in that
road towards West!

671
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:03,757
It looks like an original one!

672
00:58:16,476 --> 00:58:18,376
See you Hamid!

673
00:58:24,451 --> 00:58:25,850
Give him the bill!

674
00:58:29,189 --> 00:58:30,747
2300 rupees!

675
00:58:32,392 --> 00:58:33,359
To whom forthese parcels?

676
00:58:34,027 --> 00:58:35,995
The people who need
are out side

677
00:58:36,229 --> 00:58:39,426
I heard that you asked for
elephant fry

678
00:58:39,532 --> 00:58:41,329
Now it is not available here

679
00:58:42,502 --> 00:58:45,198
Once when I was running
the shop in Nunjangodu...

680
00:58:45,305 --> 00:58:46,738
...I prepared that too

681
00:58:47,007 --> 00:58:48,269
I know that

682
00:59:09,863 --> 00:59:13,890
The green beans...

683
00:59:14,768 --> 00:59:17,999
It's for me
It's mine

684
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:22,338
Don't hit me
Give me

685
00:59:32,852 --> 00:59:34,149
One minute, Parvathy!

686
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:44,758
Address is in it

687
00:59:45,065 --> 00:59:46,726
You should handover it to there

688
00:59:47,367 --> 00:59:49,335
Can't you do that?

689
00:59:50,937 --> 00:59:53,906
- Me?
- Yes. A small favour

690
00:59:54,074 --> 00:59:55,041
Can't you do?

691
00:59:55,442 --> 00:59:56,568
You can do

692
00:59:56,743 --> 00:59:59,712
I know.
You like Ammu very much

693
01:00:00,747 --> 01:00:01,805
What is this?

694
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:05,985
It has to reach
Asiankara Achumama's house!

695
01:00:08,488 --> 01:00:09,978
What do you say Parvathy?

696
01:00:12,959 --> 01:00:15,655
I'll give it
I'll give wherever it is

697
01:00:16,062 --> 01:00:17,586
One phone call is enough

698
01:00:17,797 --> 01:00:20,027
I should know that you are there

699
01:00:20,266 --> 01:00:21,824
Don't do anything foolish!

700
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:42,014
Hey Ambi!

701
01:00:46,693 --> 01:00:49,059
Your child's life is in my hands

702
01:00:49,262 --> 01:00:52,095
Don't forget that
Mind your words

703
01:00:53,199 --> 01:00:55,565
Why are you here?
Any drinks?

704
01:00:55,668 --> 01:00:58,136
No, officially...
Why are you here brother?

705
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,532
I came here nearby...

706
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:03,603
I am his brother
Kalyana Krishnan

707
01:01:03,877 --> 01:01:05,742
Rukku aunty has come from Thanjavur

708
01:01:05,979 --> 01:01:10,507
Then sister... uncle called and
insisted me to go and meet her

709
01:01:10,617 --> 01:01:12,983
They gave some snacks

710
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:16,680
- Is he your friend?
- Yes, I am Ravi Abraham

711
01:01:17,056 --> 01:01:18,250
Are you a Christian?

712
01:01:18,458 --> 01:01:20,688
He resembles our Kannama's brother

713
01:01:20,794 --> 01:01:25,493
Same dress and shoes
but not the face

714
01:01:27,367 --> 01:01:28,527
I have no problem

715
01:01:28,635 --> 01:01:32,093
- I'll become companion to everyone
- We are busy now

716
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:33,739
I am too very busy
Leave it

717
01:01:34,007 --> 01:01:37,170
Seems you both started to go out
to enjoy the weekend

718
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:38,368
Yes, will you join with us?

719
01:01:38,545 --> 01:01:41,173
With pleasure. I was waiting
for an auto for long.

720
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:42,373
No one has stopped

721
01:01:42,482 --> 01:01:44,848
I've to give a person
one Jeevan Raksh policy

722
01:01:45,018 --> 01:01:48,044
- Will you go through that way?
- No problem. I'll drop you

723
01:01:48,221 --> 01:01:49,483
No brother! You go

724
01:01:49,689 --> 01:01:50,713
Keep quiet Ambi

725
01:01:50,824 --> 01:01:54,157
When your friend calls me affectionately
it will be a free lift

726
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:56,091
Then what? Move away!

727
01:01:56,196 --> 01:01:57,220
Not here
Go back side

728
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:59,261
- Can't you go back side
through this way? - No

729
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:01,661
It's old model, isn't it?

730
01:02:06,739 --> 01:02:09,503
Seems you are very happy
giving lift to him

731
01:02:10,009 --> 01:02:13,308
By god's grace the person who sat
inside, came as a ball into my court

732
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,970
Let me play with it

733
01:02:15,682 --> 01:02:17,673
Then you can play

734
01:02:44,477 --> 01:02:46,843
It is Cheeda! Made with rice.

735
01:02:47,247 --> 01:02:49,442
You are driving, isn't it?
Have it.

736
01:02:49,649 --> 01:02:50,581
No, I don't want.

737
01:02:51,217 --> 01:02:52,980
Rukku aunty has prepared it.

738
01:02:53,152 --> 01:02:55,552
Have it.

739
01:02:57,323 --> 01:02:59,223
How do you know him?

740
01:02:59,325 --> 01:03:00,952
You might have met him in the bar.

741
01:03:01,094 --> 01:03:02,789
I thought it already

742
01:03:04,731 --> 01:03:08,064
I am his brother.
It means cousin.

743
01:03:08,334 --> 01:03:10,393
What drink do you like?

744
01:03:12,138 --> 01:03:13,070
Whatever it is.

745
01:03:14,974 --> 01:03:15,804
Listen Ravi!

746
01:03:15,975 --> 01:03:18,136
His family was not in a great position

747
01:03:18,278 --> 01:03:20,542
His father retired from
the irrigation department.

748
01:03:20,647 --> 01:03:21,875
His mother was a house wife.

749
01:03:22,181 --> 01:03:24,376
He joined B. Sc in Victoria college.

750
01:03:24,484 --> 01:03:26,008
That time a letter had come.

751
01:03:26,185 --> 01:03:27,709
From Karagpur, llT

752
01:03:27,854 --> 01:03:31,722
That day I told him to join in IT
But he didn't listen.

753
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:34,086
He opted to take nuclear physics.

754
01:03:39,632 --> 01:03:41,327
I still remember now.

755
01:03:41,501 --> 01:03:43,298
When he was 10 years old...

756
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:44,935
During the Deewali
and Vishu festivals...

757
01:03:45,038 --> 01:03:48,530
...neighborhood children would
bring Sivakasi crackers to him

758
01:03:48,775 --> 01:03:51,744
He has a technique that
he makes explosives...

759
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:55,779
...using native medicine and
battery coal and Navasaram

760
01:03:56,182 --> 01:03:59,413
During Deewali festival, we hear
crackers sound in our street

761
01:04:00,186 --> 01:04:01,983
It blasts with a great sound

762
01:04:02,121 --> 01:04:05,716
Then crackers, Now it is the bomb
That's only the difference.

763
01:04:06,125 --> 01:04:08,059
He is the eldest in that house

764
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:09,819
Ranjani. She is his sister.

765
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:12,420
She is a lecturer in N.S. S college.

766
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:13,395
Will you keep quiet for sometime?

767
01:04:13,499 --> 01:04:15,899
What Ambi?
He is your friend, isn't it?

768
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:18,236
Where do you work?

769
01:04:21,074 --> 01:04:22,769
It is very famous company.

770
01:04:24,811 --> 01:04:26,244
I suffer with asthma

771
01:04:26,646 --> 01:04:29,240
Do you have any interest
in insurance policy?

772
01:04:29,382 --> 01:04:31,111
I am an insurance agent.

773
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:35,276
World has become very much spoilt.

774
01:04:35,388 --> 01:04:39,620
Wherever we go there are terrorist attack
bomb blast, Tsunami and earth quake

775
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:41,419
Ok, leave it.

776
01:04:41,561 --> 01:04:45,520
Are you going to bar
or any private place?

777
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:48,392
- Brother! It is not like that.
- No need respect

778
01:04:48,668 --> 01:04:51,432
We didn't drink together before.
It is right.

779
01:04:51,704 --> 01:04:53,672
Let's start today

780
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:58,238
Today is the new moon day
and Narakachathurdasi

781
01:05:04,717 --> 01:05:09,211
If you try to find me with
support of my brother...

782
01:05:09,756 --> 01:05:10,882
It won't happen.

783
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:13,488
There is nothing wrong if I try for it

784
01:05:14,093 --> 01:05:16,391
It's true
But it won't happen

785
01:05:18,731 --> 01:05:19,629
Yes.

786
01:05:22,135 --> 01:05:23,898
Has Ammu eaten anything?

787
01:05:25,938 --> 01:05:30,739
For your nasty behaviour,
it is your child who is suffering.

788
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:37,748
Brother, his child will
draw paintings well

789
01:05:39,919 --> 01:05:44,720
Brother! We have to go to some place.

790
01:05:44,957 --> 01:05:47,084
Brother! You give
your client the Jeevan raksha policy...

791
01:05:47,226 --> 01:05:48,557
...and get your drink, and wait there

792
01:05:48,661 --> 01:05:49,593
We'll come back soon.

793
01:05:49,896 --> 01:05:53,263
- We have some land dealings
- It's ok. I'll wait there

794
01:05:53,666 --> 01:05:54,724
You go and come back.

795
01:05:55,068 --> 01:05:57,593
I'll meet my client and get my drink

796
01:05:57,770 --> 01:05:59,203
...then I'll wait in thatjunction.

797
01:05:59,439 --> 01:06:01,339
Nearby, there is a beverage shop

798
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:04,609
Cash... I have only card with me.

799
01:06:04,911 --> 01:06:06,139
They won't accept that.

800
01:06:06,512 --> 01:06:07,809
Ambi, do you have money?

801
01:06:08,014 --> 01:06:09,914
You keep it on account.
I'll give you later.

802
01:06:12,685 --> 01:06:14,380
You get the food

803
01:06:14,754 --> 01:06:17,382
I am pure vegetarian.
You remember it.

804
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:20,088
If there is pork,
get me some.

805
01:06:25,698 --> 01:06:28,360
Ok. You can go.

806
01:06:32,105 --> 01:06:33,572
What happened to him?

807
01:06:33,773 --> 01:06:35,240
Seems there is something wrong

808
01:06:35,441 --> 01:06:38,274
I haven't seen him in this mood.

809
01:06:38,544 --> 01:06:41,172
Let it be anything.
I'll have two small drinks

810
01:06:44,117 --> 01:06:46,642
These people who fight with another
in the railway station...

811
01:06:46,819 --> 01:06:51,279
...and theater maintain a queue here

812
01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:53,688
What a discipline and humility!

813
01:06:53,926 --> 01:06:56,451
This is possible only for Malayalis.

814
01:06:56,963 --> 01:07:02,367
Here, Can I get a brand
brandy from Karnataka?

815
01:07:02,502 --> 01:07:03,366
I don't know.

816
01:07:03,903 --> 01:07:06,133
Then how will he come good?

817
01:07:06,339 --> 01:07:09,035
In your corporate line
ladder and snake play...

818
01:07:09,675 --> 01:07:12,303
...I am interested to know
how you win always

819
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:14,412
I was curious to know about that.

820
01:07:15,481 --> 01:07:18,609
Krishna Murthy sir's...

821
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:23,379
Now you are with Navin Krishna Murthy

822
01:07:24,223 --> 01:07:28,887
You made a play with my brother
to know about my aim.

823
01:07:29,328 --> 01:07:34,061
When you planned a play
with the Palakad Brahmin...

824
01:07:34,534 --> 01:07:37,697
You forgot you are going
to lose your own child.

825
01:07:41,107 --> 01:07:44,440
The plays are not clicking well.

826
01:07:48,247 --> 01:07:51,182
You think that you will
get a promotion...

827
01:07:51,918 --> 01:07:58,448
From the projector manager post
to operation head

828
01:07:59,592 --> 01:08:02,891
Navin Krishna Murthy. Your new boss.
You have him in your hands.

829
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:07,364
I have a plan to throw
you out from there.

830
01:08:09,635 --> 01:08:14,663
I've long hands than you imagine.

831
01:08:21,447 --> 01:08:22,937
Your company's...

832
01:08:23,449 --> 01:08:25,383
No yours...

833
01:08:28,454 --> 01:08:32,447
An open ticket for you
to lead a luxury life

834
01:08:33,459 --> 01:08:36,690
Over bridge which touches
Vypin Cherai route.

835
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:40,924
It is the blue print of that

836
01:08:41,167 --> 01:08:45,297
See, your dream project papers

837
01:08:49,842 --> 01:08:51,901
We should keep this secret between us

838
01:08:52,111 --> 01:08:55,012
If it goes out,
you'll be affected than me

839
01:08:58,017 --> 01:08:59,075
I know it sir.

840
01:08:59,318 --> 01:09:02,754
People will know about this,
the day when this project starts.

841
01:09:10,496 --> 01:09:13,897
How will you know this?

842
01:09:15,902 --> 01:09:18,530
What a foolish question!

843
01:09:19,138 --> 01:09:22,198
In this world, even the great
secrets will get leaked!

844
01:09:22,341 --> 01:09:25,742
Your corporate secrets are nothing!

845
01:09:26,512 --> 01:09:29,037
Do you know that building?
You should know that

846
01:09:32,218 --> 01:09:34,345
Your company's important enemy.

847
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:37,084
Don't be scared. This is only a copy.

848
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:39,789
Original papers are with Parvathy.

849
01:09:39,992 --> 01:09:40,788
Don't do it.

850
01:09:41,394 --> 01:09:44,454
Not only you are going
to spoil my career.

851
01:09:44,697 --> 01:09:47,461
...but also a good thing
which this town will get.

852
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:50,328
It is a relief for the people
from this traffic jam of this city.

853
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:53,769
Do you have interest in social service?

854
01:09:55,207 --> 01:09:56,435
It can't be said, when sees you

855
01:09:57,410 --> 01:10:00,436
Ok. Call and tell to Parvathy.

856
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:02,345
Don't give it to him.

857
01:10:02,748 --> 01:10:06,775
Before she reaches
to Cynotec MD Mathew's room...

858
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:18,395
Paru, it's me.

859
01:10:18,831 --> 01:10:20,264
Don't give that envelope to him.

860
01:10:20,566 --> 01:10:22,830
- Ravi, what are you saying?
- Don't give it to him.

861
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:24,937
We should do what he says.

862
01:10:25,204 --> 01:10:27,263
We can't take risk in Ammu's matter.

863
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:29,633
What else we should
lose more than this?

864
01:10:29,875 --> 01:10:31,240
Listen to me!

865
01:10:31,377 --> 01:10:34,039
I'll do whatever he says

866
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:20,656
In the life you don't get
the chances free always.

867
01:11:21,894 --> 01:11:26,297
In one day, your wife
too didn't trust you

868
01:11:27,133 --> 01:11:31,297
It's getting late. Let's go and wait
downstairs of that office.

869
01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:35,267
Else Parvathy will try
to show her smartness

870
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:36,599
Am I correct?

871
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:51,883
Are you upset?

872
01:11:52,792 --> 01:11:56,284
Those who don't run in life,
will be upset quickly

873
01:11:57,596 --> 01:12:01,589
You didn't get a chance
to run in your life.

874
01:12:03,002 --> 01:12:05,596
How is your daughter?
Is she adamant?

875
01:12:07,106 --> 01:12:08,403
Let's call her

876
01:12:21,187 --> 01:12:22,745
Connect the line to 106

877
01:12:23,956 --> 01:12:27,084
It's me. There is no problem, isn't it?

878
01:12:30,296 --> 01:12:32,764
Ok, I'll call you.

879
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:48,070
Parvathy is a nice dame, isn't it?

880
01:12:49,048 --> 01:12:51,573
Even she was roaming since morning...

881
01:12:52,384 --> 01:12:54,944
...she didn't lose her glamour.

882
01:13:04,830 --> 01:13:06,661
Paru, didn't I tell you
not to give the cover to him?

883
01:13:06,765 --> 01:13:08,323
It was a blue print of that bridge.

884
01:13:09,034 --> 01:13:11,298
- But he was...
- I called you after he said to me.

885
01:13:12,905 --> 01:13:16,466
How do I know that?
I was thinking about Ammu only.

886
01:13:16,909 --> 01:13:18,536
It was only that.

887
01:13:19,578 --> 01:13:22,274
Not only you spoiled my career
but also our life.

888
01:13:23,382 --> 01:13:25,145
Did I spoil your career?

889
01:13:25,351 --> 01:13:26,943
Was it me the reason for this?

890
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:30,046
I didn't say that you were the reason...

891
01:13:31,223 --> 01:13:33,555
You both can talk

892
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:34,815
I'll just come back

893
01:13:45,271 --> 01:13:46,795
I am not the reason for this.

894
01:13:47,173 --> 01:13:49,004
He is the reason for everything.

895
01:13:49,308 --> 01:13:50,673
First you understand that.

896
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:53,671
Whatever it is, I'll lose my job.

897
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:59,775
...and my good will
which I got by hard work...

898
01:14:00,052 --> 01:14:03,146
...and my career which helped
for you to live for you and the child...

899
01:14:03,355 --> 01:14:04,947
Everything will be lost at once.

900
01:14:05,758 --> 01:14:09,216
You shouldn't say that it is
your duty to help us to live

901
01:14:09,395 --> 01:14:10,862
It is your responsibility

902
01:14:10,963 --> 01:14:12,555
She is your child too.

903
01:14:12,665 --> 01:14:14,428
Is it? That's a new matter for me.

904
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:17,430
But it is for you to blame
me for a mistake...

905
01:14:17,570 --> 01:14:19,231
...you have done.

906
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,167
He too wished to happen this

907
01:14:23,342 --> 01:14:26,573
He wanted to create problems between us
than leaking the bridge plan

908
01:14:26,779 --> 01:14:29,145
Now he have achieved it so easily

909
01:14:32,251 --> 01:14:34,151
Ravi, he didn't take his phone.

910
01:14:34,453 --> 01:14:37,320
He called last time to some hotel room

911
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,323
I am sure.
Ammu will be there

912
01:14:39,491 --> 01:14:40,480
See the number.

913
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:46,664
No need code
Tell the number!

914
01:14:53,706 --> 01:14:55,503
Ravi, he is coming.

915
01:15:05,351 --> 01:15:08,286
Have you compromised with your problems?

916
01:15:10,689 --> 01:15:13,351
There is a book shop in
Rajiv Gandhi bus station

917
01:15:14,994 --> 01:15:17,394
You just keep it in the basement

918
01:15:17,663 --> 01:15:19,722
- I'll give you one hourtime.
- I can't do it.

919
01:15:22,134 --> 01:15:24,227
What? I didn't hear

920
01:15:24,637 --> 01:15:27,663
Paru, I saw his brothertoday.

921
01:15:28,073 --> 01:15:31,133
He was an innocent. But he didn't know
that his brother...

922
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:34,477
It's good for you
if you stop this matter here

923
01:15:34,713 --> 01:15:35,975
Not that.

924
01:15:36,315 --> 01:15:37,976
You have a good family

925
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:40,011
Your father is a retired
government employee

926
01:15:40,185 --> 01:15:41,982
Your sister is working as a lecturer
in Engineering college

927
01:15:42,221 --> 01:15:44,018
Then why you?

928
01:15:44,556 --> 01:15:45,682
Please leave him

929
01:16:03,175 --> 01:16:04,608
Ravi! What will be in this box?

930
01:16:04,710 --> 01:16:05,802
Let it be anything

931
01:16:05,911 --> 01:16:08,345
It is no use to us without
knowing Ammu's whereabouts

932
01:16:08,447 --> 01:16:09,675
Let's call from my phone

933
01:16:09,915 --> 01:16:11,678
No. Your phone may be tapped

934
01:16:11,917 --> 01:16:13,145
Let's make a call from the booth

935
01:16:13,485 --> 01:16:14,315
Hold it

936
01:16:32,871 --> 01:16:33,963
Queens lodge!

937
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:36,906
Where is it?

938
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:44,573
Brother! Wait for sometime.
We'll be back now

939
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:45,843
Come soon

940
01:16:53,425 --> 01:16:55,518
You are very lucky brother!

941
01:17:04,837 --> 01:17:06,065
Ravi! Where is the box?

942
01:17:06,305 --> 01:17:07,135
It is in the auto

943
01:17:07,239 --> 01:17:08,467
If he wants, let him take that

944
01:17:37,469 --> 01:17:40,097
Isn't it a wrong game?

945
01:17:42,141 --> 01:17:43,836
Your game is over

946
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:48,710
In your hometown,

947
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:52,710
If I wanted,
I would lock you in the car...

948
01:17:53,485 --> 01:17:54,975
But you should have thought...

949
01:17:55,354 --> 01:18:00,121
...why I kept my mobile in
your car without any reason

950
01:18:00,893 --> 01:18:04,659
You were caught in my trap.

951
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:06,390
Why do you do like this to us?

952
01:18:06,965 --> 01:18:07,932
Who are you?

953
01:18:10,836 --> 01:18:12,394
Didn't you hear
the story of Thakshakan?

954
01:18:13,572 --> 01:18:15,130
There is no image for the perils

955
01:18:16,308 --> 01:18:22,076
Wherever you hide,
it'll come and kill you

956
01:18:22,181 --> 01:18:23,478
Where is my daughter?

957
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:25,480
I'll tell you

958
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:29,413
Why did you stop with one child?

959
01:18:30,689 --> 01:18:31,781
Two children are enough

960
01:18:32,491 --> 01:18:35,619
If one child is lost
another one will remain

961
01:18:36,462 --> 01:18:37,486
Have you done the family planning...

962
01:18:38,797 --> 01:18:42,028
...or has Ravi fed up with you?

963
01:19:02,955 --> 01:19:03,785
It is Ammu's

964
01:19:06,325 --> 01:19:08,759
I won't stand your stamp.
Truly.

965
01:19:09,528 --> 01:19:12,326
But sometimes...

966
01:19:13,565 --> 01:19:19,663
This 6 feet height and
strong physique won't help you

967
01:19:25,043 --> 01:19:26,601
If you step a foot forward...

968
01:19:26,979 --> 01:19:30,813
...Beatrice will crush
your child's neck like this

969
01:19:34,253 --> 01:19:35,743
Parvathy! Do you get scared?

970
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:03,981
Don't close your eyes Ravi

971
01:20:04,483 --> 01:20:05,313
Look here!

972
01:20:05,684 --> 01:20:07,311
She is enjoying it

973
01:20:16,929 --> 01:20:20,262
Why don't you try modeling?

974
01:20:20,766 --> 01:20:22,666
You have a great figure

975
01:20:24,703 --> 01:20:26,068
As if you are chiseled out!

976
01:20:26,905 --> 01:20:27,803
You...

977
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:30,936
The moment when you
bring an end for this...

978
01:20:31,710 --> 01:20:33,803
The moment when you
bring an end to this play...

979
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:35,947
...l'll kill you

980
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:38,212
I will kill you

981
01:20:38,450 --> 01:20:44,082
That's why I've been waiting
forthe end of the play

982
01:20:44,957 --> 01:20:45,981
Can you bear it?

983
01:20:49,962 --> 01:20:52,522
Parvathy! He spoiled my mood!

984
01:20:53,231 --> 01:20:55,699
There is enough time to become dawn

985
01:20:56,735 --> 01:21:00,364
Now you can go to bus station, Abraham

986
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:03,707
Let Parvathy stay with me

987
01:21:04,209 --> 01:21:08,043
Else you would think
to show your smartness

988
01:21:09,214 --> 01:21:10,044
You can go

989
01:23:42,534 --> 01:23:44,559
Crackers then! It is bomb now!

990
01:23:44,669 --> 01:23:46,034
That's the only difference!

991
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:10,123
Don't run
My box!

992
01:24:10,629 --> 01:24:11,527
Catch him!

993
01:25:00,545 --> 01:25:04,948
One is forced to do the sin
even if he is not willing.

994
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:08,413
Why does this person do the sin?

995
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:12,718
Here I am doing the sin
but you get the punishment

996
01:25:13,225 --> 01:25:15,125
This is the world's nature, Abraham

997
01:25:15,961 --> 01:25:21,331
I have some remaining sins
to complete in this night

998
01:25:33,311 --> 01:25:36,747
I wish to see your corporate line that
make the client to get...

999
01:25:37,515 --> 01:25:38,379
...mesmerized with your skills

1000
01:25:39,484 --> 01:25:42,317
Have you seen that lady in black sari?

1001
01:25:44,022 --> 01:25:46,013
Go and bring her

1002
01:25:49,327 --> 01:25:50,351
That lady!

1003
01:25:51,663 --> 01:25:56,100
I wanted to see
how you fix a rate for her

1004
01:25:56,468 --> 01:25:58,163
Go and bring her...

1005
01:25:58,536 --> 01:25:59,901
...before crowd gathers for her.

1006
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:05,366
If you don't go
she'll go there

1007
01:26:06,144 --> 01:26:07,702
Do you want to see that?

1008
01:26:24,562 --> 01:26:26,325
- Are you coming?
- Any discount for the Onam?

1009
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:28,922
You rascal! Go and
ask to your mother

1010
01:26:29,034 --> 01:26:32,401
These rascals will come
to irritate me when it is dark.

1011
01:26:32,504 --> 01:26:35,268
Am I running a cloth shop
to offer you discount?

1012
01:26:43,181 --> 01:26:45,615
Hey saint! What am I seeing?

1013
01:26:45,717 --> 01:26:48,550
I thought when you stopped the car
that you wanted to breath some fresh air

1014
01:26:54,659 --> 01:26:57,287
Will you come with me?
I'll give you Rs 1000

1015
01:26:57,395 --> 01:27:00,159
Oh Jesus! What am I listening?

1016
01:27:00,265 --> 01:27:03,632
Are you fixing a rate for me?
It's a shame thing

1017
01:27:03,735 --> 01:27:05,430
If anybody listen it,
what will they think?

1018
01:27:05,737 --> 01:27:07,102
I will...

1019
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:10,635
What Elise! Seems you are always busy

1020
01:27:10,742 --> 01:27:12,767
Where did you put your mobile?

1021
01:27:12,944 --> 01:27:14,969
Let me live my life Franchise

1022
01:27:16,614 --> 01:27:19,105
Seems your range has changed

1023
01:27:19,217 --> 01:27:21,447
You are doing dealings
with rich people

1024
01:27:21,553 --> 01:27:23,646
Let me earn when there is
some market, Franchise

1025
01:27:23,755 --> 01:27:26,815
Then get ready. I've booked a room
in Metro. Let's go soon

1026
01:27:27,692 --> 01:27:29,250
How can I come now?

1027
01:27:29,761 --> 01:27:32,924
You go. I'll settle him,
then I'll come there by Raju's auto

1028
01:27:33,031 --> 01:27:34,658
What nonsense are you talking?

1029
01:27:34,766 --> 01:27:38,065
I've bought Raja whiskey
and beef biriyani for you

1030
01:27:38,503 --> 01:27:39,731
What shall I do for that?

1031
01:27:41,439 --> 01:27:44,203
Sir! Can you wait for 5 minutes?

1032
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:46,875
I'll finish his dealing and come soon

1033
01:27:47,512 --> 01:27:50,481
One more thing...
Some people will come with net!

1034
01:27:50,582 --> 01:27:54,018
Don't make trouble for you.
They have AIDS

1035
01:27:55,453 --> 01:27:56,886
I can't wait

1036
01:27:57,389 --> 01:27:59,516
- I'll give you Rs 1500
- What a man you are!

1037
01:27:59,624 --> 01:28:00,784
Haven't you ever seen women?

1038
01:28:00,892 --> 01:28:02,723
You go somewhere else

1039
01:28:02,827 --> 01:28:04,488
- I can't
- I will...

1040
01:28:05,397 --> 01:28:09,629
If you want, give me Rs 750
I'll come with you

1041
01:28:10,268 --> 01:28:12,099
You have a good personality!

1042
01:28:12,203 --> 01:28:13,636
Why don't you look for a better girl?

1043
01:28:13,738 --> 01:28:15,706
You have come to spoil my work.

1044
01:28:15,807 --> 01:28:16,899
Dear Franchise!

1045
01:28:17,008 --> 01:28:19,101
You go and watch a film!

1046
01:28:19,277 --> 01:28:21,973
Finishing his deal,
I'll come there soon

1047
01:28:22,147 --> 01:28:24,980
After months,
I've got this nice business

1048
01:28:25,417 --> 01:28:26,714
Don't make problem.
You go.

1049
01:28:28,153 --> 01:28:29,711
It'll be a bad day for you

1050
01:28:30,422 --> 01:28:32,754
Damn his Rs 1500!

1051
01:28:32,857 --> 01:28:34,688
Leave the car here
Let's go by auto

1052
01:28:34,793 --> 01:28:35,953
My man is there

1053
01:28:36,261 --> 01:28:37,091
No

1054
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:52,274
What is this sir?

1055
01:28:52,444 --> 01:28:53,741
Are you collecting people?

1056
01:28:56,781 --> 01:28:57,679
She is my wife

1057
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:01,548
You people behave in a strange way!

1058
01:29:01,653 --> 01:29:03,484
Last month there was a dealing like this

1059
01:29:03,588 --> 01:29:06,182
A wife and husband, and his friend

1060
01:29:06,558 --> 01:29:08,321
They gave me Rs 2000

1061
01:29:09,427 --> 01:29:11,395
He will be yourfriend

1062
01:29:12,230 --> 01:29:15,859
Sister! There was a bet
between him and me

1063
01:29:16,634 --> 01:29:18,693
I said you'll come if he asks you

1064
01:29:19,137 --> 01:29:20,434
But he said you won't come!

1065
01:29:20,805 --> 01:29:22,102
He has lost

1066
01:29:23,741 --> 01:29:24,833
What is this?

1067
01:29:24,943 --> 01:29:26,501
Am I a joker in your card game?

1068
01:29:27,078 --> 01:29:28,568
I wish I could go with Franchise

1069
01:29:32,283 --> 01:29:34,183
- Take this
- No sir!

1070
01:29:34,285 --> 01:29:36,583
I don't take my fees by sitting idle.

1071
01:29:37,288 --> 01:29:39,552
It is not your fee
It is for my pleasure

1072
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:41,759
Will you show yourjoy like this?

1073
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:43,020
But some people are there...

1074
01:29:43,261 --> 01:29:45,229
Shall I go sir?
See you

1075
01:29:53,071 --> 01:29:55,801
Why did you play this
cheap game with me?

1076
01:29:56,908 --> 01:29:58,466
After I entered the car...

1077
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:02,746
Did I give you any good reply
for your questions?

1078
01:30:11,322 --> 01:30:16,259
Bright moon eight that's heree

1079
01:30:17,629 --> 01:30:21,258
Can you guess where we go now?

1080
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:23,528
A wild guess

1081
01:30:24,969 --> 01:30:27,199
Can we see our daughter once?

1082
01:30:28,239 --> 01:30:29,797
Can we talk to her?

1083
01:30:31,943 --> 01:30:34,036
It's enough
if we hear her sound once

1084
01:30:34,746 --> 01:30:36,441
I'll do whatever you say

1085
01:30:36,748 --> 01:30:37,908
Trust me

1086
01:30:39,951 --> 01:30:43,853
In a man's life,
he tells lies to himself

1087
01:30:44,889 --> 01:30:48,188
Then how can I trust you?

1088
01:30:48,293 --> 01:30:52,423
Burning heart...

1089
01:30:53,264 --> 01:30:59,760
Bright moon eight that's heree

1090
01:31:18,223 --> 01:31:26,528
The eightning strikes
in the gardene

1091
01:31:26,631 --> 01:31:30,294
et is burning in the hearte

1092
01:31:30,802 --> 01:31:34,363
Red rays...

1093
01:31:35,006 --> 01:31:38,442
en the sand storm of fate...

1094
01:31:38,643 --> 01:31:44,707
...the goeden dream
which sheds the petaese

1095
01:31:45,817 --> 01:31:50,151
...in the eap of the naturee

1096
01:31:51,155 --> 01:31:57,890
...to beossom... where?

1097
01:32:00,164 --> 01:32:01,722
Parvathy! We've reached the place...

1098
01:32:03,167 --> 01:32:05,658
...where we get a conclusion
for our problems

1099
01:32:09,374 --> 01:32:11,001
Parvathy! You stay here

1100
01:32:11,776 --> 01:32:12,800
You get down Ravi

1101
01:32:27,191 --> 01:32:29,216
The person who you are
going to meet tonight...

1102
01:32:29,594 --> 01:32:32,290
...your boss, is inside there

1103
01:32:36,601 --> 01:32:39,900
Let's clear your today's problems here

1104
01:32:40,271 --> 01:32:43,502
If you think,
the story will end up here

1105
01:32:46,277 --> 01:32:47,437
What are you saying?

1106
01:32:47,612 --> 01:32:49,842
Me? To kill?

1107
01:32:51,149 --> 01:32:53,049
You would be scared to kill

1108
01:32:53,217 --> 01:32:54,616
But I am not

1109
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:59,679
Ammu and Parvathy just started
to live their life, isn't it?

1110
01:33:06,564 --> 01:33:07,861
Do you want to kill me?

1111
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:13,059
If you like to happen something
to Ammu my presence is not needed.

1112
01:33:13,771 --> 01:33:15,864
Beatrice is not the only one with me.

1113
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:18,142
You should have
understood that, isn't it?

1114
01:33:18,910 --> 01:33:23,108
You have a family with
mom, dad and sister...

1115
01:33:23,247 --> 01:33:24,612
Why do you do like this?

1116
01:33:25,316 --> 01:33:27,546
They are nothing before my goal!

1117
01:33:28,119 --> 01:33:29,882
As you said just now

1118
01:34:49,333 --> 01:34:51,961
How you are here?

1119
01:34:53,671 --> 01:34:55,229
Has it been changed now?

1120
01:34:55,873 --> 01:34:58,171
This is my house

1121
01:34:58,676 --> 01:35:00,439
I should have asked you that

1122
01:35:00,611 --> 01:35:02,442
How did you find this house?

1123
01:35:04,482 --> 01:35:07,315
I messaged you.
You got that, right?

1124
01:35:08,753 --> 01:35:11,187
- What message?
- What Ravi?

1125
01:35:11,556 --> 01:35:14,286
Don't you remember what you told me
when you called me in the morning?

1126
01:35:14,659 --> 01:35:17,822
You called me as boss and told me
that Parvathy is not feeling well

1127
01:35:18,129 --> 01:35:20,290
I'll come but I'll get a little late

1128
01:35:21,065 --> 01:35:22,498
Parvathy is not feeling well

1129
01:35:22,667 --> 01:35:24,032
You told me like that

1130
01:35:24,836 --> 01:35:27,805
I thought something was bugging you

1131
01:35:28,506 --> 01:35:31,407
I messaged you
my house address a little later.

1132
01:35:42,453 --> 01:35:44,614
Then I called you so many times

1133
01:35:47,825 --> 01:35:50,521
I didn't have my mobile

1134
01:35:50,895 --> 01:35:53,125
I thought you wouldn't
come today

1135
01:35:53,965 --> 01:35:58,334
Do you have a plan to give me a
surprise as you give to Parvathy?

1136
01:35:58,903 --> 01:36:00,131
That is your plan.

1137
01:36:04,408 --> 01:36:06,433
Why do you feel nervous?

1138
01:36:07,612 --> 01:36:09,239
Is it because it is my house?

1139
01:36:09,347 --> 01:36:11,076
By scaring the people...

1140
01:36:11,215 --> 01:36:17,176
...it had been a long time,
hiding in the lift and office rest rooms

1141
01:36:17,488 --> 01:36:19,251
...we enjoyed

1142
01:36:20,358 --> 01:36:23,225
But this house is only for us

1143
01:36:23,528 --> 01:36:29,433
Forthis day, you told so many
lies to Parvathy

1144
01:36:33,070 --> 01:36:36,301
For me, we...

1145
01:36:37,608 --> 01:36:38,472
We don't want this

1146
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:46,009
I know why you are out of mood.

1147
01:36:47,184 --> 01:36:48,811
Because of long drive,

1148
01:36:49,787 --> 01:36:53,223
...guilty feeling, every minute
that you are cheating Parvathy

1149
01:36:55,226 --> 01:36:56,921
Don't I have that guilty feeling?

1150
01:37:32,063 --> 01:37:33,826
You didn't see that, is it?

1151
01:37:34,198 --> 01:37:36,098
The surname in the end of my name

1152
01:37:36,601 --> 01:37:38,762
My husband
Venkatesh

1153
01:37:40,271 --> 01:37:41,363
Now where is he?

1154
01:37:41,606 --> 01:37:44,632
Didn't I tell you that
he went to Delhi this morning?

1155
01:37:44,742 --> 01:37:46,369
Else how could we meet here?

1156
01:37:46,677 --> 01:37:48,110
Could you imagine it?

1157
01:37:53,384 --> 01:37:56,353
What if your husband knows
about our relationship?

1158
01:37:58,055 --> 01:37:59,750
Why do you say so?

1159
01:38:03,828 --> 01:38:05,921
I can't imagine it.

1160
01:38:08,499 --> 01:38:10,126
My Ambi will get shattered.

1161
01:38:10,768 --> 01:38:12,531
Why are you saying this now?

1162
01:38:15,506 --> 01:38:16,598
He knows everything

1163
01:38:25,916 --> 01:38:28,316
My child is in his custody

1164
01:38:29,553 --> 01:38:30,850
He'll kill my child

1165
01:38:45,870 --> 01:38:46,768
I don't have...

1166
01:38:50,608 --> 01:38:54,510
I don't have another way
to save my child, Devi

1167
01:38:57,615 --> 01:39:01,051
It is the punishment to us
for the sin we have done

1168
01:39:01,752 --> 01:39:03,117
He wants that

1169
01:39:03,821 --> 01:39:07,951
I can't sacrifice my innocent child

1170
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:20,997
You don't have another way Ravi

1171
01:39:27,178 --> 01:39:30,147
I can't
I can't

1172
01:39:32,116 --> 01:39:34,880
- I can't kill her
- But I can

1173
01:39:35,519 --> 01:39:37,350
One death is sure

1174
01:39:38,055 --> 01:39:42,685
Her death is betterthan
the death of 6 years old child

1175
01:39:48,733 --> 01:39:49,757
I can't

1176
01:40:21,565 --> 01:40:26,332
Did you see
how much he loves you?

1177
01:40:32,443 --> 01:40:35,537
You would have many reasons to tell me

1178
01:40:36,247 --> 01:40:37,942
...a husband who always come late

1179
01:40:38,783 --> 01:40:42,947
Even if I am nearto you,
you lose the lusty nights!

1180
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:44,412
My busy work

1181
01:40:46,323 --> 01:40:47,483
Like many reasons

1182
01:40:48,893 --> 01:40:54,525
In the marriage relationship
justifiable things for any women needs

1183
01:40:54,765 --> 01:40:55,823
It might be correct

1184
01:40:56,267 --> 01:41:01,500
While spending long time in the office
it might happen naturally.

1185
01:41:02,273 --> 01:41:08,644
It was the admiring on a smart colleague
who solved problems in the office

1186
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:13,377
Then it changed as love for each other.

1187
01:41:14,018 --> 01:41:15,508
I can understand that

1188
01:41:17,288 --> 01:41:20,314
But it was not love.

1189
01:41:20,958 --> 01:41:25,224
I thought a moment that you wouldn't try
to kill her after meeting her

1190
01:41:25,863 --> 01:41:29,355
But you did it
This is not the friendship

1191
01:41:29,533 --> 01:41:33,526
It is enough for you the
warmth when you meet her

1192
01:41:34,104 --> 01:41:38,768
I thought about her
when you fixed a price for that tart

1193
01:41:40,244 --> 01:41:43,805
Before that tart who sells body
for her livelihood.

1194
01:41:44,248 --> 01:41:46,546
She appeared to my eyes
in a small position

1195
01:41:47,651 --> 01:41:49,141
She is called a tart

1196
01:41:50,521 --> 01:41:51,488
You too

1197
01:41:54,925 --> 01:41:57,519
You fixed a price for these two bodies...

1198
01:41:58,095 --> 01:42:01,861
But when I touched
your wife in the hotel room...

1199
01:42:02,433 --> 01:42:04,128
Do you remember how your face was?

1200
01:42:04,969 --> 01:42:06,664
Do you remember that pain?

1201
01:42:07,304 --> 01:42:09,033
By knowing that I am not here...

1202
01:42:09,139 --> 01:42:11,972
...you've come to make
romance with my wife.

1203
01:42:12,209 --> 01:42:14,769
Now I've spent
my entire day with you

1204
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:18,512
You rascal! Can you
imagine about my pain?

1205
01:43:05,162 --> 01:43:08,063
Where is my child?

1206
01:43:20,644 --> 01:43:22,043
She is safe

1207
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,040
She is in your house

1208
01:44:07,925 --> 01:44:09,085
Dad!

1209
01:44:22,906 --> 01:44:27,866
- Aunty and I played hide and seek.
- Is it?

1210
01:44:30,180 --> 01:44:33,149
Sleep dear!

1211
01:45:01,945 --> 01:45:02,843
No Ravi!

1212
01:45:10,621 --> 01:45:14,022
Paru, they together kidnapped
our daughter

1213
01:45:15,526 --> 01:45:17,118
She doesn't know anything

1214
01:45:17,761 --> 01:45:18,659
That means...

1215
01:45:19,163 --> 01:45:22,132
Ammu stayed safely in this house

1216
01:45:22,232 --> 01:45:26,066
Without knowing her dad
earned money and career for her

1217
01:45:26,437 --> 01:45:30,134
She didn't have any role in this game

1218
01:45:33,444 --> 01:45:34,934
I didn't get you

1219
01:45:35,312 --> 01:45:39,476
I know. I know everything

1220
01:45:57,668 --> 01:45:58,965
I am Devi's husband

1221
01:45:59,670 --> 01:46:01,501
I wanted to talk to you

1222
01:46:09,746 --> 01:46:14,979
He spoiled not only our money

1223
01:46:16,286 --> 01:46:18,914
...but our child's future too

1224
01:46:19,156 --> 01:46:21,317
Who said that our money
has been spoiled?

1225
01:46:26,430 --> 01:46:27,454
I'll wait here

1226
01:46:33,370 --> 01:46:35,736
No need of that.
I'll come tomorrow

1227
01:46:35,839 --> 01:46:36,931
Give the slip

1228
01:46:54,858 --> 01:47:00,524
So, your aim is to be spoil
my career. Isn't it?

1229
01:47:01,265 --> 01:47:04,359
I didn't do that too.
Your career is also safe

1230
01:47:14,077 --> 01:47:16,045
You didn't lose anything

1231
01:47:16,413 --> 01:47:20,179
Career, money and Ammu. Anything

1232
01:47:20,417 --> 01:47:23,978
You made me a fool
whole day and night

1233
01:47:36,266 --> 01:47:37,164
Well done

1234
01:47:43,240 --> 01:47:46,676
- You...
- Yes, we are...

1235
01:47:47,377 --> 01:47:50,005
We thought to make you
understand at least one day...

1236
01:47:50,113 --> 01:47:52,411
...how the pain is if a
loved person betray him

1237
01:47:52,516 --> 01:47:55,212
When he told everything to me...

1238
01:47:56,386 --> 01:48:00,083
...I felt ashamed on myself thinking...

1239
01:48:00,991 --> 01:48:03,459
...that I showed my affection
on you every moment...

1240
01:48:04,161 --> 01:48:08,791
...without knowing another women's smell
from you during the nights

1241
01:48:12,035 --> 01:48:13,866
You didn't lose anything

1242
01:48:15,038 --> 01:48:16,027
Except one thing

1243
01:48:17,541 --> 01:48:19,839
Awife who trust
your words blindly

1244
01:48:20,877 --> 01:48:21,969
You don't get her

1245
01:48:31,221 --> 01:48:32,779
I don't have to say any excuses

1246
01:48:35,626 --> 01:48:36,888
You can decide

1247
01:48:40,764 --> 01:48:45,463
I swear Paru, you fulfilled me
It has just happened

1248
01:48:48,505 --> 01:48:51,338
I am notjustifying myself

1249
01:48:53,710 --> 01:48:56,873
I knew already about the consequences
than what I got today

1250
01:48:57,648 --> 01:48:58,672
I should say

1251
01:49:00,417 --> 01:49:02,578
- You can decide.
- I don't know Ravi

1252
01:49:04,688 --> 01:49:06,986
Sometimes my mind would pardon you

1253
01:49:07,824 --> 01:49:09,985
Because it is not that
I can't find another way for me

1254
01:49:10,927 --> 01:49:13,828
Today you suffered a lot for my child...

1255
01:49:13,930 --> 01:49:15,955
...and agonized... disgrace

1256
01:49:17,067 --> 01:49:18,830
You have a good father in you.

1257
01:49:19,403 --> 01:49:20,836
Only for that

1258
01:49:27,911 --> 01:49:31,074
Ravi, shall I ask you one thing?

1259
01:49:32,516 --> 01:49:37,544
Will you forgive me
if I were in Devi's place?

1260
01:49:46,196 --> 01:49:49,427
AFTER ONE YEAR

1261
01:50:21,631 --> 01:50:23,656
Ravi, come

1262
01:50:28,372 --> 01:50:29,202
Come

1263
01:50:31,875 --> 01:50:32,773
Here is the cheque

1264
01:50:35,545 --> 01:50:37,035
This is a good thing

1265
01:50:37,347 --> 01:50:41,511
Some decent people will give
leftover food for his wife's birthday

1266
01:50:41,618 --> 01:50:44,781
But you gave big amount forthe trust

1267
01:50:45,956 --> 01:50:48,049
There is no share in this for me.
It is her wish

1268
01:50:49,226 --> 01:50:51,387
I've heard about this
hospital very much.

1269
01:50:51,495 --> 01:50:54,794
Patients get more affection
and care here than home

1270
01:50:55,365 --> 01:50:57,458
My senior Panikkar sirtells always

1271
01:50:57,701 --> 01:51:00,864
Patient needs peace than the medicine

1272
01:51:00,971 --> 01:51:02,131
We are just trying that

1273
01:51:08,445 --> 01:51:10,003
- Ravi!
- What dear?

1274
01:51:19,556 --> 01:51:21,114
This is a curious case

1275
01:51:21,224 --> 01:51:22,521
She attempted suicide

1276
01:51:23,093 --> 01:51:25,493
But it didn't happen.
Her husband saved her

1277
01:51:26,530 --> 01:51:28,430
She is alive. That's all

1278
01:51:30,934 --> 01:51:33,562
Everyone knows that she can't walk

1279
01:51:34,137 --> 01:51:35,798
But one man is there
who does not believe it.

1280
01:51:36,106 --> 01:51:37,198
It is her husband!

1281
01:51:39,242 --> 01:51:41,267
I just told about him.
He has come

1282
01:51:54,324 --> 01:51:56,417
I got the medicine which is prescribed

1283
01:51:57,527 --> 01:51:58,391
You got, isn't it?
