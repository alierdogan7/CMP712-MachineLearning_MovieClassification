that look.

anything emotionally.

with his liver.

you had made a mistake.

Oh, brother,
there's the hardest work in the world.

181
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,336
Maybe you'd be happier
back in town, Jim.

Of course, if you get that
agricultural urge again,

for a share of the table,

202
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:21,925

So long, Ted. Have a nice trip.

told me I was no good,

a job at a bargain basement and like it.

00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,449
Who?
Ted and Lila.

351
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,534
Hey, what's the matter?

352
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,661
Hello, Lila.
Jimmy boy.

353
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,121
How are you?
I'm so glad to see you.

354
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,206
It's good to see you.

355
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,749
I thought you
were alone, Jim.

356
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,250
Who's your friend,
and what's her hurry?

357
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,544
Don't ask me,
she's your friend.

358
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:19,712
Mine?
Yeah.

359
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:21,672
What is she afraid of?
Facing me?

360
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:22,799
Darling, I swear,
I never...

361
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:23,883
"Darling, I swear."

362
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:24,926
You lie...

363
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,260
You're on.

364
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,141
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

365
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,830
So this is Holiday Inn.

366
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,290
Yeah. Will be
if it ever opens up.

367
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,917
Well, why shouldn't
it open?

368
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,085
Well, I ain't one
to talk,

369
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,795
but you could probably
buy a half interest

370
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,839
in this place for
a barrel of apples.

371
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:06,676
Next train for
New York's at 7:43, if I can flag her down.

372
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,852
Say,
I'm looking for a job. Where's the boss?

373
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,646
Right here,
I'll be down in a second.

374
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,529
So, you're the big shot

375
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,156
that didn't know
whether Hanover and Dixon

376
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,740
were good enough
for your place.

377
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:33,161
(LAUGHS) Well, that wasn't
exactly hay you were throwing, either.

378
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,871
(MIMICKING LINDA)
"I'm Linda Mason."

379
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,080
(LAUGHS)
Merry Christmas.

380
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,206
Merry Christmas.
(LAUGHS)

381
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,167
All right,
you're a fake and I'm a phony.

382
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,543
And we're both soaked.

383
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,420
Are you hurt?
I'll check later.

384
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,797
Come on,
let's get out of this before you catch cold.

385
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:46,174
(CHUCKLES)
All right. Ooh.

386
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,552
Well,
here's what cooks.

387
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,761
Oh.

388
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,932
Well, this is darling.

389
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,767
Was it as large as this
when it was a farmhouse?

390
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,437
Yeah, it was built
by a fellow who felt cramped in New York.

391
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,272
He finally ran out
of lumber, though.

392
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,523
Oh, Mamie.

393
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:03,816
MAMIE: Coming.

394
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:11,407
MAMIE:
Is your names Mamie?

395
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:12,575
No.
No.

396
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,702
Get back in the kitchen.

397
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,167
My, my.
What's happened?

398
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,835
Oh, we had
a little accident.

399
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,921
Mamie, this is
Miss Linda Mason. How do you do?

400
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,464
Please to know you,
Miss Linda.

401
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:27,673
And these are
her children.

402
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:29,717
That's Daphne,
and that's Vanderbilt.

403
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,385
LINDA: How do you do?

404
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,888
Mamie,
will you take Miss Mason up to the guest room

405
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,389
and change her into
anything that'll fit her

406
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,891
while we get her
clothes dry, huh?

407
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,143
Sure thing, Mr. Jimmy.
Come on, honey.

408
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:42,980
I'll see about
getting the fire ready in the living room.

409
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:47,401
Is your names
Miss Linda?

410
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,861
No.
No.

411
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:51,614
(LAUGHS)

412
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:02,166
LINDA: I don't know,
it sounds like something you dream about at night

413
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,377
and it would
be wonderful,

414
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,712
then you'd wake up
in the morning and realize it couldn't work.

415
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:09,715
Oh, it'll work,
if I can sell the idea to some performers.

416
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,759
They seem to think
that profit sharing

417
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,761
means taking bows
on an empty stomach.

418
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,888
So that's why you're
not open tonight.

419
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:18,057
Well, I'm also,
sort of, particular

420
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,184
about the kind of
talent I'm gonna use.

421
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:22,937
Fifteen holidays a year.

422
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,146
Mmm-hmm.

423
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,773
You're a lazy fellow.

424
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,400
No, not especially.

425
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,694
Just have my own
ideas about living.

426
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:33,698
My father was like you.
Just a man with a family.

427
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:37,034
Never amounted to much,
didn't care.

428
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,452
But as long as
he was alive

429
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,247
we always had
plenty to eat and clothes to keep us warm.

430
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,999
Were you happy?
Yes.

431
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:48,212
Then your father was
a very successful man. Hope I can do as well.

432
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:50,965
Say, I came out
here for a job. Could you use me?

433
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,883
Well, I might find
a spot for you

434
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,260
in my first show.
What can you do?

435
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,470
I sing a little
and dance.

436
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,056
Couldn't guarantee
any salary at first,

437
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:01,183
right now I've got
the ledger and an iron lung.

438
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,811
I don't care if
you pay off in eggs, just give me a chance.

439
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,313
Well, let's see
what you can do.

440
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,731
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

441
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,649
You know,
I've written special music for each holiday.

442
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:12,153
This sort of gives me
a chance to keep a little promise I made to myself.

443
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,238
I said I was
gonna sing this song at the inn tonight.

444
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,115
(PLAYING PIANO)

445
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:22,079
(SINGING) I'm dreaming

446
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:26,959
Of a white Christmas

447
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:33,382
Just like the ones
I used to know

448
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:37,595
Where the treetops glisten

449
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,891
And children listen

450
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:48,939
To hear sleigh bells
in the snow

451
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:54,653
I'm dreaming

452
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:59,116
Of a white Christmas

453
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:06,916

Christmas card I write

454
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,964

merry and bright

455
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:23,974
And may
all your Christmases

456
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:28,145
Be white

457
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,194
I'm dreaming

458
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:39,698

Of a white Christmas

459
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:40,991

Just like the ones
I used to know

461

Where the treetops glisten.

462
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:50,668
Where the treetops glisten

463
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:51,877
And children listen.

464
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:56,006
And children listen

465
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,216
To hear

466
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,342
To hear

467
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:03,639
BOTH: Sleigh bells
in the snow

468
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:13,190

be merry

keep bringing

If you're burdened
down with trouble

If your nerves
are wearing thin

487
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,858
Park your load
down the road

488
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,695
And come to Holiday Inn

489
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,364
If the traffic
noise affects you

490
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,616
Like a squeaky violin

491
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:30,077
Kick your cares
down the stairs

492
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,371
And come to Holiday Inn

493
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:35,416
If you can't find
somebody who

494
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,543
Would set
your heart a-whirl

495
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,254
Get in your car
and motor to

496
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,923

of boy meets girl

If you're laid-up
with a breakdown

Throw away
your vitamin

Don't get worse

500
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,347
Grab your nurse

501
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:53,100
And come to Holiday Inn

(ALL CHEERING)

507
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:14,038
Happy New Year, Ted.

508
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,391
No!

509
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,687
Francois, have you
seen Mr. Hanover?

510
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:39,813
Twice, sir.

511
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:40,898
What happened?

512
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,191
The first time, sir,

513
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,526
he came
from his dressing room with a telegram in his hand.

514
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:47,529
He ordered
Scotch and soda, a bottle of each.

515
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,073
I know, I know.
What then?

516
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,658
The second time he came
from his dressing room

517
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,035
he asked which way
is Connecticut.

518
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,745
Connecticut?
Connecticut.

519
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:57,831
He said he has
a friend there who knows about women, too.

520
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,708
Why didn't you stop him?

521
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:01,627
How could
I stop him, sir, when I don't know

522
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,213
which way is
Connecticut.

523
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,841
Who said Holiday Inn
wouldn't work?

524
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,803
Well, we're gonna divvy up
a stack of important money tonight, huh?

525
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,054
Man, man.

526
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,223
I've got a landlady

remember anything? Uh...

I had a wire from Lila

telling me she's going
to marry some millionaire or something.

I had to talk to my old pal, Jim.

you know.

anything about her?

dancing with her.

If I ever dance
with her again,

653
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,929
I'd probably
recognize her.

of everything but finding her.

You were here,
why ask me how she looked?

656
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:40,729

the back. She was...

from the back again, I'd recognize her.

After I've danced
with her,

662
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:51,323
I'll just turn her around
for your okay.

describe her.

watching very closely.

666
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:04,711

Medium-built sort of a girl,

667
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,422
with a medium face.
She had a nice evening gown on

668

with a belt
in the back.

just like a girl friend of mine.

but her name was Consuela Stupkis.

She used to play
the pinball machine a lot down at the corner drugstore.

she was high man. Three weeks in a row.

we're going to find this girl eventually.

we'll be glad we waited for her.

we will find her on the next holiday.

going to do it like this.

going to look tonight.

703
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:45,622
Well, here's my punishment
for thinking so well of myself.

704
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:48,083
Oh, you'll have plenty
of times to be pretty.

705
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,834
I was just going to
ask you if you'd like

706
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,586
to be in the rest
of the shows out here.

707
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,837
You were?

708
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:55,173
Will you?
Will I?

Well, what's the matter?

712
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,560
I wish I didn't have
to work all the other days in the year

713
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,021
to make
these few possible.

714
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:13,400
Maybe a little later on
when we start doing better

715
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,736
you could stay out here
all the time.

716
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,405
Did you hear
what you just said?

717
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,948
Yeah.

718
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,700
Was it a proposal?

719
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:26,454
It will be when I get
a few bucks in the bank.

720
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:29,165
You're a strange duck.

721
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,251
You don't even
give me a chance to say darling

722
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,586
and throw
my arms around you.

723
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,339
Better save that
till you see the bankbook.

724
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:39,342
Well, I guess
I'm sort of engaged.

her again.

at her face this time?

No, we're still working
from the rear.

it was her? After all, she had an overcoat on.

if she had...

How do you know
she had an overcoat on?

00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:28,816
Well, she...
If she didn't,

820
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:30,151
look for a girl
with pneumonia.

Is it?

00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:43,456
That's our break.
We'll get here bright and early

826
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,624
and stay
until we find her.

827
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:45,792
We'll make
an announcement

828
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,168
asking her to
identify herself.

next time. No.

Say, fellas, how did
you like the show?

831
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:55,510
Well, we were so busy
we didn't see much of it, Jim. Why?

832
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:58,012
I thought the people
seemed to like the blackface routine.

833
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,222
Yeah, they did.

834
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,556
Don't you think
a blackface number

835
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:02,725
on St. Valentine's Day
would be novel?

836
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,685
A what?
It's no good, eh?

837
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,395
Just an idea I had.

talk Gus into buying a horseless carriage.

852
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,020
Oh, yes, temporarily.
Say, that reminds me,

I have a surprise
for you downstairs.

854

Well, thanks.
What reminds you?

855
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,777

You sound sweet,
but you don't make sense.

858
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,416
The inn is
so romantic looking.

859
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,085

I lent you

so willingly I part

to keep or break

before you start

00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:42,969
Be careful,
it's my heart

(SCATTING)

883
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:03,030
Be careful,
it's my heart

884
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:09,912
It's not my watch
you're holding, it's my heart

885
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:14,375
It's not the note
I sent you

886
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:18,504
That you quickly burned

887
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:21,841
It's not the book
I lent you

888
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:26,429
That you never returned

889
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:33,185
Remember,
it's my heart

890
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:42,111
The heart with which
so willingly I part

891
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:46,073
It's yours to take,
to keep or break

892
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:50,745
But please,
before you start

893
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:56,459
Be careful,
it's my heart

894
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,162
I'm sorry, Jim,
I couldn't resist it.

895
00:56:15,247 --> 00:56:17,414
Wonderful, she's prefect,
light as a feather.

896
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:18,916
You found her, Jim.
You're a pal.

897
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Yeah.

898
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:21,293
Young lady,
do you realize

899
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,045
that we've been
searching for you for weeks?

900
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:24,964
For me?
Yes, ever since...

901
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,050
The girl in
the flower shop.

902
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:29,718
Yes, Mr. Reed.

903
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:31,720
Where have you
been working since New Year's Eve?

904
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,013
Here.

905
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:35,850
Would you mind
letting me in on your secret?

906
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:37,101
Oh, it's no secret.

907
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:39,228
Ted Hanover is looking
for a new dancing partner

908
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:40,479
and we've decided
to give you the job.

909
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:41,772
Oh, here now.
Wait, just a minute.

910
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:43,190
Oh, no hard
feelings, Jim,

911
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:45,276
I don't
blame you for trying. She is wonderful.

912
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,819
I feel as if I've
known her for months.

913
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,863
Oh. Same old
feeling, huh?

914
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:51,490
Let's see,
Washington's Birthday is the next show.

915
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:54,243
That will give us
a week of rehearsals. We can open the act here.

916
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:56,620
DANNY: I'll take care
of the invitations. Strictly formal.

917
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:58,247
I'll get all
the newspaper boys from New York.

918
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:00,416
Now hold everything.
This is my inn,

919
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,543
and I am not running it
for a bunch of stuffed shirts.

920
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:04,295
What would you like,
the dungaree set?

921
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,964
Well, that would be better
than the bunch of chowder heads you drag in.

922
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,465
Maybe I can't
use the act.

923
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,342
Not use Ted Hanover?

924
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,136
Well, the show is
pretty well set.

925
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:14,263
You're in,
but he's out.

926
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:17,349
But you could change
the show for a special occasion like this.

927
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:20,186
Of course he could.
He's just trying to hide his gratitude.

928
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,438
Jim, you better think
up a number for us.

929
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:25,232
Well, just what do
you visualize, Ziggy?

930
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:27,484
Ah, let's see.

931
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:31,197
For Washington's birthday
I see, sort of, a romantic costume thing.

932
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,282
Naturally.
Something that just reeks

933
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:35,367
with grace and charm,
you know? Mmm-hmm.

934
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:38,662
I think the music should
be sweet and gentle to...

935
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:42,458
Well, to create the mood,
each time I take her into my arms and kiss her.

936
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,293
That's it.

937
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:47,630
Don't you think
it's getting a little stuffy in here?

938
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,898
(I CAN'T TELL A LIE PLAYING)

939
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:40,808
(SINGING) I could say
that you're homely

940
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:43,477
Just as homely as pie

941
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:46,397
But this is
Washington's birthday

942
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:49,525
And I've got to
say you're beautiful

943
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:53,237
'Cause I can't
tell a lie

944
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:56,198
I could say
that you're stupid

945
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:59,159
Nothing up
in your crown

946
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:02,079
But this is
Washington's birthday

947
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:03,497
And the truthful he

Of the cherry tree

949
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:08,752
Would look down on me
and frown

950
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:14,008
I could say that
I hate you if I try

951
00:59:14,426 --> 00:59:17,261
But I've got to say
I love you

952
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:20,597
'Cause it's February
the twenty-second

953
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:24,018
And I can't tell a lie

954
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:50,502
Hit it.

Well, honey, in spite
of what good old Jim tried to do to us,

975
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,983
your future
starts as of tonight.

976
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:20,068
Now where would you
like to go from here?

977
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,445
From here?
Yes.

978
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:24,698
New York, Havana, Rio?
We have our pick of engagements, you know.

979
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:27,201
But I can't
be your partner if you leave the inn.

980
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:31,246
Of course you can.
There's no reason for you to remain buried here.

981
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:33,332
There's a very
good reason.

982
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:37,085
I promised to be in
Jim's holiday shows for the rest of the year.

983
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,337
Ah, but he tricked
you into that

984
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:39,963
while he was
hiding you from me.

985
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:42,508
No matter how he did it,
I've promised.

986
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,637
Besides, well,
we're going to be married.

987
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:50,098
Married?
Now wait a minute, let's be fair.

988
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:51,725
He didn't
give me a chance.

989
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:53,560
After all,
I love you, too.

990
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:56,188
Linda, from the very
first moment we danced together,

991
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:59,149
I knew you were to be
the one girl in my life.

992
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:01,276
You didn't even
know my name.

993
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:04,905
Please. All right,
forget about me, then.

994
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:07,282
Forget about Jim,
think of yourself.

995
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:09,576
Here's your chance to do
the one thing you like best.

996
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:12,371
Not only for
15 days a year, but always.

997
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:16,625
Sorry, but I promised.

998
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:29,263
Well?

999
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,891
I guess I should apologize
for hooking up your number, huh?

1000
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:36,728
Oh, forget it.
I'm the one that should apologize to you.

1001
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:39,314
Here I've been trying
to take Linda away from you

1002
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:41,108
not knowing you two
were going to be married.

1003
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:42,359
Married?

1004
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:45,737
Yeah, aren't you?

1005
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:48,407
Yes, sure.

1006
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:51,868
I mean, naturally,
we're sort of engaged.

1007
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,495
Oh.

1008
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:58,250
Well, anyway, I've decided
to bow out of here. Linda's all yours.

1009
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:01,461
Well, you're
a pretty game guy to take it this way.

1010
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:05,007
Well, it's happened so often
I'm getting used to it, that's all.

1011
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:06,216
Good-bye, kid.

1012
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:07,509
A lot of luck, Ted.

1013
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:08,844
Thanks.

1014
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:18,103
How are we doing?

1015
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:20,731
Two minutes ago, I would
have sold my chances for a tired dime.

1016
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:23,233
But when a man is
surprised to hear that he's going to be married,

1017
01:04:23,318 --> 01:04:26,111
brother, that's when
I go to work with a clear conscience.

1018
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:27,988
Everything's good, huh?
Everything is perfect.

And when
they look you over

1025
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:35,514
I'll be
the proudest fellow

1046
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:01,016
I didn't exactly
expect the welcome mat,

1047
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,809
but I thought somebody
might say hello.

1048

Hello.
Thanks.

1049
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:07,606
What brings you here
on this bright and uninviting day?

1050
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:10,901
I've discovered something,
my friends, about life.

1051
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:12,778
Meaning what?

stay in the inn?

not to interfere, Ted.

I am a tired, lonely and unhappy man.

Well, at least give him
the benefit of the doubt.

plenty of doubt.

Yes, although
I wouldn't exactly say former.

I'm dancing with him
at the inn tonight.

But I... Doesn't he
have a new partner?

Oh, she won't be
there tonight.

Yes.

be a couple of men from Hollywood

for pictures.

will be missing this chance
to go to Hollywood.

1242
01:18:08,642 --> 01:18:10,601
Yes, although she can't
be very talented

1243
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:12,645

working at the inn.

Yeah.

I was afraid
the offer might

be too important
for you to turn down.

I can assure you...

1289
01:23:08,608 --> 01:23:10,151

is always interested

The idea behind it,
how it works, the special holiday songs.

is not for sale.

explained enough.

or should I have thrown in my shirt?

isn't he?

I've been dreaming about actually here.

1392

You make me feel
like a kibitzer.

1393
01:30:49,611 --> 01:30:52,529
Now don't misunderstand me,
I'm happy because this marriage means

1394
01:30:52,614 --> 01:30:55,115
that we can all
settle down and stop worrying.

1395
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,701
I wish
I had your confidence without your viewpoint.

1396
01:30:57,785 --> 01:30:59,620

until Linda and I

1397

are on that plane
bound for Yuma.

1399
01:31:02,957 --> 01:31:05,083
I don't know, except
I've been this close to marriage before

1400
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:06,376
only to wake up
next morning

1401
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:08,462
and find myself with
no bride and a hangover.

1402
01:31:08,546 --> 01:31:10,923

Yeah.

Well, we hadn't
set any exact time.

Have you seen Linda?

1414
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:38,867
No, no, not yet.
But, say, I saw your director,

1415
01:31:38,952 --> 01:31:40,994
he told me
he was shooting the finale tonight,

1416
01:31:41,079 --> 01:31:42,704
thought I'd like to see
how you make pictures.

1417
01:31:43,665 --> 01:31:46,083
He wouldn't...
You wouldn't like what they're doing tonight.

Well, I'm a dull,
technical sort of a fellow.

Perhaps if you'd wait
and see Linda tomorrow.

1422
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:56,718
Oh, no, I want to
see the finish.

1423
01:31:56,803 --> 01:32:00,222
The success of you
and Linda means a lot to me, pal.

you be yourself. What are you up to?

This is a beautiful hunk of welcome

comes coast to coast

a merry Christmas and a happy wedding.

live at the inn on Easter morning?

Silly, wasn't it?

Now I know he's
up to something.

No, we're treating Jim
like a poor country cousin.

He doesn't mean
any harm! No!

1437
01:32:26,874 --> 01:32:28,625
No, he just wants
to see Linda.

1438
