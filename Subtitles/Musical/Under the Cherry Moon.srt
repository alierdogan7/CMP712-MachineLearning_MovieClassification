Once upon a time in France,

3
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:12,020
there lived a bad boy
named Christopher Tracy.

00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:15,308

to Christopher. Money.

The women he knew
came in all sizes, shapes, and colors,

6
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:22,655
and they were all rich. Very rich.

7
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:27,119
Private concertos, kind words, and fun
is what he had to offer them.

8
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:31,623
Yes, Christopher lived for all women,
but he died for one.

9
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:36,499
Somewhere along the way,
he learned the true meaning of love.
