1
00:00:54,908 --> 00:00:55,875
Hi Rohit

2
00:00:57,077 --> 00:00:59,773
Here...? So suddenly...?
What are you doing here?

3
00:01:02,115 --> 00:01:07,918
Been thinking, Sanjay. Ever since
I came, something or the other...

4
00:01:08,856 --> 00:01:13,451
- ...has been going wrong.
- Wrong? I never noticed anything?

5
00:01:14,594 --> 00:01:19,657
Nor did I, until now.
But like I said...

6
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:25,135
- I've been thinking.
- And...?

7
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,909
After much deliberation,
I've arrived at a conclusion

8
00:01:33,113 --> 00:01:34,137
There's someone behind all this.

9
00:01:37,617 --> 00:01:41,678
Someone, who's trying... very
systematically, to break us up.

10
00:01:42,956 --> 00:01:44,821
What are you saying?

11
00:01:45,792 --> 00:01:48,158
There is someone who is determined...

12
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:54,365
not to let me marry Anjali

13
00:01:55,802 --> 00:01:56,268
Really?

14
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:00,435
Who might it be?

15
00:02:00,974 --> 00:02:03,602
I stopped him, I even tried
to reason with him

16
00:02:05,645 --> 00:02:07,772
For friendship's sake,
I told him

17
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,617
I posed obstacles for him,
I lay a thorn in his path

18
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:14,946
Like a blossom,
I even tried wilting

19
00:02:15,322 --> 00:02:18,780
Today, weds a friend.
But I am not happy

20
00:02:19,492 --> 00:02:21,460
Love, culminates into marriage.
But...

21
00:02:24,397 --> 00:02:25,625
why aren't you happy, Sanjay?

22
00:02:28,168 --> 00:02:32,468
You are the one who doesn't want
this wedding to happen

23
00:02:34,874 --> 00:02:35,636
But why?

24
00:02:38,078 --> 00:02:40,137
But there can be only one reason.

25
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:44,476
You are in love with Anjali.

26
00:02:52,025 --> 00:02:54,152
We're friends, you can tell me.

27
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:07,162
Yes, I love Anjali

28
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:20,179
Now that it's out in the open,
what to do?

29
00:03:26,493 --> 00:03:30,691
For you, it's quite simple.
Now that you know everything...

30
00:03:31,898 --> 00:03:37,530
I think you should just leave
and go back. To America

31
00:03:38,238 --> 00:03:39,865
- Really?
- Yes

32
00:03:40,407 --> 00:03:43,376
This is my story and Anjali's.

33
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,877
You just walked out of the woodwork

34
00:03:45,945 --> 00:03:50,041
You see? Anjali doesn't love you

35
00:03:51,818 --> 00:03:53,547
Anjali doesn't love me?

36
00:03:55,021 --> 00:03:58,388
Look, in her life you're merely
a stand-in for me

37
00:03:59,926 --> 00:04:00,722
In my stead

38
00:04:02,595 --> 00:04:04,563
She went to America on my say-so.

39
00:04:04,964 --> 00:04:06,556
The swing, that was mine too

40
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:14,733
You understand...? In my story and
Anjali's, you're my understudy

41
00:04:15,442 --> 00:04:18,411
Now that I'm here, what need for you?

42
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:22,573
So pack. Go back. To America

43
00:04:23,383 --> 00:04:29,754
You needn't inform anyone.
I'm around, I'll handle everything

44
00:04:32,859 --> 00:04:39,264
Sure, you'll handle everything.
But taking your advice...

45
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:43,257
- ...will be a bit problematic.
- Tell me, I'll solve your problem

46
00:04:43,636 --> 00:04:48,437
After all, I'm Sanjay, the magic man.
Say, what's your problem?

47
00:04:49,976 --> 00:04:53,275
Problem is, I too love Anjali

48
00:04:55,415 --> 00:05:03,948
I can't walk away from her, certainly
not when she's willing to marry me

49
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:08,388
That's her mistake, Rohit.
I'll make her happier than you can

50
00:05:11,197 --> 00:05:12,630
That's what you think, Sanjay.

51
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:20,303
But there's only one way to decide...
Where lies happiness for Anjali.

52
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:22,308
Where?

53
00:05:25,345 --> 00:05:28,314
You love her and I love her too.
Let's both try

54
00:05:30,383 --> 00:05:36,481
You don't ask me to go away,
I don't ask you to go away

55
00:05:38,057 --> 00:05:40,491
You can do whatever you wish

56
00:05:42,362 --> 00:05:47,163
If you succeed,
then Anjali was never mine

57
00:05:47,534 --> 00:05:52,335
If you fail to succeed,
then it's evident...

58
00:05:52,872 --> 00:05:55,340
that Anjali and I share
that eternal relationship

59
00:05:55,708 --> 00:06:00,168
Why are you wasting your time?
You're a nice guy

60
00:06:01,381 --> 00:06:05,181
What's with Anjali?
You'll find scores of girls

61
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,850
No Sanjay. There's only one Anjali

62
00:06:14,561 --> 00:06:17,530
And she can belong to
only one of us

63
00:06:18,565 --> 00:06:21,193
Whose? Only time can tell

64
00:06:22,735 --> 00:06:31,871
I got one advantage. I'm marrying her
In a week's time

65
00:06:35,081 --> 00:06:36,548
You're running out of time

66
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:44,383
I got 22 years behind me.
You're the one lagging way behind

67
00:06:46,326 --> 00:06:49,386
- You lose.
- We'll see

68
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:23,814
I warned you! The planetary alignment
for the engagement was inauspicious

69
00:08:24,023 --> 00:08:28,153
The boy isn't to blame.
He is influenced by the illusions

70
00:08:29,028 --> 00:08:31,656
We got to know in time. Else...

71
00:08:33,366 --> 00:08:37,166
I'd rather this isn't discussed

72
00:08:39,105 --> 00:08:41,335
Without discussions,
how do we arrive at conclusions?

73
00:08:44,877 --> 00:08:48,836
Am I not to be given a chance
to defend myself?

74
00:08:55,888 --> 00:09:07,527
What you saw was true, yet not true.
I did it, but I wasn't my self

75
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:15,373
Such was the circumstance,
such was the ambience...

76
00:09:17,076 --> 00:09:20,375
I thought, if so many people
are trying to make me happy...

77
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:25,974
I ought to join them
lest they take it otherwise

78
00:09:29,088 --> 00:09:31,215
I could've walked out...

79
00:09:34,427 --> 00:09:35,894
and left them heartbroken

80
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:44,733
But in my folly I've broken the heart
of the man who took me for a son

81
00:09:50,777 --> 00:09:52,074
Well what are the facts, Uncle?

82
00:09:55,281 --> 00:09:58,079
Fact is, you saw me disgrace myself

83
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:04,419
But there's another truth.
No one means more to me than Anjali

84
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:13,922
Far bigger truth, Anjali trusts me,
wants to spend a lifetime with me

85
00:10:17,637 --> 00:10:22,267
And yet another truth, Uncle.
You took me for a son

86
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:34,943
But can I ever be your son?
If I were, you would've forgiven me

87
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:54,970
If you will not touch me in pardon,
I shall never be able to face myself

88
00:10:58,678 --> 00:10:59,303
Never

89
00:11:15,728 --> 00:11:19,357
You can even face the Sun

90
00:11:22,568 --> 00:11:25,366
After all, I have taken you for a son

91
00:12:03,242 --> 00:12:07,975
- What happened?
- Don't worry, everything's fine

92
00:12:08,581 --> 00:12:15,180
- Uncle has forgiven Rohit
- I knew Rohit would bring him around

93
00:12:16,489 --> 00:12:19,219
That's what Rohit is like, isn't he?

94
00:12:25,498 --> 00:12:30,936
Sanju, in all these days,
you still haven't told me?

95
00:12:32,271 --> 00:12:33,363
How do you find Rohit?

96
00:12:35,107 --> 00:12:43,515
Tell me. It's one big decision
I took for myself. What do you think?

97
00:12:44,317 --> 00:12:49,414
Am I right? Tell me Sanju
how do you find Rohit?

98
00:12:55,861 --> 00:12:57,089
Rohit is a nice boy, Anju

99
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:03,602
Great guy. He'll make you happy

100
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:16,180
What did you do to bring Papa round?

101
00:13:18,317 --> 00:13:19,147
Fell in love with you

102
00:13:22,088 --> 00:13:24,454
- What do you want?
- Love

103
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,385
Couldn't find it at the
bachelor's party?

104
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,869
I never imagined, you'd
admit defeat so soon

105
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:55,812
You praised me to the skies
Honestly, I was surprised

106
00:13:57,056 --> 00:14:01,425
How to explain this? Deep inside this
scoundrel of a Sanjay Malhotra...

107
00:14:01,894 --> 00:14:04,988
there lives this nice, noble
Sanjay Malhotra too

108
00:14:06,432 --> 00:14:11,529
But it takes Anjali's tears
to draw out the nice guy

109
00:14:13,406 --> 00:14:18,207
Like you, he is also a fool
being honest, being truthful

110
00:14:19,145 --> 00:14:25,675
But it's only a matter of a few minutes
and those few minutes are over

111
00:14:28,754 --> 00:14:33,418
Which leaves this Sanjay Malhotra
cunning, conniving

112
00:14:35,761 --> 00:14:41,063
So wipe that smile off your face
The war is on

113
00:14:45,838 --> 00:14:49,069
So this is going to be even more fun
And guess why?

114
00:14:52,411 --> 00:14:54,879
Tomorrow... my relationship with Anjali
will have run the course of 3 months.

115
00:14:56,282 --> 00:15:00,548
I'm going... to take her out.
She says, impossible

116
00:15:01,587 --> 00:15:02,815
and I say, you have your magic-man

117
00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:07,885
- He will bring you to me
- What makes that interesting?

118
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:16,564
Your Anjali is about to beg of you
and how will you refuse her?

119
00:15:18,838 --> 00:15:25,641
That'd be interesting? Besides
the wedding is only 6 days away

120
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,842
Only six days.

121
00:15:29,815 --> 00:15:34,500
In six days...
the earth spins around six times

122
00:15:45,531 --> 00:15:48,762
Keep spinning your planet
let me make a world for myself

123
00:15:52,071 --> 00:15:53,333
My wedding... is six days away

124
00:16:03,883 --> 00:16:06,681
Enough of wordplay
Six days...?

125
00:16:24,403 --> 00:16:26,598
Neither the car nor I
can get an inch ahead

126
00:16:29,008 --> 00:16:30,475
From here you walk alone

127
00:16:33,979 --> 00:16:37,278
You're nervous,
your heart is pounding

128
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,545
Because you don't know
what's about to happen

129
00:16:41,587 --> 00:16:45,717
What might he do?
And what should you be doing?

130
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:49,159
Heart misses a beat?

131
00:16:56,669 --> 00:16:58,864
My heart would, too...
were I in your place

132
00:16:59,371 --> 00:17:01,566
And what'd you do?

133
00:17:04,677 --> 00:17:07,805
For a moment, imagine
being in love with me

134
00:17:13,652 --> 00:17:18,351
For a moment, let me imagine
I'm in love with you

135
00:17:20,192 --> 00:17:22,456
And what would you do?

136
00:17:23,195 --> 00:17:28,531
In that moment, I would've
tried to live a lifetime

137
00:17:30,135 --> 00:17:33,161
Tell me, what would you do?

138
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,263
I...

139
00:17:39,845 --> 00:17:48,014
would walk up to you, without taking
my eyes off yours... like this

140
00:17:48,654 --> 00:17:52,055
- I'd keep looking at you...
- Then...?

141
00:17:55,027 --> 00:18:01,455
Your eyes would hold mine
your hands would be in mine

142
00:18:02,668 --> 00:18:06,604
- And your breath upon my breath
- And...?

143
00:18:08,407 --> 00:18:13,743
And I'd carry you away with the wind
to the rustle of leaves...

144
00:18:14,914 --> 00:18:19,544
and bathe you in a lake of dew
and in a moment stilled...

145
00:18:21,287 --> 00:18:26,247
- I'd whisper in your ears...
- Whisper... what?

146
00:18:28,327 --> 00:18:31,660
- Whisper...
- What?

147
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:34,428
It'd be...

148
00:18:36,335 --> 00:18:40,362
Be it for even a moment
give me your love...

149
00:18:40,806 --> 00:18:48,906
even if you're false

150
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:42,494
"Silken waves of breeze"

151
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:51,340
"Come embrace me"

152
00:20:20,472 --> 00:20:25,034
"Our desires are alive
and so are we"

153
00:20:31,216 --> 00:20:36,654
"Don't let this distance be"

154
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:51,960
"At wind's caress won't the
blossom be fragrant?

155
00:21:52,531 --> 00:21:57,491
"How can I give you my fragrance?"

156
00:21:58,003 --> 00:22:02,667
"The budding blossom is shy"

157
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:07,710
"Then this shyness is more
like punishment"

158
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:13,641
"Why are you so fervent?
It's only a little wait"

159
00:22:13,852 --> 00:22:19,222
"Even a moment's wait
is cruelty"

160
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:24,122
"Our desires are alive
and so are we"

161
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,700
"I wanted not to speak out"

162
00:23:13,512 --> 00:23:17,881
"But I couldn't hold my silence"
"Yet I haven't had my say"

163
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:23,885
"Be it whatever you tell me
or whatever you won't..."

164
00:23:24,423 --> 00:23:28,883
"but don't look so lost"

165
00:23:29,194 --> 00:23:31,628
"Come what may..."

166
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:34,421
"just listen to your heart"

167
00:23:34,633 --> 00:23:36,726
"Whatever is heartfelt..."

168
00:23:37,102 --> 00:23:39,662
"just tell me"

169
00:23:40,372 --> 00:23:45,400
"I'm yours,
I swear by you"

170
00:23:45,844 --> 00:23:50,304
"Our desires are alive
and so are we"

171
00:23:56,688 --> 00:24:01,625
"A silken breeze winds..."

172
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,597
"let's draw closer"

173
00:24:07,432 --> 00:24:12,096
"Our desires are alive
and so are we"

174
00:24:18,243 --> 00:24:23,271
"Don't let this distance be"

175
00:24:50,909 --> 00:24:52,137
Help

176
00:24:56,348 --> 00:24:57,372
I just fell off a tree

177
00:25:05,891 --> 00:25:06,880
Hurts

178
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,223
Why is the car going backwards?
Anju...?

179
00:25:14,433 --> 00:25:17,630
Rohit! What are you upto?
I'm going to get killed

180
00:25:25,944 --> 00:25:28,504
Let me sleep, Ria.
No office today

181
00:25:32,584 --> 00:25:33,516
Sanjay, where are you?

182
00:25:38,824 --> 00:25:41,918
Why is everyone staring at me?
I'd like to see Sanjay

183
00:25:47,899 --> 00:25:50,766
- In bed till ten? Like always!
- Ria, you...?

184
00:25:52,004 --> 00:25:52,868
Yes, I

185
00:25:54,439 --> 00:25:59,035
Darling, will you please
tell these people how we're related?

186
00:26:00,312 --> 00:26:02,041
Didn't I tell you
he'd come running?

187
00:26:06,218 --> 00:26:08,550
Ria! What are you doing here?

188
00:26:08,787 --> 00:26:10,220
I thought I'd surprise you

189
00:26:10,589 --> 00:26:12,887
Didn't I tell you
he'd be happy to see me?

190
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:18,058
This is Ria
And Ria, this is...

191
00:26:18,263 --> 00:26:23,895
H.P... V.P... Lucky... A.J.
And that's Raj

192
00:26:24,469 --> 00:26:29,497
I've been introduced to them
and everyone here knows me

193
00:26:30,609 --> 00:26:37,014
Darling, you're too much!
You haven't told them that we...

194
00:26:37,649 --> 00:26:39,173
- We...?
- Boyfriend - Girlfriend

195
00:26:41,887 --> 00:26:46,483
And you've been having this affair
for the last 8 months

196
00:26:47,459 --> 00:26:48,949
So she's that
"little sister" of mine?

197
00:26:49,294 --> 00:26:54,163
- And she has no one but you?
- And you have no one but her?

198
00:26:54,466 --> 00:26:54,932
No...

199
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,769
- Here for Anju's wedding...
- And left your heart in Bombay?

200
00:27:00,272 --> 00:27:05,073
- With his real girlfriend!
- So he calls every day to tell her...

201
00:27:05,277 --> 00:27:11,113
- Oh I miss you, darling.
- Darling...?

202
00:27:11,483 --> 00:27:17,945
I see! So dear nephew, is this your
love story... nice to meet you

203
00:27:19,191 --> 00:27:25,619
- Try your best cover, but we know
- Anyone else knows more than me

204
00:27:25,831 --> 00:27:26,456
Darling

205
00:27:26,665 --> 00:27:30,965
Why are you shying away?
She's a beauty

206
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:34,602
- Given a chance...
- Would you...?

207
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,737
Smart, good-Iooking

208
00:27:39,277 --> 00:27:41,370
Shall we... H.P...?

209
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,815
The journey must've been tiring.
Take rest

210
00:27:49,087 --> 00:27:53,786
- May we excuse ourselves?
- As soon as Anju arrives...

211
00:27:54,092 --> 00:27:56,151
- I will send her directly to you
- No, no...

212
00:27:56,661 --> 00:28:00,097
- She will be glad to meet Ria
- Sure, she'll be glad

213
00:28:04,202 --> 00:28:08,662
- I'm here, everything will be fine
- Why have you come here?

214
00:28:11,176 --> 00:28:16,170
Raj, will you please
take my luggage in?

215
00:28:17,149 --> 00:28:21,017
Yes darling...
I mean to say... Ria

216
00:28:24,356 --> 00:28:26,347
Shall we... darling?

217
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:29,822
Darling, my foot!
What rubbish

218
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:34,965
Go on, laugh some more
Shut up, will you?

219
00:28:38,203 --> 00:28:41,104
You've ruined my game!
Everything was so perfect

220
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,904
The wedding is only 5 days away!
Why did you have to do this Ria?

221
00:28:47,612 --> 00:28:50,775
To help you, stupid! I'm here
for your own good

222
00:28:50,982 --> 00:28:55,612
I just saw what good you're upto!
Do you realise what you've done?

223
00:28:56,488 --> 00:29:00,219
My bachelor's party cost Rohit far less
than what your stupidity has cost me

224
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:05,093
- Darling...!
- Have you had your say?

225
00:29:07,933 --> 00:29:11,232
- You're in love with Anjali, right?
- What rubbish! I'm in love with you

226
00:29:11,436 --> 00:29:12,403
- Darling!
- Sanjay...

227
00:29:12,604 --> 00:29:14,162
- Darling...
- Sanjay, I'm serious

228
00:29:17,442 --> 00:29:19,342
When did you discover
you're in love with Anjali?

229
00:29:22,981 --> 00:29:28,476
You realised, when you saw someone else
walking into Anjali's life

230
00:29:29,454 --> 00:29:32,514
When you saw someone else getting close
to Anjali, you realised...

231
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:39,693
how close you are to her.
And just like you...

232
00:29:41,066 --> 00:29:46,265
Anjali has never seen you
with another girl

233
00:29:46,605 --> 00:29:48,163
- So...?
- When Anjali sees me with you...

234
00:29:48,373 --> 00:29:49,340
Anjali should know too, no?

235
00:29:49,474 --> 00:29:53,843
She might reciprocate what you felt
when you got news of her wedding

236
00:29:55,313 --> 00:29:57,440
You understand, darling

237
00:29:57,816 --> 00:30:01,775
Oh... darling

238
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07,448
Anjali... this is Ria

239
00:30:11,329 --> 00:30:16,028
Sanju, will you step out for a moment?
I got to tell you something

240
00:30:17,335 --> 00:30:19,826
Sure, go along
I'll join you

241
00:30:23,241 --> 00:30:24,640
Her luggage is in the kids' room

242
00:30:38,923 --> 00:30:43,292
- Kapoor? Who's Kapoor?
- Mr. Kapoor in Mumbai

243
00:30:43,762 --> 00:30:48,165
Runs a big advertising agency. Last year
at one of his parties... I met Ria.

244
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:49,929
You never even told me?

245
00:30:50,302 --> 00:30:53,601
- Did you tell me about Rohit?
- I told you about my wedding

246
00:30:54,105 --> 00:30:56,505
I'm not marrying her yet.
I'll let you know when it happens

247
00:30:57,208 --> 00:30:59,608
You're going to marry her... this Ria?

248
00:31:00,245 --> 00:31:04,341
Why what's wrong with her?
She's smart, she's sexy, beautiful

249
00:31:08,386 --> 00:31:11,844
What do you mean, why?
You won't marry her and you won't

250
00:31:12,123 --> 00:31:15,320
- I've spoken. Now do what you want
- Okay

251
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:20,359
- And by the way, what's she doing here?
- She's here for your wedding

252
00:31:24,836 --> 00:31:27,862
You're my friend, you invited me.
She's my friend. In turn...

253
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,638
- Why did you invite her?
- May I not have a guest?

254
00:31:32,844 --> 00:31:34,869
Girlfriend! If I invited Ria,
are there any problems?

255
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,445
No, she's fine

256
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:44,079
- You don't even know her
- I don't even want to know her

257
00:31:44,723 --> 00:31:46,384
Worse, she's an eyesore.

258
00:31:47,025 --> 00:31:49,050
If you say so...
I can accommodate her in my room

259
00:31:54,632 --> 00:31:57,123
- Jealous?
- Why should I be jealous?

260
00:31:57,836 --> 00:32:03,570
Because after you
she's the only other friend I have

261
00:32:03,775 --> 00:32:07,233
Don't you ever compare me with her

262
00:32:13,618 --> 00:32:19,955
"Are you the Moon in full bloom
are you a star?"

263
00:32:20,592 --> 00:32:28,431
"Whatever you be,
by God you're incomparable"

264
00:32:32,637 --> 00:32:35,697
That's my face pack commercial

265
00:32:38,376 --> 00:32:41,539
- Modelling must be fun!
- Show us a catwalk

266
00:32:41,746 --> 00:32:42,872
Right away

267
00:32:47,819 --> 00:32:48,444
Nice prop

268
00:32:49,988 --> 00:32:54,288
- But won't help
- Let's see

269
00:32:59,597 --> 00:33:02,657
H.P. You still haven't
given me the pendant

270
00:33:03,168 --> 00:33:07,571
Who can refuse you?
Here you are

271
00:33:14,145 --> 00:33:20,948
Papa, Uncle, looks like you forgotten
all about a wedding just 3 days away

272
00:33:21,586 --> 00:33:24,316
- So what do we do?
- Are you asking me?

273
00:33:24,956 --> 00:33:26,924
Didn't Mr. Verma call you?

274
00:33:27,425 --> 00:33:30,087
Papa, the jeweller is on the phone.

275
00:33:30,895 --> 00:33:33,193
Am I supposed to organise my wedding?

276
00:33:33,431 --> 00:33:37,128
No, that's my lot.
Excuse me, we got work to do

277
00:33:40,104 --> 00:33:41,332
Shall we...?

278
00:33:50,181 --> 00:33:53,776
- Uncle, have you nothing to do?
- Oh yes...

279
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,284
You know, such a lot to do
about the wedding... excuse me

280
00:33:58,389 --> 00:34:03,190
- You're forever organising weddings...?
- Yes

281
00:34:03,528 --> 00:34:10,491
- And you still haven't found your girl?
- I'm sure I'll find someone...

282
00:34:10,768 --> 00:34:14,761
say one of your cousins?
Someone who's yet to marry...?

283
00:34:15,707 --> 00:34:23,375
I haven't a sister, but they say
I've come of age

284
00:34:23,882 --> 00:34:27,613
- They must be right...
- Uncle, there's work to be done

285
00:34:38,229 --> 00:34:41,392
- May I help you?
- No thanks, son

286
00:34:46,771 --> 00:34:51,299
What with the arrival of the new star
everyone's after her

287
00:34:52,844 --> 00:34:56,109
- Sanjay is very lucky, isn't he?
- How come...?

288
00:34:56,548 --> 00:35:01,918
- Finding someone like Ria...
- Actually I find it strange

289
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:06,652
- I never imagined someone like Sanju...
- Would like someone so modern?

290
00:35:09,294 --> 00:35:15,426
For someone who lives in Bombay
could Sanjay like anyone else?

291
00:35:15,733 --> 00:35:20,432
- You're cosmopolitan too. From America
- I'm different

292
00:35:21,306 --> 00:35:24,833
I always wanted someone simple.
Like Anjali

293
00:35:26,411 --> 00:35:29,869
But Sanjay's choice...
got to be Ria

294
00:35:34,986 --> 00:35:38,285
- They look great together, no?
- Yes, great

295
00:35:38,656 --> 00:35:43,787
I say, let's give them a wedding
the same day as us

296
00:35:44,462 --> 00:35:48,956
He's right! Besides, we are
the only relatives Sanju has

297
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:52,295
My point! So what the point
putting off a nice thing?

298
00:35:54,238 --> 00:35:56,206
But you must teach me
cheese omelettes

299
00:35:56,507 --> 00:35:59,271
Sanju picks fights in the kitchen

300
00:36:00,178 --> 00:36:03,511
- Your kitchen? Or his?
- The kitchen is the same

301
00:36:04,182 --> 00:36:07,242
In Bombay, you're lucky to find
one kitchen inside one flat

302
00:36:08,486 --> 00:36:11,319
I don't understand...
You and Sanju...

303
00:36:14,158 --> 00:36:18,492
Sanju never told you? We live together,
in the same apartment

304
00:36:23,134 --> 00:36:23,964
How many bedrooms?

305
00:36:25,536 --> 00:36:29,165
You and Ria, live together?
In the same flat?

306
00:36:29,374 --> 00:36:32,434
No, how could she live
in my flat? Never... no

307
00:36:33,177 --> 00:36:37,841
- Why are you laughing?
- Nothing. Ria was just telling me...

308
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:43,278
how Sanjay broke down a bathroom
door to rescue her

309
00:36:44,222 --> 00:36:48,022
- And she was clad only in a towel
- You said she never lived with you

310
00:36:48,226 --> 00:36:52,754
She didn't. But of late she doesn't
have a place to live. So...

311
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:00,463
How magnanimous of you Sanjay,
to have given her shelter

312
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:04,035
Very soon, she'll make family
with you. All the best

313
00:37:09,147 --> 00:37:14,585
The plan was nice.
Girl, jealousy... it always works

314
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,117
Maybe the living-together bit
was a bit too much?

315
00:37:20,758 --> 00:37:22,487
They'll make sure
you're married

316
00:37:24,896 --> 00:37:28,263
The likes of Anjali are best
for doctors like me

317
00:37:29,033 --> 00:37:30,728
It's a Ria you need

318
00:37:35,306 --> 00:37:36,637
Coming... aunt

319
00:37:37,942 --> 00:37:40,877
We're finalising a wedding date
for you and Ria

320
00:37:47,051 --> 00:37:47,745
Finalising

321
00:37:50,321 --> 00:37:53,654
It's not working
Got to think up something else

322
00:37:59,397 --> 00:38:00,091
Sanju, come out.

323
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,931
Tell your Ria to come out

324
00:38:04,635 --> 00:38:07,399
Poor Bunty has been knocking
for the past half an hour

325
00:38:07,739 --> 00:38:09,206
And the lady is taking her time
dressing to go out

326
00:38:10,007 --> 00:38:14,137
- All dressed and raring to go? Where?
- Anju, the college re-union

327
00:38:15,113 --> 00:38:19,049
The annual do, the old students
get together... never got the card?

328
00:38:20,651 --> 00:38:25,452
I got invited before you. I've been
invited regularly these last 3 years

329
00:38:26,357 --> 00:38:28,587
- I never went, not even once
- So sad

330
00:38:30,428 --> 00:38:31,986
- You'll miss it this year too
- How come?

331
00:38:32,964 --> 00:38:36,365
How can you go?
You're getting married in 3 days

332
00:38:36,768 --> 00:38:41,364
But how can you go? I skipped the last 3
years because you weren't here

333
00:38:41,739 --> 00:38:46,540
We promised each other, we wouldn't
go to the re-unions without each other

334
00:38:47,078 --> 00:38:52,675
- Oh I forgot, sorry
- No problem. Change

335
00:38:53,151 --> 00:38:54,482
Let's go downstairs
for a game of carrom

336
00:38:55,253 --> 00:38:56,845
- I can't.
- Why?

337
00:38:57,355 --> 00:39:00,654
Darling, I'm ready.
Let's go

338
00:39:04,762 --> 00:39:10,462
I promised Ria. She wants to see
my college. I can't break her heart

339
00:39:11,035 --> 00:39:11,797
Shall we... darling?

340
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,773
If you want come along
I'm sure Ria won't mind

341
00:39:20,344 --> 00:39:24,974
My invitation says, I can bring along
a guest of my choice

342
00:39:25,183 --> 00:39:29,677
- Then, you're coming?
- Of course. With a guy of my choice

343
00:40:15,366 --> 00:40:18,267
"There's no one like us"

344
00:40:18,469 --> 00:40:22,235
"We're the life of the party"

345
00:40:29,647 --> 00:40:37,577
"Is there anyone else
...like us?"

346
00:41:18,429 --> 00:41:25,801
"Why lament that you can't find
anyone else?"

347
00:41:29,607 --> 00:41:36,308
"Is there no one else?
Well, I don't lament that"

348
00:41:36,914 --> 00:41:40,315
"We're young, we're beautiful"

349
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:43,644
"We have no laments"

350
00:41:43,854 --> 00:41:47,813
"The sights are already
driving me crazy

351
00:42:02,606 --> 00:42:05,507
"Is anyone else around like us?"

352
00:42:05,776 --> 00:42:09,007
I'm the life of the party"

353
00:42:47,218 --> 00:42:53,885
"When you're with me
everything is beautiful"

354
00:43:05,803 --> 00:43:12,402
"The road ahead is full of love"

355
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:16,569
"Come into my heart
let my search end"

356
00:43:42,273 --> 00:43:47,438
"Anyone else around
like you and I...?"

357
00:43:49,346 --> 00:43:56,115
"You and I have brought to life...
this party"

358
00:43:56,787 --> 00:44:04,455
"Anything like you-and-I...?"

359
00:44:47,271 --> 00:44:49,933
What a pair! That's how
a friendship ought to be

360
00:44:51,909 --> 00:44:53,376
Wish I too had a friendship
like this

361
00:44:54,545 --> 00:44:57,776
- Are you talking about Sanjay or Anjali?
- I'm talking about you

362
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:02,441
Sanjay is lucky to have you on his side.

363
00:45:02,853 --> 00:45:04,411
That's what everyone says in Bombay

364
00:45:04,755 --> 00:45:07,952
Only lucky guys get friends
I mean girl friends like Ria

365
00:45:09,293 --> 00:45:14,526
- Hey what happened?
- Ria, will you spare me this act?

366
00:45:15,399 --> 00:45:21,269
- Act? How can you call it an act?
- You're his friend. Not girlfriend

367
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:28,076
But you make a great friend. That's why
I wish I had a friend like you

368
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:32,715
Someone who would be willing
to help me to get Anjali

369
00:45:34,285 --> 00:45:36,446
Between friends, you got to do
what it takes for friendship's sake

370
00:45:37,087 --> 00:45:39,351
- From "Maine Pyar Kiya?"
- You watched the movie?

371
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:41,885
- Six times.
- I could be your friend

372
00:45:42,493 --> 00:45:43,221
Off the record

373
00:45:44,762 --> 00:45:46,252
Can I ask you something
off the record?

374
00:45:47,932 --> 00:45:51,766
What makes you so confident that
whatever you're doing is right?

375
00:45:53,837 --> 00:45:54,929
See them together?

376
00:45:57,474 --> 00:46:01,240
- Sanju, I want that trophy
- You've taken three of five

377
00:46:01,445 --> 00:46:02,503
- This is my turn.
- Sanju, please...

378
00:46:02,713 --> 00:46:04,237
No, score is score

379
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:10,885
- Aren't they made for each other?
- Certainly not

380
00:46:14,158 --> 00:46:16,353
Life's no dance competition, Ria
Nice dancing partners...

381
00:46:17,394 --> 00:46:21,490
don't necessarily
make good life partners

382
00:46:23,467 --> 00:46:27,335
The bigger decisions in life
can't be based on trivia

383
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:35,876
Say, if you never knew Sanjay
say, if you were my friend...

384
00:46:37,114 --> 00:46:42,279
suppose I was the one who invited you
And now, look at them

385
00:46:57,635 --> 00:47:03,631
Do you still say that Sanjay and
Anjali were made for each other?

386
00:47:06,043 --> 00:47:08,307
Whatever you or I think
doesn't make a difference

387
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:13,978
What makes all the difference
is what Anjali wants

388
00:47:20,457 --> 00:47:21,481
What Anjali wants

389
00:47:27,631 --> 00:47:32,933
- You're a nice guy, Rohit
- I know

390
00:47:34,271 --> 00:47:38,230
But sometimes, I'm afraid my ethics
might create obstacles

391
00:47:51,055 --> 00:47:51,680
Gayatri...

392
00:47:57,528 --> 00:47:59,428
girls all over the world
are getting married

393
00:48:00,898 --> 00:48:03,093
But no mother-of-the-bride was ever
as harried as you are

394
00:48:04,735 --> 00:48:05,963
What will people say?

395
00:48:07,404 --> 00:48:08,701
- Ajit...
- Yes?

396
00:48:08,906 --> 00:48:11,932
- Send the sweets to Rohit's house
- Yes uncle

397
00:48:15,245 --> 00:48:19,978
Our son-in-law is one-in-a-million
It's a time to rejoice. And you...

398
00:48:22,419 --> 00:48:22,908
What's going on?

399
00:48:28,225 --> 00:48:30,159
Sanju, will you make Gayatri
see some reason?

400
00:48:31,261 --> 00:48:34,958
She insists that a twitch
in her left eye bodes ill

401
00:48:37,968 --> 00:48:39,799
Is Aunt's superstition
rubbing off on you

402
00:48:41,739 --> 00:48:45,266
If you ever have a daughter
and come the time for her wedding...

403
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:48,508
- ...you'll know.
- What...?

404
00:48:51,281 --> 00:48:54,910
Isn't it sad to know that my daughter
will be leaving me in a couple of days?

405
00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:00,784
I got a wonderful idea!
Let me marry Anju

406
00:49:01,458 --> 00:49:04,825
And I'll move in to live with you
Then Anjali won't have to go away

407
00:49:06,597 --> 00:49:11,193
If that could've happened
no one would be happier than I

408
00:49:11,902 --> 00:49:17,135
You'd be happy to give your daughter
away to a fool like him?

409
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:23,646
Your daughter has chosen someone nice
like Rohit. Thank God for that

410
00:49:24,381 --> 00:49:25,609
And everything's working out fine

411
00:49:26,884 --> 00:49:30,376
Most parents lose their sleep
over a daughter's wedding

412
00:49:31,255 --> 00:49:34,122
And before we knew it
this match was finalised

413
00:49:34,324 --> 00:49:41,628
- Before we knew it... just think
- What's there to worry about?

414
00:49:42,433 --> 00:49:46,267
In front of so many people
it takes only one wrong word...

415
00:49:48,572 --> 00:49:55,569
to hurt everyone. And it has
happened so many times

416
00:49:57,147 --> 00:49:59,445
And I've heard,
seen such instances...

417
00:50:01,118 --> 00:50:05,680
where one misplaced word can destroy
relationships that have lasted years

418
00:50:08,058 --> 00:50:15,328
Are we about to forge new relationships
at the cost of old ones?

419
00:50:17,367 --> 00:50:18,334
It deserves a thought

420
00:50:29,012 --> 00:50:36,441
You're getting worried for nothing
I'm around, and you have my promise

421
00:50:37,888 --> 00:50:41,517
No one will be hurt
no one will be sad

422
00:50:42,059 --> 00:50:48,931
I'll make sure everyone is happy
I'm your magic man, am I not?

423
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:06,875
Listen...

424
00:51:11,255 --> 00:51:21,859
- About Sanju marrying Anjali...
- Gayatri, you know what he's like

425
00:51:22,533 --> 00:51:27,095
- He was joking. He wasn't serious
- What if he was?

426
00:51:29,506 --> 00:51:32,805
- Uncle...
- Coming

427
00:51:35,279 --> 00:51:38,248
Sanju is always joking

428
00:51:55,832 --> 00:51:58,426
Sanjay, guess what Rohit told Anjali
over the phone? He said...

429
00:51:58,936 --> 00:52:03,464
- ...you should hear it yourself
- You taped their conversation?

430
00:52:03,774 --> 00:52:06,868
- Of course
- You're too much

431
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:09,601
- Should I not have done it?
- Of course not

432
00:52:11,515 --> 00:52:17,215
Anjali and Rohit are getting married
What right have you...?

433
00:52:19,022 --> 00:52:22,389
I'm not here to attend some Anjali's
wedding to one Rohit

434
00:52:23,193 --> 00:52:25,127
I'm here to break up the wedding

435
00:52:38,475 --> 00:52:42,309
You got to tell Anjali that
you're in love with her

436
00:52:44,314 --> 00:52:49,308
Sanjay, will you tell Anjali
or won't you?

437
00:52:54,992 --> 00:52:59,725
- Why not?
- I don't know...

438
00:53:00,797 --> 00:53:05,359
- Then I'll tell her...
- No Ria... please

439
00:53:16,947 --> 00:53:19,472
I don't think you need me here.

440
00:53:22,886 --> 00:53:28,847
Then... I think I'll just leave

441
00:53:36,433 --> 00:53:37,229
Won't you stop me?

442
00:53:48,578 --> 00:53:53,447
- I don't know what to say...
- You needn't tell me anything

443
00:53:55,519 --> 00:53:59,319
But you won't ever tell the one
you ought to be telling, will you?

444
00:54:06,029 --> 00:54:10,932
Sanjay, my best compliments
It's your best friend's wedding

445
00:54:13,437 --> 00:54:20,240
See you in Bombay. In the meantime
if you achieve anything, invite me

446
00:54:22,145 --> 00:54:23,476
To your wedding

447
00:54:49,806 --> 00:54:53,071
Uncle, this is splendid!

448
00:54:54,711 --> 00:54:57,077
I did nothing. Sanjay did all this

449
00:54:58,281 --> 00:55:01,045
He was up all night.
I don't think he has slept

450
00:55:03,019 --> 00:55:05,613
Just like you kept awake
all through my wedding to Nilu

451
00:55:08,792 --> 00:55:10,623
Yes, just like that

452
00:55:14,397 --> 00:55:14,863
You like the design?

453
00:55:15,832 --> 00:55:22,237
Eat this, Nilu, Gita... the bride's
trousseau is here

454
00:55:22,606 --> 00:55:25,404
- Where?
- Downstairs

455
00:55:25,609 --> 00:55:27,702
- Come on, leave that for later
- Okay, come on

456
00:55:47,364 --> 00:55:49,332
You don't want to see
the bride's trousseau

457
00:56:06,883 --> 00:56:14,415
I wanted to see you in bridal finery
But that isn't to be

458
00:56:16,092 --> 00:56:21,155
Why are you leaving so suddenly?
Can't you stay for two days...

459
00:56:22,566 --> 00:56:28,630
I got important work. I'm helpless.
If I could stay back, I would

460
00:56:30,407 --> 00:56:39,179
I wanted to stay for your wedding.
But anyway... Sanjay is here

461
00:56:40,817 --> 00:56:44,617
Aren't you afraid to leave your
boyfriend to a bevy of beauties?

462
00:56:46,456 --> 00:56:51,189
Sanjay isn't my boyfriend.
We're friends. Just friends

463
00:56:54,197 --> 00:57:01,365
- Then why all this...?
- Life plays such jokes with us

464
00:57:02,072 --> 00:57:06,475
And we crack jokes with each other
...only so much to the relationship

465
00:57:08,211 --> 00:57:13,706
In Bombay, Sanjay never fell in love
with any girl, nor can he ever

466
00:57:14,951 --> 00:57:15,576
Why...?

467
00:57:18,555 --> 00:57:23,219
Because the girl in his heart
isn't in Bombay

468
00:57:25,128 --> 00:57:27,028
Aunt, your cab is here

469
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:40,098
- Not in Bombay? Where else?
- How can I say?

470
00:57:41,111 --> 00:57:46,743
You are his best friend. You ought
to know what is in his heart

471
00:57:48,952 --> 00:57:52,683
Seek within your heart,
you might find the answer

472
00:58:18,748 --> 00:58:21,308
Yes Sanjay, tell me

473
00:58:23,887 --> 00:58:24,649
I'm going

474
00:58:26,356 --> 00:58:26,822
Back

475
00:58:29,859 --> 00:58:30,723
You win

476
00:58:32,329 --> 00:58:32,920
I lose

477
00:58:35,432 --> 00:58:37,593
I don't know why I believed
why Anjali and I...

478
00:58:40,904 --> 00:58:41,666
Without even thinking

479
00:58:42,405 --> 00:58:44,873
how one mistake of mine...
might break so many hearts

480
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:50,479
Thanks to you, I stopped myself
from making that mistake

481
00:58:52,582 --> 00:58:57,815
Anyone else in your place...
but how could you be someone else?

482
00:58:59,556 --> 00:59:03,219
You are Rohit, the perfect one

483
00:59:04,894 --> 00:59:06,225
The one for Anjali

484
00:59:10,266 --> 00:59:14,532
I was Anjali's friend.
I'll stay a friend

485
00:59:17,107 --> 00:59:18,540
But I won't be able to stay

486
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:25,673
I don't have the courage to see Anjali
leaving with someone else

487
00:59:28,251 --> 00:59:31,220
Nor am I gentleman enough
to let you carry her away

488
00:59:35,458 --> 00:59:36,652
Take care of Anju

489
00:59:49,172 --> 00:59:53,370
The wedding is tomorrow. I won't
ask you to stay for the wedding

490
00:59:56,112 --> 00:59:59,980
But today, won't you join in
my celebrations?

491
01:00:05,355 --> 01:00:07,482
We just became friends, didn't we?

492
01:00:09,292 --> 01:00:12,284
Yes, we just became friends

493
01:00:16,933 --> 01:00:19,993
And I'll make sure everyone
joins the celebration

494
01:00:21,704 --> 01:00:24,434
After all, it's my friend's wedding

495
01:00:56,673 --> 01:01:01,303
"To the rhythm of drums,
her anklets chime"

496
01:01:11,187 --> 01:01:15,146
"The bride wears a veil
the bridegroom carries flowers"

497
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:19,886
"And the Spring follows them
around the world"

498
01:01:20,163 --> 01:01:22,188
"May all the happiness
in the world be theirs"

499
01:01:22,398 --> 01:01:29,497
"Here's a prayer from my heart
for my friend's wedding"

500
01:02:44,214 --> 01:02:48,742
"My friend has found love"

501
01:02:49,385 --> 01:02:53,913
"For him, this is sweet victory"

502
01:03:08,638 --> 01:03:10,765
"I'm so happy..."

503
01:03:10,974 --> 01:03:15,434
"I'm so happy, I've filled this party..."

504
01:03:15,645 --> 01:03:17,374
"with songs..."

505
01:03:17,914 --> 01:03:27,118
"for a dear friend's wedding"

506
01:04:04,761 --> 01:04:06,991
"There's no winning,
there can be no losing..."

507
01:04:07,463 --> 01:04:09,488
"where there's love"

508
01:04:09,999 --> 01:04:14,493
"If there be a contest,
there can be no love"

509
01:04:29,252 --> 01:04:31,311
"Let's embrace..."

510
01:04:31,721 --> 01:04:33,518
"friend..."

511
01:04:36,292 --> 01:04:37,953
"here's a prayer from my heart..."

512
01:04:38,394 --> 01:04:47,860
"for my friend's wedding"

513
01:05:11,627 --> 01:05:16,587
"My childhood friends,
my childhood playground..."

514
01:05:16,933 --> 01:05:21,666
"my toys, my swings,
I will miss everyone"

515
01:05:22,171 --> 01:05:26,471
"How will I hide my tears?"

516
01:06:03,146 --> 01:06:08,140
"My friend, hear what our
playground tells..."

517
01:06:08,384 --> 01:06:13,447
"colour your heart,
you life in hues of love..."

518
01:06:13,890 --> 01:06:18,452
"and even the jewellery
you wear will smile"

519
01:06:18,661 --> 01:06:23,291
"Remember that, friend"

520
01:06:33,709 --> 01:06:38,146
"My friend's wedding..."

521
01:06:38,514 --> 01:06:42,974
"it's my friend's wedding"

522
01:07:04,707 --> 01:07:07,505
So you're leaving? You lost

523
01:07:10,012 --> 01:07:14,005
It's you who told me to put
my heart into the game

524
01:07:15,551 --> 01:07:17,018
Win or lose, what difference?

525
01:07:19,322 --> 01:07:20,186
Sanju are you sure?

526
01:07:22,558 --> 01:07:32,695
- Are you doing the right thing?
- Yes Uncle, just as sure as you were

527
01:07:53,022 --> 01:07:54,819
Hindustani women are incomprehensible

528
01:07:56,225 --> 01:08:00,855
Try to get close and their decorum and
their decency stands in the way

529
01:08:01,764 --> 01:08:09,068
And 12 hours before the wedding,
summons are issued

530
01:08:14,277 --> 01:08:15,744
What's this sudden
show of affection?

531
01:08:19,782 --> 01:08:25,584
Rohit, we've told each other
about everything...

532
01:08:28,457 --> 01:08:29,253
except one thing...

533
01:08:31,794 --> 01:08:34,922
that you perhaps forgot to ask
...and I forgot to tell you

534
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:37,265
What...?

535
01:08:38,301 --> 01:08:41,099
Whether I ever loved someone
before you

536
01:08:44,307 --> 01:08:46,605
- Did you?
- Yes

537
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:58,614
From the moment such thoughts
about a boy arise in a girl's mind...

538
01:09:01,991 --> 01:09:06,291
- ...there has been such a boy.
- Who is he?

539
01:09:06,996 --> 01:09:11,464
Sanju, my friend
...my best friend

540
01:09:16,172 --> 01:09:21,633
But you saw Sanju. How can I even
expect him to understand?

541
01:09:23,012 --> 01:09:27,972
He's lost in his own world.
I always hoped...

542
01:09:29,185 --> 01:09:31,653
some time or the other,
Sanju would come up and tell me

543
01:09:34,690 --> 01:09:40,651
But as time went by,
I realised I'm wrong

544
01:09:41,864 --> 01:09:47,496
For Sanju, I'm just a friend.
Only friend

545
01:09:48,771 --> 01:09:54,573
So I suppressed my feelings,
lest he found out

546
01:09:55,544 --> 01:09:59,344
Then... you came into my life

547
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:03,177
You made me believe, I can have

548
01:10:04,553 --> 01:10:08,011
a good life with someone else too

549
01:10:09,725 --> 01:10:15,857
But before beginning this life,
I wanted you to know...

550
01:10:18,067 --> 01:10:24,700
I'm building this relationship
on honesty. Yes, Rohit?

551
01:10:28,744 --> 01:10:32,373
That's just why I called you out

552
01:11:15,291 --> 01:11:16,588
Hello Rohit

553
01:11:19,795 --> 01:11:23,253
Beautiful flowers, just like
your daughter

554
01:11:26,302 --> 01:11:29,931
- You haven't gone to bed yet?
- Lost my sleep

555
01:11:32,208 --> 01:11:37,168
- How come you're up so late?
- I made a promise to Anju...

556
01:11:38,547 --> 01:11:40,014
that I'd decorate her wedding
hall myself.

557
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:42,517
I'm doing it up in flowers

558
01:11:43,552 --> 01:11:47,682
May it be flowers, flowers for her
all the way and no thorns

559
01:11:52,495 --> 01:11:54,122
Your prayer is already bearing fruit

560
01:11:59,201 --> 01:12:01,169
If I ask you a question, will you

561
01:12:03,539 --> 01:12:04,335
give me an honest answer?

562
01:12:05,374 --> 01:12:13,179
- Yes, ask me.
- I wasn't your first choice for Anjali

563
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:25,354
- No son, it's nothing like that.
- I know... I know and it's okay

564
01:12:27,563 --> 01:12:30,361
But there's something
even you don't know

565
01:12:33,402 --> 01:12:34,869
I wasn't Anjali's first choice either.

566
01:12:36,238 --> 01:12:38,365
What are you saying, son?

567
01:12:39,909 --> 01:12:45,870
And for you and your daughter
the first choice was the same

568
01:12:49,084 --> 01:12:49,709
Sanjay

569
01:12:55,057 --> 01:13:01,860
In all these years, Anjali could never
tell Sanju how dearly she loves him?

570
01:13:04,633 --> 01:13:08,091
And there's Sanjay. He loves
Anjali so fiercely...

571
01:13:08,404 --> 01:13:10,531
he can't bear to see her marry
someone else

572
01:13:12,908 --> 01:13:23,716
And I am the only man in the world
who's aware of their feelings.

573
01:13:25,921 --> 01:13:29,880
The only man who can give
any twist to this tale

574
01:13:33,262 --> 01:13:33,887
But what am I to do?

575
01:13:35,831 --> 01:13:41,633
What do I do now?

576
01:13:44,573 --> 01:13:49,203
Now I know, Sanjay was right.

577
01:13:51,513 --> 01:14:01,320
This story is his. And Anjali's.
I had no place in this story

578
01:14:06,195 --> 01:14:11,497
Sanjay left. Because he didn't
want to break anyone's heart

579
01:14:13,636 --> 01:14:15,433
At least he knew
what he ought to do

580
01:14:18,807 --> 01:14:20,104
Anjali told me...

581
01:14:21,644 --> 01:14:25,944
because she wanted honesty to be
the cornerstone of our relationship

582
01:14:28,317 --> 01:14:29,784
She knows too
what she ought to do

583
01:14:34,323 --> 01:14:38,453
Now it's my turn. Even I know
what I ought to do

584
01:14:41,497 --> 01:14:45,456
But what I must do, I cannot
bring about all by myself

585
01:14:48,837 --> 01:14:49,963
I need a mother to bless my way...

586
01:14:51,840 --> 01:15:00,475
to tell me, "Son, you're right"

587
01:15:04,019 --> 01:15:04,986
"I am with you"

588
01:15:08,023 --> 01:15:12,323
- Say, are you with me?
- Yes

589
01:15:30,713 --> 01:15:36,515
- Hey... Say, how do I feel?
- How...?

590
01:15:37,553 --> 01:15:40,852
Like I've fast-forwarded
a decade into life

591
01:15:42,224 --> 01:15:46,024
I feel like we're both 35 and here
we are sitting at Gateway of India

592
01:15:47,229 --> 01:15:49,857
You haven't found a boy
and I haven't found a girl

593
01:15:51,734 --> 01:15:52,701
- Really?
- Yes

594
01:15:53,902 --> 01:15:56,530
- So...?
- So let's strike a deal

595
01:15:57,539 --> 01:16:01,669
At thirty-five if we're still here,
then we'll get married

596
01:16:05,914 --> 01:16:08,212
- On one condition.
- What?

597
01:16:09,084 --> 01:16:10,711
You'll still do the cooking

598
01:16:13,255 --> 01:16:14,882
Okay, done

599
01:16:22,431 --> 01:16:24,228
Talking about being 35...

600
01:16:25,901 --> 01:16:27,198
I don't even know...

601
01:16:28,837 --> 01:16:31,397
with Anjali gone, how I'll manage
to live beyond the day after...?

602
01:16:50,325 --> 01:16:54,455
You... here...? Tomorrow's your wedding

603
01:16:54,830 --> 01:16:55,455
Why did you leave?

604
01:16:57,833 --> 01:17:00,631
- Ria fell sick all of a sudden...
- No Ria, no Rohit

605
01:17:03,005 --> 01:17:08,966
No one's an excuse to my question.
You and I...

606
01:17:10,679 --> 01:17:12,146
and between us, this one question

607
01:17:13,682 --> 01:17:17,982
- Why did you leave?
- Because...

608
01:17:19,688 --> 01:17:21,155
- because I...
- Because what?

609
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:27,988
Because I can't bear to see you
marry someone else

610
01:17:29,865 --> 01:17:34,996
- Why can't you bear?
- Because I wanted to marry you

611
01:17:36,538 --> 01:17:40,497
- Then why didn't you tell me?
- I was afraid Anju

612
01:17:42,377 --> 01:17:43,173
If you refused...

613
01:17:46,548 --> 01:17:47,845
It would've broken my heart.

614
01:17:49,051 --> 01:17:52,020
What about all these years...
that I held my heart and I pined?

615
01:17:56,058 --> 01:18:00,518
Did you ever think of the girl
who was with you all her life...

616
01:18:01,563 --> 01:18:04,191
holding hands, sitting with you
on that swing...?

617
01:18:05,734 --> 01:18:11,366
In the whole wide world, why does
she have an only friend?

618
01:18:14,243 --> 01:18:24,710
A girl goes through her childhood
and her youth with one boy

619
01:18:26,588 --> 01:18:30,388
Would she ever seek the company of
someone else... for the rest of her life?

620
01:18:33,262 --> 01:18:34,229
Have you never wondered?

621
01:18:35,931 --> 01:18:39,389
You never thought that all I needed
was only my friend?

622
01:18:42,437 --> 01:18:46,066
The only one. You

623
01:18:50,612 --> 01:18:58,917
How can a girl be expected to be
the first to express her feelings?

624
01:19:03,292 --> 01:19:06,420
You never wondered? Never...?

625
01:19:06,628 --> 01:19:12,260
- I'm... I'm sorry, Anju.
- Sorry? Is that all you can muster?

626
01:19:13,969 --> 01:19:17,097
Won't you say what I've wanted
to hear all these years?

627
01:19:24,146 --> 01:19:24,942
I love you

628
01:20:14,196 --> 01:20:18,496
"To the rhythm of drums,
her anklets chime"

629
01:20:28,710 --> 01:20:32,840
"The bride wears a veil,
the bridegroom carries flowers"

630
01:20:33,048 --> 01:20:37,178
"And the Spring follows them
around the world

631
01:20:37,886 --> 01:20:40,013
"May all the happiness
in the world be theirs"

632
01:20:40,222 --> 01:20:42,520
"Here's a prayer from my heart
for my friend's wedding"

633
01:20:42,891 --> 01:21:11,915
"It's my friend's wedding"
