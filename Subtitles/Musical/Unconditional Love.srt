00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:06,863
<i>Two train tickets</i>

00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:11,199
<i>One round trip</i>

4
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:15,264
<i>I made my bed</i>
<i>where a fella falls</i>

5
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:19,539
<i>But I get the feeling</i>
<i>we're forever more</i>

6
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,315
<i>Well, hello</i>

<i>Don't be late</i>

<i>Don't let me take</i>

<i>Mmm...</i>

<i>Don't you take</i>

<i>Gonna buy me a ticket</i>
<i>at the station</i>

35
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:56,435
<i>- Where you gonna go?</i>
<i>- On a train tonight</i>

36
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:59,740
<i>On a train tonight</i>

37
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:02,610
<i>On a train tonight</i>

00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,957
<i>Please, not standing</i>

<i>I will be by your side</i>

<i>Next to me...</i>

<i>I would steal you</i>

<i>Our love would bloom</i>
<i>'neath a blanket of stars.</i>

<i>His name, of course,</i>
<i>is Victor Fox.</i>

00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:59,520
<i>But legions of fans know him</i>
<i>as ''The Lark from Lark. ''</i>

60
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,397
<i>Champagne in one hand,</i>
<i>a microphone in the other,</i>

61
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,402
<i>his music sells</i>
<i>in the millions.</i>

62
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,839
<i>But if you</i>
<i>let me love you</i>

63
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:12,105
<i>It's for sure</i>
<i>I'm gonna love you...</i>

64
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:16,738
<i>And he's with us today on</i>
<i>''Good Morning Chicago. ''</i>

65
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,306
<i>Welcome to Chicago, Victor.</i>

66
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:21,012
<i>Happy to be here.</i>
<i>Very happy, indeed.</i>

67
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:25,046
<i>Max! Victor Fox</i>
<i>is here in Chicago!</i>

68
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,558
<i>...I played in America</i>
<i>on a concert tour here.</i>

69
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,892
<i>You're here, of course, to do one of your</i>
<i>famous Christmas specials.</i>

70
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:33,955
<i>Will you be choosing someone</i>
<i>from the audience to sing to?</i>

71
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,399
<i>Oh yes, there will be</i>
<i>that special someone.</i>

72
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:40,303
<i>Of course, it's always a wonderful thing</i>
<i>to take a beautiful woman by the hand,</i>

73
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:43,432
<i>look into her eyes</i>
<i>and sing her a love song.</i>

74
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:48,845
<i>- You're darling.</i>
<i>- Victor, oh.</i>

75
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,213
<i>Well, I hope you heard that,</i>
<i>Chicago ladies,</i>

76
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,117
<i>because the next five people that call</i>
<i>this number will win a ticket</i>

77
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,815
<i>to be part of the audience</i>
<i>for Victor's Christmas special.</i>

78
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:59,949
<i>- Call now.</i>
<i>- Yes, please, do call.</i>

79
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,620
<i>And of course,</i>
<i>I would love you all to be there,</i>

80
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,492
<i>but even if you can't,</i>

81
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:07,829
<i>I'll be singing especially...</i>

82
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,492
<i>for you.</i>

83
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,298
Hello, you're one of the five.
Please hold.

84
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,271
Hello, you're one of the five.
Please hold.

85
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,499
Hello, you're one of the five.
Please hold.

86
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:17,576
I got through!

87
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,505
Max, I got through!

88
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,413
We need to talk, Grace.

89
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,817
I better sit down. I don't want to drop
the phone and lose the connection.

90
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,847
Are you okay?
You look kind of pale.

91
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,154
I'm not sick.
We have to talk, Grace.

92
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,092
But I'm just on hold
for these tickets.

93
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,221
There's only five
and I'm one.

94
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,162
It's Victor Fox.
It's for the Special.

95
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,396
For his taping here in Chicago.
It's ''The Lark from Lark''!

96
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:45,960
We need to discuss
our marriage.

97
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:52,334
Our
Our marriage?

98
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,650
Is it
Is it terrible?

99
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:01,551
Should I
Should I be afraid?

100
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:07,048
I ... I don't want
to be married anymore.

101
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,959
Hello, thanks for waiting.
Congratulations.

102
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,656
Can I take your name
and address?

103
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,529
You don't want
to be married anymore?

104
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:21,140
You don't want
to be married to me...

105
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,868
...or you don't want
to be married?

106
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,342
Hello?

107
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:28,744
I found
an apartment downtown.

108
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:31,340
The name and address
are here on this memo.

109
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:34,648
I've also included my attorney's
name and number.

110
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,450
You should call him so that he can
explain my payments to you.

111
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:40,856
I put down the name
of a very good counselor.

112
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:44,328
You should call her.
She's expecting you to call.

113
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,456
I've been seeing her
myself for the past year.

114
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,659
She's been very helpful.

115
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:50,964
You've been
You've been seeing a counselor?

116
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:55,098
We should Shouldn't we have been
doing that together?

117
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,177
- No.
- To discuss our problems?

118
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,871
You were the problem.

119
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,444
I'm
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:08,510
I didn't
I didn't mean that.

121
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,284
I didn't mean
to say that.

122
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:16,061
How was I
the problem?

123
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,592
Max how was I
the problem?

124
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,731
Mortality.

125
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,376
One day,
I'm gonna die.

126
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:40,777
This morning I saw a window-washer
on the other building here.

127
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,913
He has one of the most
dangerous jobs imaginable...

128
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:49,758
and yet, what a view.
I'm not young anymore.

129
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:53,162
I have to start small
with the dangerous things.

130
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,564
I have to leave you, Grace.

131
00:08:55,635 --> 00:09:00,072
And I know I will feel terrible
when I walk out that door,

132
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:03,631
but I also know I will feel
more alive than I do right now.

133
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,238
I never said that.

134
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,850
Am I late?
I'm sorry if I am.

135
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,452
I had to drop
Pokey off at day care.

136
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,589
Yes, day care!
I needed the rest.

137
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,759
He cries all night.
I am sleep-deprived,

138
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:30,768
- and it's your fault.
- My fault?

139
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,430
You rocked Andrew to sleep every night
when he was a baby.

140
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,871
He rocked Pokey
to sleep every night.

141
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:39,309
He left us and I can't rock Pokey
the same way he did.

142
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:43,144
Bastard!
He was making Pokey rely on him.

143
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:46,309
Why did you let us get married?
We weren't compatible.

144
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:49,115
Andrew always told me
you were very compatible.

145
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,177
Sexually, that's it.

146
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:52,553
As soon as the baby came into it,
we were finished.

147
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,685
It's this generation of men.
They think they never have to grow up.

148
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,457
Excuse
They never see me.

149
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,159
They never
stop seeing me.

150
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:05,101
Over here!
Hey!

151
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:09,073
Now Max, his generation accepted
what it meant to be grown up.

152
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:12,133
How long have you two
been married?

153
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,746
25 years.

154
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:18,112
And you still
love each other.

155
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,518
Whatever.
Passion isn't everything. I prove that.

156
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:26,922
The chicken salad,
dressing on the side and a latte.

157
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:31,157
- Me too.
- You too, what?

158
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,698
Please?

159
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,667
''Me too'' what? What does that mean?
The latte? The salad?

160
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:39,034
Excuse me.

161
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,198
Hey!
Look at me!

162
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,368
Is this rudeness deliberate
or are you just lacking social skills?

163
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,038
- I beg your pardon?
- ''I beg your pardon?''

164
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:51,277
Now she's ''Miss Manners.''
Are you picking on my mother-in-law.

165
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,318
Because she's a housewife
who reminds you

166
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,684
of your own mother,
who you probably despise?

167
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:59,657
Or is it that my being a dwarf
makes you so uncomfortable,

168
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:02,455
but you know you'll be fired
if you aren't polite to a dwarf?

169
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,730
I'll be right back
with your order.

170
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:13,999
Why don't you take a picture?
It lasts longer.

171
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:20,508
You're right.

172
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,774
It's all my fault.

173
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:26,340
Andrew left you because he was afraid
of being a father.

174
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,119
He was always
a fearful little boy.

175
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,522
I'd say to him,
''It's all right, darling.

176
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,560
There's nothing
to be afraid of.''

177
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:38,461
But he never believed me.

178
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,056
Because I didn't believe me.

179
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:44,102
But there's so much
to be afraid of.

180
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,697
There's war and murder.
Diseases...

181
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:51,937
pollution and loneliness...
And Max left me

182
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,740
Most of those things
aren't your fault.

183
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,509
What?

184
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:59,813
Did you just say
Max left you?

185
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,550
Why?

186
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,360
You piece of shit!

187
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,669
<i>This is my best friend</i>

188
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:26,142
<i>who left her underwear next to the bed</i>
<i>so my kids could find it.</i>

189
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,110
<i>These are what he got!</i>

190
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:40,149
<i>Wise men say</i>

191
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:46,358
<i>Only fools rush in</i>

192
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:53,734
<i>But I can't help</i>

193
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,105
<i>Falling in love</i>

194
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:01,146
<i>With... you</i>

195
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,547
<i>Like a river flows</i>

196
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:09,110
<i>- Like a river flows...</i>
<i>- Surely to the sea...</i>

197
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,746
<i>It flows straight into the sea...</i>

198
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:14,589
<i>- Darling, so it goes...</i>
<i>- Don't be afraid...</i>

199
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:20,462
<i>Some things</i>
<i>are meant to be</i>

200
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,733
<i>Take my hand</i>

201
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,042
<i>Take my whole life, too</i>

202
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:41,215
<i>For I can't help</i>

203
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:45,587
<i>Falling in love</i>

204
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,320
<i>With</i>

205
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,852
<i>You</i>

206
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:59,298
<i>Falling in</i>

207
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,902
<i>He's a very good actor,</i>
<i>and he's a wonderful writer.</i>

208
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,443
<i>Do you think</i>
<i>he has a shot?</i>

209
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,037
<i>Anybody who thinks</i>

210
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:12,447
<i>George McGovern,</i>
<i>Mondale</i>

211
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,578
<i>not exactly</i>
<i>president material.</i>

212
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,569
He said he needed
to do ''dangerous things''

213
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,607
To feel alive again.

214
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,644
Maybe it's the same
for me, too.

215
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,545
Maybe... Maybe I need to do
something dangerous.

216
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:46,711
I mean, if you knew me,
you'd be quite surprised

217
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:50,482
that I'm calling you like this.
I mean, if you knew me

218
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:56,422
If you knew me...

219
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:03,095
you'd know that this is
a very dangerous thing for me to do.

220
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,602
Because you could say no...

221
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:10,699
or you could humiliate
me in some way.

222
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,004
But at least I've had
the courage to call.

223
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:16,947
lsn't there
one more ticket?

224
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,142
Well you see,
you hung up.

225
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,686
That disqualified you.
I'm sorry.

226
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:25,588
Please. You don't know how important
it is for me to see Victor Fox.

227
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,923
See, that ticket
was more than a ticket to me.

228
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:33,556
It was a tiny,
shining piece of hope.

229
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,531
Listen, I can't
promise you anything

230
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,473
but...

231
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:48,012
Here, give me your name
and address just in case.

232
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:51,742
Uh...
Grace...

233
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,375
Beasley.

234
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,615
404 East Wacker Drive,

235
00:15:56,689 --> 00:16:01,126
Apartment 2809,
Chicago.

236
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:05,260
Okay, Grace.

237
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,098
I have to hang up now.

238
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,136
Okay.

239
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:18,608
Oh!

240
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,711
- Hello?
- Mrs. Beasley?

241
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,713
- Yes.
- This is Nurse Mills.

242
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,749
Please hold for your
daughter-in-law.

243
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,512
- Grace?
- Maudey, what's wrong?

244
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,177
I'm in the hospital.

245
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:31,188
I had a panic attack while I was dropping
Pokey at day care.

246
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,156
Not a heart attack,
a panic attack.

247
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,056
I just thought
it was a heart attack.

248
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,459
They said I have to learn
to deal with my stress.

249
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,623
To learn to deal with the fact that
relationships don't last.

250
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,327
l

251
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,469
Maudey, where's Pokey?

252
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,178
- Morning, Mrs. Beasley.
- Morning, Keith.

253
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,975
- Business or pleasure?
- Pardon me?

254
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,073
Today's exciting adventure.

255
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,845
I'm going to pick up
my grandson.

256
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:03,354
Great. Oh, Mrs. Beasley.
You've heard the warning?

257
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:04,980
What warning?

258
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,753
It's more advice really.
Just don't get out of your car.

259
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,384
What? When?

260
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,258
You know, when you're
underneath the city.

261
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,231
Especially don't stop
and talk to the homeless.

262
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:15,459
Why? What have they
been doing?

263
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,900
I don't want
to worry you, okay?

264
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,905
But keep your windows
rolled up, all right?

265
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,908
All right?

266
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,681
Sad Victor?

267
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,382
Oh no. Not now.
You're here, Pokey.

268
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,051
Romantic Victor?
When you're older.

269
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,856
''Victor Sings Dusty!''

270
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:47,262
<i>I don't know what it is</i>
<i>that makes me love you so</i>

271
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:50,563
<i>I only know I never</i>
<i>want to let you go</i>

272
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:54,333
<i>You've started something,</i>
<i>oh, can't you see</i>

273
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,932
<i>That ever since we met</i>
<i>you've had a hold on me?</i>

274
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,341
<i>It happens to be true</i>

275
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:05,179
<i>What's true?</i>
<i>I only want to be with you</i>

276
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,276
<i>It doesn't matter</i>
<i>where you go or what you do</i>

277
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:11,948
<i>I want to spend each moment</i>
<i>of the day with you</i>

278
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:15,755
<i>But look what has happened</i>
<i>with just one kiss</i>

279
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:19,320
<i>I never knew that I could be</i>
<i>in love like this...</i>

280
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,498
Oh!

281
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,165
It's okay.
It's okay.

282
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,674
It's just fireworks.

283
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:36,271
Oh, isn't it beautiful?
It's a sign, Pokey.

284
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:40,648
They'll find an extra ticket,
and Victor will sing to me,

285
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:43,415
and Max will see me
on television

286
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,923
and he'll
come back to me.

287
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,289
Then your mama
will feel better

288
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,885
and she'll
come back to you.

289
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:54,296
We will all be healed.

290
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:57,358
It's a sign.

291
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,292
Andrew!

292
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,989
Sorry, ma.
I didn't want to wake you.

293
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:28,965
I just left you a note to tell you
that I picked up Pokey.

294
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:32,362
Where are you going
to take him at this hour?

295
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:35,406
His day care center
opens at 5:00.

296
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,067
Please, darling,
leave Pokey with me.

297
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,169
Just until Maudey feels
better able to cope.

298
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,113
It's not a good idea
right now.

299
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,674
I'm his grandmother.

300
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,656
I just don't want
anything bad

301
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:54,123
to happen to him.

302
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,424
And it's
it's safe at day care.

303
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,964
Well yes, but...

304
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,728

than being safe.

Who is it?

318
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,914
It's Keith, Mrs. Beasley.
I've got a delivery for you.

00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:40,129
Oh thank you!

320
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:49,106
Yes!

321
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:54,136
They're placing the stool.

322
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,804
The champagne.

323
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,644
Dom Perignon '67.

324
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,445
Or Cristal '92.

find the Dom.

326

Moet in Guam.

327
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,447
Well Guam.

''Victor dreams''?

Er...

332
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,574
She does.

333
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:29,069
Yes we can.
The union doesn't care...

334
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:36,819
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention please?

beyond our control,

We do plan to tape
the show at a later date.

343
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:17,288
<i>Fans the world over</i>
<i>are in shock and mourning</i>

344
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:19,421
<i>at the discovery</i>
<i>of his body this afternoon</i>

345
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:22,524
<i>in the Lakeside underpass.</i>
<i>Repeating the news,</i>

346
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:26,401
<i>Victor Fox was found murdered</i>
<i>this afternoon in Chicago.</i>

347
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:30,066
<i>Allegedly the victim of the serial killer</i>
<i>known as the ''Crossbow Killer. ''</i>

348
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,642
<i>More details at 6:00.</i>

349
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:48,449
I need some help here.
Ma'am?

350
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,358
I hope we crash and die.

351
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,267
Grace, don't say
things like that to me.

352
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:01,737
I'm supposed to think happy thoughts.
I'm a good mom.

353
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,138
I'm a good mom.
I'm a good mom.

354
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:07,178
- What am I gonna do without him?
- You'll survive.

355
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,248
Sure you lived with him for 25 years,
but you'll survive.

356
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:13,044
- Lived with who?
- Max.

357
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:17,316
Not Max.
Victor Fox.

358
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:20,722
He was murdered
by the Crossbow Killer.

359
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,817
You're kidding me.

360
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:24,987
What are you, crazy?

361
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,834
Wow, what a turnout.

362
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,738
Come on, let's go.
Move!

363
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,243
- All right, all right.
- Keep moving. Let's go.

364
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:48,083
Look at these idiots.

365
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,883
Move!

366
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,488
Let's check out
the flowers and stuff.

367
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:04,126
Pay homage.

368
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:07,865
Come on, Grace.
The keyword here is ''closure.''

369
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:11,408
Excuse me.
Get out of my way.

370
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,978
Move.

371
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,274
Coming through.

372
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,408
- I'm sorry.
- Out of my way. Handicapped.

373
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,633
Grace!

374
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,831
Grace?

375
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,773
Oh my God.
Let's get you a drink.

376
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:48,609
Watch your step.
There's a bar.

377
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:53,546
Come on, move.
Let's go.

378
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:58,621
And now for an update
on the Victor Fox story...

379
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,885
Calm down.

380
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:03,826
Take deep breaths.

381
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,954
What a shithole.

382
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:09,364
...we go live to the underground
where Kate Cummings is on the scene.

383
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:11,493
- What can you tell us?
- Thanks, Kelly...

384
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,868
Why are there
flowers here, too?

385
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:16,805
Victor was here minutes
before he was murdered.

386
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,537
I served him myself.

387
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:21,805
Which table
was he seated at?

388
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,711
Oh, he was

389
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:25,875
He was right here at the bar.

390
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:27,976
Dressed in a glittering suit.

391
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:29,884
What was he drinking?

392
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,946
Guinness.

393
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:35,356
Then I want to sit here at the bar
where he sat

394
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,657
and drink what he drank.

395
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,196
Me too.

396
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,323
It's premature to say
anything at this point.

397
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,060
This is the mug
he drank from.

398
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:45,932
A crossbow?

399
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:48,370
Sell it to you for $1 5.

400
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,134
Come on, 1 5 bucks?

401
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:52,038
He's probably sold
a hundred of them already.

402
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,600
I want it.

403
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:55,680
Victor Fox met the arrow
of a madman.

404
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,213
He was a real nice guy.

405
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:59,783
But he said the beer
in England tastes better.

406
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:01,910
Something about preservatives.

407
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:04,353
Then he said, ''A life lived in fear
isn't much fun.''

408
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:08,058
What did you say?

409
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:11,254
He said, ''A life lived
in fear isn't much fun.''

410
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:13,725
Then he left.

411
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:18,462
<i>This ends our live coverage</i>
<i>of the Victor Fox murder...</i>

412
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:20,470
Let that set a minute.

413
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:23,200
<i>...the man we knew</i>
<i>as ''The Lark from Lark. ''</i>

414
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,106
<i>...Keep on turning</i>

415
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:33,013
<i>Let's just be glad</i>
<i>we had some time</i>

416
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:36,076
<i>To spend together</i>

417
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:43,325
<i>There's no need</i>
<i>to watch the bridges</i>

418
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:46,091
<i>That we're burning</i>

419
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:50,528
<i>Lay your head...</i>

420
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:58,008
<i>Upon my pillow...</i>

421
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,101
People won't
say it out loud,

422
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:03,374
but we'll all be blamed.

423
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:06,906
Chicago will be the city
that killed Victor Fox.

424
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,915
How can any of us
ever be the same?

425
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:14,117
<i>... The raindrops</i>

426
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:18,026
<i>Blowing soft</i>
<i>against the window</i>

427
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:23,623
<i>And make believe</i>
<i>you love me</i>

428
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,034
<i>One more time</i>

429
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,368
<i>For the good times.</i>

430
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,650
I'm going to his funeral.

431
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,620
It'll be in England.

432
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,315
Well, then I'm going
to England.

433
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,790
Why?

434
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:49,417
What did you call it?

435
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,826
''Closure.''

436
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,330
Can't you close here?
You've got the mug.

437
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,264
The funeral won't be
for a few days.

438
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:58,529
I'll leave tonight.

439
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:00,161
What do you mean
you'll leave tonight?

440
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,967
Grace!
Grace!

441
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,064
Hey, Grace!

442
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:05,938
You are not going
to England.

443
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,944
You've been through
a trauma.

444
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,775
Two traumas.

445
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:11,679
Here, breathe
into my bag.

446
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:21,290
Wise men say

447
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:27,059
Only fools rush in

448
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:30,329
But I

449
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,301
I'm sorry.

450
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,928
I sing when
I'm nervous.

451
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:38,031
That's all right.
You have a lovely voice.

452
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:40,668
Oh, thank you.

453
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,805
When I was a girl
I dreamed of becoming a singer.

454
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:46,077
lsn't that silly?

455
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:49,552
Not at all.
I had exactly the same dream.

456
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:53,690
Why doesn't the captain
say something?

457
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:55,453
We need to be reassured.

458
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:58,394
Actually, I enjoy
a bit of turbulence.

459
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,454
Reminds me
that I'm flying.

460
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,132
Oh!

461
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:05,328
On the other hand...

462
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:07,871
enough is enough.

463
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:18,746
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>this is the Captain speaking.</i>

464
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,250
<i>We apologize</i>
<i>for the rough weather.</i>

465
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,752
<i>I understand some of you</i>
<i>are finding this difficult.</i>

466
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,755
<i>ln an effort to make you</i>
<i>feel at ease,</i>

467
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,314
<i>I want to introduce</i>
<i>a special guest to the cockpit</i>

468
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,121
<i>Miss Julie Andrews.</i>

469
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:32,095
<i>It's all right, everybody.</i>
<i>We'll get through this.</i>

470
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:35,758
<i>Getting to know you</i>

471
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:40,271
<i>Getting to know</i>
<i>all about you</i>

472
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,397
<i>Getting to like you</i>

473
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,476
<i>Getting to hope</i>
<i>you like me...</i>

474
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:48,569
<i>Julie Andrews</i>
<i>is in the cockpit.</i>

475
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,477
<i>Thank God.</i>

476
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:57,388
<i>You are precisely</i>

477
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:59,514
<i>My cup of tea</i>

478
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:02,082
<i>My cup of tea</i>

479
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,788
<i>Getting to know you...</i>

480
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,423
<i>That's great, everyone,</i>
<i>but louder.</i>

481
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,295
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>darling, sing.</i>

482
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,665
<i>When I am with you</i>

483
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:15,638
<i>Getting to know</i>
<i>what to say</i>

484
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:19,143
<i>- ''Haven't you noticed?''</i>
<i>- Haven't you noticed</i>

485
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:23,738
<i>Suddenly I'm bright</i>
<i>and breezy</i>

486
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:26,147
<i>Because of all</i>

487
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,742
<i>The beautiful and new</i>

488
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:32,782
<i>Things I'm learning</i>
<i>about you...</i>

489
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:30,106
And I'd like the card
to say this.

490
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:34,084
''Never regret, never forget.''

491
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,882
Oh, I'm really sorry.

492
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,219
I think someone else
has used this poem.

493
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,952
Let me check my book.

494
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,821
Yes, I'm afraid so.

495
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:49,696
Well...

496
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,291
I have an idea.

497
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,893
Maybe the person
who wrote the poem

498
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,997
would let me pay half the cost
of their wreath.

499
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,200
Do you have their
telephone number?

500
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,209
Could we call and ask?

501
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:03,646
It's not really done.

502
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:06,615
Well,
these are tragic times.

503
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:10,051
The rules change
during tragic times.

504
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:16,086
That's true.
Let me call.

505
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:28,639
Hello? I'm calling
from Lark Floral Arrangements.

506
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,140
No, no problem.

507
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:33,973
Yes, yes they accepted
the credit card.

508
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:37,742
No, there's a woman here
who wants to pay for half your wreath.

509
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:42,445
Well...
I'm not sure why.

510
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,456
- May I speak to them?
- She wants to speak to you.

511
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:49,125
Hello.

512
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,684
An American.
I might have guessed.

513
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,424
Why can't you buy
your own wreath?

514
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:56,092
It isn't the wreath
so much as what you wrote.

515
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,829
Did you write the obituary
in the paper, too?

516
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:00,461
Mmm-hmm.

517
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:03,665
Well, it affected me
very deeply.

518
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:07,575
You see, I had forgotten
about unconditional love.

519
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:09,772
I just clear forgotten.

520
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:12,475
And And when I read
your poem I realized

521
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,849
that that's what I felt
for Victor Fox, and

522
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,013
and for my children...

523
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:21,525
and my husband
once.

524
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:23,583
Um...

525
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:27,097
I don't know you so this
is going to sound strange

526
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:30,134
but it wasn't until
I read your poem

527
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,897
that I realized
why I was here.

528
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,598
Here in Lark,
I mean.

529
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:37,037
I came on impulse

530
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:40,202
as if there was something
that I had to do or to know

531
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:43,872
and I think you're part of it.

532
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:50,051
It would be my honor to share
my wreath with you.

533
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,713
It would?

534
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:54,622
Yes, because you're
completely crazy.

535
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:56,922
Not half crazy
but completely.

536
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:59,258
And that's in the spirit
of Victor's death,

537
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,321
crazy and pointless.

538
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:08,494
l...

539
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:12,275
Just write...

540
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,868
''Love, Grace.''

541
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:20,276
You wouldn't want to get involved
with somebody like him.

542
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:24,348
I don't know why
Mr. Fox put up with him.

543
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:28,253
He knew Victor Fox?

544
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:32,953
He lived with him.

545
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:36,564
He was...

546
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,841
...the valet.

547
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:40,988
What do you want,
''Grandma''?

548
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:45,099
Are you ''D.S.''?

549
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:47,831
- Who?
- D.S.

550
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:54,710
Oh, you mean Dirk.
Dirk Simpson.

551
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:56,871
- I guess.
- Who are you?

552
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,939
You his mum
or something?

553
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:02,649
I'm a mom.

554
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:24,001
He says you're dead.

555
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:28,378
Tell Dirk

556
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:32,575
I was dead,
but now, I'm alive.

557
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:56,269
You are not my mother.

558
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:02,307
You were Victor Fox's valet,
weren't you?

559
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,814
Victor Fox's valet?

560
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,245
Of course, that's who I am.
I'm a valet.

561
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,118
I dressed him in the morning
and I washed his smalls, didn't l?

562
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:13,918
And parked his car.

563
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:17,483
''Parked his car''?
Not in this country, sweetie.

564
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:19,825
Victor didn't have a car
we went everywhere in limos.

565
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:20,864
I don't understand

566
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:23,161
You're just one of those frumps without a
life who fixated on Victor,

567
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:26,465
and now leave stinky, scrawny flowers
all over my front path,

568
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:28,505
telephone me
with bizarre revelations

569
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,267
concerning their pointless,
wretched lives,

570
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:32,342
send me pictures of their
fat middle-aged selves

571
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:34,536
and otherwise push me
to another level of hell!

572
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,113
Get off my property, American frump,
before I call the police.

573
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:39,876
This isn't your property.
You're you're

574
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,611
You're a
You're a squatter!

575
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:44,587
A squatter?
Victor Fox left me this house,

576
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,215
this land and all
his worldly possessions.

577
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,555
I don't believe you.
You're a liar.

578
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,993
- Frump without a life.
- Valet without a car.

579
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:53,894
Life without a point!

580
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:26,061
Psst!

581
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:28,859
Come here.

582
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,730
Come here!

583
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:35,165
Get down.
Get down.

584
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:38,002
- Are you a friend of Dirk's?
- Certainly not.

585
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:41,044
I can't imagine that rude young man
has any friends.

586
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,545
He has several of them,
and they've all taken up residence

587
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:45,377
in Victor Fox's family cottage

588
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:48,475
Three by our estimate
like a nest of rats.

589
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,952
Are you a friend of Victor's?

590
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:53,489
I cared about him very much.

591
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:57,926
Please forgive me.
I'm Nola Fox Worthington.

592
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:01,089
- Victor's sister.
- Victor's sister?

593
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:04,225
One of them.
There are three sisters.

594
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,800
Down! Get down!

595
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,067
This is Lynette Fox-Moore

596
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,234
and her husband,
Barry Moore.

597
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:16,745
- Good afternoon.
- How do you do?

598
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:18,975
- Hello.
- Shh!

599
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:21,517
Come on.

600
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,780
And this
is Harriet Fox-Furrier.

601
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:25,719
She's traveled all the way
from South Africa.

602
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,623
Hello.
I'm the baby.

603
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,455
Grace Beasley.

604
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:33,725
Would you like
a cup of tea, Grace?

605
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:36,062
Oh, that would be lovely.

606
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:38,601
Here, come with us.
We've got our Bentley.

607
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,410
Look at this place.

608
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:57,682
I let pigs live in my house!

609
00:40:57,755 --> 00:41:00,155
Pigs?

610
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:04,558
...have to do
everything myself ow!

611
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:16,664
Victor...

612
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:19,140
you idiot.

613
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:20,640
Picnic.

614
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:23,008
Victor with horse.

615
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:26,778
Look, all padded up.

616
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:30,753
- He was a dear little boy.
- So good-looking.

617
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:46,569
Was he
Was he always artistic?

618
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:50,469
What do you mean,
''artistic?''

619
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:57,708
- Talented.
- Yes, he was always talented.

620
00:41:57,781 --> 00:41:59,373
- And normal.
- Normal.

621
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,543
He played rugby,
soccer, cricket.

622
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:04,087
He hated sports, though.
He preferred dancing.

623
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:06,019
Ballroom dancing, yes.

624
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,955
He did that
to meet girls.

625
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:11,017
Girls, girls, girls.
What a ladykiller.

626
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:15,588
Oh my goodness.

627
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:17,099
We were
We were very close.

628
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:19,465
Close as any brother
and sister could be.

629
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,472
Yes, so close he tried to suffocate
her when she was two.

630
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,173
Healthy sibling rivalry.

631
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:28,871
- Like in any normal, healthy family.
- Normal.

632
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,914
We grew up
in this cottage,

633
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:33,813
with our loving
mother and father.

634
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,317
Yes, we had
our ups and downs.

635
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,184
Flirtations
with psychiatric situations.

636
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:40,883
Domestic violence.
Drug abuse.

637
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:44,052
- Like any normal, healthy family.
- Normal.

638
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:46,460
I can't stand the injustice

639
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,555
of that low life
living in our home.

640
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:51,192
So there's no truth
in what he said?

641
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:58,468
What did he say?

642
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:02,672
Oh, he
He said that

643
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,374
That Victor left
the house to him.

644
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:07,383
Preposterous.

645
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:09,009
There isn't even a will.

646
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:12,544
Why would Victor leave a house worth
a million pounds to the help?

647
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:15,524
He's the worst kind
of employee.

648
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:19,825
How would you feel, Grace,
if an employee of yours

649
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:22,388
moved into your home
after you died

650
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:25,162
and pretended to have
been involved

651
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:27,965
in a perverted
relationship with you?

652
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:31,906
- I don't have any employees.
- If you did?

653
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:36,947
What kind of

654
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:38,981
What kind of perverted
relationship?

655
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,553
Don't think about it, Nola.

656
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,887
He says that Victor
and he were lovers

657
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,984
for over 10 years.

658
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:53,529
- Lovers?
- Yes.

659
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:58,032
You mean...
Victor was

660
00:43:58,102 --> 00:43:59,364
- Yes.
- No!

661
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:01,904
No, no.

662
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:04,839
Victor Fox, the idol
of millions of women

663
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:07,206
all over the world,
a nancy-boy?

664
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:11,039
Nancy-boy.

665
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:26,054
We want to turn the house
into a tribute museum.

666
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,894
A memorial
to the true Victor.

667
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:31,264
The Victor
as we remember him.

668
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,565
The ''Graceland'' for Lark.

669
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:35,605
How do you manage?

670
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,732
Manage?

671
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:43,177
Your busy life.
Your career without any employees.

672
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:47,283
Well, I do it all myself.

673
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:51,219
Well... what is it
you do, exactly?

674
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:54,648
Well...

675
00:44:57,995 --> 00:45:01,123
- I'm a homemaker.
- A what?

676
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,996
A homemaker?

677
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:06,832
But don't doesn't that
I mean

678
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:12,604
You mean
you're a housewife?

679
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:15,577
We thought you were
a record company executive.

680
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:18,171
Something to do with
the entertainment industry.

681
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:21,274
- Why would you think that?
- You're American.

682
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:24,343
So what's your connection
with Victor?

683
00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:31,559
Well, I never knew
Victor, but...

684
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:34,153
I loved him
all the same.

685
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,332
Oh.

686
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:42,202
I've been having tea
with a fan?

687
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:44,797
Get her out of here, Barry.

688
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,705
- Let her finish her tea at least.
- Bill.

689
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:48,938
How much more can I
be expected to endure?

690
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:52,277
I've been pouring out all my private pain
to an autograph dog.

691
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,943
- Hound.
- And now they're playing Victor's music.

692
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:56,485
How tasteless.

693
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:59,954
That's not Victor.
That's Tom Jones.

694
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:02,753
I should know my own brother's
voice when I hear it.

695
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:07,058
Tom's very good,
but he'll never be Victor.

696
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:10,032
Are you telling me I don't know
my own brother's voice?

697
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,364
That's my brother's voice!

698
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:17,635
Actually, it's Tom Jones.
I put the CD on myself.

699
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:21,034
You slut.

700
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:32,410
- Grace.
- Please let me apologize.

701
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:36,050
I don't know why I accepted
Nola's invitation for tea.

702
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:39,391
I guess
I was just curious.

703
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,829
I mean, you being
Victor's family

704
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:44,663
Please, let me apologize.
Nola's very upset.

705
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:48,637
Well of course.
Her brother being killed so horribly.

706
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:51,640
Well, truth be known,
they were estranged for 20 years.

707
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:54,302
Grace, I'm not only
Lynette's husband

708
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:56,379
I'm also
the family lawyer.

709
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,573
My card.
We're

710
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,243
We're in
a sticky situation.

711
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,183
Mr. Simpson
won't speak to us.

712
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:04,845
He won't speak to anyone.

713
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:07,186
You're the first person
he's opened the door for.

714
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:09,725
How would you like to act
as our representative?

715
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:12,887
For a fee, of course.
Use your influence with Mr. Simpson

716
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:15,431
Help him to see
our point of view.

717
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,662
Well, I don't have any influence
with Mr. Simpson.

718
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:20,760
He slammed the door
in my face.

719
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,499
Ah, but first he opened it.

720
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:24,267
I think he'd
listen to you.

721
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:25,864
He'd get a handsome
cash settlement.

722
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:27,637
All he has to do
is disappear.

723
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:29,076
Disappear?

724
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:31,671
No interviews.
No book deals.

725
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:33,648
No public acknowledgement
that he was ever

726
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:36,845
in a relationship with Victor.
Which he wasn't.

727
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:40,378
Help us to convince him
it's time to let go and move on.

728
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:44,322
What if he doesn't want
to let go and move on?

729
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:46,760
We have plan ''B.''

730
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,764
We wait for him
to leave the house.

731
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:51,960
Then he's detained long enough
for us to change the locks.

732
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,230
Detained?

733
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:57,832
lsn't
lsn't that dangerous?

734
00:47:57,941 --> 00:48:00,637
Don't worry.
It wouldn't be me personally.

735
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:03,976
You have my card.

736
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:15,287
I mean this in the best
possible way, Dad.

737
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,850
I think you should
put Mom away.

738
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:21,193
What, in a spa with mud packs
and sulfur baths?

739
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:22,857
- For taking a vacation?
- Not in a spa

740
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:24,833
She's on holiday.

741
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,166
How'd you feel if we put you away?

742
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,797
- Hello?
- Hello, Max?

743
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,966
Grace,
where the hell are you?

744
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,475
I'm in England, Max.
You know that.

745
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:36,944
I know, but where in England?
It's a big country.

746
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:39,414
Well, not really, Max.

747
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:40,780
Not compared
to the United States.

748
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:42,614
Grace, we've been having
a family meeting.

749
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:44,551
You're not going
to get me back

750
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:46,919
by spending all my money
in a foreign country.

751
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,821
Max, I need legal advice.

752
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:51,156
- Legal advice?
- Legal advice?

753
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:53,196
I told you she was
going to flip out.

754
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:56,232
How have you broken the law?
What have you done wrong?

755
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:59,394
Let's say I'm staying in the house
of a dead celebrity.

756
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:00,868
Did you break
into Victor Fox's house?

757
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,372
- She what?
- Shut up! Shut up! Listen.

758
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,374
Maybe it's okay for me
to be there because I was

759
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:11,039
possibly having a long-term relationship
with this dead celebrity.

760
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,342
Grace, you're insane.
Get to a doctor immediately.

761
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:15,579
Now the family
of this dead celebrity

762
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:17,643
Are we talking here
about Victor Fox's family?

763
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:19,586
About Victor Fox's house?

764
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:21,749
- About Victor Fox?
- Yes.

765
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:24,123
What are you
doing in his house?

766
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:27,095
It's not me.
This is all hypothetical.

767
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:31,157
Okay... Let's call
this person ''D.S.''

768
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:33,725
Who's ''D.S.''?

769
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,772
Well, he...

770
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,467
He may
or may not be...

771
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:45,838
He may or may not
be Victor Fox's...

772
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:51,321
Victor Fox's
homosexual lover.

773
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,182
We've got to get
a number on her. Grace?

774
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:59,160
Now, if Victor
died without a will

775
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:02,665
and D.S. claims the house
was left to him verbally,

776
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:06,134
and he was Victor's
''special friend''

777
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:07,898
You're a stalker.

778
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,939
does he have a chance
of keeping the house?

779
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,803
Grace,
give me your number.

780
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:13,341
Of course he gets
to keep the house.

781
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:15,468
Why should he be left with nothing?
Victor promised him.

782
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:17,376
It's not that simple
if there isn't a will.

783
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:20,211
Liberace. His chauffeur sued
the estate and won.

784
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:22,683
Yeah, but there was
evidence there

785
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:24,414
of a long-term,
meaningful relationship.

786
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:26,820
So you're saying there has to be
some kind of written proof?

787
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:28,687
- Joint bank account.
- Name on a phone bill.

788
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:30,590
- Something co-owned.
- Something with both

789
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:34,027
Why am I even discussing
this with you, Grace? I want you back.

790
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:37,089
Not personally.
I want you back in this country.

791
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:39,965
And if you do not return immediately
you will force me

792
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,198
to sell all of our possessions
to pay your bills.

793
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:44,034
I will sell
the furniture

794
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:50,344
Great.

795
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,417
Mmm.

796
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:13,929
Pete, Dave,
get down here.

797
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:23,773
What is it?

798
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:26,372
Dirk, you cooked us breakfast.
Good for you.

799
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,111
This is your first step
on the road to recovery.

800
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:30,050
- I did not do this.
- It's a miracle!

801
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,109
What is that sound?

802
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:33,588
I turned on the hot water tap
and hot water came out.

803
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:36,720
- Dirk, did you fix it?
- No!

804
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:52,141
Go away!
You are not my mother!

805
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:54,404
Leave me alone!

806
00:51:57,347 --> 00:51:59,144
Get off me!

807
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:00,979
I'm calling the police.

808
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:03,918
What's the rush?
At least let her finish the front lawn.

809
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:05,614
Maybe we should
invite her in.

810
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:07,179
She might make us waffles.

811
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,953
She's stopped.

812
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:16,559
Whew!

813
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:19,931
Whoo!

814
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:22,164
Your hot water service
runs on fuel.

815
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:24,172
It's just like the one
in my parents' home.

816
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:26,471
You have to keep putting the fuel in.
Didn't you know that?

817
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:28,067
- I'd like to pay you.
- For what?

818
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:29,611
For the work you've done
and to go away.

819
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:32,011
I don't want to go away.
I want to help you.

820
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:33,913
- How much?
- Very much.

821
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,111
- Dirk, you better get back inside.
- Don't touch me.

822
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:39,178
Barry, the attorney, has men out there
waiting to detain you.

823
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:40,917
He wasn't specific
about the detaining

824
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:43,152
but I don't think it involves
giving you a cup of tea.

825
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:46,855
Did you know that they want to turn
your home into a tribute museum?

826
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:49,956
We have one in Chicago
for Al Capone.

827
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:53,696
It's a disgrace to his memory.
If such a thing is possible.

828
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:58,400
Now, my husband
ex-husband husband, is a lawyer,

829
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:00,806
and he says you need proof
of your relationship with Victor.

830
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:03,311
Love letters,
a joint bank account.

831
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,814
Look, I'm asking you nicely
even though you are a psychotic,

832
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:07,178
please leave.

833
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,512
Let me grieve in peace

834
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:10,177
without you in my kitchen
or my woodpile.

835
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:12,949
Get back inside right now
or I'm gonna give you a great big hug.

836
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,888
Look...

837
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:16,892
...if Victor was here,
do you know what he'd do?

838
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,259
He'd have you arrested.
Victor Fox hated women.

839
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,093
How do you know
what he felt?

840
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:23,860
Haven't you
worked it out yet?

841
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:25,993
- Leave before he hurts your feelings.
- He can be vicious.

842
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:28,128
Victor was gay!
Sissy!

843
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,002
A ''friend of Dorothy''!
A ''nelly''!

844
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:33,672
But his whole life
he had to pretend

845
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:35,802
he was this
heterosexual lover boy

846
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:37,743
just so he could
sell his music to sad,

847
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:39,577
lonely, middle-aged
housewives like you

848
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:42,117
and he hated it.
He hated all of you.

849
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:44,653
He hated his life of lies.

850
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,713
The only thing he
ever loved was me.

851
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:20,713
You make great pancakes.

852
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:36,999
You shouldn't
have done that.

853
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,575
She wasn't like
the others, Dirk.

854
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:44,079
She was like a real mother.
She could cook.

855
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:51,544
How will you get through
the funeral without us?

856
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,452
I'm not going
to the funeral.

857
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:55,753
But you have to go
to the funeral.

858
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:57,952
How can we prove
you had a relationship

859
00:54:58,028 --> 00:54:59,461
if you don't go
to the funeral?

860
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:03,124
You have to make a scene
throw yourself onto the coffin.

861
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:07,469
Dirk...?
Dirk!

862
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:10,506
You'll end up
with nothing.

863
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:13,599
No house, no money
nothing.

864
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:16,270
It'll be like
you never existed.

865
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:19,007
You're a loser, Dirk.

866
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:21,744
Nothing!

867
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:31,158
We had the case won.
Sewn up, we had it won.

868
00:55:31,227 --> 00:55:32,922
Wanker.

869
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:38,665
Hello boys.
Do you fancy a cup of tea?

870
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:41,101
Yeah, that'd be great.
Thanks very much.

871
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:06,876
I'd offer you wine
but I've already drunk it.

872
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,613
- Cough mixture?
- No.

873
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:14,418
Cherry flavor.

874
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,049
No, thank you.

875
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:20,791
- What's your name?
- Grace Beasley.

876
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:24,129
- From Chicago?
- Yes.

877
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,260
Sorry.

878
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:33,969
Brace yourself.

879
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:37,035
Victor's mother's room.

880
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:40,139
Victor and his sisters
were never allowed in here.

881
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:43,481
This is where mummy Fox
came to be alone...

882
00:58:43,553 --> 00:58:46,249
with her dolls.

883
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:07,106
Mummy's wardrobe.

884
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:10,634
Now, in here...

885
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:15,882
is mummy's pink
chiffon robe...

886
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:18,853
with fake diamond tiara.

887
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:22,323
Victor used to sneak in here
when mummy was out,

888
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:27,125
dress up in her clothes
and play with her dolls.

889
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:29,630
He told her he was gay
when he was 16.

890
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:31,530
She blamed herself,

891
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:34,536
and then committed him
to a mental institution.

892
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:39,968
After he was ''cured''
he came back home

893
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,670
waited until his parents
were out

894
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:44,838
slipped in here

895
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:48,748
and smashed every doll
he could get his little gay hands on.

896
00:59:50,453 --> 00:59:52,580
Victor's boyhood bedroom.

897
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:56,887
After the doll incident,
mummy threw him out.

898
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,155
She got all his toys
out of the attic

899
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:01,458
and then redecorated
his room.

900
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:05,524
Set it back it time
to when he was eight years old.

901
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:09,504
She just reinvented
his memory.

902
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,201
The family,

903
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:15,573
more or less,
pretended he was dead.

904
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:18,908
Never mentioned him again.

905
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:23,575
Victor never went to her funeral,

906
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:26,918
but she left him the house
all the same.

907
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:31,017
And he kept it just as it was
in memory of mummy.

908
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:34,086
He used to sit
in that chair

909
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:36,427
smoking his pipe...

910
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:40,401
wearing her pink chiffon robe
and fake diamond tiara.

911
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,529
- No!
- Oh yes.

912
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:44,937
Somehow I don't think
that'll be making it

913
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:47,134
into the tribute museum,
do you?

914
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:54,742
People say
I was a loser...

915
01:00:57,086 --> 01:00:59,077
but really,
it was Victor.

916
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:04,115
He was gonna come out
on an American talk show.

917
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:07,026
lmagine, 55 years old
and he suddenly gets the courage

918
01:01:07,096 --> 01:01:09,064
to tell the world
who he really is...

919
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:13,128
and...

920
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:15,830
he's shot through the heart
with a crossbow.

921
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:19,433
There's no justice.

922
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,611
How did you meet?

923
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:31,982
His voice.
I wanted him to sing my songs.

924
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:35,582
I'm a
I was a songwriter.

925
01:01:35,658 --> 01:01:39,788
And, well I stalked him.
I tracked him down to his recording studio.

926
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:42,092
Forced him to listen
to them.

927
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:45,999
He told me I had
no talent whatsoever,

928
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:47,934
but he asked me out.

929
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,575
- That's what Max said to me.
- What?

930
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:56,076
On our second date,

931
01:01:56,145 --> 01:02:00,138
I told him that I wanted
to be a singer.

932
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,808
Really?

933
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:05,217
And he said he didn't think
that was very realistic...

934
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:08,985
because I was
''too ordinary'' to succeed.

935
01:02:12,095 --> 01:02:14,620
It's the flattery
that reels you, isn't it?

936
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:21,631
I was 25.
He was 45.

937
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:27,404
He was funny.
Generous, drunken,

938
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:30,308
manic-depressive,
self-centered,

939
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:32,677
unfaithful,

940
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,483
terribly unfaithful.

941
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:40,381
Did I say funny?

942
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:42,822
Yes.

943
01:02:42,892 --> 01:02:45,554
Funny,
unfaithful bastard.

944
01:02:45,628 --> 01:02:48,426
You know...

945
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:50,898
a week wouldn't go by

946
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:53,435
without him cheating on me.

947
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:56,267
But he'd say, ''Dirk,

948
01:02:56,339 --> 01:03:00,708
I have sex
with other men...

949
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:03,244
but I sleep with you.''

950
01:03:06,015 --> 01:03:08,245
''Unconditional Love.''

951
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:09,875
What?

952
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:11,886
Your poem.

953
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:15,754
It's cruel.
I was drunk when I wrote that.

954
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:18,157
I should have written,
''Unconditional Masochism.''

955
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:19,922
That's what it was.

956
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:22,157
I don't believe in unconditional love.
What is it?

957
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:25,132
''Cut off my ears, steal my money
and I'll love you anyway''?

958
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:28,068
- Yes. And more.
- More?

959
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:33,532
''You don't have
to love me back.''

960
01:03:44,086 --> 01:03:46,782
God, what I wouldn't give
to get out of here and have a drink.

961
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:50,051
Been cooped up
in here for days.

962
01:03:50,726 --> 01:03:51,351
Ow!

963
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:55,124
Shine that thing down.
They'll see it.

964
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:57,325
Ow!

965
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,459
I can't find my hole.

966
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:01,093
What hole?

967
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:02,831
The hole I made
in your hedge.

968
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:04,998
That's how I broke in.

969
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:08,668
Do they really have
singalongs in English pubs?

970
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:11,474
No, that's something
you read about in guidebooks.

971
01:04:11,547 --> 01:04:14,277
ln real life,
they're bashing up queers.

972
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:16,511
- Maybe we shouldn't go.
- Why?

973
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:19,646
- I forgot how much they hate me.
- That's because you're rude.

974
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:20,689
''Rude''? Excuse me.

975
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:23,190
Do you know what it's like
to be gay in a small village?

976
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:24,850
Yes, I do.

977
01:04:24,927 --> 01:04:28,294
My daughter-in-law
is a dwarf.

978
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,662
Ow!
What?

979
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:33,031
She's a dwarf.
She's different.

980
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:35,263
She's more different than you.

981
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:38,398
People stare at her
wherever she goes.

982
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:42,944
All right. I lose, the dwarf wins.
Better luck next time.

983
01:04:45,915 --> 01:04:48,213
You've got to be kidding.
I'm not getting on that.

984
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:51,082
Come on, Dirk.
It's too far to walk.

985
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:54,088
My little brother and I used to ride double
all the time when we were kids.

986
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:56,886
- He never fell off the handlebars.
- Handlebars?

987
01:04:58,261 --> 01:04:59,660
Live a little.

988
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:02,425
We'll sit by the fire.
We'll toast Victor.

989
01:05:02,498 --> 01:05:05,626
Nobody will even
notice us come in.

990
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:08,967
This doesn't mean
I trust you.

991
01:05:09,038 --> 01:05:12,474
It'll be just like that movie
''Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid''

992
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:14,475
when they go
bicycling together.

993
01:05:14,543 --> 01:05:17,478
I'll be Paul Newman and you'll be
''the lovely Katharine Ross.''

994
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,548
Whatever happened to
''the lovely Katharine Ross''?

995
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:21,378
She fell off the bike
and broke her bloody neck.

996
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:23,975
- Raindrops keep falling on my head...
- Keep it steady!

997
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:28,717
And that doesn't mean my eyes are
too big for my bed

998
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:30,622
Hold on, it's a hill.

999
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:35,027
- No! Put on the brakes!
- Climb every mountain

1000
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:38,157
Ford every stream...

1001
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:40,293
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Slow down!

1002
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:44,104
- Oh dear.
- What do you mean, ''Oh dear''?

1003
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:46,504
- The brakes aren't working.
- No!

1004
01:06:00,222 --> 01:06:01,382
Now she's laughing!

1005
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:03,220
We're going to die
and the mad bitch is laughing!

1006
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:06,853
<i>One who loves</i>
<i>nobody else but you...</i>

1007
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:12,365
Listen,
they are singing.

1008
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:39,184
- To Victor.
- To Victor.

1009
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:56,341
Shh.

1010
01:07:07,723 --> 01:07:10,055
You're not normally
like this, are you?

1011
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:12,955
I mean...

1012
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:15,224
I'm getting to know someone
even you don't recognize.

1013
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:17,060
Right?

1014
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:20,933
If somebody told me Friday
where I'd be on Sunday,

1015
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:22,732
I'd never
have believed them.

1016
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:26,263
But where will you be tomorrow?
And who will you be?

1017
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:27,842
I don't know.

1018
01:07:27,943 --> 01:07:30,468
The problem is you do.

1019
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:33,173
You'll be in Chicago waiting for
your husband to come back.

1020
01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:36,343
You'll be Grace Beasley again
''frump without a life.''

1021
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:42,150
Grace, I think this little adventure
of yours means something.

1022
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:45,853
Or it's just another story you'll tell
in the old people's home.

1023
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:51,026
Does it mean something, Grace?
Hm? Does it?

1024
01:07:52,268 --> 01:07:54,736
- I don't know what it means.
- I do.

1025
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:56,738
I knew what it meant the moment
you broke into my home

1026
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:58,000
and forced meals upon me.

1027
01:07:59,108 --> 01:08:01,440
You're intending to matter,
Grace.

1028
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:03,740
You're returning to life,
only this isn't enough.

1029
01:08:03,813 --> 01:08:05,781
One trip to England never brought
anyone back to life.

1030
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:08,076
This is only
the beginning.

1031
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:10,380
I want us to go to Chicago,

1032
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:13,286
hunt down the Crossbow Killer
and bring him to justice.

1033
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:14,982
There's more.

1034
01:08:15,057 --> 01:08:17,992
The ugly sisters. I want justice there, too.
I want them to suffer.

1035
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:19,925
Vengeance.

1036
01:08:19,995 --> 01:08:23,556
- Anyway, it's all your fault.
- My fault?

1037
01:08:23,632 --> 01:08:26,192
You inspired me, Grace.
With your bravery.

1038
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:29,101
You refused to let everyone's
rejection of you define

1039
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:31,366
what you could probably become
if you had a bit more courage.

1040
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:33,339
- Thank you.
- You showed me the way.

1041
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:35,240
I can't hide
in that house anymore.

1042
01:08:35,311 --> 01:08:38,109
I have to be Dirk Simpson again
and I have to be proud of him.

1043
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:41,240
- Vengeance won't bring Victor back.
- But it will bring us back.

1044
01:08:41,317 --> 01:08:42,750
- How?
- We'll matter again.

1045
01:08:42,852 --> 01:08:46,447
- But there are other ways we can matter.
- Grace...

1046
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:51,016
If I was the valet
and you were the wife,

1047
01:08:51,093 --> 01:08:54,460
neither of us has existed
for some time.

1048
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:00,432
I'm sorry.

1049
01:09:02,037 --> 01:09:04,198
Are you the valet?

1050
01:09:06,275 --> 01:09:08,106
No.

1051
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,108
Yes.

1052
01:09:14,183 --> 01:09:16,208
I mean, no.

1053
01:09:17,253 --> 01:09:19,346
I was his boyfriend...

1054
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:21,753
for over 1 0 years.

1055
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:23,883
- Dirk
- No

1056
01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:26,450
I washed his underwear

1057
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:29,020
and ironed his shirts
occasionally.

1058
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:31,965
But in between all that
I was his boyfriend.

1059
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:36,231
Go on...

1060
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:38,000
what do you want to say?

1061
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:43,068
It's him.

1062
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:47,275
To the memory of Victor Fox.

1063
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:52,820
Victor Fox.

1064
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:11,433
To Victor.

1065
01:10:26,755 --> 01:10:29,656
Who am I
if I'm not Max's wife?

1066
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:33,928
What am I
supposed to be?

1067
01:10:55,618 --> 01:10:57,108
Did I disappoint you, Grace?

1068
01:10:57,186 --> 01:10:59,450
Oh, no, Victor.

1069
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:03,383
Well, mummy's room
was a bit of a shock.

1070
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:09,863
Do you know,
if we had met...

1071
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:13,095
I think I'd have
liked you very much.

1072
01:11:13,168 --> 01:11:16,331
Victor...
you were gay.

1073
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:20,808
Ah, yes.
There was that.

1074
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:23,276
Still...

1075
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:25,404
you're a damn
fine-looking woman, Grace.

1076
01:11:25,514 --> 01:11:29,780
Oh, Victor.

1077
01:11:29,852 --> 01:11:33,083
I always imagined you'd say
something like that.

1078
01:11:38,093 --> 01:11:40,653
Not even a smile, Dirk?

1079
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:44,665
I can't.
I'm too angry with you.

1080
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:47,201
What were you doing down there
under the city anyhow?

1081
01:11:47,269 --> 01:11:49,430
You know why I was there.

1082
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:53,774
I was looking for someone
to help me through the night.

1083
01:11:56,912 --> 01:12:00,404
You found yourself a maniac
in your fucking glittering suit.

1084
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:03,417
He didn't choose me
for my suit.

1085
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:07,379
I'm scared
without you, Victor,

1086
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:10,721
even though
you were a shit.

1087
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:12,886
Dirk...

1088
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:16,897
I had sex
with other men...

1089
01:12:16,965 --> 01:12:20,298
but I slept with you.

1090
01:12:52,234 --> 01:12:54,566
I need to see Victor Fox.
It's an emergency.

1091
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:58,133
He's dead.
He doesn't have emergencies.

1092
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,299
FuneraI's in 1 2 hours.

1093
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:04,038
I'm Victor Fox's loyal valet.
Show him the clipping.

1094
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:07,775
See what it says?
''Victor Fox's loyal valet.''

1095
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:10,045
That's me. I'm here to see that
he's dressed appropriately.

1096
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:12,383
He is dressed appropriately.

1097
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:15,514
His sisters picked out
a nice beige suit.

1098
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:18,617
Beige? He was an entertainer,
not an accountant.

1099
01:13:18,694 --> 01:13:20,594
- He was funny.
- Outrageous.

1100
01:13:20,662 --> 01:13:22,653
Gay and very particular
about his burial garments.

1101
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:24,392
He hated beige.

1102
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:26,627
Who's she?

1103
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:30,695
Oh, this is my lawyer,
Perry Mason.

1104
01:13:31,774 --> 01:13:33,264
Pleased to meet you.

1105
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:36,139
I hope I don't have
to see you in court.

1106
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:11,440
<i>Welcome to Chicago</i>

Thank you so much for coming.

1114
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:37,799
Victor loved you since
he was a little boy.

1115
01:14:37,906 --> 01:14:39,203
Me, too.

1116
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:42,937
I'm so very sorry.
My deepest condolences.

1117

No!

1126
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:33,952
This is outrageous.

1127
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:39,593
<i>Getting to know you</i>

1128
01:16:39,661 --> 01:16:43,688
<i>Getting to feel free and easy</i>

<i>When I am with you</i>

1131
01:16:47,235 --> 01:16:49,260
<i>Getting to know what to say</i>

1132
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:52,000
- Smile for ''The Enquirer.''
- Oh, bugger off.

1133
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:54,075
<i>Haven't you noticed?</i>

1134
01:16:54,176 --> 01:16:58,203
<i>Suddenly I'm bright and breezy</i>

1135
01:17:00,215 --> 01:17:03,844

<i>Day by day.</i>

1138
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:28,036
Well, this is roomy.

1139
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:36,809
Where was Victor killed?

1140
01:17:36,885 --> 01:17:39,319
Can you see from here?

1141
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:41,481
No.

1142
01:17:41,556 --> 01:17:44,047
It's under the city.

1143
01:17:47,362 --> 01:17:51,196
We should sleep tonight
and start tomorrow.

1144
01:18:06,648 --> 01:18:08,343
What's that sound?

1145
01:18:08,417 --> 01:18:11,318
The wind.

1146
01:18:11,386 --> 01:18:14,981
I used to have a noisemaker
to block out the sound

1147
01:18:15,057 --> 01:18:17,389
''Bubbling Brook''...

1148
01:18:17,459 --> 01:18:20,656
''Tropical Surf''...

1149
01:18:20,729 --> 01:18:22,993
''Frogs.''

1150
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:26,266
I love you, Grace.

1151
01:18:27,669 --> 01:18:29,864
I love you too, Dirk.

1152
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:37,401
Grace?

1153
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:58,222
The strangest dream

1154
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:01,660
I was sleeping
with my mother

1155
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:04,699
while being watched
by a dwarf.

1156
01:20:07,002 --> 01:20:09,129
Maudey.

1157
01:20:11,106 --> 01:20:13,472
It's not how it looks.

1158
01:20:13,575 --> 01:20:15,304
Maudey!

1159
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:17,503
Maudey, wait.

1160
01:20:22,918 --> 01:20:24,977
Grace has got a boyfriend!

1161
01:20:25,053 --> 01:20:27,851
He's not
He's not my boyfriend.

1162
01:20:27,923 --> 01:20:30,050
Is he a stud?

1163
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:32,616
A hustler?
Can I try him?

1164
01:20:35,797 --> 01:20:39,028
Ooh.
Look at him.

1165
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:41,330
He's gorgeous.

1166
01:20:41,403 --> 01:20:44,463
All I was expecting you to bring back
from England was a picture of Big Ben.

1167
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:46,598
Maudey, Dirk is gay.

1168
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:48,801
- What?
- He's gay.

1169
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:50,377
This gets better
and better.

1170
01:20:50,478 --> 01:20:53,709
Welcome to Chicago, Dirk.
You naughty confused boy.

1171
01:20:53,782 --> 01:20:56,910
Maudey,
we need your advice.

1172
01:20:56,985 --> 01:20:59,351
Follow your heart.

1173
01:20:59,421 --> 01:21:03,357
Don't let other people's definition
of normal cramp your love life.

1174
01:21:03,425 --> 01:21:06,019
Love a young, gay,

1175
01:21:06,094 --> 01:21:08,619
tall British man
if that's what you want.

1176
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:11,165
No, we need a gun.

1177
01:21:11,233 --> 01:21:13,133
A gun?
Why?

1178
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:14,429
Well...

1179
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:17,528
Dirk was Victor Fox's
longtime companion,

1180
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:19,335
and...

1181
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:21,500
we've decided to hunt down
the Crossbow Killer

1182
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:23,100
and bring him to justice.

1183
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:26,544
I thought it best
to tell it to you straight.

1184
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:29,584
- You've changed, Grace.
- We need it by tonight.

1185
01:21:29,651 --> 01:21:31,983
Something small
that would fit in my purse.

1186
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:34,146
You mean...

1187
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:36,349
something like...

1188
01:21:36,424 --> 01:21:38,551
...this?

1189
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:42,928
Oh my God!
Where did you get that?

1190
01:21:42,998 --> 01:21:44,590
Does Andrew know
you have that?

1191
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:47,863
Oh get real, Grace.
You know how paranoid he is.

1192
01:21:47,936 --> 01:21:50,063
He gave it to me
after Pokey was born.

1193
01:21:50,138 --> 01:21:53,107
- Along with diapers.
- Can I see it?

1194
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:55,199
Have either of you
ever fired a gun before?

1195
01:22:09,691 --> 01:22:11,556
Why are you wearing
that ridiculous coat?

1196
01:22:11,626 --> 01:22:13,287
''Don't Look Now.''

1197
01:22:13,361 --> 01:22:15,158
It's a disgusting
offensive movie

1198
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:17,164
about a psychotic dwarf
in a red raincoat

1199
01:22:17,232 --> 01:22:19,132
who cuts people's throats.

1200
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,293
- Never heard of it.
- Doesn't matter.

1201
01:22:21,369 --> 01:22:23,837
Nobody messes with a dwarf
in a red raincoat.

1202
01:22:31,179 --> 01:22:32,669
What time is it?

1203
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:36,080
It's 3:30.
We should stop for a while.

1204
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:38,449
Coffee?

1205
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:43,925
Grace.

1206
01:22:43,992 --> 01:22:45,619
I smell coffee.

1207
01:22:47,395 --> 01:22:50,057
- Would you like some?
- Grace!

1208
01:22:53,868 --> 01:22:55,836
Grace.

1209
01:22:55,904 --> 01:22:58,338
Oh, hello.

1210
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:00,237
Coffee?

1211
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:07,709
Come here often?

1212
01:23:09,517 --> 01:23:11,610
- Ham and cheese?
- Everyone

1213
01:23:11,686 --> 01:23:13,654
Everyone!

1214
01:23:13,722 --> 01:23:16,122
Can I ask you fine people
a question?

1215
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:21,087
Do any of you know
the whereabouts

1216
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:25,622
or the identity
of the Crossbow Killer?

1217
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:28,726
That bastard!
That bastard!

1218
01:23:28,803 --> 01:23:30,896
That bastard!
That bastard!

1219
01:23:30,972 --> 01:23:33,668
Bastard! That bastard!
That bastard!

1220
01:23:33,775 --> 01:23:36,141
Why you bring him up?
That bastard killed Bill.

1221
01:23:36,211 --> 01:23:38,771
And he killed Alice.
Sweet old Alice...

1222
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:41,110
- singing all the time.
- Singing all the time.

1223
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:43,116
It wasn't Alice who sang.
It was Bill.

1224
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:44,776
- It was Alice.
- It was Bill!

1225
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:47,014
- It was Alice!
- Maybe they both sang.

1226
01:23:47,088 --> 01:23:50,285
- You don't know!
- We're gonna catch the Crossbow Killer.

1227
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:52,292
He comes quietly,

1228
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:55,761
or we blow him away.

1229
01:23:58,299 --> 01:24:00,199
No.

1230
01:24:01,069 --> 01:24:02,661
Mmm.

1231
01:24:02,737 --> 01:24:04,864
Some vigilantes.

1232
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:07,407
Officially sanctioned
by the homeless.

1233
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:11,239
I saw something.

1234
01:24:14,416 --> 01:24:16,213
What is that?

1235
01:24:17,519 --> 01:24:19,578
- It's the cops.
- Oh my God.

1236
01:24:19,654 --> 01:24:21,884
- Dirk, kiss Grace passionately.
- What?

1237
01:24:21,956 --> 01:24:24,015
I have a gun in my jacket.
We're vigilantes.

1238
01:24:24,092 --> 01:24:25,684
They'll think you're lovers.
Kiss her.

1239
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:27,352
- No.
- Then kiss me.

1240
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:29,021
I'm not kissing anyone.

1241
01:24:42,844 --> 01:24:43,572
Did you see that?

1242
01:24:43,678 --> 01:24:46,112
What?

1243
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:50,744
Did you ever see a movie called
''Don't Look Now''?

1244
01:25:10,371 --> 01:25:12,737
What are you
doing down here?

1245
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:14,468
Um...

1246
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:17,878
I was necking
with my boyfriend.

1247
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:20,972
Dirk!

1248
01:25:21,082 --> 01:25:23,880
Good evening, officers.

1249
01:25:26,821 --> 01:25:29,153
You this young lady's boyfriend?

1250
01:25:34,195 --> 01:25:35,685
I am.

1251
01:25:37,732 --> 01:25:39,563
What are you doing?

1252
01:25:39,634 --> 01:25:41,261
I was watching them.

1253
01:25:41,336 --> 01:25:43,600
You know these people?

1254
01:25:43,671 --> 01:25:46,071
- Yes.
- No.

1255
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:48,937
Oops.

1256
01:25:53,648 --> 01:25:56,811
Don't worry. Nothing terrible.
Carrying a concealed weapon.

1257
01:25:56,885 --> 01:26:00,286
And if you brought Pokey here
to shame me, it didn't work.

1258
01:26:00,355 --> 01:26:04,451
It was my first offense so they knocked it
down to a misdemeanor.

1259
01:26:04,526 --> 01:26:07,689
Oh, Mommy missed you.

1260
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:18,935
What are you doing?

1261
01:26:24,779 --> 01:26:27,441
There's a court
appearance next week.

1262
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:30,109
There'll be a significant fine to pay.

1263
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:35,913
They didn't charge you,
Grace, or, um

1264
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:37,287
Dirk.

1265
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:43,353
That's Dirk?

1266
01:26:43,431 --> 01:26:45,365
Mm-hm.

1267
01:26:46,568 --> 01:26:48,160
Thank you
for coming, Max.

1268
01:26:48,236 --> 01:26:50,534
Oh, no.

1269
01:26:52,006 --> 01:26:54,634
We need to talk, Grace.

1270
01:26:54,742 --> 01:26:56,334
You sold our furniture.

1271
01:26:56,444 --> 01:26:59,845
Oh, no, no.
I was angry.

1272
01:26:59,914 --> 01:27:01,745
It's really
back in my place.

1273
01:27:01,816 --> 01:27:03,215
Oh.

1274
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:11,616
Uh, look.
Why don't I take you to breakfast?

1275
01:27:25,573 --> 01:27:28,041
Well, you're
not dull anymore, Grace.

1276
01:27:31,346 --> 01:27:34,281
I was the one who wanted
to do dangerous things.

1277
01:27:34,349 --> 01:27:35,782
Look at you
in the last two weeks.

1278
01:27:35,883 --> 01:27:38,716
You've been to England.
Tracked a serial killer.

1279
01:27:38,786 --> 01:27:42,244
Been arrested.
Made new friends.

1280
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:46,723
All I've done
is changed apartments.

1281
01:27:46,794 --> 01:27:50,025
I haven't even managed
to unpack my things.

1282
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,468
I don't want a divorce.

1283
01:27:58,606 --> 01:28:01,541
Dirk,
Grace is my wife,

1284
01:28:01,643 --> 01:28:04,009
and I am going
to fight you for her.

1285
01:28:05,847 --> 01:28:08,645
I realize I've been
a complete fool.

1286
01:28:08,716 --> 01:28:13,153
And I guess what I'm asking is that
you give up Dirk here.

1287
01:28:13,221 --> 01:28:15,712
But Max, darling,
I'm afraid you're ow!

1288
01:28:19,861 --> 01:28:22,421
Yeah, but then again, Max.

1289
01:28:22,497 --> 01:28:25,398
Look here, Max...

1290
01:28:27,001 --> 01:28:29,231
Grace is my woman now.

1291
01:28:32,373 --> 01:28:35,137
Grace, I know he's young.
And handsome.

1292
01:28:35,243 --> 01:28:37,234
Oh, thanks.

1293
01:28:37,345 --> 01:28:40,542
But we've put in a lot
of years together, kid.

1294
01:28:40,615 --> 01:28:43,812
And when you've got
two people like us,

1295
01:28:43,885 --> 01:28:47,878
with all the good stuff behind us

1296
01:28:47,955 --> 01:28:50,583
and good stuff that could be,

1297
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:55,721
it just doesn't make sense to discard it,
right? I mean, it

1298
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:02,398
First time we met,
how cold it was.

1299
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:05,462
You lent me your scarf.

1300
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:10,000
And then that silly little apartment
in Milwaukee my first job.

1301
01:29:11,746 --> 01:29:16,649
How far would I travel
to be where you are?

1302
01:29:16,751 --> 01:29:20,619
What is the distance
from here to a star?

1303
01:29:20,688 --> 01:29:25,148
And if I ever lost you,
how much would I cry?

1304
01:29:25,226 --> 01:29:28,127
How deep is the ocean...

1305
01:29:36,904 --> 01:29:40,931
Ah... you don't
want to take me back.

1306
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:43,101
It's over.

1307
01:29:47,415 --> 01:29:49,645
Max!

1308
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:53,317
Max!

1309
01:30:02,430 --> 01:30:05,092
He needs me.

1310
01:30:08,202 --> 01:30:11,399
He fought for me.

1311
01:30:11,472 --> 01:30:14,032
Nobody's ever fought for me.

1312
01:30:20,548 --> 01:30:22,277
Here's the key
to my apartment.

1313
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:26,480
It was staring us
in the face all the time.

1314
01:30:26,554 --> 01:30:28,545
What was?

1315
01:30:28,623 --> 01:30:31,990
The reason he chose Victor,
and the tramps.

1316
01:30:34,529 --> 01:30:37,623
There wasn't a reason.

1317
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:43,097
I want you to stay
as long as you like.

1318
01:30:48,242 --> 01:30:51,609
Off you go.

1319
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:09,124
I'm British
and I need a gun.

1320
01:31:09,864 --> 01:31:10,990
Oh!

1321
01:31:11,065 --> 01:31:14,398
It's...
Nice, Max.

1322
01:31:15,736 --> 01:31:19,729
It... It doesn't
feel like home.

1323
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:24,535
Do you know
what I'd like to do?

1324
01:31:24,645 --> 01:31:27,079
- What's that?
- I'd like to sing.

1325
01:31:27,148 --> 01:31:29,742
- Why don't you?
- You mean it?

1326
01:31:29,817 --> 01:31:33,253
I missed your singing.
It always drove me crazy but...

1327
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:35,448
when it wasn't there
I really missed it.

1328
01:31:35,523 --> 01:31:37,957
Oh, no. I don't mean
around the house.

1329
01:31:38,025 --> 01:31:40,550
I mean,
sing to people.

1330
01:31:42,063 --> 01:31:44,531
You mean in public?

1331
01:31:44,599 --> 01:31:47,227
Yeah. I'd be scared,
but yeah.

1332
01:31:47,301 --> 01:31:49,292
ln a bar.

1333
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:53,167
You want to be
a lounge singer?

1334
01:31:53,274 --> 01:31:57,301
Well, at first.
And then, who knows?

1335
01:31:57,411 --> 01:32:00,471
I mean,
anything's possible.

1336
01:32:00,548 --> 01:32:03,108
Well, I agree
that anything's possible

1337
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:05,311
but it's not
very realistic, is it?

1338
01:32:05,386 --> 01:32:08,480
I mean,
shouldn't you have...

1339
01:32:08,556 --> 01:32:12,219
explored this line
of work earlier...

1340
01:32:12,293 --> 01:32:14,818
when you were younger?

1341
01:32:14,896 --> 01:32:17,797
So that you might have
had the opportunity

1342
01:32:17,865 --> 01:32:21,733
and the time to
to fail?

1343
01:32:21,802 --> 01:32:24,930
But what about
dangerous things, Max?

1344
01:32:25,006 --> 01:32:28,942
Oh, I think we've done
our dangerous things.

1345
01:32:29,043 --> 01:32:32,501
I mean, I've had enough danger
to last a lifetime.

1346
01:32:34,448 --> 01:32:36,143
So...

1347
01:32:37,919 --> 01:32:39,682
you want it
the way it was?

1348
01:32:39,754 --> 01:32:44,157
No.
Similar, but different.

1349
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:10,639
''Hello, you've reached
Andrew and Maudey.

1350
01:34:10,711 --> 01:34:12,611
That's right,
we're back together.

1351
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:15,877
So for those of you who doubted that
this was a marriage made in heaven,

1352
01:34:15,950 --> 01:34:17,941
Fuck you!''

1353
01:34:18,019 --> 01:34:19,919
No, too bitter.

1354
01:34:20,955 --> 01:34:23,116
''Hello, I'm a goddess.

1355
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:26,421
He got down on his knees
and begged me.''

1356
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:29,190
Hello.

1357
01:34:29,263 --> 01:34:31,094
- Maudey?
- Grace?

1358
01:34:31,165 --> 01:34:33,827
Why do you think the Crossbow Killer
chose Victor?

1359
01:34:34,869 --> 01:34:37,599
Grace, remember closure?
Well, we closed.

1360
01:34:37,672 --> 01:34:40,368
But Dirk said
there was a reason.

1361
01:34:40,474 --> 01:34:42,499
He said it was staring us
in the face.

1362
01:34:42,610 --> 01:34:44,601
The reason is
he met a psycho.

1363
01:34:44,712 --> 01:34:47,010
It could have been anyone.

1364
01:34:47,081 --> 01:34:49,174
But it wasn't anyone.
It was Victor Fox.

1365
01:34:49,250 --> 01:34:52,549
- And two tramps.
- We got what we wanted.

1366
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:55,145
I got Andrew,
you got Max.

1367
01:34:55,222 --> 01:34:58,089
We should be happy and getting on
with our new lives.

1368
01:34:58,159 --> 01:34:59,683
What about Dirk?

1369
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:01,819
No matter what I do...

1370
01:35:01,896 --> 01:35:03,830
Go back to bed, Grace.

1371
01:35:03,898 --> 01:35:06,696
Whatever happened between you
and Dirk is over.

1372
01:35:06,767 --> 01:35:08,632
Doesn't matter where you go
or what you do

1373
01:35:08,703 --> 01:35:12,469
I want to spend each day
of my life with you...

1374
01:35:12,573 --> 01:35:16,634
You're right.
I got what I wanted.

1375
01:35:16,744 --> 01:35:18,939
Didn't I?

1376
01:35:19,013 --> 01:35:21,140
- Now listen, honey...
- It's singing.

1377
01:35:21,215 --> 01:35:24,082
- What?
- Remember what the tramp said?

1378
01:35:24,151 --> 01:35:26,176
The ones who were killed
were singing all the time.

1379
01:35:26,253 --> 01:35:30,212
- What if Victor was singing too?
- He kills anyone who sings.

1380
01:37:38,485 --> 01:37:41,010
Grace!

1381
01:37:41,088 --> 01:37:43,522
Grace!

1382
01:38:22,563 --> 01:38:24,793
What are you doing?

1383
01:38:26,867 --> 01:38:28,960
I'm trying to attract
the Crossbow Killer.

1384
01:38:29,036 --> 01:38:30,799
We thought you were
going to sing.

1385
01:38:30,871 --> 01:38:33,567
- Were did you get that gun?
- What are you wearing?

1386
01:38:33,674 --> 01:38:36,609
It's Victor's. He wore a suit like this
on the night he died.

1387
01:38:36,710 --> 01:38:38,769
Dirk, you're gonna
get yourself killed.

1388
01:38:38,879 --> 01:38:40,210
You know what Victor
used to say?

1389
01:38:40,281 --> 01:38:42,545
''A life lived in fear

1390
01:38:42,616 --> 01:38:44,709
isn't a life worth living.''

1391
01:38:46,287 --> 01:38:48,255
- No he didn't.
- What do you mean, ''No he didn't''?

1392
01:38:48,322 --> 01:38:52,258
He said, ''A life lived in fear...
isn't much fun.''

1393
01:38:52,326 --> 01:38:54,419
- ''lsn't much fun''?
- Yes, worth living but not much fun.

1394
01:38:54,495 --> 01:38:56,827
- Come off it. Victor would never say that.
- Can we get out of here?

1395
01:38:56,897 --> 01:39:00,355
I happen to know he did.
A bartender told me.

1396
01:39:00,434 --> 01:39:02,493
Does Max love you?

1397
01:39:04,171 --> 01:39:07,800
It's a simple question.
Did he tell you he loved you?

1398
01:39:09,777 --> 01:39:11,836
ln his way.

1399
01:39:11,946 --> 01:39:13,573
Good.

1400
01:39:13,647 --> 01:39:15,581
Now piss off.

1401
01:39:15,683 --> 01:39:20,313
Unlike the two of you,
I have fears to face.

1402
01:39:28,696 --> 01:39:31,688
- Dirk, you did it.
- Now what?

1403
01:39:31,765 --> 01:39:33,460
I don't know.
I didn't think it would work.

1404
01:39:33,534 --> 01:39:35,832
Don't move. Far as I know he can only
shoot one of us at a time.

1405
01:39:35,903 --> 01:39:37,734
- Which one?
- You're the one in the glitter suit.

1406
01:39:37,805 --> 01:39:38,999
Stay together.

1407
01:39:39,073 --> 01:39:40,904
Maybe you shouldn't stay
too close to Dirk, Grace.

1408
01:39:41,008 --> 01:39:42,703
God, I think I just got us all killed.

1409
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:44,368
No!

1410
01:39:46,547 --> 01:39:48,606
You I know you.

1411
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:51,149
Who?

1412
01:39:51,218 --> 01:39:53,118
You're her in the room
with the baby.

1413
01:39:53,187 --> 01:39:55,382
You mean Pokey?

1414
01:39:55,456 --> 01:39:57,890
You saw me
with my grandson?

1415
01:39:59,493 --> 01:40:01,324
Who are you?

1416
01:40:10,938 --> 01:40:13,202
I do know you.

1417
01:40:14,708 --> 01:40:16,699
You clean my windows.

1418
01:40:19,346 --> 01:40:22,281
Seeing you
and that baby dancing...

1419
01:40:24,084 --> 01:40:26,951
reminded me of my mother...

1420
01:40:27,021 --> 01:40:30,479
and her love.

1421
01:40:32,693 --> 01:40:35,321
For God's sake,
say something.

1422
01:40:35,396 --> 01:40:36,795
Yes

1423
01:40:36,864 --> 01:40:38,889
You're not gonna be loved
pointing a crossbow at people.

1424
01:40:38,966 --> 01:40:41,059
You!

1425
01:40:41,135 --> 01:40:44,070
- You're just like everybody else!
- No, we're not!

1426
01:40:44,138 --> 01:40:46,265
Look at us.
Do we look like everybody else?

1427
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:48,308
We're not.
We're like you.

1428
01:40:48,409 --> 01:40:50,309
We're unloved, unnoticed.

1429
01:40:50,377 --> 01:40:52,368
I am not unnoticed.
Don't you read the papers?

1430
01:40:52,479 --> 01:40:54,845
Yes you're very famous.
Even I've heard of you, and I'm British.

1431
01:40:54,915 --> 01:40:56,109
I know that jacket.

1432
01:40:56,183 --> 01:40:58,014
No, you don't.
Everyone's wearing them in Britain

1433
01:40:58,085 --> 01:40:59,746
They're all the rage.
The streets are a-glitter.

1434
01:40:59,820 --> 01:41:02,550
What were you and the baby dancing to?
What was that song?

1435
01:41:05,893 --> 01:41:09,021
It was a song
by Victor Fox.

1436
01:41:10,364 --> 01:41:12,298
Oh.

1437
01:41:14,701 --> 01:41:17,033
I didn't mean
to hurt him.

1438
01:41:17,104 --> 01:41:20,130
My mother had a lot
of his records.

1439
01:41:21,642 --> 01:41:23,576
But he was walking alone
and he was singing

1440
01:41:23,644 --> 01:41:26,772
and when they sing it makes me think of
my mother and I get sad.

1441
01:41:26,847 --> 01:41:29,645
I have to make
them stop.

1442
01:41:34,755 --> 01:41:37,246
What was that song
you were singing to the baby?

1443
01:41:37,324 --> 01:41:39,349
What?

1444
01:41:41,562 --> 01:41:42,790
Was it...

1445
01:41:42,863 --> 01:41:44,922
Was it
''I Can't Smile Without You''?

1446
01:41:44,998 --> 01:41:47,660
My mother used to sing that to me
when I was little.

1447
01:41:47,734 --> 01:41:49,361
- No...
- Yes, it was.

1448
01:41:49,436 --> 01:41:51,904
Yes, it was.

1449
01:41:51,972 --> 01:41:53,405
Yes, it was.

1450
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:00,845
How does that go again?

1451
01:42:00,914 --> 01:42:02,677
Huh?

1452
01:42:02,749 --> 01:42:04,740
All right,
sing it for me!

1453
01:42:19,099 --> 01:42:21,932
<i>You know I...</i>

1454
01:42:22,002 --> 01:42:27,941
<i>Can't smile without you</i>

1455
01:42:28,041 --> 01:42:33,479
<i>I can't smile without you</i>

1456
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:39,143
<i>I can't laugh and I can't sing</i>

1457
01:42:39,219 --> 01:42:45,454
<i>I'm finding it hard to do anything</i>

1458
01:42:45,526 --> 01:42:49,792
<i>You see, I feel sad</i>

1459
01:42:49,863 --> 01:42:53,162
<i>When you're sad</i>

1460
01:43:08,382 --> 01:43:12,910
<i>Feel glad when you're glad</i>

1461
01:43:12,986 --> 01:43:15,147
<i>If you only knew</i>

1462
01:43:15,222 --> 01:43:18,521
<i>What I'm going through</i>

1463
01:43:18,592 --> 01:43:22,653
<i>I just can't smile</i>

1464
01:43:22,729 --> 01:43:26,688
<i>Without you</i>

1465
01:43:26,767 --> 01:43:29,861
<i>You came along</i>

1466
01:43:29,937 --> 01:43:32,337
<i>Just like a song</i>

1467
01:43:32,406 --> 01:43:35,273
<i>And brightened my day</i>

1468
01:43:35,375 --> 01:43:39,311
<i>Who'd have believed that you</i>
<i>were part of a dream?</i>

1469
01:43:39,413 --> 01:43:42,473
<i>Now it all seems</i>

1470
01:43:42,549 --> 01:43:45,643
<i>Light-years away</i>

1471
01:43:45,719 --> 01:43:52,124
<i>Now you know</i>
<i>I can't smile without you</i>

1472
01:43:52,192 --> 01:43:56,822
<i>I can't smile without you</i>

1473
01:43:56,897 --> 01:43:59,263
<i>I can't laugh</i>

1474
01:43:59,333 --> 01:44:01,198
<i>I can't sing</i>

1475
01:44:01,268 --> 01:44:05,671
<i>I'm finding it hard</i>
<i>to do anything</i>

1476
01:44:05,739 --> 01:44:10,904
<i>You see, I feel sad</i>
<i>when you're sad</i>

1477
01:44:11,011 --> 01:44:14,845
<i>I feel glad</i>
<i>when you're glad</i>

1478
01:44:14,915 --> 01:44:17,782
<i>If you only knew</i>

1479
01:44:17,851 --> 01:44:20,877
<i>What I'm going through</i>

1480
01:44:20,954 --> 01:44:26,551
<i>I just can't smile</i>

1481
01:44:26,627 --> 01:44:31,690
<i>Without you.</i>

1482
01:45:10,037 --> 01:45:12,198
Oh, God.

1483
01:45:12,272 --> 01:45:14,365
I'm sorry.

1484
01:45:14,474 --> 01:45:17,272
I'm sor...

1485
01:45:47,007 --> 01:45:48,565
''V.F.''?

1486
01:45:48,675 --> 01:45:51,610
''V.F.''!?

1487
01:45:51,678 --> 01:45:54,875
Victor Fox!
You knew him!

1488
01:45:54,948 --> 01:45:57,610
Liars!
Stinking liars!

1489
01:45:57,684 --> 01:45:59,709
Run!

1490
01:46:01,788 --> 01:46:04,086
- Gun!
- Maudey, get the gun.

1491
01:46:04,157 --> 01:46:05,488
I got it.

1492
01:46:24,578 --> 01:46:27,046
Run!

1493
01:46:29,916 --> 01:46:31,816
Maudey!

1494
01:46:37,090 --> 01:46:39,285
Grace!
Wait!

1495
01:46:39,359 --> 01:46:41,418
Dirk!

1496
01:46:44,197 --> 01:46:46,392
Run!

1497
01:46:58,078 --> 01:46:59,443
Jump!

1498
01:47:00,714 --> 01:47:02,375
Ugh!

1499
01:47:06,086 --> 01:47:08,213
Christ!
Grace!

1500
01:47:08,288 --> 01:47:11,746
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

1501
01:47:11,825 --> 01:47:13,690
Oop!

1502
01:47:15,762 --> 01:47:17,992
Don't let me die
in a glitter suit!

1503
01:47:21,234 --> 01:47:22,496
My leg! Oh!

1504
01:47:40,987 --> 01:47:44,047
Hold on! Maudey,
grab onto something!

1505
01:47:44,124 --> 01:47:46,524
Ah! Get off!
Get off!

1506
01:47:46,593 --> 01:47:48,390
Get off it!
Get off!

1507
01:47:48,462 --> 01:47:51,090
I don't want to die!

1508
01:47:55,302 --> 01:47:57,736
Don't let go.

1509
01:47:57,804 --> 01:47:59,328
Maudey!

1510
01:48:03,176 --> 01:48:05,269
- Grace!
- Grace!

1511
01:48:11,952 --> 01:48:14,318
No.

1512
01:48:20,894 --> 01:48:23,920
All right, that's it.
Don't come any closer, you freak.

1513
01:48:23,997 --> 01:48:28,434
I'm calling the police.
I can get a signal up here.

1514
01:48:28,502 --> 01:48:31,938
You're gonna wish you never met me.
You're in big trouble now.

1515
01:48:32,005 --> 01:48:35,736
- Please...?
- You piece of shit.

1516
01:48:52,759 --> 01:48:54,386
Oh my God!

1517
01:49:13,914 --> 01:49:15,609
- Hello.
- Max?

1518
01:49:15,682 --> 01:49:17,775
- Grace, where are you?
- I'm with Dirk.

1519
01:49:21,254 --> 01:49:24,883
- Dirk?
- He's in emergency. I can't talk long.

1520
01:49:24,958 --> 01:49:27,927
- Which hospital? I'm on my way.
- No.

1521
01:49:29,362 --> 01:49:31,557
Max...

1522
01:49:31,631 --> 01:49:34,532
we need to discuss
our marriage.

1523
01:49:36,536 --> 01:49:38,902
Our marriage?

1524
01:49:41,675 --> 01:49:43,802
I'm sorry, Max.

1525
01:49:43,910 --> 01:49:46,208
I love you.

1526
01:49:48,181 --> 01:49:50,308
I always have.

1527
01:49:50,383 --> 01:49:54,114
But I never expected you
to say it back.

1528
01:49:55,956 --> 01:49:58,015
That wasn't a condition

1529
01:49:58,091 --> 01:50:02,050
Because I was too afraid
of the answer.

1530
01:50:03,563 --> 01:50:06,259
Now it is a condition.

1531
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:11,332
I don't want
''similar but different.''

1532
01:50:11,404 --> 01:50:13,702
I need different.

1533
01:50:16,076 --> 01:50:21,571
Well, I... don't know
if I know how to be different.

1534
01:50:24,050 --> 01:50:26,280
Find a way.

1535
01:50:26,353 --> 01:50:29,948
We've read about them
and we've seen them on the news,

1536
01:50:30,023 --> 01:50:32,719
but who are they really?

1537
01:50:32,792 --> 01:50:34,919
Please help me to welcome

1538
01:50:34,995 --> 01:50:38,487
Chicago's own
Crossbow Killer heroes,

1539
01:50:38,565 --> 01:50:40,726
Grace Beasley...

1540
01:50:47,107 --> 01:50:50,474
Maudey Beasley...

1541
01:50:52,946 --> 01:50:55,779
and Dirk Simpson!

1542
01:51:03,790 --> 01:51:05,849
Wow!

1543
01:51:05,925 --> 01:51:08,985
Is that the way it felt
these last few weeks?

1544
01:51:09,062 --> 01:51:10,962
Whoo!
Wow!

1545
01:51:12,465 --> 01:51:15,059
Yeah, absolute wow, Sally.

1546
01:51:15,135 --> 01:51:17,035
All right!

1547
01:51:18,271 --> 01:51:23,231
Maudey, facing death
completely unarmed,

1548
01:51:23,343 --> 01:51:27,609
you take out the Crossbow Killer
with a mobile phone.

1549
01:51:27,681 --> 01:51:31,777
That must have been
a ''David-and-Goliath'' moment for you.

1550
01:51:32,919 --> 01:51:34,750
Actually, Sally...

1551
01:51:34,821 --> 01:51:37,949
I was really fed up
with the phone.

1552
01:51:41,928 --> 01:51:43,623
Batteries always seem to die

1553
01:51:43,697 --> 01:51:45,289
in the middle of your
most important calls.

1554
01:51:45,365 --> 01:51:47,424
Haven't you noticed that?

1555
01:51:51,271 --> 01:51:54,832
That's why I was so excited
when Sprint PCS approached me

1556
01:51:54,941 --> 01:51:58,035
with this new state-of-the-art
digital phone.

1557
01:51:58,144 --> 01:52:00,908
With batteries that have
five days' standby time,

1558
01:52:00,980 --> 01:52:04,541
I know if I'm ever cornered by another
crossbow-wielding maniac

1559
01:52:04,617 --> 01:52:06,608
my call will get through.

1560
01:52:06,686 --> 01:52:10,122
Dirk, you've lost
the love of your life,

1561
01:52:10,190 --> 01:52:13,489
and then you
avenged his death.

1562
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:18,793
You are one macho,
take-charge kind of guy.

1563
01:52:18,865 --> 01:52:20,264
I love you, Dirk!

1564
01:52:20,333 --> 01:52:22,392
Dirk, I love you!

1565
01:52:24,604 --> 01:52:27,596
Is it over?
Can you move on?

1566
01:52:28,975 --> 01:52:32,069
Well, I'm lucky to have friends.
And, actually,

1567
01:52:32,178 --> 01:52:36,114
the Fox sisters have been incredibly
supportive since Victor died.

1568
01:52:36,216 --> 01:52:38,275
That's why I invited them
here tonight.

1569
01:52:38,351 --> 01:52:40,342
Nola, Harriet, Lynette,

1570
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:42,820
please stand up
so that we can see you.

1571
01:52:44,491 --> 01:52:48,257
The loving sisters
of Victor Fox.

1572
01:52:53,333 --> 01:52:55,824
I couldn't have got through
this ordeal without them.

1573
01:52:55,902 --> 01:52:59,167
ln fact, they have
given me Victor's house.

1574
01:53:00,206 --> 01:53:01,138
No.

1575
01:53:01,241 --> 01:53:02,868
- Yes.
- Incredible.

1576
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:05,877
- Isn't it?
- Wonderful.

1577
01:53:06,946 --> 01:53:09,039
I want to make it
into a hostel

1578
01:53:09,115 --> 01:53:11,549
for gay youths who've been
kicked out of their homes

1579
01:53:11,618 --> 01:53:13,313
by their intolerant families.

1580
01:53:13,386 --> 01:53:15,411
I think Victor would have
wanted it that way.

1581
01:53:15,488 --> 01:53:18,924
I know the Fox sisters
want it that way.

1582
01:53:27,834 --> 01:53:30,234
We love gay youth.

1583
01:53:41,848 --> 01:53:43,008
Grace!

1584
01:53:53,993 --> 01:53:56,757
It's been quite a journey.

1585
01:53:56,830 --> 01:53:59,492
We've read about you.
We've heard about you.

1586
01:53:59,566 --> 01:54:01,898
What is there left to say?

1587
01:54:01,968 --> 01:54:04,528
Actually,

1588
01:54:04,604 --> 01:54:07,835
I have something
I'd like to say.

1589
01:54:07,941 --> 01:54:11,138
Sir, what is your name?

1590
01:54:14,113 --> 01:54:15,944
My name is Max Beasley

1591
01:54:16,015 --> 01:54:20,679
and I'm Grace's husband
ex-husband.

1592
01:54:24,257 --> 01:54:26,748
Yes, Max.
What would you like to tell us?

1593
01:54:26,826 --> 01:54:30,785
Well, it's not much, really.
Just that...

1594
01:54:30,864 --> 01:54:33,560
I'd like to hear
Grace sing.

1595
01:54:35,201 --> 01:54:37,533
Come on, sing it, girl.

1596
01:54:37,604 --> 01:54:40,004
Sing it, baby.

1597
01:54:41,241 --> 01:54:43,232
Thank you, Max.

1598
01:54:43,343 --> 01:54:47,143
I think we have
a surprise for you, Grace.

1599
01:54:49,282 --> 01:54:50,772
Oh my

1600
01:54:50,884 --> 01:54:55,014
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Barry Manilow.

1601
01:54:55,088 --> 01:55:01,493
<i>You know I can't smile</i>
<i>without you</i>

1602
01:55:01,561 --> 01:55:05,827
<i>I can't smile without you</i>

1603
01:55:05,899 --> 01:55:07,833
<i>I can't laugh</i>

1604
01:55:07,901 --> 01:55:10,335
<i>- And I can't sing...</i>
<i>- I love you.</i>

1605
01:55:10,403 --> 01:55:14,863
<i>I'm finding it hard</i>
<i>to do anything...</i>

1606
01:55:14,974 --> 01:55:17,306
Grace,
may I accompany you?

1607
01:55:17,377 --> 01:55:19,311
Oh, no, no.

1608
01:55:19,379 --> 01:55:21,108
Yes! Yes!
You've got to do it.

1609
01:55:22,515 --> 01:55:25,712
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>Grace Beasley.</i>

1610
01:55:25,785 --> 01:55:28,117
<i>''Amazing Grace. ''</i>

1611
01:55:31,291 --> 01:55:37,059
<i>You see, I feel sad</i>
<i>when you're sad</i>

1612
01:55:37,130 --> 01:55:42,193
<i>- Oh I feel sad...</i>
<i>- I feel glad when you're glad</i>

1613
01:55:42,268 --> 01:55:44,896
<i>- Oh, I feel glad...</i>
<i>- If you only knew...</i>

1614
01:55:44,971 --> 01:55:48,304
<i>What I'm going through</i>

1615
01:55:48,408 --> 01:55:54,438
<i>I just can't smile without you</i>

1616
01:55:56,482 --> 01:56:01,078
<i>You came along just like a song</i>

1617
01:56:01,154 --> 01:56:03,987
<i>And brightened my day</i>

1618
01:56:04,057 --> 01:56:05,752
<i>Who'd have believed</i>

1619
01:56:05,825 --> 01:56:08,521
<i>- That you were part of a dream?</i>
<i>- Part of a dream...</i>

1620
01:56:08,594 --> 01:56:10,892
<i>- Now it all seems</i>
<i>- Now it all seems...</i>

1621
01:56:10,964 --> 01:56:13,159
<i>- Light-years away</i>
<i>- Light-years away....</i>

1622
01:56:13,232 --> 01:56:19,865
<i>Now you know I can't smile</i>
<i>without you</i>

1623
01:56:19,939 --> 01:56:24,433
<i>I can't smile without you</i>

1624
01:56:24,544 --> 01:56:26,978
<i>I can't laugh</i>

1625
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:29,412
<i>And I can't sing</i>

1626
01:56:29,482 --> 01:56:34,715
<i>I'm finding it hard</i>
<i>to do anything</i>

1627
01:56:34,787 --> 01:56:36,516
<i>Now some people say</i>

1628
01:56:36,589 --> 01:56:39,922
<i>- Happiness takes...</i>
<i>- Go, Mom!</i>

1629
01:56:39,993 --> 01:56:43,258
<i>...so very long to find</i>

1630
01:56:43,329 --> 01:56:45,991
<i>Well,</i>
<i>I'm finding it hard</i>

1631
01:56:46,065 --> 01:56:52,402
<i>- Leaving your love behind me...</i>
<i>- Everybody!</i>

1632
01:56:52,472 --> 01:56:57,239
<i>You see, I can't smile</i>
<i>without you</i>

1633
01:56:57,343 --> 01:57:02,144
<i>I can't smile without you</i>

1634
01:57:02,215 --> 01:57:04,706
<i>I can't laugh</i>

1635
01:57:04,784 --> 01:57:06,752
<i>And I can't sing</i>

1636
01:57:06,819 --> 01:57:09,049
<i>I'm finding it hard</i>

1637
01:57:09,122 --> 01:57:11,147
<i>To do anything</i>

1638
01:57:11,224 --> 01:57:13,124
<i>You see, I feel sad...</i>

1639
01:57:13,192 --> 01:57:16,457
<i>- Can't smile...</i>
<i>- When you're sad</i>

1640
01:57:16,529 --> 01:57:21,057
<i>I feel glad</i>
<i>when you're glad</i>

1641
01:57:21,134 --> 01:57:26,470
<i>If you only knew</i>
<i>what I'm going through</i>

1642
01:57:26,539 --> 01:57:29,440
<i>I just can't smile...</i>

1643
01:57:29,509 --> 01:57:32,171
<i>She just can't smile...</i>

1644
01:57:32,278 --> 01:57:34,212
<i>- She just can't...</i>
<i>- smile...</i>

1645
01:57:34,280 --> 01:57:39,343
<i>Without you.</i>

1646
01:57:39,419 --> 01:57:40,408
<i>Yeah!</i>

1647
01:57:46,392 --> 01:57:47,620
All right.

1648
01:57:47,693 --> 01:57:50,059
How about that?

1649
01:57:51,697 --> 01:57:54,188
Bravo!
