1
00:00:02,249 --> 00:00:04,183
We've been waiting for you
since this morning.

2
00:00:04,384 --> 00:00:05,749
Really?

3
00:00:07,988 --> 00:00:09,979
We're waiting to welcome you
with the flowers for ages...

4
00:00:10,324 --> 00:00:12,087
Honest?
- Absolutely!

5
00:00:16,964 --> 00:00:21,731
All the way here, I had the answer
to your question memorized in my heart.

6
00:00:21,935 --> 00:00:26,065
I didn't know, I wouldn't
need to say a single word.

7
00:00:27,741 --> 00:00:31,643
Both of us have been
tied together in a bond.

8
00:00:32,146 --> 00:00:35,081
Where can you go?

9
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:47,757
Come on, kids.
Have some fresh guavas!

10
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:58,098
You'll find a lot of Rajasthani
color in our attire and speech.

11
00:00:58,906 --> 00:01:03,502
My heart is overjoyed to see you.

12
00:01:04,545 --> 00:01:07,446
What are you explaining to her?

13
00:01:07,714 --> 00:01:10,410
She has lived abroad.

14
00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:13,242
I'm introducing her to the village.

15
00:01:14,621 --> 00:01:19,081
I've heard that people in
the cities are so busy...

16
00:01:19,326 --> 00:01:23,285
They don't have time
to eat meals in peace.

17
00:01:24,765 --> 00:01:28,462
That is why people from cities
come to the village for holidays.

18
00:01:28,835 --> 00:01:31,429
They get peace of mind here.

19
00:01:31,705 --> 00:01:34,868
Grandma, we've left
those lanes far behind.

20
00:01:38,812 --> 00:01:41,804
But excuse me, what's
left in this village?

21
00:01:42,216 --> 00:01:45,083
Neither planes come
here nor mobile phones.

22
00:01:45,419 --> 00:01:47,011
There's a shortage of electricity!

23
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:50,722
We've left the electricity way behind.

24
00:01:52,292 --> 00:01:54,726
We're going for a walk.

25
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,957
Coming.

26
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:01,163
Come on.
- You go ahead.

27
00:02:01,401 --> 00:02:03,961
I'll help the ladies in the kitchen.

28
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:09,134
You too were supposed
to go for the walk.

29
00:02:09,376 --> 00:02:11,776
Who said?
- You said so a while ago.

30
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:14,843
You've reformed...
- No...

31
00:02:15,215 --> 00:02:17,183
Shall we...?

32
00:02:18,085 --> 00:02:19,848
Come on!

33
00:02:21,388 --> 00:02:25,188
Brother! Elder brother!

34
00:02:25,826 --> 00:02:29,091
We came for a walk
but here we're running!

35
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:31,160
Shall we return?
- Just a little further.

36
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:33,524
I want to show Prem how far
the factory has progressed.

37
00:02:34,534 --> 00:02:36,434
Prem, come on.

38
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,331
Come on.

39
00:03:06,366 --> 00:03:07,958
This is the site.

40
00:03:08,135 --> 00:03:10,831
Production will begin in a few months.

41
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:16,741
Can we check the progress of the
factory from close quarters later?

42
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,535
I'm feeling terribly cold!

43
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,145
Okay, we'll sit here for sometime.

44
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:29,113
Won't Papa be terribly happy
when the factory is operational.

45
00:03:30,924 --> 00:03:32,687
What are you thinking of?

46
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:36,761
Nothing.
- I think he's starving.

47
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:40,866
Go for a run. I have to
talk to Prem about something.

48
00:03:41,168 --> 00:03:43,796
Talk to him at home.
After breakfast.

49
00:03:46,173 --> 00:03:51,201
Which way do I go? Not this way
it's all uphill.

50
00:03:53,613 --> 00:03:55,205
What's the matter?

51
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,778
Brother...

52
00:03:58,185 --> 00:04:02,451
When you see poverty and
difficulties around you...

53
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:05,915
Helplessness writ large
on the faces of people.

54
00:04:06,193 --> 00:04:09,219
Don't you then feel...

55
00:04:09,663 --> 00:04:13,622
What is all this for?

56
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:17,868
Sometimes I feel my education,
my Masters Degree...

57
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:22,804
Everything seems futile.

58
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:25,968
We can't run away from the truth.

59
00:04:26,246 --> 00:04:29,841
Will your thinking
diminish somebody's sorrow?

60
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,941
If you want to share their sorrow...

61
00:04:33,387 --> 00:04:37,289
Do something that will
bring joy to their lives.

62
00:04:38,492 --> 00:04:41,893
Look at this plant.
When it is operational...

63
00:04:42,362 --> 00:04:44,887
This place will always have power.

64
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:48,568
This is Papa's dream.
For the progress of this village.

65
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:54,206
For the future of those kids
who will be me and you tomorrow.

66
00:04:58,812 --> 00:05:01,645
You have a lot to do in life.

67
00:05:01,848 --> 00:05:05,807
Study hard. At this point
this is your only duty.

68
00:05:06,186 --> 00:05:09,383
Yes, you do have another duty.

69
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,153
Towards Preeti.

70
00:05:14,161 --> 00:05:17,927
A girl gives up everything for you.

71
00:05:19,132 --> 00:05:21,930
She behaves the way you'd want her to.

72
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,964
In return, she only
asks for a little love.

73
00:05:27,774 --> 00:05:30,242
I know you do lover her a lot.

74
00:05:31,144 --> 00:05:34,910
But you have to express
the love in your heart.

75
00:05:35,549 --> 00:05:37,244
Bring the words in
your heart to your lips.

76
00:05:37,551 --> 00:05:41,885
And you'll see how she blooms.

77
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:50,228
Have you guys finished talking?
- Yes.

78
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:53,622
Anything serious?

79
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:57,202
I'll talk to you when the time comes

80
00:06:01,675 --> 00:06:04,610
You've made excellent
dumplings, sister-in-law!

81
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:09,242
We made them. I had no idea
you could cook so well.

82
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:14,279
Prem, now taste this
and tell us how it is.

83
00:06:14,554 --> 00:06:16,419
No! Please...

84
00:06:16,623 --> 00:06:18,853
What's the matter?

85
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,723
When we insisted, for the first
time, she made Prem's favorite sweet.

86
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:28,197
And she's feeling shy to serve it.

87
00:06:28,535 --> 00:06:30,662
She thinks it's not good enough.

88
00:06:30,971 --> 00:06:34,532
Prem will certify whether
it's good or not. Serve him.

89
00:06:36,376 --> 00:06:38,606
Just a second.

90
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:40,603
The video too is ready.

91
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:54,456
How is it?
- Good.

92
00:06:54,628 --> 00:06:56,289
Good or very good?

93
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,891
Very good.
- Then take some more.

94
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:03,967
I will.
- Here you are!

95
00:07:04,237 --> 00:07:07,104
Brother's face is
as red as the sweet!

96
00:07:14,047 --> 00:07:17,073
I am feeling shy!

97
00:07:17,317 --> 00:07:21,378
Don't be so conscious. I'm
taking your photo with them.

98
00:07:22,222 --> 00:07:24,782
Speak in our tongue.

99
00:07:31,231 --> 00:07:33,961
Prem, put the picnic bags in the bus.

100
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:57,121
The sweet dish was very good.

101
00:07:58,358 --> 00:08:02,226
I was making it for the first time
I feared whether you'd like it.

102
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,534
You must make it again.

103
00:08:44,904 --> 00:08:47,566
Stop riding and come here.

104
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:51,675
We're discussing the love life
of a king who lived 1000 years ago.



1
00:08:55,825 --> 00:08:58,123
Look at that...
- So how many queens did he have?

2
00:08:58,528 --> 00:09:01,429
100. Let's go to the umbrella.

3
00:09:02,498 --> 00:09:05,365
See how lucky he was!

4
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,298
I swear! Had it been me...

5
00:09:16,212 --> 00:09:19,010
And this is the palace of the queens.

6
00:09:19,282 --> 00:09:22,615
They say, the youngest queen
was the most beautiful one!

7
00:09:22,952 --> 00:09:25,819
She's sing in her melodious
voice among her friends.

8
00:09:26,055 --> 00:09:28,353
And dance too.

9
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:34,955
Hearing the sound of their
music and their anklets...

10
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,462
Hundreds of peacocks
would dance here with them.

11
00:09:38,635 --> 00:09:40,466
Do they still come here?

12
00:09:40,703 --> 00:09:42,603
The sky is overcast with clouds.

13
00:09:42,906 --> 00:09:45,466
Beautiful ladies stand before us.

14
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:48,533
How can the poor peacocks escape?

15
00:09:50,046 --> 00:09:51,980
Continue the romance.

16
00:09:54,851 --> 00:09:56,842
Look at that.

17
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,953
What is it? Peacock?
- No, elephants.

18
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,353
Elephant?

19
00:10:07,764 --> 00:10:10,164
Prem is a different kettle of fish.

20
00:10:10,366 --> 00:10:12,095
Sometimes he rides horses.
Otherwise he gets elephants.

21
00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:16,630
Come, I'll take you
for an elephant ride.

22
00:10:22,045 --> 00:10:23,307
Come on, kids.

23
00:10:25,114 --> 00:10:27,844
- Come here sister-in-law.
- I'm going ahead.

24
00:10:28,217 --> 00:10:29,775
Preeti, sit here.

25
00:10:30,186 --> 00:10:33,349
Have fun! Give her a hand.

26
00:10:42,665 --> 00:10:44,132
Everybody be seated.

27
00:10:44,534 --> 00:10:46,502
Sit down.

28
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,464
Where do I go?

29
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:55,678
- Come here.
- Everybody hold hands.

30
00:10:56,112 --> 00:10:59,980
Take me carefully.
I mustn't fall down.

31
00:11:00,183 --> 00:11:01,946
I haven't even got engaged.

32
00:11:04,654 --> 00:11:09,353
My friend, the elephant.
Praise be Lord Ganesha.

33
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:48,863
Look at the peacock!

34
00:11:53,136 --> 00:11:55,661
- Where is it?
- There!

35
00:12:02,311 --> 00:12:04,973
How beautiful!

36
00:12:05,248 --> 00:12:08,775
Yes, truly beautiful!

37
00:12:13,322 --> 00:12:15,882
"My heart..."

38
00:12:16,092 --> 00:12:20,324
"Peacock dance in my heart."

39
00:12:21,964 --> 00:12:27,425
"The black bee screeches
and my heart blooms."

40
00:12:28,004 --> 00:12:32,998
"Has the season changed or the
scenario or simply my perspective?"

41
00:12:33,543 --> 00:12:38,276
"Peacock dance in my heart."

42
00:12:38,948 --> 00:12:44,648
"The black bee screeches
and my heart blooms."

43
00:12:45,088 --> 00:12:52,392
"Has the season changed or
the scenario or my perspective?"

44
00:13:36,205 --> 00:13:53,021
"You are a newly wed bride.
You reflect radiant love."

45
00:13:53,356 --> 00:13:59,090
"Henna on your hands and kohl in
eyes brings a sparkle to my life."

46
00:13:59,662 --> 00:14:04,065
"You came as the answer
to my questions, my love."

47
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:12,569
"Peacocks dance in my heart."

48
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:18,677
"We're tied in such a bond
I've madly fallen in love."

49
00:14:19,215 --> 00:14:25,552
"Has the season changed or the
scenario or simply my perspective?"

50
00:15:22,245 --> 00:15:38,651
"The season of love is here.
It has sprung love everywhere."

51
00:15:39,195 --> 00:15:44,997
"The secret that was in my heart
has finally come to my lips."

52
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:50,532
"I'll install you in my heart and
take you to the kingdom of love."

53
00:15:50,806 --> 00:15:58,235
"Peacocks dance in my heart."

54
00:15:59,115 --> 00:16:04,849
"Take me wherever you please,
I'll follow you, my dearest."

55
00:16:05,154 --> 00:16:10,990
"Has the season changed or the
scenario or simply my perspective?

56
00:17:30,773 --> 00:17:47,316
"The procession of the moon and
stars brought this glorious moment."

57
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:53,285
"What a great moment!
The queen of my dreams is with me."

58
00:17:53,896 --> 00:17:59,732
"You troubled me so much.
Today I won't let go your arm."

59
00:18:25,194 --> 00:18:27,128
The moon light night is beautiful!

60
00:18:27,396 --> 00:18:30,695
It's bright outside. Only
we don't have current.

61
00:18:31,033 --> 00:18:33,160
How can that be?

62
00:18:33,869 --> 00:18:35,268
I'll take a look.

63
00:19:42,471 --> 00:19:43,733
The current is back?

64
00:19:43,906 --> 00:19:45,430
What do you think?

65
00:19:47,476 --> 00:19:50,274
I'll just be back.

66
00:20:11,634 --> 00:20:13,727
Welcome!

67
00:20:17,973 --> 00:20:21,841
My dear fellow, congratulations
on your daughter's engagement.

68
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:27,982
What are you doing?

69
00:20:28,717 --> 00:20:32,551
We've come to ask you
for your child's hand.

70
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,288
Mummy and Papa are here.

71
00:20:37,593 --> 00:20:40,027
- They're asking for you.
- I won't go!

72
00:20:40,195 --> 00:20:43,426
Strange! You're getting
engaged today and look at you.

73
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:46,533
Tease me, go on.

74
00:20:46,902 --> 00:20:50,998
You're the one who spread
the tale of the fuse off!

75
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,035
Everyone is laughing!

76
00:20:54,944 --> 00:20:56,639
What will Mummy and Papa think?

77
00:20:56,979 --> 00:21:01,473
Mummy was really mad at you. Said
nobody in the family behaved like you!

78
00:21:02,151 --> 00:21:03,345
I'm dead!

79
00:21:04,486 --> 00:21:07,421
- I'll say it was your ideal.
- Want to kill me?

80
00:21:09,658 --> 00:21:12,718
Tell them the light
went off by chance.

81
00:21:14,997 --> 00:21:17,898
Please, my Moms!

82
00:21:19,201 --> 00:21:20,998
Come on.

83
00:21:22,638 --> 00:21:24,401
Good Lord!

84
00:21:36,585 --> 00:21:40,954
- The light went off by chance.
- Really? - It wasn't my fault.

85
00:21:41,624 --> 00:21:43,182
Isn't it?

86
00:21:45,461 --> 00:21:47,986
Brother and his wife are to be blamed.

87
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:51,165
They said, get engaged.
So I said, all right.

88
00:21:51,767 --> 00:21:53,997
- It finishes one job.
- Oh, I see.

89
00:21:55,904 --> 00:21:57,201
Come on, Mummy.

90
00:22:04,413 --> 00:22:07,541
"Mother Yashodha..."

91
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:11,318
"This son of yours..."

92
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:20,451
"Mother Yashodha, this son of yours..."

93
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:24,595
"Holds my arms at the riverbank."

94
00:22:24,867 --> 00:22:28,701
"He troubles me a lot,
keeps fighting with me."

95
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:41,643
"I was spared thanks to Lord Rama."

96
00:22:43,185 --> 00:22:47,246
"Mother Yoshodha, this son of yours..."

97
00:22:47,589 --> 00:22:50,922
"holds my arms at the river bank."

98
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,390
"He troubles me a lot,
he keeps fighting with me."

99
00:22:57,099 --> 00:23:08,533
"I was spared thanks to Lord Rama."

100
00:23:42,745 --> 00:23:49,150
"In the streets of Gokul,
on the banks of the Jamuna."

101
00:23:49,384 --> 00:23:54,515
"He shyly throws pebbles at me."

102
00:23:57,059 --> 00:24:02,827
"He's so mischievous but
his countenance innocent."

103
00:24:03,098 --> 00:24:08,798
"He drenches my blouse
when Holi comes by."

104
00:24:09,705 --> 00:24:12,538
"He won't leave my arm."

105
00:24:13,075 --> 00:24:16,511
"He twists my wrists."

106
00:24:17,312 --> 00:24:18,836
"He won't leave my arm."

107
00:24:19,081 --> 00:24:21,311
"He twists my wrists."

108
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:25,179
"I fall at his feet yet
he won't leave me in peace."

109
00:24:25,621 --> 00:24:29,022
"He traps me with his sweet words."

110
00:25:20,909 --> 00:25:26,643
"Each time Mohan plays the flute..."

111
00:25:27,182 --> 00:25:32,484
"My anklets start to
dance on their own."

112
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:40,393
"When he teases me with his eyes..."

113
00:25:41,196 --> 00:25:46,793
"The damsel foolishly in love
holds on to heart for dear life."

114
00:25:47,469 --> 00:25:50,597
"She has lost her heart."

115
00:25:51,473 --> 00:25:55,341
"She has lost her sleep."

116
00:25:55,944 --> 00:25:57,377
"She has lost her heart."

117
00:25:57,613 --> 00:25:59,478
"She has lost her sleep."

118
00:25:59,715 --> 00:26:03,583
"She couldn't do what
she set out to do."

119
00:26:03,886 --> 00:26:08,289
"With great difficulty,
she controlled her heart."

120
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:20,767
"Thanks to Lord Rama"

121
00:27:03,312 --> 00:27:08,249
"The Kanha of Gokul
lives in every heart."

122
00:27:09,351 --> 00:27:14,186
"Fortunate am I that I found him."

123
00:27:17,492 --> 00:27:23,089
"Agreed that he belongs to all."

124
00:27:23,632 --> 00:27:29,161
"Yet he will always be yours, mother."

125
00:27:29,838 --> 00:27:33,171
"He's a beloved."

126
00:27:33,742 --> 00:27:37,405
"You've given him to us."

127
00:27:37,913 --> 00:27:39,312
"He's a beloved."

128
00:27:39,581 --> 00:27:41,708
"You've given him to us."

129
00:27:41,984 --> 00:27:45,886
"You've taken us into your
shield of maternal love."

130
00:27:46,221 --> 00:27:50,487
"Oh mother, we have
to live at your feet."

131
00:27:51,593 --> 00:28:03,596
"Thanks to Lord Rama's kindness."

132
00:28:19,021 --> 00:28:20,249
Come here.

133
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:23,723
Why are you sitting there
with the old guys? Come here.

134
00:28:25,327 --> 00:28:27,090
Only waiting for you.

135
00:28:46,281 --> 00:28:49,580
You will first hava a son
followed by a daughter.

136
00:28:52,521 --> 00:28:53,920
What formula is this?

137
00:28:54,189 --> 00:28:56,851
It's simple. If the ring is
straight, it will be a son.

138
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:58,683
If it spins, it will be a girl.

139
00:28:58,927 --> 00:29:01,191
And if it doesn't spin, full stop.

140
00:29:02,197 --> 00:29:04,597
What a scientific method!

141
00:29:05,033 --> 00:29:09,663
He's fond of reading from various
sources and using it to impress.

142
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:13,439
Man should view every new
thing with curiosity.

143
00:29:14,142 --> 00:29:15,609
And it was true in our case.

144
00:29:17,145 --> 00:29:19,113
Preeti, now it's your turn.

145
00:29:19,948 --> 00:29:21,540
Come on, show your hand.

146
00:29:21,783 --> 00:29:23,774
Now everybody is interested.

147
00:29:33,161 --> 00:29:37,461
You'll just have a
sweet little boy. Happy?

148
00:29:48,143 --> 00:29:51,601
Yes, now it's your turn.

149
00:29:57,252 --> 00:29:59,277
Son...

150
00:30:01,523 --> 00:30:04,287
Daughter.

151
00:30:06,261 --> 00:30:09,230
Son. Daughter.

152
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:12,030
Son. Daughter.

153
00:30:12,801 --> 00:30:17,261
Son. Daughter.
Son. Daughter...

154
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:23,106
I've had it!

155
00:30:23,845 --> 00:30:26,439
I was pulling your leg.

156
00:30:55,944 --> 00:30:58,276
- Give me your hand.
- I won't.

157
00:30:58,413 --> 00:31:01,211
- Why? - What's this?
Do you have to return today?

158
00:31:01,383 --> 00:31:06,616
What has cropped up that
Anurag has called you today?

159
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:11,591
It must be important or
brother wouldn't have called.

160
00:31:12,093 --> 00:31:15,529
Today we were planning a
picnic to the factory site.

161
00:31:15,797 --> 00:31:17,765
We won't enjoy without the kids.

162
00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:22,402
We'll plan another trip after
Prem and Vinod get married.

163
00:31:22,704 --> 00:31:24,228
Papa, we'll all go together.

164
00:31:24,439 --> 00:31:28,102
By then the seat next
to your should be full.

165
00:31:29,177 --> 00:31:32,943
I've fixed my program
with sister-in-law.

166
00:31:33,281 --> 00:31:37,377
When they will be three,
we will be two.

167
00:31:39,721 --> 00:31:41,655
We'll take leave.

168
00:31:42,624 --> 00:31:44,148
It's time.

169
00:31:53,235 --> 00:31:57,638
We didn't realize how these days
flew by in games and laughter.

170
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:10,741
30 years ago, I left
this village with a dream.

171
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:15,386
I wanted to do something so that
the villagers wouldn't have to...

172
00:32:15,857 --> 00:32:20,453
...leave their families
and go far for work.

173
00:32:21,096 --> 00:32:24,190
Today I see that dream taking shape.

174
00:32:25,834 --> 00:32:29,497
Brother and Bhaijaan are waiting
for us at the site. We'll go there.

175
00:32:32,374 --> 00:32:37,778
- Let's go to work.
- Shall we stay here?

176
00:32:46,087 --> 00:32:49,420
We're all waiting for the
factory to be inaugurated.

177
00:32:49,724 --> 00:32:54,423
The moment the plant is inaugurated
we'll hear the wedding bells.

178
00:32:54,729 --> 00:32:57,493
The date for the wedding
matches this perfectly.

179
00:32:58,867 --> 00:33:01,893
Now we're just waiting
for that auspicious date.

180
00:33:02,203 --> 00:33:05,764
And I hand over the business
to my sons and be carefree.

181
00:33:06,241 --> 00:33:15,445
I've decided to hand charge of the
company, the directorship to Vivek.

182
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,214
I'd made her a promise.

183
00:33:19,721 --> 00:33:24,715
Once our sons are married,
all my time will be hers.

184
00:33:25,193 --> 00:33:28,185
So the daily appointments
dairy will be with her?

185
00:33:29,164 --> 00:33:32,429
You will be burdening Vivek
with a huge responsibility.

186
00:33:32,801 --> 00:33:35,634
He deserves it every way.

187
00:33:37,906 --> 00:33:40,568
Wow! What news!

188
00:33:40,942 --> 00:33:42,534
Congratulations!

189
00:33:42,877 --> 00:33:45,368
You don't understand anything.!

190
00:33:45,747 --> 00:33:48,511
If Vivek becomes the
company managing director...

191
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,651
Adarsh will be one up on us!

192
00:33:52,187 --> 00:33:56,021
- That is true.
- What will our son-in-law have?

193
00:33:56,458 --> 00:33:59,450
They will always have to obey Vivek.

194
00:33:59,928 --> 00:34:03,489
They will have to beg
him for every little thing!

195
00:34:03,898 --> 00:34:06,458
What shame in asking
your elder brother?

196
00:34:07,001 --> 00:34:13,133
Power can corrupt. Family
relations are forgotten.

197
00:34:13,908 --> 00:34:16,741
This concerns our daughters too.

198
00:34:17,512 --> 00:34:20,447
You are very good friends.

199
00:34:20,849 --> 00:34:22,976
Do something and stop
this from happening.

200
00:34:24,085 --> 00:34:26,485
Take the wife into confidence.

201
00:34:26,755 --> 00:34:30,156
- Why? - The minds of women
work better in this regard.

202
00:34:30,492 --> 00:34:32,960
Don't worry. Follow me.

203
00:34:33,428 --> 00:34:39,663
We don't understand your
making Vivek the MD.

204
00:34:40,201 --> 00:34:42,601
- Why?
- Is that fair to us?

205
00:34:44,038 --> 00:34:45,665
With Vinod and Prem?

206
00:34:46,074 --> 00:34:48,065
Such an important announcement
and you simply said it.

207
00:34:48,343 --> 00:34:50,004
No party, no celebration.

208
00:34:54,783 --> 00:34:57,843
Dharmraj is most upset about this.

209
00:34:58,453 --> 00:35:01,650
That is why he has decided that
tomorrow before we leave for town...

210
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:06,156
He will distribute Jaipur
sweetmeats to the village!

211
00:35:06,461 --> 00:35:08,156
Why did you have to do this?

212
00:35:18,506 --> 00:35:21,031
May the Lord always be kind to you.

213
00:35:22,177 --> 00:35:25,476
My good fellow, everybody
is blessing you for this!

214
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:31,348
All of you are leaving.

215
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:33,983
We will be left alone.

216
00:35:34,255 --> 00:35:36,849
That is why we leave Sapna with you.

217
00:35:37,258 --> 00:35:40,022
Or we'd take her along.

218
00:35:40,695 --> 00:35:43,186
Next time, I'll bring him along.

219
00:35:43,465 --> 00:35:45,729
He'll stay here for a few
days to learn the work.

220
00:35:46,067 --> 00:35:49,628
I'll come here to work
but not make small talk.

221
00:35:50,371 --> 00:35:52,236
If I get the time...

222
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,642
When do you leave for
your studies abroad?

223
00:35:57,912 --> 00:35:59,709
Tomorrow night.

224
00:36:08,957 --> 00:36:12,393
Here are the sweets and savories.
Keep them in the bag.

225
00:36:16,831 --> 00:36:18,890
I didn't make them.

226
00:36:21,069 --> 00:36:23,060
Did you...?

227
00:36:27,408 --> 00:36:31,367
Preeti made them. Don't you dare
distribute them amongest friends!

228
00:36:33,515 --> 00:36:34,880
When will you return?

229
00:36:36,084 --> 00:36:38,109
How can I say?

230
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,351
Only till the exams.

231
00:36:40,555 --> 00:36:42,147
Then he'll be with you.

232
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:47,527
Write a love letter to mother
everyday instead of to Preeti.

233
00:36:47,929 --> 00:36:50,727
- You spoke again!
- The flight is on time. Hurry up.

234
00:36:51,466 --> 00:36:54,333
You come here, I'll show you!

235
00:36:58,706 --> 00:37:01,266
Shall we leave?

236
00:37:08,716 --> 00:37:10,980
You may stay.

237
00:37:22,897 --> 00:37:24,865
This is very good.

238
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:28,431
Going on a world trip with your wife.

239
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,366
You'll have Prem's
company on the flight.

240
00:37:31,573 --> 00:37:34,201
You're keeping the promise
you gave your wife.

241
00:37:34,475 --> 00:37:36,534
And I'm keeping mine.

242
00:37:39,447 --> 00:37:43,281
Leave this veil behind for some days.

243
00:37:43,685 --> 00:37:46,552
She'll wear jeans abroad.

244
00:38:06,541 --> 00:38:10,705
Come here. Sit with Papa today.

245
00:38:13,181 --> 00:38:15,877
I had to make an important phone call.

246
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:21,415
Try to understand the important
phone call after engagement!

247
00:38:22,724 --> 00:38:25,124
This will be a daily occurrence.

248
00:38:25,793 --> 00:38:29,024
Did you decide the
color for your room?

249
00:38:31,065 --> 00:38:33,829
Prem, let us know your choice too.

250
00:38:34,035 --> 00:38:36,595
I have to make rooms for both
of you before your marriages.

251
00:38:36,871 --> 00:38:40,272
Vinod has given me a long list.
You too must tell me.

252
00:38:41,209 --> 00:38:44,474
What can I say? As Preeti wishes.

253
00:38:44,912 --> 00:38:48,848
He has really changed.

254
00:38:49,317 --> 00:38:54,016
I'll just say this. All three boys
should have similar rooms.

255
00:38:54,455 --> 00:38:58,983
They are the same. Vivek's is up
stairs and Prem and Vinod are down.

256
00:38:59,227 --> 00:39:00,888
They too should have rooms upstairs.

257
00:39:01,129 --> 00:39:02,756
Why shouldn't they get a garden view?

258
00:39:03,031 --> 00:39:09,129
Later these are the issues that
will create fights between them.

259
00:39:13,374 --> 00:39:16,104
She's laughing.

260
00:39:17,278 --> 00:39:21,044
- Uncle is here.
- Good day to you.

261
00:39:21,282 --> 00:39:23,375
Welcome.

262
00:39:23,918 --> 00:39:25,715
Since when do you have this ailment?

263
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:30,480
Excuse me, I think I'm
going through a bad phase.

264
00:39:30,658 --> 00:39:32,717
Get them in.

265
00:39:33,161 --> 00:39:36,528
I've brought some sweets
for Janmashtami, from Agra.

266
00:39:36,731 --> 00:39:38,665
Pass them here!

267
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,562
You are our favorite
relative from all the three!

268
00:39:46,407 --> 00:39:49,035
Call Papa in the office
and tell him brother is here.

269
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:51,574
Don't disturb him in work.

270
00:39:51,779 --> 00:39:55,840
I've come to meet sister.

271
00:39:58,753 --> 00:40:00,812
First of all do something for us.

272
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:10,060
What can I say in family matters?

273
00:40:10,298 --> 00:40:12,198
You have all the rights.

274
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,267
- You're giving your daughter!
- Yes. That's right.

275
00:40:15,503 --> 00:40:17,994
You get after every little thing!

276
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:23,442
Excuse me.

277
00:40:29,117 --> 00:40:31,915
Sangita here.

278
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,251
I've been thinking
of you since morning.

279
00:40:34,522 --> 00:40:37,923
- How are the kids?
- All fine.

280
00:40:40,194 --> 00:40:42,458
Are you feeling all right?

281
00:40:42,697 --> 00:40:46,656
- Yes, is Vivek home?
- He's in the office.

282
00:40:46,901 --> 00:40:49,802
I'll talk to him there.

283
00:40:50,238 --> 00:40:54,732
Nothing special. Bye.

284
00:41:01,482 --> 00:41:06,977
Don't worry. Give the line to Anand.

285
00:41:08,356 --> 00:41:13,885
Something important cropped up.
We'll discuss this later.

286
00:41:17,265 --> 00:41:23,033
I don't know what exactly happened
between Anand and Anurag.

287
00:41:23,738 --> 00:41:27,572
But Sangita and Anand
are quite worried.

288
00:41:28,676 --> 00:41:30,644
They have called me there.

289
00:41:45,526 --> 00:41:48,393
Why are you crying?

290
00:41:49,864 --> 00:41:51,593
What's the matter?

291
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:56,861
You are aware that we have
been a tight knit family.

292
00:41:57,205 --> 00:42:02,165
Brother Anurag, Jyoti,
Sangita, me and the three kids.

293
00:42:02,443 --> 00:42:05,935
We've had no ill feelings.

294
00:42:06,214 --> 00:42:09,672
Since Anurag called us from Rampur...

295
00:42:09,951 --> 00:42:13,682
He seemed changed.

296
00:42:14,088 --> 00:42:17,353
I thought it was tension of work.

297
00:42:17,758 --> 00:42:20,750
But yesterday he called us and said...

298
00:42:21,128 --> 00:42:23,926
We must look for a separate business.

299
00:42:24,165 --> 00:42:25,894
A separate home.

300
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:30,196
Anurag said that? I can't believe it.

301
00:42:30,371 --> 00:42:32,168
It is true.

302
00:42:32,373 --> 00:42:36,776
After doing computer engineering
my work has been technical.

303
00:42:37,245 --> 00:42:40,942
Brother looked after the
company accounts and finances.

304
00:42:41,282 --> 00:42:44,877
When he transfered the company
property and shares to his name...

305
00:42:45,152 --> 00:42:47,382
We didn't realize it.

306
00:42:47,555 --> 00:42:51,514
Tell me, did your father make a will?

307
00:42:51,692 --> 00:42:54,126
- No, Uncle.
- Then forgive me...

308
00:42:54,395 --> 00:42:58,923
Your brother has no legal
right to grab everything!

309
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:01,964
We can go to court and
stake a claim in everything!

310
00:43:02,136 --> 00:43:04,229
You will get your right!

311
00:43:04,472 --> 00:43:06,337
- No, Uncle.
- No?

312
00:43:06,574 --> 00:43:10,237
The work that father started
with such love and efforts...

313
00:43:10,544 --> 00:43:15,277
I don't want to drag it to court.

314
00:43:15,816 --> 00:43:19,252
And then how can I fight my brother?

315
00:43:19,487 --> 00:43:22,115
This concerns your life.

316
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:24,622
Life can be started again.

317
00:43:24,959 --> 00:43:27,553
We thought we'd shift to Banglore.

318
00:43:27,828 --> 00:43:29,819
It has a growing computer industry.

319
00:43:30,097 --> 00:43:34,329
I have friends there.
I'll begin a new project.

320
00:43:34,568 --> 00:43:38,095
That's not so simple.

321
00:43:38,439 --> 00:43:43,399
And you have the responsibility
of Sangita and Radhika.

322
00:43:45,446 --> 00:43:49,940
That's the only thought
that makes me nervous.

323
00:43:50,418 --> 00:43:53,615
Then I called Vivek.

324
00:43:53,955 --> 00:43:56,651
When he was in agreement
with my decision...

325
00:43:56,991 --> 00:44:00,119
I took Anurag's blessings and left.

326
00:44:00,361 --> 00:44:04,161
Did we take the right decision?

327
00:44:11,439 --> 00:44:15,671
We're all proud of you.

328
00:44:18,746 --> 00:44:20,839
The only sad part is...

329
00:44:21,082 --> 00:44:25,610
The family is broken.

330
00:44:25,853 --> 00:44:30,756
They will be one again.

331
00:44:32,493 --> 00:44:34,586
Absolutely.

332
00:44:36,497 --> 00:44:39,466
Come here, baby.

333
00:44:40,835 --> 00:44:44,236
Come to me, child.

334
00:44:49,944 --> 00:44:52,538
I'm very worried.

335
00:44:52,813 --> 00:44:58,115
How will Anand establish
his work alone in a new city?

336
00:44:58,352 --> 00:45:02,550
There's no need to worry.
I just spoke to Mr. Richard.

337
00:45:02,857 --> 00:45:05,826
He's our agent in London
who also deals in computers.

338
00:45:06,193 --> 00:45:10,823
He wants Anand to join him and
look after the South India business.

339
00:45:12,566 --> 00:45:15,433
And there's no problem
about accomodatiion there.

340
00:45:15,736 --> 00:45:18,136
I have a flat there.
Sangita can be comfortable.

341
00:45:18,606 --> 00:45:21,370
Vinod and I will leave
for Banglore today itself.

342
00:45:21,609 --> 00:45:24,908
We'll return only after settling them.

343
00:45:27,081 --> 00:45:31,984
Consider these
difficult times a test.

344
00:45:32,286 --> 00:45:36,746
You'll see there's some
good hidden in this too.

345
00:45:37,792 --> 00:45:39,953
- Take this, my dear.
- May I take two more?

346
00:45:40,194 --> 00:45:42,128
Sure. Here.

347
00:45:42,496 --> 00:45:44,987
One for Raju and
the other for Bablu.

348
00:45:45,266 --> 00:45:47,996
I'll give it when we meet.

349
00:45:53,274 --> 00:45:57,301
Radhika will miss
Raju and Bablu a lot.

350
00:46:02,817 --> 00:46:04,250
Shall we leave?

351
00:46:04,585 --> 00:46:06,450
Yes brother.

352
00:46:07,855 --> 00:46:09,789
See you Mummy.

353
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:14,725
Take care dear.

354
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:39,909
"In happy times or sad..."

355
00:46:40,221 --> 00:46:47,957
"They who come to the Lord's
refuge face no obstacles."

356
00:46:48,195 --> 00:46:55,897
"Time and religion may fail you."

357
00:46:56,303 --> 00:47:03,209
"Surrender yourself at the
Lord's feet and gain solace."

358
00:47:09,383 --> 00:47:18,917
"Mother don't let your mind
get poisoned by unfortunate."

359
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:22,351
I'm very worried.

360
00:47:25,032 --> 00:47:29,628
What happened to Anand
shouldn't happen to us.

361
00:47:33,807 --> 00:47:36,605
I don't understand...

362
00:47:37,011 --> 00:47:40,947
I've come here from Rampur
only to explain this to you!

363
00:47:41,382 --> 00:47:45,978
Ram Kishen is appointing Vivek
the Managing Director. That's good.

364
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:51,255
But in the future if there's a
misunderstanding between the brother?

365
00:47:52,359 --> 00:47:57,353
What he means is, getting charge of
the business like Anurag if Vivek...

366
00:47:57,598 --> 00:48:00,863
...blesses Vinod and Prem and
sends them out of the house.

367
00:48:01,135 --> 00:48:04,332
Vivek loves his brothers
more than his own self!

368
00:48:04,572 --> 00:48:09,100
Excuse me but the most loving
man changes on getting power.

369
00:48:10,444 --> 00:48:14,073
You sang praise of Anurag.
What happened?

370
00:48:14,548 --> 00:48:20,453
Truthfully speaking, I couldn't
bear to see Sangita's sad face.

371
00:48:20,721 --> 00:48:22,518
The thought brings tears to my eyes!

372
00:48:22,756 --> 00:48:25,953
The ones whose children
played in Sangita's lap...

373
00:48:26,193 --> 00:48:28,957
Played with Mumu... They did this!

374
00:48:29,296 --> 00:48:30,854
With the real brother!

375
00:48:31,098 --> 00:48:37,094
If a real brother could do this,
don't forget Vivek is a step brother!

376
00:48:37,238 --> 00:48:40,571
You can't deny the truth.

377
00:48:42,376 --> 00:48:46,278
Yes, today Anand is
facing such problems.

378
00:48:46,513 --> 00:48:50,916
He called Vivek to advise him
about what to do.

379
00:48:51,185 --> 00:48:53,449
And what did Vivek do?

380
00:48:53,721 --> 00:48:56,884
Tell me the truth, if he really
had the heart of a brother...

381
00:48:57,124 --> 00:48:59,558
Would he leave his sister mid stream?

382
00:48:59,827 --> 00:49:02,387
He would fight, do anything!
He'd get her her rights!

383
00:49:02,563 --> 00:49:06,522
He wouldn't wash his hands
off his sister's responsibility.

384
00:49:10,571 --> 00:49:13,597
You and your husband are very generous.

385
00:49:14,508 --> 00:49:18,000
You bore your daughter's
sorrows with a smile.

386
00:49:18,279 --> 00:49:20,770
But if this same thing
happens to Prem or Vinod...

387
00:49:21,115 --> 00:49:26,519
Pritam and I won't be
able to bear this sorrow.

388
00:49:26,854 --> 00:49:30,585
We've given our daughters to you.

389
00:49:30,824 --> 00:49:34,282
Now their joys and good
fortune lie in your hands.

390
00:49:34,528 --> 00:49:37,088
What are you doing?

391
00:49:37,331 --> 00:49:41,062
Vinod will fight and have his way.

392
00:49:41,368 --> 00:49:44,929
But what about Prem?
Don't we all know him?

393
00:49:45,272 --> 00:49:48,070
He's way apart from worldliness.

394
00:49:48,342 --> 00:49:53,006
At least think of him.

395
00:49:56,150 --> 00:50:00,610
Your husband's dream is great.

396
00:50:00,921 --> 00:50:03,321
The entire family
lives together happily!

397
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:05,353
But is it possible?

398
00:50:05,626 --> 00:50:07,924
Can two brides live
together without fighting?

399
00:50:08,162 --> 00:50:11,029
- Show me one house.
- Don't forget...

400
00:50:11,298 --> 00:50:14,495
The man who runs the office,
his wife rules the home.

401
00:50:14,735 --> 00:50:17,203
In the future if Sadhna doesn't
make Preeti and Sapna...

402
00:50:17,371 --> 00:50:19,771
dance to her tune...
I'll eat my words.

403
00:50:20,007 --> 00:50:24,637
In your shoes I would never hand
the family to Vivek and Sadhna!

404
00:50:24,945 --> 00:50:28,472
The truth is however much
you may love Vivek and Sadhna...

405
00:50:28,716 --> 00:50:30,479
He is not your own!

406
00:50:30,684 --> 00:50:33,175
He is not your blood!

407
00:51:46,427 --> 00:51:49,885
Yes Sangita, is
everything settled there?

408
00:51:50,264 --> 00:51:54,064
I see, Anandbabu has gone
to the office with Vivek?

409
00:51:54,334 --> 00:51:57,861
And what is little Radhika doing?

410
00:51:58,038 --> 00:52:00,905
She's having breakfast.
Here, talk to her.

411
00:52:01,208 --> 00:52:04,268
Grandpa, I'm drinking milk by myself.

412
00:52:04,945 --> 00:52:08,210
I too am drinking milk.

413
00:52:12,252 --> 00:52:17,087
- How did you land there?
- For goodies made by my daughter.

414
00:52:17,591 --> 00:52:20,788
In fact, I suggest you
come here with your wife.

415
00:52:21,562 --> 00:52:24,690
I'll talk to her.

416
00:52:25,032 --> 00:52:26,897
Talk to him.

417
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:30,035
Vivek and I will return by evening.

418
00:52:32,072 --> 00:52:34,870
Finally, the daughter is happy.

419
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:39,711
Mummy hasn't eaten a
thing since last night.

420
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:41,971
She seems very worried.

421
00:52:42,216 --> 00:52:47,381
Send her breakfast upstairs.
I'll talk to her.

422
00:52:53,193 --> 00:52:56,890
I just spoke to Sangita.
She is happy.

423
00:52:57,097 --> 00:52:59,429
No need to worry.

424
00:52:59,666 --> 00:53:03,397
Let's go to her for some days.

425
00:53:03,704 --> 00:53:05,968
She will appreciate it.

426
00:53:08,942 --> 00:53:13,902
What's the matter?
Some other worry?

427
00:53:14,982 --> 00:53:21,387
I don't want Prem and Vinod to
go through Anand's experience.

428
00:53:22,089 --> 00:53:24,250
What do you mean?

429
00:53:27,628 --> 00:53:31,325
Why are you appointing
Vivek the Managing Director?

430
00:53:31,532 --> 00:53:34,933
Is that all?

431
00:53:35,335 --> 00:53:38,896
Can Vivek ever treat
his brothers in this way?

432
00:53:39,373 --> 00:53:41,204
Ask your own heart.

433
00:53:41,475 --> 00:53:43,739
You know him better than I do.

434
00:53:43,977 --> 00:53:47,913
I know that this family has 3 sons.

435
00:53:48,549 --> 00:53:54,419
Instead of giving everything to one
divide everything between them.

436
00:53:55,122 --> 00:53:56,783
What are you saying?

437
00:53:57,024 --> 00:54:00,619
It's not too late.
It will be done with love.

438
00:54:01,428 --> 00:54:06,331
And I want it done before
Prem and Vinod get married.

439
00:54:06,733 --> 00:54:09,361
Do you know what you're saying?

440
00:54:09,703 --> 00:54:14,333
Split them up? Separate
Vivek, Prem and Vinod?

441
00:54:14,775 --> 00:54:17,005
These children are our dreams!

442
00:54:17,244 --> 00:54:21,305
- You want to break them up?
- What dreams are you talking of?

443
00:54:21,882 --> 00:54:26,046
Our daughter has been
thrown out of her own home!

444
00:54:30,157 --> 00:54:33,684
Haven't we experienced
highs and lows in life?

445
00:54:33,961 --> 00:54:36,361
Why are you becoming weak today?

446
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:40,259
This is the time we must stay close
and give strength to our daughter.

447
00:54:40,467 --> 00:54:43,163
I don't want to argue with you.

448
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:45,595
For the first time
I'm asking you for something.

449
00:54:45,872 --> 00:54:48,204
And I want it.

450
00:54:48,408 --> 00:54:55,541
What you want, you're
asking for... is wrong!

451
00:55:20,574 --> 00:55:25,068
- Breakfast.
- I'm not hungry.

452
00:55:57,210 --> 00:55:59,144
Mother.

453
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:14,756
I know you are very upset at
what happened with Anand and Sangita.

454
00:56:15,395 --> 00:56:19,889
Your thinking that this shouldn't
happen in our family too is right.

455
00:56:20,734 --> 00:56:24,363
But if we split up like this...

456
00:56:24,671 --> 00:56:26,662
If this house is broken into three...

457
00:56:26,907 --> 00:56:29,876
Will we be happy?

458
00:56:31,445 --> 00:56:35,779
Think about it. When
Sangita comes for rakhi...

459
00:56:36,016 --> 00:56:39,782
To which brother's house
will she go first?

460
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:43,180
And we still have to
make Vinod's career.

461
00:56:43,423 --> 00:56:49,487
His innocence will be stifled
in the division of business.

462
00:56:49,863 --> 00:56:54,630
Don't punish everybody for me.

463
00:56:54,835 --> 00:56:57,565
Don't break everyone up.

464
00:56:57,838 --> 00:57:02,104
I don't want to be
the Managing Director.

465
00:57:02,342 --> 00:57:04,207
Sadhna and I will go to Rampur.

466
00:57:04,444 --> 00:57:06,878
The new plant has to be looked after.

467
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:09,148
We'll stay there.

468
00:57:09,349 --> 00:57:13,445
I'll tell Papa to make
Prem the Managing Director.

469
00:57:18,759 --> 00:57:25,096
I assure you that Prem and Vinod
will never suffer as long as I live.

470
00:57:27,768 --> 00:57:30,168
Sadhna has brought you dinner.

471
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:33,237
Eat a little. For our sake.

472
00:57:43,216 --> 00:57:45,810
Come on, mother.

473
00:57:52,092 --> 00:57:55,289
What are you saying?
Both of you will go to Rampur!

474
00:57:55,562 --> 00:57:57,086
Yes, Vinod.

475
00:57:57,297 --> 00:58:00,095
What's wrong with it?

476
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,866
Prem will look after everything here.

477
00:58:03,069 --> 00:58:06,129
And Rampur is not far
Just a few hours away.

478
00:58:07,307 --> 00:58:11,971
All right then. If you
have decided to go...

479
00:58:12,112 --> 00:58:15,138
And Mummy is happy about it...

480
00:58:15,348 --> 00:58:18,317
Then I too will go with you!

481
00:58:18,585 --> 00:58:21,611
- No Vinod.
- Nobody will go anywhere!

482
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:25,454
Nobody will go anywhere.

483
00:58:26,593 --> 00:58:28,390
May I come in, sir?

484
00:58:28,528 --> 00:58:30,325
Yes, come in.

485
00:58:31,431 --> 00:58:32,898
Have you brought all the papers?

486
00:58:41,775 --> 00:58:44,403
Give it another thought.

487
00:58:45,345 --> 00:58:47,370
No, Khan.

488
00:58:48,181 --> 00:58:51,446
The time for seperation is here.

489
00:58:51,651 --> 00:58:56,179
Sadhna and I are leaving
for Rampur today.

490
00:58:56,389 --> 00:58:59,381
You won't go anywhere!

491
00:59:00,126 --> 00:59:03,425
I've given my word to mother.

492
00:59:10,804 --> 00:59:13,170
Mother, we're leaving.

493
00:59:13,373 --> 00:59:18,902
Vinod insists of coming along.
I'll send him back soon.

494
00:59:20,413 --> 00:59:23,007
I'd also like to say this...

495
00:59:23,183 --> 00:59:26,175
Why this is happening?
The reason behind it...

496
00:59:26,353 --> 00:59:29,720
People will ask us. Don't
keep a load on your heart.

497
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:34,327
No mother will wish ill for her son.

498
01:00:08,695 --> 01:00:10,663
Forgive me, father.

499
01:00:11,531 --> 01:00:13,761
I hurt you.

500
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:19,495
Silly boy. Do the words
of a son hurt a father?

501
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:27,642
You are going. Go.
I won't stop you.

502
01:00:29,916 --> 01:00:35,684
Emulate every quality of your brother.

503
01:00:36,389 --> 01:00:41,088
Only the fortunate are blessed
with such a son and brother.

504
01:00:50,236 --> 01:00:53,467
What can I tell you?

505
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:03,814
We brought her home
with such splendor.

506
01:01:05,285 --> 01:01:07,981
Isn't it?

507
01:02:12,085 --> 01:02:16,283
Excuse my saying this but
this is the law of the world...

508
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:19,452
Gradually bonds break up.

509
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:23,787
The times you spend together are yours.

510
01:02:24,097 --> 01:02:27,897
I'm glad you are keeping
yourself busy with work.

511
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:35,373
I've studied all the papers. Begin
work on the electricity division.

512
01:02:36,276 --> 01:02:38,972
From today Vinod will join
me at the factory site.

513
01:02:41,948 --> 01:02:43,540
How do you feel now?

514
01:02:43,850 --> 01:02:45,784
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, grandma.

515
01:02:45,985 --> 01:02:48,954
Exhaustion, I guess.

516
01:02:49,189 --> 01:02:52,158
Don't make Vinod work too hard.

517
01:02:53,493 --> 01:02:54,983
That he will have to do.

518
01:02:55,328 --> 01:02:59,196
He should have full knowledge of
production before the inauguration.

519
01:02:59,532 --> 01:03:02,626
So he can return and take
training in finance and sales.

520
01:03:03,103 --> 01:03:05,230
I won't go back.

521
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:11,436
I won't leave you and sister-in-law.

522
01:03:22,255 --> 01:03:25,520
What rain!

523
01:03:27,393 --> 01:03:28,553
Sister-in-law!

524
01:03:32,732 --> 01:03:34,063
Sister-in-law...

525
01:03:35,401 --> 01:03:37,767
They have returned.

526
01:03:38,638 --> 01:03:40,299
How are you, Vinod?

527
01:03:40,573 --> 01:03:43,508
- How was the first day at the site?
- Don't ask!

528
01:03:44,077 --> 01:03:46,477
Today I realize how
hard brother works!

529
01:03:46,679 --> 01:03:48,840
I'm starving!

530
01:03:49,115 --> 01:03:51,777
Have a wash. Dinner is ready.

531
01:03:57,490 --> 01:04:00,687
Go and call the little sir.

532
01:04:15,175 --> 01:04:16,802
What happened?

533
01:04:26,586 --> 01:04:28,850
He's dozed off.

534
01:04:29,155 --> 01:04:31,385
That's because he worked hard today.

535
01:04:33,259 --> 01:04:36,023
How sweet is the smile on his face.

536
01:04:37,964 --> 01:04:43,095
The smile has returned to his face.

537
01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:47,233
But I fear... when Prem returns...

538
01:04:47,574 --> 01:04:50,907
How will I assure him?

539
01:04:51,277 --> 01:04:54,804
I think we have talked about it.

540
01:04:54,981 --> 01:04:58,041
Yes. Prem returns today.

541
01:04:58,318 --> 01:05:01,810
Don't spoil our mood by
repeating the same thing.

542
01:05:02,155 --> 01:05:06,251
Kindly leave us alone.
I want to talk to my sister.

543
01:05:18,438 --> 01:05:21,601
I don't have anything
left to say to you.

544
01:05:22,875 --> 01:05:26,606
The only sorrow is...

545
01:05:26,946 --> 01:05:31,508
Today I have no face left
to meet Ram Kishen's eyes.

546
01:05:31,751 --> 01:05:35,209
On whose instigation did you
do this? These butterflies?

547
01:05:36,823 --> 01:05:40,850
Those who never settled down,
can't teach us to run our homes!

548
01:05:41,527 --> 01:05:43,654
They only want to watch the scene!

549
01:05:43,963 --> 01:05:47,626
They will end the play here and
go elsewhere for the curtains!

550
01:05:48,134 --> 01:05:50,568
I am a lawyer.

551
01:05:50,803 --> 01:05:54,466
I've seen families bickering,
relationships breaking up.

552
01:05:55,508 --> 01:06:00,605
I can only say that nobody has
been happy breaking their families.

553
01:06:00,947 --> 01:06:02,972
Nobody can be happy.

554
01:06:03,349 --> 01:06:04,907
See for yourself! Your Prem has
gone straight to meet Vivek.

555
01:06:05,118 --> 01:06:07,211
Instead of coming to see you!

556
01:06:09,822 --> 01:06:11,687
This is not possible.

557
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:14,786
Why not?

558
01:06:15,028 --> 01:06:17,223
Son, we will return
with you and Sadhna.

559
01:06:18,531 --> 01:06:23,434
We've shared so many moments
of happiness with this family.

560
01:06:23,803 --> 01:06:26,169
I won't let it be overcast
be clouds of sorrow!

561
01:06:26,406 --> 01:06:32,003
Today is such a happy day.
We hear Sadhna's giving us good news.

562
01:06:33,179 --> 01:06:35,613
Accompany Prem even if only
to share this good news!

563
01:06:36,215 --> 01:06:38,683
Adarsh, you tell Vivek.

564
01:06:41,254 --> 01:06:46,658
I understand your
feelings and Prem's too.

565
01:06:46,893 --> 01:06:53,059
Nobody would be happier than me
if Vivek & Sadhna return to the fold.

566
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:59,595
But Vivek's silence says a lot.

567
01:07:02,542 --> 01:07:07,844
Vivek is doing his duty.
You do yours.

568
01:07:08,114 --> 01:07:11,845
Ram Kishen and the business needs you.

569
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:21,854
Aunt, it is Ram Kishen's values...

570
01:07:22,195 --> 01:07:28,964
...that two brothers today
fight for each others' happiness.

571
01:07:59,465 --> 01:08:02,127
All you brothers are the same.

572
01:08:03,336 --> 01:08:06,203
One heart beats in all three chests.

573
01:08:06,973 --> 01:08:11,876
For the first time I've
seen you brothers fighting.

574
01:08:14,147 --> 01:08:19,585
The one we fight with...
we love him the most.

575
01:08:22,955 --> 01:08:25,253
Listen to me, Prem.

576
01:08:25,658 --> 01:08:30,027
Go back before I become weak.

577
01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:02,719
The little fellow too is here.

578
01:09:06,098 --> 01:09:07,588
How are you?

579
01:09:08,501 --> 01:09:11,937
We're going to become Uncles.
You the elder one, me the younger.

580
01:09:12,472 --> 01:09:14,497
Rosogollas from the sweetmeat shop.

581
01:09:16,108 --> 01:09:17,803
The first one is for Uncle.

582
01:09:18,244 --> 01:09:19,643
Bought specially for you.

583
01:09:19,912 --> 01:09:21,846
- No, I won't eat today.
- Why?

584
01:09:22,048 --> 01:09:23,538
Just don't feel like it.

585
01:09:24,383 --> 01:09:27,546
- Not even one?
- Just half...

586
01:09:32,592 --> 01:09:38,292
Have one. I'm glad though in
a way, we are together.

587
01:09:41,267 --> 01:09:43,633
You don't talk to Prem.
We'll talk to him.

588
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,037
Sounds like him!

589
01:09:52,778 --> 01:09:54,006
Did you call for me?

590
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:56,614
Yes, son. Come inside!

591
01:10:00,152 --> 01:10:02,518
Come in and sit down.

592
01:10:05,491 --> 01:10:07,482
Whatever your mother did,
good or bad...

593
01:10:07,727 --> 01:10:10,195
It's for your good and Vinod's.

594
01:10:10,863 --> 01:10:13,798
A mother gambles all that
she has for her children.

595
01:10:14,267 --> 01:10:17,259
So don't be mad with your mother.

596
01:10:18,704 --> 01:10:21,172
I say, what has she done?

597
01:10:21,474 --> 01:10:25,342
Since she heard, Sadhana
is giving us good news...

598
01:10:25,645 --> 01:10:27,840
We've been spreading joys!

599
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,947
We're distributing saris
to all the ladies in Club.

600
01:10:31,183 --> 01:10:35,244
And this silver present for
all friends and relatives.

601
01:10:35,755 --> 01:10:37,052
What else is required?

602
01:10:37,290 --> 01:10:39,656
Even a real mother wouldn't do this.

603
01:10:44,063 --> 01:10:45,894
May I leave?

604
01:10:48,067 --> 01:10:50,501
Everything will remain the same.

605
01:10:50,770 --> 01:10:56,572
Nothing here is the same.
Neither you nor me.

606
01:11:00,646 --> 01:11:03,615
See what Vivek has written to me.

607
01:11:04,483 --> 01:11:08,249
Today Prem has become
the Managing Director.

608
01:11:08,854 --> 01:11:10,788
Stay with him all day.

609
01:11:11,023 --> 01:11:12,991
Close to him.

610
01:11:13,492 --> 01:11:16,928
He has never measured
relations with money.

611
01:11:17,463 --> 01:11:20,864
We always considered his
simplicity his weakness.

612
01:11:22,034 --> 01:11:25,595
Actually that is his strength.

613
01:11:26,305 --> 01:11:28,899
Give him lots of love.

614
01:11:40,152 --> 01:11:41,642
May I ask you something?

615
01:11:42,822 --> 01:11:46,588
When the elder brother's love
and father's blessing are with you...

616
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:50,060
Why don't you sit on your chair?

617
01:11:50,663 --> 01:11:52,494
Why here...?

618
01:11:54,133 --> 01:11:56,158
This is elder brother's right.

619
01:11:58,204 --> 01:12:00,638
Whenever he returns, whichever day...

620
01:12:01,273 --> 01:12:03,537
He'll find everything the same.

621
01:12:04,744 --> 01:12:08,180
You worry for no reasomn.
It will take Prem time to realize.

622
01:12:11,884 --> 01:12:14,751
We achieved what we wanted.

623
01:12:15,287 --> 01:12:17,448
He has become the Managing Director!

624
01:12:18,958 --> 01:12:23,361
You just make his favorite
dishes and feed him yourself.

625
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:28,294
We'll see how long the son
will be mad with the mother.

626
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,569
Bye bhaijaan.

627
01:12:39,445 --> 01:12:44,246
You haven't eaten a thing since
morning. Eat something now.

628
01:12:45,584 --> 01:12:47,814
Yes Bhaijaan.

629
01:13:16,782 --> 01:13:19,410
Wash up and come. Dinner is ready.

630
01:13:20,519 --> 01:13:23,682
No, mother. I'm not hungry.

631
01:13:29,261 --> 01:13:31,786
All your favorite dishes.

632
01:13:32,598 --> 01:13:34,566
I made them.

633
01:13:36,669 --> 01:13:39,900
I'm not hungry.

634
01:13:58,257 --> 01:14:01,988
I've shifted your things
to the room upstairs.

635
01:14:09,201 --> 01:14:10,600
Where are you going?

636
01:14:10,803 --> 01:14:14,933
To bring my things
back from Vivek's room.

637
01:14:42,802 --> 01:14:47,034
You and Preeti have to
stay here after marriage.

638
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,006
How did you even think of it?

639
01:14:51,577 --> 01:14:54,808
The entire fault is mine!

640
01:14:55,314 --> 01:14:57,544
I'm to be blamed!

641
01:14:57,817 --> 01:15:03,221
I love you so much!
Fight the world for you!

642
01:15:03,889 --> 01:15:06,289
Doesn't a mother have this right?

643
01:15:06,759 --> 01:15:11,423
She does. Only if she doesn't
differentiate between the kids.

644
01:15:11,664 --> 01:15:15,600
I didn't do anything.
Vivek left on his own.

645
01:15:15,901 --> 01:15:18,529
And you let him go?

646
01:15:21,574 --> 01:15:24,805
Tomorrow if I want to leave
everything and go away...

647
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:27,137
Will you let me go?

648
01:15:27,313 --> 01:15:29,645
Won't you stop me?

649
01:15:30,516 --> 01:15:36,148
Right from childhood, Vivek
has respected you more than us.

650
01:15:37,556 --> 01:15:39,990
He has loved you the most.

651
01:15:40,426 --> 01:15:42,519
And you forgot all this!

652
01:15:42,795 --> 01:15:46,561
Try to recall. The Prem and Vinod
for whom you're fighting yourself...

653
01:15:46,932 --> 01:15:49,958
They would have left you
and gone away long back!

654
01:15:50,236 --> 01:15:53,694
If Vivek hadn't lost his
arm to save their lives!

655
01:15:56,942 --> 01:16:01,606
For what happened to Sangita,
you're blaming brother Vivek.

656
01:16:05,117 --> 01:16:08,644
Thinking of Sangita
brings tears to our eyes.

657
01:16:09,021 --> 01:16:12,252
The name of Anurag
fills us with anger.

658
01:16:12,524 --> 01:16:14,856
But are we less at
blame than Anurag?

659
01:16:15,294 --> 01:16:18,457
The Sadhna whom we lovingly
brought home as a bride...

660
01:16:18,831 --> 01:16:20,594
We made her a stranger in a moment!

661
01:16:20,799 --> 01:16:24,235
When she waits at the
foot steps of motherhood!

662
01:16:24,503 --> 01:16:26,630
Isn't this discrimination?

663
01:16:26,839 --> 01:16:28,864
You've acted as a
step-mother, not Vivek!

664
01:16:34,346 --> 01:16:36,746
Nobody can take the place
of brother Vivek and Sadhna.

665
01:16:37,182 --> 01:16:41,084
Neither in this house nor in
this room. Nor in this heart.

666
01:16:42,288 --> 01:16:45,917
And if your conditiion is that
I step into Vivek's shoes...

667
01:16:46,292 --> 01:16:48,783
and Preeti into Sadhna's...

668
01:16:49,061 --> 01:16:53,828
I swear by Sadhna,
I will never get married!

669
01:17:06,578 --> 01:17:08,842
Uncle, forgive me.

670
01:17:09,748 --> 01:17:11,807
I can't get married.

671
01:17:12,151 --> 01:17:16,485
I knew this would be your decision.

672
01:17:18,724 --> 01:17:23,093
The country that honors the brother
as a father and his wife as mother...

673
01:17:23,562 --> 01:17:26,531
Prem will never crush their joys
to erect his own palace of dreams.

674
01:17:28,801 --> 01:17:30,098
I knew it.

675
01:17:32,104 --> 01:17:34,572
I had already told Preeti.

676
01:17:53,058 --> 01:17:55,083
Won't you stay?

677
01:18:02,234 --> 01:18:06,193
I wouldn't have been able to take
Sadhna's rights even if you asked me.

678
01:18:16,248 --> 01:18:17,977
Sit down.

679
01:18:58,157 --> 01:19:00,455
Whether we're tied in a bond or not...

680
01:19:01,427 --> 01:19:05,329
We're tied in an
emotiional bond of hearts.

681
01:19:05,531 --> 01:19:06,657
Isn't it?

682
01:19:22,381 --> 01:19:24,349
Don't worry about Sadhna.

683
01:19:26,318 --> 01:19:29,253
Her delivery is my responsibility.

684
01:19:30,022 --> 01:19:33,549
It will be a normal delivery.

685
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:39,096
You might have to go to
the hospital any moment.

686
01:19:39,731 --> 01:19:43,258
- Sit down.
- See what father sent for you.

687
01:19:44,169 --> 01:19:46,603
A little Krishna.

688
01:19:47,272 --> 01:19:50,400
He wants you to always keep
this idol in front of you.

689
01:19:51,810 --> 01:19:54,711
- Give it to me.
- Why are you staying here?

690
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:58,846
- Sapna is here.
- I've taken official leave from sir.

691
01:19:59,351 --> 01:20:01,649
I'm going to stay
here till you deliver.

692
01:20:02,154 --> 01:20:03,849
Tea...

693
01:20:04,556 --> 01:20:08,959
Doctor, Preeti is staying
here leaving all her work.

694
01:20:10,262 --> 01:20:15,222
And Sapna isn't taking part
in her college cultural program.

695
01:20:15,567 --> 01:20:18,627
I have three daughters not one.

696
01:20:19,938 --> 01:20:25,205
Vinod will complete training by
the time the factory is inaugurated.

697
01:20:26,111 --> 01:20:28,773
Then we'll send him back to the city.

698
01:20:29,982 --> 01:20:33,782
Time just flew by
laughing with Sapna.

699
01:20:34,453 --> 01:20:37,547
We didn't realize anything.

700
01:20:37,789 --> 01:20:40,656
Time moves at its' own pace.

701
01:20:41,693 --> 01:20:46,096
Time takes its' tests
all the time in some way.

702
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:50,726
I don't understand! Why has
productiion in the factory stopped?

703
01:20:51,403 --> 01:20:53,268
We faced technical
problems earrlier too!

704
01:20:53,572 --> 01:20:56,006
Sir, Anand could tackle them.

705
01:20:59,778 --> 01:21:01,712
I've heard this a number of times.

706
01:21:01,947 --> 01:21:04,313
Quickly appoint a good engineer.

707
01:21:04,583 --> 01:21:06,813
In this manner, we won't be
able to clear the bank loans!

708
01:21:14,026 --> 01:21:16,290
I'm on my way.

709
01:21:37,716 --> 01:21:39,741
Now how are they?

710
01:21:39,952 --> 01:21:42,079
They still have high temperature.

711
01:21:42,287 --> 01:21:45,723
Jyoti mentioned that they haven't
been eating well for some days.

712
01:21:46,158 --> 01:21:48,490
They've stopped playing too.

713
01:21:49,494 --> 01:21:53,658
- Yes.
- Anyway continue the medicines.

714
01:21:54,132 --> 01:21:55,622
Inform me tomorrow morning.

715
01:21:58,337 --> 01:22:00,737
I have to talk to you.

716
01:22:01,273 --> 01:22:04,299
I want to say something to
you as your family doctor.

717
01:22:06,411 --> 01:22:09,744
Children are as delicate as flowers.

718
01:22:10,616 --> 01:22:14,347
If they don't find a loving
enviroment, they wither away.

719
01:22:15,787 --> 01:22:17,812
And that's not good.

720
01:22:18,290 --> 01:22:23,626
I'm unable to give them time
because of my problems at work.

721
01:22:24,563 --> 01:22:27,191
I often lose my temper with them.

722
01:22:27,499 --> 01:22:30,559
Yesterday you raised your hand at them.

723
01:22:31,036 --> 01:22:33,300
They were being stubborn.

724
01:22:33,538 --> 01:22:36,098
They wanted to go to
Anand and Sangita.

725
01:22:36,375 --> 01:22:39,742
Why don't you give in to them?

726
01:22:42,714 --> 01:22:47,913
Don't lose the peace of your
family to personal grudges.

727
01:22:48,353 --> 01:22:51,584
Or no doctor will be able to help.

728
01:23:44,476 --> 01:23:47,411
Anand and his wife have come!

729
01:23:47,746 --> 01:23:49,976
With Radhika!

730
01:23:57,856 --> 01:24:00,416
Brother!

731
01:24:07,933 --> 01:24:11,460
You didn't inform us that
Raju and Bablu were so ill.

732
01:24:12,671 --> 01:24:15,834
We left as soon as
sister-in-law called up.

733
01:24:23,148 --> 01:24:26,311
You didn't consider us family.

734
01:24:29,121 --> 01:24:31,487
Forgive me.

735
01:24:33,759 --> 01:24:36,819
Forgive me.

736
01:24:39,398 --> 01:24:41,491
What are you saying?

737
01:24:41,767 --> 01:24:44,395
I had turned blind with selfishness.

738
01:24:44,669 --> 01:24:47,866
I acheived one success
after another in business.

739
01:24:48,106 --> 01:24:51,234
I assumed it was because of me.

740
01:24:51,643 --> 01:24:57,707
But after Anand left, I found
out the success wasn't mine.

741
01:24:58,250 --> 01:25:01,686
But of our team.

742
01:25:02,254 --> 01:25:05,314
Since Anand left home,
without asking or taking anything...

743
01:25:05,624 --> 01:25:08,957
I haven't had any peace.

744
01:25:09,361 --> 01:25:12,660
I lost everything I had.

745
01:25:12,964 --> 01:25:14,693
The happiness of the children.

746
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:17,694
The smile on Jyoti's face.

747
01:25:18,203 --> 01:25:20,637
But we're together again!

748
01:25:20,906 --> 01:25:22,840
We will live together.

749
01:25:24,376 --> 01:25:27,436
Today is such a joyous day.

750
01:25:28,246 --> 01:25:31,511
My daughter's house
is settled again.

751
01:25:33,084 --> 01:25:37,350
We've come to ask you for something.

752
01:25:38,190 --> 01:25:42,183
Ask brother Vivek to return home.

753
01:25:46,631 --> 01:25:52,001
It was Vivek's belief that
we'll be together again.

754
01:25:53,104 --> 01:25:57,507
I remember the day we were
leaving for Banglore...

755
01:25:57,776 --> 01:26:00,404
He placed his hand on
my head and said...

756
01:26:00,612 --> 01:26:04,548
All your sorrows be mine
May all my joys be yours.

757
01:26:29,274 --> 01:26:31,799
I've committed a grave sin!

758
01:26:32,143 --> 01:26:34,441
A grave sin!

759
01:26:34,679 --> 01:26:36,579
Nothing is lost.

760
01:26:37,983 --> 01:26:39,883
Look there.

761
01:26:53,098 --> 01:26:55,032
No, Mamta.

762
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:57,900
You are the same Mamta for me.

763
01:26:58,303 --> 01:27:01,363
...who gave our children
such a noble upbringing.

764
01:27:01,673 --> 01:27:04,506
Made them such good humans.

765
01:27:05,710 --> 01:27:09,271
Shall we go to Rampur?

766
01:27:09,481 --> 01:27:12,780
We are going to be grandparents.

767
01:27:14,119 --> 01:27:17,611
Yes, Sadhna needs you
the most at this hour.

768
01:27:21,493 --> 01:27:23,518
Anything to worry about?

769
01:27:23,728 --> 01:27:25,958
No, Sadhna is fine.

770
01:27:27,632 --> 01:27:30,692
Start the final testing of the
machines. We're off to the hospital.

771
01:27:33,605 --> 01:27:36,039
- Brother is here!
- Hurrah!

772
01:27:36,508 --> 01:27:39,671
- You've become a Papa!
- You have a son!

773
01:27:42,013 --> 01:27:43,742
Many congratulations.

774
01:27:44,149 --> 01:27:46,276
- You...?
- Talk later.

775
01:27:46,785 --> 01:27:48,685
Sangita, take him in.

776
01:27:48,954 --> 01:27:50,581
Let's go.

777
01:28:05,370 --> 01:28:07,338
Mother...

778
01:28:08,573 --> 01:28:12,009
I've come to take my
daughter-in-law and grandson home.

779
01:28:12,344 --> 01:28:15,313
I won't take him.

780
01:28:17,549 --> 01:28:21,781
You left. Not once did
you ask your mother...

781
01:28:22,420 --> 01:28:25,116
What is my fault?

782
01:28:45,477 --> 01:28:49,106
Attentiion! The heir to the
family is making his entry!

783
01:28:50,315 --> 01:28:52,442
- Give the baby to me!
- No!

784
01:28:53,118 --> 01:28:55,177
- I'm the aunt!
- No!

785
01:28:55,353 --> 01:28:57,048
It's the Papa's turn first.

786
01:28:57,422 --> 01:29:00,983
No, first of all it's
the turn of Papa's mummy.

787
01:29:07,065 --> 01:29:10,831
Aunt, compared to all
the joys of the world...

788
01:29:11,169 --> 01:29:13,569
The joy of becoming a
grandmother is the best.

789
01:29:17,275 --> 01:29:20,608
Mother, all of us are in
line to meet the baby.

790
01:29:21,379 --> 01:29:24,871
- Me, first.
- Sure.

791
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:27,784
Aunt before the Uncle.

792
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:31,454
Let's love him together.

793
01:29:32,023 --> 01:29:36,483
It's also the right of the elder
uncle and aunt to love the baby.

794
01:29:40,965 --> 01:29:43,126
Yes, Prem.

795
01:29:44,969 --> 01:29:47,631
One day for my sake...

796
01:29:47,972 --> 01:29:50,770
You took a pledge in front of mother.

797
01:29:50,975 --> 01:29:52,704
Today for my sake I want you,

798
01:29:52,844 --> 01:29:54,778
You take another pledge.

799
01:30:26,778 --> 01:30:28,746
Garland her.

800
01:30:31,282 --> 01:30:34,012
Here is your Mummy!

801
01:30:56,341 --> 01:30:58,935
- Okay, you may...
- I have garlanded her.

802
01:31:33,178 --> 01:31:39,208
Sister-in-law, on thid joyous
occasion I've brought special sweets!

803
01:31:39,484 --> 01:31:41,349
You really do too much!

804
01:31:41,619 --> 01:31:46,318
Forgive me for all that I did
so far was with ulterior motives.

805
01:31:46,624 --> 01:31:49,991
Blinded by love for my daughter.

806
01:31:50,228 --> 01:31:53,629
I fed flour to the ants,
watered the god of the trees.

807
01:31:53,932 --> 01:31:57,732
- Prayers, invocatioin...
- Yes, I did all that.

808
01:31:58,269 --> 01:32:04,731
But I couldn't shake the
foundation of your family.

809
01:32:06,578 --> 01:32:09,172
Mother Ram Kishen is right.

810
01:32:09,414 --> 01:32:11,814
It's all a game of values.
