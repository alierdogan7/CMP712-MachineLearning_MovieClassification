1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,150
(young boy) Hey, Mowgli!

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,992
(girl) Hush. It's starting.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,390
(man) Come, children. Come watch.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,358
Mowgli, tell us your story.

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,229
I never knew where I came from.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,312
But I always knew where I belonged.

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,270
This is me and Bagheera, the panther
who found me in the jungle.

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,191
He's a good friend.

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,432
But my best friend of all
was good ol' Papa Bear.

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,754
Man, we had
some crazy times together.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,391
And when the monkeys grabbed me,
things got really crazy.

12
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,550
(Ranjan) Monkeys!

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,556
Bad monkeys! Bad!

14
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,669
Go, Papa Bear!

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,434
(Mowgli) Then I came face to face

16
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,991
with the meanest,
scariest tiger in the whole jungle,

17
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,196
Shere Khan.

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,156
(yells)

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,199
You stay away from Mowgli,
you mean old tiger,

20
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,671
or I'll tie some fire to your tail
and burn your butt!

21
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,749
(yells)

22
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,632
(laughter)

23
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,790
(roars)

24
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,713
I got him, Mowgli. Did you see?

25
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,358
You sure did, Ranjan.

26
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,273
But it's gonna be hard
to finish the story now.

27
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,635
But we all know how it ends.

28
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:54,714
Shanti blinks her big,
beautiful brown eyes at you,

29
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,270
and you follow her into our village.

30
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,875
- I did not.
- Did so!

31
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,793
- Something was in my eye.
- Both of them?

32
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,713
Well, you were so ugly,
you made my eyes water.

33
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,949
Well, you...

34
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,431
Now, now, we give thanks
for Shanti's beautiful brown eyes.

35
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,991
Without them, Mowgli would never
have come into our lives.

36
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,390
Come to think of it,
you used the same trick on me.

37
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,994
And you still fall for it.

38
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,357
Thank you for a wonderful story,
Mowgli.

39
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,878
- Goodnight, Mowgli.
- Night, Shanti.

40
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,997
Watch out for Shere Khan
on your way home.

41
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,798
You and your stories.

42
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,555
Everyone knows tigers
don't come into the village.

43
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,394
Tigers go wherever they want!

44
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,152
Goodnight, boys.

45
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,039
Tomorrow's gonna be so great.

46
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,156
Erm... nothing.

47
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:07,190
Uh-huh. Well, you'll need plenty
of rest for doing nothing tomorrow.

48
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,759
Off to bed.

49
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,469
(yawns) We never get to stay up late.

50
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,194
Even wild beasts need their sleep.

51
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,431
- (roars)
- Help! Ferocious tiger!

52
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,551
Goodnight, my little wild thing.

53
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,311
Goodnight, Mowgli.

54
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,789
Happy dreams.

55
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,108
Erm...

56
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,158
Goodnight, sir.

57
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,679
Why do you always call him "sir"?
His name's Pop.

58
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,757
(snoring)

59
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,877
(roars)

60
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,839
Hmm!

61
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,553
(roars)

62
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,629
(yells)

63
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,518
Come on, Mowgli, wake up!
It's morning.

64
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,033
You said we'd go to...

65
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,269
Ranjan.

66
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,512
You want to wake the whole village?
When does the tiger roar?

67
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,349
I don't know.

68
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,910
After he catches his prey.

69
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,714
His prey.

70
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,031
Let's go get our prey.

71
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,596
(humming)

72
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,357
- Boys?
- Huh!

73
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,271
Where are you going so early?

74
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,238
To... do our chores?

75
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,958
Not without breakfast.

76
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,993
(singing)

77
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,994
- That's OK. We're not hungry.
- Got to go!

78
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,672
Boys! Where are you going?

79
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,558
- To do our chores!
- Bye, Pop! See you later.

80
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,518
Remember, don't cross the river.

81
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,993
You can take the boy
out of the jungle.

82
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,038
But you can't take the jungle
out of the boy.

83
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,235
Yes.

84
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,153
That's what worries me.

85
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,552
- Hey, Shanti!
- Ah!

86
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,198
What are you doing here?

87
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,953
Getting water.
What are you doing here?

88
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,635
Oh, I'm on the lookout...
for danger.

89
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,711
Danger? Please.

90
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,916
There's no danger around here.

91
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,794
Well, keep this just between us.

92
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,394
Yesterday, I saw tiger tracks.

93
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,948
Tiger tracks? Right.

94
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,235
It's Shere Khan.

95
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,038
I hear he's looking for me.

96
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,556
Seeking his bloodthirsty revenge.

97
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,679
So keep your ears open,
and always watch your back,

98
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,832
or the last thing
you'll ever hear is...

99
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,478
(roar)

100
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,437
(screams)

101
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,716
When does the tiger roar?

102
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,518
(both roar)

103
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,238
You're horrible!
Horrible, stinky boys.

104
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,118
Come on, Ranjan.
He's a bad influence.

105
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,599
Now, don't move.

106
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,478
That wasn't very nice, you know.

107
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,873
Stop that. You're not a jungle boy.

108
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,190
Why are you so scared of the jungle?

109
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,238
- Because it's dangerous.
- Dangerous? But Mowgli says...

110
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,198
You shouldn't listen
to everything Mowgli says.

111
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,510
But I thought you liked Mowgli.

112
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,558
Well, I do. I like Mowgli.

113
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,198
But I have... oh.

114
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,674
Er, you left this at the river.

115
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,596
Thank you.

116
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,274
She's in a bad mood.

117
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,074
Hey, Ranjan.

118
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,835
You want to see a little trick
I learned in the jungle?

119
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,077
That's a pretty good trick.

120
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,153
Well, here's a little trick
I learned right here at home.

121
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,589
Wow.

122
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,636
That's a neater trick.

123
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,158
Like I said, Ranjan,
don't listen to him.

124
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,511
She's right, Ranjan.
Don't listen to me.

125
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,160
Listen to the jungle.

126
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,593
Can you hear it?

127
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,557
Yeah.

128
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,392
The jungle.

129
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,792
Yeah, man.

130
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,998
And when you hear that rhythm,
you get a crazy feeling inside.

131
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,479
# That morning sun
peeks over the mountains

132
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,677
# And all the rhinos rub their eyes
When they hear

133
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,556
Hear what?

134
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,676
# Hear the jungle rhythm

135
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,479
# Those birds
are tap-tap-tappin' the tree trunks

136
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,519
# The busy bee hums as he flies
Loud and clear

137
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,160
# To the jungle rhythm

138
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,629
# Now you can hightail it
out of the jungle

139
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,870
# But it never leaves your heart

140
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,428
# First you feel that beat
start bubbling under

141
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,988
# Then you hear the tom-toms
loud as thunder

142
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,595
# It's moving me
Sounds a lot like being free

143
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,557
# When you feel

144
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,676
# Feel the jungle rhythm

145
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,837
# Feel the jungle rhythm

146
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,480
Come on, Shanti.

147
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,915
# Can't do without rhythm

148
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,312
# And when it fills the air
Animals everywhere

149
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,550
# Join in the dance

150
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,555
# You'll dance along with 'em
Feeling it steal your soul

151
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,359
# - We'll stomp our paws
# - Flap our wings

152
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,955
# Maybe do one or two crazy things

153
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,871
- Khan khan.
- Yeah, that's it.

154
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,190
(monkey noises)

155
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,508
(howls)

156
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,669
(trumpets)

157
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,037
Shanti, try this.

158
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,838
Not quite.

159
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,273
There we go.

160
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,395
No.

161
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,755
Take a look. Perfect.

162
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,712
# Check out those chattering
monkeys

163
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,756
# Swinging through the banyan trees

164
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,992
# Two by two
To the jungle rhythm

165
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,799
# Sounds like a wolf pack
way in the distance

166
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,873
# Singing pretty harmonies
Woo-woo-woo

167
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,758
# To the jungle rhythm

168
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,515
That's it!

169
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,068
# Now you can hightail it
out of the jungle

170
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,390
# But it never leaves your heart

171
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,994
# First you feel that beat
start bubbling under

172
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,548
# Then you hear the tom-toms
loud as thunder

173
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,076
# It's moving me!
Sounds a lot like being free

174
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,472
# - When I feel
# - When I feel, when I feel

175
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,870
# Feel the jungle rhythm

176
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,359
Wait. Wait stop.
You're crossing the river.

177
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,796
Mowgli, you can't go in the jungle.
It's dangerous.

178
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,836
Mowgli! Stop!

179
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,358
Shanti, what is it?

180
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,637
Children, come inside this instant.
All of you.

181
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,913
Mowgli.

182
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,275
That includes you.

183
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,916
I am very disappointed in you.

184
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,036
You put everyone in danger.

185
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,035
You know you're not allowed to cross
the river, yet you disobeyed me.

186
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,031
- But...
- No, Mowgli.

187
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,117
The jungle is a dangerous place.

188
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,474
I should know.

189
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,352
You are confined to your room
without dinner.

190
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,750
That should give you time to think
about what you've done.

191
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,272
Mowgli, I was only trying to...

192
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,595
# Oh, you can hightail it
out of the jungle

193
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,235
# But it never leaves your heart

194
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,711
Oh, Baloo.

195
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,558
# Look for the bare necessities

196
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,835
# The simple bare necessities

197
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,832
# Forget about your worries
and your strife

198
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,515
# Oh, yeah! I mean the...
Do bah badda dadda de da dah

199
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,556
# Rum pah patta reet ta dah

200
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,598
# That bring
the bare necessities of life

201
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,955
Now, that's more like it!

202
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,749
Look at you.
Growing like the proverbial weed.

203
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,512
Let's see if you still got it.

204
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,832
Take it away, Little Britches.

205
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,079
Poor fellow.

206
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,515
I said, take it away!

207
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,836
Well, this ain't gonna work.
You just ain't Mowgli.

208
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,999
I guess I got to get used
to singing solo.

209
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,911
He's just not getting over that...
(gasps)

210
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,880
Oh, no. Not again.

211
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,359
Baloo?

212
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,279
(growls)

213
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,877
Mowgli.

214
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,673
(bird squawks)

215
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,997
(bird squawks)

216
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,916
Get out of here. Shoo!

217
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,997
(bird squawks)

218
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,389
Now, don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

219
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,109
Baloo?

220
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,198
Baloo?

221
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,429
Oh, man.

222
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,630
Bagheera. How's it wagging?

223
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,312
This has to stop.

224
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,472
You can't take Mowgli
from the man village.

225
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,836
The boy's future
lies with his own kind.

226
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,559
Aw, his future can wait.

227
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,471
I miss my bear cub.

228
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,796
It's not safe for him in the jungle.

229
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,030
Shere Khan is looking for Mowgli.

230
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,398
Let Shere Khan try something.
We handled him once, we will again.

231
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,677
- Baloo, don't push your luck.
- Out of the way, Baggy.

232
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,479
You're not going near the village.

233
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,794
Later, Baggy.

234
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,951
That's it! Hathi, plan B!

235
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,351
Hup, two, three, four.
Keep it up, two, three, four.

236
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,228
Remember, men, our objective
is full and complete containment.

237
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,153
Prepare for Operation... Operation...

238
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,231
Er, "Stop That Bear"?

239
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,197
Very good, son.

240
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,590
Prepare for Operation Stop That Bear!

241
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,760
# By the ranks or single file

242
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,990
# Over every jungle mile

243
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,038
# Oh, we stamp and crush
Through the underbrush

244
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,874
Will you please stop?

245
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,270
Brigade, halt!

246
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,269
Huh?

247
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,193
I told you, Baloo,

248
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,352
there's no way we're letting you
near the man village.

249
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,591
You ain't gonna stop me now, Baggy!
Look out below!

250
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,594
- Search the water!
- This way.

251
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,198
Nothing here, sir.

252
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,994
Baloo.

253
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,990
I've got him, Colonel!

254
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,878
Confound it, soldier. That's a fish!

255
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,949
Whoopsie.

256
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,758
Disgrace to the uniform.

257
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,750
Colonel! This log can't possibly
support your weight!

258
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,672
Balderdash!
Why, my dear boy, back in '88,

259
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,753
- in service to the Crown...
- Oh, no. Not again.

260
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,597
They don't make trees
like they used to.

261
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,838
Got him!

262
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,309
Got him right here!

263
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,914
Disguised as a panther, Baloo?

264
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,798
It's me, Hathi. Put me down

265
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,029
Sorry.

266
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,792
Keep searching, men.
He couldn't have gone far.

267
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,759
- My toes are getting pruney!
- Who are we looking for again?

268
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,389
Confound it, man.
We're looking for the elusive...

269
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,796
Don't turn me in, little guy.
I just want to see my bear cub.

270
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,476
I won't. I miss Mowgli, too.
This way, quick!

271
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,039
Hey, thanks, kid. You're alright.

272
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,029
(growls)

273
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,912
Say, fellas, look who's coming.

274
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,638
That's Shere Khan.

275
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,439
- What'll we do?
- Don't start that again.

276
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,954
Lucky. Hey, Lucky.

277
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,356
Yeah?

278
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,512
That's the one we told you about.
Shere Khan.

279
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,749
Mmm!

280
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,400
Shere Khan. You don't say.

281
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,994
Hey, watch this. I got one for you.

282
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,071
Oi, look at me! Look at me!

283
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,679
I'm Shere Khan
and my tiger tushie's been torched!

284
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,673
Ask me if I can whup that tiger.
Go on.

285
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,159
Can you whup that tiger?

286
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,595
I Shere Khan!

287
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,837
Do you get it? Save me! Save me!

288
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:40,358
I've been outwitted by 40 pounds
of scrawny man cub! Help!

289
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,910
I'm cracking myself up here.
I don't know how I do it.

290
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,837
(growls)

291
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,189
(rustling)

292
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,272
(rattling)

293
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,070
(pot breaks)

294
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,073
Hi, kid. Mind if I drop in?

295
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,629
Baloo?

296
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,914
Oh, Baloo...

297
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,994
Shhh!

298
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,513
(muffled shouts)

299
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,710
Papa Bear! Am I glad to see you.
What are you doing here?

300
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,949
What am I doing here?

301
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,589
Feeling right for the first time
in a while, that's what.

302
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,752
Hey, kid. Show me
you can still fight like a bear.

303
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,238
Oh, Little Britches,
you lost your touch.

304
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,635
Mowgli, I've got something for you.

305
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,156
Mowgli, it's me.

306
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,470
I get grounded all the time.

307
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,393
Ah. (chuckles)

308
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,358
I'm sorry you got in trouble.

309
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,679
Come on, man cub. Show yourself.

310
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,191
- (Baloo) Come on!
- Whoa!

311
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,269
Mowgli?

312
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,993
Come on. Stick and move.

313
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,795
(screams)

314
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,677
Help! Wild animal!

315
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,433
Wild animal? Where?
Let's get out of here.

316
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,873
Help!

317
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,229
What's that bear doing here?

318
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,436
There's a wild animal in the village!

319
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,748
What's the matter?

320
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,717
There he is.

321
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,758
Where are you going? No!

322
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,115
Come back!
You're going the wrong way!

323
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,995
Whoa! A tiger!

324
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,911
(roars)

325
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,956
Don't let him get away.

326
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,028
- No!
- (Baloo) Get outta here!

327
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,195
- Shanti, get indoors.
- No, no. He's over... No!

328
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,949
Shanti!

329
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,471
Shanti, wait for me.

330
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,713
A tiger.

331
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,912
Come on, follow me!

332
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,311
- Whoa!
- Mowgli!

333
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,797
Hold on, Mowgli.

334
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,754
Mowgli!

335
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,955
(Father) Mowgli, where are you?

336
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,359
- Mowgli!
- They must be in the jungle.

337
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,556
Ah! (chuckles)

338
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,431
The jungle!

339
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,671
What a weird scene.
Is that place always like that?

340
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,031
You don't know the half of it.
That village was terrible.

341
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,954
All you hear is rules, rules, rules
and work, work, work.

342
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,031
Kid, watch your language.

343
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,636
That's all they do! Washing,
dressing, fetching, cleaning...

344
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,312
I'm tired just listening to it.

345
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,868
Sounds like they're screwy
over there.

346
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,236
I don't want to talk about it.
Especially Shanti.

347
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,675
- Who's Shanti?
- Just a girl from the village.

348
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:06,153
Hold on. Not the one that lured you
into that village in the first place?

349
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,879
Yup. That's the one.

350
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,191
I knew it! I knew she was trouble!

351
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,670
I tried bringing her to the jungle
and she got me in trouble.

352
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,829
Say again?

353
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,480
I wanted her to see what fun we have.

354
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,516
And she got you into trouble?

355
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,999
- Yep!
- Ooh, man.

356
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,753
She thinks the jungle is scary.

357
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,877
- Where'd she get that crazy idea?
- You got me.

358
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,989
Do my snake eyes deceive me?

359
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:39,157
It's the succulent man cub.

360
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,112
You're with me now, kid.
Forget that girl.

361
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,034
You're better off without her.
You got everything you need here.

362
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,556
And me?
I got my old singing partner back.

363
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,918
Then hit it, Papa Bear!

364
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,719
# Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities

365
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,236
# Forget about your worries
and your strife

366
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,118
# I mean the bare necessities

367
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,350
# Old Mother Nature's recipes

368
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,274
# That bring
the bare necessities of life

369
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,635
# - Wherever I wander
- Where you going?

370
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,551
# - Wherever I roam
- Oh, yeah.

371
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,872
# I couldn't be fonder
Of my big home

372
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:25,034
# The bees are buzzing in the tree
To make some honey just for me

373
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,588
# When you look under
The rocks and plants

374
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,591
# Take a glance at the fancy ants

375
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,398
# And maybe try a few

376
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,913
Thanks, Baloo.

377
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,876
# The bare necessities of life
will come to you

378
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,235
# They'll come to you

379
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,469
Oh, Baloo!

380
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,473
I don't want ever to see that girl
or that village again.

381
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:51,599
Well, of course you don't.
It's just us bears from here on in.

382
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,272
Yeah, man.

383
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,999
Hey. You remember everything
I learned you?

384
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,389
You bet I do, Papa Bear.

385
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,959
- Nah-uh!
- Huh?

386
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,076
# When you pick a pawpaw

387
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,310
# Or a prickly pear

388
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,871
# And you pick a raw paw
Well, next time, beware

389
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,155
# Don't pick the prickly pear
by the paw

390
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,708
# When you pick a pear
Try to use a claw

391
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,995
# But you don't need to use a claw

392
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,674
# When you pick a pair
of the big pawpaw

393
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,910
Have I given you a clue?

394
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,678
# The bare necessities of life
will come to you

395
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,671
# - They'll come to you
- To me?

396
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:36,118
I so despise
these song-and-dance routines.

397
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,151
Mowgli?

398
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,919
Mowgli? Is that you?

399
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,234
Mowgli?

400
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,992
(hoots)

401
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,670
He's gotta be here somewhere.

402
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,352
(rip)

403
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,628
(squawks)

404
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,868
(screeching)

405
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,759
I swear...

406
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,236
...I shall never again associate...

407
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,400
with man cubs.

408
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,276
(pants)

409
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,918
Where could he be?

410
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,714
(sniffs)

411
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,192
Why, the little...

412
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,230
...snack.

413
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,749
Who is it?

414
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,869
Who's there? (gasps)

415
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,316
Excuse me.

416
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:08,952
Might I be of some assistance?

417
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,759
Are you lost, little one?

418
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,997
Are you hungry?

419
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,477
I'm starved.

420
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,750
Bad snake! Bad, bad snake!

421
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,354
Ranjan? What are you doing here?

422
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,750
You leave Shanti alone!

423
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,715
OK, Ranjan, I think he's had enough.

424
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,594
(roars)

425
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,073
You're not getting away that easy.

426
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,958
Ranjan,
you're not supposed to be here.

427
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,393
We have to get you home.

428
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,109
No! Mowgli's in trouble
and we're gonna find him.

429
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,918
I can smell him.

430
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,519
He's this way!

431
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,398
Oh, OK.

432
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,391
But stay close.

433
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,199
We don't want to run
into any more scary animals.

434
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,397
- (roars)
- Oh, stop that!

435
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,033
Oh, mercy.

436
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,513
(chuckling)

437
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,790
Shere Khan?

438
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,713
Anyone I know?

439
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,039
I wish.

440
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,597
Stupid man cub.

441
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,432
Man cub?

442
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,074
Did I say man cub?

443
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,230
Well, you know...

444
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,789
...l'd love to stay
and shoot the breeze and all, but...

445
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,959
What's your hurry?

446
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,313
No reason. I, I...

447
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,152
Where is he?

448
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,949
- Who he?
- The man cub, Mowgli.

449
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,190
I know you know.

450
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,430
But I, I don't.

451
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,752
Please don't insult my intelligence.
It makes me irritable.

452
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,274
Oh. He's not in the village.

453
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,510
I know where he isn't.

454
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,593
Now tell me where he is.

455
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,114
Well, he's, he's...

456
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,148
The swamp!

457
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,754
He's at the swamp.

458
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,434
- The swamp, eh?
- Yes.

459
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,398
Trust in me.

460
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,517
He'd better be... for your sake.

461
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,318
He is. He is.

462
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,996
I'd take you there myself,
but I'm afraid I'd slow you down.

463
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,877
Indigestion and all.

464
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,430
(Father) Mowgli!

465
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,158
(Mother) Ranjan!

466
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,076
What is it? What on earth?

467
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,991
Retreat!

468
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,388
- Colonel Hathi.
- Take cover!

469
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,472
Oh, no. Not again.

470
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,079
(parp)

471
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,152
Excuse me.

472
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,831
Pardon.

473
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,629
Colonel Hathi,
what is the meaning of this?

474
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,359
Man is in the jungle.

475
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,556
What does he want?

476
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,750
Mowgli!

477
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,151
Perhaps I was too harsh with the boy.

478
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,032
Don't worry. We'll find them.

479
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,394
Mowgli!

480
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,629
Ranjan!

481
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,029
Baloo.

482
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,110
Uh! Almost got it, Baloo.

483
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,838
Whoa!

484
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,750
Them primo mangoes,
always the hardest to get.

485
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,193
Got 'em.

486
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,191
This is the life.

487
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,759
Heads up.

488
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,471
Delicious.

489
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,312
Hey, check this out.

490
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,353
Hey. Not bad.
Where'd you learn that?

491
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,750
- Shanti showed me.
- Shanti?

492
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,596
No. I, I said wanti.

493
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,433
I wanti another mango.

494
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,876
No, that's not what you said.
You said Shanti.

495
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,915
No, I didn't.

496
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,672
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

497
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,591
- Did.
- Didn't.

498
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,033
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-uh.

499
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,793
- I heard it.
- Who cares about Shanti?

500
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,314
It's just a stupid trick, right?

501
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,392
Yeah, right.
You don't need her, kid.

502
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,630
You're with old Baloo now.

503
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,114
What are you laughing at?

504
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,231
What're you doing here, Baggy?

505
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,992
Haven't you heard?

506
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,196
Man is in the jungle.

507
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,910
What do they want?

508
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,116
They're searching for Mowgli.

509
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,474
Mowgli?

510
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,199
Perhaps maybe you
have seen the boy.

511
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,157
Me? Uh, no.

512
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,789
Well, you know
his future is in that village.

513
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,675
Yes.

514
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,553
I just wish I knew where he was.

515
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,758
Yeah. Sorry.
I wish I could help you out, Baggy.

516
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,638
Enough games, Baloo!
Give me the boy.

517
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,359
Baggy, Baggy, Baggy.
I can explain.

518
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,192
I can explain. I...

519
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,430
I can explain, but I don't have to.

520
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:52,390
As you can plainly see,
Mowgli is not here. I'm all alone.

521
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,632
I know he's around here somewhere.
And he can't hide forever.

522
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,075
Well, he won't get past you, Baggy.

523
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,709
Kid?

524
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,392
Kid, where'd you go?

525
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,637
You trying to scare the tick
out of my ticker?

526
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:22,352
Wow.
The whole village, looking for me?

527
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,637
- We can't let nobody see you.
- I thought they were mad.

528
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,472
We got to lay low.

529
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,957
They must really miss me.

530
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,032
I wonder if Shanti's with them.

531
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,269
Shanti?

532
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,874
You definitely don't want her
to find you.

533
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,318
Do you?

534
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,470
No. We can't let anyone find us,
especially that girl.

535
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,916
Come on, Baloo, we gotta get
moving. Lay low. Hunker down.

536
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,399
Hibernate, like.

537
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,516
Now, Mowgli,
what if that girl tracks us down?

538
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,716
What are you going to do?

539
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,916
Then you'll have to scare her.

540
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,037
Scare her?
Has the milk run out of your coconut?

541
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,715
No, she's terrified of wild animals.

542
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,429
In case you haven't noticed, kid,
I'm no wild animal.

543
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,431
Except at parties.

544
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,637
I suppose I'm more of a honey bear.

545
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,508
You can do it, Baloo.
You taught me, remember?

546
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,795
You scrunch up your eyes like this.

547
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,075
And show your teeth like this.

548
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,233
And roar like this. (roars)

549
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,117
Roar?

550
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,873
No, no. Like you mean it!

551
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,032
Do you want that girl to take me back
to the village?

552
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,677
(roars)

553
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,154
Yeah, man. That was great.

554
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,719
Well, I don't know.

555
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,358
Trust me, that'll do it.

556
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,956
In that case, Mowgli,
consider that girl scarified.

557
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,112
- Thanks, Papa Bear.
- Anything for my Little Britches.

558
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,599
OK, let's skedaddle.

559
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,558
Now don't worry.
I got a place downriver.

560
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,359
- It's the perfect hideout.
- Real quiet, huh?

561
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,270
Quiet?

562
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:14,639
You want quiet, go back to the
man village. This place is happening.

563
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,154
OK, here's the village.

564
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,038
- We cross the river and...
- (Ranjan roars)

565
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,429
Ranjan, be careful!

566
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,198
OK, we went right.

567
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,748
No, no, no, left. Left, I mean.

568
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,638
Right. No, left, then right.

569
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,233
Oh!

570
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,039
This jungle all looks the same!

571
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,317
- (laughs)
- Ranjan, what's that?

572
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,398
Mowgli? He must have been here!

573
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:52,635
Or some animal
with really sharp claws.

574
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,310
That snake lied to me.

575
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,599
Now, don't take it out on the water

576
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,478
just because
you don't like the reflection.

577
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:28,229
I mean, not everyone
can be born with such great looks.

578
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,880
You let that tiger
get his claws on you

579
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,349
and you won't be so good-looking.

580
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,672
What? That pussycat?
He's harmless. Watch this.

581
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,988
Oh, no.

582
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,472
What's the matter, Stripes?

583
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,154
Man cub got your tongue?

584
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,471
Lucky, let's find something to do
somewhere else.

585
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,154
No, no. Hang on, fellas.
I got another one.

586
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,358
How many men does it take
to whup a tiger?

587
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,993
Surprise me.

588
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,799
None. A little kid can do it
all by himself.

589
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,432
(growls)

590
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,318
- Come on, Lucky, let's go.
- Come on.

591
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,756
In fact, we heard that kid
is right here in the jungle.

592
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,389
Right under your whiskers.

593
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,038
Interesting.

594
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,759
I heard he's headed
back to the village.

595
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,671
Wrong again, kitty.

596
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,228
No, Lucky, keep your gob shut.

597
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,835
They say he's headed downriver,
with a bear.

598
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,639
Downriver, you say?

599
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,392
Don't listen to him.

600
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,677
Yeah. He's new around here.
He don't know anything

601
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,036
On the contrary,
he seems to know quite a lot.

602
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,915
Hold on, hot pants! Where's the fire?

603
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,353
Isn't it ironic
that your name is Lucky?

604
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,634
(all scream)

605
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,109
Come on, lads, this way!

606
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,629
This is the perfect hideout?
This is King Louie's place.

607
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,395
Was, kid, was. He's splitsville.

608
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:23,632
Me and the monkeys turned it into
the greatest secret hideout ever.

609
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:29,317
Coming through. Hey, Baloo.
Good to see you back again, man.

610
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:34,758
- Everybody knows about it.
- Then how can it be a secret?

611
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,876
I mean, everybody who's anybody.

612
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,952
Nobody who's nobody don't know
nothing about no place

613
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,749
that everybody who's anybody
knows about. You dig?

614
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,432
My head hurts.

615
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,513
Turn the thinker off a minute
and just dive in.

616
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,991
Step aside, and I'll show you
what a real rug-cutter can do.

617
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:00,439
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

618
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,875
the boss of bop, the jack of jive,

619
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,633
the jungle cat
who's really gonna keep it alive.

620
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,790
Get ready to stir it up
and serve it up.

621
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,998
I'm talking about
Baloo is in the house!

622
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,513
Hey, cats, alright!

623
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,719
# When we start to move
Hey, honey, it ain't no joke

624
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,758
# We got a savage groove
We didn't learn from human folk

625
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,592
# No human folk

626
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,673
# Excuse our incivility
We're W-l-l-l-L-D

627
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,514
# When the music plays
All the people stomp their feet

628
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:38,276
# But a stomping paw
Can lay down a better beat

629
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,396
# Tell me we ain't naturally

630
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,789
# W-l-l-l-L-D

631
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,519
# It's a snap
To bring out the beast in you

632
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,909
# You're free like the bird it's true

633
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,958
# Or a frog or a hog or...
Oh, man, whatever!

634
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,352
# From the baddest cat
To the sweetest little deer

635
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,991
# Tonight's the night
We're gonna get our tails in gear

636
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,752
# Show me your ferocity

637
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,990
# Go W-l-l-l-L-D

638
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,071
# We snort, we squeak

639
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,310
# Up high or deep underground

640
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,709
# We snarl, we shriek

641
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,836
# We fly round and round and round

642
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:17,118
Ah, go, you sweet thing.
That's inhuman, baby.

643
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,350
# The old mongoose
Gets good and loose

644
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,351
# The ocelot gives it all he's got

645
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,635
# The parakeet
Goes, "Twiddlee-deet"

646
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,029
# The red macaque
Shouts "Hang on, Jack!"

647
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,076
# - The tiny worm
# - The pachyderm

648
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,991
# - The spotted cat
# - The water rat

649
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,275
# - The great cuckoo
# - The bear Baloo

650
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,112
# Are W-l-l-l-L-D

651
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,315
# Here's the thing!

652
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,356
# If we're broke, we never squawk

653
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,796
# We don't need to check no clock
To know what time it is

654
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,552
# It's time to rock

655
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,712
# When you dance like that
Hey, honey, it sure is hip

656
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,279
I can't stand it!

657
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,318
# I want to tip my hat
But I got no hat to tip

658
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,594
I don't need no hat.

659
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,830
# Ask me why and I won't lie

660
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,831
# I'm W-l-l-l-L-D

661
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,913
# We grunt, we growl
Up high or deep underground

662
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,150
# We hoot, we howl

663
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,549
# We fly round and round and round

664
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,551
# My oh me, it's plain to see

665
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,949
# We're W-l-l-l-L-D

666
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,951
# He, she, me, uniquely

667
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,156
# W-l-l-l-L-D

668
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,435
# Every beastie running free

669
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,910
# W-l-l-I-I-I

670
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,433
# L-D!

671
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,233
Whoo-hoo. That's my boy.

672
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,710
They don't swing like that
in your man village, do they kid?

673
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,917
Well, no.

674
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,958
Big fat no.
Say, what that village like, anyway?

675
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:47,275
Whoa, don't bother the kid.
He told me all about that scene.

676
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:51,353
Let me lay it out for you.
Those people are crazy.

677
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,671
Everybody works and nobody plays.

678
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,795
Oh, man!

679
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,553
They got nothing
but rules, rules, rules.

680
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:04,431
And there's even this girl who thinks
the jungle is a scary place.

681
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,989
But, you know, it doesn't matter,

682
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:13,870
cos Mowgli will never see that
village or that crazy girl again.

683
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,473
Ain't that so, kid?

684
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,678
Mowgli? Mowgli?

685
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,951
Mowgli?

686
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,311
Mowgli?

687
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,388
# That morning sun

688
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,553
# Peeks over the mountains

689
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:02,191
# And all the rhinos rub their eyes

690
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,031
# When they hear

691
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,668
# Hear the jungle rhythm

692
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,549
Did we find Mowgli yet?

693
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,232
Are you tired?

694
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,753
A little.

695
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,637
I'm sure we'll find him soon.

696
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,235
Come on. Hop up.

697
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,833
You OK up there?

698
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,592
(yawns "Uh-huh')

699
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,157
# How could it be

700
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,631
# Half as good as being free?

701
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,075
# Part of me

702
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,469
# Like the jungle rhythm

703
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,390
# Like the jungle rhythm

704
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,630
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

705
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,517
It sounded like Mowgli.

706
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,796
- Mowgli!
- Ranjan, wait!

707
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,439
Mowgli!

708
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,829
Shanti? Whoa!

709
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:21,875
Are you OK?

710
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,951
Oh, I feel "vine".

711
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,598
What are you doing up there?

712
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,636
Hold on. I'll be right...

713
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,589
- I can't believe I found you.
- I thought I'd never see you again.

714
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,875
You out here, kid?

715
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,712
Hey, Little Britches!

716
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,438
Mowgli?

717
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,509
You're not really helping.

718
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,433
- Ranjan, stop pulling.
- It's her.

719
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,835
That wild bear that carried you off.

720
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,638
- What wild...
- (Baloo roars)

721
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,236
(roars)

722
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,236
Baloo, don't! No!

723
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,951
Roar.

724
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:16,116
My poor sneezer. That hurt.

725
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:20,159
You come anywhere near Ranjan
and I'll really show you hurt.

726
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,832
- Wait!
- Don't make me do it.

727
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,639
Wait. Calm down. It's OK.

728
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,233
But he's attacking us.

729
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,039
Attacking? I'm the one
socked in the schnozzle.

730
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,111
That's because you scared her.

731
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,397
But, you told me to scarify her.

732
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,594
- What?
- No.

733
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:41,515
Wait a minute.
Mowgli, you planned this?

734
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,192
Well, I...

735
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,635
- Come on, Ranjan.
- Shanti, I can explain!

736
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,597
Don't even bother.

737
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,509
Shanti, wait!

738
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,677
Man, you weren't kidding about her.
She's bad news.

739
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,718
No, she's not. She was helping
and you scared her.

740
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,153
Man alive!

741
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,357
First, you tell me to scare her,
then, you tell me not to.

742
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,513
Kid, I only got so much room in this
noggin, and it's filling up fast.

743
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,034
You just don't understand.

744
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,918
Alright,
how's about laying it out for me?

745
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,400
Read you loud and clear, kid.

746
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,835
You wanted that girl to find you.

747
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,709
Oh!

748
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,432
Shanti! Shanti!

749
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,439
Where are you?

750
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,878
Come on!

751
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,473
There you are.

752
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:52,189
I'm so sorry.
Will you let me explain?

753
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,238
Come on, at least talk to me.

754
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,872
(growls)

755
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,672
You seem surprised to see me,
man cub.

756
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,917
I can't imagine why.

757
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,589
I wasn't going to let you get away
with what you did to me.

758
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,115
You see, you humiliated me, man cub.

759
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,351
Surely you do realise
I simply can't let you live.

760
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:22,949
Run.

761
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,797
Oh, you're going to try
and outrun me.

762
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,598
How droll.

763
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,752
Come on. This way!

764
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,991
(growls)

765
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,956
Alright. Stay here.

766
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,913
Mowgli, no!

767
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,796
Wait here.
I have to help Mowgli.

768
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,836
But I want to help Mowgli, too!

769
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,913
No, I'll be right back, I promise.
Don't move.

770
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,229
(gasps)

771
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,470
Whoa. Hold still. Calm down, kid.
Where's Mowgli?

772
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,549
Shere Khan.

773
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:25,550
Shere Khan?

774
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,028
Hold on!

775
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,189
Whoa!

776
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,474
Whoa!

777
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,592
(roaring)

778
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,599
(roars)

779
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,798
(chuckles)

780
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,039
No matter how fast you run,

781
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,395
no matter where you hide,

782
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,994
I will catch you.

783
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,719
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

784
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,155
Hurry! Hurry!

785
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,390
Faster! Faster!

786
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,755
Not another man cub.

787
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,637
Can't you go any faster?

788
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,030
Baloo!

789
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,758
What is the meaning of this?

790
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,149
- Mowgli's in trouble!
- Shanti, too!

791
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,390
Who's Shanti?

792
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,388
(gasps)

793
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,993
(thunder)

794
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,234
Take the kid! I'll help Mowgli.

795
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,069
Baloo!

796
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,479
Be careful.

797
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,111
Hmm? Mowgli?

798
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,993
Mowgli, is that you?

799
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,718
(stones rattle)

800
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,957
Mowgli?

801
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,759
Uh!

802
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:26,079
- You! Stay away from me!
- You! Why are you here?

803
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,516
- One of my den has a problem.
- I spent a night in the jungle.

804
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,909
I was attacked by a snake.
But I don't care.

805
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,833
- I'm here to help Mowgli!
- I'm here to help Mowgli!

806
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,592
- You what?
- You are?

807
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,353
I guess we're on the same side.

808
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,634
I guess so.

809
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,188
- OK.
- OK.

810
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,999
You go that way. I'll cover you.

811
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,072
(thunder)

812
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,189
(gong sounds)

813
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,474
(gong sounds)

814
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,675
(gong sounds)

815
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,399
(gong)

816
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,199
(gong)

817
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,071
(gongs)

818
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,514
(roars)

819
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,758
(crash)

820
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:50,993
Oh, no.

821
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:57,308
Well, isn't this a delightful turn
of events?

822
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,311
(chuckles)

823
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,676
So, what's it going to be, man cub?

824
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:06,833
You or your adorable
little girlfriend?

825
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,559
I'm waiting.

826
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,429
One.

827
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,470
- Two.
- No, don't!

828
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:16,993
Thr...

829
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,359
(chuckles)

830
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,477
No more games, man cub.

831
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,794
- Mowgli!
- Come on!

832
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,232
Mowgli, look out!

833
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,111
- Oh, no!
- We can do it. Jump!!

834
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,276
(roars)

835
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,235
Come on!

836
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,389
Mowgli.

837
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,758
(screams)

838
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,239
(roars)

839
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,239
(roars)

840
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:28,075
Hello, Stripes. You're looking a bit
down in the mouth today.

841
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,917
Oh, no.

842
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,356
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

843
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:39,309
I always said you had a good head
on your shoulders Khanny, me boy.

844
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:45,516
This is fantastic, playing to a
captive audience. I just love it.

845
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,955
- Bagheera.
- Mowgli.

846
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,548
It's awfully good to see you,
man cub.

847
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,154
Come on, follow me!

848
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,390
Bagheera, this is Shanti,

849
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,630
my best friend from the village.

850
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,950
(distant) Ranjan!

851
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,553
Shanti!

852
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,312
There they are!

853
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,119
- Papa! Who-hoo!
- Come on, Mowgli!

854
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,319
(distant) Mowgli!

855
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,317
Mowgli, I have to go.

856
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,069
(distant) Shanti.

857
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,637
Well? Come on, Mowgli.

858
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,073
Er...

859
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,877
Come on, Ranjan.

860
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:16,708
Oh, Baloo.

861
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,313
It's OK, kid.

862
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,231
That girl isn't so bad after all,
is she?

863
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,073
Go on, Mowgli.

864
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,995
Really?

865
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,514
Really. Don't let her get away.

866
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:40,915
Come with me.

867
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,273
Now you know I can't do that.

868
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,234
I'm gonna miss you, Papa Bear.

869
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,597
Me, too, Little Britches. Me, too.

870
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,792
(sighs)

871
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,711
Alright. There, come on, now.

872
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,109
You'd better hurry up.

873
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,669
(sighs)

874
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,196
(distant) Hey, wait!

875
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,431
Mowgli!

876
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,709
What took you so long?

877
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,276
- Race you back!
- Come on, Ranjan.

878
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:43,588
Wait! Wait!

879
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,559
- Shanti!
- We've found the children.

880
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,598
- Ranjan!
- Mummy!

881
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,910
You gave us quite a scare.

882
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,355
Shanti, I was so worried about you.

883
00:59:54,440 --> 01:00:00,231
I'm OK. I'm so sorry.
I was just trying to help Mowgli.

884
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,752
I'm sorry, sir. It's just that...

885
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,434
No, Mowgli. I'm sorry.

886
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:12,072
I should have understood that
the jungle is a part of who you are.

887
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:19,559
I'm just glad you're safe.

888
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,156
- Ranjan.
- You won't believe it.

889
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,277
There was a big old snake
and I beat him up.

890
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,078
Of course you did.

891
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:34,190
I'm proud of you, Baloo.
That was very brave...

892
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,679
Now, Baggy.

893
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,150
Don't get any ideas
about running after him

894
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:42,471
and trying to talk him
into staying with us.

895
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:45,199
He belongs in that village,
and you know it.

896
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,793
Oh, really?

897
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,270
Yes, really.
He's got his whole future there.

898
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:55,439
I'm sorry, Baloo.
You're absolutely right.

899
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,758
I'm really gonna miss that kid.

900
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,751
Me, too.

901
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,396
Wait a minute.

902
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,233
I'm having myself an idea.

903
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,630
Baloo?

904
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,990
Come on, Mowgli. We'll be late.

905
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:26,073
OK. I'm right behind you.

906
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,154
Just getting some water.

907
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:33,028
- Alright. Be careful, son.
- I will. See you, Pop.

908
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:37,919
Let's see if he remembers to actually
bring back some water this time.

909
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:42,948
Hey, Shanti, let's remember to
actually bring back water this time.

910
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,758
(laughs)

911
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:58,751
Yeah, man!

912
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,754
Man, that beat is chillin' me.

913
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:04,434
- Hi, Papa Bear.
- Hey there, Little Britches.

914
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,635
Shanti!

915
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,069
Ranjan?

916
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,838
Ow!

917
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,998
# Look for the bare necessities

918
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:24,275
# The simple bare necessities

919
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,193
# Forget about your worries
and your strife

920
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,190
Yeah, man.

921
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:31,033
# I mean, the bare necessities

922
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,509
# That's why us bears
can rest at ease

923
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:36,558
# With just the bare necessities
of life

924
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:37,709
Oh, yeah.

925
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:40,633
# With just
the bare necessities of life

926
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,199
One more time!

927
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:45,272
# With just the bare necessities
of life

928
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,759
# Yeah, man!

929
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,034
Can you hear it?

930
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,789
Yeah, man.

931
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:09,078
# Now, I'm the king of the swingers

932
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,515
# The jungle VIP

933
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,637
# I reached the top and had to stop

934
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,154
# And that's what's bothering me

935
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,993
# I want to be a man, man cub

936
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:22,753
# And stroll right into town

937
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,513
# And be just like the other men

938
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,909
# I'm tired of monkeying around

939
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,991
# Oh, oobee doo

940
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,753
# I wanna be like you

941
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,917
# I wanna walk like you

942
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,798
# Talk like you, too

943
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:40,519
# You'll see it's true

944
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,592
# An ape like me

945
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:47,514
# Can learn to be human, too

946
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,318
Whoo, baby!

947
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,511
Yeah, take it away!

948
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,909
Crazy man, crazy.

949
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,399
Let's go.

950
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,678
Here we go.

951
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,474
Come on.

952
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,438
# Bop te roonee!

953
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:14,752
- Check this out.
- This place is happening!

954
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:15,989
Can you hear it?

955
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:17,195
Oh yeah.

956
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,909
Step, step, step, step aside.

957
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,958
And I'll show you
what a real rug cutter can do.

958
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,916
Anything for my Little Britches.

959
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:31,989
Hit it, Papa Bear.

960
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,911
# Yeah, you

961
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,639
# I wanna be like you

962
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,711
# I wanna walk like you

963
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:41,758
# Talk like you, too

964
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:44,400
# You'll see it's true

965
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,756
# Someone like me

966
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:51,753
# Can learn to be someone like me

967
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:57,033
# Can learn to be someone like you

968
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,039
# Can learn to be someone like me

969
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,392
Yeah, man.

970
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:07,391
Hey, not bad.

971
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:23,037
# Sometimes when night has come

972
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:28,035
# The river sings a song

973
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:33,638
# In my dreams it seems to leave me

974
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:37,838
# Right where I belong

975
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:44,159
# Wandering everywhere

976
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:48,279
# Each way I turn is wrong

977
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:54,520
# How I'm wishing I could be there

978
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:58,798
# Right where I belong

979
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,480
# Smiles that have warmed me

980
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:05,154
# Arms that have held me

981
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:10,075
# Are all a part of who I am.

982
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:16,235
# It's never easy
leaving your friends behind

983
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:22,751
# Missing them, loving them

984
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:28,039
# Someplace was meant for me

985
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:34,309
# And that's what keeps me strong

986
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:41,951
# Somehow knowing I'll be going

987
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:46,716
# Right where I belong

988
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:50,519
# Right where I

989
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:58,518
# Home where I belong

990
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:05,837
# Check out those
chattering monkeys

991
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,797
# Swinging
through the banyan trees

992
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:12,078
# Two by two
To the jungle rhythm

993
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:15,197
# Sounds like a wolf pack
way in the distance

994
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,955
# Singing pretty harmonies
Woo-woo-woo

995
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:21,554
# To the jungle rhythm

996
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:26,118
# Now you can hightail it
out of the jungle

997
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:28,350
# But it never leaves your heart

998
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,954
# First you feel that beat
start bubbling under

999
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,429
# Then you hear the tom-toms
loud as thunder

1000
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:37,115
# It's moving me!
Sounds a lot like being free

1001
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:41,478
# - When I feel
# - When I feel, when I feel

1002
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:44,313
# Feel the jungle rhythm

1003
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:49,270
# Feel the jungle rhythm

1004
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:53,910
# Feel the jungle rhythm

1005
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:57,593
# Feel the jungle rhythm
